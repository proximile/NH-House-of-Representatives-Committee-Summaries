thank you so much Mr chair good morning
 
00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 align:start position:0%
committee I'm so happy to be here and uh
 
00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 align:start position:0%
see so many new faces on this committee
 
00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 align:start position:0%
so I'm here today to present uh hb30
 
00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 align:start position:0%
and this bill allows the County
 
00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 align:start position:0%
Commissioners to exempt the County chief
 
00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 align:start position:0%
administrative officer from compulsory
 
00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 align:start position:0%
membership in the State Retirement
 
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.309 align:start position:0%
membership in the State Retirement
System

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
System
 
00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 align:start position:0%
if you recall some of you who are here
 
00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 align:start position:0%
this bill came to the house in the form
 
00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:35.879 align:start position:0%
of HB 1561 and HB 141 in 2020 and 2021
 
00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:38.030 align:start position:0%
of HB 1561 and HB 141 in 2020 and 2021
respectively

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 align:start position:0%
respectively
 
00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 align:start position:0%
both times they passed this committee
 
00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 align:start position:0%
and were subsequently added to the
 
00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 align:start position:0%
Omnibus bills that got tabled during
 
00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.729 align:start position:0%
Omnibus bills that got tabled during
covet

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 align:start position:0%
covet
 
00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 align:start position:0%
so it's time that we get this issue
 
00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 align:start position:0%
settled and passed
 
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
there's no need for our County managers
 
00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 align:start position:0%
to be compelled to participate in the
 
00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 align:start position:0%
state retirement system especially if
 
00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 align:start position:0%
they already have retirement plans
 
00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.070 align:start position:0%
they already have retirement plans
elsewhere

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 align:start position:0%
elsewhere
 
00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 align:start position:0%
most of them have come up through the
 
00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 align:start position:0%
system and have already vested in group
 
00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 align:start position:0%
one and therefore very likely to stay in
 
00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 align:start position:0%
the retirement system but some may have
 
00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 align:start position:0%
an exemption exception
 
00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 align:start position:0%
and we should give them the right to
 
00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.130 align:start position:0%
and we should give them the right to
choose

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 align:start position:0%
choose
 
00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 align:start position:0%
the financial impact to the state
 
00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 align:start position:0%
retirement system is nil as a as we have
 
00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 align:start position:0%
been shown in the fiscal impact section
 
00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 align:start position:0%
where um
 
00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 align:start position:0%
they the New Hampshire retirement system
 
00:03:35.149 --> 00:03:35.159 align:start position:0%
folks stated that the bill would have an
 
00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
indeterminable impact on County
 
00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 align:start position:0%
expenditures in fiscal year 2026 as the
 
00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 align:start position:0%
rates have already been set for fiscal
 
00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 align:start position:0%
year 2024 and fiscal year 2025 and the
 
00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 align:start position:0%
system also states that the impact would
 
00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 align:start position:0%
only affect up to 10 nhrs members and
 
00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
would have a small impact less than 0.1
 
00:03:57.589 --> 00:03:57.599 align:start position:0%
percent on the entire payroll from which
 
00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239 align:start position:0%
um given the history of this legislation
 
00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 align:start position:0%
and the support that this committee has
 
00:04:10.929 --> 00:04:10.939 align:start position:0%
given this legislation
 
00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 align:start position:0%
I hope that we can pass this through the
 
00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 align:start position:0%
committee again get it through the house
 
00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
and hope for a better outcome
 
00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 align:start position:0%
and that's really all I have to say in
 
00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 align:start position:0%
introducing this bill
 
00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are you taking
 
00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 align:start position:0%
questions sure
 
00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:33.479 align:start position:0%
yes representative O'Brien thank you Mr
 
00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:34.790 align:start position:0%
yes representative O'Brien thank you Mr
chair

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:37.259 align:start position:0%
um representative are you familiar I
 
00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:40.259 align:start position:0%
think it's RSA 100a
 
00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 align:start position:0%
which basically envelops or Embraces the
 
00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 align:start position:0%
retirement system that in the example a
 
00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
community cannot back out
 
00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 align:start position:0%
of the retirement system unless they
 
00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 align:start position:0%
meet all liability uh unfunded liability
 
00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:00.540 align:start position:0%
and would that apply in the case that
 
00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 align:start position:0%
you're presenting today
 
00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:05.699 align:start position:0%
I actually am not sure
 
00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 align:start position:0%
um I would imagine well perhaps maybe
 
00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:09.419 align:start position:0%
I'll let you off the hook maybe somebody
 
00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 align:start position:0%
that would testify and clean that up
 
00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 align:start position:0%
well I do know that the this would bring
 
00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:17.220 align:start position:0%
it in line to how we operate with the
 
00:05:20.749 --> 00:05:20.759 align:start position:0%
municipalities too I think they also
 
00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:29.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much
 
00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:33.660 align:start position:0%
appreciate it
 
00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
and I would like to welcome
 
00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:49.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
good morning chair members of the
 
00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:54.060 align:start position:0%
committee I'm Carol Maguire representing
 
00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360 align:start position:0%
Merrimack District 27 which is the towns
 
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.120 align:start position:0%
of Allenstown Dunbarton Epsom and
 
00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:03.189 align:start position:0%
of Allenstown Dunbarton Epsom and
Hooksett

00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:03.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:07.860 align:start position:0%
new district and I'm in support of house
 
00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:10.199 align:start position:0%
bill 30.
 
00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:12.360 align:start position:0%
one thing that happened
 
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
recently in Merrimack County is that we
 
00:06:20.749 --> 00:06:20.759 align:start position:0%
found our County Corrections director to
 
00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:24.479 align:start position:0%
be interested and qualified in being the
 
00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:26.280 align:start position:0%
chief executive
 
00:06:28.969 --> 00:06:28.979 align:start position:0%
but since he had spent his career in
 
00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:31.620 align:start position:0%
group two he was not the least bit
 
00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:35.580 align:start position:0%
interested in taking contributing to a
 
00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
group one pension
 
00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:41.100 align:start position:0%
for some few years that would if
 
00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:44.060 align:start position:0%
anything dilute his benefits
 
00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:46.860 align:start position:0%
the way the system is set up
 
00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:48.900 align:start position:0%
if you're in group two for most of your
 
00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:50.580 align:start position:0%
career and you have a small amount of
 
00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:51.780 align:start position:0%
group one
 
00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:53.689 align:start position:0%
group one
it

00:06:53.689 --> 00:06:53.699 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:06:56.689 --> 00:06:56.699 align:start position:0%
not only it means you get a tiny amount
 
00:06:59.110 --> 00:06:59.120 align:start position:0%
of Social Security which is then docked
 
00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
and your your pension is less because
 
00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:05.340 align:start position:0%
the factors for between group one and
 
00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:06.780 align:start position:0%
group two are different
 
00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:10.629 align:start position:0%
group two are different
so

00:07:10.629 --> 00:07:10.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:14.940 align:start position:0%
they the county was looking for a way to
 
00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:17.220 align:start position:0%
not have this person be in the
 
00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
retirement system
 
00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
I don't know exactly what they did I
 
00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:23.160 align:start position:0%
think they
 
00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:26.580 align:start position:0%
appointed him to a fixed term which is
 
00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:28.440 align:start position:0%
generally optional
 
00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:30.650 align:start position:0%
generally optional
but

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:30.660 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
that is a problem that may come up again
 
00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:36.300 align:start position:0%
if someone who is
 
00:07:38.689 --> 00:07:38.699 align:start position:0%
under consideration for the county
 
00:07:41.029 --> 00:07:41.039 align:start position:0%
executive has a group two background
 
00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:44.520 align:start position:0%
there this isn't going to be favorable
 
00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:48.060 align:start position:0%
other County Executives some of them as
 
00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:50.340 align:start position:0%
representative O'Brien said come up
 
00:07:52.029 --> 00:07:52.039 align:start position:0%
through the
 
00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:55.080 align:start position:0%
state and County governments and they're
 
00:07:57.469 --> 00:07:57.479 align:start position:0%
fine with staying in the retirement
 
00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
system but others
 
00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
travel around they come from out of
 
00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:06.660 align:start position:0%
state they come from private or Private
 
00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:07.790 align:start position:0%
state they come from private or Private
Industry

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:07.800 align:start position:0%
Industry
 
00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:10.800 align:start position:0%
and being in
 
00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:13.380 align:start position:0%
the retirement system for a short period
 
00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:15.240 align:start position:0%
of time
 
00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:19.340 align:start position:0%
at the end of your career is not really
 
00:08:23.089 --> 00:08:23.099 align:start position:0%
useful and this applies to other defined
 
00:08:25.969 --> 00:08:25.979 align:start position:0%
benefit pensions as well because you're
 
00:08:28.129 --> 00:08:28.139 align:start position:0%
only working for a few years you don't
 
00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:31.080 align:start position:0%
have time to build build up credit and
 
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
so they don't want to be in
 
00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:35.810 align:start position:0%
so they don't want to be in
um

00:08:35.810 --> 00:08:35.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:38.329 --> 00:08:38.339 align:start position:0%
in the system because if you stay there
 
00:08:41.089 --> 00:08:41.099 align:start position:0%
for five years and then you finish your
 
00:08:42.589 --> 00:08:42.599 align:start position:0%
term and go on
 
00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:47.220 align:start position:0%
you get back your contributions plus a
 
00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:48.470 align:start position:0%
you get back your contributions plus a
nominal

00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
nominal
 
00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:52.160 align:start position:0%
return whereas if you had put that money
 
00:08:54.829 --> 00:08:54.839 align:start position:0%
into a
 
00:08:58.310 --> 00:08:58.320 align:start position:0%
another type of retirement benefit you
 
00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:01.140 align:start position:0%
would be much better off you also lose
 
00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:03.540 align:start position:0%
the employer contributions
 
00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:06.889 align:start position:0%
the employer contributions
and

00:09:06.889 --> 00:09:06.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:06.899 --> 00:09:09.170 align:start position:0%
 
the

00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:09.180 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:13.320 align:start position:0%
if the committee is concerned about
 
00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:14.630 align:start position:0%
if the committee is concerned about
the

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:16.370 align:start position:0%
the
um

00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:16.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:19.740 align:start position:0%
the unfunded liability on due on this
 
00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:20.930 align:start position:0%
the unfunded liability on due on this
position

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:20.940 align:start position:0%
position
 
00:09:23.509 --> 00:09:23.519 align:start position:0%
we could add in that they paid the
 
00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:25.680 align:start position:0%
unfunded portion as if it were in the
 
00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:28.860 align:start position:0%
retirement system they should but that's
 
00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:29.630 align:start position:0%
retirement system they should but that's
a

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:29.640 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:31.800 align:start position:0%
a secondary effect
 
00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:35.100 align:start position:0%
there there are there is only one chief
 
00:09:36.949 --> 00:09:36.959 align:start position:0%
executive Per County
 
00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
there are more City
 
00:09:42.889 --> 00:09:42.899 align:start position:0%
managers and so forth that are allowed
 
00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:44.940 align:start position:0%
to be Exempted from this from the
 
00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:46.860 align:start position:0%
retirement system and they don't pay
 
00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:49.140 align:start position:0%
into the uh
 
00:09:52.329 --> 00:09:52.339 align:start position:0%
um toward the unfunded liability
 
00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
so I in a matter of equity I think we
 
00:09:57.829 --> 00:09:57.839 align:start position:0%
should not do that
 
00:09:59.570 --> 00:09:59.580 align:start position:0%
and I'll be glad to answer the questions
 
00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
I I can
 
00:10:03.889 --> 00:10:03.899 align:start position:0%
thank you representative McGuire any
 
00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:06.360 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative O'Brien
 
00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:09.300 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:10.370 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:10.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:12.660 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire I'm going to pick
 
00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:15.480 align:start position:0%
at your expertise that I deeply respect
 
00:10:17.449 --> 00:10:17.459 align:start position:0%
here on the matter you're almost as good
 
00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:21.180 align:start position:0%
as me with the pension system almost
 
00:10:24.769 --> 00:10:24.779 align:start position:0%
but what I'm kind of concerned with part
 
00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:28.200 align:start position:0%
of the safeguards is we have uh RSA 100a
 
00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:31.740 align:start position:0%
I and I think you're familiar with that
 
00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:34.140 align:start position:0%
and so much once you say you could want
 
00:10:36.949 --> 00:10:36.959 align:start position:0%
to belong to the system you're in the
 
00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:39.060 align:start position:0%
particular system and we don't really
 
00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:42.420 align:start position:0%
want communities to back out of it you
 
00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
know uh wants them to stay invested and
 
00:10:50.449 --> 00:10:50.459 align:start position:0%
to grow and what does not are we gonna
 
00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:53.100 align:start position:0%
start I understand it's only 30 people
 
00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:55.560 align:start position:0%
and I think about 10 people 10 people
 
00:10:58.069 --> 00:10:58.079 align:start position:0%
the numbers are relatively small and I
 
00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:01.620 align:start position:0%
realize that but I'm just afraid of the
 
00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
slippery slope so can you uh smooth me
 
00:11:07.069 --> 00:11:07.079 align:start position:0%
over a little bit well representative
 
00:11:09.829 --> 00:11:09.839 align:start position:0%
O'Brien right now
 
00:11:09.839 --> 00:11:11.210 align:start position:0%
O'Brien right now
the

00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:11.220 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:13.620 align:start position:0%
city managers and so forth can be
 
00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:14.870 align:start position:0%
city managers and so forth can be
Exempted

00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
Exempted
 
00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
if which is a larger group than County
 
00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:21.190 align:start position:0%
if which is a larger group than County
executives

00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:21.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:24.300 align:start position:0%
unclassified state employees can be
 
00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
Exempted people who are appointed to
 
00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:30.260 align:start position:0%
fixed term positions are can be Exempted
 
00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:32.940 align:start position:0%
the membership of the retirement system
 
00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:36.720 align:start position:0%
is optional for a
 
00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:40.500 align:start position:0%
a group of types of positions that are
 
00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:42.620 align:start position:0%
likely to be
 
00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
late career
 
00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
positions and for limited times and also
 
00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
oddly enough for elected officials
 
00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
so your county sheriff is probably a
 
00:11:59.569 --> 00:11:59.579 align:start position:0%
member of the retirement system because
 
00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
he would most likely have come up
 
00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:03.590 align:start position:0%
he would most likely have come up
through

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:05.269 align:start position:0%
through
um

00:12:05.269 --> 00:12:05.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:07.560 align:start position:0%
through the police or Corrections office
 
00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:08.990 align:start position:0%
through the police or Corrections office
however

00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
however
 
00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
your county attorney
 
00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
may or may not be in the system
 
00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:16.740 align:start position:0%
depending on whether he was say the
 
00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:19.200 align:start position:0%
Concord city prosecutor before he got
 
00:12:21.829 --> 00:12:21.839 align:start position:0%
elected or he was in private uh had a
 
00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
private business
 
00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:25.320 align:start position:0%
you know and it's it's up to the elected
 
00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:26.509 align:start position:0%
you know and it's it's up to the elected
official

00:12:26.509 --> 00:12:26.519 align:start position:0%
official
 
00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:29.940 align:start position:0%
and so adding the County chief executive
 
00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:31.810 align:start position:0%
and so adding the County chief executive
officer

00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:31.820 align:start position:0%
officer
 
00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
simply makes the statute more consistent
 
00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:38.820 align:start position:0%
and on who can be optionally in the
 
00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:40.730 align:start position:0%
and on who can be optionally in the
system

00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:40.740 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:12:42.889 --> 00:12:42.899 align:start position:0%
and I thank you for the clarity thank
 
00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:44.399 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair
 
00:12:47.629 --> 00:12:47.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:50.449 --> 00:12:50.459 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so representative
 
00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:53.700 align:start position:0%
McGuire if you recall uh a number of
 
00:12:56.569 --> 00:12:56.579 align:start position:0%
years ago we changed the statute and the
 
00:12:58.069 --> 00:12:58.079 align:start position:0%
arrangement with the retirement system
 
00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:00.300 align:start position:0%
with regard to people coming in from out
 
00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
of state and buying into the system
 
00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:05.820 align:start position:0%
right because it was determined that in
 
00:13:09.829 --> 00:13:09.839 align:start position:0%
point of fact this did not uh this was
 
00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
not in equity with regard to the people
 
00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
who had come up and been part of the
 
00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:16.440 align:start position:0%
system for years and it was harmful to
 
00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:18.360 align:start position:0%
determined to be harmful to the system
 
00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
so we stopped that people could no
 
00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
longer come in from out of state and we
 
00:13:28.129 --> 00:13:28.139 align:start position:0%
do it was referenced in the earlier
 
00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:31.620 align:start position:0%
testimony uh that very often County
 
00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:35.820 align:start position:0%
Executives in this category uh are
 
00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:37.560 align:start position:0%
coming in from out of state
 
00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:42.060 align:start position:0%
and it would there uh would would that
 
00:13:44.389 --> 00:13:44.399 align:start position:0%
be an analogous situation with regard to
 
00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:47.820 align:start position:0%
the to the being overall detrimental to
 
00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
the system
 
00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:53.220 align:start position:0%
if you know I don't believe it's exactly
 
00:13:56.690 --> 00:13:56.700 align:start position:0%
analogous it's more a matter of being
 
00:13:59.750 --> 00:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
fair to the individuals involved
 
00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
the system is so minimal that
 
00:14:06.769 --> 00:14:06.779 align:start position:0%
it's not going to matter but considering
 
00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:09.420 align:start position:0%
that other equivalent positions have
 
00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:11.940 align:start position:0%
optional membership this just adds
 
00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:13.940 align:start position:0%
another another position like that
 
00:14:16.129 --> 00:14:16.139 align:start position:0%
representative Fitzpatrick is more of an
 
00:14:19.009 --> 00:14:19.019 align:start position:0%
expert on this than I am but uh
 
00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:22.680 align:start position:0%
follow-up so uh in other words it's it's
 
00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:25.380 align:start position:0%
it's the same principle in one respect
 
00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:28.680 align:start position:0%
but because the numbers in comparison
 
00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:31.380 align:start position:0%
with people coming in from out of state
 
00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
across the Spectrum their numbers would
 
00:14:36.829 --> 00:14:36.839 align:start position:0%
be considerable whereas these numbers
 
00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:39.240 align:start position:0%
are so small that it really the impact
 
00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:42.300 align:start position:0%
is effectively now well it's also that
 
00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
the people coming from out of state as
 
00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:47.720 align:start position:0%
police officers or teachers or whatever
 
00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:50.160 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:52.740 align:start position:0%
thinking about buying their entire
 
00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:53.710 align:start position:0%
thinking about buying their entire
service

00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:53.720 align:start position:0%
service
 
00:14:56.329 --> 00:14:56.339 align:start position:0%
in this case someone is saying well I
 
00:14:59.569 --> 00:14:59.579 align:start position:0%
want to stop whatever service I had
 
00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:02.220 align:start position:0%
prior to starting this job and I'll and
 
00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:04.940 align:start position:0%
I'll deal with my with this job
 
00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:06.470 align:start position:0%
I'll deal with my with this job
differently

00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
differently
 
00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:09.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:11.449 --> 00:15:11.459 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:13.980 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
00:15:15.769 --> 00:15:15.779 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:15:18.769 --> 00:15:18.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:22.069 --> 00:15:22.079 align:start position:0%
um I'm sure that you and I are both
 
00:15:23.449 --> 00:15:23.459 align:start position:0%
aware of
 
00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:25.500 align:start position:0%
the past history
 
00:15:27.829 --> 00:15:27.839 align:start position:0%
of this field particularly in this
 
00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
committee it has technically passed Edna
 
00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
twice and gone through the house and
 
00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:37.800 align:start position:0%
been accepted but then faltered in the
 
00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
senate for some reason I believe in both
 
00:15:44.509 --> 00:15:44.519 align:start position:0%
cases it was endorsed by our counterpart
 
00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:47.940 align:start position:0%
in the Senate Edna and I was curious if
 
00:15:52.009 --> 00:15:52.019 align:start position:0%
you have an inkling as to why the Senate
 
00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:54.120 align:start position:0%
has turned this down if they if we need
 
00:15:56.750 --> 00:15:56.760 align:start position:0%
some sort of fix to it to get through
 
00:15:58.850 --> 00:15:58.860 align:start position:0%
that hurt
 
00:15:58.860 --> 00:15:59.449 align:start position:0%
that hurt
um

00:15:59.449 --> 00:15:59.459 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:04.129 --> 00:16:04.139 align:start position:0%
I didn't study the report but
 
00:16:07.069 --> 00:16:07.079 align:start position:0%
in both cases
 
00:16:10.189 --> 00:16:10.199 align:start position:0%
um it was it wasn't voted down it was
 
00:16:10.199 --> 00:16:11.329 align:start position:0%
um it was it wasn't voted down it was
tabled

00:16:11.329 --> 00:16:11.339 align:start position:0%
tabled
 
00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:15.060 align:start position:0%
in one case it was tabled during covid
 
00:16:19.129 --> 00:16:19.139 align:start position:0%
during 2020 when a great many worthwhile
 
00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:21.540 align:start position:0%
bills were tabled and died in both the
 
00:16:23.569 --> 00:16:23.579 align:start position:0%
house and the Senate
 
00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:27.420 align:start position:0%
the other one was tabled
 
00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:33.949 --> 00:16:33.959 align:start position:0%
with the Senate Edna recommendation of
 
00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:36.420 align:start position:0%
what to pass and I don't know how how
 
00:16:38.629 --> 00:16:38.639 align:start position:0%
that happened but I think we should look
 
00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
into it
 
00:16:43.189 --> 00:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
um I will point out uh the last one the
 
00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:46.440 align:start position:0%
one that I actually amended to change to
 
00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:49.740 align:start position:0%
this same bill basically
 
00:16:51.949 --> 00:16:51.959 align:start position:0%
ought to pass in the Senate failed 11 to
 
00:16:55.009 --> 00:16:55.019 align:start position:0%
12 and then they laid it on the table so
 
00:16:58.189 --> 00:16:58.199 align:start position:0%
there obviously were some objections I
 
00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:00.180 align:start position:0%
didn't know if you had insight into what
 
00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:02.540 align:start position:0%
those were thank you I'm afraid I I
 
00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:05.360 align:start position:0%
don't know how the Senate works
 
00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:09.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:11.569 --> 00:17:11.579 align:start position:0%
representative O'Brien
 
00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
thank you um representative McGuire uh
 
00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:17.160 align:start position:0%
if you be so kind
 
00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:17.929 align:start position:0%
if you be so kind
um

00:17:17.929 --> 00:17:17.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
personally I'm against double dipping
 
00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
and different things like that so if
 
00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:26.040 align:start position:0%
this bill passes which it has had the
 
00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:27.720 align:start position:0%
history in the past
 
00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:31.620 align:start position:0%
uh is that person once they went to this
 
00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:34.380 align:start position:0%
new system that is proposed are they
 
00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:38.820 align:start position:0%
retired and then able to collect their
 
00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:48.289 --> 00:17:48.299 align:start position:0%
they would be in this if they had worked
 
00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:49.860 align:start position:0%
in the new and the New Hampshire
 
00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
retirement system up until this point
 
00:17:57.650 --> 00:17:57.660 align:start position:0%
they would be as eligible to retire as
 
00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:01.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:05.100 align:start position:0%
your example your county sheriff is it's
 
00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:08.460 align:start position:0%
optional and so he he could in fact
 
00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:11.700 align:start position:0%
choose to retire collect this pension
 
00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:13.320 align:start position:0%
and collect his pay as the county
 
00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:15.230 align:start position:0%
and collect his pay as the county
sheriff

00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:15.240 align:start position:0%
sheriff
 
00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:18.660 align:start position:0%
and that is a
 
00:18:21.169 --> 00:18:21.179 align:start position:0%
a factor in the retirement system that
 
00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
exists for all those people who are
 
00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:26.940 align:start position:0%
Exempted and I believe all pretty much
 
00:18:29.029 --> 00:18:29.039 align:start position:0%
all County Sheriffs are retired and
 
00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:31.980 align:start position:0%
collecting a pay a paycheck
 
00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:34.430 align:start position:0%
collecting a pay a paycheck
but

00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:34.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
that's a broader issue than this one
 
00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:38.150 align:start position:0%
that's a broader issue than this one
person

00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:38.160 align:start position:0%
person
 
00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:40.200 align:start position:0%
thank you representative thank you Mr
 
00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
chair representative true
 
00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:44.700 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:46.980 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question I
 
00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
realize basically the only change is
 
00:18:51.049 --> 00:18:51.059 align:start position:0%
you're adding counties they are adding
 
00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:55.380 align:start position:0%
counties along with municipalities
 
00:18:57.590 --> 00:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
and I know it's it's already in the uh
 
00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:00.720 align:start position:0%
already in the RSA but
 
00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
could you explain starting maybe it
 
00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
would line six
 
00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
because it's it's talking about RSA 100
 
00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
that has been mentioned before
 
00:19:12.529 --> 00:19:12.539 align:start position:0%
maybe just explain to me
 
00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
um what's going on there
 
00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:17.580 align:start position:0%
so that if somebody asked me I could at
 
00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:19.980 align:start position:0%
least make it and tell them what's going
 
00:19:22.789 --> 00:19:22.799 align:start position:0%
on starting on line six
 
00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
talks about
 
00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:29.029 align:start position:0%
talks about
uh

00:19:29.029 --> 00:19:29.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:32.340 align:start position:0%
that is a transition Clause from when
 
00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
the retirement system was initiated in
 
00:19:39.529 --> 00:19:39.539 align:start position:0%
the 1960s so it's really kind of there
 
00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:43.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:46.620 align:start position:0%
as at least that's the way I read it
 
00:19:50.210 --> 00:19:50.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
seeing no one thank you representative
 
00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
McGuire okay thank you and I will uh
 
00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:01.620 align:start position:0%
welcome our distinguished friend from
 
00:20:04.909 --> 00:20:04.919 align:start position:0%
the nhrs uh Marty Carlin to this
 
00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:16.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:19.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair for the record uh
 
00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
Marty Carlin uh representing the New
 
00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:23.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire retirement system uh nhrs
 
00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:25.260 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a position on this bill we
 
00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
see it as a policy question for the
 
00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:29.580 align:start position:0%
legislature as planned sponsor
 
00:20:33.490 --> 00:20:33.500 align:start position:0%
essentially is this change necessary to
 
00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
improve the the quality and quantity of
 
00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:37.140 align:start position:0%
candidates for these County
 
00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
Administrator positions and keep people
 
00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:41.340 align:start position:0%
in it so we don't have a position on the
 
00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:43.320 align:start position:0%
bill I signed up just for informational
 
00:20:45.409 --> 00:20:45.419 align:start position:0%
purposes to give a little history on the
 
00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
current exemption optional exemption for
 
00:20:50.570 --> 00:20:50.580 align:start position:0%
municipal managers and and some other
 
00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
general information and then take any
 
00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:54.120 align:start position:0%
questions you may have
 
00:20:58.850 --> 00:20:58.860 align:start position:0%
um the exemption in a22 for uh Municipal
 
00:20:58.860 --> 00:20:59.990 align:start position:0%
um the exemption in a22 for uh Municipal
uh

00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
chief administrative officers was put
 
00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:04.980 align:start position:0%
into the statute back in the early 70s
 
00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
which is a bit before my time so I'm not
 
00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:08.520 align:start position:0%
sure of the rationale but it's been
 
00:21:10.909 --> 00:21:10.919 align:start position:0%
there for many many years and this
 
00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
allows upon hiring
 
00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
um the governing body to choose to
 
00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:19.260 align:start position:0%
exempt their that position from nhrs
 
00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:22.260 align:start position:0%
it's it's tied for the initial higher
 
00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:23.400 align:start position:0%
you can't retro you know somebody
 
00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:25.140 align:start position:0%
couldn't be in for five years and then
 
00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:27.240 align:start position:0%
the they could become Exempted after
 
00:21:29.570 --> 00:21:29.580 align:start position:0%
that and that same language carries over
 
00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
with the inclusion of County
 
00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:32.770 align:start position:0%
with the inclusion of County
administrators

00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:32.780 align:start position:0%
administrators
 
00:21:35.450 --> 00:21:35.460 align:start position:0%
as other people have said this is
 
00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
there's ten counties so these are 10
 
00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:40.500 align:start position:0%
positions uh out of over 24
 
00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
000 contributing member positions and a
 
00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
payroll of around a billion and a half
 
00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:48.900 align:start position:0%
so so the um you know the the actuary
 
00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:50.460 align:start position:0%
determined that you know it would be an
 
00:21:52.669 --> 00:21:52.679 align:start position:0%
indeterminably small
 
00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:55.260 align:start position:0%
um you know cost going forward if all of
 
00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
them were Exempted
 
00:21:59.930 --> 00:21:59.940 align:start position:0%
um currently the as again alluded to
 
00:22:01.549 --> 00:22:01.559 align:start position:0%
um by by a prior speaker there is
 
00:22:05.289 --> 00:22:05.299 align:start position:0%
another way to exempt these positions
 
00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:08.720 align:start position:0%
currently which is uh the the county
 
00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:11.100 align:start position:0%
governing body would have would hire
 
00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:14.340 align:start position:0%
them and appoint them for a fixed term
 
00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:16.380 align:start position:0%
um and they during which they could only
 
00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
be removed for cause not as an at-will
 
00:22:22.450 --> 00:22:22.460 align:start position:0%
employee like most employees are uh
 
00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
based We Believe Three Counties have
 
00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:27.480 align:start position:0%
done that currently with their existing
 
00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:29.330 align:start position:0%
done that currently with their existing
administrators

00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:29.340 align:start position:0%
administrators
 
00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
um so so that you know they but um
 
00:22:34.370 --> 00:22:34.380 align:start position:0%
you know that that's just another way to
 
00:22:36.409 --> 00:22:36.419 align:start position:0%
do this so uh be glad to answer any
 
00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:37.980 align:start position:0%
questions any of the members may have
 
00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:40.380 align:start position:0%
about this and uh
 
00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:42.780 align:start position:0%
actually one one last thing too the the
 
00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
question about line six uh from one of
 
00:22:47.029 --> 00:22:47.039 align:start position:0%
the Reps that that's a provision that
 
00:22:49.909 --> 00:22:49.919 align:start position:0%
this overall provision if an if a full
 
00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:53.400 align:start position:0%
participate If an employer opts to join
 
00:22:55.909 --> 00:22:55.919 align:start position:0%
the retirement system on Moss for all of
 
00:22:59.390 --> 00:22:59.400 align:start position:0%
its employees that language about buying
 
00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:02.460 align:start position:0%
time allows members who are working for
 
00:23:04.970 --> 00:23:04.980 align:start position:0%
that Community before they joined nhrs
 
00:23:07.010 --> 00:23:07.020 align:start position:0%
up to a year to buy their past
 
00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
experience with that town as nhrs
 
00:23:10.850 --> 00:23:10.860 align:start position:0%
service so it's nothing to do with um
 
00:23:12.649 --> 00:23:12.659 align:start position:0%
what what's in front of you today the
 
00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:17.820 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:20.100 align:start position:0%
yes representative shewitt
 
00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:25.860 align:start position:0%
question Mr Carlin uh you talked about
 
00:23:28.789 --> 00:23:28.799 align:start position:0%
um I guess you'd call it a workaround uh
 
00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:31.020 align:start position:0%
if a county appoints their administrator
 
00:23:33.049 --> 00:23:33.059 align:start position:0%
for a fixed term
 
00:23:35.870 --> 00:23:35.880 align:start position:0%
uh would they then be allowed to do that
 
00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:38.940 align:start position:0%
for an additional fixed term is there
 
00:23:41.029 --> 00:23:41.039 align:start position:0%
any limitation to that no there's no
 
00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:43.740 align:start position:0%
limit on fixed term appointments many
 
00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:45.480 align:start position:0%
Commissioners who've served the state a
 
00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:47.940 align:start position:0%
long time it's a similar concept to that
 
00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:50.820 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
yes representative O'Brien thank you uh
 
00:23:57.710 --> 00:23:57.720 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and uh Mr Collins
 
00:24:00.529 --> 00:24:00.539 align:start position:0%
this probably has very little impact on
 
00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:05.400 align:start position:0%
the uaal than not to be of concern
 
00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:07.980 align:start position:0%
any any impact is is you know of some
 
00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:09.960 align:start position:0%
level of concern but this is a de
 
00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:11.029 align:start position:0%
level of concern but this is a de
minimis

00:24:11.029 --> 00:24:11.039 align:start position:0%
minimis
 
00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:17.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:18.780 align:start position:0%
representative true
 
00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:20.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Chen thank you for taking
 
00:24:21.409 --> 00:24:21.419 align:start position:0%
my question
 
00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:23.220 align:start position:0%
you would mentioned that some counties
 
00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:25.130 align:start position:0%
you would mentioned that some counties
uh

00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:25.140 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:28.140 align:start position:0%
have already doing this that the work
 
00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:30.900 align:start position:0%
around with a fixed term
 
00:24:33.409 --> 00:24:33.419 align:start position:0%
so if this weren't to pass
 
00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:34.980 align:start position:0%
there is still the option there's
 
00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
there's still the paid a way for
 
00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:38.700 align:start position:0%
counties to
 
00:24:42.529 --> 00:24:42.539 align:start position:0%
to offer this to their executives
 
00:24:42.539 --> 00:24:44.270 align:start position:0%
to offer this to their executives
I

00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:44.280 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:47.100 align:start position:0%
I'm not I'm looking over here and I'm
 
00:24:48.409 --> 00:24:48.419 align:start position:0%
going to start talking and attorney
 
00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
Kavanaugh who's from nhrs and is joining
 
00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:53.460 align:start position:0%
me to testify on the last bill
 
00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
um I think once their fixed term is over
 
00:24:57.049 --> 00:24:57.059 align:start position:0%
and they're rehired that would be the
 
00:24:58.549 --> 00:24:58.559 align:start position:0%
point at which they could exempt them or
 
00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:00.240 align:start position:0%
no right
 
00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:04.669 --> 00:25:04.679 align:start position:0%
would you like to come up to the
 
00:25:08.270 --> 00:25:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:09.770 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:09.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:10.909 --> 00:25:10.919 align:start position:0%
so this is the
 
00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
thing that applies to officials
 
00:25:14.570 --> 00:25:14.580 align:start position:0%
appointed to a fixed term which is an
 
00:25:16.430 --> 00:25:16.440 align:start position:0%
historical phrase that comes from the
 
00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:20.280 align:start position:0%
old state plan prior to 1967. however
 
00:25:22.970 --> 00:25:22.980 align:start position:0%
and those are typically
 
00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:26.580 align:start position:0%
um top level Executives at the division
 
00:25:28.669 --> 00:25:28.679 align:start position:0%
directors and the like that are
 
00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:31.140 align:start position:0%
appointed pursuant to a statute as
 
00:25:33.289 --> 00:25:33.299 align:start position:0%
nominated by the governor approved by
 
00:25:35.149 --> 00:25:35.159 align:start position:0%
the executive Council can only be
 
00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
removed from cause under RSA 5 after a
 
00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:42.529 align:start position:0%
removed from cause under RSA 5 after a
hearing

00:25:42.529 --> 00:25:42.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
technically the law also applies to
 
00:25:46.549 --> 00:25:46.559 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions such as the
 
00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
county they don't have statutes that
 
00:25:52.010 --> 00:25:52.020 align:start position:0%
apply fixed terms or provide for for
 
00:25:55.370 --> 00:25:55.380 align:start position:0%
cause hearings and so to parallel what
 
00:25:58.669 --> 00:25:58.679 align:start position:0%
the statutes that apply to state
 
00:26:01.730 --> 00:26:01.740 align:start position:0%
uh positions we have had a long-standing
 
00:26:05.210 --> 00:26:05.220 align:start position:0%
administrative interpretation that to be
 
00:26:08.029 --> 00:26:08.039 align:start position:0%
appointed for a fixed term you have to
 
00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:10.020 align:start position:0%
have in your contract a provision that
 
00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
says you can only be removed for cause
 
00:26:15.409 --> 00:26:15.419 align:start position:0%
and there are three counties that have
 
00:26:17.090 --> 00:26:17.100 align:start position:0%
done that with their County
 
00:26:20.269 --> 00:26:20.279 align:start position:0%
administrators but that can also you
 
00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:22.020 align:start position:0%
know for personnel and other reasons not
 
00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
be desirable you know other counties may
 
00:26:26.630 --> 00:26:26.640 align:start position:0%
say we'd rather have someone at will and
 
00:26:29.269 --> 00:26:29.279 align:start position:0%
not have to uh have a foreclosed
 
00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:31.620 align:start position:0%
provision by passing this bill you would
 
00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
allow them to exempt to people without
 
00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:35.820 align:start position:0%
having that restriction that's currently
 
00:26:40.130 --> 00:26:40.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:42.890 --> 00:26:42.900 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt
 
00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and which three
 
00:26:47.570 --> 00:26:47.580 align:start position:0%
counties are those
 
00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:55.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:00.529 --> 00:27:00.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:04.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:05.630 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:05.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:10.909 --> 00:27:10.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
so we're only talking 10 people
 
00:27:16.789 --> 00:27:16.799 align:start position:0%
so just the fact that we're talking such
 
00:27:19.669 --> 00:27:19.679 align:start position:0%
a small amount of people that would mean
 
00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:21.480 align:start position:0%
that the impact on the unfunded
 
00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
liability is pretty small is that not
 
00:27:27.769 --> 00:27:27.779 align:start position:0%
true that is true
 
00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
00:27:42.409 --> 00:27:42.419 align:start position:0%
I just have one on that same vein excuse
 
00:27:42.419 --> 00:27:43.490 align:start position:0%
I just have one on that same vein excuse
me

00:27:43.490 --> 00:27:43.500 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:45.720 align:start position:0%
ten it affects 10 people but three of
 
00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:47.220 align:start position:0%
them are effectively not in the
 
00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
retirement system at the present moment
 
00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:50.580 align:start position:0%
already so really in our present State
 
00:27:51.890 --> 00:27:51.900 align:start position:0%
it's seven people
 
00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:54.900 align:start position:0%
that that this would impact at least in
 
00:27:57.169 --> 00:27:57.179 align:start position:0%
the immediacy OR to say that the the
 
00:27:59.870 --> 00:27:59.880 align:start position:0%
seven positions for when they hire new
 
00:28:01.669 --> 00:28:01.679 align:start position:0%
County administrators in those counties
 
00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:04.200 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't all be converted under
 
00:28:06.649 --> 00:28:06.659 align:start position:0%
this law because it does it at point of
 
00:28:09.769 --> 00:28:09.779 align:start position:0%
higher so right you know that could be
 
00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
years from now they're happy with the
 
00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
folks they have
 
00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:14.570 align:start position:0%
folks they have
yeah

00:28:14.570 --> 00:28:14.580 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:28:16.370 --> 00:28:16.380 align:start position:0%
all right thank you gentlemen very much
 
00:28:19.850 --> 00:28:19.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:21.720 align:start position:0%
was anybody else interested in
 
00:28:27.049 --> 00:28:27.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:31.140 align:start position:0%
if not I will close the hearing on hb30
 
00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
without objection we'll move into
 
00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:38.930 --> 00:28:38.940 align:start position:0%
do I have a motion from the committee
 
00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:41.110 align:start position:0%
do I have a motion from the committee
yes

00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:28:46.549 --> 00:28:46.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:48.289 --> 00:28:48.299 align:start position:0%
ought to pass on House Bill 30.
 
00:28:49.730 --> 00:28:49.740 align:start position:0%
representative Grady motion sought to
 
00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:52.500 align:start position:0%
pass on HP 30 do I have a second second
 
00:28:54.769 --> 00:28:54.779 align:start position:0%
uh representative Ryan seconds
 
00:28:55.850 --> 00:28:55.860 align:start position:0%
um representative Grady would you like
 
00:28:57.710 --> 00:28:57.720 align:start position:0%
to speak to your motion
 
00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
thank you um having heard this bill
 
00:29:03.289 --> 00:29:03.299 align:start position:0%
before and um having
 
00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
um agreed with it in the past and
 
00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:06.830 align:start position:0%
um agreed with it in the past and
putting

00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
putting
 
00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:08.820 align:start position:0%
um counties on parity with
 
00:29:11.390 --> 00:29:11.400 align:start position:0%
municipalities or all reasons why I
 
00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
think this committee should support the
 
00:29:15.669 --> 00:29:15.679 align:start position:0%
auto pass motion
 
00:29:17.810 --> 00:29:17.820 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Brian would you
 
00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:19.740 align:start position:0%
like to speak to your second
 
00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:20.450 align:start position:0%
like to speak to your second
yes

00:29:20.450 --> 00:29:20.460 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:24.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh as you have
 
00:29:26.090 --> 00:29:26.100 align:start position:0%
witnessed I asked some questions I had
 
00:29:30.649 --> 00:29:30.659 align:start position:0%
them all very well answered and my
 
00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
concerns with the uaal seems to be
 
00:29:36.289 --> 00:29:36.299 align:start position:0%
extremely minimal so therefore I don't
 
00:29:39.289 --> 00:29:39.299 align:start position:0%
see this as a major impact and and
 
00:29:41.930 --> 00:29:41.940 align:start position:0%
pretty much keeps the system as we know
 
00:29:45.049 --> 00:29:45.059 align:start position:0%
it in operating so I am going to offer
 
00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:48.120 align:start position:0%
my support but this thank you
 
00:29:49.669 --> 00:29:49.679 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
00:29:51.289 --> 00:29:51.299 align:start position:0%
representative abstractric and then
 
00:29:53.210 --> 00:29:53.220 align:start position:0%
representative true is it appropriate to
 
00:29:56.570 --> 00:29:56.580 align:start position:0%
just uh explain why I support something
 
00:29:59.750 --> 00:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
um what was not mentioned
 
00:30:02.210 --> 00:30:02.220 align:start position:0%
and something which I believe is in the
 
00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:04.260 align:start position:0%
public interest is that this will expand
 
00:30:06.769 --> 00:30:06.779 align:start position:0%
the amount of applicants
 
00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:08.760 align:start position:0%
that the County Commissioners will have
 
00:30:10.850 --> 00:30:10.860 align:start position:0%
to choose from
 
00:30:13.070 --> 00:30:13.080 align:start position:0%
there's a Cadre of city and county
 
00:30:16.669 --> 00:30:16.679 align:start position:0%
managers in the country I'm a member of
 
00:30:18.769 --> 00:30:18.779 align:start position:0%
that organization the international City
 
00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:21.080 align:start position:0%
County Managers Association
 
00:30:25.010 --> 00:30:25.020 align:start position:0%
and uh about half of us stay in the
 
00:30:27.049 --> 00:30:27.059 align:start position:0%
states that were that we start in and
 
00:30:28.789 --> 00:30:28.799 align:start position:0%
we're always in the retirement system
 
00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:31.200 align:start position:0%
but there's another half out there that
 
00:30:33.470 --> 00:30:33.480 align:start position:0%
moves from state to a state kind of like
 
00:30:37.970 --> 00:30:37.980 align:start position:0%
you know Nomads or uh uh I used to I
 
00:30:43.450 --> 00:30:43.460 align:start position:0%
used to think I was a a a a Rowan
 
00:30:47.029 --> 00:30:47.039 align:start position:0%
who wasn't working for a show a Shogun
 
00:30:48.610 --> 00:30:48.620 align:start position:0%
but anyway
 
00:30:53.210 --> 00:30:53.220 align:start position:0%
uh this will allow people who are well
 
00:30:56.810 --> 00:30:56.820 align:start position:0%
some well myself I chose to go from
 
00:30:58.730 --> 00:30:58.740 align:start position:0%
state to state and to be in what's known
 
00:31:00.130 --> 00:31:00.140 align:start position:0%
as the icma
 
00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
retirement corporation which is a 401a
 
00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:03.730 align:start position:0%
retirement corporation which is a 401a
program

00:31:03.730 --> 00:31:03.740 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
and uh I wouldn't have come to I
 
00:31:08.690 --> 00:31:08.700 align:start position:0%
wouldn't even apply to the city of
 
00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:09.830 align:start position:0%
wouldn't even apply to the city of
Rochester

00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
Rochester
 
00:31:13.010 --> 00:31:13.020 align:start position:0%
if if cities weren't allowed to do this
 
00:31:15.409 --> 00:31:15.419 align:start position:0%
because I was like 60 and I was I didn't
 
00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
have time to even start a a brand new uh
 
00:31:24.110 --> 00:31:24.120 align:start position:0%
retirement system so what the the bottom
 
00:31:26.269 --> 00:31:26.279 align:start position:0%
line public benefit
 
00:31:29.210 --> 00:31:29.220 align:start position:0%
is that it will increase the
 
00:31:32.090 --> 00:31:32.100 align:start position:0%
pool of candidates for your county when
 
00:31:34.730 --> 00:31:34.740 align:start position:0%
they're choosing a chief executive
 
00:31:38.210 --> 00:31:38.220 align:start position:0%
officer that's it and that may a larger
 
00:31:40.789 --> 00:31:40.799 align:start position:0%
pool may or may not allow to have a a
 
00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:48.600 align:start position:0%
I'm thank you for this opportunity thank
 
00:31:51.529 --> 00:31:51.539 align:start position:0%
you representative true
 
00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
a question of the chair
 
00:31:57.409 --> 00:31:57.419 align:start position:0%
does is this retroactive or is this only
 
00:31:57.419 --> 00:31:59.570 align:start position:0%
does is this retroactive or is this only
no

00:31:59.570 --> 00:31:59.580 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:32:01.010 --> 00:32:01.020 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm
 
00:32:03.310 --> 00:32:03.320 align:start position:0%
no it's not
 
00:32:06.649 --> 00:32:06.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative
 
00:32:11.690 --> 00:32:11.700 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um I would just sort
 
00:32:14.029 --> 00:32:14.039 align:start position:0%
of echo what representative Fitzpatrick
 
00:32:17.149 --> 00:32:17.159 align:start position:0%
was saying as you've all heard Merrimack
 
00:32:19.909 --> 00:32:19.919 align:start position:0%
County is one of the counties that is
 
00:32:22.970 --> 00:32:22.980 align:start position:0%
currently using this workaround and it's
 
00:32:25.669 --> 00:32:25.679 align:start position:0%
because our commissioners definitely
 
00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
felt that the head of our Corrections at
 
00:32:32.510 --> 00:32:32.520 align:start position:0%
the time was very familiar with the
 
00:32:35.510 --> 00:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
county and its operations and an ideal
 
00:32:39.289 --> 00:32:39.299 align:start position:0%
candidate but he was hesitant to accept
 
00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:42.360 align:start position:0%
the appointment because of jeopardizing
 
00:32:47.090 --> 00:32:47.100 align:start position:0%
his group to pension so it kind of you
 
00:32:49.010 --> 00:32:49.020 align:start position:0%
have to measure you know what's what's
 
00:32:51.130 --> 00:32:51.140 align:start position:0%
best for your county
 
00:32:55.130 --> 00:32:55.140 align:start position:0%
and that he obviously ended up since
 
00:32:58.669 --> 00:32:58.679 align:start position:0%
this the previous Bill did fail he ended
 
00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:01.080 align:start position:0%
up approaching them to find another way
 
00:33:03.230 --> 00:33:03.240 align:start position:0%
and they came up with with the work
 
00:33:07.789 --> 00:33:07.799 align:start position:0%
around so it does in effect limit the
 
00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
ability to hire someone that you feel is
 
00:33:12.889 --> 00:33:12.899 align:start position:0%
ideal for the physician in some cases
 
00:33:16.009 --> 00:33:16.019 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:19.490 --> 00:33:19.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:21.889 --> 00:33:21.899 align:start position:0%
oh representative Schmidt
 
00:33:23.630 --> 00:33:23.640 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman well both
 
00:33:26.230 --> 00:33:26.240 align:start position:0%
Representatives short and representative
 
00:33:29.570 --> 00:33:29.580 align:start position:0%
Fitzpatrick remarks uh lead me to point
 
00:33:31.789 --> 00:33:31.799 align:start position:0%
out that it might not be just a question
 
00:33:34.250 --> 00:33:34.260 align:start position:0%
of expanding the pool but you might have
 
00:33:38.149 --> 00:33:38.159 align:start position:0%
in your own County a specific individual
 
00:33:38.159 --> 00:33:39.350 align:start position:0%
in your own County a specific individual
candidate

00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
candidate
 
00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
available who's outstanding that you
 
00:33:44.149 --> 00:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
want that person and this could be the
 
00:33:46.789 --> 00:33:46.799 align:start position:0%
key to that person being interested in
 
00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
taking the job so it's not just a bigger
 
00:33:52.250 --> 00:33:52.260 align:start position:0%
pool but you could be for a specific
 
00:33:55.070 --> 00:33:55.080 align:start position:0%
individual that you specifically want so
 
00:33:58.130 --> 00:33:58.140 align:start position:0%
this is a kind of a no-lose situation in
 
00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
my opinion thank you thank you
 
00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:06.289 --> 00:34:06.299 align:start position:0%
seeing no one I will ask the clerk to
 
00:34:08.629 --> 00:34:08.639 align:start position:0%

part-time firefighters from the pension
 
00:48:46.430 --> 00:48:46.440 align:start position:0%
system as it relates to teaching
 
00:48:49.370 --> 00:48:49.380 align:start position:0%
opportunities at the fire academy
 
00:48:53.510 --> 00:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
in 2022 there was an ad hoc committee
 
00:48:55.569 --> 00:48:55.579 align:start position:0%
involving fire and EMS retention
 
00:48:58.430 --> 00:48:58.440 align:start position:0%
Recruitment and Retention that did a
 
00:49:01.250 --> 00:49:01.260 align:start position:0%
comprehensive 23-page report talking
 
00:49:04.130 --> 00:49:04.140 align:start position:0%
about the State of Affairs as it relates

state level recommendations 16 local
 
00:49:10.970 --> 00:49:10.980 align:start position:0%
recommendations and three General
 
00:49:13.190 --> 00:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
recommendations that they made in that
 
00:49:16.390 --> 00:49:16.400 align:start position:0%
report two of the recommendations
 
00:49:18.829 --> 00:49:18.839 align:start position:0%
deck caught the prime sponsor's
 
00:49:21.050 --> 00:49:21.060 align:start position:0%
attention representative wolf was
 
00:49:22.790 --> 00:49:22.800 align:start position:0%
recommendation number nine which would
 
00:49:24.230 --> 00:49:24.240 align:start position:0%
be increasing the number of available
 
00:49:25.910 --> 00:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
training opportunities throughout the
 
00:49:28.910 --> 00:49:28.920 align:start position:0%
state thereby increasing the number of
 
00:49:30.829 --> 00:49:30.839 align:start position:0%
trained individuals and reducing travel
 
00:49:33.109 --> 00:49:33.119 align:start position:0%
time for students and then
 
00:49:36.290 --> 00:49:36.300 align:start position:0%
recommendation 21 which amplifies the
 
00:49:38.150 --> 00:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
bill in question today support
 
00:49:39.950 --> 00:49:39.960 align:start position:0%
legislation that would allow the New
 
00:49:42.470 --> 00:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire retirement system retirees to
 
00:49:44.270 --> 00:49:44.280 align:start position:0%
work as on-call firefighters and
 
00:49:45.890 --> 00:49:45.900 align:start position:0%
Emergency Medical Service Providers
 
00:49:48.470 --> 00:49:48.480 align:start position:0%
emergency situations without those hours
 
00:49:50.569 --> 00:49:50.579 align:start position:0%
counting towards the annual hour
 
00:49:53.990 --> 00:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
limitation for time employees and that's
 
00:49:56.450 --> 00:49:56.460 align:start position:0%
what this bill seeks to accomplish it
 
00:49:59.809 --> 00:49:59.819 align:start position:0%
seeks to add retired firefighters to the
 
00:50:02.930 --> 00:50:02.940 align:start position:0%
bill exempting them for their annual
 
00:50:04.730 --> 00:50:04.740 align:start position:0%
hour limitations so they can go to
 
00:50:07.370 --> 00:50:07.380 align:start position:0%
Concord they could go to Bethlehem and
 
00:50:10.130 --> 00:50:10.140 align:start position:0%
actually pass along their years of
 
00:50:12.370 --> 00:50:12.380 align:start position:0%
experience the institutional knowledge
 
00:50:15.589 --> 00:50:15.599 align:start position:0%
that they've Acquired and passing it
 
00:50:17.089 --> 00:50:17.099 align:start position:0%
along to the student the men and women
 
00:50:19.130 --> 00:50:19.140 align:start position:0%
that are choosing a career as First
 
00:50:21.410 --> 00:50:21.420 align:start position:0%
Responders in this state not just the
 
00:50:23.569 --> 00:50:23.579 align:start position:0%
the actual academic component but
 
00:50:24.890 --> 00:50:24.900 align:start position:0%
actually getting you know real life
 
00:50:27.050 --> 00:50:27.060 align:start position:0%
experiences from from some of the men
 
00:50:28.730 --> 00:50:28.740 align:start position:0%
and women right now and those that have
 
00:50:31.430 --> 00:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
retired that are positioned to to talk
 
00:50:33.230 --> 00:50:33.240 align:start position:0%
about their experiences and pastless
 
00:50:36.530 --> 00:50:36.540 align:start position:0%
experiences along to them
 
00:50:38.630 --> 00:50:38.640 align:start position:0%
right now in New Hampshire Recruitment
 
00:50:40.849 --> 00:50:40.859 align:start position:0%
and Retention is a widespread problem
 
00:50:43.370 --> 00:50:43.380 align:start position:0%
especially in some of our our in our
 
00:50:45.890 --> 00:50:45.900 align:start position:0%
rural communities where they rely
 
00:50:48.650 --> 00:50:48.660 align:start position:0%
heavily and volunteer on on-call uh
 
00:50:51.290 --> 00:50:51.300 align:start position:0%
responders it's been very difficult to
 
00:50:53.329 --> 00:50:53.339 align:start position:0%
get those types of individuals to step
 
00:50:55.790 --> 00:50:55.800 align:start position:0%
up in their local community to assist at
 
00:50:58.970 --> 00:50:58.980 align:start position:0%
that particular level the only way that
 
00:51:00.650 --> 00:51:00.660 align:start position:0%
you can increase
 
00:51:03.109 --> 00:51:03.119 align:start position:0%
potentially the level of First
 
00:51:05.089 --> 00:51:05.099 align:start position:0%
Responders in our state is to increase
 
00:51:07.790 --> 00:51:07.800 align:start position:0%
the number of people that that are
 
00:51:10.849 --> 00:51:10.859 align:start position:0%
working at the at the Academy
 
00:51:14.329 --> 00:51:14.339 align:start position:0%
so that's the that's really the the the
 
00:51:17.990 --> 00:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
basic crust of of the bill the one thing
 
00:51:19.790 --> 00:51:19.800 align:start position:0%
that I have handed around for the
 
00:51:19.800 --> 00:51:21.349 align:start position:0%
that I have handed around for the
Committees

00:51:21.349 --> 00:51:21.359 align:start position:0%
Committees
 
00:51:24.530 --> 00:51:24.540 align:start position:0%
um consideration is
 
00:51:26.690 --> 00:51:26.700 align:start position:0%
including the department of police
 
00:51:28.730 --> 00:51:28.740 align:start position:0%
standards and training
 
00:51:30.829 --> 00:51:30.839 align:start position:0%
something that when representative wolf
 
00:51:33.349 --> 00:51:33.359 align:start position:0%
had put his bill together I had
 
00:51:35.510 --> 00:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
suggested that maybe we need to include
 
00:51:39.049 --> 00:51:39.059 align:start position:0%
the police standards division as well as
 
00:51:40.670 --> 00:51:40.680 align:start position:0%
a part as a part of the conversation
 
00:51:43.490 --> 00:51:43.500 align:start position:0%
again with our with with our men in blue
 
00:51:46.370 --> 00:51:46.380 align:start position:0%
putting you know having a lot of
 
00:51:49.010 --> 00:51:49.020 align:start position:0%
experience of working on the streets
 
00:51:51.829 --> 00:51:51.839 align:start position:0%
um not just with you know crime fighting
 
00:51:53.870 --> 00:51:53.880 align:start position:0%
but also the community policing piece
 
00:51:56.329 --> 00:51:56.339 align:start position:0%
which our state takes a lot of pride in
 
00:51:58.670 --> 00:51:58.680 align:start position:0%
doing again it's that kind of acquired
 
00:52:00.770 --> 00:52:00.780 align:start position:0%
knowledge that they can pass on to
 
00:52:03.109 --> 00:52:03.119 align:start position:0%
Future men and women seeking a career in
 
00:52:05.390 --> 00:52:05.400 align:start position:0%
law enforcement again not the academic
 
00:52:07.910 --> 00:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
piece but also learning from people from
 
00:52:09.170 --> 00:52:09.180 align:start position:0%
men and women that have actually been on
 
00:52:10.549 --> 00:52:10.559 align:start position:0%
the streets
 
00:52:12.170 --> 00:52:12.180 align:start position:0%
um working with people and fighting
 
00:52:14.329 --> 00:52:14.339 align:start position:0%
crime so that's the extent of my
 
00:52:14.339 --> 00:52:15.770 align:start position:0%
crime so that's the extent of my
presentation

00:52:15.770 --> 00:52:15.780 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
00:52:17.270 --> 00:52:17.280 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much Madam chair and
 
00:52:18.829 --> 00:52:18.839 align:start position:0%
to the steam colleagues for listening to
 
00:52:20.870 --> 00:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
me and I certainly would Avail myself to
 
00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:22.309 align:start position:0%
me and I certainly would Avail myself to
questions

00:52:22.309 --> 00:52:22.319 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:52:23.990 --> 00:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
00:52:26.809 --> 00:52:26.819 align:start position:0%
representative O'Brien has a question
 
00:52:29.270 --> 00:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh representative
 
00:52:31.790 --> 00:52:31.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question uh
 
00:52:33.530 --> 00:52:33.540 align:start position:0%
representative Boyd are you familiar
 
00:52:35.690 --> 00:52:35.700 align:start position:0%
with actually how many hours that a
 
00:52:37.430 --> 00:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
retired employee
 
00:52:39.309 --> 00:52:39.319 align:start position:0%
can work
 
00:52:44.870 --> 00:52:44.880 align:start position:0%
I apologize 25 hours 25 hours okay uh
 
00:52:47.030 --> 00:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
could not not be handled with an
 
00:52:48.890 --> 00:52:48.900 align:start position:0%
adjustable block as far as the
 
00:52:51.710 --> 00:52:51.720 align:start position:0%
scheduling for some of the training
 
00:52:55.370 --> 00:52:55.380 align:start position:0%
instead of changing a state law
 
00:52:57.049 --> 00:52:57.059 align:start position:0%
so that the short answer to your
 
00:52:59.150 --> 00:52:59.160 align:start position:0%
question is probably yes
 
00:53:01.250 --> 00:53:01.260 align:start position:0%
I don't know the larger any answer to
 
00:53:03.230 --> 00:53:03.240 align:start position:0%
the question representative O'Brien
 
00:53:06.049 --> 00:53:06.059 align:start position:0%
because unlike you I I did not put on
 
00:53:07.970 --> 00:53:07.980 align:start position:0%
the uniform and I know you did so
 
00:53:09.890 --> 00:53:09.900 align:start position:0%
obviously your institutional knowledge
 
00:53:13.069 --> 00:53:13.079 align:start position:0%
probably comes into play as it relates
 
00:53:14.329 --> 00:53:14.339 align:start position:0%
to this and I think your perspective
 
00:53:16.670 --> 00:53:16.680 align:start position:0%
could be valuable in that regard I would
 
00:53:18.890 --> 00:53:18.900 align:start position:0%
love in that job position but I think I
 
00:53:20.990 --> 00:53:21.000 align:start position:0%
feel glad to have a lot of the stuff I
 
00:53:22.910 --> 00:53:22.920 align:start position:0%
learned so thank you it's a fair
 
00:53:24.109 --> 00:53:24.119 align:start position:0%
question I just I don't have an
 
00:53:25.790 --> 00:53:25.800 align:start position:0%
appropriate answer representative thank
 
00:53:27.829 --> 00:53:27.839 align:start position:0%
you thank you
 
00:53:27.839 --> 00:53:29.569 align:start position:0%
you thank you
yep

00:53:29.569 --> 00:53:29.579 align:start position:0%
yep
 
00:53:31.970 --> 00:53:31.980 align:start position:0%
representative goalie and are you
 
00:53:34.130 --> 00:53:34.140 align:start position:0%
gentlemen okay thank you
 
00:53:35.750 --> 00:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
00:53:37.069 --> 00:53:37.079 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:53:37.079 --> 00:53:38.750 align:start position:0%
taking my question
if

00:53:38.750 --> 00:53:38.760 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:53:40.970 --> 00:53:40.980 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm not sure if you're the right
 
00:53:43.430 --> 00:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
person to answer or someone from
 
00:53:45.950 --> 00:53:45.960 align:start position:0%
um The Academy but if there is a
 
00:53:48.410 --> 00:53:48.420 align:start position:0%
staffing issue
 
00:53:50.870 --> 00:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
is it only in part-time employment or
 
00:53:53.510 --> 00:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
should we be if there's truly a staffing
 
00:53:54.710 --> 00:53:54.720 align:start position:0%
issue in getting these programs
 
00:53:57.589 --> 00:53:57.599 align:start position:0%
implemented should we be looking more at
 
00:53:59.690 --> 00:53:59.700 align:start position:0%
hiring full-time employees instead of
 
00:54:01.609 --> 00:54:01.619 align:start position:0%
filling voids with part-time I mean
 
00:54:03.650 --> 00:54:03.660 align:start position:0%
that's I mean that's that's certainly a
 
00:54:06.049 --> 00:54:06.059 align:start position:0%
fair comment representative you know not
 
00:54:09.130 --> 00:54:09.140 align:start position:0%
knowing the actual day-to-day operations
 
00:54:13.630 --> 00:54:13.640 align:start position:0%
of of both the and I'm going to use this
 
00:54:15.770 --> 00:54:15.780 align:start position:0%
colloquially the police academy and the
 
00:54:18.049 --> 00:54:18.059 align:start position:0%
fire academy not knowing what what their
 
00:54:21.530 --> 00:54:21.540 align:start position:0%
day-to-day roles are I think the concern
 
00:54:23.089 --> 00:54:23.099 align:start position:0%
that you raise is certainly certainly a
 
00:54:25.910 --> 00:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
valid one if it is indeed true I just I
 
00:54:27.230 --> 00:54:27.240 align:start position:0%
can't speak to it because I honestly
 
00:54:29.210 --> 00:54:29.220 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
00:54:31.609 --> 00:54:31.619 align:start position:0%
follow-up we do have someone from the
 
00:54:33.890 --> 00:54:33.900 align:start position:0%
police and the fire signed up to speak
 
00:54:36.290 --> 00:54:36.300 align:start position:0%
and I agree they would probably be the
 
00:54:37.730 --> 00:54:37.740 align:start position:0%
best person to answer that kind of
 
00:54:37.740 --> 00:54:39.170 align:start position:0%
best person to answer that kind of
question

00:54:39.170 --> 00:54:39.180 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:54:43.010 --> 00:54:43.020 align:start position:0%
and I just am asking because my concerns
 
00:54:44.770 --> 00:54:44.780 align:start position:0%
are as we talk about
 
00:54:47.690 --> 00:54:47.700 align:start position:0%
retirees filling voids in part-time
 
00:54:50.750 --> 00:54:50.760 align:start position:0%
positions wouldn't you agree we could
 
00:54:52.490 --> 00:54:52.500 align:start position:0%
open up a can of worms here because
 
00:54:53.870 --> 00:54:53.880 align:start position:0%
we've gone from just the fire academy
 
00:54:55.609 --> 00:54:55.619 align:start position:0%
now to the police academy and what's
 
00:54:56.990 --> 00:54:57.000 align:start position:0%
going to be the next group coming in
 
00:54:59.569 --> 00:54:59.579 align:start position:0%
here looking to fill that void and get
 
00:55:01.130 --> 00:55:01.140 align:start position:0%
an exemption from the number of hours
 
00:55:03.530 --> 00:55:03.540 align:start position:0%
worked for this for the retirement
 
00:55:06.349 --> 00:55:06.359 align:start position:0%
system again it's it's a fair concern I
 
00:55:08.510 --> 00:55:08.520 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't dismiss it
 
00:55:10.490 --> 00:55:10.500 align:start position:0%
all right any other questions for the
 
00:55:10.500 --> 00:55:11.630 align:start position:0%
all right any other questions for the
representative

00:55:11.630 --> 00:55:11.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:55:13.430 --> 00:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none thank you very
 
00:55:14.870 --> 00:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
much to the committee and you madam
 
00:55:16.970 --> 00:55:16.980 align:start position:0%
chair thank you very much and I'd like
 
00:55:20.450 --> 00:55:20.460 align:start position:0%
to call Mr Jeffrey Phillips who I
 
00:55:23.329 --> 00:55:23.339 align:start position:0%
believe is with the fire academy
 
00:55:23.339 --> 00:55:31.730 align:start position:0%
believe is with the fire academy
foreign

00:55:31.730 --> 00:55:31.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:34.010 --> 00:55:34.020 align:start position:0%
good morning Madam chair and the rest of
 
00:55:35.510 --> 00:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
the committee I thank you for this
 
00:55:37.130 --> 00:55:37.140 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak to you my name is
 
00:55:38.270 --> 00:55:38.280 align:start position:0%
Jeffrey Phillips I'm the assistant
 
00:55:40.430 --> 00:55:40.440 align:start position:0%
director at the division of fire stands
 
00:55:41.510 --> 00:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
as a training and Emergency Medical
 
00:55:44.950 --> 00:55:44.960 align:start position:0%
Services which operates the fire academy
 
00:55:47.390 --> 00:55:47.400 align:start position:0%
currently right now I've worked for the
 
00:55:49.370 --> 00:55:49.380 align:start position:0%
division for over 20 years and I would
 
00:55:50.990 --> 00:55:51.000 align:start position:0%
say currently right now the demand for
 
00:55:53.089 --> 00:55:53.099 align:start position:0%
training uh firing EMS in the state of
 
00:55:55.010 --> 00:55:55.020 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is as high as it possibly
 
00:55:58.430 --> 00:55:58.440 align:start position:0%
can be as representative
 
00:56:01.430 --> 00:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
um Boyd spoke there was a recruitment
 
00:56:04.250 --> 00:56:04.260 align:start position:0%
and retention committee report and uh
 
00:56:05.630 --> 00:56:05.640 align:start position:0%
study done
 
00:56:07.609 --> 00:56:07.619 align:start position:0%
um and essentially this this is a domino
 
00:56:09.950 --> 00:56:09.960 align:start position:0%
effect for us the locals continue to
 
00:56:12.530 --> 00:56:12.540 align:start position:0%
have struggles getting uh fire and EMS
 
00:56:12.540 --> 00:56:13.849 align:start position:0%
have struggles getting uh fire and EMS
professionals

00:56:13.849 --> 00:56:13.859 align:start position:0%
professionals
 
00:56:17.089 --> 00:56:17.099 align:start position:0%
um which reduces because their uh
 
00:56:19.490 --> 00:56:19.500 align:start position:0%
Staffing is our main source of
 
00:56:21.530 --> 00:56:21.540 align:start position:0%
instructors as of right now to
 
00:56:23.870 --> 00:56:23.880 align:start position:0%
representative goalie we have no
 
00:56:26.210 --> 00:56:26.220 align:start position:0%
full-time uh dedicated instructors that
 
00:56:29.049 --> 00:56:29.059 align:start position:0%
their sole job is to perform education
 
00:56:33.190 --> 00:56:33.200 align:start position:0%
we have 187 part-time uh currently
 
00:56:36.170 --> 00:56:36.180 align:start position:0%
part-time instructors approximately 25
 
00:56:38.809 --> 00:56:38.819 align:start position:0%
percent of those instructors are
 
00:56:42.890 --> 00:56:42.900 align:start position:0%
retirees we rely heavily on these
 
00:56:42.900 --> 00:56:44.930 align:start position:0%
retirees we rely heavily on these
individuals

00:56:44.930 --> 00:56:44.940 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
00:56:48.290 --> 00:56:48.300 align:start position:0%
um one answer that I can't do in regards
 
00:56:50.569 --> 00:56:50.579 align:start position:0%
to representative O'Brien's comment in
 
00:56:53.030 --> 00:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
regards to it's it comes I believe to in
 
00:56:55.130 --> 00:56:55.140 align:start position:0%
like an average of 25 hours a week I
 
00:56:59.390 --> 00:56:59.400 align:start position:0%
think it's like a 1300 hour cap per year
 
00:57:02.329 --> 00:57:02.339 align:start position:0%
um but it used to be per employer right
 
00:57:05.569 --> 00:57:05.579 align:start position:0%
now it's cumulative for all employers so
 
00:57:07.549 --> 00:57:07.559 align:start position:0%
we do not have visibility on the number
 
00:57:09.829 --> 00:57:09.839 align:start position:0%
of hours our retirees work for other
 
00:57:12.410 --> 00:57:12.420 align:start position:0%
agencies but if you have a person that
 
00:57:15.530 --> 00:57:15.540 align:start position:0%
works for the Concord the Goffstown Fire
 
00:57:16.910 --> 00:57:16.920 align:start position:0%
Department or the Bethlehem fire
 
00:57:16.920 --> 00:57:18.049 align:start position:0%
Department or the Bethlehem fire
department

00:57:18.049 --> 00:57:18.059 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:57:21.589 --> 00:57:21.599 align:start position:0%
um their hours are also added to
 
00:57:23.089 --> 00:57:23.099 align:start position:0%
um the ones that they work at the fire
 
00:57:26.030 --> 00:57:26.040 align:start position:0%
academy for teaching we do have several
 
00:57:28.549 --> 00:57:28.559 align:start position:0%
employees that continue to work multiple
 
00:57:31.370 --> 00:57:31.380 align:start position:0%
hours for multiple agencies that were
 
00:57:34.309 --> 00:57:34.319 align:start position:0%
responding on fire and EMS calls and
 
00:57:36.290 --> 00:57:36.300 align:start position:0%
they really are limited in the number of
 
00:57:39.770 --> 00:57:39.780 align:start position:0%
hours that they can work for us in
 
00:57:41.809 --> 00:57:41.819 align:start position:0%
regards to scheduling and representative
 
00:57:44.089 --> 00:57:44.099 align:start position:0%
O'Brien's comment
 
00:57:46.849 --> 00:57:46.859 align:start position:0%
um we try to do uh as creative
 
00:57:50.150 --> 00:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
scheduling as possible to uh be able to
 
00:57:52.430 --> 00:57:52.440 align:start position:0%
perform the trainings that we do however
 
00:57:54.290 --> 00:57:54.300 align:start position:0%
due to the vast majority of the
 
00:57:55.970 --> 00:57:55.980 align:start position:0%
trainings that we do
 
00:57:58.430 --> 00:57:58.440 align:start position:0%
um throughout the state uh we do
 
00:58:00.109 --> 00:58:00.119 align:start position:0%
trainings in Concord we do trainings at
 
00:58:02.150 --> 00:58:02.160 align:start position:0%
Bethlehem but those are actually limited
 
00:58:04.069 --> 00:58:04.079 align:start position:0%
most of our trainings are spread out
 
00:58:05.630 --> 00:58:05.640 align:start position:0%
through through the entire state so
 
00:58:07.609 --> 00:58:07.619 align:start position:0%
we're sending people to co-work to Keene
 
00:58:09.589 --> 00:58:09.599 align:start position:0%
to Portsmouth throughout the entire
 
00:58:12.290 --> 00:58:12.300 align:start position:0%
state to run all of our programs and
 
00:58:14.809 --> 00:58:14.819 align:start position:0%
trying to get these schedules to work
 
00:58:17.569 --> 00:58:17.579 align:start position:0%
with our instructors as but as well at
 
00:58:19.430 --> 00:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
least with our students schedules as
 
00:58:22.970 --> 00:58:22.980 align:start position:0%
well is extremely difficult
 
00:58:24.410 --> 00:58:24.420 align:start position:0%
um as of right now
 
00:58:26.809 --> 00:58:26.819 align:start position:0%
um we Pro we have I think 27 sort of
 
00:58:28.730 --> 00:58:28.740 align:start position:0%
nationally certificate nationally
 
00:58:30.589 --> 00:58:30.599 align:start position:0%
accredited certification programs and
 
00:58:32.030 --> 00:58:32.040 align:start position:0%
hundreds of continuing education
 
00:58:34.309 --> 00:58:34.319 align:start position:0%
programs that we offer we don't have one
 
00:58:35.870 --> 00:58:35.880 align:start position:0%
discipline where we have a sufficient
 
00:58:37.549 --> 00:58:37.559 align:start position:0%
amount of instructors to be able to
 
00:58:39.770 --> 00:58:39.780 align:start position:0%
offer these programs uh to the demand
 
00:58:41.750 --> 00:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
that we have
 
00:58:41.760 --> 00:58:46.809 align:start position:0%
that we have
um

00:58:46.809 --> 00:58:46.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:50.329 --> 00:58:50.339 align:start position:0%
while we don't exactly know the impact
 
00:58:53.950 --> 00:58:53.960 align:start position:0%
of this we know for sure there would be
 
00:58:56.690 --> 00:58:56.700 align:start position:0%
retirees that would be able to teach
 
00:58:59.390 --> 00:58:59.400 align:start position:0%
additional hours for us and at this
 
00:59:01.789 --> 00:59:01.799 align:start position:0%
point right now we're just continuously
 
00:59:03.849 --> 00:59:03.859 align:start position:0%
looking for high quality candidates
 
00:59:08.289 --> 00:59:08.299 align:start position:0%
retirees they have 15 to 20 years of
 
00:59:11.210 --> 00:59:11.220 align:start position:0%
extremely valuable experience for us to
 
00:59:13.250 --> 00:59:13.260 align:start position:0%
be able to tap into and to teach these
 
00:59:15.250 --> 00:59:15.260 align:start position:0%
new men and women come in to fire an EMS
 
00:59:17.630 --> 00:59:17.640 align:start position:0%
and it would be a great resource for us
 
00:59:20.030 --> 00:59:20.040 align:start position:0%
to continue to use
 
00:59:22.609 --> 00:59:22.619 align:start position:0%
can answer any questions
 
00:59:26.210 --> 00:59:26.220 align:start position:0%
thank you are there other questions
 
00:59:28.609 --> 00:59:28.619 align:start position:0%
represent Gould
 
00:59:31.190 --> 00:59:31.200 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair my cousin Vicki
 
00:59:33.530 --> 00:59:33.540 align:start position:0%
Blanchard I spoke to her the other night
 
00:59:35.690 --> 00:59:35.700 align:start position:0%
at from the state you probably know her
 
00:59:38.329 --> 00:59:38.339 align:start position:0%
I know her very well and she and Chris
 
00:59:39.950 --> 00:59:39.960 align:start position:0%
were getting ready to go to Orlando
 
00:59:41.809 --> 00:59:41.819 align:start position:0%
Chris is doing the conference but she
 
00:59:43.430 --> 00:59:43.440 align:start position:0%
assured me that
 
00:59:46.130 --> 00:59:46.140 align:start position:0%
exactly what you said that the need for
 
00:59:47.690 --> 00:59:47.700 align:start position:0%
the retirees the need for the
 
00:59:50.870 --> 00:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
flexibility is very important at the
 
00:59:53.030 --> 00:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
Academy and that she felt this would
 
00:59:54.829 --> 00:59:54.839 align:start position:0%
help a great deal
 
00:59:57.890 --> 00:59:57.900 align:start position:0%
so yep and we would agree I think it
 
01:00:00.010 --> 01:00:00.020 align:start position:0%
definitely would help us I mean
 
01:00:02.990 --> 01:00:03.000 align:start position:0%
we at the fire academy and I won't speak
 
01:00:04.130 --> 01:00:04.140 align:start position:0%
for director skippa at the police
 
01:00:06.230 --> 01:00:06.240 align:start position:0%
academy but um to be able to educate
 
01:00:08.750 --> 01:00:08.760 align:start position:0%
people and fire an EMS uh the experience
 
01:00:11.150 --> 01:00:11.160 align:start position:0%
is the key so we're looking for those
 
01:00:12.890 --> 01:00:12.900 align:start position:0%
men and women that have the experience
 
01:00:15.829 --> 01:00:15.839 align:start position:0%
to be able to bring to us so they can
 
01:00:15.839 --> 01:00:17.270 align:start position:0%
to be able to bring to us so they can
teach

01:00:17.270 --> 01:00:17.280 align:start position:0%
teach
 
01:00:19.849 --> 01:00:19.859 align:start position:0%
um and this is this is just one this is
 
01:00:21.650 --> 01:00:21.660 align:start position:0%
not a solve for our Recruitment and
 
01:00:23.390 --> 01:00:23.400 align:start position:0%
Retention issues at the Academy and
 
01:00:25.370 --> 01:00:25.380 align:start position:0%
stuff like that but it would be a
 
01:00:27.490 --> 01:00:27.500 align:start position:0%
potential help
 
01:00:30.289 --> 01:00:30.299 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions yes represent
 
01:00:30.299 --> 01:00:31.609 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions yes represent
goalie

01:00:31.609 --> 01:00:31.619 align:start position:0%
goalie
 
01:00:33.230 --> 01:00:33.240 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
01:00:35.089 --> 01:00:35.099 align:start position:0%
taking the question
 
01:00:37.549 --> 01:00:37.559 align:start position:0%
he stated that
 
01:00:40.190 --> 01:00:40.200 align:start position:0%
most of the instructors or if not all
 
01:00:41.930 --> 01:00:41.940 align:start position:0%
are part-time
 
01:00:44.809 --> 01:00:44.819 align:start position:0%
I guess my question goes to have you or
 
01:00:44.819 --> 01:00:46.069 align:start position:0%
I guess my question goes to have you or
even

01:00:46.069 --> 01:00:46.079 align:start position:0%
even
 
01:00:48.650 --> 01:00:48.660 align:start position:0%
approached the ability of
 
01:00:51.770 --> 01:00:51.780 align:start position:0%
going to some full-time staff
 
01:00:54.589 --> 01:00:54.599 align:start position:0%
for outreach and for instructing So
 
01:00:56.089 --> 01:00:56.099 align:start position:0%
currently we have had that those
 
01:00:58.430 --> 01:00:58.440 align:start position:0%
conversations internally through the
 
01:01:01.730 --> 01:01:01.740 align:start position:0%
budget process at this time it has been
 
01:01:03.530 --> 01:01:03.540 align:start position:0%
more of a
 
01:01:03.540 --> 01:01:04.609 align:start position:0%
more of a
um

01:01:04.609 --> 01:01:04.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:06.770 --> 01:01:06.780 align:start position:0%
I want to I guess a fight financial
 
01:01:08.630 --> 01:01:08.640 align:start position:0%
decision that we have not gone in that
 
01:01:10.609 --> 01:01:10.619 align:start position:0%
direction uh this current state of the
 
01:01:12.289 --> 01:01:12.299 align:start position:0%
fire and EMS fund
 
01:01:14.930 --> 01:01:14.940 align:start position:0%
um is not performing to the point where
 
01:01:21.170 --> 01:01:21.180 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:23.390 --> 01:01:23.400 align:start position:0%
because that that appears that
 
01:01:25.490 --> 01:01:25.500 align:start position:0%
is an Avenue to go to get some full-time
 
01:01:27.710 --> 01:01:27.720 align:start position:0%
instructors on there and get them into
 
01:01:29.150 --> 01:01:29.160 align:start position:0%
the positions
 
01:01:32.150 --> 01:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
um you know to be continued to keep have
 
01:01:33.770 --> 01:01:33.780 align:start position:0%
some continuity in the programs if you
 
01:01:36.109 --> 01:01:36.119 align:start position:0%
have some on staff instructors that are
 
01:01:37.910 --> 01:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
there all the time nope and I would
 
01:01:41.750 --> 01:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
agree with the representative's comments
 
01:01:44.630 --> 01:01:44.640 align:start position:0%
okay representative O'Brien
 
01:01:48.109 --> 01:01:48.119 align:start position:0%
thank you Chief you mentioned um
 
01:01:51.410 --> 01:01:51.420 align:start position:0%
it's a cumulative effect in this and I
 
01:01:54.470 --> 01:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
don't really understand it because I
 
01:01:57.289 --> 01:01:57.299 align:start position:0%
never been in that type of situation to
 
01:01:59.510 --> 01:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
become familiar but would that not be
 
01:02:01.849 --> 01:02:01.859 align:start position:0%
the fixed if that were to be a limited
 
01:02:04.069 --> 01:02:04.079 align:start position:0%
are you prepared to answer or do you
 
01:02:06.770 --> 01:02:06.780 align:start position:0%
want to refer to uh uh
 
01:02:09.349 --> 01:02:09.359 align:start position:0%
future witness and may bring more better
 
01:02:12.410 --> 01:02:12.420 align:start position:0%
testimony on that because if it goes
 
01:02:14.150 --> 01:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
with the cumulative effect I can see
 
01:02:16.789 --> 01:02:16.799 align:start position:0%
where it compresses at 25 hours you
 
01:02:19.250 --> 01:02:19.260 align:start position:0%
eliminate that that might eliminate your
 
01:02:19.260 --> 01:02:21.250 align:start position:0%
eliminate that that might eliminate your
problem

01:02:21.250 --> 01:02:21.260 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:02:23.630 --> 01:02:23.640 align:start position:0%
that would that would be my
 
01:02:26.089 --> 01:02:26.099 align:start position:0%
understanding so it I'm not sure when
 
01:02:27.950 --> 01:02:27.960 align:start position:0%
the legislation changed at one point it
 
01:02:31.250 --> 01:02:31.260 align:start position:0%
used to be on a per employer basis and
 
01:02:33.230 --> 01:02:33.240 align:start position:0%
then at one point over the I believe the
 
01:02:35.390 --> 01:02:35.400 align:start position:0%
last 10 15 years it had changed to
 
01:02:38.450 --> 01:02:38.460 align:start position:0%
change to a cumulative so all employers
 
01:02:41.710 --> 01:02:41.720 align:start position:0%
were that had to be under the 1300 hours
 
01:02:44.390 --> 01:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
if that cumulative
 
01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:45.770 align:start position:0%
if that cumulative
um

01:02:45.770 --> 01:02:45.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:49.069 --> 01:02:49.079 align:start position:0%
was not the case I would say and it
 
01:02:50.930 --> 01:02:50.940 align:start position:0%
would be accomplishing relatively the
 
01:02:52.370 --> 01:02:52.380 align:start position:0%
same thing that this bill would do
 
01:02:54.109 --> 01:02:54.119 align:start position:0%
because the hours taught for the fire
 
01:02:57.289 --> 01:02:57.299 align:start position:0%
academy would be limited at 25
 
01:02:59.089 --> 01:02:59.099 align:start position:0%
um the Affordable Care Act limits us to
 
01:03:01.549 --> 01:03:01.559 align:start position:0%
29 and a half so I mean from our
 
01:03:03.049 --> 01:03:03.059 align:start position:0%
perspective I believe that would it
 
01:03:10.069 --> 01:03:10.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:13.370 --> 01:03:13.380 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair my question being
 
01:03:16.970 --> 01:03:16.980 align:start position:0%
from a firefighter family is the fire
 
01:03:18.829 --> 01:03:18.839 align:start position:0%
academy can you give us some metrics
 
01:03:22.370 --> 01:03:22.380 align:start position:0%
with regard to is are these firefighters
 
01:03:23.990 --> 01:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
that are coming on to the force that
 
01:03:25.970 --> 01:03:25.980 align:start position:0%
attend the fire academy are the is it
 
01:03:30.170 --> 01:03:30.180 align:start position:0%
renewal training is it annual is it you
 
01:03:30.180 --> 01:03:30.890 align:start position:0%
renewal training is it annual is it you
know

01:03:30.890 --> 01:03:30.900 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:03:33.589 --> 01:03:33.599 align:start position:0%
how many go through there can you give
 
01:03:35.450 --> 01:03:35.460 align:start position:0%
us some metrics yep um so in the state
 
01:03:36.410 --> 01:03:36.420 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire
 
01:03:38.569 --> 01:03:38.579 align:start position:0%
um there for there there's really
 
01:03:41.270 --> 01:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
there's two kind of uh tracks there's a
 
01:03:42.589 --> 01:03:42.599 align:start position:0%
career firefighter which has
 
01:03:44.930 --> 01:03:44.940 align:start position:0%
certification requirements within the
 
01:03:46.430 --> 01:03:46.440 align:start position:0%
first year of their employment they have
 
01:03:47.809 --> 01:03:47.819 align:start position:0%
to go through the initial firefighter
 
01:03:50.390 --> 01:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
one which is about uh just under 200
 
01:03:52.309 --> 01:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
hours in firefighter 2 which is about 70
 
01:03:54.170 --> 01:03:54.180 align:start position:0%
hours they have to have that within
 
01:03:56.270 --> 01:03:56.280 align:start position:0%
their first year of employment and then
 
01:03:59.150 --> 01:03:59.160 align:start position:0%
you have the call volunteer part-time uh
 
01:04:00.650 --> 01:04:00.660 align:start position:0%
staff where there is no legislative
 
01:04:03.770 --> 01:04:03.780 align:start position:0%
requirement of any training however best
 
01:04:05.390 --> 01:04:05.400 align:start position:0%
practices throughout the entire State
 
01:04:08.630 --> 01:04:08.640 align:start position:0%
most Fire Chiefs want to ensure that
 
01:04:11.030 --> 01:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
these folks have the knowledge and
 
01:04:12.650 --> 01:04:12.660 align:start position:0%
training to be able to go into a burning
 
01:04:14.150 --> 01:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
building or deal with motor vehicle
 
01:04:16.069 --> 01:04:16.079 align:start position:0%
accidents propane emergencies Hazmat
 
01:04:18.650 --> 01:04:18.660 align:start position:0%
incidents so they really before they put
 
01:04:20.450 --> 01:04:20.460 align:start position:0%
them into those situations they require
 
01:04:22.970 --> 01:04:22.980 align:start position:0%
them to go through training so it's
 
01:04:24.470 --> 01:04:24.480 align:start position:0%
really been a little bit of both we do
 
01:04:27.049 --> 01:04:27.059 align:start position:0%
have some people that come out of the
 
01:04:28.670 --> 01:04:28.680 align:start position:0%
city of Manchester that's not on a fire
 
01:04:30.829 --> 01:04:30.839 align:start position:0%
department that have no connection to
 
01:04:32.569 --> 01:04:32.579 align:start position:0%
the fire service and go through the
 
01:04:35.089 --> 01:04:35.099 align:start position:0%
training with no experience but I would
 
01:04:36.770 --> 01:04:36.780 align:start position:0%
say the vast majority of our students
 
01:04:39.190 --> 01:04:39.200 align:start position:0%
that go through fire one and fire two
 
01:04:42.309 --> 01:04:42.319 align:start position:0%
are on a small local department
 
01:04:45.349 --> 01:04:45.359 align:start position:0%
and they're really kind of waiting to
 
01:04:46.910 --> 01:04:46.920 align:start position:0%
get to training to be a full member of
 
01:04:47.950 --> 01:04:47.960 align:start position:0%
the department
 
01:04:53.150 --> 01:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
for those numbers we do about 200 to 250
 
01:04:55.549 --> 01:04:55.559 align:start position:0%
fire one of fires two students but
 
01:04:57.470 --> 01:04:57.480 align:start position:0%
that's just one program that we offer we
 
01:05:00.289 --> 01:05:00.299 align:start position:0%
have like I said we have multiple other
 
01:05:02.630 --> 01:05:02.640 align:start position:0%
certification programs that we offer
 
01:05:06.589 --> 01:05:06.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:08.750 --> 01:05:08.760 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:10.309 align:start position:0%
other questions
um

01:05:10.309 --> 01:05:10.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:13.549 --> 01:05:13.559 align:start position:0%
well oh yes representative Schmidt thank
 
01:05:15.530 --> 01:05:15.540 align:start position:0%
you you're speaking yourself
 
01:05:18.049 --> 01:05:18.059 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so did I
 
01:05:19.730 --> 01:05:19.740 align:start position:0%
understand you correctly that there is
 
01:05:23.390 --> 01:05:23.400 align:start position:0%
no State statutory requirement for
 
01:05:25.730 --> 01:05:25.740 align:start position:0%
you said call Firefighters that's the
 
01:05:29.890 --> 01:05:29.900 align:start position:0%
same as a volunteer you are correct
 
01:05:34.849 --> 01:05:34.859 align:start position:0%
is it yeah uh local control
 
01:05:39.530 --> 01:05:39.540 align:start position:0%
is that is that responsible on the
 
01:05:43.069 --> 01:05:43.079 align:start position:0%
state's part to let somebody go into a
 
01:05:43.079 --> 01:05:44.150 align:start position:0%
state's part to let somebody go into a
situation

01:05:44.150 --> 01:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
situation
 
01:05:46.970 --> 01:05:46.980 align:start position:0%
with no training
 
01:05:49.490 --> 01:05:49.500 align:start position:0%
um there's no State mandate um I will
 
01:05:51.530 --> 01:05:51.540 align:start position:0%
say best practice uh if you talk to
 
01:05:53.750 --> 01:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
probably any fires uh Chief in the state
 
01:05:56.690 --> 01:05:56.700 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire is those individuals
 
01:05:59.450 --> 01:05:59.460 align:start position:0%
that have not had the training are
 
01:06:01.250 --> 01:06:01.260 align:start position:0%
limited in regards to what they can do
 
01:06:03.589 --> 01:06:03.599 align:start position:0%
most of them are support roles that you
 
01:06:04.789 --> 01:06:04.799 align:start position:0%
know I mean they could pick up a ladder
 
01:06:07.010 --> 01:06:07.020 align:start position:0%
move a ladder but they would probably
 
01:06:10.730 --> 01:06:10.740 align:start position:0%
not be put in a hazardous environment on
 
01:06:13.910 --> 01:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
a kind of a global level
 
01:06:17.390 --> 01:06:17.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:19.430 --> 01:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
anyone else here
 
01:06:23.030 --> 01:06:23.040 align:start position:0%
I had a question it
 
01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:24.589 align:start position:0%
I had a question it
if you're

01:06:24.589 --> 01:06:24.599 align:start position:0%
if you're
 
01:06:27.770 --> 01:06:27.780 align:start position:0%
hiring part-time people isn't the main
 
01:06:31.370 --> 01:06:31.380 align:start position:0%
difference in budget the fact that you
 
01:06:34.309 --> 01:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
don't have to contribute to the uh
 
01:06:36.650 --> 01:06:36.660 align:start position:0%
retirement system for those people
 
01:06:38.510 --> 01:06:38.520 align:start position:0%
uh the two main differences would be the
 
01:06:40.069 --> 01:06:40.079 align:start position:0%
retirement system contribution the
 
01:06:42.589 --> 01:06:42.599 align:start position:0%
health insurance contribution
 
01:06:45.710 --> 01:06:45.720 align:start position:0%
thank you very much yep all right anyone
 
01:06:45.720 --> 01:06:46.970 align:start position:0%
thank you very much yep all right anyone
else

01:06:46.970 --> 01:06:46.980 align:start position:0%
else
 
01:06:49.430 --> 01:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you
 
01:07:01.430 --> 01:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:03.770 --> 01:07:03.780 align:start position:0%
good morning Madam chair good morning uh
 
01:07:05.990 --> 01:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
honorable members of the committee uh my
 
01:07:08.210 --> 01:07:08.220 align:start position:0%
name is John skippa I'm the director of
 
01:07:09.589 --> 01:07:09.599 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire police standards and
 
01:07:12.829 --> 01:07:12.839 align:start position:0%
training and I appreciate your time
 
01:07:16.370 --> 01:07:16.380 align:start position:0%
today uh to allow me to speak uh I was
 
01:07:19.010 --> 01:07:19.020 align:start position:0%
actually contacted by director Justin
 
01:07:22.430 --> 01:07:22.440 align:start position:0%
cutting who's uh my my peer at the fire
 
01:07:25.250 --> 01:07:25.260 align:start position:0%
academy uh just to pass along that this
 
01:07:27.130 --> 01:07:27.140 align:start position:0%
bill was being
 
01:07:30.730 --> 01:07:30.740 align:start position:0%
introduced and and uh suggested that uh
 
01:07:35.390 --> 01:07:35.400 align:start position:0%
we might have uh some interest in seeing
 
01:07:40.430 --> 01:07:40.440 align:start position:0%
this move forward uh to that end uh much
 
01:07:43.250 --> 01:07:43.260 align:start position:0%
like uh assistant director who just
 
01:07:46.970 --> 01:07:46.980 align:start position:0%
spoke uh at the on the police side of
 
01:07:49.430 --> 01:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
things we're experiencing the same kind
 
01:07:54.049 --> 01:07:54.059 align:start position:0%
of uh training issues uh
 
01:07:56.569 --> 01:07:56.579 align:start position:0%
there are some differences between our
 
01:07:58.370 --> 01:07:58.380 align:start position:0%
two organizations between the fire
 
01:08:00.789 --> 01:08:00.799 align:start position:0%
academy and the police academy
 
01:08:03.770 --> 01:08:03.780 align:start position:0%
presently the police centers and
 
01:08:06.170 --> 01:08:06.180 align:start position:0%
training council is responsible for
 
01:08:09.650 --> 01:08:09.660 align:start position:0%
certifying and training every single law
 
01:08:11.569 --> 01:08:11.579 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer in the state of New
 
01:08:15.230 --> 01:08:15.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire which is uh somewhat different
 
01:08:18.110 --> 01:08:18.120 align:start position:0%
than uh the the fire side of the house
 
01:08:21.769 --> 01:08:21.779 align:start position:0%
where there is a volunteer track
 
01:08:25.910 --> 01:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
not only do we uh represent the sole
 
01:08:28.130 --> 01:08:28.140 align:start position:0%
source of recruit training for every one
 
01:08:31.249 --> 01:08:31.259 align:start position:0%
of those officers but we are also the
 
01:08:33.890 --> 01:08:33.900 align:start position:0%
primary uh trainer for in-service
 
01:08:36.769 --> 01:08:36.779 align:start position:0%
programs uh in-service training hours
 
01:08:41.050 --> 01:08:41.060 align:start position:0%
are required as part of
 
01:08:43.970 --> 01:08:43.980 align:start position:0%
the officers being able to maintain
 
01:08:46.249 --> 01:08:46.259 align:start position:0%
their certification or license to work
 
01:08:46.259 --> 01:08:48.289 align:start position:0%
their certification or license to work
annually

01:08:48.289 --> 01:08:48.299 align:start position:0%
annually
 
01:08:48.299 --> 01:08:50.209 align:start position:0%
annually
uh

01:08:50.209 --> 01:08:50.219 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:08:52.849 --> 01:08:52.859 align:start position:0%
we are looking anecdotally at about a 20
 
01:08:56.809 --> 01:08:56.819 align:start position:0%
percent reduction in uh or a 20 vacancy
 
01:08:59.450 --> 01:08:59.460 align:start position:0%
rate if you will anecdotally across the
 
01:09:01.010 --> 01:09:01.020 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire with regard to
 
01:09:03.950 --> 01:09:03.960 align:start position:0%
law enforcement positions you can look
 
01:09:07.010 --> 01:09:07.020 align:start position:0%
at the newspaper or the news and see
 
01:09:09.289 --> 01:09:09.299 align:start position:0%
this uh is not just a problem here in
 
01:09:10.789 --> 01:09:10.799 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire but it is a problem
 
01:09:10.799 --> 01:09:12.370 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire but it is a problem
Nationwide

01:09:12.370 --> 01:09:12.380 align:start position:0%
Nationwide
 
01:09:16.309 --> 01:09:16.319 align:start position:0%
as a law enforcement leader and speaking
 
01:09:18.289 --> 01:09:18.299 align:start position:0%
with my fellow
 
01:09:22.490 --> 01:09:22.500 align:start position:0%
leaders we don't know if there is uh if
 
01:09:24.289 --> 01:09:24.299 align:start position:0%
this is an anomaly that we're just kind
 
01:09:26.030 --> 01:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
of seeing or whether this is going to be
 
01:09:28.749 --> 01:09:28.759 align:start position:0%
a long trending issue
 
01:09:31.430 --> 01:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
to that end police standards and
 
01:09:33.709 --> 01:09:33.719 align:start position:0%
training is responsible for over 4 000
 
01:09:35.510 --> 01:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
certified officers
 
01:09:42.130 --> 01:09:42.140 align:start position:0%
as of this year 2023 we have also been
 
01:09:45.590 --> 01:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
given new challenges to meet these
 
01:09:48.110 --> 01:09:48.120 align:start position:0%
challenges came from uh recommendations
 
01:09:50.809 --> 01:09:50.819 align:start position:0%
set forth by the liac commission and put
 
01:09:55.010 --> 01:09:55.020 align:start position:0%
into play by the governor's executive
 
01:09:55.020 --> 01:09:56.410 align:start position:0%
into play by the governor's executive
order

01:09:56.410 --> 01:09:56.420 align:start position:0%
order
 
01:10:00.050 --> 01:10:00.060 align:start position:0%
and that increased the amount of
 
01:10:01.970 --> 01:10:01.980 align:start position:0%
training that we had to provide at a
 
01:10:04.490 --> 01:10:04.500 align:start position:0%
recruit level and it has also increased
 
01:10:07.270 --> 01:10:07.280 align:start position:0%
the mandatory in-service training hours
 
01:10:10.610 --> 01:10:10.620 align:start position:0%
for in-service officers from eight hours
 
01:10:13.610 --> 01:10:13.620 align:start position:0%
up to 24 hours
 
01:10:15.650 --> 01:10:15.660 align:start position:0%
and that will be instituted over a
 
01:10:17.450 --> 01:10:17.460 align:start position:0%
three-year period of time and we're in
 
01:10:20.630 --> 01:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
our first year now moving that forward
 
01:10:23.209 --> 01:10:23.219 align:start position:0%
on top of that uh New Hampshire police
 
01:10:25.729 --> 01:10:25.739 align:start position:0%
standards and training now has the
 
01:10:28.610 --> 01:10:28.620 align:start position:0%
conduct Review Committee uh that is
 
01:10:31.729 --> 01:10:31.739 align:start position:0%
responsible for uh reviewing and
 
01:10:34.970 --> 01:10:34.980 align:start position:0%
investigating any uh allegation of
 
01:10:37.250 --> 01:10:37.260 align:start position:0%
police misconduct which is a brand new
 
01:10:39.350 --> 01:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
challenge that police standards and
 
01:10:42.530 --> 01:10:42.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:45.110 --> 01:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
with that particular responsibility it
 
01:10:48.649 --> 01:10:48.659 align:start position:0%
is imperative that we're able to retain
 
01:10:52.370 --> 01:10:52.380 align:start position:0%
some folks that have a tremendous amount
 
01:10:53.930 --> 01:10:53.940 align:start position:0%
of experience in New Hampshire law
 
01:10:57.410 --> 01:10:57.420 align:start position:0%
enforcement that have held rank that
 
01:10:58.910 --> 01:10:58.920 align:start position:0%
have been in the business for a long
 
01:11:01.970 --> 01:11:01.980 align:start position:0%
time have level heads and can understand
 
01:11:05.689 --> 01:11:05.699 align:start position:0%
the nuances of investigating uh police
 
01:11:05.699 --> 01:11:07.270 align:start position:0%
the nuances of investigating uh police
officers

01:11:07.270 --> 01:11:07.280 align:start position:0%
officers
 
01:11:12.010 --> 01:11:12.020 align:start position:0%
we can't find that kind of talent
 
01:11:15.110 --> 01:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
in a full-time capacity unless we try to
 
01:11:16.790 --> 01:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
hire people who are coming from other
 
01:11:19.250 --> 01:11:19.260 align:start position:0%
states and it would be really nice to be
 
01:11:22.189 --> 01:11:22.199 align:start position:0%
able to retain New Hampshire police
 
01:11:24.830 --> 01:11:24.840 align:start position:0%
Executives to take on not only the the
 
01:11:27.169 --> 01:11:27.179 align:start position:0%
conduct review role but really pass
 
01:11:29.870 --> 01:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
along their knowledge that they have
 
01:11:33.290 --> 01:11:33.300 align:start position:0%
acquired over their career and for all
 
01:11:36.110 --> 01:11:36.120 align:start position:0%
of those reasons
 
01:11:39.350 --> 01:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
we would really ask that if this if this
 
01:11:41.149 --> 01:11:41.159 align:start position:0%
bill were to go forward for further
 
01:11:44.330 --> 01:11:44.340 align:start position:0%
consideration that uh full-time police
 
01:11:47.030 --> 01:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
officers working hours at the police
 
01:11:49.490 --> 01:11:49.500 align:start position:0%
academy would be included or amended to
 
01:11:50.570 --> 01:11:50.580 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:11:55.250 --> 01:11:55.260 align:start position:0%
uh anecdotally uh we have 12 full-time
 
01:11:57.890 --> 01:11:57.900 align:start position:0%
trainers and we have three part-time
 
01:12:02.350 --> 01:12:02.360 align:start position:0%
trainers to handle uh the the
 
01:12:04.790 --> 01:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
responsibilities that that our agency
 
01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:05.990 align:start position:0%
responsibilities that that our agency
oversees

01:12:05.990 --> 01:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
oversees
 
01:12:07.970 --> 01:12:07.980 align:start position:0%
I I thank you for your time and I stand
 
01:12:10.070 --> 01:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
ready for any questions
 
01:12:12.110 --> 01:12:12.120 align:start position:0%
thank you are there questions
 
01:12:15.050 --> 01:12:15.060 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt
 
01:12:17.630 --> 01:12:17.640 align:start position:0%
thank you ma'am Cher thank you for being
 
01:12:19.850 --> 01:12:19.860 align:start position:0%
here sir uh could you spell your last
 
01:12:22.370 --> 01:12:22.380 align:start position:0%
name uh I I didn't quite catch it oh
 
01:12:25.689 --> 01:12:25.699 align:start position:0%
absolutely uh it is
 
01:12:29.050 --> 01:12:29.060 align:start position:0%
s-c-i-p-p-a oh no ER
 
01:12:31.910 --> 01:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
much like uh all right we all want to
 
01:12:34.750 --> 01:12:34.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:36.830 --> 01:12:36.840 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
01:12:39.350 --> 01:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
representative O'Brien thank you madam
 
01:12:42.770 --> 01:12:42.780 align:start position:0%
chair if you'll indulge me just to uh
 
01:12:46.669 --> 01:12:46.679 align:start position:0%
uh some write in my notes you stated how
 
01:12:49.189 --> 01:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
many full-time and how many part-time I
 
01:12:51.410 --> 01:12:51.420 align:start position:0%
I just would like those numbers reviewed
 
01:12:54.290 --> 01:12:54.300 align:start position:0%
the uh training specialist yes yes so we
 
01:12:56.689 --> 01:12:56.699 align:start position:0%
we presently have uh 12 full-time
 
01:12:59.390 --> 01:12:59.400 align:start position:0%
training specialists and we have three
 
01:13:04.370 --> 01:13:04.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:06.490 --> 01:13:06.500 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:13:08.990 --> 01:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
comparatively you know I don't want a
 
01:13:11.330 --> 01:13:11.340 align:start position:0%
cat and dog issue you know with the
 
01:13:13.010 --> 01:13:13.020 align:start position:0%
police and fire I understand I've lived
 
01:13:16.250 --> 01:13:16.260 align:start position:0%
it for 35 years but the thing is
 
01:13:19.010 --> 01:13:19.020 align:start position:0%
uh but the thing is is it equal to the
 
01:13:21.370 --> 01:13:21.380 align:start position:0%
fire academy or do you have more
 
01:13:24.229 --> 01:13:24.239 align:start position:0%
full-time capabilities
 
01:13:27.709 --> 01:13:27.719 align:start position:0%
so it's uh and I uh it's a wonderful
 
01:13:30.350 --> 01:13:30.360 align:start position:0%
question sir and I I uh absolutely share
 
01:13:33.649 --> 01:13:33.659 align:start position:0%
uh your your position on this uh Justin
 
01:13:36.890 --> 01:13:36.900 align:start position:0%
cutting my my uh compatriot over at the
 
01:13:38.810 --> 01:13:38.820 align:start position:0%
fire academy and I we enjoy a tremendous
 
01:13:40.910 --> 01:13:40.920 align:start position:0%
relationship but we do work uh very well
 
01:13:43.910 --> 01:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
together and it's it's really an apple
 
01:13:46.330 --> 01:13:46.340 align:start position:0%
and an orange because the the fire
 
01:13:51.189 --> 01:13:51.199 align:start position:0%
academy and EMS academy uh they they
 
01:13:54.530 --> 01:13:54.540 align:start position:0%
really uh as as the assistant director
 
01:13:56.450 --> 01:13:56.460 align:start position:0%
spoke to there's two different tracks
 
01:13:59.930 --> 01:13:59.940 align:start position:0%
for the fire service and uh I you know
 
01:14:01.790 --> 01:14:01.800 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna speak out of school here I
 
01:14:03.110 --> 01:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
know the assistant director could speak
 
01:14:04.790 --> 01:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
more clearly in this but there's there's
 
01:14:06.709 --> 01:14:06.719 align:start position:0%
much more in the way of volunteer
 
01:14:09.530 --> 01:14:09.540 align:start position:0%
firefighters and EMS providers uh than
 
01:14:11.390 --> 01:14:11.400 align:start position:0%
there are there's no such thing as a
 
01:14:13.669 --> 01:14:13.679 align:start position:0%
volunteer police officer they have to
 
01:14:17.030 --> 01:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
have a certification to do that
 
01:14:20.090 --> 01:14:20.100 align:start position:0%
um we you know we certainly
 
01:14:21.709 --> 01:14:21.719 align:start position:0%
um I I
 
01:14:25.250 --> 01:14:25.260 align:start position:0%
I I think that uh from our perspective
 
01:14:26.689 --> 01:14:26.699 align:start position:0%
and it's it's important one of the
 
01:14:28.310 --> 01:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
recommendations that came forward and
 
01:14:30.410 --> 01:14:30.420 align:start position:0%
that we're introducing is to introduce a
 
01:14:33.130 --> 01:14:33.140 align:start position:0%
whole lot more scenario Based training
 
01:14:35.390 --> 01:14:35.400 align:start position:0%
scenario-based training is the best way
 
01:14:39.830 --> 01:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
to teach adults uh particularly uh to
 
01:14:41.990 --> 01:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
respond to Dynamic situations you need a
 
01:14:43.610 --> 01:14:43.620 align:start position:0%
lot of instructors for that you need
 
01:14:46.370 --> 01:14:46.380 align:start position:0%
actors you need evaluators you need
 
01:14:49.189 --> 01:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
safety officers uh to over just to
 
01:14:50.510 --> 01:14:50.520 align:start position:0%
oversee it make sure that we don't
 
01:14:52.310 --> 01:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
introduce a live weapon or have an
 
01:14:55.430 --> 01:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
injury these are very Dynamic situations
 
01:14:55.440 --> 01:14:56.689 align:start position:0%
injury these are very Dynamic situations
sometimes

01:14:56.689 --> 01:14:56.699 align:start position:0%
sometimes
 
01:15:00.410 --> 01:15:00.420 align:start position:0%
so just the number of uh instructors the
 
01:15:03.410 --> 01:15:03.420 align:start position:0%
the amount of help we need to create a
 
01:15:07.189 --> 01:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
meaningful scenario training event uh is
 
01:15:09.709 --> 01:15:09.719 align:start position:0%
is pretty significant but we don't need
 
01:15:12.050 --> 01:15:12.060 align:start position:0%
those people all the time we just need
 
01:15:13.850 --> 01:15:13.860 align:start position:0%
them when we're doing the scenario
 
01:15:17.810 --> 01:15:17.820 align:start position:0%
training we run four full-time academies
 
01:15:21.410 --> 01:15:21.420 align:start position:0%
a year we run uh two Corrections
 
01:15:24.350 --> 01:15:24.360 align:start position:0%
academies a year and we run one to two
 
01:15:26.930 --> 01:15:26.940 align:start position:0%
part-time police academies a year so we
 
01:15:29.930 --> 01:15:29.940 align:start position:0%
we are constantly uh moving people
 
01:15:31.970 --> 01:15:31.980 align:start position:0%
through that facility for those
 
01:15:33.590 --> 01:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
different levels of training and I don't
 
01:15:36.229 --> 01:15:36.239 align:start position:0%
know if that that is uh responding to
 
01:15:38.510 --> 01:15:38.520 align:start position:0%
your question no you didn't thank you
 
01:15:40.370 --> 01:15:40.380 align:start position:0%
very much for your reply thank you sir
 
01:15:42.649 --> 01:15:42.659 align:start position:0%
okay representative gerhardt
 
01:15:44.810 --> 01:15:44.820 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you taking
 
01:15:47.689 --> 01:15:47.699 align:start position:0%
my question the 20 vacancy was that
 
01:15:51.110 --> 01:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
correct that anecdotally yes yeah so the
 
01:15:52.790 --> 01:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
main reason would be physical fitness
 
01:15:54.110 --> 01:15:54.120 align:start position:0%
issues I remember reading about the
 
01:15:55.189 --> 01:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections had issues
 
01:15:56.270 --> 01:15:56.280 align:start position:0%
they wanted to lower the physical
 
01:15:57.950 --> 01:15:57.960 align:start position:0%
standards is that part of the issue
 
01:16:00.350 --> 01:16:00.360 align:start position:0%
what's going on
 
01:16:02.689 --> 01:16:02.699 align:start position:0%
so I I this is a wonderful question and
 
01:16:05.149 --> 01:16:05.159 align:start position:0%
I think it speaks more broadly right in
 
01:16:08.090 --> 01:16:08.100 align:start position:0%
our country right now but um there's a
 
01:16:10.790 --> 01:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
lot of people who uh considered entering
 
01:16:13.370 --> 01:16:13.380 align:start position:0%
law enforcement as a profession and and
 
01:16:15.830 --> 01:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
simply because of
 
01:16:17.689 --> 01:16:17.699 align:start position:0%
um the landscape right now I think
 
01:16:20.810 --> 01:16:20.820 align:start position:0%
there's just a lot of people who are uh
 
01:16:23.689 --> 01:16:23.699 align:start position:0%
looking to other other directions I
 
01:16:27.050 --> 01:16:27.060 align:start position:0%
think on top of that uh we are seeing a
 
01:16:30.470 --> 01:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
lot of uh not a lot but we are seeing a
 
01:16:32.930 --> 01:16:32.940 align:start position:0%
consistent number of New Hampshire law
 
01:16:34.910 --> 01:16:34.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement officers that may have five
 
01:16:37.430 --> 01:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
or ten years into the business and
 
01:16:38.689 --> 01:16:38.699 align:start position:0%
they're stepping away to go to the
 
01:16:40.729 --> 01:16:40.739 align:start position:0%
private sector again for those same
 
01:16:43.310 --> 01:16:43.320 align:start position:0%
reasons it's it has just gotten uh
 
01:16:45.729 --> 01:16:45.739 align:start position:0%
dramatically more
 
01:16:50.470 --> 01:16:50.480 align:start position:0%
dangerous uh there is a lot less I think
 
01:16:54.610 --> 01:16:54.620 align:start position:0%
a feeling of support by uh
 
01:16:57.110 --> 01:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
communities and and Society in general
 
01:17:01.189 --> 01:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
and and uh it really is uh I've been at
 
01:17:03.830 --> 01:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
this for almost 40 years and I've never
 
01:17:07.189 --> 01:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
seen it this way before
 
01:17:08.689 --> 01:17:08.699 align:start position:0%
it's an interesting question thank you
 
01:17:11.030 --> 01:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
sir I hope I answered it yeah follow up
 
01:17:13.550 --> 01:17:13.560 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair appreciate it just
 
01:17:16.010 --> 01:17:16.020 align:start position:0%
side related note would there I know you
 
01:17:17.930 --> 01:17:17.940 align:start position:0%
kind of does it doesn't seem very
 
01:17:19.910 --> 01:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
popular but would there be an
 
01:17:22.490 --> 01:17:22.500 align:start position:0%
a possibility for some sort of auxiliary
 
01:17:24.290 --> 01:17:24.300 align:start position:0%
police force only to encourage more
 
01:17:27.110 --> 01:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
people to participate in said occupation
 
01:17:28.970 --> 01:17:28.980 align:start position:0%
to I know there was some that there's
 
01:17:30.169 --> 01:17:30.179 align:start position:0%
some desire it's kind of unrelated but
 
01:17:31.850 --> 01:17:31.860 align:start position:0%
some desire to have social workers go
 
01:17:34.130 --> 01:17:34.140 align:start position:0%
out and so forth is that being thought
 
01:17:35.810 --> 01:17:35.820 align:start position:0%
of or I mean we could take this off I
 
01:17:37.189 --> 01:17:37.199 align:start position:0%
don't want to get this yet I'd be happy
 
01:17:38.990 --> 01:17:39.000 align:start position:0%
to talk with you offline but just just
 
01:17:41.870 --> 01:17:41.880 align:start position:0%
to give you uh an idea we do run a
 
01:17:45.229 --> 01:17:45.239 align:start position:0%
part-time police academy and uh you know
 
01:17:47.149 --> 01:17:47.159 align:start position:0%
there's certain parts of our state that
 
01:17:49.250 --> 01:17:49.260 align:start position:0%
really rely on that auxiliary that's
 
01:17:51.110 --> 01:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
really what the part-time program is
 
01:17:55.130 --> 01:17:55.140 align:start position:0%
supposed to address uh we just ran an
 
01:17:59.570 --> 01:17:59.580 align:start position:0%
Academy with 10 people we just we we uh
 
01:18:01.250 --> 01:18:01.260 align:start position:0%
particularly part-time It's just tough
 
01:18:02.930 --> 01:18:02.940 align:start position:0%
to generate those numbers the full-time
 
01:18:05.450 --> 01:18:05.460 align:start position:0%
Academy I have a waiting list uh
 
01:18:05.460 --> 01:18:06.830 align:start position:0%
Academy I have a waiting list uh
part-time

01:18:06.830 --> 01:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
part-time
 
01:18:09.110 --> 01:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
um you know people who have other jobs
 
01:18:11.149 --> 01:18:11.159 align:start position:0%
they're really very tentative about
 
01:18:13.910 --> 01:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
jumping into to do this part-time and
 
01:18:16.010 --> 01:18:16.020 align:start position:0%
I'd love to talk with you more about
 
01:18:17.990 --> 01:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
um the social worker aspect we can talk
 
01:18:19.910 --> 01:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
offline and we look forward to that
 
01:18:21.229 --> 01:18:21.239 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much thank you
 
01:18:25.729 --> 01:18:25.739 align:start position:0%
other questions representative uh gold
 
01:18:27.649 --> 01:18:27.659 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:18:30.290 --> 01:18:30.300 align:start position:0%
hi and thank you for taking my question
 
01:18:33.110 --> 01:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
uh I heard you talk about touch on
 
01:18:36.470 --> 01:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
specialty areas that you have specialty
 
01:18:39.050 --> 01:18:39.060 align:start position:0%
areas of training and the ones I'm most
 
01:18:41.390 --> 01:18:41.400 align:start position:0%
familiar with are from family members
 
01:18:43.310 --> 01:18:43.320 align:start position:0%
involved in the field and also for my
 
01:18:43.320 --> 01:18:44.570 align:start position:0%
involved in the field and also for my
constituents

01:18:44.570 --> 01:18:44.580 align:start position:0%
constituents
 
01:18:50.030 --> 01:18:50.040 align:start position:0%
is that um PTSD that our First
 
01:18:53.990 --> 01:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
Responders and police and that in our
 
01:18:58.250 --> 01:18:58.260 align:start position:0%
district 80 percent of the calls are for
 
01:19:01.189 --> 01:19:01.199 align:start position:0%
mental health issues and domestic
 
01:19:01.199 --> 01:19:02.390 align:start position:0%
mental health issues and domestic
violence

01:19:02.390 --> 01:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
violence
 
01:19:04.070 --> 01:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:19:05.810 --> 01:19:05.820 align:start position:0%
um I'm assuming that part of the
 
01:19:08.510 --> 01:19:08.520 align:start position:0%
specialty training that you need to be
 
01:19:11.030 --> 01:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
have the freedom to bring specialists in
 
01:19:13.550 --> 01:19:13.560 align:start position:0%
for have to do with those issues those
 
01:19:17.450 --> 01:19:17.460 align:start position:0%
very unique PTSD and mental health and
 
01:19:19.250 --> 01:19:19.260 align:start position:0%
how to respond appropriately to mental
 
01:19:21.470 --> 01:19:21.480 align:start position:0%
health issues in the community
 
01:19:24.229 --> 01:19:24.239 align:start position:0%
well thank you very much uh for that
 
01:19:26.810 --> 01:19:26.820 align:start position:0%
question absolutely as a matter of fact
 
01:19:30.169 --> 01:19:30.179 align:start position:0%
with regard to police officers uh
 
01:19:33.229 --> 01:19:33.239 align:start position:0%
responding to folks who are having a
 
01:19:35.330 --> 01:19:35.340 align:start position:0%
mental health crisis we engage with New
 
01:19:38.750 --> 01:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Nami uh to teach all of that
 
01:19:40.189 --> 01:19:40.199 align:start position:0%
program just because they're subject
 
01:19:44.270 --> 01:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
matter experts we do bring in uh peer
 
01:19:48.470 --> 01:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
support police officers uh and and a lot
 
01:19:50.030 --> 01:19:50.040 align:start position:0%
of instruction right now that occurs at
 
01:19:52.669 --> 01:19:52.679 align:start position:0%
the Academy is volunteer uh when we have
 
01:19:54.709 --> 01:19:54.719 align:start position:0%
outside police instructors that come in
 
01:19:59.510 --> 01:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
they they are coming here to help uh
 
01:20:01.550 --> 01:20:01.560 align:start position:0%
that has always been the model at the
 
01:20:03.350 --> 01:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Police Academy was to rely
 
01:20:07.430 --> 01:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
on volunteers uh we do bring peer
 
01:20:09.530 --> 01:20:09.540 align:start position:0%
support police officers and to teach the
 
01:20:13.850 --> 01:20:13.860 align:start position:0%
PTSD portion and uh
 
01:20:16.490 --> 01:20:16.500 align:start position:0%
there is there is a law in place now
 
01:20:18.830 --> 01:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
that we have to not only introduce that
 
01:20:20.450 --> 01:20:20.460 align:start position:0%
training at the recruit level but to
 
01:20:22.130 --> 01:20:22.140 align:start position:0%
make sure that in-service officers
 
01:20:25.430 --> 01:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
annually are receiving that training
 
01:20:29.689 --> 01:20:29.699 align:start position:0%
um to including retirees so
 
01:20:31.850 --> 01:20:31.860 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:20:35.090 --> 01:20:35.100 align:start position:0%
um so in light of that and kind of
 
01:20:36.770 --> 01:20:36.780 align:start position:0%
pigtailing on
 
01:20:38.630 --> 01:20:38.640 align:start position:0%
um representative gerhart's comments
 
01:20:40.490 --> 01:20:40.500 align:start position:0%
regarding social workers
 
01:20:43.189 --> 01:20:43.199 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming that putting full-time
 
01:20:45.709 --> 01:20:45.719 align:start position:0%
instructors in place with those
 
01:20:49.430 --> 01:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
Specialties might not require 40 hours a
 
01:20:50.990 --> 01:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
week of training in those specialty
 
01:20:52.370 --> 01:20:52.380 align:start position:0%
areas and probably you have other
 
01:20:54.530 --> 01:20:54.540 align:start position:0%
specialty areas as well which is part of
 
01:20:56.930 --> 01:20:56.940 align:start position:0%
why you need the flexibility to be able
 
01:20:59.990 --> 01:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
to pull part-time instructors in for
 
01:21:02.689 --> 01:21:02.699 align:start position:0%
some specialty areas is that correct I I
 
01:21:06.110 --> 01:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
that that is absolutely correct uh you
 
01:21:08.149 --> 01:21:08.159 align:start position:0%
know candidly and representative goalie
 
01:21:10.669 --> 01:21:10.679 align:start position:0%
uh spoke to it earlier if there was a
 
01:21:12.770 --> 01:21:12.780 align:start position:0%
way for me to increase the full-time
 
01:21:15.229 --> 01:21:15.239 align:start position:0%
staff uh staying within budget
 
01:21:17.810 --> 01:21:17.820 align:start position:0%
constraints and be responsible in that
 
01:21:21.050 --> 01:21:21.060 align:start position:0%
manner I certainly would pursue that and
 
01:21:23.689 --> 01:21:23.699 align:start position:0%
and have pursued it in the the short two
 
01:21:24.830 --> 01:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
and a half years that I've been the
 
01:21:26.590 --> 01:21:26.600 align:start position:0%
director of the police academy
 
01:21:31.130 --> 01:21:31.140 align:start position:0%
so any steps uh that that I can take to
 
01:21:34.310 --> 01:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
help augment uh in the meantime while we
 
01:21:37.130 --> 01:21:37.140 align:start position:0%
build out that full-time staff would be
 
01:21:42.290 --> 01:21:42.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:44.570 --> 01:21:44.580 align:start position:0%
I was just wondering how many uh
 
01:21:47.750 --> 01:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
part-time staff do you have uh presently
 
01:21:49.610 --> 01:21:49.620 align:start position:0%
I have three
 
01:21:53.930 --> 01:21:53.940 align:start position:0%
okay and one of them uh to uh the
 
01:21:55.310 --> 01:21:55.320 align:start position:0%
representatives question earlier about
 
01:21:58.070 --> 01:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
subject matter experts uh we were very
 
01:22:00.229 --> 01:22:00.239 align:start position:0%
lucky to secure him after a 20-year
 
01:22:04.430 --> 01:22:04.440 align:start position:0%
career at uh Dover PD who teaches just
 
01:22:07.130 --> 01:22:07.140 align:start position:0%
crime scene response responding to crime
 
01:22:08.689 --> 01:22:08.699 align:start position:0%
scenes the collection of evidence which
 
01:22:13.370 --> 01:22:13.380 align:start position:0%
is a very very narrow uh uh topic area
 
01:22:16.010 --> 01:22:16.020 align:start position:0%
and we're very lucky to have him
 
01:22:18.470 --> 01:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up and my impression is
 
01:22:20.570 --> 01:22:20.580 align:start position:0%
you have more more things that are
 
01:22:22.310 --> 01:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
taught by people that aren't full-time
 
01:22:23.810 --> 01:22:23.820 align:start position:0%
staff I remember the other people as you
 
01:22:26.330 --> 01:22:26.340 align:start position:0%
said volunteers or Consultants that are
 
01:22:27.950 --> 01:22:27.960 align:start position:0%
brought in or you know I was surprised
 
01:22:30.950 --> 01:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
by how low that number was yeah we we
 
01:22:33.590 --> 01:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
have always prided ourselves and and I
 
01:22:35.750 --> 01:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
worked as a training specialist about 20
 
01:22:37.669 --> 01:22:37.679 align:start position:0%
years ago at the police academy during
 
01:22:41.570 --> 01:22:41.580 align:start position:0%
my police career uh uh director Sweeney
 
01:22:45.890 --> 01:22:45.900 align:start position:0%
uh who uh had run the police academy for
 
01:22:49.010 --> 01:22:49.020 align:start position:0%
a number of years uh really looked at at
 
01:22:51.110 --> 01:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
police standards and training as kind of
 
01:22:54.890 --> 01:22:54.900 align:start position:0%
a credit union where uh everybody added
 
01:22:57.770 --> 01:22:57.780 align:start position:0%
a little something right and and uh
 
01:22:59.870 --> 01:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
everybody could volunteer a little bit
 
01:23:03.709 --> 01:23:03.719 align:start position:0%
of time and we could benefit uh
 
01:23:06.649 --> 01:23:06.659 align:start position:0%
tremendously throughout our state uh the
 
01:23:08.990 --> 01:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
unfortunate truth is that
 
01:23:12.350 --> 01:23:12.360 align:start position:0%
um because there is that 20 reduction in
 
01:23:16.070 --> 01:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
staff across the board uh because it's
 
01:23:17.810 --> 01:23:17.820 align:start position:0%
just kind of a new way of looking at the
 
01:23:19.430 --> 01:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
world where you know people have an
 
01:23:21.830 --> 01:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
expectation to be compensated for their
 
01:23:21.840 --> 01:23:22.810 align:start position:0%
expectation to be compensated for their
time

01:23:22.810 --> 01:23:22.820 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:23:25.870 --> 01:23:25.880 align:start position:0%
I don't know that that model has surv
 
01:23:29.390 --> 01:23:29.400 align:start position:0%
we still rely on it very heavily
 
01:23:32.149 --> 01:23:32.159 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you sir other questions
 
01:23:34.310 --> 01:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
representative Wilhelm thank you madam
 
01:23:35.870 --> 01:23:35.880 align:start position:0%
chair thanks for taking my question you
 
01:23:37.550 --> 01:23:37.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned the Lee act commission
 
01:23:39.649 --> 01:23:39.659 align:start position:0%
recommendations and how that's uh
 
01:23:41.870 --> 01:23:41.880 align:start position:0%
increased training time from eight hours
 
01:23:44.510 --> 01:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
to 24 hours and also said it was a
 
01:23:48.229 --> 01:23:48.239 align:start position:0%
three-year uh investment of time is it
 
01:23:49.430 --> 01:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
is it
 
01:23:51.229 --> 01:23:51.239 align:start position:0%
24 hours over the course of the three
 
01:23:53.810 --> 01:23:53.820 align:start position:0%
years or is it 24 hours per year so
 
01:23:56.830 --> 01:23:56.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for this question uh
 
01:24:00.110 --> 01:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
uh presently it would check that last
 
01:24:02.870 --> 01:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
year every certified officer had to
 
01:24:04.850 --> 01:24:04.860 align:start position:0%
complete eight hours of in-service
 
01:24:07.550 --> 01:24:07.560 align:start position:0%
training within that that calendar year
 
01:24:11.450 --> 01:24:11.460 align:start position:0%
to maintain their certification uh this
 
01:24:13.790 --> 01:24:13.800 align:start position:0%
year that number has gone up a little
 
01:24:17.930 --> 01:24:17.940 align:start position:0%
bit to 10 and then it will go to 18 the
 
01:24:20.990 --> 01:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
year after that and then 24 so they'll
 
01:24:23.390 --> 01:24:23.400 align:start position:0%
have to complete 24 hours of training
 
01:24:25.610 --> 01:24:25.620 align:start position:0%
within that calendar a year and that
 
01:24:27.530 --> 01:24:27.540 align:start position:0%
really kind of brings us up to about a
 
01:24:29.810 --> 01:24:29.820 align:start position:0%
national average as compared to other
 
01:24:29.820 --> 01:24:30.770 align:start position:0%
national average as compared to other
states

01:24:30.770 --> 01:24:30.780 align:start position:0%
states
 
01:24:30.780 --> 01:24:32.870 align:start position:0%
states
follow-up

01:24:32.870 --> 01:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:24:36.169 --> 01:24:36.179 align:start position:0%
uh and so once it hits 24
 
01:24:38.649 --> 01:24:38.659 align:start position:0%
it will continue to be 24 year over year
 
01:24:43.010 --> 01:24:43.020 align:start position:0%
uh based on existing uh language in the
 
01:24:45.350 --> 01:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
law and administrative rule yes great
 
01:24:49.430 --> 01:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:52.430 --> 01:24:52.440 align:start position:0%
I I have a comment I certainly hope that
 
01:24:55.510 --> 01:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
since the liac commission imposed
 
01:24:59.149 --> 01:24:59.159 align:start position:0%
significant extra responsibilities on
 
01:25:01.870 --> 01:25:01.880 align:start position:0%
your organization more training hours
 
01:25:05.570 --> 01:25:05.580 align:start position:0%
the conduct review committees and things
 
01:25:08.390 --> 01:25:08.400 align:start position:0%
like that that you've pointed that out
 
01:25:10.430 --> 01:25:10.440 align:start position:0%
to the governor in your budget requests
 
01:25:13.790 --> 01:25:13.800 align:start position:0%
yes you have okay good yes Madam it's uh
 
01:25:16.130 --> 01:25:16.140 align:start position:0%
because seriously if you're being asked
 
01:25:19.430 --> 01:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
to do more work with the same staff it's
 
01:25:23.090 --> 01:25:23.100 align:start position:0%
not really fair for the staff so
 
01:25:23.100 --> 01:25:24.590 align:start position:0%
not really fair for the staff so
dependent

01:25:24.590 --> 01:25:24.600 align:start position:0%
dependent
 
01:25:27.709 --> 01:25:27.719 align:start position:0%
all right any other questions
 
01:25:30.590 --> 01:25:30.600 align:start position:0%

01:25:45.350 --> 01:25:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:47.030 --> 01:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair again for the
 
01:25:49.070 --> 01:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
record Marty Carlin representing the New
 
01:25:51.470 --> 01:25:51.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire retirement system I signed up
 
01:25:53.090 --> 01:25:53.100 align:start position:0%
to testify just to provide some
 
01:25:55.550 --> 01:25:55.560 align:start position:0%
background information on the current uh
 
01:25:58.669 --> 01:25:58.679 align:start position:0%
statutory landscape regarding retirees
 
01:25:58.679 --> 01:26:00.050 align:start position:0%
statutory landscape regarding retirees
working

01:26:00.050 --> 01:26:00.060 align:start position:0%
working
 
01:26:02.149 --> 01:26:02.159 align:start position:0%
um for participating Employers in the
 
01:26:04.010 --> 01:26:04.020 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire
 
01:26:06.649 --> 01:26:06.659 align:start position:0%
um the law lies overall governing
 
01:26:08.270 --> 01:26:08.280 align:start position:0%
working after retirement were last
 
01:26:11.510 --> 01:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
changed in the 2018 session uh effective
 
01:26:15.669 --> 01:26:15.679 align:start position:0%
1-1 of 19 and under the current law
 
01:26:17.930 --> 01:26:17.940 align:start position:0%
retired members
 
01:26:20.270 --> 01:26:20.280 align:start position:0%
um who are collecting a pension can work
 
01:26:23.570 --> 01:26:23.580 align:start position:0%
up in whoever retired since
 
01:26:23.580 --> 01:26:24.950 align:start position:0%
up in whoever retired since
um

01:26:24.950 --> 01:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:27.310 --> 01:26:27.320 align:start position:0%
since the law change can work
 
01:26:30.649 --> 01:26:30.659 align:start position:0%
1352 hours per calendar year
 
01:26:32.870 --> 01:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
so that's not a weekly limit it's not a
 
01:26:34.430 --> 01:26:34.440 align:start position:0%
monthly limit it's it's a calendar year
 
01:26:36.830 --> 01:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
limit that averages out to 26 hours a
 
01:26:39.050 --> 01:26:39.060 align:start position:0%
week but it doesn't mandate that they
 
01:26:41.149 --> 01:26:41.159 align:start position:0%
can't work more than 26 hours in a given
 
01:26:44.149 --> 01:26:44.159 align:start position:0%
week as long as it's not a temporary uh
 
01:26:46.550 --> 01:26:46.560 align:start position:0%
permanent full-time position with you
 
01:26:48.169 --> 01:26:48.179 align:start position:0%
know regularly scheduled to work more
 
01:26:48.179 --> 01:26:49.209 align:start position:0%
know regularly scheduled to work more
hours

01:26:49.209 --> 01:26:49.219 align:start position:0%
hours
 
01:26:52.010 --> 01:26:52.020 align:start position:0%
retirees can work you know
 
01:26:54.649 --> 01:26:54.659 align:start position:0%
30 40 50 hours if it's a seasonal
 
01:26:56.750 --> 01:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
part-time you know um you know detail
 
01:26:59.090 --> 01:26:59.100 align:start position:0%
work at Hampton Beach working at a state
 
01:27:00.890 --> 01:27:00.900 align:start position:0%
park in the summer or plowing in the
 
01:27:03.350 --> 01:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
winter things like that so so so that
 
01:27:05.990 --> 01:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
the the prior statute was a weekly limit
 
01:27:08.570 --> 01:27:08.580 align:start position:0%
of 30 no more than 32 hours so that was
 
01:27:11.570 --> 01:27:11.580 align:start position:0%
a hard stop on every single week uh this
 
01:27:13.970 --> 01:27:13.980 align:start position:0%
change while it reduced the hours for
 
01:27:15.830 --> 01:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
new retirees
 
01:27:18.410 --> 01:27:18.420 align:start position:0%
um to an average of 26 it gives more
 
01:27:20.530 --> 01:27:20.540 align:start position:0%
flexibility within the calendar year
 
01:27:23.930 --> 01:27:23.940 align:start position:0%
employers report hours work by retirees
 
01:27:25.430 --> 01:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
to the New Hampshire retirement system
 
01:27:27.169 --> 01:27:27.179 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of the the next
 
01:27:29.530 --> 01:27:29.540 align:start position:0%
calendar year so we're actually
 
01:27:31.490 --> 01:27:31.500 align:start position:0%
accepting um
 
01:27:34.490 --> 01:27:34.500 align:start position:0%
reports from participating employers now
 
01:27:36.950 --> 01:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
through February 15th
 
01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:38.090 align:start position:0%
through February 15th
um

01:27:38.090 --> 01:27:38.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:40.430 --> 01:27:40.440 align:start position:0%
if if there's also a there's a
 
01:27:42.250 --> 01:27:42.260 align:start position:0%
grandfathering provision put in the law
 
01:27:46.430 --> 01:27:46.440 align:start position:0%
uh back in 2018 that said that any
 
01:27:48.830 --> 01:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
retiree already working in a part-time
 
01:27:48.840 --> 01:27:49.810 align:start position:0%
retiree already working in a part-time
position

01:27:49.810 --> 01:27:49.820 align:start position:0%
position
 
01:27:52.629 --> 01:27:52.639 align:start position:0%
was allowed to work a total of
 
01:27:55.669 --> 01:27:55.679 align:start position:0%
1664 hours in a calendar year that
 
01:27:58.790 --> 01:27:58.800 align:start position:0%
averages out to 32 hours a week for as
 
01:28:00.350 --> 01:28:00.360 align:start position:0%
long as they stayed in that same
 
01:28:03.110 --> 01:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
position with the same employer so if
 
01:28:03.120 --> 01:28:04.189 align:start position:0%
position with the same employer so if
somebody

01:28:04.189 --> 01:28:04.199 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
01:28:07.430 --> 01:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
left town X to go to town y
 
01:28:09.470 --> 01:28:09.480 align:start position:0%
um you know they would be limited to the
 
01:28:11.270 --> 01:28:11.280 align:start position:0%
1352 but so there were some
 
01:28:13.129 --> 01:28:13.139 align:start position:0%
grandfathered folks who were still
 
01:28:15.830 --> 01:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
working up to 1664 hours in a calendar
 
01:28:21.610 --> 01:28:21.620 align:start position:0%
year now both the 13th uh 52 and the uh
 
01:28:25.129 --> 01:28:25.139 align:start position:0%
1664. our cumulative hours worked by the
 
01:28:28.550 --> 01:28:28.560 align:start position:0%
retiree for one or more employers so in
 
01:28:30.950 --> 01:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
other words you can't work 1500 1300
 
01:28:32.870 --> 01:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
hours for one employer and 1300 for
 
01:28:34.669 --> 01:28:34.679 align:start position:0%
another you know the the hours follow
 
01:28:37.850 --> 01:28:37.860 align:start position:0%
the retiree so you know we don't know
 
01:28:39.770 --> 01:28:39.780 align:start position:0%
how many people are working for multiple
 
01:28:42.169 --> 01:28:42.179 align:start position:0%
employers or for how much until those
 
01:28:43.790 --> 01:28:43.800 align:start position:0%
employers report the numbers back into
 
01:28:47.149 --> 01:28:47.159 align:start position:0%
us the following year
 
01:28:47.159 --> 01:28:47.950 align:start position:0%
us the following year
um

01:28:47.950 --> 01:28:47.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:50.870 --> 01:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
the um there was a penalty for exceeding
 
01:28:53.629 --> 01:28:53.639 align:start position:0%
the statutory limits right now which is
 
01:28:56.629 --> 01:28:56.639 align:start position:0%
um if if you know you were actually
 
01:28:59.390 --> 01:28:59.400 align:start position:0%
worked over the limits the state portion
 
01:29:01.310 --> 01:29:01.320 align:start position:0%
of the member's pension would be
 
01:29:03.770 --> 01:29:03.780 align:start position:0%
withheld for 12 months
 
01:29:05.689 --> 01:29:05.699 align:start position:0%
um which on average is about half the
 
01:29:07.669 --> 01:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
pension it could be more of of the
 
01:29:10.430 --> 01:29:10.440 align:start position:0%
benefit or it could be less depending on
 
01:29:12.649 --> 01:29:12.659 align:start position:0%
um various factors and the members work
 
01:29:15.830 --> 01:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
history and salary history but um since
 
01:29:18.410 --> 01:29:18.420 align:start position:0%
the law has been enacted only one person
 
01:29:20.390 --> 01:29:20.400 align:start position:0%
has gone over it
 
01:29:25.189 --> 01:29:25.199 align:start position:0%
um and also uh there are there is um one
 
01:29:27.830 --> 01:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
there's there are some exceptions to
 
01:29:30.830 --> 01:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
those hours work limits right now
 
01:29:33.470 --> 01:29:33.480 align:start position:0%
um it's um it's a section that says that
 
01:29:36.169 --> 01:29:36.179 align:start position:0%
ours worked under the direction of the
 
01:29:37.669 --> 01:29:37.679 align:start position:0%
division of Fire
 
01:29:41.450 --> 01:29:41.460 align:start position:0%
uh fighting uh no forest fires in the in
 
01:29:44.030 --> 01:29:44.040 align:start position:0%
the North Country hours doing that are
 
01:29:46.970 --> 01:29:46.980 align:start position:0%
Exempted and also any hours worked by
 
01:29:49.070 --> 01:29:49.080 align:start position:0%
anyone during a state of emergency
 
01:29:53.510 --> 01:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
declared by the governor now until covid
 
01:29:55.189 --> 01:29:55.199 align:start position:0%
um my my friends at the department of
 
01:29:57.290 --> 01:29:57.300 align:start position:0%
safety told me that there were only 12
 
01:29:59.209 --> 01:29:59.219 align:start position:0%
declared emergencies by the governor
 
01:30:01.790 --> 01:30:01.800 align:start position:0%
Statewide since the 1950s however
 
01:30:04.669 --> 01:30:04.679 align:start position:0%
essentially New Hampshire was in a state
 
01:30:07.070 --> 01:30:07.080 align:start position:0%
of emergency for 14 months so pretty
 
01:30:09.169 --> 01:30:09.179 align:start position:0%
much anybody who was a retiree who
 
01:30:11.810 --> 01:30:11.820 align:start position:0%
worked in either calendar year 20 or 21
 
01:30:14.030 --> 01:30:14.040 align:start position:0%
wasn't going to exceed those hours
 
01:30:16.189 --> 01:30:16.199 align:start position:0%
because none of them counted
 
01:30:17.510 --> 01:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
um so that that's one of the reasons
 
01:30:20.990 --> 01:30:21.000 align:start position:0%
we've only seen one person so far so
 
01:30:23.450 --> 01:30:23.460 align:start position:0%
um with that background I just just be
 
01:30:25.910 --> 01:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
glad to answer any questions about the
 
01:30:27.709 --> 01:30:27.719 align:start position:0%
law and how that works and it actually I
 
01:30:32.510 --> 01:30:32.520 align:start position:0%
will mention that the 1352 is the
 
01:30:35.689 --> 01:30:35.699 align:start position:0%
highest number of hours among all the
 
01:30:37.189 --> 01:30:37.199 align:start position:0%
New England states and among the highest
 
01:30:40.610 --> 01:30:40.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:43.010 --> 01:30:43.020 align:start position:0%
okay other questions representative
 
01:30:45.590 --> 01:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
O'Brien and then representative Gould
 
01:30:48.229 --> 01:30:48.239 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question and
 
01:30:51.350 --> 01:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh Mr College
 
01:30:51.360 --> 01:30:52.090 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh Mr College
um

01:30:52.090 --> 01:30:52.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:55.850 --> 01:30:55.860 align:start position:0%
Chief uh Phillips mentioned the
 
01:30:58.790 --> 01:30:58.800 align:start position:0%
cumulative effect that you said it it
 
01:31:02.750 --> 01:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
came at a later date you know in in the
 
01:31:05.229 --> 01:31:05.239 align:start position:0%
history but uh because I did remember
 
01:31:08.209 --> 01:31:08.219 align:start position:0%
when the numbers were mentioned 25 years
 
01:31:11.689 --> 01:31:11.699 align:start position:0%
I remember it being at 32 and you know
 
01:31:14.209 --> 01:31:14.219 align:start position:0%
it was something everybody watched but
 
01:31:18.649 --> 01:31:18.659 align:start position:0%
the thing is if we are we heading in the
 
01:31:20.590 --> 01:31:20.600 align:start position:0%
retirements uh
 
01:31:23.750 --> 01:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
nhrs physician are we heading the right
 
01:31:25.910 --> 01:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
direction to solve a problem here would
 
01:31:28.610 --> 01:31:28.620 align:start position:0%
it be looking at the cumulative effect
 
01:31:31.370 --> 01:31:31.380 align:start position:0%
and modifying that to some degree
 
01:31:33.770 --> 01:31:33.780 align:start position:0%
workable would that be a better way to
 
01:31:35.390 --> 01:31:35.400 align:start position:0%
go about this
 
01:31:37.729 --> 01:31:37.739 align:start position:0%
um I I'm not sure how to directly answer
 
01:31:39.770 --> 01:31:39.780 align:start position:0%
your question but just just as by way of
 
01:31:42.169 --> 01:31:42.179 align:start position:0%
background the the 32-hour weekly limit
 
01:31:44.990 --> 01:31:45.000 align:start position:0%
was enacted in 2011 and prior to that
 
01:31:46.970 --> 01:31:46.980 align:start position:0%
there was nothing in the statute per se
 
01:31:50.090 --> 01:31:50.100 align:start position:0%
about retirees working
 
01:31:51.950 --> 01:31:51.960 align:start position:0%
um you know after collecting a benefit
 
01:31:54.110 --> 01:31:54.120 align:start position:0%
and working for participating employer
 
01:31:57.189 --> 01:31:57.199 align:start position:0%
so by default we referred to our
 
01:31:59.890 --> 01:31:59.900 align:start position:0%
administrative rules which Define
 
01:32:02.990 --> 01:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
full-time for employees teachers police
 
01:32:06.050 --> 01:32:06.060 align:start position:0%
and fire so in reality uh anyone who was
 
01:32:07.610 --> 01:32:07.620 align:start position:0%
working a half an hour less a week than
 
01:32:09.410 --> 01:32:09.420 align:start position:0%
what's defined as full time in the rules
 
01:32:12.830 --> 01:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
you know was fine there were some cases
 
01:32:14.870 --> 01:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
that made the headlines back then that
 
01:32:18.229 --> 01:32:18.239 align:start position:0%
led to the 2032 and then the decennial
 
01:32:20.090 --> 01:32:20.100 align:start position:0%
commission looked at that and
 
01:32:22.970 --> 01:32:22.980 align:start position:0%
um at as an issue and then the um
 
01:32:26.510 --> 01:32:26.520 align:start position:0%
uh was was turned to the 1352 was is a
 
01:32:29.090 --> 01:32:29.100 align:start position:0%
cumulative piece now in terms of the
 
01:32:31.550 --> 01:32:31.560 align:start position:0%
retirement system the only
 
01:32:34.910 --> 01:32:34.920 align:start position:0%
um impact retirees working uh after
 
01:32:36.890 --> 01:32:36.900 align:start position:0%
retirement and collecting a benefit on
 
01:32:40.610 --> 01:32:40.620 align:start position:0%
us is when those retirees are
 
01:32:42.950 --> 01:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
replacing full-time positions that
 
01:32:46.610 --> 01:32:46.620 align:start position:0%
remain unfilled so if if you hired a you
 
01:32:48.110 --> 01:32:48.120 align:start position:0%
know a
 
01:32:50.330 --> 01:32:50.340 align:start position:0%
10 part-timers to do the work of five
 
01:32:52.850 --> 01:32:52.860 align:start position:0%
full-timers that's five people five
 
01:32:54.950 --> 01:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
positions we're no longer receiving uh
 
01:32:56.629 --> 01:32:56.639 align:start position:0%
contributions on
 
01:32:59.149 --> 01:32:59.159 align:start position:0%
um for the unfunded liability uh and
 
01:33:01.189 --> 01:33:01.199 align:start position:0%
those that money still needs to come
 
01:33:03.229 --> 01:33:03.239 align:start position:0%
into us so you know to the extent that
 
01:33:05.990 --> 01:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
more positions of active members are
 
01:33:08.510 --> 01:33:08.520 align:start position:0%
removed from the system the rates go up
 
01:33:10.189 --> 01:33:10.199 align:start position:0%
on the remaining members in the system
 
01:33:11.870 --> 01:33:11.880 align:start position:0%
and all employers
 
01:33:14.330 --> 01:33:14.340 align:start position:0%
pay pay a little bit more
 
01:33:16.790 --> 01:33:16.800 align:start position:0%
um than they they would on a per person
 
01:33:20.689 --> 01:33:20.699 align:start position:0%
basis so that that's that's our only
 
01:33:20.699 --> 01:33:21.649 align:start position:0%
basis so that that's that's our only
um

01:33:21.649 --> 01:33:21.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:24.229 --> 01:33:24.239 align:start position:0%
concern from a funding perspective with
 
01:33:28.189 --> 01:33:28.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:31.970 --> 01:33:31.980 align:start position:0%
I follow up thank you madam chair uh
 
01:33:34.550 --> 01:33:34.560 align:start position:0%
would you be willing if if the chair
 
01:33:38.090 --> 01:33:38.100 align:start position:0%
agrees I don't know uh uh what the
 
01:33:40.430 --> 01:33:40.440 align:start position:0%
prognosis of this is but if we decide to
 
01:33:42.050 --> 01:33:42.060 align:start position:0%
put it into a committee which you work
 
01:33:43.610 --> 01:33:43.620 align:start position:0%
with the committee to look at that
 
01:33:46.129 --> 01:33:46.139 align:start position:0%
cumulative and see what would be the
 
01:33:49.370 --> 01:33:49.380 align:start position:0%
best way to you know dive deeper into
 
01:33:51.950 --> 01:33:51.960 align:start position:0%
this absolutely of course it's at the
 
01:33:54.709 --> 01:33:54.719 align:start position:0%
college yeah yes well actually it will
 
01:33:56.990 --> 01:33:57.000 align:start position:0%
be going to the pension subcommittee
 
01:33:58.910 --> 01:33:58.920 align:start position:0%
primarily because there's an amendment
 
01:34:01.610 --> 01:34:01.620 align:start position:0%
to be looked at that we need to discuss
 
01:34:04.189 --> 01:34:04.199 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to mention for the benefit
 
01:34:07.189 --> 01:34:07.199 align:start position:0%
of the committee that the reason there
 
01:34:10.189 --> 01:34:10.199 align:start position:0%
is a limit on part-time employment is
 
01:34:13.870 --> 01:34:13.880 align:start position:0%
exactly what Mr Carlin said that
 
01:34:18.350 --> 01:34:18.360 align:start position:0%
employers would have a an incentive to
 
01:34:18.360 --> 01:34:19.209 align:start position:0%
employers would have a an incentive to
replace

01:34:19.209 --> 01:34:19.219 align:start position:0%
replace
 
01:34:22.610 --> 01:34:22.620 align:start position:0%
full-time with part-time people because
 
01:34:24.470 --> 01:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
they don't have to pay the benefits
 
01:34:24.480 --> 01:34:25.790 align:start position:0%
they don't have to pay the benefits
which

01:34:25.790 --> 01:34:25.800 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:34:28.910 --> 01:34:28.920 align:start position:0%
the pension contribution is a large part
 
01:34:30.229 --> 01:34:30.239 align:start position:0%
of it
 
01:34:30.239 --> 01:34:30.790 align:start position:0%
of it
um

01:34:30.790 --> 01:34:30.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:34.370 --> 01:34:34.380 align:start position:0%
that's a way that
 
01:34:34.380 --> 01:34:35.770 align:start position:0%
that's a way that
that

01:34:35.770 --> 01:34:35.780 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:34:39.590 --> 01:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
helps the employer in the short term but
 
01:34:41.570 --> 01:34:41.580 align:start position:0%
it hurts the retirement system in the
 
01:34:44.330 --> 01:34:44.340 align:start position:0%
long term and so we are
 
01:34:47.330 --> 01:34:47.340 align:start position:0%
in 2011 it was decided that we should
 
01:34:50.090 --> 01:34:50.100 align:start position:0%
not be allowing that because
 
01:34:52.790 --> 01:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
not to mention the fact that it is a
 
01:34:57.050 --> 01:34:57.060 align:start position:0%
public relations nightmare when you're
 
01:35:00.410 --> 01:35:00.420 align:start position:0%
school superintendent retires and comes
 
01:35:04.189 --> 01:35:04.199 align:start position:0%
back to the exact same job part-time
 
01:35:06.830 --> 01:35:06.840 align:start position:0%
while so he's collecting his pension and
 
01:35:08.870 --> 01:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
a slightly reduced
 
01:35:11.570 --> 01:35:11.580 align:start position:0%
pay and the retirement system doesn't
 
01:35:17.810 --> 01:35:17.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:20.390 --> 01:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
we can talk about that okay so this will
 
01:35:23.390 --> 01:35:23.400 align:start position:0%
be going to the pension subcommittee and
 
01:35:25.189 --> 01:35:25.199 align:start position:0%
they will be uh
 
01:35:28.370 --> 01:35:28.380 align:start position:0%
looking at these issues
 
01:35:31.430 --> 01:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
is that's the last card is there anyone
 
01:35:32.870 --> 01:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
else who wishes to testify
 
01:35:35.390 --> 01:35:35.400 align:start position:0%
representative Gould oh I'm sorry
 
01:35:37.669 --> 01:35:37.679 align:start position:0%
forgive me that's quite all right thank
 
01:35:39.890 --> 01:35:39.900 align:start position:0%
you madam chair I'm not sure if this
 
01:35:41.810 --> 01:35:41.820 align:start position:0%
question is appropriate to go to you or
 
01:35:44.090 --> 01:35:44.100 align:start position:0%
not but you can let me know that I heard
 
01:35:48.229 --> 01:35:48.239 align:start position:0%
you talk about you don't get the data on
 
01:35:51.350 --> 01:35:51.360 align:start position:0%
the cumulative hours until the end of
 
01:35:52.850 --> 01:35:52.860 align:start position:0%
the year when they're reported in and
 
01:35:55.430 --> 01:35:55.440 align:start position:0%
previously we heard testimony that the
 
01:35:57.530 --> 01:35:57.540 align:start position:0%
managers on the job the directors on the
 
01:35:59.990 --> 01:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
in the different departments don't have
 
01:36:03.890 --> 01:36:03.900 align:start position:0%
access to the data about hours worked in
 
01:36:05.629 --> 01:36:05.639 align:start position:0%
various departments
 
01:36:08.450 --> 01:36:08.460 align:start position:0%
as someone who's managed these kind of
 
01:36:11.209 --> 01:36:11.219 align:start position:0%
programs that seems like a huge issue to
 
01:36:11.219 --> 01:36:12.110 align:start position:0%
programs that seems like a huge issue to
me

01:36:12.110 --> 01:36:12.120 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:36:14.450 --> 01:36:14.460 align:start position:0%
representative Gould yes the problem is
 
01:36:16.189 --> 01:36:16.199 align:start position:0%
not their work that they're working for
 
01:36:18.290 --> 01:36:18.300 align:start position:0%
another department in the state they're
 
01:36:20.330 --> 01:36:20.340 align:start position:0%
working for a Small Town Police or fire
 
01:36:23.470 --> 01:36:23.480 align:start position:0%
department that doesn't
 
01:36:27.050 --> 01:36:27.060 align:start position:0%
look at this data more frequently than
 
01:36:30.290 --> 01:36:30.300 align:start position:0%
once a year and that was my question is
 
01:36:32.450 --> 01:36:32.460 align:start position:0%
there a way and this is going to study
 
01:36:34.070 --> 01:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
committee so nobody has to tell me an
 
01:36:36.350 --> 01:36:36.360 align:start position:0%
answer here but I just hope that that
 
01:36:39.110 --> 01:36:39.120 align:start position:0%
whole issue of lack of data will be part
 
01:36:41.629 --> 01:36:41.639 align:start position:0%
of the consideration moving forward
 
01:36:44.330 --> 01:36:44.340 align:start position:0%
okay then we'll take a look at that
 
01:36:46.790 --> 01:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you hopefully the
 
01:36:49.070 --> 01:36:49.080 align:start position:0%
employee the person involved is keeping
 
01:36:51.709 --> 01:36:51.719 align:start position:0%
track but that's the only person who can
 
01:36:54.890 --> 01:36:54.900 align:start position:0%
if they are say working at the
 
01:36:59.270 --> 01:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
Warren and Webster fire departments
 
01:37:00.830 --> 01:37:00.840 align:start position:0%
you know something or something like
 
01:37:02.870 --> 01:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
that nobody else wouldn't would know
 
01:37:04.250 --> 01:37:04.260 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:37:06.410 --> 01:37:06.420 align:start position:0%
quite common
 
01:37:10.550 --> 01:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
so any other questions for Mr Carla
 
01:37:10.560 --> 01:37:11.689 align:start position:0%
so any other questions for Mr Carla
yes

01:37:11.689 --> 01:37:11.699 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:37:14.270 --> 01:37:14.280 align:start position:0%
okay you got to follow us thank you
 
01:37:15.709 --> 01:37:15.719 align:start position:0%
representative true
 
01:37:17.810 --> 01:37:17.820 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:37:20.209 --> 01:37:20.219 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question
 
01:37:25.250 --> 01:37:25.260 align:start position:0%
so the hours worked of a retired fireman
 
01:37:28.189 --> 01:37:28.199 align:start position:0%
not only the hours worked for a fire
 
01:37:28.199 --> 01:37:29.810 align:start position:0%
not only the hours worked for a fire
department

01:37:29.810 --> 01:37:29.820 align:start position:0%
department
 
01:37:34.070 --> 01:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
it depends I mean we actually probably
 
01:37:36.709 --> 01:37:36.719 align:start position:0%
fire retirees or have the the smallest
 
01:37:39.350 --> 01:37:39.360 align:start position:0%
amount of ability to work for fire
 
01:37:41.090 --> 01:37:41.100 align:start position:0%
department part-time typically those are
 
01:37:42.470 --> 01:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
you know full-time more volunteer
 
01:37:44.090 --> 01:37:44.100 align:start position:0%
positions but
 
01:37:46.610 --> 01:37:46.620 align:start position:0%
um we we you know a retired firefighter
 
01:37:48.530 --> 01:37:48.540 align:start position:0%
could work as a substitute teacher you
 
01:37:50.510 --> 01:37:50.520 align:start position:0%
know or you know it they people can can
 
01:37:52.850 --> 01:37:52.860 align:start position:0%
move around within different you know if
 
01:37:55.610 --> 01:37:55.620 align:start position:0%
different positions were for political
 
01:37:58.070 --> 01:37:58.080 align:start position:0%
subdivisions it's not all straight you
 
01:37:59.810 --> 01:37:59.820 align:start position:0%
know firefighters are only retired
 
01:38:01.370 --> 01:38:01.380 align:start position:0%
Fighters will only work you know in in
 
01:38:03.530 --> 01:38:03.540 align:start position:0%
the fire service they they there's
 
01:38:06.950 --> 01:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
there's wiggle room thank you to any any
 
01:38:09.830 --> 01:38:09.840 align:start position:0%
participating employer which means every
 
01:38:14.330 --> 01:38:14.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:17.629 --> 01:38:17.639 align:start position:0%
so any anyone else
 
01:38:19.790 --> 01:38:19.800 align:start position:0%
all right thank you thank you yes
 
01:38:22.270 --> 01:38:22.280 align:start position:0%
representative just Just for information
 
01:38:26.689 --> 01:38:26.699 align:start position:0%
purposes uh a retiree could work at the
 
01:38:29.330 --> 01:38:29.340 align:start position:0%
local grocery store as many hours as he
 
01:38:31.430 --> 01:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
wants because they don't contribute to
 
01:38:33.890 --> 01:38:33.900 align:start position:0%
the retirement system
 
01:38:33.900 --> 01:38:35.930 align:start position:0%

01:39:30.050 --> 01:39:30.060 align:start position:0%
this bill is uh kind of an
 
01:39:31.910 --> 01:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
administrative cleanup bill that came in
 
01:39:35.270 --> 01:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
at a request of the retirement system
 
01:39:38.209 --> 01:39:38.219 align:start position:0%
it's got eight pieces in here rather
 
01:39:40.250 --> 01:39:40.260 align:start position:0%
than uh abusing the committee with eight
 
01:39:42.530 --> 01:39:42.540 align:start position:0%
separate bills so
 
01:39:44.629 --> 01:39:44.639 align:start position:0%
um if the chair is okay with it what I'm
 
01:39:47.629 --> 01:39:47.639 align:start position:0%
going to do is give a brief overview
 
01:39:49.610 --> 01:39:49.620 align:start position:0%
of each section
 
01:39:52.729 --> 01:39:52.739 align:start position:0%
and deal with any questions there and if
 
01:39:55.310 --> 01:39:55.320 align:start position:0%
we have uh Marty Carlin from the
 
01:39:58.189 --> 01:39:58.199 align:start position:0%
retirement system and Matt Kavanaugh an
 
01:40:00.470 --> 01:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
attorney for the retirement system who
 
01:40:01.610 --> 01:40:01.620 align:start position:0%
uh you know should be able to answer
 
01:40:04.070 --> 01:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
questions I can't
 
01:40:04.080 --> 01:40:05.390 align:start position:0%
questions I can't
so

01:40:05.390 --> 01:40:05.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:40:08.030 --> 01:40:08.040 align:start position:0%
um the first one is cleaning up the
 
01:40:10.370 --> 01:40:10.380 align:start position:0%
language around a teacher job sharing I
 
01:40:11.570 --> 01:40:11.580 align:start position:0%
guess there are
 
01:40:15.410 --> 01:40:15.420 align:start position:0%
situations where two teachers I suppose
 
01:40:17.050 --> 01:40:17.060 align:start position:0%
more but well it's two
 
01:40:19.669 --> 01:40:19.679 align:start position:0%
they're basically covering the same job
 
01:40:21.649 --> 01:40:21.659 align:start position:0%
and that's like to give them flexibility
 
01:40:24.470 --> 01:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
for for various reasons and then this
 
01:40:25.910 --> 01:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
deals with uh you know how is the
 
01:40:27.169 --> 01:40:27.179 align:start position:0%
pension handled in that kind of a
 
01:40:27.179 --> 01:40:29.390 align:start position:0%
pension handled in that kind of a
situation

01:40:29.390 --> 01:40:29.400 align:start position:0%
situation
 
01:40:32.810 --> 01:40:32.820 align:start position:0%
um and the intent of of this change is
 
01:40:35.090 --> 01:40:35.100 align:start position:0%
to clarify what equally share means in
 
01:40:37.610 --> 01:40:37.620 align:start position:0%
that context and to have this language
 
01:40:39.770 --> 01:40:39.780 align:start position:0%
also coordinated with other languages in
 
01:40:46.370 --> 01:40:46.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:46.380 --> 01:40:47.570 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:40:47.570 --> 01:40:47.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:49.430 --> 01:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
and you can see the language here now
 
01:40:52.070 --> 01:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
there was a request for an amendment
 
01:40:55.070 --> 01:40:55.080 align:start position:0%
that came in yesterday from
 
01:40:58.250 --> 01:40:58.260 align:start position:0%
a representative from the the Nea
 
01:41:01.669 --> 01:41:01.679 align:start position:0%
it sent email out about that and it just
 
01:41:03.410 --> 01:41:03.420 align:start position:0%
changes a couple words and I mean it
 
01:41:05.990 --> 01:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
adds a couple words and changes one and
 
01:41:08.290 --> 01:41:08.300 align:start position:0%
the intent there is to
 
01:41:08.300 --> 01:41:09.890 align:start position:0%
the intent there is to
clarify

01:41:09.890 --> 01:41:09.900 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
01:41:12.290 --> 01:41:12.300 align:start position:0%
exactly what this means I guess there
 
01:41:15.110 --> 01:41:15.120 align:start position:0%
was a situation in the past around this
 
01:41:17.110 --> 01:41:17.120 align:start position:0%
where there was a dispute between
 
01:41:20.149 --> 01:41:20.159 align:start position:0%
employees and the school district
 
01:41:22.970 --> 01:41:22.980 align:start position:0%
about the interpretation of it and the
 
01:41:24.770 --> 01:41:24.780 align:start position:0%
retirement system you know adjudicated
 
01:41:26.629 --> 01:41:26.639 align:start position:0%
that and actually agreed with the
 
01:41:29.030 --> 01:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
employee but the change was intended to
 
01:41:31.070 --> 01:41:31.080 align:start position:0%
avoid that kind of a thing in the future
 
01:41:33.229 --> 01:41:33.239 align:start position:0%
and if there's questions on the details
 
01:41:34.729 --> 01:41:34.739 align:start position:0%
on that there's someone else here who
 
01:41:36.950 --> 01:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
can speak on it but so any questions on
 
01:41:39.950 --> 01:41:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:42.169 --> 01:41:42.179 align:start position:0%
or I'll take them yeah sorry yes I do
 
01:41:44.209 --> 01:41:44.219 align:start position:0%
you have a
 
01:41:46.729 --> 01:41:46.739 align:start position:0%
um you do have the amendment I don't
 
01:41:48.709 --> 01:41:48.719 align:start position:0%
I've requested it from OLS I have not
 
01:41:50.030 --> 01:41:50.040 align:start position:0%
gotten it back
 
01:41:52.209 --> 01:41:52.219 align:start position:0%
okay I sent the request in last night
 
01:41:54.950 --> 01:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
got it which is why you haven't got it
 
01:41:57.410 --> 01:41:57.420 align:start position:0%
yet okay thank you very much
 
01:41:57.420 --> 01:41:58.430 align:start position:0%
yet okay thank you very much
okay

01:41:58.430 --> 01:41:58.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:42:00.290 --> 01:42:00.300 align:start position:0%
all right in that case
 
01:42:03.410 --> 01:42:03.420 align:start position:0%
um can move on to section two
 
01:42:06.290 --> 01:42:06.300 align:start position:0%
and this is declare this um
 
01:42:09.169 --> 01:42:09.179 align:start position:0%
has to do with how the retirement system
 
01:42:13.209 --> 01:42:13.219 align:start position:0%
handles uh compensation for
 
01:42:16.010 --> 01:42:16.020 align:start position:0%
extra special Duty which I think is
 
01:42:18.050 --> 01:42:18.060 align:start position:0%
mainly police officers maybe others I
 
01:42:20.149 --> 01:42:20.159 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
01:42:20.159 --> 01:42:20.870 align:start position:0%
don't know
um

01:42:20.870 --> 01:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:20.880 --> 01:42:23.209 align:start position:0%
um
and

01:42:23.209 --> 01:42:23.219 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:42:26.990 --> 01:42:27.000 align:start position:0%
the the issue is as I understand it is
 
01:42:28.609 --> 01:42:28.619 align:start position:0%
that there are things that look like
 
01:42:31.790 --> 01:42:31.800 align:start position:0%
special duty but if they're being funded
 
01:42:33.530 --> 01:42:33.540 align:start position:0%
um by a third party let's say a Federal
 
01:42:36.830 --> 01:42:36.840 align:start position:0%
Grant or something else
 
01:42:38.629 --> 01:42:38.639 align:start position:0%
um then it should be true the intent is
 
01:42:41.030 --> 01:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
to treat it as their normal employment
 
01:42:44.270 --> 01:42:44.280 align:start position:0%
pay and not you know actually special
 
01:42:47.990 --> 01:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
Duty and um and this is just to clarify
 
01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:49.850 align:start position:0%
Duty and um and this is just to clarify
that

01:42:49.850 --> 01:42:49.860 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:42:52.790 --> 01:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
so any fair question no questions on
 
01:42:55.550 --> 01:42:55.560 align:start position:0%
that I can move on
 
01:42:57.950 --> 01:42:57.960 align:start position:0%
uh like
 
01:43:00.410 --> 01:43:00.420 align:start position:0%
percent of O'Brien
 
01:43:02.689 --> 01:43:02.699 align:start position:0%
um representative electus I'm unclear
 
01:43:06.350 --> 01:43:06.360 align:start position:0%
but I know in my former Department we
 
01:43:10.189 --> 01:43:10.199 align:start position:0%
have people that do military duty and
 
01:43:12.590 --> 01:43:12.600 align:start position:0%
they have to go on assignments would
 
01:43:15.950 --> 01:43:15.960 align:start position:0%
this affect them because no that that's
 
01:43:17.450 --> 01:43:17.460 align:start position:0%
this is um
 
01:43:19.370 --> 01:43:19.380 align:start position:0%
like if the police are doing Special
 
01:43:22.310 --> 01:43:22.320 align:start position:0%
Duty like there's uh uh there's a
 
01:43:25.970 --> 01:43:25.980 align:start position:0%
utility work being done and uh so
 
01:43:28.070 --> 01:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
they're flagging you know they often you
 
01:43:29.450 --> 01:43:29.460 align:start position:0%
know they have to be present for that
 
01:43:31.070 --> 01:43:31.080 align:start position:0%
and that's paid for them by the utility
 
01:43:33.350 --> 01:43:33.360 align:start position:0%
or contractor or whatever thank you
 
01:43:35.090 --> 01:43:35.100 align:start position:0%
actually there are other sections here
 
01:43:37.790 --> 01:43:37.800 align:start position:0%
actually dealing with the military
 
01:43:37.800 --> 01:43:40.189 align:start position:0%
actually dealing with the military
good

01:43:40.189 --> 01:43:40.199 align:start position:0%
good
 
01:43:43.189 --> 01:43:43.199 align:start position:0%
okay thank you okay uh moving on to
 
01:43:45.590 --> 01:43:45.600 align:start position:0%
section three
 
01:43:45.600 --> 01:43:46.669 align:start position:0%
section three
um

01:43:46.669 --> 01:43:46.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:48.950 --> 01:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
it's in it's resolving an ambiguity
 
01:43:51.050 --> 01:43:51.060 align:start position:0%
between the term newly appointed and
 
01:43:53.330 --> 01:43:53.340 align:start position:0%
newly uh created
 
01:43:55.129 --> 01:43:55.139 align:start position:0%
and actually if there's questions on
 
01:44:02.689 --> 01:44:02.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:02.699 --> 01:44:04.189 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:44:04.189 --> 01:44:04.199 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:44:08.810 --> 01:44:08.820 align:start position:0%
all right on to section four
 
01:44:10.790 --> 01:44:10.800 align:start position:0%
um there were
 
01:44:13.609 --> 01:44:13.619 align:start position:0%
this was dealt with in two parts of the
 
01:44:16.669 --> 01:44:16.679 align:start position:0%
statute in 183
 
01:44:19.570 --> 01:44:19.580 align:start position:0%
Roman 4B and
 
01:44:19.580 --> 01:44:21.129 align:start position:0%
Roman 4B and
4A

01:44:21.129 --> 01:44:21.139 align:start position:0%
4A
 
01:44:23.810 --> 01:44:23.820 align:start position:0%
address basically the same thing and in
 
01:44:25.609 --> 01:44:25.619 align:start position:0%
one case
 
01:44:28.970 --> 01:44:28.980 align:start position:0%
um you know this is for uh
 
01:44:31.689 --> 01:44:31.699 align:start position:0%
withdrawn service purchase
 
01:44:34.250 --> 01:44:34.260 align:start position:0%
what that is one of them it had a time
 
01:44:36.290 --> 01:44:36.300 align:start position:0%
frame of a year the other one um six
 
01:44:37.729 --> 01:44:37.739 align:start position:0%
months and
 
01:44:40.250 --> 01:44:40.260 align:start position:0%
so we the statute made it impossible for
 
01:44:41.870 --> 01:44:41.880 align:start position:0%
the retirement system to follow the law
 
01:44:44.510 --> 01:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
since it was internally inconsistent and
 
01:44:46.010 --> 01:44:46.020 align:start position:0%
this would um
 
01:44:51.590 --> 01:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:52.790 --> 01:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you have anything else
 
01:44:55.250 --> 01:44:55.260 align:start position:0%
you could say about the details on what
 
01:44:55.260 --> 01:44:58.129 align:start position:0%
you could say about the details on what
this

01:44:58.129 --> 01:44:58.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:01.370 --> 01:45:01.380 align:start position:0%
yeah this is um if if someone who has
 
01:45:03.470 --> 01:45:03.480 align:start position:0%
previously withdrawn contributions from
 
01:45:05.149 --> 01:45:05.159 align:start position:0%
the retirement system for any reason you
 
01:45:06.350 --> 01:45:06.360 align:start position:0%
know they were terminated and they took
 
01:45:07.910 --> 01:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
their money out or they chose to stop
 
01:45:09.830 --> 01:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
working and then they're working for
 
01:45:11.209 --> 01:45:11.219 align:start position:0%
another employer and they want to buy
 
01:45:14.870 --> 01:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
that time back it puts a six-month
 
01:45:17.930 --> 01:45:17.940 align:start position:0%
minimum purchase on that that's six
 
01:45:19.490 --> 01:45:19.500 align:start position:0%
months is in another statute and that's
 
01:45:21.470 --> 01:45:21.480 align:start position:0%
how we've treated it administratively
 
01:45:23.810 --> 01:45:23.820 align:start position:0%
but this section that would be change
 
01:45:26.149 --> 01:45:26.159 align:start position:0%
refers to one month so we wanted to
 
01:45:27.890 --> 01:45:27.900 align:start position:0%
bring those in sync
 
01:45:29.750 --> 01:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
um and that would track with um current
 
01:45:29.760 --> 01:45:31.910 align:start position:0%
um and that would track with um current
practice

01:45:31.910 --> 01:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
practice
 
01:45:31.920 --> 01:45:35.990 align:start position:0%
practice
foreign

01:45:35.990 --> 01:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:39.229 --> 01:45:39.239 align:start position:0%
that answers the question I'll move on
 
01:45:39.239 --> 01:45:40.189 align:start position:0%
that answers the question I'll move on
to

01:45:40.189 --> 01:45:40.199 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:45:40.199 --> 01:45:43.010 align:start position:0%
to
um

01:45:43.010 --> 01:45:43.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:45.950 --> 01:45:45.960 align:start position:0%
a minor grammatical point but if we
 
01:45:49.550 --> 01:45:49.560 align:start position:0%
adopt that the apostrophe s would have
 
01:45:52.430 --> 01:45:52.440 align:start position:0%
to change to s apostrophe
 
01:45:52.440 --> 01:45:54.050 align:start position:0%
to change to s apostrophe
um

01:45:54.050 --> 01:45:54.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:56.930 --> 01:45:56.940 align:start position:0%
line 30 Mr grammar person that is
 
01:45:59.629 --> 01:45:59.639 align:start position:0%
absolutely correct
 
01:46:02.629 --> 01:46:02.639 align:start position:0%
okay another amendment for opal oh no no
 
01:46:05.510 --> 01:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
you just that's editorial oh okay fine
 
01:46:07.850 --> 01:46:07.860 align:start position:0%
but we have to Adaptive enough we have
 
01:46:10.430 --> 01:46:10.440 align:start position:0%
to adopt it first yeah okay
 
01:46:13.370 --> 01:46:13.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:16.850 --> 01:46:16.860 align:start position:0%
um you need a staff grammarian I guess
 
01:46:18.830 --> 01:46:18.840 align:start position:0%
well it's representative psychic on the
 
01:46:21.770 --> 01:46:21.780 align:start position:0%
position is open yes well we should have
 
01:46:26.090 --> 01:46:26.100 align:start position:0%
a new volunteer it seems so okay
 
01:46:26.100 --> 01:46:29.209 align:start position:0%
a new volunteer it seems so okay
um

01:46:29.209 --> 01:46:29.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:29.219 --> 01:46:34.790 align:start position:0%
 
see

01:46:34.790 --> 01:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:36.169 --> 01:46:36.179 align:start position:0%
well actually I'll leave this to Marty
 
01:46:38.330 --> 01:46:38.340 align:start position:0%
it has to do with uh you know there are
 
01:46:40.010 --> 01:46:40.020 align:start position:0%
times when people have to enroll and
 
01:46:41.689 --> 01:46:41.699 align:start position:0%
what if they don't
 
01:46:45.229 --> 01:46:45.239 align:start position:0%
yes there is a provision in the law that
 
01:46:47.930 --> 01:46:47.940 align:start position:0%
allows uh if a member through no fault
 
01:46:49.550 --> 01:46:49.560 align:start position:0%
of their own was
 
01:46:52.070 --> 01:46:52.080 align:start position:0%
um not enrolled by the employer or upon
 
01:46:54.350 --> 01:46:54.360 align:start position:0%
hire you know there was a clerical error
 
01:46:57.709 --> 01:46:57.719 align:start position:0%
or a misunderstanding of some sort that
 
01:47:00.830 --> 01:47:00.840 align:start position:0%
um you know they can uh once that's
 
01:47:03.290 --> 01:47:03.300 align:start position:0%
identified they can petition for service
 
01:47:06.590 --> 01:47:06.600 align:start position:0%
credit uh on that in both the the member
 
01:47:09.050 --> 01:47:09.060 align:start position:0%
pays in the the member contribution
 
01:47:10.970 --> 01:47:10.980 align:start position:0%
based on the time that they should have
 
01:47:12.709 --> 01:47:12.719 align:start position:0%
been enrolled and the employer pays the
 
01:47:16.370 --> 01:47:16.380 align:start position:0%
employer contribution on that and this
 
01:47:19.970 --> 01:47:19.980 align:start position:0%
um adds the the phrase not to put the
 
01:47:21.709 --> 01:47:21.719 align:start position:0%
person's election not to participate
 
01:47:24.590 --> 01:47:24.600 align:start position:0%
which just clarifies and puts the onus
 
01:47:27.470 --> 01:47:27.480 align:start position:0%
on the um presumption of fault is with
 
01:47:29.270 --> 01:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
the employer in those cases not the
 
01:47:29.280 --> 01:47:34.450 align:start position:0%
the employer in those cases not the
member

01:47:34.450 --> 01:47:34.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:37.490 --> 01:47:37.500 align:start position:0%
okay if there's no questions I'll go on
 
01:47:40.729 --> 01:47:40.739 align:start position:0%
to part six and again I'm going to turn
 
01:47:42.169 --> 01:47:42.179 align:start position:0%
this over to Marty because what this has
 
01:47:44.750 --> 01:47:44.760 align:start position:0%
to do is uh clarifying
 
01:47:48.350 --> 01:47:48.360 align:start position:0%
uh what happens for a military service
 
01:47:52.070 --> 01:47:52.080 align:start position:0%
members who cycle in and out of being
 
01:47:53.810 --> 01:47:53.820 align:start position:0%
with the military and then going back
 
01:47:56.149 --> 01:47:56.159 align:start position:0%
under the retirement system and and how
 
01:47:58.810 --> 01:47:58.820 align:start position:0%
that's all handled
 
01:48:01.370 --> 01:48:01.380 align:start position:0%
I'm probably going to have attorney
 
01:48:03.470 --> 01:48:03.480 align:start position:0%
Kavanaugh jump in over my shoulder on a
 
01:48:04.970 --> 01:48:04.980 align:start position:0%
couple of these especially if they're
 
01:48:08.270 --> 01:48:08.280 align:start position:0%
questions but he he as our associate
 
01:48:10.250 --> 01:48:10.260 align:start position:0%
counsel and compliance officer deals
 
01:48:11.990 --> 01:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
with these questions when they come up
 
01:48:15.410 --> 01:48:15.420 align:start position:0%
and also drafted these changes which is
 
01:48:17.090 --> 01:48:17.100 align:start position:0%
why it's great to have them uh here
 
01:48:19.729 --> 01:48:19.739 align:start position:0%
today but under my understanding this
 
01:48:22.129 --> 01:48:22.139 align:start position:0%
portion does two things there's some
 
01:48:24.530 --> 01:48:24.540 align:start position:0%
additional unnecessary language that it
 
01:48:27.590 --> 01:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
cleans up and it also clarifies the
 
01:48:29.990 --> 01:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
current provision regarding uh what
 
01:48:31.910 --> 01:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
portion of military service credit is
 
01:48:33.830 --> 01:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
free of cost and what requires the
 
01:48:36.169 --> 01:48:36.179 align:start position:0%
member to pay right now there are two
 
01:48:38.030 --> 01:48:38.040 align:start position:0%
types of military service credit
 
01:48:40.550 --> 01:48:40.560 align:start position:0%
available in the statute and the change
 
01:48:42.350 --> 01:48:42.360 align:start position:0%
deals with one where an active
 
01:48:44.330 --> 01:48:44.340 align:start position:0%
participating member of the retirement
 
01:48:47.149 --> 01:48:47.159 align:start position:0%
system is called to active military duty
 
01:48:49.729 --> 01:48:49.739 align:start position:0%
and that was much more common 10 15
 
01:48:51.470 --> 01:48:51.480 align:start position:0%
years ago than it is now but it's still
 
01:48:53.030 --> 01:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
quite possible with a lot of folks
 
01:48:55.430 --> 01:48:55.440 align:start position:0%
serving uh you know in the guard of the
 
01:48:57.890 --> 01:48:57.900 align:start position:0%
reserves things like that so
 
01:48:59.770 --> 01:48:59.780 align:start position:0%
um the
 
01:49:02.810 --> 01:49:02.820 align:start position:0%
way we've interpreted this the current
 
01:49:05.450 --> 01:49:05.460 align:start position:0%
law is that if someone is deployed
 
01:49:07.669 --> 01:49:07.679 align:start position:0%
returns you know finishes their
 
01:49:09.290 --> 01:49:09.300 align:start position:0%
deployment and comes back to work they
 
01:49:11.270 --> 01:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
can get up to three years of service
 
01:49:13.430 --> 01:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
added to their member record at no cost
 
01:49:17.030 --> 01:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
to them but but it is ambiguous
 
01:49:19.370 --> 01:49:19.380 align:start position:0%
um whether that arguably is per
 
01:49:21.169 --> 01:49:21.179 align:start position:0%
deployment or poorer
 
01:49:23.209 --> 01:49:23.219 align:start position:0%
are cumulative so that's what we're
 
01:49:25.669 --> 01:49:25.679 align:start position:0%
looking to clarify with that piece uh
 
01:49:28.910 --> 01:49:28.920 align:start position:0%
and the second piece is uh sort of a fun
 
01:49:32.090 --> 01:49:32.100 align:start position:0%
uh not fun but interesting uh that we're
 
01:49:34.669 --> 01:49:34.679 align:start position:0%
our statute is not in compliance with
 
01:49:37.189 --> 01:49:37.199 align:start position:0%
federal law regarding
 
01:49:37.199 --> 01:49:38.090 align:start position:0%
federal law regarding
um

01:49:38.090 --> 01:49:38.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:43.010 --> 01:49:43.020 align:start position:0%
purchase of prior military service we
 
01:49:44.990 --> 01:49:45.000 align:start position:0%
have a provision in our law that says
 
01:49:48.229 --> 01:49:48.239 align:start position:0%
you can only purchase purchase prior
 
01:49:50.810 --> 01:49:50.820 align:start position:0%
military service this is service
 
01:49:53.629 --> 01:49:53.639 align:start position:0%
given before you've joined nhrs as a
 
01:49:55.310 --> 01:49:55.320 align:start position:0%
contributing member
 
01:49:57.890 --> 01:49:57.900 align:start position:0%
um you can only make that purchase if
 
01:49:59.450 --> 01:49:59.460 align:start position:0%
you're not already collecting a military
 
01:50:02.570 --> 01:50:02.580 align:start position:0%
pension and that that's conflicts with
 
01:50:05.090 --> 01:50:05.100 align:start position:0%
with federal law that says that people
 
01:50:06.830 --> 01:50:06.840 align:start position:0%
can do that you have to have at least 10
 
01:50:09.109 --> 01:50:09.119 align:start position:0%
years of service with nhrs to buy the
 
01:50:12.050 --> 01:50:12.060 align:start position:0%
prior military service and you can buy
 
01:50:14.470 --> 01:50:14.480 align:start position:0%
up to three years
 
01:50:17.930 --> 01:50:17.940 align:start position:0%
so this would strike out the provisions
 
01:50:20.030 --> 01:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
that are in conflict with federal law
 
01:50:21.649 --> 01:50:21.659 align:start position:0%
one of uh one of your colleagues
 
01:50:24.530 --> 01:50:24.540 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn a former member of
 
01:50:26.870 --> 01:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch pointed that out to
 
01:50:30.410 --> 01:50:30.420 align:start position:0%
us last year so we we haven't been in
 
01:50:32.689 --> 01:50:32.699 align:start position:0%
following the current law but we want to
 
01:50:37.310 --> 01:50:37.320 align:start position:0%
get it uh income Department with uh
 
01:50:40.010 --> 01:50:40.020 align:start position:0%
you know the federal statutes
 
01:50:43.129 --> 01:50:43.139 align:start position:0%
yeah representative since we're talking
 
01:50:45.290 --> 01:50:45.300 align:start position:0%
about service credits I if we can go
 
01:50:48.530 --> 01:50:48.540 align:start position:0%
back I just want to uh page two lines
 
01:50:50.750 --> 01:50:50.760 align:start position:0%
three and four it mentioned civilian
 
01:50:52.370 --> 01:50:52.380 align:start position:0%
national service Americorps and the
 
01:50:53.629 --> 01:50:53.639 align:start position:0%
Peace Corps
 
01:50:55.790 --> 01:50:55.800 align:start position:0%
would you mind just explaining sort of
 
01:50:57.590 --> 01:50:57.600 align:start position:0%
how that works because it almost feels
 
01:51:01.250 --> 01:51:01.260 align:start position:0%
similarly vague to what was there before
 
01:51:03.109 --> 01:51:03.119 align:start position:0%
and maybe we need to clarify that as
 
01:51:05.149 --> 01:51:05.159 align:start position:0%
well yeah that that was a provision that
 
01:51:06.830 --> 01:51:06.840 align:start position:0%
was added uh
 
01:51:10.790 --> 01:51:10.800 align:start position:0%
oh did you want to go yeah
 
01:51:12.770 --> 01:51:12.780 align:start position:0%
first I'll say I know when they're
 
01:51:14.689 --> 01:51:14.699 align:start position:0%
taking advantage of that information no
 
01:51:16.550 --> 01:51:16.560 align:start position:0%
one's asked for to buy service related
 
01:51:19.609 --> 01:51:19.619 align:start position:0%
to Peace Corps or ameriser but it does
 
01:51:22.070 --> 01:51:22.080 align:start position:0%
date date back quite uh please we can't
 
01:51:27.830 --> 01:51:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:32.629 --> 01:51:32.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:34.910 --> 01:51:34.920 align:start position:0%
um it is a provision that was put in in
 
01:51:36.770 --> 01:51:36.780 align:start position:0%
quite a few years ago
 
01:51:41.149 --> 01:51:41.159 align:start position:0%
uh it was modified uh
 
01:51:43.669 --> 01:51:43.679 align:start position:0%
about five years ago in terms of how the
 
01:51:46.370 --> 01:51:46.380 align:start position:0%
cost of it would be calculated but
 
01:51:48.709 --> 01:51:48.719 align:start position:0%
basically says if you go off to Peace
 
01:51:50.510 --> 01:51:50.520 align:start position:0%
Corps Service for a couple years and
 
01:51:52.729 --> 01:51:52.739 align:start position:0%
come back you can buy that two years of
 
01:51:54.770 --> 01:51:54.780 align:start position:0%
service and add it to your service if
 
01:51:56.450 --> 01:51:56.460 align:start position:0%
you come back to your job in the system
 
01:51:59.209 --> 01:51:59.219 align:start position:0%
quite similar to the military the
 
01:52:01.189 --> 01:52:01.199 align:start position:0%
military one is different in that you
 
01:52:03.950 --> 01:52:03.960 align:start position:0%
have you Sarah the uniform Service Act
 
01:52:06.470 --> 01:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
it's a federal statute it says if you go
 
01:52:08.810 --> 01:52:08.820 align:start position:0%
leave your job to go back into military
 
01:52:11.689 --> 01:52:11.699 align:start position:0%
service they have to hold that job for
 
01:52:13.689 --> 01:52:13.699 align:start position:0%
you and
 
01:52:16.609 --> 01:52:16.619 align:start position:0%
allow you to buy time so you maintain
 
01:52:18.609 --> 01:52:18.619 align:start position:0%
your seniority and your service credit
 
01:52:22.250 --> 01:52:22.260 align:start position:0%
it doesn't require that uh
 
01:52:25.310 --> 01:52:25.320 align:start position:0%
that the plan give any free time you can
 
01:52:27.169 --> 01:52:27.179 align:start position:0%
charge the person the full cost we have
 
01:52:29.450 --> 01:52:29.460 align:start position:0%
a statute that we interpreted to say
 
01:52:32.450 --> 01:52:32.460 align:start position:0%
that cumulatively up to three years of
 
01:52:34.010 --> 01:52:34.020 align:start position:0%
service would be free and then the
 
01:52:35.570 --> 01:52:35.580 align:start position:0%
member could pay for any additional
 
01:52:37.669 --> 01:52:37.679 align:start position:0%
years of service
 
01:52:40.129 --> 01:52:40.139 align:start position:0%
uh one reason we changed this is it was
 
01:52:43.129 --> 01:52:43.139 align:start position:0%
ambiguous and in fact on Tuesday our
 
01:52:45.350 --> 01:52:45.360 align:start position:0%
board upheld a recommendation of our
 
01:52:47.330 --> 01:52:47.340 align:start position:0%
hearings examiner that the three years
 
01:52:49.729 --> 01:52:49.739 align:start position:0%
is per deployment because a member had
 
01:52:52.250 --> 01:52:52.260 align:start position:0%
argued he had four different deployments
 
01:52:54.050 --> 01:52:54.060 align:start position:0%
that added up to by five years of
 
01:52:55.550 --> 01:52:55.560 align:start position:0%
service he said I should get three years
 
01:52:58.129 --> 01:52:58.139 align:start position:0%
for each time I was deployed and because
 
01:53:00.709 --> 01:53:00.719 align:start position:0%
of the strict statutory construction and
 
01:53:02.510 --> 01:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
the ambiguity the hearings examined a
 
01:53:05.149 --> 01:53:05.159 align:start position:0%
recommended to the board that they that
 
01:53:08.149 --> 01:53:08.159 align:start position:0%
they uh allow this person to get what
 
01:53:10.010 --> 01:53:10.020 align:start position:0%
amounted to almost five years of free
 
01:53:12.590 --> 01:53:12.600 align:start position:0%
service that's contrary to how we had
 
01:53:14.930 --> 01:53:14.940 align:start position:0%
been applying it before so it's very
 
01:53:17.390 --> 01:53:17.400 align:start position:0%
germane now to correct this three years
 
01:53:20.390 --> 01:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
is very high amount for free service a
 
01:53:23.689 --> 01:53:23.699 align:start position:0%
lot of states don't give any free
 
01:53:26.090 --> 01:53:26.100 align:start position:0%
service some give some free service if
 
01:53:28.250 --> 01:53:28.260 align:start position:0%
you win a certain medal for Valor or
 
01:53:29.810 --> 01:53:29.820 align:start position:0%
this or that
 
01:53:31.790 --> 01:53:31.800 align:start position:0%
um there are different constructs three
 
01:53:34.070 --> 01:53:34.080 align:start position:0%
years is one of the highest ones and we
 
01:53:35.629 --> 01:53:35.639 align:start position:0%
just wanted to put a long-standing
 
01:53:37.370 --> 01:53:37.380 align:start position:0%
practice into places especially in light
 
01:53:39.590 --> 01:53:39.600 align:start position:0%
of we knew this hearing was coming down
 
01:53:41.810 --> 01:53:41.820 align:start position:0%
the pike
 
01:53:45.109 --> 01:53:45.119 align:start position:0%
as far as the provision uh
 
01:53:47.689 --> 01:53:47.699 align:start position:0%
uh that was against the law so to speak
 
01:53:50.450 --> 01:53:50.460 align:start position:0%
that was brought to our attention by a
 
01:53:52.129 --> 01:53:52.139 align:start position:0%
former New Hampshire Supreme Court
 
01:53:54.530 --> 01:53:54.540 align:start position:0%
Justice that there was a Rhode Island
 
01:53:57.970 --> 01:53:57.980 align:start position:0%
case two years ago that said you can't
 
01:54:02.570 --> 01:54:02.580 align:start position:0%
discriminate in granting benefits under
 
01:54:05.629 --> 01:54:05.639 align:start position:0%
a private pension or government pension
 
01:54:08.090 --> 01:54:08.100 align:start position:0%
because of someone's eligibility or
 
01:54:12.890 --> 01:54:12.900 align:start position:0%
receipt of a military pension that
 
01:54:15.890 --> 01:54:15.900 align:start position:0%
was in a Rhode Island District Court
 
01:54:17.629 --> 01:54:17.639 align:start position:0%
didn't come to our attention but it was
 
01:54:19.729 --> 01:54:19.739 align:start position:0%
also citing a California District Court
 
01:54:22.729 --> 01:54:22.739 align:start position:0%
decision that predated our statute so
 
01:54:24.709 --> 01:54:24.719 align:start position:0%
that provision our statute was wrong
 
01:54:27.169 --> 01:54:27.179 align:start position:0%
from the day it was enacted
 
01:54:29.629 --> 01:54:29.639 align:start position:0%
um and so that's why we wanted to take
 
01:54:34.189 --> 01:54:34.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:36.649 --> 01:54:36.659 align:start position:0%
the questions representative Schmidt so
 
01:54:38.510 --> 01:54:38.520 align:start position:0%
not to shortchange the committee but
 
01:54:40.550 --> 01:54:40.560 align:start position:0%
isn't this discussion a little bit more
 
01:54:42.709 --> 01:54:42.719 align:start position:0%
appropriate for the subcommittee since
 
01:54:45.109 --> 01:54:45.119 align:start position:0%
it's going to subcommittee uh we're
 
01:54:46.790 --> 01:54:46.800 align:start position:0%
getting into all the nitty-gritty that
 
01:54:48.169 --> 01:54:48.179 align:start position:0%
that's what the subcommittee is supposed
 
01:54:50.750 --> 01:54:50.760 align:start position:0%
to be doing and anybody who wants to sit
 
01:54:53.930 --> 01:54:53.940 align:start position:0%
in on that uh is welcome to do so yes
 
01:54:56.270 --> 01:54:56.280 align:start position:0%
thank you representative this is going
 
01:54:59.330 --> 01:54:59.340 align:start position:0%
to the to the pension subcommittee it is
 
01:55:02.390 --> 01:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
a it is a little bit more than uh
 
01:55:05.229 --> 01:55:05.239 align:start position:0%
technical cleanup it is yeah
 
01:55:08.450 --> 01:55:08.460 align:start position:0%
this is a policy that's a policy
 
01:55:11.570 --> 01:55:11.580 align:start position:0%
decision to say it's three cumulative
 
01:55:15.470 --> 01:55:15.480 align:start position:0%
rather than three per deployment
 
01:55:16.850 --> 01:55:16.860 align:start position:0%
um if I could just finish up the two
 
01:55:19.129 --> 01:55:19.139 align:start position:0%
these 10x2 I think should be simple and
 
01:55:22.490 --> 01:55:22.500 align:start position:0%
then I'll call it a day for for this
 
01:55:25.070 --> 01:55:25.080 align:start position:0%
um section seven and eight they both
 
01:55:27.050 --> 01:55:27.060 align:start position:0%
um they're actually redundant language
 
01:55:29.090 --> 01:55:29.100 align:start position:0%
in the statute and it just removes the
 
01:55:32.270 --> 01:55:32.280 align:start position:0%
Redundant language that is a cleanup one
 
01:55:35.209 --> 01:55:35.219 align:start position:0%
um and then the last one is really
 
01:55:39.050 --> 01:55:39.060 align:start position:0%
simple uh section nine there are a
 
01:55:40.790 --> 01:55:40.800 align:start position:0%
number of places
 
01:55:40.800 --> 01:55:42.109 align:start position:0%
number of places
um

01:55:42.109 --> 01:55:42.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:44.629 --> 01:55:44.639 align:start position:0%
that stated that the you know some work
 
01:55:47.570 --> 01:55:47.580 align:start position:0%
that the retirement system did had to uh
 
01:55:49.550 --> 01:55:49.560 align:start position:0%
comply with a particular government
 
01:55:52.010 --> 01:55:52.020 align:start position:0%
Standards Board and the name of that
 
01:55:54.830 --> 01:55:54.840 align:start position:0%
government Standards Board changed and
 
01:55:59.450 --> 01:55:59.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:02.450 --> 01:56:02.460 align:start position:0%
and uh are there any any questions any
 
01:56:05.470 --> 01:56:05.480 align:start position:0%
other questions representative O'Brien
 
01:56:08.450 --> 01:56:08.460 align:start position:0%
yes just uh thinking putting my
 
01:56:11.209 --> 01:56:11.219 align:start position:0%
Municipal hat on the effective date 60
 
01:56:14.629 --> 01:56:14.639 align:start position:0%
days after passage uh do you feel that's
 
01:56:17.890 --> 01:56:17.900 align:start position:0%
adequate for the contributing
 
01:56:21.290 --> 01:56:21.300 align:start position:0%
uh subdivisions to get up to speed with
 
01:56:23.209 --> 01:56:23.219 align:start position:0%
us these
 
01:56:25.189 --> 01:56:25.199 align:start position:0%
um these changes wouldn't affect any
 
01:56:27.470 --> 01:56:27.480 align:start position:0%
reporting from the participating
 
01:56:30.050 --> 01:56:30.060 align:start position:0%
employers or any contribution or things
 
01:56:31.550 --> 01:56:31.560 align:start position:0%
like that they're more sort of
 
01:56:34.729 --> 01:56:34.739 align:start position:0%
individual Case by case uh changes or
 
01:56:36.169 --> 01:56:36.179 align:start position:0%
they just have no impact like they're
 
01:56:38.870 --> 01:56:38.880 align:start position:0%
removing their redundant language so we
 
01:56:41.090 --> 01:56:41.100 align:start position:0%
don't believe there's any programming or
 
01:56:44.810 --> 01:56:44.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:46.550 --> 01:56:46.560 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
01:56:46.560 --> 01:56:47.689 align:start position:0%
other questions
okay

01:56:47.689 --> 01:56:47.699 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:56:50.030 --> 01:56:50.040 align:start position:0%
thank you that will in fact be going to
 
01:56:52.970 --> 01:56:52.980 align:start position:0%

01:56:52.980 --> 01:56:54.290 align:start position:0%
the pension subcommittee for uh further
analysis

01:56:54.290 --> 01:56:54.300 align:start position:0%
analysis
 
01:56:56.510 --> 01:56:56.520 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to
 
01:56:59.330 --> 01:56:59.340 align:start position:0%

um and uh I want to thank uh
 
01:57:43.910 --> 01:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
representative lakis for uh submitting
 
01:57:45.950 --> 01:57:45.960 align:start position:0%
um the amendment that we
 
01:57:48.770 --> 01:57:48.780 align:start position:0%
requested to O to OLS
 
01:57:48.780 --> 01:57:49.430 align:start position:0%
requested to O to OLS
um

01:57:49.430 --> 01:57:49.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:52.370 --> 01:57:52.380 align:start position:0%
I did hear that the uh the chair
 
01:57:54.350 --> 01:57:54.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned that you are going to send it
 
01:57:55.970 --> 01:57:55.980 align:start position:0%
to a subcommittee
 
01:58:00.109 --> 01:58:00.119 align:start position:0%
um and so you know I'm happy to go this
 
01:58:03.950 --> 01:58:03.960 align:start position:0%
is fairly brief but uh I had I do have I
 
01:58:06.649 --> 01:58:06.659 align:start position:0%
did bring some copies of a Word document
 
01:58:08.930 --> 01:58:08.940 align:start position:0%
Amendment if you would like me to hand
 
01:58:11.030 --> 01:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
that out for reference or I can save
 
01:58:21.589 --> 01:58:21.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:24.350 --> 01:58:24.360 align:start position:0%
that will help us understand the intent
 
01:58:27.830 --> 01:58:27.840 align:start position:0%
and it's likely the exact the language
 
01:58:31.370 --> 01:58:31.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:33.770 --> 01:58:33.780 align:start position:0%
yes and and the language would be very
 
01:58:36.169 --> 01:58:36.179 align:start position:0%
similar I don't it would not change the
 
01:58:38.570 --> 01:58:38.580 align:start position:0%
intent of what the retirement system was
 
01:58:41.570 --> 01:58:41.580 align:start position:0%
trying to do I I did have a we did talk
 
01:58:44.209 --> 01:58:44.219 align:start position:0%
to the retirement system
 
01:58:46.430 --> 01:58:46.440 align:start position:0%
um and um our understanding is that they
 
01:58:49.070 --> 01:58:49.080 align:start position:0%
have no issue with the change
 
01:58:52.669 --> 01:58:52.679 align:start position:0%
um the first uh you'll see is when in
 
01:58:55.550 --> 01:58:55.560 align:start position:0%
the Amendments uh to the to
 
01:58:57.310 --> 01:58:57.320 align:start position:0%
excuse me on the bill
 
01:59:00.189 --> 01:59:00.199 align:start position:0%
on on page one
 
01:59:04.250 --> 01:59:04.260 align:start position:0%
line nine it would change the tense of
 
01:59:07.570 --> 01:59:07.580 align:start position:0%
designates to designated
 
01:59:12.589 --> 01:59:12.599 align:start position:0%
and the purpose of that is to uh you
 
01:59:16.250 --> 01:59:16.260 align:start position:0%
know the the designation of job share is
 
01:59:19.790 --> 01:59:19.800 align:start position:0%
is the employers and the and the purpose
 
01:59:22.609 --> 01:59:22.619 align:start position:0%
of that is just to clarify that
 
01:59:25.629 --> 01:59:25.639 align:start position:0%
um when the employer makes that
 
01:59:29.570 --> 01:59:29.580 align:start position:0%
designation further down the road
 
01:59:32.570 --> 01:59:32.580 align:start position:0%
um you know two years from now uh which
 
01:59:35.330 --> 01:59:35.340 align:start position:0%
was a situation that did happen or
 
01:59:38.089 --> 01:59:38.099 align:start position:0%
attempted to happen that uh you know
 
01:59:39.830 --> 01:59:39.840 align:start position:0%
somebody who's been paying into the
 
01:59:41.089 --> 01:59:41.099 align:start position:0%
system and the employer has been making
 
01:59:43.129 --> 01:59:43.139 align:start position:0%
those contributions that that was for
 
01:59:44.689 --> 01:59:44.699 align:start position:0%
for that semester that was the
 
01:59:46.370 --> 01:59:46.380 align:start position:0%
designation for that position of course
 
01:59:48.250 --> 01:59:48.260 align:start position:0%
the employer can change that in the next
 
01:59:50.870 --> 01:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
uh semester it could be changed to a
 
01:59:53.390 --> 01:59:53.400 align:start position:0%
part-time situation which is not uh
 
01:59:55.010 --> 01:59:55.020 align:start position:0%
which which may not be you know a
 
01:59:56.570 --> 01:59:56.580 align:start position:0%
pensionable position in the retirement
 
01:59:56.580 --> 01:59:57.530 align:start position:0%
pensionable position in the retirement
system

01:59:57.530 --> 01:59:57.540 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:59:59.570 --> 01:59:59.580 align:start position:0%
so that there's the tense change there
 
02:00:01.729 --> 02:00:01.739 align:start position:0%
the second change
 
02:00:05.089 --> 02:00:05.099 align:start position:0%
um is uh and I apologize that this is
 
02:00:07.550 --> 02:00:07.560 align:start position:0%
not in color I bet Anya New Hampshire
 
02:00:09.229 --> 02:00:09.239 align:start position:0%
for three years and apparently they
 
02:00:10.370 --> 02:00:10.380 align:start position:0%
haven't given me color position
 
02:00:13.129 --> 02:00:13.139 align:start position:0%
permissions on the uh on the printer yet
 
02:00:13.139 --> 02:00:14.209 align:start position:0%
permissions on the uh on the printer yet
but

02:00:14.209 --> 02:00:14.219 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:00:16.790 --> 02:00:16.800 align:start position:0%
uh the the additional languages period
 
02:00:19.910 --> 02:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
what's that it's a 10-year vest yes
 
02:00:23.270 --> 02:00:23.280 align:start position:0%
10-year vesting on color permissions
 
02:00:25.910 --> 02:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
uh I think that may be in the law too I
 
02:00:27.290 --> 02:00:27.300 align:start position:0%
don't know uh
 
02:00:31.790 --> 02:00:31.800 align:start position:0%
so this this would uh apply to
 
02:00:31.800 --> 02:00:32.510 align:start position:0%
so this this would uh apply to
um

02:00:32.510 --> 02:00:32.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:35.089 --> 02:00:35.099 align:start position:0%
on line 10 of the bill
 
02:00:38.089 --> 02:00:38.099 align:start position:0%
um where it says scheduled to work 50 of
 
02:00:40.490 --> 02:00:40.500 align:start position:0%
the regularly scheduled days this would
 
02:00:43.070 --> 02:00:43.080 align:start position:0%
add or hours and the purpose of that is
 
02:00:45.169 --> 02:00:45.179 align:start position:0%
is more to just clearly reflect the
 
02:00:47.390 --> 02:00:47.400 align:start position:0%
nature that is some job shares which
 
02:00:48.830 --> 02:00:48.840 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
02:00:51.229 --> 02:00:51.239 align:start position:0%
working on your work on Monday I work on
 
02:00:53.810 --> 02:00:53.820 align:start position:0%
Tuesday it may be a situation where you
 
02:00:56.390 --> 02:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
have you know two working moms who
 
02:00:59.990 --> 02:01:00.000 align:start position:0%

position for example in the morning and
 
02:01:05.089 --> 02:01:05.099 align:start position:0%
then someone else in the afternoon so
 
02:01:07.490 --> 02:01:07.500 align:start position:0%
that's more just to make it clear that
 
02:01:10.070 --> 02:01:10.080 align:start position:0%
we're we're not just talking about uh
 
02:01:14.629 --> 02:01:14.639 align:start position:0%

03:32:10.910 --> 03:32:10.920 align:start position:0%
thank representative the other
 
03:32:12.889 --> 03:32:12.899 align:start position:0%
representative leckis for covering me in
 
03:32:14.389 --> 03:32:14.399 align:start position:0%
the other
 
03:32:14.399 --> 03:32:16.010 align:start position:0%
the other
committee

03:32:16.010 --> 03:32:16.020 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:32:17.750 --> 03:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
so for the record iron state
 
03:32:19.610 --> 03:32:19.620 align:start position:0%
representative Mike Moffett representing
 
03:32:22.250 --> 03:32:22.260 align:start position:0%
Merrimack District 4 in the beautiful
 
03:32:26.630 --> 03:32:26.640 align:start position:0%
towns of Canterbury and Loudoun
 
03:32:29.269 --> 03:32:29.279 align:start position:0%
so Calvin Coolidge who most of you have
 
03:32:31.250 --> 03:32:31.260 align:start position:0%
heard of uh famously once said
 
03:32:34.490 --> 03:32:34.500 align:start position:0%
persistence is omnipotent and his point
 
03:32:37.429 --> 03:32:37.439 align:start position:0%
was that uh stay with things don't give
 
03:32:39.830 --> 03:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
up in fact Winston Churchill in the most
 
03:32:39.840 --> 03:32:41.950 align:start position:0%
up in fact Winston Churchill in the most
famous

03:32:41.950 --> 03:32:41.960 align:start position:0%
famous
 
03:32:44.630 --> 03:32:44.640 align:start position:0%
commencement speech ever was three words
 
03:32:46.309 --> 03:32:46.319 align:start position:0%
don't give up and that's why I'm here
 
03:32:49.130 --> 03:32:49.140 align:start position:0%
today we've had this measure before
 
03:32:51.110 --> 03:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
and uh it's back for a good reason
 
03:32:52.729 --> 03:32:52.739 align:start position:0%
because a lot of folks are hoping that
 
03:32:55.190 --> 03:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
it would come back so here we are
 
03:32:55.200 --> 03:32:56.830 align:start position:0%
it would come back so here we are
um

03:32:56.830 --> 03:32:56.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:32:59.330 --> 03:32:59.340 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Amendment concurrent
 
03:33:02.690 --> 03:33:02.700 align:start position:0%
resolution one cacr1 is a measure
 
03:33:04.309 --> 03:33:04.319 align:start position:0%
establishing a lieutenant governor
 
03:33:07.790 --> 03:33:07.800 align:start position:0%
position for the State of New Hampshire
 
03:33:09.769 --> 03:33:09.779 align:start position:0%
so and I have sent my testimony to the
 
03:33:12.950 --> 03:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
committee already and I have
 
03:33:15.290 --> 03:33:15.300 align:start position:0%
um also forwarded on a former
 
03:33:17.030 --> 03:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
representative sent me some information
 
03:33:19.910 --> 03:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
about Lieutenant Governors which I've
 
03:33:21.590 --> 03:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
also sent to you all as well maybe some
 
03:33:23.269 --> 03:33:23.279 align:start position:0%
of you a chance to look at it and if you
 
03:33:25.070 --> 03:33:25.080 align:start position:0%
haven't uh it's in your both of those
 
03:33:27.469 --> 03:33:27.479 align:start position:0%
are in your inboxes
 
03:33:30.469 --> 03:33:30.479 align:start position:0%
so uh currently 43 states have
 
03:33:32.330 --> 03:33:32.340 align:start position:0%
Lieutenant governors
 
03:33:35.389 --> 03:33:35.399 align:start position:0%
now I know that is not a reason for us
 
03:33:37.309 --> 03:33:37.319 align:start position:0%
necessarily to do this just because
 
03:33:39.290 --> 03:33:39.300 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts does anything doesn't
 
03:33:41.809 --> 03:33:41.819 align:start position:0%
necessarily mean that we need to uh
 
03:33:44.990 --> 03:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
follow in their footsteps but
 
03:33:47.389 --> 03:33:47.399 align:start position:0%
um there are there's a strong case for
 
03:33:50.090 --> 03:33:50.100 align:start position:0%
uh given giving this serious
 
03:33:52.429 --> 03:33:52.439 align:start position:0%
consideration which I hope uh is the
 
03:33:52.439 --> 03:33:53.290 align:start position:0%
consideration which I hope uh is the
case

03:33:53.290 --> 03:33:53.300 align:start position:0%
case
 
03:33:56.269 --> 03:33:56.279 align:start position:0%
constitutionally a current line of
 
03:33:58.010 --> 03:33:58.020 align:start position:0%
succession calls for the state senate
 
03:33:58.020 --> 03:33:59.090 align:start position:0%
succession calls for the state senate
president

03:33:59.090 --> 03:33:59.100 align:start position:0%
president
 
03:34:01.550 --> 03:34:01.560 align:start position:0%
to replace the governor and this has
 
03:34:03.889 --> 03:34:03.899 align:start position:0%
happened several times most recently in
 
03:34:03.899 --> 03:34:05.330 align:start position:0%
happened several times most recently in
2016

03:34:05.330 --> 03:34:05.340 align:start position:0%
2016
 
03:34:07.750 --> 03:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
when Senate President Chuck Morse
 
03:34:11.330 --> 03:34:11.340 align:start position:0%
replaced uh Governor Maggie hasson
 
03:34:15.050 --> 03:34:15.060 align:start position:0%
briefly when she was sworn in to be a
 
03:34:17.330 --> 03:34:17.340 align:start position:0%
U.S senator
 
03:34:19.610 --> 03:34:19.620 align:start position:0%
Senate President Ralph Howe
 
03:34:21.530 --> 03:34:21.540 align:start position:0%
which some of you may remember from he's
 
03:34:23.630 --> 03:34:23.640 align:start position:0%
from Lebanon he replaced Judd Gregg in
 
03:34:27.650 --> 03:34:27.660 align:start position:0%
1992 briefly same reason when uh
 
03:34:29.809 --> 03:34:29.819 align:start position:0%
Judd Gregg was um
 
03:34:33.530 --> 03:34:33.540 align:start position:0%
sworn in as a U.S senator but please
 
03:34:37.550 --> 03:34:37.560 align:start position:0%
Ponder what happened in 1982
 
03:34:41.269 --> 03:34:41.279 align:start position:0%
when Senate President Vesta Roy was
 
03:34:43.550 --> 03:34:43.560 align:start position:0%
sworn in as acting Governor after the
 
03:34:47.530 --> 03:34:47.540 align:start position:0%
death of of you gallon of Littleton
 
03:34:50.570 --> 03:34:50.580 align:start position:0%
so these two individuals Governor Gowan
 
03:34:52.070 --> 03:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
and Senator Vester lawyer of different
 
03:34:52.080 --> 03:34:53.450 align:start position:0%
and Senator Vester lawyer of different
priorities

03:34:53.450 --> 03:34:53.460 align:start position:0%
priorities
 
03:34:55.670 --> 03:34:55.680 align:start position:0%
and that's uh could have been
 
03:34:58.070 --> 03:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
problematical had Governor gallon won
 
03:35:01.070 --> 03:35:01.080 align:start position:0%
re-election against John sununo
 
03:35:03.650 --> 03:35:03.660 align:start position:0%
um and passed away later in the term we
 
03:35:07.550 --> 03:35:07.560 align:start position:0%
would have had a uh a Republican
 
03:35:10.790 --> 03:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
uh speak a Republican senator Senate
 
03:35:13.550 --> 03:35:13.560 align:start position:0%
President replacing a a Democratic
 
03:35:13.560 --> 03:35:15.229 align:start position:0%
President replacing a a Democratic
governor

03:35:15.229 --> 03:35:15.239 align:start position:0%
governor
 
03:35:18.830 --> 03:35:18.840 align:start position:0%
and that just is a problem and it's a
 
03:35:22.010 --> 03:35:22.020 align:start position:0%
problem for uh for all kind
 
03:35:25.250 --> 03:35:25.260 align:start position:0%
of S Marine for all concerned and
 
03:35:27.650 --> 03:35:27.660 align:start position:0%
this measure that you have in front of
 
03:35:31.910 --> 03:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
you is a non-partisan measure because in
 
03:35:34.610 --> 03:35:34.620 align:start position:0%
the future we just don't know uh who
 
03:35:36.650 --> 03:35:36.660 align:start position:0%
will be in which positions it's
 
03:35:39.170 --> 03:35:39.180 align:start position:0%
non-partisan also bipartisan uh the last
 
03:35:41.330 --> 03:35:41.340 align:start position:0%
time this came through I had a couple uh
 
03:35:43.330 --> 03:35:43.340 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors who are now in the Senate
 
03:35:46.429 --> 03:35:46.439 align:start position:0%
interestingly uh but my my three
 
03:35:48.110 --> 03:35:48.120 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors this time around are from
 
03:35:50.510 --> 03:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
the other party so this is true this is
 
03:35:53.469 --> 03:35:53.479 align:start position:0%
a constitutional issue and it's truly
 
03:35:56.510 --> 03:35:56.520 align:start position:0%
bipartisan and non-partisan
 
03:35:59.330 --> 03:35:59.340 align:start position:0%
so to have a president Senate President
 
03:36:01.190 --> 03:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
one party replace
 
03:36:03.229 --> 03:36:03.239 align:start position:0%
a government of another party creates
 
03:36:05.090 --> 03:36:05.100 align:start position:0%
potentially many issues and I I've
 
03:36:07.130 --> 03:36:07.140 align:start position:0%
emailed my testimony to you all as well
 
03:36:08.690 --> 03:36:08.700 align:start position:0%
as well as some information about how
 
03:36:10.250 --> 03:36:10.260 align:start position:0%
other states do lieutenant governor
 
03:36:14.389 --> 03:36:14.399 align:start position:0%
issues so were this to happen and it has
 
03:36:15.830 --> 03:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
happened in the past I just gave you
 
03:36:18.010 --> 03:36:18.020 align:start position:0%
three examples but those are very brief
 
03:36:21.530 --> 03:36:21.540 align:start position:0%
uh short-term situations what if this
 
03:36:23.809 --> 03:36:23.819 align:start position:0%
happened midterm and that's something
 
03:36:27.830 --> 03:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
that is very very important and very
 
03:36:29.809 --> 03:36:29.819 align:start position:0%
significant we've been lucky that we
 
03:36:31.910 --> 03:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
haven't had this come up before so I
 
03:36:34.969 --> 03:36:34.979 align:start position:0%
just really needs to be looked at
 
03:36:36.950 --> 03:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
so if a new governor came in would the
 
03:36:39.229 --> 03:36:39.239 align:start position:0%
new governor replace existing staff
 
03:36:40.790 --> 03:36:40.800 align:start position:0%
that's a good question would the new
 
03:36:42.530 --> 03:36:42.540 align:start position:0%
governor from the other party
 
03:36:46.190 --> 03:36:46.200 align:start position:0%
bring his or her people in or not or or
 
03:36:48.590 --> 03:36:48.600 align:start position:0%
have a hybrid who knows it's it's very
 
03:36:51.530 --> 03:36:51.540 align:start position:0%
unwieldy and here's the biggest nub or
 
03:36:53.510 --> 03:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
the thing that really needs to be
 
03:36:55.670 --> 03:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
pondered and considered and it's
 
03:36:58.729 --> 03:36:58.739 align:start position:0%
extremely significant that it needs to
 
03:37:00.110 --> 03:37:00.120 align:start position:0%
be addressed
 
03:37:02.929 --> 03:37:02.939 align:start position:0%
how can you have the
 
03:37:05.990 --> 03:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
the leader of a legislative branch the
 
03:37:08.630 --> 03:37:08.640 align:start position:0%
Senate President concurrently at the
 
03:37:10.309 --> 03:37:10.319 align:start position:0%
same time become the leader of the
 
03:37:13.250 --> 03:37:13.260 align:start position:0%
executive branch again I'm the guy who
 
03:37:14.809 --> 03:37:14.819 align:start position:0%
got the two Civics bills to the
 
03:37:16.610 --> 03:37:16.620 align:start position:0%
governor's desk I used to teach this
 
03:37:19.429 --> 03:37:19.439 align:start position:0%
stuff and it's it's important and I
 
03:37:22.550 --> 03:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
asked I ask again how can you have a
 
03:37:25.309 --> 03:37:25.319 align:start position:0%
lead in New Hampshire leader this is
 
03:37:28.010 --> 03:37:28.020 align:start position:0%
separation of powers issues how can you
 
03:37:29.570 --> 03:37:29.580 align:start position:0%
have the Senate President also be the
 
03:37:31.250 --> 03:37:31.260 align:start position:0%
head of the executive branch and that's
 
03:37:33.590 --> 03:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
the situation we have now it's untenable
 
03:37:35.750 --> 03:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
it just needs to be talked about I'm
 
03:37:37.130 --> 03:37:37.140 align:start position:0%
surprised it hasn't been talked about
 
03:37:37.140 --> 03:37:38.809 align:start position:0%
surprised it hasn't been talked about
before

03:37:38.809 --> 03:37:38.819 align:start position:0%
before
 
03:37:38.819 --> 03:37:39.410 align:start position:0%
before
um

03:37:39.410 --> 03:37:39.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:41.690 --> 03:37:41.700 align:start position:0%
I did bring this measure to committee
 
03:37:43.670 --> 03:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
before as I said it received some
 
03:37:45.410 --> 03:37:45.420 align:start position:0%
support I noticed from both sides of the
 
03:37:47.269 --> 03:37:47.279 align:start position:0%
aisle then but not enough to move it
 
03:37:49.250 --> 03:37:49.260 align:start position:0%
forward so I'll try to present it better
 
03:37:51.110 --> 03:37:51.120 align:start position:0%
this time around
 
03:37:51.120 --> 03:37:53.210 align:start position:0%
this time around
so

03:37:53.210 --> 03:37:53.220 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:37:56.030 --> 03:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
as I said the subtle the current
 
03:37:58.490 --> 03:37:58.500 align:start position:0%
uh structure we have utterly goes
 
03:38:01.250 --> 03:38:01.260 align:start position:0%
against uh separation powers in civics
 
03:38:04.370 --> 03:38:04.380 align:start position:0%
101. so Ponder what would have happened
 
03:38:08.570 --> 03:38:08.580 align:start position:0%
in 2019 or 2020 had God forbid heaven
 
03:38:11.090 --> 03:38:11.100 align:start position:0%
forbid governor of sonuna would have
 
03:38:14.510 --> 03:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
been say struck by lightning uh Senate
 
03:38:16.490 --> 03:38:16.500 align:start position:0%
President Donna Souci at the time would
 
03:38:19.849 --> 03:38:19.859 align:start position:0%
have taken over to his office to finish
 
03:38:22.490 --> 03:38:22.500 align:start position:0%
out his term that's what we have in
 
03:38:23.510 --> 03:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
place now
 
03:38:25.490 --> 03:38:25.500 align:start position:0%
so again what would she have done with
 
03:38:27.290 --> 03:38:27.300 align:start position:0%
the staff would she have like fired his
 
03:38:29.030 --> 03:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
people brought her own people in I don't
 
03:38:31.429 --> 03:38:31.439 align:start position:0%
know but something that uh is a question
 
03:38:35.690 --> 03:38:35.700 align:start position:0%
that needs to be pondered
 
03:38:37.309 --> 03:38:37.319 align:start position:0%
um what would have happened with regard
 
03:38:39.469 --> 03:38:39.479 align:start position:0%
to running the Senate she's the Senate
 
03:38:42.170 --> 03:38:42.180 align:start position:0%
President is she not going to run the
 
03:38:43.490 --> 03:38:43.500 align:start position:0%
Senate anymore she's not going to vote
 
03:38:45.830 --> 03:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
in the Senate while she's running the
 
03:38:47.870 --> 03:38:47.880 align:start position:0%
state because she would be sworn in as
 
03:38:50.590 --> 03:38:50.600 align:start position:0%
the governor I mean
 
03:38:54.349 --> 03:38:54.359 align:start position:0%
seriously what would have happened now
 
03:38:56.870 --> 03:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
that's what Senators Roy Huffman Morse
 
03:38:58.490 --> 03:38:58.500 align:start position:0%
did but they again they were only in
 
03:39:00.170 --> 03:39:00.180 align:start position:0%
there for the short term
 
03:39:04.490 --> 03:39:04.500 align:start position:0%
and further in 2019 to 2020 is most all
 
03:39:09.229 --> 03:39:09.239 align:start position:0%
of you will will recall uh one party had
 
03:39:11.809 --> 03:39:11.819 align:start position:0%
both U.S senators had both Congress
 
03:39:14.690 --> 03:39:14.700 align:start position:0%
people had the state senate had the
 
03:39:16.790 --> 03:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
State House of Representatives had the
 
03:39:19.969 --> 03:39:19.979 align:start position:0%
executive Council and if the party would
 
03:39:21.950 --> 03:39:21.960 align:start position:0%
at that point also get in the governor
 
03:39:24.050 --> 03:39:24.060 align:start position:0%
we would have a situation in this purple
 
03:39:27.170 --> 03:39:27.180 align:start position:0%
state where one party would have
 
03:39:29.809 --> 03:39:29.819 align:start position:0%
controlled every single part of state
 
03:39:32.269 --> 03:39:32.279 align:start position:0%
government now the reverse situation was
 
03:39:35.690 --> 03:39:35.700 align:start position:0%
true in 1982 when Governor Gallen died
 
03:39:37.790 --> 03:39:37.800 align:start position:0%
and was replaced by Senate President
 
03:39:39.469 --> 03:39:39.479 align:start position:0%
investor Roy at that time the
 
03:39:41.750 --> 03:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
Republicans pretty much controlled every
 
03:39:45.769 --> 03:39:45.779 align:start position:0%
part of the government and and we would
 
03:39:48.590 --> 03:39:48.600 align:start position:0%
have had a uh reverse situation that's
 
03:39:50.330 --> 03:39:50.340 align:start position:0%
why this is a very non-partisan and
 
03:39:50.340 --> 03:39:51.769 align:start position:0%
why this is a very non-partisan and
bipartisan

03:39:51.769 --> 03:39:51.779 align:start position:0%
bipartisan
 
03:39:51.779 --> 03:39:54.229 align:start position:0%
bipartisan
situation

03:39:54.229 --> 03:39:54.239 align:start position:0%
situation
 
03:39:56.570 --> 03:39:56.580 align:start position:0%
so New Hampshire is one of only two
 
03:39:58.490 --> 03:39:58.500 align:start position:0%
states that has a two-year term for
 
03:40:01.010 --> 03:40:01.020 align:start position:0%
governor that mitigates the problem the
 
03:40:04.130 --> 03:40:04.140 align:start position:0%
situation somewhat uh you know if it was
 
03:40:06.190 --> 03:40:06.200 align:start position:0%
a four-year term it'll be even worse
 
03:40:09.170 --> 03:40:09.180 align:start position:0%
even more compelling
 
03:40:11.450 --> 03:40:11.460 align:start position:0%
so Madam chairman is a potentially
 
03:40:13.550 --> 03:40:13.560 align:start position:0%
serious situation that's just not an
 
03:40:15.590 --> 03:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
issue in other states because most other
 
03:40:18.769 --> 03:40:18.779 align:start position:0%
states have a reasonable working line of
 
03:40:18.779 --> 03:40:20.510 align:start position:0%
states have a reasonable working line of
succession

03:40:20.510 --> 03:40:20.520 align:start position:0%
succession
 
03:40:25.190 --> 03:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
so uh I bring this forward I
 
03:40:28.190 --> 03:40:28.200 align:start position:0%
because it needs to be addressed and
 
03:40:29.750 --> 03:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
needs to be talked about
 
03:40:32.809 --> 03:40:32.819 align:start position:0%
and the proposal here in cacr1 is to do
 
03:40:34.309 --> 03:40:34.319 align:start position:0%
this though the New Hampshire as I call
 
03:40:36.950 --> 03:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
it the New Hampshire way uh we're all
 
03:40:41.510 --> 03:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
citizen legislators very proud of that
 
03:40:45.530 --> 03:40:45.540 align:start position:0%
and the proposal here uh
 
03:40:49.370 --> 03:40:49.380 align:start position:0%
is I think a very exciting proposal to
 
03:40:52.849 --> 03:40:52.859 align:start position:0%
have a citizen lieutenant governor
 
03:40:55.130 --> 03:40:55.140 align:start position:0%
a lot of the folks especially from my
 
03:40:57.469 --> 03:40:57.479 align:start position:0%
team have said to me you know uh you're
 
03:40:58.790 --> 03:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
growing government you know we don't
 
03:41:00.950 --> 03:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
want to grow government well no I I'm
 
03:41:02.630 --> 03:41:02.640 align:start position:0%
not a big on growing government
 
03:41:04.309 --> 03:41:04.319 align:start position:0%
government either
 
03:41:07.429 --> 03:41:07.439 align:start position:0%
but for 125 a year which is what the
 
03:41:09.490 --> 03:41:09.500 align:start position:0%
Senate President gets our citizen
 
03:41:12.110 --> 03:41:12.120 align:start position:0%
lieutenant governor which we would have
 
03:41:13.729 --> 03:41:13.739 align:start position:0%
if this moves forward out of this
 
03:41:15.590 --> 03:41:15.600 align:start position:0%
committee and goes to the Senate doesn't
 
03:41:16.849 --> 03:41:16.859 align:start position:0%
go to the as you know this doesn't go to
 
03:41:18.650 --> 03:41:18.660 align:start position:0%
the governor it goes to the people
 
03:41:22.030 --> 03:41:22.040 align:start position:0%
Governor it's a cacr and I I would hope
 
03:41:24.349 --> 03:41:24.359 align:start position:0%
obviously that this would go to the
 
03:41:26.150 --> 03:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
Senate and then to the people it'd be a
 
03:41:28.130 --> 03:41:28.140 align:start position:0%
wonderful civics lesson because there'd
 
03:41:29.870 --> 03:41:29.880 align:start position:0%
be a lot of discussion all over the
 
03:41:31.250 --> 03:41:31.260 align:start position:0%
state about the structure of our
 
03:41:32.870 --> 03:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
government a lot of people would learn
 
03:41:35.389 --> 03:41:35.399 align:start position:0%
some stuff and they get smarter
 
03:41:38.990 --> 03:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
so two government two Governors for the
 
03:41:41.210 --> 03:41:41.220 align:start position:0%
price of one essentially I think that
 
03:41:43.729 --> 03:41:43.739 align:start position:0%
that's not bigger government that's
 
03:41:46.130 --> 03:41:46.140 align:start position:0%
better government
 
03:41:49.150 --> 03:41:49.160 align:start position:0%
our governor gets countless
 
03:41:52.370 --> 03:41:52.380 align:start position:0%
invitations all the time more than he or
 
03:41:55.010 --> 03:41:55.020 align:start position:0%
she could ever begin to uh
 
03:41:57.190 --> 03:41:57.200 align:start position:0%
to respond to
 
03:42:00.050 --> 03:42:00.060 align:start position:0%
ribbon cuttings testimonials funerals
 
03:42:02.269 --> 03:42:02.279 align:start position:0%
School visits you know meeting people
 
03:42:05.269 --> 03:42:05.279 align:start position:0%
the governor is like a scheduler just to
 
03:42:07.630 --> 03:42:07.640 align:start position:0%
deal with his schedule or her schedule
 
03:42:10.250 --> 03:42:10.260 align:start position:0%
uh Lieutenant government would would
 
03:42:10.260 --> 03:42:11.630 align:start position:0%
uh Lieutenant government would would
double

03:42:11.630 --> 03:42:11.640 align:start position:0%
double
 
03:42:15.889 --> 03:42:15.899 align:start position:0%
the executive office's capacity to serve
 
03:42:18.650 --> 03:42:18.660 align:start position:0%
the people to to meet with these
 
03:42:21.050 --> 03:42:21.060 align:start position:0%
youngsters from the fourth graders who
 
03:42:22.790 --> 03:42:22.800 align:start position:0%
come here I mean I could go on and on
 
03:42:24.469 --> 03:42:24.479 align:start position:0%
and on and on about all the great things
 
03:42:26.630 --> 03:42:26.640 align:start position:0%
that a lieutenant a citizen lieutenant
 
03:42:28.790 --> 03:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
governor could do
 
03:42:31.490 --> 03:42:31.500 align:start position:0%
so again the uh I mentioned this is very
 
03:42:33.769 --> 03:42:33.779 align:start position:0%
non-partisan because we have no way of
 
03:42:36.050 --> 03:42:36.060 align:start position:0%
knowing who's going to be in power in
 
03:42:37.969 --> 03:42:37.979 align:start position:0%
the future so it's again some will argue
 
03:42:37.979 --> 03:42:39.650 align:start position:0%
the future so it's again some will argue
we've

03:42:39.650 --> 03:42:39.660 align:start position:0%
we've
 
03:42:43.130 --> 03:42:43.140 align:start position:0%
we've never done that before which
 
03:42:46.490 --> 03:42:46.500 align:start position:0%
I've heard and I uh I just understand
 
03:42:49.849 --> 03:42:49.859 align:start position:0%
that that that's a natural question for
 
03:42:51.830 --> 03:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
people to say we've got we've got along
 
03:42:53.990 --> 03:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
for 240 years without a lieutenant
 
03:42:55.250 --> 03:42:55.260 align:start position:0%
governor we've never done that before we
 
03:42:56.990 --> 03:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
don't need that well just because every
 
03:42:59.030 --> 03:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
other state has one doesn't mean that we
 
03:43:00.950 --> 03:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
need one but those are all flawed
 
03:43:03.349 --> 03:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
arguments in my opinion and hopefully
 
03:43:05.210 --> 03:43:05.220 align:start position:0%
when this measure goes to your executive
 
03:43:07.429 --> 03:43:07.439 align:start position:0%
session they can be appropriately
 
03:43:10.090 --> 03:43:10.100 align:start position:0%
discussed and refuted
 
03:43:13.010 --> 03:43:13.020 align:start position:0%
uh last time I was here two years ago
 
03:43:14.809 --> 03:43:14.819 align:start position:0%
there were some good questions as a
 
03:43:17.750 --> 03:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
former teacher Professor I know there's
 
03:43:19.490 --> 03:43:19.500 align:start position:0%
no such thing as bad questions but some
 
03:43:20.570 --> 03:43:20.580 align:start position:0%
of the questions that came up before
 
03:43:22.849 --> 03:43:22.859 align:start position:0%
some of you were here
 
03:43:22.859 --> 03:43:23.690 align:start position:0%
some of you were here
um

03:43:23.690 --> 03:43:23.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:43:25.969 --> 03:43:25.979 align:start position:0%
I was asked will the lieutenant governor
 
03:43:28.130 --> 03:43:28.140 align:start position:0%
have their own desk
 
03:43:29.750 --> 03:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
will the lieutenant governor have their
 
03:43:31.070 --> 03:43:31.080 align:start position:0%
own phone
 
03:43:32.570 --> 03:43:32.580 align:start position:0%
who's going to pay for the business
 
03:43:35.150 --> 03:43:35.160 align:start position:0%
cards for the new lieutenant governor
 
03:43:37.910 --> 03:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
those are all no such thing as a bad
 
03:43:39.910 --> 03:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
question those are all questions that's
 
03:43:42.830 --> 03:43:42.840 align:start position:0%
why we have these these hearings these
 
03:43:44.809 --> 03:43:44.819 align:start position:0%
questions come out and the answer is
 
03:43:47.870 --> 03:43:47.880 align:start position:0%
that the governor whoever he or she may
 
03:43:50.389 --> 03:43:50.399 align:start position:0%
be really would Define or determine how
 
03:43:51.769 --> 03:43:51.779 align:start position:0%
they want to use their lieutenant
 
03:43:53.870 --> 03:43:53.880 align:start position:0%
governor not unlike a president will
 
03:43:55.849 --> 03:43:55.859 align:start position:0%
make uh
 
03:43:59.750 --> 03:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh vice president tsar of whatever and I
 
03:44:01.790 --> 03:44:01.800 align:start position:0%
think it's very exciting I think uh
 
03:44:04.969 --> 03:44:04.979 align:start position:0%
Governors uh to have this help and to be
 
03:44:07.309 --> 03:44:07.319 align:start position:0%
able to assign all these things to a
 
03:44:10.070 --> 03:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
citizen lieutenant governor uh just
 
03:44:13.190 --> 03:44:13.200 align:start position:0%
would just make our government better
 
03:44:16.070 --> 03:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
more responsive better
 
03:44:16.080 --> 03:44:17.330 align:start position:0%
more responsive better
so

03:44:17.330 --> 03:44:17.340 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:44:19.729 --> 03:44:19.739 align:start position:0%
um and the answer is the governor would
 
03:44:21.830 --> 03:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
make that decision and and the
 
03:44:22.969 --> 03:44:22.979 align:start position:0%
lieutenant governor would work for the
 
03:44:25.370 --> 03:44:25.380 align:start position:0%
governor and for us and for the people
 
03:44:26.630 --> 03:44:26.640 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire
 
03:44:28.670 --> 03:44:28.680 align:start position:0%
so real quick I was on a radio show
 
03:44:30.290 --> 03:44:30.300 align:start position:0%
Monday talking about this and the radio
 
03:44:32.150 --> 03:44:32.160 align:start position:0%
host was very excited the more he
 
03:44:33.650 --> 03:44:33.660 align:start position:0%
learned about it he said this is a great
 
03:44:35.750 --> 03:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
idea when we've done this before and I
 
03:44:38.389 --> 03:44:38.399 align:start position:0%
said well we're trying again Calvin
 
03:44:41.929 --> 03:44:41.939 align:start position:0%
Coolidge persistence is omnipotent
 
03:44:44.450 --> 03:44:44.460 align:start position:0%
so anyway I explained him the process if
 
03:44:45.889 --> 03:44:45.899 align:start position:0%
this gets through this committee which
 
03:44:47.809 --> 03:44:47.819 align:start position:0%
hopefully it will into the Senate and
 
03:44:49.070 --> 03:44:49.080 align:start position:0%
then to the people
 
03:44:51.710 --> 03:44:51.720 align:start position:0%
the people will eventually vote on this
 
03:44:54.769 --> 03:44:54.779 align:start position:0%
it's a constitutional amendment
 
03:44:58.250 --> 03:44:58.260 align:start position:0%
and uh if if we don't like our flawed
 
03:44:59.990 --> 03:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
succession plan I'm afraid that someday
 
03:45:01.990 --> 03:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
they'll there will be a midterm
 
03:45:04.790 --> 03:45:04.800 align:start position:0%
gubernatorial vacancy in subsequent
 
03:45:04.800 --> 03:45:06.229 align:start position:0%
gubernatorial vacancy in subsequent
chaos

03:45:06.229 --> 03:45:06.239 align:start position:0%
chaos
 
03:45:09.610 --> 03:45:09.620 align:start position:0%
in some future Edna committee will then
 
03:45:13.370 --> 03:45:13.380 align:start position:0%
likely recommend well we've got to fix
 
03:45:14.570 --> 03:45:14.580 align:start position:0%
this we need a lieutenant governor
 
03:45:17.690 --> 03:45:17.700 align:start position:0%
position but if if that's what happens
 
03:45:19.550 --> 03:45:19.560 align:start position:0%
down the road whenever
 
03:45:21.590 --> 03:45:21.600 align:start position:0%
I'm sure that there'll be a it'll be
 
03:45:23.570 --> 03:45:23.580 align:start position:0%
structured differently they'll say well
 
03:45:24.830 --> 03:45:24.840 align:start position:0%
we need to pay the lieutenant governor
 
03:45:27.469 --> 03:45:27.479 align:start position:0%
125 000 dollars
 
03:45:29.690 --> 03:45:29.700 align:start position:0%
as opposed to doing it the New Hampshire
 
03:45:31.729 --> 03:45:31.739 align:start position:0%
way with the
 
03:45:34.370 --> 03:45:34.380 align:start position:0%
citizen lieutenant governor all for 125
 
03:45:36.590 --> 03:45:36.600 align:start position:0%
a year so I think we can do this and we
 
03:45:39.349 --> 03:45:39.359 align:start position:0%
should do this and finally if it will
 
03:45:41.349 --> 03:45:41.359 align:start position:0%
help move this measure forward
 
03:45:44.450 --> 03:45:44.460 align:start position:0%
I pledge at this time I will personally
 
03:45:46.550 --> 03:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
pay the lieutenant Governor's salary the
 
03:45:49.670 --> 03:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
first year thank you madam chair and I'd
 
03:45:51.469 --> 03:45:51.479 align:start position:0%
be happy to take any questions if there
 
03:45:52.670 --> 03:45:52.680 align:start position:0%
are any
 
03:45:54.889 --> 03:45:54.899 align:start position:0%
throw an offer like that how can we
 
03:45:57.429 --> 03:45:57.439 align:start position:0%
refuse does anyone have any questions
 
03:45:59.750 --> 03:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
representative Simon
 
03:46:01.849 --> 03:46:01.859 align:start position:0%
thank you representative muffin
 
03:46:05.090 --> 03:46:05.100 align:start position:0%
um my my question is when I'm looking at
 
03:46:07.070 --> 03:46:07.080 align:start position:0%
the bill I don't see that the governor
 
03:46:08.389 --> 03:46:08.399 align:start position:0%
and the lieutenant governor would be
 
03:46:09.769 --> 03:46:09.779 align:start position:0%
running on the same ticket is that
 
03:46:11.750 --> 03:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
correct now yes they would if you read
 
03:46:13.190 --> 03:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
through that
 
03:46:16.010 --> 03:46:16.020 align:start position:0%
um I don't make glasses on no when we
 
03:46:18.349 --> 03:46:18.359 align:start position:0%
set this up with OLS we made it clear
 
03:46:20.510 --> 03:46:20.520 align:start position:0%
that they would run as a ticket and if
 
03:46:22.910 --> 03:46:22.920 align:start position:0%
if you read down the measure it it
 
03:46:25.510 --> 03:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
should make that clear
 
03:46:28.670 --> 03:46:28.680 align:start position:0%
15. okay yeah I see it yeah it's a great
 
03:46:30.530 --> 03:46:30.540 align:start position:0%
question and I think we addressed it and
 
03:46:33.290 --> 03:46:33.300 align:start position:0%
of course uh the committee now owns this
 
03:46:36.110 --> 03:46:36.120 align:start position:0%
measure and and uh obviously can tweak
 
03:46:38.330 --> 03:46:38.340 align:start position:0%
it or do whatever you you want to do
 
03:46:42.650 --> 03:46:42.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:44.330 --> 03:46:44.340 align:start position:0%
thank you that's
 
03:46:46.790 --> 03:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
that's clear anyone else versus Gerhart
 
03:46:48.530 --> 03:46:48.540 align:start position:0%
do you have a question
 
03:46:51.349 --> 03:46:51.359 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair do you miss uh
 
03:46:53.210 --> 03:46:53.220 align:start position:0%
representative Moffett do you personally
 
03:46:55.729 --> 03:46:55.739 align:start position:0%
see somebody coming in to greet students
 
03:46:57.650 --> 03:46:57.660 align:start position:0%
every day and do all these ribbon
 
03:46:59.929 --> 03:46:59.939 align:start position:0%
cuttings for 125 a year just for The
 
03:47:02.090 --> 03:47:02.100 align:start position:0%
Prestige of being lieutenant governor
 
03:47:03.650 --> 03:47:03.660 align:start position:0%
good question thank you for the question
 
03:47:06.349 --> 03:47:06.359 align:start position:0%
representative the answer yes absolutely
 
03:47:08.330 --> 03:47:08.340 align:start position:0%
look at all of us you know we're all
 
03:47:12.469 --> 03:47:12.479 align:start position:0%
here for for less than 125 a year and uh
 
03:47:15.349 --> 03:47:15.359 align:start position:0%
I think that uh it to me it's very
 
03:47:17.090 --> 03:47:17.100 align:start position:0%
exciting you know how would this be
 
03:47:19.790 --> 03:47:19.800 align:start position:0%
filled in the ticket with with the
 
03:47:21.410 --> 03:47:21.420 align:start position:0%
future Governor Pickett an elder
 
03:47:23.870 --> 03:47:23.880 align:start position:0%
Statesman like I won't name any names uh
 
03:47:25.550 --> 03:47:25.560 align:start position:0%
somebody who's been around for a long
 
03:47:29.570 --> 03:47:29.580 align:start position:0%
time and has gravitas and wisdom uh or
 
03:47:31.849 --> 03:47:31.859 align:start position:0%
would they pick a young up-and-comer and
 
03:47:34.490 --> 03:47:34.500 align:start position:0%
again I won't point to anybody uh who
 
03:47:36.290 --> 03:47:36.300 align:start position:0%
was a young up-and-comer to groom them
 
03:47:38.690 --> 03:47:38.700 align:start position:0%
perhaps for future opportunities so
 
03:47:41.290 --> 03:47:41.300 align:start position:0%
absolutely I think people would would
 
03:47:44.269 --> 03:47:44.279 align:start position:0%
love to have this and they see it more
 
03:47:45.889 --> 03:47:45.899 align:start position:0%
ceremonial yes it would be ceremonial
 
03:47:49.969 --> 03:47:49.979 align:start position:0%
but it would also be uh substantive does
 
03:47:52.370 --> 03:47:52.380 align:start position:0%
that kind of answer your question
 
03:47:54.710 --> 03:47:54.720 align:start position:0%
sorta thank you
 
03:47:57.110 --> 03:47:57.120 align:start position:0%
okay representative a bear
 
03:47:59.210 --> 03:47:59.220 align:start position:0%
and then representative true thank you
 
03:48:00.590 --> 03:48:00.600 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
03:48:02.630 --> 03:48:02.640 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Moffett for
 
03:48:04.190 --> 03:48:04.200 align:start position:0%
being here
 
03:48:07.790 --> 03:48:07.800 align:start position:0%
my question to you is why would we have
 
03:48:10.429 --> 03:48:10.439 align:start position:0%
the lieutenant governor run on the same
 
03:48:15.110 --> 03:48:15.120 align:start position:0%
ticket if as as written
 
03:48:16.729 --> 03:48:16.739 align:start position:0%
thing representative another great
 
03:48:19.309 --> 03:48:19.319 align:start position:0%
question because my answer would be that
 
03:48:23.030 --> 03:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
we would want the uh the ticket to be in
 
03:48:25.670 --> 03:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
sync uh there are a couple states where
 
03:48:28.550 --> 03:48:28.560 align:start position:0%
they're elected separately and I don't
 
03:48:29.929 --> 03:48:29.939 align:start position:0%
personally I don't think that's a great
 
03:48:33.710 --> 03:48:33.720 align:start position:0%
model I think that you could elect a
 
03:48:36.710 --> 03:48:36.720 align:start position:0%
a lieutenant governor who is maybe of a
 
03:48:38.090 --> 03:48:38.100 align:start position:0%
different party or different philosophy
 
03:48:40.370 --> 03:48:40.380 align:start position:0%
than the governor again some of you I
 
03:48:42.650 --> 03:48:42.660 align:start position:0%
know some of you know some history uh
 
03:48:45.710 --> 03:48:45.720 align:start position:0%
when our country started the president
 
03:48:47.570 --> 03:48:47.580 align:start position:0%
was elected by the electors and the
 
03:48:49.490 --> 03:48:49.500 align:start position:0%
voters and the vice president was
 
03:48:51.349 --> 03:48:51.359 align:start position:0%
elected separately
 
03:48:53.450 --> 03:48:53.460 align:start position:0%
and we quickly found out that didn't
 
03:48:57.229 --> 03:48:57.239 align:start position:0%
work so well uh especially when one of
 
03:48:58.790 --> 03:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
the Vice Presidents shot and killed
 
03:49:02.030 --> 03:49:02.040 align:start position:0%
Alexander Hamilton and we eventually
 
03:49:04.490 --> 03:49:04.500 align:start position:0%
made that a ticket so this is similar to
 
03:49:07.670 --> 03:49:07.680 align:start position:0%
your great question that's why and also
 
03:49:10.729 --> 03:49:10.739 align:start position:0%
the representative Simon's question it I
 
03:49:12.410 --> 03:49:12.420 align:start position:0%
think it should be a ticket so they're
 
03:49:15.290 --> 03:49:15.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:17.269 --> 03:49:17.279 align:start position:0%
percent of true
 
03:49:18.830 --> 03:49:18.840 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
03:49:20.870 --> 03:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
03:49:20.880 --> 03:49:21.530 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

03:49:21.530 --> 03:49:21.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:49:24.170 --> 03:49:24.180 align:start position:0%
I don't see where uh
 
03:49:26.410 --> 03:49:26.420 align:start position:0%
it is addressed in your in the
 
03:49:29.150 --> 03:49:29.160 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Amendment
 
03:49:32.690 --> 03:49:32.700 align:start position:0%
how the lieutenant governor has chosen
 
03:49:34.070 --> 03:49:34.080 align:start position:0%
um the
 
03:49:36.830 --> 03:49:36.840 align:start position:0%
as you go through a primary and the
 
03:49:39.950 --> 03:49:39.960 align:start position:0%
winner of the primary on the Democrat
 
03:49:42.469 --> 03:49:42.479 align:start position:0%
side if it's a Democrat Governor would
 
03:49:44.210 --> 03:49:44.220 align:start position:0%
be matched up at that time it only
 
03:49:46.130 --> 03:49:46.140 align:start position:0%
mentions November
 
03:49:48.349 --> 03:49:48.359 align:start position:0%
sure thank you representative another
 
03:49:50.030 --> 03:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
great question that's even a better
 
03:49:52.190 --> 03:49:52.200 align:start position:0%
question than the one about uh do they
 
03:49:55.550 --> 03:49:55.560 align:start position:0%
get a desk so my answer to that would be
 
03:49:58.790 --> 03:49:58.800 align:start position:0%
like in most case Most states uh and
 
03:50:00.110 --> 03:50:00.120 align:start position:0%
again you have the opportunity to tweak
 
03:50:02.389 --> 03:50:02.399 align:start position:0%
the language if this moves forward uh to
 
03:50:03.950 --> 03:50:03.960 align:start position:0%
make clear that they would run as a
 
03:50:05.210 --> 03:50:05.220 align:start position:0%
ticket and that's the way it happens in
 
03:50:09.170 --> 03:50:09.180 align:start position:0%
Most states uh the governor is uh
 
03:50:12.650 --> 03:50:12.660 align:start position:0%
in the in his or her running mate run as
 
03:50:15.349 --> 03:50:15.359 align:start position:0%
a ticket so in the primary and this is
 
03:50:17.750 --> 03:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
kind of interesting it is a service I
 
03:50:21.110 --> 03:50:21.120 align:start position:0%
think it's fun and exciting uh to have
 
03:50:23.990 --> 03:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
tickets now so that uh
 
03:50:27.469 --> 03:50:27.479 align:start position:0%
you have you get to vote for two instead
 
03:50:29.510 --> 03:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
of one so that's how I see this
 
03:50:33.110 --> 03:50:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:37.550 --> 03:50:37.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:39.590 --> 03:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:50:42.229 --> 03:50:42.239 align:start position:0%
so representative uh
 
03:50:45.889 --> 03:50:45.899 align:start position:0%
uh in all seriousness if the lieutenant
 
03:50:47.570 --> 03:50:47.580 align:start position:0%
governor is going to be taking over the
 
03:50:50.690 --> 03:50:50.700 align:start position:0%
ribbon cutting and such ceremonial
 
03:50:53.630 --> 03:50:53.640 align:start position:0%
activities then he or she is going to
 
03:50:57.650 --> 03:50:57.660 align:start position:0%
have uh to have a separate vehicle a
 
03:50:59.870 --> 03:50:59.880 align:start position:0%
separate driver because the governor
 
03:51:02.210 --> 03:51:02.220 align:start position:0%
doesn't drive himself around he he's
 
03:51:05.630 --> 03:51:05.640 align:start position:0%
driven by a State Trooper who is also
 
03:51:08.170 --> 03:51:08.180 align:start position:0%
his in this case bodyguard
 
03:51:10.610 --> 03:51:10.620 align:start position:0%
but also his driver because we don't
 
03:51:12.110 --> 03:51:12.120 align:start position:0%
want the governor having a traffic
 
03:51:12.120 --> 03:51:13.910 align:start position:0%
want the governor having a traffic
accident

03:51:13.910 --> 03:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
accident
 
03:51:16.429 --> 03:51:16.439 align:start position:0%
and possibly being killed as a result of
 
03:51:18.830 --> 03:51:18.840 align:start position:0%
being maybe not the best driver in the
 
03:51:21.170 --> 03:51:21.180 align:start position:0%
world but the point is that uh that
 
03:51:23.809 --> 03:51:23.819 align:start position:0%
there's going to be aside from the 125
 
03:51:26.210 --> 03:51:26.220 align:start position:0%
dollars which I'm glad to hear you would
 
03:51:30.590 --> 03:51:30.600 align:start position:0%
pick up uh the the cost of the staff for
 
03:51:33.889 --> 03:51:33.899 align:start position:0%
this lieutenant governor is is a
 
03:51:37.010 --> 03:51:37.020 align:start position:0%
definite expansion of government so uh
 
03:51:38.870 --> 03:51:38.880 align:start position:0%
the lieutenant governor is not going to
 
03:51:40.969 --> 03:51:40.979 align:start position:0%
be answering his or her own phone I
 
03:51:44.510 --> 03:51:44.520 align:start position:0%
believe uh or you know welcoming people
 
03:51:48.050 --> 03:51:48.060 align:start position:0%
to his or her office which would have to
 
03:51:49.790 --> 03:51:49.800 align:start position:0%
be provided and so forth so they're
 
03:51:52.010 --> 03:51:52.020 align:start position:0%
they're going to be Staffing costs and
 
03:51:53.870 --> 03:51:53.880 align:start position:0%
have you given any thought to what kind
 
03:51:57.530 --> 03:51:57.540 align:start position:0%
of cost would be involved to handle all
 
03:52:00.170 --> 03:52:00.180 align:start position:0%
the security and and other
 
03:52:02.030 --> 03:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
administrative functions that this
 
03:52:04.550 --> 03:52:04.560 align:start position:0%
lieutenant governor would be doing so
 
03:52:06.889 --> 03:52:06.899 align:start position:0%
that's question number one thank you
 
03:52:08.750 --> 03:52:08.760 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt and that that
 
03:52:10.849 --> 03:52:10.859 align:start position:0%
really is is a great question and it's
 
03:52:13.190 --> 03:52:13.200 align:start position:0%
one you know we're sailing into some
 
03:52:15.110 --> 03:52:15.120 align:start position:0%
uncharted waters so to speak and
 
03:52:17.990 --> 03:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
questions like that uh yes
 
03:52:21.110 --> 03:52:21.120 align:start position:0%
um the governor would have especially if
 
03:52:23.690 --> 03:52:23.700 align:start position:0%
this ever moves forward then the first
 
03:52:25.910 --> 03:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
lieutenant governor governor situation
 
03:52:28.550 --> 03:52:28.560 align:start position:0%
would be setting a lot of Precedence uh
 
03:52:31.070 --> 03:52:31.080 align:start position:0%
and of course every president every
 
03:52:33.170 --> 03:52:33.180 align:start position:0%
Governor handles their staff differently
 
03:52:35.330 --> 03:52:35.340 align:start position:0%
uh you're right that's an excellent
 
03:52:37.370 --> 03:52:37.380 align:start position:0%
point there are some other expenses now
 
03:52:39.889 --> 03:52:39.899 align:start position:0%
would would the governor would the
 
03:52:41.690 --> 03:52:41.700 align:start position:0%
lieutenant governor if he or she had to
 
03:52:43.309 --> 03:52:43.319 align:start position:0%
go to represent the governor in
 
03:52:45.530 --> 03:52:45.540 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth for whatever would they have
 
03:52:49.550 --> 03:52:49.560 align:start position:0%
a state car uh I would say probably I
 
03:52:50.870 --> 03:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
mean if I was lieutenant governor I
 
03:52:52.550 --> 03:52:52.560 align:start position:0%
would I would offer to drive myself but
 
03:52:54.070 --> 03:52:54.080 align:start position:0%
you make a good point
 
03:52:56.330 --> 03:52:56.340 align:start position:0%
you can't have the person in line to
 
03:52:59.030 --> 03:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
receive the governor not being you know
 
03:53:00.950 --> 03:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
having security so there would be some
 
03:53:02.870 --> 03:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
class and expenses there would they be
 
03:53:02.880 --> 03:53:04.429 align:start position:0%
class and expenses there would they be
daunting

03:53:04.429 --> 03:53:04.439 align:start position:0%
daunting
 
03:53:08.330 --> 03:53:08.340 align:start position:0%
um I I don't know exactly uh what those
 
03:53:10.849 --> 03:53:10.859 align:start position:0%
costs might entail I think they could be
 
03:53:14.330 --> 03:53:14.340 align:start position:0%
fairly minimal if it depends how active
 
03:53:15.290 --> 03:53:15.300 align:start position:0%
the lieutenant governor is going to be
 
03:53:17.809 --> 03:53:17.819 align:start position:0%
how much they're going to travel uh good
 
03:53:19.670 --> 03:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
question but I think those are
 
03:53:20.809 --> 03:53:20.819 align:start position:0%
manageable and it would be up to the
 
03:53:24.349 --> 03:53:24.359 align:start position:0%
governor to decide how broadly how much
 
03:53:27.349 --> 03:53:27.359 align:start position:0%
they want to use their lieutenant
 
03:53:30.290 --> 03:53:30.300 align:start position:0%
governor and as you said I I've offered
 
03:53:32.269 --> 03:53:32.279 align:start position:0%
to pay the first salary but not the
 
03:53:37.130 --> 03:53:37.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:38.990 --> 03:53:39.000 align:start position:0%
I think we had to have something in
 
03:53:41.389 --> 03:53:41.399 align:start position:0%
writing from you with regard to how much
 
03:53:45.170 --> 03:53:45.180 align:start position:0%
of the additional costs which it you're
 
03:53:47.389 --> 03:53:47.399 align:start position:0%
you're saying that the governor is going
 
03:53:50.510 --> 03:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
to do is going to declare and determine
 
03:53:53.630 --> 03:53:53.640 align:start position:0%
what the functions of the lieutenant
 
03:53:55.570 --> 03:53:55.580 align:start position:0%
governor are going to be in
 
03:53:58.969 --> 03:53:58.979 align:start position:0%
the president does have a lot of say
 
03:54:01.670 --> 03:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
with regard to how much the vice
 
03:54:05.389 --> 03:54:05.399 align:start position:0%
president is taking care of and the Czar
 
03:54:09.469 --> 03:54:09.479 align:start position:0%
you mentioned of this or that current
 
03:54:13.309 --> 03:54:13.319 align:start position:0%
crisis or critical situation but but uh
 
03:54:17.030 --> 03:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
I don't think uh that that a
 
03:54:21.410 --> 03:54:21.420 align:start position:0%
a governor is going to be able to have
 
03:54:24.650 --> 03:54:24.660 align:start position:0%
free will and free Reign Over what the
 
03:54:26.990 --> 03:54:27.000 align:start position:0%
lieutenant governor is going to do
 
03:54:30.889 --> 03:54:30.899 align:start position:0%
um and so that I I'm that I'm asking you
 
03:54:34.309 --> 03:54:34.319 align:start position:0%
the cost involved uh are going to be
 
03:54:36.710 --> 03:54:36.720 align:start position:0%
more considerable and where have you
 
03:54:39.830 --> 03:54:39.840 align:start position:0%
given some thought to the governor has a
 
03:54:42.050 --> 03:54:42.060 align:start position:0%
residence in New Hampshire
 
03:54:44.929 --> 03:54:44.939 align:start position:0%
rarely uses it but uh where would the
 
03:54:46.610 --> 03:54:46.620 align:start position:0%
lieutenant governor live
 
03:54:49.910 --> 03:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
so again uh you make a good point uh
 
03:54:52.670 --> 03:54:52.680 align:start position:0%
there is an Air Force too we don't know
 
03:54:53.990 --> 03:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
about Air Force One there is an Air
 
03:54:56.389 --> 03:54:56.399 align:start position:0%
Force too that the vice president uses
 
03:54:59.030 --> 03:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
so we're some version of that to come
 
03:55:02.510 --> 03:55:02.520 align:start position:0%
here to New Hampshire uh again I can't I
 
03:55:04.250 --> 03:55:04.260 align:start position:0%
don't want to necessarily speak for some
 
03:55:07.070 --> 03:55:07.080 align:start position:0%
future Governor uh depends you know some
 
03:55:09.710 --> 03:55:09.720 align:start position:0%
governments may want to minimize what
 
03:55:11.570 --> 03:55:11.580 align:start position:0%
they invest in this new position in
 
03:55:15.469 --> 03:55:15.479 align:start position:0%
terms of uh support uh so I don't want
 
03:55:17.570 --> 03:55:17.580 align:start position:0%
to speak for a future Governor if if I
 
03:55:19.790 --> 03:55:19.800 align:start position:0%
was a governor which I never will be I
 
03:55:23.929 --> 03:55:23.939 align:start position:0%
would probably try to uh you know be as
 
03:55:26.330 --> 03:55:26.340 align:start position:0%
efficient as I could uh coordinate
 
03:55:28.729 --> 03:55:28.739 align:start position:0%
schedules have the lieutenant governor
 
03:55:32.269 --> 03:55:32.279 align:start position:0%
use my vehicle when I'm not using it to
 
03:55:35.570 --> 03:55:35.580 align:start position:0%
be efficient and Frugal but those are
 
03:55:38.330 --> 03:55:38.340 align:start position:0%
things that issues that don't need to be
 
03:55:41.349 --> 03:55:41.359 align:start position:0%
part of the Constitution those are
 
03:55:45.050 --> 03:55:45.060 align:start position:0%
administrative type questions that the
 
03:55:47.870 --> 03:55:47.880 align:start position:0%
governor's office and the governor has a
 
03:55:47.880 --> 03:55:49.070 align:start position:0%
governor's office and the governor has a
budget

03:55:49.070 --> 03:55:49.080 align:start position:0%
budget
 
03:55:52.490 --> 03:55:52.500 align:start position:0%
I think yes if this move forward I think
 
03:55:54.229 --> 03:55:54.239 align:start position:0%
the government's budget might have to go
 
03:55:57.769 --> 03:55:57.779 align:start position:0%
up uh a minimal amount
 
03:55:57.779 --> 03:55:58.450 align:start position:0%
up uh a minimal amount
um

03:55:58.450 --> 03:55:58.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:56:00.830 --> 03:56:00.840 align:start position:0%
TBD to be determined we depend on the
 
03:56:00.840 --> 03:56:02.830 align:start position:0%
TBD to be determined we depend on the
governor

03:56:02.830 --> 03:56:02.840 align:start position:0%
governor
 
03:56:08.689 --> 03:56:08.699 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:11.090 --> 03:56:11.100 align:start position:0%
um you had said and I think perhaps
 
03:56:13.849 --> 03:56:13.859 align:start position:0%
somewhat optimistically that that the
 
03:56:15.590 --> 03:56:15.600 align:start position:0%
candidate lieutenant governor candidate
 
03:56:17.750 --> 03:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
would be chosen for their gravitas and
 
03:56:19.969 --> 03:56:19.979 align:start position:0%
their wisdom
 
03:56:22.370 --> 03:56:22.380 align:start position:0%
um what I hear more frequently perhaps
 
03:56:22.380 --> 03:56:23.570 align:start position:0%
um what I hear more frequently perhaps
unfairly

03:56:23.570 --> 03:56:23.580 align:start position:0%
unfairly
 
03:56:25.429 --> 03:56:25.439 align:start position:0%
with the president of the vice president
 
03:56:27.650 --> 03:56:27.660 align:start position:0%
as they're choosing some someone that
 
03:56:31.010 --> 03:56:31.020 align:start position:0%
won't outshine them I'm sorry I didn't
 
03:56:33.110 --> 03:56:33.120 align:start position:0%
catch your lip more often I hear in the
 
03:56:35.090 --> 03:56:35.100 align:start position:0%
news that the vice president has chosen
 
03:56:36.950 --> 03:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
either for their location that they're
 
03:56:39.830 --> 03:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
providing another location but also
 
03:56:41.870 --> 03:56:41.880 align:start position:0%
someone that won't outshine the
 
03:56:45.650 --> 03:56:45.660 align:start position:0%
president a lesser entity right rather
 
03:56:48.469 --> 03:56:48.479 align:start position:0%
than gravitas and wisdom
 
03:56:48.479 --> 03:56:49.790 align:start position:0%
than gravitas and wisdom
yes

03:56:49.790 --> 03:56:49.800 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:56:49.800 --> 03:56:50.510 align:start position:0%
yes
um

03:56:50.510 --> 03:56:50.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:56:52.490 --> 03:56:52.500 align:start position:0%
Senator Dan Quayle comes to mind when
 
03:56:54.650 --> 03:56:54.660 align:start position:0%
you when you say that um
 
03:56:57.889 --> 03:56:57.899 align:start position:0%
uh vice president Quail so again this to
 
03:57:00.110 --> 03:57:00.120 align:start position:0%
me this gets to the exciting part of
 
03:57:01.969 --> 03:57:01.979 align:start position:0%
this would there be a political
 
03:57:04.510 --> 03:57:04.520 align:start position:0%
component to having a ticket of course
 
03:57:07.309 --> 03:57:07.319 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure the wheels are turning in
 
03:57:09.229 --> 03:57:09.239 align:start position:0%
some heads thinking okay if this moves
 
03:57:11.570 --> 03:57:11.580 align:start position:0%
forward to your point
 
03:57:14.389 --> 03:57:14.399 align:start position:0%
um should we have a male female old
 
03:57:16.790 --> 03:57:16.800 align:start position:0%
young somebody from the North Country a
 
03:57:18.830 --> 03:57:18.840 align:start position:0%
geographical balance I don't know but I
 
03:57:21.110 --> 03:57:21.120 align:start position:0%
think Ali's potential combinations are
 
03:57:23.330 --> 03:57:23.340 align:start position:0%
exciting and the gravitas issue I mean
 
03:57:25.490 --> 03:57:25.500 align:start position:0%
it's up to the if if you have a really
 
03:57:28.130 --> 03:57:28.140 align:start position:0%
young person running for for governor
 
03:57:31.130 --> 03:57:31.140 align:start position:0%
they may go for the gravitas or older uh
 
03:57:33.170 --> 03:57:33.180 align:start position:0%
running mate if you ever really
 
03:57:36.229 --> 03:57:36.239 align:start position:0%
older the the other way around you might
 
03:57:40.130 --> 03:57:40.140 align:start position:0%
if there's a really old old I'd say old
 
03:57:44.150 --> 03:57:44.160 align:start position:0%
uh more seasoned candidate running for
 
03:57:45.889 --> 03:57:45.899 align:start position:0%
governor I would see them potentially
 
03:57:48.950 --> 03:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
picking somebody younger younger to as I
 
03:57:50.450 --> 03:57:50.460 align:start position:0%
said earlier to potentially groom them
 
03:57:52.849 --> 03:57:52.859 align:start position:0%
for future service I I think it's really
 
03:57:54.830 --> 03:57:54.840 align:start position:0%
exciting this might evolve in the future
 
03:57:57.769 --> 03:57:57.779 align:start position:0%
but I think it's exciting to think about
 
03:57:59.269 --> 03:57:59.279 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:57:59.279 --> 03:58:00.530 align:start position:0%
thank you
okay

03:58:00.530 --> 03:58:00.540 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:58:03.830 --> 03:58:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:05.750 --> 03:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh thank you yeah I had a question on
 
03:58:07.429 --> 03:58:07.439 align:start position:0%
the idea of doing it the New Hampshire
 
03:58:07.439 --> 03:58:08.570 align:start position:0%
the idea of doing it the New Hampshire
way

03:58:08.570 --> 03:58:08.580 align:start position:0%
way
 
03:58:09.889 --> 03:58:09.899 align:start position:0%
um so we would have a governor that
 
03:58:11.510 --> 03:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
makes a fairly substantial salary and
 
03:58:12.889 --> 03:58:12.899 align:start position:0%
then a lieutenant governor that would
 
03:58:14.889 --> 03:58:14.899 align:start position:0%
make 125
 
03:58:17.389 --> 03:58:17.399 align:start position:0%
within that Paradigm and with the amount
 
03:58:19.070 --> 03:58:19.080 align:start position:0%
of control that the governor would have
 
03:58:21.530 --> 03:58:21.540 align:start position:0%
in delineating the responsibilities of
 
03:58:23.990 --> 03:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
the lieutenant governor how can we be
 
03:58:26.269 --> 03:58:26.279 align:start position:0%
assured that the lieutenant governor
 
03:58:28.550 --> 03:58:28.560 align:start position:0%
would be adequately prepared to take on
 
03:58:29.689 --> 03:58:29.699 align:start position:0%
the role of the governor should
 
03:58:31.130 --> 03:58:31.140 align:start position:0%
something happen to the governor because
 
03:58:33.229 --> 03:58:33.239 align:start position:0%
if the governor's just say they do just
 
03:58:34.550 --> 03:58:34.560 align:start position:0%
want to use them for ribbon cuttings
 
03:58:36.769 --> 03:58:36.779 align:start position:0%
ceremonies things of that nature they're
 
03:58:38.450 --> 03:58:38.460 align:start position:0%
not super involved in the political
 
03:58:39.950 --> 03:58:39.960 align:start position:0%
process whereas at least the Senate
 
03:58:41.689 --> 03:58:41.699 align:start position:0%
President is familiar with everything
 
03:58:43.670 --> 03:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
that's going on at that particular point
 
03:58:44.929 --> 03:58:44.939 align:start position:0%
in time how can we ensure that that
 
03:58:46.670 --> 03:58:46.680 align:start position:0%
person would be better prepared than the
 
03:58:48.710 --> 03:58:48.720 align:start position:0%
Senate President uh to fill that role
 
03:58:51.530 --> 03:58:51.540 align:start position:0%
sure thank you for the question I am
 
03:58:53.570 --> 03:58:53.580 align:start position:0%
sure that if this moved forward whoever
 
03:58:56.809 --> 03:58:56.819 align:start position:0%
was running for governor and was going
 
03:58:58.670 --> 03:58:58.680 align:start position:0%
to have a ticket they would vet their
 
03:59:01.610 --> 03:59:01.620 align:start position:0%
running mate uh extremely closely for
 
03:59:03.769 --> 03:59:03.779 align:start position:0%
all kinds of things you know what's your
 
03:59:05.809 --> 03:59:05.819 align:start position:0%
variants do they have any skeletons in
 
03:59:08.210 --> 03:59:08.220 align:start position:0%
their closet what are their skills do
 
03:59:09.969 --> 03:59:09.979 align:start position:0%
they get along with each other
 
03:59:14.689 --> 03:59:14.699 align:start position:0%
I I have no doubt that anyone if this
 
03:59:16.550 --> 03:59:16.560 align:start position:0%
moves forward who picks a running mate
 
03:59:19.550 --> 03:59:19.560 align:start position:0%
would pick someone that would be ready
 
03:59:21.710 --> 03:59:21.720 align:start position:0%
right away to uh
 
03:59:25.130 --> 03:59:25.140 align:start position:0%
to assume the the governorship and yes
 
03:59:27.469 --> 03:59:27.479 align:start position:0%
if the lieutenant government for
 
03:59:28.910 --> 03:59:28.920 align:start position:0%
whatever reason the governor is out of
 
03:59:31.189 --> 03:59:31.199 align:start position:0%
state if when the governor's out of
 
03:59:33.769 --> 03:59:33.779 align:start position:0%
state the Senate President and sometimes
 
03:59:37.010 --> 03:59:37.020 align:start position:0%
goes down to the treasurer becomes the
 
03:59:38.330 --> 03:59:38.340 align:start position:0%
acting governor
 
03:59:40.370 --> 03:59:40.380 align:start position:0%
so the
 
03:59:43.189 --> 03:59:43.199 align:start position:0%
Governor if the governor needed to be
 
03:59:45.410 --> 03:59:45.420 align:start position:0%
replaced FYI
 
03:59:48.469 --> 03:59:48.479 align:start position:0%
um the the salary of the governor you
 
03:59:49.729 --> 03:59:49.739 align:start position:0%
know the person
 
03:59:51.469 --> 03:59:51.479 align:start position:0%
succeeding the government would accept
 
03:59:54.290 --> 03:59:54.300 align:start position:0%
this Governor's full salary when Senator
 
03:59:56.630 --> 03:59:56.640 align:start position:0%
Morse became acting governor for a few
 
04:00:01.250 --> 04:00:01.260 align:start position:0%
days in 2016. he made a lot of money he
 
04:00:04.429 --> 04:00:04.439 align:start position:0%
made thousands of dollars uh in those
 
04:00:06.830 --> 04:00:06.840 align:start position:0%
few days when he was acting Governor so
 
04:00:08.450 --> 04:00:08.460 align:start position:0%
does that kind of address your question
 
04:00:10.849 --> 04:00:10.859 align:start position:0%
hopefully somewhat IT addresses the
 
04:00:12.590 --> 04:00:12.600 align:start position:0%
question maybe not totally my concern
 
04:00:15.290 --> 04:00:15.300 align:start position:0%
but yeah the question so thanks thank
 
04:00:15.300 --> 04:00:18.229 align:start position:0%
but yeah the question so thanks thank
you

04:00:18.229 --> 04:00:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:20.090 --> 04:00:20.100 align:start position:0%
thank you I mean I understand the
 
04:00:21.710 --> 04:00:21.720 align:start position:0%
concerns that cause you to bring this
 
04:00:23.030 --> 04:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
forward I
 
04:00:24.650 --> 04:00:24.660 align:start position:0%
I have some
 
04:00:27.290 --> 04:00:27.300 align:start position:0%
foreboding or discomfort I I can't I
 
04:00:29.269 --> 04:00:29.279 align:start position:0%
find it hard to imagine and you can tell
 
04:00:32.330 --> 04:00:32.340 align:start position:0%
me you know if I'm wrong that
 
04:00:33.469 --> 04:00:33.479 align:start position:0%
um somebody's going to enter this
 
04:00:34.550 --> 04:00:34.560 align:start position:0%
position and there's not going to be
 
04:00:36.110 --> 04:00:36.120 align:start position:0%
pressure over time
 
04:00:39.769 --> 04:00:39.779 align:start position:0%
to expand the job not just how the
 
04:00:41.870 --> 04:00:41.880 align:start position:0%
governor uses them but eventually
 
04:00:44.410 --> 04:00:44.420 align:start position:0%
officially and ends up becoming a whole
 
04:00:47.870 --> 04:00:47.880 align:start position:0%
segment of government on its own so I
 
04:00:49.010 --> 04:00:49.020 align:start position:0%
don't know why you would believe that
 
04:00:50.689 --> 04:00:50.699 align:start position:0%
wouldn't happen and then thus it would
 
04:00:53.510 --> 04:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
become more expensive and and one point
 
04:00:55.490 --> 04:00:55.500 align:start position:0%
I would make and that is uh at least for
 
04:00:58.189 --> 04:00:58.199 align:start position:0%
me I I you can tell me you know why I'd
 
04:01:00.349 --> 04:01:00.359 align:start position:0%
be wrong but uh I don't think adding
 
04:01:01.370 --> 04:01:01.380 align:start position:0%
more excitement to New Hampshire
 
04:01:04.370 --> 04:01:04.380 align:start position:0%
politics is a positive
 
04:01:06.110 --> 04:01:06.120 align:start position:0%
thank you representative I mean
 
04:01:08.269 --> 04:01:08.279 align:start position:0%
excitement in a good way
 
04:01:12.410 --> 04:01:12.420 align:start position:0%
um so yes yes to your point about uh
 
04:01:16.189 --> 04:01:16.199 align:start position:0%
Mission creep or or growing or uh I
 
04:01:18.170 --> 04:01:18.180 align:start position:0%
think there's a lot of folks here that
 
04:01:20.689 --> 04:01:20.699 align:start position:0%
watch watch the governor's office and
 
04:01:21.830 --> 04:01:21.840 align:start position:0%
what they're up to what they do what
 
04:01:24.349 --> 04:01:24.359 align:start position:0%
they spend and everything that's what we
 
04:01:24.359 --> 04:01:25.429 align:start position:0%
they spend and everything that's what we
do

04:01:25.429 --> 04:01:25.439 align:start position:0%
do
 
04:01:32.269 --> 04:01:32.279 align:start position:0%
um and with this 424 or 423 of us who uh
 
04:01:35.570 --> 04:01:35.580 align:start position:0%
keep an eye on the executive branch and
 
04:01:38.210 --> 04:01:38.220 align:start position:0%
if if there was and it ended up being
 
04:01:41.510 --> 04:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
some uh excessive uh spending or
 
04:01:41.520 --> 04:01:42.729 align:start position:0%
some uh excessive uh spending or
activity

04:01:42.729 --> 04:01:42.739 align:start position:0%
activity
 
04:01:47.330 --> 04:01:47.340 align:start position:0%
then you know transparency I mean people
 
04:01:50.090 --> 04:01:50.100 align:start position:0%
are watching and can have some impact on
 
04:01:51.530 --> 04:01:51.540 align:start position:0%
how the governor does whatever the
 
04:01:57.290 --> 04:01:57.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:00.349 --> 04:02:00.359 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
04:02:01.910 --> 04:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much
 
04:02:05.389 --> 04:02:05.399 align:start position:0%
representative thank you madam chair
 
04:02:17.510 --> 04:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:19.610 --> 04:02:19.620 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Madam chair members
 
04:02:21.050 --> 04:02:21.060 align:start position:0%
of the committee for the record my name
 
04:02:24.349 --> 04:02:24.359 align:start position:0%
is Dan McGuire I represent Epsom
 
04:02:26.330 --> 04:02:26.340 align:start position:0%
and I didn't see anyone else in the
 
04:02:27.769 --> 04:02:27.779 align:start position:0%
audience who was going to speak against
 
04:02:29.510 --> 04:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
this so I thought I'd at least come up
 
04:02:32.030 --> 04:02:32.040 align:start position:0%
and and present some the other side of
 
04:02:33.650 --> 04:02:33.660 align:start position:0%
the story
 
04:02:36.650 --> 04:02:36.660 align:start position:0%
um first of all
 
04:02:38.389 --> 04:02:38.399 align:start position:0%
maybe we don't have to do anything
 
04:02:40.429 --> 04:02:40.439 align:start position:0%
simply because we're talking about
 
04:02:43.969 --> 04:02:43.979 align:start position:0%
fixing a very rare circumstance right
 
04:02:47.050 --> 04:02:47.060 align:start position:0%
the state's been around 250 years
 
04:02:49.910 --> 04:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
we can't really point to some horrible
 
04:02:52.010 --> 04:02:52.020 align:start position:0%
thing that's happened along these lines
 
04:02:55.189 --> 04:02:55.199 align:start position:0%
so you know maybe it's less than ideal
 
04:02:58.250 --> 04:02:58.260 align:start position:0%
what we have now but it's so rare
 
04:03:00.290 --> 04:03:00.300 align:start position:0%
that's okay to be less than ideal every
 
04:03:02.269 --> 04:03:02.279 align:start position:0%
once in a while you know
 
04:03:04.849 --> 04:03:04.859 align:start position:0%
um but let's say you're convinced you
 
04:03:06.650 --> 04:03:06.660 align:start position:0%
don't like the current situation and you
 
04:03:08.630 --> 04:03:08.640 align:start position:0%
want it to be changed
 
04:03:10.610 --> 04:03:10.620 align:start position:0%
um so let's talk about our governor in
 
04:03:13.729 --> 04:03:13.739 align:start position:0%
particular and what they do and so on so
 
04:03:16.429 --> 04:03:16.439 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has the weakest governor
 
04:03:19.610 --> 04:03:19.620 align:start position:0%
in the country the only real power that
 
04:03:22.309 --> 04:03:22.319 align:start position:0%
the governor has on their own is vetoing
 
04:03:22.319 --> 04:03:24.349 align:start position:0%
the governor has on their own is vetoing
legislation

04:03:24.349 --> 04:03:24.359 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
04:03:27.229 --> 04:03:27.239 align:start position:0%
the governor is only elected for two
 
04:03:31.070 --> 04:03:31.080 align:start position:0%
years many are elected for four
 
04:03:33.590 --> 04:03:33.600 align:start position:0%
um the governor appoints Commissioners
 
04:03:36.050 --> 04:03:36.060 align:start position:0%
and appoints a lot of people
 
04:03:39.290 --> 04:03:39.300 align:start position:0%
but often those Commissioners are given
 
04:03:41.570 --> 04:03:41.580 align:start position:0%
contracts longer than the governor's
 
04:03:41.580 --> 04:03:42.650 align:start position:0%
contracts longer than the governor's
term

04:03:42.650 --> 04:03:42.660 align:start position:0%
term
 
04:03:44.809 --> 04:03:44.819 align:start position:0%
right so the commissioner of I don't
 
04:03:46.670 --> 04:03:46.680 align:start position:0%
know dot or something might have a
 
04:03:50.570 --> 04:03:50.580 align:start position:0%
five-year term and so the person in that
 
04:03:53.090 --> 04:03:53.100 align:start position:0%
role could be somebody left over you
 
04:03:54.469 --> 04:03:54.479 align:start position:0%
know it could be somebody that that's
 
04:03:56.030 --> 04:03:56.040 align:start position:0%
not going to be appointed by this
 
04:03:58.490 --> 04:03:58.500 align:start position:0%
Governor at all and and so they don't
 
04:04:00.710 --> 04:04:00.720 align:start position:0%
necessarily work for the governor in the
 
04:04:02.750 --> 04:04:02.760 align:start position:0%
same way they would in many states you
 
04:04:04.729 --> 04:04:04.739 align:start position:0%
get a new governor you clean a house
 
04:04:06.710 --> 04:04:06.720 align:start position:0%
right you have a whole new new set of
 
04:04:09.290 --> 04:04:09.300 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and so on okay that's not
 
04:04:11.030 --> 04:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
the case here we have a lot of
 
04:04:14.870 --> 04:04:14.880 align:start position:0%
continuity among the Commissioners and
 
04:04:16.370 --> 04:04:16.380 align:start position:0%
the executives this thing
 
04:04:18.769 --> 04:04:18.779 align:start position:0%
and then finally we've been thinking
 
04:04:21.410 --> 04:04:21.420 align:start position:0%
that all we have is a governor but we
 
04:04:25.130 --> 04:04:25.140 align:start position:0%
really have six elected members of the
 
04:04:27.650 --> 04:04:27.660 align:start position:0%
executive branch we have an executive
 
04:04:30.530 --> 04:04:30.540 align:start position:0%
Council right there are five elected
 
04:04:32.510 --> 04:04:32.520 align:start position:0%
members of the executive Council from
 
04:04:34.490 --> 04:04:34.500 align:start position:0%
five different regions
 
04:04:36.290 --> 04:04:36.300 align:start position:0%
and they work closely with the governor
 
04:04:37.849 --> 04:04:37.859 align:start position:0%
anytime the governor wants to appoint
 
04:04:41.330 --> 04:04:41.340 align:start position:0%
someone they have to approve it anytime
 
04:04:43.189 --> 04:04:43.199 align:start position:0%
they want to sign a contract above a
 
04:04:45.590 --> 04:04:45.600 align:start position:0%
certain amount they have to approve it
 
04:04:48.889 --> 04:04:48.899 align:start position:0%
right so already the governor's power is
 
04:04:51.650 --> 04:04:51.660 align:start position:0%
less so certainly the governor doesn't
 
04:04:54.530 --> 04:04:54.540 align:start position:0%
need help right so the the governor
 
04:04:57.469 --> 04:04:57.479 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't have a lot to do I guess
 
04:05:00.469 --> 04:05:00.479 align:start position:0%
is my point and so so the idea that we
 
04:05:02.870 --> 04:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
need an extra person to help them that's
 
04:05:05.750 --> 04:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
not really the case but but beyond that
 
04:05:08.929 --> 04:05:08.939 align:start position:0%
because I'm somewhat sympathetic to the
 
04:05:11.630 --> 04:05:11.640 align:start position:0%
idea that it's awkward to pick the
 
04:05:14.570 --> 04:05:14.580 align:start position:0%
Senate President out of the Senate and
 
04:05:17.030 --> 04:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
have them do something else now that's
 
04:05:19.189 --> 04:05:19.199 align:start position:0%
not that unusual I mean the the US
 
04:05:22.250 --> 04:05:22.260 align:start position:0%
government makes the the U.S vice
 
04:05:23.990 --> 04:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
president the president of the Senate
 
04:05:27.050 --> 04:05:27.060 align:start position:0%
right so it's not you know mixing the
 
04:05:30.170 --> 04:05:30.180 align:start position:0%
two is not just never done or something
 
04:05:33.170 --> 04:05:33.180 align:start position:0%
like that but even so it does seem
 
04:05:35.210 --> 04:05:35.220 align:start position:0%
awkward right having one less Senator
 
04:05:37.309 --> 04:05:37.319 align:start position:0%
what do you do re-elect that that
 
04:05:41.150 --> 04:05:41.160 align:start position:0%
position or who knows but but if you
 
04:05:44.030 --> 04:05:44.040 align:start position:0%
wanted to fix it to me a better way of
 
04:05:46.370 --> 04:05:46.380 align:start position:0%
fixing it would be pick an executive
 
04:05:49.370 --> 04:05:49.380 align:start position:0%
counselor somebody who's already part of
 
04:05:51.650 --> 04:05:51.660 align:start position:0%
the executive branch somebody who's
 
04:05:54.349 --> 04:05:54.359 align:start position:0%
already been elected not quite Statewide
 
04:05:57.830 --> 04:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
but by a very substantial margin and so
 
04:06:00.110 --> 04:06:00.120 align:start position:0%
just ask the five executive counselors
 
04:06:02.929 --> 04:06:02.939 align:start position:0%
to promote somebody into that you know
 
04:06:05.689 --> 04:06:05.699 align:start position:0%
leftover position for a year or or less
 
04:06:07.610 --> 04:06:07.620 align:start position:0%
you know whatever the the amount is
 
04:06:10.429 --> 04:06:10.439 align:start position:0%
right it's it's an unusual situation but
 
04:06:12.410 --> 04:06:12.420 align:start position:0%
but it seems to me that would be an easy
 
04:06:15.290 --> 04:06:15.300 align:start position:0%
an easy fix and then there would be no
 
04:06:17.870 --> 04:06:17.880 align:start position:0%
question about mixing the legislature
 
04:06:20.269 --> 04:06:20.279 align:start position:0%
with the executive branch
 
04:06:23.750 --> 04:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
um and and be somebody familiar with the
 
04:06:24.950 --> 04:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
going things that the government
 
04:06:26.929 --> 04:06:26.939 align:start position:0%
Governor has been working on and so on
 
04:06:28.969 --> 04:06:28.979 align:start position:0%
you'd still have the argument well what
 
04:06:31.010 --> 04:06:31.020 align:start position:0%
if the executive council is one party
 
04:06:33.889 --> 04:06:33.899 align:start position:0%
and the governor is another well
 
04:06:35.150 --> 04:06:35.160 align:start position:0%
obviously you've got a divided
 
04:06:39.110 --> 04:06:39.120 align:start position:0%
government right so just that happens so
 
04:06:40.790 --> 04:06:40.800 align:start position:0%
so overall
 
04:06:42.830 --> 04:06:42.840 align:start position:0%
um I guess I I don't care for this
 
04:06:45.950 --> 04:06:45.960 align:start position:0%
approach thank you madam chair okay are
 
04:06:52.070 --> 04:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:54.110 --> 04:06:54.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:07:09.229 --> 04:07:09.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:11.090 --> 04:07:11.100 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I'm resident Timothy
 
04:07:12.950 --> 04:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
Horrigan from the Stratford district 10
 
04:07:15.590 --> 04:07:15.600 align:start position:0%
which is just the town of Durham I'm
 
04:07:18.349 --> 04:07:18.359 align:start position:0%
used to representing multiple towns so
 
04:07:20.630 --> 04:07:20.640 align:start position:0%
um I I checked off support with
 
04:07:22.370 --> 04:07:22.380 align:start position:0%
Amendment and though my thinking and
 
04:07:24.950 --> 04:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
this is not much different than uh the
 
04:07:26.570 --> 04:07:26.580 align:start position:0%
other represent the representative who
 
04:07:29.090 --> 04:07:29.100 align:start position:0%
just spoke and in fact last year I uh
 
04:07:31.670 --> 04:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
checked off that I was opposed I think
 
04:07:31.680 --> 04:07:32.809 align:start position:0%
checked off that I was opposed I think
um

04:07:32.809 --> 04:07:32.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:07:34.849 --> 04:07:34.859 align:start position:0%
and the basic issue behind this I think
 
04:07:36.769 --> 04:07:36.779 align:start position:0%
probably does deserve to be Revisited
 
04:07:41.330 --> 04:07:41.340 align:start position:0%
I'm not crazy at all about doing this
 
04:07:42.650 --> 04:07:42.660 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire way
 
04:07:44.330 --> 04:07:44.340 align:start position:0%
um I think the New Hampshire way it
 
04:07:46.550 --> 04:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
usually works but sometimes it doesn't
 
04:07:49.250 --> 04:07:49.260 align:start position:0%
so I don't think paying someone a token
 
04:07:52.550 --> 04:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
125 dollars a year to twiddle their
 
04:07:54.710 --> 04:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
thumbs while waiting for the uh
 
04:07:58.550 --> 04:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
Governor to die or resign is really uh
 
04:08:01.550 --> 04:08:01.560 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's a bad idea even if it
 
04:08:02.990 --> 04:08:03.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't cost anything and I think the
 
04:08:05.030 --> 04:08:05.040 align:start position:0%
cost would be substantial and I frankly
 
04:08:07.670 --> 04:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
would think it would be better
 
04:08:09.229 --> 04:08:09.239 align:start position:0%
to leave that part about the
 
04:08:10.790 --> 04:08:10.800 align:start position:0%
compensation out in which case you could
 
04:08:12.590 --> 04:08:12.600 align:start position:0%
be set the same way the governor's
 
04:08:14.210 --> 04:08:14.220 align:start position:0%
salary is set the Commissioners other
 
04:08:18.530 --> 04:08:18.540 align:start position:0%
words in the biennial budget process and
 
04:08:20.510 --> 04:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
although there you do have the question
 
04:08:22.309 --> 04:08:22.319 align:start position:0%
of what to do with the first lieutenant
 
04:08:24.110 --> 04:08:24.120 align:start position:0%
governor but actually you'll have time
 
04:08:26.750 --> 04:08:26.760 align:start position:0%
to put that in the budget because um
 
04:08:29.269 --> 04:08:29.279 align:start position:0%
the way the time line works for this
 
04:08:32.030 --> 04:08:32.040 align:start position:0%
particular thing so even
 
04:08:35.330 --> 04:08:35.340 align:start position:0%
so even if this passes to people
 
04:08:36.950 --> 04:08:36.960 align:start position:0%
people don't get to vote on it until
 
04:08:39.290 --> 04:08:39.300 align:start position:0%
November 2024 and the ballots aren't
 
04:08:41.389 --> 04:08:41.399 align:start position:0%
printed up until after the state Primary
 
04:08:44.030 --> 04:08:44.040 align:start position:0%
in 2024 so there's a very long
 
04:08:46.309 --> 04:08:46.319 align:start position:0%
you have a lot of time at your disposal
 
04:08:48.170 --> 04:08:48.180 align:start position:0%
um so you don't have to pass this uh
 
04:08:49.729 --> 04:08:49.739 align:start position:0%
there's no point in passing this right
 
04:08:52.429 --> 04:08:52.439 align:start position:0%
away you definitely will want to keep it
 
04:08:53.870 --> 04:08:53.880 align:start position:0%
over the summer and retain it because
 
04:08:56.510 --> 04:08:56.520 align:start position:0%
our some aspects of this transfer of
 
04:08:59.570 --> 04:08:59.580 align:start position:0%
power is probably should be looked at um
 
04:09:02.330 --> 04:09:02.340 align:start position:0%
there is right now if the office of
 
04:09:04.250 --> 04:09:04.260 align:start position:0%
Governor is vacant in the first year of
 
04:09:05.750 --> 04:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
his or her term we have a special
 
04:09:07.610 --> 04:09:07.620 align:start position:0%
election although the president the
 
04:09:09.650 --> 04:09:09.660 align:start position:0%
senate or whoever else is in line serves
 
04:09:11.210 --> 04:09:11.220 align:start position:0%
as the acting governor
 
04:09:14.750 --> 04:09:14.760 align:start position:0%
until such time as there's a election
 
04:09:16.910 --> 04:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
and we might be able I think certainly
 
04:09:19.189 --> 04:09:19.199 align:start position:0%
might be appropriate to push that uh you
 
04:09:21.349 --> 04:09:21.359 align:start position:0%
know into the second year too
 
04:09:22.910 --> 04:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
um at least at some point in the second
 
04:09:24.290 --> 04:09:24.300 align:start position:0%
year um
 
04:09:25.969 --> 04:09:25.979 align:start position:0%
what happened the last time we used this
 
04:09:28.849 --> 04:09:28.859 align:start position:0%
of course uh Senator Morse continue to
 
04:09:31.130 --> 04:09:31.140 align:start position:0%
be the president of the of the Senate as
 
04:09:33.050 --> 04:09:33.060 align:start position:0%
well as the governor acting Governor but
 
04:09:35.229 --> 04:09:35.239 align:start position:0%
that was only for three days and they
 
04:09:38.030 --> 04:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
Governor the current governor he's still
 
04:09:40.309 --> 04:09:40.319 align:start position:0%
there Johnson uh Kristen Nunu had
 
04:09:42.410 --> 04:09:42.420 align:start position:0%
already uh had already been elected and
 
04:09:44.210 --> 04:09:44.220 align:start position:0%
his elections already been certified he
 
04:09:46.670 --> 04:09:46.680 align:start position:0%
was just basically waiting for days for
 
04:09:48.650 --> 04:09:48.660 align:start position:0%
Chris and Nunu to you know be officially
 
04:09:50.870 --> 04:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
declared the governor and I
 
04:09:54.950 --> 04:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
I don't specifically remember whether he
 
04:09:57.530 --> 04:09:57.540 align:start position:0%
sat whether I think president Morse sat
 
04:09:59.450 --> 04:09:59.460 align:start position:0%
with the senate or whether the president
 
04:10:02.030 --> 04:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
pro tem filled in for him for those
 
04:10:05.389 --> 04:10:05.399 align:start position:0%
duties during those few days but the
 
04:10:08.269 --> 04:10:08.279 align:start position:0%
anyway so I say certainly the so there's
 
04:10:10.130 --> 04:10:10.140 align:start position:0%
certainly something maybe you might
 
04:10:12.410 --> 04:10:12.420 align:start position:0%
enjoy looking at and I definitely would
 
04:10:14.689 --> 04:10:14.699 align:start position:0%
uh say it's a bad idea to have a
 
04:10:16.550 --> 04:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
lieutenant governor who has no powers at
 
04:10:18.590 --> 04:10:18.600 align:start position:0%
all and has only paid a token amount I
 
04:10:21.530 --> 04:10:21.540 align:start position:0%
think sounds I know it doesn't sound
 
04:10:22.670 --> 04:10:22.680 align:start position:0%
like the New Hampshire way but I think
 
04:10:23.870 --> 04:10:23.880 align:start position:0%
he should be paid you know an
 
04:10:25.729 --> 04:10:25.739 align:start position:0%
appropriate salary as determined during
 
04:10:28.130 --> 04:10:28.140 align:start position:0%
the budget process just like we did with
 
04:10:29.330 --> 04:10:29.340 align:start position:0%
the governor right now and the
 
04:10:31.550 --> 04:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and I think even the
 
04:10:33.889 --> 04:10:33.899 align:start position:0%
executive counselor's salary said the
 
04:10:36.410 --> 04:10:36.420 align:start position:0%
budget process and
 
04:10:38.330 --> 04:10:38.340 align:start position:0%
you probably will need a staff we'll
 
04:10:40.189 --> 04:10:40.199 align:start position:0%
need a car we'll need a desk and a phone
 
04:10:42.710 --> 04:10:42.720 align:start position:0%
and all that stuff and also you may
 
04:10:44.689 --> 04:10:44.699 align:start position:0%
want to consider if there's any specific
 
04:10:46.610 --> 04:10:46.620 align:start position:0%
Duty you want him or her to do while
 
04:10:48.650 --> 04:10:48.660 align:start position:0%
she's serving as a lieutenant governor
 
04:10:50.210 --> 04:10:50.220 align:start position:0%
uh most
 
04:10:52.910 --> 04:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
states in the United States the uh
 
04:10:55.910 --> 04:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
the vice president or lieutenant
 
04:10:57.349 --> 04:10:57.359 align:start position:0%
governor Service as the president of the
 
04:11:00.530 --> 04:11:00.540 align:start position:0%
Senate that might be an idea or one sort
 
04:11:02.330 --> 04:11:02.340 align:start position:0%
of a joke thing I do which I'm offering
 
04:11:03.650 --> 04:11:03.660 align:start position:0%
to serve as a joke but I've been
 
04:11:05.689 --> 04:11:05.699 align:start position:0%
involved a lot with what's left of the
 
04:11:07.309 --> 04:11:07.319 align:start position:0%
register probate office we might be able
 
04:11:08.809 --> 04:11:08.819 align:start position:0%
to make a lieutenant governor the
 
04:11:11.269 --> 04:11:11.279 align:start position:0%
register of pro Statewide register of
 
04:11:13.910 --> 04:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
probate for all 10 counties but you
 
04:11:15.769 --> 04:11:15.779 align:start position:0%
probably should give him him or her some
 
04:11:17.570 --> 04:11:17.580 align:start position:0%
sort of specific duties to do rather
 
04:11:20.870 --> 04:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
than just sitting at his her desk or
 
04:11:22.550 --> 04:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
maybe not even at his or her desk just
 
04:11:24.290 --> 04:11:24.300 align:start position:0%
in the corner of the governor's ante
 
04:11:25.910 --> 04:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
room twiddling their thumbs just in case
 
04:11:28.550 --> 04:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
the governor uh suddenly is no longer
 
04:11:30.290 --> 04:11:30.300 align:start position:0%
there I don't think that's a good idea
 
04:11:31.670 --> 04:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
so I would
 
04:11:34.010 --> 04:11:34.020 align:start position:0%
I would say uh definitely need some work
 
04:11:36.469 --> 04:11:36.479 align:start position:0%
and if you and this may be an
 
04:11:38.450 --> 04:11:38.460 align:start position:0%
appropriate Bill to retain over the
 
04:11:39.889 --> 04:11:39.899 align:start position:0%
summer but
 
04:11:41.330 --> 04:11:41.340 align:start position:0%
not that we don't have other things to
 
04:11:43.250 --> 04:11:43.260 align:start position:0%
do all summer so thanks a lot if you
 
04:11:45.170 --> 04:11:45.180 align:start position:0%
have any questions I can answer them
 
04:11:49.010 --> 04:11:49.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:50.769 --> 04:11:50.779 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much
 
04:12:00.290 --> 04:12:00.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:02.929 --> 04:12:02.939 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and honorable
 
04:12:05.210 --> 04:12:05.220 align:start position:0%
colleagues it's fun to be back at Edna
 
04:12:07.309 --> 04:12:07.319 align:start position:0%
I've missed you all
 
04:12:09.830 --> 04:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
um for those of you returning
 
04:12:12.469 --> 04:12:12.479 align:start position:0%
um I'm gonna make three quick brief
 
04:12:12.479 --> 04:12:14.269 align:start position:0%
um I'm gonna make three quick brief
points

04:12:14.269 --> 04:12:14.279 align:start position:0%
points
 
04:12:17.090 --> 04:12:17.100 align:start position:0%
um this again to underline the fact that
 
04:12:20.570 --> 04:12:20.580 align:start position:0%
this is a bipartisan bill
 
04:12:23.630 --> 04:12:23.640 align:start position:0%
um the fact that the Civics component
 
04:12:25.610 --> 04:12:25.620 align:start position:0%
and the engagement component for the
 
04:12:28.790 --> 04:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
executive branch is a positive thing
 
04:12:31.130 --> 04:12:31.140 align:start position:0%
the design maybe if I'd written the bill
 
04:12:32.929 --> 04:12:32.939 align:start position:0%
would be a little different maybe a
 
04:12:35.330 --> 04:12:35.340 align:start position:0%
little more staff or something but
 
04:12:38.809 --> 04:12:38.819 align:start position:0%
honestly the approach that the
 
04:12:41.990 --> 04:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
representative from Loudon wrote it is
 
04:12:44.510 --> 04:12:44.520 align:start position:0%
very New Hampshire and it's unfair to
 
04:12:46.189 --> 04:12:46.199 align:start position:0%
compare New Hampshire to other states
 
04:12:49.790 --> 04:12:49.800 align:start position:0%
given how we do things for example
 
04:12:53.030 --> 04:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
uh New York state is considering raising
 
04:12:55.070 --> 04:12:55.080 align:start position:0%
their legislators pay to over a hundred
 
04:12:57.410 --> 04:12:57.420 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars that has never come up
 
04:13:00.110 --> 04:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
in this state as any Factor whatsoever
 
04:13:03.229 --> 04:13:03.239 align:start position:0%
to raise our pay I think it's just fair
 
04:13:06.530 --> 04:13:06.540 align:start position:0%
to look at the New Hampshire way and I
 
04:13:08.450 --> 04:13:08.460 align:start position:0%
think that this approach
 
04:13:12.769 --> 04:13:12.779 align:start position:0%
has no negatives it is pure positive
 
04:13:15.110 --> 04:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
and I could see a scenario where a
 
04:13:17.330 --> 04:13:17.340 align:start position:0%
current governor could pick someone as
 
04:13:20.570 --> 04:13:20.580 align:start position:0%
wise and gravitudinal as the
 
04:13:22.610 --> 04:13:22.620 align:start position:0%
representative from Loudon imagine
 
04:13:25.490 --> 04:13:25.500 align:start position:0%
having someone else to assist on
 
04:13:27.950 --> 04:13:27.960 align:start position:0%
important topics such as veterans issues
 
04:13:30.830 --> 04:13:30.840 align:start position:0%
who has served in the military I think
 
04:13:32.630 --> 04:13:32.640 align:start position:0%
that's a great uh
 
04:13:34.910 --> 04:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
a great option to have
 
04:13:37.550 --> 04:13:37.560 align:start position:0%
so that's it I hope I kept it to the 30
 
04:13:39.769 --> 04:13:39.779 align:start position:0%
seconds I promised but I think this is a
 
04:13:42.410 --> 04:13:42.420 align:start position:0%
great idea and it is a bipartisan bill
 
04:13:45.889 --> 04:13:45.899 align:start position:0%
with no drawbacks as far as I see it
 
04:13:47.510 --> 04:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
 
04:13:47.520 --> 04:13:50.929 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
questions

04:13:50.929 --> 04:13:50.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:52.729 --> 04:13:52.739 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none
 
04:13:55.670 --> 04:13:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:57.650 --> 04:13:57.660 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who would like to
 
04:14:01.790 --> 04:14:01.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:04.309 --> 04:14:04.319 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none I will close the
 
04:14:07.250 --> 04:14:07.260 align:start position:0%
public hearing and thank you all for
 
04:14:10.630 --> 04:14:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:14.330 --> 04:14:14.340 align:start position:0%
and the committee will resume on
