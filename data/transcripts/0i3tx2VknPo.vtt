00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
but uh then once i was assigned up this
 
00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
way uh
 
00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:31.120 align:start position:0%
after several years and when we had four
 
00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
kids before we had five
 
00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:35.200 align:start position:0%
my wife said we weren't moving so uh and
 
00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:36.720 align:start position:0%
that was good for me because we really
 
00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:37.840 align:start position:0%
liked the place
 
00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:41.120 align:start position:0%
it's a good place to be um and that was
 
00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:42.480 align:start position:0%
back like i said back in
 
00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
well in 76 is when we moved here
 
00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
so um i was uh
 
00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:50.320 align:start position:0%
basically like i said worked uh
 
00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
construction most of my life i was also
 
00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
in the service
 
00:27:56.230 --> 00:27:56.240 align:start position:0%
uh i was kind of in the army in the 60s
 
00:27:58.630 --> 00:27:58.640 align:start position:0%
for a few years that's a long story but
 
00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
then i was in the navy for a little over
 
00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:02.230 align:start position:0%
then i was in the navy for a little over
25

00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:02.240 align:start position:0%
25
 
00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:04.640 align:start position:0%
um they finally kicked me out when i
 
00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
turned 62 and 09
 
00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
and i was very fortunate to uh work with
 
00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:11.200 align:start position:0%
again construction side
 
00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:14.720 align:start position:0%
with the seabees the whole time
 
00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:16.960 align:start position:0%
and uh i was very fortunate to be
 
00:28:18.389 --> 00:28:18.399 align:start position:0%
assigned to go to several
 
00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:22.240 align:start position:0%

get to go normally
 
00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:52.080 align:start position:0%

00:45:53.829 --> 00:45:53.839 align:start position:0%
getting
 
00:45:56.150 --> 00:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
we'll talk about the workload a little
 
00:45:59.270 --> 00:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:01.589 --> 00:46:01.599 align:start position:0%
everybody took less time than i thought
 
00:46:03.589 --> 00:46:03.599 align:start position:0%
i thought we'd spend at least an hour on
 
00:46:04.309 --> 00:46:04.319 align:start position:0%
this if
 
00:46:07.430 --> 00:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
23 members at three minutes each but
 
00:46:08.230 --> 00:46:08.240 align:start position:0%
that's okay
 
00:46:11.589 --> 00:46:11.599 align:start position:0%
we're going to go forward um
 
00:46:14.870 --> 00:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
the only thing i'm going to ask is
 
00:46:19.270 --> 00:46:19.280 align:start position:0%
if you leave the meeting for some reason
 
00:46:22.309 --> 00:46:22.319 align:start position:0%
just make that known if you have to
 
00:46:23.589 --> 00:46:23.599 align:start position:0%
leave for
 
00:46:26.630 --> 00:46:26.640 align:start position:0%
a break of some kind
 
00:46:29.990 --> 00:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
darken your screen so that we know that
 
00:46:32.870 --> 00:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
that's the reason and uh mr vice
 
00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
chairman if mine goes dark you're in
 
00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:37.190 align:start position:0%
chairman if mine goes dark you're in
charge

00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
charge
 
00:46:41.589 --> 00:46:41.599 align:start position:0%
um let's go over some of the uh
 
00:46:43.349 --> 00:46:43.359 align:start position:0%
the ground rules now that we've gotten
 
00:46:44.950 --> 00:46:44.960 align:start position:0%
to know each other
 
00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:48.720 align:start position:0%
and you're really getting a little bit
 
00:46:51.430 --> 00:46:51.440 align:start position:0%
short changed by doing it via zoom
 
00:46:53.589 --> 00:46:53.599 align:start position:0%
because a lot of the relationships are
 
00:46:56.790 --> 00:46:56.800 align:start position:0%
built as we have a cup of coffee
 
00:46:58.550 --> 00:46:58.560 align:start position:0%
during breaks in the committee and the
 
00:47:01.589 --> 00:47:01.599 align:start position:0%
rest and you just talk with people
 
00:47:04.390 --> 00:47:04.400 align:start position:0%
we will start doing that uh sometime in
 
00:47:05.829 --> 00:47:05.839 align:start position:0%
the near future
 
00:47:07.750 --> 00:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
and we'll talk about that in a little
 
00:47:10.390 --> 00:47:10.400 align:start position:0%
bit as well
 
00:47:13.990 --> 00:47:14.000 align:start position:0%
um the idea
 
00:47:18.390 --> 00:47:18.400 align:start position:0%
um is that all of our meetings
 
00:47:21.910 --> 00:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
will be noticed in the house calendar
 
00:47:25.589 --> 00:47:25.599 align:start position:0%
whether it's in person or uh
 
00:47:30.230 --> 00:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
remotely via zoom and they will appear
 
00:47:33.670 --> 00:47:33.680 align:start position:0%
and it's my goal to start on time
 
00:47:35.670 --> 00:47:35.680 align:start position:0%
i know a couple times when i filled in
 
00:47:38.549 --> 00:47:38.559 align:start position:0%
his chair over the years people would
 
00:47:39.430 --> 00:47:39.440 align:start position:0%
water back
 
00:47:41.910 --> 00:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
after lunch when the calendar said we
 
00:47:44.150 --> 00:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
started at one they'd show up at
 
00:47:47.829 --> 00:47:47.839 align:start position:0%
110 and i'd already started the meeting
 
00:47:49.990 --> 00:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
so if it's in the calendar to start at a
 
00:47:51.190 --> 00:47:51.200 align:start position:0%
certain time
 
00:47:54.790 --> 00:47:54.800 align:start position:0%
i i do want to start on time um
 
00:47:58.309 --> 00:47:58.319 align:start position:0%
if at all possible
 
00:48:01.829 --> 00:48:01.839 align:start position:0%
um second i think did everybody
 
00:48:04.710 --> 00:48:04.720 align:start position:0%
see the email from the house clerk about
 
00:48:07.270 --> 00:48:07.280 align:start position:0%
an email address
 
00:48:09.510 --> 00:48:09.520 align:start position:0%
where he asks that you have a single
 
00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:10.470 align:start position:0%
where he asks that you have a single
email

00:48:10.470 --> 00:48:10.480 align:start position:0%
email
 
00:48:13.750 --> 00:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
for all of this so that notices that
 
00:48:14.390 --> 00:48:14.400 align:start position:0%
come out
 
00:48:17.270 --> 00:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
about committee meetings because you
 
00:48:20.390 --> 00:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
will get notified whether it's in person
 
00:48:24.309 --> 00:48:24.319 align:start position:0%
or zoom or if you have a bill being
 
00:48:24.319 --> 00:48:25.190 align:start position:0%
or zoom or if you have a bill being
heard

00:48:25.190 --> 00:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
heard
 
00:48:30.069 --> 00:48:30.079 align:start position:0%
you'll also be notified electronically
 
00:48:31.990 --> 00:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
i know in the past some members have
 
00:48:35.109 --> 00:48:35.119 align:start position:0%
said oh committee should use
 
00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:39.680 align:start position:0%
uh billy bob at uh gmail.com and not
 
00:48:40.309 --> 00:48:40.319 align:start position:0%
what was
 
00:48:44.390 --> 00:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
listed on the house um website
 
00:48:47.510 --> 00:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
the clerk the speaker and i all ask that
 
00:48:48.710 --> 00:48:48.720 align:start position:0%
you pick one
 
00:48:52.069 --> 00:48:52.079 align:start position:0%
and use it because when i send an email
 
00:48:54.630 --> 00:48:54.640 align:start position:0%
out all i'm going to do is go to the
 
00:48:59.349 --> 00:48:59.359 align:start position:0%
the public works page on the house
 
00:49:02.150 --> 00:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
site and just hit the button that says
 
00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:02.790 align:start position:0%
site and just hit the button that says
email

00:49:02.790 --> 00:49:02.800 align:start position:0%
email
 
00:49:06.309 --> 00:49:06.319 align:start position:0%
all um committee members it's just so
 
00:49:07.670 --> 00:49:07.680 align:start position:0%
much easier
 
00:49:10.630 --> 00:49:10.640 align:start position:0%
um so hopefully that will be the way
 
00:49:11.990 --> 00:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
that it is
 
00:49:15.270 --> 00:49:15.280 align:start position:0%
um but let me know and let the court a
 
00:49:15.990 --> 00:49:16.000 align:start position:0%
house clerk
 
00:49:18.950 --> 00:49:18.960 align:start position:0%
know more importantly if the one that is
 
00:49:20.390 --> 00:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
on your web page
 
00:49:22.630 --> 00:49:22.640 align:start position:0%
is not the one that you want use for all
 
00:49:25.430 --> 00:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
of this type of thing
 
00:49:29.430 --> 00:49:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:30.870 --> 00:49:30.880 align:start position:0%
if you have a question you can do it
 
00:49:32.870 --> 00:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
either way just
 
00:49:34.309 --> 00:49:34.319 align:start position:0%
raise your hand or there's a little
 
00:49:36.390 --> 00:49:36.400 align:start position:0%
raise your hand button at the bottom
 
00:49:41.829 --> 00:49:41.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:43.990 --> 00:49:44.000 align:start position:0%
are you on the phone are you talking
 
00:49:45.190 --> 00:49:45.200 align:start position:0%
never mind
 
00:49:52.390 --> 00:49:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:56.829 --> 00:49:56.839 align:start position:0%
yeah he's on the phone okay
 
00:50:00.390 --> 00:50:00.400 align:start position:0%
um public meetings whether it's via zoom
 
00:50:03.030 --> 00:50:03.040 align:start position:0%
or in person are just that they're open
 
00:50:04.549 --> 00:50:04.559 align:start position:0%
to the public
 
00:50:07.750 --> 00:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
and we are representatives not only of
 
00:50:09.190 --> 00:50:09.200 align:start position:0%
our own town
 
00:50:12.790 --> 00:50:12.800 align:start position:0%
but also the entire state so please
 
00:50:15.990 --> 00:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
dress accordingly i know that there
 
00:50:21.510 --> 00:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
is not a formal dress code for the house
 
00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
but it is expected both on the house
 
00:50:24.790 --> 00:50:24.800 align:start position:0%
floor and
 
00:50:26.630 --> 00:50:26.640 align:start position:0%
in committee that you dress
 
00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:27.990 align:start position:0%
in committee that you dress
appropriately

00:50:27.990 --> 00:50:28.000 align:start position:0%
appropriately
 
00:50:31.190 --> 00:50:31.200 align:start position:0%
and for many many years and
 
00:50:33.750 --> 00:50:33.760 align:start position:0%
for me at least that means coat and tie
 
00:50:35.349 --> 00:50:35.359 align:start position:0%
for the gentleman and i'm not going to
 
00:50:37.030 --> 00:50:37.040 align:start position:0%
try to tell the ladies what is
 
00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:38.710 align:start position:0%
try to tell the ladies what is
appropriate

00:50:38.710 --> 00:50:38.720 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
00:50:41.910 --> 00:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
we've been down that one before uh
 
00:50:45.589 --> 00:50:45.599 align:start position:0%
but um please um do that
 
00:50:48.630 --> 00:50:48.640 align:start position:0%
and decorum is important um we're not
 
00:50:52.549 --> 00:50:52.559 align:start position:0%
there um as our for our personal
 
00:50:55.589 --> 00:50:55.599 align:start position:0%
uh agendas on the committee
 
00:50:57.670 --> 00:50:57.680 align:start position:0%
we may have bills in on various other
 
00:51:00.470 --> 00:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
committees that express what you want
 
00:51:04.069 --> 00:51:04.079 align:start position:0%
but please no talking across
 
00:51:07.270 --> 00:51:07.280 align:start position:0%
other people while testimony is going on
 
00:51:09.430 --> 00:51:09.440 align:start position:0%
and we'll get into how that works in
 
00:51:11.750 --> 00:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
just a few minutes but
 
00:51:15.190 --> 00:51:15.200 align:start position:0%
you are representative of the house
 
00:51:18.630 --> 00:51:18.640 align:start position:0%
and anything you say or do will probably
 
00:51:20.870 --> 00:51:20.880 align:start position:0%
be recorded by somebody
 
00:51:24.630 --> 00:51:24.640 align:start position:0%
and if it's not great we will all hear
 
00:51:27.589 --> 00:51:27.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:31.750 --> 00:51:31.760 align:start position:0%
so when we get into the
 
00:51:35.190 --> 00:51:35.200 align:start position:0%
legislative uh office building there is
 
00:51:36.630 --> 00:51:36.640 align:start position:0%
a committee room
 
00:51:39.829 --> 00:51:39.839 align:start position:0%
that has drawers the returning members
 
00:51:41.670 --> 00:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
whichever committee will know what i'm
 
00:51:44.950 --> 00:51:44.960 align:start position:0%
talking about where you can store things
 
00:51:48.710 --> 00:51:48.720 align:start position:0%
those will not be open until we resume
 
00:51:49.990 --> 00:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
normal operations
 
00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
within the state within the state house
 
00:51:56.230 --> 00:51:56.240 align:start position:0%
complex so
 
00:51:59.349 --> 00:51:59.359 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to drag your stuff
 
00:52:01.990 --> 00:52:02.000 align:start position:0%
back and forth every day that we have
 
00:52:05.109 --> 00:52:05.119 align:start position:0%
meetings in concord just be aware of
 
00:52:05.119 --> 00:52:06.390 align:start position:0%
meetings in concord just be aware of
that

00:52:06.390 --> 00:52:06.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:52:08.790 --> 00:52:08.800 align:start position:0%
it looks like it's going to be probably
 
00:52:10.150 --> 00:52:10.160 align:start position:0%
after crossover
 
00:52:11.750 --> 00:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
hopefully everybody remembers what
 
00:52:13.190 --> 00:52:13.200 align:start position:0%
crossover is
 
00:52:16.390 --> 00:52:16.400 align:start position:0%
before we really get everything um under
 
00:52:19.670 --> 00:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
control within the entire complex
 
00:52:21.990 --> 00:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
and that's just a function of being
 
00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:23.349 align:start position:0%
and that's just a function of being
vaccinated

00:52:23.349 --> 00:52:23.359 align:start position:0%
vaccinated
 
00:52:27.270 --> 00:52:27.280 align:start position:0%
and the rest um but once we get into
 
00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:27.670 align:start position:0%
and the rest um but once we get into
them

00:52:27.670 --> 00:52:27.680 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:52:29.430 --> 00:52:29.440 align:start position:0%
you're free to leave whatever you want
 
00:52:31.670 --> 00:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
in there please don't leave too much
 
00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:32.069 align:start position:0%
in there please don't leave too much
food

00:52:32.069 --> 00:52:32.079 align:start position:0%
food
 
00:52:34.549 --> 00:52:34.559 align:start position:0%
because there is the potential for mice
 
00:52:36.150 --> 00:52:36.160 align:start position:0%
and ants and
 
00:52:38.470 --> 00:52:38.480 align:start position:0%
other things which has happened in other
 
00:52:39.510 --> 00:52:39.520 align:start position:0%
committees and not
 
00:52:42.309 --> 00:52:42.319 align:start position:0%
ours um and please don't lock them and
 
00:52:42.950 --> 00:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
take the
 
00:52:45.670 --> 00:52:45.680 align:start position:0%
the key with you um sometimes you'll
 
00:52:45.680 --> 00:52:45.990 align:start position:0%
the key with you um sometimes you'll
lock

00:52:45.990 --> 00:52:46.000 align:start position:0%
lock
 
00:52:48.630 --> 00:52:48.640 align:start position:0%
it and then other members um drawers
 
00:52:50.710 --> 00:52:50.720 align:start position:0%
will even not close all the way or won't
 
00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:51.589 align:start position:0%
will even not close all the way or won't
open

00:52:51.589 --> 00:52:51.599 align:start position:0%
open
 
00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
um if you're going to don't like the key
 
00:52:56.470 --> 00:52:56.480 align:start position:0%

i know that in some of the literature it
says

00:53:16.230 --> 00:53:16.240 align:start position:0%

the only ones that can't change are
myself

00:53:39.510 --> 00:53:39.520 align:start position:0%

head of the table and then we'll also go
 
00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:03.349 align:start position:0%
head of the table and then we'll also go

the first are there any questions about
 
00:54:13.670 --> 00:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
just kind of ground rules and decorum
 
00:54:17.829 --> 00:54:17.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:21.349 --> 00:54:21.359 align:start position:0%
and okay moving on
 
00:54:24.710 --> 00:54:24.720 align:start position:0%
the committee um i
 
00:54:27.990 --> 00:54:28.000 align:start position:0%
have been told by the speaker to do this
 
00:54:31.670 --> 00:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
rule 30 is the charge to the committee
 
00:54:33.910 --> 00:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
it shall be the duty of the committee on
 
00:54:35.670 --> 00:54:35.680 align:start position:0%

00:54:49.510 --> 00:54:49.520 align:start position:0%
the capital budget matters pertaining to
 
00:54:51.430 --> 00:54:51.440 align:start position:0%

00:54:53.829 --> 00:54:53.839 align:start position:0%
capital expenditures related to the
 
00:54:55.510 --> 00:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
improvement and preservation of the
 
00:54:55.520 --> 00:54:56.789 align:start position:0%
improvement and preservation of the
coastline

00:54:56.789 --> 00:54:56.799 align:start position:0%

monuments and such
 
00:55:03.510 --> 00:55:03.520 align:start position:0%
other matters as may be referred to
 
00:55:04.309 --> 00:55:04.319 align:start position:0%
that's kind of in
 
00:55:06.230 --> 00:55:06.240 align:start position:0%
a nutshell it kind of explains
 
00:55:09.510 --> 00:55:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:14.390 --> 00:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:17.510 --> 00:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
bills here in a few minutes hopefully
 
00:55:21.349 --> 00:55:21.359 align:start position:0%
everybody has looked at the house rules
 
00:55:24.870 --> 00:55:24.880 align:start position:0%
either in preparation for our last
 
00:55:24.880 --> 00:55:25.670 align:start position:0%
either in preparation for our last
session

00:55:25.670 --> 00:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:55:28.150 --> 00:55:28.160 align:start position:0%
and what changes were being proposed or
 
00:55:29.270 --> 00:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
not proposed
 
00:55:32.309 --> 00:55:32.319 align:start position:0%
or not passed but
 
00:55:35.270 --> 00:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
there are important pieces in there to
 
00:55:38.470 --> 00:55:38.480 align:start position:0%
include the responsibilities of members
 
00:55:42.470 --> 00:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
on committees as you looked at the
 
00:55:42.480 --> 00:55:43.030 align:start position:0%
on committees as you looked at the
makeup

00:55:43.030 --> 00:55:43.040 align:start position:0%
makeup
 
00:55:46.230 --> 00:55:46.240 align:start position:0%
and listened to the roll call
 
00:55:49.270 --> 00:55:49.280 align:start position:0%
we have a larger committee than usual
 
00:55:52.390 --> 00:55:52.400 align:start position:0%
we have 23 members which makes it one of
 
00:55:55.670 --> 00:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
the largest um committees in the house
 
00:55:58.069 --> 00:55:58.079 align:start position:0%
we're larger than the finance committee
 
00:56:02.710 --> 00:56:02.720 align:start position:0%
at the moment and the partisan breakout
 
00:56:05.990 --> 00:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
is 12 republicans 11 democrats
 
00:56:10.390 --> 00:56:10.400 align:start position:0%
um so i don't know what that means
 
00:56:12.789 --> 00:56:12.799 align:start position:0%
when we come down to voting but i do
 
00:56:14.390 --> 00:56:14.400 align:start position:0%
know that it means that
 
00:56:16.309 --> 00:56:16.319 align:start position:0%
the the speaker when i talked to him
 
00:56:18.789 --> 00:56:18.799 align:start position:0%
about it said that we work collegially
 
00:56:21.109 --> 00:56:21.119 align:start position:0%
so we could work out our differences
 
00:56:24.230 --> 00:56:24.240 align:start position:0%
and get things passed as um
 
00:56:26.390 --> 00:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
the the clerk and the vice chair have
 
00:56:27.750 --> 00:56:27.760 align:start position:0%
said in the in
 
00:56:31.589 --> 00:56:31.599 align:start position:0%
their opening remarks we tried to get
 
00:56:32.309 --> 00:56:32.319 align:start position:0%
things out
 
00:56:35.510 --> 00:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
and representative clutier also talked
 
00:56:36.390 --> 00:56:36.400 align:start position:0%
about this
 
00:56:38.710 --> 00:56:38.720 align:start position:0%
we try to get things out on a consensus
 
00:56:38.720 --> 00:56:40.309 align:start position:0%
we try to get things out on a consensus
basis

00:56:40.309 --> 00:56:40.319 align:start position:0%
basis
 
00:56:42.710 --> 00:56:42.720 align:start position:0%
we don't always all agree and there have
 
00:56:44.309 --> 00:56:44.319 align:start position:0%
been you know
 
00:56:46.950 --> 00:56:46.960 align:start position:0%
um times where we've we've had partisan
 
00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:47.750 align:start position:0%
um times where we've we've had partisan
fights

00:56:47.750 --> 00:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
fights
 
00:56:50.309 --> 00:56:50.319 align:start position:0%
um the one that comes to mind to me is
 
00:56:52.069 --> 00:56:52.079 align:start position:0%
uh passenger rail
 
00:56:54.390 --> 00:56:54.400 align:start position:0%
and whether or not to to go forward with
 
00:56:54.400 --> 00:56:55.109 align:start position:0%
and whether or not to to go forward with
that

00:56:55.109 --> 00:56:55.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:56:58.470 --> 00:56:58.480 align:start position:0%
um if that is a partisan issue
 
00:57:02.390 --> 00:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
but by and large most of ours come out
 
00:57:05.510 --> 00:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
when we had 20 or 19 to one or 18 to
 
00:57:05.520 --> 00:57:06.309 align:start position:0%
when we had 20 or 19 to one or 18 to
zero

00:57:06.309 --> 00:57:06.319 align:start position:0%
zero
 
00:57:09.430 --> 00:57:09.440 align:start position:0%
depending on who was there and it just
 
00:57:11.670 --> 00:57:11.680 align:start position:0%
makes it easier to work
 
00:57:13.750 --> 00:57:13.760 align:start position:0%
on the floor of the house to to get
 
00:57:14.950 --> 00:57:14.960 align:start position:0%
things done
 
00:57:16.950 --> 00:57:16.960 align:start position:0%
if we can reach consensus through
 
00:57:16.960 --> 00:57:18.630 align:start position:0%
if we can reach consensus through
amendments

00:57:18.630 --> 00:57:18.640 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
00:57:24.150 --> 00:57:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:26.470 --> 00:57:26.480 align:start position:0%
any questions on the charge to the
 
00:57:26.480 --> 00:57:30.630 align:start position:0%
any questions on the charge to the
committee

00:57:30.630 --> 00:57:30.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:33.670 --> 00:57:33.680 align:start position:0%
okay let's talk about
 
00:57:35.670 --> 00:57:35.680 align:start position:0%
typical bills and if any of the
 
00:57:37.910 --> 00:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
returning members want to chime in while
 
00:57:43.190 --> 00:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:45.510 --> 00:57:45.520 align:start position:0%
capital budget is the big one that we'll
 
00:57:47.270 --> 00:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
be dealing with
 
00:57:50.789 --> 00:57:50.799 align:start position:0%
um the first part of this year
 
00:57:54.630 --> 00:57:54.640 align:start position:0%
that is equivalent to i think
 
00:57:56.549 --> 00:57:56.559 align:start position:0%
representative clutier has always said
 
00:57:57.829 --> 00:57:57.839 align:start position:0%
12 to 15
 
00:58:00.630 --> 00:58:00.640 align:start position:0%
or somewhere in that regular bills
 
00:58:02.470 --> 00:58:02.480 align:start position:0%
because what it is
 
00:58:07.030 --> 00:58:07.040 align:start position:0%
it's a 140 plus or minus million dollars
 
00:58:10.789 --> 00:58:10.799 align:start position:0%
worth of bonding um
 
00:58:13.430 --> 00:58:13.440 align:start position:0%
of state money for capital improvements
 
00:58:15.109 --> 00:58:15.119 align:start position:0%
across the state
 
00:58:18.309 --> 00:58:18.319 align:start position:0%
the governor will give us that um his
 
00:58:19.990 --> 00:58:20.000 align:start position:0%
proposal on that
 
00:58:23.349 --> 00:58:23.359 align:start position:0%
on the 15th of february by law he has to
 
00:58:25.589 --> 00:58:25.599 align:start position:0%
give it to us not later than the 15th of
 
00:58:25.599 --> 00:58:26.630 align:start position:0%
give it to us not later than the 15th of
february

00:58:26.630 --> 00:58:26.640 align:start position:0%
february
 
00:58:29.910 --> 00:58:29.920 align:start position:0%
along with the operating budget at which
 
00:58:29.920 --> 00:58:30.710 align:start position:0%
along with the operating budget at which
point

00:58:30.710 --> 00:58:30.720 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:58:35.349 --> 00:58:35.359 align:start position:0%
um i will get it turned into a bill
 
00:58:37.030 --> 00:58:37.040 align:start position:0%
and then we begin to hold public
 
00:58:39.030 --> 00:58:39.040 align:start position:0%
hearings on
 
00:58:42.309 --> 00:58:42.319 align:start position:0%
um that we will hear from
 
00:58:45.510 --> 00:58:45.520 align:start position:0%
virtually every state agency
 
00:58:48.309 --> 00:58:48.319 align:start position:0%
not only on what is in the the capital
 
00:58:50.630 --> 00:58:50.640 align:start position:0%
budget is proposed by the governor
 
00:58:53.349 --> 00:58:53.359 align:start position:0%
but also what they would like to have in
 
00:58:53.359 --> 00:58:53.910 align:start position:0%
but also what they would like to have in
it

00:58:53.910 --> 00:58:53.920 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:58:55.829 --> 00:58:55.839 align:start position:0%
and when i say agency it's not just
 
00:58:58.470 --> 00:58:58.480 align:start position:0%
state agencies we'll hear from the
 
00:59:01.750 --> 00:59:01.760 align:start position:0%
community college system the university
 
00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:02.950 align:start position:0%
community college system the university
system

00:59:02.950 --> 00:59:02.960 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:59:05.670 --> 00:59:05.680 align:start position:0%
and some others along the way that we
 
00:59:07.349 --> 00:59:07.359 align:start position:0%
have supported in the past
 
00:59:10.710 --> 00:59:10.720 align:start position:0%
with with capital expenditures um just
 
00:59:13.829 --> 00:59:13.839 align:start position:0%
be aware that if people reach out to you
 
00:59:17.270 --> 00:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
about the capital budget you can commit
 
00:59:19.030 --> 00:59:19.040 align:start position:0%
your vote on something
 
00:59:22.230 --> 00:59:22.240 align:start position:0%
but you can't commit the the committee
 
00:59:24.630 --> 00:59:24.640 align:start position:0%
the committee vote at the end on the
 
00:59:26.710 --> 00:59:26.720 align:start position:0%
capital budget is what commits
 
00:59:30.309 --> 00:59:30.319 align:start position:0%
the um committee
 
00:59:32.549 --> 00:59:32.559 align:start position:0%
on what we're doing with the cup capital
 
00:59:32.559 --> 00:59:33.910 align:start position:0%
on what we're doing with the cup capital
budget

00:59:33.910 --> 00:59:33.920 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:59:37.030 --> 00:59:37.040 align:start position:0%
it will take time it will be
 
00:59:39.190 --> 00:59:39.200 align:start position:0%
um we'll talk about how the hearings are
 
00:59:40.630 --> 00:59:40.640 align:start position:0%
going to be conducted here in a few
 
00:59:40.640 --> 00:59:41.430 align:start position:0%
going to be conducted here in a few
minutes

00:59:41.430 --> 00:59:41.440 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
00:59:44.069 --> 00:59:44.079 align:start position:0%
but it's going to be a challenge to do
 
00:59:44.079 --> 00:59:44.950 align:start position:0%
but it's going to be a challenge to do
that

00:59:44.950 --> 00:59:44.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:59:47.030 --> 00:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
in the current environment hearing from
 
00:59:48.309 --> 00:59:48.319 align:start position:0%
every agency
 
00:59:50.309 --> 00:59:50.319 align:start position:0%
and i'm still working with the speaker
 
00:59:53.430 --> 00:59:53.440 align:start position:0%
on how we we get to do that
 
00:59:57.109 --> 00:59:57.119 align:start position:0%
um speaking of the capital budget
 
00:59:59.990 --> 01:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
there is a long-standing tradition
 
01:00:01.829 --> 01:00:01.839 align:start position:0%
within this committee
 
01:00:05.510 --> 01:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:09.190 --> 01:00:09.200 align:start position:0%
pass capital expenditure requests
 
01:00:12.470 --> 01:00:12.480 align:start position:0%
outside of the capital budget
 
01:00:15.270 --> 01:00:15.280 align:start position:0%
that's only so that we have a handle on
 
01:00:16.710 --> 01:00:16.720 align:start position:0%
state bonding
 
01:00:19.589 --> 01:00:19.599 align:start position:0%
and what our debt service will be in the
 
01:00:20.950 --> 01:00:20.960 align:start position:0%
ongoing years
 
01:00:23.270 --> 01:00:23.280 align:start position:0%
i know that there are two bills that are
 
01:00:25.349 --> 01:00:25.359 align:start position:0%
currently assigned to the committee
 
01:00:29.190 --> 01:00:29.200 align:start position:0%
that ask for that for additional capital
 
01:00:30.950 --> 01:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
expenditures outside of the capital
 
01:00:33.990 --> 01:00:34.000 align:start position:0%
budget we will have to deal with those
 
01:00:36.630 --> 01:00:36.640 align:start position:0%
in the very near future um hopefully
 
01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:38.069 align:start position:0%
in the very near future um hopefully
before

01:00:38.069 --> 01:00:38.079 align:start position:0%
before
 
01:00:40.870 --> 01:00:40.880 align:start position:0%
the 15th of february and i'm guilty
 
01:00:43.430 --> 01:00:43.440 align:start position:0%
because one of them i am the sponsor of
 
01:00:46.870 --> 01:00:46.880 align:start position:0%
uh but um
 
01:00:49.990 --> 01:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
do i have any questions about the the
 
01:00:55.190 --> 01:00:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:59.349 --> 01:00:59.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:01.670 --> 01:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
and this is unusual for the committee i
 
01:01:02.710 --> 01:01:02.720 align:start position:0%
will say this
 
01:01:04.309 --> 01:01:04.319 align:start position:0%
because if we were sitting around the
 
01:01:06.069 --> 01:01:06.079 align:start position:0%
table there would be questions and
 
01:01:06.079 --> 01:01:06.950 align:start position:0%
table there would be questions and
comments

01:01:06.950 --> 01:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
comments
 
01:01:09.349 --> 01:01:09.359 align:start position:0%
i know looks like a representative wants
 
01:01:10.470 --> 01:01:10.480 align:start position:0%
to speak
 
01:01:14.150 --> 01:01:14.160 align:start position:0%
barry go ahead and excuse me if i seem
 
01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:15.190 align:start position:0%
barry go ahead and excuse me if i seem
informal

01:01:15.190 --> 01:01:15.200 align:start position:0%
informal
 
01:01:17.670 --> 01:01:17.680 align:start position:0%
but during these work sessions that we
 
01:01:19.270 --> 01:01:19.280 align:start position:0%
have just within
 
01:01:22.470 --> 01:01:22.480 align:start position:0%
the committee um we tend to be a little
 
01:01:24.630 --> 01:01:24.640 align:start position:0%
less formal um
 
01:01:26.230 --> 01:01:26.240 align:start position:0%
and especially after we've gotten to
 
01:01:28.710 --> 01:01:28.720 align:start position:0%
know each other and i've known
 
01:01:31.829 --> 01:01:31.839 align:start position:0%
representative faulkner for more than a
 
01:01:33.030 --> 01:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
couple terms now
 
01:01:36.069 --> 01:01:36.079 align:start position:0%
so i i know he does not take offense
 
01:01:37.910 --> 01:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
when i say barry you can
 
01:01:41.349 --> 01:01:41.359 align:start position:0%
not move it uh
 
01:01:42.549 --> 01:01:42.559 align:start position:0%
if you might want to go over what we're
 
01:01:43.829 --> 01:01:43.839 align:start position:0%
going to hear from the treasurer in
 
01:01:45.190 --> 01:01:45.200 align:start position:0%
terms of our bonding limit
 
01:01:47.030 --> 01:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
and how much flexibility we actually
 
01:01:48.630 --> 01:01:48.640 align:start position:0%
have to deal with that i think that
 
01:01:49.430 --> 01:01:49.440 align:start position:0%
might be
 
01:01:52.630 --> 01:01:52.640 align:start position:0%
a good guide
 
01:01:54.470 --> 01:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
well actually the treasurer will be on
 
01:01:56.390 --> 01:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
with this later this morning
 
01:01:58.230 --> 01:01:58.240 align:start position:0%
um she will talk about how she
 
01:01:58.240 --> 01:01:59.829 align:start position:0%
um she will talk about how she
determines

01:01:59.829 --> 01:01:59.839 align:start position:0%
determines
 
01:02:02.470 --> 01:02:02.480 align:start position:0%
the amount of money we can borrow in any
 
01:02:04.150 --> 01:02:04.160 align:start position:0%
given biennium
 
01:02:06.630 --> 01:02:06.640 align:start position:0%
and that deals primarily with
 
01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:07.750 align:start position:0%
and that deals primarily with
projections

01:02:07.750 --> 01:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
projections
 
01:02:10.710 --> 01:02:10.720 align:start position:0%
of future revenues and what our debt
 
01:02:13.670 --> 01:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
service ratio to future revenues
 
01:02:16.549 --> 01:02:16.559 align:start position:0%
will be and she will get into that and
 
01:02:19.349 --> 01:02:19.359 align:start position:0%
we will get another briefing from her
 
01:02:22.390 --> 01:02:22.400 align:start position:0%
once we get the capital budget
 
01:02:26.069 --> 01:02:26.079 align:start position:0%
and that's a sensitivity analysis
 
01:02:30.470 --> 01:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
on if we borrow 6.5 percent
 
01:02:34.549 --> 01:02:34.559 align:start position:0%
of anticipated revenue
 
01:02:38.069 --> 01:02:38.079 align:start position:0%
or 6.7 percent how much does that change
 
01:02:39.589 --> 01:02:39.599 align:start position:0%
what we can
 
01:02:42.309 --> 01:02:42.319 align:start position:0%
do as far as work and it usually ends up
 
01:02:43.510 --> 01:02:43.520 align:start position:0%
in the millions
 
01:02:45.829 --> 01:02:45.839 align:start position:0%
when you change it one a tenth of a
 
01:02:47.589 --> 01:02:47.599 align:start position:0%
percentage or whatever
 
01:02:49.670 --> 01:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
i know that representative ebel asked
 
01:02:51.750 --> 01:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
the treasurer to do
 
01:02:55.270 --> 01:02:55.280 align:start position:0%
some sensitivity analysis two years ago
 
01:02:58.230 --> 01:02:58.240 align:start position:0%
and it was amazing how much just a small
 
01:02:59.750 --> 01:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
fraction of
 
01:03:02.470 --> 01:03:02.480 align:start position:0%
change in the debt service ratio meant
 
01:03:04.789 --> 01:03:04.799 align:start position:0%
to what we could do
 
01:03:07.829 --> 01:03:07.839 align:start position:0%
as far as capital improvements were but
 
01:03:10.309 --> 01:03:10.319 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question barry
 
01:03:14.470 --> 01:03:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:17.670 --> 01:03:17.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um i have a
 
01:03:19.270 --> 01:03:19.280 align:start position:0%
question but i don't know when the
 
01:03:21.750 --> 01:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate time is to ask it
 
01:03:24.390 --> 01:03:24.400 align:start position:0%
is it correct that there were several
 
01:03:25.990 --> 01:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
projects that we
 
01:03:27.910 --> 01:03:27.920 align:start position:0%
authorized through the capital budget
 
01:03:30.230 --> 01:03:30.240 align:start position:0%
that were put on hold because of the
 
01:03:33.829 --> 01:03:33.839 align:start position:0%
pandemic and do we have any sense of
 
01:03:33.839 --> 01:03:34.230 align:start position:0%
pandemic and do we have any sense of
what

01:03:34.230 --> 01:03:34.240 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:03:36.150 --> 01:03:36.160 align:start position:0%
proportion there were or how that all
 
01:03:37.270 --> 01:03:37.280 align:start position:0%
worked out and
 
01:03:39.190 --> 01:03:39.200 align:start position:0%
again that that may not be something
 
01:03:41.109 --> 01:03:41.119 align:start position:0%
that we have an answer to right now but
 
01:03:42.630 --> 01:03:42.640 align:start position:0%
i was just curious
 
01:03:45.349 --> 01:03:45.359 align:start position:0%
um i do not have it in front of me i
 
01:03:47.589 --> 01:03:47.599 align:start position:0%
know that representative clutier and
 
01:03:49.910 --> 01:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
representative edgar and others we did
 
01:03:50.630 --> 01:03:50.640 align:start position:0%
get a
 
01:03:54.710 --> 01:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
um an update
 
01:03:56.950 --> 01:03:56.960 align:start position:0%
as part of the capital budget overview
 
01:03:59.430 --> 01:03:59.440 align:start position:0%
committee which is a statutory committee
 
01:04:02.630 --> 01:04:02.640 align:start position:0%
on which we served that overseas capital
 
01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:04.309 align:start position:0%
on which we served that overseas capital
improvement

01:04:04.309 --> 01:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
improvement
 
01:04:06.950 --> 01:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
outside of of the regis regular
 
01:04:09.190 --> 01:04:09.200 align:start position:0%
legislative process
 
01:04:11.990 --> 01:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
yes the governor did suspend all capital
 
01:04:13.829 --> 01:04:13.839 align:start position:0%
projects at the very start of the
 
01:04:13.839 --> 01:04:14.950 align:start position:0%
projects at the very start of the
pandemic

01:04:14.950 --> 01:04:14.960 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
01:04:17.990 --> 01:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
where it looked like we i have a cuckoo
 
01:04:24.549 --> 01:04:24.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:26.630 --> 01:04:26.640 align:start position:0%
and there is no way short of sloppy that
 
01:04:28.549 --> 01:04:28.559 align:start position:0%
then i can do anything with it
 
01:04:32.470 --> 01:04:32.480 align:start position:0%
uh anyways the governor did um
 
01:04:35.589 --> 01:04:35.599 align:start position:0%
pause all new capital projects with very
 
01:04:37.029 --> 01:04:37.039 align:start position:0%
few exceptions
 
01:04:40.150 --> 01:04:40.160 align:start position:0%
at the start of the pandemic he
 
01:04:43.190 --> 01:04:43.200 align:start position:0%
has been on a case-by-case basis
 
01:04:45.829 --> 01:04:45.839 align:start position:0%
allowing them to proceed with either
 
01:04:45.839 --> 01:04:46.549 align:start position:0%
allowing them to proceed with either
engineering

01:04:46.549 --> 01:04:46.559 align:start position:0%
engineering
 
01:04:49.910 --> 01:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
or actual moving on to construction
 
01:04:52.710 --> 01:04:52.720 align:start position:0%
i will make sure that we get the most
 
01:04:55.109 --> 01:04:55.119 align:start position:0%
updated list
 
01:04:58.309 --> 01:04:58.319 align:start position:0%
of that when we start because for those
 
01:05:00.069 --> 01:05:00.079 align:start position:0%
that are not done
 
01:05:02.549 --> 01:05:02.559 align:start position:0%
we will as the returning members know as
 
01:05:05.109 --> 01:05:05.119 align:start position:0%
part of the capital budget
 
01:05:07.510 --> 01:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
we have to either extend the
 
01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:09.109 align:start position:0%
we have to either extend the
appropriation

01:05:09.109 --> 01:05:09.119 align:start position:0%
appropriation
 
01:05:12.390 --> 01:05:12.400 align:start position:0%
for another two years or not and that
 
01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:13.029 align:start position:0%
for another two years or not and that
whole

01:05:13.029 --> 01:05:13.039 align:start position:0%
whole
 
01:05:17.190 --> 01:05:17.200 align:start position:0%
it's called lapses and lapse extensions
 
01:05:21.270 --> 01:05:21.280 align:start position:0%
is a whole day of of listening to
 
01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:21.990 align:start position:0%
is a whole day of of listening to
agencies

01:05:21.990 --> 01:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
01:05:24.710 --> 01:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
as it is but part of that is going to be
 
01:05:26.390 --> 01:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
because of the pause
 
01:05:29.190 --> 01:05:29.200 align:start position:0%
that was put on all of these um projects
 
01:05:31.190 --> 01:05:31.200 align:start position:0%
so there will be a larger
 
01:05:34.630 --> 01:05:34.640 align:start position:0%
amount i think this time around um
 
01:05:36.630 --> 01:05:36.640 align:start position:0%
because i don't think even if the
 
01:05:39.349 --> 01:05:39.359 align:start position:0%
contracts are let this spring
 
01:05:42.390 --> 01:05:42.400 align:start position:0%
um the money will not be fully um
 
01:05:45.750 --> 01:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
obligated um by the
 
01:05:48.549 --> 01:05:48.559 align:start position:0%
first of july so we'll have to extend it
 
01:05:50.069 --> 01:05:50.079 align:start position:0%
um but we'll get into those
 
01:05:53.270 --> 01:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
details once we actually
 
01:05:56.549 --> 01:05:56.559 align:start position:0%
see what the governor proposes
 
01:05:58.390 --> 01:05:58.400 align:start position:0%
and then get an update from
 
01:06:00.150 --> 01:06:00.160 align:start position:0%
administrative services and other
 
01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:01.430 align:start position:0%
administrative services and other
agencies

01:06:01.430 --> 01:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
01:06:04.710 --> 01:06:04.720 align:start position:0%
on what they have done or not done
 
01:06:07.190 --> 01:06:07.200 align:start position:0%
hopefully that answered your question
 
01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:08.150 align:start position:0%
hopefully that answered your question
karen

01:06:08.150 --> 01:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
karen
 
01:06:11.990 --> 01:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
thank you can i ask the question sure
 
01:06:13.589 --> 01:06:13.599 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't know if it's a question
 
01:06:15.589 --> 01:06:15.599 align:start position:0%
for the treasurer or not but i know the
 
01:06:16.950 --> 01:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
one bill
 
01:06:20.230 --> 01:06:20.240 align:start position:0%
that we had that we passed funding
 
01:06:23.390 --> 01:06:23.400 align:start position:0%
50 million dollars to loan to
 
01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:25.430 align:start position:0%
50 million dollars to loan to
municipalities

01:06:25.430 --> 01:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
01:06:28.950 --> 01:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
to remedy the pfa's
 
01:06:32.789 --> 01:06:32.799 align:start position:0%
situation whether that what the status
 
01:06:34.069 --> 01:06:34.079 align:start position:0%
of that is
 
01:06:36.789 --> 01:06:36.799 align:start position:0%
because i mean i i think it obviously
 
01:06:38.710 --> 01:06:38.720 align:start position:0%
have an impact
 
01:06:41.829 --> 01:06:41.839 align:start position:0%
it i do not know with status of that as
 
01:06:44.069 --> 01:06:44.079 align:start position:0%
far as letting the bonds out
 
01:06:46.309 --> 01:06:46.319 align:start position:0%
um and you might be willing you might be
 
01:06:47.190 --> 01:06:47.200 align:start position:0%
able to ask
 
01:06:51.190 --> 01:06:51.200 align:start position:0%
the um the treasurer when she comes on
 
01:06:54.309 --> 01:06:54.319 align:start position:0%
but yes it will have an impact because
 
01:06:57.349 --> 01:06:57.359 align:start position:0%
all bonding impacts our
 
01:07:00.789 --> 01:07:00.799 align:start position:0%
debt service ratio which then impacts on
 
01:07:02.549 --> 01:07:02.559 align:start position:0%
what we can borrow for
 
01:07:06.069 --> 01:07:06.079 align:start position:0%
the coming biennium and the future
 
01:07:09.190 --> 01:07:09.200 align:start position:0%
so that's why we don't like to to
 
01:07:12.950 --> 01:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
as i said earlier do um
 
01:07:15.510 --> 01:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
stand-alone capital appropriations
 
01:07:16.549 --> 01:07:16.559 align:start position:0%
because it does
 
01:07:19.750 --> 01:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
work um into the whole
 
01:07:21.670 --> 01:07:21.680 align:start position:0%
bonding issue which we are supposed to
 
01:07:23.270 --> 01:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
be overseeing
 
01:07:25.910 --> 01:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
um the other thing that some of the
 
01:07:27.510 --> 01:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
returning members
 
01:07:31.349 --> 01:07:31.359 align:start position:0%
may know that in one of those omnibus
 
01:07:31.359 --> 01:07:32.309 align:start position:0%
may know that in one of those omnibus
bills

01:07:32.309 --> 01:07:32.319 align:start position:0%
bills
 
01:07:34.230 --> 01:07:34.240 align:start position:0%
that was passed by the senate and the
 
01:07:37.510 --> 01:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
house there was some
 
01:07:41.190 --> 01:07:41.200 align:start position:0%
additional money for cte
 
01:07:43.250 --> 01:07:43.260 align:start position:0%
community technical
 
01:07:43.260 --> 01:07:44.710 align:start position:0%
community technical
[Music]

01:07:44.710 --> 01:07:44.720 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:07:48.549 --> 01:07:48.559 align:start position:0%
school in hudson
 
01:07:51.829 --> 01:07:51.839 align:start position:0%
but that money was found by using money
 
01:07:54.309 --> 01:07:54.319 align:start position:0%
from projects that was already completed
 
01:07:57.750 --> 01:07:57.760 align:start position:0%
so it would not impact on on
 
01:08:01.270 --> 01:08:01.280 align:start position:0%
the overall um debt servicing within the
 
01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:02.069 align:start position:0%
the overall um debt servicing within the
state

01:08:02.069 --> 01:08:02.079 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:08:07.190 --> 01:08:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:10.230 --> 01:08:10.240 align:start position:0%
okay the second major item
 
01:08:13.510 --> 01:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
on bit typical bills is in the second
 
01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:14.069 align:start position:0%
on bit typical bills is in the second
year

01:08:14.069 --> 01:08:14.079 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
of the biennium and that is
 
01:08:20.870 --> 01:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
the um 10-year transportation plan
 
01:08:23.990 --> 01:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
um it always comes in the even numbered
 
01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:25.590 align:start position:0%
um it always comes in the even numbered
years

01:08:25.590 --> 01:08:25.600 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:08:29.030 --> 01:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
and in that we deal with all facets of
 
01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:30.390 align:start position:0%
and in that we deal with all facets of
transportation

01:08:30.390 --> 01:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
01:08:33.669 --> 01:08:33.679 align:start position:0%
within the states not just roads bridges
 
01:08:33.679 --> 01:08:34.630 align:start position:0%
within the states not just roads bridges
highways

01:08:34.630 --> 01:08:34.640 align:start position:0%
highways
 
01:08:38.789 --> 01:08:38.799 align:start position:0%
it's rail aeronautics
 
01:08:41.829 --> 01:08:41.839 align:start position:0%
bus transportation all of those types of
 
01:08:41.839 --> 01:08:43.430 align:start position:0%
bus transportation all of those types of
issues

01:08:43.430 --> 01:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
issues
 
01:08:46.630 --> 01:08:46.640 align:start position:0%
and we will be getting a briefing
 
01:08:49.990 --> 01:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
at some point from the
 
01:08:53.030 --> 01:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
department of transportation on
 
01:08:56.070 --> 01:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
their function in all of this as well as
 
01:08:57.590 --> 01:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
their challenges with
 
01:09:00.789 --> 01:09:00.799 align:start position:0%
funding um
 
01:09:04.309 --> 01:09:04.319 align:start position:0%
with with this um and some of that will
 
01:09:06.789 --> 01:09:06.799 align:start position:0%
deal with what happens in washington d.c
 
01:09:10.149 --> 01:09:10.159 align:start position:0%
because a significant portion unlike
 
01:09:12.070 --> 01:09:12.080 align:start position:0%
almost all of it
 
01:09:14.550 --> 01:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
for what we do comes from the federal
 
01:09:15.829 --> 01:09:15.839 align:start position:0%
highway fund
 
01:09:19.110 --> 01:09:19.120 align:start position:0%
and so we will have to
 
01:09:21.110 --> 01:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
to get into that and we will get a
 
01:09:22.309 --> 01:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
briefing on that
 
01:09:25.510 --> 01:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
this first year
 
01:09:27.510 --> 01:09:27.520 align:start position:0%
and then again in the second year
 
01:09:29.910 --> 01:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
because everything that we do
 
01:09:31.349 --> 01:09:31.359 align:start position:0%
people are going to be asking you what's
 
01:09:33.189 --> 01:09:33.199 align:start position:0%
going on with transportation
 
01:09:36.229 --> 01:09:36.239 align:start position:0%
and highways and bridges what why the
 
01:09:38.630 --> 01:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
bridge in my town isn't fixed
 
01:09:41.669 --> 01:09:41.679 align:start position:0%
or when it will be fixed um
 
01:09:46.229 --> 01:09:46.239 align:start position:0%
those types of of things um
 
01:09:50.149 --> 01:09:50.159 align:start position:0%
and then all bills dealing with changes
 
01:09:53.749 --> 01:09:53.759 align:start position:0%
to the highway fund which by
 
01:09:57.669 --> 01:09:57.679 align:start position:0%
constitution is um
 
01:10:01.510 --> 01:10:01.520 align:start position:0%
primarily um the road toll our gas tax
 
01:10:01.990 --> 01:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
as most
 
01:10:05.350 --> 01:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
people call it and registration fees
 
01:10:08.870 --> 01:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
that the state collects goes into a
 
01:10:12.870 --> 01:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
highway fund which can only be used
 
01:10:16.990 --> 01:10:17.000 align:start position:0%
for roads and
 
01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:20.630 align:start position:0%
for roads and
associated

01:10:20.630 --> 01:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:23.750 --> 01:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
things such as staffing of dot and the
 
01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:25.669 align:start position:0%
things such as staffing of dot and the
rest

01:10:25.669 --> 01:10:25.679 align:start position:0%
rest
 
01:10:28.310 --> 01:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
and also any changes to the turnpike
 
01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:29.830 align:start position:0%
and also any changes to the turnpike
fund

01:10:29.830 --> 01:10:29.840 align:start position:0%
fund
 
01:10:32.630 --> 01:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
which is collected as as everybody knows
 
01:10:33.750 --> 01:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
at the
 
01:10:37.030 --> 01:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
toll plazas throughout the state
 
01:10:40.149 --> 01:10:40.159 align:start position:0%
all of that comes to us there is at
 
01:10:40.159 --> 01:10:40.550 align:start position:0%
all of that comes to us there is at
least

01:10:40.550 --> 01:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
least
 
01:10:43.990 --> 01:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
one bill in the house
 
01:10:46.390 --> 01:10:46.400 align:start position:0%
i do not know where it is because i it
 
01:10:48.310 --> 01:10:48.320 align:start position:0%
has not been assigned a
 
01:10:51.350 --> 01:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
a bill number yet that deals with a
 
01:10:54.709 --> 01:10:54.719 align:start position:0%
a road usage fee i do not know whether
 
01:10:55.830 --> 01:10:55.840 align:start position:0%
that will come to us
 
01:10:59.830 --> 01:10:59.840 align:start position:0%
first or go to ways and means first
 
01:11:01.990 --> 01:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
in the past it has come to us first to
 
01:11:03.590 --> 01:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
see how it fits in
 
01:11:06.630 --> 01:11:06.640 align:start position:0%
to working up the highway fund and then
 
01:11:09.270 --> 01:11:09.280 align:start position:0%
gone to ways and means
 
01:11:12.790 --> 01:11:12.800 align:start position:0%
but i do not know the chair of ways and
 
01:11:15.189 --> 01:11:15.199 align:start position:0%
means is the primary sponsor
 
01:11:18.470 --> 01:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
of that bill there is a similar bill
 
01:11:22.310 --> 01:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
um in the senate do not know where that
 
01:11:23.270 --> 01:11:23.280 align:start position:0%
will go
 
01:11:25.669 --> 01:11:25.679 align:start position:0%
but if it comes over we may be we may
 
01:11:26.870 --> 01:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
see that
 
01:11:30.070 --> 01:11:30.080 align:start position:0%
in the second half of this year um
 
01:11:32.229 --> 01:11:32.239 align:start position:0%
and we can talk about that if and when
 
01:11:34.870 --> 01:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
those bills show up in committee
 
01:11:37.669 --> 01:11:37.679 align:start position:0%
and then um we have bills that name
 
01:11:37.679 --> 01:11:38.870 align:start position:0%
and then um we have bills that name
things

01:11:38.870 --> 01:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:11:41.910 --> 01:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
um you know to to name the bridge
 
01:11:44.229 --> 01:11:44.239 align:start position:0%
in bedford the the john a graham
 
01:11:45.750 --> 01:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
memorial bridge
 
01:11:49.830 --> 01:11:49.840 align:start position:0%
um not yet guys not yet
 
01:11:53.430 --> 01:11:53.440 align:start position:0%
but those would come to us
 
01:11:55.910 --> 01:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
if it is a state bridge state road state
 
01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:56.790 align:start position:0%
if it is a state bridge state road state
highway

01:11:56.790 --> 01:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
highway
 
01:12:00.790 --> 01:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
or state building because they are state
 
01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:01.669 align:start position:0%
or state building because they are state
property

01:12:01.669 --> 01:12:01.679 align:start position:0%
property
 
01:12:05.270 --> 01:12:05.280 align:start position:0%
and we are the committee that it comes
 
01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:05.590 align:start position:0%
and we are the committee that it comes
to

01:12:05.590 --> 01:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:12:10.870 --> 01:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
for approval it's fairly simple
 
01:12:14.229 --> 01:12:14.239 align:start position:0%
but a lot of them are
 
01:12:17.510 --> 01:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
memorials to somebody who has passed and
 
01:12:18.390 --> 01:12:18.400 align:start position:0%
has had
 
01:12:20.709 --> 01:12:20.719 align:start position:0%
significant contribution to our nation
 
01:12:21.510 --> 01:12:21.520 align:start position:0%
our state
 
01:12:25.189 --> 01:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
or even their own town so
 
01:12:27.669 --> 01:12:27.679 align:start position:0%
be on the lookout for those and then
 
01:12:27.679 --> 01:12:28.310 align:start position:0%
be on the lookout for those and then
finally

01:12:28.310 --> 01:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
finally
 
01:12:31.669 --> 01:12:31.679 align:start position:0%
as i read in the charge uh monuments and
 
01:12:31.679 --> 01:12:33.669 align:start position:0%
as i read in the charge uh monuments and
memorials

01:12:33.669 --> 01:12:33.679 align:start position:0%
memorials
 
01:12:37.270 --> 01:12:37.280 align:start position:0%
um we do get those
 
01:12:39.990 --> 01:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
there are not a lot of of new ones being
 
01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:40.790 align:start position:0%
there are not a lot of of new ones being
built

01:12:40.790 --> 01:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
built
 
01:12:44.310 --> 01:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
the most recent one is the um
 
01:12:47.270 --> 01:12:47.280 align:start position:0%
the one across from the the state house
 
01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:47.750 align:start position:0%
the one across from the the state house
for

01:12:47.750 --> 01:12:47.760 align:start position:0%

01:12:50.790 --> 01:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
um uh what's the what's his name
 
01:12:54.390 --> 01:12:54.400 align:start position:0%

um that is in front of the state library
 
01:13:01.189 --> 01:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
um and so we have to to look at those
 
01:13:03.830 --> 01:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
and how they're going to be funded the
 
01:13:04.550 --> 01:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
one over
 
01:13:07.830 --> 01:13:07.840 align:start position:0%
odeon point was funded privately
 
01:13:11.510 --> 01:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
most of them are there's one in front of
 
01:13:14.870 --> 01:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
uh dot on hazen drive
 
01:13:16.709 --> 01:13:16.719 align:start position:0%
that is being raised the money freight
 
01:13:17.990 --> 01:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
is being raised
 
01:13:21.110 --> 01:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
uh privately as well so it depends but
 
01:13:22.390 --> 01:13:22.400 align:start position:0%
we will get them
 
01:13:26.070 --> 01:13:26.080 align:start position:0%
i have not seen any right now
 
01:13:30.149 --> 01:13:30.159 align:start position:0%
today without the capital budget
 
01:13:31.990 --> 01:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
there are only five bills that have been
 
01:13:33.990 --> 01:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
assigned to the committee
 
01:13:35.990 --> 01:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
two of them deal with uh capital
 
01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:37.350 align:start position:0%
two of them deal with uh capital
requests

01:13:37.350 --> 01:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
requests
 
01:13:41.270 --> 01:13:41.280 align:start position:0%
um one melissa deals with uh
 
01:13:45.910 --> 01:13:45.920 align:start position:0%
turnpike uh toll plazas in merrimack
 
01:13:51.110 --> 01:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:54.630 --> 01:13:54.640 align:start position:0%
sound wall in uh bedford
 
01:13:58.229 --> 01:13:58.239 align:start position:0%
guess who put that one in ah but
 
01:14:01.750 --> 01:14:01.760 align:start position:0%
um if those are the five and i forget
 
01:14:02.950 --> 01:14:02.960 align:start position:0%
what the other one is i
 
01:14:05.910 --> 01:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
if they're on the website you can look
 
01:14:06.950 --> 01:14:06.960 align:start position:0%
and see what they are
 
01:14:09.830 --> 01:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
and read them ahead of time but if we do
 
01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:10.470 align:start position:0%
and read them ahead of time but if we do
not

01:14:10.470 --> 01:14:10.480 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:14:14.709 --> 01:14:14.719 align:start position:0%
get any others um my intention is to
 
01:14:16.229 --> 01:14:16.239 align:start position:0%
hear all five of those
 
01:14:19.350 --> 01:14:19.360 align:start position:0%
in one day um
 
01:14:22.229 --> 01:14:22.239 align:start position:0%
and hopefully it it will be we'll get
 
01:14:23.990 --> 01:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
into hybrid meetings
 
01:14:27.270 --> 01:14:27.280 align:start position:0%
in in a bit but one long day
 
01:14:30.950 --> 01:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
the speaker has given the chairman
 
01:14:34.390 --> 01:14:34.400 align:start position:0%
the authority to do same-day
 
01:14:37.510 --> 01:14:37.520 align:start position:0%
executive sessions it will be my
 
01:14:39.189 --> 01:14:39.199 align:start position:0%
intention to do that
 
01:14:42.709 --> 01:14:42.719 align:start position:0%
if the committee can agree
 
01:14:48.470 --> 01:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
on a way to handle each bill
 
01:14:50.229 --> 01:14:50.239 align:start position:0%
so that we're not coming back in a
 
01:14:52.070 --> 01:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
second time just to have
 
01:14:55.510 --> 01:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
a half hour executive session
 
01:14:58.630 --> 01:14:58.640 align:start position:0%
it is a change from normal house
 
01:14:58.640 --> 01:14:59.830 align:start position:0%
it is a change from normal house
practice

01:14:59.830 --> 01:14:59.840 align:start position:0%
practice
 
01:15:01.990 --> 01:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
where you usually have at least a week
 
01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:02.950 align:start position:0%
where you usually have at least a week
between

01:15:02.950 --> 01:15:02.960 align:start position:0%
between
 
01:15:06.229 --> 01:15:06.239 align:start position:0%
the hearing and the rest um
 
01:15:09.350 --> 01:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
if there is controversy on any bill i
 
01:15:10.550 --> 01:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
will do that
 
01:15:13.990 --> 01:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
but i think that given the circumstances
 
01:15:15.350 --> 01:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
at the moment
 
01:15:19.189 --> 01:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
if we can either um
 
01:15:21.910 --> 01:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
at the end of of a bill or the end of a
 
01:15:23.350 --> 01:15:23.360 align:start position:0%
couple bills like
 
01:15:25.110 --> 01:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
handle both of those for capital
 
01:15:27.189 --> 01:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
requests in one exact
 
01:15:29.189 --> 01:15:29.199 align:start position:0%
executive session after hearing both of
 
01:15:30.630 --> 01:15:30.640 align:start position:0%
them um
 
01:15:33.350 --> 01:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
we do that and move on and that will
 
01:15:34.870 --> 01:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
clear the deck
 
01:15:38.149 --> 01:15:38.159 align:start position:0%
before we get the capital budget which
 
01:15:40.070 --> 01:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
so we won't have anything hanging over
 
01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:40.630 align:start position:0%
so we won't have anything hanging over
us

01:15:40.630 --> 01:15:40.640 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:15:44.950 --> 01:15:44.960 align:start position:0%
unless we get a second committee bill
 
01:15:46.790 --> 01:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
now second committee bills the returning
 
01:15:48.950 --> 01:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
members all know what that is
 
01:15:53.189 --> 01:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
it is one committee will hear the bill
 
01:15:55.990 --> 01:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
make a recommendation of the house if it
 
01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:57.750 align:start position:0%
make a recommendation of the house if it
passes

01:15:57.750 --> 01:15:57.760 align:start position:0%
passes
 
01:16:00.709 --> 01:16:00.719 align:start position:0%
if there is another policy or financial
 
01:16:00.719 --> 01:16:02.709 align:start position:0%
if there is another policy or financial
interest

01:16:02.709 --> 01:16:02.719 align:start position:0%
interest
 
01:16:04.870 --> 01:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
that has to be resolved by a different
 
01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:05.750 align:start position:0%
that has to be resolved by a different
committee

01:16:05.750 --> 01:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:16:08.630 --> 01:16:08.640 align:start position:0%
it gets sent to a second committee we
 
01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:10.070 align:start position:0%
it gets sent to a second committee we
occasionally

01:16:10.070 --> 01:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
occasionally
 
01:16:12.790 --> 01:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
um are either the first committee as i
 
01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:13.189 align:start position:0%
um are either the first committee as i
said

01:16:13.189 --> 01:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
said
 
01:16:15.990 --> 01:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
like on the anything changing or raising
 
01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:16.630 align:start position:0%
like on the anything changing or raising
the

01:16:16.630 --> 01:16:16.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:16:19.350 --> 01:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
the gas tax would go come to us and then
 
01:16:20.790 --> 01:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
go to ways and means
 
01:16:23.110 --> 01:16:23.120 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's the other way around it
 
01:16:24.550 --> 01:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
will go to
 
01:16:27.750 --> 01:16:27.760 align:start position:0%
uh transportation or
 
01:16:31.110 --> 01:16:31.120 align:start position:0%
something like that and then come to us
 
01:16:34.709 --> 01:16:34.719 align:start position:0%
but those are always on a deadline
 
01:16:37.910 --> 01:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
and so we'll have to just be cognizant
 
01:16:39.590 --> 01:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
of that and i will let you know which
 
01:16:41.990 --> 01:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
ones are
 
01:16:45.189 --> 01:16:45.199 align:start position:0%
have to be done early the rest are done
 
01:16:46.070 --> 01:16:46.080 align:start position:0%
within the
 
01:16:49.110 --> 01:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
the guidelines that we agreed to
 
01:16:51.590 --> 01:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
at our last session as far as deadlines
 
01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:52.390 align:start position:0%
at our last session as far as deadlines
for

01:16:52.390 --> 01:16:52.400 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:16:54.870 --> 01:16:54.880 align:start position:0%
working on bills and those are printed
 
01:16:59.830 --> 01:16:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:01.669 --> 01:17:01.679 align:start position:0%
calendar notices i mentioned that
 
01:17:04.310 --> 01:17:04.320 align:start position:0%
earlier all meetings
 
01:17:07.110 --> 01:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
to include like this one or any work
 
01:17:08.550 --> 01:17:08.560 align:start position:0%
sessions that we have
 
01:17:11.189 --> 01:17:11.199 align:start position:0%
on the capital budget have to be noticed
 
01:17:11.750 --> 01:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
in the
 
01:17:14.709 --> 01:17:14.719 align:start position:0%
in the calendar so look there every week
 
01:17:14.719 --> 01:17:15.110 align:start position:0%
in the calendar so look there every week
either

01:17:15.110 --> 01:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
either
 
01:17:18.229 --> 01:17:18.239 align:start position:0%
online or if you've elected to get it
 
01:17:22.550 --> 01:17:22.560 align:start position:0%
sent to you please read it
 
01:17:26.709 --> 01:17:26.719 align:start position:0%
or it's important
 
01:17:30.390 --> 01:17:30.400 align:start position:0%
that we be here um
 
01:17:33.910 --> 01:17:33.920 align:start position:0%
and we'll go into anything on on just
 
01:17:36.630 --> 01:17:36.640 align:start position:0%
the kind of work that we do anything
 
01:17:36.640 --> 01:17:37.750 align:start position:0%
the kind of work that we do anything
else

01:17:37.750 --> 01:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
else
 
01:17:40.149 --> 01:17:40.159 align:start position:0%
anything that i forgot the types of
 
01:17:40.159 --> 01:17:41.590 align:start position:0%
anything that i forgot the types of
things

01:17:41.590 --> 01:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:17:44.870 --> 01:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
yeah representative jack uh thank you
 
01:17:46.470 --> 01:17:46.480 align:start position:0%
it's probably worth mentioning on second
 
01:17:48.790 --> 01:17:48.800 align:start position:0%
committee bills uh that you're only
 
01:17:49.910 --> 01:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
supposed to
 
01:17:52.630 --> 01:17:52.640 align:start position:0%
uh examine the issue that brought it to
 
01:17:54.550 --> 01:17:54.560 align:start position:0%
the second committee and not the entire
 
01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:55.750 align:start position:0%
the second committee and not the entire
bill

01:17:55.750 --> 01:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:17:58.630 --> 01:17:58.640 align:start position:0%
that that is correct um the one
 
01:18:01.430 --> 01:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
committee that is notorious for
 
01:18:04.709 --> 01:18:04.719 align:start position:0%
um changing things once it gets to them
 
01:18:06.470 --> 01:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
changing policy
 
01:18:08.390 --> 01:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
is the finance committee they are
 
01:18:09.990 --> 01:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
supposed to look looking
 
01:18:12.709 --> 01:18:12.719 align:start position:0%
at whether or not it is fiscally
 
01:18:14.470 --> 01:18:14.480 align:start position:0%
responsible or
 
01:18:17.669 --> 01:18:17.679 align:start position:0%
uh there's a capability to do it but a
 
01:18:19.030 --> 01:18:19.040 align:start position:0%
lot of times
 
01:18:21.830 --> 01:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
depending on who the chairman is we'll
 
01:18:23.830 --> 01:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
also look at the policy and change the
 
01:18:25.590 --> 01:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
policy that came out of
 
01:18:27.830 --> 01:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
a different committee which kind of
 
01:18:30.790 --> 01:18:30.800 align:start position:0%
irritates some committee chairman
 
01:18:34.470 --> 01:18:34.480 align:start position:0%
when that happens that has not happened
 
01:18:35.270 --> 01:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
to us
 
01:18:39.030 --> 01:18:39.040 align:start position:0%
most of our bills are standalone
 
01:18:41.110 --> 01:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
to include the capital budget and the
 
01:18:43.910 --> 01:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
10-year plan they do not go to finance
 
01:18:46.390 --> 01:18:46.400 align:start position:0%
as a second committee so we are
 
01:18:48.229 --> 01:18:48.239 align:start position:0%
responsible for
 
01:18:52.830 --> 01:18:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:55.030 --> 01:18:55.040 align:start position:0%
um there
 
01:18:59.110 --> 01:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
as i said you will find when we start
 
01:19:00.470 --> 01:19:00.480 align:start position:0%
going back in
 
01:19:03.669 --> 01:19:03.679 align:start position:0%
that our com committee assistant has
 
01:19:04.550 --> 01:19:04.560 align:start position:0%
placed bills
 
01:19:10.229 --> 01:19:10.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:12.229 --> 01:19:12.239 align:start position:0%
normally i would say don't take them
 
01:19:13.830 --> 01:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
home because you're going to need them
 
01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:15.270 align:start position:0%
home because you're going to need them
again

01:19:15.270 --> 01:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:19:16.950 --> 01:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
but since we're not going to be able to
 
01:19:18.709 --> 01:19:18.719 align:start position:0%
get at your
 
01:19:21.350 --> 01:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
personal drawer you're going to have to
 
01:19:22.070 --> 01:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
take them back
 
01:19:27.030 --> 01:19:27.040 align:start position:0%
and forth um so just plan on that
 
01:19:31.189 --> 01:19:31.199 align:start position:0%
um public committees uh public hearings
 
01:19:34.630 --> 01:19:34.640 align:start position:0%
are all public there is no you know some
 
01:19:36.550 --> 01:19:36.560 align:start position:0%
people hear executive session
 
01:19:38.310 --> 01:19:38.320 align:start position:0%
that's still public and we'll talk about
 
01:19:40.390 --> 01:19:40.400 align:start position:0%
executive session in a moment
 
01:19:42.950 --> 01:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
but it is still a public meeting and the
 
01:19:45.430 --> 01:19:45.440 align:start position:0%
public is entitled to be there
 
01:19:49.350 --> 01:19:49.360 align:start position:0%
um the public hearing no quorum
 
01:19:53.990 --> 01:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
is required a quorum in our case
 
01:19:59.110 --> 01:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
is 12 members if there's only two of us
 
01:20:01.990 --> 01:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
we can still hold the public hearing not
 
01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:03.270 align:start position:0%
we can still hold the public hearing not
ideal

01:20:03.270 --> 01:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
ideal
 
01:20:05.830 --> 01:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
and we would i would appreciate and i
 
01:20:07.270 --> 01:20:07.280 align:start position:0%
think all of the members would
 
01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:08.310 align:start position:0%
think all of the members would
appreciate

01:20:08.310 --> 01:20:08.320 align:start position:0%
appreciate
 
01:20:11.189 --> 01:20:11.199 align:start position:0%
uh maximum participation because that's
 
01:20:13.430 --> 01:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
where you get the information about
 
01:20:17.189 --> 01:20:17.199 align:start position:0%
the bill from both the sponsors
 
01:20:20.709 --> 01:20:20.719 align:start position:0%
the critics the supporters and
 
01:20:23.110 --> 01:20:23.120 align:start position:0%
the agency if it has an impact on an
 
01:20:23.120 --> 01:20:23.990 align:start position:0%
the agency if it has an impact on an
agency

01:20:23.990 --> 01:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
agency
 
01:20:25.910 --> 01:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
and you need all of that to actually
 
01:20:27.510 --> 01:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
make up your mind on how you're going to
 
01:20:27.520 --> 01:20:28.470 align:start position:0%
make up your mind on how you're going to
support

01:20:28.470 --> 01:20:28.480 align:start position:0%
support
 
01:20:30.950 --> 01:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
or not support a particular bill or how
 
01:20:32.870 --> 01:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
you think it should be amended
 
01:20:35.830 --> 01:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
so please i i ask that you make an
 
01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:36.390 align:start position:0%
so please i i ask that you make an
effort

01:20:36.390 --> 01:20:36.400 align:start position:0%
effort
 
01:20:39.910 --> 01:20:39.920 align:start position:0%
to to make committees um
 
01:20:43.189 --> 01:20:43.199 align:start position:0%
and i'll just leave it at that
 
01:20:46.629 --> 01:20:46.639 align:start position:0%
um yes i think
 
01:20:51.270 --> 01:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:53.830 --> 01:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
i missed that one who you know you take
 
01:20:55.270 --> 01:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
it up and do time but
 
01:20:57.430 --> 01:20:57.440 align:start position:0%
there's some talk about combined
 
01:20:59.270 --> 01:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
committee hearings
 
01:21:01.030 --> 01:21:01.040 align:start position:0%
would that apply to first and second
 
01:21:03.270 --> 01:21:03.280 align:start position:0%
committees or or how would that work or
 
01:21:04.390 --> 01:21:04.400 align:start position:0%
is that not relevant to what we're
 
01:21:05.430 --> 01:21:05.440 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
01:21:08.310 --> 01:21:08.320 align:start position:0%
um what was that again barry there's
 
01:21:10.229 --> 01:21:10.239 align:start position:0%
some talk about having
 
01:21:14.870 --> 01:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
larger hearings committees you know
 
01:21:17.990 --> 01:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
two committees participating my
 
01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:18.950 align:start position:0%
two committees participating my
discussions

01:21:18.950 --> 01:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
discussions
 
01:21:22.149 --> 01:21:22.159 align:start position:0%
with with the speaker's office have been
 
01:21:22.159 --> 01:21:23.030 align:start position:0%
with with the speaker's office have been
that

01:21:23.030 --> 01:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:21:26.629 --> 01:21:26.639 align:start position:0%
that rule that we approved
 
01:21:28.870 --> 01:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
would allow the speaker to say for
 
01:21:28.880 --> 01:21:29.990 align:start position:0%
would allow the speaker to say for
example

01:21:29.990 --> 01:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
example
 
01:21:32.470 --> 01:21:32.480 align:start position:0%
public works and ways and means are now
 
01:21:35.110 --> 01:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
a combined committee
 
01:21:39.430 --> 01:21:39.440 align:start position:0%
with one chairman and the rest to hear
 
01:21:43.030 --> 01:21:43.040 align:start position:0%
um the road usage fee bill um
 
01:21:45.510 --> 01:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
and not have first and second committee
 
01:21:47.110 --> 01:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
i know in the past
 
01:21:50.310 --> 01:21:50.320 align:start position:0%
um speakers have said meet together and
 
01:21:51.590 --> 01:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
vote separately
 
01:21:56.629 --> 01:21:56.639 align:start position:0%
this rule would allow it to be one vote
 
01:21:59.750 --> 01:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
from and one committee report
 
01:22:04.870 --> 01:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:08.390 --> 01:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
so we're working on that
 
01:22:10.709 --> 01:22:10.719 align:start position:0%
i don't see us involved in a lot of
 
01:22:10.719 --> 01:22:11.669 align:start position:0%
i don't see us involved in a lot of
those

01:22:11.669 --> 01:22:11.679 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:22:15.110 --> 01:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
um maybe one or two and if so
 
01:22:17.590 --> 01:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
um i can imagine that we would have that
 
01:22:20.070 --> 01:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
in in representatives hall
 
01:22:23.189 --> 01:22:23.199 align:start position:0%
or via zoom one of the two um
 
01:22:26.310 --> 01:22:26.320 align:start position:0%
because you start talking 40 people or
 
01:22:27.590 --> 01:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
50 people
 
01:22:29.750 --> 01:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
in a room there's none big enough other
 
01:22:31.350 --> 01:22:31.360 align:start position:0%
than repsol
 
01:22:35.270 --> 01:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
um but that's that's where we are
 
01:22:38.870 --> 01:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
um so that i as i said a quorum is not
 
01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:39.910 align:start position:0%
um so that i as i said a quorum is not
needed

01:22:39.910 --> 01:22:39.920 align:start position:0%
needed
 
01:22:42.229 --> 01:22:42.239 align:start position:0%
but it helps if you've been there um
 
01:22:44.790 --> 01:22:44.800 align:start position:0%
when we get to the executive session
 
01:22:48.070 --> 01:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
rather than trying to catch up on uh
 
01:22:51.110 --> 01:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
what was said during the hearing
 
01:22:55.030 --> 01:22:55.040 align:start position:0%
um typically the way it works
 
01:22:58.950 --> 01:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
um and i'm probably putting with those
 
01:22:59.910 --> 01:22:59.920 align:start position:0%
of you who have been
 
01:23:02.790 --> 01:23:02.800 align:start position:0%
on various committees before to sleep
 
01:23:02.800 --> 01:23:03.510 align:start position:0%
on various committees before to sleep
but

01:23:03.510 --> 01:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:23:07.430 --> 01:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
the sponsor or sponsors of the bill
 
01:23:10.870 --> 01:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
will come in and introduce the bill to
 
01:23:13.430 --> 01:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
uh the members of the committee and then
 
01:23:14.629 --> 01:23:14.639 align:start position:0%
take questions on
 
01:23:17.669 --> 01:23:17.679 align:start position:0%
why the bill has been put in
 
01:23:21.669 --> 01:23:21.679 align:start position:0%
we hear from the sponsors first and then
 
01:23:26.149 --> 01:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:29.750 --> 01:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
members of the public both pro and con
 
01:23:33.910 --> 01:23:33.920 align:start position:0%
now if the governor or the chief justice
 
01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:34.310 align:start position:0%
now if the governor or the chief justice
uh

01:23:34.310 --> 01:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:23:36.550 --> 01:23:36.560 align:start position:0%
come in they're obviously going to go to
 
01:23:37.990 --> 01:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
the head of the line
 
01:23:41.189 --> 01:23:41.199 align:start position:0%
as a matter of respect for um
 
01:23:44.310 --> 01:23:44.320 align:start position:0%
for their heading up the um
 
01:23:48.070 --> 01:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
um other branches of of
 
01:23:50.470 --> 01:23:50.480 align:start position:0%
government or if the speaker comes in i
 
01:23:51.430 --> 01:23:51.440 align:start position:0%
will probably
 
01:23:55.990 --> 01:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
defer let him speak as well
 
01:23:58.229 --> 01:23:58.239 align:start position:0%
but i don't expect that to happen i
 
01:23:59.990 --> 01:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
expect those directions to come in
 
01:24:02.310 --> 01:24:02.320 align:start position:0%
private um
 
01:24:07.110 --> 01:24:07.120 align:start position:0%
but that works and i want to talk
 
01:24:10.310 --> 01:24:10.320 align:start position:0%
because it's important that
 
01:24:13.110 --> 01:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
you have are entitled to ask questions
 
01:24:15.750 --> 01:24:15.760 align:start position:0%
of everybody who testifies
 
01:24:18.790 --> 01:24:18.800 align:start position:0%
they do not have to answer your question
 
01:24:21.910 --> 01:24:21.920 align:start position:0%
and most of them will but
 
01:24:27.669 --> 01:24:27.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:30.310 --> 01:24:30.320 align:start position:0%
private citizens who are there to make a
 
01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:31.350 align:start position:0%
private citizens who are there to make a
point

01:24:31.350 --> 01:24:31.360 align:start position:0%
point
 
01:24:33.350 --> 01:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
they don't know the background they
 
01:24:34.790 --> 01:24:34.800 align:start position:0%
don't know the rest
 
01:24:38.629 --> 01:24:38.639 align:start position:0%
um don't engage them in a debate
 
01:24:41.830 --> 01:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
um that that's true of anybody
 
01:24:44.229 --> 01:24:44.239 align:start position:0%
we're not when you ask them the question
 
01:24:46.310 --> 01:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
it's not to engage in debate is to
 
01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:47.030 align:start position:0%
it's not to engage in debate is to
elicit

01:24:47.030 --> 01:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
elicit
 
01:24:49.910 --> 01:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
information to clarify something in your
 
01:24:49.920 --> 01:24:50.950 align:start position:0%
information to clarify something in your
mind

01:24:50.950 --> 01:24:50.960 align:start position:0%
mind
 
01:24:55.750 --> 01:24:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:57.990 --> 01:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
debate comes in our executive session
 
01:25:00.310 --> 01:25:00.320 align:start position:0%
amongst ourselves
 
01:25:01.940 --> 01:25:01.950 align:start position:0%
so please
 
01:25:01.950 --> 01:25:03.669 align:start position:0%
so please
[Music]

01:25:03.669 --> 01:25:03.679 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:25:05.590 --> 01:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
getting back to decorum and that's part
 
01:25:06.790 --> 01:25:06.800 align:start position:0%
of the decorum
 
01:25:10.830 --> 01:25:10.840 align:start position:0%
you just go you know you mentioned that
 
01:25:14.870 --> 01:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
xyz will happen if uh what if
 
01:25:16.950 --> 01:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't happen what what is
 
01:25:17.910 --> 01:25:17.920 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:25:20.790 --> 01:25:20.800 align:start position:0%
consequence that those types of things i
 
01:25:24.149 --> 01:25:24.159 align:start position:0%
would also like to see a whole lot
 
01:25:27.430 --> 01:25:27.440 align:start position:0%
fewer of um
 
01:25:30.629 --> 01:25:30.639 align:start position:0%
speeches from members that end in would
 
01:25:32.310 --> 01:25:32.320 align:start position:0%
you believe
 
01:25:35.590 --> 01:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
too many members use that as a
 
01:25:38.070 --> 01:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
mechanism to make a speech while
 
01:25:40.070 --> 01:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
somebody is testifying
 
01:25:41.910 --> 01:25:41.920 align:start position:0%
you know it's sort of like well i don't
 
01:25:43.590 --> 01:25:43.600 align:start position:0%
agree with your position
 
01:25:46.629 --> 01:25:46.639 align:start position:0%
and i think x y and z is not very good
 
01:25:48.870 --> 01:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
uh would you believe that that's not a
 
01:25:49.830 --> 01:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
question of
 
01:25:54.149 --> 01:25:54.159 align:start position:0%
the person who is um testifying so
 
01:25:56.629 --> 01:25:56.639 align:start position:0%
please it's solicit information
 
01:25:58.550 --> 01:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
and if you want to argue when we get
 
01:26:00.310 --> 01:26:00.320 align:start position:0%
into exact session
 
01:26:04.390 --> 01:26:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:09.510 --> 01:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
all questions are directed through me
 
01:26:12.550 --> 01:26:12.560 align:start position:0%
i will recognize you if you have a
 
01:26:14.870 --> 01:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
question of a particular speaker
 
01:26:18.149 --> 01:26:18.159 align:start position:0%
raise your hand um make or
 
01:26:19.830 --> 01:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
make sure that the vice chair or the
 
01:26:21.910 --> 01:26:21.920 align:start position:0%
clerk or
 
01:26:24.790 --> 01:26:24.800 align:start position:0%
the the ranking member no they'll all
 
01:26:26.390 --> 01:26:26.400 align:start position:0%
make sure that i know that you want to
 
01:26:27.830 --> 01:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
ask a question
 
01:26:31.510 --> 01:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
i'm knowing all of you and i'm sure that
 
01:26:33.350 --> 01:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
nobody's going to be shy
 
01:26:35.030 --> 01:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
about making sure that i know that you
 
01:26:37.910 --> 01:26:37.920 align:start position:0%
want to ask a question
 
01:26:41.030 --> 01:26:41.040 align:start position:0%
so that is helpful
 
01:26:43.030 --> 01:26:43.040 align:start position:0%
and if there are multiple people trying
 
01:26:46.149 --> 01:26:46.159 align:start position:0%
to ask a question of the same
 
01:26:49.270 --> 01:26:49.280 align:start position:0%
person who is who is testifying
 
01:26:52.390 --> 01:26:52.400 align:start position:0%
i will try to take them in order you get
 
01:26:54.149 --> 01:26:54.159 align:start position:0%
one question
 
01:26:56.310 --> 01:26:56.320 align:start position:0%
and then if you have a follow-up you ask
 
01:26:56.320 --> 01:26:57.189 align:start position:0%
and then if you have a follow-up you ask
me

01:26:57.189 --> 01:26:57.199 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:26:59.910 --> 01:26:59.920 align:start position:0%
um for permission to ask a follow-up you
 
01:27:01.830 --> 01:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
don't just have the floor
 
01:27:04.950 --> 01:27:04.960 align:start position:0%
once i call on you that's a house rule
 
01:27:07.990 --> 01:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
that's a long-standing house policy as
 
01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:09.030 align:start position:0%
that's a long-standing house policy as
well

01:27:09.030 --> 01:27:09.040 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:27:12.310 --> 01:27:12.320 align:start position:0%
it just keeps control of the committee
 
01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:13.270 align:start position:0%
it just keeps control of the committee
hearing

01:27:13.270 --> 01:27:13.280 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
01:27:15.510 --> 01:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
and i would ask for your cooperation in
 
01:27:15.520 --> 01:27:16.390 align:start position:0%
and i would ask for your cooperation in
that

01:27:16.390 --> 01:27:16.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:27:19.270 --> 01:27:19.280 align:start position:0%
if you start to ask a second question i
 
01:27:20.629 --> 01:27:20.639 align:start position:0%
will probably say
 
01:27:23.830 --> 01:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
something along the lines of you have a
 
01:27:25.750 --> 01:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
follow-up representative
 
01:27:28.870 --> 01:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
um just to remind people that that they
 
01:27:28.880 --> 01:27:29.189 align:start position:0%
um just to remind people that that they
do

01:27:29.189 --> 01:27:29.199 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:27:32.709 --> 01:27:32.719 align:start position:0%
have a responsibility to ask the chair
 
01:27:36.550 --> 01:27:36.560 align:start position:0%
whoever happens to be in the chair
 
01:27:40.709 --> 01:27:40.719 align:start position:0%
for for permission to ask her question
 
01:27:43.750 --> 01:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
if you ask a question that has already
 
01:27:45.510 --> 01:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
been asked and answered
 
01:27:48.310 --> 01:27:48.320 align:start position:0%
i will probably bite my tug and not be
 
01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:49.590 align:start position:0%
i will probably bite my tug and not be
sarcastic

01:27:49.590 --> 01:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
sarcastic
 
01:27:53.830 --> 01:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
but please don't do that it has happened
 
01:27:55.990 --> 01:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
not too badly in this committee but in
 
01:27:58.790 --> 01:27:58.800 align:start position:0%
others that i've sat in
 
01:28:00.790 --> 01:28:00.800 align:start position:0%
you know they've answered the question
 
01:28:02.390 --> 01:28:02.400 align:start position:0%
and then two
 
01:28:05.910 --> 01:28:05.920 align:start position:0%
um ten minutes later while they're
 
01:28:07.430 --> 01:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
answering another one a representative
 
01:28:09.430 --> 01:28:09.440 align:start position:0%
will ask the exact same question
 
01:28:13.510 --> 01:28:13.520 align:start position:0%
it's just um not very professional
 
01:28:14.870 --> 01:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
because it shows they haven't been
 
01:28:16.070 --> 01:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
paying attention
 
01:28:18.390 --> 01:28:18.400 align:start position:0%
and it also wastes time which i don't
 
01:28:20.310 --> 01:28:20.320 align:start position:0%
think any of us want to do
 
01:28:24.709 --> 01:28:24.719 align:start position:0%
i mean we get the big bucks but uh
 
01:28:30.070 --> 01:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:33.990 --> 01:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
okay anything about um
 
01:28:38.070 --> 01:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
people testifying asking questions um
 
01:28:40.550 --> 01:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
no speeches that from any or anybody
 
01:28:41.990 --> 01:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
else want to chime in
 
01:28:43.510 --> 01:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
or isn't that included or did you have
 
01:28:45.270 --> 01:28:45.280 align:start position:0%
something uh yes
 
01:28:47.350 --> 01:28:47.360 align:start position:0%
i mean the question is too i know
 
01:28:49.110 --> 01:28:49.120 align:start position:0%
because of covet 19
 
01:28:51.270 --> 01:28:51.280 align:start position:0%
are people want to come in and testify
 
01:28:53.910 --> 01:28:53.920 align:start position:0%
going to be allowed to do so remotely
 
01:28:56.550 --> 01:28:56.560 align:start position:0%
um i was going to get to that when i got
 
01:28:56.560 --> 01:28:57.430 align:start position:0%
um i was going to get to that when i got
to

01:28:57.430 --> 01:28:57.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:28:59.510 --> 01:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
i have a whole discussion on hybrid
 
01:29:01.910 --> 01:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
meetings okay short answer is
 
01:29:05.110 --> 01:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
um yes the public will testify
 
01:29:08.950 --> 01:29:08.960 align:start position:0%
via um a remote platform
 
01:29:12.950 --> 01:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:16.629 --> 01:29:16.639 align:start position:0%
that's still being worked out
 
01:29:19.750 --> 01:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
the committee will come in to
 
01:29:21.910 --> 01:29:21.920 align:start position:0%
a double room so we can be socially
 
01:29:21.920 --> 01:29:23.110 align:start position:0%
a double room so we can be socially
distanced

01:29:23.110 --> 01:29:23.120 align:start position:0%
distanced
 
01:29:26.709 --> 01:29:26.719 align:start position:0%
as much as possible members themselves
 
01:29:29.350 --> 01:29:29.360 align:start position:0%
will have the option at least initially
 
01:29:32.870 --> 01:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
to come in remotely and participate that
 
01:29:32.880 --> 01:29:33.830 align:start position:0%
to come in remotely and participate that
way

01:29:33.830 --> 01:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:29:36.390 --> 01:29:36.400 align:start position:0%
um you know especially you know like
 
01:29:37.510 --> 01:29:37.520 align:start position:0%
right today
 
01:29:38.950 --> 01:29:38.960 align:start position:0%
representative philadelphia would
 
01:29:42.149 --> 01:29:42.159 align:start position:0%
probably have not been uh welcome
 
01:29:45.270 --> 01:29:45.280 align:start position:0%
uh in the committee uh not that we
 
01:29:46.950 --> 01:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to see him but because of
 
01:29:49.030 --> 01:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
his health situation
 
01:29:50.830 --> 01:29:50.840 align:start position:0%
so people are gonna have to make those
 
01:29:50.840 --> 01:29:53.430 align:start position:0%
so people are gonna have to make those
decisions

01:29:53.430 --> 01:29:53.440 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
01:29:57.430 --> 01:29:57.440 align:start position:0%
at some point either later in the
 
01:30:01.110 --> 01:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
this calendar year or next year
 
01:30:03.830 --> 01:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
once things are under control with
 
01:30:05.270 --> 01:30:05.280 align:start position:0%
vaccine and everything
 
01:30:07.910 --> 01:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
we will go back to our traditional way
 
01:30:07.920 --> 01:30:08.709 align:start position:0%
we will go back to our traditional way
of

01:30:08.709 --> 01:30:08.719 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:30:11.669 --> 01:30:11.679 align:start position:0%
holding in-person testimony in-person
 
01:30:11.679 --> 01:30:12.470 align:start position:0%
holding in-person testimony in-person
hearings

01:30:12.470 --> 01:30:12.480 align:start position:0%
hearings
 
01:30:15.750 --> 01:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
for right now the health and safety of
 
01:30:17.350 --> 01:30:17.360 align:start position:0%
not just the members
 
01:30:20.470 --> 01:30:20.480 align:start position:0%
and staff that at the house but also
 
01:30:21.990 --> 01:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
of the general public who want to
 
01:30:23.990 --> 01:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
testify as
 
01:30:26.870 --> 01:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
all of us know who have been there if
 
01:30:26.880 --> 01:30:27.110 align:start position:0%
all of us know who have been there if
all

01:30:27.110 --> 01:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:30:29.669 --> 01:30:29.679 align:start position:0%
20 house committees are meeting there
 
01:30:31.669 --> 01:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
are several hundred people roaming the
 
01:30:31.679 --> 01:30:32.709 align:start position:0%
are several hundred people roaming the
halls

01:30:32.709 --> 01:30:32.719 align:start position:0%
halls
 
01:30:36.629 --> 01:30:36.639 align:start position:0%
at any given time so that it's just not
 
01:30:38.390 --> 01:30:38.400 align:start position:0%
conducive to
 
01:30:41.750 --> 01:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
the general health situation um
 
01:30:44.550 --> 01:30:44.560 align:start position:0%
at the moment but we'll talk a little
 
01:30:45.910 --> 01:30:45.920 align:start position:0%
bit more about that
 
01:30:48.310 --> 01:30:48.320 align:start position:0%
representative jack uh thank you mr
 
01:30:49.030 --> 01:30:49.040 align:start position:0%
chairman uh
 
01:30:51.990 --> 01:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
if same-day execs are going to be more
 
01:30:54.070 --> 01:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
in the nature of regular order
 
01:30:55.590 --> 01:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to be a lot more
 
01:30:57.910 --> 01:30:57.920 align:start position:0%
sensitive to needing quorum
 
01:30:59.669 --> 01:30:59.679 align:start position:0%
even for public hearings because there
 
01:31:01.270 --> 01:31:01.280 align:start position:0%
might be an exec and you wouldn't want
 
01:31:02.070 --> 01:31:02.080 align:start position:0%
to miss a vote
 
01:31:04.870 --> 01:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
just because you weren't there thank you
 
01:31:06.709 --> 01:31:06.719 align:start position:0%
that was next time when i was going to
 
01:31:08.470 --> 01:31:08.480 align:start position:0%
get to exact session
 
01:31:11.750 --> 01:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
because in the calendar every calendar
 
01:31:14.149 --> 01:31:14.159 align:start position:0%
for every committee will have a
 
01:31:15.189 --> 01:31:15.199 align:start position:0%
statement that
 
01:31:18.229 --> 01:31:18.239 align:start position:0%
says executive session may
 
01:31:21.030 --> 01:31:21.040 align:start position:0%
follow at any time during the day or
 
01:31:22.870 --> 01:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
words of that effect
 
01:31:26.470 --> 01:31:26.480 align:start position:0%
so if you are not there you don't get to
 
01:31:27.669 --> 01:31:27.679 align:start position:0%
vote later
 
01:31:29.910 --> 01:31:29.920 align:start position:0%
it's when the question is put by the
 
01:31:29.920 --> 01:31:30.790 align:start position:0%
it's when the question is put by the
chair

01:31:30.790 --> 01:31:30.800 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:31:36.070 --> 01:31:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:39.189 --> 01:31:39.199 align:start position:0%
which then um
 
01:31:41.990 --> 01:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
will talk about exec sessions and the
 
01:31:42.950 --> 01:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
rest and
 
01:31:45.430 --> 01:31:45.440 align:start position:0%
absences in a little bit but i thank you
 
01:31:47.510 --> 01:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
for bringing that up marty because it is
 
01:31:47.520 --> 01:31:48.550 align:start position:0%
for bringing that up marty because it is
important

01:31:48.550 --> 01:31:48.560 align:start position:0%
important
 
01:31:51.430 --> 01:31:51.440 align:start position:0%
i mean i can imagine that that first
 
01:31:52.950 --> 01:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
meeting we have
 
01:31:55.750 --> 01:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
which will not be until after the 25th
 
01:31:56.870 --> 01:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
of january
 
01:31:58.709 --> 01:31:58.719 align:start position:0%
that's a given that i heard that from
 
01:32:00.310 --> 01:32:00.320 align:start position:0%
the speaker yesterday
 
01:32:03.189 --> 01:32:03.199 align:start position:0%
because they are still trying to make
 
01:32:04.790 --> 01:32:04.800 align:start position:0%
sure that they have the uv
 
01:32:06.870 --> 01:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
lights and air exchangers and everything
 
01:32:10.709 --> 01:32:10.719 align:start position:0%
working within the community rooms
 
01:32:13.990 --> 01:32:14.000 align:start position:0%
so but that will be five bills
 
01:32:15.910 --> 01:32:15.920 align:start position:0%
you know it'll probably be another long
 
01:32:17.270 --> 01:32:17.280 align:start position:0%
day um
 
01:32:19.189 --> 01:32:19.199 align:start position:0%
with the exact sessions that i would
 
01:32:21.910 --> 01:32:21.920 align:start position:0%
like to do on the same day
 
01:32:25.270 --> 01:32:25.280 align:start position:0%
um normally just for
 
01:32:28.310 --> 01:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
for the new members um there's no
 
01:32:30.070 --> 01:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
action on the bill on the same day that
 
01:32:31.990 --> 01:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
it's heard um
 
01:32:36.229 --> 01:32:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:38.870 --> 01:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
any member to do some additional
 
01:32:38.880 --> 01:32:40.229 align:start position:0%
any member to do some additional
research

01:32:40.229 --> 01:32:40.239 align:start position:0%
research
 
01:32:43.990 --> 01:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
or the rest it's usually a week or two
 
01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:45.669 align:start position:0%
or the rest it's usually a week or two
following

01:32:45.669 --> 01:32:45.679 align:start position:0%
following
 
01:32:48.870 --> 01:32:48.880 align:start position:0%
and noticed in the calendar
 
01:32:52.390 --> 01:32:52.400 align:start position:0%
so please
 
01:32:55.910 --> 01:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
this will be different um one other
 
01:32:55.920 --> 01:32:56.550 align:start position:0%
this will be different um one other
thing

01:32:56.550 --> 01:32:56.560 align:start position:0%
thing
 
01:32:59.830 --> 01:32:59.840 align:start position:0%
about conflicts of interest
 
01:33:03.110 --> 01:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
you all
 
01:33:06.790 --> 01:33:06.800 align:start position:0%
probably know that in house sessions
 
01:33:08.790 --> 01:33:08.800 align:start position:0%
if you have a conflict of interest you
 
01:33:10.390 --> 01:33:10.400 align:start position:0%
have to declare it
 
01:33:13.590 --> 01:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
and before we vote on a bill it
 
01:33:18.070 --> 01:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
should be the same in committees
 
01:33:20.709 --> 01:33:20.719 align:start position:0%
i noticed that one member talked about
 
01:33:22.070 --> 01:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
doing construction for
 
01:33:24.470 --> 01:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
agencies that money comes through the
 
01:33:26.229 --> 01:33:26.239 align:start position:0%
capital budget
 
01:33:28.629 --> 01:33:28.639 align:start position:0%
um so you're going to have to make a
 
01:33:30.709 --> 01:33:30.719 align:start position:0%
determination on whether or not that is
 
01:33:30.719 --> 01:33:31.270 align:start position:0%
determination on whether or not that is
a

01:33:31.270 --> 01:33:31.280 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:33:34.709 --> 01:33:34.719 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest and file something
 
01:33:34.719 --> 01:33:36.390 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest and file something
with

01:33:36.390 --> 01:33:36.400 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:33:39.830 --> 01:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
the clerk's office that you will or will
 
01:33:42.229 --> 01:33:42.239 align:start position:0%
not participate on the final votes
 
01:33:45.270 --> 01:33:45.280 align:start position:0%
in committee on the capital budget
 
01:33:48.470 --> 01:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
if in fact you do do that kind of work
 
01:33:50.629 --> 01:33:50.639 align:start position:0%
for whatever agency and that's true of
 
01:33:53.030 --> 01:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
any other bill that may come before us
 
01:33:54.470 --> 01:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
or come before you and
 
01:33:57.750 --> 01:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
on the hill i just bring that up because
 
01:33:58.709 --> 01:33:58.719 align:start position:0%
i heard it
 
01:34:02.310 --> 01:34:02.320 align:start position:0%
as we were talking earlier mr speaker
 
01:34:06.070 --> 01:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
yeah chairman in anticipation of my
 
01:34:06.080 --> 01:34:07.189 align:start position:0%
yeah chairman in anticipation of my
election

01:34:07.189 --> 01:34:07.199 align:start position:0%
election
 
01:34:09.350 --> 01:34:09.360 align:start position:0%
i've not entered into any con new
 
01:34:10.790 --> 01:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
contracts with the state
 
01:34:13.350 --> 01:34:13.360 align:start position:0%
okay i i just bring it up because it's a
 
01:34:14.709 --> 01:34:14.719 align:start position:0%
good way to get
 
01:34:17.990 --> 01:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
people to to throw mud at you
 
01:34:21.110 --> 01:34:21.120 align:start position:0%
that you're voting to enrich yourself i
 
01:34:23.270 --> 01:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
understand that i'm i'm trying to work
 
01:34:23.990 --> 01:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
my way
 
01:34:27.189 --> 01:34:27.199 align:start position:0%
out of the construction business as my
 
01:34:30.790 --> 01:34:30.800 align:start position:0%
years build up here but uh i i
 
01:34:32.790 --> 01:34:32.800 align:start position:0%
was well aware that before right all
 
01:34:34.870 --> 01:34:34.880 align:start position:0%
right i i appreciate it but
 
01:34:38.310 --> 01:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
i felt it was incumbent upon me to to
 
01:34:41.990 --> 01:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
to point that out because it's important
 
01:34:45.270 --> 01:34:45.280 align:start position:0%
all right that was let's talk about
 
01:34:48.229 --> 01:34:48.239 align:start position:0%
hybrid meetings for a moment
 
01:34:51.590 --> 01:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
um hybrid meetings
 
01:34:55.270 --> 01:34:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:58.310 --> 01:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
guidance at the moment his intention
 
01:35:01.189 --> 01:35:01.199 align:start position:0%
is to have committee members come into
 
01:35:01.199 --> 01:35:02.470 align:start position:0%
is to have committee members come into
concord

01:35:02.470 --> 01:35:02.480 align:start position:0%
concord
 
01:35:06.629 --> 01:35:06.639 align:start position:0%
into a double room probably just one day
 
01:35:08.229 --> 01:35:08.239 align:start position:0%
a week for each committee
 
01:35:11.510 --> 01:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
because there's not enough technology to
 
01:35:15.830 --> 01:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
run all 20 committees at once
 
01:35:18.870 --> 01:35:18.880 align:start position:0%
we can probably do four or five
 
01:35:21.669 --> 01:35:21.679 align:start position:0%
a day any given day four or five
 
01:35:21.679 --> 01:35:22.790 align:start position:0%
a day any given day four or five
committees

01:35:22.790 --> 01:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
committees
 
01:35:25.189 --> 01:35:25.199 align:start position:0%
committees will be meeting monday
 
01:35:27.030 --> 01:35:27.040 align:start position:0%
through friday
 
01:35:29.910 --> 01:35:29.920 align:start position:0%
i do not know what day we will be
 
01:35:29.920 --> 01:35:30.550 align:start position:0%
i do not know what day we will be
meeting

01:35:30.550 --> 01:35:30.560 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
01:35:33.830 --> 01:35:33.840 align:start position:0%
at this point um i'm fighting for
 
01:35:37.109 --> 01:35:37.119 align:start position:0%
midweek and i've also told the speaker
 
01:35:39.510 --> 01:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
that once we start on the capital budget
 
01:35:42.390 --> 01:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
we're going to need more than one day to
 
01:35:42.400 --> 01:35:42.709 align:start position:0%
we're going to need more than one day to
meet

01:35:42.709 --> 01:35:42.719 align:start position:0%
meet
 
01:35:45.910 --> 01:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
because it it just has to be
 
01:35:48.070 --> 01:35:48.080 align:start position:0%
done with every agency on what they are
 
01:35:48.080 --> 01:35:49.430 align:start position:0%
done with every agency on what they are
doing

01:35:49.430 --> 01:35:49.440 align:start position:0%
doing
 
01:35:52.950 --> 01:35:52.960 align:start position:0%
so the committee will meet in person
 
01:35:56.390 --> 01:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
those committee members who feel
 
01:36:01.350 --> 01:36:01.360 align:start position:0%
unsafe and do not wish to come into the
 
01:36:04.790 --> 01:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
to the room can
 
01:36:09.430 --> 01:36:09.440 align:start position:0%
come in via remote access
 
01:36:12.870 --> 01:36:12.880 align:start position:0%
but um i will leave that up to you to
 
01:36:15.030 --> 01:36:15.040 align:start position:0%
decide which
 
01:36:18.629 --> 01:36:18.639 align:start position:0%
um the public will be given
 
01:36:21.830 --> 01:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
notice in the house calendar
 
01:36:25.510 --> 01:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
um on how to either call in
 
01:36:29.350 --> 01:36:29.360 align:start position:0%
or join via zoom um
 
01:36:33.030 --> 01:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
to give their testimony and
 
01:36:37.430 --> 01:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
um and present information
 
01:36:41.350 --> 01:36:41.360 align:start position:0%
the harder part for us and the public
 
01:36:44.550 --> 01:36:44.560 align:start position:0%
especially if it's just private citizens
 
01:36:46.410 --> 01:36:46.420 align:start position:0%
is getting their
 
01:36:46.420 --> 01:36:48.229 align:start position:0%
is getting their
[Music]

01:36:48.229 --> 01:36:48.239 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:36:51.430 --> 01:36:51.440 align:start position:0%
any written information that they have
 
01:36:53.990 --> 01:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
out to the committee members how do i
 
01:36:54.550 --> 01:36:54.560 align:start position:0%
how do
 
01:36:58.229 --> 01:36:58.239 align:start position:0%
i and we get that in and how does it get
 
01:36:58.239 --> 01:36:59.590 align:start position:0%
i and we get that in and how does it get
distributed

01:36:59.590 --> 01:36:59.600 align:start position:0%
distributed
 
01:37:01.590 --> 01:37:01.600 align:start position:0%
to committee members if we're in person
 
01:37:02.629 --> 01:37:02.639 align:start position:0%
that's easier
 
01:37:05.109 --> 01:37:05.119 align:start position:0%
we just get it xerox and put it on on
 
01:37:06.149 --> 01:37:06.159 align:start position:0%
your desk
 
01:37:08.149 --> 01:37:08.159 align:start position:0%
but if you're coming in remote it's
 
01:37:09.350 --> 01:37:09.360 align:start position:0%
going to have to be
 
01:37:13.990 --> 01:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
um emailed to you or some other fashion
 
01:37:16.790 --> 01:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
made available all of those questions
 
01:37:17.590 --> 01:37:17.600 align:start position:0%
are still
 
01:37:21.109 --> 01:37:21.119 align:start position:0%
still being worked on um and i know
 
01:37:22.790 --> 01:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
representative evil could tell me she
 
01:37:25.750 --> 01:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
probably knew how to do it but
 
01:37:28.709 --> 01:37:28.719 align:start position:0%
because we've talked about this before
 
01:37:28.719 --> 01:37:29.189 align:start position:0%
because we've talked about this before
but

01:37:29.189 --> 01:37:29.199 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:37:33.030 --> 01:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
it is going to be a challenge um
 
01:37:36.070 --> 01:37:36.080 align:start position:0%
and because
 
01:37:40.310 --> 01:37:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:42.629 --> 01:37:42.639 align:start position:0%
coming in remote we'll have to take a
 
01:37:45.109 --> 01:37:45.119 align:start position:0%
roll call
 
01:37:48.470 --> 01:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
of those coming in remote via voice at
 
01:37:49.830 --> 01:37:49.840 align:start position:0%
the start of each
 
01:37:49.840 --> 01:37:52.950 align:start position:0%
the start of each
um

01:37:52.950 --> 01:37:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:55.430 --> 01:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
session uh session day that we're there
 
01:37:57.030 --> 01:37:57.040 align:start position:0%
committee day
 
01:37:59.990 --> 01:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
just so that it's annotated on the
 
01:38:01.750 --> 01:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
committee records of who was
 
01:38:04.870 --> 01:38:04.880 align:start position:0%
in committee that day normally we just
 
01:38:06.229 --> 01:38:06.239 align:start position:0%
sign a sheet
 
01:38:07.990 --> 01:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
that gets passed around and everybody
 
01:38:10.229 --> 01:38:10.239 align:start position:0%
signs it and that's your attendance for
 
01:38:12.310 --> 01:38:12.320 align:start position:0%
the day
 
01:38:13.910 --> 01:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
but if you're coming in remote we'll
 
01:38:17.109 --> 01:38:17.119 align:start position:0%
have to make a special note of that
 
01:38:20.629 --> 01:38:20.639 align:start position:0%
doing it by zoom as i said
 
01:38:23.750 --> 01:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
will pose some problems i have asked the
 
01:38:25.270 --> 01:38:25.280 align:start position:0%
speaker as i said
 
01:38:28.070 --> 01:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
on the capital budget to allow the
 
01:38:28.080 --> 01:38:29.430 align:start position:0%
on the capital budget to allow the
agency

01:38:29.430 --> 01:38:29.440 align:start position:0%
agency
 
01:38:33.270 --> 01:38:33.280 align:start position:0%
heads or their designated representative
 
01:38:35.590 --> 01:38:35.600 align:start position:0%
to come in and testify in person to the
 
01:38:35.600 --> 01:38:37.430 align:start position:0%
to come in and testify in person to the
committee

01:38:37.430 --> 01:38:37.440 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:38:39.189 --> 01:38:39.199 align:start position:0%
only because they always bring reams of
 
01:38:41.510 --> 01:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
paper and
 
01:38:44.149 --> 01:38:44.159 align:start position:0%
i don't want to print it out at home
 
01:38:44.159 --> 01:38:46.709 align:start position:0%
i don't want to print it out at home
personally

01:38:46.709 --> 01:38:46.719 align:start position:0%
personally
 
01:38:50.229 --> 01:38:50.239 align:start position:0%
but it is also useful
 
01:38:52.790 --> 01:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
to sit there and see body language and
 
01:38:54.629 --> 01:38:54.639 align:start position:0%
and the rest
 
01:38:56.950 --> 01:38:56.960 align:start position:0%
he has not the speaker has not given me
 
01:38:57.990 --> 01:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
the okay for that
 
01:39:01.910 --> 01:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
yet but we're still six weeks out from
 
01:39:01.920 --> 01:39:02.470 align:start position:0%
yet but we're still six weeks out from
being

01:39:02.470 --> 01:39:02.480 align:start position:0%
being
 
01:39:05.350 --> 01:39:05.360 align:start position:0%
being able to start on the capital
 
01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:07.109 align:start position:0%
being able to start on the capital
budget

01:39:07.109 --> 01:39:07.119 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:39:10.870 --> 01:39:10.880 align:start position:0%
um for
 
01:39:14.470 --> 01:39:14.480 align:start position:0%
the hybrid um i will be designated as a
 
01:39:14.480 --> 01:39:15.669 align:start position:0%
the hybrid um i will be designated as a
co-host

01:39:15.669 --> 01:39:15.679 align:start position:0%
co-host
 
01:39:18.950 --> 01:39:18.960 align:start position:0%
as will um one or two other members

and we don't really look at party
 
01:39:39.750 --> 01:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
plus he was the clerk for hillsborough

01:39:45.510 --> 01:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
remotely fairly successfully i will have
 
01:39:46.629 --> 01:39:46.639 align:start position:0%

01:39:56.709 --> 01:39:56.719 align:start position:0%
some limited tech support um
 
01:39:59.669 --> 01:39:59.679 align:start position:0%
but not a lot um because we're not
 
01:40:01.510 --> 01:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
hiring a lot of new people to handle
 
01:40:01.520 --> 01:40:02.149 align:start position:0%

um in the background as
 
01:43:15.750 --> 01:43:15.760 align:start position:0%

all that
 
01:43:55.669 --> 01:43:55.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:59.510 --> 01:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:03.109 --> 01:44:03.119 align:start position:0%
anything about the remote hearings
 
01:44:07.189 --> 01:44:07.199 align:start position:0%
representative evil
 
01:44:10.870 --> 01:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much mr chair um
 
01:44:14.390 --> 01:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
so when we're talking about the hybrid
 
01:44:16.550 --> 01:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
meetings i understand that there are
 
01:44:17.830 --> 01:44:17.840 align:start position:0%
real ventilation
 
01:44:20.870 --> 01:44:20.880 align:start position:0%
problems with the lob and
 
01:44:23.030 --> 01:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
in the short term there are going to be
 
01:44:23.040 --> 01:44:23.910 align:start position:0%
in the short term there are going to be
portable

01:44:23.910 --> 01:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
portable
 
01:44:26.310 --> 01:44:26.320 align:start position:0%
ventilation machines that will be put in
 
01:44:27.030 --> 01:44:27.040 align:start position:0%
the rooms
 
01:44:29.270 --> 01:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
they're going to be double rooms and i
 
01:44:31.590 --> 01:44:31.600 align:start position:0%
guess all i would say is that i hope
 
01:44:34.950 --> 01:44:34.960 align:start position:0%
that you'll be able to provide as much
 
01:44:37.990 --> 01:44:38.000 align:start position:0%
information as possible
 
01:44:40.870 --> 01:44:40.880 align:start position:0%
you know scientific backup or whatever
 
01:44:41.430 --> 01:44:41.440 align:start position:0%
to make
 
01:44:43.590 --> 01:44:43.600 align:start position:0%
members who are deciding whether to join
 
01:44:44.470 --> 01:44:44.480 align:start position:0%
in a high
 
01:44:47.669 --> 01:44:47.679 align:start position:0%
in person or remotely
 
01:44:50.709 --> 01:44:50.719 align:start position:0%
comfortable in their decision
 
01:44:53.350 --> 01:44:53.360 align:start position:0%
i will pass on any information that i
 
01:44:53.360 --> 01:44:54.470 align:start position:0%
i will pass on any information that i
have

01:44:54.470 --> 01:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:44:56.629 --> 01:44:56.639 align:start position:0%
scientific information from a history
 
01:44:57.910 --> 01:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
major i would look at
 
01:45:02.149 --> 01:45:02.159 align:start position:0%
as suspect but what i have i
 
01:45:05.510 --> 01:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
i will make sure that the committee has
 
01:45:08.629 --> 01:45:08.639 align:start position:0%
um and and again it's going to be up to
 
01:45:10.629 --> 01:45:10.639 align:start position:0%
each individual member
 
01:45:13.750 --> 01:45:13.760 align:start position:0%
um to decide whether or not
 
01:45:16.550 --> 01:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
to attend that way at least in the short
 
01:45:16.560 --> 01:45:18.390 align:start position:0%
to attend that way at least in the short
term

01:45:18.390 --> 01:45:18.400 align:start position:0%
term
 
01:45:21.590 --> 01:45:21.600 align:start position:0%
until i
 
01:45:24.310 --> 01:45:24.320 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't even hazard a guess as to
 
01:45:24.320 --> 01:45:25.030 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't even hazard a guess as to
when

01:45:25.030 --> 01:45:25.040 align:start position:0%
when
 
01:45:27.350 --> 01:45:27.360 align:start position:0%

01:45:29.030 --> 01:45:29.040 align:start position:0%

01:46:12.310 --> 01:46:12.320 align:start position:0%
idea mr chair
 
01:46:14.310 --> 01:46:14.320 align:start position:0%
chairman when you'd schedule this
 
01:46:16.709 --> 01:46:16.719 align:start position:0%
hearing uh would it be not until at
 
01:46:17.270 --> 01:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
least the
 
01:46:19.510 --> 01:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
last week in january even into february
 
01:46:21.270 --> 01:46:21.280 align:start position:0%
right now the speaker has
 
01:46:23.990 --> 01:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
asked all of the chairman not to
 
01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:24.629 align:start position:0%
asked all of the chairman not to
schedule

01:46:24.629 --> 01:46:24.639 align:start position:0%
schedule
 
01:46:28.870 --> 01:46:28.880 align:start position:0%
any hearings next week okay
 
01:46:32.390 --> 01:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
so the week of the 25th at the earliest
 
01:46:34.629 --> 01:46:34.639 align:start position:0%
and i would like to do that either that
 
01:46:37.270 --> 01:46:37.280 align:start position:0%
week or the first week in february
 
01:46:39.590 --> 01:46:39.600 align:start position:0%
um depending on what we can work out
 
01:46:40.250 --> 01:46:40.260 align:start position:0%
with um
 
01:46:40.260 --> 01:46:41.669 align:start position:0%
with um
[Music]

01:46:41.669 --> 01:46:41.679 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:46:44.310 --> 01:46:44.320 align:start position:0%
what day and the and the rest to handle
 
01:46:45.109 --> 01:46:45.119 align:start position:0%
the five
 
01:46:47.830 --> 01:46:47.840 align:start position:0%
bills that we have in committee at the
 
01:46:47.840 --> 01:46:48.550 align:start position:0%
bills that we have in committee at the
moment

01:46:48.550 --> 01:46:48.560 align:start position:0%
moment
 
01:46:51.669 --> 01:46:51.679 align:start position:0%
if any more come in maybe both weeks i
 
01:46:52.790 --> 01:46:52.800 align:start position:0%
don't want to do
 
01:46:55.669 --> 01:46:55.679 align:start position:0%
you know seven or eight hours um if
 
01:46:55.679 --> 01:46:56.070 align:start position:0%
you know seven or eight hours um if
people

01:46:56.070 --> 01:46:56.080 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:47:00.070 --> 01:47:00.080 align:start position:0%
are there but if if it's only five or
 
01:47:00.080 --> 01:47:01.990 align:start position:0%
are there but if if it's only five or
six

01:47:01.990 --> 01:47:02.000 align:start position:0%
six
 
01:47:04.229 --> 01:47:04.239 align:start position:0%
i think that we can handle them all in
 
01:47:05.669 --> 01:47:05.679 align:start position:0%
one day
 
01:47:09.510 --> 01:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
one longish day but it's better than
 
01:47:15.350 --> 01:47:15.360 align:start position:0%
coming in two or three times in a week
 
01:47:18.629 --> 01:47:18.639 align:start position:0%
it's just we shall see not all of the
 
01:47:20.950 --> 01:47:20.960 align:start position:0%
bills have been given bill numbers or
 
01:47:23.109 --> 01:47:23.119 align:start position:0%
assigned to committees
 
01:47:28.390 --> 01:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:32.550 --> 01:47:32.560 align:start position:0%
the clerk's office this week
 
01:47:36.470 --> 01:47:36.480 align:start position:0%
we shall see but you
 
01:47:39.109 --> 01:47:39.119 align:start position:0%

01:47:40.629 --> 01:47:40.639 align:start position:0%
week of the 18th
 
01:47:44.629 --> 01:47:44.639 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chair i have a question um
 
01:48:20.310 --> 01:48:20.320 align:start position:0%
will committee members be allowed to
 
01:48:21.430 --> 01:48:21.440 align:start position:0%
vote remotely
 
01:48:25.510 --> 01:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
using zoom yes thank you
 
01:48:27.109 --> 01:48:27.119 align:start position:0%
um that's the whole purpose of the
 
01:48:29.030 --> 01:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
hybrid um
 
01:48:32.470 --> 01:48:32.480 align:start position:0%
so that will
 
01:48:35.189 --> 01:48:35.199 align:start position:0%
be that way and it won't change much i
 
01:48:35.910 --> 01:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
know that
 
01:48:39.109 --> 01:48:39.119 align:start position:0%
um on some of the committees that
 
01:48:41.990 --> 01:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
statutory committees that that i was on
 
01:48:43.990 --> 01:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
that representative clutier was on where
 
01:48:45.350 --> 01:48:45.360 align:start position:0%
normally we would
 
01:48:47.990 --> 01:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
always chair normally we'd do the voice
 
01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:48.629 align:start position:0%
always chair normally we'd do the voice
vote

01:48:48.629 --> 01:48:48.639 align:start position:0%
vote
 
01:48:51.910 --> 01:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
we had to do everything roll call but in
 
01:48:51.920 --> 01:48:53.109 align:start position:0%
we had to do everything roll call but in
committees

01:48:53.109 --> 01:48:53.119 align:start position:0%
committees
 
01:48:55.109 --> 01:48:55.119 align:start position:0%
and exec sessions we do a roll call
 
01:48:57.109 --> 01:48:57.119 align:start position:0%
anyways so
 
01:48:59.189 --> 01:48:59.199 align:start position:0%
it's just you're gonna have to to be
 
01:49:00.870 --> 01:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
there and say yay or nay
 
01:49:03.109 --> 01:49:03.119 align:start position:0%
representative newman you had a question
 
01:49:04.629 --> 01:49:04.639 align:start position:0%
or comment yes
 
01:49:07.990 --> 01:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you mr chairman if any of us
 
01:49:09.590 --> 01:49:09.600 align:start position:0%
know that we have a
 
01:49:12.950 --> 01:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
scheduling conflict say the week of the
 
01:49:15.109 --> 01:49:15.119 align:start position:0%
25th and thereafter for a
 
01:49:18.470 --> 01:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
an appointment of some sort should we
 
01:49:19.270 --> 01:49:19.280 align:start position:0%
let you know
 
01:49:21.189 --> 01:49:21.199 align:start position:0%
so maybe that will help you make a plan
 
01:49:22.390 --> 01:49:22.400 align:start position:0%
or do you have to make a plan
 
01:49:25.589 --> 01:49:25.599 align:start position:0%
irrespective of anything we've got going
 
01:49:28.629 --> 01:49:28.639 align:start position:0%
um i hate to say it this way
 
01:49:31.990 --> 01:49:32.000 align:start position:0%
but given the limited access that each
 
01:49:33.350 --> 01:49:33.360 align:start position:0%
committee will have
 
01:49:36.629 --> 01:49:36.639 align:start position:0%
to um committing rooms
 
01:49:39.510 --> 01:49:39.520 align:start position:0%
um and may only be public works you have
 
01:49:39.520 --> 01:49:40.629 align:start position:0%
um and may only be public works you have
thursdays

01:49:40.629 --> 01:49:40.639 align:start position:0%
thursdays
 
01:49:44.390 --> 01:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
in in a room um okay we're gonna have to
 
01:49:45.589 --> 01:49:45.599 align:start position:0%
go with that
 
01:49:48.629 --> 01:49:48.639 align:start position:0%
um so you know
 
01:49:51.990 --> 01:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
if you're gonna be gone for a whole week
 
01:49:55.589 --> 01:49:55.599 align:start position:0%
i i i not gonna be able i don't think to
 
01:49:59.910 --> 01:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
to work it to for individual members
 
01:50:03.750 --> 01:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
um but we can
 
01:50:07.189 --> 01:50:07.199 align:start position:0%
see what we can work on okay
 
01:50:10.550 --> 01:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
and i'll just continue like i'm i'm sure
 
01:50:12.550 --> 01:50:12.560 align:start position:0%
i'm not the only one but
 
01:50:14.629 --> 01:50:14.639 align:start position:0%
i've got a dental appointment coming up
 
01:50:16.470 --> 01:50:16.480 align:start position:0%
and i and i'm sure it's scheduled in the
 
01:50:16.480 --> 01:50:16.950 align:start position:0%
and i and i'm sure it's scheduled in the
morning

01:50:16.950 --> 01:50:16.960 align:start position:0%
morning
 
01:50:19.589 --> 01:50:19.599 align:start position:0%
some it's coming up in february and
 
01:50:20.950 --> 01:50:20.960 align:start position:0%
something else so
 
01:50:25.030 --> 01:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
if and and frankly given everything
 
01:50:26.629 --> 01:50:26.639 align:start position:0%
i mean if if you've got a dental
 
01:50:29.750 --> 01:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
appointment or a doctor's appointment
 
01:50:32.149 --> 01:50:32.159 align:start position:0%
they're hard to get rescheduled also so
 
01:50:33.830 --> 01:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
is it okay with you
 
01:50:37.030 --> 01:50:37.040 align:start position:0%
if there is a conflict that we attend
 
01:50:40.310 --> 01:50:40.320 align:start position:0%
late if we've got a previous thing that
 
01:50:42.950 --> 01:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
was scheduled
 
01:50:46.149 --> 01:50:46.159 align:start position:0%
um so you know as as always members
 
01:50:47.669 --> 01:50:47.679 align:start position:0%
wander in and out as
 
01:50:50.950 --> 01:50:50.960 align:start position:0%
as they want um but
 
01:50:53.750 --> 01:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
if you're not if you're there and then
 
01:50:55.030 --> 01:50:55.040 align:start position:0%
not there
 
01:50:58.470 --> 01:50:58.480 align:start position:0%
and you miss the exact session that's
 
01:51:01.109 --> 01:51:01.119 align:start position:0%
you've missed the exact session that's
 
01:51:01.910 --> 01:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
the only
 
01:51:05.109 --> 01:51:05.119 align:start position:0%
that's the only um downside to that
 
01:51:07.910 --> 01:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
but no if you come in late that's fine
 
01:51:09.430 --> 01:51:09.440 align:start position:0%
if you dial in late
 
01:51:12.149 --> 01:51:12.159 align:start position:0%
you know or you have to leave early
 
01:51:13.910 --> 01:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
that's always been
 
01:51:17.030 --> 01:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
the practice of every committee
 
01:51:19.510 --> 01:51:19.520 align:start position:0%
it is uh incumbent upon all of us as
 
01:51:19.520 --> 01:51:20.709 align:start position:0%
it is uh incumbent upon all of us as
representatives

01:51:20.709 --> 01:51:20.719 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
01:51:24.070 --> 01:51:24.080 align:start position:0%
to make uh as much of the
 
01:51:26.629 --> 01:51:26.639 align:start position:0%
the hearings and exact sessions as we
 
01:51:26.639 --> 01:51:27.589 align:start position:0%
the hearings and exact sessions as we
can

01:51:27.589 --> 01:51:27.599 align:start position:0%
can
 
01:51:31.109 --> 01:51:31.119 align:start position:0%
um so please make the effort but
 
01:51:33.350 --> 01:51:33.360 align:start position:0%
you're right if you've got a dental if i
 
01:51:35.589 --> 01:51:35.599 align:start position:0%

chairman

01:51:56.070 --> 01:51:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:58.470 --> 01:51:58.480 align:start position:0%
just a couple of things um on the public
 
01:52:01.109 --> 01:52:01.119 align:start position:0%
testimony the way the protocol was
 
01:52:01.119 --> 01:52:02.149 align:start position:0%
testimony the way the protocol was
before

01:52:02.149 --> 01:52:02.159 align:start position:0%
before
 
01:52:05.669 --> 01:52:05.679 align:start position:0%
people pre-registered if they wanted to
 
01:52:08.070 --> 01:52:08.080 align:start position:0%
give testimony and then their uh
 
01:52:09.990 --> 01:52:10.000 align:start position:0%
testimony was emailed out to the
 
01:52:11.910 --> 01:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
committee in advance of the committee
 
01:52:11.920 --> 01:52:12.709 align:start position:0%
committee in advance of the committee
meeting

01:52:12.709 --> 01:52:12.719 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
01:52:16.149 --> 01:52:16.159 align:start position:0%
so that way people who are attending
 
01:52:17.430 --> 01:52:17.440 align:start position:0%
remotely or
 
01:52:19.510 --> 01:52:19.520 align:start position:0%
whatever they're sure to they should be
 
01:52:21.510 --> 01:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
sure to get the documents
 
01:52:23.589 --> 01:52:23.599 align:start position:0%
and i guess i would just um i know you
 
01:52:25.510 --> 01:52:25.520 align:start position:0%
will do this but i would just put in a
 
01:52:25.520 --> 01:52:25.910 align:start position:0%
will do this but i would just put in a
plea

01:52:25.910 --> 01:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
plea
 
01:52:28.629 --> 01:52:28.639 align:start position:0%
that to make people comfortable that are
 
01:52:29.990 --> 01:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
attending remotely when
 
01:52:33.270 --> 01:52:33.280 align:start position:0%
we get to the hybrid format that
 
01:52:35.270 --> 01:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
we all feel that we're able to
 
01:52:37.510 --> 01:52:37.520 align:start position:0%
participate as fully whether we're there
 
01:52:39.669 --> 01:52:39.679 align:start position:0%
remotely or in person
 
01:52:42.550 --> 01:52:42.560 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure hcs is working on all those
 
01:52:44.229 --> 01:52:44.239 align:start position:0%
protocols but i think
 
01:52:47.350 --> 01:52:47.360 align:start position:0%
you know people are concerned about that
 
01:52:50.629 --> 01:52:50.639 align:start position:0%
um they are i and they are continuing to
 
01:52:50.639 --> 01:52:51.589 align:start position:0%
um they are i and they are continuing to
work

01:52:51.589 --> 01:52:51.599 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:52:54.709 --> 01:52:54.719 align:start position:0%
it is my understanding um that there
 
01:52:56.070 --> 01:52:56.080 align:start position:0%
will be one large
 
01:52:58.860 --> 01:52:58.870 align:start position:0%
screen in the room
 
01:52:58.870 --> 01:53:00.310 align:start position:0%
screen in the room
[Music]

01:53:00.310 --> 01:53:00.320 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:53:03.910 --> 01:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
so that those justifying will show up on
 
01:53:04.870 --> 01:53:04.880 align:start position:0%
that if they're
 
01:53:08.470 --> 01:53:08.480 align:start position:0%
they're using zoom or at least their
 
01:53:09.750 --> 01:53:09.760 align:start position:0%
phone number will
 
01:53:12.950 --> 01:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
will show up as as it does here on these
 
01:53:17.910 --> 01:53:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:20.870 --> 01:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
and that brings me to uh to a piece
 
01:53:20.880 --> 01:53:21.669 align:start position:0%
and that brings me to uh to a piece
about

01:53:21.669 --> 01:53:21.679 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:53:25.669 --> 01:53:25.679 align:start position:0%
electronic devices on in the committee
 
01:53:25.679 --> 01:53:28.950 align:start position:0%
electronic devices on in the committee
um

01:53:28.950 --> 01:53:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:32.870 --> 01:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:36.149 --> 01:53:36.159 align:start position:0%
hard to say don't use them
 
01:53:39.109 --> 01:53:39.119 align:start position:0%
um but as you all know if we're sitting
 
01:53:41.109 --> 01:53:41.119 align:start position:0%
around a table
 
01:53:45.030 --> 01:53:45.040 align:start position:0%
and all 23 of us if we're all ever there
 
01:53:48.149 --> 01:53:48.159 align:start position:0%
have a laptop popped up in front of us
 
01:53:51.270 --> 01:53:51.280 align:start position:0%
you know it it is disconcerting to
 
01:53:53.109 --> 01:53:53.119 align:start position:0%
anybody trying to
 
01:53:58.629 --> 01:53:58.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:00.550 --> 01:54:00.560 align:start position:0%
over zoom which is why they're bringing
 
01:54:06.310 --> 01:54:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:08.790 --> 01:54:08.800 align:start position:0%
screen for the committee to be able to
 
01:54:11.350 --> 01:54:11.360 align:start position:0%
see everybody see the same thing
 
01:54:14.229 --> 01:54:14.239 align:start position:0%
now i the clerk or the vice chair or
 
01:54:15.750 --> 01:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
maybe all three
 
01:54:18.229 --> 01:54:18.239 align:start position:0%
or at least the other two are going to
 
01:54:20.470 --> 01:54:20.480 align:start position:0%
have to have something there
 
01:54:24.149 --> 01:54:24.159 align:start position:0%
to look at the remote members
 
01:54:27.510 --> 01:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
and who else is waiting to testify um
 
01:54:30.950 --> 01:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
so we'll have to work on that um
 
01:54:34.070 --> 01:54:34.080 align:start position:0%
to so that if say representative
 
01:54:37.270 --> 01:54:37.280 align:start position:0%
newman or representative graham
 
01:54:39.910 --> 01:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
graham isn't there for participating
 
01:54:39.920 --> 01:54:41.990 align:start position:0%
graham isn't there for participating
remotely

01:54:41.990 --> 01:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
remotely
 
01:54:44.070 --> 01:54:44.080 align:start position:0%
they at least can see if they're raising
 
01:54:46.870 --> 01:54:46.880 align:start position:0%
their hand or whatever
 
01:54:48.870 --> 01:54:48.880 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a challenge and i don't
 
01:54:51.350 --> 01:54:51.360 align:start position:0%
think any of us think that it won't be
 
01:54:56.149 --> 01:54:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:57.830 --> 01:54:57.840 align:start position:0%
as i said earlier i don't think any of
 
01:55:00.390 --> 01:55:00.400 align:start position:0%
you are so shy that you won't say
 
01:55:00.400 --> 01:55:01.510 align:start position:0%
you are so shy that you won't say
something

01:55:01.510 --> 01:55:01.520 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:55:04.870 --> 01:55:04.880 align:start position:0%
that if you're being ignored um
 
01:55:07.109 --> 01:55:07.119 align:start position:0%
you know a little bit more decorum when
 
01:55:08.149 --> 01:55:08.159 align:start position:0%
we've got
 
01:55:10.790 --> 01:55:10.800 align:start position:0%
members of the public there um and i
 
01:55:13.030 --> 01:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
will not and i will refrain from saying
 
01:55:14.229 --> 01:55:14.239 align:start position:0%
karen or john
 
01:55:18.070 --> 01:55:18.080 align:start position:0%
or david when when it's a public hearing
 
01:55:25.270 --> 01:55:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:29.270 --> 01:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:32.229 --> 01:55:32.239 align:start position:0%
work sessions are just that it is a
 
01:55:32.239 --> 01:55:32.870 align:start position:0%
work sessions are just that it is a
meeting

01:55:32.870 --> 01:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
01:55:36.149 --> 01:55:36.159 align:start position:0%
of the committee to work on
 
01:55:38.870 --> 01:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
particular items that may be in front of
 
01:55:38.880 --> 01:55:39.510 align:start position:0%
particular items that may be in front of
them

01:55:39.510 --> 01:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:55:42.709 --> 01:55:42.719 align:start position:0%
it is not a public hearing
 
01:55:45.990 --> 01:55:46.000 align:start position:0%
the chair may invite people to come in
 
01:55:48.149 --> 01:55:48.159 align:start position:0%
and provide information to the work
 
01:55:48.159 --> 01:55:51.030 align:start position:0%
and provide information to the work
session

01:55:51.030 --> 01:55:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:53.510 --> 01:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
but it is not a public hearing in the
 
01:55:55.430 --> 01:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
fact that the entire public can come and
 
01:55:55.440 --> 01:55:56.149 align:start position:0%
fact that the entire public can come and
say

01:55:56.149 --> 01:55:56.159 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:55:58.870 --> 01:55:58.880 align:start position:0%
something at that it will be listed in
 
01:56:01.589 --> 01:56:01.599 align:start position:0%
the calendar and it will be listed as a
 
01:56:04.709 --> 01:56:04.719 align:start position:0%
full committee work session that is the
 
01:56:07.030 --> 01:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
way we will handle most of the capital
 
01:56:07.040 --> 01:56:07.830 align:start position:0%
way we will handle most of the capital
budget

01:56:07.830 --> 01:56:07.840 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:56:10.470 --> 01:56:10.480 align:start position:0%
as we have in the past it'll say full
 
01:56:10.480 --> 01:56:11.109 align:start position:0%
as we have in the past it'll say full
community

01:56:11.109 --> 01:56:11.119 align:start position:0%
community
 
01:56:14.629 --> 01:56:14.639 align:start position:0%
committee work session uh 10 10 to 10
 
01:56:17.910 --> 01:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
15 the adjutant general you know 10
 
01:56:22.310 --> 01:56:22.320 align:start position:0%
20 to 11 o'clock
 
01:56:24.629 --> 01:56:24.639 align:start position:0%
um another agency depending on what
 
01:56:25.830 --> 01:56:25.840 align:start position:0%
they've got
 
01:56:28.470 --> 01:56:28.480 align:start position:0%
but they will be listed and they they
 
01:56:30.790 --> 01:56:30.800 align:start position:0%
are that
 
01:56:33.750 --> 01:56:33.760 align:start position:0%
and they are conducted along the same
 
01:56:33.760 --> 01:56:34.470 align:start position:0%
and they are conducted along the same
lines

01:56:34.470 --> 01:56:34.480 align:start position:0%
lines
 
01:56:38.229 --> 01:56:38.239 align:start position:0%
as a public hearing as far as decorum
 
01:56:40.790 --> 01:56:40.800 align:start position:0%
asking questions getting permission from
 
01:56:41.750 --> 01:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
the chair
 
01:56:44.070 --> 01:56:44.080 align:start position:0%
to ask questions of whomever is
 
01:56:44.080 --> 01:56:45.990 align:start position:0%
to ask questions of whomever is
presenting

01:56:45.990 --> 01:56:46.000 align:start position:0%
presenting
 
01:56:49.350 --> 01:56:49.360 align:start position:0%
so just be aware that those will come up
 
01:56:51.990 --> 01:56:52.000 align:start position:0%
and that's important because you know
 
01:56:55.750 --> 01:56:55.760 align:start position:0%
once we get into the capital budget
 
01:56:59.430 --> 01:56:59.440 align:start position:0%
we do hear from every agency and we have
 
01:57:02.229 --> 01:57:02.239 align:start position:0%
in the second year we have work sessions
 
01:57:02.950 --> 01:57:02.960 align:start position:0%
on the
 
01:57:05.830 --> 01:57:05.840 align:start position:0%
10-year transportation plan as well as
 
01:57:07.669 --> 01:57:07.679 align:start position:0%
well as public hearings which are
 
01:57:07.679 --> 01:57:08.709 align:start position:0%
well as public hearings which are
different

01:57:08.709 --> 01:57:08.719 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:57:12.790 --> 01:57:12.800 align:start position:0%
we'll have we'll open in all probability
 
01:57:15.430 --> 01:57:15.440 align:start position:0%
work sessions on the capital budget
 
01:57:17.510 --> 01:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
before the bill is printed
 
01:57:21.189 --> 01:57:21.199 align:start position:0%
um i think we've done that in the past
 
01:57:24.070 --> 01:57:24.080 align:start position:0%
just so that we can get started and then
 
01:57:28.310 --> 01:57:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:30.310 --> 01:57:30.320 align:start position:0%
a public hearing so that people can come
 
01:57:32.950 --> 01:57:32.960 align:start position:0%
in most of the agencies will wait until
 
01:57:33.830 --> 01:57:33.840 align:start position:0%
their time
 
01:57:35.830 --> 01:57:35.840 align:start position:0%
knowing that they have a work session
 
01:57:37.669 --> 01:57:37.679 align:start position:0%
but members of the public
 
01:57:41.589 --> 01:57:41.599 align:start position:0%
will come in and say their piece on
 
01:57:43.669 --> 01:57:43.679 align:start position:0%
what they think the state should do or
 
01:57:45.109 --> 01:57:45.119 align:start position:0%
not do
 
01:57:48.070 --> 01:57:48.080 align:start position:0%
for capital improvements and how to
 
01:57:48.080 --> 01:57:48.550 align:start position:0%
for capital improvements and how to
spend

01:57:48.550 --> 01:57:48.560 align:start position:0%
spend
 
01:57:51.750 --> 01:57:51.760 align:start position:0%
money then we'll close that recess that
 
01:57:52.790 --> 01:57:52.800 align:start position:0%
not close it
 
01:57:56.390 --> 01:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
recess that until after all the agencies
 
01:57:58.629 --> 01:57:58.639 align:start position:0%
have had and then we'll go into another
 
01:57:59.910 --> 01:57:59.920 align:start position:0%
public hearing
 
01:58:03.030 --> 01:58:03.040 align:start position:0%
and then into exact session it's
 
01:58:06.229 --> 01:58:06.239 align:start position:0%
kind of convoluted i got
 
01:58:09.350 --> 01:58:09.360 align:start position:0%
lost my first term on it but
 
01:58:13.189 --> 01:58:13.199 align:start position:0%
found my way eventually um
 
01:58:14.790 --> 01:58:14.800 align:start position:0%
any questions about work sessions
 
01:58:16.629 --> 01:58:16.639 align:start position:0%
they're they are
 
01:58:19.109 --> 01:58:19.119 align:start position:0%
less formal but still the decorum has to
 
01:58:22.390 --> 01:58:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:25.750 --> 01:58:25.760 align:start position:0%
executive sessions are just that
 
01:58:29.430 --> 01:58:29.440 align:start position:0%
there are sessions amongst ourselves
 
01:58:32.070 --> 01:58:32.080 align:start position:0%
to determine the fate of any particular
 
01:58:35.830 --> 01:58:35.840 align:start position:0%
bill that's in front of us
 
01:58:38.709 --> 01:58:38.719 align:start position:0%
we have to have a quorum a quorum in
 
01:58:39.669 --> 01:58:39.679 align:start position:0%
this case being
 
01:58:43.589 --> 01:58:43.599 align:start position:0%
12 or more members in attendance
 
01:58:46.870 --> 01:58:46.880 align:start position:0%
physically in attendance either in the
 
01:58:49.430 --> 01:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
in the room or via zoom if we're doing
 
01:58:49.440 --> 01:58:50.629 align:start position:0%
in the room or via zoom if we're doing
hybrid

01:58:50.629 --> 01:58:50.639 align:start position:0%
hybrid
 
01:58:53.830 --> 01:58:53.840 align:start position:0%
um if you know that you will not be
 
01:58:53.840 --> 01:58:55.109 align:start position:0%
um if you know that you will not be
present

01:58:55.109 --> 01:58:55.119 align:start position:0%
present
 
01:58:57.750 --> 01:58:57.760 align:start position:0%
please let me the vice chair
 
01:58:59.189 --> 01:58:59.199 align:start position:0%
representative mcconkey
 
01:59:02.030 --> 01:59:02.040 align:start position:0%
his phone number is five two zero
 
01:59:02.040 --> 01:59:04.229 align:start position:0%
his phone number is five two zero
520-8275

01:59:04.229 --> 01:59:04.239 align:start position:0%
520-8275
 
01:59:09.310 --> 01:59:09.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:09.320 --> 01:59:11.430 align:start position:0%
 
520-8275

01:59:11.430 --> 01:59:11.440 align:start position:0%
520-8275
 
01:59:13.669 --> 01:59:13.679 align:start position:0%
know the day before that you will not
 
01:59:16.550 --> 01:59:16.560 align:start position:0%
make the executive session
 
01:59:19.430 --> 01:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
so that we can get a replacement for you
 
01:59:21.589 --> 01:59:21.599 align:start position:0%
i would ask that the democratic members

01:59:36.960 --> 01:59:38.390 align:start position:0%
because to be honest and this is my
partisanship

01:59:38.390 --> 01:59:38.400 align:start position:0%
partisanship
 
01:59:40.470 --> 01:59:40.480 align:start position:0%
one time showing i'm not going to work
 
01:59:42.149 --> 01:59:42.159 align:start position:0%

01:59:42.159 --> 01:59:44.550 align:start position:0%
real hard on getting democratic
replacements

01:59:44.550 --> 01:59:44.560 align:start position:0%
replacements
 
01:59:46.310 --> 01:59:46.320 align:start position:0%
if you're not going to be an executive
 
01:59:46.320 --> 01:59:48.790 align:start position:0%
if you're not going to be an executive
session

01:59:48.790 --> 01:59:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:51.510 --> 01:59:51.520 align:start position:0%
all replacements must be appointed by
 
01:59:52.550 --> 01:59:52.560 align:start position:0%
the speaker
 
01:59:55.189 --> 01:59:55.199 align:start position:0%
i can't just go out in the hallway nor
 
01:59:55.199 --> 01:59:56.229 align:start position:0%
i can't just go out in the hallway nor
can

01:59:56.229 --> 01:59:56.239 align:start position:0%

whomever um but if the speaker appoints
 
02:00:10.400 --> 02:00:11.109 align:start position:0%
whomever um but if the speaker appoints
them

02:00:11.109 --> 02:00:11.119 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:00:13.189 --> 02:00:13.199 align:start position:0%
they become voting members for the
 
02:00:16.550 --> 02:00:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:19.189 --> 02:00:19.199 align:start position:0%
most times we don't need them because
 
02:00:21.189 --> 02:00:21.199 align:start position:0%
we've already reached consensus on what
 
02:00:23.030 --> 02:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to do with the bill
 
02:00:26.070 --> 02:00:26.080 align:start position:0%
and if it ends up being you know
 
02:00:29.510 --> 02:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
21 to 2 so be it
 
02:00:32.550 --> 02:00:32.560 align:start position:0%
i'd rather have it 23-0 but
 
02:00:35.109 --> 02:00:35.119 align:start position:0%
if the overwhelming majority of the
 
02:00:37.750 --> 02:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
committee is supportive
 
02:00:42.950 --> 02:00:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:45.990 --> 02:00:46.000 align:start position:0%
just so everybody knows and
 
02:00:47.990 --> 02:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
those who have been chairs know this as
 
02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:49.030 align:start position:0%
those who have been chairs know this as
well

02:00:49.030 --> 02:00:49.040 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:00:51.910 --> 02:00:51.920 align:start position:0%
i can adjourn the executive session at
 
02:00:52.950 --> 02:00:52.960 align:start position:0%
any point
 
02:00:54.709 --> 02:00:54.719 align:start position:0%
where i don't think i'm going to get the
 
02:00:58.070 --> 02:00:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:01.189 --> 02:01:01.199 align:start position:0%
just the power of being the chair up
 
02:01:02.550 --> 02:01:02.560 align:start position:0%
until the time
 
02:01:04.709 --> 02:01:04.719 align:start position:0%
that the question is put to the members
 
02:01:06.149 --> 02:01:06.159 align:start position:0%
for a vote
 
02:01:09.350 --> 02:01:09.360 align:start position:0%
if two minutes before that happens
 
02:01:11.830 --> 02:01:11.840 align:start position:0%
um it looks like the motion that is on
 
02:01:14.310 --> 02:01:14.320 align:start position:0%
the floor that i may or may not want
 
02:01:16.790 --> 02:01:16.800 align:start position:0%
is not going to go the way that that i
 
02:01:18.149 --> 02:01:18.159 align:start position:0%
think it should
 
02:01:21.109 --> 02:01:21.119 align:start position:0%
i can i can adjourn the exact executive
 
02:01:23.350 --> 02:01:23.360 align:start position:0%
session to another time
 
02:01:25.750 --> 02:01:25.760 align:start position:0%
and then work on it we may still be the
 
02:01:27.830 --> 02:01:27.840 align:start position:0%
same outcome the next time but
 
02:01:30.790 --> 02:01:30.800 align:start position:0%
that is one of the powers that the chair
 
02:01:30.800 --> 02:01:33.109 align:start position:0%
that is one of the powers that the chair
has

02:01:33.109 --> 02:01:33.119 align:start position:0%
has
 
02:01:35.109 --> 02:01:35.119 align:start position:0%
the other thing that i need to point out
 
02:01:37.189 --> 02:01:37.199 align:start position:0%
about executive sessions everybody knows
 
02:01:37.199 --> 02:01:38.149 align:start position:0%
about executive sessions everybody knows
this

02:01:38.149 --> 02:01:38.159 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:01:40.870 --> 02:01:40.880 align:start position:0%
is that there is no public import
 
02:01:42.709 --> 02:01:42.719 align:start position:0%
without my approval
 
02:01:48.390 --> 02:01:48.400 align:start position:0%
it is not another executive session
 
02:01:51.030 --> 02:01:51.040 align:start position:0%
and it's not another public hearing if
 
02:01:53.589 --> 02:01:53.599 align:start position:0%
you have specific questions
 
02:01:56.390 --> 02:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
um post them to me and i will decide
 
02:01:58.709 --> 02:01:58.719 align:start position:0%
whether or not to pose it to a sponsor
 
02:01:59.910 --> 02:01:59.920 align:start position:0%
or agency
 
02:02:02.470 --> 02:02:02.480 align:start position:0%
or whomever this does not mean that
 
02:02:05.350 --> 02:02:05.360 align:start position:0%
you're not free to go out
 
02:02:08.950 --> 02:02:08.960 align:start position:0%
and ask questions of sponsors lobbyists
 
02:02:10.550 --> 02:02:10.560 align:start position:0%
or whomever
 
02:02:12.470 --> 02:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
before the exact session to try to get
 
02:02:13.990 --> 02:02:14.000 align:start position:0%
your question answered
 
02:02:18.070 --> 02:02:18.080 align:start position:0%
after the public hearing but
 
02:02:21.189 --> 02:02:21.199 align:start position:0%
i don't want to turn exec sessions into
 
02:02:23.910 --> 02:02:23.920 align:start position:0%
um a second public hearing if at all
 
02:02:23.920 --> 02:02:26.070 align:start position:0%
um a second public hearing if at all
possible

02:02:26.070 --> 02:02:26.080 align:start position:0%
possible
 
02:02:28.629 --> 02:02:28.639 align:start position:0%
all amendments that are being proposed
 
02:02:30.550 --> 02:02:30.560 align:start position:0%
and any one of you can propose an
 
02:02:32.629 --> 02:02:32.639 align:start position:0%
amendment to any bill we have
 
02:02:34.500 --> 02:02:34.510 align:start position:0%
has to be prepared by
 
02:02:34.510 --> 02:02:35.750 align:start position:0%
has to be prepared by
[Music]

02:02:35.750 --> 02:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:02:39.189 --> 02:02:39.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:42.470 --> 02:02:42.480 align:start position:0%
and we will get
 
02:02:46.229 --> 02:02:46.239 align:start position:0%
copies printed and brought down to
 
02:02:49.669 --> 02:02:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:53.830 --> 02:02:53.840 align:start position:0%
i think everybody knows what the basic
 
02:02:57.030 --> 02:02:57.040 align:start position:0%
motions that can be heard in in a
 
02:03:01.109 --> 02:03:01.119 align:start position:0%
executive session are thought to pass
 
02:03:04.790 --> 02:03:04.800 align:start position:0%
out to pass his amendment an expedient
 
02:03:05.990 --> 02:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
to legislate
 
02:03:08.790 --> 02:03:08.800 align:start position:0%
or retain and retain is only for this
 
02:03:08.800 --> 02:03:09.830 align:start position:0%
or retain and retain is only for this
year

02:03:09.830 --> 02:03:09.840 align:start position:0%
year
 
02:03:12.709 --> 02:03:12.719 align:start position:0%
what that means is we will hold the bill
 
02:03:14.390 --> 02:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
for additional work in the
 
02:03:17.910 --> 02:03:17.920 align:start position:0%
summer or fall and then come back in the
 
02:03:17.920 --> 02:03:18.310 align:start position:0%
summer or fall and then come back in the
fall

02:03:18.310 --> 02:03:18.320 align:start position:0%
fall
 
02:03:22.470 --> 02:03:22.480 align:start position:0%
for a uh final executive session on the
 
02:03:22.480 --> 02:03:23.270 align:start position:0%
for a uh final executive session on the
bill

02:03:23.270 --> 02:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:03:25.990 --> 02:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
so the house can vote on it in next
 
02:03:27.750 --> 02:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
january january of
 
02:03:27.760 --> 02:03:32.950 align:start position:0%
january january of
22.

02:03:32.950 --> 02:03:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:35.270 --> 02:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
for in order for an amendment to come
 
02:03:35.280 --> 02:03:36.629 align:start position:0%
for in order for an amendment to come
forward

02:03:36.629 --> 02:03:36.639 align:start position:0%
forward
 
02:03:38.790 --> 02:03:38.800 align:start position:0%
there has to be a positive motion i
 
02:03:40.870 --> 02:03:40.880 align:start position:0%
ought to pass
 
02:03:43.189 --> 02:03:43.199 align:start position:0%
motion on the floor in the committee
 
02:03:44.709 --> 02:03:44.719 align:start position:0%
just because you have an amendment
 
02:03:44.719 --> 02:03:45.589 align:start position:0%
just because you have an amendment
prepared

02:03:45.589 --> 02:03:45.599 align:start position:0%
prepared
 
02:03:47.109 --> 02:03:47.119 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that the committee's going
 
02:03:49.109 --> 02:03:49.119 align:start position:0%
to take it up if there is
 
02:03:52.870 --> 02:03:52.880 align:start position:0%
not um and not to pass motion or
 
02:03:58.629 --> 02:03:58.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:01.830 --> 02:04:01.840 align:start position:0%
i get to call who makes the
 
02:04:04.870 --> 02:04:04.880 align:start position:0%
motion and
 
02:04:08.390 --> 02:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
as many times
 
02:04:10.149 --> 02:04:10.159 align:start position:0%
as some of the returning members will
 
02:04:12.149 --> 02:04:12.159 align:start position:0%
know prior
 
02:04:16.790 --> 02:04:16.800 align:start position:0%

um so david i'll i'll forward that to
you

02:08:45.430 --> 02:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:08:49.910 --> 02:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
and that's it if we're in the building
 
02:08:49.920 --> 02:08:50.390 align:start position:0%
and that's it if we're in the building
there

02:08:50.390 --> 02:08:50.400 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:08:54.229 --> 02:08:54.239 align:start position:0%
is on the fourth floor if we get it open
 
02:08:58.390 --> 02:08:58.400 align:start position:0%
um computer support
 
02:09:01.830 --> 02:09:01.840 align:start position:0%
all um letterhead all that kind of stuff
 
02:09:03.669 --> 02:09:03.679 align:start position:0%
that you may need
 
02:09:06.629 --> 02:09:06.639 align:start position:0%
on the fourth floor of the lob and there
 
02:09:09.430 --> 02:09:09.440 align:start position:0%
is wi-fi both in the state house
 
02:09:12.470 --> 02:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
and the lob that members can access
 
02:09:15.669 --> 02:09:15.679 align:start position:0%
um so that kind of
 
02:09:19.910 --> 02:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
it in a nutshell any questions of
 
02:09:23.109 --> 02:09:23.119 align:start position:0%
what the committee does how we work
 
02:09:26.310 --> 02:09:26.320 align:start position:0%
and it's a work in progress as far as
 
02:09:26.320 --> 02:09:27.030 align:start position:0%
and it's a work in progress as far as
hybrid

02:09:27.030 --> 02:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
hybrid
 
02:09:30.629 --> 02:09:30.639 align:start position:0%
and and the rest but best i can give you
 
02:09:35.430 --> 02:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:39.750 --> 02:09:39.760 align:start position:0%

good morning just give it a couple
 
02:15:05.910 --> 02:15:05.920 align:start position:0%
minutes as people come back
 
02:15:07.430 --> 02:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
they've been we've been sitting here for

two hours so no that i totally
 
02:15:09.760 --> 02:15:10.629 align:start position:0%
two hours so no that i totally
understand

02:15:10.629 --> 02:15:10.639 align:start position:0%
understand
 
02:15:14.709 --> 02:15:14.719 align:start position:0%
so whenever everybody's ready ready um
 
02:15:17.510 --> 02:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
there is one piece of decorum i forgot
 
02:15:19.750 --> 02:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
to mention to all the members
 
02:15:22.550 --> 02:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
if we're in the building in a committee
 
02:15:22.560 --> 02:15:23.510 align:start position:0%
if we're in the building in a committee
room

02:15:23.510 --> 02:15:23.520 align:start position:0%

tell us what to do
 
02:16:59.190 --> 02:16:59.200 align:start position:0%

mike kane who's the legislative budget
 
02:18:37.030 --> 02:18:37.040 align:start position:0%
assistant deals primarily with the
 
02:18:38.950 --> 02:18:38.960 align:start position:0%
audit side of the house and that's
 
02:18:40.790 --> 02:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
intentional um we we
 
02:18:43.910 --> 02:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
try to keep a wall between us so that
 
02:18:46.469 --> 02:18:46.479 align:start position:0%
they can do their work uninterrupted by
 
02:18:48.309 --> 02:18:48.319 align:start position:0%
um things that we may be doing on the
 
02:18:50.830 --> 02:18:50.840 align:start position:0%
budget side and working with members
 
02:18:53.910 --> 02:18:53.920 align:start position:0%
um i did work on the audit side for 10
 
02:18:55.509 --> 02:18:55.519 align:start position:0%
years before coming to the budget side
 
02:18:55.910 --> 02:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
so i'm
 
02:18:57.830 --> 02:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
very familiar with you know what happens
 
02:18:59.669 --> 02:18:59.679 align:start position:0%
on that side of the house
 
02:19:01.669 --> 02:19:01.679 align:start position:0%
but i just wanted to kind of talk that
 
02:19:03.270 --> 02:19:03.280 align:start position:0%
through with you a little bit
 
02:19:05.669 --> 02:19:05.679 align:start position:0%
um i've been doing the capital budget
 
02:19:07.190 --> 02:19:07.200 align:start position:0%
the last couple of years
 
02:19:09.509 --> 02:19:09.519 align:start position:0%
um so i have some familiarity with it
 
02:19:10.950 --> 02:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
been doing revenues a little bit longer
 
02:19:12.070 --> 02:19:12.080 align:start position:0%
and prior to that
 
02:19:14.150 --> 02:19:14.160 align:start position:0%
um i dealt with the operating budget
 
02:19:16.790 --> 02:19:16.800 align:start position:0%
from 2007 when i came over to the budget
 
02:19:16.800 --> 02:19:17.750 align:start position:0%
from 2007 when i came over to the budget
side

02:19:17.750 --> 02:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
side
 
02:19:19.750 --> 02:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
so that's just a you know a real brief
 
02:19:20.870 --> 02:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
kind of overview
 
02:19:23.910 --> 02:19:23.920 align:start position:0%
of who we are who i am um

02:19:28.709 --> 02:19:28.719 align:start position:0%
services in our office that you may be
 
02:19:30.389 --> 02:19:30.399 align:start position:0%
familiar with is when you see a bill
 
02:19:32.070 --> 02:19:32.080 align:start position:0%

and um you know we can have a discussion
 
02:19:47.270 --> 02:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
with you as to why
 
02:19:48.710 --> 02:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
the bill may or may not have had a
 
02:19:50.630 --> 02:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
fiscal note and if it does have a fiscal
 
02:19:51.830 --> 02:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
note how to end it up with that
 
02:19:53.990 --> 02:19:54.000 align:start position:0%

02:20:03.270 --> 02:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
but i was going to
 
02:20:04.630 --> 02:20:04.640 align:start position:0%
bring it up on the screen because i
 
02:20:06.630 --> 02:20:06.640 align:start position:0%

02:20:09.110 --> 02:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
on our website as well to show you some
 
02:20:11.030 --> 02:20:11.040 align:start position:0%

02:22:12.800 --> 02:22:17.270 align:start position:0%
i'll go back to those after the
presentation

02:22:17.270 --> 02:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:18.630 --> 02:22:18.640 align:start position:0%
so here we are with the the capital
 
02:22:21.510 --> 02:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
budget presentation
 
02:22:24.150 --> 02:22:24.160 align:start position:0%
this is the contact information um you
 
02:22:26.389 --> 02:22:26.399 align:start position:0%
know as as everybody's fully aware
 
02:22:29.270 --> 02:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
um we're limitedly in the office at this
 
02:22:29.280 --> 02:22:29.910 align:start position:0%
um we're limitedly in the office at this
time

02:22:29.910 --> 02:22:29.920 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:22:31.429 --> 02:22:31.439 align:start position:0%
in fact for the next week or so we've
 
02:22:33.670 --> 02:22:33.680 align:start position:0%
been asked not to go into the office
 
02:22:36.070 --> 02:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
um so the best way to contact us is
 
02:22:37.510 --> 02:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
through emails
 
02:22:39.670 --> 02:22:39.680 align:start position:0%
we do check our phone numbers uh our
 
02:22:41.429 --> 02:22:41.439 align:start position:0%
phone lines on a regular basis but an
 
02:22:43.190 --> 02:22:43.200 align:start position:0%
email is much easier
 
02:22:45.510 --> 02:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
um particularly if we're on a remote
 
02:22:47.110 --> 02:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
call sometimes we can
 
02:22:49.670 --> 02:22:49.680 align:start position:0%
um respond to an email as we're on that
 
02:22:51.349 --> 02:22:51.359 align:start position:0%
and take care of an issue that you might
 
02:22:57.110 --> 02:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:58.790 --> 02:22:58.800 align:start position:0%
so the next page is just the table of
 
02:23:00.309 --> 02:23:00.319 align:start position:0%
contents of what's contained in this
 
02:23:02.230 --> 02:23:02.240 align:start position:0%
particular document
 
02:23:04.389 --> 02:23:04.399 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to go through but not
 
02:23:06.309 --> 02:23:06.319 align:start position:0%
necessarily through every single
 
02:23:09.510 --> 02:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
item that's in here i may go kind of
 
02:23:11.270 --> 02:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
go over some of these rather quickly
 
02:23:12.870 --> 02:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
because it's not necessary to get a lot
 
02:23:17.270 --> 02:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:20.389 --> 02:23:20.399 align:start position:0%
but this first part is rsa93 the statute
 
02:23:20.399 --> 02:23:20.710 align:start position:0%
but this first part is rsa93 the statute
that

02:23:20.710 --> 02:23:20.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:23:23.190 --> 02:23:23.200 align:start position:0%
um basically starts the the capital
 
02:23:25.270 --> 02:23:25.280 align:start position:0%
budget process
 
02:23:27.270 --> 02:23:27.280 align:start position:0%
so if you're not familiar with the
 
02:23:28.870 --> 02:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
capital budget process it actually
 
02:23:28.880 --> 02:23:29.670 align:start position:0%
capital budget process it actually
started

02:23:29.670 --> 02:23:29.680 align:start position:0%
started
 
02:23:32.710 --> 02:23:32.720 align:start position:0%
um back in april
 
02:23:35.750 --> 02:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
time frame for the agencies so
 
02:23:37.270 --> 02:23:37.280 align:start position:0%
they have been they were instructed at
 
02:23:38.550 --> 02:23:38.560 align:start position:0%
that time to think about capital
 
02:23:40.150 --> 02:23:40.160 align:start position:0%
projects that they needed and needed to
 
02:23:41.670 --> 02:23:41.680 align:start position:0%
submit something
 
02:23:45.429 --> 02:23:45.439 align:start position:0%
um by the end of um by may 1st and then
 
02:23:45.990 --> 02:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
by the end
 
02:23:48.550 --> 02:23:48.560 align:start position:0%
of may a document was provided to the
 
02:23:48.560 --> 02:23:49.910 align:start position:0%
of may a document was provided to the
governor

02:23:49.910 --> 02:23:49.920 align:start position:0%
governor
 
02:23:51.830 --> 02:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
that he then had to have budget hearings
 
02:23:55.030 --> 02:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
on before the end of june
 
02:23:56.630 --> 02:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
those did occur and as i pointed out
 
02:23:58.950 --> 02:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
those those documents that agencies
 
02:23:59.750 --> 02:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
brought to that
 
02:24:02.630 --> 02:24:02.640 align:start position:0%
meeting are available online so you're
 
02:24:05.030 --> 02:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
able to look at that
 
02:24:08.630 --> 02:24:08.640 align:start position:0%
once that occurred the governor
 
02:24:11.270 --> 02:24:11.280 align:start position:0%
along with the director of public works
 
02:24:13.110 --> 02:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
and several other individuals will
 
02:24:14.870 --> 02:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
look at the various projects that are
 
02:24:17.270 --> 02:24:17.280 align:start position:0%
brought forward by agencies
 
02:24:19.270 --> 02:24:19.280 align:start position:0%
and identify with those that they think
 
02:24:21.349 --> 02:24:21.359 align:start position:0%
need further work or detail
 
02:24:24.150 --> 02:24:24.160 align:start position:0%
to be considered for the 2223 capital
 
02:24:24.160 --> 02:24:26.070 align:start position:0%
to be considered for the 2223 capital
budget

02:24:26.070 --> 02:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
budget
 
02:24:28.950 --> 02:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
so that is done by the department of
 
02:24:30.550 --> 02:24:30.560 align:start position:0%
administrative services uh
 
02:24:32.309 --> 02:24:32.319 align:start position:0%
bureau of public works where they go in
 
02:24:35.030 --> 02:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
and refine the numbers um
 
02:24:36.870 --> 02:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
look at issues that may may not have
 
02:24:38.469 --> 02:24:38.479 align:start position:0%
been considered by the agency as they're
 
02:24:38.479 --> 02:24:39.349 align:start position:0%
been considered by the agency as they're
putting

02:24:39.349 --> 02:24:39.359 align:start position:0%
putting
 
02:24:41.349 --> 02:24:41.359 align:start position:0%
uh together the project the cost and
 
02:24:42.710 --> 02:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
what they need to do
 
02:24:45.590 --> 02:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
and then they establish a book and it's
 
02:24:45.600 --> 02:24:46.389 align:start position:0%
and then they establish a book and it's
a

02:24:46.389 --> 02:24:46.399 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:24:48.230 --> 02:24:48.240 align:start position:0%
it's called the capital improvement book
 
02:24:50.070 --> 02:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
program book i have a
 
02:24:53.590 --> 02:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
copy i have a hard copy right here i
 
02:24:55.110 --> 02:24:55.120 align:start position:0%
have hard copies for all the members
 
02:24:55.990 --> 02:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
they're sitting in my
 
02:24:57.510 --> 02:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
office i just have to figure out how to
 
02:25:00.389 --> 02:25:00.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:02.389 --> 02:25:02.399 align:start position:0%
and from that they work and put together
 
02:25:03.750 --> 02:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
the governor's capital budget the
 
02:25:06.309 --> 02:25:06.319 align:start position:0%
governor's capital budget will come out
 
02:25:08.950 --> 02:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
by february 15th the operating budget in
 
02:25:10.469 --> 02:25:10.479 align:start position:0%
the capital budget are released
 
02:25:13.830 --> 02:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:16.630 --> 02:25:16.640 align:start position:0%
and that's what you see down right there
 
02:25:17.990 --> 02:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
is that's when the governor needs to
 
02:25:22.950 --> 02:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:25.270 --> 02:25:25.280 align:start position:0%
the capital budget is considered a
 
02:25:25.280 --> 02:25:26.630 align:start position:0%
the capital budget is considered a
six-year

02:25:26.630 --> 02:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
six-year
 
02:25:29.830 --> 02:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
plan even though the appropriations
 
02:25:31.590 --> 02:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
um potentially could lapse after two
 
02:25:33.670 --> 02:25:33.680 align:start position:0%
years and that's something that your
 
02:25:33.680 --> 02:25:34.230 align:start position:0%
years and that's something that your
committee

02:25:34.230 --> 02:25:34.240 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:25:36.150 --> 02:25:36.160 align:start position:0%
often looks at to see doesn't is there
 
02:25:37.990 --> 02:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
an extension necessary for a project or
 
02:25:39.590 --> 02:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
did it get completed within the first
 
02:25:40.790 --> 02:25:40.800 align:start position:0%
two years
 
02:25:42.389 --> 02:25:42.399 align:start position:0%
and if you're going to extend it you may
 
02:25:44.150 --> 02:25:44.160 align:start position:0%
want information from an agency as to
 
02:25:44.160 --> 02:25:45.110 align:start position:0%
want information from an agency as to
why

02:25:45.110 --> 02:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
why
 
02:25:46.710 --> 02:25:46.720 align:start position:0%
um and that's something again i'll kind
 
02:25:48.150 --> 02:25:48.160 align:start position:0%
of talk about that as we get through
 
02:25:48.160 --> 02:25:48.550 align:start position:0%
of talk about that as we get through
this

02:25:48.550 --> 02:25:48.560 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:25:52.550 --> 02:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
this document there are other
 
02:25:54.230 --> 02:25:54.240 align:start position:0%
places in statute where the capital
 
02:25:55.670 --> 02:25:55.680 align:start position:0%
budget comes up for instance the
 
02:25:55.680 --> 02:25:56.389 align:start position:0%
budget comes up for instance the
lakeshore

02:25:56.389 --> 02:25:56.399 align:start position:0%
lakeshore
 
02:25:58.550 --> 02:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
uh redevelopment planning commission you
 
02:25:59.750 --> 02:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
know there was
 
02:26:01.590 --> 02:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
a segment of their statute that said
 
02:26:03.670 --> 02:26:03.680 align:start position:0%
that they could submit information
 
02:26:06.790 --> 02:26:06.800 align:start position:0%
for capital purposes in the 20 20
 
02:26:10.710 --> 02:26:10.720 align:start position:0%
to the 2020 2021 capital budget
 
02:26:14.469 --> 02:26:14.479 align:start position:0%
um the ctes which are at the schools
 
02:26:16.389 --> 02:26:16.399 align:start position:0%
um there's language in here related to
 
02:26:19.270 --> 02:26:19.280 align:start position:0%
that so that's what these rsas relate to
 
02:26:20.870 --> 02:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
i just want to include them
 
02:26:22.630 --> 02:26:22.640 align:start position:0%
they're for your leisure not necessarily
 
02:26:24.230 --> 02:26:24.240 align:start position:0%
something that we need to talk about in
 
02:26:26.469 --> 02:26:26.479 align:start position:0%
terms of process at this time but
 
02:26:29.590 --> 02:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
if you see the governor's capital budget
 
02:26:31.270 --> 02:26:31.280 align:start position:0%
in february and you're wondering
 
02:26:32.790 --> 02:26:32.800 align:start position:0%
how did this end up in there there may
 
02:26:34.469 --> 02:26:34.479 align:start position:0%
have been a statutory direction to
 
02:26:35.910 --> 02:26:35.920 align:start position:0%
include it in the budget
 
02:26:37.910 --> 02:26:37.920 align:start position:0%
there may not be but i just here are a
 
02:26:39.190 --> 02:26:39.200 align:start position:0%
few of the statutes you may need to
 
02:26:44.070 --> 02:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:46.830 --> 02:26:46.840 align:start position:0%
so and i apologize for the uh the
 
02:26:46.840 --> 02:26:48.550 align:start position:0%
so and i apologize for the uh the
scrolling

02:26:48.550 --> 02:26:48.560 align:start position:0%
scrolling
 
02:26:51.110 --> 02:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
so this page here it's page eight of the
 
02:26:51.120 --> 02:26:52.630 align:start position:0%
so this page here it's page eight of the
presentation

02:26:52.630 --> 02:26:52.640 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
02:26:55.110 --> 02:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
that is kind of a one pager to show you
 
02:26:55.990 --> 02:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
the process
 
02:26:57.830 --> 02:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
um and where you know when it starts and
 
02:26:59.429 --> 02:26:59.439 align:start position:0%
when it ends
 
02:27:02.389 --> 02:27:02.399 align:start position:0%
so as i mentioned the agencies that
 
02:27:04.150 --> 02:27:04.160 align:start position:0%
started this process before may 1st they
 
02:27:07.110 --> 02:27:07.120 align:start position:0%
had to have information ready by may 1st
 
02:27:09.110 --> 02:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
the governor had information provided by
 
02:27:10.630 --> 02:27:10.640 align:start position:0%
may 31st
 
02:27:12.550 --> 02:27:12.560 align:start position:0%
and then he held hearings by the end of
 
02:27:14.710 --> 02:27:14.720 align:start position:0%
june and since then there's been efforts
 
02:27:16.550 --> 02:27:16.560 align:start position:0%
to to consolidate some of the projects
 
02:27:17.830 --> 02:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
or look at some of the projects that
 
02:27:19.429 --> 02:27:19.439 align:start position:0%
they that were being proposed
 
02:27:21.510 --> 02:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
and include them with further detail in
 
02:27:23.190 --> 02:27:23.200 align:start position:0%
in the capital improvement
 
02:27:28.389 --> 02:27:28.399 align:start position:0%
uh program document come february 15th
 
02:27:30.550 --> 02:27:30.560 align:start position:0%
the uh capital budget will then be in
 
02:27:32.309 --> 02:27:32.319 align:start position:0%
the possession of the house
 
02:27:34.150 --> 02:27:34.160 align:start position:0%
and you'll have until crossover which is
 
02:27:36.309 --> 02:27:36.319 align:start position:0%
typically the end of march beginning of
 
02:27:37.429 --> 02:27:37.439 align:start position:0%
april to
 
02:27:39.190 --> 02:27:39.200 align:start position:0%
make all your decisions as it relates to
 
02:27:40.710 --> 02:27:40.720 align:start position:0%
the capital budget
 
02:27:42.870 --> 02:27:42.880 align:start position:0%
um and then as i heard represent graham
 
02:27:44.230 --> 02:27:44.240 align:start position:0%
mentioning earlier
 
02:27:46.550 --> 02:27:46.560 align:start position:0%
you know as part of the process we will
 
02:27:47.510 --> 02:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
help you
 
02:27:49.429 --> 02:27:49.439 align:start position:0%
decide which agencies to bring into
 
02:27:50.950 --> 02:27:50.960 align:start position:0%
before the committee to discuss what
 
02:27:50.960 --> 02:27:51.349 align:start position:0%
before the committee to discuss what
their

02:27:51.349 --> 02:27:51.359 align:start position:0%
their
 
02:27:53.910 --> 02:27:53.920 align:start position:0%
projects are and what they're requesting
 
02:27:55.190 --> 02:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
and what could happen
 
02:27:57.670 --> 02:27:57.680 align:start position:0%
if you can't fully fund something or if
 
02:27:58.550 --> 02:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
you think there should be another
 
02:28:00.710 --> 02:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
project in its place
 
02:28:02.550 --> 02:28:02.560 align:start position:0%
so we would help coordinate the agencies
 
02:28:04.309 --> 02:28:04.319 align:start position:0%
to come in and do that
 
02:28:07.110 --> 02:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
i say we um i should mention too where
 
02:28:08.870 --> 02:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
we are
 
02:28:11.190 --> 02:28:11.200 align:start position:0%
limited in our staff there may be times
 
02:28:12.070 --> 02:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
i don't expect
 
02:28:13.429 --> 02:28:13.439 align:start position:0%
it at this moment but there may be a
 
02:28:15.510 --> 02:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
time when i can't make a meeting that
 
02:28:17.190 --> 02:28:17.200 align:start position:0%
you have because i'm double or triple
 
02:28:18.070 --> 02:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
booked because of
 
02:28:20.309 --> 02:28:20.319 align:start position:0%
other meetings i might need to attend we
 
02:28:21.990 --> 02:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
may send somebody else from our office
 
02:28:23.750 --> 02:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
just to represent us and to help the
 
02:28:25.190 --> 02:28:25.200 align:start position:0%
committee get through whatever work they
 
02:28:28.230 --> 02:28:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:30.150 --> 02:28:30.160 align:start position:0%
and then once the house is done with its
 
02:28:32.309 --> 02:28:32.319 align:start position:0%
process and votes the capital budget out
 
02:28:34.389 --> 02:28:34.399 align:start position:0%
it goes over to the senate
 
02:28:35.910 --> 02:28:35.920 align:start position:0%
they go through a similar process where
 
02:28:37.910 --> 02:28:37.920 align:start position:0%
they work on it typically
 
02:28:41.030 --> 02:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
the capital budget is house bill 25
 
02:28:43.590 --> 02:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
um so that is is an easy way if you ever
 
02:28:44.389 --> 02:28:44.399 align:start position:0%
want to search
 
02:28:47.190 --> 02:28:47.200 align:start position:0%
going backwards in in the um bills if
 
02:28:49.110 --> 02:28:49.120 align:start position:0%
you look for previous house bill 25s
 
02:28:49.990 --> 02:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
they typically are
 
02:28:51.590 --> 02:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
your capital budget so you can see you
 
02:28:53.110 --> 02:28:53.120 align:start position:0%
know what the capital budget was from
 
02:28:53.120 --> 02:28:53.990 align:start position:0%
know what the capital budget was from
2019

02:28:53.990 --> 02:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
2019
 
02:28:57.429 --> 02:28:57.439 align:start position:0%
or 2017 um you know 200
 
02:29:00.630 --> 02:29:00.640 align:start position:0%
2005. you could go back and pick them in
 
02:29:02.630 --> 02:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
that way
 
02:29:04.469 --> 02:29:04.479 align:start position:0%
once the senate completes its process
 
02:29:06.309 --> 02:29:06.319 align:start position:0%
they'll vote
 
02:29:08.389 --> 02:29:08.399 align:start position:0%
they'll vote out their capital budget
 
02:29:11.190 --> 02:29:11.200 align:start position:0%
and if it's anything like the last time
 
02:29:12.710 --> 02:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
there'll be agreement already between
 
02:29:14.710 --> 02:29:14.720 align:start position:0%
the two committees on what was um
 
02:29:16.550 --> 02:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
changed by the senate and
 
02:29:18.150 --> 02:29:18.160 align:start position:0%
you'll you would not have to go to a
 
02:29:19.750 --> 02:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
committee a conference
 
02:29:21.990 --> 02:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
but that is the last step that the
 
02:29:23.590 --> 02:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
legislature would take as a committee
 
02:29:25.830 --> 02:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
conference and typically with the
 
02:29:28.469 --> 02:29:28.479 align:start position:0%
capital budget the reason you have a
 
02:29:29.590 --> 02:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
committee a conference
 
02:29:32.710 --> 02:29:32.720 align:start position:0%
um isn't so much to that you're in total
 
02:29:34.150 --> 02:29:34.160 align:start position:0%
disagreement on what was
 
02:29:36.389 --> 02:29:36.399 align:start position:0%
done by the senate it's more to make
 
02:29:38.710 --> 02:29:38.720 align:start position:0%
sure that nothing is in error
 
02:29:40.389 --> 02:29:40.399 align:start position:0%
and to give you kind of one last chance
 
02:29:41.910 --> 02:29:41.920 align:start position:0%
to say okay are we all good with what's
 
02:29:43.190 --> 02:29:43.200 align:start position:0%
in this capital budget
 
02:29:46.389 --> 02:29:46.399 align:start position:0%
we're okay to let it go um
 
02:29:48.469 --> 02:29:48.479 align:start position:0%
i there was limited changes between the
 
02:29:50.309 --> 02:29:50.319 align:start position:0%
house and the senate this last time so i
 
02:29:51.270 --> 02:29:51.280 align:start position:0%
think that that
 
02:29:54.550 --> 02:29:54.560 align:start position:0%
helped eliminate the need for a
 
02:29:55.830 --> 02:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
committee a conference for that
 
02:29:57.590 --> 02:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
particular budget
 
02:29:58.950 --> 02:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
and then hopefully the governor would
 
02:30:00.550 --> 02:30:00.560 align:start position:0%
sign anything that the legislature
 
02:30:00.560 --> 02:30:01.270 align:start position:0%
sign anything that the legislature
adopts

02:30:01.270 --> 02:30:01.280 align:start position:0%
adopts
 
02:30:03.510 --> 02:30:03.520 align:start position:0%
by the end of june and then that capital
 
02:30:04.870 --> 02:30:04.880 align:start position:0%
budget would take effect so that's
 
02:30:06.389 --> 02:30:06.399 align:start position:0%
essentially what this page is showing
 
02:30:06.399 --> 02:30:08.790 align:start position:0%
essentially what this page is showing
you

02:30:08.790 --> 02:30:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:11.110 --> 02:30:11.120 align:start position:0%
and here is just a a picture of the
 
02:30:14.710 --> 02:30:14.720 align:start position:0%
docket for the capital budget in 2019
 
02:30:17.910 --> 02:30:17.920 align:start position:0%
you can see that the committee starting
 
02:30:19.429 --> 02:30:19.439 align:start position:0%
on the 6th of
 
02:30:23.349 --> 02:30:23.359 align:start position:0%
march had a number of uh work sessions
 
02:30:26.230 --> 02:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
some of these would may have been um
 
02:30:28.150 --> 02:30:28.160 align:start position:0%
with agencies some of them may not have
 
02:30:29.750 --> 02:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
had agencies in there
 
02:30:31.110 --> 02:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
depending on where you were in the
 
02:30:33.750 --> 02:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
process but we again we will help you
 
02:30:35.349 --> 02:30:35.359 align:start position:0%
schedule the agencies you need to have
 
02:30:35.359 --> 02:30:35.910 align:start position:0%
schedule the agencies you need to have
in

02:30:35.910 --> 02:30:35.920 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:30:37.349 --> 02:30:37.359 align:start position:0%
and how many times you need to have them
 
02:30:40.389 --> 02:30:40.399 align:start position:0%
in so you may talk to someone initially
 
02:30:42.150 --> 02:30:42.160 align:start position:0%
about their capital projects and you may
 
02:30:43.429 --> 02:30:43.439 align:start position:0%
need to bring them back in
 
02:30:45.830 --> 02:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
to further flush out what's going on
 
02:30:46.950 --> 02:30:46.960 align:start position:0%
with it
 
02:30:48.389 --> 02:30:48.399 align:start position:0%
or if there were questions after the
 
02:30:48.399 --> 02:30:51.750 align:start position:0%
or if there were questions after the
fact

02:30:51.750 --> 02:30:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:54.790 --> 02:30:54.800 align:start position:0%
so one of the services or one of the
 
02:30:56.790 --> 02:30:56.800 align:start position:0%
things that our office will do
 
02:30:59.349 --> 02:30:59.359 align:start position:0%
is provide you a we call it a compare
 
02:30:59.359 --> 02:31:00.550 align:start position:0%
is provide you a we call it a compare
report

02:31:00.550 --> 02:31:00.560 align:start position:0%
report
 
02:31:04.150 --> 02:31:04.160 align:start position:0%
so you can see column c that's the
 
02:31:07.830 --> 02:31:07.840 align:start position:0%
governor and what he had
 
02:31:10.469 --> 02:31:10.479 align:start position:0%
he had proposed for his capital budget
 
02:31:12.469 --> 02:31:12.479 align:start position:0%
and it's structured by agency and the
 
02:31:14.710 --> 02:31:14.720 align:start position:0%
name of the capital project
 
02:31:18.150 --> 02:31:18.160 align:start position:0%
and then how it's funded is in column b
 
02:31:21.030 --> 02:31:21.040 align:start position:0%
so f obviously is federal fund bg would
 
02:31:23.590 --> 02:31:23.600 align:start position:0%
be your general fund bonds
 
02:31:26.870 --> 02:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
and then there's a bo with your bonds
 
02:31:28.950 --> 02:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
others so agencies such as liquor
 
02:31:35.990 --> 02:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:39.190 --> 02:31:39.200 align:start position:0%
former dread so escaping me their title
 
02:31:40.550 --> 02:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
right uh
 
02:31:41.830 --> 02:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
department of natural and cultural
 
02:31:43.990 --> 02:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
resources so they may have other funding
 
02:31:44.630 --> 02:31:44.640 align:start position:0%
sources that
 
02:31:46.630 --> 02:31:46.640 align:start position:0%
that are used to take care of projects
 
02:31:48.070 --> 02:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
such as the park fund
 
02:31:50.469 --> 02:31:50.479 align:start position:0%
um and you'll see them as bond other and
 
02:31:52.230 --> 02:31:52.240 align:start position:0%
then you also have highway funds which
 
02:31:55.990 --> 02:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
would be at the end of this
 
02:31:59.110 --> 02:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
we would update this at each phase and
 
02:32:00.150 --> 02:32:00.160 align:start position:0%
where there was no committee a
 
02:32:02.389 --> 02:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
conference there isn't a column f but
 
02:32:03.750 --> 02:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
we would typically have a committee a
 
02:32:05.190 --> 02:32:05.200 align:start position:0%
conference column to show you what the
 
02:32:07.349 --> 02:32:07.359 align:start position:0%
final negotiations were
 
02:32:09.349 --> 02:32:09.359 align:start position:0%
in this case the senate capital budget
 
02:32:10.870 --> 02:32:10.880 align:start position:0%
which was adopted by the senate was
 
02:32:10.880 --> 02:32:11.349 align:start position:0%
which was adopted by the senate was
really

02:32:11.349 --> 02:32:11.359 align:start position:0%
really
 
02:32:14.070 --> 02:32:14.080 align:start position:0%
the last change in this particular
 
02:32:14.080 --> 02:32:15.349 align:start position:0%
the last change in this particular
document

02:32:15.349 --> 02:32:15.359 align:start position:0%
document
 
02:32:18.150 --> 02:32:18.160 align:start position:0%
the grayed out rows are the changes that
 
02:32:19.910 --> 02:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
occurred in the senate
 
02:32:21.750 --> 02:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
from the house and in some cases it was
 
02:32:23.590 --> 02:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
just a note that was added in other
 
02:32:26.070 --> 02:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
cases it was the value
 
02:32:28.950 --> 02:32:28.960 align:start position:0%
and this document typically runs 10 15
 
02:32:28.960 --> 02:32:31.750 align:start position:0%
and this document typically runs 10 15
pages

02:32:31.750 --> 02:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:34.950 --> 02:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:37.830 --> 02:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
so typically your house bill two house
 
02:32:38.950 --> 02:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
bill 25
 
02:32:40.550 --> 02:32:40.560 align:start position:0%
will be divided into sections and the
 
02:32:42.389 --> 02:32:42.399 align:start position:0%
highway funds will be separated out from
 
02:32:43.990 --> 02:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
the general funds
 
02:32:45.830 --> 02:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
um and that's what you're seeing here
 
02:32:47.750 --> 02:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
section two
 
02:32:48.950 --> 02:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
is the department of safety and
 
02:32:50.309 --> 02:32:50.319 align:start position:0%
department of transportation where
 
02:32:51.670 --> 02:32:51.680 align:start position:0%
they're showing you their highway funds
 
02:32:53.670 --> 02:32:53.680 align:start position:0%
that they would like to bond
 
02:32:56.630 --> 02:32:56.640 align:start position:0%
there are some um for for example
 
02:32:58.150 --> 02:32:58.160 align:start position:0%
department of safety
 
02:32:59.990 --> 02:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
may have general funds matching highway
 
02:33:01.349 --> 02:33:01.359 align:start position:0%
funds to take care of something so they
 
02:33:04.230 --> 02:33:04.240 align:start position:0%
may have a project split between the two
 
02:33:07.349 --> 02:33:07.359 align:start position:0%
and um i think if i go up you'll see
 
02:33:07.359 --> 02:33:08.790 align:start position:0%
and um i think if i go up you'll see
that

02:33:08.790 --> 02:33:08.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:33:12.150 --> 02:33:12.160 align:start position:0%
troop c renovation is in both places
 
02:33:13.750 --> 02:33:13.760 align:start position:0%
it's because there's there's money from
 
02:33:13.760 --> 02:33:14.550 align:start position:0%
it's because there's there's money from
both

02:33:14.550 --> 02:33:14.560 align:start position:0%
both
 
02:33:16.230 --> 02:33:16.240 align:start position:0%
types of funds being used to pay for
 
02:33:19.190 --> 02:33:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:21.429 --> 02:33:21.439 align:start position:0%
and then on the bottom of the um
 
02:33:23.270 --> 02:33:23.280 align:start position:0%
document you'll find the totals as it
 
02:33:24.150 --> 02:33:24.160 align:start position:0%
relates to
 
02:33:28.070 --> 02:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:30.389 --> 02:33:30.399 align:start position:0%
then you'll find the totals for the into
 
02:33:32.389 --> 02:33:32.399 align:start position:0%
the entire capital budget
 
02:33:35.910 --> 02:33:35.920 align:start position:0%
and the number that tends to be the one
 
02:33:35.920 --> 02:33:36.309 align:start position:0%
and the number that tends to be the one
that

02:33:36.309 --> 02:33:36.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:33:38.630 --> 02:33:38.640 align:start position:0%
is generally focused on is the total
 
02:33:38.640 --> 02:33:39.349 align:start position:0%
is generally focused on is the total
bonds

02:33:39.349 --> 02:33:39.359 align:start position:0%
bonds
 
02:33:42.630 --> 02:33:42.640 align:start position:0%
um funded with general funds
 
02:33:45.830 --> 02:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
so here we ended up just under 125
 
02:33:45.840 --> 02:33:47.110 align:start position:0%
so here we ended up just under 125
million

02:33:47.110 --> 02:33:47.120 align:start position:0%
million
 
02:33:49.750 --> 02:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
the governor based on the debt
 
02:33:51.830 --> 02:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
affordability information provided by
 
02:33:53.190 --> 02:33:53.200 align:start position:0%
the treasurer who i believe you're going
 
02:33:54.389 --> 02:33:54.399 align:start position:0%
to be hearing from
 
02:33:57.110 --> 02:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
after me will come up with a a number
 
02:33:58.150 --> 02:33:58.160 align:start position:0%
that they believe is
 
02:34:01.590 --> 02:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
a good number during that 2019 capital
 
02:34:04.469 --> 02:34:04.479 align:start position:0%
budget they started 120 million
 
02:34:07.190 --> 02:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
the committee felt comfortable um after
 
02:34:08.550 --> 02:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
talking with the treasurer and looking
 
02:34:09.910 --> 02:34:09.920 align:start position:0%
at the number of projects that were out
 
02:34:10.790 --> 02:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
there to
 
02:34:13.270 --> 02:34:13.280 align:start position:0%
move closer to 125 million by the time
 
02:34:18.150 --> 02:34:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:19.990 --> 02:34:20.000 align:start position:0%
so that that's the compare document and
 
02:34:21.270 --> 02:34:21.280 align:start position:0%
then the next document
 
02:34:23.429 --> 02:34:23.439 align:start position:0%
in the in the uh presentation is the
 
02:34:26.309 --> 02:34:26.319 align:start position:0%
actual capital budget for 2019.
 
02:34:27.910 --> 02:34:27.920 align:start position:0%
so this is the the current capital
 
02:34:29.590 --> 02:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
budget that we're involved with
 
02:34:31.750 --> 02:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
i included in the document just as a
 
02:34:33.270 --> 02:34:33.280 align:start position:0%
kind of a one-placed
 
02:34:35.190 --> 02:34:35.200 align:start position:0%
uh resource if you happen to look at
 
02:34:36.790 --> 02:34:36.800 align:start position:0%
you're wondering what ended up happening
 
02:34:40.230 --> 02:34:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:43.670 --> 02:34:43.680 align:start position:0%
and as i mentioned there'll be
 
02:34:45.349 --> 02:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
multiple sections for the capital budget
 
02:34:47.110 --> 02:34:47.120 align:start position:0%
section one will typically be all those
 
02:34:48.550 --> 02:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
projects that are going to be funded
 
02:34:51.830 --> 02:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
through general fund um bonding
 
02:34:54.950 --> 02:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
and then you can see by agency you know
 
02:34:56.790 --> 02:34:56.800 align:start position:0%
how busy it is but you see how
 
02:34:58.150 --> 02:34:58.160 align:start position:0%
what what the projects are and how
 
02:35:00.950 --> 02:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
they're being funded
 
02:35:03.910 --> 02:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
but what also is in the house bill 25
 
02:35:03.920 --> 02:35:04.550 align:start position:0%
but what also is in the house bill 25
are

02:35:04.550 --> 02:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:35:07.910 --> 02:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
other sections that help make this work
 
02:35:12.710 --> 02:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
so i'm just gonna scroll down
 
02:35:14.469 --> 02:35:14.479 align:start position:0%
so obviously there's footnotes in here
 
02:35:15.830 --> 02:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
and sometimes um
 
02:35:18.150 --> 02:35:18.160 align:start position:0%
that's just to designate that the
 
02:35:19.030 --> 02:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
funding source
 
02:35:21.190 --> 02:35:21.200 align:start position:0%
is when it's another funding source what
 
02:35:23.110 --> 02:35:23.120 align:start position:0%
that funding source is
 
02:35:24.870 --> 02:35:24.880 align:start position:0%
so that there's no confusion other times
 
02:35:26.950 --> 02:35:26.960 align:start position:0%
there may be direction on
 
02:35:28.710 --> 02:35:28.720 align:start position:0%
for instance if you're buying a vehicle
 
02:35:30.389 --> 02:35:30.399 align:start position:0%
you don't want it to be bonded for 20
 
02:35:32.550 --> 02:35:32.560 align:start position:0%
years the the committee would prefer it
 
02:35:34.870 --> 02:35:34.880 align:start position:0%
be bonded for only 10 years there may be
 
02:35:36.230 --> 02:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
direction included in
 
02:35:40.710 --> 02:35:40.720 align:start position:0%
the footnote around that appropriation
 
02:35:43.110 --> 02:35:43.120 align:start position:0%
so as i go so right now it's that we're
 
02:35:44.790 --> 02:35:44.800 align:start position:0%
seven pages into it we're still looking
 
02:35:46.150 --> 02:35:46.160 align:start position:0%
at the appropriations
 
02:35:48.630 --> 02:35:48.640 align:start position:0%
this is we're through the highway fund
 
02:35:51.110 --> 02:35:51.120 align:start position:0%
the university system
 
02:35:54.790 --> 02:35:54.800 align:start position:0%
um this this current capital budget the
 
02:35:57.830 --> 02:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
the 2021 capital budget um
 
02:36:01.110 --> 02:36:01.120 align:start position:0%
established uh appropriations over the
 
02:36:01.120 --> 02:36:02.309 align:start position:0%
established uh appropriations over the
next

02:36:02.309 --> 02:36:02.319 align:start position:0%
next
 
02:36:06.150 --> 02:36:06.160 align:start position:0%
three biennium and the first was for
 
02:36:08.150 --> 02:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
the focus on the spalding hall which i
 
02:36:10.389 --> 02:36:10.399 align:start position:0%
believe is their science building
 
02:36:12.950 --> 02:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
and then they have hyde hall and then
 
02:36:14.790 --> 02:36:14.800 align:start position:0%
the um student centers
 
02:36:17.990 --> 02:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
and what they've asked for is 10 million
 
02:36:21.910 --> 02:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
in 2021 which the is the current budget
 
02:36:23.830 --> 02:36:23.840 align:start position:0%
then they would ask for an additional 15
 
02:36:23.840 --> 02:36:24.950 align:start position:0%
then they would ask for an additional 15
million

02:36:24.950 --> 02:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
million
 
02:36:28.309 --> 02:36:28.319 align:start position:0%
in the 2223 and then
 
02:36:32.230 --> 02:36:32.240 align:start position:0%
an additional 17 in the 2425 capital
 
02:36:32.240 --> 02:36:33.190 align:start position:0%
an additional 17 in the 2425 capital
budget

02:36:33.190 --> 02:36:33.200 align:start position:0%
budget
 
02:36:35.349 --> 02:36:35.359 align:start position:0%
those appropriations have been made in
 
02:36:37.910 --> 02:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
the 2019 capital budget so as of right
 
02:36:37.920 --> 02:36:38.870 align:start position:0%
the 2019 capital budget so as of right
now

02:36:38.870 --> 02:36:38.880 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:36:42.870 --> 02:36:42.880 align:start position:0%
um the treasury would allow
 
02:36:45.349 --> 02:36:45.359 align:start position:0%
the university system to ask for these
 
02:36:46.630 --> 02:36:46.640 align:start position:0%
amounts to be bonded
 
02:36:48.950 --> 02:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
during those time frames so unless
 
02:36:51.910 --> 02:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
there's a change to the statute
 
02:36:54.550 --> 02:36:54.560 align:start position:0%
or this chapter law these authorities
 
02:36:58.710 --> 02:36:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:01.910 --> 02:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
so other things that go on
 
02:37:04.389 --> 02:37:04.399 align:start position:0%
there's some boilerplate type language
 
02:37:05.270 --> 02:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
in the in the
 
02:37:07.510 --> 02:37:07.520 align:start position:0%
in the bill like land accuracy
 
02:37:07.520 --> 02:37:08.710 align:start position:0%
in the bill like land accuracy
acquisition

02:37:08.710 --> 02:37:08.720 align:start position:0%
acquisition
 
02:37:11.110 --> 02:37:11.120 align:start position:0%
um there's a boilerplate that's in every
 
02:37:14.950 --> 02:37:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:17.830 --> 02:37:17.840 align:start position:0%
section on page nine here bonds
 
02:37:17.840 --> 02:37:18.469 align:start position:0%
section on page nine here bonds
authorized

02:37:18.469 --> 02:37:18.479 align:start position:0%
authorized
 
02:37:20.630 --> 02:37:20.640 align:start position:0%
this is actually the appropriation that
 
02:37:22.950 --> 02:37:22.960 align:start position:0%
the treasury will look at
 
02:37:24.950 --> 02:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
and says this is the authority that's
 
02:37:26.550 --> 02:37:26.560 align:start position:0%
provided to us to actually go out and
 
02:37:26.560 --> 02:37:27.429 align:start position:0%
provided to us to actually go out and
bond

02:37:27.429 --> 02:37:27.439 align:start position:0%
bond
 
02:37:29.590 --> 02:37:29.600 align:start position:0%
the dollars that have been appropriated
 
02:37:32.309 --> 02:37:32.319 align:start position:0%
in this capital budget there's
 
02:37:37.910 --> 02:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:40.469 --> 02:37:40.479 align:start position:0%
the capital budget overview so it's a
 
02:37:40.479 --> 02:37:41.190 align:start position:0%
the capital budget overview so it's a
section

02:37:41.190 --> 02:37:41.200 align:start position:0%
section
 
02:37:45.349 --> 02:37:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:49.670 --> 02:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
so during this uh 2021 capital budget
 
02:37:52.230 --> 02:37:52.240 align:start position:0%
if an agency was we'll just say it's
 
02:37:53.510 --> 02:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
administrative services and they're
 
02:37:54.389 --> 02:37:54.399 align:start position:0%
trying to do a
 
02:37:57.670 --> 02:37:57.680 align:start position:0%
a roof replacement on a building
 
02:37:59.750 --> 02:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
and they've completed another project
 
02:38:01.510 --> 02:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
that is in this capital
 
02:38:04.630 --> 02:38:04.640 align:start position:0%
budget and they have money left over and
 
02:38:06.150 --> 02:38:06.160 align:start position:0%
it could be used to help get the roof
 
02:38:07.510 --> 02:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
done because there wasn't enough
 
02:38:09.830 --> 02:38:09.840 align:start position:0%
appropriated at the time they can come
 
02:38:11.349 --> 02:38:11.359 align:start position:0%
into the capital budget overview
 
02:38:11.359 --> 02:38:11.910 align:start position:0%
into the capital budget overview
committee

02:38:11.910 --> 02:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:38:14.550 --> 02:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
and ask that that money be allowed to be
 
02:38:16.150 --> 02:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
transferred into the
 
02:38:18.710 --> 02:38:18.720 align:start position:0%
the roof appropriation for the capitol
 
02:38:18.720 --> 02:38:19.830 align:start position:0%
the roof appropriation for the capitol
building

02:38:19.830 --> 02:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
building
 
02:38:21.590 --> 02:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
and and that way that project could get
 
02:38:23.510 --> 02:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
done and and the theory or the idea
 
02:38:24.630 --> 02:38:24.640 align:start position:0%
behind that is
 
02:38:27.510 --> 02:38:27.520 align:start position:0%
the legislature intended for 124 million
 
02:38:29.270 --> 02:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
or almost 125 million dollars
 
02:38:32.550 --> 02:38:32.560 align:start position:0%
wanting to occur for the capital budgets
 
02:38:34.150 --> 02:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
uh capital projects that are listed in
 
02:38:36.150 --> 02:38:36.160 align:start position:0%
that capital budget
 
02:38:39.030 --> 02:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
knowing that they're typically 18 months
 
02:38:39.830 --> 02:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
out before
 
02:38:41.990 --> 02:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
some of these projects really get going
 
02:38:43.670 --> 02:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
some of the costs associated with them
 
02:38:45.030 --> 02:38:45.040 align:start position:0%
may change
 
02:38:48.309 --> 02:38:48.319 align:start position:0%
so they either go up in most cases
 
02:38:51.510 --> 02:38:51.520 align:start position:0%
or maybe the issue wasn't as bad as
 
02:38:53.590 --> 02:38:53.600 align:start position:0%
intended as it initially thought so the
 
02:38:55.270 --> 02:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
agency didn't have to spend as much
 
02:38:55.280 --> 02:38:55.990 align:start position:0%
agency didn't have to spend as much
money

02:38:55.990 --> 02:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
money
 
02:38:58.070 --> 02:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
so this just allows for for the use of
 
02:38:59.990 --> 02:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
the bonding authority to actually get
 
02:39:03.190 --> 02:39:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:04.790 --> 02:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
but again it's not something that the
 
02:39:06.469 --> 02:39:06.479 align:start position:0%
agencies can do without permission from
 
02:39:08.070 --> 02:39:08.080 align:start position:0%
the legislature they do come back to the
 
02:39:12.790 --> 02:39:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:15.429 --> 02:39:15.439 align:start position:0%
and then i think um representative
 
02:39:17.429 --> 02:39:17.439 align:start position:0%
graham's favorite part is section
 
02:39:21.750 --> 02:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
14 and these are the
 
02:39:28.150 --> 02:39:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:30.309 --> 02:39:30.319 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry there were some other things
 
02:39:32.070 --> 02:39:32.080 align:start position:0%
that occurred with appropriations
 
02:39:36.950 --> 02:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
in the 19 budget where the committee
 
02:39:39.910 --> 02:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
forced to lapse on some um projects and
 
02:39:42.389 --> 02:39:42.399 align:start position:0%
then repurpose those funds for other
 
02:39:45.990 --> 02:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
purposes but um
 
02:39:48.309 --> 02:39:48.319 align:start position:0%
section 20 is the is the section i was
 
02:39:49.990 --> 02:39:50.000 align:start position:0%
referencing for represent graham
 
02:39:52.070 --> 02:39:52.080 align:start position:0%
and that's the lapse extended for
 
02:39:55.349 --> 02:39:55.359 align:start position:0%
projects in previous capital budgets
 
02:39:58.630 --> 02:39:58.640 align:start position:0%
that's there's about 160 projects in the
 
02:40:01.670 --> 02:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
2019 house bill 25 that had their
 
02:40:05.349 --> 02:40:05.359 align:start position:0%
appropriations extended
 
02:40:07.429 --> 02:40:07.439 align:start position:0%
when you see the next capital budget and
 
02:40:09.110 --> 02:40:09.120 align:start position:0%
for 2223
 
02:40:11.110 --> 02:40:11.120 align:start position:0%
there's going to be some similar number
 
02:40:13.030 --> 02:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
of projects that um
 
02:40:15.110 --> 02:40:15.120 align:start position:0%
will also be requested to extend their
 
02:40:15.120 --> 02:40:16.389 align:start position:0%
will also be requested to extend their
appropriations

02:40:16.389 --> 02:40:16.399 align:start position:0%
appropriations
 
02:40:18.230 --> 02:40:18.240 align:start position:0%
and there's a variety of reasons for
 
02:40:18.240 --> 02:40:19.510 align:start position:0%
and there's a variety of reasons for
that

02:40:19.510 --> 02:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:40:21.750 --> 02:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes projects get delayed um you
 
02:40:21.760 --> 02:40:22.950 align:start position:0%
sometimes projects get delayed um you
know

02:40:22.950 --> 02:40:22.960 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:40:25.429 --> 02:40:25.439 align:start position:0%
the the design factor you know they
 
02:40:27.429 --> 02:40:27.439 align:start position:0%
couldn't get that done in time to
 
02:40:30.150 --> 02:40:30.160 align:start position:0%
meet the requirements to have a project
 
02:40:30.160 --> 02:40:30.630 align:start position:0%
meet the requirements to have a project
start

02:40:30.630 --> 02:40:30.640 align:start position:0%
start
 
02:40:32.309 --> 02:40:32.319 align:start position:0%
when they originally thought so they're
 
02:40:36.870 --> 02:40:36.880 align:start position:0%
like okay we can get it done in 2021
 
02:40:39.510 --> 02:40:39.520 align:start position:0%
but we can't complete it until 2022 and
 
02:40:39.520 --> 02:40:39.910 align:start position:0%
but we can't complete it until 2022 and
there's

02:40:39.910 --> 02:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
there's
 
02:40:41.670 --> 02:40:41.680 align:start position:0%
some pieces that we would need to have
 
02:40:44.630 --> 02:40:44.640 align:start position:0%
the funding available for
 
02:40:46.550 --> 02:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
so what the committee has done in the
 
02:40:48.389 --> 02:40:48.399 align:start position:0%
past is to go through and ask the
 
02:40:50.630 --> 02:40:50.640 align:start position:0%
agencies to come in and talk about the
 
02:40:52.389 --> 02:40:52.399 align:start position:0%
projects they want to extend the lapses
 
02:40:52.399 --> 02:40:54.550 align:start position:0%
projects they want to extend the lapses
for

02:40:54.550 --> 02:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:40:55.830 --> 02:40:55.840 align:start position:0%
just to make sure the committee
 
02:40:57.910 --> 02:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
understands why that's occurring
 
02:41:00.230 --> 02:41:00.240 align:start position:0%
and agrees with that but it also gives
 
02:41:02.309 --> 02:41:02.319 align:start position:0%
the agencies a kind of a
 
02:41:04.230 --> 02:41:04.240 align:start position:0%
second bite at the apple in case they
 
02:41:05.750 --> 02:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
missed a project that they needed to
 
02:41:05.760 --> 02:41:06.710 align:start position:0%
missed a project that they needed to
extend

02:41:06.710 --> 02:41:06.720 align:start position:0%
extend
 
02:41:08.309 --> 02:41:08.319 align:start position:0%
or they added one that they actually got
 
02:41:09.670 --> 02:41:09.680 align:start position:0%
done sooner than they thought and they
 
02:41:11.349 --> 02:41:11.359 align:start position:0%
really don't need it to be extended
 
02:41:14.309 --> 02:41:14.319 align:start position:0%
so then it could be closed out and and
 
02:41:15.510 --> 02:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
that's a
 
02:41:22.870 --> 02:41:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:25.990 --> 02:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
so so again that's the bill
 
02:41:28.630 --> 02:41:28.640 align:start position:0%
and that's get you through what the
 
02:41:29.990 --> 02:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
current capital budget is
 
02:41:31.910 --> 02:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
this next page page 41 of the
 
02:41:31.920 --> 02:41:33.830 align:start position:0%
this next page page 41 of the
presentation

02:41:33.830 --> 02:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
02:41:36.469 --> 02:41:36.479 align:start position:0%
is it the summary pages from the
 
02:41:39.190 --> 02:41:39.200 align:start position:0%
requests made by agencies
 
02:41:40.710 --> 02:41:40.720 align:start position:0%
at the governor's capital budget
 
02:41:43.269 --> 02:41:43.279 align:start position:0%
hearings in june so this first page is a
 
02:41:44.150 --> 02:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
summary page
 
02:41:45.750 --> 02:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
so it just has the all the agencies
 
02:41:45.760 --> 02:41:47.830 align:start position:0%
so it just has the all the agencies
listed

02:41:47.830 --> 02:41:47.840 align:start position:0%
listed
 
02:41:51.190 --> 02:41:51.200 align:start position:0%
and across the top it has various
 
02:41:52.070 --> 02:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
aspects of
 
02:41:54.309 --> 02:41:54.319 align:start position:0%
of a project you know are they acquiring
 
02:41:54.319 --> 02:41:55.269 align:start position:0%
of a project you know are they acquiring
land

02:41:55.269 --> 02:41:55.279 align:start position:0%
land
 
02:41:58.389 --> 02:41:58.399 align:start position:0%
um the construction you know engineering
 
02:42:01.429 --> 02:42:01.439 align:start position:0%
and architectural work is it a computer
 
02:42:03.190 --> 02:42:03.200 align:start position:0%
other equipment they might need so they
 
02:42:04.790 --> 02:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
list it out across the top and they give
 
02:42:05.910 --> 02:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
you a value
 
02:42:07.750 --> 02:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunately what this document doesn't
 
02:42:08.950 --> 02:42:08.960 align:start position:0%
show you
 
02:42:10.830 --> 02:42:10.840 align:start position:0%
is what the funding source is at this
 
02:42:10.840 --> 02:42:12.389 align:start position:0%
is what the funding source is at this
time

02:42:12.389 --> 02:42:12.399 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:42:14.230 --> 02:42:14.240 align:start position:0%
and then as you go down to the next page
 
02:42:15.830 --> 02:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
it then breaks it out by
 
02:42:18.070 --> 02:42:18.080 align:start position:0%
agency and the projects that they wanted
 
02:42:20.150 --> 02:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
to fund in this case
 
02:42:23.429 --> 02:42:23.439 align:start position:0%
this is doit and they're looking to fund
 
02:42:23.439 --> 02:42:24.309 align:start position:0%
this is doit and they're looking to fund
several

02:42:24.309 --> 02:42:24.319 align:start position:0%
several
 
02:42:27.269 --> 02:42:27.279 align:start position:0%
computer projects some of these are are
 
02:42:27.279 --> 02:42:28.070 align:start position:0%
computer projects some of these are are
familiar

02:42:28.070 --> 02:42:28.080 align:start position:0%
familiar
 
02:42:30.630 --> 02:42:30.640 align:start position:0%
to cyber security it's something that
 
02:42:30.640 --> 02:42:31.110 align:start position:0%
to cyber security it's something that
they've

02:42:31.110 --> 02:42:31.120 align:start position:0%
they've
 
02:42:32.469 --> 02:42:32.479 align:start position:0%
asked about i think the last two or
 
02:42:33.990 --> 02:42:34.000 align:start position:0%
three capital budgets and have gotten
 
02:42:35.030 --> 02:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
some funding
 
02:42:40.790 --> 02:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
to do that i think um you tend to see
 
02:42:42.150 --> 02:42:42.160 align:start position:0%
more and more
 
02:42:45.510 --> 02:42:45.520 align:start position:0%
um computer or
 
02:42:47.670 --> 02:42:47.680 align:start position:0%
i.t related projects in the capital
 
02:42:48.950 --> 02:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
budget because
 
02:42:51.750 --> 02:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of them are costly um and so
 
02:42:53.030 --> 02:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
that's where they've been instructed to
 
02:42:54.630 --> 02:42:54.640 align:start position:0%
put them
 
02:42:56.710 --> 02:42:56.720 align:start position:0%
years and years and years ago some of
 
02:42:58.469 --> 02:42:58.479 align:start position:0%
these projects tended to be done through
 
02:42:59.910 --> 02:42:59.920 align:start position:0%
the operating budget or through other
 
02:42:59.920 --> 02:43:01.190 align:start position:0%
the operating budget or through other
mechanisms

02:43:01.190 --> 02:43:01.200 align:start position:0%
mechanisms
 
02:43:02.870 --> 02:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
so now you have this issue of these
 
02:43:04.790 --> 02:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
these computer projects
 
02:43:06.790 --> 02:43:06.800 align:start position:0%
competing with your what i would call
 
02:43:07.990 --> 02:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
your traditional capital
 
02:43:09.830 --> 02:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
projects the buildings and and the
 
02:43:11.349 --> 02:43:11.359 align:start position:0%
maintenance of buildings
 
02:43:13.349 --> 02:43:13.359 align:start position:0%
and that's something that um you you as
 
02:43:14.950 --> 02:43:14.960 align:start position:0%
members of the committee will have to
 
02:43:17.190 --> 02:43:17.200 align:start position:0%
kind of decide you know how much can you
 
02:43:17.200 --> 02:43:18.469 align:start position:0%
kind of decide you know how much can you
afford

02:43:18.469 --> 02:43:18.479 align:start position:0%
afford
 
02:43:21.830 --> 02:43:21.840 align:start position:0%
to give agencies to do their their
 
02:43:24.070 --> 02:43:24.080 align:start position:0%
computer type project their it-related
 
02:43:25.429 --> 02:43:25.439 align:start position:0%
projects versus
 
02:43:32.070 --> 02:43:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:34.550 --> 02:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
administrative services it will be the
 
02:43:37.269 --> 02:43:37.279 align:start position:0%
largest um agency with
 
02:43:39.110 --> 02:43:39.120 align:start position:0%
projects again because they're the
 
02:43:40.870 --> 02:43:40.880 align:start position:0%
central agency for the state they can't
 
02:43:43.269 --> 02:43:43.279 align:start position:0%
they run most of the projects
 
02:43:46.070 --> 02:43:46.080 align:start position:0%
um so they will um and they manage most
 
02:43:47.349 --> 02:43:47.359 align:start position:0%
of the buildings and so that's what
 
02:43:48.710 --> 02:43:48.720 align:start position:0%
their projects relate to
 
02:43:52.070 --> 02:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:54.550 --> 02:43:54.560 align:start position:0%
when you have the opportunity to look at
 
02:43:56.630 --> 02:43:56.640 align:start position:0%
the capital improvement program book
 
02:43:58.070 --> 02:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
it does break out administrative
 
02:43:59.910 --> 02:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
services into components so you can kind
 
02:44:01.349 --> 02:44:01.359 align:start position:0%
of see oh this is for the buildings this
 
02:44:02.710 --> 02:44:02.720 align:start position:0%
is for the courts
 
02:44:05.429 --> 02:44:05.439 align:start position:0%
this is for um their i.t the what's
 
02:44:06.309 --> 02:44:06.319 align:start position:0%
called fdm
 
02:44:07.910 --> 02:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
for their accounting for the comptroller
 
02:44:10.309 --> 02:44:10.319 align:start position:0%
and and for the state
 
02:44:12.870 --> 02:44:12.880 align:start position:0%
um so again this is just to give you
 
02:44:15.030 --> 02:44:15.040 align:start position:0%
some some reference or some guide as to
 
02:44:16.870 --> 02:44:16.880 align:start position:0%
you know what agencies originally asked
 
02:44:16.880 --> 02:44:17.510 align:start position:0%
you know what agencies originally asked
for

02:44:17.510 --> 02:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:44:22.389 --> 02:44:22.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:25.030 --> 02:44:25.040 align:start position:0%
and then the last piece of this so it
 
02:44:27.830 --> 02:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
goes on for a few pages
 
02:44:29.429 --> 02:44:29.439 align:start position:0%
and the last two pieces that i'll
 
02:44:31.110 --> 02:44:31.120 align:start position:0%
mention in this document
 
02:44:32.870 --> 02:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
or the capital budget overview committee
 
02:44:34.309 --> 02:44:34.319 align:start position:0%
again i made comment to them
 
02:44:35.910 --> 02:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
um earlier about if there's a need to
 
02:44:38.710 --> 02:44:38.720 align:start position:0%
transfer but this committee also
 
02:44:41.910 --> 02:44:41.920 align:start position:0%
receives quarterly updates on um
 
02:44:44.630 --> 02:44:44.640 align:start position:0%
projects so the committee will see
 
02:44:44.640 --> 02:44:44.950 align:start position:0%
projects so the committee will see
what's

02:44:44.950 --> 02:44:44.960 align:start position:0%
what's
 
02:44:46.230 --> 02:44:46.240 align:start position:0%
what the status is of the various
 
02:44:48.469 --> 02:44:48.479 align:start position:0%
projects um
 
02:44:50.309 --> 02:44:50.319 align:start position:0%
if there's a question on a particular
 
02:44:51.590 --> 02:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
capital project and
 
02:44:53.110 --> 02:44:53.120 align:start position:0%
and the agency's having some issues they
 
02:44:54.710 --> 02:44:54.720 align:start position:0%
may come to the capital budget overview
 
02:44:54.720 --> 02:44:55.429 align:start position:0%
may come to the capital budget overview
committee

02:44:55.429 --> 02:44:55.439 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:44:58.150 --> 02:44:58.160 align:start position:0%
for some guidance on that um but this is
 
02:44:58.160 --> 02:44:58.950 align:start position:0%
for some guidance on that um but this is
the

02:44:58.950 --> 02:44:58.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:45:01.269 --> 02:45:01.279 align:start position:0%
and i make mention of it because uh
 
02:45:03.190 --> 02:45:03.200 align:start position:0%
probably a few of you from this
 
02:45:04.550 --> 02:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
this particular committee will be
 
02:45:06.469 --> 02:45:06.479 align:start position:0%
assigned a capital budget overview and
 
02:45:06.479 --> 02:45:06.790 align:start position:0%
assigned a capital budget overview and
or

02:45:06.790 --> 02:45:06.800 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:45:10.389 --> 02:45:10.399 align:start position:0%
long range so um
 
02:45:12.469 --> 02:45:12.479 align:start position:0%
there is a relationship in terms of some
 
02:45:13.910 --> 02:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
of the work you're doing on your your
 
02:45:15.590 --> 02:45:15.600 align:start position:0%
committee in public works
 
02:45:17.590 --> 02:45:17.600 align:start position:0%
and then again the other is long-range
 
02:45:19.110 --> 02:45:19.120 align:start position:0%
capital planning and utilization
 
02:45:19.120 --> 02:45:19.910 align:start position:0%
capital planning and utilization
committee

02:45:19.910 --> 02:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:45:21.269 --> 02:45:21.279 align:start position:0%
a lot of what they deal with is the
 
02:45:23.269 --> 02:45:23.279 align:start position:0%
disposal of land so land that may have
 
02:45:23.279 --> 02:45:23.590 align:start position:0%
disposal of land so land that may have
been

02:45:23.590 --> 02:45:23.600 align:start position:0%
been
 
02:45:26.389 --> 02:45:26.399 align:start position:0%
acquired by an agency typically
 
02:45:28.630 --> 02:45:28.640 align:start position:0%
department of transportation to
 
02:45:31.510 --> 02:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
either um change you know a highway or a
 
02:45:31.520 --> 02:45:32.230 align:start position:0%
either um change you know a highway or a
roadway

02:45:32.230 --> 02:45:32.240 align:start position:0%
roadway
 
02:45:34.150 --> 02:45:34.160 align:start position:0%
you know with their off-ramps on-ramps
 
02:45:35.750 --> 02:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
or things like that and then
 
02:45:37.910 --> 02:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
um after the project's done there's a
 
02:45:39.590 --> 02:45:39.600 align:start position:0%
piece of our track of land that is
 
02:45:41.269 --> 02:45:41.279 align:start position:0%
really of no use to the state anymore
 
02:45:41.750 --> 02:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
but an
 
02:45:46.070 --> 02:45:46.080 align:start position:0%
entity may want to purchase it
 
02:45:48.870 --> 02:45:48.880 align:start position:0%
that type of activity goes before the
 
02:45:50.630 --> 02:45:50.640 align:start position:0%
long-range committee for them to say
 
02:45:52.230 --> 02:45:52.240 align:start position:0%
yeah it's okay to dispose of that piece
 
02:45:53.510 --> 02:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
of property
 
02:45:55.030 --> 02:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
the other piece the long range does a
 
02:45:58.230 --> 02:45:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:01.750 --> 02:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
lease agreements so agencies for
 
02:46:03.510 --> 02:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
lease agreements over five years need to
 
02:46:05.269 --> 02:46:05.279 align:start position:0%
get approval for that
 
02:46:07.590 --> 02:46:07.600 align:start position:0%
and something the committee has seen in
 
02:46:09.670 --> 02:46:09.680 align:start position:0%
the last years a lot of extensions to
 
02:46:09.680 --> 02:46:10.710 align:start position:0%
the last years a lot of extensions to
leases

02:46:10.710 --> 02:46:10.720 align:start position:0%
leases
 
02:46:12.309 --> 02:46:12.319 align:start position:0%
so it may have been at least for three
 
02:46:13.670 --> 02:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
years to start with but they need to
 
02:46:15.110 --> 02:46:15.120 align:start position:0%
extend it for another three years they
 
02:46:16.550 --> 02:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
come before the committee
 
02:46:18.710 --> 02:46:18.720 align:start position:0%
because in total the the lease would
 
02:46:21.110 --> 02:46:21.120 align:start position:0%
have been longer for than five years
 
02:46:25.030 --> 02:46:25.040 align:start position:0%
um so so that's it on the actual
 
02:46:27.110 --> 02:46:27.120 align:start position:0%
presentation itself again it's meant to
 
02:46:28.950 --> 02:46:28.960 align:start position:0%
be more of a guidebook something that
 
02:46:30.469 --> 02:46:30.479 align:start position:0%
you have a question to be able to pick
 
02:46:32.070 --> 02:46:32.080 align:start position:0%
that up and say
 
02:46:34.309 --> 02:46:34.319 align:start position:0%
i heard i heard this mention can i find
 
02:46:35.349 --> 02:46:35.359 align:start position:0%
it here
 
02:46:37.830 --> 02:46:37.840 align:start position:0%
and and that's hopefully you'll be able
 
02:46:39.269 --> 02:46:39.279 align:start position:0%
to the answer would be yes and you'd be
 
02:46:40.870 --> 02:46:40.880 align:start position:0%
able to see it there
 
02:46:41.990 --> 02:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
i don't know if anybody has any
 
02:46:43.910 --> 02:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
questions about this particular document
 
02:46:47.510 --> 02:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:50.830 --> 02:46:50.840 align:start position:0%
if not i'm gonna back out of the
 
02:46:50.840 --> 02:46:52.150 align:start position:0%
if not i'm gonna back out of the
document

02:46:52.150 --> 02:46:52.160 align:start position:0%
document
 
02:46:53.510 --> 02:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
and i just want to click into the
 
02:46:55.429 --> 02:46:55.439 align:start position:0%
governor's capital budget so as i
 
02:46:55.439 --> 02:46:56.469 align:start position:0%
governor's capital budget so as i
mentioned

02:46:56.469 --> 02:46:56.479 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
02:47:00.950 --> 02:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
um back in june they had hearings
 
02:47:02.870 --> 02:47:02.880 align:start position:0%
and all the agencies that provided
 
02:47:05.670 --> 02:47:05.680 align:start position:0%
information we put up on our website
 
02:47:07.510 --> 02:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
so if you wanted to see what the
 
02:47:11.190 --> 02:47:11.200 align:start position:0%
department of agriculture provided
 
02:47:13.110 --> 02:47:13.120 align:start position:0%
this is their narrative to the capital
 
02:47:14.790 --> 02:47:14.800 align:start position:0%
request that they're making
 
02:47:17.750 --> 02:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
and so that may be useful to you as you
 
02:47:19.030 --> 02:47:19.040 align:start position:0%
have time now
 
02:47:20.389 --> 02:47:20.399 align:start position:0%
and you want to see what agencies were
 
02:47:21.910 --> 02:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
requesting and why this will give you a
 
02:47:24.630 --> 02:47:24.640 align:start position:0%
little bit more of that information
 
02:47:26.389 --> 02:47:26.399 align:start position:0%
or after you get the capital budget and
 
02:47:28.469 --> 02:47:28.479 align:start position:0%
you see a project got included
 
02:47:30.309 --> 02:47:30.319 align:start position:0%
you may want to go back to see what what
 
02:47:31.830 --> 02:47:31.840 align:start position:0%
were they originally thinking when they
 
02:47:37.510 --> 02:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:40.630 --> 02:47:40.640 align:start position:0%
the other thing that i mentioned is
 
02:47:41.990 --> 02:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
under the capital budget here there's
 
02:47:43.429 --> 02:47:43.439 align:start position:0%
the das which is department of
 
02:47:44.870 --> 02:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
administrative services
 
02:47:51.830 --> 02:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:55.750 --> 02:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:58.950 --> 02:47:58.960 align:start position:0%
in the last year is that the department
 
02:48:00.870 --> 02:48:00.880 align:start position:0%
of administrative services public works
 
02:48:00.880 --> 02:48:01.590 align:start position:0%
of administrative services public works
group

02:48:01.590 --> 02:48:01.600 align:start position:0%
group
 
02:48:03.990 --> 02:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
has been instructed to provide a status
 
02:48:05.670 --> 02:48:05.680 align:start position:0%
update to the governor on where projects
 
02:48:06.870 --> 02:48:06.880 align:start position:0%
are at
 
02:48:09.990 --> 02:48:10.000 align:start position:0%
with covid and as well as other things
 
02:48:11.750 --> 02:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
going on projects have been delayed in
 
02:48:14.150 --> 02:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
different ways
 
02:48:15.830 --> 02:48:15.840 align:start position:0%
and there was also some concern that we
 
02:48:18.150 --> 02:48:18.160 align:start position:0%
didn't want to incur
 
02:48:19.510 --> 02:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
you know additional debt if we could
 
02:48:21.429 --> 02:48:21.439 align:start position:0%
avoid it at this time not knowing
 
02:48:23.510 --> 02:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
what was happening with the pandemic and
 
02:48:25.110 --> 02:48:25.120 align:start position:0%
other activities
 
02:48:29.910 --> 02:48:29.920 align:start position:0%
so this report which is dated 10 30 2020
 
02:48:31.750 --> 02:48:31.760 align:start position:0%
was provided to the
 
02:48:35.590 --> 02:48:35.600 align:start position:0%
capital budget overview committee and um
 
02:48:37.750 --> 02:48:37.760 align:start position:0%
again it's just a status update of the
 
02:48:40.389 --> 02:48:40.399 align:start position:0%
projects that are in the 2019
 
02:48:42.469 --> 02:48:42.479 align:start position:0%
um capital budget capital budget for
 
02:48:44.790 --> 02:48:44.800 align:start position:0%
fiscal years 20 and 21
 
02:48:46.150 --> 02:48:46.160 align:start position:0%
and you can see where they're at with
 
02:48:46.160 --> 02:48:49.830 align:start position:0%
and you can see where they're at with
that

02:48:49.830 --> 02:48:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:52.870 --> 02:48:52.880 align:start position:0%
the document is a fluid document
 
02:48:55.830 --> 02:48:55.840 align:start position:0%
and i've made a request of public works
 
02:48:57.910 --> 02:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
to provide their most recent document it
 
02:49:00.070 --> 02:49:00.080 align:start position:0%
was due to be updated the middle of
 
02:49:03.110 --> 02:49:03.120 align:start position:0%
december um at this point
 
02:49:05.030 --> 02:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
i have not received anything in fact
 
02:49:07.429 --> 02:49:07.439 align:start position:0%
i've had no communication
 
02:49:10.150 --> 02:49:10.160 align:start position:0%
back to me from requests i've made from
 
02:49:10.160 --> 02:49:10.870 align:start position:0%
back to me from requests i've made from
the

02:49:10.870 --> 02:49:10.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:49:12.710 --> 02:49:12.720 align:start position:0%
ted cupper who's the public works
 
02:49:12.720 --> 02:49:15.349 align:start position:0%
ted cupper who's the public works
director

02:49:15.349 --> 02:49:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:17.349 --> 02:49:17.359 align:start position:0%
so i i will continue to try to get an
 
02:49:18.870 --> 02:49:18.880 align:start position:0%
updated document
 
02:49:20.870 --> 02:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
i've also talked to the deputy
 
02:49:22.710 --> 02:49:22.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner for administrative services
 
02:49:22.720 --> 02:49:23.030 align:start position:0%
commissioner for administrative services
about

02:49:23.030 --> 02:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:49:25.670 --> 02:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
getting a electronic copy of the capital
 
02:49:27.269 --> 02:49:27.279 align:start position:0%
improvement program
 
02:49:30.309 --> 02:49:30.319 align:start position:0%
um he's looking into that for me
 
02:49:33.190 --> 02:49:33.200 align:start position:0%
if we're able to get that we will put it
 
02:49:35.910 --> 02:49:35.920 align:start position:0%
on our website as well
 
02:49:40.790 --> 02:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
and it would be in this area so from
 
02:49:42.550 --> 02:49:42.560 align:start position:0%
any any work that we do for this
 
02:49:44.150 --> 02:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
committee going forward
 
02:49:47.030 --> 02:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
on the capital budget and there's a
 
02:49:48.309 --> 02:49:48.319 align:start position:0%
document involved
 
02:49:50.230 --> 02:49:50.240 align:start position:0%
we'll try to include it here so you can
 
02:49:52.150 --> 02:49:52.160 align:start position:0%
if you um
 
02:49:55.429 --> 02:49:55.439 align:start position:0%
do have to work remotely um
 
02:49:57.830 --> 02:49:57.840 align:start position:0%
you have a way to access some of the
 
02:49:57.840 --> 02:49:58.870 align:start position:0%
you have a way to access some of the
information

02:49:58.870 --> 02:49:58.880 align:start position:0%
information
 
02:50:00.469 --> 02:50:00.479 align:start position:0%
that agencies may have provided or
 
02:50:02.790 --> 02:50:02.800 align:start position:0%
documents that were handed out
 
02:50:07.269 --> 02:50:07.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:09.190 --> 02:50:09.200 align:start position:0%
even if you're doing a hybrid situation
 
02:50:10.630 --> 02:50:10.640 align:start position:0%
there may be times when you come into
 
02:50:11.349 --> 02:50:11.359 align:start position:0%
the office
 
02:50:13.590 --> 02:50:13.600 align:start position:0%
or come into the committee room and you
 
02:50:15.750 --> 02:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
may forget something there
 
02:50:17.349 --> 02:50:17.359 align:start position:0%
hopefully you know if it's something
 
02:50:19.110 --> 02:50:19.120 align:start position:0%
that we have on our website that will be
 
02:50:23.990 --> 02:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:26.550 --> 02:50:26.560 align:start position:0%
so i don't know if that's really all i
 
02:50:36.790 --> 02:50:36.800 align:start position:0%
had unless there's any questions for me
 
02:50:40.230 --> 02:50:40.240 align:start position:0%
mr chairman can i ask a question sure go
 
02:50:40.240 --> 02:50:41.269 align:start position:0%
mr chairman can i ask a question sure go
ahead

02:50:41.269 --> 02:50:41.279 align:start position:0%
ahead
 
02:50:43.269 --> 02:50:43.279 align:start position:0%
i was just wondering i mean you showed
 
02:50:46.070 --> 02:50:46.080 align:start position:0%
us that the document there
 
02:50:48.309 --> 02:50:48.319 align:start position:0%
and whether you put it up there and we
 
02:50:49.990 --> 02:50:50.000 align:start position:0%
try to try to print it off
 
02:50:52.630 --> 02:50:52.640 align:start position:0%
or whatever i just wondered if there was
 
02:50:53.830 --> 02:50:53.840 align:start position:0%
some other way
 
02:50:55.750 --> 02:50:55.760 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure you don't want to put it in
 
02:50:57.670 --> 02:50:57.680 align:start position:0%
the mail
 
02:51:00.790 --> 02:51:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:03.990 --> 02:51:04.000 align:start position:0%
um so at this point we've been trying
 
02:51:05.990 --> 02:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
to put things on our websites and we've
 
02:51:08.070 --> 02:51:08.080 align:start position:0%
been emailing documents to
 
02:51:12.150 --> 02:51:12.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:15.349 --> 02:51:15.359 align:start position:0%
we've had we've part of the challenge
 
02:51:18.550 --> 02:51:18.560 align:start position:0%
this document is is not um
 
02:51:20.630 --> 02:51:20.640 align:start position:0%
if need be at some point we possibly
 
02:51:21.990 --> 02:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
could mail it to you
 
02:51:24.630 --> 02:51:24.640 align:start position:0%
um but thinking going forward if you're
 
02:51:26.389 --> 02:51:26.399 align:start position:0%
thinking about agency presentations and
 
02:51:28.630 --> 02:51:28.640 align:start position:0%
having those mailed to you
 
02:51:31.910 --> 02:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
the issue with that is is timing so
 
02:51:33.830 --> 02:51:33.840 align:start position:0%
we've had an issue even with the fiscal
 
02:51:35.590 --> 02:51:35.600 align:start position:0%
committee this week we have that
 
02:51:38.870 --> 02:51:38.880 align:start position:0%
meetings for tomorrow as of monday one
 
02:51:40.309 --> 02:51:40.319 align:start position:0%
of the members of the committee hadn't
 
02:51:40.319 --> 02:51:42.870 align:start position:0%
of the members of the committee hadn't
received

02:51:42.870 --> 02:51:42.880 align:start position:0%
received
 
02:51:45.110 --> 02:51:45.120 align:start position:0%
their their information their paper
 
02:51:46.790 --> 02:51:46.800 align:start position:0%
information we made copies
 
02:51:50.469 --> 02:51:50.479 align:start position:0%
that had been out for a week already um
 
02:51:52.630 --> 02:51:52.640 align:start position:0%
so you know you've read i've seen in the
 
02:51:54.070 --> 02:51:54.080 align:start position:0%
news and i'm sure you all have heard in
 
02:51:54.870 --> 02:51:54.880 align:start position:0%
the news that
 
02:51:56.550 --> 02:51:56.560 align:start position:0%
you know the postal service has been a
 
02:51:58.710 --> 02:51:58.720 align:start position:0%
little slower with the volumes and and
 
02:52:01.990 --> 02:52:02.000 align:start position:0%
with some of their workload issues um
 
02:52:04.150 --> 02:52:04.160 align:start position:0%
so timing of getting something to you
 
02:52:05.670 --> 02:52:05.680 align:start position:0%
may be an issue but if you're
 
02:52:08.550 --> 02:52:08.560 align:start position:0%
for this particular document um we can
 
02:52:10.389 --> 02:52:10.399 align:start position:0%
try to make it available in hard copy we
 
02:52:12.550 --> 02:52:12.560 align:start position:0%
can leave copies in the committee room
 
02:52:14.070 --> 02:52:14.080 align:start position:0%
for when people come into the committee
 
02:52:16.230 --> 02:52:16.240 align:start position:0%
room um
 
02:52:17.990 --> 02:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
one thing at this point we will not be
 
02:52:19.590 --> 02:52:19.600 align:start position:0%
back in the office for at least the next
 
02:52:20.309 --> 02:52:20.319 align:start position:0%
week or
 
02:52:23.750 --> 02:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
week or so you know it would be sometime
 
02:52:25.510 --> 02:52:25.520 align:start position:0%
the end of january before we
 
02:52:28.790 --> 02:52:28.800 align:start position:0%
are allowed back into the office so
 
02:52:31.190 --> 02:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
that um i wouldn't be able to mail
 
02:52:33.910 --> 02:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
anything to you before that
 
02:52:35.670 --> 02:52:35.680 align:start position:0%
well but the thing is that i was i don't
 
02:52:36.950 --> 02:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
know about other members of the
 
02:52:36.960 --> 02:52:37.510 align:start position:0%
know about other members of the
committee

02:52:37.510 --> 02:52:37.520 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:52:40.830 --> 02:52:40.840 align:start position:0%
but um i wasn't so much concerned about
 
02:52:44.230 --> 02:52:44.240 align:start position:0%
the paperwork that the agencies would
 
02:52:44.240 --> 02:52:44.790 align:start position:0%
the paperwork that the agencies would
have

02:52:44.790 --> 02:52:44.800 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:52:47.670 --> 02:52:47.680 align:start position:0%
i mean to look at that stuff online i
 
02:52:49.030 --> 02:52:49.040 align:start position:0%
don't think is a
 
02:52:52.070 --> 02:52:52.080 align:start position:0%
big deal but for for this
 
02:52:58.950 --> 02:52:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:02.630 --> 02:53:02.640 align:start position:0%
um i am working with the speaker
 
02:53:05.750 --> 02:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
about when we have the agencies come in
 
02:53:07.670 --> 02:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
to talk about their portion of the
 
02:53:08.870 --> 02:53:08.880 align:start position:0%
capital budget
 
02:53:11.190 --> 02:53:11.200 align:start position:0%
to do it in person in front of the
 
02:53:11.200 --> 02:53:12.309 align:start position:0%
to do it in person in front of the
committee

02:53:12.309 --> 02:53:12.319 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:53:14.469 --> 02:53:14.479 align:start position:0%
granted not all of the committee members
 
02:53:17.030 --> 02:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
may be participating that day
 
02:53:19.429 --> 02:53:19.439 align:start position:0%
but the vast majority of us probably
 
02:53:19.439 --> 02:53:20.309 align:start position:0%
but the vast majority of us probably
will

02:53:20.309 --> 02:53:20.319 align:start position:0%
will
 
02:53:24.710 --> 02:53:24.720 align:start position:0%
um it's gonna be
 
02:53:27.830 --> 02:53:27.840 align:start position:0%
not not pleasant you know it's going to
 
02:53:29.030 --> 02:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
be hard to get
 
02:53:32.469 --> 02:53:32.479 align:start position:0%
stuff but as mr shea said timeliness is
 
02:53:34.150 --> 02:53:34.160 align:start position:0%
the real issue of
 
02:53:38.070 --> 02:53:38.080 align:start position:0%
if uh department of safety has
 
02:53:40.790 --> 02:53:40.800 align:start position:0%
you know 15 pages of stuff that they
 
02:53:42.230 --> 02:53:42.240 align:start position:0%
want us to read
 
02:53:46.389 --> 02:53:46.399 align:start position:0%
how do you get it to everybody um
 
02:53:49.510 --> 02:53:49.520 align:start position:0%
before they they come in to testify
 
02:53:51.910 --> 02:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
and they may not have it before the day
 
02:53:51.920 --> 02:53:54.870 align:start position:0%
and they may not have it before the day
before

02:53:54.870 --> 02:53:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:56.950 --> 02:53:56.960 align:start position:0%
and just a further comment um
 
02:53:58.070 --> 02:53:58.080 align:start position:0%
representative abbott i mean
 
02:53:59.429 --> 02:53:59.439 align:start position:0%
we're still trying to figure out how to
 
02:54:01.349 --> 02:54:01.359 align:start position:0%
send you the hard copy of this document
 
02:54:01.359 --> 02:54:02.150 align:start position:0%
send you the hard copy of this document
here

02:54:02.150 --> 02:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:54:03.830 --> 02:54:03.840 align:start position:0%
so once we get some direction on how to
 
02:54:05.349 --> 02:54:05.359 align:start position:0%
do that we may
 
02:54:07.910 --> 02:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
at that time include the um presentation
 
02:54:08.469 --> 02:54:08.479 align:start position:0%
that i
 
02:54:10.070 --> 02:54:10.080 align:start position:0%
just did you know went over with you
 
02:54:11.670 --> 02:54:11.680 align:start position:0%
online um
 
02:54:13.110 --> 02:54:13.120 align:start position:0%
it's not that we don't want to get it to
 
02:54:15.269 --> 02:54:15.279 align:start position:0%
you it's just we're we're limited in
 
02:54:17.030 --> 02:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
some of our abilities at this moment
 
02:54:19.030 --> 02:54:19.040 align:start position:0%
um you know getting access to the
 
02:54:20.870 --> 02:54:20.880 align:start position:0%
building getting access to
 
02:54:23.429 --> 02:54:23.439 align:start position:0%
print materials and it's not just the
 
02:54:25.830 --> 02:54:25.840 align:start position:0%
capital budget committee that we're
 
02:54:28.309 --> 02:54:28.319 align:start position:0%
trying to come up with a way to do this
 
02:54:29.030 --> 02:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
we have
 
02:54:30.230 --> 02:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
you know for us we have the ways and
 
02:54:31.670 --> 02:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
means committee and anything they might
 
02:54:31.680 --> 02:54:32.550 align:start position:0%
means committee and anything they might
need

02:54:32.550 --> 02:54:32.560 align:start position:0%
need
 
02:54:36.230 --> 02:54:36.240 align:start position:0%
but even more so um and scary so is
 
02:54:38.469 --> 02:54:38.479 align:start position:0%
is the finance committee and the
 
02:54:40.550 --> 02:54:40.560 align:start position:0%
operating budget
 
02:54:42.309 --> 02:54:42.319 align:start position:0%
we've had some members suggest that they
 
02:54:44.230 --> 02:54:44.240 align:start position:0%
would like to see agency
 
02:54:48.070 --> 02:54:48.080 align:start position:0%
budget requests in paper format which we
 
02:54:50.309 --> 02:54:50.319 align:start position:0%
have in our office but they are
 
02:54:52.630 --> 02:54:52.640 align:start position:0%
thousands of pages long and thinking
 
02:54:54.790 --> 02:54:54.800 align:start position:0%
about how to get that to the member
 
02:54:57.190 --> 02:54:57.200 align:start position:0%
um it's not something that we're feeling
 
02:54:59.269 --> 02:54:59.279 align:start position:0%
comfortable in terms of trying to
 
02:55:03.190 --> 02:55:03.200 align:start position:0%
uh mail or ship to to the members
 
02:55:06.550 --> 02:55:06.560 align:start position:0%
um at this time it's just
 
02:55:08.230 --> 02:55:08.240 align:start position:0%
so our office you know we've had
 
02:55:10.150 --> 02:55:10.160 align:start position:0%
requests for various documents and and
 
02:55:12.070 --> 02:55:12.080 align:start position:0%
we're trying to accommodate it through
 
02:55:15.030 --> 02:55:15.040 align:start position:0%
electronic means at this time and trying
 
02:55:16.469 --> 02:55:16.479 align:start position:0%
to come up with a plan to address all
 
02:55:18.070 --> 02:55:18.080 align:start position:0%
the committees that might request things
 
02:55:19.269 --> 02:55:19.279 align:start position:0%
from us
 
02:55:21.590 --> 02:55:21.600 align:start position:0%
so that we're not treating or offering
 
02:55:24.309 --> 02:55:24.319 align:start position:0%
something to one group and not another
 
02:55:27.510 --> 02:55:27.520 align:start position:0%
i understand i just you know
 
02:55:30.469 --> 02:55:30.479 align:start position:0%
if there was some point possible to do
 
02:55:30.479 --> 02:55:30.870 align:start position:0%
if there was some point possible to do
that

02:55:30.870 --> 02:55:30.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:55:34.469 --> 02:55:34.479 align:start position:0%
to get it to us that's all yep
 
02:55:36.870 --> 02:55:36.880 align:start position:0%
yeah well i'll definitely um like i said
 
02:55:38.710 --> 02:55:38.720 align:start position:0%
once i know how we can get you the
 
02:55:41.830 --> 02:55:41.840 align:start position:0%
the capital improvement program book
 
02:55:44.469 --> 02:55:44.479 align:start position:0%
um i'll make sure that a copy of the
 
02:55:45.670 --> 02:55:45.680 align:start position:0%
presentation today is
 
02:55:50.070 --> 02:55:50.080 align:start position:0%
is uh you know attached to that you know
 
02:55:51.910 --> 02:55:51.920 align:start position:0%
so that you can have that or in a folder
 
02:55:53.269 --> 02:55:53.279 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:55:55.269 --> 02:55:55.279 align:start position:0%
again we we may end up putting things in
 
02:55:57.510 --> 02:55:57.520 align:start position:0%
an envelope with each member's name on
 
02:55:59.349 --> 02:55:59.359 align:start position:0%
it and
 
02:56:01.510 --> 02:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
make it available to you when when you
 
02:56:03.349 --> 02:56:03.359 align:start position:0%
can get in the building or
 
02:56:05.670 --> 02:56:05.680 align:start position:0%
um you know if you have other ways to to
 
02:56:06.469 --> 02:56:06.479 align:start position:0%
access it
 
02:56:08.950 --> 02:56:08.960 align:start position:0%
again we just don't know at this point
 
02:56:10.389 --> 02:56:10.399 align:start position:0%
and that's that's conversation
 
02:56:13.670 --> 02:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
had in the last couple of days as um
 
02:56:15.110 --> 02:56:15.120 align:start position:0%
we've been meeting with the various
 
02:56:17.110 --> 02:56:17.120 align:start position:0%
committees that we staff and some of the
 
02:56:17.120 --> 02:56:18.309 align:start position:0%
committees that we staff and some of the
requests

02:56:18.309 --> 02:56:18.319 align:start position:0%
requests
 
02:56:21.910 --> 02:56:21.920 align:start position:0%
and and as i uh you know finances is a
 
02:56:23.590 --> 02:56:23.600 align:start position:0%
heavier lift because of the volume of
 
02:56:25.110 --> 02:56:25.120 align:start position:0%
paper that they have and so we're just
 
02:56:26.389 --> 02:56:26.399 align:start position:0%
trying to be consistent with what we
 
02:56:26.399 --> 02:56:27.190 align:start position:0%
trying to be consistent with what we
offer

02:56:27.190 --> 02:56:27.200 align:start position:0%
offer
 
02:56:29.510 --> 02:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
each of the groups that we work with but
 
02:56:30.630 --> 02:56:30.640 align:start position:0%
i understand it
 
02:56:32.309 --> 02:56:32.319 align:start position:0%
looking at things online on a computer
 
02:56:35.269 --> 02:56:35.279 align:start position:0%
when you're on a remote meeting
 
02:56:39.750 --> 02:56:39.760 align:start position:0%
is challenging um i mean
 
02:56:42.870 --> 02:56:42.880 align:start position:0%
nimble and quick on the computer
 
02:56:45.590 --> 02:56:45.600 align:start position:0%
and uh yeah i have closed myself out of
 
02:56:47.910 --> 02:56:47.920 align:start position:0%
remote meetings in an effort to try to
 
02:56:50.790 --> 02:56:50.800 align:start position:0%
bring material up for um committee
 
02:56:53.030 --> 02:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
members that that we're working with and
 
02:56:55.750 --> 02:56:55.760 align:start position:0%
so i i understand the challenge and and
 
02:56:57.030 --> 02:56:57.040 align:start position:0%
uh hopefully
 
02:56:58.469 --> 02:56:58.479 align:start position:0%
you know in the near future things will
 
02:57:01.510 --> 02:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:03.510 --> 02:57:03.520 align:start position:0%
christianity can you go ahead and close
 
02:57:04.870 --> 02:57:04.880 align:start position:0%
out the sure
 
02:57:06.550 --> 02:57:06.560 align:start position:0%
green sharing so that we can see if
 
02:57:09.750 --> 02:57:09.760 align:start position:0%
anybody has questions
 
02:57:12.870 --> 02:57:12.880 align:start position:0%
yeah i do representative newman
 
02:57:16.150 --> 02:57:16.160 align:start position:0%
yes yes thank you boy i'm not used to
 
02:57:18.150 --> 02:57:18.160 align:start position:0%
this you have to go left to go right
 
02:57:21.990 --> 02:57:22.000 align:start position:0%
and whatever um i i certainly
 
02:57:25.110 --> 02:57:25.120 align:start position:0%
i can't i don't understand all of the
 
02:57:25.120 --> 02:57:25.750 align:start position:0%
i can't i don't understand all of the
printing

02:57:25.750 --> 02:57:25.760 align:start position:0%
printing
 
02:57:28.870 --> 02:57:28.880 align:start position:0%
difficulties but i can appreciate how
 
02:57:31.030 --> 02:57:31.040 align:start position:0%
challenging it is to try and get stuff
 
02:57:34.790 --> 02:57:34.800 align:start position:0%
printed right now the only suggest
 
02:57:37.670 --> 02:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
my suggestion for what it's worth when
 
02:57:38.630 --> 02:57:38.640 align:start position:0%
we took our
 
02:57:42.070 --> 02:57:42.080 align:start position:0%
when many of us took our oath of office
 
02:57:44.790 --> 02:57:44.800 align:start position:0%
several of us delivered them up um
 
02:57:46.710 --> 02:57:46.720 align:start position:0%
personally and i know we went to the
 
02:57:46.720 --> 02:57:48.070 align:start position:0%
personally and i know we went to the
security

02:57:48.070 --> 02:57:48.080 align:start position:0%
security
 
02:57:51.349 --> 02:57:51.359 align:start position:0%
um door on whatever street it is and
 
02:57:53.269 --> 02:57:53.279 align:start position:0%
and a security person came out we handed
 
02:57:55.349 --> 02:57:55.359 align:start position:0%
them in i don't know that if there's a
 
02:57:56.710 --> 02:57:56.720 align:start position:0%
way to get material
 
02:58:00.150 --> 02:58:00.160 align:start position:0%
printed if they could be in an
 
02:58:02.710 --> 02:58:02.720 align:start position:0%
envelope or something and like i'm
 
02:58:04.790 --> 02:58:04.800 align:start position:0%
thinking there's three of us from nashua
 
02:58:06.790 --> 02:58:06.800 align:start position:0%
if one of us went up and picked
 
02:58:08.469 --> 02:58:08.479 align:start position:0%
something up
 
02:58:10.630 --> 02:58:10.640 align:start position:0%
i don't know about other areas and i
 
02:58:12.469 --> 02:58:12.479 align:start position:0%
don't even know if that's practical or
 
02:58:16.070 --> 02:58:16.080 align:start position:0%
or possible given space limitations but
 
02:58:18.070 --> 02:58:18.080 align:start position:0%
that's my suggestion if we could pick up
 
02:58:24.950 --> 02:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:27.990 --> 02:58:28.000 align:start position:0%
my idea is if print material could be in
 
02:58:30.230 --> 02:58:30.240 align:start position:0%
an envelope at the security office
 
02:58:32.070 --> 02:58:32.080 align:start position:0%
we'd call security when we were outside
 
02:58:33.269 --> 02:58:33.279 align:start position:0%
the door
 
02:58:35.190 --> 02:58:35.200 align:start position:0%
they'd say here you're picking it up for
 
02:58:38.309 --> 02:58:38.319 align:start position:0%
nashua whatever and and deliver it out
 
02:58:40.950 --> 02:58:40.960 align:start position:0%
um i i just want to follow up my concern
 
02:58:43.349 --> 02:58:43.359 align:start position:0%
with trying to go into the building
 
02:58:46.550 --> 02:58:46.560 align:start position:0%
in the very near future is your
 
02:58:49.830 --> 02:58:49.840 align:start position:0%
the elevator i wouldn't take now at all
 
02:58:52.389 --> 02:58:52.399 align:start position:0%
and i don't know about stairwells and
 
02:58:53.670 --> 02:58:53.680 align:start position:0%
hallways and whatever
 
02:58:56.309 --> 02:58:56.319 align:start position:0%
despite what's going on in an actual
 
02:58:58.790 --> 02:58:58.800 align:start position:0%
double room so that's why i suggested
 
02:59:00.469 --> 02:59:00.479 align:start position:0%
if something could be made available we
 
02:59:03.190 --> 02:59:03.200 align:start position:0%
could pick it up at a door
 
02:59:05.510 --> 02:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
so represent newman in response to that
 
02:59:07.269 --> 02:59:07.279 align:start position:0%
the idea is a good idea
 
02:59:09.349 --> 02:59:09.359 align:start position:0%
um i just don't know if our office can
 
02:59:09.359 --> 02:59:10.790 align:start position:0%
um i just don't know if our office can
unilaterally

02:59:10.790 --> 02:59:10.800 align:start position:0%
unilaterally
 
02:59:12.150 --> 02:59:12.160 align:start position:0%
say that's what we're going to do for
 
02:59:14.150 --> 02:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
the committees um
 
02:59:15.990 --> 02:59:16.000 align:start position:0%
and so we we are trying to work with the
 
02:59:17.670 --> 02:59:17.680 align:start position:0%
speaker's office and others to make sure
 
02:59:17.680 --> 02:59:18.469 align:start position:0%
speaker's office and others to make sure
that

02:59:18.469 --> 02:59:18.479 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:59:20.630 --> 02:59:20.640 align:start position:0%
we don't create something that then is
 
02:59:22.550 --> 02:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
expected by every committee
 
02:59:24.230 --> 02:59:24.240 align:start position:0%
and then i don't know if security would
 
02:59:27.990 --> 02:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
be able to manage that kind of of a flow
 
02:59:29.830 --> 02:59:29.840 align:start position:0%
you know i want i want a paper copy of a
 
02:59:32.150 --> 02:59:32.160 align:start position:0%
bill i want a paper copy of
 
02:59:35.429 --> 02:59:35.439 align:start position:0%
me um so again it's not that we're
 
02:59:36.870 --> 02:59:36.880 align:start position:0%
that i'm trying to be resistant to
 
02:59:38.389 --> 02:59:38.399 align:start position:0%
providing you what you're asking for it
 
02:59:38.399 --> 02:59:38.710 align:start position:0%
providing you what you're asking for it
just

02:59:38.710 --> 02:59:38.720 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:59:41.190 --> 02:59:41.200 align:start position:0%
i want to do it in a way that doesn't
 
02:59:42.710 --> 02:59:42.720 align:start position:0%
step on the toes of the other committees
 
02:59:42.720 --> 02:59:43.750 align:start position:0%
step on the toes of the other committees
essentially

02:59:43.750 --> 02:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
02:59:47.110 --> 02:59:47.120 align:start position:0%
i understand that yep and so if once i
 
02:59:48.950 --> 02:59:48.960 align:start position:0%
get some direction i will certainly let
 
02:59:51.030 --> 02:59:51.040 align:start position:0%
um chairman graham know and and
 
02:59:53.429 --> 02:59:53.439 align:start position:0%
um will try to get you the information
 
02:59:54.790 --> 02:59:54.800 align:start position:0%
so that you can do your work
 
02:59:56.870 --> 02:59:56.880 align:start position:0%
and and understanding hard copies of
 
02:59:58.630 --> 02:59:58.640 align:start position:0%
some of this is important
 
03:00:01.349 --> 03:00:01.359 align:start position:0%
um we we will try to do our best to to
 
03:00:03.269 --> 03:00:03.279 align:start position:0%
take care of that and try to accommodate
 
03:00:04.870 --> 03:00:04.880 align:start position:0%
this committee and and the others that
 
03:00:06.469 --> 03:00:06.479 align:start position:0%
we work with to
 
03:00:08.309 --> 03:00:08.319 align:start position:0%
make sure you have the materials and and
 
03:00:10.389 --> 03:00:10.399 align:start position:0%
and the information that you need to
 
03:00:12.790 --> 03:00:12.800 align:start position:0%
um if you have to work from home or from
 
03:00:14.230 --> 03:00:14.240 align:start position:0%
a remote site that you have everything
 
03:00:15.429 --> 03:00:15.439 align:start position:0%
that you need
 
03:00:19.269 --> 03:00:19.279 align:start position:0%
thank you do we have any other questions
 
03:00:21.590 --> 03:00:21.600 align:start position:0%
on the presentation
 
03:00:24.950 --> 03:00:24.960 align:start position:0%
uh mr speaker yeah
 
03:00:26.990 --> 03:00:27.000 align:start position:0%
possible and i don't know what the
 
03:00:27.000 --> 03:00:28.550 align:start position:0%
possible and i don't know what the
confidentiality

03:00:28.550 --> 03:00:28.560 align:start position:0%
confidentiality
 
03:00:31.750 --> 03:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
of some of these documents is but
 
03:00:35.830 --> 03:00:35.840 align:start position:0%
um would it be possible to for
 
03:00:38.710 --> 03:00:38.720 align:start position:0%
uh mr shea's division to send this to
 
03:00:41.030 --> 03:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
like the local fedex offices where we
 
03:00:43.190 --> 03:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
could pick it up they could copy it
 
03:00:44.790 --> 03:00:44.800 align:start position:0%
put it in an envelope and we could pick
 
03:00:47.590 --> 03:00:47.600 align:start position:0%
it up there i know it's a cost
 
03:00:49.190 --> 03:00:49.200 align:start position:0%
but it's going to cost the print them
 
03:00:50.630 --> 03:00:50.640 align:start position:0%
one way or another
 
03:00:53.750 --> 03:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
and there are fedex offices pretty much
 
03:00:55.190 --> 03:00:55.200 align:start position:0%
all over the state
 
03:00:59.510 --> 03:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
i think from plymouth south yeah
 
03:01:01.670 --> 03:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
so represent thompson again it's it's
 
03:01:05.190 --> 03:01:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:06.870 --> 03:01:06.880 align:start position:0%
we want to provide the information we
 
03:01:08.230 --> 03:01:08.240 align:start position:0%
want to get it to you we just want to do
 
03:01:09.750 --> 03:01:09.760 align:start position:0%
it in a fashion that is consistent with
 
03:01:11.429 --> 03:01:11.439 align:start position:0%
how other documents are being provided
 
03:01:12.790 --> 03:01:12.800 align:start position:0%
to members
 
03:01:16.630 --> 03:01:16.640 align:start position:0%
um so we have discussed different ways
 
03:01:16.640 --> 03:01:16.950 align:start position:0%
um so we have discussed different ways
we

03:01:16.950 --> 03:01:16.960 align:start position:0%
we
 
03:01:18.710 --> 03:01:18.720 align:start position:0%
we talked about staples we've talked
 
03:01:20.710 --> 03:01:20.720 align:start position:0%
about fedex we've talked about
 
03:01:23.429 --> 03:01:23.439 align:start position:0%
um representative newman's idea of maybe
 
03:01:24.790 --> 03:01:24.800 align:start position:0%
having something available at the front
 
03:01:24.800 --> 03:01:25.750 align:start position:0%
having something available at the front
desk

03:01:25.750 --> 03:01:25.760 align:start position:0%
desk
 
03:01:28.150 --> 03:01:28.160 align:start position:0%
um we've mailed some smaller documents
 
03:01:29.429 --> 03:01:29.439 align:start position:0%
to individuals
 
03:01:30.870 --> 03:01:30.880 align:start position:0%
we're not smaller documents to the
 
03:01:33.349 --> 03:01:33.359 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee we've mailed those
 
03:01:36.550 --> 03:01:36.560 align:start position:0%
um the last couple of months it just
 
03:01:38.950 --> 03:01:38.960 align:start position:0%
requires somebody to go into the office
 
03:01:41.750 --> 03:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
and and make copies of all that and then
 
03:01:44.790 --> 03:01:44.800 align:start position:0%
and drop it in the mail
 
03:01:47.030 --> 03:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
because some of these are are documents
 
03:01:48.630 --> 03:01:48.640 align:start position:0%
that we um
 
03:01:50.550 --> 03:01:50.560 align:start position:0%
we don't have control of until just
 
03:01:51.990 --> 03:01:52.000 align:start position:0%
prior to a meeting
 
03:01:54.790 --> 03:01:54.800 align:start position:0%
um it does it does take a little time to
 
03:01:55.750 --> 03:01:55.760 align:start position:0%
get some things to
 
03:01:57.750 --> 03:01:57.760 align:start position:0%
organize and ready to mail or send out
 
03:01:59.590 --> 03:01:59.600 align:start position:0%
or become available
 
03:02:04.469 --> 03:02:04.479 align:start position:0%
once we have a solution i apologize
 
03:02:09.110 --> 03:02:09.120 align:start position:0%
deliver all of them my door um
 
03:02:11.030 --> 03:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
so once we have a solution and we have
 
03:02:12.550 --> 03:02:12.560 align:start position:0%
some direction we will certainly get the
 
03:02:12.560 --> 03:02:14.070 align:start position:0%
some direction we will certainly get the
documents

03:02:14.070 --> 03:02:14.080 align:start position:0%
documents
 
03:02:15.269 --> 03:02:15.279 align:start position:0%
and it may be something where we
 
03:02:17.269 --> 03:02:17.279 align:start position:0%
intentionally wait
 
03:02:19.030 --> 03:02:19.040 align:start position:0%
so that we know that there's a couple of
 
03:02:20.710 --> 03:02:20.720 align:start position:0%
pieces of information that we want to
 
03:02:23.110 --> 03:02:23.120 align:start position:0%
provide you but it's not available yet
 
03:02:25.269 --> 03:02:25.279 align:start position:0%
for instance the treasurer will probably
 
03:02:27.030 --> 03:02:27.040 align:start position:0%
talk about their offering statement
 
03:02:29.510 --> 03:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
document when she comes on that's a
 
03:02:30.710 --> 03:02:30.720 align:start position:0%
document that you should
 
03:02:32.230 --> 03:02:32.240 align:start position:0%
i would recommend having that in a hard
 
03:02:34.630 --> 03:02:34.640 align:start position:0%
copy if you can never get in a hard copy
 
03:02:38.469 --> 03:02:38.479 align:start position:0%
it's a um
 
03:02:40.550 --> 03:02:40.560 align:start position:0%
this is this isn't the latest one that i
 
03:02:42.150 --> 03:02:42.160 align:start position:0%
have but this is one from
 
03:02:44.630 --> 03:02:44.640 align:start position:0%
earlier and i just show you because i've
 
03:02:46.150 --> 03:02:46.160 align:start position:0%
tabbed different things and it's easy
 
03:02:47.190 --> 03:02:47.200 align:start position:0%
for me to go in
 
03:02:50.309 --> 03:02:50.319 align:start position:0%
when there's a question made of me um
 
03:02:51.670 --> 03:02:51.680 align:start position:0%
again that's not the most recent one
 
03:02:53.830 --> 03:02:53.840 align:start position:0%
that's an older one but there's great
 
03:02:55.429 --> 03:02:55.439 align:start position:0%
information in that document so
 
03:02:56.710 --> 03:02:56.720 align:start position:0%
it may be something where we know
 
03:02:57.670 --> 03:02:57.680 align:start position:0%
there's going to be pieces of
 
03:02:58.870 --> 03:02:58.880 align:start position:0%
information that are going to come to
 
03:02:59.830 --> 03:02:59.840 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
03:03:01.590 --> 03:03:01.600 align:start position:0%
and we try to put a packet together so
 
03:03:02.870 --> 03:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
that we can
 
03:03:05.750 --> 03:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
kind of do it i've already talked to the
 
03:03:08.389 --> 03:03:08.399 align:start position:0%
treasurer about that
 
03:03:10.950 --> 03:03:10.960 align:start position:0%
and the challenge that we were coming up
 
03:03:12.550 --> 03:03:12.560 align:start position:0%
with is the same one
 
03:03:14.950 --> 03:03:14.960 align:start position:0%
we've been talking about is how do you
 
03:03:16.309 --> 03:03:16.319 align:start position:0%
get it
 
03:03:19.349 --> 03:03:19.359 align:start position:0%
out to every member in in a timely
 
03:03:21.030 --> 03:03:21.040 align:start position:0%
fashion but i agree that
 
03:03:23.269 --> 03:03:23.279 align:start position:0%
we all should have a copy of that
 
03:03:25.349 --> 03:03:25.359 align:start position:0%
because it talks about
 
03:03:28.550 --> 03:03:28.560 align:start position:0%
every facet of this state
 
03:03:32.630 --> 03:03:32.640 align:start position:0%
from the retirement to schools to
 
03:03:35.349 --> 03:03:35.359 align:start position:0%
education level everything that goes
 
03:03:35.359 --> 03:03:36.790 align:start position:0%
education level everything that goes
into

03:03:36.790 --> 03:03:36.800 align:start position:0%
into
 
03:03:39.030 --> 03:03:39.040 align:start position:0%
what the bond council and the
 
03:03:41.269 --> 03:03:41.279 align:start position:0%
bondholders want to know about
 
03:03:44.309 --> 03:03:44.319 align:start position:0%
the fiscal responsibility and capability
 
03:03:48.790 --> 03:03:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:51.349 --> 03:03:51.359 align:start position:0%
i agree represent graham and um you know
 
03:03:54.790 --> 03:03:54.800 align:start position:0%
there's a few documents like that um
 
03:03:57.269 --> 03:03:57.279 align:start position:0%
that we typically would bring to you
 
03:03:57.910 --> 03:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
when we
 
03:04:01.269 --> 03:04:01.279 align:start position:0%
in in the old days so to speak
 
03:04:03.030 --> 03:04:03.040 align:start position:0%
we come in with a pile of documents and
 
03:04:04.550 --> 03:04:04.560 align:start position:0%
leave them for you and
 
03:04:07.590 --> 03:04:07.600 align:start position:0%
and and talk to them um you know we
 
03:04:08.870 --> 03:04:08.880 align:start position:0%
would work with the treasurer to make
 
03:04:10.790 --> 03:04:10.800 align:start position:0%
sure we had the offering statements all
 
03:04:12.790 --> 03:04:12.800 align:start position:0%
available to you so that you would have
 
03:04:14.469 --> 03:04:14.479 align:start position:0%
that information and so it's just a
 
03:04:15.349 --> 03:04:15.359 align:start position:0%
different time
 
03:04:19.110 --> 03:04:19.120 align:start position:0%
trying to um accommodate the needs
 
03:04:21.110 --> 03:04:21.120 align:start position:0%
coordination and direction and once we
 
03:04:22.550 --> 03:04:22.560 align:start position:0%
have that we'll we'll get you
 
03:04:26.070 --> 03:04:26.080 align:start position:0%
what we can but keep asking
 
03:04:29.429 --> 03:04:29.439 align:start position:0%
don't don't be afraid to keep asking um
 
03:04:31.030 --> 03:04:31.040 align:start position:0%
because the push you know the squeaky
 
03:04:32.710 --> 03:04:32.720 align:start position:0%
wheel kind of makes some things happen
 
03:04:35.830 --> 03:04:35.840 align:start position:0%
so okay
 
03:04:38.150 --> 03:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
any further questions just on the
 
03:04:41.269 --> 03:04:41.279 align:start position:0%
capital budget process
 
03:04:43.269 --> 03:04:43.279 align:start position:0%
seeing them thank you very much mr shea
 
03:04:44.950 --> 03:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
we it's appreciated
 
03:04:47.190 --> 03:04:47.200 align:start position:0%
i'm sure we will be asking you for more
 
03:04:49.269 --> 03:04:49.279 align:start position:0%
information along the way
 
03:04:51.190 --> 03:04:51.200 align:start position:0%
not a problem and and in the document
 
03:04:52.870 --> 03:04:52.880 align:start position:0%
you my email's there just go to our

so if you have any it doesn't even have
 
03:05:01.590 --> 03:05:01.600 align:start position:0%
to relate to the capital budget if it's
 
03:05:03.510 --> 03:05:03.520 align:start position:0%

03:06:02.230 --> 03:06:02.240 align:start position:0%
questions in the future
 
03:06:04.630 --> 03:06:04.640 align:start position:0%
as we get the capital budget but this is
 
03:06:06.230 --> 03:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
a good time to start
 
03:06:08.630 --> 03:06:08.640 align:start position:0%
just so one you get to know us and we
 
03:06:11.590 --> 03:06:11.600 align:start position:0%

03:06:22.309 --> 03:06:22.319 align:start position:0%
opportunities for us to um to go over
 
03:06:22.319 --> 03:06:22.710 align:start position:0%
opportunities for us to um to go over
this

03:06:22.710 --> 03:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:06:25.269 --> 03:06:25.279 align:start position:0%
and and to talk in the future once um
 
03:06:27.190 --> 03:06:27.200 align:start position:0%
the capital budget isn't
 
03:06:30.230 --> 03:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
um you know as a full uh force and
 
03:06:31.910 --> 03:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
trying to implement one for for the
 
03:06:33.269 --> 03:06:33.279 align:start position:0%
biennium um
 
03:06:35.429 --> 03:06:35.439 align:start position:0%
so first what i would like to um just
 
03:06:36.950 --> 03:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
mention is um
 
03:06:39.190 --> 03:06:39.200 align:start position:0%
the chief deputy treasurer regime miller
 
03:06:40.309 --> 03:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
is also on
 
03:06:43.510 --> 03:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
and um i just asked her to stay
 
03:06:46.230 --> 03:06:46.240 align:start position:0%
um by just in case um there are
 
03:06:48.550 --> 03:06:48.560 align:start position:0%
questions that the committee may have
 
03:06:51.349 --> 03:06:51.359 align:start position:0%
and um you know that way uh if there's
 
03:06:52.230 --> 03:06:52.240 align:start position:0%
something i can
 
03:06:53.510 --> 03:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
you know as i go through the
 
03:06:56.230 --> 03:06:56.240 align:start position:0%
presentation um
 
03:06:58.150 --> 03:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
you know she might be able to rescue me
 
03:06:59.590 --> 03:06:59.600 align:start position:0%
um rachel has
 
03:07:03.590 --> 03:07:03.600 align:start position:0%
um vast experience in capital budget and
 
03:07:06.870 --> 03:07:06.880 align:start position:0%
bonding um so that's why i asked her to
 
03:07:09.429 --> 03:07:09.439 align:start position:0%
join me today so um if
 
03:07:12.230 --> 03:07:12.240 align:start position:0%

03:07:13.910 --> 03:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
brad is able to bring it on that would
 
03:07:15.510 --> 03:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
be wonderful
 
03:07:18.710 --> 03:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
brad can you bring her up
 
03:07:20.309 --> 03:07:20.319 align:start position:0%

03:07:25.750 --> 03:07:25.760 align:start position:0%
okay you're done
 
03:07:29.429 --> 03:07:29.439 align:start position:0%
very good um so i see she is
 
03:07:32.150 --> 03:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
she's coming okay so what i would like
 
03:07:33.269 --> 03:07:33.279 align:start position:0%
to do today
 
03:07:36.870 --> 03:07:36.880 align:start position:0%
is um mr chairman asked me
 
03:07:39.510 --> 03:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
to you know provide you with an overview
 
03:07:39.520 --> 03:07:40.630 align:start position:0%
to you know provide you with an overview
of

03:07:40.630 --> 03:07:40.640 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:07:43.990 --> 03:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
essentially how we determine um what we
 
03:07:46.150 --> 03:07:46.160 align:start position:0%
recommend what treasurer recommends for
 
03:07:48.389 --> 03:07:48.399 align:start position:0%
capital budget and some of the tools
 
03:07:49.590 --> 03:07:49.600 align:start position:0%
that we use to
 
03:07:52.630 --> 03:07:52.640 align:start position:0%
determine that affordability so i would
 
03:07:55.190 --> 03:07:55.200 align:start position:0%
like to share my screen today i have a
 
03:07:56.870 --> 03:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
presentation that i just put together
 
03:07:58.790 --> 03:07:58.800 align:start position:0%
just so you can see a few
 
03:08:00.389 --> 03:08:00.399 align:start position:0%
you know some of the comments that i
 
03:08:01.910 --> 03:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
would um
 
03:08:03.750 --> 03:08:03.760 align:start position:0%
that i would like to share with you so
 
03:08:05.750 --> 03:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
if you can just
 
03:08:18.309 --> 03:08:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:32.830 --> 03:08:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:32.840 --> 03:08:37.670 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:08:37.670 --> 03:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:41.429 --> 03:08:41.439 align:start position:0%
um okay i'm not familiar with this view
 
03:08:44.950 --> 03:08:44.960 align:start position:0%
are you able to see the slide right now
 
03:08:48.389 --> 03:08:48.399 align:start position:0%
absolutely looks good great
 
03:08:51.750 --> 03:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
yeah very good so
 
03:08:55.590 --> 03:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
um you know again i mean my my objective
 
03:08:57.590 --> 03:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
today is to try to answer those
 
03:09:00.870 --> 03:09:00.880 align:start position:0%
three basic questions that were um
 
03:09:03.110 --> 03:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
mr chairman asked me to to provide how
 
03:09:04.469 --> 03:09:04.479 align:start position:0%
we determine the amount that we
 
03:09:04.479 --> 03:09:05.590 align:start position:0%
we determine the amount that we
recommend

03:09:05.590 --> 03:09:05.600 align:start position:0%
recommend
 
03:09:09.030 --> 03:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
and um you know the process that
 
03:09:11.190 --> 03:09:11.200 align:start position:0%
we go through to determine uh debt
 
03:09:11.200 --> 03:09:12.309 align:start position:0%
we go through to determine uh debt
affordability

03:09:12.309 --> 03:09:12.319 align:start position:0%
affordability
 
03:09:14.550 --> 03:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
and how we calculate those um you know
 
03:09:15.990 --> 03:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
that metrics that help us
 
03:09:18.950 --> 03:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
evaluate uh data affordability for the
 
03:09:18.960 --> 03:09:19.429 align:start position:0%
evaluate uh data affordability for the
state

03:09:19.429 --> 03:09:19.439 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:09:23.670 --> 03:09:23.680 align:start position:0%
so um essentially there are two
 
03:09:26.550 --> 03:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
two two methods that we use two tools uh
 
03:09:28.309 --> 03:09:28.319 align:start position:0%
two way to verify
 
03:09:31.110 --> 03:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
our data affordability and the first one
 
03:09:31.120 --> 03:09:31.830 align:start position:0%
our data affordability and the first one
is

03:09:31.830 --> 03:09:31.840 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:09:34.389 --> 03:09:34.399 align:start position:0%
we prepared a debt affordability study
 
03:09:35.429 --> 03:09:35.439 align:start position:0%
um this
 
03:09:38.870 --> 03:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
this study is prepared by state treasury
 
03:09:40.950 --> 03:09:40.960 align:start position:0%
and also by the state's financial
 
03:09:40.960 --> 03:09:42.630 align:start position:0%
and also by the state's financial
advisor

03:09:42.630 --> 03:09:42.640 align:start position:0%
advisor
 
03:09:46.950 --> 03:09:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:49.670 --> 03:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
we collaborate together to you know
 
03:09:49.680 --> 03:09:50.550 align:start position:0%
we collaborate together to you know
calculate

03:09:50.550 --> 03:09:50.560 align:start position:0%
calculate
 
03:09:54.630 --> 03:09:54.640 align:start position:0%
um key debt metrics that
 
03:09:56.550 --> 03:09:56.560 align:start position:0%
will help us determine whether the
 
03:09:58.070 --> 03:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
state's levels will remain
 
03:10:00.070 --> 03:10:00.080 align:start position:0%
manageable over the course of several
 
03:10:00.080 --> 03:10:01.190 align:start position:0%
manageable over the course of several
years

03:10:01.190 --> 03:10:01.200 align:start position:0%
years
 
03:10:03.269 --> 03:10:03.279 align:start position:0%
um you know the key the key that metrics
 
03:10:05.429 --> 03:10:05.439 align:start position:0%
are debt to personal income
 
03:10:08.790 --> 03:10:08.800 align:start position:0%
uh total net debt per capita
 
03:10:10.469 --> 03:10:10.479 align:start position:0%
net debt service to general fund
 
03:10:12.550 --> 03:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
revenues and
 
03:10:15.190 --> 03:10:15.200 align:start position:0%
the key the key metric that we that we
 
03:10:15.200 --> 03:10:15.750 align:start position:0%
the key the key metric that we that we
use

03:10:15.750 --> 03:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
use
 
03:10:19.110 --> 03:10:19.120 align:start position:0%
is the debt to revenue ratio
 
03:10:21.349 --> 03:10:21.359 align:start position:0%
you know the rating the rating agencies
 
03:10:24.630 --> 03:10:24.640 align:start position:0%
use that ratio to measure
 
03:10:28.309 --> 03:10:28.319 align:start position:0%
whether uh issuers uh have excessive
 
03:10:28.319 --> 03:10:28.870 align:start position:0%
whether uh issuers uh have excessive
debt

03:10:28.870 --> 03:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
debt
 
03:10:31.269 --> 03:10:31.279 align:start position:0%
service and so how if they're able to
 
03:10:33.190 --> 03:10:33.200 align:start position:0%
manage that debt service
 
03:10:35.830 --> 03:10:35.840 align:start position:0%
so i'll go into more detail in a moment
 
03:10:37.590 --> 03:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
so i just want to describe the second
 
03:10:40.389 --> 03:10:40.399 align:start position:0%
method the second method is in statute
 
03:10:42.550 --> 03:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
is a debt limit calculation prescribed
 
03:10:45.429 --> 03:10:45.439 align:start position:0%
in rsa 6-c
 
03:10:48.389 --> 03:10:48.399 align:start position:0%
colon 2 and this law prohibits the
 
03:10:50.469 --> 03:10:50.479 align:start position:0%
legislature from authorizing any
 
03:10:50.479 --> 03:10:51.429 align:start position:0%
legislature from authorizing any
additional

03:10:51.429 --> 03:10:51.439 align:start position:0%
additional
 
03:10:53.990 --> 03:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
net tax supported debt or debt paid with
 
03:10:55.269 --> 03:10:55.279 align:start position:0%
general funds
 
03:10:57.750 --> 03:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
funds that will result in actual and
 
03:10:58.630 --> 03:10:58.640 align:start position:0%
projected debt
 
03:11:01.110 --> 03:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
service exceeding 10 percent of
 
03:11:01.120 --> 03:11:01.990 align:start position:0%
service exceeding 10 percent of
unrestricted

03:11:01.990 --> 03:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
unrestricted
 
03:11:05.190 --> 03:11:05.200 align:start position:0%
general fund revenue typically the
 
03:11:07.990 --> 03:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
results of this calculation are
 
03:11:10.950 --> 03:11:10.960 align:start position:0%
higher is there's a higher cap that the
 
03:11:12.469 --> 03:11:12.479 align:start position:0%
one that we recommend through the data
 
03:11:13.990 --> 03:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
affordability study
 
03:11:16.229 --> 03:11:16.239 align:start position:0%
but this is this is certainly something
 
03:11:18.309 --> 03:11:18.319 align:start position:0%
that is
 
03:11:21.429 --> 03:11:21.439 align:start position:0%
formalized in statute and it's a way to
 
03:11:23.190 --> 03:11:23.200 align:start position:0%
this limit serves as a guide rail to
 
03:11:25.830 --> 03:11:25.840 align:start position:0%
prevent excessive borrowing
 
03:11:27.910 --> 03:11:27.920 align:start position:0%
so now i'm going to go into more detail
 
03:11:28.950 --> 03:11:28.960 align:start position:0%
to try to explain
 
03:11:32.070 --> 03:11:32.080 align:start position:0%
um you know those two tools that we use
 
03:11:34.389 --> 03:11:34.399 align:start position:0%
um the first one is a data affordability
 
03:11:35.990 --> 03:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
study and that's the one that we use the
 
03:11:36.000 --> 03:11:36.950 align:start position:0%
study and that's the one that we use the
most

03:11:36.950 --> 03:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
most
 
03:11:40.630 --> 03:11:40.640 align:start position:0%
um the data for this this um
 
03:11:43.990 --> 03:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
chart is just um it's a snapshot or an
 
03:11:45.349 --> 03:11:45.359 align:start position:0%
easy way to
 
03:11:47.510 --> 03:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
to review uh the data affordability that
 
03:11:48.469 --> 03:11:48.479 align:start position:0%
we publish
 
03:11:51.269 --> 03:11:51.279 align:start position:0%
every year so the latest the the last
 
03:11:53.670 --> 03:11:53.680 align:start position:0%
one we did was the fiscal year 19 we're
 
03:11:53.680 --> 03:11:54.309 align:start position:0%
one we did was the fiscal year 19 we're
about

03:11:54.309 --> 03:11:54.319 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:11:57.590 --> 03:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
we're about to um we're in the process
 
03:11:59.750 --> 03:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
to to work on the and the new one we
 
03:12:02.070 --> 03:12:02.080 align:start position:0%
expect to issue that over the next few
 
03:12:02.080 --> 03:12:02.790 align:start position:0%
expect to issue that over the next few
weeks

03:12:02.790 --> 03:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
weeks
 
03:12:04.389 --> 03:12:04.399 align:start position:0%
and that way you'll have that by the
 
03:12:05.910 --> 03:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
time the capital budget is
 
03:12:09.030 --> 03:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
um is introduced so what you see on the
 
03:12:09.910 --> 03:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
screen right now
 
03:12:12.950 --> 03:12:12.960 align:start position:0%
is um is
 
03:12:14.550 --> 03:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
essentially the results of the data
 
03:12:15.990 --> 03:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
affordability study
 
03:12:19.590 --> 03:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
and it provides um the metrics that i
 
03:12:23.190 --> 03:12:23.200 align:start position:0%
was just describing the first one
 
03:12:25.349 --> 03:12:25.359 align:start position:0%
at the top of the top of the chart is is
 
03:12:26.550 --> 03:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
showing our
 
03:12:29.190 --> 03:12:29.200 align:start position:0%
general fund debt meaning the debt that
 
03:12:30.790 --> 03:12:30.800 align:start position:0%
is paid with general funds and that's
 
03:12:31.990 --> 03:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
that's the key
 
03:12:34.870 --> 03:12:34.880 align:start position:0%
that drives um the debt to revenue
 
03:12:36.790 --> 03:12:36.800 align:start position:0%
ratios that we calculate
 
03:12:39.830 --> 03:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
uh for this for this study
 
03:12:43.429 --> 03:12:43.439 align:start position:0%
the second ratio is net debt to personal
 
03:12:43.439 --> 03:12:44.309 align:start position:0%
the second ratio is net debt to personal
income

03:12:44.309 --> 03:12:44.319 align:start position:0%
income
 
03:12:48.469 --> 03:12:48.479 align:start position:0%
the personal income is obtained from
 
03:12:48.479 --> 03:12:51.670 align:start position:0%
the personal income is obtained from
um

03:12:51.670 --> 03:12:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:53.750 --> 03:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
from the bureau of economic analysis and
 
03:12:55.750 --> 03:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
the data that was used there was
 
03:13:00.070 --> 03:13:00.080 align:start position:0%
um the data from 2018 so that gives us
 
03:13:02.550 --> 03:13:02.560 align:start position:0%
a debt to a personal income of 0.6
 
03:13:02.560 --> 03:13:04.070 align:start position:0%
a debt to a personal income of 0.6
percent

03:13:04.070 --> 03:13:04.080 align:start position:0%
percent
 
03:13:06.790 --> 03:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
and the other one is the net debt per
 
03:13:06.800 --> 03:13:07.990 align:start position:0%
and the other one is the net debt per
capita

03:13:07.990 --> 03:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
capita
 
03:13:11.670 --> 03:13:11.680 align:start position:0%
also the census the census from 2019
 
03:13:12.950 --> 03:13:12.960 align:start position:0%
gave us information to
 
03:13:15.990 --> 03:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
to to calculate
 
03:13:19.750 --> 03:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
that debt metric and the last one as i
 
03:13:20.550 --> 03:13:20.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned is
 
03:13:22.630 --> 03:13:22.640 align:start position:0%
is the one that we paid the most
 
03:13:23.990 --> 03:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
attention is
 
03:13:27.510 --> 03:13:27.520 align:start position:0%
the debt to revenue ratio um
 
03:13:31.750 --> 03:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
for fiscal year 19 it was 6.4 percent
 
03:13:33.349 --> 03:13:33.359 align:start position:0%
this one is a projected one it's a
 
03:13:35.670 --> 03:13:35.680 align:start position:0%
preliminary um
 
03:13:39.030 --> 03:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
ratio of 6.8
 
03:13:41.910 --> 03:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
uh and the rest are projections that we
 
03:13:41.920 --> 03:13:44.070 align:start position:0%
uh and the rest are projections that we
do

03:13:44.070 --> 03:13:44.080 align:start position:0%
do
 
03:13:46.710 --> 03:13:46.720 align:start position:0%
essentially every year to see how these
 
03:13:49.269 --> 03:13:49.279 align:start position:0%
levels are going to be managed
 
03:13:53.510 --> 03:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:55.190 --> 03:13:55.200 align:start position:0%
so that's what the data affordability
 
03:13:58.630 --> 03:13:58.640 align:start position:0%
study does and what we
 
03:14:01.830 --> 03:14:01.840 align:start position:0%
this is important because
 
03:14:05.190 --> 03:14:05.200 align:start position:0%
the rating agencies is that is a
 
03:14:06.790 --> 03:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
that is the metric that the rating
 
03:14:08.790 --> 03:14:08.800 align:start position:0%
agencies use in order
 
03:14:11.269 --> 03:14:11.279 align:start position:0%
again in order to measure how bond
 
03:14:11.279 --> 03:14:12.389 align:start position:0%
again in order to measure how bond
insurers

03:14:12.389 --> 03:14:12.399 align:start position:0%
insurers
 
03:14:15.670 --> 03:14:15.680 align:start position:0%
um and and states or municipal issues
 
03:14:19.110 --> 03:14:19.120 align:start position:0%
and managing their debt levels that is
 
03:14:22.710 --> 03:14:22.720 align:start position:0%
as city new hampshire is characterized
 
03:14:26.710 --> 03:14:26.720 align:start position:0%
for um having um a structure
 
03:14:30.309 --> 03:14:30.319 align:start position:0%
and and good practices and maintain
 
03:14:34.309 --> 03:14:34.319 align:start position:0%
um low levels of debt
 
03:14:36.469 --> 03:14:36.479 align:start position:0%
so that is important to remember in this
 
03:14:38.790 --> 03:14:38.800 align:start position:0%
study um
 
03:14:41.750 --> 03:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
we recommended one authorization of 120
 
03:14:41.760 --> 03:14:42.550 align:start position:0%
we recommended one authorization of 120
million

03:14:42.550 --> 03:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
million
 
03:14:45.429 --> 03:14:45.439 align:start position:0%
that has been uh recommended for several
 
03:14:45.439 --> 03:14:46.070 align:start position:0%
that has been uh recommended for several
biennia

03:14:46.070 --> 03:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
biennia
 
03:14:49.349 --> 03:14:49.359 align:start position:0%
and and and it's in in and it's a
 
03:14:49.359 --> 03:14:49.990 align:start position:0%
and and and it's in in and it's a
typical

03:14:49.990 --> 03:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
typical
 
03:14:53.510 --> 03:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
calculation that we we use
 
03:14:56.309 --> 03:14:56.319 align:start position:0%
in order to see how the how the ratio is
 
03:14:57.349 --> 03:14:57.359 align:start position:0%
going to perform
 
03:15:00.790 --> 03:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
over several years the um
 
03:15:04.309 --> 03:15:04.319 align:start position:0%
the rating agencies consider 10
 
03:15:07.670 --> 03:15:07.680 align:start position:0%
as a warning level um
 
03:15:10.070 --> 03:15:10.080 align:start position:0%
they don't want bond issues to reach
 
03:15:11.110 --> 03:15:11.120 align:start position:0%
that 10
 
03:15:13.349 --> 03:15:13.359 align:start position:0%
so that's something that we know that
 
03:15:15.110 --> 03:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
this 10 percent is something we don't
 
03:15:16.070 --> 03:15:16.080 align:start position:0%
want to reach
 
03:15:18.469 --> 03:15:18.479 align:start position:0%
and so then the challenge now is to make
 
03:15:20.870 --> 03:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
sure that our ratios are low enough
 
03:15:23.030 --> 03:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
and consistent enough so the rating
 
03:15:24.070 --> 03:15:24.080 align:start position:0%
agencies can
 
03:15:27.510 --> 03:15:27.520 align:start position:0%
um you know this again this is only one
 
03:15:30.870 --> 03:15:30.880 align:start position:0%
one component of what they evaluate but
 
03:15:33.349 --> 03:15:33.359 align:start position:0%
but this is has been a positive
 
03:15:33.359 --> 03:15:34.469 align:start position:0%
but this is has been a positive
component

03:15:34.469 --> 03:15:34.479 align:start position:0%
component
 
03:15:37.429 --> 03:15:37.439 align:start position:0%
of the um of the credit rating that new
 
03:15:39.110 --> 03:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire has received
 
03:15:42.870 --> 03:15:42.880 align:start position:0%
um i guess during um
 
03:15:46.309 --> 03:15:46.319 align:start position:0%
several years so so so this is the ratio
 
03:15:49.190 --> 03:15:49.200 align:start position:0%
that we monitor the most
 
03:15:52.389 --> 03:15:52.399 align:start position:0%
again new hampshire is recognized for
 
03:15:52.399 --> 03:15:52.790 align:start position:0%
again new hampshire is recognized for
having

03:15:52.790 --> 03:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
having
 
03:15:56.070 --> 03:15:56.080 align:start position:0%
a higher wealth level so that's what
 
03:15:59.349 --> 03:15:59.359 align:start position:0%
keeps the other ratios low enough and
 
03:16:01.910 --> 03:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
one way we can compare this is a moody's
 
03:16:01.920 --> 03:16:03.030 align:start position:0%
one way we can compare this is a moody's
median

03:16:03.030 --> 03:16:03.040 align:start position:0%
median
 
03:16:05.910 --> 03:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
we're using here in this in this chart
 
03:16:05.920 --> 03:16:06.870 align:start position:0%
we're using here in this in this chart
um

03:16:06.870 --> 03:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:16:10.070 --> 03:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
the mood is median for 2020
 
03:16:12.229 --> 03:16:12.239 align:start position:0%
for net debt to personal income was two
 
03:16:12.239 --> 03:16:13.349 align:start position:0%
for net debt to personal income was two
percent

03:16:13.349 --> 03:16:13.359 align:start position:0%
percent
 
03:16:16.630 --> 03:16:16.640 align:start position:0%
uh net debt per capita was one thousand
 
03:16:18.229 --> 03:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
seventy one dollars
 
03:16:21.269 --> 03:16:21.279 align:start position:0%
and um and again the debt to revenue
 
03:16:22.469 --> 03:16:22.479 align:start position:0%
ratio for them it was
 
03:16:24.229 --> 03:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
uh three point one percent that's the
 
03:16:27.510 --> 03:16:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:29.030 --> 03:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
moody's uses a different way to
 
03:16:30.790 --> 03:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
calculate this median and
 
03:16:33.590 --> 03:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
and the debt-to-roman ratio but again
 
03:16:34.630 --> 03:16:34.640 align:start position:0%
it's something that
 
03:16:38.150 --> 03:16:38.160 align:start position:0%
is is is recognized as a good standard
 
03:16:39.269 --> 03:16:39.279 align:start position:0%
to keep
 
03:16:42.870 --> 03:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
um so so
 
03:16:45.030 --> 03:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
not going into more details there i want
 
03:16:46.630 --> 03:16:46.640 align:start position:0%
to move to the next
 
03:16:50.790 --> 03:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
um to the next tool that is
 
03:16:54.229 --> 03:16:54.239 align:start position:0%
established in statute and that is
 
03:16:58.070 --> 03:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
the debt limit again prescribe and rsa
 
03:17:02.309 --> 03:17:02.319 align:start position:0%
6.c colon 2. and what this
 
03:17:05.590 --> 03:17:05.600 align:start position:0%
what this law says is that
 
03:17:08.790 --> 03:17:08.800 align:start position:0%
essentially the legislature
 
03:17:12.710 --> 03:17:12.720 align:start position:0%
can't authorize anything that is
 
03:17:15.830 --> 03:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
any additional uh debt
 
03:17:18.070 --> 03:17:18.080 align:start position:0%
that is paid with general funds that
 
03:17:18.950 --> 03:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
will result
 
03:17:21.910 --> 03:17:21.920 align:start position:0%
in actual and projected debt service
 
03:17:22.950 --> 03:17:22.960 align:start position:0%
exceeding 10
 
03:17:25.190 --> 03:17:25.200 align:start position:0%
of unrestricted general fund revenues
 
03:17:26.150 --> 03:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
for the previous
 
03:17:29.750 --> 03:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal year so what this chart does and
 
03:17:31.830 --> 03:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
this is this is the certification so the
 
03:17:31.840 --> 03:17:32.150 align:start position:0%
this is this is the certification so the
law

03:17:32.150 --> 03:17:32.160 align:start position:0%
law
 
03:17:33.750 --> 03:17:33.760 align:start position:0%
also says that the treasurer needs to
 
03:17:35.750 --> 03:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
certify um
 
03:17:38.150 --> 03:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
this amount to the legislative budget
 
03:17:39.510 --> 03:17:39.520 align:start position:0%
assistance so we prepare this
 
03:17:39.520 --> 03:17:40.870 align:start position:0%
assistance so we prepare this
certification

03:17:40.870 --> 03:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
certification
 
03:17:43.910 --> 03:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
every year and this is the last one we
 
03:17:43.920 --> 03:17:44.870 align:start position:0%
every year and this is the last one we
have

03:17:44.870 --> 03:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:17:46.950 --> 03:17:46.960 align:start position:0%
um so what this what this calculation
 
03:17:49.110 --> 03:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
does is is as you can see in the in the
 
03:17:49.120 --> 03:17:49.910 align:start position:0%
does is is as you can see in the in the
columns

03:17:49.910 --> 03:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
columns
 
03:17:53.429 --> 03:17:53.439 align:start position:0%
we're including um the actual
 
03:17:55.670 --> 03:17:55.680 align:start position:0%
and the latest again was uh was last
 
03:17:55.680 --> 03:17:56.710 align:start position:0%
and the latest again was uh was last
year's

03:17:56.710 --> 03:17:56.720 align:start position:0%
year's
 
03:17:59.830 --> 03:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
um we're including the actual uh
 
03:18:03.349 --> 03:18:03.359 align:start position:0%
debt service and we're also including
 
03:18:04.950 --> 03:18:04.960 align:start position:0%
the second column we are include i guess
 
03:18:05.990 --> 03:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
a stir cone
 
03:18:09.830 --> 03:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
we include in um bonds authorized in an
 
03:18:09.840 --> 03:18:11.750 align:start position:0%
we include in um bonds authorized in an
issued

03:18:11.750 --> 03:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
issued
 
03:18:13.990 --> 03:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
and and how we're going to amortize them
 
03:18:15.190 --> 03:18:15.200 align:start position:0%
over time
 
03:18:18.469 --> 03:18:18.479 align:start position:0%
and then we're also including uh
 
03:18:21.269 --> 03:18:21.279 align:start position:0%
debt um there is guaranteed by the state
 
03:18:21.990 --> 03:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
and that is
 
03:18:25.750 --> 03:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
um that is that for example from
 
03:18:28.229 --> 03:18:28.239 align:start position:0%
the business fire finance authority we
 
03:18:29.590 --> 03:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
we have to include
 
03:18:33.510 --> 03:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
um bonds that the state has guaranteed
 
03:18:36.710 --> 03:18:36.720 align:start position:0%
um in case there there's a default there
 
03:18:38.790 --> 03:18:38.800 align:start position:0%
and so then we come to a total and then
 
03:18:40.630 --> 03:18:40.640 align:start position:0%
we compare it to
 
03:18:43.990 --> 03:18:44.000 align:start position:0%
10 of fiscal year 2019
 
03:18:47.510 --> 03:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
general fund and restricted revenues and
 
03:18:50.950 --> 03:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
then the result is
 
03:18:54.309 --> 03:18:54.319 align:start position:0%
um the last column is essentially
 
03:18:57.510 --> 03:18:57.520 align:start position:0%
how much more um the stick
 
03:19:00.630 --> 03:19:00.640 align:start position:0%
authorized according to this statute now
 
03:19:03.590 --> 03:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
the the what this with this chart really
 
03:19:05.990 --> 03:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
the result of this calculation
 
03:19:09.030 --> 03:19:09.040 align:start position:0%
and you can see um in row
 
03:19:12.710 --> 03:19:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:15.269 --> 03:19:15.279 align:start position:0%
what we do is we run projections to
 
03:19:17.590 --> 03:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
arrive to a bond authorization
 
03:19:21.190 --> 03:19:21.200 align:start position:0%
that will result um the result of what
 
03:19:22.229 --> 03:19:22.239 align:start position:0%
it is for that
 
03:19:24.309 --> 03:19:24.319 align:start position:0%
debt service so when we ran those
 
03:19:24.319 --> 03:19:25.670 align:start position:0%
debt service so when we ran those
calculations

03:19:25.670 --> 03:19:25.680 align:start position:0%
calculations
 
03:19:29.190 --> 03:19:29.200 align:start position:0%
um the result was that we
 
03:19:31.830 --> 03:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
that there is a maximum of 600 million
 
03:19:33.590 --> 03:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
that could be authorized
 
03:19:38.710 --> 03:19:38.720 align:start position:0%
um used in this calculation
 
03:19:41.830 --> 03:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
now um so again this is this is
 
03:19:44.550 --> 03:19:44.560 align:start position:0%
um essentially a higher cap that we that
 
03:19:45.510 --> 03:19:45.520 align:start position:0%
what the
 
03:19:49.510 --> 03:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
um that affordability study provides
 
03:19:53.190 --> 03:19:53.200 align:start position:0%
and so one thing i one thing that i did
 
03:19:53.200 --> 03:19:53.510 align:start position:0%
and so one thing i one thing that i did
is

03:19:53.510 --> 03:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:19:56.710 --> 03:19:56.720 align:start position:0%
um and i mentioned that in the bottom of
 
03:20:00.150 --> 03:20:00.160 align:start position:0%
of this chart is if we were to um
 
03:20:02.710 --> 03:20:02.720 align:start position:0%
if we were to enter that 600 million
 
03:20:03.590 --> 03:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
into our
 
03:20:05.670 --> 03:20:05.680 align:start position:0%
calculation our tool that we use for
 
03:20:07.349 --> 03:20:07.359 align:start position:0%
that affordability study
 
03:20:09.190 --> 03:20:09.200 align:start position:0%
um the debt to rental ratio could
 
03:20:10.790 --> 03:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
increase or
 
03:20:14.630 --> 03:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
would increase to approximately um 8.5
 
03:20:14.640 --> 03:20:15.349 align:start position:0%
would increase to approximately um 8.5
to

03:20:15.349 --> 03:20:15.359 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:20:18.469 --> 03:20:18.479 align:start position:0%
something between 8.5 percent to 9.5
 
03:20:18.479 --> 03:20:19.269 align:start position:0%
something between 8.5 percent to 9.5
percent

03:20:19.269 --> 03:20:19.279 align:start position:0%
percent
 
03:20:22.150 --> 03:20:22.160 align:start position:0%
so clearly that will put us too close to
 
03:20:22.160 --> 03:20:22.710 align:start position:0%
so clearly that will put us too close to
the

03:20:22.710 --> 03:20:22.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:20:25.429 --> 03:20:25.439 align:start position:0%
10 maximum that the rating agencies
 
03:20:26.630 --> 03:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
don't want to see
 
03:20:28.710 --> 03:20:28.720 align:start position:0%
so but this is again this is something
 
03:20:30.550 --> 03:20:30.560 align:start position:0%
that is a stellar statute i think this
 
03:20:31.670 --> 03:20:31.680 align:start position:0%
will provide
 
03:20:34.150 --> 03:20:34.160 align:start position:0%
um it does provide a guardrail for
 
03:20:34.160 --> 03:20:34.950 align:start position:0%
um it does provide a guardrail for
excessive

03:20:34.950 --> 03:20:34.960 align:start position:0%
excessive
 
03:20:37.510 --> 03:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
excessive borrowing perhaps that's not
 
03:20:39.030 --> 03:20:39.040 align:start position:0%
something we want to
 
03:20:41.990 --> 03:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
um get to but put it again if it's in
 
03:20:43.990 --> 03:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
statue at least the legislature
 
03:20:47.030 --> 03:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
um can approve more
 
03:20:50.229 --> 03:20:50.239 align:start position:0%
um um you know
 
03:20:52.630 --> 03:20:52.640 align:start position:0%
based on but you know couldn't approve
 
03:20:52.640 --> 03:20:53.510 align:start position:0%
based on but you know couldn't approve
more

03:20:53.510 --> 03:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
more
 
03:20:57.590 --> 03:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
uh you know based on this um
 
03:20:59.590 --> 03:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
we couldn't do more than that what this
 
03:21:01.110 --> 03:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
is calculating
 
03:21:05.349 --> 03:21:05.359 align:start position:0%
um but again we will probably um
 
03:21:06.790 --> 03:21:06.800 align:start position:0%
what we what we use is the data
 
03:21:09.750 --> 03:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
affordability study method methodology
 
03:21:09.760 --> 03:21:10.150 align:start position:0%
affordability study method methodology
um

03:21:10.150 --> 03:21:10.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:21:12.389 --> 03:21:12.399 align:start position:0%
you know to talk to you and to recommend
 
03:21:14.309 --> 03:21:14.319 align:start position:0%
um the bond authorizations for a capital
 
03:21:18.550 --> 03:21:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:21.110 --> 03:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
so um i was trying not to get into too
 
03:21:23.190 --> 03:21:23.200 align:start position:0%
much detail so hopefully i'm not
 
03:21:26.710 --> 03:21:26.720 align:start position:0%
losing you yet um and again i just wanna
 
03:21:27.510 --> 03:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:21:30.870 --> 03:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
based on what i what i was um describing
 
03:21:34.150 --> 03:21:34.160 align:start position:0%
um you know these are the the the bond
 
03:21:35.750 --> 03:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
considerations that this committee will
 
03:21:37.990 --> 03:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
have to um you know decide as as the
 
03:21:38.000 --> 03:21:38.630 align:start position:0%
have to um you know decide as as the
couple

03:21:38.630 --> 03:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
couple
 
03:21:42.710 --> 03:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
budget as being uh reviewed and proposed
 
03:21:45.190 --> 03:21:45.200 align:start position:0%
um so the debt to rubbing a ratio of 10
 
03:21:47.269 --> 03:21:47.279 align:start position:0%
percent again is the warning level
 
03:21:51.030 --> 03:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
that the iranian agencies um monitor
 
03:21:53.670 --> 03:21:53.680 align:start position:0%
and um that is a that is that is the
 
03:21:55.910 --> 03:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
ratio that we monitor and we work
 
03:21:59.349 --> 03:21:59.359 align:start position:0%
uh to make sure that um anything that
 
03:22:01.190 --> 03:22:01.200 align:start position:0%
the treasury will recommend
 
03:22:04.229 --> 03:22:04.239 align:start position:0%
it is it is consistent with what uh
 
03:22:07.510 --> 03:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
treasury hazan um
 
03:22:10.070 --> 03:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
historically and what will make you know
 
03:22:11.110 --> 03:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
what will ensure
 
03:22:13.990 --> 03:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
it will maintain um the rating the
 
03:22:15.990 --> 03:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
career rating that uh new hampshire has
 
03:22:18.830 --> 03:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:21.429 --> 03:22:21.439 align:start position:0%
um this this
 
03:22:25.030 --> 03:22:25.040 align:start position:0%
this slide also shows how um this ratio
 
03:22:28.229 --> 03:22:28.239 align:start position:0%
has performed under the last few years
 
03:22:33.349 --> 03:22:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:36.469 --> 03:22:36.479 align:start position:0%
i guess going into beginning in 2000
 
03:22:41.269 --> 03:22:41.279 align:start position:0%
um 2018 2019
 
03:22:44.309 --> 03:22:44.319 align:start position:0%
um the ratio was declining and this that
 
03:22:44.870 --> 03:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
was due
 
03:22:46.950 --> 03:22:46.960 align:start position:0%
to the revenue performance uh that we
 
03:22:48.790 --> 03:22:48.800 align:start position:0%
were having at that time
 
03:22:51.830 --> 03:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
clearly that changed into end 2020
 
03:22:54.550 --> 03:22:54.560 align:start position:0%
and it will depend on how how soon we
 
03:22:56.550 --> 03:22:56.560 align:start position:0%
control the pandemic to to go back to
 
03:22:56.560 --> 03:22:57.590 align:start position:0%
control the pandemic to to go back to
prepandemo

03:22:57.590 --> 03:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
prepandemo
 
03:23:03.349 --> 03:23:03.359 align:start position:0%
epidemic levels prior to 2017
 
03:23:06.229 --> 03:23:06.239 align:start position:0%
there was this reclassification of the
 
03:23:09.110 --> 03:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
medicaid enhancement tax revenues
 
03:23:11.510 --> 03:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
from restricted revenue from
 
03:23:13.269 --> 03:23:13.279 align:start position:0%
unrestricted revenue to restricted
 
03:23:13.279 --> 03:23:14.070 align:start position:0%
unrestricted revenue to restricted
revenue

03:23:14.070 --> 03:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
03:23:18.229 --> 03:23:18.239 align:start position:0%
and that's what drove the ratio um
 
03:23:22.389 --> 03:23:22.399 align:start position:0%
higher and um the 2020 is
 
03:23:25.030 --> 03:23:25.040 align:start position:0%
is a preliminary ratio again i was i was
 
03:23:26.229 --> 03:23:26.239 align:start position:0%
just mentioning that
 
03:23:28.550 --> 03:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
we're in the process to to confirm if
 
03:23:31.190 --> 03:23:31.200 align:start position:0%
that's going to be the ratio based on
 
03:23:34.469 --> 03:23:34.479 align:start position:0%
the revenues the other revenues that we
 
03:23:34.479 --> 03:23:35.590 align:start position:0%
the revenues the other revenues that we
have

03:23:35.590 --> 03:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:23:39.590 --> 03:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
for fiscal year 20 and now we have to um
 
03:23:41.750 --> 03:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
the job is going to be to to try to
 
03:23:43.510 --> 03:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
determine some assumptions
 
03:23:45.750 --> 03:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
of how the revenue is going to perform
 
03:23:47.670 --> 03:23:47.680 align:start position:0%
um in the next few years
 
03:23:51.349 --> 03:23:51.359 align:start position:0%
so we just we just typically um
 
03:23:53.910 --> 03:23:53.920 align:start position:0%
prepare that and that's what um that's
 
03:23:55.830 --> 03:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
what we feed into the methodology
 
03:24:00.389 --> 03:24:00.399 align:start position:0%
and and that's what we'll calculate um
 
03:24:02.469 --> 03:24:02.479 align:start position:0%
the new ratio and and to be able to
 
03:24:06.070 --> 03:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:09.349 --> 03:24:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:11.750 --> 03:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
again another point i want to make is um
 
03:24:11.760 --> 03:24:14.389 align:start position:0%
again another point i want to make is um
it's

03:24:14.389 --> 03:24:14.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:16.309 --> 03:24:16.319 align:start position:0%
some of the consideration so we work
 
03:24:18.229 --> 03:24:18.239 align:start position:0%
really closely with the rating agencies
 
03:24:18.239 --> 03:24:18.950 align:start position:0%
really closely with the rating agencies
um

03:24:18.950 --> 03:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:24:20.870 --> 03:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
when we issue bonds we work really
 
03:24:22.710 --> 03:24:22.720 align:start position:0%
closely with them to make sure we
 
03:24:24.630 --> 03:24:24.640 align:start position:0%
provide them with information they need
 
03:24:24.640 --> 03:24:25.349 align:start position:0%
provide them with information they need
to

03:24:25.349 --> 03:24:25.359 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:24:27.910 --> 03:24:27.920 align:start position:0%
to to to better assess the state the
 
03:24:29.910 --> 03:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
financial health of the state and so we
 
03:24:29.920 --> 03:24:30.630 align:start position:0%
financial health of the state and so we
can

03:24:30.630 --> 03:24:30.640 align:start position:0%
can
 
03:24:33.910 --> 03:24:33.920 align:start position:0%
um you know our goal will be doing to um
 
03:24:37.110 --> 03:24:37.120 align:start position:0%
you know improve our creating writing um
 
03:24:40.790 --> 03:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
uh but again right now we do have um
 
03:24:43.110 --> 03:24:43.120 align:start position:0%
good ratings and that's what allows us
 
03:24:43.990 --> 03:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
to to
 
03:24:47.990 --> 03:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
um to maintain
 
03:24:50.469 --> 03:24:50.479 align:start position:0%
lower costs for our general obligation
 
03:24:50.479 --> 03:24:51.349 align:start position:0%
lower costs for our general obligation
bonds

03:24:51.349 --> 03:24:51.359 align:start position:0%
bonds
 
03:24:55.830 --> 03:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
and so again um the the query rating is
 
03:24:55.840 --> 03:24:56.150 align:start position:0%
and so again um the the query rating is
what

03:24:56.150 --> 03:24:56.160 align:start position:0%
what
 
03:24:59.510 --> 03:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
influences the um you know the borrowing
 
03:25:00.229 --> 03:25:00.239 align:start position:0%
costs uh
 
03:25:03.670 --> 03:25:03.680 align:start position:0%
you know the better our ratings are um
 
03:25:06.309 --> 03:25:06.319 align:start position:0%
obviously the cost will will decrease
 
03:25:08.070 --> 03:25:08.080 align:start position:0%
our yields will be um
 
03:25:09.190 --> 03:25:09.200 align:start position:0%
you know our bonds will be more
 
03:25:11.910 --> 03:25:11.920 align:start position:0%
competitive and and
 
03:25:14.550 --> 03:25:14.560 align:start position:0%
we could have 10 um lower yields uh for
 
03:25:15.910 --> 03:25:15.920 align:start position:0%
our borrowing
 
03:25:19.510 --> 03:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
um rating agencies um
 
03:25:22.710 --> 03:25:22.720 align:start position:0%
focus you know they they have they focus
 
03:25:24.630 --> 03:25:24.640 align:start position:0%
on a variety of components
 
03:25:26.790 --> 03:25:26.800 align:start position:0%
the rainy um the balance and the rainy
 
03:25:28.870 --> 03:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
day fund they focus on
 
03:25:31.510 --> 03:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
the structural budget um and the
 
03:25:33.910 --> 03:25:33.920 align:start position:0%
flexibility that states have
 
03:25:37.110 --> 03:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
to control expenditures um they've been
 
03:25:39.910 --> 03:25:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:43.110 --> 03:25:43.120 align:start position:0%
the state's obligations such as medicaid
 
03:25:46.309 --> 03:25:46.319 align:start position:0%
increases in medicaid spending pension
 
03:25:49.990 --> 03:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
and post-employment liabilities um
 
03:25:51.510 --> 03:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
all of that because they're concerned
 
03:25:53.510 --> 03:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
that that could create um
 
03:25:55.910 --> 03:25:55.920 align:start position:0%
additional fiscal pressures uh for the
 
03:25:55.920 --> 03:25:56.870 align:start position:0%
additional fiscal pressures uh for the
state

03:25:56.870 --> 03:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:25:59.590 --> 03:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
so one way to to you know so so there
 
03:26:00.309 --> 03:26:00.319 align:start position:0%
are so many
 
03:26:03.830 --> 03:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
uh components that are not you know
 
03:26:05.990 --> 03:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
they're difficult to control but there's
 
03:26:07.910 --> 03:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
the debt the debt levels is something
 
03:26:09.429 --> 03:26:09.439 align:start position:0%
the state can control
 
03:26:12.389 --> 03:26:12.399 align:start position:0%
and that is and that is why um you know
 
03:26:13.590 --> 03:26:13.600 align:start position:0%
it's important to maintain that
 
03:26:13.600 --> 03:26:14.550 align:start position:0%
it's important to maintain that
discipline

03:26:14.550 --> 03:26:14.560 align:start position:0%
discipline
 
03:26:19.269 --> 03:26:19.279 align:start position:0%
if we want to continue having that um
 
03:26:21.990 --> 03:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
having that good positive or you know
 
03:26:22.000 --> 03:26:22.630 align:start position:0%
having that good positive or you know
essentially

03:26:22.630 --> 03:26:22.640 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
03:26:25.190 --> 03:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
those good points uh with the rating
 
03:26:25.200 --> 03:26:27.269 align:start position:0%
those good points uh with the rating
agencies

03:26:27.269 --> 03:26:27.279 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
03:26:29.510 --> 03:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
and again the uh you know this this
 
03:26:32.150 --> 03:26:32.160 align:start position:0%
formula and the debt-to-revenue ratio
 
03:26:34.870 --> 03:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
revenues are difficult to to project to
 
03:26:34.880 --> 03:26:35.590 align:start position:0%
revenues are difficult to to project to
estimate

03:26:35.590 --> 03:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
estimate
 
03:26:38.870 --> 03:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
um especially with you know the current
 
03:26:40.870 --> 03:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
situation that we're living right now
 
03:26:43.269 --> 03:26:43.279 align:start position:0%
um but the debt levels are something
 
03:26:45.429 --> 03:26:45.439 align:start position:0%
that we can control we can manage
 
03:26:48.469 --> 03:26:48.479 align:start position:0%
and and that perhaps you know
 
03:26:50.870 --> 03:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
will help us continue with with the
 
03:26:53.830 --> 03:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
financial health that new hampshire is
 
03:26:57.510 --> 03:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
known for and
 
03:27:01.510 --> 03:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
um and the last point um i want to make
 
03:27:01.520 --> 03:27:02.389 align:start position:0%
um and the last point um i want to make
is

03:27:02.389 --> 03:27:02.399 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:27:05.349 --> 03:27:05.359 align:start position:0%
um it is important to to to maintain
 
03:27:07.269 --> 03:27:07.279 align:start position:0%
also borrowing capacity and this
 
03:27:09.269 --> 03:27:09.279 align:start position:0%
is this is in the event of having
 
03:27:11.429 --> 03:27:11.439 align:start position:0%
unanticipated capital needs
 
03:27:14.389 --> 03:27:14.399 align:start position:0%
um you know for example the conquer
 
03:27:16.229 --> 03:27:16.239 align:start position:0%
steam project
 
03:27:19.830 --> 03:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
that happened a few years ago the fifa's
 
03:27:22.229 --> 03:27:22.239 align:start position:0%
remediation project
 
03:27:24.309 --> 03:27:24.319 align:start position:0%
additional 50 million was authorized
 
03:27:26.309 --> 03:27:26.319 align:start position:0%
last year
 
03:27:28.309 --> 03:27:28.319 align:start position:0%
so the recommendations that we will
 
03:27:29.750 --> 03:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
provide to you
 
03:27:32.630 --> 03:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
will probably look about the same and
 
03:27:32.640 --> 03:27:33.269 align:start position:0%
will probably look about the same and
and

03:27:33.269 --> 03:27:33.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:27:34.790 --> 03:27:34.800 align:start position:0%
and the committee will have to decide
 
03:27:36.389 --> 03:27:36.399 align:start position:0%
and obviously the legislature will have
 
03:27:37.670 --> 03:27:37.680 align:start position:0%
to decide
 
03:27:39.349 --> 03:27:39.359 align:start position:0%
you know the the other matters are
 
03:27:40.950 --> 03:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
important um
 
03:27:44.389 --> 03:27:44.399 align:start position:0%
that um you know perhaps have
 
03:27:46.790 --> 03:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
knowing that there is um additional bull
 
03:27:48.309 --> 03:27:48.319 align:start position:0%
run capacity
 
03:27:51.429 --> 03:27:51.439 align:start position:0%
you know perhaps that will um
 
03:27:53.830 --> 03:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
help you determine one of the projects
 
03:27:56.870 --> 03:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:00.389 --> 03:28:00.399 align:start position:0%
and that is what i have today um
 
03:28:02.790 --> 03:28:02.800 align:start position:0%
hopefully i didn't lose you as i was
 
03:28:02.800 --> 03:28:03.830 align:start position:0%
hopefully i didn't lose you as i was
going

03:28:03.830 --> 03:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
going
 
03:28:07.030 --> 03:28:07.040 align:start position:0%
um the last page of my presentation
 
03:28:09.590 --> 03:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
is um you know some of the resources
 
03:28:10.469 --> 03:28:10.479 align:start position:0%
that that
 
03:28:14.229 --> 03:28:14.239 align:start position:0%
we have i was also um
 
03:28:17.269 --> 03:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
um mr chair was
 
03:28:19.510 --> 03:28:19.520 align:start position:0%
was mentioning that um we have the
 
03:28:21.590 --> 03:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
official statements we do have plenty of
 
03:28:24.630 --> 03:28:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:26.309 --> 03:28:26.319 align:start position:0%
physical books that we could share with
 
03:28:28.309 --> 03:28:28.319 align:start position:0%
you but in the meantime
 
03:28:33.110 --> 03:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
we have these books posted online
 
03:28:36.150 --> 03:28:36.160 align:start position:0%
that is the the link that will take you
 
03:28:37.670 --> 03:28:37.680 align:start position:0%
there on our website
 
03:28:39.750 --> 03:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
and so we have the official statements
 
03:28:41.670 --> 03:28:41.680 align:start position:0%
and supplemental disclosures
 
03:28:45.110 --> 03:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
we have the debt affordability studies
 
03:28:47.110 --> 03:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
for the last several years and as well
 
03:28:49.510 --> 03:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
as the debt limit certification that we
 
03:28:52.150 --> 03:28:52.160 align:start position:0%
submit to the lba and we also have a
 
03:28:54.229 --> 03:28:54.239 align:start position:0%
treasury dashboard my predecessor
 
03:28:56.389 --> 03:28:56.399 align:start position:0%
created a treasure dashboard and that
 
03:28:56.399 --> 03:28:57.510 align:start position:0%
created a treasure dashboard and that
dashboard

03:28:57.510 --> 03:28:57.520 align:start position:0%
dashboard
 
03:29:00.950 --> 03:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
um includes um several
 
03:29:03.670 --> 03:29:03.680 align:start position:0%
metrics that we track in the treasury
 
03:29:04.870 --> 03:29:04.880 align:start position:0%
you know in the event that you want to
 
03:29:06.389 --> 03:29:06.399 align:start position:0%
look at something
 
03:29:09.910 --> 03:29:09.920 align:start position:0%
quickly and so that completes my
 
03:29:09.920 --> 03:29:10.790 align:start position:0%
quickly and so that completes my
presentation

03:29:10.790 --> 03:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
03:29:14.309 --> 03:29:14.319 align:start position:0%
i'm going to try to um stop sharing my
 
03:29:14.319 --> 03:29:14.790 align:start position:0%
i'm going to try to um stop sharing my
screen

03:29:14.790 --> 03:29:14.800 align:start position:0%
screen
 
03:29:17.910 --> 03:29:17.920 align:start position:0%
so i can ask any questions the community
 
03:29:22.229 --> 03:29:22.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:24.630 --> 03:29:24.640 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mountain treasure
 
03:29:26.150 --> 03:29:26.160 align:start position:0%
it's informative
 
03:29:28.070 --> 03:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
if you have questions please raise your
 
03:29:29.990 --> 03:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
hand but i would ask that you
 
03:29:32.630 --> 03:29:32.640 align:start position:0%
not ask the treasurer what the dollar
 
03:29:34.469 --> 03:29:34.479 align:start position:0%
amount is going to be for the coming
 
03:29:35.590 --> 03:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
capital budget
 
03:29:37.910 --> 03:29:37.920 align:start position:0%
she's still refining that she's still
 
03:29:39.910 --> 03:29:39.920 align:start position:0%
working with the governor's office on
 
03:29:39.920 --> 03:29:40.710 align:start position:0%
working with the governor's office on
that

03:29:40.710 --> 03:29:40.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:29:43.590 --> 03:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
um we will hear about that in a month
 
03:29:45.990 --> 03:29:46.000 align:start position:0%
from now or so would we get
 
03:29:48.870 --> 03:29:48.880 align:start position:0%
the capital budget and where she is and
 
03:29:50.550 --> 03:29:50.560 align:start position:0%
what she's refined
 
03:29:53.830 --> 03:29:53.840 align:start position:0%
but um just know that i wanted everybody
 
03:29:55.750 --> 03:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
to know how she developed
 
03:29:57.830 --> 03:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
the debt affordability study where it
 
03:29:58.950 --> 03:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
came from
 
03:30:02.630 --> 03:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
but right now she is in a process
 
03:30:05.510 --> 03:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
with the executive branch to to come up
 
03:30:05.520 --> 03:30:05.990 align:start position:0%
with the executive branch to to come up
with

03:30:05.990 --> 03:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:30:09.190 --> 03:30:09.200 align:start position:0%
with a recommendation to us and
 
03:30:10.870 --> 03:30:10.880 align:start position:0%
that will all be included when the
 
03:30:12.469 --> 03:30:12.479 align:start position:0%
governor gives us
 
03:30:15.429 --> 03:30:15.439 align:start position:0%
his capital budget and what he thinks we
 
03:30:15.990 --> 03:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
should do
 
03:30:18.309 --> 03:30:18.319 align:start position:0%
and how much we could spend because
 
03:30:19.910 --> 03:30:19.920 align:start position:0%
whatever she gives us now
 
03:30:23.910 --> 03:30:23.920 align:start position:0%
is going to change at all probability
 
03:30:27.349 --> 03:30:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:31.510 --> 03:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
unmute yeah yes i just wondered that
 
03:30:34.150 --> 03:30:34.160 align:start position:0%
you know i found it very helpful to have
 
03:30:35.910 --> 03:30:35.920 align:start position:0%
that dashboard
 
03:30:37.990 --> 03:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
and i just wondered if you know that
 
03:30:40.070 --> 03:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
could be provided to us
 
03:30:49.110 --> 03:30:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:51.030 --> 03:30:51.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely and there uh right now that's
 
03:30:53.030 --> 03:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
being posted on a monthly basis
 
03:30:55.429 --> 03:30:55.439 align:start position:0%
so um if you if you were like i could
 
03:30:58.150 --> 03:30:58.160 align:start position:0%
even i could study melanity to you
 
03:31:01.590 --> 03:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
the committee you know i will i will um
 
03:31:03.670 --> 03:31:03.680 align:start position:0%
take any suggestions how you want to res
 
03:31:06.150 --> 03:31:06.160 align:start position:0%
if you want to receive an email from me
 
03:31:08.950 --> 03:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
i could do that i can't speak for the
 
03:31:10.790 --> 03:31:10.800 align:start position:0%
rest of the committee but like i said i
 
03:31:13.110 --> 03:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
found it most helpful
 
03:31:16.229 --> 03:31:16.239 align:start position:0%
um what madam treasurer why don't you
 
03:31:18.150 --> 03:31:18.160 align:start position:0%
just send the link to it
 
03:31:20.229 --> 03:31:20.239 align:start position:0%
to the entire community and that way
 
03:31:21.830 --> 03:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
they can if they want to save it they
 
03:31:21.840 --> 03:31:22.389 align:start position:0%
they can if they want to save it they
can

03:31:22.389 --> 03:31:22.399 align:start position:0%
can
 
03:31:24.710 --> 03:31:24.720 align:start position:0%
because it does get updated and they can
 
03:31:27.590 --> 03:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
check on it periodically rather than you
 
03:31:30.469 --> 03:31:30.479 align:start position:0%
having to try to remember to send it out
 
03:31:33.030 --> 03:31:33.040 align:start position:0%
every month or so
 
03:31:34.550 --> 03:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
thank you and again it's posted on the
 
03:31:36.229 --> 03:31:36.239 align:start position:0%
website um and i
 
03:31:38.150 --> 03:31:38.160 align:start position:0%
i'll be happy to share this presentation
 
03:31:40.309 --> 03:31:40.319 align:start position:0%
as well so you can um you know that
 
03:31:40.870 --> 03:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
would be
 
03:31:43.349 --> 03:31:43.359 align:start position:0%
but as a reference if if you would like
 
03:31:45.990 --> 03:31:46.000 align:start position:0%
um to look at it in the future
 
03:31:48.550 --> 03:31:48.560 align:start position:0%
that that would be helpful and and i'm
 
03:31:49.990 --> 03:31:50.000 align:start position:0%

said
 
03:31:57.680 --> 03:32:02.309 align:start position:0%
said

03:32:13.750 --> 03:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
to add that was
 
03:32:17.510 --> 03:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
that was good so thank you thank you
 
03:32:20.790 --> 03:32:20.800 align:start position:0%
representative faulkner yes thank you
 
03:32:24.070 --> 03:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
um last last session we uh we learned
 
03:32:25.910 --> 03:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
that there was some dispute with the
 
03:32:27.269 --> 03:32:27.279 align:start position:0%
rating agencies over
 
03:32:29.990 --> 03:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
how they were uh how they were treating
 
03:32:31.110 --> 03:32:31.120 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
03:32:33.670 --> 03:32:33.680 align:start position:0%
is there still that disagreement or if
 
03:32:37.110 --> 03:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
we resolve those issues
 
03:32:40.229 --> 03:32:40.239 align:start position:0%
um yeah i believe um
 
03:32:43.670 --> 03:32:43.680 align:start position:0%
one of the rating agencies um
 
03:32:45.349 --> 03:32:45.359 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if we'll call it a dispute
 
03:32:45.359 --> 03:32:46.870 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if we'll call it a dispute
but

03:32:46.870 --> 03:32:46.880 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:32:50.070 --> 03:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
perhaps my understanding is
 
03:32:53.269 --> 03:32:53.279 align:start position:0%
uh um one of the reading agencies
 
03:32:56.469 --> 03:32:56.479 align:start position:0%
uh in their description and and and
 
03:32:59.110 --> 03:32:59.120 align:start position:0%
characterization of how the states
 
03:33:02.309 --> 03:33:02.319 align:start position:0%
um this day was performing um
 
03:33:05.349 --> 03:33:05.359 align:start position:0%
perhaps they were using um old
 
03:33:06.550 --> 03:33:06.560 align:start position:0%
information so
 
03:33:09.269 --> 03:33:09.279 align:start position:0%
um we had a meeting with with them in
 
03:33:10.950 --> 03:33:10.960 align:start position:0%
the beginning of the year
 
03:33:13.910 --> 03:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
and um we were able to explain to them
 
03:33:14.950 --> 03:33:14.960 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:33:17.190 --> 03:33:17.200 align:start position:0%
the way we were seeing their evaluations
 
03:33:18.150 --> 03:33:18.160 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:33:20.950 --> 03:33:20.960 align:start position:0%
that with that what that did is um they
 
03:33:20.960 --> 03:33:21.750 align:start position:0%
that with that what that did is um they
revised

03:33:21.750 --> 03:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
revised
 
03:33:25.990 --> 03:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
the way they were um assessing the state
 
03:33:28.790 --> 03:33:28.800 align:start position:0%
uh at the time when um so so it was
 
03:33:30.309 --> 03:33:30.319 align:start position:0%
helpful i think it was a
 
03:33:32.309 --> 03:33:32.319 align:start position:0%
productive feedback that they receive
 
03:33:34.469 --> 03:33:34.479 align:start position:0%
from from us from treasury
 
03:33:37.269 --> 03:33:37.279 align:start position:0%
uh from our predecessor especially and
 
03:33:37.279 --> 03:33:38.790 align:start position:0%
uh from our predecessor especially and
um

03:33:38.790 --> 03:33:38.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:33:42.070 --> 03:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
when the estate issue bonds in march
 
03:33:45.590 --> 03:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
of last year um this
 
03:33:48.630 --> 03:33:48.640 align:start position:0%
this rating agency smp upgraded the
 
03:33:48.640 --> 03:33:49.269 align:start position:0%
this rating agency smp upgraded the
state

03:33:49.269 --> 03:33:49.279 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:33:52.389 --> 03:33:52.399 align:start position:0%
um the outlook um the outlook of the
 
03:33:55.269 --> 03:33:55.279 align:start position:0%
state change from stable to positive
 
03:33:58.150 --> 03:33:58.160 align:start position:0%
so i think it was very helpful to to to
 
03:33:59.269 --> 03:33:59.279 align:start position:0%
explain to them
 
03:34:01.030 --> 03:34:01.040 align:start position:0%
that perhaps they were seeing the way
 
03:34:03.190 --> 03:34:03.200 align:start position:0%
they were characterizing the state
 
03:34:07.030 --> 03:34:07.040 align:start position:0%
was not um as accurate as
 
03:34:10.389 --> 03:34:10.399 align:start position:0%
as it should have been um unfortunately
 
03:34:11.990 --> 03:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the beginning of this you
 
03:34:13.590 --> 03:34:13.600 align:start position:0%
know in the beginning of the pandemic
 
03:34:15.590 --> 03:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
what that did is it allowed us to go
 
03:34:17.110 --> 03:34:17.120 align:start position:0%
back to stable
 
03:34:19.349 --> 03:34:19.359 align:start position:0%
uh when the pandemic started s p changed
 
03:34:20.630 --> 03:34:20.640 align:start position:0%
the look of
 
03:34:22.790 --> 03:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
the entire public sector including the
 
03:34:25.030 --> 03:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
state and it had nothing to do with
 
03:34:26.950 --> 03:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
the performance of the state it really
 
03:34:28.710 --> 03:34:28.720 align:start position:0%
had to do with
 
03:34:31.990 --> 03:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
uh how they were seeing um
 
03:34:33.910 --> 03:34:33.920 align:start position:0%
the economy at that time and the
 
03:34:35.429 --> 03:34:35.439 align:start position:0%
difficulties that the pandemic was
 
03:34:35.439 --> 03:34:36.550 align:start position:0%
difficulties that the pandemic was
presenting

03:34:36.550 --> 03:34:36.560 align:start position:0%
presenting
 
03:34:38.469 --> 03:34:38.479 align:start position:0%
and how they were able to see that the
 
03:34:39.990 --> 03:34:40.000 align:start position:0%
states were going to have
 
03:34:43.110 --> 03:34:43.120 align:start position:0%
a challenge meeting revenue performance
 
03:34:45.910 --> 03:34:45.920 align:start position:0%
and and all the variety of of challenges
 
03:34:47.190 --> 03:34:47.200 align:start position:0%
that were
 
03:34:50.309 --> 03:34:50.319 align:start position:0%
evident to them at that time um we we
 
03:34:51.269 --> 03:34:51.279 align:start position:0%
sold bonds
 
03:34:55.030 --> 03:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
um just this past december
 
03:34:57.830 --> 03:34:57.840 align:start position:0%
um we did not get an upgrade but the
 
03:35:00.070 --> 03:35:00.080 align:start position:0%
good news is that we kept our ratings
 
03:35:03.510 --> 03:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
and and so again um
 
03:35:06.070 --> 03:35:06.080 align:start position:0%
there in my opinion the way they see the
 
03:35:08.229 --> 03:35:08.239 align:start position:0%
state is is very positive
 
03:35:11.349 --> 03:35:11.359 align:start position:0%
um there were many states that were well
 
03:35:13.349 --> 03:35:13.359 align:start position:0%
perhaps not many but there were states
 
03:35:15.030 --> 03:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
that um
 
03:35:17.750 --> 03:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
had grading challenges and some of them
 
03:35:19.030 --> 03:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
were downgraded
 
03:35:22.229 --> 03:35:22.239 align:start position:0%
um so it was very positive to see that
 
03:35:23.750 --> 03:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
the city of new hampshire maintain those
 
03:35:26.229 --> 03:35:26.239 align:start position:0%
ratings and and we were able to have
 
03:35:29.349 --> 03:35:29.359 align:start position:0%
um in addition to that we we are bond
 
03:35:31.190 --> 03:35:31.200 align:start position:0%
sold very competitively
 
03:35:34.150 --> 03:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
um and and we obtained uh a very low
 
03:35:34.160 --> 03:35:34.950 align:start position:0%
um and and we obtained uh a very low
yield

03:35:34.950 --> 03:35:34.960 align:start position:0%
yield
 
03:35:37.750 --> 03:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
uh of course the market was performing
 
03:35:37.760 --> 03:35:40.229 align:start position:0%
uh of course the market was performing
um

03:35:40.229 --> 03:35:40.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:42.630 --> 03:35:42.640 align:start position:0%
it is the way the market is performing
 
03:35:44.550 --> 03:35:44.560 align:start position:0%
the reason why we also had
 
03:35:47.110 --> 03:35:47.120 align:start position:0%
um you know obtained low yield but but
 
03:35:47.750 --> 03:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
again it's
 
03:35:50.630 --> 03:35:50.640 align:start position:0%
it's important to to uh to recognize
 
03:35:51.910 --> 03:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
that the state is doing a
 
03:35:55.750 --> 03:35:55.760 align:start position:0%
terrific job with the finances
 
03:36:00.469 --> 03:36:00.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:03.590 --> 03:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions
 
03:36:07.190 --> 03:36:07.200 align:start position:0%
representative evil thank you mr
 
03:36:09.990 --> 03:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
chair um thank you very much for the
 
03:36:10.000 --> 03:36:11.030 align:start position:0%
chair um thank you very much for the
presentation

03:36:11.030 --> 03:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
03:36:13.590 --> 03:36:13.600 align:start position:0%
so i i don't have the chart in front of
 
03:36:14.309 --> 03:36:14.319 align:start position:0%
me now
 
03:36:18.070 --> 03:36:18.080 align:start position:0%
but um we all believe and you've said
 
03:36:19.910 --> 03:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire does really well in
 
03:36:21.910 --> 03:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
its debt service ratio
 
03:36:25.349 --> 03:36:25.359 align:start position:0%
and um the thing is what i saw there was
 
03:36:26.550 --> 03:36:26.560 align:start position:0%
that the moody's
 
03:36:30.070 --> 03:36:30.080 align:start position:0%
average net dirt debt service ratio was
 
03:36:31.510 --> 03:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
3.8 percent
 
03:36:35.110 --> 03:36:35.120 align:start position:0%
versus ours being 6.4 6.5
 
03:36:37.269 --> 03:36:37.279 align:start position:0%
i saw the ratio to personal income for
 
03:36:38.870 --> 03:36:38.880 align:start position:0%
new hampshire was much better
 
03:36:42.389 --> 03:36:42.399 align:start position:0%
and also per capita but if it's not too
 
03:36:43.990 --> 03:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
complicated i just
 
03:36:45.670 --> 03:36:45.680 align:start position:0%
i mean there's a big difference between
 
03:36:47.110 --> 03:36:47.120 align:start position:0%
3.8 and
 
03:36:50.710 --> 03:36:50.720 align:start position:0%
point whatever yes and
 
03:36:53.830 --> 03:36:53.840 align:start position:0%
um that that is a great question and and
 
03:36:56.150 --> 03:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
moody's uses a different um way to
 
03:36:56.160 --> 03:36:57.030 align:start position:0%
moody's uses a different um way to
calculate

03:36:57.030 --> 03:36:57.040 align:start position:0%
calculate
 
03:37:00.830 --> 03:37:00.840 align:start position:0%
um their ratio and
 
03:37:04.150 --> 03:37:04.160 align:start position:0%
um i believe i was looking at the report
 
03:37:05.510 --> 03:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
yesterday and i believe
 
03:37:08.870 --> 03:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
what what so the our ratio for moody's
 
03:37:08.880 --> 03:37:09.269 align:start position:0%
what what so the our ratio for moody's
is

03:37:09.269 --> 03:37:09.279 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:37:12.950 --> 03:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
also 3.8 percent what moody's does is
 
03:37:16.229 --> 03:37:16.239 align:start position:0%
uh the reason the ratio is lower
 
03:37:19.910 --> 03:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
is because moody's uh includes um
 
03:37:22.630 --> 03:37:22.640 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund revenue as part
 
03:37:22.640 --> 03:37:23.030 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund revenue as part
of

03:37:23.030 --> 03:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:37:26.389 --> 03:37:26.399 align:start position:0%
um as part of the overall formula
 
03:37:30.070 --> 03:37:30.080 align:start position:0%
so um the other rate the the
 
03:37:32.389 --> 03:37:32.399 align:start position:0%
the typical ratio we we calculate we
 
03:37:33.110 --> 03:37:33.120 align:start position:0%
only use
 
03:37:36.070 --> 03:37:36.080 align:start position:0%
unrestricted revenue but there there
 
03:37:36.080 --> 03:37:36.550 align:start position:0%
unrestricted revenue but there there
they

03:37:36.550 --> 03:37:36.560 align:start position:0%
they
 
03:37:40.389 --> 03:37:40.399 align:start position:0%
include um again the education fund
 
03:37:41.590 --> 03:37:41.600 align:start position:0%
revenue because they believe
 
03:37:43.190 --> 03:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
um you know it's also considered
 
03:37:44.630 --> 03:37:44.640 align:start position:0%
unrestricted revenue
 
03:37:47.429 --> 03:37:47.439 align:start position:0%
even though it's used for education
 
03:37:49.750 --> 03:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
funding but but that is the reason why
 
03:37:54.150 --> 03:37:54.160 align:start position:0%
um moody's calculates the ratio in a
 
03:37:54.950 --> 03:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
different way
 
03:37:57.990 --> 03:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
for all the states and it is
 
03:38:00.870 --> 03:38:00.880 align:start position:0%
3.8 percent um from the last report it's
 
03:38:01.910 --> 03:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
3.8 percent
 
03:38:04.389 --> 03:38:04.399 align:start position:0%
for new hampshire but again the um the
 
03:38:05.990 --> 03:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
overall understanding and
 
03:38:09.429 --> 03:38:09.439 align:start position:0%
how the other rating agencies see um
 
03:38:11.429 --> 03:38:11.439 align:start position:0%
i guess a typical way to calculate their
 
03:38:12.550 --> 03:38:12.560 align:start position:0%
ratio is
 
03:38:17.830 --> 03:38:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:19.910 --> 03:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
i hope that helps yeah thank you very
 
03:38:21.990 --> 03:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
much you're welcome
 
03:38:26.389 --> 03:38:26.399 align:start position:0%

um i appreciate you uh being here today
 
03:39:05.510 --> 03:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
i i know it's not quite the same
 
03:39:07.990 --> 03:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
trying to do it with this platform
 
03:39:10.630 --> 03:39:10.640 align:start position:0%
because you don't get the interaction
 
03:39:13.830 --> 03:39:13.840 align:start position:0%
that we normally would with both
 
03:39:16.790 --> 03:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
the treasurer and each other but i
 
03:39:18.550 --> 03:39:18.560 align:start position:0%
wanted to get us
 
03:39:20.870 --> 03:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
started on the right foot at least
 
03:39:21.990 --> 03:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
thinking about the
 
03:39:25.349 --> 03:39:25.359 align:start position:0%
capital budget that affordability and
 
03:39:26.950 --> 03:39:26.960 align:start position:0%
just a little bit about getting to know
 
03:39:29.349 --> 03:39:29.359 align:start position:0%
each other um
 
03:39:32.630 --> 03:39:32.640 align:start position:0%
they're not being anything i just gotta
 
03:39:34.950 --> 03:39:34.960 align:start position:0%
i have an email from the speaker's
 
03:39:36.950 --> 03:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
office that there's a chairs and vice
 
03:39:38.070 --> 03:39:38.080 align:start position:0%
