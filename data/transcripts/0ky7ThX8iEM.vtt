in a slightly different order than is
 
00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:16.720 align:start position:0%
noticed so if i'm going to go a little
 
00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:18.560 align:start position:0%
slower so everybody can get things
 
00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:20.390 align:start position:0%

from
 
00:07:32.629 --> 00:07:32.639 align:start position:0%

00:07:41.309 --> 00:07:41.319 align:start position:0%
535 538
 
00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:45.800 align:start position:0%
554 429
 
00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:50.800 align:start position:0%
362 508.
 
00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:53.360 align:start position:0%
it is my understanding that as to those
 
00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:54.309 align:start position:0%
it is my understanding that as to those
bills

00:07:54.309 --> 00:07:54.319 align:start position:0%
bills
 
00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:02.560 align:start position:0%
we have a couple of amendments that
 
00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
representative growing has worked on
 
00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:08.080 align:start position:0%

00:08:08.869 --> 00:08:08.879 align:start position:0%

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:12.400 align:start position:0%
introduce is amendment zero
 
00:08:15.749 --> 00:08:15.759 align:start position:0%
seven four three
 
00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:18.800 align:start position:0%
with the is there with the date
 
00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
of march night i have
 
00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:25.120 align:start position:0%
asked that that email be resent
 
00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:27.680 align:start position:0%
this morning because of the email issues
 
00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:29.360 align:start position:0%
this committee is currently having on
 
00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:34.320 align:start position:0%
find anything so
 
00:08:37.509 --> 00:08:37.519 align:start position:0%
if you don't have it in hand
 
00:08:39.509 --> 00:08:39.519 align:start position:0%
the recess if we don't have everybody
 
00:08:41.509 --> 00:08:41.519 align:start position:0%
present we'll allow you an opportunity
 
00:08:43.589 --> 00:08:43.599 align:start position:0%
to get
 
00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
that amendment 7
 
00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:50.720 align:start position:0%
4 3 h
 
00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
i am not aware of any other amendments
 
00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:55.200 align:start position:0%
for the bills i just
 
00:08:57.990 --> 00:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
listed if somebody has an amendment on
 
00:08:59.190 --> 00:08:59.200 align:start position:0%
those bills
 
00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:01.760 align:start position:0%
let's take the great followers take the
 
00:09:03.509 --> 00:09:03.519 align:start position:0%
opportunity of the break to work out
 
00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
electronic issues to
 
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:09.760 align:start position:0%
get those amendments in and then
 
00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
after we vote on the bills that i
 
00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:15.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned before ending with house bill
 
00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.030 align:start position:0%
mentioned before ending with house bill
508

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
508
 
00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
this committee will be taking another
 
00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:21.030 align:start position:0%
this committee will be taking another
recess

00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
recess
 
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:23.440 align:start position:0%
um and i'll determine at that time how
 
00:09:24.389 --> 00:09:24.399 align:start position:0%
long it will be
 
00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
because it is my understanding that
 
00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
while we have
 
00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
in our possession as to sp43
 
00:09:38.949 --> 00:09:38.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:44.080 align:start position:0%
amendment 0639
 
00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:47.440 align:start position:0%
we have been sent amendment 0 6
 
00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:50.720 align:start position:0%
3 each
 
00:09:53.269 --> 00:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
it is my understanding that we also
 
00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
receive some emails
 
00:09:58.230 --> 00:09:58.240 align:start position:0%
from representative growing
 
00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:00.640 align:start position:0%
with an amendment possibly he is not
 
00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
planning on introducing those
 
00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:04.480 align:start position:0%
and it's my understanding there is
 
00:10:05.829 --> 00:10:05.839 align:start position:0%
another amendment
 
00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
for sb 43 that is being
 
00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
finalized right now and we will be
 
00:10:13.509 --> 00:10:13.519 align:start position:0%
taking a break so that all committee
 
00:10:13.519 --> 00:10:14.310 align:start position:0%
taking a break so that all committee
members

00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:14.320 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
have an opportunity to review all the
 
00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:18.160 align:start position:0%
amendments before we
 
00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
reconvene to vote on our last two bills
 
00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:22.160 align:start position:0%
which will be
 
00:10:26.949 --> 00:10:26.959 align:start position:0%
sd2 and sb43
 
00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
um so it is looks to me
 
00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:33.200 align:start position:0%
like we are still missing representative
 
00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:33.990 align:start position:0%
like we are still missing representative
sandler

00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
sandler
 
00:10:37.829 --> 00:10:37.839 align:start position:0%
and representative treatise
 
00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
is that correct it is all right we are
 
00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:42.160 align:start position:0%
going to take a break
 
00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
until 10 25
 
00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:48.160 align:start position:0%
and we will be in recess until that
 
00:10:49.509 --> 00:10:49.519 align:start position:0%
point in time and let's see if we can
 
00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
get that straightened out representative
 
00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:52.630 align:start position:0%
get that straightened out representative
mirrorhead

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
mirrorhead
 
00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
um on a technical issue just during the
 
00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:56.150 align:start position:0%
um on a technical issue just during the
break

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
break
 
00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
i i figured out how to create what's
 
00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
called a rule that directs
 
00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
the incoming flow about sb43 into a
 
00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:04.710 align:start position:0%
the incoming flow about sb43 into a
special

00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:04.720 align:start position:0%
special
 
00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:06.560 align:start position:0%
email box where i can read them all
 
00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:07.750 align:start position:0%
email box where i can read them all
separately

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:07.760 align:start position:0%
separately
 
00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:10.240 align:start position:0%
um and if anyone is you know interested
 
00:11:12.389 --> 00:11:12.399 align:start position:0%
in in that and lots of little uh
 
00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:14.480 align:start position:0%
guidance i'm happy to try to walk you
 
00:11:15.269 --> 00:11:15.279 align:start position:0%
through it
 
00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:18.160 align:start position:0%
it then clears out your inbox um
 
00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:19.590 align:start position:0%
it then clears out your inbox um
automatically

00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
automatically
 
00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:21.440 align:start position:0%
will it deal with the emails that we've
 
00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
already got
 
00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
i'll have to work i'll work on that
 
00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:26.720 align:start position:0%
madam chair i'll see if i can find
 
00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:28.640 align:start position:0%
another rules for that
 
00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
i think everybody would be interested in
 
00:11:32.389 --> 00:11:32.399 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:11:34.949 --> 00:11:34.959 align:start position:0%
because i there is an ongoing issue in
 
00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:36.640 align:start position:0%
my opinion that has existed since the
 
00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
beginning of the session
 
00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
as to email communication because the
 
00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
substance of what we're doing has
 
00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:44.320 align:start position:0%
changed so much um
 
00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that the new rule
 
00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
which was adopted makes a lot of sense
 
00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
and there needs to be some consideration
 
00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
on how we handle this going forward
 
00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
uh representative moorhead i know i and
 
00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:56.150 align:start position:0%
uh representative moorhead i know i and
many

00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:56.160 align:start position:0%

members sitting here today will be
 
00:11:59.670 --> 00:11:59.680 align:start position:0%
interested in
 
00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
getting your hints
 
00:12:08.829 --> 00:12:08.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:08.839 --> 00:14:12.069 align:start position:0%
 
approximately

00:14:12.069 --> 00:14:12.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:13.680 align:start position:0%

while we're addressing technical
 
00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
difficulties you know is your sign in

and representative sandler sign in and
 
00:14:26.069 --> 00:14:26.079 align:start position:0%
so that's why
 
00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
it appears that not much is happening
 
00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
right now but um
 
00:14:33.269 --> 00:14:33.279 align:start position:0%

00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:02.320 align:start position:0%
hb 98 this had a public hearing
 
00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:05.360 align:start position:0%
on january 29th
 
00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:08.480 align:start position:0%
we continued that because during session
 
00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:09.200 align:start position:0%
there was some
 
00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:12.240 align:start position:0%
discussion about possible amendment to

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:39.510 align:start position:0%

representative

00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
yes madam chair hb 98 has filed
 
00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:44.720 align:start position:0%
proposes to move the new hampshire
 
00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:46.720 align:start position:0%
primary from the second tuesday in
 
00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:47.669 align:start position:0%
primary from the second tuesday in
september

00:28:47.669 --> 00:28:47.679 align:start position:0%
september
 
00:28:50.389 --> 00:28:50.399 align:start position:0%
to the first tuesday in june and to move
 
00:28:52.789 --> 00:28:52.799 align:start position:0%
the filing date for candidacy from the
 
00:28:54.389 --> 00:28:54.399 align:start position:0%
first wednesday
 
00:28:57.029 --> 00:28:57.039 align:start position:0%
in june to the first wednesday in march
 
00:28:58.590 --> 00:28:58.600 align:start position:0%
at the hearing for
 
00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:01.360 align:start position:0%
hb-98 concerned the voice that the first
 
00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
tuesday in june
 
00:29:04.389 --> 00:29:04.399 align:start position:0%
would interfere with the last weeks of
 
00:29:06.149 --> 00:29:06.159 align:start position:0%
school particularly where schools are
 
00:29:09.029 --> 00:29:09.039 align:start position:0%
used as voting locations
 
00:29:11.110 --> 00:29:11.120 align:start position:0%
i researched the school calendars of 10
 
00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
of the largest school districts in new
 
00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:14.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire and found that the last day of
 
00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
the school
 
00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
was between the 11th and the 18th of
 
00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:18.230 align:start position:0%
was between the 11th and the 18th of
june

00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:18.240 align:start position:0%
june
 
00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:20.480 align:start position:0%
this amendment will move the primary
 
00:29:22.789 --> 00:29:22.799 align:start position:0%
date to the fourth tuesday of june
 
00:29:24.789 --> 00:29:24.799 align:start position:0%
which puts it outside of the school
 
00:29:27.430 --> 00:29:27.440 align:start position:0%
calendars but still before most families
 
00:29:28.870 --> 00:29:28.880 align:start position:0%
take their vacations
 
00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:30.880 align:start position:0%
we also heard concern that the first
 
00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:32.720 align:start position:0%
wednesday of march
 
00:29:34.870 --> 00:29:34.880 align:start position:0%
was too early for the start of the
 
00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
filing period
 
00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
this amendment moves the filing period
 
00:29:41.430 --> 00:29:41.440 align:start position:0%
to the fourth wednesday of april
 
00:29:43.909 --> 00:29:43.919 align:start position:0%
this does shorten the filing time the
 
00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
period of time between the filing period
 
00:29:46.789 --> 00:29:46.799 align:start position:0%
and the primary
 
00:29:48.789 --> 00:29:48.799 align:start position:0%
to two months but of course nothing
 
00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
prevents a candidate
 
00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
from starting the campaign before the
 
00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
filing period begins
 
00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
secretary of state already has the
 
00:29:58.470 --> 00:29:58.480 align:start position:0%
authority in redistricting
 
00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:01.520 align:start position:0%
years to move the filing period back in
 
00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
the event that redistricting is not
 
00:30:05.269 --> 00:30:05.279 align:start position:0%
finalized before the filing period
 
00:30:05.279 --> 00:30:06.389 align:start position:0%
finalized before the filing period
begins

00:30:06.389 --> 00:30:06.399 align:start position:0%
begins
 
00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:09.200 align:start position:0%
this amendment adds language to give the
 
00:30:10.230 --> 00:30:10.240 align:start position:0%
secretary of state
 
00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:12.320 align:start position:0%
similar authority to move the primary
 
00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
date in a redistricting year
 
00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:16.960 align:start position:0%
if he has exercised his authority to
 
00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:18.320 align:start position:0%
move violent day
 
00:30:20.830 --> 00:30:20.840 align:start position:0%
i urge you to support this amendment
 
00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:22.950 align:start position:0%
i urge you to support this amendment
hb-98

00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:22.960 align:start position:0%
hb-98
 
00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:26.480 align:start position:0%
thank you discussions about this primary
 
00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:28.710 align:start position:0%
thank you discussions about this primary
data

00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:28.720 align:start position:0%
data
 
00:30:32.389 --> 00:30:32.399 align:start position:0%
representative lane yes i was wondering
 
00:30:33.909 --> 00:30:33.919 align:start position:0%
why we're not retaining
 
00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:36.240 align:start position:0%
this bill the same way we retain the
 
00:30:37.190 --> 00:30:37.200 align:start position:0%
other bills
 
00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
regarding a change in the date because
 
00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:40.640 align:start position:0%
we thought
 
00:30:43.510 --> 00:30:43.520 align:start position:0%
there would be some more work done into
 
00:30:44.149 --> 00:30:44.159 align:start position:0%
and to
 
00:30:54.230 --> 00:30:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
i guess that's not particularly to the
 
00:30:58.149 --> 00:30:58.159 align:start position:0%
amendment but to the overall bill
 
00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
um i believe and i'm ready to speak to
 
00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:03.200 align:start position:0%
it on the bill itself that this is a
 
00:31:05.269 --> 00:31:05.279 align:start position:0%
very important change i think it is
 
00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:08.320 align:start position:0%
a change that benefits both of the major
 
00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
i think it benefits all parties because
 
00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
it gives an opportunity
 
00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:14.720 align:start position:0%
to coalesce behind a uh behind the
 
00:31:16.149 --> 00:31:16.159 align:start position:0%
chosen candidate
 
00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:18.240 align:start position:0%
uh in a period of more than the current
 
00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:20.320 align:start position:0%
seven or eight weeks that we have
 
00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
and this allows us to get this bill
 
00:31:25.269 --> 00:31:25.279 align:start position:0%
before the senate
 
00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
hopefully passed there and allows for
 
00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
planning time that's needed
 
00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:31.840 align:start position:0%
by the secretary of state to make the
 
00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:33.430 align:start position:0%
by the secretary of state to make the
adjustments

00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:33.440 align:start position:0%
adjustments
 
00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:35.840 align:start position:0%
representative barry yeah i just want to
 
00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
kind of answer representative lane's
 
00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:38.149 align:start position:0%
kind of answer representative lane's
question

00:31:38.149 --> 00:31:38.159 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:40.960 align:start position:0%
a little more directly she asked why
 
00:31:41.669 --> 00:31:41.679 align:start position:0%
we're doing
 
00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:44.240 align:start position:0%
this one and not the other two so we
 
00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
talked about
 
00:31:47.909 --> 00:31:47.919 align:start position:0%
working on the movement primary date
 
00:31:49.509 --> 00:31:49.519 align:start position:0%
this is the this is the vehicle
 
00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
that we're working on so the amendment
 
00:31:52.549 --> 00:31:52.559 align:start position:0%
that we have before us
 
00:31:54.789 --> 00:31:54.799 align:start position:0%
is is is the work product of that it's
 
00:31:56.549 --> 00:31:56.559 align:start position:0%
already it's already undergone
 
00:31:58.389 --> 00:31:58.399 align:start position:0%
i think two or three compromises at this
 
00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:00.240 align:start position:0%
point as representative gruen said
 
00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:02.480 align:start position:0%
particularly around school dates and
 
00:32:03.909 --> 00:32:03.919 align:start position:0%
trying to make sure that the filing
 
00:32:03.919 --> 00:32:04.789 align:start position:0%
trying to make sure that the filing
window

00:32:04.789 --> 00:32:04.799 align:start position:0%
window
 
00:32:06.389 --> 00:32:06.399 align:start position:0%
uh kind of matches up with our
 
00:32:08.149 --> 00:32:08.159 align:start position:0%
legislative schedule to as best as we
 
00:32:09.909 --> 00:32:09.919 align:start position:0%
can so i hope that answers your question
 
00:32:11.909 --> 00:32:11.919 align:start position:0%
representative lane
 
00:32:15.669 --> 00:32:15.679 align:start position:0%
so so i guess to put your response
 
00:32:17.509 --> 00:32:17.519 align:start position:0%
another way the retentive retention
 
00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:19.200 align:start position:0%
wasn't so much because you disagreed
 
00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:20.720 align:start position:0%
with the concept
 
00:32:23.029 --> 00:32:23.039 align:start position:0%
people who were proposing this believed
 
00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:24.720 align:start position:0%
that this was the better vehicle to do
 
00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:25.269 align:start position:0%
that this was the better vehicle to do
it

00:32:25.269 --> 00:32:25.279 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:32:28.870 --> 00:32:28.880 align:start position:0%
right could i have a follow-up
 
00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
madam chair go ahead
 
00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:36.320 align:start position:0%
um i'm curious because when we had bills
 
00:32:37.669 --> 00:32:37.679 align:start position:0%
like this before us
 
00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:40.720 align:start position:0%
uh in previous session uh many people
 
00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
felt that june was
 
00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
too early that we were still doing the
 
00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
house's business
 
00:32:48.149 --> 00:32:48.159 align:start position:0%
and to try and run a campaign and finish
 
00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
up the house's business
 
00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
was too much of a burden particularly
 
00:32:55.269 --> 00:32:55.279 align:start position:0%
for essentially a volunteer position
 
00:32:58.149 --> 00:32:58.159 align:start position:0%
so i'm i'm curious as to what the reason
 
00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
is for that change in opinion
 
00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:03.269 align:start position:0%
is for that change in opinion
now

00:33:03.269 --> 00:33:03.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:05.360 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that everybody had that
 
00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
opinion i think
 
00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:17.029 --> 00:33:17.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:18.640 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative for the
 
00:33:20.389 --> 00:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
questions on the bill i'm also one of
 
00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:22.720 align:start position:0%
the sponsors on the legislation
 
00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
um as we've said we have two other
 
00:33:26.950 --> 00:33:26.960 align:start position:0%
pieces of legislation that do move the
 
00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
primary date
 
00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
um i do not think it is asking too much
 
00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
of the individuals running for the
 
00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:34.549 align:start position:0%
of the individuals running for the
legislature

00:33:34.549 --> 00:33:34.559 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
00:33:37.669 --> 00:33:37.679 align:start position:0%
to campaign for a june primary and then
 
00:33:39.509 --> 00:33:39.519 align:start position:0%
a november general election
 
00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
uh like many grand staters then they
 
00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
would be able to go
 
00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
um and take a little vacation in july
 
00:33:46.789 --> 00:33:46.799 align:start position:0%
and august
 
00:33:48.389 --> 00:33:48.399 align:start position:0%
when most granite staters aren't really
 
00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:50.320 align:start position:0%
paying attention to politics
 
00:33:53.029 --> 00:33:53.039 align:start position:0%
anyways and then we rush right back into
 
00:33:54.549 --> 00:33:54.559 align:start position:0%
uh after labor day weekend
 
00:33:57.190 --> 00:33:57.200 align:start position:0%
into september and october um in those
 
00:33:58.789 --> 00:33:58.799 align:start position:0%
that first week of november for the
 
00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
general election
 
00:34:02.470 --> 00:34:02.480 align:start position:0%
um we're really not overwhelmingly
 
00:34:04.230 --> 00:34:04.240 align:start position:0%
changing the the calendar
 
00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
of when a campaign is going to be really
 
00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
the crunch time for the campaign
 
00:34:10.470 --> 00:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
is always the last two weeks before the
 
00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
election that doesn't change
 
00:34:14.069 --> 00:34:14.079 align:start position:0%
under this bill and i can't change under
 
00:34:15.669 --> 00:34:15.679 align:start position:0%
any legislation because
 
00:34:17.349 --> 00:34:17.359 align:start position:0%
that's just a practical component of
 
00:34:18.869 --> 00:34:18.879 align:start position:0%
political campaigning
 
00:34:21.990 --> 00:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
um the 45-day window really before the
 
00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:22.869 align:start position:0%
um the 45-day window really before the
election

00:34:22.869 --> 00:34:22.879 align:start position:0%
election
 
00:34:24.710 --> 00:34:24.720 align:start position:0%
um is usually the time when people are
 
00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
campaigning i don't see any reason
 
00:34:29.589 --> 00:34:29.599 align:start position:0%
why this bill would require anybody to
 
00:34:31.669 --> 00:34:31.679 align:start position:0%
campaign more than 45 days out from the
 
00:34:31.679 --> 00:34:32.470 align:start position:0%
campaign more than 45 days out from the
primary

00:34:32.470 --> 00:34:32.480 align:start position:0%
primary
 
00:34:34.389 --> 00:34:34.399 align:start position:0%
and then 45 days out from the general
 
00:34:36.069 --> 00:34:36.079 align:start position:0%
election when they're the nominee
 
00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
especially when they're running for
 
00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:39.280 align:start position:0%
state legislative seats uh
 
00:34:41.909 --> 00:34:41.919 align:start position:0%
that we all occupy but this bill will go
 
00:34:43.349 --> 00:34:43.359 align:start position:0%
to great lengths to ensure that
 
00:34:44.869 --> 00:34:44.879 align:start position:0%
candidates that are running for those
 
00:34:46.470 --> 00:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
executive council seats
 
00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
uh some of those more competitive state
 
00:34:50.149 --> 00:34:50.159 align:start position:0%
senate seats the congressional seats the
 
00:34:51.270 --> 00:34:51.280 align:start position:0%
senate seats
 
00:34:53.669 --> 00:34:53.679 align:start position:0%
and the governor's seat i will have more
 
00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
time to organize and build their
 
00:34:56.629 --> 00:34:56.639 align:start position:0%
campaign than something that both
 
00:34:56.639 --> 00:34:57.430 align:start position:0%
campaign than something that both
parties

00:34:57.430 --> 00:34:57.440 align:start position:0%
parties
 
00:34:58.870 --> 00:34:58.880 align:start position:0%
are going to benefit from in the long
 
00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:00.630 align:start position:0%
are going to benefit from in the long
run

00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:00.640 align:start position:0%
run
 
00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:03.200 align:start position:0%
representative cody thank you madam
 
00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:04.240 align:start position:0%
chair i guess
 
00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
i have the same concerns that
 
00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
representative lane has
 
00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
especially considering that
 
00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
um i just lost my audio can everybody
 
00:35:14.550 --> 00:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
hear me
 
00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
yes okay now it's back um
 
00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:20.720 align:start position:0%
especially considering the fact that
 
00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
historically we've
 
00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:24.160 align:start position:0%
we've wanted to take a closer look at
 
00:35:25.750 --> 00:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
some of these and we did that in the
 
00:35:27.349 --> 00:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
past and so
 
00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
i think what ought to happen here is
 
00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:30.800 align:start position:0%
this bill ought to be retained
 
00:35:33.430 --> 00:35:33.440 align:start position:0%
as the other ones were and we ought to
 
00:35:35.910 --> 00:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
work on those and come out with a
 
00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:38.960 align:start position:0%
unified position uh that
 
00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
includes both the majority party and the
 
00:35:43.589 --> 00:35:43.599 align:start position:0%
minority party as to where we go forward
 
00:35:45.109 --> 00:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
if we can't do that
 
00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:47.680 align:start position:0%
that's another question but i will be
 
00:35:49.109 --> 00:35:49.119 align:start position:0%
opposing the
 
00:35:52.310 --> 00:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
the motion in chief when it arises thank
 
00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:54.390 align:start position:0%
the motion in chief when it arises thank
you

00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:35:57.430 --> 00:35:57.440 align:start position:0%
representative uh it's just a
 
00:35:59.349 --> 00:35:59.359 align:start position:0%
just to kind of explain one more thing
 
00:36:00.710 --> 00:36:00.720 align:start position:0%
to her
 
00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:07.829 --> 00:36:07.839 align:start position:0%
i've had a lot of work on this bill
 
00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
talking with state reps
 
00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
and what i have to constantly remind
 
00:36:13.829 --> 00:36:13.839 align:start position:0%
them is we are not the only ones on the
 
00:36:13.839 --> 00:36:14.790 align:start position:0%
them is we are not the only ones on the
ballot

00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:14.800 align:start position:0%
ballot
 
00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:18.240 align:start position:0%
and you can't look at our primary
 
00:36:19.589 --> 00:36:19.599 align:start position:0%
solely through the limbs of a state
 
00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
representative i can't say you disregard
 
00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:22.630 align:start position:0%
representative i can't say you disregard
it

00:36:22.630 --> 00:36:22.640 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:36:24.790 --> 00:36:24.800 align:start position:0%
but there's other people on the ballot
 
00:36:26.390 --> 00:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
there's governor u.s senate
 
00:36:28.950 --> 00:36:28.960 align:start position:0%
congress county commissioners there's a
 
00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:29.430 align:start position:0%
congress county commissioners there's a
whole

00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:29.440 align:start position:0%
whole
 
00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
executive council of state senate
 
00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:32.640 align:start position:0%
there's a whole different campaigns on
 
00:36:33.829 --> 00:36:33.839 align:start position:0%
the ballot and we are a volunteer
 
00:36:35.349 --> 00:36:35.359 align:start position:0%
legislator we all make the same amount
 
00:36:37.589 --> 00:36:37.599 align:start position:0%
of money
 
00:36:43.510 --> 00:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:45.280 align:start position:0%
the reality is as a state rep the
 
00:36:46.870 --> 00:36:46.880 align:start position:0%
overwhelming vast majority of state reps
 
00:36:48.310 --> 00:36:48.320 align:start position:0%
do not undergo primaries that are
 
00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:49.270 align:start position:0%
do not undergo primaries that are
incumbents

00:36:49.270 --> 00:36:49.280 align:start position:0%
incumbents
 
00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
um and it's it's actually in my opinion
 
00:36:53.990 --> 00:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
it burdened us the least and the idea
 
00:36:56.390 --> 00:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
that somehow as legislators we can't
 
00:36:58.069 --> 00:36:58.079 align:start position:0%
simultaneously read legislation and
 
00:36:59.829 --> 00:36:59.839 align:start position:0%
campaign or walking two guns at the same
 
00:37:00.790 --> 00:37:00.800 align:start position:0%
time is
 
00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:04.240 align:start position:0%
is a little little out there most other
 
00:37:05.109 --> 00:37:05.119 align:start position:0%
states do this
 
00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:06.640 align:start position:0%
and i recognize that most other states
 
00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
don't have a volunteer legislator
 
00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:10.160 align:start position:0%
and i'm sensitive to that but i think
 
00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
the reality is this
 
00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:14.800 align:start position:0%
does more good than bad and it is
 
00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:16.240 align:start position:0%
already the result of multiple
 
00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
compromises we've already moved it back
 
00:37:20.829 --> 00:37:20.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:25.430 --> 00:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
um multiple compromises from europe
 
00:37:28.150 --> 00:37:28.160 align:start position:0%
yes just to make that clear all right
 
00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:29.670 align:start position:0%
yes just to make that clear all right
representative

00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:29.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:32.240 align:start position:0%
yeah i would like to respond as well to
 
00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:33.030 align:start position:0%
yeah i would like to respond as well to
that

00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:36.720 align:start position:0%
a very small uh
 
00:37:40.390 --> 00:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
minority of state rep races have
 
00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:41.670 align:start position:0%
minority of state rep races have
primaries

00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:41.680 align:start position:0%
primaries
 
00:37:44.550 --> 00:37:44.560 align:start position:0%
and even on state senate races which are
 
00:37:46.069 --> 00:37:46.079 align:start position:0%
a little more competitive
 
00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:48.880 align:start position:0%
very few of them have primaries on the
 
00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
other hand
 
00:37:54.630 --> 00:37:54.640 align:start position:0%
every state senate race has an opponent
 
00:37:56.310 --> 00:37:56.320 align:start position:0%
in the general election
 
00:37:58.870 --> 00:37:58.880 align:start position:0%
and nearly all state rep races have an
 
00:38:00.870 --> 00:38:00.880 align:start position:0%
opponent in the general election so
 
00:38:03.349 --> 00:38:03.359 align:start position:0%
i think the advantage of this is that it
 
00:38:03.359 --> 00:38:04.950 align:start position:0%
i think the advantage of this is that it
gives

00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
gives
 
00:38:08.230 --> 00:38:08.240 align:start position:0%
the parties time to coalesce behind the
 
00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
chosen candidates and
 
00:38:13.349 --> 00:38:13.359 align:start position:0%
as far as campaigning the
 
00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:16.720 align:start position:0%
the representatives and senators that
 
00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
don't have a primary most likely are
 
00:38:21.349 --> 00:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
going to start campaigning before the
 
00:38:24.150 --> 00:38:24.160 align:start position:0%
june primary or if they are they're
 
00:38:25.589 --> 00:38:25.599 align:start position:0%
going to start whether or not it's in
 
00:38:26.870 --> 00:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
june or september
 
00:38:29.990 --> 00:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
so i i think that for the house races
 
00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:30.390 align:start position:0%
so i i think that for the house races
it's

00:38:30.390 --> 00:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:38:33.430 --> 00:38:33.440 align:start position:0%
not nearly as big of an issue because
 
00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
such a small proportion of these races
 
00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
for anybody else on the motion on the
 
00:38:45.270 --> 00:38:45.280 align:start position:0%
floor is a motion to
 
00:38:48.069 --> 00:38:48.079 align:start position:0%
amend representative lane i guess i
 
00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
would just like to comment that
 
00:38:52.310 --> 00:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
because our pay is a hundred dollars a
 
00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:53.270 align:start position:0%
because our pay is a hundred dollars a
year

00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:38:56.470 --> 00:38:56.480 align:start position:0%
many of us also work either full-time or
 
00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:57.670 align:start position:0%
many of us also work either full-time or
part-time

00:38:57.670 --> 00:38:57.680 align:start position:0%
part-time
 
00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
and also the legislative schedule at
 
00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
least this year has been
 
00:39:04.069 --> 00:39:04.079 align:start position:0%
grueling and i suspect it will be next
 
00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
year as well
 
00:39:08.470 --> 00:39:08.480 align:start position:0%
and i just would humbly point out
 
00:39:11.910 --> 00:39:11.920 align:start position:0%
that not all of us have the
 
00:39:15.510 --> 00:39:15.520 align:start position:0%
time to campaign do legislative work
 
00:39:17.510 --> 00:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
and try and continue in our full-time
 
00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:19.280 align:start position:0%
jobs as well
 
00:39:21.349 --> 00:39:21.359 align:start position:0%
and i think that's one of the reasons
 
00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:22.880 align:start position:0%
why in the past
 
00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
people had not liked this position
 
00:39:29.349 --> 00:39:29.359 align:start position:0%
including um many you know
 
00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
from both parties actually so i hear
 
00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:32.960 align:start position:0%
what you're saying
 
00:39:34.950 --> 00:39:34.960 align:start position:0%
i just raised the concern and i realized
 
00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
that's not a question but i just i am
 
00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:42.160 align:start position:0%
concerned about it
 
00:39:44.310 --> 00:39:44.320 align:start position:0%
thank you any other comments on the
 
00:39:46.470 --> 00:39:46.480 align:start position:0%
motion on the floor which is
 
00:39:49.870 --> 00:39:49.880 align:start position:0%

representative i move on to pass

madam chair on uh hb 98
 
00:41:18.839 --> 00:41:30.870 align:start position:0%
madam chair on uh hb 98
is

00:41:30.870 --> 00:41:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:32.480 align:start position:0%
we've already talked about i think we've
 
00:41:33.990 --> 00:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
had significant discussion
 
00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:35.680 align:start position:0%
on the body of the bill and the purpose
 
00:41:37.270 --> 00:41:37.280 align:start position:0%
of the bill so i
 
00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:45.680 align:start position:0%
thank you i
 
00:41:48.790 --> 00:41:48.800 align:start position:0%
i'm going to support the bill
 
00:41:51.190 --> 00:41:51.200 align:start position:0%
i think the bill as we know has other
 
00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:51.910 align:start position:0%
i think the bill as we know has other
chambers

00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
chambers
 
00:41:55.349 --> 00:41:55.359 align:start position:0%
to deal with i do think that it raises
 
00:41:57.349 --> 00:41:57.359 align:start position:0%
more concerns for the state rep race
 
00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
perhaps than it does for other races so
 
00:42:05.190 --> 00:42:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:09.190 --> 00:42:09.200 align:start position:0%
and we'll see end up
 
00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
so nobody else has any
 
00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:14.640 align:start position:0%
comments i'm going to ask her to call
 
00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:16.560 align:start position:0%

of an army report the next bill that
 
00:43:39.150 --> 00:43:39.160 align:start position:0%
we're considering this morning is hb
 
00:43:42.150 --> 00:43:42.160 align:start position:0%
327 requiring that voter show

city clerks
 
00:43:50.069 --> 00:43:50.079 align:start position:0%
this was continued from march
 
00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
8. um this had to do with the actual
 
00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:54.309 align:start position:0%
8. um this had to do with the actual
envelope

00:43:54.309 --> 00:43:54.319 align:start position:0%
envelope
 
00:43:56.390 --> 00:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
and uh what was going to happen when it
 
00:43:58.150 --> 00:43:58.160 align:start position:0%
was delivered
 
00:44:01.829 --> 00:44:01.839 align:start position:0%
is there a motion yes

the connection between the little tiny
 
00:47:06.790 --> 00:47:06.800 align:start position:0%
thought in my head and the noise that
 
00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:08.640 align:start position:0%

00:47:16.710 --> 00:47:16.720 align:start position:0%

talking about this morning is 531
 
00:47:27.109 --> 00:47:27.119 align:start position:0%
this is relative to determining the
 
00:47:29.109 --> 00:47:29.119 align:start position:0%
qualification of voters and establishing
 
00:47:30.710 --> 00:47:30.720 align:start position:0%
provisional voter registration and
 
00:47:32.470 --> 00:47:32.480 align:start position:0%
provisional ballots
 
00:47:36.710 --> 00:47:36.720 align:start position:0%
uh this had a public hearing on march 8.
 
00:47:40.309 --> 00:47:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:44.150 --> 00:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
representative i'll make a motion
 
00:47:49.030 --> 00:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
i make a motion retain house bill 531
 
00:47:57.750 --> 00:47:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:00.710 --> 00:48:00.720 align:start position:0%
sure um i believe there's some some
 
00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
pieces of
 
00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:04.240 align:start position:0%
the bill that are worthwhile and make a
 
00:48:06.950 --> 00:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
lot of sense there are some
 
00:48:08.710 --> 00:48:08.720 align:start position:0%
details that need to be worked out hence
 
00:48:10.950 --> 00:48:10.960 align:start position:0%
the reason to retain it so we can work
 
00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:12.069 align:start position:0%
the reason to retain it so we can work
out

00:48:12.069 --> 00:48:12.079 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:48:14.790 --> 00:48:14.800 align:start position:0%
some of the little things that need to
 
00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:15.510 align:start position:0%
some of the little things that need to
be

00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:48:18.630 --> 00:48:18.640 align:start position:0%
massaged if you will and hopefully bring
 
00:48:21.190 --> 00:48:21.200 align:start position:0%
it out as an otp
 
00:48:25.109 --> 00:48:25.119 align:start position:0%
later in the legislative season
 
00:48:26.790 --> 00:48:26.800 align:start position:0%
thank you is there anybody else who
 
00:48:28.470 --> 00:48:28.480 align:start position:0%
wishes to speak to the motion on the
 
00:48:31.030 --> 00:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
floor which is to retain
 
00:48:33.990 --> 00:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
i guess i have a question about uh what
 
00:48:35.510 --> 00:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
what are the details that need to be
 
00:48:37.030 --> 00:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
worked out and what are the parts of the
 
00:48:38.390 --> 00:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
bill that
 
00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
people think has merit or specifically
 
00:48:42.309 --> 00:48:42.319 align:start position:0%
the previous speaker
 
00:48:45.349 --> 00:48:45.359 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah so i i think
 
00:48:48.710 --> 00:48:48.720 align:start position:0%
there's some common sense um parts of
 
00:48:50.470 --> 00:48:50.480 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:48:54.390 --> 00:48:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:57.589 --> 00:48:57.599 align:start position:0%
the provisional voter registration in
 
00:48:57.599 --> 00:48:59.030 align:start position:0%
the provisional voter registration in
battles

00:48:59.030 --> 00:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
battles
 
00:49:02.710 --> 00:49:02.720 align:start position:0%
i mean you know we do voter id
 
00:49:06.790 --> 00:49:06.800 align:start position:0%
uh the reality is that people carry ids
 
00:49:09.109 --> 00:49:09.119 align:start position:0%
i know in the past we've heard that
 
00:49:10.790 --> 00:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
there's problems
 
00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
with people that don't have ids but the
 
00:49:14.790 --> 00:49:14.800 align:start position:0%
numbers don't show that
 
00:49:16.390 --> 00:49:16.400 align:start position:0%
so i think it's common sense thing we
 
00:49:17.910 --> 00:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
heard we heard that there's
 
00:49:21.430 --> 00:49:21.440 align:start position:0%
um some um
 
00:49:24.630 --> 00:49:24.640 align:start position:0%
fair amount of numbers every year people
 
00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:25.190 align:start position:0%
fair amount of numbers every year people
that

00:49:25.190 --> 00:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:49:28.870 --> 00:49:28.880 align:start position:0%
don't bother to ever produce
 
00:49:32.150 --> 00:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
id or you know uh concrete proof that
 
00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:33.990 align:start position:0%
id or you know uh concrete proof that
they're

00:49:33.990 --> 00:49:34.000 align:start position:0%
they're
 
00:49:35.109 --> 00:49:35.119 align:start position:0%
that they're resident where they're
 
00:49:37.190 --> 00:49:37.200 align:start position:0%
voting so i just think it's you know
 
00:49:38.549 --> 00:49:38.559 align:start position:0%
other states do this there are other
 
00:49:40.069 --> 00:49:40.079 align:start position:0%
states that do this with
 
00:49:43.510 --> 00:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:45.430 --> 00:49:45.440 align:start position:0%
you're uh about the provisional value
 
00:49:47.349 --> 00:49:47.359 align:start position:0%
right right yeah
 
00:49:50.390 --> 00:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
yes so anyway
 
00:49:54.309 --> 00:49:54.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:01.030 --> 00:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:03.589 --> 00:50:03.599 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none i'm going to ask

before us would revert us back to
 
00:55:01.190 --> 00:55:01.200 align:start position:0%
how state law was before house bill 1264
 
00:55:03.990 --> 00:55:04.000 align:start position:0%
was passed and implemented in 2018. uh
 
00:55:04.630 --> 00:55:04.640 align:start position:0%
that bill
 
00:55:06.549 --> 00:55:06.559 align:start position:0%
underwent thorough review when it was
 
00:55:08.150 --> 00:55:08.160 align:start position:0%
debated and passed
 
00:55:10.710 --> 00:55:10.720 align:start position:0%
in 2018 and we have run several
 
00:55:12.230 --> 00:55:12.240 align:start position:0%
elections in the state of new hampshire
 
00:55:14.150 --> 00:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
under those provisions since then
 
00:55:16.549 --> 00:55:16.559 align:start position:0%
uh without issue and increased integrity
 
00:55:17.829 --> 00:55:17.839 align:start position:0%
in our elections
 
00:55:19.510 --> 00:55:19.520 align:start position:0%
so i would recommend that we all find
 
00:55:21.670 --> 00:55:21.680 align:start position:0%
this built in expedient to legislate
 
00:55:23.270 --> 00:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
in order to ensure the most trust and
 
00:55:25.030 --> 00:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
integrity in our state's elections

yes i would uh there's a lot of credible
issues

00:57:32.950 --> 00:57:32.960 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:57:34.470 --> 00:57:34.480 align:start position:0%
certainly in this build certainly
 
00:57:36.950 --> 00:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
warrants a much fuller discussion than
 
00:57:38.470 --> 00:57:38.480 align:start position:0%
we've had the time to
 
00:57:40.230 --> 00:57:40.240 align:start position:0%
so thus i would encourage my colleagues
 
00:57:41.589 --> 00:57:41.599 align:start position:0%
on the committee to vote
 
00:57:45.829 --> 00:57:45.839 align:start position:0%
to retain any further discussion
 
00:57:47.670 --> 00:57:47.680 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am could i ask the previous
 
00:57:49.510 --> 00:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
speaker what what the nature of the
 
00:57:50.789 --> 00:57:50.799 align:start position:0%
discussion is and
 
00:57:54.309 --> 00:57:54.319 align:start position:0%
what needs to be further determined
 
00:57:58.950 --> 00:57:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:01.670 --> 00:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
go ahead i'm sorry thank you uh thank
 
00:58:03.030 --> 00:58:03.040 align:start position:0%
you for the question
 
00:58:06.150 --> 00:58:06.160 align:start position:0%
i with regards to domicile it's an issue
 
00:58:08.789 --> 00:58:08.799 align:start position:0%
and there are various sub issues that go
 
00:58:10.470 --> 00:58:10.480 align:start position:0%
with it in new hampshire
 
00:58:13.270 --> 00:58:13.280 align:start position:0%
and so i think a fuller discussion based
 
00:58:13.280 --> 00:58:14.069 align:start position:0%
and so i think a fuller discussion based
on

00:58:14.069 --> 00:58:14.079 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:58:18.069 --> 00:58:18.079 align:start position:0%
this content would be warranted
 
00:58:23.030 --> 00:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
to fully flesh out the issue of domicile
 
00:58:26.470 --> 00:58:26.480 align:start position:0%
representative your head i'm curious
 
00:58:28.150 --> 00:58:28.160 align:start position:0%
what problem again i'm curious what
 
00:58:29.349 --> 00:58:29.359 align:start position:0%
problem the bill is trying to solve or
 
00:58:30.950 --> 00:58:30.960 align:start position:0%
what is the particular problem that the
 
00:58:34.309 --> 00:58:34.319 align:start position:0%
word domicile is causing
 
00:58:36.230 --> 00:58:36.240 align:start position:0%
if i can answer and sponsor the bill i
 
00:58:39.030 --> 00:58:39.040 align:start position:0%
don't think for this particular bill
 
00:58:42.950 --> 00:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:46.150 --> 00:58:46.160 align:start position:0%
to it issues not only the domicile issue
 
00:58:49.190 --> 00:58:49.200 align:start position:0%
but the temporary aspect of whatever may
 
00:58:50.630 --> 00:58:50.640 align:start position:0%
be going on in the state
 
00:58:54.470 --> 00:58:54.480 align:start position:0%
so i think that was what was being
 
00:58:56.710 --> 00:58:56.720 align:start position:0%
trying to be addressed in regards to
 
00:58:59.190 --> 00:58:59.200 align:start position:0%
this legislation
 
00:59:02.630 --> 00:59:02.640 align:start position:0%
and further defining as to
 
00:59:05.030 --> 00:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
what is needed to be connected to the
 
00:59:06.789 --> 00:59:06.799 align:start position:0%
state for purposes
 
00:59:11.589 --> 00:59:11.599 align:start position:0%
of election laws in 654
 
00:59:13.990 --> 00:59:14.000 align:start position:0%
additionally i think these provisions
 
00:59:15.829 --> 00:59:15.839 align:start position:0%
are part of
 
00:59:18.470 --> 00:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
ongoing litigation that would go back
 
00:59:20.710 --> 00:59:20.720 align:start position:0%
two sessions to the bills that frankly i
 
00:59:20.720 --> 00:59:21.109 align:start position:0%
two sessions to the bills that frankly i
think

00:59:21.109 --> 00:59:21.119 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:59:23.349 --> 00:59:23.359 align:start position:0%
a previous bill was directly related to
 
00:59:24.950 --> 00:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
that would be what was referred to back
 
00:59:25.430 --> 00:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
then as
 
00:59:28.630 --> 00:59:28.640 align:start position:0%
sb3 um and so
 
00:59:30.309 --> 00:59:30.319 align:start position:0%
i think some of the changes to the
 
00:59:32.870 --> 00:59:32.880 align:start position:0%
statutes that are directly affected by
 
00:59:35.990 --> 00:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
sb3 might be premature pending a
 
00:59:39.190 --> 00:59:39.200 align:start position:0%
decision but by retaining them it gives
 
00:59:41.190 --> 00:59:41.200 align:start position:0%
us as a body and ability to work with
 
00:59:42.230 --> 00:59:42.240 align:start position:0%
these provisions
 
00:59:43.990 --> 00:59:44.000 align:start position:0%
if we receive the decision on that
 
00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:45.349 align:start position:0%
if we receive the decision on that
litigation

00:59:45.349 --> 00:59:45.359 align:start position:0%
litigation
 
00:59:48.870 --> 00:59:48.880 align:start position:0%
so i think that was part of the reason
 
00:59:51.750 --> 00:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
this bill is was put in and that was
 
00:59:52.549 --> 00:59:52.559 align:start position:0%
part of the
 
00:59:58.829 --> 00:59:58.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:01.589 --> 01:00:01.599 align:start position:0%
retain there any further discussion
 
01:00:05.190 --> 01:00:05.200 align:start position:0%
on hb554 the motion on the floor
 
01:00:09.829 --> 01:00:09.839 align:start position:0%
is to retain i would
 
01:00:11.670 --> 01:00:11.680 align:start position:0%
i would just like to point out that this
 
01:00:14.789 --> 01:00:14.799 align:start position:0%
does go back to sp3 and i am coming to
 
01:00:16.630 --> 01:00:16.640 align:start position:0%
the conclusion particularly after the
 
01:00:18.390 --> 01:00:18.400 align:start position:0%
end of this meeting that the senate is
 
01:00:19.589 --> 01:00:19.599 align:start position:0%
the real cause for
 
01:00:24.630 --> 01:00:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:38.230 --> 01:00:38.240 align:start position:0%

01:01:54.470 --> 01:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
morning is
 
01:01:57.670 --> 01:01:57.680 align:start position:0%
hb 429 this is relative
 
01:01:59.510 --> 01:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
relative to college or university
 
01:02:01.910 --> 01:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
student voting it had a public hearing
 
01:02:04.950 --> 01:02:04.960 align:start position:0%
on march 8 is there a motion yes ma'am
 
01:02:06.630 --> 01:02:06.640 align:start position:0%
chairman i hope that hb
 
01:02:10.230 --> 01:02:10.240 align:start position:0%
429 will be inexpedient to legislate
 
01:02:12.470 --> 01:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
is there a second i second that matters
 
01:02:13.270 --> 01:02:13.280 align:start position:0%
second invite
 
01:02:14.870 --> 01:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
representative swinney would you like to
 
01:02:17.029 --> 01:02:17.039 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion representative
 
01:02:19.349 --> 01:02:19.359 align:start position:0%
yes madam chairman this bill deals
 
01:02:21.029 --> 01:02:21.039 align:start position:0%
directly with college student voting
 
01:02:22.069 --> 01:02:22.079 align:start position:0%
which is obviously
 
01:02:25.270 --> 01:02:25.280 align:start position:0%
a massive conversation that we had
 
01:02:28.150 --> 01:02:28.160 align:start position:0%
a couple of days ago i want to address a
 
01:02:30.069 --> 01:02:30.079 align:start position:0%
couple of things to the committee
 
01:02:31.750 --> 01:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
this has been a question in front of us
 
01:02:33.270 --> 01:02:33.280 align:start position:0%
for a very long time
 
01:02:34.789 --> 01:02:34.799 align:start position:0%
and there are some tough questions to
 
01:02:36.789 --> 01:02:36.799 align:start position:0%
ask here how can someone be
 
01:02:39.349 --> 01:02:39.359 align:start position:0%
an out of state student but not an out
 
01:02:40.630 --> 01:02:40.640 align:start position:0%
of state builder
 
01:02:42.390 --> 01:02:42.400 align:start position:0%
if college students do have the right to
 
01:02:44.069 --> 01:02:44.079 align:start position:0%
vote in our universities
 
01:02:46.230 --> 01:02:46.240 align:start position:0%
where they go in their dorms which the
 
01:02:47.589 --> 01:02:47.599 align:start position:0%
court systems have
 
01:02:50.470 --> 01:02:50.480 align:start position:0%
said in some way what about the college
 
01:02:52.150 --> 01:02:52.160 align:start position:0%
students from new hampshire that go
 
01:02:54.069 --> 01:02:54.079 align:start position:0%
to school out of state do they get to
 
01:02:55.430 --> 01:02:55.440 align:start position:0%
file absentee ballots
 
01:02:57.750 --> 01:02:57.760 align:start position:0%
in their hometown what about college
 
01:02:59.270 --> 01:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
students in new hampshire
 
01:03:00.950 --> 01:03:00.960 align:start position:0%
who go from one town and then move to
 
01:03:02.710 --> 01:03:02.720 align:start position:0%
durham where should they vote
 
01:03:04.630 --> 01:03:04.640 align:start position:0%
these are some tough questions that we
 
01:03:06.150 --> 01:03:06.160 align:start position:0%
have to answer
 
01:03:09.349 --> 01:03:09.359 align:start position:0%
hb 429 does not do a good job of
 
01:03:10.630 --> 01:03:10.640 align:start position:0%
answering that
 
01:03:12.710 --> 01:03:12.720 align:start position:0%
and that's why i'm moving it to as
 
01:03:13.990 --> 01:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
inexperienced to legislate
 
01:03:17.349 --> 01:03:17.359 align:start position:0%
it doesn't answer our questions is there
 
01:03:22.069 --> 01:03:22.079 align:start position:0%
any further discussion representative
 
01:03:25.430 --> 01:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
i i think i agree i i think that um
 
01:03:27.349 --> 01:03:27.359 align:start position:0%
the status of being an in-state student
 
01:03:29.829 --> 01:03:29.839 align:start position:0%
is one that's decided by
 
01:03:32.470 --> 01:03:32.480 align:start position:0%
it applies only to people who are
 
01:03:33.670 --> 01:03:33.680 align:start position:0%
claimed as dependents
 
01:03:36.630 --> 01:03:36.640 align:start position:0%
by their parent and and it applies a
 
01:03:38.230 --> 01:03:38.240 align:start position:0%
12-month durational residency
 
01:03:39.990 --> 01:03:40.000 align:start position:0%
requirement to those parents so it asks
 
01:03:41.270 --> 01:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
are the parents who are claiming this
 
01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:42.390 align:start position:0%
are the parents who are claiming this
dependent

01:03:42.390 --> 01:03:42.400 align:start position:0%
dependent
 
01:03:43.750 --> 01:03:43.760 align:start position:0%
people who have been working and paying
 
01:03:46.069 --> 01:03:46.079 align:start position:0%
taxes in new hampshire over the previous
 
01:03:46.079 --> 01:03:46.950 align:start position:0%
taxes in new hampshire over the previous
year

01:03:46.950 --> 01:03:46.960 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:03:50.230 --> 01:03:50.240 align:start position:0%
um the status of voting doesn't depend
 
01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:50.630 align:start position:0%
um the status of voting doesn't depend
on

01:03:50.630 --> 01:03:50.640 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:03:52.150 --> 01:03:52.160 align:start position:0%
you know doesn't depend in any way and
 
01:03:53.190 --> 01:03:53.200 align:start position:0%
whether you've been claimed as a
 
01:03:54.789 --> 01:03:54.799 align:start position:0%
dependent by your parents they're two
 
01:03:55.910 --> 01:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
totally separate
 
01:03:58.950 --> 01:03:58.960 align:start position:0%
totally disconnected statuses and to
 
01:04:00.390 --> 01:04:00.400 align:start position:0%
make one dependent on the other
 
01:04:03.589 --> 01:04:03.599 align:start position:0%
to really introduce a lot of confusion
 
01:04:05.510 --> 01:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
and also i think court breaking the law
 
01:04:06.630 --> 01:04:06.640 align:start position:0%
and breaking the constitution because
 
01:04:08.069 --> 01:04:08.079 align:start position:0%
the constitution prohibits
 
01:04:09.750 --> 01:04:09.760 align:start position:0%
the racial residency requirements of
 
01:04:12.470 --> 01:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
more than um about well
 
01:04:13.990 --> 01:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
certainly of a year that would prohibit
 
01:04:15.910 --> 01:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
that and so do
 
01:04:18.549 --> 01:04:18.559 align:start position:0%
the voting rights act thank you
 
01:04:20.230 --> 01:04:20.240 align:start position:0%
representative moorhead i also thought
 
01:04:21.510 --> 01:04:21.520 align:start position:0%
it was
 
01:04:23.750 --> 01:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
i recognize that the university system
 
01:04:25.750 --> 01:04:25.760 align:start position:0%
is technically independent so this bill
 
01:04:26.630 --> 01:04:26.640 align:start position:0%
did not
 
01:04:29.109 --> 01:04:29.119 align:start position:0%
have a fiscal note um but i thought
 
01:04:30.150 --> 01:04:30.160 align:start position:0%
hearing that it might
 
01:04:33.190 --> 01:04:33.200 align:start position:0%
cost uh potentially 170 million
 
01:04:35.430 --> 01:04:35.440 align:start position:0%
to an institute of higher learning was
 
01:04:37.109 --> 01:04:37.119 align:start position:0%
something that probably should have been
 
01:04:39.190 --> 01:04:39.200 align:start position:0%
considered especially
 
01:04:42.230 --> 01:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
given the current financial times
 
01:04:46.069 --> 01:04:46.079 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion on hb429
 
01:04:48.230 --> 01:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
the motion on the floor is an expedient
 
01:04:50.150 --> 01:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
to legislate
 
01:04:52.069 --> 01:04:52.079 align:start position:0%
seeing none i'm going to ask the clerk
 
01:04:57.589 --> 01:04:57.599 align:start position:0%

01:06:48.870 --> 01:06:48.880 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to your mother
 
01:06:51.910 --> 01:06:51.920 align:start position:0%
yes i would thank you uh i don't think
 
01:06:53.270 --> 01:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
this bill is ready to pass
 
01:06:56.549 --> 01:06:56.559 align:start position:0%
there's two specifics about it one that
 
01:07:00.230 --> 01:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
deletes rsa 654-1
 
01:07:03.510 --> 01:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
section i which essentially defines and
 
01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:04.150 align:start position:0%
section i which essentially defines and
have

01:07:04.150 --> 01:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:07:07.349 --> 01:07:07.359 align:start position:0%
inhabitants domicile for voting purposes
 
01:07:10.549 --> 01:07:10.559 align:start position:0%
and it does this for repeals this which
 
01:07:12.069 --> 01:07:12.079 align:start position:0%
applies to all voters i think that's
 
01:07:12.079 --> 01:07:12.870 align:start position:0%
applies to all voters i think that's
very

01:07:12.870 --> 01:07:12.880 align:start position:0%
very
 
01:07:16.069 --> 01:07:16.079 align:start position:0%
problematic secondly is my understanding
 
01:07:16.079 --> 01:07:16.630 align:start position:0%
problematic secondly is my understanding
that

01:07:16.630 --> 01:07:16.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:07:20.309 --> 01:07:20.319 align:start position:0%
the the subject matter
 
01:07:23.190 --> 01:07:23.200 align:start position:0%
this bill also touches upon matters
 
01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:23.829 align:start position:0%
this bill also touches upon matters
still

01:07:23.829 --> 01:07:23.839 align:start position:0%
still
 
01:07:25.750 --> 01:07:25.760 align:start position:0%
under litigation i believe related to
 
01:07:28.710 --> 01:07:28.720 align:start position:0%
the form of sp3
 
01:07:31.109 --> 01:07:31.119 align:start position:0%
reason i'd like to retain it is i think
 
01:07:31.119 --> 01:07:32.630 align:start position:0%
reason i'd like to retain it is i think
that

01:07:32.630 --> 01:07:32.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:07:35.670 --> 01:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
due to other provisions in rsa 64 that
 
01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:36.069 align:start position:0%
due to other provisions in rsa 64 that
we

01:07:36.069 --> 01:07:36.079 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:07:39.589 --> 01:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
could remove the special status
 
01:07:42.630 --> 01:07:42.640 align:start position:0%

other bill we retain we address these
 
01:10:52.950 --> 01:10:52.960 align:start position:0%
issues because there's serious issues
 
01:10:54.870 --> 01:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
and i think it's pretty unbelievable
 
01:10:57.750 --> 01:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
that we we have an open-ended
 
01:11:00.630 --> 01:11:00.640 align:start position:0%
term for temporary very very natural
 
01:11:01.350 --> 01:11:01.360 align:start position:0%
where most people
 
01:11:03.990 --> 01:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
think temporary is it's not five years
 
01:11:05.189 --> 01:11:05.199 align:start position:0%
or ten years or
 
01:11:07.270 --> 01:11:07.280 align:start position:0%
something or a long term like that so i
 
01:11:08.310 --> 01:11:08.320 align:start position:0%
hope we address this
 
01:11:09.750 --> 01:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
with the other bill because it is an
 
01:11:25.030 --> 01:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:28.470 --> 01:11:28.480 align:start position:0%

will go on consent
 
01:12:41.350 --> 01:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
calendar we have two items of business
 
01:12:43.669 --> 01:12:43.679 align:start position:0%
left for this committee they are sp2
 
01:12:47.750 --> 01:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
and sb 43 as i stated at the beginning
 
01:12:49.270 --> 01:12:49.280 align:start position:0%
of the meeting we have a couple of
 
01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:50.310 align:start position:0%
of the meeting we have a couple of
amendments

01:12:50.310 --> 01:12:50.320 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
01:12:52.070 --> 01:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
and it's my understanding there might be
 
01:12:54.149 --> 01:12:54.159 align:start position:0%
another amendment
 
01:13:00.149 --> 01:13:00.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:03.510 --> 01:13:03.520 align:start position:0%
carefully let's begin our email
 
01:13:07.430 --> 01:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
inbox um
 
01:13:11.430 --> 01:13:11.440 align:start position:0%
we'd love to find it so
 
01:13:14.870 --> 01:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
if we could take
 
01:13:16.070 --> 01:13:16.080 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that
 
01:13:18.310 --> 01:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
representative lane and representative
 
01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:18.870 align:start position:0%

our inbox do we have something
 
01:13:26.229 --> 01:13:26.239 align:start position:0%
no matter here i'm going to say no
 
01:13:27.750 --> 01:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
because there are still some things that
 
01:13:29.750 --> 01:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
need to be ironed out
 
01:13:31.830 --> 01:13:31.840 align:start position:0%

01:13:40.870 --> 01:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
who are familiar with the details of a
 
01:13:42.550 --> 01:13:42.560 align:start position:0%
amendment they would like us to consider
 
01:13:44.149 --> 01:13:44.159 align:start position:0%

representative

02:30:40.710 --> 02:30:40.720 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:30:44.469 --> 02:30:44.479 align:start position:0%
sure so the content
 
02:30:47.429 --> 02:30:47.439 align:start position:0%
the relevant content of this bill has
 
02:30:48.230 --> 02:30:48.240 align:start position:0%
been covered
 
02:30:50.870 --> 02:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
in address with a executive order of the
 
02:30:50.880 --> 02:30:53.349 align:start position:0%
in address with a executive order of the
governors

02:30:53.349 --> 02:30:53.359 align:start position:0%
governors
 
02:30:56.630 --> 02:30:56.640 align:start position:0%
there may be a chance that at some point
 
02:30:56.640 --> 02:30:57.590 align:start position:0%
there may be a chance that at some point
those

02:30:57.590 --> 02:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
those
 
02:30:59.429 --> 02:30:59.439 align:start position:0%
assume that those executive orders
 
02:31:00.630 --> 02:31:00.640 align:start position:0%
become relaxed
 
02:31:03.830 --> 02:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
the event that they get relaxed prior to
 
02:31:05.750 --> 02:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
some of the towns that haven't got to
 
02:31:07.510 --> 02:31:07.520 align:start position:0%
their town elections yet
 
02:31:10.230 --> 02:31:10.240 align:start position:0%
this we could pass this to give them
 
02:31:10.240 --> 02:31:11.990 align:start position:0%
this we could pass this to give them
relief

02:31:11.990 --> 02:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
relief
 
02:31:13.510 --> 02:31:13.520 align:start position:0%
in the event that the executive order
 
02:31:15.670 --> 02:31:15.680 align:start position:0%
stay in places isn't needed anyway
 
02:31:19.429 --> 02:31:19.439 align:start position:0%
and in the final analysis the
 
02:31:23.510 --> 02:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
bill will drop dead after 2021 anyway so
 
02:31:26.070 --> 02:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
i think it's a good back stop to retain
 
02:31:29.349 --> 02:31:29.359 align:start position:0%
it in case it's needed hence the motion
 
02:31:30.950 --> 02:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion on the
 
02:31:33.270 --> 02:31:33.280 align:start position:0%
motion on the board which is to retain
 
02:31:33.280 --> 02:31:37.030 align:start position:0%
motion on the board which is to retain

representative mooney has this matter
 
02:40:57.910 --> 02:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
been caught
 
02:41:01.030 --> 02:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
um reviewed by windham officials i
 
02:41:02.630 --> 02:41:02.640 align:start position:0%
noticed that window
 
02:41:05.750 --> 02:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
officials are on this minute yes this
 
02:41:06.870 --> 02:41:06.880 align:start position:0%
amendment has we've been in
 
02:41:08.710 --> 02:41:08.720 align:start position:0%
communication with the windham
 
02:41:08.720 --> 02:41:10.710 align:start position:0%
communication with the windham
delegation

02:41:10.710 --> 02:41:10.720 align:start position:0%
delegation
 
02:41:13.269 --> 02:41:13.279 align:start position:0%
and they have seen this amendment all
 
02:41:13.279 --> 02:41:13.990 align:start position:0%
and they have seen this amendment all
right

02:41:13.990 --> 02:41:14.000 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:41:17.190 --> 02:41:17.200 align:start position:0%
um i have a question on the amendment
 
02:41:20.309 --> 02:41:20.319 align:start position:0%
um page 2
 
02:41:27.429 --> 02:41:27.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:30.870 --> 02:41:30.880 align:start position:0%
i think that the decision excuse me
 
02:41:34.790 --> 02:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
that you know we're going to have
 
02:41:36.469 --> 02:41:36.479 align:start position:0%
a you know if we have this at a
 
02:41:38.309 --> 02:41:38.319 align:start position:0%
sufficient place big enough to do this
 
02:41:39.910 --> 02:41:39.920 align:start position:0%
and provide security
 
02:41:43.110 --> 02:41:43.120 align:start position:0%
that members of the public and certainly
 
02:41:45.590 --> 02:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
officials are going to want to be there
 
02:41:49.590 --> 02:41:49.600 align:start position:0%
um but i
 
02:41:51.670 --> 02:41:51.680 align:start position:0%
would prefer in legislation that we
 
02:41:53.429 --> 02:41:53.439 align:start position:0%
don't get into the nitty-gritty
 
02:41:56.630 --> 02:41:56.640 align:start position:0%
i would rather leave the nitty-gritty to
 
02:41:58.469 --> 02:41:58.479 align:start position:0%
the officials which would include people
 
02:41:59.830 --> 02:41:59.840 align:start position:0%
like the fire marshal
 
02:42:03.510 --> 02:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
and whatever they decide so
 
02:42:06.230 --> 02:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
when we talk about who might attend it
 
02:42:07.349 --> 02:42:07.359 align:start position:0%
seems to me
 
02:42:10.550 --> 02:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
that if the town of windham
 
02:42:14.070 --> 02:42:14.080 align:start position:0%
wants to have their moderator in
 
02:42:14.080 --> 02:42:17.190 align:start position:0%
wants to have their moderator in
attendance

02:42:17.190 --> 02:42:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:19.349 --> 02:42:19.359 align:start position:0%
the forensic audit team is going to make
 
02:42:20.870 --> 02:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
sure that the moderator doesn't have
 
02:42:22.389 --> 02:42:22.399 align:start position:0%
anything to do with it but
 
02:42:25.510 --> 02:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
it would allow that person to be i don't
 
02:42:27.269 --> 02:42:27.279 align:start position:0%
if windham wants that person to be
 
02:42:29.190 --> 02:42:29.200 align:start position:0%
present i don't see
 
02:42:33.269 --> 02:42:33.279 align:start position:0%
an issue with that um and
 
02:42:35.510 --> 02:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
i know that wyndham officials when they
 
02:42:37.750 --> 02:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
looked at it
 
02:42:40.710 --> 02:42:40.720 align:start position:0%
would want to be able to have some say
 
02:42:42.070 --> 02:42:42.080 align:start position:0%
and there are certainly people who have
 
02:42:42.080 --> 02:42:42.389 align:start position:0%
and there are certainly people who have
been

02:42:42.389 --> 02:42:42.399 align:start position:0%
been
 
02:42:46.710 --> 02:42:46.720 align:start position:0%
active and i and i feel that
 
02:42:48.230 --> 02:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
election officials involved in the
 
02:42:50.389 --> 02:42:50.399 align:start position:0%
recount would include the secretary of
 
02:42:51.190 --> 02:42:51.200 align:start position:0%
state and
 
02:42:53.910 --> 02:42:53.920 align:start position:0%
probably the deputy secretary who you
 
02:42:55.190 --> 02:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
were asking to
 
02:42:57.190 --> 02:42:57.200 align:start position:0%
designate people but they would not be
 
02:42:59.030 --> 02:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
able to attend
 
02:43:01.750 --> 02:43:01.760 align:start position:0%
um and i understand that there were
 
02:43:02.630 --> 02:43:02.640 align:start position:0%
concerns about
 
02:43:04.870 --> 02:43:04.880 align:start position:0%
lhs associates being there i would think
 
02:43:06.230 --> 02:43:06.240 align:start position:0%
that they would want to take advantage
 
02:43:08.070 --> 02:43:08.080 align:start position:0%
of the live stream anyways
 
02:43:09.590 --> 02:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
and i don't know that women would want
 
02:43:11.030 --> 02:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
them there but maybe somebody from the
 
02:43:13.429 --> 02:43:13.439 align:start position:0%
forensic auditing just wants them there
 
02:43:15.110 --> 02:43:15.120 align:start position:0%
and windham would need to use one of
 
02:43:16.870 --> 02:43:16.880 align:start position:0%
their designees
 
02:43:21.030 --> 02:43:21.040 align:start position:0%
um so i raised that issue
 
02:43:24.710 --> 02:43:24.720 align:start position:0%
for i see that representative mooney
 
02:43:26.790 --> 02:43:26.800 align:start position:0%
representative mcdonald representative
 
02:43:28.630 --> 02:43:28.640 align:start position:0%
bergeron and representative lane
 
02:43:31.670 --> 02:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
are on this amendment um and i'm
 
02:43:33.590 --> 02:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
wondering whether
 
02:43:36.309 --> 02:43:36.319 align:start position:0%
and i know that windham does have
 
02:43:36.319 --> 02:43:37.110 align:start position:0%
and i know that windham does have
concerns

02:43:37.110 --> 02:43:37.120 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
02:43:40.469 --> 02:43:40.479 align:start position:0%
that windham be allowed to designate and
 
02:43:40.479 --> 02:43:40.710 align:start position:0%
that windham be allowed to designate and
i

02:43:40.710 --> 02:43:40.720 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:43:43.910 --> 02:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
end so i'm wondering whether the
 
02:43:43.920 --> 02:43:47.190 align:start position:0%
end so i'm wondering whether the
sponsors

02:43:47.190 --> 02:43:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:50.469 --> 02:43:50.479 align:start position:0%
would agree that this amendment i think
 
02:43:52.070 --> 02:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
was a terrific amendment and i want to
 
02:43:53.990 --> 02:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
thank everybody for doing the work
 
02:43:57.110 --> 02:43:57.120 align:start position:0%
but i would like it contingent on lines
 
02:43:59.349 --> 02:43:59.359 align:start position:0%
12 through 17
 
02:44:00.870 --> 02:44:00.880 align:start position:0%
not being a part of the amendment
 
02:44:03.110 --> 02:44:03.120 align:start position:0%
because i think
 
02:44:05.830 --> 02:44:05.840 align:start position:0%
we need to consider some liberties in
 
02:44:06.790 --> 02:44:06.800 align:start position:0%
regards to
 
02:44:08.950 --> 02:44:08.960 align:start position:0%
an attempt and if and if there's only
 
02:44:10.710 --> 02:44:10.720 align:start position:0%
enough space for six people at that
 
02:44:12.070 --> 02:44:12.080 align:start position:0%
point it's not going to be much of an
 
02:44:14.070 --> 02:44:14.080 align:start position:0%
issue anyways
 
02:44:19.670 --> 02:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
so i throw that out there for discussion
 
02:44:22.790 --> 02:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
representative brown uh i would
 
02:44:26.630 --> 02:44:26.640 align:start position:0%
i think the intent madam chair of this
 
02:44:30.070 --> 02:44:30.080 align:start position:0%
is that the people in
 
02:44:32.950 --> 02:44:32.960 align:start position:0%
these especially the first two not be
 
02:44:32.960 --> 02:44:33.750 align:start position:0%
these especially the first two not be
involved

02:44:33.750 --> 02:44:33.760 align:start position:0%
involved
 
02:44:38.070 --> 02:44:38.080 align:start position:0%
in the process i agree with you that
 
02:44:41.429 --> 02:44:41.439 align:start position:0%
c would also involve the i believe would
 
02:44:42.950 --> 02:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
involve the secretary of state and the
 
02:44:45.670 --> 02:44:45.680 align:start position:0%
deputy secretary of state
 
02:44:49.269 --> 02:44:49.279 align:start position:0%
but if if we if the sentence previous to
 
02:44:49.279 --> 02:44:50.070 align:start position:0%
but if if we if the sentence previous to
that

02:44:50.070 --> 02:44:50.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:44:51.830 --> 02:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
read to avoid the appearance of
 
02:44:51.840 --> 02:44:53.349 align:start position:0%
read to avoid the appearance of
propriety

02:44:53.349 --> 02:44:53.359 align:start position:0%
propriety
 
02:44:55.750 --> 02:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
uh none of the following groups shall be
 
02:44:55.760 --> 02:44:56.550 align:start position:0%
uh none of the following groups shall be
involved

02:44:56.550 --> 02:44:56.560 align:start position:0%
involved
 
02:44:59.990 --> 02:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
in the audit process that would that
 
02:45:01.750 --> 02:45:01.760 align:start position:0%
would allow them to attend but not be
 
02:45:06.469 --> 02:45:06.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:09.590 --> 02:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
representative o'brien
 
02:45:12.230 --> 02:45:12.240 align:start position:0%
i believe mr trojan have a question
 
02:45:12.240 --> 02:45:12.950 align:start position:0%
i believe mr trojan have a question
first

02:45:12.950 --> 02:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
first
 
02:45:14.790 --> 02:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry representative thank you
 
02:45:16.550 --> 02:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
madam chair could could i ask um
 
02:45:18.150 --> 02:45:18.160 align:start position:0%
representative pony a question in regard
 
02:45:20.309 --> 02:45:20.319 align:start position:0%
to this
 
02:45:23.590 --> 02:45:23.600 align:start position:0%
so what was the intent of this uh
 
02:45:29.830 --> 02:45:29.840 align:start position:0%
representative on part c
 
02:45:33.030 --> 02:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
part c the election officials yeah
 
02:45:36.469 --> 02:45:36.479 align:start position:0%
that was based on uh feedback received
 
02:45:39.750 --> 02:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
i would be amenable to
 
02:45:42.950 --> 02:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
removing that i would be amenable to
 
02:45:42.960 --> 02:45:44.550 align:start position:0%
removing that i would be amenable to
removing

02:45:44.550 --> 02:45:44.560 align:start position:0%
removing
 
02:45:47.590 --> 02:45:47.600 align:start position:0%
b however
 
02:45:50.790 --> 02:45:50.800 align:start position:0%
i would ask that a
 
02:45:56.070 --> 02:45:56.080 align:start position:0%
be remaining in the bill
 
02:45:57.750 --> 02:45:57.760 align:start position:0%
yeah all right i think i'm okay with
 
02:45:59.510 --> 02:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
that representative summer brian
 
02:46:02.630 --> 02:46:02.640 align:start position:0%
thank you ma'am uh my suggestion
 
02:46:05.590 --> 02:46:05.600 align:start position:0%
for at least a for something for to
 
02:46:06.230 --> 02:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
think about
 
02:46:10.230 --> 02:46:10.240 align:start position:0%
for the other ask for b may be that
 
02:46:13.990 --> 02:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
such persons are available but not
 
02:46:16.550 --> 02:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
in an active role so they're available
 
02:46:19.190 --> 02:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
if consultation is necessary
 
02:46:21.750 --> 02:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
and they're they're there but they are
 
02:46:24.710 --> 02:46:24.720 align:start position:0%
not taking an active role well i guess i
 
02:46:26.469 --> 02:46:26.479 align:start position:0%
come back to you and that's micromanaged
 
02:46:27.670 --> 02:46:27.680 align:start position:0%
too much
 
02:46:30.630 --> 02:46:30.640 align:start position:0%
sorry um that's why i sort of wanted to
 
02:46:31.429 --> 02:46:31.439 align:start position:0%
leave it to
 
02:46:33.670 --> 02:46:33.680 align:start position:0%
the three people that three groups that
 
02:46:34.870 --> 02:46:34.880 align:start position:0%
have the biggest interest
 
02:46:38.150 --> 02:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
in that in this as sort of selecting who
 
02:46:40.230 --> 02:46:40.240 align:start position:0%
is there windham and the secretary of
 
02:46:41.429 --> 02:46:41.439 align:start position:0%
state's office
 
02:46:43.830 --> 02:46:43.840 align:start position:0%
so representative sweeney with a motion
 
02:46:45.429 --> 02:46:45.439 align:start position:0%
to amend the amendment be in order
 
02:46:48.630 --> 02:46:48.640 align:start position:0%
we will i will entertain that subject to
 
02:46:50.550 --> 02:46:50.560 align:start position:0%
moving an amendment on the amendment for
 
02:46:52.630 --> 02:46:52.640 align:start position:0%
the amendment let's see
 
02:46:54.309 --> 02:46:54.319 align:start position:0%
if there's anybody else who wants to
 
02:46:55.910 --> 02:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
make a comment representative lane
 
02:46:57.269 --> 02:46:57.279 align:start position:0%
please thank you
 
02:46:59.349 --> 02:46:59.359 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i think you the
 
02:47:01.590 --> 02:47:01.600 align:start position:0%
language was added as representative
 
02:47:01.600 --> 02:47:02.389 align:start position:0%
language was added as representative
mooney

02:47:02.389 --> 02:47:02.399 align:start position:0%
mooney
 
02:47:04.790 --> 02:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
indicated to address some of the
 
02:47:06.550 --> 02:47:06.560 align:start position:0%
concerns that were raised by the town of
 
02:47:07.590 --> 02:47:07.600 align:start position:0%
wyndham and that
 
02:47:12.309 --> 02:47:12.319 align:start position:0%
pop that show up in uh amendment 6
 
02:47:16.429 --> 02:47:16.439 align:start position:0%
3 8 h um i i think it was to avoid
 
02:47:16.439 --> 02:47:17.590 align:start position:0%
3 8 h um i i think it was to avoid
impropriety

02:47:17.590 --> 02:47:17.600 align:start position:0%
impropriety
 
02:47:22.630 --> 02:47:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:24.630 --> 02:47:24.640 align:start position:0%
so that people trusted that there would
 
02:47:27.269 --> 02:47:27.279 align:start position:0%
not be the people who actually conducted
 
02:47:30.230 --> 02:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
the recount and conducted the hand count
 
02:47:31.510 --> 02:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
the night of the election
 
02:47:33.990 --> 02:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
were not directly involved and i think
 
02:47:35.910 --> 02:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
that's where their concern came from
 
02:47:38.710 --> 02:47:38.720 align:start position:0%
but if we can address that and we feel
 
02:47:40.630 --> 02:47:40.640 align:start position:0%
comfortable by taking it out that the
 
02:47:40.640 --> 02:47:43.110 align:start position:0%
comfortable by taking it out that the
process

02:47:43.110 --> 02:47:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:45.990 --> 02:47:46.000 align:start position:0%
will be will be you know transparent i
 
02:47:47.510 --> 02:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
think that was what they were trying to
 
02:47:48.309 --> 02:47:48.319 align:start position:0%
get at
 
02:47:49.590 --> 02:47:49.600 align:start position:0%
just to answer some of the questions
 
02:47:52.550 --> 02:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
that came up and if we delete them
 
02:47:53.990 --> 02:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
i guess my question is are we
 
02:47:55.750 --> 02:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
comfortable that that addresses the
 
02:47:58.309 --> 02:47:58.319 align:start position:0%
transparency issue that was raised
 
02:48:00.389 --> 02:48:00.399 align:start position:0%
well i think the transparency issue was
 
02:48:02.630 --> 02:48:02.640 align:start position:0%
raised by windham so to that extent they
 
02:48:04.230 --> 02:48:04.240 align:start position:0%
need to pick the right people there that
 
02:48:06.870 --> 02:48:06.880 align:start position:0%
they want to have there
 
02:48:10.309 --> 02:48:10.319 align:start position:0%
if they're concerned about it i
 
02:48:12.550 --> 02:48:12.560 align:start position:0%
why should i be deciding that for for
 
02:48:12.560 --> 02:48:14.150 align:start position:0%
why should i be deciding that for for
window

02:48:14.150 --> 02:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
window
 
02:48:15.910 --> 02:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
and the same thing for the secretary of
 
02:48:17.670 --> 02:48:17.680 align:start position:0%
state's office if they're concerned
 
02:48:19.590 --> 02:48:19.600 align:start position:0%
about the secretary of state's and ag's
 
02:48:21.190 --> 02:48:21.200 align:start position:0%
office is concerned about the appearance
 
02:48:22.870 --> 02:48:22.880 align:start position:0%
of impropriety
 
02:48:26.230 --> 02:48:26.240 align:start position:0%
and they should be um i think once we
 
02:48:27.429 --> 02:48:27.439 align:start position:0%
start picking who we
 
02:48:29.429 --> 02:48:29.439 align:start position:0%
think creates an appearance of
 
02:48:30.950 --> 02:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
impropriety i think we have lots of
 
02:48:32.630 --> 02:48:32.640 align:start position:0%
other people who might think appearances
 
02:48:34.550 --> 02:48:34.560 align:start position:0%
have been propriety or raised by other
 
02:48:35.269 --> 02:48:35.279 align:start position:0%
people that
 
02:48:39.990 --> 02:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
don't require us um and
 
02:48:43.190 --> 02:48:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:47.510 --> 02:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
and to the extent lh s and i i'm not
 
02:48:49.590 --> 02:48:49.600 align:start position:0%
i'm sort of willing to go to the map on
 
02:48:51.429 --> 02:48:51.439 align:start position:0%
b and c coming out
 
02:48:54.550 --> 02:48:54.560 align:start position:0%
i'm not so stuck on a because i think
 
02:48:57.990 --> 02:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
lhs can view it live streamed or
 
02:49:00.469 --> 02:49:00.479 align:start position:0%
be a part of it and the forensic audit
 
02:49:01.910 --> 02:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
team in my opinion should have the
 
02:49:04.469 --> 02:49:04.479 align:start position:0%
ability to access anybody they want
 
02:49:07.110 --> 02:49:07.120 align:start position:0%
so if it turns out would this mean that
 
02:49:08.790 --> 02:49:08.800 align:start position:0%
as part of the forensic audit team they
 
02:49:10.950 --> 02:49:10.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to ask the moderator and window
 
02:49:12.230 --> 02:49:12.240 align:start position:0%
something that went on
 
02:49:14.150 --> 02:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
i'm afraid that this would we're
 
02:49:16.389 --> 02:49:16.399 align:start position:0%
picturing the actual process being in a
 
02:49:17.910 --> 02:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
room and people being there
 
02:49:20.230 --> 02:49:20.240 align:start position:0%
just prohibit them from contacting them
 
02:49:21.269 --> 02:49:21.279 align:start position:0%
as part
 
02:49:24.070 --> 02:49:24.080 align:start position:0%
of the audit process and i think we need
 
02:49:27.110 --> 02:49:27.120 align:start position:0%
to be careful about that because i think
 
02:49:29.110 --> 02:49:29.120 align:start position:0%
it would potentially prevent them from
 
02:49:30.389 --> 02:49:30.399 align:start position:0%
even contacting
 
02:49:32.710 --> 02:49:32.720 align:start position:0%
lhs associates in regards to the machine
 
02:49:34.790 --> 02:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
parts of the machine
 
02:49:37.349 --> 02:49:37.359 align:start position:0%
so i think the burden of impropriety is
 
02:49:37.830 --> 02:49:37.840 align:start position:0%
out of
 
02:49:39.910 --> 02:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
our hands and it should be given to the
 
02:49:41.030 --> 02:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
people who have the most
 
02:49:43.910 --> 02:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
interest in infatuating a good outcome
 
02:49:44.389 --> 02:49:44.399 align:start position:0%
of this
 
02:49:46.309 --> 02:49:46.319 align:start position:0%
audit representative sweeney did you
 
02:49:47.750 --> 02:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
have a question
 
02:49:50.870 --> 02:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
representative thank you madam chair
 
02:49:52.469 --> 02:49:52.479 align:start position:0%
i personally don't have a problem with
 
02:49:54.309 --> 02:49:54.319 align:start position:0%
the language the way it is i understand
 
02:49:55.670 --> 02:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
what you're saying
 
02:49:58.790 --> 02:49:58.800 align:start position:0%
um to me
 
02:50:01.110 --> 02:50:01.120 align:start position:0%
it is it is very important in light of
 
02:50:01.830 --> 02:50:01.840 align:start position:0%
what's happened
 
02:50:03.269 --> 02:50:03.279 align:start position:0%
in light of the feedback we've done in
 
02:50:05.110 --> 02:50:05.120 align:start position:0%
this to avoid the
 
02:50:08.389 --> 02:50:08.399 align:start position:0%
appearance of impropriety um
 
02:50:10.070 --> 02:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
the ad language interview itself doesn't
 
02:50:12.230 --> 02:50:12.240 align:start position:0%
limit from what i can tell
 
02:50:14.790 --> 02:50:14.800 align:start position:0%
the ability for the forensic experts to
 
02:50:14.800 --> 02:50:16.870 align:start position:0%
the ability for the forensic experts to
consult

02:50:16.870 --> 02:50:16.880 align:start position:0%
consult
 
02:50:18.870 --> 02:50:18.880 align:start position:0%
with all three of those people on the
 
02:50:18.880 --> 02:50:19.910 align:start position:0%
with all three of those people on the
matter

02:50:19.910 --> 02:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
matter
 
02:50:21.750 --> 02:50:21.760 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't prevent them from from
 
02:50:24.550 --> 02:50:24.560 align:start position:0%
picking anybody else any other
 
02:50:28.230 --> 02:50:28.240 align:start position:0%
entities that they need to i think it's
 
02:50:30.070 --> 02:50:30.080 align:start position:0%
it adds
 
02:50:32.790 --> 02:50:32.800 align:start position:0%
a little stronger language to the fact
 
02:50:34.070 --> 02:50:34.080 align:start position:0%
that we take
 
02:50:37.910 --> 02:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
impropriety seriously and
 
02:50:39.590 --> 02:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
it makes it a little cleaner in my mind
 
02:50:41.110 --> 02:50:41.120 align:start position:0%
and you know i'm not
 
02:50:44.070 --> 02:50:44.080 align:start position:0%
opposed to taking vnc but i i don't
 
02:50:45.349 --> 02:50:45.359 align:start position:0%
really have a problem with the way it is
 
02:50:46.309 --> 02:50:46.319 align:start position:0%
i just want to
 
02:50:55.860 --> 02:50:55.870 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:55.870 --> 02:51:02.710 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

02:51:02.710 --> 02:51:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:07.750 --> 02:51:07.760 align:start position:0%
making it um representative ward
 
02:51:09.110 --> 02:51:09.120 align:start position:0%
well i'd just like to say that i would
 
02:51:11.110 --> 02:51:11.120 align:start position:0%
agree with retaining
 
02:51:14.070 --> 02:51:14.080 align:start position:0%
all three sections a b and c they seem
 
02:51:15.429 --> 02:51:15.439 align:start position:0%
we're going to go through this entire
 
02:51:16.870 --> 02:51:16.880 align:start position:0%
process we might as well
 
02:51:20.710 --> 02:51:20.720 align:start position:0%
include those restrictions
 
02:51:23.030 --> 02:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
i need to tell you that i i don't
 
02:51:24.950 --> 02:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
windham has specifically said that they
 
02:51:26.469 --> 02:51:26.479 align:start position:0%
are going to want
 
02:51:29.510 --> 02:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
um people there and you don't get to
 
02:51:31.429 --> 02:51:31.439 align:start position:0%
pick who you think the other side thinks
 
02:51:32.150 --> 02:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
it's improper
 
02:51:32.160 --> 02:51:36.469 align:start position:0%
it's improper
representative

02:51:36.469 --> 02:51:36.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:42.309 --> 02:51:42.319 align:start position:0%
if we take lines 12-17 out
 
02:51:48.790 --> 02:51:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:50.710 --> 02:51:50.720 align:start position:0%
and if we leave them in there's nothing
 
02:51:52.230 --> 02:51:52.240 align:start position:0%
to prevent the
 
02:51:54.550 --> 02:51:54.560 align:start position:0%
producers from consulting whoever they
 
02:51:55.670 --> 02:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
wish that they need technical
 
02:51:55.680 --> 02:51:57.590 align:start position:0%
wish that they need technical
information

02:51:57.590 --> 02:51:57.600 align:start position:0%
information
 
02:51:59.429 --> 02:51:59.439 align:start position:0%
process information is that right am i
 
02:52:01.429 --> 02:52:01.439 align:start position:0%
interpreting this right right
 
02:52:03.030 --> 02:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
is it separation this is about just
 
02:52:05.269 --> 02:52:05.279 align:start position:0%
public access
 
02:52:07.830 --> 02:52:07.840 align:start position:0%
this is about public access and whether
 
02:52:09.590 --> 02:52:09.600 align:start position:0%
or not wyndham and the secretary of
 
02:52:09.600 --> 02:52:10.469 align:start position:0%
or not wyndham and the secretary of
state

02:52:10.469 --> 02:52:10.479 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:52:14.070 --> 02:52:14.080 align:start position:0%
can have whoever they want again
 
02:52:17.510 --> 02:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
that's really what this is about
 
02:52:19.830 --> 02:52:19.840 align:start position:0%
and if you've ever been to a recount
 
02:52:21.830 --> 02:52:21.840 align:start position:0%
there is a significant amount of people
 
02:52:21.840 --> 02:52:22.550 align:start position:0%
there is a significant amount of people
present

02:52:22.550 --> 02:52:22.560 align:start position:0%
present
 
02:52:25.349 --> 02:52:25.359 align:start position:0%
at wheathouse and i think it could
 
02:52:25.359 --> 02:52:26.070 align:start position:0%
at wheathouse and i think it could
eliminate

02:52:26.070 --> 02:52:26.080 align:start position:0%
eliminate
 
02:52:28.469 --> 02:52:28.479 align:start position:0%
a fair amount of people as i said the
 
02:52:30.630 --> 02:52:30.640 align:start position:0%
secretary of state and the deputy
 
02:52:34.230 --> 02:52:34.240 align:start position:0%
and some of their staff and it would
 
02:52:37.269 --> 02:52:37.279 align:start position:0%
eliminate the moderator the town clerk
 
02:52:39.670 --> 02:52:39.680 align:start position:0%
and anybody who touched a ballot in
 
02:52:39.680 --> 02:52:40.630 align:start position:0%
and anybody who touched a ballot in
windom

02:52:40.630 --> 02:52:40.640 align:start position:0%
windom
 
02:52:45.750 --> 02:52:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:47.030 --> 02:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
do we know anything about the seating
 
02:52:48.389 --> 02:52:48.399 align:start position:0%
arrangements for members of the public
 
02:52:49.590 --> 02:52:49.600 align:start position:0%
building no you don't know
 
02:52:52.389 --> 02:52:52.399 align:start position:0%
separated from under the i'm assuming
 
02:52:53.429 --> 02:52:53.439 align:start position:0%
that the forensic
 
02:52:55.349 --> 02:52:55.359 align:start position:0%
team will want them separated but that's
 
02:52:56.469 --> 02:52:56.479 align:start position:0%
why we've got
 
02:53:00.230 --> 02:53:00.240 align:start position:0%
the selection for members of the public
 
02:53:02.070 --> 02:53:02.080 align:start position:0%
i would presume that that's why the
 
02:53:03.429 --> 02:53:03.439 align:start position:0%
member the people on this
 
02:53:07.910 --> 02:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
left it up to them and um
 
02:53:10.070 --> 02:53:10.080 align:start position:0%
the forensic audit team is in charge of
 
02:53:11.590 --> 02:53:11.600 align:start position:0%
the actual
 
02:53:13.510 --> 02:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
conduct in space i would assume they're
 
02:53:14.870 --> 02:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
going to want to coordinate the area
 
02:53:15.349 --> 02:53:15.359 align:start position:0%
that the
 
02:53:16.790 --> 02:53:16.800 align:start position:0%
audit and the ballots are being touched
 
02:53:18.070 --> 02:53:18.080 align:start position:0%
you're not going to want anybody in the
 
02:53:19.590 --> 02:53:19.600 align:start position:0%
area that the ballots are
 
02:53:22.309 --> 02:53:22.319 align:start position:0%
i mean they have a personal statement
 
02:53:24.309 --> 02:53:24.319 align:start position:0%
the outcome of this also
 
02:53:26.630 --> 02:53:26.640 align:start position:0%
and i apologize for raising this issue
 
02:53:26.640 --> 02:53:27.429 align:start position:0%
and i apologize for raising this issue
but

02:53:27.429 --> 02:53:27.439 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:53:32.790 --> 02:53:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:36.309 --> 02:53:36.319 align:start position:0%
it's important that frankly
 
02:53:38.309 --> 02:53:38.319 align:start position:0%
the secretary of the state is allowed to
 
02:53:40.230 --> 02:53:40.240 align:start position:0%
be present in the building when this
 
02:53:44.950 --> 02:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:47.429 --> 02:53:47.439 align:start position:0%
representative o'brien thank you ma'am
 
02:53:47.439 --> 02:53:48.070 align:start position:0%
representative o'brien thank you ma'am
it

02:53:48.070 --> 02:53:48.080 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:53:52.309 --> 02:53:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:55.670 --> 02:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
under section c that members of
 
02:53:59.110 --> 02:53:59.120 align:start position:0%
of the secretary of state staff that are
 
02:54:02.150 --> 02:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
well versed in running recounts
 
02:54:05.429 --> 02:54:05.439 align:start position:0%
and and such would not be they happen to
 
02:54:06.309 --> 02:54:06.319 align:start position:0%
have been
 
02:54:09.510 --> 02:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
involved in any way uh on the november
 
02:54:09.520 --> 02:54:10.070 align:start position:0%
involved in any way uh on the november
12th

02:54:10.070 --> 02:54:10.080 align:start position:0%
12th
 
02:54:13.429 --> 02:54:13.439 align:start position:0%
recount they would not be allowed to
 
02:54:15.590 --> 02:54:15.600 align:start position:0%
be involved in this they would not be
 
02:54:16.790 --> 02:54:16.800 align:start position:0%
able to be present
 
02:54:19.349 --> 02:54:19.359 align:start position:0%
at any time based on this language and
 
02:54:19.359 --> 02:54:19.830 align:start position:0%
at any time based on this language and
follow

02:54:19.830 --> 02:54:19.840 align:start position:0%
follow
 
02:54:23.670 --> 02:54:23.680 align:start position:0%
a follow-up to is that going to create a
 
02:54:23.680 --> 02:54:24.389 align:start position:0%
a follow-up to is that going to create a
staffing

02:54:24.389 --> 02:54:24.399 align:start position:0%
staffing
 
02:54:27.830 --> 02:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
problem for them to complete this task
 
02:54:29.269 --> 02:54:29.279 align:start position:0%
i don't know the forensic audit team
 
02:54:30.870 --> 02:54:30.880 align:start position:0%
would be in charge of who they wanted to
 
02:54:31.670 --> 02:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
do the test
 
02:54:35.429 --> 02:54:35.439 align:start position:0%
representative lane yes thank you
 
02:54:39.030 --> 02:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
uh manager um i i think
 
02:54:40.790 --> 02:54:40.800 align:start position:0%
we're we're tending to read this in
 
02:54:42.309 --> 02:54:42.319 align:start position:0%
isolation because we do
 
02:54:45.510 --> 02:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
have the auditors selected and the
 
02:54:47.190 --> 02:54:47.200 align:start position:0%
secretary of state
 
02:54:50.389 --> 02:54:50.399 align:start position:0%
um gets to pick and the a.g pick one
 
02:54:52.550 --> 02:54:52.560 align:start position:0%
of the members of the team and the town
 
02:54:53.830 --> 02:54:53.840 align:start position:0%
picks a member and then they
 
02:54:56.309 --> 02:54:56.319 align:start position:0%
those two pick the third member and they
 
02:54:58.230 --> 02:54:58.240 align:start position:0%
set up how they're going to do the audit
 
02:55:00.070 --> 02:55:00.080 align:start position:0%
and who they're going to meet with
 
02:55:01.830 --> 02:55:01.840 align:start position:0%
and how they're going to do the audit
 
02:55:04.230 --> 02:55:04.240 align:start position:0%
and who they talk to
 
02:55:06.870 --> 02:55:06.880 align:start position:0%
if it's creating an issue i guess i'm
 
02:55:06.880 --> 02:55:07.510 align:start position:0%
if it's creating an issue i guess i'm
not

02:55:07.510 --> 02:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:55:09.990 --> 02:55:10.000 align:start position:0%
like you i'm not willing to forego the
 
02:55:12.150 --> 02:55:12.160 align:start position:0%
whole bill because of these sections i
 
02:55:12.160 --> 02:55:12.710 align:start position:0%
whole bill because of these sections i
just

02:55:12.710 --> 02:55:12.720 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:55:15.349 --> 02:55:15.359 align:start position:0%
we put it in to honor some of the things
 
02:55:17.429 --> 02:55:17.439 align:start position:0%
that the town of wyndham had asked for
 
02:55:19.670 --> 02:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
but i think there are other safeguards
 
02:55:22.230 --> 02:55:22.240 align:start position:0%
to give them that transparency
 
02:55:24.469 --> 02:55:24.479 align:start position:0%
so i don't think taking it out
 
02:55:24.479 --> 02:55:25.830 align:start position:0%
so i don't think taking it out
necessarily

02:55:25.830 --> 02:55:25.840 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
02:55:28.309 --> 02:55:28.319 align:start position:0%
eliminates the transparency because the
 
02:55:28.319 --> 02:55:28.950 align:start position:0%
eliminates the transparency because the
audit

02:55:28.950 --> 02:55:28.960 align:start position:0%
audit
 
02:55:31.830 --> 02:55:31.840 align:start position:0%
team has to be transparent about their
 
02:55:31.840 --> 02:55:33.190 align:start position:0%
team has to be transparent about their
methodology

02:55:33.190 --> 02:55:33.200 align:start position:0%
methodology
 
02:55:37.590 --> 02:55:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:39.750 --> 02:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
just to reassure everybody i'm not sure
 
02:55:41.510 --> 02:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
that we this is the only thing that's
 
02:55:44.309 --> 02:55:44.319 align:start position:0%
giving us transparency
 
02:55:46.309 --> 02:55:46.319 align:start position:0%
so i guess representative lane is one of
 
02:55:47.670 --> 02:55:47.680 align:start position:0%
the sponsors on the bill
 
02:55:51.830 --> 02:55:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:55.590 --> 02:55:55.600 align:start position:0%
what is your position on what should we
 
02:55:59.030 --> 02:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
can or needs to be left in right i mean
 
02:55:59.040 --> 02:55:59.510 align:start position:0%
can or needs to be left in right i mean
i

02:55:59.510 --> 02:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:56:02.389 --> 02:56:02.399 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm also a little bit concerned
 
02:56:03.030 --> 02:56:03.040 align:start position:0%
about a
 
02:56:04.870 --> 02:56:04.880 align:start position:0%
because if they do want them there if
 
02:56:06.630 --> 02:56:06.640 align:start position:0%
there's a if there's a glitch with the
 
02:56:08.710 --> 02:56:08.720 align:start position:0%
machines at the thing do they want
 
02:56:10.469 --> 02:56:10.479 align:start position:0%
somebody there from that company to try
 
02:56:11.990 --> 02:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
and explain it not necessarily
 
02:56:13.670 --> 02:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
to fiddle with the machine but to
 
02:56:15.190 --> 02:56:15.200 align:start position:0%
explain what's going on
 
02:56:19.910 --> 02:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:21.510 --> 02:56:21.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative lane and i
 
02:56:23.510 --> 02:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
think that was my position when i saw
 
02:56:26.710 --> 02:56:26.720 align:start position:0%
the yes my concern when i saw the
 
02:56:28.309 --> 02:56:28.319 align:start position:0%
distinction that if we're leaving this
 
02:56:31.349 --> 02:56:31.359 align:start position:0%
to the um audit team we should leave it
 
02:56:34.469 --> 02:56:34.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:37.750 --> 02:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
representative i think it's i agree
 
02:56:40.630 --> 02:56:40.640 align:start position:0%
with madam chair i think it's okay to
 
02:56:42.870 --> 02:56:42.880 align:start position:0%
not have sections b and c or even a b
 
02:56:43.990 --> 02:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
and c
 
02:56:46.469 --> 02:56:46.479 align:start position:0%
these are observers in this section and
 
02:56:48.150 --> 02:56:48.160 align:start position:0%
public access to observing
 
02:56:50.469 --> 02:56:50.479 align:start position:0%
the audit is what we might say in line
 
02:56:53.030 --> 02:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
five of page two
 
02:56:54.710 --> 02:56:54.720 align:start position:0%
and we have public access to observing
 
02:56:56.230 --> 02:56:56.240 align:start position:0%
the audit so that
 
02:56:58.950 --> 02:56:58.960 align:start position:0%
so that the process is transparent and
 
02:57:00.550 --> 02:57:00.560 align:start position:0%
and the people who are chosen
 
02:57:02.150 --> 02:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
you know are decided by windham
 
02:57:04.070 --> 02:57:04.080 align:start position:0%
designees designees of the secretary of
 
02:57:04.080 --> 02:57:04.950 align:start position:0%
designees designees of the secretary of
state

02:57:04.950 --> 02:57:04.960 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:57:06.790 --> 02:57:06.800 align:start position:0%
and ag and members of the public there
 
02:57:08.469 --> 02:57:08.479 align:start position:0%
are three groups that get to choose who
 
02:57:09.990 --> 02:57:10.000 align:start position:0%
are observers
 
02:57:11.269 --> 02:57:11.279 align:start position:0%
and totally different from who's
 
02:57:12.710 --> 02:57:12.720 align:start position:0%
participating in the process which is
 
02:57:13.510 --> 02:57:13.520 align:start position:0%
page one
 
02:57:15.750 --> 02:57:15.760 align:start position:0%
you know line nine and so i think it's
 
02:57:17.510 --> 02:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
you know fine not to have those i don't
 
02:57:18.150 --> 02:57:18.160 align:start position:0%
think this
 
02:57:21.910 --> 02:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
those sections need to be there
 
02:57:21.920 --> 02:57:26.389 align:start position:0%
those sections need to be there
discussion

02:57:26.389 --> 02:57:26.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:28.710 --> 02:57:28.720 align:start position:0%
all right representative rowan madam
 
02:57:29.670 --> 02:57:29.680 align:start position:0%
chair i think
 
02:57:33.910 --> 02:57:33.920 align:start position:0%
this section by excluding
 
02:57:37.349 --> 02:57:37.359 align:start position:0%
these groups literally from the building
 
02:57:40.469 --> 02:57:40.479 align:start position:0%
during the audit would certainly exclude
 
02:57:42.550 --> 02:57:42.560 align:start position:0%
key people from wyndham from even being
 
02:57:43.510 --> 02:57:43.520 align:start position:0%
in the building
 
02:57:46.790 --> 02:57:46.800 align:start position:0%
the way i rated it would exclude the
 
02:57:48.550 --> 02:57:48.560 align:start position:0%
anybody from the secretary of state's
 
02:57:50.710 --> 02:57:50.720 align:start position:0%
office who was involved in recount
 
02:57:53.030 --> 02:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
from being in the building it would
 
02:57:54.230 --> 02:57:54.240 align:start position:0%
exclude lhs
 
02:57:57.190 --> 02:57:57.200 align:start position:0%
associates who might be needed to answer
 
02:57:58.389 --> 02:57:58.399 align:start position:0%
questions of
 
02:58:00.630 --> 02:58:00.640 align:start position:0%
from the forensic auditors from being in
 
02:58:01.590 --> 02:58:01.600 align:start position:0%
the building
 
02:58:04.710 --> 02:58:04.720 align:start position:0%
and i think that this would handcuff
 
02:58:08.150 --> 02:58:08.160 align:start position:0%
the forensic auditor so i
 
02:58:11.269 --> 02:58:11.279 align:start position:0%
i would move that we remove starting in
 
02:58:11.279 --> 02:58:11.670 align:start position:0%
i would move that we remove starting in
line

02:58:11.670 --> 02:58:11.680 align:start position:0%
line
 
02:58:14.870 --> 02:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
10 with to avoid
 
02:58:19.269 --> 02:58:19.279 align:start position:0%
through line 17 we removed from
 
02:58:22.469 --> 02:58:22.479 align:start position:0%
this amendment is there a second i will

further discussion representative
 
03:00:35.910 --> 03:00:35.920 align:start position:0%
manager i believe that we
 
03:00:38.550 --> 03:00:38.560 align:start position:0%
uh further amend the amendment uh by
 
03:00:38.560 --> 03:00:39.110 align:start position:0%
uh further amend the amendment uh by
changing

03:00:39.110 --> 03:00:39.120 align:start position:0%
changing
 
03:00:42.870 --> 03:00:42.880 align:start position:0%
on the first page line 27
 
03:00:45.190 --> 03:00:45.200 align:start position:0%
remove the race for governor and replace
 
03:00:46.950 --> 03:00:46.960 align:start position:0%
it with the race for president and vice
 
03:00:49.510 --> 03:00:49.520 align:start position:0%
president of the united states
 
03:00:52.469 --> 03:00:52.479 align:start position:0%
is there a second to that motion i'll
 
03:00:54.469 --> 03:00:54.479 align:start position:0%
second it
 
03:00:56.230 --> 03:00:56.240 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to your motion i
 
03:00:57.510 --> 03:00:57.520 align:start position:0%
would i think the
 
03:00:59.830 --> 03:00:59.840 align:start position:0%
the people that are looking for the
 
03:01:00.870 --> 03:01:00.880 align:start position:0%
window results
 
03:01:03.190 --> 03:01:03.200 align:start position:0%
i think most people that go to the polls
 
03:01:05.190 --> 03:01:05.200 align:start position:0%
and we see this time and time again
 
03:01:07.830 --> 03:01:07.840 align:start position:0%
vote for president and vice president
 
03:01:09.830 --> 03:01:09.840 align:start position:0%
and then they drop off the vow
 
03:01:13.030 --> 03:01:13.040 align:start position:0%
um i think by if we do a hand tally of
 
03:01:14.630 --> 03:01:14.640 align:start position:0%
the ballot's castle in them
 
03:01:16.389 --> 03:01:16.399 align:start position:0%
for the president and vice president for
 
03:01:18.070 --> 03:01:18.080 align:start position:0%
the united states senate race
 
03:01:19.670 --> 03:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
and then the district seven state
 
03:01:21.670 --> 03:01:21.680 align:start position:0%
representative race will get a more
 
03:01:24.070 --> 03:01:24.080 align:start position:0%
fully encompassing uh version of the
 
03:01:25.110 --> 03:01:25.120 align:start position:0%

have contacted ols in regards to
 
03:34:16.070 --> 03:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
making that deletion in the hopes we
 
03:34:17.110 --> 03:34:17.120 align:start position:0%
might actually have
 
03:34:19.990 --> 03:34:20.000 align:start position:0%
a new amendment number but i don't
 
03:34:20.000 --> 03:34:21.590 align:start position:0%
a new amendment number but i don't
believe

03:34:21.590 --> 03:34:21.600 align:start position:0%
believe
 
03:34:24.950 --> 03:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
you do at this time
 
03:34:26.790 --> 03:34:26.800 align:start position:0%
i fortunately have not been involved in

03:34:33.349 --> 03:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
things even more
 
03:34:36.950 --> 03:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
but um one of our
 
03:34:39.670 --> 03:34:39.680 align:start position:0%
one of my colleagues caught an error i
 
03:34:39.680 --> 03:34:41.030 align:start position:0%
one of my colleagues caught an error i
think

03:34:41.030 --> 03:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
think
 
03:34:42.710 --> 03:34:42.720 align:start position:0%
something that should be added on line
 
03:34:45.269 --> 03:34:45.279 align:start position:0%
five page two
 
03:34:48.469 --> 03:34:48.479 align:start position:0%
uh towards the end to add the words to
 
03:34:51.590 --> 03:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
observe after the word numbers so in
 
03:34:53.830 --> 03:34:53.840 align:start position:0%
other words it would say public access
 
03:34:54.630 --> 03:34:54.640 align:start position:0%
to the audit
 
03:34:57.190 --> 03:34:57.200 align:start position:0%
shall be granted in equal mo mem and
 
03:34:59.269 --> 03:34:59.279 align:start position:0%
equal numbers to observe
 
03:35:02.550 --> 03:35:02.560 align:start position:0%
as is deemed so i would make the motion
 
03:35:05.830 --> 03:35:05.840 align:start position:0%
to add those words to observe
 
03:35:08.630 --> 03:35:08.640 align:start position:0%
is there a second to your motion
 
03:35:09.990 --> 03:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
representative hamlet
 
03:35:14.389 --> 03:35:14.399 align:start position:0%
seconds yes i second that
 
03:35:17.750 --> 03:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
thank you um representative lane
 
03:35:19.190 --> 03:35:19.200 align:start position:0%
did you want to speak any more to that
 
03:35:21.269 --> 03:35:21.279 align:start position:0%
motion i don't
 
03:35:23.269 --> 03:35:23.279 align:start position:0%
think so madam chair it just it's
 
03:35:24.870 --> 03:35:24.880 align:start position:0%
exactly what we were talking about i
 
03:35:26.229 --> 03:35:26.239 align:start position:0%
think it kind of came up when we were
 
03:35:28.150 --> 03:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
talking about the lines 10 and a half
 
03:35:29.750 --> 03:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
through 17 just to make it clear that
 
03:35:31.190 --> 03:35:31.200 align:start position:0%
they were observing
 
03:35:33.910 --> 03:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
so i will just point out that i really
 
03:35:35.510 --> 03:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
don't want to test this theory that if
 
03:35:37.030 --> 03:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
you put a couple of lawyers looking at a
 
03:35:38.389 --> 03:35:38.399 align:start position:0%
document you can never
 
03:35:41.510 --> 03:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
finalize it well it wasn't me
 
03:35:44.070 --> 03:35:44.080 align:start position:0%
i it wasn't me it was actually one of
 
03:35:46.070 --> 03:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
the non-lawyers
 
03:35:49.510 --> 03:35:49.520 align:start position:0%

03:42:22.229 --> 03:42:22.239 align:start position:0%
normally i would put this on the consent
 
03:42:24.710 --> 03:42:24.720 align:start position:0%
calendar i guess i'd watch the consensus
 
03:42:25.590 --> 03:42:25.600 align:start position:0%
of the committee
 
03:42:27.429 --> 03:42:27.439 align:start position:0%
as to whether or not you think this will
 
03:42:29.510 --> 03:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
be full for debate
 
03:42:32.150 --> 03:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
um in which case i would then ask it to
 
03:42:32.160 --> 03:42:33.110 align:start position:0%
um in which case i would then ask it to
go

03:42:33.110 --> 03:42:33.120 align:start position:0%
go
 
03:42:35.349 --> 03:42:35.359 align:start position:0%

03:42:41.590 --> 03:42:41.600 align:start position:0%
chairman i i believe this should go on
 
03:42:43.349 --> 03:42:43.359 align:start position:0%
the consent calendar if um
 
03:42:45.189 --> 03:42:45.199 align:start position:0%
representatives feel so impassioned
 
03:42:46.309 --> 03:42:46.319 align:start position:0%
