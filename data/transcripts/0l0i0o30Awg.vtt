00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
if I may yeah sorry and just a reminder
 
00:06:59.689 --> 00:06:59.699 align:start position:0%
we are streaming so we wouldn't need to
 
00:07:01.909 --> 00:07:01.919 align:start position:0%
use the mics just so it picks up on the
 
00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
streaming that's okay I mean we can hear
 
00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:05.340 align:start position:0%
each other in the room of course but for
 
00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
the streaming audience uh so yes um real
 
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
quick Mickey Landry most of you have
 
00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:12.300 align:start position:0%
worked with me in the past a few of you
 
00:07:13.969 --> 00:07:13.979 align:start position:0%
are new faces so I just wanted to do a
 
00:07:16.309 --> 00:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
quick introduction there as far as bills
 
00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
go I think that is incredibly wise to to
 
00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:20.520 align:start position:0%
have hearings and schedule work sessions
 
00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:22.020 align:start position:0%
and review those while we're waiting for
 
00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:24.900 align:start position:0%
the budget as far as uh the public
 
00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:27.240 align:start position:0%
hearings no more than 30 minutes between
 
00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:29.880 align:start position:0%
would be fine maybe even 15 minutes or a
 
00:07:31.309 --> 00:07:31.319 align:start position:0%
couple of the ones that I know we have
 
00:07:32.809 --> 00:07:32.819 align:start position:0%
one relative just local school budgets
 
00:07:34.969 --> 00:07:34.979 align:start position:0%
I'd probably be a big or a quick public
 
00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:36.660 align:start position:0%
carrying the school building Aid ones
 
00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:39.180 align:start position:0%
would probably be longer and then based
 
00:07:40.309 --> 00:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
on those public hearings and the
 
00:07:41.629 --> 00:07:41.639 align:start position:0%
testimony and the issues that are
 
00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:42.840 align:start position:0%
brought forward we'll probably let you
 
00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:44.580 align:start position:0%
know how many work sessions that you
 
00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:46.440 align:start position:0%
would need if you could get it done in
 
00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:47.940 align:start position:0%
one work session or you would need
 
00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:49.370 align:start position:0%
one work session or you would need
multiple

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:49.380 align:start position:0%
multiple
 
00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:53.930 align:start position:0%
multiple
um

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:53.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:55.860 align:start position:0%
I don't have a bill list in front of me
 
00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:57.240 align:start position:0%
but I think there was at least two
 
00:07:59.089 --> 00:07:59.099 align:start position:0%
School building Aid related bills three
 
00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:01.380 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean you'll get a lot of repeat
 
00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:04.020 align:start position:0%
testimony between those so it might be
 
00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:07.560 align:start position:0%
the chair could try to consolidate
 
00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:11.340 align:start position:0%
testimony so those three bills you know
 
00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:14.340 align:start position:0%
if you stack them as far as when they're
 
00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
scheduled you could because it's the
 
00:08:17.809 --> 00:08:17.819 align:start position:0%
same policy just different dollar
 
00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:21.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:24.529 --> 00:08:24.539 align:start position:0%
yeah if you I mean I'm not sure if it's
 
00:08:26.089 --> 00:08:26.099 align:start position:0%
permissible to schedule the same build
 
00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:28.620 align:start position:0%
the same exact time but the chair could
 
00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:30.900 align:start position:0%
just direct those testifying that if you
 
00:08:32.389 --> 00:08:32.399 align:start position:0%
you know your testimony for these three
 
00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:34.620 align:start position:0%
bills will be kind of considered so they
 
00:08:36.649 --> 00:08:36.659 align:start position:0%
don't say the same testimony three times
 
00:08:38.209 --> 00:08:38.219 align:start position:0%
that day which should shorten the
 
00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:40.620 align:start position:0%
overall hearing lengths
 
00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:42.360 align:start position:0%
yeah you I would give at least an hour
 
00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
for those three combined you know so
 
00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:48.540 align:start position:0%
maybe schedule you know 10 10 30 11
 
00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
something like that and then hopefully
 
00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
by after an hour or so all the tests
 
00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:04.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
uh so I I see three I see three bills
 
00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:11.100 align:start position:0%
here that are for school building a one
 
00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:14.100 align:start position:0%
is 332 and that's representative Cahill
 
00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
and one is
 
00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:19.260 align:start position:0%
541 that's representative Wallner
 
00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:23.640 align:start position:0%
and 546 which is representative Ladd
 
00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:25.860 align:start position:0%
jeez I don't see any of those going fast
 
00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:28.320 align:start position:0%
yeah the the the issue of school
 
00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:29.940 align:start position:0%
building Aid will certainly get a lot of
 
00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
testimony those three bills if I recall
 
00:09:33.769 --> 00:09:33.779 align:start position:0%
do have quite a bit of overlap so there
 
00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:34.680 align:start position:0%
wouldn't really really be different
 
00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:37.080 align:start position:0%
testimony for each bill and of course
 
00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:39.000 align:start position:0%
School building will be something that
 
00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:40.200 align:start position:0%
would be considered as part of your
 
00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
budget package I with almost I would
 
00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:45.480 align:start position:0%
almost be certain that the governor's
 
00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:47.100 align:start position:0%
recommended budget will come up with a
 
00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:49.140 align:start position:0%
another policy proposal for school
 
00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:51.420 align:start position:0%
building Aid so what would likely happen
 
00:09:53.509 --> 00:09:53.519 align:start position:0%
is those three bills would either be
 
00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
itl'd or retained whatever the committee
 
00:09:57.290 --> 00:09:57.300 align:start position:0%
wants to do and then whatever the this
 
00:09:59.810 --> 00:09:59.820 align:start position:0%
division's position on school building a
 
00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:01.860 align:start position:0%
would be would be incorporating the
 
00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
house bill one and two so you could
 
00:10:05.389 --> 00:10:05.399 align:start position:0%
really dispose of these bills real early
 
00:10:06.889 --> 00:10:06.899 align:start position:0%
knowing you're going to take care of
 
00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:09.660 align:start position:0%
school building Aid in the budget
 
00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:11.700 align:start position:0%
yeah you could retain that would mean
 
00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:13.140 align:start position:0%
you'd have to meet on them in the summer
 
00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:16.140 align:start position:0%
or you could I yeah
 
00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:18.540 align:start position:0%
correct yep yeah and you have since
 
00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:19.800 align:start position:0%
they're not going to another committee
 
00:10:21.769 --> 00:10:21.779 align:start position:0%
you have technically until crossover to
 
00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:24.660 align:start position:0%
deal with them but um yeah those would
 
00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:26.100 align:start position:0%
most certainly be a probably end up
 
00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
being in House Bill too whatever this
 
00:10:29.389 --> 00:10:29.399 align:start position:0%
division's policy is set on we would do
 
00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:31.500 align:start position:0%
a house bill to Amendment
 
00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
I think you've got
 
00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:37.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:40.850 align:start position:0%
 
correct

00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:40.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:48.060 align:start position:0%
kids it's more of a follow-up on the 129
 
00:10:50.449 --> 00:10:50.459 align:start position:0%
question I I thought that we were pretty
 
00:10:51.949 --> 00:10:51.959 align:start position:0%
much set with the school building stuff
 
00:10:54.889 --> 00:10:54.899 align:start position:0%
and we could bring up 129 or am I too
 
00:10:54.899 --> 00:10:55.930 align:start position:0%
and we could bring up 129 or am I too
early

00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:55.940 align:start position:0%
early
 
00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:02.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:06.300 align:start position:0%
one more question before it
 
00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:08.220 align:start position:0%
um do all of these bills need to have a
 
00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
public hearing or have they already had
 
00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:13.620 align:start position:0%
they had okay they certainly need a
 
00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:15.060 align:start position:0%
public hearing and those are I think
 
00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:16.440 align:start position:0%
what representative Emrick is looking to
 
00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
schedule now and try to figure out how
 
00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
much time to a lot for each one thank
 
00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:21.790 align:start position:0%
much time to a lot for each one thank
you

00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:21.800 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:24.120 align:start position:0%
you're my man
 
00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
um during the last session we used to
 
00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:29.220 align:start position:0%
hear all the bills together
 
00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
um for the hearing so that everyone in
 
00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:33.660 align:start position:0%
the finance committee will we do the
 
00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
same thing or will we have a unique
 
00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
division two hearing
 
00:11:39.889 --> 00:11:39.899 align:start position:0%
I expect we're still doing full Finance
 
00:11:41.389 --> 00:11:41.399 align:start position:0%
public hearings for the bills when
 
00:11:43.009 --> 00:11:43.019 align:start position:0%
they're first referred that would be new
 
00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:45.420 align:start position:0%
to just do a division two hearing I just
 
00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:46.860 align:start position:0%
talked to Ken and I said I'm going to
 
00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
schedule some of these for next week and
 
00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
he said okay
 
00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:51.300 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:53.820 align:start position:0%
I'm kind of lost right now I think I
 
00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:55.380 align:start position:0%
think we'd want to just confirm with the
 
00:11:57.290 --> 00:11:57.300 align:start position:0%
chair generally bills when they first
 
00:11:58.610 --> 00:11:58.620 align:start position:0%
come to the committee and need a hearing
 
00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:00.600 align:start position:0%
it's a full Finance public hearing and
 
00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:01.980 align:start position:0%
then we'll be referred to the division
 
00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:04.740 align:start position:0%
for work sessions yeah we wouldn't have
 
00:12:06.769 --> 00:12:06.779 align:start position:0%
a public input session here necessarily
 
00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:08.160 align:start position:0%
it would be up to the chair to allow for
 
00:12:10.009 --> 00:12:10.019 align:start position:0%
public input but the public opportunity
 
00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:11.700 align:start position:0%
would be in the full committee why don't
 
00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:14.700 align:start position:0%
I go find out from the chart okay
 
00:12:18.009 --> 00:12:18.019 align:start position:0%
so um the bills
 
00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:19.980 align:start position:0%
bills that um
 
00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:22.980 align:start position:0%
had a had a hearing in another committee
 
00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:25.740 align:start position:0%
they don't have to have the a hearing in
 
00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
front of the full committee they just
 
00:12:29.509 --> 00:12:29.519 align:start position:0%
come to a division correct for so if a
 
00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:31.500 align:start position:0%
bill was heard in a public hearing and a
 
00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:33.240 align:start position:0%
another committee and referred here as a
 
00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:34.620 align:start position:0%
second Committee of Public hearings not
 
00:12:37.069 --> 00:12:37.079 align:start position:0%
required okay um the only other time a
 
00:12:38.389 --> 00:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
public hearing would be required if
 
00:12:39.769 --> 00:12:39.779 align:start position:0%
there was a non-germain Amendment
 
00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:41.640 align:start position:0%
something new to that bill but that
 
00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:43.200 align:start position:0%
would be up to the discretion of the
 
00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:45.060 align:start position:0%
house Clerk and the chair I believe okay
 
00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:46.500 align:start position:0%
that would that's nothing we would worry
 
00:12:49.009 --> 00:12:49.019 align:start position:0%
about at least for several weeks right
 
00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
right the non-jamin period
 
00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:56.100 align:start position:0%
when the Niger main bills come in
 
00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:34.620 align:start position:0%
uh yeah and that's that's something that
 
00:13:36.769 --> 00:13:36.779 align:start position:0%
came up if you recall two years ago um
 
00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:38.220 align:start position:0%
when when this division was working on
 
00:13:39.650 --> 00:13:39.660 align:start position:0%
building Aid we were sitting on
 
00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
additional education trust fund dollars
 
00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
and the thought was to expedite those
 
00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:45.300 align:start position:0%
payments and that's certainly something
 
00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:48.240 align:start position:0%
that could be discussed this session as
 
00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:51.769 align:start position:0%
that could be discussed this session as
well

00:13:51.769 --> 00:13:51.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:53.329 --> 00:13:53.339 align:start position:0%
it would be good if we could do that
 
00:13:56.509 --> 00:13:56.519 align:start position:0%
yeah and um you are right that the tail
 
00:13:58.730 --> 00:13:58.740 align:start position:0%
payments are decreasing uh it's set to
 
00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:02.700 align:start position:0%
expire completely in 2042 but the uh the
 
00:14:04.129 --> 00:14:04.139 align:start position:0%
total amount that we have to pay per
 
00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
year is getting less so essentially that
 
00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:07.860 align:start position:0%
could uh present opportunity for new
 
00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:26.889 align:start position:0%
could uh present opportunity for new
projects

00:14:26.889 --> 00:14:26.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:30.540 align:start position:0%
full Finance wheel he'll hear all bills
 
00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:32.700 align:start position:0%
but if we want to get started on them we
 
00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:38.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:41.880 align:start position:0%
food for thought yeah I like the idea
 
00:14:44.569 --> 00:14:44.579 align:start position:0%
um I'm just wondering how that will
 
00:14:44.579 --> 00:14:46.310 align:start position:0%
um I'm just wondering how that will
impact

00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
impact
 
00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:48.540 align:start position:0%
our discussions having that information
 
00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
here and then having it with the full
 
00:14:53.329 --> 00:14:53.339 align:start position:0%
Finance usually we get a sense of full
 
00:14:54.949 --> 00:14:54.959 align:start position:0%
finance and then come here and have that
 
00:14:58.009 --> 00:14:58.019 align:start position:0%
information it I just wonder how yeah I
 
00:14:59.269 --> 00:14:59.279 align:start position:0%
don't have a problem with it I'm really
 
00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:01.500 align:start position:0%
happy to get especially moving some of
 
00:15:04.069 --> 00:15:04.079 align:start position:0%
these bills along but how that's going
 
00:15:05.629 --> 00:15:05.639 align:start position:0%
to impact
 
00:15:09.949 --> 00:15:09.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:13.009 --> 00:15:13.019 align:start position:0%
foreign I don't have any answer I just
 
00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:15.060 align:start position:0%
it's going to it'll it'll just be a
 
00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:25.800 align:start position:0%
we have some time and if you we may not
 
00:15:28.129 --> 00:15:28.139 align:start position:0%
do it all that way all the time but if
 
00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:29.220 align:start position:0%
you have some time you want to get
 
00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
started on the bills then they can come
 
00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:33.180 align:start position:0%
into the full division
 
00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:34.740 align:start position:0%
you might want to follow it up with
 
00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:36.720 align:start position:0%
anything and bring it up to the chair to
 
00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
say is everybody happy with what we've
 
00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:41.100 align:start position:0%
done did we learn anything new at the
 
00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:42.120 align:start position:0%
full thing because of somebody
 
00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:43.620 align:start position:0%
questioning something else that we
 
00:15:45.829 --> 00:15:45.839 align:start position:0%
didn't know and if that's the case he
 
00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:47.220 align:start position:0%
could have a follow-up session but
 
00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:49.320 align:start position:0%
otherwise whatever whatever the
 
00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:51.180 align:start position:0%
recommendation you did
 
00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
we'll have that at the final exec
 
00:15:56.750 --> 00:15:56.760 align:start position:0%
session but we'll see how it works out
 
00:15:58.970 --> 00:15:58.980 align:start position:0%
and I think I would be curious
 
00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:00.360 align:start position:0%
um certainly it's not up to the agencies
 
00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:01.980 align:start position:0%
but one of the things that I've found is
 
00:16:04.129 --> 00:16:04.139 align:start position:0%
that we have the present and again I
 
00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:06.120 align:start position:0%
have no problem taking bills early but
 
00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:07.500 align:start position:0%
we used to have the presentations over
 
00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:10.260 align:start position:0%
there which gave us information and
 
00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:11.820 align:start position:0%
knowledge and you could go home and
 
00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:13.260 align:start position:0%
spend some time and think about it you
 
00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:15.240 align:start position:0%
could look at the budget with their
 
00:16:17.389 --> 00:16:17.399 align:start position:0%
discussion in mind so when we come in
 
00:16:20.329 --> 00:16:20.339 align:start position:0%
here we were working already at a higher
 
00:16:23.329 --> 00:16:23.339 align:start position:0%
level than if it were a first Hearing in
 
00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
here does that make sense it says they
 
00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
informed our thinking and it gave us
 
00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:29.100 align:start position:0%
time to go through the budget and focus
 
00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
on specific things so it did impact our
 
00:16:34.009 --> 00:16:34.019 align:start position:0%
our conversation here I think gave us a
 
00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:35.820 align:start position:0%
higher level of discussion
 
00:16:38.569 --> 00:16:38.579 align:start position:0%
well see how it works out
 
00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:40.980 align:start position:0%
yes representative B
 
00:16:43.009 --> 00:16:43.019 align:start position:0%
it looks to me like if
 
00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:45.540 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to come twice if
 
00:16:47.749 --> 00:16:47.759 align:start position:0%
we do it this way
 
00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:50.100 align:start position:0%
they got to come here and then they got
 
00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:51.240 align:start position:0%
to go there
 
00:16:53.689 --> 00:16:53.699 align:start position:0%
if we just do it once instead of doing
 
00:16:56.110 --> 00:16:56.120 align:start position:0%
it twice seems to me to make more sense
 
00:16:59.749 --> 00:16:59.759 align:start position:0%
unless I'm confused
 
00:17:01.129 --> 00:17:01.139 align:start position:0%
well they may
 
00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:02.820 align:start position:0%
but this way here it's guaranteed
 
00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:04.079 align:start position:0%
they're going to come here first and
 
00:17:04.789 --> 00:17:04.799 align:start position:0%
then they're going to go there
 
00:17:04.799 --> 00:17:06.890 align:start position:0%
then they're going to go there
guaranteed

00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:06.900 align:start position:0%
guaranteed
 
00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:09.660 align:start position:0%
it's just just my opinion it's two two
 
00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:10.490 align:start position:0%
it's just just my opinion it's two two
here

00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:10.500 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:17:12.949 --> 00:17:12.959 align:start position:0%
they're gonna have two hearings
 
00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
I um
 
00:17:16.429 --> 00:17:16.439 align:start position:0%
I have a question you know we don't have
 
00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:19.160 align:start position:0%
the bills what are we going to work on
 
00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:21.720 align:start position:0%
right now I'm just talk I'm trying to
 
00:17:23.809 --> 00:17:23.819 align:start position:0%
determine if we're going to go down this
 
00:17:24.949 --> 00:17:24.959 align:start position:0%
new path
 
00:17:27.409 --> 00:17:27.419 align:start position:0%
how much time to a lot
 
00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:31.320 align:start position:0%
to the topics oh you guys have a better
 
00:17:33.289 --> 00:17:33.299 align:start position:0%
sense of these topics than I do that's
 
00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:34.860 align:start position:0%
what I'm asking
 
00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:36.289 align:start position:0%
what I'm asking
okay

00:17:36.289 --> 00:17:36.299 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:38.220 align:start position:0%
well let's go down the list and see how
 
00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
if we can figure out how long they might
 
00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:42.780 align:start position:0%
take I could really quickly thank you Mr
 
00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:43.909 align:start position:0%
take I could really quickly thank you Mr
chair

00:17:43.909 --> 00:17:43.919 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:46.140 align:start position:0%
I think
 
00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:48.360 align:start position:0%
I'm new here but everything I've heard
 
00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:49.860 align:start position:0%
is that we're gonna have a massive
 
00:17:51.409 --> 00:17:51.419 align:start position:0%
crunch later and that affects the
 
00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:53.700 align:start position:0%
quality of our discussions I would be
 
00:17:56.210 --> 00:17:56.220 align:start position:0%
very comfortable trying this new
 
00:17:58.190 --> 00:17:58.200 align:start position:0%
approach seeing whether you know it
 
00:17:59.930 --> 00:17:59.940 align:start position:0%
results in those types of delays or
 
00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:02.700 align:start position:0%
whether it helps us be more effective at
 
00:18:04.669 --> 00:18:04.679 align:start position:0%
our job and God knows if it doesn't work
 
00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:06.900 align:start position:0%
we can always change the process back
 
00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:09.240 align:start position:0%
but I think it behooves us to see
 
00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:10.980 align:start position:0%
whether this is a better way and again
 
00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:12.780 align:start position:0%
I'm the newest member here so I wouldn't
 
00:18:15.049 --> 00:18:15.059 align:start position:0%
know maybe that's why I'm more willing
 
00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:16.860 align:start position:0%
to try this and see how it goes thank
 
00:18:19.250 --> 00:18:19.260 align:start position:0%
you Ricky
 
00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm kind of just hearing this
 
00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:23.820 align:start position:0%
potential approach for the first time
 
00:18:25.909 --> 00:18:25.919 align:start position:0%
and um I guess the one thing that I
 
00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:27.960 align:start position:0%
would just give caution is if if we do
 
00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:29.400 align:start position:0%
hold work sessions especially on
 
00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
something like School building Aid on
 
00:18:33.289 --> 00:18:33.299 align:start position:0%
especially specific to those bills prior
 
00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
to the public hearing this room will be
 
00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:37.380 align:start position:0%
full of folks who are going to be
 
00:18:39.049 --> 00:18:39.059 align:start position:0%
probably looking to testify and I think
 
00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:40.500 align:start position:0%
that's going to put you Mr chair in a
 
00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:42.600 align:start position:0%
tough spot because work sessions really
 
00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
don't have a a guaranteed public input
 
00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:47.880 align:start position:0%
but you'd be in a spot where you'd have
 
00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:49.620 align:start position:0%
to say no you can't testify the hearings
 
00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:52.380 align:start position:0%
at a future time an alternative that
 
00:18:54.169 --> 00:18:54.179 align:start position:0%
would still help the division get ahead
 
00:18:56.450 --> 00:18:56.460 align:start position:0%
of its work especially on those School
 
00:18:57.529 --> 00:18:57.539 align:start position:0%
building it matters because those are
 
00:18:58.730 --> 00:18:58.740 align:start position:0%
going to be the most complicated of
 
00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
these initial bills is we could just
 
00:19:03.049 --> 00:19:03.059 align:start position:0%
invite the Department of Education Amy
 
00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:05.220 align:start position:0%
Clark their engineer for the school
 
00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:06.720 align:start position:0%
construction program to come in and just
 
00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:08.700 align:start position:0%
give a overview of the school building a
 
00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:11.640 align:start position:0%
program to division two that way when
 
00:19:13.789 --> 00:19:13.799 align:start position:0%
you do hear the bills you'll be more
 
00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
equipped to understand the program and
 
00:19:17.450 --> 00:19:17.460 align:start position:0%
and I think that'll expedite kind of
 
00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:19.020 align:start position:0%
dealing with those but you won't get
 
00:19:21.529 --> 00:19:21.539 align:start position:0%
into that public hearing out of order uh
 
00:19:24.770 --> 00:19:24.780 align:start position:0%
dilemma okay good thought could I add to
 
00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
that and say maybe we should have the
 
00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:29.400 align:start position:0%
department of Ed come in
 
00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:31.740 align:start position:0%
um in terms we have Caitlyn and and
 
00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
whoever and give an overview of what's
 
00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:36.780 align:start position:0%
going on at the department and Amy will
 
00:19:39.289 --> 00:19:39.299 align:start position:0%
give us what her part with the building
 
00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:41.640 align:start position:0%
Aid and I think that would give us a
 
00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
good start and give us a deeper
 
00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
understanding of the content that are in
 
00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:48.120 align:start position:0%
these bills and the impact that they
 
00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
will have on budget
 
00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:53.150 align:start position:0%
will have on budget
okay

00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:56.330 --> 00:19:56.340 align:start position:0%
it's a good compromise
 
00:19:57.890 --> 00:19:57.900 align:start position:0%
now that would still require public
 
00:19:57.900 --> 00:19:58.970 align:start position:0%
now that would still require public
notice

00:19:58.970 --> 00:19:58.980 align:start position:0%
notice
 
00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:00.720 align:start position:0%
it would it would be a public posted
 
00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:02.460 align:start position:0%
meeting for the Department of Education
 
00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:04.500 align:start position:0%
presentation essentially so the public
 
00:20:07.909 --> 00:20:07.919 align:start position:0%
would be able to uh monitor it listen to
 
00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:09.960 align:start position:0%
it stream it come here if they would
 
00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:11.820 align:start position:0%
like but it would just be a department
 
00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:13.980 align:start position:0%
presentation to the committee versus any
 
00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:19.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:20.940 align:start position:0%
three down
 
00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:23.340 align:start position:0%
four to go
 
00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:26.820 align:start position:0%
yes thank you in regards to the bill
 
00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:28.860 align:start position:0%
that we were asking about the 129
 
00:20:31.610 --> 00:20:31.620 align:start position:0%
providing menstrual hygiene products in
 
00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:33.900 align:start position:0%
schools the text of the bill requires
 
00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:35.820 align:start position:0%
that the Department of Education funds
 
00:20:37.669 --> 00:20:37.679 align:start position:0%
the cost and allows the school districts
 
00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
to receive funds for also providing this
 
00:20:42.529 --> 00:20:42.539 align:start position:0%
in previous years so that's the guess to
 
00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:46.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
I think those two other bills aren't
 
00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
going to be anywhere near the workload
 
00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:52.440 align:start position:0%
as the school building Aid would be I
 
00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:54.240 align:start position:0%
think you could almost do those in the
 
00:20:55.909 --> 00:20:55.919 align:start position:0%
traditional order of public hearing and
 
00:20:58.370 --> 00:20:58.380 align:start position:0%
then schedule a work session it's still
 
00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:00.360 align:start position:0%
up to you Mr chair if you wanted to have
 
00:21:02.090 --> 00:21:02.100 align:start position:0%
a work session prior but I still think
 
00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
you may have that same dilemma where you
 
00:21:04.669 --> 00:21:04.679 align:start position:0%
get a lot of folks that'll come into the
 
00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
work session thinking they can testify
 
00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:08.940 align:start position:0%
we could have a public hearing on 129.
 
00:21:10.549 --> 00:21:10.559 align:start position:0%
yeah and then go to a work session
 
00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
because it's not that big a deal I don't
 
00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
yeah I think 129 and and uh what's the
 
00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:17.400 align:start position:0%
other there's a couple of them here so
 
00:21:19.669 --> 00:21:19.679 align:start position:0%
four 468
 
00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
um I also don't think would would be
 
00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
much and then uh 550 no not 55.
 
00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:28.310 align:start position:0%
much and then uh 550 no not 55.
um

00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
207 sorry
 
00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:35.220 align:start position:0%
so 207 uh 129 and
 
00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
468 to me would be less of a workload
 
00:21:40.789 --> 00:21:40.799 align:start position:0%
than the three School building a bills
 
00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
for sure
 
00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
so if we were going to have a public
 
00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
hearing on those about how much time
 
00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:50.149 align:start position:0%
hearing on those about how much time
for

00:21:50.149 --> 00:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:55.200 align:start position:0%
uh for 207 and 468 I'd say 15 minutes
 
00:21:57.169 --> 00:21:57.179 align:start position:0%
between is probably sufficient possibly
 
00:21:59.390 --> 00:21:59.400 align:start position:0%
30 minutes for House Bill 129 I'm just
 
00:22:04.610 --> 00:22:04.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:07.610 --> 00:22:07.620 align:start position:0%
so if you did like a 10 10 15 and a 10
 
00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:08.750 align:start position:0%
so if you did like a 10 10 15 and a 10
30.

00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
30.
 
00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:09.890 align:start position:0%
30.
so

00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:09.900 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:14.940 align:start position:0%
468 207 and then a half hour for 129
 
00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:17.580 align:start position:0%
would probably be sufficient
 
00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:20.580 align:start position:0%
I mean we tried to re-qualify that pool
 
00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:22.620 align:start position:0%
what was the last one and that was six
 
00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:29.220 align:start position:0%
would be quite quite a chore
 
00:22:31.669 --> 00:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
so these are strictly public just the
 
00:22:34.549 --> 00:22:34.559 align:start position:0%
public hearing okay I got so many notes
 
00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:41.149 --> 00:22:41.159 align:start position:0%
207 yeah
 
00:22:43.909 --> 00:22:43.919 align:start position:0%
and 120 my my pins went out of beans
 
00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:46.260 align:start position:0%
okay at 10 30.
 
00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
no I got it thank you
 
00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
and chances are 129 and 468 will also
 
00:22:54.289 --> 00:22:54.299 align:start position:0%
become budget items because both would
 
00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
require if this division supported it
 
00:22:58.610 --> 00:22:58.620 align:start position:0%
adding something to the budget spending
 
00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
money to fund the hygiene products or to
 
00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:04.200 align:start position:0%
fund an attorney to recodify election so
 
00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:06.120 align:start position:0%
these bills would almost be disposed of
 
00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:07.500 align:start position:0%
and you're going to put it in House Bill
 
00:23:10.549 --> 00:23:10.559 align:start position:0%
too similar to school building a so uh
 
00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:13.080 align:start position:0%
the one 207 that's actually just a local
 
00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
impact that's not even a state impact
 
00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:16.980 align:start position:0%
you could if you're good with it which
 
00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:18.360 align:start position:0%
it looked like I think it was a pretty
 
00:23:21.169 --> 00:23:21.179 align:start position:0%
benign Bill unless we hear testimony to
 
00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:23.460 align:start position:0%
a different uh tune you could probably
 
00:23:26.149 --> 00:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
move that bill along real quick but the
 
00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
others again you can dispose of the
 
00:23:29.570 --> 00:23:29.580 align:start position:0%
bills real quick but the subject matter
 
00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:32.220 align:start position:0%
will be part of the budget talks later
 
00:23:33.890 --> 00:23:33.900 align:start position:0%
and I track all that for you I'll make
 
00:23:35.270 --> 00:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
sure that when we get into house bill
 
00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:37.020 align:start position:0%
one and two we consider these bills if
 
00:23:39.649 --> 00:23:39.659 align:start position:0%
you've retained them or whatever the
 
00:23:40.970 --> 00:23:40.980 align:start position:0%
decision was made
 
00:23:43.370 --> 00:23:43.380 align:start position:0%
so the department of Ed is going to give
 
00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
us a overview which would incorporate
 
00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:52.020 align:start position:0%
332 541 and 546.
 
00:23:56.210 --> 00:23:56.220 align:start position:0%
and then we have 468 207 129 starting at
 
00:23:58.430 --> 00:23:58.440 align:start position:0%
10 o'clock
 
00:24:00.529 --> 00:24:00.539 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
how long did the Department of Education
 
00:24:05.930 --> 00:24:05.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
depends on the topics if you stick to
 
00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:09.960 align:start position:0%
school building Aid I'd say
 
00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
I'd say I'd keep two hours hour hour to
 
00:24:14.149 --> 00:24:14.159 align:start position:0%
two possibly
 
00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:16.620 align:start position:0%
at least an hour
 
00:24:18.409 --> 00:24:18.419 align:start position:0%
were you looking to do this on the same
 
00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:20.460 align:start position:0%
day yes okay
 
00:24:21.890 --> 00:24:21.900 align:start position:0%
um the the public hearings keep in mind
 
00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:23.640 align:start position:0%
that would be a full committee
 
00:24:26.029 --> 00:24:26.039 align:start position:0%
thing so that's that's where it gets old
 
00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:28.740 align:start position:0%
doing division two scheduling versus the
 
00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
public hearings I think the requirements
 
00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:34.310 align:start position:0%
public hearings I think the requirements
yeah

00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:37.850 --> 00:24:37.860 align:start position:0%
so I think I think it's a a good idea to
 
00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
try to front load the bills but I I feel
 
00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:40.860 align:start position:0%
like it creates a little bit of
 
00:24:42.529 --> 00:24:42.539 align:start position:0%
complications to try to do division work
 
00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
prior to the public hearings okay
 
00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:50.409 align:start position:0%
prior to the public hearings okay
um

00:24:50.409 --> 00:24:50.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:52.500 align:start position:0%
and if some of you want to wait till
 
00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:54.240 align:start position:0%
that might just be within the next week
 
00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:56.450 align:start position:0%
that might just be within the next week
okay

00:24:56.450 --> 00:24:56.460 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:24:58.310 --> 00:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
well I've tried to push the Rope up the
 
00:25:01.570 --> 00:25:01.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:04.860 align:start position:0%
sure I'm gonna try to have a caucus for
 
00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:07.980 align:start position:0%
the Republicans down in 212. when you
 
00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:13.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:15.610 --> 00:25:15.620 align:start position:0%
expecting Jason Osborne
 
00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
okay he wants to come and clock us with
 
00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:20.340 align:start position:0%
the Republicans
 
00:25:23.149 --> 00:25:23.159 align:start position:0%
all right thank you thank you
 
00:25:23.159 --> 00:25:24.529 align:start position:0%
all right thank you thank you
yes

00:25:24.529 --> 00:25:24.539 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:25:25.789 --> 00:25:25.799 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
um as I recall it was I liked you know
 
00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
Mickey's idea and representative Heath
 
00:25:31.909 --> 00:25:31.919 align:start position:0%
to have people come in to give us an
 
00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:34.020 align:start position:0%
overview it really does help it gives
 
00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:35.940 align:start position:0%
you some context
 
00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:36.950 align:start position:0%
you some context
um

00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
it may not work with the day that you're
 
00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
scheduling here but it would be possible
 
00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:41.640 align:start position:0%
also to have Department of
 
00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:43.320 align:start position:0%
Transportation come in and give us that
 
00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:44.870 align:start position:0%
Transportation come in and give us that
pre

00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
pre
 
00:25:47.330 --> 00:25:47.340 align:start position:0%
um Bill kind of stuff just to get to lay
 
00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
of the land no real or lay of the road
 
00:25:52.490 --> 00:25:52.500 align:start position:0%
no pun intended exactly but a way of
 
00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
giving us an overview of the past year
 
00:25:56.330 --> 00:25:56.340 align:start position:0%
of Transportation where they want to go
 
00:25:58.370 --> 00:25:58.380 align:start position:0%
what they've been able to achieve it
 
00:26:00.049 --> 00:26:00.059 align:start position:0%
becomes more of a narrative in which it
 
00:26:02.930 --> 00:26:02.940 align:start position:0%
helps you to find context when we
 
00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:04.980 align:start position:0%
actually get the budget so if there were
 
00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:06.360 align:start position:0%
time or possibility to have
 
00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:08.100 align:start position:0%
transportation come in and give us that
 
00:26:10.190 --> 00:26:10.200 align:start position:0%
overview would be a help I think my
 
00:26:12.289 --> 00:26:12.299 align:start position:0%
first year on finance that happened for
 
00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:14.340 align:start position:0%
full financing
 
00:26:17.149 --> 00:26:17.159 align:start position:0%
Health and Human we did we had you know
 
00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:19.080 align:start position:0%
well they are meetings with Ways and
 
00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
Means um often that was joint with
 
00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
Finance but there was you know we were
 
00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:25.020 align:start position:0%
invited to the ways and means but then
 
00:26:27.289 --> 00:26:27.299 align:start position:0%
um we also had that just with finance
 
00:26:29.149 --> 00:26:29.159 align:start position:0%
and just within our division
 
00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
um and it's you know you have it's a
 
00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
smaller context and so you're better
 
00:26:34.789 --> 00:26:34.799 align:start position:0%
able to ask questions or Focus questions
 
00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:37.140 align:start position:0%
specific to your section of the budget
 
00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:40.200 align:start position:0%
so it was very helpful okay
 
00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:42.360 align:start position:0%
and you're right representative we have
 
00:26:44.330 --> 00:26:44.340 align:start position:0%
had full committee uh Department
 
00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
presentations before I'm not sure if
 
00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
that's the plan again uh it didn't sound
 
00:26:51.409 --> 00:26:51.419 align:start position:0%
like it no I didn't so I I certainly
 
00:26:53.149 --> 00:26:53.159 align:start position:0%
think there is value in having some
 
00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:55.080 align:start position:0%
agencies come in to just talk about kind
 
00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
of bigger picture stuff not diving into
 
00:26:57.830 --> 00:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
budgets yet because of course they're
 
00:26:59.029 --> 00:26:59.039 align:start position:0%
still working on their budget with the
 
00:27:00.830 --> 00:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
governor's office but at least kind of
 
00:27:02.570 --> 00:27:02.580 align:start position:0%
give you an agency overview talk about
 
00:27:04.490 --> 00:27:04.500 align:start position:0%
some of their major programs just so
 
00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
when you do get the budget it's familiar
 
00:27:07.669 --> 00:27:07.679 align:start position:0%
so if we have the Department of
 
00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
Education in at 10 o'clock
 
00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:12.120 align:start position:0%
invite them in at 10 o'clock next
 
00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:13.789 align:start position:0%
invite them in at 10 o'clock next
Tuesday

00:27:13.789 --> 00:27:13.799 align:start position:0%
Tuesday
 
00:27:13.799 --> 00:27:15.169 align:start position:0%
Tuesday
that

00:27:15.169 --> 00:27:15.179 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:17.220 align:start position:0%
and and I guess the question is do you
 
00:27:19.010 --> 00:27:19.020 align:start position:0%
want to just stick to uh just School
 
00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:20.400 align:start position:0%
building Aid because of course the
 
00:27:22.190 --> 00:27:22.200 align:start position:0%
Department of Education has you know
 
00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:24.120 align:start position:0%
adequate education I think so they could
 
00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:26.340 align:start position:0%
talk about any of the bills are coming
 
00:27:28.250 --> 00:27:28.260 align:start position:0%
before us as part of that presentation
 
00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:30.120 align:start position:0%
yeah Mary
 
00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:31.860 align:start position:0%
they may I really think it's important
 
00:27:34.010 --> 00:27:34.020 align:start position:0%
for them to do an overview of the school
 
00:27:36.529 --> 00:27:36.539 align:start position:0%
funding I think that's going to be
 
00:27:37.909 --> 00:27:37.919 align:start position:0%
something that we're going to need to
 
00:27:41.570 --> 00:27:41.580 align:start position:0%
focus on and inevitably that's building
 
00:27:44.029 --> 00:27:44.039 align:start position:0%
Aid is going to be part of that so I
 
00:27:46.730 --> 00:27:46.740 align:start position:0%
think if they could do that they did I
 
00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:49.500 align:start position:0%
couldn't make the demonstration they did
 
00:27:51.169 --> 00:27:51.179 align:start position:0%
for the presentation they did for
 
00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:54.120 align:start position:0%
education but here it was quite good
 
00:27:56.210 --> 00:27:56.220 align:start position:0%
um and I I think it would benefit all of
 
00:27:59.750 --> 00:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
us to hear that if it's possible I think
 
00:28:01.370 --> 00:28:01.380 align:start position:0%
you know we could do two hours in the
 
00:28:02.930 --> 00:28:02.940 align:start position:0%
morning two hours in the afternoon for
 
00:28:04.730 --> 00:28:04.740 align:start position:0%
essentially a full day of Department of
 
00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:06.360 align:start position:0%
Education just talking about their state
 
00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:08.400 align:start position:0%
aid programs is I think important so
 
00:28:10.190 --> 00:28:10.200 align:start position:0%
School building Aid adequate education
 
00:28:13.149 --> 00:28:13.159 align:start position:0%
grants special education Aid even efas
 
00:28:15.610 --> 00:28:15.620 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools you know all of those
 
00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:18.120 align:start position:0%
programs education trust fund programs
 
00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:19.740 align:start position:0%
essentially are important to this
 
00:28:21.169 --> 00:28:21.179 align:start position:0%
Division I think kind of getting that
 
00:28:23.630 --> 00:28:23.640 align:start position:0%
refresher for our attorney members in
 
00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
that crash course for our new members
 
00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
would be certainly valuable because I
 
00:28:28.370 --> 00:28:28.380 align:start position:0%
think there's some of those are in the
 
00:28:30.409 --> 00:28:30.419 align:start position:0%
policy committee right now
 
00:28:33.289 --> 00:28:33.299 align:start position:0%
yeah certainly so um there's a lot of
 
00:28:35.269 --> 00:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
bills that could be second referral to
 
00:28:38.090 --> 00:28:38.100 align:start position:0%
us on on a lot of these issues yeah
 
00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:41.880 align:start position:0%
yeah and if I can add perhaps you know
 
00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
three hours for Department of Education
 
00:28:45.529 --> 00:28:45.539 align:start position:0%
but then also had to have time for
 
00:28:48.289 --> 00:28:48.299 align:start position:0%
higher education to come in
 
00:28:49.970 --> 00:28:49.980 align:start position:0%
um you know our community colleges the
 
00:28:52.610 --> 00:28:52.620 align:start position:0%
university system the technical schools
 
00:28:54.769 --> 00:28:54.779 align:start position:0%
and get you know even then you've got
 
00:28:56.450 --> 00:28:56.460 align:start position:0%
three of them so if you get 20-minute
 
00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
overview of something from the higher
 
00:29:02.149 --> 00:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:02.159 --> 00:29:13.130 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:29:13.130 --> 00:29:13.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:14.940 align:start position:0%
can I just ask a question about
 
00:29:18.289 --> 00:29:18.299 align:start position:0%
clarifying what um departments we are
 
00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
going to cover in division two
 
00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:23.340 align:start position:0%
um during the last session we picked up
 
00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:25.490 align:start position:0%
um during the last session we picked up
Des

00:29:25.490 --> 00:29:25.500 align:start position:0%
Des
 
00:29:26.930 --> 00:29:26.940 align:start position:0%
um and I think it was because we had
 
00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:29.640 align:start position:0%
done our work in um the chair of Finance
 
00:29:32.990 --> 00:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
was our chair so we just kind of took up
 
00:29:34.850 --> 00:29:34.860 align:start position:0%
what she had to get done right are we
 
00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:38.520 align:start position:0%
going to continue no no we'll be go back
 
00:29:40.130 --> 00:29:40.140 align:start position:0%
to one yeah so we're going to be back to
 
00:29:42.049 --> 00:29:42.059 align:start position:0%
the traditional agency assignments yeah
 
00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
uh so last term there was some change in
 
00:29:47.450 --> 00:29:47.460 align:start position:0%
some leadership and division members got
 
00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
moved around a little bit so a couple of
 
00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
the agencies slid over just to kind of
 
00:29:53.810 --> 00:29:53.820 align:start position:0%
uh spread the workload if you will but
 
00:29:55.610 --> 00:29:55.620 align:start position:0%
um we're resetting this here was the
 
00:29:57.049 --> 00:29:57.059 align:start position:0%
plan representative Weiler confirmed
 
00:29:58.909 --> 00:29:58.919 align:start position:0%
that so okay we're back to our normal
 
00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
Aid agencies which
 
00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
um I do have that before you
 
00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:04.430 align:start position:0%
um I do have that before you
um

00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:04.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:07.080 align:start position:0%
so if you that first page that I sent
 
00:30:10.130 --> 00:30:10.140 align:start position:0%
you or handed out there you see on the
 
00:30:11.690 --> 00:30:11.700 align:start position:0%
third column over you see my name at the
 
00:30:13.669 --> 00:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
header so those are our agencies that
 
00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
we're responsible for their budgets and
 
00:30:17.389 --> 00:30:17.399 align:start position:0%
subject matter on bills anything that
 
00:30:18.769 --> 00:30:18.779 align:start position:0%
comes through Finance would be referred
 
00:30:18.779 --> 00:30:27.889 align:start position:0%
comes through Finance would be referred
here

00:30:27.889 --> 00:30:27.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:27.899 --> 00:30:29.149 align:start position:0%
 
well

00:30:29.149 --> 00:30:29.159 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:30:30.529 --> 00:30:30.539 align:start position:0%
then I guess we're down to the
 
00:30:32.570 --> 00:30:32.580 align:start position:0%
Department of Education
 
00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
in some form filling up a day
 
00:30:37.970 --> 00:30:37.980 align:start position:0%
yeah I think certainly uh just just if
 
00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:39.720 align:start position:0%
nothing else just talking about their
 
00:30:42.130 --> 00:30:42.140 align:start position:0%
state aid programs could fill a day
 
00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
having higher education come in uh
 
00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
invite CSS ccsnh and usnh would be
 
00:30:50.090 --> 00:30:50.100 align:start position:0%
valuable uh and certainly the Department
 
00:30:52.789 --> 00:30:52.799 align:start position:0%
of Transportation Department of Safety
 
00:30:55.370 --> 00:30:55.380 align:start position:0%
has quite a bit too a lot of theirs does
 
00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:56.029 align:start position:0%
has quite a bit too a lot of theirs does
um

00:30:56.029 --> 00:30:56.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:57.470 --> 00:30:57.480 align:start position:0%
fall in line well with the operating
 
00:30:58.970 --> 00:30:58.980 align:start position:0%
budget presentations we'll hear when
 
00:31:00.649 --> 00:31:00.659 align:start position:0%
that happens if there's anything
 
00:31:02.450 --> 00:31:02.460 align:start position:0%
specific that any of the members can
 
00:31:04.970 --> 00:31:04.980 align:start position:0%
think of that's worthwhile to invite the
 
00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
department of safety and we could but I
 
00:31:09.230 --> 00:31:09.240 align:start position:0%
kind of feel like doe and Dot are
 
00:31:10.909 --> 00:31:10.919 align:start position:0%
probably our biggest hitters to kind of
 
00:31:13.070 --> 00:31:13.080 align:start position:0%
get a head start on on what they've got
 
00:31:14.149 --> 00:31:14.159 align:start position:0%
going on
 
00:31:16.370 --> 00:31:16.380 align:start position:0%
well if we can pull this off for next
 
00:31:19.190 --> 00:31:19.200 align:start position:0%
Tuesday is that agreeable
 
00:31:21.470 --> 00:31:21.480 align:start position:0%
because that frees us up in what might
 
00:31:27.130 --> 00:31:27.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:35.690 --> 00:31:35.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean so reminder we don't have
 
00:31:40.250 --> 00:31:40.260 align:start position:0%
we don't have the budget yet so they're
 
00:31:41.810 --> 00:31:41.820 align:start position:0%
still working on their budget so it's
 
00:31:43.610 --> 00:31:43.620 align:start position:0%
really just subject matter presentations
 
00:31:46.669 --> 00:31:46.679 align:start position:0%
and I'm not I think if you did a doe
 
00:31:48.169 --> 00:31:48.179 align:start position:0%
presentation on one day and then another
 
00:31:50.269 --> 00:31:50.279 align:start position:0%
day half D.O.T half higher ed right
 
00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
you'd be pretty good I think that's a
 
00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
pretty good uh good effort and if we
 
00:31:56.750 --> 00:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
still would have two weeks in between if
 
00:31:58.610 --> 00:31:58.620 align:start position:0%
you feel um because we will have Bill
 
00:32:00.409 --> 00:32:00.419 align:start position:0%
work I assume sometime in those two
 
00:32:01.970 --> 00:32:01.980 align:start position:0%
weeks we'll have the bills heard and
 
00:32:03.289 --> 00:32:03.299 align:start position:0%
we'll can have our work sessions in here
 
00:32:05.930 --> 00:32:05.940 align:start position:0%
but if we did want to do other uh invite
 
00:32:07.850 --> 00:32:07.860 align:start position:0%
other agencies in we certainly could do
 
00:32:09.649 --> 00:32:09.659 align:start position:0%
that too but I think scheduling Tuesday
 
00:32:12.289 --> 00:32:12.299 align:start position:0%
Wednesday doe Dot and higher ed is a
 
00:32:15.230 --> 00:32:15.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:16.730 align:start position:0%
 
dude

00:32:16.730 --> 00:32:16.740 align:start position:0%
dude
 
00:32:20.149 --> 00:32:20.159 align:start position:0%
I thought safety was one of those
 
00:32:24.289 --> 00:32:24.299 align:start position:0%
they are and we could um I feel like uh
 
00:32:26.330 --> 00:32:26.340 align:start position:0%
a whole day of D.O.T and safety is
 
00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
probably too much but a morning of just
 
00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
Dot and safety is probably not enough if
 
00:32:31.730 --> 00:32:31.740 align:start position:0%
that makes sense like it's not like I
 
00:32:33.230 --> 00:32:33.240 align:start position:0%
think two hours for both of them is
 
00:32:35.510 --> 00:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
probably uh uh pinching them a little
 
00:32:36.769 --> 00:32:36.779 align:start position:0%
bit on time
 
00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
um we could maybe do Dot
 
00:32:42.529 --> 00:32:42.539 align:start position:0%
uh in the morning and then split safety
 
00:32:44.930 --> 00:32:44.940 align:start position:0%
and higher ed in the afternoon perhaps
 
00:32:46.850 --> 00:32:46.860 align:start position:0%
um do you know do like a one to four
 
00:32:49.010 --> 00:32:49.020 align:start position:0%
afternoon perhaps and I think that could
 
00:32:49.020 --> 00:32:50.269 align:start position:0%
afternoon perhaps and I think that could
maybe

00:32:50.269 --> 00:32:50.279 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
00:32:52.610 --> 00:32:52.620 align:start position:0%
you know do like an hour for uh
 
00:32:55.610 --> 00:32:55.620 align:start position:0%
safety an hour for ccsnh an hour for us
 
00:32:59.690 --> 00:32:59.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:04.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:07.260 align:start position:0%
on Tuesday we'll be the department of Ed
 
00:33:10.130 --> 00:33:10.140 align:start position:0%
yeah 10 to 12 and then one to four
 
00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:18.120 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman are you looking at the 24th
 
00:33:19.549 --> 00:33:19.559 align:start position:0%
and the 25th is that what you're looking
 
00:33:22.909 --> 00:33:22.919 align:start position:0%
at yes yeah next Tuesday Wednesday okay
 
00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:25.140 align:start position:0%
and of course
 
00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:27.480 align:start position:0%
um all best plans you know if the
 
00:33:29.450 --> 00:33:29.460 align:start position:0%
agencies are available you know we're
 
00:33:31.490 --> 00:33:31.500 align:start position:0%
not sure well to connect with them to
 
00:33:32.990 --> 00:33:33.000 align:start position:0%
see if they can set aside the time for
 
00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:33.830 align:start position:0%
see if they can set aside the time for
us

00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:33:35.870 --> 00:33:35.880 align:start position:0%
you'll do that
 
00:33:38.149 --> 00:33:38.159 align:start position:0%
generally Janet does the scheduling but
 
00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:39.960 align:start position:0%
I can you know just make sure she knows
 
00:33:45.169 --> 00:33:45.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:47.090 --> 00:33:47.100 align:start position:0%
well I don't know I'm just lucky I got
 
00:33:49.610 --> 00:33:49.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:06.490 --> 00:34:06.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:14.149 --> 00:34:14.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
Mickey is that what you've got
 
00:34:19.010 --> 00:34:19.020 align:start position:0%
I think if I think if we did uh on the
 
00:34:22.490 --> 00:34:22.500 align:start position:0%
25th 10 o'clock dot one o'clock safety
 
00:34:26.089 --> 00:34:26.099 align:start position:0%
uh and then two o'clock CCS three
 
00:34:27.889 --> 00:34:27.899 align:start position:0%
o'clock usnh or something like that
 
00:34:31.669 --> 00:34:31.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
so you'll coordinate that with Janet
 
00:34:36.470 --> 00:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
yeah I'll connect with Janet and see if
 
00:34:38.210 --> 00:34:38.220 align:start position:0%
we can invite the folks see if they're
 
00:34:41.570 --> 00:34:41.580 align:start position:0%
available and adjust if we need to okay
 
00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:42.909 align:start position:0%
available and adjust if we need to okay
but

00:34:42.909 --> 00:34:42.919 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
this is just content overview it's not
 
00:34:48.470 --> 00:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
budget discussion just yeah I mean they
 
00:34:50.450 --> 00:34:50.460 align:start position:0%
can speak to I don't even think you want
 
00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:52.200 align:start position:0%
to get too deep into their agency
 
00:34:53.930 --> 00:34:53.940 align:start position:0%
budgets even I think just hearing about
 
00:34:56.270 --> 00:34:56.280 align:start position:0%
you know who they are what they do
 
00:34:58.190 --> 00:34:58.200 align:start position:0%
um that's that would be valuable for the
 
00:34:59.750 --> 00:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
committee just to get some of that
 
00:35:01.130 --> 00:35:01.140 align:start position:0%
knowledge down before you start getting
 
00:35:05.570 --> 00:35:05.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:07.730 --> 00:35:07.740 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:09.720 align:start position:0%
you never know where you end up and then
 
00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
hopefully uh sometime you know we'll
 
00:35:13.250 --> 00:35:13.260 align:start position:0%
maybe I'll connect back with
 
00:35:14.930 --> 00:35:14.940 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler or Janet or just
 
00:35:16.069 --> 00:35:16.079 align:start position:0%
see what their plan is for full
 
00:35:17.210 --> 00:35:17.220 align:start position:0%
committee work sessions because the
 
00:35:18.770 --> 00:35:18.780 align:start position:0%
other divisions I would expect are gonna
 
00:35:21.050 --> 00:35:21.060 align:start position:0%
want to start working on bills and work
 
00:35:23.270 --> 00:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
sessions and you know traditionally we
 
00:35:24.650 --> 00:35:24.660 align:start position:0%
have the public hearings first I think
 
00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
that would create a little bit of chaos
 
00:35:28.130 --> 00:35:28.140 align:start position:0%
if we did it out of order okay
 
00:35:30.109 --> 00:35:30.119 align:start position:0%
um but hopefully if they can't make the
 
00:35:32.089 --> 00:35:32.099 align:start position:0%
calendar for this week to schedule the
 
00:35:34.250 --> 00:35:34.260 align:start position:0%
hearings or
 
00:35:35.569 --> 00:35:35.579 align:start position:0%
that's the other thing too we just need
 
00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:36.720 align:start position:0%
to make sure representative Wilder is
 
00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:38.040 align:start position:0%
not scheduling public hearings on the
 
00:35:40.250 --> 00:35:40.260 align:start position:0%
24th and 25th right now as we're in here
 
00:35:41.810 --> 00:35:41.820 align:start position:0%
but I don't even sound like it didn't
 
00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
sound like it so at some point those
 
00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:45.240 align:start position:0%
will be scheduled and then we can have
 
00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
our work sessions on those six bills you
 
00:35:49.609 --> 00:35:49.619 align:start position:0%
know possibly the week of the 30th
 
00:35:52.609 --> 00:35:52.619 align:start position:0%
traditionally uh this committee how many
 
00:35:56.210 --> 00:35:56.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:59.750 --> 00:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
a lot yeah it varies on the you know how
 
00:36:02.210 --> 00:36:02.220 align:start position:0%
we feel about the budget and it varies
 
00:36:04.370 --> 00:36:04.380 align:start position:0%
on not just these bills but when second
 
00:36:06.170 --> 00:36:06.180 align:start position:0%
committee bills start coming in it's
 
00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
impossible I think to predict
 
00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
oh generally I think the work sessions
 
00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:14.640 align:start position:0%
though are pretty functional and to the
 
00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
point we don't drag things out very much
 
00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
and a lot of things will just get
 
00:36:20.810 --> 00:36:20.820 align:start position:0%
retained so it's like oh we'll deal with
 
00:36:22.370 --> 00:36:22.380 align:start position:0%
that after we get the budget right
 
00:36:23.569 --> 00:36:23.579 align:start position:0%
because a lot of them are heading for
 
00:36:35.950 --> 00:36:35.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:39.490 --> 00:36:39.500 align:start position:0%
correct right away
 
00:36:42.349 --> 00:36:42.359 align:start position:0%
it is a lot of first referral bills for
 
00:36:42.359 --> 00:36:43.250 align:start position:0%
it is a lot of first referral bills for
sure

00:36:43.250 --> 00:36:43.260 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:36:45.589 --> 00:36:45.599 align:start position:0%
um but like we said we have the time to
 
00:36:48.109 --> 00:36:48.119 align:start position:0%
do it before February 15th so
 
00:36:50.089 --> 00:36:50.099 align:start position:0%
um I think we'll be we'll be okay and
 
00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
and five out of the six of them will end
 
00:36:54.170 --> 00:36:54.180 align:start position:0%
up in House Bill 2 anyways if the
 
00:36:59.030 --> 00:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:00.349 align:start position:0%
 
oh

00:37:00.349 --> 00:37:00.359 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:37:03.770 --> 00:37:03.780 align:start position:0%
exciting start well I I just mentioned
 
00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
that it now that I'm trying to get a
 
00:37:08.450 --> 00:37:08.460 align:start position:0%
little more of an overview of what you
 
00:37:10.069 --> 00:37:10.079 align:start position:0%
what you were doing here what you were
 
00:37:11.930 --> 00:37:11.940 align:start position:0%
trying to do was
 
00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
traditionally we have come in and had
 
00:37:16.430 --> 00:37:16.440 align:start position:0%
the Departments come in and give us an
 
00:37:19.730 --> 00:37:19.740 align:start position:0%
overview before before we even looked at
 
00:37:22.150 --> 00:37:22.160 align:start position:0%
any bills right so doing that is
 
00:37:24.710 --> 00:37:24.720 align:start position:0%
actually falling back to what what's
 
00:37:32.569 --> 00:37:32.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:33.950 --> 00:37:33.960 align:start position:0%
the last term
 
00:37:36.770 --> 00:37:36.780 align:start position:0%
well I don't think we did it last term
 
00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
well we did it in here I mean you might
 
00:37:40.670 --> 00:37:40.680 align:start position:0%
have but I'm talking full financed
 
00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
because we have yeah we were on Zoom
 
00:37:45.589 --> 00:37:45.599 align:start position:0%
last time during this phase so it was it
 
00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
was definitely uh that's why I can't
 
00:37:49.010 --> 00:37:49.020 align:start position:0%
remember it was business not as usual
 
00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:50.210 align:start position:0%
remember it was business not as usual
but

00:37:50.210 --> 00:37:50.220 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:37:53.290 --> 00:37:53.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:56.450 --> 00:37:56.460 align:start position:0%
he's probably doing laundry yeah oh man
 
00:37:58.550 --> 00:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
I'm getting good at that
 
00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:00.410 align:start position:0%
I'm getting good at that
okay

00:38:00.410 --> 00:38:00.420 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
so we're comfortable whoever where we
 
00:38:04.970 --> 00:38:04.980 align:start position:0%
are right now
 
00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:05.930 align:start position:0%
are right now
um

00:38:05.930 --> 00:38:05.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:07.849 --> 00:38:07.859 align:start position:0%
and I would appreciate it if y'all if
 
00:38:10.069 --> 00:38:10.079 align:start position:0%
you have a card if you or a piece of
 
00:38:11.930 --> 00:38:11.940 align:start position:0%
paper just give me your your phone
 
00:38:15.170 --> 00:38:15.180 align:start position:0%
number and your email address to Tom
 
00:38:18.310 --> 00:38:18.320 align:start position:0%
the one you really use not the one
 
00:38:20.690 --> 00:38:20.700 align:start position:0%
I don't use the government email address
 
00:38:24.530 --> 00:38:24.540 align:start position:0%
so I'm one of those
 
00:38:28.970 --> 00:38:28.980 align:start position:0%
and you're one two well no I I use the
 
00:38:31.010 --> 00:38:31.020 align:start position:0%
legislative email address that that I
 
00:38:33.710 --> 00:38:33.720 align:start position:0%
have here fine I I'm just saying I just
 
00:38:35.810 --> 00:38:35.820 align:start position:0%
want to be able if something comes up I
 
00:38:37.550 --> 00:38:37.560 align:start position:0%
want to I hope I did that's what's on
 
00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:42.890 --> 00:38:42.900 align:start position:0%
which I'm using yeah that's my candidate
 
00:38:44.750 --> 00:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
card it was before I had a legislative
 
00:38:46.490 --> 00:38:46.500 align:start position:0%
would you want me to use the legislative
 
00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
one uh I would probably prefer that you
 
00:38:51.230 --> 00:38:51.240 align:start position:0%
use the legislative address for
 
00:38:52.849 --> 00:38:52.859 align:start position:0%
committee business just to keep things
 
00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
separate but that's my cell phone number
 
00:38:57.710 --> 00:38:57.720 align:start position:0%
and also okay thank you and by the way
 
00:39:00.050 --> 00:39:00.060 align:start position:0%
my legislative address is DPM you don't
 
00:39:01.910 --> 00:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
have to type the full number they gave
 
00:39:06.290 --> 00:39:06.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:08.750 --> 00:39:08.760 align:start position:0%
and I'll screw that one up
 
00:39:11.870 --> 00:39:11.880 align:start position:0%
and representative Heath before I reach
 
00:39:13.250 --> 00:39:13.260 align:start position:0%
out to anybody I would get in touch with
 
00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:16.030 align:start position:0%
out to anybody I would get in touch with
you

00:39:16.030 --> 00:39:16.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:18.890 --> 00:39:18.900 align:start position:0%
my regular emails on the back I use them
 
00:39:20.870 --> 00:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
both because I'm terrified I'm going to
 
00:39:23.890 --> 00:39:23.900 align:start position:0%
miss any now uh but
 
00:39:26.990 --> 00:39:27.000 align:start position:0%

00:39:44.270 --> 00:39:44.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
all right you haven't got one
 
00:39:49.790 --> 00:39:49.800 align:start position:0%
you're working on it Well mine's easy
 
00:39:55.069 --> 00:39:55.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:57.770 --> 00:39:57.780 align:start position:0%
I don't use I don't use well legislate
 
00:40:01.390 --> 00:40:01.400 align:start position:0%
legislate one forwards on
 
00:40:05.650 --> 00:40:05.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:08.750 --> 00:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
and if you if you really want to get
 
00:40:17.470 --> 00:40:17.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:19.970 --> 00:40:19.980 align:start position:0%
my number is
 
00:40:19.980 --> 00:40:24.430 align:start position:0%
my number is
603

00:40:24.430 --> 00:40:24.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:28.510 align:start position:0%
 
-793-9055.

00:40:28.510 --> 00:40:28.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:31.609 --> 00:40:31.619 align:start position:0%
that works for me a piece of paper is
 
00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:39.770 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:40:39.770 --> 00:40:39.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:44.089 --> 00:40:44.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:47.870 --> 00:40:47.880 align:start position:0%
well the reason I explained that at
 
00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
yourpreter.com because I don't get very
 
00:40:53.450 --> 00:40:53.460 align:start position:0%
many in there uh hopes I get a lot you
 
00:40:55.550 --> 00:40:55.560 align:start position:0%
know because it's it falls through this
 
00:40:55.560 --> 00:40:57.050 align:start position:0%
know because it's it falls through this
legislative

00:40:57.050 --> 00:40:57.060 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
00:40:58.609 --> 00:40:58.619 align:start position:0%
because they're all subject to freaking
 
00:41:03.290 --> 00:41:03.300 align:start position:0%
918. great yeah no reply
 
00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:10.910 align:start position:0%
918. great yeah no reply
right

00:41:10.910 --> 00:41:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
if it you know you'll hear the the
 
00:41:14.930 --> 00:41:14.940 align:start position:0%
reason for it from the sponsor of the
 
00:41:16.609 --> 00:41:16.619 align:start position:0%
public hearing it's certainly something
 
00:41:19.310 --> 00:41:19.320 align:start position:0%
that uh on its face doesn't look like
 
00:41:21.230 --> 00:41:21.240 align:start position:0%
it's a big change and it's not something
 
00:41:22.849 --> 00:41:22.859 align:start position:0%
that's really a charge of
 
00:41:26.450 --> 00:41:26.460 align:start position:0%
Finance is not a state related impact so
 
00:41:29.270 --> 00:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
right and and we're talking about 207
 
00:41:32.030 --> 00:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
it's almost like most municipalities do
 
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:34.020 align:start position:0%
that anyway
 
00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
to accept they have to accept the money
 
00:41:39.890 --> 00:41:39.900 align:start position:0%
funds to raise their spending levels and
 
00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
I think I think it goes a threshold of
 
00:41:44.089 --> 00:41:44.099 align:start position:0%
five thousand to twenty thousand so it
 
00:41:44.099 --> 00:41:44.870 align:start position:0%
five thousand to twenty thousand so it
wasn't

00:41:44.870 --> 00:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
wasn't
 
00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
you know some smaller districts that's a
 
00:41:48.170 --> 00:41:48.180 align:start position:0%
big amount of money but
 
00:41:50.329 --> 00:41:50.339 align:start position:0%
but we'll we'll hear about it
 
00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
can I um just double check we don't need
 
00:41:55.010 --> 00:41:55.020 align:start position:0%
public notice or we don't need any
 
00:41:57.770 --> 00:41:57.780 align:start position:0%
noticing to have agencies come in and
 
00:42:00.290 --> 00:42:00.300 align:start position:0%
talk to us we can just do that without
 
00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
any prior they'll be scheduled they'll
 
00:42:03.589 --> 00:42:03.599 align:start position:0%
be in the calendar but it doesn't have
 
00:42:06.410 --> 00:42:06.420 align:start position:0%
to be a public notice uh it'll be public
 
00:42:08.270 --> 00:42:08.280 align:start position:0%
or public notified in the house calendar
 
00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
it won't be up okay is there time to do
 
00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
that for next week I'm going to check
 
00:42:14.089 --> 00:42:14.099 align:start position:0%
with Jan I think we can if we get it in
 
00:42:17.089 --> 00:42:17.099 align:start position:0%
today Thursday at 5. Wednesday at five
 
00:42:19.730 --> 00:42:19.740 align:start position:0%
yeah I think today you get in the
 
00:42:21.470 --> 00:42:21.480 align:start position:0%
calendar today to file okay so they do
 
00:42:24.050 --> 00:42:24.060 align:start position:0%
have to be noticed somehow okay it's uh
 
00:42:25.490 --> 00:42:25.500 align:start position:0%
I'll just have to hustle to make sure
 
00:42:27.170 --> 00:42:27.180 align:start position:0%
the agencies can commit to that too
 
00:42:29.270 --> 00:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
prior to the posting deadline but we
 
00:42:31.250 --> 00:42:31.260 align:start position:0%
should be okay
 
00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:32.569 align:start position:0%
should be okay
oh

00:42:32.569 --> 00:42:32.579 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:39.589 --> 00:42:39.599 align:start position:0%
and this is a an aside one of the things
 
00:42:41.870 --> 00:42:41.880 align:start position:0%
that came up during that whole covert
 
00:42:45.829 --> 00:42:45.839 align:start position:0%
thing a 91a issue was is you can't if
 
00:42:47.690 --> 00:42:47.700 align:start position:0%
