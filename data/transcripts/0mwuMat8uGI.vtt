landf up in the Connecticut River uh HB
 
00:06:42.309 --> 00:06:42.319 align:start position:0%
563 which I'm introducing is a bill
 
00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:44.800 align:start position:0%
that's relative to the education grant
 
00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:46.680 align:start position:0%
amounts for pupes receiving special
 
00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:47.950 align:start position:0%
amounts for pupes receiving special
education

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:47.960 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:51.080 align:start position:0%
services and if you have a copy of the
 
00:06:54.029 --> 00:06:54.039 align:start position:0%
bill the components of this bill are
 
00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:56.440 align:start position:0%
that are that I'm introducing are
 
00:06:58.710 --> 00:06:58.720 align:start position:0%
highlighted what I want to mention is
 
00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:00.560 align:start position:0%
that this
 
00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:03.280 align:start position:0%
there are three primary or a number of
 
00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:05.120 align:start position:0%
real priorities which we have as an
 
00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:08.800 align:start position:0%
education funding committee fixing the
 
00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
adequacy budget looking at special
 
00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:15.440 align:start position:0%
education costs and looking at things
 
00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:17.960 align:start position:0%
such as cat Aid and the components are
 
00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:21.440 align:start position:0%
which are within this and be looking at
 
00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
other areas such as building Aid and and
 
00:07:26.309 --> 00:07:26.319 align:start position:0%
and Career Technical education and and
 
00:07:29.189 --> 00:07:29.199 align:start position:0%
Higher Education costs in this bill
 
00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:31.800 align:start position:0%
right here here there are several
 
00:07:33.749 --> 00:07:33.759 align:start position:0%
changes and what I'd like to do is just
 
00:07:35.909 --> 00:07:35.919 align:start position:0%
look at those changes and say why is
 
00:07:35.919 --> 00:07:37.150 align:start position:0%
look at those changes and say why is
that

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:37.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:40.280 align:start position:0%
occurring the first portion is that
 
00:07:42.749 --> 00:07:42.759 align:start position:0%
where we've reflecting in there a cost
 
00:07:45.869 --> 00:07:45.879 align:start position:0%
of 4266 as our base
 
00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:48.800 align:start position:0%
cost that is exactly what's projected
 
00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:51.240 align:start position:0%
based off of last year with a 2%
 
00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:54.360 align:start position:0%
increase it comes out to $
 
00:07:57.790 --> 00:07:57.800 align:start position:0%
4,265 and some odd sense that's I I've
 
00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:01.280 align:start position:0%
rounded it off in on on this bill
 
00:08:04.629 --> 00:08:04.639 align:start position:0%
and within that bill we've looked at
 
00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
various inputs which contribute to that
 
00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:08.350 align:start position:0%
various inputs which contribute to that
$

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:08.360 align:start position:0%
$
 
00:08:11.629 --> 00:08:11.639 align:start position:0%
4,266 per pupil
 
00:08:15.749 --> 00:08:15.759 align:start position:0%
and and parallel what that cost is with
 
00:08:15.759 --> 00:08:16.670 align:start position:0%
and and parallel what that cost is with
those

00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:16.680 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
components and and also allocated or
 
00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:23.240 align:start position:0%
identified component costs associated
 
00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:26.680 align:start position:0%
with that and those costs and those
 
00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:30.120 align:start position:0%
items which that 4266 looks at are the
 
00:08:32.469 --> 00:08:32.479 align:start position:0%
same components which were put in our
 
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
initial legislation when it came out of
 
00:08:38.149 --> 00:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
the esbrook study back in 2000 November
 
00:08:41.469 --> 00:08:41.479 align:start position:0%
2008 going on down uh there's additional
 
00:08:44.949 --> 00:08:44.959 align:start position:0%
cost for differentiated Aid the amount
 
00:08:48.269 --> 00:08:48.279 align:start position:0%
that's stated there of 2393 is what is
 
00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:51.800 align:start position:0%
also projected in the budget right now
 
00:08:54.949 --> 00:08:54.959 align:start position:0%
that will coming forward with the uh 2%
 
00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:56.200 align:start position:0%
for FY
 
00:09:00.509 --> 00:09:00.519 align:start position:0%
26 it's based off of um uh what we have
 
00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:02.440 align:start position:0%
had in the past and it just moves
 
00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:06.120 align:start position:0%
forward in that way the and that those
 
00:09:09.269 --> 00:09:09.279 align:start position:0%
that item is for for free and reduce
 
00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:13.880 align:start position:0%
meals the uh item C in line 10 of that
 
00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
$832 is is the same you know it's been
 
00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:19.240 align:start position:0%
increased by the amount that's for FY 26
 
00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
for English language Learners those are
 
00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
two areas that differentiated Aid the
 
00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:27.160 align:start position:0%
third area of differentiated Aid
 
00:09:30.269 --> 00:09:30.279 align:start position:0%
addresses how we look at special
 
00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:32.680 align:start position:0%
education and fund that within the
 
00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
adequacy formula itself there's other
 
00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:37.160 align:start position:0%
ways of funding this through the
 
00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
catastrophic Aid this does not deal with
 
00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
that and we know that there's issues
 
00:09:43.829 --> 00:09:43.839 align:start position:0%
with that with the
 
00:09:43.839 --> 00:09:45.389 align:start position:0%
with that with the
17

00:09:45.389 --> 00:09:45.399 align:start position:0%
17
 
00:09:48.829 --> 00:09:48.839 align:start position:0%
millionar uh shortfall that we have and
 
00:09:50.829 --> 00:09:50.839 align:start position:0%
having we're having how we're prorating
 
00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:54.440 align:start position:0%
that down to the 67 67% we're aware of
 
00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:56.920 align:start position:0%
that and that this issue will be
 
00:09:59.750 --> 00:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
addressed not through this bill though
 
00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
however we do know that every time we
 
00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
increase something on the leftand side
 
00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
of that formula by $100 4200 to 4300
 
00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:12.240 align:start position:0%
4,300 to 4,400 we are jumping our budget
 
00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:14.680 align:start position:0%
by about100
 
00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
million that is going to be very hard to
 
00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:19.200 align:start position:0%
to sustain however we have a
 
00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
responsibility a constitutional
 
00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:23.640 align:start position:0%
responsibility to ensure that we're
 
00:10:24.829 --> 00:10:24.839 align:start position:0%
providing the opportunity for an
 
00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:26.920 align:start position:0%
adequate education for all
 
00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:29.320 align:start position:0%
students in looking at the special
 
00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:31.120 align:start position:0%
education component of differentiated
 
00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:33.800 align:start position:0%
Aid there are three categories these are
 
00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
the same three categories that are
 
00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:39.370 align:start position:0%
reported to the federal government under
 
00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:40.590 align:start position:0%
reported to the federal government under
[Music]

00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:40.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:44.200 align:start position:0%
Ida category a is a category which it
 
00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:47.560 align:start position:0%
deals with if you're in this in the uh
 
00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:50.440 align:start position:0%
in the classroom for at least 80% of the
 
00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:53.880 align:start position:0%
day category b as with anep and there
 
00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
are 13 classifications of IEPs this is
 
00:11:00.269 --> 00:11:00.279 align:start position:0%
not not built upon
 
00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:03.560 align:start position:0%
IEP uh need or
 
00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
disability due to the fact that many
 
00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
students have crossovers between they
 
00:11:10.829 --> 00:11:10.839 align:start position:0%
have multiple handicapped areas they may
 
00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:12.760 align:start position:0%
have traumatic brain injury they may
 
00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
have another category physical uh uh OT
 
00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:21.160 align:start position:0%
uh physical therapy all that they do a a
 
00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:25.000 align:start position:0%
a student can have different I
 
00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:26.920 align:start position:0%
disabilities and so therefore we're
 
00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:28.480 align:start position:0%
doing it based upon the reporting that
 
00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
we do for DEA which so so if it's 80% or
 
00:11:34.829 --> 00:11:34.839 align:start position:0%
more of the time that's the category a
 
00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:37.360 align:start position:0%
if it's less than if it's you're in the
 
00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:40.240 align:start position:0%
room for only 20% of the time then it
 
00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:43.800 align:start position:0%
would be category B and obviously that's
 
00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:49.320 align:start position:0%
a more costly uh weighted um uh need and
 
00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:51.480 align:start position:0%
so what we're trying to do is through
 
00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:54.800 align:start position:0%
this bill introduce as we did last year
 
00:11:56.949 --> 00:11:56.959 align:start position:0%
what came out of this committee
 
00:11:59.949 --> 00:11:59.959 align:start position:0%
unanimously went on to the the division
 
00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
2 in finance and it was incorporated
 
00:12:05.069 --> 00:12:05.079 align:start position:0%
into the bill which we sent across the
 
00:12:06.509 --> 00:12:06.519 align:start position:0%
aisle or
 
00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
wall the third category category C is
 
00:12:13.389 --> 00:12:13.399 align:start position:0%
identifies those students which are
 
00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:16.880 align:start position:0%
being schooled in their IEP homebound in
 
00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:17.990 align:start position:0%
being schooled in their IEP homebound in
a

00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
hospital 504 type medical situations or
 
00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
in a residential placement and it's
 
00:12:27.189 --> 00:12:27.199 align:start position:0%
obviously going to cost more there so we
 
00:12:29.509 --> 00:12:29.519 align:start position:0%
have a figure there which identifies
 
00:12:31.189 --> 00:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
$764 per pupil I understand that there
 
00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:36.680 align:start position:0%
are going to be those saying this is not
 
00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
enough and that this doesn't meet the
 
00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:42.120 align:start position:0%
true cost of that seeing that in the cat
 
00:12:44.269 --> 00:12:44.279 align:start position:0%
Aid we have to spend up to
 
00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:47.720 align:start position:0%
$70,000 before we get any support at all
 
00:12:51.189 --> 00:12:51.199 align:start position:0%
and we are short there this bill has
 
00:12:53.069 --> 00:12:53.079 align:start position:0%
been submitted because we know that
 
00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:54.600 align:start position:0%
there's been agreement with these
 
00:12:57.430 --> 00:12:57.440 align:start position:0%
categories in the past and that it will
 
00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
be part of the discussion tomorrow when
 
00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:02.360 align:start position:0%
we have a work session to really filter
 
00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:05.440 align:start position:0%
through and address how are we going to
 
00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:08.160 align:start position:0%
look at this whole issue of funding the
 
00:13:11.069 --> 00:13:11.079 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid categories are these
 
00:13:12.949 --> 00:13:12.959 align:start position:0%
the proper weights that will be
 
00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:15.480 align:start position:0%
determined at that body and and we'll
 
00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
also be looking at the other side of the
 
00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
coin is the cad a because they are sort
 
00:13:20.949 --> 00:13:20.959 align:start position:0%
of mixed together here and we're going
 
00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:23.480 align:start position:0%
to have to be filter out how to fund
 
00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
this U accordingly so Mr chair that does
 
00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
uh cover the changes which we have there
 
00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:32.720 align:start position:0%
uh there's other issues which we know we
 
00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:34.600 align:start position:0%
have to address with special education
 
00:13:36.949 --> 00:13:36.959 align:start position:0%
cat Aid special education Aid I like to
 
00:13:39.949 --> 00:13:39.959 align:start position:0%
I call it the wrong uh name now
 
00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
oldfashioned I guess pration has to be
 
00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:45.720 align:start position:0%
also adjusted figure thank
 
00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:48.240 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much for introducing
 
00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
the bill um
 
00:13:53.829 --> 00:13:53.839 align:start position:0%
so would you agree with my understanding
 
00:13:56.509 --> 00:13:56.519 align:start position:0%
that this bill tracks almost exactly the
 
00:13:58.350 --> 00:13:58.360 align:start position:0%
bill that passed out of the house last
 
00:14:00.829 --> 00:14:00.839 align:start position:0%
spring that's correct other than with
 
00:14:02.949 --> 00:14:02.959 align:start position:0%
minor adjustments to the figures that's
 
00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
that's correct yes very good thank you
 
00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:06.509 align:start position:0%
that's correct yes very good thank you
representative

00:14:06.509 --> 00:14:06.519 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:09.240 align:start position:0%
MCU thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:14:12.069 --> 00:14:12.079 align:start position:0%
taking my question so I was looking at
 
00:14:16.629 --> 00:14:16.639 align:start position:0%
existing uh law in this second part 198
 
00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:19.000 align:start position:0%
col 40a Part
 
00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:23.720 align:start position:0%
2D and it has the words um receiving
 
00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:26.240 align:start position:0%
special education services any time
 
00:14:29.509 --> 00:14:29.519 align:start position:0%
during the determination year and I
 
00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
don't see those words
 
00:14:36.629 --> 00:14:36.639 align:start position:0%
here so uh maybe those are unnecessary
 
00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
or what do you think I would think that
 
00:14:40.749 --> 00:14:40.759 align:start position:0%
that would be a discussion item for
 
00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:43.160 align:start position:0%
tomorrow but we also F have folks I'm
 
00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:44.600 align:start position:0%
looking around the room right now we
 
00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
have folks from the Department present I
 
00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:49.880 align:start position:0%
don't know if the director's here or not
 
00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:54.160 align:start position:0%
uh I saw uh Miss for for that she's here
 
00:14:58.110 --> 00:14:58.120 align:start position:0%
also hiding okay hiding behind Brian um
 
00:15:00.629 --> 00:15:00.639 align:start position:0%
yes I I think that's a question to ask
 
00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
ask them could I follow up yes so just
 
00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
in regardless of what it says but let's
 
00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:09.800 align:start position:0%
talk about whether it's a good idea or
 
00:15:12.829 --> 00:15:12.839 align:start position:0%
not um because this sounds to me like a
 
00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:16.040 align:start position:0%
school could boost their their payments
 
00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:19.000 align:start position:0%
several thousand doll just by giving
 
00:15:22.509 --> 00:15:22.519 align:start position:0%
someone special education services for a
 
00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
day right rather than somebody who's
 
00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:28.680 align:start position:0%
really you know permanently or often get
 
00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
special Education Services well
 
00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:34.160 align:start position:0%
to to to get special education services
 
00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:36.360 align:start position:0%
there's a whole process which you have
 
00:15:38.749 --> 00:15:38.759 align:start position:0%
to follow in accordance with our state
 
00:15:41.269 --> 00:15:41.279 align:start position:0%
Pro procedures spelled out in rules and
 
00:15:43.509 --> 00:15:43.519 align:start position:0%
in conjunction and paralleling federal
 
00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
law and there's a referral process
 
00:15:50.309 --> 00:15:50.319 align:start position:0%
there's by by the teacher by the parent
 
00:15:52.949 --> 00:15:52.959 align:start position:0%
you go through the IEP meetings and
 
00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
there's just just many many many steps I
 
00:15:58.990 --> 00:15:59.000 align:start position:0%
have yet in my life to see an IEP that's
 
00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
for a day uh it it just it's not logical
 
00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
although you know you may have a person
 
00:16:07.069 --> 00:16:07.079 align:start position:0%
that comes in and and comes to your
 
00:16:10.749 --> 00:16:10.759 align:start position:0%
school in the last 30 days that's uh it
 
00:16:12.949 --> 00:16:12.959 align:start position:0%
could be handicapped as they may need
 
00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
some help even during the summer months
 
00:16:16.389 --> 00:16:16.399 align:start position:0%
so you would go through and have that
 
00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
IEP meeting and the determination of
 
00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:20.920 align:start position:0%
what kind of objectives you're going to
 
00:16:22.309 --> 00:16:22.319 align:start position:0%
have what are going to be the goals of
 
00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:28.040 align:start position:0%
that IEP um so I you you can can this
 
00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
can be developed anytime during the
 
00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:30.920 align:start position:0%
course of the year but you got to
 
00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
remember your funding is based upon
 
00:16:35.069 --> 00:16:35.079 align:start position:0%
previous years it's not on the year that
 
00:16:35.079 --> 00:16:38.629 align:start position:0%
previous years it's not on the year that
you're

00:16:38.629 --> 00:16:38.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:46.680 align:start position:0%
Ames good morning good morning
 
00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
representative well I think this is a
 
00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:50.600 align:start position:0%
great Advance on
 
00:16:54.069 --> 00:16:54.079 align:start position:0%
uh on the existing single number
 
00:16:56.629 --> 00:16:56.639 align:start position:0%
arrangement for differentiate aid for
 
00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
special ad um I wonder if you could say
 
00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
a little bit more about how the the
 
00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:05.360 align:start position:0%
three numbers were arrived on so you got
 
00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:06.230 align:start position:0%
three numbers were arrived on so you got
three

00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:06.240 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:09.160 align:start position:0%
categories and um there are
 
00:17:13.069 --> 00:17:13.079 align:start position:0%
obviously um best estimates of uh costs
 
00:17:16.029 --> 00:17:16.039 align:start position:0%
in each category um and maybe you could
 
00:17:19.829 --> 00:17:19.839 align:start position:0%
flesh that okay the the the the first
 
00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:22.720 align:start position:0%
category a is that which has been
 
00:17:25.669 --> 00:17:25.679 align:start position:0%
projected in the FI 26 budget now so
 
00:17:27.829 --> 00:17:27.839 align:start position:0%
it's just coming up from the previous
 
00:17:30.029 --> 00:17:30.039 align:start position:0%
year with that 2% interest represent
 
00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:34.400 align:start position:0%
aims and this the when you get to
 
00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:39.000 align:start position:0%
category um B the
 
00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
$3,278 that's based on a 0.5 of that
 
00:17:46.789 --> 00:17:46.799 align:start position:0%
additional cost added onto that base and
 
00:17:50.549 --> 00:17:50.559 align:start position:0%
and for uh category
 
00:17:56.430 --> 00:17:56.440 align:start position:0%
um uh C the 7,648 it's the same process
 
00:17:58.510 --> 00:17:58.520 align:start position:0%
it was just multiplying that by another
 
00:17:59.950 --> 00:17:59.960 align:start position:0%
uh uh
 
00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:02.600 align:start position:0%
uh I believe it's a 1.5 or I'd have to
 
00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:04.400 align:start position:0%
look at it I this been a while since we
 
00:18:06.789 --> 00:18:06.799 align:start position:0%
put this together I know that when we
 
00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:08.240 align:start position:0%
had the commission study we were looking
 
00:18:11.669 --> 00:18:11.679 align:start position:0%
at even like a 4.9 or such as something
 
00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
such as that of a weighted of the base
 
00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:16.640 align:start position:0%
so that would if it's it rounded off to
 
00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
five so if your your base was at that
 
00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:19.830 align:start position:0%
five so if your your base was at that
time

00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
$4,000 you you can figure out we would
 
00:18:26.549 --> 00:18:26.559 align:start position:0%
be allocating 25 grand um I I think that
 
00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:29.360 align:start position:0%
the numbers here are not what we have to
 
00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:31.149 align:start position:0%
the numbers here are not what we have to
really

00:18:31.149 --> 00:18:31.159 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:34.600 align:start position:0%
um the concept that we want weighted
 
00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:36.760 align:start position:0%
formulas if you look at numbers of
 
00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:39.720 align:start position:0%
States we are one of the very few states
 
00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:42.400 align:start position:0%
that weights all our IEPs the 13
 
00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:45.520 align:start position:0%
categorical areas all the
 
00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:50.480 align:start position:0%
same that is is just not um sustainable
 
00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:53.400 align:start position:0%
on the part of the schools and this is
 
00:18:57.510 --> 00:18:57.520 align:start position:0%
why we're seeing folks saying and the
 
00:18:59.710 --> 00:18:59.720 align:start position:0%
most common comments I'm getting about
 
00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:01.960 align:start position:0%
our whole budget formula is from school
 
00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:04.120 align:start position:0%
district saying special ed costs are
 
00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
just going up high here and yeah our
 
00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:09.960 align:start position:0%
population's decreasing not so
 
00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily with with the special
 
00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
education in fact the ratio we have you
 
00:19:17.549 --> 00:19:17.559 align:start position:0%
know still we up in the 30 plus thousand
 
00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:19.960 align:start position:0%
ra uh number of kids that are receiving
 
00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:22.520 align:start position:0%
IPS versus was basically the same back
 
00:19:24.909 --> 00:19:24.919 align:start position:0%
10 years ago and but our demographic
 
00:19:26.029 --> 00:19:26.039 align:start position:0%
certainly going
 
00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
down we're not you're there's a lot of
 
00:19:33.149 --> 00:19:33.159 align:start position:0%
unfunded costs based upon the
 
00:19:33.159 --> 00:19:34.789 align:start position:0%
unfunded costs based upon the
singular

00:19:34.789 --> 00:19:34.799 align:start position:0%
singular
 
00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
waiting we need to look at that concept
 
00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:39.440 align:start position:0%
of waiting and I think we're all in
 
00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:41.480 align:start position:0%
agreement there's got to be some kind of
 
00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
a weight given exactly what it's going
 
00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:46.520 align:start position:0%
to be the 4.9 or this one right you see
 
00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:49.360 align:start position:0%
right here that's up for a discussion
 
00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:52.440 align:start position:0%
and one of the guiding lights is that we
 
00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:54.400 align:start position:0%
we we see out there with cat Aid right
 
00:19:57.390 --> 00:19:57.400 align:start position:0%
now that people are complaining you know
 
00:19:59.149 --> 00:19:59.159 align:start position:0%
I can't we the difference between 34
 
00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
million and and and uh and the
 
00:20:06.669 --> 00:20:06.679 align:start position:0%
uh that we allocated for that verse the
 
00:20:09.149 --> 00:20:09.159 align:start position:0%
$17 million on top of that as actual
 
00:20:12.549 --> 00:20:12.559 align:start position:0%
costs um that's not sustainable and this
 
00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
is not really sustainable either we need
 
00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
to address it and this
 
00:20:20.909 --> 00:20:20.919 align:start position:0%
is been introduced because it was very
 
00:20:22.669 --> 00:20:22.679 align:start position:0%
much liked and appreciated by the
 
00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:24.600 align:start position:0%
committee last year and it was same
 
00:20:26.909 --> 00:20:26.919 align:start position:0%
thing I believe in division
 
00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
two it's just that the cost figure is
 
00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:32.120 align:start position:0%
what we got to look
 
00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:35.430 align:start position:0%
what we got to look
at

00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:39.669 --> 00:20:39.679 align:start position:0%
yes one followup is U just to nail this
 
00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
down the um what you referred to as CAD
 
00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:46.240 align:start position:0%
a but uh we're not supposed to do that
 
00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
it's high-end special needs very
 
00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:53.960 align:start position:0%
high-end um in terms of cost uh is not
 
00:20:55.470 --> 00:20:55.480 align:start position:0%
touched by
 
00:20:58.270 --> 00:20:58.280 align:start position:0%
this we will have legislation to address
 
00:21:01.029 --> 00:21:01.039 align:start position:0%
those 640 some OD kids are thereabouts
 
00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:03.480 align:start position:0%
that are receiving that CAD Aid and we
 
00:21:06.029 --> 00:21:06.039 align:start position:0%
know where based upon and there folks
 
00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:07.640 align:start position:0%
here in the room that can tell us where
 
00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
the majority of those kids are within
 
00:21:12.269 --> 00:21:12.279 align:start position:0%
that spectrum and where what the costs
 
00:21:16.269 --> 00:21:16.279 align:start position:0%
are that is uh another part of law which
 
00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
is not this as you well know but when we
 
00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:20.480 align:start position:0%
had the committee last year and you were
 
00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
on it the subcommittee where we had you
 
00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:25.880 align:start position:0%
from Ways and Means and another person
 
00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
up there sending up front of me from
 
00:21:29.909 --> 00:21:29.919 align:start position:0%
Ways and Means and then we had some from
 
00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:32.320 align:start position:0%
finance and we had those which were
 
00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:36.760 align:start position:0%
policy uh we all saw that this process
 
00:21:38.390 --> 00:21:38.400 align:start position:0%
needs to be looked at
 
00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
seriously and recognized that weighted
 
00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:43.360 align:start position:0%
formulas in differentiate may be one of
 
00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:47.400 align:start position:0%
the ways which we address this thank you
 
00:21:51.669 --> 00:21:51.679 align:start position:0%
y any further questions so just just to
 
00:21:53.789 --> 00:21:53.799 align:start position:0%
summarize as this committee goes into
 
00:21:56.710 --> 00:21:56.720 align:start position:0%
work session this bill brings to us the
 
00:21:59.110 --> 00:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
component of differentiating the special
 
00:22:02.149 --> 00:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
Aid categories that may change shape it
 
00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
gets away from the singular amount of
 
00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:06.440 align:start position:0%
money within our costing formula yes
 
00:22:08.510 --> 00:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
okay and the other component regarding
 
00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:11.960 align:start position:0%
the uh formly referred to catastrophic
 
00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:14.320 align:start position:0%
will also be with us at the same time
 
00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
that's right we will be looking at that
 
00:22:18.269 --> 00:22:18.279 align:start position:0%
as you know I have a teleconference
 
00:22:20.789 --> 00:22:20.799 align:start position:0%
coming up with folks from Arkansas uh
 
00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
tomorrow looking at what they're doing
 
00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
with special education Aid and their
 
00:22:27.870 --> 00:22:27.880 align:start position:0%
Foundation formula looking for all other
 
00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:30.240 align:start position:0%
alternatives other approaches I think we
 
00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
have to be open to that uh in terms of
 
00:22:37.269 --> 00:22:37.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:39.549 --> 00:22:39.559 align:start position:0%
Education very good thank you for the
 
00:22:42.789 --> 00:22:42.799 align:start position:0%
introduction thank you very
 
00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:44.960 align:start position:0%
much next I'm going to call
 
00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:56.789 --> 00:22:56.799 align:start position:0%
dry thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:22:58.909 --> 00:22:58.919 align:start position:0%
committee for hearing this for the
 
00:23:00.909 --> 00:23:00.919 align:start position:0%
record I'm representative Margaret dry I
 
00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
serve Sullivan district 7 the towns of
 
00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:06.440 align:start position:0%
planfield Cornish Newport unity and
 
00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
Charlestown and and I'm here today to
 
00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:11.440 align:start position:0%
basically back up what representative
 
00:23:13.789 --> 00:23:13.799 align:start position:0%
lad just said uh serving on the
 
00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
subcommittee on education funding last
 
00:23:19.549 --> 00:23:19.559 align:start position:0%
year like a number of us in the room did
 
00:23:22.669 --> 00:23:22.679 align:start position:0%
um I felt that this differentiation and
 
00:23:25.149 --> 00:23:25.159 align:start position:0%
categories for special education was one
 
00:23:27.549 --> 00:23:27.559 align:start position:0%
of the best ideas that came out of that
 
00:23:27.559 --> 00:23:29.430 align:start position:0%
of the best ideas that came out of that
subcommittee

00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:29.440 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
00:23:32.350 --> 00:23:32.360 align:start position:0%
um I want I'm just here to advocate for
 
00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
that idea I know that the the next bill
 
00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:37.360 align:start position:0%
talks about a lump sum for special
 
00:23:38.789 --> 00:23:38.799 align:start position:0%
education that you you'll hear this
 
00:23:41.269 --> 00:23:41.279 align:start position:0%
morning but I find that that's kind of
 
00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:43.960 align:start position:0%
like firing Buckshot at a TIG Target
 
00:23:45.669 --> 00:23:45.679 align:start position:0%
you're wasting ammunition you may hit
 
00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:48.360 align:start position:0%
some of the target but it's not really
 
00:23:51.789 --> 00:23:51.799 align:start position:0%
um a a wise way to use your resources
 
00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
and I feel like the targeted categories
 
00:23:56.350 --> 00:23:56.360 align:start position:0%
send our money to the places where
 
00:23:58.750 --> 00:23:58.760 align:start position:0%
they're they're needed and makes
 
00:24:00.789 --> 00:24:00.799 align:start position:0%
differentiation because there really is
 
00:24:02.909 --> 00:24:02.919 align:start position:0%
differentiation in the kind of services
 
00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:05.480 align:start position:0%
that are provided so I'm just asking
 
00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:08.440 align:start position:0%
that as you may disagree on how much and
 
00:24:10.990 --> 00:24:11.000 align:start position:0%
what percentage to make these categories
 
00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
I really hope that as you go forward
 
00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:15.240 align:start position:0%
with this that you will support this
 
00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:17.840 align:start position:0%
theory of really differentiated
 
00:24:20.190 --> 00:24:20.200 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid thank
 
00:24:22.830 --> 00:24:22.840 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much questions from
 
00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:24.549 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much questions from
the

00:24:24.549 --> 00:24:24.559 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:27.000 align:start position:0%
committee so you would be perfectly
 
00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:29.200 align:start position:0%
comfortable with the idea if we evolved
 
00:24:31.230 --> 00:24:31.240 align:start position:0%
it that way to have even further
 
00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:33.480 align:start position:0%
categories further differentiation I
 
00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
think I'm aware that other that yes
 
00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:40.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:58.389 --> 00:24:58.399 align:start position:0%
Dunham good morning my name is Bonnie
 
00:25:00.549 --> 00:25:00.559 align:start position:0%
dham and I live in marac New Hampshire
 
00:25:02.149 --> 00:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
and I'm here speaking on behalf of
 
00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
myself and my family um I'm the mom of a
 
00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:07.000 align:start position:0%
now adult son who received special
 
00:25:09.549 --> 00:25:09.559 align:start position:0%
education services and I find this bill
 
00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:11.080 align:start position:0%
to be one of the most dangerous ones
 
00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
I've seen in recent years um if a school
 
00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:16.120 align:start position:0%
district would receive an additional
 
00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:18.120 align:start position:0%
almost $1,100 for child with a
 
00:25:19.669 --> 00:25:19.679 align:start position:0%
disability spent most of their day
 
00:25:22.149 --> 00:25:22.159 align:start position:0%
served apart from their typical peers
 
00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
instead of in a general education
 
00:25:27.789 --> 00:25:27.799 align:start position:0%
classroom and then and then $5,000 more
 
00:25:30.269 --> 00:25:30.279 align:start position:0%
than $5,000 ,000 additional If instead
 
00:25:31.669 --> 00:25:31.679 align:start position:0%
they place that child in a fully
 
00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:33.480 align:start position:0%
segregated placement instead of in the
 
00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
General Ed classroom with supports that
 
00:25:37.669 --> 00:25:37.679 align:start position:0%
gives a tremendous Financial incentive
 
00:25:39.549 --> 00:25:39.559 align:start position:0%
to place a child in a more restrictive
 
00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:41.640 align:start position:0%
environment I strongly believe if this
 
00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
bill passes we'll see fewer and fewer
 
00:25:45.149 --> 00:25:45.159 align:start position:0%
children with disabilities learning in
 
00:25:47.230 --> 00:25:47.240 align:start position:0%
regular classrooms alongside their
 
00:25:48.669 --> 00:25:48.679 align:start position:0%
friends and neighbors brothers and
 
00:25:50.549 --> 00:25:50.559 align:start position:0%
sisters which would be a tragedy for
 
00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
both children with and without
 
00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
disabilities in contrast with Federal
 
00:25:57.110 --> 00:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
idea says to the maximum extent
 
00:25:58.710 --> 00:25:58.720 align:start position:0%
appropriate children with disabilities
 
00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:00.440 align:start position:0%
are educated with children who are not
 
00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:02.600 align:start position:0%
disabled in special classes separate
 
00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:04.720 align:start position:0%
schooling or other removal of children
 
00:26:06.310 --> 00:26:06.320 align:start position:0%
with disabilities from the regular
 
00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:08.200 align:start position:0%
environment occurs only when the nature
 
00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:09.960 align:start position:0%
or severity of the disability of the
 
00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
child is such that education and regular
 
00:26:13.870 --> 00:26:13.880 align:start position:0%
classes even with the use of
 
00:26:15.630 --> 00:26:15.640 align:start position:0%
supplementary AIDS and services cannot
 
00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:18.240 align:start position:0%
be achieved satisfactorily later in the
 
00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:20.760 align:start position:0%
analysis of comments they they note that
 
00:26:22.269 --> 00:26:22.279 align:start position:0%
the intent is that the funding
 
00:26:24.149 --> 00:26:24.159 align:start position:0%
mechanisms support the LR least
 
00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:26.000 align:start position:0%
restrictive environment requirements and
 
00:26:27.630 --> 00:26:27.640 align:start position:0%
do not provide an incentive or
 
00:26:29.230 --> 00:26:29.240 align:start position:0%
disincentive for certain placement
 
00:26:32.149 --> 00:26:32.159 align:start position:0%
decisions this does my husband and I
 
00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
worked very hard with our school
 
00:26:35.909 --> 00:26:35.919 align:start position:0%
district to ensure that our son Sean who
 
00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:38.720 align:start position:0%
complicated young guy um received the
 
00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:40.440 align:start position:0%
majority of his of his education and
 
00:26:42.029 --> 00:26:42.039 align:start position:0%
general education settings with his
 
00:26:44.590 --> 00:26:44.600 align:start position:0%
typical peers he needed a full-time pair
 
00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
professional to support him he had a
 
00:26:49.230 --> 00:26:49.240 align:start position:0%
behavior plan he received spe a lot of
 
00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
services because he needed them and
 
00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
accommodating his disability sometimes
 
00:26:55.630 --> 00:26:55.640 align:start position:0%
required creative collaborative problem
 
00:26:57.710 --> 00:26:57.720 align:start position:0%
solving but in addition to learning
 
00:26:59.870 --> 00:26:59.880 align:start position:0%
academic and functional skills he was
 
00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
able to model appropriate behavior
 
00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:03.480 align:start position:0%
language and social skills from his
 
00:27:05.950 --> 00:27:05.960 align:start position:0%
peers while they learned from him his
 
00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
education and general education classes
 
00:27:09.909 --> 00:27:09.919 align:start position:0%
and in inclusive extracurricular
 
00:27:11.789 --> 00:27:11.799 align:start position:0%
activities prepared him to be a fully
 
00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
participating and contributing member of
 
00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:16.640 align:start position:0%
our community which he is when sea was
 
00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:18.320 align:start position:0%
in school there were several children
 
00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:20.200 align:start position:0%
whose special education needs were
 
00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:22.640 align:start position:0%
pretty similar to his um who spent the
 
00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:24.520 align:start position:0%
majority of their day in a separate
 
00:27:27.310 --> 00:27:27.320 align:start position:0%
special education classroom the cost to
 
00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:28.640 align:start position:0%
educate those children in their
 
00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:30.520 align:start position:0%
self-contained classroom was probably
 
00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
about the same to Ed as to educate Sean
 
00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
in the General Ed setting in CA in fact
 
00:27:38.269 --> 00:27:38.279 align:start position:0%
he might have cost a little bit more um
 
00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
but under this funding scheme the school
 
00:27:43.669 --> 00:27:43.679 align:start position:0%
district would have received $1,000 more
 
00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:45.440 align:start position:0%
for those kids than they would for my
 
00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:49.120 align:start position:0%
son even if he cost more um that it just
 
00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:51.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't make any sense to me um that
 
00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:52.960 align:start position:0%
would have essentially penalized the
 
00:27:55.029 --> 00:27:55.039 align:start position:0%
school district for serving him in in
 
00:27:57.389 --> 00:27:57.399 align:start position:0%
the inclusive settings that so clearly
 
00:27:59.830 --> 00:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
benefited him in school and in his adult
 
00:28:02.590 --> 00:28:02.600 align:start position:0%
life I really can't imagine how horrible
 
00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:04.760 align:start position:0%
his life would have been would be today
 
00:28:06.990 --> 00:28:07.000 align:start position:0%
if this Bill had been in effect then
 
00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
yesterday someone who apparently came
 
00:28:11.950 --> 00:28:11.960 align:start position:0%
from the future referred to um use the
 
00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:14.760 align:start position:0%
term a category C student what a
 
00:28:16.669 --> 00:28:16.679 align:start position:0%
stigmatizing label children with
 
00:28:18.430 --> 00:28:18.440 align:start position:0%
disabilities don't need another label
 
00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:20.320 align:start position:0%
and they don't need to be referred to by
 
00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:23.200 align:start position:0%
their placements um and if you think
 
00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:25.320 align:start position:0%
that categories are important please
 
00:28:26.990 --> 00:28:27.000 align:start position:0%
base them on how much the child's
 
00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:29.360 align:start position:0%
Services cost just like we do with
 
00:28:31.509 --> 00:28:31.519 align:start position:0%
special education Aid why not mirror
 
00:28:33.870 --> 00:28:33.880 align:start position:0%
that and provide funding based on on the
 
00:28:36.110 --> 00:28:36.120 align:start position:0%
actual cost of the child instead of the
 
00:28:38.389 --> 00:28:38.399 align:start position:0%
placement I suspect that once a child
 
00:28:41.470 --> 00:28:41.480 align:start position:0%
gets that category C student label it'll
 
00:28:43.630 --> 00:28:43.640 align:start position:0%
be really hard for them to move into a
 
00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:46.320 align:start position:0%
category b or a category a because there
 
00:28:47.789 --> 00:28:47.799 align:start position:0%
will have been that
 
00:28:51.269 --> 00:28:51.279 align:start position:0%
self-determined stigma that comes along
 
00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
um two two years ago an almost identical
 
00:28:56.669 --> 00:28:56.679 align:start position:0%
bill was introduced and then there was
 
00:28:59.070 --> 00:28:59.080 align:start position:0%
another one neither pass there's a
 
00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:02.240 align:start position:0%
reason for that um but here we are again
 
00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:04.320 align:start position:0%
it doesn't make sense please recommend
 
00:29:07.669 --> 00:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
this bill itl and if again if you think
 
00:29:09.230 --> 00:29:09.240 align:start position:0%
you need categories based them on the
 
00:29:11.590 --> 00:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
need not on the placement because
 
00:29:15.029 --> 00:29:15.039 align:start position:0%
sometimes a more a placement in a in a
 
00:29:16.909 --> 00:29:16.919 align:start position:0%
regular IDE classroom can be more
 
00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
expensive and so don't penalize school
 
00:29:20.549 --> 00:29:20.559 align:start position:0%
districts because they do the right
 
00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:21.480 align:start position:0%
thing for
 
00:29:24.549 --> 00:29:24.559 align:start position:0%
kids thank you yeah thank you very much
 
00:29:27.070 --> 00:29:27.080 align:start position:0%
I appreciate the personal perspective
 
00:29:28.909 --> 00:29:28.919 align:start position:0%
representative guire
 
00:29:30.430 --> 00:29:30.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thanks for coming
 
00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
and taking my question you you said
 
00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
twice that um placement in a separate
 
00:29:40.110 --> 00:29:40.120 align:start position:0%
room could be cheaper than in the in the
 
00:29:43.029 --> 00:29:43.039 align:start position:0%
regular room and I can you explain more
 
00:29:45.870 --> 00:29:45.880 align:start position:0%
detail how that can happen Okay so if my
 
00:29:47.909 --> 00:29:47.919 align:start position:0%
son had been in that special education
 
00:29:49.870 --> 00:29:49.880 align:start position:0%
classroom all day he wouldn't have
 
00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:51.720 align:start position:0%
needed a par
 
00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:54.600 align:start position:0%
professional he may not have needed a
 
00:29:58.990 --> 00:29:59.000 align:start position:0%
behavior plan because that was a pretty
 
00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:02.080 align:start position:0%
uh structured like hyper structive
 
00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:04.640 align:start position:0%
structured environment because he did
 
00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
need those Services because the law says
 
00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:08.960 align:start position:0%
you can only be pulled out if even with
 
00:30:10.509 --> 00:30:10.519 align:start position:0%
supplementary AIDS and services your
 
00:30:13.669 --> 00:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
needs cannot be met there his could um
 
00:30:17.269 --> 00:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
and so even if it cost a little more he
 
00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:18.760 align:start position:0%
had a right to be in that regular
 
00:30:21.149 --> 00:30:21.159 align:start position:0%
classroom and it made a huge difference
 
00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:24.440 align:start position:0%
in his life when we go out in town
 
00:30:26.590 --> 00:30:26.600 align:start position:0%
people know him they don't know those
 
00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
other kids when they went through the
 
00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:30.640 align:start position:0%
graduation he got lots of Cheers because
 
00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:32.240 align:start position:0%
everyone knew who he was when those
 
00:30:35.269 --> 00:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
other kids went got up none of the other
 
00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:36.840 align:start position:0%
kids knew who they were because they
 
00:30:39.310 --> 00:30:39.320 align:start position:0%
spent their day in a little room
 
00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:47.870 --> 00:30:47.880 align:start position:0%
else yes represent mean thank you Mr
 
00:30:49.389 --> 00:30:49.399 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for coming in and
 
00:30:51.310 --> 00:30:51.320 align:start position:0%
thank you especially for your testimony
 
00:30:53.789 --> 00:30:53.799 align:start position:0%
um I I recognize the dangers that you're
 
00:30:55.549 --> 00:30:55.559 align:start position:0%
highlighting but um I'm assuming that
 
00:30:58.750 --> 00:30:58.760 align:start position:0%
you sat in many times in the
 
00:31:01.549 --> 00:31:01.559 align:start position:0%
IEP um sessions with the with the IEP
 
00:31:03.950 --> 00:31:03.960 align:start position:0%
specialist do you do you imagine that
 
00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:05.440 align:start position:0%
they would have treated your son any
 
00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:08.120 align:start position:0%
different if they have been motivated by
 
00:31:10.789 --> 00:31:10.799 align:start position:0%
by funds or would they have since the
 
00:31:12.470 --> 00:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
Mandate is to put your son in the least
 
00:31:14.909 --> 00:31:14.919 align:start position:0%
restrictive environment would they not
 
00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:17.080 align:start position:0%
have pushed for that instead of pushing
 
00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:20.440 align:start position:0%
for for a higher pay sometimes it
 
00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:24.320 align:start position:0%
sometimes the line between a child what
 
00:31:25.909 --> 00:31:25.919 align:start position:0%
placement is appropriate for a child can
 
00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:29.120 align:start position:0%
be pretty fine um and on the
 
00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:31.320 align:start position:0%
surface it would have made sense for him
 
00:31:34.029 --> 00:31:34.039 align:start position:0%
to be in a special ed classroom but we
 
00:31:36.750 --> 00:31:36.760 align:start position:0%
were able to find by being really
 
00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:39.320 align:start position:0%
creative the right combination of
 
00:31:41.629 --> 00:31:41.639 align:start position:0%
supports for him so that he was able to
 
00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:44.360 align:start position:0%
be in that regular education setting um
 
00:31:46.669 --> 00:31:46.679 align:start position:0%
so people would make decisions I think
 
00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
based on that it would be easier to to
 
00:31:52.230 --> 00:31:52.240 align:start position:0%
do that the town hall meetings I people
 
00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
would be saying those category C
 
00:31:55.950 --> 00:31:55.960 align:start position:0%
students are the reason our taxes are so
 
00:31:58.269 --> 00:31:58.279 align:start position:0%
high now they just say kids with
 
00:32:00.549 --> 00:32:00.559 align:start position:0%
disabilities are the reason your your
 
00:32:01.990 --> 00:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
insights are invaluable to this
 
00:32:05.310 --> 00:32:05.320 align:start position:0%
committee um do you suppose that if the
 
00:32:06.789 --> 00:32:06.799 align:start position:0%
if the school had been offered more
 
00:32:08.430 --> 00:32:08.440 align:start position:0%
money to put your child your child
 
00:32:10.029 --> 00:32:10.039 align:start position:0%
somewhere else they would have changed
 
00:32:12.110 --> 00:32:12.120 align:start position:0%
his IEP in order to get more money or
 
00:32:14.870 --> 00:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
would you have pushed with with the
 
00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:16.360 align:start position:0%
consultation that was going on would you
 
00:32:17.629 --> 00:32:17.639 align:start position:0%
have pushed to keep him in the least
 
00:32:19.710 --> 00:32:19.720 align:start position:0%
restrictive environment it would have
 
00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
certainly made it a very attractive
 
00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
Prospect for them to suggest that maybe
 
00:32:26.990 --> 00:32:27.000 align:start position:0%
you know maybe he would have been better
 
00:32:29.549 --> 00:32:29.559 align:start position:0%
off in that Reg special education
 
00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:32.760 align:start position:0%
classroom I would have fought to my
 
00:32:35.310 --> 00:32:35.320 align:start position:0%
dying day for him never to spend his
 
00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:37.720 align:start position:0%
time apart from his peers he is an
 
00:32:40.350 --> 00:32:40.360 align:start position:0%
individual who is just a person before
 
00:32:43.549 --> 00:32:43.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:46.669 --> 00:32:46.679 align:start position:0%
disability it's good way have parents
 
00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:49.080 align:start position:0%
thank you okay thank you any other
 
00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee very good
 
00:32:55.470 --> 00:32:55.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:58.470 --> 00:32:58.480 align:start position:0%
testimony um next uh I'm going to call
 
00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:08.269 align:start position:0%
testimony um next uh I'm going to call
Karen

00:33:08.269 --> 00:33:08.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
Rosenberg good morning I'm Karen
 
00:33:12.149 --> 00:33:12.159 align:start position:0%
Rosenberg I'm the policy director at the
 
00:33:13.909 --> 00:33:13.919 align:start position:0%
disability rights Center New Hampshire
 
00:33:16.149 --> 00:33:16.159 align:start position:0%
I'm also an attorney and I've practiced
 
00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:18.320 align:start position:0%
in the area of special education law for
 
00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
quite some time um I'm here to testify
 
00:33:22.669 --> 00:33:22.679 align:start position:0%
in opposition to this bill but I have to
 
00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
say it's reluctantly because I really
 
00:33:27.990 --> 00:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
understand that your committee is has
 
00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:31.360 align:start position:0%
very challenging charge here and um we
 
00:33:34.590 --> 00:33:34.600 align:start position:0%
are you know you you're working
 
00:33:36.509 --> 00:33:36.519 align:start position:0%
diligently to try to figure out a way to
 
00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:38.320 align:start position:0%
support schools and provide the funding
 
00:33:40.669 --> 00:33:40.679 align:start position:0%
that is needed to educate all of our
 
00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
students in a rather challenging um time
 
00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
right budget wise so um I just want to I
 
00:33:50.950 --> 00:33:50.960 align:start position:0%
think that the issue that we have with
 
00:33:53.669 --> 00:33:53.679 align:start position:0%
the bill really is that it it's really
 
00:33:55.830 --> 00:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
distinguishing those category it's the
 
00:33:57.430 --> 00:33:57.440 align:start position:0%
category a and category B that would be
 
00:33:59.669 --> 00:33:59.679 align:start position:0%
created here because I think what it
 
00:34:03.509 --> 00:34:03.519 align:start position:0%
would do is unintentionally perhaps
 
00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:06.600 align:start position:0%
result in students who are in their
 
00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:09.040 align:start position:0%
Public Schools who have disabilities
 
00:34:12.389 --> 00:34:12.399 align:start position:0%
being sort of siphoned off for
 
00:34:14.669 --> 00:34:14.679 align:start position:0%
increasingly long per longer periods of
 
00:34:18.109 --> 00:34:18.119 align:start position:0%
time into more restrictive settings um
 
00:34:21.069 --> 00:34:21.079 align:start position:0%
and that as you heard from Bonnie Dunham
 
00:34:23.310 --> 00:34:23.320 align:start position:0%
is just really harmful kids have a right
 
00:34:25.829 --> 00:34:25.839 align:start position:0%
to be educated with their peers in the
 
00:34:28.030 --> 00:34:28.040 align:start position:0%
least restrictive environment and if
 
00:34:29.669 --> 00:34:29.679 align:start position:0%
they can if that can be accomplished
 
00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
with supports in the regular education
 
00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:34.720 align:start position:0%
classroom that's what they need to have
 
00:34:38.389 --> 00:34:38.399 align:start position:0%
and so the way that I read this bill and
 
00:34:40.629 --> 00:34:40.639 align:start position:0%
maybe I missed something and please
 
00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:42.720 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong is that for
 
00:34:44.589 --> 00:34:44.599 align:start position:0%
students who would be placed in the
 
00:34:46.470 --> 00:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
regular education classroom for more
 
00:34:50.069 --> 00:34:50.079 align:start position:0%
than 80% of the day there would be the
 
00:34:52.750 --> 00:34:52.760 align:start position:0%
the lowest amount that would be added on
 
00:34:55.430 --> 00:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
in terms of adequacy for students that
 
00:34:58.510 --> 00:34:58.520 align:start position:0%
are placed in the regular education
 
00:35:03.430 --> 00:35:03.440 align:start position:0%
classroom for 79% 78%
 
00:35:06.390 --> 00:35:06.400 align:start position:0%
75% there would be a bump and so
 
00:35:09.150 --> 00:35:09.160 align:start position:0%
although you know people people are
 
00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
people we all come to these IEP te
 
00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
meetings with the student in mind and
 
00:35:17.109 --> 00:35:17.119 align:start position:0%
you know the effort to place them in the
 
00:35:18.510 --> 00:35:18.520 align:start position:0%
least restrictive settings but as you
 
00:35:20.190 --> 00:35:20.200 align:start position:0%
heard from Bonnie like there are times
 
00:35:22.310 --> 00:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
when it is actually a bit more
 
00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:25.040 align:start position:0%
complicated to place a child in the
 
00:35:27.390 --> 00:35:27.400 align:start position:0%
regular education classroom for most or
 
00:35:30.430 --> 00:35:30.440 align:start position:0%
all their days and so it seems like
 
00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:32.640 align:start position:0%
having this kind of differentiation
 
00:35:34.910 --> 00:35:34.920 align:start position:0%
would disincentivize those creative
 
00:35:36.790 --> 00:35:36.800 align:start position:0%
discussions to make sure that students
 
00:35:38.270 --> 00:35:38.280 align:start position:0%
are getting what they need to enable
 
00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
them to be in that less restrictive
 
00:35:43.710 --> 00:35:43.720 align:start position:0%
setting um I'm less concerned about the
 
00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
students who are placed out of District
 
00:35:49.710 --> 00:35:49.720 align:start position:0%
in providing additional um funding tol
 
00:35:52.870 --> 00:35:52.880 align:start position:0%
to um reflect the additional cost um
 
00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:54.640 align:start position:0%
because I think that it it is still such
 
00:35:57.630 --> 00:35:57.640 align:start position:0%
a high cost for schools to place stud
 
00:36:00.430 --> 00:36:00.440 align:start position:0%
students in out of District placements
 
00:36:02.069 --> 00:36:02.079 align:start position:0%
that this wouldn't necessarily
 
00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:04.720 align:start position:0%
incentivize that it would probably you
 
00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:06.720 align:start position:0%
know and and I understand the
 
00:36:09.349 --> 00:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
difficulties with special education
 
00:36:12.430 --> 00:36:12.440 align:start position:0%
funding that formerly known as CAD a um
 
00:36:13.790 --> 00:36:13.800 align:start position:0%
because schools have to expend that
 
00:36:15.270 --> 00:36:15.280 align:start position:0%
money first and this would provide a
 
00:36:18.349 --> 00:36:18.359 align:start position:0%
little relief for that um but really I
 
00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
think that we want to make sure that
 
00:36:23.069 --> 00:36:23.079 align:start position:0%
schools have what they need um upfront
 
00:36:25.349 --> 00:36:25.359 align:start position:0%
if possible to provide the services that
 
00:36:27.230 --> 00:36:27.240 align:start position:0%
students with disabilities need to be in
 
00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
those these restrictive environments so
 
00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:32.560 align:start position:0%
um that's why as written we would oppose
 
00:36:34.190 --> 00:36:34.200 align:start position:0%
this and encourage you to think about
 
00:36:36.829 --> 00:36:36.839 align:start position:0%
whether it might be
 
00:36:40.510 --> 00:36:40.520 align:start position:0%
amended thank you very much so as I
 
00:36:42.430 --> 00:36:42.440 align:start position:0%
understand your concerns they relate
 
00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
more to um perverse incentives
 
00:36:47.349 --> 00:36:47.359 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding that current law
 
00:36:50.069 --> 00:36:50.079 align:start position:0%
requires least restrictive uh
 
00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:52.480 align:start position:0%
environment um do you share the view
 
00:36:55.349 --> 00:36:55.359 align:start position:0%
regarding stigma that was expressed by
 
00:36:58.550 --> 00:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
prior definitely I mean
 
00:37:00.069 --> 00:37:00.079 align:start position:0%
we don't live in a world when when
 
00:37:00.079 --> 00:37:01.069 align:start position:0%
we don't live in a world when when
students

00:37:01.069 --> 00:37:01.079 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:37:03.550 --> 00:37:03.560 align:start position:0%
graduate we live in a world where we're
 
00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
we're together right we don't we want
 
00:37:08.109 --> 00:37:08.119 align:start position:0%
people we want all of our students to be
 
00:37:10.750 --> 00:37:10.760 align:start position:0%
people in our society who are embraced
 
00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
and included in our society and by
 
00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:16.720 align:start position:0%
segregating students based on disability
 
00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:19.280 align:start position:0%
really early on we are basically
 
00:37:20.829 --> 00:37:20.839 align:start position:0%
teaching everybody else in the school
 
00:37:23.109 --> 00:37:23.119 align:start position:0%
these are other these are different
 
00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:24.400 align:start position:0%
these are these these aren't these
 
00:37:26.589 --> 00:37:26.599 align:start position:0%
people aren't like you're you people are
 
00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:28.440 align:start position:0%
and I I think that is how we start
 
00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:29.550 align:start position:0%
and I I think that is how we start
creating

00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:29.560 align:start position:0%
creating
 
00:37:32.790 --> 00:37:32.800 align:start position:0%
stigma thank you yes representative
 
00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:34.190 align:start position:0%
stigma thank you yes representative

papich
 
00:37:36.790 --> 00:37:36.800 align:start position:0%
Miller thank you Mr chairman I would
 
00:37:38.589 --> 00:37:38.599 align:start position:0%
first like to apologize briefly to my
 
00:37:39.950 --> 00:37:39.960 align:start position:0%
colleagues and to everybody in the room
 
00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:42.040 align:start position:0%
for being late I was under the mistaken
 
00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:44.640 align:start position:0%
impression the hearing started at then I
 
00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:48.240 align:start position:0%
I I apologize but um I I hear you you
 
00:37:50.589 --> 00:37:50.599 align:start position:0%
know Express concern about both a
 
00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:52.640 align:start position:0%
perverse incentive in terms of different
 
00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
levels of funding by category and then
 
00:37:58.190 --> 00:37:58.200 align:start position:0%
in terms of stigma by
 
00:38:00.349 --> 00:38:00.359 align:start position:0%
categorizing could you tell me what are
 
00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
your current concerns today with the
 
00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
current system where students are
 
00:38:07.589 --> 00:38:07.599 align:start position:0%
categorized as special education funding
 
00:38:09.550 --> 00:38:09.560 align:start position:0%
students therefore there would be a
 
00:38:11.829 --> 00:38:11.839 align:start position:0%
stigma they are given additional funding
 
00:38:13.309 --> 00:38:13.319 align:start position:0%
therefore there is an incentive to
 
00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
categorize them as special education how
 
00:38:18.109 --> 00:38:18.119 align:start position:0%
do you feel this would be different with
 
00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:20.640 align:start position:0%
this bill versus the current system well
 
00:38:22.750 --> 00:38:22.760 align:start position:0%
I I think that right now I mean we have
 
00:38:25.109 --> 00:38:25.119 align:start position:0%
a federal law that requires schools to
 
00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:27.720 align:start position:0%
educate students with disabilities and
 
00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:29.440 align:start position:0%
understand and recognizes that it is
 
00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
more expensive overall to educate
 
00:38:34.190 --> 00:38:34.200 align:start position:0%
students who have disabilities but we
 
00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
are not um drilling down to the point
 
00:38:40.030 --> 00:38:40.040 align:start position:0%
where we are um through our law and our
 
00:38:42.750 --> 00:38:42.760 align:start position:0%
funding scheme influencing where those
 
00:38:44.510 --> 00:38:44.520 align:start position:0%
students are going to be educated or how
 
00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:46.400 align:start position:0%
their education is going to be delivered
 
00:38:50.390 --> 00:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:54.589 --> 00:38:54.599 align:start position:0%
here thank you other questions from the
 
00:38:58.069 --> 00:38:58.079 align:start position:0%
committee do you
 
00:38:59.630 --> 00:38:59.640 align:start position:0%
I'm not asking uh whether you have
 
00:39:01.589 --> 00:39:01.599 align:start position:0%
language prepared but when you said that
 
00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:03.480 align:start position:0%
perhaps there's an amendment that would
 
00:39:05.309 --> 00:39:05.319 align:start position:0%
address your problem conceptually what
 
00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
would that look like I I think what the
 
00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:09.680 align:start position:0%
amendment would do instead would be to
 
00:39:12.069 --> 00:39:12.079 align:start position:0%
increase would one idea would be to
 
00:39:15.349 --> 00:39:15.359 align:start position:0%
increase the amount of um adequacy for
 
00:39:17.349 --> 00:39:17.359 align:start position:0%
students identified as needing special
 
00:39:20.069 --> 00:39:20.079 align:start position:0%
education by a fixed amount that's
 
00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:23.440 align:start position:0%
higher than we currently provide um or
 
00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:28.160 align:start position:0%
figure out a way to um perhaps pay pay
 
00:39:30.309 --> 00:39:30.319 align:start position:0%
UPF front some of some of the special ed
 
00:39:32.589 --> 00:39:32.599 align:start position:0%
Aid formerly known as CAD Aid feels like
 
00:39:35.829 --> 00:39:35.839 align:start position:0%
artists formerly known as Prince but um
 
00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
to to figure out a way if there's a way
 
00:39:40.030 --> 00:39:40.040 align:start position:0%
to pay some of that UPF front because
 
00:39:41.990 --> 00:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
when we know it is when when a
 
00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
students's least restrictive environment
 
00:39:47.950 --> 00:39:47.960 align:start position:0%
to get a to um receive a a fape a free
 
00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate public education is out of
 
00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
District that is extremely costly so
 
00:39:54.349 --> 00:39:54.359 align:start position:0%
perhaps another idea would be to figure
 
00:39:58.069 --> 00:39:58.079 align:start position:0%
out a way in those um I have to C A
 
00:40:00.870 --> 00:40:00.880 align:start position:0%
those special education Aid bills to
 
00:40:03.589 --> 00:40:03.599 align:start position:0%
maybe Pro provide some upfront funding
 
00:40:05.910 --> 00:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
for those particular students or that
 
00:40:07.829 --> 00:40:07.839 align:start position:0%
might be a way to do it and and then
 
00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
increase the funding um for students
 
00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:12.240 align:start position:0%
that are maintained in the General Ed
 
00:40:14.470 --> 00:40:14.480 align:start position:0%
classroom perhaps create a greater
 
00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:15.790 align:start position:0%
classroom perhaps create a greater
incentive

00:40:15.790 --> 00:40:15.800 align:start position:0%
incentive
 
00:40:19.910 --> 00:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
to um financially to make sure there's
 
00:40:21.510 --> 00:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
adequate funds for students to be
 
00:40:23.190 --> 00:40:23.200 align:start position:0%
educated in the general class room I
 
00:40:24.309 --> 00:40:24.319 align:start position:0%
hadn't really thought it through
 
00:40:26.990 --> 00:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
entirely but I I think the problem with
 
00:40:29.870 --> 00:40:29.880 align:start position:0%
this is system is that it could
 
00:40:32.470 --> 00:40:32.480 align:start position:0%
inadvertently incentivize schools to not
 
00:40:34.510 --> 00:40:34.520 align:start position:0%
do what they need to do for kids and
 
00:40:36.230 --> 00:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
place them in the least restrictive
 
00:40:39.150 --> 00:40:39.160 align:start position:0%
their General Ed requirements General Ed

good morning um thank you all uh for
 
00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:16.440 align:start position:0%
allowing the time uh I did not actually
 
00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
indicate support or opposition um for
 
00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:22.200 align:start position:0%
this bill or or the one that follows
 
00:41:26.349 --> 00:41:26.359 align:start position:0%
because I think they are distinct um 563
 
00:41:27.990 --> 00:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
and and 603
 
00:41:30.270 --> 00:41:30.280 align:start position:0%
in that they one categorizes and the
 
00:41:33.109 --> 00:41:33.119 align:start position:0%
other does not I wanted to speak more
 
00:41:36.430 --> 00:41:36.440 align:start position:0%
towards um my concerns about an
 
00:41:37.790 --> 00:41:37.800 align:start position:0%
understanding of the cost to our
 
00:41:42.270 --> 00:41:42.280 align:start position:0%
districts for special education um and
 
00:41:43.870 --> 00:41:43.880 align:start position:0%
you know I I understand the concerns
 
00:41:46.069 --> 00:41:46.079 align:start position:0%
expressed by um those who've testified
 
00:41:48.829 --> 00:41:48.839 align:start position:0%
previously that we don't want to be
 
00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:51.720 align:start position:0%
creating an incentive system to remove
 
00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
students from the classroom more than is
 
00:41:55.589 --> 00:41:55.599 align:start position:0%
necessary for the least restrictive
 
00:41:59.030 --> 00:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
environment if this is happening
 
00:42:01.710 --> 00:42:01.720 align:start position:0%
properly the IEP team should be deciding
 
00:42:03.309 --> 00:42:03.319 align:start position:0%
the services needed and whether they're
 
00:42:05.670 --> 00:42:05.680 align:start position:0%
needed in a pullout setting or whether
 
00:42:07.109 --> 00:42:07.119 align:start position:0%
they can be pushed into the regular
 
00:42:11.670 --> 00:42:11.680 align:start position:0%
education classroom um I agree and um we
 
00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
we've all acknowledge in this feeli that
 
00:42:17.710 --> 00:42:17.720 align:start position:0%
sometimes inclusion is more expensive
 
00:42:20.069 --> 00:42:20.079 align:start position:0%
often because par Educators might be
 
00:42:22.190 --> 00:42:22.200 align:start position:0%
needed to help adapt material and to
 
00:42:24.270 --> 00:42:24.280 align:start position:0%
manage behaviors in a fully inclusive
 
00:42:26.430 --> 00:42:26.440 align:start position:0%
setting that wouldn't be needed in a
 
00:42:28.510 --> 00:42:28.520 align:start position:0%
setting where all that was already
 
00:42:31.230 --> 00:42:31.240 align:start position:0%
adapted but it again does not mean that
 
00:42:32.710 --> 00:42:32.720 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't be doing as much inclusion
 
00:42:36.630 --> 00:42:36.640 align:start position:0%
as possible um
 
00:42:40.510 --> 00:42:40.520 align:start position:0%
my uh Focus was more on the financial
 
00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:42.720 align:start position:0%
side of this because when we look at two
 
00:42:44.750 --> 00:42:44.760 align:start position:0%
different bills that are before this
 
00:42:46.670 --> 00:42:46.680 align:start position:0%
committee there are radically different
 
00:42:48.309 --> 00:42:48.319 align:start position:0%
dollars even if we were to take out all
 
00:42:50.710 --> 00:42:50.720 align:start position:0%
the categories which I understand are in
 
00:42:51.950 --> 00:42:51.960 align:start position:0%
there in part because those are
 
00:42:54.750 --> 00:42:54.760 align:start position:0%
categories within which our um State
 
00:42:56.510 --> 00:42:56.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Education needs to report
 
00:42:56.520 --> 00:42:57.670 align:start position:0%
Department of Education needs to report
to

00:42:57.670 --> 00:42:57.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
um the federal department of education
 
00:43:03.109 --> 00:43:03.119 align:start position:0%
for compliance purposes
 
00:43:06.430 --> 00:43:06.440 align:start position:0%
again an i AP team should never be
 
00:43:09.390 --> 00:43:09.400 align:start position:0%
basing placement on funding for a
 
00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
category the placement decision and
 
00:43:13.230 --> 00:43:13.240 align:start position:0%
what's needed should happen first and
 
00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
then those things kind of get plugged
 
00:43:17.190 --> 00:43:17.200 align:start position:0%
into a system which says oh by the way
 
00:43:19.549 --> 00:43:19.559 align:start position:0%
based on what was decided where does the
 
00:43:22.990 --> 00:43:23.000 align:start position:0%
student fall um but it but people are
 
00:43:25.030 --> 00:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
imperfect right so I do understand the
 
00:43:28.950 --> 00:43:28.960 align:start position:0%
concerns about perverse incentives um I
 
00:43:30.750 --> 00:43:30.760 align:start position:0%
took a look at you know many of the
 
00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:32.720 align:start position:0%
cases that have come to our office for
 
00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:35.200 align:start position:0%
students who are you know but
 
00:43:36.390 --> 00:43:36.400 align:start position:0%
definitionally when I look at the
 
00:43:38.390 --> 00:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
service delivery grids in their
 
00:43:41.349 --> 00:43:41.359 align:start position:0%
IEPs in one category where
 
00:43:44.790 --> 00:43:44.800 align:start position:0%
80% um or more of their time is in gened
 
00:43:46.870 --> 00:43:46.880 align:start position:0%
less than 80% of their time is or
 
00:43:48.349 --> 00:43:48.359 align:start position:0%
they're in an
 
00:43:50.230 --> 00:43:50.240 align:start position:0%
outplacement and what I would tell you
 
00:43:52.589 --> 00:43:52.599 align:start position:0%
is you know looking at several of those
 
00:43:56.309 --> 00:43:56.319 align:start position:0%
even on a a very conservative basis in
 
00:43:58.750 --> 00:43:58.760 align:start position:0%
terms of what the costs probably are to
 
00:44:01.549 --> 00:44:01.559 align:start position:0%
Providers um you know I did some numbers
 
00:44:03.630 --> 00:44:03.640 align:start position:0%
that I'm going to submit as kind of a
 
00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
sample in terms of written testimony um
 
00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:15.990 --> 00:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
receiving six hours a week of
 
00:44:17.790 --> 00:44:17.800 align:start position:0%
specialized direct instruction who was
 
00:44:19.710 --> 00:44:19.720 align:start position:0%
very much in an inclusion setting maybe
 
00:44:22.549 --> 00:44:22.559 align:start position:0%
had some Paris support Etc could easily
 
00:44:25.549 --> 00:44:25.559 align:start position:0%
be costing school districts $10,000
 
00:44:27.790 --> 00:44:27.800 align:start position:0%
above uh a Genet
 
00:44:29.990 --> 00:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
um based on the number of weeks in a
 
00:44:32.109 --> 00:44:32.119 align:start position:0%
year and and the cost of those providers
 
00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:34.240 align:start position:0%
doing those Services students out of the
 
00:44:37.069 --> 00:44:37.079 align:start position:0%
classroom for 40% of their time
 
00:44:38.790 --> 00:44:38.800 align:start position:0%
significantly above that you do approach
 
00:44:41.349 --> 00:44:41.359 align:start position:0%
levels that are more like 30,000 above
 
00:44:43.750 --> 00:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
and it shouldn't feel like a black box
 
00:44:46.109 --> 00:44:46.119 align:start position:0%
um you know looking you can look at an
 
00:44:48.910 --> 00:44:48.920 align:start position:0%
IEP Service delivery grid and I kind of
 
00:44:50.829 --> 00:44:50.839 align:start position:0%
did one and again May submit it in
 
00:44:53.190 --> 00:44:53.200 align:start position:0%
written testimony and look at you know
 
00:44:55.589 --> 00:44:55.599 align:start position:0%
what's typical for those services and
 
00:44:57.470 --> 00:44:57.480 align:start position:0%
how much do they cost so I would really
 
00:44:58.950 --> 00:44:58.960 align:start position:0%
encourage the committee to think about
 
00:45:01.470 --> 00:45:01.480 align:start position:0%
whether or not we separate
 
00:45:03.270 --> 00:45:03.280 align:start position:0%
categories you know with a lot of
 
00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:06.400 align:start position:0%
training to our IEP team members and
 
00:45:08.990 --> 00:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
case managers and leas of what the right
 
00:45:09.910 --> 00:45:09.920 align:start position:0%
way you know that you're looking at
 
00:45:12.349 --> 00:45:12.359 align:start position:0%
Services first you're never looking at a
 
00:45:15.910 --> 00:45:15.920 align:start position:0%
category in an IP team meeting um but
 
00:45:17.150 --> 00:45:17.160 align:start position:0%
whether or not we we do that in
 
00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:18.640 align:start position:0%
categories because it comports with some
 
00:45:21.950 --> 00:45:21.960 align:start position:0%
federal reporting requirements and it's
 
00:45:23.589 --> 00:45:23.599 align:start position:0%
a little off from our placement
 
00:45:25.470 --> 00:45:25.480 align:start position:0%
Continuum in the state which something
 
00:45:28.349 --> 00:45:28.359 align:start position:0%
I've discussed a bit with doe because I
 
00:45:30.910 --> 00:45:30.920 align:start position:0%
think from a Data Tracking perspective
 
00:45:33.950 --> 00:45:33.960 align:start position:0%
that presents some problems but but it
 
00:45:36.069 --> 00:45:36.079 align:start position:0%
it somewhat matches a a least
 
00:45:37.670 --> 00:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
restrictive environment placement
 
00:45:41.190 --> 00:45:41.200 align:start position:0%
Continuum that is in the guidelines um
 
00:45:44.150 --> 00:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
or whether it's just a per student with
 
00:45:47.230 --> 00:45:47.240 align:start position:0%
special education needs adequacy support
 
00:45:49.549 --> 00:45:49.559 align:start position:0%
I I do think the dollars are much lower
 
00:45:53.230 --> 00:45:53.240 align:start position:0%
than reality in here and I worry
 
00:45:55.829 --> 00:45:55.839 align:start position:0%
that that creates more divisive
 
00:45:58.710 --> 00:45:58.720 align:start position:0%
environment because then schools are you
 
00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:00.400 align:start position:0%
know they're required to provide these
 
00:46:03.069 --> 00:46:03.079 align:start position:0%
Services legally they're going to end up
 
00:46:05.829 --> 00:46:05.839 align:start position:0%
having to pull funds from general
 
00:46:08.349 --> 00:46:08.359 align:start position:0%
education be if we're not coming close
 
00:46:10.710 --> 00:46:10.720 align:start position:0%
to the actual costs right now of
 
00:46:12.950 --> 00:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
providing special education support and
 
00:46:16.390 --> 00:46:16.400 align:start position:0%
so it really creates friction um that is
 
00:46:19.589 --> 00:46:19.599 align:start position:0%
very much on the mind of our local Ed
 
00:46:21.549 --> 00:46:21.559 align:start position:0%
agency Representatives it shouldn't be
 
00:46:24.030 --> 00:46:24.040 align:start position:0%
they they reluctantly admit considering
 
00:46:28.790 --> 00:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
costs but they're Under Fire then
 
00:46:30.790 --> 00:46:30.800 align:start position:0%
from you know everyone else in the
 
00:46:32.510 --> 00:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
school who
 
00:46:35.230 --> 00:46:35.240 align:start position:0%
says the funds have to come from J head
 
00:46:37.510 --> 00:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
if we're not providing adequate um
 
00:46:38.990 --> 00:46:39.000 align:start position:0%
funding for special education and
 
00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
therefore you see um real Division and
 
00:46:43.030 --> 00:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
that that would be something that I
 
00:46:46.190 --> 00:46:46.200 align:start position:0%
would hope we could start tackling with
 
00:46:48.510 --> 00:46:48.520 align:start position:0%
that I would take questions thank you
 
00:46:50.510 --> 00:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
and you said you have a written
 
00:46:53.309 --> 00:46:53.319 align:start position:0%
submission um I it's it not fully right
 
00:46:55.430 --> 00:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
now I have um kind of some samples of
 
00:46:57.510 --> 00:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
what I did of like a a sample category A
 
00:46:59.750 --> 00:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
and B with some cost pieces so you can
 
00:47:02.950 --> 00:47:02.960 align:start position:0%
submit that uh after the hearing but uh
 
00:47:04.270 --> 00:47:04.280 align:start position:0%
be aware that we're having a work
 
00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:06.160 align:start position:0%
session tomorrow morning anything you
 
00:47:09.390 --> 00:47:09.400 align:start position:0%
can produce today sure would be helpful
 
00:47:11.109 --> 00:47:11.119 align:start position:0%
uh questions from the
 
00:47:13.750 --> 00:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
committee representative fellows thank
 
00:47:16.470 --> 00:47:16.480 align:start position:0%
you um I know you're fairly I know your
 
00:47:19.150 --> 00:47:19.160 align:start position:0%
position is fairly new so you can't have
 
00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:23.200 align:start position:0%
been in it very long can um you give us
 
00:47:27.349 --> 00:47:27.359 align:start position:0%
some sense of what it is when you see
 
00:47:29.870 --> 00:47:29.880 align:start position:0%
you you're dealing with appeals I
 
00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:32.640 align:start position:0%
believe of or when there's a
 
00:47:34.430 --> 00:47:34.440 align:start position:0%
disagreement between the district and
 
00:47:38.390 --> 00:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
the parent and and how that might have
 
00:47:42.390 --> 00:47:42.400 align:start position:0%
inform us about um
 
00:47:45.630 --> 00:47:45.640 align:start position:0%
cost because it could be
 
00:47:48.150 --> 00:47:48.160 align:start position:0%
connected sure um I'm going to have to
 
00:47:49.750 --> 00:47:49.760 align:start position:0%
do a little bit of interpreting of the
 
00:47:50.870 --> 00:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
question and you tell me if I'm
 
00:47:54.510 --> 00:47:54.520 align:start position:0%
interpreting it wrong position wise um
 
00:47:56.950 --> 00:47:56.960 align:start position:0%
the office has a very broad mandate um
 
00:47:59.430 --> 00:47:59.440 align:start position:0%
um we are getting a lot of requests for
 
00:48:02.710 --> 00:48:02.720 align:start position:0%
individual help um for families probably
 
00:48:06.630 --> 00:48:06.640 align:start position:0%
about 40 or 50 a month um which is Way
 
00:48:08.549 --> 00:48:08.559 align:start position:0%
Beyond what we have the Staffing to
 
00:48:11.750 --> 00:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
accommodate but working quite a bit um
 
00:48:15.589 --> 00:48:15.599 align:start position:0%
yes once there's a dispute uh looking at
 
00:48:18.349 --> 00:48:18.359 align:start position:0%
a lot of students who have more service
 
00:48:21.270 --> 00:48:21.280 align:start position:0%
needs than is typical so our office does
 
00:48:24.230 --> 00:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
generally see students who are um
 
00:48:25.829 --> 00:48:25.839 align:start position:0%
probably higher cost special education
 
00:48:29.109 --> 00:48:29.119 align:start position:0%
students but you know that doesn't
 
00:48:31.870 --> 00:48:31.880 align:start position:0%
affect perspective on what you know the
 
00:48:33.710 --> 00:48:33.720 align:start position:0%
the 25,000 students or so that we have
 
00:48:35.829 --> 00:48:35.839 align:start position:0%
who are in the category a you know we
 
00:48:39.230 --> 00:48:39.240 align:start position:0%
certainly see some of those um does the
 
00:48:41.470 --> 00:48:41.480 align:start position:0%
appeal process or the dispute process
 
00:48:44.670 --> 00:48:44.680 align:start position:0%
add to cost as I think
 
00:48:50.549 --> 00:48:50.559 align:start position:0%
no no I'm I'm asking if if um the
 
00:48:53.470 --> 00:48:53.480 align:start position:0%
disputes when you look at let's see I
 
00:48:54.670 --> 00:48:54.680 align:start position:0%
guess I don't know exactly what you're
 
00:48:57.710 --> 00:48:57.720 align:start position:0%
doing but when you look at a particular
 
00:49:00.630 --> 00:49:00.640 align:start position:0%
case you're looking at what the district
 
00:49:03.870 --> 00:49:03.880 align:start position:0%
thinks and what the parents think and if
 
00:49:07.069 --> 00:49:07.079 align:start position:0%
there's some oh sometimes sometimes you
 
00:49:09.990 --> 00:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
hear that parents push to get more
 
00:49:13.190 --> 00:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
services for their students maybe beyond
 
00:49:15.510 --> 00:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
what they the district thinks they need
 
00:49:19.109 --> 00:49:19.119 align:start position:0%
is that common and when you look at the
 
00:49:22.270 --> 00:49:22.280 align:start position:0%
cases are the is it legitimate what the
 
00:49:24.549 --> 00:49:24.559 align:start position:0%
you what the parents are asking for it
 
00:49:28.910 --> 00:49:28.920 align:start position:0%
because it all impacts cost yeah yes so
 
00:49:30.910 --> 00:49:30.920 align:start position:0%
um two
 
00:49:30.920 --> 00:49:33.349 align:start position:0%
um two
answers

00:49:33.349 --> 00:49:33.359 align:start position:0%
answers
 
00:49:38.510 --> 00:49:38.520 align:start position:0%
uh yes I would say any of the cases that
 
00:49:41.470 --> 00:49:41.480 align:start position:0%
come to our office I would say it is
 
00:49:42.870 --> 00:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
legitimate what the parents are looking
 
00:49:46.870 --> 00:49:46.880 align:start position:0%
for it doesn't always impact cost
 
00:49:50.789 --> 00:49:50.799 align:start position:0%
dramatically um as Miss Dunham made the
 
00:49:54.069 --> 00:49:54.079 align:start position:0%
point sometimes uh we actually do have
 
00:49:55.750 --> 00:49:55.760 align:start position:0%
parents who are looking for less
 
00:49:59.150 --> 00:49:59.160 align:start position:0%
restrictive environment ments not more
 
00:50:01.870 --> 00:50:01.880 align:start position:0%
um and schools have found their student
 
00:50:04.470 --> 00:50:04.480 align:start position:0%
easier to handle or push into a more
 
00:50:07.230 --> 00:50:07.240 align:start position:0%
restrictive environment
 
00:50:09.470 --> 00:50:09.480 align:start position:0%
um but it might mean that more services
 
00:50:10.870 --> 00:50:10.880 align:start position:0%
are needed in the less restrictive
 
00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
environment so so or or it might mean
 
00:50:15.069 --> 00:50:15.079 align:start position:0%
that the parent is really just concerned
 
00:50:17.069 --> 00:50:17.079 align:start position:0%
that we're not seeing progress towards
 
00:50:20.589 --> 00:50:20.599 align:start position:0%
goals or that Services aren't being
 
00:50:23.349 --> 00:50:23.359 align:start position:0%
delivered Faithfully or in the way that
 
00:50:25.549 --> 00:50:25.559 align:start position:0%
um or effectively uh so we deal with a
 
00:50:28.190 --> 00:50:28.200 align:start position:0%
lot of those cases um for parents
 
00:50:30.390 --> 00:50:30.400 align:start position:0%
seeking out placements yes it would
 
00:50:34.789 --> 00:50:34.799 align:start position:0%
increase cost most likely but in a large
 
00:50:37.390 --> 00:50:37.400 align:start position:0%
large large number of those cases um and
 
00:50:39.589 --> 00:50:39.599 align:start position:0%
they are ones we've been uh I've been
 
00:50:42.069 --> 00:50:42.079 align:start position:0%
triaging for about a year and a half of
 
00:50:43.829 --> 00:50:43.839 align:start position:0%
students who are completely out of
 
00:50:46.510 --> 00:50:46.520 align:start position:0%
school because there is a dispute over
 
00:50:48.270 --> 00:50:48.280 align:start position:0%
placement and the schools can't handle
 
00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:48.990 align:start position:0%
placement and the schools can't handle
the

00:50:48.990 --> 00:50:49.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:50:51.549 --> 00:50:51.559 align:start position:0%
student in the environment they're in
 
00:50:53.390 --> 00:50:53.400 align:start position:0%
but they haven't determined a placement
 
00:50:55.710 --> 00:50:55.720 align:start position:0%
situation so I would say again it's not
 
00:50:57.230 --> 00:50:57.240 align:start position:0%
an increase of cost it's just we're not
 
00:50:59.150 --> 00:50:59.160 align:start position:0%
doing the right thing right because we
 
00:51:02.150 --> 00:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
have a student who's sitting nowhere um
 
00:51:03.430 --> 00:51:03.440 align:start position:0%
sometimes when those cases come to my
 
00:51:05.430 --> 00:51:05.440 align:start position:0%
office and it's more than any of us I
 
00:51:07.710 --> 00:51:07.720 align:start position:0%
think would be comfortable thinking so I
 
00:51:09.829 --> 00:51:09.839 align:start position:0%
would not say that it is so much an
 
00:51:12.390 --> 00:51:12.400 align:start position:0%
increase in cost I think I'm looking at
 
00:51:15.510 --> 00:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
a reality of you know what school
 
00:51:19.390 --> 00:51:19.400 align:start position:0%
administrators would really say to break
 
00:51:22.069 --> 00:51:22.079 align:start position:0%
down the what people seem to think is a
 
00:51:24.549 --> 00:51:24.559 align:start position:0%
black box of special education costs if
 
00:51:27.069 --> 00:51:27.079 align:start position:0%
you break it down by the provids you
 
00:51:28.990 --> 00:51:29.000 align:start position:0%
know the
 
00:51:31.589 --> 00:51:31.599 align:start position:0%
services and I would like to see us
 
00:51:32.910 --> 00:51:32.920 align:start position:0%
doing more of that because it really
 
00:51:34.750 --> 00:51:34.760 align:start position:0%
should be treated as an investment you
 
00:51:37.670 --> 00:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
know when Ida was passed I don't think
 
00:51:40.750 --> 00:51:40.760 align:start position:0%
it was just a
 
00:51:44.230 --> 00:51:44.240 align:start position:0%
dignity bill I think it was also if we
 
00:51:46.870 --> 00:51:46.880 align:start position:0%
don't invest properly in our students
 
00:51:49.470 --> 00:51:49.480 align:start position:0%
education we end up with problems down
 
00:51:53.349 --> 00:51:53.359 align:start position:0%
the road um so with most of our students
 
00:51:55.589 --> 00:51:55.599 align:start position:0%
who are in special education they are in
 
00:51:58.349 --> 00:51:58.359 align:start position:0%
you know 25,000 of the 30,000 in New
 
00:52:00.270 --> 00:52:00.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are in regular classrooms most
 
00:52:01.829 --> 00:52:01.839 align:start position:0%
of the time they're just getting some
 
00:52:04.109 --> 00:52:04.119 align:start position:0%
additional services and the idea would
 
00:52:06.950 --> 00:52:06.960 align:start position:0%
be that would just get them to the point
 
00:52:08.309 --> 00:52:08.319 align:start position:0%
where they are
 
00:52:10.430 --> 00:52:10.440 align:start position:0%
productive members of society in the
 
00:52:13.230 --> 00:52:13.240 align:start position:0%
same way as any of our other students
 
00:52:17.309 --> 00:52:17.319 align:start position:0%
graduating thank you any other
 
00:52:22.710 --> 00:52:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:26.750 --> 00:52:26.760 align:start position:0%
Ames good morning U morning
 
00:52:29.030 --> 00:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
I used to uh I was in the trenches for
 
00:52:31.109 --> 00:52:31.119 align:start position:0%
many years as an attorney
 
00:52:34.589 --> 00:52:34.599 align:start position:0%
representing uh Children and Families uh
 
00:52:38.309 --> 00:52:38.319 align:start position:0%
coping with special needs and uh in my
 
00:52:41.430 --> 00:52:41.440 align:start position:0%
experience I'm asking you um if it's
 
00:52:46.030 --> 00:52:46.040 align:start position:0%
yours too um was that the issue always
 
00:52:49.589 --> 00:52:49.599 align:start position:0%
was whether more costly Services were
 
00:52:52.750 --> 00:52:52.760 align:start position:0%
needed by this child not and and
 
00:52:54.470 --> 00:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
sometimes it was where those Services
 
00:52:58.430 --> 00:52:58.440 align:start position:0%
would be provided but um that was the
 
00:53:00.750 --> 00:53:00.760 align:start position:0%
that was the nature of the fight and
 
00:53:03.150 --> 00:53:03.160 align:start position:0%
there were it was also often in
 
00:53:05.670 --> 00:53:05.680 align:start position:0%
expensive and drawn out fight fight so
 
00:53:09.750 --> 00:53:09.760 align:start position:0%
my first question is is is is that the
 
00:53:15.309 --> 00:53:15.319 align:start position:0%
reality that's out there um and how does
 
00:53:17.750 --> 00:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
that reality relate to what the state
 
00:53:19.630 --> 00:53:19.640 align:start position:0%
does or does not provide as a
 
00:53:24.990 --> 00:53:25.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:27.230 --> 00:53:27.240 align:start position:0%
District so I would say and I will try
 
00:53:29.430 --> 00:53:29.440 align:start position:0%
to get written testimony on on just some
 
00:53:32.030 --> 00:53:32.040 align:start position:0%
samples in today for this but I I would
 
00:53:33.789 --> 00:53:33.799 align:start position:0%
say the numbers that we're talking about
 
00:53:38.430 --> 00:53:38.440 align:start position:0%
in this bill in terms of costs for
 
00:53:40.870 --> 00:53:40.880 align:start position:0%
special ed services in in categories in
 
00:53:42.589 --> 00:53:42.599 align:start position:0%
terms of how much service students are
 
00:53:44.910 --> 00:53:44.920 align:start position:0%
getting are radically lower than
 
00:53:48.829 --> 00:53:48.839 align:start position:0%
reality radically lower um and that
 
00:53:52.589 --> 00:53:52.599 align:start position:0%
reality is yes if you asked me Are we
 
00:53:54.390 --> 00:53:54.400 align:start position:0%
more often than not in my office pushing
 
00:53:57.349 --> 00:53:57.359 align:start position:0%
for more services yes more often than
 
00:54:02.349 --> 00:54:02.359 align:start position:0%
not by no means always um but
 
00:54:04.950 --> 00:54:04.960 align:start position:0%
again you know we don't we're so busy we
 
00:54:06.430 --> 00:54:06.440 align:start position:0%
don't take cases that we don't fully
 
00:54:08.630 --> 00:54:08.640 align:start position:0%
believe in you know in my office in
 
00:54:11.270 --> 00:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
terms of what the students actually need
 
00:54:14.510 --> 00:54:14.520 align:start position:0%
um and meeting requirements and if we're
 
00:54:16.190 --> 00:54:16.200 align:start position:0%
pushing for those Services it's on the
 
00:54:18.829 --> 00:54:18.839 align:start position:0%
basis of actually having analyzed over
 
00:54:20.589 --> 00:54:20.599 align:start position:0%
the past three years did the student
 
00:54:23.230 --> 00:54:23.240 align:start position:0%
make any progress on their goals how far
 
00:54:28.309 --> 00:54:28.319 align:start position:0%
behind are they Visa a typically um
 
00:54:29.870 --> 00:54:29.880 align:start position:0%
developing student without any
 
00:54:29.880 --> 00:54:31.510 align:start position:0%
developing student without any
identified

00:54:31.510 --> 00:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
identified
 
00:54:34.190 --> 00:54:34.200 align:start position:0%
disability uh and if it's multiple years
 
00:54:37.549 --> 00:54:37.559 align:start position:0%
then again I go back to the logic of
 
00:54:39.510 --> 00:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
that's not doing anyone that's not doing
 
00:54:41.589 --> 00:54:41.599 align:start position:0%
Society any good either right if we're
 
00:54:44.430 --> 00:54:44.440 align:start position:0%
if we're not assisting students
 
00:54:46.950 --> 00:54:46.960 align:start position:0%
with um coming up to the standards of
 
00:54:48.109 --> 00:54:48.119 align:start position:0%
the curriculum and getting that
 
00:54:49.829 --> 00:54:49.839 align:start position:0%
education that's what the idea of access
 
00:54:51.510 --> 00:54:51.520 align:start position:0%
to a public education in the
 
00:54:54.789 --> 00:54:54.799 align:start position:0%
disabilities laws are so I would say yes
 
00:54:57.270 --> 00:54:57.280 align:start position:0%
it's cost spent now
 
00:55:00.349 --> 00:55:00.359 align:start position:0%
but again we're looking at the only way
 
00:55:02.030 --> 00:55:02.040 align:start position:0%
we support parents in pushing those
 
00:55:03.910 --> 00:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
costs is when their students have made
 
00:55:06.230 --> 00:55:06.240 align:start position:0%
really no progress and something has to
 
00:55:09.190 --> 00:55:09.200 align:start position:0%
be done to get them further
 
00:55:11.549 --> 00:55:11.559 align:start position:0%
along representative
 
00:55:15.750 --> 00:55:15.760 align:start position:0%
Burton oh pardon yes representative turn
 
00:55:20.390 --> 00:55:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:24.549 --> 00:55:24.559 align:start position:0%
um this bill I think is uh is searching
 
00:55:27.029 --> 00:55:27.039 align:start position:0%
for a better way of
 
00:55:29.029 --> 00:55:29.039 align:start position:0%
uh providing differentiated aid for
 
00:55:31.870 --> 00:55:31.880 align:start position:0%
special needs children than the one size
 
00:55:34.910 --> 00:55:34.920 align:start position:0%
fits all or maybe it's two sizes one
 
00:55:37.630 --> 00:55:37.640 align:start position:0%
size is everybody
 
00:55:42.510 --> 00:55:42.520 align:start position:0%
except 700 or so um students that are in
 
00:55:46.430 --> 00:55:46.440 align:start position:0%
the very high end which
 
00:55:49.829 --> 00:55:49.839 align:start position:0%
uh historically was were referred to as
 
00:55:51.390 --> 00:55:51.400 align:start position:0%
the catastrophic
 
00:55:58.109 --> 00:55:58.119 align:start position:0%
Aid um uh students and um and so uh
 
00:56:02.870 --> 00:56:02.880 align:start position:0%
we're searching for sort of a a way to
 
00:56:06.069 --> 00:56:06.079 align:start position:0%
break out that one size for everybody
 
00:56:10.510 --> 00:56:10.520 align:start position:0%
else um and what's the SI the breakout
 
00:56:13.589 --> 00:56:13.599 align:start position:0%
here is based on
 
00:56:17.950 --> 00:56:17.960 align:start position:0%
time in uh inside a regular
 
00:56:21.230 --> 00:56:21.240 align:start position:0%
class um
 
00:56:24.589 --> 00:56:24.599 align:start position:0%
or yeah inside or not inside the regular
 
00:56:27.789 --> 00:56:27.799 align:start position:0%
class and then in special in a separate
 
00:56:30.630 --> 00:56:30.640 align:start position:0%
school um is there and I think what
 
00:56:32.349 --> 00:56:32.359 align:start position:0%
you're saying you've got some data
 
00:56:34.630 --> 00:56:34.640 align:start position:0%
you've been looking at this and maybe
 
00:56:38.270 --> 00:56:38.280 align:start position:0%
there's a better way of uh of dividing
 
00:56:40.829 --> 00:56:40.839 align:start position:0%
this and uh I think that's what we need
 
00:56:43.230 --> 00:56:43.240 align:start position:0%
help on if there is a better way I think
 
00:56:46.309 --> 00:56:46.319 align:start position:0%
everybody wants a better way I think I
 
00:56:47.990 --> 00:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
would say that you know when I analyzed
 
00:56:51.549 --> 00:56:51.559 align:start position:0%
it I sort of accepted the definitions
 
00:56:53.750 --> 00:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
for the categories again as I understand
 
00:56:56.270 --> 00:56:56.280 align:start position:0%
that this is a way in which doe is
 
00:56:58.510 --> 00:56:58.520 align:start position:0%
reporting out um and required to report
 
00:57:01.510 --> 00:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
out uh data so that's how they've
 
00:57:03.710 --> 00:57:03.720 align:start position:0%
compiled numbers um I know doe has
 
00:57:05.069 --> 00:57:05.079 align:start position:0%
numbers of students in each category
 
00:57:08.829 --> 00:57:08.839 align:start position:0%
it's approximately 25,000 in a 4500 in B
 
00:57:10.029 --> 00:57:10.039 align:start position:0%
which is the vast majority of your
 
00:57:11.430 --> 00:57:11.440 align:start position:0%
special ed population and I know you
 
00:57:13.069 --> 00:57:13.079 align:start position:0%
referred to 700 I've seen numbers that
 
00:57:17.589 --> 00:57:17.599 align:start position:0%
are actually under 500 for that um
 
00:57:19.589 --> 00:57:19.599 align:start position:0%
strongest disability group of students
 
00:57:21.270 --> 00:57:21.280 align:start position:0%
so even that is though that is a very
 
00:57:24.230 --> 00:57:24.240 align:start position:0%
high cost group that's not going to have
 
00:57:26.349 --> 00:57:26.359 align:start position:0%
as much impact on the budget because the
 
00:57:29.150 --> 00:57:29.160 align:start position:0%
numbers are so low as the you know as
 
00:57:31.710 --> 00:57:31.720 align:start position:0%
the students who are not outplaced right
 
00:57:34.870 --> 00:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
who are in our Public Schools um whether
 
00:57:37.589 --> 00:57:37.599 align:start position:0%
there's a better way you know it
 
00:57:40.630 --> 00:57:40.640 align:start position:0%
really I'm I don't have an opinion on
 
00:57:42.270 --> 00:57:42.280 align:start position:0%
whether there is a better way than a
 
00:57:45.069 --> 00:57:45.079 align:start position:0%
category a category B um I would just
 
00:57:48.109 --> 00:57:48.119 align:start position:0%
like us to look at the reality of
 
00:57:51.270 --> 00:57:51.280 align:start position:0%
typical Services being provided and what
 
00:57:54.789 --> 00:57:54.799 align:start position:0%
they cost to students with relatively
 
00:57:56.750 --> 00:57:56.760 align:start position:0%
minimal Services if you look at
 
00:57:59.910 --> 00:57:59.920 align:start position:0%
hours um that they would might be pulled
 
00:58:01.710 --> 00:58:01.720 align:start position:0%
out for a service versus in their
 
00:58:04.910 --> 00:58:04.920 align:start position:0%
regular classroom um and those with
 
00:58:06.710 --> 00:58:06.720 align:start position:0%
slightly more because even the category
 
00:58:10.670 --> 00:58:10.680 align:start position:0%
B definition here um is not it's it's
 
00:58:12.750 --> 00:58:12.760 align:start position:0%
more than 80% that's a there's a very
 
00:58:14.710 --> 00:58:14.720 align:start position:0%
wide group in category B in this
 
00:58:14.720 --> 00:58:16.470 align:start position:0%
wide group in category B in this
definition

00:58:16.470 --> 00:58:16.480 align:start position:0%
definition
 
00:58:20.190 --> 00:58:20.200 align:start position:0%
um so it it probably would
 
00:58:22.950 --> 00:58:22.960 align:start position:0%
include students who are just receiving
 
00:58:26.150 --> 00:58:26.160 align:start position:0%
a little bit more time in service but in
 
00:58:28.270 --> 00:58:28.280 align:start position:0%
the regular Ed classroom and students
 
00:58:30.750 --> 00:58:30.760 align:start position:0%
who are in our Public
 
00:58:34.069 --> 00:58:34.079 align:start position:0%
School separate classrooms um because
 
00:58:35.510 --> 00:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
the category C is really talking about
 
00:58:37.549 --> 00:58:37.559 align:start position:0%
out placements if we read the
 
00:58:40.910 --> 00:58:40.920 align:start position:0%
definition um so do I think there's a
 
00:58:44.430 --> 00:58:44.440 align:start position:0%
better way I think that I would say
 
00:58:46.950 --> 00:58:46.960 align:start position:0%
there is a human concern with perverse
 
00:58:48.950 --> 00:58:48.960 align:start position:0%
incentives if it is just you know if you
 
00:58:50.309 --> 00:58:50.319 align:start position:0%
pull the student out more you're going
 
00:58:52.950 --> 00:58:52.960 align:start position:0%
to get more funding do I think in re in
 
00:58:54.870 --> 00:58:54.880 align:start position:0%
reality that that will have as much of
 
00:58:56.670 --> 00:58:56.680 align:start position:0%
an impact as as perhaps those who
 
00:58:59.309 --> 00:58:59.319 align:start position:0%
testified previously not if the dollar
 
00:59:01.349 --> 00:59:01.359 align:start position:0%
levels are left where they are right now
 
00:59:03.910 --> 00:59:03.920 align:start position:0%
because to be honest with you they they
 
00:59:06.789 --> 00:59:06.799 align:start position:0%
don't you know for someone to then put
 
00:59:08.390 --> 00:59:08.400 align:start position:0%
someone in the category where they're
 
00:59:11.630 --> 00:59:11.640 align:start position:0%
receiving more than more services than
 
00:59:14.549 --> 00:59:14.559 align:start position:0%
the 80% of their time in the regular Ed
 
00:59:16.150 --> 00:59:16.160 align:start position:0%
we're not even beginning to cover the
 
00:59:18.230 --> 00:59:18.240 align:start position:0%
cost of that with these dollars so I'm
 
00:59:19.870 --> 00:59:19.880 align:start position:0%
not sure that at these dollar levels
 
00:59:21.430 --> 00:59:21.440 align:start position:0%
you'd have the perverse incentives
 
00:59:23.670 --> 00:59:23.680 align:start position:0%
because the the cost differentiation
 
00:59:24.990 --> 00:59:25.000 align:start position:0%
they really they wouldn't be making
 
00:59:26.990 --> 00:59:27.000 align:start position:0%
money on placing a student in a
 
00:59:28.750 --> 00:59:28.760 align:start position:0%
different category because they'd have
 
00:59:32.069 --> 00:59:32.079 align:start position:0%
to be providing those additional
 
00:59:34.349 --> 00:59:34.359 align:start position:0%
Services thank you that that last
 
00:59:36.510 --> 00:59:36.520 align:start position:0%
Insight was important uh representative
 
00:59:38.630 --> 00:59:38.640 align:start position:0%
Burton uh thank you very much Mr
 
00:59:40.430 --> 00:59:40.440 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
00:59:43.510 --> 00:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
question um 40 years ago I sat in this
 
00:59:46.190 --> 00:59:46.200 align:start position:0%
room as we wrote the special ed law for
 
00:59:48.910 --> 00:59:48.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I co-chaired the
 
00:59:51.230 --> 00:59:51.240 align:start position:0%
committee um because New Hampshire had
 
00:59:54.150 --> 00:59:54.160 align:start position:0%
sunsetted it out of existence they had I
 
00:59:56.829 --> 00:59:56.839 align:start position:0%
don't know if people knew that um and
 
00:59:59.390 --> 00:59:59.400 align:start position:0%
the question of disputed
 
01:00:03.029 --> 01:00:03.039 align:start position:0%
IEPs was a good one because often the
 
01:00:04.910 --> 01:00:04.920 align:start position:0%
this room would be full of lawyers not
 
01:00:07.270 --> 01:00:07.280 align:start position:0%
Educators and they would argue about
 
01:00:09.630 --> 01:00:09.640 align:start position:0%
costs not what was best for the children
 
01:00:12.470 --> 01:00:12.480 align:start position:0%
and I would call the parents aboc Center
 
01:00:14.510 --> 01:00:14.520 align:start position:0%
and said you better get over here
 
01:00:17.630 --> 01:00:17.640 align:start position:0%
quickly um my question is out of all of
 
01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:19.430 align:start position:0%
quickly um my question is out of all of
that

01:00:19.430 --> 01:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:00:21.829 --> 01:00:21.839 align:start position:0%
um I found out there must be a better
 
01:00:24.710 --> 01:00:24.720 align:start position:0%
way to settle IEPs than having the
 
01:00:27.470 --> 01:00:27.480 align:start position:0%
lawyer there and and Mrs Ellen and I did
 
01:00:30.950 --> 01:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
not get along very well um so I went to
 
01:00:32.630 --> 01:00:32.640 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and I
 
01:00:35.589 --> 01:00:35.599 align:start position:0%
attended um IEP session representative
 
01:00:37.510 --> 01:00:37.520 align:start position:0%
you're going to frame the question right
 
01:00:39.630 --> 01:00:39.640 align:start position:0%
there is a question at the end don't
 
01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:40.910 align:start position:0%
there is a question at the end don't
worry

01:00:40.910 --> 01:00:40.920 align:start position:0%
worry
 
01:00:46.270 --> 01:00:46.280 align:start position:0%
sir um so I put in the legislation uh
 
01:00:49.710 --> 01:00:49.720 align:start position:0%
mediation for on a trial basis for
 
01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:50.829 align:start position:0%
mediation for on a trial basis for
disputed

01:00:50.829 --> 01:00:50.839 align:start position:0%
disputed
 
01:00:54.309 --> 01:00:54.319 align:start position:0%
IEPs my questions sir is do you still
 
01:00:57.150 --> 01:00:57.160 align:start position:0%
have that process where can a parent
 
01:01:00.630 --> 01:01:00.640 align:start position:0%
reopen an IEP through a mediator if
 
01:01:04.589 --> 01:01:04.599 align:start position:0%
they're uh uh unhappy with the way the
 
01:01:08.829 --> 01:01:08.839 align:start position:0%
process is going yes absolutely and we
 
01:01:12.630 --> 01:01:12.640 align:start position:0%
support parents in going through those
 
01:01:16.029 --> 01:01:16.039 align:start position:0%
processes simple answer uh is it working
 
01:01:17.510 --> 01:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
you're asking now a question that
 
01:01:18.630 --> 01:01:18.640 align:start position:0%
probably goes beyond the scope of this
 
01:01:19.990 --> 01:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
bill to give you an honest answer so
 
01:01:21.990 --> 01:01:22.000 align:start position:0%
I'll try to do it in a very short time
 
01:01:24.710 --> 01:01:24.720 align:start position:0%
in my office I tend to but again we're
 
01:01:27.029 --> 01:01:27.039 align:start position:0%
not um
 
01:01:28.950 --> 01:01:28.960 align:start position:0%
I try to avoid getting to this stage in
 
01:01:30.630 --> 01:01:30.640 align:start position:0%
the first place by being active with the
 
01:01:32.950 --> 01:01:32.960 align:start position:0%
IEP team but I tend to file for due
 
01:01:34.549 --> 01:01:34.559 align:start position:0%
process and due mediation as a part of
 
01:01:36.910 --> 01:01:36.920 align:start position:0%
that because there is more of a stick at
 
01:01:38.750 --> 01:01:38.760 align:start position:0%
the end for actually getting a mediated
 
01:01:40.630 --> 01:01:40.640 align:start position:0%
result than if we just go to mediation
 
01:01:43.910 --> 01:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
where if we don't come to a result
 
01:01:46.549 --> 01:01:46.559 align:start position:0%
there's nothing immediate looming in 10
 
01:01:49.670 --> 01:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
days or 20 days um to
 
01:01:52.829 --> 01:01:52.839 align:start position:0%
Spur some sort of settlement but yes we
 
01:01:55.230 --> 01:01:55.240 align:start position:0%
settle a lot of cases in mediation with
 
01:01:56.390 --> 01:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
very different
 
01:01:58.230 --> 01:01:58.240 align:start position:0%
IEPs then we
 
01:02:00.710 --> 01:02:00.720 align:start position:0%
started okay any further
 
01:02:03.230 --> 01:02:03.240 align:start position:0%
questions oh representative
 
01:02:05.349 --> 01:02:05.359 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
01:02:07.069 --> 01:02:07.079 align:start position:0%
taking my question and I apologize if
 
01:02:08.870 --> 01:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
this was addressed before I was able to
 
01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:10.069 align:start position:0%
this was addressed before I was able to
be

01:02:10.069 --> 01:02:10.079 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:02:13.349 --> 01:02:13.359 align:start position:0%
here you remarked a moment ago that you
 
01:02:15.230 --> 01:02:15.240 align:start position:0%
didn't see the amount of difference in
 
01:02:17.750 --> 01:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
funding between the three categories as
 
01:02:19.910 --> 01:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
an incentive for districts to categorize
 
01:02:21.910 --> 01:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
a student differently than they
 
01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:23.789 align:start position:0%
a student differently than they
otherwise

01:02:23.789 --> 01:02:23.799 align:start position:0%
otherwise
 
01:02:26.910 --> 01:02:26.920 align:start position:0%
would and sort of reading between the
 
01:02:29.390 --> 01:02:29.400 align:start position:0%
lines of what you said would would you
 
01:02:31.829 --> 01:02:31.839 align:start position:0%
confirm if I'm correct here or
 
01:02:34.470 --> 01:02:34.480 align:start position:0%
not in for example
 
01:02:38.750 --> 01:02:38.760 align:start position:0%
category uh a does that additional
 
01:02:42.430 --> 01:02:42.440 align:start position:0%
2,185 actually cover in most cases the
 
01:02:44.510 --> 01:02:44.520 align:start position:0%
services that that student needs the
 
01:02:47.349 --> 01:02:47.359 align:start position:0%
additional Services beyond the basic
 
01:02:50.269 --> 01:02:50.279 align:start position:0%
formula or not and similarly for the
 
01:02:52.870 --> 01:02:52.880 align:start position:0%
other categories so I'm going out on a
 
01:02:54.309 --> 01:02:54.319 align:start position:0%
limb here and I have talked to many
 
01:02:55.750 --> 01:02:55.760 align:start position:0%
colleagues who do not want to testify on
 
01:02:58.470 --> 01:02:58.480 align:start position:0%
the Point as directly as I'm going to
 
01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:03.349 align:start position:0%
the Point as directly as I'm going to
absolutely

01:03:03.349 --> 01:03:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:06.910 --> 01:03:06.920 align:start position:0%
not I I think I think it's time to move
 
01:03:08.870 --> 01:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
along we have a couple more people to
 
01:03:13.029 --> 01:03:13.039 align:start position:0%
testify thank you very much thank
 
01:03:23.870 --> 01:03:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:26.190 --> 01:03:26.200 align:start position:0%
Al thank you very much I know running
 
01:03:29.069 --> 01:03:29.079 align:start position:0%
behind so I'll be as quick as possible
 
01:03:30.789 --> 01:03:30.799 align:start position:0%
um Mark bone I represent the town of
 
01:03:32.190 --> 01:03:32.200 align:start position:0%
beeping also was an elementary school
 
01:03:33.870 --> 01:03:33.880 align:start position:0%
principal for 20 years in the town of
 
01:03:36.789 --> 01:03:36.799 align:start position:0%
eing um I'm here in opposition to this
 
01:03:38.510 --> 01:03:38.520 align:start position:0%
bill simply because there's a couple of
 
01:03:40.549 --> 01:03:40.559 align:start position:0%
things it's going to tell a story that's
 
01:03:42.510 --> 01:03:42.520 align:start position:0%
all I want you to think about Martin
 
01:03:44.069 --> 01:03:44.079 align:start position:0%
that's a fictional name of a student
 
01:03:46.269 --> 01:03:46.279 align:start position:0%
that we had who came into our school
 
01:03:48.269 --> 01:03:48.279 align:start position:0%
that as as a principal I was very
 
01:03:49.630 --> 01:03:49.640 align:start position:0%
concerned about the disruption this
 
01:03:51.470 --> 01:03:51.480 align:start position:0%
child cause because of the multiple
 
01:03:53.950 --> 01:03:53.960 align:start position:0%
needs that he had we had a team working
 
01:03:57.109 --> 01:03:57.119 align:start position:0%
with him I with the voice of saying we
 
01:03:58.870 --> 01:03:58.880 align:start position:0%
probably need to place this child out I
 
01:04:01.190 --> 01:04:01.200 align:start position:0%
I would I would say I probably said that
 
01:04:03.630 --> 01:04:03.640 align:start position:0%
20 times uh in various IEP meetings that
 
01:04:06.510 --> 01:04:06.520 align:start position:0%
we had but gradually we had an excellent
 
01:04:09.109 --> 01:04:09.119 align:start position:0%
team at school so we had a student who
 
01:04:10.670 --> 01:04:10.680 align:start position:0%
pretty much would come into school start
 
01:04:13.870 --> 01:04:13.880 align:start position:0%
the day and then would be taken out and
 
01:04:16.069 --> 01:04:16.079 align:start position:0%
and would work out of classroom for most
 
01:04:19.670 --> 01:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
of the day probably 95 96% of the
 
01:04:22.230 --> 01:04:22.240 align:start position:0%
time by the time that child went from
 
01:04:24.670 --> 01:04:24.680 align:start position:0%
kindergarten and finished first grade
 
01:04:26.990 --> 01:04:27.000 align:start position:0%
that child was in the
 
01:04:29.630 --> 01:04:29.640 align:start position:0%
classroom 90% of the
 
01:04:32.710 --> 01:04:32.720 align:start position:0%
time but it wasn't linear and this
 
01:04:36.309 --> 01:04:36.319 align:start position:0%
arbitrary uh 20% 80% to me wouldn't fit
 
01:04:37.549 --> 01:04:37.559 align:start position:0%
very well particularly when you're
 
01:04:39.349 --> 01:04:39.359 align:start position:0%
talking talking about IEP teams and how
 
01:04:40.870 --> 01:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
they work is they work with the child
 
01:04:42.150 --> 01:04:42.160 align:start position:0%
they look at the child and the child's
 
01:04:44.630 --> 01:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
needs schools need to have adequate
 
01:04:47.470 --> 01:04:47.480 align:start position:0%
resources to be able to put students
 
01:04:49.789 --> 01:04:49.799 align:start position:0%
into classrooms that is the law the
 
01:04:52.029 --> 01:04:52.039 align:start position:0%
least restrictive environment so I'm
 
01:04:53.670 --> 01:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
going to say that this is arbitrary that
 
01:04:54.950 --> 01:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
we've already you already heard
 
01:04:57.150 --> 01:04:57.160 align:start position:0%
testimony and regards to the the amounts
 
01:04:59.430 --> 01:04:59.440 align:start position:0%
are are too low number one all across
 
01:05:01.309 --> 01:05:01.319 align:start position:0%
the board but this
 
01:05:03.710 --> 01:05:03.720 align:start position:0%
8020 uh you may have some numbers to say
 
01:05:05.910 --> 01:05:05.920 align:start position:0%
but I I just say in terms of operating
 
01:05:08.549 --> 01:05:08.559 align:start position:0%
for the individual child that is just
 
01:05:10.069 --> 01:05:10.079 align:start position:0%
not going to
 
01:05:11.990 --> 01:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
work thank
 
01:05:14.990 --> 01:05:15.000 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much yes
 
01:05:16.870 --> 01:05:16.880 align:start position:0%
representative Mr chair thank you I'm
 
01:05:18.430 --> 01:05:18.440 align:start position:0%
aware we are very late so I'll will be
 
01:05:20.910 --> 01:05:20.920 align:start position:0%
extremely brief do I understand your
 
01:05:23.109 --> 01:05:23.119 align:start position:0%
testimony correctly that you are
 
01:05:25.710 --> 01:05:25.720 align:start position:0%
opposing this increase in funding
 
01:05:28.670 --> 01:05:28.680 align:start position:0%
because it's not high enough right thank
 
01:05:32.950 --> 01:05:32.960 align:start position:0%
you that's one thing also the formula is
 
01:05:35.829 --> 01:05:35.839 align:start position:0%
also something that that concerns me as
 
01:05:38.630 --> 01:05:38.640 align:start position:0%
well right I I think there's an inherent
 
01:05:39.910 --> 01:05:39.920 align:start position:0%
difficulty anytime you're making
 
01:05:41.789 --> 01:05:41.799 align:start position:0%
differentiation where that line is going
 
01:05:44.950 --> 01:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
to be and just over just under uh this
 
01:05:47.309 --> 01:05:47.319 align:start position:0%
pervades so many different issues thank
 
01:05:50.829 --> 01:05:50.839 align:start position:0%
you but the reality is is that IEP teams
 
01:05:52.910 --> 01:05:52.920 align:start position:0%
need to work with a child and they have
 
01:05:54.710 --> 01:05:54.720 align:start position:0%
to be flexible and you have to have the
 
01:05:56.829 --> 01:05:56.839 align:start position:0%
resources to to be able to move children
 
01:05:59.510 --> 01:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
in and out within that so your variation
 
01:06:02.309 --> 01:06:02.319 align:start position:0%
keep that in mind can't put kids in
 
01:06:05.390 --> 01:06:05.400 align:start position:0%
boxes thanks understood ultimately of
 
01:06:07.549 --> 01:06:07.559 align:start position:0%
course the there's a pool of funds for
 
01:06:11.269 --> 01:06:11.279 align:start position:0%
districts to work with Okay uh David
 
01:06:20.789 --> 01:06:20.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:23.670 --> 01:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
witness good morning Mr chairman welcome
 
01:06:26.190 --> 01:06:26.200 align:start position:0%
how are you today good hi committee
 
01:06:28.349 --> 01:06:28.359 align:start position:0%
members I will just be brief on to the
 
01:06:30.750 --> 01:06:30.760 align:start position:0%
point of the formula and Reserve other
 
01:06:33.710 --> 01:06:33.720 align:start position:0%
comments for the next bill um if you do
 
01:06:37.670 --> 01:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
the math that's in available in the uh
 
01:06:39.670 --> 01:06:39.680 align:start position:0%
financial statement at the end you take
 
01:06:43.230 --> 01:06:43.240 align:start position:0%
the 23,000 students in category a
 
01:06:46.470 --> 01:06:46.480 align:start position:0%
multiply that by 2185 you take the 5,000
 
01:06:51.710 --> 01:06:51.720 align:start position:0%
in category B the 325 and C the 4408 in
 
01:06:55.190 --> 01:06:55.200 align:start position:0%
category D you get a total that would
 
01:06:59.230 --> 01:06:59.240 align:start position:0%
equal $79 million 50 of that is in
 
01:07:02.190 --> 01:07:02.200 align:start position:0%
category a and almost 10 more in D so
 
01:07:05.510 --> 01:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
most of the money would go to the lowest
 
01:07:07.990 --> 01:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
amount only 2 and A5 million would go to
 
01:07:10.069 --> 01:07:10.079 align:start position:0%
the category C but the point I want to
 
01:07:12.670 --> 01:07:12.680 align:start position:0%
make is this is right now in special ed
 
01:07:15.870 --> 01:07:15.880 align:start position:0%
if you look at it as a pizza pie 82% of
 
01:07:19.670 --> 01:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
the money is spent by the towns 7% from
 
01:07:21.150 --> 01:07:21.160 align:start position:0%
the federal government and the state of
 
01:07:24.269 --> 01:07:24.279 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire pays 11% if you adopt this
 
01:07:27.589 --> 01:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
bill the state percentage will go from
 
01:07:31.630 --> 01:07:31.640 align:start position:0%
11% to 12% so to answer representative
 
01:07:33.470 --> 01:07:33.480 align:start position:0%
Damon's question is would this bill
 
01:07:36.269 --> 01:07:36.279 align:start position:0%
cover the cost no we we would still be
 
01:07:38.309 --> 01:07:38.319 align:start position:0%
massively underfunding Special Ed we'll
 
01:07:41.950 --> 01:07:41.960 align:start position:0%
be going from 11% of the cost to 12% of
 
01:07:43.990 --> 01:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
the cost if you also do all those
 
01:07:45.470 --> 01:07:45.480 align:start position:0%
numbers and add them up and then divide
 
01:07:46.630 --> 01:07:46.640 align:start position:0%
by the
 
01:07:50.269 --> 01:07:50.279 align:start position:0%
32846 students you get an average of
 
01:07:52.910 --> 01:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
$248 so what if you if you're getting a
 
01:07:54.589 --> 01:07:54.599 align:start position:0%
lot of push back on the categories
 
01:07:56.230 --> 01:07:56.240 align:start position:0%
because they they don't accurately
 
01:07:58.789 --> 01:07:58.799 align:start position:0%
reflect the costs a lot of category a
 
01:08:00.789 --> 01:08:00.799 align:start position:0%
students cost more than category B
 
01:08:02.390 --> 01:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
students because they have a one-on-one
 
01:08:05.029 --> 01:08:05.039 align:start position:0%
PA with them all day so if you dispel
 
01:08:07.109 --> 01:08:07.119 align:start position:0%
with the categories and just say this
 
01:08:09.950 --> 01:08:09.960 align:start position:0%
bill gives us a chance to minimally
 
01:08:11.950 --> 01:08:11.960 align:start position:0%
increase special Aid funding you would
 
01:08:13.230 --> 01:08:13.240 align:start position:0%
go from a
 
01:08:16.430 --> 01:08:16.440 align:start position:0%
2185 to a 248 basically you'd be adding
 
01:08:19.470 --> 01:08:19.480 align:start position:0%
about $200 in differentiated Aid that's
 
01:08:21.309 --> 01:08:21.319 align:start position:0%
what this bill does the next bill says
 
01:08:23.430 --> 01:08:23.440 align:start position:0%
let's go all the way and pay 100% but
 
01:08:25.110 --> 01:08:25.120 align:start position:0%
this bill in if you cut through all the
 
01:08:26.950 --> 01:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
categor you're increasing the state
 
01:08:31.269 --> 01:08:31.279 align:start position:0%
share from 11% to 12% that's not enough
 
01:08:32.950 --> 01:08:32.960 align:start position:0%
it just doesn't get us anywhere near to
 
01:08:34.470 --> 01:08:34.480 align:start position:0%
solving the special ed problem so that's
 
01:08:36.749 --> 01:08:36.759 align:start position:0%
all I want to say on this Bill thank you
 
01:08:38.189 --> 01:08:38.199 align:start position:0%
thank you for that Insight I think it's
 
01:08:39.950 --> 01:08:39.960 align:start position:0%
an important thing to realize we're
 
01:08:41.950 --> 01:08:41.960 align:start position:0%
debating both the amounts as well as
 
01:08:44.510 --> 01:08:44.520 align:start position:0%
whether the categories are helpful right
 
01:08:45.669 --> 01:08:45.679 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
01:08:48.630 --> 01:08:48.640 align:start position:0%
committee very good okay so with that
 
01:08:53.309 --> 01:08:53.319 align:start position:0%
I'm going to uh close the hearing on HP
 
01:08:56.829 --> 01:08:56.839 align:start position:0%
563 and uh I think we received very you
 
01:09:03.309 --> 01:09:03.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:03.319 --> 01:09:04.910 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:09:04.910 --> 01:09:04.920 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:09:09.950 --> 01:09:09.960 align:start position:0%
okay the next bill up is HB 603 and uh
 
01:09:11.550 --> 01:09:11.560 align:start position:0%
representative Howard is here to
 
01:09:11.560 --> 01:09:12.910 align:start position:0%
representative Howard is here to
introduce

01:09:12.910 --> 01:09:12.920 align:start position:0%
introduce
 
01:09:15.349 --> 01:09:15.359 align:start position:0%
it I'm going to turn the meeting back
 
01:09:17.910 --> 01:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:20.309 --> 01:09:20.319 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you very much so we're
 
01:09:23.870 --> 01:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
right now at uh HB 603 this is a
 
01:09:25.829 --> 01:09:25.839 align:start position:0%
relative increasing adequacy grants for
 
01:09:27.510 --> 01:09:27.520 align:start position:0%
pupils receiving special education
 
01:09:29.910 --> 01:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
services and I like to re recognize the
 
01:09:31.789 --> 01:09:31.799 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill welcome
 
01:09:33.910 --> 01:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair and uh
 
01:09:35.550 --> 01:09:35.560 align:start position:0%
honorable committee members uh my name
 
01:09:36.950 --> 01:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
is representative Heath Howard I
 
01:09:38.110 --> 01:09:38.120 align:start position:0%
represent the towns of straford and
 
01:09:40.630 --> 01:09:40.640 align:start position:0%
barington in straford District 4 uh
 
01:09:42.990 --> 01:09:43.000 align:start position:0%
today I'm introducing HB 603 which is
 
01:09:45.630 --> 01:09:45.640 align:start position:0%
the perfect number for this legislation
 
01:09:47.030 --> 01:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
uh because I believe that the granite
 
01:09:49.590 --> 01:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
state values education and educational
 
01:09:51.630 --> 01:09:51.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity I am the product of New
 
01:09:53.430 --> 01:09:53.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Public Schools and special
 
01:09:55.790 --> 01:09:55.800 align:start position:0%
education I grew up with an ie p and a
 
01:09:58.630 --> 01:09:58.640 align:start position:0%
504 plan so I understand how beneficial
 
01:10:01.149 --> 01:10:01.159 align:start position:0%
these special education programs can be
 
01:10:02.830 --> 01:10:02.840 align:start position:0%
without the additional support of others
 
01:10:05.030 --> 01:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
to ensure my understanding I don't know
 
01:10:06.350 --> 01:10:06.360 align:start position:0%
if I would be sitting in front of you
 
01:10:08.590 --> 01:10:08.600 align:start position:0%
today I'm very appreciative of the
 
01:10:10.270 --> 01:10:10.280 align:start position:0%
education I've received and I want all
 
01:10:11.750 --> 01:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
other students to be able to achieve the
 
01:10:14.550 --> 01:10:14.560 align:start position:0%
same level of success I've been able to
 
01:10:17.510 --> 01:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
last year when HB 1656 was passed out of
 
01:10:20.510 --> 01:10:20.520 align:start position:0%
house finance with two otpa motions it
 
01:10:22.950 --> 01:10:22.960 align:start position:0%
was a defining moment the establishment
 
01:10:25.390 --> 01:10:25.400 align:start position:0%
of this community uh committee is also a
 
01:10:26.990 --> 01:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
huge opportunity to capitalize on the
 
01:10:29.229 --> 01:10:29.239 align:start position:0%
bipartisan work from last session and
 
01:10:31.070 --> 01:10:31.080 align:start position:0%
address the issue for the betterment of
 
01:10:34.189 --> 01:10:34.199 align:start position:0%
our kids over the past 30 years the
 
01:10:35.669 --> 01:10:35.679 align:start position:0%
state has been failing to meet its
 
01:10:37.750 --> 01:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
constitutional obligation to fund
 
01:10:39.550 --> 01:10:39.560 align:start position:0%
education to an adequate level and to
 
01:10:41.270 --> 01:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
make up for funding gaps sometimes
 
01:10:43.750 --> 01:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
special education takes a cut this hurts
 
01:10:45.630 --> 01:10:45.640 align:start position:0%
both our special education students and
 
01:10:47.310 --> 01:10:47.320 align:start position:0%
general education students because par
 
01:10:48.870 --> 01:10:48.880 align:start position:0%
professionals do a lot around the
 
01:10:51.030 --> 01:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
classroom without their help teachers
 
01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
will have less of an ability to focus on
 
01:10:54.750 --> 01:10:54.760 align:start position:0%
their class as a whole and instead will
 
01:10:56.669 --> 01:10:56.679 align:start position:0%
have to do the work of a PA professional
 
01:10:59.189 --> 01:10:59.199 align:start position:0%
on top of their normal duties keep in
 
01:11:00.310 --> 01:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
mind that the individuals with
 
01:11:02.950 --> 01:11:02.960 align:start position:0%
disability Education Act uh requires
 
01:11:04.470 --> 01:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
that students must be placed in the
 
01:11:07.149 --> 01:11:07.159 align:start position:0%
least restrictive environment possible
 
01:11:09.110 --> 01:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
uh meaning that students should be
 
01:11:10.669 --> 01:11:10.679 align:start position:0%
placed in general education classrooms
 
01:11:13.430 --> 01:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
to the maximum extent we need to focus
 
01:11:15.790 --> 01:11:15.800 align:start position:0%
on creating uh effective classroom
 
01:11:17.430 --> 01:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
environments through collaborative
 
01:11:19.750 --> 01:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
efforts between teachers students and
 
01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:20.870 align:start position:0%
efforts between teachers students and
special

01:11:20.870 --> 01:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
special
 
01:11:23.110 --> 01:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
Educators these funding shortfalls are
 
01:11:25.790 --> 01:11:25.800 align:start position:0%
easy to see uh because last year when
 
01:11:26.830 --> 01:11:26.840 align:start position:0%
the state the state and federal
 
01:11:28.830 --> 01:11:28.840 align:start position:0%
government came together to only fund
 
01:11:32.189 --> 01:11:32.199 align:start position:0%
175% of the cost of disabilities in 2023
 
01:11:34.310 --> 01:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
and that was 1% less than what was
 
01:11:37.110 --> 01:11:37.120 align:start position:0%
provided in 2022 compare that to general
 
01:11:38.629 --> 01:11:38.639 align:start position:0%
education students who receive on
 
01:11:40.950 --> 01:11:40.960 align:start position:0%
average 25% of their total Education
 
01:11:43.310 --> 01:11:43.320 align:start position:0%
costs paid for by the state and federal
 
01:11:46.590 --> 01:11:46.600 align:start position:0%
government local property taxes make up
 
01:11:49.070 --> 01:11:49.080 align:start position:0%
uh any supplemental funding needed which
 
01:11:51.709 --> 01:11:51.719 align:start position:0%
can vary widely from student to student
 
01:11:53.110 --> 01:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
students do not always need the same
 
01:11:57.189 --> 01:11:57.199 align:start position:0%
services and that means uh that
 
01:11:59.430 --> 01:11:59.440 align:start position:0%
uh a they don't receive uh that they
 
01:12:01.310 --> 01:12:01.320 align:start position:0%
don't need the same additional level of
 
01:12:03.669 --> 01:12:03.679 align:start position:0%
uh funding and that can make things
 
01:12:05.830 --> 01:12:05.840 align:start position:0%
unpredictable schools like conval for
 
01:12:07.350 --> 01:12:07.360 align:start position:0%
example saw special education costs
 
01:12:10.510 --> 01:12:10.520 align:start position:0%
increase nearly 40% or $4.4 million
 
01:12:14.750 --> 01:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
during the 2122 to 22 23 school years uh
 
01:12:18.189 --> 01:12:18.199 align:start position:0%
that's 11.2 million to $15.6 million per
 
01:12:20.590 --> 01:12:20.600 align:start position:0%
year a smaller District like plan fill
 
01:12:22.189 --> 01:12:22.199 align:start position:0%
on the other hand saw special education
 
01:12:25.270 --> 01:12:25.280 align:start position:0%
costs increased 118%
 
01:12:28.149 --> 01:12:28.159 align:start position:0%
$1.2 million during the same time period
 
01:12:29.830 --> 01:12:29.840 align:start position:0%
which was slightly under a million doar
 
01:12:33.310 --> 01:12:33.320 align:start position:0%
to $2.1 million a year this volatility
 
01:12:36.390 --> 01:12:36.400 align:start position:0%
can cause severe budget instability with
 
01:12:38.590 --> 01:12:38.600 align:start position:0%
37% of our district spending more than a
 
01:12:40.629 --> 01:12:40.639 align:start position:0%
quarter uh of their entire Budget on
 
01:12:43.110 --> 01:12:43.120 align:start position:0%
special education the federal government
 
01:12:44.910 --> 01:12:44.920 align:start position:0%
protects all students with disabilities
 
01:12:46.390 --> 01:12:46.400 align:start position:0%
and guarantees a right to public
 
01:12:48.669 --> 01:12:48.679 align:start position:0%
education and these students also
 
01:12:50.310 --> 01:12:50.320 align:start position:0%
deserve to not be seen as a financial
 
01:12:51.990 --> 01:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
burden by their local
 
01:12:54.669 --> 01:12:54.679 align:start position:0%
communities currently we use a formula
 
01:12:56.470 --> 01:12:56.480 align:start position:0%
based off of average daily membership
 
01:12:59.709 --> 01:12:59.719 align:start position:0%
and residents uh admr with about 20% of
 
01:13:01.590 --> 01:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
all students receiving some sort of
 
01:13:04.430 --> 01:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
special education services on average
 
01:13:07.189 --> 01:13:07.199 align:start position:0%
the cost per p is about
 
01:13:10.669 --> 01:13:10.679 align:start position:0%
$48,000 uh which is on average $
 
01:13:14.709 --> 01:13:14.719 align:start position:0%
29,5 56 more uh than students without an
 
01:13:16.910 --> 01:13:16.920 align:start position:0%
IB and you can see that uh number
 
01:13:20.229 --> 01:13:20.239 align:start position:0%
clearly on the bill in the bill uh there
 
01:13:22.590 --> 01:13:22.600 align:start position:0%
are a number of factors that incur
 
01:13:24.310 --> 01:13:24.320 align:start position:0%
additional costs like out of District
 
01:13:26.110 --> 01:13:26.120 align:start position:0%
placement that can cost more than
 
01:13:28.990 --> 01:13:29.000 align:start position:0%
$100,000 per year and different kinds of
 
01:13:31.149 --> 01:13:31.159 align:start position:0%
therapy like speech occupational and
 
01:13:33.310 --> 01:13:33.320 align:start position:0%
physical these can be crucial to
 
01:13:35.149 --> 01:13:35.159 align:start position:0%
ensuring the success of a student by
 
01:13:36.709 --> 01:13:36.719 align:start position:0%
providing them with the tools and
 
01:13:39.070 --> 01:13:39.080 align:start position:0%
environment necessary in extreme
 
01:13:41.310 --> 01:13:41.320 align:start position:0%
circumstances catastrophic Aid is
 
01:13:43.510 --> 01:13:43.520 align:start position:0%
provided as a reimbursement for every
 
01:13:46.590 --> 01:13:46.600 align:start position:0%
student that costs more than 3.5 times
 
01:13:48.910 --> 01:13:48.920 align:start position:0%
uh the state average or a cost of more
 
01:13:48.920 --> 01:13:50.629 align:start position:0%
uh the state average or a cost of more
than

01:13:50.629 --> 01:13:50.639 align:start position:0%
than
 
01:13:53.149 --> 01:13:53.159 align:start position:0%
$75,000 the issue is is that if a new
 
01:13:54.870 --> 01:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
student enters during the middle of the
 
01:13:57.030 --> 01:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
year a district must accommodate their
 
01:13:59.110 --> 01:13:59.120 align:start position:0%
needs immediately without any additional
 
01:14:01.470 --> 01:14:01.480 align:start position:0%
funding from the state and they will not
 
01:14:03.709 --> 01:14:03.719 align:start position:0%
receive any catastrophic aid until the
 
01:14:06.510 --> 01:14:06.520 align:start position:0%
following year so I know the big
 
01:14:08.470 --> 01:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
question on everybody's mind is related
 
01:14:09.790 --> 01:14:09.800 align:start position:0%
to the fiscal note on the back of the
 
01:14:13.030 --> 01:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
bill but first we need to thing that we
 
01:14:14.790 --> 01:14:14.800 align:start position:0%
need to understand is that currently any
 
01:14:16.709 --> 01:14:16.719 align:start position:0%
municipality may be subject to
 
01:14:19.310 --> 01:14:19.320 align:start position:0%
unpredictable and VI volatile School
 
01:14:22.950 --> 01:14:22.960 align:start position:0%
budgets during the 20 22 to 23 school
 
01:14:24.390 --> 01:14:24.400 align:start position:0%
year the Department of Education
 
01:14:26.229 --> 01:14:26.239 align:start position:0%
reported that the total special
 
01:14:29.470 --> 01:14:29.480 align:start position:0%
education costs were 915 million uh but
 
01:14:30.870 --> 01:14:30.880 align:start position:0%
that also includes uh other
 
01:14:33.830 --> 01:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
non-instructional costs the real cost of
 
01:14:35.430 --> 01:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
special education in New Hampshire is
 
01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:38.070 align:start position:0%
special education in New Hampshire is
755

01:14:38.070 --> 01:14:38.080 align:start position:0%
755
 
01:14:42.830 --> 01:14:42.840 align:start position:0%
m3675 47 that is only $69 million more
 
01:14:45.430 --> 01:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
than what local property taxpayers uh
 
01:14:48.149 --> 01:14:48.159 align:start position:0%
paid during the last year but those
 
01:14:50.350 --> 01:14:50.360 align:start position:0%
costs were not spread evenly across the
 
01:14:52.950 --> 01:14:52.960 align:start position:0%
state by allocating more funds from the
 
01:14:54.790 --> 01:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
state uh from the state sources instead
 
01:14:56.830 --> 01:14:56.840 align:start position:0%
of local property taxes to cover special
 
01:14:58.629 --> 01:14:58.639 align:start position:0%
education costs there would be more
 
01:15:00.350 --> 01:15:00.360 align:start position:0%
consistent tax impacts from year to year
 
01:15:03.310 --> 01:15:03.320 align:start position:0%
for every municipality this would allow
 
01:15:05.270 --> 01:15:05.280 align:start position:0%
for easier budgeting more Equitable
 
01:15:07.910 --> 01:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
funding and remove risks uh the REM the
 
01:15:10.310 --> 01:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
risk for potential tax spikes overall I
 
01:15:12.950 --> 01:15:12.960 align:start position:0%
believe hp603 would provide uh help
 
01:15:14.790 --> 01:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
provide services to students remove
 
01:15:17.070 --> 01:15:17.080 align:start position:0%
local property tax burdens and allow for
 
01:15:19.110 --> 01:15:19.120 align:start position:0%
flexibility in high in spending and
 
01:15:21.149 --> 01:15:21.159 align:start position:0%
hiring decisions thank you and I'm open
 
01:15:22.990 --> 01:15:23.000 align:start position:0%
to any questions thank you very very
 
01:15:24.870 --> 01:15:24.880 align:start position:0%
much represent Howard represent fell you
 
01:15:28.149 --> 01:15:28.159 align:start position:0%
have a question um yes I first I hope
 
01:15:30.550 --> 01:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
you can provide us that in writing
 
01:15:32.550 --> 01:15:32.560 align:start position:0%
because there are a lot of numbers but
 
01:15:35.430 --> 01:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
um my question is given the fact that we
 
01:15:38.149 --> 01:15:38.159 align:start position:0%
know that just it's so hard to
 
01:15:40.510 --> 01:15:40.520 align:start position:0%
categorize special ed and put it in
 
01:15:43.350 --> 01:15:43.360 align:start position:0%
different categories do you think that
 
01:15:46.510 --> 01:15:46.520 align:start position:0%
um it's better to use a larger figure in
 
01:15:48.950 --> 01:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
in the adequacy aid or maybe should we
 
01:15:51.229 --> 01:15:51.239 align:start position:0%
do something with what used to be called
 
01:15:54.189 --> 01:15:54.199 align:start position:0%
catastrophic a and look more closely
 
01:15:56.350 --> 01:15:56.360 align:start position:0%
which allows the department to look more
 
01:15:59.669 --> 01:15:59.679 align:start position:0%
closely at the specific services that
 
01:16:02.030 --> 01:16:02.040 align:start position:0%
students get and and work on a
 
01:16:03.990 --> 01:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
percentage of that
 
01:16:06.790 --> 01:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
instead yeah I mean uh currently if I'm
 
01:16:08.750 --> 01:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
not mistaken catastrophic Gade makes up
 
01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:09.590 align:start position:0%
not mistaken catastrophic Gade makes up
about

01:16:09.590 --> 01:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:16:12.870 --> 01:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
3.7% of uh education funding across the
 
01:16:16.709 --> 01:16:16.719 align:start position:0%
state and so a lot of it is going to be
 
01:16:20.790 --> 01:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
uh falling on admr uh so it's something
 
01:16:22.550 --> 01:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
where I mean right now because of the
 
01:16:24.550 --> 01:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
way that we calculate things I would say
 
01:16:26.669 --> 01:16:26.679 align:start position:0%
that it would be better if we went with
 
01:16:28.750 --> 01:16:28.760 align:start position:0%
the uh the model that is proposed but
 
01:16:30.629 --> 01:16:30.639 align:start position:0%
there are also some other experts here
 
01:16:33.350 --> 01:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
who can answer that maybe a little bit
 
01:16:35.669 --> 01:16:35.679 align:start position:0%
better represent Howard I I do have a
 
01:16:38.229 --> 01:16:38.239 align:start position:0%
question I'm going to represent papovich
 
01:16:41.110 --> 01:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
um we've been struggling for years with
 
01:16:43.790 --> 01:16:43.800 align:start position:0%
this issue we have
 
01:16:47.149 --> 01:16:47.159 align:start position:0%
31,49 kids that have IEPs projected for
 
01:16:47.159 --> 01:16:49.350 align:start position:0%
31,49 kids that have IEPs projected for
FY

01:16:49.350 --> 01:16:49.360 align:start position:0%
FY
 
01:16:52.629 --> 01:16:52.639 align:start position:0%
26 do you believe that all those
 
01:16:54.990 --> 01:16:55.000 align:start position:0%
students require the same amount of time
 
01:16:58.629 --> 01:16:58.639 align:start position:0%
time and the same amount of costing for
 
01:17:01.470 --> 01:17:01.480 align:start position:0%
example a child that's in first grade
 
01:17:04.430 --> 01:17:04.440 align:start position:0%
may get two sessions of Speech Pathology
 
01:17:06.270 --> 01:17:06.280 align:start position:0%
a week a half hour
 
01:17:09.390 --> 01:17:09.400 align:start position:0%
each another child may require a
 
01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:10.590 align:start position:0%
each another child may require a
full-time

01:17:10.590 --> 01:17:10.600 align:start position:0%
full-time
 
01:17:15.629 --> 01:17:15.639 align:start position:0%
parah um and need a lot of specific even
 
01:17:17.790 --> 01:17:17.800 align:start position:0%
leaning towards even the issues
 
01:17:19.390 --> 01:17:19.400 align:start position:0%
associated with hearing medical issues
 
01:17:22.870 --> 01:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
and all that do those two students
 
01:17:25.229 --> 01:17:25.239 align:start position:0%
should they both be costed out at the
 
01:17:25.239 --> 01:17:27.310 align:start position:0%
should they both be costed out at the
same

01:17:27.310 --> 01:17:27.320 align:start position:0%
same
 
01:17:29.590 --> 01:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
level I mean again it's going to be
 
01:17:31.709 --> 01:17:31.719 align:start position:0%
dependent on uh how much The Individual
 
01:17:33.910 --> 01:17:33.920 align:start position:0%
Services cost but there are people here
 
01:17:35.830 --> 01:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
who are uh experts on this matter who
 
01:17:36.990 --> 01:17:37.000 align:start position:0%
could probably break that down better
 
01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:38.830 align:start position:0%
could probably break that down better
than

01:17:38.830 --> 01:17:38.840 align:start position:0%
than
 
01:17:42.350 --> 01:17:42.360 align:start position:0%
I thank you represent papovich thank you
 
01:17:44.390 --> 01:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you representative
 
01:17:46.830 --> 01:17:46.840 align:start position:0%
for testifying and for working hard to
 
01:17:50.030 --> 01:17:50.040 align:start position:0%
uh you know put a bill together I know
 
01:17:52.870 --> 01:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
it's a tough topic right so my question
 
01:17:55.030 --> 01:17:55.040 align:start position:0%
is along the lines that you're is
 
01:17:57.149 --> 01:17:57.159 align:start position:0%
attempting to basically average out the
 
01:17:59.510 --> 01:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
cost of special education and then
 
01:18:02.510 --> 01:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
distribute the same amount for every kid
 
01:18:04.910 --> 01:18:04.920 align:start position:0%
to every school inevitably this will
 
01:18:06.910 --> 01:18:06.920 align:start position:0%
result in certain schools who have lower
 
01:18:09.470 --> 01:18:09.480 align:start position:0%
costs receiving a windfall while other
 
01:18:11.790 --> 01:18:11.800 align:start position:0%
schools will receive a short fall could
 
01:18:15.350 --> 01:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
you share your thoughts on you know this
 
01:18:17.990 --> 01:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
issue that your bill would probably
 
01:18:21.430 --> 01:18:21.440 align:start position:0%
bring up so I mean right now what we see
 
01:18:23.950 --> 01:18:23.960 align:start position:0%
is any any of our towns right now you
 
01:18:27.070 --> 01:18:27.080 align:start position:0%
could see drastic budgetary changes
 
01:18:29.350 --> 01:18:29.360 align:start position:0%
instantly just because uh of a handful
 
01:18:31.990 --> 01:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
of students who need uh additional IEP
 
01:18:33.990 --> 01:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
uh coverage and that means that your
 
01:18:35.950 --> 01:18:35.960 align:start position:0%
town is going to be the one paying for
 
01:18:39.629 --> 01:18:39.639 align:start position:0%
everything uh this is trying to provide
 
01:18:42.910 --> 01:18:42.920 align:start position:0%
a smoothing out of those those funds
 
01:18:45.830 --> 01:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
because obviously right now we have uh
 
01:18:48.910 --> 01:18:48.920 align:start position:0%
the average cost of of of a student and
 
01:18:51.350 --> 01:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
it's trying to uh still achieve paying
 
01:18:53.709 --> 01:18:53.719 align:start position:0%
for that it's just trying to change uh
 
01:18:56.590 --> 01:18:56.600 align:start position:0%
where that source is from so I I do
 
01:18:59.110 --> 01:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
think that it's going to help kind of uh
 
01:19:02.189 --> 01:19:02.199 align:start position:0%
lower uh as I said potential tax burden
 
01:19:05.590 --> 01:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
on local municipalities uh overall
 
01:19:07.790 --> 01:19:07.800 align:start position:0%
because again you're not going to be
 
01:19:11.229 --> 01:19:11.239 align:start position:0%
subject to potential spikes uh which
 
01:19:13.070 --> 01:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
could cause taxes to go up sub
 
01:19:15.910 --> 01:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
substantially followup
 
01:19:18.189 --> 01:19:18.199 align:start position:0%
yes just a very quick followup I
 
01:19:20.709 --> 01:19:20.719 align:start position:0%
appreciate your thoughts but is there
 
01:19:23.470 --> 01:19:23.480 align:start position:0%
any you know way you could address the
 
01:19:26.070 --> 01:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
windfall versus the shortfall given that
 
01:19:27.910 --> 01:19:27.920 align:start position:0%
again some districts will have a higher
 
01:19:29.510 --> 01:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
cost per student some of them will be
 
01:19:31.350 --> 01:19:31.360 align:start position:0%
lower and we are giving all the same
 
01:19:33.430 --> 01:19:33.440 align:start position:0%
amount of money this issue would happen
 
01:19:36.750 --> 01:19:36.760 align:start position:0%
now because you are giving what is the
 
01:19:39.149 --> 01:19:39.159 align:start position:0%
equivalent you know of an average to
 
01:19:41.310 --> 01:19:41.320 align:start position:0%
everybody so inevitably you give some
 
01:19:43.510 --> 01:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
districts more than they need and the
 
01:19:47.030 --> 01:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
other way around yeah I mean I I
 
01:19:48.470 --> 01:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
understand what you're trying to say and
 
01:19:51.830 --> 01:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
I I do think that right now um again it
 
01:19:53.990 --> 01:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
is something where a lot of small
 
01:19:55.310 --> 01:19:55.320 align:start position:0%
districts like I
 
01:19:57.390 --> 01:19:57.400 align:start position:0%
uh mentioned planfield where they have
 
01:19:59.870 --> 01:19:59.880 align:start position:0%
uh substantial increases and they saw
 
01:20:02.430 --> 01:20:02.440 align:start position:0%
118% uh increase in in their total
 
01:20:05.910 --> 01:20:05.920 align:start position:0%
special education costs uh that is a
 
01:20:10.669 --> 01:20:10.679 align:start position:0%
situation where I I see them struggling
 
01:20:12.430 --> 01:20:12.440 align:start position:0%
quite substantially but being a smaller
 
01:20:15.110 --> 01:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
District their tax impact is going to be
 
01:20:17.149 --> 01:20:17.159 align:start position:0%
uh much more substantial versus a large
 
01:20:20.110 --> 01:20:20.120 align:start position:0%
District so I think that this is overall
 
01:20:22.590 --> 01:20:22.600 align:start position:0%
going to help smaller districts uh
 
01:20:24.870 --> 01:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
versus larger districts if that's what
 
01:20:27.910 --> 01:20:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:30.510 --> 01:20:30.520 align:start position:0%
question yes representative
 
01:20:33.510 --> 01:20:33.520 align:start position:0%
luno thank you very much Mr chair and uh
 
01:20:34.910 --> 01:20:34.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
01:20:36.950 --> 01:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
Howard for uh for bringing this forward
 
01:20:39.189 --> 01:20:39.199 align:start position:0%
uh this morning um I want to sort of go
 
01:20:42.550 --> 01:20:42.560 align:start position:0%
to the fiscal note um for a moment and
 
01:20:45.189 --> 01:20:45.199 align:start position:0%
um go down to
 
01:20:47.790 --> 01:20:47.800 align:start position:0%
the towards the bottom of page two of
 
01:20:49.590 --> 01:20:49.600 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note where it talks about
 
01:20:52.189 --> 01:20:52.199 align:start position:0%
education Freedom accounts and uh and it
 
01:20:54.070 --> 01:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
talks about in the first sentence of
 
01:20:55.470 --> 01:20:55.480 align:start position:0%
that paragraph
 
01:20:59.470 --> 01:20:59.480 align:start position:0%
that um student count of 400 students
 
01:21:01.669 --> 01:21:01.679 align:start position:0%
receiving special education services
 
01:21:03.149 --> 01:21:03.159 align:start position:0%
these are students that have education
 
01:21:04.550 --> 01:21:04.560 align:start position:0%
Freedom counts I'm just wondering where
 
01:21:07.510 --> 01:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
did that number come from uh that would
 
01:21:11.629 --> 01:21:11.639 align:start position:0%
be a better question uh
 
01:21:14.390 --> 01:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
for the LBA I believe or for the
 
01:21:16.270 --> 01:21:16.280 align:start position:0%
Department yes or the department is
 
01:21:17.270 --> 01:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
there somebody from the Department
 
01:21:18.510 --> 01:21:18.520 align:start position:0%
that's going to be coming up later we
 
01:21:20.790 --> 01:21:20.800 align:start position:0%
have several three people from the teric
 
01:21:22.189 --> 01:21:22.199 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very
 
01:21:25.550 --> 01:21:25.560 align:start position:0%
much further questions yes represent man
 
01:21:27.189 --> 01:21:27.199 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm intrigued by representative
 
01:21:31.629 --> 01:21:31.639 align:start position:0%
lad's um question is I see that I was at
 
01:21:33.229 --> 01:21:33.239 align:start position:0%
a Schoolboard meeting this Thursday and
 
01:21:35.709 --> 01:21:35.719 align:start position:0%
and we were told that the the um average
 
01:21:39.189 --> 01:21:39.199 align:start position:0%
cost of a par is around $225,000 a year
 
01:21:40.870 --> 01:21:40.880 align:start position:0%
not including their um things and you're
 
01:21:43.910 --> 01:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
covering the cost of a per in this bill
 
01:21:45.430 --> 01:21:45.440 align:start position:0%
is there any way in the world that this
 
01:21:48.550 --> 01:21:48.560 align:start position:0%
can be written almost Grant wise as up
 
01:21:51.870 --> 01:21:51.880 align:start position:0%
to 29,000 and putting a cap on it there
 
01:21:54.110 --> 01:21:54.120 align:start position:0%
are some students in my classes that
 
01:21:56.390 --> 01:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
have a pair so I I'll have three in one
 
01:21:57.950 --> 01:21:57.960 align:start position:0%
class but I have special ed kids in
 
01:22:00.110 --> 01:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
another class with no pairs at all they
 
01:22:02.229 --> 01:22:02.239 align:start position:0%
won't require the full 29,000 is there
 
01:22:04.990 --> 01:22:05.000 align:start position:0%
any way that it can be it can be
 
01:22:07.390 --> 01:22:07.400 align:start position:0%
acquired according to the specific needs
 
01:22:08.990 --> 01:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
of each
 
01:22:12.870 --> 01:22:12.880 align:start position:0%
student that that's a good question uh I
 
01:22:16.430 --> 01:22:16.440 align:start position:0%
am unsure because there may be federal
 
01:22:19.990 --> 01:22:20.000 align:start position:0%
law that uh prevents any sort of of
 
01:22:21.470 --> 01:22:21.480 align:start position:0%
scaling because I I have had some
 
01:22:22.950 --> 01:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
conversations with some people about
 
01:22:25.070 --> 01:22:25.080 align:start position:0%
that uh and I I'm I'm sorry that I can't
 
01:22:26.550 --> 01:22:26.560 align:start position:0%
provide a more concise answer but there
 
01:22:28.310 --> 01:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
might be people here uh who are experts
 
01:22:30.030 --> 01:22:30.040 align:start position:0%
who might be able to answer that
 
01:22:33.470 --> 01:22:33.480 align:start position:0%
better are there further questions not
 
01:22:35.950 --> 01:22:35.960 align:start position:0%
seeing any thank you very much uh thank
 
01:22:38.430 --> 01:22:38.440 align:start position:0%
you due to the number of cards we'
 
01:22:40.390 --> 01:22:40.400 align:start position:0%
received on this I am going to limitate
 
01:22:42.830 --> 01:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
uh time uh for the remaining of the
 
01:22:46.510 --> 01:22:46.520 align:start position:0%
people about three minutes per uh
 
01:22:49.550 --> 01:22:49.560 align:start position:0%
presentation so with that I'd like to
 
01:23:07.910 --> 01:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:10.070 --> 01:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
okay good morning chairman lad members
 
01:23:12.550 --> 01:23:12.560 align:start position:0%
of the House Education funding committee
 
01:23:14.590 --> 01:23:14.600 align:start position:0%
uh I am Deborah H president of the
 
01:23:16.189 --> 01:23:16.199 align:start position:0%
American Federation of teachers New
 
01:23:18.310 --> 01:23:18.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I am here to speak in
 
01:23:21.950 --> 01:23:21.960 align:start position:0%
support of this bill um I will not go
 
01:23:23.510 --> 01:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
into a lot of the statistics because
 
01:23:25.430 --> 01:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
others will speak on but I just want to
 
01:23:27.390 --> 01:23:27.400 align:start position:0%
give a little bit of perspective we feel
 
01:23:30.510 --> 01:23:30.520 align:start position:0%
this is a long overdue bill that will
 
01:23:33.870 --> 01:23:33.880 align:start position:0%
help give better support to our students
 
01:23:35.790 --> 01:23:35.800 align:start position:0%
with individualized and specialized
 
01:23:38.550 --> 01:23:38.560 align:start position:0%
education needs in our school districts
 
01:23:41.270 --> 01:23:41.280 align:start position:0%
as well as uh make sure that all of our
 
01:23:42.550 --> 01:23:42.560 align:start position:0%
grand State
 
01:23:45.709 --> 01:23:45.719 align:start position:0%
students keep that opportunity for
 
01:23:47.750 --> 01:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
robust public education in our Public
 
01:23:50.669 --> 01:23:50.679 align:start position:0%
Schools right now we have a situation
 
01:23:53.830 --> 01:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
where um because of the way our schools
 
01:23:55.430 --> 01:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
are funded
 
01:23:58.189 --> 01:23:58.199 align:start position:0%
local property taxpayers are carrying
 
01:24:00.990 --> 01:24:01.000 align:start position:0%
80% of the burden of the general funding
 
01:24:04.430 --> 01:24:04.440 align:start position:0%
of our schools and just about well 70 70
 
01:24:06.430 --> 01:24:06.440 align:start position:0%
to 8% of the burden and about 80% of the
 
01:24:08.189 --> 01:24:08.199 align:start position:0%
burden for special
 
01:24:08.199 --> 01:24:09.790 align:start position:0%
burden for special
education

01:24:09.790 --> 01:24:09.800 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:24:14.229 --> 01:24:14.239 align:start position:0%
um if this bill were to pass it would
 
01:24:20.070 --> 01:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
give local districts the ability to not
 
01:24:23.149 --> 01:24:23.159 align:start position:0%
have to go to local property taxpayers
 
01:24:27.189 --> 01:24:27.199 align:start position:0%
over every in increase in the need to
 
01:24:29.270 --> 01:24:29.280 align:start position:0%
provide more support for a special
 
01:24:29.280 --> 01:24:30.870 align:start position:0%
provide more support for a special
education

01:24:30.870 --> 01:24:30.880 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:24:33.189 --> 01:24:33.199 align:start position:0%
student and it would allow them to do
 
01:24:35.629 --> 01:24:35.639 align:start position:0%
something that is much needed which is
 
01:24:38.629 --> 01:24:38.639 align:start position:0%
invest in their Workforce so they can
 
01:24:41.149 --> 01:24:41.159 align:start position:0%
fill some of these vacancies that will
 
01:24:44.910 --> 01:24:44.920 align:start position:0%
give a better educational situation for
 
01:24:47.189 --> 01:24:47.199 align:start position:0%
students with special education needs
 
01:24:49.310 --> 01:24:49.320 align:start position:0%
when you have a consistent team around
 
01:24:53.510 --> 01:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
you day in and day out students learn
 
01:24:53.520 --> 01:24:54.950 align:start position:0%
you day in and day out students learn
better

01:24:54.950 --> 01:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
better
 
01:24:56.669 --> 01:24:56.679 align:start position:0%
um you know so if you have the same
 
01:25:00.270 --> 01:25:00.280 align:start position:0%
teacher instead of um someone remote
 
01:25:02.350 --> 01:25:02.360 align:start position:0%
because you've hired a special education
 
01:25:06.070 --> 01:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
teacher over a remote service from
 
01:25:07.590 --> 01:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
another state out west because you
 
01:25:09.790 --> 01:25:09.800 align:start position:0%
couldn't fill the vacancy a student will
 
01:25:11.990 --> 01:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
learn better when you have the same par
 
01:25:14.910 --> 01:25:14.920 align:start position:0%
educator every day instead of someone
 
01:25:17.430 --> 01:25:17.440 align:start position:0%
from a temp service that you've had to
 
01:25:19.669 --> 01:25:19.679 align:start position:0%
hire the student will learn better
 
01:25:21.629 --> 01:25:21.639 align:start position:0%
because that par educator will know what
 
01:25:23.830 --> 01:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
is in the students individualized
 
01:25:25.750 --> 01:25:25.760 align:start position:0%
education plan instead of whoever
 
01:25:27.830 --> 01:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
they've hired that day that week having
 
01:25:29.790 --> 01:25:29.800 align:start position:0%
to start fresh every day that's last
 
01:25:32.910 --> 01:25:32.920 align:start position:0%
learning opportunity we need to be able
 
01:25:37.149 --> 01:25:37.159 align:start position:0%
to invest in our education
 
01:25:40.270 --> 01:25:40.280 align:start position:0%
Workforce possibly you raising the pay
 
01:25:41.430 --> 01:25:41.440 align:start position:0%
certainly would help us fill those
 
01:25:43.109 --> 01:25:43.119 align:start position:0%
positions but also providing a
 
01:25:43.119 --> 01:25:44.430 align:start position:0%
positions but also providing a
manageable

01:25:44.430 --> 01:25:44.440 align:start position:0%
manageable
 
01:25:47.510 --> 01:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
workload so um we're overburdening the
 
01:25:49.629 --> 01:25:49.639 align:start position:0%
people we have which is why we have so
 
01:25:52.229 --> 01:25:52.239 align:start position:0%
many vacancies but we're also not paying
 
01:25:55.709 --> 01:25:55.719 align:start position:0%
them enough um provide in extra funding
 
01:25:58.350 --> 01:25:58.360 align:start position:0%
would let us fill those positions and
 
01:26:00.950 --> 01:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
help the students better and I'm going
 
01:26:02.189 --> 01:26:02.199 align:start position:0%
to stop there because it's a little hard
 
01:26:04.510 --> 01:26:04.520 align:start position:0%
for me to talk today uh if you have
 
01:26:07.149 --> 01:26:07.159 align:start position:0%
questions I will be glad to try and
 
01:26:08.910 --> 01:26:08.920 align:start position:0%
answer them
 
01:26:11.510 --> 01:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
but um there are others who will give
 
01:26:13.750 --> 01:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
you a lot more raw data on this I just
 
01:26:16.669 --> 01:26:16.679 align:start position:0%
want to provide a few human pieces of
 
01:26:19.070 --> 01:26:19.080 align:start position:0%
this from um what our members you know
 
01:26:20.430 --> 01:26:20.440 align:start position:0%
tell us about what's going on in the
 
01:26:22.590 --> 01:26:22.600 align:start position:0%
field thank thank you very much are
 
01:26:25.390 --> 01:26:25.400 align:start position:0%
there questions
 
01:26:29.229 --> 01:26:29.239 align:start position:0%
not repr Burton Quick um is it true that
 
01:26:31.430 --> 01:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
most teacher training programs do
 
01:26:33.109 --> 01:26:33.119 align:start position:0%
include special education in the
 
01:26:35.910 --> 01:26:35.920 align:start position:0%
curriculum so that teachers are not
 
01:26:38.470 --> 01:26:38.480 align:start position:0%
necessarily specialized they some
 
01:26:41.550 --> 01:26:41.560 align:start position:0%
teachers are more but most teachers do
 
01:26:43.709 --> 01:26:43.719 align:start position:0%
get Special Ed training right so most
 
01:26:47.550 --> 01:26:47.560 align:start position:0%
teachers get some training in helping
 
01:26:50.310 --> 01:26:50.320 align:start position:0%
students with exceptional learning needs
 
01:26:52.870 --> 01:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
it is um an
 
01:26:56.149 --> 01:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
overview and then you have teachers who
 
01:26:58.149 --> 01:26:58.159 align:start position:0%
go more in depth and take several
 
01:27:00.950 --> 01:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
courses in that um so they can get a
 
01:27:02.629 --> 01:27:02.639 align:start position:0%
Special Education
 
01:27:04.629 --> 01:27:04.639 align:start position:0%
certification if you
 
01:27:07.750 --> 01:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
do want to work specifically with
 
01:27:09.910 --> 01:27:09.920 align:start position:0%
students uh with specialized learning
 
01:27:11.550 --> 01:27:11.560 align:start position:0%
needs you need more than just the you
 
01:27:13.750 --> 01:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
know one overview course you need uh
 
01:27:16.750 --> 01:27:16.760 align:start position:0%
numerous courses and you know continuing
 
01:27:19.390 --> 01:27:19.400 align:start position:0%
education every year in the field uh CU
 
01:27:21.830 --> 01:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
there are always more things you need to
 
01:27:23.669 --> 01:27:23.679 align:start position:0%
learn about because the students in
 
01:27:25.709 --> 01:27:25.719 align:start position:0%
front of you you have so many different
 
01:27:27.870 --> 01:27:27.880 align:start position:0%
needs you're always having to take
 
01:27:31.109 --> 01:27:31.119 align:start position:0%
workshops uh and you know study on your
 
01:27:33.390 --> 01:27:33.400 align:start position:0%
own to know how to meet the students
 
01:27:36.870 --> 01:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
needs so it's a huge investment of your
 
01:27:37.990 --> 01:27:38.000 align:start position:0%
time and
 
01:27:41.870 --> 01:27:41.880 align:start position:0%
energy to learn what to do with each
 
01:27:43.830 --> 01:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
student because they truly have indiv
 
01:27:45.830 --> 01:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
individual needs that you need to learn
 
01:27:49.310 --> 01:27:49.320 align:start position:0%
to meet thank you not seeing any other
 
01:27:51.750 --> 01:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
hands thank you very much uh I'd like to
 
01:28:10.910 --> 01:28:10.920 align:start position:0%

today welcome
 
01:28:26.149 --> 01:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
good morning chairman lad good morning
 
01:28:28.030 --> 01:28:28.040 align:start position:0%
education finance committee members my
 
01:28:30.149 --> 01:28:30.159 align:start position:0%
name is Michaela Deiter and it's good to
 
01:28:32.669 --> 01:28:32.679 align:start position:0%
see you again today I'm speaking only
 
01:28:35.270 --> 01:28:35.280 align:start position:0%
for myself though I'll remind you that I
 
01:28:37.950 --> 01:28:37.960 align:start position:0%
am a do School Board member and I also
 
01:28:39.510 --> 01:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
am on staff with the New Hampshire
 
01:28:42.030 --> 01:28:42.040 align:start position:0%
school funding fairness project I've
 
01:28:43.550 --> 01:28:43.560 align:start position:0%
brought some additional information
 
01:28:45.669 --> 01:28:45.679 align:start position:0%
today about Dover Schools that I wasn't
 
01:28:48.270 --> 01:28:48.280 align:start position:0%
able to share two weeks ago when I last
 
01:28:50.430 --> 01:28:50.440 align:start position:0%
testified in the past 10 and I'm going
 
01:28:52.830 --> 01:28:52.840 align:start position:0%
to be referencing the um the charts that
 
01:28:55.990 --> 01:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
you see on the handouts that you do or
 
01:28:58.030 --> 01:28:58.040 align:start position:0%
do not have
 
01:29:01.030 --> 01:29:01.040 align:start position:0%
uh in the past 10 years the number of do
 
01:29:04.070 --> 01:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
students placed in outof District
 
01:29:06.790 --> 01:29:06.800 align:start position:0%
placements increased from 40 to 61
 
01:29:08.709 --> 01:29:08.719 align:start position:0%
that's a 52%
 
01:29:11.149 --> 01:29:11.159 align:start position:0%
increase despite the fact that our total
 
01:29:13.189 --> 01:29:13.199 align:start position:0%
student population in that same 10-year
 
01:29:15.270 --> 01:29:15.280 align:start position:0%
time frame decreased by
 
01:29:18.189 --> 01:29:18.199 align:start position:0%
10% those 61 students they received more
 
01:29:21.430 --> 01:29:21.440 align:start position:0%
than $7.4 million of services just last
 
01:29:23.189 --> 01:29:23.199 align:start position:0%
year that represents an average of over
 
01:29:28.030 --> 01:29:28.040 align:start position:0%
120 $1,000 per students outof District
 
01:29:30.390 --> 01:29:30.400 align:start position:0%
placements are projected in our district
 
01:29:32.550 --> 01:29:32.560 align:start position:0%
to increase at a rate of approximately 4
 
01:29:36.510 --> 01:29:36.520 align:start position:0%
to 5% every year conservative estimates
 
01:29:40.070 --> 01:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
indicate that by the year 2034 each
 
01:29:43.229 --> 01:29:43.239 align:start position:0%
student will cost an average of over
 
01:29:45.350 --> 01:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
$200,000 by all measures special
 
01:29:48.629 --> 01:29:48.639 align:start position:0%
education services are very expensive I
 
01:29:50.229 --> 01:29:50.239 align:start position:0%
know you know
 
01:29:54.390 --> 01:29:54.400 align:start position:0%
this we must remember HB 63's nearly
 
01:29:57.910 --> 01:29:57.920 align:start position:0%
$900 million cost which feels pretty
 
01:30:01.030 --> 01:30:01.040 align:start position:0%
scary does not represent new expenses
 
01:30:04.229 --> 01:30:04.239 align:start position:0%
for new Services New Hampshire taxpayers
 
01:30:06.510 --> 01:30:06.520 align:start position:0%
already spend nearly a billion dollars
 
01:30:08.750 --> 01:30:08.760 align:start position:0%
each year on these existing special

services do has considered creating an
 
01:30:15.030 --> 01:30:15.040 align:start position:0%
intensive needs Elementary program
 
01:30:16.870 --> 01:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
you'll see that on slides I believe
 
01:30:19.030 --> 01:30:19.040 align:start position:0%
three four and five in the
 
01:30:21.109 --> 01:30:21.119 align:start position:0%
handouts we've considered creating an
 
01:30:23.470 --> 01:30:23.480 align:start position:0%
intensive needs Elementary program which
 
01:30:25.870 --> 01:30:25.880 align:start position:0%
after growing to its full capacity which
 
01:30:28.669 --> 01:30:28.679 align:start position:0%
would take about 4 to 6 years would
 
01:30:31.669 --> 01:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
still cost around $100,000 per student
 
01:30:33.669 --> 01:30:33.679 align:start position:0%
annually while this would allow more
 
01:30:35.390 --> 01:30:35.400 align:start position:0%
students to remain in District and
 
01:30:38.149 --> 01:30:38.159 align:start position:0%
provide a large savings over time this
 
01:30:40.109 --> 01:30:40.119 align:start position:0%
proposal was still so prohibitively
 
01:30:42.189 --> 01:30:42.199 align:start position:0%
expensive that we did not include it in
 
01:30:44.109 --> 01:30:44.119 align:start position:0%
our budget for next year despite the
 
01:30:46.109 --> 01:30:46.119 align:start position:0%
fact that we know it will in the long
 
01:30:48.470 --> 01:30:48.480 align:start position:0%
term save our district money it is too
 
01:30:51.189 --> 01:30:51.199 align:start position:0%
expensive to implement right now do is
 
01:30:53.109 --> 01:30:53.119 align:start position:0%
far from unique in its large and
 
01:30:55.990 --> 01:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
unpredictable special education costs
 
01:30:58.189 --> 01:30:58.199 align:start position:0%
this is a reality in every single
 
01:31:00.709 --> 01:31:00.719 align:start position:0%
District in our state there is not an
 
01:31:03.109 --> 01:31:03.119 align:start position:0%
exception when the state only funds 10
 
01:31:05.310 --> 01:31:05.320 align:start position:0%
and a half% of the true cost of
 
01:31:08.310 --> 01:31:08.320 align:start position:0%
disability services local taxpayers like
 
01:31:10.470 --> 01:31:10.480 align:start position:0%
you like me like all the people sitting
 
01:31:13.149 --> 01:31:13.159 align:start position:0%
behind me right now are forced to pay
 
01:31:15.350 --> 01:31:15.360 align:start position:0%

01:31:20.350 --> 01:31:20.360 align:start position:0%
financial responsibility for these
 
01:31:22.550 --> 01:31:22.560 align:start position:0%
existing services to the state could
 
01:31:25.109 --> 01:31:25.119 align:start position:0%
even out existing cost costs so all
 
01:31:26.790 --> 01:31:26.800 align:start position:0%
taxpayers are contributing a
 
01:31:29.629 --> 01:31:29.639 align:start position:0%
proportional share at a uniform rate for
 
01:31:32.430 --> 01:31:32.440 align:start position:0%
all these reasons I support HB 63 and
 
01:31:34.109 --> 01:31:34.119 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions thank
 
01:31:36.270 --> 01:31:36.280 align:start position:0%
you very very much Michaela are there
 
01:31:38.470 --> 01:31:38.480 align:start position:0%
questions represent papovich thank you
 
01:31:40.270 --> 01:31:40.280 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you for testifying
 
01:31:42.189 --> 01:31:42.199 align:start position:0%
and for answering questions you
 
01:31:43.430 --> 01:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
mentioned at the beginning of your
 
01:31:44.790 --> 01:31:44.800 align:start position:0%
testimony that out of District
 
01:31:46.590 --> 01:31:46.600 align:start position:0%
placements increase from about 40 to
 
01:31:48.430 --> 01:31:48.440 align:start position:0%
about 60 despite a drop in overall
 
01:31:50.870 --> 01:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
student population I'm sure you spent a
 
01:31:52.590 --> 01:31:52.600 align:start position:0%
lot of time trying to understand that
 
01:31:54.510 --> 01:31:54.520 align:start position:0%
issue can you help us understand what's
 
01:31:57.990 --> 01:31:58.000 align:start position:0%
happening are your kids health you know
 
01:32:00.030 --> 01:32:00.040 align:start position:0%
issues getting worse do you have people
 
01:32:02.830 --> 01:32:02.840 align:start position:0%
moving out of district with uh kids with
 
01:32:04.510 --> 01:32:04.520 align:start position:0%
special needs what do you think is going
 
01:32:06.750 --> 01:32:06.760 align:start position:0%
on yeah so out of District placements in
 
01:32:09.990 --> 01:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
general and and I I I will give the big
 
01:32:11.790 --> 01:32:11.800 align:start position:0%
caveat that I am not the student
 
01:32:13.750 --> 01:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
services director of our district of
 
01:32:15.510 --> 01:32:15.520 align:start position:0%
course so I am not the best person to
 
01:32:17.830 --> 01:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
answer these questions but from what I
 
01:32:19.270 --> 01:32:19.280 align:start position:0%
understand for my service on the do
 
01:32:21.270 --> 01:32:21.280 align:start position:0%
school board the placements out of
 
01:32:23.030 --> 01:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
District in general are going to
 
01:32:25.629 --> 01:32:25.639 align:start position:0%
represent either um specific medical
 
01:32:28.350 --> 01:32:28.360 align:start position:0%
needs not MediCal specific educational
 
01:32:30.709 --> 01:32:30.719 align:start position:0%
needs so for example um a student who
 
01:32:33.709 --> 01:32:33.719 align:start position:0%
has um a a severe autism might need to
 
01:32:36.109 --> 01:32:36.119 align:start position:0%
go to a district uh a school out of
 
01:32:38.470 --> 01:32:38.480 align:start position:0%
District placement that is better able
 
01:32:40.189 --> 01:32:40.199 align:start position:0%
to meet that student's needs in a way
 
01:32:42.550 --> 01:32:42.560 align:start position:0%
that the do public school system cannot
 
01:32:44.629 --> 01:32:44.639 align:start position:0%
meet that student's needs um there are
 
01:32:46.189 --> 01:32:46.199 align:start position:0%
many students who are leaving the
 
01:32:47.550 --> 01:32:47.560 align:start position:0%
district because of emotional
 
01:32:50.310 --> 01:32:50.320 align:start position:0%
disturbances students who cannot be safe
 
01:32:51.709 --> 01:32:51.719 align:start position:0%
in the public school learning
 
01:32:53.669 --> 01:32:53.679 align:start position:0%
environment they are going to districts
 
01:32:56.550 --> 01:32:56.560 align:start position:0%
with where the specialty staff there are
 
01:32:58.830 --> 01:32:58.840 align:start position:0%
able to handle the emotional outbursts
 
01:33:00.590 --> 01:33:00.600 align:start position:0%
the specific learning needs we have
 
01:33:03.390 --> 01:33:03.400 align:start position:0%
other students who are um who may be um
 
01:33:06.310 --> 01:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
deaf or blind or DEA lined who have uh
 
01:33:07.830 --> 01:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
specific learning needs that are just
 
01:33:09.510 --> 01:33:09.520 align:start position:0%
impossible to meet in the general
 
01:33:12.390 --> 01:33:12.400 align:start position:0%
education setting so it is a mix but in
 
01:33:15.350 --> 01:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
general I would say the um the the
 
01:33:18.910 --> 01:33:18.920 align:start position:0%
increase is definitely represented by um
 
01:33:21.310 --> 01:33:21.320 align:start position:0%
more people more students being
 
01:33:23.870 --> 01:33:23.880 align:start position:0%
identified on the Spectrum who have
 
01:33:25.709 --> 01:33:25.719 align:start position:0%
those uh elevated needs and then also
 
01:33:27.470 --> 01:33:27.480 align:start position:0%
more students who need that emotional
 
01:33:30.229 --> 01:33:30.239 align:start position:0%
behavioral disturbance support thank you
 
01:33:31.950 --> 01:33:31.960 align:start position:0%
you're welcome further questions from
 
01:33:34.550 --> 01:33:34.560 align:start position:0%
the committee yes represent
 
01:33:36.830 --> 01:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
01:33:40.189 --> 01:33:40.199 align:start position:0%
being here and um supporting
 
01:33:44.310 --> 01:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
this I'm very intrigued by I think you
 
01:33:46.350 --> 01:33:46.360 align:start position:0%
in your handout called it the harbor
 
01:33:49.030 --> 01:33:49.040 align:start position:0%
program so that's your
 
01:33:52.470 --> 01:33:52.480 align:start position:0%
dover's uh proposed IND
 
01:33:54.830 --> 01:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
District what quote outof District
 
01:33:56.510 --> 01:33:56.520 align:start position:0%
placement is that accurate like you're
 
01:33:59.830 --> 01:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
creating your own local version of an
 
01:34:02.390 --> 01:34:02.400 align:start position:0%
out of District yep so so we have three
 
01:34:04.350 --> 01:34:04.360 align:start position:0%
elementary schools one middle school and
 
01:34:06.629 --> 01:34:06.639 align:start position:0%
one high school um our high school has
 
01:34:10.229 --> 01:34:10.239 align:start position:0%
an emotional disturbance type um in
 
01:34:12.590 --> 01:34:12.600 align:start position:0%
District but separated program our
 
01:34:14.590 --> 01:34:14.600 align:start position:0%
middle school has one that is located
 
01:34:16.750 --> 01:34:16.760 align:start position:0%
within a specific wing of the middle
 
01:34:19.270 --> 01:34:19.280 align:start position:0%
school but our elementary level doesn't
 
01:34:21.510 --> 01:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
have anything for the K through four
 
01:34:24.350 --> 01:34:24.360 align:start position:0%
grades so the Harper program was what
 
01:34:25.750 --> 01:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
was presented to our school board in
 
01:34:27.709 --> 01:34:27.719 align:start position:0%
November when we were doing our budget
 
01:34:29.910 --> 01:34:29.920 align:start position:0%
deliberations um and you'll see if you
 
01:34:32.510 --> 01:34:32.520 align:start position:0%
can if you can find you have one okay so
 
01:34:34.470 --> 01:34:34.480 align:start position:0%
you'll see uh three or four of those
 
01:34:36.750 --> 01:34:36.760 align:start position:0%
slides we're directly taken from the
 
01:34:38.350 --> 01:34:38.360 align:start position:0%
presentation that our teaching and
 
01:34:39.669 --> 01:34:39.679 align:start position:0%
learning department and our special
 
01:34:42.189 --> 01:34:42.199 align:start position:0%
education department gave to us um the
 
01:34:45.229 --> 01:34:45.239 align:start position:0%
goal of the harbor program was to bring
 
01:34:47.750 --> 01:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
students inhouse because we know that
 
01:34:49.149 --> 01:34:49.159 align:start position:0%
when students have an opportunity to
 
01:34:51.229 --> 01:34:51.239 align:start position:0%
learn within their home District that's
 
01:34:52.990 --> 01:34:53.000 align:start position:0%
a real benefit because they get to be
 
01:34:54.550 --> 01:34:54.560 align:start position:0%
with peers peers who might be on their
 
01:34:56.590 --> 01:34:56.600 align:start position:0%
sports teams or who they might see at
 
01:34:58.550 --> 01:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
the playgrounds there's a real benefit
 
01:35:00.790 --> 01:35:00.800 align:start position:0%
to that and for some students who are
 
01:35:03.310 --> 01:35:03.320 align:start position:0%
just beyond the thresholds of needing
 
01:35:05.470 --> 01:35:05.480 align:start position:0%
services that our U regular education
 
01:35:07.709 --> 01:35:07.719 align:start position:0%
teachers can't provide or even with a
 
01:35:10.149 --> 01:35:10.159 align:start position:0%
paa in the classroom they still can't
 
01:35:12.310 --> 01:35:12.320 align:start position:0%
access those Services these are for
 
01:35:14.709 --> 01:35:14.719 align:start position:0%
those students who might need to be
 
01:35:16.750 --> 01:35:16.760 align:start position:0%
placed out of District simply because we
 
01:35:19.189 --> 01:35:19.199 align:start position:0%
don't have those resources there so the
 
01:35:21.229 --> 01:35:21.239 align:start position:0%
goal of the district was to be able to
 
01:35:24.310 --> 01:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
provide to build in an in-house like a a
 
01:35:26.990 --> 01:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
school within a school almost um a
 
01:35:29.070 --> 01:35:29.080 align:start position:0%
self-contained program that would have
 
01:35:30.790 --> 01:35:30.800 align:start position:0%
the opportunity for students when
 
01:35:33.229 --> 01:35:33.239 align:start position:0%
appropriate to be able to access general
 
01:35:34.910 --> 01:35:34.920 align:start position:0%
education settings because we know
 
01:35:36.950 --> 01:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
that's really important for students too
 
01:35:38.990 --> 01:35:39.000 align:start position:0%
to be able to do that and to be able to
 
01:35:41.109 --> 01:35:41.119 align:start position:0%
be with their peers as much as possible
 
01:35:43.669 --> 01:35:43.679 align:start position:0%
but to still be with um within a really
 
01:35:46.470 --> 01:35:46.480 align:start position:0%
scaffolded program that is staffed by
 
01:35:47.990 --> 01:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
professionals and you'll see the list
 
01:35:49.990 --> 01:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
and the cost of the list of those
 
01:35:51.830 --> 01:35:51.840 align:start position:0%
professionals who would be able to
 
01:35:53.430 --> 01:35:53.440 align:start position:0%
provide that support for the students
 
01:35:55.910 --> 01:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
where and when they need
 
01:35:59.430 --> 01:35:59.440 align:start position:0%
it thank you I we have a number of
 
01:36:01.950 --> 01:36:01.960 align:start position:0%
people um we are going to have from the
 
01:36:04.070 --> 01:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
Department tomorrow I just got last
 
01:36:04.080 --> 01:36:05.510 align:start position:0%
Department tomorrow I just got last
night

01:36:05.510 --> 01:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
night
 
01:36:08.070 --> 01:36:08.080 align:start position:0%
communication uh identifying those
 
01:36:09.990 --> 01:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
schools which have types of programs
 
01:36:11.390 --> 01:36:11.400 align:start position:0%
you're talking about I know we have one
 
01:36:14.750 --> 01:36:14.760 align:start position:0%
King Street up in havil and and uh the
 
01:36:16.149 --> 01:36:16.159 align:start position:0%
number of students that are in those
 
01:36:19.390 --> 01:36:19.400 align:start position:0%
programs we're seeing a a a few
 
01:36:21.030 --> 01:36:21.040 align:start position:0%
districts in the state a few you know
 
01:36:23.709 --> 01:36:23.719 align:start position:0%
out of the total which have these really
 
01:36:25.830 --> 01:36:25.840 align:start position:0%
heavy heavy
 
01:36:29.430 --> 01:36:29.440 align:start position:0%
costs um so we're also got information
 
01:36:32.070 --> 01:36:32.080 align:start position:0%
going back for the last 10 or so years
 
01:36:34.590 --> 01:36:34.600 align:start position:0%
of the 13 category areas with a number
 
01:36:36.830 --> 01:36:36.840 align:start position:0%
of students in each of those categories
 
01:36:39.590 --> 01:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
and yes there are several categories
 
01:36:41.430 --> 01:36:41.440 align:start position:0%
where we're seeing it
 
01:36:44.629 --> 01:36:44.639 align:start position:0%
going uh elevating with number of
 
01:36:47.870 --> 01:36:47.880 align:start position:0%
students so if we will have that discuss
 
01:36:50.750 --> 01:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
tomorrow so it you know from those which
 
01:36:53.390 --> 01:36:53.400 align:start position:0%
are really tied to it from the director
 
01:36:55.629 --> 01:36:55.639 align:start position:0%
um we may hold some of those questions
 
01:36:57.629 --> 01:36:57.639 align:start position:0%
for that time then it might help us get
 
01:36:59.189 --> 01:36:59.199 align:start position:0%
through all these people we have here
 
01:37:00.550 --> 01:37:00.560 align:start position:0%

01:37:50.950 --> 01:37:50.960 align:start position:0%
there special education Advocates office
 
01:37:54.229 --> 01:37:54.239 align:start position:0%
yes good morning again um uh I will try
 
01:37:56.030 --> 01:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
to be very brief on this
 
01:38:00.070 --> 01:38:00.080 align:start position:0%
one your numbers the the number in this
 
01:38:02.470 --> 01:38:02.480 align:start position:0%
bill comes much closer what our actual
 
01:38:05.310 --> 01:38:05.320 align:start position:0%
cost of special education is it it it is
 
01:38:08.149 --> 01:38:08.159 align:start position:0%
pretty directly matched up however I do
 
01:38:10.830 --> 01:38:10.840 align:start position:0%
think it has the very significant flaw
 
01:38:13.189 --> 01:38:13.199 align:start position:0%
that um both representative lad in a
 
01:38:15.510 --> 01:38:15.520 align:start position:0%
prior question and representative Mahan
 
01:38:17.990 --> 01:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
kind of alluded to which is that there
 
01:38:20.149 --> 01:38:20.159 align:start position:0%
are many students whose costs don't even
 
01:38:23.550 --> 01:38:23.560 align:start position:0%
begin to approach that 29,000 and and it
 
01:38:24.830 --> 01:38:24.840 align:start position:0%
there's where I would see the very
 
01:38:26.390 --> 01:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
perverse incentives because we might
 
01:38:29.470 --> 01:38:29.480 align:start position:0%
have many students who should be in the
 
01:38:31.070 --> 01:38:31.080 align:start position:0%
multi-tiered system of support and not
 
01:38:34.470 --> 01:38:34.480 align:start position:0%
in the special education system who you
 
01:38:38.430 --> 01:38:38.440 align:start position:0%
know providing 29,000 per student would
 
01:38:40.950 --> 01:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
bump them into that category not to
 
01:38:45.430 --> 01:38:45.440 align:start position:0%
mention 504 plans we have many many many
 
01:38:47.910 --> 01:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
students on 504 plans who receive very
 
01:38:51.030 --> 01:38:51.040 align:start position:0%
similar services to some of the IEP
 
01:38:53.109 --> 01:38:53.119 align:start position:0%
Services there's a legal distinction
 
01:38:54.750 --> 01:38:54.760 align:start position:0%
that gets them in one category versus
 
01:38:57.790 --> 01:38:57.800 align:start position:0%
the other but it's a very gray area and
 
01:38:59.390 --> 01:38:59.400 align:start position:0%
we are often talking about whether it's
 
01:39:02.229 --> 01:39:02.239 align:start position:0%
an IEP or a 504 the 504 plans would get
 
01:39:04.629 --> 01:39:04.639 align:start position:0%
none of this if you went with a flat
 
01:39:06.790 --> 01:39:06.800 align:start position:0%
rate that is this High which does mirror
 
01:39:07.990 --> 01:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
the actual
 
01:39:11.109 --> 01:39:11.119 align:start position:0%
cost Statewide you're going to have
 
01:39:13.109 --> 01:39:13.119 align:start position:0%
really serious perverse incentives in
 
01:39:15.390 --> 01:39:15.400 align:start position:0%
terms of Shifting students so so I don't
 
01:39:17.390 --> 01:39:17.400 align:start position:0%
think it's feasible to have a single
 
01:39:20.149 --> 01:39:20.159 align:start position:0%
flat rate cost like this um I was just
 
01:39:24.830 --> 01:39:24.840 align:start position:0%
speaking um with my colleague uh At Doe
 
01:39:27.550 --> 01:39:27.560 align:start position:0%
the the idea that somehow we have to get
 
01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:29.870 align:start position:0%
the the idea that somehow we have to get
to

01:39:29.870 --> 01:39:29.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:39:33.950 --> 01:39:33.960 align:start position:0%
numbers that better match costs for
 
01:39:35.750 --> 01:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
districts so that the funds are not
 
01:39:37.470 --> 01:39:37.480 align:start position:0%
coming from all of your general
 
01:39:39.629 --> 01:39:39.639 align:start position:0%
education resources and not creating you
 
01:39:40.709 --> 01:39:40.719 align:start position:0%
know real
 
01:39:44.030 --> 01:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
divisiveness um is one I
 
01:39:47.149 --> 01:39:47.159 align:start position:0%
support I think that it is worth really
 
01:39:50.070 --> 01:39:50.080 align:start position:0%
exploring the idea of how do you do it
 
01:39:53.589 --> 01:39:53.599 align:start position:0%
more based on a cap and a costing per
 
01:39:55.149 --> 01:39:55.159 align:start position:0%
you know the services that are actually
 
01:39:55.159 --> 01:39:56.030 align:start position:0%
you know the services that are actually
being

01:39:56.030 --> 01:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
being
 
01:39:58.470 --> 01:39:58.480 align:start position:0%
provided it requires more study and I I
 
01:40:01.070 --> 01:40:01.080 align:start position:0%
will be honest with you doe will require
 
01:40:03.030 --> 01:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
additional resources
 
01:40:07.589 --> 01:40:07.599 align:start position:0%
and person power to handle um that kind
 
01:40:10.790 --> 01:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
of a an inquiry but um I think the
 
01:40:14.270 --> 01:40:14.280 align:start position:0%
numbers need to come up and they need to
 
01:40:16.709 --> 01:40:16.719 align:start position:0%
be based on Services provided would be
 
01:40:18.270 --> 01:40:18.280 align:start position:0%
my two pieces of
 
01:40:20.310 --> 01:40:20.320 align:start position:0%
advice thank you very
 
01:40:24.030 --> 01:40:24.040 align:start position:0%
much any questions yes
 
01:40:27.270 --> 01:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
thank you chair um can you can you speak
 
01:40:31.270 --> 01:40:31.280 align:start position:0%
to how the cost decreases with an excess
 
01:40:33.870 --> 01:40:33.880 align:start position:0%
with a successful IEP program as he
 
01:40:35.629 --> 01:40:35.639 align:start position:0%
progresses over time he needs less and
 
01:40:38.470 --> 01:40:38.480 align:start position:0%
less how does that decrease his personal
 
01:40:42.109 --> 01:40:42.119 align:start position:0%
cost sure so you're going to be talking
 
01:40:44.270 --> 01:40:44.280 align:start position:0%
about predominantly you know your your
 
01:40:46.870 --> 01:40:46.880 align:start position:0%
students currently in the category a
 
01:40:48.669 --> 01:40:48.679 align:start position:0%
data reported so so your question goes
 
01:40:51.589 --> 01:40:51.599 align:start position:0%
to the majority of IEP students a lot of
 
01:40:55.070 --> 01:40:55.080 align:start position:0%
them are receiving services
 
01:40:59.990 --> 01:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
that should over time catch them up or
 
01:41:04.470 --> 01:41:04.480 align:start position:0%
give them tools um to potentially handle
 
01:41:06.589 --> 01:41:06.599 align:start position:0%
uh the curriculum without all of those
 
01:41:08.189 --> 01:41:08.199 align:start position:0%
tools or stepping down maybe not without
 
01:41:10.790 --> 01:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
but stepping down to multitude systems
 
01:41:12.709 --> 01:41:12.719 align:start position:0%
of supports that are available in the
 
01:41:14.510 --> 01:41:14.520 align:start position:0%
regular um
 
01:41:17.870 --> 01:41:17.880 align:start position:0%
gened setting it's probably not
 
01:41:19.950 --> 01:41:19.960 align:start position:0%
realistic for some of your students who
 
01:41:21.950 --> 01:41:21.960 align:start position:0%
who have higher needs they probably are
 
01:41:25.350 --> 01:41:25.360 align:start position:0%
going to be needing significant IEP
 
01:41:27.910 --> 01:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
Services throughout their time but again
 
01:41:29.750 --> 01:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
that is the much smaller fraction of the
 
01:41:33.790 --> 01:41:33.800 align:start position:0%
students so adequately funding and
 
01:41:36.310 --> 01:41:36.320 align:start position:0%
serving the majority of our students who
 
01:41:38.470 --> 01:41:38.480 align:start position:0%
do have
 
01:41:41.550 --> 01:41:41.560 align:start position:0%
needs should mean that over time um and
 
01:41:43.149 --> 01:41:43.159 align:start position:0%
a lot of parents are pushing for this
 
01:41:45.310 --> 01:41:45.320 align:start position:0%
right that the IEP framework is is very
 
01:41:47.030 --> 01:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
cumbersome they don't necessarily want
 
01:41:51.229 --> 01:41:51.239 align:start position:0%
Services forever um you might well be
 
01:41:53.470 --> 01:41:53.480 align:start position:0%
able to uh in a lot of those what are
 
01:41:55.390 --> 01:41:55.400 align:start position:0%
currently category a
 
01:41:58.270 --> 01:41:58.280 align:start position:0%
situations step down if schools had
 
01:42:00.149 --> 01:42:00.159 align:start position:0%
adequate multi-tiered systems of support
 
01:42:01.629 --> 01:42:01.639 align:start position:0%
so that's something really to be looking
 
01:42:04.109 --> 01:42:04.119 align:start position:0%
at when we're talking about costs um
 
01:42:05.830 --> 01:42:05.840 align:start position:0%
reading Specialists math Specialists who
 
01:42:08.510 --> 01:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
are not iup service providers in all of
 
01:42:11.149 --> 01:42:11.159 align:start position:0%
our schools thank you very much further
 
01:42:13.790 --> 01:42:13.800 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much thank you
 
01:42:16.430 --> 01:42:16.440 align:start position:0%
I'd like to invite uh is it Maggie
 
01:42:19.149 --> 01:42:19.159 align:start position:0%
Larson or is that
 
01:42:22.910 --> 01:42:22.920 align:start position:0%
close thank you thank you chairman glad
 
01:42:24.750 --> 01:42:24.760 align:start position:0%
and Representatives this is my first
 
01:42:27.470 --> 01:42:27.480 align:start position:0%
time test testifying or having a
 
01:42:30.390 --> 01:42:30.400 align:start position:0%
testimony in here and I'm eight years on
 
01:42:32.990 --> 01:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
the Summers worth school board so um I
 
01:42:34.870 --> 01:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
do have written testimonies signed by
 
01:42:37.310 --> 01:42:37.320 align:start position:0%
all of my Schoolboard members and uh our
 
01:42:39.950 --> 01:42:39.960 align:start position:0%
mayor and city councilors but I want to
 
01:42:43.589 --> 01:42:43.599 align:start position:0%
First speak about um needing help this
 
01:42:45.109 --> 01:42:45.119 align:start position:0%
is the first time I'm coming up here and
 
01:42:47.149 --> 01:42:47.159 align:start position:0%
speaking with you all because I'm a
 
01:42:49.910 --> 01:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
mother I have three teens and uh a point
 
01:42:52.070 --> 01:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
was just raised about IEPs and the
 
01:42:54.750 --> 01:42:54.760 align:start position:0%
development um two of my boys were
 
01:42:57.109 --> 01:42:57.119 align:start position:0%
twinss and they had an IEP that they
 
01:42:58.870 --> 01:42:58.880 align:start position:0%
graduated out of because of early
 
01:43:01.390 --> 01:43:01.400 align:start position:0%
interventions at the preschool level in
 
01:43:04.669 --> 01:43:04.679 align:start position:0%
summersworth our taxpayers pay for 83%
 
01:43:07.350 --> 01:43:07.360 align:start position:0%
um of our special ed needs we're waving
 
01:43:10.109 --> 01:43:10.119 align:start position:0%
a white flag we need help we've just had
 
01:43:12.790 --> 01:43:12.800 align:start position:0%
a cut 14 positions in our district
 
01:43:15.229 --> 01:43:15.239 align:start position:0%
because we cannot cover teaching
 
01:43:19.470 --> 01:43:19.480 align:start position:0%
positions um of a a trade program which
 
01:43:21.629 --> 01:43:21.639 align:start position:0%
is devastating because we need to keep
 
01:43:23.270 --> 01:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
up and there's just no other way that we
 
01:43:24.310 --> 01:43:24.320 align:start position:0%
can fund
 
01:43:28.390 --> 01:43:28.400 align:start position:0%
this we are unique we are a small city
 
01:43:32.070 --> 01:43:32.080 align:start position:0%
um we have such dedicated Educators and
 
01:43:34.589 --> 01:43:34.599 align:start position:0%
our community is our strength to tell my
 
01:43:38.030 --> 01:43:38.040 align:start position:0%
neighbors that they their taxes will go
 
01:43:40.430 --> 01:43:40.440 align:start position:0%
up because of children's needs little
 
01:43:42.430 --> 01:43:42.440 align:start position:0%
children's early we see it at the
 
01:43:44.629 --> 01:43:44.639 align:start position:0%
earliest level in preschool we're seeing
 
01:43:49.950 --> 01:43:49.960 align:start position:0%
increasing needs our ouri on special
 
01:43:52.550 --> 01:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
education at the earliest level through
 
01:43:55.950 --> 01:43:55.960 align:start position:0%
age 22 is needed we'll see that I know
 
01:43:58.629 --> 01:43:58.639 align:start position:0%
that's true I don't usually kind of
 
01:44:01.709 --> 01:44:01.719 align:start position:0%
advocate for things in this way but
 
01:44:03.229 --> 01:44:03.239 align:start position:0%
we're not just Treading Water we're
 
01:44:05.550 --> 01:44:05.560 align:start position:0%
almost taking on water at this point in
 
01:44:08.629 --> 01:44:08.639 align:start position:0%
our city so I really you know learning
 
01:44:10.669 --> 01:44:10.679 align:start position:0%
about The Spill and advocating for it
 
01:44:13.149 --> 01:44:13.159 align:start position:0%
and advocating for those needs we are
 
01:44:16.109 --> 01:44:16.119 align:start position:0%
also looking at developing in-house
 
01:44:19.109 --> 01:44:19.119 align:start position:0%
programs so we don't have so many outof
 
01:44:21.030 --> 01:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
district um
 
01:44:23.310 --> 01:44:23.320 align:start position:0%
placements but we need a little we need
 
01:44:25.189 --> 01:44:25.199 align:start position:0%
more funding to even be able to get
 
01:44:27.990 --> 01:44:28.000 align:start position:0%
there so I don't want this to impact our
 
01:44:30.310 --> 01:44:30.320 align:start position:0%
entire school system and all the
 
01:44:32.709 --> 01:44:32.719 align:start position:0%
students just because we don't have um
 
01:44:36.390 --> 01:44:36.400 align:start position:0%
our 30% of our entire budget goes to um
 
01:44:39.589 --> 01:44:39.599 align:start position:0%
special ed that's it in summary um I
 
01:44:41.790 --> 01:44:41.800 align:start position:0%
will submit my uh written testimony and
 
01:44:44.510 --> 01:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
our figures and facts um I have the
 
01:44:47.950 --> 01:44:47.960 align:start position:0%
entire um School Board which is no no
 
01:44:51.709 --> 01:44:51.719 align:start position:0%
easy feat in in in support of this um
 
01:44:53.189 --> 01:44:53.199 align:start position:0%
because we just we don't we don't don't
 
01:44:54.629 --> 01:44:54.639 align:start position:0%
see a way out if there's not more
 
01:44:56.070 --> 01:44:56.080 align:start position:0%
funding for special
 
01:44:59.629 --> 01:44:59.639 align:start position:0%
ed thank you very much M your your
 
01:45:02.030 --> 01:45:02.040 align:start position:0%
comments Echo throughout this
 
01:45:05.430 --> 01:45:05.440 align:start position:0%
state are there any questions represent
 
01:45:07.629 --> 01:45:07.639 align:start position:0%
Burton thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:45:09.629 --> 01:45:09.639 align:start position:0%
for taking my question is summersworth
 
01:45:12.910 --> 01:45:12.920 align:start position:0%
its own School District yes further
 
01:45:16.550 --> 01:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
question yes 20 years ago it was part of
 
01:45:19.189 --> 01:45:19.199 align:start position:0%
a school district with Durham Le Madbury
 
01:45:21.270 --> 01:45:21.280 align:start position:0%
and Rollinsford you know when Oyster
 
01:45:23.790 --> 01:45:23.800 align:start position:0%
River broke off did that hurt
 
01:45:27.390 --> 01:45:27.400 align:start position:0%
summersworth when you went on your own I
 
01:45:31.669 --> 01:45:31.679 align:start position:0%
moved here 17 years ago from Boston so
 
01:45:34.669 --> 01:45:34.679 align:start position:0%
all is that Rel relative to this bill
 
01:45:36.109 --> 01:45:36.119 align:start position:0%
actually we're talking about special
 
01:45:38.750 --> 01:45:38.760 align:start position:0%
education here now if you're I'm talking
 
01:45:42.229 --> 01:45:42.239 align:start position:0%
about that scale of support Mr chairman
 
01:45:44.550 --> 01:45:44.560 align:start position:0%
uh for this program for for the
 
01:45:44.560 --> 01:45:45.990 align:start position:0%
uh for this program for for the
summersworth

01:45:45.990 --> 01:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
summersworth
 
01:45:48.990 --> 01:45:49.000 align:start position:0%
program when they were with a bigger
 
01:45:50.910 --> 01:45:50.920 align:start position:0%
School District they had more help
 
01:45:52.390 --> 01:45:52.400 align:start position:0%
that's all the point of that's what I
 
01:45:54.390 --> 01:45:54.400 align:start position:0%
was asking special for the help in
 
01:45:59.950 --> 01:45:59.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:02.950 --> 01:46:02.960 align:start position:0%
correct listening to your colleague
 
01:46:06.270 --> 01:46:06.280 align:start position:0%
thank you are there further further
 
01:46:08.830 --> 01:46:08.840 align:start position:0%
questions thank yes represent fellows
 
01:46:12.470 --> 01:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
are there any Regional centers that um
 
01:46:14.990 --> 01:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
maybe they're private or they I know
 
01:46:17.350 --> 01:46:17.360 align:start position:0%
there used to be s a thing called sest
 
01:46:20.030 --> 01:46:20.040 align:start position:0%
that had offered services that could be
 
01:46:21.629 --> 01:46:21.639 align:start position:0%
special ed that could be kind of a
 
01:46:25.149 --> 01:46:25.159 align:start position:0%
center for do and summersworth and that
 
01:46:27.030 --> 01:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
sounds I'm not familiar with that that
 
01:46:28.830 --> 01:46:28.840 align:start position:0%
sounds like a great idea we're just
 
01:46:30.589 --> 01:46:30.599 align:start position:0%
we're we're the small City that we are
 
01:46:32.270 --> 01:46:32.280 align:start position:0%
seeing these needs and we have to
 
01:46:34.790 --> 01:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
address the needs in our city only if we
 
01:46:36.870 --> 01:46:36.880 align:start position:0%
do um send out there's just such
 
01:46:39.629 --> 01:46:39.639 align:start position:0%
significant cost to that for less than a
 
01:46:41.709 --> 01:46:41.719 align:start position:0%
tenth of our school population it's over
 
01:46:45.310 --> 01:46:45.320 align:start position:0%
$2 million to send them out of District
 
01:46:48.109 --> 01:46:48.119 align:start position:0%
so yes the SES program I'm familiar with
 
01:46:49.750 --> 01:46:49.760 align:start position:0%
what they did with the monies and they
 
01:46:51.189 --> 01:46:51.199 align:start position:0%
did professional training and all that
 
01:46:54.790 --> 01:46:54.800 align:start position:0%
as well um I don't know and that would
 
01:46:56.589 --> 01:46:56.599 align:start position:0%
be a question when we have the people
 
01:46:59.589 --> 01:46:59.599 align:start position:0%
from the uh Department thank you
 
01:47:03.070 --> 01:47:03.080 align:start position:0%

Esposito is that Lewis Lewis yeah yeah
 
01:47:16.550 --> 01:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:18.510 --> 01:47:18.520 align:start position:0%
again I think I asked the question
 
01:47:21.589 --> 01:47:21.599 align:start position:0%
before you're related to Phil um not as
 
01:47:23.430 --> 01:47:23.440 align:start position:0%
often as I used to be no
 
01:47:25.709 --> 01:47:25.719 align:start position:0%
um but uh no I do get that quite a bit
 
01:47:28.189 --> 01:47:28.199 align:start position:0%
not as much as I I used to like I said
 
01:47:29.950 --> 01:47:29.960 align:start position:0%
um but thank you all I provided some
 
01:47:32.550 --> 01:47:32.560 align:start position:0%
written testimony um my name is lisis
 
01:47:34.589 --> 01:47:34.599 align:start position:0%
espito I'm the executive director at
 
01:47:36.470 --> 01:47:36.480 align:start position:0%
able New Hampshire um but before
 
01:47:38.189 --> 01:47:38.199 align:start position:0%
stepping into this role and I think I've
 
01:47:40.030 --> 01:47:40.040 align:start position:0%
been hearing um a lot of you all talk
 
01:47:42.310 --> 01:47:42.320 align:start position:0%
today um about education obviously but I
 
01:47:44.109 --> 01:47:44.119 align:start position:0%
was a special education teacher for many
 
01:47:46.950 --> 01:47:46.960 align:start position:0%
years um I was an emotional disabilities
 
01:47:48.550 --> 01:47:48.560 align:start position:0%
teacher and I was an intellectual
 
01:47:50.109 --> 01:47:50.119 align:start position:0%
disabilities teacher and those are the
 
01:47:51.709 --> 01:47:51.719 align:start position:0%
two uh positions that you all are
 
01:47:53.629 --> 01:47:53.639 align:start position:0%
talking about that are increasing
 
01:47:54.990 --> 01:47:55.000 align:start position:0%
significantly without a district
 
01:47:58.470 --> 01:47:58.480 align:start position:0%
placements um I love my students um I
 
01:48:00.629 --> 01:48:00.639 align:start position:0%
took them to prom I got a CDL bus
 
01:48:01.910 --> 01:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
driver's license so I could drive them
 
01:48:03.350 --> 01:48:03.360 align:start position:0%
to their Community to have better
 
01:48:05.709 --> 01:48:05.719 align:start position:0%
programming um I did everything I
 
01:48:08.629 --> 01:48:08.639 align:start position:0%
possibly could for them um when I was uh
 
01:48:10.750 --> 01:48:10.760 align:start position:0%
my my first year teaching I was super
 
01:48:13.070 --> 01:48:13.080 align:start position:0%
excited I finally had my own classroom
 
01:48:14.950 --> 01:48:14.960 align:start position:0%
and um I had a vision about how I could
 
01:48:16.950 --> 01:48:16.960 align:start position:0%
educate um my students in that
 
01:48:18.350 --> 01:48:18.360 align:start position:0%
particular room had intellectual
 
01:48:21.310 --> 01:48:21.320 align:start position:0%
disability um they required augmented
 
01:48:22.910 --> 01:48:22.920 align:start position:0%
communication systems they requireed
 
01:48:24.350 --> 01:48:24.360 align:start position:0%
ired uh speech and language they
 
01:48:27.109 --> 01:48:27.119 align:start position:0%
required OT Physical Therapy um they
 
01:48:28.589 --> 01:48:28.599 align:start position:0%
were not as mainstreamed as a lot of the
 
01:48:30.350 --> 01:48:30.360 align:start position:0%
other students were they had significant
 
01:48:32.709 --> 01:48:32.719 align:start position:0%
behavioral needs that we had to work on
 
01:48:34.430 --> 01:48:34.440 align:start position:0%
um these are the ones that were pretty
 
01:48:36.270 --> 01:48:36.280 align:start position:0%
close to going out of District um and a
 
01:48:38.109 --> 01:48:38.119 align:start position:0%
lot of funds were given to them but
 
01:48:39.470 --> 01:48:39.480 align:start position:0%
despite those funds I want to share with
 
01:48:42.310 --> 01:48:42.320 align:start position:0%
you what my classroom looked like um we
 
01:48:45.229 --> 01:48:45.239 align:start position:0%
had a uh a shared community space with
 
01:48:47.149 --> 01:48:47.159 align:start position:0%
uh three other teachers so I was one of
 
01:48:49.070 --> 01:48:49.080 align:start position:0%
four teachers there were about 30 pair
 
01:48:51.229 --> 01:48:51.239 align:start position:0%
of professionals um in this little area
 
01:48:53.470 --> 01:48:53.480 align:start position:0%
there was a little tiny hallway um my
 
01:48:55.709 --> 01:48:55.719 align:start position:0%
classroom walls were office dividers uh
 
01:48:57.910 --> 01:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
my door was a shower curtain um and this
 
01:49:00.350 --> 01:49:00.360 align:start position:0%
was a moderately paying a moderate
 
01:49:02.350 --> 01:49:02.360 align:start position:0%
funded School District um it was very
 
01:49:04.229 --> 01:49:04.239 align:start position:0%
challenging despite my students having
 
01:49:05.390 --> 01:49:05.400 align:start position:0%
exceptional needs and exceptionable
 
01:49:07.030 --> 01:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
funds just to have a basic thing like a
 
01:49:09.390 --> 01:49:09.400 align:start position:0%
classroom it interfered it prevented um
 
01:49:12.669 --> 01:49:12.679 align:start position:0%
a lot of progress um if a student leaned
 
01:49:15.430 --> 01:49:15.440 align:start position:0%
too hard for example on a door it would
 
01:49:18.149 --> 01:49:18.159 align:start position:0%
knock over I had to set it all up um it
 
01:49:20.229 --> 01:49:20.239 align:start position:0%
it was pretty challenging um it it it
 
01:49:21.910 --> 01:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
increased my burnout um not going to lie
 
01:49:24.189 --> 01:49:24.199 align:start position:0%
I I love my students as much as I can um
 
01:49:26.189 --> 01:49:26.199 align:start position:0%
this was known as uh in that particular
 
01:49:28.390 --> 01:49:28.400 align:start position:0%
school it was the the former vocational
 
01:49:30.470 --> 01:49:30.480 align:start position:0%
wing it was called v114 so my students
 
01:49:32.229 --> 01:49:32.239 align:start position:0%
not only were special education students
 
01:49:34.709 --> 01:49:34.719 align:start position:0%
they were called uh v114 students which
 
01:49:36.589 --> 01:49:36.599 align:start position:0%
is a whole another level of stigma when
 
01:49:39.550 --> 01:49:39.560 align:start position:0%
you really think about it um later on in
 
01:49:41.910 --> 01:49:41.920 align:start position:0%
life I became an emotional disabilities
 
01:49:45.149 --> 01:49:45.159 align:start position:0%
teacher um typically um I was their
 
01:49:48.229 --> 01:49:48.239 align:start position:0%
their biggest cheerleader I was I've had
 
01:49:49.950 --> 01:49:49.960 align:start position:0%
days where I thought I was putting out
 
01:49:53.149 --> 01:49:53.159 align:start position:0%
literal fires um I I've had days where I
 
01:49:54.750 --> 01:49:54.760 align:start position:0%
had students that had to be removed for
 
01:49:56.550 --> 01:49:56.560 align:start position:0%
medical emergencies due to um emotional
 
01:49:58.910 --> 01:49:58.920 align:start position:0%
distress at the same on the same day of
 
01:50:00.669 --> 01:50:00.679 align:start position:0%
a student getting into a fight on the
 
01:50:02.390 --> 01:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
same day of a parent yelling and while
 
01:50:04.750 --> 01:50:04.760 align:start position:0%
also supporting someone through um a
 
01:50:08.750 --> 01:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
really challenging test um and what we
 
01:50:11.550 --> 01:50:11.560 align:start position:0%
lacked for Ambi we were very ambitious
 
01:50:13.870 --> 01:50:13.880 align:start position:0%
but we didn't really have the best um
 
01:50:15.390 --> 01:50:15.400 align:start position:0%
emotional support in terms of mental
 
01:50:16.510 --> 01:50:16.520 align:start position:0%
health counseling that was something
 
01:50:17.629 --> 01:50:17.639 align:start position:0%
that the school district really had a
 
01:50:21.390 --> 01:50:21.400 align:start position:0%
hard time um financing and um to being
 
01:50:23.550 --> 01:50:23.560 align:start position:0%
an emotional disabilities teacher and in
 
01:50:25.310 --> 01:50:25.320 align:start position:0%
this relatively um well-off School
 
01:50:27.310 --> 01:50:27.320 align:start position:0%
District um to not have a mental health
 
01:50:28.870 --> 01:50:28.880 align:start position:0%
counselor supporting us it was very
 
01:50:31.990 --> 01:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
challenging um a lot of times it also
 
01:50:33.390 --> 01:50:33.400 align:start position:0%
contributed with with a frequent
 
01:50:35.430 --> 01:50:35.440 align:start position:0%
turnover of related staff Professionals
 
01:50:37.709 --> 01:50:37.719 align:start position:0%
of speech and language therapists were
 
01:50:39.990 --> 01:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
um rotating in and out we had to
 
01:50:42.270 --> 01:50:42.280 align:start position:0%
contract out for transition Services it
 
01:50:44.750 --> 01:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
was really challenging so students um
 
01:50:46.030 --> 01:50:46.040 align:start position:0%
instead of relying on a lot of these
 
01:50:49.589 --> 01:50:49.599 align:start position:0%
related services but come to us so I you
 
01:50:50.910 --> 01:50:50.920 align:start position:0%
know I know you're all here talking
 
01:50:52.870 --> 01:50:52.880 align:start position:0%
about uh funding and I just just wanted
 
01:50:55.030 --> 01:50:55.040 align:start position:0%
to share that perspective of an educator
 
01:50:56.510 --> 01:50:56.520 align:start position:0%
and what it's like to be on that P on
 
01:50:58.430 --> 01:50:58.440 align:start position:0%
that side of the argument so thank you
 
01:50:59.870 --> 01:50:59.880 align:start position:0%
and I can answer any questions thank you
 
01:51:01.550 --> 01:51:01.560 align:start position:0%
very much are there any questions from
 
01:51:06.229 --> 01:51:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:21.109 --> 01:51:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:23.950 --> 01:51:23.960 align:start position:0%
Shen good morning morning still um my
 
01:51:25.629 --> 01:51:25.639 align:start position:0%
name is Zach shien I'm the executive
 
01:51:27.229 --> 01:51:27.239 align:start position:0%
director of the New Hampshire school
 
01:51:30.069 --> 01:51:30.079 align:start position:0%
funding fairness project uh we are here
 
01:51:33.629 --> 01:51:33.639 align:start position:0%
in support of House Bill 603 I'll try to
 
01:51:35.589 --> 01:51:35.599 align:start position:0%
bounce around a little bit to not repeat
 
01:51:37.830 --> 01:51:37.840 align:start position:0%
as much as what has been said before I
 
01:51:39.550 --> 01:51:39.560 align:start position:0%
am passing around a report we put
 
01:51:42.030 --> 01:51:42.040 align:start position:0%
together using most recently available
 
01:51:44.669 --> 01:51:44.679 align:start position:0%
special education funding related data
 
01:51:46.950 --> 01:51:46.960 align:start position:0%
from the doe um so it might be a little
 
01:51:48.229 --> 01:51:48.239 align:start position:0%
different than some of the numbers that
 
01:51:51.669 --> 01:51:51.679 align:start position:0%
were heard earlier um in general I want
 
01:51:54.550 --> 01:51:54.560 align:start position:0%
to kind of give the perspective of the
 
01:51:57.229 --> 01:51:57.239 align:start position:0%
intent of this bill right is to name the
 
01:51:59.069 --> 01:51:59.079 align:start position:0%
upper limit of what we are already
 
01:52:00.950 --> 01:52:00.960 align:start position:0%
paying for in special education cost I
 
01:52:03.069 --> 01:52:03.079 align:start position:0%
think it's important to reiterate that
 
01:52:05.030 --> 01:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
the number set in the differentiated Aid
 
01:52:07.910 --> 01:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
increase in house bille 603 um is the
 
01:52:10.149 --> 01:52:10.159 align:start position:0%
actual average additional expenditure
 
01:52:13.310 --> 01:52:13.320 align:start position:0%
for students receiving special education
 
01:52:18.830 --> 01:52:18.840 align:start position:0%
services um and that is a significant in
 
01:52:20.830 --> 01:52:20.840 align:start position:0%
or significant Gap just like every other
 
01:52:23.350 --> 01:52:23.360 align:start position:0%
part of our school funding system
 
01:52:25.069 --> 01:52:25.079 align:start position:0%
um we've already heard that uh
 
01:52:27.790 --> 01:52:27.800 align:start position:0%
during um you know there's about 300
 
01:52:30.870 --> 01:52:30.880 align:start position:0%
31,49 students receiving IEPs as of the
 
01:52:32.910 --> 01:52:32.920 align:start position:0%
most recently available data and in our
 
01:52:35.149 --> 01:52:35.159 align:start position:0%
adequacy formula we acknowledge that
 
01:52:37.229 --> 01:52:37.239 align:start position:0%
these Services cost additional money we
 
01:52:39.390 --> 01:52:39.400 align:start position:0%
have an additional
 
01:52:41.750 --> 01:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
$2,142 going to every single student
 
01:52:43.750 --> 01:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
right that receive special education
 
01:52:46.270 --> 01:52:46.280 align:start position:0%
services the challenge is you know
 
01:52:47.990 --> 01:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
there's a windfall versus a shortfall
 
01:52:50.149 --> 01:52:50.159 align:start position:0%
question earlier that is an absolute
 
01:52:52.189 --> 01:52:52.199 align:start position:0%
shortfall for every single District in
 
01:52:52.199 --> 01:52:53.109 align:start position:0%
shortfall for every single District in
the

01:52:53.109 --> 01:52:53.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:52:55.109 --> 01:52:55.119 align:start position:0%
State regardless of the amount of
 
01:52:56.750 --> 01:52:56.760 align:start position:0%
services you're providing no district is
 
01:52:58.669 --> 01:52:58.679 align:start position:0%
operating their special education
 
01:53:01.709 --> 01:53:01.719 align:start position:0%
services with just that 21 42 per
 
01:53:03.350 --> 01:53:03.360 align:start position:0%
student and that is the amount that
 
01:53:05.189 --> 01:53:05.199 align:start position:0%
we're have in our adequacy for formula
 
01:53:07.229 --> 01:53:07.239 align:start position:0%
saying here's how much you get for your
 
01:53:10.350 --> 01:53:10.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:14.270 --> 01:53:14.280 align:start position:0%
costs additionally um about 25% of total
 
01:53:16.550 --> 01:53:16.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire education uh Public School
 
01:53:18.550 --> 01:53:18.560 align:start position:0%
spending was from special education
 
01:53:19.870 --> 01:53:19.880 align:start position:0%
costs and you've heard that there's been
 
01:53:22.270 --> 01:53:22.280 align:start position:0%
a number of increases over the years
 
01:53:24.669 --> 01:53:24.679 align:start position:0%
that been compare uh combined with a
 
01:53:26.589 --> 01:53:26.599 align:start position:0%
decreasing percentage that the state and
 
01:53:28.510 --> 01:53:28.520 align:start position:0%
federal governments are putting in um
 
01:53:30.470 --> 01:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
it's been going down about 1% each year
 
01:53:32.189 --> 01:53:32.199 align:start position:0%
the past three or four
 
01:53:34.550 --> 01:53:34.560 align:start position:0%
years I think the the really kind of
 
01:53:36.189 --> 01:53:36.199 align:start position:0%
critical piece to examine here we've
 
01:53:37.750 --> 01:53:37.760 align:start position:0%
heard a number of different elements
 
01:53:40.790 --> 01:53:40.800 align:start position:0%
relative to is this a kind of increase
 
01:53:42.470 --> 01:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
across the board versus the these
 
01:53:44.229 --> 01:53:44.239 align:start position:0%
different tiers but I hope that what
 
01:53:46.270 --> 01:53:46.280 align:start position:0%
you're taking away is that without a
 
01:53:47.390 --> 01:53:47.400 align:start position:0%
doubt the amount of money we're
 
01:53:49.149 --> 01:53:49.159 align:start position:0%
providing now is nowhere close to
 
01:53:50.790 --> 01:53:50.800 align:start position:0%
sufficient and so we need to be looking
 
01:53:53.030 --> 01:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
at significantly increasing that taking
 
01:53:54.790 --> 01:53:54.800 align:start position:0%
into account a number of complicated
 
01:53:57.470 --> 01:53:57.480 align:start position:0%
elements that folks have testified to um
 
01:54:00.109 --> 01:54:00.119 align:start position:0%
before me and this problem is not uh
 
01:54:02.870 --> 01:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
going away it's increasing in scope um
 
01:54:06.270 --> 01:54:06.280 align:start position:0%
about 70 out of the 176 New Hampshire
 
01:54:10.270 --> 01:54:10.280 align:start position:0%
Public Schools spent more than 25% of
 
01:54:12.589 --> 01:54:12.599 align:start position:0%
their total budget on special education
 
01:54:14.390 --> 01:54:14.400 align:start position:0%
services that's 10 more schools than
 
01:54:17.149 --> 01:54:17.159 align:start position:0%
just last year right so we're increasing
 
01:54:19.589 --> 01:54:19.599 align:start position:0%
not only at a clip from schools but at a
 
01:54:21.550 --> 01:54:21.560 align:start position:0%
proportion of their total budgets that
 
01:54:23.990 --> 01:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
are going toward Education Services and
 
01:54:25.910 --> 01:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
so the question is not if we're going to
 
01:54:27.430 --> 01:54:27.440 align:start position:0%
increase a small amount in the margins
 
01:54:29.030 --> 01:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
but kind of where we're going to make
 
01:54:31.069 --> 01:54:31.079 align:start position:0%
significant Investments uh in our
 
01:54:32.990 --> 01:54:33.000 align:start position:0%
adequacy formula for special education
 
01:54:34.870 --> 01:54:34.880 align:start position:0%
services I'm happy to answer any
 
01:54:36.390 --> 01:54:36.400 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much are there
 
01:54:37.910 --> 01:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
01:54:40.310 --> 01:54:40.320 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing any thank you very
 
01:54:42.589 --> 01:54:42.599 align:start position:0%
much thank you uh next card here in the
 
01:54:45.750 --> 01:54:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:47.990 --> 01:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
Eaton Brian are you coming up here from
 
01:54:50.069 --> 01:54:50.079 align:start position:0%
the Department uh with technical
 
01:54:52.550 --> 01:54:52.560 align:start position:0%
question to answer technical things are
 
01:54:54.629 --> 01:54:54.639 align:start position:0%
you presenting something as well I'm not
 
01:54:55.830 --> 01:54:55.840 align:start position:0%
presenting anything just want to provide
 
01:54:57.350 --> 01:54:57.360 align:start position:0%
insight to uh representative Luna's
 
01:54:59.750 --> 01:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
question about the EFA figures used okay
 
01:55:01.270 --> 01:55:01.280 align:start position:0%
go ahead sure my name is brany and I'm
 
01:55:02.629 --> 01:55:02.639 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Education Bureau
 
01:55:05.510 --> 01:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
of school Finance um I did not provide
 
01:55:07.510 --> 01:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
all the estimate figures in this fiscal
 
01:55:09.109 --> 01:55:09.119 align:start position:0%
note so I apologize I might not be able
 
01:55:11.629 --> 01:55:11.639 align:start position:0%
to provide 100% insight to it um what I
 
01:55:14.109 --> 01:55:14.119 align:start position:0%
do know is that the 400 uh figure for
 
01:55:15.990 --> 01:55:16.000 align:start position:0%
the EFA students receiving special
 
01:55:19.990 --> 01:55:20.000 align:start position:0%
education services for FY 26 was a 6% of
 
01:55:22.189 --> 01:55:22.199 align:start position:0%
the the total estimated EFA students for
 
01:55:24.950 --> 01:55:24.960 align:start position:0%
that that fiscal year so it's a 6% um
 
01:55:27.470 --> 01:55:27.480 align:start position:0%
ratio of uh special education students
 
01:55:28.870 --> 01:55:28.880 align:start position:0%
uh in the EFA program I believe that's
 
01:55:31.030 --> 01:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
based off of historically how the EFA
 
01:55:34.990 --> 01:55:35.000 align:start position:0%
program has been um being done so far so
 
01:55:37.030 --> 01:55:37.040 align:start position:0%
okay so do you have a question you might
 
01:55:38.790 --> 01:55:38.800 align:start position:0%
ask one we talked about just a few
 
01:55:41.069 --> 01:55:41.079 align:start position:0%
months it is sort of getting at getting
 
01:55:44.229 --> 01:55:44.239 align:start position:0%
at that so so thank you so so I just
 
01:55:47.790 --> 01:55:47.800 align:start position:0%
want to be very very specific um because
 
01:55:49.470 --> 01:55:49.480 align:start position:0%
these are fiscal notes they're supposed
 
01:55:52.390 --> 01:55:52.400 align:start position:0%
to be specific it says 400 receiving
 
01:55:56.310 --> 01:55:56.320 align:start position:0%
special education services or these 400
 
01:55:59.990 --> 01:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
receiving the um an EFA that contains
 
01:56:03.069 --> 01:56:03.079 align:start position:0%
the differentiated Aid Factor laid out
 
01:56:03.079 --> 01:56:04.950 align:start position:0%
the differentiated Aid Factor laid out
in

01:56:04.950 --> 01:56:04.960 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:56:07.550 --> 01:56:07.560 align:start position:0%
1984a that would be correct it' be 400
 
01:56:10.109 --> 01:56:10.119 align:start position:0%
estimated ADM for EFA students in fiscal
 
01:56:14.030 --> 01:56:14.040 align:start position:0%
year 26 following the same IEP yeah okay
 
01:56:17.750 --> 01:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
and follow go ahead no no so we yeah so
 
01:56:21.229 --> 01:56:21.239 align:start position:0%
so so we don't know the services they
 
01:56:23.390 --> 01:56:23.400 align:start position:0%
receiving we do know that the funding
 
01:56:25.430 --> 01:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
they're receiving is has that
 
01:56:28.669 --> 01:56:28.679 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid in there um did you
 
01:56:31.229 --> 01:56:31.239 align:start position:0%
say the 400 is an estimate or is that
 
01:56:34.390 --> 01:56:34.400 align:start position:0%
the number in the current year that
 
01:56:36.270 --> 01:56:36.280 align:start position:0%
would be the estimate for FY 26 because
 
01:56:39.030 --> 01:56:39.040 align:start position:0%
currently uh fy2 is the current school
 
01:56:41.709 --> 01:56:41.719 align:start position:0%
year for EFA students so fi 26 would be
 
01:56:43.950 --> 01:56:43.960 align:start position:0%
school year 26 EFA students okay and
 
01:56:45.750 --> 01:56:45.760 align:start position:0%
then and then the final question which I
 
01:56:48.430 --> 01:56:48.440 align:start position:0%
think is getting to what chair lad and I
 
01:56:51.950 --> 01:56:51.960 align:start position:0%
were talking about um did these students
 
01:56:54.109 --> 01:56:54.119 align:start position:0%
have or or I guess um let me say it
 
01:56:57.669 --> 01:56:57.679 align:start position:0%
another way um how did these students
 
01:57:01.750 --> 01:57:01.760 align:start position:0%
get um qualified for the special
 
01:57:05.510 --> 01:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
education differentiated Aid factor I
 
01:57:07.270 --> 01:57:07.280 align:start position:0%
can't speak 100% to that I believe it
 
01:57:09.229 --> 01:57:09.239 align:start position:0%
would be through combination of students
 
01:57:11.990 --> 01:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
identify special education through uh
 
01:57:13.910 --> 01:57:13.920 align:start position:0%
whether it's regular districts reporting
 
01:57:15.470 --> 01:57:15.480 align:start position:0%
the information through through uh the
 
01:57:17.149 --> 01:57:17.159 align:start position:0%
state reporting system or it's the
 
01:57:18.950 --> 01:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
children's scholarship fund identifying
 
01:57:20.550 --> 01:57:20.560 align:start position:0%
those students as receiving or eligible
 
01:57:22.830 --> 01:57:22.840 align:start position:0%
to receive special education uh services
 
01:57:24.109 --> 01:57:24.119 align:start position:0%
and then they mark them as special
 
01:57:26.030 --> 01:57:26.040 align:start position:0%
education through their reporting so in
 
01:57:28.109 --> 01:57:28.119 align:start position:0%
the ladder how does that happen I can't
 
01:57:29.950 --> 01:57:29.960 align:start position:0%
speak to that I'm sorry that be directed
 
01:57:32.030 --> 01:57:32.040 align:start position:0%
to maybe kin Davis who's now overseeing
 
01:57:34.149 --> 01:57:34.159 align:start position:0%
the the program
 
01:57:38.550 --> 01:57:38.560 align:start position:0%
okay that that's sort of uh my question
 
01:57:41.510 --> 01:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
is do the students have
 
01:57:44.550 --> 01:57:44.560 align:start position:0%
IEPs I believe so I would probably defer
 
01:57:47.470 --> 01:57:47.480 align:start position:0%
that Che with your director and folks
 
01:57:49.990 --> 01:57:50.000 align:start position:0%
and let us know please absolutely
 
01:57:53.229 --> 01:57:53.239 align:start position:0%
yes repon mahen
 
01:57:54.669 --> 01:57:54.679 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
01:57:56.709 --> 01:57:56.719 align:start position:0%
question I um I'm just wondering if
 
01:57:58.629 --> 01:57:58.639 align:start position:0%
there's if you've given any thought
 
01:58:01.030 --> 01:58:01.040 align:start position:0%
having heard the talk the talk of this
 
01:58:04.350 --> 01:58:04.360 align:start position:0%
being the cap so up to 29,000 so that
 
01:58:05.950 --> 01:58:05.960 align:start position:0%
some students who do not need anywhere
 
01:58:07.550 --> 01:58:07.560 align:start position:0%
near as much would not be get would be
 
01:58:09.390 --> 01:58:09.400 align:start position:0%
getting exactly what they need and no
 
01:58:10.950 --> 01:58:10.960 align:start position:0%
more is there any way that you could
 
01:58:13.430 --> 01:58:13.440 align:start position:0%
give like an estimate of how the cost
 
01:58:16.069 --> 01:58:16.079 align:start position:0%
would would be
 
01:58:19.270 --> 01:58:19.280 align:start position:0%
mitigated I don't believe uh not today I
 
01:58:20.910 --> 01:58:20.920 align:start position:0%
don't believe that we proba have to uh
 
01:58:22.870 --> 01:58:22.880 align:start position:0%
consult with the other individuals at
 
01:58:24.310 --> 01:58:24.320 align:start position:0%
Department in terms of how we could
 
01:58:26.550 --> 01:58:26.560 align:start position:0%
collect the data to actually be able to
 
01:58:28.350 --> 01:58:28.360 align:start position:0%
estimate the amount of services whether
 
01:58:30.669 --> 01:58:30.679 align:start position:0%
it's through data already being reported
 
01:58:32.310 --> 01:58:32.320 align:start position:0%
through the to the federal government or
 
01:58:33.910 --> 01:58:33.920 align:start position:0%
we'd have to collect additional data I
 
01:58:35.910 --> 01:58:35.920 align:start position:0%
can't speak to that 100% I
 
01:58:39.629 --> 01:58:39.639 align:start position:0%
apologize thank you representative bows
 
01:58:41.750 --> 01:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
and then yes um thank you um since
 
01:58:43.390 --> 01:58:43.400 align:start position:0%
you're going back to the department and
 
01:58:44.830 --> 01:58:44.840 align:start position:0%
you're going to bring back some
 
01:58:47.189 --> 01:58:47.199 align:start position:0%
information to us could you also please
 
01:58:51.310 --> 01:58:51.320 align:start position:0%
find out if when a EFA student gets the
 
01:58:54.990 --> 01:58:55.000 align:start position:0%
money for being specialed if it's um can
 
01:58:58.390 --> 01:58:58.400 align:start position:0%
only be spent on special ed services
 
01:59:00.950 --> 01:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
because we heard the other day that a
 
01:59:03.390 --> 01:59:03.400 align:start position:0%
student enrolled in a school private
 
01:59:07.109 --> 01:59:07.119 align:start position:0%
school had IEP and that the the school
 
01:59:10.430 --> 01:59:10.440 align:start position:0%
was not able to give them the service
 
01:59:13.109 --> 01:59:13.119 align:start position:0%
that was in their IEP yeah I I don't
 
01:59:14.669 --> 01:59:14.679 align:start position:0%
know the answer to that but yes we can
 
01:59:16.589 --> 01:59:16.599 align:start position:0%
provide that uh tomorrow for the work
 
01:59:18.390 --> 01:59:18.400 align:start position:0%
session thank you further questions was
 
01:59:21.069 --> 01:59:21.079 align:start position:0%
representative Damon thank you Mr chair
 
01:59:23.149 --> 01:59:23.159 align:start position:0%
thank you for helping us with the
 
01:59:26.510 --> 01:59:26.520 align:start position:0%
so in regards to the question of making
 
01:59:30.229 --> 01:59:30.239 align:start position:0%
this 29,000 figure a
 
01:59:33.030 --> 01:59:33.040 align:start position:0%
cap would it be correct that since this
 
01:59:36.830 --> 01:59:36.840 align:start position:0%
is the average true cost of or true
 
01:59:39.030 --> 01:59:39.040 align:start position:0%
additional cost of special education
 
01:59:40.709 --> 01:59:40.719 align:start position:0%
over the base
 
01:59:43.950 --> 01:59:43.960 align:start position:0%
adequacy if you cap it at the average
 
01:59:45.870 --> 01:59:45.880 align:start position:0%
then you are
 
01:59:48.750 --> 01:59:48.760 align:start position:0%
underfunding the students whose costs
 
01:59:50.589 --> 01:59:50.599 align:start position:0%
are greater than average would that be
 
01:59:50.599 --> 01:59:52.950 align:start position:0%
are greater than average would that be
correct

01:59:52.950 --> 01:59:52.960 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:59:55.390 --> 01:59:55.400 align:start position:0%
yes that that would be through doesn't
 
01:59:57.390 --> 01:59:57.400 align:start position:0%
as adequately address the object object
 
01:59:59.310 --> 01:59:59.320 align:start position:0%
objectively that would be how that
 
02:00:01.830 --> 02:00:01.840 align:start position:0%
formula would work out yes thank you
 
02:00:04.990 --> 02:00:05.000 align:start position:0%
further questions thank you very much
 
02:00:09.149 --> 02:00:09.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:11.709 --> 02:00:11.719 align:start position:0%
stemman question is like asking can you
 
02:00:19.350 --> 02:00:19.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:22.950 --> 02:00:22.960 align:start position:0%
is pleas
 
02:00:25.310 --> 02:00:25.320 align:start position:0%
here we go thank you my name is Lisa
 
02:00:27.910 --> 02:00:27.920 align:start position:0%
stemman I am a resident of the town of
 
02:00:31.189 --> 02:00:31.199 align:start position:0%
Troy I am the mom of a 13-year-old boy
 
02:00:32.629 --> 02:00:32.639 align:start position:0%
with Down syndrome and I've been a
 
02:00:35.189 --> 02:00:35.199 align:start position:0%
school board member for 15 years so I
 
02:00:37.149 --> 02:00:37.159 align:start position:0%
have the unique perspective of being
 
02:00:39.390 --> 02:00:39.400 align:start position:0%
able to see the pain of financing and
 
02:00:40.870 --> 02:00:40.880 align:start position:0%
educ education for students with
 
02:00:43.390 --> 02:00:43.400 align:start position:0%
disabilities from both sides and think
 
02:00:46.270 --> 02:00:46.280 align:start position:0%
about how it applies to my family uh I'm
 
02:00:48.550 --> 02:00:48.560 align:start position:0%
speaking to you as Max's mom
 
02:00:51.030 --> 02:00:51.040 align:start position:0%
today the challenge is that students
 
02:00:54.149 --> 02:00:54.159 align:start position:0%
requiring uh special education cost more
 
02:00:55.910 --> 02:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
and people in our own neighborhoods pay
 
02:00:58.669 --> 02:00:58.679 align:start position:0%
that cost when families like mine move
 
02:01:00.669 --> 02:01:00.679 align:start position:0%
into a neighborhood we bring the expense
 
02:01:02.790 --> 02:01:02.800 align:start position:0%
with us and that can be an unpleasant
 
02:01:05.069 --> 02:01:05.079 align:start position:0%
surprise for the new town or District
 
02:01:08.790 --> 02:01:08.800 align:start position:0%
which is required to accommodate
 
02:01:11.390 --> 02:01:11.400 align:start position:0%
immediately so the cost comes as a
 
02:01:15.669 --> 02:01:15.679 align:start position:0%
surprise um the stigma follows us and
 
02:01:17.629 --> 02:01:17.639 align:start position:0%
you may not think that that is a thing
 
02:01:19.790 --> 02:01:19.800 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire and that
 
02:01:22.189 --> 02:01:22.199 align:start position:0%
families feel that but I truly do feel
 
02:01:26.750 --> 02:01:26.760 align:start position:0%
it I I feel um I feel targeted sometimes
 
02:01:30.149 --> 02:01:30.159 align:start position:0%
and unwanted and I I feel like the the
 
02:01:32.229 --> 02:01:32.239 align:start position:0%
values that my family and I bring to a
 
02:01:35.270 --> 02:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
new town um might be undermined by the
 
02:01:37.270 --> 02:01:37.280 align:start position:0%
fact that we're also bringing with us an
 
02:01:42.109 --> 02:01:42.119 align:start position:0%
expense um just two days ago a budget
 
02:01:43.870 --> 02:01:43.880 align:start position:0%
Committee Member from one of our local
 
02:01:46.870 --> 02:01:46.880 align:start position:0%
towns uh asked if school districts can
 
02:01:49.390 --> 02:01:49.400 align:start position:0%
put up a No Vacancy sign when they've
 
02:01:51.229 --> 02:01:51.239 align:start position:0%
had enough special special education
 
02:01:51.239 --> 02:01:53.149 align:start position:0%
had enough special special education
students

02:01:53.149 --> 02:01:53.159 align:start position:0%
students
 
02:01:55.390 --> 02:01:55.400 align:start position:0%
this was recorded it's in their
 
02:01:58.910 --> 02:01:58.920 align:start position:0%
minutes um there was another person at a
 
02:02:01.990 --> 02:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
similar meeting who asked uh who said
 
02:02:04.709 --> 02:02:04.719 align:start position:0%
that uh the the moral and ethical thing
 
02:02:07.470 --> 02:02:07.480 align:start position:0%
to do is to ask the community to gift
 
02:02:10.430 --> 02:02:10.440 align:start position:0%
money for your child's needs so that the
 
02:02:12.950 --> 02:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
district doesn't have to pay for it this
 
02:02:15.350 --> 02:02:15.360 align:start position:0%
stuff happens and families like mine
 
02:02:18.709 --> 02:02:18.719 align:start position:0%
feel it I think the solution to this is
 
02:02:20.430 --> 02:02:20.440 align:start position:0%
to provide more money that consistently
 
02:02:23.030 --> 02:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
follows the child
 
02:02:25.629 --> 02:02:25.639 align:start position:0%
um we can't rely on catastrophic Aid or
 
02:02:28.510 --> 02:02:28.520 align:start position:0%
special education funding because it's
 
02:02:31.430 --> 02:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
uh it's a never growing pot of money
 
02:02:33.950 --> 02:02:33.960 align:start position:0%
that is meant for an Ever growing number
 
02:02:33.960 --> 02:02:34.910 align:start position:0%
that is meant for an Ever growing number
of

02:02:34.910 --> 02:02:34.920 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:02:38.629 --> 02:02:38.639 align:start position:0%
children um so I think that if we do
 
02:02:40.310 --> 02:02:40.320 align:start position:0%
provide money that follows the student
 
02:02:42.310 --> 02:02:42.320 align:start position:0%
from District to District uh the
 
02:02:44.069 --> 02:02:44.079 align:start position:0%
districts can be more welcoming they'll
 
02:02:45.950 --> 02:02:45.960 align:start position:0%
feel less overwhelmed when they have a
 
02:02:47.910 --> 02:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
new student who moves in there will be
 
02:02:50.109 --> 02:02:50.119 align:start position:0%
less stigma and Division and we can go
 
02:02:52.470 --> 02:02:52.480 align:start position:0%
back to just being Neighbors
 
02:02:54.629 --> 02:02:54.639 align:start position:0%
so I would like to ask for you to vote
 
02:02:57.470 --> 02:02:57.480 align:start position:0%
in favor of this Bill thank you very
 
02:02:59.910 --> 02:02:59.920 align:start position:0%

02:03:02.310 --> 02:03:02.320 align:start position:0%

many hats uh I'm a teacher in conquer I

teach at conquered high school and I
 
02:03:33.109 --> 02:03:33.119 align:start position:0%
also graduated from conquered High
 
02:03:35.430 --> 02:03:35.440 align:start position:0%
School uh I'm the 2018 New Hampshire
 
02:03:37.550 --> 02:03:37.560 align:start position:0%
teacher of the year I'm a resident of
 
02:03:39.390 --> 02:03:39.400 align:start position:0%
conquer and I also the mother of three
 
02:03:41.310 --> 02:03:41.320 align:start position:0%
public school students and I'm really
 
02:03:43.870 --> 02:03:43.880 align:start position:0%
here more with my mothering hat where I
 
02:03:46.629 --> 02:03:46.639 align:start position:0%
will dovetail in my teacher in hat um I
 
02:03:47.950 --> 02:03:47.960 align:start position:0%
wasn't even going to speak today I was
 
02:03:49.870 --> 02:03:49.880 align:start position:0%
just here I took a personal day for
 
02:03:54.030 --> 02:03:54.040 align:start position:0%
another um need and so I thought I'd pop
 
02:03:56.229 --> 02:03:56.239 align:start position:0%
on over and listen to some testimony and
 
02:03:58.750 --> 02:03:58.760 align:start position:0%
I couldn't keep my mouth shut um the
 
02:04:00.229 --> 02:04:00.239 align:start position:0%
reason that I wanted to share my a
 
02:04:02.790 --> 02:04:02.800 align:start position:0%
little bit of a story is just that um I
 
02:04:05.149 --> 02:04:05.159 align:start position:0%
have three three daughters and two of
 
02:04:08.270 --> 02:04:08.280 align:start position:0%
them do receive um special education
 
02:04:10.589 --> 02:04:10.599 align:start position:0%
services and they're sort of interesting
 
02:04:13.750 --> 02:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
because they do not have um extenuating
 
02:04:15.870 --> 02:04:15.880 align:start position:0%
um incredibly expensive needs they're
 
02:04:18.589 --> 02:04:18.599 align:start position:0%
sort of your typical um need and our
 
02:04:20.390 --> 02:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
goal for them is as others were
 
02:04:22.750 --> 02:04:22.760 align:start position:0%
previously talking is that we give them
 
02:04:24.390 --> 02:04:24.400 align:start position:0%
the specialized instruction that they
 
02:04:26.629 --> 02:04:26.639 align:start position:0%
need when they need it in the in their
 
02:04:28.030 --> 02:04:28.040 align:start position:0%
classroom so that eventually they're not
 
02:04:29.310 --> 02:04:29.320 align:start position:0%
going to need those anymore because
 
02:04:30.950 --> 02:04:30.960 align:start position:0%
they'll have the tools and they will
 
02:04:33.669 --> 02:04:33.679 align:start position:0%
have grown their skill set and I think
 
02:04:35.790 --> 02:04:35.800 align:start position:0%
what empowers me to speak in support of
 
02:04:38.870 --> 02:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
this bill is that when we Empower school
 
02:04:42.589 --> 02:04:42.599 align:start position:0%
districts to give their to be able to
 
02:04:44.390 --> 02:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
give their students what they know they
 
02:04:46.589 --> 02:04:46.599 align:start position:0%
need um whether they are special
 
02:04:48.549 --> 02:04:48.559 align:start position:0%
education or not but unfortunately as
 
02:04:50.669 --> 02:04:50.679 align:start position:0%
the previous woman has spoken um we
 
02:04:53.310 --> 02:04:53.320 align:start position:0%
target special for how much costs but
 
02:04:55.390 --> 02:04:55.400 align:start position:0%
when we provide our schools with the
 
02:04:57.149 --> 02:04:57.159 align:start position:0%
resources that they need which they
 
02:04:59.310 --> 02:04:59.320 align:start position:0%
don't currently have then we Empower
 
02:05:00.629 --> 02:05:00.639 align:start position:0%
them to be able to do what is best for
 
02:05:02.870 --> 02:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
their students instead of labeling them
 
02:05:05.629 --> 02:05:05.639 align:start position:0%
as oh the expensive kid just moved in it
 
02:05:07.669 --> 02:05:07.679 align:start position:0%
won't matter and so I think sometimes
 
02:05:10.390 --> 02:05:10.400 align:start position:0%
our conversation becomes so heightened
 
02:05:12.310 --> 02:05:12.320 align:start position:0%
when we say oh these kinds of kids are
 
02:05:14.470 --> 02:05:14.480 align:start position:0%
costing us money no they're all our
 
02:05:18.189 --> 02:05:18.199 align:start position:0%
students and the foundational uh value
 
02:05:20.990 --> 02:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
of a public school is that we are
 
02:05:23.549 --> 02:05:23.559 align:start position:0%
committed to educating and servicing and
 
02:05:25.270 --> 02:05:25.280 align:start position:0%
helping whoever comes through the front
 
02:05:27.149 --> 02:05:27.159 align:start position:0%
door and there is no other institution
 
02:05:28.589 --> 02:05:28.599 align:start position:0%
in this state or in this country that
 
02:05:30.470 --> 02:05:30.480 align:start position:0%
commits to doing that and so if we're
 
02:05:32.910 --> 02:05:32.920 align:start position:0%
going to make that commitment then we
 
02:05:34.430 --> 02:05:34.440 align:start position:0%
also need to empower our schools to be
 
02:05:36.950 --> 02:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
able to do that and empowerment comes
 
02:05:39.870 --> 02:05:39.880 align:start position:0%
with I mean money is what empowers them
 
02:05:41.870 --> 02:05:41.880 align:start position:0%
and so as a mother I'm incredibly
 
02:05:43.870 --> 02:05:43.880 align:start position:0%
grateful that my daughters are going are
 
02:05:45.790 --> 02:05:45.800 align:start position:0%
getting what they need and they have
 
02:05:49.069 --> 02:05:49.079 align:start position:0%
blossomed um they uh you wouldn't even
 
02:05:50.589 --> 02:05:50.599 align:start position:0%
probably know looking at them that they
 
02:05:53.549 --> 02:05:53.559 align:start position:0%
need that extra support support um and
 
02:05:56.709 --> 02:05:56.719 align:start position:0%
it's because their school was empowered
 
02:05:58.629 --> 02:05:58.639 align:start position:0%
to be able to do what it needed and I
 
02:06:00.669 --> 02:06:00.679 align:start position:0%
think every school in this state
 
02:06:02.310 --> 02:06:02.320 align:start position:0%
regardless of the ZIP code should be
 
02:06:05.310 --> 02:06:05.320 align:start position:0%
able to do that so thank you thank you
 
02:06:09.510 --> 02:06:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:11.830 --> 02:06:11.840 align:start position:0%
Heidi thank you for taking and using
 
02:06:13.629 --> 02:06:13.639 align:start position:0%
your personal day to come in and do that
 
02:06:14.709 --> 02:06:14.719 align:start position:0%
oh my
 
02:06:18.310 --> 02:06:18.320 align:start position:0%
pleasure thank you uh next person is
 
02:06:36.549 --> 02:06:36.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:38.109 --> 02:06:38.119 align:start position:0%
morning Mr chairman and committee
 
02:06:39.870 --> 02:06:39.880 align:start position:0%
members I stand in support of this bill
 
02:06:41.950 --> 02:06:41.960 align:start position:0%
for three reasons first is I'd like to
 
02:06:43.310 --> 02:06:43.320 align:start position:0%
start with the concept of the
 
02:06:45.629 --> 02:06:45.639 align:start position:0%
presumption of competence oftentimes
 
02:06:47.310 --> 02:06:47.320 align:start position:0%
when special ed is discussed the
 
02:06:50.470 --> 02:06:50.480 align:start position:0%
question is is this money important and
 
02:06:53.189 --> 02:06:53.199 align:start position:0%
it is important uh individually these
 
02:06:55.669 --> 02:06:55.679 align:start position:0%
students have the right to a free and
 
02:06:57.629 --> 02:06:57.639 align:start position:0%
appropriate education but more than that
 
02:06:59.990 --> 02:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
in addition to that rather it also has a
 
02:07:02.350 --> 02:07:02.360 align:start position:0%
return in investment in for society an
 
02:07:04.709 --> 02:07:04.719 align:start position:0%
odd thing happened in Texas in 2005 the
 
02:07:08.069 --> 02:07:08.079 align:start position:0%
state decided that only 88.5% of their
 
02:07:10.390 --> 02:07:10.400 align:start position:0%
children needed and would receive
 
02:07:12.109 --> 02:07:12.119 align:start position:0%
special education services they just
 
02:07:13.950 --> 02:07:13.960 align:start position:0%
picked that number so obviously there's
 
02:07:15.069 --> 02:07:15.079 align:start position:0%
more than
 
02:07:17.189 --> 02:07:17.199 align:start position:0%
88.5% eventually the Department of
 
02:07:20.310 --> 02:07:20.320 align:start position:0%
Justice sued overturned that and
 
02:07:21.790 --> 02:07:21.800 align:start position:0%
everybody started getting the service
 
02:07:23.549 --> 02:07:23.559 align:start position:0%
but this created this sort of like
 
02:07:26.270 --> 02:07:26.280 align:start position:0%
control group for scientific researchers
 
02:07:28.589 --> 02:07:28.599 align:start position:0%
to say what happens when you lose
 
02:07:30.990 --> 02:07:31.000 align:start position:0%
special education services and there's a
 
02:07:33.830 --> 02:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
report it's in my uh testimony there
 
02:07:35.310 --> 02:07:35.320 align:start position:0%
from two professors and it's in the
 
02:07:37.270 --> 02:07:37.280 align:start position:0%
American Economic Journal what they
 
02:07:39.270 --> 02:07:39.280 align:start position:0%
concluded was that the absence of
 
02:07:41.310 --> 02:07:41.320 align:start position:0%
special ed services can reduce the
 
02:07:44.310 --> 02:07:44.320 align:start position:0%
likelihood of finishing High School by
 
02:07:46.750 --> 02:07:46.760 align:start position:0%
52% and reduce the likelihood of going
 
02:07:49.149 --> 02:07:49.159 align:start position:0%
to college by 38% and the reason for
 
02:07:51.510 --> 02:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
that is because of the extensive in
 
02:07:53.830 --> 02:07:53.840 align:start position:0%
intensive services that students receive
 
02:07:56.149 --> 02:07:56.159 align:start position:0%
in the general classroom or sometimes
 
02:07:57.629 --> 02:07:57.639 align:start position:0%
not in but the teachers AIDS and their
 
02:08:00.310 --> 02:08:00.320 align:start position:0%
par professionals so this education is
 
02:08:02.589 --> 02:08:02.599 align:start position:0%
not only a legal right it actually is
 
02:08:05.229 --> 02:08:05.239 align:start position:0%
beneficial to society the second thing
 
02:08:07.589 --> 02:08:07.599 align:start position:0%
is the question here really about this
 
02:08:10.149 --> 02:08:10.159 align:start position:0%
bill is what should be the state's share
 
02:08:12.910 --> 02:08:12.920 align:start position:0%
of this right now the state's paying 11%
 
02:08:14.470 --> 02:08:14.480 align:start position:0%
the money's already being spent as
 
02:08:16.669 --> 02:08:16.679 align:start position:0%
several people have said the problem
 
02:08:19.030 --> 02:08:19.040 align:start position:0%
with the state only paying 11% is that
 
02:08:20.950 --> 02:08:20.960 align:start position:0%
it puts an undue pressure on local
 
02:08:23.149 --> 02:08:23.159 align:start position:0%
community which leads to the story you
 
02:08:25.470 --> 02:08:25.480 align:start position:0%
just heard the stigma against parents it
 
02:08:27.149 --> 02:08:27.159 align:start position:0%
leads to the problem in do where they
 
02:08:28.669 --> 02:08:28.679 align:start position:0%
don't have the money to put in place a
 
02:08:31.750 --> 02:08:31.760 align:start position:0%
good long-term solution so the state's
 
02:08:35.229 --> 02:08:35.239 align:start position:0%
failure to adequately fund creates new
 
02:08:37.549 --> 02:08:37.559 align:start position:0%
problems if you provide that funding at
 
02:08:39.390 --> 02:08:39.400 align:start position:0%
the state level you remove those
 
02:08:41.149 --> 02:08:41.159 align:start position:0%
problems even if the total money doesn't
 
02:08:43.430 --> 02:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
go up you eliminate the stigma you allow
 
02:08:45.510 --> 02:08:45.520 align:start position:0%
towns to manage and operate their
 
02:08:47.669 --> 02:08:47.679 align:start position:0%
businesses in a sensible intelligent
 
02:08:50.189 --> 02:08:50.199 align:start position:0%
fashion the only then last objection is
 
02:08:51.549 --> 02:08:51.559 align:start position:0%
what do you do about the windfall for
 
02:08:54.589 --> 02:08:54.599 align:start position:0%
the students who don't cost $29,000 if
 
02:08:56.790 --> 02:08:56.800 align:start position:0%
as you've asked a couple of times so
 
02:08:58.270 --> 02:08:58.280 align:start position:0%
remember you've got two parts to the
 
02:09:00.830 --> 02:09:00.840 align:start position:0%
formula the the differential Aid and you
 
02:09:02.790 --> 02:09:02.800 align:start position:0%
got the catastrophic Aid part so you
 
02:09:06.229 --> 02:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
could cap the differential Aid at 29,000
 
02:09:08.109 --> 02:09:08.119 align:start position:0%
but then what you could do is say now
 
02:09:09.870 --> 02:09:09.880 align:start position:0%
we're going to fix the catastrophic Aid
 
02:09:12.589 --> 02:09:12.599 align:start position:0%
part any student who receives more than
 
02:09:14.910 --> 02:09:14.920 align:start position:0%
$29,000 in services to address
 
02:09:17.189 --> 02:09:17.199 align:start position:0%
representative Damon's question we would
 
02:09:19.709 --> 02:09:19.719 align:start position:0%
no longer wait for them to get to 75,000
 
02:09:21.950 --> 02:09:21.960 align:start position:0%
and only pay 80% we would would jump in
 
02:09:24.069 --> 02:09:24.079 align:start position:0%
and pay all of it or most of it or
 
02:09:26.109 --> 02:09:26.119 align:start position:0%
whatever percentage that you would graph
 
02:09:27.870 --> 02:09:27.880 align:start position:0%
it out on the chart to figure it out you
 
02:09:29.629 --> 02:09:29.639 align:start position:0%
would pay for those people so you would
 
02:09:32.270 --> 02:09:32.280 align:start position:0%
not have an underfunding situation so if
 
02:09:34.390 --> 02:09:34.400 align:start position:0%
you combine the two of them so what
 
02:09:36.270 --> 02:09:36.280 align:start position:0%
basically what I'm saying is is instead
 
02:09:38.470 --> 02:09:38.480 align:start position:0%
of worrying about the dollar month if
 
02:09:40.750 --> 02:09:40.760 align:start position:0%
the committee says we are committed as a
 
02:09:42.950 --> 02:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
state legislature to increasing the
 
02:09:46.709 --> 02:09:46.719 align:start position:0%
state's share from 11% to whatever
 
02:09:49.390 --> 02:09:49.400 align:start position:0%
number you pick this year let's say 20%
 
02:09:51.390 --> 02:09:51.400 align:start position:0%
this year then the next bium you go to
 
02:09:53.750 --> 02:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
40% the next you go to 60 then 80 then
 
02:09:55.669 --> 02:09:55.679 align:start position:0%
you get to 100 just like you did with
 
02:09:58.109 --> 02:09:58.119 align:start position:0%
differenti the stabilization fund you
 
02:10:01.709 --> 02:10:01.719 align:start position:0%
cut it over five sections you eliminate
 
02:10:03.910 --> 02:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
that stabilization fund you could do the
 
02:10:05.830 --> 02:10:05.840 align:start position:0%
same thing with special ed increasing it
 
02:10:08.870 --> 02:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
20% per banial budget get to the final
 
02:10:10.629 --> 02:10:10.639 align:start position:0%
number that would give you some time to
 
02:10:13.310 --> 02:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
have doe fire those hire the people they
 
02:10:15.549 --> 02:10:15.559 align:start position:0%
need to figure out how to do it but the
 
02:10:17.430 --> 02:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
the key thing for you is are you willing
 
02:10:19.669 --> 02:10:19.679 align:start position:0%
to increase the state's share that's the
 
02:10:21.109 --> 02:10:21.119 align:start position:0%
ultimate question if the answer is yes
 
02:10:23.430 --> 02:10:23.440 align:start position:0%
you you can find a way to do it thank
 
02:10:25.510 --> 02:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much David are there
 
02:10:28.790 --> 02:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee na thank
 
02:10:30.990 --> 02:10:31.000 align:start position:0%
you very much you're welcome uh we have
 
02:10:33.549 --> 02:10:33.559 align:start position:0%
one card left and that's uh from the
 
02:10:35.030 --> 02:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
school boards Association Becky do you
 
02:10:37.109 --> 02:10:37.119 align:start position:0%
want to talk today or
 
02:10:39.030 --> 02:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
tomorrow thank you represent that's
 
02:10:41.189 --> 02:10:41.199 align:start position:0%
completely up to the committee if there
 
02:10:43.430 --> 02:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
are people from other agencies and
 
02:10:46.270 --> 02:10:46.280 align:start position:0%
departments here questions I was just
 
02:10:47.830 --> 02:10:47.840 align:start position:0%
offering than thank you very much I
 
02:10:49.830 --> 02:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
think we'll hold off on you then till
 
02:10:52.069 --> 02:10:52.079 align:start position:0%
tomorrow seeing that we have cat
 
02:10:53.750 --> 02:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
catastrophic Aid right on the docket
 
02:10:55.910 --> 02:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
here and we're running behind so with
 
02:10:58.149 --> 02:10:58.159 align:start position:0%
that I'm going to close this hearing and
 
02:11:02.750 --> 02:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
open up 7 17 that's the next bill that's
 
02:11:05.229 --> 02:11:05.239 align:start position:0%
yeah I got uh relative to catastrophic
 
02:11:10.149 --> 02:11:10.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:12.350 --> 02:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
education okay the chair is going to
 
02:11:14.990 --> 02:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
step down and uh appear before us since
 
02:11:32.709 --> 02:11:32.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:35.549 --> 02:11:35.559 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh Mr chair and
 
02:11:37.470 --> 02:11:37.480 align:start position:0%
members of the uh education funding
 
02:11:38.950 --> 02:11:38.960 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is Rick
 
02:11:41.549 --> 02:11:41.559 align:start position:0%
lad I come from hail and I'm here today
 
02:11:44.830 --> 02:11:44.840 align:start position:0%
to present uh HP 717 that relative to
 
02:11:47.350 --> 02:11:47.360 align:start position:0%
castrop aid for special education and
 
02:11:49.229 --> 02:11:49.239 align:start position:0%
we've heard some good testimony earlier
 
02:11:52.149 --> 02:11:52.159 align:start position:0%
this morning referencing the the other
 
02:11:54.510 --> 02:11:54.520 align:start position:0%
side of special ed within differentiate
 
02:11:56.910 --> 02:11:56.920 align:start position:0%
aid but we did touch at times upon the
 
02:11:59.189 --> 02:11:59.199 align:start position:0%
special education Aid which is
 
02:12:00.310 --> 02:12:00.320 align:start position:0%
associated with the old term
 
02:12:03.549 --> 02:12:03.559 align:start position:0%
catastrophic Aid um catastrophic Aid is
 
02:12:06.510 --> 02:12:06.520 align:start position:0%
another place where the state uh has
 
02:12:09.189 --> 02:12:09.199 align:start position:0%
participation along with the local
 
02:12:13.669 --> 02:12:13.679 align:start position:0%
school district however um this bill I
 
02:12:15.830 --> 02:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
presented right now that's just one
 
02:12:18.069 --> 02:12:18.079 align:start position:0%
thing to the catastrophic Aid and that
 
02:12:21.589 --> 02:12:21.599 align:start position:0%
just changes uh the formula around backs
 
02:12:24.790 --> 02:12:24.800 align:start position:0%
it off so the state does have a bit more
 
02:12:27.549 --> 02:12:27.559 align:start position:0%
involvement however it the primary
 
02:12:30.870 --> 02:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
purpose of this bill is for us to have a
 
02:12:34.589 --> 02:12:34.599 align:start position:0%
vehicle in which to further discuss that
 
02:12:36.470 --> 02:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
and obviously there's several vehicles
 
02:12:38.310 --> 02:12:38.320 align:start position:0%
that are coming into us on catastrophic
 
02:12:41.629 --> 02:12:41.639 align:start position:0%
Aid catastrophic Aid is set up based
 
02:12:43.270 --> 02:12:43.280 align:start position:0%
upon the first three and a half times
 
02:12:47.149 --> 02:12:47.159 align:start position:0%
the average per pupil cost is paid for
 
02:12:51.790 --> 02:12:51.800 align:start position:0%
by the Local District using $20,000 as a
 
02:12:54.270 --> 02:12:54.280 align:start position:0%
per pupil cost so you can see that the
 
02:12:56.910 --> 02:12:56.920 align:start position:0%
local district has to cough up
 
02:12:56.920 --> 02:12:58.870 align:start position:0%
local district has to cough up
$70,000

02:12:58.870 --> 02:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
$70,000
 
02:13:02.709 --> 02:13:02.719 align:start position:0%
first then from Seven that $70,000 from
 
02:13:07.310 --> 02:13:07.320 align:start position:0%
that three and half times to 10 times
 
02:13:10.910 --> 02:13:10.920 align:start position:0%
it's a split between not a split but the
 
02:13:13.910 --> 02:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
state takes over 80% of that
 
02:13:18.510 --> 02:13:18.520 align:start position:0%
cost and the school district takes up
 
02:13:22.069 --> 02:13:22.079 align:start position:0%
20% you had that 20% in with $70,000
 
02:13:24.310 --> 02:13:24.320 align:start position:0%
you're coming up close to $96,000 the
 
02:13:26.149 --> 02:13:26.159 align:start position:0%
district's going to have to cough up for
 
02:13:28.350 --> 02:13:28.360 align:start position:0%
getting to the top end of that
 
02:13:32.149 --> 02:13:32.159 align:start position:0%
scale we recognize this is to on the
 
02:13:34.510 --> 02:13:34.520 align:start position:0%
street this is the one area that I hear
 
02:13:37.030 --> 02:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
the most comments about is how we going
 
02:13:39.669 --> 02:13:39.679 align:start position:0%
to pay for special education it seems to
 
02:13:43.189 --> 02:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
be growing and growing and growing uh so
 
02:13:45.990 --> 02:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
I I I submitted this one as we have the
 
02:13:48.870 --> 02:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
other bills um trying to stay in
 
02:13:51.390 --> 02:13:51.400 align:start position:0%
compliance with federal law like the
 
02:13:53.709 --> 02:13:53.719 align:start position:0%
adequacy stuff yeah there is a portion
 
02:13:56.109 --> 02:13:56.119 align:start position:0%
of the federal law data fact sheet
 
02:13:58.950 --> 02:13:58.960 align:start position:0%
indicator five of the idea Part B which
 
02:14:01.270 --> 02:14:01.280 align:start position:0%
says those categories this one right
 
02:14:04.069 --> 02:14:04.079 align:start position:0%
here we have that obligation and so I
 
02:14:06.109 --> 02:14:06.119 align:start position:0%
would like us as a committee to be
 
02:14:08.030 --> 02:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
looking at this we need a work a work
 
02:14:11.430 --> 02:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
session on it and to help calculate how
 
02:14:13.950 --> 02:14:13.960 align:start position:0%
we going to support the the critical
 
02:14:16.310 --> 02:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
needs of these students that qualify for
 
02:14:18.790 --> 02:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
this area of
 
02:14:21.709 --> 02:14:21.719 align:start position:0%
Education I I'll take questions if you
 
02:14:23.470 --> 02:14:23.480 align:start position:0%
I'll lead with a question in a prior
 
02:14:25.510 --> 02:14:25.520 align:start position:0%
term I co-sponsored a bill that you were
 
02:14:27.350 --> 02:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor on then that would
 
02:14:29.870 --> 02:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
have reset the Threshold at two and a
 
02:14:31.589 --> 02:14:31.599 align:start position:0%
half times so it's my understanding
 
02:14:33.709 --> 02:14:33.719 align:start position:0%
you're not wed to three you're just
 
02:14:35.549 --> 02:14:35.559 align:start position:0%
trying to make sure we have a bill where
 
02:14:37.830 --> 02:14:37.840 align:start position:0%
we can calibrate what's appropriate yeah
 
02:14:39.189 --> 02:14:39.199 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of aspects thank you
 
02:14:41.750 --> 02:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
very much there are a lot of aspects to
 
02:14:45.430 --> 02:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
this portion of law we we have the
 
02:14:47.189 --> 02:14:47.199 align:start position:0%
amount that the state and the local
 
02:14:49.950 --> 02:14:49.960 align:start position:0%
contribute here we have the issue
 
02:14:53.470 --> 02:14:53.480 align:start position:0%
dealing with pration of dollars I was
 
02:14:55.149 --> 02:14:55.159 align:start position:0%
part of a bill even back when
 
02:14:56.990 --> 02:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
representative guile was chairing this
 
02:14:59.390 --> 02:14:59.400 align:start position:0%
committee the education committee and
 
02:15:01.910 --> 02:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
both of us were very very concerned with
 
02:15:04.350 --> 02:15:04.360 align:start position:0%
the pration the pration then we were
 
02:15:06.870 --> 02:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
were we had distributed for cat Aid back
 
02:15:11.430 --> 02:15:11.440 align:start position:0%
in that time $21.5 million
 
02:15:15.189 --> 02:15:15.199 align:start position:0%
fy13 the actual costs came in uh at
 
02:15:19.750 --> 02:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
around 34 excuse me not 34 but uh the
 
02:15:21.990 --> 02:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
the 21.5 was
 
02:15:25.750 --> 02:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
71.8% of the actual cost we have the
 
02:15:27.390 --> 02:15:27.400 align:start position:0%
same thing going on right now where we
 
02:15:30.189 --> 02:15:30.199 align:start position:0%
allocated 34 but we're over $51 million
 
02:15:33.629 --> 02:15:33.639 align:start position:0%
in actual cost and we're prating back to
 
02:15:36.990 --> 02:15:37.000 align:start position:0%
67% these are the the the costs which
 
02:15:39.549 --> 02:15:39.559 align:start position:0%
local districts cannot sustain they
 
02:15:42.830 --> 02:15:42.840 align:start position:0%
cannot sustain this going
 
02:15:45.390 --> 02:15:45.400 align:start position:0%
forward and yet they want to also
 
02:15:48.510 --> 02:15:48.520 align:start position:0%
provide the children that require
 
02:15:52.069 --> 02:15:52.079 align:start position:0%
Services the support that they need
 
02:15:53.910 --> 02:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
and we need to look at that as well to
 
02:15:55.790 --> 02:15:55.800 align:start position:0%
ensure that that support is being
 
02:15:58.950 --> 02:15:58.960 align:start position:0%
provided by the people delivering it
 
02:16:01.950 --> 02:16:01.960 align:start position:0%
there's a lot to this so I will close we
 
02:16:03.830 --> 02:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
go on we'll do it tomorrow and next day
 
02:16:07.990 --> 02:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
in the next day thank you any
 
02:16:11.149 --> 02:16:11.159 align:start position:0%
questions very good thank you we should
 
02:16:15.830 --> 02:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:19.030 --> 02:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
morning okay I have no uh Pink cards is
 
02:16:23.069 --> 02:16:23.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:26.030 --> 02:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
okay we do have
 
02:16:29.189 --> 02:16:29.199 align:start position:0%
one um so first I'm going to call
 
02:16:35.990 --> 02:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:38.110 --> 02:16:38.120 align:start position:0%
dry thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
02:16:40.030 --> 02:16:40.040 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
02:16:41.750 --> 02:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
I'm representative Margaret dry serving
 
02:16:45.389 --> 02:16:45.399 align:start position:0%
Sullivan district 7 Charlestown Unity
 
02:16:47.709 --> 02:16:47.719 align:start position:0%
Newport planfield and
 
02:16:50.549 --> 02:16:50.559 align:start position:0%
Cornish I have five towns in my float
 
02:16:50.559 --> 02:16:51.509 align:start position:0%
Cornish I have five towns in my float
District

02:16:51.509 --> 02:16:51.519 align:start position:0%
District
 
02:16:54.709 --> 02:16:54.719 align:start position:0%
but only two stop lights I have four of
 
02:16:57.190 --> 02:16:57.200 align:start position:0%
the five towns um don't even have a high
 
02:16:59.950 --> 02:16:59.960 align:start position:0%
school compared to other urban areas
 
02:17:02.830 --> 02:17:02.840 align:start position:0%
most of our school budgets are smaller
 
02:17:04.790 --> 02:17:04.800 align:start position:0%
and that makes it harder to come up with
 
02:17:06.509 --> 02:17:06.519 align:start position:0%
front money when we have extraordinary
 
02:17:08.030 --> 02:17:08.040 align:start position:0%
costs for special
 
02:17:10.990 --> 02:17:11.000 align:start position:0%
education and if it isn't refunded at
 
02:17:15.150 --> 02:17:15.160 align:start position:0%
the promised rate well that can be
 
02:17:17.950 --> 02:17:17.960 align:start position:0%
catastrophic and the price of special
 
02:17:20.549 --> 02:17:20.559 align:start position:0%
education isn't prated to a town school
 
02:17:20.559 --> 02:17:21.349 align:start position:0%
education isn't prated to a town school
budget

02:17:21.349 --> 02:17:21.359 align:start position:0%
budget
 
02:17:23.870 --> 02:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
it's the same number all the time so if
 
02:17:26.549 --> 02:17:26.559 align:start position:0%
it's not reimbursed totally as it was
 
02:17:29.270 --> 02:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
promised a large budget number takes a
 
02:17:32.030 --> 02:17:32.040 align:start position:0%
bigger bite out of a smaller District's
 
02:17:34.389 --> 02:17:34.399 align:start position:0%
budget so I have one problem with the
 
02:17:35.870 --> 02:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
this bill as it's written I know you're
 
02:17:38.070 --> 02:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
going to work on it tomorrow is lines 15
 
02:17:39.910 --> 02:17:39.920 align:start position:0%
through 18 where it talks about an extra
 
02:17:43.669 --> 02:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
fund for towns with a communities of a
 
02:17:47.549 --> 02:17:47.559 align:start position:0%
thousand people or less and I none of my
 
02:17:49.790 --> 02:17:49.800 align:start position:0%
towns fall into that category but you
 
02:17:51.709 --> 02:17:51.719 align:start position:0%
heard about my hometown a plane field in
 
02:17:54.110 --> 02:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
the last bill of the extraordinary educa
 
02:17:56.669 --> 02:17:56.679 align:start position:0%
special education cost up uh uptake from
 
02:17:59.110 --> 02:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
last year so I'm just want saying when
 
02:18:02.589 --> 02:18:02.599 align:start position:0%
you look at this maybe consider a larger
 
02:18:04.790 --> 02:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
number in the community or maybe just
 
02:18:06.469 --> 02:18:06.479 align:start position:0%
the size of their school budget rather
 
02:18:08.070 --> 02:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
than their
 
02:18:10.830 --> 02:18:10.840 align:start position:0%
population and finally if we don't meet
 
02:18:12.469 --> 02:18:12.479 align:start position:0%
our promises for reimbursement here in
 
02:18:12.479 --> 02:18:13.509 align:start position:0%
our promises for reimbursement here in
the

02:18:13.509 --> 02:18:13.519 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:18:16.709 --> 02:18:16.719 align:start position:0%
state we have no standing to Pro to
 
02:18:18.750 --> 02:18:18.760 align:start position:0%
approach our Congressional Delegation to
 
02:18:21.110 --> 02:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
ask them for full funding for special
 
02:18:24.070 --> 02:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
education at the federal level and which
 
02:18:25.709 --> 02:18:25.719 align:start position:0%
we all know doesn't even come close to
 
02:18:27.830 --> 02:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
the amount that they promise so on
 
02:18:29.349 --> 02:18:29.359 align:start position:0%
behalf of the districts I represent
 
02:18:31.509 --> 02:18:31.519 align:start position:0%
especially the small ones I'm asking you
 
02:18:34.270 --> 02:18:34.280 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we hold ourselves to
 
02:18:36.030 --> 02:18:36.040 align:start position:0%
what we've promised for reimbursing
 
02:18:38.389 --> 02:18:38.399 align:start position:0%
extraordinary costs thank
 
02:18:41.469 --> 02:18:41.479 align:start position:0%

represent either one I represent myself
 
02:19:26.830 --> 02:19:26.840 align:start position:0%
um I I would like to note it is
 
02:19:28.669 --> 02:19:28.679 align:start position:0%
challenging to represent your
 
02:19:31.790 --> 02:19:31.800 align:start position:0%
Schoolboard because these committees are
 
02:19:33.790 --> 02:19:33.800 align:start position:0%
um the schedules are put out a week in
 
02:19:35.309 --> 02:19:35.319 align:start position:0%
advance and when we don't have a
 
02:19:37.030 --> 02:19:37.040 align:start position:0%
Schoolboard meeting um on which we can
 
02:19:39.629 --> 02:19:39.639 align:start position:0%
do a public vote that is challenging um
 
02:19:42.429 --> 02:19:42.439 align:start position:0%
I I do know anecdotally the members of
 
02:19:45.509 --> 02:19:45.519 align:start position:0%
my school board um share my values in
 
02:19:47.509 --> 02:19:47.519 align:start position:0%
general um so without being specific I
 
02:19:50.389 --> 02:19:50.399 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure to to um to state
 
02:19:53.190 --> 02:19:53.200 align:start position:0%
that for the record uh I am speaking
 
02:19:55.190 --> 02:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
extemporaneously today I wasn't planning
 
02:19:57.469 --> 02:19:57.479 align:start position:0%
on speaking but I when I was reviewing
 
02:20:00.389 --> 02:20:00.399 align:start position:0%
the text of this bill last night I did
 
02:20:03.190 --> 02:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
uh I valued the um the attempt that
 
02:20:06.270 --> 02:20:06.280 align:start position:0%
representative lad is making to decrease
 
02:20:08.870 --> 02:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
the threshold after which catastrophic
 
02:20:11.830 --> 02:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
Aid now called special education Aid is
 
02:20:16.110 --> 02:20:16.120 align:start position:0%
um is put into effect I do agree that
 
02:20:18.150 --> 02:20:18.160 align:start position:0%
the uh reduction from three and 1 half
 
02:20:20.270 --> 02:20:20.280 align:start position:0%
times to three times is not nearly
 
02:20:20.280 --> 02:20:21.230 align:start position:0%
times to three times is not nearly
enough

02:20:21.230 --> 02:20:21.240 align:start position:0%
enough
 
02:20:23.750 --> 02:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh as we heard in the prior hearing the
 
02:20:25.910 --> 02:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
true cost the true additional cost of
 
02:20:27.750 --> 02:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
special education in New Hampshire is an
 
02:20:30.710 --> 02:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
average now um of over
 
02:20:33.630 --> 02:20:33.640 align:start position:0%
$31,000 so if we are looking at the
 
02:20:36.830 --> 02:20:36.840 align:start position:0%
average cost to educate one student in
 
02:20:38.630 --> 02:20:38.640 align:start position:0%
um I almost said in do I'm so used to
 
02:20:41.030 --> 02:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
saying in do if we if we look at the
 
02:20:43.190 --> 02:20:43.200 align:start position:0%
average cost Statewide to educate one
 
02:20:46.710 --> 02:20:46.720 align:start position:0%
student and we set that um around
 
02:20:50.270 --> 02:20:50.280 align:start position:0%
$20,000 that $30,000 Mark is one and a
 
02:20:52.990 --> 02:20:53.000 align:start position:0%
half times and so I would Advocate that
 
02:20:54.750 --> 02:20:54.760 align:start position:0%
as you are thinking about how to
 
02:20:57.389 --> 02:20:57.399 align:start position:0%
potentially shift this three and a half
 
02:21:01.990 --> 02:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
um 3.5% or 3.5 times number down uh
 
02:21:04.790 --> 02:21:04.800 align:start position:0%
perhaps even further down than three uh
 
02:21:07.190 --> 02:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
I would advocate for going as low as one
 
02:21:10.590 --> 02:21:10.600 align:start position:0%
and a half times because that just about
 
02:21:13.190 --> 02:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
directly lines up with the true cost of
 
02:21:15.230 --> 02:21:15.240 align:start position:0%
the additional cost of special education
 
02:21:17.230 --> 02:21:17.240 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and that is all I have
 
02:21:19.349 --> 02:21:19.359 align:start position:0%
to say um thank you for addressing this
 
02:21:21.309 --> 02:21:21.319 align:start position:0%
I know there are many bills
 
02:21:24.429 --> 02:21:24.439 align:start position:0%
uh covering all of these things and I do
 
02:21:25.950 --> 02:21:25.960 align:start position:0%
value the work and the effort you are
 
02:21:27.790 --> 02:21:27.800 align:start position:0%
putting to really listen to the people
 
02:21:29.750 --> 02:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
in school districts who are telling you
 
02:21:31.389 --> 02:21:31.399 align:start position:0%
the real life stories of how this is
 
02:21:33.110 --> 02:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
affecting um their communities and their
 
02:21:35.150 --> 02:21:35.160 align:start position:0%
taxpayers so thank you and I'm happy to
 
02:21:36.309 --> 02:21:36.319 align:start position:0%
take any
 
02:21:39.309 --> 02:21:39.319 align:start position:0%
questions questions from the committee
 
02:21:42.830 --> 02:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
very good thank you thank you and uh
 
02:21:57.469 --> 02:21:57.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:59.150 --> 02:21:59.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman my name is Jerry
 
02:22:00.950 --> 02:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
FW the associate executive director of
 
02:22:02.590 --> 02:22:02.600 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire school administrators
 
02:22:04.150 --> 02:22:04.160 align:start position:0%
Association I know that we're
 
02:22:06.349 --> 02:22:06.359 align:start position:0%
approaching lunch very quickly so uh and
 
02:22:08.150 --> 02:22:08.160 align:start position:0%
I know how chairman lad gets about
 
02:22:10.830 --> 02:22:10.840 align:start position:0%
lunchtime so uh I will make this very
 
02:22:13.389 --> 02:22:13.399 align:start position:0%
brief I would just like to commend to
 
02:22:16.590 --> 02:22:16.600 align:start position:0%
this committee uh to read the testimony
 
02:22:18.349 --> 02:22:18.359 align:start position:0%
uh regarding
 
02:22:20.590 --> 02:22:20.600 align:start position:0%
hb77 that was submitted by super
 
02:22:22.550 --> 02:22:22.560 align:start position:0%
intendent of schools chip McGee from
 
02:22:26.429 --> 02:22:26.439 align:start position:0%
pelum which talks about the impact of uh
 
02:22:28.790 --> 02:22:28.800 align:start position:0%
the underfunding of the current year
 
02:22:31.990 --> 02:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
special education
 
02:22:34.950 --> 02:22:34.960 align:start position:0%
um funds that were provided to school
 
02:22:37.190 --> 02:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
districts it talks about pel's challenge
 
02:22:39.550 --> 02:22:39.560 align:start position:0%
of about
 
02:22:42.910 --> 02:22:42.920 align:start position:0%
$266,000 of of special ed Aid that they
 
02:22:45.230 --> 02:22:45.240 align:start position:0%
anticipated that they did not get uh
 
02:22:46.830 --> 02:22:46.840 align:start position:0%
because typically the reimbursement
 
02:22:50.190 --> 02:22:50.200 align:start position:0%
rates have been around 80% uh in recent
 
02:22:52.230 --> 02:22:52.240 align:start position:0%
years and this year the reimbursement
 
02:22:55.670 --> 02:22:55.680 align:start position:0%
rate was closer to 66 or
 
02:23:00.790 --> 02:23:00.800 align:start position:0%
67% and uh superintendent McGee offers
 
02:23:03.710 --> 02:23:03.720 align:start position:0%
an amendment perhaps for chairman lad's
 
02:23:05.950 --> 02:23:05.960 align:start position:0%
bill which would uh help school
 
02:23:09.830 --> 02:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
districts recover some of the Lost um
 
02:23:12.389 --> 02:23:12.399 align:start position:0%
opportunity to recover costs in the
 
02:23:15.150 --> 02:23:15.160 align:start position:0%
current year um and so I would just
 
02:23:17.110 --> 02:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
encourage you to look at that he also
 
02:23:20.070 --> 02:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
illustrates the last seven years the New
 
02:23:22.469 --> 02:23:22.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire education Department's um
 
02:23:25.990 --> 02:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
budget uh in this area and um gives you
 
02:23:27.950 --> 02:23:27.960 align:start position:0%
some good information for discussion
 
02:23:28.990 --> 02:23:29.000 align:start position:0%
that's all I'll
 
02:23:32.190 --> 02:23:32.200 align:start position:0%
say good thank you very much thank you
 
02:23:36.429 --> 02:23:36.439 align:start position:0%
okay no questions all set then I believe
 
02:23:37.950 --> 02:23:37.960 align:start position:0%
uh is there anybody else who'd like to
 
02:23:40.150 --> 02:23:40.160 align:start position:0%
speak on
 
02:23:42.950 --> 02:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
hb77 Al with that I'll close the
 
02:23:46.790 --> 02:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
hearing and return the gab okay um and
 
02:23:48.990 --> 02:23:49.000 align:start position:0%
we're going to try to get through this
 
02:23:51.670 --> 02:23:51.680 align:start position:0%
next bill prior to Launch
 
02:23:57.070 --> 02:23:57.080 align:start position:0%
um uh it's HP 742 and just word to Jerry
 
02:23:59.630 --> 02:23:59.640 align:start position:0%
F was just up here yeah I did see chip
 
02:24:01.510 --> 02:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
McGee had was one of those districts
 
02:24:04.670 --> 02:24:04.680 align:start position:0%
pelum is in tough Straits I saw that
 
02:24:06.950 --> 02:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
last night on the on the data that came
 
02:24:11.550 --> 02:24:11.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:29.510 --> 02:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:32.429 --> 02:24:32.439 align:start position:0%
welcome you want me to go luno go for it
 
02:24:34.469 --> 02:24:34.479 align:start position:0%
thank you very much 742 requiring
 
02:24:36.389 --> 02:24:36.399 align:start position:0%
catastrophic special education state aid
 
02:24:38.349 --> 02:24:38.359 align:start position:0%
funding to be drawn from the education
 
02:24:40.990 --> 02:24:41.000 align:start position:0%
trust fund terrific thank you very much
 
02:24:42.950 --> 02:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
for the introduction Mr chair members of
 
02:24:44.750 --> 02:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
the committee uh for the record my name
 
02:24:46.710 --> 02:24:46.720 align:start position:0%
is Dave luno uh representing the people
 
02:24:50.030 --> 02:24:50.040 align:start position:0%
of Mari County District 9 um who are the
 
02:24:52.910 --> 02:24:52.920 align:start position:0%
fol of Hopkin and B but I don't give up
 
02:24:54.670 --> 02:24:54.680 align:start position:0%
conquered very easily or any other parts
 
02:24:57.389 --> 02:24:57.399 align:start position:0%
of the great state of New Hampshire so
 
02:24:59.710 --> 02:24:59.720 align:start position:0%
um so as all of the bills that we're
 
02:25:01.910 --> 02:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
talking about in this committee seem to
 
02:25:04.190 --> 02:25:04.200 align:start position:0%
affect everybody across um across the
 
02:25:06.870 --> 02:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
state and um and certainly affect all of
 
02:25:09.750 --> 02:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
our constituents our neighbors and our
 
02:25:14.190 --> 02:25:14.200 align:start position:0%
friends so so U HB 742 as the chair said
 
02:25:16.950 --> 02:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
is directed to how school districts uh
 
02:25:19.429 --> 02:25:19.439 align:start position:0%
receive the state's categorical grant
 
02:25:22.550 --> 02:25:22.560 align:start position:0%
for special educ ation it's the exact
 
02:25:25.510 --> 02:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
same grant that uh that representative
 
02:25:27.910 --> 02:25:27.920 align:start position:0%
llad was talking about in the preceding
 
02:25:32.790 --> 02:25:32.800 align:start position:0%
Bill house bill um 717 and so this is a
 
02:25:35.309 --> 02:25:35.319 align:start position:0%
uh this is a little bit different than
 
02:25:38.150 --> 02:25:38.160 align:start position:0%
um than the uh adequacy grant that
 
02:25:40.190 --> 02:25:40.200 align:start position:0%
school districts receive in fact it's
 
02:25:43.230 --> 02:25:43.240 align:start position:0%
not an Ade adequacy Grant it's called a
 
02:25:47.070 --> 02:25:47.080 align:start position:0%
categorical Grant and um and it um it's
 
02:25:50.469 --> 02:25:50.479 align:start position:0%
very specific to um to a set of
 
02:25:53.790 --> 02:25:53.800 align:start position:0%
conditions with respect to um expenses
 
02:25:56.190 --> 02:25:56.200 align:start position:0%
for special education students that
 
02:25:58.070 --> 02:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
qualify and as as representative Vlad
 
02:26:00.790 --> 02:26:00.800 align:start position:0%
was talking about in the last bill uh it
 
02:26:03.150 --> 02:26:03.160 align:start position:0%
would reduce that threshold from uh from
 
02:26:05.230 --> 02:26:05.240 align:start position:0%
three and a half to three potentially as
 
02:26:06.710 --> 02:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
representative spilburg was talk about
 
02:26:08.590 --> 02:26:08.600 align:start position:0%
to two and a half but that's not what
 
02:26:11.630 --> 02:26:11.640 align:start position:0%
this bill does um this bill is about how
 
02:26:13.550 --> 02:26:13.560 align:start position:0%
the school districts receive the state's
 
02:26:16.469 --> 02:26:16.479 align:start position:0%
categorical grant for special education
 
02:26:18.870 --> 02:26:18.880 align:start position:0%
so I want to start off talking about how
 
02:26:20.670 --> 02:26:20.680 align:start position:0%
students in New Hampshire schools
 
02:26:22.910 --> 02:26:22.920 align:start position:0%
perform among the best in the country
 
02:26:24.309 --> 02:26:24.319 align:start position:0%
and uh and you don't have to just
 
02:26:26.110 --> 02:26:26.120 align:start position:0%
believe me when I say it and I do say it
 
02:26:29.550 --> 02:26:29.560 align:start position:0%
a lot but uh Governor Chris sonunu uh
 
02:26:32.349 --> 02:26:32.359 align:start position:0%
said it in um in this in his last um
 
02:26:34.630 --> 02:26:34.640 align:start position:0%
State of the State address in fact uh I
 
02:26:36.269 --> 02:26:36.279 align:start position:0%
think he said we're we're top five in
 
02:26:38.070 --> 02:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
the country and that's a lot to be uh
 
02:26:40.429 --> 02:26:40.439 align:start position:0%
proud about uh particularly when we're
 
02:26:42.230 --> 02:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
last in the country when it comes to the
 
02:26:46.790 --> 02:26:46.800 align:start position:0%
state share of um of public schools uh
 
02:26:49.870 --> 02:26:49.880 align:start position:0%
but um but you know it's it's really
 
02:26:53.590 --> 02:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
also amazing to think about that that uh
 
02:26:57.070 --> 02:26:57.080 align:start position:0%
that our students uh do do so well our
 
02:26:59.070 --> 02:26:59.080 align:start position:0%
public school students do so well
 
02:27:00.750 --> 02:27:00.760 align:start position:0%
because public schools have to be
 
02:27:02.950 --> 02:27:02.960 align:start position:0%
everything to everybody and that's
 
02:27:05.230 --> 02:27:05.240 align:start position:0%
something we don't talk a lot um talk a
 
02:27:07.950 --> 02:27:07.960 align:start position:0%
lot about um public schools are not one
 
02:27:12.150 --> 02:27:12.160 align:start position:0%
siiz fits all um uh and here's another
 
02:27:14.030 --> 02:27:14.040 align:start position:0%
fact to sort of throw out actually I
 
02:27:15.710 --> 02:27:15.720 align:start position:0%
think it's close to effect maybe a
 
02:27:17.630 --> 02:27:17.640 align:start position:0%
little off but I think I I hear it quite
 
02:27:19.150 --> 02:27:19.160 align:start position:0%
a bit New Hampshire is among the
 
02:27:20.710 --> 02:27:20.720 align:start position:0%
wealthiest states in the
 
02:27:23.830 --> 02:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
ation we might even be number one we can
 
02:27:25.469 --> 02:27:25.479 align:start position:0%
probably fact check that but I think
 
02:27:29.190 --> 02:27:29.200 align:start position:0%
we're I think we're close and and a lot
 
02:27:32.269 --> 02:27:32.279 align:start position:0%
of the kids that that attend our Public
 
02:27:35.630 --> 02:27:35.640 align:start position:0%
Schools do come from affluent
 
02:27:37.710 --> 02:27:37.720 align:start position:0%
backgrounds but also a lot of the kids
 
02:27:39.750 --> 02:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
come from lowincome families too you
 
02:27:42.830 --> 02:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
don't have to get go very far to um to
 
02:27:46.110 --> 02:27:46.120 align:start position:0%
to see that happening all across the
 
02:27:48.590 --> 02:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
State teachers in all of our public
 
02:27:51.550 --> 02:27:51.560 align:start position:0%
schools have classrooms filled with all
 
02:27:53.230 --> 02:27:53.240 align:start position:0%
kinds of different
 
02:27:55.750 --> 02:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
students I know we do in Hopkinson
 
02:27:57.870 --> 02:27:57.880 align:start position:0%
Hopkin's a very soci economically
 
02:28:02.150 --> 02:28:02.160 align:start position:0%
diverse Community uh despite its um its
 
02:28:02.160 --> 02:28:05.150 align:start position:0%
diverse Community uh despite its um its
its

02:28:05.150 --> 02:28:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:08.670 --> 02:28:08.680 align:start position:0%
reputation and School classrooms do look
 
02:28:11.269 --> 02:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
a lot like the general population people
 
02:28:13.910 --> 02:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
that we all interact with every day as
 
02:28:17.950 --> 02:28:17.960 align:start position:0%
um as grown-ups and
 
02:28:21.230 --> 02:28:21.240 align:start position:0%
um important to know that public schools
 
02:28:23.429 --> 02:28:23.439 align:start position:0%
don't discriminate whether you're rich
 
02:28:26.070 --> 02:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
or poor what type of background you came
 
02:28:28.230 --> 02:28:28.240 align:start position:0%
from what type of country you might have
 
02:28:29.710 --> 02:28:29.720 align:start position:0%
came from what languages you speak
 
02:28:31.830 --> 02:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
Public Schools don't discriminate
 
02:28:33.030 --> 02:28:33.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter what the student
 
02:28:36.309 --> 02:28:36.319 align:start position:0%
background is public schools don't
 
02:28:38.910 --> 02:28:38.920 align:start position:0%
discriminate Public Schools work with
 
02:28:43.750 --> 02:28:43.760 align:start position:0%
every student even students with complex
 
02:28:46.389 --> 02:28:46.399 align:start position:0%
needs for example physical
 
02:28:49.389 --> 02:28:49.399 align:start position:0%
disabilities developmental disabilities
 
02:28:51.510 --> 02:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
and we've heard a lot about the range of
 
02:28:53.990 --> 02:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
services these students
 
02:28:57.230 --> 02:28:57.240 align:start position:0%
receive not really going to get into to
 
02:29:01.550 --> 02:29:01.560 align:start position:0%
that um some of these um some of these
 
02:29:05.670 --> 02:29:05.680 align:start position:0%
disabilities and and student um
 
02:29:09.030 --> 02:29:09.040 align:start position:0%
characteristics might last a short time
 
02:29:11.469 --> 02:29:11.479 align:start position:0%
I think we heard earlier about a student
 
02:29:15.030 --> 02:29:15.040 align:start position:0%
who's um who who um graduated out of
 
02:29:15.040 --> 02:29:16.510 align:start position:0%
who's um who who um graduated out of
their

02:29:16.510 --> 02:29:16.520 align:start position:0%
their
 
02:29:21.070 --> 02:29:21.080 align:start position:0%
IEP but others might last a lifetime
 
02:29:23.150 --> 02:29:23.160 align:start position:0%
but most importantly Public Schools
 
02:29:25.150 --> 02:29:25.160 align:start position:0%
don't discriminate doesn't really matter
 
02:29:27.110 --> 02:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
whether it's a shorttime thing or a
 
02:29:29.070 --> 02:29:29.080 align:start position:0%
lifetime type condition Public Schools
 
02:29:29.080 --> 02:29:30.309 align:start position:0%
lifetime type condition Public Schools
don't

02:29:30.309 --> 02:29:30.319 align:start position:0%
don't
 
02:29:32.349 --> 02:29:32.359 align:start position:0%
discriminate and our Public School
 
02:29:35.510 --> 02:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
teachers work with all of these kids um
 
02:29:37.389 --> 02:29:37.399 align:start position:0%
in different ways to meet them where
 
02:29:41.030 --> 02:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
they're at and to meet their needs so
 
02:29:45.389 --> 02:29:45.399 align:start position:0%
public schools are not one siiz fits
 
02:29:48.870 --> 02:29:48.880 align:start position:0%
all and people all over the granite
 
02:29:51.630 --> 02:29:51.640 align:start position:0%
state have high expectations for our
 
02:29:54.110 --> 02:29:54.120 align:start position:0%
public schools that they serve all of
 
02:29:54.120 --> 02:29:55.590 align:start position:0%
public schools that they serve all of
our

02:29:55.590 --> 02:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
our
 
02:29:58.790 --> 02:29:58.800 align:start position:0%
kids without discrimination and with
 
02:30:00.790 --> 02:30:00.800 align:start position:0%
strong student outcomes just like the
 
02:30:03.590 --> 02:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
governor said in his State of the State
 
02:30:06.190 --> 02:30:06.200 align:start position:0%
address and granite Staters and this is
 
02:30:08.190 --> 02:30:08.200 align:start position:0%
where it really becomes cool Granite
 
02:30:11.070 --> 02:30:11.080 align:start position:0%
Staters vote on school budgets that are
 
02:30:12.870 --> 02:30:12.880 align:start position:0%
also among the strongest in the country
 
02:30:14.590 --> 02:30:14.600 align:start position:0%
I know a lot of people don't don't don't
 
02:30:17.750 --> 02:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
like to hear that but but these budgets
 
02:30:20.469 --> 02:30:20.479 align:start position:0%
are are voted on by
 
02:30:22.030 --> 02:30:22.040 align:start position:0%
our friends our
 
02:30:25.590 --> 02:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
neighbors the people who who who live um
 
02:30:28.469 --> 02:30:28.479 align:start position:0%
in our um in our in our cities and
 
02:30:32.750 --> 02:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
towns and and they don't just say okay
 
02:30:35.309 --> 02:30:35.319 align:start position:0%
let's vote on a SC strong school budget
 
02:30:37.630 --> 02:30:37.640 align:start position:0%
they open their wallets to fund them
 
02:30:39.750 --> 02:30:39.760 align:start position:0%
with the highest property taxes in the
 
02:30:42.790 --> 02:30:42.800 align:start position:0%
country and the lowest State share to
 
02:30:44.710 --> 02:30:44.720 align:start position:0%
help them with these
 
02:30:47.550 --> 02:30:47.560 align:start position:0%
costs other states have significantly
 
02:30:50.510 --> 02:30:50.520 align:start position:0%
lower property taxes and a much higher
 
02:30:52.990 --> 02:30:53.000 align:start position:0%
share of financial report support for
 
02:30:55.150 --> 02:30:55.160 align:start position:0%
public schools there's a correlation
 
02:30:57.990 --> 02:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
here so don't let anybody tell you that
 
02:30:59.469 --> 02:30:59.479 align:start position:0%
when the state sends more money to
 
02:31:01.349 --> 02:31:01.359 align:start position:0%
Public Schools it doesn't do anything
 
02:31:03.389 --> 02:31:03.399 align:start position:0%
for property taxes because every other
 
02:31:06.349 --> 02:31:06.359 align:start position:0%
freaking state in this country uh proves
 
02:31:08.950 --> 02:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
that proves that assertion
 
02:31:13.349 --> 02:31:13.359 align:start position:0%
wrong high expectations serving all kids
 
02:31:15.150 --> 02:31:15.160 align:start position:0%
and granite Staters put their money
 
02:31:18.510 --> 02:31:18.520 align:start position:0%
where their mouth is and the results are
 
02:31:18.520 --> 02:31:20.670 align:start position:0%
where their mouth is and the results are
there

02:31:20.670 --> 02:31:20.680 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:31:23.750 --> 02:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
even the recent npe tests show how New
 
02:31:26.710 --> 02:31:26.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is Bucking the national Trend
 
02:31:28.269 --> 02:31:28.279 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the state doesn't seem to
 
02:31:29.429 --> 02:31:29.439 align:start position:0%
share these
 
02:31:32.349 --> 02:31:32.359 align:start position:0%
values over the last eight years the
 
02:31:33.950 --> 02:31:33.960 align:start position:0%
state has lowered standards for
 
02:31:36.630 --> 02:31:36.640 align:start position:0%
curriculum instruction and assessment
 
02:31:38.269 --> 02:31:38.279 align:start position:0%
they've eliminated standards for
 
02:31:40.389 --> 02:31:40.399 align:start position:0%
superintendents who lead our schools and
 
02:31:44.110 --> 02:31:44.120 align:start position:0%
educate 160,000 kids every year they've
 
02:31:46.190 --> 02:31:46.200 align:start position:0%
eliminated standards for school business
 
02:31:48.190 --> 02:31:48.200 align:start position:0%
officers who are responsible for more
 
02:31:50.389 --> 02:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
than 3 and a half billion public tax
 
02:31:52.710 --> 02:31:52.720 align:start position:0%
dollars every year and the commissioner
 
02:31:54.830 --> 02:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
has even proposed slashing the
 
02:31:57.150 --> 02:31:57.160 align:start position:0%
substantive content that defines an
 
02:31:59.590 --> 02:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity for an adequate education
 
02:32:01.710 --> 02:32:01.720 align:start position:0%
the very subjects that schools must
 
02:32:04.750 --> 02:32:04.760 align:start position:0%
offer giving students voice and choice
 
02:32:06.510 --> 02:32:06.520 align:start position:0%
and I'm getting right a little bit more
 
02:32:08.349 --> 02:32:08.359 align:start position:0%
at the cat side yeah y getting right to
 
02:32:11.349 --> 02:32:11.359 align:start position:0%
it Mr chair thank you um and doing this
 
02:32:13.469 --> 02:32:13.479 align:start position:0%
while raising an arbitrary cut line for
 
02:32:16.870 --> 02:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
per for proficiency it's good to have
 
02:32:20.630 --> 02:32:20.640 align:start position:0%
high expectations right we share that
 
02:32:21.990 --> 02:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
public schools are not one-sized
 
02:32:23.389 --> 02:32:23.399 align:start position:0%
fits-all Public Schools don't
 
02:32:26.349 --> 02:32:26.359 align:start position:0%
discriminate so back to the bill so Mr
 
02:32:28.309 --> 02:32:28.319 align:start position:0%
chair you got me at the right time back
 
02:32:30.590 --> 02:32:30.600 align:start position:0%
to the bill Public Schools work with
 
02:32:33.110 --> 02:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
every student even students with complex
 
02:32:35.750 --> 02:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
needs that's what this bill's about and
 
02:32:37.510 --> 02:32:37.520 align:start position:0%
that's where this categorical grant for
 
02:32:39.910 --> 02:32:39.920 align:start position:0%
special education comes in the bill
 
02:32:42.030 --> 02:32:42.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't change the grant just how it
 
02:32:44.190 --> 02:32:44.200 align:start position:0%
works current law says that when the
 
02:32:45.790 --> 02:32:45.800 align:start position:0%
cost for a student exceeds three and a
 
02:32:48.070 --> 02:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
half times the average cost the state
 
02:32:50.150 --> 02:32:50.160 align:start position:0%
picks up half of it and for students
 
02:32:52.630 --> 02:32:52.640 align:start position:0%
more than 10 times the average cost it
 
02:32:55.630 --> 02:32:55.640 align:start position:0%
picks up all of it you know if we want
 
02:32:58.230 --> 02:32:58.240 align:start position:0%
to look at other policy changes rather
 
02:32:59.550 --> 02:32:59.560 align:start position:0%
than three and a half times make it
 
02:33:01.469 --> 02:33:01.479 align:start position:0%
three times make it two and a half times
 
02:33:04.349 --> 02:33:04.359 align:start position:0%
this bill is not weighing in um uh on
 
02:33:08.269 --> 02:33:08.279 align:start position:0%
that um but the payment that the state
 
02:33:10.630 --> 02:33:10.640 align:start position:0%
makes from that currently is subject to
 
02:33:13.110 --> 02:33:13.120 align:start position:0%
a two-year budget appropriation and if
 
02:33:15.389 --> 02:33:15.399 align:start position:0%
not enough money is appropriated the
 
02:33:18.030 --> 02:33:18.040 align:start position:0%
state share is pro-rated and districts
 
02:33:20.510 --> 02:33:20.520 align:start position:0%
don't get what they're expecting keep in
 
02:33:22.190 --> 02:33:22.200 align:start position:0%
mind these are costs incurred by the
 
02:33:23.870 --> 02:33:23.880 align:start position:0%
school district and when the state
 
02:33:25.990 --> 02:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't pick up its share it falls on
 
02:33:28.790 --> 02:33:28.800 align:start position:0%
the local property taxpayer and that's
 
02:33:31.550 --> 02:33:31.560 align:start position:0%
exactly what happened this school year
 
02:33:34.670 --> 02:33:34.680 align:start position:0%
this school year not talking about
 
02:33:36.950 --> 02:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
budgets that are now being approved for
 
02:33:40.630 --> 02:33:40.640 align:start position:0%
FY 26 I'm talking about this school year
 
02:33:42.670 --> 02:33:42.680 align:start position:0%
not enough money was appropriated by the
 
02:33:44.630 --> 02:33:44.640 align:start position:0%
state to cover the state share of
 
02:33:47.389 --> 02:33:47.399 align:start position:0%
necessary Services required under state
 
02:33:49.990 --> 02:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
and federal law and that means the state
 
02:33:52.150 --> 02:33:52.160 align:start position:0%
would Short change schools by more than
 
02:33:52.160 --> 02:33:54.590 align:start position:0%
would Short change schools by more than
$17

02:33:54.590 --> 02:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
$17
 
02:33:56.710 --> 02:33:56.720 align:start position:0%
million got to ask yourselves what's
 
02:33:58.349 --> 02:33:58.359 align:start position:0%
that mean for your districts what does
 
02:34:01.309 --> 02:34:01.319 align:start position:0%
that mean for taxpayers where you live
 
02:34:03.349 --> 02:34:03.359 align:start position:0%
so what this bill does is eliminates the
 
02:34:05.750 --> 02:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
budget appropriation and makes the
 
02:34:09.349 --> 02:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
special education Aid payment come from
 
02:34:12.590 --> 02:34:12.600 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund the same fund
 
02:34:14.790 --> 02:34:14.800 align:start position:0%
that guarantees and remember payments
 
02:34:16.510 --> 02:34:16.520 align:start position:0%
from the education trust fund are
 
02:34:20.030 --> 02:34:20.040 align:start position:0%
guaranteed it's a must pay type fund the
 
02:34:22.710 --> 02:34:22.720 align:start position:0%
same fund that guarantees adequate educ
 
02:34:25.309 --> 02:34:25.319 align:start position:0%
education payments to our public schools
 
02:34:27.269 --> 02:34:27.279 align:start position:0%
and payments for charter schools and
 
02:34:30.510 --> 02:34:30.520 align:start position:0%
payments for vouchers it's must pay and
 
02:34:32.309 --> 02:34:32.319 align:start position:0%
I'm not here to weigh in on the policy
 
02:34:33.950 --> 02:34:33.960 align:start position:0%
but only that the state puts its money
 
02:34:36.469 --> 02:34:36.479 align:start position:0%
where its mouth is obviously this part
 
02:34:38.830 --> 02:34:38.840 align:start position:0%
bill is part of a group of bills just as
 
02:34:41.349 --> 02:34:41.359 align:start position:0%
the proceeding bill is and and others
 
02:34:43.670 --> 02:34:43.680 align:start position:0%
from earlier today relating to special
 
02:34:46.349 --> 02:34:46.359 align:start position:0%
education and we'll be working on all of
 
02:34:50.110 --> 02:34:50.120 align:start position:0%
them uh Mr chair I believe tomorrow
 
02:34:52.150 --> 02:34:52.160 align:start position:0%
correct are you done right now yeah yeah
 
02:34:54.670 --> 02:34:54.680 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah yeah yeah that that's my wrap
 
02:34:57.150 --> 02:34:57.160 align:start position:0%
up that we'll be working on these yeah
 
02:34:59.830 --> 02:34:59.840 align:start position:0%
tomorrow so I I have a question for you
 
02:35:01.830 --> 02:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
the last sentence the last sentence in
 
02:35:06.750 --> 02:35:06.760 align:start position:0%
your bill uh this reporting shall not in
 
02:35:09.349 --> 02:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
any way prohibit or delay the
 
02:35:10.910 --> 02:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
distribution of
 
02:35:10.920 --> 02:35:12.750 align:start position:0%
distribution of
payments

02:35:12.750 --> 02:35:12.760 align:start position:0%
payments
 
02:35:15.230 --> 02:35:15.240 align:start position:0%
now right now we know that our payments
 
02:35:18.110 --> 02:35:18.120 align:start position:0%
for catastrophic Aid are based upon uh
 
02:35:22.150 --> 02:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
what we had in the from the previous
 
02:35:22.160 --> 02:35:25.070 align:start position:0%
what we had in the from the previous
year

02:35:25.070 --> 02:35:25.080 align:start position:0%
year
 
02:35:29.190 --> 02:35:29.200 align:start position:0%
um kids move in to your District this
 
02:35:31.950 --> 02:35:31.960 align:start position:0%
year does this give free
 
02:35:31.960 --> 02:35:34.309 align:start position:0%
year does this give free
range

02:35:34.309 --> 02:35:34.319 align:start position:0%
range
 
02:35:36.910 --> 02:35:36.920 align:start position:0%
free ability for the commissioner of the
 
02:35:39.190 --> 02:35:39.200 align:start position:0%
Department of administrative services or
 
02:35:41.710 --> 02:35:41.720 align:start position:0%
whomever to reach into this education
 
02:35:44.030 --> 02:35:44.040 align:start position:0%
trust fund and subtract money at any
 
02:35:46.469 --> 02:35:46.479 align:start position:0%
time without having this approved by
 
02:35:49.389 --> 02:35:49.399 align:start position:0%
some agency of the legislature um it
 
02:35:51.910 --> 02:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
well it it would be having been approved
 
02:35:54.790 --> 02:35:54.800 align:start position:0%
as a law it's it's approved by by the
 
02:35:57.269 --> 02:35:57.279 align:start position:0%
legislature the same way as guaranteed
 
02:36:00.389 --> 02:36:00.399 align:start position:0%
payments for for public school adequacy
 
02:36:02.830 --> 02:36:02.840 align:start position:0%
for charter schools and for vouchers are
 
02:36:06.269 --> 02:36:06.279 align:start position:0%
all guaranteed and in fact this language
 
02:36:08.190 --> 02:36:08.200 align:start position:0%
here and the the and the report we're
 
02:36:10.590 --> 02:36:10.600 align:start position:0%
talk talking about is an education trust
 
02:36:12.870 --> 02:36:12.880 align:start position:0%
fund deficiency report so it's where
 
02:36:15.070 --> 02:36:15.080 align:start position:0%
that it's where the trust fund has gone
 
02:36:17.230 --> 02:36:17.240 align:start position:0%
negative whether that's because of
 
02:36:20.110 --> 02:36:20.120 align:start position:0%
paying you know um you know uh providing
 
02:36:23.710 --> 02:36:23.720 align:start position:0%
money into into efas or whether it's
 
02:36:27.950 --> 02:36:27.960 align:start position:0%
paying U paying money to uh with with
 
02:36:29.790 --> 02:36:29.800 align:start position:0%
one year in a because this is all based
 
02:36:32.110 --> 02:36:32.120 align:start position:0%
on onee look back to uh to public
 
02:36:34.790 --> 02:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
schools for special education aid but
 
02:36:36.710 --> 02:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
but it's very clear and this this
 
02:36:39.670 --> 02:36:39.680 align:start position:0%
language here was
 
02:36:41.830 --> 02:36:41.840 align:start position:0%
taken and obviously you can quote me
 
02:36:43.190 --> 02:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
because I'm here being you know being
 
02:36:46.030 --> 02:36:46.040 align:start position:0%
quoted but it's taken from existing law
 
02:36:47.710 --> 02:36:47.720 align:start position:0%
whether it was from whether it was from
 
02:36:50.070 --> 02:36:50.080 align:start position:0%
the charter school section the
 
02:36:52.710 --> 02:36:52.720 align:start position:0%
section or the voucher Section I don't
 
02:36:55.349 --> 02:36:55.359 align:start position:0%
remember but but it says that that
 
02:36:57.550 --> 02:36:57.560 align:start position:0%
should the education trust fund fall
 
02:37:02.309 --> 02:37:02.319 align:start position:0%
into negative the governor shall um um
 
02:37:03.990 --> 02:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
the governor is authorized to draw a
 
02:37:05.710 --> 02:37:05.720 align:start position:0%
warrant from the education trust fund to
 
02:37:07.349 --> 02:37:07.359 align:start position:0%
satisfy the state's obligation under the
 
02:37:09.269 --> 02:37:09.279 align:start position:0%
section such warrant for payment shall
 
02:37:11.469 --> 02:37:11.479 align:start position:0%
be issued regardless of the balance of
 
02:37:13.110 --> 02:37:13.120 align:start position:0%
funds available in the education trust
 
02:37:14.750 --> 02:37:14.760 align:start position:0%
line if the balance in the education
 
02:37:17.110 --> 02:37:17.120 align:start position:0%
trust fund after issuance of such
 
02:37:19.550 --> 02:37:19.560 align:start position:0%
payment is less than zero the state com
 
02:37:22.030 --> 02:37:22.040 align:start position:0%
trer shall transfer sufficient funds
 
02:37:24.349 --> 02:37:24.359 align:start position:0%
from the general fund to eliminate such
 
02:37:26.830 --> 02:37:26.840 align:start position:0%
deficit and that deficit report does get
 
02:37:29.950 --> 02:37:29.960 align:start position:0%
reported to the um to the um the fiscal
 
02:37:32.269 --> 02:37:32.279 align:start position:0%
committee and uh so that's that's
 
02:37:35.070 --> 02:37:35.080 align:start position:0%
language from existing law that draws on
 
02:37:38.030 --> 02:37:38.040 align:start position:0%
the uh the the trust fund the the other
 
02:37:39.510 --> 02:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
um the other
 
02:37:42.070 --> 02:37:42.080 align:start position:0%
operable um well actually the whole the
 
02:37:44.750 --> 02:37:44.760 align:start position:0%
whole operable part of this is the um
 
02:37:46.870 --> 02:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
the changes in bold beginning at the
 
02:37:49.830 --> 02:37:49.840 align:start position:0%
bottom of the first page and then then
 
02:37:52.070 --> 02:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
and then obviously elimination of the
 
02:37:54.469 --> 02:37:54.479 align:start position:0%
appropriation Clause the pration clause
 
02:37:57.469 --> 02:37:57.479 align:start position:0%
and this funny little thing you know
 
02:37:59.710 --> 02:37:59.720 align:start position:0%
gimmicky thing that we did I think
 
02:38:02.230 --> 02:38:02.240 align:start position:0%
several years ago Mr chair that said if
 
02:38:04.190 --> 02:38:04.200 align:start position:0%
there's additional money left over in
 
02:38:06.590 --> 02:38:06.600 align:start position:0%
this fund which they never appears to be
 
02:38:09.429 --> 02:38:09.439 align:start position:0%
that we would somehow give it to uh to
 
02:38:11.830 --> 02:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
very very small school districts so that
 
02:38:15.670 --> 02:38:15.680 align:start position:0%
was the Senate did that no I was I was
 
02:38:17.870 --> 02:38:17.880 align:start position:0%
the name of the person who did that but
 
02:38:19.910 --> 02:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
that is where I want the next question I
 
02:38:22.429 --> 02:38:22.439 align:start position:0%
have here so we have two pots of money
 
02:38:25.710 --> 02:38:25.720 align:start position:0%
possibly this may $250,000 for this and
 
02:38:27.750 --> 02:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
250,000 for the ones that have less than
 
02:38:30.349 --> 02:38:30.359 align:start position:0%
a thousand kids in the district for to
 
02:38:33.349 --> 02:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
mitigate these issues which may arise
 
02:38:35.550 --> 02:38:35.560 align:start position:0%
that where where there's not the the
 
02:38:37.429 --> 02:38:37.439 align:start position:0%
money to do that at the local level they
 
02:38:38.950 --> 02:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
may not have a reserve account or
 
02:38:40.950 --> 02:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
something with the money for these
 
02:38:43.830 --> 02:38:43.840 align:start position:0%
catastrophic and $250,000 doesn't go far
 
02:38:46.070 --> 02:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
I know it wouldn't be wiser rather than
 
02:38:49.110 --> 02:38:49.120 align:start position:0%
to eliminate the whole thing to up that
 
02:38:51.550 --> 02:38:51.560 align:start position:0%
and over there in that side so that we
 
02:38:54.070 --> 02:38:54.080 align:start position:0%
have a pot of money there that's already
 
02:38:58.150 --> 02:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
been approved by hb2 and one I I mean Mr
 
02:39:01.950 --> 02:39:01.960 align:start position:0%
sherff if if if the legislature wants to
 
02:39:05.750 --> 02:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
um create a special fund uh to do that I
 
02:39:08.110 --> 02:39:08.120 align:start position:0%
suppose it could do so um I don't
 
02:39:11.190 --> 02:39:11.200 align:start position:0%
believe this has ever been invoked
 
02:39:12.830 --> 02:39:12.840 align:start position:0%
before because I don't believe there's
 
02:39:17.469 --> 02:39:17.479 align:start position:0%
ever been you know material um um um uh
 
02:39:20.190 --> 02:39:20.200 align:start position:0%
excess in the uh the what was formerly
 
02:39:23.389 --> 02:39:23.399 align:start position:0%
called the catastrophic Aid fund um
 
02:39:25.990 --> 02:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
catastrophic Aid appropriation or the
 
02:39:28.990 --> 02:39:29.000 align:start position:0%
special education Aid appropriation
 
02:39:32.030 --> 02:39:32.040 align:start position:0%
obviously U this would be incompatible
 
02:39:34.429 --> 02:39:34.439 align:start position:0%
with language since it's since this
 
02:39:37.590 --> 02:39:37.600 align:start position:0%
proposal here is to draw it on off the
 
02:39:40.309 --> 02:39:40.319 align:start position:0%
education trust fund which should almost
 
02:39:43.150 --> 02:39:43.160 align:start position:0%
always have additional funds in it and
 
02:39:45.309 --> 02:39:45.319 align:start position:0%
if it doesn't the com trol you know the
 
02:39:46.710 --> 02:39:46.720 align:start position:0%
governor draws a warrant and the com
 
02:39:50.389 --> 02:39:50.399 align:start position:0%
troller ships more money into it so um
 
02:39:52.830 --> 02:39:52.840 align:start position:0%
so it it it only really works in an
 
02:39:54.950 --> 02:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
appropriation type language so I I think
 
02:39:58.070 --> 02:39:58.080 align:start position:0%
if you if you want to see that and and
 
02:40:00.910 --> 02:40:00.920 align:start position:0%
and as I recall some of these very small
 
02:40:03.469 --> 02:40:03.479 align:start position:0%
school districts may even be schools
 
02:40:05.469 --> 02:40:05.479 align:start position:0%
that may even be districts that don't
 
02:40:08.670 --> 02:40:08.680 align:start position:0%
operate their own schools so excuse me
 
02:40:10.790 --> 02:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
so places like heart's location for
 
02:40:14.469 --> 02:40:14.479 align:start position:0%
example um you know that that has a a
 
02:40:18.110 --> 02:40:18.120 align:start position:0%
you know a a huge property valuation per
 
02:40:21.790 --> 02:40:21.800 align:start position:0%
per pupil uh seems unfair uh uh
 
02:40:25.990 --> 02:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
inequitable to to be um providing excess
 
02:40:30.190 --> 02:40:30.200 align:start position:0%
funds if ever anywhere to exist to to
 
02:40:33.230 --> 02:40:33.240 align:start position:0%
these communities with few kids enormous
 
02:40:35.550 --> 02:40:35.560 align:start position:0%
property valuations when when we've
 
02:40:39.230 --> 02:40:39.240 align:start position:0%
already heard today uh how much um these
 
02:40:42.750 --> 02:40:42.760 align:start position:0%
PR rations uh affect places like um
 
02:40:44.870 --> 02:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
Manchester and Newport and Charlestown
 
02:40:46.030 --> 02:40:46.040 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions from
 
02:40:48.030 --> 02:40:48.040 align:start position:0%
the committee represent
 
02:40:50.510 --> 02:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
Maguire thank thank you Mr chairman does
 
02:40:53.070 --> 02:40:53.080 align:start position:0%
the bill have a typo on page one line
 
02:40:56.190 --> 02:40:56.200 align:start position:0%
six yeah I've noticed that thank you
 
02:40:57.870 --> 02:40:57.880 align:start position:0%
very much representative Maguire I've
 
02:40:59.750 --> 02:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
noticed that on in other bills too I
 
02:41:02.269 --> 02:41:02.279 align:start position:0%
think it's more of a PDF or a printing
 
02:41:05.469 --> 02:41:05.479 align:start position:0%
error um and I don't know if
 
02:41:05.479 --> 02:41:07.469 align:start position:0%
error um and I don't know if
representative

02:41:07.469 --> 02:41:07.479 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:41:09.830 --> 02:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
lad's well I had yeah because yours
 
02:41:11.469 --> 02:41:11.479 align:start position:0%
yours modifies that a little bit
 
02:41:13.590 --> 02:41:13.600 align:start position:0%
differently with with paren with
 
02:41:16.230 --> 02:41:16.240 align:start position:0%
brackets and and a hash through it but
 
02:41:20.670 --> 02:41:20.680 align:start position:0%
but um I I I I I suspect it's either a
 
02:41:24.110 --> 02:41:24.120 align:start position:0%
typo or or some sort of artifact in um
 
02:41:27.990 --> 02:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
PDF you didn't intend to change it no
 
02:41:30.349 --> 02:41:30.359 align:start position:0%
three and a half thanks represent
 
02:41:32.230 --> 02:41:32.240 align:start position:0%
spilsbury do you have a real
 
02:41:34.710 --> 02:41:34.720 align:start position:0%
question my question just got asked oh
 
02:41:36.110 --> 02:41:36.120 align:start position:0%
you asked the same one I was going to
 
02:41:37.110 --> 02:41:37.120 align:start position:0%
ask that
 
02:41:39.710 --> 02:41:39.720 align:start position:0%
too I think everybody's looking at that
 
02:41:43.269 --> 02:41:43.279 align:start position:0%
that's why they say three t hre e and
 
02:41:46.590 --> 02:41:46.600 align:start position:0%
one p and and yeah but that's not that
 
02:41:48.590 --> 02:41:48.600 align:start position:0%
wasn't the point of the bill yeah I
 
02:41:49.830 --> 02:41:49.840 align:start position:0%
think that's where all our questions
 
02:41:52.150 --> 02:41:52.160 align:start position:0%
were yeah all right any further
 
02:41:54.030 --> 02:41:54.040 align:start position:0%
questions not seeing thank you very much
 
02:41:57.030 --> 02:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
great everybody can enjoy lunch well why
 
02:41:59.590 --> 02:41:59.600 align:start position:0%
we may have some good cards here we do
 
02:42:01.990 --> 02:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
we have one
 
02:42:06.670 --> 02:42:06.680 align:start position:0%
Kristen special education Advocates
 
02:42:08.870 --> 02:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
office hello I will be very brief in
 
02:42:12.349 --> 02:42:12.359 align:start position:0%
making just two points one um in
 
02:42:13.710 --> 02:42:13.720 align:start position:0%
listening to all of this testimony on
 
02:42:16.309 --> 02:42:16.319 align:start position:0%
the last four bills I hope um this
 
02:42:18.030 --> 02:42:18.040 align:start position:0%
committee will really consider whether
 
02:42:21.269 --> 02:42:21.279 align:start position:0%
some of the concern s about creating
 
02:42:26.550 --> 02:42:26.560 align:start position:0%
categories um or putting a flat cap or
 
02:42:29.110 --> 02:42:29.120 align:start position:0%
having you know a flat dollar amount
 
02:42:30.190 --> 02:42:30.200 align:start position:0%
because those are the three different
 
02:42:32.190 --> 02:42:32.200 align:start position:0%
things that were talked about could be
 
02:42:36.070 --> 02:42:36.080 align:start position:0%
alleviated by um further reductions as
 
02:42:37.950 --> 02:42:37.960 align:start position:0%
one person just suggested not going from
 
02:42:39.550 --> 02:42:39.560 align:start position:0%
three and a half to three but coming
 
02:42:42.870 --> 02:42:42.880 align:start position:0%
from three and a half further down 1 and
 
02:42:45.550 --> 02:42:45.560 align:start position:0%
a half two in the catastrophic Aid piece
 
02:42:46.910 --> 02:42:46.920 align:start position:0%
because then you're really dealing with
 
02:42:50.070 --> 02:42:50.080 align:start position:0%
actual costs um and then if those funds
 
02:42:52.710 --> 02:42:52.720 align:start position:0%
were guaranteed to districts you might
 
02:42:55.550 --> 02:42:55.560 align:start position:0%
avoid some of the agonizing over where
 
02:42:58.870 --> 02:42:58.880 align:start position:0%
um Caps or flat dollar amounts should be
 
02:43:02.110 --> 02:43:02.120 align:start position:0%
set and the difficulties with categories
 
02:43:04.469 --> 02:43:04.479 align:start position:0%
categories in terms of some federal
 
02:43:07.670 --> 02:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
prohibitions against having Aid depend
 
02:43:11.190 --> 02:43:11.200 align:start position:0%
on where a student's placed um so so
 
02:43:13.349 --> 02:43:13.359 align:start position:0%
really looking at the catastrophic Aid
 
02:43:15.070 --> 02:43:15.080 align:start position:0%
three and a half is it three is it maybe
 
02:43:17.870 --> 02:43:17.880 align:start position:0%
one and a half or two um could offset
 
02:43:19.790 --> 02:43:19.800 align:start position:0%
some of those challenges on the other
 
02:43:22.030 --> 02:43:22.040 align:start position:0%
side initially thank you very much any
 
02:43:24.590 --> 02:43:24.600 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee not seeing
 
02:43:26.630 --> 02:43:26.640 align:start position:0%
any thank you very much I do not have
 
02:43:28.710 --> 02:43:28.720 align:start position:0%
any other pink cards on us are there any
 
02:43:31.510 --> 02:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
pink cards forthcoming not seeing I will
 
02:43:34.070 --> 02:43:34.080 align:start position:0%
close the hearing on
 
02:43:37.590 --> 02:43:37.600 align:start position:0%
7:42 and we are taking a break until 1
 
02:43:40.830 --> 02:43:40.840 align:start position:0%
hour from now and coming back to look at

New Hampshire has wrestled with the
 
03:49:37.750 --> 03:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
challenge of ensuring that every student

has access to a quality education while
 
03:49:42.149 --> 03:49:42.159 align:start position:0%
also maintaining fairness in how we fund
 
03:49:44.790 --> 03:49:44.800 align:start position:0%
our schools today I present house bill
 
03:49:47.349 --> 03:49:47.359 align:start position:0%
675 legislation designed to provide a
 
03:49:49.349 --> 03:49:49.359 align:start position:0%
more sustainable transparent and
 
03:49:51.510 --> 03:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
Equitable approach to funding education
 
03:49:54.269 --> 03:49:54.279 align:start position:0%
across our state while also providing
 
03:49:57.070 --> 03:49:57.080 align:start position:0%
our legislative a a while providing a
 
03:49:59.830 --> 03:49:59.840 align:start position:0%
legislative vehicle to comply with any
 
03:50:01.510 --> 03:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
pending Court decisions if the
 
03:50:04.189 --> 03:50:04.199 align:start position:0%
legislature chooses to do so I'm going
 
03:50:06.790 --> 03:50:06.800 align:start position:0%
to just go over what this bill does this
 
03:50:09.429 --> 03:50:09.439 align:start position:0%
increases base adequacy Aid per pupil
 
03:50:12.590 --> 03:50:12.600 align:start position:0%

Grant will increase from 4,000 $100 to $
 
03:50:20.830 --> 03:50:20.840 align:start position:0%
7,356 And1 ensuring that every child
 
03:50:22.870 --> 03:50:22.880 align:start position:0%
regardless of their zip code receives
 
03:50:24.870 --> 03:50:24.880 align:start position:0%
the resources necessary for a quality
 
03:50:27.070 --> 03:50:27.080 align:start position:0%
education provides a sustainable
 
03:50:28.950 --> 03:50:28.960 align:start position:0%
predictable funding model for too long
 
03:50:31.070 --> 03:50:31.080 align:start position:0%
our education funding system has been
 
03:50:32.950 --> 03:50:32.960 align:start position:0%
unpredictable creating challenges for
 
03:50:35.469 --> 03:50:35.479 align:start position:0%
both school districts and taxpayers this
 
03:50:37.830 --> 03:50:37.840 align:start position:0%
bill ties education funding increases to
 
03:50:40.110 --> 03:50:40.120 align:start position:0%
the Consumer Price Index ensuring
 
03:50:42.070 --> 03:50:42.080 align:start position:0%
predictable and gradual adjustments that
 
03:50:44.269 --> 03:50:44.279 align:start position:0%
account for real economic conditions
 
03:50:45.830 --> 03:50:45.840 align:start position:0%
rather than than arbitrary political
 
03:50:48.710 --> 03:50:48.720 align:start position:0%
decisions this implements reasonable uh
 
03:50:50.389 --> 03:50:50.399 align:start position:0%
responsible and reasonable spending
 
03:50:53.750 --> 03:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
controls h675 also recognizes that
 
03:50:55.910 --> 03:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
education funding is not just about
 
03:50:58.469 --> 03:50:58.479 align:start position:0%
Revenue but about responsible spending
 
03:51:00.389 --> 03:51:00.399 align:start position:0%
this bill caps School District budget
 
03:51:02.469 --> 03:51:02.479 align:start position:0%
increases excluding facility
 
03:51:04.870 --> 03:51:04.880 align:start position:0%
construction so that annual increases
 
03:51:07.510 --> 03:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
align with either a three-year average
 
03:51:09.590 --> 03:51:09.600 align:start position:0%
change in student enrollment a
 
03:51:12.229 --> 03:51:12.239 align:start position:0%
three-year average of past
 
03:51:14.229 --> 03:51:14.239 align:start position:0%
Appropriations uh those are the two
 
03:51:17.710 --> 03:51:17.720 align:start position:0%
where is and then their spending can be
 
03:51:20.030 --> 03:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
overridden by this spending cap can be
 
03:51:23.309 --> 03:51:23.319 align:start position:0%
overridden by a 2/3 super majority vote
 
03:51:25.710 --> 03:51:25.720 align:start position:0%
of the local legislative body so in
 
03:51:27.070 --> 03:51:27.080 align:start position:0%
cities that would be the board of
 
03:51:29.550 --> 03:51:29.560 align:start position:0%
aldermen or in towns with Town meetings
 
03:51:31.149 --> 03:51:31.159 align:start position:0%
that would be the voters that show up in
 
03:51:33.269 --> 03:51:33.279 align:start position:0%
March April or May whenever their town
 
03:51:35.429 --> 03:51:35.439 align:start position:0%
meeting is hosted this provision
 
03:51:37.790 --> 03:51:37.800 align:start position:0%
protects taxpayers from Runaway spending
 
03:51:39.389 --> 03:51:39.399 align:start position:0%
while ensuring that schools still have
 
03:51:41.990 --> 03:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
flexibility to meet changing needs this
 
03:51:43.389 --> 03:51:43.399 align:start position:0%
legislation is about fairness
 
03:51:45.630 --> 03:51:45.640 align:start position:0%
sustainability and pred ICT ability it
 
03:51:47.349 --> 03:51:47.359 align:start position:0%
recognized that education in New
 
03:51:49.070 --> 03:51:49.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire must be funded but that
 
03:51:51.070 --> 03:51:51.080 align:start position:0%
funding must also be transparent and
 
03:51:53.269 --> 03:51:53.279 align:start position:0%
responsibly managed uh I know there are
 
03:51:54.990 --> 03:51:55.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of people that are here to speak
 
03:51:57.070 --> 03:51:57.080 align:start position:0%
on the bill in the varing aspects they
 
03:51:59.110 --> 03:51:59.120 align:start position:0%
might have disagreements with again this
 
03:52:01.510 --> 03:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
bill is a vehicle uh for the legislature
 
03:52:03.990 --> 03:52:04.000 align:start position:0%
if we choose to do so to respond to any
 
03:52:06.349 --> 03:52:06.359 align:start position:0%
pending court case that may be out there
 
03:52:08.229 --> 03:52:08.239 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions I know
 
03:52:09.710 --> 03:52:09.720 align:start position:0%
this has been an ongoing conversation
 
03:52:12.110 --> 03:52:12.120 align:start position:0%
we've had in the state and I I also just
 
03:52:13.469 --> 03:52:13.479 align:start position:0%
know that there's others here that may
 
03:52:15.309 --> 03:52:15.319 align:start position:0%
be more equipped answer the questions

you uh represent last year there was a
 
03:53:17.389 --> 03:53:17.399 align:start position:0%
amendment made in division 2 I believe
 
03:53:18.590 --> 03:53:18.600 align:start position:0%
it came
 
03:53:21.070 --> 03:53:21.080 align:start position:0%
from the chair of that committee at the
 
03:53:23.429 --> 03:53:23.439 align:start position:0%
time which had similar language here in
 
03:53:26.269 --> 03:53:26.279 align:start position:0%
fact how you process the swep money that
 
03:53:29.149 --> 03:53:29.159 align:start position:0%
re is access is this similar language
 
03:53:32.750 --> 03:53:32.760 align:start position:0%
that was in that yes okay thank you any
 
03:53:35.790 --> 03:53:35.800 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
03:53:35.800 --> 03:53:36.910 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
represent

03:53:36.910 --> 03:53:36.920 align:start position:0%
represent
 
03:53:39.269 --> 03:53:39.279 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:53:41.590 --> 03:53:41.600 align:start position:0%
for taking my question and I apologize I
 
03:53:42.389 --> 03:53:42.399 align:start position:0%
missed the beginning of your
 
03:53:45.149 --> 03:53:45.159 align:start position:0%
introduction so so testify
 
03:53:50.590 --> 03:53:50.600 align:start position:0%
f um I I just want to um confirm at the
 
03:53:52.750 --> 03:53:52.760 align:start position:0%
end of the bill page three lines 24 to
 
03:53:55.590 --> 03:53:55.600 align:start position:0%
26 or
 
03:53:58.790 --> 03:53:58.800 align:start position:0%
28 so that amendment is increasing the
 
03:54:00.870 --> 03:54:00.880 align:start position:0%
atmr but completely eliminating
 
03:54:04.189 --> 03:54:04.199 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid yes no additional
 
03:54:06.429 --> 03:54:06.439 align:start position:0%
coverage for any of the other categories
 
03:54:07.870 --> 03:54:07.880 align:start position:0%
that we currently provide additional
 
03:54:11.910 --> 03:54:11.920 align:start position:0%
funding for I I believe
 
03:54:14.910 --> 03:54:14.920 align:start position:0%
so for yes go ahead
 
03:54:16.710 --> 03:54:16.720 align:start position:0%
do you have any indication yet about the
 
03:54:21.269 --> 03:54:21.279 align:start position:0%
fiscal note I do not thank
 
03:54:24.309 --> 03:54:24.319 align:start position:0%
you further questions from the committee
 
03:54:26.870 --> 03:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
yes representative fellows oh yes thank
 
03:54:30.830 --> 03:54:30.840 align:start position:0%
you um I when I look at this on the the
 
03:54:34.469 --> 03:54:34.479 align:start position:0%
first section seems to me that what it
 
03:54:39.110 --> 03:54:39.120 align:start position:0%
does is say that the property tax payers
 
03:54:43.750 --> 03:54:43.760 align:start position:0%
which now pay the Statewide average the
 
03:54:44.830 --> 03:54:44.840 align:start position:0%
pay pay the
 
03:54:48.469 --> 03:54:48.479 align:start position:0%
Statewide uh education property tax will
 
03:54:51.149 --> 03:54:51.159 align:start position:0%
now have to pay twice as
 
03:54:55.030 --> 03:54:55.040 align:start position:0%
much so because that
 
03:54:58.510 --> 03:54:58.520 align:start position:0%
7773 million is pretty much twice what
 
03:55:00.990 --> 03:55:01.000 align:start position:0%
they're paying now so this to me looks
 
03:55:04.030 --> 03:55:04.040 align:start position:0%
to me like this shifts costs onto the
 
03:55:04.040 --> 03:55:05.429 align:start position:0%
to me like this shifts costs onto the
school

03:55:05.429 --> 03:55:05.439 align:start position:0%
school
 
03:55:05.439 --> 03:55:07.269 align:start position:0%
school
districts

03:55:07.269 --> 03:55:07.279 align:start position:0%
districts
 
03:55:10.710 --> 03:55:10.720 align:start position:0%
and um I also wonder why it's in the tax
 
03:55:14.469 --> 03:55:14.479 align:start position:0%
section it just sure I'll try best my
 
03:55:15.950 --> 03:55:15.960 align:start position:0%
ability to answer that you have to
 
03:55:17.910 --> 03:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
couple it with the local spending
 
03:55:19.510 --> 03:55:19.520 align:start position:0%
controls that are put in place by the
 
03:55:22.030 --> 03:55:22.040 align:start position:0%
legislation so the actual property tax
 
03:55:28.990 --> 03:55:29.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:33.510 --> 03:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
increase follow well yes so so that to
 
03:55:35.590 --> 03:55:35.600 align:start position:0%
me says that you're
 
03:55:35.600 --> 03:55:37.469 align:start position:0%
me says that you're
saying

03:55:37.469 --> 03:55:37.479 align:start position:0%
saying
 
03:55:40.229 --> 03:55:40.239 align:start position:0%
the this I understand that they don't
 
03:55:42.510 --> 03:55:42.520 align:start position:0%
that they won't have they this won't
 
03:55:45.269 --> 03:55:45.279 align:start position:0%
make their tax bill go up
 
03:55:48.630 --> 03:55:48.640 align:start position:0%
but on the other side what does it do to
 
03:55:51.070 --> 03:55:51.080 align:start position:0%
the adequacy a formula because the
 
03:55:52.950 --> 03:55:52.960 align:start position:0%
Statewide property tax is a component of
 
03:55:55.950 --> 03:55:55.960 align:start position:0%
the adequacy formula yep so it increases
 
03:55:59.830 --> 03:55:59.840 align:start position:0%
the adequacy Grant from 4,100 to the
 
03:56:04.149 --> 03:56:04.159 align:start position:0%
7,356 and a Penny thank you and further
 
03:56:06.710 --> 03:56:06.720 align:start position:0%
questions yes
 
03:56:09.389 --> 03:56:09.399 align:start position:0%
representa thank you Mr chair just to S
 
03:56:11.750 --> 03:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
up into confusion I don't believe this
 
03:56:13.830 --> 03:56:13.840 align:start position:0%
impacts the differentiated Aid if you
 
03:56:14.950 --> 03:56:14.960 align:start position:0%
read the
 
03:56:16.469 --> 03:56:16.479 align:start position:0%
sentence you'll notice that it's just
 
03:56:19.790 --> 03:56:19.800 align:start position:0%
replacing up to that point and it still
 
03:56:22.269 --> 03:56:22.279 align:start position:0%
continues to say differentiated Aid a
 
03:56:25.389 --> 03:56:25.399 align:start position:0%
cost of 7,000 blah blah blah per pupil
 
03:56:27.469 --> 03:56:27.479 align:start position:0%
plus differentiated 8 as follows and
 
03:56:29.349 --> 03:56:29.359 align:start position:0%
that then follows on in the law that as
 
03:56:32.550 --> 03:56:32.560 align:start position:0%
it exists now so it's only changing the
 
03:56:37.070 --> 03:56:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:39.469 --> 03:56:39.479 align:start position:0%
7300 thank you for the clarification and
 
03:56:41.070 --> 03:56:41.080 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm sorry I answered that question
 
03:56:41.080 --> 03:56:43.229 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm sorry I answered that question
incorrectly

03:56:43.229 --> 03:56:43.239 align:start position:0%
incorrectly
 
03:56:46.790 --> 03:56:46.800 align:start position:0%
earlier can I respond represent Damon
 
03:56:48.710 --> 03:56:48.720 align:start position:0%
yes thank
 
03:56:51.790 --> 03:56:51.800 align:start position:0%
you um I'm not sure if you answered it
 
03:56:55.630 --> 03:56:55.640 align:start position:0%
incorrectly or if the language is not
 
03:56:58.229 --> 03:56:58.239 align:start position:0%
clear because it sounds like it could be
 
03:56:59.670 --> 03:56:59.680 align:start position:0%
interpreted either
 
03:57:02.910 --> 03:57:02.920 align:start position:0%
way it says plus differentiated Aid as
 
03:57:04.990 --> 03:57:05.000 align:start position:0%
follows colon and then there's nothing
 
03:57:07.830 --> 03:57:07.840 align:start position:0%
here in the bill that follows
 
03:57:09.870 --> 03:57:09.880 align:start position:0%
so that looks to me like it doesn't
 
03:57:11.590 --> 03:57:11.600 align:start position:0%
include differentiated Aid which is what
 
03:57:12.870 --> 03:57:12.880 align:start position:0%
I wanted to
 
03:57:15.710 --> 03:57:15.720 align:start position:0%
clarify perhaps that me clarify others
 
03:57:17.110 --> 03:57:17.120 align:start position:0%
and that are going to come forth and
 
03:57:17.120 --> 03:57:18.590 align:start position:0%
and that are going to come forth and
testify

03:57:18.590 --> 03:57:18.600 align:start position:0%
testify
 
03:57:18.600 --> 03:57:20.349 align:start position:0%
testify
sure

03:57:20.349 --> 03:57:20.359 align:start position:0%
sure
 
03:57:24.189 --> 03:57:24.199 align:start position:0%
uh represent McGuire or I can I mean or
 
03:57:26.670 --> 03:57:26.680 align:start position:0%
sure you can so this is only replacing
 
03:57:30.750 --> 03:57:30.760 align:start position:0%
subparagraph a there's still a b c d etc
 
03:57:33.550 --> 03:57:33.560 align:start position:0%
etc right so yeah that's how we
 
03:57:36.429 --> 03:57:36.439 align:start position:0%
understood it yeah thank you thank you
 
03:57:39.590 --> 03:57:39.600 align:start position:0%

03:57:41.910 --> 03:57:41.920 align:start position:0%

a bill myself but wanted to get back
 
03:57:52.870 --> 03:57:52.880 align:start position:0%
down here as quickly as possible because
 
03:57:54.189 --> 03:57:54.199 align:start position:0%
I think there is a lot of interesting
 
03:57:57.429 --> 03:57:57.439 align:start position:0%
elements to this what and you and
 
03:58:01.550 --> 03:58:01.560 align:start position:0%
apologies if you already um discuss this
 
03:58:04.149 --> 03:58:04.159 align:start position:0%
but um it looks like you've defined
 
03:58:07.550 --> 03:58:07.560 align:start position:0%
Statewide base adequacy Aid as that
 
03:58:10.149 --> 03:58:10.159 align:start position:0%
calculation that comes out of
 
03:58:14.189 --> 03:58:14.199 align:start position:0%
1984a you know with the new base of 7356
 
03:58:17.030 --> 03:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
the the conval number um and then
 
03:58:19.830 --> 03:58:19.840 align:start position:0%
defining the Statewide propert education
 
03:58:25.229 --> 03:58:25.239 align:start position:0%
property tax that pays that as being uh
 
03:58:30.349 --> 03:58:30.359 align:start position:0%
68% of that that number is that correct
 
03:58:32.110 --> 03:58:32.120 align:start position:0%
that that would be correct okay thanks I
 
03:58:34.630 --> 03:58:34.640 align:start position:0%
want make sure add that on thank you

03:58:54.110 --> 03:58:54.120 align:start position:0%
card good afternoon Mr chair and
 
03:58:56.149 --> 03:58:56.159 align:start position:0%
committee members of Education uh
 
03:58:58.510 --> 03:58:58.520 align:start position:0%
funding committee my name is Eric power
 
03:59:00.149 --> 03:59:00.159 align:start position:0%
I'm from Brookline I'm here representing
 
03:59:01.830 --> 03:59:01.840 align:start position:0%
myself just want to give you a little of
 
03:59:05.030 --> 03:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
my background um I have lived in brookln
 
03:59:09.349 --> 03:59:09.359 align:start position:0%
for almost 31 years and um also an Air
 
03:59:11.790 --> 03:59:11.800 align:start position:0%
Force veteran of 30 years I served on
 
03:59:13.710 --> 03:59:13.720 align:start position:0%
hollbrook L Cooperative school board for
 
03:59:16.469 --> 03:59:16.479 align:start position:0%
three years I'm currently the president
 
03:59:17.710 --> 03:59:17.720 align:start position:0%
of the school district governance
 
03:59:20.389 --> 03:59:20.399 align:start position:0%
Association of New Hampshire and I'm
 
03:59:22.710 --> 03:59:22.720 align:start position:0%
starting my fifth year on the Brookline
 
03:59:25.149 --> 03:59:25.159 align:start position:0%
planning board and I think of all the
 
03:59:28.670 --> 03:59:28.680 align:start position:0%
bills we have this year I see this one
 
03:59:32.429 --> 03:59:32.439 align:start position:0%
as a as a big um big solution to a lot
 
03:59:35.389 --> 03:59:35.399 align:start position:0%
of challenges that the state has put
 
03:59:37.830 --> 03:59:37.840 align:start position:0%
forth um that we have now we have the
 
03:59:40.269 --> 03:59:40.279 align:start position:0%
housing crisis and I think the housing
 
03:59:44.269 --> 03:59:44.279 align:start position:0%
crisis is being driven a lot by the uh
 
03:59:46.070 --> 03:59:46.080 align:start position:0%
High property taxes which is being
 
03:59:49.550 --> 03:59:49.560 align:start position:0%
driven by the the school spending
 
03:59:53.349 --> 03:59:53.359 align:start position:0%
primarily and so I see this as a a
 
03:59:56.030 --> 03:59:56.040 align:start position:0%
solution to that um because what you're
 
03:59:58.149 --> 03:59:58.159 align:start position:0%
doing is you're increasing aid but
 
04:00:00.950 --> 04:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
you're putting in the necessary controls
 
04:00:03.429 --> 04:00:03.439 align:start position:0%
so that the aid actually will go to
 
04:00:05.189 --> 04:00:05.199 align:start position:0%
property tax
 
04:00:08.189 --> 04:00:08.199 align:start position:0%
relief if you just give more Aid what's
 
04:00:10.910 --> 04:00:10.920 align:start position:0%
been happening on the ground in school
 
04:00:13.070 --> 04:00:13.080 align:start position:0%
districts and I've seen it myself and
 
04:00:15.750 --> 04:00:15.760 align:start position:0%
I've seen it across the state is that
 
04:00:17.670 --> 04:00:17.680 align:start position:0%
spending just tends to go up and never
 
04:00:19.830 --> 04:00:19.840 align:start position:0%
goes to property tax
 
04:00:23.349 --> 04:00:23.359 align:start position:0%
relief so I think the part of the law
 
04:00:25.590 --> 04:00:25.600 align:start position:0%
that has the the
 
04:00:30.229 --> 04:00:30.239 align:start position:0%
2third uh majority vote to exceed the um
 
04:00:34.189 --> 04:00:34.199 align:start position:0%
to exceed the inflation based um cap if
 
04:00:36.790 --> 04:00:36.800 align:start position:0%
you will is a good thing because I think
 
04:00:39.790 --> 04:00:39.800 align:start position:0%
that will bring spending under control
 
04:00:41.750 --> 04:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
um and there will be budgeting that this
 
04:00:44.469 --> 04:00:44.479 align:start position:0%
the budgeting will come to meet that
 
04:00:46.670 --> 04:00:46.680 align:start position:0%
um I don't know about the donor towns I
 
04:00:48.990 --> 04:00:49.000 align:start position:0%
know there's some um you know there's a
 
04:00:51.670 --> 04:00:51.680 align:start position:0%
case at the Supreme Court I think it was
 
04:00:54.830 --> 04:00:54.840 align:start position:0%
smart for representative Sweeney to uh
 
04:00:57.790 --> 04:00:57.800 align:start position:0%
put that in uh depending on how you want
 
04:00:59.790 --> 04:00:59.800 align:start position:0%
to react to it I I go either way I'm not
 
04:01:02.389 --> 04:01:02.399 align:start position:0%
really uh for or against the donor towns
 
04:01:05.750 --> 04:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
I know the arguments on both sides um I
 
04:01:07.950 --> 04:01:07.960 align:start position:0%
did want to mention a couple of small
 
04:01:09.870 --> 04:01:09.880 align:start position:0%
things that might be looked at if you're
 
04:01:12.030 --> 04:01:12.040 align:start position:0%
looking at the language where it talks
 
04:01:14.309 --> 04:01:14.319 align:start position:0%
about you shall not have a voice Voice
 
04:01:17.950 --> 04:01:17.960 align:start position:0%
vote um on this 2/3 and I would like to
 
04:01:19.389 --> 04:01:19.399 align:start position:0%
point out that that might want to be
 
04:01:21.469 --> 04:01:21.479 align:start position:0%
strengthened a little bit because show
 
04:01:23.110 --> 04:01:23.120 align:start position:0%
of cards somebody might say well a show
 
04:01:25.030 --> 04:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
of cards isn't a Voice vote because it's
 
04:01:27.269 --> 04:01:27.279 align:start position:0%
not a voice but you might want to say
 
04:01:28.870 --> 04:01:28.880 align:start position:0%
something like it needs to be a ballot
 
04:01:30.710 --> 04:01:30.720 align:start position:0%
vote when you're going for the 2third
 
04:01:32.750 --> 04:01:32.760 align:start position:0%
override I think that would be important
 
04:01:35.389 --> 04:01:35.399 align:start position:0%
that's on page two line 15 and I think
 
04:01:37.110 --> 04:01:37.120 align:start position:0%
also the other piece of the legislation
 
04:01:39.870 --> 04:01:39.880 align:start position:0%
that would be important to clarify would
 
04:01:42.830 --> 04:01:42.840 align:start position:0%
be uh facilities acquisition and
 
04:01:45.710 --> 04:01:45.720 align:start position:0%
construction what does exactly mean for
 
04:01:48.469 --> 04:01:48.479 align:start position:0%
that do you is that certainly a new
 
04:01:50.630 --> 04:01:50.640 align:start position:0%
building a new school that would count
 
04:01:53.229 --> 04:01:53.239 align:start position:0%
as that um but what do you do about a
 
04:01:55.950 --> 04:01:55.960 align:start position:0%
renovation is that is that maintenance
 
04:01:59.189 --> 04:01:59.199 align:start position:0%
is that is that um construction what
 
04:02:01.309 --> 04:02:01.319 align:start position:0%
about what we're seeing now across the
 
04:02:03.389 --> 04:02:03.399 align:start position:0%
state a lot of these are doing what they
 
04:02:05.269 --> 04:02:05.279 align:start position:0%
call New green deals they're putting in
 
04:02:07.229 --> 04:02:07.239 align:start position:0%
solar panels and other sort of things
 
04:02:10.149 --> 04:02:10.159 align:start position:0%
that are maybe not really facilities but
 
04:02:11.590 --> 04:02:11.600 align:start position:0%
they're certainly being done and I've
 
04:02:13.550 --> 04:02:13.560 align:start position:0%
got two in my houseall Brookline Co-op
 
04:02:14.510 --> 04:02:14.520 align:start position:0%
this year
 
04:02:17.110 --> 04:02:17.120 align:start position:0%
being proposed and they're leasing them
 
04:02:19.429 --> 04:02:19.439 align:start position:0%
um so I think tightening up the language
 
04:02:21.309 --> 04:02:21.319 align:start position:0%
or at least defining what is facilities
 
04:02:23.910 --> 04:02:23.920 align:start position:0%
acquisition and construction mean what
 
04:02:26.149 --> 04:02:26.159 align:start position:0%
what goes into that is is it Bond things
 
04:02:28.349 --> 04:02:28.359 align:start position:0%
is it lease things um you want to be
 
04:02:30.030 --> 04:02:30.040 align:start position:0%
able to kind of make sure that there's
 
04:02:33.590 --> 04:02:33.600 align:start position:0%
no loopholes there on the um on the
 
04:02:36.990 --> 04:02:37.000 align:start position:0%
language and um you know that somebody's
 
04:02:38.750 --> 04:02:38.760 align:start position:0%
already answered the question that this
 
04:02:41.189 --> 04:02:41.199 align:start position:0%
um you know about RSA
 
04:02:43.670 --> 04:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
1984a it's really not changing anything
 
04:02:45.870 --> 04:02:45.880 align:start position:0%
there except for increasing the um the
 
04:02:50.389 --> 04:02:50.399 align:start position:0%
base adequacy aid from 4,100 to 756 $
 
04:02:55.269 --> 04:02:55.279 align:start position:0%
7356 the other a is remaining there um I
 
04:02:57.189 --> 04:02:57.199 align:start position:0%
think this could be a game Cher because
 
04:03:00.510 --> 04:03:00.520 align:start position:0%
I think you know the legislature and
 
04:03:02.110 --> 04:03:02.120 align:start position:0%
both sides of the aisle could agree we
 
04:03:04.750 --> 04:03:04.760 align:start position:0%
have a housing crisis and one of the
 
04:03:06.950 --> 04:03:06.960 align:start position:0%
major things I see being on a planning
 
04:03:09.950 --> 04:03:09.960 align:start position:0%
board you know people promote buying
 
04:03:11.790 --> 04:03:11.800 align:start position:0%
land and taking it out of service for
 
04:03:13.429 --> 04:03:13.439 align:start position:0%
conservation and the main thing they use
 
04:03:15.830 --> 04:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
is an argument is look it's going to
 
04:03:18.990 --> 04:03:19.000 align:start position:0%
avoid having this many students and
 
04:03:20.910 --> 04:03:20.920 align:start position:0%
that's definitely what's been happening
 
04:03:22.670 --> 04:03:22.680 align:start position:0%
that's that's the headliner whether you
 
04:03:24.070 --> 04:03:24.080 align:start position:0%
like it or not that's what's happening
 
04:03:27.189 --> 04:03:27.199 align:start position:0%
on the ground so you want to be able to
 
04:03:29.469 --> 04:03:29.479 align:start position:0%
um answer that and maybe there would be
 
04:03:32.590 --> 04:03:32.600 align:start position:0%
less resistance to housing and zoning
 
04:03:34.750 --> 04:03:34.760 align:start position:0%
and such if they knew that the extra
 
04:03:36.550 --> 04:03:36.560 align:start position:0%
students wouldn't bankrupt the town or
 
04:03:39.070 --> 04:03:39.080 align:start position:0%
the city and I think that having this
 
04:03:42.189 --> 04:03:42.199 align:start position:0%
Common Sense bill to help you know
 
04:03:44.110 --> 04:03:44.120 align:start position:0%
ensure that spending remain under
 
04:03:46.630 --> 04:03:46.640 align:start position:0%
control with an override Mech mechanism
 
04:03:48.750 --> 04:03:48.760 align:start position:0%
would be is a very good step and I'm
 
04:03:50.309 --> 04:03:50.319 align:start position:0%
really happy to see this bill like I
 
04:03:51.670 --> 04:03:51.680 align:start position:0%
said it's probably the most important
 
04:03:54.229 --> 04:03:54.239 align:start position:0%
bill in my view for helping the state
 
04:03:57.349 --> 04:03:57.359 align:start position:0%
move forward to uh get us back to more
 
04:03:59.469 --> 04:03:59.479 align:start position:0%
Prosperity thank you very much thank you
 
04:04:03.590 --> 04:04:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:07.110 --> 04:04:07.120 align:start position:0%
committee yes represent luno thanks very
 
04:04:08.830 --> 04:04:08.840 align:start position:0%
much Mr chair and thank you very much
 
04:04:11.070 --> 04:04:11.080 align:start position:0%
for joining us this afternoon um I want
 
04:04:13.790 --> 04:04:13.800 align:start position:0%
to go on a comment you made about um
 
04:04:15.870 --> 04:04:15.880 align:start position:0%
about every time the state sends money
 
04:04:19.189 --> 04:04:19.199 align:start position:0%
to um uh to school districts to reduce
 
04:04:21.429 --> 04:04:21.439 align:start position:0%
property taxes property taxes don't
 
04:04:23.429 --> 04:04:23.439 align:start position:0%
don't change so I I just have a couple
 
04:04:25.149 --> 04:04:25.159 align:start position:0%
of questions for you how many states
 
04:04:27.269 --> 04:04:27.279 align:start position:0%
have a higher property tax than New
 
04:04:29.670 --> 04:04:29.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm not sure about property
 
04:04:33.030 --> 04:04:33.040 align:start position:0%
tax in other states sorry okay so um
 
04:04:35.469 --> 04:04:35.479 align:start position:0%
would you follow yeah um it's a
 
04:04:37.510 --> 04:04:37.520 align:start position:0%
rhetorical question New Hampshire is one
 
04:04:39.630 --> 04:04:39.640 align:start position:0%
of the highest property tax in the state
 
04:04:41.590 --> 04:04:41.600 align:start position:0%
and I was wondering the the the second
 
04:04:43.790 --> 04:04:43.800 align:start position:0%
part of the question is um where do you
 
04:04:45.750 --> 04:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
think New Hampshire is in terms of its
 
04:04:49.229 --> 04:04:49.239 align:start position:0%
state share of uh funding of local of of
 
04:04:52.070 --> 04:04:52.080 align:start position:0%
public schools I know it's not among the
 
04:04:54.030 --> 04:04:54.040 align:start position:0%
top but I think this bill is helping to
 
04:04:56.510 --> 04:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
address that and I think it's dead last
 
04:04:59.710 --> 04:04:59.720 align:start position:0%
it's dead last so dead last state shair
 
04:05:01.910 --> 04:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
leads to highest property taxes the
 
04:05:04.830 --> 04:05:04.840 align:start position:0%
corelation represent luno we're you're
 
04:05:06.790 --> 04:05:06.800 align:start position:0%
you're you're presenting information
 
04:05:06.800 --> 04:05:08.349 align:start position:0%
you're you're presenting information
that's

04:05:08.349 --> 04:05:08.359 align:start position:0%
that's
 
04:05:12.550 --> 04:05:12.560 align:start position:0%
not no fair fair enough but I yeah but
 
04:05:14.950 --> 04:05:14.960 align:start position:0%
i' I'd be hope some somebody that's
 
04:05:17.710 --> 04:05:17.720 align:start position:0%
discussing um well I'll leave it at that
 
04:05:20.429 --> 04:05:20.439 align:start position:0%
yeah let's let's do that representative
 
04:05:22.710 --> 04:05:22.720 align:start position:0%
papovich thank you Mr chair in an
 
04:05:25.630 --> 04:05:25.640 align:start position:0%
attempt to um clear any confusion that
 
04:05:28.149 --> 04:05:28.159 align:start position:0%
may have recently happened here could
 
04:05:30.269 --> 04:05:30.279 align:start position:0%
you maybe give us a background on what
 
04:05:33.229 --> 04:05:33.239 align:start position:0%
makes you say that when um you know the
 
04:05:35.950 --> 04:05:35.960 align:start position:0%
the state sends more money to the towns
 
04:05:39.309 --> 04:05:39.319 align:start position:0%
property taxes don't drop I you know
 
04:05:41.349 --> 04:05:41.359 align:start position:0%
anything that happened recently that led
 
04:05:44.469 --> 04:05:44.479 align:start position:0%
you to that conclusion any basis
 
04:05:46.229 --> 04:05:46.239 align:start position:0%
I just look at uh thank you for the
 
04:05:48.469 --> 04:05:48.479 align:start position:0%
question representative the uh you know
 
04:05:50.830 --> 04:05:50.840 align:start position:0%
what I see is the tax effort never goes
 
04:05:53.790 --> 04:05:53.800 align:start position:0%
down even when the aid goes up they find
 
04:05:57.469 --> 04:05:57.479 align:start position:0%
a way to spend the money um and maybe
 
04:05:59.389 --> 04:05:59.399 align:start position:0%
there's a little bit of uh chump change
 
04:06:03.070 --> 04:06:03.080 align:start position:0%
that comes back but it's very small and
 
04:06:06.750 --> 04:06:06.760 align:start position:0%
the only way that you can force the uh
 
04:06:08.550 --> 04:06:08.560 align:start position:0%
the aid to actually go to tax relief
 
04:06:10.550 --> 04:06:10.560 align:start position:0%
when the state does a lot of work to
 
04:06:12.550 --> 04:06:12.560 align:start position:0%
give more Aid is to actually put some
 
04:06:15.990 --> 04:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
sort of cap and there was a a law that
 
04:06:17.710 --> 04:06:17.720 align:start position:0%
was passed last year and it's already
 
04:06:19.710 --> 04:06:19.720 align:start position:0%
been very popular and being proposed in
 
04:06:21.790 --> 04:06:21.800 align:start position:0%
many many school districts ac across the
 
04:06:25.269 --> 04:06:25.279 align:start position:0%
state it's RSA 325e the School District
 
04:06:28.189 --> 04:06:28.199 align:start position:0%
budget cap enabling legislation that's
 
04:06:30.030 --> 04:06:30.040 align:start position:0%
there's people that want to have that in
 
04:06:31.790 --> 04:06:31.800 align:start position:0%
place in many many school districts
 
04:06:33.110 --> 04:06:33.120 align:start position:0%
because they want to be able to have
 
04:06:35.630 --> 04:06:35.640 align:start position:0%
common sense budgeting so when you have
 
04:06:38.950 --> 04:06:38.960 align:start position:0%
a budget cap you actually are getting
 
04:06:40.429 --> 04:06:40.439 align:start position:0%
into the budget committee if you have
 
04:06:42.590 --> 04:06:42.600 align:start position:0%
one the school board's planning process
 
04:06:46.229 --> 04:06:46.239 align:start position:0%
and say look we can spend up to $12
 
04:06:49.389 --> 04:06:49.399 align:start position:0%
million and if you know your Aid's going
 
04:06:52.189 --> 04:06:52.199 align:start position:0%
to be you know $3 million or whatever it
 
04:06:54.870 --> 04:06:54.880 align:start position:0%
is you can you can actually PL to that
 
04:06:56.630 --> 04:06:56.640 align:start position:0%
and just saying oh we're getting 3
 
04:06:59.550 --> 04:06:59.560 align:start position:0%
million more from the state let's spend
 
04:07:01.670 --> 04:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
14 or almost 15 million and that's the
 
04:07:03.189 --> 04:07:03.199 align:start position:0%
problem so that's what I've seen in
 
04:07:05.309 --> 04:07:05.319 align:start position:0%
school districts is that it's seen as a
 
04:07:07.910 --> 04:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
windfall and it also got conflated a
 
04:07:09.990 --> 04:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
little bit with the pandemic and and all
 
04:07:13.269 --> 04:07:13.279 align:start position:0%
the funds that came in at the same time
 
04:07:16.030 --> 04:07:16.040 align:start position:0%
but in general there's not somebody
 
04:07:17.550 --> 04:07:17.560 align:start position:0%
standing up and saying hey let's give
 
04:07:19.990 --> 04:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
this to tax relief it's more of how can
 
04:07:21.750 --> 04:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
we spend it and that that seems to be
 
04:07:23.109 --> 04:07:23.119 align:start position:0%
the the
 
04:07:26.309 --> 04:07:26.319 align:start position:0%
trend I I have a question for you um on
 
04:07:28.229 --> 04:07:28.239 align:start position:0%
page two uh
 
04:07:31.710 --> 04:07:31.720 align:start position:0%
line 8 you're talking about a three-year
 
04:07:36.149 --> 04:07:36.159 align:start position:0%
average percent change in admr did you
 
04:07:37.990 --> 04:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
give any consideration to extending that
 
04:07:40.710 --> 04:07:40.720 align:start position:0%
out maybe to a five or a longer period
 
04:07:44.429 --> 04:07:44.439 align:start position:0%
of time to get that average
 
04:07:46.429 --> 04:07:46.439 align:start position:0%
I mean I I think that could be a tweak
 
04:07:48.830 --> 04:07:48.840 align:start position:0%
to the uh to the language I did not help
 
04:07:51.149 --> 04:07:51.159 align:start position:0%
with this bill I'm just an I'm an
 
04:07:53.469 --> 04:07:53.479 align:start position:0%
observation I I wish I did help with it
 
04:07:57.070 --> 04:07:57.080 align:start position:0%
but I did not but I think that the um
 
04:07:59.550 --> 04:07:59.560 align:start position:0%
having an average is good we do all know
 
04:08:01.830 --> 04:08:01.840 align:start position:0%
that across the New Hampshire on average
 
04:08:04.510 --> 04:08:04.520 align:start position:0%
most districts are losing students it's
 
04:08:06.030 --> 04:08:06.040 align:start position:0%
been a trend that's been going on for a
 
04:08:08.750 --> 04:08:08.760 align:start position:0%
long time but you could soften that a
 
04:08:10.670 --> 04:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
little bit by making that opening that
 
04:08:12.630 --> 04:08:12.640 align:start position:0%
window to five years if it made sense I
 
04:08:15.950 --> 04:08:15.960 align:start position:0%
wouldn't I would support that as well um
 
04:08:17.510 --> 04:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
I also think the inflation being
 
04:08:20.950 --> 04:08:20.960 align:start position:0%
averaged over a few years is good um
 
04:08:24.229 --> 04:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
that will also help you know in in
 
04:08:25.750 --> 04:08:25.760 align:start position:0%
Municipal budgeting what you're trying
 
04:08:27.630 --> 04:08:27.640 align:start position:0%
to do is you're trying to not Shock the
 
04:08:30.429 --> 04:08:30.439 align:start position:0%
taxpayer you're trying to keep things at
 
04:08:30.439 --> 04:08:31.389 align:start position:0%
taxpayer you're trying to keep things at
a

04:08:31.389 --> 04:08:31.399 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:08:33.870 --> 04:08:33.880 align:start position:0%
reasonable increase and to ask school
 
04:08:37.189 --> 04:08:37.199 align:start position:0%
districts and towns to stay within
 
04:08:39.990 --> 04:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
inflation that we're all underneath is
 
04:08:41.469 --> 04:08:41.479 align:start position:0%
common sense and that's what this
 
04:08:42.830 --> 04:08:42.840 align:start position:0%
legislation does and if there's an
 
04:08:43.950 --> 04:08:43.960 align:start position:0%
urgent need
 
04:08:45.950 --> 04:08:45.960 align:start position:0%
and 2/3 really agree we got to spend
 
04:08:47.870 --> 04:08:47.880 align:start position:0%
that extra money that provision is in
 
04:08:51.309 --> 04:08:51.319 align:start position:0%
here um but otherwise I think it will be
 
04:08:53.149 --> 04:08:53.159 align:start position:0%
this would be a this would there's many
 
04:08:54.630 --> 04:08:54.640 align:start position:0%
many people out there that are looking
 
04:08:56.830 --> 04:08:56.840 align:start position:0%
for this this to pass that's the number
 
04:09:00.429 --> 04:09:00.439 align:start position:0%
one thing I hear from taxpayers you know
 
04:09:01.910 --> 04:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
when is the tax relief coming from
 
04:09:04.070 --> 04:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
conquered so if you give the relief you
 
04:09:05.750 --> 04:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
also want to make it happen with the
 
04:09:07.710 --> 04:09:07.720 align:start position:0%
spending controls that's that's in this
 
04:09:10.309 --> 04:09:10.319 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you very much further
 
04:09:14.630 --> 04:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
questions represent uh Maguire then
 
04:09:14.640 --> 04:09:15.750 align:start position:0%
questions represent uh Maguire then
represent

04:09:15.750 --> 04:09:15.760 align:start position:0%
represent
 
04:09:18.550 --> 04:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
Damon so you brought up an interesting
 
04:09:21.469 --> 04:09:21.479 align:start position:0%
point about the average since the
 
04:09:24.349 --> 04:09:24.359 align:start position:0%
enrollment is declining the average
 
04:09:27.070 --> 04:09:27.080 align:start position:0%
would presumably be higher than current
 
04:09:30.189 --> 04:09:30.199 align:start position:0%
enrollment right so wouldn't that
 
04:09:33.790 --> 04:09:33.800 align:start position:0%
necessarily make the the first budget
 
04:09:35.670 --> 04:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
kind of a little higher than it would
 
04:09:38.670 --> 04:09:38.680 align:start position:0%
have been the previous
 
04:09:41.550 --> 04:09:41.560 align:start position:0%
year right because it'll be times a
 
04:09:44.309 --> 04:09:44.319 align:start position:0%
bigger number of students rather than
 
04:09:46.990 --> 04:09:47.000 align:start position:0%
the actual number of students thank you
 
04:09:48.870 --> 04:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire yes the sort of
 
04:09:50.950 --> 04:09:50.960 align:start position:0%
the moving average and I'm an engineer
 
04:09:53.149 --> 04:09:53.159 align:start position:0%
from my training so mathematics is
 
04:09:56.790 --> 04:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
something I'm good at um the you as as
 
04:09:58.429 --> 04:09:58.439 align:start position:0%
you have a decrease it's not going to
 
04:09:59.870 --> 04:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
decrease as quickly because you're going
 
04:10:01.830 --> 04:10:01.840 align:start position:0%
to have the sort of the history of the
 
04:10:04.910 --> 04:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
previous years so it also doesn't shock
 
04:10:07.149 --> 04:10:07.159 align:start position:0%
the school if it it goes down they tend
 
04:10:10.429 --> 04:10:10.439 align:start position:0%
to get more money per students even when
 
04:10:12.189 --> 04:10:12.199 align:start position:0%
they don't have them as they as they go
 
04:10:14.910 --> 04:10:14.920 align:start position:0%
away whether they it's just from natural
 
04:10:17.189 --> 04:10:17.199 align:start position:0%
uh demographics or if students are
 
04:10:19.349 --> 04:10:19.359 align:start position:0%
opting into the EFA program or whatever
 
04:10:21.469 --> 04:10:21.479 align:start position:0%
is happening it does protect the school
 
04:10:23.469 --> 04:10:23.479 align:start position:0%
district so it's sort of like moderating
 
04:10:26.109 --> 04:10:26.119 align:start position:0%
the whole Trend um and same thing with
 
04:10:27.830 --> 04:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
inflation inflation goes up really fast
 
04:10:29.469 --> 04:10:29.479 align:start position:0%
it also does the same thing it moderates
 
04:10:31.830 --> 04:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
it and when it goes down it moderates it
 
04:10:33.750 --> 04:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
thank represent
 
04:10:35.830 --> 04:10:35.840 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
04:10:38.269 --> 04:10:38.279 align:start position:0%
taking my question which has two parts
 
04:10:42.269 --> 04:10:42.279 align:start position:0%
so first are you aware of the recent
 
04:10:43.670 --> 04:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
vote in the care sergeant School
 
04:10:46.469 --> 04:10:46.479 align:start position:0%
District where a budget cap was
 
04:10:48.750 --> 04:10:48.760 align:start position:0%
proposed I am aware of the School
 
04:10:50.830 --> 04:10:50.840 align:start position:0%
District budget cap proposed in January
 
04:10:54.309 --> 04:10:54.319 align:start position:0%
by Kars Regional School District yes so
 
04:10:57.149 --> 04:10:57.159 align:start position:0%
then you know that that motion failed by
 
04:10:59.550 --> 04:10:59.560 align:start position:0%
92% um the budget cap was not
 
04:11:02.950 --> 04:11:02.960 align:start position:0%
appreciated and the parallel question
 
04:11:06.469 --> 04:11:06.479 align:start position:0%
that I have is would you comment
 
04:11:09.429 --> 04:11:09.439 align:start position:0%
on the state imposing a budget cap
 
04:11:10.950 --> 04:11:10.960 align:start position:0%
versus New Hampshire's long-standing
 
04:11:12.590 --> 04:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
respect for local control and
 
04:11:14.790 --> 04:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
communities determining what's right for
 
04:11:14.800 --> 04:11:16.670 align:start position:0%
communities determining what's right for
their

04:11:16.670 --> 04:11:16.680 align:start position:0%
their
 
04:11:21.189 --> 04:11:21.199 align:start position:0%
Community yes I think I I I agree the
 
04:11:22.429 --> 04:11:22.439 align:start position:0%
School District budget cap is a great
 
04:11:25.429 --> 04:11:25.439 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation it's being um
 
04:11:28.149 --> 04:11:28.159 align:start position:0%
proposed by many school districts I
 
04:11:30.469 --> 04:11:30.479 align:start position:0%
think the way we have our school
 
04:11:32.389 --> 04:11:32.399 align:start position:0%
district meetings whether they're annual
 
04:11:36.349 --> 04:11:36.359 align:start position:0%
or sb2 it does not lend well to adopting
 
04:11:39.229 --> 04:11:39.239 align:start position:0%
this kind of legislation and I think if
 
04:11:42.950 --> 04:11:42.960 align:start position:0%
the state is going to give Aid the state
 
04:11:45.550 --> 04:11:45.560 align:start position:0%
has the right to actually put some
 
04:11:47.429 --> 04:11:47.439 align:start position:0%
conditions on it and I think spending
 
04:11:50.990 --> 04:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
controls is what the people want uh what
 
04:11:53.469 --> 04:11:53.479 align:start position:0%
people do you know at a meeting at kirar
 
04:11:55.670 --> 04:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
my understanding that it was a it was a
 
04:11:56.550 --> 04:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
u you know it was one of these
 
04:11:58.309 --> 04:11:58.319 align:start position:0%
traditional meetings they have a charter
 
04:12:00.870 --> 04:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
I think and they uh but you still had to
 
04:12:03.229 --> 04:12:03.239 align:start position:0%
show up in person to vote how would it
 
04:12:05.149 --> 04:12:05.159 align:start position:0%
shown up if it was actually doing an all
 
04:12:06.670 --> 04:12:06.680 align:start position:0%
day vote might have been very different
 
04:12:08.189 --> 04:12:08.199 align:start position:0%
so you have a different sample set when
 
04:12:10.790 --> 04:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
you have these traditional meetings
 
04:12:14.309 --> 04:12:14.319 align:start position:0%
versus you have all day voting
 
04:12:14.319 --> 04:12:15.990 align:start position:0%
versus you have all day voting
further

04:12:15.990 --> 04:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
further
 
04:12:19.389 --> 04:12:19.399 align:start position:0%
questions not seeing thank you very much
 
04:12:21.910 --> 04:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
the next card we have here
 
04:12:21.920 --> 04:12:24.189 align:start position:0%
the next card we have here
is

04:12:24.189 --> 04:12:24.199 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:12:24.199 --> 04:12:26.070 align:start position:0%
is
Lil

04:12:26.070 --> 04:12:26.080 align:start position:0%
Lil
 
04:12:35.710 --> 04:12:35.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:38.550 --> 04:12:38.560 align:start position:0%
man do you have the red there you go
 
04:12:41.710 --> 04:12:41.720 align:start position:0%
thank you it's my first time um Mr
 
04:12:42.830 --> 04:12:42.840 align:start position:0%
chairman and members of the committee
 
04:12:44.269 --> 04:12:44.279 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for allowing me to
 
04:12:46.950 --> 04:12:46.960 align:start position:0%
speak today uh my name is lilm as I said
 
04:12:48.349 --> 04:12:48.359 align:start position:0%
and I am the school board chair of the
 
04:12:50.790 --> 04:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
Lebanon School Board uh for sau88 as
 
04:12:52.550 --> 04:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
well as the mother of two high schoolers
 
04:12:54.550 --> 04:12:54.560 align:start position:0%
at Lebanon High School um I'm speaking
 
04:12:56.309 --> 04:12:56.319 align:start position:0%
today in opposition to this bill
 
04:12:58.189 --> 04:12:58.199 align:start position:0%
specifically in opposition to its effect
 
04:13:00.269 --> 04:13:00.279 align:start position:0%
on local control of education and the
 
04:13:02.710 --> 04:13:02.720 align:start position:0%
means by which Aid is calculated um
 
04:13:04.189 --> 04:13:04.199 align:start position:0%
first I am most concerned with the
 
04:13:05.670 --> 04:13:05.680 align:start position:0%
proposed school funding limitations
 
04:13:07.870 --> 04:13:07.880 align:start position:0%
included in the language of this bill at
 
04:13:10.070 --> 04:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
its most basic level imposing funding or
 
04:13:12.349 --> 04:13:12.359 align:start position:0%
tax caps at the state level takes away
 
04:13:14.229 --> 04:13:14.239 align:start position:0%
local control of of Education from local
 
04:13:15.870 --> 04:13:15.880 align:start position:0%
boards and local vote voters and
 
04:13:17.990 --> 04:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
taxpayers which should be anathema to
 
04:13:20.149 --> 04:13:20.159 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire legislature indeed it
 
04:13:21.710 --> 04:13:21.720 align:start position:0%
is hard for me to see this bill is
 
04:13:23.349 --> 04:13:23.359 align:start position:0%
anything other than a textbook example
 
04:13:25.910 --> 04:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
of legislative overreach in addition as
 
04:13:27.269 --> 04:13:27.279 align:start position:0%
we have seen in other states such as
 
04:13:29.109 --> 04:13:29.119 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts or in cities in our own
 
04:13:31.309 --> 04:13:31.319 align:start position:0%
State such as Manchester the imposition
 
04:13:33.510 --> 04:13:33.520 align:start position:0%
of tax caps on school districts only
 
04:13:35.710 --> 04:13:35.720 align:start position:0%
ever results in teacher layoffs cutting
 
04:13:37.830 --> 04:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
core academic classes and reducing other
 
04:13:40.030 --> 04:13:40.040 align:start position:0%
vital programs such as art and music
 
04:13:41.710 --> 04:13:41.720 align:start position:0%
eliminating important positions such as
 
04:13:43.109 --> 04:13:43.119 align:start position:0%
Librarians and mental health
 
04:13:45.389 --> 04:13:45.399 align:start position:0%
professionals freezing salaries and
 
04:13:47.389 --> 04:13:47.399 align:start position:0%
ultimately gutting public education and
 
04:13:49.109 --> 04:13:49.119 align:start position:0%
hurting children by depriving them of
 
04:13:51.550 --> 04:13:51.560 align:start position:0%
the solid public education they deserve
 
04:13:53.149 --> 04:13:53.159 align:start position:0%
tying funding and tax caps to the
 
04:13:55.309 --> 04:13:55.319 align:start position:0%
Consumer Price Index does not in any way
 
04:13:57.269 --> 04:13:57.279 align:start position:0%
affect any increases in the costs of
 
04:13:59.070 --> 04:13:59.080 align:start position:0%
goods services and insurance that
 
04:14:01.269 --> 04:14:01.279 align:start position:0%
schools need for example the costs of
 
04:14:03.670 --> 04:14:03.680 align:start position:0%
which will undoubtedly continue to rise
 
04:14:05.109 --> 04:14:05.119 align:start position:0%
while schools buying power will
 
04:14:06.550 --> 04:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
effectively continue to decrease
 
04:14:08.349 --> 04:14:08.359 align:start position:0%
year-over year as a result of this
 
04:14:10.790 --> 04:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
proposed cap in particular the funding
 
04:14:12.630 --> 04:14:12.640 align:start position:0%
formula suggested here relies on a
 
04:14:15.109 --> 04:14:15.119 align:start position:0%
problematic variable this bill continues
 
04:14:16.670 --> 04:14:16.680 align:start position:0%
the tradition of using the average daily
 
04:14:19.070 --> 04:14:19.080 align:start position:0%
membership in residents or admr uh to
 
04:14:20.790 --> 04:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
calculate appropriation amounts in
 
04:14:23.469 --> 04:14:23.479 align:start position:0%
Lebanon our admr is often close to 1300
 
04:14:24.870 --> 04:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
students while our district enrolls
 
04:14:27.229 --> 04:14:27.239 align:start position:0%
over, 1600 students just because a
 
04:14:28.269 --> 04:14:28.279 align:start position:0%
portion of our students are not in
 
04:14:30.710 --> 04:14:30.720 align:start position:0%
school on a certain certain day in the
 
04:14:32.830 --> 04:14:32.840 align:start position:0%
fall when the admr is counted does not
 
04:14:34.229 --> 04:14:34.239 align:start position:0%
mean that our district is not then
 
04:14:35.870 --> 04:14:35.880 align:start position:0%
responsible for educating and
 
04:14:37.189 --> 04:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
instructing and providing critical
 
04:14:39.109 --> 04:14:39.119 align:start position:0%
services for the additional 300 plus
 
04:14:41.389 --> 04:14:41.399 align:start position:0%
students when they do attend to use the
 
04:14:43.790 --> 04:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
admr average to calculate any sort of
 
04:14:45.670 --> 04:14:45.680 align:start position:0%
funding cap immediately puts districts
 
04:14:47.389 --> 04:14:47.399 align:start position:0%
like mine that are growing at a
 
04:14:49.109 --> 04:14:49.119 align:start position:0%
disadvantage we will never be able to
 
04:14:50.750 --> 04:14:50.760 align:start position:0%
adequately educate all the students who
 
04:14:53.309 --> 04:14:53.319 align:start position:0%
are our responsibility if admr is used
 
04:14:54.950 --> 04:14:54.960 align:start position:0%
exclusively to calculate the funds
 
04:14:57.149 --> 04:14:57.159 align:start position:0%
available to the district making this
 
04:14:58.990 --> 04:14:59.000 align:start position:0%
proposed funding cap even more
 
04:15:01.590 --> 04:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
inequitable in theory this bill proposes
 
04:15:03.149 --> 04:15:03.159 align:start position:0%
that all additional funds raised by
 
04:15:04.590 --> 04:15:04.600 align:start position:0%
municipalities will be sent to the state
 
04:15:06.309 --> 04:15:06.319 align:start position:0%
and used to meet the increased per
 
04:15:09.349 --> 04:15:09.359 align:start position:0%
people cost of worth that $7,000 however
 
04:15:11.149 --> 04:15:11.159 align:start position:0%
to be perfectly Frank there has been
 
04:15:12.590 --> 04:15:12.600 align:start position:0%
little evidence that the state is
 
04:15:14.149 --> 04:15:14.159 align:start position:0%
interested in doing anything at all to
 
04:15:16.030 --> 04:15:16.040 align:start position:0%
increase per pupil spending and instead
 
04:15:18.070 --> 04:15:18.080 align:start position:0%
ample evidence that the state is
 
04:15:19.830 --> 04:15:19.840 align:start position:0%
rejecting any calls judicial or
 
04:15:21.590 --> 04:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
otherwise to increase funding for
 
04:15:23.790 --> 04:15:23.800 align:start position:0%
students so it is my fear that the funds
 
04:15:25.429 --> 04:15:25.439 align:start position:0%
collected under this bill will instead
 
04:15:27.109 --> 04:15:27.119 align:start position:0%
simply flow directly into the ever
 
04:15:28.990 --> 04:15:29.000 align:start position:0%
increasing and completely under
 
04:15:30.670 --> 04:15:30.680 align:start position:0%
scrutinized education Freedom account
 
04:15:32.950 --> 04:15:32.960 align:start position:0%
fund further de destabilizing and
 
04:15:34.429 --> 04:15:34.439 align:start position:0%
hobbling public education in New
 
04:15:36.550 --> 04:15:36.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I urge you to consider this
 
04:15:38.790 --> 04:15:38.800 align:start position:0%
blinding hypocrisy while the state
 
04:15:40.550 --> 04:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
appears to be fighting tooth and nail to
 
04:15:42.229 --> 04:15:42.239 align:start position:0%
reject its constitutional obligation to
 
04:15:44.070 --> 04:15:44.080 align:start position:0%
fund public education adequately in New
 
04:15:46.349 --> 04:15:46.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire this bill is simultaneously
 
04:15:48.469 --> 04:15:48.479 align:start position:0%
attempting to limit from on high the
 
04:15:50.070 --> 04:15:50.080 align:start position:0%
amount of funding local districts and
 
04:15:52.469 --> 04:15:52.479 align:start position:0%
school boards can raise for themselves
 
04:15:54.550 --> 04:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
please reject this um ill-conceived
 
04:15:56.790 --> 04:15:56.800 align:start position:0%
attempt to deprive local taxpayers and
 
04:15:58.229 --> 04:15:58.239 align:start position:0%
school boards of our ability to
 
04:16:00.269 --> 04:16:00.279 align:start position:0%
determine how to fund our Public Schools
 
04:16:02.149 --> 04:16:02.159 align:start position:0%
as we attempt to educate our families
 
04:16:02.950 --> 04:16:02.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your
 
04:16:04.710 --> 04:16:04.720 align:start position:0%
consideration thank you are you willing
 
04:16:06.790 --> 04:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
to take questions to the best of my
 
04:16:08.630 --> 04:16:08.640 align:start position:0%
ability sure are there any questions
 
04:16:10.389 --> 04:16:10.399 align:start position:0%
from the
 
04:16:12.910 --> 04:16:12.920 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing any great thank you
 
04:16:28.950 --> 04:16:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:31.750 --> 04:16:31.760 align:start position:0%
DDO thank you Mr chairman and members of

currently chair the education Coalition
 
04:16:44.950 --> 04:16:44.960 align:start position:0%
communities 2.0 which is a group of 21
 
04:16:47.830 --> 04:16:47.840 align:start position:0%
member cities and towns that have come
 
04:16:49.910 --> 04:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
together to ensure that any future
 
04:16:52.750 --> 04:16:52.760 align:start position:0%
Funding Solution for state aid to
 
04:16:56.389 --> 04:16:56.399 align:start position:0%
education does not unfairly mandate that
 
04:16:59.550 --> 04:16:59.560 align:start position:0%
tax money raised in one town be sent to
 
04:17:02.229 --> 04:17:02.239 align:start position:0%
another town to be appropriated by way
 
04:17:04.229 --> 04:17:04.239 align:start position:0%
of the Department of Revenue
 
04:17:07.590 --> 04:17:07.600 align:start position:0%
Administration as such my comments focus
 
04:17:10.670 --> 04:17:10.680 align:start position:0%
on primarily on the provisions re uh
 
04:17:13.950 --> 04:17:13.960 align:start position:0%
provision reinstating the owner receiver
 
04:17:17.149 --> 04:17:17.159 align:start position:0%
Community system on behalf of the member
 
04:17:20.429 --> 04:17:20.439 align:start position:0%
municipalities of our Coalition I appear
 
04:17:23.670 --> 04:17:23.680 align:start position:0%
before you today to oppose House Bill
 
04:17:26.710 --> 04:17:26.720 align:start position:0%
675 this bill seeks to yet again
 
04:17:30.229 --> 04:17:30.239 align:start position:0%
establish an unfair funding scheme that
 
04:17:33.630 --> 04:17:33.640 align:start position:0%
this legislature repealed in
 
04:17:35.870 --> 04:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
2011 uh that the New Hampshire
 
04:17:38.990 --> 04:17:39.000 align:start position:0%
legislature repealed in 2011 and
 
04:17:41.630 --> 04:17:41.640 align:start position:0%
considered and dismissed as recently as
 
04:17:45.429 --> 04:17:45.439 align:start position:0%
last legislative session House Bill 675
 
04:17:49.229 --> 04:17:49.239 align:start position:0%
has the same flaws as the past actions
 
04:17:52.269 --> 04:17:52.279 align:start position:0%
namely requiring towns to tax their
 
04:17:54.750 --> 04:17:54.760 align:start position:0%
citizens and give the money to another
 
04:17:57.229 --> 04:17:57.239 align:start position:0%
town with no accountability for how it
 
04:18:00.309 --> 04:18:00.319 align:start position:0%
is spent under this flawed scheme the
 
04:18:03.269 --> 04:18:03.279 align:start position:0%
state is saying every town must tax its
 
04:18:06.189 --> 04:18:06.199 align:start position:0%
citizens for education purposes through
 
04:18:09.389 --> 04:18:09.399 align:start position:0%
swep but not every town will be able to
 
04:18:12.790 --> 04:18:12.800 align:start position:0%
spend those dollars raised for education
 
04:18:15.790 --> 04:18:15.800 align:start position:0%
through swep in that Community I'd like
 
04:18:18.269 --> 04:18:18.279 align:start position:0%
this committee to know that every dollar
 
04:18:20.990 --> 04:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
currently raised through the swep is
 
04:18:24.149 --> 04:18:24.159 align:start position:0%
spent on local education purposes in all
 
04:18:26.870 --> 04:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire communities there is no
 
04:18:29.870 --> 04:18:29.880 align:start position:0%
such thing as excess dollars within
 
04:18:32.790 --> 04:18:32.800 align:start position:0%
education funding in our state under
 
04:18:35.469 --> 04:18:35.479 align:start position:0%
this bill millions of additional dollars
 
04:18:38.070 --> 04:18:38.080 align:start position:0%
will have to be raised by towns through
 
04:18:41.070 --> 04:18:41.080 align:start position:0%
the local property tax in the town I
 
04:18:45.269 --> 04:18:45.279 align:start position:0%
work for we currently raise
 
04:18:48.429 --> 04:18:48.439 align:start position:0%
$764,000 through the swept portion of
 
04:18:51.990 --> 04:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
our total tax rate all that money is
 
04:18:54.870 --> 04:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
used for educational purposes and we
 
04:18:57.670 --> 04:18:57.680 align:start position:0%
also spend additional funds for
 
04:19:00.149 --> 04:19:00.159 align:start position:0%
Education through the local education
 
04:19:03.950 --> 04:19:03.960 align:start position:0%
portion of the tax rate under this bill
 
04:19:06.469 --> 04:19:06.479 align:start position:0%
we will have to raise a little bit more
 
04:19:10.229 --> 04:19:10.239 align:start position:0%
than $1.6 million through the swep
 
04:19:12.790 --> 04:19:12.800 align:start position:0%
portion of the rate and then we will
 
04:19:15.990 --> 04:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
have to send approximately 1.3 million
 
04:19:17.870 --> 04:19:17.880 align:start position:0%
of that or
 
04:19:22.189 --> 04:19:22.199 align:start position:0%
81% back to the state once we send those
 
04:19:24.750 --> 04:19:24.760 align:start position:0%
funds back to the state we will have to
 
04:19:27.510 --> 04:19:27.520 align:start position:0%
raise that amount again through our
 
04:19:30.830 --> 04:19:30.840 align:start position:0%
local education tax rate to fund our
 
04:19:34.590 --> 04:19:34.600 align:start position:0%
schools that's a $1.79 per th000
 
04:19:37.670 --> 04:19:37.680 align:start position:0%
increase in our overall property tax
 
04:19:41.149 --> 04:19:41.159 align:start position:0%
rate and our taxpayers will have no say
 
04:19:45.349 --> 04:19:45.359 align:start position:0%
in how it how it is spent this bill Pro
 
04:19:48.670 --> 04:19:48.680 align:start position:0%
proposes having similarly situated
 
04:19:52.030 --> 04:19:52.040 align:start position:0%
municipalities being treated differently
 
04:19:53.790 --> 04:19:53.800 align:start position:0%
at this point I'd like to point out
 
04:19:56.550 --> 04:19:56.560 align:start position:0%
another issue that we see with this bill
 
04:19:59.590 --> 04:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
as raised last year during discussions
 
04:20:03.030 --> 04:20:03.040 align:start position:0%
of proposed funding bills and amendments
 
04:20:05.870 --> 04:20:05.880 align:start position:0%
as the amount of funding per pupil
 
04:20:08.830 --> 04:20:08.840 align:start position:0%
increases the number of so-called donor
 
04:20:12.309 --> 04:20:12.319 align:start position:0%
communities increases as well there are
 
04:20:15.510 --> 04:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
current ly 27 communities with so-called
 
04:20:18.670 --> 04:20:18.680 align:start position:0%
excess swept dollars as we look at the
 
04:20:20.950 --> 04:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
financial information related to this
 
04:20:24.870 --> 04:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
bill 47 communities would become donor
 
04:20:27.910 --> 04:20:27.920 align:start position:0%
communities by having to send additional
 
04:20:31.149 --> 04:20:31.159 align:start position:0%
dollars back here to conquer remember
 
04:20:33.750 --> 04:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
every one of those dollars will have to
 
04:20:36.710 --> 04:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
be raised again through the local
 
04:20:40.269 --> 04:20:40.279 align:start position:0%
education uh portion of the total tax
 
04:20:44.070 --> 04:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
rate if our towns do not want increase
 
04:20:47.229 --> 04:20:47.239 align:start position:0%
do not want increases in their total
 
04:20:50.510 --> 04:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
taxes then all education and Municipal
 
04:20:52.990 --> 04:20:53.000 align:start position:0%
priorities will be impacted our
 
04:20:56.229 --> 04:20:56.239 align:start position:0%
taxpayers will be forced to reassess
 
04:20:58.750 --> 04:20:58.760 align:start position:0%
School budgets with potential negative
 
04:21:02.229 --> 04:21:02.239 align:start position:0%
impacts on education programming this
 
04:21:05.109 --> 04:21:05.119 align:start position:0%
seems to be the opposite of the intent
 
04:21:07.750 --> 04:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
of any increase in education funding
 
04:21:10.389 --> 04:21:10.399 align:start position:0%
within our state members of the
 
04:21:12.590 --> 04:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
committee I urge you to reject this
 
04:21:15.990 --> 04:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
Bill's fallacy of free money from what
 
04:21:19.630 --> 04:21:19.640 align:start position:0%
some consider Rich towns do we really
 
04:21:22.030 --> 04:21:22.040 align:start position:0%
consider towns such as Freedom
 
04:21:25.990 --> 04:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
Bridgewater or Hein as rich communities
 
04:21:29.229 --> 04:21:29.239 align:start position:0%
they all donate funds under the
 
04:21:31.830 --> 04:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
provisions of this bill this bill
 
04:21:34.830 --> 04:21:34.840 align:start position:0%
creates winners and losers across the
 
04:21:37.389 --> 04:21:37.399 align:start position:0%
granite state and has a potential to
 
04:21:40.149 --> 04:21:40.159 align:start position:0%
negatively impact our Municipal and
 
04:21:43.030 --> 04:21:43.040 align:start position:0%
school budgets in many ways
 
04:21:46.389 --> 04:21:46.399 align:start position:0%
House Bill 675 creates an unfair
 
04:21:49.790 --> 04:21:49.800 align:start position:0%
redistribution of property tax revenue
 
04:21:53.109 --> 04:21:53.119 align:start position:0%
this failed policy has been tried before
 
04:21:56.630 --> 04:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
and repealed it does nothing but cause
 
04:21:58.750 --> 04:21:58.760 align:start position:0%
acrimony in our
 
04:22:01.229 --> 04:22:01.239 align:start position:0%
municipalities there's no inherent
 
04:22:04.550 --> 04:22:04.560 align:start position:0%
fairness accountability or fiscal
 
04:22:07.349 --> 04:22:07.359 align:start position:0%
responsibility in in this provision of
 
04:22:10.349 --> 04:22:10.359 align:start position:0%
the bill the bill simply takes education
 
04:22:12.590 --> 04:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
funding from one community and
 
04:22:15.990 --> 04:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
redistributes it to others thereby
 
04:22:18.950 --> 04:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
increasing the tax burden of some
 
04:22:21.950 --> 04:22:21.960 align:start position:0%
property owners in our state over
 
04:22:25.109 --> 04:22:25.119 align:start position:0%
others education Coalition communities

04:22:31.429 --> 04:22:31.439 align:start position:0%

that does not treat different towns
 
04:23:02.429 --> 04:23:02.439 align:start position:0%
disproportionately or differently thank
 
04:23:04.990 --> 04:23:05.000 align:start position:0%

concern do you have a list of the 27
 
04:23:19.550 --> 04:23:19.560 align:start position:0%
towns and also I think you said 47 towns
 
04:23:22.990 --> 04:23:23.000 align:start position:0%
that uh yes representative I we've
 
04:23:25.950 --> 04:23:25.960 align:start position:0%
worked with the I guess it was the doe
 
04:23:28.469 --> 04:23:28.479 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet and and we looked at the
 
04:23:30.510 --> 04:23:30.520 align:start position:0%
communities that would have negative
 
04:23:32.550 --> 04:23:32.560 align:start position:0%
numbers I can share that with the
 
04:23:33.950 --> 04:23:33.960 align:start position:0%
committee if you'd like I think that
 
04:23:35.389 --> 04:23:35.399 align:start position:0%
would be very
 
04:23:37.750 --> 04:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
helpful for there a questions represent
 
04:23:40.070 --> 04:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
Luna so thanks very much and I didn't
 
04:23:42.830 --> 04:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
hear the this isn't my question but
 
04:23:45.030 --> 04:23:45.040 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury your your the
 
04:23:46.790 --> 04:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
last part of your question was the list
 
04:23:49.269 --> 04:23:49.279 align:start position:0%
of I'm I'm looking to identify those
 
04:23:51.070 --> 04:23:51.080 align:start position:0%
towns that would be impacted by the
 
04:23:54.149 --> 04:23:54.159 align:start position:0%
incremental increase okay okay that
 
04:23:56.229 --> 04:23:56.239 align:start position:0%
would that would be become similarly
 
04:23:59.349 --> 04:23:59.359 align:start position:0%
situated I I can show our the way we
 
04:24:01.630 --> 04:24:01.640 align:start position:0%
looked at the spreadsheet representative
 
04:24:03.389 --> 04:24:03.399 align:start position:0%
okay and and then as far as as far as
 
04:24:04.870 --> 04:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
data like that goes I'd also be
 
04:24:06.870 --> 04:24:06.880 align:start position:0%
interested in seeing the the list of
 
04:24:08.630 --> 04:24:08.640 align:start position:0%
towns who are who are members of the
 
04:24:11.510 --> 04:24:11.520 align:start position:0%

we're talking about here abut but my
 
04:24:16.189 --> 04:24:16.199 align:start position:0%
question is is the um is the Statewide

education of property ta I'm sorry is
 
04:24:21.149 --> 04:24:21.159 align:start position:0%

you're
 
04:24:30.389 --> 04:24:30.399 align:start position:0%
concerned that's the title of it yes sir
 
04:24:33.590 --> 04:24:33.600 align:start position:0%

04:24:36.109 --> 04:24:36.119 align:start position:0%
tax rate that is set within each
 
04:24:39.189 --> 04:24:39.199 align:start position:0%
Community but does it work like a state
 
04:24:44.670 --> 04:24:44.680 align:start position:0%
tax uh it is an equalized uh tax uh that
 
04:24:48.349 --> 04:24:48.359 align:start position:0%
is levied as part of the local property
 
04:24:52.630 --> 04:24:52.640 align:start position:0%

there two lines are there two lines that
 
04:25:12.429 --> 04:25:12.439 align:start position:0%

04:25:15.429 --> 04:25:15.439 align:start position:0%
about a school tax line and a state
 
04:25:17.710 --> 04:25:17.720 align:start position:0%
property tax line yes representative
 
04:25:21.630 --> 04:25:21.640 align:start position:0%

04:25:25.269 --> 04:25:25.279 align:start position:0%
of the uh overall property tax rate that
 
04:25:29.389 --> 04:25:29.399 align:start position:0%
are used for the funding of uh education
 
04:25:31.429 --> 04:25:31.439 align:start position:0%
within a community there there is a
 
04:25:34.429 --> 04:25:34.439 align:start position:0%
Statewide education property tax and
 
04:25:38.070 --> 04:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
there is a local education tax rate as I
 
04:25:42.710 --> 04:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
referred to my in my remarks
 
04:25:45.950 --> 04:25:45.960 align:start position:0%
now represent Burton has Burton thank
 
04:25:48.309 --> 04:25:48.319 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question thank you Mr
 
04:25:53.269 --> 04:25:53.279 align:start position:0%
chairman in your view would a one
 
04:25:57.910 --> 04:25:57.920 align:start position:0%
formula system where all towns are
 
04:26:01.349 --> 04:26:01.359 align:start position:0%
evaluated on relative wealth tax Bas
 
04:26:04.189 --> 04:26:04.199 align:start position:0%
sped students what other variables if
 
04:26:07.189 --> 04:26:07.199 align:start position:0%
that one formula was applied to all
 
04:26:10.269 --> 04:26:10.279 align:start position:0%
towns would that be a better way to fund
 
04:26:13.510 --> 04:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
education than this peac maail way and I
 
04:26:16.550 --> 04:26:16.560 align:start position:0%
live in a donor town but I have a strong
 
04:26:18.389 --> 04:26:18.399 align:start position:0%
self-interest in education because I
 
04:26:19.590 --> 04:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
represent the University of New
 
04:26:22.030 --> 04:26:22.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but would one formula that we
 
04:26:24.990 --> 04:26:25.000 align:start position:0%
could devise and all agree on would that
 
04:26:28.389 --> 04:26:28.399 align:start position:0%
be much better than what we've got
 
04:26:32.309 --> 04:26:32.319 align:start position:0%
now well representative uh we're we are
 
04:26:37.269 --> 04:26:37.279 align:start position:0%
willing to look at any other uh format
 
04:26:40.229 --> 04:26:40.239 align:start position:0%
for the funding of Education here in the
 
04:26:42.950 --> 04:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
town as a group um
 
04:26:48.830 --> 04:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
we uh we are simply uh opposed to this
 
04:26:51.790 --> 04:26:51.800 align:start position:0%
donor receiver Community system because
 
04:26:51.800 --> 04:26:52.550 align:start position:0%
donor receiver Community system because
it

04:26:52.550 --> 04:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:26:56.630 --> 04:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
changes uh every year all the time so
 
04:27:01.149 --> 04:27:01.159 align:start position:0%
another way to calculate the state uh
 
04:27:04.510 --> 04:27:04.520 align:start position:0%
portion of the education funding sure we
 
04:27:06.269 --> 04:27:06.279 align:start position:0%
would we would look at it as an
 
04:27:08.030 --> 04:27:08.040 align:start position:0%
organization thank
 
04:27:11.630 --> 04:27:11.640 align:start position:0%

have offsetting revenues that go against
 
04:28:40.590 --> 04:28:40.600 align:start position:0%
those and then the remainder is what
 
04:28:42.750 --> 04:28:42.760 align:start position:0%
goes on to the tax rate
 
04:28:44.990 --> 04:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
simply no that's that's fine thank you
 
04:28:45.000 --> 04:28:46.229 align:start position:0%
simply no that's that's fine thank you
very

04:28:46.229 --> 04:28:46.239 align:start position:0%
very
 
04:28:48.630 --> 04:28:48.640 align:start position:0%
much I I have one question for those
 
04:28:52.349 --> 04:28:52.359 align:start position:0%
towns which are these quote Old donor
 
04:28:55.229 --> 04:28:55.239 align:start position:0%
towns and you have this excess money are
 
04:28:57.389 --> 04:28:57.399 align:start position:0%
they directing money to for example like
 
04:28:59.910 --> 04:28:59.920 align:start position:0%
funds for school building Aid or
 
04:29:02.790 --> 04:29:02.800 align:start position:0%
catastrophic Aid and and a dedicated
 
04:29:07.710 --> 04:29:07.720 align:start position:0%
fund so so there's a a a a purpose and
 
04:29:10.269 --> 04:29:10.279 align:start position:0%
use a a consistent purpose throughout
 
04:29:12.750 --> 04:29:12.760 align:start position:0%
the state how this additional dollar is
 
04:29:12.760 --> 04:29:14.550 align:start position:0%
the state how this additional dollar is
being

04:29:14.550 --> 04:29:14.560 align:start position:0%
being
 
04:29:18.550 --> 04:29:18.560 align:start position:0%
directed no representative
 
04:29:22.590 --> 04:29:22.600 align:start position:0%
um the the school budgets work the same
 
04:29:25.590 --> 04:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
way as what I just described as the town
 
04:29:28.910 --> 04:29:28.920 align:start position:0%
budget so they have a a meeting uh a
 
04:29:30.189 --> 04:29:30.199 align:start position:0%
school district meeting that
 
04:29:33.229 --> 04:29:33.239 align:start position:0%
appropriates x amount of dollars they
 
04:29:36.229 --> 04:29:36.239 align:start position:0%
have offsetting revenues which right now
 
04:29:39.389 --> 04:29:39.399 align:start position:0%
includes all of the swept money that is
 
04:29:42.670 --> 04:29:42.680 align:start position:0%
raised through the state uh education
 
04:29:45.830 --> 04:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
property tax portion of the tax rate
 
04:29:48.910 --> 04:29:48.920 align:start position:0%
that's applied to what the the school
 
04:29:51.670 --> 04:29:51.680 align:start position:0%
district appropriated and then the
 
04:29:54.309 --> 04:29:54.319 align:start position:0%
remainder is what is funded through the
 
04:29:58.469 --> 04:29:58.479 align:start position:0%
local education portion of the tax rate
 
04:30:01.469 --> 04:30:01.479 align:start position:0%
so so if you take oh I'm sorry so you
 
04:30:03.510 --> 04:30:03.520 align:start position:0%
would be opposed to taking that those
 
04:30:05.590 --> 04:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
funds which you have and putting them in
 
04:30:06.870 --> 04:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
let's say in either of those two
 
04:30:11.389 --> 04:30:11.399 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds to offset the costs of
 
04:30:13.710 --> 04:30:13.720 align:start position:0%
new construction so you would not for
 
04:30:16.229 --> 04:30:16.239 align:start position:0%
example if you're authorized a a a
 
04:30:21.189 --> 04:30:21.199 align:start position:0%
building aid grant of 35 3.5 million and
 
04:30:24.469 --> 04:30:24.479 align:start position:0%
you have in that fund $1 million the the
 
04:30:27.590 --> 04:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
grant will reduce to
 
04:30:32.630 --> 04:30:32.640 align:start position:0%
2.5 well yes we're we're opposed our
 
04:30:35.030 --> 04:30:35.040 align:start position:0%
Coalition is opposed to the fact that
 
04:30:37.630 --> 04:30:37.640 align:start position:0%
you would take what is currently being
 
04:30:42.030 --> 04:30:42.040 align:start position:0%
used for the overall school budget
 
04:30:45.189 --> 04:30:45.199 align:start position:0%
making us take a piece of that send it
 
04:30:48.030 --> 04:30:48.040 align:start position:0%
in because all that's going to do is
 
04:30:51.590 --> 04:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
take whatever dollars like my example of
 
04:30:54.710 --> 04:30:54.720 align:start position:0%
Waterville Valley that $1.3
 
04:30:57.469 --> 04:30:57.479 align:start position:0%
million would then come out of that
 
04:31:00.630 --> 04:31:00.640 align:start position:0%
revenue and Not only would we have to
 
04:31:04.109 --> 04:31:04.119 align:start position:0%
raise it in the swep portion of the tax
 
04:31:07.109 --> 04:31:07.119 align:start position:0%
rate but because we can't use it for
 
04:31:10.229 --> 04:31:10.239 align:start position:0%
education in our town we would have to
 
04:31:13.790 --> 04:31:13.800 align:start position:0%
raise it again in the local education
 
04:31:16.229 --> 04:31:16.239 align:start position:0%
portion of the tax
 
04:31:19.429 --> 04:31:19.439 align:start position:0%
rate this this money is already being
 
04:31:21.070 --> 04:31:21.080 align:start position:0%
used for
 
04:31:23.910 --> 04:31:23.920 align:start position:0%
schools thank you further questions from
 
04:31:23.920 --> 04:31:24.790 align:start position:0%
schools thank you further questions from
the

04:31:24.790 --> 04:31:24.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:31:28.030 --> 04:31:28.040 align:start position:0%
committee represent
 
04:31:30.790 --> 04:31:30.800 align:start position:0%
Ames I asked this question because I
 
04:31:32.229 --> 04:31:32.239 align:start position:0%
don't think it was said in your
 
04:31:34.229 --> 04:31:34.239 align:start position:0%
testimony or in any of the questions
 
04:31:36.590 --> 04:31:36.600 align:start position:0%
that were asked but uh and I think you
 
04:31:39.030 --> 04:31:39.040 align:start position:0%
know the answer to it I think I do too
 
04:31:42.830 --> 04:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
but uh there um
 
04:31:46.550 --> 04:31:46.560 align:start position:0%
you've talked about the swept tax and uh
 
04:31:48.550 --> 04:31:48.560 align:start position:0%
as you see it the
 
04:31:52.429 --> 04:31:52.439 align:start position:0%
unfairness of taking away the excess
 
04:31:55.269 --> 04:31:55.279 align:start position:0%
what we often call excess swept amount
 
04:31:58.750 --> 04:31:58.760 align:start position:0%
and sending it elsewhere in the state um
 
04:32:01.429 --> 04:32:01.439 align:start position:0%
but you haven't uh pointed out that the
 
04:32:04.389 --> 04:32:04.399 align:start position:0%
Superior Court a superior court judge
 
04:32:07.630 --> 04:32:07.640 align:start position:0%
has ruled that that system is
 
04:32:11.109 --> 04:32:11.119 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional and that an appeal
 
04:32:13.950 --> 04:32:13.960 align:start position:0%
challenging that ruling filed by the
 
04:32:17.349 --> 04:32:17.359 align:start position:0%
state is before the you uh New Hampshire
 
04:32:21.510 --> 04:32:21.520 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court uh and um arguments have
 
04:32:24.710 --> 04:32:24.720 align:start position:0%
been made on both sides and it's under
 
04:32:27.710 --> 04:32:27.720 align:start position:0%
advisement by that by that Court as to
 
04:32:30.149 --> 04:32:30.159 align:start position:0%
what uh the ruling will be I think it's
 
04:32:31.710 --> 04:32:31.720 align:start position:0%
important that that be on record would
 
04:32:34.109 --> 04:32:34.119 align:start position:0%
you agree that my I fairly summarized
 
04:32:37.429 --> 04:32:37.439 align:start position:0%
the situation we don't with only one one
 
04:32:40.670 --> 04:32:40.680 align:start position:0%
other thing uh representative I believe
 
04:32:42.590 --> 04:32:42.600 align:start position:0%
that the Superior Court judge found it
 
04:32:45.790 --> 04:32:45.800 align:start position:0%
constitutional we appealed that decision
 
04:32:50.389 --> 04:32:50.399 align:start position:0%
as a coalition the the donor receiver
 
04:32:53.990 --> 04:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
Community system that was our appeal to
 
04:32:56.790 --> 04:32:56.800 align:start position:0%
the state supreme court that was the ran
 
04:33:00.510 --> 04:33:00.520 align:start position:0%
decision that our argument to the
 
04:33:05.150 --> 04:33:05.160 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court was that um that that uh
 
04:33:06.750 --> 04:33:06.760 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry it he found it
 
04:33:09.070 --> 04:33:09.080 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional and we found it
 
04:33:11.109 --> 04:33:11.119 align:start position:0%
constitutional I'm sorry yes you are
 
04:33:11.119 --> 04:33:13.390 align:start position:0%
constitutional I'm sorry yes you are
correct

04:33:13.390 --> 04:33:13.400 align:start position:0%
correct
 
04:33:15.629 --> 04:33:15.639 align:start position:0%

04:34:23.070 --> 04:34:23.080 align:start position:0%

represent the towns of Plymouth Ashland
 
04:34:28.760 --> 04:34:30.189 align:start position:0%
represent the towns of Plymouth Ashland
and

04:34:30.189 --> 04:34:30.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:34:33.109 --> 04:34:33.119 align:start position:0%
holderness um I've passed around some

testimony
 
04:34:38.109 --> 04:34:38.119 align:start position:0%
um let's see
 
04:34:40.349 --> 04:34:40.359 align:start position:0%
here I'm going to start with just a
 
04:34:44.590 --> 04:34:44.600 align:start position:0%
little bit of History about the swep tax
 
04:34:46.629 --> 04:34:46.639 align:start position:0%
um and then I'll go into what my bill
 
04:34:50.709 --> 04:34:50.719 align:start position:0%
does uh 25 years ago in response to the
 
04:34:53.869 --> 04:34:53.879 align:start position:0%
state Supreme Court ruling that town
 
04:34:56.670 --> 04:34:56.680 align:start position:0%
that the state not local districts must
 
04:34:59.349 --> 04:34:59.359 align:start position:0%
pay the cost of an adequate education
 
04:35:02.150 --> 04:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
the state did two things it increased
 
04:35:05.390 --> 04:35:05.400 align:start position:0%
Aid to school districts and it invented
 
04:35:08.910 --> 04:35:08.920 align:start position:0%
swep swep which is the Statewide
 
04:35:12.390 --> 04:35:12.400 align:start position:0%
education property tax was created by
 
04:35:15.629 --> 04:35:15.639 align:start position:0%
changing the single line on people's
 
04:35:20.230 --> 04:35:20.240 align:start position:0%
property tax bills to show the local tax
 
04:35:21.990 --> 04:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
assessment of
 
04:35:24.789 --> 04:35:24.799 align:start position:0%
schools and it did what it did is it
 
04:35:27.670 --> 04:35:27.680 align:start position:0%
split that into two lines the local
 
04:35:31.070 --> 04:35:31.080 align:start position:0%
education's tax and the state tax the
 
04:35:34.390 --> 04:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
total tax assessment for education in
 
04:35:38.269 --> 04:35:38.279 align:start position:0%
each town did not change because the sum
 
04:35:41.150 --> 04:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
of those two lines was the same as what
 
04:35:44.070 --> 04:35:44.080 align:start position:0%
was on the the original line the state
 
04:35:48.070 --> 04:35:48.080 align:start position:0%
did not send out tax bills and the town
 
04:35:51.869 --> 04:35:51.879 align:start position:0%
still um the town was still the tax
 
04:35:54.629 --> 04:35:54.639 align:start position:0%
collector during the first few years of
 
04:35:58.551 --> 04:35:58.561 align:start position:0%
adequacy Aid towns had to remit excess
 
04:36:02.629 --> 04:36:02.639 align:start position:0%
sweep swept to the state excess was the
 
04:36:05.949 --> 04:36:05.959 align:start position:0%
amount that was raised by swep that
 
04:36:07.789 --> 04:36:07.799 align:start position:0%
exceeded the
 
04:36:11.949 --> 04:36:11.959 align:start position:0%
town's adequacy calculated base cost in
 
04:36:15.830 --> 04:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
differential Aid only that it exceeded
 
04:36:19.910 --> 04:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
that amount since adequacy Aid did not
 
04:36:23.470 --> 04:36:23.480 align:start position:0%
come even close to covering the cost of
 
04:36:27.590 --> 04:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
schools all towns still needed to raise
 
04:36:30.869 --> 04:36:30.879 align:start position:0%
a substantial amount of local education
 
04:36:34.230 --> 04:36:34.240 align:start position:0%
tax remitting the excess was highly
 
04:36:38.551 --> 04:36:38.561 align:start position:0%
unpopular and it was repealed in
 
04:36:43.470 --> 04:36:43.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:47.189 --> 04:36:47.199 align:start position:0%
swep has been called a virtual tax a
 
04:36:51.070 --> 04:36:51.080 align:start position:0%
phantom tax and smok and mirrors because
 
04:36:54.789 --> 04:36:54.799 align:start position:0%
it exists only on paper the state
 
04:36:57.910 --> 04:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
reports swept Revenue that it never
 
04:37:01.869 --> 04:37:01.879 align:start position:0%
collects and it rep reports a swept
 
04:37:04.830 --> 04:37:04.840 align:start position:0%
expenditure that it never pays
 
04:37:09.551 --> 04:37:09.561 align:start position:0%
out this bill will remove the swep line
 
04:37:12.910 --> 04:37:12.920 align:start position:0%
from property tax bills the total tax
 
04:37:17.150 --> 04:37:17.160 align:start position:0%
paid will be the same the change will
 
04:37:20.990 --> 04:37:21.000 align:start position:0%
be um an honest in transparent
 
04:37:23.470 --> 04:37:23.480 align:start position:0%
recognition that when local homeowners
 
04:37:27.390 --> 04:37:27.400 align:start position:0%
and businesses pay property taxes that
 
04:37:30.869 --> 04:37:30.879 align:start position:0%
is a local support of education and not
 
04:37:30.879 --> 04:37:31.910 align:start position:0%
is a local support of education and not
state

04:37:31.910 --> 04:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:37:35.109 --> 04:37:35.119 align:start position:0%
aid there are some more other reasons
 
04:37:38.310 --> 04:37:38.320 align:start position:0%
that um and this isn't even all of them
 
04:37:40.470 --> 04:37:40.480 align:start position:0%
that we might want to eliminate that
 
04:37:41.949 --> 04:37:41.959 align:start position:0%
swept from the tax
 
04:37:45.470 --> 04:37:45.480 align:start position:0%
bills municipalities are responsible for
 
04:37:50.310 --> 04:37:50.320 align:start position:0%
police fire roads welfare and schools
 
04:37:53.429 --> 04:37:53.439 align:start position:0%
their only significant source of Revenue
 
04:37:57.670 --> 04:37:57.680 align:start position:0%
is property taxes the state has many
 
04:38:01.869 --> 04:38:01.879 align:start position:0%
Revenue sources and options I believe
 
04:38:05.990 --> 04:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
towns should have the exclusive right to
 
04:38:09.269 --> 04:38:09.279 align:start position:0%
revenue raised from property
 
04:38:12.551 --> 04:38:12.561 align:start position:0%
taxes both the Claremont in the conval
 
04:38:16.470 --> 04:38:16.480 align:start position:0%
lawsuits sought property tax relief if
 
04:38:18.629 --> 04:38:18.639 align:start position:0%
swep is not
 
04:38:22.869 --> 04:38:22.879 align:start position:0%
eliminated we will see bills in this
 
04:38:25.789 --> 04:38:25.799 align:start position:0%
legislature seeking to increase the
 
04:38:30.230 --> 04:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
amount of swep increasing swep means
 
04:38:34.150 --> 04:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
increasing property taxes for everybody
 
04:38:36.750 --> 04:38:36.760 align:start position:0%
and reducing state
 
04:38:41.670 --> 04:38:41.680 align:start position:0%
aid I believe swep is unconstitutional
 
04:38:44.830 --> 04:38:44.840 align:start position:0%
because the equalized values used to
 
04:38:49.029 --> 04:38:49.039 align:start position:0%
determine the tax is um tax taxes are
 
04:38:53.551 --> 04:38:53.561 align:start position:0%
not uniformed towns are required to do
 
04:38:58.230 --> 04:38:58.240 align:start position:0%
revaluations every five years so each so
 
04:39:01.830 --> 04:39:01.840 align:start position:0%
each year about 20% of towns bring
 
04:39:04.830 --> 04:39:04.840 align:start position:0%
properties up to current market value
 
04:39:09.150 --> 04:39:09.160 align:start position:0%
the equalized valuation of a town raled
 
04:39:12.189 --> 04:39:12.199 align:start position:0%
one year ago is not comparable to that
 
04:39:15.869 --> 04:39:15.879 align:start position:0%
of a town revalued 5 years ago the
 
04:39:18.629 --> 04:39:18.639 align:start position:0%
attached Sunday Union Leader article
 
04:39:19.869 --> 04:39:19.879 align:start position:0%
from January
 
04:39:23.470 --> 04:39:23.480 align:start position:0%
26 illustrates this inconsistency in
 
04:39:23.480 --> 04:39:25.349 align:start position:0%
26 illustrates this inconsistency in
equalized

04:39:25.349 --> 04:39:25.359 align:start position:0%
equalized
 
04:39:29.310 --> 04:39:29.320 align:start position:0%
valuations also because swept tax rates
 
04:39:32.949 --> 04:39:32.959 align:start position:0%
are for one year swept tax rates for one
 
04:39:35.990 --> 04:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
year are calculated on equalized
 
04:39:40.310 --> 04:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
property values from 2 years earlier the
 
04:39:42.230 --> 04:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
rate is not
 
04:39:45.310 --> 04:39:45.320 align:start position:0%
uniformed also attached to my testimony
 
04:39:49.910 --> 04:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
that I um gave out to all of you is the
 
04:39:53.070 --> 04:39:53.080 align:start position:0%
Department's of of education's report
 
04:39:56.470 --> 04:39:56.480 align:start position:0%
which shows that those swep tax rates
 
04:40:01.750 --> 04:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:05.350 --> 04:40:05.360 align:start position:0%
equal this bill replaces swep with a
 
04:40:07.990 --> 04:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
local contribution within the adequacy
 
04:40:08.000 --> 04:40:08.868 align:start position:0%
local contribution within the adequacy
aid

04:40:08.868 --> 04:40:08.878 align:start position:0%
aid
 
04:40:11.948 --> 04:40:11.958 align:start position:0%
formula subtracting swep from each
 
04:40:14.990 --> 04:40:15.000 align:start position:0%
Town's cost of an adequate education
 
04:40:17.708 --> 04:40:17.718 align:start position:0%
reduces what the state pays in real
 
04:40:23.110 --> 04:40:23.120 align:start position:0%
dollars by $360 million each year this
 
04:40:26.070 --> 04:40:26.080 align:start position:0%
bill simply turns that around and
 
04:40:29.390 --> 04:40:29.400 align:start position:0%
acknowledges that what the state really
 
04:40:33.990 --> 04:40:34.000 align:start position:0%
pays is reduced because collectively
 
04:40:38.868 --> 04:40:38.878 align:start position:0%
towns are contributing that $360 million
 
04:40:42.190 --> 04:40:42.200 align:start position:0%
swep toward the cost of an ADD quit
 
04:40:45.550 --> 04:40:45.560 align:start position:0%
education it Al the bill also
 
04:40:49.830 --> 04:40:49.840 align:start position:0%
requires um each town to spend at least
 
04:40:51.750 --> 04:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
that amount of money on their school
 
04:40:54.070 --> 04:40:54.080 align:start position:0%
district each year that is not going to
 
04:40:56.470 --> 04:40:56.480 align:start position:0%
be a problem because they all spend way
 
04:40:59.788 --> 04:40:59.798 align:start position:0%
more than that already but it does put
 
04:41:03.230 --> 04:41:03.240 align:start position:0%
into the um law a guarantee that states
 
04:41:06.670 --> 04:41:06.680 align:start position:0%
are getting what the state considers um
 
04:41:09.628 --> 04:41:09.638 align:start position:0%
funding for an adequate education this
 
04:41:12.628 --> 04:41:12.638 align:start position:0%
this whole thing um makes the bill
 
04:41:15.868 --> 04:41:15.878 align:start position:0%
Revenue neutral for both the state and
 
04:41:15.878 --> 04:41:16.830 align:start position:0%
Revenue neutral for both the state and
for

04:41:16.830 --> 04:41:16.840 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:41:19.948 --> 04:41:19.958 align:start position:0%
towns this still Bill does not provide
 
04:41:22.868 --> 04:41:22.878 align:start position:0%
property tax relief but it does deal
 
04:41:25.390 --> 04:41:25.400 align:start position:0%
with the issue of donor towns and it
 
04:41:29.390 --> 04:41:29.400 align:start position:0%
will allow this legislature some time to
 
04:41:32.150 --> 04:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
study the impact of giant of the
 
04:41:35.788 --> 04:41:35.798 align:start position:0%
dramatic shifts in property tax values
 
04:41:39.708 --> 04:41:39.718 align:start position:0%
that have occurred over the last 3 years
 
04:41:42.030 --> 04:41:42.040 align:start position:0%
um there has always been
 
04:41:45.270 --> 04:41:45.280 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies and equalized valuation
 
04:41:47.270 --> 04:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
but because of what happened during
 
04:41:50.310 --> 04:41:50.320 align:start position:0%
covid with so many people moving into
 
04:41:53.868 --> 04:41:53.878 align:start position:0%
the state and paying very high um
 
04:41:56.470 --> 04:41:56.480 align:start position:0%
amounts of money for property um just
 
04:41:58.350 --> 04:41:58.360 align:start position:0%
exacerbated the
 
04:42:00.830 --> 04:42:00.840 align:start position:0%
situation as the union leader article
 
04:42:04.590 --> 04:42:04.600 align:start position:0%
points out owners of lower priced
 
04:42:06.910 --> 04:42:06.920 align:start position:0%
manufacturing homes have seen the
 
04:42:09.550 --> 04:42:09.560 align:start position:0%
greatest increases to their property
 
04:42:13.948 --> 04:42:13.958 align:start position:0%
taxes in most towns school taxes are
 
04:42:17.868 --> 04:42:17.878 align:start position:0%
half at least half of the tax bill we
 
04:42:21.110 --> 04:42:21.120 align:start position:0%
need to look for alternative measures of
 
04:42:24.070 --> 04:42:24.080 align:start position:0%
fiscal capacity that are less reliant on
 
04:42:24.080 --> 04:42:25.390 align:start position:0%
fiscal capacity that are less reliant on
equalized

04:42:25.390 --> 04:42:25.400 align:start position:0%
equalized
 
04:42:31.390 --> 04:42:31.400 align:start position:0%
valuation um um and um that could be we
 
04:42:34.670 --> 04:42:34.680 align:start position:0%
could be looking at income and U medium
 
04:42:37.510 --> 04:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
median home values just just as an
 
04:42:41.628 --> 04:42:41.638 align:start position:0%
example so that's explains my bill
 
04:42:43.510 --> 04:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
I'm thank you very much representative
 
04:42:45.590 --> 04:42:45.600 align:start position:0%
fellows are there
 
04:42:47.830 --> 04:42:47.840 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
04:42:51.470 --> 04:42:51.480 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing any thank you very
 
04:42:55.670 --> 04:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
much are there any other pink cards in
 
04:42:58.430 --> 04:42:58.440 align:start position:0%
it are there any other pink cards on
 
04:42:58.440 --> 04:43:02.230 align:start position:0%
it are there any other pink cards on
this

04:43:02.230 --> 04:43:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:05.230 --> 04:43:05.240 align:start position:0%
bill I will close this
 
04:43:08.990 --> 04:43:09.000 align:start position:0%
hearing and we're at
 
04:43:14.350 --> 04:43:14.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:21.070 --> 04:43:21.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:26.150 --> 04:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:28.910 --> 04:43:28.920 align:start position:0%
one yeah we got a half hour
 
04:43:28.920 --> 04:43:33.868 align:start position:0%
one yeah we got a half hour
here

04:43:33.868 --> 04:43:33.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:36.150 --> 04:43:36.160 align:start position:0%
um I don't even know if we have the do
 
04:43:38.830 --> 04:43:38.840 align:start position:0%
we have the C we don't have that we can
 
04:43:40.430 --> 04:43:40.440 align:start position:0%
exact anything I don't think it's on the
 
04:43:44.070 --> 04:43:44.080 align:start position:0%
bottom that calendar this go around this
 
04:43:44.080 --> 04:43:46.190 align:start position:0%
bottom that calendar this go around this
week

04:43:46.190 --> 04:43:46.200 align:start position:0%
week
 
04:43:55.390 --> 04:43:55.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:00.270 --> 04:44:00.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:03.110 --> 04:44:03.120 align:start position:0%
see no no I'm not going to do that right
 
04:44:05.110 --> 04:44:05.120 align:start position:0%
now see we have we have some schedule
 
04:44:08.948 --> 04:44:08.958 align:start position:0%
for Tuesday morning and that's we got a
 
04:44:12.628 --> 04:44:12.638 align:start position:0%
C also tomorrow
 
04:44:14.868 --> 04:44:14.878 align:start position:0%
I want find out where everybody is and
 
04:44:40.030 --> 04:44:40.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:40.040 --> 04:45:09.948 align:start position:0%

okay we're ready to keep rolling here
 
05:18:34.628 --> 05:18:34.638 align:start position:0%
folks uh we're ready to go ahead and
 
05:18:40.390 --> 05:18:40.400 align:start position:0%
open up the hearing uh at uh hb3 73
 
05:18:45.270 --> 05:18:45.280 align:start position:0%
734 that's modern math um it's 245 this
 
05:18:46.750 --> 05:18:46.760 align:start position:0%
bill is relative to the state of
 
05:18:49.270 --> 05:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
education property tax and the low and
 
05:18:51.590 --> 05:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
moderate income homeowners property tax
 
05:18:54.110 --> 05:18:54.120 align:start position:0%
relief program sounds like represent
 
05:18:58.788 --> 05:18:58.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:01.910 --> 05:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
bill how' you guess well we've talked
 
05:19:06.708 --> 05:19:06.718 align:start position:0%
about this homeowner stop before um so
 
05:19:10.948 --> 05:19:10.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:10.958 --> 05:19:12.830 align:start position:0%
 
thank

05:19:12.830 --> 05:19:12.840 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:19:16.670 --> 05:19:16.680 align:start position:0%
you I have passed around
 
05:19:20.628 --> 05:19:20.638 align:start position:0%
uh an out outline of my position my
 
05:19:22.310 --> 05:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
presentation of the bill I'm not going
 
05:19:25.350 --> 05:19:25.360 align:start position:0%
to go through this word by word I spare
 
05:19:31.628 --> 05:19:31.638 align:start position:0%
you that um and I also passed out a uh
 
05:19:33.670 --> 05:19:33.680 align:start position:0%
an article that I came across literally
 
05:19:36.990 --> 05:19:37.000 align:start position:0%
just a day or two ago just by chance um
 
05:19:39.190 --> 05:19:39.200 align:start position:0%
on a website uh
 
05:19:42.548 --> 05:19:42.558 align:start position:0%
done by Doug Hall an analysis of uh new
 
05:19:47.310 --> 05:19:47.320 align:start position:0%
inton New Hampshire's uh um situation
 
05:19:49.070 --> 05:19:49.080 align:start position:0%
particularly as it relates to excess
 
05:19:51.548 --> 05:19:51.558 align:start position:0%
swept and I I found it interesting I
 
05:19:54.150 --> 05:19:54.160 align:start position:0%
thought you might too uh so that's
 
05:19:56.590 --> 05:19:56.600 align:start position:0%
background music and you can look at it
 
05:19:59.910 --> 05:19:59.920 align:start position:0%
when you want um if you have time given
 
05:20:01.708 --> 05:20:01.718 align:start position:0%
all the other things that are cascading
 
05:20:03.628 --> 05:20:03.638 align:start position:0%
onto our
 
05:20:09.590 --> 05:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
tables um so uh this bill um has had a
 
05:20:12.030 --> 05:20:12.040 align:start position:0%
formal life and different with different
 
05:20:15.390 --> 05:20:15.400 align:start position:0%
numbers um it's slightly different uh
 
05:20:18.110 --> 05:20:18.120 align:start position:0%
from the previous two
 
05:20:22.830 --> 05:20:22.840 align:start position:0%
versions um each time in each session
 
05:20:27.350 --> 05:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
this bill has uh gone to interim study
 
05:20:29.350 --> 05:20:29.360 align:start position:0%
and then an interim study report has
 
05:20:32.548 --> 05:20:32.558 align:start position:0%
been issued saying it uh what's the
 
05:20:35.990 --> 05:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
right word um it
 
05:20:39.310 --> 05:20:39.320 align:start position:0%
uh is recommended for future
 
05:20:44.628 --> 05:20:44.638 align:start position:0%
legislation so um the delay relates to
 
05:20:48.150 --> 05:20:48.160 align:start position:0%
litigation um and uh throughout this
 
05:20:51.030 --> 05:20:51.040 align:start position:0%
period of time swept the Statewide
 
05:20:54.590 --> 05:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
education property tax has been under a
 
05:20:58.590 --> 05:20:58.600 align:start position:0%
dark cloud um related
 
05:20:58.600 --> 05:21:00.948 align:start position:0%
dark cloud um related
to

05:21:00.948 --> 05:21:00.958 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:21:00.958 --> 05:21:02.670 align:start position:0%
to
um

05:21:02.670 --> 05:21:02.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:21:06.910 --> 05:21:06.920 align:start position:0%
the belief by some uh strong opposition
 
05:21:09.548 --> 05:21:09.558 align:start position:0%
by others that it's an
 
05:21:12.868 --> 05:21:12.878 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional tax uh in the way in
 
05:21:15.390 --> 05:21:15.400 align:start position:0%
which it's administered and in the way
 
05:21:17.350 --> 05:21:17.360 align:start position:0%
in which I'd say the statute requires
 
05:21:22.270 --> 05:21:22.280 align:start position:0%
that it be administered which is um
 
05:21:26.948 --> 05:21:26.958 align:start position:0%
to uh Levy a Statewide tax uh rate on
 
05:21:31.150 --> 05:21:31.160 align:start position:0%
all property except utilities across the
 
05:21:35.708 --> 05:21:35.718 align:start position:0%
state um use the municipalities as the
 
05:21:39.190 --> 05:21:39.200 align:start position:0%
vehicle for uh sending out the bill and
 
05:21:42.830 --> 05:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
then having the revenue collected and
 
05:21:46.830 --> 05:21:46.840 align:start position:0%
instead of depositing it in the State
 
05:21:50.590 --> 05:21:50.600 align:start position:0%
Treasury retaining it um at the local
 
05:21:54.270 --> 05:21:54.280 align:start position:0%
level and um and sending it out to the
 
05:21:57.190 --> 05:21:57.200 align:start position:0%
school districts uh that serve that
 
05:22:00.150 --> 05:22:00.160 align:start position:0%
municipality so that's the current uh
 
05:22:05.990 --> 05:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
Arrangement swept is uh is um let me go
 
05:22:09.030 --> 05:22:09.040 align:start position:0%
through what swept is um it's a
 
05:22:12.670 --> 05:22:12.680 align:start position:0%
Statewide tax it's a state tax the levy
 
05:22:16.070 --> 05:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
um is a function of work that the uh
 
05:22:18.110 --> 05:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of education is charged
 
05:22:23.590 --> 05:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
with doing every uh municipality um um
 
05:22:26.510 --> 05:22:26.520 align:start position:0%
that uh is served by a school district I
 
05:22:28.310 --> 05:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
think every every
 
05:22:33.390 --> 05:22:33.400 align:start position:0%
municipality um it receives uh a warrant
 
05:22:37.868 --> 05:22:37.878 align:start position:0%
from the commissioner of Revenue and uh
 
05:22:42.390 --> 05:22:42.400 align:start position:0%
Acts pursuant to that to uh
 
05:22:46.750 --> 05:22:46.760 align:start position:0%
um include on the local tax bill a line
 
05:22:51.750 --> 05:22:51.760 align:start position:0%
for the swep tax and the swep tax rate
 
05:22:55.110 --> 05:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
is um is an equalized rate as it comes
 
05:22:58.670 --> 05:22:58.680 align:start position:0%
from the commissioner of the local
 
05:23:01.910 --> 05:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
municipality uh
 
05:23:06.868 --> 05:23:06.878 align:start position:0%
um sends that um builds that rate but
 
05:23:11.548 --> 05:23:11.558 align:start position:0%
now in in the local property value value
 
05:23:14.548 --> 05:23:14.558 align:start position:0%
um adjusted for the local property tax
 
05:23:18.030 --> 05:23:18.040 align:start position:0%
differences from the equalized level and
 
05:23:21.390 --> 05:23:21.400 align:start position:0%
uh and that goes to the uh taxpayer who
 
05:23:24.070 --> 05:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
pays it and then that money comes back
 
05:23:27.430 --> 05:23:27.440 align:start position:0%
as I said goes goes to the school system
 
05:23:32.430 --> 05:23:32.440 align:start position:0%
so uh in this bill um the
 
05:23:36.430 --> 05:23:36.440 align:start position:0%
excess uh would no longer um follow that
 
05:23:38.430 --> 05:23:38.440 align:start position:0%
route in fact none of the revenue from
 
05:23:40.510 --> 05:23:40.520 align:start position:0%
from the swep tax would follow that
 
05:23:45.868 --> 05:23:45.878 align:start position:0%
route the uh um money would be collected
 
05:23:48.788 --> 05:23:48.798 align:start position:0%
by the municipality but it would not be
 
05:23:51.990 --> 05:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
retained locally it would be sent in to
 
05:23:55.590 --> 05:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
a central location to the Department of
 
05:23:57.830 --> 05:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
Revenue Administration for deposit
 
05:24:02.470 --> 05:24:02.480 align:start position:0%
processing and deposit into the uh um
 
05:24:03.990 --> 05:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
education trust
 
05:24:07.310 --> 05:24:07.320 align:start position:0%
fund and then what happens to it after
 
05:24:10.750 --> 05:24:10.760 align:start position:0%
that would be a simple a function of the
 
05:24:10.760 --> 05:24:12.788 align:start position:0%
that would be a simple a function of the
U

05:24:12.788 --> 05:24:12.798 align:start position:0%
U
 
05:24:15.830 --> 05:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
um the system the laws that the state
 
05:24:17.948 --> 05:24:17.958 align:start position:0%
has in place for spending money out of
 
05:24:21.190 --> 05:24:21.200 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund um so it would
 
05:24:22.830 --> 05:24:22.840 align:start position:0%
go into a
 
05:24:25.510 --> 05:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
Statewide uh allocation
 
05:24:30.708 --> 05:24:30.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:34.948 --> 05:24:34.958 align:start position:0%
locally my bill this this bill makes one
 
05:24:39.150 --> 05:24:39.160 align:start position:0%
change uh right up front um for years
 
05:24:43.230 --> 05:24:43.240 align:start position:0%
now the uh except for one year the um
 
05:24:46.110 --> 05:24:46.120 align:start position:0%
swept rate has been determined as the
 
05:24:48.948 --> 05:24:48.958 align:start position:0%
rate that would produce on an equalized
 
05:24:52.390 --> 05:24:52.400 align:start position:0%
level um as applied to all property in
 
05:24:54.708 --> 05:24:54.718 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire except for
 
05:24:59.030 --> 05:24:59.040 align:start position:0%
exempt property and except for uh
 
05:24:59.040 --> 05:25:01.390 align:start position:0%
exempt property and except for uh
utilities

05:25:01.390 --> 05:25:01.400 align:start position:0%
utilities
 
05:25:05.230 --> 05:25:05.240 align:start position:0%
um that would produce at that rate uh
 
05:25:09.390 --> 05:25:09.400 align:start position:0%
$363 million and a couple of years ago 3
 
05:25:13.270 --> 05:25:13.280 align:start position:0%
years ago something like that it uh the
 
05:25:15.628 --> 05:25:15.638 align:start position:0%
the amount to be produced was $100
 
05:25:18.948 --> 05:25:18.958 align:start position:0%
million less than that $263
 
05:25:22.948 --> 05:25:22.958 align:start position:0%
million um but now we're at the 363 I
 
05:25:25.750 --> 05:25:25.760 align:start position:0%
think I got it right million doll level
 
05:25:28.110 --> 05:25:28.120 align:start position:0%
um for the current
 
05:25:33.868 --> 05:25:33.878 align:start position:0%
situation um and my bill makes that $363
 
05:25:37.390 --> 05:25:37.400 align:start position:0%
million uh subject to adjustment each
 
05:25:40.750 --> 05:25:40.760 align:start position:0%
year uh by uh a cost of living
 
05:25:45.628 --> 05:25:45.638 align:start position:0%
adjustment CPI adjustment um I was
 
05:25:48.270 --> 05:25:48.280 align:start position:0%
probably led uh to uh make that
 
05:25:51.270 --> 05:25:51.280 align:start position:0%
adjustment when I saw a graph that the
 
05:25:53.350 --> 05:25:53.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire fiscal policy Institute
 
05:25:57.110 --> 05:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
has in their fantastic book booklet that
 
05:26:00.230 --> 05:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
maybe all of you have received I hope so
 
05:26:04.030 --> 05:26:04.040 align:start position:0%
uh which shows the uh property tax
 
05:26:06.670 --> 05:26:06.680 align:start position:0%
Statewide property tax and the amount
 
05:26:08.990 --> 05:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
that it's collected adjust
 
05:26:13.548 --> 05:26:13.558 align:start position:0%
but for going back in time for uh value
 
05:26:16.110 --> 05:26:16.120 align:start position:0%
uh for the changes in the purchasing
 
05:26:20.470 --> 05:26:20.480 align:start position:0%
power of dollars and so um we have in
 
05:26:22.910 --> 05:26:22.920 align:start position:0%
this chart it's I can't show it to you
 
05:26:25.030 --> 05:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
it's too small
 
05:26:28.548 --> 05:26:28.558 align:start position:0%
um it it has at the end of the line in
 
05:26:32.390 --> 05:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
2024 the $263 million and then as you go
 
05:26:35.910 --> 05:26:35.920 align:start position:0%
back in time you go back and it gets it
 
05:26:39.150 --> 05:26:39.160 align:start position:0%
has more and more value going back and
 
05:26:41.310 --> 05:26:41.320 align:start position:0%
uh back in
 
05:26:46.030 --> 05:26:46.040 align:start position:0%
2008 it was uh if I can read this um
 
05:26:48.708 --> 05:26:48.718 align:start position:0%
just just shy of $600 million in terms
 
05:26:51.150 --> 05:26:51.160 align:start position:0%
of it value so you lose value every year
 
05:26:52.708 --> 05:26:52.718 align:start position:0%
when you've got a fixed amount you're
 
05:26:55.030 --> 05:26:55.040 align:start position:0%
raising every year that's what would be
 
05:26:59.190 --> 05:26:59.200 align:start position:0%
done and it's raised um by applying a
 
05:27:01.868 --> 05:27:01.878 align:start position:0%
lower and lower rate we're now now down
 
05:27:04.708 --> 05:27:04.718 align:start position:0%
to I think a $1 and something
 
05:27:09.230 --> 05:27:09.240 align:start position:0%
equalized um and uh when I
 
05:27:11.470 --> 05:27:11.480 align:start position:0%
started paying that rate because I came
 
05:27:15.070 --> 05:27:15.080 align:start position:0%
into the state in about year 2000 it was
 
05:27:19.788 --> 05:27:19.798 align:start position:0%
very close to $3 I think um so the rate
 
05:27:22.110 --> 05:27:22.120 align:start position:0%
goes down the same amounts produced and
 
05:27:25.190 --> 05:27:25.200 align:start position:0%
the value that's available for paying
 
05:27:29.270 --> 05:27:29.280 align:start position:0%
for school funding costs uh
 
05:27:34.948 --> 05:27:34.958 align:start position:0%
um that that is then paid for by swept
 
05:27:38.670 --> 05:27:38.680 align:start position:0%
um goes down and other sources have to
 
05:27:41.628 --> 05:27:41.638 align:start position:0%
pay the difference that the formula
 
05:27:44.270 --> 05:27:44.280 align:start position:0%
produces so um I thought it was a good
 
05:27:46.990 --> 05:27:47.000 align:start position:0%
idea to put in a a cost of living
 
05:27:49.230 --> 05:27:49.240 align:start position:0%
adjustment or CPI adjustment into the
 
05:27:51.750 --> 05:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
bill so that's that's in this bill
 
05:27:56.110 --> 05:27:56.120 align:start position:0%
otherwise it's the same system for uh
 
05:27:59.350 --> 05:27:59.360 align:start position:0%
determining what each Town should pay
 
05:28:01.470 --> 05:28:01.480 align:start position:0%
and the commissioner does the same job
 
05:28:05.628 --> 05:28:05.638 align:start position:0%
as before and the uh warms go out and
 
05:28:10.190 --> 05:28:10.200 align:start position:0%
the um local communities rais the money
 
05:28:13.230 --> 05:28:13.240 align:start position:0%
and then differently from now they remit
 
05:28:17.470 --> 05:28:17.480 align:start position:0%
it to the state um when it gets to the
 
05:28:22.190 --> 05:28:22.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:24.708 --> 05:28:24.718 align:start position:0%
um the money goes into the education
 
05:28:27.470 --> 05:28:27.480 align:start position:0%
trust fund under this bill and can be
 
05:28:27.480 --> 05:28:30.750 align:start position:0%
trust fund under this bill and can be
used

05:28:30.750 --> 05:28:30.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:34.310 --> 05:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
there the bill the current law provides
 
05:28:38.708 --> 05:28:38.718 align:start position:0%
for a um
 
05:28:42.990 --> 05:28:43.000 align:start position:0%
a a rebate to taxpayers based on certain
 
05:28:45.510 --> 05:28:45.520 align:start position:0%
standards low income it's called the low
 
05:28:45.520 --> 05:28:46.230 align:start position:0%
standards low income it's called the low
and

05:28:46.230 --> 05:28:46.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:28:46.240 --> 05:28:48.070 align:start position:0%
and
moderate

05:28:48.070 --> 05:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
moderate
 
05:28:52.070 --> 05:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
uh uh homeowner property tax relief
 
05:28:56.270 --> 05:28:56.280 align:start position:0%
program something like that and um that
 
05:29:01.750 --> 05:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
uh um program which is in place today um
 
05:29:05.030 --> 05:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
provides for relief from the swept tax
 
05:29:08.708 --> 05:29:08.718 align:start position:0%
this bill extends that relief to both
 
05:29:10.750 --> 05:29:10.760 align:start position:0%
the swept and the school
 
05:29:15.510 --> 05:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
tax um and provides relief for uh
 
05:29:19.350 --> 05:29:19.360 align:start position:0%
homeowners that taxpayers that are in in
 
05:29:24.390 --> 05:29:24.400 align:start position:0%
the U in the low to moderate income
 
05:29:27.590 --> 05:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
income ranges that are in the Bill uh
 
05:29:30.110 --> 05:29:30.120 align:start position:0%
and it applies to property up to a
 
05:29:34.270 --> 05:29:34.280 align:start position:0%
certain value but not above that um and
 
05:29:37.510 --> 05:29:37.520 align:start position:0%
uh you can go into the details uh by
 
05:29:39.150 --> 05:29:39.160 align:start position:0%
looking through the bill itself and my
 
05:29:42.470 --> 05:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
testimony I tried to lay it out as EAS
 
05:29:46.910 --> 05:29:46.920 align:start position:0%
as as best I could uh there's a a cap on
 
05:29:50.708 --> 05:29:50.718 align:start position:0%
uh how much can be spent uh to make sure
 
05:29:53.830 --> 05:29:53.840 align:start position:0%
we don't go um we provide an
 
05:29:56.628 --> 05:29:56.638 align:start position:0%
unreasonable cost on on the state is $30
 
05:29:59.590 --> 05:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
million which is about equal to the
 
05:30:02.510 --> 05:30:02.520 align:start position:0%
excess swep money that's expected uh to
 
05:30:07.470 --> 05:30:07.480 align:start position:0%
come back into the uh uh State's hands
 
05:30:07.480 --> 05:30:08.548 align:start position:0%
come back into the uh uh State's hands
uh

05:30:08.548 --> 05:30:08.558 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:30:13.230 --> 05:30:13.240 align:start position:0%
um with the uh with the end of the swept
 
05:30:13.240 --> 05:30:14.350 align:start position:0%
um with the uh with the end of the swept
uh

05:30:14.350 --> 05:30:14.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:30:18.590 --> 05:30:18.600 align:start position:0%
retention so um I think I've
 
05:30:22.628 --> 05:30:22.638 align:start position:0%
covered the main elements of the bill uh
 
05:30:25.830 --> 05:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
and I realize I'm
 
05:30:28.830 --> 05:30:28.840 align:start position:0%
um dealing with detail at a very general
 
05:30:32.548 --> 05:30:32.558 align:start position:0%
level so I apologize for that um and
 
05:30:34.190 --> 05:30:34.200 align:start position:0%
there is one other provision in the bill
 
05:30:36.708 --> 05:30:36.718 align:start position:0%
it's a study committee on property tax
 
05:30:38.628 --> 05:30:38.638 align:start position:0%
relief that
 
05:30:44.830 --> 05:30:44.840 align:start position:0%
um is to look at um the situation of
 
05:30:44.840 --> 05:30:45.708 align:start position:0%
um is to look at um the situation of
rent

05:30:45.708 --> 05:30:45.718 align:start position:0%
rent
 
05:30:50.708 --> 05:30:50.718 align:start position:0%
payers um which uh whose rent is
 
05:30:53.230 --> 05:30:53.240 align:start position:0%
undoubtedly affected by property tax
 
05:30:57.628 --> 05:30:57.638 align:start position:0%
rates how how should the rent payer be
 
05:31:00.230 --> 05:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
um how should the rent rent payer's
 
05:31:02.670 --> 05:31:02.680 align:start position:0%
situation the tenants
 
05:31:06.070 --> 05:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
situation um be addressed so there some
 
05:31:08.670 --> 05:31:08.680 align:start position:0%
Fair some element of that relief that
 
05:31:13.190 --> 05:31:13.200 align:start position:0%
I've just spoken about could uh could um
 
05:31:15.788 --> 05:31:15.798 align:start position:0%
help them help them in their
 
05:31:15.798 --> 05:31:17.670 align:start position:0%
help them help them in their
situation

05:31:17.670 --> 05:31:17.680 align:start position:0%
situation
 
05:31:20.788 --> 05:31:20.798 align:start position:0%
um that's it I do have on the back of
 
05:31:25.110 --> 05:31:25.120 align:start position:0%
this the last year's uh uh report by the
 
05:31:27.430 --> 05:31:27.440 align:start position:0%
Ways and Means Committee last year this
 
05:31:30.350 --> 05:31:30.360 align:start position:0%
was the last two sessions this bill was
 
05:31:35.470 --> 05:31:35.480 align:start position:0%
in ways and means and um my esteemed
 
05:31:38.670 --> 05:31:38.680 align:start position:0%
colleague who's facing me uh um wrote
 
05:31:42.190 --> 05:31:42.200 align:start position:0%
this report and um we work together on
 
05:31:48.830 --> 05:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
this um and uh um it does it summarizes
 
05:31:51.150 --> 05:31:51.160 align:start position:0%
the bill that was in uh before the
 
05:31:52.868 --> 05:31:52.878 align:start position:0%
committee at that
 
05:31:55.750 --> 05:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
time so that's that's my testimony I
 
05:31:57.628 --> 05:31:57.638 align:start position:0%
think I'll leave it at
 
05:32:00.430 --> 05:32:00.440 align:start position:0%
that thank you very much uh representes
 
05:32:01.990 --> 05:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
I have one question and I'll turn over
 
05:32:05.030 --> 05:32:05.040 align:start position:0%
your um when it comes to these refunds
 
05:32:07.070 --> 05:32:07.080 align:start position:0%
from your tax bill like the veterans get
 
05:32:08.948 --> 05:32:08.958 align:start position:0%
or concurrent
 
05:32:11.670 --> 05:32:11.680 align:start position:0%
current use and all that other are you
 
05:32:14.948 --> 05:32:14.958 align:start position:0%
talking about the same type of a of a
 
05:32:18.510 --> 05:32:18.520 align:start position:0%
deduct like a veteran's up to $500 or is
 
05:32:20.390 --> 05:32:20.400 align:start position:0%
it coming off the assessed property
 
05:32:23.670 --> 05:32:23.680 align:start position:0%
values how's that going to work the this
 
05:32:25.708 --> 05:32:25.718 align:start position:0%
refund that you talk about on page two
 
05:32:29.270 --> 05:32:29.280 align:start position:0%
line nine we we have exactly the system
 
05:32:32.350 --> 05:32:32.360 align:start position:0%
in place right now it's very low level
 
05:32:35.310 --> 05:32:35.320 align:start position:0%
because it's only against the swep tax
 
05:32:37.470 --> 05:32:37.480 align:start position:0%
which is a relatively small amount
 
05:32:39.510 --> 05:32:39.520 align:start position:0%
compared compared to say Jeffrey which
 
05:32:42.470 --> 05:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
is much much more for the school tax and
 
05:32:46.548 --> 05:32:46.558 align:start position:0%
for the other taxes on the bill um and
 
05:32:50.470 --> 05:32:50.480 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a rebate from what uh the
 
05:32:55.310 --> 05:32:55.320 align:start position:0%
taxpayer is build and pays and uh the
 
05:33:00.590 --> 05:33:00.600 align:start position:0%
taxpayer has to go through a a process
 
05:33:04.270 --> 05:33:04.280 align:start position:0%
of asking for the rebate and there's
 
05:33:07.390 --> 05:33:07.400 align:start position:0%
form for that the M municipalities right
 
05:33:11.670 --> 05:33:11.680 align:start position:0%
now are obligated to advertise this to
 
05:33:16.070 --> 05:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
make it as easy as possible for the uh
 
05:33:20.510 --> 05:33:20.520 align:start position:0%
taxpayer to request this where where the
 
05:33:22.990 --> 05:33:23.000 align:start position:0%
uh numbers fit where the taxpayer is
 
05:33:27.390 --> 05:33:27.400 align:start position:0%
eligible and uh then that um relief in
 
05:33:30.470 --> 05:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
the end is processed by the Dr and
 
05:33:33.548 --> 05:33:33.558 align:start position:0%
they've got a set up for this so they
 
05:33:37.868 --> 05:33:37.878 align:start position:0%
they they process it and uh and then uh
 
05:33:41.190 --> 05:33:41.200 align:start position:0%
relief is sent out from the uh from the
 
05:33:43.270 --> 05:33:43.280 align:start position:0%
I believe from the state level I'm not
 
05:33:46.470 --> 05:33:46.480 align:start position:0%
sure that I think so so the last one I
 
05:33:50.070 --> 05:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
have if if we're going to ask the towns
 
05:33:52.750 --> 05:33:52.760 align:start position:0%
that have excess funds to return it to
 
05:33:55.830 --> 05:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
the state are are the towns going to be
 
05:33:59.910 --> 05:33:59.920 align:start position:0%
allocate afforded a a processing fee for
 
05:34:02.948 --> 05:34:02.958 align:start position:0%
handling this Gathering it processing it
 
05:34:04.390 --> 05:34:04.400 align:start position:0%
and sending in or are they just going to
 
05:34:06.628 --> 05:34:06.638 align:start position:0%
have to do it on their own accord well
 
05:34:08.750 --> 05:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
it's a good question I I did propose
 
05:34:11.948 --> 05:34:11.958 align:start position:0%
that in the previous bill was a 3% uh
 
05:34:15.270 --> 05:34:15.280 align:start position:0%
collection fee that could be put back in
 
05:34:17.910 --> 05:34:17.920 align:start position:0%
I think it be' be fine I there's one
 
05:34:21.470 --> 05:34:21.480 align:start position:0%
other change in this bill uh which which
 
05:34:26.430 --> 05:34:26.440 align:start position:0%
um requires uh that requires the
 
05:34:28.628 --> 05:34:28.638 align:start position:0%
remittance to be in four payments
 
05:34:32.270 --> 05:34:32.280 align:start position:0%
through the year and um that the
 
05:34:34.190 --> 05:34:34.200 align:start position:0%
schedule is to be worked out by the
 
05:34:36.150 --> 05:34:36.160 align:start position:0%
commissioner of
 
05:34:38.310 --> 05:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
Revenue uh in
 
05:34:40.548 --> 05:34:40.558 align:start position:0%
uh through discussions after discussions
 
05:34:44.150 --> 05:34:44.160 align:start position:0%
with the municipalities and the uh
 
05:34:46.430 --> 05:34:46.440 align:start position:0%
thought there is that there will be cash
 
05:34:48.470 --> 05:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
on hand that will be invested and
 
05:34:50.948 --> 05:34:50.958 align:start position:0%
produced interest uh that the
 
05:34:52.948 --> 05:34:52.958 align:start position:0%
municipalities will have before they
 
05:34:55.708 --> 05:34:55.718 align:start position:0%
have to remit it and maybe that would uh
 
05:34:59.270 --> 05:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
help pay at least pay in part some of
 
05:35:01.110 --> 05:35:01.120 align:start position:0%
these costs but that's something that
 
05:35:03.350 --> 05:35:03.360 align:start position:0%
that surely can be looked at thank you
 
05:35:05.910 --> 05:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
represent Maguire thank you Mr chairman
 
05:35:08.150 --> 05:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Ames uh
 
05:35:10.628 --> 05:35:10.638 align:start position:0%
what's the justification for the utility
 
05:35:13.510 --> 05:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
tax property exemption doesn't that run
 
05:35:15.310 --> 05:35:15.320 align:start position:0%
into the same
 
05:35:17.910 --> 05:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
nonuniformity problem that that the the
 
05:35:21.350 --> 05:35:21.360 align:start position:0%
Rand lawsuit was about not really not
 
05:35:23.670 --> 05:35:23.680 align:start position:0%
really to answer that last question
 
05:35:26.350 --> 05:35:26.360 align:start position:0%
utilities are are different they're a
 
05:35:29.670 --> 05:35:29.680 align:start position:0%
unique form of property so I think uh
 
05:35:31.830 --> 05:35:31.840 align:start position:0%
the the court of had to look at that
 
05:35:34.990 --> 05:35:35.000 align:start position:0%
question would uh say uh they can be
 
05:35:38.430 --> 05:35:38.440 align:start position:0%
treated differently um and then and um
 
05:35:40.230 --> 05:35:40.240 align:start position:0%
they are treated differently they pay
 
05:35:45.230 --> 05:35:45.240 align:start position:0%
much higher tax it's $6.6 $6.60 per
 
05:35:48.670 --> 05:35:48.680 align:start position:0%
thousand um it's what the swept rate was
 
05:35:49.948 --> 05:35:49.958 align:start position:0%
back in
 
05:35:52.670 --> 05:35:52.680 align:start position:0%
2001 and it stayed at
 
05:35:56.990 --> 05:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
$6.60 per thousand for
 
05:36:03.110 --> 05:36:03.120 align:start position:0%
utilities um and uh um gets remitted to
 
05:36:04.910 --> 05:36:04.920 align:start position:0%
the state it never gets into the hands
 
05:36:07.030 --> 05:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
of the municipalities it hasn't been
 
05:36:10.110 --> 05:36:10.120 align:start position:0%
part of this excess swept to Pate
 
05:36:13.190 --> 05:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
because uh the utilities don't have to
 
05:36:16.910 --> 05:36:16.920 align:start position:0%
pay the swep tax they are exempt from
 
05:36:21.110 --> 05:36:21.120 align:start position:0%
it follow yes go ahead thank you so it's
 
05:36:24.548 --> 05:36:24.558 align:start position:0%
different question um sometimes people
 
05:36:28.190 --> 05:36:28.200 align:start position:0%
don't pay their property tax and so the
 
05:36:30.310 --> 05:36:30.320 align:start position:0%
the town might not necessarily collect
 
05:36:32.670 --> 05:36:32.680 align:start position:0%
the full amount they're supposed to does
 
05:36:32.680 --> 05:36:33.548 align:start position:0%
the full amount they're supposed to does
the

05:36:33.548 --> 05:36:33.558 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:36:36.150 --> 05:36:36.160 align:start position:0%
bill make it so they still have to send
 
05:36:38.948 --> 05:36:38.958 align:start position:0%
in the full amount and then collect or
 
05:36:41.750 --> 05:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
or do they drip and drab stuff back to
 
05:36:44.390 --> 05:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
the question I don't know that
 
05:36:48.750 --> 05:36:48.760 align:start position:0%
for I think I would want Dr to tell us
 
05:36:52.868 --> 05:36:52.878 align:start position:0%
exactly what happens there um I I don't
 
05:36:54.830 --> 05:36:54.840 align:start position:0%
know maybe representative Luna would
 
05:36:58.310 --> 05:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
would uh remember that but I I I'd be
 
05:37:00.030 --> 05:37:00.040 align:start position:0%
careful in answering that question it's
 
05:37:03.350 --> 05:37:03.360 align:start position:0%
a good question more rule making go
 
05:37:06.150 --> 05:37:06.160 align:start position:0%
ahead repr luno thank you very much Mr
 
05:37:08.310 --> 05:37:08.320 align:start position:0%
chair and and just to that that last
 
05:37:10.030 --> 05:37:10.040 align:start position:0%
point and representative Maguire's
 
05:37:12.150 --> 05:37:12.160 align:start position:0%
question I believe the commission study
 
05:37:15.628 --> 05:37:15.638 align:start position:0%
report um uh talks about that because um
 
05:37:18.430 --> 05:37:18.440 align:start position:0%
we did receive testimony that uh that
 
05:37:20.990 --> 05:37:21.000 align:start position:0%
property taxes are paid with a very very
 
05:37:24.070 --> 05:37:24.080 align:start position:0%
very high degree of reliability and um
 
05:37:25.910 --> 05:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
and so there's there's very little
 
05:37:29.430 --> 05:37:29.440 align:start position:0%
uncollected um on that um and as
 
05:37:31.750 --> 05:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
representative am said it's it's it's
 
05:37:36.510 --> 05:37:36.520 align:start position:0%
doled out in in four tranches to the Dr
 
05:37:38.708 --> 05:37:38.718 align:start position:0%
which should um should enable the the
 
05:37:41.470 --> 05:37:41.480 align:start position:0%
town to receive some municipality to
 
05:37:43.548 --> 05:37:43.558 align:start position:0%
receive some earnings on that um on that
 
05:37:45.830 --> 05:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
during the process but my qu my question
 
05:37:48.750 --> 05:37:48.760 align:start position:0%
actually is is is clarifying in nature
 
05:37:51.628 --> 05:37:51.638 align:start position:0%
going back to um representative lad's uh
 
05:37:54.990 --> 05:37:55.000 align:start position:0%
first question regarding the um the the
 
05:37:58.230 --> 05:37:58.240 align:start position:0%
changes to the low and moderate um um
 
05:38:01.990 --> 05:38:02.000 align:start position:0%
income homeowner uh property tax relief
 
05:38:05.708 --> 05:38:05.718 align:start position:0%
program which my understanding is a
 
05:38:08.070 --> 05:38:08.080 align:start position:0%
rebate that comes from the state
 
05:38:11.390 --> 05:38:11.400 align:start position:0%
which is unlike the veterans tax credit
 
05:38:14.430 --> 05:38:14.440 align:start position:0%
and other tax credit which are overlays
 
05:38:16.470 --> 05:38:16.480 align:start position:0%
onto the onto the other local property
 
05:38:18.868 --> 05:38:18.878 align:start position:0%
taxes this is something it's applied to
 
05:38:21.868 --> 05:38:21.878 align:start position:0%
the if I understand it right um correct
 
05:38:24.150 --> 05:38:24.160 align:start position:0%
me if I was wrong it it's a the
 
05:38:26.830 --> 05:38:26.840 align:start position:0%
homeowner would apply to the state and
 
05:38:29.708 --> 05:38:29.718 align:start position:0%
the state um appropriation for this
 
05:38:32.390 --> 05:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
which is contained in here would the
 
05:38:35.190 --> 05:38:35.200 align:start position:0%
that that rebate would come from State
 
05:38:38.230 --> 05:38:38.240 align:start position:0%
dollars that's correct that's correct
 
05:38:39.788 --> 05:38:39.798 align:start position:0%
represent spillsbury
 
05:38:43.230 --> 05:38:43.240 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman so I'm trying
 
05:38:46.510 --> 05:38:46.520 align:start position:0%
to recall the $30 million cap that's in
 
05:38:49.868 --> 05:38:49.878 align:start position:0%
this there is a cap in current law isn't
 
05:38:53.030 --> 05:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
there no no there is none so having a
 
05:38:55.548 --> 05:38:55.558 align:start position:0%
cap fundamentally I would think requires
 
05:38:58.430 --> 05:38:58.440 align:start position:0%
Dr to manage this process because it
 
05:39:00.190 --> 05:39:00.200 align:start position:0%
could be subject to
 
05:39:04.510 --> 05:39:04.520 align:start position:0%
pration well that's right and so um we
 
05:39:07.390 --> 05:39:07.400 align:start position:0%
have uh you know that part of it I have
 
05:39:09.510 --> 05:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
looked at uh closely but there were
 
05:39:13.070 --> 05:39:13.080 align:start position:0%
discussions with the ra and uh we have
 
05:39:15.830 --> 05:39:15.840 align:start position:0%
the uh issuance of the rebate they're
 
05:39:19.430 --> 05:39:19.440 align:start position:0%
paying out of the rebate at a late date
 
05:39:22.310 --> 05:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
so that uh and a deadline for the
 
05:39:25.390 --> 05:39:25.400 align:start position:0%
requests for rebates before that so that
 
05:39:29.708 --> 05:39:29.718 align:start position:0%
uh the uh total need will be known and
 
05:39:32.510 --> 05:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
then if there is a need for a an
 
05:39:35.510 --> 05:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
adjustment it can be uh made and then
 
05:39:38.310 --> 05:39:38.320 align:start position:0%
the payments will go out so I think it
 
05:39:40.150 --> 05:39:40.160 align:start position:0%
all fits
 
05:39:43.628 --> 05:39:43.638 align:start position:0%
together further questions and Paul
 
05:39:46.190 --> 05:39:46.200 align:start position:0%
second question
 
05:39:49.548 --> 05:39:49.558 align:start position:0%
um of course these all tie together to
 
05:39:51.628 --> 05:39:51.638 align:start position:0%
to swept but it's almost like there's
 
05:39:53.350 --> 05:39:53.360 align:start position:0%
two different bills here right one
 
05:39:56.150 --> 05:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
regarding the uh low and moderate income
 
05:39:59.510 --> 05:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
and the study committee um if for any
 
05:40:01.510 --> 05:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
reason uh
 
05:40:03.948 --> 05:40:03.958 align:start position:0%
those there wasn't a consensus to
 
05:40:06.270 --> 05:40:06.280 align:start position:0%
support that part of the bill I assume
 
05:40:07.628 --> 05:40:07.638 align:start position:0%
you would still consider the the first
 
05:40:09.910 --> 05:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
two parts uh sufficiently important in
 
05:40:12.070 --> 05:40:12.080 align:start position:0%
their own right to run oh I absolutely
 
05:40:12.080 --> 05:40:13.510 align:start position:0%
their own right to run oh I absolutely
would

05:40:13.510 --> 05:40:13.520 align:start position:0%
would
 
05:40:16.310 --> 05:40:16.320 align:start position:0%
um and I I think that gives me occasion
 
05:40:21.708 --> 05:40:21.718 align:start position:0%
to say that uh this bill in significant
 
05:40:25.750 --> 05:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
part is before you to fix what may prove
 
05:40:29.230 --> 05:40:29.240 align:start position:0%
to be a constitutional problem with the
 
05:40:29.240 --> 05:40:30.390 align:start position:0%
to be a constitutional problem with the
existing

05:40:30.390 --> 05:40:30.400 align:start position:0%
existing
 
05:40:34.750 --> 05:40:34.760 align:start position:0%
tax it is not a bill advocating for or
 
05:40:37.510 --> 05:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
against having a Statewide education
 
05:40:41.548 --> 05:40:41.558 align:start position:0%
property tax um but we have it right now
 
05:40:43.030 --> 05:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
and if we're going to have it and
 
05:40:45.350 --> 05:40:45.360 align:start position:0%
administer it we have to do so
 
05:40:48.830 --> 05:40:48.840 align:start position:0%
constitutionally and um it may be
 
05:40:51.270 --> 05:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
constitutional it may not be we'll find
 
05:40:54.210 --> 05:40:54.220 align:start position:0%
out and um and then we
 
05:40:54.220 --> 05:40:55.830 align:start position:0%
out and um and then we
[Music]

05:40:55.830 --> 05:40:55.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:40:58.868 --> 05:40:58.878 align:start position:0%
can if it's constitutional then we can
 
05:41:03.750 --> 05:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
approach it with uh our policy manal on
 
05:41:06.430 --> 05:41:06.440 align:start position:0%
and make some judgments about whether we
 
05:41:08.628 --> 05:41:08.638 align:start position:0%
think it's a good thing or not and if
 
05:41:13.110 --> 05:41:13.120 align:start position:0%
it's unconstitutional we can do this or
 
05:41:16.230 --> 05:41:16.240 align:start position:0%
we can uh also do away with it there's
 
05:41:19.670 --> 05:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
another option you know so I'm not here
 
05:41:22.150 --> 05:41:22.160 align:start position:0%
to Advocate one way or the other for it
 
05:41:25.070 --> 05:41:25.080 align:start position:0%
it is a major source of funds that's
 
05:41:26.788 --> 05:41:26.798 align:start position:0%
that goes into the school funding
 
05:41:30.110 --> 05:41:30.120 align:start position:0%
formula for Better or For Worse that's
 
05:41:31.788 --> 05:41:31.798 align:start position:0%
the way it is right
 
05:41:34.310 --> 05:41:34.320 align:start position:0%
now further questions from the committee
 
05:41:36.948 --> 05:41:36.958 align:start position:0%
representa luno thank you very much Mr
 
05:41:38.150 --> 05:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you very much for
 
05:41:39.750 --> 05:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
taking taking my question bringing this
 
05:41:42.868 --> 05:41:42.878 align:start position:0%
forward um could could you talk a little
 
05:41:46.310 --> 05:41:46.320 align:start position:0%
bit about who you would consider to be
 
05:41:50.910 --> 05:41:50.920 align:start position:0%
the the um likely candidates for the um
 
05:41:52.830 --> 05:41:52.840 align:start position:0%
the low and moderate income property tax
 
05:41:52.840 --> 05:41:56.390 align:start position:0%
the low and moderate income property tax
relief

05:41:56.390 --> 05:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:58.948 --> 05:41:58.958 align:start position:0%
program well there's so many out there
 
05:42:03.750 --> 05:42:03.760 align:start position:0%
that uh live in both wealthy and uh
 
05:42:06.230 --> 05:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
property poor poor towns you know it's
 
05:42:08.030 --> 05:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
it's a misleading to talk about wealthy
 
05:42:10.110 --> 05:42:10.120 align:start position:0%
towns and poor towns because it's much
 
05:42:12.468 --> 05:42:12.478 align:start position:0%
more complicated than that it's income
 
05:42:16.548 --> 05:42:16.558 align:start position:0%
levels that we you know have a very dim
 
05:42:18.990 --> 05:42:19.000 align:start position:0%
insight into because the information is
 
05:42:21.670 --> 05:42:21.680 align:start position:0%
so scant we've got very good information
 
05:42:24.190 --> 05:42:24.200 align:start position:0%
on property values but who lives in
 
05:42:26.110 --> 05:42:26.120 align:start position:0%
those properties we don't have really
 
05:42:30.390 --> 05:42:30.400 align:start position:0%
good information on that um but uh and
 
05:42:33.468 --> 05:42:33.478 align:start position:0%
without doubt in uh practically every
 
05:42:36.548 --> 05:42:36.558 align:start position:0%
Community even the high-end communities
 
05:42:38.788 --> 05:42:38.798 align:start position:0%
that have very high levels of property
 
05:42:42.230 --> 05:42:42.240 align:start position:0%
tax per capita or per student or
 
05:42:47.788 --> 05:42:47.798 align:start position:0%
whatever your per measure is um have uh
 
05:42:50.830 --> 05:42:50.840 align:start position:0%
uh some manufactured housing or trailer
 
05:42:54.270 --> 05:42:54.280 align:start position:0%
homes um and uh right there uh it's
 
05:42:58.590 --> 05:42:58.600 align:start position:0%
going to be fairly low um cost and uh
 
05:43:00.628 --> 05:43:00.638 align:start position:0%
there are going to be people living in
 
05:43:03.910 --> 05:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
these uh houses and some will maybe have
 
05:43:05.628 --> 05:43:05.638 align:start position:0%
lived there all their life and it's now
 
05:43:07.430 --> 05:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
a very valuable piece of property prop
 
05:43:08.868 --> 05:43:08.878 align:start position:0%
but it wasn't when they started Living
 
05:43:12.070 --> 05:43:12.080 align:start position:0%
in there um and uh it is people like
 
05:43:15.350 --> 05:43:15.360 align:start position:0%
that who will be uh able to benefit from
 
05:43:18.628 --> 05:43:18.638 align:start position:0%
this there are in in other towns that
 
05:43:23.110 --> 05:43:23.120 align:start position:0%
are Rural and uh and um where the
 
05:43:26.548 --> 05:43:26.558 align:start position:0%
property values are low um who also will
 
05:43:28.868 --> 05:43:28.878 align:start position:0%
be eligible and the people living in
 
05:43:31.510 --> 05:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
those properties will have income within
 
05:43:34.390 --> 05:43:34.400 align:start position:0%
the limits here uh it is trying to
 
05:43:37.750 --> 05:43:37.760 align:start position:0%
Target a relatively lowincome community
 
05:43:43.788 --> 05:43:43.798 align:start position:0%
for sure and trying to uh limit um the
 
05:43:46.948 --> 05:43:46.958 align:start position:0%
amount that can be remitted to something
 
05:43:48.830 --> 05:43:48.840 align:start position:0%
that's reasonable and manageable for the
 
05:43:52.230 --> 05:43:52.240 align:start position:0%
state and uh so it's it does I didn't
 
05:43:54.110 --> 05:43:54.120 align:start position:0%
mention it but it's it's mentioned in my
 
05:43:59.750 --> 05:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
summary uh have a $1,100 per taxpayer
 
05:44:03.910 --> 05:44:03.920 align:start position:0%
ceiling uh you can't get more than that
 
05:44:06.830 --> 05:44:06.840 align:start position:0%
even if the calculation brought you to a
 
05:44:09.910 --> 05:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
high level you get cut off at
 
05:44:12.708 --> 05:44:12.718 align:start position:0%
$1,100 so
 
05:44:15.070 --> 05:44:15.080 align:start position:0%
that's quick fall how does that compare
 
05:44:18.430 --> 05:44:18.440 align:start position:0%
to the current um uh the current program
 
05:44:19.948 --> 05:44:19.958 align:start position:0%
the main thing is the amount of money
 
05:44:23.910 --> 05:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
that's uh available is uh this applies
 
05:44:27.350 --> 05:44:27.360 align:start position:0%
to the school tax as well as the uh the
 
05:44:30.548 --> 05:44:30.558 align:start position:0%
swept and the swept in my community is
 
05:44:34.070 --> 05:44:34.080 align:start position:0%
about eight eight time times less than
 
05:44:37.430 --> 05:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
uh than the school tax school scho tax
 
05:44:38.628 --> 05:44:38.638 align:start position:0%
is a
 
05:44:42.750 --> 05:44:42.760 align:start position:0%
big big element in this this
 
05:44:44.750 --> 05:44:44.760 align:start position:0%
calculation thank you thank you very
 
05:44:46.350 --> 05:44:46.360 align:start position:0%
much are there further questions from
 
05:44:49.590 --> 05:44:49.600 align:start position:0%
the committee yes represent Amon thank
 
05:44:52.230 --> 05:44:52.240 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you for Tak my
 
05:44:54.390 --> 05:44:54.400 align:start position:0%
question I'm this might be obvious but
 
05:44:58.468 --> 05:44:58.478 align:start position:0%
I'm not clear so is it the in the U tax
 
05:45:03.830 --> 05:45:03.840 align:start position:0%
relief 1,00 per claimant is per
 
05:45:06.230 --> 05:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
residence or if there's a husband and
 
05:45:08.230 --> 05:45:08.240 align:start position:0%
wife do they each qualify for 1100 or
 
05:45:09.670 --> 05:45:09.680 align:start position:0%
potentially qualify no it's the
 
05:45:11.150 --> 05:45:11.160 align:start position:0%
household the household I think it's the
 
05:45:13.190 --> 05:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
household than
 
05:45:16.788 --> 05:45:16.798 align:start position:0%
yeah further questions from the
 
05:45:19.628 --> 05:45:19.638 align:start position:0%
committee yes representative fellows yes
 
05:45:25.230 --> 05:45:25.240 align:start position:0%
thank you so um right now the maximum
 
05:45:28.390 --> 05:45:28.400 align:start position:0%
amount of the home value that you can
 
05:45:34.230 --> 05:45:34.240 align:start position:0%
apply for is capped at um 2ou
 
05:45:38.948 --> 05:45:38.958 align:start position:0%
220,000 and I know from before it was
 
05:45:42.230 --> 05:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
set at that figure about four years ago
 
05:45:45.750 --> 05:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
it had been 100,000 for a long time I'm
 
05:45:50.270 --> 05:45:50.280 align:start position:0%
wondering why you made the portion of
 
05:45:55.070 --> 05:45:55.080 align:start position:0%
the home value that can qualify for this
 
05:45:58.910 --> 05:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
tax lower instead of making it higher
 
05:46:00.548 --> 05:46:00.558 align:start position:0%
because property values are you know
 
05:46:05.030 --> 05:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
going up and up and up I think it was uh
 
05:46:07.730 --> 05:46:07.740 align:start position:0%
a function of uh
 
05:46:07.740 --> 05:46:09.150 align:start position:0%
a function of uh
[Music]

05:46:09.150 --> 05:46:09.160 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:46:13.070 --> 05:46:13.080 align:start position:0%
the uh inclusion of the school tax into
 
05:46:16.350 --> 05:46:16.360 align:start position:0%
the calculation now we're talking about
 
05:46:19.750 --> 05:46:19.760 align:start position:0%
you see a much higher rate on
 
05:46:24.510 --> 05:46:24.520 align:start position:0%
the value of property that's okay
 
05:46:24.520 --> 05:46:26.030 align:start position:0%
the value of property that's okay
further

05:46:26.030 --> 05:46:26.040 align:start position:0%
further
 
05:46:28.628 --> 05:46:28.638 align:start position:0%
questions not seeing thank you very much
 
05:46:28.638 --> 05:46:29.430 align:start position:0%
questions not seeing thank you very much
thank

05:46:29.430 --> 05:46:29.440 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:46:33.788 --> 05:46:33.798 align:start position:0%
you all right uh I just uh just sure I
 
05:46:37.190 --> 05:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
note I I think this I I assume that this
 
05:46:40.868 --> 05:46:40.878 align:start position:0%
Bill along with the other swep bills um
 
05:46:43.590 --> 05:46:43.600 align:start position:0%
will be part of our deliberations later
 
05:46:45.948 --> 05:46:45.958 align:start position:0%
on as we think about school funding well
 
05:46:48.548 --> 05:46:48.558 align:start position:0%
I I'm sure I'm sure uh when we're
 
05:46:50.150 --> 05:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
talking about all this money we're going
 
05:46:52.868 --> 05:46:52.878 align:start position:0%
to be definitely talking about swep but
 
05:46:55.070 --> 05:46:55.080 align:start position:0%
work session in work session yeah oh
 
05:46:57.430 --> 05:46:57.440 align:start position:0%
yeah well the the work session it uh
 
05:46:59.230 --> 05:46:59.240 align:start position:0%
tomorrow it's just special education oh
 
05:47:01.310 --> 05:47:01.320 align:start position:0%
I know that so we're not going there but
 
05:47:04.270 --> 05:47:04.280 align:start position:0%
that's what we're trying to get towards
 
05:47:06.910 --> 05:47:06.920 align:start position:0%
in that second week of February now
 
05:47:08.868 --> 05:47:08.878 align:start position:0%
after we get by this then's work session
 
05:47:11.070 --> 05:47:11.080 align:start position:0%
for the rest of that month till March
 
05:47:13.590 --> 05:47:13.600 align:start position:0%
6th when this bill has to be out of here
 
05:47:15.548 --> 05:47:15.558 align:start position:0%
sounds good I I just have one more
 
05:47:17.708 --> 05:47:17.718 align:start position:0%
question I don't have any fiscal note
 
05:47:22.270 --> 05:47:22.280 align:start position:0%
did is there one yeah yes there is one
 
05:47:25.150 --> 05:47:25.160 align:start position:0%
uh that got handed out it's in a pile of
 
05:47:31.350 --> 05:47:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:33.468 --> 05:47:33.478 align:start position:0%
somewhere oh it's on the desk right in
 
05:47:35.510 --> 05:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
front of us here
 
05:47:38.468 --> 05:47:38.478 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah
 
05:47:41.150 --> 05:47:41.160 align:start position:0%

05:47:53.590 --> 05:47:53.600 align:start position:0%
Shen are there any other pink cards on
 
05:47:55.708 --> 05:47:55.718 align:start position:0%
this bill I just have that one here in
 
05:47:59.310 --> 05:47:59.320 align:start position:0%
the bucket okay good afternoon again uh
 
05:48:01.548 --> 05:48:01.558 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Zach Shen I'm
 
05:48:02.788 --> 05:48:02.798 align:start position:0%
here representing the New Hampshire
 
05:48:05.190 --> 05:48:05.200 align:start position:0%
school funding fairness project um I
 
05:48:06.830 --> 05:48:06.840 align:start position:0%
will try not to reiterate anything that
 
05:48:07.948 --> 05:48:07.958 align:start position:0%
was just said during the opening of the
 
05:48:09.948 --> 05:48:09.958 align:start position:0%
bill but just wanted to highlight uh a
 
05:48:13.990 --> 05:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
few points um uh first off which was uh
 
05:48:15.510 --> 05:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
you know the last time that this bill
 
05:48:16.788 --> 05:48:16.798 align:start position:0%
was introduced that representative Ames
 
05:48:18.990 --> 05:48:19.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned was actually exactly two years
 
05:48:21.948 --> 05:48:21.958 align:start position:0%
ago tomorrow um House Bill 569 that did
 
05:48:24.510 --> 05:48:24.520 align:start position:0%
a very similar approach to expanding the
 
05:48:26.510 --> 05:48:26.520 align:start position:0%
currently existing low and moderate
 
05:48:28.150 --> 05:48:28.160 align:start position:0%
property tax relief program so this is a
 
05:48:30.150 --> 05:48:30.160 align:start position:0%
program that currently exists in law the
 
05:48:31.948 --> 05:48:31.958 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue Administration
 
05:48:33.990 --> 05:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
currently administers it structure is
 
05:48:36.510 --> 05:48:36.520 align:start position:0%
already there the bill we're talking
 
05:48:38.230 --> 05:48:38.240 align:start position:0%
about and the previous versions are just
 
05:48:40.750 --> 05:48:40.760 align:start position:0%
looking at making the claims and the
 
05:48:44.310 --> 05:48:44.320 align:start position:0%
limits more realistic uh in today's
 
05:48:48.190 --> 05:48:48.200 align:start position:0%
income and housing markets um since the
 
05:48:50.868 --> 05:48:50.878 align:start position:0%
program was established in 2001 the
 
05:48:53.590 --> 05:48:53.600 align:start position:0%
number of claims granted dropped from
 
05:48:55.628 --> 05:48:55.638 align:start position:0%
27,000 uh in the first year where they
 
05:48:58.788 --> 05:48:58.798 align:start position:0%
were granting claims um to under about
 
05:49:01.310 --> 05:49:01.320 align:start position:0%
right about 5,500 and that's largely due
 
05:49:04.310 --> 05:49:04.320 align:start position:0%
to stagnant until about three years ago
 
05:49:06.270 --> 05:49:06.280 align:start position:0%
a bill representative fellows filed
 
05:49:08.270 --> 05:49:08.280 align:start position:0%
increase the limits a little bit but
 
05:49:10.948 --> 05:49:10.958 align:start position:0%
until that point in 2021 the limits had
 
05:49:13.110 --> 05:49:13.120 align:start position:0%
stayed exactly the same for just about
 
05:49:14.910 --> 05:49:14.920 align:start position:0%
20 years which definitely means the
 
05:49:16.670 --> 05:49:16.680 align:start position:0%
number of claims of people eligible were
 
05:49:18.670 --> 05:49:18.680 align:start position:0%
shrinking over time as costs were
 
05:49:22.070 --> 05:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
increasing as housing uh prices were
 
05:49:24.750 --> 05:49:24.760 align:start position:0%
increasing um I think the uh really
 
05:49:26.708 --> 05:49:26.718 align:start position:0%
critical part of this as we talk about
 
05:49:28.270 --> 05:49:28.280 align:start position:0%
the kind of conversations and you heard
 
05:49:30.430 --> 05:49:30.440 align:start position:0%
some of it earlier um relative to
 
05:49:32.468 --> 05:49:32.478 align:start position:0%
previous Bill about swept remitting
 
05:49:34.788 --> 05:49:34.798 align:start position:0%
excess swept whether or not to go down
 
05:49:36.788 --> 05:49:36.798 align:start position:0%
that road the history of that one of
 
05:49:39.468 --> 05:49:39.478 align:start position:0%
large arguments made um from opponents
 
05:49:41.190 --> 05:49:41.200 align:start position:0%
of changing swept back to a true
 
05:49:43.310 --> 05:49:43.320 align:start position:0%
Statewide tax is that there are people
 
05:49:46.070 --> 05:49:46.080 align:start position:0%
who live in towns where the community
 
05:49:47.750 --> 05:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
itself might have high property value
 
05:49:49.548 --> 05:49:49.558 align:start position:0%
and average doesn't necessarily mean
 
05:49:50.910 --> 05:49:50.920 align:start position:0%
that everyone in that Community is
 
05:49:53.868 --> 05:49:53.878 align:start position:0%
wealthy that's true what I think is
 
05:49:55.830 --> 05:49:55.840 align:start position:0%
really um good about this bill is it
 
05:49:58.150 --> 05:49:58.160 align:start position:0%
does two pieces right it changes swept
 
05:49:59.948 --> 05:49:59.958 align:start position:0%
back into a true Statewide tax which we
 
05:50:02.270 --> 05:50:02.280 align:start position:0%
think is in line with the Constitution
 
05:50:04.270 --> 05:50:04.280 align:start position:0%
and the intent of the original swept as
 
05:50:06.230 --> 05:50:06.240 align:start position:0%
it was written and enacted but it takes
 
05:50:08.030 --> 05:50:08.040 align:start position:0%
into account the fact that there are
 
05:50:10.230 --> 05:50:10.240 align:start position:0%
people living in communities that might
 
05:50:12.750 --> 05:50:12.760 align:start position:0%
see if they had to remit excess swept
 
05:50:14.150 --> 05:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
and then wanted to keep the same level
 
05:50:15.830 --> 05:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
of funding in their communities for
 
05:50:17.468 --> 05:50:17.478 align:start position:0%
their schools they would need to raise
 
05:50:19.510 --> 05:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
their tax rates this takes that into
 
05:50:21.750 --> 05:50:21.760 align:start position:0%
account by dramatically expanding this
 
05:50:23.670 --> 05:50:23.680 align:start position:0%
existing low and moderate property tax
 
05:50:25.628 --> 05:50:25.638 align:start position:0%
relief program for those folks that
 
05:50:27.230 --> 05:50:27.240 align:start position:0%
might be on the edge there that maybe
 
05:50:28.830 --> 05:50:28.840 align:start position:0%
have say have been living in Portsmith
 
05:50:31.190 --> 05:50:31.200 align:start position:0%
for 30 years and are right on the edge
 
05:50:33.030 --> 05:50:33.040 align:start position:0%
and so I think this is really kind of a
 
05:50:35.548 --> 05:50:35.558 align:start position:0%
walking this fine line along the swep
 
05:50:38.070 --> 05:50:38.080 align:start position:0%
debate um and taking into account that
 
05:50:40.468 --> 05:50:40.478 align:start position:0%
people pay taxes towns don't pay taxes
 
05:50:42.628 --> 05:50:42.638 align:start position:0%
right these are individuals paying swept
 
05:50:44.390 --> 05:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
in their individual communities and how
 
05:50:46.910 --> 05:50:46.920 align:start position:0%
can we target specific relief through
 
05:50:49.110 --> 05:50:49.120 align:start position:0%
again an existing program that we
 
05:50:51.548 --> 05:50:51.558 align:start position:0%
chronically underfund how can we expand
 
05:50:53.590 --> 05:50:53.600 align:start position:0%
the amount expand the claims everything
 
05:50:55.430 --> 05:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
that was kind of introduced uh in the
 
05:50:57.548 --> 05:50:57.558 align:start position:0%
opening of the bill um a few more
 
05:50:59.468 --> 05:50:59.478 align:start position:0%
numbers just kind of put in context how
 
05:51:01.310 --> 05:51:01.320 align:start position:0%
underutilized and underfunded this
 
05:51:03.430 --> 05:51:03.440 align:start position:0%
program is right now uh the average
 
05:51:08.310 --> 05:51:08.320 align:start position:0%
relief um per applicant in 201 21 was
 
05:51:10.830 --> 05:51:10.840 align:start position:0%
$240 which when the average property tax
 
05:51:13.270 --> 05:51:13.280 align:start position:0%
bill was over $7,000 is not really
 
05:51:16.548 --> 05:51:16.558 align:start position:0%
meaningful relief uh it actually dropped
 
05:51:20.190 --> 05:51:20.200 align:start position:0%
uh to $150 in 2022 we're back up to
 
05:51:23.548 --> 05:51:23.558 align:start position:0%
about 200 bucks $200 and one
 
05:51:26.750 --> 05:51:26.760 align:start position:0%
$21.66 uh in 2023 so we have this
 
05:51:29.430 --> 05:51:29.440 align:start position:0%
program is providing very little leaf
 
05:51:31.468 --> 05:51:31.478 align:start position:0%
relative to the actual cost of property
 
05:51:33.788 --> 05:51:33.798 align:start position:0%
taxes in the state and I think that this
 
05:51:35.430 --> 05:51:35.440 align:start position:0%
bill I know there's a number of
 
05:51:37.270 --> 05:51:37.280 align:start position:0%
adjustments that could be made um some
 
05:51:38.510 --> 05:51:38.520 align:start position:0%
of them were brought up in the questions
 
05:51:40.310 --> 05:51:40.320 align:start position:0%
earlier but it really represents an
 
05:51:43.070 --> 05:51:43.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity to actually address property
 
05:51:44.750 --> 05:51:44.760 align:start position:0%
taxes which I know everyone here has
 
05:51:46.830 --> 05:51:46.840 align:start position:0%
heard a lot about um in a program we
 
05:51:48.990 --> 05:51:49.000 align:start position:0%
already have set up while also moving in
 
05:51:50.868 --> 05:51:50.878 align:start position:0%
a direction that we believe is in line
 
05:51:52.910 --> 05:51:52.920 align:start position:0%
with the original intent of swept as a
 
05:51:55.670 --> 05:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
true Statewide tax it's a state tax to
 
05:51:57.628 --> 05:51:57.638 align:start position:0%
pay for a state obligation to fund
 
05:52:00.390 --> 05:52:00.400 align:start position:0%
education um and is likely in line with
 
05:52:03.510 --> 05:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
uh you know hopefully recent or recent
 
05:52:04.868 --> 05:52:04.878 align:start position:0%
court rulings and we'll see what the
 
05:52:07.310 --> 05:52:07.320 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court says as well
 
05:52:08.948 --> 05:52:08.958 align:start position:0%
I'll stop there and I'm happy to answer
 
05:52:11.230 --> 05:52:11.240 align:start position:0%
any questions um I just one last thing
 
05:52:12.990 --> 05:52:13.000 align:start position:0%
would would flag that the fiscal policy
 
05:52:15.110 --> 05:52:15.120 align:start position:0%
Institute has done a lot of really good
 
05:52:16.990 --> 05:52:17.000 align:start position:0%
studies on this program over the years
 
05:52:18.230 --> 05:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
so if you're looking for some historical
 
05:52:19.948 --> 05:52:19.958 align:start position:0%
data they've done a good job tracking
 
05:52:21.510 --> 05:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
those claims and
 
05:52:23.788 --> 05:52:23.798 align:start position:0%
Trends thank you very much are there any
 
05:52:26.150 --> 05:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
05:52:29.030 --> 05:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing any thank you very
 
05:52:31.830 --> 05:52:31.840 align:start position:0%
much are there any more pink cards out
 
05:52:35.670 --> 05:52:35.680 align:start position:0%
there we have not got up here thank you
 
05:52:37.548 --> 05:52:37.558 align:start position:0%
very much we're going toose close this
 
05:52:41.190 --> 05:52:41.200 align:start position:0%
hearing and we're going to go
 
05:52:45.990 --> 05:52:46.000 align:start position:0%
into look at the time here
 
05:52:48.430 --> 05:52:48.440 align:start position:0%
330 we got a few minutes we got to play
 
05:52:51.510 --> 05:52:51.520 align:start position:0%
with here seven or eight
 
05:52:54.750 --> 05:52:54.760 align:start position:0%
minutes by this time
 
05:53:00.590 --> 05:53:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:12.070 --> 05:53:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:14.350 --> 05:53:14.360 align:start position:0%
are we going to recess for a few minutes
 
05:53:15.948 --> 05:53:15.958 align:start position:0%
I I have no idea what we're doing right
 
05:53:17.788 --> 05:53:17.798 align:start position:0%
now yeah we're we're we're breaking
 
05:53:20.350 --> 05:53:20.360 align:start position:0%
right now for about 8 10 n minutes or so
 
05:53:22.230 --> 05:53:22.240 align:start position:0%
thereabouts thank you Mr we'll start up
 
05:53:25.110 --> 05:53:25.120 align:start position:0%
at 3:30 by that
 
05:53:27.830 --> 05:53:27.840 align:start position:0%
clock not human stand up in the middle
 
05:53:30.628 --> 05:53:30.638 align:start position:0%
of yeah that
 
05:53:34.110 --> 05:53:34.120 align:start position:0%
is so probably about well whenever it's
 
05:53:37.030 --> 05:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
3:30 it's 3:30 somewhere right right
 
05:53:39.750 --> 05:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
it's a good problem to have though
 
05:54:35.310 --> 05:54:35.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:35.320 --> 05:55:05.310 align:start position:0%

06:01:23.150 --> 06:01:23.160 align:start position:0%
we're ready to go ahead here with the
 
06:01:26.628 --> 06:01:26.638 align:start position:0%
next and last bill for today it's
 
06:01:28.868 --> 06:01:28.878 align:start position:0%
3:30 HB
 
06:01:31.788 --> 06:01:31.798 align:start position:0%
137 this is relative to allocating
 
06:01:34.270 --> 06:01:34.280 align:start position:0%
excess we Statewide education property
 
06:01:37.190 --> 06:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
tax funds for local school and Municipal
 
06:01:40.548 --> 06:01:40.558 align:start position:0%
purposes and I'd like to recognize and
 
06:01:43.708 --> 06:01:43.718 align:start position:0%
welcome representative cordelli to our
 
06:01:47.788 --> 06:01:47.798 align:start position:0%
committee thank you uh uh for the record
 
06:01:50.670 --> 06:01:50.680 align:start position:0%
Glen cordelli uh representing uh tuen
 
06:01:53.310 --> 06:01:53.320 align:start position:0%
Boro wolfboro and oi in the beautiful
 
06:01:56.310 --> 06:01:56.320 align:start position:0%
Lakes Region and it's uh nice to visit
 
06:01:58.270 --> 06:01:58.280 align:start position:0%
with the other education
 
06:02:01.110 --> 06:02:01.120 align:start position:0%
committee um HB
 
06:02:05.070 --> 06:02:05.080 align:start position:0%
137 deals with current law it's not
 
06:02:08.468 --> 06:02:08.478 align:start position:0%
hypothetical or proposed uh change to
 
06:02:10.590 --> 06:02:10.600 align:start position:0%
the uh funding
 
06:02:15.070 --> 06:02:15.080 align:start position:0%
formula uh this deals with uh towns that
 
06:02:19.070 --> 06:02:19.080 align:start position:0%
collect more than is required uh by the
 
06:02:21.150 --> 06:02:21.160 align:start position:0%
state under the Statewide education
 
06:02:25.350 --> 06:02:25.360 align:start position:0%
property tax um and in I think it goes
 
06:02:30.990 --> 06:02:31.000 align:start position:0%
back to 2008 when that uh quote unquote
 
06:02:34.548 --> 06:02:34.558 align:start position:0%
excess money for the Statewide education
 
06:02:37.868 --> 06:02:37.878 align:start position:0%
property tax was sent from the towns
 
06:02:39.190 --> 06:02:39.200 align:start position:0%
back to the
 
06:02:41.670 --> 06:02:41.680 align:start position:0%
state in
 
06:02:44.110 --> 06:02:44.120 align:start position:0%
2011 there was a special committee on
 
06:02:46.430 --> 06:02:46.440 align:start position:0%
education funding and I believe chairman
 
06:02:51.150 --> 06:02:51.160 align:start position:0%
lad was part of that uh committee and um
 
06:02:53.910 --> 06:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
that had number of revisions to the
 
06:02:57.430 --> 06:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
Statewide education uh funding formula
 
06:02:59.468 --> 06:02:59.478 align:start position:0%
uh including differentiated Aid and
 
06:03:03.070 --> 06:03:03.080 align:start position:0%
fiscal disparity Aid it it also
 
06:03:06.468 --> 06:03:06.478 align:start position:0%
eliminated the requirement for
 
06:03:10.910 --> 06:03:10.920 align:start position:0%
these excess quote excess swept funds to
 
06:03:13.310 --> 06:03:13.320 align:start position:0%
be returned to the state but could be
 
06:03:16.990 --> 06:03:17.000 align:start position:0%
kept in the towns for educational
 
06:03:19.350 --> 06:03:19.360 align:start position:0%
purposes and actually in the original
 
06:03:21.830 --> 06:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
bill as introduced it
 
06:03:25.590 --> 06:03:25.600 align:start position:0%
specified uh they' be kept to offset
 
06:03:28.830 --> 06:03:28.840 align:start position:0%
School building projects or catastrophic
 
06:03:30.670 --> 06:03:30.680 align:start position:0%
special education
 
06:03:35.150 --> 06:03:35.160 align:start position:0%
costs uh that provision was uh uh that
 
06:03:37.430 --> 06:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
section was was amended out um by a
 
06:03:39.750 --> 06:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
later Amendment um in the
 
06:03:43.430 --> 06:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
house but the uh the bill passed and
 
06:03:45.110 --> 06:03:45.120 align:start position:0%
became law in
 
06:03:49.030 --> 06:03:49.040 align:start position:0%
2011 that allowed those uh quote unquote
 
06:03:52.788 --> 06:03:52.798 align:start position:0%
excess funds to be kept by The Local
 
06:03:57.390 --> 06:03:57.400 align:start position:0%
District uh there has been some rumors
 
06:04:01.230 --> 06:04:01.240 align:start position:0%
um and confusion about how those excess
 
06:04:05.310 --> 06:04:05.320 align:start position:0%
funds um are used um I've heard uh some
 
06:04:07.990 --> 06:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
people say that the town keeps some of
 
06:04:10.350 --> 06:04:10.360 align:start position:0%
the money to use for other than
 
06:04:10.360 --> 06:04:11.670 align:start position:0%
the money to use for other than
educational

06:04:11.670 --> 06:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
educational
 
06:04:16.270 --> 06:04:16.280 align:start position:0%
purposes um I think that the um there is
 
06:04:20.070 --> 06:04:20.080 align:start position:0%
a coalition of these towns that has uh
 
06:04:23.548 --> 06:04:23.558 align:start position:0%
testified in court uh papers that they
 
06:04:26.948 --> 06:04:26.958 align:start position:0%
know of no town that does not send that
 
06:04:29.990 --> 06:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
money to the schools for educational
 
06:04:33.150 --> 06:04:33.160 align:start position:0%
purposes um and I have not heard of any
 
06:04:36.670 --> 06:04:36.680 align:start position:0%
myself uh but I thought um it would be
 
06:04:39.390 --> 06:04:39.400 align:start position:0%
uh wise to put into
 
06:04:43.910 --> 06:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
law um and that's what s SP 137 does it
 
06:04:48.150 --> 06:04:48.160 align:start position:0%
adds a uh sentence at the end of
 
06:04:55.430 --> 06:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
76 uh colon 8 Roman 2 that those excess
 
06:04:58.590 --> 06:04:58.600 align:start position:0%
quote unquote funds the amount collected
 
06:05:01.910 --> 06:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
above what the state says is required by
 
06:05:05.468 --> 06:05:05.478 align:start position:0%
the town shall remain in the town for
 
06:05:08.750 --> 06:05:08.760 align:start position:0%
the use of the school or school
 
06:05:13.590 --> 06:05:13.600 align:start position:0%
districts um that is basically it um
 
06:05:15.910 --> 06:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
very simple um it goes back to the
 
06:05:15.920 --> 06:05:17.030 align:start position:0%
very simple um it goes back to the
original

06:05:17.030 --> 06:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
original
 
06:05:21.590 --> 06:05:21.600 align:start position:0%
intent um I believe and uh um hopefully
 
06:05:22.830 --> 06:05:22.840 align:start position:0%
this will
 
06:05:26.110 --> 06:05:26.120 align:start position:0%
clarify that original intent and how
 
06:05:29.670 --> 06:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
those funds are to be used to put any uh
 
06:05:33.070 --> 06:05:33.080 align:start position:0%
misconceptions uh to bed and that's my
 
06:05:35.788 --> 06:05:35.798 align:start position:0%
bill and I thank you very much thank
 
06:05:37.750 --> 06:05:37.760 align:start position:0%
very much are there any questions yes
 
06:05:40.628 --> 06:05:40.638 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire thank you Mr
 
06:05:42.590 --> 06:05:42.600 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you representative for
 
06:05:45.030 --> 06:05:45.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question um aren't there some
 
06:05:48.430 --> 06:05:48.440 align:start position:0%
locations and places that are so small
 
06:05:51.230 --> 06:05:51.240 align:start position:0%
they either have no students or the
 
06:05:52.990 --> 06:05:53.000 align:start position:0%
amount of money we're talking about here
 
06:05:55.310 --> 06:05:55.320 align:start position:0%
would be way in excess of what it would
 
06:05:57.830 --> 06:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
cost to educate the students that they
 
06:06:02.310 --> 06:06:02.320 align:start position:0%
have um I have a really uh well a
 
06:06:05.750 --> 06:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
relatively small town about 2,000 people
 
06:06:11.310 --> 06:06:11.320 align:start position:0%
and um um we do collect more than is
 
06:06:14.070 --> 06:06:14.080 align:start position:0%
required by the state even though it's a
 
06:06:16.708 --> 06:06:16.718 align:start position:0%
uniform tax as required in the
 
06:06:19.190 --> 06:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
Constitution it's a uniform Statewide
 
06:06:22.270 --> 06:06:22.280 align:start position:0%
education property tax rate um because
 
06:06:25.590 --> 06:06:25.600 align:start position:0%
of some some other people's properties
 
06:06:29.190 --> 06:06:29.200 align:start position:0%
uh down by the lake um we collect more
 
06:06:34.230 --> 06:06:34.240 align:start position:0%
than the state says we have to and um uh
 
06:06:39.230 --> 06:06:39.240 align:start position:0%
if we go back to a a formula such as in
 
06:06:42.750 --> 06:06:42.760 align:start position:0%
2008 would have a drastic impact on our
 
06:06:46.110 --> 06:06:46.120 align:start position:0%
community to return those quote unquote
 
06:06:49.310 --> 06:06:49.320 align:start position:0%
excess funds to the state but there are
 
06:06:52.030 --> 06:06:52.040 align:start position:0%
are towns also that actually have a
 
06:06:56.670 --> 06:06:56.680 align:start position:0%
negative rate um there are some um I
 
06:07:00.110 --> 06:07:00.120 align:start position:0%
think of one unincorporated place in our
 
06:07:02.788 --> 06:07:02.798 align:start position:0%
County that has a negative tax rate um
 
06:07:05.708 --> 06:07:05.718 align:start position:0%
because of that yes
 
06:07:08.150 --> 06:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
further questions so what would happen
 
06:07:11.788 --> 06:07:11.798 align:start position:0%
to that negative tax rate here because
 
06:07:14.270 --> 06:07:14.280 align:start position:0%
because currently as I understand it
 
06:07:16.830 --> 06:07:16.840 align:start position:0%
that money is returned to the to the
 
06:07:19.670 --> 06:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
property owner right or or just is not
 
06:07:22.350 --> 06:07:22.360 align:start position:0%
charged in the first place whereas here
 
06:07:25.230 --> 06:07:25.240 align:start position:0%
it has to go by your language it has to
 
06:07:27.910 --> 06:07:27.920 align:start position:0%
go only for for schools but maybe there
 
06:07:31.590 --> 06:07:31.600 align:start position:0%
is no spending on schools um the one
 
06:07:34.070 --> 06:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
unincorporated place that I I do know of
 
06:07:36.548 --> 06:07:36.558 align:start position:0%
in my County um they do have several
 
06:07:40.868 --> 06:07:40.878 align:start position:0%
students and tuition them out um to um
 
06:07:44.150 --> 06:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
either a local public school or to a
 
06:07:46.830 --> 06:07:46.840 align:start position:0%
private school for high school purposes
 
06:07:51.468 --> 06:07:51.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:54.868 --> 06:07:54.878 align:start position:0%
requirements further
 
06:07:58.110 --> 06:07:58.120 align:start position:0%
questions representative fellows yeah um
 
06:08:00.788 --> 06:08:00.798 align:start position:0%
thank you um representative cordelli are
 
06:08:04.548 --> 06:08:04.558 align:start position:0%
you familiar with um legislation that
 
06:08:07.548 --> 06:08:07.558 align:start position:0%
was passed believe it was in
 
06:08:11.030 --> 06:08:11.040 align:start position:0%
2004 that tried that did something like
 
06:08:14.548 --> 06:08:14.558 align:start position:0%
this the language in that though I to it
 
06:08:17.390 --> 06:08:17.400 align:start position:0%
was to address the
 
06:08:22.230 --> 06:08:22.240 align:start position:0%
um I don't if you're familiar with that
 
06:08:25.708 --> 06:08:25.718 align:start position:0%
question uh I I am not familiar with the
 
06:08:27.910 --> 06:08:27.920 align:start position:0%
2004 legislation yeah to tell you the
 
06:08:30.628 --> 06:08:30.638 align:start position:0%
truth so one of the things that's like
 
06:08:34.390 --> 06:08:34.400 align:start position:0%
that that that you may be interested in
 
06:08:36.948 --> 06:08:36.958 align:start position:0%
is that it's said instead of used for
 
06:08:39.310 --> 06:08:39.320 align:start position:0%
school districts it said used for
 
06:08:43.350 --> 06:08:43.360 align:start position:0%
Education which could be more broadly
 
06:08:50.628 --> 06:08:50.638 align:start position:0%
interpreted um yes yeah um um if if I um
 
06:08:53.750 --> 06:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
were to um rewrite some of the language
 
06:08:56.548 --> 06:08:56.558 align:start position:0%
I might use something like that or even
 
06:09:02.230 --> 06:09:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:04.910 --> 06:09:04.920 align:start position:0%
needs I I I want to follow that because
 
06:09:07.868 --> 06:09:07.878 align:start position:0%
I'm that topic um I'm going to ask you a
 
06:09:10.430 --> 06:09:10.440 align:start position:0%
question about it was HB
 
06:09:13.190 --> 06:09:13.200 align:start position:0%
337 back in
 
06:09:16.510 --> 06:09:16.520 align:start position:0%
2011 sponsored by representa hes
 
06:09:21.110 --> 06:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
Flanigan lad Kirk Benton court and
 
06:09:24.350 --> 06:09:24.360 align:start position:0%
Jasper and that particular bill would
 
06:09:27.190 --> 06:09:27.200 align:start position:0%
you be supportive of what that Bill said
 
06:09:29.788 --> 06:09:29.798 align:start position:0%
were the monies that were the what we're
 
06:09:33.430 --> 06:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
talking about is this ex excess one of
 
06:09:36.990 --> 06:09:37.000 align:start position:0%
the options within that was to put that
 
06:09:39.910 --> 06:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
into a fund in
 
06:09:43.788 --> 06:09:43.798 align:start position:0%
which it was directed towards building
 
06:09:46.670 --> 06:09:46.680 align:start position:0%
building construction renovation or at
 
06:09:49.390 --> 06:09:49.400 align:start position:0%
that time catastrophic Aid and it would
 
06:09:52.510 --> 06:09:52.520 align:start position:0%
offset uh applications later on there
 
06:09:54.468 --> 06:09:54.478 align:start position:0%
are other options of course within that
 
06:09:57.590 --> 06:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
bill which we had and also spoke to the
 
06:09:59.548 --> 06:09:59.558 align:start position:0%
interest gained from that the interest
 
06:10:01.468 --> 06:10:01.478 align:start position:0%
to go back to the
 
06:10:05.030 --> 06:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
municipality uh I I would be interested
 
06:10:06.910 --> 06:10:06.920 align:start position:0%
in language like that I would like to
 
06:10:10.830 --> 06:10:10.840 align:start position:0%
see um instructional purposes um added
 
06:10:16.070 --> 06:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
to that um you know with um test scores
 
06:10:19.270 --> 06:10:19.280 align:start position:0%
and um you know the need to improve our
 
06:10:22.468 --> 06:10:22.478 align:start position:0%
proficiency rates um I think that uh
 
06:10:25.230 --> 06:10:25.240 align:start position:0%
instructional needs um would be a very
 
06:10:27.948 --> 06:10:27.958 align:start position:0%
valid and important um use of any of
 
06:10:30.468 --> 06:10:30.478 align:start position:0%
those funds as well thank you further
 
06:10:32.548 --> 06:10:32.558 align:start position:0%
questions represent luno you had your
 
06:10:37.070 --> 06:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
hand up what was the
 
06:10:41.190 --> 06:10:41.200 align:start position:0%
HB 337 FN
 
06:10:44.030 --> 06:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
local I've got it right here so thank
 
06:10:46.990 --> 06:10:47.000 align:start position:0%
you and and that was from 2011 that was
 
06:10:51.030 --> 06:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
201 it was hijacked changed resulting in
 
06:10:54.910 --> 06:10:54.920 align:start position:0%
a stabilization etc etc etc right so so
 
06:10:56.750 --> 06:10:56.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh Mr chair and this
 
06:10:59.150 --> 06:10:59.160 align:start position:0%
is a question back back very similar to
 
06:11:01.510 --> 06:11:01.520 align:start position:0%
the last question that you got but but
 
06:11:04.390 --> 06:11:04.400 align:start position:0%
in terms of um in terms of your
 
06:11:04.400 --> 06:11:06.030 align:start position:0%
in terms of um in terms of your
community

06:11:06.030 --> 06:11:06.040 align:start position:0%
community
 
06:11:08.150 --> 06:11:08.160 align:start position:0%
Tuftonboro being able to use this
 
06:11:11.910 --> 06:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
supplemental Grant to to improve um
 
06:11:14.270 --> 06:11:14.280 align:start position:0%
student test scores and things like that
 
06:11:16.670 --> 06:11:16.680 align:start position:0%
um should should Newport also get a
 
06:11:18.390 --> 06:11:18.400 align:start position:0%
supplemental Grant from the state
 
06:11:20.230 --> 06:11:20.240 align:start position:0%
because my understanding is is their
 
06:11:21.628 --> 06:11:21.638 align:start position:0%
student outcomes there some of the
 
06:11:24.070 --> 06:11:24.080 align:start position:0%
lowest in the state should they also get
 
06:11:26.750 --> 06:11:26.760 align:start position:0%
supplemental grants from the state to uh
 
06:11:28.910 --> 06:11:28.920 align:start position:0%
to help improve their test scores
 
06:11:33.110 --> 06:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
too um I I think that uh Newport and
 
06:11:36.390 --> 06:11:36.400 align:start position:0%
other communities um do get uh
 
06:11:38.510 --> 06:11:38.520 align:start position:0%
additional funds through fiscal
 
06:11:40.990 --> 06:11:41.000 align:start position:0%
disparity Aid and extraordinary needs
 
06:11:44.230 --> 06:11:44.240 align:start position:0%
grants and other mechanisms other than
 
06:11:46.590 --> 06:11:46.600 align:start position:0%
um collecting more than is required by
 
06:11:48.990 --> 06:11:49.000 align:start position:0%
the state uh for the Statewide education
 
06:11:51.670 --> 06:11:51.680 align:start position:0%
property tax okay so follow up on that
 
06:11:53.070 --> 06:11:53.080 align:start position:0%
so when I'm talking about it
 
06:11:55.788 --> 06:11:55.798 align:start position:0%
specifically it's through adequacy and
 
06:11:58.030 --> 06:11:58.040 align:start position:0%
the Statewide education property tax is
 
06:12:03.548 --> 06:12:03.558 align:start position:0%
a component of of adequacy so so so once
 
06:12:05.910 --> 06:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
adequacy has been
 
06:12:10.590 --> 06:12:10.600 align:start position:0%
um met through um through Statewide
 
06:12:12.788 --> 06:12:12.798 align:start position:0%
education property tax and and a
 
06:12:16.430 --> 06:12:16.440 align:start position:0%
community gets a supplemental um uh
 
06:12:19.310 --> 06:12:19.320 align:start position:0%
grant that could be used for improving
 
06:12:22.670 --> 06:12:22.680 align:start position:0%
test scores should other districts get
 
06:12:25.390 --> 06:12:25.400 align:start position:0%
um supplemental grants as part of
 
06:12:28.070 --> 06:12:28.080 align:start position:0%
adequate education Aid to do the same
 
06:12:30.910 --> 06:12:30.920 align:start position:0%
right I I don't think that um a
 
06:12:35.310 --> 06:12:35.320 align:start position:0%
community um is uh necessarily
 
06:12:38.590 --> 06:12:38.600 align:start position:0%
um focused on what is adequacy Grant
 
06:12:41.750 --> 06:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
versus other um grants they're
 
06:12:44.030 --> 06:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
interested in the amount of money um
 
06:12:47.030 --> 06:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
they get from the state whether it's um
 
06:12:51.150 --> 06:12:51.160 align:start position:0%
in collection of uh local taxes above
 
06:12:53.628 --> 06:12:53.638 align:start position:0%
the what's required or money from the
 
06:12:56.868 --> 06:12:56.878 align:start position:0%
state due to lower property values which
 
06:12:58.310 --> 06:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
for which they get
 
06:13:00.830 --> 06:13:00.840 align:start position:0%
money and and final follow up on it
 
06:13:02.628 --> 06:13:02.638 align:start position:0%
because it's just it's right right to
 
06:13:04.070 --> 06:13:04.080 align:start position:0%
that I'm not talking about from the
 
06:13:05.430 --> 06:13:05.440 align:start position:0%
community's perspective I'm talking
 
06:13:07.270 --> 06:13:07.280 align:start position:0%
about from the state's perspective
 
06:13:10.030 --> 06:13:10.040 align:start position:0%
should the state be issuing supplemental
 
06:13:13.070 --> 06:13:13.080 align:start position:0%
grants as part of the adequacy grant to
 
06:13:15.788 --> 06:13:15.798 align:start position:0%
other communities the way they the way
 
06:13:18.270 --> 06:13:18.280 align:start position:0%
you propose them them doing so for
 
06:13:21.708 --> 06:13:21.718 align:start position:0%
Tuftonboro um the state isn't um
 
06:13:23.868 --> 06:13:23.878 align:start position:0%
involved with these These are local
 
06:13:25.430 --> 06:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
taxes that are collected by the
 
06:13:27.510 --> 06:13:27.520 align:start position:0%
municipalities it just so happens
 
06:13:30.270 --> 06:13:30.280 align:start position:0%
because of um higher property values in
 
06:13:32.990 --> 06:13:33.000 align:start position:0%
some parts of the Town possibly uh the
 
06:13:35.350 --> 06:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
town collects more than is required
 
06:13:38.230 --> 06:13:38.240 align:start position:0%
State okay thank you very much should be
 
06:13:40.030 --> 06:13:40.040 align:start position:0%
noted that
 
06:13:42.590 --> 06:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
the the legislature and its wisdom
 
06:13:44.750 --> 06:13:44.760 align:start position:0%
struck out the fiscal capacity aspect of
 
06:13:47.030 --> 06:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
what we sent across the aisle or to the
 
06:13:48.670 --> 06:13:48.680 align:start position:0%
other side of the wall and there's only
 
06:13:50.190 --> 06:13:50.200 align:start position:0%
the extraordinary needs grant that we're
 
06:13:53.590 --> 06:13:53.600 align:start position:0%
looking at yes um are there any other
 
06:13:53.600 --> 06:13:55.350 align:start position:0%
looking at yes um are there any other
other

06:13:55.350 --> 06:13:55.360 align:start position:0%
other
 
06:13:57.270 --> 06:13:57.280 align:start position:0%
questions of the
 
06:13:59.548 --> 06:13:59.558 align:start position:0%
committee see represent mire you have
 
06:14:01.310 --> 06:14:01.320 align:start position:0%
your hand up yeah I just wanted to
 
06:14:04.350 --> 06:14:04.360 align:start position:0%
mention that Mr chairman um I looked up
 
06:14:06.948 --> 06:14:06.958 align:start position:0%
the bill you just mentioned and of
 
06:14:10.070 --> 06:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
interest is it was sent to the special
 
06:14:12.548 --> 06:14:12.558 align:start position:0%
committee on education funding
 
06:14:15.830 --> 06:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
reform so everything goes everything
 
06:14:18.110 --> 06:14:18.120 align:start position:0%
comes around goes around it's a circle
 
06:14:22.110 --> 06:14:22.120 align:start position:0%
is it absolutely represent fellows yes
 
06:14:26.670 --> 06:14:26.680 align:start position:0%
thank you since since we know that any
 
06:14:28.910 --> 06:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
of the municipalities that fall into
 
06:14:32.430 --> 06:14:32.440 align:start position:0%
this category of of getting more um if
 
06:14:35.510 --> 06:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
their swept being higher than their C
 
06:14:39.070 --> 06:14:39.080 align:start position:0%
than the cost of adequacy as calculated
 
06:14:41.150 --> 06:14:41.160 align:start position:0%
in the adequacy aid
 
06:14:44.910 --> 06:14:44.920 align:start position:0%
formula do you we know that um they get
 
06:14:47.110 --> 06:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
more than that we we know that those
 
06:14:49.350 --> 06:14:49.360 align:start position:0%
same communities don't get any of that
 
06:14:54.230 --> 06:14:54.240 align:start position:0%
extraordinary need money so do you think
 
06:14:55.750 --> 06:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
that any
 
06:14:59.868 --> 06:14:59.878 align:start position:0%
municipality could provide a a real
 
06:15:03.468 --> 06:15:03.478 align:start position:0%
adequate education with just the
 
06:15:06.230 --> 06:15:06.240 align:start position:0%
$4,200 per student and those
 
06:15:11.070 --> 06:15:11.080 align:start position:0%
differentiated amounts um uh there are
 
06:15:13.310 --> 06:15:13.320 align:start position:0%
uh communities and school districts that
 
06:15:17.070 --> 06:15:17.080 align:start position:0%
do do that yes um and you know look at
 
06:15:20.310 --> 06:15:20.320 align:start position:0%
the um what we've seen just um yesterday
 
06:15:24.590 --> 06:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
with uh uh nape scores in terms of you
 
06:15:27.750 --> 06:15:27.760 align:start position:0%
know what's happened since 2013 when we
 
06:15:31.468 --> 06:15:31.478 align:start position:0%
had um High nape scores maybe a high
 
06:15:35.190 --> 06:15:35.200 align:start position:0%
point in nape scores in 2013 for the of
 
06:15:38.270 --> 06:15:38.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um and there has been a
 
06:15:41.230 --> 06:15:41.240 align:start position:0%
little change in the nape scores in New
 
06:15:44.910 --> 06:15:44.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um but uh spending has
 
06:15:46.548 --> 06:15:46.558 align:start position:0%
increased by almost
 
06:15:49.510 --> 06:15:49.520 align:start position:0%
60% so you know I I don't think that
 
06:15:53.708 --> 06:15:53.718 align:start position:0%
spending is always um a a true measure
 
06:15:57.510 --> 06:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
of u u getting results in terms of
 
06:16:01.390 --> 06:16:01.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:04.468 --> 06:16:04.478 align:start position:0%
students if if if that was maybe I
 
06:16:06.788 --> 06:16:06.798 align:start position:0%
missed your question question I'm sorry
 
06:16:10.030 --> 06:16:10.040 align:start position:0%
so I'm thinking this the what's going on
 
06:16:13.910 --> 06:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
with remitting the swep is because the
 
06:16:17.230 --> 06:16:17.240 align:start position:0%
the municipality has to remit some of
 
06:16:20.430 --> 06:16:20.440 align:start position:0%
the swep because in the adequacy aid
 
06:16:22.948 --> 06:16:22.958 align:start position:0%
formula their cost of an adequate
 
06:16:26.670 --> 06:16:26.680 align:start position:0%
education calculated with that 4,200 per
 
06:16:31.990 --> 06:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
student and Etc um is less than what was
 
06:16:36.468 --> 06:16:36.478 align:start position:0%
D um raised through the swep so I'm just
 
06:16:39.030 --> 06:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
wondering I don't know of any school
 
06:16:42.910 --> 06:16:42.920 align:start position:0%
district that is has a expenditure per
 
06:16:45.670 --> 06:16:45.680 align:start position:0%
pupil that's in the 400
 
06:16:51.110 --> 06:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
$4,200 range I I'm not aware of
 
06:16:53.708 --> 06:16:53.718 align:start position:0%
that representative Damon did you have
 
06:16:57.548 --> 06:16:57.558 align:start position:0%
your hand up or I it was just okay
 
06:16:59.350 --> 06:16:59.360 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
06:17:01.670 --> 06:17:01.680 align:start position:0%
sure wait okay go
 
06:17:04.468 --> 06:17:04.478 align:start position:0%
ahead thank thank you very much Mr chair
 
06:17:06.868 --> 06:17:06.878 align:start position:0%
so um so you've you've talked about the
 
06:17:09.750 --> 06:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
example obviously in your your your home
 
06:17:12.270 --> 06:17:12.280 align:start position:0%
um community of of
 
06:17:15.628 --> 06:17:15.638 align:start position:0%
Tuftonboro and
 
06:17:19.150 --> 06:17:19.160 align:start position:0%
and and you know as far as as far as
 
06:17:24.548 --> 06:17:24.558 align:start position:0%
what what it looks like here um that um
 
06:17:24.558 --> 06:17:25.430 align:start position:0%
what what it looks like here um that um
that

06:17:25.430 --> 06:17:25.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:17:27.830 --> 06:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
Grant would be and this is according to
 
06:17:32.310 --> 06:17:32.320 align:start position:0%
the the education Department's um fiscal
 
06:17:36.830 --> 06:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
year 26 uh compar spreadsheet that they
 
06:17:38.990 --> 06:17:39.000 align:start position:0%
provided to us at our orientation a few
 
06:17:43.990 --> 06:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
weeks ago that that Grant would be
 
06:17:44.000 --> 06:17:47.030 align:start position:0%
weeks ago that that Grant would be
11,5

06:17:47.030 --> 06:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:49.868 --> 06:17:49.878 align:start position:0%
592 so and that's compared to the
 
06:17:52.628 --> 06:17:52.638 align:start position:0%
average ad quacy Grant of about
 
06:17:56.030 --> 06:17:56.040 align:start position:0%
$5,200 so so you know more than more
 
06:18:00.990 --> 06:18:01.000 align:start position:0%
than double that and um and you
 
06:18:03.990 --> 06:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
know just I'm just talking about this
 
06:18:06.070 --> 06:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
from a fairness standpoint that where
 
06:18:07.990 --> 06:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
the average adequacy Grant is
 
06:18:10.948 --> 06:18:10.958 align:start position:0%
$5,200 and the one to tuft and burrow is
 
06:18:13.230 --> 06:18:13.240 align:start position:0%
more than double that uh from the you
 
06:18:16.190 --> 06:18:16.200 align:start position:0%
know the adequacy grant that is is that
 
06:18:19.190 --> 06:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
fair and then to and then to go beyond
 
06:18:22.510 --> 06:18:22.520 align:start position:0%
that the the one for Newcastle is
 
06:18:23.548 --> 06:18:23.558 align:start position:0%
actually $3
 
06:18:28.510 --> 06:18:28.520 align:start position:0%
38,3 53 per pupil compared to the $5,200
 
06:18:30.868 --> 06:18:30.878 align:start position:0%
and and do do find that fair should
 
06:18:34.948 --> 06:18:34.958 align:start position:0%
Tuftonboro get get the 38,000 you know
 
06:18:38.510 --> 06:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
353 that Newcastle is getting my my
 
06:18:41.390 --> 06:18:41.400 align:start position:0%
bill's not intended to address fairness
 
06:18:44.670 --> 06:18:44.680 align:start position:0%
it's just uh intended to clarify Uh
 
06:18:47.230 --> 06:18:47.240 align:start position:0%
current law and the use of those funds
 
06:18:49.230 --> 06:18:49.240 align:start position:0%
okay thank you further questions from
 
06:18:51.708 --> 06:18:51.718 align:start position:0%

I am a project manager for the town of
 
06:19:20.070 --> 06:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
Newington and also their representative
 
06:19:23.270 --> 06:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
uh uh the uh education Coalition uh
 
06:19:25.230 --> 06:19:25.240 align:start position:0%
communities 2.0 where I also serve as
 
06:19:30.070 --> 06:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
the vice chair um our um group uh rises
 
06:19:35.350 --> 06:19:35.360 align:start position:0%
in support of uh uh houseb one yeah
 
06:19:39.030 --> 06:19:39.040 align:start position:0%
137 and uh mainly for the state state of
 
06:19:41.030 --> 06:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
reasons that representative cardelli
 
06:19:44.750 --> 06:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
spoke to in terms of uh it's codifying
 
06:19:47.788 --> 06:19:47.798 align:start position:0%
and um
 
06:19:52.190 --> 06:19:52.200 align:start position:0%
uh making it specific as to all these
 
06:19:54.948 --> 06:19:54.958 align:start position:0%
excess funds however you describe them
 
06:19:56.948 --> 06:19:56.958 align:start position:0%
are being used in our communities for
 
06:19:59.628 --> 06:19:59.638 align:start position:0%
Education P purposes uh I know of no
 
06:20:01.788 --> 06:20:01.798 align:start position:0%
other community that where um they're
 
06:20:04.190 --> 06:20:04.200 align:start position:0%
used otherwise um because we're required
 
06:20:05.708 --> 06:20:05.718 align:start position:0%
to turn those over to the school
 
06:20:07.830 --> 06:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
districts that uh uh serve our
 
06:20:11.190 --> 06:20:11.200 align:start position:0%
communities so um beyond that I'll I'll
 
06:20:14.510 --> 06:20:14.520 align:start position:0%
be brief in terms of uh I incorporate
 
06:20:16.350 --> 06:20:16.360 align:start position:0%
all the comments under
 
06:20:19.990 --> 06:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
675 uh that um my colleague Mark takoto
 
06:20:22.548 --> 06:20:22.558 align:start position:0%
uh said in terms of um you know swep and
 
06:20:26.548 --> 06:20:26.558 align:start position:0%
and our viewpoints uh on on the transfer
 
06:20:27.910 --> 06:20:27.920 align:start position:0%
uh and we believe that it's more
 
06:20:29.270 --> 06:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
Equitable and fair to have the
 
06:20:31.830 --> 06:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
communities uh that generate those funds
 
06:20:34.670 --> 06:20:34.680 align:start position:0%

untaxed in the way that we were talking
 
06:20:52.788 --> 06:20:52.798 align:start position:0%
about earlier to my knowledge they are
 
06:20:54.868 --> 06:20:54.878 align:start position:0%
the exempt properties to the Statewide
 
06:20:57.270 --> 06:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
education property tax but they are
 
06:21:00.190 --> 06:21:00.200 align:start position:0%
assessed the direct uh utility tax which
 
06:21:03.948 --> 06:21:03.958 align:start position:0%
is the 660 per th000 um that is directly
 
06:21:06.350 --> 06:21:06.360 align:start position:0%
assessed by the state of Hampshire can I
 
06:21:08.230 --> 06:21:08.240 align:start position:0%
follow up yes you may so do they pay
 
06:21:10.270 --> 06:21:10.280 align:start position:0%
your local school tax for example they
 
06:21:11.910 --> 06:21:11.920 align:start position:0%
