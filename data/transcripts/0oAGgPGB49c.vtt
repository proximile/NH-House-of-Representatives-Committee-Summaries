00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
in order to make a determination we will
 
00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:47.280 align:start position:0%

00:07:06.629 --> 00:07:06.639 align:start position:0%
about section three um
 
00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
he thinks we need to change the wording
 
00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
a little bit um
 
00:07:12.309 --> 00:07:12.319 align:start position:0%
if tyler is on the call if he's on the
 
00:07:12.319 --> 00:07:12.870 align:start position:0%
if tyler is on the call if he's on the
zoom

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:12.880 align:start position:0%
zoom
 
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
i'd like him to explain it he was going
 
00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:17.360 align:start position:0%
to send me some language but i haven't
 
00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:25.909 --> 00:07:25.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
i just did you'll be here in a second
 
00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:33.510 align:start position:0%
i just did you'll be here in a second
okay

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:36.309 --> 00:07:36.319 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chairman can you hear me
 
00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
i can hear your tyler
 
00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:41.360 align:start position:0%
yes just to yes i can hear you guys uh
 
00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
just to address representative abrami's
 
00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:46.720 align:start position:0%
uh concern here i
 
00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:48.160 align:start position:0%
happen to send it to your legislative
 
00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
email but i know there's a lot going on
 
00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
so it might have gotten lost
 
00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
in the kirkbuffle but section three uh
 
00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
as i read it right now it does mandate
 
00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
that a
 
00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
charity has to purchase a 25 cent ticket
 
00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
where a one dollar ticket
 
00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
is sold um you know as i told
 
00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:07.120 align:start position:0%
representative abrami
 
00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:08.720 align:start position:0%
the 25 cent ticket at least for our
 
00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:10.240 align:start position:0%
business diamond distributors and
 
00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:13.280 align:start position:0%
we sell paper
 
00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
lucky seven tickets to bingo's in
 
00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:16.710 align:start position:0%
lucky seven tickets to bingo's in
charities

00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:16.720 align:start position:0%
charities
 
00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:18.160 align:start position:0%
uh that's one of our least selling
 
00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
products so we find it kind of unfair
 
00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
to mandate that they have to purchase a
 
00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:23.680 align:start position:0%
product that
 
00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
you know we don't sell a lot of and they
 
00:08:27.749 --> 00:08:27.759 align:start position:0%
probably don't have many consumers
 
00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:30.240 align:start position:0%
who are players who purchase these uh
 
00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:30.869 align:start position:0%
who are players who purchase these uh
tickets

00:08:30.869 --> 00:08:30.879 align:start position:0%
tickets
 
00:08:33.269 --> 00:08:33.279 align:start position:0%
uh there is a small market for 25 cent
 
00:08:33.279 --> 00:08:34.070 align:start position:0%
uh there is a small market for 25 cent
tickets

00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
tickets
 
00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
but we don't believe that it should be
 
00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:38.560 align:start position:0%
mandated so i have some language that
 
00:08:40.709 --> 00:08:40.719 align:start position:0%
just states you know the price of a
 
00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:42.640 align:start position:0%
ticket shall not exceed a dollar
 
00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:44.320 align:start position:0%
and then it strikes the language stating
 
00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
that it they must
 
00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:48.160 align:start position:0%
shall sell a 25 cent ticket where a
 
00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
dollar ticket is sold
 
00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:52.640 align:start position:0%
and i know that language of mandating
 
00:08:53.269 --> 00:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
that a
 
00:08:55.269 --> 00:08:55.279 align:start position:0%
where a dollar ticket is sold a 50 cent
 
00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:57.680 align:start position:0%
ticket must also be sold as part of the
 
00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:00.240 align:start position:0%
uh compromise from last year's
 
00:09:01.269 --> 00:09:01.279 align:start position:0%
legislation that
 
00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
created the dollar ticket so i did not
 
00:09:05.829 --> 00:09:05.839 align:start position:0%
touch that language i simply uh in the
 
00:09:07.509 --> 00:09:07.519 align:start position:0%
language that i proposed or will i'll
 
00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:08.720 align:start position:0%
send it to the committee
 
00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:10.720 align:start position:0%
destruct the section that said we shall
 
00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:20.829 --> 00:09:20.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:20.839 --> 00:09:23.190 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:23.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:09:27.829 --> 00:09:27.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:30.949 --> 00:09:30.959 align:start position:0%
you're muted sorry
 
00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
i think that the phone in attendees is
 
00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:34.880 align:start position:0%
mary griffin and i
 
00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
ask that she'd be allowed to participate
 
00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:52.389 --> 00:09:52.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
to contest the the
 
00:09:57.670 --> 00:09:57.680 align:start position:0%
the other parts of the bill and i don't
 
00:09:59.110 --> 00:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
know does that mean
 
00:10:02.389 --> 00:10:02.399 align:start position:0%
on just bringing in
 
00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
and amendment to i think it's delete
 
00:10:08.069 --> 00:10:08.079 align:start position:0%
both of them i thought we were going to
 
00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
discuss all this stuff again um
 
00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
but they do uh complete
 
00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:18.320 align:start position:0%
turning these machines into
 
00:10:22.069 --> 00:10:22.079 align:start position:0%
semi-slot machines and allow them
 
00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
on in another bill to go into
 
00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:29.200 align:start position:0%
just about every place in new hampshire
 
00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
that might
 
00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
and and i
 
00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
i know this may be a losing argument at
 
00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
this point
 
00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
but um turning ourselves into oregon
 
00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem like a great idea
 
00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:52.720 align:start position:0%
thank you representative uh
 
00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
representative romney uh yeah thank you
 
00:10:57.509 --> 00:10:57.519 align:start position:0%

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:00.640 align:start position:0%
so i'll let me take a look at the
 
00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
language that uh
 
00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
tyler is talking about and then uh i may
 
00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
just do open amendment but
 
00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:08.560 align:start position:0%
susan if you representative army if you
 
00:11:10.389 --> 00:11:10.399 align:start position:0%
want to do an amendment
 
00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:13.120 align:start position:0%
uh i'll share this with you and you may
 
00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:14.560 align:start position:0%
also want to incorporate it into your
 
00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:15.829 align:start position:0%
also want to incorporate it into your
amendment

00:11:15.829 --> 00:11:15.839 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:18.240 align:start position:0%
yes yes i would like to incorporate the
 
00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
25 cent part
 
00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:22.240 align:start position:0%
and i think representative griffin is in
 
00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
favor of that too but if that is her i
 
00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:24.790 align:start position:0%
favor of that too but if that is her i
think

00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:26.800 align:start position:0%
it would be nice if she could be brought
 
00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:28.480 align:start position:0%
in thank you
 
00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
let's see i allowed that person
 
00:11:35.269 --> 00:11:35.279 align:start position:0%
to speak so if it is mary maybe she can
 
00:11:35.279 --> 00:11:37.269 align:start position:0%
to speak so if it is mary maybe she can
um

00:11:37.269 --> 00:11:37.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:40.720 align:start position:0%
okay the one with the phone ending zero
 
00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
star six i believe
 
00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:52.240 align:start position:0%
christina correct me if i'm wrong about
 
00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
that star six to talk
 
00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:56.720 align:start position:0%
i believe that's correct um my
 
00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
understanding is that
 
00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
um representative griffin's ends in zero
 
00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:01.269 align:start position:0%
um representative griffin's ends in zero
um

00:12:01.269 --> 00:12:01.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:04.160 align:start position:0%
six uh five nine nine five nine is what
 
00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:05.120 align:start position:0%
i believe it is
 
00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:10.720 align:start position:0%
yes i don't think it's her oh
 
00:12:12.949 --> 00:12:12.959 align:start position:0%
mr chair christine is on for another a
 
00:12:13.829 --> 00:12:13.839 align:start position:0%
different bill
 
00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
um okay so we didn't find
 
00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
no no and again
 
00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
was what was your position on the 25
 
00:12:42.389 --> 00:12:42.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:46.069 --> 00:12:46.079 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm in favor of making it optional i
 
00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
realized i mean 25 cents
 
00:12:50.389 --> 00:12:50.399 align:start position:0%
was more money when it was put in than
 
00:12:52.389 --> 00:12:52.399 align:start position:0%
it is now
 
00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
it's kind of like having the penny
 
00:12:55.509 --> 00:12:55.519 align:start position:0%
auntie bingo that
 
00:12:58.870 --> 00:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
that i know about right
 
00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:02.240 align:start position:0%
and and the bill as written right now
 
00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
says the organization shall offer 25
 
00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:09.680 align:start position:0%
and 50 tickets for sale and so
 
00:13:13.829 --> 00:13:13.839 align:start position:0%
and so you agree with the amendment
 
00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:16.160 align:start position:0%
i agree with that amendment i just don't
 
00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:19.200 align:start position:0%
like sections one and two
 
00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
okay all right
 
00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:30.160 align:start position:0%

um yeah i my understanding is that you
 
00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
oppose the bill
 
00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
and um that that relates to
 
00:13:57.110 --> 00:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
the provision that makes the
 
00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:00.880 align:start position:0%
availability of paper
 
00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
tickets is that the right word for paper
 
00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
results uh
 
00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
um optional is that correct
 
00:14:12.069 --> 00:14:12.079 align:start position:0%
correct uh diamond distributors opposes
 
00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
section one
 
00:14:16.629 --> 00:14:16.639 align:start position:0%
into the bill okay uh so
 
00:14:19.829 --> 00:14:19.839 align:start position:0%
on that uh
 
00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
option i'm i'm wondering if you have
 
00:14:23.189 --> 00:14:23.199 align:start position:0%
information or your
 
00:14:26.389 --> 00:14:26.399 align:start position:0%
perspective on what uh
 
00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:29.680 align:start position:0%
eliminating that uh
 
00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:33.680 align:start position:0%
that paper requirement does in terms of
 
00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:34.310 align:start position:0%
that paper requirement does in terms of
the

00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:37.680 align:start position:0%
speed of betting that's enabled by the
 
00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:39.030 align:start position:0%
speed of betting that's enabled by the
machine

00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
machine
 
00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:41.440 align:start position:0%
how frequently can bets be made with or
 
00:14:44.949 --> 00:14:44.959 align:start position:0%
without the paper option
 
00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
i don't have any updated information as
 
00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:48.800 align:start position:0%
to how fast the ticket
 
00:14:51.509 --> 00:14:51.519 align:start position:0%
prints but i do know that through rule
 
00:14:51.519 --> 00:14:52.710 align:start position:0%
prints but i do know that through rule
making

00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:52.720 align:start position:0%
making
 
00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
last summer the speed of play on these
 
00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:56.230 align:start position:0%
last summer the speed of play on these
machines

00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:56.240 align:start position:0%
machines
 
00:14:58.470 --> 00:14:58.480 align:start position:0%
was increased so it was previously five
 
00:14:58.480 --> 00:14:59.350 align:start position:0%
was increased so it was previously five
seconds

00:14:59.350 --> 00:14:59.360 align:start position:0%
seconds
 
00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
a spin and now it is uh i think it was
 
00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:03.680 align:start position:0%
moved to two and a half but
 
00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
realistically it's a three
 
00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
is my understanding of how fast these
 
00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
machines play so it's every three
 
00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:09.430 align:start position:0%
machines play so it's every three
seconds

00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:09.440 align:start position:0%
seconds
 
00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:12.720 align:start position:0%
and i think the printing may be able to
 
00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:13.360 align:start position:0%
keep up
 
00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
with that but there could be somebody
 
00:15:16.629 --> 00:15:16.639 align:start position:0%
else here who is more
 
00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
in tune with how these machines function
 
00:15:19.829 --> 00:15:19.839 align:start position:0%
these days that could probably answer
 
00:15:19.839 --> 00:15:20.629 align:start position:0%
these days that could probably answer
that

00:15:20.629 --> 00:15:20.639 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
but my understanding is they're set at
 
00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:24.320 align:start position:0%
three seconds now or they have
 
00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:25.600 align:start position:0%
through rules they can be set at three
 
00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:27.750 align:start position:0%
through rules they can be set at three
seconds

00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:27.760 align:start position:0%
seconds
 
00:15:29.829 --> 00:15:29.839 align:start position:0%
okay well thank you that's very very
 
00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
helpful to have that three seconds
 
00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:44.389 --> 00:15:44.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:47.600 align:start position:0%
uh is john conforty one of the lottery
 
00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:49.910 align:start position:0%
uh is john conforty one of the lottery
people

00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:15:53.269 --> 00:15:53.279 align:start position:0%
yes i can let him in i have to be raised
 
00:15:55.749 --> 00:15:55.759 align:start position:0%
his hand
 
00:15:59.430 --> 00:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
oh christina did christine is our um
 
00:16:03.509 --> 00:16:03.519 align:start position:0%
are jennifer for today oh i'm sorry
 
00:16:05.189 --> 00:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
i confuse it with somebody else that's
 
00:16:13.509 --> 00:16:13.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:15.749 --> 00:16:15.759 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chairman john conforti
 
00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:17.360 align:start position:0%
uh chief compliance officer for the new
 
00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire lottery i'm happy to answer
 
00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:22.480 align:start position:0%
any questions that i can do you have any
 
00:16:25.509 --> 00:16:25.519 align:start position:0%
information on how fast
 
00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:28.480 align:start position:0%
read-a-play could be for machines that
 
00:16:29.189 --> 00:16:29.199 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:32.480 align:start position:0%
dispensing my understanding
 
00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
is that the um the timing as as was
 
00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
indicated is set by rules and
 
00:16:41.189 --> 00:16:41.199 align:start position:0%
that the um the printing mechanism is
 
00:16:41.199 --> 00:16:41.590 align:start position:0%
that the um the printing mechanism is
not

00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:44.320 align:start position:0%
going to be uh a determining factor in
 
00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:44.870 align:start position:0%
going to be uh a determining factor in
how

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
how
 
00:16:48.829 --> 00:16:48.839 align:start position:0%
fast the the game play uh would be
 
00:16:48.839 --> 00:16:52.550 align:start position:0%
fast the the game play uh would be
allowed

00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:59.829 --> 00:16:59.839 align:start position:0%
anything that is in roles now
 
00:17:04.309 --> 00:17:04.319 align:start position:0%
or have they thought of anything
 
00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:07.360 align:start position:0%
the timing that they would incorporate
 
00:17:11.909 --> 00:17:11.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
uh representative major i don't believe
 
00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
that we've
 
00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:18.400 align:start position:0%
had any discussions about um how we
 
00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:19.029 align:start position:0%
had any discussions about um how we
would

00:17:19.029 --> 00:17:19.039 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
um address any of these changes and
 
00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:22.720 align:start position:0%
rules other than
 
00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
um obviously making sure that the rules
 
00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
conform to the to the change regarding
 
00:17:29.669 --> 00:17:29.679 align:start position:0%
deal size
 
00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:32.720 align:start position:0%
and you know that the payment would be
 
00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:35.440 align:start position:0%
based on the 3 500 tickets as opposed to
 
00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:35.830 align:start position:0%
based on the 3 500 tickets as opposed to
the

00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:17:39.669 --> 00:17:39.679 align:start position:0%
um as opposed to one deal
 
00:17:42.549 --> 00:17:42.559 align:start position:0%
um but i don't believe that we are
 
00:17:42.559 --> 00:17:43.750 align:start position:0%
um but i don't believe that we are
anticipating

00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
anticipating
 
00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:47.600 align:start position:0%
um other rule changes other than
 
00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
um specifically aligning the rules with
 
00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
the new statutory language
 
00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
right and there's no statutory language
 
00:17:58.630 --> 00:17:58.640 align:start position:0%
that suggests how much how smoothly
 
00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
these could be
 
00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
i don't believe that the timing of the
 
00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:06.720 align:start position:0%
machines is addressed in statute
 
00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:09.990 align:start position:0%
machines is addressed in statute
okay

00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
any further questions representative
 
00:18:14.789 --> 00:18:14.799 align:start position:0%
alani followed by ruxin ames
 
00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
oh no i'm not on anymore
 
00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you thank you mr chairman
 
00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
uh these machines
 
00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:28.640 align:start position:0%
were approved reluctantly by
 
00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
our committee as dispensing machines
 
00:18:37.029 --> 00:18:37.039 align:start position:0%
on during the hearing on
 
00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:42.640 align:start position:0%
charlie told us that they don't dispense
 
00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
they have been converted because
 
00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:48.400 align:start position:0%
we didn't nail down every little piece
 
00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:50.480 align:start position:0%
of the language of how these machines
 
00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:51.750 align:start position:0%
of the language of how these machines
work

00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
they have been converted into
 
00:18:57.990 --> 00:18:58.000 align:start position:0%
uh video
 
00:19:01.029 --> 00:19:01.039 align:start position:0%
lottery machines essentially on
 
00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:05.200 align:start position:0%
by putting out on
 
00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
the the result on the
 
00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
monitor making it unnecessary to have
 
00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:15.200 align:start position:0%
look at a ticket so you can do it a lot
 
00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:16.630 align:start position:0%
look at a ticket so you can do it a lot
faster

00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:16.640 align:start position:0%
faster
 
00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
when you when it was a dispensing
 
00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:20.960 align:start position:0%
machine which is what we thought we were
 
00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:21.990 align:start position:0%
machine which is what we thought we were
approving

00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
approving
 
00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
on the ticket drop down you had to pick
 
00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
up the ticket and look at it
 
00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
so there was considerably more time
 
00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
involved now that they've eliminated
 
00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
that by allowing it to be on the monitor
 
00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:42.240 align:start position:0%
on the the debate that we're having
 
00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:46.880 align:start position:0%
essentially is whether we are going to
 
00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:51.200 align:start position:0%
just sanction in law what is already
 
00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
been done by the lottery commission
 
00:19:59.430 --> 00:19:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
representative elliot followed by
 
00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
representative doucet
 
00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
i have a question for mr clark uh is it
 
00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
my understanding that you were opposed
 
00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:19.360 align:start position:0%
to the 25 cent and the 50
 
00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
ticket because and i asked that question
 
00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:23.990 align:start position:0%
ticket because and i asked that question
because

00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:20:28.149 --> 00:20:28.159 align:start position:0%
in most of the casinos that i've been to
 
00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
um even have penny machines
 
00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:35.440 align:start position:0%
so my understanding or of
 
00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
opinion is that this is for the poor
 
00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:38.549 align:start position:0%
opinion is that this is for the poor
people

00:20:38.549 --> 00:20:38.559 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
who like to gamble uh so
 
00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
i i don't understand why you want to
 
00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:46.549 align:start position:0%
i i don't understand why you want to
eliminate

00:20:46.549 --> 00:20:46.559 align:start position:0%
eliminate
 
00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
uh the 25 cent or 50 cent
 
00:20:54.789 --> 00:20:54.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:20:58.230 --> 00:20:58.240 align:start position:0%
representative elliott um
 
00:20:59.909 --> 00:20:59.919 align:start position:0%
just to clarify there might be a slight
 
00:20:59.919 --> 00:21:01.270 align:start position:0%
just to clarify there might be a slight
misunderstanding

00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding
 
00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:04.480 align:start position:0%
we do not oppose a 50 cent or
 
00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:06.640 align:start position:0%
uh the dollar ticket at this point it's
 
00:21:07.909 --> 00:21:07.919 align:start position:0%
a point in time and you know we
 
00:21:09.029 --> 00:21:09.039 align:start position:0%
absolutely support
 
00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:11.360 align:start position:0%
bringing back the 25 cent ticket we
 
00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:13.360 align:start position:0%
think it was a
 
00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:16.720 align:start position:0%
a oversight
 
00:21:18.789 --> 00:21:18.799 align:start position:0%
last year you know when the language was
 
00:21:20.549 --> 00:21:20.559 align:start position:0%
drafted for the dollar ticket
 
00:21:23.669 --> 00:21:23.679 align:start position:0%
um that we accidentally removed the 25
 
00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
cent ticket and i
 
00:21:27.669 --> 00:21:27.679 align:start position:0%
you know we we do sell or we did sell 25
 
00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
cent tickets just not many of them
 
00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
we don't sell any dollar tickets uh we
 
00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
sell all 50 cent tickets to bingo's
 
00:21:35.909 --> 00:21:35.919 align:start position:0%
in fraternal organizations so that they
 
00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
can sell them
 
00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
at their bingo or in their fraternal
 
00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:41.909 align:start position:0%
at their bingo or in their fraternal
hall

00:21:41.909 --> 00:21:41.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:48.640 align:start position:0%
okay when i look at the screen it's
 
00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:50.960 align:start position:0%
different than the participants
 
00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:58.070 --> 00:21:58.080 align:start position:0%

halls have those because they don't want
 
00:22:35.909 --> 00:22:35.919 align:start position:0%
somebody walking around selling the
 
00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:37.360 align:start position:0%
tickets so they just go to the machine
 
00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
and they can
 
00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:41.840 align:start position:0%

pull tabs as they want so those still
exist

00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:46.720 align:start position:0%
exist
 
00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
and uh representative amy's talking
 
00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
about the
 
00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
the electronic version of that the
 
00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
electronic uh
 
00:22:59.029 --> 00:22:59.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:02.400 align:start position:0%
uh representative tucker yes i would
 
00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
very much
 
00:23:05.909 --> 00:23:05.919 align:start position:0%
like uh to know what representative
 
00:23:05.919 --> 00:23:06.710 align:start position:0%
like uh to know what representative
griffin

00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
griffin
 
00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
thinks of this since we
 
00:23:13.029 --> 00:23:13.039 align:start position:0%
wanted to get information today as to
 
00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
different opinions and perhaps someone
 
00:23:18.149 --> 00:23:18.159 align:start position:0%
could be delegated to
 
00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:21.200 align:start position:0%
talk with her and
 
00:23:23.909 --> 00:23:23.919 align:start position:0%
find out her opinion before it comes up
 
00:23:23.919 --> 00:23:24.789 align:start position:0%
find out her opinion before it comes up
again

00:23:24.789 --> 00:23:24.799 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:27.280 align:start position:0%
so we're ready to understand she's sort
 
00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:28.240 align:start position:0%
of the expert
 
00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:31.360 align:start position:0%
i have uh been
 
00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:34.480 align:start position:0%
impressed with her ability to be
 
00:23:36.789 --> 00:23:36.799 align:start position:0%
persuasive too and
 
00:23:40.149 --> 00:23:40.159 align:start position:0%
and to protect our seniors yeah
 
00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
exactly but uh i think this is very
 
00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
important i think that uh
 
00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
representative almy has brought up some
 
00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:52.480 align:start position:0%
concerning uh points and
 
00:23:56.149 --> 00:23:56.159 align:start position:0%
i'm now conflicted as to how i uh
 
00:23:59.350 --> 00:23:59.360 align:start position:0%
understand this these issues and it's
 
00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
getting murkier
 
00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
by the minute and so uh
 
00:24:07.029 --> 00:24:07.039 align:start position:0%
i'd like our expert to speak up
 
00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:09.710 align:start position:0%
sex can you check with uh representative
 
00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:12.390 align:start position:0%
sex can you check with uh representative
[Music]

00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:12.400 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
i will do so uh again mr chair like she
 
00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
said she's unavailable to
 
00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:20.720 align:start position:0%
uh speak to the group today and um
 
00:24:22.149 --> 00:24:22.159 align:start position:0%
reach out i'll ever reach out to you
 
00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:24.240 align:start position:0%
directly mr jammer yeah
 
00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
that's an thank you uh
 
00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:35.200 align:start position:0%
i called her up last night because i
 
00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to know what she thought of these
 
00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:37.590 align:start position:0%
wanted to know what she thought of these
things

00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
i discovered she has not seen any of
 
00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:41.440 align:start position:0%
these bills
 
00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:43.120 align:start position:0%
they are not sending them to her and
 
00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:44.480 align:start position:0%
obviously she can't
 
00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
get them herself um
 
00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
so i tried to read her
 
00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
two of them and
 
00:24:55.909 --> 00:24:55.919 align:start position:0%
that is obviously very difficult for
 
00:24:59.510 --> 00:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
someone who's 96 years old
 
00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
she did say that
 
00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
on that she
 
00:25:08.789 --> 00:25:08.799 align:start position:0%
disagreed that she agreed with uh
 
00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:12.840 align:start position:0%
mr clark's idea on the 25
 
00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:16.240 align:start position:0%
ticket on but
 
00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
that she didn't want to see
 
00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
her low-income seniors
 
00:25:27.269 --> 00:25:27.279 align:start position:0%
on lose all of their money in
 
00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
in machine gaming
 
00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
and she didn't put it quite that way but
 
00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:36.400 align:start position:0%
but that she was worried about these
 
00:25:38.789 --> 00:25:38.799 align:start position:0%
machines going to the electronic side
 
00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:39.200 align:start position:0%
and i
 
00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
i wish she'd be able to uh she did last
 
00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:42.870 align:start position:0%
i wish she'd be able to uh she did last
night

00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
night
 
00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
tell me that she was going to be on
 
00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:46.149 align:start position:0%
tell me that she was going to be on
today

00:25:46.149 --> 00:25:46.159 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
so mr chairman yes
 
00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:51.440 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to put words in in the
 
00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:52.630 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to put words in in the
representative's

00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:52.640 align:start position:0%
representative's
 
00:25:54.789 --> 00:25:54.799 align:start position:0%
mouth i spoke to her not five minutes
 
00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
ago and she didn't
 
00:25:58.070 --> 00:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
make a definitive uh decision as to
 
00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:00.640 align:start position:0%
where she stands on this and like i said
 
00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
um short of her speaking directly to you
 
00:26:04.549 --> 00:26:04.559 align:start position:0%
or to this committee
 
00:26:07.269 --> 00:26:07.279 align:start position:0%
um i would caution others to do the same
 
00:26:07.279 --> 00:26:08.230 align:start position:0%
um i would caution others to do the same
thing

00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:08.240 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
so uh yes i will call her right now and
 
00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
have her uh get a hold of you
 
00:26:14.549 --> 00:26:14.559 align:start position:0%
mr chan but she's uh she's not well this
 
00:26:14.559 --> 00:26:15.830 align:start position:0%
mr chan but she's uh she's not well this

morning
 
00:26:17.909 --> 00:26:17.919 align:start position:0%
well maybe that would be very good
 
00:26:20.149 --> 00:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
because i was just trying to say that so
 
00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
that you could see that there was
 
00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:24.720 align:start position:0%
a debate in her mind at this point at
 
00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:27.269 align:start position:0%
a debate in her mind at this point at
least

00:26:27.269 --> 00:26:27.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:29.360 align:start position:0%

then

00:26:52.390 --> 00:26:52.400 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:55.600 align:start position:0%
mr chairman um john conforty seems to
 
00:26:57.909 --> 00:26:57.919 align:start position:0%

00:27:38.149 --> 00:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
clarification as you're
 
00:27:40.789 --> 00:27:40.799 align:start position:0%
as you're looking at this bill each of
 
00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
those machines does
 
00:27:45.029 --> 00:27:45.039 align:start position:0%
dispense a paper ticket
 
00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:47.440 align:start position:0%
um it's just that as a practical matter
 
00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
that the players tend to ignore those
 
00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:52.720 align:start position:0%
tickets as they're dispensed
 
00:27:56.710 --> 00:27:56.720 align:start position:0%

uh he feels that there occasionally will
 
00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:01.200 align:start position:0%
be an exception to the rule
 
00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
as to what constitutes a charity that's
 
00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:05.029 align:start position:0%
as to what constitutes a charity that's
eligible

00:30:05.029 --> 00:30:05.039 align:start position:0%
eligible
 
00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:08.000 align:start position:0%

00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:34.720 align:start position:0%
organization that would benefit from
 
00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:35.190 align:start position:0%
organization that would benefit from
this

00:30:35.190 --> 00:30:35.200 align:start position:0%

00:30:38.710 --> 00:30:38.720 align:start position:0%

john well thank you mr chairman thank
 
00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
you representative abrami yes
 
00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
um we had requested uh that
 
00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:53.440 align:start position:0%
representative abrami
 
00:30:56.789 --> 00:30:56.799 align:start position:0%
uh make this amendment um there are
 
00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:00.640 align:start position:0%
um isolated incidents where we have
 
00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
charities um that are bona fide
 
00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
charities doing
 
00:31:07.909 --> 00:31:07.919 align:start position:0%
uh work in uh new hampshire um
 
00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
that would um that meet the
 
00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:14.240 align:start position:0%
the spirit um and purpose of the statute
 
00:31:16.149 --> 00:31:16.159 align:start position:0%
but do not check all the boxes
 
00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:19.360 align:start position:0%
um with regard to um rep
 
00:31:21.190 --> 00:31:21.200 align:start position:0%
um either being registered with the
 
00:31:23.029 --> 00:31:23.039 align:start position:0%
secretary of state as a non-profit or
 
00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
with the attorney general's office
 
00:31:27.430 --> 00:31:27.440 align:start position:0%
um for one reason or another um i
 
00:31:29.669 --> 00:31:29.679 align:start position:0%
believe that feed new hampshire is
 
00:31:33.269 --> 00:31:33.279 align:start position:0%
uh on and can address their specific
 
00:31:36.549 --> 00:31:36.559 align:start position:0%
um circumstances um uh
 
00:31:39.909 --> 00:31:39.919 align:start position:0%
more directly but um there are there are
 
00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:41.440 align:start position:0%
circumstances where
 
00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
um for example a charity is an arm of a
 
00:31:49.029 --> 00:31:49.039 align:start position:0%
for-profit company and through oversight
 
00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
it hasn't been separated into a separate
 
00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:52.310 align:start position:0%
it hasn't been separated into a separate
non-profit

00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
non-profit
 
00:31:55.430 --> 00:31:55.440 align:start position:0%
um or it hasn't registered in time
 
00:31:58.549 --> 00:31:58.559 align:start position:0%
and certainly what we have found is
 
00:31:58.559 --> 00:31:58.870 align:start position:0%
and certainly what we have found is
there

00:31:58.870 --> 00:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:02.240 align:start position:0%
are worthy charities um who
 
00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
meet the requirements of
 
00:32:07.669 --> 00:32:07.679 align:start position:0%
doing non-profit work doing charitable
 
00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
work in the state
 
00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:10.880 align:start position:0%
they are not fly-by-night operations
 
00:32:12.789 --> 00:32:12.799 align:start position:0%
they are well established
 
00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
but their filing has not uh been at the
 
00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
secretary of state
 
00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:19.200 align:start position:0%
for the required amount of time um or
 
00:32:20.549 --> 00:32:20.559 align:start position:0%
there is some other
 
00:32:22.630 --> 00:32:22.640 align:start position:0%
very minor technical defect which
 
00:32:24.789 --> 00:32:24.799 align:start position:0%
prevents them from being licensed as a
 
00:32:24.799 --> 00:32:25.430 align:start position:0%
prevents them from being licensed as a
charitable

00:32:25.430 --> 00:32:25.440 align:start position:0%
charitable
 
00:32:28.549 --> 00:32:28.559 align:start position:0%
uh as a charity for gaming purposes
 
00:32:31.590 --> 00:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
so the intent of this amendment was to
 
00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:34.240 align:start position:0%
provide a mechanism for those very few
 
00:32:37.269 --> 00:32:37.279 align:start position:0%
circumstances um where an
 
00:32:39.909 --> 00:32:39.919 align:start position:0%
organization can demonstrate that they
 
00:32:39.919 --> 00:32:40.389 align:start position:0%
organization can demonstrate that they
are

00:32:40.389 --> 00:32:40.399 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:32:43.590 --> 00:32:43.600 align:start position:0%
a an established charity doing
 
00:32:46.630 --> 00:32:46.640 align:start position:0%
charitable work here in new hampshire
 
00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:48.240 align:start position:0%
that the funds from charitable gaming
 
00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:50.480 align:start position:0%
would remain within the state
 
00:32:52.230 --> 00:32:52.240 align:start position:0%
um and that there was a there's a
 
00:32:54.549 --> 00:32:54.559 align:start position:0%
justifiable reason why they're not able
 
00:32:55.830 --> 00:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
to meet one of the technical
 
00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:56.710 align:start position:0%
to meet one of the technical
requirements

00:32:56.710 --> 00:32:56.720 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
00:32:59.430 --> 00:32:59.440 align:start position:0%
of the statute we these are so
 
00:33:01.750 --> 00:33:01.760 align:start position:0%
infrequent that we didn't feel that a
 
00:33:04.789 --> 00:33:04.799 align:start position:0%
change of the um definitional
 
00:33:05.909 --> 00:33:05.919 align:start position:0%
requirements was
 
00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
appropriate but that there should be
 
00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
some mechanism
 
00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
to allow for these these one-offs um
 
00:33:15.509 --> 00:33:15.519 align:start position:0%
uh to to participate in charitable
 
00:33:15.519 --> 00:33:16.710 align:start position:0%
uh to to participate in charitable
gambling

00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:16.720 align:start position:0%
gambling
 
00:33:20.470 --> 00:33:20.480 align:start position:0%

circumstance

00:33:40.389 --> 00:33:40.399 align:start position:0%

00:34:52.389 --> 00:34:52.399 align:start position:0%
and disadvantage currently the way the
 
00:34:53.430 --> 00:34:53.440 align:start position:0%
rule is written
 
00:34:56.470 --> 00:34:56.480 align:start position:0%
we are not eligible to receive
 
00:34:59.510 --> 00:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
gay charitable gaming donations because
 
00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
although we are registered with the
 
00:35:02.950 --> 00:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
director of charitable trust
 
00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
we are not registered as a charitable
 
00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:11.440 align:start position:0%
organization with the state mostly
 
00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
actually all in part because of the way
 
00:35:15.109 --> 00:35:15.119 align:start position:0%
we are set up
 
00:35:17.589 --> 00:35:17.599 align:start position:0%
the trust is set up with three trustees
 
00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
and we have a board of nine community
 
00:35:21.349 --> 00:35:21.359 align:start position:0%
members who serve
 
00:35:25.510 --> 00:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
to make decisions about um how we
 
00:35:27.910 --> 00:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
raise funds as well as how we disperse
 
00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:28.950 align:start position:0%
raise funds as well as how we disperse
funds

00:35:28.950 --> 00:35:28.960 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:35:32.310 --> 00:35:32.320 align:start position:0%
if we were feeding h.org
 
00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
is a charitable arm of a
 
00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:40.240 align:start position:0%
for-profit company by registering
 
00:35:42.550 --> 00:35:42.560 align:start position:0%
with the state as a charitable
 
00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:43.670 align:start position:0%
with the state as a charitable
organization

00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
organization
 
00:35:47.589 --> 00:35:47.599 align:start position:0%
that would force us to have
 
00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:50.720 align:start position:0%
basically turn over the control
 
00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
of our trust that we built to
 
00:35:58.069 --> 00:35:58.079 align:start position:0%
serve what our customers our employees
 
00:36:00.710 --> 00:36:00.720 align:start position:0%
the family's elderly education and
 
00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:03.030 align:start position:0%
the family's elderly education and
disadvantage

00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
disadvantage
 
00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:07.480 align:start position:0%
and we would have to have five
 
00:36:09.829 --> 00:36:09.839 align:start position:0%
non-at least five board
 
00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
members that would control this
 
00:36:16.150 --> 00:36:16.160 align:start position:0%
charitable trust if we were to set it up
 
00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:17.440 align:start position:0%
that way
 
00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:21.040 align:start position:0%
um so really that's it
 
00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
i mean this simple language change that
 
00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:25.040 align:start position:0%
just says as long as we're registered
 
00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:26.240 align:start position:0%
with the director
 
00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:28.720 align:start position:0%
of charitable trust in new hampshire and
 
00:36:31.349 --> 00:36:31.359 align:start position:0%
our filings are up to date
 
00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:34.720 align:start position:0%
and we are at 501c3 which we check all
 
00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
of those boxes
 
00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:39.040 align:start position:0%
and we're not required to
 
00:36:41.829 --> 00:36:41.839 align:start position:0%
change the way we have set up our trust
 
00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:42.960 align:start position:0%
to serve
 
00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:46.240 align:start position:0%
our communities um we would be eligible
 
00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
for this gaming
 
00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:50.480 align:start position:0%
we're currently gaming donations where
 
00:36:53.990 --> 00:36:54.000 align:start position:0%

00:36:58.310 --> 00:36:58.320 align:start position:0%

00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:13.190 align:start position:0%
am okay with the amendment just not with
dependency

00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
dependency
 
00:37:16.310 --> 00:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
on gaming okay thank you uh
 
00:37:18.150 --> 00:37:18.160 align:start position:0%
representative brown
 
00:37:20.470 --> 00:37:20.480 align:start position:0%
actually um my hand was up from before
 
00:37:26.310 --> 00:37:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:32.310 --> 00:37:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:35.430 --> 00:37:35.440 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you um i just want to be
 
00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:36.550 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you um i just want to be
clear

00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:36.560 align:start position:0%
clear
 
00:37:39.990 --> 00:37:40.000 align:start position:0%
on what this amendment does um
 
00:37:42.150 --> 00:37:42.160 align:start position:0%
and i i'm handicapped because i don't
 
00:37:43.589 --> 00:37:43.599 align:start position:0%
seem to have
 
00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:45.680 align:start position:0%
the statute in front of my existing
 
00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
statute but uh
 
00:37:50.310 --> 00:37:50.320 align:start position:0%
but it's reassuring to to know that your
 
00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
organization is a 501c3
 
00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
and the problem you're having in
 
00:37:56.790 --> 00:37:56.800 align:start position:0%
countering is
 
00:38:00.069 --> 00:38:00.079 align:start position:0%
the registration requirement with the
 
00:38:01.990 --> 00:38:02.000 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office there's some
 
00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
variation there my question
 
00:38:11.349 --> 00:38:11.359 align:start position:0%
to you is if this amendment goes through
 
00:38:14.790 --> 00:38:14.800 align:start position:0%
would the requirement that um
 
00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
the organization your organization
 
00:38:19.910 --> 00:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
would still have to demonstrate
 
00:38:22.069 --> 00:38:22.079 align:start position:0%
compliance with
 
00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
i don't quite know how to say this the
 
00:38:30.550 --> 00:38:30.560 align:start position:0%
charitable organization rules that lead
 
00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:30.870 align:start position:0%
charitable organization rules that lead
to

00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:30.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
your sighting 501c3 as a
 
00:38:39.510 --> 00:38:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:42.720 align:start position:0%
um we are more than happy to
 
00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:45.760 align:start position:0%
and able to um
 
00:38:50.150 --> 00:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:52.640 align:start position:0%
uh i i'm kind of trying to search for
 
00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:54.560 align:start position:0%
words like you are but all the filings
 
00:38:56.390 --> 00:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
that we have to do
 
00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
for both with the charitable trust
 
00:39:02.630 --> 00:39:02.640 align:start position:0%
division of new hampshire as well as the
 
00:39:05.430 --> 00:39:05.440 align:start position:0%
irs we are
 
00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
current with that and more than happy to
 
00:39:09.910 --> 00:39:09.920 align:start position:0%
continue being current with that i'm not
 
00:39:11.829 --> 00:39:11.839 align:start position:0%
sure if that is exactly what you are
 
00:39:11.839 --> 00:39:12.870 align:start position:0%
sure if that is exactly what you are
asking

00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:12.880 align:start position:0%
asking
 
00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:16.160 align:start position:0%
um we because because it's an
 
00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
arm of a for-profit business we do
 
00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
put a great deal of effort into
 
00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:26.720 align:start position:0%
the guarding any conflict of interest
 
00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
so we have separate attorneys for
 
00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:32.560 align:start position:0%
this charitable trust we have separate
 
00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
accountants for the charitable trust
 
00:39:38.390 --> 00:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
um we we do all of our
 
00:39:41.990 --> 00:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
diligence to ensure that there's not
 
00:39:44.069 --> 00:39:44.079 align:start position:0%
ever any question that the money is
 
00:39:45.670 --> 00:39:45.680 align:start position:0%
being used for anything
 
00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
but what we wanted it to be used for
 
00:39:49.750 --> 00:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
which is to serve
 
00:39:51.510 --> 00:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
other new hampshire charitable
 
00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
organizations we're basically a
 
00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:55.589 align:start position:0%
organizations we're basically a
fundraising

00:39:55.589 --> 00:39:55.599 align:start position:0%
fundraising
 
00:39:59.510 --> 00:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
machine for all these organizations in
 
00:40:00.390 --> 00:40:00.400 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:40:03.510 --> 00:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
and it allows we had a gaming
 
00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
a gaming organization reach out to us
 
00:40:10.470 --> 00:40:10.480 align:start position:0%
wanting to donate to us and then sort of
 
00:40:11.670 --> 00:40:11.680 align:start position:0%
hit a brick wall and
 
00:40:14.069 --> 00:40:14.079 align:start position:0%
unable to donate to us because of the
 
00:40:14.790 --> 00:40:14.800 align:start position:0%
way this
 
00:40:17.829 --> 00:40:17.839 align:start position:0%
rule is currently written
 
00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:20.720 align:start position:0%
okay okay thank you thank you uh follow
 
00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:22.710 align:start position:0%
okay okay thank you thank you uh follow
up

00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:22.720 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:40:24.470 --> 00:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
i guess it's not really a follow-up i
 
00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
think that
 
00:40:28.790 --> 00:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
it would be helpful to have lottery uh
 
00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:29.430 align:start position:0%
it would be helpful to have lottery uh
confirm

00:40:29.430 --> 00:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
confirm
 
00:40:32.870 --> 00:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
what requirement would would apply
 
00:40:36.230 --> 00:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
if this amendment were adopted uh
 
00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:40.160 align:start position:0%
with specific reference to 501 c
 
00:40:45.589 --> 00:40:45.599 align:start position:0%
3 and it's uh and the the group of 501c
 
00:40:48.710 --> 00:40:48.720 align:start position:0%
um provisions that organizations right
 
00:40:50.829 --> 00:40:50.839 align:start position:0%
now have to
 
00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:53.680 align:start position:0%
um demonstrate that they
 
00:41:00.309 --> 00:41:00.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:03.280 align:start position:0%
john thank you for the question
 
00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:03.990 align:start position:0%
john thank you for the question
representative

00:41:03.990 --> 00:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:41:07.270 --> 00:41:07.280 align:start position:0%
so r the intent of this
 
00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
um is um that it's a waiver provision
 
00:41:13.910 --> 00:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
and they would the um anyone who's
 
00:41:15.589 --> 00:41:15.599 align:start position:0%
applying for a waiver
 
00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
um would need to demonstrate that they
 
00:41:19.589 --> 00:41:19.599 align:start position:0%
are still organized for a charitable
 
00:41:19.599 --> 00:41:20.470 align:start position:0%
are still organized for a charitable
purpose

00:41:20.470 --> 00:41:20.480 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
00:41:24.069 --> 00:41:24.079 align:start position:0%
um obviously 5 501 c 3 designation or
 
00:41:26.390 --> 00:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
any of the other 501c designations would
 
00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:27.349 align:start position:0%
any of the other 501c designations would
be

00:41:27.349 --> 00:41:27.359 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:41:29.190 --> 00:41:29.200 align:start position:0%
probably important evidence of that it's
 
00:41:31.109 --> 00:41:31.119 align:start position:0%
not specifically called out
 
00:41:33.990 --> 00:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
in the amendment but our expectation
 
00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
would be that we wouldn't grant a waiver
 
00:41:39.109 --> 00:41:39.119 align:start position:0%
uh that that that anyone who's seeking a
 
00:41:39.910 --> 00:41:39.920 align:start position:0%
waiver is
 
00:41:44.550 --> 00:41:44.560 align:start position:0%
likely to um to have those 501c3
 
00:41:47.990 --> 00:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
um requirements uh
 
00:41:50.470 --> 00:41:50.480 align:start position:0%
be complying with those currently and
 
00:41:52.230 --> 00:41:52.240 align:start position:0%
would continue to
 
00:41:55.190 --> 00:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
um again this is really to address
 
00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:56.160 align:start position:0%
issues where
 
00:41:58.710 --> 00:41:58.720 align:start position:0%
the nature of the charity is such that
 
00:41:58.720 --> 00:41:59.349 align:start position:0%
the nature of the charity is such that
um

00:41:59.349 --> 00:41:59.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:01.829 --> 00:42:01.839 align:start position:0%
they're they're not either currently
 
00:42:03.589 --> 00:42:03.599 align:start position:0%
registered with the secretary of state
 
00:42:05.589 --> 00:42:05.599 align:start position:0%
as a non-profit
 
00:42:08.790 --> 00:42:08.800 align:start position:0%
or cannot as as feed new hampshire as
 
00:42:12.390 --> 00:42:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:15.109 --> 00:42:15.119 align:start position:0%
thank you john are you all set
 
00:42:15.119 --> 00:42:17.910 align:start position:0%
thank you john are you all set
representing

00:42:17.910 --> 00:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:20.950 --> 00:42:20.960 align:start position:0%
for the moment i i need to look i i i
 
00:42:22.630 --> 00:42:22.640 align:start position:0%
as i said i was handicapped i don't have
 
00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
the statute right in front of me i want
 
00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
to look closely at this and
 
00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
if um and be satisfied that
 
00:42:33.589 --> 00:42:33.599 align:start position:0%
that the allowance for a waiver doesn't
 
00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
reach into provisions that should under
 
00:42:41.670 --> 00:42:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:45.750 --> 00:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
and we'll be addressing this
 
00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:53.200 align:start position:0%
all right we have
 
00:42:55.270 --> 00:42:55.280 align:start position:0%
representative did you raise your hand
 
00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:56.550 align:start position:0%
representative did you raise your hand
again

00:42:56.550 --> 00:42:56.560 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:42:58.950 --> 00:42:58.960 align:start position:0%
yes i did i'd been i'd planned on
 
00:43:00.069 --> 00:43:00.079 align:start position:0%
speaking when we
 
00:43:02.550 --> 00:43:02.560 align:start position:0%
went off to the amendment i mean i
 
00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:06.240 align:start position:0%
planned on speaking about something else
 
00:43:10.309 --> 00:43:10.319 align:start position:0%
two things actually on
 
00:43:13.430 --> 00:43:13.440 align:start position:0%
both of them require more information
 
00:43:16.630 --> 00:43:16.640 align:start position:0%
or rather one of them does that is we
 
00:43:17.750 --> 00:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
were going to we
 
00:43:21.030 --> 00:43:21.040 align:start position:0%
asked at the first meeting i believe
 
00:43:25.670 --> 00:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
what are all of these c's 501 c's
 
00:43:29.589 --> 00:43:29.599 align:start position:0%
we still don't have a list of on maybe
 
00:43:31.510 --> 00:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
from charitable trusts i don't know who
 
00:43:32.870 --> 00:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
would give it to us
 
00:43:36.550 --> 00:43:36.560 align:start position:0%
of what is comprised
 
00:43:39.990 --> 00:43:40.000 align:start position:0%
by c4 which i know has
 
00:43:42.790 --> 00:43:42.800 align:start position:0%
a lot of political organizations in it
 
00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:43.589 align:start position:0%
a lot of political organizations in it
on

00:43:43.589 --> 00:43:43.599 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
c 8 7 8
 
00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:51.200 align:start position:0%
10 and 19.
 
00:43:53.430 --> 00:43:53.440 align:start position:0%
and i also would point out this is
 
00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:54.230 align:start position:0%
and i also would point out this is
charitable

00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:54.240 align:start position:0%
charitable
 
00:43:58.470 --> 00:43:58.480 align:start position:0%
gaming on expanding it to this
 
00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
extent would make it a lot
 
00:44:05.140 --> 00:44:05.150 align:start position:0%
harder unless we're going to have um
 
00:44:05.150 --> 00:44:06.790 align:start position:0%
harder unless we're going to have um
[Music]

00:44:06.790 --> 00:44:06.800 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:44:08.309 --> 00:44:08.319 align:start position:0%
thought parlors like the one that's
 
00:44:10.390 --> 00:44:10.400 align:start position:0%
going to be in lebanon everywhere in the
 
00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:11.030 align:start position:0%
going to be in lebanon everywhere in the
state

00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:44:14.550 --> 00:44:14.560 align:start position:0%
but that would probably help uh it would
 
00:44:16.630 --> 00:44:16.640 align:start position:0%
be considerably harder for any charity
 
00:44:17.829 --> 00:44:17.839 align:start position:0%
to get
 
00:44:21.190 --> 00:44:21.200 align:start position:0%
get a slot on
 
00:44:24.550 --> 00:44:24.560 align:start position:0%
and my other question
 
00:44:27.910 --> 00:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
but i would like to get a list of what
 
00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
kinds of organizations in somewhat more
 
00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:31.510 align:start position:0%
kinds of organizations in somewhat more
detail

00:44:31.510 --> 00:44:31.520 align:start position:0%
detail
 
00:44:34.829 --> 00:44:34.839 align:start position:0%
than just this is a civic organization
 
00:44:34.839 --> 00:44:36.069 align:start position:0%
than just this is a civic organization
on

00:44:36.069 --> 00:44:36.079 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:44:39.430 --> 00:44:39.440 align:start position:0%
are in these different categories
 
00:44:42.710 --> 00:44:42.720 align:start position:0%
and the other question is about
 
00:44:46.550 --> 00:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
uh section five which was added on
 
00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
is is just about bingo and it seems to
 
00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:50.710 align:start position:0%
is is just about bingo and it seems to
contradict

00:44:50.710 --> 00:44:50.720 align:start position:0%
contradict
 
00:44:55.430 --> 00:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
part of the bill we just discussed
 
00:44:59.510 --> 00:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:03.589 --> 00:45:03.599 align:start position:0%
deal means a single game of uncirculated
 
00:45:05.589 --> 00:45:05.599 align:start position:0%
lucky seven tickets bearing a serial
 
00:45:05.599 --> 00:45:08.309 align:start position:0%
lucky seven tickets bearing a serial
number

00:45:08.309 --> 00:45:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:11.510 --> 00:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
so i think we need to discuss that too
 
00:45:14.870 --> 00:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
thank you okay
 
00:45:16.630 --> 00:45:16.640 align:start position:0%
representative tucker you had your hand
 
00:45:19.030 --> 00:45:19.040 align:start position:0%
up i took it down
 
00:45:20.870 --> 00:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
because we seem to have moved on i see
 
00:45:23.109 --> 00:45:23.119 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:32.870 --> 00:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
representing hacks and fellows
 
00:45:34.710 --> 00:45:34.720 align:start position:0%
good morning i just was gonna follow up
 
00:45:37.030 --> 00:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
on representative almi's question
 
00:45:40.470 --> 00:45:40.480 align:start position:0%
about the irs codes that are listed
 
00:45:43.589 --> 00:45:43.599 align:start position:0%
on page uh i guess that's
 
00:45:47.109 --> 00:45:47.119 align:start position:0%
two of the bill or paragraph 15 of the
 
00:45:47.119 --> 00:45:48.950 align:start position:0%
two of the bill or paragraph 15 of the
bill

00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:45:54.790 --> 00:45:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:58.950 --> 00:45:58.960 align:start position:0%
it's us code 26 us code 501
 
00:46:02.069 --> 00:46:02.079 align:start position:0%
section c and if you
 
00:46:03.589 --> 00:46:03.599 align:start position:0%
look to the definitions section
 
00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
subsection four are social welfare
 
00:46:10.630 --> 00:46:10.640 align:start position:0%
um organizations so
 
00:46:15.190 --> 00:46:15.200 align:start position:0%
um like she was mentioning that's a
 
00:46:18.230 --> 00:46:18.240 align:start position:0%
pretty wide definition
 
00:46:20.309 --> 00:46:20.319 align:start position:0%
of what that is um but if you look at
 
00:46:22.710 --> 00:46:22.720 align:start position:0%
the code it does narrow it a bit down
 
00:46:25.750 --> 00:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
um specifically civic leagues or
 
00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:26.630 align:start position:0%
um specifically civic leagues or
organizations

00:46:26.630 --> 00:46:26.640 align:start position:0%

um subsection

association
 
00:47:49.750 --> 00:47:49.760 align:start position:0%
operating under the lodge system um but
 
00:47:51.430 --> 00:47:51.440 align:start position:0%
it would have either the net earnings of
 
00:47:53.109 --> 00:47:53.119 align:start position:0%
which are devoted exclusively to
 
00:47:53.119 --> 00:47:53.750 align:start position:0%

educational and fraternal purposes
 
00:48:02.710 --> 00:48:02.720 align:start position:0%
and uh or oh no i'm sorry it's a it's an
 
00:48:04.950 --> 00:48:04.960 align:start position:0%
and so it would have to be both
 
00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:06.309 align:start position:0%
and so it would have to be both
qualifications

00:48:06.309 --> 00:48:06.319 align:start position:0%
qualifications
 
00:48:08.710 --> 00:48:08.720 align:start position:0%
and which do not provide for payment of
 
00:48:09.510 --> 00:48:09.520 align:start position:0%
life sick
 
00:48:13.829 --> 00:48:13.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:17.990 --> 00:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
um subsection c19
 
00:48:23.510 --> 00:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:25.829 --> 00:48:25.839 align:start position:0%
is that page down here it's a post or
 
00:48:27.990 --> 00:48:28.000 align:start position:0%
organization of past or present members
 
00:48:30.390 --> 00:48:30.400 align:start position:0%
of the armed forces of the united states
 
00:48:33.270 --> 00:48:33.280 align:start position:0%
so think uh vfw or another auxiliary
 
00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:35.750 align:start position:0%
so think uh vfw or another auxiliary
unit

00:48:35.750 --> 00:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
unit
 
00:48:38.230 --> 00:48:38.240 align:start position:0%
or it's a trust or foundation for any
 
00:48:38.950 --> 00:48:38.960 align:start position:0%
post or
 
00:48:41.109 --> 00:48:41.119 align:start position:0%
such organization we'd have to be
 
00:48:42.630 --> 00:48:42.640 align:start position:0%
organize the united states
 
00:48:45.109 --> 00:48:45.119 align:start position:0%
and have at least 75 percent of the
 
00:48:46.549 --> 00:48:46.559 align:start position:0%
members of which
 
00:48:48.630 --> 00:48:48.640 align:start position:0%
our past or present members of the armed
 
00:48:49.829 --> 00:48:49.839 align:start position:0%
forces of the united states and
 
00:48:51.589 --> 00:48:51.599 align:start position:0%
substantially all of the other members
 
00:48:53.670 --> 00:48:53.680 align:start position:0%
of which are individuals who are cadets
 
00:48:56.150 --> 00:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
spouses widows widowers ancestors lineal
 
00:48:57.990 --> 00:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
descendants etc
 
00:48:59.589 --> 00:48:59.599 align:start position:0%
and have no part of the net earnings
 
00:49:01.190 --> 00:49:01.200 align:start position:0%
which adheres to the benefit of a
 
00:49:03.030 --> 00:49:03.040 align:start position:0%
private shareholder individual
 
00:49:04.549 --> 00:49:04.559 align:start position:0%
i think the important thing for the
 
00:49:06.230 --> 00:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
committee to consider is that there are
 
00:49:08.470 --> 00:49:08.480 align:start position:0%
several other subsections
 
00:49:11.910 --> 00:49:11.920 align:start position:0%
of the irs uh s code 501
 
00:49:14.950 --> 00:49:14.960 align:start position:0%
subsection c that are not included and i
 
00:49:16.470 --> 00:49:16.480 align:start position:0%
think this goes back to you know
 
00:49:19.109 --> 00:49:19.119 align:start position:0%
previous discussions we've had
 
00:49:22.309 --> 00:49:22.319 align:start position:0%
about you know this area of the the code
 
00:49:25.430 --> 00:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
you know there are other organizations
 
00:49:26.069 --> 00:49:26.079 align:start position:0%
that are
 
00:49:28.549 --> 00:49:28.559 align:start position:0%
excluded so for instance like teachers
 
00:49:28.559 --> 00:49:29.670 align:start position:0%
excluded so for instance like teachers
unions

00:49:29.670 --> 00:49:29.680 align:start position:0%
unions
 
00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
cemetery companies trusts
 
00:49:37.670 --> 00:49:37.680 align:start position:0%
um there are um
 
00:49:41.030 --> 00:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
you know other
 
00:49:44.230 --> 00:49:44.240 align:start position:0%
organizations in the sub chapter who
 
00:49:46.230 --> 00:49:46.240 align:start position:0%
are organized in such a way to benefit
 
00:49:47.589 --> 00:49:47.599 align:start position:0%
those members
 
00:49:50.230 --> 00:49:50.240 align:start position:0%
um internally and i'm not sure that it's
 
00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:52.390 align:start position:0%
um internally and i'm not sure that it's
um

00:49:52.390 --> 00:49:52.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:55.510 --> 00:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
the purpose of providing a charitable
 
00:49:58.870 --> 00:49:58.880 align:start position:0%
you know donation or or fund or
 
00:50:01.069 --> 00:50:01.079 align:start position:0%
contribution to these
 
00:50:03.829 --> 00:50:03.839 align:start position:0%
501cs is
 
00:50:06.870 --> 00:50:06.880 align:start position:0%
equal among the subsection 501c
 
00:50:09.670 --> 00:50:09.680 align:start position:0%
subsections so i just think it's worth
 
00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:10.790 align:start position:0%
subsections so i just think it's worth
considering

00:50:10.790 --> 00:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
considering
 
00:50:12.390 --> 00:50:12.400 align:start position:0%
obviously everyone will have their own
 
00:50:14.230 --> 00:50:14.240 align:start position:0%
opinions about
 
00:50:17.109 --> 00:50:17.119 align:start position:0%
how and which you know organizations are
 
00:50:18.470 --> 00:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
worthy of charitable
 
00:50:23.109 --> 00:50:23.119 align:start position:0%
um you know donations and contributions
 
00:50:24.470 --> 00:50:24.480 align:start position:0%
i'm just not sure that they're all
 
00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:26.150 align:start position:0%
i'm just not sure that they're all
equally

00:50:26.150 --> 00:50:26.160 align:start position:0%
equally
 
00:50:29.109 --> 00:50:29.119 align:start position:0%
you know benefiting those of the public
 
00:50:31.030 --> 00:50:31.040 align:start position:0%
sector or those of their internal
 
00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:32.309 align:start position:0%
sector or those of their internal
membership

00:50:32.309 --> 00:50:32.319 align:start position:0%
membership
 
00:50:34.950 --> 00:50:34.960 align:start position:0%
it's just something to consider in way
 
00:50:36.470 --> 00:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
so representative what is your
 
00:50:36.480 --> 00:50:39.349 align:start position:0%
so representative what is your
recommendation

00:50:39.349 --> 00:50:39.359 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
00:50:42.710 --> 00:50:42.720 align:start position:0%
um i'm not sure that formulated an
 
00:50:44.870 --> 00:50:44.880 align:start position:0%
opinion but i do think that the
 
00:50:47.430 --> 00:50:47.440 align:start position:0%
you know not each one of these 501c
 
00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:48.309 align:start position:0%
you know not each one of these 501c
subsections

00:50:48.309 --> 00:50:48.319 align:start position:0%
subsections
 
00:50:51.270 --> 00:50:51.280 align:start position:0%
in my opinion should be benefiting from
 
00:50:51.910 --> 00:50:51.920 align:start position:0%
a public
 
00:50:55.510 --> 00:50:55.520 align:start position:0%
charitable donation for instance
 
00:50:57.589 --> 00:50:57.599 align:start position:0%
you know fraternal lodges who are
 
00:50:57.599 --> 00:50:59.589 align:start position:0%
you know fraternal lodges who are
benefiting

00:50:59.589 --> 00:50:59.599 align:start position:0%
benefiting
 
00:51:02.630 --> 00:51:02.640 align:start position:0%
themselves for
 
00:51:04.630 --> 00:51:04.640 align:start position:0%
you know their own purposes to further
 
00:51:07.349 --> 00:51:07.359 align:start position:0%
their organizations
 
00:51:09.589 --> 00:51:09.599 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that we should be allowing
 
00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
them to benefit from public
 
00:51:14.230 --> 00:51:14.240 align:start position:0%
funds to support themselves internally i
 
00:51:16.230 --> 00:51:16.240 align:start position:0%
mean i'm not sure that that's the
 
00:51:18.390 --> 00:51:18.400 align:start position:0%
intent of the original bill if it was
 
00:51:21.349 --> 00:51:21.359 align:start position:0%
going directly to the community broadly
 
00:51:23.589 --> 00:51:23.599 align:start position:0%
perhaps it's just something you need to
 
00:51:25.349 --> 00:51:25.359 align:start position:0%
consider um
 
00:51:27.190 --> 00:51:27.200 align:start position:0%
do you feel that's something that should
 
00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:29.030 align:start position:0%
do you feel that's something that should
be

00:51:29.030 --> 00:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:51:33.030 --> 00:51:33.040 align:start position:0%
melded into the waiver requirement
 
00:51:34.549 --> 00:51:34.559 align:start position:0%
well i think the waiver requirement is
 
00:51:36.150 --> 00:51:36.160 align:start position:0%
actually a pretty strong
 
00:51:40.150 --> 00:51:40.160 align:start position:0%
um it's a strong argument for trying to
 
00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:40.870 align:start position:0%
um it's a strong argument for trying to
find

00:51:40.870 --> 00:51:40.880 align:start position:0%
find
 
00:51:43.990 --> 00:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
um other charitable trusts and other
 
00:51:45.750 --> 00:51:45.760 align:start position:0%
organizations that don't fit that
 
00:51:47.349 --> 00:51:47.359 align:start position:0%
two-year period
 
00:51:49.190 --> 00:51:49.200 align:start position:0%
under the secretary of state filing or i
 
00:51:51.750 --> 00:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
think it's one year sorry
 
00:51:55.910 --> 00:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
um it's it's important that a waiver
 
00:51:57.589 --> 00:51:57.599 align:start position:0%
should be allowed i think that
 
00:51:59.430 --> 00:51:59.440 align:start position:0%
especially if they're if those
 
00:52:01.109 --> 00:52:01.119 align:start position:0%
organizations have already qualified for
 
00:52:04.470 --> 00:52:04.480 align:start position:0%
a 501c3
 
00:52:07.510 --> 00:52:07.520 align:start position:0%
tax exempt status um but i
 
00:52:10.390 --> 00:52:10.400 align:start position:0%
i do have concerns about um for instance
 
00:52:10.790 --> 00:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:52:14.069 --> 00:52:14.079 align:start position:0%
it is possible to be a 501c3
 
00:52:17.510 --> 00:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
and have less than 20 of your revenue
 
00:52:21.990 --> 00:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
or your distributions being
 
00:52:25.430 --> 00:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
um allocated to lobbying efforts
 
00:52:27.510 --> 00:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
for instance so that could be a
 
00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:29.109 align:start position:0%
for instance so that could be a
political

00:52:29.109 --> 00:52:29.119 align:start position:0%
political
 
00:52:33.670 --> 00:52:33.680 align:start position:0%
subsection of that not 501c3
 
00:52:35.270 --> 00:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
those activities could be donated
 
00:52:37.190 --> 00:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
towards a specific
 
00:52:40.710 --> 00:52:40.720 align:start position:0%
issue area of a specific policy and
 
00:52:42.069 --> 00:52:42.079 align:start position:0%
um although they don't meet the
 
00:52:44.870 --> 00:52:44.880 align:start position:0%
threshold to be considered a lobbyist
 
00:52:47.510 --> 00:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
those are you know some lobbying
 
00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:48.549 align:start position:0%
those are you know some lobbying
activities

00:52:48.549 --> 00:52:48.559 align:start position:0%
activities
 
00:52:51.670 --> 00:52:51.680 align:start position:0%
so should we be supporting
 
00:52:54.710 --> 00:52:54.720 align:start position:0%
these subsections in those
 
00:52:58.870 --> 00:52:58.880 align:start position:0%
limited but possibly material
 
00:53:01.109 --> 00:53:01.119 align:start position:0%
activities and i just think it's you
 
00:53:02.950 --> 00:53:02.960 align:start position:0%
know we need to be aware that that is
 
00:53:05.670 --> 00:53:05.680 align:start position:0%
a possibility and then make our own
 
00:53:07.589 --> 00:53:07.599 align:start position:0%
decisions of whether or not
 
00:53:09.430 --> 00:53:09.440 align:start position:0%
you know new hampshire should be
 
00:53:10.870 --> 00:53:10.880 align:start position:0%
supporting that through
 
00:53:14.950 --> 00:53:14.960 align:start position:0%
legislation so um
 
00:53:16.630 --> 00:53:16.640 align:start position:0%
i think the waiver is important because
 
00:53:18.630 --> 00:53:18.640 align:start position:0%
it allows um
 
00:53:20.870 --> 00:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
pretty distinctively to say you know in
 
00:53:22.630 --> 00:53:22.640 align:start position:0%
this amendment that it would have
 
00:53:24.390 --> 00:53:24.400 align:start position:0%
these funds would have to be these
 
00:53:27.750 --> 00:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
organizations be operating
 
00:53:30.870 --> 00:53:30.880 align:start position:0%
and primarily in the state of new
 
00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:31.750 align:start position:0%
and primarily in the state of new
hampshire

00:53:31.750 --> 00:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:53:33.750 --> 00:53:33.760 align:start position:0%
and that the revenue raised by the
 
00:53:35.750 --> 00:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
organization participating would be used
 
00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:36.720 align:start position:0%
to benefit
 
00:53:38.710 --> 00:53:38.720 align:start position:0%
the state so i think that's an important
 
00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:39.829 align:start position:0%
the state so i think that's an important
caveat

00:53:39.829 --> 00:53:39.839 align:start position:0%
caveat
 
00:53:41.430 --> 00:53:41.440 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't want to lose that for any
 
00:53:44.390 --> 00:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:46.230 --> 00:53:46.240 align:start position:0%
i mean i guess the question is if
 
00:53:48.069 --> 00:53:48.079 align:start position:0%
they're applying this revenue towards a
 
00:53:49.349 --> 00:53:49.359 align:start position:0%
lobbying effort
 
00:53:52.790 --> 00:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
to the state of new hampshire issue area
 
00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:53.589 align:start position:0%
to the state of new hampshire issue area
that's

00:53:53.589 --> 00:53:53.599 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:53:55.670 --> 00:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
highly divisive is that something we
 
00:53:58.230 --> 00:53:58.240 align:start position:0%
want to support
 
00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
could you outline
 
00:54:05.750 --> 00:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
a set of tests
 
00:54:08.950 --> 00:54:08.960 align:start position:0%
that you feel would be
 
00:54:12.150 --> 00:54:12.160 align:start position:0%
very beneficial to the state
 
00:54:15.190 --> 00:54:15.200 align:start position:0%
and allow these
 
00:54:18.230 --> 00:54:18.240 align:start position:0%
charities that
 
00:54:21.670 --> 00:54:21.680 align:start position:0%
would fit the waiver if
 
00:54:24.549 --> 00:54:24.559 align:start position:0%
they pass these tests i know i looked at
 
00:54:25.430 --> 00:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
the book
 
00:54:29.750 --> 00:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
and it is a book it's a huge book
 
00:54:32.950 --> 00:54:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:36.150 --> 00:54:36.160 align:start position:0%
if we put a bill in that went through
 
00:54:41.270 --> 00:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
every 51z we have a separate journal
 
00:54:44.630 --> 00:54:44.640 align:start position:0%
just for that so
 
00:54:47.990 --> 00:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
what we do need is to have
 
00:54:50.950 --> 00:54:50.960 align:start position:0%
something that covers specific cases and
 
00:54:52.230 --> 00:54:52.240 align:start position:0%
you brought out some
 
00:54:55.030 --> 00:54:55.040 align:start position:0%
good points that they had to the new
 
00:54:55.040 --> 00:54:58.150 align:start position:0%
good points that they had to the new
hampshire

00:54:58.150 --> 00:54:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:02.069 --> 00:55:02.079 align:start position:0%
organization benefit new hampshire
 
00:55:04.950 --> 00:55:04.960 align:start position:0%
charitable things and that sort of thing
 
00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:06.230 align:start position:0%
charitable things and that sort of thing
so

00:55:06.230 --> 00:55:06.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:55:08.870 --> 00:55:08.880 align:start position:0%
maybe you could put out some uh
 
00:55:08.880 --> 00:55:10.390 align:start position:0%
maybe you could put out some uh
guidelines

00:55:10.390 --> 00:55:10.400 align:start position:0%
guidelines
 
00:55:12.950 --> 00:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
that could be good to consider for next
 
00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:14.309 align:start position:0%
that could be good to consider for next
week

00:55:14.309 --> 00:55:14.319 align:start position:0%
week
 
00:55:17.670 --> 00:55:17.680 align:start position:0%
i will do my best to try to add
 
00:55:22.309 --> 00:55:22.319 align:start position:0%
to that um discussion i'm not sure that
 
00:55:26.710 --> 00:55:26.720 align:start position:0%
um you know that's that's a pretty large
 
00:55:31.190 --> 00:55:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:33.589 --> 00:55:33.599 align:start position:0%
just from just from my you know attorney
 
00:55:33.599 --> 00:55:34.230 align:start position:0%
just from just from my you know attorney
brain

00:55:34.230 --> 00:55:34.240 align:start position:0%
brain
 
00:55:36.309 --> 00:55:36.319 align:start position:0%
that i occasionally use when i sit in my
 
00:55:37.670 --> 00:55:37.680 align:start position:0%
representative's chair
 
00:55:40.710 --> 00:55:40.720 align:start position:0%
is just it's very difficult to try to
 
00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:41.829 align:start position:0%
is just it's very difficult to try to
prevent

00:55:41.829 --> 00:55:41.839 align:start position:0%
prevent
 
00:55:44.390 --> 00:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
you know any loophole around the system
 
00:55:44.870 --> 00:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
and i
 
00:55:46.630 --> 00:55:46.640 align:start position:0%
that is our job is to try to think
 
00:55:49.589 --> 00:55:49.599 align:start position:0%
through these scenarios
 
00:55:52.309 --> 00:55:52.319 align:start position:0%
something perfect we can we can probably
 
00:55:53.349 --> 00:55:53.359 align:start position:0%
improve the
 
00:55:54.789 --> 00:55:54.799 align:start position:0%
not only the amendment but the bill
 
00:55:57.910 --> 00:55:57.920 align:start position:0%
itself i'm sure with a few ideas
 
00:56:01.510 --> 00:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
fine if you could do that though really
 
00:56:03.910 --> 00:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
i think make more people comfortable
 
00:56:05.750 --> 00:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
about this
 
00:56:08.710 --> 00:56:08.720 align:start position:0%
on representative major can i uh just
 
00:56:08.720 --> 00:56:09.589 align:start position:0%
on representative major can i uh just
ask

00:56:09.589 --> 00:56:09.599 align:start position:0%
ask
 
00:56:12.789 --> 00:56:12.799 align:start position:0%
representative heckin phillips another
 
00:56:12.799 --> 00:56:13.750 align:start position:0%
representative heckin phillips another
question

00:56:13.750 --> 00:56:13.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:56:16.870 --> 00:56:16.880 align:start position:0%
about this from the beginning of what
 
00:56:18.470 --> 00:56:18.480 align:start position:0%
she was talking about before we
 
00:56:22.069 --> 00:56:22.079 align:start position:0%
give this one up okay uh
 
00:56:24.870 --> 00:56:24.880 align:start position:0%
romney has had his hand up i know he's
 
00:56:28.150 --> 00:56:28.160 align:start position:0%
going to a different thing i think
 
00:56:31.430 --> 00:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
norma representative can go first before
 
00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:32.950 align:start position:0%
norma representative can go first before
me

00:56:32.950 --> 00:56:32.960 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:56:36.390 --> 00:56:36.400 align:start position:0%
thank you on it's about c4s
 
00:56:39.589 --> 00:56:39.599 align:start position:0%
i know c4 is fairly well all the ones i
 
00:56:39.599 --> 00:56:39.990 align:start position:0%
i know c4 is fairly well all the ones i
know

00:56:39.990 --> 00:56:40.000 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:56:42.069 --> 00:56:42.079 align:start position:0%
are politic for political lobbying
 
00:56:43.589 --> 00:56:43.599 align:start position:0%
purposes and political
 
00:56:47.270 --> 00:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
no for political election purposes
 
00:56:49.430 --> 00:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
yeah i don't know how they got there
 
00:56:50.710 --> 00:56:50.720 align:start position:0%
from the definition
 
00:56:53.990 --> 00:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
that you you uh read us but
 
00:56:56.549 --> 00:56:56.559 align:start position:0%
that's what they are i'm sure the nra
 
00:56:56.559 --> 00:56:57.030 align:start position:0%
that's what they are i'm sure the nra
has

00:56:57.030 --> 00:56:57.040 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:56:59.510 --> 00:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
won the family plan uh planned
 
00:57:01.030 --> 00:57:01.040 align:start position:0%
parenthood has one
 
00:57:04.950 --> 00:57:04.960 align:start position:0%
uh the aclu has one yeah that was not
 
00:57:07.270 --> 00:57:07.280 align:start position:0%
for election it's for lobbying but
 
00:57:10.950 --> 00:57:10.960 align:start position:0%
so information that representative
 
00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:13.349 align:start position:0%
so information that representative
phillips

00:57:13.349 --> 00:57:13.359 align:start position:0%
phillips
 
00:57:16.150 --> 00:57:16.160 align:start position:0%
can put together as part of the
 
00:57:16.160 --> 00:57:20.789 align:start position:0%
can put together as part of the
requirements

00:57:20.789 --> 00:57:20.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:22.710 --> 00:57:22.720 align:start position:0%
and that would be more like a broad
 
00:57:24.829 --> 00:57:24.839 align:start position:0%
brush if they meet these requirements
 
00:57:27.670 --> 00:57:27.680 align:start position:0%
then we stand a better chance of getting
 
00:57:30.870 --> 00:57:30.880 align:start position:0%
later but
 
00:57:32.390 --> 00:57:32.400 align:start position:0%
i mean we could make this very
 
00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:35.109 align:start position:0%
i mean we could make this very
complicated

00:57:35.109 --> 00:57:35.119 align:start position:0%
complicated
 
00:57:40.309 --> 00:57:40.319 align:start position:0%
but let's make it a good bill
 
00:57:43.829 --> 00:57:43.839 align:start position:0%
yeah now representative brown
 
00:57:46.549 --> 00:57:46.559 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um let's let's first
 
00:57:47.910 --> 00:57:47.920 align:start position:0%
recognize that the bill
 
00:57:49.670 --> 00:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
forget about the amendment that i just
 
00:57:51.430 --> 00:57:51.440 align:start position:0%
uh provided
 
00:57:55.270 --> 00:57:55.280 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with these 501c
 
00:57:58.390 --> 00:57:58.400 align:start position:0%
the six of them all it does the reason
 
00:57:59.990 --> 00:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
they're bolded is because they're
 
00:58:01.190 --> 00:58:01.200 align:start position:0%
crossed out of
 
00:58:03.910 --> 00:58:03.920 align:start position:0%
two other sections and put into two
 
00:58:06.069 --> 00:58:06.079 align:start position:0%
other sections so
 
00:58:07.990 --> 00:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
the the sponsor of the bill wasn't
 
00:58:11.270 --> 00:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
adding additional 501cs or whatever
 
00:58:14.230 --> 00:58:14.240 align:start position:0%
it was just a a replacement of the
 
00:58:17.109 --> 00:58:17.119 align:start position:0%
language within the statute
 
00:58:20.630 --> 00:58:20.640 align:start position:0%
so in my 11 years on ways of means
 
00:58:23.589 --> 00:58:23.599 align:start position:0%
we've never tackled this question of are
 
00:58:25.349 --> 00:58:25.359 align:start position:0%
these the appropriate
 
00:58:28.390 --> 00:58:28.400 align:start position:0%
uh codes to be using
 
00:58:30.630 --> 00:58:30.640 align:start position:0%
and and and charitable gaming's only
 
00:58:32.630 --> 00:58:32.640 align:start position:0%
been around a decade and a half
 
00:58:36.309 --> 00:58:36.319 align:start position:0%
so and probably bingo longer but
 
00:58:39.990 --> 00:58:40.000 align:start position:0%
uh so i think it's a major task for us
 
00:58:40.950 --> 00:58:40.960 align:start position:0%
to take on
 
00:58:43.829 --> 00:58:43.839 align:start position:0%
at this point in time uh to to look at
 
00:58:45.589 --> 00:58:45.599 align:start position:0%
all these codes
 
00:58:48.870 --> 00:58:48.880 align:start position:0%
so i uh uh in fairness i i think
 
00:58:51.910 --> 00:58:51.920 align:start position:0%
either we didn't retain the bill
 
00:58:55.670 --> 00:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
if we really want to study these codes
 
00:58:57.829 --> 00:58:57.839 align:start position:0%
to see where i would start with to say
 
00:59:01.030 --> 00:59:01.040 align:start position:0%
okay which of the current charities
 
00:59:03.750 --> 00:59:03.760 align:start position:0%
are falling to which of the i'm curious
 
00:59:03.760 --> 00:59:04.069 align:start position:0%
are falling to which of the i'm curious
about

00:59:04.069 --> 00:59:04.079 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:59:07.510 --> 00:59:07.520 align:start position:0%
that which ones are 501 uh c3s and which
 
00:59:09.750 --> 00:59:09.760 align:start position:0%
ones are 50c10s
 
00:59:11.990 --> 00:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
and we may flush something out there
 
00:59:13.990 --> 00:59:14.000 align:start position:0%
that no no 503
 
00:59:18.150 --> 00:59:18.160 align:start position:0%
10 actually uses this uh
 
00:59:21.750 --> 00:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
uh or is is the current
 
00:59:25.030 --> 00:59:25.040 align:start position:0%
user so this is a big question this is
 
00:59:26.950 --> 00:59:26.960 align:start position:0%
beyond this bill
 
00:59:29.670 --> 00:59:29.680 align:start position:0%
to me representative uh hack and
 
00:59:29.680 --> 00:59:30.630 align:start position:0%
to me representative uh hack and
phillips

00:59:30.630 --> 00:59:30.640 align:start position:0%
phillips
 
00:59:33.829 --> 00:59:33.839 align:start position:0%
i think you're right on beam though uh
 
00:59:35.430 --> 00:59:35.440 align:start position:0%
more from the perspective that we
 
00:59:37.910 --> 00:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
haven't looked at this in years
 
00:59:41.750 --> 00:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh so i think
 
00:59:44.230 --> 00:59:44.240 align:start position:0%
my my opinion is that either we pass it
 
00:59:45.430 --> 00:59:45.440 align:start position:0%
the way it is
 
00:59:48.390 --> 00:59:48.400 align:start position:0%
and then file a bill to to study this or
 
00:59:49.829 --> 00:59:49.839 align:start position:0%
study it as a committee
 
00:59:51.910 --> 00:59:51.920 align:start position:0%
or just to retain it if we're willing to
 
00:59:53.349 --> 00:59:53.359 align:start position:0%
all put the work in
 
00:59:56.549 --> 00:59:56.559 align:start position:0%
in the late summer and in the fall to
 
00:59:58.710 --> 00:59:58.720 align:start position:0%
really look at all these codes to see
 
01:00:00.069 --> 01:00:00.079 align:start position:0%
what's in them
 
01:00:02.950 --> 01:00:02.960 align:start position:0%
so that's that's just my opinion on that
 
01:00:05.510 --> 01:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
i think we're taking on a big bite here
 
01:00:08.789 --> 01:00:08.799 align:start position:0%
uh to really try to amend
 
01:00:11.430 --> 01:00:11.440 align:start position:0%
all of these codes or add some or delete
 
01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:12.390 align:start position:0%
all of these codes or add some or delete
some

01:00:12.390 --> 01:00:12.400 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:00:14.789 --> 01:00:14.799 align:start position:0%
uh within the framework of this bill
 
01:00:15.829 --> 01:00:15.839 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:00:19.270 --> 01:00:19.280 align:start position:0%
and i would recommend that
 
01:00:22.390 --> 01:00:22.400 align:start position:0%
if we have there should be caucuses
 
01:00:26.870 --> 01:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
of both parties before next tuesday
 
01:00:29.750 --> 01:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
this is one thing to be considered as
 
01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:30.720 align:start position:0%
far as
 
01:00:35.109 --> 01:00:35.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:37.990 --> 01:00:38.000 align:start position:0%
the river to doing that but if you come
 
01:00:39.270 --> 01:00:39.280 align:start position:0%
up with
 
01:00:41.910 --> 01:00:41.920 align:start position:0%
it's possible and hopefully rips and
 
01:00:43.109 --> 01:00:43.119 align:start position:0%
hack and phillips
 
01:00:45.349 --> 01:00:45.359 align:start position:0%
come up with something that one of the
 
01:00:47.990 --> 01:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
things that we're concerned with
 
01:00:50.789 --> 01:00:50.799 align:start position:0%
not referring to a 501c but these are
 
01:00:52.789 --> 01:00:52.799 align:start position:0%
the things we're concerned with
 
01:00:56.470 --> 01:00:56.480 align:start position:0%
that the money doesn't go to a
 
01:00:58.549 --> 01:00:58.559 align:start position:0%
lobbying and doesn't go to these other
 
01:01:00.150 --> 01:01:00.160 align:start position:0%
things without
 
01:01:04.309 --> 01:01:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:08.150 --> 01:01:08.160 align:start position:0%
and so we need to make the determination
 
01:01:10.069 --> 01:01:10.079 align:start position:0%
do we want to pass the bill as it is do
 
01:01:11.270 --> 01:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
we want to retain it
 
01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:14.640 align:start position:0%
do we want to amend it with
 
01:01:17.750 --> 01:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
some guidelines
 
01:01:21.270 --> 01:01:21.280 align:start position:0%
and so uh but we need to we need to make
 
01:01:25.750 --> 01:01:25.760 align:start position:0%
up our mind to do something with it
 
01:01:29.270 --> 01:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
uh representative ames
 
01:01:32.390 --> 01:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
followed by representing newly actually
 
01:01:36.150 --> 01:01:36.160 align:start position:0%
i just want to say that i i i agree with
 
01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:37.349 align:start position:0%
i just want to say that i i i agree with
the

01:01:37.349 --> 01:01:37.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:01:39.870 --> 01:01:39.880 align:start position:0%
direction we seem to be going um
 
01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:41.190 align:start position:0%
direction we seem to be going um
[Music]

01:01:41.190 --> 01:01:41.200 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:01:43.750 --> 01:01:43.760 align:start position:0%
i i want to note that there is uh we're
 
01:01:44.630 --> 01:01:44.640 align:start position:0%
very close
 
01:01:47.829 --> 01:01:47.839 align:start position:0%
to seeing the enactment of uh either
 
01:01:50.309 --> 01:01:50.319 align:start position:0%
house bill 565 which
 
01:01:53.270 --> 01:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
i sponsored or it's equivalent that's
 
01:01:55.270 --> 01:01:55.280 align:start position:0%
come over to us from the senate as part
 
01:01:57.109 --> 01:01:57.119 align:start position:0%
of an omnibus bill
 
01:02:00.549 --> 01:02:00.559 align:start position:0%
um and that bill will be
 
01:02:02.950 --> 01:02:02.960 align:start position:0%
uh establishing establishing a committee
 
01:02:04.549 --> 01:02:04.559 align:start position:0%
to study charitable gaming
 
01:02:08.150 --> 01:02:08.160 align:start position:0%
and certainly this this uh
 
01:02:11.510 --> 01:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
sort of this uh core concern about what
 
01:02:12.870 --> 01:02:12.880 align:start position:0%
is a
 
01:02:15.670 --> 01:02:15.680 align:start position:0%
a charitable organization should be part
 
01:02:16.630 --> 01:02:16.640 align:start position:0%
of that study
 
01:02:19.589 --> 01:02:19.599 align:start position:0%
and we could make sure that it is uh i
 
01:02:22.230 --> 01:02:22.240 align:start position:0%
do think it's a complicated endeavor
 
01:02:25.510 --> 01:02:25.520 align:start position:0%
when we get beyond the few sort of
 
01:02:28.789 --> 01:02:28.799 align:start position:0%
general words that can be said i i think
 
01:02:30.470 --> 01:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
that on this bill
 
01:02:32.230 --> 01:02:32.240 align:start position:0%
we should take a hard look to see if
 
01:02:34.069 --> 01:02:34.079 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a
 
01:02:38.870 --> 01:02:38.880 align:start position:0%
fix that addresses this waiver question
 
01:02:42.150 --> 01:02:42.160 align:start position:0%
and that doesn't get
 
01:02:44.710 --> 01:02:44.720 align:start position:0%
tangled up with the complexities too
 
01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:46.230 align:start position:0%
tangled up with the complexities too
much

01:02:46.230 --> 01:02:46.240 align:start position:0%
much
 
01:02:48.230 --> 01:02:48.240 align:start position:0%
maybe there is maybe there isn't but
 
01:02:50.230 --> 01:02:50.240 align:start position:0%
let's take a hard look at that
 
01:02:53.589 --> 01:02:53.599 align:start position:0%
and maybe we can act on the bill um but
 
01:02:56.549 --> 01:02:56.559 align:start position:0%
um i think there is a larger issue here
 
01:02:57.750 --> 01:02:57.760 align:start position:0%
that's really important
 
01:03:01.430 --> 01:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
and uh and that there's another vehicle
 
01:03:04.710 --> 01:03:04.720 align:start position:0%
available to us other than retaining and
 
01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:05.910 align:start position:0%
available to us other than retaining and
studying

01:03:05.910 --> 01:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
studying
 
01:03:09.829 --> 01:03:09.839 align:start position:0%
which has its d has its problems um
 
01:03:12.309 --> 01:03:12.319 align:start position:0%
so that's my contribution mr chair if i
 
01:03:13.670 --> 01:03:13.680 align:start position:0%
could just chime in real quick
 
01:03:16.309 --> 01:03:16.319 align:start position:0%
i'm cutting i know i actually had the
 
01:03:17.910 --> 01:03:17.920 align:start position:0%
same thought as representative
 
01:03:22.150 --> 01:03:22.160 align:start position:0%
ames did about this romney
 
01:03:24.390 --> 01:03:24.400 align:start position:0%
i had a question for representatives
 
01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:26.150 align:start position:0%
i had a question for representatives
okay

01:03:26.150 --> 01:03:26.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:03:28.870 --> 01:03:28.880 align:start position:0%
ruxin ames maybe you could work with
 
01:03:30.309 --> 01:03:30.319 align:start position:0%
representative hackens
 
01:03:34.549 --> 01:03:34.559 align:start position:0%
and see if there's some simple rules
 
01:03:39.029 --> 01:03:39.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:40.230 --> 01:03:40.240 align:start position:0%
rather than getting into the
 
01:03:42.470 --> 01:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
complexities of
 
01:03:45.589 --> 01:03:45.599 align:start position:0%
501 c 3 4 5 19
 
01:03:48.630 --> 01:03:48.640 align:start position:0%
et cetera yeah we'll talk okay
 
01:03:52.309 --> 01:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
thank you uh go ahead representative
 
01:03:55.670 --> 01:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
sarge no i'm sorry about that mr chair i
 
01:03:57.029 --> 01:03:57.039 align:start position:0%
i was just saying that i
 
01:03:59.109 --> 01:03:59.119 align:start position:0%
actually had the same thought about
 
01:04:00.549 --> 01:04:00.559 align:start position:0%
maybe wrapping this into the
 
01:04:03.750 --> 01:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
study committee with the senate so
 
01:04:06.470 --> 01:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
uh that may have some merits that's all
 
01:04:08.309 --> 01:04:08.319 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:04:10.829 --> 01:04:10.839 align:start position:0%
right before i go to the next one
 
01:04:10.839 --> 01:04:12.069 align:start position:0%
right before i go to the next one
representative

01:04:12.069 --> 01:04:12.079 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:04:15.349 --> 01:04:15.359 align:start position:0%
ames mentioned house bill 565
 
01:04:19.750 --> 01:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
and representative romney had
 
01:04:23.510 --> 01:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
jen duo side by side
 
01:04:27.029 --> 01:04:27.039 align:start position:0%
with one part of senate bill 100
 
01:04:28.630 --> 01:04:28.640 align:start position:0%
to see what was the difference between
 
01:04:30.549 --> 01:04:30.559 align:start position:0%
the two of them has that been
 
01:04:31.829 --> 01:04:31.839 align:start position:0%
distributed to
 
01:04:34.470 --> 01:04:34.480 align:start position:0%
committee members you know yes yes it
 
01:04:35.589 --> 01:04:35.599 align:start position:0%
should have been yes
 
01:04:42.150 --> 01:04:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:45.750 --> 01:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
thank you uh mr chair um representative
 
01:04:48.870 --> 01:04:48.880 align:start position:0%
hack and phillips spoke about um
 
01:04:51.670 --> 01:04:51.680 align:start position:0%
501 c8s and c10s those are two of which
 
01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:52.150 align:start position:0%
501 c8s and c10s those are two of which
i

01:04:52.150 --> 01:04:52.160 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:04:55.589 --> 01:04:55.599 align:start position:0%
i know and and i work with 501ch 501c8s
 
01:04:55.599 --> 01:04:56.150 align:start position:0%
i know and and i work with 501ch 501c8s
just

01:04:56.150 --> 01:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:04:58.470 --> 01:04:58.480 align:start position:0%
to give you some idea would be things
 
01:04:59.990 --> 01:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
like the knights of columbus the knights
 
01:05:01.029 --> 01:05:01.039 align:start position:0%
of pitheos
 
01:05:03.990 --> 01:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
the knights of uh there's a couple other
 
01:05:05.670 --> 01:05:05.680 align:start position:0%
nights that aren't affiliated with
 
01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:06.549 align:start position:0%
nights that aren't affiliated with
anything

01:05:06.549 --> 01:05:06.559 align:start position:0%
anything
 
01:05:09.589 --> 01:05:09.599 align:start position:0%
yeah odd fellows uh
 
01:05:12.630 --> 01:05:12.640 align:start position:0%
catholic uh foresters and foresters
 
01:05:14.069 --> 01:05:14.079 align:start position:0%
insurance companies
 
01:05:19.190 --> 01:05:19.200 align:start position:0%
i believe are all 501c8 whereas a 501c10
 
01:05:22.710 --> 01:05:22.720 align:start position:0%
is not basically uh carved out for the
 
01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:23.349 align:start position:0%
is not basically uh carved out for the
uh

01:05:23.349 --> 01:05:23.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:05:26.630 --> 01:05:26.640 align:start position:0%
masons alone as far as money is go going
 
01:05:28.390 --> 01:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
from um
 
01:05:31.430 --> 01:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
charitable uh gaming to uh
 
01:05:33.270 --> 01:05:33.280 align:start position:0%
the operation of the entity i think
 
01:05:34.950 --> 01:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
that's a good idea and i would be happy
 
01:05:36.549 --> 01:05:36.559 align:start position:0%
to work with representative ames and
 
01:05:39.109 --> 01:05:39.119 align:start position:0%
representative hacken phillips on that
 
01:05:39.119 --> 01:05:46.230 align:start position:0%
representative hacken phillips on that
good

01:05:46.230 --> 01:05:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:51.190 --> 01:05:51.200 align:start position:0%
rep thank you on representative abrami
 
01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:51.589 align:start position:0%
rep thank you on representative abrami
said

01:05:51.589 --> 01:05:51.599 align:start position:0%
said
 
01:05:55.630 --> 01:05:55.640 align:start position:0%
something about on this was just
 
01:05:58.470 --> 01:05:58.480 align:start position:0%
codifying this language is just
 
01:05:58.480 --> 01:05:59.430 align:start position:0%
codifying this language is just
codifying

01:05:59.430 --> 01:05:59.440 align:start position:0%
codifying
 
01:06:03.109 --> 01:06:03.119 align:start position:0%
what i wasn't sure what what is already
 
01:06:03.990 --> 01:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
being done
 
01:06:07.190 --> 01:06:07.200 align:start position:0%
without legislation or
 
01:06:11.670 --> 01:06:11.680 align:start position:0%
is maybe found in the bingo code
 
01:06:14.950 --> 01:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
where i thought that this was
 
01:06:17.990 --> 01:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
expanding on that
 
01:06:21.190 --> 01:06:21.200 align:start position:0%
we were now just with c3s but
 
01:06:24.630 --> 01:06:24.640 align:start position:0%
but on can we get clarification
 
01:06:27.910 --> 01:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
from lottery as to whether this language
 
01:06:28.950 --> 01:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
exists somewhere
 
01:06:31.829 --> 01:06:31.839 align:start position:0%
else or whether it's in your rules or or
 
01:06:31.839 --> 01:06:33.029 align:start position:0%
else or whether it's in your rules or or
whatever

01:06:33.029 --> 01:06:33.039 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
01:06:35.829 --> 01:06:35.839 align:start position:0%
thank you um can i can i respond to that
 
01:06:36.789 --> 01:06:36.799 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
01:06:39.109 --> 01:06:39.119 align:start position:0%
go ahead and representative go to page
 
01:06:40.230 --> 01:06:40.240 align:start position:0%
two of the bill
 
01:06:43.270 --> 01:06:43.280 align:start position:0%
if you have that in front of you i need
 
01:06:45.109 --> 01:06:45.119 align:start position:0%
mine's uh
 
01:06:48.150 --> 01:06:48.160 align:start position:0%
lines four
 
01:06:51.589 --> 01:06:51.599 align:start position:0%
well basically uh four that see it's
 
01:06:53.190 --> 01:06:53.200 align:start position:0%
crossed out
 
01:06:55.430 --> 01:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
all the codes there and if you go down
 
01:06:57.589 --> 01:06:57.599 align:start position:0%
to line 18
 
01:07:00.470 --> 01:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
the same thing all they did was they
 
01:07:01.750 --> 01:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
moved they
 
01:07:03.670 --> 01:07:03.680 align:start position:0%
basically did some housekeeping on the
 
01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:04.950 align:start position:0%
basically did some housekeeping on the
statute

01:07:04.950 --> 01:07:04.960 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:07:07.349 --> 01:07:07.359 align:start position:0%
and put those back in because there's
 
01:07:10.069 --> 01:07:10.079 align:start position:0%
two spots where they got added back in
 
01:07:13.990 --> 01:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
on on page one of the bill
 
01:07:18.150 --> 01:07:18.160 align:start position:0%
on line 15 and page
 
01:07:21.430 --> 01:07:21.440 align:start position:0%
two uh line
 
01:07:25.029 --> 01:07:25.039 align:start position:0%
nine and line eight and nine
 
01:07:28.309 --> 01:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
so thank you i just noticed that
 
01:07:30.549 --> 01:07:30.559 align:start position:0%
right so it isn't like they these were
 
01:07:31.829 --> 01:07:31.839 align:start position:0%
new these are the
 
01:07:33.270 --> 01:07:33.280 align:start position:0%
these are the codes we've been using
 
01:07:34.870 --> 01:07:34.880 align:start position:0%
since the beginning of time
 
01:07:37.750 --> 01:07:37.760 align:start position:0%
is my point and that's why i said do we
 
01:07:38.950 --> 01:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
really want to take this on
 
01:07:41.430 --> 01:07:41.440 align:start position:0%
at this moment uh we didn't it isn't
 
01:07:43.029 --> 01:07:43.039 align:start position:0%
like the bill added other
 
01:07:47.190 --> 01:07:47.200 align:start position:0%
other uh uh 501c codes to deal with or
 
01:07:50.950 --> 01:07:50.960 align:start position:0%
or or to agree that takes them away
 
01:07:52.630 --> 01:07:52.640 align:start position:0%
uh if we want to make that into that
 
01:07:55.029 --> 01:07:55.039 align:start position:0%
then that's going to take some time
 
01:07:57.510 --> 01:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
is my only concern and if we had another
 
01:07:58.950 --> 01:07:58.960 align:start position:0%
month maybe we
 
01:08:00.789 --> 01:08:00.799 align:start position:0%
we could we could do that but you could
 
01:08:02.390 --> 01:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
take a crack at it
 
01:08:05.430 --> 01:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
and see how we do but uh and again like
 
01:08:06.390 --> 01:08:06.400 align:start position:0%
i said earlier
 
01:08:09.430 --> 01:08:09.440 align:start position:0%
i agree with representative ames that
 
01:08:10.789 --> 01:08:10.799 align:start position:0%
be the appropriate place for it would be
 
01:08:12.950 --> 01:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
within that study study committee
 
01:08:16.229 --> 01:08:16.239 align:start position:0%

the next bill is hospit i mean senate
 
01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:46.189 align:start position:0%
the next bill is hospit i mean senate
bill

01:08:46.189 --> 01:08:46.199 align:start position:0%

01:08:51.269 --> 01:08:51.279 align:start position:0%
139-fn relative to bingo dates
 
01:08:52.950 --> 01:08:52.960 align:start position:0%
let's see if this is going to be a
 
01:08:58.149 --> 01:08:58.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:01.189 --> 01:09:01.199 align:start position:0%
uh anybody have any
 
01:09:04.470 --> 01:09:04.480 align:start position:0%
comments questions on
 
01:09:07.990 --> 01:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:12.870 --> 01:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
well representative
 
01:09:14.709 --> 01:09:14.719 align:start position:0%
of romney followed by representative
 
01:09:14.719 --> 01:09:17.110 align:start position:0%
of romney followed by representative
elmi

01:09:17.110 --> 01:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
elmi
 
01:09:20.950 --> 01:09:20.960 align:start position:0%
the the real question is um
 
01:09:23.749 --> 01:09:23.759 align:start position:0%
i think senator senator avar did this
 
01:09:24.470 --> 01:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
for one
 
01:09:28.149 --> 01:09:28.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:30.470 --> 01:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
and i've had some conversations with
 
01:09:33.110 --> 01:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
some others since the bill was heard
 
01:09:36.870 --> 01:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
and that not all the not all the bingo
 
01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:38.070 align:start position:0%
and that not all the not all the bingo
halls

01:09:38.070 --> 01:09:38.080 align:start position:0%
halls
 
01:09:42.470 --> 01:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
are well again they didn't testify but
 
01:09:44.390 --> 01:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
uh but it's my understanding that not
 
01:09:47.510 --> 01:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
all the bingo halls agree with this
 
01:09:51.749 --> 01:09:51.759 align:start position:0%
uh there could be a compromise
 
01:09:56.229 --> 01:09:56.239 align:start position:0%
where we not you know because
 
01:09:58.630 --> 01:09:58.640 align:start position:0%
one question i had asked was will this
 
01:09:59.830 --> 01:09:59.840 align:start position:0%
force some charities
 
01:10:04.070 --> 01:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
out of uh because they basically
 
01:10:07.510 --> 01:10:07.520 align:start position:0%
um you know if we we
 
01:10:11.350 --> 01:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
give more more dates to some charities
 
01:10:13.830 --> 01:10:13.840 align:start position:0%
that would mean that other charities
 
01:10:15.189 --> 01:10:15.199 align:start position:0%
would would have less
 
01:10:17.750 --> 01:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
dates assuming that all the dates were
 
01:10:19.669 --> 01:10:19.679 align:start position:0%
taken now we heard testimony that
 
01:10:21.430 --> 01:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
in this one facility that not all the
 
01:10:23.430 --> 01:10:23.440 align:start position:0%
dates were being taken
 
01:10:30.149 --> 01:10:30.159 align:start position:0%
but i i've i've heard that from
 
01:10:32.149 --> 01:10:32.159 align:start position:0%
what's his name uh michael mclaughlin
 
01:10:35.030 --> 01:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
who we hear from a lot on our committee
 
01:10:37.430 --> 01:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
that he knows of at least four that have
 
01:10:38.790 --> 01:10:38.800 align:start position:0%
waiting lists
 
01:10:42.229 --> 01:10:42.239 align:start position:0%
for for this so uh so
 
01:10:43.990 --> 01:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
it seems like this bill is is trying to
 
01:10:45.830 --> 01:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
solve a problem for one
 
01:10:48.229 --> 01:10:48.239 align:start position:0%
one establishment and potentially could
 
01:10:49.270 --> 01:10:49.280 align:start position:0%
be creating
 
01:10:51.750 --> 01:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
a problem for other establishments that
 
01:10:53.350 --> 01:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
are bingo halls
 
01:10:56.229 --> 01:10:56.239 align:start position:0%
so that that's i love how to speak but
 
01:10:56.239 --> 01:10:57.110 align:start position:0%
so that that's i love how to speak but
uh

01:10:57.110 --> 01:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:10:59.510 --> 01:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
that's my only concern right now and and
 
01:11:01.030 --> 01:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
i i have to think about
 
01:11:02.950 --> 01:11:02.960 align:start position:0%
maybe amending this but i don't have a
 
01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:04.470 align:start position:0%
maybe amending this but i don't have a
specific

01:11:04.470 --> 01:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
specific
 
01:11:07.189 --> 01:11:07.199 align:start position:0%
thing that would would allow for
 
01:11:08.470 --> 01:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
possibly uh
 
01:11:11.590 --> 01:11:11.600 align:start position:0%
three or four extra days uh a period
 
01:11:14.709 --> 01:11:14.719 align:start position:0%
uh if if someone wants but i i
 
01:11:17.030 --> 01:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
i don't know um i just concerned that
 
01:11:18.390 --> 01:11:18.400 align:start position:0%
there might be
 
01:11:20.070 --> 01:11:20.080 align:start position:0%
uh we may doing hard to some other
 
01:11:21.830 --> 01:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
charities here
 
01:11:25.270 --> 01:11:25.280 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you uh representative
 
01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:27.189 align:start position:0%

01:11:36.709 --> 01:11:36.719 align:start position:0%
i really do not understand why we are
 
01:11:36.719 --> 01:11:38.149 align:start position:0%
i really do not understand why we are
still

01:11:38.149 --> 01:11:38.159 align:start position:0%
still
 
01:11:41.750 --> 01:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
trying to regulate the game dates for
 
01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:44.310 align:start position:0%
trying to regulate the game dates for
bingo

01:11:44.310 --> 01:11:44.320 align:start position:0%
bingo
 
01:11:47.510 --> 01:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
bingo as far as i can tell
 
01:11:49.350 --> 01:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
we haven't had an update on bingo for
 
01:11:50.950 --> 01:11:50.960 align:start position:0%
quite a long time now
 
01:11:54.709 --> 01:11:54.719 align:start position:0%
on how i don't know how many bingo halls
 
01:11:58.630 --> 01:11:58.640 align:start position:0%
are left that are just doing bingo on
 
01:12:01.830 --> 01:12:01.840 align:start position:0%
they how many
 
01:12:04.950 --> 01:12:04.960 align:start position:0%
um charities are interested in working
 
01:12:06.310 --> 01:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
with them is versus
 
01:12:09.590 --> 01:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
the much more profitable on
 
01:12:13.590 --> 01:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming ones and um
 
01:12:17.270 --> 01:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
if we just as it is it doesn't read
 
01:12:21.030 --> 01:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
you have to give 16 game dates to one
 
01:12:22.630 --> 01:12:22.640 align:start position:0%
charity it only
 
01:12:25.510 --> 01:12:25.520 align:start position:0%
reads you have to give you can give up
 
01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:26.070 align:start position:0%
reads you have to give you can give up
to

01:12:26.070 --> 01:12:26.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:12:29.430 --> 01:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
that many uh
 
01:12:32.870 --> 01:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
which but if we just
 
01:12:35.350 --> 01:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
i don't know if we just excised all of
 
01:12:36.310 --> 01:12:36.320 align:start position:0%
the reference
 
01:12:39.270 --> 01:12:39.280 align:start position:0%
to how many games you can give to
 
01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:41.350 align:start position:0%
to how many games you can give to
whoever

01:12:41.350 --> 01:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
whoever
 
01:12:44.149 --> 01:12:44.159 align:start position:0%
whether the halls could then just figure
 
01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
out how many charities they wanted to
 
01:12:52.310 --> 01:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:56.790 --> 01:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
okay is there any organization of bingo
 
01:12:57.910 --> 01:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
halls that
 
01:13:02.310 --> 01:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
we could talk to uh john do you have a
 
01:13:06.070 --> 01:13:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:08.709 --> 01:13:08.719 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if mr newman also
 
01:13:10.470 --> 01:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
represents some bingo halls or some
 
01:13:13.830 --> 01:13:13.840 align:start position:0%

01:13:16.310 --> 01:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
uh bingo and uh games of chance
 
01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:17.350 align:start position:0%

01:13:22.149 --> 01:13:22.159 align:start position:0%
questions regarding bingo i would defer
 
01:13:25.189 --> 01:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
to valerie king who's also on the zoom
 
01:13:27.910 --> 01:13:27.920 align:start position:0%

01:14:05.189 --> 01:14:05.199 align:start position:0%
the question had to do is uh
 
01:14:08.470 --> 01:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
a couple parts is how many bengal halls
 
01:14:08.870 --> 01:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
are there
 
01:14:13.110 --> 01:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:17.189 --> 01:14:17.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:22.149 --> 01:14:22.159 align:start position:0%
oh answer that one first i
 
01:14:25.030 --> 01:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
there are approximately 15 licensed
 
01:14:26.550 --> 01:14:26.560 align:start position:0%
commercial bingo halls
 
01:14:29.110 --> 01:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire still some of them
 
01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:30.870 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire still some of them
operate

01:14:30.870 --> 01:14:30.880 align:start position:0%
operate
 
01:14:34.070 --> 01:14:34.080 align:start position:0%
larger venues than others but there are
 
01:14:40.870 --> 01:14:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:46.470 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:14:46.470 --> 01:14:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:49.830 --> 01:14:49.840 align:start position:0%
yes thank you on it
 
01:14:52.709 --> 01:14:52.719 align:start position:0%
it was what would it do to the current
 
01:14:52.719 --> 01:14:53.590 align:start position:0%
it was what would it do to the current
situation

01:14:53.590 --> 01:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
situation
 
01:14:57.590 --> 01:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
if we just removed all requirements
 
01:15:01.270 --> 01:15:01.280 align:start position:0%
as to how many game dates each charity
 
01:15:04.950 --> 01:15:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:08.630 --> 01:15:08.640 align:start position:0%
well i i don't i don't really have an
 
01:15:10.310 --> 01:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
answer for that um
 
01:15:14.149 --> 01:15:14.159 align:start position:0%
right now it's 10 we could open it up to
 
01:15:14.159 --> 01:15:14.550 align:start position:0%
right now it's 10 we could open it up to
more

01:15:14.550 --> 01:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:15:17.270 --> 01:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
i don't know that there would be a an
 
01:15:18.390 --> 01:15:18.400 align:start position:0%
effect or not i
 
01:15:20.229 --> 01:15:20.239 align:start position:0%
as you as you mentioned representative
 
01:15:21.750 --> 01:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
amy this
 
01:15:25.030 --> 01:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
bill wouldn't prevent the halls from
 
01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:26.070 align:start position:0%
bill wouldn't prevent the halls from
having

01:15:26.070 --> 01:15:26.080 align:start position:0%
having
 
01:15:27.990 --> 01:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
keeping it to 10 game dates for
 
01:15:31.270 --> 01:15:31.280 align:start position:0%
charities or even less
 
01:15:33.350 --> 01:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
it would just allow that they could go
 
01:15:35.030 --> 01:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
up to 16.
 
01:15:37.590 --> 01:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
as far as the agency is concerned that
 
01:15:39.350 --> 01:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be a heavy lift for us we just
 
01:15:39.910 --> 01:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
have to
 
01:15:42.870 --> 01:15:42.880 align:start position:0%
um increase the number of game dates
 
01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:43.750 align:start position:0%
um increase the number of game dates
allowed

01:15:43.750 --> 01:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
allowed
 
01:15:46.709 --> 01:15:46.719 align:start position:0%
um it would require them to pay for more
 
01:15:47.590 --> 01:15:47.600 align:start position:0%
per month
 
01:15:51.270 --> 01:15:51.280 align:start position:0%
which could be a financial cost up front
 
01:15:53.430 --> 01:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
it's only 25 dollars per game date but
 
01:15:54.790 --> 01:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
if they were to do
 
01:15:56.550 --> 01:15:56.560 align:start position:0%
every day of the month that could be
 
01:15:58.709 --> 01:15:58.719 align:start position:0%
expensive but other than that i
 
01:16:04.149 --> 01:16:04.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:06.550 --> 01:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
okay any further questions uh for
 
01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:07.270 align:start position:0%
okay any further questions uh for
valerie

01:16:07.270 --> 01:16:07.280 align:start position:0%
valerie
 
01:16:09.910 --> 01:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
uh representative brownlee yeah uh
 
01:16:12.229 --> 01:16:12.239 align:start position:0%
thanks mr chair thanks uh miss king
 
01:16:15.830 --> 01:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
so uh how many of the charitable gaming
 
01:16:19.110 --> 01:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
locations also offer bingo i
 
01:16:20.950 --> 01:16:20.960 align:start position:0%
i i think it's five or six in my head
 
01:16:22.870 --> 01:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
but uh do you have that up
 
01:16:25.270 --> 01:16:25.280 align:start position:0%
and is that is that above and beyond the
 
01:16:27.270 --> 01:16:27.280 align:start position:0%
15 that you mentioned
 
01:16:30.550 --> 01:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
no that they're included in the 15
 
01:16:34.470 --> 01:16:34.480 align:start position:0%
um and of those we have lakes region
 
01:16:36.470 --> 01:16:36.480 align:start position:0%
which does both games a chance and bingo
 
01:16:37.750 --> 01:16:37.760 align:start position:0%
lucky seven
 
01:16:40.950 --> 01:16:40.960 align:start position:0%
uh concord casino
 
01:16:46.310 --> 01:16:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:50.149 --> 01:16:50.159 align:start position:0%
lebanon poker room the manchester poker
 
01:16:50.159 --> 01:16:52.229 align:start position:0%
lebanon poker room the manchester poker
room

01:16:52.229 --> 01:16:52.239 align:start position:0%
room
 
01:16:54.229 --> 01:16:54.239 align:start position:0%
and i believe that's it so six of them
 
01:16:55.750 --> 01:16:55.760 align:start position:0%
six of the 15
 
01:16:59.030 --> 01:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
are also games of chance halls okay so
 
01:17:00.790 --> 01:17:00.800 align:start position:0%
they have both licenses
 
01:17:07.350 --> 01:17:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:12.390 --> 01:17:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:17.030 --> 01:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
saying none

hi this is mike from a bob eastwood
 
01:18:42.950 --> 01:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
representing community maintenance
 
01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:44.149 align:start position:0%
representing community maintenance
international

01:18:44.149 --> 01:18:44.159 align:start position:0%
international
 
01:18:47.590 --> 01:18:47.600 align:start position:0%
uh 139. uh
 
01:18:49.189 --> 01:18:49.199 align:start position:0%
i had some discussion with
 
01:18:51.910 --> 01:18:51.920 align:start position:0%
representative browning relatively the
 
01:18:55.270 --> 01:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
impact of the 16 states
 
01:18:58.550 --> 01:18:58.560 align:start position:0%
and to ohio which has a waiting list
 
01:19:00.950 --> 01:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
the possibility existed would actually
 
01:19:02.229 --> 01:19:02.239 align:start position:0%
eliminate charities
 
01:19:04.229 --> 01:19:04.239 align:start position:0%
as opposed to adding to them so i had to
 
01:19:05.430 --> 01:19:05.440 align:start position:0%
ask uh
 
01:19:08.390 --> 01:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
the thoughts together that maybe uh an
 
01:19:09.270 --> 01:19:09.280 align:start position:0%
option of
 
01:19:10.870 --> 01:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
three additional dates a month would be
 
01:19:12.310 --> 01:19:12.320 align:start position:0%
work workable
 
01:19:14.310 --> 01:19:14.320 align:start position:0%
and that the uh some of the bengals
 
01:19:15.510 --> 01:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
spartans testified
 
01:19:16.950 --> 01:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
relative to the fact that they run into
 
01:19:18.390 --> 01:19:18.400 align:start position:0%
some odd months and they'd like to have
 
01:19:19.990 --> 01:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
that extra day
 
01:19:22.630 --> 01:19:22.640 align:start position:0%
we don't see that a 60 increase in the
 
01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:23.669 align:start position:0%
we don't see that a 60 increase in the
dates

01:19:23.669 --> 01:19:23.679 align:start position:0%
dates
 
01:19:25.510 --> 01:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
is something that actually is uh going
 
01:19:27.110 --> 01:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
to be benefits uh
 
01:19:29.270 --> 01:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
particularly if there's a waiting list a
 
01:19:31.189 --> 01:19:31.199 align:start position:0%
high um
 
01:19:32.790 --> 01:19:32.800 align:start position:0%
performing charity may be able to force
 
01:19:34.630 --> 01:19:34.640 align:start position:0%
others out so that was the unintended
 
01:19:36.149 --> 01:19:36.159 align:start position:0%
consequence i had mentioned at the
 
01:19:36.159 --> 01:19:36.870 align:start position:0%
consequence i had mentioned at the
hearing

01:19:36.870 --> 01:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
01:19:39.669 --> 01:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
several weeks ago and while we recognize
 
01:19:40.790 --> 01:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
there are some charities
 
01:19:42.709 --> 01:19:42.719 align:start position:0%
and there are some halls where there are
 
01:19:44.630 --> 01:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
available dates i think a little more
 
01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:45.510 align:start position:0%
available dates i think a little more
control

01:19:45.510 --> 01:19:45.520 align:start position:0%
control
 
01:19:54.149 --> 01:19:54.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:59.350 --> 01:19:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:05.110 --> 01:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
can i ask representative romney
 
01:20:08.390 --> 01:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
mr mclaughlin um so
 
01:20:09.990 --> 01:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
what do you think of su representative
 
01:20:12.470 --> 01:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
almi's suggestion that we just do away
 
01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:15.830 align:start position:0%
almi's suggestion that we just do away
with

01:20:15.830 --> 01:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:17.510 --> 01:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
well i i think it's an interesting
 
01:20:19.350 --> 01:20:19.360 align:start position:0%
suggestion but i think that the
 
01:20:21.750 --> 01:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
control factor if i had a super charity
 
01:20:22.470 --> 01:20:22.480 align:start position:0%
if i could run
 
01:20:24.149 --> 01:20:24.159 align:start position:0%
30 days a month why would i want more
 
01:20:26.950 --> 01:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
than one that carryover coverall would
 
01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:27.750 align:start position:0%
than one that carryover coverall would
zoom

01:20:27.750 --> 01:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
zoom
 
01:20:31.270 --> 01:20:31.280 align:start position:0%
every night uh i i think the limitation
 
01:20:32.950 --> 01:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
of dates actually is the protection to
 
01:20:36.629 --> 01:20:36.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:44.830 --> 01:20:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:46.790 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:20:46.790 --> 01:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:20:50.870 --> 01:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
sorry on i i guess he answered why he
 
01:20:51.510 --> 01:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
thinks that
 
01:20:54.470 --> 01:20:54.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't trust the halls to do right by
 
01:20:55.510 --> 01:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
their charities
 
01:20:59.189 --> 01:20:59.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:00.709 --> 01:21:00.719 align:start position:0%
i trust the house to do right by their
 
01:21:00.719 --> 01:21:03.910 align:start position:0%
i trust the house to do right by their
owners

01:21:03.910 --> 01:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:08.060 --> 01:21:08.070 align:start position:0%

saying then i'm going to close the
 
01:21:40.550 --> 01:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:51.430 --> 01:21:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:07.910 --> 01:22:07.920 align:start position:0%

01:22:10.679 --> 01:22:12.070 align:start position:0%
i don't know why i got one of 103.
101-fn

01:22:12.070 --> 01:22:12.080 align:start position:0%
101-fn
 
01:22:14.390 --> 01:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
increase in the minimum gross business
 
01:22:15.510 --> 01:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
income required
 
01:22:20.629 --> 01:22:20.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:24.310 --> 01:22:24.320 align:start position:0%
then we have an amendment offered by
 
01:22:29.510 --> 01:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:33.270 --> 01:22:33.280 align:start position:0%
and before we get into that amendment
 
01:22:36.709 --> 01:22:36.719 align:start position:0%
it was a question that we asked
 
01:22:40.629 --> 01:22:40.639 align:start position:0%
of the dra the ira was asked
 
01:22:44.709 --> 01:22:44.719 align:start position:0%
what would the cost be
 
01:22:48.310 --> 01:22:48.320 align:start position:0%
rather than implementing 75
 
01:22:51.350 --> 01:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
000 as as the trigger
 
01:22:55.510 --> 01:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
but 85 and 100 000. and i believe
 
01:23:04.310 --> 01:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:06.870 --> 01:23:06.880 align:start position:0%
before we get into the right
 
01:23:08.470 --> 01:23:08.480 align:start position:0%
representation to go over
 
01:23:11.830 --> 01:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
the amendment and and represent nearly
 
01:23:13.590 --> 01:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
i'm going to have to drop off because
 
01:23:14.950 --> 01:23:14.960 align:start position:0%

hi representative sorry this is carolyn
 
01:24:26.149 --> 01:24:26.159 align:start position:0%
it took a minute for my
 
01:24:28.550 --> 01:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
screen to refresh when i got promoted
 
01:24:29.669 --> 01:24:29.679 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna let
 
01:24:32.390 --> 01:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
devin give you an explanation of what
 
01:24:33.350 --> 01:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
he's done
 
01:24:37.350 --> 01:24:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:39.189 --> 01:24:39.199 align:start position:0%
hello representatives this is devin
 
01:24:41.110 --> 01:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
roderick financial analyst department of
 
01:24:41.120 --> 01:24:42.470 align:start position:0%
roderick financial analyst department of
revenue

01:24:42.470 --> 01:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
01:24:45.189 --> 01:24:45.199 align:start position:0%
we took a look at the two additional um
 
01:24:47.189 --> 01:24:47.199 align:start position:0%
proposed thresholds amounts that we sent
 
01:24:48.149 --> 01:24:48.159 align:start position:0%
to you
 
01:24:50.470 --> 01:24:50.480 align:start position:0%
and we um we we applied the same
 
01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:51.270 align:start position:0%
and we um we we applied the same
analysis

01:24:51.270 --> 01:24:51.280 align:start position:0%
analysis
 
01:24:54.229 --> 01:24:54.239 align:start position:0%
for the original senate bill 101 which
 
01:24:55.189 --> 01:24:55.199 align:start position:0%
increased the
 
01:24:57.030 --> 01:24:57.040 align:start position:0%
gross business income threshold from
 
01:24:58.229 --> 01:24:58.239 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand
 
01:25:01.030 --> 01:25:01.040 align:start position:0%
to seventy five thousand and we applied
 
01:25:02.629 --> 01:25:02.639 align:start position:0%
that to tax year twenty eighteen
 
01:25:02.639 --> 01:25:04.149 align:start position:0%
that to tax year twenty eighteen
information

01:25:04.149 --> 01:25:04.159 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:25:06.149 --> 01:25:06.159 align:start position:0%
and we took a look at federal tax
 
01:25:08.070 --> 01:25:08.080 align:start position:0%
information in order to come up with
 
01:25:09.430 --> 01:25:09.440 align:start position:0%
the results that you see there in the
 
01:25:11.990 --> 01:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
chart um the number of taxpayers
 
01:25:14.390 --> 01:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
who filed tax year 2018 returns as you
 
01:25:15.750 --> 01:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
can see in each
 
01:25:17.669 --> 01:25:17.679 align:start position:0%
each row of that chart are the same
 
01:25:19.910 --> 01:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
that's using the same data
 
01:25:23.270 --> 01:25:23.280 align:start position:0%
so the original analysis for sb101
 
01:25:25.350 --> 01:25:25.360 align:start position:0%
moving that threshold to 75000 had an
 
01:25:27.270 --> 01:25:27.280 align:start position:0%
estimated impact
 
01:25:31.189 --> 01:25:31.199 align:start position:0%
of 1.5 million and affected
 
01:25:34.950 --> 01:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
essentially 660 taxpayers during that
 
01:25:36.550 --> 01:25:36.560 align:start position:0%
tax year
 
01:25:39.669 --> 01:25:39.679 align:start position:0%
if you increase it to 85 000
 
01:25:42.950 --> 01:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
it would essentially impact 896
 
01:25:45.110 --> 01:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
taxpayers who had liability during that
 
01:25:47.910 --> 01:25:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:51.350 --> 01:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
and the impact would be 2.1 million
 
01:25:53.189 --> 01:25:53.199 align:start position:0%
and with a hundred thousand the impact
 
01:25:55.430 --> 01:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
would be 2.9
 
01:26:00.390 --> 01:26:00.400 align:start position:0%
million impacting 1221 taxpayers who had
 
01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:02.229 align:start position:0%
million impacting 1221 taxpayers who had
liability

01:26:02.229 --> 01:26:02.239 align:start position:0%
liability
 
01:26:05.990 --> 01:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
so overall um in each instance you can
 
01:26:07.590 --> 01:26:07.600 align:start position:0%
see that rona said had zero
 
01:26:10.470 --> 01:26:10.480 align:start position:0%
bpt liability those were taxpayers that
 
01:26:11.910 --> 01:26:11.920 align:start position:0%
after everything said and done didn't
 
01:26:13.350 --> 01:26:13.360 align:start position:0%
actually owe any money to the department
 
01:26:14.870 --> 01:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
that year
 
01:26:16.550 --> 01:26:16.560 align:start position:0%
so we want to make sure we broke out who
 
01:26:17.990 --> 01:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
was actually and the number of
 
01:26:20.790 --> 01:26:20.800 align:start position:0%
taxpayers that were actually impacted
 
01:26:22.229 --> 01:26:22.239 align:start position:0%
and i'd be happy to answer any questions
 
01:26:23.030 --> 01:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
that you have
 
01:26:26.629 --> 01:26:26.639 align:start position:0%
okay thank you devon uh does anyone have
 
01:26:30.629 --> 01:26:30.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:34.229 --> 01:26:34.239 align:start position:0%
on mine fits within that i think i
 
01:26:35.510 --> 01:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to ask them
 
01:26:38.870 --> 01:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
if on i
 
01:26:42.669 --> 01:26:42.679 align:start position:0%
i looked at the inflation since
 
01:26:45.510 --> 01:26:45.520 align:start position:0%
1993 on
 
01:26:49.030 --> 01:26:49.040 align:start position:0%
to march to march of this year
 
01:26:52.470 --> 01:26:52.480 align:start position:0%
on it comes out to
 
01:26:57.590 --> 01:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
on the 50 000 changes to 92.2
 
01:27:01.750 --> 01:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
000. um and
 
01:27:05.550 --> 01:27:05.560 align:start position:0%
that is for for my
 
01:27:08.390 --> 01:27:08.400 align:start position:0%
interpretation of two data sets for
 
01:27:10.149 --> 01:27:10.159 align:start position:0%
northeast urban
 
01:27:14.030 --> 01:27:14.040 align:start position:0%
on for the national one it changes to
 
01:27:14.040 --> 01:27:15.910 align:start position:0%
on for the national one it changes to
91.7

01:27:15.910 --> 01:27:15.920 align:start position:0%
91.7
 
01:27:19.270 --> 01:27:19.280 align:start position:0%
thousand on
 
01:27:22.390 --> 01:27:22.400 align:start position:0%
if on in our
 
01:27:24.390 --> 01:27:24.400 align:start position:0%
in the amendment that representative
 
01:27:26.629 --> 01:27:26.639 align:start position:0%
ulri fashioned
 
01:27:29.990 --> 01:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
on there is uh
 
01:27:33.590 --> 01:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
he's put the hundred thousand but it
 
01:27:36.470 --> 01:27:36.480 align:start position:0%
we seem to be some at just about halfway
 
01:27:38.310 --> 01:27:38.320 align:start position:0%
between 85 and 100
 
01:27:40.390 --> 01:27:40.400 align:start position:0%
000 in terms of inflation since that
 
01:27:40.400 --> 01:27:41.669 align:start position:0%
000 in terms of inflation since that
time

01:27:41.669 --> 01:27:41.679 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:27:44.709 --> 01:27:44.719 align:start position:0%
and i was wondering if on devin had
 
01:27:47.590 --> 01:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
any thoughts about the way i calculated
 
01:27:49.270 --> 01:27:49.280 align:start position:0%
the northeast urban or
 
01:27:52.070 --> 01:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
well we could just say it was 92 000 if
 
01:27:55.430 --> 01:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
we were going to do inflation
 
01:27:57.430 --> 01:27:57.440 align:start position:0%
i don't have any questions about that
 
01:27:58.709 --> 01:27:58.719 align:start position:0%
because i haven't i haven't actually
 
01:27:58.719 --> 01:27:59.030 align:start position:0%
because i haven't i haven't actually
looked

01:27:59.030 --> 01:27:59.040 align:start position:0%
looked
 
01:28:00.709 --> 01:28:00.719 align:start position:0%
at myself the time frame that you
 
01:28:02.149 --> 01:28:02.159 align:start position:0%
mentioned um
 
01:28:05.830 --> 01:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
i would mention that the bet thresholds
 
01:28:07.430 --> 01:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
are adjusted by annually
 
01:28:09.189 --> 01:28:09.199 align:start position:0%
using i believe the data you just
 
01:28:11.590 --> 01:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned in northeast urban
 
01:28:15.910 --> 01:28:15.920 align:start position:0%
um and that's been in place since 2015 i
 
01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:16.870 align:start position:0%
um and that's been in place since 2015 i
believe

01:28:16.870 --> 01:28:16.880 align:start position:0%
believe
 
01:28:19.350 --> 01:28:19.360 align:start position:0%
so um i'd have to take a look at you
 
01:28:20.870 --> 01:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
know i trust the information you're
 
01:28:22.550 --> 01:28:22.560 align:start position:0%
saying represent elmi but i don't really
 
01:28:23.990 --> 01:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
have any questions about that at this
 
01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.790 align:start position:0%
have any questions about that at this
time

01:28:26.790 --> 01:28:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:29.990 --> 01:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
thank you i think it was passed in 2012
 
01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:30.310 align:start position:0%
thank you i think it was passed in 2012
but

01:28:30.310 --> 01:28:30.320 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:28:32.149 --> 01:28:32.159 align:start position:0%
15 may have been the first time you did
 
01:28:32.159 --> 01:28:34.470 align:start position:0%
15 may have been the first time you did
that

01:28:34.470 --> 01:28:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:37.910 --> 01:28:37.920 align:start position:0%
okay thank you devon um representative
 
01:28:37.920 --> 01:28:38.550 align:start position:0%
okay thank you devon um representative
rory

01:28:38.550 --> 01:28:38.560 align:start position:0%
rory
 
01:28:39.510 --> 01:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
if you could walk us through the
 
01:28:41.270 --> 01:28:41.280 align:start position:0%
amendment you have your hand up as well
 
01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:42.390 align:start position:0%
amendment you have your hand up as well
so

01:28:42.390 --> 01:28:42.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:28:45.270 --> 01:28:45.280 align:start position:0%
um but do you have a question of of uh
 
01:28:46.229 --> 01:28:46.239 align:start position:0%
devin or
 
01:28:48.950 --> 01:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
do you also no no not at all i was just
 
01:28:50.950 --> 01:28:50.960 align:start position:0%
uh looking at the uh
 
01:28:56.070 --> 01:28:56.080 align:start position:0%
um the figures here and the
 
01:28:58.229 --> 01:28:58.239 align:start position:0%
what's not accounted for in this is what
 
01:28:59.189 --> 01:28:59.199 align:start position:0%
susan or
 
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
representative almi had just stated
 
01:29:04.229 --> 01:29:04.239 align:start position:0%
regarding the rate of inflation
 
01:29:07.830 --> 01:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
and there's also uh a bit of a concern
 
01:29:10.149 --> 01:29:10.159 align:start position:0%
about the amount of money that is now
 
01:29:13.030 --> 01:29:13.040 align:start position:0%
floating around being spent everywhere
 
01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:13.669 align:start position:0%
floating around being spent everywhere
that

01:29:13.669 --> 01:29:13.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:29:16.870 --> 01:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
the dollar amount of uh three million
 
01:29:16.880 --> 01:29:17.430 align:start position:0%
the dollar amount of uh three million
dollars

01:29:17.430 --> 01:29:17.440 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:29:20.870 --> 01:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
at a hundred thousand is not going to be
 
01:29:20.880 --> 01:29:21.430 align:start position:0%
at a hundred thousand is not going to be
worth

01:29:21.430 --> 01:29:21.440 align:start position:0%
worth
 
01:29:23.990 --> 01:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
three million dollars uh because of the
 
01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:24.790 align:start position:0%
three million dollars uh because of the
uh

01:29:24.790 --> 01:29:24.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:29:27.590 --> 01:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
uh devaluation of the value of the
 
01:29:28.950 --> 01:29:28.960 align:start position:0%
dollar by
 
01:29:31.030 --> 01:29:31.040 align:start position:0%
six trillion dollars being pumped into
 
01:29:32.149 --> 01:29:32.159 align:start position:0%
the economy
 
01:29:35.590 --> 01:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
from different places uh let me see
 
01:29:38.070 --> 01:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
you've all got a copy of the uh
 
01:29:42.229 --> 01:29:42.239 align:start position:0%
uh amendment in front of you correct
 
01:29:46.709 --> 01:29:46.719 align:start position:0%
uh they were sent out to everybody yeah
 
01:29:48.790 --> 01:29:48.800 align:start position:0%
so let's just take a look at that hang
 
01:29:53.669 --> 01:29:53.679 align:start position:0%
on a second before i pull it up
 
01:29:57.830 --> 01:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:59.990 --> 01:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
all it does is change the threshold to
 
01:30:01.750 --> 01:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
100 000
 
01:30:04.870 --> 01:30:04.880 align:start position:0%
and then uses existing language and
 
01:30:08.709 --> 01:30:08.719 align:start position:0%
other law to put an inflation bait
 
01:30:11.910 --> 01:30:11.920 align:start position:0%
rate in now if we want to
 
01:30:15.270 --> 01:30:15.280 align:start position:0%
leave it at 75 or increase it to 85
 
01:30:18.709 --> 01:30:18.719 align:start position:0%
um that's immaterial uh
 
01:30:21.590 --> 01:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
the the key factor on this is adding and
 
01:30:21.600 --> 01:30:21.910 align:start position:0%
the the key factor on this is adding and
uh

01:30:21.910 --> 01:30:21.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:30:23.910 --> 01:30:23.920 align:start position:0%
i think uh representing lonely will
 
01:30:26.870 --> 01:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
agree would be adding a two-year review
 
01:30:29.110 --> 01:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
to take a look at what the inflation
 
01:30:29.120 --> 01:30:29.990 align:start position:0%
to take a look at what the inflation
value

01:30:29.990 --> 01:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
value
 
01:30:34.070 --> 01:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
uh is based upon the northeast region
 
01:30:37.669 --> 01:30:37.679 align:start position:0%
consumers northeast region digest
 
01:30:41.189 --> 01:30:41.199 align:start position:0%
index excuse me so that you
 
01:30:43.750 --> 01:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
have that based in law and we don't have
 
01:30:44.790 --> 01:30:44.800 align:start position:0%
to review this
 
01:30:48.149 --> 01:30:48.159 align:start position:0%
every few years and it gives our
 
01:30:51.350 --> 01:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
small businesses which you know 100 one
 
01:30:52.629 --> 01:30:52.639 align:start position:0%
plumber may
 
01:30:54.709 --> 01:30:54.719 align:start position:0%
with an individual shop earning a
 
01:30:56.550 --> 01:30:56.560 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars
 
01:30:58.470 --> 01:30:58.480 align:start position:0%
if he has to pay taxes on a hundred
 
01:31:00.149 --> 01:31:00.159 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars he's not
 
01:31:03.030 --> 01:31:03.040 align:start position:0%
particularly earning a hundred thousand
 
01:31:03.040 --> 01:31:03.990 align:start position:0%
particularly earning a hundred thousand
dollars

01:31:03.990 --> 01:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:31:07.830 --> 01:31:07.840 align:start position:0%
uh and you know that's a
 
01:31:10.390 --> 01:31:10.400 align:start position:0%
a reasonable rate of return for one
 
01:31:13.189 --> 01:31:13.199 align:start position:0%
particular license now if it's a shop
 
01:31:15.669 --> 01:31:15.679 align:start position:0%
like uh the guy that sells all the hats
 
01:31:17.430 --> 01:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
there on radio that you hear all the
 
01:31:17.440 --> 01:31:18.310 align:start position:0%
there on radio that you hear all the
time

01:31:18.310 --> 01:31:18.320 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:31:22.629 --> 01:31:22.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:26.070 --> 01:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
um a lot more uh revenue coming in
 
01:31:29.110 --> 01:31:29.120 align:start position:0%
and he's not a one-man shop the idea of
 
01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:29.430 align:start position:0%
and he's not a one-man shop the idea of
this

01:31:29.430 --> 01:31:29.440 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:31:31.830 --> 01:31:31.840 align:start position:0%
is to make sure that the one-man shop
 
01:31:33.750 --> 01:31:33.760 align:start position:0%
the smaller businesses
 
01:31:35.750 --> 01:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
have a break from having to file
 
01:31:37.830 --> 01:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
unnecessary paperwork
 
01:31:41.189 --> 01:31:41.199 align:start position:0%
that's it any questions uh yeah i do
 
01:31:44.149 --> 01:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
and then uh and then represent southward
 
01:31:44.709 --> 01:31:44.719 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
01:31:46.149 --> 01:31:46.159 align:start position:0%
i just want to make sure this is
 
01:31:47.750 --> 01:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
identical to the bet
 
01:31:50.229 --> 01:31:50.239 align:start position:0%
language that's what i asked them to put
 
01:31:51.030 --> 01:31:51.040 align:start position:0%
in and
 
01:31:54.470 --> 01:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
uh they you know i i trust uh
 
01:31:58.470 --> 01:31:58.480 align:start position:0%
aols to um you know or whatever it is on
 
01:32:01.990 --> 01:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
legislative services to do their um
 
01:32:03.830 --> 01:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
and the other other concern is that it's
 
01:32:05.220 --> 01:32:05.230 align:start position:0%
in sync with that the
 
01:32:05.230 --> 01:32:06.550 align:start position:0%
in sync with that the
[Music]

01:32:06.550 --> 01:32:06.560 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:32:09.830 --> 01:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
uh it's on the same year that the the
 
01:32:11.510 --> 01:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
index is applied every two years and
 
01:32:13.830 --> 01:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
that those those two dates are in sync
 
01:32:15.990 --> 01:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
in terms of i'll i'll check without um
 
01:32:17.350 --> 01:32:17.360 align:start position:0%
like thank you on that
 
01:32:20.550 --> 01:32:20.560 align:start position:0%
uh representative romney we'll um
 
01:32:21.990 --> 01:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
we'll check and make sure but i told
 
01:32:23.750 --> 01:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
them to do that when they put it in here
 
01:32:24.870 --> 01:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
so it may be a
 
01:32:27.910 --> 01:32:27.920 align:start position:0%
small change on that thank you
 
01:32:30.790 --> 01:32:30.800 align:start position:0%
representative southworth ah thank you
 
01:32:32.229 --> 01:32:32.239 align:start position:0%
mine is a comment
 
01:32:34.550 --> 01:32:34.560 align:start position:0%
although i never like to lose revenue
 
01:32:36.790 --> 01:32:36.800 align:start position:0%
this does seem like a fair amendment
 
01:32:39.669 --> 01:32:39.679 align:start position:0%
and i do think within the near future
 
01:32:41.910 --> 01:32:41.920 align:start position:0%
we'll be at 100 000 being fair
 
01:32:44.950 --> 01:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
anyway so i'm you know especially with
 
01:32:46.870 --> 01:32:46.880 align:start position:0%
some of susan's numbers and things
 
01:32:47.990 --> 01:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
i think we're going to be there
 
01:32:50.310 --> 01:32:50.320 align:start position:0%
eventually and i do think it is
 
01:32:51.990 --> 01:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
something that is fair
 
01:32:56.629 --> 01:32:56.639 align:start position:0%
thank you representative amy
 
01:33:00.229 --> 01:33:00.239 align:start position:0%
thank you um i i've got two things now
 
01:33:03.910 --> 01:33:03.920 align:start position:0%
um the first one is is if we started a
 
01:33:04.950 --> 01:33:04.960 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand
 
01:33:07.990 --> 01:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
now on and inflation does
 
01:33:11.430 --> 01:33:11.440 align:start position:0%
increase uh quite a bit then that will
 
01:33:11.440 --> 01:33:11.910 align:start position:0%
increase uh quite a bit then that will
be

01:33:11.910 --> 01:33:11.920 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:33:16.149 --> 01:33:16.159 align:start position:0%
exploding i'm uh faster than
 
01:33:19.350 --> 01:33:19.360 align:start position:0%
than otherwise i'd rather go with the 92
 
01:33:21.270 --> 01:33:21.280 align:start position:0%
i know it's a strange number
 
01:33:24.550 --> 01:33:24.560 align:start position:0%
but on also i think we can get uh
 
01:33:28.310 --> 01:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
dra devin or someone to to tell us
 
01:33:31.270 --> 01:33:31.280 align:start position:0%
if it's the exact same language i'm
 
01:33:32.229 --> 01:33:32.239 align:start position:0%
pretty sure
 
01:33:36.149 --> 01:33:36.159 align:start position:0%
it is um i put that
 
01:33:39.669 --> 01:33:39.679 align:start position:0%
in the bill that was passing
 
01:33:42.709 --> 01:33:42.719 align:start position:0%
in 2012
 
01:33:45.750 --> 01:33:45.760 align:start position:0%
basically because it is extremely
 
01:33:47.590 --> 01:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
painful when you have to
 
01:33:50.950 --> 01:33:50.960 align:start position:0%
increase after 10 years or 20 years
 
01:33:53.990 --> 01:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
on on the floor and
 
01:33:55.990 --> 01:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
you lose a lot more revenue all of a
 
01:33:57.510 --> 01:33:57.520 align:start position:0%
sudden and you haven't been used to
 
01:33:59.189 --> 01:33:59.199 align:start position:0%
doing that
 
01:34:02.790 --> 01:34:02.800 align:start position:0%
so in in addition it is much better for
 
01:34:03.590 --> 01:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
the businesses
 
01:34:06.310 --> 01:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
because it's painful for them to get
 
01:34:06.320 --> 01:34:07.189 align:start position:0%
because it's painful for them to get
inflated

01:34:07.189 --> 01:34:07.199 align:start position:0%
inflated
 
01:34:11.189 --> 01:34:11.199 align:start position:0%
into to a category
 
01:34:14.470 --> 01:34:14.480 align:start position:0%
uh year by year waiting for us to change
 
01:34:14.480 --> 01:34:15.669 align:start position:0%
uh year by year waiting for us to change
things

01:34:15.669 --> 01:34:15.679 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:34:19.510 --> 01:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
so um my other my only other
 
01:34:23.110 --> 01:34:23.120 align:start position:0%
comment was that on
 
01:34:26.709 --> 01:34:26.719 align:start position:0%
there is a request in the
 
01:34:29.750 --> 01:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
quick guide to change the
 
01:34:32.870 --> 01:34:32.880 align:start position:0%
applicability date
 
01:34:34.390 --> 01:34:34.400 align:start position:0%
and i think that ought to be in the
 
01:34:35.990 --> 01:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
amendment on
 
01:34:39.430 --> 01:34:39.440 align:start position:0%
change to periods for taxable periods
 
01:34:40.310 --> 01:34:40.320 align:start position:0%
ending on
 
01:34:44.149 --> 01:34:44.159 align:start position:0%
or after december 31 2022
 
01:34:46.229 --> 01:34:46.239 align:start position:0%
to ensure that the proposed change
 
01:34:46.239 --> 01:34:47.510 align:start position:0%
to ensure that the proposed change
impacts

01:34:47.510 --> 01:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
impacts
 
01:34:50.709 --> 01:34:50.719 align:start position:0%
uh all taxpayers fairly
 
01:34:54.390 --> 01:34:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:56.709 --> 01:34:56.719 align:start position:0%
so i think that we ought to include that
 
01:34:57.910 --> 01:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
in the amendment
 
01:35:01.109 --> 01:35:01.119 align:start position:0%
huh all right so i i think that's a good
 
01:35:01.990 --> 01:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
idea then if
 
01:35:04.070 --> 01:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
uh does anybody from the dra just want
 
01:35:05.669 --> 01:35:05.679 align:start position:0%
to comment on that
 
01:35:07.990 --> 01:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
suggestion yes representative we'd be
 
01:35:09.590 --> 01:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
happy to review the amendment
 
01:35:11.350 --> 01:35:11.360 align:start position:0%
and um our group will take a look at it
 
01:35:12.870 --> 01:35:12.880 align:start position:0%
and get back to you with any
 
01:35:14.550 --> 01:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
comments or questions on the wording of
 
01:35:16.950 --> 01:35:16.960 align:start position:0%
it and i'll jump in devin
 
01:35:19.830 --> 01:35:19.840 align:start position:0%
um because i think what you're asking is
 
01:35:22.310 --> 01:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
for us to comment on that uh requested
 
01:35:22.320 --> 01:35:22.790 align:start position:0%
for us to comment on that uh requested
change

01:35:22.790 --> 01:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
change
 
01:35:25.990 --> 01:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
is that right yes um so this really the
 
01:35:27.510 --> 01:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
the change that we requested would
 
01:35:28.470 --> 01:35:28.480 align:start position:0%
really impact
 
01:35:31.350 --> 01:35:31.360 align:start position:0%
a taxpayer that has a short period
 
01:35:31.360 --> 01:35:33.109 align:start position:0%
a taxpayer that has a short period
return

01:35:33.109 --> 01:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
return
 
01:35:37.189 --> 01:35:37.199 align:start position:0%
meaning a tax year that ends
 
01:35:40.870 --> 01:35:40.880 align:start position:0%
before a full 12 months because of
 
01:35:44.229 --> 01:35:44.239 align:start position:0%
when we're able to create our forms
 
01:35:46.229 --> 01:35:46.239 align:start position:0%
if the taxpayer had a short return our
 
01:35:48.390 --> 01:35:48.400 align:start position:0%
forms wouldn't properly reflect the
 
01:35:48.400 --> 01:35:49.109 align:start position:0%
forms wouldn't properly reflect the
changes

01:35:49.109 --> 01:35:49.119 align:start position:0%
changes
 
01:35:52.229 --> 01:35:52.239 align:start position:0%
changed threshold um with the current
 
01:35:55.669 --> 01:35:55.679 align:start position:0%
due date and so having um i'm sorry
 
01:35:56.870 --> 01:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
applicability date so
 
01:35:58.870 --> 01:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
changing the applicability date would
 
01:36:00.950 --> 01:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
ensure that you know every possible
 
01:36:02.310 --> 01:36:02.320 align:start position:0%
permutation of
 
01:36:05.750 --> 01:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
tax year would be properly
 
01:36:08.830 --> 01:36:08.840 align:start position:0%
reflected on the return a taxpayer would
 
01:36:08.840 --> 01:36:10.390 align:start position:0%
reflected on the return a taxpayer would
use

01:36:10.390 --> 01:36:10.400 align:start position:0%
use
 
01:36:12.550 --> 01:36:12.560 align:start position:0%
uh that makes sense to me uh does
 
01:36:13.910 --> 01:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
anybody have any
 
01:36:17.109 --> 01:36:17.119 align:start position:0%
problem with ms lear's uh
 
01:36:20.550 --> 01:36:20.560 align:start position:0%
suggestion and if not uh represent
 
01:36:22.310 --> 01:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
almi it sounds like you should amend
 
01:36:24.070 --> 01:36:24.080 align:start position:0%
your amendment to
 
01:36:27.990 --> 01:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
include that right and uh representative
 
01:36:30.229 --> 01:36:30.239 align:start position:0%
representative i'm not sure who's in
 
01:36:33.030 --> 01:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
charge of this amendment
 
01:36:36.310 --> 01:36:36.320 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry uh it doesn't make any
 
01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:36.870 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry uh it doesn't make any
difference

01:36:36.870 --> 01:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
difference
 
01:36:39.590 --> 01:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
but susan on because she brought it up
 
01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:40.070 align:start position:0%
but susan on because she brought it up
and

01:36:40.070 --> 01:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:36:41.910 --> 01:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
if she wants to take credit that's fine
 
01:36:43.430 --> 01:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
i see material
 
01:36:46.470 --> 01:36:46.480 align:start position:0%
uh i have a couple questions real quick
 
01:36:46.480 --> 01:36:46.950 align:start position:0%
uh i have a couple questions real quick
uh

01:36:46.950 --> 01:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:36:49.270 --> 01:36:49.280 align:start position:0%
is everyone comfortable with a hot one
 
01:36:51.669 --> 01:36:51.679 align:start position:0%
uh 100
 
01:36:54.310 --> 01:36:54.320 align:start position:0%
uh no representative schamberg i think
 
01:36:54.320 --> 01:36:55.109 align:start position:0%
uh no representative schamberg i think
92

01:36:55.109 --> 01:36:55.119 align:start position:0%
92
 
01:36:57.510 --> 01:36:57.520 align:start position:0%
susan has suggested it's a good starting
 
01:36:57.520 --> 01:36:59.830 align:start position:0%
susan has suggested it's a good starting
spot

01:36:59.830 --> 01:36:59.840 align:start position:0%
spot
 
01:37:02.470 --> 01:37:02.480 align:start position:0%
it gives us room to get to 100 000 in
 
01:37:06.629 --> 01:37:06.639 align:start position:0%
three years
 
01:37:09.669 --> 01:37:09.679 align:start position:0%
i i know real quick
 
01:37:12.229 --> 01:37:12.239 align:start position:0%
uh i i know the chair wasn't comfortable
 
01:37:13.750 --> 01:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
with going the full hundred
 
01:37:16.390 --> 01:37:16.400 align:start position:0%
uh in my conversation with him so
 
01:37:20.550 --> 01:37:20.560 align:start position:0%
perhaps the 92 would help be helpful
 
01:37:22.629 --> 01:37:22.639 align:start position:0%
you may want to have uh jordan you may
 
01:37:24.229 --> 01:37:24.239 align:start position:0%
want to have two amendments one with the
 
01:37:26.550 --> 01:37:26.560 align:start position:0%
92 and one with the
 
01:37:30.629 --> 01:37:30.639 align:start position:0%
100 and then we can just
 
01:37:33.030 --> 01:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
what the votes are yeah and what's the
 
01:37:34.629 --> 01:37:34.639 align:start position:0%
applicable date on that
 
01:37:37.990 --> 01:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
again would be this uh
 
01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:41.030 align:start position:0%
again would be this uh
carolyn

01:37:41.030 --> 01:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:41.040 --> 01:37:44.070 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:37:44.070 --> 01:37:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:45.669 --> 01:37:45.679 align:start position:0%
yeah i don't have my quick guide here
 
01:37:47.270 --> 01:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
i'm looking for it i
 
01:37:49.270 --> 01:37:49.280 align:start position:0%
i can't find it would you like me to
 
01:37:50.709 --> 01:37:50.719 align:start position:0%
email it to you representative would
 
01:37:51.990 --> 01:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
that be easier
 
01:37:54.790 --> 01:37:54.800 align:start position:0%
yes please thank you you're welcome no i
 
01:37:55.270 --> 01:37:55.280 align:start position:0%
got it
 
01:37:58.870 --> 01:37:58.880 align:start position:0%
okay all right uh let's see
 
01:38:02.709 --> 01:38:02.719 align:start position:0%
uh representative um geneviean
 
01:38:04.870 --> 01:38:04.880 align:start position:0%
and then followed by uh representative
 
01:38:04.880 --> 01:38:06.790 align:start position:0%
and then followed by uh representative
um

01:38:06.790 --> 01:38:06.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:11.590 --> 01:38:11.600 align:start position:0%
is that southworth or is that tom
 
01:38:14.870 --> 01:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
amber huh bamberg
 
01:38:18.310 --> 01:38:18.320 align:start position:0%
chamber okay so i'll take down my hand
 
01:38:22.470 --> 01:38:22.480 align:start position:0%
oh okay so representative uh janae again
 
01:38:24.709 --> 01:38:24.719 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh this is just a
 
01:38:26.709 --> 01:38:26.719 align:start position:0%
general question for dra
 
01:38:29.750 --> 01:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
um i just want to compare it let's let's
 
01:38:29.760 --> 01:38:29.990 align:start position:0%
um i just want to compare it let's let's
say

01:38:29.990 --> 01:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:38:31.990 --> 01:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
the the uh deduction was a hundred
 
01:38:33.990 --> 01:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
thousand uh or the the
 
01:38:36.470 --> 01:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
threshold was a hundred thousand um
 
01:38:38.790 --> 01:38:38.800 align:start position:0%
therefore a business who grosses uh
 
01:38:40.390 --> 01:38:40.400 align:start position:0%
less than a hundred thousand doesn't
 
01:38:42.790 --> 01:38:42.800 align:start position:0%
file um a return
 
01:38:45.030 --> 01:38:45.040 align:start position:0%
if a business makes a hundred thousand
 
01:38:46.470 --> 01:38:46.480 align:start position:0%
or grosses a hundred thousand
 
01:38:49.189 --> 01:38:49.199 align:start position:0%
and ten dollars and let's say they they
 
01:38:49.199 --> 01:38:49.510 align:start position:0%
and ten dollars and let's say they they
net

01:38:49.510 --> 01:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
net
 
01:38:52.070 --> 01:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
thirty thousand but the business that
 
01:38:53.430 --> 01:38:53.440 align:start position:0%
grossed a hundred thousand that didn't
 
01:38:55.430 --> 01:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
have to file also net thirty thousand
 
01:38:56.790 --> 01:38:56.800 align:start position:0%
does that mean the business
 
01:38:58.310 --> 01:38:58.320 align:start position:0%
that grossed a hundred thousand doesn't
 
01:38:59.990 --> 01:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
pay any taxes but the business
 
01:39:02.390 --> 01:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
grows to hundred thousand and ten pays
 
01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:04.709 align:start position:0%
grows to hundred thousand and ten pays
taxes

01:39:04.709 --> 01:39:04.719 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
01:39:06.950 --> 01:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
that's correct um it's really the
 
01:39:08.709 --> 01:39:08.719 align:start position:0%
difference between a filing
 
01:39:11.830 --> 01:39:11.840 align:start position:0%
threshold versus an exemption so for
 
01:39:13.590 --> 01:39:13.600 align:start position:0%
example under the interest and dividends
 
01:39:15.550 --> 01:39:15.560 align:start position:0%
tax the first
 
01:39:18.390 --> 01:39:18.400 align:start position:0%
2400 is wholly exempt
 
01:39:21.669 --> 01:39:21.679 align:start position:0%
whether you make 2401
 
01:39:25.109 --> 01:39:25.119 align:start position:0%
in interest or a million in interest
 
01:39:28.229 --> 01:39:28.239 align:start position:0%
the first 2400 is exempt but with a
 
01:39:28.239 --> 01:39:29.510 align:start position:0%
the first 2400 is exempt but with a
threshold

01:39:29.510 --> 01:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
threshold
 
01:39:32.629 --> 01:39:32.639 align:start position:0%
once you trip that threshold
 
01:39:36.870 --> 01:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
everything is taxable back to dollar one
 
01:39:38.870 --> 01:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
so it almost it almost gives a business
 
01:39:40.790 --> 01:39:40.800 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry follow-up
 
01:39:42.870 --> 01:39:42.880 align:start position:0%
um it almost gives a business an
 
01:39:43.830 --> 01:39:43.840 align:start position:0%
incentive to
 
01:39:45.990 --> 01:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
i mean if they're close to try to keep
 
01:39:47.910 --> 01:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
it below that because it's it almost
 
01:39:49.350 --> 01:39:49.360 align:start position:0%
creates a
 
01:39:51.830 --> 01:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
unfair scenario where and this is that's
 
01:39:53.510 --> 01:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
why this is just a general question in
 
01:39:54.870 --> 01:39:54.880 align:start position:0%
general i'm just trying to think if you
 
01:39:56.950 --> 01:39:56.960 align:start position:0%
grossed 101
 
01:40:01.430 --> 01:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
you know 101 000 you could be paying
 
01:40:03.910 --> 01:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
you know 7.7 percent of let's say a 30
 
01:40:03.920 --> 01:40:05.109 align:start position:0%
you know 7.7 percent of let's say a 30
000

01:40:05.109 --> 01:40:05.119 align:start position:0%
000
 
01:40:07.669 --> 01:40:07.679 align:start position:0%
net but the one that grows you know less
 
01:40:09.030 --> 01:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
than a hundred thousand
 
01:40:12.310 --> 01:40:12.320 align:start position:0%
didn't pay anything but i guess that's
 
01:40:14.149 --> 01:40:14.159 align:start position:0%
i mean that that's a maybe a discussion
 
01:40:16.470 --> 01:40:16.480 align:start position:0%
for a future day
 
01:40:19.030 --> 01:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for that it's good insight um
 
01:40:20.550 --> 01:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
then that that would be a major
 
01:40:23.350 --> 01:40:23.360 align:start position:0%
change in philosophy i guess that would
 
01:40:23.360 --> 01:40:23.990 align:start position:0%
change in philosophy i guess that would
be

01:40:23.990 --> 01:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:40:26.229 --> 01:40:26.239 align:start position:0%
take us a while to work through i think
 
01:40:27.430 --> 01:40:27.440 align:start position:0%
so right
 
01:40:30.870 --> 01:40:30.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative thank you
 
01:40:33.510 --> 01:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
on this is a problem with thresholds
 
01:40:33.520 --> 01:40:33.990 align:start position:0%
on this is a problem with thresholds
that

01:40:33.990 --> 01:40:34.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:40:37.229 --> 01:40:37.239 align:start position:0%
on i've been having to deal with since
 
01:40:39.990 --> 01:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
1999 when we were working on education
 
01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:40.950 align:start position:0%
1999 when we were working on education
funding

01:40:40.950 --> 01:40:40.960 align:start position:0%
funding
 
01:40:44.790 --> 01:40:44.800 align:start position:0%
um it's on the only alternative to that
 
01:40:48.149 --> 01:40:48.159 align:start position:0%
is a cascading one where you have
 
01:40:52.550 --> 01:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
one uh one rule for the people
 
01:40:56.550 --> 01:40:56.560 align:start position:0%
that are between 80 and 85 and another
 
01:40:58.950 --> 01:40:58.960 align:start position:0%
for 85 to 90 and so on
 
01:41:02.629 --> 01:41:02.639 align:start position:0%
all the way up and uh that it's
 
01:41:04.629 --> 01:41:04.639 align:start position:0%
more complicated than anyone wants to
 
01:41:06.310 --> 01:41:06.320 align:start position:0%
deal with
 
01:41:09.270 --> 01:41:09.280 align:start position:0%
but it it does occur throughout
 
01:41:10.950 --> 01:41:10.960 align:start position:0%
legislation in
 
01:41:14.229 --> 01:41:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:19.189 --> 01:41:19.199 align:start position:0%
okay okay any other questions
 
01:41:22.229 --> 01:41:22.239 align:start position:0%
okay so uh to the dra
 
01:41:24.629 --> 01:41:24.639 align:start position:0%
uh devin you're going to do the
 
01:41:26.149 --> 01:41:26.159 align:start position:0%
calculation at the 92
 
01:41:29.430 --> 01:41:29.440 align:start position:0%
000 level uh get that to
 
01:41:32.790 --> 01:41:32.800 align:start position:0%
to us uh hopefully sometime this week
 
01:41:36.790 --> 01:41:36.800 align:start position:0%
uh in jordan you're going to um
 
01:41:39.030 --> 01:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
i would i would just create a uh a
 
01:41:40.149 --> 01:41:40.159 align:start position:0%
second amendment
 
01:41:42.790 --> 01:41:42.800 align:start position:0%
keep your first amendment live at the
 
01:41:44.709 --> 01:41:44.719 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand
 
01:41:48.070 --> 01:41:48.080 align:start position:0%
and then to create another one with the
 
01:41:51.590 --> 01:41:51.600 align:start position:0%
92 000 is that okay
 
01:41:53.350 --> 01:41:53.360 align:start position:0%
with you well actually we're going to
 
01:41:56.550 --> 01:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
have to modify them both to put the um
 
01:41:59.109 --> 01:41:59.119 align:start position:0%
the date in there the other question is
 
01:42:01.510 --> 01:42:01.520 align:start position:0%
could i ask dra if they could uh do an
 
01:42:01.520 --> 01:42:02.870 align:start position:0%
could i ask dra if they could uh do an
analysis

01:42:02.870 --> 01:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
analysis
 
01:42:09.750 --> 01:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:12.070 --> 01:42:12.080 align:start position:0%
that's totally fine yes representative
 
01:42:13.510 --> 01:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:42:18.149 --> 01:42:18.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:19.990 --> 01:42:20.000 align:start position:0%
okay with that we're going to move on
 
01:42:21.430 --> 01:42:21.440 align:start position:0%
then to the next
 
01:42:24.870 --> 01:42:24.880 align:start position:0%
build which is
 
01:42:28.390 --> 01:42:28.400 align:start position:0%

01:42:43.669 --> 01:42:43.679 align:start position:0%
um the chair doesn't have any comments
 
01:42:46.149 --> 01:42:46.159 align:start position:0%

01:42:46.159 --> 01:42:46.540 align:start position:0%
on this one
um

01:42:46.540 --> 01:42:46.550 align:start position:0%

01:42:49.750 --> 01:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:52.709 --> 01:42:52.719 align:start position:0%
yeah i had a comment um okay question
 
01:42:54.149 --> 01:42:54.159 align:start position:0%

01:42:56.790 --> 01:42:56.800 align:start position:0%
all right representative and rep senator
 
01:43:00.229 --> 01:43:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:02.629 --> 01:43:02.639 align:start position:0%
yeah sorry to break in uh it's just that
 
01:43:03.510 --> 01:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
uh my
 
01:43:06.950 --> 01:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
my notes indicate that uh uh we were
 
01:43:06.960 --> 01:43:08.229 align:start position:0%
my notes indicate that uh uh we were
expecting

01:43:08.229 --> 01:43:08.239 align:start position:0%
expecting
 
01:43:11.669 --> 01:43:11.679 align:start position:0%
uh an amendment uh
 
01:43:14.709 --> 01:43:14.719 align:start position:0%
by dra there's some issue
 
01:43:17.350 --> 01:43:17.360 align:start position:0%
technical issue with this i i just have
 
01:43:20.149 --> 01:43:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:21.669 --> 01:43:21.679 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to look at my notes here i
 
01:43:23.990 --> 01:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
don't see that but uh carolyn
 
01:43:27.189 --> 01:43:27.199 align:start position:0%
can you chime in please no i don't
 
01:43:28.790 --> 01:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
believe that there were any
 
01:43:32.550 --> 01:43:32.560 align:start position:0%
um technical issues with this one
 
01:43:34.790 --> 01:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
um i think what we had talked about with
 
01:43:34.800 --> 01:43:35.830 align:start position:0%
um i think what we had talked about with
you

01:43:35.830 --> 01:43:35.840 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:43:38.070 --> 01:43:38.080 align:start position:0%
was just our understanding of where this
 
01:43:40.149 --> 01:43:40.159 align:start position:0%
legislation is coming from
 
01:43:43.270 --> 01:43:43.280 align:start position:0%
and that it relates more to um or is
 
01:43:45.990 --> 01:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
more impactful in states with personal
 
01:43:47.430 --> 01:43:47.440 align:start position:0%
income taxes
 
01:43:49.510 --> 01:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
where businesses actually have to
 
01:43:49.520 --> 01:43:50.629 align:start position:0%
where businesses actually have to
register

01:43:50.629 --> 01:43:50.639 align:start position:0%
register
 
01:43:52.870 --> 01:43:52.880 align:start position:0%
with the department of revenue and
 
01:43:55.750 --> 01:43:55.760 align:start position:0%
orchestrate withholding
 
01:43:58.550 --> 01:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
for employees before they send them to
 
01:43:59.510 --> 01:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:44:00.950 --> 01:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
and i think here in new hampshire where
 
01:44:02.790 --> 01:44:02.800 align:start position:0%
there's no income tax and therefore no
 
01:44:04.390 --> 01:44:04.400 align:start position:0%
withholding requirements
 
01:44:07.430 --> 01:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
there's no real barrier to entry from
 
01:44:09.030 --> 01:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
our perspective
 
01:44:12.229 --> 01:44:12.239 align:start position:0%
it's really whether or not the um
 
01:44:14.149 --> 01:44:14.159 align:start position:0%
the subsequent activity in new hampshire
 
01:44:17.510 --> 01:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
results in a tax obligation or not
 
01:44:19.990 --> 01:44:20.000 align:start position:0%
yeah i think i think it was that review
 
01:44:21.590 --> 01:44:21.600 align:start position:0%
and input that we were looking for so
 
01:44:22.790 --> 01:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
that's fine
 
01:44:25.510 --> 01:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you um representative
 
01:44:25.520 --> 01:44:27.350 align:start position:0%
okay thank you um representative
spellsbury

01:44:27.350 --> 01:44:27.360 align:start position:0%
spellsbury
 
01:44:30.550 --> 01:44:30.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um yeah my note
 
01:44:30.560 --> 01:44:31.109 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um yeah my note
also

01:44:31.109 --> 01:44:31.119 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:44:33.350 --> 01:44:33.360 align:start position:0%
indicated apparently dira has an
 
01:44:34.149 --> 01:44:34.159 align:start position:0%
amendment but
 
01:44:38.870 --> 01:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
i didn't know what it was my question is
 
01:44:42.310 --> 01:44:42.320 align:start position:0%
the phrase upon request by which comes
 
01:44:42.320 --> 01:44:42.790 align:start position:0%
the phrase upon request by which comes
up

01:44:42.790 --> 01:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:44:45.750 --> 01:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
two thirds of the way down page two
 
01:44:48.229 --> 01:44:48.239 align:start position:0%
under notification
 
01:44:50.470 --> 01:44:50.480 align:start position:0%
and in the hearing i had asked the
 
01:44:51.350 --> 01:44:51.360 align:start position:0%
question and i
 
01:44:54.470 --> 01:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
i don't think i really understood
 
01:44:58.629 --> 01:44:58.639 align:start position:0%
any clear answer how is the secretary of
 
01:45:01.270 --> 01:45:01.280 align:start position:0%
state supposed to discern
 
01:45:05.109 --> 01:45:05.119 align:start position:0%
the presence of this emergency force
 
01:45:10.470 --> 01:45:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:14.470 --> 01:45:14.480 align:start position:0%
but before we get to the representative
 
01:45:17.669 --> 01:45:17.679 align:start position:0%
what line on page two are you on
 
01:45:21.830 --> 01:45:21.840 align:start position:0%
sure unfortunately i put off uh
 
01:45:25.910 --> 01:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
i found it thank you thank you
 
01:45:28.470 --> 01:45:28.480 align:start position:0%
yeah under this is under notification
 
01:45:29.109 --> 01:45:29.119 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:45:31.669 --> 01:45:31.679 align:start position:0%
it reads any out-of-state business that
 
01:45:32.550 --> 01:45:32.560 align:start position:0%
is present
 
01:45:34.390 --> 01:45:34.400 align:start position:0%
in the state or conducts operations in
 
01:45:37.030 --> 01:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
the state to perform disaster related or
 
01:45:39.270 --> 01:45:39.280 align:start position:0%
emergency related work during a disaster
 
01:45:40.709 --> 01:45:40.719 align:start position:0%
response period
 
01:45:43.430 --> 01:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
shall provide upon request by the
 
01:45:44.390 --> 01:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
secretary of state
 
01:45:48.149 --> 01:45:48.159 align:start position:0%
written statement so it just
 
01:45:50.229 --> 01:45:50.239 align:start position:0%
uh it would seem to me that the shoe has
 
01:45:52.310 --> 01:45:52.320 align:start position:0%
to be on the other foot that the
 
01:45:54.229 --> 01:45:54.239 align:start position:0%
company who's sending in a force has to
 
01:45:56.830 --> 01:45:56.840 align:start position:0%
let secretary of state know they're
 
01:45:56.840 --> 01:45:58.629 align:start position:0%
let secretary of state know they're
there

01:45:58.629 --> 01:45:58.639 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:46:00.229 --> 01:46:00.239 align:start position:0%
seems very simple but i just have a
 
01:46:01.750 --> 01:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
feeling this is one
 
01:46:05.669 --> 01:46:05.679 align:start position:0%
that would be very difficult in practice
 
01:46:08.709 --> 01:46:08.719 align:start position:0%
can i ask the dra if they have any any
 
01:46:09.590 --> 01:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
input on this
 
01:46:13.030 --> 01:46:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:15.750 --> 01:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
uh representative this is carolyn again
 
01:46:15.760 --> 01:46:16.070 align:start position:0%
uh representative this is carolyn again
i

01:46:16.070 --> 01:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:46:18.870 --> 01:46:18.880 align:start position:0%
don't have any insight on that language
 
01:46:20.950 --> 01:46:20.960 align:start position:0%
i think that part in particular relates
 
01:46:22.870 --> 01:46:22.880 align:start position:0%
more to the business licensing
 
01:46:27.109 --> 01:46:27.119 align:start position:0%
aspect than the tax exemption
 
01:46:29.750 --> 01:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh representative
 
01:46:29.760 --> 01:46:32.550 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh representative
almighty

01:46:32.550 --> 01:46:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:35.830 --> 01:46:35.840 align:start position:0%
thank you i think that this we've been
 
01:46:38.070 --> 01:46:38.080 align:start position:0%
given this bill as something that if we
 
01:46:39.750 --> 01:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
change it it's going to mess up
 
01:46:42.629 --> 01:46:42.639 align:start position:0%
everybody in the national agreement
 
01:46:45.990 --> 01:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
and it makes it rather difficult for
 
01:46:48.070 --> 01:46:48.080 align:start position:0%
things like this where our secretary of
 
01:46:48.080 --> 01:46:48.950 align:start position:0%
things like this where our secretary of
state's

01:46:48.950 --> 01:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
state's
 
01:46:51.350 --> 01:46:51.360 align:start position:0%
corporations office doesn't really do
 
01:46:51.360 --> 01:46:52.470 align:start position:0%
corporations office doesn't really do
much

01:46:52.470 --> 01:46:52.480 align:start position:0%
much
 
01:46:55.830 --> 01:46:55.840 align:start position:0%
in the way of noticing or regulating
 
01:46:55.840 --> 01:46:57.350 align:start position:0%
in the way of noticing or regulating
businesses

01:46:57.350 --> 01:46:57.360 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
01:47:00.470 --> 01:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
they just volunteer to be registered
 
01:47:03.830 --> 01:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
um and i don't know if they're getting
 
01:47:05.669 --> 01:47:05.679 align:start position:0%
better about that there have been some
 
01:47:07.590 --> 01:47:07.600 align:start position:0%
reforms since i last
 
01:47:10.629 --> 01:47:10.639 align:start position:0%
talked to that division which was very
 
01:47:12.229 --> 01:47:12.239 align:start position:0%
hard to talk to
 
01:47:16.149 --> 01:47:16.159 align:start position:0%
um but uh the secretary of state is the
 
01:47:18.070 --> 01:47:18.080 align:start position:0%
one that keeps the
 
01:47:21.109 --> 01:47:21.119 align:start position:0%
the uh forums saying that yes i'm a
 
01:47:21.119 --> 01:47:24.149 align:start position:0%
the uh forums saying that yes i'm a
corporation

01:47:24.149 --> 01:47:24.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:26.070 --> 01:47:26.080 align:start position:0%
right and in that light wouldn't it be
 
01:47:28.070 --> 01:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
more sensible for the secretary of state
 
01:47:29.910 --> 01:47:29.920 align:start position:0%
to passively receive a notice of
 
01:47:29.920 --> 01:47:30.709 align:start position:0%
to passively receive a notice of
presence

01:47:30.709 --> 01:47:30.719 align:start position:0%
presence
 
01:47:32.790 --> 01:47:32.800 align:start position:0%
put it in a file until such time as it
 
01:47:34.629 --> 01:47:34.639 align:start position:0%
might be needed
 
01:47:36.550 --> 01:47:36.560 align:start position:0%
but we're told if we add anything to
 
01:47:38.790 --> 01:47:38.800 align:start position:0%
this bill or delete anything that we're
 
01:47:38.800 --> 01:47:39.270 align:start position:0%
this bill or delete anything that we're
going

01:47:39.270 --> 01:47:39.280 align:start position:0%
going
 
01:47:42.310 --> 01:47:42.320 align:start position:0%
to make trouble for the entire national
 
01:47:45.109 --> 01:47:45.119 align:start position:0%
decision okay i don't feel strongly but
 
01:47:48.229 --> 01:47:48.239 align:start position:0%
it strikes me as a wrinkle in practice
 
01:47:51.109 --> 01:47:51.119 align:start position:0%
that's a good find actually but um i can
 
01:47:53.990 --> 01:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
reach out to the secretary of state
 
01:47:57.189 --> 01:47:57.199 align:start position:0%
i'm sure he's not even aware of this
 
01:47:58.790 --> 01:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
reach out to the head of the corporate
 
01:48:01.030 --> 01:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
division right
 
01:48:02.629 --> 01:48:02.639 align:start position:0%
i don't know who that is nowadays but i
 
01:48:04.149 --> 01:48:04.159 align:start position:0%
can find out i don't either but i
 
01:48:05.350 --> 01:48:05.360 align:start position:0%
understand that
 
01:48:07.910 --> 01:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
it's an improvement i like the idea of
 
01:48:10.070 --> 01:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
soliciting secretary of state's opinion
 
01:48:11.430 --> 01:48:11.440 align:start position:0%
before we pass this
 
01:48:13.830 --> 01:48:13.840 align:start position:0%
yeah i'll do that i know him quite well
 
01:48:15.750 --> 01:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
so i'll reach out to him and then i'll
 
01:48:17.030 --> 01:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
have a quick conversation with him and
 
01:48:19.270 --> 01:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
then have him point me to his
 
01:48:22.870 --> 01:48:22.880 align:start position:0%
corporate division person all right so
 
01:48:25.669 --> 01:48:25.679 align:start position:0%
uh any other comments on this bill yeah
 
01:48:28.709 --> 01:48:28.719 align:start position:0%
i'd like to just comment
 
01:48:32.870 --> 01:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
on that last discussion
 
01:48:36.070 --> 01:48:36.080 align:start position:0%
i think the uh i i don't know but i
 
01:48:40.470 --> 01:48:40.480 align:start position:0%
i i think that the goal of this
 
01:48:45.590 --> 01:48:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:48.950 --> 01:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
emergency responses to uh go forward
 
01:48:48.960 --> 01:48:49.750 align:start position:0%
emergency responses to uh go forward
without

01:48:49.750 --> 01:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
without
 
01:48:52.790 --> 01:48:52.800 align:start position:0%
being encumbered by unnecessary
 
01:48:55.830 --> 01:48:55.840 align:start position:0%
uh red tape and um
 
01:48:58.870 --> 01:48:58.880 align:start position:0%
that probably and i'm just
 
01:49:01.669 --> 01:49:01.679 align:start position:0%
i'd like to hear actually from the uh
 
01:49:03.590 --> 01:49:03.600 align:start position:0%
components of this bill more than from
 
01:49:06.229 --> 01:49:06.239 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state
 
01:49:09.669 --> 01:49:09.679 align:start position:0%
they were trying to develop
 
01:49:12.830 --> 01:49:12.840 align:start position:0%
a envelope within which
 
01:49:17.750 --> 01:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
business could operate without having
 
01:49:19.990 --> 01:49:20.000 align:start position:0%
in the first instance to clear a hurdle
 
01:49:22.070 --> 01:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
with the secretary of state
 
01:49:25.350 --> 01:49:25.360 align:start position:0%
um and perhaps this language about
 
01:49:25.360 --> 01:49:27.189 align:start position:0%
um and perhaps this language about
notification

01:49:27.189 --> 01:49:27.199 align:start position:0%
notification
 
01:49:29.910 --> 01:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
which is triggered only by a request by
 
01:49:31.910 --> 01:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state
 
01:49:35.910 --> 01:49:35.920 align:start position:0%
is to enable people to go
 
01:49:39.109 --> 01:49:39.119 align:start position:0%
to the secretary of state and say hey
 
01:49:42.470 --> 01:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
this business is in our state uh and
 
01:49:45.830 --> 01:49:45.840 align:start position:0%
um and this needs to
 
01:49:49.750 --> 01:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
um go through a review process
 
01:49:52.070 --> 01:49:52.080 align:start position:0%
because of this or that in other words
 
01:49:52.790 --> 01:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
it's it's
 
01:49:56.629 --> 01:49:56.639 align:start position:0%
uh it's it's sort of enabling a uh
 
01:49:59.990 --> 01:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
complaint a concern to be brought to the
 
01:50:00.709 --> 01:50:00.719 align:start position:0%
attention of
 
01:50:02.310 --> 01:50:02.320 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state and then to have
 
01:50:04.790 --> 01:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
a procedure that's in place for the
 
01:50:06.950 --> 01:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
secretary of state to follow
 
01:50:10.870 --> 01:50:10.880 align:start position:0%
that's that's just a i suppose a guess
 
01:50:13.510 --> 01:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
on my part trying to make sense of this
 
01:50:15.189 --> 01:50:15.199 align:start position:0%
because obviously the secretary of state
 
01:50:16.870 --> 01:50:16.880 align:start position:0%
in the ordinary course wouldn't know
 
01:50:19.589 --> 01:50:19.599 align:start position:0%
about these businesses
 
01:50:21.270 --> 01:50:21.280 align:start position:0%
so i'd like to hear from the sponsors
 
01:50:25.189 --> 01:50:25.199 align:start position:0%
about this sponsor get the explanation
 
01:50:27.350 --> 01:50:27.360 align:start position:0%
the sponsor is senator bradley i can
 
01:50:30.149 --> 01:50:30.159 align:start position:0%
reach out to senator bradley
 
01:50:33.270 --> 01:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
and see if he can spare some time next
 
01:50:34.070 --> 01:50:34.080 align:start position:0%
week or
 
01:50:37.990 --> 01:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
even tomorrow
 
01:50:39.830 --> 01:50:39.840 align:start position:0%
maybe hard to get a hold of him right
 
01:50:42.310 --> 01:50:42.320 align:start position:0%
away but i'll try this afternoon
 
01:50:44.550 --> 01:50:44.560 align:start position:0%
track him down and see if he's uh
 
01:50:45.589 --> 01:50:45.599 align:start position:0%
willing to
 
01:50:49.030 --> 01:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
shed some light on this okay
 
01:50:52.070 --> 01:50:52.080 align:start position:0%
yeah if i could we have to remember
 
01:50:55.030 --> 01:50:55.040 align:start position:0%
that this is a model bill that has not
 
01:50:56.310 --> 01:50:56.320 align:start position:0%
been changed
 
01:50:59.350 --> 01:50:59.360 align:start position:0%
it is meant for the entire country
 
01:51:02.390 --> 01:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
and the idea
 
01:51:04.149 --> 01:51:04.159 align:start position:0%
is that you wouldn't have to look up
 
01:51:06.070 --> 01:51:06.080 align:start position:0%
each state's regulations before
 
01:51:09.750 --> 01:51:09.760 align:start position:0%
you went racing in to help and
 
01:51:13.910 --> 01:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
on that other states i am quite sure
 
01:51:17.109 --> 01:51:17.119 align:start position:0%
on that their secretaries of state
 
01:51:19.189 --> 01:51:19.199 align:start position:0%
do more than our corporate division does
 
01:51:21.830 --> 01:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
what the corporate division does
 
01:51:24.070 --> 01:51:24.080 align:start position:0%
uh well maybe they're doing a bit more
 
01:51:25.030 --> 01:51:25.040 align:start position:0%
now but
 
01:51:26.709 --> 01:51:26.719 align:start position:0%
but what they're supposed they're
 
01:51:28.550 --> 01:51:28.560 align:start position:0%
charged with doing is
 
01:51:32.149 --> 01:51:32.159 align:start position:0%
to accept on requests for
 
01:51:35.270 --> 01:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
on certification of your business and
 
01:51:36.070 --> 01:51:36.080 align:start position:0%
your title
 
01:51:39.350 --> 01:51:39.360 align:start position:0%
at the title of your business some of
 
01:51:40.550 --> 01:51:40.560 align:start position:0%
you may have noticed
 
01:51:44.629 --> 01:51:44.639 align:start position:0%
that about trapping
 
01:51:47.589 --> 01:51:47.599 align:start position:0%
that just got resolved through a lawsuit
 
01:51:47.599 --> 01:51:48.229 align:start position:0%
that just got resolved through a lawsuit
where

01:51:48.229 --> 01:51:48.239 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:51:51.510 --> 01:51:51.520 align:start position:0%
a guy who was a trapper took over
 
01:51:55.030 --> 01:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
the corporate names of of
 
01:51:57.990 --> 01:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
on two organizations set up by a woman
 
01:52:00.229 --> 01:52:00.239 align:start position:0%
who was running an anti-trapping
 
01:52:02.390 --> 01:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
group and hadn't thought to register her
 
01:52:02.400 --> 01:52:04.390 align:start position:0%
group and hadn't thought to register her
names

01:52:04.390 --> 01:52:04.400 align:start position:0%
names
 
01:52:08.390 --> 01:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
and uh i've tried to look at that a
 
01:52:10.629 --> 01:52:10.639 align:start position:0%
number of times trying to figure out how
 
01:52:12.310 --> 01:52:12.320 align:start position:0%
many businesses we've got that are
 
01:52:14.149 --> 01:52:14.159 align:start position:0%
really businesses active
 
01:52:17.510 --> 01:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
in this state they don't or at least
 
01:52:19.430 --> 01:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
a couple of years ago they still had no
 
01:52:19.440 --> 01:52:21.350 align:start position:0%
a couple of years ago they still had no
idea

01:52:21.350 --> 01:52:21.360 align:start position:0%
idea
 
01:52:23.430 --> 01:52:23.440 align:start position:0%
they'll register something and then they
 
01:52:25.910 --> 01:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
won't do anything with it
 
01:52:29.030 --> 01:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
so so it's really a question of asking
 
01:52:30.470 --> 01:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
the corporate division
 
01:52:32.550 --> 01:52:32.560 align:start position:0%
what it's doing now but we've got to
 
01:52:33.830 --> 01:52:33.840 align:start position:0%
remember that
 
01:52:35.750 --> 01:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
our secretary of state's office is
 
01:52:38.870 --> 01:52:38.880 align:start position:0%
different than all the others
 
01:52:41.830 --> 01:52:41.840 align:start position:0%
in the country that's a good point so
 
01:52:44.149 --> 01:52:44.159 align:start position:0%
i'll reach out to both um
 
01:52:47.350 --> 01:52:47.360 align:start position:0%
and we'll go from there any other
 
01:52:50.629 --> 01:52:50.639 align:start position:0%
comments questions okay
 
01:52:53.270 --> 01:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
so hopefully we'll get some information
 
01:52:54.950 --> 01:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
and and perhaps some
 
01:52:58.070 --> 01:52:58.080 align:start position:0%
additional testimony next week
 
01:53:01.750 --> 01:53:01.760 align:start position:0%
on this all right
 
01:53:05.310 --> 01:53:05.320 align:start position:0%
the next one is senate bill
 
01:53:05.320 --> 01:53:08.149 align:start position:0%
the next one is senate bill
2011

01:53:08.149 --> 01:53:08.159 align:start position:0%
2011
 
01:53:10.550 --> 01:53:10.560 align:start position:0%
which is the the senate version of the
 
01:53:13.430 --> 01:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming bill
 
01:53:16.870 --> 01:53:16.880 align:start position:0%
uh the senate as you're all aware i
 
01:53:17.589 --> 01:53:17.599 align:start position:0%
think that
 
01:53:23.830 --> 01:53:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:27.030 --> 01:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
it passed on consent last week uh with
 
01:53:28.629 --> 01:53:28.639 align:start position:0%
no changes
 
01:53:31.750 --> 01:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
so that's that's already in the works um
 
01:53:36.629 --> 01:53:36.639 align:start position:0%
in the conversation with with senator um
 
01:53:39.990 --> 01:53:40.000 align:start position:0%
guida he's and and
 
01:53:42.870 --> 01:53:42.880 align:start position:0%
senator french who's the prime sponsor
 
01:53:43.589 --> 01:53:43.599 align:start position:0%
of this
 
01:53:47.430 --> 01:53:47.440 align:start position:0%
of of uh of 112
 
01:53:51.270 --> 01:53:51.280 align:start position:0%
uh that uh he's willing to
 
01:53:55.109 --> 01:53:55.119 align:start position:0%
make 626 the primary bill
 
01:53:57.030 --> 01:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
and has no problem if we were to retain
 
01:53:58.629 --> 01:53:58.639 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:54:02.229 --> 01:54:02.239 align:start position:0%
uh or whatever we decide to do with it
 
01:54:04.550 --> 01:54:04.560 align:start position:0%
but uh but that's that's already worked
 
01:54:05.589 --> 01:54:05.599 align:start position:0%
out with the senate
 
01:54:09.030 --> 01:54:09.040 align:start position:0%
so there they're in agreement that 626
 
01:54:10.310 --> 01:54:10.320 align:start position:0%
moves forward
 
01:54:13.430 --> 01:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
and if we want to we want to kill off
 
01:54:16.790 --> 01:54:16.800 align:start position:0%
112 they're okay with that so
 
01:54:20.390 --> 01:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
uh so i don't know i think the debate
 
01:54:23.030 --> 01:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
we've had to debate on this it's just
 
01:54:24.390 --> 01:54:24.400 align:start position:0%
their bills are identical
 
01:54:26.950 --> 01:54:26.960 align:start position:0%
with one or two little grammatical
 
01:54:28.070 --> 01:54:28.080 align:start position:0%
issues that
 
01:54:31.589 --> 01:54:31.599 align:start position:0%
uh there that are there that are minor
 
01:54:31.599 --> 01:54:32.870 align:start position:0%
uh there that are there that are minor
minor

01:54:32.870 --> 01:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
minor
 
01:54:37.350 --> 01:54:37.360 align:start position:0%
uh so um does anybody have any
 
01:54:39.589 --> 01:54:39.599 align:start position:0%
comments or other input they want on on
 
01:54:43.430 --> 01:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:47.189 --> 01:54:47.199 align:start position:0%
seeing none okay we'll move forward
 
01:54:50.229 --> 01:54:50.239 align:start position:0%
and the last bill
 
01:54:53.430 --> 01:54:53.440 align:start position:0%
is senate bill three
 
01:54:53.440 --> 01:54:56.709 align:start position:0%
is senate bill three
um

01:54:56.709 --> 01:54:56.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:58.950 --> 01:54:58.960 align:start position:0%
so here's what's going to happen
 
01:55:00.790 --> 01:55:00.800 align:start position:0%
tomorrow morning
 
01:55:03.990 --> 01:55:04.000 align:start position:0%
uh and i think we started
 
01:55:07.910 --> 01:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
10 tomorrow um we were able to
 
01:55:11.189 --> 01:55:11.199 align:start position:0%
secure two two two uh
 
01:55:12.709 --> 01:55:12.719 align:start position:0%
one of the one of the one of them i
 
01:55:14.229 --> 01:55:14.239 align:start position:0%
forget their names now but
 
01:55:18.709 --> 01:55:18.719 align:start position:0%
uh one of them is the chair of the
 
01:55:22.390 --> 01:55:22.400 align:start position:0%
tax accountants group
 
01:55:25.350 --> 01:55:25.360 align:start position:0%
and and one other very active tax
 
01:55:25.360 --> 01:55:26.709 align:start position:0%
and and one other very active tax
accountant

01:55:26.709 --> 01:55:26.719 align:start position:0%
accountant
 
01:55:31.510 --> 01:55:31.520 align:start position:0%
that uh will give us a sense of
 
01:55:34.629 --> 01:55:34.639 align:start position:0%
what they think their members
 
01:55:38.310 --> 01:55:38.320 align:start position:0%
or their their their advice that their
 
01:55:39.270 --> 01:55:39.280 align:start position:0%
members had given
 
01:55:43.109 --> 01:55:43.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:46.149 --> 01:55:46.159 align:start position:0%
tax tax attorneys in terms of and they
 
01:55:46.629 --> 01:55:46.639 align:start position:0%
did a
 
01:55:48.709 --> 01:55:48.719 align:start position:0%
informal poll over the weekend that
 
01:55:50.709 --> 01:55:50.719 align:start position:0%
they're going to share with us
 
01:55:51.669 --> 01:55:51.679 align:start position:0%
they said they didn't have time to do
 
01:55:54.070 --> 01:55:54.080 align:start position:0%
anything formal uh to give us a sense of
 
01:55:56.310 --> 01:55:56.320 align:start position:0%
how much of that
 
01:55:59.350 --> 01:55:59.360 align:start position:0%
uh 75 million or uh
 
01:56:02.070 --> 01:56:02.080 align:start position:0%
that was collected in business taxes was
 
01:56:02.080 --> 01:56:03.189 align:start position:0%
that was collected in business taxes was
really

01:56:03.189 --> 01:56:03.199 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:56:07.350 --> 01:56:07.360 align:start position:0%
due to their advice that they
 
01:56:11.109 --> 01:56:11.119 align:start position:0%
file under current statute and not uh
 
01:56:14.390 --> 01:56:14.400 align:start position:0%
under sb three
 
01:56:17.910 --> 01:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
uh changes so so that's
 
01:56:20.070 --> 01:56:20.080 align:start position:0%
that's one big thing that we you know
 
01:56:22.550 --> 01:56:22.560 align:start position:0%
that we've been asking for and uh
 
01:56:25.750 --> 01:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
and the dra is
 
01:56:28.629 --> 01:56:28.639 align:start position:0%
also going to still owes us some
 
01:56:28.639 --> 01:56:29.430 align:start position:0%
also going to still owes us some
information

01:56:29.430 --> 01:56:29.440 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:56:33.189 --> 01:56:33.199 align:start position:0%
on if we do pass this
 
01:56:37.430 --> 01:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
what is the implication from
 
01:56:40.709 --> 01:56:40.719 align:start position:0%
tax wise for next fiscal year
 
01:56:44.550 --> 01:56:44.560 align:start position:0%
and the year after that as well as
 
01:56:48.629 --> 01:56:48.639 align:start position:0%
the year that um people just filed for
 
01:56:52.070 --> 01:56:52.080 align:start position:0%
which was uh uh 20.
 
01:56:55.910 --> 01:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
so um so that's why we stand in that and
 
01:56:57.589 --> 01:56:57.599 align:start position:0%
then we also have an amendment
 
01:56:59.910 --> 01:56:59.920 align:start position:0%
uh that's coming and i i know
 
01:57:02.310 --> 01:57:02.320 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury
 
01:57:05.350 --> 01:57:05.360 align:start position:0%
um shared with us not the actual
 
01:57:07.669 --> 01:57:07.679 align:start position:0%
amendment but what the
 
01:57:09.350 --> 01:57:09.360 align:start position:0%
what what the amendment will actually
 
01:57:09.360 --> 01:57:12.629 align:start position:0%
what what the amendment will actually
say

01:57:12.629 --> 01:57:12.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:13.669 --> 01:57:13.679 align:start position:0%
and if you wanted to i think the
 
01:57:17.270 --> 01:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:19.990 --> 01:57:20.000 align:start position:0%
representative abrami the uh formal
 
01:57:21.830 --> 01:57:21.840 align:start position:0%
amendment came from oelis this morning
 
01:57:24.709 --> 01:57:24.719 align:start position:0%
at 8 45. so
 
01:57:26.709 --> 01:57:26.719 align:start position:0%
i was only able to forward a short time
 
01:57:29.510 --> 01:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
before our session this morning
 
01:57:32.550 --> 01:57:32.560 align:start position:0%
all right um but it looks
 
01:57:34.709 --> 01:57:34.719 align:start position:0%
pretty much exactly like your language i
 
01:57:34.719 --> 01:57:35.830 align:start position:0%
pretty much exactly like your language i
think

01:57:35.830 --> 01:57:35.840 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:57:37.589 --> 01:57:37.599 align:start position:0%
it's identical did not change that's
 
01:57:39.830 --> 01:57:39.840 align:start position:0%
right right thank you
 
01:57:42.870 --> 01:57:42.880 align:start position:0%
at 9 15 this morning so do we want to
 
01:57:44.390 --> 01:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
spend a few minutes now just
 
01:57:47.510 --> 01:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
talking through that amendment um
 
01:57:50.870 --> 01:57:50.880 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury
 
01:57:53.910 --> 01:57:53.920 align:start position:0%
sure um i suppose i could go on at great
 
01:57:55.030 --> 01:57:55.040 align:start position:0%
length but we've all been hearing the
 
01:57:56.790 --> 01:57:56.800 align:start position:0%
same thing so i won't recap everything
 
01:57:57.990 --> 01:57:58.000 align:start position:0%
we've heard
 
01:58:01.589 --> 01:58:01.599 align:start position:0%
uh essentially congress acted in two
 
01:58:01.599 --> 01:58:02.709 align:start position:0%
uh essentially congress acted in two
stages

01:58:02.709 --> 01:58:02.719 align:start position:0%
stages
 
01:58:05.270 --> 01:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
when they enacted the cares act in march
 
01:58:05.280 --> 01:58:06.629 align:start position:0%
when they enacted the cares act in march
20

01:58:06.629 --> 01:58:06.639 align:start position:0%
20
 
01:58:09.589 --> 01:58:09.599 align:start position:0%
they did provide to have forgiven debt
 
01:58:09.599 --> 01:58:10.870 align:start position:0%
they did provide to have forgiven debt
excluded

01:58:10.870 --> 01:58:10.880 align:start position:0%
excluded
 
01:58:13.589 --> 01:58:13.599 align:start position:0%
from taxable income because the normal
 
01:58:15.990 --> 01:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
rule under the internal revenue code
 
01:58:17.830 --> 01:58:17.840 align:start position:0%
is whenever debt is forgiven it's
 
01:58:17.840 --> 01:58:19.510 align:start position:0%
is whenever debt is forgiven it's
taxable

01:58:19.510 --> 01:58:19.520 align:start position:0%
taxable
 
01:58:22.870 --> 01:58:22.880 align:start position:0%
it wasn't until their december
 
01:58:26.790 --> 01:58:26.800 align:start position:0%
um second stage law that they
 
01:58:30.390 --> 01:58:30.400 align:start position:0%
also made it clear
 
01:58:34.070 --> 01:58:34.080 align:start position:0%
that expenses can be deducted so that as
 
01:58:37.910 --> 01:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
it stands is the federal situation
 
01:58:41.109 --> 01:58:41.119 align:start position:0%
by the accounting we've heard 22 states
 
01:58:43.350 --> 01:58:43.360 align:start position:0%
conform automatically
 
01:58:47.669 --> 01:58:47.679 align:start position:0%
another group of states has taken action
 
01:58:50.790 --> 01:58:50.800 align:start position:0%
to conform and that leaves 11 states
 
01:58:54.470 --> 01:58:54.480 align:start position:0%
that apparently are poised to
 
01:58:57.510 --> 01:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
leave forgiven ppp debt is taxable in
 
01:58:59.830 --> 01:58:59.840 align:start position:0%
new hampshire of course is one of those
 
01:59:01.830 --> 01:59:01.840 align:start position:0%
because we don't automatically conform
 
01:59:04.070 --> 01:59:04.080 align:start position:0%
because we refer two years back so
 
01:59:07.669 --> 01:59:07.679 align:start position:0%
2018 version of the code
 
01:59:14.229 --> 01:59:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:16.790 --> 01:59:16.800 align:start position:0%
whether to act to conform regarding the
 
01:59:20.470 --> 01:59:20.480 align:start position:0%
non-taxation of forgiven ppp
 
01:59:23.669 --> 01:59:23.679 align:start position:0%
is one issue and it is distinct
 
01:59:25.430 --> 01:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
from the question whether to also
 
01:59:28.629 --> 01:59:28.639 align:start position:0%
conform to the december legislation
 
01:59:32.070 --> 01:59:32.080 align:start position:0%
allowing further deduction uh that lives
 
01:59:34.310 --> 01:59:34.320 align:start position:0%
outside the internal revenue code
 
01:59:36.229 --> 01:59:36.239 align:start position:0%
and in the same way that they were dealt
 
01:59:37.990 --> 01:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
with separately at two different times
 
01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:38.950 align:start position:0%
with separately at two different times
by

01:59:38.950 --> 01:59:38.960 align:start position:0%
by
 
01:59:42.550 --> 01:59:42.560 align:start position:0%
congress i don't want us to view them
 
01:59:44.550 --> 01:59:44.560 align:start position:0%
as though they're necessarily entwined
 
01:59:45.589 --> 01:59:45.599 align:start position:0%
we can have
 
01:59:50.229 --> 01:59:50.239 align:start position:0%
one or the other or neither or both
 
01:59:54.629 --> 01:59:54.639 align:start position:0%
um so we have 25 000 businesses in new
 
01:59:56.830 --> 01:59:56.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire who have received ppp
 
02:00:01.030 --> 02:00:01.040 align:start position:0%
loans and of course
 
02:00:04.470 --> 02:00:04.480 align:start position:0%
we have nsv3 a proposal
 
02:00:07.589 --> 02:00:07.599 align:start position:0%
both to exclude those from
 
02:00:11.750 --> 02:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
taxable income and also in
 
02:00:15.589 --> 02:00:15.599 align:start position:0%
paragraph two to allow the expenses to
 
02:00:17.669 --> 02:00:17.679 align:start position:0%
be further deducted so the purpose of
 
02:00:19.669 --> 02:00:19.679 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
02:00:23.189 --> 02:00:23.199 align:start position:0%
is to reverse paragraph
 
02:00:26.229 --> 02:00:26.239 align:start position:0%
two so that instead of saying no
 
02:00:29.109 --> 02:00:29.119 align:start position:0%
deduction shall be denied
 
02:00:31.990 --> 02:00:32.000 align:start position:0%
it says no deduction shall be allowed
 
02:00:33.430 --> 02:00:33.440 align:start position:0%
but with the dras
 
02:00:35.189 --> 02:00:35.199 align:start position:0%
help we've also included no tax
 
02:00:36.709 --> 02:00:36.719 align:start position:0%
attributes will be adjusted
 
02:00:38.790 --> 02:00:38.800 align:start position:0%
and no basis shall be adjusted for an
 
02:00:38.800 --> 02:00:39.750 align:start position:0%
and no basis shall be adjusted for an
expense

02:00:39.750 --> 02:00:39.760 align:start position:0%
expense
 
02:00:42.070 --> 02:00:42.080 align:start position:0%
that is otherwise deductible if the
 
02:00:42.080 --> 02:00:43.030 align:start position:0%
that is otherwise deductible if the
payment

02:00:43.030 --> 02:00:43.040 align:start position:0%
payment
 
02:00:46.229 --> 02:00:46.239 align:start position:0%
at the expense results in forgiveness uh
 
02:00:47.589 --> 02:00:47.599 align:start position:0%
and the income associated with
 
02:00:49.430 --> 02:00:49.440 align:start position:0%
forgiveness is excluded from gross
 
02:00:49.440 --> 02:00:49.990 align:start position:0%
forgiveness is excluded from gross
income

02:00:49.990 --> 02:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
income
 
02:00:51.750 --> 02:00:51.760 align:start position:0%
pursuant to paragraph one which is to
 
02:00:54.070 --> 02:00:54.080 align:start position:0%
say specifically
 
02:00:56.390 --> 02:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
in the context of the ppp and the
 
02:00:56.400 --> 02:00:57.350 align:start position:0%
in the context of the ppp and the
following

02:00:57.350 --> 02:00:57.360 align:start position:0%
following
 
02:01:00.870 --> 02:01:00.880 align:start position:0%
law so so that's the proposal the
 
02:01:02.629 --> 02:01:02.639 align:start position:0%
proposal of this amendment
 
02:01:06.550 --> 02:01:06.560 align:start position:0%
is to take those two issues
 
02:01:09.589 --> 02:01:09.599 align:start position:0%
treat them separately and reach a
 
02:01:11.510 --> 02:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
different conclusion
 
02:01:15.109 --> 02:01:15.119 align:start position:0%
so sb3 would then exclude
 
02:01:19.910 --> 02:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
forgiven debt from taxable income
 
02:01:21.830 --> 02:01:21.840 align:start position:0%
but it would not then allow the
 
02:01:24.550 --> 02:01:24.560 align:start position:0%
deductions which qualified
 
02:01:27.830 --> 02:01:27.840 align:start position:0%
that ppp fund for uh
 
02:01:30.950 --> 02:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
forgiveness to be used against
 
02:01:34.310 --> 02:01:34.320 align:start position:0%
other income so so can i assess a
 
02:01:35.750 --> 02:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
question right there
 
02:01:39.030 --> 02:01:39.040 align:start position:0%
so so let's say there's salaries
 
02:01:41.669 --> 02:01:41.679 align:start position:0%
or normally a business expense that
 
02:01:43.270 --> 02:01:43.280 align:start position:0%
would come off
 
02:01:46.709 --> 02:01:46.719 align:start position:0%
the revenue as we work our way down to
 
02:01:50.229 --> 02:01:50.239 align:start position:0%
what the net profit is correct
 
02:01:52.550 --> 02:01:52.560 align:start position:0%
that's correct what we're saying is that
 
02:01:54.229 --> 02:01:54.239 align:start position:0%
uh with your amendment
 
02:01:57.669 --> 02:01:57.679 align:start position:0%
we would not allow those
 
02:02:02.149 --> 02:02:02.159 align:start position:0%
anything that was paid for by ppp
 
02:02:04.709 --> 02:02:04.719 align:start position:0%
cannot be deducted is that correct
 
02:02:06.470 --> 02:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
whatever the expense is
 
02:02:10.229 --> 02:02:10.239 align:start position:0%
whether it's or you know that's exactly
 
02:02:12.310 --> 02:02:12.320 align:start position:0%
correct so just just to clarify uh
 
02:02:14.070 --> 02:02:14.080 align:start position:0%
representative romney
 
02:02:17.510 --> 02:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
um the
 
02:02:20.629 --> 02:02:20.639 align:start position:0%
the cares act established two different
 
02:02:22.790 --> 02:02:22.800 align:start position:0%
uh criteria one is that you had to use
 
02:02:25.669 --> 02:02:25.679 align:start position:0%
the funds for qualified expenses
 
02:02:28.790 --> 02:02:28.800 align:start position:0%
and you had to use at least 60 percent
 
02:02:29.350 --> 02:02:29.360 align:start position:0%
of it
 
02:02:33.109 --> 02:02:33.119 align:start position:0%
for payroll i suspect that in many cases
 
02:02:34.870 --> 02:02:34.880 align:start position:0%
100 of it was used for payroll but
 
02:02:36.790 --> 02:02:36.800 align:start position:0%
that's not material
 
02:02:40.070 --> 02:02:40.080 align:start position:0%
you would get your loan forgiven
 
02:02:42.470 --> 02:02:42.480 align:start position:0%
if you spend it for qualified expenses
 
02:02:43.669 --> 02:02:43.679 align:start position:0%
at least 60
 
02:02:46.950 --> 02:02:46.960 align:start position:0%
of which were payroll so we know
 
02:02:50.550 --> 02:02:50.560 align:start position:0%
inherently that any expenses that
 
02:02:54.229 --> 02:02:54.239 align:start position:0%
qualify the ppp for forgiveness
 
02:02:56.709 --> 02:02:56.719 align:start position:0%
um are the same kinds of expenses that
 
02:02:57.910 --> 02:02:57.920 align:start position:0%
could be deducted
 
02:03:02.310 --> 02:03:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:05.510 --> 02:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
right so um then my next question i know
 
02:03:06.870 --> 02:03:06.880 align:start position:0%
this is from hands
 
02:03:10.629 --> 02:03:10.639 align:start position:0%
um so what does this do
 
02:03:13.270 --> 02:03:13.280 align:start position:0%
to the numbers is this something that
 
02:03:15.430 --> 02:03:15.440 align:start position:0%
you've asked the dra to take a look at
 
02:03:19.589 --> 02:03:19.599 align:start position:0%
as well i i've asked but i was advised
 
02:03:19.599 --> 02:03:20.470 align:start position:0%
as well i i've asked but i was advised
that

02:03:20.470 --> 02:03:20.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:03:22.310 --> 02:03:22.320 align:start position:0%
uh until it was determined what
 
02:03:24.310 --> 02:03:24.320 align:start position:0%
direction the committee wanted to take
 
02:03:26.229 --> 02:03:26.239 align:start position:0%
they were going to hold off
 
02:03:29.430 --> 02:03:29.440 align:start position:0%
uh i think it's fair to say
 
02:03:33.589 --> 02:03:33.599 align:start position:0%
that the bulk of the 91 million dollars
 
02:03:36.950 --> 02:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
that was estimated as a reduction of
 
02:03:39.669 --> 02:03:39.679 align:start position:0%
revenue to the state
 
02:03:43.669 --> 02:03:43.679 align:start position:0%
um would be reversed
 
02:03:46.870 --> 02:03:46.880 align:start position:0%
there are some complications i i i'm not
 
02:03:49.910 --> 02:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
entirely sure that in all cases 100
 
02:03:53.589 --> 02:03:53.599 align:start position:0%
of the ppp uh loans have been offset by
 
02:03:55.510 --> 02:03:55.520 align:start position:0%
deductible expenses
 
02:03:58.470 --> 02:03:58.480 align:start position:0%
and we also have the question of how the
 
02:03:58.480 --> 02:04:00.149 align:start position:0%
and we also have the question of how the
bet

02:04:00.149 --> 02:04:00.159 align:start position:0%
bet
 
02:04:04.229 --> 02:04:04.239 align:start position:0%
factors into things so i i do
 
02:04:06.550 --> 02:04:06.560 align:start position:0%
i am anxious to see dras assessment but
 
02:04:08.229 --> 02:04:08.239 align:start position:0%
i think it's fair to assume most of the
 
02:04:10.550 --> 02:04:10.560 align:start position:0%
91 million would be
 
02:04:13.910 --> 02:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
um retained okay
 
02:04:16.149 --> 02:04:16.159 align:start position:0%
we've got three hands on the verbs of
 
02:04:17.830 --> 02:04:17.840 align:start position:0%
almighty then representative ames and
 
02:04:21.510 --> 02:04:21.520 align:start position:0%
uh represent representative gennady and
 
02:04:25.669 --> 02:04:25.679 align:start position:0%
president romney thank you on
 
02:04:29.189 --> 02:04:29.199 align:start position:0%
this this amendment
 
02:04:32.149 --> 02:04:32.159 align:start position:0%
would hit the businesses that are
 
02:04:34.229 --> 02:04:34.239 align:start position:0%
struggling and not all of the one
 
02:04:36.310 --> 02:04:36.320 align:start position:0%
the trouble is that not all of the
 
02:04:36.320 --> 02:04:37.510 align:start position:0%
the trouble is that not all of the
businesses

02:04:37.510 --> 02:04:37.520 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
02:04:40.629 --> 02:04:40.639 align:start position:0%
that got ppp were struggling i
 
02:04:44.550 --> 02:04:44.560 align:start position:0%
bet not half of them were
 
02:04:48.550 --> 02:04:48.560 align:start position:0%
but struggling badly but the ones that
 
02:04:53.109 --> 02:04:53.119 align:start position:0%
were that got the ppp loans
 
02:04:56.950 --> 02:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
to give um keep their employees
 
02:05:00.149 --> 02:05:00.159 align:start position:0%
and give gave them that make work
 
02:05:02.709 --> 02:05:02.719 align:start position:0%
and got very little profit during that
 
02:05:05.189 --> 02:05:05.199 align:start position:0%
period that they were closed down
 
02:05:07.830 --> 02:05:07.840 align:start position:0%
and maybe after for a while as they were
 
02:05:09.030 --> 02:05:09.040 align:start position:0%
coming back
 
02:05:12.550 --> 02:05:12.560 align:start position:0%
they have lost months or a year
 
02:05:15.830 --> 02:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
of of profits
 
02:05:19.589 --> 02:05:19.599 align:start position:0%
if we do this on and
 
02:05:22.550 --> 02:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
well they have lost a month months or a
 
02:05:23.830 --> 02:05:23.840 align:start position:0%
year of profits
 
02:05:27.830 --> 02:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
and on are trying to bring their
 
02:05:28.790 --> 02:05:28.800 align:start position:0%
business back
 
02:05:32.629 --> 02:05:32.639 align:start position:0%
up to normal now and
 
02:05:39.430 --> 02:05:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:43.510 --> 02:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
on last year on what profit they did get
 
02:05:47.350 --> 02:05:47.360 align:start position:0%
so it's a question in there about
 
02:05:49.910 --> 02:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
how many of the businesses had enough
 
02:05:51.669 --> 02:05:51.679 align:start position:0%
profit that they would be showing
 
02:05:54.870 --> 02:05:54.880 align:start position:0%
up for bpt
 
02:05:59.030 --> 02:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
in the first place on but
 
02:06:02.069 --> 02:06:02.079 align:start position:0%
for whom the profit
 
02:06:05.350 --> 02:06:05.360 align:start position:0%
that they did did have enough profit to
 
02:06:05.360 --> 02:06:05.750 align:start position:0%
that they did did have enough profit to
be

02:06:05.750 --> 02:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:06:08.950 --> 02:06:08.960 align:start position:0%
taxed but that profit was not their
 
02:06:10.310 --> 02:06:10.320 align:start position:0%
normal profit
 
02:06:12.390 --> 02:06:12.400 align:start position:0%
and was not what they were using
 
02:06:12.400 --> 02:06:13.430 align:start position:0%
and was not what they were using
normally

02:06:13.430 --> 02:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
normally
 
02:06:15.350 --> 02:06:15.360 align:start position:0%
for their own maintenance or to grow the
 
02:06:15.360 --> 02:06:16.709 align:start position:0%
for their own maintenance or to grow the
business

02:06:16.709 --> 02:06:16.719 align:start position:0%
business
 
02:06:19.750 --> 02:06:19.760 align:start position:0%
i don't see any uh impact of the be
 
02:06:23.510 --> 02:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
on the bpt that they have to pay
 
02:06:26.229 --> 02:06:26.239 align:start position:0%
from whether we do the bill as it is or
 
02:06:27.589 --> 02:06:27.599 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
02:06:29.910 --> 02:06:29.920 align:start position:0%
uh i think that's that's just there as a
 
02:06:29.920 --> 02:06:31.270 align:start position:0%
uh i think that's that's just there as a
base

02:06:31.270 --> 02:06:31.280 align:start position:0%
base
 
02:06:34.229 --> 02:06:34.239 align:start position:0%
and so anybody who is only paying bet
 
02:06:35.750 --> 02:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
isn't going to be affected by any of
 
02:06:37.430 --> 02:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
this anyway
 
02:06:39.830 --> 02:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
so several comments that's absolutely
 
02:06:41.350 --> 02:06:41.360 align:start position:0%
correct sp3
 
02:06:43.270 --> 02:06:43.280 align:start position:0%
exclusively addresses business profits
 
02:06:45.830 --> 02:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
tax it's silent on business enterprise
 
02:06:45.840 --> 02:06:46.870 align:start position:0%
tax it's silent on business enterprise
tax

02:06:46.870 --> 02:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
tax
 
02:06:50.229 --> 02:06:50.239 align:start position:0%
and likewise the amendment um follows
 
02:06:50.239 --> 02:06:50.629 align:start position:0%
and likewise the amendment um follows
that

02:06:50.629 --> 02:06:50.639 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:06:55.350 --> 02:06:55.360 align:start position:0%
that same economy but
 
02:06:59.030 --> 02:06:59.040 align:start position:0%
basically the approach of sbe3 unamended
 
02:07:00.950 --> 02:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
can only benefit
 
02:07:04.629 --> 02:07:04.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:06.790 --> 02:07:06.800 align:start position:0%
because we only tax profit we're not
 
02:07:08.629 --> 02:07:08.639 align:start position:0%
taxing revenue there are states that
 
02:07:10.550 --> 02:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
have gross receipts taxes we're not one
 
02:07:12.790 --> 02:07:12.800 align:start position:0%
of them um
 
02:07:16.870 --> 02:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:18.790 --> 02:07:18.800 align:start position:0%
earned no profit isn't vulnerable to
 
02:07:21.990 --> 02:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
being taxed or unforgiven ppp loans
 
02:07:24.470 --> 02:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
a business that struggled without
 
02:07:26.709 --> 02:07:26.719 align:start position:0%
generating profit wouldn't be exposed
 
02:07:28.470 --> 02:07:28.480 align:start position:0%
one that closed permanently wouldn't be
 
02:07:31.109 --> 02:07:31.119 align:start position:0%
exposed the greatest hardship cases
 
02:07:33.990 --> 02:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
don't benefit from this bill at all
 
02:07:36.950 --> 02:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
uh that's the irony of it and and i
 
02:07:38.390 --> 02:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
could go on and on
 
02:07:39.669 --> 02:07:39.679 align:start position:0%
the problem is the intended
 
02:07:41.669 --> 02:07:41.679 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries primarily
 
02:07:45.270 --> 02:07:45.280 align:start position:0%
in the cares act were the employees
 
02:07:48.790 --> 02:07:48.800 align:start position:0%
the purpose was to try to enable
 
02:07:50.229 --> 02:07:50.239 align:start position:0%
businesses to keep people
 
02:07:53.109 --> 02:07:53.119 align:start position:0%
employed and give them the money to do
 
02:07:53.119 --> 02:07:53.510 align:start position:0%
employed and give them the money to do
it

02:07:53.510 --> 02:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:07:56.870 --> 02:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
and of course there is a a
 
02:07:59.669 --> 02:07:59.679 align:start position:0%
direct benefit to the employer as well
 
02:07:59.679 --> 02:08:00.069 align:start position:0%
direct benefit to the employer as well
uh

02:08:00.069 --> 02:08:00.079 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:08:01.830 --> 02:08:01.840 align:start position:0%
to retaining those employees and keeping
 
02:08:03.830 --> 02:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
the doors open and you know
 
02:08:05.589 --> 02:08:05.599 align:start position:0%
i don't think anybody even at the time
 
02:08:07.350 --> 02:08:07.360 align:start position:0%
the cares act was enacted
 
02:08:09.350 --> 02:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
he anticipated the pandemic would endure
 
02:08:10.950 --> 02:08:10.960 align:start position:0%
as long as it has so
 
02:08:12.950 --> 02:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
everybody was sort of viewing it as a
 
02:08:14.790 --> 02:08:14.800 align:start position:0%
short-term opportunity to live to fight
 
02:08:16.310 --> 02:08:16.320 align:start position:0%
another day
 
02:08:18.790 --> 02:08:18.800 align:start position:0%
but when you when you consider who the
 
02:08:20.870 --> 02:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
intended beneficiaries are and then you
 
02:08:22.390 --> 02:08:22.400 align:start position:0%
ask yourself
 
02:08:26.069 --> 02:08:26.079 align:start position:0%
if sb3 passed unamended um
 
02:08:29.189 --> 02:08:29.199 align:start position:0%
who would actually get the benefit
 
02:08:31.109 --> 02:08:31.119 align:start position:0%
the more profitable business was the
 
02:08:33.830 --> 02:08:33.840 align:start position:0%
more they would benefit from sb3
 
02:08:35.750 --> 02:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
the more damage the business was by the
 
02:08:37.350 --> 02:08:37.360 align:start position:0%
pandemic controls the less they'd
 
02:08:37.360 --> 02:08:38.629 align:start position:0%
pandemic controls the less they'd
benefit

02:08:38.629 --> 02:08:38.639 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
02:08:40.629 --> 02:08:40.639 align:start position:0%
non-new hampshire businesses would
 
02:08:42.470 --> 02:08:42.480 align:start position:0%
benefit just as much as new hampshire
 
02:08:44.390 --> 02:08:44.400 align:start position:0%
donald businesses
 
02:08:46.069 --> 02:08:46.079 align:start position:0%
large businesses would benefit more than
 
02:08:47.430 --> 02:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
small businesses
 
02:08:49.430 --> 02:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
and this could include multinationals
 
02:08:51.189 --> 02:08:51.199 align:start position:0%
and foreign companies that often receive
 
02:08:51.199 --> 02:08:51.910 align:start position:0%
and foreign companies that often receive
ppp

02:08:51.910 --> 02:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
ppp
 
02:08:53.830 --> 02:08:53.840 align:start position:0%
through smaller us-based subsidiaries or
 
02:08:55.669 --> 02:08:55.679 align:start position:0%
related entities
 
02:08:59.750 --> 02:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
so and incidentally if we were
 
02:09:01.350 --> 02:09:01.360 align:start position:0%
at the point where we were implementing
 
02:09:02.950 --> 02:09:02.960 align:start position:0%
a single sales factor all of
 
02:09:05.589 --> 02:09:05.599 align:start position:0%
that would just be amplified greatly
 
02:09:07.430 --> 02:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
because we'd be relying more heavily on
 
02:09:09.350 --> 02:09:09.360 align:start position:0%
non-new hampshire companies sales within
 
02:09:11.030 --> 02:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
the state
 
02:09:14.709 --> 02:09:14.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:17.750 --> 02:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
the more we consider this
 
02:09:21.830 --> 02:09:21.840 align:start position:0%
the bill is a very blunt instrument i
 
02:09:24.870 --> 02:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
i think i think that uh
 
02:09:28.390 --> 02:09:28.400 align:start position:0%
the complaints on
 
02:09:30.709 --> 02:09:30.719 align:start position:0%
on their surface are appealing if
 
02:09:32.310 --> 02:09:32.320 align:start position:0%
somebody were actually
 
02:09:38.069 --> 02:09:38.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:40.390 --> 02:09:40.400 align:start position:0%
incrementally more than they you know
 
02:09:41.589 --> 02:09:41.599 align:start position:0%
than the profits
 
02:09:43.750 --> 02:09:43.760 align:start position:0%
that they would have earned otherwise i
 
02:09:45.510 --> 02:09:45.520 align:start position:0%
can see how businesses would complain
 
02:09:46.790 --> 02:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
that it's a harm
 
02:09:48.790 --> 02:09:48.800 align:start position:0%
but i think much of this i used the term
 
02:09:50.870 --> 02:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
illusion in in one of my questions in
 
02:09:52.709 --> 02:09:52.719 align:start position:0%
the hearing i think
 
02:09:56.629 --> 02:09:56.639 align:start position:0%
that the the fear and the concern
 
02:10:01.990 --> 02:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:04.550 --> 02:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
if if you've completely offset all of
 
02:10:06.229 --> 02:10:06.239 align:start position:0%
your ppp funds
 
02:10:08.870 --> 02:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
with qualified expenses there is no
 
02:10:12.709 --> 02:10:12.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:14.790 --> 02:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
so i think there are probably other ways
 
02:10:16.149 --> 02:10:16.159 align:start position:0%
if if we believe
 
02:10:19.030 --> 02:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
politically that there are small
 
02:10:20.870 --> 02:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
businesses and independent businesses
 
02:10:22.470 --> 02:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
that continue to struggle there are
 
02:10:24.790 --> 02:10:24.800 align:start position:0%
other ways to assist them more
 
02:10:26.790 --> 02:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
effectively than this
 
02:10:30.709 --> 02:10:30.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:34.390 --> 02:10:34.400 align:start position:0%
okay could i just ask would you
 
02:10:37.990 --> 02:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
regard on applying
 
02:10:42.069 --> 02:10:42.079 align:start position:0%
the the newer federal requirement that
 
02:10:45.589 --> 02:10:45.599 align:start position:0%
they have lost 25
 
02:10:49.990 --> 02:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
of their revenue during the pandemic
 
02:10:57.990 --> 02:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:59.990 --> 02:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
let's see i'm trying to think through
 
02:11:02.709 --> 02:11:02.719 align:start position:0%
how that squares with what this bill
 
02:11:05.669 --> 02:11:05.679 align:start position:0%
um is trying to do and what the
 
02:11:07.990 --> 02:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
amendment is trying to do
 
02:11:11.910 --> 02:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
um if they lost 25 of their business
 
02:11:13.430 --> 02:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
are they a profitable business
 
02:11:15.669 --> 02:11:15.679 align:start position:0%
sufficiently profitable
 
02:11:19.189 --> 02:11:19.199 align:start position:0%
to exceed the threshold and be taxed
 
02:11:21.270 --> 02:11:21.280 align:start position:0%
under the bpt
 
02:11:25.189 --> 02:11:25.199 align:start position:0%
but they'd be they'd have lost it for
 
02:11:33.350 --> 02:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:35.589 --> 02:11:35.599 align:start position:0%
okay i'm i'm not sure how this puts more
 
02:11:37.589 --> 02:11:37.599 align:start position:0%
money in their hands but i may be
 
02:11:40.950 --> 02:11:40.960 align:start position:0%
not seen this way uh
 
02:11:42.229 --> 02:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
we're going to be discussing this again
 
02:11:44.790 --> 02:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
tomorrow uh so
 
02:11:46.550 --> 02:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
maybe you can think about that uh
 
02:11:47.910 --> 02:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
representative spillsberry
 
02:11:49.589 --> 02:11:49.599 align:start position:0%
and maybe sure you have a chance to
 
02:11:50.950 --> 02:11:50.960 align:start position:0%
react to that okay
 
02:11:54.069 --> 02:11:54.079 align:start position:0%
glad to thank you representative
 
02:11:59.270 --> 02:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:02.950 --> 02:12:02.960 align:start position:0%
yeah i i i think the um exchange that
 
02:12:04.470 --> 02:12:04.480 align:start position:0%
just occurred
 
02:12:07.990 --> 02:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
really addresses my concerns i i uh
 
02:12:10.870 --> 02:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
i think the multi-year situation that
 
02:12:10.880 --> 02:12:11.510 align:start position:0%
i think the multi-year situation that
the

02:12:11.510 --> 02:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:12:14.709 --> 02:12:14.719 align:start position:0%
expenses occurred in the first year and
 
02:12:14.719 --> 02:12:15.350 align:start position:0%
expenses occurred in the first year and
then

02:12:15.350 --> 02:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:12:18.149 --> 02:12:18.159 align:start position:0%
in the second year the loans forgiven
 
02:12:18.159 --> 02:12:18.870 align:start position:0%
in the second year the loans forgiven
are

02:12:18.870 --> 02:12:18.880 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:12:21.910 --> 02:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
the situations that sort of pose
 
02:12:25.109 --> 02:12:25.119 align:start position:0%
the trickiest uh um
 
02:12:28.390 --> 02:12:28.400 align:start position:0%
situation to announce to to understand
 
02:12:28.400 --> 02:12:28.790 align:start position:0%
situation to announce to to understand
and

02:12:28.790 --> 02:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:12:31.990 --> 02:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
to assess but uh in one year
 
02:12:35.109 --> 02:12:35.119 align:start position:0%
a uh business let's say a pretty
 
02:12:39.109 --> 02:12:39.119 align:start position:0%
big restaurant um
 
02:12:42.790 --> 02:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
survives by by having that loan that
 
02:12:46.390 --> 02:12:46.400 align:start position:0%
pays for the salaries of the staff that
 
02:12:49.990 --> 02:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
uh that enable the restaurant to
 
02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:50.709 align:start position:0%
uh that enable the restaurant to
continue

02:12:50.709 --> 02:12:50.719 align:start position:0%
continue
 
02:12:54.790 --> 02:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
operating and they do receive revenue
 
02:12:58.310 --> 02:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
um about equal to
 
02:13:01.030 --> 02:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
this the cost of keeping the business
 
02:13:01.040 --> 02:13:03.830 align:start position:0%
this the cost of keeping the business
open

02:13:03.830 --> 02:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
open
 
02:13:06.229 --> 02:13:06.239 align:start position:0%
and so they come out of that year and
 
02:13:08.470 --> 02:13:08.480 align:start position:0%
they file their return
 
02:13:11.430 --> 02:13:11.440 align:start position:0%
let's say they they even get some some
 
02:13:13.750 --> 02:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
profit so they have to file a return
 
02:13:16.069 --> 02:13:16.079 align:start position:0%
they're above the threshold or maybe
 
02:13:18.550 --> 02:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
they don't file a return
 
02:13:21.669 --> 02:13:21.679 align:start position:0%
and and then in the second year in the
 
02:13:24.310 --> 02:13:24.320 align:start position:0%
next year the loan's forgiven
 
02:13:27.030 --> 02:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
and under this amendment now the those
 
02:13:27.040 --> 02:13:27.750 align:start position:0%
and under this amendment now the those
expenses

02:13:27.750 --> 02:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
expenses
 
02:13:29.910 --> 02:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
they took in the previous year as i
 
02:13:31.750 --> 02:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
understand it maybe i'm misunderstanding
 
02:13:31.760 --> 02:13:33.430 align:start position:0%
understand it maybe i'm misunderstanding
it

02:13:33.430 --> 02:13:33.440 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:13:36.709 --> 02:13:36.719 align:start position:0%
would now no longer be deductible
 
02:13:41.189 --> 02:13:41.199 align:start position:0%
so they'd have to file an amended return
 
02:13:45.189 --> 02:13:45.199 align:start position:0%
and have a tax liability for that
 
02:13:47.430 --> 02:13:47.440 align:start position:0%
previous year
 
02:13:50.550 --> 02:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
or am i misunderstanding um
 
02:13:52.870 --> 02:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
and now they go forward and the loan is
 
02:13:52.880 --> 02:13:54.629 align:start position:0%
and now they go forward and the loan is
not

02:13:54.629 --> 02:13:54.639 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:13:57.189 --> 02:13:57.199 align:start position:0%
in the in the new tax year the loan is
 
02:13:59.750 --> 02:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
is not revenue so that's good
 
02:14:02.629 --> 02:14:02.639 align:start position:0%
um and there are no expenses related to
 
02:14:03.910 --> 02:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
the loan
 
02:14:07.030 --> 02:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
um so they go forward
 
02:14:10.229 --> 02:14:10.239 align:start position:0%
and but they've got to they've now
 
02:14:11.990 --> 02:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
they've got a tax liability
 
02:14:14.870 --> 02:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
that relates to that first year that may
 
02:14:18.310 --> 02:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:19.990 --> 02:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
i think you're raised in an interesting
 
02:14:22.149 --> 02:14:22.159 align:start position:0%
question uh representative
 
02:14:23.430 --> 02:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
ames and i want to think about it
 
02:14:24.950 --> 02:14:24.960 align:start position:0%
further and i think we need to hear the
 
02:14:24.960 --> 02:14:26.390 align:start position:0%
further and i think we need to hear the
dras

02:14:26.390 --> 02:14:26.400 align:start position:0%
dras
 
02:14:29.109 --> 02:14:29.119 align:start position:0%
assessment of that but just to be clear
 
02:14:29.119 --> 02:14:30.229 align:start position:0%
assessment of that but just to be clear
uh

02:14:30.229 --> 02:14:30.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:14:33.030 --> 02:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
the ppp initially is alone so there's no
 
02:14:33.040 --> 02:14:34.229 align:start position:0%
the ppp initially is alone so there's no
income

02:14:34.229 --> 02:14:34.239 align:start position:0%
income
 
02:14:37.750 --> 02:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
right and and and i think you you uh
 
02:14:39.830 --> 02:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
you may be right that the forgiveness
 
02:14:41.750 --> 02:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
might occur in a different
 
02:14:44.790 --> 02:14:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:47.910 --> 02:14:47.920 align:start position:0%
so now the income is
 
02:14:51.270 --> 02:14:51.280 align:start position:0%
created but under sb3
 
02:14:54.709 --> 02:14:54.719 align:start position:0%
as with the cares act gets excluded from
 
02:14:57.109 --> 02:14:57.119 align:start position:0%
taxation so your question is the timing
 
02:14:58.310 --> 02:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
of the
 
02:15:01.270 --> 02:15:01.280 align:start position:0%
expenses that were deducted and
 
02:15:02.950 --> 02:15:02.960 align:start position:0%
specifically we're speaking of those
 
02:15:05.270 --> 02:15:05.280 align:start position:0%
expenses that were identified in the
 
02:15:05.990 --> 02:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
process of
 
02:15:08.950 --> 02:15:08.960 align:start position:0%
qualifying the ppp loan for forgiveness
 
02:15:11.189 --> 02:15:11.199 align:start position:0%
did they occur in the same tax year as
 
02:15:13.669 --> 02:15:13.679 align:start position:0%
the forgiveness i haven't thought about
 
02:15:15.510 --> 02:15:15.520 align:start position:0%
that previously it's a great question
 
02:15:19.350 --> 02:15:19.360 align:start position:0%
need some thought okay thank you
 
02:15:21.189 --> 02:15:21.199 align:start position:0%
carolyn can you think about that a few
 
02:15:22.470 --> 02:15:22.480 align:start position:0%
minutes i'm going to go to
 
02:15:24.950 --> 02:15:24.960 align:start position:0%
representative danigan and if you can
 
02:15:26.870 --> 02:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
just weigh in on that
 
02:15:29.830 --> 02:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
last interchange uh but representative
 
02:15:31.750 --> 02:15:31.760 align:start position:0%
genegan first
 
02:15:34.550 --> 02:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i guess my question's
 
02:15:36.390 --> 02:15:36.400 align:start position:0%
more to make sure i understand
 
02:15:39.910 --> 02:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
the amendment fully because i want to
 
02:15:41.430 --> 02:15:41.440 align:start position:0%
and i want to use an example to make
 
02:15:43.030 --> 02:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
sure that i understand it
 
02:15:45.589 --> 02:15:45.599 align:start position:0%
and that is if you have let's say your
 
02:15:45.599 --> 02:15:46.229 align:start position:0%
and that is if you have let's say your
ppp

02:15:46.229 --> 02:15:46.239 align:start position:0%
ppp
 
02:15:49.430 --> 02:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
loan is forgiven and that pp
 
02:15:52.550 --> 02:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
loan represents one half of your
 
02:15:55.990 --> 02:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
of your gross income now so it's it's
 
02:15:57.510 --> 02:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
now on half but were you saying the
 
02:15:57.520 --> 02:15:58.069 align:start position:0%
now on half but were you saying the
amendment

02:15:58.069 --> 02:15:58.079 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:16:01.189 --> 02:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
that the um that the the um
 
02:16:02.790 --> 02:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
there's there can't be any adjusted
 
02:16:04.709 --> 02:16:04.719 align:start position:0%
basis for expenses
 
02:16:06.950 --> 02:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
does that mean none of the expenses i
 
02:16:08.790 --> 02:16:08.800 align:start position:0%
mean i would expect half my expenses to
 
02:16:11.430 --> 02:16:11.440 align:start position:0%
be deductible now because half my income
 
02:16:14.229 --> 02:16:14.239 align:start position:0%
was not from ppp but the way that
 
02:16:15.750 --> 02:16:15.760 align:start position:0%
amendment is worded it sounds like i
 
02:16:17.589 --> 02:16:17.599 align:start position:0%
can't deduct any of my expenses
 
02:16:19.589 --> 02:16:19.599 align:start position:0%
is that true or am i misunderstanding
 
02:16:21.109 --> 02:16:21.119 align:start position:0%
something there
 
02:16:25.109 --> 02:16:25.119 align:start position:0%
yeah um i i'm going to ask the dra to
 
02:16:27.189 --> 02:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
confirm this but my understanding of the
 
02:16:29.669 --> 02:16:29.679 align:start position:0%
usage of the term basis
 
02:16:32.790 --> 02:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
has to do with the adjustments for
 
02:16:35.589 --> 02:16:35.599 align:start position:0%
capital items and that sort of thing
 
02:16:38.790 --> 02:16:38.800 align:start position:0%
so know that the first clause no
 
02:16:38.800 --> 02:16:39.429 align:start position:0%
so know that the first clause no
deduction

02:16:39.429 --> 02:16:39.439 align:start position:0%
deduction
 
02:16:43.669 --> 02:16:43.679 align:start position:0%
shall be allowed relates to the
 
02:16:47.190 --> 02:16:47.200 align:start position:0%
deductions of current expense dot dot
 
02:16:47.200 --> 02:16:49.110 align:start position:0%
deductions of current expense dot dot
dot

02:16:49.110 --> 02:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
dot
 
02:16:50.950 --> 02:16:50.960 align:start position:0%
if the payment at the expense results in
 
02:16:53.190 --> 02:16:53.200 align:start position:0%
forgiveness and the income associated
 
02:16:55.110 --> 02:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
with forgiveness is excluded from gross
 
02:16:57.910 --> 02:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
business income so i i believe the
 
02:16:59.990 --> 02:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
answer to your question is no that's not
 
02:17:02.790 --> 02:17:02.800 align:start position:0%
an issue we're conflating two things but
 
02:17:04.469 --> 02:17:04.479 align:start position:0%
i would want the dra to confirm that
 
02:17:06.150 --> 02:17:06.160 align:start position:0%
i've got that right
 
02:17:08.549 --> 02:17:08.559 align:start position:0%
i definitely want to be sure yes thank
 
02:17:08.559 --> 02:17:10.629 align:start position:0%
i definitely want to be sure yes thank
you

02:17:10.629 --> 02:17:10.639 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:17:13.990 --> 02:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
um carolyn can you weigh in
 
02:17:18.309 --> 02:17:18.319 align:start position:0%
on both of those last uh conversations
 
02:17:20.070 --> 02:17:20.080 align:start position:0%
sure i'll start with the last question
 
02:17:21.429 --> 02:17:21.439 align:start position:0%
because that's the one that's fresh in
 
02:17:22.469 --> 02:17:22.479 align:start position:0%
my mind
 
02:17:26.469 --> 02:17:26.479 align:start position:0%
um so the
 
02:17:29.429 --> 02:17:29.439 align:start position:0%
the first clause no deductions shall be
 
02:17:31.429 --> 02:17:31.439 align:start position:0%
allowed no tax attribute shall be
 
02:17:33.110 --> 02:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
adjusted and no basis
 
02:17:36.389 --> 02:17:36.399 align:start position:0%
shall be adjusted for an expense
 
02:17:39.830 --> 02:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
that is otherwise deductible so all
 
02:17:43.030 --> 02:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
three items deductions tax attributes
 
02:17:47.030 --> 02:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
and basis relate to expenses
 
02:17:48.790 --> 02:17:48.800 align:start position:0%
a deduction is a deduction a tax
 
02:17:50.309 --> 02:17:50.319 align:start position:0%
attribute is
 
02:17:52.950 --> 02:17:52.960 align:start position:0%
for example a net operating loss which
 
02:17:54.150 --> 02:17:54.160 align:start position:0%
is contributed to
 
02:17:57.830 --> 02:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
through the use of expenses and basis
 
02:18:00.870 --> 02:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
is again a capital contribution
 
02:18:04.629 --> 02:18:04.639 align:start position:0%
that is reflected in expenses so
 
02:18:08.070 --> 02:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
the limitation on deductions tax
 
02:18:11.990 --> 02:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
attributes and basis adjustments relates
 
02:18:15.349 --> 02:18:15.359 align:start position:0%
directly to expenses that would be
 
02:18:15.359 --> 02:18:17.429 align:start position:0%
directly to expenses that would be
deductible

02:18:17.429 --> 02:18:17.439 align:start position:0%
deductible
 
02:18:20.389 --> 02:18:20.399 align:start position:0%
but will not be deductible because used
 
02:18:24.790 --> 02:18:24.800 align:start position:0%
to qualify for forgiveness
 
02:18:26.469 --> 02:18:26.479 align:start position:0%
so it's it's really it's not i guess in
 
02:18:28.230 --> 02:18:28.240 align:start position:0%
your example it's
 
02:18:31.270 --> 02:18:31.280 align:start position:0%
the 50 um
 
02:18:33.990 --> 02:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
that were you were paid for with ppp and
 
02:18:35.190 --> 02:18:35.200 align:start position:0%
not the 100
 
02:18:39.669 --> 02:18:39.679 align:start position:0%
of your expenses that will be prohibited
 
02:18:42.549 --> 02:18:42.559 align:start position:0%
representative or uh representative
 
02:18:42.559 --> 02:18:44.150 align:start position:0%
representative or uh representative
spellsbury

02:18:44.150 --> 02:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
spellsbury
 
02:18:46.549 --> 02:18:46.559 align:start position:0%
yes if i may thank you mr chief i may
 
02:18:47.270 --> 02:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
follow up so
 
02:18:49.830 --> 02:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
so basically you are confirming that
 
02:18:50.950 --> 02:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
that 50
 
02:18:53.429 --> 02:18:53.439 align:start position:0%
of the expenses in my example would be
 
02:18:55.270 --> 02:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
allowed to be deducted
 
02:18:55.280 --> 02:18:58.549 align:start position:0%
allowed to be deducted
correct

02:18:58.549 --> 02:18:58.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:01.750 --> 02:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
02:19:03.349 --> 02:19:03.359 align:start position:0%
yes and i think that's consistent you
 
02:19:04.950 --> 02:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
may recall during the hearing
 
02:19:07.589 --> 02:19:07.599 align:start position:0%
uh the question or an answer exchange
 
02:19:09.270 --> 02:19:09.280 align:start position:0%
came up where we were talking about
 
02:19:13.030 --> 02:19:13.040 align:start position:0%
to the extent that i think this language
 
02:19:16.389 --> 02:19:16.399 align:start position:0%
makes it clear it's only that only those
 
02:19:21.429 --> 02:19:21.439 align:start position:0%
that qualified for the forgiveness
 
02:19:24.629 --> 02:19:24.639 align:start position:0%
okay and then the conversation before
 
02:19:27.030 --> 02:19:27.040 align:start position:0%
it was a specific question i can't
 
02:19:27.040 --> 02:19:27.750 align:start position:0%
it was a specific question i can't
remember

02:19:27.750 --> 02:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
remember
 
02:19:27.760 --> 02:19:32.870 align:start position:0%
remember
myself

02:19:32.870 --> 02:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:35.509 --> 02:19:35.519 align:start position:0%
carolyn um yeah i think the question
 
02:19:36.870 --> 02:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
before related to
 
02:19:40.070 --> 02:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
whether there was a potential issue
 
02:19:44.070 --> 02:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
with the expenses being incurred in one
 
02:19:44.080 --> 02:19:44.950 align:start position:0%
with the expenses being incurred in one
year

02:19:44.950 --> 02:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
year
 
02:19:48.150 --> 02:19:48.160 align:start position:0%
and the forgiveness in a second year and
 
02:19:50.550 --> 02:19:50.560 align:start position:0%
i think this is an area where
 
02:19:54.070 --> 02:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
we'll all be helped by the testimony of
 
02:19:55.190 --> 02:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
the cpas
 
02:19:58.710 --> 02:19:58.720 align:start position:0%
tomorrow because
 
02:20:02.550 --> 02:20:02.560 align:start position:0%
our expectation has been
 
02:20:06.070 --> 02:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
that taxpayers were going to be treating
 
02:20:09.429 --> 02:20:09.439 align:start position:0%
ppp loans as forgiven
 
02:20:12.309 --> 02:20:12.319 align:start position:0%
um in the same year that the expenses
 
02:20:13.510 --> 02:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
were incurred
 
02:20:15.349 --> 02:20:15.359 align:start position:0%
and this is primarily due to some
 
02:20:18.070 --> 02:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
guidance that the irs had previously
 
02:20:20.710 --> 02:20:20.720 align:start position:0%
issued saying that taxpayers should
 
02:20:20.720 --> 02:20:21.190 align:start position:0%
issued saying that taxpayers should
treat

02:20:21.190 --> 02:20:21.200 align:start position:0%
treat
 
02:20:25.270 --> 02:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
ppp loans um as forgiven
 
02:20:27.190 --> 02:20:27.200 align:start position:0%
if they reasonably believed that they
 
02:20:29.030 --> 02:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
would be forgiven
 
02:20:33.190 --> 02:20:33.200 align:start position:0%
in the following tax year but i think
 
02:20:35.750 --> 02:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
taxpayers may have treated it
 
02:20:35.760 --> 02:20:36.630 align:start position:0%
taxpayers may have treated it
differently

02:20:36.630 --> 02:20:36.640 align:start position:0%
differently
 
02:20:40.230 --> 02:20:40.240 align:start position:0%
may not have relied on that irs guidance
 
02:20:43.349 --> 02:20:43.359 align:start position:0%
and so i think the
 
02:20:45.990 --> 02:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
uh testimony will be helpful tomorrow
 
02:20:47.670 --> 02:20:47.680 align:start position:0%
but ultimately i think
 
02:20:49.990 --> 02:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
you probably have taxpayers doing a lot
 
02:20:51.670 --> 02:20:51.680 align:start position:0%
of different things
 
02:20:55.510 --> 02:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
um on their returns with these items of
 
02:21:01.110 --> 02:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:05.110 --> 02:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
does that help everybody okay
 
02:21:09.190 --> 02:21:09.200 align:start position:0%
thank you so what does that mean
 
02:21:13.590 --> 02:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
yeah in response to that one i wanted to
 
02:21:15.830 --> 02:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
make sure that
 
02:21:19.110 --> 02:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
they the cpas
 
02:21:22.070 --> 02:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
know that we'd like to know whether
 
02:21:22.080 --> 02:21:22.950 align:start position:0%
know that we'd like to know whether
they've

02:21:22.950 --> 02:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
they've
 
02:21:25.990 --> 02:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
been the majority of them have been
 
02:21:28.230 --> 02:21:28.240 align:start position:0%
forgiven yet or not it sounds like the
 
02:21:28.240 --> 02:21:29.190 align:start position:0%
forgiven yet or not it sounds like the
majority

02:21:29.190 --> 02:21:29.200 align:start position:0%
majority
 
02:21:31.349 --> 02:21:31.359 align:start position:0%
haven't been forgiven yet because it was
 
02:21:33.429 --> 02:21:33.439 align:start position:0%
so complicated for the banks to figure
 
02:21:35.110 --> 02:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
out how to send something
 
02:21:39.670 --> 02:21:39.680 align:start position:0%
to the sba and
 
02:21:44.389 --> 02:21:44.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:47.429 --> 02:21:47.439 align:start position:0%
the question is going to be whether
 
02:21:50.710 --> 02:21:50.720 align:start position:0%
on the forgiven loans are going to be
 
02:21:50.720 --> 02:21:51.990 align:start position:0%
on the forgiven loans are going to be
forgiven

02:21:51.990 --> 02:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
forgiven
 
02:21:55.030 --> 02:21:55.040 align:start position:0%
by august which is the latest
 
02:21:58.150 --> 02:21:58.160 align:start position:0%
that we can take this money back
 
02:22:02.469 --> 02:22:02.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:06.230 --> 02:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
or or whether we'll be dealing with
 
02:22:09.670 --> 02:22:09.680 align:start position:0%
refunds in after august which would
 
02:22:13.670 --> 02:22:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:16.950 --> 02:22:16.960 align:start position:0%
and then i also wanted to to say to
 
02:22:18.630 --> 02:22:18.640 align:start position:0%
representative genigean
 
02:22:22.230 --> 02:22:22.240 align:start position:0%
that that the discussion that we just
 
02:22:23.110 --> 02:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
had about
 
02:22:26.550 --> 02:22:26.560 align:start position:0%
whether the 50 is okay or not
 
02:22:30.389 --> 02:22:30.399 align:start position:0%
is in line 17 in the original bill and
 
02:22:32.230 --> 02:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
also in the amendment
 
02:22:34.550 --> 02:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
gross business income provided by
 
02:22:34.560 --> 02:22:35.270 align:start position:0%
gross business income provided by
paragraph

02:22:35.270 --> 02:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
paragraph
 
02:22:41.590 --> 02:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:43.990 --> 02:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
okay i agree i think that very much
 
02:22:45.910 --> 02:22:45.920 align:start position:0%
limits the identity of the specific
 
02:22:50.070 --> 02:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
expenses in question okay
 
02:22:51.590 --> 02:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
so the only other thing i'd like to do
 
02:22:53.190 --> 02:22:53.200 align:start position:0%
here is uh carolyn
 
02:22:57.110 --> 02:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
um you were gonna continue to do some
 
02:22:58.150 --> 02:22:58.160 align:start position:0%
math for us
 
02:23:01.429 --> 02:23:01.439 align:start position:0%
uh where does that all stand uh with
 
02:23:04.710 --> 02:23:04.720 align:start position:0%
your team
 
02:23:08.070 --> 02:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
sure um so
 
02:23:11.030 --> 02:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
you had asked specifically to for us to
 
02:23:13.510 --> 02:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
come up with the fiscal impact
 
02:23:16.870 --> 02:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
of senate bill 3 presuming that
 
02:23:20.230 --> 02:23:20.240 align:start position:0%
all ppp loans that the federal
 
02:23:21.990 --> 02:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
government had appropriated are
 
02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:22.790 align:start position:0%
government had appropriated are
ultimately

02:23:22.790 --> 02:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
ultimately
 
02:23:27.429 --> 02:23:27.439 align:start position:0%
issued and we have done that analysis
 
02:23:30.630 --> 02:23:30.640 align:start position:0%
and it's roughly
 
02:23:33.429 --> 02:23:33.439 align:start position:0%
90 the fiscal impact is roughly 99
 
02:23:33.439 --> 02:23:34.550 align:start position:0%
90 the fiscal impact is roughly 99
million

02:23:34.550 --> 02:23:34.560 align:start position:0%
million
 
02:23:37.349 --> 02:23:37.359 align:start position:0%
um and also based on the data from the
 
02:23:37.359 --> 02:23:38.070 align:start position:0%
um and also based on the data from the
sba

02:23:38.070 --> 02:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
sba
 
02:23:40.389 --> 02:23:40.399 align:start position:0%
it does in fact look like they will
 
02:23:40.399 --> 02:23:41.110 align:start position:0%
it does in fact look like they will
ultimately

02:23:41.110 --> 02:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
ultimately
 
02:23:43.510 --> 02:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
exhaust that appropriation by the end of
 
02:23:45.510 --> 02:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
the month
 
02:23:47.349 --> 02:23:47.359 align:start position:0%
okay so what you did is you did it to
 
02:23:48.550 --> 02:23:48.560 align:start position:0%
the uh all
 
02:23:50.550 --> 02:23:50.560 align:start position:0%
all loans went out all the the money
 
02:23:51.750 --> 02:23:51.760 align:start position:0%
that we had to loan
 
02:23:54.630 --> 02:23:54.640 align:start position:0%
uh or the the feds had to loan new
 
02:23:57.030 --> 02:23:57.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire businesses
 
02:24:00.870 --> 02:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
did occur correct right
 
02:24:02.950 --> 02:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
and you use your same assumptions about
 
02:24:04.630 --> 02:24:04.640 align:start position:0%
uh like it seems like it's
 
02:24:07.750 --> 02:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
pretty close to 100 of being forgiven
 
02:24:11.270 --> 02:24:11.280 align:start position:0%
is that correct so to date for those
 
02:24:15.990 --> 02:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
um those applications that the sba has
 
02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:17.110 align:start position:0%
um those applications that the sba has
processed

02:24:17.110 --> 02:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
processed
 
02:24:19.270 --> 02:24:19.280 align:start position:0%
it's very close to a hundred percent
 
02:24:20.950 --> 02:24:20.960 align:start position:0%
being forgiven
 
02:24:24.230 --> 02:24:24.240 align:start position:0%
okay all right so
 
02:24:26.230 --> 02:24:26.240 align:start position:0%
uh is there something in uh writing you
 
02:24:30.550 --> 02:24:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:34.070 --> 02:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
sure we can do that okay right
 
02:24:37.110 --> 02:24:37.120 align:start position:0%
so you'll be joining us tomorrow correct
 
02:24:38.710 --> 02:24:38.720 align:start position:0%
that's that's correct we'll be on
 
02:24:38.720 --> 02:24:40.830 align:start position:0%
that's that's correct we'll be on
tomorrow

02:24:40.830 --> 02:24:40.840 align:start position:0%
tomorrow
 
02:24:44.950 --> 02:24:44.960 align:start position:0%
susan yeah mr chairman i think that
 
02:24:48.230 --> 02:24:48.240 align:start position:0%
the problem is that a lot of the bank
 
02:24:50.630 --> 02:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
paperwork for forgiveness hasn't gone
 
02:24:52.070 --> 02:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
forward yet and we don't know what
 
02:24:53.750 --> 02:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
percentage of that is never going to go
 
02:24:55.429 --> 02:24:55.439 align:start position:0%
forward because they figured out they
 
02:24:55.990 --> 02:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be
 
02:24:56.000 --> 02:24:59.270 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be
forgiven

02:24:59.270 --> 02:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:02.550 --> 02:25:02.560 align:start position:0%
but this is a good maximum
 
02:25:04.309 --> 02:25:04.319 align:start position:0%
well it's the maximum amount that's
 
02:25:05.590 --> 02:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
going to go out
 
02:25:08.870 --> 02:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
so i'll be to be forgiven so
 
02:25:12.550 --> 02:25:12.560 align:start position:0%
all right uh representative southworth
 
02:25:15.349 --> 02:25:15.359 align:start position:0%
uh thank you i think we should use the
 
02:25:16.630 --> 02:25:16.640 align:start position:0%
maximum um
 
02:25:18.550 --> 02:25:18.560 align:start position:0%
i'm on the board of an agency who used
 
02:25:18.560 --> 02:25:19.830 align:start position:0%
i'm on the board of an agency who used
ppp

02:25:19.830 --> 02:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
ppp
 
02:25:21.830 --> 02:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
and every month we'd meet and we go
 
02:25:23.910 --> 02:25:23.920 align:start position:0%
through the expenses with the bookkeeper
 
02:25:25.590 --> 02:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
and the list from the state
 
02:25:28.710 --> 02:25:28.720 align:start position:0%
and it really wasn't hard to tell yes
 
02:25:30.469 --> 02:25:30.479 align:start position:0%
this counts no this doesn't
 
02:25:31.830 --> 02:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
you know we had a separate line in our
 
02:25:33.990 --> 02:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
budget for all of it and i just suspect
 
02:25:35.830 --> 02:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
that a lot of businesses did that
 
02:25:37.830 --> 02:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
because they wanted to be forgiven and
 
02:25:39.830 --> 02:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
they wanted to be careful
 
02:25:43.590 --> 02:25:43.600 align:start position:0%
right okay all right any more discussion
 
02:25:44.469 --> 02:25:44.479 align:start position:0%
today on this
 
02:25:47.510 --> 02:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
on this bill or the amendment
 
02:25:50.469 --> 02:25:50.479 align:start position:0%
okay i would just and if we were in
 
02:25:52.070 --> 02:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
debate mode there are a lot more things
 
02:25:53.750 --> 02:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
that i could say i could refer back to
 
02:25:55.110 --> 02:25:55.120 align:start position:0%
the discussion about
 
02:25:57.110 --> 02:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
where other states stand income taxes
 
02:25:59.590 --> 02:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
sales taxes the danish analog
 
02:26:01.590 --> 02:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
and on and on but i would just like
 
02:26:04.790 --> 02:26:04.800 align:start position:0%
everybody to really consider
 
02:26:09.110 --> 02:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
even if we let sp3 go through unamended
 
02:26:10.950 --> 02:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
would it really reach the targeted
 
02:26:10.960 --> 02:26:12.790 align:start position:0%
would it really reach the targeted
beneficiaries

02:26:12.790 --> 02:26:12.800 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries
 
02:26:14.870 --> 02:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
and and i think the closer you look at
 
02:26:16.389 --> 02:26:16.399 align:start position:0%
it the money would go in all the wrong
 
02:26:16.399 --> 02:26:19.030 align:start position:0%
it the money would go in all the wrong
directions

02:26:19.030 --> 02:26:19.040 align:start position:0%
directions
 
02:26:20.870 --> 02:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
that would be skewed towards those who
 
02:26:22.389 --> 02:26:22.399 align:start position:0%
don't need it and actually generated
 
02:26:22.399 --> 02:26:23.110 align:start position:0%
don't need it and actually generated
profits

02:26:23.110 --> 02:26:23.120 align:start position:0%
profits
 
02:26:24.710 --> 02:26:24.720 align:start position:0%
and they're only being asked to share
 
02:26:26.469 --> 02:26:26.479 align:start position:0%
7.7 of that with
 
02:26:30.230 --> 02:26:30.240 align:start position:0%
the people of new hampshire okay
 
02:26:33.429 --> 02:26:33.439 align:start position:0%
those are good points uh all right
 
02:26:35.990 --> 02:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
so uh well this is to be continued
 
02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:37.429 align:start position:0%
so uh well this is to be continued
tomorrow

02:26:37.429 --> 02:26:37.439 align:start position:0%
tomorrow
 
02:26:40.790 --> 02:26:40.800 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at the calendar here refresh
 
02:26:42.469 --> 02:26:42.479 align:start position:0%
my memory that someone knows
 
02:26:44.550 --> 02:26:44.560 align:start position:0%
is it is it may 27th that we have to
 
02:26:47.110 --> 02:26:47.120 align:start position:0%
have everything voted out
 
02:26:49.750 --> 02:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
i don't have my calendar in front of me
 
02:26:51.510 --> 02:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
does anybody have a calendar handy to
 
02:26:54.550 --> 02:26:54.560 align:start position:0%
yeah that's correct though so we've got
 
02:26:56.950 --> 02:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
basically three weeks well let's call it
 
02:26:58.710 --> 02:26:58.720 align:start position:0%
two and a half weeks
 
02:27:02.630 --> 02:27:02.640 align:start position:0%
coming next week uh to
 
02:27:05.990 --> 02:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
finalize this one all right so that's
 
02:27:08.070 --> 02:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
what that one says i think norm i think
 
02:27:09.910 --> 02:27:09.920 align:start position:0%
representative major wants to uh
 
02:27:12.389 --> 02:27:12.399 align:start position:0%
start executing some of the other bills
 
02:27:14.550 --> 02:27:14.560 align:start position:0%
uh and this will be held to the end
 
02:27:16.230 --> 02:27:16.240 align:start position:0%
uh we'll probably continue to have
 
02:27:18.150 --> 02:27:18.160 align:start position:0%
conversations on this
 
02:27:21.110 --> 02:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
uh over the next couple of weeks so
 
02:27:22.389 --> 02:27:22.399 align:start position:0%
before we break uh
 
02:27:25.510 --> 02:27:25.520 align:start position:0%
for the day um uh any any other
 
02:27:27.590 --> 02:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
discussion on
 
02:27:31.830 --> 02:27:31.840 align:start position:0%
uh edith tucker it seems to me that it's
 
02:27:33.750 --> 02:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
very important that
 
02:27:36.469 --> 02:27:36.479 align:start position:0%
uh those who really fully understand all
 
02:27:37.990 --> 02:27:38.000 align:start position:0%
the ins and outs
 
02:27:42.830 --> 02:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:45.030 --> 02:27:45.040 align:start position:0%
of businesses
 
02:27:48.790 --> 02:27:48.800 align:start position:0%
mythical businesses perhaps but based on
 
02:27:50.790 --> 02:27:50.800 align:start position:0%
what we know about businesses in new
 
02:27:52.309 --> 02:27:52.319 align:start position:0%
hampshire and how they
 
02:27:54.389 --> 02:27:54.399 align:start position:0%
had to deal with the pandemic and the
 
02:27:56.790 --> 02:27:56.800 align:start position:0%
differences in
 
02:27:59.670 --> 02:27:59.680 align:start position:0%
some really struggling and some not so
 
02:27:59.680 --> 02:28:00.389 align:start position:0%
some really struggling and some not so
that

02:28:00.389 --> 02:28:00.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:28:02.870 --> 02:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
as we're talking about this with the
 
02:28:04.469 --> 02:28:04.479 align:start position:0%
more general public
 
02:28:07.830 --> 02:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
they can understand why it is
 
02:28:12.070 --> 02:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
that there is this concern about
 
02:28:15.110 --> 02:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
if we don't do this something like this
 
02:28:17.990 --> 02:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
the money will go to the wrong not the
 
02:28:19.750 --> 02:28:19.760 align:start position:0%
intended target
 
02:28:21.990 --> 02:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
and i i think those words of
 
02:28:24.070 --> 02:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
representative spillbrees
 
02:28:27.750 --> 02:28:27.760 align:start position:0%
need some kind of examples so that
 
02:28:29.990 --> 02:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
you know we apparently are going to have
 
02:28:32.550 --> 02:28:32.560 align:start position:0%
two or two and a half weeks before
 
02:28:36.230 --> 02:28:36.240 align:start position:0%
this will be voted on there is time for
 
02:28:39.590 --> 02:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
some examples to be made up
 
02:28:42.870 --> 02:28:42.880 align:start position:0%
to explain the difference
 
02:28:46.070 --> 02:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
it's pretty theoretical otherwise and
 
02:28:47.510 --> 02:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of people who are very
 
02:28:51.030 --> 02:28:51.040 align:start position:0%
concerned who are in small businesses
 
02:28:53.590 --> 02:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
well maybe we can have we can ask the
 
02:28:54.950 --> 02:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
accountants to
 
02:28:58.469 --> 02:28:58.479 align:start position:0%
maybe give us some examples tomorrow
 
02:29:02.230 --> 02:29:02.240 align:start position:0%
um and maybe blinding the company that
 
02:29:02.870 --> 02:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
they are
 
02:29:04.550 --> 02:29:04.560 align:start position:0%
dealing with that they can give us a
 
02:29:06.550 --> 02:29:06.560 align:start position:0%
sense of
 
02:29:07.990 --> 02:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
how that math would work for some of
 
02:29:10.790 --> 02:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
these but we can ask we can ask that
 
02:29:10.800 --> 02:29:13.110 align:start position:0%
these but we can ask we can ask that
tomorrow

02:29:13.110 --> 02:29:13.120 align:start position:0%
tomorrow
 
02:29:16.389 --> 02:29:16.399 align:start position:0%
so you could even ask them whether they
 
02:29:18.710 --> 02:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
agree with representative spillsbury
 
02:29:18.720 --> 02:29:19.990 align:start position:0%
agree with representative spillsbury
that

02:29:19.990 --> 02:29:20.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:29:23.590 --> 02:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
from their knowledge
 
02:29:26.710 --> 02:29:26.720 align:start position:0%
the money is heading towards the wrong
 
02:29:29.590 --> 02:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
group of people legitimate question to
 
02:29:29.600 --> 02:29:30.230 align:start position:0%
group of people legitimate question to
ask

02:29:30.230 --> 02:29:30.240 align:start position:0%
ask
 
02:29:31.670 --> 02:29:31.680 align:start position:0%
i think that would be a terrific
 
02:29:33.429 --> 02:29:33.439 align:start position:0%
question right right
 
02:29:36.710 --> 02:29:36.720 align:start position:0%
agreed well tomorrow's the right we have
 
02:29:38.150 --> 02:29:38.160 align:start position:0%
an opportunity we got
 
02:29:41.270 --> 02:29:41.280 align:start position:0%
two of these uh two of these fellows who
 
02:29:41.280 --> 02:29:41.830 align:start position:0%
two of these uh two of these fellows who
uh

02:29:41.830 --> 02:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:29:43.429 --> 02:29:43.439 align:start position:0%
i i've dealt with one of them in the
 
02:29:46.070 --> 02:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
past he's very good
 
02:29:49.349 --> 02:29:49.359 align:start position:0%
so um very knowledgeable on this whole
 
02:29:50.710 --> 02:29:50.720 align:start position:0%
issue of
 
02:29:53.830 --> 02:29:53.840 align:start position:0%
you know taxes and tax returns for
 
02:29:57.670 --> 02:29:57.680 align:start position:0%
businesses uh representative army
 
02:30:00.870 --> 02:30:00.880 align:start position:0%
thank you i just wanted to say that the
 
02:30:02.070 --> 02:30:02.080 align:start position:0%
accountants that
 
02:30:05.590 --> 02:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
have clients that are in the category
 
02:30:10.389 --> 02:30:10.399 align:start position:0%
of uh of profiting a lot off of this
 
02:30:13.429 --> 02:30:13.439 align:start position:0%
on are highly unlikely to think on their
 
02:30:13.439 --> 02:30:15.349 align:start position:0%
on are highly unlikely to think on their
clients

02:30:15.349 --> 02:30:15.359 align:start position:0%
clients
 
02:30:18.469 --> 02:30:18.479 align:start position:0%
we might get good cases for
 
02:30:21.830 --> 02:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
who who really suffers if we don't do
 
02:30:21.840 --> 02:30:22.309 align:start position:0%
who who really suffers if we don't do
this

02:30:22.309 --> 02:30:22.319 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:30:24.150 --> 02:30:24.160 align:start position:0%
but i don't think we're going to get a
 
02:30:25.349 --> 02:30:25.359 align:start position:0%
case for
 
02:30:29.110 --> 02:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
for the ones above it that
 
02:30:33.110 --> 02:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
is anything but a made up on
 
02:30:36.150 --> 02:30:36.160 align:start position:0%
that i don't think we'll get them uh we
 
02:30:36.160 --> 02:30:36.630 align:start position:0%
that i don't think we'll get them uh we
were

02:30:36.630 --> 02:30:36.640 align:start position:0%
were
 
02:30:39.349 --> 02:30:39.359 align:start position:0%
dealing with an issue sort of like the
 
02:30:39.359 --> 02:30:40.070 align:start position:0%
dealing with an issue sort of like the
sensitive

02:30:40.070 --> 02:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
sensitive
 
02:30:41.830 --> 02:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
like this before and the only way we
 
02:30:43.429 --> 02:30:43.439 align:start position:0%
could get some of the accountants to
 
02:30:43.439 --> 02:30:43.830 align:start position:0%
could get some of the accountants to
talk

02:30:43.830 --> 02:30:43.840 align:start position:0%
talk
 
02:30:48.309 --> 02:30:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:51.110 --> 02:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
you're probably right represent mommy
 
02:30:53.429 --> 02:30:53.439 align:start position:0%
the problem also
 
02:30:56.710 --> 02:30:56.720 align:start position:0%
uh to take off from uh representative
 
02:30:57.590 --> 02:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
almi's point
 
02:31:00.309 --> 02:31:00.319 align:start position:0%
is that we hear in hearings from those
 
02:31:01.030 --> 02:31:01.040 align:start position:0%
who are
 
02:31:04.150 --> 02:31:04.160 align:start position:0%
effectively advocating a position
 
02:31:06.550 --> 02:31:06.560 align:start position:0%
and they often speak in generalizations
 
02:31:08.550 --> 02:31:08.560 align:start position:0%
their examples don't get
 
02:31:11.670 --> 02:31:11.680 align:start position:0%
pinned down and backed up with concrete
 
02:31:11.680 --> 02:31:12.469 align:start position:0%
pinned down and backed up with concrete
data

02:31:12.469 --> 02:31:12.479 align:start position:0%
data
 
02:31:15.670 --> 02:31:15.680 align:start position:0%
so the complaints tend to be i exhausted
 
02:31:16.790 --> 02:31:16.800 align:start position:0%
all of my money
 
02:31:19.590 --> 02:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
uh keeping my employees on the job i
 
02:31:21.030 --> 02:31:21.040 align:start position:0%
struggled all year and i'm still
 
02:31:21.040 --> 02:31:21.990 align:start position:0%
struggled all year and i'm still
struggling

02:31:21.990 --> 02:31:22.000 align:start position:0%
struggling
 
02:31:23.910 --> 02:31:23.920 align:start position:0%
i closed my business temporarily and i'm
 
02:31:25.510 --> 02:31:25.520 align:start position:0%
trying to regain momentum
 
02:31:28.070 --> 02:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
but none of those people sound like they
 
02:31:28.080 --> 02:31:28.950 align:start position:0%
but none of those people sound like they
have

02:31:28.950 --> 02:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:31:35.110 --> 02:31:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:40.830 --> 02:31:40.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:40.840 --> 02:31:42.469 align:start position:0%
 
did

02:31:42.469 --> 02:31:42.479 align:start position:0%
did
 
02:31:45.270 --> 02:31:45.280 align:start position:0%
okay any other comments or discussion on
 
02:31:45.280 --> 02:31:46.469 align:start position:0%
okay any other comments or discussion on
this

02:31:46.469 --> 02:31:46.479 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:31:48.710 --> 02:31:48.720 align:start position:0%
all right so to be continued tomorrow uh
 
02:31:49.910 --> 02:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
the only other thing i want to mention
 
02:31:53.030 --> 02:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
is that we was briefly mentioned earlier
 
02:31:56.150 --> 02:31:56.160 align:start position:0%
we we passed uh house bill 565
 
02:31:58.790 --> 02:31:58.800 align:start position:0%
which was the study committee with the
 
02:31:58.800 --> 02:31:59.429 align:start position:0%
which was the study committee with the
senate

02:31:59.429 --> 02:31:59.439 align:start position:0%
senate
 
02:32:02.550 --> 02:32:02.560 align:start position:0%
for charitable gaming uh that
 
02:32:05.990 --> 02:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
that bill uh passed on
 
02:32:09.190 --> 02:32:09.200 align:start position:0%
consent calendar uh
 
02:32:10.790 --> 02:32:10.800 align:start position:0%
but then it no i guess they pulled it
 
02:32:12.230 --> 02:32:12.240 align:start position:0%
off it wasn't on consent because then
 
02:32:12.240 --> 02:32:12.550 align:start position:0%
off it wasn't on consent because then
they

02:32:12.550 --> 02:32:12.560 align:start position:0%
they
 
02:32:15.429 --> 02:32:15.439 align:start position:0%
they they passed it and then they tabled
 
02:32:15.439 --> 02:32:17.030 align:start position:0%
they they passed it and then they tabled
it

02:32:17.030 --> 02:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:32:20.309 --> 02:32:20.319 align:start position:0%
uh now they have their version
 
02:32:23.030 --> 02:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
which is one of the omnibus bills it's
 
02:32:25.110 --> 02:32:25.120 align:start position:0%
senate bill 100
 
02:32:28.550 --> 02:32:28.560 align:start position:0%
part four is
 
02:32:30.230 --> 02:32:30.240 align:start position:0%
the language of the bill is identical
 
02:32:32.309 --> 02:32:32.319 align:start position:0%
with the exception of
 
02:32:35.510 --> 02:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
of a couple of things basically the
 
02:32:36.389 --> 02:32:36.399 align:start position:0%
makeup of the
 
02:32:40.150 --> 02:32:40.160 align:start position:0%
of the uh the committee
 
02:32:43.510 --> 02:32:43.520 align:start position:0%
both say two senators and three three
 
02:32:46.550 --> 02:32:46.560 align:start position:0%
uh representatives but the senate is
 
02:32:49.110 --> 02:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
specific as to where they come from
 
02:32:53.190 --> 02:32:53.200 align:start position:0%
uh which committees they come from so
 
02:32:55.910 --> 02:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
uh we have to cover the hearing next
 
02:32:55.920 --> 02:32:56.710 align:start position:0%
uh we have to cover the hearing next
tuesday

02:32:56.710 --> 02:32:56.720 align:start position:0%
tuesday
 
02:32:59.670 --> 02:32:59.680 align:start position:0%
it's at nine o'clock so not all of us
 
02:33:00.230 --> 02:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
that they
 
02:33:04.469 --> 02:33:04.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:07.590 --> 02:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
legislative administration committee
 
02:33:10.870 --> 02:33:10.880 align:start position:0%
so i did talk to representative ames
 
02:33:13.990 --> 02:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
this morning who's who's uh
 
02:33:16.150 --> 02:33:16.160 align:start position:0%
sponsored senate bill i mean a house
 
02:33:18.790 --> 02:33:18.800 align:start position:0%
bill uh 565
 
02:33:21.429 --> 02:33:21.439 align:start position:0%
and since then uh representative i did
 
02:33:22.070 --> 02:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
talk to
 
02:33:24.469 --> 02:33:24.479 align:start position:0%
representative guida i did get i did
 
02:33:26.630 --> 02:33:26.640 align:start position:0%
track him down this morning
 
02:33:29.510 --> 02:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh he's he doesn't have a feeling either
 
02:33:30.870 --> 02:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
way on this
 
02:33:32.950 --> 02:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
as to what what language we should
 
02:33:32.960 --> 02:33:34.710 align:start position:0%
as to what what language we should
modify

02:33:34.710 --> 02:33:34.720 align:start position:0%
modify
 
02:33:37.670 --> 02:33:37.680 align:start position:0%
uh but uh he suggested that i talk to
 
02:33:39.510 --> 02:33:39.520 align:start position:0%
senator d'alessandro
 
02:33:42.950 --> 02:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
which i will i will do uh see how quick
 
02:33:44.950 --> 02:33:44.960 align:start position:0%
i can track him down
 
02:33:48.070 --> 02:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
uh so uh and then i'll brief if i get
 
02:33:48.710 --> 02:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
him today
 
02:33:51.030 --> 02:33:51.040 align:start position:0%
i'll i'll brief everybody tomorrow uh
 
02:33:53.190 --> 02:33:53.200 align:start position:0%
about this again
 
02:33:58.070 --> 02:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
uh you know and it's the senate
 
02:34:00.309 --> 02:34:00.319 align:start position:0%
representative ames his concern is that
 
02:34:03.510 --> 02:34:03.520 align:start position:0%
he prefer to see this as a house bill
 
02:34:07.510 --> 02:34:07.520 align:start position:0%
uh and that the odds are if it's a house
 
02:34:08.870 --> 02:34:08.880 align:start position:0%
bill that the chair will probably be
 
02:34:10.710 --> 02:34:10.720 align:start position:0%
from the house
 
02:34:14.150 --> 02:34:14.160 align:start position:0%
uh and that uh we
 
02:34:18.070 --> 02:34:18.080 align:start position:0%
better we probably be more comprehensive
 
02:34:21.030 --> 02:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
uh being being this committee being run
 
02:34:22.630 --> 02:34:22.640 align:start position:0%
by us
 
02:34:26.790 --> 02:34:26.800 align:start position:0%
so um so but anyway i i'll be talking to
 
02:34:26.800 --> 02:34:27.990 align:start position:0%
so um so but anyway i i'll be talking to
the

02:34:27.990 --> 02:34:28.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:34:30.230 --> 02:34:30.240 align:start position:0%
uh senator alessandro who's the prime
 
02:34:31.429 --> 02:34:31.439 align:start position:0%
sponsor of
 
02:34:35.429 --> 02:34:35.439 align:start position:0%
the senate version um just to see
 
02:34:37.349 --> 02:34:37.359 align:start position:0%
how much flexibility is the reason i
 
02:34:38.710 --> 02:34:38.720 align:start position:0%
want to do this now well first we have
 
02:34:40.710 --> 02:34:40.720 align:start position:0%
to testify on
 
02:34:43.429 --> 02:34:43.439 align:start position:0%
i mean the testimony is yes we we
 
02:34:43.990 --> 02:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
already passed
 
02:34:47.349 --> 02:34:47.359 align:start position:0%
this uh and do we want to do we want to
 
02:34:48.870 --> 02:34:48.880 align:start position:0%
offer an amendment
 
02:34:52.870 --> 02:34:52.880 align:start position:0%
to modify the makeup of of the committee
 
02:34:57.349 --> 02:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
uh again they're very specific
 
02:34:59.429 --> 02:34:59.439 align:start position:0%
my thought was that you know what the
 
02:35:01.030 --> 02:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
compromise should be the senate picks
 
02:35:02.389 --> 02:35:02.399 align:start position:0%
the people they want
 
02:35:03.990 --> 02:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
and the house should pick the people we
 
02:35:05.590 --> 02:35:05.600 align:start position:0%
want so
 
02:35:07.110 --> 02:35:07.120 align:start position:0%
in terms of which committees they come
 
02:35:08.950 --> 02:35:08.960 align:start position:0%
from so
 
02:35:11.910 --> 02:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
um and i think i think senator
 
02:35:14.230 --> 02:35:14.240 align:start position:0%
d'alessandro will agree to that
 
02:35:18.230 --> 02:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
and uh so so that's just an update on
 
02:35:19.030 --> 02:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
that one
 
02:35:22.870 --> 02:35:22.880 align:start position:0%
um and if i could yes
 
02:35:26.630 --> 02:35:26.640 align:start position:0%
i sat in on that hearing
 
02:35:30.389 --> 02:35:30.399 align:start position:0%
and senator they tabled it because
 
02:35:34.150 --> 02:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
on senator d'allesandro really wanted
 
02:35:37.190 --> 02:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
to have someone from finance and someone
 
02:35:39.270 --> 02:35:39.280 align:start position:0%
from ways and beans
 
02:35:42.710 --> 02:35:42.720 align:start position:0%
on both
 
02:35:46.309 --> 02:35:46.319 align:start position:0%
on on on both sides
 
02:35:49.429 --> 02:35:49.439 align:start position:0%
senate and house and
 
02:35:53.110 --> 02:35:53.120 align:start position:0%
i don't know why he he
 
02:35:55.590 --> 02:35:55.600 align:start position:0%
really needed someone from finance as
 
02:35:56.230 --> 02:35:56.240 align:start position:0%
well as
 
02:35:59.510 --> 02:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
ways and means but that was that was his
 
02:35:59.520 --> 02:35:59.990 align:start position:0%
ways and means but that was that was his
main

02:35:59.990 --> 02:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
main
 
02:36:03.110 --> 02:36:03.120 align:start position:0%
ask and that's why they tabled it and i
 
02:36:03.120 --> 02:36:03.510 align:start position:0%
ask and that's why they tabled it and i
think

02:36:03.510 --> 02:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
think
 
02:36:07.590 --> 02:36:07.600 align:start position:0%
that if we leave it as a as a house bill
 
02:36:07.600 --> 02:36:08.230 align:start position:0%
that if we leave it as a as a house bill
and

02:36:08.230 --> 02:36:08.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:36:11.750 --> 02:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
and get it out of of the senate bill
 
02:36:13.590 --> 02:36:13.600 align:start position:0%
so that it would they would have to take
 
02:36:15.270 --> 02:36:15.280 align:start position:0%
it off the table which is what they're
 
02:36:16.389 --> 02:36:16.399 align:start position:0%
planning on doing
 
02:36:19.670 --> 02:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
if we do that uh then
 
02:36:22.710 --> 02:36:22.720 align:start position:0%
um i think he'd probably put in an
 
02:36:22.720 --> 02:36:23.349 align:start position:0%
um i think he'd probably put in an
amendment

02:36:23.349 --> 02:36:23.359 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:36:26.389 --> 02:36:26.399 align:start position:0%
to put that into that bill
 
02:36:28.469 --> 02:36:28.479 align:start position:0%
on the floor which i mean that's fine
 
02:36:29.670 --> 02:36:29.680 align:start position:0%
with us right i mean
 
02:36:31.910 --> 02:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
if the senate wants to have one from
 
02:36:33.750 --> 02:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
finance and one from uh
 
02:36:37.670 --> 02:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
from ways and means fine but
 
02:36:39.750 --> 02:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
we have to decide what we want our bill
 
02:36:41.670 --> 02:36:41.680 align:start position:0%
is silent
 
02:36:45.110 --> 02:36:45.120 align:start position:0%
6 565 is silent on what
 
02:36:47.349 --> 02:36:47.359 align:start position:0%
what committees the members come from
 
02:36:49.349 --> 02:36:49.359 align:start position:0%
other than the speaker appoints
 
02:36:51.190 --> 02:36:51.200 align:start position:0%
it's just the speaker of points three
 
02:36:52.870 --> 02:36:52.880 align:start position:0%
members of the house
 
02:36:56.790 --> 02:36:56.800 align:start position:0%
uh uh do we all agree with that
 
02:36:58.309 --> 02:36:58.319 align:start position:0%
that the three members should come from
 
02:37:01.250 --> 02:37:01.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:01.260 --> 02:37:02.870 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:37:02.870 --> 02:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:37:05.670 --> 02:37:05.680 align:start position:0%
what do we want somebody from finance i
 
02:37:07.830 --> 02:37:07.840 align:start position:0%
don't know what
 
02:37:09.910 --> 02:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
uh they don't deal with these things i
 
02:37:11.270 --> 02:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
mean there's a ways of means that deals
 
02:37:12.710 --> 02:37:12.720 align:start position:0%
with this
 
02:37:15.190 --> 02:37:15.200 align:start position:0%
seems to me i think we really need
 
02:37:16.950 --> 02:37:16.960 align:start position:0%
representative ames on this
 
02:37:20.070 --> 02:37:20.080 align:start position:0%
and usually there are two republicans
 
02:37:23.830 --> 02:37:23.840 align:start position:0%
so so we need we
 
02:37:29.670 --> 02:37:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:32.150 --> 02:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
yeah he would chime in just to chime in
 
02:37:33.590 --> 02:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
here you know i think
 
02:37:36.870 --> 02:37:36.880 align:start position:0%
either way it works out um we just want
 
02:37:38.309 --> 02:37:38.319 align:start position:0%
to get the bill passed
 
02:37:42.309 --> 02:37:42.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:45.429 --> 02:37:45.439 align:start position:0%
if the the senate version faces
 
02:37:46.870 --> 02:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
uncertainty because
 
02:37:48.790 --> 02:37:48.800 align:start position:0%
here in the house not just because of
 
02:37:51.990 --> 02:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
any tweaks we would like to make to
 
02:37:54.630 --> 02:37:54.640 align:start position:0%
the part of it that's that's the bill
 
02:37:56.710 --> 02:37:56.720 align:start position:0%
we're talking about but
 
02:37:59.590 --> 02:37:59.600 align:start position:0%
um because it's part of a big omnibus
 
02:37:59.600 --> 02:38:00.070 align:start position:0%
um because it's part of a big omnibus
bill

02:38:00.070 --> 02:38:00.080 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:38:01.990 --> 02:38:02.000 align:start position:0%
and i have no idea i haven't looked
 
02:38:03.510 --> 02:38:03.520 align:start position:0%
closely at that bill but
 
02:38:07.349 --> 02:38:07.359 align:start position:0%
uh but may omnibus bills have not
 
02:38:09.910 --> 02:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
fared that well at least some of them um
 
02:38:09.920 --> 02:38:11.030 align:start position:0%
fared that well at least some of them um
either

02:38:11.030 --> 02:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
either
 
02:38:14.150 --> 02:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
because they ran aground
 
02:38:16.550 --> 02:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
in the house or the senate but also
 
02:38:16.560 --> 02:38:17.349 align:start position:0%
in the house or the senate but also
because

02:38:17.349 --> 02:38:17.359 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:38:20.790 --> 02:38:20.800 align:start position:0%
this the governor has uh has
 
02:38:23.190 --> 02:38:23.200 align:start position:0%
responded negatively to some in the past
 
02:38:23.990 --> 02:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
last year
 
02:38:26.870 --> 02:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
to omnibus bills that had some provision
 
02:38:29.510 --> 02:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
in them that killed the whole thing
 
02:38:32.870 --> 02:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
so there's this risk um associated with
 
02:38:35.190 --> 02:38:35.200 align:start position:0%
being part of an omnibus bill and if
 
02:38:37.270 --> 02:38:37.280 align:start position:0%
we're satisfied there's no risk there
 
02:38:37.280 --> 02:38:38.389 align:start position:0%
we're satisfied there's no risk there
then

02:38:38.389 --> 02:38:38.399 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:38:39.910 --> 02:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
there really is no difference between
 
02:38:41.590 --> 02:38:41.600 align:start position:0%
the two situations
 
02:38:43.590 --> 02:38:43.600 align:start position:0%
we do have a bill that's made it through
 
02:38:45.510 --> 02:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
the house and the senate and has been
 
02:38:47.590 --> 02:38:47.600 align:start position:0%
tabled on the senate side
 
02:38:49.990 --> 02:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
and so it's in a great place to go
 
02:38:51.590 --> 02:38:51.600 align:start position:0%
forward and the other thing i'd say is
 
02:38:51.600 --> 02:38:52.870 align:start position:0%
forward and the other thing i'd say is
that

02:38:52.870 --> 02:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:38:55.510 --> 02:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
i was there at the senate hearing too
 
02:38:57.670 --> 02:38:57.680 align:start position:0%
and i didn't hear such a strong
 
02:39:00.710 --> 02:39:00.720 align:start position:0%
uh point of view from
 
02:39:03.190 --> 02:39:03.200 align:start position:0%
from senator d'alessandro i really don't
 
02:39:05.110 --> 02:39:05.120 align:start position:0%
know whether
 
02:39:09.030 --> 02:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
he if put to the test would
 
02:39:11.510 --> 02:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
care that much about this maybe maybe he
 
02:39:12.630 --> 02:39:12.640 align:start position:0%
does i don't know
 
02:39:14.309 --> 02:39:14.319 align:start position:0%
well i'll take his pulse this afternoon
 
02:39:17.429 --> 02:39:17.439 align:start position:0%
if i get him uh you know yeah
 
02:39:21.510 --> 02:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
all right to be continued then so
 
02:39:25.270 --> 02:39:25.280 align:start position:0%
all right any other business
 
02:39:27.030 --> 02:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
so i think if i'm not mistaken i think
 
02:39:29.830 --> 02:39:29.840 align:start position:0%
we start at 10 o'clock tomorrow
 
02:39:31.750 --> 02:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
uh somebody correct me if i'm wrong okay
 
02:39:33.030 --> 02:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
very good
 
02:39:36.150 --> 02:39:36.160 align:start position:0%
