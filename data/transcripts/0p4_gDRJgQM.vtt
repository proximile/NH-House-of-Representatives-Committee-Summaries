00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:36.840 align:start position:0%
good morning and um thank you members of
 
00:07:39.469 --> 00:07:39.479 align:start position:0%
the committee for allowing me to speak
 
00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:42.520 align:start position:0%
today I'm uh representative Jessica
 
00:07:45.029 --> 00:07:45.039 align:start position:0%
montain representing straford District
 
00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:47.800 align:start position:0%
17 or DOA w
 
00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:50.560 align:start position:0%
5 we have a housing crisis in New
 
00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the median rent for a
 
00:07:54.629 --> 00:07:54.639 align:start position:0%
two-bedroom apartment across the state
 
00:07:58.469 --> 00:07:58.479 align:start position:0%
is almost $1,800 a month and that's not
 
00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
affordable for most most in order to
 
00:08:03.909 --> 00:08:03.919 align:start position:0%
afford that level of rent you would have
 
00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:06.680 align:start position:0%
to have a household income of over
 
00:08:10.469 --> 00:08:10.479 align:start position:0%
$68,000 a year the median household
 
00:08:12.589 --> 00:08:12.599 align:start position:0%
income in New Hampshire is now close to
 
00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:15.240 align:start position:0%
$90,000 so you think well that should be
 
00:08:18.589 --> 00:08:18.599 align:start position:0%
okay right but a quarter of our
 
00:08:21.309 --> 00:08:21.319 align:start position:0%
population has a household income of
 
00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:23.720 align:start position:0%
left less than
 
00:08:26.869 --> 00:08:26.879 align:start position:0%
$50,000 so that makes it very difficult
 
00:08:29.189 --> 00:08:29.199 align:start position:0%
for low-income people to afford a place
 
00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
to rent I believe that both the
 
00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:34.760 align:start position:0%
Democratic and Republican caucuses want
 
00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:35.870 align:start position:0%
Democratic and Republican caucuses want
to

00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:35.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:08:38.269 --> 00:08:38.279 align:start position:0%
prioritize solutions to the housing
 
00:08:41.589 --> 00:08:41.599 align:start position:0%
crisis this year and there are over 60
 
00:08:41.599 --> 00:08:43.149 align:start position:0%
crisis this year and there are over 60
housing

00:08:43.149 --> 00:08:43.159 align:start position:0%
housing
 
00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:47.080 align:start position:0%
bills um that have been filed this year
 
00:08:48.389 --> 00:08:48.399 align:start position:0%
but most of them have to do with
 
00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:50.680 align:start position:0%
changing zoning laws or streamlining the
 
00:08:53.509 --> 00:08:53.519 align:start position:0%
permitting process there are very few
 
00:08:55.829 --> 00:08:55.839 align:start position:0%
that are specific to funding affordable
 
00:08:59.750 --> 00:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
housing projects and this is one of them
 
00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:02.440 align:start position:0%
it's understandable why most homes and
 
00:09:04.949 --> 00:09:04.959 align:start position:0%
apartments are built for the high end of
 
00:09:07.949 --> 00:09:07.959 align:start position:0%
the market that's the only way a private
 
00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:10.480 align:start position:0%
investor can make get a return on their
 
00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:13.480 align:start position:0%
investment and land Building Materials
 
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
and borrowing costs are higher than ever
 
00:09:20.389 --> 00:09:20.399 align:start position:0%
before the only way we can assure that
 
00:09:22.389 --> 00:09:22.399 align:start position:0%
affordable housing units are built is
 
00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:24.640 align:start position:0%
through public and private
 
00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:27.440 align:start position:0%
Partnerships and the affordable housing
 
00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
fund is our best tool to help provide
 
00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:33.240 align:start position:0%
the capital at low interest rates in
 
00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:37.000 align:start position:0%
order to build the mix of units that we
 
00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:38.800 align:start position:0%
most need in the
 
00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
state I know in the city of Dober we
 
00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:45.200 align:start position:0%
have uh it's seemingly endless number of
 
00:09:47.069 --> 00:09:47.079 align:start position:0%
new apartment buildings that are going
 
00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:50.360 align:start position:0%
up it's a very hot area and none of them
 
00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:52.760 align:start position:0%
are affordable they're all built to the
 
00:09:54.269 --> 00:09:54.279 align:start position:0%
high end of the
 
00:09:57.350 --> 00:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
market this past fall I served on a
 
00:09:59.430 --> 00:09:59.440 align:start position:0%
special committee looking at the impact
 
00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:02.240 align:start position:0%
of the housing crisis on people with
 
00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:04.160 align:start position:0%
disabilities having an adult
 
00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
step-daughter with Down
 
00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:08.640 align:start position:0%
syndrome and working in residential home
 
00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:11.320 align:start position:0%
construction myself and being a property
 
00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:14.200 align:start position:0%
uh rental provider I thought I knew a
 
00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:16.360 align:start position:0%
little bit about the situation but it
 
00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:19.160 align:start position:0%
was really eye openening for me to be on
 
00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
that special committee the
 
00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:26.120 align:start position:0%
situation uh and housing for people with
 
00:10:29.829 --> 00:10:29.839 align:start position:0%
disabilities is really dire
 
00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:32.200 align:start position:0%
um you know for many people with
 
00:10:34.949 --> 00:10:34.959 align:start position:0%
disabilities they just they don't just
 
00:10:36.949 --> 00:10:36.959 align:start position:0%
need to find something affordable they
 
00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
need to find something that's accessible
 
00:10:42.069 --> 00:10:42.079 align:start position:0%
as well um most new apartments have
 
00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
elevators but the apartments don't
 
00:10:46.829 --> 00:10:46.839 align:start position:0%
necessarily have Ada bathrooms or
 
00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:49.160 align:start position:0%
hallways and the reality is that most
 
00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
people with disabilities also have low
 
00:10:55.389 --> 00:10:55.399 align:start position:0%
incomes if a person is lucky enough to
 
00:10:57.990 --> 00:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
get federal disability
 
00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:00.360 align:start position:0%
compensation and the average wait time
 
00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:04.040 align:start position:0%
for that is 78 years the amount one
 
00:11:06.829 --> 00:11:06.839 align:start position:0%
receives is basically poverty
 
00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:11.000 align:start position:0%
level so hb30 is a simple bill it
 
00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
doubles the amount of money from the
 
00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:14.560 align:start position:0%
real estate transfer tax that goes into
 
00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
the affordable housing fund increasing
 
00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:20.680 align:start position:0%
it from 5 million to $10 million it's
 
00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
not a tax increase it's just requiring
 
00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
that more of the state budget needs to
 
00:11:28.389 --> 00:11:28.399 align:start position:0%
be put into this fund to address the
 
00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:31.120 align:start position:0%
housing crisis
 
00:11:33.069 --> 00:11:33.079 align:start position:0%
and public and private Partnerships
 
00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:35.000 align:start position:0%
using the affordable housing
 
00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.550 align:start position:0%
using the affordable housing
fund

00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:11:39.069 --> 00:11:39.079 align:start position:0%
are the way we can help
 
00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:41.240 align:start position:0%
nonprofits that manage and build
 
00:11:44.069 --> 00:11:44.079 align:start position:0%
affordable housing properties for
 
00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:47.720 align:start position:0%
example um an apartment complex that 25%
 
00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
of the units are fully accessible and
 
00:11:53.269 --> 00:11:53.279 align:start position:0%
available to people with
 
00:11:55.629 --> 00:11:55.639 align:start position:0%
disabilities or to build Supportive
 
00:11:57.990 --> 00:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
Housing communities for people with
 
00:11:59.829 --> 00:11:59.839 align:start position:0%
intellectual disabilities ities who are
 
00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:03.240 align:start position:0%
not able to live completely
 
00:12:05.389 --> 00:12:05.399 align:start position:0%
independently more and more we are going
 
00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:08.240 align:start position:0%
to need Supportive Housing for people
 
00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:11.720 align:start position:0%
who are aging and cannot afford to live
 
00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
in corporate America's version of
 
00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:17.000 align:start position:0%
Assisted Living I would say half the
 
00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:19.800 align:start position:0%
seniors in our state are not going to be
 
00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:22.360 align:start position:0%
able to afford an assisted living
 
00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:26.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
nonprofit but if we do that if we can
 
00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:31.880 align:start position:0%
build facilities like this this will
 
00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
help all of us in the housing market
 
00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:36.040 align:start position:0%
because then you have people in their
 
00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:39.320 align:start position:0%
empty nest homes that have a place to go
 
00:12:41.509 --> 00:12:41.519 align:start position:0%
and then free up that house for a new
 
00:12:44.949 --> 00:12:44.959 align:start position:0%
family looking for a property to
 
00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
buy the New Hampshire's New Hampshire's
 
00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:50.120 align:start position:0%
affordable housing fund is long overdue
 
00:12:53.389 --> 00:12:53.399 align:start position:0%
for an increase my co-sponsors and I are
 
00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
not the only legislators who think so I
 
00:12:58.670 --> 00:12:58.680 align:start position:0%
just learned last week that a bipartisan
 
00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:01.480 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill s
 
00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:04.880 align:start position:0%
sp81 um virtually was doing the same
 
00:13:07.269 --> 00:13:07.279 align:start position:0%
thing but their bill is a little more
 
00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:09.720 align:start position:0%
aggressive than mine it actually calls
 
00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:13.560 align:start position:0%
for in addition to doubling the amount
 
00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:16.720 align:start position:0%
um in the annual budget it calls for an
 
00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:18.760 align:start position:0%
additional one-time appropriation from
 
00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:22.160 align:start position:0%
the general fund for another $25
 
00:13:24.829 --> 00:13:24.839 align:start position:0%
million it is my hope that both of these
 
00:13:27.509 --> 00:13:27.519 align:start position:0%
bills pass and in the budget process we
 
00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:30.160 align:start position:0%
can come up with a reasonable
 
00:13:32.509 --> 00:13:32.519 align:start position:0%
appropriation enough to jump start the
 
00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
projects that we
 
00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
need so since filing the bill I have
 
00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:41.000 align:start position:0%
drafted an amendment which I would like
 
00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:43.120 align:start position:0%
to pass around to
 
00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:45.320 align:start position:0%
you I probably should have done this
 
00:13:45.320 --> 00:14:09.550 align:start position:0%
you I probably should have done this
before

00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:09.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:13.629 --> 00:14:13.639 align:start position:0%
so this amendment is partly inspired by
 
00:14:16.949 --> 00:14:16.959 align:start position:0%
the boldness of the Senate bill to not I
 
00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
think we took a very cautious approach
 
00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:21.240 align:start position:0%
like let's just double the the amount
 
00:14:23.509 --> 00:14:23.519 align:start position:0%
going to the Affordable Care I mean
 
00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:28.240 align:start position:0%
affordable housing fund um but there
 
00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
were two things one issue is that after
 
00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:33.680 align:start position:0%
seeing the fiscal note um seeing that
 
00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:35.240 align:start position:0%
the increase to the affordable housing
 
00:14:37.269 --> 00:14:37.279 align:start position:0%
fund would come at the expense not just
 
00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
of the general fund but of the education
 
00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:40.269 align:start position:0%
of the general fund but of the education
trust

00:14:40.269 --> 00:14:40.279 align:start position:0%
trust
 
00:14:43.189 --> 00:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
fund so the the wording of the bill was
 
00:14:47.389 --> 00:14:47.399 align:start position:0%
redrafted so that the increase um it
 
00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:49.160 align:start position:0%
changes the language so that the funds
 
00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
going into the affordable housing fund
 
00:14:52.949 --> 00:14:52.959 align:start position:0%
shall be from revenue remaining after
 
00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:55.320 align:start position:0%
the deposit of funds to the education
 
00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:57.389 align:start position:0%
the deposit of funds to the education
trust

00:14:57.389 --> 00:14:57.399 align:start position:0%
trust
 
00:15:00.269 --> 00:15:00.279 align:start position:0%
fund the other section of the amendment
 
00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
makes a prospective appropriation to the
 
00:15:05.189 --> 00:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
affordable housing fund and that's from
 
00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:07.800 align:start position:0%
the I kind of got this idea from a
 
00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
conversation with executive counselor
 
00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:12.680 align:start position:0%
Joe Kenny about the future sale of the
 
00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:15.480 align:start position:0%
Laconia State
 
00:15:17.749 --> 00:15:17.759 align:start position:0%
School um which is going to go for a
 
00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:20.440 align:start position:0%
little over $10
 
00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:22.720 align:start position:0%
million and I don't for those you who
 
00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:25.720 align:start position:0%
don't know that L lonia state school was
 
00:15:28.509 --> 00:15:28.519 align:start position:0%
for most of the 20th century where
 
00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:30.880 align:start position:0%
people with intellectual disabilities
 
00:15:34.069 --> 00:15:34.079 align:start position:0%
were kept isolated from their families
 
00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:36.240 align:start position:0%
given very little opportunities for
 
00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:38.120 align:start position:0%
education or
 
00:15:41.949 --> 00:15:41.959 align:start position:0%
vocation and often kept in deplorable
 
00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:45.720 align:start position:0%
conditions the school was closed in 1991
 
00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:49.000 align:start position:0%
as part of a broader movement of
 
00:15:50.629 --> 00:15:50.639 align:start position:0%
deinstitutionalization and residents
 
00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
were sent back to their
 
00:15:55.749 --> 00:15:55.759 align:start position:0%
communities it's generally felt that
 
00:15:58.470 --> 00:15:58.480 align:start position:0%
there was really not enough planning or
 
00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:00.629 align:start position:0%
there was really not enough planning or
funding

00:16:00.629 --> 00:16:00.639 align:start position:0%
funding
 
00:16:03.949 --> 00:16:03.959 align:start position:0%
to house this popul population of people
 
00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
in their
 
00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
communities and recent well and also
 
00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
many group homes that were set up at the
 
00:16:12.309 --> 00:16:12.319 align:start position:0%
time have
 
00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
failed um that's another whole
 
00:16:21.189 --> 00:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
problem but the the main problem we see
 
00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:25.240 align:start position:0%
that we we really don't have housing um
 
00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
a sustainable housing plan for housing
 
00:16:29.269 --> 00:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
people with intellectual disab abilities
 
00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:33.160 align:start position:0%
in their communities in recent decades
 
00:16:35.389 --> 00:16:35.399 align:start position:0%
children who were born with disabilities
 
00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:37.160 align:start position:0%
now stay at home with their families and
 
00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
they go to public school and all that's
 
00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:42.920 align:start position:0%
great but we're what we're seeing now is
 
00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:44.680 align:start position:0%
this whole population many of them are
 
00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
still living with their families and
 
00:16:48.509 --> 00:16:48.519 align:start position:0%
their parents are
 
00:16:51.069 --> 00:16:51.079 align:start position:0%
aging and these families are really
 
00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:55.000 align:start position:0%
starting to panic about what what future
 
00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
housing Arrangements their children are
 
00:17:01.949 --> 00:17:01.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:04.510 --> 00:17:04.520 align:start position:0%
and and res there are a lot of
 
00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:07.240 align:start position:0%
residential programs out there but they
 
00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:09.640 align:start position:0%
all have long waiting
 
00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:11.150 align:start position:0%
all have long waiting
lists

00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:11.160 align:start position:0%
lists
 
00:17:14.549 --> 00:17:14.559 align:start position:0%
um so we have across the state a number
 
00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:18.160 align:start position:0%
of parent-led groups that want to build
 
00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:19.829 align:start position:0%
of parent-led groups that want to build
Supportive

00:17:19.829 --> 00:17:19.839 align:start position:0%
Supportive
 
00:17:22.590 --> 00:17:22.600 align:start position:0%
Housing uh communities for their adult
 
00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:25.839 align:start position:0%
children with disabilities to live in um
 
00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:27.400 align:start position:0%
several have already established
 
00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:30.200 align:start position:0%
nonprofit organizations and are actively
 
00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:33.200 align:start position:0%
fundraising but they need more
 
00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:35.640 align:start position:0%
Capital so the reason I wrote this
 
00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:38.360 align:start position:0%
amendment and thinking about the sale of
 
00:17:42.549 --> 00:17:42.559 align:start position:0%
this school that did so much harm to the
 
00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
population of people with intellectual
 
00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:48.520 align:start position:0%
disabilities is that I see that if we
 
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:50.320 align:start position:0%
could take that money which we don't
 
00:17:51.909 --> 00:17:51.919 align:start position:0%
know when it's going to come in there's
 
00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
an offer again on the table um but it's
 
00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
for about $10
 
00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
million if we could earmark that $10
 
00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:04.600 align:start position:0%
million perhaps $1 million for each
 
00:18:07.549 --> 00:18:07.559 align:start position:0%
county in the state that could help
 
00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:10.120 align:start position:0%
support housing for people with
 
00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
intellectual disabilities in their
 
00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
community and that was my inspiration
 
00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:16.200 align:start position:0%
for the
 
00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
amendment and it's a way of redressing
 
00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:21.640 align:start position:0%
some of the harm that was done and also
 
00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:24.520 align:start position:0%
helping to fix a
 
00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
problem so that's it okay uh would you
 
00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:31.000 align:start position:0%
like to take questions yes okay
 
00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.390 align:start position:0%
like to take questions yes okay
representative

00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:39.080 align:start position:0%
elme thank you uh do you understand that
 
00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:41.360 align:start position:0%
taking money
 
00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:43.110 align:start position:0%
taking money
from

00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:46.400 align:start position:0%
the uh real estate transfer tax is
 
00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:50.280 align:start position:0%
taking money from the general fund and
 
00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:54.200 align:start position:0%
that taking the money from
 
00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
the this
 
00:18:59.470 --> 00:18:59.480 align:start position:0%
appropriation uh from the
 
00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:02.720 align:start position:0%
the money if that if the lonia school
 
00:19:03.789 --> 00:19:03.799 align:start position:0%
ever gets
 
00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:08.840 align:start position:0%
sold um is also taking money in the end
 
00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
from the general fund and that the
 
00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:13.190 align:start position:0%
from the general fund and that the
general

00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
general
 
00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:15.230 align:start position:0%
general
fund

00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:15.240 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:19:18.909 --> 00:19:18.919 align:start position:0%
uh pays for quite a few of these
 
00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
services and that the finance committee
 
00:19:24.190 --> 00:19:24.200 align:start position:0%
should have the final say on
 
00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:29.200 align:start position:0%
this I do understand that um
 
00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
I think it's a matter of of making
 
00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:34.400 align:start position:0%
priorities and I think we have a crisis
 
00:19:37.669 --> 00:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
in housing and we need to make that a
 
00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:40.400 align:start position:0%
higher priority I do realize the money
 
00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
has to come from
 
00:19:44.909 --> 00:19:44.919 align:start position:0%
somewhere but I think this is the time
 
00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
that we
 
00:19:52.149 --> 00:19:52.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:55.000 align:start position:0%
housing representative ORS thank you Mr
 
00:19:57.070 --> 00:19:57.080 align:start position:0%
chairman thanks for taking my question
 
00:20:00.149 --> 00:20:00.159 align:start position:0%
so you said you own rental properties
 
00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
have you equipped these for handicapped
 
00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:05.080 align:start position:0%
individuals all your properties and have
 
00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:07.120 align:start position:0%
you lowered the rents to help get these
 
00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
people into your
 
00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
properties um yes and no um my husband
 
00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:17.640 align:start position:0%
and I have owned several rental
 
00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:22.440 align:start position:0%
properties um we sold um the last one we
 
00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:26.520 align:start position:0%
owed owned in order to buy a house to
 
00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:29.640 align:start position:0%
house um my stepdaughter
 
00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
um in
 
00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
it um and and it's what in a
 
00:20:37.789 --> 00:20:37.799 align:start position:0%
um it's called a home care providership
 
00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:41.640 align:start position:0%
in which it's um the money for that and
 
00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:43.600 align:start position:0%
the oversight of that is run by one of
 
00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
the community agencies Community
 
00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:49.400 align:start position:0%
Partners in Dober and Eliza and another
 
00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:52.880 align:start position:0%
um person with Down syndrome live in the
 
00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
house with two home care providers and
 
00:20:58.149 --> 00:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
we do rent that at less than market
 
00:20:58.159 --> 00:20:59.750 align:start position:0%
we do rent that at less than market
value

00:20:59.750 --> 00:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
value
 
00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
um we were able to build a duplex behind
 
00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:06.520 align:start position:0%
that property on the same piece of land
 
00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:09.000 align:start position:0%
um but that we ended up building in
 
00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:10.880 align:start position:0%
townhouse style because that's the way
 
00:21:12.669 --> 00:21:12.679 align:start position:0%
it could fit on the lot and that's sort
 
00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:14.840 align:start position:0%
of what we have to do so the new the two
 
00:21:17.909 --> 00:21:17.919 align:start position:0%
new units are not accessible and their
 
00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:20.760 align:start position:0%
market rate but that's the way we can
 
00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:23.320 align:start position:0%
afford to rent the main house below
 
00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:26.360 align:start position:0%
market rate follow up follow up thank
 
00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:29.200 align:start position:0%
you so uh my brother-in-law who turned
 
00:21:31.909 --> 00:21:31.919 align:start position:0%
81 today it's his birthday his wife

00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:56.320 align:start position:0%
but I mean the families I mean you
 
00:21:58.789 --> 00:21:58.799 align:start position:0%
yourself yeah if you're not taking care
 
00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
of your child somebody else is
 
00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
so yeah represent what question oh yes
 
00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
just about to ask you so so what do you
 
00:22:09.789 --> 00:22:09.799 align:start position:0%
think the answer is like if they can do
 
00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
it in their 80s what's the answer for
 
00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:13.720 align:start position:0%
you or people your
 
00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:16.430 align:start position:0%
you or people your
age

00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:16.440 align:start position:0%
age
 
00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
um well let me put it this way I think
 
00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:23.720 align:start position:0%
uh my husband Eliza's father um also
 
00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:26.720 align:start position:0%
coached spe Special Olympics for many
 
00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
years and when he saw
 
00:22:31.549 --> 00:22:31.559 align:start position:0%
these older
 
00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:34.200 align:start position:0%
parents trying to take care of their
 
00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:36.520 align:start position:0%
adult child with a disability he found
 
00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:38.600 align:start position:0%
it really heartbreaking and it didn't
 
00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
look like a good experience for either
 
00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:43.880 align:start position:0%
the child or the parent at this point
 
00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
and he thought I I do not want this to
 
00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:50.720 align:start position:0%
be the future for Eliza nor for me so
 
00:22:53.269 --> 00:22:53.279 align:start position:0%
when Eliza went was in her late 20s is
 
00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:55.320 align:start position:0%
when she first went into a residential
 
00:22:58.669 --> 00:22:58.679 align:start position:0%
home care providership she's still very
 
00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
much a part of our Lives we see her and
 
00:23:04.430 --> 00:23:04.440 align:start position:0%
talk to her all the time but she has
 
00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
learned to have trusting relationships
 
00:23:11.029 --> 00:23:11.039 align:start position:0%
with another person taking care of her
 
00:23:12.269 --> 00:23:12.279 align:start position:0%
and that's really going to help her in
 
00:23:12.279 --> 00:23:13.110 align:start position:0%
and that's really going to help her in
the

00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:16.440 align:start position:0%
future but it's exactly that situation
 
00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:18.360 align:start position:0%
what if your brother-in-law were to die
 
00:23:22.269 --> 00:23:22.279 align:start position:0%
tomorrow what would happen to his child
 
00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:26.320 align:start position:0%
that's why we need um places that are
 
00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:28.600 align:start position:0%
safe and appropriate
 
00:23:31.669 --> 00:23:31.679 align:start position:0%
for such a person to go live when their
 
00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:32.840 align:start position:0%
parents are
 
00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:36.120 align:start position:0%
gone and and we don't have enough of
 
00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:38.480 align:start position:0%
these which is why we need to make this
 
00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
investment and we need to do it
 
00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:45.080 align:start position:0%
now thank you um before I call on

education trust fund twoth thirds would
 
00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:11.840 align:start position:0%

00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:39.200 align:start position:0%
example of an organization that has

benefited from these funds and I'll tell
 
00:25:43.269 --> 00:25:43.279 align:start position:0%
you briefly what we do if you're not
 
00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:46.440 align:start position:0%
familiar with visions we have three
 
00:25:50.269 --> 00:25:50.279 align:start position:0%
sites in Enfield hover and Lebanon at
 
00:25:53.710 --> 00:25:53.720 align:start position:0%
which we support in supported housing 35
 
00:25:55.669 --> 00:25:55.679 align:start position:0%
individuals with developmental
 
00:25:57.870 --> 00:25:57.880 align:start position:0%
disabilities many with additional
 
00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:00.360 align:start position:0%
physical disabilities and complex
 
00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:02.549 align:start position:0%
physical disabilities and complex
medical

00:26:02.549 --> 00:26:02.559 align:start position:0%
medical
 
00:26:05.269 --> 00:26:05.279 align:start position:0%
conditions two of our sites were
 
00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
developed with assistance from the
 
00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:08.960 align:start position:0%
affordable housing
 
00:26:11.909 --> 00:26:11.919 align:start position:0%
fund and I'll speak briefly about the
 
00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
importance of support at the capital
 
00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:19.320 align:start position:0%
phase of projects like ours first of all
 
00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:20.190 align:start position:0%
phase of projects like ours first of all
the

00:26:20.190 --> 00:26:20.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:22.029 align:start position:0%
the
operating

00:26:22.029 --> 00:26:22.039 align:start position:0%
operating
 
00:26:25.470 --> 00:26:25.480 align:start position:0%
um income is extremely limited the folks
 
00:26:29.310 --> 00:26:29.320 align:start position:0%
that we serve they are virtually all on
 
00:26:32.029 --> 00:26:32.039 align:start position:0%
supported by SSI and they're on Medicaid
 
00:26:35.389 --> 00:26:35.399 align:start position:0%
so they're not able to pay Market rents
 
00:26:37.269 --> 00:26:37.279 align:start position:0%
and so you know we're not able to go out
 
00:26:39.669 --> 00:26:39.679 align:start position:0%
and get a market mortgage because we're
 
00:26:41.190 --> 00:26:41.200 align:start position:0%
not going to be able to support that
 
00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
during the operational phase so we have
 
00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:46.360 align:start position:0%
to look for funds HUD
 
00:26:49.909 --> 00:26:49.919 align:start position:0%
funds can come encumbered with fair
 
00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:52.720 align:start position:0%
housing rules which may make it very
 
00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:53.960 align:start position:0%
difficult for you to use it for a
 
00:26:57.029 --> 00:26:57.039 align:start position:0%
population where you're limiting who's
 
00:26:59.710 --> 00:26:59.720 align:start position:0%
going to be able to live in the home
 
00:27:02.110 --> 00:27:02.120 align:start position:0%
uh we we're complete our our building in
 
00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:04.960 align:start position:0%
capital phase is complete at this point
 
00:27:06.389 --> 00:27:06.399 align:start position:0%
but we want to support other
 
00:27:08.269 --> 00:27:08.279 align:start position:0%
organizations in New Hampshire who are
 
00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:09.880 align:start position:0%
trying to do this it's very difficult to
 
00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:13.080 align:start position:0%
do and there's an extraordinary need and
 
00:27:14.789 --> 00:27:14.799 align:start position:0%
I can tell you from my personal
 
00:27:16.389 --> 00:27:16.399 align:start position:0%
experience I'm the father of a
 
00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
20-year-old who suffered a prenatal
 
00:27:22.909 --> 00:27:22.919 align:start position:0%
stroke and had bilateral loss of uh
 
00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
lobes of the brain and she is extremely
 
00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:28.360 align:start position:0%
cognitively impaired mobility impaired
 
00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
and death blind and so I need to plan
 
00:27:35.389 --> 00:27:35.399 align:start position:0%
for her future and you know and live
 
00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:38.960 align:start position:0%
safety safely and as their parents age
 
00:27:41.149 --> 00:27:41.159 align:start position:0%
and are no longer able to take care of
 
00:27:44.269 --> 00:27:44.279 align:start position:0%
them I'm glad to take any questions
 
00:27:46.789 --> 00:27:46.799 align:start position:0%

you know we're facing a housing shortage
 
00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:38.480 align:start position:0%
uh it's due to limited Supply right
 
00:28:40.990 --> 00:28:41.000 align:start position:0%
that's led to record high prices and
 
00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:44.240 align:start position:0%
vacancy rates below 1% they're just not
 
00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
enough homes for people to live and work
 
00:28:47.909 --> 00:28:47.919 align:start position:0%
here and that's impacting everybody it's
 
00:28:49.549 --> 00:28:49.559 align:start position:0%
impacting seniors it's impacting our
 
00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
young families and the workforce that we

need to grow our economy uh there was a
 
00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
recent survey done by the uh Bia and the
 
00:29:00.149 --> 00:29:00.159 align:start position:0%
Center for ethics at St anom College
 
00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:03.440 align:start position:0%
which found that over 86% of leaders
 
00:29:05.509 --> 00:29:05.519 align:start position:0%
cited concerns about affordable housing
 
00:29:07.549 --> 00:29:07.559 align:start position:0%
as their top public policy
 
00:29:11.230 --> 00:29:11.240 align:start position:0%
issue so we urge you to support uh HB
 
00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
530 uh the affordable housing fund I
 
00:29:15.870 --> 00:29:15.880 align:start position:0%
think Jack is possibly testifying but he
 
00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:19.320 align:start position:0%
could speak more to um the how it's just
 
00:29:20.389 --> 00:29:20.399 align:start position:0%
it's a great investment we can make
 
00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
right it's a revolving Loan Fund it's
 
00:29:23.789 --> 00:29:23.799 align:start position:0%
leveraged more than $500 million in

increased Reven Vues to replace what has
 
00:30:04.950 --> 00:30:04.960 align:start position:0%
been lost over the years which is
 
00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:08.960 align:start position:0%
extensive uh given that we are facing a
 
00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
major Revenue
 
00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:14.200 align:start position:0%
crisis I mean at this moment I would not

be able to answer that question but I
 
00:30:16.509 --> 00:30:16.519 align:start position:0%
could certainly take it to our governor
 
00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:18.440 align:start position:0%
counsel and see where they fall on that
 
00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:20.669 align:start position:0%

00:30:35.870 --> 00:30:35.880 align:start position:0%

for a minute there's also uh Maddie Mand
 
00:30:56.909 --> 00:30:56.919 align:start position:0%

or oh I'm sorry okay right proceed thank
 
00:31:08.350 --> 00:31:08.360 align:start position:0%
you anyway um so I am uh the chair of an
 
00:31:10.350 --> 00:31:10.360 align:start position:0%
organization called ourplace NH and we
 
00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
are trying to build housing for adults
 
00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
with developmental disabilities because
 
00:31:17.789 --> 00:31:17.799 align:start position:0%
of the appalling lack of such housing um
 
00:31:20.110 --> 00:31:20.120 align:start position:0%
and I'm in favor of this bill for this
 
00:31:22.269 --> 00:31:22.279 align:start position:0%
purpose um just to give you a little
 
00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
more information there are approximately
 
00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:26.480 align:start position:0%
27,000 people in New Hampshire with
 
00:31:28.509 --> 00:31:28.519 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities
 
00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
and um in 2021 73% of those lived with a
 
00:31:37.269 --> 00:31:37.279 align:start position:0%
family caregiver and 27% of those lived
 
00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:40.440 align:start position:0%
with caregivers over 60 so when you do
 
00:31:42.549 --> 00:31:42.559 align:start position:0%
the math that's a lot of people we
 
00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
already have people on our interested
 
00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:48.320 align:start position:0%
list whose parents are having Strokes or
 
00:31:52.110 --> 00:31:52.120 align:start position:0%
dying and the this is your next at risk
 
00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:54.760 align:start position:0%
for homelessness population these people
 
00:31:57.070 --> 00:31:57.080 align:start position:0%
have been sneakily living in the
 
00:31:58.909 --> 00:31:58.919 align:start position:0%
community being taken care of by their
 
00:32:00.509 --> 00:32:00.519 align:start position:0%
parents and you hardly even know that
 
00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
they're there but there are thousands of
 
00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
them and they are going to need housing
 
00:32:07.549 --> 00:32:07.559 align:start position:0%
not only that they want housing they've
 
00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
been educated they're ready to work in
 
00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
the community they need appropriate
 
00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:16.760 align:start position:0%
Services um we have 118 families on our
 
00:32:19.629 --> 00:32:19.639 align:start position:0%
list farmsteads and Visions the other
 
00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:21.440 align:start position:0%
two places in the state that have this
 
00:32:24.190 --> 00:32:24.200 align:start position:0%
kind of housing have lists of over a 100
 
00:32:27.909 --> 00:32:27.919 align:start position:0%
also so it's dire it's taken our place
 
00:32:30.029 --> 00:32:30.039 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire 5 years to raise enough
 
00:32:32.430 --> 00:32:32.440 align:start position:0%
funds to get a loan to buy a former
 
00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:34.240 align:start position:0%
daycare center which we purchased in
 
00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:37.720 align:start position:0%
August of 2024 now we need to raise
 
00:32:40.590 --> 00:32:40.600 align:start position:0%
about $3 million in order to renovate
 
00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
the daycare center and add four
 
00:32:45.549 --> 00:32:45.559 align:start position:0%
apartments in order to make it a viable
 
00:32:48.549 --> 00:32:48.559 align:start position:0%
business so where do we get $3 million
 
00:32:51.430 --> 00:32:51.440 align:start position:0%
so we're trying to do government grants
 
00:32:54.629 --> 00:32:54.639 align:start position:0%
that's kind of funny these days um we're
 
00:32:56.950 --> 00:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
going to try to Sur uh provide
 
00:32:59.110 --> 00:32:59.120 align:start position:0%
Supportive Housing for 11 individuals
 
00:33:02.029 --> 00:33:02.039 align:start position:0%
with ID which is a small fraction of the
 
00:33:03.509 --> 00:33:03.519 align:start position:0%
housing that we need but we're hoping to
 
00:33:05.430 --> 00:33:05.440 align:start position:0%
come up with a sustainable model that
 
00:33:08.669 --> 00:33:08.679 align:start position:0%
can be recreated in other
 
00:33:08.679 --> 00:33:10.509 align:start position:0%
can be recreated in other
communities

00:33:10.509 --> 00:33:10.519 align:start position:0%
communities
 
00:33:13.230 --> 00:33:13.240 align:start position:0%
um so New Hampshire is just waking up to
 
00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
the reality of this housing crisis and
 
00:33:17.710 --> 00:33:17.720 align:start position:0%
we need to be proactive and provide this
 
00:33:20.029 --> 00:33:20.039 align:start position:0%
housing in order to prevent these people
 
00:33:22.549 --> 00:33:22.559 align:start position:0%
from being placed inappropriately in
 
00:33:25.029 --> 00:33:25.039 align:start position:0%
nursing homes and other more expensive
 
00:33:27.389 --> 00:33:27.399 align:start position:0%
options if we are proactive and we
 
00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
provide this housing you're going to
 
00:33:31.629 --> 00:33:31.639 align:start position:0%
save money in the long
 
00:33:34.110 --> 00:33:34.120 align:start position:0%
run you can imagine what it costs when a
 
00:33:35.950 --> 00:33:35.960 align:start position:0%
parent drops their child off at the
 
00:33:37.549 --> 00:33:37.559 align:start position:0%
emergency room and says I can't take
 
00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:38.720 align:start position:0%
care of them
 
00:33:43.070 --> 00:33:43.080 align:start position:0%
anymore um so to save the cost of extra
 
00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:44.960 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars and also the
 
00:33:46.830 --> 00:33:46.840 align:start position:0%
heartache of the people who deserve a
 
00:33:49.269 --> 00:33:49.279 align:start position:0%
better living situation please support
 
00:33:51.549 --> 00:33:51.559 align:start position:0%

uh Matt uh Maddie

00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:44.320 align:start position:0%
sorry my name is Maddie Mandel bound I
 
00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
am a widow and a single parent to my son
 
00:34:49.869 --> 00:34:49.879 align:start position:0%
Jeremy who is 29 years old when my
 
00:34:52.750 --> 00:34:52.760 align:start position:0%
husband died six years ago suddenly and
 
00:34:54.950 --> 00:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
unexpectedly it quickly occurred to me
 
00:34:57.190 --> 00:34:57.200 align:start position:0%
that my life or any life can end this
 
00:34:59.910 --> 00:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
way as well well the question was how do
 
00:35:02.910 --> 00:35:02.920 align:start position:0%
I begin to plan for Jeremy's future now
 
00:35:05.190 --> 00:35:05.200 align:start position:0%
so that someday he can live safely and
 
00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:08.520 align:start position:0%
purposefully outside of my home as these
 
00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
six years have unfolded I have
 
00:35:13.030 --> 00:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
identified another question how can we
 
00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
plan for and make this transition in a
 
00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
step-by-step process rather than in a
 
00:35:21.390 --> 00:35:21.400 align:start position:0%
crisis environment as so often happens
 
00:35:23.470 --> 00:35:23.480 align:start position:0%
in our state due to the deplorable
 
00:35:25.870 --> 00:35:25.880 align:start position:0%
shortage of homes for our intellectually
 
00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:28.680 align:start position:0%
developmentally disabled loved ones
 
00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:31.040 align:start position:0%
Jeremy has a motor neuron condition
 
00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:34.240 align:start position:0%
hereditary paraplegia he uses a
 
00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:36.720 align:start position:0%
wheelchair to navigate his environment
 
00:35:38.790 --> 00:35:38.800 align:start position:0%
and has learning challenges that impact
 
00:35:40.349 --> 00:35:40.359 align:start position:0%
his understanding of how the world
 
00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
really works but you wouldn't
 
00:35:45.190 --> 00:35:45.200 align:start position:0%
necessarily know that upon meeting him
 
00:35:46.910 --> 00:35:46.920 align:start position:0%
he's a handsome young man who is
 
00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
enjoyable to spend time with and uh has
 
00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:52.480 align:start position:0%
a very easygoing temperament and great
 
00:35:53.550 --> 00:35:53.560 align:start position:0%
sense of
 
00:35:57.150 --> 00:35:57.160 align:start position:0%
humor I just turned 70 years old a day
 
00:35:59.069 --> 00:35:59.079 align:start position:0%
doesn't go by that I don't question on
 
00:36:01.349 --> 00:36:01.359 align:start position:0%
some level how much longer I can care
 
00:36:03.790 --> 00:36:03.800 align:start position:0%
for my son safely when there are
 
00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:06.160 align:start position:0%
incontinence issues connected to a body
 
00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:08.240 align:start position:0%
that cannot control itself in a myriad
 
00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:10.880 align:start position:0%
of ways it is challenging to say the
 
00:36:13.390 --> 00:36:13.400 align:start position:0%
least and it only gets more challenging
 
00:36:16.910 --> 00:36:16.920 align:start position:0%
as time goes on shortly after losing my
 
00:36:18.910 --> 00:36:18.920 align:start position:0%
husband I began networking to learn
 
00:36:21.829 --> 00:36:21.839 align:start position:0%
about housing for Jeremy's population I
 
00:36:24.349 --> 00:36:24.359 align:start position:0%
joined the mo centers Family Support
 
00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
Council to learn about how it may
 
00:36:29.790 --> 00:36:29.800 align:start position:0%
support Jeremy and me I began putting
 
00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
feelers out for any other families
 
00:36:34.870 --> 00:36:34.880 align:start position:0%
interested in the issue of housing as
 
00:36:37.230 --> 00:36:37.240 align:start position:0%
networking allows I learned of a family
 
00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
living down the street who was involved
 
00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
with our place a group of parents in the
 
00:36:46.150 --> 00:36:46.160 align:start position:0%
do area creating a home for ID adults
 
00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:49.240 align:start position:0%
the effort was is based on the Visions
 
00:36:51.950 --> 00:36:51.960 align:start position:0%
model in Enfield New Hampshire I have
 
00:36:53.829 --> 00:36:53.839 align:start position:0%
been volunteering with our place on
 
00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
their developmental on their development
 
00:36:58.510 --> 00:36:58.520 align:start position:0%
committee now for the past 4 years
 
00:37:01.309 --> 00:37:01.319 align:start position:0%
helping them to raise funds necessary to
 
00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:04.480 align:start position:0%
move along in this amazing effort
 
00:37:07.069 --> 00:37:07.079 align:start position:0%
presently we have land and a building
 
00:37:09.390 --> 00:37:09.400 align:start position:0%
that with the N necessary funds can be
 
00:37:11.550 --> 00:37:11.560 align:start position:0%
remodeled and turned into a home for 10
 
00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:14.640 align:start position:0%
to 14 residents but it sits there
 
00:37:16.589 --> 00:37:16.599 align:start position:0%
waiting for the funds to be raised
 
00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:18.400 align:start position:0%
before moving ahead into the
 
00:37:22.230 --> 00:37:22.240 align:start position:0%
construction phase it all takes time the
 
00:37:24.910 --> 00:37:24.920 align:start position:0%
effort is coming from families like mine
 
00:37:26.790 --> 00:37:26.800 align:start position:0%
who are caring for the special needs of
 
00:37:28.069 --> 00:37:28.079 align:start position:0%
our adults
 
00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:30.880 align:start position:0%
while also learning how and putting into
 
00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
effect the individual steps of creating
 
00:37:36.990 --> 00:37:37.000 align:start position:0%
a home absolutely from scratch while the
 
00:37:39.069 --> 00:37:39.079 align:start position:0%
time on the clock ticks away we watch
 
00:37:41.349 --> 00:37:41.359 align:start position:0%
our young adults wondering about their
 
00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:43.720 align:start position:0%
Futures they ask whether they will have
 
00:37:46.030 --> 00:37:46.040 align:start position:0%
to live with us forever and what will
 
00:37:48.790 --> 00:37:48.800 align:start position:0%
happen to them when we die Jeremy is
 
00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:51.160 align:start position:0%
treated for depression and a day doesn't
 
00:37:54.550 --> 00:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
go by when I don't think to myself that
 
00:37:56.750 --> 00:37:56.760 align:start position:0%
his depression would improve if he was
 
00:37:59.069 --> 00:37:59.079 align:start position:0%
living with his peer group making
 
00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
meaningful relationships learning and
 
00:38:04.270 --> 00:38:04.280 align:start position:0%
depending upon one another while gaining
 
00:38:06.030 --> 00:38:06.040 align:start position:0%
a sense of
 
00:38:08.349 --> 00:38:08.359 align:start position:0%
belonging I have established a housing
 
00:38:10.069 --> 00:38:10.079 align:start position:0%
committee through the more Center Family
 
00:38:11.950 --> 00:38:11.960 align:start position:0%
Support council with the intention of
 
00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:13.720 align:start position:0%
creating much needed housing in the
 
00:38:16.790 --> 00:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
Manchester area every town needs a home
 
00:38:18.910 --> 00:38:18.920 align:start position:0%
for its special needs residents to move
 
00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
into actually it is becoming imperative
 
00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:24.640 align:start position:0%
that all towns plan to do this soon as
 
00:38:27.230 --> 00:38:27.240 align:start position:0%
criteria to be accepted into housing is
 
00:38:29.790 --> 00:38:29.800 align:start position:0%
to be a resident of the town or
 
00:38:32.589 --> 00:38:32.599 align:start position:0%
surrounding area where the home is being
 
00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
built funding is the big need not
 
00:38:37.589 --> 00:38:37.599 align:start position:0%
finding the parents interested and
 
00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:40.160 align:start position:0%
motivated to get behind such an effort
 
00:38:41.829 --> 00:38:41.839 align:start position:0%
there are groups of families springing
 
00:38:44.630 --> 00:38:44.640 align:start position:0%
up all over our state with a desire to
 
00:38:46.990 --> 00:38:47.000 align:start position:0%
create housing for their loved ones but
 
00:38:49.109 --> 00:38:49.119 align:start position:0%
it is the funding behind the effort that
 
00:38:51.950 --> 00:38:51.960 align:start position:0%
is a huge barrier to this happening in a
 
00:38:54.829 --> 00:38:54.839 align:start position:0%
more timely way funding is needed for
 
00:38:57.030 --> 00:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
the incorporation process and becoming a
 
00:38:59.750 --> 00:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
nonpr profit it costs money to set up a
 
00:39:01.790 --> 00:39:01.800 align:start position:0%
website so that interested people can
 
00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:03.720 align:start position:0%
follow the mission and important
 
00:39:06.349 --> 00:39:06.359 align:start position:0%
information can be shared it costs money
 
00:39:09.470 --> 00:39:09.480 align:start position:0%
to take money to it costs money to make
 
00:39:12.150 --> 00:39:12.160 align:start position:0%
money such as in hiring a development
 
00:39:14.950 --> 00:39:14.960 align:start position:0%
person to run Capital campaign and here
 
00:39:17.670 --> 00:39:17.680 align:start position:0%
I just rais a few of a very few of the
 
00:39:20.109 --> 00:39:20.119 align:start position:0%
expenses if there is a question about
 
00:39:22.109 --> 00:39:22.119 align:start position:0%
how available State funds should be
 
00:39:24.950 --> 00:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
spent just ask the parents who have paid
 
00:39:27.430 --> 00:39:27.440 align:start position:0%
for some of the above expenses out of
 
00:39:28.510 --> 00:39:28.520 align:start position:0%
their own
 
00:39:30.990 --> 00:39:31.000 align:start position:0%
Pockets there are some amazing benefits
 
00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
to being a part of the ID Community one
 
00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
of them is meeting other families living
 
00:39:38.309 --> 00:39:38.319 align:start position:0%
in the same challenge C challenging
 
00:39:40.910 --> 00:39:40.920 align:start position:0%
circumstances we are we learn from one
 
00:39:44.190 --> 00:39:44.200 align:start position:0%
another and gain hope for moving forward
 
00:39:47.030 --> 00:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
in this state of so few resources we
 
00:39:49.829 --> 00:39:49.839 align:start position:0%
parents are a powerful resource wouldn't
 
00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
it be impressive if the state of New
 
00:39:53.990 --> 00:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would join us families in
 
00:39:56.349 --> 00:39:56.359 align:start position:0%
providing funding toward a need that
 
00:39:58.750 --> 00:39:58.760 align:start position:0%
somehow has been ignored since lonia
 
00:40:01.349 --> 00:40:01.359 align:start position:0%
state school was closed it has been
 
00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
established that our ID population of
 
00:40:06.510 --> 00:40:06.520 align:start position:0%
loved ones is the population in most
 
00:40:09.069 --> 00:40:09.079 align:start position:0%
need of housing as they are the most
 
00:40:11.390 --> 00:40:11.400 align:start position:0%
vulnerable to becoming homeless if it is
 
00:40:14.309 --> 00:40:14.319 align:start position:0%
not provided for them if funding is
 
00:40:16.270 --> 00:40:16.280 align:start position:0%
available let us focus on getting it to
 
00:40:21.950 --> 00:40:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:25.200 align:start position:0%

up with policy that we could advance in
 
00:42:03.990 --> 00:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
order to chip away at the crisis and
 
00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:06.240 align:start position:0%

affordable housing fund um one of those
 
00:42:32.829 --> 00:42:32.839 align:start position:0%

levels as this new housing comes online
 
00:47:17.670 --> 00:47:17.680 align:start position:0%
it is decreasing homelessness and
 
00:47:20.710 --> 00:47:20.720 align:start position:0%

00:47:22.750 --> 00:47:22.760 align:start position:0%

growth of New Hampshire's Workforce
 
00:47:31.829 --> 00:47:31.839 align:start position:0%
which we hear from the business
 
00:47:34.790 --> 00:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
Community is a
 
00:47:39.230 --> 00:47:39.240 align:start position:0%
um high priority given that there uh has
 
00:47:41.990 --> 00:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
been now for several years uh a shortage
 
00:47:44.230 --> 00:47:44.240 align:start position:0%
of available workers um and that of
 
00:47:47.270 --> 00:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
course um has broader implications for
 
00:47:51.750 --> 00:47:51.760 align:start position:0%
the state's economy as a whole so uh we
 
00:47:53.309 --> 00:47:53.319 align:start position:0%
are proud of the work we have done so
 
00:47:55.270 --> 00:47:55.280 align:start position:0%
far to create new housing through the
 
00:47:57.510 --> 00:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
affordable housing fund uh we believe
 
00:47:59.430 --> 00:47:59.440 align:start position:0%
that an increase in funding would be an
 
00:48:01.430 --> 00:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
important step toward increasing the
 
00:48:03.710 --> 00:48:03.720 align:start position:0%
supply of housing in New Hampshire
 
00:48:06.390 --> 00:48:06.400 align:start position:0%
affordable housing at a time when more
 
00:48:08.589 --> 00:48:08.599 align:start position:0%
housing is desperately
 
00:48:10.829 --> 00:48:10.839 align:start position:0%
needed uh and for those reasons we
 
00:48:12.870 --> 00:48:12.880 align:start position:0%
support this bill and we respectfully
 
00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
ask this committee to vote the bill
 
00:48:16.790 --> 00:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
ought to
 
00:48:18.990 --> 00:48:19.000 align:start position:0%
pass with that I'm happy to take any
 
00:48:22.589 --> 00:48:22.599 align:start position:0%
questions thank you do we have any
 
00:48:27.510 --> 00:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:29.630 --> 00:48:29.640 align:start position:0%
your last comment is a bit worrisome to
 
00:48:33.910 --> 00:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
me agencies don't Advocate they
 
00:48:36.150 --> 00:48:36.160 align:start position:0%
Implement um what is your question my
 
00:48:37.990 --> 00:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
question is Sir could
 
00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
you yes he
 
00:48:44.349 --> 00:48:44.359 align:start position:0%
is yeah yes they are they're established
 
00:48:47.670 --> 00:48:47.680 align:start position:0%
by state law uh could you uh Define for
 
00:48:49.789 --> 00:48:49.799 align:start position:0%
some of the new people and differentiate
 
00:48:51.990 --> 00:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
between what Workforce housing is and
 
00:48:56.069 --> 00:48:56.079 align:start position:0%
what affordable housing is sure so
 
00:48:59.470 --> 00:48:59.480 align:start position:0%
affordable housing uh in a broad sense
 
00:49:02.589 --> 00:49:02.599 align:start position:0%
uh is housing for which the renters or
 
00:49:05.430 --> 00:49:05.440 align:start position:0%
homeowners are paying no more than 30%
 
00:49:08.870 --> 00:49:08.880 align:start position:0%
of their gross income for rent and
 
00:49:12.910 --> 00:49:12.920 align:start position:0%
utilities or mortgage and and taxes um
 
00:49:16.270 --> 00:49:16.280 align:start position:0%
Workforce housing targets um households
 
00:49:19.950 --> 00:49:19.960 align:start position:0%
where the um the the income is uh
 
00:49:22.510 --> 00:49:22.520 align:start position:0%
roughly 80% of
 
00:49:27.750 --> 00:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
the average the area median income or a
 
00:49:32.549 --> 00:49:32.559 align:start position:0%
Mi so um we have buildings that are
 
00:49:35.990 --> 00:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
geared mainly towards Workforce housing
 
00:49:38.390 --> 00:49:38.400 align:start position:0%

00:49:57.390 --> 00:49:57.400 align:start position:0%
some of those buildings that serve
 
00:50:00.670 --> 00:50:00.680 align:start position:0%
people who are at 50% of Ami or even
 
00:50:02.470 --> 00:50:02.480 align:start position:0%
lower than that so some who are
 
00:50:06.190 --> 00:50:06.200 align:start position:0%

of the possibility of using funds from
 
00:50:57.470 --> 00:50:57.480 align:start position:0%
the sale of the state school
 
00:51:01.950 --> 00:51:01.960 align:start position:0%

fortunately never had to live at the
 
00:51:06.750 --> 00:51:06.760 align:start position:0%
state school but um they could rectify
 
00:51:08.670 --> 00:51:08.680 align:start position:0%
some of the harm done to people who did
 
00:51:11.069 --> 00:51:11.079 align:start position:0%
live there I am the parent of a
 
00:51:13.789 --> 00:51:13.799 align:start position:0%
31-year-old son Micah who has what is
 
00:51:17.030 --> 00:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
now called level three autism or severe
 
00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
autism that falls under the diagnosis of
 
00:51:22.230 --> 00:51:22.240 align:start position:0%
intellectual developmental disability in
 
00:51:24.589 --> 00:51:24.599 align:start position:0%
Micah's case his diagnosis means he is
 
00:51:27.710 --> 00:51:27.720 align:start position:0%
non-verbal and needs one to one and care
 
00:51:30.549 --> 00:51:30.559 align:start position:0%
every waking moment I am blessed that my
 
00:51:34.750 --> 00:51:34.760 align:start position:0%
6'2 240 lb son is a gentle guy but his
 
00:51:36.910 --> 00:51:36.920 align:start position:0%
impulsive actions such as bolting away
 
00:51:39.990 --> 00:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
from his caregivers and Pica which means
 
00:51:43.589 --> 00:51:43.599 align:start position:0%
eating inedible objects often places him
 
00:51:45.950 --> 00:51:45.960 align:start position:0%
and sometimes others at risk Michael
 
00:51:48.109 --> 00:51:48.119 align:start position:0%
lives at home and he has a family
 
00:51:50.789 --> 00:51:50.799 align:start position:0%
directed program via the Moore Center
 
00:51:53.109 --> 00:51:53.119 align:start position:0%
Micah's father died of brain cancer when
 
00:51:57.150 --> 00:51:57.160 align:start position:0%
Micah was aged 14 thus I am his Survivor
 
00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
parent Micah has wonderful siblings who
 
00:52:02.589 --> 00:52:02.599 align:start position:0%
will be for be there for him in the long
 
00:52:05.470 --> 00:52:05.480 align:start position:0%
run but it is my hope that they can fil
 
00:52:07.670 --> 00:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
fulfill the important sibling role with
 
00:52:10.109 --> 00:52:10.119 align:start position:0%
Micah settled into a residence where he
 
00:52:12.870 --> 00:52:12.880 align:start position:0%
can age in place before I am too old to
 
00:52:15.549 --> 00:52:15.559 align:start position:0%
care for him full-time currently New

of a parent group who's connected
 
00:52:33.230 --> 00:52:33.240 align:start position:0%
through the mo Center because of our
 
00:52:35.349 --> 00:52:35.359 align:start position:0%
mutual concern about the lack of housing
 
00:52:38.230 --> 00:52:38.240 align:start position:0%
options for our disabled family members
 
00:52:39.789 --> 00:52:39.799 align:start position:0%
we are currently in the process of
 
00:52:41.589 --> 00:52:41.599 align:start position:0%
becoming a nonprofit so that we can
 
00:52:43.910 --> 00:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
raise funds to create housing for our
 
00:52:48.150 --> 00:52:48.160 align:start position:0%
adult children passage of HB 530 and its
 
00:52:51.030 --> 00:52:51.040 align:start position:0%

00:53:09.710 --> 00:53:09.720 align:start position:0%
way to positively impact the future for

00:59:48.309 --> 00:59:48.319 align:start position:0%
okay I'm going to open the public
 
00:59:50.750 --> 00:59:50.760 align:start position:0%
hearing on HB
 
00:59:53.789 --> 00:59:53.799 align:start position:0%
531 and um before I invite
 
00:59:56.549 --> 00:59:56.559 align:start position:0%
representative Ames up um I think we
 
00:59:59.430 --> 00:59:59.440 align:start position:0%
didn't anticipate the size of this crowd
 
01:00:01.750 --> 01:00:01.760 align:start position:0%
um we've got I've got about 20 roughly
 
01:00:04.150 --> 01:00:04.160 align:start position:0%
20 people who want to speak um I'm sure
 
01:00:05.510 --> 01:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of you are going to say similar
 
01:00:08.470 --> 01:00:08.480 align:start position:0%
things um so what I'm going to do is let
 
01:00:11.190 --> 01:00:11.200 align:start position:0%
representative Ames introduce the bill
 
01:00:13.910 --> 01:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
um and after he's done introducing I'm
 
01:00:15.630 --> 01:00:15.640 align:start position:0%
going to limit every other speaker to
 
01:00:17.630 --> 01:00:17.640 align:start position:0%
two minutes and I'm going to enforce
 
01:00:21.510 --> 01:00:21.520 align:start position:0%
that fairly rigorously um so I would ask
 
01:00:23.470 --> 01:00:23.480 align:start position:0%
you when you you know what's come before
 
01:00:26.589 --> 01:00:26.599 align:start position:0%
you try to think about focus on maybe
 
01:00:28.470 --> 01:00:28.480 align:start position:0%
something a little different you know to
 
01:00:30.190 --> 01:00:30.200 align:start position:0%
make your point but I want to enforce
 
01:00:33.549 --> 01:00:33.559 align:start position:0%
that uh two minutes thank you
 
01:00:33.559 --> 01:00:45.430 align:start position:0%
that uh two minutes thank you
representative

01:00:45.430 --> 01:00:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
vs good
 
01:00:50.309 --> 01:00:50.319 align:start position:0%
morning uh I'm here
 
01:00:55.309 --> 01:00:55.319 align:start position:0%
to introduce and speak to House Bill 531
 
01:00:57.349 --> 01:00:57.359 align:start position:0%
setting annual limits on the amount of
 
01:01:00.109 --> 01:01:00.119 align:start position:0%
charitable Gaming revenue which may be
 
01:01:03.309 --> 01:01:03.319 align:start position:0%
distributed to one charitable
 
01:01:07.029 --> 01:01:07.039 align:start position:0%
organization and what I uh wish to say
 
01:01:13.789 --> 01:01:13.799 align:start position:0%
is that uh this uh Bill originated in uh
 
01:01:16.910 --> 01:01:16.920 align:start position:0%
um out of discussions come comes from
 
01:01:20.150 --> 01:01:20.160 align:start position:0%
discussions in the uh gaming commission
 
01:01:23.190 --> 01:01:23.200 align:start position:0%
charal gaming commission that I was a
 
01:01:26.870 --> 01:01:26.880 align:start position:0%
member of that worked through the summer
 
01:01:30.510 --> 01:01:30.520 align:start position:0%
under the able direction of uh of
 
01:01:34.589 --> 01:01:34.599 align:start position:0%
Patrick abami um and
 
01:01:38.390 --> 01:01:38.400 align:start position:0%
um in the course of those
 
01:01:42.390 --> 01:01:42.400 align:start position:0%
discussions uh we
 
01:01:47.309 --> 01:01:47.319 align:start position:0%
um were presented with information
 
01:01:50.470 --> 01:01:50.480 align:start position:0%
that was of concern I think to most of
 
01:01:58.029 --> 01:01:58.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:02.430 --> 01:02:02.440 align:start position:0%
the pathway that had been uh followed
 
01:02:05.510 --> 01:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
with Char the the selection and funding
 
01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:06.510 align:start position:0%
with Char the the selection and funding
of

01:02:06.510 --> 01:02:06.520 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:02:10.870 --> 01:02:10.880 align:start position:0%
Charities and whether it was a a pathway
 
01:02:14.910 --> 01:02:14.920 align:start position:0%
that could be sustained it seemed to be
 
01:02:19.470 --> 01:02:19.480 align:start position:0%
unsustainable um the problem is this the
 
01:02:21.390 --> 01:02:21.400 align:start position:0%
revenues have
 
01:02:24.230 --> 01:02:24.240 align:start position:0%
increased uh coming out of charal gaming
 
01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:26.560 align:start position:0%
increased uh coming out of charal gaming
significantly

01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:26.570 align:start position:0%
significantly
 
01:02:26.570 --> 01:02:27.990 align:start position:0%
significantly
[Music]

01:02:27.990 --> 01:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:02:32.829 --> 01:02:32.839 align:start position:0%
um and that has played out to benefit
 
01:02:37.710 --> 01:02:37.720 align:start position:0%
those Charities that are in the game so
 
01:02:41.430 --> 01:02:41.440 align:start position:0%
to speak that uh have been able to get
 
01:02:46.470 --> 01:02:46.480 align:start position:0%
on a list at one of the um facilities
 
01:02:48.829 --> 01:02:48.839 align:start position:0%
where the revenues are way up and those
 
01:02:52.230 --> 01:02:52.240 align:start position:0%
are I think exclusively facilities that
 
01:02:54.390 --> 01:02:54.400 align:start position:0%
have historic horse racing there's also
 
01:02:56.549 --> 01:02:56.559 align:start position:0%
been some increase in
 
01:03:00.190 --> 01:03:00.200 align:start position:0%
uh revenues from um uh card playing and
 
01:03:03.589 --> 01:03:03.599 align:start position:0%
other activities that uh are allowed as
 
01:03:05.470 --> 01:03:05.480 align:start position:0%
part of charitable gaming that are not
 
01:03:09.109 --> 01:03:09.119 align:start position:0%
machine gaming and that uh results from
 
01:03:11.630 --> 01:03:11.640 align:start position:0%
higher bet limits that have been also
 
01:03:15.990 --> 01:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
enacted so um so more Revenue coming in
 
01:03:19.069 --> 01:03:19.079 align:start position:0%
for Char gaming that's benefited those
 
01:03:22.829 --> 01:03:22.839 align:start position:0%
who are on the list uh and have been uh
 
01:03:26.789 --> 01:03:26.799 align:start position:0%
given days to uh uh in which the
 
01:03:31.029 --> 01:03:31.039 align:start position:0%
revenues benefit those Charities um and
 
01:03:33.309 --> 01:03:33.319 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
01:03:36.589 --> 01:03:36.599 align:start position:0%
not those not on the list Charities
 
01:03:38.510 --> 01:03:38.520 align:start position:0%
which fire out number of the ones that
 
01:03:41.829 --> 01:03:41.839 align:start position:0%
are on are on the list across the state
 
01:03:45.510 --> 01:03:45.520 align:start position:0%
uh do not benefit from this uh this
 
01:03:48.150 --> 01:03:48.160 align:start position:0%
Revenue stream at all
 
01:03:52.470 --> 01:03:52.480 align:start position:0%
um and uh it seemed to us as we thought
 
01:03:56.630 --> 01:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
about this and I remember I think uh
 
01:03:58.950 --> 01:03:58.960 align:start position:0%
um I don't know whether to call him
 
01:04:02.069 --> 01:04:02.079 align:start position:0%
representative of bramy or The Honorable
 
01:04:04.630 --> 01:04:04.640 align:start position:0%
representative of bramy or The Honorable
 
01:04:09.510 --> 01:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
AB brami but uh he's honorable and um uh
 
01:04:12.789 --> 01:04:12.799 align:start position:0%
he actually uh passed around uh sort of
 
01:04:15.870 --> 01:04:15.880 align:start position:0%
a thought piece about uh about this that
 
01:04:18.910 --> 01:04:18.920 align:start position:0%
had a had a limit in it as does this
 
01:04:23.109 --> 01:04:23.119 align:start position:0%
bill um and part of the reason for
 
01:04:25.950 --> 01:04:25.960 align:start position:0%
putting a limit in uh during that that
 
01:04:30.349 --> 01:04:30.359 align:start position:0%
discussion was uh that it would
 
01:04:33.670 --> 01:04:33.680 align:start position:0%
uh that it would
 
01:04:35.789 --> 01:04:35.799 align:start position:0%
um buy
 
01:04:39.470 --> 01:04:39.480 align:start position:0%
time for figuring out a long-term
 
01:04:41.990 --> 01:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
solution that would work for the
 
01:04:45.710 --> 01:04:45.720 align:start position:0%
allocation for the uh uh choice of
 
01:04:47.670 --> 01:04:47.680 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries and uh for the
 
01:04:51.269 --> 01:04:51.279 align:start position:0%
distribution of this money to Charities
 
01:04:54.349 --> 01:04:54.359 align:start position:0%
um in the end we didn't include that in
 
01:04:56.230 --> 01:04:56.240 align:start position:0%
our report although I really don't
 
01:04:58.390 --> 01:04:58.400 align:start position:0%
remember as I sit here whether there's
 
01:05:01.349 --> 01:05:01.359 align:start position:0%
any wording in the report uh uh that's
 
01:05:06.109 --> 01:05:06.119 align:start position:0%
summarizing the issue um so here we are
 
01:05:10.710 --> 01:05:10.720 align:start position:0%
today I I put this bill in as a followup
 
01:05:14.829 --> 01:05:14.839 align:start position:0%
to that discussion um and uh and with
 
01:05:18.109 --> 01:05:18.119 align:start position:0%
the thought that uh there's a real risk
 
01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:20.760 align:start position:0%
here that Charities who are on the
 
01:05:25.190 --> 01:05:25.200 align:start position:0%
inside in this uh in this uh system in
 
01:05:27.950 --> 01:05:27.960 align:start position:0%
other words who are getting higher
 
01:05:31.309 --> 01:05:31.319 align:start position:0%
revenues um may be
 
01:05:34.230 --> 01:05:34.240 align:start position:0%
headed may become used to a funding
 
01:05:36.230 --> 01:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
level that cannot be
 
01:05:40.950 --> 01:05:40.960 align:start position:0%
sustained once uh once uh in in the
 
01:05:44.829 --> 01:05:44.839 align:start position:0%
event that a system that's more fair and
 
01:05:49.150 --> 01:05:49.160 align:start position:0%
uh distributes revenues uh um further or
 
01:05:52.109 --> 01:05:52.119 align:start position:0%
in a different way uh we'll find it very
 
01:05:56.190 --> 01:05:56.200 align:start position:0%
hard to readjust to a lower level of
 
01:05:59.069 --> 01:05:59.079 align:start position:0%
operation maybe maybe the number I chose
 
01:06:04.589 --> 01:06:04.599 align:start position:0%
was too low uh I leave that here
 
01:06:10.470 --> 01:06:10.480 align:start position:0%
um your your uh work session and uh
 
01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:11.990 align:start position:0%
um your your uh work session and uh
discussions

01:06:11.990 --> 01:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
discussions
 
01:06:15.549 --> 01:06:15.559 align:start position:0%
um and maybe it doesn't is not a good
 
01:06:19.390 --> 01:06:19.400 align:start position:0%
idea but that's that's its purpose and
 
01:06:24.349 --> 01:06:24.359 align:start position:0%
in no way in no way does this proposal
 
01:06:28.029 --> 01:06:28.039 align:start position:0%
suggest that uh any single charity
 
01:06:29.750 --> 01:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
that's on the list that's currently
 
01:06:33.109 --> 01:06:33.119 align:start position:0%
getting $100,000 or
 
01:06:38.230 --> 01:06:38.240 align:start position:0%
$150,000 um should be um uh thought to
 
01:06:41.430 --> 01:06:41.440 align:start position:0%
be undeserving of uh the funding that's
 
01:06:45.069 --> 01:06:45.079 align:start position:0%
been provided or that uh consideration
 
01:06:47.589 --> 01:06:47.599 align:start position:0%
should not be given to the possibility
 
01:06:50.870 --> 01:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
of of of of causing harm that doesn't
 
01:06:52.789 --> 01:06:52.799 align:start position:0%
need to be caused so I hope that you
 
01:06:56.269 --> 01:06:56.279 align:start position:0%
look closely at this bill and uh and
 
01:06:59.630 --> 01:06:59.640 align:start position:0%
develop a uh position on it that uh
 
01:07:01.829 --> 01:07:01.839 align:start position:0%
takes into account all of these
 
01:07:03.390 --> 01:07:03.400 align:start position:0%
realities I think you're going to hear
 
01:07:07.150 --> 01:07:07.160 align:start position:0%
from some of those realities from the uh
 
01:07:11.069 --> 01:07:11.079 align:start position:0%
long list that was mentioned of uh that
 
01:07:13.510 --> 01:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
of people who wish to speak so that's
 
01:07:17.789 --> 01:07:17.799 align:start position:0%
those are my uh my thoughts on this
 
01:07:19.990 --> 01:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you representative Ames and
 
01:07:21.510 --> 01:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
it's good to see you back in ways and
 
01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:22.470 align:start position:0%
it's good to see you back in ways and
means

01:07:22.470 --> 01:07:22.480 align:start position:0%
means
 
01:07:26.630 --> 01:07:26.640 align:start position:0%
of um do we have yes represent
 
01:07:29.349 --> 01:07:29.359 align:start position:0%
op thank you Mr chairman um and thank
 
01:07:31.710 --> 01:07:31.720 align:start position:0%
you representative Ames
 
01:07:33.990 --> 01:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
um as I read this bill I just want to
 
01:07:36.349 --> 01:07:36.359 align:start position:0%
make sure I'm understanding correctly
 
01:07:39.069 --> 01:07:39.079 align:start position:0%
are you proposing or does this bill
 
01:07:42.950 --> 01:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
propose uh essentially a $50,000 cap for
 
01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:44.349 align:start position:0%
propose uh essentially a $50,000 cap for
Charities

01:07:44.349 --> 01:07:44.359 align:start position:0%
Charities
 
01:07:47.230 --> 01:07:47.240 align:start position:0%
receiving um money from historic horse
 
01:07:52.349 --> 01:07:52.359 align:start position:0%
racing and a $50,000 cap for uh
 
01:07:55.589 --> 01:07:55.599 align:start position:0%
Charities receiving money from other
 
01:07:59.269 --> 01:07:59.279 align:start position:0%
gaming sources so potentially a $100,000
 
01:08:02.069 --> 01:08:02.079 align:start position:0%
cap is that am I reading that right I
 
01:08:04.029 --> 01:08:04.039 align:start position:0%
don't think that's the way it reads I
 
01:08:06.109 --> 01:08:06.119 align:start position:0%
think it reads as
 
01:08:11.390 --> 01:08:11.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:15.749 --> 01:08:15.759 align:start position:0%
um the amount collected in any calendar
 
01:08:19.309 --> 01:08:19.319 align:start position:0%
year um and that's the limit I don't
 
01:08:22.669 --> 01:08:22.679 align:start position:0%
think you can double up that's my
 
01:08:25.189 --> 01:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
understanding yeah okay that it it would
 
01:08:27.550 --> 01:08:27.560 align:start position:0%
appear there are two separate paragraphs
 
01:08:29.430 --> 01:08:29.440 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry yes follow up it would appear
 
01:08:31.390 --> 01:08:31.400 align:start position:0%
there are two separate paragraphs oh I
 
01:08:34.430 --> 01:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
see I see what you're saying well look
 
01:08:38.390 --> 01:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
at it and uh figure that out we will we
 
01:08:40.070 --> 01:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
will have a work session on this bill if
 
01:08:41.910 --> 01:08:41.920 align:start position:0%
I hadn't mentioned it yet representative
 
01:08:43.789 --> 01:08:43.799 align:start position:0%
you said Thank you Mr chairman and I
 
01:08:45.390 --> 01:08:45.400 align:start position:0%
thank my
 
01:08:47.870 --> 01:08:47.880 align:start position:0%
friend would
 
01:08:50.669 --> 01:08:50.679 align:start position:0%
you would you have reservation with this
 
01:08:55.470 --> 01:08:55.480 align:start position:0%
bill knowing that 538 the the next
 
01:08:56.950 --> 01:08:56.960 align:start position:0%
commission gaming commission going
 
01:08:59.110 --> 01:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
forward this would be something in their
 
01:09:03.070 --> 01:09:03.080 align:start position:0%
purview to to address because and I want
 
01:09:05.749 --> 01:09:05.759 align:start position:0%
to add to this the the way this reads to
 
01:09:09.110 --> 01:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
me is and it's May maybe it's something
 
01:09:11.669 --> 01:09:11.679 align:start position:0%
for that commission to address but this
 
01:09:13.030 --> 01:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
kind of looks like we're changing the
 
01:09:15.630 --> 01:09:15.640 align:start position:0%
whole platform to a grant to these
 
01:09:17.110 --> 01:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
Charities at
 
01:09:19.749 --> 01:09:19.759 align:start position:0%
$50,000 that may be the solution to this
 
01:09:23.189 --> 01:09:23.199 align:start position:0%
at the end but would you would you think
 
01:09:24.910 --> 01:09:24.920 align:start position:0%
it's a little premature with that
 
01:09:27.470 --> 01:09:27.480 align:start position:0%
upcoming commission coming with with the
 
01:09:29.550 --> 01:09:29.560 align:start position:0%
changes in gaming with all the issues
 
01:09:33.390 --> 01:09:33.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:35.789 --> 01:09:35.799 align:start position:0%
commission I actually I actually don't
 
01:09:40.110 --> 01:09:40.120 align:start position:0%
think it's premature maybe uh not right
 
01:09:43.789 --> 01:09:43.799 align:start position:0%
the way it's set out but um the con the
 
01:09:48.309 --> 01:09:48.319 align:start position:0%
concern is uh I think I remember when we
 
01:09:50.070 --> 01:09:50.080 align:start position:0%
talked about the charal gaming
 
01:09:54.350 --> 01:09:54.360 align:start position:0%
commission Bill your use of the word uh
 
01:10:00.470 --> 01:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
Legacy Charities um and it becomes
 
01:10:04.830 --> 01:10:04.840 align:start position:0%
uh embedded in the system uh the higher
 
01:10:07.350 --> 01:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
level and so the thought here was let's
 
01:10:10.070 --> 01:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
put a pause on it as I said maybe this
 
01:10:12.870 --> 01:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
number is not right and maybe uh maybe
 
01:10:17.310 --> 01:10:17.320 align:start position:0%
it's not uh it needs to be uh clarified
 
01:10:22.350 --> 01:10:22.360 align:start position:0%
as to what it applies to um but
 
01:10:26.350 --> 01:10:26.360 align:start position:0%
um it does seem to be Merit in in uh in
 
01:10:30.910 --> 01:10:30.920 align:start position:0%
setting a limit that
 
01:10:34.830 --> 01:10:34.840 align:start position:0%
uh that will be in play while either the
 
01:10:36.870 --> 01:10:36.880 align:start position:0%
gaming commission or this Committee in
 
01:10:39.350 --> 01:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
response to another bill uh works out a
 
01:10:41.990 --> 01:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
better system followup just quick
 
01:10:43.950 --> 01:10:43.960 align:start position:0%
followup and and if I'm reading this
 
01:10:46.189 --> 01:10:46.199 align:start position:0%
correct uh correctly and correct me if
 
01:10:49.149 --> 01:10:49.159 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong it it seems to me that when
 
01:10:51.950 --> 01:10:51.960 align:start position:0%
they hit that $50,000 Cap all the other
 
01:10:53.229 --> 01:10:53.239 align:start position:0%
Revenue goes
 
01:10:55.830 --> 01:10:55.840 align:start position:0%
to lottery so which changing the
 
01:10:59.310 --> 01:10:59.320 align:start position:0%
platform we have in totality in Char
 
01:11:01.550 --> 01:11:01.560 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming which is something we
 
01:11:04.030 --> 01:11:04.040 align:start position:0%
explored for years and years we have a
 
01:11:06.910 --> 01:11:06.920 align:start position:0%
platform right now a model that's been
 
01:11:10.470 --> 01:11:10.480 align:start position:0%
operating this in totality changes that
 
01:11:13.189 --> 01:11:13.199 align:start position:0%
model and in my
 
01:11:16.830 --> 01:11:16.840 align:start position:0%
estimation um in the uh immediate uh
 
01:11:20.510 --> 01:11:20.520 align:start position:0%
aftermath of the imposition of this uh I
 
01:11:23.149 --> 01:11:23.159 align:start position:0%
I suppose that would be right um that's
 
01:11:25.870 --> 01:11:25.880 align:start position:0%
true um the
 
01:11:28.430 --> 01:11:28.440 align:start position:0%
um money something has to be done with
 
01:11:29.990 --> 01:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
the money it seems a reasonable thing
 
01:11:32.630 --> 01:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
that go into the education trust fund
 
01:11:35.950 --> 01:11:35.960 align:start position:0%
which is where it would go and that's uh
 
01:11:41.669 --> 01:11:41.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:44.149 --> 01:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
Schools okay seeing no more questions
 
01:11:45.669 --> 01:11:45.679 align:start position:0%
thank you representative am and if you
 
01:11:47.870 --> 01:11:47.880 align:start position:0%
could fill out a pink card that'd be
 
01:11:53.270 --> 01:11:53.280 align:start position:0%

01:11:56.590 --> 01:11:56.600 align:start position:0%
I said you know I'm going to limit
 
01:11:58.950 --> 01:11:58.960 align:start position:0%
people to two minutes uh try not to
 
01:12:00.910 --> 01:12:00.920 align:start position:0%
repeat because I'll tell you that all 20
 
01:12:03.070 --> 01:12:03.080 align:start position:0%
pin cards I have at the moment they all
 
01:12:06.470 --> 01:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
oppose the bill so it's not like uh we
 
01:12:08.229 --> 01:12:08.239 align:start position:0%
need to hear the same thing 20 times but
 
01:12:09.709 --> 01:12:09.719 align:start position:0%

01:12:12.189 --> 01:12:12.199 align:start position:0%

the chable gaming commission which met
 
01:13:14.990 --> 01:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
for I would say a year and a half and we
 
01:13:17.590 --> 01:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
came up with a report uh that had 25
 
01:13:20.030 --> 01:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
recommendations in it and one does touch
 
01:13:21.470 --> 01:13:21.480 align:start position:0%
on this
 
01:13:24.590 --> 01:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
topic uh I'm here to oppose the bill
 
01:13:26.830 --> 01:13:26.840 align:start position:0%
respectfully opposed the bill I have the
 
01:13:29.270 --> 01:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
highest regard for representative Ames
 
01:13:30.350 --> 01:13:30.360 align:start position:0%
he was on the
 
01:13:32.430 --> 01:13:32.440 align:start position:0%
commission representative Janan was on
 
01:13:34.350 --> 01:13:34.360 align:start position:0%
the commission represent duet was on the
 
01:13:35.629 --> 01:13:35.639 align:start position:0%
commission as
 
01:13:38.030 --> 01:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
well um by the way I was the
 
01:13:39.510 --> 01:13:39.520 align:start position:0%
representative along with representative
 
01:13:42.629 --> 01:13:42.639 align:start position:0%
duet who brought us uh uh historic
 
01:13:44.669 --> 01:13:44.679 align:start position:0%
racing machines in this in the
 
01:13:47.750 --> 01:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
state so I'm going to have to trim it
 
01:13:50.910 --> 01:13:50.920 align:start position:0%
down to because of the limitation on the
 
01:13:58.270 --> 01:13:58.280 align:start position:0%
time uh but I I I uh provided you with
 
01:14:02.229 --> 01:14:02.239 align:start position:0%
two two a a handout I put on the
 
01:14:06.870 --> 01:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:09.350 --> 01:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
this during the course of the commission
 
01:14:11.709 --> 01:14:11.719 align:start position:0%
one Sunday I decided to go through all
 
01:14:14.950 --> 01:14:14.960 align:start position:0%
800 Charities and try to group them into
 
01:14:16.790 --> 01:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
what we're talking
 
01:14:19.550 --> 01:14:19.560 align:start position:0%
about and you could see I think it's
 
01:14:21.750 --> 01:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
very informational for everybody to
 
01:14:23.390 --> 01:14:23.400 align:start position:0%
understand that it's a wide breath of
 
01:14:26.229 --> 01:14:26.239 align:start position:0%
things that these terrible funds go to
 
01:14:29.270 --> 01:14:29.280 align:start position:0%
all the way from Youth Sports to Easter
 
01:14:31.669 --> 01:14:31.679 align:start position:0%
Seals to you name
 
01:14:35.229 --> 01:14:35.239 align:start position:0%
it but I agree that this when I looked
 
01:14:37.510 --> 01:14:37.520 align:start position:0%
at this I said to myself because we had
 
01:14:39.790 --> 01:14:39.800 align:start position:0%
five charges in this commission but I
 
01:14:42.590 --> 01:14:42.600 align:start position:0%
broughten it out to 25 we had 25
 
01:14:44.830 --> 01:14:44.840 align:start position:0%
questions and one was do we need to
 
01:14:47.470 --> 01:14:47.480 align:start position:0%
address especially as these casinos grow
 
01:14:49.629 --> 01:14:49.639 align:start position:0%
charal gaming locations
 
01:14:52.189 --> 01:14:52.199 align:start position:0%
grow we can have to start addressing how
 
01:14:54.350 --> 01:14:54.360 align:start position:0%
much what the ceiling should be and how
 
01:14:57.790 --> 01:14:57.800 align:start position:0%
much any individual charity can make
 
01:15:00.110 --> 01:15:00.120 align:start position:0%
right now if you go to the second page I
 
01:15:03.910 --> 01:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
have a slight distribution of of of
 
01:15:06.830 --> 01:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
that where
 
01:15:10.110 --> 01:15:10.120 align:start position:0%
34.7% make between 0 and
 
01:15:13.430 --> 01:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
25,000 uh all the way up to 1.3% make
 
01:15:17.070 --> 01:15:17.080 align:start position:0%
between 125 to 150,000 for their 10 days
 
01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:18.790 align:start position:0%
between 125 to 150,000 for their 10 days
of

01:15:18.790 --> 01:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:20.830 align:start position:0%
of
sponsorship

01:15:20.830 --> 01:15:20.840 align:start position:0%
sponsorship
 
01:15:25.510 --> 01:15:25.520 align:start position:0%
so now does a sports team need1 15 ,000
 
01:15:28.629 --> 01:15:28.639 align:start position:0%
does a little Le team need 150,000 no
 
01:15:30.910 --> 01:15:30.920 align:start position:0%
Now understand that all these facilities
 
01:15:32.709 --> 01:15:32.719 align:start position:0%
aren't the same we have big ones we have
 
01:15:34.950 --> 01:15:34.960 align:start position:0%
small ones the bigger numbers that you
 
01:15:36.669 --> 01:15:36.679 align:start position:0%
see on that list come from the bigger
 
01:15:39.590 --> 01:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
facilities like the brook Chasers is
 
01:15:41.070 --> 01:15:41.080 align:start position:0%
actually even though it doesn't have
 
01:15:43.750 --> 01:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
historic racing Chasers is one of the
 
01:15:45.629 --> 01:15:45.639 align:start position:0%
top Revenue
 
01:15:49.550 --> 01:15:49.560 align:start position:0%
generators so so yes there is no
 
01:15:53.030 --> 01:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
question that we need to to do something
 
01:15:55.430 --> 01:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
about this I'm going to read to you
 
01:15:59.030 --> 01:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
recommendation 17 of the from the report
 
01:16:02.310 --> 01:16:02.320 align:start position:0%
which um representative Ames is the
 
01:16:05.149 --> 01:16:05.159 align:start position:0%
report if you watch if everybody Mr
 
01:16:08.229 --> 01:16:08.239 align:start position:0%
chair May might be helpful if if I were
 
01:16:10.310 --> 01:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
able to get everybody a copy of that not
 
01:16:14.149 --> 01:16:14.159 align:start position:0%
all the appendices are in this uh but um
 
01:16:15.750 --> 01:16:15.760 align:start position:0%
but this is what's this is what uh
 
01:16:18.310 --> 01:16:18.320 align:start position:0%
recommendation 17 here was the question
 
01:16:20.430 --> 01:16:20.440 align:start position:0%
should there be limits to how much a
 
01:16:22.629 --> 01:16:22.639 align:start position:0%
charity can earn from its annual
 
01:16:24.910 --> 01:16:24.920 align:start position:0%
engagement and here's the dialogue that
 
01:16:26.310 --> 01:16:26.320 align:start position:0%
went on as the charitable Gaming
 
01:16:28.590 --> 01:16:28.600 align:start position:0%
facilities increase in growth so will
 
01:16:30.709 --> 01:16:30.719 align:start position:0%
the revenue individual Charities will
 
01:16:34.350 --> 01:16:34.360 align:start position:0%
get in 2023 800 Charities benefited from
 
01:16:36.070 --> 01:16:36.080 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming the commission
 
01:16:37.590 --> 01:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
conducted a survey participating
 
01:16:41.310 --> 01:16:41.320 align:start position:0%
Charities and learned that 91% uh of
 
01:16:43.189 --> 01:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
sponsored Charities say that charitable
 
01:16:44.950 --> 01:16:44.960 align:start position:0%
Gaming revenue is very important to
 
01:16:46.990 --> 01:16:47.000 align:start position:0%
their organizational charit charitable
 
01:16:49.830 --> 01:16:49.840 align:start position:0%
activities we also heard testimony from
 
01:16:52.270 --> 01:16:52.280 align:start position:0%
Charities not yet involved in charitable
 
01:16:53.990 --> 01:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
gaming indicating it was very difficult
 
01:16:55.629 --> 01:16:55.639 align:start position:0%
to secure dates
 
01:16:57.470 --> 01:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
from this discussion and earlier
 
01:17:01.070 --> 01:17:01.080 align:start position:0%
discussions it became clear that the the
 
01:17:03.629 --> 01:17:03.639 align:start position:0%
unavailability of dates the growing size
 
01:17:06.310 --> 01:17:06.320 align:start position:0%
of earnings by those who have been
 
01:17:08.750 --> 01:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
receiving dates the need to for
 
01:17:10.510 --> 01:17:10.520 align:start position:0%
accountability of how charity spend
 
01:17:14.110 --> 01:17:14.120 align:start position:0%
their earnings and how the Charities are
 
01:17:16.910 --> 01:17:16.920 align:start position:0%
chosen to receive dates are all linked
 
01:17:19.390 --> 01:17:19.400 align:start position:0%
together as that an issue that needs
 
01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:20.510 align:start position:0%
together as that an issue that needs
further

01:17:20.510 --> 01:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
further
 
01:17:23.750 --> 01:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
study the concept introduced was having
 
01:17:26.750 --> 01:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
a um I and I introduce this concept
 
01:17:29.910 --> 01:17:29.920 align:start position:0%
perhaps we should look at uh at these
 
01:17:32.270 --> 01:17:32.280 align:start position:0%
nonprofits from the based on their
 
01:17:35.510 --> 01:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
mission based on what they do based on
 
01:17:38.350 --> 01:17:38.360 align:start position:0%
where their monies go but we ran out of
 
01:17:41.990 --> 01:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
time to finish that that research on
 
01:17:46.229 --> 01:17:46.239 align:start position:0%
this so the so the commission agreed
 
01:17:49.070 --> 01:17:49.080 align:start position:0%
that these issues needed further study
 
01:17:51.310 --> 01:17:51.320 align:start position:0%
so here's the recommendation with that
 
01:17:52.709 --> 01:17:52.719 align:start position:0%
the commission recommends that the
 
01:17:55.030 --> 01:17:55.040 align:start position:0%
legislature vote to continue the to
 
01:17:57.189 --> 01:17:57.199 align:start position:0%
study this issue via the proposed
 
01:17:59.470 --> 01:17:59.480 align:start position:0%
creation of a joint committee of the
 
01:18:01.430 --> 01:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
House and Senate shown and as
 
01:18:03.470 --> 01:18:03.480 align:start position:0%
recommendation 25 in this
 
01:18:06.149 --> 01:18:06.159 align:start position:0%
report so as it turns
 
01:18:08.189 --> 01:18:08.199 align:start position:0%
out you folks have already passed
 
01:18:10.149 --> 01:18:10.159 align:start position:0%
something and well out of this committee
 
01:18:12.350 --> 01:18:12.360 align:start position:0%
16 to nothing to create another
 
01:18:14.310 --> 01:18:14.320 align:start position:0%
commission or to continue the work of
 
01:18:16.350 --> 01:18:16.360 align:start position:0%
the commission and this is kind of a
 
01:18:17.990 --> 01:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
hybrid commission when I read this I
 
01:18:20.669 --> 01:18:20.679 align:start position:0%
read this commission here uh UI
 
01:18:23.629 --> 01:18:23.639 align:start position:0%
commission allows uh the the Senators
 
01:18:25.470 --> 01:18:25.480 align:start position:0%
and in reps but then there's also
 
01:18:28.149 --> 01:18:28.159 align:start position:0%
outside members and they also have a
 
01:18:30.189 --> 01:18:30.199 align:start position:0%
vote this commission is different it
 
01:18:32.910 --> 01:18:32.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't allow a vote which is fine but
 
01:18:34.669 --> 01:18:34.679 align:start position:0%
it does have a representative from
 
01:18:37.350 --> 01:18:37.360 align:start position:0%
Lottery and a representative from uh uh
 
01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:38.629 align:start position:0%
Lottery and a representative from uh uh
AG's

01:18:38.629 --> 01:18:38.639 align:start position:0%
AG's
 
01:18:42.350 --> 01:18:42.360 align:start position:0%
office uh that get that or or
 
01:18:45.590 --> 01:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
representative from those offices uh to
 
01:18:48.430 --> 01:18:48.440 align:start position:0%
participate as members but I'll just
 
01:18:50.990 --> 01:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
tell you that both of those this is an
 
01:18:53.590 --> 01:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
aside both of those when we did this
 
01:18:55.709 --> 01:18:55.719 align:start position:0%
report they were both Representatives on
 
01:18:58.870 --> 01:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
the our commission chose not to vote
 
01:19:00.669 --> 01:19:00.679 align:start position:0%
because they were state agencies that
 
01:19:02.550 --> 01:19:02.560 align:start position:0%
didn't believe they should vote but
 
01:19:04.550 --> 01:19:04.560 align:start position:0%
anyway you have a mechanism it's going
 
01:19:06.229 --> 01:19:06.239 align:start position:0%
to be on the floor this week probably
 
01:19:09.270 --> 01:19:09.280 align:start position:0%
going to pass um and I I strongly
 
01:19:11.510 --> 01:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
recommend and let me let me just close
 
01:19:15.430 --> 01:19:15.440 align:start position:0%
with this uh again I have the uppermost
 
01:19:17.750 --> 01:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
regard for for representative Ames but
 
01:19:20.950 --> 01:19:20.960 align:start position:0%
here's here's what my concerns are this
 
01:19:23.470 --> 01:19:23.480 align:start position:0%
really hurts the large Charities that
 
01:19:26.910 --> 01:19:26.920 align:start position:0%
depend on these revenues and we and
 
01:19:27.950 --> 01:19:27.960 align:start position:0%
you're probably going to hear from some
 
01:19:31.830 --> 01:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
of them uh that there are some that
 
01:19:34.709 --> 01:19:34.719 align:start position:0%
really need 100,000 or 125,000 not
 
01:19:36.830 --> 01:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
everybody does their missions are such
 
01:19:39.510 --> 01:19:39.520 align:start position:0%
that they do this would harm those those
 
01:19:41.910 --> 01:19:41.920 align:start position:0%
Charities if we pass this
 
01:19:45.550 --> 01:19:45.560 align:start position:0%
bill and the fiscal note says that $18
 
01:19:47.790 --> 01:19:47.800 align:start position:0%
million will be taken away from
 
01:19:50.390 --> 01:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
Charities if you go to the fiscal note
 
01:19:53.950 --> 01:19:53.960 align:start position:0%
on this and it and it go to the state
 
01:19:55.430 --> 01:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
which means it's going to to go to the
 
01:19:56.750 --> 01:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
education trust
 
01:19:56.760 --> 01:19:58.350 align:start position:0%
education trust
fund

01:19:58.350 --> 01:19:58.360 align:start position:0%
fund
 
01:20:02.430 --> 01:20:02.440 align:start position:0%
um it so that's something that we we
 
01:20:04.590 --> 01:20:04.600 align:start position:0%
never contemplated we were trying to get
 
01:20:05.870 --> 01:20:05.880 align:start position:0%
and the commission we were trying to get
 
01:20:07.870 --> 01:20:07.880 align:start position:0%
more Charities involved how do we get
 
01:20:10.390 --> 01:20:10.400 align:start position:0%
more Charities involved by trimming
 
01:20:12.430 --> 01:20:12.440 align:start position:0%
making sure that we we weren't
 
01:20:14.270 --> 01:20:14.280 align:start position:0%
overspending on it because there a long
 
01:20:16.709 --> 01:20:16.719 align:start position:0%
list of Charities that are still trying
 
01:20:19.470 --> 01:20:19.480 align:start position:0%
to get charitable gaming this is a
 
01:20:22.310 --> 01:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
unique New Hampshire concept it's really
 
01:20:24.910 --> 01:20:24.920 align:start position:0%
works that's why that's why I sponsor
 
01:20:27.910 --> 01:20:27.920 align:start position:0%
the along with representative um duet
 
01:20:30.350 --> 01:20:30.360 align:start position:0%
the historic racing machines the goal
 
01:20:33.750 --> 01:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
was to make more Charities have more
 
01:20:35.709 --> 01:20:35.719 align:start position:0%
Revenue available for more Charities and
 
01:20:37.790 --> 01:20:37.800 align:start position:0%
we did double the number of Charities
 
01:20:40.590 --> 01:20:40.600 align:start position:0%
that were involved from that bill
 
01:20:44.470 --> 01:20:44.480 align:start position:0%
so um so again I think this is go to the
 
01:20:46.030 --> 01:20:46.040 align:start position:0%
commission that was just formed to
 
01:20:47.709 --> 01:20:47.719 align:start position:0%
really thoroughly look at this issue
 
01:20:49.910 --> 01:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
01:20:53.350 --> 01:20:53.360 align:start position:0%
former representative abrami um and as U
 
01:20:55.270 --> 01:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
commission chair of the charitable
 
01:20:57.229 --> 01:20:57.239 align:start position:0%
Gaming Commission of which I was on as
 
01:21:00.790 --> 01:21:00.800 align:start position:0%
well um it's it's good to hear from you
 
01:21:04.149 --> 01:21:04.159 align:start position:0%
and I have I have can I address perp
 
01:21:07.229 --> 01:21:07.239 align:start position:0%
andul you you read it right in the
 
01:21:10.709 --> 01:21:10.719 align:start position:0%
statute this it says 50,000 for uh games
 
01:21:15.310 --> 01:21:15.320 align:start position:0%
of chance and it says 50,000 for um um
 
01:21:17.950 --> 01:21:17.960 align:start position:0%
charitable game uh for historic racing
 
01:21:19.669 --> 01:21:19.679 align:start position:0%
the reason it's in two sections because
 
01:21:22.110 --> 01:21:22.120 align:start position:0%
the statutes there's the there's the
 
01:21:24.229 --> 01:21:24.239 align:start position:0%
games of chance statute and then there's
 
01:21:26.709 --> 01:21:26.719 align:start position:0%
the uh racing statute and historic
 
01:21:29.590 --> 01:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
racings in the racing statute uh but my
 
01:21:31.550 --> 01:21:31.560 align:start position:0%
read of that is what I think your read
 
01:21:34.189 --> 01:21:34.199 align:start position:0%
was that it would uh depending on how
 
01:21:37.189 --> 01:21:37.199 align:start position:0%
much uh was generated any given of 10
 
01:21:40.350 --> 01:21:40.360 align:start position:0%
days would be capped if for a charity be
 
01:21:42.189 --> 01:21:42.199 align:start position:0%
tapped at 50,000 if it came from table
 
01:21:45.070 --> 01:21:45.080 align:start position:0%
games and it'll be capped at 50,000 if
 
01:21:46.830 --> 01:21:46.840 align:start position:0%
it came from historic racing games
 
01:21:49.990 --> 01:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
that's the way I read it so thank you
 
01:21:51.750 --> 01:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative ducet thank you
 
01:21:54.189 --> 01:21:54.199 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and just real briefly the the
 
01:21:57.189 --> 01:21:57.199 align:start position:0%
uh as an aside the there's been an
 
01:22:00.470 --> 01:22:00.480 align:start position:0%
amendment to the commission and both the
 
01:22:03.709 --> 01:22:03.719 align:start position:0%
AG and the uh Lottery director are not
 
01:22:06.590 --> 01:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
voting members okay if if it passes with
 
01:22:09.030 --> 01:22:09.040 align:start position:0%
the amendment because of that concern we
 
01:22:11.310 --> 01:22:11.320 align:start position:0%
had so in a nutshell you'd agree that
 
01:22:12.870 --> 01:22:12.880 align:start position:0%
this is something that should be under
 
01:22:15.550 --> 01:22:15.560 align:start position:0%
the purview of what I expect to be the
 
01:22:18.030 --> 01:22:18.040 align:start position:0%
next charal gaming commission abut this
 
01:22:20.910 --> 01:22:20.920 align:start position:0%
is this is one small component of right
 
01:22:22.870 --> 01:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
a plethora of issues that have to be
 
01:22:24.950 --> 01:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
addressed dates and how the dates are
 
01:22:26.990 --> 01:22:27.000 align:start position:0%
selected how the charity is collected
 
01:22:29.149 --> 01:22:29.159 align:start position:0%
how many days per charity and on and on
 
01:22:31.950 --> 01:22:31.960 align:start position:0%
and on exactly yeah do dollars is part
 
01:22:34.030 --> 01:22:34.040 align:start position:0%
of the comp and there were a lot of
 
01:22:36.149 --> 01:22:36.159 align:start position:0%
other issues related to CH to U
 
01:22:38.750 --> 01:22:38.760 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming that I'm not going to
 
01:22:40.950 --> 01:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
bore you if you get the report you go to
 
01:22:43.229 --> 01:22:43.239 align:start position:0%
work commit 25 there are a lot of issues
 
01:22:45.070 --> 01:22:45.080 align:start position:0%
that need to be addressed still
 
01:22:47.310 --> 01:22:47.320 align:start position:0%
including problem gambling uh things
 
01:22:49.590 --> 01:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
like that that we we touched on we
 
01:22:52.510 --> 01:22:52.520 align:start position:0%
actually had another uh consult we used
 
01:22:54.950 --> 01:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
an consult outside consultant uh that
 
01:22:58.070 --> 01:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
helped us uh with with all of this and
 
01:22:59.229 --> 01:22:59.239 align:start position:0%
uh but I'm G leave it at that because
 
01:23:00.149 --> 01:23:00.159 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of other people want to
 
01:23:03.470 --> 01:23:03.480 align:start position:0%
speak elmy
 
01:23:06.310 --> 01:23:06.320 align:start position:0%
you just a quick followup so would you
 
01:23:08.390 --> 01:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
concur with my read on this that this
 
01:23:10.310 --> 01:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
would change the model we have oh
 
01:23:12.910 --> 01:23:12.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely change thank all right I
 
01:23:16.110 --> 01:23:16.120 align:start position:0%
represent El me thank you uh I just want
 
01:23:21.229 --> 01:23:21.239 align:start position:0%
to know what you mean by the 10.1% the
 
01:23:25.149 --> 01:23:25.159 align:start position:0%
27.5 and the 62 oh that's that simply I
 
01:23:28.070 --> 01:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
grouped the f i i that the
 
01:23:31.070 --> 01:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
62% on you have though you've got the
 
01:23:33.030 --> 01:23:33.040 align:start position:0%
percent of Charities that are getting
 
01:23:36.270 --> 01:23:36.280 align:start position:0%
those different amounts right 34.7 next
 
01:23:38.990 --> 01:23:39.000 align:start position:0%
to that you have 62 yeah that added the
 
01:23:42.590 --> 01:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
first two so from 0 to 50,000 it was 62%
 
01:23:46.270 --> 01:23:46.280 align:start position:0%
of the Charities of the Charities right
 
01:23:48.750 --> 01:23:48.760 align:start position:0%
so 62 62% of the Charities make between
 
01:23:51.149 --> 01:23:51.159 align:start position:0%
0 and 50,000
 
01:23:53.550 --> 01:23:53.560 align:start position:0%
27.5% of the Charities make between
 
01:23:57.110 --> 01:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
thank you 50 ,000 and and 100,000 and so
 
01:24:00.669 --> 01:24:00.679 align:start position:0%
on and again on this chart that the
 
01:24:03.709 --> 01:24:03.719 align:start position:0%
04 is represented it's three Charities
 
01:24:05.590 --> 01:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
this was dated from
 
01:24:08.350 --> 01:24:08.360 align:start position:0%
2023 two Charities that made around
 
01:24:08.360 --> 01:24:09.550 align:start position:0%
2023 two Charities that made around
about

01:24:09.550 --> 01:24:09.560 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:24:12.229 --> 01:24:12.239 align:start position:0%
155,000 each and then there was one that
 
01:24:13.590 --> 01:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
made actually made
 
01:24:17.550 --> 01:24:17.560 align:start position:0%
180,000 that was on there so again
 
01:24:18.629 --> 01:24:18.639 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of work that needs to be
 
01:24:20.990 --> 01:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
done on this and I I I think I think
 
01:24:23.669 --> 01:24:23.679 align:start position:0%
representative Ames would agree that let
 
01:24:26.750 --> 01:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
let's let this go to the commission to
 
01:24:29.870 --> 01:24:29.880 align:start position:0%
vet thank you any other questions
 
01:24:32.830 --> 01:24:32.840 align:start position:0%
representative om yeah thank you uh
 
01:24:34.669 --> 01:24:34.679 align:start position:0%
former refer Ramy and thank you much for
 
01:24:36.470 --> 01:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
your service on Ways and Means and your
 
01:24:38.790 --> 01:24:38.800 align:start position:0%
wisdom on the whole process I have a
 
01:24:41.070 --> 01:24:41.080 align:start position:0%
very difficult question I'd like to
 
01:24:44.430 --> 01:24:44.440 align:start position:0%
ask our commission our committee is
 
01:24:46.510 --> 01:24:46.520 align:start position:0%
designed to raise money for the general
 
01:24:48.629 --> 01:24:48.639 align:start position:0%
fund to the benefit of New
 
01:24:50.590 --> 01:24:50.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the charge of our
 
01:24:52.510 --> 01:24:52.520 align:start position:0%
commission is not necessarily to decide
 
01:24:55.750 --> 01:24:55.760 align:start position:0%
the allocation of the fund we raise but
 
01:24:57.830 --> 01:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
just try to raise as much we can and
 
01:24:59.510 --> 01:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
turn over to people who are smarter than
 
01:25:02.350 --> 01:25:02.360 align:start position:0%
us who can set these very very difficult
 
01:25:04.430 --> 01:25:04.440 align:start position:0%
priorities and how to spend the limited
 
01:25:07.669 --> 01:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
money that we have so my very tough
 
01:25:10.470 --> 01:25:10.480 align:start position:0%
question is should we have any money at
 
01:25:13.750 --> 01:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
all being designated through our tax law
 
01:25:16.189 --> 01:25:16.199 align:start position:0%
going to Charities or should the
 
01:25:18.629 --> 01:25:18.639 align:start position:0%
Charities compete for all the terrible
 
01:25:21.390 --> 01:25:21.400 align:start position:0%
needs we have on an equal basis in the
 
01:25:26.189 --> 01:25:26.199 align:start position:0%
finance committee so then it's simple we
 
01:25:27.750 --> 01:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
might as well not call this charitable
 
01:25:31.830 --> 01:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
gaming and uh again it's a unique model
 
01:25:34.430 --> 01:25:34.440 align:start position:0%
uh again there's over 800 Charities now
 
01:25:36.350 --> 01:25:36.360 align:start position:0%
that are involved good luck trying to
 
01:25:39.990 --> 01:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
dismantle it okay I mean it's helping
 
01:25:42.430 --> 01:25:42.440 align:start position:0%
too many too many organizations is
 
01:25:44.629 --> 01:25:44.639 align:start position:0%
helping and again that's the way I got
 
01:25:46.629 --> 01:25:46.639 align:start position:0%
involved in this it really does help a
 
01:25:47.470 --> 01:25:47.480 align:start position:0%
lot of
 
01:25:51.390 --> 01:25:51.400 align:start position:0%
organizations and uh remember the state
 
01:25:54.510 --> 01:25:54.520 align:start position:0%
since we put historic racing in place
 
01:25:56.310 --> 01:25:56.320 align:start position:0%
the revenue that the state I don't know
 
01:25:57.830 --> 01:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
if I brought it with me here but the
 
01:26:00.750 --> 01:26:00.760 align:start position:0%
revenue that the and I see
 
01:26:03.910 --> 01:26:03.920 align:start position:0%
um commission the executive director uh
 
01:26:07.030 --> 01:26:07.040 align:start position:0%
is here from Lottery uh he may be able
 
01:26:09.229 --> 01:26:09.239 align:start position:0%
to speak to this but those revenues have
 
01:26:12.030 --> 01:26:12.040 align:start position:0%
doubled tripled uh what goes to the
 
01:26:14.870 --> 01:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
state it's it's it's all boats have been
 
01:26:16.669 --> 01:26:16.679 align:start position:0%
raisen what what goes to the facilities
 
01:26:18.350 --> 01:26:18.360 align:start position:0%
what goes to the Charities increased as
 
01:26:22.390 --> 01:26:22.400 align:start position:0%
well as what goes to the state so um I I
 
01:26:23.750 --> 01:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
don't think we really want to dismantle
 
01:26:24.950 --> 01:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
this model
 
01:26:26.669 --> 01:26:26.679 align:start position:0%
it it really does
 
01:26:30.750 --> 01:26:30.760 align:start position:0%
work thank you uh representative
 
01:26:33.390 --> 01:26:33.400 align:start position:0%
alberger thank you Mr chair thank you
 
01:26:35.070 --> 01:26:35.080 align:start position:0%
for coming in today it was a pleasure to
 
01:26:36.990 --> 01:26:37.000 align:start position:0%
meet you after having heard about you
 
01:26:38.790 --> 01:26:38.800 align:start position:0%
for so long we met each other outside
 
01:26:42.950 --> 01:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
yes um I'm trying to formulate the words
 
01:26:45.149 --> 01:26:45.159 align:start position:0%
here because I'm trying to be clear
 
01:26:48.030 --> 01:26:48.040 align:start position:0%
about my question so it I may stumble
 
01:26:49.590 --> 01:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
through it a little
 
01:26:52.950 --> 01:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
bit the charitable institutions that are
 
01:26:56.510 --> 01:26:56.520 align:start position:0%
receiving funds through
 
01:26:59.350 --> 01:26:59.360 align:start position:0%
gaming in part are doing the work
 
01:27:02.149 --> 01:27:02.159 align:start position:0%
they're doing because the state is not
 
01:27:05.109 --> 01:27:05.119 align:start position:0%
taking its responsibility to provide
 
01:27:07.430 --> 01:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
those Services would would you agree
 
01:27:08.750 --> 01:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
with that
 
01:27:11.270 --> 01:27:11.280 align:start position:0%
statement for for some of them not all
 
01:27:14.070 --> 01:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
of them okay
 
01:27:16.709 --> 01:27:16.719 align:start position:0%
um I was going to say in my open remarks
 
01:27:18.550 --> 01:27:18.560 align:start position:0%
that it's a misnomer that we're even
 
01:27:21.030 --> 01:27:21.040 align:start position:0%
calling it charitable gaming it's really
 
01:27:23.750 --> 01:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
not for-profit gaming because these are
 
01:27:26.189 --> 01:27:26.199 align:start position:0%
not for profits a lot of the manaa
 
01:27:29.189 --> 01:27:29.199 align:start position:0%
profits uh and it has a lot of the
 
01:27:30.950 --> 01:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
501c uh
 
01:27:34.510 --> 01:27:34.520 align:start position:0%
categories that are there that are all
 
01:27:35.830 --> 01:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
over the place that's something else
 
01:27:37.430 --> 01:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
that can be addressed we we started to
 
01:27:40.070 --> 01:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
address it in the commission but you you
 
01:27:41.709 --> 01:27:41.719 align:start position:0%
I gave you the list purposely so you
 
01:27:43.629 --> 01:27:43.639 align:start position:0%
could just gaze and see the kind of
 
01:27:47.590 --> 01:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
organizations that are being helped okay
 
01:27:52.189 --> 01:27:52.199 align:start position:0%
and um uh you know this literally
 
01:27:54.270 --> 01:27:54.280 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the state no but we're
 
01:27:55.790 --> 01:27:55.800 align:start position:0%
helping a lot of little
 
01:27:58.910 --> 01:27:58.920 align:start position:0%
leaks but is Easter Seals being helped
 
01:28:01.510 --> 01:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
yes you know but every state that has
 
01:28:03.390 --> 01:28:03.400 align:start position:0%
other Revenue more Revenue sources than
 
01:28:06.229 --> 01:28:06.239 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire have all these things they
 
01:28:08.149 --> 01:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
have all these na for profits that that
 
01:28:11.470 --> 01:28:11.480 align:start position:0%
do good work so okay one one followup
 
01:28:15.709 --> 01:28:15.719 align:start position:0%
and then um um I think we'll move on I
 
01:28:17.830 --> 01:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
and I I noticed when I mentioned that
 
01:28:19.470 --> 01:28:19.480 align:start position:0%
that a couple of the people in the
 
01:28:21.390 --> 01:28:21.400 align:start position:0%
audience were
 
01:28:24.109 --> 01:28:24.119 align:start position:0%
nodding I in addition I'm concerned
 
01:28:24.119 --> 01:28:25.510 align:start position:0%
nodding I in addition I'm concerned
concerned

01:28:25.510 --> 01:28:25.520 align:start position:0%
concerned
 
01:28:28.270 --> 01:28:28.280 align:start position:0%
that we're not looking at vetting what
 
01:28:30.709 --> 01:28:30.719 align:start position:0%
the services to the community are that
 
01:28:33.510 --> 01:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
some of these organizations are getting
 
01:28:37.310 --> 01:28:37.320 align:start position:0%
and was this part of what we're and I'm
 
01:28:39.310 --> 01:28:39.320 align:start position:0%
specifically thinking about a group that
 
01:28:41.590 --> 01:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
I really enjoyed listening to but I'm
 
01:28:43.470 --> 01:28:43.480 align:start position:0%
not sure why we are supporting the New
 
01:28:45.870 --> 01:28:45.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State Police bagpipe band
 
01:28:47.669 --> 01:28:47.679 align:start position:0%
actually that that was in I think what I
 
01:28:51.790 --> 01:28:51.800 align:start position:0%
just read in that issue was um number 17
 
01:28:54.430 --> 01:28:54.440 align:start position:0%
it was uh

development director there and I like to
 
01:41:10.910 --> 01:41:10.920 align:start position:0%
just share my thoughts and concerns on
 
01:41:13.629 --> 01:41:13.639 align:start position:0%
House Bill 531 I've had the great uh
 
01:41:15.830 --> 01:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
Fortune of leading several nonprofits
 
01:41:18.709 --> 01:41:18.719 align:start position:0%
since 2000 I was actually part in New
 
01:41:20.189 --> 01:41:20.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I was actually part of the
 
01:41:22.629 --> 01:41:22.639 align:start position:0%
first ever charitable gaming night at
 
01:41:24.030 --> 01:41:24.040 align:start position:0%
Rockingham Park
 
01:41:26.310 --> 01:41:26.320 align:start position:0%
and I've got to see this grow over that
 
01:41:29.149 --> 01:41:29.159 align:start position:0%
time and the money raised for nonprofits
 
01:41:30.669 --> 01:41:30.679 align:start position:0%
around the states obviously had a
 
01:41:33.550 --> 01:41:33.560 align:start position:0%
tremendous impact uh more than anything
 
01:41:35.870 --> 01:41:35.880 align:start position:0%
that the state could provide us you know
 
01:41:37.709 --> 01:41:37.719 align:start position:0%
the money is making positive changes for
 
01:41:40.109 --> 01:41:40.119 align:start position:0%
so many of our citizens as you know
 
01:41:41.430 --> 01:41:41.440 align:start position:0%
charities in this room and Charities
 
01:41:42.910 --> 01:41:42.920 align:start position:0%
around the state rely on this Revenue to
 
01:41:44.510 --> 01:41:44.520 align:start position:0%
support the great work that's being done
 
01:41:46.550 --> 01:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
directly in our local communities and
 
01:41:48.709 --> 01:41:48.719 align:start position:0%
around the state many Charities that
 
01:41:50.430 --> 01:41:50.440 align:start position:0%
have a direct impact on making positive
 
01:41:52.790 --> 01:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
changes in their Community such as YMCAs
 
01:41:54.390 --> 01:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
boys and girls girl clubs mental health
 
01:41:56.669 --> 01:41:56.679 align:start position:0%
organizations elderly service providers
 
01:41:59.070 --> 01:41:59.080 align:start position:0%
Meals on Wheels disability services and
 
01:42:00.669 --> 01:42:00.679 align:start position:0%
all the great Charities that are in this
 
01:42:02.870 --> 01:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
room um they've been able to grow and
 
01:42:04.470 --> 01:42:04.480 align:start position:0%
increase services to their communities
 
01:42:05.950 --> 01:42:05.960 align:start position:0%
and address some of the most critical
 
01:42:08.390 --> 01:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
issues that a lot of you face every day
 
01:42:10.709 --> 01:42:10.719 align:start position:0%
in those seats some of those include
 
01:42:12.669 --> 01:42:12.679 align:start position:0%
homelessness substance misuse mental
 
01:42:15.189 --> 01:42:15.199 align:start position:0%
health Child Care Suicide Prevention and
 
01:42:19.149 --> 01:42:19.159 align:start position:0%
a lot more than that other service
 
01:42:21.669 --> 01:42:21.679 align:start position:0%
organizations such as quanas rotary kns
 
01:42:23.950 --> 01:42:23.960 align:start position:0%
of Columbus those types of organizations
 
01:42:25.830 --> 01:42:25.840 align:start position:0%
um they might not have a direct impact
 
01:42:27.709 --> 01:42:27.719 align:start position:0%
on their communities but those
 
01:42:29.950 --> 01:42:29.960 align:start position:0%
organizations that used to raise $5,000
 
01:42:32.350 --> 01:42:32.360 align:start position:0%
a year through bake sales and Raffles
 
01:42:33.870 --> 01:42:33.880 align:start position:0%
are now making a lot more money that
 
01:42:36.149 --> 01:42:36.159 align:start position:0%
they then support local charities and
 
01:42:38.270 --> 01:42:38.280 align:start position:0%
have a much bigger impact so those
 
01:42:41.149 --> 01:42:41.159 align:start position:0%
dollars are increasing in many different
 
01:42:43.550 --> 01:42:43.560 align:start position:0%
ways and really truly making a
 
01:42:46.950 --> 01:42:46.960 align:start position:0%
difference so um now those organizations
 
01:42:48.990 --> 01:42:49.000 align:start position:0%
like those uh can make a Luder impact
 
01:42:50.070 --> 01:42:50.080 align:start position:0%
because they've been participating in
 
01:42:52.189 --> 01:42:52.199 align:start position:0%
the games a chance uh Granite State
 
01:42:53.750 --> 01:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
Independent Living iates through the
 
01:42:55.950 --> 01:42:55.960 align:start position:0%
Lebanon po poker room we currently don't
 
01:43:00.030 --> 01:43:00.040 align:start position:0%
fall into this category yet we hope to
 
01:43:02.229 --> 01:43:02.239 align:start position:0%
um you know but that in the near future
 
01:43:04.030 --> 01:43:04.040 align:start position:0%
but the funds we raise go directly into
 
01:43:05.790 --> 01:43:05.800 align:start position:0%
the many services we provide to people
 
01:43:07.870 --> 01:43:07.880 align:start position:0%
with disabilities throughout the state
 
01:43:09.669 --> 01:43:09.679 align:start position:0%
it helps with transportation services
 
01:43:11.669 --> 01:43:11.679 align:start position:0%
Transitional Care Home modifications and
 
01:43:13.790 --> 01:43:13.800 align:start position:0%
peer service and that's just a few of
 
01:43:16.910 --> 01:43:16.920 align:start position:0%
the 19 programs that we offer uh if we
 
01:43:20.149 --> 01:43:20.159 align:start position:0%
were fortunate to be in that category um
 
01:43:21.629 --> 01:43:21.639 align:start position:0%
like many of the other nonprofits I'd
 
01:43:22.910 --> 01:43:22.920 align:start position:0%
hope that we would be able to retain
 
01:43:24.669 --> 01:43:24.679 align:start position:0%
that money and invest it back into the
 
01:43:27.589 --> 01:43:27.599 align:start position:0%
life-changing programs um that we offer
 
01:43:29.470 --> 01:43:29.480 align:start position:0%
in same way many of the other Charities
 
01:43:31.830 --> 01:43:31.840 align:start position:0%
are able to do something that can't be
 
01:43:33.270 --> 01:43:33.280 align:start position:0%
overlooked is that the great work being
 
01:43:34.669 --> 01:43:34.679 align:start position:0%
done around the state of New Hampshire
 
01:43:37.030 --> 01:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
helps our government um to address the
 
01:43:38.830 --> 01:43:38.840 align:start position:0%
needs of its citizens in a way that the
 
01:43:41.270 --> 01:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
state budget doesn't always allow
 
01:43:42.990 --> 01:43:43.000 align:start position:0%
nonprofits are the lifeblood of our
 
01:43:46.070 --> 01:43:46.080 align:start position:0%
citizens and we view our role as uh
 
01:43:47.750 --> 01:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
nonprofits in this room and around the
 
01:43:49.790 --> 01:43:49.800 align:start position:0%
state as a way to help our legislators
 
01:43:53.430 --> 01:43:53.440 align:start position:0%
solve problems and address issues if GS
 
01:43:55.070 --> 01:43:55.080 align:start position:0%
and other nonprofits were limited in our
 
01:43:56.950 --> 01:43:56.960 align:start position:0%
ability to maximize our revenue from
 
01:43:58.790 --> 01:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
sources like charitable gaming would
 
01:44:00.629 --> 01:44:00.639 align:start position:0%
have a drastic impact on the citizens
 
01:44:03.470 --> 01:44:03.480 align:start position:0%
you all represent if the estimate of1
 
01:44:05.950 --> 01:44:05.960 align:start position:0%
18,600 per year is accurate best
 
01:44:07.990 --> 01:44:08.000 align:start position:0%
utilization of those dollars um the
 
01:44:09.350 --> 01:44:09.360 align:start position:0%
nonprofits that are in the trenches
 
01:44:11.030 --> 01:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
addressing the best use of those dollars
 
01:44:12.310 --> 01:44:12.320 align:start position:0%
would be the nonprofits that are in the
 
01:44:14.470 --> 01:44:14.480 align:start position:0%
trenches addressing those issues facing
 
01:44:17.430 --> 01:44:17.440 align:start position:0%
our citizens I ask that you deeply uh
 
01:44:18.830 --> 01:44:18.840 align:start position:0%
consider the impact that this bill could
 
01:44:20.830 --> 01:44:20.840 align:start position:0%
have on the work and nonprofits do that
 
01:44:22.589 --> 01:44:22.599 align:start position:0%
we do day in and day out make New
 
01:44:23.709 --> 01:44:23.719 align:start position:0%

01:45:24.350 --> 01:45:24.360 align:start position:0%
people with emergency financial
 
01:45:26.910 --> 01:45:26.920 align:start position:0%
assistance that's not ready not readily
 
01:45:29.350 --> 01:45:29.360 align:start position:0%
available through other resources and we
 
01:45:31.830 --> 01:45:31.840 align:start position:0%
are very much a Grassroots
 
01:45:35.629 --> 01:45:35.639 align:start position:0%
nonprofit um our primary focus um
 
01:45:38.030 --> 01:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
initially was to assist individuals and
 
01:45:41.550 --> 01:45:41.560 align:start position:0%
families in Barnstead Deerfield Epsom
 
01:45:44.629 --> 01:45:44.639 align:start position:0%
Pittsfield North Northwood and straford
 
01:45:48.790 --> 01:45:48.800 align:start position:0%
but the need is really um amazingly our
 
01:45:50.430 --> 01:45:50.440 align:start position:0%
eyes are open to the need throughout the
 
01:45:52.430 --> 01:45:52.440 align:start position:0%
state where there are not organizations
 
01:45:56.750 --> 01:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
like ours and so we um partner with all
 
01:45:58.470 --> 01:45:58.480 align:start position:0%
communities to provide as much
 
01:46:00.430 --> 01:46:00.440 align:start position:0%
assistance as we can so it's not limited
 
01:46:05.709 --> 01:46:05.719 align:start position:0%
to our original area of uh help um let
 
01:46:08.030 --> 01:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
need my glasses for um prior to
 
01:46:10.229 --> 01:46:10.239 align:start position:0%
charitable gamings help our funding was
 
01:46:12.790 --> 01:46:12.800 align:start position:0%
extremely tight um we were limited to
 
01:46:15.350 --> 01:46:15.360 align:start position:0%
small individual donations and in an
 
01:46:19.070 --> 01:46:19.080 align:start position:0%
annual 5K event that um brought in maybe
 
01:46:22.109 --> 01:46:22.119 align:start position:0%
a couple thousand dollars so we really
 
01:46:24.709 --> 01:46:24.719 align:start position:0%
didn't have a a lot of um opportunity to
 
01:46:27.030 --> 01:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
do the Outreach and meet as many needs
 
01:46:28.350 --> 01:46:28.360 align:start position:0%
as we wanted
 
01:46:32.550 --> 01:46:32.560 align:start position:0%
to um I'll give you an example of uh a
 
01:46:34.310 --> 01:46:34.320 align:start position:0%
family that we were able to help or
 
01:46:35.550 --> 01:46:35.560 align:start position:0%
families actually there were three
 
01:46:37.790 --> 01:46:37.800 align:start position:0%
families in a nearby community who are
 
01:46:39.750 --> 01:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
recently forced from their homes due to
 
01:46:42.390 --> 01:46:42.400 align:start position:0%
a fire in a multif family building
 
01:46:44.470 --> 01:46:44.480 align:start position:0%
because Catamount woman a has funds from
 
01:46:47.070 --> 01:46:47.080 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming it allowed us to react
 
01:46:49.910 --> 01:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
quickly and provide assistance for their
 
01:46:52.470 --> 01:46:52.480 align:start position:0%
most immediate basic needs for um
 
01:46:55.910 --> 01:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
clothing food Etc without the funds from
 
01:46:57.870 --> 01:46:57.880 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming we will very likely
 
01:46:59.669 --> 01:46:59.679 align:start position:0%
have to turn away some requests and
 
01:47:02.149 --> 01:47:02.159 align:start position:0%
minimize the help that we can
 
01:47:05.149 --> 01:47:05.159 align:start position:0%
offer um we and many other nonprofit
 
01:47:07.149 --> 01:47:07.159 align:start position:0%
organizations are extremely grateful for
 
01:47:09.149 --> 01:47:09.159 align:start position:0%
what the charitable gaming funds have
 
01:47:11.189 --> 01:47:11.199 align:start position:0%
allowed us to provide for New Hampshire
 
01:47:13.510 --> 01:47:13.520 align:start position:0%
families and we see more and more people
 
01:47:16.629 --> 01:47:16.639 align:start position:0%

potentially double soccer is not just

other mental health challenges soccer

supportive relationships and develop

positive mindsets however the cost of
 
01:48:53.030 --> 01:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
par participation can be a barrier for
 
01:48:55.470 --> 01:48:55.480 align:start position:0%
some families by utilizing charitable
 
01:48:57.950 --> 01:48:57.960 align:start position:0%
gaming we can reduce these Financial
 
01:49:00.189 --> 01:49:00.199 align:start position:0%
obstacles charitable gaming has allowed
 
01:49:02.430 --> 01:49:02.440 align:start position:0%
us to scholarship athletes that wouldn't
 
01:49:04.390 --> 01:49:04.400 align:start position:0%
normally be able to afford to play we
 
01:49:05.830 --> 01:49:05.840 align:start position:0%
are able to create new adaptive
 
01:49:08.950 --> 01:49:08.960 align:start position:0%
programming such as ampute soccer blind
 
01:49:11.629 --> 01:49:11.639 align:start position:0%

within the local soccer Community House
 
01:49:23.270 --> 01:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
Bill 531 would put organ organiz ations
 
01:49:25.830 --> 01:49:25.840 align:start position:0%
like ours at risk we are a nonprofit who
 
01:49:27.990 --> 01:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
rely on these funds to serve our members
 
01:49:30.229 --> 01:49:30.239 align:start position:0%
our members and clubs are also nonprofit
 
01:49:32.070 --> 01:49:32.080 align:start position:0%

French language culture and Heritage and
 
01:50:34.510 --> 01:50:34.520 align:start position:0%

learning and organizing social and
 
01:50:42.470 --> 01:50:42.480 align:start position:0%
cultural events uh roughly 23% of the
 
01:50:44.270 --> 01:50:44.280 align:start position:0%
population of New Hampshire has French
 
01:50:47.189 --> 01:50:47.199 align:start position:0%
or French Canadian Heritage so uh we've
 
01:50:48.629 --> 01:50:48.639 align:start position:0%
got a lot of people we're trying to
 
01:50:52.350 --> 01:50:52.360 align:start position:0%
serve but um with regard to this bill
 
01:50:54.470 --> 01:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm hoping that in the interest of
 
01:50:56.790 --> 01:50:56.800 align:start position:0%
my brevity I will score some points with
 
01:51:00.629 --> 01:51:00.639 align:start position:0%
you um it is an opposition there's two
 
01:51:02.149 --> 01:51:02.159 align:start position:0%
aspects of the bill that I'd like to
 
01:51:04.550 --> 01:51:04.560 align:start position:0%
touch on that I don't think that uh have
 
01:51:08.790 --> 01:51:08.800 align:start position:0%
been touched on yet uh one of them is um
 
01:51:12.310 --> 01:51:12.320 align:start position:0%
with regard to the money uh the Surplus
 
01:51:13.750 --> 01:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
over the
 
01:51:18.069 --> 01:51:18.079 align:start position:0%
$50,000 going into the state trust fund
 
01:51:20.790 --> 01:51:20.800 align:start position:0%
that uh is for education and it would
 
01:51:23.470 --> 01:51:23.480 align:start position:0%
change the concept of charitable gaming
 
01:51:25.430 --> 01:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
to the concept of charitable and
 
01:51:29.310 --> 01:51:29.320 align:start position:0%
educational gaming uh and help to fund
 
01:51:34.069 --> 01:51:34.079 align:start position:0%
education in a way that would um perhaps
 
01:51:36.510 --> 01:51:36.520 align:start position:0%
um take away from our nonprofit
 
01:51:38.990 --> 01:51:39.000 align:start position:0%
community that needs it so much uh the
 
01:51:41.870 --> 01:51:41.880 align:start position:0%
second piece is that the bill would uh
 
01:51:46.470 --> 01:51:46.480 align:start position:0%
as written go into effect uh on July 1st
 
01:51:50.910 --> 01:51:50.920 align:start position:0%
uh that would uh essentially take and uh
 
01:51:53.910 --> 01:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
half the nonprofits in the state that
 
01:51:56.430 --> 01:51:56.440 align:start position:0%
are in the third and fourth quarters and
 
01:52:00.310 --> 01:52:00.320 align:start position:0%
penalize them while favoring the first
 
01:52:03.589 --> 01:52:03.599 align:start position:0%
two quarters of the year so I would ask
 
01:52:05.550 --> 01:52:05.560 align:start position:0%
that if you did choose to move forward
 
01:52:07.830 --> 01:52:07.840 align:start position:0%
with some version that you look at
 
01:52:12.069 --> 01:52:12.079 align:start position:0%
moving the date for Effective Beyond
 
01:52:16.629 --> 01:52:16.639 align:start position:0%
this year the 2025 year uh thank you
 
01:52:19.550 --> 01:52:19.560 align:start position:0%
very much for your time and uh the
 
01:52:21.830 --> 01:52:21.840 align:start position:0%
difficult decisions that you deal with
 
01:52:28.310 --> 01:52:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:39.390 --> 01:52:39.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:43.510 --> 01:52:43.520 align:start position:0%
Roa morning again uh Tom do roza with um
 
01:52:46.149 --> 01:52:46.159 align:start position:0%
principal at Main Street strategic we uh
 
01:52:47.990 --> 01:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
represent the New Hampshire Center for
 
01:52:50.350 --> 01:52:50.360 align:start position:0%
nonprofits uh and here in opposition to
 
01:52:52.629 --> 01:52:52.639 align:start position:0%
HP 531
 
01:52:53.830 --> 01:52:53.840 align:start position:0%
uh the center is a nonprofit
 
01:52:55.149 --> 01:52:55.159 align:start position:0%
organization we have more than 800
 
01:52:56.950 --> 01:52:56.960 align:start position:0%
members dedicated to strengthening and
 
01:52:58.750 --> 01:52:58.760 align:start position:0%
amplifying the voice of New Hampshire's
 
01:53:00.950 --> 01:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
nonprofit sector through leadership
 
01:53:03.669 --> 01:53:03.679 align:start position:0%
collaboration and learning opportunities
 
01:53:05.149 --> 01:53:05.159 align:start position:0%
and in the interest of time I will not
 
01:53:06.910 --> 01:53:06.920 align:start position:0%
repeat what has been heard and what you
 
01:53:08.310 --> 01:53:08.320 align:start position:0%
will continue to hear I do want to
 
01:53:10.510 --> 01:53:10.520 align:start position:0%
emphasize as former representative
 
01:53:12.709 --> 01:53:12.719 align:start position:0%
abrami stated already uh we need to
 
01:53:14.030 --> 01:53:14.040 align:start position:0%
recognize New Hampshire does not have
 
01:53:15.669 --> 01:53:15.679 align:start position:0%
legalized gaming in the traditional
 
01:53:18.149 --> 01:53:18.159 align:start position:0%
sense right instead our state allows
 
01:53:19.950 --> 01:53:19.960 align:start position:0%
gaming exclusively when it is sponsored
 
01:53:22.189 --> 01:53:22.199 align:start position:0%
by charitable organizations we need to
 
01:53:24.109 --> 01:53:24.119 align:start position:0%
consider consider that when we think

very
 
01:57:09.109 --> 01:57:09.119 align:start position:0%
much uh good morning members of the
 
01:57:12.189 --> 01:57:12.199 align:start position:0%
committee chair um I'm Mike appleberg
 
01:57:14.149 --> 01:57:14.159 align:start position:0%
with the United Way of great and ASA um
 
01:57:16.589 --> 01:57:16.599 align:start position:0%
we're here of course as well as all my
 
01:57:20.109 --> 01:57:20.119 align:start position:0%
friends in the back opposing HB
 
01:57:22.750 --> 01:57:22.760 align:start position:0%
531 just a couple of quick points
 
01:57:25.109 --> 01:57:25.119 align:start position:0%
while we do understand the intentions
 
01:57:27.030 --> 01:57:27.040 align:start position:0%
behind regulating charitable gaming we
 
01:57:29.430 --> 01:57:29.440 align:start position:0%
believe that HP 531 will have very
 
01:57:31.510 --> 01:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
significant negative unintended
 
01:57:33.870 --> 01:57:33.880 align:start position:0%
consequences for the many organizations
 
01:57:36.069 --> 01:57:36.079 align:start position:0%
that rely heavily on these funds by
 
01:57:38.950 --> 01:57:38.960 align:start position:0%
capping the revenue of $50,000 a year we
 
01:57:41.589 --> 01:57:41.599 align:start position:0%
believe that this bill is effectively a
 
01:57:44.550 --> 01:57:44.560 align:start position:0%
tax on the nonprofit
 
01:57:47.109 --> 01:57:47.119 align:start position:0%
sector in fact it's a tax to the tune of
 
01:57:49.669 --> 01:57:49.679 align:start position:0%
$18.6 million which would be siphoned
 
01:57:51.669 --> 01:57:51.679 align:start position:0%
out of the sector and put back into the
 
01:57:54.310 --> 01:57:54.320 align:start position:0%
state's offers charitable organizations
 
01:57:56.350 --> 01:57:56.360 align:start position:0%
play crucial role in addressing various
 
01:57:58.510 --> 01:57:58.520 align:start position:0%
social issues as you've heard including
 
01:58:00.790 --> 01:58:00.800 align:start position:0%
poverty education healthc Care and More
 
01:58:02.109 --> 01:58:02.119 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire nonprofits have a
 
01:58:03.830 --> 01:58:03.840 align:start position:0%
tremendous impact in our communities
 
01:58:05.669 --> 01:58:05.679 align:start position:0%
providing essential Services creating
 
01:58:08.270 --> 01:58:08.280 align:start position:0%
jobs and fostering a sense of community
 
01:58:10.990 --> 01:58:11.000 align:start position:0%
limiting their funding will hinder their
 
01:58:13.189 --> 01:58:13.199 align:start position:0%
efforts and negatively impact the lives
 
01:58:15.350 --> 01:58:15.360 align:start position:0%
of those dep that depend on all of our
 
01:58:18.109 --> 01:58:18.119 align:start position:0%
services additionally we do not believe
 
01:58:20.669 --> 01:58:20.679 align:start position:0%
that that siphoning off these funds from
 
01:58:22.350 --> 01:58:22.360 align:start position:0%
the nonprofit sector into the general
 
01:58:24.109 --> 01:58:24.119 align:start position:0%
fund aligns with the original purpose
 
01:58:25.790 --> 01:58:25.800 align:start position:0%
and intent of charitable gaming in the
 
01:58:26.910 --> 01:58:26.920 align:start position:0%
state of New
 
01:58:29.790 --> 01:58:29.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if as representative Ames
 
01:58:32.149 --> 01:58:32.159 align:start position:0%
stated the purpose is to be more
 
01:58:33.550 --> 01:58:33.560 align:start position:0%
Equitable with regards to the
 
01:58:35.069 --> 01:58:35.079 align:start position:0%
organizations that benefit from
 
01:58:37.229 --> 01:58:37.239 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming why would we in fact
 
01:58:38.870 --> 01:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
take those funds out of the sector
 
01:58:41.350 --> 01:58:41.360 align:start position:0%
altogether that makes absolutely no
 
01:58:43.589 --> 01:58:43.599 align:start position:0%
sense given these concerns we
 
01:58:45.390 --> 01:58:45.400 align:start position:0%
respectfully request that the committee
 
01:58:48.510 --> 01:58:48.520 align:start position:0%
vote HP 531 in expedient to legislate
 
01:58:50.069 --> 01:58:50.079 align:start position:0%
and we urge you to consider the broader
 
01:58:51.870 --> 01:58:51.880 align:start position:0%
implications of this Bill thank you for

02:00:44.589 --> 02:00:44.599 align:start position:0%
be open to that well that's actually
 
02:00:46.589 --> 02:00:46.599 align:start position:0%
been talked about and of course you know
 
02:00:48.870 --> 02:00:48.880 align:start position:0%
United Way United ways across the
 
02:00:51.950 --> 02:00:51.960 align:start position:0%
country started as Community funds for
 
02:00:54.750 --> 02:00:54.760 align:start position:0%
ially the purpose of Distributing um
 
02:00:57.510 --> 02:00:57.520 align:start position:0%
funding to nonprofits in their
 
02:01:00.510 --> 02:01:00.520 align:start position:0%
communities um I think that's a that's a
 
02:01:04.310 --> 02:01:04.320 align:start position:0%
worthy topic to take up I don't we are
 
02:01:08.510 --> 02:01:08.520 align:start position:0%
not opposed to the cap per se we're
 
02:01:11.310 --> 02:01:11.320 align:start position:0%
opposed to taking funds out of the
 
02:01:14.390 --> 02:01:14.400 align:start position:0%
sector what you're suggesting is
 
02:01:16.709 --> 02:01:16.719 align:start position:0%
absolutely a possibility and something
 
02:01:18.510 --> 02:01:18.520 align:start position:0%
we and I'm sure many other nonprofits
 
02:01:20.470 --> 02:01:20.480 align:start position:0%
would be glad to be part of that
 
02:01:27.750 --> 02:01:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:30.629 --> 02:01:30.639 align:start position:0%
you one more question from R shamber
 
02:01:32.189 --> 02:01:32.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you sir for
 
02:01:33.990 --> 02:01:34.000 align:start position:0%
taking this you probably can speak for
 
02:01:35.109 --> 02:01:35.119 align:start position:0%
all the
 
02:01:38.510 --> 02:01:38.520 align:start position:0%
organizations uh all this money that is
 
02:01:41.589 --> 02:01:41.599 align:start position:0%
uh uh one in these
 
02:01:45.149 --> 02:01:45.159 align:start position:0%
casinos uh charitable gaming do you do
 
02:01:47.310 --> 02:01:47.320 align:start position:0%
audits to and do you publish your audits
 
02:01:50.870 --> 02:01:50.880 align:start position:0%
from the money that is uh won there and
 
02:01:53.550 --> 02:01:53.560 align:start position:0%
is the public allowed to review those
 
02:01:57.470 --> 02:01:57.480 align:start position:0%
audits well every um so every
 
02:01:59.669 --> 02:01:59.679 align:start position:0%
nonprofit is either subject to audit or
 
02:02:01.430 --> 02:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
not subject audit based on their annual
 
02:02:04.830 --> 02:02:04.840 align:start position:0%
revenues our revenues as are many of
 
02:02:07.470 --> 02:02:07.480 align:start position:0%
those colleagues behind me are in fact
 
02:02:10.109 --> 02:02:10.119 align:start position:0%
large enough to have public Audits and
 
02:02:12.990 --> 02:02:13.000 align:start position:0%
audit records our audit we believe in
 
02:02:15.430 --> 02:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
transparency to the painful extreme our
 
02:02:17.270 --> 02:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
two audits if you'd care to review those
 
02:02:19.790 --> 02:02:19.800 align:start position:0%
are on our website um for the past two
 
02:02:22.950 --> 02:02:22.960 align:start position:0%

thank you sir thank you get one more
 
02:02:35.069 --> 02:02:35.079 align:start position:0%
question represent will U comparing to
 
02:02:37.629 --> 02:02:37.639 align:start position:0%
all of the not for-profits it's my
 
02:02:39.669 --> 02:02:39.679 align:start position:0%
understanding that 990 forms need to be
 
02:02:42.669 --> 02:02:42.679 align:start position:0%
filed by all of them if they're uh
 
02:02:46.229 --> 02:02:46.239 align:start position:0%
federally registered or they generate WR
 
02:02:48.950 --> 02:02:48.960 align:start position:0%
any revenue of any kind I know that the
 
02:02:52.189 --> 02:02:52.199 align:start position:0%
organization that organizations to which
 
02:02:54.950 --> 02:02:54.960 align:start position:0%
I belong are required to file
 
02:02:58.149 --> 02:02:58.159 align:start position:0%
990s is that your understanding as well
 
02:03:01.229 --> 02:03:01.239 align:start position:0%
well 990 is it's just like the 1040 is a
 
02:03:03.350 --> 02:03:03.360 align:start position:0%
person right there's a 990 and there's
 
02:03:05.310 --> 02:03:05.320 align:start position:0%
like a short form 990 for smaller
 
02:03:08.149 --> 02:03:08.159 align:start position:0%
organizations we file the standard 990
 
02:03:10.589 --> 02:03:10.599 align:start position:0%

transitional housing program in New

Hampshire uh we are in Dober we're a
 
02:03:43.910 --> 02:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
small agency uh we're a $500,000 budget
 
02:03:47.790 --> 02:03:47.800 align:start position:0%
agency Bare Bones we serve upwards of 30
 
02:03:51.430 --> 02:03:51.440 align:start position:0%
people every day men women and children
 
02:03:54.870 --> 02:03:54.880 align:start position:0%
this bill would our agency we
 
02:03:56.990 --> 02:03:57.000 align:start position:0%
are contracted with the state and the
 
02:04:01.149 --> 02:04:01.159 align:start position:0%
state gives us $27 a day it costs us $55
 
02:04:03.709 --> 02:04:03.719 align:start position:0%
a day to serve individuals so we have to
 
02:04:05.629 --> 02:04:05.639 align:start position:0%
fund raise the balance of that
 
02:04:08.830 --> 02:04:08.840 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming which includes Bingo
 
02:04:12.350 --> 02:04:12.360 align:start position:0%
we last year took in
 
02:04:14.950 --> 02:04:14.960 align:start position:0%
$135,000 if we have if we that was
 
02:04:16.149 --> 02:04:16.159 align:start position:0%
capped at
 
02:04:19.189 --> 02:04:19.199 align:start position:0%
$50,000 we would not be able to serve
 
02:04:20.830 --> 02:04:20.840 align:start position:0%
the people that we serve and
 
02:04:24.229 --> 02:04:24.239 align:start position:0%
unfortunately our agency isn't uh
 
02:04:26.270 --> 02:04:26.280 align:start position:0%
although it is kind of warm and fuzzy
 
02:04:28.589 --> 02:04:28.599 align:start position:0%
it's crucial people will die if we're
 
02:04:31.189 --> 02:04:31.199 align:start position:0%
not there especially in the temperatures
 
02:04:33.470 --> 02:04:33.480 align:start position:0%
that we're seeing right now I can't
 
02:04:36.870 --> 02:04:36.880 align:start position:0%
express how much this bill would crucify
 
02:04:36.880 --> 02:04:40.229 align:start position:0%
express how much this bill would crucify
our

02:04:40.229 --> 02:04:40.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:45.549 --> 02:04:45.559 align:start position:0%

hospitals Pearl Manor fund I stand
 
02:05:20.589 --> 02:05:20.599 align:start position:0%
before you today not representing any of
 
02:05:22.149 --> 02:05:22.159 align:start position:0%
those nonprofits
 
02:05:24.390 --> 02:05:24.400 align:start position:0%
but rather as a voice to the thousands
 
02:05:25.950 --> 02:05:25.960 align:start position:0%
of nonprofits in New Hampshire and the
 
02:05:28.109 --> 02:05:28.119 align:start position:0%
dedicated volunteers and philanthropists
 
02:05:30.189 --> 02:05:30.199 align:start position:0%
that support those organizations as
 
02:05:31.669 --> 02:05:31.679 align:start position:0%
everyone knows charitable gaming is a
 
02:05:33.470 --> 02:05:33.480 align:start position:0%
major funding source for many nonprofits
 
02:05:35.350 --> 02:05:35.360 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire countless Charities
 
02:05:37.709 --> 02:05:37.719 align:start position:0%
rely on charitable gaming to fund
 
02:05:40.270 --> 02:05:40.280 align:start position:0%
programs and support those in need and
 
02:05:41.750 --> 02:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
today that mission critical Revenue
 
02:05:44.310 --> 02:05:44.320 align:start position:0%
stream is at risk for the Charities and
 
02:05:45.669 --> 02:05:45.679 align:start position:0%
most importantly for the vulnerable
 
02:05:49.069 --> 02:05:49.079 align:start position:0%
citizens uh that rely on those Charities
 
02:05:50.830 --> 02:05:50.840 align:start position:0%
I was personally involved in helping the
 
02:05:52.430 --> 02:05:52.440 align:start position:0%
make A- Wish Foundation of New Hampshire
 
02:05:54.270 --> 02:05:54.280 align:start position:0%
start the process of engaging in
 
02:05:57.350 --> 02:05:57.360 align:start position:0%
charitable G charitable gaming in 2020
 
02:05:59.270 --> 02:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
and since then uh revenue from
 
02:06:00.790 --> 02:06:00.800 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming donations for make
 
02:06:03.350 --> 02:06:03.360 align:start position:0%
aish specifically has increased every
 
02:06:05.109 --> 02:06:05.119 align:start position:0%
year funds from charitable gaming
 
02:06:07.270 --> 02:06:07.280 align:start position:0%
directly impacted our ability to grant
 
02:06:09.669 --> 02:06:09.679 align:start position:0%
wishes to over 30 children with
 
02:06:11.750 --> 02:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
life-threatening medical conditions the
 
02:06:13.109 --> 02:06:13.119 align:start position:0%
revenue from charitable gaming has
 
02:06:14.669 --> 02:06:14.679 align:start position:0%
become a critical component of our
 
02:06:16.430 --> 02:06:16.440 align:start position:0%
annual budget and it's allowed us to
 
02:06:17.669 --> 02:06:17.679 align:start position:0%
fulfill our mission and reach more
 
02:06:20.510 --> 02:06:20.520 align:start position:0%
children in need House Bill 531 will
 
02:06:22.310 --> 02:06:22.320 align:start position:0%
have a profoundly negative impact on
 
02:06:24.709 --> 02:06:24.719 align:start position:0%
nonprofits and most importantly the
 
02:06:26.229 --> 02:06:26.239 align:start position:0%
people that we serve and that's an
 
02:06:26.239 --> 02:06:27.549 align:start position:0%
people that we serve and that's an
unfortunate

02:06:27.549 --> 02:06:27.559 align:start position:0%
unfortunate
 
02:06:29.750 --> 02:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
situation uh the limit of
 
02:06:31.950 --> 02:06:31.960 align:start position:0%
$50,000 um is ultimately the state of
 
02:06:33.990 --> 02:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire taking Revenue away from
 
02:06:35.470 --> 02:06:35.480 align:start position:0%
critical nonprofits who serve the
 
02:06:38.149 --> 02:06:38.159 align:start position:0%
community and it destroys the work the
 
02:06:39.629 --> 02:06:39.639 align:start position:0%
Charities have put into their strategy
 
02:06:41.390 --> 02:06:41.400 align:start position:0%
to secure revenue from charitable gaming
 
02:06:43.549 --> 02:06:43.559 align:start position:0%
organizations this would be catastrophic
 
02:06:44.910 --> 02:06:44.920 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire Charities and those
 
02:06:47.589 --> 02:06:47.599 align:start position:0%

programs we support individuals long
 
02:07:54.310 --> 02:07:54.320 align:start position:0%
after their insurances have stopped
 
02:07:58.310 --> 02:07:58.320 align:start position:0%
doing so um ongoing Rehabilitation is
 
02:08:00.629 --> 02:08:00.639 align:start position:0%
something that this state and this
 
02:08:03.310 --> 02:08:03.320 align:start position:0%
country as a whole do not uh tend to
 
02:08:05.750 --> 02:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
make a priority for folks kemples will
 
02:08:07.870 --> 02:08:07.880 align:start position:0%
never turn anyone away due to inability
 
02:08:10.270 --> 02:08:10.280 align:start position:0%
to pay one of our current members
 
02:08:12.310 --> 02:08:12.320 align:start position:0%
actually attends the program for free
 
02:08:14.790 --> 02:08:14.800 align:start position:0%
and has been doing so for 23
 
02:08:17.910 --> 02:08:17.920 align:start position:0%
years uh at crimes we offer habilitative
 
02:08:19.750 --> 02:08:19.760 align:start position:0%
evidence-based programs that Foster

who have experienced severe brain trauma
 
02:08:31.109 --> 02:08:31.119 align:start position:0%
as mentioned our services are always
 
02:08:32.549 --> 02:08:32.559 align:start position:0%
financially accessible to anyone who
 
02:08:35.750 --> 02:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
would benefit in fact kemes underwrites
 
02:08:35.760 --> 02:08:36.589 align:start position:0%
would benefit in fact kemes underwrites
nearly

02:08:36.589 --> 02:08:36.599 align:start position:0%
nearly
 
02:08:39.310 --> 02:08:39.320 align:start position:0%
$300,000 in either reduced or free
 
02:08:42.189 --> 02:08:42.199 align:start position:0%
attendance every year we're deeply
 
02:08:46.030 --> 02:08:46.040 align:start position:0%
concerned about House Bill 531 for kmle
 
02:08:48.589 --> 02:08:48.599 align:start position:0%
$50,000 cap would result in a loss of
 
02:08:48.599 --> 02:08:49.510 align:start position:0%
$50,000 cap would result in a loss of
over

02:08:49.510 --> 02:08:49.520 align:start position:0%
over
 
02:08:52.109 --> 02:08:52.119 align:start position:0%
$110,000 in annual funding for our
 
02:08:54.549 --> 02:08:54.559 align:start position:0%
organization yes this is the highest
 
02:08:56.390 --> 02:08:56.400 align:start position:0%
number of charitable gaming funds we've
 
02:08:57.990 --> 02:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
ever been allocated the previous year
 
02:08:59.549 --> 02:08:59.559 align:start position:0%
was 990,000 the previous year before
 
02:09:01.669 --> 02:09:01.679 align:start position:0%
that was 60,000 we are seeing our
 
02:09:04.470 --> 02:09:04.480 align:start position:0%
partner the brook have record revenues
 
02:09:06.790 --> 02:09:06.800 align:start position:0%
that being said with the highest ever
 
02:09:09.109 --> 02:09:09.119 align:start position:0%
allocation this year to us it is also
 
02:09:10.950 --> 02:09:10.960 align:start position:0%
the highest budget deficit year that we
 
02:09:13.390 --> 02:09:13.400 align:start position:0%
are budgeting everybody's expenses are
 
02:09:13.400 --> 02:09:14.669 align:start position:0%
are budgeting everybody's expenses are
going

02:09:14.669 --> 02:09:14.679 align:start position:0%
going
 
02:09:17.310 --> 02:09:17.320 align:start position:0%
up so this significant reduction would
 
02:09:18.990 --> 02:09:19.000 align:start position:0%
directly impact our ability to deliver
 
02:09:20.950 --> 02:09:20.960 align:start position:0%
these vital Services potentially leading
 
02:09:22.750 --> 02:09:22.760 align:start position:0%
to program Cuts or limitations on the
 
02:09:24.709 --> 02:09:24.719 align:start position:0%
number of individuals we can
 
02:09:28.310 --> 02:09:28.320 align:start position:0%
serve um speeding up here the
 
02:09:30.069 --> 02:09:30.079 align:start position:0%
distribution is a really key part of our
 
02:09:33.149 --> 02:09:33.159 align:start position:0%
income uh 85% philanthropically funded
 
02:09:36.390 --> 02:09:36.400 align:start position:0%
we do not receive very much uh revenue
 
02:09:38.549 --> 02:09:38.559 align:start position:0%
from other income streams less than 10%
 
02:09:40.229 --> 02:09:40.239 align:start position:0%
from any state services including
 
02:09:40.239 --> 02:09:41.270 align:start position:0%
from any state services including
disability

02:09:41.270 --> 02:09:41.280 align:start position:0%
disability
 
02:09:44.030 --> 02:09:44.040 align:start position:0%
waivers so all of us here uh speaking
 
02:09:45.910 --> 02:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
for the room understand the need for the
 
02:09:47.109 --> 02:09:47.119 align:start position:0%
state to manage these resources
 
02:09:49.350 --> 02:09:49.360 align:start position:0%
effectively however we urge you to
 
02:09:50.910 --> 02:09:50.920 align:start position:0%
consider the broader implications of
 
02:09:52.589 --> 02:09:52.599 align:start position:0%
this bill with New Hampshire's historic
 
02:09:54.629 --> 02:09:54.639 align:start position:0%
Reliance on nonprofits to provide these
 
02:09:55.950 --> 02:09:55.960 align:start position:0%
needed Human
 
02:09:58.549 --> 02:09:58.559 align:start position:0%
Services um in conclusion we ask for you
 
02:10:00.589 --> 02:10:00.599 align:start position:0%
to go ahead and oppose and we'll also be
 
02:10:02.189 --> 02:10:02.199 align:start position:0%
speaking to 588 later so I'll get out of
 
02:10:13.470 --> 02:10:13.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:16.790 --> 02:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
you uh let's
 
02:10:21.310 --> 02:10:21.320 align:start position:0%
see Kane Kane K it's Kane under it's
 
02:10:34.109 --> 02:10:34.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:36.510 --> 02:10:36.520 align:start position:0%
okay and thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
02:10:37.750 --> 02:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
you members of the
 
02:10:40.549 --> 02:10:40.559 align:start position:0%
committee four my name is Kevin
 
02:10:42.709 --> 02:10:42.719 align:start position:0%
underiner I'm a resident of do New
 
02:10:44.750 --> 02:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I'm here speaking in
 
02:10:47.910 --> 02:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
opposition to House Bill
 
02:10:50.709 --> 02:10:50.719 align:start position:0%
531 so you've heard lots of stories from
 
02:10:52.350 --> 02:10:52.360 align:start position:0%
from many people people about how
 
02:10:54.709 --> 02:10:54.719 align:start position:0%
they're benefiting from the funds so I
 
02:10:57.589 --> 02:10:57.599 align:start position:0%
won't go into specifics in that regard
 
02:10:59.430 --> 02:10:59.440 align:start position:0%
so very quickly I suffered a major
 
02:11:01.510 --> 02:11:01.520 align:start position:0%
stroke five and a half years ago I was
 
02:11:03.870 --> 02:11:03.880 align:start position:0%
told i' never walk again I walk poorly
 
02:11:08.589 --> 02:11:08.599 align:start position:0%
now but I do walk and I relied on
 
02:11:11.669 --> 02:11:11.679 align:start position:0%
certain agencies primarily kle Center
 
02:11:15.069 --> 02:11:15.079 align:start position:0%
and project walk which is in stratum to
 
02:11:17.870 --> 02:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
get a life back after a
 
02:11:21.870 --> 02:11:21.880 align:start position:0%
stroke with regard to house Bell 531 I
 
02:11:24.270 --> 02:11:24.280 align:start position:0%
understand the complexity with
 
02:11:26.750 --> 02:11:26.760 align:start position:0%
allocating charitable
 
02:11:29.549 --> 02:11:29.559 align:start position:0%
funds doing it in the manner that this
 
02:11:32.910 --> 02:11:32.920 align:start position:0%
bill proposes I'm against that and I
 
02:11:35.030 --> 02:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
would urge the committee to look at
 
02:11:36.950 --> 02:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
doing something more timely look at
 
02:11:39.390 --> 02:11:39.400 align:start position:0%
doing something that takes a little bit
 
02:11:41.950 --> 02:11:41.960 align:start position:0%
more time into effect so that budgets
 
02:11:43.510 --> 02:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
you've heard that this will affect
 
02:11:46.510 --> 02:11:46.520 align:start position:0%
budgets so budgets are addressed so that
 
02:11:50.229 --> 02:11:50.239 align:start position:0%
things can be done more in a more stable
 
02:11:53.310 --> 02:11:53.320 align:start position:0%
way that doesn't affect organizations
 
02:11:55.870 --> 02:11:55.880 align:start position:0%
dramatically 27 years ago I moved to New
 
02:11:57.790 --> 02:11:57.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm sorry 25 years ago I moved
 
02:12:00.270 --> 02:12:00.280 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire and at that time New
 
02:12:03.069 --> 02:12:03.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was amongst the lowest states
 
02:12:05.870 --> 02:12:05.880 align:start position:0%
in the country for charitable giving we
 
02:12:08.669 --> 02:12:08.679 align:start position:0%
are now I think at number 24 that is
 
02:12:11.390 --> 02:12:11.400 align:start position:0%
really awesomely good considering the
 
02:12:14.109 --> 02:12:14.119 align:start position:0%
the economic Times you're living in
 
02:12:17.709 --> 02:12:17.719 align:start position:0%
based on that and based on this bill if
 
02:12:20.109 --> 02:12:20.119 align:start position:0%
we allocate and limit these funds that
 
02:12:22.470 --> 02:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
are charitable funds if they go into the
 
02:12:25.069 --> 02:12:25.079 align:start position:0%
state funding for the Lottery Commission
 
02:12:26.790 --> 02:12:26.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire will no longer be number
 
02:12:29.189 --> 02:12:29.199 align:start position:0%
24 in the state in the country for
 
02:12:33.229 --> 02:12:33.239 align:start position:0%
charitable giving so I think that the
 
02:12:35.830 --> 02:12:35.840 align:start position:0%
challenge that you have is what do you
 
02:12:38.350 --> 02:12:38.360 align:start position:0%
do with limited charitable funds and I
 
02:12:40.350 --> 02:12:40.360 align:start position:0%
think that a better way of doing it
 
02:12:42.510 --> 02:12:42.520 align:start position:0%
would take more input from the community
 
02:12:44.790 --> 02:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
and a little more time and especially
 
02:12:46.510 --> 02:12:46.520 align:start position:0%
don't do something right in the middle
 
02:12:49.510 --> 02:12:49.520 align:start position:0%
of a calendar year thank you very much
 
02:12:51.669 --> 02:12:51.679 align:start position:0%
and any questions
 
02:12:51.679 --> 02:12:53.270 align:start position:0%
and any questions
thank

02:12:53.270 --> 02:12:53.280 align:start position:0%
thank
 
02:13:02.430 --> 02:13:02.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:07.750 --> 02:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
much um Aon um
 
02:13:14.470 --> 02:13:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:17.109 --> 02:13:17.119 align:start position:0%
beur good
 
02:13:20.229 --> 02:13:20.239 align:start position:0%
afternoon so my name is Aaron fairhurst
 
02:13:22.030 --> 02:13:22.040 align:start position:0%
and I am the program director for the
 
02:13:24.990 --> 02:13:25.000 align:start position:0%
kmes Brain Injury center which as you've
 
02:13:27.549 --> 02:13:27.559 align:start position:0%
heard is a nonprofit organization that
 
02:13:31.270 --> 02:13:31.280 align:start position:0%
serves uh survivors of acquired brain
 
02:13:33.629 --> 02:13:33.639 align:start position:0%
injury our organization is based in
 
02:13:35.709 --> 02:13:35.719 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth New Hampshire but with our
 
02:13:37.629 --> 02:13:37.639 align:start position:0%
online program we serve residents
 
02:13:39.430 --> 02:13:39.440 align:start position:0%
throughout the state of New
 
02:13:42.310 --> 02:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire our members range in ages from
 
02:13:45.390 --> 02:13:45.400 align:start position:0%
about 20 years old to 877 years
 
02:13:49.069 --> 02:13:49.079 align:start position:0%
old like Kevin they have all experienced
 
02:13:51.669 --> 02:13:51.679 align:start position:0%
sudden life-changing Medical events that
 
02:13:54.030 --> 02:13:54.040 align:start position:0%
have completely disrupted their
 
02:13:56.910 --> 02:13:56.920 align:start position:0%
lives they are businessmen they are
 
02:13:58.669 --> 02:13:58.679 align:start position:0%
contractors they are healthc Care
 
02:14:02.189 --> 02:14:02.199 align:start position:0%
Professionals it experts Etc whose lives
 
02:14:05.510 --> 02:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
have been turned upside down for 25
 
02:14:07.549 --> 02:14:07.559 align:start position:0%
years the kemples Brain Injury center
 
02:14:09.350 --> 02:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
has provided these members with
 
02:14:12.109 --> 02:14:12.119 align:start position:0%
postacute therapeutic programming
 
02:14:14.350 --> 02:14:14.360 align:start position:0%
focused on social and communication
 
02:14:17.229 --> 02:14:17.239 align:start position:0%
skills cognitive skill building physical
 
02:14:19.430 --> 02:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
wellness mental health and
 
02:14:22.270 --> 02:14:22.280 align:start position:0%
community members participate in groups
 
02:14:24.589 --> 02:14:24.599 align:start position:0%
of their choice depending on their needs
 
02:14:26.990 --> 02:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
and their preferences member-driven
 
02:14:29.270 --> 02:14:29.280 align:start position:0%
member choice is an aspect of our
 
02:14:32.430 --> 02:14:32.440 align:start position:0%
organization that we take great pride in
 
02:14:34.790 --> 02:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
unlike medical models the kemples Brain
 
02:14:37.629 --> 02:14:37.639 align:start position:0%
Injury center does not dictate frequency
 
02:14:40.149 --> 02:14:40.159 align:start position:0%
or duration of attending our
 
02:14:42.830 --> 02:14:42.840 align:start position:0%
program instead members choose their
 
02:14:44.830 --> 02:14:44.840 align:start position:0%
level of participation based on their
 
02:14:47.589 --> 02:14:47.599 align:start position:0%
own individual needs and their own
 
02:14:50.229 --> 02:14:50.239 align:start position:0%
goals Beyond this programming and
 
02:14:52.790 --> 02:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
perhaps most importantly the kemples
 
02:14:54.910 --> 02:14:54.920 align:start position:0%
Brain Injury center provides its members
 
02:14:57.350 --> 02:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
with a safe and a welcoming
 
02:14:59.589 --> 02:14:59.599 align:start position:0%
Community this community becomes a
 
02:15:01.390 --> 02:15:01.400 align:start position:0%
foundation for members to have the
 
02:15:04.549 --> 02:15:04.559 align:start position:0%
confidence and the support to discover
 
02:15:07.589 --> 02:15:07.599 align:start position:0%
and reinvent themselves post injury
 
02:15:09.470 --> 02:15:09.480 align:start position:0%
members have shared with me that kmle
 
02:15:11.750 --> 02:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
Brain Injury center was the reason that
 
02:15:14.430 --> 02:15:14.440 align:start position:0%
they got out of bed and that it has been
 
02:15:18.270 --> 02:15:18.280 align:start position:0%
a Lifeline to them as they begin
 
02:15:21.669 --> 02:15:21.679 align:start position:0%
again as Terry mentioned k Brain Injury
 
02:15:24.149 --> 02:15:24.159 align:start position:0%
center does not turn anyone away due to
 
02:15:27.109 --> 02:15:27.119 align:start position:0%
their inability to pay this is possible
 
02:15:28.950 --> 02:15:28.960 align:start position:0%
in part because of the funding that we
 
02:15:30.589 --> 02:15:30.599 align:start position:0%
receive from New Hampshire charitable
 
02:15:33.589 --> 02:15:33.599 align:start position:0%
gaming which is roughly $150,000
 
02:15:35.870 --> 02:15:35.880 align:start position:0%
annually a loss of this funding would
 
02:15:37.990 --> 02:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
directly impact our ability to deliver
 
02:15:40.350 --> 02:15:40.360 align:start position:0%
highquality programming and essential
 
02:15:42.790 --> 02:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
supports and services to our members
 
02:15:44.669 --> 02:15:44.679 align:start position:0%
likely resulting in a limitation on
 
02:15:46.510 --> 02:15:46.520 align:start position:0%
offerings Andor the number of
 
02:15:48.350 --> 02:15:48.360 align:start position:0%
individuals that we can
 
02:15:51.189 --> 02:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
serve I'm here today to strongly urge
 
02:15:53.990 --> 02:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
the committee to oppose House Bill
 
02:15:57.310 --> 02:15:57.320 align:start position:0%
531 this this opposition will allow kmle
 
02:15:59.270 --> 02:15:59.280 align:start position:0%
Brain Injury center and other nonprofits
 
02:16:01.629 --> 02:16:01.639 align:start position:0%
alike to continue to provide supports
 
02:16:03.790 --> 02:16:03.800 align:start position:0%
and services to those in need and to
 
02:16:05.149 --> 02:16:05.159 align:start position:0%
continue to strengthen New Hampshire

thank you thank you for taking my
 
02:16:24.390 --> 02:16:24.400 align:start position:0%
question kmle uh Center I'm familiar
 
02:16:26.669 --> 02:16:26.679 align:start position:0%
with and it seems like you have a pretty
 
02:16:29.109 --> 02:16:29.119 align:start position:0%
organized uh presentation group here
 
02:16:33.150 --> 02:16:33.160 align:start position:0%
today which is terrific
 
02:16:35.870 --> 02:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
uh and you may or may not be able to
 
02:16:38.910 --> 02:16:38.920 align:start position:0%
answer this but I'm curious to know how
 
02:16:41.790 --> 02:16:41.800 align:start position:0%
what effort it took to get kemples on
 
02:16:41.800 --> 02:16:42.509 align:start position:0%
what effort it took to get kemples on
the

02:16:42.509 --> 02:16:42.519 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:16:44.790 --> 02:16:44.800 align:start position:0%
list of the
 
02:16:46.790 --> 02:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
brook and how
 
02:16:50.030 --> 02:16:50.040 align:start position:0%
long that took if it and what sort of
 
02:16:51.429 --> 02:16:51.439 align:start position:0%
effort you put in
 
02:16:53.150 --> 02:16:53.160 align:start position:0%
to uh get that and then I have a
 
02:16:55.549 --> 02:16:55.559 align:start position:0%
followup for that I'm going to turn that
 
02:16:57.389 --> 02:16:57.399 align:start position:0%
over to Terry whose development and
 
02:17:07.349 --> 02:17:07.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:09.870 --> 02:17:09.880 align:start position:0%
fine thank you for your
 
02:17:13.270 --> 02:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
question uh rep representative Malloy um
 
02:17:14.750 --> 02:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
It's a Wonderful question I'm glad I get
 
02:17:16.790 --> 02:17:16.800 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to address it so kmes
 
02:17:18.790 --> 02:17:18.800 align:start position:0%
has been partnering with the brook since
 
02:17:21.270 --> 02:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
2011 at that time we were getting paper
 
02:17:23.669 --> 02:17:23.679 align:start position:0%
checks once weekly and the total of 10
 
02:17:27.190 --> 02:17:27.200 align:start position:0%
consecutive days of gaming was around
 
02:17:30.750 --> 02:17:30.760 align:start position:0%
$14,000 um because we were so early in
 
02:17:33.469 --> 02:17:33.479 align:start position:0%
the application process um we have been
 
02:17:35.709 --> 02:17:35.719 align:start position:0%
able to maintain that relationship uh
 
02:17:38.549 --> 02:17:38.559 align:start position:0%
with the brook that said staff turnover
 
02:17:40.870 --> 02:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
uh in both locations has been an ongoing
 
02:17:43.150 --> 02:17:43.160 align:start position:0%
threat to that relationship and it is an
 
02:17:45.509 --> 02:17:45.519 align:start position:0%
annual question mark on if the funding
 
02:17:47.230 --> 02:17:47.240 align:start position:0%
will continue so I want to make sure
 
02:17:48.990 --> 02:17:49.000 align:start position:0%
that it's clear that we do not rely on
 
02:17:51.030 --> 02:17:51.040 align:start position:0%
this in our budget it is uh something
 
02:17:55.790 --> 02:17:55.800 align:start position:0%
that we hope for thoroughly Mr chair
 
02:17:58.790 --> 02:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
followup thank you anticipated my next
 
02:18:03.509 --> 02:18:03.519 align:start position:0%
question uh I want to be a little more
 
02:18:07.830 --> 02:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
specific how do you intend to maintain
 
02:18:07.840 --> 02:18:09.469 align:start position:0%
specific how do you intend to maintain
that

02:18:09.469 --> 02:18:09.479 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:18:11.389 --> 02:18:11.399 align:start position:0%
relationship the
 
02:18:14.910 --> 02:18:14.920 align:start position:0%
future so the brook um is is very candid
 
02:18:18.070 --> 02:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
with us on their expectations of being a
 
02:18:21.190 --> 02:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming partner we um are
 
02:18:23.910 --> 02:18:23.920 align:start position:0%
making sure that we acknowledge their
 
02:18:26.589 --> 02:18:26.599 align:start position:0%
efforts uh around every corner and turn
 
02:18:28.790 --> 02:18:28.800 align:start position:0%
over every stone we can uh with the
 
02:18:31.830 --> 02:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
press and um you know highlighting their
 
02:18:33.750 --> 02:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
good work and they ask this of all their
 
02:18:35.270 --> 02:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
charitable partners and it's a very fair
 
02:18:38.589 --> 02:18:38.599 align:start position:0%
ask the year in January where we submit
 
02:18:40.150 --> 02:18:40.160 align:start position:0%
a report of what we did with last year's
 
02:18:43.270 --> 02:18:43.280 align:start position:0%
funds and then we discuss back and forth
 
02:18:45.309 --> 02:18:45.319 align:start position:0%
on if it will be 10 days again when
 
02:18:47.230 --> 02:18:47.240 align:start position:0%
those days are it's all question mark
 
02:18:49.830 --> 02:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
every year but it is a conversation
 
02:18:51.389 --> 02:18:51.399 align:start position:0%
between the partners and I think all
 
02:18:52.750 --> 02:18:52.760 align:start position:0%
these organizations would share that
 
02:18:55.270 --> 02:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
with their gaming organizations um
 
02:18:57.870 --> 02:18:57.880 align:start position:0%
nothing's guaranteed it is a
 
02:19:03.190 --> 02:19:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:13.509 --> 02:19:13.519 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:17.389 --> 02:19:17.399 align:start position:0%
mle hi I'm Anne Michael and I'm with um
 
02:19:19.709 --> 02:19:19.719 align:start position:0%
fueled by kids and I'm testifying in
 
02:19:22.509 --> 02:19:22.519 align:start position:0%
opposition to H B
 
02:19:25.469 --> 02:19:25.479 align:start position:0%
531 um I'm part of the fuel by kids
 
02:19:27.950 --> 02:19:27.960 align:start position:0%
organization which is a nonprofit that
 
02:19:29.669 --> 02:19:29.679 align:start position:0%
my daughter started when she was in high
 
02:19:32.509 --> 02:19:32.519 align:start position:0%
school to provide weekend food bags for
 
02:19:33.429 --> 02:19:33.439 align:start position:0%
kids in
 
02:19:37.070 --> 02:19:37.080 align:start position:0%
Manchester in 2016 we started providing
 
02:19:40.669 --> 02:19:40.679 align:start position:0%
about 65 bags at one school and over the
 
02:19:43.709 --> 02:19:43.719 align:start position:0%
course of um these past years we've
 
02:19:47.549 --> 02:19:47.559 align:start position:0%
grown to serve 21 schools in Manchester
 
02:19:51.630 --> 02:19:51.640 align:start position:0%
and we do 1130 bags a week
 
02:19:55.990 --> 02:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
um this uh basically we don't have any
 
02:19:58.469 --> 02:19:58.479 align:start position:0%
um employees it's all
 
02:20:02.750 --> 02:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
volunteers and our uh budget is about
 
02:20:04.910 --> 02:20:04.920 align:start position:0%
$235,000 that we'll spend on the food
 
02:20:08.870 --> 02:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
this year um 35% of that comes from our
 
02:20:12.190 --> 02:20:12.200 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming um donations and just
 
02:20:15.910 --> 02:20:15.920 align:start position:0%
quickly um if there was a limit uh we
 
02:20:18.429 --> 02:20:18.439 align:start position:0%
we've started in 2020 and we had about
 
02:20:22.230 --> 02:20:22.240 align:start position:0%
$60,000 in 2020 this year it uh this
 
02:20:23.389 --> 02:20:23.399 align:start position:0%
past year was
 
02:20:25.510 --> 02:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
$85,000 so that's
 
02:20:28.670 --> 02:20:28.680 align:start position:0%
$35,000 um if there was a cap at $50,000
 
02:20:31.710 --> 02:20:31.720 align:start position:0%
that basically provides six weeks of our
 
02:20:33.510 --> 02:20:33.520 align:start position:0%
uh weekend food bags for the kids in
 
02:20:35.750 --> 02:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
Manchester or another way to look at it
 
02:20:41.190 --> 02:20:41.200 align:start position:0%
is 175 kids um for the whole year so um
 
02:20:42.870 --> 02:20:42.880 align:start position:0%
obviously that's an important part of
 
02:20:46.790 --> 02:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
our um budget and I just wanted to say
 
02:20:48.790 --> 02:20:48.800 align:start position:0%
um that I strongly urge you to reject
 
02:20:55.750 --> 02:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:57.870 --> 02:20:57.880 align:start position:0%
you okay I have
 
02:21:01.389 --> 02:21:01.399 align:start position:0%

your so I wrote this yesterday did not
 
02:21:17.750 --> 02:21:17.760 align:start position:0%

02:21:21.429 --> 02:21:21.439 align:start position:0%
been said you know I agree with can you
 
02:21:22.990 --> 02:21:23.000 align:start position:0%

02:21:26.870 --> 02:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
Goodman Goodman okay yeah the ending is
 
02:21:29.349 --> 02:21:29.359 align:start position:0%
Chicken Scratch sorry about that um I'm
 
02:21:31.110 --> 02:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
the executive director of the NASA soup
 
02:21:33.870 --> 02:21:33.880 align:start position:0%
kitchen and shelter and our mission is
 
02:21:36.190 --> 02:21:36.200 align:start position:0%
to provide food and shelter with dignity
 
02:21:38.429 --> 02:21:38.439 align:start position:0%
to individuals and families in need
 
02:21:40.429 --> 02:21:40.439 align:start position:0%
while promoting a path to Independence
 
02:21:42.990 --> 02:21:43.000 align:start position:0%
through Direct Services and Partnerships
 
02:21:44.910 --> 02:21:44.920 align:start position:0%
Partnerships with many of the nonprofits
 
02:21:47.309 --> 02:21:47.319 align:start position:0%
that have already spoken today we're
 
02:21:48.950 --> 02:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
dedicated to serving some of the most
 
02:21:51.270 --> 02:21:51.280 align:start position:0%
vulnerable members of our community
 
02:21:53.110 --> 02:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
so I appreciate the opportunity to speak
 
02:21:54.710 --> 02:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
with you today about the potential
 
02:21:56.750 --> 02:21:56.760 align:start position:0%
impact of HB
 
02:21:59.870 --> 02:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
531 last year our organization received
 
02:22:02.550 --> 02:22:02.560 align:start position:0%
nearly $100,000 in charitable gaming
 
02:22:04.830 --> 02:22:04.840 align:start position:0%
proceeds so I guess we're in that second
 
02:22:07.710 --> 02:22:07.720 align:start position:0%
group not that top top group funding
 
02:22:09.710 --> 02:22:09.720 align:start position:0%
that is critical to our ability to
 
02:22:12.510 --> 02:22:12.520 align:start position:0%
provide shelter meals and essential
 
02:22:15.230 --> 02:22:15.240 align:start position:0%
services to those in need in an annual
 
02:22:18.190 --> 02:22:18.200 align:start position:0%
budget of $3 million this is a
 
02:22:20.510 --> 02:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
significant sum that directly trans
 
02:22:22.190 --> 02:22:22.200 align:start position:0%
translates into assistance for
 
02:22:25.150 --> 02:22:25.160 align:start position:0%
struggling individuals and Families Our
 
02:22:28.550 --> 02:22:28.560 align:start position:0%
Revenue sources are diverse but fragile
 
02:22:30.870 --> 02:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
we receive approximately 12% of our
 
02:22:33.230 --> 02:22:33.240 align:start position:0%
budget from State funding um that was
 
02:22:37.070 --> 02:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned about $27 per bedight costs
 
02:22:40.190 --> 02:22:40.200 align:start position:0%
over $50 per bed night we're funded for
 
02:22:43.510 --> 02:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
46 of our beds by the state we have over
 
02:22:45.309 --> 02:22:45.319 align:start position:0%
80 beds every
 
02:22:48.030 --> 02:22:48.040 align:start position:0%
night um so those costs just don't go
 
02:22:51.110 --> 02:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
away 5% from Grants and Foundations
 
02:22:55.990 --> 02:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
5% from rental income and 53% from
 
02:22:58.630 --> 02:22:58.640 align:start position:0%
contributions and donations while
 
02:23:00.590 --> 02:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
private donations are our largest
 
02:23:03.150 --> 02:23:03.160 align:start position:0%
revenue stream fundraising is always an
 
02:23:06.469 --> 02:23:06.479 align:start position:0%
ongoing challenge nonprofits like ours
 
02:23:09.270 --> 02:23:09.280 align:start position:0%
are in constant competition for donor
 
02:23:11.670 --> 02:23:11.680 align:start position:0%
attention and economic uncertainties
 
02:23:14.469 --> 02:23:14.479 align:start position:0%
only make it more difficult to secure
 
02:23:18.269 --> 02:23:18.279 align:start position:0%
sustained sustained support furthermore
 
02:23:21.070 --> 02:23:21.080 align:start position:0%
in the current federal environment there
 
02:23:23.230 --> 02:23:23.240 align:start position:0%
is a looming risk of losing additional
 
02:23:25.269 --> 02:23:25.279 align:start position:0%
funding whether due to cuts at the
 
02:23:27.630 --> 02:23:27.640 align:start position:0%
federal level or reductions in funds
 
02:23:30.590 --> 02:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
passed down to States every dollar we
 
02:23:32.590 --> 02:23:32.600 align:start position:0%
receive is carefully allocated to
 
02:23:35.389 --> 02:23:35.399 align:start position:0%
provide Direct Services and the loss of
 
02:23:37.429 --> 02:23:37.439 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming proceeds would create
 
02:23:39.710 --> 02:23:39.720 align:start position:0%
a gap that would be difficult if not
 
02:23:42.710 --> 02:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
impossible to fill redirecting nonprofit
 
02:23:44.590 --> 02:23:44.600 align:start position:0%
Gaming revenue to the New Hampshire lot
 
02:23:46.230 --> 02:23:46.240 align:start position:0%
Lottery Commission does not strengthen
 
02:23:48.590 --> 02:23:48.600 align:start position:0%
our communities it weakens them
 
02:23:50.510 --> 02:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
organizations like ours and many of my
 
02:23:52.910 --> 02:23:52.920 align:start position:0%
peer nonprofits that are here today rely
 
02:23:54.630 --> 02:23:54.640 align:start position:0%
on this funding to meet essential needs
 
02:23:56.429 --> 02:23:56.439 align:start position:0%
that would otherwise fall to State and
 
02:23:58.790 --> 02:23:58.800 align:start position:0%
local governments instead of taking
 
02:24:00.950 --> 02:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
resources away from nonprofits we should
 
02:24:02.590 --> 02:24:02.600 align:start position:0%
be working together to ensure that
 
02:24:04.630 --> 02:24:04.640 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming continues to serve the
 
02:24:06.790 --> 02:24:06.800 align:start position:0%
very purpose it was designed for
 
02:24:09.309 --> 02:24:09.319 align:start position:0%
supporting vital work in our community I
 
02:24:11.630 --> 02:24:11.640 align:start position:0%
urge you to oppose this legislation and
 
02:24:13.230 --> 02:24:13.240 align:start position:0%
protect this essential funding source
 
02:24:16.070 --> 02:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
for nonprofits across the state thank
 
02:24:18.389 --> 02:24:18.399 align:start position:0%
you for your time thank you for your
 
02:24:24.269 --> 02:24:24.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:30.269 --> 02:24:30.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:37.910 --> 02:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:40.590 --> 02:24:40.600 align:start position:0%
Alis you got it right it's AMD just like
 
02:24:42.790 --> 02:24:42.800 align:start position:0%
Jaws like Amityville every horror movie
 
02:24:45.070 --> 02:24:45.080 align:start position:0%
I swear I'm not a
 
02:24:47.590 --> 02:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
nightmare I'm here I'm actually not a
 
02:24:49.870 --> 02:24:49.880 align:start position:0%
not for-profit I am an accounting firm
 
02:24:51.990 --> 02:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
owner that only Services nonprofits and
 
02:24:53.309 --> 02:24:53.319 align:start position:0%
I'm the only one in the state of New
 
02:24:55.590 --> 02:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so I come here with a lot of
 
02:24:57.590 --> 02:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
experience in seeing the day-to-day
 
02:24:59.550 --> 02:24:59.560 align:start position:0%
impact of charitable gaming for the
 
02:25:03.309 --> 02:25:03.319 align:start position:0%
nonprofits in our state um I would say
 
02:25:05.030 --> 02:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
for a lot of the small organizations
 
02:25:07.710 --> 02:25:07.720 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming is 20 to 40% of their
 
02:25:09.870 --> 02:25:09.880 align:start position:0%
entire budget so if we take that away
 
02:25:11.070 --> 02:25:11.080 align:start position:0%
from them it's going to have serious
 
02:25:13.349 --> 02:25:13.359 align:start position:0%
consequences on the community in the
 
02:25:15.510 --> 02:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire um I did provide
 
02:25:17.349 --> 02:25:17.359 align:start position:0%
you a letter with some more information
 
02:25:18.910 --> 02:25:18.920 align:start position:0%
if that's helpful and you're welcome to
 
02:25:21.230 --> 02:25:21.240 align:start position:0%
contact me and talk 990s
 
02:25:24.269 --> 02:25:24.279 align:start position:0%
anytime um but I just wanted to be here
 
02:25:25.910 --> 02:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
to kind of give a voice from the outside
 
02:25:27.910 --> 02:25:27.920 align:start position:0%
that gets to see on a day-to-day I love
 
02:25:31.230 --> 02:25:31.240 align:start position:0%
my job um what the positive impact is of
 
02:25:33.190 --> 02:25:33.200 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming is in the state and
 
02:25:35.670 --> 02:25:35.680 align:start position:0%
how many different types of resources it
 
02:25:37.990 --> 02:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
creates and I also wanted to point out
 
02:25:40.429 --> 02:25:40.439 align:start position:0%
too that right now um I didn't sleep
 
02:25:42.190 --> 02:25:42.200 align:start position:0%
last week I don't know about any of you
 
02:25:44.269 --> 02:25:44.279 align:start position:0%
but um a lot of my not for-profits were
 
02:25:46.150 --> 02:25:46.160 align:start position:0%
not able to access their federal funds
 
02:25:48.469 --> 02:25:48.479 align:start position:0%
last week uh the cost of living in the
 
02:25:50.550 --> 02:25:50.560 align:start position:0%
CATE of New Hampshire has grown and
 
02:25:54.910 --> 02:25:54.920 align:start position:0%
giving is down so this leads to the huge
 
02:25:57.630 --> 02:25:57.640 align:start position:0%
impact of charitable gaming has created
 
02:26:00.590 --> 02:26:00.600 align:start position:0%
to help with budget deficits in the
 
02:26:01.950 --> 02:26:01.960 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire for
 
02:26:04.150 --> 02:26:04.160 align:start position:0%
nonprofits um the other thing is is that
 
02:26:05.630 --> 02:26:05.640 align:start position:0%
the state is taking longer to pay in
 
02:26:08.269 --> 02:26:08.279 align:start position:0%
certain situations and the Saving Grace
 
02:26:10.269 --> 02:26:10.279 align:start position:0%
has been charitable gaming literally
 
02:26:13.269 --> 02:26:13.279 align:start position:0%
we've had conversations saying that you
 
02:26:14.630 --> 02:26:14.640 align:start position:0%
know maybe you should join charitable
 
02:26:16.230 --> 02:26:16.240 align:start position:0%
gaming to help build that extra 30 days
 
02:26:18.110 --> 02:26:18.120 align:start position:0%
of cash because it's now taking 60 days
 
02:26:20.389 --> 02:26:20.399 align:start position:0%
to get paid a lot of nonprofits don't
 
02:26:22.030 --> 02:26:22.040 align:start position:0%
have another 30 days of cash just
 
02:26:24.230 --> 02:26:24.240 align:start position:0%
sitting around so charitable gaming has
 
02:26:25.550 --> 02:26:25.560 align:start position:0%
been a Lifeline for a lot of
 
02:26:27.030 --> 02:26:27.040 align:start position:0%
organizations in the state in the past
 
02:26:28.870 --> 02:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
few years and they've contributed a lot
 
02:26:30.630 --> 02:26:30.640 align:start position:0%
of time and effort as some folks have
 
02:26:32.750 --> 02:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
pointed out in the lines to get into
 
02:26:34.950 --> 02:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
some of these locations and facilities
 
02:26:37.469 --> 02:26:37.479 align:start position:0%
and get on the lists so respectfully I
 
02:26:39.670 --> 02:26:39.680 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill I'm available for
 
02:26:41.990 --> 02:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
questions at any time and thank you so
 
02:26:44.429 --> 02:26:44.439 align:start position:0%
much for your service thank you very
 
02:26:47.070 --> 02:26:47.080 align:start position:0%
much now that's all I have for pin cards
 
02:26:48.870 --> 02:26:48.880 align:start position:0%
is there someone who has not testified
 
02:26:50.349 --> 02:26:50.359 align:start position:0%
who did not fill out a pin card who who
 
02:26:51.910 --> 02:26:51.920 align:start position:0%
would like to
 
02:26:55.190 --> 02:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
speak seeing none I will close the
 
02:26:59.910 --> 02:26:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:59.920 --> 02:27:02.269 align:start position:0%
 
531

02:27:02.269 --> 02:27:02.279 align:start position:0%
531
 
02:27:02.279 --> 02:27:06.190 align:start position:0%
531
okay

02:27:06.190 --> 02:27:06.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:08.190 --> 02:27:08.200 align:start position:0%
now trying to figure out how we're going
 
02:27:11.830 --> 02:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
to do the rest of our schedule here um I
 
02:27:14.590 --> 02:27:14.600 align:start position:0%
think what we're going to do is the
 
02:27:16.230 --> 02:27:16.240 align:start position:0%
committee is going to take a half hour
 
02:27:18.309 --> 02:27:18.319 align:start position:0%
lunch break instead of an hour lunch
 
02:27:20.309 --> 02:27:20.319 align:start position:0%
break we'll cut it to 1 half hour I'll
 
02:27:23.150 --> 02:27:23.160 align:start position:0%
ask committee members to be back here at
 
02:27:26.910 --> 02:27:26.920 align:start position:0%
uh 1:00 sharp because we will start um
 
02:27:29.670 --> 02:27:29.680 align:start position:0%
and we'll start at 1:00 on HB
 
02:27:33.710 --> 02:27:33.720 align:start position:0%
588 I have 14 pink cards on that one um
 
02:27:36.630 --> 02:27:36.640 align:start position:0%
we I think we underestimated the uh the
 
02:27:38.990 --> 02:27:39.000 align:start position:0%
interest in both these bills um but
 
02:27:41.110 --> 02:27:41.120 align:start position:0%
we're doing our best to um to make it
 
02:27:46.389 --> 02:27:46.399 align:start position:0%
work so so one o00 HB 588 and then when
 
02:27:50.590 --> 02:27:50.600 align:start position:0%
that's done we'll go to HP 591
 
02:27:54.349 --> 02:27:54.359 align:start position:0%
and the exact session will happen after
 
02:27:59.710 --> 02:27:59.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:59.720 --> 02:28:19.110 align:start position:0%
 
understanding

02:28:19.110 --> 02:28:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:19.120 --> 02:28:49.030 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:28:49.030 --> 02:28:49.040 align:start position:0%

historic horse racing Revenue into the
 
03:08:29.830 --> 03:08:29.840 align:start position:0%

tap table game revenues going to Charity
 
03:08:35.950 --> 03:08:35.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has licensed charitable
 
03:08:38.870 --> 03:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
Gaming facilities since
 
03:08:43.710 --> 03:08:43.720 align:start position:0%
2006 for table games such as Roulette in
 
03:08:47.630 --> 03:08:47.640 align:start position:0%
21 profits are split between the casino
 
03:08:51.150 --> 03:08:51.160 align:start position:0%
operator in Charities with a very small
 
03:08:53.750 --> 03:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
portion going to the Lottery Commission
 
03:08:56.269 --> 03:08:56.279 align:start position:0%
to cover administrative
 
03:08:59.790 --> 03:08:59.800 align:start position:0%
expenses recently there have been two
 
03:09:02.670 --> 03:09:02.680 align:start position:0%
significant developments that directly
 
03:09:04.510 --> 03:09:04.520 align:start position:0%
impact charitable
 
03:09:06.910 --> 03:09:06.920 align:start position:0%
Revenue in May of
 
03:09:09.990 --> 03:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
2022 the roll out of historic horse
 
03:09:12.910 --> 03:09:12.920 align:start position:0%
racing machines which resemble slot
 
03:09:12.920 --> 03:09:14.510 align:start position:0%
racing machines which resemble slot
machines

03:09:14.510 --> 03:09:14.520 align:start position:0%
machines
 
03:09:18.309 --> 03:09:18.319 align:start position:0%
began hundreds are already in place
 
03:09:20.950 --> 03:09:20.960 align:start position:0%
and more will be added as new and
 
03:09:23.950 --> 03:09:23.960 align:start position:0%
renovated casinos
 
03:09:27.070 --> 03:09:27.080 align:start position:0%
expand in Ju the second thing that has
 
03:09:30.429 --> 03:09:30.439 align:start position:0%
happened is in July of
 
03:09:34.110 --> 03:09:34.120 align:start position:0%
2023 the single wager limit for table g
 
03:09:38.550 --> 03:09:38.560 align:start position:0%
games increased from $10 to
 
03:09:42.389 --> 03:09:42.399 align:start position:0%
$50 gaming profits for operators and
 
03:09:45.710 --> 03:09:45.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:48.710 --> 03:09:48.720 align:start position:0%
skyrocketed the fiscal note shows this
 
03:09:53.830 --> 03:09:53.840 align:start position:0%
bill will decrease FY 26 revenue for
 
03:09:57.190 --> 03:09:57.200 align:start position:0%
Charities but when you use
 
03:09:59.990 --> 03:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
prehistoric horse rating data which
 
03:10:01.950 --> 03:10:01.960 align:start position:0%
would be
 
03:10:04.190 --> 03:10:04.200 align:start position:0%
fy22 for
 
03:10:08.150 --> 03:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
comparison they will um they will take a
 
03:10:11.990 --> 03:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
dip but they will quickly return to that
 
03:10:15.269 --> 03:10:15.279 align:start position:0%
level and then surpass that
 
03:10:18.309 --> 03:10:18.319 align:start position:0%
Benchmark as noted in the f note of the
 
03:10:20.990 --> 03:10:21.000 align:start position:0%
previous bill that you heard
 
03:10:24.590 --> 03:10:24.600 align:start position:0%
hb31 the Lottery Commission expects
 
03:10:28.309 --> 03:10:28.319 align:start position:0%
Casino profits to incre increase quote
 
03:10:32.750 --> 03:10:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:36.710 --> 03:10:36.720 align:start position:0%
future this
 
03:10:41.389 --> 03:10:41.399 align:start position:0%
um this reasonable rate that that the
 
03:10:45.590 --> 03:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
the re this this this bill will let the
 
03:10:48.429 --> 03:10:48.439 align:start position:0%
charity revenues incre increase at a
 
03:10:51.550 --> 03:10:51.560 align:start position:0%
reasonable rate and also at the same
 
03:10:57.349 --> 03:10:57.359 align:start position:0%
time provide $25 million for the next
 
03:11:01.030 --> 03:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
bium budget of the state I hope you will
 
03:11:03.269 --> 03:11:03.279 align:start position:0%
support this
 
03:11:06.510 --> 03:11:06.520 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you
 
03:11:09.349 --> 03:11:09.359 align:start position:0%
questions oh I think representative duet
 
03:11:15.950 --> 03:11:15.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:18.469 --> 03:11:18.479 align:start position:0%
question GE thank you Mr chairman thank
 
03:11:21.830 --> 03:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question I do correct
 
03:11:24.710 --> 03:11:24.720 align:start position:0%
me if I'm wrong but this basically would
 
03:11:26.870 --> 03:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
rewrite the platform we have in
 
03:11:28.790 --> 03:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming we have charitable
 
03:11:32.349 --> 03:11:32.359 align:start position:0%
gaming this this would I mean part and
 
03:11:35.469 --> 03:11:35.479 align:start position:0%
parcel of the
 
03:11:39.710 --> 03:11:39.720 align:start position:0%
HHR uh the Advent of HHR was us having
 
03:11:42.710 --> 03:11:42.720 align:start position:0%
the ability to add yet another charity
 
03:11:44.070 --> 03:11:44.080 align:start position:0%
to the Daily
 
03:11:48.830 --> 03:11:48.840 align:start position:0%
gaming um so this is a you know total
 
03:11:51.830 --> 03:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
rewrite of what we've passed we've lived
 
03:11:54.309 --> 03:11:54.319 align:start position:0%
through the years where normal gaming
 
03:11:55.830 --> 03:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
didn't pass we have a model that's
 
03:11:58.550 --> 03:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
working for charitable gaming I
 
03:12:01.229 --> 03:12:01.239 align:start position:0%
understand that there's issues with
 
03:12:04.030 --> 03:12:04.040 align:start position:0%
other components of of the state budget
 
03:12:08.070 --> 03:12:08.080 align:start position:0%
but tell me why that this makes sense
 
03:12:11.670 --> 03:12:11.680 align:start position:0%
well as I stated um charitable gaming
 
03:12:16.389 --> 03:12:16.399 align:start position:0%
started in 2006 with table games and so
 
03:12:20.110 --> 03:12:20.120 align:start position:0%
how long did we go 15 years or so with
 
03:12:22.590 --> 03:12:22.600 align:start position:0%
that model with the Charities operating
 
03:12:24.910 --> 03:12:24.920 align:start position:0%
off table games a lot of the the
 
03:12:27.190 --> 03:12:27.200 align:start position:0%
Charities that we heard testify on the
 
03:12:29.190 --> 03:12:29.200 align:start position:0%
last Bill said that they've been
 
03:12:30.790 --> 03:12:30.800 align:start position:0%
receiving their money for a very long
 
03:12:33.150 --> 03:12:33.160 align:start position:0%
time one of them mentioned
 
03:12:36.990 --> 03:12:37.000 align:start position:0%
2011 so this the historic um horse
 
03:12:40.349 --> 03:12:40.359 align:start position:0%
racing is it's in a different statute
 
03:12:44.349 --> 03:12:44.359 align:start position:0%
than the table games and um I I really
 
03:12:47.910 --> 03:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
don't think that in 2006 and anybody was
 
03:12:50.510 --> 03:12:50.520 align:start position:0%
thinking about historical horse racing
 
03:12:53.349 --> 03:12:53.359 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire so I just
 
03:12:58.030 --> 03:12:58.040 align:start position:0%
think that um this proposal continues
 
03:13:02.469 --> 03:13:02.479 align:start position:0%
what's been in in place for almost 20
 
03:13:05.469 --> 03:13:05.479 align:start position:0%
years and still allows Charities to
 
03:13:07.550 --> 03:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
they'll they'll get more money the the
 
03:13:10.550 --> 03:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
data shows us that the historical horse
 
03:13:13.830 --> 03:13:13.840 align:start position:0%
racing putting those in the casinos has
 
03:13:17.710 --> 03:13:17.720 align:start position:0%
drawn in more people that spend money on
 
03:13:20.190 --> 03:13:20.200 align:start position:0%
the historical horse racing machines and
 
03:13:22.670 --> 03:13:22.680 align:start position:0%
they also are spending more money on the
 
03:13:26.070 --> 03:13:26.080 align:start position:0%
table games which this bill does not
 
03:13:28.030 --> 03:13:28.040 align:start position:0%
touch follow
 
03:13:30.910 --> 03:13:30.920 align:start position:0%
up just I'm going to be real brief there
 
03:13:34.990 --> 03:13:35.000 align:start position:0%
there's a history of this legislature
 
03:13:36.870 --> 03:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
supporting gaming or not supporting
 
03:13:40.590 --> 03:13:40.600 align:start position:0%
gaming this legislature in years past
 
03:13:44.830 --> 03:13:44.840 align:start position:0%
moved past normal Casino operations for
 
03:13:47.630 --> 03:13:47.640 align:start position:0%
the benefit of the state
 
03:13:50.309 --> 03:13:50.319 align:start position:0%
we have a a charitable gaming model
 
03:13:54.630 --> 03:13:54.640 align:start position:0%
right now that a component is
 
03:13:58.910 --> 03:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
HHR in and I I forgive me representative
 
03:14:00.070 --> 03:14:00.080 align:start position:0%
fellows I don't know if you were here
 
03:14:02.710 --> 03:14:02.720 align:start position:0%
during the HHR debate part of that
 
03:14:05.590 --> 03:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
component was adding yet another charity
 
03:14:07.309 --> 03:14:07.319 align:start position:0%
to the pool of Charities that can
 
03:14:10.510 --> 03:14:10.520 align:start position:0%
benefit from charitable gaming we don't
 
03:14:14.630 --> 03:14:14.640 align:start position:0%
have a a model everything that was done
 
03:14:16.389 --> 03:14:16.399 align:start position:0%
was to benefit the Charities at the end
 
03:14:18.309 --> 03:14:18.319 align:start position:0%
of the day it wasn't to benefit the
 
03:14:21.870 --> 03:14:21.880 align:start position:0%
education trust fund this is a a a
 
03:14:26.429 --> 03:14:26.439 align:start position:0%
rewrite of Statute this this this let me
 
03:14:28.990 --> 03:14:29.000 align:start position:0%
let me continue my
 
03:14:31.990 --> 03:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
question the question is what my
 
03:14:36.229 --> 03:14:36.239 align:start position:0%
question is what for what purpose do you
 
03:14:38.389 --> 03:14:38.399 align:start position:0%
want to rewrite the whole model of
 
03:14:41.469 --> 03:14:41.479 align:start position:0%
charal gaming so we can cut the
 
03:14:43.990 --> 03:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
Charities off at the knees and send the
 
03:14:47.030 --> 03:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
money to Lottery to fund the education
 
03:14:49.229 --> 03:14:49.239 align:start position:0%
trust fund because that's what this in
 
03:14:52.110 --> 03:14:52.120 align:start position:0%
fact does why would you do that so I I
 
03:14:54.550 --> 03:14:54.560 align:start position:0%
don't think see this as any rewrite of
 
03:14:58.950 --> 03:14:58.960 align:start position:0%
any model that for for 20 plus for 20
 
03:15:01.110 --> 03:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
years we've had charitable gaming and it
 
03:15:04.429 --> 03:15:04.439 align:start position:0%
was based on table table games and the
 
03:15:07.429 --> 03:15:07.439 align:start position:0%
poker I you know I'm not expert in that
 
03:15:11.229 --> 03:15:11.239 align:start position:0%
details but what's new is the historical
 
03:15:11.239 --> 03:15:12.790 align:start position:0%
details but what's new is the historical
the

03:15:12.790 --> 03:15:12.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:15:17.429 --> 03:15:17.439 align:start position:0%
historical horse racing machines are new
 
03:15:19.790 --> 03:15:19.800 align:start position:0%
they've only been in they've only
 
03:15:23.910 --> 03:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
started to roll out just in May of 2022
 
03:15:25.790 --> 03:15:25.800 align:start position:0%
is when we first saw any of those
 
03:15:28.150 --> 03:15:28.160 align:start position:0%
machines and they've escalated
 
03:15:30.750 --> 03:15:30.760 align:start position:0%
dramatically you said part of your what
 
03:15:33.030 --> 03:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
you said is was to bring more money into
 
03:15:35.349 --> 03:15:35.359 align:start position:0%
the state I think that the state can
 
03:15:41.030 --> 03:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:44.750 --> 03:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
Charities okay all right um seeing no
 
03:15:51.469 --> 03:15:51.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:53.150 --> 03:15:53.160 align:start position:0%
now I have
 
03:15:55.670 --> 03:15:55.680 align:start position:0%
um this is very similar to the last one
 
03:15:57.389 --> 03:15:57.399 align:start position:0%
but I have a few less pin cards I have
 
03:16:01.349 --> 03:16:01.359 align:start position:0%
14 people who would like to speak um we
 
03:16:03.710 --> 03:16:03.720 align:start position:0%
will Implement a two-minute uh limit but
 
03:16:08.429 --> 03:16:08.439 align:start position:0%
I would also say that um I know that I I
 
03:16:10.349 --> 03:16:10.359 align:start position:0%
would guess that your your thought
 
03:16:12.429 --> 03:16:12.439 align:start position:0%
process for opposing this because every
 
03:16:14.229 --> 03:16:14.239 align:start position:0%
single one of you opposes this that I
 
03:16:16.670 --> 03:16:16.680 align:start position:0%
have a card for uh would be very similar
 
03:16:19.870 --> 03:16:19.880 align:start position:0%
to your last one so um if you can U
 
03:16:21.750 --> 03:16:21.760 align:start position:0%
summarize it or just come up and say
 
03:16:24.590 --> 03:16:24.600 align:start position:0%
you're against it whatever um I I think
 
03:16:27.870 --> 03:16:27.880 align:start position:0%
we understand the the Myriad of of
 
03:16:29.670 --> 03:16:29.680 align:start position:0%
wonderful Charities that and the work
 
03:16:32.229 --> 03:16:32.239 align:start position:0%
you're doing so um I I just want to
 
03:16:35.510 --> 03:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
avoid a repeat of the same information
 
03:16:38.389 --> 03:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
um anyways with that I'll call up uh uh
 
03:16:38.399 --> 03:16:45.229 align:start position:0%
um anyways with that I'll call up uh uh
amdy

03:16:45.229 --> 03:16:45.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:47.990 --> 03:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
Olas hello I'm am Alis you've met me
 
03:16:50.590 --> 03:16:50.600 align:start position:0%
before um I just wanted to say quickly
 
03:16:52.030 --> 03:16:52.040 align:start position:0%
on the historic horse racing because it
 
03:16:53.750 --> 03:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
did come out during the pandemic was a
 
03:16:55.429 --> 03:16:55.439 align:start position:0%
Lifeline for a lot of the Social Service
 
03:16:57.630 --> 03:16:57.640 align:start position:0%
organizations in the state and I'd just
 
03:16:59.790 --> 03:16:59.800 align:start position:0%
like everyone to consider that as part
 
03:17:03.229 --> 03:17:03.239 align:start position:0%
of the the whole opposition and the the
 
03:17:06.910 --> 03:17:06.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:14.469 --> 03:17:14.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:18.150 --> 03:17:18.160 align:start position:0%
take thank you uh and I have the next
 
03:17:19.790 --> 03:17:19.800 align:start position:0%
card is
 
03:17:28.910 --> 03:17:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:30.950 --> 03:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
Furst thank
 
03:17:30.960 --> 03:17:32.630 align:start position:0%
Furst thank

03:17:32.630 --> 03:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:17:36.150 --> 03:17:36.160 align:start position:0%
uh Kevin underminer is
 
03:17:39.309 --> 03:17:39.319 align:start position:0%
next Terry Highland on behalf of kemes
 
03:17:42.110 --> 03:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
and Kevin and Aaron
 
03:17:46.110 --> 03:17:46.120 align:start position:0%
um I want to address what uh the bill
 
03:17:48.630 --> 03:17:48.640 align:start position:0%
sponsor was just just speaking
 
03:17:52.630 --> 03:17:52.640 align:start position:0%
about and rep duet's question um about
 
03:17:55.189 --> 03:17:55.199 align:start position:0%
HHR versus games of chance and it's it's
 
03:17:57.150 --> 03:17:57.160 align:start position:0%
very relevant I just reviewed our
 
03:18:00.630 --> 03:18:00.640 align:start position:0%
standard agreement from the last year um
 
03:18:04.030 --> 03:18:04.040 align:start position:0%
with the Brooke casino and all game of
 
03:18:06.110 --> 03:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
chance revenues were removed from the
 
03:18:07.990 --> 03:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
agreement and that amount that I
 
03:18:09.910 --> 03:18:09.920 align:start position:0%
referenced last
 
03:18:12.990 --> 03:18:13.000 align:start position:0%
$160,000 in revenues was entirely from
 
03:18:14.830 --> 03:18:14.840 align:start position:0%
historic horse
 
03:18:18.469 --> 03:18:18.479 align:start position:0%
racing the brook and us a charitable
 
03:18:20.189 --> 03:18:20.199 align:start position:0%
partner make these standard agreements
 
03:18:23.510 --> 03:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
annually and they write them and we go
 
03:18:25.110 --> 03:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
back and forth and we discuss what would
 
03:18:28.349 --> 03:18:28.359 align:start position:0%
be the best strategy for everybody and
 
03:18:30.830 --> 03:18:30.840 align:start position:0%
um so I want that to be on record that
 
03:18:33.790 --> 03:18:33.800 align:start position:0%
it's not necessarily um one or the other
 
03:18:35.630 --> 03:18:35.640 align:start position:0%
or both it can be whatever in the
 
03:18:37.110 --> 03:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
standard agreement and this bill does
 
03:18:41.150 --> 03:18:41.160 align:start position:0%
nothing to protect um you know games of
 
03:18:42.950 --> 03:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
chance versus historic horse racing
 
03:18:45.389 --> 03:18:45.399 align:start position:0%
going to these Charities so again to
 
03:18:48.150 --> 03:18:48.160 align:start position:0%
repeat last year all of the revenues
 
03:18:49.630 --> 03:18:49.640 align:start position:0%
from charitable gaming to our
 
03:18:51.269 --> 03:18:51.279 align:start position:0%
organization came from historic horse
 
03:18:55.790 --> 03:18:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:58.910 --> 03:18:58.920 align:start position:0%
games thank you are there any
 
03:19:01.870 --> 03:19:01.880 align:start position:0%
questions representative just for the
 
03:19:04.830 --> 03:19:04.840 align:start position:0%
sake of clarity it's probably not what
 
03:19:07.309 --> 03:19:07.319 align:start position:0%
should have happened there should be a
 
03:19:10.349 --> 03:19:10.359 align:start position:0%
percentage split that that was well
 
03:19:13.510 --> 03:19:13.520 align:start position:0%
defined in the statute so maybe you're
 
03:19:15.030 --> 03:19:15.040 align:start position:0%
not reading it correctly I'm just
 
03:19:17.070 --> 03:19:17.080 align:start position:0%
suggesting that you take another look I
 
03:19:19.710 --> 03:19:19.720 align:start position:0%
can take at should be percentage from
 
03:19:22.870 --> 03:19:22.880 align:start position:0%
table games and a percentage from HHR we
 
03:19:25.030 --> 03:19:25.040 align:start position:0%
did get the entire take from HHR which I
 
03:19:26.590 --> 03:19:26.600 align:start position:0%
can confidently say contributed to the
 
03:19:28.590 --> 03:19:28.600 align:start position:0%
increase but potentially you're correct
 
03:19:29.710 --> 03:19:29.720 align:start position:0%
that there may have been table games as
 
03:19:33.110 --> 03:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
well yeah but even so massive increase
 
03:19:36.309 --> 03:19:36.319 align:start position:0%
because of HHR so to the point it is a
 
03:19:38.429 --> 03:19:38.439 align:start position:0%
huge part of these revenues that are
 
03:19:40.870 --> 03:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
important to these
 
03:19:43.269 --> 03:19:43.279 align:start position:0%
Charities any other questions thank you
 
03:19:49.110 --> 03:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:49.120 --> 03:19:52.469 align:start position:0%
 
P

03:19:52.469 --> 03:19:52.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:54.870 --> 03:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
bramy I don't
 
03:19:58.349 --> 03:19:58.359 align:start position:0%
know thank you Mr chair pat bramy by the
 
03:20:00.110 --> 03:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
way I'm from I'll say something new I'm
 
03:20:02.870 --> 03:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
from stratum just for the record and I'm
 
03:20:02.880 --> 03:20:04.070 align:start position:0%
from stratum just for the record and I'm
representing

03:20:04.070 --> 03:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
representing
 
03:20:04.080 --> 03:20:05.590 align:start position:0%
representing
myself

03:20:05.590 --> 03:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
myself
 
03:20:08.950 --> 03:20:08.960 align:start position:0%
um I was involved as I said earlier in
 
03:20:13.349 --> 03:20:13.359 align:start position:0%
in bringing historic racing to the state
 
03:20:16.710 --> 03:20:16.720 align:start position:0%
uh representative duet and I and I
 
03:20:20.110 --> 03:20:20.120 align:start position:0%
insisted I insisted that in that bill we
 
03:20:21.790 --> 03:20:21.800 align:start position:0%
would increase the number of Charities
 
03:20:26.670 --> 03:20:26.680 align:start position:0%
to two for every night okay which we've
 
03:20:30.469 --> 03:20:30.479 align:start position:0%
done and with the with the with the goal
 
03:20:31.910 --> 03:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
of increasing the number of Charities
 
03:20:34.870 --> 03:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
that would be benefiting from this now
 
03:20:37.269 --> 03:20:37.279 align:start position:0%
from the fiscal note of the last
 
03:20:39.510 --> 03:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
bill they said in
 
03:20:44.070 --> 03:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
2024 there were 8115 Charities that that
 
03:20:46.269 --> 03:20:46.279 align:start position:0%
received money from the games of chance
 
03:20:49.950 --> 03:20:49.960 align:start position:0%
and 698 Charities that receed money from
 
03:20:52.349 --> 03:20:52.359 align:start position:0%
HHR and that's because not every one of
 
03:20:56.710 --> 03:20:56.720 align:start position:0%
these facilities and there's 14 or so uh
 
03:21:00.349 --> 03:21:00.359 align:start position:0%
currently uh have historic racing
 
03:21:02.750 --> 03:21:02.760 align:start position:0%
machines because that technology is
 
03:21:05.389 --> 03:21:05.399 align:start position:0%
technology it's it requires certain
 
03:21:08.189 --> 03:21:08.199 align:start position:0%
Staffing and it's a l it's it's more
 
03:21:12.110 --> 03:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
complicated than it may sound so I did a
 
03:21:16.110 --> 03:21:16.120 align:start position:0%
quick math on this bill if we if very
 
03:21:17.550 --> 03:21:17.560 align:start position:0%
important thing have to do is if you
 
03:21:20.429 --> 03:21:20.439 align:start position:0%
have your bill in front of you if you go
 
03:21:23.710 --> 03:21:23.720 align:start position:0%
to line 10 and 11 of the
 
03:21:25.630 --> 03:21:25.640 align:start position:0%
bill it
 
03:21:29.710 --> 03:21:29.720 align:start position:0%
says what is crossed out is each license
 
03:21:32.870 --> 03:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
operator each ly operating historic
 
03:21:36.070 --> 03:21:36.080 align:start position:0%

03:21:38.510 --> 03:21:38.520 align:start position:0%

03:21:39.710 --> 03:21:39.720 align:start position:0%
game
 
03:21:42.309 --> 03:21:42.319 align:start position:0%
date that's crossed
 
03:21:45.630 --> 03:21:45.640 align:start position:0%
out so I would imply that says to me
 
03:21:48.229 --> 03:21:48.239 align:start position:0%
unless this bill is amended that we're
 
03:21:50.710 --> 03:21:50.720 align:start position:0%
down to one charity again per night if
 
03:21:53.469 --> 03:21:53.479 align:start position:0%
this bill passes the the way it is and I
 
03:21:56.710 --> 03:21:56.720 align:start position:0%
did a rough calculation and I said well
 
03:21:59.070 --> 03:21:59.080 align:start position:0%
let's say there's 14 facilities and and
 
03:22:00.590 --> 03:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
everybody had a 10
 
03:22:06.189 --> 03:22:06.199 align:start position:0%
days that would be about 36 36.5 slots
 
03:22:11.269 --> 03:22:11.279 align:start position:0%
for uh for uh Charities times 14
 
03:22:15.870 --> 03:22:15.880 align:start position:0%
locations that's around uh uh 511
 
03:22:15.880 --> 03:22:17.670 align:start position:0%
locations that's around uh uh 511
charities

03:22:17.670 --> 03:22:17.680 align:start position:0%
charities
 
03:22:20.429 --> 03:22:20.439 align:start position:0%
so only 511 Charities would be able to
 
03:22:21.870 --> 03:22:21.880 align:start position:0%
participate at the
 
03:22:27.269 --> 03:22:27.279 align:start position:0%
max and out of the currently 800 plus
 
03:22:30.030 --> 03:22:30.040 align:start position:0%
815 that are there so a reduction of
 
03:22:32.309 --> 03:22:32.319 align:start position:0%
about 304 Charities give or take I'm
 
03:22:34.870 --> 03:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
just estimating so that's the impact of
 
03:22:37.110 --> 03:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
this bill someone the the number of
 
03:22:38.830 --> 03:22:38.840 align:start position:0%
Charities that can participate are going
 
03:22:41.389 --> 03:22:41.399 align:start position:0%
to go away this the way the bill is
 
03:22:45.070 --> 03:22:45.080 align:start position:0%
written is no longer two Charities per
 
03:22:47.189 --> 03:22:47.199 align:start position:0%
each so
 
03:22:48.790 --> 03:22:48.800 align:start position:0%
uh you got to understand when we first
 
03:22:51.189 --> 03:22:51.199 align:start position:0%
did this bill it it took us two years to
 
03:22:54.150 --> 03:22:54.160 align:start position:0%
pass this bill uh the bill uh not this
 
03:22:56.910 --> 03:22:56.920 align:start position:0%
bill but to pass the uh historic racing
 
03:22:58.950 --> 03:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
and it was really the Charities that
 
03:23:01.790 --> 03:23:01.800 align:start position:0%
second year that came and they did
 
03:23:03.870 --> 03:23:03.880 align:start position:0%
videos they did all sorts of things that
 
03:23:05.910 --> 03:23:05.920 align:start position:0%
they would share with the legislators
 
03:23:09.389 --> 03:23:09.399 align:start position:0%
about why why this was a thing and now
 
03:23:11.550 --> 03:23:11.560 align:start position:0%
to pull this
 
03:23:15.670 --> 03:23:15.680 align:start position:0%
away uh I I I'll be you know
 
03:23:17.950 --> 03:23:17.960 align:start position:0%
respectfully I'm opposing this bill
 
03:23:21.590 --> 03:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
obviously but it's kind of a betrayal to
 
03:23:24.750 --> 03:23:24.760 align:start position:0%
these Charities you know we're changing
 
03:23:26.309 --> 03:23:26.319 align:start position:0%
the game
 
03:23:28.030 --> 03:23:28.040 align:start position:0%
Midstream I think that's what
 
03:23:29.950 --> 03:23:29.960 align:start position:0%
representative duet was trying to say
 
03:23:31.790 --> 03:23:31.800 align:start position:0%
you can't just pull the rug out from
 
03:23:34.830 --> 03:23:34.840 align:start position:0%
from all these Charities and again it's
 
03:23:38.830 --> 03:23:38.840 align:start position:0%
going to transfer $12.5 million will be
 
03:23:41.030 --> 03:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
transferred to from the Charities to the
 
03:23:42.349 --> 03:23:42.359 align:start position:0%
state and
 
03:23:44.790 --> 03:23:44.800 align:start position:0%
basically as you know the net net profit
 
03:23:46.790 --> 03:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
from Lottery all goes into the education
 
03:23:50.429 --> 03:23:50.439 align:start position:0%
trust fund so and the prime sponsor um
 
03:23:52.870 --> 03:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
is was made no quals about it that was
 
03:23:56.110 --> 03:23:56.120 align:start position:0%
the motivation for this bill we want to
 
03:23:57.510 --> 03:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
take money from the
 
03:23:59.990 --> 03:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
Charities that sounds negative but you
 
03:24:01.950 --> 03:24:01.960 align:start position:0%
want to take monies from something
 
03:24:03.309 --> 03:24:03.319 align:start position:0%
established helping a lot of Charities
 
03:24:04.550 --> 03:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
and moving it over to the education
 
03:24:08.950 --> 03:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
trust fund which was never the intent of
 
03:24:10.950 --> 03:24:10.960 align:start position:0%
what we did we we were trying to expand
 
03:24:12.150 --> 03:24:12.160 align:start position:0%
the number of Charities that can be
 
03:24:15.269 --> 03:24:15.279 align:start position:0%
involved so I would say if this bill
 
03:24:17.950 --> 03:24:17.960 align:start position:0%
were ever to get Pass unless this thing
 
03:24:19.550 --> 03:24:19.560 align:start position:0%
is the bill is
 
03:24:21.870 --> 03:24:21.880 align:start position:0%
amended you're down to one charity a
 
03:24:23.110 --> 03:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
night for a
 
03:24:26.389 --> 03:24:26.399 align:start position:0%
facility uh which is not good so that's
 
03:24:28.189 --> 03:24:28.199 align:start position:0%
all I have to say on this one thank you
 
03:24:30.189 --> 03:24:30.199 align:start position:0%
I'll take questions if any qu yes
 
03:24:30.199 --> 03:24:31.550 align:start position:0%
I'll take questions if any qu yes
representative

03:24:31.550 --> 03:24:31.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:24:35.070 --> 03:24:35.080 align:start position:0%
Malloy thank you Mr chair thank you The
 
03:24:37.389 --> 03:24:37.399 align:start position:0%
Honorable Pat abrami for taking my
 
03:24:38.990 --> 03:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
question appreciate
 
03:24:42.229 --> 03:24:42.239 align:start position:0%
it uh I'm doing some math here and I
 
03:24:45.229 --> 03:24:45.239 align:start position:0%
just see if this makes makes sense to
 
03:24:45.239 --> 03:24:46.750 align:start position:0%
just see if this makes makes sense to
you

03:24:46.750 --> 03:24:46.760 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:24:48.189 --> 03:24:48.199 align:start position:0%
uh that's the question see if this makes
 
03:24:52.349 --> 03:24:52.359 align:start position:0%
sense to you uh you there's been an
 
03:24:55.189 --> 03:24:55.199 align:start position:0%
increase in the number of Charities y
 
03:24:58.269 --> 03:24:58.279 align:start position:0%
that have benefited by this uh and I
 
03:25:01.710 --> 03:25:01.720 align:start position:0%
think you said there are
 
03:25:04.189 --> 03:25:04.199 align:start position:0%
8815 uh that
 
03:25:07.510 --> 03:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
are benefiting by by the uh gains of
 
03:25:10.269 --> 03:25:10.279 align:start position:0%
chance right and
 
03:25:13.189 --> 03:25:13.199 align:start position:0%
698 with historic horse racing right and
 
03:25:16.429 --> 03:25:16.439 align:start position:0%
so yeah uh I mean I it's I'm the going
 
03:25:17.750 --> 03:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
know from the prior Bill those two
 
03:25:22.790 --> 03:25:22.800 align:start position:0%
numbers um give or take right yeah uh I
 
03:25:26.070 --> 03:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
added that up to be 153
 
03:25:29.070 --> 03:25:29.080 align:start position:0%
1,513 is that F 1,
 
03:25:33.630 --> 03:25:33.640 align:start position:0%
1513 individual different charities no
 
03:25:35.070 --> 03:25:35.080 align:start position:0%
the the maximum number of Charity is the
 
03:25:37.870 --> 03:25:37.880 align:start position:0%
800 number because some some of the
 
03:25:39.990 --> 03:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
facilities that they're at have both
 
03:25:43.630 --> 03:25:43.640 align:start position:0%
historic racing and uh games a chance
 
03:25:45.110 --> 03:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
some don't that's why one number is
 
03:25:46.830 --> 03:25:46.840 align:start position:0%
smaller than the other
 
03:25:49.550 --> 03:25:49.560 align:start position:0%
but again what happens is if if you're
 
03:25:51.550 --> 03:25:51.560 align:start position:0%
at the brook let's say and they have
 
03:25:53.189 --> 03:25:53.199 align:start position:0%
both historic racing and they have
 
03:25:56.590 --> 03:25:56.600 align:start position:0%
charitable uh uh games of chance table
 
03:25:59.429 --> 03:25:59.439 align:start position:0%
games um basically they those monies got
 
03:26:02.469 --> 03:26:02.479 align:start position:0%
pulled together and divided
 
03:26:06.349 --> 03:26:06.359 align:start position:0%
equally from both both those they gets
 
03:26:07.750 --> 03:26:07.760 align:start position:0%
divided equally between the two
 
03:26:09.670 --> 03:26:09.680 align:start position:0%
Charities that are sponsoring that for
 
03:26:11.630 --> 03:26:11.640 align:start position:0%
those 10 days
 
03:26:14.429 --> 03:26:14.439 align:start position:0%
followup follow
 
03:26:18.630 --> 03:26:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:22.269 --> 03:26:22.279 align:start position:0%
so H followup so how many charities in
 
03:26:24.510 --> 03:26:24.520 align:start position:0%
this state are benefiting from
 
03:26:24.520 --> 03:26:25.790 align:start position:0%
this state are benefiting from
charitable

03:26:25.790 --> 03:26:25.800 align:start position:0%
charitable
 
03:26:29.830 --> 03:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
gaming what what 800 and what did I I'll
 
03:26:32.790 --> 03:26:32.800 align:start position:0%
have to look my note 800 and
 
03:26:40.309 --> 03:26:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:42.670 --> 03:26:42.680 align:start position:0%
okay okay I just wanted to say one more
 
03:26:45.750 --> 03:26:45.760 align:start position:0%
other thing Mr chair sure um if you go
 
03:26:47.630 --> 03:26:47.640 align:start position:0%
to the FIS note on this
 
03:26:51.229 --> 03:26:51.239 align:start position:0%
bill in on the last page it shows that
 
03:26:54.510 --> 03:26:54.520 align:start position:0%
right now charal organizations get 8
 
03:26:57.269 --> 03:26:57.279 align:start position:0%
point of of the historic racing money
 
03:27:00.550 --> 03:27:00.560 align:start position:0%
they get 8.7% of the gross revenue which
 
03:27:02.710 --> 03:27:02.720 align:start position:0%
is the basically they call it gross but
 
03:27:06.510 --> 03:27:06.520 align:start position:0%
it's really than that after payouts okay
 
03:27:08.030 --> 03:27:08.040 align:start position:0%
Lottery gets
 
03:27:11.429 --> 03:27:11.439 align:start position:0%
16.25 which is goes to the state and and
 
03:27:13.349 --> 03:27:13.359 align:start position:0%
The Operators get
 
03:27:15.990 --> 03:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
75% uh but if way and and the commission
 
03:27:18.750 --> 03:27:18.760 align:start position:0%
the I talked about last time we had the
 
03:27:20.790 --> 03:27:20.800 align:start position:0%
outside Consultants verify that this was
 
03:27:24.870 --> 03:27:24.880 align:start position:0%
a a fair bre split uh we that was one of
 
03:27:26.830 --> 03:27:26.840 align:start position:0%
my best questions is this Fair are we
 
03:27:30.110 --> 03:27:30.120 align:start position:0%
given the facilities too much uh came
 
03:27:34.750 --> 03:27:34.760 align:start position:0%
back they got a clean bill of health so
 
03:27:37.670 --> 03:27:37.680 align:start position:0%
again everybody as I said last time last
 
03:27:40.389 --> 03:27:40.399 align:start position:0%
for the last bill in the last two or
 
03:27:43.990 --> 03:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
three years since everybody is getting
 
03:27:46.269 --> 03:27:46.279 align:start position:0%
more the facilities are getting more the
 
03:27:49.870 --> 03:27:49.880 align:start position:0%
Charities are getting more and the um
 
03:27:51.910 --> 03:27:51.920 align:start position:0%
and the lottery is getting a lot more
 
03:27:56.469 --> 03:27:56.479 align:start position:0%
aka the state so this this program as it
 
03:27:58.950 --> 03:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
is is helping everybody including the
 
03:28:00.269 --> 03:28:00.279 align:start position:0%
state is getting a lot more Revenue
 
03:28:02.030 --> 03:28:02.040 align:start position:0%
because of
 
03:28:04.070 --> 03:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
this representa
 
03:28:07.150 --> 03:28:07.160 align:start position:0%
elberger thank you Mr chair I want to
 
03:28:09.510 --> 03:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
make sure this is only my second term so
 
03:28:11.349 --> 03:28:11.359 align:start position:0%
I want to make sure I've got some dates
 
03:28:15.110 --> 03:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
correct uh as I understand it uh the
 
03:28:17.630 --> 03:28:17.640 align:start position:0%
original bill that involved table games
 
03:28:21.550 --> 03:28:21.560 align:start position:0%
only was in 2006 and then the HHR
 
03:28:24.990 --> 03:28:25.000 align:start position:0%
machines since 2022 right that's correct
 
03:28:27.830 --> 03:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
that's correct all right in that time
 
03:28:30.950 --> 03:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
the amount of money that's gone to
 
03:28:33.590 --> 03:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
Charities has increased significantly
 
03:28:33.600 --> 03:28:36.150 align:start position:0%
Charities has increased significantly
exponentially

03:28:36.150 --> 03:28:36.160 align:start position:0%
exponentially
 
03:28:38.790 --> 03:28:38.800 align:start position:0%
exponentially followup please
 
03:28:41.070 --> 03:28:41.080 align:start position:0%
followup thank you
 
03:28:43.469 --> 03:28:43.479 align:start position:0%
uh at the same
 
03:28:48.150 --> 03:28:48.160 align:start position:0%
time our citizens property taxes have
 
03:28:51.389 --> 03:28:51.399 align:start position:0%
increased enormously because of
 
03:28:54.710 --> 03:28:54.720 align:start position:0%
diminished funding for education and
 
03:28:54.720 --> 03:28:56.750 align:start position:0%
diminished funding for education and
other

03:28:56.750 --> 03:28:56.760 align:start position:0%
other
 
03:29:00.229 --> 03:29:00.239 align:start position:0%
services how would you suggest that we
 
03:29:00.239 --> 03:29:01.469 align:start position:0%
services how would you suggest that we
tell

03:29:01.469 --> 03:29:01.479 align:start position:0%
tell
 
03:29:04.550 --> 03:29:04.560 align:start position:0%
our citizens our
 
03:29:07.189 --> 03:29:07.199 align:start position:0%
constituents we're going to let your
 
03:29:09.790 --> 03:29:09.800 align:start position:0%
property taxes keep Rising because we
 
03:29:12.229 --> 03:29:12.239 align:start position:0%
want to support Charities I mean this
 
03:29:14.349 --> 03:29:14.359 align:start position:0%
I'm not trying to bait anybody I'm
 
03:29:17.309 --> 03:29:17.319 align:start position:0%
really stuck here representative this I
 
03:29:19.469 --> 03:29:19.479 align:start position:0%
mean I'll let him answer if he wants but
 
03:29:22.070 --> 03:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
this is really more of a policy that
 
03:29:23.590 --> 03:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
that maybe we discussed during our work
 
03:29:27.349 --> 03:29:27.359 align:start position:0%
session it's it's you know if we want to
 
03:29:31.150 --> 03:29:31.160 align:start position:0%
dismantle histo General basically uh
 
03:29:34.030 --> 03:29:34.040 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming that's a bigger issue
 
03:29:36.269 --> 03:29:36.279 align:start position:0%
we partially dismantling it now you got
 
03:29:38.469 --> 03:29:38.479 align:start position:0%
to remember we had a lot less Charities
 
03:29:41.349 --> 03:29:41.359 align:start position:0%
involved before historic racing machines
 
03:29:43.429 --> 03:29:43.439 align:start position:0%
and we've we've met that goal of
 
03:29:46.830 --> 03:29:46.840 align:start position:0%
increasing that uh number of charities
 
03:29:50.110 --> 03:29:50.120 align:start position:0%
and I you know it it comes down to a a
 
03:29:51.429 --> 03:29:51.439 align:start position:0%
political decision in the part of
 
03:29:54.670 --> 03:29:54.680 align:start position:0%
everyone here you know do we want to
 
03:29:56.950 --> 03:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
want to use this as a way of funding
 
03:29:58.870 --> 03:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
education or do we want to keep on
 
03:30:00.070 --> 03:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
funding the
 
03:30:02.189 --> 03:30:02.199 align:start position:0%
Charities I I personally fall on the
 
03:30:05.110 --> 03:30:05.120 align:start position:0%
side of you know funding the Charities I
 
03:30:06.870 --> 03:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
don't like changing the the rules of the
 
03:30:07.790 --> 03:30:07.800 align:start position:0%
game in the
 
03:30:09.990 --> 03:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
middle again remember a lot of these
 
03:30:13.750 --> 03:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
Charities were involved in supporting
 
03:30:16.110 --> 03:30:16.120 align:start position:0%
bringing historic racing here and now
 
03:30:17.910 --> 03:30:17.920 align:start position:0%
we're saying 3 years later well we
 
03:30:20.710 --> 03:30:20.720 align:start position:0%
didn't really mean it you know we you
 
03:30:22.590 --> 03:30:22.600 align:start position:0%
know we're going to take that money away
 
03:30:25.269 --> 03:30:25.279 align:start position:0%
from you also is going to be less not
 
03:30:28.269 --> 03:30:28.279 align:start position:0%
only less Charities involved but the
 
03:30:29.950 --> 03:30:29.960 align:start position:0%
total amount that individual Charities
 
03:30:31.189 --> 03:30:31.199 align:start position:0%
get will also be
 
03:30:33.510 --> 03:30:33.520 align:start position:0%
reduced from the from if this bill
 
03:30:37.590 --> 03:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
passes so um leave it at that I just
 
03:30:40.309 --> 03:30:40.319 align:start position:0%
want to talk about one other thing U
 
03:30:42.429 --> 03:30:42.439 align:start position:0%
representative Aly you you brought up
 
03:30:45.990 --> 03:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
problem gambling before and we as a
 
03:30:48.110 --> 03:30:48.120 align:start position:0%
commission that wasn't our charge but we
 
03:30:50.469 --> 03:30:50.479 align:start position:0%
came up a lot so we had extra money we
 
03:30:53.429 --> 03:30:53.439 align:start position:0%
actually had 125,000 funded to bring in
 
03:30:55.910 --> 03:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
a consultant we didn't spend all of that
 
03:30:58.429 --> 03:30:58.439 align:start position:0%
so we brought in a second consultant on
 
03:31:01.030 --> 03:31:01.040 align:start position:0%
problem gaming and there's a whole
 
03:31:03.150 --> 03:31:03.160 align:start position:0%
interesting report that they came with
 
03:31:05.469 --> 03:31:05.479 align:start position:0%
all the possible solutions to problem
 
03:31:06.870 --> 03:31:06.880 align:start position:0%
gaming and and
 
03:31:09.150 --> 03:31:09.160 align:start position:0%
prevention uh that I I I think it' be
 
03:31:11.830 --> 03:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
worthy of the Comm of the ways and means
 
03:31:13.590 --> 03:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
take a Peak at uh as well it's a whole
 
03:31:15.070 --> 03:31:15.080 align:start position:0%
separate report it's an appendix that
 
03:31:17.910 --> 03:31:17.920 align:start position:0%
report and the original report from the
 
03:31:20.389 --> 03:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
uh from the consultants in there as well
 
03:31:22.309 --> 03:31:22.319 align:start position:0%
yeah we'll get a copy of that report uh
 
03:31:25.510 --> 03:31:25.520 align:start position:0%
I think that's um uh there's a lot of
 
03:31:27.110 --> 03:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
valuable information in there and we
 
03:31:29.309 --> 03:31:29.319 align:start position:0%
don't want to reinvent the wheel so yeah
 
03:31:32.110 --> 03:31:32.120 align:start position:0%
thanks for mentioning that okay uh one
 
03:31:33.990 --> 03:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
last question representative om yeah
 
03:31:37.309 --> 03:31:37.319 align:start position:0%
thanks just a quick quick clarifying
 
03:31:39.030 --> 03:31:39.040 align:start position:0%
question you said that we would be
 
03:31:41.830 --> 03:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
defunding the terrible uh organizations
 
03:31:43.630 --> 03:31:43.640 align:start position:0%
through this bill I'm a little confused
 
03:31:45.349 --> 03:31:45.359 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that wouldn't that be just
 
03:31:46.710 --> 03:31:46.720 align:start position:0%
putting the same amount of money into a
 
03:31:49.830 --> 03:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
different bucket to disperse
 
03:31:52.269 --> 03:31:52.279 align:start position:0%
no well what it's going to defund the
 
03:31:55.469 --> 03:31:55.479 align:start position:0%
Charities takes the charity out of them
 
03:31:56.469 --> 03:31:56.479 align:start position:0%
well the
 
03:31:58.670 --> 03:31:58.680 align:start position:0%
Charities could ask for the money out of
 
03:32:00.510 --> 03:32:00.520 align:start position:0%
Finance couldn't
 
03:32:04.590 --> 03:32:04.600 align:start position:0%
they well there's already a mechanism
 
03:32:07.670 --> 03:32:07.680 align:start position:0%
state law already has a mechanism and so
 
03:32:09.510 --> 03:32:09.520 align:start position:0%
we would have to that that would bring
 
03:32:12.590 --> 03:32:12.600 align:start position:0%
in a whole new situation that I don't
 
03:32:15.429 --> 03:32:15.439 align:start position:0%
need to answer that yeah okay thank you
 
03:32:20.469 --> 03:32:20.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:20.479 --> 03:32:26.349 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:32:26.349 --> 03:32:26.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:38.309 --> 03:32:38.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:42.630 --> 03:32:42.640 align:start position:0%
Reen good afternoon uh chair and uh
 
03:32:43.950 --> 03:32:43.960 align:start position:0%
members of the committee thank you for
 
03:32:45.630 --> 03:32:45.640 align:start position:0%
hearing from me uh my name is Kathleen
 
03:32:47.950 --> 03:32:47.960 align:start position:0%
re Reen I'm the CEO of the New Hampshire
 
03:32:50.750 --> 03:32:50.760 align:start position:0%
Center for nonprofits we are a Statewide
 
03:32:53.590 --> 03:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
nonprofit Association that uh
 
03:32:55.349 --> 03:32:55.359 align:start position:0%
strengthens and gives voice to New
 
03:32:56.990 --> 03:32:57.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's nonprofits through
 
03:32:59.309 --> 03:32:59.319 align:start position:0%
Leadership Learning opportunities and
 
03:33:01.429 --> 03:33:01.439 align:start position:0%
collaboration we have more than 800
 
03:33:04.110 --> 03:33:04.120 align:start position:0%
members uh currently and I'm not going
 
03:33:05.830 --> 03:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
to repeat a lot of what has been said
 
03:33:08.429 --> 03:33:08.439 align:start position:0%
earlier today about how incredibly
 
03:33:10.349 --> 03:33:10.359 align:start position:0%
important this Revenue stream is for
 
03:33:12.910 --> 03:33:12.920 align:start position:0%
nonprofits I will uh reiterate a couple
 
03:33:14.590 --> 03:33:14.600 align:start position:0%
of points and that is here in New
 
03:33:17.910 --> 03:33:17.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we rely on nonprofits for many
 
03:33:19.710 --> 03:33:19.720 align:start position:0%
services that in other states are
 
03:33:22.110 --> 03:33:22.120 align:start position:0%
performed by government so the fact that
 
03:33:24.349 --> 03:33:24.359 align:start position:0%
the legislature decided as has been
 
03:33:27.150 --> 03:33:27.160 align:start position:0%
noted to make charitable gaming was a
 
03:33:29.229 --> 03:33:29.239 align:start position:0%
very important policy decision and we
 
03:33:31.189 --> 03:33:31.199 align:start position:0%
would urge you to stay the course with
 
03:33:34.670 --> 03:33:34.680 align:start position:0%
that um I will just leave it at that and
 
03:33:37.110 --> 03:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
entertain any questions thank
 
03:33:43.790 --> 03:33:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:49.670 --> 03:33:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:52.349 --> 03:33:52.359 align:start position:0%
Jr okay thank
 
03:34:01.750 --> 03:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:04.030 --> 03:34:04.040 align:start position:0%
Harrington hi thank you for another
 
03:34:07.750 --> 03:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity to reinforce our um goals
 
03:34:11.110 --> 03:34:11.120 align:start position:0%
here um in in hearing what many people
 
03:34:14.429 --> 03:34:14.439 align:start position:0%
said um I'm I guess very Maybe
 
03:34:18.030 --> 03:34:18.040 align:start position:0%
simplistically for our organization we
 
03:34:20.910 --> 03:34:20.920 align:start position:0%
look at this as a very straightforward
 
03:34:24.429 --> 03:34:24.439 align:start position:0%
way to be um quick to to be able to
 
03:34:26.030 --> 03:34:26.040 align:start position:0%
react as opposed to going through
 
03:34:28.910 --> 03:34:28.920 align:start position:0%
another level of you know um I don't
 
03:34:31.189 --> 03:34:31.199 align:start position:0%
want to say bureaucracy but when you're
 
03:34:33.030 --> 03:34:33.040 align:start position:0%
applying for Grants and when you're
 
03:34:36.309 --> 03:34:36.319 align:start position:0%
doing other means to find funding it
 
03:34:39.189 --> 03:34:39.199 align:start position:0%
makes it um really um difficult
 
03:34:40.469 --> 03:34:40.479 align:start position:0%
especially when many of these
 
03:34:43.429 --> 03:34:43.439 align:start position:0%
organizations are run by volunteers who
 
03:34:45.830 --> 03:34:45.840 align:start position:0%
have other full-time jobs um being being
 
03:34:48.910 --> 03:34:48.920 align:start position:0%
able to access these funds in a very
 
03:34:52.630 --> 03:34:52.640 align:start position:0%
straightforward way is super helpful um
 
03:34:53.830 --> 03:34:53.840 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm going to look at it as sort
 
03:34:57.030 --> 03:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
of a farm totable um concept as opposed
 
03:34:58.590 --> 03:34:58.600 align:start position:0%
but you flip it around it's table to
 
03:35:04.750 --> 03:35:04.760 align:start position:0%
farm um so um my point is um this is
 
03:35:07.349 --> 03:35:07.359 align:start position:0%
just uh something that is very helpful
 
03:35:10.150 --> 03:35:10.160 align:start position:0%
to be able to you know get it get a kid
 
03:35:12.750 --> 03:35:12.760 align:start position:0%
a winter jacket at school within a
 
03:35:14.630 --> 03:35:14.640 align:start position:0%
couple of days as opposed to trying to
 
03:35:17.349 --> 03:35:17.359 align:start position:0%
run around in source the money we're
 
03:35:20.030 --> 03:35:20.040 align:start position:0%
this allows us to act very quickly and
 
03:35:22.790 --> 03:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
have funds on
 
03:35:27.070 --> 03:35:27.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:30.269 --> 03:35:30.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:30.279 --> 03:35:41.830 align:start position:0%
 
happened

03:35:41.830 --> 03:35:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:48.990 --> 03:35:49.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:53.429 --> 03:35:53.439 align:start position:0%
okay uh Amy Harrington did I oh she just
 
03:35:53.439 --> 03:35:54.870 align:start position:0%
okay uh Amy Harrington did I oh she just
spoke

03:35:54.870 --> 03:35:54.880 align:start position:0%
spoke
 
03:35:59.469 --> 03:35:59.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:02.389 --> 03:36:02.399 align:start position:0%
didn't that's why I got confused okay
 
03:36:02.399 --> 03:36:13.189 align:start position:0%
didn't that's why I got confused okay
Erica

03:36:13.189 --> 03:36:13.199 align:start position:0%

I already was up here before I am up

here again on in opposition of House
 
03:36:27.870 --> 03:36:27.880 align:start position:0%
Bill 588 I do want to share what
 
03:36:31.070 --> 03:36:31.080 align:start position:0%
charitable um gaming provides for our
 
03:36:32.590 --> 03:36:32.600 align:start position:0%
members and one of those things is
 
03:36:36.590 --> 03:36:36.600 align:start position:0%
ampute soccer what that is it gives a
 
03:36:38.710 --> 03:36:38.720 align:start position:0%
community of people the ability to play
 
03:36:41.349 --> 03:36:41.359 align:start position:0%
a game that they love we had a young man
 
03:36:44.510 --> 03:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
loved soccer was a player he lost his
 
03:36:47.229 --> 03:36:47.239 align:start position:0%
leg he was devastated obviously from the
 
03:36:49.189 --> 03:36:49.199 align:start position:0%
trauma of losing your leg but from the
 
03:36:51.349 --> 03:36:51.359 align:start position:0%
trauma of losing something that's a part
 
03:36:52.950 --> 03:36:52.960 align:start position:0%
of you and that's the game of soccer for
 
03:36:55.349 --> 03:36:55.359 align:start position:0%
a lot of these people he came to one of
 
03:36:57.510 --> 03:36:57.520 align:start position:0%
our ampute training events and he
 
03:36:59.630 --> 03:36:59.640 align:start position:0%
immediately found his Joy again and
 
03:37:01.309 --> 03:37:01.319 align:start position:0%
that's something that these gaming
 
03:37:03.910 --> 03:37:03.920 align:start position:0%
charitable gamings allows nonprofits to
 
03:37:09.550 --> 03:37:09.560 align:start position:0%
do and I urge you not to pass it thank
 
03:37:12.990 --> 03:37:13.000 align:start position:0%
you questions thank
 
03:37:22.590 --> 03:37:22.600 align:start position:0%

Wellington I live and work in conquered
 
03:37:39.590 --> 03:37:39.600 align:start position:0%
and I won't bring up any of the other um
 
03:37:41.830 --> 03:37:41.840 align:start position:0%
wonderful points that um my fellow
 
03:37:44.229 --> 03:37:44.239 align:start position:0%
nonprofit employees have brought up but
 
03:37:46.750 --> 03:37:46.760 align:start position:0%
I did want to um talk a little bit about
 
03:37:49.189 --> 03:37:49.199 align:start position:0%
how we I think are both trying to do the
 
03:37:51.670 --> 03:37:51.680 align:start position:0%
same thing we all have obligations when
 
03:37:54.110 --> 03:37:54.120 align:start position:0%
it comes to funding right so I have an
 
03:37:56.510 --> 03:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
obligation um to make sure that I'm
 
03:37:58.670 --> 03:37:58.680 align:start position:0%
providing Services uh to the community
 
03:38:00.550 --> 03:38:00.560 align:start position:0%
to our most vulnerable members as well
 
03:38:03.429 --> 03:38:03.439 align:start position:0%
as to my staff you have an obligation to
 
03:38:05.349 --> 03:38:05.359 align:start position:0%
meet the various needs of your
 
03:38:08.349 --> 03:38:08.359 align:start position:0%
constituents and the state um and one of
 
03:38:09.990 --> 03:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
the points that I wanted to bring up was
 
03:38:10.000 --> 03:38:11.229 align:start position:0%
the points that I wanted to bring up was
that

03:38:11.229 --> 03:38:11.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:38:14.630 --> 03:38:14.640 align:start position:0%
14% of the state's Workforce is employed
 
03:38:16.349 --> 03:38:16.359 align:start position:0%
by a nonprofit
 
03:38:18.630 --> 03:38:18.640 align:start position:0%
and my concern here is that if you start
 
03:38:22.349 --> 03:38:22.359 align:start position:0%
to pick one thread of a very very
 
03:38:25.389 --> 03:38:25.399 align:start position:0%
tenuous funding situation you could pull
 
03:38:27.309 --> 03:38:27.319 align:start position:0%
and unravel an entire sweater without
 
03:38:36.189 --> 03:38:36.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:39.750 --> 03:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
you Amy holling grath
 
03:38:50.710 --> 03:38:50.720 align:start position:0%

um basically um trying not to repeat
 
03:39:07.790 --> 03:39:07.800 align:start position:0%
things that you've heard before but
 
03:39:10.790 --> 03:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
trying to continue to relay the impact
 
03:39:12.830 --> 03:39:12.840 align:start position:0%
that um the charitable gaming and the
 
03:39:16.429 --> 03:39:16.439 align:start position:0%
HHS um art does for us um um so
 
03:39:18.670 --> 03:39:18.680 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming has been a life a
 
03:39:20.710 --> 03:39:20.720 align:start position:0%
vital lifeblood as you know for a lot of
 
03:39:24.150 --> 03:39:24.160 align:start position:0%
nonprofits across us so just want to
 
03:39:28.670 --> 03:39:28.680 align:start position:0%
again um remind at a time when you know
 
03:39:31.910 --> 03:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
it uh the economy is already strain
 
03:39:34.229 --> 03:39:34.239 align:start position:0%
leading to unfortunate downfall of many
 
03:39:36.790 --> 03:39:36.800 align:start position:0%
nonprofits already um putting the
 
03:39:38.469 --> 03:39:38.479 align:start position:0%
interest of the Lottery Commission above
 
03:39:41.870 --> 03:39:41.880 align:start position:0%
the welfare of of these nonprofits um is
 
03:39:44.510 --> 03:39:44.520 align:start position:0%
is something that we are against so
 
03:39:47.550 --> 03:39:47.560 align:start position:0%
again respectfully asking you to um
 
03:39:50.870 --> 03:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
reject the HB
 
03:39:56.030 --> 03:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:07.550 --> 03:40:07.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:10.189 --> 03:40:10.199 align:start position:0%
Ali can you hear me now good afternoon
 
03:40:12.150 --> 03:40:12.160 align:start position:0%

03:40:14.349 --> 03:40:14.359 align:start position:0%
CEO of Webster house Children's Home
 
03:40:17.990 --> 03:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
which has been around for 141 years I'm
 
03:40:19.790 --> 03:40:19.800 align:start position:0%
so very proud to be a part of that
 
03:40:22.070 --> 03:40:22.080 align:start position:0%
mission and I am testifying in
 
03:40:23.990 --> 03:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
opposition of HB
 
03:40:26.950 --> 03:40:26.960 align:start position:0%
588 again I just want to reiterate that
 
03:40:28.790 --> 03:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
um based on our contract with the state
 
03:40:31.630 --> 03:40:31.640 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire we receive a daily rate
 
03:40:34.229 --> 03:40:34.239 align:start position:0%
um from the state which covers only half
 
03:40:37.389 --> 03:40:37.399 align:start position:0%
of our expenses 50% of our expenses it
 
03:40:40.429 --> 03:40:40.439 align:start position:0%
is my sole job and responsibility to to
 
03:40:42.750 --> 03:40:42.760 align:start position:0%
meet that Gap to close that Gap and I'm
 
03:40:45.790 --> 03:40:45.800 align:start position:0%
so eternally grateful for the funding
 
03:40:47.870 --> 03:40:47.880 align:start position:0%
that we have received from charitable
 
03:40:51.070 --> 03:40:51.080 align:start position:0%
gaming it will negatively impact our
 
03:40:53.950 --> 03:40:53.960 align:start position:0%
operation if we do not have that funding
 
03:40:57.950 --> 03:40:57.960 align:start position:0%
I strongly urge you to reject HB 588
 
03:41:05.630 --> 03:41:05.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:13.910 --> 03:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:16.830 --> 03:41:16.840 align:start position:0%
tant thank you Mr chairman and you did
 
03:41:18.349 --> 03:41:18.359 align:start position:0%
an even better job with the
 
03:41:20.910 --> 03:41:20.920 align:start position:0%
pronunciation that time
 
03:41:20.920 --> 03:41:23.030 align:start position:0%
pronunciation that time
around

03:41:23.030 --> 03:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
around
 
03:41:26.469 --> 03:41:26.479 align:start position:0%
bour I uh the in marketing they say you
 
03:41:28.990 --> 03:41:29.000 align:start position:0%
need to hear a message seven time for it
 
03:41:31.590 --> 03:41:31.600 align:start position:0%
to sink in so hopefully I've said
 
03:41:33.870 --> 03:41:33.880 align:start position:0%
bonjour a few times and you'll say it to
 
03:41:36.070 --> 03:41:36.080 align:start position:0%
me the next time you see me on the
 
03:41:40.630 --> 03:41:40.640 align:start position:0%
street uh but uh with regard to this uh
 
03:41:45.070 --> 03:41:45.080 align:start position:0%
legislation certainly um uh I'm I'm with
 
03:41:47.030 --> 03:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
the the Franco American Center we're
 
03:41:51.990 --> 03:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
against it um back in uh earlier this
 
03:41:54.189 --> 03:41:54.199 align:start position:0%
afternoon I was looking through my
 
03:41:57.429 --> 03:41:57.439 align:start position:0%
MySpace profile and I
 
03:42:02.030 --> 03:42:02.040 align:start position:0%
realized that that's what I had back in
 
03:42:06.790 --> 03:42:06.800 align:start position:0%
2006 and um you know now I've actually
 
03:42:10.630 --> 03:42:10.640 align:start position:0%
evolved to Facebook maybe never to go to
 
03:42:15.349 --> 03:42:15.359 align:start position:0%
Instagram or Tik Tok for sure but um but
 
03:42:17.790 --> 03:42:17.800 align:start position:0%
I think that this charitable gaming has
 
03:42:20.710 --> 03:42:20.720 align:start position:0%
certainly evolved over time in the uh
 
03:42:24.030 --> 03:42:24.040 align:start position:0%
inclusion of historical horse racing has
 
03:42:27.630 --> 03:42:27.640 align:start position:0%
helped to make more money available to
 
03:42:31.510 --> 03:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
more nonprofits to do more good in our
 
03:42:35.149 --> 03:42:35.159 align:start position:0%
communities and um so I hope that you'll
 
03:42:39.710 --> 03:42:39.720 align:start position:0%
uh certainly uh vote against this
 
03:42:44.469 --> 03:42:44.479 align:start position:0%
legislation and uh the uh moving of uh
 
03:42:48.269 --> 03:42:48.279 align:start position:0%
historic racing into uh the education
 
03:42:54.830 --> 03:42:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:04.309 --> 03:43:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:06.870 --> 03:43:06.880 align:start position:0%
appleberg so good afternoon hello again
 
03:43:08.710 --> 03:43:08.720 align:start position:0%
I'm starting to enjoy going after my
 
03:43:12.110 --> 03:43:12.120 align:start position:0%
friend John the crazy Frenchman um I'll
 
03:43:13.990 --> 03:43:14.000 align:start position:0%

03:43:14.000 --> 03:43:16.149 align:start position:0%
send you an email from my AOL account
shortly

03:43:16.149 --> 03:43:16.159 align:start position:0%
shortly
 
03:43:19.429 --> 03:43:19.439 align:start position:0%
I um am the President of the United Way
 
03:43:22.550 --> 03:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
of Greater NASA of course we are here
 
03:43:25.950 --> 03:43:25.960 align:start position:0%
encouraging you to vote HB 588 in
 
03:43:29.590 --> 03:43:29.600 align:start position:0%
expedient legislate we look at this as
 
03:43:31.830 --> 03:43:31.840 align:start position:0%
I'd like to say
 
03:43:35.469 --> 03:43:35.479 align:start position:0%
we what what we really see going on here
 
03:43:38.309 --> 03:43:38.319 align:start position:0%
is this is in fact a tax on the
 
03:43:41.229 --> 03:43:41.239 align:start position:0%
nonprofit sector nothing nothing short
 
03:43:44.110 --> 03:43:44.120 align:start position:0%
of that it's a 122.5 million tax on the
 
03:43:46.429 --> 03:43:46.439 align:start position:0%
nonprofit sector
 
03:43:49.110 --> 03:43:49.120 align:start position:0%
now it's hard for me I mean how would
 
03:43:50.710 --> 03:43:50.720 align:start position:0%
the United Way guys say don't fund
 
03:43:52.590 --> 03:43:52.600 align:start position:0%
education of course we think it's
 
03:43:54.790 --> 03:43:54.800 align:start position:0%
important to fund education we just
 
03:43:56.389 --> 03:43:56.399 align:start position:0%
don't think it should be done on the
 
03:43:58.469 --> 03:43:58.479 align:start position:0%
back of the sector which is also trying
 
03:44:00.710 --> 03:44:00.720 align:start position:0%
to support
 
03:44:03.389 --> 03:44:03.399 align:start position:0%
education when historic horse racing
 
03:44:03.399 --> 03:44:04.189 align:start position:0%
education when historic horse racing
went

03:44:04.189 --> 03:44:04.199 align:start position:0%
went
 
03:44:08.189 --> 03:44:08.199 align:start position:0%
into into um place and I spent several
 
03:44:10.750 --> 03:44:10.760 align:start position:0%
years thank you to representative abami
 
03:44:12.950 --> 03:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
taking us down memory lane talking to
 
03:44:14.710 --> 03:44:14.720 align:start position:0%
this committee about that there was an
 
03:44:17.349 --> 03:44:17.359 align:start position:0%
extreme push there was a push to double
 
03:44:19.469 --> 03:44:19.479 align:start position:0%
the number of Charities that there are
 
03:44:21.630 --> 03:44:21.640 align:start position:0%
in the state and there's also been a
 
03:44:25.269 --> 03:44:25.279 align:start position:0%
push which wasn't mentioned to um
 
03:44:27.790 --> 03:44:27.800 align:start position:0%
strongly encourage the gaming operators
 
03:44:29.389 --> 03:44:29.399 align:start position:0%
to reduce the number of days they give
 
03:44:33.389 --> 03:44:33.399 align:start position:0%
to seven even though 10 is what is um
 
03:44:36.389 --> 03:44:36.399 align:start position:0%
Allowed by Statute
 
03:44:40.229 --> 03:44:40.239 align:start position:0%
so when representative fellows thinks
 
03:44:43.910 --> 03:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
that there will be this increasing trend
 
03:44:45.870 --> 03:44:45.880 align:start position:0%
of Revenue what that doesn't take into
 
03:44:47.790 --> 03:44:47.800 align:start position:0%
account is if you pull away historic
 
03:44:51.309 --> 03:44:51.319 align:start position:0%
horse racing you're also still having in
 
03:44:53.110 --> 03:44:53.120 align:start position:0%
place double the number of Charities
 
03:44:55.309 --> 03:44:55.319 align:start position:0%
with less days on the on their on their
 
03:44:58.229 --> 03:44:58.239 align:start position:0%
plate this will in fact absolutely take
 
03:45:00.189 --> 03:45:00.199 align:start position:0%
away money from from the charities in
 
03:45:02.550 --> 03:45:02.560 align:start position:0%
the state um I really don't have any
 
03:45:05.070 --> 03:45:05.080 align:start position:0%
other points to make than that but I do
 
03:45:07.269 --> 03:45:07.279 align:start position:0%
appreciate you listening and uh would
 
03:45:09.590 --> 03:45:09.600 align:start position:0%

03:45:44.269 --> 03:45:44.279 align:start position:0%
know I'm in a I'm in a tough spot cuz
 
03:45:45.710 --> 03:45:45.720 align:start position:0%
I'm extending our Day by a little bit of
 
03:45:47.309 --> 03:45:47.319 align:start position:0%
time but there was precedent someone
 
03:45:49.389 --> 03:45:49.399 align:start position:0%
other folks have talked about both bills
 
03:45:52.510 --> 03:45:52.520 align:start position:0%
together so as an observer from the back
 
03:45:54.389 --> 03:45:54.399 align:start position:0%
I think um if you've ever heard the
 
03:45:56.309 --> 03:45:56.319 align:start position:0%
analogy I don't have any swimmers or
 
03:45:59.710 --> 03:45:59.720 align:start position:0%
divers in the room no sport folk okay so
 
03:46:00.950 --> 03:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
the only thing that's similar about
 
03:46:02.309 --> 03:46:02.319 align:start position:0%
swimming and Diving is the fact that
 
03:46:04.389 --> 03:46:04.399 align:start position:0%
there's a pool and there's water I think
 
03:46:06.110 --> 03:46:06.120 align:start position:0%
what it's been interesting to me today
 
03:46:07.670 --> 03:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
as I listen to these bills and I listen
 
03:46:09.550 --> 03:46:09.560 align:start position:0%
to the discussion and the vibrant
 
03:46:12.189 --> 03:46:12.199 align:start position:0%
discussion from my peers is the only
 
03:46:13.670 --> 03:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
thing that is the thread between these
 
03:46:15.189 --> 03:46:15.199 align:start position:0%
two bills that brought all of us us here
 
03:46:17.389 --> 03:46:17.399 align:start position:0%
to talk to you today is in fact the
 
03:46:20.269 --> 03:46:20.279 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming portion and all of our
 
03:46:24.149 --> 03:46:24.159 align:start position:0%
nonprofits so the first bill aimed to
 
03:46:26.389 --> 03:46:26.399 align:start position:0%
say that some Charities were making too
 
03:46:29.790 --> 03:46:29.800 align:start position:0%
much money or unfairly more than other
 
03:46:32.389 --> 03:46:32.399 align:start position:0%
Charities and so the resolution to that
 
03:46:33.990 --> 03:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
for that bill that was proposed was
 
03:46:35.870 --> 03:46:35.880 align:start position:0%
instead to just Cap all of us at the
 
03:46:37.189 --> 03:46:37.199 align:start position:0%
same dollar
 
03:46:40.030 --> 03:46:40.040 align:start position:0%
amount without scaffolding people that
 
03:46:43.389 --> 03:46:43.399 align:start position:0%
were making less or taking those funds
 
03:46:44.910 --> 03:46:44.920 align:start position:0%
and letting them go to other people
 
03:46:47.389 --> 03:46:47.399 align:start position:0%
people who as you say are unable to
 
03:46:50.189 --> 03:46:50.199 align:start position:0%
break into charitable gaming themselves
 
03:46:52.110 --> 03:46:52.120 align:start position:0%
with this bill the same thing I'm
 
03:46:54.710 --> 03:46:54.720 align:start position:0%
hearing is that again a subset of folks
 
03:46:56.790 --> 03:46:56.800 align:start position:0%
that are getting an opportunity to make
 
03:46:59.389 --> 03:46:59.399 align:start position:0%
some of this income are going to just be
 
03:47:01.389 --> 03:47:01.399 align:start position:0%
completely cut out because theirs
 
03:47:03.110 --> 03:47:03.120 align:start position:0%
happens to be given to them through
 
03:47:05.710 --> 03:47:05.720 align:start position:0%
historic horse racing and instead it
 
03:47:08.189 --> 03:47:08.199 align:start position:0%
won't be given to any other Charities
 
03:47:11.110 --> 03:47:11.120 align:start position:0%
who are doing this ground Stakes effort
 
03:47:14.070 --> 03:47:14.080 align:start position:0%
work for the citizens of New Hampshire
 
03:47:15.670 --> 03:47:15.680 align:start position:0%
and they're again giving it
 
03:47:18.990 --> 03:47:19.000 align:start position:0%
to I'm so sorry for my ignorance the the
 
03:47:19.000 --> 03:47:20.349 align:start position:0%
to I'm so sorry for my ignorance the the
Lottery

03:47:20.349 --> 03:47:20.359 align:start position:0%
Lottery
 
03:47:22.790 --> 03:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
Commission I did try to research things
 
03:47:24.910 --> 03:47:24.920 align:start position:0%
before coming today I don't know how
 
03:47:27.269 --> 03:47:27.279 align:start position:0%
quickly government works but my personal
 
03:47:29.149 --> 03:47:29.159 align:start position:0%
preparation for today was very
 
03:47:31.590 --> 03:47:31.600 align:start position:0%
short and I know I'm showing my
 
03:47:34.590 --> 03:47:34.600 align:start position:0%
ignorance I appreciate you I just want
 
03:47:36.590 --> 03:47:36.600 align:start position:0%
to say that I had a lot of trouble
 
03:47:38.910 --> 03:47:38.920 align:start position:0%
figuring out the fund that the Lottery
 
03:47:40.950 --> 03:47:40.960 align:start position:0%
Commission all of its work like what
 
03:47:43.630 --> 03:47:43.640 align:start position:0%
does it function to do I saw things like
 
03:47:46.030 --> 03:47:46.040 align:start position:0%
fees and I I don't know I it really
 
03:47:48.030 --> 03:47:48.040 align:start position:0%
looked as though that fund might do a
 
03:47:50.070 --> 03:47:50.080 align:start position:0%
lot of different things and so I can't
 
03:47:51.670 --> 03:47:51.680 align:start position:0%
confidently say that I knew it was
 
03:47:53.910 --> 03:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
directly going to go to education like
 
03:47:58.349 --> 03:47:58.359 align:start position:0%
some of my other people have said I
 
03:48:00.990 --> 03:48:01.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity I would love
 
03:48:03.070 --> 03:48:03.080 align:start position:0%
to engage in more dialogue I think this
 
03:48:05.429 --> 03:48:05.439 align:start position:0%
is very important work and I appreciate
 
03:48:06.950 --> 03:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
everyone's time here
 
03:48:08.990 --> 03:48:09.000 align:start position:0%
today thank you very
 
03:48:22.429 --> 03:48:22.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:22.439 --> 03:48:27.070 align:start position:0%
 
oh

03:48:27.070 --> 03:48:27.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:29.429 --> 03:48:29.439 align:start position:0%
know so thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
03:48:32.309 --> 03:48:32.319 align:start position:0%
you Comm as well so a quick point I
 
03:48:34.910 --> 03:48:34.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to make and I do apologize if
 
03:48:36.710 --> 03:48:36.720 align:start position:0%
this has already been discussed I'm
 
03:48:38.550 --> 03:48:38.560 align:start position:0%
sorry what was your name I'm sorry uh
 
03:48:41.790 --> 03:48:41.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:45.030 --> 03:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
do thank you okay sorry about that uh so
 
03:48:46.469 --> 03:48:46.479 align:start position:0%
very quickly something I hadn't
 
03:48:49.950 --> 03:48:49.960 align:start position:0%
discussed before so having this funds if
 
03:48:53.269 --> 03:48:53.279 align:start position:0%
the bill passes go to a large amount of
 
03:48:56.349 --> 03:48:56.359 align:start position:0%
money go to the Lottery Commission what
 
03:48:58.229 --> 03:48:58.239 align:start position:0%
is the cost that the Lottery Commission
 
03:49:02.110 --> 03:49:02.120 align:start position:0%
is going to incur to handle that money
 
03:49:04.990 --> 03:49:05.000 align:start position:0%
and so with charitable contributions
 
03:49:08.189 --> 03:49:08.199 align:start position:0%
with nonprofits money is very important
 
03:49:10.670 --> 03:49:10.680 align:start position:0%
currently the allocation of that money I
 
03:49:13.510 --> 03:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
think I heard $15 million a year roughly
 
03:49:16.950 --> 03:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
that's being handled by by the gaming
 
03:49:18.910 --> 03:49:18.920 align:start position:0%
companies themselves as well as
 
03:49:21.750 --> 03:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
nonprofits trying to get the money to go
 
03:49:24.429 --> 03:49:24.439 align:start position:0%
to them so if the money goes to the
 
03:49:26.309 --> 03:49:26.319 align:start position:0%
Lottery Commission does the Lottery
 
03:49:28.590 --> 03:49:28.600 align:start position:0%
Commission have in its budget additional
 
03:49:31.990 --> 03:49:32.000 align:start position:0%

the hours for Keno gaming on

duet any
 
03:57:45.710 --> 03:57:45.720 align:start position:0%
discussion yeah represent
 
03:57:49.469 --> 03:57:49.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:52.750 --> 03:57:52.760 align:start position:0%
chairman uh this itl of complete
 
03:57:55.590 --> 03:57:55.600 align:start position:0%
corporate reporting that is being uh
 
03:57:59.149 --> 03:57:59.159 align:start position:0%
proposed for House Bill 502 is saying
 
03:58:01.870 --> 03:58:01.880 align:start position:0%
that we here in the
 
03:58:04.910 --> 03:58:04.920 align:start position:0%
state have one party that supports this
 
03:58:08.189 --> 03:58:08.199 align:start position:0%
two-tier rule of law in regards to tax
 
03:58:11.070 --> 03:58:11.080 align:start position:0%
liability one for New Hampshire domestic
 
03:58:13.870 --> 03:58:13.880 align:start position:0%
companies versus foreign multinational
 
03:58:16.110 --> 03:58:16.120 align:start position:0%
compan companies the New Hampshire
 
03:58:19.070 --> 03:58:19.080 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court said in 1986 in a written
 
03:58:21.030 --> 03:58:21.040 align:start position:0%
opinion The Waters Edge method was
 
03:58:23.510 --> 03:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
adopted for the benefit of foreign
 
03:58:25.790 --> 03:58:25.800 align:start position:0%
businesses the nature of Waters Edge
 
03:58:27.309 --> 03:58:27.319 align:start position:0%
formula requires that foreign
 
03:58:29.990 --> 03:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
subsidiaries be treated differently than
 
03:58:31.990 --> 03:58:32.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire domestic
 
03:58:34.070 --> 03:58:34.080 align:start position:0%
subsidiaries the difference is that the
 
03:58:36.510 --> 03:58:36.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire domestic subsidiaries
 
03:58:39.309 --> 03:58:39.319 align:start position:0%
income is subject to taxation while
 
03:58:41.349 --> 03:58:41.359 align:start position:0%
foreign multinational subsidiaries
 
03:58:46.670 --> 03:58:46.680 align:start position:0%
income is not in New Hampshire the New
 
03:58:48.510 --> 03:58:48.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court The Waters Edge
 
03:58:51.269 --> 03:58:51.279 align:start position:0%
method eliminates overseas business
 
03:58:53.790 --> 03:58:53.800 align:start position:0%
organizations from subjection to the New
 
03:58:56.149 --> 03:58:56.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire business profits tax this is
 
03:59:00.309 --> 03:59:00.319 align:start position:0%
not a new tax this is not a new tax rate
 
03:59:02.750 --> 03:59:02.760 align:start position:0%
the reported tax liability Revenue when
 
03:59:05.469 --> 03:59:05.479 align:start position:0%
included in the BPT paid to the state of
 
03:59:08.269 --> 03:59:08.279 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Dr like our New Hampshire
 
03:59:10.950 --> 03:59:10.960 align:start position:0%
domestic companies presently do would
 
03:59:13.389 --> 03:59:13.399 align:start position:0%
put additional Revenue in the education
 
03:59:14.550 --> 03:59:14.560 align:start position:0%
trust fund
 
03:59:17.309 --> 03:59:17.319 align:start position:0%
providing property tax relief by
 
03:59:20.710 --> 03:59:20.720 align:start position:0%
increasing public education funding this
 
03:59:23.870 --> 03:59:23.880 align:start position:0%
bill says in conclusion just pay the
 
03:59:27.149 --> 03:59:27.159 align:start position:0%
full tax liability like our domestic New
 
03:59:29.710 --> 03:59:29.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Community businesses are doing
 
03:59:32.990 --> 03:59:33.000 align:start position:0%
equal under the law not two
 
03:59:35.269 --> 03:59:35.279 align:start position:0%
tears thank you Mr
 
03:59:38.389 --> 03:59:38.399 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you any other discussion
 
03:59:41.070 --> 03:59:41.080 align:start position:0%
yes represent
 
03:59:43.790 --> 03:59:43.800 align:start position:0%
Opel I think fundamentally the issue is
 
03:59:45.670 --> 03:59:45.680 align:start position:0%
one of
 
03:59:49.269 --> 03:59:49.279 align:start position:0%
trust democracy and the rule of law
 
03:59:51.630 --> 03:59:51.640 align:start position:0%
function on the fundamental principle
 
03:59:53.189 --> 03:59:53.199 align:start position:0%
that we
 
03:59:58.070 --> 03:59:58.080 align:start position:0%
trust that we'll all be treated the same
 
04:00:00.990 --> 04:00:01.000 align:start position:0%
and yet those people who run the
 
04:00:02.710 --> 04:00:02.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire businesses are not treated the
 
04:00:04.269 --> 04:00:04.279 align:start position:0%
same as foreign
 
04:00:05.990 --> 04:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
multinationals as representative
 
04:00:08.229 --> 04:00:08.239 align:start position:0%
shamberg said we have a the Hampshire
 
04:00:11.750 --> 04:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court decision that explicitly
 
04:00:15.070 --> 04:00:15.080 align:start position:0%
makes that point
 
04:00:18.630 --> 04:00:18.640 align:start position:0%
um one other quick thing uh there have
 
04:00:20.269 --> 04:00:20.279 align:start position:0%
been some representations about the
 
04:00:23.990 --> 04:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
commission report I would hope
 
04:00:27.990 --> 04:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
again that before you vote on the
 
04:00:29.950 --> 04:00:29.960 align:start position:0%
floor that you would take the
 
04:00:33.710 --> 04:00:33.720 align:start position:0%
opportunity to read both the majority
 
04:00:35.910 --> 04:00:35.920 align:start position:0%
and the minority
 
04:00:38.389 --> 04:00:38.399 align:start position:0%
reports um I think it's important to
 
04:00:38.399 --> 04:00:39.389 align:start position:0%
reports um I think it's important to
read

04:00:39.389 --> 04:00:39.399 align:start position:0%
read
 
04:00:41.550 --> 04:00:41.560 align:start position:0%
both one of the things you will notice
 
04:00:44.189 --> 04:00:44.199 align:start position:0%
in the majority report is all although
 
04:00:47.349 --> 04:00:47.359 align:start position:0%
it was represented as this 7 to1
 
04:00:50.710 --> 04:00:50.720 align:start position:0%
vote in fact it was
 
04:00:53.630 --> 04:00:53.640 align:start position:0%
not uh the representative from Bia very
 
04:00:55.469 --> 04:00:55.479 align:start position:0%
explicitly said they weren't taking a
 
04:00:58.630 --> 04:00:58.640 align:start position:0%
position the representative from the CPA
 
04:01:00.950 --> 04:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
Society said very explicitly they were
 
04:01:02.990 --> 04:01:03.000 align:start position:0%
not taking a
 
04:01:05.030 --> 04:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
position the representative from the
 
04:01:06.710 --> 04:01:06.720 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue Administration
 
04:01:08.550 --> 04:01:08.560 align:start position:0%
said very explicitly they were not
 
04:01:10.550 --> 04:01:10.560 align:start position:0%
taking a
 
04:01:13.469 --> 04:01:13.479 align:start position:0%
position the actual only votes to take a
 
04:01:13.479 --> 04:01:14.550 align:start position:0%
position the actual only votes to take a
position

04:01:14.550 --> 04:01:14.560 align:start position:0%
position
 
04:01:16.469 --> 04:01:16.479 align:start position:0%
were the four legislative members
 
04:01:18.229 --> 04:01:18.239 align:start position:0%
including representative shamberg who
 
04:01:21.189 --> 04:01:21.199 align:start position:0%
was the one vote against the majority
 
04:01:23.670 --> 04:01:23.680 align:start position:0%
report um and there were a number of
 
04:01:26.750 --> 04:01:26.760 align:start position:0%
things I think in the majority report
 
04:01:30.189 --> 04:01:30.199 align:start position:0%
that The Minority Report
 
04:01:32.870 --> 04:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
refuted um so I would urge you to read
 
04:01:35.349 --> 04:01:35.359 align:start position:0%
both um but
 
04:01:35.359 --> 04:01:37.469 align:start position:0%
both um but
again

04:01:37.469 --> 04:01:37.479 align:start position:0%
again
 
04:01:40.349 --> 04:01:40.359 align:start position:0%
um there was uh someone that I worked
 
04:01:41.590 --> 04:01:41.600 align:start position:0%
with at the
 
04:01:44.830 --> 04:01:44.840 align:start position:0%
Pentagon a Navy Admiral who
 
04:01:48.269 --> 04:01:48.279 align:start position:0%
said once that you can surge people and
 
04:01:50.030 --> 04:01:50.040 align:start position:0%
you can surge equipment but you can't
 
04:01:50.040 --> 04:01:51.110 align:start position:0%
you can surge equipment but you can't
surge

04:01:51.110 --> 04:01:51.120 align:start position:0%
surge
 
04:01:53.349 --> 04:01:53.359 align:start position:0%
trust and this is fundamentally a
 
04:01:55.030 --> 04:01:55.040 align:start position:0%
question of trust whether the people of
 
04:01:58.950 --> 04:01:58.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire can trust that the tax
 
04:02:02.229 --> 04:02:02.239 align:start position:0%
system is the same for everyone thank
 
04:02:04.229 --> 04:02:04.239 align:start position:0%
you Mr
 
04:02:07.870 --> 04:02:07.880 align:start position:0%
chairman representative JY thank you Mr
 
04:02:09.870 --> 04:02:09.880 align:start position:0%
chair yes please if you have the time
 
04:02:12.910 --> 04:02:12.920 align:start position:0%
and uh are uh unable to go to sleep you
 
04:02:15.710 --> 04:02:15.720 align:start position:0%
can read both of the uh reports um
 
04:02:19.149 --> 04:02:19.159 align:start position:0%
they're relatively uh complete and in
 
04:02:22.309 --> 04:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
detail uh of the commission that
 
04:02:24.469 --> 04:02:24.479 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury chaired I was
 
04:02:27.510 --> 04:02:27.520 align:start position:0%
on that I was one of the seven in favor
 
04:02:30.750 --> 04:02:30.760 align:start position:0%
and yes agencies did not vote because
 
04:02:33.590 --> 04:02:33.600 align:start position:0%
agencies should not vote on legislative
 
04:02:37.830 --> 04:02:37.840 align:start position:0%
uh commission reports and the CPA
 
04:02:40.149 --> 04:02:40.159 align:start position:0%
Association did not vote although their
 
04:02:43.349 --> 04:02:43.359 align:start position:0%
testimony was that uh trying to uh
 
04:02:45.349 --> 04:02:45.359 align:start position:0%
enforce this was going to be rather
 
04:02:48.309 --> 04:02:48.319 align:start position:0%
complex as was indicated by the
 
04:02:52.510 --> 04:02:52.520 align:start position:0%
department of ourd when they spoke here
 
04:02:54.870 --> 04:02:54.880 align:start position:0%
uh the fact of the matter is revenues
 
04:02:57.550 --> 04:02:57.560 align:start position:0%
have increased under their current tax
 
04:03:00.149 --> 04:03:00.159 align:start position:0%
system and they would likely have
 
04:03:05.389 --> 04:03:05.399 align:start position:0%
decreased under the 40y old proposal
 
04:03:09.590 --> 04:03:09.600 align:start position:0%
that is being made by uh the uh other
 
04:03:14.030 --> 04:03:14.040 align:start position:0%
side thank you Mr chair
 
04:03:14.040 --> 04:03:15.830 align:start position:0%
side thank you Mr chair
anybody

04:03:15.830 --> 04:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
04:03:20.110 --> 04:03:20.120 align:start position:0%
else yes elberger thank you Mr chairman
 
04:03:23.950 --> 04:03:23.960 align:start position:0%
my re my recall which I admit sometimes
 
04:03:26.349 --> 04:03:26.359 align:start position:0%
is getting fuzzy lately of
 
04:03:26.359 --> 04:03:27.710 align:start position:0%
is getting fuzzy lately of
Representative

04:03:27.710 --> 04:03:27.720 align:start position:0%
Representative
 
04:03:31.910 --> 04:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
spilsbury's testimony here boil down to
 
04:03:34.550 --> 04:03:34.560 align:start position:0%
opposition because getting something
 
04:03:36.790 --> 04:03:36.800 align:start position:0%
like this implemented was going to be
 
04:03:39.189 --> 04:03:39.199 align:start position:0%
too difficult that was the main
 
04:03:41.269 --> 04:03:41.279 align:start position:0%
opposition and I respect difficulty we
 
04:03:43.790 --> 04:03:43.800 align:start position:0%
all know that we live with difficulties
 
04:03:44.990 --> 04:03:45.000 align:start position:0%
and we're dealing with a difficult
 
04:03:47.710 --> 04:03:47.720 align:start position:0%
budget but to present the only
 
04:03:50.229 --> 04:03:50.239 align:start position:0%
opposition as this would be too hard to
 
04:03:52.550 --> 04:03:52.560 align:start position:0%
implement to me does not seem a
 
04:03:56.309 --> 04:03:56.319 align:start position:0%
sufficient condition to vote against it
 
04:03:56.319 --> 04:04:01.510 align:start position:0%
sufficient condition to vote against it
thank

04:04:01.510 --> 04:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:04.950 --> 04:04:04.960 align:start position:0%

motion sure um this bill basically
 
04:07:05.189 --> 04:07:05.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't increase any funding it just
 
04:07:09.070 --> 04:07:09.080 align:start position:0%
looks to shift money or money's around
 
04:07:10.550 --> 04:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
from one pocket of the government to the
 
04:07:12.469 --> 04:07:12.479 align:start position:0%
other pocket problem is it's going to a
 
04:07:14.349 --> 04:07:14.359 align:start position:0%
pocket that has a hole in it
 
04:07:17.710 --> 04:07:17.720 align:start position:0%
the education system um the inflation
 
04:07:19.070 --> 04:07:19.080 align:start position:0%
rate is
 
04:07:21.990 --> 04:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
uh it doesn't so
 
04:07:24.990 --> 04:07:25.000 align:start position:0%
far the school funding has outpaced
 
04:07:25.000 --> 04:07:27.269 align:start position:0%
far the school funding has outpaced
inflation

04:07:27.269 --> 04:07:27.279 align:start position:0%
inflation
 
04:07:27.279 --> 04:07:28.950 align:start position:0%
inflation
exponentially

04:07:28.950 --> 04:07:28.960 align:start position:0%
exponentially
 
04:07:31.550 --> 04:07:31.560 align:start position:0%
um that issue is going to be addressed
 
04:07:36.309 --> 04:07:36.319 align:start position:0%
hopefully by the new committee on uh Pol
 
04:07:38.429 --> 04:07:38.439 align:start position:0%
funding policy so I don't see any need
 
04:07:41.750 --> 04:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
for this bill okay anybody else
 
04:07:45.950 --> 04:07:45.960 align:start position:0%

04:08:11.510 --> 04:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
approach of present tax revenue it does
 
04:08:15.229 --> 04:08:15.239 align:start position:0%
not increase taxes it just changes the
 
04:08:19.790 --> 04:08:19.800 align:start position:0%
percentage established under title
 
04:08:23.389 --> 04:08:23.399 align:start position:0%
577 e colon

trust fund it would be a
 
04:08:35.000 --> 04:08:36.790 align:start position:0%
trust fund it would be a
43.9%

increase of $68 million estimated and it
 
04:08:42.510 --> 04:08:42.520 align:start position:0%

well the same reasons as before doesn't
 
04:12:14.590 --> 04:12:14.600 align:start position:0%
address Runway
 
04:12:18.109 --> 04:12:18.119 align:start position:0%
costs okay Mr chairman uh representative
 
04:12:22.710 --> 04:12:22.720 align:start position:0%
sham something to say I do have a
 
04:12:25.910 --> 04:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
slightly different
 
04:12:25.920 --> 04:12:27.550 align:start position:0%
slightly different
approach

04:12:27.550 --> 04:12:27.560 align:start position:0%
approach
 
04:12:30.349 --> 04:12:30.359 align:start position:0%
um oops
 
04:12:30.359 --> 04:12:32.229 align:start position:0%
um oops
Yeah

04:12:32.229 --> 04:12:32.239 align:start position:0%
Yeah
 
04:12:35.349 --> 04:12:35.359 align:start position:0%
wrong the intent of this bill uh was to
 
04:12:37.830 --> 04:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
increase the amount of business profits
 
04:12:40.109 --> 04:12:40.119 align:start position:0%
tax that would go into the education
 
04:12:42.109 --> 04:12:42.119 align:start position:0%
trust fund it would be
 
04:12:45.109 --> 04:12:45.119 align:start position:0%
150 $8
 
04:12:45.119 --> 04:12:48.349 align:start position:0%
150 $8
million

04:12:48.349 --> 04:12:48.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:51.469 --> 04:12:51.479 align:start position:0%
um I am as I
 
04:12:54.189 --> 04:12:54.199 align:start position:0%
campaigned uh said we have to think out
 
04:12:57.910 --> 04:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
of the box to resolve this uh issue of
 
04:12:59.990 --> 04:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh public education funding adequate
 
04:13:02.910 --> 04:13:02.920 align:start position:0%
funding and addressing the
 
04:13:07.710 --> 04:13:07.720 align:start position:0%
swep I uh was hoping that this committee
 
04:13:10.830 --> 04:13:10.840 align:start position:0%
would say Okay
 
04:13:14.229 --> 04:13:14.239 align:start position:0%
4159 let's go 50/50
 
04:13:16.830 --> 04:13:16.840 align:start position:0%
but we're not getting there so I'm still
 
04:13:19.510 --> 04:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
standing for property tax relief I am
 
04:13:22.269 --> 04:13:22.279 align:start position:0%
also standing for the taxpayers of
 
04:13:25.189 --> 04:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
Wilman and Sutton that I campaigned on
 
04:13:27.189 --> 04:13:27.199 align:start position:0%
this there would be property tax relief
 
04:13:30.790 --> 04:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
and if I'm the only uh Democrat that
 
04:13:32.429 --> 04:13:32.439 align:start position:0%
will stand up for that that's what I'm
 
04:13:37.670 --> 04:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
going to do so I once again uh uh do not
 
04:13:41.229 --> 04:13:41.239 align:start position:0%
favor the approach being taken by the
 
04:13:45.750 --> 04:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:49.950 --> 04:13:49.960 align:start position:0%
seeing no other desire to speak I'll ask
 
04:13:52.590 --> 04:13:52.600 align:start position:0%
the clerk to call the
 
04:13:59.030 --> 04:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:03.429 --> 04:14:03.439 align:start position:0%
you get caught up here this is
 
04:14:03.439 --> 04:14:06.790 align:start position:0%
you get caught up here this is
255

04:14:06.790 --> 04:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:09.070 --> 04:14:09.080 align:start position:0%

we were discussing the Wayfair uh uh
 
04:17:58.670 --> 04:17:58.680 align:start position:0%

committee uh representative Aly was
 
04:18:05.349 --> 04:18:05.359 align:start position:0%

thoroughly I was in favor of this type
 
04:18:11.229 --> 04:18:11.239 align:start position:0%
of activity however uh I will quote from
 
04:18:13.710 --> 04:18:13.720 align:start position:0%
a a comment of the uh Attorney General
 
04:18:15.189 --> 04:18:15.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire attorney general at the
 
04:18:17.630 --> 04:18:17.640 align:start position:0%
time no argument was presented in
 
04:18:20.309 --> 04:18:20.319 align:start position:0%
Wayfair that South Dakota's collections
 
04:18:23.429 --> 04:18:23.439 align:start position:0%
e efforts were prohibited by Protections
 
04:18:26.229 --> 04:18:26.239 align:start position:0%
in another State's Constitution that was
 
04:18:29.269 --> 04:18:29.279 align:start position:0%
just not an issue uh the uh do Hampshire
 
04:18:31.070 --> 04:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
attorney general went on to say that all
 
04:18:33.750 --> 04:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
this all that the Wayfair decision did
 
04:18:36.109 --> 04:18:36.119 align:start position:0%
was shift the point of sale from where
 
04:18:39.070 --> 04:18:39.080 align:start position:0%
the money was collected to where the
 
04:18:45.030 --> 04:18:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:47.149 --> 04:18:47.159 align:start position:0%
representative elme could just add a bit
 
04:18:50.309 --> 04:18:50.319 align:start position:0%
to that uh representative major and I
 
04:18:54.550 --> 04:18:54.560 align:start position:0%
worked this issue delaying it for many
 
04:18:58.269 --> 04:18:58.279 align:start position:0%
years uh but it went to the US Supreme
 
04:19:02.389 --> 04:19:02.399 align:start position:0%
Court it had about 45 of the states
 
04:19:06.469 --> 04:19:06.479 align:start position:0%
behind it and it had one state us
 
04:19:10.229 --> 04:19:10.239 align:start position:0%
against it and the US Supreme Court
 
04:19:13.309 --> 04:19:13.319 align:start position:0%
decided the issue and
 
04:19:17.950 --> 04:19:17.960 align:start position:0%
and uh put and suggested guidelines
 
04:19:21.389 --> 04:19:21.399 align:start position:0%
guard guard rails for it uh in their
 
04:19:22.990 --> 04:19:23.000 align:start position:0%
report both the majority and The
 
04:19:27.189 --> 04:19:27.199 align:start position:0%
Minority Report suggested guard rails uh
 
04:19:30.750 --> 04:19:30.760 align:start position:0%
and what the bill that we crafted
 
04:19:34.149 --> 04:19:34.159 align:start position:0%
together all of us uh including Jess
 
04:19:38.990 --> 04:19:39.000 align:start position:0%
Edwards in the end yeah uh uh s did was
 
04:19:43.149 --> 04:19:43.159 align:start position:0%
to say if you go if you violate these
 
04:19:46.630 --> 04:19:46.640 align:start position:0%
implicit guard rails we're take we'll
 
04:19:49.030 --> 04:19:49.040 align:start position:0%
we'll figure out how to take you to the
 
04:19:50.750 --> 04:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court
 
04:19:50.760 --> 04:19:52.309 align:start position:0%
