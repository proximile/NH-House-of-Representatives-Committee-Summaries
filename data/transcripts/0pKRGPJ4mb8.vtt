00:07:15.629 --> 00:07:15.639 align:start position:0%
morning uh what we have done in the past
 
00:07:19.309 --> 00:07:19.319 align:start position:0%
is uh We've uh and I want to just Begin
 
00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:21.280 align:start position:0%
by saying that everyone who has signed
 
00:07:23.869 --> 00:07:23.879 align:start position:0%
in so far has signed up in support of
 
00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:25.840 align:start position:0%
the bill no one has signed up in
 
00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:27.800 align:start position:0%
opposition to the bill
 
00:07:30.469 --> 00:07:30.479 align:start position:0%
today what we typic Ty Al do is allow
 
00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:33.080 align:start position:0%
the sponsors to talk uh for up to five
 
00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:36.840 align:start position:0%
minutes to introduce the bill and I
 
00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:38.680 align:start position:0%
would and generally what we try to do is
 
00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
hold everybody to approximately three
 
00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:44.280 align:start position:0%
minutes in uh speaking time
 
00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:47.240 align:start position:0%
today and and frankly only I think only
 
00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:49.720 align:start position:0%
one person's asked for a little bit more
 
00:07:51.149 --> 00:07:51.159 align:start position:0%
than three
 
00:07:54.189 --> 00:07:54.199 align:start position:0%
minutes the primary sponsor of this bill
 
00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:57.120 align:start position:0%
is Senator Rosenwald and I see Senator
 
00:07:58.869 --> 00:07:58.879 align:start position:0%
Rosenwald you're there would you like to
 
00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
introduce your bill today thank you Mr
 
00:08:04.309 --> 00:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
chairman for the record I am Cindy
 
00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:07.800 align:start position:0%
rosenal from Senate District 13 which is
 
00:08:11.869 --> 00:08:11.879 align:start position:0%
the majority part of nashwa and I will
 
00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:15.120 align:start position:0%
not be speaking for five minutes um I'm
 
00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:17.120 align:start position:0%
here to introduced Senate Bill
 
00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
399 this bill will clarify that
 
00:08:24.149 --> 00:08:24.159 align:start position:0%
ultrasound is only required prior to
 
00:08:27.309 --> 00:08:27.319 align:start position:0%
performing an abortion at least 24 weeks
 
00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:30.280 align:start position:0%
into pregnancy we we've been told that
 
00:08:33.389 --> 00:08:33.399 align:start position:0%
it was never the intention of the 24
 
00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:36.760 align:start position:0%
week band sponsors the original
 
00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:40.320 align:start position:0%
sponsors that um ultrasound would be
 
00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:44.200 align:start position:0%
required in all cases therefore it's
 
00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:46.600 align:start position:0%
important to make this
 
00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:50.200 align:start position:0%
clarification and remove an unnecessary
 
00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:53.880 align:start position:0%
procedure and expense to patients when
 
00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:56.920 align:start position:0%
ultrasound is not the clinical standard
 
00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:00.200 align:start position:0%
of Care thank you Mr chair
 
00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:01.720 align:start position:0%

rosenell seeing none thank you for your
 
00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
brief testimony
 
00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:28.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:33.550 align:start position:0%
 
huitt

00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:33.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:34.600 align:start position:0%
I think you have to turn on the
 
00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:36.560 align:start position:0%
microphone there's a old button there
 
00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:40.040 align:start position:0%
there you go can hear me now Ian hwit uh
 
00:09:42.269 --> 00:09:42.279 align:start position:0%
in support of Senate Bill 399 this
 
00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:44.120 align:start position:0%
discussion together a number of times
 
00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:45.560 align:start position:0%
and I will not repeat myself
 
00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:47.440 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily I'll just point to the
 
00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:49.720 align:start position:0%
implications of some changed
 
00:09:51.829 --> 00:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
circumstances the house has of course
 
00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
passed House Bill 1609 which creates an
 
00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
exception would create an exception to
 
00:09:59.550 --> 00:09:59.560 align:start position:0%
our current law for cases of fa fatal
 
00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
fetal abnormalities that means two
 
00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:04.160 align:start position:0%
things that are important should the
 
00:10:06.829 --> 00:10:06.839 align:start position:0%
committee consider an amendment which
 
00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:09.240 align:start position:0%
removes enforcement capacity from our
 
00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
current law Andor which creates an
 
00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:14.320 align:start position:0%
open-ended exception first at least as
 
00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:16.200 align:start position:0%
far as the house is concerned we are now
 
00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
talking about a law which is even more
 
00:10:21.069 --> 00:10:21.079 align:start position:0%
moderate than the law which was in place
 
00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:23.480 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts prior to December of
 
00:10:26.069 --> 00:10:26.079 align:start position:0%
2020 which was a 24 week abortion
 
00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:28.600 align:start position:0%
prohibition with no exception for fetal
 
00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:29.990 align:start position:0%
prohibition with no exception for fetal
anomal

00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
anomal
 
00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
secondly because the house has already
 
00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:34.360 align:start position:0%
spoken on the issue of fatal fetal
 
00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
abnormalities should the committee
 
00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:38.600 align:start position:0%
pursue the kind of amendment that I
 
00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
describe the children whose deaths would
 
00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:43.240 align:start position:0%
be authorized would be children who are
 
00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:47.480 align:start position:0%
both older than 24 and are medically VI
 
00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:49.200 align:start position:0%
in other words children who could have
 
00:10:51.389 --> 00:10:51.399 align:start position:0%
lived had they been delivered instead of
 
00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:54.440 align:start position:0%
killed on the day of their abor it's not
 
00:10:56.069 --> 00:10:56.079 align:start position:0%
unlike of course some of the children
 
00:10:58.069 --> 00:10:58.079 align:start position:0%
whose corpses were recently discovered
 
00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:00.360 align:start position:0%
in Washington DC C which is a
 
00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction where the abortion provider
 
00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:04.160 align:start position:0%
who killed them will not face so much as
 
00:11:06.629 --> 00:11:06.639 align:start position:0%
a parking ticket that is the same
 
00:11:08.509 --> 00:11:08.519 align:start position:0%
impunity that an abortion provider would
 
00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
have enjoyed in New Hampshire prior to
 
00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
January of this year I pray that that
 
00:11:16.069 --> 00:11:16.079 align:start position:0%
fact would be of some moral significance
 
00:11:18.269 --> 00:11:18.279 align:start position:0%
to the members of the committee thank
 
00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:19.720 align:start position:0%
you and I would be happy to take any
 
00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:22.120 align:start position:0%
questions about the bill the law or
 
00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:23.680 align:start position:0%
related legal
 
00:11:27.949 --> 00:11:27.959 align:start position:0%
issues are there any questions for Mr
 
00:11:27.959 --> 00:11:30.430 align:start position:0%
issues are there any questions for Mr

00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
Montgomery good morning uh members of
 
00:11:43.069 --> 00:11:43.079 align:start position:0%
the Judiciary Committee my name is Kayla

Republic Affairs for Planned Parenthood
 
00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:47.720 align:start position:0%
Northern New England and our sister
 
00:11:49.949 --> 00:11:49.959 align:start position:0%
action fund we are here today to support
 
00:11:51.949 --> 00:11:51.959 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 399 and I will stick to the
 
00:11:56.509 --> 00:11:56.519 align:start position:0%
bill before you um this committee is uh
 
00:11:57.910 --> 00:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
you know has a lot of background on this
 
00:12:01.389 --> 00:12:01.399 align:start position:0%
bill already so I very brief um prior to
 
00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:03.240 align:start position:0%
January 1st of
 
00:12:05.949 --> 00:12:05.959 align:start position:0%
2022 this year conducting an ultrasound
 
00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:08.120 align:start position:0%
prior to an abortion was up to a
 
00:12:11.269 --> 00:12:11.279 align:start position:0%
clinician's uh best medical judgment the
 
00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:13.240 align:start position:0%
provider could work directly with the
 
00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
patient on whether an ultrasound was
 
00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:17.880 align:start position:0%
necessary but on January 1st the
 
00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:20.480 align:start position:0%
ultrasound provision went into effect
 
00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
and it is written in such a way that
 
00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:25.320 align:start position:0%
requires all patients in New Hampshire
 
00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:27.880 align:start position:0%
seeking an abortion to undergo an
 
00:12:30.269 --> 00:12:30.279 align:start position:0%
ultrasound whether medically necessary
 
00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:32.920 align:start position:0%
or not this provision is currently
 
00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:34.600 align:start position:0%
impacting patients who are seeking
 
00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:37.160 align:start position:0%
abortion care early in pregnancy so
 
00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:40.120 align:start position:0%
those who are prior to 11 weeks uh know
 
00:12:42.629 --> 00:12:42.639 align:start position:0%
the date of their last menstration and
 
00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:44.560 align:start position:0%
have uh no risk
 
00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:46.680 align:start position:0%
factors the ultrasound for those
 
00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:48.360 align:start position:0%
patients are not always medically
 
00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:50.720 align:start position:0%
necessary but they are now required to
 
00:12:53.389 --> 00:12:53.399 align:start position:0%
have one under the current law so under
 
00:12:55.389 --> 00:12:55.399 align:start position:0%
this current law again ultrasounds are
 
00:12:57.189 --> 00:12:57.199 align:start position:0%
mandatory no matter the individual
 
00:12:58.790 --> 00:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
circumstance or the recommend
 
00:13:01.389 --> 00:13:01.399 align:start position:0%
recommendation of the clinician so we
 
00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:03.800 align:start position:0%
support Senate Bill 399 because it
 
00:13:06.189 --> 00:13:06.199 align:start position:0%
clarifies the ultrasound requirement in
 
00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:08.440 align:start position:0%
relation to the newly enacted abortion
 
00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:11.560 align:start position:0%
bin so rather than prior to all abortion
 
00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:13.880 align:start position:0%
care which is the current law so this
 
00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
bill before you is one of three bills um
 
00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
that would currently address the
 
00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:20.320 align:start position:0%
ultrasound requirement the other being
 
00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:22.160 align:start position:0%

support just last month again that is
 
00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:34.760 align:start position:0%
the same language as well but in terms
 
00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:36.440 align:start position:0%
of this bill before you we would ask you

amendment 03 33s uh was incorporated
 
00:14:18.949 --> 00:14:18.959 align:start position:0%
into the bill to provide that Clarity
 
00:14:23.189 --> 00:14:23.199 align:start position:0%
that we need to um uh for the ultrasound
 
00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:27.160 align:start position:0%
at or near the 24-week
 
00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:29.320 align:start position:0%
period it's time
 
00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:32.920 align:start position:0%
to affirm this bill in in our
 
00:14:36.189 --> 00:14:36.199 align:start position:0%
legislature in our law body uh to
 
00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:40.120 align:start position:0%
protect um viable life in the womb in
 
00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:41.720 align:start position:0%
the third
 
00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:44.360 align:start position:0%
trimester while this bill it still gives
 
00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:45.389 align:start position:0%
trimester while this bill it still gives
us

00:14:45.389 --> 00:14:45.399 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:48.440 align:start position:0%
reasonable um ability for people to make
 
00:14:51.629 --> 00:14:51.639 align:start position:0%
decisions in the first and second
 
00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
trimester uh so if there's any question
 
00:14:58.670 --> 00:14:58.680 align:start position:0%
about what to do or when to do it uh
 
00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
there's there's fully 6 months for um a
 
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
woman and her family a partner to make
 
00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:06.629 align:start position:0%
woman and her family a partner to make
that

00:15:06.629 --> 00:15:06.639 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
decision most of the abortions uh by the
 
00:15:12.069 --> 00:15:12.079 align:start position:0%
statistics occur in the first
 
00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:15.440 align:start position:0%
trimester and some then in the second
 
00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:19.880 align:start position:0%
very few much much fewer in in the third
 
00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
and this is when life is viable this is
 
00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:25.000 align:start position:0%
when we have a living breathing well not
 
00:15:28.189 --> 00:15:28.199 align:start position:0%
yet breathing but a living and viable um
 
00:15:28.199 --> 00:15:29.269 align:start position:0%
yet breathing but a living and viable um
child

00:15:29.269 --> 00:15:29.279 align:start position:0%
child
 
00:15:33.189 --> 00:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
in the womb and to take that life that
 
00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:36.920 align:start position:0%
late is a travesty and I'm glad that New
 
00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:38.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is at the point where we can
 
00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:41.360 align:start position:0%
step back from that travesty and write
 
00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:42.920 align:start position:0%
this uh good
 
00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
legislation into law and uh I'm hoping
 
00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:50.600 align:start position:0%
that uh you you will pass it and uh it
 
00:15:53.189 --> 00:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
will be affirmed in our statutes to
 
00:15:56.269 --> 00:15:56.279 align:start position:0%
protect that viable and valuable and
 
00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:06.829 align:start position:0%
 
any

00:16:06.829 --> 00:16:06.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
questions sorry any questions for
 
00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:11.560 align:start position:0%
representative Stapleton singan thank
 
00:16:14.069 --> 00:16:14.079 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony
 
00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:21.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:25.069 --> 00:16:25.079 align:start position:0%
it as just stated my name is Sarah H and
 
00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:26.720 align:start position:0%
I want to thank you for the opportunity
 
00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
to speak today My Hope Is that today
 
00:16:33.389 --> 00:16:33.399 align:start position:0%
Bill SB 399 will not be turned into a
 
00:16:35.509 --> 00:16:35.519 align:start position:0%
gutting bill for the
 
00:16:38.189 --> 00:16:38.199 align:start position:0%
flpa that is the Fatal Life protection
 
00:16:40.309 --> 00:16:40.319 align:start position:0%
act there have been multiple attempts
 
00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:43.000 align:start position:0%
this year for that bill to be or act to
 
00:16:45.949 --> 00:16:45.959 align:start position:0%
be changed or modified to not protect
 
00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
The Unborn I understand many of those in
 
00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:50.600 align:start position:0%
support of abortion want to remove the
 
00:16:53.309 --> 00:16:53.319 align:start position:0%
flpa since abortion is seen as a morally
 
00:16:56.269 --> 00:16:56.279 align:start position:0%
correct act after all it protects
 
00:16:59.870 --> 00:16:59.880 align:start position:0%
woman's rights as a woman I am full in
 
00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:02.240 align:start position:0%
support of Rights for my sex the issue
 
00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:04.400 align:start position:0%
with abortion however is not over
 
00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:07.360 align:start position:0%
woman's rights as often portrayed many
 
00:17:08.949 --> 00:17:08.959 align:start position:0%
different arguments raised distract from
 
00:17:11.590 --> 00:17:11.600 align:start position:0%
the core issue when does an embryo
 
00:17:14.309 --> 00:17:14.319 align:start position:0%
become human to be clear when I use the
 
00:17:16.110 --> 00:17:16.120 align:start position:0%
word human I'm referring to someone
 
00:17:18.870 --> 00:17:18.880 align:start position:0%
equal to the rest of humanity in value
 
00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
and who has the right to life if an
 
00:17:23.829 --> 00:17:23.839 align:start position:0%
embryo is not a human there's no issue
 
00:17:26.549 --> 00:17:26.559 align:start position:0%
with abortion if the embryo is human
 
00:17:29.029 --> 00:17:29.039 align:start position:0%
then abortion is murder every other
 
00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
matter is secondary to this one question
 
00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:33.320 align:start position:0%
once it's resolved any other matter
 
00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:35.440 align:start position:0%
regarding abortion can be easily
 
00:17:37.789 --> 00:17:37.799 align:start position:0%
answered five elements change between
 
00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:39.720 align:start position:0%
conception and birth regarding the
 
00:17:42.669 --> 00:17:42.679 align:start position:0%
embryo size level of development
 
00:17:45.029 --> 00:17:45.039 align:start position:0%
environment degree of dependency and
 
00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:47.600 align:start position:0%
level of Consciousness let's start with
 
00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:51.240 align:start position:0%
size how does size give human life value
 
00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:53.200 align:start position:0%
humans range in different sizes but does
 
00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
not affect the value we have or the
 
00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:57.400 align:start position:0%
rights we possess as American citizens
 
00:18:00.029 --> 00:18:00.039 align:start position:0%
human value is greater than physical
 
00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
appearance level of development born
 
00:18:04.549 --> 00:18:04.559 align:start position:0%
babies are less developed than children
 
00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
children are less developed than teens
 
00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:08.440 align:start position:0%
when does level of development make
 
00:18:11.909 --> 00:18:11.919 align:start position:0%
someone else more valued environment
 
00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
someone's environment does not change
 
00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:15.960 align:start position:0%
their value someone cannot travel to any
 
00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:18.440 align:start position:0%
location in the universe and become less
 
00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:21.080 align:start position:0%
valuable to say a child's value hinges
 
00:18:24.149 --> 00:18:24.159 align:start position:0%
on the Journey of 8 Ines is ridiculous
 
00:18:25.909 --> 00:18:25.919 align:start position:0%
why bother with a C-section if they're
 
00:18:28.909 --> 00:18:28.919 align:start position:0%
not valuable until outside the womb
 
00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:31.480 align:start position:0%
degree of dependency the comos and
 
00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
disabled are all dependent on others
 
00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:35.000 align:start position:0%
born babies are dependent on their
 
00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:38.120 align:start position:0%
Guardians if not more so than an embryo
 
00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:40.440 align:start position:0%
degree of Consciousness Consciousness
 
00:18:42.669 --> 00:18:42.679 align:start position:0%
does not impact value someone in a coma
 
00:18:44.549 --> 00:18:44.559 align:start position:0%
is not less valuable someone with a
 
00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
severe mental disorder is not less
 
00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
valuable in the end what makes a human
 
00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:53.320 align:start position:0%
valuable is that they are human there's
 
00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
no extra criteria for a human to have
 
00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:57.280 align:start position:0%
worth the minute someone tries to place
 
00:18:59.110 --> 00:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
one on an embryo there will always be
 
00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
another human that is an exception when
 
00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:04.240 align:start position:0%
did Being Human no longer be enough to
 
00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
have the right to life abortion is not
 
00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:08.120 align:start position:0%
protecting woman's rights nor is it
 
00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:11.480 align:start position:0%
moral I hope today you'll let BS 399
 
00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:13.360 align:start position:0%
pass without modifying it to remove more
 
00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:14.320 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:19:16.789 --> 00:19:16.799 align:start position:0%
flpa in the future I hope you will
 
00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:18.400 align:start position:0%
continue to fight for the rights of
 
00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:20.360 align:start position:0%
those who cannot speak for themselves
 
00:19:22.789 --> 00:19:22.799 align:start position:0%
thank you for your
 
00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:26.280 align:start position:0%
time are there any questions from M
 
00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:28.520 align:start position:0%
hole seeing none thank you for your
 
00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:31.470 align:start position:0%
hole seeing none thank you for your
testimony

00:19:41.549 --> 00:19:41.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
manasi good morning and thank you for
 
00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:46.480 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to speak here today good
 
00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:49.880 align:start position:0%
morning I am Karen I am Karen manasi I'm
 
00:19:51.909 --> 00:19:51.919 align:start position:0%
a retired occupational therapist with
 
00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:53.320 align:start position:0%
degrees and
 
00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:56.280 align:start position:0%
biology and occupational therapy I'm
 
00:19:59.029 --> 00:19:59.039 align:start position:0%
also the mother of three twin Sons
 
00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
and a child whose life ended in an
 
00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:04.480 align:start position:0%
abortion clinic over 30 years ago I'm
 
00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:06.640 align:start position:0%
here to urge the committee to vote ought
 
00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
to pass on Senate Bill 399 as amended by
 
00:20:12.909 --> 00:20:12.919 align:start position:0%
the Senate by doing so you would be
 
00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:16.120 align:start position:0%
strengthening an already sound late term
 
00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
abortion ban in a state that protects
 
00:20:21.549 --> 00:20:21.559 align:start position:0%
viably late term children just weeks
 
00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:24.320 align:start position:0%
before their birth I oppose any attempt
 
00:20:26.149 --> 00:20:26.159 align:start position:0%
to amend the law and Committee in a way
 
00:20:28.789 --> 00:20:28.799 align:start position:0%
that would render it unenforceable
 
00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:31.640 align:start position:0%
and incapable of Defending even a single
 
00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
child much has been made of the need to
 
00:20:36.549 --> 00:20:36.559 align:start position:0%
give women absolute say over whether the
 
00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:40.520 align:start position:0%
child they carry lives or dies but few
 
00:20:43.549 --> 00:20:43.559 align:start position:0%
speak of that child who through no fault
 
00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:46.280 align:start position:0%
of their own is killed before even being
 
00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:49.480 align:start position:0%
able to take a single breath outside the
 
00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:52.440 align:start position:0%
womb a child's right to live can't only
 
00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:55.240 align:start position:0%
be based on whether they are convenient
 
00:20:59.149 --> 00:20:59.159 align:start position:0%
or wanted certainly we can B reasonable
 
00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:02.120 align:start position:0%
protections for viable pre-born while
 
00:21:04.909 --> 00:21:04.919 align:start position:0%
still providing women ample opportunity
 
00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
to seek an abortion if that is their
 
00:21:12.149 --> 00:21:12.159 align:start position:0%
decision to hear those who oppose any
 
00:21:13.909 --> 00:21:13.919 align:start position:0%
restrictions you would think
 
00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:17.200 align:start position:0%
women always make loving supportive and
 
00:21:19.269 --> 00:21:19.279 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable decisions to terminate the
 
00:21:20.669 --> 00:21:20.679 align:start position:0%
young lives they
 
00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:23.240 align:start position:0%
carry that was not my
 
00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:27.200 align:start position:0%
experience as a young woman like so many
 
00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:30.400 align:start position:0%
I was faced with an unexpected pregnancy
 
00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
with a father who did not want the
 
00:21:37.789 --> 00:21:37.799 align:start position:0%
child unsupported afraid and panicked I
 
00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:40.760 align:start position:0%
scraped up the money for an abortion and
 
00:21:42.669 --> 00:21:42.679 align:start position:0%
I walked in
 
00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:45.480 align:start position:0%
alone no one had told me the violence of
 
00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:47.000 align:start position:0%
what was to
 
00:21:52.549 --> 00:21:52.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
felt the pain of having life torn out of
 
00:21:59.630 --> 00:21:59.640 align:start position:0%
your body by force you couldn't
 
00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:03.440 align:start position:0%
understand there was no connection no
 
00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:06.480 align:start position:0%
compassion from the Doctor Who Never
 
00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
introduced herself to
 
00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:12.840 align:start position:0%
me and never acknowledged
 
00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
me before painfully violating my body
 
00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
and ending the life of my
 
00:22:20.549 --> 00:22:20.559 align:start position:0%
child and this was in my first three
 
00:22:22.149 --> 00:22:22.159 align:start position:0%
months of
 
00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:24.520 align:start position:0%
pregnancy we need to take a moment and
 
00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
think about these fully formed children
 
00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:28.720 align:start position:0%
in the last trimester
 
00:22:31.549 --> 00:22:31.559 align:start position:0%
on what has to happen to forcibly in
 
00:22:31.559 --> 00:22:33.390 align:start position:0%
on what has to happen to forcibly in
their

00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:33.400 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:36.520 align:start position:0%
lives we argue on the margins of extreme
 
00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:38.760 align:start position:0%
examples and ignore those children who
 
00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:42.440 align:start position:0%
have a true chance at life a 24-week ban
 
00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
with exceptions for the health of the
 
00:22:46.350 --> 00:22:46.360 align:start position:0%
mother is not
 
00:22:48.669 --> 00:22:48.679 align:start position:0%
extreme and for those women who still
 
00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
want to abort their late term children
 
00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:53.080 align:start position:0%
there are bordering states that would be
 
00:22:55.149 --> 00:22:55.159 align:start position:0%
happy to accommodate
 
00:22:58.789 --> 00:22:58.799 align:start position:0%
them just as New Hampshire no doubt did
 
00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
when we had abortion on demand for any
 
00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
reason up to the uh moment of birth I
 
00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:07.360 align:start position:0%
urge the committee to pass Senate Bill
 
00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:10.400 align:start position:0%
399 as currently amended by the Senate
 
00:23:12.789 --> 00:23:12.799 align:start position:0%
and keep these modest Protections in
 
00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:15.720 align:start position:0%
place for those who cannot defend
 
00:23:18.669 --> 00:23:18.679 align:start position:0%
themselves thank you for
 
00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
listening are there any
 
00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:38.070 align:start position:0%
 
today

00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
Azam good
 
00:23:50.789 --> 00:23:50.799 align:start position:0%
morning um my name is Laura al-azam I'm
 
00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
from londonairy and if you don't mind
 
00:23:54.549 --> 00:23:54.559 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to look at my notes for a
 
00:23:56.669 --> 00:23:56.679 align:start position:0%
quick moment
 
00:23:59.510 --> 00:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
um I I have had the opportunity to talk
 
00:24:01.789 --> 00:24:01.799 align:start position:0%
to people in my community about uh the
 
00:24:03.549 --> 00:24:03.559 align:start position:0%
bills that are before the legislature
 
00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
this year regarding the 24 week abortion
 
00:24:09.549 --> 00:24:09.559 align:start position:0%
restriction um and most of them
 
00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:10.600 align:start position:0%
understand what the fetal Life
 
00:24:13.029 --> 00:24:13.039 align:start position:0%
protection act is and that it was just
 
00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
recently enacted and they're wondering
 
00:24:17.149 --> 00:24:17.159 align:start position:0%
why we would mess with it so quickly
 
00:24:19.029 --> 00:24:19.039 align:start position:0%
after it was enacted you know why don't
 
00:24:20.549 --> 00:24:20.559 align:start position:0%
we just give it a chance to work and see
 
00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:23.200 align:start position:0%
how it goes most of them like a strong
 
00:24:25.029 --> 00:24:25.039 align:start position:0%
majority of New Hampshire citizens and
 
00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
Americans support restrictions on
 
00:24:30.389 --> 00:24:30.399 align:start position:0%
abortion and they recognize that what we
 
00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
have now has moved New Hampshire from an
 
00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
extreme position enabling abortion up
 
00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:38.240 align:start position:0%
until birth um to a more mainstream
 
00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:42.360 align:start position:0%
albeit still permissive um abortion
 
00:24:44.909 --> 00:24:44.919 align:start position:0%
position and most are familiar with the
 
00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
ultrasound procedure and were kind of
 
00:24:48.789 --> 00:24:48.799 align:start position:0%
baffled to hear over the course of last
 
00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:51.440 align:start position:0%
summer and fall that um there was a
 
00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:53.360 align:start position:0%
media campaign that very aggressively
 
00:24:56.310 --> 00:24:56.320 align:start position:0%
pushed the ultrasound wording as um
 
00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:00.440 align:start position:0%
intrusive extraord orinary extreme and
 
00:25:02.389 --> 00:25:02.399 align:start position:0%
really that portrayal was just baffling
 
00:25:04.029 --> 00:25:04.039 align:start position:0%
to most of the people i' had spoken with
 
00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:05.960 align:start position:0%
who had been pregnant before and gone
 
00:25:08.350 --> 00:25:08.360 align:start position:0%
through the usual doctor's appointments
 
00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:10.640 align:start position:0%
but given this bad information in the
 
00:25:13.549 --> 00:25:13.559 align:start position:0%
media I do support the clarification of
 
00:25:16.430 --> 00:25:16.440 align:start position:0%
the ultrasound wording um and therefore
 
00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:20.120 align:start position:0%
I just strongly support um SB 399 as
 
00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:22.440 align:start position:0%
amended by the Senate and I hope that
 
00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
you will um pass it as such and not
 
00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
change the wording in any ways now thank
 
00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:32.240 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
 
00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:34.240 align:start position:0%

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:36.029 align:start position:0%

00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:47.480 align:start position:0%
petal need to take the box away good

morning and thank you for hearing my
 
00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
testimony and support of Senate Bill 399
 
00:25:54.269 --> 00:25:54.279 align:start position:0%
as amended by the Senate this is the
 
00:25:55.710 --> 00:25:55.720 align:start position:0%
second time this session that I have
 
00:25:57.110 --> 00:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
come before the house Judiciary
 
00:25:58.950 --> 00:25:58.960 align:start position:0%
Committee I have also testified
 
00:26:00.549 --> 00:26:00.559 align:start position:0%
regarding House Bill
 
00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:03.080 align:start position:0%
1673 considering the similarity between
 
00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:05.000 align:start position:0%
these bills that written testimony is
 
00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:07.240 align:start position:0%
included as well my name is Katie
 
00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:08.960 align:start position:0%
peternell I live in wolfboro with my
 
00:26:11.389 --> 00:26:11.399 align:start position:0%
husband we raised four daughters there I
 
00:26:14.110 --> 00:26:14.120 align:start position:0%
have a Bachelor of Science and nursing I
 
00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:16.440 align:start position:0%
stand before you today as a woman who
 
00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:18.360 align:start position:0%
has had far too many experiences
 
00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
surrounding life issues as an adopte as
 
00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:24.320 align:start position:0%
a birth mother as the grandmother of a
 
00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:26.360 align:start position:0%
beautiful 5-month-old grandson from an
 
00:26:29.389 --> 00:26:29.399 align:start position:0%
unplanned unwed pregn pry as a friend of
 
00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
women who have shared their stories of
 
00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:33.640 align:start position:0%
abortion as an attendee of retreats to
 
00:26:35.230 --> 00:26:35.240 align:start position:0%
heal the suffering of post-abortive
 
00:26:37.909 --> 00:26:37.919 align:start position:0%
women and the mother of a son who was
 
00:26:41.269 --> 00:26:41.279 align:start position:0%
delivered early at 23 weeks gestation I
 
00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:43.120 align:start position:0%
think I have a very valid opinion on the
 
00:26:45.389 --> 00:26:45.399 align:start position:0%
fetal Life protection act and attempts
 
00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:48.760 align:start position:0%
to amend or repeal it of all of my
 
00:26:50.549 --> 00:26:50.559 align:start position:0%
experiences I think that the most
 
00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:52.120 align:start position:0%
pertinent to today's hearing is the
 
00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
emergent delivery of my son at 23 weeks
 
00:26:57.590 --> 00:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
in order to save one life as opposed to
 
00:26:59.710 --> 00:26:59.720 align:start position:0%
losing two he was delivered via
 
00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:02.640 align:start position:0%
C-section followed by a hysterectomy the
 
00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:05.640 align:start position:0%
surgery to save my life lasted 8 hours
 
00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:08.200 align:start position:0%
and and required the transfusion of four
 
00:27:10.750 --> 00:27:10.760 align:start position:0%
units of blood this decision was not one
 
00:27:12.789 --> 00:27:12.799 align:start position:0%
my husband and I took lightly and I was
 
00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:15.240 align:start position:0%
willing to Die to Save the life of my
 
00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:18.320 align:start position:0%
son the night before the surgery I will
 
00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:21.240 align:start position:0%
never forget lying in the hospital bed
 
00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:24.360 align:start position:0%
feeling my son kicking and moving around
 
00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
he was very active while I lay there I
 
00:27:30.269 --> 00:27:30.279 align:start position:0%
kept silently asking him to please stop
 
00:27:34.029 --> 00:27:34.039 align:start position:0%
moving please stop moving after the
 
00:27:36.149 --> 00:27:36.159 align:start position:0%
surgery they brought the body of my
 
00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:39.000 align:start position:0%
23-week old son to me although I was in
 
00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:42.600 align:start position:0%
the stuper of anesthesia I can still 18
 
00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:45.840 align:start position:0%

sing us to enact laws that conform to
 
00:29:42.750 --> 00:29:42.760 align:start position:0%
God when the Supreme Court in
 
00:29:46.789 --> 00:29:46.799 align:start position:0%
73 allowed abortion it was a violation
 
00:29:50.990 --> 00:29:51.000 align:start position:0%
against the law of God and and the
 
00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
Constitution and your duty our
 
00:29:57.269 --> 00:29:57.279 align:start position:0%
Collective duty is to change it it's
 
00:29:58.669 --> 00:29:58.679 align:start position:0%
it's not an
 
00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:00.480 align:start position:0%
option I
 
00:30:04.789 --> 00:30:04.799 align:start position:0%
was I think 14 watching Walter kronite
 
00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:07.320 align:start position:0%
with my father hearing the announcement
 
00:30:10.590 --> 00:30:10.600 align:start position:0%
of that decision and my father who had a
 
00:30:12.590 --> 00:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
career in human
 
00:30:15.950 --> 00:30:15.960 align:start position:0%
services taking care of the mentally
 
00:30:19.870 --> 00:30:19.880 align:start position:0%
physically disabled said to me Greg
 
00:30:22.789 --> 00:30:22.799 align:start position:0%
you'll get worse as bad as this
 
00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
is you'll see the death of the elderly
 
00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
and the force killing of the disabled
 
00:30:32.669 --> 00:30:32.679 align:start position:0%
and you may say that doesn't happen now
 
00:30:37.710 --> 00:30:37.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:41.549 --> 00:30:41.559 align:start position:0%
will Cas from Point University of
 
00:30:44.269 --> 00:30:44.279 align:start position:0%

00:30:51.310 --> 00:30:51.320 align:start position:0%

00:30:59.710 --> 00:30:59.720 align:start position:0%
procedures with other
 
00:31:02.669 --> 00:31:02.679 align:start position:0%
organs and from a foil
 
00:31:05.269 --> 00:31:05.279 align:start position:0%
request we learned that the US
 
00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:07.360 align:start position:0%
government and its academic
 
00:31:11.070 --> 00:31:11.080 align:start position:0%
Partners prefer fresh and never Frozen
 
00:31:12.470 --> 00:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
baby body
 
00:31:15.950 --> 00:31:15.960 align:start position:0%
parts meaning that the specimens these
 
00:31:21.269 --> 00:31:21.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:24.190 --> 00:31:24.200 align:start position:0%
alive I I can't believe that we're
 
00:31:26.629 --> 00:31:26.639 align:start position:0%
debating that whether there's human life
 
00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
here or not we know that life begins at
 
00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:31.840 align:start position:0%
conception from the union of the sperm
 
00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:38.549 --> 00:31:38.559 align:start position:0%
Egg and I lost my train of thought
 
00:31:41.870 --> 00:31:41.880 align:start position:0%
here but if there's any doubt it's to
 
00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:44.760 align:start position:0%
look at photos of aborted
 
00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
babies and it's
 
00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
gruesome and these babies
 
00:31:52.389 --> 00:31:52.399 align:start position:0%
from uh to where you really can't
 
00:31:55.230 --> 00:31:55.240 align:start position:0%
discern the form to where they're fully
 
00:31:57.430 --> 00:31:57.440 align:start position:0%
formed and those are the photos that we
 
00:32:00.029 --> 00:32:00.039 align:start position:0%
all need to look at to remind ourselves
 
00:32:02.389 --> 00:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
of this
 
00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
Duty what is abortion there's many types
 
00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
this the use of medication that causes
 
00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:10.870 align:start position:0%
this the use of medication that causes
the

00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:10.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:12.389 align:start position:0%
the
premature

00:32:12.389 --> 00:32:12.399 align:start position:0%
premature
 
00:32:16.190 --> 00:32:16.200 align:start position:0%
miscarriage of the child there's a dil
 
00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:17.600 align:start position:0%
dilation in
 
00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:20.120 align:start position:0%
curage where the baby is basically
 
00:32:23.029 --> 00:32:23.039 align:start position:0%
sucked out of the womb and often times
 
00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:25.320 align:start position:0%
dismembered through that
 
00:32:29.389 --> 00:32:29.399 align:start position:0%
procedure there's dilation and and an
 
00:32:31.629 --> 00:32:31.639 align:start position:0%
evacuation where the baby's actually
 
00:32:35.389 --> 00:32:35.399 align:start position:0%
physically dismembered and suctioned out
 
00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
and then there's induction abortion
 
00:32:39.509 --> 00:32:39.519 align:start position:0%
where the baby's injected with a poison
 
00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:42.360 align:start position:0%
that cause cardiac arrest and induced
 
00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:45.200 align:start position:0%
labor often the woman's has to carry
 
00:32:47.629 --> 00:32:47.639 align:start position:0%
that baby dead for two or three days
 
00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:51.480 align:start position:0%
before the body naturally expels
 
00:32:55.950 --> 00:32:55.960 align:start position:0%
it this is not just to the baby or to
 
00:32:59.669 --> 00:32:59.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:03.149 --> 00:33:03.159 align:start position:0%
what's even more upsetting is that 40 50
 
00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:07.120 align:start position:0%
years ago this would have been we we
 
00:33:10.269 --> 00:33:10.279 align:start position:0%
would have been a gast at this it's
 
00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
these types of crimes which nberg after
 
00:33:18.750 --> 00:33:18.760 align:start position:0%
the defeat of Nazi Germany the
 
00:33:21.990 --> 00:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
trials were held to hold
 
00:33:24.549 --> 00:33:24.559 align:start position:0%
account on these
 
00:33:27.669 --> 00:33:27.679 align:start position:0%
abuses part of what nberg went after
 
00:33:30.669 --> 00:33:30.679 align:start position:0%
were crimes against humanity which were
 
00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:34.720 align:start position:0%
defined as murder
 
00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
extermination enslavement deportment and
 
00:33:40.549 --> 00:33:40.559 align:start position:0%
other inhumane acts committed against
 
00:33:43.269 --> 00:33:43.279 align:start position:0%
any civil
 
00:33:46.389 --> 00:33:46.399 align:start position:0%
population in response many of the
 
00:33:48.269 --> 00:33:48.279 align:start position:0%
perpetrators were held to
 
00:33:51.509 --> 00:33:51.519 align:start position:0%
Justice and what resulted was a nberg
 
00:33:53.909 --> 00:33:53.919 align:start position:0%
code 10
 
00:33:57.590 --> 00:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
points three of which are most relevant
 
00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
one the voluntary consent of the human
 
00:34:03.430 --> 00:34:03.440 align:start position:0%
subject is absolutely
 
00:34:06.029 --> 00:34:06.039 align:start position:0%
essential the next the experiment should
 
00:34:09.230 --> 00:34:09.240 align:start position:0%
be avoided or I should say should be
 
00:34:12.190 --> 00:34:12.200 align:start position:0%
conducted as to avoid all unnecessary
 
00:34:14.829 --> 00:34:14.839 align:start position:0%
physical and mental suffering and
 
00:34:18.270 --> 00:34:18.280 align:start position:0%
injury and the next is no experiment
 
00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:20.280 align:start position:0%
should be conducted where there is a
 
00:34:23.550 --> 00:34:23.560 align:start position:0%
aprior reason to believe that death or
 
00:34:25.869 --> 00:34:25.879 align:start position:0%
disabling injury will will
 
00:34:25.879 --> 00:34:27.589 align:start position:0%
disabling injury will will
occur

00:34:27.589 --> 00:34:27.599 align:start position:0%
occur
 
00:34:30.990 --> 00:34:31.000 align:start position:0%
well abortion goes Way Beyond this as we
 
00:34:34.190 --> 00:34:34.200 align:start position:0%
know it takes to life if it didn't why
 
00:34:37.790 --> 00:34:37.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:40.510 --> 00:34:40.520 align:start position:0%
procedure so in
 
00:34:43.349 --> 00:34:43.359 align:start position:0%
conclusion I think it's quite obvious
 
00:34:46.349 --> 00:34:46.359 align:start position:0%
what the moral duty is the duty before
 
00:34:49.430 --> 00:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
God the duty in conformance to the
 
00:34:51.829 --> 00:34:51.839 align:start position:0%
Constitution and I ask that you always
 
00:34:54.669 --> 00:34:54.679 align:start position:0%
support the right to life and thank you
 
00:34:55.869 --> 00:34:55.879 align:start position:0%

00:34:55.879 --> 00:34:57.510 align:start position:0%
for your
help

questions seeing none thank you
 
00:35:14.829 --> 00:35:14.839 align:start position:0%

Chester thank you committee chair thank
 
00:35:19.270 --> 00:35:19.280 align:start position:0%
you sorry thank you committee chair
 
00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:21.280 align:start position:0%
thank you committee members my name is
 
00:35:23.589 --> 00:35:23.599 align:start position:0%
russan Chester I'm a resident of Bedford
 
00:35:28.829 --> 00:35:28.839 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and uh I am um I was born
 
00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:32.480 align:start position:0%
in the 60s but uh I was fortunate enough
 
00:35:36.349 --> 00:35:36.359 align:start position:0%
not to uh have a lot of problems even
 
00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
though I was born premature um and
 
00:35:43.829 --> 00:35:43.839 align:start position:0%
possibly um at that at or right around
 
00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
that 24 we gation period
 
00:35:52.990 --> 00:35:53.000 align:start position:0%
um that being said uh I think anytime
 
00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
we're taking out ultrasounds it the the
 
00:35:58.309 --> 00:35:58.319 align:start position:0%
abortion process process is different
 
00:36:02.349 --> 00:36:02.359 align:start position:0%
depending on what trimester the woman is
 
00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
in not having an ultrasound in the
 
00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:15.109 --> 00:36:15.119 align:start position:0%
the for second or third term trimesters
 
00:36:17.790 --> 00:36:17.800 align:start position:0%
you are taking the chance of not only
 
00:36:20.990 --> 00:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
not only having a botched abortion and
 
00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:23.440 align:start position:0%
I'm sure you folks now have seen a lot
 
00:36:26.510 --> 00:36:26.520 align:start position:0%
of these babies that have been born um
 
00:36:29.630 --> 00:36:29.640 align:start position:0%
who are now young children and teenagers
 
00:36:31.829 --> 00:36:31.839 align:start position:0%
from these botched abortions if you
 
00:36:34.470 --> 00:36:34.480 align:start position:0%
haven't check it out it's pretty awful
 
00:36:37.470 --> 00:36:37.480 align:start position:0%
that what they've gone through um with
 
00:36:39.390 --> 00:36:39.400 align:start position:0%
regards to that third trimester
 
00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
abortions are extremely dangerous for um
 
00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
it being a botched abortion but it's
 
00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:47.800 align:start position:0%
also extremely D dangerous for the woman
 
00:36:49.950 --> 00:36:49.960 align:start position:0%
who's made that choice it's something
 
00:36:54.790 --> 00:36:54.800 align:start position:0%
they don't tell you I I am um someone
 
00:36:57.550 --> 00:36:57.560 align:start position:0%
who had an abortion because I thought it
 
00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:01.200 align:start position:0%
was my right my body my choice I had an
 
00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:04.720 align:start position:0%
abortion and I finally realized 15 years
 
00:37:08.109 --> 00:37:08.119 align:start position:0%
later that that choice carried a lot of
 
00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:10.160 align:start position:0%
consequences for me it carried a lot of
 
00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:13.560 align:start position:0%
consequences emotionally and physically
 
00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
I lied about how far along I was on
 
00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:19.480 align:start position:0%
purpose so that I could have the
 
00:37:23.390 --> 00:37:23.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
entitled I beg all of you to really look
 
00:37:30.829 --> 00:37:30.839 align:start position:0%
at this I've just found out last night
 
00:37:33.550 --> 00:37:33.560 align:start position:0%
that according to our state laws if a
 
00:37:37.230 --> 00:37:37.240 align:start position:0%
woman dies during the abortion process
 
00:37:40.829 --> 00:37:40.839 align:start position:0%
the the abortion clinic is not required
 
00:37:40.839 --> 00:37:41.630 align:start position:0%
the the abortion clinic is not required
to

00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:41.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:37:45.230 --> 00:37:45.240 align:start position:0%
notify the coroner they notify next they
 
00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:47.680 align:start position:0%
notify their emergency contact and the
 
00:37:50.069 --> 00:37:50.079 align:start position:0%
emergency contact does that that's part
 
00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:52.640 align:start position:0%
of the reason why we don't see women in
 
00:37:55.150 --> 00:37:55.160 align:start position:0%
our state dying from botched
 
00:37:58.710 --> 00:37:58.720 align:start position:0%
abortions um I suspect I need to look
 
00:38:04.270 --> 00:38:04.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
2022 to prevent abortions there's
 
00:38:11.390 --> 00:38:11.400 align:start position:0%
absolutely no reason to have to to to to
 
00:38:14.950 --> 00:38:14.960 align:start position:0%
be to be um doing this kind of process
 
00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:18.880 align:start position:0%
at least without the ultrasound um being
 
00:38:23.230 --> 00:38:23.240 align:start position:0%
included um and I feel most importantly
 
00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
that provided the appropriate education
 
00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:31.200 align:start position:0%
if these um clinics truly provided the
 
00:38:33.829 --> 00:38:33.839 align:start position:0%
appropriate education to the woman about
 
00:38:36.390 --> 00:38:36.400 align:start position:0%
all the different options that are
 
00:38:39.230 --> 00:38:39.240 align:start position:0%
available to them that we would see
 
00:38:43.630 --> 00:38:43.640 align:start position:0%
abortion go down drastically I also am
 
00:38:46.230 --> 00:38:46.240 align:start position:0%
um a birth mom I released a child for
 
00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:49.440 align:start position:0%
adoption after my abortion 15 years
 
00:38:52.069 --> 00:38:52.079 align:start position:0%
later I found myself pregnant
 
00:38:54.589 --> 00:38:54.599 align:start position:0%
again this time I made the adoption
 
00:38:57.190 --> 00:38:57.200 align:start position:0%
option available for her
 
00:39:01.069 --> 00:39:01.079 align:start position:0%
because I had learned how traumatic the
 
00:39:05.910 --> 00:39:05.920 align:start position:0%
choice of abortion is for women thank
 
00:39:09.109 --> 00:39:09.119 align:start position:0%
you you are there any questions from the
 
00:39:11.470 --> 00:39:11.480 align:start position:0%
committee represent Horgan did you have
 
00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:12.910 align:start position:0%
committee represent Horgan did you have
a

00:39:12.910 --> 00:39:12.920 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:39:15.270 --> 00:39:15.280 align:start position:0%
question yeah sure uh Miss Chester I
 
00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:17.200 align:start position:0%
know you've been heavily involved in the
 
00:39:23.829 --> 00:39:23.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:26.589 --> 00:39:26.599 align:start position:0%
childbearing age who are pregnant who've
 
00:39:29.790 --> 00:39:29.800 align:start position:0%
died from covid um and I don't know if
 
00:39:30.990 --> 00:39:31.000 align:start position:0%
you if you know the number you can
 
00:39:32.589 --> 00:39:32.599 align:start position:0%
probably if you happen to know the
 
00:39:34.349 --> 00:39:34.359 align:start position:0%
number you can share it with us or maybe
 
00:39:36.109 --> 00:39:36.119 align:start position:0%
not because that involves both the death
 
00:39:39.349 --> 00:39:39.359 align:start position:0%
of not just the mother but of uh the
 
00:39:42.829 --> 00:39:42.839 align:start position:0%
fetus or sometimes two or three fetuses
 
00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:48.720 align:start position:0%
carrying I think I need you to repeat
 
00:39:51.069 --> 00:39:51.079 align:start position:0%
the question I don't know how that how
 
00:39:52.510 --> 00:39:52.520 align:start position:0%
what that has to do with this bill
 
00:39:55.630 --> 00:39:55.640 align:start position:0%
before us today okay so um I was just I
 
00:39:57.470 --> 00:39:57.480 align:start position:0%
was just asking about the issue of
 
00:40:00.510 --> 00:40:00.520 align:start position:0%
pregnant women who die of covid and in
 
00:40:04.030 --> 00:40:04.040 align:start position:0%
which case they're not just uh you're
 
00:40:05.910 --> 00:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
not just losing the uh the pregnant
 
00:40:08.190 --> 00:40:08.200 align:start position:0%
woman but you're also losing the baby or
 
00:40:10.069 --> 00:40:10.079 align:start position:0%
in some cases some cases multiple
 
00:40:13.990 --> 00:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
fetuses who the woman is carrying and
 
00:40:16.030 --> 00:40:16.040 align:start position:0%
well the interesting part of that is if
 
00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:19.960 align:start position:0%
you identify that the the the the the
 
00:40:21.870 --> 00:40:21.880 align:start position:0%
thing that is growing inside the woman's
 
00:40:24.430 --> 00:40:24.440 align:start position:0%
stomach as a baby then abortion should
 
00:40:26.910 --> 00:40:26.920 align:start position:0%
be a crime against humanity
 
00:40:29.910 --> 00:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
if you don't if you ident if you say no
 
00:40:32.790 --> 00:40:32.800 align:start position:0%
it's just a bunch of cells then that's a
 
00:40:34.670 --> 00:40:34.680 align:start position:0%
different story but that's the bottom
 
00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
line here so I guess first we have to
 
00:40:41.150 --> 00:40:41.160 align:start position:0%
identify what is a baby um you know when
 
00:40:44.190 --> 00:40:44.200 align:start position:0%
does when does that gestational age
 
00:40:47.069 --> 00:40:47.079 align:start position:0%
become a baby if you want to say okay at
 
00:40:52.270 --> 00:40:52.280 align:start position:0%
25 weeks it's a baby um then that's
 
00:40:55.309 --> 00:40:55.319 align:start position:0%
another story is that they
 
00:40:55.319 --> 00:40:57.750 align:start position:0%
another story is that they
don't

00:40:57.750 --> 00:40:57.760 align:start position:0%
don't
 
00:41:02.109 --> 00:41:02.119 align:start position:0%
particularly they they don't ever ever
 
00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:10.750 --> 00:41:10.760 align:start position:0%
justalot of situations some of these
 
00:41:12.870 --> 00:41:12.880 align:start position:0%
some of these pregnant women that have
 
00:41:15.829 --> 00:41:15.839 align:start position:0%
died from covid have died from the
 
00:41:20.069 --> 00:41:20.079 align:start position:0%
treatments of the covid-19 um situation
 
00:41:22.829 --> 00:41:22.839 align:start position:0%
and not actually from covid so it's very
 
00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:24.640 align:start position:0%
hard to tease out right now we're only
 
00:41:27.349 --> 00:41:27.359 align:start position:0%
two years in to what is we don't know
 
00:41:29.109 --> 00:41:29.119 align:start position:0%
what the vaccine is going to do to the
 
00:41:32.790 --> 00:41:32.800 align:start position:0%
unborn baby or if you don't recognize it
 
00:41:35.589 --> 00:41:35.599 align:start position:0%
as a baby then the fetus um we don't
 
00:41:38.550 --> 00:41:38.560 align:start position:0%
know the long-term effects for covid-19
 
00:41:42.309 --> 00:41:42.319 align:start position:0%
and or the vaccine at this point so um I
 
00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:45.880 align:start position:0%
do know that more women have died more
 
00:41:48.790 --> 00:41:48.800 align:start position:0%
pregnant women have died from car
 
00:41:50.990 --> 00:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
accidents and their babies have died
 
00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:55.240 align:start position:0%
from car accidents than they have from
 
00:41:59.030 --> 00:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
covid-19 thank you representative
 
00:42:01.109 --> 00:42:01.119 align:start position:0%
mlan thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
for taking my question just I just
 
00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
wanted to clarify your position a little
 
00:42:07.950 --> 00:42:07.960 align:start position:0%
bit because um are are you in support of
 
00:42:09.630 --> 00:42:09.640 align:start position:0%
the bill or do you think that it goes
 
00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
too far with respect to um removing some
 
00:42:15.510 --> 00:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
of the requirements for ultrasound so
 
00:42:16.870 --> 00:42:16.880 align:start position:0%
just looking to clarify what your
 
00:42:20.069 --> 00:42:20.079 align:start position:0%
position was on the bill I I want to re
 
00:42:22.710 --> 00:42:22.720 align:start position:0%
because I didn't have the bill before
 
00:42:24.829 --> 00:42:24.839 align:start position:0%
the amendment was in so I want to read
 
00:42:28.069 --> 00:42:28.079 align:start position:0%
through it I will um send an email
 
00:42:30.510 --> 00:42:30.520 align:start position:0%
whether or not I I support or oppose I
 
00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
was in a different hearing um but one of
 
00:42:37.630 --> 00:42:37.640 align:start position:0%
the things I want to be clear is that I
 
00:42:42.430 --> 00:42:42.440 align:start position:0%
I I understand that because of R versus
 
00:42:46.470 --> 00:42:46.480 align:start position:0%
Wade and because we have granted women
 
00:42:50.069 --> 00:42:50.079 align:start position:0%
the choice and I'm not going to go there
 
00:42:53.069 --> 00:42:53.079 align:start position:0%
as whether that was right or wrong it's
 
00:42:56.710 --> 00:42:56.720 align:start position:0%
history what I'm saying is is that look
 
00:42:58.910 --> 00:42:58.920 align:start position:0%
at what we did with prohibition that
 
00:43:02.430 --> 00:43:02.440 align:start position:0%
didn't work so becoming so making
 
00:43:05.790 --> 00:43:05.800 align:start position:0%
abortion completely a legal in our state
 
00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
may not be the way to go because then
 
00:43:10.589 --> 00:43:10.599 align:start position:0%
again we're putting women in position
 
00:43:12.190 --> 00:43:12.200 align:start position:0%
that they're still going to do it
 
00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:14.240 align:start position:0%
they're just going to have to do it
 
00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
without appropriate oversight and Care
 
00:43:19.390 --> 00:43:19.400 align:start position:0%
um personally what I would like to see
 
00:43:22.710 --> 00:43:22.720 align:start position:0%
is I would like to see uh a lot more a
 
00:43:26.349 --> 00:43:26.359 align:start position:0%
lot more reporting with regards to um
 
00:43:29.670 --> 00:43:29.680 align:start position:0%
the respon on the responsibility of the
 
00:43:31.950 --> 00:43:31.960 align:start position:0%
uh agencies that are performing these
 
00:43:36.069 --> 00:43:36.079 align:start position:0%
abortions and that uh having an
 
00:43:40.510 --> 00:43:40.520 align:start position:0%
ultrasound involved would would help to
 
00:43:42.630 --> 00:43:42.640 align:start position:0%
start making those numbers come a little
 
00:43:44.870 --> 00:43:44.880 align:start position:0%
more to light in the state of New
 
00:43:47.309 --> 00:43:47.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you thank you for your
 
00:43:47.319 --> 00:43:48.750 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you thank you for your
testimony

00:43:48.750 --> 00:43:48.760 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
00:43:55.069 --> 00:43:55.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:55.079 --> 00:43:58.829 align:start position:0%
 
hole

00:43:58.829 --> 00:43:58.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:01.069 --> 00:44:01.079 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman can everybody hear
 
00:44:05.030 --> 00:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
me good so I'm going to start by reading
 
00:44:05.950 --> 00:44:05.960 align:start position:0%
from our
 
00:44:09.589 --> 00:44:09.599 align:start position:0%
constitution because as best I can tell
 
00:44:12.309 --> 00:44:12.319 align:start position:0%
there's no carve outs regarding the age
 
00:44:15.510 --> 00:44:15.520 align:start position:0%
of the person part first article two all
 
00:44:17.549 --> 00:44:17.559 align:start position:0%
men have natural certain sorry all men
 
00:44:19.109 --> 00:44:19.119 align:start position:0%
have certain natural essential and
 
00:44:20.870 --> 00:44:20.880 align:start position:0%
inherent rights among them which are
 
00:44:23.109 --> 00:44:23.119 align:start position:0%
enjoying and defending life and Liberty
 
00:44:24.870 --> 00:44:24.880 align:start position:0%
acquiring possess and possessing and
 
00:44:26.710 --> 00:44:26.720 align:start position:0%
protecting property and in a word
 
00:44:29.790 --> 00:44:29.800 align:start position:0%
seeking and obtaining
 
00:44:32.390 --> 00:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
happiness our constitution is is an
 
00:44:34.549 --> 00:44:34.559 align:start position:0%
incredible document crafted by some
 
00:44:34.559 --> 00:44:37.349 align:start position:0%
incredible document crafted by some
brilliant

00:44:37.349 --> 00:44:37.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:39.589 --> 00:44:39.599 align:start position:0%
men those men would be turning over in
 
00:44:41.710 --> 00:44:41.720 align:start position:0%
their graves today if they saw what was
 
00:44:44.510 --> 00:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
going on both with our country as well
 
00:44:48.190 --> 00:44:48.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:50.829 --> 00:44:50.839 align:start position:0%
abortion I haven't run into anybody so
 
00:44:53.790 --> 00:44:53.800 align:start position:0%
far who had a child who wished that they
 
00:44:56.710 --> 00:44:56.720 align:start position:0%
had aborted the child
 
00:44:58.790 --> 00:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
I have run into some women though who
 
00:45:01.950 --> 00:45:01.960 align:start position:0%
had an abortion who subsequently said I
 
00:45:04.309 --> 00:45:04.319 align:start position:0%
didn't make a good choice I wish I knew
 
00:45:06.470 --> 00:45:06.480 align:start position:0%
now what I knew I wish I knew then what
 
00:45:08.349 --> 00:45:08.359 align:start position:0%
I know
 
00:45:11.309 --> 00:45:11.319 align:start position:0%
now the bill is is a step in the right
 
00:45:13.430 --> 00:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
direction I think it needs to go a lot
 
00:45:15.230 --> 00:45:15.240 align:start position:0%
further but it's at least a part in

not at six months I would draw the line
 
00:45:21.910 --> 00:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
a lot further back but at least it
 
00:45:24.670 --> 00:45:24.680 align:start position:0%
changes the status from where we are
 
00:45:27.670 --> 00:45:27.680 align:start position:0%
today to to a state that doesn't allow

01:36:39.030 --> 01:36:39.040 align:start position:0%
of eyes and ears the fact that this
 
01:36:42.070 --> 01:36:42.080 align:start position:0%
transfer on death deed Bill originated
 
01:36:44.750 --> 01:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
in both houses of our state legislature
 
01:36:47.310 --> 01:36:47.320 align:start position:0%
is a strong indicator that the people of
 
01:36:49.470 --> 01:36:49.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire want and need
 
01:36:52.709 --> 01:36:52.719 align:start position:0%
this hb1 24 the bill you heard in
 
01:36:55.149 --> 01:36:55.159 align:start position:0%
November was referred to interm study
 
01:36:56.870 --> 01:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
and I will address the concerns that
 
01:36:58.950 --> 01:36:58.960 align:start position:0%
arose with regard to that bill later in
 
01:36:58.960 --> 01:36:59.830 align:start position:0%
arose with regard to that bill later in
my

01:36:59.830 --> 01:36:59.840 align:start position:0%
my
 
01:37:02.470 --> 01:37:02.480 align:start position:0%
testimony a transfer on death deed is a
 
01:37:05.709 --> 01:37:05.719 align:start position:0%
simple inexpensive estate planning tool
 
01:37:08.629 --> 01:37:08.639 align:start position:0%
not currently available in New Hampshire
 
01:37:11.350 --> 01:37:11.360 align:start position:0%
it should be noted that 31 states allow
 
01:37:13.950 --> 01:37:13.960 align:start position:0%
this and I feel it should be allowed
 
01:37:17.189 --> 01:37:17.199 align:start position:0%
here I am a single person whose Main and
 
01:37:20.030 --> 01:37:20.040 align:start position:0%
basically only asset is my
 
01:37:22.910 --> 01:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
home I I have a very small estate other
 
01:37:25.990 --> 01:37:26.000 align:start position:0%
than my home I want to avoid the very
 
01:37:29.229 --> 01:37:29.239 align:start position:0%
public timec consuming and expensive
 
01:37:31.790 --> 01:37:31.800 align:start position:0%
probate process I'm not trying to avoid
 
01:37:34.390 --> 01:37:34.400 align:start position:0%
taxes I'm not trying to avoid creditors
 
01:37:36.790 --> 01:37:36.800 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to avoid the very expensive
 
01:37:40.189 --> 01:37:40.199 align:start position:0%
and public probate process the transfer
 
01:37:43.310 --> 01:37:43.320 align:start position:0%
on death D that SB 243 that you have
 
01:37:45.990 --> 01:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
before you now would allow when past
 
01:37:48.390 --> 01:37:48.400 align:start position:0%
would resolve this issue for me and for
 
01:37:51.270 --> 01:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
many others in New Hampshire it will
 
01:37:53.350 --> 01:37:53.360 align:start position:0%
allow me to avoid probate without
 
01:37:56.070 --> 01:37:56.080 align:start position:0%
incurring legal bills or setting up a
 
01:37:58.790 --> 01:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
trust which can be a very expensive
 
01:38:02.270 --> 01:38:02.280 align:start position:0%
process a transfer on death deed is
 
01:38:05.589 --> 01:38:05.599 align:start position:0%
easy and importantly inexpensive to set
 
01:38:07.990 --> 01:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
up and it is revocable or
 
01:38:12.669 --> 01:38:12.679 align:start position:0%
changeable also without Ono expense also
 
01:38:14.629 --> 01:38:14.639 align:start position:0%
important I will now address the
 
01:38:16.470 --> 01:38:16.480 align:start position:0%
concerns raised by this committee which
 
01:38:18.470 --> 01:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
were brought up in
 
01:38:21.149 --> 01:38:21.159 align:start position:0%
hb24 the summary report of your Comm
 
01:38:23.070 --> 01:38:23.080 align:start position:0%
Committee Member represent
 
01:38:25.109 --> 01:38:25.119 align:start position:0%
representative Troy mnz if I'm
 
01:38:27.990 --> 01:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
pronouncing that correctly mner stated
 
01:38:29.830 --> 01:38:29.840 align:start position:0%
that the bill was referred for further
 
01:38:32.229 --> 01:38:32.239 align:start position:0%
study due to unknown effects on the
 
01:38:35.390 --> 01:38:35.400 align:start position:0%
following three things unknown effect
 
01:38:38.270 --> 01:38:38.280 align:start position:0%
for banks holding mortgages there is no
 
01:38:40.310 --> 01:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
effect on banks holding mortgages
 
01:38:42.390 --> 01:38:42.400 align:start position:0%
transfer on death deed does not avoid
 
01:38:44.589 --> 01:38:44.599 align:start position:0%
leans it does not avoid creditors it
 
01:38:46.550 --> 01:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't do away with any mortgages
 
01:38:48.189 --> 01:38:48.199 align:start position:0%
there's no
 
01:38:51.070 --> 01:38:51.080 align:start position:0%
effect another concern was a p proed
 
01:38:53.550 --> 01:38:53.560 align:start position:0%
procedures at the registry of deeds also
 
01:38:55.790 --> 01:38:55.800 align:start position:0%
no effect it's no different than
 
01:38:58.750 --> 01:38:58.760 align:start position:0%
changing a deed for a person's house to
 
01:39:01.629 --> 01:39:01.639 align:start position:0%
a trust retitling the deed for the trust
 
01:39:03.709 --> 01:39:03.719 align:start position:0%
retitling the deed for joint with writer
 
01:39:05.390 --> 01:39:05.400 align:start position:0%
survivorship it's no different it's just
 
01:39:09.270 --> 01:39:09.280 align:start position:0%
recording a deed very simple um the
 
01:39:11.990 --> 01:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
other concern was effect on estate pl's
 
01:39:14.270 --> 01:39:14.280 align:start position:0%
future and current well yes it would
 
01:39:16.310 --> 01:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
have an effect on future estate plans
 
01:39:17.669 --> 01:39:17.679 align:start position:0%
because now there would be another
 
01:39:19.350 --> 01:39:19.360 align:start position:0%
option available to New Hampshire
 
01:39:21.750 --> 01:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
residents and an inexpensive one
 
01:39:24.709 --> 01:39:24.719 align:start position:0%
as far as affecting current estate plans
 
01:39:27.149 --> 01:39:27.159 align:start position:0%
I suppose someone who has already paid
 
01:39:30.310 --> 01:39:30.320 align:start position:0%
to set up a trust would have the option
 
01:39:31.790 --> 01:39:31.800 align:start position:0%
of doing this I don't know why they
 
01:39:34.310 --> 01:39:34.320 align:start position:0%
would um I don't think it would have an
 
01:39:36.550 --> 01:39:36.560 align:start position:0%
effect on a current estate plan but if
 
01:39:38.790 --> 01:39:38.800 align:start position:0%
it did it's it's open to someone's
 
01:39:41.030 --> 01:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
choice to make that
 
01:39:44.109 --> 01:39:44.119 align:start position:0%
decision um I'm not a lawyer but I'd
 
01:39:46.870 --> 01:39:46.880 align:start position:0%
like to also emphasize that two of your
 
01:39:49.430 --> 01:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
colleagues who do have legal expertise
 
01:39:52.109 --> 01:39:52.119 align:start position:0%
Senator Perkins qura and representative
 
01:39:54.910 --> 01:39:54.920 align:start position:0%
Barb Griffin are in support of this bill
 
01:39:57.270 --> 01:39:57.280 align:start position:0%
representative Barbara Griffin had Comm
 
01:39:58.750 --> 01:39:58.760 align:start position:0%
communicated with me that she was
 
01:40:00.830 --> 01:40:00.840 align:start position:0%
unfortunately not able to be here today
 
01:40:02.870 --> 01:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
due to chairing her executive session of
 
01:40:05.709 --> 01:40:05.719 align:start position:0%
her own house committee the transfer on
 
01:40:07.870 --> 01:40:07.880 align:start position:0%
death Eed is a useful estate planning
 
01:40:09.790 --> 01:40:09.800 align:start position:0%
tool that should be available to New
 
01:40:11.830 --> 01:40:11.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents and it is needed and
 
01:40:14.510 --> 01:40:14.520 align:start position:0%
supported by same I'm counting on your
 
01:40:16.550 --> 01:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
support of SP
 
01:40:20.189 --> 01:40:20.199 align:start position:0%
243 thank you I will take questions if
 
01:40:23.030 --> 01:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
there are any are there questions for M
 
01:40:25.950 --> 01:40:25.960 align:start position:0%

01:40:28.109 --> 01:40:28.119 align:start position:0%
Chase thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:40:29.430 --> 01:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
for taking my
 
01:40:31.950 --> 01:40:31.960 align:start position:0%
question I'm just looking at this
 
01:40:34.270 --> 01:40:34.280 align:start position:0%
quickly but can you tell me what what
 
01:40:37.870 --> 01:40:37.880 align:start position:0%
would be considered a h smallest state
 
01:40:40.589 --> 01:40:40.599 align:start position:0%
like where would the line be
 
01:40:43.430 --> 01:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
drawn I I don't know that and I'm not a
 
01:40:46.229 --> 01:40:46.239 align:start position:0%
lawyer um but this transr death deed
 
01:40:49.910 --> 01:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
would be available to anyone small or
 
01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:52.390 align:start position:0%
would be available to anyone small or
large

01:40:52.390 --> 01:40:52.400 align:start position:0%
large
 
01:40:52.400 --> 01:40:53.709 align:start position:0%
large
representa

01:40:53.709 --> 01:40:53.719 align:start position:0%
representa
 
01:40:55.709 --> 01:40:55.719 align:start position:0%
mlan thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:40:58.310 --> 01:40:58.320 align:start position:0%
for taking my question with respect to
 
01:41:01.149 --> 01:41:01.159 align:start position:0%
uh the banks holding mortgages in the
 
01:41:04.270 --> 01:41:04.280 align:start position:0%
other 31 states where this legislation
 
01:41:07.750 --> 01:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
has been enacted um if property the deed
 
01:41:09.510 --> 01:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
is transferred is the mortgage just
 
01:41:11.510 --> 01:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
transferred as well or what's the
 
01:41:12.950 --> 01:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
mechanism yes the mortgage is not
 
01:41:14.830 --> 01:41:14.840 align:start position:0%
discharged everything just stays the
 
01:41:16.790 --> 01:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
same you know the the simplest way to
 
01:41:18.669 --> 01:41:18.679 align:start position:0%
think about a transfer on death deed is
 
01:41:20.910 --> 01:41:20.920 align:start position:0%
sort of like a joint with writer
 
01:41:23.350 --> 01:41:23.360 align:start position:0%
survivorship title where you know if I
 
01:41:25.270 --> 01:41:25.280 align:start position:0%
had a spouse and the deed would be
 
01:41:27.470 --> 01:41:27.480 align:start position:0%
titled join of with right of Survivor
 
01:41:31.030 --> 01:41:31.040 align:start position:0%
and I passed away my spouse would get be
 
01:41:34.310 --> 01:41:34.320 align:start position:0%
on the deed but with whatever leans
 
01:41:36.030 --> 01:41:36.040 align:start position:0%
mortgages or anything came with the
 
01:41:37.790 --> 01:41:37.800 align:start position:0%
property and the transfer and death deed
 
01:41:41.350 --> 01:41:41.360 align:start position:0%
is is work similarly except it's I would
 
01:41:44.390 --> 01:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
assume primarily for single people but
 
01:41:46.430 --> 01:41:46.440 align:start position:0%
not necessarily because again I'm not a
 
01:41:48.709 --> 01:41:48.719 align:start position:0%
lawyer it's just another tool in the
 
01:41:50.550 --> 01:41:50.560 align:start position:0%
toolbox that I don't see any reason why
 
01:41:52.870 --> 01:41:52.880 align:start position:0%
I New Hampshire doesn't have it and I I
 
01:41:55.229 --> 01:41:55.239 align:start position:0%
did email the committee when this first
 
01:41:57.229 --> 01:41:57.239 align:start position:0%
came to my attention was in an article
 
01:41:59.470 --> 01:41:59.480 align:start position:0%
in the union leader and I was all over
 
01:42:01.229 --> 01:42:01.239 align:start position:0%
it and I said oh my gosh this is exactly
 
01:42:03.229 --> 01:42:03.239 align:start position:0%
what I need and then come to find out we
 
01:42:05.550 --> 01:42:05.560 align:start position:0%
didn't have it in New Hampshire hence
 
01:42:07.030 --> 01:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
why I'm here I don't know why the union
 
01:42:09.510 --> 01:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
leader ran it without checking first but
 
01:42:12.390 --> 01:42:12.400 align:start position:0%
in any case that's what brought me here
 
01:42:14.070 --> 01:42:14.080 align:start position:0%
but there's there's many other resources
 
01:42:16.669 --> 01:42:16.679 align:start position:0%
I can send to you from you know the uh
 
01:42:18.790 --> 01:42:18.800 align:start position:0%
different legal sites and so
 
01:42:21.950 --> 01:42:21.960 align:start position:0%
forth other other questions
 
01:42:23.189 --> 01:42:23.199 align:start position:0%
from Miss
 
01:42:25.229 --> 01:42:25.239 align:start position:0%
schul thank you seeing none thank you
 
01:42:26.790 --> 01:42:26.800 align:start position:0%
for your testimony
 
01:42:49.750 --> 01:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:49.760 --> 01:42:57.189 align:start position:0%
 
kraan

01:42:57.189 --> 01:42:57.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:59.310 --> 01:42:59.320 align:start position:0%
chairman and members of the committee my
 
01:43:02.310 --> 01:43:02.320 align:start position:0%
name is Susan craigan I am the register
 
01:43:05.669 --> 01:43:05.679 align:start position:0%
of deeds for marrat County New Hampshire
 
01:43:08.629 --> 01:43:08.639 align:start position:0%
uh but I am testifying right now on my
 
01:43:12.589 --> 01:43:12.599 align:start position:0%
own behalf and the reason for that is
 
01:43:15.390 --> 01:43:15.400 align:start position:0%
that um the
 
01:43:18.629 --> 01:43:18.639 align:start position:0%
bill the registry of deeds doesn't think
 
01:43:21.589 --> 01:43:21.599 align:start position:0%
that the bill affects the registry
 
01:43:26.950 --> 01:43:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:30.430 --> 01:43:30.440 align:start position:0%
um something that the Registries as a
 
01:43:33.910 --> 01:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
whole should test should testify about
 
01:43:36.870 --> 01:43:36.880 align:start position:0%
however uh when we were discussing it we
 
01:43:40.470 --> 01:43:40.480 align:start position:0%
noticed one particular section that we
 
01:43:43.070 --> 01:43:43.080 align:start position:0%
thought might cause problems and that's
 
01:43:45.950 --> 01:43:45.960 align:start position:0%
why I'm testifying in opposition and
 
01:43:51.070 --> 01:43:51.080 align:start position:0%
only to this one section and that is 563
 
01:43:55.310 --> 01:43:55.320 align:start position:0%
d10 notice delivery acceptance and
 
01:43:58.790 --> 01:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
consideration are not
 
01:44:02.510 --> 01:44:02.520 align:start position:0%
required um so what does this
 
01:44:06.830 --> 01:44:06.840 align:start position:0%
mean this means that ownership can be
 
01:44:11.870 --> 01:44:11.880 align:start position:0%
thrust upon perhaps an unwilling
 
01:44:14.589 --> 01:44:14.599 align:start position:0%
recipient and let me tell you a little
 
01:44:17.990 --> 01:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
bit about what happened to me recently
 
01:44:20.350 --> 01:44:20.360 align:start position:0%
and this was just in the context of a
 
01:44:22.870 --> 01:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
will not in the context of this type of
 
01:44:26.350 --> 01:44:26.360 align:start position:0%
deed my husband was bequeathed by will
 
01:44:28.470 --> 01:44:28.480 align:start position:0%
one quarter of a house when his mother
 
01:44:31.950 --> 01:44:31.960 align:start position:0%
died and he immediately disclaimed the
 
01:44:34.350 --> 01:44:34.360 align:start position:0%
gift which he was entitled to do because
 
01:44:36.910 --> 01:44:36.920 align:start position:0%
it was a will and probate why because he
 
01:44:38.589 --> 01:44:38.599 align:start position:0%
didn't want the property and there were
 
01:44:40.030 --> 01:44:40.040 align:start position:0%
good reasons for
 
01:44:43.229 --> 01:44:43.239 align:start position:0%
it there were environmental hazards that
 
01:44:45.830 --> 01:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
my husband had notice of the water
 
01:44:48.270 --> 01:44:48.280 align:start position:0%
wasn't pable there was black mold in the
 
01:44:50.990 --> 01:44:51.000 align:start position:0%
basement decades old fur treat grew
 
01:44:52.830 --> 01:44:52.840 align:start position:0%
within a couple of feet of the house one
 
01:44:54.750 --> 01:44:54.760 align:start position:0%
of which could crush the tiny house in
 
01:44:57.270 --> 01:44:57.280 align:start position:0%
the right wind the wood pile had been
 
01:44:58.990 --> 01:44:59.000 align:start position:0%
kept too close to the house and there
 
01:45:00.790 --> 01:45:00.800 align:start position:0%
was bug
 
01:45:03.470 --> 01:45:03.480 align:start position:0%
infestation two there were obligations
 
01:45:05.709 --> 01:45:05.719 align:start position:0%
that ran with the land that he didn't
 
01:45:07.669 --> 01:45:07.679 align:start position:0%
want to take on including partial
 
01:45:09.470 --> 01:45:09.480 align:start position:0%
responsibility for keeping a water
 
01:45:12.910 --> 01:45:12.920 align:start position:0%
course clear three he thought a creditor
 
01:45:15.950 --> 01:45:15.960 align:start position:0%
lean might exceed the real value of the
 
01:45:18.629 --> 01:45:18.639 align:start position:0%
property he had cash that the bank could
 
01:45:21.070 --> 01:45:21.080 align:start position:0%
go after in a deficiency judge
 
01:45:24.990 --> 01:45:25.000 align:start position:0%
ment four ownership would be partial
 
01:45:27.990 --> 01:45:28.000 align:start position:0%
among four siblings three of whom wanted
 
01:45:29.950 --> 01:45:29.960 align:start position:0%
to keep the house for sentimental
 
01:45:32.830 --> 01:45:32.840 align:start position:0%
reasons one of these we suspected was
 
01:45:35.350 --> 01:45:35.360 align:start position:0%
insolvent and knew was irresponsible
 
01:45:37.950 --> 01:45:37.960 align:start position:0%
with money and a second mentioned using
 
01:45:40.669 --> 01:45:40.679 align:start position:0%
it as a weekend retreat for a religious
 
01:45:42.070 --> 01:45:42.080 align:start position:0%
group we
 
01:45:44.950 --> 01:45:44.960 align:start position:0%
disliked and those were the two siblings
 
01:45:47.310 --> 01:45:47.320 align:start position:0%
he got along
 
01:45:50.470 --> 01:45:50.480 align:start position:0%
with if my husband had not disclaimed
 
01:45:52.589 --> 01:45:52.599 align:start position:0%
claimed under the will he would have had
 
01:45:54.750 --> 01:45:54.760 align:start position:0%
to take time to go to New York State get
 
01:45:57.629 --> 01:45:57.639 align:start position:0%
a lawyer to arrange the transfer with
 
01:45:59.629 --> 01:45:59.639 align:start position:0%
expenses and
 
01:45:59.639 --> 01:46:01.430 align:start position:0%
expenses and
headaches

01:46:01.430 --> 01:46:01.440 align:start position:0%
headaches
 
01:46:04.629 --> 01:46:04.639 align:start position:0%
um the American Association of retired
 
01:46:07.910 --> 01:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
persons thinks there are good reasons to
 
01:46:11.790 --> 01:46:11.800 align:start position:0%
decline a bequest of real property it's
 
01:46:14.750 --> 01:46:14.760 align:start position:0%
a good tax move for instance if the
 
01:46:17.109 --> 01:46:17.119 align:start position:0%
property would then go to your child who
 
01:46:20.870 --> 01:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
has a lower tax consequence it's a dog a
 
01:46:25.629 --> 01:46:25.639 align:start position:0%
property property taxes can eat up um
 
01:46:29.229 --> 01:46:29.239 align:start position:0%
unpaid property taxes environmental risk
 
01:46:30.430 --> 01:46:30.440 align:start position:0%
and other
 
01:46:32.910 --> 01:46:32.920 align:start position:0%
reasons three it will trigger a
 
01:46:35.669 --> 01:46:35.679 align:start position:0%
government Aid eligibility
 
01:46:38.390 --> 01:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
review uh for instance in medic for
 
01:46:41.109 --> 01:46:41.119 align:start position:0%
Medicaid you can't have more than $2,000
 
01:46:45.149 --> 01:46:45.159 align:start position:0%
in assets suppose you give this property
 
01:46:47.870 --> 01:46:47.880 align:start position:0%
to my mother who's in a nursing home and
 
01:46:50.669 --> 01:46:50.679 align:start position:0%
who Medicaid is paying for but if she
 
01:46:55.070 --> 01:46:55.080 align:start position:0%
has more than $2,000 of assets they will
 
01:46:55.080 --> 01:46:56.709 align:start position:0%
has more than $2,000 of assets they will
stop

01:46:56.709 --> 01:46:56.719 align:start position:0%
stop
 
01:47:01.390 --> 01:47:01.400 align:start position:0%
um four it will trigger a family drama
 
01:47:04.229 --> 01:47:04.239 align:start position:0%
and this is important in New Hampshire
 
01:47:05.750 --> 01:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
because a lot of these properties are
 
01:47:08.990 --> 01:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
likely to be summer cottages things with
 
01:47:11.310 --> 01:47:11.320 align:start position:0%
memories five it will go to your
 
01:47:13.669 --> 01:47:13.679 align:start position:0%
creditors are you on the brink of
 
01:47:16.070 --> 01:47:16.080 align:start position:0%
bankruptcy do you really care if you get
 
01:47:17.669 --> 01:47:17.679 align:start position:0%
one more small
 
01:47:21.910 --> 01:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
asset and six it's the right thing to
 
01:47:25.669 --> 01:47:25.679 align:start position:0%
do now suppose that in addition to all
 
01:47:27.990 --> 01:47:28.000 align:start position:0%
this the beneficiary does not get notice
 
01:47:30.910 --> 01:47:30.920 align:start position:0%
of the death of or of the transfer
 
01:47:34.390 --> 01:47:34.400 align:start position:0%
property to himself right away suppose
 
01:47:37.750 --> 01:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
before I die suppose it's me doing it I
 
01:47:40.350 --> 01:47:40.360 align:start position:0%
execute a transfer on death Deed on a
 
01:47:43.589 --> 01:47:43.599 align:start position:0%
toxic dump to a person I don't know but
 
01:47:46.750 --> 01:47:46.760 align:start position:0%
despise or who's difficult to locate
 
01:47:48.350 --> 01:47:48.360 align:start position:0%
what happens
 
01:47:51.350 --> 01:47:51.360 align:start position:0%
then um
 
01:47:53.709 --> 01:47:53.719 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure that towns always want to
 
01:47:58.910 --> 01:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:02.950 --> 01:48:02.960 align:start position:0%
bills that's one major problem with this
 
01:48:05.430 --> 01:48:05.440 align:start position:0%
bill that there's no notice and there's
 
01:48:05.440 --> 01:48:06.910 align:start position:0%
bill that there's no notice and there's
no

01:48:06.910 --> 01:48:06.920 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:48:11.669 --> 01:48:11.679 align:start position:0%
acceptance um and it becomes a big
 
01:48:15.390 --> 01:48:15.400 align:start position:0%
problem for the recipients
 
01:48:18.709 --> 01:48:18.719 align:start position:0%
sometimes and for their for that reason
 
01:48:21.310 --> 01:48:21.320 align:start position:0%
and that reason alone
 
01:48:23.950 --> 01:48:23.960 align:start position:0%
I am testifying in opposition for this
 
01:48:26.629 --> 01:48:26.639 align:start position:0%
to this bill as written I think that
 
01:48:29.790 --> 01:48:29.800 align:start position:0%
there should be a requirement for notice
 
01:48:34.149 --> 01:48:34.159 align:start position:0%
and acceptance on the deed
 
01:48:36.750 --> 01:48:36.760 align:start position:0%
itself any
 
01:48:39.990 --> 01:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
questions are there questions for Miss
 
01:48:43.550 --> 01:48:43.560 align:start position:0%
craigan yes representative Simpson thank
 
01:48:45.270 --> 01:48:45.280 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:48:47.669 --> 01:48:47.679 align:start position:0%
question I'm going to pref preface this
 
01:48:49.870 --> 01:48:49.880 align:start position:0%
with that I am not oh sorry I'm going to
 
01:48:53.750 --> 01:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
take the off um I am not a lawyer so I
 
01:48:56.149 --> 01:48:56.159 align:start position:0%
everybody else might understand this but
 
01:48:58.310 --> 01:48:58.320 align:start position:0%
so when it says notice or delivery
 
01:49:00.830 --> 01:49:00.840 align:start position:0%
without notice or delivery to or
 
01:49:03.870 --> 01:49:03.880 align:start position:0%
acceptance by the designated beneficiary
 
01:49:06.870 --> 01:49:06.880 align:start position:0%
during the transfer's life does that
 
01:49:10.350 --> 01:49:10.360 align:start position:0%
mean that the person who has deeded
 
01:49:15.430 --> 01:49:15.440 align:start position:0%
the land uh can decline the transfer
 
01:49:19.109 --> 01:49:19.119 align:start position:0%
after the transfer has died
 
01:49:21.550 --> 01:49:21.560 align:start position:0%
or oh will you go to the microphone
 
01:49:23.510 --> 01:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
because I other people may have the same
 
01:49:26.430 --> 01:49:26.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:31.109 --> 01:49:31.119 align:start position:0%
not see that's the problem there is a
 
01:49:34.950 --> 01:49:34.960 align:start position:0%
period where property ownership is
 
01:49:39.149 --> 01:49:39.159 align:start position:0%
ambiguous and I think that ambigu
 
01:49:41.790 --> 01:49:41.800 align:start position:0%
ambiguity is not a good
 
01:49:44.030 --> 01:49:44.040 align:start position:0%
thing um
 
01:49:44.040 --> 01:49:46.550 align:start position:0%
thing um
so

01:49:46.550 --> 01:49:46.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:49:49.109 --> 01:49:49.119 align:start position:0%
your you don't need
 
01:49:49.119 --> 01:49:52.030 align:start position:0%
your you don't need
owners

01:49:52.030 --> 01:49:52.040 align:start position:0%
owners
 
01:49:54.310 --> 01:49:54.320 align:start position:0%
here's the problem no matter how
 
01:49:57.310 --> 01:49:57.320 align:start position:0%
small that transfer period is there's
 
01:50:01.149 --> 01:50:01.159 align:start position:0%
still a there's still a a a Time point
 
01:50:03.830 --> 01:50:03.840 align:start position:0%
in time where the ownership of the land
 
01:50:09.270 --> 01:50:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:13.189 --> 01:50:13.199 align:start position:0%
unknown so let's say
 
01:50:16.149 --> 01:50:16.159 align:start position:0%
um let's say my neighbor across the
 
01:50:18.669 --> 01:50:18.679 align:start position:0%
street Wills me her
 
01:50:23.510 --> 01:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
house um after having um and then leaves
 
01:50:25.910 --> 01:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
me a letter saying that she hopes that
 
01:50:27.790 --> 01:50:27.800 align:start position:0%
I'll take care of her son or something
 
01:50:32.310 --> 01:50:32.320 align:start position:0%
like that um if I get the
 
01:50:34.510 --> 01:50:34.520 align:start position:0%
property no that's a bad actually that's
 
01:50:40.069 --> 01:50:40.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:40.079 --> 01:50:42.030 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:50:42.030 --> 01:50:42.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:45.990 --> 01:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
you if I there's no provision in there
 
01:50:49.350 --> 01:50:49.360 align:start position:0%
that requires notice to be given to me
 
01:50:53.390 --> 01:50:53.400 align:start position:0%
and then requires me to accept it okay
 
01:50:55.589 --> 01:50:55.599 align:start position:0%
now if
 
01:50:58.709 --> 01:50:58.719 align:start position:0%
apparently there's a the possibility
 
01:51:01.149 --> 01:51:01.159 align:start position:0%
that I can turn it down at some point in
 
01:51:05.109 --> 01:51:05.119 align:start position:0%
the future once I get notice of the
 
01:51:07.870 --> 01:51:07.880 align:start position:0%
transfer but suppose I don't get notice
 
01:51:11.350 --> 01:51:11.360 align:start position:0%
right away how long does that happen how
 
01:51:14.390 --> 01:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
long does that take and let's suppose
 
01:51:17.149 --> 01:51:17.159 align:start position:0%
that I start telling people that I just
 
01:51:19.470 --> 01:51:19.480 align:start position:0%
got notice after I found out there's
 
01:51:21.990 --> 01:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
toxic waste on there then it becomes a
 
01:51:25.030 --> 01:51:25.040 align:start position:0%
question of fact for the court probably
 
01:51:27.669 --> 01:51:27.679 align:start position:0%
but it could lead to messy litigation
 
01:51:29.430 --> 01:51:29.440 align:start position:0%
and what I'm saying is that this bill
 
01:51:32.750 --> 01:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
could be made dramatically better by the
 
01:51:36.189 --> 01:51:36.199 align:start position:0%
addition of a notice requirement and a
 
01:51:39.910 --> 01:51:39.920 align:start position:0%
and a line on that deed that says that
 
01:51:43.550 --> 01:51:43.560 align:start position:0%
the recipient agrees to the
 
01:51:46.149 --> 01:51:46.159 align:start position:0%
transfer and I don't think that's a big
 
01:51:48.950 --> 01:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:48.960 --> 01:51:50.470 align:start position:0%
 
ask

01:51:50.470 --> 01:51:50.480 align:start position:0%
ask
 
01:51:53.109 --> 01:51:53.119 align:start position:0%
and the other thing is too I I
 
01:51:54.950 --> 01:51:54.960 align:start position:0%
complained about this bill to the
 
01:51:58.350 --> 01:51:58.360 align:start position:0%
uniform law commission which drafted
 
01:52:01.069 --> 01:52:01.079 align:start position:0%
it and I got a letter back from the
 
01:52:01.079 --> 01:52:02.270 align:start position:0%
it and I got a letter back from the
draft

01:52:02.270 --> 01:52:02.280 align:start position:0%
draft
 
01:52:04.790 --> 01:52:04.800 align:start position:0%
door that
 
01:52:10.069 --> 01:52:10.079 align:start position:0%
was um that didn't address the point he
 
01:52:13.990 --> 01:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
didn't understand
 
01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:15.950 align:start position:0%
didn't understand
why

01:52:15.950 --> 01:52:15.960 align:start position:0%
why
 
01:52:20.390 --> 01:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
um definite ownership of property
 
01:52:24.990 --> 01:52:25.000 align:start position:0%
is is a an important thing and can be a
 
01:52:28.390 --> 01:52:28.400 align:start position:0%
problem and I don't think also I mean I
 
01:52:30.229 --> 01:52:30.239 align:start position:0%
think everybody's taking it from the
 
01:52:33.310 --> 01:52:33.320 align:start position:0%
point of view of the person who has the
 
01:52:37.109 --> 01:52:37.119 align:start position:0%
estate the person who wants to give away
 
01:52:40.910 --> 01:52:40.920 align:start position:0%
um their small landh holding to a
 
01:52:44.109 --> 01:52:44.119 align:start position:0%
descendant and that's a fine thing to do
 
01:52:47.750 --> 01:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
I have no problem with that at all um
 
01:52:49.950 --> 01:52:49.960 align:start position:0%
but you have to consider all the
 
01:52:51.990 --> 01:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
ramifications of this
 
01:52:55.390 --> 01:52:55.400 align:start position:0%
bill okay are there other questions
 
01:52:55.400 --> 01:52:56.669 align:start position:0%
bill okay are there other questions
representative

01:52:56.669 --> 01:52:56.679 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:52:58.950 --> 01:52:58.960 align:start position:0%
Chase thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
01:53:01.830 --> 01:53:01.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm just again I'm
 
01:53:03.910 --> 01:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
not a lawyer either and I want to try to
 
01:53:06.550 --> 01:53:06.560 align:start position:0%
clarify so right now if somebody has a
 
01:53:09.470 --> 01:53:09.480 align:start position:0%
deed on a property
 
01:53:12.870 --> 01:53:12.880 align:start position:0%
um they don't have to write a little
 
01:53:15.069 --> 01:53:15.079 align:start position:0%
note saying this is where I want the
 
01:53:18.589 --> 01:53:18.599 align:start position:0%
property to go so you're that say I
 
01:53:21.270 --> 01:53:21.280 align:start position:0%
passed away and I had left a note in my
 
01:53:23.510 --> 01:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
dresser drawer that my property was to
 
01:53:27.550 --> 01:53:27.560 align:start position:0%
go to my son is that the way things go
 
01:53:30.030 --> 01:53:30.040 align:start position:0%
now I'm just trying to figure out is
 
01:53:31.350 --> 01:53:31.360 align:start position:0%
that what you're talking about with
 
01:53:33.629 --> 01:53:33.639 align:start position:0%
property if it's not on the deed and
 
01:53:36.990 --> 01:53:37.000 align:start position:0%
writing that little bit of a couple of
 
01:53:40.229 --> 01:53:40.239 align:start position:0%
lines you just have to wait until
 
01:53:45.390 --> 01:53:45.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:48.750 --> 01:53:48.760 align:start position:0%
up exactly according to this bill the
 
01:53:51.310 --> 01:53:51.320 align:start position:0%
only paper you need is the deed
 
01:53:54.189 --> 01:53:54.199 align:start position:0%
itself and then you file the deed with
 
01:53:55.430 --> 01:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
the registry of
 
01:53:57.270 --> 01:53:57.280 align:start position:0%
deeds and
 
01:53:59.750 --> 01:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
then that's all you need is that one
 
01:54:01.390 --> 01:54:01.400 align:start position:0%
piece of
 
01:54:06.750 --> 01:54:06.760 align:start position:0%
paper so you know if the piece of paper
 
01:54:10.550 --> 01:54:10.560 align:start position:0%
is lost let's
 
01:54:15.830 --> 01:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
say then who knows um you know how do
 
01:54:18.669 --> 01:54:18.679 align:start position:0%
you find out where that property has
 
01:54:18.679 --> 01:54:22.430 align:start position:0%
you find out where that property has
gone

01:54:22.430 --> 01:54:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:25.390 --> 01:54:25.400 align:start position:0%
other questions representative
 
01:54:27.470 --> 01:54:27.480 align:start position:0%
mlan thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:54:30.229 --> 01:54:30.239 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so um the the
 
01:54:34.910 --> 01:54:34.920 align:start position:0%
bill does allow you to uh disclaim the
 
01:54:38.589 --> 01:54:38.599 align:start position:0%
the benefit but the language on page two
 
01:54:41.790 --> 01:54:41.800 align:start position:0%
does explicitly state that a transfer on
 
01:54:43.550 --> 01:54:43.560 align:start position:0%
death deed is effective without notice
 
01:54:45.750 --> 01:54:45.760 align:start position:0%
or delivery and it's actually not an
 
01:54:48.669 --> 01:54:48.679 align:start position:0%
Omission but it's explicit in here that
 
01:54:50.830 --> 01:54:50.840 align:start position:0%
you do not have to to have um a notice
 
01:54:53.470 --> 01:54:53.480 align:start position:0%
of delivery or acceptance so
 
01:54:55.350 --> 01:54:55.360 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the prime sponsor is not
 
01:54:57.790 --> 01:54:57.800 align:start position:0%
here do you know why that explicit
 
01:55:01.790 --> 01:55:01.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:05.189 --> 01:55:05.199 align:start position:0%
bill I have no idea I have asked the
 
01:55:06.790 --> 01:55:06.800 align:start position:0%
other registries of
 
01:55:12.069 --> 01:55:12.079 align:start position:0%
deeds and um we have no idea it doesn't
 
01:55:15.069 --> 01:55:15.079 align:start position:0%
make any logical sense to me and I think
 
01:55:15.079 --> 01:55:16.069 align:start position:0%
make any logical sense to me and I think
it's

01:55:16.069 --> 01:55:16.079 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:55:16.079 --> 01:55:17.790 align:start position:0%
it's
incorrect

01:55:17.790 --> 01:55:17.800 align:start position:0%
incorrect
 
01:55:21.790 --> 01:55:21.800 align:start position:0%
oh follow up are are you aware in the
 
01:55:24.750 --> 01:55:24.760 align:start position:0%
other 31 states that were referenced if
 
01:55:27.669 --> 01:55:27.679 align:start position:0%
they have other explicit because this
 
01:55:29.709 --> 01:55:29.719 align:start position:0%
it's a very explicit provision you're
 
01:55:32.669 --> 01:55:32.679 align:start position:0%
right that says acceptance
 
01:55:36.430 --> 01:55:36.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't notice or delivery to the or
 
01:55:38.790 --> 01:55:38.800 align:start position:0%
acceptance by the designated beneficiary
 
01:55:42.149 --> 01:55:42.159 align:start position:0%
during the transfer life is not required
 
01:55:44.830 --> 01:55:44.840 align:start position:0%
so it is explicit do you know do the
 
01:55:47.470 --> 01:55:47.480 align:start position:0%
other states have that as well I don't
 
01:55:50.950 --> 01:55:50.960 align:start position:0%
know about the other states um but it is
 
01:55:52.950 --> 01:55:52.960 align:start position:0%
possible that in addition to having
 
01:55:55.870 --> 01:55:55.880 align:start position:0%
passed the bill um there are other
 
01:56:00.470 --> 01:56:00.480 align:start position:0%
requirements somehow um or that the bill
 
01:56:02.990 --> 01:56:03.000 align:start position:0%
has been added on to saying that if the
 
01:56:04.589 --> 01:56:04.599 align:start position:0%
property isn't claimed within a certain
 
01:56:06.790 --> 01:56:06.800 align:start position:0%
amount it reverts back here's the
 
01:56:09.510 --> 01:56:09.520 align:start position:0%
problem with listening to the pro the um
 
01:56:11.390 --> 01:56:11.400 align:start position:0%
uniform law
 
01:56:15.390 --> 01:56:15.400 align:start position:0%
commission if they if you pass their
 
01:56:17.990 --> 01:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
bill they say it's passed whether you
 
01:56:21.669 --> 01:56:21.679 align:start position:0%
edit it or not and I don't know if any
 
01:56:24.709 --> 01:56:24.719 align:start position:0%
of the states have edited it or added on
 
01:56:28.629 --> 01:56:28.639 align:start position:0%
to it or if there's another superseding
 
01:56:32.310 --> 01:56:32.320 align:start position:0%
law that adds requirements to it so I
 
01:56:34.430 --> 01:56:34.440 align:start position:0%
don't know that but I do know that
 
01:56:36.510 --> 01:56:36.520 align:start position:0%
looking at a chart that says that 31
 
01:56:40.990 --> 01:56:41.000 align:start position:0%
States passed the bill um isn't doesn't
 
01:56:42.470 --> 01:56:42.480 align:start position:0%
give you all the information that's
 
01:56:47.030 --> 01:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
number one number two um states have a
 
01:56:50.310 --> 01:56:50.320 align:start position:0%
tendency to pass uniform law commission
 
01:56:52.790 --> 01:56:52.800 align:start position:0%
laws without reading them
 
01:56:55.709 --> 01:56:55.719 align:start position:0%
carefully um
 
01:56:59.750 --> 01:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
and that happened recently with the um
 
01:57:03.510 --> 01:57:03.520 align:start position:0%
online notarization bill and we passed
 
01:57:08.189 --> 01:57:08.199 align:start position:0%
that bill and we thought it was fine um
 
01:57:11.310 --> 01:57:11.320 align:start position:0%
and it's been revised and now the
 
01:57:13.990 --> 01:57:14.000 align:start position:0%
uniform law commission says that the law
 
01:57:15.990 --> 01:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
we just passed isn't good enough and we
 
01:57:18.589 --> 01:57:18.599 align:start position:0%
should re we should pass another one
 
01:57:20.229 --> 01:57:20.239 align:start position:0%
this year
 
01:57:24.750 --> 01:57:24.760 align:start position:0%
so um the uniform law
 
01:57:26.830 --> 01:57:26.840 align:start position:0%
Commissioners have good ideas but
 
01:57:29.270 --> 01:57:29.280 align:start position:0%
they're human and they make
 
01:57:32.310 --> 01:57:32.320 align:start position:0%
mistakes um and they go back and revise
 
01:57:33.229 --> 01:57:33.239 align:start position:0%
their own
 
01:57:38.350 --> 01:57:38.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:40.470 --> 01:57:40.480 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your testimony
 
01:57:43.069 --> 01:57:43.079 align:start position:0%
today you're
 
01:57:48.390 --> 01:57:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:48.400 --> 01:57:52.189 align:start position:0%
 
puck

01:57:52.189 --> 01:57:52.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:55.470 --> 01:57:55.480 align:start position:0%
good morning uh my name is Kelly o Puck
 
01:57:57.390 --> 01:57:57.400 align:start position:0%
I'm a real estate attorney here in
 
01:57:59.990 --> 01:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
conquered I'm testifying in opposition
 
01:58:01.910 --> 01:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
to this bill and I'm testifying on my
 
01:58:04.550 --> 01:58:04.560 align:start position:0%
own behalf I'm not testifying on behalf
 
01:58:06.990 --> 01:58:07.000 align:start position:0%
of anyone else
 
01:58:10.390 --> 01:58:10.400 align:start position:0%
um I think the regist pointed out what
 
01:58:13.149 --> 01:58:13.159 align:start position:0%
the main issue here with this bill is it
 
01:58:16.470 --> 01:58:16.480 align:start position:0%
offers elery Simplicity which can be a
 
01:58:19.790 --> 01:58:19.800 align:start position:0%
very dangerous thing um especially for
 
01:58:21.870 --> 01:58:21.880 align:start position:0%
Lay people who don't may not understand
 
01:58:24.470 --> 01:58:24.480 align:start position:0%
the implications of what they're doing
 
01:58:26.350 --> 01:58:26.360 align:start position:0%
um someone could go out and prepare this
 
01:58:28.629 --> 01:58:28.639 align:start position:0%
deed and have it noiz thinking this is a
 
01:58:31.149 --> 01:58:31.159 align:start position:0%
very simple solution to a problem and
 
01:58:33.870 --> 01:58:33.880 align:start position:0%
not fully understand the ramifications
 
01:58:36.589 --> 01:58:36.599 align:start position:0%
the transfer property is
 
01:58:39.350 --> 01:58:39.360 align:start position:0%
complicated real estate is often the
 
01:58:41.550 --> 01:58:41.560 align:start position:0%
most important the most valuable asset
 
01:58:44.669 --> 01:58:44.679 align:start position:0%
somebody has and it is serious and it
 
01:58:48.030 --> 01:58:48.040 align:start position:0%
can have ramifications that are serious
 
01:58:52.069 --> 01:58:52.079 align:start position:0%
and um so I think we need to understand
 
01:58:54.830 --> 01:58:54.840 align:start position:0%
that while this may look like a simple
 
01:58:57.629 --> 01:58:57.639 align:start position:0%
solution it's not that simple and it may
 
01:58:59.910 --> 01:58:59.920 align:start position:0%
actually create more problems than it
 
01:59:03.149 --> 01:59:03.159 align:start position:0%
solves um one of the main problems has
 
01:59:05.069 --> 01:59:05.079 align:start position:0%
already been discussed and pointed out
 
01:59:08.950 --> 01:59:08.960 align:start position:0%
which is this notice issue so the fact
 
01:59:11.030 --> 01:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
that whoever is the named beneficiary
 
01:59:13.470 --> 01:59:13.480 align:start position:0%
isn't required to accept the deed isn't
 
01:59:16.510 --> 01:59:16.520 align:start position:0%
required to be notified um isn't
 
01:59:19.550 --> 01:59:19.560 align:start position:0%
required to be somebody who is related
 
01:59:24.669 --> 01:59:24.679 align:start position:0%
or alive or you know of age so all of
 
01:59:27.629 --> 01:59:27.639 align:start position:0%
these things create uncertainty create
 
01:59:30.629 --> 01:59:30.639 align:start position:0%
risk um as to the question about
 
01:59:32.790 --> 01:59:32.800 align:start position:0%
disclaimer so there is a disclaimer
 
01:59:35.990 --> 01:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
provision in the proposed statute um it
 
01:59:38.229 --> 01:59:38.239 align:start position:0%
allows the beneficiary to disclaim
 
01:59:42.109 --> 01:59:42.119 align:start position:0%
within 60 days of the transfer's
 
01:59:44.790 --> 01:59:44.800 align:start position:0%
death so the problem with this is what
 
01:59:46.830 --> 01:59:46.840 align:start position:0%
if there's a beneficiary who doesn't
 
01:59:50.149 --> 01:59:50.159 align:start position:0%
know about the transfer death there's no
 
01:59:52.870 --> 01:59:52.880 align:start position:0%
provision in here that requires any
 
01:59:55.910 --> 01:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
notice to the registry to the town of
 
01:59:58.990 --> 01:59:59.000 align:start position:0%
the transfer death so we do have this
 
01:59:59.000 --> 01:59:59.990 align:start position:0%
the transfer death so we do have this
huge

01:59:59.990 --> 02:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
huge
 
02:00:03.149 --> 02:00:03.159 align:start position:0%
uncertainty that's built in when
 
02:00:04.910 --> 02:00:04.920 align:start position:0%
somebody passes away and they've
 
02:00:08.830 --> 02:00:08.840 align:start position:0%
executed one of these deeds and
 
02:00:12.189 --> 02:00:12.199 align:start position:0%
frankly I think it creates a burden on
 
02:00:12.199 --> 02:00:13.310 align:start position:0%
frankly I think it creates a burden on
the

02:00:13.310 --> 02:00:13.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:00:16.390 --> 02:00:16.400 align:start position:0%
registers and on the towns to try and
 
02:00:19.390 --> 02:00:19.400 align:start position:0%
figure out who these beneficiaries are
 
02:00:22.149 --> 02:00:22.159 align:start position:0%
where they are located if they're still
 
02:00:25.390 --> 02:00:25.400 align:start position:0%
alive if they're not alive what happens
 
02:00:28.069 --> 02:00:28.079 align:start position:0%
um we do have appropriate process for a
 
02:00:30.550 --> 02:00:30.560 align:start position:0%
reason it provides order it provides
 
02:00:33.830 --> 02:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
notice we have rules um and it provides
 
02:00:36.589 --> 02:00:36.599 align:start position:0%
opportunity for people to understand the
 
02:00:39.229 --> 02:00:39.239 align:start position:0%
process and have the process of transfer
 
02:00:41.350 --> 02:00:41.360 align:start position:0%
of property which is very important and
 
02:00:44.030 --> 02:00:44.040 align:start position:0%
serious um be taken
 
02:00:46.229 --> 02:00:46.239 align:start position:0%
seriously in addition I'd like to point
 
02:00:49.270 --> 02:00:49.280 align:start position:0%
out we already do have a process to to
 
02:00:52.229 --> 02:00:52.239 align:start position:0%
transfer property without going through
 
02:00:54.069 --> 02:00:54.079 align:start position:0%
probate and it's through the creation of
 
02:00:58.310 --> 02:00:58.320 align:start position:0%
a trust um which often does require
 
02:00:59.910 --> 02:00:59.920 align:start position:0%
going to an attorney and getting advice
 
02:01:01.830 --> 02:01:01.840 align:start position:0%
of counsel but that's appropriate and it
 
02:01:03.589 --> 02:01:03.599 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to be super
 
02:01:06.550 --> 02:01:06.560 align:start position:0%
expensive um I think there there are
 
02:01:07.750 --> 02:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
some other attorneys who will be
 
02:01:09.589 --> 02:01:09.599 align:start position:0%
testifying a little bit more about that
 
02:01:11.830 --> 02:01:11.840 align:start position:0%
I'm I kind of practice on the real
 
02:01:13.629 --> 02:01:13.639 align:start position:0%
estate side of things so I'm more
 
02:01:16.229 --> 02:01:16.239 align:start position:0%
focused on how it affects title how it
 
02:01:18.270 --> 02:01:18.280 align:start position:0%
might affect creditors another thing
 
02:01:21.149 --> 02:01:21.159 align:start position:0%
that I want to point out about um the
 
02:01:23.510 --> 02:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
uncertainty and the risk with title of
 
02:01:25.629 --> 02:01:25.639 align:start position:0%
not knowing what the status of title is
 
02:01:27.830 --> 02:01:27.840 align:start position:0%
and who the owner is is that there's a
 
02:01:31.550 --> 02:01:31.560 align:start position:0%
there's an 18month period in the statute
 
02:01:33.830 --> 02:01:33.840 align:start position:0%
that the property will still be subject
 
02:01:36.950 --> 02:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
to claims of the state so that means
 
02:01:39.790 --> 02:01:39.800 align:start position:0%
there's an 18month period where we don't
 
02:01:42.910 --> 02:01:42.920 align:start position:0%
know for sure is this property going to
 
02:01:45.950 --> 02:01:45.960 align:start position:0%
be subject to these claims that makes it
 
02:01:49.589 --> 02:01:49.599 align:start position:0%
very likely that whoever is the
 
02:01:51.390 --> 02:01:51.400 align:start position:0%
beneficiary is not going to be able to
 
02:01:53.069 --> 02:01:53.079 align:start position:0%
do anything with this property during
 
02:01:55.270 --> 02:01:55.280 align:start position:0%
that 18-month period without opening a
 
02:01:55.280 --> 02:01:56.310 align:start position:0%
that 18-month period without opening a
probate

02:01:56.310 --> 02:01:56.320 align:start position:0%
probate
 
02:01:59.390 --> 02:01:59.400 align:start position:0%
anyway so um it's unlikely that any
 
02:02:01.149 --> 02:02:01.159 align:start position:0%
lender is going to lend money that's
 
02:02:03.109 --> 02:02:03.119 align:start position:0%
secured by that property it's unlikely
 
02:02:05.709 --> 02:02:05.719 align:start position:0%
that any title insurer is going to Ure
 
02:02:07.510 --> 02:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
title to that property during that
 
02:02:09.430 --> 02:02:09.440 align:start position:0%
period and then we have this whole
 
02:02:12.350 --> 02:02:12.360 align:start position:0%
period where um that beneficiary could
 
02:02:15.109 --> 02:02:15.119 align:start position:0%
go out and transfer the property and
 
02:02:16.950 --> 02:02:16.960 align:start position:0%
then it may still be subject to
 
02:02:19.390 --> 02:02:19.400 align:start position:0%
creditors claims and we have to un Trel
 
02:02:23.069 --> 02:02:23.079 align:start position:0%
all of that it could be very messy um it
 
02:02:25.109 --> 02:02:25.119 align:start position:0%
just creates a lot of risk of confusion
 
02:02:28.189 --> 02:02:28.199 align:start position:0%
and uncertainty that I think isn't
 
02:02:30.229 --> 02:02:30.239 align:start position:0%
really apparent with what seems like a
 
02:02:33.390 --> 02:02:33.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:36.950 --> 02:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
idea um the another um defect that I
 
02:02:38.709 --> 02:02:38.719 align:start position:0%
would like the committee to consider
 
02:02:41.229 --> 02:02:41.239 align:start position:0%
about this statute is that it doesn't
 
02:02:43.390 --> 02:02:43.400 align:start position:0%
offer a whole lot of guidance there are
 
02:02:46.109 --> 02:02:46.119 align:start position:0%
no forms attached it talks about the
 
02:02:47.830 --> 02:02:47.840 align:start position:0%
possibility not only the transfer of
 
02:02:51.589 --> 02:02:51.599 align:start position:0%
death uh on death deed but it also talks
 
02:02:53.470 --> 02:02:53.480 align:start position:0%
about re an instrument of
 
02:02:56.270 --> 02:02:56.280 align:start position:0%
revocation um there's no forms provided
 
02:02:59.149 --> 02:02:59.159 align:start position:0%
for that so again we're not offering the
 
02:03:01.470 --> 02:03:01.480 align:start position:0%
kind of guidance that we need to provide
 
02:03:04.030 --> 02:03:04.040 align:start position:0%
to both people who want to take
 
02:03:07.470 --> 02:03:07.480 align:start position:0%
advantage of this but also others title
 
02:03:10.189 --> 02:03:10.199 align:start position:0%
insurers creditors third other third
 
02:03:11.950 --> 02:03:11.960 align:start position:0%
parties who may have interest in this
 
02:03:15.030 --> 02:03:15.040 align:start position:0%
property are the forms sufficient is
 
02:03:16.669 --> 02:03:16.679 align:start position:0%
what's been done
 
02:03:19.350 --> 02:03:19.360 align:start position:0%
adequate um so that's another def that I
 
02:03:20.870 --> 02:03:20.880 align:start position:0%
think really needs to be looked at
 
02:03:23.310 --> 02:03:23.320 align:start position:0%
before this bill um is seriously
 
02:03:27.629 --> 02:03:27.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:29.790 --> 02:03:29.800 align:start position:0%
passage I think that's the bulk of what
 
02:03:32.270 --> 02:03:32.280 align:start position:0%
I'd like to say um again I am a real
 
02:03:33.950 --> 02:03:33.960 align:start position:0%
estate attorney and I'm happy to take
 
02:03:33.960 --> 02:03:36.830 align:start position:0%
estate attorney and I'm happy to take
any

02:03:36.830 --> 02:03:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:38.950 --> 02:03:38.960 align:start position:0%
questions any
 
02:03:41.990 --> 02:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
questions representative wer first uh
 
02:03:43.310 --> 02:03:43.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
02:03:45.470 --> 02:03:45.480 align:start position:0%
taking my question would you spell your
 
02:03:48.910 --> 02:03:48.920 align:start position:0%
name for me please certainly it's O VI
 
02:03:51.950 --> 02:03:51.960 align:start position:0%
Victor i t as and Tom another T as and
 
02:03:56.229 --> 02:03:56.239 align:start position:0%
Tom space p as and Peter U as an
 
02:04:02.069 --> 02:04:02.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:06.430 --> 02:04:06.440 align:start position:0%
Puck okay are you all set no but I'll
 
02:04:08.229 --> 02:04:08.239 align:start position:0%
I'll talk to her
 
02:04:10.629 --> 02:04:10.639 align:start position:0%
after I I think I know I can give that
 
02:04:12.149 --> 02:04:12.159 align:start position:0%
representative mlan did you have a
 
02:04:15.229 --> 02:04:15.239 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you um I'm sensitive
 
02:04:17.950 --> 02:04:17.960 align:start position:0%
to the testimony um about the the notice
 
02:04:20.149 --> 02:04:20.159 align:start position:0%
and acceptance and on the disclaimer
 
02:04:22.589 --> 02:04:22.599 align:start position:0%
side but I just I am just trying to
 
02:04:26.069 --> 02:04:26.079 align:start position:0%
reconcile in my mind why the bill put in
 
02:04:28.790 --> 02:04:28.800 align:start position:0%
explicit language saying that uh
 
02:04:31.910 --> 02:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
notification is not required so are you
 
02:04:34.669 --> 02:04:34.679 align:start position:0%
aware of any reason why that kind of
 
02:04:36.750 --> 02:04:36.760 align:start position:0%
language would have been put in the bill
 
02:04:39.149 --> 02:04:39.159 align:start position:0%
I know you're not the prime sponsor but
 
02:04:40.990 --> 02:04:41.000 align:start position:0%
well this is just speculation but it
 
02:04:43.390 --> 02:04:43.400 align:start position:0%
does give more flexibility for people
 
02:04:45.589 --> 02:04:45.599 align:start position:0%
who want to do this and don't
 
02:04:47.350 --> 02:04:47.360 align:start position:0%
necessarily want to notify the
 
02:04:51.229 --> 02:04:51.239 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries or track them down um
 
02:04:53.990 --> 02:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
that's that's you know and maybe some of
 
02:04:56.709 --> 02:04:56.719 align:start position:0%
the other um other people who will test
 
02:04:58.589 --> 02:04:58.599 align:start position:0%
if I have a better idea but that's
 
02:05:01.310 --> 02:05:01.320 align:start position:0%
that's the only Insight I have to offer
 
02:05:05.229 --> 02:05:05.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:07.030 --> 02:05:07.040 align:start position:0%
flexibility other questions
 
02:05:10.910 --> 02:05:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:13.870 --> 02:05:13.880 align:start position:0%
question thank you thank you for taking
 
02:05:16.030 --> 02:05:16.040 align:start position:0%
my question again I'm just trying to
 
02:05:19.510 --> 02:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
wrap my head around the the landh
 
02:05:22.510 --> 02:05:22.520 align:start position:0%
holding because one person said there
 
02:05:24.790 --> 02:05:24.800 align:start position:0%
wasn't a it could be a large land
 
02:05:28.030 --> 02:05:28.040 align:start position:0%
holding or or or small and then the last
 
02:05:30.390 --> 02:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
person who testified from um mayor
 
02:05:32.589 --> 02:05:32.599 align:start position:0%
mcdeed said it she was talking about
 
02:05:35.589 --> 02:05:35.599 align:start position:0%
small landh Holdings what how large of
 
02:05:37.229 --> 02:05:37.239 align:start position:0%
an estate are we talking about that
 
02:05:39.709 --> 02:05:39.719 align:start position:0%
someone can just leave the property to
 
02:05:43.109 --> 02:05:43.119 align:start position:0%
somebody my my understanding is that
 
02:05:46.390 --> 02:05:46.400 align:start position:0%
this this would apply no matter the size
 
02:05:49.189 --> 02:05:49.199 align:start position:0%
of the state that you could use a
 
02:05:51.510 --> 02:05:51.520 align:start position:0%
transfer of death deed regardless of the
 
02:05:54.390 --> 02:05:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:57.629 --> 02:05:57.639 align:start position:0%
state other
 
02:06:00.189 --> 02:06:00.199 align:start position:0%
questions typically in a real estate
 
02:06:02.830 --> 02:06:02.840 align:start position:0%
transfer if you just do a
 
02:06:06.229 --> 02:06:06.239 align:start position:0%
deed uh there is paperwork associated
 
02:06:08.549 --> 02:06:08.559 align:start position:0%
with that which
 
02:06:11.270 --> 02:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
would notify the federal government but
 
02:06:15.350 --> 02:06:15.360 align:start position:0%
notify the towns of the
 
02:06:20.109 --> 02:06:20.119 align:start position:0%
transfer and it appears that that's not
 
02:06:24.030 --> 02:06:24.040 align:start position:0%
required as a part of this if you if if
 
02:06:27.030 --> 02:06:27.040 align:start position:0%
you're not notifying the if you're not
 
02:06:29.790 --> 02:06:29.800 align:start position:0%
notifying the recipient potential
 
02:06:31.310 --> 02:06:31.320 align:start position:0%
recipient of the
 
02:06:33.549 --> 02:06:33.559 align:start position:0%
property how can you I guess the
 
02:06:35.629 --> 02:06:35.639 align:start position:0%
question is how can you properly notify
 
02:06:35.639 --> 02:06:37.229 align:start position:0%
question is how can you properly notify
the

02:06:37.229 --> 02:06:37.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:06:40.910 --> 02:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
town I I agree I think that's an issue
 
02:06:43.709 --> 02:06:43.719 align:start position:0%
so so when the deed is recorded there
 
02:06:45.430 --> 02:06:45.440 align:start position:0%
will be notice it will be recorded at
 
02:06:47.750 --> 02:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
the registry and there will be notice
 
02:06:49.510 --> 02:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
but there's no notice required to the
 
02:06:51.669 --> 02:06:51.679 align:start position:0%
beneficiary there's no kind of
 
02:06:53.790 --> 02:06:53.800 align:start position:0%
validating the beneficiary is somebody
 
02:06:56.390 --> 02:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
who actually exists who is alive who
 
02:06:58.149 --> 02:06:58.159 align:start position:0%
there they have a valid address all of
 
02:07:00.950 --> 02:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
that and there's no notice required to
 
02:07:03.589 --> 02:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
the beneficiary there's also no notice
 
02:07:05.910 --> 02:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
um that the actual effectiveness of the
 
02:07:08.669 --> 02:07:08.679 align:start position:0%
transfer is triggered by the transfer's
 
02:07:11.229 --> 02:07:11.239 align:start position:0%
death and there's no notice required for
 
02:07:16.310 --> 02:07:16.320 align:start position:0%
that so that's a Hu that's a huge gap
 
02:07:21.750 --> 02:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:25.069 --> 02:07:25.079 align:start position:0%
no you you can't so
 
02:07:29.589 --> 02:07:29.599 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you can I make one final
 
02:07:31.910 --> 02:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
comment um and I should have said this
 
02:07:34.669 --> 02:07:34.679 align:start position:0%
before a lot of statutes are
 
02:07:36.750 --> 02:07:36.760 align:start position:0%
interrelated and so one thing that I
 
02:07:39.109 --> 02:07:39.119 align:start position:0%
would urge this committee to consider is
 
02:07:41.589 --> 02:07:41.599 align:start position:0%
if they they are going to support this
 
02:07:44.549 --> 02:07:44.559 align:start position:0%
bill please look at the other statutes
 
02:07:47.149 --> 02:07:47.159 align:start position:0%
that may be affected by this so for
 
02:07:50.870 --> 02:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
example what happens if the transferer
 
02:07:54.310 --> 02:07:54.320 align:start position:0%
names their spouse and they get divorced
 
02:07:56.030 --> 02:07:56.040 align:start position:0%
does that you know we have statutes that
 
02:07:58.830 --> 02:07:58.840 align:start position:0%
relate to that um that we have a real
 
02:08:03.950 --> 02:08:03.960 align:start position:0%
estate transfer tax does that apply here
 
02:08:06.310 --> 02:08:06.320 align:start position:0%
um so I think it's crucial that if this
 
02:08:10.350 --> 02:08:10.360 align:start position:0%
bill is passed we think about all of the
 
02:08:13.510 --> 02:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
other statutes that may be impacted
 
02:08:16.030 --> 02:08:16.040 align:start position:0%
which have been carefully crafted um in
 
02:08:18.790 --> 02:08:18.800 align:start position:0%
light of our intesity scheme in light of
 
02:08:22.790 --> 02:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
our um our probate Statute in that
 
02:08:26.430 --> 02:08:26.440 align:start position:0%
process so thank you for your time today
 
02:08:30.229 --> 02:08:30.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:35.149 --> 02:08:35.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:37.589 --> 02:08:37.599 align:start position:0%
salik Miss craigan perhaps at the end
 
02:08:39.510 --> 02:08:39.520 align:start position:0%
we'll give you an opportunity to testify
 
02:08:41.270 --> 02:08:41.280 align:start position:0%
again but we let everybody have an
 
02:08:43.030 --> 02:08:43.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify
 
02:08:45.510 --> 02:08:45.520 align:start position:0%
first you thank you Mr chairman and
 
02:08:47.629 --> 02:08:47.639 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
02:08:48.950 --> 02:08:48.960 align:start position:0%
Elise s
 
02:08:51.310 --> 02:08:51.320 align:start position:0%
and I'm an attorney at Solway and Hollis
 
02:08:54.390 --> 02:08:54.400 align:start position:0%
here in conquer and I am an estate
 
02:08:56.750 --> 02:08:56.760 align:start position:0%
planner uh that is what I do and what
 
02:08:59.430 --> 02:08:59.440 align:start position:0%
I've done for the past 30 years and I'm
 
02:09:02.030 --> 02:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
here speaking on my own behalf in
 
02:09:04.390 --> 02:09:04.400 align:start position:0%
opposition to SB
 
02:09:07.430 --> 02:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
243 and I do have some background for
 
02:09:10.510 --> 02:09:10.520 align:start position:0%
the committee on our statute and how it
 
02:09:12.950 --> 02:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
compares to the statutes that have been
 
02:09:15.669 --> 02:09:15.679 align:start position:0%
passed in the other jurisdictions so
 
02:09:17.470 --> 02:09:17.480 align:start position:0%
just by way of background I think the
 
02:09:20.629 --> 02:09:20.639 align:start position:0%
committee should be aware that I I think
 
02:09:22.910 --> 02:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
it's 29 states in the district of
 
02:09:26.669 --> 02:09:26.679 align:start position:0%
Colombia not 31 states have some form of
 
02:09:29.229 --> 02:09:29.239 align:start position:0%
transfer on death deed legislation on
 
02:09:29.239 --> 02:09:29.910 align:start position:0%
transfer on death deed legislation on
the

02:09:29.910 --> 02:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:09:32.149 --> 02:09:32.159 align:start position:0%
books of those
 
02:09:32.159 --> 02:09:33.669 align:start position:0%
books of those
jurisdictions

02:09:33.669 --> 02:09:33.679 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions
 
02:09:38.149 --> 02:09:38.159 align:start position:0%
19 have statutes that are based on the
 
02:09:41.069 --> 02:09:41.079 align:start position:0%
uniform real property transfer on death
 
02:09:44.189 --> 02:09:44.199 align:start position:0%
act and that is the act that was used as
 
02:09:47.470 --> 02:09:47.480 align:start position:0%
the model for the statute that's forms
 
02:09:49.709 --> 02:09:49.719 align:start position:0%
the basis of
 
02:09:53.790 --> 02:09:53.800 align:start position:0%
b243 but the problem with our statute
 
02:09:55.870 --> 02:09:55.880 align:start position:0%
it's one of many problems from my
 
02:09:58.229 --> 02:09:58.239 align:start position:0%
perspective is that if you take a look
 
02:10:01.510 --> 02:10:01.520 align:start position:0%
at the uniform real property transfer on
 
02:10:03.990 --> 02:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
death act and you compare it to the
 
02:10:06.390 --> 02:10:06.400 align:start position:0%
words that are contained in s SP
 
02:10:11.390 --> 02:10:11.400 align:start position:0%
243 we're missing a third of the
 
02:10:15.669 --> 02:10:15.679 align:start position:0%
statutory language so the sponsor the
 
02:10:18.510 --> 02:10:18.520 align:start position:0%
drafters of this statute basically went
 
02:10:21.910 --> 02:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
so far and then stopped and that's
 
02:10:24.709 --> 02:10:24.719 align:start position:0%
what's creating some of the title issues
 
02:10:27.189 --> 02:10:27.199 align:start position:0%
and some of the concerns that have been
 
02:10:30.709 --> 02:10:30.719 align:start position:0%
raised by Miss kraan and by my colleague
 
02:10:33.549 --> 02:10:33.559 align:start position:0%
Kelly oit Puck but just to back up a
 
02:10:35.990 --> 02:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
little bit um there are a lot of issues
 
02:10:38.629 --> 02:10:38.639 align:start position:0%
with this statute I'm not here to say
 
02:10:41.229 --> 02:10:41.239 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire should not have a
 
02:10:43.870 --> 02:10:43.880 align:start position:0%
transfer on death deed statute I think
 
02:10:46.589 --> 02:10:46.599 align:start position:0%
we should I think it would be a valuable
 
02:10:50.069 --> 02:10:50.079 align:start position:0%
tool not just in my toolbox as an estate
 
02:10:52.910 --> 02:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
planner but also in the toolbox of lay
 
02:10:55.549 --> 02:10:55.559 align:start position:0%
people who are looking for a simple way
 
02:10:58.470 --> 02:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
to transfer property so I don't have a
 
02:11:01.790 --> 02:11:01.800 align:start position:0%
philosophical issue with SB
 
02:11:04.549 --> 02:11:04.559 align:start position:0%
243 I just think the statute is
 
02:11:06.830 --> 02:11:06.840 align:start position:0%
deficient and needs some
 
02:11:09.229 --> 02:11:09.239 align:start position:0%
improvement and by way of improvement
 
02:11:10.790 --> 02:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
I'm going to point to one issue that I
 
02:11:13.629 --> 02:11:13.639 align:start position:0%
see a lot in my practice because I also
 
02:11:16.109 --> 02:11:16.119 align:start position:0%
do probate litigation and that issue is
 
02:11:20.790 --> 02:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
undue influence I have a big concern
 
02:11:23.990 --> 02:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
about the elderly population here in New
 
02:11:27.750 --> 02:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire being unduly influenced to
 
02:11:30.910 --> 02:11:30.920 align:start position:0%
transfer property to their relatives or
 
02:11:33.229 --> 02:11:33.239 align:start position:0%
their friends this is an issue that we
 
02:11:36.030 --> 02:11:36.040 align:start position:0%
see every day and if you take a look at
 
02:11:39.470 --> 02:11:39.480 align:start position:0%
the California version of this statute
 
02:11:41.390 --> 02:11:41.400 align:start position:0%
you know I rarely look to California as
 
02:11:44.549 --> 02:11:44.559 align:start position:0%
a model of much but in this instance I
 
02:11:47.270 --> 02:11:47.280 align:start position:0%
think California got it right because
 
02:11:49.589 --> 02:11:49.599 align:start position:0%
what California did about five years ago
 
02:11:51.790 --> 02:11:51.800 align:start position:0%
is they passed their first transfer on
 
02:11:54.910 --> 02:11:54.920 align:start position:0%
death deed statute and they built a
 
02:11:57.990 --> 02:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
sunset provision in it a fiveyear sunset
 
02:12:01.669 --> 02:12:01.679 align:start position:0%
for the explicit purpose of looking back
 
02:12:04.270 --> 02:12:04.280 align:start position:0%
five years into having transfer on death
 
02:12:07.549 --> 02:12:07.559 align:start position:0%
Deeds to identify any problems or issues
 
02:12:09.750 --> 02:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
that had Arisen during that 5year period
 
02:12:12.430 --> 02:12:12.440 align:start position:0%
that then needed to be corrected and one
 
02:12:15.350 --> 02:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
of the biggest issues that happened in
 
02:12:18.870 --> 02:12:18.880 align:start position:0%
California is fraud and undoin for
 
02:12:21.270 --> 02:12:21.280 align:start position:0%
so in January of 2021 when the
 
02:12:23.589 --> 02:12:23.599 align:start position:0%
California legislature looked at its
 
02:12:26.390 --> 02:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
transfer on death deed statute after its
 
02:12:29.669 --> 02:12:29.679 align:start position:0%
initial implementation period of 5 years
 
02:12:32.990 --> 02:12:33.000 align:start position:0%
the first thing that they tweet was were
 
02:12:36.069 --> 02:12:36.079 align:start position:0%
the requirements for signing a valid
 
02:12:38.990 --> 02:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
transfer on death deed if you take a
 
02:12:41.069 --> 02:12:41.079 align:start position:0%
look at the language of SB
 
02:12:44.669 --> 02:12:44.679 align:start position:0%
243 right now in order to sign one of
 
02:12:47.069 --> 02:12:47.079 align:start position:0%
these transfer on death Deeds you need
 
02:12:49.069 --> 02:12:49.079 align:start position:0%
the same capacity that you would have to
 
02:12:51.709 --> 02:12:51.719 align:start position:0%
make a will and I think that's a good
 
02:12:54.629 --> 02:12:54.639 align:start position:0%
thing but there are no other
 
02:12:56.790 --> 02:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
requirements and right now in order to
 
02:12:58.709 --> 02:12:58.719 align:start position:0%
sign a deed here in New Hampshire you
 
02:13:00.870 --> 02:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
just have to put your name on the deed
 
02:13:02.990 --> 02:13:03.000 align:start position:0%
in the presence of a notary there are no
 
02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:04.470 align:start position:0%
in the presence of a notary there are no
witness

02:13:04.470 --> 02:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
witness
 
02:13:06.910 --> 02:13:06.920 align:start position:0%
requirements and what California has
 
02:13:09.629 --> 02:13:09.639 align:start position:0%
done is they've now added a provision to
 
02:13:12.109 --> 02:13:12.119 align:start position:0%
their statute to try to protect against
 
02:13:14.830 --> 02:13:14.840 align:start position:0%
fraud and undo influence by now
 
02:13:17.109 --> 02:13:17.119 align:start position:0%
requiring that transfer on death Deeds
 
02:13:18.589 --> 02:13:18.599 align:start position:0%
be accompanied
 
02:13:21.549 --> 02:13:21.559 align:start position:0%
by two witnesses and they've built a
 
02:13:24.350 --> 02:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
presumption into their statute that says
 
02:13:26.270 --> 02:13:26.280 align:start position:0%
that if the Witnesses are also the
 
02:13:28.430 --> 02:13:28.440 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries of the property their
 
02:13:31.589 --> 02:13:31.599 align:start position:0%
transactions presumptively invalid so I
 
02:13:33.790 --> 02:13:33.800 align:start position:0%
think if we're going to make an attempt
 
02:13:36.549 --> 02:13:36.559 align:start position:0%
to introduce or have a transfer on death
 
02:13:38.510 --> 02:13:38.520 align:start position:0%
Statute in New Hampshire we need to
 
02:13:40.629 --> 02:13:40.639 align:start position:0%
tackle the issue of un influence and we
 
02:13:42.390 --> 02:13:42.400 align:start position:0%
need to look to California and some of
 
02:13:43.870 --> 02:13:43.880 align:start position:0%
the other states that have had this
 
02:13:46.390 --> 02:13:46.400 align:start position:0%
legislation for a while and maybe think
 
02:13:49.350 --> 02:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
about adding w witness requirements on
 
02:13:52.390 --> 02:13:52.400 align:start position:0%
these deeds and from my perspective as
 
02:13:54.390 --> 02:13:54.400 align:start position:0%
an estate planner these Deeds are
 
02:13:57.109 --> 02:13:57.119 align:start position:0%
revocable which is a wonderful thing you
 
02:13:58.910 --> 02:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
can you should be able to change your
 
02:14:00.709 --> 02:14:00.719 align:start position:0%
mind about the people you've named in
 
02:14:02.830 --> 02:14:02.840 align:start position:0%
your transfer on death deed but if
 
02:14:04.350 --> 02:14:04.360 align:start position:0%
you're going to be able to revoke your
 
02:14:06.510 --> 02:14:06.520 align:start position:0%
deed then you should have you you should
 
02:14:08.149 --> 02:14:08.159 align:start position:0%
be able to revoke it under the same
 
02:14:11.310 --> 02:14:11.320 align:start position:0%
legal standards that too should require
 
02:14:14.229 --> 02:14:14.239 align:start position:0%
Witnesses and so there that issue is not
 
02:14:17.109 --> 02:14:17.119 align:start position:0%
addressed at all in SB 243 and I really
 
02:14:19.430 --> 02:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
think it needs to
 
02:14:22.030 --> 02:14:22.040 align:start position:0%
be another issue is the issue of
 
02:14:23.870 --> 02:14:23.880 align:start position:0%
contingent beneficiaries and this is
 
02:14:26.709 --> 02:14:26.719 align:start position:0%
something that Miss craigan touched on
 
02:14:28.589 --> 02:14:28.599 align:start position:0%
what happens if you leave your property
 
02:14:30.790 --> 02:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
in a transfer on death deed to your two
 
02:14:33.990 --> 02:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
children and one of them pred deases you
 
02:14:36.790 --> 02:14:36.800 align:start position:0%
they're just not alive to take the
 
02:14:40.030 --> 02:14:40.040 align:start position:0%
property under the current statute
 
02:14:42.310 --> 02:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
that's before you at SB
 
02:14:46.870 --> 02:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
243 the deceased child's interest
 
02:14:49.750 --> 02:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
lapses so basically the property goes
 
02:14:51.830 --> 02:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
100% to your surviving
 
02:14:54.310 --> 02:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
child as an estate planner I can tell
 
02:14:57.910 --> 02:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
you that in my practice parents don't do
 
02:15:00.430 --> 02:15:00.440 align:start position:0%
that what parents like to say in their
 
02:15:02.589 --> 02:15:02.599 align:start position:0%
wills and in their trusts is that if a
 
02:15:02.599 --> 02:15:03.750 align:start position:0%
wills and in their trusts is that if a
child

02:15:03.750 --> 02:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
child
 
02:15:06.229 --> 02:15:06.239 align:start position:0%
predeceases the deceased child's
 
02:15:09.149 --> 02:15:09.159 align:start position:0%
interest passes down the line to
 
02:15:11.709 --> 02:15:11.719 align:start position:0%
grandchildren or to great-grandchildren
 
02:15:15.669 --> 02:15:15.679 align:start position:0%
there's no opportunity in Sp 243 to do
 
02:15:18.149 --> 02:15:18.159 align:start position:0%
that and in some of the more well
 
02:15:21.669 --> 02:15:21.679 align:start position:0%
crafted transfer on death deed statutes
 
02:15:24.549 --> 02:15:24.559 align:start position:0%
there is the ability to name contingent
 
02:15:26.790 --> 02:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries the interest of a deceased
 
02:15:30.709 --> 02:15:30.719 align:start position:0%
beneficiary doesn't just lapse so again
 
02:15:32.229 --> 02:15:32.239 align:start position:0%
my position is that if you're going to
 
02:15:34.830 --> 02:15:34.840 align:start position:0%
do this we should do this right and we
 
02:15:37.229 --> 02:15:37.239 align:start position:0%
should give the members of of the public
 
02:15:39.750 --> 02:15:39.760 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire an opportunity to
 
02:15:42.589 --> 02:15:42.599 align:start position:0%
name contingent beneficiaries in their
 
02:15:44.870 --> 02:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
deeds I think that's an important
 
02:15:44.880 --> 02:15:46.790 align:start position:0%
deeds I think that's an important
planning

02:15:46.790 --> 02:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
planning
 
02:15:46.800 --> 02:15:49.470 align:start position:0%
planning
tool

02:15:49.470 --> 02:15:49.480 align:start position:0%
tool
 
02:15:50.990 --> 02:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
I also have some concerns about
 
02:15:53.629 --> 02:15:53.639 align:start position:0%
electronic signatures um we have an
 
02:15:55.470 --> 02:15:55.480 align:start position:0%
electronic signature act in New
 
02:15:57.990 --> 02:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you are currently allowed to
 
02:16:00.510 --> 02:16:00.520 align:start position:0%
sign a deed electronically but there's
 
02:16:03.950 --> 02:16:03.960 align:start position:0%
no mention in s SP 243 as to whether
 
02:16:07.390 --> 02:16:07.400 align:start position:0%
transfer on death Deeds also are subject
 
02:16:09.990 --> 02:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
to electronic signature requirements and
 
02:16:11.629 --> 02:16:11.639 align:start position:0%
as Kelly said there are a lot there's a
 
02:16:13.750 --> 02:16:13.760 align:start position:0%
lot of interplay between real estate
 
02:16:16.510 --> 02:16:16.520 align:start position:0%
transactions and other statutes and so
 
02:16:18.510 --> 02:16:18.520 align:start position:0%
the electronic signatures act really
 
02:16:21.750 --> 02:16:21.760 align:start position:0%
needs to be looked at and woven into the
 
02:16:24.149 --> 02:16:24.159 align:start position:0%
fabric of our transfer on death deed
 
02:16:27.589 --> 02:16:27.599 align:start position:0%
legislation if we're going to go this
 
02:16:30.669 --> 02:16:30.679 align:start position:0%
route my other issue and this is not
 
02:16:33.030 --> 02:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
addressed at all in Sp 243 is what about
 
02:16:34.270 --> 02:16:34.280 align:start position:0%
Powers of
 
02:16:36.830 --> 02:16:36.840 align:start position:0%
Attorney if you're
 
02:16:39.589 --> 02:16:39.599 align:start position:0%
incapacitated and you're and you're
 
02:16:41.309 --> 02:16:41.319 align:start position:0%
you've got a durable power attorney one
 
02:16:43.589 --> 02:16:43.599 align:start position:0%
of your kids is paying your bills and
 
02:16:45.830 --> 02:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
taking care of all of your financial
 
02:16:48.469 --> 02:16:48.479 align:start position:0%
affairs do we think it's appropriate as
 
02:16:51.790 --> 02:16:51.800 align:start position:0%
a matter of public policy to allow
 
02:16:54.469 --> 02:16:54.479 align:start position:0%
agents under durable Powers of Attorney
 
02:16:58.389 --> 02:16:58.399 align:start position:0%
to sign a transfer on death deed I don't
 
02:17:00.790 --> 02:17:00.800 align:start position:0%
know the answer to that question but I
 
02:17:02.790 --> 02:17:02.800 align:start position:0%
know in a lot of the states that have
 
02:17:05.190 --> 02:17:05.200 align:start position:0%
enacted this kind of legislation there
 
02:17:08.309 --> 02:17:08.319 align:start position:0%
is specific mention in their statute
 
02:17:10.790 --> 02:17:10.800 align:start position:0%
that either permits an agent under a
 
02:17:13.110 --> 02:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
power of attorney to sign one of these
 
02:17:15.790 --> 02:17:15.800 align:start position:0%
Deeds on behalf of someone who's
 
02:17:18.230 --> 02:17:18.240 align:start position:0%
incapacitated or there's an
 
02:17:20.509 --> 02:17:20.519 align:start position:0%
explicit reference in the statute that
 
02:17:23.910 --> 02:17:23.920 align:start position:0%
says you can't allow an agent to sign
 
02:17:26.629 --> 02:17:26.639 align:start position:0%
one of these Deeds I think that issue
 
02:17:30.589 --> 02:17:30.599 align:start position:0%
should also be addressed and if we do
 
02:17:32.070 --> 02:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
want to address this issue we're going
 
02:17:35.070 --> 02:17:35.080 align:start position:0%
to have to take a look at our dpoa
 
02:17:36.990 --> 02:17:37.000 align:start position:0%
statute and we're going to need to make
 
02:17:39.469 --> 02:17:39.479 align:start position:0%
some changes to the durable power of
 
02:17:43.469 --> 02:17:43.479 align:start position:0%
attorney act to create the powers needed
 
02:17:45.629 --> 02:17:45.639 align:start position:0%
to sign one of these transfer on death
 
02:17:48.709 --> 02:17:48.719 align:start position:0%
Deeds on behalf of an in capacitated
 
02:17:50.910 --> 02:17:50.920 align:start position:0%
individual I'm not saying it's a bad
 
02:17:52.990 --> 02:17:53.000 align:start position:0%
idea I again I think that would be a
 
02:17:55.950 --> 02:17:55.960 align:start position:0%
useful tool but we've got to look at
 
02:17:59.990 --> 02:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
multiple statutes if we want to go that
 
02:18:02.589 --> 02:18:02.599 align:start position:0%
route my final comment has to do with
 
02:18:05.190 --> 02:18:05.200 align:start position:0%
contesting a transfer on death
 
02:18:08.589 --> 02:18:08.599 align:start position:0%
deed if there has been fraud or undue
 
02:18:11.230 --> 02:18:11.240 align:start position:0%
influence in the in the execution of one
 
02:18:13.830 --> 02:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
of these Deeds there needs to be a
 
02:18:17.629 --> 02:18:17.639 align:start position:0%
provision in our statute that permits
 
02:18:22.150 --> 02:18:22.160 align:start position:0%
people to contest that deed and again in
 
02:18:24.549 --> 02:18:24.559 align:start position:0%
most of the well-crafted statutes that
 
02:18:29.709 --> 02:18:29.719 align:start position:0%
I've seen those Provisions do exist so
 
02:18:33.750 --> 02:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
you know in in wrapup my my concerns are
 
02:18:37.110 --> 02:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
that our statute is deficient in that it
 
02:18:39.469 --> 02:18:39.479 align:start position:0%
does not contain all of the language
 
02:18:41.110 --> 02:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
that the model act
 
02:18:43.790 --> 02:18:43.800 align:start position:0%
contains there are 30 other
 
02:18:45.669 --> 02:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions out there that have done
 
02:18:48.469 --> 02:18:48.479 align:start position:0%
this before and if we take a look at
 
02:18:51.270 --> 02:18:51.280 align:start position:0%
their statutes and incorporate the best
 
02:18:54.709 --> 02:18:54.719 align:start position:0%
of what's out there I think we will have
 
02:18:57.750 --> 02:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
a very good piece of legislation but I
 
02:19:00.709 --> 02:19:00.719 align:start position:0%
don't think we're there
 
02:19:03.549 --> 02:19:03.559 align:start position:0%
yet thank you other
 
02:19:07.429 --> 02:19:07.439 align:start position:0%
questions uh yes representative
 
02:19:10.030 --> 02:19:10.040 align:start position:0%
mner yes and the last piece on uh
 
02:19:11.870 --> 02:19:11.880 align:start position:0%
contestants so that would be kicked to
 
02:19:15.230 --> 02:19:15.240 align:start position:0%
probate well that's a good question um
 
02:19:18.030 --> 02:19:18.040 align:start position:0%
typically when you're contesting a will
 
02:19:20.110 --> 02:19:20.120 align:start position:0%
or a conveyance that takes effect at
 
02:19:23.230 --> 02:19:23.240 align:start position:0%
death the Circuit Court probate division
 
02:19:26.150 --> 02:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
does have jurisdiction over those claims
 
02:19:28.070 --> 02:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
but there's nothing in the statute that
 
02:19:30.830 --> 02:19:30.840 align:start position:0%
says that and so I
 
02:19:33.750 --> 02:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
suspect those claims could be brought
 
02:19:38.070 --> 02:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
in Superior Court I I have no idea and
 
02:19:40.230 --> 02:19:40.240 align:start position:0%
so the jurisdictional issue does need to
 
02:19:43.110 --> 02:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
be addressed I to me it makes logical
 
02:19:45.589 --> 02:19:45.599 align:start position:0%
sense if you're going to allow a contest
 
02:19:47.389 --> 02:19:47.399 align:start position:0%
to have that contest heard in the C
 
02:19:49.670 --> 02:19:49.680 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court probate division but again
 
02:19:51.870 --> 02:19:51.880 align:start position:0%
that's an issue of public policy and it
 
02:19:54.510 --> 02:19:54.520 align:start position:0%
should be addressed in the
 
02:19:57.349 --> 02:19:57.359 align:start position:0%
statute other
 
02:19:59.510 --> 02:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
02:19:59.520 --> 02:20:01.870 align:start position:0%

today testifying on my own
 
02:20:35.910 --> 02:20:35.920 align:start position:0%
behalf um and um I am in opposition to
 
02:20:37.309 --> 02:20:37.319 align:start position:0%
the bill as
 
02:20:41.870 --> 02:20:41.880 align:start position:0%
written um my practice is limited to
 
02:20:41.880 --> 02:20:43.070 align:start position:0%
written um my practice is limited to
probate

02:20:43.070 --> 02:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
probate
 
02:20:46.950 --> 02:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
litigation um and messy probate issues
 
02:20:49.030 --> 02:20:49.040 align:start position:0%
um sometimes that AR full born
 
02:20:52.790 --> 02:20:52.800 align:start position:0%
full-blown litigation but often times um
 
02:20:54.670 --> 02:20:54.680 align:start position:0%
I deal with issues that arise with
 
02:20:56.590 --> 02:20:56.600 align:start position:0%
problems with statutory construction and
 
02:20:58.270 --> 02:20:58.280 align:start position:0%
that sort of
 
02:21:02.309 --> 02:21:02.319 align:start position:0%
thing um I I wanted to testify a little
 
02:21:05.150 --> 02:21:05.160 align:start position:0%
bit about disclaimer but I think that um
 
02:21:07.150 --> 02:21:07.160 align:start position:0%
issue has been very thoroughly covered
 
02:21:10.150 --> 02:21:10.160 align:start position:0%
by all those who have spoken before me
 
02:21:14.110 --> 02:21:14.120 align:start position:0%
um I I I just um want to reiterate
 
02:21:17.630 --> 02:21:17.640 align:start position:0%
however that I think that if as written
 
02:21:19.469 --> 02:21:19.479 align:start position:0%
this would be the only type of gift that
 
02:21:21.590 --> 02:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
could be made without the consent of the
 
02:21:25.070 --> 02:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
gift recipient I think every other um
 
02:21:28.309 --> 02:21:28.319 align:start position:0%
type of gift that is made um has to be
 
02:21:31.510 --> 02:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
accepted and our disclaimer statute
 
02:21:34.510 --> 02:21:34.520 align:start position:0%
acknowledges that and allows without any
 
02:21:37.910 --> 02:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
time limitation a person to disclaim a
 
02:21:40.389 --> 02:21:40.399 align:start position:0%
gift um whether it's during a life made
 
02:21:43.469 --> 02:21:43.479 align:start position:0%
during the lifetime or upon death um
 
02:21:46.110 --> 02:21:46.120 align:start position:0%
just provided that they have not already
 
02:21:49.630 --> 02:21:49.640 align:start position:0%
exercised IND of ownership of the
 
02:21:53.469 --> 02:21:53.479 align:start position:0%
property I think that there's a um
 
02:21:59.510 --> 02:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
problem as attorney salic um very um you
 
02:22:02.750 --> 02:22:02.760 align:start position:0%
know considerately addressed with
 
02:22:06.030 --> 02:22:06.040 align:start position:0%
pulling out pieces of a uniform body of
 
02:22:10.710 --> 02:22:10.720 align:start position:0%
law that um you know don't don't include
 
02:22:12.429 --> 02:22:12.439 align:start position:0%
all the necessary
 
02:22:16.670 --> 02:22:16.680 align:start position:0%
components the other issue is there may
 
02:22:18.389 --> 02:22:18.399 align:start position:0%
be a
 
02:22:22.790 --> 02:22:22.800 align:start position:0%
uniform um act concerning this type of
 
02:22:25.630 --> 02:22:25.640 align:start position:0%
transfer but in most of the states that
 
02:22:27.750 --> 02:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
have adopted such a thing they've
 
02:22:30.630 --> 02:22:30.640 align:start position:0%
Incorporated with it with all the other
 
02:22:33.590 --> 02:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
uniform bodies of law so that even
 
02:22:35.150 --> 02:22:35.160 align:start position:0%
though it's talking about real estate
 
02:22:37.870 --> 02:22:37.880 align:start position:0%
transfers it makes reference to probate
 
02:22:40.270 --> 02:22:40.280 align:start position:0%
terms that are defined in that state
 
02:22:42.349 --> 02:22:42.359 align:start position:0%
uniform probate code which is something
 
02:22:43.990 --> 02:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
we don't have here in New
 
02:22:46.910 --> 02:22:46.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and when when those terms are
 
02:22:48.910 --> 02:22:48.920 align:start position:0%
pulled pulled in it may may may make
 
02:22:51.630 --> 02:22:51.640 align:start position:0%
sense to lay people but then lawyers get
 
02:22:54.230 --> 02:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
to deal with them in court afterwards
 
02:22:56.309 --> 02:22:56.319 align:start position:0%
and they're trying to figure out what
 
02:22:59.070 --> 02:22:59.080 align:start position:0%
that specific term means when it's part
 
02:23:01.349 --> 02:23:01.359 align:start position:0%
of a defined body of law that we have
 
02:23:01.359 --> 02:23:03.270 align:start position:0%
of a defined body of law that we have
not

02:23:03.270 --> 02:23:03.280 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:23:07.349 --> 02:23:07.359 align:start position:0%
adopted so having said that um I think
 
02:23:09.630 --> 02:23:09.640 align:start position:0%
that there's a um General problem with
 
02:23:13.630 --> 02:23:13.640 align:start position:0%
the statute that a lot of the deadlines
 
02:23:15.349 --> 02:23:15.359 align:start position:0%
that are included are triggered by the
 
02:23:18.790 --> 02:23:18.800 align:start position:0%
date of death and just for edification
 
02:23:21.710 --> 02:23:21.720 align:start position:0%
purposes probate law is not triggered by
 
02:23:24.070 --> 02:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
date of death probate law is triggered
 
02:23:27.070 --> 02:23:27.080 align:start position:0%
by the date that probate is opened and
 
02:23:29.710 --> 02:23:29.720 align:start position:0%
in fact most deadlines in Probate are
 
02:23:32.389 --> 02:23:32.399 align:start position:0%
defined by the date the administrator is
 
02:23:35.469 --> 02:23:35.479 align:start position:0%
appointed by the court which may be very
 
02:23:38.750 --> 02:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
far from the date that the probate the
 
02:23:40.670 --> 02:23:40.680 align:start position:0%
will and the petition to open probate
 
02:23:40.680 --> 02:23:41.349 align:start position:0%
will and the petition to open probate
are

02:23:41.349 --> 02:23:41.359 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:23:45.309 --> 02:23:45.319 align:start position:0%
filed so um having said those General
 
02:23:47.349 --> 02:23:47.359 align:start position:0%
things I'd like to talk specifically
 
02:23:49.510 --> 02:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
about the Creditor section of the
 
02:23:52.349 --> 02:23:52.359 align:start position:0%
statute and I have had some experience
 
02:23:55.230 --> 02:23:55.240 align:start position:0%
with um the problems in our current
 
02:23:57.349 --> 02:23:57.359 align:start position:0%
statutory scheme concerning trust
 
02:23:59.349 --> 02:23:59.359 align:start position:0%
property that's available to pay
 
02:24:00.710 --> 02:24:00.720 align:start position:0%
creditors of an
 
02:24:04.710 --> 02:24:04.720 align:start position:0%
estate and the New Hampshire probate
 
02:24:07.429 --> 02:24:07.439 align:start position:0%
statutes has a very
 
02:24:10.030 --> 02:24:10.040 align:start position:0%
Express um and
 
02:24:13.150 --> 02:24:13.160 align:start position:0%
clear mechanism for how creditors claims
 
02:24:14.630 --> 02:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
get filed and
 
02:24:17.389 --> 02:24:17.399 align:start position:0%
paid upon the appointment of the
 
02:24:19.750 --> 02:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
administrator the creditors have 6
 
02:24:21.950 --> 02:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
months from the date of the appointment
 
02:24:24.349 --> 02:24:24.359 align:start position:0%
of the administrator to file a claim
 
02:24:26.870 --> 02:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
with the court and then in the second
 
02:24:30.230 --> 02:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
six months if the Creditor has some
 
02:24:32.550 --> 02:24:32.560 align:start position:0%
Communications with the executive of the
 
02:24:34.469 --> 02:24:34.479 align:start position:0%
estate about getting paid and it appears
 
02:24:36.150 --> 02:24:36.160 align:start position:0%
that the executive does not intend to
 
02:24:38.630 --> 02:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
pay those things then the Creditor has
 
02:24:40.550 --> 02:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
to bring a lawsuit against the estate
 
02:24:42.710 --> 02:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
within that second six-month period of
 
02:24:42.720 --> 02:24:44.269 align:start position:0%
within that second six-month period of
time

02:24:44.269 --> 02:24:44.279 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:24:49.070 --> 02:24:49.080 align:start position:0%
and um and and see if their claim is
 
02:24:51.990 --> 02:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
legally viable and if it is then the
 
02:24:53.870 --> 02:24:53.880 align:start position:0%
executive has to or the administrator
 
02:24:55.269 --> 02:24:55.279 align:start position:0%
has to pay that
 
02:24:55.279 --> 02:24:56.910 align:start position:0%
has to pay that
claim

02:24:56.910 --> 02:24:56.920 align:start position:0%
claim
 
02:25:00.870 --> 02:25:00.880 align:start position:0%
um here we're talking about creditor's
 
02:25:03.630 --> 02:25:03.640 align:start position:0%
claims being paid within 18 months after
 
02:25:06.030 --> 02:25:06.040 align:start position:0%
the date of death there's no
 
02:25:09.070 --> 02:25:09.080 align:start position:0%
guarantee that you're going to have an
 
02:25:10.750 --> 02:25:10.760 align:start position:0%
estate open and that you're going to
 
02:25:12.870 --> 02:25:12.880 align:start position:0%
know what all the creditors claims are
 
02:25:15.870 --> 02:25:15.880 align:start position:0%
within that 18th month period it is
 
02:25:18.550 --> 02:25:18.560 align:start position:0%
possible um that it wouldn't happen
 
02:25:21.830 --> 02:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
until after that sometimes people delay
 
02:25:24.150 --> 02:25:24.160 align:start position:0%
opening probate because of the grieving
 
02:25:26.790 --> 02:25:26.800 align:start position:0%
process um there's all sorts of things
 
02:25:28.190 --> 02:25:28.200 align:start position:0%
that can happen sometimes there are
 
02:25:29.950 --> 02:25:29.960 align:start position:0%
fights over who is going to be the
 
02:25:32.870 --> 02:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
executive of the estate and and that
 
02:25:35.550 --> 02:25:35.560 align:start position:0%
requires uh you know litigation our
 
02:25:37.950 --> 02:25:37.960 align:start position:0%
courts are already so overburdened that
 
02:25:40.590 --> 02:25:40.600 align:start position:0%
they cannot handle those things always
 
02:25:43.269 --> 02:25:43.279 align:start position:0%
within a you know what to The Grieving
 
02:25:44.830 --> 02:25:44.840 align:start position:0%
parties would think is a reasonable
 
02:25:47.510 --> 02:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
period of time um
 
02:25:51.150 --> 02:25:51.160 align:start position:0%
so that that's a timing process with
 
02:25:53.269 --> 02:25:53.279 align:start position:0%
regard to the claim there's a reference
 
02:25:56.110 --> 02:25:56.120 align:start position:0%
in um 563
 
02:26:00.710 --> 02:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
D15 to the payment of an allowed
 
02:26:03.710 --> 02:26:03.720 align:start position:0%
claim of an estate there's no such thing
 
02:26:07.269 --> 02:26:07.279 align:start position:0%
in our estate process of allowed claims
 
02:26:09.269 --> 02:26:09.279 align:start position:0%
unless you have an insolvent estate that
 
02:26:11.110 --> 02:26:11.120 align:start position:0%
you that you've got administered and
 
02:26:13.910 --> 02:26:13.920 align:start position:0%
then there's a whole insolvency process
 
02:26:16.030 --> 02:26:16.040 align:start position:0%
but that's not referred to here they
 
02:26:19.269 --> 02:26:19.279 align:start position:0%
just talk about an allowed
 
02:26:24.830 --> 02:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
claim it's not clear to me that a um if
 
02:26:27.230 --> 02:26:27.240 align:start position:0%
there are assets in someone's trust that
 
02:26:30.110 --> 02:26:30.120 align:start position:0%
are available to pay the debts of an
 
02:26:31.830 --> 02:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
estate that you have to go through the
 
02:26:36.190 --> 02:26:36.200 align:start position:0%
whole insolvency process um which is you
 
02:26:38.429 --> 02:26:38.439 align:start position:0%
know complicated and more costly it's
 
02:26:41.269 --> 02:26:41.279 align:start position:0%
easier just to call them in because
 
02:26:43.469 --> 02:26:43.479 align:start position:0%
they're required to be called in under
 
02:26:47.750 --> 02:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
law um having said that I'll get to the
 
02:26:50.469 --> 02:26:50.479 align:start position:0%
problem that I had before so I had a
 
02:26:53.269 --> 02:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
decedent who had an estate he also had a
 
02:26:55.790 --> 02:26:55.800 align:start position:0%
trust his trust owned a business the
 
02:26:58.070 --> 02:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
business had very specific debts that it
 
02:27:00.309 --> 02:27:00.319 align:start position:0%
owed after the guy
 
02:27:04.190 --> 02:27:04.200 align:start position:0%
died the trustee paid the debts of the
 
02:27:07.389 --> 02:27:07.399 align:start position:0%
trust paid started to gather information
 
02:27:09.230 --> 02:27:09.240 align:start position:0%
about the estate come to find out that
 
02:27:11.870 --> 02:27:11.880 align:start position:0%
deedan hadn't paid his income taxes for
 
02:27:14.309 --> 02:27:14.319 align:start position:0%
years and his estate was
 
02:27:17.030 --> 02:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
insolvent so they had to call in the
 
02:27:18.910 --> 02:27:18.920 align:start position:0%
assets of his
 
02:27:21.710 --> 02:27:21.720 align:start position:0%
trust well the statutory scheme that we
 
02:27:23.910 --> 02:27:23.920 align:start position:0%
have now and there is a statute that
 
02:27:27.230 --> 02:27:27.240 align:start position:0%
says the debts of a decedent
 
02:27:30.870 --> 02:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
are properly can be paid out or they're
 
02:27:34.150 --> 02:27:34.160 align:start position:0%
subject to that the trust is subject to
 
02:27:37.150 --> 02:27:37.160 align:start position:0%
pay claims of the estate for which the
 
02:27:39.110 --> 02:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
assets are
 
02:27:42.190 --> 02:27:42.200 align:start position:0%
insufficient it doesn't say that the
 
02:27:45.030 --> 02:27:45.040 align:start position:0%
debts and the assets of the trust are
 
02:27:48.389 --> 02:27:48.399 align:start position:0%
basically treated as a whole with the
 
02:27:52.070 --> 02:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
estate and that everything gets paid
 
02:27:54.429 --> 02:27:54.439 align:start position:0%
prata that is how the judge treated it
 
02:27:57.550 --> 02:27:57.560 align:start position:0%
in the case I had I don't know that
 
02:28:01.349 --> 02:28:01.359 align:start position:0%
that's clear under the law and in
 
02:28:02.710 --> 02:28:02.720 align:start position:0%
another case we might have gone up
 
02:28:04.230 --> 02:28:04.240 align:start position:0%
before The Supreme Court we did not do
 
02:28:06.110 --> 02:28:06.120 align:start position:0%
with that on the one that we have here
 
02:28:07.870 --> 02:28:07.880 align:start position:0%
now we're adding with this statute
 
02:28:10.150 --> 02:28:10.160 align:start position:0%
another layer where you're talking about
 
02:28:13.429 --> 02:28:13.439 align:start position:0%
this deed that transfers property upon
 
02:28:15.670 --> 02:28:15.680 align:start position:0%
death can be subject to claims of
 
02:28:19.429 --> 02:28:19.439 align:start position:0%
creditors well what priority is it prata
 
02:28:21.110 --> 02:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
with the assets of the estate that it
 
02:28:23.030 --> 02:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
would be applied do you have to use up
 
02:28:24.590 --> 02:28:24.600 align:start position:0%
all the assets of the estate and then
 
02:28:27.030 --> 02:28:27.040 align:start position:0%
you go to the trust first and then to
 
02:28:29.910 --> 02:28:29.920 align:start position:0%
the deeded property or how how does all
 
02:28:33.469 --> 02:28:33.479 align:start position:0%
that work that is not part of this and I
 
02:28:35.429 --> 02:28:35.439 align:start position:0%
think that at some point that's probably
 
02:28:37.150 --> 02:28:37.160 align:start position:0%
going to come
 
02:28:40.269 --> 02:28:40.279 align:start position:0%
up um there are
 
02:28:42.950 --> 02:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
references um
 
02:28:48.389 --> 02:28:48.399 align:start position:0%
in the statute I think it's um section
 
02:28:48.399 --> 02:28:50.110 align:start position:0%
in the statute I think it's um section
13

02:28:50.110 --> 02:28:50.120 align:start position:0%
13
 
02:28:50.120 --> 02:28:53.950 align:start position:0%
13
to

02:28:53.950 --> 02:28:53.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:57.269 --> 02:28:57.279 align:start position:0%
um it's and it's paragraph one so 563
 
02:29:00.429 --> 02:29:00.439 align:start position:0%
D13 paragraph 1 it says as except as
 
02:29:01.950 --> 02:29:01.960 align:start position:0%
otherwise provided in the transfer on
 
02:29:01.960 --> 02:29:03.030 align:start position:0%
otherwise provided in the transfer on
death

02:29:03.030 --> 02:29:03.040 align:start position:0%
death
 
02:29:07.429 --> 02:29:07.439 align:start position:0%
deed um or in statutes governing
 
02:29:09.550 --> 02:29:09.560 align:start position:0%
anti-lapse revocation by divorce or
 
02:29:11.550 --> 02:29:11.560 align:start position:0%
homicide survival and simultaneous death
 
02:29:13.269 --> 02:29:13.279 align:start position:0%
and elective share if applicable to
 
02:29:13.279 --> 02:29:15.230 align:start position:0%
and elective share if applicable to
nonprobate

02:29:15.230 --> 02:29:15.240 align:start position:0%
nonprobate
 
02:29:17.750 --> 02:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
transfers I'm unaware of any of those
 
02:29:19.550 --> 02:29:19.560 align:start position:0%
things being applicable to nonprobate
 
02:29:21.910 --> 02:29:21.920 align:start position:0%
transfers as our laws currently stand
 
02:29:23.750 --> 02:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
and I would suggest that it not be in
 
02:29:26.950 --> 02:29:26.960 align:start position:0%
there if it's not applicable right now
 
02:29:29.670 --> 02:29:29.680 align:start position:0%
um because you're just creating I think
 
02:29:32.150 --> 02:29:32.160 align:start position:0%
a suggestions confusion to some people
 
02:29:35.750 --> 02:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
that maybe there's um some opening there
 
02:29:39.309 --> 02:29:39.319 align:start position:0%
to make hey about those
 
02:29:39.319 --> 02:29:42.429 align:start position:0%
to make hey about those
things

02:29:42.429 --> 02:29:42.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:45.910 --> 02:29:45.920 align:start position:0%
um the Creditor section also says that
 
02:29:45.920 --> 02:29:47.070 align:start position:0%
um the Creditor section also says that
the

02:29:47.070 --> 02:29:47.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:29:47.080 --> 02:29:48.630 align:start position:0%
the
State

02:29:48.630 --> 02:29:48.640 align:start position:0%
State
 
02:29:52.030 --> 02:29:52.040 align:start position:0%
enforces the claims against the property
 
02:29:54.670 --> 02:29:54.680 align:start position:0%
well if you've got as the very nice lady
 
02:29:56.750 --> 02:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
from Goffstown testified earlier a
 
02:29:58.710 --> 02:29:58.720 align:start position:0%
single asset you've got no probate
 
02:30:01.269 --> 02:30:01.279 align:start position:0%
you're doing this to avoid probate who's
 
02:30:03.790 --> 02:30:03.800 align:start position:0%
the estate who's going to enforce that
 
02:30:05.389 --> 02:30:05.399 align:start position:0%
who's going to open that up is the
 
02:30:07.710 --> 02:30:07.720 align:start position:0%
Creditor going to open that up and then
 
02:30:09.150 --> 02:30:09.160 align:start position:0%
the Creditor is going to charge all
 
02:30:10.990 --> 02:30:11.000 align:start position:0%
kinds of charges to open up the probate
 
02:30:12.790 --> 02:30:12.800 align:start position:0%
and to find people and that's going to
 
02:30:15.429 --> 02:30:15.439 align:start position:0%
be a costly
 
02:30:15.439 --> 02:30:19.309 align:start position:0%
be a costly
thing

02:30:19.309 --> 02:30:19.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:21.630 --> 02:30:21.640 align:start position:0%
um there's also a reference in the
 
02:30:26.230 --> 02:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
Creditor section to an
 
02:30:29.990 --> 02:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
allowance um to a surviving spouse or
 
02:30:34.429 --> 02:30:34.439 align:start position:0%
child we don't we have those perhaps in
 
02:30:34.439 --> 02:30:35.510 align:start position:0%
child we don't we have those perhaps in
under

02:30:35.510 --> 02:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
under
 
02:30:38.150 --> 02:30:38.160 align:start position:0%
intestacy but there's an elective share
 
02:30:42.469 --> 02:30:42.479 align:start position:0%
that a wife can make um against a will
 
02:30:45.990 --> 02:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
um and you know if the person has a will
 
02:30:47.710 --> 02:30:47.720 align:start position:0%
but they just didn't have any assets to
 
02:30:50.070 --> 02:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
probate how does that all how does that
 
02:30:53.630 --> 02:30:53.640 align:start position:0%
all play out um that's not clear and
 
02:30:56.550 --> 02:30:56.560 align:start position:0%
it's pretty mucked up in the way the
 
02:30:56.560 --> 02:31:03.030 align:start position:0%
it's pretty mucked up in the way the
statute's

02:31:03.030 --> 02:31:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:06.510 --> 02:31:06.520 align:start position:0%
written um the last thing is under the
 
02:31:08.830 --> 02:31:08.840 align:start position:0%
Creditor statutes that we have for
 
02:31:13.230 --> 02:31:13.240 align:start position:0%
Estates we have um it's a um common law
 
02:31:15.590 --> 02:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
as um identified by the New Hampshire
 
02:31:18.670 --> 02:31:18.680 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court that we all follow um and
 
02:31:21.750 --> 02:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
it comes follows a new uh US Supreme
 
02:31:24.750 --> 02:31:24.760 align:start position:0%
Court case um and it was something
 
02:31:27.550 --> 02:31:27.560 align:start position:0%
versus Tulsa we call them Tulsa notices
 
02:31:29.790 --> 02:31:29.800 align:start position:0%
so the normal statute limitations for
 
02:31:31.910 --> 02:31:31.920 align:start position:0%
creditors claims is to make those claims
 
02:31:34.389 --> 02:31:34.399 align:start position:0%
within 3 years under our probate
 
02:31:36.510 --> 02:31:36.520 align:start position:0%
statutes as as I discussed earlier we
 
02:31:38.309 --> 02:31:38.319 align:start position:0%
have a short claims period you have to
 
02:31:40.630 --> 02:31:40.640 align:start position:0%
know you have to file the claim with the
 
02:31:42.230 --> 02:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
probate within 6 months of the
 
02:31:43.910 --> 02:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
administrator's appointment and then you
 
02:31:46.030 --> 02:31:46.040 align:start position:0%
have to pursue litigation on your claim
 
02:31:47.950 --> 02:31:47.960 align:start position:0%
Within the following six months if you
 
02:31:49.429 --> 02:31:49.439 align:start position:0%
want to be guaranteed that you're going
 
02:31:50.389 --> 02:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
to get
 
02:31:53.790 --> 02:31:53.800 align:start position:0%
paid we have to send out notices to the
 
02:31:56.670 --> 02:31:56.680 align:start position:0%
creditors to let them know of this short
 
02:31:58.870 --> 02:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
claim statute there's no notice
 
02:32:01.309 --> 02:32:01.319 align:start position:0%
Provisions here to notify creditors of
 
02:32:03.710 --> 02:32:03.720 align:start position:0%
this and I could foresee a creditor
 
02:32:05.990 --> 02:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
saying well I didn't know within the 18
 
02:32:08.710 --> 02:32:08.720 align:start position:0%
months and therefore I get to have an
 
02:32:10.830 --> 02:32:10.840 align:start position:0%
exception here because you've otherwise
 
02:32:13.550 --> 02:32:13.560 align:start position:0%
changed my constitutionally allowed time
 
02:32:15.910 --> 02:32:15.920 align:start position:0%
period in order to bring a claim on the
 
02:32:15.920 --> 02:32:25.230 align:start position:0%
period in order to bring a claim on the
default

02:32:25.230 --> 02:32:25.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:27.870 --> 02:32:27.880 align:start position:0%
debt um I think that's all I have for
 
02:32:30.349 --> 02:32:30.359 align:start position:0%
today and I'm perfectly happy to work
 
02:32:32.429 --> 02:32:32.439 align:start position:0%
with anyone on integrating this because
 
02:32:35.670 --> 02:32:35.680 align:start position:0%
I you know I I don't oppose the um
 
02:32:38.910 --> 02:32:38.920 align:start position:0%
concept but I just think that we're
 
02:32:40.710 --> 02:32:40.720 align:start position:0%
probably creating a bunch of problems
 
02:32:42.990 --> 02:32:43.000 align:start position:0%
unless this gets cleaned up before it
 
02:32:45.510 --> 02:32:45.520 align:start position:0%
goes for a full vote thank you for your
 
02:32:47.910 --> 02:32:47.920 align:start position:0%
testimony questions representative Chase
 
02:32:49.950 --> 02:32:49.960 align:start position:0%
did you have a question thank you thank
 
02:32:52.070 --> 02:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question I'm just
 
02:32:54.870 --> 02:32:54.880 align:start position:0%
curious in the beginning of this the the
 
02:32:56.790 --> 02:32:56.800 align:start position:0%
testimony or it was just said there was
 
02:32:59.510 --> 02:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
no opposing in this past unanimously
 
02:33:01.230 --> 02:33:01.240 align:start position:0%
through the
 
02:33:03.990 --> 02:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
Senate did you testify in front of the
 
02:33:06.389 --> 02:33:06.399 align:start position:0%
senate or any of these other issues were
 
02:33:10.429 --> 02:33:10.439 align:start position:0%
they brought up I I did not um I so I
 
02:33:12.950 --> 02:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
found out about this because um there
 
02:33:15.670 --> 02:33:15.680 align:start position:0%
are a bunch of us um who practice trust
 
02:33:17.990 --> 02:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
in estate law um who have a committee
 
02:33:19.309 --> 02:33:19.319 align:start position:0%
and we keep try to keep track of
 
02:33:21.469 --> 02:33:21.479 align:start position:0%
legislation and sometimes we don't
 
02:33:23.510 --> 02:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
always find out about it when it first
 
02:33:25.710 --> 02:33:25.720 align:start position:0%
comes up but we did find out about it
 
02:33:28.870 --> 02:33:28.880 align:start position:0%
and discussed it and came up
 
02:33:32.190 --> 02:33:32.200 align:start position:0%
today representative
 
02:33:35.790 --> 02:33:35.800 align:start position:0%
Horgan thank you very much um you
 
02:33:37.870 --> 02:33:37.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned the issue of probate being
 
02:33:40.990 --> 02:33:41.000 align:start position:0%
open and I noticed there's a case of
 
02:33:43.590 --> 02:33:43.600 align:start position:0%
well there's a former State rain Andrew
 
02:33:45.590 --> 02:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
Z from from Hampton was her name who
 
02:33:47.550 --> 02:33:47.560 align:start position:0%
died believe in September and I went to
 
02:33:49.190 --> 02:33:49.200 align:start position:0%
her funeral and then I was
 
02:33:52.230 --> 02:33:52.240 align:start position:0%
surprised uh over 6 months later that
 
02:33:54.910 --> 02:33:54.920 align:start position:0%
the notice was just being now put out by
 
02:33:57.110 --> 02:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
uh the probate clerk so is that a
 
02:34:01.429 --> 02:34:01.439 align:start position:0%
unusually is that a um longer than you
 
02:34:03.510 --> 02:34:03.520 align:start position:0%
than typical La for those notices in the
 
02:34:05.550 --> 02:34:05.560 align:start position:0%
newspaper or is that shorter or it
 
02:34:07.389 --> 02:34:07.399 align:start position:0%
certainly is a significant amount of
 
02:34:10.469 --> 02:34:10.479 align:start position:0%
time after after her passing I'm I'm
 
02:34:11.790 --> 02:34:11.800 align:start position:0%
sorry I was having something yeah you
 
02:34:13.750 --> 02:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
might want to take your mask off to just
 
02:34:15.429 --> 02:34:15.439 align:start position:0%
speak into the mic so that you can be
 
02:34:15.439 --> 02:34:17.990 align:start position:0%
speak into the mic so that you can be
understood

02:34:17.990 --> 02:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
understood
 
02:34:20.750 --> 02:34:20.760 align:start position:0%
thank you I just happen to notice U you
 
02:34:23.269 --> 02:34:23.279 align:start position:0%
know the one of the processes in Probate
 
02:34:25.590 --> 02:34:25.600 align:start position:0%
is uh they put a notices in the
 
02:34:27.630 --> 02:34:27.640 align:start position:0%
newspaper typically in the back pages of
 
02:34:29.469 --> 02:34:29.479 align:start position:0%
the of the union leader here in New
 
02:34:32.670 --> 02:34:32.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so I noticed just uh a former
 
02:34:34.910 --> 02:34:34.920 align:start position:0%
colleague of mine who died over six
 
02:34:36.830 --> 02:34:36.840 align:start position:0%
months ago her notice was just published
 
02:34:39.550 --> 02:34:39.560 align:start position:0%
a few days ago so is that a uh and
 
02:34:41.670 --> 02:34:41.680 align:start position:0%
that's a signific amount of time so that
 
02:34:44.950 --> 02:34:44.960 align:start position:0%
is that um is that about uh is that
 
02:34:47.710 --> 02:34:47.720 align:start position:0%
about average for uh the gap between
 
02:34:50.030 --> 02:34:50.040 align:start position:0%
when the person dies and when the uh
 
02:34:52.590 --> 02:34:52.600 align:start position:0%
probate process is opened or is it
 
02:34:54.830 --> 02:34:54.840 align:start position:0%
usually shorter or perhaps even
 
02:34:59.870 --> 02:34:59.880 align:start position:0%
longer it it can be shorter longer um it
 
02:35:03.510 --> 02:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
just you know grief is difficult and it
 
02:35:07.150 --> 02:35:07.160 align:start position:0%
is individual and um you know sometimes
 
02:35:09.790 --> 02:35:09.800 align:start position:0%
there's a need to open it up quickly
 
02:35:11.110 --> 02:35:11.120 align:start position:0%
sometimes people want to get it done and
 
02:35:14.190 --> 02:35:14.200 align:start position:0%
over with sometimes people are so pained
 
02:35:16.710 --> 02:35:16.720 align:start position:0%
that they want to put it off it it
 
02:35:19.710 --> 02:35:19.720 align:start position:0%
really is depend you know I think most
 
02:35:23.590 --> 02:35:23.600 align:start position:0%
people get to it pretty quickly um but
 
02:35:26.230 --> 02:35:26.240 align:start position:0%
it really depends on the
 
02:35:30.110 --> 02:35:30.120 align:start position:0%
individual thank you you have a followup
 
02:35:33.230 --> 02:35:33.240 align:start position:0%
yes and I guess the purpose of those
 
02:35:35.230 --> 02:35:35.240 align:start position:0%
notices is um just in case one of the
 
02:35:38.429 --> 02:35:38.439 align:start position:0%
purpos notices is just in case um a
 
02:35:40.630 --> 02:35:40.640 align:start position:0%
deceased person owes you money you at
 
02:35:42.429 --> 02:35:42.439 align:start position:0%
least have a theoretical chance of
 
02:35:44.190 --> 02:35:44.200 align:start position:0%
seeing in the newspaper and being able
 
02:35:48.389 --> 02:35:48.399 align:start position:0%
to file a claim so uh would there be is
 
02:35:51.190 --> 02:35:51.200 align:start position:0%
that was it would it would you be losing
 
02:35:54.750 --> 02:35:54.760 align:start position:0%
that protection if uh we if the if we if
 
02:35:57.349 --> 02:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
we uh adopted this transfer and deed act
 
02:35:57.359 --> 02:35:58.150 align:start position:0%
we uh adopted this transfer and deed act
as

02:35:58.150 --> 02:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
as
 
02:36:01.750 --> 02:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
is I I don't know that there are
 
02:36:05.150 --> 02:36:05.160 align:start position:0%
creditors who peruse the notices that
 
02:36:08.469 --> 02:36:08.479 align:start position:0%
are filed by the probate courts to see
 
02:36:12.230 --> 02:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
who has died I I just I don't think that
 
02:36:14.950 --> 02:36:14.960 align:start position:0%
that is sufficient notice to a creditor
 
02:36:17.110 --> 02:36:17.120 align:start position:0%
to require them to be bound by that
 
02:36:20.510 --> 02:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:24.349 --> 02:36:24.359 align:start position:0%

02:37:46.349 --> 02:37:46.359 align:start position:0%
the sponsor of Senate bill
 
02:37:51.230 --> 02:37:51.240 align:start position:0%
344 which has has to do with uh virtual
 
02:37:55.110 --> 02:37:55.120 align:start position:0%
meetings I think we we do what we can uh
 
02:37:57.990 --> 02:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
in these Chambers to gain more
 
02:38:00.830 --> 02:38:00.840 align:start position:0%
participation in public affairs uh
 
02:38:03.630 --> 02:38:03.640 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 344 is an invitation to the
 
02:38:06.349 --> 02:38:06.359 align:start position:0%
public to better know what goes on in
 
02:38:08.990 --> 02:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
the political subdivisions of the state
 
02:38:12.150 --> 02:38:12.160 align:start position:0%
it does not pertain to the general court
 
02:38:14.870 --> 02:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
first and foremost this bill is enabling
 
02:38:14.880 --> 02:38:16.349 align:start position:0%
first and foremost this bill is enabling
legislation

02:38:16.349 --> 02:38:16.359 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
02:38:18.950 --> 02:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
something this body has historically
 
02:38:21.750 --> 02:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
supported it enables the legislative
 
02:38:24.309 --> 02:38:24.319 align:start position:0%
body to decide whether or not they wish
 
02:38:26.469 --> 02:38:26.479 align:start position:0%
to allow their governing boards to meet
 
02:38:28.750 --> 02:38:28.760 align:start position:0%
virtually with the stipulation that
 
02:38:31.429 --> 02:38:31.439 align:start position:0%
there must be at least a quarter of the
 
02:38:34.070 --> 02:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
governing board physically present at a
 
02:38:37.309 --> 02:38:37.319 align:start position:0%
specified location open to the
 
02:38:40.070 --> 02:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
public it's an Undisputed fact that over
 
02:38:42.750 --> 02:38:42.760 align:start position:0%
the past couple years the use of virtual
 
02:38:45.190 --> 02:38:45.200 align:start position:0%
meetings has increased public
 
02:38:47.750 --> 02:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
participation ation in local meetings
 
02:38:49.990 --> 02:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
given greater opportunity for the public
 
02:38:53.070 --> 02:38:53.080 align:start position:0%
to watch their elected officials perform
 
02:38:55.190 --> 02:38:55.200 align:start position:0%
their duties and interactively
 
02:38:58.190 --> 02:38:58.200 align:start position:0%
communicate with them last year we
 
02:38:59.950 --> 02:38:59.960 align:start position:0%
passed House Bill
 
02:39:02.630 --> 02:39:02.640 align:start position:0%
108 that bill authorized virtual
 
02:39:05.269 --> 02:39:05.279 align:start position:0%
meetings but there was later changed to
 
02:39:07.070 --> 02:39:07.080 align:start position:0%
a study
 
02:39:09.429 --> 02:39:09.439 align:start position:0%
committee out of that study committee
 
02:39:11.590 --> 02:39:11.600 align:start position:0%
came a number of references that are
 
02:39:15.710 --> 02:39:15.720 align:start position:0%
built into this this bill before you and
 
02:39:17.630 --> 02:39:17.640 align:start position:0%
including that a physical location
 
02:39:18.950 --> 02:39:18.960 align:start position:0%
remain a
 
02:39:22.190 --> 02:39:22.200 align:start position:0%
requirement that a minimum of a quarter
 
02:39:24.230 --> 02:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
of the board shall be physically present
 
02:39:25.790 --> 02:39:25.800 align:start position:0%
at that
 
02:39:28.550 --> 02:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
location that remote participation for
 
02:39:30.670 --> 02:39:30.680 align:start position:0%
members should be allowed in
 
02:39:30.680 --> 02:39:31.990 align:start position:0%
members should be allowed in
non-emergency

02:39:31.990 --> 02:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
non-emergency
 
02:39:34.550 --> 02:39:34.560 align:start position:0%
situations with
 
02:39:37.830 --> 02:39:37.840 align:start position:0%
restraint that the quote not reasonably
 
02:39:40.830 --> 02:39:40.840 align:start position:0%
practical standard for remote
 
02:39:43.630 --> 02:39:43.640 align:start position:0%
participation with Doc documenting such
 
02:39:46.269 --> 02:39:46.279 align:start position:0%
reason in the minutes should
 
02:39:49.070 --> 02:39:49.080 align:start position:0%
remain that all votes taken in a virtual
 
02:39:51.710 --> 02:39:51.720 align:start position:0%
meeting shall be by roll call
 
02:39:54.590 --> 02:39:54.600 align:start position:0%
vote that instructions on how the public
 
02:39:57.309 --> 02:39:57.319 align:start position:0%
can access the meeting be included in
 
02:40:00.590 --> 02:40:00.600 align:start position:0%
the meeting notice along with the means
 
02:40:03.710 --> 02:40:03.720 align:start position:0%
by which the public can notify the body
 
02:40:06.670 --> 02:40:06.680 align:start position:0%
if transmission to the public is
 
02:40:09.269 --> 02:40:09.279 align:start position:0%
interrupted and that in the event of
 
02:40:11.150 --> 02:40:11.160 align:start position:0%
interruption the meeting shall be
 
02:40:14.349 --> 02:40:14.359 align:start position:0%
adjourned until the public is able to
 
02:40:16.230 --> 02:40:16.240 align:start position:0%
access the meeting
 
02:40:18.750 --> 02:40:18.760 align:start position:0%
these record these recommendations are
 
02:40:21.750 --> 02:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
contained with with the bill along with
 
02:40:24.070 --> 02:40:24.080 align:start position:0%
the additional requirement that a
 
02:40:26.950 --> 02:40:26.960 align:start position:0%
virtually participating member must have
 
02:40:30.349 --> 02:40:30.359 align:start position:0%
his or her camera actively displaying
 
02:40:31.830 --> 02:40:31.840 align:start position:0%
the member's
 
02:40:34.389 --> 02:40:34.399 align:start position:0%
face it's time that we let the local
 
02:40:37.190 --> 02:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
community decide whether or not they
 
02:40:40.190 --> 02:40:40.200 align:start position:0%
consider virtual meetings beneficial in
 
02:40:41.870 --> 02:40:41.880 align:start position:0%
understanding how their local government
 
02:40:44.110 --> 02:40:44.120 align:start position:0%
operates and to that regard I
 
02:40:45.550 --> 02:40:45.560 align:start position:0%
respectfully ask that you support
 
02:40:48.630 --> 02:40:48.640 align:start position:0%

so uh I am rising in support of SB 344 I
 
02:41:24.870 --> 02:41:24.880 align:start position:0%
had a digital meetings bill as well SP
 
02:41:28.830 --> 02:41:28.840 align:start position:0%
322 and Senator Daniels and I decided to
 
02:41:30.990 --> 02:41:31.000 align:start position:0%
combine our bills and work together on
 
02:41:33.990 --> 02:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
this version um that is in front of you
 
02:41:36.710 --> 02:41:36.720 align:start position:0%
today as we all saw firsthand during the
 
02:41:38.710 --> 02:41:38.720 align:start position:0%
end of the 2020 legislative session in
 
02:41:40.269 --> 02:41:40.279 align:start position:0%
the entirety of
 
02:41:43.670 --> 02:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
2021 remote access to meetings provides
 
02:41:46.349 --> 02:41:46.359 align:start position:0%
a wealth of benefits more people can
 
02:41:47.910 --> 02:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
participate in hearings and have their
 
02:41:50.110 --> 02:41:50.120 align:start position:0%
voices heard people with differing
 
02:41:52.230 --> 02:41:52.240 align:start position:0%
abilities and health are ensured access
 
02:41:54.550 --> 02:41:54.560 align:start position:0%
without concern and more elected
 
02:41:56.150 --> 02:41:56.160 align:start position:0%
officials can be the voice that their
 
02:41:58.070 --> 02:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
constituents elected them to be without
 
02:42:00.389 --> 02:42:00.399 align:start position:0%
worry worrying that employment Child
 
02:42:02.830 --> 02:42:02.840 align:start position:0%
Care Transportation will simply be a bar
 
02:42:05.790 --> 02:42:05.800 align:start position:0%
to them holding office towns can save
 
02:42:07.630 --> 02:42:07.640 align:start position:0%
Administration and staff cost and better
 
02:42:09.510 --> 02:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
serve their residents it's a local
 
02:42:12.830 --> 02:42:12.840 align:start position:0%
control issue as well I've worked very
 
02:42:14.710 --> 02:42:14.720 align:start position:0%
closely with my friends from districts
 
02:42:16.750 --> 02:42:16.760 align:start position:0%
10 and 11 to craft an amendment that
 
02:42:19.190 --> 02:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
will Empower local communities to vote
 
02:42:22.910 --> 02:42:22.920 align:start position:0%
to allow digital meetings as passed by
 
02:42:25.670 --> 02:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
the Senate this bill leaves 91a
 
02:42:29.070 --> 02:42:29.080 align:start position:0%
completely intact as it exists today and
 
02:42:31.230 --> 02:42:31.240 align:start position:0%
then simply adds a new section on the
 
02:42:33.870 --> 02:42:33.880 align:start position:0%
end which allows a vote by the
 
02:42:36.590 --> 02:42:36.600 align:start position:0%
legislative body of municipalities to
 
02:42:38.750 --> 02:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
expand access to remote
 
02:42:41.870 --> 02:42:41.880 align:start position:0%
meetings as Senator Daniels mentioned
 
02:42:44.110 --> 02:42:44.120 align:start position:0%
there are some parameters around how a
 
02:42:46.110 --> 02:42:46.120 align:start position:0%
municipality can expand and local
 
02:42:48.870 --> 02:42:48.880 align:start position:0%
meetings including having a quarter of
 
02:42:52.309 --> 02:42:52.319 align:start position:0%
the board physically present um making
 
02:42:54.150 --> 02:42:54.160 align:start position:0%
sure that if the public is unable to
 
02:42:55.830 --> 02:42:55.840 align:start position:0%
access the meeting due to a problem with
 
02:42:57.710 --> 02:42:57.720 align:start position:0%
the host that the meeting is adjourned
 
02:43:00.469 --> 02:43:00.479 align:start position:0%
until that access is restored and that
 
02:43:02.750 --> 02:43:02.760 align:start position:0%
all meetings held remotely must display
 
02:43:05.870 --> 02:43:05.880 align:start position:0%
a member's face and and take a roll call
 
02:43:09.070 --> 02:43:09.080 align:start position:0%
vote however it will provide an option
 
02:43:11.030 --> 02:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
to municipalities to ensure that we're
 
02:43:13.790 --> 02:43:13.800 align:start position:0%
not forcing digital or remote meetings
 
02:43:15.550 --> 02:43:15.560 align:start position:0%
in situations where municipalities may
 
02:43:17.790 --> 02:43:17.800 align:start position:0%
not want them but we're also allowing
 
02:43:19.510 --> 02:43:19.520 align:start position:0%
them for communities where this makes
 
02:43:21.309 --> 02:43:21.319 align:start position:0%
sense and where it can encourage
 
02:43:24.309 --> 02:43:24.319 align:start position:0%
diversity of participation um by members
 
02:43:25.710 --> 02:43:25.720 align:start position:0%
of our public
 
02:43:28.269 --> 02:43:28.279 align:start position:0%
bodies it is our opinion here in the
 
02:43:30.230 --> 02:43:30.240 align:start position:0%
Senate that this issue does not need
 
02:43:32.469 --> 02:43:32.479 align:start position:0%
further study that we've all lived
 
02:43:34.469 --> 02:43:34.479 align:start position:0%
through this experience to great success
 
02:43:36.190 --> 02:43:36.200 align:start position:0%
and we'd love to enable our towns and
 
02:43:37.590 --> 02:43:37.600 align:start position:0%
cities to
 
02:43:39.950 --> 02:43:39.960 align:start position:0%
continue thank you Mr chairman I'm happy
 
02:43:41.710 --> 02:43:41.720 align:start position:0%
to take any questions are there
 
02:43:43.710 --> 02:43:43.720 align:start position:0%
questions for the senator yes
 
02:43:45.750 --> 02:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
representative wper uh thank you Mr
 
02:43:47.190 --> 02:43:47.200 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
02:43:49.790 --> 02:43:49.800 align:start position:0%
question uh the Bill calls for a quarter
 
02:43:52.510 --> 02:43:52.520 align:start position:0%
of the total membership to be present at
 
02:43:54.550 --> 02:43:54.560 align:start position:0%
the physical location does that have any
 
02:43:56.790 --> 02:43:56.800 align:start position:0%
relationship to the Quorum
 
02:43:59.030 --> 02:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
requirement it does not the Quorum
 
02:44:01.630 --> 02:44:01.640 align:start position:0%
requirement can still be set pursuant to
 
02:44:01.640 --> 02:44:03.630 align:start position:0%
requirement can still be set pursuant to
local

02:44:03.630 --> 02:44:03.640 align:start position:0%
local
 
02:44:07.710 --> 02:44:07.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:10.510 --> 02:44:10.520 align:start position:0%
followup remote participation
 
02:44:14.190 --> 02:44:14.200 align:start position:0%
participants shall have their video
 
02:44:14.200 --> 02:44:15.910 align:start position:0%
participants shall have their video
on

02:44:15.910 --> 02:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:44:17.710 --> 02:44:17.720 align:start position:0%
does that mean that in areas without
 
02:44:20.510 --> 02:44:20.520 align:start position:0%
good Broadband they can't conduct remote
 
02:44:23.190 --> 02:44:23.200 align:start position:0%
meetings so I think it's something that
 
02:44:25.870 --> 02:44:25.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities will have to consider but
 
02:44:29.910 --> 02:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
in the Senate um the discussion was that
 
02:44:32.349 --> 02:44:32.359 align:start position:0%
we want to ensure that if remote
 
02:44:35.190 --> 02:44:35.200 align:start position:0%
meetings are to continue that they are
 
02:44:38.190 --> 02:44:38.200 align:start position:0%
always in the spirit that you know we we
 
02:44:40.870 --> 02:44:40.880 align:start position:0%
do the best discussing when we can see
 
02:44:42.870 --> 02:44:42.880 align:start position:0%
each other when we can talk and make eye
 
02:44:44.710 --> 02:44:44.720 align:start position:0%
contact that our elected officials are
 
02:44:48.030 --> 02:44:48.040 align:start position:0%
available to us and so that was a a
 
02:44:50.550 --> 02:44:50.560 align:start position:0%
bipartisan compromise to make sure that
 
02:44:53.349 --> 02:44:53.359 align:start position:0%
this bill you know reflected as um a
 
02:44:55.830 --> 02:44:55.840 align:start position:0%
broad opinion as we
 
02:45:00.190 --> 02:45:00.200 align:start position:0%
could and a followup so
 
02:45:03.030 --> 02:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
you the bill requires that if there are
 
02:45:06.110 --> 02:45:06.120 align:start position:0%
problems with electronic access that the
 
02:45:07.230 --> 02:45:07.240 align:start position:0%
meeting be
 
02:45:10.590 --> 02:45:10.600 align:start position:0%
postponed won't that create substantial
 
02:45:13.110 --> 02:45:13.120 align:start position:0%
difficulties for the board or whatever
 
02:45:15.230 --> 02:45:15.240 align:start position:0%
that's meeting in terms of scheduling
 
02:45:15.240 --> 02:45:16.670 align:start position:0%
that's meeting in terms of scheduling
meeting

02:45:16.670 --> 02:45:16.680 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
02:45:20.630 --> 02:45:20.640 align:start position:0%
deadlines um again this is purely adding
 
02:45:22.710 --> 02:45:22.720 align:start position:0%
an option so it's a choice by
 
02:45:25.230 --> 02:45:25.240 align:start position:0%
municipality to
 
02:45:29.110 --> 02:45:29.120 align:start position:0%
say you know we think that this remote
 
02:45:30.750 --> 02:45:30.760 align:start position:0%
style of meeting and and making it
 
02:45:32.990 --> 02:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
available is important to us enough that
 
02:45:36.510 --> 02:45:36.520 align:start position:0%
we can accommodate um you know sort of
 
02:45:38.870 --> 02:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
the public notice and Public Access
 
02:45:42.750 --> 02:45:42.760 align:start position:0%
aspects of it so in our mind um we
 
02:45:45.110 --> 02:45:45.120 align:start position:0%
limited to that adjournment to when
 
02:45:46.870 --> 02:45:46.880 align:start position:0%
there are problems with the host or the
 
02:45:49.389 --> 02:45:49.399 align:start position:0%
broadcaster it it surely does not
 
02:45:53.910 --> 02:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
include um I can't get my zoom to work
 
02:45:57.910 --> 02:45:57.920 align:start position:0%
so uh you know we wanted to to make sure
 
02:45:59.790 --> 02:45:59.800 align:start position:0%
that it's it's in a limited situation
 
02:46:01.429 --> 02:46:01.439 align:start position:0%
but that you know the public being able
 
02:46:04.950 --> 02:46:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:08.670 --> 02:46:08.680 align:start position:0%
piece we all set yep and there are there
 
02:46:10.590 --> 02:46:10.600 align:start position:0%
other questions for the senator
 
02:46:13.070 --> 02:46:13.080 align:start position:0%
representative mlan just a quick
 
02:46:15.550 --> 02:46:15.560 align:start position:0%
question Senator with respect to scope
 
02:46:18.349 --> 02:46:18.359 align:start position:0%
a political subdivision that doesn't
 
02:46:20.790 --> 02:46:20.800 align:start position:0%
bind the that go to the legislature as
 
02:46:23.550 --> 02:46:23.560 align:start position:0%
well or if that's not legislature that's
 
02:46:26.870 --> 02:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
just cities towns boards Etc that's
 
02:46:28.309 --> 02:46:28.319 align:start position:0%
right thank you for the clarification
 
02:46:30.190 --> 02:46:30.200 align:start position:0%
representative representative so there
 
02:46:33.070 --> 02:46:33.080 align:start position:0%
is a specific line in there just to
 
02:46:35.429 --> 02:46:35.439 align:start position:0%
avoid any ambiguity that this bill does
 
02:46:37.510 --> 02:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
not apply to the general court it is
 
02:46:41.150 --> 02:46:41.160 align:start position:0%
simply towns cities counties and other
 
02:46:47.710 --> 02:46:47.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:49.950 --> 02:46:49.960 align:start position:0%
I think prompted mostly by the community
 
02:46:53.349 --> 02:46:53.359 align:start position:0%
power Coalition of their ability to to
 
02:46:56.230 --> 02:46:56.240 align:start position:0%
use this bill um to hold remote meetings
 
02:46:59.349 --> 02:46:59.359 align:start position:0%
and so to do that um we would need an
 
02:47:01.030 --> 02:47:01.040 align:start position:0%
amendment to the current language to
 
02:47:03.469 --> 02:47:03.479 align:start position:0%
include instrumentalities created under
 
02:47:06.309 --> 02:47:06.319 align:start position:0%
RSA 53a um which I'm happy to talk to
 
02:47:08.429 --> 02:47:08.439 align:start position:0%
you further about but just to answer
 
02:47:10.590 --> 02:47:10.600 align:start position:0%
your specific question it does not apply
 
02:47:12.190 --> 02:47:12.200 align:start position:0%
to the general
 
02:47:15.309 --> 02:47:15.319 align:start position:0%
court thank you other question questions
 
02:47:15.319 --> 02:47:18.910 align:start position:0%
court thank you other question questions
representative

02:47:18.910 --> 02:47:18.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:21.990 --> 02:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
Horgan yes the way I read this this
 
02:47:24.750 --> 02:47:24.760 align:start position:0%
seems to put put an end to a practice
 
02:47:28.550 --> 02:47:28.560 align:start position:0%
which was uh not well somewhat common
 
02:47:31.070 --> 02:47:31.080 align:start position:0%
long before the pandemic came along and
 
02:47:33.110 --> 02:47:33.120 align:start position:0%
we started having Zoom meetings and uh
 
02:47:35.309 --> 02:47:35.319 align:start position:0%
which was occasionally you would have a
 
02:47:37.950 --> 02:47:37.960 align:start position:0%
member participating in a uh
 
02:47:40.269 --> 02:47:40.279 align:start position:0%
participating in the hearing by uh by
 
02:47:42.349 --> 02:47:42.359 align:start position:0%
speaker phone so that would no
 
02:47:44.389 --> 02:47:44.399 align:start position:0%
longer um that would no longer be
 
02:47:47.070 --> 02:47:47.080 align:start position:0%
allowed if this bill passes since the
 
02:47:48.670 --> 02:47:48.680 align:start position:0%
speaker phone doesn't show the picture
 
02:47:51.670 --> 02:47:51.680 align:start position:0%
of the person who's speaking it's a very
 
02:47:54.950 --> 02:47:54.960 align:start position:0%
good question representative so
 
02:47:58.309 --> 02:47:58.319 align:start position:0%
um I am not here to provide legal advice
 
02:48:00.030 --> 02:48:00.040 align:start position:0%
on it the existing
 
02:48:04.670 --> 02:48:04.680 align:start position:0%
91a would remain intact exactly as it is
 
02:48:07.309 --> 02:48:07.319 align:start position:0%
if a municipality voted through its
 
02:48:09.670 --> 02:48:09.680 align:start position:0%
legislative body under this new section
 
02:48:14.030 --> 02:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
to expand the use of digital meetings um
 
02:48:16.389 --> 02:48:16.399 align:start position:0%
then pursuant to that section it would
 
02:48:20.590 --> 02:48:20.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:24.389 --> 02:48:24.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:27.429 --> 02:48:27.439 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you Senator

good morning Mr chairman and members of

the committee my name is Karen Leo Hill

I am the Grafton County Treasurer um but
 
02:48:58.309 --> 02:48:58.319 align:start position:0%
more importantly for the purposes today
 
02:49:00.790 --> 02:49:00.800 align:start position:0%
I'm an 18-year city counselor from the
 
02:49:04.309 --> 02:49:04.319 align:start position:0%
city of Lebanon I am here um because
 
02:49:08.150 --> 02:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
over the past 18 years I have seen the
 
02:49:13.710 --> 02:49:13.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:15.910 --> 02:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
with can you hear me
 
02:49:15.920 --> 02:49:17.670 align:start position:0%

02:49:17.670 --> 02:49:17.680 align:start position:0%
better
 
02:49:20.429 --> 02:49:20.439 align:start position:0%
okay my name is Karen Leo Hill I'm an
 
02:49:22.349 --> 02:49:22.359 align:start position:0%
18-year City councelor in the city of
 
02:49:25.030 --> 02:49:25.040 align:start position:0%
Lebanon and happy to be with you today
 
02:49:27.269 --> 02:49:27.279 align:start position:0%
and in support of SB
 
02:49:30.190 --> 02:49:30.200 align:start position:0%
344 over 18 years I have certainly seen
 
02:49:32.710 --> 02:49:32.720 align:start position:0%
the struggles that we have with uh
 
02:49:36.630 --> 02:49:36.640 align:start position:0%
participation in public meetings and it
 
02:49:38.750 --> 02:49:38.760 align:start position:0%
has been one of the Silver Linings over
 
02:49:42.190 --> 02:49:42.200 align:start position:0%
the last two years that remote meetings
 
02:49:44.870 --> 02:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
have enabled more people to participate
 
02:49:47.670 --> 02:49:47.680 align:start position:0%
at more frequently and I believe that
 
02:49:50.830 --> 02:49:50.840 align:start position:0%
actually our democracy has been
 
02:49:53.790 --> 02:49:53.800 align:start position:0%
strengthened because technology has been
 
02:49:57.389 --> 02:49:57.399 align:start position:0%
deployed in such a successful way I
 
02:49:59.030 --> 02:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
believe that s SP
 
02:50:02.429 --> 02:50:02.439 align:start position:0%
344 is truly a path forward that will
 
02:50:04.630 --> 02:50:04.640 align:start position:0%
allow this greater level of
 
02:50:08.030 --> 02:50:08.040 align:start position:0%
participation while safeguarding our
 
02:50:10.190 --> 02:50:10.200 align:start position:0%
democracy things that are important to
 
02:50:13.630 --> 02:50:13.640 align:start position:0%
us deliberation the ability to engage
 
02:50:16.910 --> 02:50:16.920 align:start position:0%
with one another about different issues
 
02:50:18.790 --> 02:50:18.800 align:start position:0%
as a member of the city council over the
 
02:50:21.870 --> 02:50:21.880 align:start position:0%
last two years I have observed firsthand
 
02:50:24.750 --> 02:50:24.760 align:start position:0%
that we have been able to Grapple with
 
02:50:27.870 --> 02:50:27.880 align:start position:0%
discussions with issues even sometimes
 
02:50:31.429 --> 02:50:31.439 align:start position:0%
very controversial issues such as a
 
02:50:35.870 --> 02:50:35.880 align:start position:0%
proposal to um to uh defund the police
 
02:50:39.229 --> 02:50:39.239 align:start position:0%
department by 50% so we have engaged in
 
02:50:42.389 --> 02:50:42.399 align:start position:0%
some very tense controversial
 
02:50:44.870 --> 02:50:44.880 align:start position:0%
discussions we have been able to have
 
02:50:48.030 --> 02:50:48.040 align:start position:0%
that deliberation that was important to
 
02:50:50.389 --> 02:50:50.399 align:start position:0%
truly reflect what the people of Lebanon
 
02:50:53.190 --> 02:50:53.200 align:start position:0%
wanted and to be able to make decisions
 
02:50:55.750 --> 02:50:55.760 align:start position:0%
that represented many
 
02:50:59.790 --> 02:50:59.800 align:start position:0%
voices so we've been able to have
 
02:51:02.150 --> 02:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
deliberation I can recall back I'll make
 
02:51:05.030 --> 02:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
this very um practical I can recall back
 
02:51:07.110 --> 02:51:07.120 align:start position:0%
16 years ago when I was pregnant with my
 
02:51:09.510 --> 02:51:09.520 align:start position:0%
younger child and there were times when
 
02:51:12.630 --> 02:51:12.640 align:start position:0%
at the end of a long day I was just too
 
02:51:15.710 --> 02:51:15.720 align:start position:0%
tired my ankles were too too swollen to
 
02:51:18.110 --> 02:51:18.120 align:start position:0%
sit through a three or a 4-Hour city
 
02:51:20.830 --> 02:51:20.840 align:start position:0%
council meeting and unfortunately I had
 
02:51:22.870 --> 02:51:22.880 align:start position:0%
to make the choice sometimes to stay
 
02:51:25.910 --> 02:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
home having the ability to participate
 
02:51:29.389 --> 02:51:29.399 align:start position:0%
remotely would have benefited me and I
 
02:51:30.950 --> 02:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
believe would have been would have
 
02:51:33.389 --> 02:51:33.399 align:start position:0%
benefited the constituents who elected
 
02:51:36.269 --> 02:51:36.279 align:start position:0%
me and I would have if this legislation
 
02:51:38.229 --> 02:51:38.239 align:start position:0%
had been in place at the time and the
 
02:51:40.309 --> 02:51:40.319 align:start position:0%
technology had been in place at the time
 
02:51:42.590 --> 02:51:42.600 align:start position:0%
which I don't know if it was uh I would
 
02:51:44.710 --> 02:51:44.720 align:start position:0%
have been able to continue in the the
 
02:51:46.590 --> 02:51:46.600 align:start position:0%
public service that I had been elected
 
02:51:50.229 --> 02:51:50.239 align:start position:0%
to do um while attending to my health
 
02:51:52.750 --> 02:51:52.760 align:start position:0%
concerns I think the same would apply to
 
02:51:55.309 --> 02:51:55.319 align:start position:0%
people recovering from knee replacement
 
02:51:58.389 --> 02:51:58.399 align:start position:0%
surgery or um hip replacement surgery
 
02:52:02.269 --> 02:52:02.279 align:start position:0%
for example as well and so in summary I
 
02:52:04.950 --> 02:52:04.960 align:start position:0%
would just ask that you consider
 
02:52:07.469 --> 02:52:07.479 align:start position:0%
supporting this legislation I believe
 
02:52:10.830 --> 02:52:10.840 align:start position:0%
that it is good for democracy it is good
 
02:52:13.630 --> 02:52:13.640 align:start position:0%
for public participation it is good for
 
02:52:15.670 --> 02:52:15.680 align:start position:0%
public service
 
02:52:18.269 --> 02:52:18.279 align:start position:0%
while also safeguarding the most
 
02:52:21.630 --> 02:52:21.640 align:start position:0%
important parts uh and traditions of New
 
02:52:24.030 --> 02:52:24.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire democracy being
 
02:52:26.750 --> 02:52:26.760 align:start position:0%
deliberation as well as having a
 
02:52:28.550 --> 02:52:28.560 align:start position:0%
physical space where a member of the
 
02:52:32.349 --> 02:52:32.359 align:start position:0%
public can come if they are not able or
 
02:52:34.790 --> 02:52:34.800 align:start position:0%
interested in participating remotely so
 
02:52:37.910 --> 02:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
by having the physical presence that is
 
02:52:41.030 --> 02:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
an important Safeguard by having
 
02:52:44.150 --> 02:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
the uh the the only issue I would say is
 
02:52:47.550 --> 02:52:47.560 align:start position:0%
the video on I think until we truly have
 
02:52:49.910 --> 02:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
Broadband ubiquitous Broadband in the
 
02:52:51.550 --> 02:52:51.560 align:start position:0%
state sometimes you have to keep your
 
02:52:54.349 --> 02:52:54.359 align:start position:0%
video off to maintain the connection so
 
02:52:56.950 --> 02:52:56.960 align:start position:0%
if if anyone was open to an amendment I
 
02:52:58.510 --> 02:52:58.520 align:start position:0%
might consider that would be the only
 
02:53:01.030 --> 02:53:01.040 align:start position:0%
area that I think an amendment might be
 
02:53:03.830 --> 02:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
prudent um but overall I think this is a
 
02:53:07.550 --> 02:53:07.560 align:start position:0%
bill that safeguards democracy honors
 
02:53:09.550 --> 02:53:09.560 align:start position:0%
the best of our Traditions here in New
 
02:53:13.630 --> 02:53:13.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but does move forward uh in
 
02:53:15.550 --> 02:53:15.560 align:start position:0%
allowing Tech techology to support us in
 
02:53:18.590 --> 02:53:18.600 align:start position:0%
our efforts thank you very much are
 
02:53:21.389 --> 02:53:21.399 align:start position:0%
there questions from Miss
 
02:53:24.750 --> 02:53:24.760 align:start position:0%
Hill representative mlan thank you Mr
 
02:53:26.030 --> 02:53:26.040 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
02:53:28.750 --> 02:53:28.760 align:start position:0%
question just in in your experience you
 
02:53:31.070 --> 02:53:31.080 align:start position:0%
know being a part of meetings for 18
 
02:53:34.950 --> 02:53:34.960 align:start position:0%
years um the the legislation says that
 
02:53:37.710 --> 02:53:37.720 align:start position:0%
you have to attend in person unless
 
02:53:41.469 --> 02:53:41.479 align:start position:0%
there is a reason that is you cannot for
 
02:53:44.190 --> 02:53:44.200 align:start position:0%
unless it's not reasonably practicable
 
02:53:46.750 --> 02:53:46.760 align:start position:0%
so so in your experience 18 years of
 
02:53:49.150 --> 02:53:49.160 align:start position:0%
public meetings where would you draw the
 
02:53:51.150 --> 02:53:51.160 align:start position:0%
line um you mentioned the person who's
 
02:53:52.990 --> 02:53:53.000 align:start position:0%
got knee surgery obviously they're bad
 
02:53:56.790 --> 02:53:56.800 align:start position:0%
written um but where would you draw that
 
02:54:02.429 --> 02:54:02.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:04.790 --> 02:54:04.800 align:start position:0%
um I think it's a good question
 
02:54:06.429 --> 02:54:06.439 align:start position:0%
obviously there's a certain amount of
 
02:54:07.950 --> 02:54:07.960 align:start position:0%
subjectivity in there but the word
 
02:54:11.630 --> 02:54:11.640 align:start position:0%
reasonable is used throughout law and
 
02:54:13.190 --> 02:54:13.200 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of litigation around what
 
02:54:14.790 --> 02:54:14.800 align:start position:0%
reasonable is
 
02:54:19.510 --> 02:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
um I think the spirit of the legislation
 
02:54:23.030 --> 02:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
is clear that in person is preferable so
 
02:54:25.070 --> 02:54:25.080 align:start position:0%
there's a preference for being in person
 
02:54:27.750 --> 02:54:27.760 align:start position:0%
and I think when people are elected we
 
02:54:31.389 --> 02:54:31.399 align:start position:0%
take our jobs very seriously and I think
 
02:54:33.870 --> 02:54:33.880 align:start position:0%
it certainly is my preference to be in
 
02:54:37.790 --> 02:54:37.800 align:start position:0%
person when I can and so I would expect
 
02:54:41.190 --> 02:54:41.200 align:start position:0%
that people would interpret it in
 
02:54:44.990 --> 02:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
a rather restrictive way that
 
02:54:48.309 --> 02:54:48.319 align:start position:0%
reasonableness would would be things
 
02:54:50.150 --> 02:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
that have to do with health things that
 
02:54:52.429 --> 02:54:52.439 align:start position:0%
have to do with physical accessibility
 
02:54:55.110 --> 02:54:55.120 align:start position:0%
if someone is thinking that they may be
 
02:54:56.990 --> 02:54:57.000 align:start position:0%
exhibiting symptoms of something that
 
02:54:58.389 --> 02:54:58.399 align:start position:0%
they would like to be careful about
 
02:55:00.389 --> 02:55:00.399 align:start position:0%
spreading I would assume it would apply
 
02:55:02.710 --> 02:55:02.720 align:start position:0%
to something like that I don't think
 
02:55:07.229 --> 02:55:07.239 align:start position:0%
that it would apply to saying oh I I
 
02:55:09.830 --> 02:55:09.840 align:start position:0%
Have a scheduling conflict and I have to
 
02:55:11.349 --> 02:55:11.359 align:start position:0%
prioritize this other meeting I don't
 
02:55:13.429 --> 02:55:13.439 align:start position:0%
think that would be to me that wouldn't
 
02:55:14.870 --> 02:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
be reasonable I think when you're a
 
02:55:17.389 --> 02:55:17.399 align:start position:0%
public servant you know that's part of
 
02:55:20.030 --> 02:55:20.040 align:start position:0%
what you've done but I also think that
 
02:55:22.030 --> 02:55:22.040 align:start position:0%
there's a fails safe built in here if
 
02:55:25.030 --> 02:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
people are abusing this presumably they
 
02:55:26.030 --> 02:55:26.040 align:start position:0%
won't be
 
02:55:29.349 --> 02:55:29.359 align:start position:0%
reelected right and so we also have we
 
02:55:30.990 --> 02:55:31.000 align:start position:0%
have reasonableness that's going to be
 
02:55:33.750 --> 02:55:33.760 align:start position:0%
determined by initially by that person
 
02:55:36.389 --> 02:55:36.399 align:start position:0%
by that public official but then we also
 
02:55:38.550 --> 02:55:38.560 align:start position:0%
have the voters who are ultimately going
 
02:55:40.670 --> 02:55:40.680 align:start position:0%
to determine whether they think that
 
02:55:44.710 --> 02:55:44.720 align:start position:0%
person has been using reasonable in in a
 
02:55:44.720 --> 02:55:46.110 align:start position:0%
person has been using reasonable in in a
reasonable

02:55:46.110 --> 02:55:46.120 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
02:55:49.550 --> 02:55:49.560 align:start position:0%
way thank you any other
 
02:55:51.950 --> 02:55:51.960 align:start position:0%
questions see none thank you for coming
 
02:55:51.960 --> 02:55:53.030 align:start position:0%
questions see none thank you for coming
down

02:55:53.030 --> 02:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
down
 
02:55:57.550 --> 02:55:57.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:59.630 --> 02:55:59.640 align:start position:0%
kraan thank
 
02:56:06.190 --> 02:56:06.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:08.910 --> 02:56:08.920 align:start position:0%
Burns good morning everyone I'm Margaret
 
02:56:10.269 --> 02:56:10.279 align:start position:0%
Burns I'm the executive director of the
 
02:56:12.110 --> 02:56:12.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Municipal Association and
 
02:56:14.590 --> 02:56:14.600 align:start position:0%
we are here in support of Senate bill
 
02:56:17.590 --> 02:56:17.600 align:start position:0%
344 as you know and as has already been
 
02:56:19.510 --> 02:56:19.520 align:start position:0%
stated during the pandemic when the
 
02:56:21.469 --> 02:56:21.479 align:start position:0%
state of emergency was in effect
 
02:56:23.990 --> 02:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
emergency order number 12 gave public
 
02:56:25.950 --> 02:56:25.960 align:start position:0%
bodies significant flexibility with
 
02:56:28.630 --> 02:56:28.640 align:start position:0%
regard to holding public meetings via
 
02:56:30.990 --> 02:56:31.000 align:start position:0%
virtual means either entirely virtual or
 
02:56:33.269 --> 02:56:33.279 align:start position:0%
allowing more remote attendance than
 
02:56:35.269 --> 02:56:35.279 align:start position:0%
would normally be allowed under the
 
02:56:37.550 --> 02:56:37.560 align:start position:0%
current statute after that emergency
 
02:56:39.910 --> 02:56:39.920 align:start position:0%
order was lifted we continued to hear
 
02:56:42.630 --> 02:56:42.640 align:start position:0%
from members that they saw really great
 
02:56:44.590 --> 02:56:44.600 align:start position:0%
results from having that fle flexibility
 
02:56:46.910 --> 02:56:46.920 align:start position:0%
during the state of emergency not just
 
02:56:48.750 --> 02:56:48.760 align:start position:0%
the ability of elected officials to
 
02:56:51.070 --> 02:56:51.080 align:start position:0%
participate when there was a reason that
 
02:56:53.030 --> 02:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
kept them from being able to come out to
 
02:56:55.510 --> 02:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
the physical meeting space but also many
 
02:56:58.190 --> 02:56:58.200 align:start position:0%
communities saw this incredible influx
 
02:57:00.630 --> 02:57:00.640 align:start position:0%
of the public attending virtually
 
02:57:03.030 --> 02:57:03.040 align:start position:0%
because it was simply easier for them to
 
02:57:05.190 --> 02:57:05.200 align:start position:0%
fit it into their lives and to engage
 
02:57:06.469 --> 02:57:06.479 align:start position:0%
that way whether they were just
 
02:57:08.389 --> 02:57:08.399 align:start position:0%
listening to the meeting or whether they
 
02:57:10.469 --> 02:57:10.479 align:start position:0%
were also participating in public
 
02:57:12.790 --> 02:57:12.800 align:start position:0%
comment that way and so for that reasons
 
02:57:15.030 --> 02:57:15.040 align:start position:0%
our and for those reasons our members
 
02:57:17.269 --> 02:57:17.279 align:start position:0%
have asked us to support legislation
 
02:57:18.990 --> 02:57:19.000 align:start position:0%
that would give more flexibility for
 
02:57:22.710 --> 02:57:22.720 align:start position:0%
remote meetings Senate Bill 344 is an
 
02:57:26.870 --> 02:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
extremely narrow local option so it is
 
02:57:29.630 --> 02:57:29.640 align:start position:0%
much narrower than emergency order 12
 
02:57:31.830 --> 02:57:31.840 align:start position:0%
was and it is much narrower than Senate
 
02:57:34.630 --> 02:57:34.640 align:start position:0%
Bill 344 originally was when it was
 
02:57:37.229 --> 02:57:37.239 align:start position:0%
originally filed it is at its heart a
 
02:57:39.830 --> 02:57:39.840 align:start position:0%
local option it says right there in line
 
02:57:43.070 --> 02:57:43.080 align:start position:0%
three that a legislative body must adopt
 
02:57:45.349 --> 02:57:45.359 align:start position:0%
this provision for it to be effective so
 
02:57:48.670 --> 02:57:48.680 align:start position:0%
for the majority of our cities and towns
 
02:57:50.750 --> 02:57:50.760 align:start position:0%
or for the majority of our towns that is
 
02:57:52.990 --> 02:57:53.000 align:start position:0%
the voters at town meeting must adopt a
 
02:57:55.670 --> 02:57:55.680 align:start position:0%
warrant article that authorizes use of
 
02:57:58.150 --> 02:57:58.160 align:start position:0%
this local option um for the few Town
 
02:58:00.309 --> 02:58:00.319 align:start position:0%
Council towns and the cities that have
 
02:58:02.790 --> 02:58:02.800 align:start position:0%
the legislative body as their Council or
 
02:58:04.910 --> 02:58:04.920 align:start position:0%
as their Board of aldermen that would be
 
02:58:06.630 --> 02:58:06.640 align:start position:0%
the body that would have the authority
 
02:58:09.150 --> 02:58:09.160 align:start position:0%
to adopt this local option as would have
 
02:58:11.349 --> 02:58:11.359 align:start position:0%
the authority to adopt other local
 
02:58:14.030 --> 02:58:14.040 align:start position:0%
options the additional restrictions have
 
02:58:16.070 --> 02:58:16.080 align:start position:0%
already been mentioned you have to have
 
02:58:18.830 --> 02:58:18.840 align:start position:0%
a quart one quarter present uh the video
 
02:58:20.990 --> 02:58:21.000 align:start position:0%
must be on during the meeting you must
 
02:58:24.030 --> 02:58:24.040 align:start position:0%
recess and and adjourn if there's
 
02:58:26.309 --> 02:58:26.319 align:start position:0%
problems accessing the public meeting
 
02:58:28.550 --> 02:58:28.560 align:start position:0%
and really a variety of safeguards in
 
02:58:30.950 --> 02:58:30.960 align:start position:0%
place meant to ensure that public
 
02:58:33.190 --> 02:58:33.200 align:start position:0%
meetings through virtual means are not
 
02:58:35.630 --> 02:58:35.640 align:start position:0%
used to disenfranchise either elected
 
02:58:37.670 --> 02:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
officials or the public that they are
 
02:58:40.070 --> 02:58:40.080 align:start position:0%
actually used for the benefit of both
 
02:58:43.389 --> 02:58:43.399 align:start position:0%
the public and the public body and just
 
02:58:46.070 --> 02:58:46.080 align:start position:0%
as this local option can be adopted it
 
02:58:49.070 --> 02:58:49.080 align:start position:0%
can similar be similarly be rescinded in
 
02:58:51.150 --> 02:58:51.160 align:start position:0%
the same ma manner via a legislative
 
02:58:54.349 --> 02:58:54.359 align:start position:0%
body action it's very important too and
 
02:58:56.790 --> 02:58:56.800 align:start position:0%
this will be my last point that this
 
02:58:59.750 --> 02:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
bill does not affect any currently
 
02:59:02.269 --> 02:59:02.279 align:start position:0%
existing authority of public bodies
 
02:59:05.389 --> 02:59:05.399 align:start position:0%
under RSA 9182 so I think representative
 
02:59:08.469 --> 02:59:08.479 align:start position:0%
Horgan asked would this sort of undo the
 
02:59:11.309 --> 02:59:11.319 align:start position:0%
ability of public bodies to have the
 
02:59:13.030 --> 02:59:13.040 align:start position:0%
phone conference call remote
 
02:59:14.910 --> 02:59:14.920 align:start position:0%
participation that they've been using
 
02:59:17.110 --> 02:59:17.120 align:start position:0%
for a very long time that has been in
 
02:59:19.389 --> 02:59:19.399 align:start position:0%
statute long before the pandemic and
 
02:59:21.550 --> 02:59:21.560 align:start position:0%
long before the State of Emergency the
 
02:59:24.469 --> 02:59:24.479 align:start position:0%
answer is no this does not undo current
 
02:59:26.750 --> 02:59:26.760 align:start position:0%
authority to have a quorum of a public
 
02:59:29.389 --> 02:59:29.399 align:start position:0%
body present and allow a member or
 
02:59:31.670 --> 02:59:31.680 align:start position:0%
members to remotely participate and it
 
02:59:34.469 --> 02:59:34.479 align:start position:0%
importantly does not allow the authority
 
02:59:37.950 --> 02:59:37.960 align:start position:0%
of a board to have an emergency meeting
 
02:59:40.389 --> 02:59:40.399 align:start position:0%
defined as when immediate and necessary
 
02:59:42.990 --> 02:59:43.000 align:start position:0%
action is required it does not remove
 
02:59:45.150 --> 02:59:45.160 align:start position:0%
that Authority to have an emergency
 
02:59:46.990 --> 02:59:47.000 align:start position:0%
meeting with less than a quorum
 
02:59:49.229 --> 02:59:49.239 align:start position:0%
physically present in those very narrow
 
02:59:51.389 --> 02:59:51.399 align:start position:0%
circumstances so this is truly an
 
02:59:54.229 --> 02:59:54.239 align:start position:0%
additional Authority tacked on to the
 
02:59:58.269 --> 02:59:58.279 align:start position:0%
end of 91 A2 only to be exercised if the
 
03:00:01.429 --> 03:00:01.439 align:start position:0%
legislative body wishes to adopt it and
 
03:00:03.190 --> 03:00:03.200 align:start position:0%
so for those reasons we support Senate
 
03:00:05.309 --> 03:00:05.319 align:start position:0%
Bill 344 and I would be happy to take
 
03:00:07.790 --> 03:00:07.800 align:start position:0%
any questions there any questions from
 
03:00:10.469 --> 03:00:10.479 align:start position:0%
Miss Burns yes representative
 
03:00:12.750 --> 03:00:12.760 align:start position:0%
wer uh thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
03:00:16.550 --> 03:00:16.560 align:start position:0%
for taking my my question um legislative
 
03:00:19.469 --> 03:00:19.479 align:start position:0%
body must approve is that the council
 
03:00:21.870 --> 03:00:21.880 align:start position:0%
and the city council or is that the
 
03:00:24.469 --> 03:00:24.479 align:start position:0%
voters or the you know same thing in a
 
03:00:27.389 --> 03:00:27.399 align:start position:0%
town is it the Selectmen or the or the
 
03:00:29.750 --> 03:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh borders themselves in a town with a
 
03:00:32.150 --> 03:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
town meeting form of government it is
 
03:00:34.190 --> 03:00:34.200 align:start position:0%
the voters it is the people at town
 
03:00:35.590 --> 03:00:35.600 align:start position:0%
meeting who would have to vote on a
 
03:00:38.910 --> 03:00:38.920 align:start position:0%
warrant article in our 13 cities the
 
03:00:41.309 --> 03:00:41.319 align:start position:0%
legislative body is the board of
 
03:00:43.389 --> 03:00:43.399 align:start position:0%
aldermen and the city council so that
 
03:00:45.229 --> 03:00:45.239 align:start position:0%
would be be the legislative body in
 
03:00:47.190 --> 03:00:47.200 align:start position:0%
those communities that would have the
 
03:00:49.590 --> 03:00:49.600 align:start position:0%
power to adopt this local
 
03:00:55.469 --> 03:00:55.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:57.469 --> 03:00:57.479 align:start position:0%
Sylvia thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
03:00:59.389 --> 03:00:59.399 align:start position:0%
for taking my question getting back to
 
03:01:03.150 --> 03:01:03.160 align:start position:0%
the previous discussion of uh reasonably
 
03:01:07.030 --> 03:01:07.040 align:start position:0%
practical and the requirement that uh
 
03:01:09.710 --> 03:01:09.720 align:start position:0%
only a quarter of the public body needs
 
03:01:13.070 --> 03:01:13.080 align:start position:0%
to be there for a quorum that means 3/4
 
03:01:14.429 --> 03:01:14.439 align:start position:0%
of the body
 
03:01:17.550 --> 03:01:17.560 align:start position:0%
is reasonably practically unable to
 
03:01:17.560 --> 03:01:19.349 align:start position:0%
is reasonably practically unable to
attend

03:01:19.349 --> 03:01:19.359 align:start position:0%
attend
 
03:01:23.750 --> 03:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
um I have a hard time understanding what
 
03:01:26.510 --> 03:01:26.520 align:start position:0%
kind of reasonable and practical has
 
03:01:28.910 --> 03:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
three4 of the body
 
03:01:32.309 --> 03:01:32.319 align:start position:0%
missing this one of the scenarios where
 
03:01:34.950 --> 03:01:34.960 align:start position:0%
it would apply is when you have a thre
 
03:01:37.469 --> 03:01:37.479 align:start position:0%
member select board occasionally you
 
03:01:41.309 --> 03:01:41.319 align:start position:0%
have two members who are sick or one who
 
03:01:44.389 --> 03:01:44.399 align:start position:0%
has just had surgery or one one who has
 
03:01:47.269 --> 03:01:47.279 align:start position:0%
child care and must stay home with that
 
03:01:51.150 --> 03:01:51.160 align:start position:0%
child and one who has covid and in those
 
03:01:53.510 --> 03:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
circumstances the board wishes to
 
03:01:55.950 --> 03:01:55.960 align:start position:0%
continue to have its regularly scheduled
 
03:01:58.229 --> 03:01:58.239 align:start position:0%
meeting and conduct its business but
 
03:02:00.710 --> 03:02:00.720 align:start position:0%
current law would not allow them to do
 
03:02:03.389 --> 03:02:03.399 align:start position:0%
that because they would need a quorum of
 
03:02:06.190 --> 03:02:06.200 align:start position:0%
two in order to be able to hold that
 
03:02:09.110 --> 03:02:09.120 align:start position:0%
public meeting and so this really gives
 
03:02:11.469 --> 03:02:11.479 align:start position:0%
flexibility in those types of
 
03:02:14.070 --> 03:02:14.080 align:start position:0%
circumstances and to the conver ation
 
03:02:15.990 --> 03:02:16.000 align:start position:0%
about the terminology reasonably
 
03:02:19.710 --> 03:02:19.720 align:start position:0%
practical I can tell you that at nhma we
 
03:02:21.830 --> 03:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
recommend that members that
 
03:02:24.150 --> 03:02:24.160 align:start position:0%
municipalities construe reasonably
 
03:02:27.510 --> 03:02:27.520 align:start position:0%
practical narrowly right so cannot get
 
03:02:29.990 --> 03:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
out of something that prohibits them
 
03:02:31.429 --> 03:02:31.439 align:start position:0%
from physically being at the meeting
 
03:02:34.590 --> 03:02:34.600 align:start position:0%
space surgery illness um they're a
 
03:02:36.590 --> 03:02:36.600 align:start position:0%
primary caregiver for a child or an
 
03:02:39.190 --> 03:02:39.200 align:start position:0%
adult and they're unable to leave their
 
03:02:40.670 --> 03:02:40.680 align:start position:0%
physical location and come to the
 
03:02:42.389 --> 03:02:42.399 align:start position:0%
meeting space and that is how we
 
03:02:44.830 --> 03:02:44.840 align:start position:0%
encourage public public bodies to treat
 
03:02:49.110 --> 03:02:49.120 align:start position:0%
reasonably practical thank you represent
 
03:02:51.630 --> 03:02:51.640 align:start position:0%
weather representative
 
03:02:53.870 --> 03:02:53.880 align:start position:0%
mlan thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
03:02:57.269 --> 03:02:57.279 align:start position:0%
taking my question my district um has
 
03:03:00.389 --> 03:03:00.399 align:start position:0%
Lichfield and Manchester in it so the
 
03:03:03.469 --> 03:03:03.479 align:start position:0%
way that this law is written my
 
03:03:05.670 --> 03:03:05.680 align:start position:0%
constituents in lynfield I'm assuming it
 
03:03:08.469 --> 03:03:08.479 align:start position:0%
would be a ballot question uh that would
 
03:03:10.990 --> 03:03:11.000 align:start position:0%
come about and so if the legislative
 
03:03:13.830 --> 03:03:13.840 align:start position:0%
body the people of litfield wanted to do
 
03:03:15.990 --> 03:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
it they they would have the voice to say
 
03:03:20.229 --> 03:03:20.239 align:start position:0%
yes or no um however in Manchester um
 
03:03:21.910 --> 03:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
the citizens of Manchester those
 
03:03:24.150 --> 03:03:24.160 align:start position:0%
constituents really wouldn't have that
 
03:03:26.030 --> 03:03:26.040 align:start position:0%
choice it would be left to the board
 
03:03:28.750 --> 03:03:28.760 align:start position:0%
itself to decide and and if the citizens
 
03:03:31.150 --> 03:03:31.160 align:start position:0%
of Manchester said that we really don't
 
03:03:33.790 --> 03:03:33.800 align:start position:0%
want that we we really this doesn't work
 
03:03:37.269 --> 03:03:37.279 align:start position:0%
for us that voice is kind of denied to
 
03:03:39.630 --> 03:03:39.640 align:start position:0%
them under this bill what would be your
 
03:03:42.790 --> 03:03:42.800 align:start position:0%
thoughts you know about amending this to
 
03:03:45.030 --> 03:03:45.040 align:start position:0%
maybe say if has to be on a ballot
 
03:03:47.110 --> 03:03:47.120 align:start position:0%
question or something like that you know
 
03:03:48.790 --> 03:03:48.800 align:start position:0%
for the cities and towns because I just
 
03:03:50.870 --> 03:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
see a difference with respect to
 
03:03:53.830 --> 03:03:53.840 align:start position:0%
fairness between the cities and towns
 
03:03:56.590 --> 03:03:56.600 align:start position:0%
and and how it's implemented I guess my
 
03:03:58.630 --> 03:03:58.640 align:start position:0%
response to that would be that the
 
03:04:02.190 --> 03:04:02.200 align:start position:0%
voters are getting the voice in both
 
03:04:04.389 --> 03:04:04.399 align:start position:0%
circumstances but they're just different
 
03:04:06.710 --> 03:04:06.720 align:start position:0%
types of government in those two
 
03:04:08.070 --> 03:04:08.080 align:start position:0%
different communities that you've
 
03:04:10.550 --> 03:04:10.560 align:start position:0%
referenced so in Lichfield yes
 
03:04:12.670 --> 03:04:12.680 align:start position:0%
everything essentially goes to the
 
03:04:14.389 --> 03:04:14.399 align:start position:0%
voters at Town meeting because that's
 
03:04:16.190 --> 03:04:16.200 align:start position:0%
the structure of government that that
 
03:04:19.309 --> 03:04:19.319 align:start position:0%
has been adopted in that community in
 
03:04:21.429 --> 03:04:21.439 align:start position:0%
the city of Manchester they have a
 
03:04:23.030 --> 03:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
representative form of government
 
03:04:25.150 --> 03:04:25.160 align:start position:0%
essentially where that is the structure
 
03:04:27.309 --> 03:04:27.319 align:start position:0%
of the Manchester City government and
 
03:04:30.229 --> 03:04:30.239 align:start position:0%
the voice of Voters is going through
 
03:04:33.190 --> 03:04:33.200 align:start position:0%
their elected council members who act as
 
03:04:35.469 --> 03:04:35.479 align:start position:0%
the legislative body in that
 
03:04:39.110 --> 03:04:39.120 align:start position:0%
municipality so it's consistent in both
 
03:04:41.150 --> 03:04:41.160 align:start position:0%
communities because that's the form of
 
03:04:43.750 --> 03:04:43.760 align:start position:0%
government and that's the way that local
 
03:04:46.389 --> 03:04:46.399 align:start position:0%
options and ordinances are adopted in
 
03:04:50.830 --> 03:04:50.840 align:start position:0%
both of those two different types of
 
03:04:56.630 --> 03:04:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:59.150 --> 03:04:59.160 align:start position:0%
questions I guess one question do you
 
03:05:01.389 --> 03:05:01.399 align:start position:0%
think it would be practical at all if
 
03:05:04.269 --> 03:05:04.279 align:start position:0%
you made it a requirement that the
 
03:05:07.510 --> 03:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
approve legislative approval be done on
 
03:05:12.269 --> 03:05:12.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:12.279 --> 03:05:14.750 align:start position:0%
 
basis

03:05:14.750 --> 03:05:14.760 align:start position:0%
basis
 
03:05:17.670 --> 03:05:17.680 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I would object to that um
 
03:05:20.510 --> 03:05:20.520 align:start position:0%
you know because of course voters can of
 
03:05:21.590 --> 03:05:21.600 align:start position:0%
course we're talking about a town
 
03:05:23.790 --> 03:05:23.800 align:start position:0%
meeting form of government voters could
 
03:05:25.990 --> 03:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
petition at any annual meeting to resend
 
03:05:27.870 --> 03:05:27.880 align:start position:0%
it right so if it was adopted last year
 
03:05:29.510 --> 03:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
and they don't feel it's working well or
 
03:05:31.429 --> 03:05:31.439 align:start position:0%
they don't want it anymore a group of
 
03:05:33.710 --> 03:05:33.720 align:start position:0%
Voters could put it on the warrant and
 
03:05:36.070 --> 03:05:36.080 align:start position:0%
and get it uh rescinded but the idea of
 
03:05:40.349 --> 03:05:40.359 align:start position:0%
having it being a standing renewal
 
03:05:43.950 --> 03:05:43.960 align:start position:0%
question I don't see any immediate
 
03:05:49.630 --> 03:05:49.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:07.630 --> 03:06:07.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:10.030 --> 03:06:10.040 align:start position:0%
Horan thank you Mr chair and members of
 
03:06:11.670 --> 03:06:11.680 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Kate Horan I
 
03:06:13.590 --> 03:06:13.600 align:start position:0%
serve as the executive director for the
 
03:06:16.150 --> 03:06:16.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Association of counties
 
03:06:18.070 --> 03:06:18.080 align:start position:0%
which is all your elected and appointed
 
03:06:20.349 --> 03:06:20.359 align:start position:0%
officials at the County government level
 
03:06:22.790 --> 03:06:22.800 align:start position:0%
uh we are in support of this bill
 
03:06:25.830 --> 03:06:25.840 align:start position:0%
primarily for our association we have a
 
03:06:29.590 --> 03:06:29.600 align:start position:0%
50 member Statewide board that has
 
03:06:31.870 --> 03:06:31.880 align:start position:0%
difficulties meeting their quum
 
03:06:34.429 --> 03:06:34.439 align:start position:0%
requirements we've already made changes
 
03:06:36.750 --> 03:06:36.760 align:start position:0%
in our bylaws that are allowable under
 
03:06:40.830 --> 03:06:40.840 align:start position:0%
law to make me meeting our Quorum easier
 
03:06:42.670 --> 03:06:42.680 align:start position:0%
however we still have problems for
 
03:06:45.469 --> 03:06:45.479 align:start position:0%
example on Friday I may have to cancel
 
03:06:47.349 --> 03:06:47.359 align:start position:0%
my meeting because everyone's going to
 
03:06:50.469 --> 03:06:50.479 align:start position:0%
be away for Easter break this would
 
03:06:53.190 --> 03:06:53.200 align:start position:0%
allow us to have our meetings and make
 
03:06:55.550 --> 03:06:55.560 align:start position:0%
sure that our business is conducted
 
03:06:57.910 --> 03:06:57.920 align:start position:0%
efficiently and effectively so that we
 
03:07:00.309 --> 03:07:00.319 align:start position:0%
can come here and tell you how
 
03:07:03.389 --> 03:07:03.399 align:start position:0%
legislation will impact governments we
 
03:07:06.269 --> 03:07:06.279 align:start position:0%
also have over 15 subcommittees and
 
03:07:09.229 --> 03:07:09.239 align:start position:0%
Affiliates that are all Statewide Susan
 
03:07:11.590 --> 03:07:11.600 align:start position:0%
craigan who is here she works with the
 
03:07:14.229 --> 03:07:14.239 align:start position:0%
register she's the register of from arac
 
03:07:17.429 --> 03:07:17.439 align:start position:0%
trying to allow our 10 registers of
 
03:07:19.070 --> 03:07:19.080 align:start position:0%
Deeds to get together to have an
 
03:07:21.550 --> 03:07:21.560 align:start position:0%
affiliate meeting when the Register of
 
03:07:24.830 --> 03:07:24.840 align:start position:0%
Deeds office is extremely overwhelmed
 
03:07:27.389 --> 03:07:27.399 align:start position:0%
with uh requests and information and
 
03:07:30.790 --> 03:07:30.800 align:start position:0%
deeds with all of the uh real estate
 
03:07:32.990 --> 03:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
exchanges that are going on now would be
 
03:07:35.469 --> 03:07:35.479 align:start position:0%
great right now they call an emergency
 
03:07:37.429 --> 03:07:37.439 align:start position:0%
meeting every couple months because they
 
03:07:39.630 --> 03:07:39.640 align:start position:0%
have to get together and they have to
 
03:07:41.870 --> 03:07:41.880 align:start position:0%
meet to make decisions but that's the
 
03:07:43.670 --> 03:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
only way that they can meet they can't
 
03:07:45.550 --> 03:07:45.560 align:start position:0%
take time away from their offices
 
03:07:49.030 --> 03:07:49.040 align:start position:0%
because they are so under staffed um it
 
03:07:52.150 --> 03:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
would also help out your uh local County
 
03:07:54.389 --> 03:07:54.399 align:start position:0%
governments uh for those of you who are
 
03:07:56.510 --> 03:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
in the Western and Northern portions of
 
03:07:59.070 --> 03:07:59.080 align:start position:0%
the state sometimes it can be snowing in
 
03:08:00.590 --> 03:08:00.600 align:start position:0%
one portion of the county and not
 
03:08:02.790 --> 03:08:02.800 align:start position:0%
snowing in another portion of the county
 
03:08:04.429 --> 03:08:04.439 align:start position:0%
but we would still like to have our
 
03:08:06.030 --> 03:08:06.040 align:start position:0%
meeting and allowing people to
 
03:08:08.269 --> 03:08:08.279 align:start position:0%
participate remotely would be very
 
03:08:10.630 --> 03:08:10.640 align:start position:0%
effective uh I did participate with
 
03:08:12.269 --> 03:08:12.279 align:start position:0%
representative welper in the study
 
03:08:14.910 --> 03:08:14.920 align:start position:0%
committee on House Bill 108 and this
 
03:08:17.190 --> 03:08:17.200 align:start position:0%
bill does include many of the
 
03:08:19.110 --> 03:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
recommendations that came out of that
 
03:08:21.750 --> 03:08:21.760 align:start position:0%
study committee this is a very narrowly
 
03:08:23.870 --> 03:08:23.880 align:start position:0%
targeted bill that will help us
 
03:08:25.750 --> 03:08:25.760 align:start position:0%
accomplish our work thank you Mr
 
03:08:27.870 --> 03:08:27.880 align:start position:0%
chairman I'm happy to take any questions
 
03:08:29.870 --> 03:08:29.880 align:start position:0%
that the committee has questions from
 
03:08:29.880 --> 03:08:30.630 align:start position:0%
that the committee has questions from

Horgan
representative

03:08:37.389 --> 03:08:37.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:40.870 --> 03:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
Horgan um yes um with regards with
 
03:08:42.790 --> 03:08:42.800 align:start position:0%
regards to the county um it's a little
 
03:08:45.550 --> 03:08:45.560 align:start position:0%
bit ambiguous who the legislative body
 
03:08:48.349 --> 03:08:48.359 align:start position:0%
for the county is is it the county
 
03:08:51.389 --> 03:08:51.399 align:start position:0%
delegation or is it but we have very
 
03:08:53.429 --> 03:08:53.439 align:start position:0%
limited powers though so like so would
 
03:08:55.070 --> 03:08:55.080 align:start position:0%
it be the county delegation or would it
 
03:08:56.870 --> 03:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
have to be the entire uh entire
 
03:08:59.870 --> 03:08:59.880 align:start position:0%
legislature who sets the uh who would
 
03:09:02.110 --> 03:09:02.120 align:start position:0%
who would have to pass a uh who' have to
 
03:09:03.910 --> 03:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
decide whether or not they want to use
 
03:09:05.990 --> 03:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
this procedure in their County for at
 
03:09:07.550 --> 03:09:07.560 align:start position:0%
the county level it is the county
 
03:09:09.349 --> 03:09:09.359 align:start position:0%
delegation and representative mlan to
 
03:09:10.790 --> 03:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
answer your question because Margaret
 
03:09:13.150 --> 03:09:13.160 align:start position:0%
and I literally just did this exercise
 
03:09:16.150 --> 03:09:16.160 align:start position:0%
for another committee there is no
 
03:09:19.790 --> 03:09:19.800 align:start position:0%
practical way to put a warrant article
 
03:09:23.389 --> 03:09:23.399 align:start position:0%
and a in front of every single Community
 
03:09:25.790 --> 03:09:25.800 align:start position:0%
every single year take Hillsboro for
 
03:09:28.870 --> 03:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
example the towns vote in March some of
 
03:09:30.830 --> 03:09:30.840 align:start position:0%
them vote in May on the alternate town
 
03:09:33.790 --> 03:09:33.800 align:start position:0%
meeting day Manchester meets every other
 
03:09:36.830 --> 03:09:36.840 align:start position:0%
year in October there's no way to do
 
03:09:39.790 --> 03:09:39.800 align:start position:0%
that and is that really the right place
 
03:09:42.950 --> 03:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
for uh questions to be decided by the
 
03:09:45.190 --> 03:09:45.200 align:start position:0%
the County government at the Town level
 
03:09:47.070 --> 03:09:47.080 align:start position:0%
we would argue no that that should be
 
03:09:50.630 --> 03:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
handled by the county delegation so if
 
03:09:53.150 --> 03:09:53.160 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro's County delegation decides no
 
03:09:54.950 --> 03:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
we don't want to have this remote
 
03:09:57.349 --> 03:09:57.359 align:start position:0%
meeting option you don't have to do it
 
03:09:59.030 --> 03:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
and I think that's the great thing about
 
03:09:59.040 --> 03:10:00.309 align:start position:0%
and I think that's the great thing about
this

03:10:00.309 --> 03:10:00.319 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:10:03.309 --> 03:10:03.319 align:start position:0%
bill other
 
03:10:05.429 --> 03:10:05.439 align:start position:0%
questions see none thank you for your
 
03:10:07.550 --> 03:10:07.560 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you is there anyone else
 
03:10:11.830 --> 03:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
who wishes to testify on Senate Bill
 
03:10:11.840 --> 03:10:13.670 align:start position:0%
who wishes to testify on Senate Bill
344

03:10:13.670 --> 03:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
344
 
03:10:17.349 --> 03:10:17.359 align:start position:0%
seeing no one we'll declare the hearing
 
03:10:21.830 --> 03:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
closed and I think that concludes our
 
03:10:25.229 --> 03:10:25.239 align:start position:0%
business this morning I'll just remind
 
03:10:27.349 --> 03:10:27.359 align:start position:0%

03:10:34.790 --> 03:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
208 is there anything else that we need
 
03:10:37.830 --> 03:10:37.840 align:start position:0%
to address and of course for everybody
 
03:10:40.389 --> 03:10:40.399 align:start position:0%
