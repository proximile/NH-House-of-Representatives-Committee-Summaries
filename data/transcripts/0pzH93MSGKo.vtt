00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 align:start position:0%
good morning everyone uh welcome to the
 
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 align:start position:0%
uh special committee on covid uh
 
00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:24.879 align:start position:0%
response efficacy um I'd like to open
 
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 align:start position:0%
the meeting with a pledge uh and if
 
00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 align:start position:0%
representative warry could lead us that
 
00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 align:start position:0%
to the flag of the United States of
 
00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 align:start position:0%
America and to the Republic for which it
 
00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 align:start position:0%
stands one nation under God indivisible
 
00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 align:start position:0%
all I would just like to remind everyone
 
00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 align:start position:0%
that this is a bipartisan committee that
 
00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 align:start position:0%
is tasked with investigating and
 
00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 align:start position:0%
evaluating the state's response to the
 
00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
covid-19 pandemic the committee will
 
00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 align:start position:0%
function in a science-based fact finding
 
00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 align:start position:0%
review specifically acquiring
 
00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 align:start position:0%
comprehensive accurate data and all
 
00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
related information pertaining ther
 
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 align:start position:0%
to areas of particular Focus will
 
00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
include the administration of federal
 
00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 align:start position:0%
guidance acceptance of federal funds and
 
00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
implementation of emergency use
 
00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 align:start position:0%
authorization vaccination efforts a
 
00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:19.879 align:start position:0%
report will be issued outlining the
 
00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 align:start position:0%
committee's findings and the impact on
 
00:03:24.149 --> 00:03:24.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and this morning we have
 
00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:27.799 align:start position:0%
the pleasure of welcoming Dr Chan uh and
 
00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 align:start position:0%
Dr Chan if you'd introduce yourself and
 
00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 align:start position:0%
started testing oh there we go okay uh
 
00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is uh Benjamin Shan
 
00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
I am uh the state epidemiologist at the
 
00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of Health and
 
00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:47.799 align:start position:0%
Human Services uh also an infectious
 
00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319 align:start position:0%
disease physician and I've been working
 
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 align:start position:0%
at the state for about 10 years now
 
00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 align:start position:0%
groda thank you good morning Dr Chan
 
00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.640 align:start position:0%
good morning so in light of the
 
00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 align:start position:0%
commission the committee's um
 
00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 align:start position:0%
goals I'd like to know if there are
 
00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:15.079 align:start position:0%
things that now looking back on the on
 
00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 align:start position:0%
what we've done as as as a whole for the
 
00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 align:start position:0%
state um because I really I think the
 
00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:24.639 align:start position:0%
communication that one on with the
 
00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 align:start position:0%
public was very
 
00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:29.919 align:start position:0%
good and um what other types of the
 
00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 align:start position:0%
things do you think were both positive
 
00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:35.919 align:start position:0%
or areas where we could use
 
00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 align:start position:0%
Improvement yeah uh thank you for that
 
00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 align:start position:0%
question um
 
00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 align:start position:0%
so it might be um helpful if I frame my
 
00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:49.759 align:start position:0%
comments with a few sort of general or
 
00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 align:start position:0%
more broad comments um about the co9
 
00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 align:start position:0%
response maybe I can first start by
 
00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 align:start position:0%
saying that um you know the pandemic
 
00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 align:start position:0%
was a long time you know over the course
 
00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 align:start position:0%
of two or three years um and during that
 
00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:10.479 align:start position:0%
time the goals and the the objectives of
 
00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:13.880 align:start position:0%
what we did as a state changed right so
 
00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:16.720 align:start position:0%
what we were trying to do when co9 first
 
00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 align:start position:0%
emerged back in the beginning of 2020
 
00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 align:start position:0%
was very different from what we were
 
00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:24.479 align:start position:0%
doing even six 10 months later the goals
 
00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:28.479 align:start position:0%
of our work changed over time um and
 
00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:30.560 align:start position:0%
partly that was because of just the
 
00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:32.759 align:start position:0%
evolving nature of a pandemic and
 
00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:35.720 align:start position:0%
responding to a new emerging threat or
 
00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
pathogen um and partly that's because
 
00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.080 align:start position:0%
the um understanding or our scientific
 
00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
knowledge of a new pathogen changed over
 
00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
time um but I think there are some sort
 
00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:53.720 align:start position:0%
of common themes throughout that long um
 
00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:00.479 align:start position:0%
response and um anytime there is a new
 
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
emerging infectious disease
 
00:06:07.309 --> 00:06:07.319 align:start position:0%
threat uh we oftentimes start from a
 
00:06:07.319 --> 00:06:09.350 align:start position:0%
threat uh we oftentimes start from a
standpoint

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:09.360 align:start position:0%
standpoint
 
00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:11.720 align:start position:0%
of I think what you saw happen in the
 
00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:14.759 align:start position:0%
covid-19 pandemic which is more of a
 
00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:17.080 align:start position:0%
goal of containment right a containment
 
00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:21.080 align:start position:0%
strategy trying to prevent an infection
 
00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:23.919 align:start position:0%
a pathogen from from spreading further
 
00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:25.720 align:start position:0%
as opposed to what we saw later in the
 
00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:28.360 align:start position:0%
pandemic which was mitigation slowing
 
00:06:31.309 --> 00:06:31.319 align:start position:0%
the spread you know lessening the impact
 
00:06:34.189 --> 00:06:34.199 align:start position:0%
when a new infectious pathogen emerge
 
00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
emerges often times the goal is
 
00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:38.960 align:start position:0%
containment and so the question is how
 
00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:43.240 align:start position:0%
do we how do we do that um and a lot of
 
00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:45.960 align:start position:0%
it is by identifying people that are
 
00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:48.639 align:start position:0%
infected which requires testing that's
 
00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:50.960 align:start position:0%
why there's so much Focus upfront during
 
00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
the pandemic on testing and getting out
 
00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:55.280 align:start position:0%
more tests and if we can only test more
 
00:06:57.749 --> 00:06:57.759 align:start position:0%
people we could maybe contain the virus
 
00:06:59.270 --> 00:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
now that ultimately proved not to be
 
00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
true but we didn't know that at the time
 
00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:04.120 align:start position:0%
but there's a lot of focus upfront on
 
00:07:06.469 --> 00:07:06.479 align:start position:0%
testing um but then the question is well
 
00:07:08.589 --> 00:07:08.599 align:start position:0%
what do we do with the test results when
 
00:07:12.029 --> 00:07:12.039 align:start position:0%
somebody's positive for example um and
 
00:07:14.189 --> 00:07:14.199 align:start position:0%
that gets to you know trying to make
 
00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:16.840 align:start position:0%
sure people that are infected stay home
 
00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:18.280 align:start position:0%
meaning they isolate that's the
 
00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
technical term and people that may have
 
00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:23.680 align:start position:0%
been exposed and are at risk for coming
 
00:07:26.629 --> 00:07:26.639 align:start position:0%
down with an infection quarantine or you
 
00:07:28.189 --> 00:07:28.199 align:start position:0%
know remove themselves from public
 
00:07:29.629 --> 00:07:29.639 align:start position:0%
settings right so those are are
 
00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
technical terms and actually legal terms
 
00:07:34.029 --> 00:07:34.039 align:start position:0%
isolation is for people that are
 
00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:36.440 align:start position:0%
infected quarantine is for people that
 
00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:38.720 align:start position:0%
were exposed and might at some point
 
00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:41.720 align:start position:0%
come down with infection and so that
 
00:07:45.189 --> 00:07:45.199 align:start position:0%
work that we did up front um was very
 
00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:48.840 align:start position:0%
very time and labor intensive trying to
 
00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
test people trying to take those people
 
00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
that tested positive and make sure that
 
00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:55.560 align:start position:0%
they were staying home staying out of
 
00:07:58.350 --> 00:07:58.360 align:start position:0%
public places isolating um trying to do
 
00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:00.120 align:start position:0%
contact tracing
 
00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:01.960 align:start position:0%
uh to identify people that may have been
 
00:08:04.869 --> 00:08:04.879 align:start position:0%
exposed so that they could
 
00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:08.120 align:start position:0%
quarantine um that
 
00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
is fairly typical with any new emerging
 
00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
infectious pathogen I mean empx
 
00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:19.800 align:start position:0%
outbreaks for example or marberg you
 
00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:22.960 align:start position:0%
know these are just more recent examples
 
00:08:25.909 --> 00:08:25.919 align:start position:0%
um people with uh highly pathogenic Aven
 
00:08:29.309 --> 00:08:29.319 align:start position:0%
influenza infection right any any type
 
00:08:31.469 --> 00:08:31.479 align:start position:0%
of emerging infectious disease that
 
00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:33.240 align:start position:0%
typically is The Upfront work that
 
00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:35.880 align:start position:0%
public health in in particular does
 
00:08:37.389 --> 00:08:37.399 align:start position:0%
testing to identify people that are
 
00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:40.800 align:start position:0%
infected isolation quarantine that's
 
00:08:42.829 --> 00:08:42.839 align:start position:0%
part of a larger containment
 
00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:44.680 align:start position:0%
strategy and I'm sorry that's a long
 
00:08:47.389 --> 00:08:47.399 align:start position:0%
lead in to answer your question um which
 
00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:50.200 align:start position:0%
is what what can be done or what is
 
00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:53.640 align:start position:0%
needed to do a lot of that upfront work
 
00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:56.920 align:start position:0%
um a lot of it is uh I think comes down
 
00:08:59.590 --> 00:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
to Workforce issues Workforce Capac
 
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
capacity um this is an issue both with
 
00:09:04.949 --> 00:09:04.959 align:start position:0%
Healthcare Workforce so who does the
 
00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:07.160 align:start position:0%
testing for example you know we don't
 
00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:10.160 align:start position:0%
have public health clinics that are
 
00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:12.320 align:start position:0%
established that are that routinely
 
00:09:15.829 --> 00:09:15.839 align:start position:0%
operate to try and get people tested or
 
00:09:17.269 --> 00:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
vaccinated or treated right we have to
 
00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:19.000 align:start position:0%
rely on the existing Health Care
 
00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
infrastructure to do a lot of that work
 
00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
um and that proved to and continues to
 
00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:30.160 align:start position:0%
prove to be a challenge um with any new
 
00:09:32.269 --> 00:09:32.279 align:start position:0%
infectious disease outbreak there's
 
00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:35.240 align:start position:0%
always this push to try and set up
 
00:09:37.269 --> 00:09:37.279 align:start position:0%
testing centers you know if there's a
 
00:09:39.509 --> 00:09:39.519 align:start position:0%
vaccine available vaccination centers
 
00:09:40.829 --> 00:09:40.839 align:start position:0%
and so it comes down to a Workforce
 
00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:42.760 align:start position:0%
issue to do that upfront testing
 
00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:45.680 align:start position:0%
vaccination treatment but also takes a
 
00:09:48.269 --> 00:09:48.279 align:start position:0%
lot of personnel to do the contact
 
00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:52.040 align:start position:0%
tracing um and the data systems involved
 
00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:54.160 align:start position:0%
don't talk well to one another right so
 
00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
when a provider tests somebody in in
 
00:09:59.710 --> 00:09:59.720 align:start position:0%
their Health Care System had that
 
00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:01.600 align:start position:0%
positive test get transmitted to Public
 
00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
Health so that we can act on it you know
 
00:10:06.389 --> 00:10:06.399 align:start position:0%
these two you know informatic systems
 
00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
don't talk to one another um and so
 
00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:11.200 align:start position:0%
there's always a natural delay in that
 
00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
process and so you know I think from a
 
00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:17.560 align:start position:0%
broad lens a lot of the things that are
 
00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:21.000 align:start position:0%
needed come down to people Workforce
 
00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:22.440 align:start position:0%
both in the healthcare sector and in the
 
00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
public health sector and then um modern
 
00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:29.320 align:start position:0%
informatic systems that are able to be
 
00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
interconnected now some of that is
 
00:10:33.509 --> 00:10:33.519 align:start position:0%
National level issues and funding that's
 
00:10:36.069 --> 00:10:36.079 align:start position:0%
being worked on to have interconnected
 
00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:38.600 align:start position:0%
Data Systems so that Health Care Systems
 
00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:40.160 align:start position:0%
can talk with Public Health Systems can
 
00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:42.120 align:start position:0%
talk with Federal systems so that there
 
00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:43.800 align:start position:0%
can be a more seamless timely exchange
 
00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:46.040 align:start position:0%
of information um but but those were
 
00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:47.680 align:start position:0%
those were issues that came up over and
 
00:10:49.269 --> 00:10:49.279 align:start position:0%
over again throughout the pandemic do we
 
00:10:52.389 --> 00:10:52.399 align:start position:0%
have the people um do we have uh the
 
00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
data systems um you know whether it was
 
00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
you know doing contact tracing and
 
00:10:58.590 --> 00:10:58.600 align:start position:0%
investigating people that were infected
 
00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
that were was early in the pandemic or
 
00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:02.720 align:start position:0%
needing to vaccinate people later in the
 
00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:04.720 align:start position:0%
pandemic you know uh having an
 
00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
information an immunization information
 
00:11:10.389 --> 00:11:10.399 align:start position:0%
system that worked for example um was
 
00:11:12.629 --> 00:11:12.639 align:start position:0%
was a major challenge so that that was a
 
00:11:14.269 --> 00:11:14.279 align:start position:0%
long-winded answer and I apologize to
 
00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
your question but I think a lot of this
 
00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
comes down to people and systems Data
 
00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:22.160 align:start position:0%
Systems in particular that that work um
 
00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
this was also highlighted I think in the
 
00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:27.560 align:start position:0%
after action report that was put out a
 
00:11:31.829 --> 00:11:31.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:33.680 align:start position:0%
are you referring to the report that was
 
00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
put out by the homeland security yes
 
00:11:39.829 --> 00:11:39.839 align:start position:0%
okay good follow up thank you so on the
 
00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:42.720 align:start position:0%
um issue of People MH I think that's
 
00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:45.200 align:start position:0%
more challenging than Data
 
00:11:48.829 --> 00:11:48.839 align:start position:0%
Systems especially in our state although
 
00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:50.720 align:start position:0%
you know it seems to be everywhere in
 
00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
this and when you're talking about
 
00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
people are you talking about Medical
 
00:11:58.829 --> 00:11:58.839 align:start position:0%
healthc Care people or just all sorts of
 
00:11:58.839 --> 00:12:00.030 align:start position:0%
healthc Care people or just all sorts of
levels

00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:00.040 align:start position:0%
levels
 
00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:02.760 align:start position:0%
um well I think it depends on what the
 
00:12:05.069 --> 00:12:05.079 align:start position:0%
response requires I I know that the
 
00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:08.120 align:start position:0%
Health Care System um right now even
 
00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:10.120 align:start position:0%
coming out of the pandemic years later
 
00:12:12.629 --> 00:12:12.639 align:start position:0%
is is struggling I I mean even finding
 
00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:15.240 align:start position:0%
you know Personnel to you know support
 
00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:17.000 align:start position:0%
Personnel administrative Personnel not
 
00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:19.160 align:start position:0%
just the healthcare providers um but
 
00:12:22.269 --> 00:12:22.279 align:start position:0%
just to to give you an example of um
 
00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
coming out of the covid-19 pandemic uh
 
00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:28.880 align:start position:0%
there happened to be an empo outbreak um
 
00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:30.800 align:start position:0%
and and I don't want to go too far you
 
00:12:34.069 --> 00:12:34.079 align:start position:0%
know into the weeds but we actually had
 
00:12:34.079 --> 00:12:35.629 align:start position:0%
know into the weeds but we actually had
a

00:12:35.629 --> 00:12:35.639 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:38.360 align:start position:0%
vaccine uh that can prevent empx
 
00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:40.720 align:start position:0%
infection but we struggled to roll it
 
00:12:42.629 --> 00:12:42.639 align:start position:0%
out because we couldn't find the Health
 
00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:46.040 align:start position:0%
Care Partners that were that had the
 
00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
staff and the capacity um to be able to
 
00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:51.680 align:start position:0%
work with us in standing up vaccine
 
00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
clinics to prevent you know to vaccinate
 
00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
against empo that's the Jos vaccine um
 
00:12:59.829 --> 00:12:59.839 align:start position:0%
and it was and that those kind of
 
00:13:01.829 --> 00:13:01.839 align:start position:0%
remain in the healthare system but but
 
00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:04.160 align:start position:0%
it's also present in um the public
 
00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:06.040 align:start position:0%
health system you know there was a lot
 
00:13:08.949 --> 00:13:08.959 align:start position:0%
of covid-19 funding that was put out
 
00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:12.240 align:start position:0%
there for hospitals for States um and
 
00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:16.120 align:start position:0%
that funding had a time limit on it um
 
00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:18.760 align:start position:0%
and when that funding goes away some of
 
00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:20.320 align:start position:0%
the people that were hired to do
 
00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:23.320 align:start position:0%
outbreak investigations for example are
 
00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:27.240 align:start position:0%
going away and so that that um on just a
 
00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:29.480 align:start position:0%
routine basis that impacts our ability
 
00:13:31.829 --> 00:13:31.839 align:start position:0%
to be able to investigate for example an
 
00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
outbreak of you know influenza or RSV or
 
00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:39.680 align:start position:0%
covid-19 at at a congregate you know
 
00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:41.320 align:start position:0%
setting like a long-term care facility
 
00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:42.440 align:start position:0%
those those are discussions we're
 
00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
actually having internally now um
 
00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:46.680 align:start position:0%
because funding is going away and so
 
00:13:52.509 --> 00:13:52.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:54.680 align:start position:0%
people representative
 
00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:56.720 align:start position:0%
beler thank you madam chair and thank
 
00:13:58.350 --> 00:13:58.360 align:start position:0%
you for being here Dr Chan much
 
00:13:58.360 --> 00:13:59.550 align:start position:0%
you for being here Dr Chan much
appreciated

00:13:59.550 --> 00:13:59.560 align:start position:0%
appreciated
 
00:14:00.749 --> 00:14:00.759 align:start position:0%
um I do have a number of questions I'm
 
00:14:01.829 --> 00:14:01.839 align:start position:0%
sure we'll get to them throughout the
 
00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:06.160 align:start position:0%
morning um I'd like to start with um as
 
00:14:08.189 --> 00:14:08.199 align:start position:0%
you testified you know when a new
 
00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
pandemic arises there is different goals
 
00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:12.680 align:start position:0%
that are going to occur at different
 
00:14:13.829 --> 00:14:13.839 align:start position:0%
points in time and that's one of the
 
00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
things we're trying to identify is sort
 
00:14:18.629 --> 00:14:18.639 align:start position:0%
of when did the goals sort of change so
 
00:14:20.509 --> 00:14:20.519 align:start position:0%
I guess the first question is obviously
 
00:14:22.949 --> 00:14:22.959 align:start position:0%
CO's new on the scene we don't have a
 
00:14:26.509 --> 00:14:26.519 align:start position:0%
lot of good information right away um I
 
00:14:29.269 --> 00:14:29.279 align:start position:0%
remember way back in you know January
 
00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:32.360 align:start position:0%
ish maybe February of 2020 hearing
 
00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:34.120 align:start position:0%
things like you know this thing has an
 
00:14:37.749 --> 00:14:37.759 align:start position:0%
rot value of six or seven this thing may
 
00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:40.440 align:start position:0%
have a case fatality rate of four to 5%
 
00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:42.240 align:start position:0%
so a lot of lot of information was there
 
00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
at the time that was kind of sketchy um
 
00:14:47.749 --> 00:14:47.759 align:start position:0%
at what point did it
 
00:14:53.629 --> 00:14:53.639 align:start position:0%
become apparent uh that the initial goal
 
00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:56.720 align:start position:0%
of containment was no longer a
 
00:14:59.230 --> 00:14:59.240 align:start position:0%
reasonable expectation yeah yeah
 
00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
representative that's a great question
 
00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:03.240 align:start position:0%
and um just to clarify my my exact time
 
00:15:05.069 --> 00:15:05.079 align:start position:0%
frame here is going to be a little bit
 
00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:07.480 align:start position:0%
off this was like four or five years ago
 
00:15:09.269 --> 00:15:09.279 align:start position:0%
um but you're absolutely right uh we
 
00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:11.800 align:start position:0%
were learning about this so this not
 
00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
this virus did not first emerge in the
 
00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:15.560 align:start position:0%
United States right it first emerged in
 
00:15:17.829 --> 00:15:17.839 align:start position:0%
China um and the flow of information
 
00:15:19.509 --> 00:15:19.519 align:start position:0%
from some of these other countries was
 
00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
was difficult right we we didn't have
 
00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:23.800 align:start position:0%
real-time situational awareness or
 
00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:27.720 align:start position:0%
knowledge um and so you know what what
 
00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:29.440 align:start position:0%
we what happened was we we watched it
 
00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:31.800 align:start position:0%
march across the globe first in China
 
00:15:33.749 --> 00:15:33.759 align:start position:0%
and there were reports coming out about
 
00:15:36.309 --> 00:15:36.319 align:start position:0%
you know field hospitals having to be
 
00:15:38.069 --> 00:15:38.079 align:start position:0%
set up in China because the Health Care
 
00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
system was overwhelmed and then it you
 
00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:42.360 align:start position:0%
know made its way over to Europe and uh
 
00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:44.040 align:start position:0%
I think many of us remember the stories
 
00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:46.600 align:start position:0%
of what was happening in Italy in
 
00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:50.240 align:start position:0%
particular um you know overwhelmed
 
00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:51.560 align:start position:0%
Health Care Systems and then when it
 
00:15:55.069 --> 00:15:55.079 align:start position:0%
came to the US um you know it was
 
00:15:57.749 --> 00:15:57.759 align:start position:0%
emerging in more population dense areas
 
00:16:00.389 --> 00:16:00.399 align:start position:0%
like New York City where you know I I I
 
00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:02.720 align:start position:0%
remember there needing there was stories
 
00:16:05.309 --> 00:16:05.319 align:start position:0%
about them using Central Park to you
 
00:16:07.629 --> 00:16:07.639 align:start position:0%
know as temporary burial sites because
 
00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:09.560 align:start position:0%
the hospital morgs were overwhelmed
 
00:16:12.189 --> 00:16:12.199 align:start position:0%
right so so that was all that that was
 
00:16:13.949 --> 00:16:13.959 align:start position:0%
we were watching this happen here in New
 
00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire waiting for it to arrive um
 
00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
yet with limited information because a
 
00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
lot of what was happening was in other
 
00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:23.160 align:start position:0%
countries and so it wasn't until the
 
00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:26.240 align:start position:0%
virus arrived here that we were able to
 
00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
learn better how it spreads um but even
 
00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:32.360 align:start position:0%
with that limited information the
 
00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:35.440 align:start position:0%
initial goal was Containment right test
 
00:16:38.749 --> 00:16:38.759 align:start position:0%
people identify infection you know uh
 
00:16:42.949 --> 00:16:42.959 align:start position:0%
containment you know um that our first
 
00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:47.240 align:start position:0%
case was March 2nd of
 
00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
2020 and we were in that mode of
 
00:16:53.309 --> 00:16:53.319 align:start position:0%
containment for you know the time frame
 
00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:55.800 align:start position:0%
here is on the order of weeks to a few
 
00:16:59.509 --> 00:16:59.519 align:start position:0%
months and we were discussing
 
00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:02.800 align:start position:0%
individual cases every evening running
 
00:17:05.309 --> 00:17:05.319 align:start position:0%
what we call line lists you know talking
 
00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:09.240 align:start position:0%
about um you know person a had it doing
 
00:17:10.909 --> 00:17:10.919 align:start position:0%
contact tracing to identify the other
 
00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:12.520 align:start position:0%
people that might have been exposed
 
00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
reaching out to person a to make sure
 
00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:16.400 align:start position:0%
they were isolating and then the other
 
00:17:18.029 --> 00:17:18.039 align:start position:0%
close contacts so that they could you
 
00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:23.160 align:start position:0%
know quarantine um and it it's a it's a
 
00:17:27.029 --> 00:17:27.039 align:start position:0%
Time intensive effort to do that type of
 
00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:30.720 align:start position:0%
case investigation and contact tracing
 
00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:33.200 align:start position:0%
um but we were at it for weeks and
 
00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
months but probably so the first case
 
00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:39.200 align:start position:0%
emerged beginning of March you know
 
00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:42.640 align:start position:0%
through um April May I I mean I would
 
00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
say by you know the beginning of
 
00:17:47.789 --> 00:17:47.799 align:start position:0%
summertime and these are rough estimates
 
00:17:50.029 --> 00:17:50.039 align:start position:0%
it it was clear that you know this was
 
00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:53.960 align:start position:0%
not a virus that could be
 
00:17:58.310 --> 00:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
contained um and that's when we were
 
00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:01.000 align:start position:0%
moving more towards mitigation or
 
00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:03.080 align:start position:0%
messaging at least publicly more about
 
00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:05.960 align:start position:0%
the need for mitigation so it was no
 
00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:08.320 align:start position:0%
longer just about testing and
 
00:18:10.549 --> 00:18:10.559 align:start position:0%
identifying infections and contact
 
00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
tracing and containment um we were
 
00:18:15.789 --> 00:18:15.799 align:start position:0%
moving towards what we call mitigation
 
00:18:17.669 --> 00:18:17.679 align:start position:0%
um and that's that sort of Swiss Cheese
 
00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:20.360 align:start position:0%
model if you will um and I I forget
 
00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:21.640 align:start position:0%
exactly when we started talking about
 
00:18:23.029 --> 00:18:23.039 align:start position:0%
the Swiss Cheese model might have been
 
00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
you know April or or or may but we we
 
00:18:28.029 --> 00:18:28.039 align:start position:0%
started talking about steps that people
 
00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:30.640 align:start position:0%
can take has a comprehensive package to
 
00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
slow the spread of this virus and this
 
00:18:35.789 --> 00:18:35.799 align:start position:0%
was also publicly messaged at one of the
 
00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:37.480 align:start position:0%
governor's press conferences we had a
 
00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:39.200 align:start position:0%
PowerPoint you know little PowerPoint
 
00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:40.960 align:start position:0%
slides we put up showing the goal of
 
00:18:43.669 --> 00:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
mitigation was to slow the spread
 
00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:45.880 align:start position:0%
decrease the peak you know decrease the
 
00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:47.480 align:start position:0%
burden on the Health Care system and I
 
00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:50.440 align:start position:0%
forget exactly when that was um but but
 
00:18:53.789 --> 00:18:53.799 align:start position:0%
that mitigation involved steps like
 
00:18:55.390 --> 00:18:55.400 align:start position:0%
physical distancing you know staying
 
00:18:58.470 --> 00:18:58.480 align:start position:0%
home when you're sick you know um masks
 
00:19:01.669 --> 00:19:01.679 align:start position:0%
fact in it at some point it it might
 
00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:04.400 align:start position:0%
have been May when we were talking about
 
00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
wearing masks a lot of that initial
 
00:19:08.789 --> 00:19:08.799 align:start position:0%
messaging though was wearing masks when
 
00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
people went into the Health Care System
 
00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:12.280 align:start position:0%
right it was focused on protecting the
 
00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
Health Care System um and you know good
 
00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
hand hygiene you know avoiding large
 
00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
Gatherings you know being outdoors as
 
00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
being as being safer than being indoors
 
00:19:25.909 --> 00:19:25.919 align:start position:0%
that that was all um I think messaging
 
00:19:29.029 --> 00:19:29.039 align:start position:0%
that we were rolling out end of spring
 
00:19:31.789 --> 00:19:31.799 align:start position:0%
beginning of summer yet we were still
 
00:19:35.789 --> 00:19:35.799 align:start position:0%
also engaged in the in the um contact
 
00:19:37.549 --> 00:19:37.559 align:start position:0%
tracing and containment strategy and so
 
00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:39.440 align:start position:0%
there's overlap between the two phases
 
00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
right we're doing containment well that
 
00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:43.400 align:start position:0%
that phases out you know we're we're
 
00:19:45.029 --> 00:19:45.039 align:start position:0%
increasing some of the the messaging
 
00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:49.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:51.880 align:start position:0%
measures and and can I I'm sorry can I
 
00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
add one more thing that
 
00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:56.720 align:start position:0%
um and and I think we we were all
 
00:19:59.909 --> 00:19:59.919 align:start position:0%
waiting for a vaccine to come come out
 
00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:02.440 align:start position:0%
because that was another huge transition
 
00:20:04.789 --> 00:20:04.799 align:start position:0%
point in the goals and the objectives
 
00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
vaccination allowed us to um ease up on
 
00:20:10.789 --> 00:20:10.799 align:start position:0%
some of those recommendations and just
 
00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:12.320 align:start position:0%
as an example of that you know the
 
00:20:14.789 --> 00:20:14.799 align:start position:0%
vaccine became available middle to end
 
00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
of December
 
00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:20.360 align:start position:0%
2020 um you know so like 8 10 months
 
00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
into the
 
00:20:25.669 --> 00:20:25.679 align:start position:0%
response and it was I think in January
 
00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:27.440 align:start position:0%
when we came out with the recommendation
 
00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
that you know people that are vac inated
 
00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
who might be exposed to covid-19 do not
 
00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:34.600 align:start position:0%
need to quarantine right and so that was
 
00:20:36.669 --> 00:20:36.679 align:start position:0%
that was a huge step and New Hampshire
 
00:20:38.549 --> 00:20:38.559 align:start position:0%
actually took that step well before the
 
00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:40.640 align:start position:0%
federal government ended up taking that
 
00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
step but at that time the data we had
 
00:20:45.029 --> 00:20:45.039 align:start position:0%
pointed to a highly effective vaccine
 
00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:47.000 align:start position:0%
the clinical trials were showing that
 
00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
the vaccines were 95% effective at
 
00:20:52.669 --> 00:20:52.679 align:start position:0%
preventing infection not just more
 
00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
severe disease um and so we used that
 
00:20:58.750 --> 00:20:58.760 align:start position:0%
initial data to change
 
00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
the goals of the response to relying
 
00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:04.440 align:start position:0%
more and more on the Therapeutics like
 
00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
vaccination um to be able to pull back
 
00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:09.400 align:start position:0%
on some of those mitigation measures so
 
00:21:10.909 --> 00:21:10.919 align:start position:0%
so if I had to frame this big picture it
 
00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:13.240 align:start position:0%
would be you know initial stages weeks
 
00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:16.240 align:start position:0%
to two or three months like pure
 
00:21:18.549 --> 00:21:18.559 align:start position:0%
containment became very clear very
 
00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
quickly that wasn't possible so then we
 
00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
moved to slowing the spread
 
00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:25.400 align:start position:0%
mitigation and ultimately the goal was
 
00:21:27.149 --> 00:21:27.159 align:start position:0%
always to rely more and more on
 
00:21:30.029 --> 00:21:30.039 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical intervention
 
00:21:32.789 --> 00:21:32.799 align:start position:0%
vacc vaccines monoclonal antibodies
 
00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:35.720 align:start position:0%
antiviral medications to be able to then
 
00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:38.840 align:start position:0%
pull back on the the recommendations for
 
00:21:41.269 --> 00:21:41.279 align:start position:0%
the mitigation measures and rely more on
 
00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
protection from natural immunity from
 
00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:46.120 align:start position:0%
vaccination with the availability of
 
00:21:47.789 --> 00:21:47.799 align:start position:0%
Therapeutics for people that became
 
00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:50.200 align:start position:0%
infected for example so I'm I'm sorry to
 
00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:51.720 align:start position:0%
add that at the end I just wanted to add
 
00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:53.720 align:start position:0%
that last piece oh no I appreciate it I
 
00:21:56.710 --> 00:21:56.720 align:start position:0%
mean the more data we get the better we
 
00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
can understand what's going on and move
 
00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:03.440 align:start position:0%
forward uh in the future right so um I
 
00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
do have a question on something that you
 
00:22:07.669 --> 00:22:07.679 align:start position:0%
you said is you know when we're
 
00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
monitoring and in the
 
00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:13.640 align:start position:0%
containment section of the covid um do
 
00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:17.080 align:start position:0%
we do you have numbers of the age groups
 
00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
of people that were really being
 
00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
affected um uh do you know what the age
 
00:22:26.029 --> 00:22:26.039 align:start position:0%
groups were and how you know because you
 
00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:28.200 align:start position:0%
have you know infant to five you have
 
00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:31.640 align:start position:0%
teen you have you know 20s to 30s 30s to
 
00:22:33.909 --> 00:22:33.919 align:start position:0%
40s do we have you know we know the
 
00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
elderly was really affected but do we
 
00:22:39.549 --> 00:22:39.559 align:start position:0%
have any data of how that breakdown
 
00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:41.200 align:start position:0%
happened during the containment yeah
 
00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a good question about uh
 
00:22:45.549 --> 00:22:45.559 align:start position:0%
data and I I I don't I don't know those
 
00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:47.200 align:start position:0%
numbers we were putting those numbers
 
00:22:50.269 --> 00:22:50.279 align:start position:0%
out um on a regular basis either at the
 
00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:52.200 align:start position:0%
press conferences or on the data
 
00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
dashboard that ultimately was stood up
 
00:22:57.230 --> 00:22:57.240 align:start position:0%
that I I think it's still the data
 
00:22:58.549 --> 00:22:58.559 align:start position:0%
dashboard is still up although the dat
 
00:23:01.549 --> 00:23:01.559 align:start position:0%
is paired back um and I think that the
 
00:23:03.789 --> 00:23:03.799 align:start position:0%
data came from a variety of different
 
00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
sources and this actually goes back to
 
00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
my initial comments about the importance
 
00:23:09.789 --> 00:23:09.799 align:start position:0%
of systems data systems for example that
 
00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:12.200 align:start position:0%
that talk with one another um we were
 
00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
getting reports of positive tests so
 
00:23:17.269 --> 00:23:17.279 align:start position:0%
there was test data we were getting
 
00:23:19.149 --> 00:23:19.159 align:start position:0%
reports of people hospitalized with
 
00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
covid-19 so we have you know
 
00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
hospitalization data there's death data
 
00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:25.400 align:start position:0%
from vital that we were getting from
 
00:23:29.029 --> 00:23:29.039 align:start position:0%
Vital Records review um emergency
 
00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:30.640 align:start position:0%
department data so the data was coming
 
00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:32.520 align:start position:0%
in from a variety of different sources
 
00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:34.360 align:start position:0%
and to your question we we were breaking
 
00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
down um that data by like age group for
 
00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
example and I I don't remember those
 
00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:41.640 align:start position:0%
numbers but those had been up on the the
 
00:23:43.149 --> 00:23:43.159 align:start position:0%
data dashboard at one point I think
 
00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
they've since been removed because it's
 
00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:46.120 align:start position:0%
historical data it's like four four
 
00:23:48.789 --> 00:23:48.799 align:start position:0%
years old now
 
00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:51.000 align:start position:0%
um but but you know I would say that
 
00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
there there wasn't one particular age
 
00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
group that was being infected to my
 
00:23:58.909 --> 00:23:58.919 align:start position:0%
recollection more than another I mean
 
00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
this was a novel virus nobody had
 
00:24:03.029 --> 00:24:03.039 align:start position:0%
immunity or protection from it everybody
 
00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:04.840 align:start position:0%
was susceptible to getting infected and
 
00:24:06.909 --> 00:24:06.919 align:start position:0%
everybody was you know regardless of the
 
00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:08.600 align:start position:0%
age group was getting you know infected
 
00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:09.960 align:start position:0%
now certainly there were people that
 
00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:12.400 align:start position:0%
were more susceptible to severe disease
 
00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
and and those are the the PE the
 
00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
individuals that we typically think
 
00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:17.400 align:start position:0%
about as more severe or prone to more
 
00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:19.960 align:start position:0%
severe infection you know older adults
 
00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:22.440 align:start position:0%
people with you know imuno comp imuno
 
00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:23.880 align:start position:0%
people with compromised immune systems
 
00:24:25.669 --> 00:24:25.679 align:start position:0%
people who immuno compromised people on
 
00:24:28.389 --> 00:24:28.399 align:start position:0%
long-term care facilities um were were
 
00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:30.640 align:start position:0%
largely impacted by you know outbreaks
 
00:24:33.909 --> 00:24:33.919 align:start position:0%
so I I think the virus impacted
 
00:24:35.470 --> 00:24:35.480 align:start position:0%
everybody at all age groups but
 
00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
certainly there were populations that um
 
00:24:40.269 --> 00:24:40.279 align:start position:0%
developed more severe
 
00:24:44.669 --> 00:24:44.679 align:start position:0%
disease representative uh P off uh thank
 
00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:46.600 align:start position:0%
you Madame chair and thank you for being
 
00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
here and taking our
 
00:24:53.549 --> 00:24:53.559 align:start position:0%
questions uh so uh about uh uh obviously
 
00:24:56.669 --> 00:24:56.679 align:start position:0%
you were Central person in messaging to
 
00:24:59.470 --> 00:24:59.480 align:start position:0%
the public about uh Co pandemic and
 
00:25:01.950 --> 00:25:01.960 align:start position:0%
treatment so my question is like how
 
00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:05.240 align:start position:0%
this decisions around treatment were
 
00:25:08.389 --> 00:25:08.399 align:start position:0%
made uh uh for New Hampshire how your
 
00:25:12.029 --> 00:25:12.039 align:start position:0%
office was making those decisions so for
 
00:25:16.149 --> 00:25:16.159 align:start position:0%
examples Like Oxygen intubation there
 
00:25:19.909 --> 00:25:19.919 align:start position:0%
was like uh over this years it changed
 
00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:22.720 align:start position:0%
recommendation from putting people on
 
00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
oxygen to maybe moderating
 
00:25:29.789 --> 00:25:29.799 align:start position:0%
it other recommendations uh in my point
 
00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:33.480 align:start position:0%
of view maybe could be questioned like
 
00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
uh that people were say said to stay at
 
00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:40.520 align:start position:0%
home uh if they sick and not receive
 
00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:43.600 align:start position:0%
treatment until they have difficulty
 
00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:46.760 align:start position:0%
breathing for example or decision to
 
00:25:50.149 --> 00:25:50.159 align:start position:0%
bend certain certain cheap antiviral
 
00:25:55.230 --> 00:25:55.240 align:start position:0%
treatments uh but for example V REM that
 
00:25:59.430 --> 00:25:59.440 align:start position:0%
was um showed not a as good safety
 
00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:04.360 align:start position:0%
comparing um to Ebola pandemic Ebola
 
00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:07.880 align:start position:0%
outbreak but then it was recommended and
 
00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:11.440 align:start position:0%
so like when you when you make decisions
 
00:26:15.029 --> 00:26:15.039 align:start position:0%
about treatment some of those decisions
 
00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:18.440 align:start position:0%
are uh message to public some of those
 
00:26:20.549 --> 00:26:20.559 align:start position:0%
decisions directly implemented on
 
00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:23.480 align:start position:0%
Hospital levels but could you understand
 
00:26:26.190 --> 00:26:26.200 align:start position:0%
me how your office and how New Hampshire
 
00:26:29.230 --> 00:26:29.240 align:start position:0%
makes uh those decisions yeah thank you
 
00:26:30.269 --> 00:26:30.279 align:start position:0%
representative for the question about
 
00:26:33.669 --> 00:26:33.679 align:start position:0%
treatment so let me um make a few points
 
00:26:37.669 --> 00:26:37.679 align:start position:0%
up front first um our message for people
 
00:26:42.549 --> 00:26:42.559 align:start position:0%
that were sick um was not to uh and I I
 
00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
think I maybe I misheard you was not to
 
00:26:47.950 --> 00:26:47.960 align:start position:0%
stay home until disease worsened our
 
00:26:50.590 --> 00:26:50.600 align:start position:0%
message around you know illness was if
 
00:26:52.549 --> 00:26:52.559 align:start position:0%
people become sick they they should call
 
00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:54.320 align:start position:0%
their healthc care provider before going
 
00:26:56.029 --> 00:26:56.039 align:start position:0%
in so that there a sick person isn't
 
00:26:58.230 --> 00:26:58.240 align:start position:0%
like sitting in the waiting room but but
 
00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
but certainly people that are sick may
 
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.110 align:start position:0%
but certainly people that are sick may
need

00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
need
 
00:27:05.029 --> 00:27:05.039 align:start position:0%
evaluation um so you know it was never
 
00:27:07.149 --> 00:27:07.159 align:start position:0%
our recommendation or messaging that
 
00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
people should wait until they develop
 
00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
more severe disease to go in um that
 
00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:15.240 align:start position:0%
that is potentially waiting too long for
 
00:27:19.549 --> 00:27:19.559 align:start position:0%
you know needed therapy um but there was
 
00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
a need to try and prevent exposures in a
 
00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
waiting room for example and so
 
00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:25.240 align:start position:0%
Healthcare Systems had to set up
 
00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
processes so that people that were
 
00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:29.360 align:start position:0%
symptomatic weren't s you know sick and
 
00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:31.360 align:start position:0%
sitting in a waiting room exposing other
 
00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:34.440 align:start position:0%
people um so I think some of your
 
00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
questions are are not um or some of your
 
00:27:38.789 --> 00:27:38.799 align:start position:0%
examples are are not the purview
 
00:27:41.269 --> 00:27:41.279 align:start position:0%
necessarily of Public Health so when
 
00:27:43.909 --> 00:27:43.919 align:start position:0%
you're talking about um supportive care
 
00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:46.240 align:start position:0%
you know how to ventilate somebody you
 
00:27:47.909 --> 00:27:47.919 align:start position:0%
know how to give them
 
00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:51.320 align:start position:0%
oxygen um how to you know if they're in
 
00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:53.440 align:start position:0%
the ICU and on a ventilator do you lay
 
00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
them on their back or do you lay them on
 
00:27:56.950 --> 00:27:56.960 align:start position:0%
their stomach you know prone positioning
 
00:27:59.350 --> 00:27:59.360 align:start position:0%
was a big you know top in in some of the
 
00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:01.960 align:start position:0%
early days how best to you know support
 
00:28:03.909 --> 00:28:03.919 align:start position:0%
somebody who's infected and has more
 
00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:06.720 align:start position:0%
severe disease that's that's the Health
 
00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
Care System that's the hospital deciding
 
00:28:11.710 --> 00:28:11.720 align:start position:0%
based on
 
00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
um uh Health Care Society you know
 
00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:16.720 align:start position:0%
recommendations for example right
 
00:28:18.389 --> 00:28:18.399 align:start position:0%
there's like an infectious disease
 
00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
Society of America there's a soci uh
 
00:28:23.909 --> 00:28:23.919 align:start position:0%
Critical Care Medicine group that puts
 
00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
out you know recommendations on how best
 
00:28:27.389 --> 00:28:27.399 align:start position:0%
to care for various people and the
 
00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:29.880 align:start position:0%
critical care setting right so so some
 
00:28:32.389 --> 00:28:32.399 align:start position:0%
some of that stuff was was really in the
 
00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:34.120 align:start position:0%
purview of the healthc care system in
 
00:28:36.310 --> 00:28:36.320 align:start position:0%
the hospital to to stay up to date on
 
00:28:39.669 --> 00:28:39.679 align:start position:0%
and to implement where um the state
 
00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:43.200 align:start position:0%
comes in is when there are
 
00:28:47.789 --> 00:28:47.799 align:start position:0%
um novel pharmaceutical interventions
 
00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:51.240 align:start position:0%
Therapeutics um right so monoclonal
 
00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:54.320 align:start position:0%
antibodies were quickly developed and I
 
00:28:57.149 --> 00:28:57.159 align:start position:0%
can't remember the exact time frame for
 
00:28:59.269 --> 00:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
um being being able to give people
 
00:29:03.029 --> 00:29:03.039 align:start position:0%
infected a an antibody infusion to help
 
00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
prevent you know severe disease there
 
00:29:10.110 --> 00:29:10.120 align:start position:0%
was also um direct antivirus medications
 
00:29:12.029 --> 00:29:12.039 align:start position:0%
like REM dese which could only be
 
00:29:12.039 --> 00:29:13.470 align:start position:0%
like REM dese which could only be
administered

00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:13.480 align:start position:0%
administered
 
00:29:16.750 --> 00:29:16.760 align:start position:0%
intravenously um and so that uh those
 
00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:19.080 align:start position:0%
were typically early on administered
 
00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
just in the hospital setting um then
 
00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:25.080 align:start position:0%
later on
 
00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:28.960 align:start position:0%
uh uh probably 2021 sometime sorry my
 
00:29:31.789 --> 00:29:31.799 align:start position:0%
time frame is not clear here you know
 
00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:34.480 align:start position:0%
you had the the oral pills the antiviral
 
00:29:36.509 --> 00:29:36.519 align:start position:0%
pills that came out like Pax loid in in
 
00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:38.840 align:start position:0%
Mal nirav that could be used in the
 
00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:42.640 align:start position:0%
outpatient setting um so a lot of the
 
00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
work and the messaging that we did
 
00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
around treatments was around these new
 
00:29:51.630 --> 00:29:51.640 align:start position:0%
Therapeutics these new medicines to
 
00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:54.720 align:start position:0%
treat infection monoclonal antibodies
 
00:29:56.990 --> 00:29:57.000 align:start position:0%
and antiviral medications and that
 
00:29:59.830 --> 00:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
consisted of a of a a couple things one
 
00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:02.080 align:start position:0%
was simply messaging Healthcare
 
00:30:04.590 --> 00:30:04.600 align:start position:0%
Providers about what these medications
 
00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
were um where to find resources where to
 
00:30:09.549 --> 00:30:09.559 align:start position:0%
find you know what the studies were
 
00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
showing about their effectiveness or
 
00:30:14.149 --> 00:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
efficacy um pointing them
 
00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:18.240 align:start position:0%
to uh healthc care recommendations that
 
00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:20.120 align:start position:0%
may have been published by like for
 
00:30:21.750 --> 00:30:21.760 align:start position:0%
example the Infectious Disease Society
 
00:30:23.950 --> 00:30:23.960 align:start position:0%
of America or the National Institutes of
 
00:30:27.630 --> 00:30:27.640 align:start position:0%
Health and the NIH um was putting out uh
 
00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:29.640 align:start position:0%
r guidance on how to use some of these
 
00:30:31.710 --> 00:30:31.720 align:start position:0%
treatments so so a lot of this was
 
00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:33.080 align:start position:0%
messaging to healthcare providers
 
00:30:34.509 --> 00:30:34.519 align:start position:0%
pointing them to the resources and the
 
00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:35.840 align:start position:0%
guidance that was available for how to
 
00:30:38.149 --> 00:30:38.159 align:start position:0%
use these um based on the science and
 
00:30:39.909 --> 00:30:39.919 align:start position:0%
the studies that were available the
 
00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:43.640 align:start position:0%
other aspect um was distribution right
 
00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
so these were these were medicines when
 
00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
they're they're new uh they are not
 
00:30:49.269 --> 00:30:49.279 align:start position:0%
available immediately through the
 
00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
commercial Marketplace meaning hospitals
 
00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
can't just and Healthcare Providers
 
00:30:57.070 --> 00:30:57.080 align:start position:0%
can't just go out and purchase them from
 
00:30:59.470 --> 00:30:59.480 align:start position:0%
you know a pharmaceutical company um
 
00:31:02.909 --> 00:31:02.919 align:start position:0%
these were uh medications that were
 
00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
obtained by the federal government and
 
00:31:07.870 --> 00:31:07.880 align:start position:0%
then were
 
00:31:11.909 --> 00:31:11.919 align:start position:0%
allocated in various ways to state
 
00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
public health
 
00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions for further Distribution
 
00:31:19.549 --> 00:31:19.559 align:start position:0%
on um how best to make them
 
00:31:19.559 --> 00:31:21.549 align:start position:0%
on um how best to make them
available

00:31:21.549 --> 00:31:21.559 align:start position:0%
available
 
00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
um that
 
00:31:27.710 --> 00:31:27.720 align:start position:0%
involves so I was I'm trying to think uh
 
00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:29.120 align:start position:0%
m this is where my memory is a little
 
00:31:30.629 --> 00:31:30.639 align:start position:0%
bit hazy there were a lot of people
 
00:31:32.350 --> 00:31:32.360 align:start position:0%
involved in that
 
00:31:36.990 --> 00:31:37.000 align:start position:0%
process um and we have a a whole group
 
00:31:39.549 --> 00:31:39.559 align:start position:0%
in public health uh an emergency
 
00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
preparedness response and Recovery Group
 
00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
um that deals and that deals with
 
00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:49.360 align:start position:0%
working with the federal government
 
00:31:53.710 --> 00:31:53.720 align:start position:0%
whether it's FEMA or asper or CDC or
 
00:31:58.669 --> 00:31:58.679 align:start position:0%
federal HHS on um logistic Ally
 
00:32:01.990 --> 00:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
coordinating distribution of these
 
00:32:03.909 --> 00:32:03.919 align:start position:0%
medications but certainly there there
 
00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:08.360 align:start position:0%
was a whole group focused on
 
00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:11.880 align:start position:0%
um how best to make these medications
 
00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:14.480 align:start position:0%
available and that included working with
 
00:32:16.990 --> 00:32:17.000 align:start position:0%
going back to the original example um
 
00:32:18.350 --> 00:32:18.360 align:start position:0%
working with our Healthcare System to
 
00:32:20.750 --> 00:32:20.760 align:start position:0%
figure out how to deliver for example
 
00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:22.960 align:start position:0%
intravenus from De to somebody that
 
00:32:26.950 --> 00:32:26.960 align:start position:0%
might be might be impacted um later on
 
00:32:28.549 --> 00:32:28.559 align:start position:0%
intravenous REM
 
00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
became available for
 
00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
outpatients not just people
 
00:32:36.029 --> 00:32:36.039 align:start position:0%
hospitalized uh but the fact that it had
 
00:32:37.310 --> 00:32:37.320 align:start position:0%
to be given
 
00:32:40.149 --> 00:32:40.159 align:start position:0%
intravenously was is very difficult for
 
00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:41.960 align:start position:0%
the Health Care system and so you don't
 
00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
see that medication being used very much
 
00:32:46.350 --> 00:32:46.360 align:start position:0%
in the outpatient setting um so it's a
 
00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:48.360 align:start position:0%
good thing we have the oral pills like
 
00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:51.240 align:start position:0%
Pax lovid and Mal the PIR um that are
 
00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
that are still available for outpatient
 
00:32:58.669 --> 00:32:58.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher then
 
00:33:04.230 --> 00:33:04.240 align:start position:0%
representative thank you madam chair um
 
00:33:07.310 --> 00:33:07.320 align:start position:0%
just to make sure there's no confusion
 
00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
on the issue of
 
00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
mitigation would I be correct in
 
00:33:14.190 --> 00:33:14.200 align:start position:0%
characterizing the overriding goal of
 
00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:15.789 align:start position:0%
characterizing the overriding goal of
mitigation

00:33:15.789 --> 00:33:15.799 align:start position:0%
mitigation
 
00:33:18.549 --> 00:33:18.559 align:start position:0%
as uh preventing the overwhelming of
 
00:33:21.070 --> 00:33:21.080 align:start position:0%
hospitals overall waiting for new
 
00:33:23.149 --> 00:33:23.159 align:start position:0%
Therapeutics to come online to reduce
 
00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
morbidity mortality waiting for
 
00:33:27.389 --> 00:33:27.399 align:start position:0%
vaccination and were there any other um
 
00:33:30.750 --> 00:33:30.760 align:start position:0%
over writing goals to mitigation yeah so
 
00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
so I think what you said is correct um a
 
00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:36.480 align:start position:0%
central Focus was uh preventing the
 
00:33:38.149 --> 00:33:38.159 align:start position:0%
Health Care system from being
 
00:33:40.590 --> 00:33:40.600 align:start position:0%
overwhelmed we saw that happen in other
 
00:33:43.269 --> 00:33:43.279 align:start position:0%
countries right like Italy I mean even
 
00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:45.760 align:start position:0%
in our country in New York City um
 
00:33:47.350 --> 00:33:47.360 align:start position:0%
partly I think because of the population
 
00:33:49.470 --> 00:33:49.480 align:start position:0%
density but that was certainly a central
 
00:33:53.310 --> 00:33:53.320 align:start position:0%
goal is to um so the the way we talked
 
00:33:55.269 --> 00:33:55.279 align:start position:0%
about mitigation was
 
00:33:58.669 --> 00:33:58.679 align:start position:0%
to um slow the
 
00:34:01.269 --> 00:34:01.279 align:start position:0%
spread so slow how quickly it's
 
00:34:02.789 --> 00:34:02.799 align:start position:0%
spreading from person to person so you
 
00:34:06.509 --> 00:34:06.519 align:start position:0%
know decrease that or not if you will um
 
00:34:08.629 --> 00:34:08.639 align:start position:0%
lower the peak so we don't have such a
 
00:34:11.069 --> 00:34:11.079 align:start position:0%
huge Spike and decrease the burden on
 
00:34:15.149 --> 00:34:15.159 align:start position:0%
the Health Care System um and that in
 
00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:19.280 align:start position:0%
turn would help um prevent the morbidity
 
00:34:22.030 --> 00:34:22.040 align:start position:0%
and mortality that you're referring to
 
00:34:24.270 --> 00:34:24.280 align:start position:0%
right the the there were issues all
 
00:34:25.629 --> 00:34:25.639 align:start position:0%
throughout the pandemic of people
 
00:34:27.349 --> 00:34:27.359 align:start position:0%
accessing the the health routine
 
00:34:29.990 --> 00:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
healthare care services you know even to
 
00:34:31.790 --> 00:34:31.800 align:start position:0%
this day we're still hearing reports
 
00:34:34.430 --> 00:34:34.440 align:start position:0%
about you know how cancer incidents
 
00:34:36.270 --> 00:34:36.280 align:start position:0%
might have got might have gone up
 
00:34:37.710 --> 00:34:37.720 align:start position:0%
because people weren't seeking regular
 
00:34:40.510 --> 00:34:40.520 align:start position:0%
screenings for you know for cancer um
 
00:34:42.389 --> 00:34:42.399 align:start position:0%
people weren't going into the hospital
 
00:34:45.430 --> 00:34:45.440 align:start position:0%
for you know cardiac issues right and so
 
00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
there are Downstream consequences of you
 
00:34:50.389 --> 00:34:50.399 align:start position:0%
know strain on the Health Care system
 
00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:51.720 align:start position:0%
which impacts other aspects
 
00:34:53.149 --> 00:34:53.159 align:start position:0%
non-infectious disease aspects of
 
00:34:53.159 --> 00:34:54.750 align:start position:0%
non-infectious disease aspects of
people's

00:34:54.750 --> 00:34:54.760 align:start position:0%
people's
 
00:34:58.310 --> 00:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
Health represent mcarter
 
00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thanks for coming
 
00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
this morning um can you try uh to give
 
00:35:06.349 --> 00:35:06.359 align:start position:0%
us a picture of the
 
00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:10.160 align:start position:0%
rationale um vaccinating young children
 
00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
can you can you walk me through what the
 
00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:15.680 align:start position:0%
uh what that looks like on your
 
00:35:18.270 --> 00:35:18.280 align:start position:0%
professional level in your department of
 
00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
making recommendations to continue to
 
00:35:24.550 --> 00:35:24.560 align:start position:0%
vaccinate children against covid where
 
00:35:27.150 --> 00:35:27.160 align:start position:0%
I've perhaps I'm wrong someone can
 
00:35:29.790 --> 00:35:29.800 align:start position:0%
correct me I've been unable to obtain
 
00:35:33.630 --> 00:35:33.640 align:start position:0%
any study that shows that there's been
 
00:35:37.109 --> 00:35:37.119 align:start position:0%
some data to demonstrate the efficacy of
 
00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:39.160 align:start position:0%
vaccinating young children can you can
 
00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:40.720 align:start position:0%
you walk us through how your department
 
00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
comes to that recommendation still to
 
00:35:46.510 --> 00:35:46.520 align:start position:0%
this day yeah so um first off vaccine
 
00:35:47.870 --> 00:35:47.880 align:start position:0%
approval and
 
00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
recommendations uh at a federal level
 
00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:52.720 align:start position:0%
happens through a process by which it's
 
00:35:56.309 --> 00:35:56.319 align:start position:0%
reviewed by the FDA for safety and
 
00:35:58.589 --> 00:35:58.599 align:start position:0%
efficacy and then it for this is for
 
00:36:02.030 --> 00:36:02.040 align:start position:0%
like regulatory approval or
 
00:36:04.270 --> 00:36:04.280 align:start position:0%
authorization and then it goes to a
 
00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:06.040 align:start position:0%
group The advisory committee on
 
00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
immunization practices or acip which is
 
00:36:11.309 --> 00:36:11.319 align:start position:0%
an advisory committee that puts out um
 
00:36:13.790 --> 00:36:13.800 align:start position:0%
healthc care provider recommendations so
 
00:36:18.349 --> 00:36:18.359 align:start position:0%
how to use these um vaccines in a um
 
00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:21.520 align:start position:0%
safe and scientifically responsible way
 
00:36:23.710 --> 00:36:23.720 align:start position:0%
uh this is a group of medical
 
00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:25.960 align:start position:0%
professionals that come together to you
 
00:36:28.150 --> 00:36:28.160 align:start position:0%
know which includes Pediatric infectious
 
00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
disease experts for example and there's
 
00:36:32.349 --> 00:36:32.359 align:start position:0%
a whole I mean you can Google acip and
 
00:36:33.990 --> 00:36:34.000 align:start position:0%
see all the the representation that
 
00:36:37.309 --> 00:36:37.319 align:start position:0%
weighs in on you know medical guidance
 
00:36:40.670 --> 00:36:40.680 align:start position:0%
um and so they go through a process of
 
00:36:42.910 --> 00:36:42.920 align:start position:0%
reviewing the science that's out there
 
00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:44.560 align:start position:0%
around both the safety and the
 
00:36:47.069 --> 00:36:47.079 align:start position:0%
effectiveness of vaccines and they have
 
00:36:49.349 --> 00:36:49.359 align:start position:0%
a whole evidence to recommendation
 
00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:52.480 align:start position:0%
framework what they call the ETR um
 
00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:53.920 align:start position:0%
where they go through questions about
 
00:36:57.150 --> 00:36:57.160 align:start position:0%
safety and efficacy and um there's a
 
00:37:00.430 --> 00:37:00.440 align:start position:0%
whole standardized process for reviewing
 
00:37:04.430 --> 00:37:04.440 align:start position:0%
vaccination data um and how to frame
 
00:37:06.430 --> 00:37:06.440 align:start position:0%
recommendations based on the science
 
00:37:09.829 --> 00:37:09.839 align:start position:0%
that's available um so the covid-19
 
00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
vaccines went through this process um we
 
00:37:16.430 --> 00:37:16.440 align:start position:0%
were tuning in also to these meetings
 
00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:19.560 align:start position:0%
and so also we're so we don't we didn't
 
00:37:22.069 --> 00:37:22.079 align:start position:0%
have a seat at the table per se but the
 
00:37:24.109 --> 00:37:24.119 align:start position:0%
the the meetings are publicly available
 
00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:27.640 align:start position:0%
for anybody to to view and you know the
 
00:37:29.470 --> 00:37:29.480 align:start position:0%
the PowerPoint slides the data for
 
00:37:31.270 --> 00:37:31.280 align:start position:0%
example that's presented is all publicly
 
00:37:34.309 --> 00:37:34.319 align:start position:0%
available for people to review um and so
 
00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:36.880 align:start position:0%
we were you know not only ourselves
 
00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:38.520 align:start position:0%
reviewing the scientific studies that
 
00:37:40.069 --> 00:37:40.079 align:start position:0%
were coming out about the safety and
 
00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:42.640 align:start position:0%
efficacy of vaccines we were also tuning
 
00:37:47.430 --> 00:37:47.440 align:start position:0%
into these AIP meetings um to um listen
 
00:37:49.990 --> 00:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
to the deliberation and the discussion
 
00:37:52.190 --> 00:37:52.200 align:start position:0%
uh from these National medical experts
 
00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
around vaccine safety and vaccine
 
00:37:56.309 --> 00:37:56.319 align:start position:0%
efficacy which is which ultimately is
 
00:37:58.030 --> 00:37:58.040 align:start position:0%
what influenced vaccine
 
00:38:00.630 --> 00:38:00.640 align:start position:0%
recommendations um just to be clear
 
00:38:04.589 --> 00:38:04.599 align:start position:0%
sometimes the FDA authorizes or approves
 
00:38:08.030 --> 00:38:08.040 align:start position:0%
a vaccine for one indication but the
 
00:38:09.790 --> 00:38:09.800 align:start position:0%
medical group that makes the
 
00:38:12.190 --> 00:38:12.200 align:start position:0%
recommendations acip takes a different
 
00:38:13.870 --> 00:38:13.880 align:start position:0%
tact based on you know what they're
 
00:38:16.589 --> 00:38:16.599 align:start position:0%
seeing in the data um I will also say
 
00:38:18.829 --> 00:38:18.839 align:start position:0%
that you know we New Hampshire um
 
00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:20.640 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:23.200 align:start position:0%
put out our own science memo science
 
00:38:25.630 --> 00:38:25.640 align:start position:0%
brief around vaccination particularly in
 
00:38:27.910 --> 00:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
in children highlighting the science and
 
00:38:33.829 --> 00:38:33.839 align:start position:0%
the data uh that was 20 that was uh fall
 
00:38:33.839 --> 00:38:34.870 align:start position:0%
the data uh that was 20 that was uh fall
of

00:38:34.870 --> 00:38:34.880 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:38:38.069 --> 00:38:38.079 align:start position:0%
2022 um we made that available to the
 
00:38:39.589 --> 00:38:39.599 align:start position:0%
legislature I think this actually came
 
00:38:40.910 --> 00:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
up in
 
00:38:44.510 --> 00:38:44.520 align:start position:0%
discussions with uh I'm going to look
 
00:38:46.109 --> 00:38:46.119 align:start position:0%
back here was it
 
00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:48.800 align:start position:0%
Finance it was finance and so we made
 
00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:52.960 align:start position:0%
that um document available to uh the the
 
00:38:56.870 --> 00:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
legislators in um the finance group um
 
00:38:58.670 --> 00:38:58.680 align:start position:0%
but that is
 
00:39:00.990 --> 00:39:01.000 align:start position:0%
somewhere still available on the website
 
00:39:02.550 --> 00:39:02.560 align:start position:0%
so so we should highlight some of the
 
00:39:04.309 --> 00:39:04.319 align:start position:0%
the questions and the concerns you have
 
00:39:05.670 --> 00:39:05.680 align:start position:0%
about the studies and the science and
 
00:39:08.990 --> 00:39:09.000 align:start position:0%
the rationale behind it um I just want
 
00:39:11.309 --> 00:39:11.319 align:start position:0%
to say that I have here it says the FDA
 
00:39:15.069 --> 00:39:15.079 align:start position:0%
authorizes the covid-19 vaccine for ages
 
00:39:18.069 --> 00:39:18.079 align:start position:0%
uh 5 to 11 on October 29th
 
00:39:21.630 --> 00:39:21.640 align:start position:0%
2021 and for ages 6 months to 5 years on
 
00:39:23.309 --> 00:39:23.319 align:start position:0%
June 18th of
 
00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:26.480 align:start position:0%
2022 uh just uh so everyone knows what
 
00:39:27.870 --> 00:39:27.880 align:start position:0%
the dates were
 
00:39:31.790 --> 00:39:31.800 align:start position:0%
where the FDA uh did that um
 
00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:34.069 align:start position:0%
where the FDA uh did that um
representative

00:39:34.069 --> 00:39:34.079 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:39:36.990 --> 00:39:37.000 align:start position:0%
weary thank you chair and thank you Dr
 
00:39:39.270 --> 00:39:39.280 align:start position:0%
Chan for taking my question
 
00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
um is it it's a little soft a little
 
00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
soft sorry
 
00:39:49.790 --> 00:39:49.800 align:start position:0%
um so how did the emergency youth
 
00:39:52.750 --> 00:39:52.760 align:start position:0%
authorization of the vaccines play into
 
00:39:56.430 --> 00:39:56.440 align:start position:0%
the decisionmaking so obviously they're
 
00:39:57.910 --> 00:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
under a normal
 
00:40:01.309 --> 00:40:01.319 align:start position:0%
release process from the FDA as you
 
00:40:04.030 --> 00:40:04.040 align:start position:0%
described they would have these things
 
00:40:08.470 --> 00:40:08.480 align:start position:0%
um different events and the acip as
 
00:40:11.550 --> 00:40:11.560 align:start position:0%
well but in this circumstance
 
00:40:16.109 --> 00:40:16.119 align:start position:0%
for um the fizer and some of the other
 
00:40:18.990 --> 00:40:19.000 align:start position:0%
companies there was an emergency youth
 
00:40:21.910 --> 00:40:21.920 align:start position:0%
authorization in place how did that
 
00:40:25.829 --> 00:40:25.839 align:start position:0%
affect uh the decision making and what
 
00:40:28.710 --> 00:40:28.720 align:start position:0%
sort of data were you looking at to you
 
00:40:34.150 --> 00:40:34.160 align:start position:0%
know um because this the eua doesn't
 
00:40:38.550 --> 00:40:38.560 align:start position:0%
have the typical Effectiveness and and
 
00:40:40.750 --> 00:40:40.760 align:start position:0%
safety data that you would normally
 
00:40:43.069 --> 00:40:43.079 align:start position:0%
encounter in the approve approval of
 
00:40:45.750 --> 00:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
such vaccines so how did the department
 
00:40:48.030 --> 00:40:48.040 align:start position:0%
analyze that yeah uh thanks for that
 
00:40:49.589 --> 00:40:49.599 align:start position:0%
question about the emergency use
 
00:40:52.230 --> 00:40:52.240 align:start position:0%
authorization process so so disclaimer
 
00:40:54.430 --> 00:40:54.440 align:start position:0%
here I'm not an expert on you know fda's
 
00:40:57.510 --> 00:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
you know regulatory processes or precise
 
00:40:59.870 --> 00:40:59.880 align:start position:0%
is between their authorization and their
 
00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:02.640 align:start position:0%
full approval or lure what what I can
 
00:41:04.270 --> 00:41:04.280 align:start position:0%
say is that
 
00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
um authorization is my understanding is
 
00:41:11.150 --> 00:41:11.160 align:start position:0%
a mechanism to um take data that's
 
00:41:13.589 --> 00:41:13.599 align:start position:0%
available and and make in this case
 
00:41:17.349 --> 00:41:17.359 align:start position:0%
vaccines um more quickly available by
 
00:41:20.069 --> 00:41:20.079 align:start position:0%
cutting red tape that's that was that's
 
00:41:21.390 --> 00:41:21.400 align:start position:0%
that's typically the way we've talked
 
00:41:24.270 --> 00:41:24.280 align:start position:0%
about authorization the the science the
 
00:41:26.589 --> 00:41:26.599 align:start position:0%
studies that were that were required by
 
00:41:28.910 --> 00:41:28.920 align:start position:0%
the FDA to get authorization are the
 
00:41:31.109 --> 00:41:31.119 align:start position:0%
same types of pharmaceutical clinical
 
00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:33.200 align:start position:0%
trials that are required for full
 
00:41:34.870 --> 00:41:34.880 align:start position:0%
licensure or full approval right we're
 
00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
still talking phase three clinical
 
00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:40.160 align:start position:0%
trials with tens of thousands of people
 
00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
the the issue was that
 
00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:45.720 align:start position:0%
um the issue I think there were a couple
 
00:41:48.030 --> 00:41:48.040 align:start position:0%
differences again to my limited
 
00:41:49.870 --> 00:41:49.880 align:start position:0%
understanding one is the amount of
 
00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:52.640 align:start position:0%
paperwork required a pharmaceutical
 
00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:55.240 align:start position:0%
company to submit and the type of review
 
00:41:57.230 --> 00:41:57.240 align:start position:0%
that the FDA does and I'm not an expert
 
00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
exp ERT on that the other difference um
 
00:42:02.670 --> 00:42:02.680 align:start position:0%
was the long-term followup right so
 
00:42:06.790 --> 00:42:06.800 align:start position:0%
these were new vaccines um that had
 
00:42:09.150 --> 00:42:09.160 align:start position:0%
phase three you know large randomized
 
00:42:11.430 --> 00:42:11.440 align:start position:0%
Placebo control double blinded clinical
 
00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
trials associated with it um showing you
 
00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:18.720 align:start position:0%
know that there were no that at a at a
 
00:42:20.670 --> 00:42:20.680 align:start position:0%
you know out of tens of thousands of
 
00:42:22.990 --> 00:42:23.000 align:start position:0%
people there didn't appear to be safety
 
00:42:25.470 --> 00:42:25.480 align:start position:0%
concerns and the vaccine efficacy up
 
00:42:28.190 --> 00:42:28.200 align:start position:0%
front it was you know were showing 9 5%
 
00:42:30.670 --> 00:42:30.680 align:start position:0%
efficacy at preventing infection as I
 
00:42:33.069 --> 00:42:33.079 align:start position:0%
referenced earlier but what wasn't
 
00:42:35.910 --> 00:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
available were were the you know year
 
00:42:38.710 --> 00:42:38.720 align:start position:0%
plus follow-up data and so the
 
00:42:41.950 --> 00:42:41.960 align:start position:0%
authorization allowed the vaccines to be
 
00:42:46.109 --> 00:42:46.119 align:start position:0%
used um well the clinical trials were
 
00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
collecting the longer term you know
 
00:42:51.390 --> 00:42:51.400 align:start position:0%
clinical trial data so so these were
 
00:42:52.670 --> 00:42:52.680 align:start position:0%
clinical trials that went on for at
 
00:42:56.109 --> 00:42:56.119 align:start position:0%
least a couple of years um and so they
 
00:42:58.750 --> 00:42:58.760 align:start position:0%
had data you know initial data on safety
 
00:43:03.230 --> 00:43:03.240 align:start position:0%
and efficacy um over months that they
 
00:43:05.950 --> 00:43:05.960 align:start position:0%
had accumulated but not years and I so I
 
00:43:07.150 --> 00:43:07.160 align:start position:0%
think my understanding is that's one of
 
00:43:11.030 --> 00:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:14.480 align:start position:0%
differences representative
 
00:43:17.230 --> 00:43:17.240 align:start position:0%
mcarter thank you madam chair just as a
 
00:43:20.309 --> 00:43:20.319 align:start position:0%
followup to my previous question are you
 
00:43:22.990 --> 00:43:23.000 align:start position:0%
are you able to point specifically to
 
00:43:28.150 --> 00:43:28.160 align:start position:0%
any studies that have been done that uh
 
00:43:31.510 --> 00:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
um that supports the recommendation
 
00:43:34.910 --> 00:43:34.920 align:start position:0%
continuing today to vaccinate children
 
00:43:37.190 --> 00:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
what what is your department or you in
 
00:43:39.430 --> 00:43:39.440 align:start position:0%
your professional resume you you clearly
 
00:43:41.109 --> 00:43:41.119 align:start position:0%
know more about this sort of stuff than
 
00:43:44.589 --> 00:43:44.599 align:start position:0%
I um what studies can you specifically
 
00:43:46.990 --> 00:43:47.000 align:start position:0%
point to that supports making the
 
00:43:48.790 --> 00:43:48.800 align:start position:0%
recommendation to the public in New
 
00:43:52.870 --> 00:43:52.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to vaccinate children against
 
00:43:56.150 --> 00:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
covid-19 yeah so the the process and the
 
00:43:59.589 --> 00:43:59.599 align:start position:0%
data that I outlined before is still
 
00:43:59.599 --> 00:44:01.349 align:start position:0%
data that I outlined before is still
relevant

00:44:01.349 --> 00:44:01.359 align:start position:0%
relevant
 
00:44:04.870 --> 00:44:04.880 align:start position:0%
um the um you know so I would point you
 
00:44:07.470 --> 00:44:07.480 align:start position:0%
first to the use of these vaccines and
 
00:44:09.390 --> 00:44:09.400 align:start position:0%
the study of these vaccines over the
 
00:44:13.990 --> 00:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
last four four years um the data has
 
00:44:16.470 --> 00:44:16.480 align:start position:0%
accumulated uh it's been presented
 
00:44:18.630 --> 00:44:18.640 align:start position:0%
publicly I would point you to the the
 
00:44:21.230 --> 00:44:21.240 align:start position:0%
science brief that we put out uh with
 
00:44:24.390 --> 00:44:24.400 align:start position:0%
some of that data um you know I will
 
00:44:27.829 --> 00:44:27.839 align:start position:0%
also point out that you know 19 was
 
00:44:31.510 --> 00:44:31.520 align:start position:0%
causing in children uh multi-stem
 
00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:33.030 align:start position:0%
causing in children uh multi-stem
inflammatory

00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
inflammatory
 
00:44:36.230 --> 00:44:36.240 align:start position:0%
syndromes misc multistem inflammatory
 
00:44:38.190 --> 00:44:38.200 align:start position:0%
syndrome and children children were
 
00:44:40.150 --> 00:44:40.160 align:start position:0%
being hospitalized there there's data
 
00:44:42.829 --> 00:44:42.839 align:start position:0%
continuing to this day showing that um
 
00:44:46.670 --> 00:44:46.680 align:start position:0%
co9 contributes to um a higher risk of
 
00:44:50.230 --> 00:44:50.240 align:start position:0%
diabetes in kids for for whatever reason
 
00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
um you know this is specific to Children
 
00:44:56.710 --> 00:44:56.720 align:start position:0%
uh so there are consequences of covid-19
 
00:44:59.190 --> 00:44:59.200 align:start position:0%
still in all age groups including in
 
00:45:02.190 --> 00:45:02.200 align:start position:0%
children with that said um the severity
 
00:45:05.630 --> 00:45:05.640 align:start position:0%
of the disease has lessened um the focus
 
00:45:08.190 --> 00:45:08.200 align:start position:0%
for vaccination um and the highest
 
00:45:10.549 --> 00:45:10.559 align:start position:0%
priority for vaccination is on people
 
00:45:13.790 --> 00:45:13.800 align:start position:0%
that are higher risk uh older adults
 
00:45:15.470 --> 00:45:15.480 align:start position:0%
people with compromised immune systems
 
00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:18.400 align:start position:0%
which includes children uh people with
 
00:45:20.150 --> 00:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
multiple medical problems which also
 
00:45:23.910 --> 00:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
includes children um so there is still a
 
00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
role for um having vaccine available uh
 
00:45:31.870 --> 00:45:31.880 align:start position:0%
for all age groups uh and the the data
 
00:45:34.990 --> 00:45:35.000 align:start position:0%
and the review of the data for example
 
00:45:39.710 --> 00:45:39.720 align:start position:0%
you know through FDA and acip supports
 
00:45:43.069 --> 00:45:43.079 align:start position:0%
that the benefits outweigh risks of
 
00:45:45.790 --> 00:45:45.800 align:start position:0%
vaccination in in all the age groups for
 
00:45:47.870 --> 00:45:47.880 align:start position:0%
which the vaccine is recommended but
 
00:45:49.630 --> 00:45:49.640 align:start position:0%
again at the end of the day this is an
 
00:45:51.710 --> 00:45:51.720 align:start position:0%
individual decision so the the vaccine
 
00:45:53.589 --> 00:45:53.599 align:start position:0%
is is available the recommendations are
 
00:45:56.030 --> 00:45:56.040 align:start position:0%
out there um parents can choose whether
 
00:45:59.349 --> 00:45:59.359 align:start position:0%
or not to get their child vaccinated um
 
00:46:01.470 --> 00:46:01.480 align:start position:0%
the the groups that we are stressing the
 
00:46:04.230 --> 00:46:04.240 align:start position:0%
importance of vaccination um are those
 
00:46:06.910 --> 00:46:06.920 align:start position:0%
higher risk groups which can include
 
00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:08.510 align:start position:0%
higher risk groups which can include
children

00:46:08.510 --> 00:46:08.520 align:start position:0%
children
 
00:46:12.390 --> 00:46:12.400 align:start position:0%
followup thank you madam chair so I I
 
00:46:16.030 --> 00:46:16.040 align:start position:0%
understand the FDA and the other um
 
00:46:17.430 --> 00:46:17.440 align:start position:0%
organization is making the
 
00:46:20.230 --> 00:46:20.240 align:start position:0%
recommendation but can you particularly
 
00:46:24.589 --> 00:46:24.599 align:start position:0%
cite a specific study that supports that
 
00:46:27.190 --> 00:46:27.200 align:start position:0%
recommendation are you able yeah I point
 
00:46:28.910 --> 00:46:28.920 align:start position:0%
you back to the science brief we put out
 
00:46:32.390 --> 00:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:35.430 --> 00:46:35.440 align:start position:0%
ago represent
 
00:46:38.390 --> 00:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
poov thank you for taking my second
 
00:46:42.109 --> 00:46:42.119 align:start position:0%
question uh follow up on what was just
 
00:46:45.470 --> 00:46:45.480 align:start position:0%
discussed so uh you mention highrisk
 
00:46:49.230 --> 00:46:49.240 align:start position:0%
groups that uh can uh include children
 
00:46:55.150 --> 00:46:55.160 align:start position:0%
uh but um uh if we take um um otherwise
 
00:47:00.589 --> 00:47:00.599 align:start position:0%
healthy kids uh is it possible that uh
 
00:47:04.510 --> 00:47:04.520 align:start position:0%
your office uh uh can review your
 
00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:08.640 align:start position:0%
decision uh from two years ago and
 
00:47:12.589 --> 00:47:12.599 align:start position:0%
review the need of it and previously we
 
00:47:15.549 --> 00:47:15.559 align:start position:0%
discussed with a representative Merchant
 
00:47:18.270 --> 00:47:18.280 align:start position:0%
who recommended this committee to focus
 
00:47:21.589 --> 00:47:21.599 align:start position:0%
on what was known and what decisions New
 
00:47:24.230 --> 00:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh takes based on what was
 
00:47:27.710 --> 00:47:27.720 align:start position:0%
known and uh I see four facts first fact
 
00:47:33.190 --> 00:47:33.200 align:start position:0%
from the early Wuhan data uh we saw that
 
00:47:36.349 --> 00:47:36.359 align:start position:0%
unlike flu and other diseases covid
 
00:47:39.710 --> 00:47:39.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't affect kids as much uh kids are
 
00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:40.870 align:start position:0%
doesn't affect kids as much uh kids are
not

00:47:40.870 --> 00:47:40.880 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:42.630 align:start position:0%
not
typically

00:47:42.630 --> 00:47:42.640 align:start position:0%
typically
 
00:47:46.390 --> 00:47:46.400 align:start position:0%
uh affected population as much as
 
00:47:51.630 --> 00:47:51.640 align:start position:0%
elderly people uh second uh uh if we
 
00:47:54.990 --> 00:47:55.000 align:start position:0%
take New Hampshire data D dashboard uh
 
00:47:58.829 --> 00:47:58.839 align:start position:0%
it shows uh uh minor deaths from covid
 
00:48:03.750 --> 00:48:03.760 align:start position:0%
uh but uh uh according to CDC that
 
00:48:06.990 --> 00:48:07.000 align:start position:0%
included uh multiple severe
 
00:48:11.270 --> 00:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
comorbidities so uh for all those years
 
00:48:14.270 --> 00:48:14.280 align:start position:0%
not a single otherwise healthy kid died
 
00:48:20.510 --> 00:48:20.520 align:start position:0%
of covid according uh to CDC data and um
 
00:48:26.309 --> 00:48:26.319 align:start position:0%
despite uh um early data showing 95 uh
 
00:48:28.750 --> 00:48:28.760 align:start position:0%
efficient in preventing infection now we
 
00:48:31.109 --> 00:48:31.119 align:start position:0%
know that vaccines do not stop
 
00:48:34.589 --> 00:48:34.599 align:start position:0%
transmission so vaccinating healthy kids
 
00:48:38.309 --> 00:48:38.319 align:start position:0%
won protect vulnerable populations from
 
00:48:41.390 --> 00:48:41.400 align:start position:0%
infection and finally previously you
 
00:48:44.430 --> 00:48:44.440 align:start position:0%
testified in state house uh that there
 
00:48:46.990 --> 00:48:47.000 align:start position:0%
are some statistically significant side
 
00:48:50.109 --> 00:48:50.119 align:start position:0%
effects known such as myocarditis and
 
00:48:53.549 --> 00:48:53.559 align:start position:0%
young males from covid vaccine so given
 
00:48:57.470 --> 00:48:57.480 align:start position:0%
those four facts uh I would suggest that
 
00:49:00.430 --> 00:49:00.440 align:start position:0%
there's a time to review
 
00:49:02.990 --> 00:49:03.000 align:start position:0%
recommendation uh for otherwise healthy
 
00:49:08.150 --> 00:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
kids uh I I agree with you that if maybe
 
00:49:12.270 --> 00:49:12.280 align:start position:0%
we should leave availability but but my
 
00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
question about
 
00:49:16.510 --> 00:49:16.520 align:start position:0%
recommendation thank you I'm sorry what
 
00:49:18.390 --> 00:49:18.400 align:start position:0%
what's the can you clarify what the
 
00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:19.710 align:start position:0%
what's the can you clarify what the
question

00:49:19.710 --> 00:49:19.720 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:49:24.470 --> 00:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
is uh are you open in reviewing your
 
00:49:27.549 --> 00:49:27.559 align:start position:0%
recommendation uh to vaccinate otherwise
 
00:49:30.430 --> 00:49:30.440 align:start position:0%
healthy kids so so actually maybe this
 
00:49:33.270 --> 00:49:33.280 align:start position:0%
is an important point we we are not um
 
00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
creating our
 
00:49:40.349 --> 00:49:40.359 align:start position:0%
own guidance around vaccination we
 
00:49:43.829 --> 00:49:43.839 align:start position:0%
are pushing out and
 
00:49:46.430 --> 00:49:46.440 align:start position:0%
messaging the federal science-based
 
00:49:53.750 --> 00:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:56.750 --> 00:49:56.760 align:start position:0%
acip represent P do you have followup
 
00:49:58.710 --> 00:49:58.720 align:start position:0%
I'll also maybe I'm sorry to clarify
 
00:50:00.510 --> 00:50:00.520 align:start position:0%
that people that have concerns or
 
00:50:01.990 --> 00:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
questions about the vaccines need to
 
00:50:03.030 --> 00:50:03.040 align:start position:0%
discuss it with their healthcare
 
00:50:04.549 --> 00:50:04.559 align:start position:0%
provider right so you're absolutely
 
00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
right that there is an association I've
 
00:50:08.870 --> 00:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
said this before um that there's an
 
00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
association between uh covid-19
 
00:50:14.589 --> 00:50:14.599 align:start position:0%
vaccination and myocarditis in
 
00:50:17.990 --> 00:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
particularly young males so um teenage
 
00:50:21.589 --> 00:50:21.599 align:start position:0%
males and and young adults um it took
 
00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
vaccination at a population level for
 
00:50:25.390 --> 00:50:25.400 align:start position:0%
that rare outcome to be identified right
 
00:50:26.270 --> 00:50:26.280 align:start position:0%
that's not something that could be
 
00:50:29.190 --> 00:50:29.200 align:start position:0%
identified in the phase three clinical
 
00:50:30.630 --> 00:50:30.640 align:start position:0%
trials even with you know tens of
 
00:50:32.190 --> 00:50:32.200 align:start position:0%
thousands of people it took vaccinating
 
00:50:34.670 --> 00:50:34.680 align:start position:0%
millions of people uh to identify that
 
00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
that outcome and I point that out
 
00:50:38.470 --> 00:50:38.480 align:start position:0%
because that's a rare and uncommon
 
00:50:40.230 --> 00:50:40.240 align:start position:0%
Association but you're right it's still
 
00:50:42.910 --> 00:50:42.920 align:start position:0%
a real and true um Association that has
 
00:50:44.750 --> 00:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
been found over and over again with use
 
00:50:49.910 --> 00:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
of the the covid-19 vaccines um that is
 
00:50:53.150 --> 00:50:53.160 align:start position:0%
um people that have concerns about that
 
00:50:54.349 --> 00:50:54.359 align:start position:0%
um should discuss that with their
 
00:50:56.270 --> 00:50:56.280 align:start position:0%
healthcare provider for their specific
 
00:50:57.829 --> 00:50:57.839 align:start position:0%
situation ation their specific health
 
00:50:59.750 --> 00:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
status and ultimately at the end of the
 
00:51:02.950 --> 00:51:02.960 align:start position:0%
day if a parent or Guardian um doesn't
 
00:51:04.589 --> 00:51:04.599 align:start position:0%
want to vaccinate their child because
 
00:51:06.030 --> 00:51:06.040 align:start position:0%
they're concerned about the side effects
 
00:51:07.390 --> 00:51:07.400 align:start position:0%
then that's that's certainly their
 
00:51:10.390 --> 00:51:10.400 align:start position:0%
choice there's no requirement out there
 
00:51:13.789 --> 00:51:13.799 align:start position:0%
for for kids to be vaccinated um and the
 
00:51:16.510 --> 00:51:16.520 align:start position:0%
the the federal recommendations the the
 
00:51:18.589 --> 00:51:18.599 align:start position:0%
medical recommendations that are put out
 
00:51:21.230 --> 00:51:21.240 align:start position:0%
by the ACP are what they are after
 
00:51:23.069 --> 00:51:23.079 align:start position:0%
having gone through that scientific
 
00:51:26.789 --> 00:51:26.799 align:start position:0%
review we're not we're not counter ing
 
00:51:29.069 --> 00:51:29.079 align:start position:0%
or contradicting those Federal guidance
 
00:51:31.190 --> 00:51:31.200 align:start position:0%
and we're not we're not putting out our
 
00:51:33.390 --> 00:51:33.400 align:start position:0%
own different
 
00:51:35.990 --> 00:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
recommendations uh because there's a
 
00:51:37.470 --> 00:51:37.480 align:start position:0%
process and there's a medical group that
 
00:51:39.910 --> 00:51:39.920 align:start position:0%
already reviews the science to to make
 
00:51:41.309 --> 00:51:41.319 align:start position:0%
to make that
 
00:51:43.630 --> 00:51:43.640 align:start position:0%
guidance uh representative groer then
 
00:51:47.710 --> 00:51:47.720 align:start position:0%
representative beler thank you um I do
 
00:51:50.789 --> 00:51:50.799 align:start position:0%
want to State though that I believe the
 
00:51:53.789 --> 00:51:53.799 align:start position:0%
mission of this committee is to look at
 
00:51:57.309 --> 00:51:57.319 align:start position:0%
how we handled the efficacy of not what
 
00:51:59.589 --> 00:51:59.599 align:start position:0%
we're doing now I mean it's a completely
 
00:51:59.599 --> 00:52:01.190 align:start position:0%
we're doing now I mean it's a completely
different

00:52:01.190 --> 00:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:52:04.309 --> 00:52:04.319 align:start position:0%
scope um but I do want to I would like
 
00:52:08.510 --> 00:52:08.520 align:start position:0%
you to make a comment on the
 
00:52:11.470 --> 00:52:11.480 align:start position:0%
atmosphere that the state was under the
 
00:52:16.349 --> 00:52:16.359 align:start position:0%
country was under and the I think and
 
00:52:18.829 --> 00:52:18.839 align:start position:0%
confirm right that everybody including
 
00:52:22.349 --> 00:52:22.359 align:start position:0%
residents and and constituents of New
 
00:52:25.549 --> 00:52:25.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the state and the world
 
00:52:27.230 --> 00:52:27.240 align:start position:0%
was trying to do the very best that they
 
00:52:29.829 --> 00:52:29.839 align:start position:0%
can or that they they could with the
 
00:52:32.829 --> 00:52:32.839 align:start position:0%
data that they had at the time that if
 
00:52:35.190 --> 00:52:35.200 align:start position:0%
you could comment a little bit about
 
00:52:40.150 --> 00:52:40.160 align:start position:0%
how um the evolution of a
 
00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:42.829 align:start position:0%
how um the evolution of a
situation

00:52:42.829 --> 00:52:42.839 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:52:46.630 --> 00:52:46.640 align:start position:0%
um tailors your response yeah that thank
 
00:52:47.950 --> 00:52:47.960 align:start position:0%
you for that question because you're
 
00:52:50.230 --> 00:52:50.240 align:start position:0%
absolutely right like what we're in now
 
00:52:54.309 --> 00:52:54.319 align:start position:0%
is a normal steady state in terms of you
 
00:52:56.829 --> 00:52:56.839 align:start position:0%
know reviewing the science doing the
 
00:52:58.630 --> 00:52:58.640 align:start position:0%
data and putting out messaging around
 
00:53:00.829 --> 00:53:00.839 align:start position:0%
sort of routine vaccine recommendations
 
00:53:03.470 --> 00:53:03.480 align:start position:0%
whether that's the covid-19 vaccine or
 
00:53:06.589 --> 00:53:06.599 align:start position:0%
you know pediatric pacle vaccine or the
 
00:53:09.190 --> 00:53:09.200 align:start position:0%
new RSV vaccines right this is sort of
 
00:53:12.150 --> 00:53:12.160 align:start position:0%
normal steady state work this was very
 
00:53:14.270 --> 00:53:14.280 align:start position:0%
different from what was happening um
 
00:53:17.309 --> 00:53:17.319 align:start position:0%
during the during the pandemic where um
 
00:53:20.670 --> 00:53:20.680 align:start position:0%
we were probably reading and reviewing
 
00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
almost every study that came out that's
 
00:53:24.829 --> 00:53:24.839 align:start position:0%
a slight you know exaggeration probably
 
00:53:27.230 --> 00:53:27.240 align:start position:0%
slight hyperbole but literally trying to
 
00:53:29.069 --> 00:53:29.079 align:start position:0%
get our hands on you know every study
 
00:53:32.349 --> 00:53:32.359 align:start position:0%
that came out um on new Therapeutics
 
00:53:34.510 --> 00:53:34.520 align:start position:0%
that were coming out um to the earlier
 
00:53:38.190 --> 00:53:38.200 align:start position:0%
question or vaccines um and messaging
 
00:53:42.870 --> 00:53:42.880 align:start position:0%
that data um in real time to healthc
 
00:53:45.190 --> 00:53:45.200 align:start position:0%
care providers
 
00:53:48.349 --> 00:53:48.359 align:start position:0%
um the you know it it wasn't just
 
00:53:50.349 --> 00:53:50.359 align:start position:0%
putting out recommendations and
 
00:53:53.030 --> 00:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
information when the federal government
 
00:53:55.230 --> 00:53:55.240 align:start position:0%
decided to put out guidance and and
 
00:53:55.240 --> 00:53:56.990 align:start position:0%
decided to put out guidance and and
recommendations

00:53:56.990 --> 00:53:57.000 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
00:54:00.109 --> 00:54:00.119 align:start position:0%
um that was often times delayed and so
 
00:54:03.030 --> 00:54:03.040 align:start position:0%
we were in the situation of in real time
 
00:54:05.950 --> 00:54:05.960 align:start position:0%
reviewing the science reviewing the data
 
00:54:09.069 --> 00:54:09.079 align:start position:0%
um and proactively on a weekly basis you
 
00:54:11.829 --> 00:54:11.839 align:start position:0%
know communicating with for example our
 
00:54:13.270 --> 00:54:13.280 align:start position:0%
Healthcare Providers or Public Health
 
00:54:15.150 --> 00:54:15.160 align:start position:0%
Partners schools long-term care
 
00:54:17.670 --> 00:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
facilities about the the real active
 
00:54:22.470 --> 00:54:22.480 align:start position:0%
data we we had um throughout the first
 
00:54:24.990 --> 00:54:25.000 align:start position:0%
year of the pandemic we not only were
 
00:54:27.990 --> 00:54:28.000 align:start position:0%
having the weekly press conferences we
 
00:54:31.069 --> 00:54:31.079 align:start position:0%
were hosting weekly webinars for healthc
 
00:54:33.309 --> 00:54:33.319 align:start position:0%
care providers along with weekly
 
00:54:36.430 --> 00:54:36.440 align:start position:0%
webinars for schools along with weekly
 
00:54:39.109 --> 00:54:39.119 align:start position:0%
webinars for long-term care facilities
 
00:54:42.430 --> 00:54:42.440 align:start position:0%
so we were constantly sharing um updated
 
00:54:44.390 --> 00:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
science and guidance on a weekly basis
 
00:54:47.670 --> 00:54:47.680 align:start position:0%
for for months um with the these
 
00:54:49.190 --> 00:54:49.200 align:start position:0%
different these various groups in
 
00:54:50.910 --> 00:54:50.920 align:start position:0%
addition to the public messaging that
 
00:54:53.870 --> 00:54:53.880 align:start position:0%
that I think people commonly saw so we
 
00:54:57.390 --> 00:54:57.400 align:start position:0%
were in the this the uh proa acve state
 
00:54:59.109 --> 00:54:59.119 align:start position:0%
of actively reviewing and putting out
 
00:55:02.030 --> 00:55:02.040 align:start position:0%
information and messaging and sometimes
 
00:55:04.190 --> 00:55:04.200 align:start position:0%
this led to us putting out different
 
00:55:05.950 --> 00:55:05.960 align:start position:0%
guidance I'm I'm talking not the
 
00:55:07.870 --> 00:55:07.880 align:start position:0%
vaccines um but you know putting out
 
00:55:10.670 --> 00:55:10.680 align:start position:0%
different guidance uh very early in the
 
00:55:13.829 --> 00:55:13.839 align:start position:0%
pandemic uh the federal government was
 
00:55:18.910 --> 00:55:18.920 align:start position:0%
trying to roll out antigen testing to um
 
00:55:21.309 --> 00:55:21.319 align:start position:0%
long-term care facilities to do more
 
00:55:23.230 --> 00:55:23.240 align:start position:0%
testing so that they could prevent
 
00:55:25.630 --> 00:55:25.640 align:start position:0%
outbreaks at long-term care facilities
 
00:55:28.750 --> 00:55:28.760 align:start position:0%
now anybody that um was looking at the
 
00:55:31.430 --> 00:55:31.440 align:start position:0%
data I shouldn't say anybody we were
 
00:55:33.109 --> 00:55:33.119 align:start position:0%
looking at the data on those on what was
 
00:55:35.390 --> 00:55:35.400 align:start position:0%
coming out with you know the the
 
00:55:38.349 --> 00:55:38.359 align:start position:0%
accuracy of these antigen tests um and
 
00:55:39.789 --> 00:55:39.799 align:start position:0%
thinking through the logistics of
 
00:55:41.470 --> 00:55:41.480 align:start position:0%
implementing antigen testing at
 
00:55:44.309 --> 00:55:44.319 align:start position:0%
long-term care facilities and we were
 
00:55:46.390 --> 00:55:46.400 align:start position:0%
like you know we actually went to the
 
00:55:48.430 --> 00:55:48.440 align:start position:0%
long-term care facilities and said we
 
00:55:49.710 --> 00:55:49.720 align:start position:0%
even though the federal government was
 
00:55:52.910 --> 00:55:52.920 align:start position:0%
saying use these use these antigen tests
 
00:55:55.069 --> 00:55:55.079 align:start position:0%
we were saying don't use these antigen
 
00:55:56.630 --> 00:55:56.640 align:start position:0%
tests for that purpose that's not what
 
00:55:57.990 --> 00:55:58.000 align:start position:0%
they're primarily designed for and they
 
00:55:59.829 --> 00:55:59.839 align:start position:0%
don't have the accuracy that you want
 
00:56:01.230 --> 00:56:01.240 align:start position:0%
we're going to do something different
 
00:56:03.710 --> 00:56:03.720 align:start position:0%
and set up a different better I think
 
00:56:05.710 --> 00:56:05.720 align:start position:0%
you know better process for for rolling
 
00:56:08.829 --> 00:56:08.839 align:start position:0%
out PCR testing uh in long-term care
 
00:56:10.670 --> 00:56:10.680 align:start position:0%
facilities and so we we made that
 
00:56:12.910 --> 00:56:12.920 align:start position:0%
resource available through you know
 
00:56:17.109 --> 00:56:17.119 align:start position:0%
state government um and uh you know in
 
00:56:18.589 --> 00:56:18.599 align:start position:0%
hindsight I think that was the the
 
00:56:20.029 --> 00:56:20.039 align:start position:0%
better the better option so so we
 
00:56:21.870 --> 00:56:21.880 align:start position:0%
weren't just blindly following what the
 
00:56:23.670 --> 00:56:23.680 align:start position:0%
federal government was telling us doing
 
00:56:24.910 --> 00:56:24.920 align:start position:0%
telling us to do and in fact a lot of
 
00:56:26.950 --> 00:56:26.960 align:start position:0%
times the guidance wasn't there
 
00:56:28.750 --> 00:56:28.760 align:start position:0%
um so we were in the setting of having
 
00:56:30.990 --> 00:56:31.000 align:start position:0%
to develop our own
 
00:56:33.270 --> 00:56:33.280 align:start position:0%
guidance but the vaccine guidance that
 
00:56:38.190 --> 00:56:38.200 align:start position:0%
came out um was science-based and so the
 
00:56:40.390 --> 00:56:40.400 align:start position:0%
vaccines first rolled out in December we
 
00:56:41.710 --> 00:56:41.720 align:start position:0%
were reviewing the studies that were
 
00:56:42.990 --> 00:56:43.000 align:start position:0%
coming out we were messaging those
 
00:56:45.309 --> 00:56:45.319 align:start position:0%
studies we were sharing them uh the the
 
00:56:46.670 --> 00:56:46.680 align:start position:0%
information and the data with Healthcare
 
00:56:49.470 --> 00:56:49.480 align:start position:0%
Providers showing you know demonstrating
 
00:56:51.230 --> 00:56:51.240 align:start position:0%
the the safety and the efficacy of of
 
00:56:53.309 --> 00:56:53.319 align:start position:0%
these vaccines and that contributed to
 
00:56:54.910 --> 00:56:54.920 align:start position:0%
the promotion and the roll out of
 
00:56:58.390 --> 00:56:58.400 align:start position:0%
vaccines at a St state and local
 
00:57:01.910 --> 00:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
level follow up you thank you madam
 
00:57:04.230 --> 00:57:04.240 align:start position:0%
chair so and I'm listening to what
 
00:57:08.069 --> 00:57:08.079 align:start position:0%
you're saying and in hindsight one of
 
00:57:12.870 --> 00:57:12.880 align:start position:0%
the um points that I think we might walk
 
00:57:15.270 --> 00:57:15.280 align:start position:0%
away with is
 
00:57:18.829 --> 00:57:18.839 align:start position:0%
that um in a situation where we have a
 
00:57:21.190 --> 00:57:21.200 align:start position:0%
pandemic there's a lot of messaging that
 
00:57:24.510 --> 00:57:24.520 align:start position:0%
goes around correct and
 
00:57:28.710 --> 00:57:28.720 align:start position:0%
so because we seem we have a Department
 
00:57:31.870 --> 00:57:31.880 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services that is
 
00:57:33.270 --> 00:57:33.280 align:start position:0%
that has the
 
00:57:36.150 --> 00:57:36.160 align:start position:0%
expertise and has the ability to analyze
 
00:57:38.549 --> 00:57:38.559 align:start position:0%
all this information that's coming into
 
00:57:42.630 --> 00:57:42.640 align:start position:0%
them how do we although we can't I know
 
00:57:45.029 --> 00:57:45.039 align:start position:0%
we can't limit the information that is
 
00:57:47.789 --> 00:57:47.799 align:start position:0%
being received how is it that we could
 
00:57:50.870 --> 00:57:50.880 align:start position:0%
give priority or at least
 
00:57:54.710 --> 00:57:54.720 align:start position:0%
support the work that DHHS does for New
 
00:57:57.589 --> 00:57:57.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is that something that you
 
00:58:00.150 --> 00:58:00.160 align:start position:0%
could comment on because I think that
 
00:58:02.670 --> 00:58:02.680 align:start position:0%
the work that you were
 
00:58:06.069 --> 00:58:06.079 align:start position:0%
doing may have been lost in everything
 
00:58:07.670 --> 00:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
else that was going on I mean I know
 
00:58:10.230 --> 00:58:10.240 align:start position:0%
from a legislative standpoint we weren't
 
00:58:12.390 --> 00:58:12.400 align:start position:0%
meeting either right we were all over
 
00:58:14.549 --> 00:58:14.559 align:start position:0%
the place in New Hampshire looking for
 
00:58:16.230 --> 00:58:16.240 align:start position:0%
some place to
 
00:58:21.150 --> 00:58:21.160 align:start position:0%
meet um so which I felt I mean for me
 
00:58:23.630 --> 00:58:23.640 align:start position:0%
personally I felt safe doing that
 
00:58:26.549 --> 00:58:26.559 align:start position:0%
way but um you know I think some of the
 
00:58:28.710 --> 00:58:28.720 align:start position:0%
work that you were doing especially in
 
00:58:30.789 --> 00:58:30.799 align:start position:0%
for healthc care facilities and for
 
00:58:34.870 --> 00:58:34.880 align:start position:0%
schools and for um the the data that you
 
00:58:34.880 --> 00:58:35.710 align:start position:0%
schools and for um the the data that you
were

00:58:35.710 --> 00:58:35.720 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:58:39.309 --> 00:58:39.319 align:start position:0%
getting was um is important and I don't
 
00:58:41.230 --> 00:58:41.240 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't not that I want to ever put
 
00:58:43.270 --> 00:58:43.280 align:start position:0%
our state or our country or our world
 
00:58:45.309 --> 00:58:45.319 align:start position:0%
into that situation
 
00:58:52.150 --> 00:58:52.160 align:start position:0%
again but um how do we communicate that
 
00:58:56.109 --> 00:58:56.119 align:start position:0%
better uh communicate the public health
 
00:58:58.910 --> 00:58:58.920 align:start position:0%
work and the yes that use that that New
 
00:59:00.870 --> 00:59:00.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is specifically
 
00:59:03.069 --> 00:59:03.079 align:start position:0%
doing yeah well thank you for that
 
00:59:06.270 --> 00:59:06.280 align:start position:0%
question and I appreciate the um when
 
00:59:08.190 --> 00:59:08.200 align:start position:0%
people ask about how to support public
 
00:59:11.549 --> 00:59:11.559 align:start position:0%
health because um obviously I I maybe
 
00:59:13.309 --> 00:59:13.319 align:start position:0%
biased I think Public Health work is
 
00:59:15.510 --> 00:59:15.520 align:start position:0%
important um you know I think that
 
00:59:17.190 --> 00:59:17.200 align:start position:0%
there's a couple different aspects that
 
00:59:21.670 --> 00:59:21.680 align:start position:0%
you bring up one is um how to facilitate
 
00:59:23.710 --> 00:59:23.720 align:start position:0%
Public Health work how to support Public
 
00:59:26.109 --> 00:59:26.119 align:start position:0%
Health work the other is maybe more
 
00:59:27.910 --> 00:59:27.920 align:start position:0%
around messaging how do we communicate
 
00:59:31.829 --> 00:59:31.839 align:start position:0%
that to to people um so you know I think
 
00:59:33.750 --> 00:59:33.760 align:start position:0%
that the the first question about
 
00:59:35.349 --> 00:59:35.359 align:start position:0%
supporting Public Health work I I think
 
00:59:36.990 --> 00:59:37.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of this goes back to sort of my
 
00:59:38.670 --> 00:59:38.680 align:start position:0%
the initial question you asked and my
 
00:59:40.710 --> 00:59:40.720 align:start position:0%
initial answer around you know
 
00:59:42.789 --> 00:59:42.799 align:start position:0%
supporting the workforce the people
 
00:59:45.589 --> 00:59:45.599 align:start position:0%
right I mean public health is a is a
 
00:59:48.549 --> 00:59:48.559 align:start position:0%
person intensive Personnel resource
 
00:59:52.789 --> 00:59:52.799 align:start position:0%
intensive uh work um and so you know
 
00:59:54.510 --> 00:59:54.520 align:start position:0%
ensuring that we have the people but
 
00:59:56.870 --> 00:59:56.880 align:start position:0%
also the systems uh to do that work
 
00:59:58.470 --> 00:59:58.480 align:start position:0%
right there's there's a lot of people
 
00:59:59.750 --> 00:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
involved and there's a lot of data
 
01:00:02.150 --> 01:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
involved and I think both of these came
 
01:00:03.829 --> 01:00:03.839 align:start position:0%
out during the pandemic of we need more
 
01:00:05.950 --> 01:00:05.960 align:start position:0%
people and we need better Data Systems
 
01:00:07.510 --> 01:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
and so these are these are conversations
 
01:00:10.109 --> 01:00:10.119 align:start position:0%
and issues that are ongoing to this day
 
01:00:11.630 --> 01:00:11.640 align:start position:0%
not just in New Hampshire but at a
 
01:00:13.789 --> 01:00:13.799 align:start position:0%
national level lot lot of discussions
 
01:00:16.789 --> 01:00:16.799 align:start position:0%
nationally about how to um how to
 
01:00:19.349 --> 01:00:19.359 align:start position:0%
improve you know Data Systems and
 
01:00:21.549 --> 01:00:21.559 align:start position:0%
improving the flow of data can improve a
 
01:00:25.230 --> 01:00:25.240 align:start position:0%
response um the the second the second
 
01:00:27.870 --> 01:00:27.880 align:start position:0%
Point uh is around communication and
 
01:00:31.029 --> 01:00:31.039 align:start position:0%
that's that's maybe a more difficult um
 
01:00:34.309 --> 01:00:34.319 align:start position:0%
a more difficult question to answer um
 
01:00:35.630 --> 01:00:35.640 align:start position:0%
because I think everybody's struggling
 
01:00:37.109 --> 01:00:37.119 align:start position:0%
with how do we better communicate with
 
01:00:39.029 --> 01:00:39.039 align:start position:0%
people and I think the several
 
01:00:41.950 --> 01:00:41.960 align:start position:0%
principles of communication that is that
 
01:00:44.510 --> 01:00:44.520 align:start position:0%
you know how we communicate is going to
 
01:00:46.349 --> 01:00:46.359 align:start position:0%
be very dependent
 
01:00:48.670 --> 01:00:48.680 align:start position:0%
on excuse me the
 
01:00:51.750 --> 01:00:51.760 align:start position:0%
audience um and the audience is going to
 
01:00:53.990 --> 01:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
impact the type of message we put out
 
01:00:56.630 --> 01:00:56.640 align:start position:0%
and how we deliver that message
 
01:00:59.630 --> 01:00:59.640 align:start position:0%
right so whether we you know are are
 
01:01:02.710 --> 01:01:02.720 align:start position:0%
communicating with people through the um
 
01:01:05.109 --> 01:01:05.119 align:start position:0%
you know television or print media
 
01:01:07.789 --> 01:01:07.799 align:start position:0%
versus social media right very different
 
01:01:10.029 --> 01:01:10.039 align:start position:0%
audiences are using social media
 
01:01:12.150 --> 01:01:12.160 align:start position:0%
compared to you know print media versus
 
01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:13.069 align:start position:0%
compared to you know print media versus
the

01:01:13.069 --> 01:01:13.079 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:01:16.029 --> 01:01:16.039 align:start position:0%
television um you know I think I don't
 
01:01:18.430 --> 01:01:18.440 align:start position:0%
have a great answer for that question
 
01:01:21.710 --> 01:01:21.720 align:start position:0%
um we constantly struggle with
 
01:01:24.630 --> 01:01:24.640 align:start position:0%
this not just with covid-19 but you know
 
01:01:26.950 --> 01:01:26.960 align:start position:0%
any any dise disease
 
01:01:29.549 --> 01:01:29.559 align:start position:0%
response we can be working at something
 
01:01:31.510 --> 01:01:31.520 align:start position:0%
for months and months and then have
 
01:01:33.069 --> 01:01:33.079 align:start position:0%
people out of the blue come up to us and
 
01:01:34.270 --> 01:01:34.280 align:start position:0%
say hey are you doing anything with
 
01:01:37.150 --> 01:01:37.160 align:start position:0%
ebola right this happened back in 2014
 
01:01:39.069 --> 01:01:39.079 align:start position:0%
we spent months of our time like going
 
01:01:40.870 --> 01:01:40.880 align:start position:0%
around doing presentations talking about
 
01:01:43.150 --> 01:01:43.160 align:start position:0%
the West African Ebola outbreak and we
 
01:01:44.390 --> 01:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
you know sending out message after
 
01:01:46.990 --> 01:01:47.000 align:start position:0%
message to healthc care providers and we
 
01:01:49.150 --> 01:01:49.160 align:start position:0%
we still had healthc care providers
 
01:01:51.029 --> 01:01:51.039 align:start position:0%
months months into the response come up
 
01:01:53.309 --> 01:01:53.319 align:start position:0%
to us and say are are what are you guys
 
01:01:55.950 --> 01:01:55.960 align:start position:0%
doing with ebola like they people just
 
01:01:58.230 --> 01:01:58.240 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily tune in and so it
 
01:02:00.829 --> 01:02:00.839 align:start position:0%
becomes very difficult to make sure that
 
01:02:03.029 --> 01:02:03.039 align:start position:0%
the message is getting consistently to
 
01:02:05.430 --> 01:02:05.440 align:start position:0%
the to the right people and I think it
 
01:02:07.710 --> 01:02:07.720 align:start position:0%
there needs to be better mechanisms and
 
01:02:10.670 --> 01:02:10.680 align:start position:0%
better resources for communicating with
 
01:02:13.150 --> 01:02:13.160 align:start position:0%
different Target audiences you know
 
01:02:14.630 --> 01:02:14.640 align:start position:0%
right now in in the Department of Health
 
01:02:16.549 --> 01:02:16.559 align:start position:0%
and Human Services we have a public
 
01:02:19.750 --> 01:02:19.760 align:start position:0%
information office for example um that
 
01:02:22.309 --> 01:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
has you know a staff for the I for the
 
01:02:24.109 --> 01:02:24.119 align:start position:0%
entire department I don't know the exact
 
01:02:25.630 --> 01:02:25.640 align:start position:0%
number it's like you know four or five
 
01:02:28.109 --> 01:02:28.119 align:start position:0%
people people maybe um so you know
 
01:02:30.349 --> 01:02:30.359 align:start position:0%
communication is is really important
 
01:02:32.109 --> 01:02:32.119 align:start position:0%
because if the information and the
 
01:02:33.910 --> 01:02:33.920 align:start position:0%
messaging isn't getting out there people
 
01:02:36.349 --> 01:02:36.359 align:start position:0%
aren't knowing what's happening what
 
01:02:37.789 --> 01:02:37.799 align:start position:0%
happened during the pandemic with the
 
01:02:39.789 --> 01:02:39.799 align:start position:0%
weekly press conferences was that it was
 
01:02:42.069 --> 01:02:42.079 align:start position:0%
such sort of a high-profile routine
 
01:02:43.910 --> 01:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
recurrence that I think more and more
 
01:02:45.950 --> 01:02:45.960 align:start position:0%
people were able to tune in but uh for
 
01:02:48.269 --> 01:02:48.279 align:start position:0%
some of the the routine work that we do
 
01:02:51.670 --> 01:02:51.680 align:start position:0%
the the you know sporadic outbreak
 
01:02:54.069 --> 01:02:54.079 align:start position:0%
investigations or disease threats we
 
01:02:56.029 --> 01:02:56.039 align:start position:0%
have it it continues to be a challenge
 
01:02:57.349 --> 01:02:57.359 align:start position:0%
to get you know people's attention and
 
01:02:57.359 --> 01:02:59.750 align:start position:0%
to get you know people's attention and
communicate

01:02:59.750 --> 01:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
communicate
 
01:03:03.670 --> 01:03:03.680 align:start position:0%
effectively uh Dr Chan I I really
 
01:03:04.870 --> 01:03:04.880 align:start position:0%
appreciate you being here but I just
 
01:03:06.390 --> 01:03:06.400 align:start position:0%
want to let the committee know that you
 
01:03:08.349 --> 01:03:08.359 align:start position:0%
know we did receive some data that in
 
01:03:09.390 --> 01:03:09.400 align:start position:0%
March of
 
01:03:11.789 --> 01:03:11.799 align:start position:0%
2023 uh New Hampshire had the second
 
01:03:14.349 --> 01:03:14.359 align:start position:0%
lowest cumulative covid-19 death rate of
 
01:03:18.309 --> 01:03:18.319 align:start position:0%
any state um so uh we need to be
 
01:03:20.950 --> 01:03:20.960 align:start position:0%
cognizant of our Public Health uh and
 
01:03:24.150 --> 01:03:24.160 align:start position:0%
our governor for the good things that uh
 
01:03:27.789 --> 01:03:27.799 align:start position:0%
happened during uh the covid pandemic um
 
01:03:29.710 --> 01:03:29.720 align:start position:0%
but I do have a question for you and I'm
 
01:03:31.269 --> 01:03:31.279 align:start position:0%
not sure if this
 
01:03:35.349 --> 01:03:35.359 align:start position:0%
is with regards to mask mandates um I
 
01:03:36.950 --> 01:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
don't know if your department had
 
01:03:39.470 --> 01:03:39.480 align:start position:0%
anything to do with masking and my
 
01:03:43.109 --> 01:03:43.119 align:start position:0%
question is um with the
 
01:03:47.150 --> 01:03:47.160 align:start position:0%
virus um it's only so many
 
01:03:51.390 --> 01:03:51.400 align:start position:0%
microns um so can you explain to me you
 
01:03:52.870 --> 01:03:52.880 align:start position:0%
know when you
 
01:03:58.150 --> 01:03:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:59.829 --> 01:03:59.839 align:start position:0%
I guess it' be my first question yeah uh
 
01:04:01.630 --> 01:04:01.640 align:start position:0%
so so I think there's actually a few
 
01:04:03.269 --> 01:04:03.279 align:start position:0%
questions in there let me collect my
 
01:04:07.150 --> 01:04:07.160 align:start position:0%
thoughts here for a second so um I I
 
01:04:08.829 --> 01:04:08.839 align:start position:0%
think your ultimate question is about
 
01:04:11.430 --> 01:04:11.440 align:start position:0%
how the virus is transmitted right does
 
01:04:13.589 --> 01:04:13.599 align:start position:0%
it stay suspended in the air can spread
 
01:04:16.269 --> 01:04:16.279 align:start position:0%
over longer distances versus it does it
 
01:04:18.829 --> 01:04:18.839 align:start position:0%
spread more what we typically call
 
01:04:21.549 --> 01:04:21.559 align:start position:0%
droplet format which requires close
 
01:04:23.670 --> 01:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
contact with somebody infected or close
 
01:04:26.230 --> 01:04:26.240 align:start position:0%
exposure um and that that has to do not
 
01:04:28.390 --> 01:04:28.400 align:start position:0%
necessarily with the size of the virus
 
01:04:30.190 --> 01:04:30.200 align:start position:0%
because all viruses are very very small
 
01:04:34.230 --> 01:04:34.240 align:start position:0%
but um how long the virus can remain
 
01:04:37.829 --> 01:04:37.839 align:start position:0%
viable suspended in air you know as you
 
01:04:40.670 --> 01:04:40.680 align:start position:0%
have these little aerosolized particles
 
01:04:42.589 --> 01:04:42.599 align:start position:0%
does the virus survive in those over
 
01:04:44.549 --> 01:04:44.559 align:start position:0%
long distances or long periods of time
 
01:04:46.990 --> 01:04:47.000 align:start position:0%
which can facilitate the the spread of
 
01:04:50.510 --> 01:04:50.520 align:start position:0%
it you know through longer distances or
 
01:04:52.309 --> 01:04:52.319 align:start position:0%
does it not survive over longer
 
01:04:54.150 --> 01:04:54.160 align:start position:0%
distances does it require that close
 
01:04:58.190 --> 01:04:58.200 align:start position:0%
that close personal contact to spread
 
01:05:02.589 --> 01:05:02.599 align:start position:0%
um I I think there's a couple so there's
 
01:05:06.269 --> 01:05:06.279 align:start position:0%
been there was a lot of focus over the
 
01:05:09.789 --> 01:05:09.799 align:start position:0%
pandemic about how the virus spread
 
01:05:11.309 --> 01:05:11.319 align:start position:0%
right and it's a respiratory virus so it
 
01:05:12.510 --> 01:05:12.520 align:start position:0%
spreads through the respiratory route
 
01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
the question is just whether it's
 
01:05:17.230 --> 01:05:17.240 align:start position:0%
airborne and spreads long distances or
 
01:05:19.109 --> 01:05:19.119 align:start position:0%
what we call droplet spreads through
 
01:05:22.630 --> 01:05:22.640 align:start position:0%
closer contact like within 3 or six feet
 
01:05:26.269 --> 01:05:26.279 align:start position:0%
um wait we didn't know you know early in
 
01:05:28.390 --> 01:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
the pandemic because we didn't have that
 
01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:30.589 align:start position:0%
the pandemic because we didn't have that
information

01:05:30.589 --> 01:05:30.599 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:05:34.190 --> 01:05:34.200 align:start position:0%
um but some of the as the information
 
01:05:37.190 --> 01:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
this is one of those areas where I think
 
01:05:39.230 --> 01:05:39.240 align:start position:0%
the information changed over the
 
01:05:41.069 --> 01:05:41.079 align:start position:0%
pandemic I think early on in the first
 
01:05:43.430 --> 01:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
weeks and months
 
01:05:47.150 --> 01:05:47.160 align:start position:0%
um the the evidence was pointing to this
 
01:05:49.630 --> 01:05:49.640 align:start position:0%
primarily being spread through close
 
01:05:51.950 --> 01:05:51.960 align:start position:0%
contact so you know within three or six
 
01:05:53.950 --> 01:05:53.960 align:start position:0%
feet of you know being within three or
 
01:05:56.510 --> 01:05:56.520 align:start position:0%
six feet of somebody that was infected
 
01:06:00.589 --> 01:06:00.599 align:start position:0%
um and then over months and even years
 
01:06:03.670 --> 01:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
there was other um as studies
 
01:06:05.549 --> 01:06:05.559 align:start position:0%
accumulated there was other information
 
01:06:07.269 --> 01:06:07.279 align:start position:0%
emerged that suggested that it could be
 
01:06:09.750 --> 01:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
spread longer distances now certainly
 
01:06:11.829 --> 01:06:11.839 align:start position:0%
with any respiratory virus the greatest
 
01:06:14.910 --> 01:06:14.920 align:start position:0%
risk is people you know is people being
 
01:06:16.549 --> 01:06:16.559 align:start position:0%
in closer proximity but I think there
 
01:06:18.390 --> 01:06:18.400 align:start position:0%
was evidence emerging showing that it
 
01:06:20.430 --> 01:06:20.440 align:start position:0%
could be spread over longer
 
01:06:24.870 --> 01:06:24.880 align:start position:0%
distances um and so upfront in a
 
01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:26.309 align:start position:0%
distances um and so upfront in a
response

01:06:26.309 --> 01:06:26.319 align:start position:0%
response
 
01:06:28.589 --> 01:06:28.599 align:start position:0%
there um that that led to when you're
 
01:06:30.190 --> 01:06:30.200 align:start position:0%
talking about mitigation measures that
 
01:06:32.670 --> 01:06:32.680 align:start position:0%
that led to the recommendations around
 
01:06:35.470 --> 01:06:35.480 align:start position:0%
you know avoiding close contact right or
 
01:06:37.029 --> 01:06:37.039 align:start position:0%
being within six feet you know so the
 
01:06:38.309 --> 01:06:38.319 align:start position:0%
physical distancing or the social
 
01:06:40.190 --> 01:06:40.200 align:start position:0%
distancing to prevent somebody being
 
01:06:42.230 --> 01:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
exposed to another person's larger
 
01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:43.390 align:start position:0%
exposed to another person's larger
respiratory

01:06:43.390 --> 01:06:43.400 align:start position:0%
respiratory
 
01:06:46.670 --> 01:06:46.680 align:start position:0%
droplets um that contributed to the
 
01:06:49.190 --> 01:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
masking recommendations initially around
 
01:06:51.269 --> 01:06:51.279 align:start position:0%
cloth face masks and then surgical face
 
01:06:52.789 --> 01:06:52.799 align:start position:0%
masks and then you heard you know talk
 
01:06:54.390 --> 01:06:54.400 align:start position:0%
about you know maybe people want to wear
 
01:06:56.470 --> 01:06:56.480 align:start position:0%
n95 masks when they're out in public
 
01:06:59.789 --> 01:06:59.799 align:start position:0%
which is a whole different debate um you
 
01:07:01.870 --> 01:07:01.880 align:start position:0%
know but the idea being that you know
 
01:07:04.510 --> 01:07:04.520 align:start position:0%
any masking of the face even with cloth
 
01:07:06.750 --> 01:07:06.760 align:start position:0%
masks would prevent those larger
 
01:07:08.470 --> 01:07:08.480 align:start position:0%
droplets from being spread you know
 
01:07:10.510 --> 01:07:10.520 align:start position:0%
personto person and so certainly that
 
01:07:13.589 --> 01:07:13.599 align:start position:0%
factored into some of the initial uh
 
01:07:15.589 --> 01:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
recommendations the mitigation measures
 
01:07:17.349 --> 01:07:17.359 align:start position:0%
around physical distancing and use of
 
01:07:20.029 --> 01:07:20.039 align:start position:0%
face masks was to prevent that closer
 
01:07:24.390 --> 01:07:24.400 align:start position:0%
contact droplet spread um there were
 
01:07:26.990 --> 01:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
always uh the early on there were some
 
01:07:29.190 --> 01:07:29.200 align:start position:0%
case reports
 
01:07:33.470 --> 01:07:33.480 align:start position:0%
of um larger uh transmission events I'm
 
01:07:34.990 --> 01:07:35.000 align:start position:0%
thinking there was a study that came out
 
01:07:37.950 --> 01:07:37.960 align:start position:0%
early on about um a choir that was
 
01:07:41.789 --> 01:07:41.799 align:start position:0%
singing and people got infected like a
 
01:07:43.870 --> 01:07:43.880 align:start position:0%
large majority of the group got infected
 
01:07:45.829 --> 01:07:45.839 align:start position:0%
even though they were not all within six
 
01:07:47.549 --> 01:07:47.559 align:start position:0%
feet of the person that introduced it to
 
01:07:50.069 --> 01:07:50.079 align:start position:0%
that group there were um reports for
 
01:07:51.630 --> 01:07:51.640 align:start position:0%
example at a restaurant of somebody
 
01:07:54.630 --> 01:07:54.640 align:start position:0%
infected and as air was blowing by like
 
01:07:57.029 --> 01:07:57.039 align:start position:0%
a an air conditioner spread the virus
 
01:07:59.269 --> 01:07:59.279 align:start position:0%
you know across a restaurant these were
 
01:08:01.109 --> 01:08:01.119 align:start position:0%
individual sort of case reports coming
 
01:08:02.870 --> 01:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
out and so I think we we realized I
 
01:08:05.710 --> 01:08:05.720 align:start position:0%
think early on that in the right setting
 
01:08:08.829 --> 01:08:08.839 align:start position:0%
or with in the right situation that the
 
01:08:11.269 --> 01:08:11.279 align:start position:0%
virus could be spread longer distances
 
01:08:13.349 --> 01:08:13.359 align:start position:0%
for example there's a fan blowing by
 
01:08:15.669 --> 01:08:15.679 align:start position:0%
somebody or
 
01:08:18.269 --> 01:08:18.279 align:start position:0%
um there are higher risk activities for
 
01:08:19.829 --> 01:08:19.839 align:start position:0%
spreading the virus like if somebody's
 
01:08:21.870 --> 01:08:21.880 align:start position:0%
infected and they're singing you know
 
01:08:23.590 --> 01:08:23.600 align:start position:0%
the the vocal cords are going to you
 
01:08:25.950 --> 01:08:25.960 align:start position:0%
know more likely aerosolize the virus
 
01:08:27.829 --> 01:08:27.839 align:start position:0%
so I think that those kind of things
 
01:08:30.309 --> 01:08:30.319 align:start position:0%
also factored into um guidance that
 
01:08:33.070 --> 01:08:33.080 align:start position:0%
ultimately ended up coming out for
 
01:08:35.430 --> 01:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
specific settings
 
01:08:38.430 --> 01:08:38.440 align:start position:0%
um I I remember when guidance was being
 
01:08:40.829 --> 01:08:40.839 align:start position:0%
developed you know there was separate
 
01:08:44.189 --> 01:08:44.199 align:start position:0%
guidance um for golf courses and
 
01:08:47.590 --> 01:08:47.600 align:start position:0%
equestrian facilities and guidance for
 
01:08:50.030 --> 01:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
restaurants and hotels and you know
 
01:08:53.470 --> 01:08:53.480 align:start position:0%
guidance for school sports and guidance
 
01:08:57.349 --> 01:08:57.359 align:start position:0%
for activities like choir and band
 
01:08:59.870 --> 01:08:59.880 align:start position:0%
practices and so those were the kind of
 
01:09:03.430 --> 01:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
case reports and situations that we um
 
01:09:05.070 --> 01:09:05.080 align:start position:0%
ultimately were trying to factor in like
 
01:09:06.789 --> 01:09:06.799 align:start position:0%
are there higher risk settings where
 
01:09:08.510 --> 01:09:08.520 align:start position:0%
this could spread further than you know
 
01:09:11.550 --> 01:09:11.560 align:start position:0%
three or six feet um but to get to your
 
01:09:13.149 --> 01:09:13.159 align:start position:0%
question and I'm sorry I'm rambling a
 
01:09:15.590 --> 01:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
little bit here uh the to get to your
 
01:09:17.749 --> 01:09:17.759 align:start position:0%
question about a mask mandate you know
 
01:09:17.759 --> 01:09:18.709 align:start position:0%
question about a mask mandate you know
Public

01:09:18.709 --> 01:09:18.719 align:start position:0%
Public
 
01:09:22.749 --> 01:09:22.759 align:start position:0%
Health never in New Hampshire Public
 
01:09:25.829 --> 01:09:25.839 align:start position:0%
Health to my recollection never mandated
 
01:09:29.229 --> 01:09:29.239 align:start position:0%
masks right we helped to create
 
01:09:32.390 --> 01:09:32.400 align:start position:0%
guidance um recommendations for how to
 
01:09:35.149 --> 01:09:35.159 align:start position:0%
slow the spread and that and then that
 
01:09:37.269 --> 01:09:37.279 align:start position:0%
guidance was put out and enforced
 
01:09:40.110 --> 01:09:40.120 align:start position:0%
through other mechanisms right like we
 
01:09:42.630 --> 01:09:42.640 align:start position:0%
don't have the legal authority to say
 
01:09:45.030 --> 01:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
you're required to wear a mask right and
 
01:09:46.510 --> 01:09:46.520 align:start position:0%
so that may have been part of the
 
01:09:47.870 --> 01:09:47.880 align:start position:0%
guidance been been part of the
 
01:09:49.870 --> 01:09:49.880 align:start position:0%
recommendations but the requirement for
 
01:09:52.669 --> 01:09:52.679 align:start position:0%
that was through other larger State
 
01:09:52.679 --> 01:09:55.470 align:start position:0%
that was through other larger State
mechanisms

01:09:55.470 --> 01:09:55.480 align:start position:0%
mechanisms
 
01:09:57.310 --> 01:09:57.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for that information I I
 
01:09:59.430 --> 01:09:59.440 align:start position:0%
appreciate that and you're you're
 
01:10:01.229 --> 01:10:01.239 align:start position:0%
absolutely correct uh that you can't
 
01:10:02.430 --> 01:10:02.440 align:start position:0%
mandate it that was through the
 
01:10:05.950 --> 01:10:05.960 align:start position:0%
government's executive orders um I guess
 
01:10:09.070 --> 01:10:09.080 align:start position:0%
one of the questions I have um because
 
01:10:11.590 --> 01:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
we're talking about public health and
 
01:10:12.790 --> 01:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
the covid
 
01:10:15.950 --> 01:10:15.960 align:start position:0%
pandemic and I
 
01:10:18.910 --> 01:10:18.920 align:start position:0%
guess when it comes to the masking and I
 
01:10:20.310 --> 01:10:20.320 align:start position:0%
understand we were using the Swiss
 
01:10:24.550 --> 01:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
cheese approach um one of the things and
 
01:10:26.350 --> 01:10:26.360 align:start position:0%
I don't know if this was recommended by
 
01:10:28.709 --> 01:10:28.719 align:start position:0%
your department or not is in testimony
 
01:10:31.149 --> 01:10:31.159 align:start position:0%
that we heard is one of the things that
 
01:10:35.189 --> 01:10:35.199 align:start position:0%
I think should have been recommended um
 
01:10:37.430 --> 01:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
by your department is air filtrations in
 
01:10:40.470 --> 01:10:40.480 align:start position:0%
all schools um because I think that
 
01:10:41.790 --> 01:10:41.800 align:start position:0%
would have really been a great
 
01:10:44.510 --> 01:10:44.520 align:start position:0%
mitigation tool um and I'm not sure if
 
01:10:46.910 --> 01:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
that's something uh you discussed or if
 
01:10:49.550 --> 01:10:49.560 align:start position:0%
your department did um just out of
 
01:10:52.070 --> 01:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
curios yeah no that's a great Point um
 
01:10:55.709 --> 01:10:55.719 align:start position:0%
ventilation air filtration um increasing
 
01:10:58.790 --> 01:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
the exchange of indoor air with pressure
 
01:11:03.149 --> 01:11:03.159 align:start position:0%
outdoor air uh that certainly um
 
01:11:07.149 --> 01:11:07.159 align:start position:0%
became uh so let me so
 
01:11:10.189 --> 01:11:10.199 align:start position:0%
um early on there was certainly a
 
01:11:12.590 --> 01:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
recognition and a recommendation around
 
01:11:14.790 --> 01:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
you know open Windows you know and you
 
01:11:16.950 --> 01:11:16.960 align:start position:0%
know outdoor events are safer than
 
01:11:18.590 --> 01:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
indoor events right sort of gets at that
 
01:11:20.709 --> 01:11:20.719 align:start position:0%
same issue of you know being outdoors or
 
01:11:22.830 --> 01:11:22.840 align:start position:0%
having the windows open um increases
 
01:11:25.270 --> 01:11:25.280 align:start position:0%
ventilation increases fresh air in
 
01:11:26.870 --> 01:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
environment so that certainly factored
 
01:11:29.070 --> 01:11:29.080 align:start position:0%
in you know early on I think to your
 
01:11:32.430 --> 01:11:32.440 align:start position:0%
question about you know changing uh uh
 
01:11:34.950 --> 01:11:34.960 align:start position:0%
schools ventilation
 
01:11:40.470 --> 01:11:40.480 align:start position:0%
system um that that is um probably so
 
01:11:44.990 --> 01:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
there was increased focus on that and
 
01:11:47.189 --> 01:11:47.199 align:start position:0%
even money put towards that at a federal
 
01:11:50.590 --> 01:11:50.600 align:start position:0%
level but that became more
 
01:11:53.390 --> 01:11:53.400 align:start position:0%
prominent 2021
 
01:11:56.629 --> 01:11:56.639 align:start position:0%
2022 but but that involved D not so much
 
01:11:59.030 --> 01:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
Public Health as it involved I think
 
01:12:00.590 --> 01:12:00.600 align:start position:0%
figuring out with the Department of
 
01:12:04.790 --> 01:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
Education funding for schools to do this
 
01:12:07.310 --> 01:12:07.320 align:start position:0%
um and then there's guidance that's put
 
01:12:12.750 --> 01:12:12.760 align:start position:0%
out by an organization called ashray as
 
01:12:17.030 --> 01:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
hre um which puts out uh guidance on
 
01:12:19.030 --> 01:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
ventilation systems and
 
01:12:21.590 --> 01:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
buildings um so there was a a technical
 
01:12:23.950 --> 01:12:23.960 align:start position:0%
aspect to this as well that that wasn't
 
01:12:25.510 --> 01:12:25.520 align:start position:0%
so much in public health course as it
 
01:12:27.550 --> 01:12:27.560 align:start position:0%
was in some other organization but I
 
01:12:29.550 --> 01:12:29.560 align:start position:0%
think early on there was certainly
 
01:12:31.070 --> 01:12:31.080 align:start position:0%
recognition that increasing the flow of
 
01:12:34.350 --> 01:12:34.360 align:start position:0%
fresh air was important but funding
 
01:12:37.390 --> 01:12:37.400 align:start position:0%
schools to be able to update their
 
01:12:39.270 --> 01:12:39.280 align:start position:0%
ventilation systems wasn't something
 
01:12:42.070 --> 01:12:42.080 align:start position:0%
that came until later and that was money
 
01:12:44.950 --> 01:12:44.960 align:start position:0%
that flowed I think from the I don't
 
01:12:46.510 --> 01:12:46.520 align:start position:0%
want to speak on something I'm not
 
01:12:48.550 --> 01:12:48.560 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable about but uh I think
 
01:12:50.830 --> 01:12:50.840 align:start position:0%
flowed from the federal government um
 
01:12:52.910 --> 01:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
and probably was directed more by the
 
01:12:55.310 --> 01:12:55.320 align:start position:0%
Department of Education
 
01:12:57.590 --> 01:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
right and I I I guess my question was is
 
01:13:00.870 --> 01:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
not whether um who funded it or whatever
 
01:13:04.390 --> 01:13:04.400 align:start position:0%
okay but um your department recognizing
 
01:13:06.229 --> 01:13:06.239 align:start position:0%
that and maybe talking with the
 
01:13:08.430 --> 01:13:08.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner of education and with the
 
01:13:10.870 --> 01:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
governor and the task force for
 
01:13:13.470 --> 01:13:13.480 align:start position:0%
reopening to uh especially where schools
 
01:13:16.950 --> 01:13:16.960 align:start position:0%
were informed because um
 
01:13:19.750 --> 01:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
even now every time someone goes back to
 
01:13:21.830 --> 01:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
school there's outbreaks of colds flu
 
01:13:23.430 --> 01:13:23.440 align:start position:0%
Etc because you're going back into these
 
01:13:26.910 --> 01:13:26.920 align:start position:0%
closed buildings and Ill filtration from
 
01:13:29.629 --> 01:13:29.639 align:start position:0%
a public health
 
01:13:32.470 --> 01:13:32.480 align:start position:0%
standpoint would help mitigate at least
 
01:13:34.550 --> 01:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
some of that even during the covid time
 
01:13:36.350 --> 01:13:36.360 align:start position:0%
so I don't know if that's a
 
01:13:39.350 --> 01:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
recommendation on your website just in
 
01:13:43.030 --> 01:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
general um that okay it it it is and and
 
01:13:45.590 --> 01:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
it's um that again that became more of a
 
01:13:48.510 --> 01:13:48.520 align:start position:0%
focus and a recommendation later on uh
 
01:13:51.390 --> 01:13:51.400 align:start position:0%
sort of the formal air filtration
 
01:13:51.400 --> 01:13:52.790 align:start position:0%
sort of the formal air filtration
ventilation

01:13:52.790 --> 01:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
ventilation
 
01:13:55.750 --> 01:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
recommendations um and and you're right
 
01:13:55.760 --> 01:13:56.470 align:start position:0%
recommendations um and and you're right
it's

01:13:56.470 --> 01:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:13:58.669 --> 01:13:58.679 align:start position:0%
important I think it was increasingly
 
01:14:00.990 --> 01:14:01.000 align:start position:0%
recognized throughout the pandemic as a
 
01:14:03.110 --> 01:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
need um when we
 
01:14:05.550 --> 01:14:05.560 align:start position:0%
realized the the deficiency of a lot of
 
01:14:07.910 --> 01:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
buildings to have good air filtration
 
01:14:10.590 --> 01:14:10.600 align:start position:0%
air handling units um but it wasn't
 
01:14:13.149 --> 01:14:13.159 align:start position:0%
something that um could be responded to
 
01:14:16.550 --> 01:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
in the immediate moment um for a variety
 
01:14:19.430 --> 01:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
of reasons money you know people to go
 
01:14:22.310 --> 01:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
in and change out ventilation systems in
 
01:14:24.149 --> 01:14:24.159 align:start position:0%
a school or install a new ventilation
 
01:14:25.790 --> 01:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
system but I think the pandemic
 
01:14:27.990 --> 01:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
certainly highlighted that as a need for
 
01:14:30.270 --> 01:14:30.280 align:start position:0%
prevention of any and all respiratory
 
01:14:31.669 --> 01:14:31.679 align:start position:0%
viruses not just
 
01:14:34.709 --> 01:14:34.719 align:start position:0%
covid-19 uh right so because you're a
 
01:14:36.390 --> 01:14:36.400 align:start position:0%
policy department so that's why I was
 
01:14:38.430 --> 01:14:38.440 align:start position:0%
just asking if that's uh one of your
 
01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:39.350 align:start position:0%
just asking if that's uh one of your
policy

01:14:39.350 --> 01:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
policy
 
01:14:41.550 --> 01:14:41.560 align:start position:0%
recommendations um the other question on
 
01:14:43.790 --> 01:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
policy and because you're dealing with
 
01:14:46.350 --> 01:14:46.360 align:start position:0%
public health
 
01:14:50.910 --> 01:14:50.920 align:start position:0%
um I've seen you know I was on some
 
01:14:55.470 --> 01:14:55.480 align:start position:0%
calls during the pandemic um and the
 
01:14:58.990 --> 01:14:59.000 align:start position:0%
masking of children um we're now
 
01:15:01.950 --> 01:15:01.960 align:start position:0%
learning uh has really hindered uh
 
01:15:04.149 --> 01:15:04.159 align:start position:0%
speech development uh there's a need for
 
01:15:07.550 --> 01:15:07.560 align:start position:0%
spee pathologist uh has has really
 
01:15:12.110 --> 01:15:12.120 align:start position:0%
increased um because children not only
 
01:15:14.709 --> 01:15:14.719 align:start position:0%
learn uh By Hearing but they learn by
 
01:15:17.709 --> 01:15:17.719 align:start position:0%
facial expression and everything else um
 
01:15:19.910 --> 01:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
and I've spoken with some teachers who
 
01:15:21.669 --> 01:15:21.679 align:start position:0%
said that even after the fact when the
 
01:15:23.189 --> 01:15:23.199 align:start position:0%
masks were no longer needed these people
 
01:15:24.470 --> 01:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
were afraid to take off their mask
 
01:15:26.189 --> 01:15:26.199 align:start position:0%
because they didn't who their they what
 
01:15:30.030 --> 01:15:30.040 align:start position:0%
their identity was without it um and I'm
 
01:15:33.030 --> 01:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
just wondering from your department when
 
01:15:34.790 --> 01:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
we were talking about mask and you were
 
01:15:36.629 --> 01:15:36.639 align:start position:0%
talking with the other groups and
 
01:15:38.350 --> 01:15:38.360 align:start position:0%
letting them know that this was part of
 
01:15:39.750 --> 01:15:39.760 align:start position:0%
going to be part of our swiss cheese
 
01:15:43.110 --> 01:15:43.120 align:start position:0%
approach if you actually looked at uh
 
01:15:46.390 --> 01:15:46.400 align:start position:0%
from a mental health standpoint um how
 
01:15:49.990 --> 01:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
it was going to affect people especially
 
01:15:51.990 --> 01:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
children yeah that's a that's a great
 
01:15:53.750 --> 01:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
question and thank you for asking that
 
01:15:55.470 --> 01:15:55.480 align:start position:0%
um let me
 
01:15:58.189 --> 01:15:58.199 align:start position:0%
uh the other thing maybe that I should
 
01:16:01.430 --> 01:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
have said up up front uh was
 
01:16:04.750 --> 01:16:04.760 align:start position:0%
that a lot of what we did throughout the
 
01:16:06.709 --> 01:16:06.719 align:start position:0%
pandemic was a balance right we're
 
01:16:09.870 --> 01:16:09.880 align:start position:0%
always trying to find a balance between
 
01:16:13.790 --> 01:16:13.800 align:start position:0%
preventing spread of covid-19 covid-19
 
01:16:17.669 --> 01:16:17.679 align:start position:0%
mitigation and other aspects of Health
 
01:16:20.270 --> 01:16:20.280 align:start position:0%
keeping kids in school I think we all
 
01:16:22.750 --> 01:16:22.760 align:start position:0%
realized early on people that had kids
 
01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:23.910 align:start position:0%
realized early on people that had kids
what

01:16:23.910 --> 01:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:16:27.390 --> 01:16:27.400 align:start position:0%
a not good situation it was to do remote
 
01:16:30.070 --> 01:16:30.080 align:start position:0%
schooling for entire
 
01:16:33.510 --> 01:16:33.520 align:start position:0%
schools um you know but so education
 
01:16:36.550 --> 01:16:36.560 align:start position:0%
Financial Health you know people uh
 
01:16:38.990 --> 01:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
being able to stay Physically Active
 
01:16:41.470 --> 01:16:41.480 align:start position:0%
stay mentally healthy right there was
 
01:16:42.990 --> 01:16:43.000 align:start position:0%
this Balancing Act throughout all the
 
01:16:45.750 --> 01:16:45.760 align:start position:0%
pandemic of trying to balance covid-19
 
01:16:48.110 --> 01:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
prevention mitigation with other aspects
 
01:16:49.790 --> 01:16:49.800 align:start position:0%
of Health which is I think what you're
 
01:16:51.229 --> 01:16:51.239 align:start position:0%
referring to in your
 
01:16:54.990 --> 01:16:55.000 align:start position:0%
question um and so this is part of what
 
01:16:57.189 --> 01:16:57.199 align:start position:0%
required to be changed over the months
 
01:16:59.270 --> 01:16:59.280 align:start position:0%
and years of a pandemic response right
 
01:17:03.070 --> 01:17:03.080 align:start position:0%
early on there was a real fear and um
 
01:17:05.270 --> 01:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
uncertainty around covid-19 that
 
01:17:07.790 --> 01:17:07.800 align:start position:0%
required maybe more of a focus on trying
 
01:17:10.350 --> 01:17:10.360 align:start position:0%
to prevent covid-19 from spreading and
 
01:17:12.110 --> 01:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
the unknown but potentially really
 
01:17:13.669 --> 01:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
severe Health impacts we were hearing
 
01:17:16.110 --> 01:17:16.120 align:start position:0%
about from China from Italy from New
 
01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:17.550 align:start position:0%
about from China from Italy from New
York

01:17:17.550 --> 01:17:17.560 align:start position:0%
York
 
01:17:21.030 --> 01:17:21.040 align:start position:0%
City as we watched covid-19 spread and
 
01:17:24.430 --> 01:17:24.440 align:start position:0%
learned more about it um particularly as
 
01:17:26.110 --> 01:17:26.120 align:start position:0%
you know other resources became
 
01:17:28.070 --> 01:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
available like some of the Therapeutics
 
01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:30.149 align:start position:0%
available like some of the Therapeutics
like

01:17:30.149 --> 01:17:30.159 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:17:33.350 --> 01:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
vaccination that that balance shifted
 
01:17:35.910 --> 01:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
from you know lessening the covid-19
 
01:17:38.910 --> 01:17:38.920 align:start position:0%
mitigation recommendations and trying to
 
01:17:41.790 --> 01:17:41.800 align:start position:0%
ensure that there was more focus on
 
01:17:44.750 --> 01:17:44.760 align:start position:0%
people being able to go to work uh
 
01:17:47.669 --> 01:17:47.679 align:start position:0%
staying active Outdoors you know making
 
01:17:49.830 --> 01:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
sure that their you know impacts on you
 
01:17:52.550 --> 01:17:52.560 align:start position:0%
know mental health um were were trying
 
01:17:56.270 --> 01:17:56.280 align:start position:0%
to be addressed um and so I think the
 
01:17:57.990 --> 01:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
your mask question is a pertinent one
 
01:18:00.669 --> 01:18:00.679 align:start position:0%
because it reflects sort of that shift
 
01:18:03.390 --> 01:18:03.400 align:start position:0%
um I don't think we knew what the impact
 
01:18:06.350 --> 01:18:06.360 align:start position:0%
of you know masking children was was
 
01:18:08.590 --> 01:18:08.600 align:start position:0%
going to be the the focus initially was
 
01:18:10.149 --> 01:18:10.159 align:start position:0%
heavily on preventing the spread of
 
01:18:12.669 --> 01:18:12.679 align:start position:0%
covid-19 but certainly we heard the same
 
01:18:15.870 --> 01:18:15.880 align:start position:0%
reports that you expressed um over the
 
01:18:18.070 --> 01:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
the first weeks and months you know
 
01:18:20.149 --> 01:18:20.159 align:start position:0%
children having difficulty wearing masks
 
01:18:22.510 --> 01:18:22.520 align:start position:0%
you know issues with you know reading
 
01:18:25.229 --> 01:18:25.239 align:start position:0%
faces you know reading lips um emotional
 
01:18:27.790 --> 01:18:27.800 align:start position:0%
Expressions you know speech pathologists
 
01:18:29.229 --> 01:18:29.239 align:start position:0%
and there were some creative things that
 
01:18:33.270 --> 01:18:33.280 align:start position:0%
people um came up with uh you know face
 
01:18:35.830 --> 01:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
Shields instead of face masks for
 
01:18:38.270 --> 01:18:38.280 align:start position:0%
example um but at the end of the day
 
01:18:42.709 --> 01:18:42.719 align:start position:0%
this was one of those um areas where um
 
01:18:44.870 --> 01:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
one there there were always uh
 
01:18:47.430 --> 01:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
recommendations around you know if
 
01:18:50.550 --> 01:18:50.560 align:start position:0%
people you know around um who shouldn't
 
01:18:53.270 --> 01:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
wear a mask you know people that are not
 
01:18:54.870 --> 01:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
recommended to wear a mask like for
 
01:18:56.270 --> 01:18:56.280 align:start position:0%
example very young children it might not
 
01:18:59.189 --> 01:18:59.199 align:start position:0%
be safe um but this is also one of those
 
01:19:02.310 --> 01:19:02.320 align:start position:0%
areas where you know recognizing
 
01:19:06.629 --> 01:19:06.639 align:start position:0%
that the masking of kids for example um
 
01:19:08.590 --> 01:19:08.600 align:start position:0%
had consequences there was a need to
 
01:19:10.870 --> 01:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
sort of try and shift that guidance over
 
01:19:13.790 --> 01:19:13.800 align:start position:0%
time um and I can't remember exactly how
 
01:19:15.709 --> 01:19:15.719 align:start position:0%
that guidance shifted and played out uh
 
01:19:18.270 --> 01:19:18.280 align:start position:0%
we were we were helping to develop and
 
01:19:20.709 --> 01:19:20.719 align:start position:0%
draft guidance on like a weekly basis
 
01:19:24.149 --> 01:19:24.159 align:start position:0%
over years um but I think to your point
 
01:19:26.229 --> 01:19:26.239 align:start position:0%
there was a recognition that you know
 
01:19:28.830 --> 01:19:28.840 align:start position:0%
covid-19 mitigation measures can have
 
01:19:31.149 --> 01:19:31.159 align:start position:0%
negative impacts I think we recognized
 
01:19:33.950 --> 01:19:33.960 align:start position:0%
that early on um but it was always it
 
01:19:35.590 --> 01:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
was always this Balancing Act between
 
01:19:37.229 --> 01:19:37.239 align:start position:0%
trying to protect People's Health from
 
01:19:39.470 --> 01:19:39.480 align:start position:0%
covid-19 and protect and promote
 
01:19:41.350 --> 01:19:41.360 align:start position:0%
People's Health by being able
 
01:19:45.390 --> 01:19:45.400 align:start position:0%
to engage in work and school and you
 
01:19:47.110 --> 01:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
know physical activity
 
01:19:50.189 --> 01:19:50.199 align:start position:0%
Etc I I appreciate that I I can't
 
01:19:52.910 --> 01:19:52.920 align:start position:0%
imagine having to do that Balancing Act
 
01:19:55.270 --> 01:19:55.280 align:start position:0%
um so thank you for that
 
01:19:55.280 --> 01:19:56.910 align:start position:0%
um so thank you for that
representative

01:19:56.910 --> 01:19:56.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:19:59.189 --> 01:19:59.199 align:start position:0%
Belcher thank you madam chair and thank
 
01:20:02.510 --> 01:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
you again um so my my picture of this
 
01:20:04.229 --> 01:20:04.239 align:start position:0%
whole thing right now this whole
 
01:20:05.830 --> 01:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
situation is kind of like a puzzle where
 
01:20:07.430 --> 01:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
I'm missing pieces over here and a
 
01:20:09.550 --> 01:20:09.560 align:start position:0%
little bit over here so I might if it's
 
01:20:11.629 --> 01:20:11.639 align:start position:0%
okay and I'll ask for approval but to
 
01:20:13.590 --> 01:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
jump around a little bit to try to fill
 
01:20:17.070 --> 01:20:17.080 align:start position:0%
in my my total picture a little bit here
 
01:20:20.590 --> 01:20:20.600 align:start position:0%
um so first and and you alluded to this
 
01:20:22.950 --> 01:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
a little bit um when we talked about
 
01:20:26.110 --> 01:20:26.120 align:start position:0%
vaccinations but uh as far as process
 
01:20:29.350 --> 01:20:29.360 align:start position:0%
goes does the DHHS receive guidance or
 
01:20:31.550 --> 01:20:31.560 align:start position:0%
orders from any federal agencies that
 
01:20:34.510 --> 01:20:34.520 align:start position:0%
then become State policy messaging or
 
01:20:37.870 --> 01:20:37.880 align:start position:0%
guidance and if so can you explain that
 
01:20:40.350 --> 01:20:40.360 align:start position:0%
process and what if any direct input the
 
01:20:43.830 --> 01:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
governor or executive Council has on
 
01:20:48.149 --> 01:20:48.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:50.830 --> 01:20:50.840 align:start position:0%
level um I'm thinking nothing jumps
 
01:20:56.189 --> 01:20:56.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:57.709 --> 01:20:57.719 align:start position:0%
there I'm sure there may be an example
 
01:21:01.990 --> 01:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
out there well let me um so this isn't
 
01:21:04.830 --> 01:21:04.840 align:start position:0%
necessarily state government um one of
 
01:21:05.990 --> 01:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
the things we were dealing with during
 
01:21:09.070 --> 01:21:09.080 align:start position:0%
the covid-19 pandemic um Medicare
 
01:21:12.149 --> 01:21:12.159 align:start position:0%
Medicaid came out with requirements
 
01:21:16.189 --> 01:21:16.199 align:start position:0%
of uh what's the term something uh
 
01:21:17.669 --> 01:21:17.679 align:start position:0%
requirements for participation in
 
01:21:20.430 --> 01:21:20.440 align:start position:0%
Medicare Medicaid right and so not not
 
01:21:23.550 --> 01:21:23.560 align:start position:0%
the federal government but hospitals
 
01:21:25.990 --> 01:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
that participated in Medicare were
 
01:21:27.430 --> 01:21:27.440 align:start position:0%
required to
 
01:21:30.229 --> 01:21:30.239 align:start position:0%
follow th that Federal guidance through
 
01:21:32.229 --> 01:21:32.239 align:start position:0%
Medicare Medicaid as a requirement of
 
01:21:33.870 --> 01:21:33.880 align:start position:0%
participation in Medicare that that's
 
01:21:35.870 --> 01:21:35.880 align:start position:0%
one example but you know the the the
 
01:21:38.510 --> 01:21:38.520 align:start position:0%
state has no control or no say in in in
 
01:21:40.669 --> 01:21:40.679 align:start position:0%
any of that that's a a federal policy
 
01:21:43.470 --> 01:21:43.480 align:start position:0%
through you know Medicare
 
01:21:45.629 --> 01:21:45.639 align:start position:0%
Medicaid I just want to remind everyone
 
01:21:48.750 --> 01:21:48.760 align:start position:0%
that the County nursing homes uh had to
 
01:21:53.629 --> 01:21:53.639 align:start position:0%
deal with that a lot um and uh we were
 
01:21:57.350 --> 01:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
very privy to what even H even having
 
01:21:59.110 --> 01:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
subcontractors or contractors coming
 
01:22:00.550 --> 01:22:00.560 align:start position:0%
into the facility what they were
 
01:22:03.709 --> 01:22:03.719 align:start position:0%
required uh before they could even enter
 
01:22:05.390 --> 01:22:05.400 align:start position:0%
uh if they were accepting those Medicare
 
01:22:06.790 --> 01:22:06.800 align:start position:0%
Medicaid dollars so thank you for
 
01:22:07.870 --> 01:22:07.880 align:start position:0%
bringing that out and that came up
 
01:22:09.590 --> 01:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
around visitation in long-term care
 
01:22:11.270 --> 01:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
facilities to to the point about mental
 
01:22:14.629 --> 01:22:14.639 align:start position:0%
health a lot of um older adults were
 
01:22:16.189 --> 01:22:16.199 align:start position:0%
suffering from isolation in long-term
 
01:22:19.350 --> 01:22:19.360 align:start position:0%
care facilities um but we were somewhat
 
01:22:23.270 --> 01:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
constrained by you know CMS guidance
 
01:22:26.229 --> 01:22:26.239 align:start position:0%
requirements um that was controlling
 
01:22:30.229 --> 01:22:30.239 align:start position:0%
some of some of this so if I may I I I
 
01:22:33.270 --> 01:22:33.280 align:start position:0%
think I failed the the phrase my
 
01:22:34.709 --> 01:22:34.719 align:start position:0%
question in the way that I had intended
 
01:22:38.830 --> 01:22:38.840 align:start position:0%
it um I I what I'm getting at is are
 
01:22:41.149 --> 01:22:41.159 align:start position:0%
there any sort of guidance or
 
01:22:43.629 --> 01:22:43.639 align:start position:0%
regulations promulgated at the federal
 
01:22:46.430 --> 01:22:46.440 align:start position:0%
level by by any individual or agency or
 
01:22:48.629 --> 01:22:48.639 align:start position:0%
for that matter any any other level
 
01:22:51.270 --> 01:22:51.280 align:start position:0%
including supernational for that matter
 
01:22:56.430 --> 01:22:56.440 align:start position:0%
that then um is picked up by uh the New
 
01:22:57.750 --> 01:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Health and Human
 
01:23:01.870 --> 01:23:01.880 align:start position:0%
Services to become guidance or anything
 
01:23:03.950 --> 01:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
of that nature and you mentioned for
 
01:23:05.669 --> 01:23:05.679 align:start position:0%
instance vaccination stuff was not
 
01:23:07.950 --> 01:23:07.960 align:start position:0%
developed by New Hampshire DHHS that was
 
01:23:10.149 --> 01:23:10.159 align:start position:0%
developed by a combination of private
 
01:23:12.350 --> 01:23:12.360 align:start position:0%
sector and federal actors who was then
 
01:23:14.229 --> 01:23:14.239 align:start position:0%
so that that answers it for that but as
 
01:23:16.830 --> 01:23:16.840 align:start position:0%
far is there any other sort of stuff
 
01:23:18.550 --> 01:23:18.560 align:start position:0%
that happens nothing nothing that comes
 
01:23:20.430 --> 01:23:20.440 align:start position:0%
to mind nothing from like a legal or or
 
01:23:23.629 --> 01:23:23.639 align:start position:0%
regulatory standpoint um that New
 
01:23:27.910 --> 01:23:27.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is required to adopt I I mean
 
01:23:29.590 --> 01:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
what what happens though is that what
 
01:23:31.790 --> 01:23:31.800 align:start position:0%
happens at a federal level directly
 
01:23:33.830 --> 01:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
impact like with Therapeutics like
 
01:23:35.950 --> 01:23:35.960 align:start position:0%
vaccines or medications or
 
01:23:39.270 --> 01:23:39.280 align:start position:0%
antivirals um what they're approved and
 
01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:40.430 align:start position:0%
antivirals um what they're approved and
recommended

01:23:40.430 --> 01:23:40.440 align:start position:0%
recommended
 
01:23:43.310 --> 01:23:43.320 align:start position:0%
for I mean Healthcare Providers are
 
01:23:46.669 --> 01:23:46.679 align:start position:0%
required not not by any state law or or
 
01:23:49.229 --> 01:23:49.239 align:start position:0%
regulation necessarily to my knowledge
 
01:23:51.110 --> 01:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
or at least Public Health regulation but
 
01:23:52.910 --> 01:23:52.920 align:start position:0%
you know like at a federal level they're
 
01:23:54.430 --> 01:23:54.440 align:start position:0%
approved for a certain indication and
 
01:23:56.750 --> 01:23:56.760 align:start position:0%
providers need to follow you know
 
01:23:59.310 --> 01:23:59.320 align:start position:0%
generally speaking use of those
 
01:24:01.110 --> 01:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
medications under sort of the federal
 
01:24:02.790 --> 01:24:02.800 align:start position:0%
guidance and regulation now there are
 
01:24:05.070 --> 01:24:05.080 align:start position:0%
exceptions to that it's not like a black
 
01:24:06.830 --> 01:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
and white issue because there's like off
 
01:24:08.950 --> 01:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
Lael use of medications that that
 
01:24:10.510 --> 01:24:10.520 align:start position:0%
sometimes happens but again that that
 
01:24:13.110 --> 01:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
gets down to you know discretion at a
 
01:24:15.149 --> 01:24:15.159 align:start position:0%
healthcare provider level for how to use
 
01:24:18.550 --> 01:24:18.560 align:start position:0%
the resources available but nothing that
 
01:24:20.950 --> 01:24:20.960 align:start position:0%
comes to mind that is like a requirement
 
01:24:24.030 --> 01:24:24.040 align:start position:0%
put out or adopted by the state at least
 
01:24:26.229 --> 01:24:26.239 align:start position:0%
from Public Health perspective okay
 
01:24:29.910 --> 01:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
excellent thank you and if I may another
 
01:24:32.750 --> 01:24:32.760 align:start position:0%
little bit of a different topic so as as
 
01:24:34.870 --> 01:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
has been you know stated several times
 
01:24:36.750 --> 01:24:36.760 align:start position:0%
it's very important that we look at not
 
01:24:38.550 --> 01:24:38.560 align:start position:0%
just what we know now I mean in theory
 
01:24:42.070 --> 01:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
hindsights 2020 but what we knew when we
 
01:24:46.790 --> 01:24:46.800 align:start position:0%
knew it um So based on that we've
 
01:24:48.470 --> 01:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
received a lot of testimony as a
 
01:24:50.830 --> 01:24:50.840 align:start position:0%
committee from a lot of various sources
 
01:24:53.750 --> 01:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
we've received a lot of documentation so
 
01:24:55.189 --> 01:24:55.199 align:start position:0%
I have just just a couple questions
 
01:24:58.149 --> 01:24:58.159 align:start position:0%
about whether or not the DHHS is aware
 
01:25:02.550 --> 01:25:02.560 align:start position:0%
and I'll start here um is the DHHS New
 
01:25:03.750 --> 01:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire New Hampshire Department of
 
01:25:07.030 --> 01:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services aware um
 
01:25:09.149 --> 01:25:09.159 align:start position:0%
regarding the controlled studies that
 
01:25:11.109 --> 01:25:11.119 align:start position:0%
were done on the
 
01:25:14.750 --> 01:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
vaccines that the control group in those
 
01:25:18.109 --> 01:25:18.119 align:start position:0%
studies was vaccinated early over the
 
01:25:21.030 --> 01:25:21.040 align:start position:0%
objections of the federal
 
01:25:23.229 --> 01:25:23.239 align:start position:0%
FDA I I am not sure what you're
 
01:25:26.390 --> 01:25:26.400 align:start position:0%
referring to we we reviewed the um
 
01:25:28.310 --> 01:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
studies that came out and so I'm not
 
01:25:31.109 --> 01:25:31.119 align:start position:0%
sure the what you're referencing where
 
01:25:33.109 --> 01:25:33.119 align:start position:0%
where that information is the these were
 
01:25:35.590 --> 01:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
the control trials um for I believe
 
01:25:38.870 --> 01:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
fizer and madna um regarding their
 
01:25:41.430 --> 01:25:41.440 align:start position:0%
vaccines that were released and this is
 
01:25:44.830 --> 01:25:44.840 align:start position:0%
from uh testimony and documentation
 
01:25:47.709 --> 01:25:47.719 align:start position:0%
received by attorney Aaron Siri uh this
 
01:25:50.030 --> 01:25:50.040 align:start position:0%
is cooperated by um I believe it was
 
01:25:53.350 --> 01:25:53.360 align:start position:0%
emails that this committee has um in our
 
01:25:55.990 --> 01:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
possession um uh as far as there was a
 
01:26:00.310 --> 01:26:00.320 align:start position:0%
request from the FDA that they not
 
01:26:02.590 --> 01:26:02.600 align:start position:0%
vaccinate the control group in these
 
01:26:04.870 --> 01:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
studies at a certain point in time and
 
01:26:06.790 --> 01:26:06.800 align:start position:0%
despite that request they were
 
01:26:09.109 --> 01:26:09.119 align:start position:0%
nonetheless immediately vaccinated right
 
01:26:09.119 --> 01:26:10.270 align:start position:0%
nonetheless immediately vaccinated right
after

01:26:10.270 --> 01:26:10.280 align:start position:0%
after
 
01:26:13.910 --> 01:26:13.920 align:start position:0%
that oh I I think so
 
01:26:16.830 --> 01:26:16.840 align:start position:0%
um I think what you're referring to is
 
01:26:16.840 --> 01:26:17.790 align:start position:0%
um I think what you're referring to is
the

01:26:17.790 --> 01:26:17.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:26:21.070 --> 01:26:21.080 align:start position:0%
unblinding of the the different control
 
01:26:23.830 --> 01:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
groups so right so so these clinical so
 
01:26:27.950 --> 01:26:27.960 align:start position:0%
um I I I remember that being in the
 
01:26:29.470 --> 01:26:29.480 align:start position:0%
media at some point I can't remember
 
01:26:34.229 --> 01:26:34.239 align:start position:0%
when um so there are strict
 
01:26:37.510 --> 01:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
processes that and again I don't I don't
 
01:26:38.430 --> 01:26:38.440 align:start position:0%
uh I'm
 
01:26:41.070 --> 01:26:41.080 align:start position:0%
not I'm not involved in these clinical
 
01:26:42.669 --> 01:26:42.679 align:start position:0%
trials at all I'm just speaking for my
 
01:26:44.229 --> 01:26:44.239 align:start position:0%
own knowledge about how clinical trials
 
01:26:46.550 --> 01:26:46.560 align:start position:0%
are conducted um you know clinical
 
01:26:49.310 --> 01:26:49.320 align:start position:0%
trials are conducted in in a specific
 
01:26:51.310 --> 01:26:51.320 align:start position:0%
way and a specific process and monitored
 
01:26:54.590 --> 01:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
by ethics boards and you know IRB these
 
01:26:56.270 --> 01:26:56.280 align:start position:0%
internal review boards that you know
 
01:26:57.990 --> 01:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
monitors to make sure that clinical
 
01:27:01.229 --> 01:27:01.239 align:start position:0%
trials are being conducted in a ethical
 
01:27:04.709 --> 01:27:04.719 align:start position:0%
fashion um and so what happens with um
 
01:27:08.590 --> 01:27:08.600 align:start position:0%
these phase three clinical trials is you
 
01:27:10.709 --> 01:27:10.719 align:start position:0%
know this this is in the terminology you
 
01:27:13.669 --> 01:27:13.679 align:start position:0%
know double blinded Placebo control
 
01:27:15.870 --> 01:27:15.880 align:start position:0%
clinical trials to prevent biases from
 
01:27:17.750 --> 01:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
being introduced into a study you have
 
01:27:19.350 --> 01:27:19.360 align:start position:0%
two different groups and and people
 
01:27:21.109 --> 01:27:21.119 align:start position:0%
don't know whether they're getting the
 
01:27:24.189 --> 01:27:24.199 align:start position:0%
control or the placebo and or versus the
 
01:27:26.870 --> 01:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
you know investigational vaccine um and
 
01:27:27.990 --> 01:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
that's there's a variety of reasons
 
01:27:29.910 --> 01:27:29.920 align:start position:0%
behind that to helps you know increase
 
01:27:32.270 --> 01:27:32.280 align:start position:0%
the validity and the scientific accuracy
 
01:27:34.790 --> 01:27:34.800 align:start position:0%
of the results um but what happens is
 
01:27:36.109 --> 01:27:36.119 align:start position:0%
that you know there's a group that
 
01:27:38.430 --> 01:27:38.440 align:start position:0%
routinely monitors the results and at
 
01:27:40.709 --> 01:27:40.719 align:start position:0%
some point if the vaccine is being found
 
01:27:42.510 --> 01:27:42.520 align:start position:0%
in their study population to be safe and
 
01:27:45.550 --> 01:27:45.560 align:start position:0%
highly effective there's there can be an
 
01:27:48.830 --> 01:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
unblinding um so people can figure out
 
01:27:50.149 --> 01:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
which group they're in and the people
 
01:27:52.510 --> 01:27:52.520 align:start position:0%
that got the placebo or the fake you
 
01:27:54.750 --> 01:27:54.760 align:start position:0%
know saline injection for example can
 
01:27:56.870 --> 01:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
then be offered the real vaccine and I
 
01:27:59.550 --> 01:27:59.560 align:start position:0%
think that's what you're referring to um
 
01:28:01.189 --> 01:28:01.199 align:start position:0%
and I don't I'm wasn't involved in any
 
01:28:02.669 --> 01:28:02.679 align:start position:0%
of those you know Federal discussions
 
01:28:05.149 --> 01:28:05.159 align:start position:0%
this is all this is all managed through
 
01:28:08.030 --> 01:28:08.040 align:start position:0%
um this is all managed through you know
 
01:28:10.950 --> 01:28:10.960 align:start position:0%
ethics and advisory boards and whatnot
 
01:28:13.870 --> 01:28:13.880 align:start position:0%
um but when the vaccine had been shown
 
01:28:16.350 --> 01:28:16.360 align:start position:0%
to I I presume to be 95% effective there
 
01:28:18.950 --> 01:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
was probably an an unblinding it's my
 
01:28:21.390 --> 01:28:21.400 align:start position:0%
guess uh and the vaccine was then
 
01:28:23.070 --> 01:28:23.080 align:start position:0%
offered to the control group so that
 
01:28:24.470 --> 01:28:24.480 align:start position:0%
they could then be protected ected in
 
01:28:26.189 --> 01:28:26.199 align:start position:0%
the midst of the pandemic I do remember
 
01:28:29.510 --> 01:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
that that was an issue that came up um
 
01:28:32.109 --> 01:28:32.119 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure what uh what you're
 
01:28:34.229 --> 01:28:34.239 align:start position:0%
were referencing about the FDA
 
01:28:36.229 --> 01:28:36.239 align:start position:0%
recommending that that not happen I
 
01:28:38.830 --> 01:28:38.840 align:start position:0%
vaguely remember some I I'm I can't
 
01:28:40.270 --> 01:28:40.280 align:start position:0%
comment on that because I I'm not
 
01:28:41.870 --> 01:28:41.880 align:start position:0%
familiar enough with what was said or
 
01:28:44.510 --> 01:28:44.520 align:start position:0%
the context that that was said in but
 
01:28:45.750 --> 01:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
just putting out there that there's a
 
01:28:48.350 --> 01:28:48.360 align:start position:0%
whole like process an ethical review to
 
01:28:49.550 --> 01:28:49.560 align:start position:0%
make sure that these studies are
 
01:28:52.510 --> 01:28:52.520 align:start position:0%
conducted in a safe and ethical manner
 
01:28:55.030 --> 01:28:55.040 align:start position:0%
excellent thank you and may I
 
01:28:58.590 --> 01:28:58.600 align:start position:0%
represent po off uh thank you uh follow
 
01:29:00.790 --> 01:29:00.800 align:start position:0%
up a question on your Authority in
 
01:29:03.790 --> 01:29:03.800 align:start position:0%
regards to acip
 
01:29:07.070 --> 01:29:07.080 align:start position:0%
recommendations uh so uh if I understood
 
01:29:10.270 --> 01:29:10.280 align:start position:0%
uh you agree with guidance to uh
 
01:29:12.709 --> 01:29:12.719 align:start position:0%
vaccinate otherwise healthy kids and
 
01:29:14.629 --> 01:29:14.639 align:start position:0%
your assessment is that it's
 
01:29:17.070 --> 01:29:17.080 align:start position:0%
science-based but generally like some
 
01:29:19.030 --> 01:29:19.040 align:start position:0%
countries do not recommend covid
 
01:29:21.990 --> 01:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
vaccines for otherwise healthy kids and
 
01:29:25.030 --> 01:29:25.040 align:start position:0%
nationally uh since Jan
 
01:29:28.709 --> 01:29:28.719 align:start position:0%
24 Florida called for hold in the use of
 
01:29:32.430 --> 01:29:32.440 align:start position:0%
covid-19 mRNA vaccines and Florida does
 
01:29:36.870 --> 01:29:36.880 align:start position:0%
not recommend boosters for 24 25 yeah
 
01:29:41.270 --> 01:29:41.280 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah uh so um do you have authority
 
01:29:44.950 --> 01:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
to override acip recommendation if you
 
01:29:49.030 --> 01:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
ever see that it's con what science
 
01:29:49.040 --> 01:29:50.950 align:start position:0%
ever see that it's con what science
shows

01:29:50.950 --> 01:29:50.960 align:start position:0%
shows
 
01:29:53.350 --> 01:29:53.360 align:start position:0%
us I I'm not sure what you mean by
 
01:29:55.950 --> 01:29:55.960 align:start position:0%
override acip recommendations I mean
 
01:29:58.270 --> 01:29:58.280 align:start position:0%
those are the National medical
 
01:30:00.790 --> 01:30:00.800 align:start position:0%
guidelines we have
 
01:30:03.830 --> 01:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
control general surgeon have authority
 
01:30:07.470 --> 01:30:07.480 align:start position:0%
to not recommend uh covid-19
 
01:30:10.510 --> 01:30:10.520 align:start position:0%
vaccines do I understand correctly that
 
01:30:12.709 --> 01:30:12.719 align:start position:0%
you you have the same Authority if you
 
01:30:16.189 --> 01:30:16.199 align:start position:0%
ever see that it's counterproductive we
 
01:30:18.030 --> 01:30:18.040 align:start position:0%
could put out whatever recommendation we
 
01:30:21.470 --> 01:30:21.480 align:start position:0%
wanted um but our recommendations would
 
01:30:23.149 --> 01:30:23.159 align:start position:0%
need to be based on the science and the
 
01:30:25.750 --> 01:30:25.760 align:start position:0%
evidence which we've already discussed
 
01:30:29.709 --> 01:30:29.719 align:start position:0%
um and you know have and uh I would
 
01:30:32.030 --> 01:30:32.040 align:start position:0%
suggest that what Florida put out is is
 
01:30:34.990 --> 01:30:35.000 align:start position:0%
not science or evidence-based you know
 
01:30:37.550 --> 01:30:37.560 align:start position:0%
guidance and and representative PS off
 
01:30:39.790 --> 01:30:39.800 align:start position:0%
just um just want to make sure that you
 
01:30:41.390 --> 01:30:41.400 align:start position:0%
know because we're doing we're looking
 
01:30:43.910 --> 01:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
at what happened during covid and I
 
01:30:46.149 --> 01:30:46.159 align:start position:0%
understand we want to see what's
 
01:30:49.390 --> 01:30:49.400 align:start position:0%
happening now versus what happening then
 
01:30:54.189 --> 01:30:54.199 align:start position:0%
but um we need to uh look at that we
 
01:30:54.199 --> 01:30:55.030 align:start position:0%
but um we need to uh look at that we
still

01:30:55.030 --> 01:30:55.040 align:start position:0%
still
 
01:30:59.470 --> 01:30:59.480 align:start position:0%
have I understand thank you represent
 
01:30:59.480 --> 01:31:00.750 align:start position:0%
have I understand thank you represent
weary

01:31:00.750 --> 01:31:00.760 align:start position:0%
weary
 
01:31:03.669 --> 01:31:03.679 align:start position:0%
sorry uh thank you mam chair and uh
 
01:31:05.510 --> 01:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Dr Chan for taking this
 
01:31:07.189 --> 01:31:07.199 align:start position:0%
question um
 
01:31:10.189 --> 01:31:10.199 align:start position:0%
so I have
 
01:31:13.550 --> 01:31:13.560 align:start position:0%
um a scenario early on in your test mode
 
01:31:16.310 --> 01:31:16.320 align:start position:0%
you mentioned testing and we know that
 
01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:17.189 align:start position:0%
you mentioned testing and we know that
the

01:31:17.189 --> 01:31:17.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:31:20.390 --> 01:31:20.400 align:start position:0%
CDC in its initial tests that were
 
01:31:23.590 --> 01:31:23.600 align:start position:0%
released uh later reported um that there
 
01:31:24.669 --> 01:31:24.679 align:start position:0%
was a
 
01:31:27.990 --> 01:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
30% uh failure rate of those uh in terms
 
01:31:29.149 --> 01:31:29.159 align:start position:0%
of false
 
01:31:29.159 --> 01:31:30.870 align:start position:0%
of false
positives

01:31:30.870 --> 01:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
positives
 
01:31:33.910 --> 01:31:33.920 align:start position:0%
and were you and this was you know
 
01:31:35.790 --> 01:31:35.800 align:start position:0%
widely reported
 
01:31:41.270 --> 01:31:41.280 align:start position:0%
in I believe 2022 or was when the HHS
 
01:31:45.390 --> 01:31:45.400 align:start position:0%
report came out and and
 
01:31:48.950 --> 01:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
so did when did New Hampshire become
 
01:31:52.550 --> 01:31:52.560 align:start position:0%
aware of this kind of problem and how
 
01:31:54.390 --> 01:31:54.400 align:start position:0%
how did that affect
 
01:31:56.270 --> 01:31:56.280 align:start position:0%
you know your decision-making process
 
01:31:59.189 --> 01:31:59.199 align:start position:0%
once you became aware of that uh kind of
 
01:32:02.030 --> 01:32:02.040 align:start position:0%
issue with the covid test wait can you
 
01:32:03.830 --> 01:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
clarify your question representative the
 
01:32:05.590 --> 01:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
co testing is this are you referring to
 
01:32:07.830 --> 01:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
the antigen tests you're referring to
 
01:32:10.950 --> 01:32:10.960 align:start position:0%
the PCR based
 
01:32:15.590 --> 01:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
tests the um I so I
 
01:32:18.470 --> 01:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
believe so what which one was the
 
01:32:21.070 --> 01:32:21.080 align:start position:0%
initial test
 
01:32:25.470 --> 01:32:25.480 align:start position:0%
was was it well so so there
 
01:32:28.070 --> 01:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
um May maybe I'll just speak generally
 
01:32:28.080 --> 01:32:28.870 align:start position:0%
um May maybe I'll just speak generally
to

01:32:28.870 --> 01:32:28.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:32:33.149 --> 01:32:33.159 align:start position:0%
testing um PCR detects the actual
 
01:32:35.270 --> 01:32:35.280 align:start position:0%
genetic material of the virus it's a
 
01:32:39.870 --> 01:32:39.880 align:start position:0%
very very sensitive test um has a higher
 
01:32:41.629 --> 01:32:41.639 align:start position:0%
what we call sensitivity meaning it has
 
01:32:44.750 --> 01:32:44.760 align:start position:0%
a higher ability to detect infection
 
01:32:46.870 --> 01:32:46.880 align:start position:0%
particularly lower levels of infection
 
01:32:50.550 --> 01:32:50.560 align:start position:0%
infection earlier on um the the downside
 
01:32:53.350 --> 01:32:53.360 align:start position:0%
of the PCR test that we that we realized
 
01:32:56.229 --> 01:32:56.239 align:start position:0%
as as we were testing people uh was that
 
01:32:58.950 --> 01:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
they can even after they were no longer
 
01:33:01.870 --> 01:33:01.880 align:start position:0%
likely infectious meaning no longer able
 
01:33:03.189 --> 01:33:03.199 align:start position:0%
to spread it to other people that people
 
01:33:05.189 --> 01:33:05.199 align:start position:0%
could keep testing positive because of
 
01:33:06.709 --> 01:33:06.719 align:start position:0%
how sensitive the test
 
01:33:10.350 --> 01:33:10.360 align:start position:0%
was um for like sometimes days and weeks
 
01:33:12.229 --> 01:33:12.239 align:start position:0%
after they were
 
01:33:16.229 --> 01:33:16.239 align:start position:0%
infected um so that that became an an
 
01:33:19.790 --> 01:33:19.800 align:start position:0%
issue because early on there was a
 
01:33:22.550 --> 01:33:22.560 align:start position:0%
recommendation that people were
 
01:33:25.870 --> 01:33:25.880 align:start position:0%
infected which talking like very
 
01:33:27.950 --> 01:33:27.960 align:start position:0%
beginning of 2020 people that were
 
01:33:30.950 --> 01:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
infected could be let off isolation once
 
01:33:34.470 --> 01:33:34.480 align:start position:0%
they tested negative by PCR tests and so
 
01:33:35.950 --> 01:33:35.960 align:start position:0%
we had examples even in New Hampshire
 
01:33:37.870 --> 01:33:37.880 align:start position:0%
where we were testing people for like a
 
01:33:39.990 --> 01:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
couple of weeks more than two weeks and
 
01:33:41.910 --> 01:33:41.920 align:start position:0%
they were still testing positive and
 
01:33:43.750 --> 01:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
then we realized oh they're like they're
 
01:33:45.910 --> 01:33:45.920 align:start position:0%
totally asymptomatic all their symptoms
 
01:33:47.870 --> 01:33:47.880 align:start position:0%
are gone like they're still testing
 
01:33:49.550 --> 01:33:49.560 align:start position:0%
positive like this isn't a reasonable
 
01:33:52.910 --> 01:33:52.920 align:start position:0%
approach to using for using PCR testing
 
01:33:54.310 --> 01:33:54.320 align:start position:0%
and so the
 
01:33:57.790 --> 01:33:57.800 align:start position:0%
the that quickly switched from you know
 
01:33:59.870 --> 01:33:59.880 align:start position:0%
get off isolation by testing negative to
 
01:34:02.310 --> 01:34:02.320 align:start position:0%
more of a Time based you know after one
 
01:34:04.709 --> 01:34:04.719 align:start position:0%
to two weeks for example you know after
 
01:34:06.510 --> 01:34:06.520 align:start position:0%
being ill you don't have to stay at home
 
01:34:07.590 --> 01:34:07.600 align:start position:0%
anymore we don't think you're still
 
01:34:09.229 --> 01:34:09.239 align:start position:0%
likely to spread it to other
 
01:34:12.030 --> 01:34:12.040 align:start position:0%
people um I think the larger issue
 
01:34:14.350 --> 01:34:14.360 align:start position:0%
around testing was around antigen tests
 
01:34:16.950 --> 01:34:16.960 align:start position:0%
right those are um tests that detect not
 
01:34:20.030 --> 01:34:20.040 align:start position:0%
the genetic material of the virus but um
 
01:34:21.990 --> 01:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
antigens or particles on the outside of
 
01:34:25.750 --> 01:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
the of the virus those um very early on
 
01:34:29.109 --> 01:34:29.119 align:start position:0%
even when they first rolled out in April
 
01:34:30.830 --> 01:34:30.840 align:start position:0%
or May of
 
01:34:33.709 --> 01:34:33.719 align:start position:0%
2020 um the data that was emerging show
 
01:34:35.470 --> 01:34:35.480 align:start position:0%
was showing that there were problems
 
01:34:38.109 --> 01:34:38.119 align:start position:0%
with false positives and false negatives
 
01:34:39.430 --> 01:34:39.440 align:start position:0%
right false negatives because they
 
01:34:41.350 --> 01:34:41.360 align:start position:0%
weren't sensitive enough to detect
 
01:34:44.430 --> 01:34:44.440 align:start position:0%
infection early um more concerningly
 
01:34:46.189 --> 01:34:46.199 align:start position:0%
though there was a certain there was a
 
01:34:49.149 --> 01:34:49.159 align:start position:0%
high false positive rate and so this was
 
01:34:51.390 --> 01:34:51.400 align:start position:0%
another area of the the literature that
 
01:34:53.189 --> 01:34:53.199 align:start position:0%
we were continually monitoring of like
 
01:34:54.790 --> 01:34:54.800 align:start position:0%
looking at the different tests that were
 
01:34:57.270 --> 01:34:57.280 align:start position:0%
done and realizing that um some of these
 
01:34:59.310 --> 01:34:59.320 align:start position:0%
had like a high false positive and false
 
01:35:01.709 --> 01:35:01.719 align:start position:0%
negative rate and that's partly why when
 
01:35:03.270 --> 01:35:03.280 align:start position:0%
the federal government ruled these out
 
01:35:05.070 --> 01:35:05.080 align:start position:0%
to use in long-term care facilities we
 
01:35:06.990 --> 01:35:07.000 align:start position:0%
said no don't use the antigen tests
 
01:35:08.750 --> 01:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to set up a PCR testing
 
01:35:11.270 --> 01:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
program instead um which is what we did
 
01:35:12.990 --> 01:35:13.000 align:start position:0%
but that that was a problem with antigen
 
01:35:15.870 --> 01:35:15.880 align:start position:0%
tests and that was recognized early on
 
01:35:18.790 --> 01:35:18.800 align:start position:0%
um even you know April May certainly by
 
01:35:22.030 --> 01:35:22.040 align:start position:0%
June 2020 um the data was emerging that
 
01:35:23.030 --> 01:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
there were there were problems with
 
01:35:25.910 --> 01:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
using an tests for screening
 
01:35:28.229 --> 01:35:28.239 align:start position:0%
asymptomatic people right that's that's
 
01:35:29.790 --> 01:35:29.800 align:start position:0%
how they were being promoted so the
 
01:35:31.350 --> 01:35:31.360 align:start position:0%
other aspect of this was using these
 
01:35:33.149 --> 01:35:33.159 align:start position:0%
tests for testing people that were
 
01:35:35.470 --> 01:35:35.480 align:start position:0%
symptomatic versus te you know screening
 
01:35:37.310 --> 01:35:37.320 align:start position:0%
people that were asymptomatic to see if
 
01:35:40.870 --> 01:35:40.880 align:start position:0%
they were infected um and so both both
 
01:35:43.270 --> 01:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
of these were needed to be factored into
 
01:35:45.390 --> 01:35:45.400 align:start position:0%
how they were used and antigen tests
 
01:35:47.390 --> 01:35:47.400 align:start position:0%
just had a lot of problems with using
 
01:35:49.990 --> 01:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
them for screening now later on in the
 
01:35:52.310 --> 01:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
pandemic um as they became more widely
 
01:35:54.270 --> 01:35:54.280 align:start position:0%
available over the counter
 
01:35:56.550 --> 01:35:56.560 align:start position:0%
there there was um and you know as PCR
 
01:35:59.149 --> 01:35:59.159 align:start position:0%
testing became more you know it was more
 
01:36:00.790 --> 01:36:00.800 align:start position:0%
expensive that's the downside of PCR
 
01:36:03.390 --> 01:36:03.400 align:start position:0%
testing there um there was more of a
 
01:36:05.990 --> 01:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
shift to allowing use of antigen tests
 
01:36:09.750 --> 01:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
for um screening if somebody was exposed
 
01:36:11.229 --> 01:36:11.239 align:start position:0%
but that was with the caveat that it
 
01:36:14.030 --> 01:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
required multiple tests uh so I think it
 
01:36:17.149 --> 01:36:17.159 align:start position:0%
was like 2022 maybe when the FDA finally
 
01:36:18.669 --> 01:36:18.679 align:start position:0%
came out and said that if you're using
 
01:36:21.629 --> 01:36:21.639 align:start position:0%
antigen tests for asymptomatic screening
 
01:36:24.510 --> 01:36:24.520 align:start position:0%
you need a series of like three tests
 
01:36:26.870 --> 01:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
over several days to you know be
 
01:36:28.669 --> 01:36:28.679 align:start position:0%
confident that that if it's negative it
 
01:36:30.990 --> 01:36:31.000 align:start position:0%
truly is negative um and that that was
 
01:36:32.709 --> 01:36:32.719 align:start position:0%
the kind of data that was you know was
 
01:36:35.550 --> 01:36:35.560 align:start position:0%
not new data uh that data had was
 
01:36:38.550 --> 01:36:38.560 align:start position:0%
emerging throughout 2020 um and factored
 
01:36:41.270 --> 01:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
into our recommendation early on not to
 
01:36:44.270 --> 01:36:44.280 align:start position:0%
use antigen tests for asymptomatic
 
01:36:49.669 --> 01:36:49.679 align:start position:0%
screening uh followup yes thank you um
 
01:36:53.109 --> 01:36:53.119 align:start position:0%
so so taking stepping back from that uh
 
01:36:54.709 --> 01:36:54.719 align:start position:0%
which I think is a great example you
 
01:36:57.270 --> 01:36:57.280 align:start position:0%
know you have you're dealing with known
 
01:36:59.510 --> 01:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
and unknown data you're dealing with in
 
01:36:59.520 --> 01:37:00.750 align:start position:0%
and unknown data you're dealing with in
some

01:37:00.750 --> 01:37:00.760 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:37:04.229 --> 01:37:04.239 align:start position:0%
situations um you know bad science you
 
01:37:06.550 --> 01:37:06.560 align:start position:0%
know there's a poor design or a poor
 
01:37:08.350 --> 01:37:08.360 align:start position:0%
understanding like like you mentioned
 
01:37:12.030 --> 01:37:12.040 align:start position:0%
with the antigen for asymptomatic uh
 
01:37:14.709 --> 01:37:14.719 align:start position:0%
screening um there's poorly executed
 
01:37:17.470 --> 01:37:17.480 align:start position:0%
studies or insufficient data collection
 
01:37:19.590 --> 01:37:19.600 align:start position:0%
how do
 
01:37:24.430 --> 01:37:24.440 align:start position:0%
you how do you discern that process
 
01:37:26.470 --> 01:37:26.480 align:start position:0%
you know or in that in that process of
 
01:37:30.950 --> 01:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
reviewing all this literature how do you
 
01:37:33.950 --> 01:37:33.960 align:start position:0%
discern when you have this bad sort of
 
01:37:36.870 --> 01:37:36.880 align:start position:0%
science emerge how do you do you choose
 
01:37:39.990 --> 01:37:40.000 align:start position:0%
to make that known or do you choose
 
01:37:42.709 --> 01:37:42.719 align:start position:0%
to uh just point people in the direction
 
01:37:45.669 --> 01:37:45.679 align:start position:0%
of what you think is good or do you does
 
01:37:47.510 --> 01:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
part of the communication especially to
 
01:37:50.189 --> 01:37:50.199 align:start position:0%
like Health Care Providers or hey we
 
01:37:51.669 --> 01:37:51.679 align:start position:0%
we've had this situation where we're
 
01:37:53.790 --> 01:37:53.800 align:start position:0%
feeling like we're not getting good
 
01:37:56.229 --> 01:37:56.239 align:start position:0%
because of this situation you know is
 
01:37:58.589 --> 01:37:58.599 align:start position:0%
that being shared with Healthcare
 
01:38:02.109 --> 01:38:02.119 align:start position:0%
Providers is it you know so yeah and so
 
01:38:04.430 --> 01:38:04.440 align:start position:0%
that's a great question and um the short
 
01:38:07.310 --> 01:38:07.320 align:start position:0%
answer during the pandemic response
 
01:38:08.830 --> 01:38:08.840 align:start position:0%
right when
 
01:38:11.870 --> 01:38:11.880 align:start position:0%
we're reviewing articles on a daily
 
01:38:14.350 --> 01:38:14.360 align:start position:0%
basis um was yes we sh we shared it with
 
01:38:15.990 --> 01:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
Healthcare Providers we put it out in
 
01:38:17.950 --> 01:38:17.960 align:start position:0%
health alert Network messages we sent
 
01:38:19.870 --> 01:38:19.880 align:start position:0%
out our Han messaging system we were
 
01:38:22.510 --> 01:38:22.520 align:start position:0%
sharing you know actual data and even
 
01:38:24.709 --> 01:38:24.719 align:start position:0%
pre-print public ations with Healthcare
 
01:38:26.790 --> 01:38:26.800 align:start position:0%
Providers on weekly webinars we were
 
01:38:29.070 --> 01:38:29.080 align:start position:0%
having um you know and a lot of that was
 
01:38:30.790 --> 01:38:30.800 align:start position:0%
to explain like why are we taking a
 
01:38:31.910 --> 01:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
different approach from the federal
 
01:38:34.430 --> 01:38:34.440 align:start position:0%
government when it comes to testing um
 
01:38:37.350 --> 01:38:37.360 align:start position:0%
you know why why is New Hampshire saying
 
01:38:39.830 --> 01:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
that people that are vaccinated who are
 
01:38:42.070 --> 01:38:42.080 align:start position:0%
exposed to covid-19 no longer need to
 
01:38:43.629 --> 01:38:43.639 align:start position:0%
quarantine but the federal government is
 
01:38:44.629 --> 01:38:44.639 align:start position:0%
still telling people they should
 
01:38:45.870 --> 01:38:45.880 align:start position:0%
quarantine even if they've been
 
01:38:48.629 --> 01:38:48.639 align:start position:0%
vaccinated right these are all examples
 
01:38:51.189 --> 01:38:51.199 align:start position:0%
of um times where we've diverged from
 
01:38:53.629 --> 01:38:53.639 align:start position:0%
federal guidance based on the evidence
 
01:38:56.390 --> 01:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
we had available you know at at the time
 
01:38:58.350 --> 01:38:58.360 align:start position:0%
and so you know extrapolating this to
 
01:39:00.510 --> 01:39:00.520 align:start position:0%
issues of you know vaccination you know
 
01:39:03.189 --> 01:39:03.199 align:start position:0%
when when associations are made between
 
01:39:07.109 --> 01:39:07.119 align:start position:0%
the um Jan the Jansen or Janson vaccine
 
01:39:09.030 --> 01:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
and TTS
 
01:39:12.350 --> 01:39:12.360 align:start position:0%
the thrombosis thrombocytopenic uh
 
01:39:14.390 --> 01:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
syndrome you know that's message to
 
01:39:16.350 --> 01:39:16.360 align:start position:0%
healthcare providers when there's an
 
01:39:18.629 --> 01:39:18.639 align:start position:0%
association between you know covid-19
 
01:39:20.470 --> 01:39:20.480 align:start position:0%
vaccines and myocarditis that that's
 
01:39:22.910 --> 01:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
messaged to healthcare providers not not
 
01:39:24.790 --> 01:39:24.800 align:start position:0%
that we're in our own messaging that you
 
01:39:26.510 --> 01:39:26.520 align:start position:0%
know that gets put out at at a federal
 
01:39:28.470 --> 01:39:28.480 align:start position:0%
level too like you know the vaccine
 
01:39:31.030 --> 01:39:31.040 align:start position:0%
information sheets for example the
 
01:39:33.830 --> 01:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
package inserts you know all all contain
 
01:39:35.990 --> 01:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
the data out there that decisions are
 
01:39:38.310 --> 01:39:38.320 align:start position:0%
based on for medical recommendations and
 
01:39:41.990 --> 01:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
the um possible side effects from use of
 
01:39:43.629 --> 01:39:43.639 align:start position:0%
the vaccine so it's not like that that
 
01:39:45.390 --> 01:39:45.400 align:start position:0%
information is being hidden or not being
 
01:39:47.470 --> 01:39:47.480 align:start position:0%
put out there but we certainly take
 
01:39:49.270 --> 01:39:49.280 align:start position:0%
steps to make that information available
 
01:39:50.669 --> 01:39:50.679 align:start position:0%
but it's already available at a federal
 
01:39:52.790 --> 01:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
level put out through you know package
 
01:39:55.030 --> 01:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
inserts vaccine information statements
 
01:39:56.589 --> 01:39:56.599 align:start position:0%
and fact sheets put out by the federal
 
01:39:57.790 --> 01:39:57.800 align:start position:0%
government which are available for
 
01:39:59.149 --> 01:39:59.159 align:start position:0%
healthcare providers to use that are
 
01:39:59.159 --> 01:40:01.950 align:start position:0%
healthcare providers to use that are
vaccinating

01:40:01.950 --> 01:40:01.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:04.070 --> 01:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
people one
 
01:40:06.709 --> 01:40:06.719 align:start position:0%
more thank you
 
01:40:10.350 --> 01:40:10.360 align:start position:0%
um on a different tact
 
01:40:13.550 --> 01:40:13.560 align:start position:0%
um we know that uh different country
 
01:40:15.350 --> 01:40:15.360 align:start position:0%
well we talked about or you you
 
01:40:17.910 --> 01:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned specifically uh different
 
01:40:19.629 --> 01:40:19.639 align:start position:0%
states and different countries take
 
01:40:22.229 --> 01:40:22.239 align:start position:0%
Taking different tax and approaches for
 
01:40:25.950 --> 01:40:25.960 align:start position:0%
this and and we know for example Israel
 
01:40:28.350 --> 01:40:28.360 align:start position:0%
was fully vaccinated Sweden was barely
 
01:40:29.669 --> 01:40:29.679 align:start position:0%
or rarely
 
01:40:32.030 --> 01:40:32.040 align:start position:0%
vaccinated were
 
01:40:36.709 --> 01:40:36.719 align:start position:0%
you was the DHHS also evaluating kind of
 
01:40:38.709 --> 01:40:38.719 align:start position:0%
those situations or you know do you have
 
01:40:44.589 --> 01:40:44.599 align:start position:0%
the resources to to look at not just um
 
01:40:47.270 --> 01:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
you know the differences between what
 
01:40:50.109 --> 01:40:50.119 align:start position:0%
states are doing domestically but also
 
01:40:53.669 --> 01:40:53.679 align:start position:0%
what different countries are doing
 
01:40:55.510 --> 01:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
so I think there's two aspects of your
 
01:41:00.030 --> 01:41:00.040 align:start position:0%
question one is um policies that
 
01:41:03.310 --> 01:41:03.320 align:start position:0%
other places are making or
 
01:41:05.510 --> 01:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
recommendations um and and certainly for
 
01:41:06.750 --> 01:41:06.760 align:start position:0%
example we were aware during the
 
01:41:08.470 --> 01:41:08.480 align:start position:0%
pandemic of what Sweden was doing
 
01:41:11.310 --> 01:41:11.320 align:start position:0%
because it was in the news um the other
 
01:41:15.149 --> 01:41:15.159 align:start position:0%
aspect is science put out um there was
 
01:41:17.790 --> 01:41:17.800 align:start position:0%
there were a lot of studies coming out
 
01:41:20.390 --> 01:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
of um the Israeli
 
01:41:22.990 --> 01:41:23.000 align:start position:0%
population I believe I heard partly
 
01:41:26.229 --> 01:41:26.239 align:start position:0%
because because fizer had an agreement
 
01:41:29.189 --> 01:41:29.199 align:start position:0%
with the government to make vaccine
 
01:41:30.750 --> 01:41:30.760 align:start position:0%
available and hence studied in their
 
01:41:33.070 --> 01:41:33.080 align:start position:0%
population and and that promoted you
 
01:41:36.589 --> 01:41:36.599 align:start position:0%
know scientific studies being published
 
01:41:39.830 --> 01:41:39.840 align:start position:0%
um on use in that population which
 
01:41:41.870 --> 01:41:41.880 align:start position:0%
certainly we reviewed so that was part
 
01:41:43.149 --> 01:41:43.159 align:start position:0%
of what we were reviewing but it wasn't
 
01:41:45.270 --> 01:41:45.280 align:start position:0%
just studies coming out of you know use
 
01:41:48.149 --> 01:41:48.159 align:start position:0%
of the fiser vaccine for example in the
 
01:41:50.709 --> 01:41:50.719 align:start position:0%
Israeli population we were also getting
 
01:41:51.910 --> 01:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
studies from all other countries that
 
01:41:53.229 --> 01:41:53.239 align:start position:0%
were publishing them so that that's part
 
01:41:54.870 --> 01:41:54.880 align:start position:0%
part of like the scientific process of
 
01:41:56.629 --> 01:41:56.639 align:start position:0%
you know studying and putting out you
 
01:41:58.070 --> 01:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
know scientific studies and that's
 
01:42:01.390 --> 01:42:01.400 align:start position:0%
that's primarily what we focus on not um
 
01:42:04.310 --> 01:42:04.320 align:start position:0%
not necessarily comparison of you know
 
01:42:05.709 --> 01:42:05.719 align:start position:0%
what Sweden is doing or what another
 
01:42:06.550 --> 01:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
country is doing with their
 
01:42:08.430 --> 01:42:08.440 align:start position:0%
recommendation but more on what is the
 
01:42:10.470 --> 01:42:10.480 align:start position:0%
science that's emerging whether it's
 
01:42:12.470 --> 01:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
science from Sweden or science from you
 
01:42:14.470 --> 01:42:14.480 align:start position:0%
know Israel or science from the US or
 
01:42:18.109 --> 01:42:18.119 align:start position:0%
science from you know the UK um it it's
 
01:42:20.550 --> 01:42:20.560 align:start position:0%
just a a fact that some of these other
 
01:42:23.310 --> 01:42:23.320 align:start position:0%
countries have systems better set up to
 
01:42:26.189 --> 01:42:26.199 align:start position:0%
be able to conduct the science and so
 
01:42:28.790 --> 01:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
you know Israel the UK were countries
 
01:42:30.109 --> 01:42:30.119 align:start position:0%
that were putting out a lot of Science
 
01:42:31.709 --> 01:42:31.719 align:start position:0%
and a lot of evidence and data that we
 
01:42:33.790 --> 01:42:33.800 align:start position:0%
were reviewing you know during during
 
01:42:33.800 --> 01:42:34.910 align:start position:0%
were reviewing you know during during
the

01:42:34.910 --> 01:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:42:36.990 --> 01:42:37.000 align:start position:0%
pandemic represent
 
01:42:41.990 --> 01:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
Gro thank you madam chair um Dr Chan I'm
 
01:42:43.430 --> 01:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
listening to the questions and I'm
 
01:42:44.950 --> 01:42:44.960 align:start position:0%
listening to your answers and I'm
 
01:42:44.960 --> 01:42:46.310 align:start position:0%
listening to your answers and I'm
thinking

01:42:46.310 --> 01:42:46.320 align:start position:0%
thinking
 
01:42:49.629 --> 01:42:49.639 align:start position:0%
that the this
 
01:42:52.390 --> 01:42:52.400 align:start position:0%
committee is trying to I think be
 
01:42:52.400 --> 01:42:53.669 align:start position:0%
committee is trying to I think be
helpful

01:42:53.669 --> 01:42:53.679 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
01:42:55.470 --> 01:42:55.480 align:start position:0%
to Granite
 
01:43:01.709 --> 01:43:01.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:05.149 --> 01:43:05.159 align:start position:0%
that what the actions that we
 
01:43:09.229 --> 01:43:09.239 align:start position:0%
took as a result of the covid pandemic
 
01:43:10.910 --> 01:43:10.920 align:start position:0%
may not be
 
01:43:13.669 --> 01:43:13.679 align:start position:0%
translatable to another
 
01:43:17.229 --> 01:43:17.239 align:start position:0%
pandemic or what have we what's the is
 
01:43:19.950 --> 01:43:19.960 align:start position:0%
there a Continuum or things that we
 
01:43:22.430 --> 01:43:22.440 align:start position:0%
do you see what I'm trying to get to
 
01:43:24.709 --> 01:43:24.719 align:start position:0%
like what is it that we can say as a
 
01:43:28.709 --> 01:43:28.719 align:start position:0%
result of this of the things that we've
 
01:43:32.750 --> 01:43:32.760 align:start position:0%
heard are helpful can be used again or
 
01:43:35.109 --> 01:43:35.119 align:start position:0%
not helpful shouldn't be used again I
 
01:43:37.229 --> 01:43:37.239 align:start position:0%
don't think we can make any of those
 
01:43:39.629 --> 01:43:39.639 align:start position:0%
recommendations because I do I my
 
01:43:42.350 --> 01:43:42.360 align:start position:0%
thought is after listening to you is
 
01:43:46.070 --> 01:43:46.080 align:start position:0%
that what we learn from what we've
 
01:43:49.990 --> 01:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:52.589 --> 01:43:52.599 align:start position:0%
translatable so I think I think there
 
01:43:54.629 --> 01:43:54.639 align:start position:0%
are things that so thank you for that
 
01:43:56.430 --> 01:43:56.440 align:start position:0%
question that's actually a um I think
 
01:43:59.629 --> 01:43:59.639 align:start position:0%
really important and relevant question I
 
01:44:01.430 --> 01:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
think there are things that are
 
01:44:04.109 --> 01:44:04.119 align:start position:0%
translatable um but there are going to
 
01:44:06.589 --> 01:44:06.599 align:start position:0%
always be differences in the specifics
 
01:44:09.910 --> 01:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
and the details right
 
01:44:09.920 --> 01:44:11.550 align:start position:0%
and the details right
um

01:44:11.550 --> 01:44:11.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:15.550 --> 01:44:15.560 align:start position:0%
so what you're getting at is an issue of
 
01:44:17.510 --> 01:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
emergency preparedness and response
 
01:44:19.350 --> 01:44:19.360 align:start position:0%
that's the sort of the the category I
 
01:44:21.229 --> 01:44:21.239 align:start position:0%
would lump it it in preparedness and
 
01:44:23.149 --> 01:44:23.159 align:start position:0%
response or public health preparedness
 
01:44:23.159 --> 01:44:23.910 align:start position:0%
response or public health preparedness
and

01:44:23.910 --> 01:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:44:23.920 --> 01:44:26.149 align:start position:0%
and
response

01:44:26.149 --> 01:44:26.159 align:start position:0%
response
 
01:44:26.159 --> 01:44:28.270 align:start position:0%
response
um

01:44:28.270 --> 01:44:28.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:31.629 --> 01:44:31.639 align:start position:0%
and I I think there's a few sort of
 
01:44:34.430 --> 01:44:34.440 align:start position:0%
takeaways and I'm sorry as I I'm pausing
 
01:44:37.430 --> 01:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
because because I'm thinking
 
01:44:39.629 --> 01:44:39.639 align:start position:0%
um the first relative to the
 
01:44:41.750 --> 01:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
conversation about Therapeutics and
 
01:44:44.430 --> 01:44:44.440 align:start position:0%
vaccines yeah if I could
 
01:44:46.510 --> 01:44:46.520 align:start position:0%
interject if there's other things that
 
01:44:50.149 --> 01:44:50.159 align:start position:0%
you think about please let chair come to
 
01:44:51.750 --> 01:44:51.760 align:start position:0%
I know and she can disseminate because
 
01:44:54.030 --> 01:44:54.040 align:start position:0%
this is I think a come you know could be
 
01:44:55.709 --> 01:44:55.719 align:start position:0%
a complicated
 
01:45:00.470 --> 01:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
question it's a long-term question yes
 
01:45:04.510 --> 01:45:04.520 align:start position:0%
um so I think there are so relative to
 
01:45:05.750 --> 01:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
the conversation about sort of
 
01:45:09.870 --> 01:45:09.880 align:start position:0%
Therapeutics and vaccines there
 
01:45:13.790 --> 01:45:13.800 align:start position:0%
are federal scientific processes already
 
01:45:16.550 --> 01:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
established by which things like
 
01:45:19.870 --> 01:45:19.880 align:start position:0%
Therapeutics get reviewed and approved
 
01:45:23.510 --> 01:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
by the FDA and then recommended by a
 
01:45:25.629 --> 01:45:25.639 align:start position:0%
medical group of professionals that
 
01:45:27.950 --> 01:45:27.960 align:start position:0%
review the science right in normal
 
01:45:31.030 --> 01:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
peacetime if you will we we rely heavily
 
01:45:35.830 --> 01:45:35.840 align:start position:0%
on that typical process um you know and
 
01:45:37.109 --> 01:45:37.119 align:start position:0%
we have access to the data and the
 
01:45:39.870 --> 01:45:39.880 align:start position:0%
science ourselves as well during a
 
01:45:42.589 --> 01:45:42.599 align:start position:0%
pandemic we engage in more intensive
 
01:45:45.510 --> 01:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
review of the science behind that for
 
01:45:47.990 --> 01:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
the purposes of understanding the
 
01:45:51.109 --> 01:45:51.119 align:start position:0%
recommendations being able to craft
 
01:45:54.709 --> 01:45:54.719 align:start position:0%
messaging um and if we need to like we
 
01:45:56.310 --> 01:45:56.320 align:start position:0%
did during the pandemic you know if
 
01:45:59.030 --> 01:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
we're setting up statun vaccination
 
01:46:02.629 --> 01:46:02.639 align:start position:0%
sites um we're responsible for the
 
01:46:06.669 --> 01:46:06.679 align:start position:0%
messaging that's done to patients to
 
01:46:08.870 --> 01:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
providers who are delivering
 
01:46:12.870 --> 01:46:12.880 align:start position:0%
vaccine um and so there's a higher
 
01:46:16.910 --> 01:46:16.920 align:start position:0%
greater need um and importance to
 
01:46:18.669 --> 01:46:18.679 align:start position:0%
understanding a lot of the Nuance of the
 
01:46:20.870 --> 01:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
science during a pandemic right and so
 
01:46:23.070 --> 01:46:23.080 align:start position:0%
there are processes there that are set
 
01:46:26.990 --> 01:46:27.000 align:start position:0%
up routinely at Baseline that we then
 
01:46:29.750 --> 01:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
have to engage in more um intensively
 
01:46:31.910 --> 01:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
during something like a pandemic that's
 
01:46:33.270 --> 01:46:33.280 align:start position:0%
relative to the to the to the
 
01:46:35.030 --> 01:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
Therapeutics but I'll just say relative
 
01:46:39.229 --> 01:46:39.239 align:start position:0%
to the response as a whole um a lot of a
 
01:46:43.149 --> 01:46:43.159 align:start position:0%
lot of our ability to respond
 
01:46:46.750 --> 01:46:46.760 align:start position:0%
effectively I think comes down to some
 
01:46:48.470 --> 01:46:48.480 align:start position:0%
general principles which have already
 
01:46:50.510 --> 01:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
been highlighted one is an issue of
 
01:46:52.229 --> 01:46:52.239 align:start position:0%
Workforce having the people to do the
 
01:46:54.750 --> 01:46:54.760 align:start position:0%
work the other that I I I haven't
 
01:46:57.430 --> 01:46:57.440 align:start position:0%
mentioned yet um and am remiss because I
 
01:47:00.109 --> 01:47:00.119 align:start position:0%
should have is Partnerships right we we
 
01:47:02.390 --> 01:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
can't do Public Health work without the
 
01:47:05.470 --> 01:47:05.480 align:start position:0%
Partnerships of a great number of other
 
01:47:07.390 --> 01:47:07.400 align:start position:0%
people um
 
01:47:11.629 --> 01:47:11.639 align:start position:0%
both inter a intra agency so ton of
 
01:47:14.430 --> 01:47:14.440 align:start position:0%
people were involved in the covid
 
01:47:15.990 --> 01:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
response within the Department of Health
 
01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:16.950 align:start position:0%
response within the Department of Health
Human

01:47:16.950 --> 01:47:16.960 align:start position:0%
Human
 
01:47:19.910 --> 01:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
Services then you had probably every
 
01:47:21.430 --> 01:47:21.440 align:start position:0%
other department in state government
 
01:47:24.830 --> 01:47:24.840 align:start position:0%
involved in the response in some way um
 
01:47:26.910 --> 01:47:26.920 align:start position:0%
and we had to engage our Health Care
 
01:47:28.510 --> 01:47:28.520 align:start position:0%
system and our Healthcare Providers and
 
01:47:30.750 --> 01:47:30.760 align:start position:0%
our schools and our businesses and you
 
01:47:31.750 --> 01:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
know I remember even having
 
01:47:33.550 --> 01:47:33.560 align:start position:0%
conversations with you know faith-based
 
01:47:36.390 --> 01:47:36.400 align:start position:0%
organizations so like it it really is an
 
01:47:40.149 --> 01:47:40.159 align:start position:0%
an issue of if building those
 
01:47:42.750 --> 01:47:42.760 align:start position:0%
Partnerships ahead of time will better
 
01:47:44.870 --> 01:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
allow us or allow us to be in a better
 
01:47:47.070 --> 01:47:47.080 align:start position:0%
position to respond to an emergency you
 
01:47:48.669 --> 01:47:48.679 align:start position:0%
know if and if and when it's needed so
 
01:47:50.270 --> 01:47:50.280 align:start position:0%
that comes down to Partnerships but also
 
01:47:52.229 --> 01:47:52.239 align:start position:0%
somewhat the the the having the systems
 
01:47:54.870 --> 01:47:54.880 align:start position:0%
established to be able to you know when
 
01:47:56.589 --> 01:47:56.599 align:start position:0%
there's an empo outbreak and we need to
 
01:47:59.189 --> 01:47:59.199 align:start position:0%
roll out an empo vaccine to make sure
 
01:48:00.550 --> 01:48:00.560 align:start position:0%
that the systems are in place to be able
 
01:48:04.109 --> 01:48:04.119 align:start position:0%
to do that efficiently um just as an
 
01:48:06.149 --> 01:48:06.159 align:start position:0%
example um and then the other aspect
 
01:48:07.830 --> 01:48:07.840 align:start position:0%
that I think you highlighted earlier was
 
01:48:10.390 --> 01:48:10.400 align:start position:0%
around communication um communication is
 
01:48:12.950 --> 01:48:12.960 align:start position:0%
critical and it depends on um not just
 
01:48:14.550 --> 01:48:14.560 align:start position:0%
Public Communication communication with
 
01:48:17.149 --> 01:48:17.159 align:start position:0%
Healthcare Providers communication with
 
01:48:20.070 --> 01:48:20.080 align:start position:0%
um you know maybe subpopulations that
 
01:48:23.510 --> 01:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
are impacted by a disease um
 
01:48:25.750 --> 01:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
so I I I think that there are things
 
01:48:27.910 --> 01:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
that can be done during peace time if
 
01:48:33.990 --> 01:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
you will to um have a you know to to
 
01:48:35.589 --> 01:48:35.599 align:start position:0%
have those systems and Partnerships in
 
01:48:37.030 --> 01:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
place to have those communication
 
01:48:39.109 --> 01:48:39.119 align:start position:0%
mechanisms you know set up and and again
 
01:48:40.430 --> 01:48:40.440 align:start position:0%
a lot of this was highlighted I think in
 
01:48:44.229 --> 01:48:44.239 align:start position:0%
the after Action Report um by H HSM
 
01:48:46.510 --> 01:48:46.520 align:start position:0%
around you know the Partnerships and you
 
01:48:49.430 --> 01:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
know the training and the practicing and
 
01:48:50.950 --> 01:48:50.960 align:start position:0%
um making sure that people are aware of
 
01:48:53.669 --> 01:48:53.679 align:start position:0%
their role during uh um during a
 
01:48:56.910 --> 01:48:56.920 align:start position:0%
response um the most of what we deal
 
01:48:58.430 --> 01:48:58.440 align:start position:0%
with in public health does not rise to
 
01:49:00.270 --> 01:49:00.280 align:start position:0%
the level of a global pandemic like
 
01:49:01.950 --> 01:49:01.960 align:start position:0%
covid-19 and so the scale of the
 
01:49:04.990 --> 01:49:05.000 align:start position:0%
response hopefully is once every you
 
01:49:07.030 --> 01:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
know hundred year if that you know
 
01:49:08.950 --> 01:49:08.960 align:start position:0%
response that required to do but you
 
01:49:11.470 --> 01:49:11.480 align:start position:0%
know in any given year there's still a
 
01:49:13.390 --> 01:49:13.400 align:start position:0%
variety of issues we have to respond to
 
01:49:15.310 --> 01:49:15.320 align:start position:0%
I mean just over the summer we were
 
01:49:18.149 --> 01:49:18.159 align:start position:0%
dealing with andox Resurgence and then a
 
01:49:23.270 --> 01:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
measles outbreak and um uh you know Aven
 
01:49:25.870 --> 01:49:25.880 align:start position:0%
influenza you know in dairy cattle and
 
01:49:27.790 --> 01:49:27.800 align:start position:0%
people getting infected and now there's
 
01:49:30.430 --> 01:49:30.440 align:start position:0%
marberg virus so you know I mean that's
 
01:49:32.830 --> 01:49:32.840 align:start position:0%
I missing some there um but there's
 
01:49:35.629 --> 01:49:35.639 align:start position:0%
always diseases and outbreaks and not
 
01:49:37.229 --> 01:49:37.239 align:start position:0%
just infectious diseases that we're
 
01:49:39.830 --> 01:49:39.840 align:start position:0%
responding to you know toxicology issues
 
01:49:41.550 --> 01:49:41.560 align:start position:0%
people Expo being exposed to you know
 
01:49:43.990 --> 01:49:44.000 align:start position:0%
opioids as an ongoing issue there was a
 
01:49:47.070 --> 01:49:47.080 align:start position:0%
anyways I won't belabor the point but
 
01:49:48.550 --> 01:49:48.560 align:start position:0%
you know that the more that we can build
 
01:49:50.830 --> 01:49:50.840 align:start position:0%
up these Partnerships and and practice
 
01:49:53.070 --> 01:49:53.080 align:start position:0%
and train together the better response
 
01:49:53.080 --> 01:49:54.430 align:start position:0%
and train together the better response
will

01:49:54.430 --> 01:49:54.440 align:start position:0%
will
 
01:49:57.350 --> 01:49:57.360 align:start position:0%
be um yeah I remember and thank you for
 
01:49:58.830 --> 01:49:58.840 align:start position:0%
bringing that up but I do remember
 
01:50:00.709 --> 01:50:00.719 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic a lot of businesses
 
01:50:03.270 --> 01:50:03.280 align:start position:0%
flipping over what they were doing uh to
 
01:50:05.950 --> 01:50:05.960 align:start position:0%
help like hand sanitizer and things like
 
01:50:10.510 --> 01:50:10.520 align:start position:0%
that um and really came together to help
 
01:50:13.189 --> 01:50:13.199 align:start position:0%
uh for the public health um and worked
 
01:50:14.870 --> 01:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
with the state
 
01:50:19.030 --> 01:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
agencies um so uh representative beler I
 
01:50:20.270 --> 01:50:20.280 align:start position:0%
I just want to say I do have a hard stop
 
01:50:21.910 --> 01:50:21.920 align:start position:0%
at 11 I have another meeting that I have
 
01:50:25.430 --> 01:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
to transition to at 11 thank you madam
 
01:50:26.709 --> 01:50:26.719 align:start position:0%
chair I'll try to get through this
 
01:50:29.470 --> 01:50:29.480 align:start position:0%
quickly then um so just to rewind a
 
01:50:30.709 --> 01:50:30.719 align:start position:0%
little bit we talked about the
 
01:50:32.910 --> 01:50:32.920 align:start position:0%
difference droplet versus Airborne at
 
01:50:34.470 --> 01:50:34.480 align:start position:0%
what point was it apparent to Public
 
01:50:36.589 --> 01:50:36.599 align:start position:0%
Health authorities that this was in fact
 
01:50:41.470 --> 01:50:41.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:44.589 --> 01:50:44.599 align:start position:0%
virus um I I will say that it's a
 
01:50:47.229 --> 01:50:47.239 align:start position:0%
spectrum like any any infection is on a
 
01:50:49.030 --> 01:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
spectrum right so it's not a black and
 
01:50:52.709 --> 01:50:52.719 align:start position:0%
white line of this virus is Airborne and
 
01:50:54.430 --> 01:50:54.440 align:start position:0%
this virus is droplet often times
 
01:50:57.510 --> 01:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
there's there's a spectrum of
 
01:50:59.270 --> 01:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
infectiousness which is partly where you
 
01:51:00.790 --> 01:51:00.800 align:start position:0%
get the r not from at that I think that
 
01:51:02.990 --> 01:51:03.000 align:start position:0%
you referred to
 
01:51:05.990 --> 01:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
um is is a reflection of how infectious
 
01:51:11.669 --> 01:51:11.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:15.310 --> 01:51:15.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:17.709 --> 01:51:17.719 align:start position:0%
was that's that's a little bit of a
 
01:51:20.109 --> 01:51:20.119 align:start position:0%
difficult question to answer because
 
01:51:20.119 --> 01:51:21.310 align:start position:0%
difficult question to answer because
there

01:51:21.310 --> 01:51:21.320 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:51:24.030 --> 01:51:24.040 align:start position:0%
were people people at a national level
 
01:51:25.550 --> 01:51:25.560 align:start position:0%
and actually International level saying
 
01:51:28.310 --> 01:51:28.320 align:start position:0%
this is Airborne this is Airborne um you
 
01:51:30.030 --> 01:51:30.040 align:start position:0%
know it's coming out in the media long
 
01:51:33.069 --> 01:51:33.079 align:start position:0%
before it was clear that it was you
 
01:51:35.589 --> 01:51:35.599 align:start position:0%
know that it that there was a there
 
01:51:37.470 --> 01:51:37.480 align:start position:0%
could could be a significant Airborne
 
01:51:37.480 --> 01:51:39.109 align:start position:0%
could could be a significant Airborne
component

01:51:39.109 --> 01:51:39.119 align:start position:0%
component
 
01:51:42.149 --> 01:51:42.159 align:start position:0%
um so we were we were operating under
 
01:51:43.550 --> 01:51:43.560 align:start position:0%
the assumption that it was primarily
 
01:51:47.750 --> 01:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
droplet for quite a while
 
01:51:51.589 --> 01:51:51.599 align:start position:0%
um into sometime into 2021 and I think
 
01:51:53.550 --> 01:51:53.560 align:start position:0%
over 2021 it became more and more
 
01:51:56.189 --> 01:51:56.199 align:start position:0%
apparent that um there were increasing
 
01:52:00.910 --> 01:52:00.920 align:start position:0%
examples of of Airborne spread
 
01:52:03.870 --> 01:52:03.880 align:start position:0%
um and you know thankfully by then we
 
01:52:06.109 --> 01:52:06.119 align:start position:0%
had a vaccine available and so masking
 
01:52:08.390 --> 01:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
was becoming less and less of of an
 
01:52:10.470 --> 01:52:10.480 align:start position:0%
issue at that point but you know there
 
01:52:12.910 --> 01:52:12.920 align:start position:0%
was still I'm trying to think when when
 
01:52:15.589 --> 01:52:15.599 align:start position:0%
the the federal government even came out
 
01:52:17.229 --> 01:52:17.239 align:start position:0%
with guidance saying that people might
 
01:52:19.750 --> 01:52:19.760 align:start position:0%
want to consider wearing n95 masks in
 
01:52:23.510 --> 01:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
public um I think that was like 2022
 
01:52:25.830 --> 01:52:25.840 align:start position:0%
maybe so you know there was a whole
 
01:52:28.189 --> 01:52:28.199 align:start position:0%
spectrum of time where it it really
 
01:52:31.229 --> 01:52:31.239 align:start position:0%
wasn't clear um but anytime there's
 
01:52:33.430 --> 01:52:33.440 align:start position:0%
emergence of a new
 
01:52:36.470 --> 01:52:36.480 align:start position:0%
pathogen the Baseline recommendation for
 
01:52:40.189 --> 01:52:40.199 align:start position:0%
Health Care infection prevention is
 
01:52:44.069 --> 01:52:44.079 align:start position:0%
wearing an n95 mask even if even if
 
01:52:46.750 --> 01:52:46.760 align:start position:0%
there's not um clear evidence of airborn
 
01:52:50.229 --> 01:52:50.239 align:start position:0%
transmission with any new emerging
 
01:52:53.510 --> 01:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
infectious disease pathogen the Baseline
 
01:52:56.270 --> 01:52:56.280 align:start position:0%
um uh the Baseline PPE if you will
 
01:52:57.470 --> 01:52:57.480 align:start position:0%
personal protective equipment
 
01:52:59.950 --> 01:52:59.960 align:start position:0%
recommended in the healthc care setting
 
01:53:02.550 --> 01:53:02.560 align:start position:0%
are like n95 masks we we we saw that
 
01:53:04.629 --> 01:53:04.639 align:start position:0%
with um Aven influenza for example
 
01:53:07.229 --> 01:53:07.239 align:start position:0%
anybody that comes in with Aven
 
01:53:09.390 --> 01:53:09.400 align:start position:0%
influenza um even though it hasn't been
 
01:53:12.350 --> 01:53:12.360 align:start position:0%
shown you know the h5n1 virus uh even
 
01:53:13.470 --> 01:53:13.480 align:start position:0%
though it hasn't been shown to be
 
01:53:15.589 --> 01:53:15.599 align:start position:0%
transmitting person to person if
 
01:53:17.910 --> 01:53:17.920 align:start position:0%
somebody's exposed dairy cattle comes
 
01:53:19.430 --> 01:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
down with what they think is you know
 
01:53:22.069 --> 01:53:22.079 align:start position:0%
h5n1 influenza EV and influenza
 
01:53:22.990 --> 01:53:23.000 align:start position:0%
infection and they go into the
 
01:53:24.229 --> 01:53:24.239 align:start position:0%
Healthcare System those Healthcare
 
01:53:26.550 --> 01:53:26.560 align:start position:0%
Providers should be wearing n95 masks
 
01:53:28.149 --> 01:53:28.159 align:start position:0%
not because it's Airborne but because
 
01:53:29.310 --> 01:53:29.320 align:start position:0%
that's the sort of the standard
 
01:53:31.589 --> 01:53:31.599 align:start position:0%
operating procedure for dealing with a
 
01:53:33.109 --> 01:53:33.119 align:start position:0%
new infectious pathogen in the
 
01:53:34.669 --> 01:53:34.679 align:start position:0%
healthcare setting but that doesn't
 
01:53:37.709 --> 01:53:37.719 align:start position:0%
translate into the public setting until
 
01:53:41.990 --> 01:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
you know the evidence accumulated over a
 
01:53:47.229 --> 01:53:47.239 align:start position:0%
year or two thank you uh may I follow up
 
01:53:50.270 --> 01:53:50.280 align:start position:0%
um so uh you've mentioned that initial
 
01:53:51.950 --> 01:53:51.960 align:start position:0%
uh clinical trial data for the vaccine
 
01:53:54.870 --> 01:53:54.880 align:start position:0%
suggested a 95% rate of efficacy for
 
01:53:58.629 --> 01:53:58.639 align:start position:0%
preventing the contraction of uh of the
 
01:54:02.069 --> 01:54:02.079 align:start position:0%
virus has our understanding has DHHS
 
01:54:04.550 --> 01:54:04.560 align:start position:0%
understanding of that changed over time
 
01:54:07.550 --> 01:54:07.560 align:start position:0%
and if so when when when approximately
 
01:54:09.229 --> 01:54:09.239 align:start position:0%
did our understanding
 
01:54:12.750 --> 01:54:12.760 align:start position:0%
evolve so
 
01:54:16.189 --> 01:54:16.199 align:start position:0%
um the again the initial clinical trial
 
01:54:19.870 --> 01:54:19.880 align:start position:0%
data showed 95% Effectiveness for the
 
01:54:23.310 --> 01:54:23.320 align:start position:0%
MRNA vaccines at preventing infection
 
01:54:26.790 --> 01:54:26.800 align:start position:0%
as the virus evolved over
 
01:54:31.149 --> 01:54:31.159 align:start position:0%
time so over months it
 
01:54:34.870 --> 01:54:34.880 align:start position:0%
became clear that that protection didn't
 
01:54:38.430 --> 01:54:38.440 align:start position:0%
last meaning immunity waned or
 
01:54:40.550 --> 01:54:40.560 align:start position:0%
decreased um and there were a couple
 
01:54:43.350 --> 01:54:43.360 align:start position:0%
reasons for that one is just the passage
 
01:54:45.750 --> 01:54:45.760 align:start position:0%
of time so somebody's antibody levels
 
01:54:47.830 --> 01:54:47.840 align:start position:0%
decreasing over time the others that the
 
01:54:51.510 --> 01:54:51.520 align:start position:0%
virus evolved very quickly in fact um to
 
01:54:53.109 --> 01:54:53.119 align:start position:0%
different variants
 
01:54:54.669 --> 01:54:54.679 align:start position:0%
and so the combination of those two
 
01:54:54.679 --> 01:54:56.669 align:start position:0%
and so the combination of those two
things

01:54:56.669 --> 01:54:56.679 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:55:01.149 --> 01:55:01.159 align:start position:0%
um the LED to studies
 
01:55:01.159 --> 01:55:03.510 align:start position:0%
um the LED to studies
emerging

01:55:03.510 --> 01:55:03.520 align:start position:0%
emerging
 
01:55:05.350 --> 01:55:05.360 align:start position:0%
um I would
 
01:55:09.709 --> 01:55:09.719 align:start position:0%
say but by the middle by the middle to
 
01:55:11.350 --> 01:55:11.360 align:start position:0%
end of
 
01:55:15.910 --> 01:55:15.920 align:start position:0%
2021 it was becoming more clear that
 
01:55:19.030 --> 01:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
protection was not lasting either
 
01:55:20.510 --> 01:55:20.520 align:start position:0%
because of time or because the emerging
 
01:55:23.990 --> 01:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
of variance um
 
01:55:26.430 --> 01:55:26.440 align:start position:0%
and so that's when I'm trying to I'm
 
01:55:27.750 --> 01:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
pausing as I'm trying to think back
 
01:55:29.430 --> 01:55:29.440 align:start position:0%
TimeWise that's when we had the Delta
 
01:55:32.350 --> 01:55:32.360 align:start position:0%
variant emerging and then the year after
 
01:55:34.950 --> 01:55:34.960 align:start position:0%
that we had Omron so it was probably
 
01:55:37.750 --> 01:55:37.760 align:start position:0%
around emergence as these new variants
 
01:55:39.030 --> 01:55:39.040 align:start position:0%
emerged over the summer and into the
 
01:55:40.510 --> 01:55:40.520 align:start position:0%
fall and the winter you had the beta
 
01:55:43.229 --> 01:55:43.239 align:start position:0%
variant then you had the Delta variant
 
01:55:45.430 --> 01:55:45.440 align:start position:0%
um and so it became clear that the
 
01:55:47.709 --> 01:55:47.719 align:start position:0%
vaccine immunity wasn't lasting and and
 
01:55:49.750 --> 01:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
initially we thought that that was due
 
01:55:52.470 --> 01:55:52.480 align:start position:0%
to the rapid change the rapid change in
 
01:55:54.550 --> 01:55:54.560 align:start position:0%
the virus and the mutations of the virus
 
01:55:56.950 --> 01:55:56.960 align:start position:0%
um that allowed the antibodies
 
01:55:59.430 --> 01:55:59.440 align:start position:0%
protection not to work as well but I
 
01:56:01.790 --> 01:56:01.800 align:start position:0%
think it became apparent that it was
 
01:56:04.270 --> 01:56:04.280 align:start position:0%
also just duration from vaccination that
 
01:56:06.229 --> 01:56:06.239 align:start position:0%
led to a decline in immunity as people
 
01:56:07.910 --> 01:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
studied like the antibody response and
 
01:56:10.589 --> 01:56:10.599 align:start position:0%
saw waning antibody response over time
 
01:56:12.629 --> 01:56:12.639 align:start position:0%
but that that was data that emerged
 
01:56:12.639 --> 01:56:14.669 align:start position:0%
but that that was data that emerged
through

01:56:14.669 --> 01:56:14.679 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:56:19.470 --> 01:56:19.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:22.790 --> 01:56:22.800 align:start position:0%
20122 last one sure actually well
 
01:56:25.550 --> 01:56:25.560 align:start position:0%
this is uh this is me rubbing the lamp
 
01:56:27.390 --> 01:56:27.400 align:start position:0%
getting the genie Third Wish asking for
 
01:56:31.709 --> 01:56:31.719 align:start position:0%
more wishes but um I want to ask because
 
01:56:33.709 --> 01:56:33.719 align:start position:0%
there are a lot more questions not
 
01:56:35.270 --> 01:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
terribly complicated ones but we just
 
01:56:36.550 --> 01:56:36.560 align:start position:0%
don't have time to get to all of them
 
01:56:37.830 --> 01:56:37.840 align:start position:0%
right now would it be possible to
 
01:56:39.589 --> 01:56:39.599 align:start position:0%
forward to you so either you or your
 
01:56:41.790 --> 01:56:41.800 align:start position:0%
staff could provide us just you know in
 
01:56:44.709 --> 01:56:44.719 align:start position:0%
writing or verbally answers to a number
 
01:56:46.629 --> 01:56:46.639 align:start position:0%
of other fairly simple questions along
 
01:56:48.589 --> 01:56:48.599 align:start position:0%
the same lines as we've been asking so
 
01:56:52.510 --> 01:56:52.520 align:start position:0%
far I I mean sure I don't you're I I
 
01:56:55.790 --> 01:56:55.800 align:start position:0%
think you have aby's contact information
 
01:57:00.790 --> 01:57:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:03.910 --> 01:57:03.920 align:start position:0%
getting yeah that would be great thank
 
01:57:08.390 --> 01:57:08.400 align:start position:0%
you uh does anyone else no well Dr Chan
 
01:57:11.510 --> 01:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
I know that you are pressed for time and
 
01:57:13.350 --> 01:57:13.360 align:start position:0%
um I just want to thank you so much for
 
01:57:14.990 --> 01:57:15.000 align:start position:0%
being here it's really important for us
 
01:57:17.750 --> 01:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
to understand what we got right what we
 
01:57:20.950 --> 01:57:20.960 align:start position:0%
got wrong we know that every pandemic is
 
01:57:23.350 --> 01:57:23.360 align:start position:0%
going to be different
 
01:57:27.390 --> 01:57:27.400 align:start position:0%
um no two things are ever the same so
 
01:57:29.550 --> 01:57:29.560 align:start position:0%
but if we can learn anything from this
 
01:57:31.669 --> 01:57:31.679 align:start position:0%
pandemic uh what we got right what we
 
01:57:33.870 --> 01:57:33.880 align:start position:0%
got wrong um that is really what the
 
01:57:36.350 --> 01:57:36.360 align:start position:0%
goal is so that the next time this
 
01:57:39.669 --> 01:57:39.679 align:start position:0%
happens is we have something we can look
 
01:57:44.109 --> 01:57:44.119 align:start position:0%
at um so I appreciate uh you being here
 
01:57:47.629 --> 01:57:47.639 align:start position:0%
and uh helping us through this my
 
01:57:48.950 --> 01:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
pleasure thank you thank you for your
 
01:57:50.350 --> 01:57:50.360 align:start position:0%
time and your attention I appreciate it
 
01:57:55.669 --> 01:57:55.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:58.990 --> 01:57:59.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:02.350 --> 01:58:02.360 align:start position:0%
afternoon anybody after not right now no
 
01:58:03.790 --> 01:58:03.800 align:start position:0%
you're we're
 
01:58:05.990 --> 01:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
it thank
 
01:58:09.910 --> 01:58:09.920 align:start position:0%
you uh would everyone like to take a uh
 
01:58:13.069 --> 01:58:13.079 align:start position:0%
10 minute
 
01:58:18.069 --> 01:58:18.079 align:start position:0%
recess okay so we'll be back here at
 
01:58:20.149 --> 01:58:20.159 align:start position:0%
11:05 no
 
01:58:23.950 --> 01:58:23.960 align:start position:0%
1110 no right
 
01:58:25.470 --> 01:58:25.480 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at two different clocks on
 
01:58:35.669 --> 01:58:35.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:37.430 --> 01:58:37.440 align:start position:0%

02:10:45.510 --> 02:10:45.520 align:start position:0%
time being 11:10 I'm going to pull this
 
02:10:51.350 --> 02:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
out of recess um so uh Dr Chan just
 
02:10:52.990 --> 02:10:53.000 align:start position:0%
testified in front of our committee for
 
02:10:55.229 --> 02:10:55.239 align:start position:0%
2 hours if anyone has any more questions
 
02:10:57.149 --> 02:10:57.159 align:start position:0%
that they would like to submit to him
 
02:10:59.069 --> 02:10:59.079 align:start position:0%
please email me and I will forward that
 
02:11:02.510 --> 02:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
on to Abby his uh the legislative liais
 
02:11:04.830 --> 02:11:04.840 align:start position:0%
on um and we will try and get those
 
02:11:09.709 --> 02:11:09.719 align:start position:0%
answered uh in a timely manner so
 
02:11:12.310 --> 02:11:12.320 align:start position:0%
um yeah if you could probably get them
 
02:11:14.950 --> 02:11:14.960 align:start position:0%
done today uh that way we could get them
 
02:11:16.870 --> 02:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
in time for next week's meeting if we
 
02:11:18.149 --> 02:11:18.159 align:start position:0%
need to go over
 
02:11:21.589 --> 02:11:21.599 align:start position:0%
anything okay anyone want to have a
 
02:11:23.830 --> 02:11:23.840 align:start position:0%
discussion about the testimony we just
 
02:11:23.840 --> 02:11:30.430 align:start position:0%
discussion about the testimony we just
heard

02:11:30.430 --> 02:11:30.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:33.430 --> 02:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
02:11:35.430 --> 02:11:35.440 align:start position:0%
beler thank you madam chair I just want
 
02:11:37.750 --> 02:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
to say um I think that was that was very
 
02:11:38.790 --> 02:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
useful the only thing I would have
 
02:11:40.589 --> 02:11:40.599 align:start position:0%
wished for is a bit more time because
 
02:11:43.510 --> 02:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
there's so many more sort of detailed
 
02:11:46.470 --> 02:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
easy you know easy yes or no or timeline
 
02:11:48.870 --> 02:11:48.880 align:start position:0%
questions to kind of resolve to help
 
02:11:51.830 --> 02:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
really get the picture um
 
02:11:55.069 --> 02:11:55.079 align:start position:0%
but I think that was very useful on the
 
02:11:59.069 --> 02:11:59.079 align:start position:0%
whole um we do have a report that will
 
02:12:01.870 --> 02:12:01.880 align:start position:0%
um assume I'm should be done uh for
 
02:12:01.880 --> 02:12:03.149 align:start position:0%
um assume I'm should be done uh for
November

02:12:03.149 --> 02:12:03.159 align:start position:0%
November
 
02:12:05.750 --> 02:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
1st um
 
02:12:05.760 --> 02:12:08.750 align:start position:0%
1st um
and

02:12:08.750 --> 02:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:12:11.589 --> 02:12:11.599 align:start position:0%
uh you know we need to really focus on
 
02:12:11.599 --> 02:12:12.390 align:start position:0%
uh you know we need to really focus on
the

02:12:12.390 --> 02:12:12.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:12:15.229 --> 02:12:15.239 align:start position:0%
positives um and also what we can
 
02:12:17.629 --> 02:12:17.639 align:start position:0%
improve on uh that happened during the
 
02:12:20.629 --> 02:12:20.639 align:start position:0%
pandemic um and again some of the
 
02:12:20.639 --> 02:12:22.189 align:start position:0%
pandemic um and again some of the
takeaways

02:12:22.189 --> 02:12:22.199 align:start position:0%
takeaways
 
02:12:25.030 --> 02:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
uh that we have heard in front of this
 
02:12:30.990 --> 02:12:31.000 align:start position:0%
committee over time is um you know how
 
02:12:34.549 --> 02:12:34.559 align:start position:0%
do we eliminate uh so much fear in a
 
02:12:38.109 --> 02:12:38.119 align:start position:0%
pandemic um because uh not only does and
 
02:12:39.629 --> 02:12:39.639 align:start position:0%
a lot of that came from the federal
 
02:12:42.350 --> 02:12:42.360 align:start position:0%
government and how can the
 
02:12:45.830 --> 02:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
state um
 
02:12:48.870 --> 02:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
counter act I guess
 
02:12:54.149 --> 02:12:54.159 align:start position:0%
uh step in and and help eliminate that
 
02:12:54.159 --> 02:12:55.950 align:start position:0%
uh step in and and help eliminate that
um

02:12:55.950 --> 02:12:55.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:59.390 --> 02:12:59.400 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't help anyone's uh it
 
02:13:01.149 --> 02:13:01.159 align:start position:0%
it actually has an adverse Health effect
 
02:13:02.950 --> 02:13:02.960 align:start position:0%
on people
 
02:13:06.589 --> 02:13:06.599 align:start position:0%
um when they're afraid to do anything uh
 
02:13:10.189 --> 02:13:10.199 align:start position:0%
so um I'd like to make sure we have a
 
02:13:12.790 --> 02:13:12.800 align:start position:0%
section on that uh in the
 
02:13:15.149 --> 02:13:15.159 align:start position:0%
report um you know we heard from
 
02:13:16.589 --> 02:13:16.599 align:start position:0%
commissioner edelblute how he tried to
 
02:13:19.069 --> 02:13:19.079 align:start position:0%
stay positive and say you know we can
 
02:13:20.430 --> 02:13:20.440 align:start position:0%
get through this you know we've done
 
02:13:21.669 --> 02:13:21.679 align:start position:0%
this before
 
02:13:22.990 --> 02:13:23.000 align:start position:0%
you know the country's been through
 
02:13:25.629 --> 02:13:25.639 align:start position:0%
things you know let's stick together
 
02:13:28.390 --> 02:13:28.400 align:start position:0%
move forward um you know trying to get
 
02:13:31.390 --> 02:13:31.400 align:start position:0%
out that positive messaging and I think
 
02:13:34.669 --> 02:13:34.679 align:start position:0%
um although it was a very scary time for
 
02:13:39.069 --> 02:13:39.079 align:start position:0%
everyone here in the state um and the
 
02:13:40.870 --> 02:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
unknown you know it's always you're
 
02:13:43.149 --> 02:13:43.159 align:start position:0%
always fearful of the
 
02:13:45.510 --> 02:13:45.520 align:start position:0%
unknown but how do
 
02:13:48.790 --> 02:13:48.800 align:start position:0%
we keep everyone moving forward in and
 
02:13:52.830 --> 02:13:52.840 align:start position:0%
and in a positive light um we've learned
 
02:13:56.030 --> 02:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
a lot about uh uh the schools you know
 
02:13:58.870 --> 02:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
the air filtration the ventilation um I
 
02:14:01.990 --> 02:14:02.000 align:start position:0%
think uh and you know in in hearing our
 
02:14:04.270 --> 02:14:04.280 align:start position:0%
testimony and learning about the school
 
02:14:06.950 --> 02:14:06.960 align:start position:0%
in New York that never shut down because
 
02:14:09.510 --> 02:14:09.520 align:start position:0%
uh they were nervous because of it was
 
02:14:13.069 --> 02:14:13.079 align:start position:0%
an children with autism uh what kind of
 
02:14:16.549 --> 02:14:16.559 align:start position:0%
damage that would do and how they uh
 
02:14:19.990 --> 02:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
hired an industrial hygienist uh and he
 
02:14:22.229 --> 02:14:22.239 align:start position:0%
went in and out fited that
 
02:14:25.629 --> 02:14:25.639 align:start position:0%
school um and there were no outbreaks of
 
02:14:29.669 --> 02:14:29.679 align:start position:0%
covid um in that school so you know
 
02:14:32.390 --> 02:14:32.400 align:start position:0%
there's things to be learned there's
 
02:14:34.709 --> 02:14:34.719 align:start position:0%
things that I think even in an upcoming
 
02:14:37.470 --> 02:14:37.480 align:start position:0%
pandemic that if we start implementing
 
02:14:40.790 --> 02:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
and make sure they're done properly now
 
02:14:42.350 --> 02:14:42.360 align:start position:0%
uh can help mitigate some of the
 
02:14:44.229 --> 02:14:44.239 align:start position:0%
solutions and we also have to understand
 
02:14:47.750 --> 02:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
that no Pand to pandemics are the same
 
02:14:49.870 --> 02:14:49.880 align:start position:0%
every virus is different and will react
 
02:14:52.030 --> 02:14:52.040 align:start position:0%
differently um and they will attack
 
02:14:55.270 --> 02:14:55.280 align:start position:0%
different populations we know that Co
 
02:14:59.470 --> 02:14:59.480 align:start position:0%
really went after the elderly we had a
 
02:15:02.790 --> 02:15:02.800 align:start position:0%
um it really you know the nursing home
 
02:15:06.830 --> 02:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
population was devastated in our state
 
02:15:09.910 --> 02:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
um but we I think we also learned that
 
02:15:13.069 --> 02:15:13.079 align:start position:0%
leaving people alone and uh isolating
 
02:15:16.109 --> 02:15:16.119 align:start position:0%
them is not also a good policy and how
 
02:15:18.430 --> 02:15:18.440 align:start position:0%
do we mitigate that going forward and
 
02:15:20.030 --> 02:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
what precautions can we take so that
 
02:15:21.709 --> 02:15:21.719 align:start position:0%
people aren't alone
 
02:15:23.790 --> 02:15:23.800 align:start position:0%
um when they're when they're you know
 
02:15:25.069 --> 02:15:25.079 align:start position:0%
when they're dying and their loved ones
 
02:15:27.990 --> 02:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
can't get to see them um you know
 
02:15:30.549 --> 02:15:30.559 align:start position:0%
because these have uh long lasting
 
02:15:33.510 --> 02:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
mental health effects so and I think Dr
 
02:15:35.189 --> 02:15:35.199 align:start position:0%
Chan got it right you know it's a
 
02:15:37.830 --> 02:15:37.840 align:start position:0%
balancing act we're we're in a pandemic
 
02:15:39.069 --> 02:15:39.079 align:start position:0%
we're trying to you're trying to deal
 
02:15:40.790 --> 02:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
with public health policy but you're
 
02:15:43.629 --> 02:15:43.639 align:start position:0%
also trying to look at everything else
 
02:15:46.350 --> 02:15:46.360 align:start position:0%
and you know New Hampshire did take a a
 
02:15:49.109 --> 02:15:49.119 align:start position:0%
good did pretty well I in The Balancing
 
02:15:51.270 --> 02:15:51.280 align:start position:0%
Act and I think through some of Our
 
02:15:53.830 --> 02:15:53.840 align:start position:0%
Testimony we learned uh we did a lot of
 
02:15:55.109 --> 02:15:55.119 align:start position:0%
things right but I think there's some
 
02:15:57.310 --> 02:15:57.320 align:start position:0%
things we can do different uh going
 
02:15:59.430 --> 02:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
forward and Dr Chan touched upon it
 
02:16:02.229 --> 02:16:02.239 align:start position:0%
messaging is big and I think that's
 
02:16:03.910 --> 02:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
something that we really need to stress
 
02:16:07.350 --> 02:16:07.360 align:start position:0%
in our report is how messaging is done
 
02:16:08.870 --> 02:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
so does anyone else have anything they'd
 
02:16:11.229 --> 02:16:11.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:13.229 --> 02:16:13.239 align:start position:0%
say representative
 
02:16:15.870 --> 02:16:15.880 align:start position:0%
Gro thank you I think one of the the
 
02:16:17.830 --> 02:16:17.840 align:start position:0%
components that he talked about were
 
02:16:21.069 --> 02:16:21.079 align:start position:0%
communication health care workers the
 
02:16:23.390 --> 02:16:23.400 align:start position:0%
supporting that
 
02:16:25.950 --> 02:16:25.960 align:start position:0%
community and um I think those are the
 
02:16:29.990 --> 02:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
two things that he said we could so if
 
02:16:34.270 --> 02:16:34.280 align:start position:0%
um in our work as legislators we look at
 
02:16:39.870 --> 02:16:39.880 align:start position:0%
ways to promote Health Care as a
 
02:16:41.790 --> 02:16:41.800 align:start position:0%
profession because there are many
 
02:16:43.750 --> 02:16:43.760 align:start position:0%
different levels of health care right
 
02:16:44.790 --> 02:16:44.800 align:start position:0%
you don't have
 
02:16:49.910 --> 02:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
to necessarily be a physician you can be
 
02:16:52.270 --> 02:16:52.280 align:start position:0%
a nurse you can be an LNA you can be an
 
02:16:55.549 --> 02:16:55.559 align:start position:0%
LPN I mean there's many professions and
 
02:16:58.469 --> 02:16:58.479 align:start position:0%
I know that um it's an area that I've
 
02:17:00.750 --> 02:17:00.760 align:start position:0%
been focusing on and I will continue to
 
02:17:03.830 --> 02:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
focus on because I think that um there's
 
02:17:06.190 --> 02:17:06.200 align:start position:0%
a lot of emphasis on the trades right
 
02:17:08.830 --> 02:17:08.840 align:start position:0%
now which is important but but nursing
 
02:17:10.629 --> 02:17:10.639 align:start position:0%
is a trade
 
02:17:13.230 --> 02:17:13.240 align:start position:0%
too representa grer I absolutely agree
 
02:17:14.790 --> 02:17:14.800 align:start position:0%
with you and when we think about health
 
02:17:16.270 --> 02:17:16.280 align:start position:0%
care we're not we're not just thinking
 
02:17:20.150 --> 02:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
about uh lnas or RNs it's a whole
 
02:17:20.160 --> 02:17:21.349 align:start position:0%
about uh lnas or RNs it's a whole
administrative

02:17:21.349 --> 02:17:21.359 align:start position:0%
administrative
 
02:17:26.070 --> 02:17:26.080 align:start position:0%
uh Staffing so it's it's not just one um
 
02:17:28.389 --> 02:17:28.399 align:start position:0%
but you know we did pull in uh we had
 
02:17:30.469 --> 02:17:30.479 align:start position:0%
our National Guard uh that we pulled in
 
02:17:34.469 --> 02:17:34.479 align:start position:0%
to help with this also uh as a resource
 
02:17:39.629 --> 02:17:39.639 align:start position:0%
um you know so we we we have resources
 
02:17:44.150 --> 02:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
we can pull on um but we also lost a lot
 
02:17:47.469 --> 02:17:47.479 align:start position:0%
of healthcare workers due to mandates so
 
02:17:50.070 --> 02:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
we have to recognize again there's The
 
02:17:51.709 --> 02:17:51.719 align:start position:0%
Balancing Act
 
02:17:53.750 --> 02:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
um that has to go
 
02:17:53.760 --> 02:18:01.110 align:start position:0%
um that has to go
on

02:18:01.110 --> 02:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:04.190 --> 02:18:04.200 align:start position:0%
so if uh no one else has anything they
 
02:18:06.110 --> 02:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
would like to discuss uh our next
 
02:18:07.990 --> 02:18:08.000 align:start position:0%

02:18:27.429 --> 02:18:27.439 align:start position:0%
