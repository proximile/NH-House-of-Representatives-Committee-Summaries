right okay welcome welcome everyone uh
 
00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:33.000 align:start position:0%
my name is John janigian I'm the chair
 
00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:35.560 align:start position:0%
of ways and means and uh looks like
 
00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:36.880 align:start position:0%
we've got a pretty good attendance we
 
00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
might be missing a couple of people but
 
00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:43.160 align:start position:0%
um I think we should get started um so I
 
00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:44.920 align:start position:0%
want to First just uh welcome you to the
 
00:12:47.629 --> 00:12:47.639 align:start position:0%
ways and means uh committee uh some of
 
00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:49.240 align:start position:0%
you obviously are returning members some
 
00:12:51.829 --> 00:12:51.839 align:start position:0%
of you are brand new uh some of you have

legislature so um
 
00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
probably the best thing to start off
 
00:13:03.509 --> 00:13:03.519 align:start position:0%
with is go around the room and have each
 
00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:07.040 align:start position:0%

00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:49.360 align:start position:0%
role of this committee is is basically
 
00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:54.120 align:start position:0%
um twofold um Revenue generating Revenue
 
00:33:57.789 --> 00:33:57.799 align:start position:0%
estimates um that finance will then use
 
00:33:59.789 --> 00:33:59.799 align:start position:0%
to determine how much can the state
 
00:34:03.310 --> 00:34:03.320 align:start position:0%
spend over the next bium and uh we will
 
00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
spend a good part of our
 
00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:10.200 align:start position:0%
next probably five to six weeks figuring
 
00:34:12.829 --> 00:34:12.839 align:start position:0%
out what do we think the revenues are
 
00:34:14.990 --> 00:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
going to be coming into the state over
 
00:34:17.790 --> 00:34:17.800 align:start position:0%
the next year and over the next actually
 
00:34:20.669 --> 00:34:20.679 align:start position:0%
two years and uh there will be updates
 
00:34:22.950 --> 00:34:22.960 align:start position:0%
from time to time but we've got to have
 
00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
our best guesstimate um due by I believe
 
00:34:29.149 --> 00:34:29.159 align:start position:0%
it's around February 15th
 
00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:32.520 align:start position:0%
um we may have some I know Finance uh
 
00:34:35.829 --> 00:34:35.839 align:start position:0%
the chair of Finance uh would like to
 
00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:39.200 align:start position:0%
know something sooner um and uh because
 
00:34:40.669 --> 00:34:40.679 align:start position:0%
they have to they're the ones that
 
00:34:41.950 --> 00:34:41.960 align:start position:0%
figure out how to spend the money we the
 
00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:44.320 align:start position:0%
ones that say how much they have to
 
00:34:47.470 --> 00:34:47.480 align:start position:0%
spend so it's it's an important job that
 
00:34:49.510 --> 00:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
obviously we need to take seriously and
 
00:34:52.030 --> 00:34:52.040 align:start position:0%
uh figure out so what we'll be doing is
 
00:34:55.550 --> 00:34:55.560 align:start position:0%
we'll be hearing from uh committees like
 
00:34:57.470 --> 00:34:57.480 align:start position:0%
well actually next uh next week we'll be
 
00:34:59.670 --> 00:34:59.680 align:start position:0%
me meeting on the 13th and the 14th
 
00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:02.720 align:start position:0%
primarily to hear from different state
 
00:35:06.030 --> 00:35:06.040 align:start position:0%
organizations like Department of Revenue
 
00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:08.280 align:start position:0%
um and and the different departments as
 
00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:10.160 align:start position:0%
to not necessarily what they're
 
00:35:12.270 --> 00:35:12.280 align:start position:0%
expecting for money yet but so that
 
00:35:14.950 --> 00:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
people understand what is it they do and
 
00:35:17.589 --> 00:35:17.599 align:start position:0%
for example with Dr there's um they'll
 
00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
go over the Myriad of taxes that they
 
00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:22.880 align:start position:0%
create uh collect and what are they and
 
00:35:24.990 --> 00:35:25.000 align:start position:0%
when they're collected and so forth next
 
00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:27.200 align:start position:0%
time we have to use Dr as an example
 
00:35:29.230 --> 00:35:29.240 align:start position:0%
next time we have them back it'll be to
 
00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
say what are your what does it look like
 
00:35:34.870 --> 00:35:34.880 align:start position:0%
what uh how have we been hitting
 
00:35:36.550 --> 00:35:36.560 align:start position:0%
expectations have we been missing
 
00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:39.240 align:start position:0%
expectations if so by how much and what
 
00:35:43.109 --> 00:35:43.119 align:start position:0%
do you see happening um in the coming uh
 
00:35:46.750 --> 00:35:46.760 align:start position:0%
year and and by any them uh the other
 
00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:48.760 align:start position:0%
important thing that we do obviously is
 
00:35:51.589 --> 00:35:51.599 align:start position:0%
is uh look at the bills that come to our
 
00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:54.160 align:start position:0%
committee and I looked last night so far
 
00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
we have five bills in the committee I
 
00:35:59.829 --> 00:35:59.839 align:start position:0%
expect a lot more uh will come in uh so
 
00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:02.640 align:start position:0%
any bills dealing with
 
00:36:06.910 --> 00:36:06.920 align:start position:0%
um tax uh related uh issues like
 
00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:09.400 align:start position:0%
increase of tax decrease of tax remove
 
00:36:12.910 --> 00:36:12.920 align:start position:0%
ATT tax uh fee related anything that's
 
00:36:15.430 --> 00:36:15.440 align:start position:0%
affecting the the money coming into the
 
00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:17.440 align:start position:0%
state is a bill that presumably would
 
00:36:20.430 --> 00:36:20.440 align:start position:0%
come here first we will get a couple of
 
00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
second committee bills where it's been
 
00:36:26.069 --> 00:36:26.079 align:start position:0%
uh you know the the
 
00:36:30.109 --> 00:36:30.119 align:start position:0%
policy uh I'll give you an example
 
00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:33.640 align:start position:0%
um one that one that obviously comes to
 
00:36:37.309 --> 00:36:37.319 align:start position:0%
mind is the um is marijuana bills
 
00:36:41.309 --> 00:36:41.319 align:start position:0%
policy-wise they go to um wherever they
 
00:36:43.030 --> 00:36:43.040 align:start position:0%
go to probably Health and Human Services
 
00:36:44.990 --> 00:36:45.000 align:start position:0%
I guess or or one of those committees
 
00:36:49.270 --> 00:36:49.280 align:start position:0%
first um and then if it passes out of
 
00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
that committee it passes out of the
 
00:36:53.390 --> 00:36:53.400 align:start position:0%
house it could come to us because maybe
 
00:36:55.270 --> 00:36:55.280 align:start position:0%
there's some sort of expenditure in it
 
00:36:58.510 --> 00:36:58.520 align:start position:0%
or tax or something um or not
 
00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:02.240 align:start position:0%
expenditure I should say tax or fee um
 
00:37:03.829 --> 00:37:03.839 align:start position:0%
then it would come to our committee to
 
00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:05.800 align:start position:0%
discuss um we don't have that many
 
00:37:07.309 --> 00:37:07.319 align:start position:0%
second committee bills most of them will
 
00:37:10.030 --> 00:37:10.040 align:start position:0%
be first committee
 
00:37:12.670 --> 00:37:12.680 align:start position:0%
bills um any any questions uh I don't
 
00:37:14.510 --> 00:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
want to go through this whole thing and
 
00:37:16.270 --> 00:37:16.280 align:start position:0%
not have qu if people have questions
 
00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:18.240 align:start position:0%
feel free to raise your hand I'll call
 
00:37:21.430 --> 00:37:21.440 align:start position:0%
on you um a lot of you for the new
 
00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:23.440 align:start position:0%
people the the I think you already have
 
00:37:24.910 --> 00:37:24.920 align:start position:0%
a sense of how it works but if you have
 
00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:28.200 align:start position:0%
a question you would raise your hand
 
00:37:31.150 --> 00:37:31.160 align:start position:0%
I once I recognize you you can speak um
 
00:37:33.589 --> 00:37:33.599 align:start position:0%
if you have a follow-up question you
 
00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
would I mean this this is a little less
 
00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
formal right now because it's kind of an
 
00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:39.040 align:start position:0%
orientation but typically once we get
 
00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:41.560 align:start position:0%
into our regular meetings uh if you have
 
00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
a follow-up question you'd have to be
 
00:37:44.750 --> 00:37:44.760 align:start position:0%
recognized for the follow-up question as
 
00:37:48.030 --> 00:37:48.040 align:start position:0%
well um but anyways any questions so far
 
00:37:49.990 --> 00:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
on what I've what I've
 
00:37:52.430 --> 00:37:52.440 align:start position:0%
covered okay good glad everything's
 
00:37:55.630 --> 00:37:55.640 align:start position:0%
Crystal Clear um but don't hesitate if
 
00:37:57.589 --> 00:37:57.599 align:start position:0%
uh you have any questions so those are
 
00:38:00.030 --> 00:38:00.040 align:start position:0%
the main main goals uh of of this
 
00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:03.680 align:start position:0%
committee um for those of you uh who
 
00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
don't know if you go on to the State
 
00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.510 align:start position:0%
don't know if you go on to the State
website

00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
website
 
00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
um well I guess you can go on the State
 
00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:14.640 align:start position:0%
website and navigate yourself into the
 
00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:16.720 align:start position:0%
legislature into the house and
 
00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
specifically you can look at committees
 
00:38:21.589 --> 00:38:21.599 align:start position:0%
and then go to Ways and Means and see
 
00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:30.640 align:start position:0%
so when we do work on on
 
00:38:33.430 --> 00:38:33.440 align:start position:0%
bills um
 
00:38:36.510 --> 00:38:36.520 align:start position:0%
basically we will start with the fir the
 
00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
first step will be to have I'll schedule
 
00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
public hearings on on bills and public
 
00:38:45.109 --> 00:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
hearings at the public hearings we'll
 
00:38:49.589 --> 00:38:49.599 align:start position:0%
have typically the public can will come
 
00:38:51.910 --> 00:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
and if somebody wants to speak we have
 
00:38:53.390 --> 00:38:53.400 align:start position:0%
things called pink cards there'll be
 
00:38:55.349 --> 00:38:55.359 align:start position:0%
pink cards that people fill out with
 
00:38:57.670 --> 00:38:57.680 align:start position:0%
their name and um you know how long
 
00:38:59.109 --> 00:38:59.119 align:start position:0%
they're going to speak whether they're
 
00:39:01.589 --> 00:39:01.599 align:start position:0%
for or against the bill and then we'll
 
00:39:03.150 --> 00:39:03.160 align:start position:0%
hear from them they'll typically sit in
 
00:39:07.790 --> 00:39:07.800 align:start position:0%
this seat uh directly in in front of me
 
00:39:11.470 --> 00:39:11.480 align:start position:0%
um and um we after they give their
 
00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:13.200 align:start position:0%
initial testimony we as a committee can
 
00:39:15.270 --> 00:39:15.280 align:start position:0%
ask them questions and you know
 
00:39:16.990 --> 00:39:17.000 align:start position:0%
obviously I'll I'll recognize you raise
 
00:39:18.349 --> 00:39:18.359 align:start position:0%
your hand I'll recognize you you can ask
 
00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:21.240 align:start position:0%
a question um one thing that we don't do
 
00:39:23.190 --> 00:39:23.200 align:start position:0%
that I notice happens at the federal
 
00:39:25.829 --> 00:39:25.839 align:start position:0%
level is we don't put people on the hot
 
00:39:27.790 --> 00:39:27.800 align:start position:0%
seat and Grill them and them how
 
00:39:29.230 --> 00:39:29.240 align:start position:0%
terrible they are
 
00:39:34.589 --> 00:39:34.599 align:start position:0%
and and uh the uh the decorum uh in the
 
00:39:36.550 --> 00:39:36.560 align:start position:0%
house and in the house committees is to
 
00:39:38.950 --> 00:39:38.960 align:start position:0%
treat uh people with respect if you
 
00:39:41.790 --> 00:39:41.800 align:start position:0%
totally disagree with a person you don't
 
00:39:44.829 --> 00:39:44.839 align:start position:0%
you don't express that um our main thing
 
00:39:46.829 --> 00:39:46.839 align:start position:0%
is to understand why are they for or
 
00:39:48.430 --> 00:39:48.440 align:start position:0%
against the bill you know so we're
 
00:39:50.069 --> 00:39:50.079 align:start position:0%
questioning them we're hearing their
 
00:39:52.190 --> 00:39:52.200 align:start position:0%
answers um we can certainly ask a
 
00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:53.640 align:start position:0%
followup if we don't understand their
 
00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
answer but we don't put them on the hot
 
00:39:58.550 --> 00:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
seat and tell them how they're wrong or
 
00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
or you know in that regard
 
00:40:06.750 --> 00:40:06.760 align:start position:0%
um typically uh some bills there there
 
00:40:08.349 --> 00:40:08.359 align:start position:0%
may be they may just be introduced there
 
00:40:10.910 --> 00:40:10.920 align:start position:0%
may be one speaker and and they're done
 
00:40:12.790 --> 00:40:12.800 align:start position:0%
uh other bills that are more
 
00:40:15.430 --> 00:40:15.440 align:start position:0%
controversial um there may be situations
 
00:40:17.829 --> 00:40:17.839 align:start position:0%
where we have 15 people that want to
 
00:40:20.109 --> 00:40:20.119 align:start position:0%
speak and
 
00:40:23.309 --> 00:40:23.319 align:start position:0%
um typically you know again on the pink
 
00:40:25.430 --> 00:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
card they have to put down how long they
 
00:40:27.470 --> 00:40:27.480 align:start position:0%
think they're going to speak and I'll
 
00:40:29.710 --> 00:40:29.720 align:start position:0%
have those pin cards before I call on
 
00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
people so I'll be able to say okay this
 
00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:33.680 align:start position:0%
person wants to speak for 2 minutes okay
 
00:40:35.270 --> 00:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
they're four minutes in and it doesn't
 
00:40:37.349 --> 00:40:37.359 align:start position:0%
look like they're going to end you know
 
00:40:39.109 --> 00:40:39.119 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll most likely interrupt them and
 
00:40:40.990 --> 00:40:41.000 align:start position:0%
say okay you put two minutes can you
 
00:40:44.589 --> 00:40:44.599 align:start position:0%
please finish up um and uh you know I
 
00:40:46.829 --> 00:40:46.839 align:start position:0%
guess the the only other case would be
 
00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
people are sticking to their time frames
 
00:40:52.069 --> 00:40:52.079 align:start position:0%
but then we have more people that want
 
00:40:54.510 --> 00:40:54.520 align:start position:0%
to speak I might have to put a time
 
00:40:56.510 --> 00:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
limit on usually try not to do that
 
00:40:58.069 --> 00:40:58.079 align:start position:0%
because we want to hear what people have
 
00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:01.640 align:start position:0%
to say um if
 
00:41:04.750 --> 00:41:04.760 align:start position:0%
if the person is repeating themselves or
 
00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:06.800 align:start position:0%
questions being asked seem like
 
00:41:08.470 --> 00:41:08.480 align:start position:0%
repetitive and we're getting the same
 
00:41:10.870 --> 00:41:10.880 align:start position:0%
answers you know I may say okay I think
 
00:41:12.790 --> 00:41:12.800 align:start position:0%
you know we have the answer to that um
 
00:41:15.470 --> 00:41:15.480 align:start position:0%
and so forth yes representative ORS
 
00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so my question is are
 
00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:20.680 align:start position:0%
we going to pre-amp the pink cards with
 
00:41:22.710 --> 00:41:22.720 align:start position:0%
a three minute time
 
00:41:25.790 --> 00:41:25.800 align:start position:0%
stamp that was a joke
 
00:41:29.270 --> 00:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
okay well in other words it may be that
 
00:41:31.870 --> 00:41:31.880 align:start position:0%
may have been a joke but if no we don't
 
00:41:35.069 --> 00:41:35.079 align:start position:0%
pre-amp anything however if there's tons
 
00:41:37.309 --> 00:41:37.319 align:start position:0%
and tons of pink cards I may say please
 
00:41:39.589 --> 00:41:39.599 align:start position:0%
limit and then typically as we get let's
 
00:41:40.950 --> 00:41:40.960 align:start position:0%
say it's one of those situations where
 
00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
there's a whole bunch of speakers and I
 
00:41:45.910 --> 00:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
get getting you know halfway through
 
00:41:47.589 --> 00:41:47.599 align:start position:0%
twoth thirds of the way through and
 
00:41:49.829 --> 00:41:49.839 align:start position:0%
somebody's going to talk for 10 minutes
 
00:41:53.309 --> 00:41:53.319 align:start position:0%
I may say okay could further could
 
00:41:55.990 --> 00:41:56.000 align:start position:0%
future speakers please avoid talking
 
00:41:57.069 --> 00:41:57.079 align:start position:0%
about the same things that have already
 
00:41:59.030 --> 00:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
been talked about please you know add on
 
00:42:01.950 --> 00:42:01.960 align:start position:0%
to what you've had so that we keep uh
 
00:42:06.069 --> 00:42:06.079 align:start position:0%
people awake and um get through it
 
00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:08.240 align:start position:0%
so Susan did you have something you want
 
00:42:12.670 --> 00:42:12.680 align:start position:0%
to say are you going to talk about when
 
00:42:15.550 --> 00:42:15.560 align:start position:0%
the lobbyists and the department people
 
00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:17.589 align:start position:0%
the lobbyists and the department people
can

00:42:17.589 --> 00:42:17.599 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:42:17.599 --> 00:42:19.549 align:start position:0%
can
speak

00:42:19.549 --> 00:42:19.559 align:start position:0%
speak
 
00:42:22.950 --> 00:42:22.960 align:start position:0%
um possibly but uh thank you for
 
00:42:24.510 --> 00:42:24.520 align:start position:0%
bringing that up I did write an outline
 
00:42:26.549 --> 00:42:26.559 align:start position:0%
for myself but it's very that's why it's
 
00:42:29.069 --> 00:42:29.079 align:start position:0%
very easy to to miss something um
 
00:42:31.750 --> 00:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
typically what we do is we have
 
00:42:33.910 --> 00:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
um I guess you can correct me if I'm
 
00:42:37.829 --> 00:42:37.839 align:start position:0%
wrong but typically um if I have sen
 
00:42:40.309 --> 00:42:40.319 align:start position:0%
state senators and state reps here we
 
00:42:42.349 --> 00:42:42.359 align:start position:0%
typically after the bill is introduced
 
00:42:44.510 --> 00:42:44.520 align:start position:0%
we'll typically hear from uh state
 
00:42:47.230 --> 00:42:47.240 align:start position:0%
senators first um because they typically
 
00:42:50.190 --> 00:42:50.200 align:start position:0%
have many things going on um also try to
 
00:42:51.790 --> 00:42:51.800 align:start position:0%
hear from State reps who are on other
 
00:42:53.910 --> 00:42:53.920 align:start position:0%
committees because they're probably here
 
00:42:55.069 --> 00:42:55.079 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to get back to their
 
00:42:57.430 --> 00:42:57.440 align:start position:0%
committee so we'll hear from them uh
 
00:43:00.589 --> 00:43:00.599 align:start position:0%
then we'll hear from the public did you
 
00:43:03.790 --> 00:43:03.800 align:start position:0%
have anything to is that um and the
 
00:43:06.030 --> 00:43:06.040 align:start position:0%
Departments and the left the Departments
 
00:43:07.510 --> 00:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
would probably be the
 
00:43:09.270 --> 00:43:09.280 align:start position:0%
Departments yeah the Departments would
 
00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:11.349 align:start position:0%
Departments yeah the Departments would
be

00:43:11.349 --> 00:43:11.359 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
last is that what you were
 
00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:15.670 align:start position:0%
last is that what you were
thinking

00:43:15.670 --> 00:43:15.680 align:start position:0%
thinking
 
00:43:19.549 --> 00:43:19.559 align:start position:0%
unless the department knows a lot more
 
00:43:23.470 --> 00:43:23.480 align:start position:0%
about the bill anybody else there sure
 
00:43:26.430 --> 00:43:26.440 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah if it's something where the
 
00:43:29.270 --> 00:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
department is is you know we I know that
 
00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:32.240 align:start position:0%
or people have questions we want to get
 
00:43:34.829 --> 00:43:34.839 align:start position:0%
the Department into uh answering that
 
00:43:36.990 --> 00:43:37.000 align:start position:0%
before we have people going on so that
 
00:43:40.349 --> 00:43:40.359 align:start position:0%
we can build on those uh
 
00:43:45.069 --> 00:43:45.079 align:start position:0%
answers okay yes represent so there's
 
00:43:47.630 --> 00:43:47.640 align:start position:0%
essentially no set time frame or
 
00:43:49.470 --> 00:43:49.480 align:start position:0%
structure for the questionings other
 
00:43:52.190 --> 00:43:52.200 align:start position:0%
than that the normally the Senators are
 
00:43:55.910 --> 00:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
first and followed by uh the lobbyist in
 
00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:59.069 align:start position:0%
first and followed by uh the lobbyist in
public

00:43:59.069 --> 00:43:59.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:01.870 --> 00:44:01.880 align:start position:0%
well State reps yeah W we're
 
00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:03.510 align:start position:0%
well State reps yeah W we're
insignificant

00:44:03.510 --> 00:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
insignificant
 
00:44:06.870 --> 00:44:06.880 align:start position:0%
um the the other question is you've got
 
00:44:08.750 --> 00:44:08.760 align:start position:0%
a blue sheet down at the end in pink
 
00:44:13.549 --> 00:44:13.559 align:start position:0%
cards and if anyone uh asks you if they
 
00:44:16.270 --> 00:44:16.280 align:start position:0%
have to talk no they can sign the blue
 
00:44:18.750 --> 00:44:18.760 align:start position:0%
sheet and they're just then it's just
 
00:44:21.630 --> 00:44:21.640 align:start position:0%
Pro or Con on the bill with no place for
 
00:44:24.150 --> 00:44:24.160 align:start position:0%
uh except for this there's this either
 
00:44:26.430 --> 00:44:26.440 align:start position:0%
Pro or Con on that you can also go
 
00:44:29.870 --> 00:44:29.880 align:start position:0%
online and uh if anyone asks for the
 
00:44:31.589 --> 00:44:31.599 align:start position:0%
Freshman there's a place online where
 
00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:33.280 align:start position:0%
you can make some comments that
 
00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
eventually gets into the record it gets
 
00:44:38.589 --> 00:44:38.599 align:start position:0%
into the record not necessarily read
 
00:44:43.430 --> 00:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
into uh the committee meeting um and
 
00:44:45.549 --> 00:44:45.559 align:start position:0%
depending upon what we do tomorrow that
 
00:44:47.430 --> 00:44:47.440 align:start position:0%
may change too there may be some changes
 
00:44:50.630 --> 00:44:50.640 align:start position:0%
there may not be probably won't be but
 
00:44:52.190 --> 00:44:52.200 align:start position:0%
public you're thinking public hearing
 
00:44:55.150 --> 00:44:55.160 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm thinking public hearing Bill 44
 
00:44:58.069 --> 00:44:58.079 align:start position:0%
but that you know that's whatever that
 
00:44:59.710 --> 00:44:59.720 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean currently for those of you
 
00:45:02.390 --> 00:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
who aren't up on this every bill has a
 
00:45:03.910 --> 00:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
public hearing no matter whether we
 
00:45:06.670 --> 00:45:06.680 align:start position:0%
think it's a crazy bill or not or it's
 
00:45:09.710 --> 00:45:09.720 align:start position:0%
every Bill uh gets a public hearing uh
 
00:45:12.750 --> 00:45:12.760 align:start position:0%
representa ol is referring to um a rule
 
00:45:14.910 --> 00:45:14.920 align:start position:0%
change that we'll be voting on tomorrow
 
00:45:19.630 --> 00:45:19.640 align:start position:0%
that um basically says that if um I may
 
00:45:22.069 --> 00:45:22.079 align:start position:0%
not have this complete but basically I
 
00:45:26.750 --> 00:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
think you a committee can um not would
 
00:45:28.390 --> 00:45:28.400 align:start position:0%
would have the ability not to hold a
 
00:45:31.069 --> 00:45:31.079 align:start position:0%
public hearing if is it three quarters
 
00:45:33.910 --> 00:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
three quarters of the committee uh say
 
00:45:36.230 --> 00:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
okay we don't hear so I mean we'll see
 
00:45:38.190 --> 00:45:38.200 align:start position:0%
what happens with that but that's the
 
00:45:40.230 --> 00:45:40.240 align:start position:0%
only caveat to what we're saying about
 
00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:41.549 align:start position:0%
only caveat to what we're saying about
public

00:45:41.549 --> 00:45:41.559 align:start position:0%
public
 
00:45:41.559 --> 00:45:43.190 align:start position:0%
public
hearings

00:45:43.190 --> 00:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
hearings
 
00:45:45.870 --> 00:45:45.880 align:start position:0%
yes U one other thing for the new
 
00:45:47.750 --> 00:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
members these little thingies that we
 
00:45:49.270 --> 00:45:49.280 align:start position:0%
have in front of us if you haven't used
 
00:45:52.230 --> 00:45:52.240 align:start position:0%
them before it's pressed to
 
00:45:55.430 --> 00:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
talk and press to listen because there's
 
00:45:57.589 --> 00:45:57.599 align:start position:0%
a speaker in here as well as a
 
00:45:58.950 --> 00:45:58.960 align:start position:0%
microphone you should have heard the
 
00:46:00.670 --> 00:46:00.680 align:start position:0%
difference in
 
00:46:04.710 --> 00:46:04.720 align:start position:0%
voice um so if the red light's on you're
 
00:46:06.750 --> 00:46:06.760 align:start position:0%
talking the red light's off you're
 
00:46:10.470 --> 00:46:10.480 align:start position:0%
listening all right see and keep the
 
00:46:12.950 --> 00:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
microphone close to your face not down
 
00:46:15.790 --> 00:46:15.800 align:start position:0%
the edge of the thing but because
 
00:46:17.390 --> 00:46:17.400 align:start position:0%
they're directional mics so you want to
 
00:46:19.230 --> 00:46:19.240 align:start position:0%
talk into the microphone if you want to
 
00:46:22.390 --> 00:46:22.400 align:start position:0%
be heard and this uh committee meeting
 
00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:24.160 align:start position:0%
and matter of fact all of them now
 
00:46:27.069 --> 00:46:27.079 align:start position:0%
aren't they being recorded are being
 
00:46:29.829 --> 00:46:29.839 align:start position:0%
recorded yeah I I don't know you're on
 
00:46:33.630 --> 00:46:33.640 align:start position:0%
video right now quite
 
00:46:35.910 --> 00:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
possibly you should always assume the
 
00:46:37.710 --> 00:46:37.720 align:start position:0%
the mic is
 
00:46:40.030 --> 00:46:40.040 align:start position:0%
open no no you're only supposed to say
 
00:46:41.180 --> 00:46:41.190 align:start position:0%
that to our
 
00:46:41.190 --> 00:46:43.190 align:start position:0%
that to our
[Laughter]

00:46:43.190 --> 00:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:46:48.270 --> 00:46:48.280 align:start position:0%
 okay um anything any
 
00:46:51.670 --> 00:46:51.680 align:start position:0%
questions okay um so th those are the
 
00:46:56.270 --> 00:46:56.280 align:start position:0%
public hearings um I will open um yeah I
 
00:46:58.549 --> 00:46:58.559 align:start position:0%
don't have my G my gav's over there but
 
00:47:01.910 --> 00:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
typically I'll have a gavel um I will
 
00:47:04.309 --> 00:47:04.319 align:start position:0%
hit the gavel open the public hearing
 
00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:06.640 align:start position:0%
when it's over I'll close the public
 
00:47:09.589 --> 00:47:09.599 align:start position:0%
hearing um the only other time I guess I
 
00:47:11.589 --> 00:47:11.599 align:start position:0%
would use a gavel in between that would
 
00:47:16.309 --> 00:47:16.319 align:start position:0%
be if um we needed to recess for some
 
00:47:19.390 --> 00:47:19.400 align:start position:0%
reason uh or if uh something was out of
 
00:47:22.030 --> 00:47:22.040 align:start position:0%
control um which I haven't seen happen
 
00:47:24.510 --> 00:47:24.520 align:start position:0%
in a in a long time so hopefully we we
 
00:47:28.510 --> 00:47:28.520 align:start position:0%
can continue that way um okay so bills
 
00:47:31.349 --> 00:47:31.359 align:start position:0%
go through basically three uh segments
 
00:47:33.030 --> 00:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
first the the public hearing we just
 
00:47:37.549 --> 00:47:37.559 align:start position:0%
talked about that next is the um work
 
00:47:39.630 --> 00:47:39.640 align:start position:0%
session although it doesn't have to go
 
00:47:40.950 --> 00:47:40.960 align:start position:0%
through a work session technically it
 
00:47:43.069 --> 00:47:43.079 align:start position:0%
could go right to an executive session
 
00:47:44.950 --> 00:47:44.960 align:start position:0%
typically I try to put every Bill
 
00:47:48.069 --> 00:47:48.079 align:start position:0%
through a work session unless it's it's
 
00:47:50.430 --> 00:47:50.440 align:start position:0%
a very simple Bill we're kind of all on
 
00:47:52.549 --> 00:47:52.559 align:start position:0%
board uh both parties are pretty much
 
00:47:54.510 --> 00:47:54.520 align:start position:0%
all on board on what it is we may go
 
00:47:57.349 --> 00:47:57.359 align:start position:0%
directly to an exec session and uh
 
00:47:59.270 --> 00:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
and and vote on it but but first let me
 
00:48:02.270 --> 00:48:02.280 align:start position:0%
cover work sessions so work sessions
 
00:48:04.829 --> 00:48:04.839 align:start position:0%
basically are an opportunity to talk
 
00:48:07.230 --> 00:48:07.240 align:start position:0%
about the bill okay by now we've heard
 
00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
we've heard the uh we've gone through
 
00:48:13.829 --> 00:48:13.839 align:start position:0%
the public um um the public hearings um
 
00:48:15.950 --> 00:48:15.960 align:start position:0%
we've got information we discuss it
 
00:48:19.150 --> 00:48:19.160 align:start position:0%
amongst ourselves and um somebody may
 
00:48:21.190 --> 00:48:21.200 align:start position:0%
bring an amendment to to the bill saying
 
00:48:23.309 --> 00:48:23.319 align:start position:0%
you know I I brought an amendment uh
 
00:48:25.190 --> 00:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
here's what I think and you know we can
 
00:48:27.270 --> 00:48:27.280 align:start position:0%
discuss that um
 
00:48:30.109 --> 00:48:30.119 align:start position:0%
um once I once I feel like okay we've
 
00:48:32.950 --> 00:48:32.960 align:start position:0%
pretty much exhausted uh that discussion
 
00:48:34.790 --> 00:48:34.800 align:start position:0%
we'll end the the work session on that
 
00:48:37.390 --> 00:48:37.400 align:start position:0%
bill and um we can either go on to
 
00:48:38.950 --> 00:48:38.960 align:start position:0%
another work session on another bill or
 
00:48:40.510 --> 00:48:40.520 align:start position:0%
we could go on to an executive session
 
00:48:43.349 --> 00:48:43.359 align:start position:0%
on that bill typically if the bill was
 
00:48:45.030 --> 00:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
somewhat complicated or there's
 
00:48:47.030 --> 00:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
follow-up needed or somebody's going to
 
00:48:49.430 --> 00:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
get an amendment or something typically
 
00:48:50.789 --> 00:48:50.799 align:start position:0%
obviously we would not do an exec
 
00:48:52.870 --> 00:48:52.880 align:start position:0%
session we not vote on it we' I'd say
 
00:48:55.190 --> 00:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
okay we'll we'll push this off for a
 
00:48:56.950 --> 00:48:56.960 align:start position:0%
couple of weeks while or a week while we
 
00:48:58.829 --> 00:48:58.839 align:start position:0%
gather information and we'll have an
 
00:49:01.670 --> 00:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
exec session on it at that
 
00:49:05.069 --> 00:49:05.079 align:start position:0%
time uh and then lastly is the uh bill
 
00:49:06.750 --> 00:49:06.760 align:start position:0%
then can go through an exec session
 
00:49:08.789 --> 00:49:08.799 align:start position:0%
where typically somebody will make a
 
00:49:13.870 --> 00:49:13.880 align:start position:0%
motion they make a motion um to itl uh
 
00:49:15.349 --> 00:49:15.359 align:start position:0%
the bill let's say which would be
 
00:49:16.870 --> 00:49:16.880 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate which is
 
00:49:18.870 --> 00:49:18.880 align:start position:0%
basically saying we as a committee are
 
00:49:20.430 --> 00:49:20.440 align:start position:0%
going to recommend to the Full House
 
00:49:24.150 --> 00:49:24.160 align:start position:0%
that they kill this bill if it goes itl
 
00:49:27.630 --> 00:49:27.640 align:start position:0%
once it has a second then we discuss it
 
00:49:29.710 --> 00:49:29.720 align:start position:0%
once discussion is done I can call for a
 
00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:31.430 align:start position:0%
once discussion is done I can call for a
vote

00:49:31.430 --> 00:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
vote
 
00:49:35.750 --> 00:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
um and um go you know and go from there
 
00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:38.640 align:start position:0%
the clerk would call the role um the
 
00:49:41.829 --> 00:49:41.839 align:start position:0%
role starts with uh the vice chair is
 
00:49:44.670 --> 00:49:44.680 align:start position:0%
called first to answer how they would
 
00:49:47.150 --> 00:49:47.160 align:start position:0%
vote um since the Republicans have a
 
00:49:49.470 --> 00:49:49.480 align:start position:0%
majority the Republicans would then uh
 
00:49:51.109 --> 00:49:51.119 align:start position:0%
we go through the list each would vote
 
00:49:53.109 --> 00:49:53.119 align:start position:0%
then we go to the
 
00:49:57.150 --> 00:49:57.160 align:start position:0%
um ranking Democrat start first yeah so
 
00:49:58.710 --> 00:49:58.720 align:start position:0%
the ranking Democrat would start first
 
00:49:59.870 --> 00:49:59.880 align:start position:0%
and then we go down the line of
 
00:50:02.270 --> 00:50:02.280 align:start position:0%
Democrats and then the chair who's me
 
00:50:04.069 --> 00:50:04.079 align:start position:0%
obviously would vote
 
00:50:04.079 --> 00:50:06.430 align:start position:0%
obviously would vote
last

00:50:06.430 --> 00:50:06.440 align:start position:0%
last
 
00:50:09.870 --> 00:50:09.880 align:start position:0%
um let's see so it could be itl and
 
00:50:14.990 --> 00:50:15.000 align:start position:0%
experential legislate um it could be um
 
00:50:17.589 --> 00:50:17.599 align:start position:0%
that o OTP ought to pass is the
 
00:50:19.549 --> 00:50:19.559 align:start position:0%
terminology we use if we want to pass a
 
00:50:24.069 --> 00:50:24.079 align:start position:0%
bill um we could
 
00:50:27.069 --> 00:50:27.079 align:start position:0%
um I guess if we defer a bill we don't
 
00:50:32.710 --> 00:50:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:34.990 --> 00:50:35.000 align:start position:0%
make yeah or you right you could have an
 
00:50:37.510 --> 00:50:37.520 align:start position:0%
not to pass with an amendment uh in
 
00:50:39.510 --> 00:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
which case you need to pass the
 
00:50:41.390 --> 00:50:41.400 align:start position:0%
amendment first or you need to vote not
 
00:50:42.750 --> 00:50:42.760 align:start position:0%
pass you need to vote on the amendment
 
00:50:44.309 --> 00:50:44.319 align:start position:0%
first and then then we'd vote on the
 
00:50:45.710 --> 00:50:45.720 align:start position:0%
underlying Bill sometimes there's more
 
00:50:48.470 --> 00:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
than one Amendment and we'd have to um
 
00:50:50.349 --> 00:50:50.359 align:start position:0%
you know handle each Amendment first and
 
00:50:52.190 --> 00:50:52.200 align:start position:0%
then and then the
 
00:50:56.390 --> 00:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
bill any Jordan or or anyone else have
 
00:50:57.950 --> 00:50:57.960 align:start position:0%
any anything to add to that or any
 
00:51:00.510 --> 00:51:00.520 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative om yes as
 
00:51:02.829 --> 00:51:02.839 align:start position:0%
the clerk I believe the chairman post
 
00:51:09.030 --> 00:51:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:12.230 --> 00:51:12.240 align:start position:0%
you anyone have any questions and you'll
 
00:51:13.950 --> 00:51:13.960 align:start position:0%
get to know you I mean those of you who
 
00:51:15.430 --> 00:51:15.440 align:start position:0%
are new will get those of you who have
 
00:51:17.309 --> 00:51:17.319 align:start position:0%
been on other committees I think the
 
00:51:20.390 --> 00:51:20.400 align:start position:0%
process should be pretty similar um and
 
00:51:22.430 --> 00:51:22.440 align:start position:0%
those of you who are new will get it
 
00:51:24.750 --> 00:51:24.760 align:start position:0%
pretty quickly I think as to what what
 
00:51:27.150 --> 00:51:27.160 align:start position:0%
happens it's not not a complicated
 
00:51:29.470 --> 00:51:29.480 align:start position:0%
process it's more just understanding how
 
00:51:31.309 --> 00:51:31.319 align:start position:0%
it goes
 
00:51:33.820 --> 00:51:33.830 align:start position:0%
together okay what else do we have
 
00:51:33.830 --> 00:51:40.109 align:start position:0%
together okay what else do we have
[Music]

00:51:40.109 --> 00:51:40.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:45.990 --> 00:51:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:50.990 --> 00:51:51.000 align:start position:0%
yes no um everyone knows who yes that
 
00:51:54.589 --> 00:51:54.599 align:start position:0%
might not be a bad idea um yes I'd like

I'll just talk about our next meetings
 
00:55:21.990 --> 00:55:22.000 align:start position:0%

o'clock we're going to hear from the um
 
00:55:41.829 --> 00:55:41.839 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Society of certified

public accountants um we obviously do a
 
00:55:47.710 --> 00:55:47.720 align:start position:0%
lot with taxes in this committee and so
 
00:55:50.029 --> 00:55:50.039 align:start position:0%
hearing from them is uh is a valuable
 
00:55:52.910 --> 00:55:52.920 align:start position:0%
resource um I that's um slated for about
 
00:55:56.309 --> 00:55:56.319 align:start position:0%
an hour so we should be done by 2 o' uh
 
00:55:58.670 --> 00:55:58.680 align:start position:0%
for those of you trying to plan your
 
00:55:58.680 --> 00:56:00.270 align:start position:0%
for those of you trying to plan your
afternoon

00:56:00.270 --> 00:56:00.280 align:start position:0%
afternoon
 
00:56:04.510 --> 00:56:04.520 align:start position:0%
um so we will um so I'll just I'm going
 
00:56:06.510 --> 00:56:06.520 align:start position:0%
to talk about the next two meetings
 
00:56:10.309 --> 00:56:10.319 align:start position:0%
briefly and uh so as you probably know
 
00:56:12.349 --> 00:56:12.359 align:start position:0%
and I assume those of you who are new
 
00:56:14.870 --> 00:56:14.880 align:start position:0%
you know that you can see the calendars
 
00:56:17.510 --> 00:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
online uh to know what's what's coming
 
00:56:21.390 --> 00:56:21.400 align:start position:0%
up and so forth um so we have meetings
 
00:56:23.710 --> 00:56:23.720 align:start position:0%
scheduled now on the 13th and 14th
 
00:56:26.349 --> 00:56:26.359 align:start position:0%
Monday and Tuesday of next week um both
 
00:56:28.309 --> 00:56:28.319 align:start position:0%
of those start at 9:00 which is an
 
00:56:30.270 --> 00:56:30.280 align:start position:0%
earlier start than I normally start most
 
00:56:31.549 --> 00:56:31.559 align:start position:0%
of the time most of our meetings will
 
00:56:32.630 --> 00:56:32.640 align:start position:0%
start at
 
00:56:35.829 --> 00:56:35.839 align:start position:0%
10:00 um and the reason I'm starting at
 
00:56:37.190 --> 00:56:37.200 align:start position:0%
9: is because we have a lot to get
 
00:56:40.430 --> 00:56:40.440 align:start position:0%
through and I want to finish by uh 3
 
00:56:43.950 --> 00:56:43.960 align:start position:0%
3:30 time frame um and not uh because
 
00:56:45.910 --> 00:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
people who are on boards in their
 
00:56:47.230 --> 00:56:47.240 align:start position:0%
hometowns you know whether it's
 
00:56:48.990 --> 00:56:49.000 align:start position:0%
selectman or planning board or whatever
 
00:56:52.670 --> 00:56:52.680 align:start position:0%
it is uh typically we we try to you know
 
00:56:55.910 --> 00:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
keep that keep that in mind um as well
 
00:56:58.150 --> 00:56:58.160 align:start position:0%
as just other other things that uh need
 
00:57:00.870 --> 00:57:00.880 align:start position:0%
to be done in your personal life so um
 
00:57:03.109 --> 00:57:03.119 align:start position:0%
so we will start at 9:00 both those days
 
00:57:05.430 --> 00:57:05.440 align:start position:0%
and as I said most times it'll be 10:00
 
00:57:07.710 --> 00:57:07.720 align:start position:0%
U but it'll be noticed in the calendar
 
00:57:10.950 --> 00:57:10.960 align:start position:0%
um just for planning purposes I believe
 
00:57:12.710 --> 00:57:12.720 align:start position:0%
I don't have it scheduled yet but most
 
00:57:16.630 --> 00:57:16.640 align:start position:0%
likely we'll meet uh the following
 
00:57:19.069 --> 00:57:19.079 align:start position:0%
week um okay we already know about
 
00:57:21.430 --> 00:57:21.440 align:start position:0%
Monday the 13th Tuesday the 14th the
 
00:57:24.990 --> 00:57:25.000 align:start position:0%
following week uh the the 20th is Martin
 
00:57:27.270 --> 00:57:27.280 align:start position:0%
Luther King Day um we will not meet on
 
00:57:29.549 --> 00:57:29.559 align:start position:0%
that day typically this this committee
 
00:57:32.549 --> 00:57:32.559 align:start position:0%
will meet on Mondays and Tuesdays in
 
00:57:36.950 --> 00:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
general um we share this room for those
 
00:57:41.029 --> 00:57:41.039 align:start position:0%
of you who are new um before covid that
 
00:57:44.390 --> 00:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
that you see the sliding um or I should
 
00:57:46.670 --> 00:57:46.680 align:start position:0%
call it accordion door used to be closed
 
00:57:49.029 --> 00:57:49.039 align:start position:0%
all the time and each committee would be
 
00:57:50.309 --> 00:57:50.319 align:start position:0%
you know like Ways and Means would you
 
00:57:52.750 --> 00:57:52.760 align:start position:0%
be just in this side and criminal
 
00:57:55.470 --> 00:57:55.480 align:start position:0%
justice uh would be on the other side
 
00:57:56.789 --> 00:57:56.799 align:start position:0%
for example
 
00:57:58.870 --> 00:57:58.880 align:start position:0%
uh but since Co and we opened up the
 
00:58:01.390 --> 00:58:01.400 align:start position:0%
room to create more space we've kept it
 
00:58:03.589 --> 00:58:03.599 align:start position:0%
that way ever since so we share this
 
00:58:06.430 --> 00:58:06.440 align:start position:0%
double room with criminal justice um and
 
00:58:08.750 --> 00:58:08.760 align:start position:0%
I've talked to uh uh representative
 
00:58:10.589 --> 00:58:10.599 align:start position:0%
Terry Roy we're going to continue what
 
00:58:13.190 --> 00:58:13.200 align:start position:0%
we did last year which was Ways and
 
00:58:15.670 --> 00:58:15.680 align:start position:0%
Means will take Mondays and Tuesdays
 
00:58:17.309 --> 00:58:17.319 align:start position:0%
criminal justice will take Wednesday
 
00:58:18.589 --> 00:58:18.599 align:start position:0%
Thursdays and
 
00:58:21.710 --> 00:58:21.720 align:start position:0%
Fridays um but we'll share Wednesdays
 
00:58:24.270 --> 00:58:24.280 align:start position:0%
from time to time so the week of the
 
00:58:26.549 --> 00:58:26.559 align:start position:0%
20th is one of those times um I've
 
00:58:27.870 --> 00:58:27.880 align:start position:0%
already talked to him and communicated
 
00:58:31.109 --> 00:58:31.119 align:start position:0%
with him so plan on Tuesday the
 
00:58:34.789 --> 00:58:34.799 align:start position:0%
21st and Wednesday the 22nd that will
 
00:58:37.670 --> 00:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
have meetings
 
00:58:41.990 --> 00:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
um and I'm not sure what you know the
 
00:58:44.710 --> 00:58:44.720 align:start position:0%
the that meetings those meetings will be
 
00:58:46.270 --> 00:58:46.280 align:start position:0%
yet because it's could be a mix of
 
00:58:48.270 --> 00:58:48.280 align:start position:0%
hearing from agencies because as I said
 
00:58:50.069 --> 00:58:50.079 align:start position:0%
one of our jobs is to do Revenue
 
00:58:53.510 --> 00:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
estimates and I may start a couple of
 
00:58:56.670 --> 00:58:56.680 align:start position:0%
public hearings on um the bills that we
 
00:58:58.630 --> 00:58:58.640 align:start position:0%
have so which day I'm going to do that
 
00:59:00.349 --> 00:59:00.359 align:start position:0%
and so forth I don't know but but I
 
00:59:02.750 --> 00:59:02.760 align:start position:0%
would say we need both of those days um
 
00:59:04.510 --> 00:59:04.520 align:start position:0%
I'll probably start the start time and
 
00:59:07.789 --> 00:59:07.799 align:start position:0%
those probably will be 10 o'clock
 
00:59:12.349 --> 00:59:12.359 align:start position:0%
um unless there's some issue with uh
 
00:59:13.789 --> 00:59:13.799 align:start position:0%
somebody presenting a bill but I
 
00:59:15.549 --> 00:59:15.559 align:start position:0%
typically try to stay away from 9:00 the
 
00:59:17.230 --> 00:59:17.240 align:start position:0%
earliest it would probably be as 9:30
 
00:59:19.270 --> 00:59:19.280 align:start position:0%
but uh you'll see the times come out of
 
00:59:23.510 --> 00:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
the calendar um or I I may even know by
 
00:59:25.470 --> 00:59:25.480 align:start position:0%
by you know let's say the 13th or 14th
 
00:59:27.349 --> 00:59:27.359 align:start position:0%
when we meet and can announce it then as
 
00:59:29.390 --> 00:59:29.400 align:start position:0%
well but definitely reserve the 21st and
 
00:59:29.400 --> 00:59:32.109 align:start position:0%
well but definitely reserve the 21st and
the

00:59:32.109 --> 00:59:32.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:34.549 --> 00:59:34.559 align:start position:0%
22nd as well
 
00:59:38.430 --> 00:59:38.440 align:start position:0%
so yes represent Al me
 
00:59:41.069 --> 00:59:41.079 align:start position:0%
yeah I'd like
 
00:59:44.910 --> 00:59:44.920 align:start position:0%
to to talk tell my
 
00:59:47.029 --> 00:59:47.039 align:start position:0%
caucus on
 
00:59:50.750 --> 00:59:50.760 align:start position:0%
that we are going to have to we are not
 
00:59:53.589 --> 00:59:53.599 align:start position:0%
finishing until 2 most of us are going
 
00:59:56.630 --> 00:59:56.640 align:start position:0%
to take an hour to get back home and we
 
00:59:57.589 --> 00:59:57.599 align:start position:0%
have a
 
01:00:02.430 --> 01:00:02.440 align:start position:0%
caucus a general caucus starting at
 
01:00:09.270 --> 01:00:09.280 align:start position:0%
3: so we H today today okay that's right
 
01:00:15.630 --> 01:00:15.640 align:start position:0%
so so we can't um meet informally to
 
01:00:17.190 --> 01:00:17.200 align:start position:0%
talk about what we've just been
 
01:00:19.589 --> 01:00:19.599 align:start position:0%
listening to and other questions
 
01:00:22.150 --> 01:00:22.160 align:start position:0%
until I am
 
01:00:25.589 --> 01:00:25.599 align:start position:0%
not um sure when this week is pretty
 
01:00:25.599 --> 01:00:27.029 align:start position:0%
not um sure when this week is pretty
messy

01:00:27.029 --> 01:00:27.039 align:start position:0%
messy
 
01:00:31.309 --> 01:00:31.319 align:start position:0%
unless we uh got together somehow on
 
01:00:34.950 --> 01:00:34.960 align:start position:0%
Friday we're going to have to wait until
 
01:00:37.510 --> 01:00:37.520 align:start position:0%
next week and stay
 
01:00:41.589 --> 01:00:41.599 align:start position:0%
after the the meetings on T Monday
 
01:00:44.230 --> 01:00:44.240 align:start position:0%
Tuesday Monday or
 
01:00:49.950 --> 01:00:49.960 align:start position:0%
Tuesday we can discuss it online but on
 
01:00:53.950 --> 01:00:53.960 align:start position:0%
I presume the Republicans also will be
 
01:00:58.190 --> 01:00:58.200 align:start position:0%
integrating in a informal caucus
 
01:01:05.470 --> 01:01:05.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:08.789 --> 01:01:08.799 align:start position:0%
okay I think that's all that's all I
 
01:01:10.150 --> 01:01:10.160 align:start position:0%
really have right now does anyone have
 
01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:12.309 align:start position:0%
really have right now does anyone have
any

01:01:12.309 --> 01:01:12.319 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:01:15.829 --> 01:01:15.839 align:start position:0%
questions yes thank you Mr chair so you
 
01:01:18.470 --> 01:01:18.480 align:start position:0%
said we want to have our results ready
 
01:01:23.589 --> 01:01:23.599 align:start position:0%
for the finance committees by February
 
01:01:26.910 --> 01:01:26.920 align:start position:0%
15th by February 15th okay now he I know
 
01:01:28.510 --> 01:01:28.520 align:start position:0%
that I'm going to get pushed to give
 
01:01:31.309 --> 01:01:31.319 align:start position:0%
some preliminaries sooner but we won't
 
01:01:35.029 --> 01:01:35.039 align:start position:0%
publicize anything until that time frame
 
01:01:37.390 --> 01:01:37.400 align:start position:0%
okay I I just wanted to check because
 
01:01:40.710 --> 01:01:40.720 align:start position:0%
it's a Saturday so I just thought I'd I
 
01:01:42.829 --> 01:01:42.839 align:start position:0%
mean technically we're
 
01:01:44.990 --> 01:01:45.000 align:start position:0%
proba yeah I'm I'm not sure how that
 
01:01:46.789 --> 01:01:46.799 align:start position:0%
works that's February 15th is the date
 
01:01:48.349 --> 01:01:48.359 align:start position:0%
the governor is supposed to have their
 
01:01:52.230 --> 01:01:52.240 align:start position:0%
budget out as well
 
01:01:56.309 --> 01:01:56.319 align:start position:0%
uh and it won't be a Saturday right so
 
01:01:59.349 --> 01:01:59.359 align:start position:0%
so we say onor about the
 
01:02:03.710 --> 01:02:03.720 align:start position:0%
15th um okay um so that's all I I would
 
01:02:06.990 --> 01:02:07.000 align:start position:0%
just suggest that you resist every
 
01:02:10.430 --> 01:02:10.440 align:start position:0%
effort to get it out earlier than when
 
01:02:12.390 --> 01:02:12.400 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget is
 
01:02:14.990 --> 01:02:15.000 align:start position:0%
coming because that's when they really
 
01:02:17.390 --> 01:02:17.400 align:start position:0%
need it we want to make sure that we as
 
01:02:20.750 --> 01:02:20.760 align:start position:0%
a committee pretty much agree on where
 
01:02:24.069 --> 01:02:24.079 align:start position:0%
that number should be and um we we've
 
01:02:26.470 --> 01:02:26.480 align:start position:0%
done fairly well in the past um and
 
01:02:28.029 --> 01:02:28.039 align:start position:0%
that's because
 
01:02:30.950 --> 01:02:30.960 align:start position:0%
we've taken our time to listen to the
 
01:02:32.710 --> 01:02:32.720 align:start position:0%
agencies talk about it figure it out
 
01:02:35.470 --> 01:02:35.480 align:start position:0%
there's macroeconomic issues uh
 
01:02:37.510 --> 01:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
Countrywide worldwide there's also State
 
01:02:40.029 --> 01:02:40.039 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire issues and we've got to
 
01:02:41.430 --> 01:02:41.440 align:start position:0%
integrate all those and come up with
 
01:02:43.910 --> 01:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
what we think the um the revenues are
 
01:02:45.750 --> 01:02:45.760 align:start position:0%
going to look like
 
01:02:49.430 --> 01:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
yes we'll also find that we get a set of
 
01:02:51.789 --> 01:02:51.799 align:start position:0%
preliminary numbers and then as we get
 
01:02:54.510 --> 01:02:54.520 align:start position:0%
closer to tax day in April the numbers
 
01:02:56.710 --> 01:02:56.720 align:start position:0%
become more firm
 
01:02:58.910 --> 01:02:58.920 align:start position:0%
uh because there's some uh preliminary
 
01:03:00.349 --> 01:03:00.359 align:start position:0%
payments that have been made on some of
 
01:03:02.870 --> 01:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
the business taxes and such you will
 
01:03:07.029 --> 01:03:07.039 align:start position:0%
receive a copy of focus which uh gives
 
01:03:09.789 --> 01:03:09.799 align:start position:0%
some explanation as to where and why the
 
01:03:11.870 --> 01:03:11.880 align:start position:0%
numbers are that they say that they are
 
01:03:15.150 --> 01:03:15.160 align:start position:0%
where they are uh I wouldn't pay too
 
01:03:18.910 --> 01:03:18.920 align:start position:0%
much attention to being uh a bracketed
 
01:03:21.349 --> 01:03:21.359 align:start position:0%
meaning negative number right now
 
01:03:24.029 --> 01:03:24.039 align:start position:0%
because you got money coming in later in
 
01:03:26.910 --> 01:03:26.920 align:start position:0%
the fiscal year and calendar year
 
01:03:29.430 --> 01:03:29.440 align:start position:0%
oftentimes get confused so keep that
 
01:03:32.549 --> 01:03:32.559 align:start position:0%
kind of straight in your your
 
01:03:36.150 --> 01:03:36.160 align:start position:0%
head yes represent Al me yeah I think it
 
01:03:40.029 --> 01:03:40.039 align:start position:0%
would be useful to take the committee
 
01:03:42.670 --> 01:03:42.680 align:start position:0%
through or at least the new people
 
01:03:44.630 --> 01:03:44.640 align:start position:0%
through the revenue
 
01:03:49.109 --> 01:03:49.119 align:start position:0%
focus and what it does it's it's the it
 
01:03:53.230 --> 01:03:53.240 align:start position:0%
comes out every month and up to 3 days
 
01:03:56.630 --> 01:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
after the working days after after the
 
01:03:59.269 --> 01:03:59.279 align:start position:0%
month is over depending on how
 
01:04:03.910 --> 01:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
complicated it was and it includes a
 
01:04:10.190 --> 01:04:10.200 align:start position:0%
description of what is um what that tax
 
01:04:12.910 --> 01:04:12.920 align:start position:0%
was doing in comparison to the prior
 
01:04:16.630 --> 01:04:16.640 align:start position:0%
year and in comparison to and and what
 
01:04:19.190 --> 01:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
it's been doing over the entire year up
 
01:04:23.230 --> 01:04:23.240 align:start position:0%
to that date and the year starts in July
 
01:04:29.150 --> 01:04:29.160 align:start position:0%
um and it's oh uh it also includes
 
01:04:32.710 --> 01:04:32.720 align:start position:0%
things like uh well the insurance money
 
01:04:35.150 --> 01:04:35.160 align:start position:0%
was just laate it's coming in right
 
01:04:38.870 --> 01:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
away so don't worry about that part of
 
01:04:41.910 --> 01:04:41.920 align:start position:0%
it so this kind of thing it' be good I
 
01:04:44.630 --> 01:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
think to have an introduction for at
 
01:04:47.309 --> 01:04:47.319 align:start position:0%
least yeah ju so just as a
 
01:04:50.549 --> 01:04:50.559 align:start position:0%
um the it's being pass around now just
 
01:04:52.109 --> 01:04:52.119 align:start position:0%
to kind of so you kind of see what it
 
01:04:56.390 --> 01:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:58.390 --> 01:04:58.400 align:start position:0%
this is on the
 
01:05:00.710 --> 01:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
internet you go
 
01:05:03.910 --> 01:05:03.920 align:start position:0%
to administrative
 
01:05:07.150 --> 01:05:07.160 align:start position:0%
services financial side I forget maybe
 
01:05:11.029 --> 01:05:11.039 align:start position:0%
you've got got the exact name of it down
 
01:05:14.190 --> 01:05:14.200 align:start position:0%
but um and division of Department of
 
01:05:17.069 --> 01:05:17.079 align:start position:0%
administrative Services the financial

03:08:14.590 --> 03:08:14.600 align:start position:0%
and our history I just wanted to have a
 
03:08:17.550 --> 03:08:17.560 align:start position:0%
quick introduction on uh interest in
 
03:08:19.389 --> 03:08:19.399 align:start position:0%
dividends I guess the introduction is
 
03:08:21.110 --> 03:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
last week there was a funeral for it
 
03:08:24.030 --> 03:08:24.040 align:start position:0%
right I hear so it's it's dead so I
 
03:08:25.990 --> 03:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
guess there's not a whole lot to talk
 
03:08:28.910 --> 03:08:28.920 align:start position:0%
about but I would but I would note this
 
03:08:30.750 --> 03:08:30.760 align:start position:0%
uh and I guess you you all may know
 
03:08:32.830 --> 03:08:32.840 align:start position:0%
enough about it it was a we all knew it
 
03:08:36.710 --> 03:08:36.720 align:start position:0%
as a 5% tax on interest and dividends
 
03:08:38.309 --> 03:08:38.319 align:start position:0%
and then it just kept getting more
 
03:08:40.670 --> 03:08:40.680 align:start position:0%
complex and more difficult and things to
 
03:08:44.229 --> 03:08:44.239 align:start position:0%
administer became harder and harder like
 
03:08:47.110 --> 03:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
um the transferable interest rules that
 
03:08:49.550 --> 03:08:49.560 align:start position:0%
came up about where certain dividends
 
03:08:52.750 --> 03:08:52.760 align:start position:0%
from certain llc's were also taxable and
 
03:08:57.190 --> 03:08:57.200 align:start position:0%
then we had a lot of 754 transactions
 
03:08:59.750 --> 03:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
where companies were liquidating and
 
03:09:01.550 --> 03:09:01.560 align:start position:0%
interest and dividends got interesting
 
03:09:04.830 --> 03:09:04.840 align:start position:0%
for those so I sit back here and look at
 
03:09:06.790 --> 03:09:06.800 align:start position:0%
it I'm going like I'm even glad that
 
03:09:09.870 --> 03:09:09.880 align:start position:0%
thing's gone because it just got to be
 
03:09:11.670 --> 03:09:11.680 align:start position:0%
more and more difficult every year we
 
03:09:14.429 --> 03:09:14.439 align:start position:0%
went out back in
 
03:09:17.229 --> 03:09:17.239 align:start position:0%
2014 I was actually appointed by so
 
03:09:18.710 --> 03:09:18.720 align:start position:0%
that's this is why probably know some of
 
03:09:22.309 --> 03:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
you by um Governor Lynch at the time to
 
03:09:24.510 --> 03:09:24.520 align:start position:0%
head a commission on the study of
 
03:09:27.510 --> 03:09:27.520 align:start position:0%
business taxes and I look at the
 
03:09:29.830 --> 03:09:29.840 align:start position:0%
document quite a few years ago right 10
 
03:09:31.510 --> 03:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
years ago and if you look through it
 
03:09:33.469 --> 03:09:33.479 align:start position:0%
there are things we wanted thought would
 
03:09:36.150 --> 03:09:36.160 align:start position:0%
make Better Tax Administration and good
 
03:09:38.309 --> 03:09:38.319 align:start position:0%
things to do and I look at the list and
 
03:09:40.550 --> 03:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
it's amazing how many of those have been
 
03:09:43.710 --> 03:09:43.720 align:start position:0%
looked at how many have been changed and
 
03:09:45.710 --> 03:09:45.720 align:start position:0%
our recommendation even for interest in
 
03:09:49.389 --> 03:09:49.399 align:start position:0%
dividends tax was to make it simple just
 
03:09:51.830 --> 03:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
follow what a taxpayer would have on
 
03:09:53.429 --> 03:09:53.439 align:start position:0%
their schedule B for interest in
 
03:09:55.910 --> 03:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
dividends and call it a day put whatever
 
03:09:58.070 --> 03:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
rate you want it but make it much more
 
03:10:02.030 --> 03:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
simpler to admin administer so I guess I
 
03:10:03.469 --> 03:10:03.479 align:start position:0%
I sit back and look at if that thing
 
03:10:06.269 --> 03:10:06.279 align:start position:0%
ever comes back let's call it something
 
03:10:09.510 --> 03:10:09.520 align:start position:0%
different let's make it easy and uh it
 
03:10:11.590 --> 03:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
would certainly make a lot more sense
 
03:10:13.269 --> 03:10:13.279 align:start position:0%
you know you we live in a state where
 
03:10:14.510 --> 03:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
people don't even think there's an
 
03:10:16.990 --> 03:10:17.000 align:start position:0%
income tax so as CPA we sit back and
 
03:10:18.630 --> 03:10:18.640 align:start position:0%
someone comes in and we tell them
 
03:10:20.429 --> 03:10:20.439 align:start position:0%
they're going to be taxed on interest
 
03:10:22.349 --> 03:10:22.359 align:start position:0%
and dividends and they go but I moved
 
03:10:24.510 --> 03:10:24.520 align:start position:0%
here because there's no income tax so
 
03:10:25.870 --> 03:10:25.880 align:start position:0%
that's the first thing you have to get
 
03:10:29.110 --> 03:10:29.120 align:start position:0%
over usually with that tax the second
 
03:10:30.710 --> 03:10:30.720 align:start position:0%
thing and I guess my thought at this
 
03:10:33.349 --> 03:10:33.359 align:start position:0%
point in time is it used I used to
 
03:10:35.070 --> 03:10:35.080 align:start position:0%
always think of interest in dividends as
 
03:10:38.710 --> 03:10:38.720 align:start position:0%
being a even 60 million 70 million maybe
 
03:10:40.830 --> 03:10:40.840 align:start position:0%
Revenue I think we all know last year
 
03:10:42.070 --> 03:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
was like
 
03:10:44.590 --> 03:10:44.600 align:start position:0%
185 but that was a really interesting
 
03:10:46.469 --> 03:10:46.479 align:start position:0%
Year all of our clients showed up with
 
03:10:47.750 --> 03:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
these gigantic
 
03:10:50.830 --> 03:10:50.840 align:start position:0%
interest in dividends uh receipts from
 
03:10:53.269 --> 03:10:53.279 align:start position:0%
Banks from CDs from their investment
 
03:10:55.670 --> 03:10:55.680 align:start position:0%
companies and it was a oneoff I most of
 
03:10:57.750 --> 03:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
my clients already I'll tell you they're
 
03:11:00.590 --> 03:11:00.600 align:start position:0%
70 75% of what they had for income the
 
03:11:03.309 --> 03:11:03.319 align:start position:0%
year before so it's not like you can say
 
03:11:05.630 --> 03:11:05.640 align:start position:0%
we're losing 185 this year maybe it's
 
03:11:08.750 --> 03:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
down to 150 140 so it was going to go
 
03:11:12.229 --> 03:11:12.239 align:start position:0%
down anyway so is that enough to say
 
03:11:15.630 --> 03:11:15.640 align:start position:0%
about interest and dividends we had the
 
03:11:17.750 --> 03:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
funeral now we can move on
 
03:11:19.990 --> 03:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
do we have any questions any
 
03:11:22.550 --> 03:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
questions question Mr chairman represent
 
03:11:24.110 --> 03:11:24.120 align:start position:0%
do you think changing the word from
 
03:11:28.870 --> 03:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
interest and dividends tax to
 
03:11:31.910 --> 03:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
distributions would simplify the message
 
03:11:33.950 --> 03:11:33.960 align:start position:0%
that this is only under distributions
 
03:11:35.990 --> 03:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
back to you just something to think
 
03:11:39.190 --> 03:11:39.200 align:start position:0%
about Mr Al thank you you bet thank you
 
03:11:42.870 --> 03:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
I hate the word distributions even more
 
03:11:46.389 --> 03:11:46.399 align:start position:0%
but I I know in talking with uh Lindsay
 
03:11:47.830 --> 03:11:47.840 align:start position:0%
step she said if if it ever comes back
 
03:11:49.070 --> 03:11:49.080 align:start position:0%
we're going to call it something totally
 
03:11:50.670 --> 03:11:50.680 align:start position:0%
different so let's keep all those
 
03:11:51.870 --> 03:11:51.880 align:start position:0%
thoughts going on what we're going to
 
03:11:53.229 --> 03:11:53.239 align:start position:0%
call it next time
 
03:11:56.630 --> 03:11:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:00.030 --> 03:12:00.040 align:start position:0%
you well nothing else okay thank you am
 
03:12:01.710 --> 03:12:01.720 align:start position:0%
I staying up here actually you are
 
03:12:05.389 --> 03:12:05.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:08.229 --> 03:12:08.239 align:start position:0%
be all right let's talk about bet a
 
03:12:11.269 --> 03:12:11.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:14.150 --> 03:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
bet you'll hear about in the context of
 
03:12:17.870 --> 03:12:17.880 align:start position:0%
how it works with B PT so we all know
 
03:12:21.190 --> 03:12:21.200 align:start position:0%
bet is business Enterprise tax which is
 
03:12:24.469 --> 03:12:24.479 align:start position:0%
a special tax on special items that a
 
03:12:26.710 --> 03:12:26.720 align:start position:0%
business has and we'll get a little bit
 
03:12:29.309 --> 03:12:29.319 align:start position:0%
more definition on on what business
 
03:12:32.510 --> 03:12:32.520 align:start position:0%
profits are and how it gets taxed but
 
03:12:34.630 --> 03:12:34.640 align:start position:0%
the two of them certainly work together
 
03:12:35.550 --> 03:12:35.560 align:start position:0%
and in
 
03:12:39.389 --> 03:12:39.399 align:start position:0%
1993 I was six years A New Hampshire
 
03:12:41.590 --> 03:12:41.600 align:start position:0%
resident and that's when all that came
 
03:12:44.349 --> 03:12:44.359 align:start position:0%
about so it was interesting to find out
 
03:12:47.710 --> 03:12:47.720 align:start position:0%
about bet and it was so it there was
 
03:12:50.070 --> 03:12:50.080 align:start position:0%
some thoughts about making business
 
03:12:53.030 --> 03:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
taxes in New Hampshire a fairer tax
 
03:12:56.750 --> 03:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
because at the time most um big
 
03:12:58.630 --> 03:12:58.640 align:start position:0%
companies public companies they had to
 
03:13:01.429 --> 03:13:01.439 align:start position:0%
leave net income behind there was some
 
03:13:03.469 --> 03:13:03.479 align:start position:0%
tax they were going to pay because they
 
03:13:05.070 --> 03:13:05.080 align:start position:0%
had to pay on the profits they had to
 
03:13:08.630 --> 03:13:08.640 align:start position:0%
keep and we as service people or other
 
03:13:10.750 --> 03:13:10.760 align:start position:0%
companies uh didn't have to pay any
 
03:13:12.630 --> 03:13:12.640 align:start position:0%
because all we did was we took all the
 
03:13:14.870 --> 03:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
money out so we had nothing left behind
 
03:13:17.269 --> 03:13:17.279 align:start position:0%
that we needed to leave to capitalize
 
03:13:19.590 --> 03:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
our companies with so it kind of became
 
03:13:22.389 --> 03:13:22.399 align:start position:0%
a business profits tax on big people
 
03:13:24.790 --> 03:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
everybody else paid nothing so I
 
03:13:27.269 --> 03:13:27.279 align:start position:0%
understand that that it came about it
 
03:13:29.950 --> 03:13:29.960 align:start position:0%
kind of made it a little more
 
03:13:33.349 --> 03:13:33.359 align:start position:0%
fair and in that twist was something
 
03:13:36.710 --> 03:13:36.720 align:start position:0%
called the deemed compensation deduction
 
03:13:38.950 --> 03:13:38.960 align:start position:0%
so for people who were smaller they
 
03:13:41.110 --> 03:13:41.120 align:start position:0%
could zero out their business profits
 
03:13:43.910 --> 03:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
tax if they can control it and pay zero
 
03:13:45.910 --> 03:13:45.920 align:start position:0%
tax and that's where the unfairness came
 
03:13:49.190 --> 03:13:49.200 align:start position:0%
about be came along and said look we're
 
03:13:51.030 --> 03:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
going to tax you on three components at
 
03:13:54.590 --> 03:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
a different rate so if you're a business
 
03:13:56.590 --> 03:13:56.600 align:start position:0%
you're going to measure your
 
03:13:58.750 --> 03:13:58.760 align:start position:0%
compensation deductions whether deemed
 
03:14:01.030 --> 03:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
or actual we're going to add in your
 
03:14:03.710 --> 03:14:03.720 align:start position:0%
interest expense and we're going to add
 
03:14:06.229 --> 03:14:06.239 align:start position:0%
in dividends that were paid out and
 
03:14:08.229 --> 03:14:08.239 align:start position:0%
we're going to add those three and we're
 
03:14:11.110 --> 03:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
going to tax it at a fairly low rate
 
03:14:15.469 --> 03:14:15.479 align:start position:0%
today that rate's now 0.55 of 1% so it's
 
03:14:18.790 --> 03:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
not a big tax but yet it kind of evens
 
03:14:21.349 --> 03:14:21.359 align:start position:0%
out you know businesses have good years
 
03:14:23.950 --> 03:14:23.960 align:start position:0%
and bad years and wages are a little bit
 
03:14:26.030 --> 03:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
more stable so it's been a good
 
03:14:29.190 --> 03:14:29.200 align:start position:0%
stabilization for for business tax in
 
03:14:31.469 --> 03:14:31.479 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that's that's what I my
 
03:14:33.349 --> 03:14:33.359 align:start position:0%
brain always says Stan Arnold always
 
03:14:36.229 --> 03:14:36.239 align:start position:0%
used to tell me that so those three
 
03:14:39.229 --> 03:14:39.239 align:start position:0%
components were important to figure out
 
03:14:41.790 --> 03:14:41.800 align:start position:0%
your bet the
 
03:14:44.870 --> 03:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
threshold for that bet tax has continued
 
03:14:49.670 --> 03:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
to go up it's now at 281,000 so it's a
 
03:14:53.150 --> 03:14:53.160 align:start position:0%
great tax in that it exempts real small
 
03:14:54.510 --> 03:14:54.520 align:start position:0%
businesses who shouldn't have to be
 
03:14:55.630 --> 03:14:55.640 align:start position:0%
paying a
 
03:14:57.910 --> 03:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
tax that's the positive about where
 
03:14:59.870 --> 03:14:59.880 align:start position:0%
you're where we're at right
 
03:15:02.670 --> 03:15:02.680 align:start position:0%
now the the good part about the business
 
03:15:05.110 --> 03:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
Enterprise tax is it's a credit against
 
03:15:07.990 --> 03:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
your business profits tax so companies
 
03:15:10.550 --> 03:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
don't end up paying both they end up
 
03:15:12.590 --> 03:15:12.600 align:start position:0%
figuring out their business profits tax
 
03:15:15.030 --> 03:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
their bet and in the end of the day
 
03:15:16.309 --> 03:15:16.319 align:start position:0%
they're going to pay the highest of the
 
03:15:19.309 --> 03:15:19.319 align:start position:0%
two but it's it's a formula based on
 
03:15:21.189 --> 03:15:21.199 align:start position:0%
here's your business profits tax take a
 
03:15:23.510 --> 03:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
credit for your bet and that's what you
 
03:15:26.910 --> 03:15:26.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:28.950 --> 03:15:28.960 align:start position:0%
liability uh let's see what else do we
 
03:15:30.110 --> 03:15:30.120 align:start position:0%
want to talk
 
03:15:32.469 --> 03:15:32.479 align:start position:0%
about there's been a couple other states
 
03:15:33.990 --> 03:15:34.000 align:start position:0%
that played around with an Enterprise
 
03:15:36.309 --> 03:15:36.319 align:start position:0%
tax I think most of them are gone New
 
03:15:37.830 --> 03:15:37.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's probably the only one now
 
03:15:40.429 --> 03:15:40.439 align:start position:0%
with a business Enterprise tax it makes
 
03:15:43.469 --> 03:15:43.479 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire a little bit unique and
 
03:15:45.389 --> 03:15:45.399 align:start position:0%
problematic all at the same time because
 
03:15:48.189 --> 03:15:48.199 align:start position:0%
you've got a tax that really no other
 
03:15:52.750 --> 03:15:52.760 align:start position:0%
State plays with so it's U it's more
 
03:15:55.110 --> 03:15:55.120 align:start position:0%
interesting for new companies coming in
 
03:15:57.630 --> 03:15:57.640 align:start position:0%
to learn about bet but as I said I think
 
03:16:00.910 --> 03:16:00.920 align:start position:0%
it's been good in in a way of keeping
 
03:16:03.110 --> 03:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
State revenues pretty
 
03:16:05.790 --> 03:16:05.800 align:start position:0%
consistent with within business cycles
 
03:16:07.189 --> 03:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
that go up and
 
03:16:10.750 --> 03:16:10.760 align:start position:0%
down there are other credits to
 
03:16:13.389 --> 03:16:13.399 align:start position:0%
bet there's the research and development
 
03:16:16.070 --> 03:16:16.080 align:start position:0%
tax credit which can be taken against
 
03:16:18.389 --> 03:16:18.399 align:start position:0%
bet the New Hampshire children's
 
03:16:21.189 --> 03:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund there's credits for
 
03:16:24.030 --> 03:16:24.040 align:start position:0%
funding CTE centers at high schools I
 
03:16:26.189 --> 03:16:26.199 align:start position:0%
think mostly there's the new family
 
03:16:27.670 --> 03:16:27.680 align:start position:0%
medical leave
 
03:16:30.550 --> 03:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
credits there's the insurance tax credit
 
03:16:32.349 --> 03:16:32.359 align:start position:0%
which a insurance company can take
 
03:16:34.110 --> 03:16:34.120 align:start position:0%
against their
 
03:16:37.150 --> 03:16:37.160 align:start position:0%
bet and cdfa credits and a bunch of
 
03:16:39.389 --> 03:16:39.399 align:start position:0%
others so there's things companies can
 
03:16:45.349 --> 03:16:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:48.269 --> 03:16:48.279 align:start position:0%
tax so just just a real quick and I
 
03:16:50.110 --> 03:16:50.120 align:start position:0%
might just make this really really quick
 
03:16:52.910 --> 03:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
let's say a business has 500,000 of
 
03:16:54.910 --> 03:16:54.920 align:start position:0%
revenues well first of all we know
 
03:16:57.630 --> 03:16:57.640 align:start position:0%
they're going to be subject to bet but
 
03:17:02.110 --> 03:17:02.120 align:start position:0%
their but if their business profits is
 
03:17:05.070 --> 03:17:05.080 align:start position:0%
100,000 they would otherwise have a be a
 
03:17:07.830 --> 03:17:07.840 align:start position:0%
BPT tax to
 
03:17:10.110 --> 03:17:10.120 align:start position:0%
pay if
 
03:17:13.510 --> 03:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
they're if that company is a single
 
03:17:17.309 --> 03:17:17.319 align:start position:0%
owner and he's left with that 100,000 of
 
03:17:20.550 --> 03:17:20.560 align:start position:0%
comp left over he's going to pay
 
03:17:23.910 --> 03:17:23.920 align:start position:0%
$550 to have that $100,000 compensation
 
03:17:27.030 --> 03:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
under bet assuming his BPT is probably
 
03:17:30.510 --> 03:17:30.520 align:start position:0%
nothing he's paying 550 for bet so it's
 
03:17:32.950 --> 03:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
not a bad tax and that's just kind of
 
03:17:35.670 --> 03:17:35.680 align:start position:0%
the way the formulas work for most small
 
03:17:38.110 --> 03:17:38.120 align:start position:0%
companies um and I think that's probably
 
03:17:40.510 --> 03:17:40.520 align:start position:0%
about all I really need to add about
 
03:17:42.830 --> 03:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
bet unless there's any questions I'd
 
03:17:44.830 --> 03:17:44.840 align:start position:0%
love to answer them thank you I see a
 
03:17:47.189 --> 03:17:47.199 align:start position:0%
coup representative Aly
 
03:17:54.269 --> 03:17:54.279 align:start position:0%
yes um it seems to me that since the PB
 
03:17:56.830 --> 03:17:56.840 align:start position:0%
the companies that do have to pay the
 
03:18:01.910 --> 03:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
BPT pay the BET first when we look at
 
03:18:03.950 --> 03:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
business profits tax what we're looking
 
03:18:09.429 --> 03:18:09.439 align:start position:0%
at is just the excess above the
 
03:18:13.630 --> 03:18:13.640 align:start position:0%
BET and so it kind of warps how we're
 
03:18:15.110 --> 03:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
03:18:17.309 --> 03:18:17.319 align:start position:0%
things so that's how you your revenue
 
03:18:21.389 --> 03:18:21.399 align:start position:0%
reports come out from Dr is BET and then
 
03:18:25.670 --> 03:18:25.680 align:start position:0%
all the additional stuff is the BPT
 
03:18:27.830 --> 03:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
yeah and I think most companies would
 
03:18:31.070 --> 03:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
look at bet as their sort of minimum tax
 
03:18:32.189 --> 03:18:32.199 align:start position:0%
right they're gonna they're never going
 
03:18:36.830 --> 03:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:41.429 --> 03:18:41.439 align:start position:0%
that thank you yes represent shamberg Mr
 
03:18:44.590 --> 03:18:44.600 align:start position:0%
Albright uh what would happen if there
 
03:18:46.950 --> 03:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
was just a
 
03:18:51.189 --> 03:18:51.199 align:start position:0%
not two taxes but just a one tax the BET
 
03:18:56.590 --> 03:18:56.600 align:start position:0%
tax to do away with the BPT you just had
 
03:18:59.790 --> 03:18:59.800 align:start position:0%
bet do you see a difference in the
 
03:19:01.389 --> 03:19:01.399 align:start position:0%
amount of Revenue the state would be
 
03:19:05.550 --> 03:19:05.560 align:start position:0%
getting or be us well I think you would
 
03:19:08.550 --> 03:19:08.560 align:start position:0%
be right because I think BPT is pretty
 
03:19:10.590 --> 03:19:10.600 align:start position:0%
well loaded up by large companies that
 
03:19:14.550 --> 03:19:14.560 align:start position:0%
work in in New Hampshire so you the
 
03:19:16.870 --> 03:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
interesting question would be maybe to
 
03:19:19.389 --> 03:19:19.399 align:start position:0%
Dr one of these days is what bet tax
 
03:19:22.229 --> 03:19:22.239 align:start position:0%
rate would it take to have the same
 
03:19:24.150 --> 03:19:24.160 align:start position:0%
revenues we're having from both taxes
 
03:19:25.910 --> 03:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
right now I suspect that's going to be a
 
03:19:25.920 --> 03:19:27.510 align:start position:0%
right now I suspect that's going to be a
pretty

03:19:27.510 --> 03:19:27.520 align:start position:0%
pretty
 
03:19:31.510 --> 03:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
high tax rate if it's 0.55 of a percent
 
03:19:31.520 --> 03:19:36.910 align:start position:0%
high tax rate if it's 0.55 of a percent
right

03:19:36.910 --> 03:19:36.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:41.229 --> 03:19:41.239 align:start position:0%
now represent Aly thank you if we had
 
03:19:42.870 --> 03:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
just a
 
03:19:46.670 --> 03:19:46.680 align:start position:0%
bet um there are quite a few business
 
03:19:48.950 --> 03:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
businesses with very few employees in
 
03:19:48.960 --> 03:19:50.309 align:start position:0%
businesses with very few employees in
the

03:19:50.309 --> 03:19:50.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:19:55.750 --> 03:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
state that have um very large
 
03:19:58.389 --> 03:19:58.399 align:start position:0%
revenue and they they would go Scott
 
03:19:58.399 --> 03:20:00.750 align:start position:0%
revenue and they they would go Scott
freak

03:20:00.750 --> 03:20:00.760 align:start position:0%
freak
 
03:20:03.309 --> 03:20:03.319 align:start position:0%
correct or
 
03:20:05.710 --> 03:20:05.720 align:start position:0%
almost you think they'd pay about the
 
03:20:08.670 --> 03:20:08.680 align:start position:0%
same I would think they'd pay less I
 
03:20:10.790 --> 03:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
would think so because bet is kind of a
 
03:20:13.990 --> 03:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
minimum amount mhm and so you'd lose a
 
03:20:15.990 --> 03:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
lot of BPT I don't think that would be
 
03:20:17.429 --> 03:20:17.439 align:start position:0%
good for state
 
03:20:20.229 --> 03:20:20.239 align:start position:0%
revenues yeah
 
03:20:22.349 --> 03:20:22.359 align:start position:0%
thanks represent
 
03:20:25.349 --> 03:20:25.359 align:start position:0%
Erie thank you Mr chair um thank you for
 
03:20:27.510 --> 03:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question when you're dealing
 
03:20:29.750 --> 03:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
with a new company moving into New
 
03:20:32.269 --> 03:20:32.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in a new environment to say
 
03:20:34.710 --> 03:20:34.720 align:start position:0%
someone who's used to New York or
 
03:20:37.670 --> 03:20:37.680 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts or places where we're
 
03:20:40.790 --> 03:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
aggressively recruiting right now when
 
03:20:43.710 --> 03:20:43.720 align:start position:0%
they see this bet
 
03:20:49.110 --> 03:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:51.510 --> 03:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
reaction interesting you know a lot of
 
03:20:54.189 --> 03:20:54.199 align:start position:0%
them come in because they think a lot of
 
03:20:56.030 --> 03:20:56.040 align:start position:0%
costs are going to be different and
 
03:20:58.189 --> 03:20:58.199 align:start position:0%
they're thinking their business tax will
 
03:21:00.910 --> 03:21:00.920 align:start position:0%
go down and I think that's probably
 
03:21:04.110 --> 03:21:04.120 align:start position:0%
true the the business profits tax rate
 
03:21:06.750 --> 03:21:06.760 align:start position:0%
right now is lower than more States than
 
03:21:09.150 --> 03:21:09.160 align:start position:0%
it was years ago that was part of our
 
03:21:11.309 --> 03:21:11.319 align:start position:0%
commission report so I think the rat's
 
03:21:14.110 --> 03:21:14.120 align:start position:0%
gone the right direction I think the
 
03:21:15.790 --> 03:21:15.800 align:start position:0%
only thing that most people don't like
 
03:21:17.229 --> 03:21:17.239 align:start position:0%
about bet
 
03:21:19.070 --> 03:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
is that if they're a startup and they're
 
03:21:20.990 --> 03:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
they know they've got four years of
 
03:21:23.870 --> 03:21:23.880 align:start position:0%
losing money they're paying a tax
 
03:21:27.070 --> 03:21:27.080 align:start position:0%
whereas if they just stayed in New York
 
03:21:28.590 --> 03:21:28.600 align:start position:0%
and and continued to have business
 
03:21:31.349 --> 03:21:31.359 align:start position:0%
losses they wouldn't pay anything so the
 
03:21:33.790 --> 03:21:33.800 align:start position:0%
Bett bet is probably the thing that's
 
03:21:36.750 --> 03:21:36.760 align:start position:0%
hardest for companies to get over but
 
03:21:38.309 --> 03:21:38.319 align:start position:0%
then you just talk to about the rate I
 
03:21:40.790 --> 03:21:40.800 align:start position:0%
mean a rate of less than 1% isn't going
 
03:21:44.229 --> 03:21:44.239 align:start position:0%
to be a lot of money to fuss about and
 
03:21:46.030 --> 03:21:46.040 align:start position:0%
that's what I try to get those clients
 
03:21:49.030 --> 03:21:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:51.750 --> 03:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
on thank you for taking my question
 
03:21:54.830 --> 03:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
represent ORS thank you Mr chair so
 
03:21:57.830 --> 03:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question uh a I
 
03:21:59.870 --> 03:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
was encouraged by the fact that you
 
03:22:01.830 --> 03:22:01.840 align:start position:0%
found the tax code
 
03:22:04.870 --> 03:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
complicated uh having done taxes in the
 
03:22:07.110 --> 03:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
past and being a former accountant and
 
03:22:08.750 --> 03:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
Robin I'm not
 
03:22:12.469 --> 03:22:12.479 align:start position:0%
interested uh is there a way to simplify
 
03:22:14.990 --> 03:22:15.000 align:start position:0%
some of the tax codes in your mind like
 
03:22:17.990 --> 03:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
let's just say the i d tax didn't go
 
03:22:21.590 --> 03:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
away uh how might you uh consider
 
03:22:23.550 --> 03:22:23.560 align:start position:0%
simplifying it and there there and the
 
03:22:25.590 --> 03:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
question's been asked really I was going
 
03:22:27.910 --> 03:22:27.920 align:start position:0%
to ask the similar question is how do we
 
03:22:30.710 --> 03:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
simplify what we have now between bet
 
03:22:30.720 --> 03:22:31.670 align:start position:0%
simplify what we have now between bet
and

03:22:31.670 --> 03:22:31.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:22:34.870 --> 03:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
BBT thank you yeah and if you if you can
 
03:22:37.349 --> 03:22:37.359 align:start position:0%
go to the libraries and find our 2014
 
03:22:39.309 --> 03:22:39.319 align:start position:0%
commission report you'd probably find it
 
03:22:41.349 --> 03:22:41.359 align:start position:0%
pretty interesting because it's still
 
03:22:43.269 --> 03:22:43.279 align:start position:0%
it's still pretty accurate today I think
 
03:22:44.510 --> 03:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
interest in
 
03:22:47.070 --> 03:22:47.080 align:start position:0%
dividends needed and this is in the
 
03:22:49.670 --> 03:22:49.680 align:start position:0%
report it needed to be focused just on
 
03:22:52.750 --> 03:22:52.760 align:start position:0%
those two items and not a world of other
 
03:22:55.429 --> 03:22:55.439 align:start position:0%
stuff and create an exemption that's
 
03:22:57.830 --> 03:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
high enough that gets rid of most of the
 
03:22:57.840 --> 03:22:58.750 align:start position:0%
high enough that gets rid of most of the
small

03:22:58.750 --> 03:22:58.760 align:start position:0%
small
 
03:23:01.750 --> 03:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
payers and I also think on business
 
03:23:05.110 --> 03:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
profits and business Enterprise taxes
 
03:23:06.990 --> 03:23:07.000 align:start position:0%
those thresholds have going up so
 
03:23:09.229 --> 03:23:09.239 align:start position:0%
they've been sort of helping to keep
 
03:23:11.830 --> 03:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
small businesses from having to do those
 
03:23:14.150 --> 03:23:14.160 align:start position:0%
reports and I think those are two of the
 
03:23:15.790 --> 03:23:15.800 align:start position:0%
greatest things that's happened over the
 
03:23:19.110 --> 03:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
years with our business taxes I I think
 
03:23:21.630 --> 03:23:21.640 align:start position:0%
all businesses expect to pay when they
 
03:23:23.910 --> 03:23:23.920 align:start position:0%
come to New Hampshire and I don't hear a
 
03:23:25.309 --> 03:23:25.319 align:start position:0%
lot of companies
 
03:23:28.870 --> 03:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
complaining you know the rates are
 
03:23:32.469 --> 03:23:32.479 align:start position:0%
lower I think the more that we could
 
03:23:35.710 --> 03:23:35.720 align:start position:0%
sync our tax code with the IRS code
 
03:23:38.309 --> 03:23:38.319 align:start position:0%
would be something that would be always
 
03:23:38.319 --> 03:23:39.950 align:start position:0%
would be something that would be always
worth

03:23:39.950 --> 03:23:39.960 align:start position:0%
worth
 
03:23:42.349 --> 03:23:42.359 align:start position:0%
studying because that certainly helps it
 
03:23:49.910 --> 03:23:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:49.920 --> 03:23:53.830 align:start position:0%
 
thank

03:23:53.830 --> 03:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:57.070 --> 03:23:57.080 align:start position:0%
yesi I was struck a couple of years ago
 
03:24:00.429 --> 03:24:00.439 align:start position:0%
when the the man who was head of the Bia
 
03:24:03.510 --> 03:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
was still head I think it was his last
 
03:24:08.349 --> 03:24:08.359 align:start position:0%
Terah um he because we were still P sort
 
03:24:11.990 --> 03:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
of in the pandemic he put together a
 
03:24:14.910 --> 03:24:14.920 align:start position:0%
remote uh Bia
 
03:24:18.229 --> 03:24:18.239 align:start position:0%
presentation and he personally
 
03:24:24.950 --> 03:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
arranged a um interview of three heads
 
03:24:28.710 --> 03:24:28.720 align:start position:0%
of uh business one of them fairly small
 
03:24:30.990 --> 03:24:31.000 align:start position:0%
one of them fairly large ones the beer
 
03:24:35.510 --> 03:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
one in the middle sort of I think um and
 
03:24:37.550 --> 03:24:37.560 align:start position:0%
after he'd asked them a number of
 
03:24:40.309 --> 03:24:40.319 align:start position:0%
leading questions they didn't uh say
 
03:24:43.510 --> 03:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
anything about taxes and so he finally
 
03:24:48.309 --> 03:24:48.319 align:start position:0%
asked them on what your opinion of our
 
03:24:52.469 --> 03:24:52.479 align:start position:0%
taxes and two of them said
 
03:24:54.870 --> 03:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
that I don't know
 
03:24:58.790 --> 03:24:58.800 align:start position:0%
no uh said we don't know anything about
 
03:25:01.150 --> 03:25:01.160 align:start position:0%
our taxes the accountant gives it to us
 
03:25:02.469 --> 03:25:02.479 align:start position:0%
and we sign
 
03:25:05.389 --> 03:25:05.399 align:start position:0%
it and the third one didn't say
 
03:25:10.189 --> 03:25:10.199 align:start position:0%
anything so is this
 
03:25:12.429 --> 03:25:12.439 align:start position:0%
normal yeah I think so because like I
 
03:25:14.670 --> 03:25:14.680 align:start position:0%
said a minute ago it's the expectation
 
03:25:16.670 --> 03:25:16.680 align:start position:0%
you're going to pay something and I
 
03:25:18.510 --> 03:25:18.520 align:start position:0%
think most people understand New
 
03:25:20.710 --> 03:25:20.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is just unique right we're
 
03:25:22.110 --> 03:25:22.120 align:start position:0%
gonna have our own Solutions we're going
 
03:25:24.269 --> 03:25:24.279 align:start position:0%
to figure out our own way and I think
 
03:25:26.590 --> 03:25:26.600 align:start position:0%
most people just understand that when
 
03:25:29.070 --> 03:25:29.080 align:start position:0%
they come that they're going to pay less
 
03:25:35.070 --> 03:25:35.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:38.349 --> 03:25:38.359 align:start position:0%
different okay thank you Joel you bet
 
03:25:42.229 --> 03:25:42.239 align:start position:0%
save some questions for
 
03:25:51.670 --> 03:25:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:53.269 --> 03:25:53.279 align:start position:0%
hello everybody thank you for having me
 
03:25:54.750 --> 03:25:54.760 align:start position:0%
here today along with the rest of the
 
03:25:57.429 --> 03:25:57.439 align:start position:0%
group so my task is to talk about the
 
03:25:59.309 --> 03:25:59.319 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire business profits tax and
 
03:26:01.030 --> 03:26:01.040 align:start position:0%
somehow squeeze all of that into 10
 
03:26:02.990 --> 03:26:03.000 align:start position:0%
minutes so we're going to do what we can
 
03:26:04.550 --> 03:26:04.560 align:start position:0%
we'll touch it at all at a high level
 
03:26:06.670 --> 03:26:06.680 align:start position:0%
and of course any follow-up questions
 
03:26:09.030 --> 03:26:09.040 align:start position:0%
we're happy to take them um so the New
 
03:26:10.950 --> 03:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire business profit sax is the
 
03:26:12.510 --> 03:26:12.520 align:start position:0%
other half of what Joel was talking
 
03:26:14.790 --> 03:26:14.800 align:start position:0%
about so our two-part tax system for
 
03:26:17.070 --> 03:26:17.080 align:start position:0%
businesses the business center prise tax
 
03:26:19.309 --> 03:26:19.319 align:start position:0%
the business profits tax and work hand
 
03:26:21.070 --> 03:26:21.080 align:start position:0%
in hand as Joel mentioned you get that
 
03:26:22.790 --> 03:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
credit for those business Enterprise
 
03:26:25.429 --> 03:26:25.439 align:start position:0%
taxes paid against the business profits
 
03:26:28.790 --> 03:26:28.800 align:start position:0%
tax and the business profits tax is
 
03:26:30.910 --> 03:26:30.920 align:start position:0%
really a more traditional income tax so
 
03:26:32.710 --> 03:26:32.720 align:start position:0%
we're looking at a seven and a half%
 
03:26:35.910 --> 03:26:35.920 align:start position:0%
rate on the net business uh on the net
 
03:26:38.110 --> 03:26:38.120 align:start position:0%
profits of the business so really what
 
03:26:39.790 --> 03:26:39.800 align:start position:0%
I'm going to walk through today so how
 
03:26:42.030 --> 03:26:42.040 align:start position:0%
do we actually calculate what those net
 
03:26:44.309 --> 03:26:44.319 align:start position:0%
profits for that business are all right
 
03:26:46.110 --> 03:26:46.120 align:start position:0%
so we really just start off with well
 
03:26:47.870 --> 03:26:47.880 align:start position:0%
what what's Federal taxable income
 
03:26:49.950 --> 03:26:49.960 align:start position:0%
whether that could be the federal
 
03:26:52.429 --> 03:26:52.439 align:start position:0%
taxable income as a C corporation S
 
03:26:54.670 --> 03:26:54.680 align:start position:0%
corporation partnership or a sole
 
03:26:57.189 --> 03:26:57.199 align:start position:0%
proprietorship being picked up on their
 
03:26:59.269 --> 03:26:59.279 align:start position:0%
personal income tax return is Schedule C
 
03:27:02.790 --> 03:27:02.800 align:start position:0%
schedule e um and then just due to
 
03:27:04.790 --> 03:27:04.800 align:start position:0%
differences between New Hampshire tax
 
03:27:06.630 --> 03:27:06.640 align:start position:0%
law and federal tax law there's a series
 
03:27:09.150 --> 03:27:09.160 align:start position:0%
of adjustments that end up being made to
 
03:27:10.870 --> 03:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
arrive at the amount of income that will
 
03:27:15.750 --> 03:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
be subject to that 75% tax so first what
 
03:27:17.950 --> 03:27:17.960 align:start position:0%
what I want to touch on and Joel had
 
03:27:20.389 --> 03:27:20.399 align:start position:0%
talked about this briefly as well is
 
03:27:21.910 --> 03:27:21.920 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire compensation
 
03:27:24.150 --> 03:27:24.160 align:start position:0%
deduction which really applies to
 
03:27:27.349 --> 03:27:27.359 align:start position:0%
non-corporate entities um so those the
 
03:27:29.870 --> 03:27:29.880 align:start position:0%
llc's taxes Partnerships General
 
03:27:31.469 --> 03:27:31.479 align:start position:0%
Partnerships sole
 
03:27:34.469 --> 03:27:34.479 align:start position:0%
proprietorships um all of those types of
 
03:27:36.630 --> 03:27:36.640 align:start position:0%
businesses and what this deduction is I
 
03:27:38.150 --> 03:27:38.160 align:start position:0%
mean I hate to call it a phantom
 
03:27:39.870 --> 03:27:39.880 align:start position:0%
deduction but you know whether it's
 
03:27:42.590 --> 03:27:42.600 align:start position:0%
amounts paid out of the business or
 
03:27:44.110 --> 03:27:44.120 align:start position:0%
deemed amounts to be paid out of the
 
03:27:46.710 --> 03:27:46.720 align:start position:0%
business it's it's in recognition of the
 
03:27:50.189 --> 03:27:50.199 align:start position:0%
services provided by the members of that
 
03:27:52.590 --> 03:27:52.600 align:start position:0%
organization um so when you look at a C
 
03:27:54.349 --> 03:27:54.359 align:start position:0%
Corp S corporation they're allowed to
 
03:27:57.510 --> 03:27:57.520 align:start position:0%
take deductions for wages paid to their
 
03:28:00.070 --> 03:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
service to service providing members so
 
03:28:01.710 --> 03:28:01.720 align:start position:0%
you know the owner of a C Corp does a
 
03:28:03.389 --> 03:28:03.399 align:start position:0%
bunch of work for that C Corp they
 
03:28:05.590 --> 03:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
receive a W2 for their efforts well
 
03:28:07.429 --> 03:28:07.439 align:start position:0%
that's deductible in arriving at federal
 
03:28:09.510 --> 03:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
income and at New Hampshire taxable
 
03:28:12.269 --> 03:28:12.279 align:start position:0%
income the sole proprietor partnership
 
03:28:14.070 --> 03:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't have that same write-off so this
 
03:28:18.590 --> 03:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
is an equalizer and a effect um I think
 
03:28:20.389 --> 03:28:20.399 align:start position:0%
what really starts to become the fuzzy
 
03:28:21.710 --> 03:28:21.720 align:start position:0%
math when it comes to New Hampshire is
 
03:28:23.670 --> 03:28:23.680 align:start position:0%
like well what is that compensation
 
03:28:26.670 --> 03:28:26.680 align:start position:0%
deduction is in the end that when you
 
03:28:29.070 --> 03:28:29.080 align:start position:0%
review the rules it it discusses that
 
03:28:31.269 --> 03:28:31.279 align:start position:0%
it's um a reasonable payment for the
 
03:28:33.670 --> 03:28:33.680 align:start position:0%
services provided by the member well
 
03:28:36.590 --> 03:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
what's reasonable when we look it points
 
03:28:39.790 --> 03:28:39.800 align:start position:0%
to Federal rules related to reasonable
 
03:28:42.630 --> 03:28:42.640 align:start position:0%
compensation for C corporations which is
 
03:28:45.830 --> 03:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
extremely broad so in in that regard a
 
03:28:48.070 --> 03:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
lot many companies can be very
 
03:28:50.550 --> 03:28:50.560 align:start position:0%
aggressive with those compensation
 
03:28:53.030 --> 03:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
deductions um within within the letter
 
03:28:53.950 --> 03:28:53.960 align:start position:0%
of the
 
03:28:58.670 --> 03:28:58.680 align:start position:0%
law and and I so those taxpayers they
 
03:29:02.349 --> 03:29:02.359 align:start position:0%
need to be able to um justify that by
 
03:29:04.070 --> 03:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
with through their own record keeping so
 
03:29:07.110 --> 03:29:07.120 align:start position:0%
that on an annual basis they should with
 
03:29:08.710 --> 03:29:08.720 align:start position:0%
you in coordination with their tax
 
03:29:10.429 --> 03:29:10.439 align:start position:0%
prepare usually determine right well
 
03:29:12.189 --> 03:29:12.199 align:start position:0%
what is that reasonable compensation
 
03:29:14.469 --> 03:29:14.479 align:start position:0%
number let's document how we arrived at
 
03:29:16.510 --> 03:29:16.520 align:start position:0%
that number May it's based on hours
 
03:29:18.150 --> 03:29:18.160 align:start position:0%
worked maybe it's based on the types of
 
03:29:21.750 --> 03:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
services provided whatever it might be
 
03:29:24.590 --> 03:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
um and and then take that deduction on
 
03:29:26.429 --> 03:29:26.439 align:start position:0%
the return the the flip side is the
 
03:29:29.189 --> 03:29:29.199 align:start position:0%
option to take a safe harbor uh
 
03:29:30.950 --> 03:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
compensation deduction which right now
 
03:29:33.389 --> 03:29:33.399 align:start position:0%
under New Hampshire statute is
 
03:29:36.990 --> 03:29:37.000 align:start position:0%
$75,000 uh for an entity so if you you
 
03:29:39.670 --> 03:29:39.680 align:start position:0%
can take that deduction up to 75,000 you
 
03:29:41.229 --> 03:29:41.239 align:start position:0%
don't have to have to have any
 
03:29:43.630 --> 03:29:43.640 align:start position:0%
recordkeeping as to how much you took
 
03:29:46.790 --> 03:29:46.800 align:start position:0%
for that compensation deduction and say
 
03:29:48.750 --> 03:29:48.760 align:start position:0%
a little bit of legislative history
 
03:29:52.070 --> 03:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
there as a as a it was the last session
 
03:29:54.670 --> 03:29:54.680 align:start position:0%
um there was proposals and there's been
 
03:29:56.750 --> 03:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
proposals in the past as well to raise
 
03:29:59.070 --> 03:29:59.080 align:start position:0%
that Safe Harbor so that
 
03:30:02.750 --> 03:30:02.760 align:start position:0%
$75,000 was set well over a decade ago
 
03:30:05.710 --> 03:30:05.720 align:start position:0%
now with no index for inflation so it's
 
03:30:07.590 --> 03:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
just been as we know there's certainly
 
03:30:09.429 --> 03:30:09.439 align:start position:0%
been an inflationary environment the
 
03:30:12.830 --> 03:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
last few years um believe that proposal
 
03:30:15.269 --> 03:30:15.279 align:start position:0%
last sum around was to bring that Safe
 
03:30:18.269 --> 03:30:18.279 align:start position:0%
Harbor deduction it was around1 $110,000
 
03:30:20.510 --> 03:30:20.520 align:start position:0%
I don't recall the exact amount but then
 
03:30:22.710 --> 03:30:22.720 align:start position:0%
even further index it for inflation so
 
03:30:24.710 --> 03:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
they don't run into that same issue on a
 
03:30:29.510 --> 03:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
go forward basis um so looking beyond
 
03:30:32.269 --> 03:30:32.279 align:start position:0%
that compensation
 
03:30:32.279 --> 03:30:34.510 align:start position:0%
that compensation
deduction

03:30:34.510 --> 03:30:34.520 align:start position:0%
deduction
 
03:30:37.550 --> 03:30:37.560 align:start position:0%
we're we're looking at other adjustments
 
03:30:42.269 --> 03:30:42.279 align:start position:0%
to ring from federal income down to uh
 
03:30:43.510 --> 03:30:43.520 align:start position:0%
what's taxable for New Hampshire
 
03:30:46.150 --> 03:30:46.160 align:start position:0%
business profits um so one of the the
 
03:30:48.189 --> 03:30:48.199 align:start position:0%
most one of the primary ones that almost
 
03:30:50.429 --> 03:30:50.439 align:start position:0%
all businesses see is adjustments for
 
03:30:53.189 --> 03:30:53.199 align:start position:0%
depreciation items and that comes out to
 
03:30:55.189 --> 03:30:55.199 align:start position:0%
so well in Hampshire says well you
 
03:30:57.070 --> 03:30:57.080 align:start position:0%
cannot take bonus depreciation like you
 
03:30:58.790 --> 03:30:58.800 align:start position:0%
can federally and we have a different
 
03:31:01.429 --> 03:31:01.439 align:start position:0%
number uh maximum amount that you can
 
03:31:04.910 --> 03:31:04.920 align:start position:0%
expense under Section 179 than you can
 
03:31:07.790 --> 03:31:07.800 align:start position:0%
for federal purposes so New Hampshire
 
03:31:09.030 --> 03:31:09.040 align:start position:0%
says all right well you took all those
 
03:31:11.070 --> 03:31:11.080 align:start position:0%
deductions for federal purposes well you
 
03:31:12.710 --> 03:31:12.720 align:start position:0%
need to add those back for State of New
 
03:31:14.830 --> 03:31:14.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire purposes but then you still
 
03:31:16.790 --> 03:31:16.800 align:start position:0%
get to depreciate the those items over
 
03:31:18.990 --> 03:31:19.000 align:start position:0%
their useful life so say something has a
 
03:31:21.990 --> 03:31:22.000 align:start position:0%
useful life of 5 years when maybe
 
03:31:23.590 --> 03:31:23.600 align:start position:0%
federally someone was able to write it
 
03:31:25.349 --> 03:31:25.359 align:start position:0%
off all in year one and New Hampshire
 
03:31:27.550 --> 03:31:27.560 align:start position:0%
gets written off over five years so by
 
03:31:29.030 --> 03:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
the time you get to the end of the life
 
03:31:31.189 --> 03:31:31.199 align:start position:0%
of that asset you've taken the same
 
03:31:33.030 --> 03:31:33.040 align:start position:0%
deduction for both Federal and New
 
03:31:33.040 --> 03:31:34.309 align:start position:0%
deduction for both Federal and New
Hampshire

03:31:34.309 --> 03:31:34.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
03:31:37.590 --> 03:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
purposes exactly yeah and that's a very
 
03:31:39.269 --> 03:31:39.279 align:start position:0%
i' say that's a very common difference
 
03:31:42.269 --> 03:31:42.279 align:start position:0%
too and you look at across the country
 
03:31:44.309 --> 03:31:44.319 align:start position:0%
it it is very common that states will
 
03:31:46.510 --> 03:31:46.520 align:start position:0%
have completely different rules as it as
 
03:31:49.590 --> 03:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
it goes to bonus depreciation or Section
 
03:31:51.710 --> 03:31:51.720 align:start position:0%
179 so that's that's a very normal thing
 
03:31:55.189 --> 03:31:55.199 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire has um another common
 
03:31:56.910 --> 03:31:56.920 align:start position:0%
one that I end up seeing with with my
 
03:31:58.910 --> 03:31:58.920 align:start position:0%
client base is separate entity deduction
 
03:32:00.550 --> 03:32:00.560 align:start position:0%
which just goes into some of how New
 
03:32:03.670 --> 03:32:03.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire addresses Taxation and that is
 
03:32:08.309 --> 03:32:08.319 align:start position:0%
looking at each LLC each each entity as
 
03:32:10.349 --> 03:32:10.359 align:start position:0%
a separate entity for New Hampshire
 
03:32:13.710 --> 03:32:13.720 align:start position:0%
state tax purposes this actually is a
 
03:32:15.630 --> 03:32:15.640 align:start position:0%
Divergence from how it might be dealt
 
03:32:18.510 --> 03:32:18.520 align:start position:0%
with at the federal level where you know
 
03:32:20.710 --> 03:32:20.720 align:start position:0%
they commedy in in my world you great
 
03:32:22.189 --> 03:32:22.199 align:start position:0%
majority of my clients are in that are
 
03:32:25.110 --> 03:32:25.120 align:start position:0%
in the real estate space so if you have
 
03:32:27.550 --> 03:32:27.560 align:start position:0%
someone who has a holding company and
 
03:32:29.910 --> 03:32:29.920 align:start position:0%
then they have 20 llc's wholly owned by
 
03:32:32.510 --> 03:32:32.520 align:start position:0%
that holding company so for federally
 
03:32:35.070 --> 03:32:35.080 align:start position:0%
they just have a single tax return for
 
03:32:36.910 --> 03:32:36.920 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire purposes
 
03:32:39.269 --> 03:32:39.279 align:start position:0%
potentially they have 20 separate or 21
 
03:32:40.790 --> 03:32:40.800 align:start position:0%
separate New Hampshire tax returns that
 
03:32:43.349 --> 03:32:43.359 align:start position:0%
they need to file um but also that
 
03:32:45.910 --> 03:32:45.920 align:start position:0%
separate entity deduction applies to if
 
03:32:48.269 --> 03:32:48.279 align:start position:0%
you have flow through you know say that
 
03:32:50.550 --> 03:32:50.560 align:start position:0%
you have an investment in a partnership
 
03:32:52.550 --> 03:32:52.560 align:start position:0%
that throws off a K1 well that
 
03:32:54.030 --> 03:32:54.040 align:start position:0%
partnership might already be subject to
 
03:32:56.910 --> 03:32:56.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire taxation so your next up
 
03:32:58.349 --> 03:32:58.359 align:start position:0%
level you shouldn't be subject to it
 
03:33:00.229 --> 03:33:00.239 align:start position:0%
again so again you get to back that out
 
03:33:02.630 --> 03:33:02.640 align:start position:0%
separate entity so just so each entity
 
03:33:04.670 --> 03:33:04.680 align:start position:0%
is dealt with in its own Silo for New
 
03:33:07.070 --> 03:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire tax purposes there's combined
 
03:33:08.750 --> 03:33:08.760 align:start position:0%
filing requirements which can be
 
03:33:10.950 --> 03:33:10.960 align:start position:0%
triggered which I think Kevin's going to
 
03:33:13.389 --> 03:33:13.399 align:start position:0%
talk about at least briefly but you know
 
03:33:15.389 --> 03:33:15.399 align:start position:0%
for someone who's operating wholly in
 
03:33:17.189 --> 03:33:17.199 align:start position:0%
within the State of New Hampshire that's
 
03:33:18.710 --> 03:33:18.720 align:start position:0%
a general environment that they're
 
03:33:21.389 --> 03:33:21.399 align:start position:0%
working in there's a number of other
 
03:33:24.150 --> 03:33:24.160 align:start position:0%
smaller adjustments that we see uh not
 
03:33:26.189 --> 03:33:26.199 align:start position:0%
quite as commonly but depends on the
 
03:33:28.309 --> 03:33:28.319 align:start position:0%
activity of the taxpayer um like
 
03:33:30.670 --> 03:33:30.680 align:start position:0%
interest income from us obligations
 
03:33:35.229 --> 03:33:35.239 align:start position:0%
bonds um treasury oh sorry you know
 
03:33:37.269 --> 03:33:37.279 align:start position:0%
interest and dividend income that was
 
03:33:40.030 --> 03:33:40.040 align:start position:0%
well subject to the indd tax so that'll
 
03:33:43.389 --> 03:33:43.399 align:start position:0%
be something that's going away um and
 
03:33:46.070 --> 03:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
then adjustments related to Federal BAS
 
03:33:48.670 --> 03:33:48.680 align:start position:0%
adjustments so you know one one person
 
03:33:50.309 --> 03:33:50.319 align:start position:0%
buys another person's partnership
 
03:33:52.750 --> 03:33:52.760 align:start position:0%
interest to buy into a partnership well
 
03:33:55.030 --> 03:33:55.040 align:start position:0%
federally there's a step up in the basis
 
03:33:57.309 --> 03:33:57.319 align:start position:0%
of the assets for that purchase and they
 
03:33:59.910 --> 03:33:59.920 align:start position:0%
get to depreciate that step up New
 
03:34:01.150 --> 03:34:01.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has different rules
 
03:34:04.189 --> 03:34:04.199 align:start position:0%
surrounding that so we won't get into th
 
03:34:06.349 --> 03:34:06.359 align:start position:0%
those those those complexities but
 
03:34:07.469 --> 03:34:07.479 align:start position:0%
typically there ends up being a
 
03:34:09.670 --> 03:34:09.680 align:start position:0%
difference where often times that step
 
03:34:11.750 --> 03:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
up is not taken for New Hampshire tax
 
03:34:13.030 --> 03:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
purposes and they don't get that
 
03:34:16.030 --> 03:34:16.040 align:start position:0%
somewhere depreciation right off uh
 
03:34:19.030 --> 03:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
going a little bit further down um and
 
03:34:20.710 --> 03:34:20.720 align:start position:0%
next item on your bullet point list
 
03:34:23.670 --> 03:34:23.680 align:start position:0%
there's the net operating loss deduction
 
03:34:25.070 --> 03:34:25.080 align:start position:0%
so this is in recognition it's like all
 
03:34:26.670 --> 03:34:26.680 align:start position:0%
right well sometimes it doesn't go so
 
03:34:30.150 --> 03:34:30.160 align:start position:0%
well the business loses money and what
 
03:34:32.150 --> 03:34:32.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire allows is that those
 
03:34:34.550 --> 03:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
losses can be carried forward up to 10
 
03:34:38.590 --> 03:34:38.600 align:start position:0%
years and offset uh business profits in
 
03:34:42.870 --> 03:34:42.880 align:start position:0%
future years any one any annual loss is
 
03:34:44.750 --> 03:34:44.760 align:start position:0%
limited to 10 million so say someone has
 
03:34:46.750 --> 03:34:46.760 align:start position:0%
a loss of 12 well they can only carry
 
03:34:49.070 --> 03:34:49.080 align:start position:0%
forward 10
 
03:34:49.080 --> 03:34:50.670 align:start position:0%
forward 10
um

03:34:50.670 --> 03:34:50.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:34:53.790 --> 03:34:53.800 align:start position:0%
and it's I think the NL is also
 
03:34:55.150 --> 03:34:55.160 align:start position:0%
something that kind of highlights a
 
03:34:57.269 --> 03:34:57.279 align:start position:0%
legislative success over the last few
 
03:34:59.429 --> 03:34:59.439 align:start position:0%
years and what used to be the case for
 
03:35:02.070 --> 03:35:02.080 align:start position:0%
the NL is it was subject to double
 
03:35:03.910 --> 03:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
apportionment and this really just
 
03:35:05.790 --> 03:35:05.800 align:start position:0%
impacted those taxpayers who were doing
 
03:35:07.990 --> 03:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
business inside and outside of New
 
03:35:09.469 --> 03:35:09.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so they had divide up their
 
03:35:12.389 --> 03:35:12.399 align:start position:0%
income based on an apportionment formula
 
03:35:14.110 --> 03:35:14.120 align:start position:0%
um to determine how much of that income
 
03:35:16.670 --> 03:35:16.680 align:start position:0%
is subject to tax in the state
 
03:35:19.950 --> 03:35:19.960 align:start position:0%
so the way that the rules worked before
 
03:35:22.590 --> 03:35:22.600 align:start position:0%
the year that you incurred that loss you
 
03:35:25.389 --> 03:35:25.399 align:start position:0%
a portioned it based on the current year
 
03:35:28.429 --> 03:35:28.439 align:start position:0%
percentage and then in the year that you
 
03:35:30.750 --> 03:35:30.760 align:start position:0%
utilize that loss to offset income it
 
03:35:32.469 --> 03:35:32.479 align:start position:0%
effectively end up being apportioned a
 
03:35:35.950 --> 03:35:35.960 align:start position:0%
second time so in that world like say
 
03:35:37.910 --> 03:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
you had a taxpayer who had a million
 
03:35:40.269 --> 03:35:40.279 align:start position:0%
dollar loss in year one and a million
 
03:35:42.349 --> 03:35:42.359 align:start position:0%
dollars of income Year too and let's say
 
03:35:44.510 --> 03:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
50% of their business occurred in the
 
03:35:46.830 --> 03:35:46.840 align:start position:0%
state um in both
 
03:35:50.790 --> 03:35:50.800 align:start position:0%
years so under the old rules once you
 
03:35:52.750 --> 03:35:52.760 align:start position:0%
end up go going through all of it I'll
 
03:35:54.670 --> 03:35:54.680 align:start position:0%
save you walking through all the math
 
03:35:56.990 --> 03:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
but that taxpayer between year one and
 
03:35:59.630 --> 03:35:59.640 align:start position:0%
year two ends up subject to tax on
 
03:36:01.670 --> 03:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
$250,000 to the New Hampshire business
 
03:36:04.150 --> 03:36:04.160 align:start position:0%
profits tax well that's what's that's
 
03:36:06.790 --> 03:36:06.800 align:start position:0%
the income subject to the tax that's
 
03:36:08.389 --> 03:36:08.399 align:start position:0%
kind of counterintuitive when you say
 
03:36:10.349 --> 03:36:10.359 align:start position:0%
wait I made I lost a million I made a
 
03:36:12.550 --> 03:36:12.560 align:start position:0%
million shouldn't I be a break even well
 
03:36:14.710 --> 03:36:14.720 align:start position:0%
that's not how the old old rules worked
 
03:36:16.950 --> 03:36:16.960 align:start position:0%
but that's how they work on a go forward
 
03:36:20.110 --> 03:36:20.120 align:start position:0%
basis so that was that was a good
 
03:36:22.990 --> 03:36:23.000 align:start position:0%
win so then once we get through all of
 
03:36:24.790 --> 03:36:24.800 align:start position:0%
that all right we we've made our
 
03:36:26.710 --> 03:36:26.720 align:start position:0%
adjustments we've taken out our net
 
03:36:29.229 --> 03:36:29.239 align:start position:0%
operating losses and then we assess the
 
03:36:32.510 --> 03:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
tax at 7 and a half% and we aren't quite
 
03:36:34.229 --> 03:36:34.239 align:start position:0%
done yet because we get to apply all of
 
03:36:37.269 --> 03:36:37.279 align:start position:0%
our credits um so Joel mentioned a
 
03:36:39.870 --> 03:36:39.880 align:start position:0%
number of these already the R&amp;D tax
 
03:36:41.590 --> 03:36:41.600 align:start position:0%
credit is a is a pretty common one
 
03:36:44.510 --> 03:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
depending on on uh the business clients
 
03:36:46.670 --> 03:36:46.680 align:start position:0%
are in which is really based on a
 
03:36:49.510 --> 03:36:49.520 align:start position:0%
portion of the federal R&amp;D credit
 
03:36:52.269 --> 03:36:52.279 align:start position:0%
expenses that a taxpayer takes uh
 
03:36:55.510 --> 03:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
education tax credits um Career and
 
03:36:58.870 --> 03:36:58.880 align:start position:0%
Technical Training tax credits uh cdfa a
 
03:37:00.710 --> 03:37:00.720 align:start position:0%
lot of these credits are based on a
 
03:37:03.750 --> 03:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
qualified contributions to specific
 
03:37:05.550 --> 03:37:05.560 align:start position:0%
programs whether it's a designated
 
03:37:07.990 --> 03:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
program by you the cdfa Community
 
03:37:11.750 --> 03:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
Development uh Finance Administration um
 
03:37:14.510 --> 03:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
or specifically by the state a chosen
 
03:37:16.710 --> 03:37:16.720 align:start position:0%
project there's a few others out there
 
03:37:19.189 --> 03:37:19.199 align:start position:0%
that I I don't deal with quite as often
 
03:37:21.389 --> 03:37:21.399 align:start position:0%
in my world of real estate but the Coos
 
03:37:24.189 --> 03:37:24.199 align:start position:0%
County credits Paid Family a medical
 
03:37:29.150 --> 03:37:29.160 align:start position:0%
leave um erz insurance premiums and then
 
03:37:30.830 --> 03:37:30.840 align:start position:0%
as Joel mentioned those business
 
03:37:33.630 --> 03:37:33.640 align:start position:0%
Enterprise tax credits which is just a
 
03:37:35.630 --> 03:37:35.640 align:start position:0%
dollar Ford dooll Credit for anything
 
03:37:37.469 --> 03:37:37.479 align:start position:0%
you had paid in business Enterprise
 
03:37:40.070 --> 03:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
taxes and just to further a little bit
 
03:37:41.990 --> 03:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
of what Joel said when you pay those
 
03:37:44.870 --> 03:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
business Enterprise tax taxes and say in
 
03:37:46.429 --> 03:37:46.439 align:start position:0%
a year you didn't have any business
 
03:37:48.830 --> 03:37:48.840 align:start position:0%
profits tax you were operating at a loss
 
03:37:51.469 --> 03:37:51.479 align:start position:0%
or your business profits tax was small
 
03:37:53.150 --> 03:37:53.160 align:start position:0%
enough that your Enterprise tax was
 
03:37:56.110 --> 03:37:56.120 align:start position:0%
actually larger those excess business
 
03:37:57.950 --> 03:37:57.960 align:start position:0%
Enterprise tax credits that you weren't
 
03:38:00.070 --> 03:38:00.080 align:start position:0%
able to use against your BBT carry
 
03:38:02.469 --> 03:38:02.479 align:start position:0%
forward for up to 10 years so you have
 
03:38:03.870 --> 03:38:03.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity to use them in a more
 
03:38:03.880 --> 03:38:04.910 align:start position:0%
opportunity to use them in a more
profitable

03:38:04.910 --> 03:38:04.920 align:start position:0%
profitable
 
03:38:07.349 --> 03:38:07.359 align:start position:0%
year right so that's all I have on
 
03:38:09.269 --> 03:38:09.279 align:start position:0%
business profits tax a whirlwind through
 
03:38:12.710 --> 03:38:12.720 align:start position:0%
it so stop here and see what questions
 
03:38:16.030 --> 03:38:16.040 align:start position:0%
we may have do we have any questions yes
 
03:38:18.790 --> 03:38:18.800 align:start position:0%
representative ORS thank you Mr chair
 
03:38:21.790 --> 03:38:21.800 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question so
 
03:38:25.469 --> 03:38:25.479 align:start position:0%
you're going through the different taxes
 
03:38:28.269 --> 03:38:28.279 align:start position:0%
that we pay based on this and that and
 
03:38:32.349 --> 03:38:32.359 align:start position:0%
tax exemptions so my first thought is
 
03:38:36.189 --> 03:38:36.199 align:start position:0%
how do we simplify all that and what
 
03:38:39.110 --> 03:38:39.120 align:start position:0%
what might be the cost savings to the
 
03:38:41.990 --> 03:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
businesses in the state of New Hampshire
 
03:38:46.070 --> 03:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
if we were to simplify that tax code
 
03:38:50.429 --> 03:38:50.439 align:start position:0%
and the piggy back off of that a big
 
03:38:53.590 --> 03:38:53.600 align:start position:0%
issue that we're hearing of course is
 
03:38:57.309 --> 03:38:57.319 align:start position:0%
property taxes so years ago uh when I
 
03:39:00.189 --> 03:39:00.199 align:start position:0%
lived in Pennsylvania the overall State
 
03:39:02.510 --> 03:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
flat tax and they did have other taxes
 
03:39:02.520 --> 03:39:04.189 align:start position:0%
flat tax and they did have other taxes
was

03:39:04.189 --> 03:39:04.199 align:start position:0%
was
 
03:39:08.389 --> 03:39:08.399 align:start position:0%
3.2% so is there a way if you were to uh
 
03:39:11.550 --> 03:39:11.560 align:start position:0%
put your mind together with Joel and uh
 
03:39:15.510 --> 03:39:15.520 align:start position:0%
who do we have here Kevin and Robin and
 
03:39:17.630 --> 03:39:17.640 align:start position:0%
so how do you simplify the tax Cod we
 
03:39:20.590 --> 03:39:20.600 align:start position:0%
come up with one simple flat tax covers
 
03:39:22.590 --> 03:39:22.600 align:start position:0%
the property tax covers the school
 
03:39:25.830 --> 03:39:25.840 align:start position:0%
issues yada yada yada what what what's
 
03:39:28.469 --> 03:39:28.479 align:start position:0%
the answer in Your Vision to how do we
 
03:39:32.750 --> 03:39:32.760 align:start position:0%
do that very accounting like answer it
 
03:39:35.870 --> 03:39:35.880 align:start position:0%
depends lawyer
 
03:39:38.510 --> 03:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
answer and you know there's a there's a
 
03:39:39.830 --> 03:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
lot of there'd be a lot of ways to go
 
03:39:41.670 --> 03:39:41.680 align:start position:0%
about it depending on where you want
 
03:39:44.510 --> 03:39:44.520 align:start position:0%
that tax base to come from and when I
 
03:39:45.910 --> 03:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
look at
 
03:39:49.189 --> 03:39:49.199 align:start position:0%
the the business tax side um and and
 
03:39:52.189 --> 03:39:52.199 align:start position:0%
that's where most of my client base is
 
03:39:54.469 --> 03:39:54.479 align:start position:0%
I'd say when we look at the relative
 
03:39:56.229 --> 03:39:56.239 align:start position:0%
complexity of New Hampshire taxes
 
03:39:59.309 --> 03:39:59.319 align:start position:0%
compared to the size of the state it's
 
03:40:01.510 --> 03:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
completely out of balance very complex
 
03:40:04.910 --> 03:40:04.920 align:start position:0%
yeah exactly it's like we have like when
 
03:40:07.150 --> 03:40:07.160 align:start position:0%
we have groups that are you know like
 
03:40:09.830 --> 03:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
large real estate investment groups that
 
03:40:11.550 --> 03:40:11.560 align:start position:0%
and perhaps are working with a big four
 
03:40:13.309 --> 03:40:13.319 align:start position:0%
firm they're actually Consulting with
 
03:40:14.950 --> 03:40:14.960 align:start position:0%
local firms here in New Hampshire
 
03:40:16.429 --> 03:40:16.439 align:start position:0%
because they don't understand what's
 
03:40:18.389 --> 03:40:18.399 align:start position:0%
going on with the tax code and they're
 
03:40:20.030 --> 03:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
trying to understand those
 
03:40:23.309 --> 03:40:23.319 align:start position:0%
ramifications um as far as making it
 
03:40:26.349 --> 03:40:26.359 align:start position:0%
simpler it really you know really the
 
03:40:28.070 --> 03:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
the closer you end up mirroring the
 
03:40:31.269 --> 03:40:31.279 align:start position:0%
federal side the simpler it gets in my
 
03:40:32.790 --> 03:40:32.800 align:start position:0%
mind because then there's less of these
 
03:40:35.269 --> 03:40:35.279 align:start position:0%
adjustments that need to be made on an
 
03:40:38.790 --> 03:40:38.800 align:start position:0%
annual basis and and and in some ways
 
03:40:40.710 --> 03:40:40.720 align:start position:0%
you're you're not able to mirror it the
 
03:40:42.870 --> 03:40:42.880 align:start position:0%
same way with maintaining the same tax
 
03:40:44.469 --> 03:40:44.479 align:start position:0%
structure we have like you talk about
 
03:40:44.479 --> 03:40:45.910 align:start position:0%
structure we have like you talk about
Partnerships

03:40:45.910 --> 03:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
Partnerships
 
03:40:47.750 --> 03:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
well at the federal level the income of
 
03:40:49.510 --> 03:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
the partnership flows through to the
 
03:40:52.389 --> 03:40:52.399 align:start position:0%
individuals and they pay the tax well
 
03:40:54.550 --> 03:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
unless we're proposing a a personal
 
03:40:56.189 --> 03:40:56.199 align:start position:0%
income tax in New Hampshire that's not
 
03:40:58.510 --> 03:40:58.520 align:start position:0%
going to be the case so you're still
 
03:40:59.870 --> 03:40:59.880 align:start position:0%
going to be looking with how do you
 
03:41:01.150 --> 03:41:01.160 align:start position:0%
address those
 
03:41:03.590 --> 03:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
adjustments at the business level and
 
03:41:06.030 --> 03:41:06.040 align:start position:0%
across multiple businesses owned by the
 
03:41:09.150 --> 03:41:09.160 align:start position:0%
same group of owners so it's a it's it's
 
03:41:11.309 --> 03:41:11.319 align:start position:0%
a very complex it's you still end up in
 
03:41:14.469 --> 03:41:14.479 align:start position:0%
a complex result to get a simpler answer
 
03:41:15.950 --> 03:41:15.960 align:start position:0%
if that makes sense
 
03:41:17.590 --> 03:41:17.600 align:start position:0%
but yeah the closer you end up mirroring
 
03:41:19.469 --> 03:41:19.479 align:start position:0%
Federal especially a lot of these
 
03:41:21.229 --> 03:41:21.239 align:start position:0%
adjustments that are made related to
 
03:41:22.670 --> 03:41:22.680 align:start position:0%
transactions or
 
03:41:25.990 --> 03:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
depreciation um a lot of those smaller
 
03:41:27.590 --> 03:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
items if someone can just look at well
 
03:41:29.389 --> 03:41:29.399 align:start position:0%
here's my federal taxable income that's
 
03:41:30.990 --> 03:41:31.000 align:start position:0%
what I'm also dealing with with the
 
03:41:33.070 --> 03:41:33.080 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire well inherently
 
03:41:35.510 --> 03:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
that's simpler um of course it's a
 
03:41:37.429 --> 03:41:37.439 align:start position:0%
matter of policy as far as well how do
 
03:41:39.710 --> 03:41:39.720 align:start position:0%
you want to get
 
03:41:42.590 --> 03:41:42.600 align:start position:0%
there all right
 
03:41:45.269 --> 03:41:45.279 align:start position:0%
followup thank you Mr chair so you know
 
03:41:47.710 --> 03:41:47.720 align:start position:0%
God forbid we put the CPA out of
 
03:41:50.189 --> 03:41:50.199 align:start position:0%
business or the lawyers which we know is
 
03:41:53.510 --> 03:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
never going to happen but if in in your
 
03:41:57.189 --> 03:41:57.199 align:start position:0%
opinion if we could simplify the tax
 
03:42:00.790 --> 03:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
code what would you anticipate a flat
 
03:42:04.349 --> 03:42:04.359 align:start position:0%
tax being in the state of New
 
03:42:06.269 --> 03:42:06.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I definitely wouldn't be the
 
03:42:08.349 --> 03:42:08.359 align:start position:0%
one qualified to answer that question
 
03:42:10.309 --> 03:42:10.319 align:start position:0%
based on the by based on the state
 
03:42:12.110 --> 03:42:12.120 align:start position:0%
budgets admit that's not something I'm
 
03:42:14.349 --> 03:42:14.359 align:start position:0%
monitoring so I couldn't give you what
 
03:42:16.110 --> 03:42:16.120 align:start position:0%
that number might be okay very good
 
03:42:20.510 --> 03:42:20.520 align:start position:0%
thank you y representa El thank you Mr
 
03:42:23.149 --> 03:42:23.159 align:start position:0%
chair following up on representative
 
03:42:25.429 --> 03:42:25.439 align:start position:0%
Wars and and your last point of
 
03:42:28.990 --> 03:42:29.000 align:start position:0%
discussion here regarding and other
 
03:42:32.510 --> 03:42:32.520 align:start position:0%
credits yeah if you combine all the
 
03:42:34.750 --> 03:42:34.760 align:start position:0%
credits Po and then this is a
 
03:42:34.760 --> 03:42:36.149 align:start position:0%
credits Po and then this is a
speculation

03:42:36.149 --> 03:42:36.159 align:start position:0%
speculation
 
03:42:38.590 --> 03:42:38.600 align:start position:0%
question I'm looking for the general
 
03:42:40.870 --> 03:42:40.880 align:start position:0%
overall rate you said
 
03:42:44.389 --> 03:42:44.399 align:start position:0%
75% is the base rate we start from what
 
03:42:46.750 --> 03:42:46.760 align:start position:0%
would be the median or average I know
 
03:42:48.630 --> 03:42:48.640 align:start position:0%
they're two different things but
 
03:42:53.269 --> 03:42:53.279 align:start position:0%
somewhere in there rate most businesses
 
03:42:55.830 --> 03:42:55.840 align:start position:0%
who pay a tax
 
03:42:58.990 --> 03:42:59.000 align:start position:0%
pay it's really going to depend on the
 
03:43:00.710 --> 03:43:00.720 align:start position:0%
composition of the B I know terrible
 
03:43:03.830 --> 03:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
answer um like because when we look at
 
03:43:08.149 --> 03:43:08.159 align:start position:0%
call like a a a a service organization
 
03:43:09.590 --> 03:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
that they end up paying entirely the
 
03:43:11.630 --> 03:43:11.640 align:start position:0%
business Enterprise tax they have an
 
03:43:13.750 --> 03:43:13.760 align:start position:0%
entirely different world than a
 
03:43:15.630 --> 03:43:15.640 align:start position:0%
corporate manufacturer that ends up
 
03:43:17.590 --> 03:43:17.600 align:start position:0%
paying pretty close to that pure 7 and a
 
03:43:17.600 --> 03:43:20.469 align:start position:0%
paying pretty close to that pure 7 and a
half%

03:43:20.469 --> 03:43:20.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:23.710 --> 03:43:23.720 align:start position:0%
rate follow would there be any
 
03:43:26.070 --> 03:43:26.080 align:start position:0%
methodology which your Association could
 
03:43:30.550 --> 03:43:30.560 align:start position:0%
come up with that would uh generate some
 
03:43:33.870 --> 03:43:33.880 align:start position:0%
idea about the differences between uh
 
03:43:36.189 --> 03:43:36.199 align:start position:0%
say a manufacturing light industrial
 
03:43:40.469 --> 03:43:40.479 align:start position:0%
versus service and the comparative rates
 
03:43:43.269 --> 03:43:43.279 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the uh code is
 
03:43:48.229 --> 03:43:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:50.830 --> 03:43:50.840 align:start position:0%
yeah based on the data that the New
 
03:43:52.389 --> 03:43:52.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Dr collects and they have
 
03:43:53.830 --> 03:43:53.840 align:start position:0%
available to them through the Federal
 
03:43:55.469 --> 03:43:55.479 align:start position:0%
Tax Returns I'm pretty sure that they
 
03:43:57.710 --> 03:43:57.720 align:start position:0%
would be able to pull
 
03:44:00.469 --> 03:44:00.479 align:start position:0%
together something along those lines but
 
03:44:02.349 --> 03:44:02.359 align:start position:0%
and that that'd be a great question for
 
03:44:02.359 --> 03:44:03.269 align:start position:0%
and that that'd be a great question for
Lindsay

03:44:03.269 --> 03:44:03.279 align:start position:0%
Lindsay
 
03:44:05.910 --> 03:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
too right thank you another followup
 
03:44:08.830 --> 03:44:08.840 align:start position:0%
please follow up yeah you mentioned uh
 
03:44:11.269 --> 03:44:11.279 align:start position:0%
that the Safe Harbor is C it's currently
 
03:44:16.070 --> 03:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
at uh 75k correct I recall some
 
03:44:18.349 --> 03:44:18.359 align:start position:0%
discussion of increasing that to 100 I
 
03:44:21.429 --> 03:44:21.439 align:start position:0%
don't remember 110 and I don't remember
 
03:44:28.269 --> 03:44:28.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:31.110 --> 03:44:31.120 align:start position:0%
uh if that were to take
 
03:44:34.070 --> 03:44:34.080 align:start position:0%
place that sounds like reasonable but
 
03:44:35.790 --> 03:44:35.800 align:start position:0%
how would it operate with the cola would
 
03:44:36.790 --> 03:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
it be an
 
03:44:39.590 --> 03:44:39.600 align:start position:0%
automatic based upon the federal law or
 
03:44:41.910 --> 03:44:41.920 align:start position:0%
would we take an action each year to do
 
03:44:44.429 --> 03:44:44.439 align:start position:0%
it uh I know that if it's if it's a
 
03:44:46.710 --> 03:44:46.720 align:start position:0%
rolling thing then we're not meeting our
 
03:44:49.870 --> 03:44:49.880 align:start position:0%
constitutional obligation to the way it
 
03:44:51.870 --> 03:44:51.880 align:start position:0%
sets According to some people some
 
03:44:54.510 --> 03:44:54.520 align:start position:0%
people say that it does but how would
 
03:44:58.630 --> 03:44:58.640 align:start position:0%
that work if you can yeah and from what
 
03:45:01.030 --> 03:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
I recall from their proposal yeah is I I
 
03:45:04.030 --> 03:45:04.040 align:start position:0%
couldn't re I think it was a 100 I feel
 
03:45:05.590 --> 03:45:05.600 align:start position:0%
like I I heard some discussion of a
 
03:45:06.790 --> 03:45:06.800 align:start position:0%
little bit higher at some point but I
 
03:45:10.590 --> 03:45:10.600 align:start position:0%
think the proposal was actually 100 um
 
03:45:14.550 --> 03:45:14.560 align:start position:0%
but the the proposal included a every
 
03:45:17.830 --> 03:45:17.840 align:start position:0%
other year adjustment for cost of living
 
03:45:20.790 --> 03:45:20.800 align:start position:0%
increase and I I I don't recall right
 
03:45:25.670 --> 03:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
now what that was tied to directly you
 
03:45:27.429 --> 03:45:27.439 align:start position:0%
what metric they were
 
03:45:31.309 --> 03:45:31.319 align:start position:0%
utilizing thank you represent omy thank
 
03:45:36.990 --> 03:45:37.000 align:start position:0%
you and way and Ms uh produced that Safe
 
03:45:42.229 --> 03:45:42.239 align:start position:0%
Harbor bill and we defended it against
 
03:45:45.349 --> 03:45:45.359 align:start position:0%
Republican opposition and uh got it
 
03:45:48.510 --> 03:45:48.520 align:start position:0%
through and then uh we're killed in the
 
03:45:50.469 --> 03:45:50.479 align:start position:0%
election because they used it against us
 
03:45:55.149 --> 03:45:55.159 align:start position:0%
and then you adopted it but uh and and
 
03:45:58.269 --> 03:45:58.279 align:start position:0%
you put it up to 75 which is what we
 
03:46:00.990 --> 03:46:01.000 align:start position:0%
wanted except that uh Governor Lynch was
 
03:46:05.469 --> 03:46:05.479 align:start position:0%
afraid of going that high so um so it's
 
03:46:07.670 --> 03:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
been it stayed at
 
03:46:11.110 --> 03:46:11.120 align:start position:0%
75 um I don't know if it stayed long
 
03:46:14.429 --> 03:46:14.439 align:start position:0%
enough to get to 100% do you have you
 
03:46:17.349 --> 03:46:17.359 align:start position:0%
looked at that I mean to 100K yeah C
 
03:46:20.349 --> 03:46:20.359 align:start position:0%
currently it is just at $75,000 if you
 
03:46:23.269 --> 03:46:23.279 align:start position:0%
put the CPI which is what we also
 
03:46:27.550 --> 03:46:27.560 align:start position:0%
remember used for for the BET and the
 
03:46:27.560 --> 03:46:29.070 align:start position:0%
remember used for for the BET and the
BPT

03:46:29.070 --> 03:46:29.080 align:start position:0%
BPT
 
03:46:31.349 --> 03:46:31.359 align:start position:0%
um then
 
03:46:36.309 --> 03:46:36.319 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if it's CPI Urban new H
 
03:46:41.030 --> 03:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
New England yeah we've beening just off
 
03:46:43.510 --> 03:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
the cuff my estimation from 75,000 when
 
03:46:46.790 --> 03:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
that was set over a decade go to to
 
03:46:48.830 --> 03:46:48.840 align:start position:0%
today just looking at the last few years
 
03:46:50.710 --> 03:46:50.720 align:start position:0%
I think you'd certainly be well in
 
03:46:53.349 --> 03:46:53.359 align:start position:0%
excess of 100,000 you'd have to run the
 
03:46:56.910 --> 03:46:56.920 align:start position:0%
numbers for to be sure but so we'd be
 
03:46:58.950 --> 03:46:58.960 align:start position:0%
losing a fair amount of
 
03:47:02.229 --> 03:47:02.239 align:start position:0%
Revenue yeah if it was if was I I'd say
 
03:47:05.030 --> 03:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
not that high if if the compensation
 
03:47:08.469 --> 03:47:08.479 align:start position:0%
deduction was increased that Safe Harbor
 
03:47:10.349 --> 03:47:10.359 align:start position:0%
it could potentially lead
 
03:47:13.830 --> 03:47:13.840 align:start position:0%
to less Revenue in that now taxpayers
 
03:47:17.189 --> 03:47:17.199 align:start position:0%
are able to U a safe harbor to have less
 
03:47:20.630 --> 03:47:20.640 align:start position:0%
subject to business profits tax at 75%
 
03:47:23.189 --> 03:47:23.199 align:start position:0%
and move it over to the BET bucket at
 
03:47:23.199 --> 03:47:25.070 align:start position:0%
and move it over to the BET bucket at
currently

03:47:25.070 --> 03:47:25.080 align:start position:0%
currently
 
03:47:25.080 --> 03:47:26.990 align:start position:0%
currently
0.55%

03:47:26.990 --> 03:47:27.000 align:start position:0%
0.55%
 
03:47:29.630 --> 03:47:29.640 align:start position:0%
yeah thanks is is that does that end up
 
03:47:33.189 --> 03:47:33.199 align:start position:0%
being a no questions asked deduction or
 
03:47:35.269 --> 03:47:35.279 align:start position:0%
is it I know I know you don't have to
 
03:47:38.349 --> 03:47:38.359 align:start position:0%
have paperwork but is
 
03:47:41.349 --> 03:47:41.359 align:start position:0%
it can Dr look at and say well this
 
03:47:43.309 --> 03:47:43.319 align:start position:0%
business that's that's too high for this
 
03:47:45.189 --> 03:47:45.199 align:start position:0%
or is it no questions asked no they
 
03:47:48.510 --> 03:47:48.520 align:start position:0%
can't cross the board there there is a
 
03:47:51.910 --> 03:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
very uh difficult history behind making
 
03:47:55.510 --> 03:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
it no questions asked let just yeah at
 
03:47:57.750 --> 03:47:57.760 align:start position:0%
at one point in time there was a number
 
03:48:00.790 --> 03:48:00.800 align:start position:0%
of Dr audits surrounding reasonable
 
03:48:02.870 --> 03:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
compensation that has not been the case
 
03:48:05.550 --> 03:48:05.560 align:start position:0%
for some time in my experience okay
 
03:48:08.429 --> 03:48:08.439 align:start position:0%
great thank you um seeing no other
 
03:48:17.070 --> 03:48:17.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:19.429 --> 03:48:19.439 align:start position:0%
and let's see it looks like we now have
 
03:48:23.590 --> 03:48:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:27.830 --> 03:48:27.840 align:start position:0%
up good afternoon Mr chairman members
 
03:48:31.149 --> 03:48:31.159 align:start position:0%
of uh of the commission uh I will add to
 
03:48:33.990 --> 03:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
my resume that Robin gave that some time
 
03:48:36.389 --> 03:48:36.399 align:start position:0%
ago I participated in a legislative
 
03:48:40.110 --> 03:48:40.120 align:start position:0%
committee on um Water's Edge versus
 
03:48:42.469 --> 03:48:42.479 align:start position:0%
worldwide reporting a couple of folks
 
03:48:44.510 --> 03:48:44.520 align:start position:0%
are here on this committee now that we
 
03:48:48.309 --> 03:48:48.319 align:start position:0%
we serve together on that um so so far
 
03:48:50.149 --> 03:48:50.159 align:start position:0%
we've been discussing uh New Hampshire
 
03:48:52.590 --> 03:48:52.600 align:start position:0%
taxation I'm going to take it a little
 
03:48:55.510 --> 03:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
bit further in some of the other complex
 
03:48:58.510 --> 03:48:58.520 align:start position:0%
areas as it relates to when you have a
 
03:49:01.750 --> 03:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
business entity that has activity in
 
03:49:05.030 --> 03:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
more than one state and so the
 
03:49:06.790 --> 03:49:06.800 align:start position:0%
considerations that these entities have
 
03:49:10.349 --> 03:49:10.359 align:start position:0%
to take on is um where might they have a
 
03:49:13.110 --> 03:49:13.120 align:start position:0%
filing requirement in what states and if
 
03:49:14.510 --> 03:49:14.520 align:start position:0%
they do once they figure out they have
 
03:49:16.870 --> 03:49:16.880 align:start position:0%
to file in more than one state how do
 
03:49:18.910 --> 03:49:18.920 align:start position:0%
they split up the pie how do they take
 
03:49:20.830 --> 03:49:20.840 align:start position:0%
that net income and piece it to the
 
03:49:23.750 --> 03:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
various States in order to determine
 
03:49:25.309 --> 03:49:25.319 align:start position:0%
what their taxable income is and their
 
03:49:27.229 --> 03:49:27.239 align:start position:0%
taxes are in in those
 
03:49:29.990 --> 03:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
States further than that if you have
 
03:49:32.070 --> 03:49:32.080 align:start position:0%
entities that have some commonality
 
03:49:35.269 --> 03:49:35.279 align:start position:0%
common control common operations and and
 
03:49:37.469 --> 03:49:37.479 align:start position:0%
relationships is there a requirement
 
03:49:39.990 --> 03:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
that these entities have to combine
 
03:49:42.269 --> 03:49:42.279 align:start position:0%
their reporting into one reporting to
 
03:49:43.870 --> 03:49:43.880 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire or other
 
03:49:43.880 --> 03:49:45.189 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire or other
states

03:49:45.189 --> 03:49:45.199 align:start position:0%
states
 
03:49:46.550 --> 03:49:46.560 align:start position:0%
and then lastly I'm going to touch base
 
03:49:48.710 --> 03:49:48.720 align:start position:0%
on if you have a New Hampshire entity or
 
03:49:50.830 --> 03:49:50.840 align:start position:0%
taxpayer that may have an interest in a
 
03:49:53.229 --> 03:49:53.239 align:start position:0%
foreign entity and how does that
 
03:49:55.710 --> 03:49:55.720 align:start position:0%
activity get reported in New Hampshire
 
03:49:57.550 --> 03:49:57.560 align:start position:0%
so relative to the first item as to
 
03:49:58.750 --> 03:49:58.760 align:start position:0%
whether or not there's a filing
 
03:50:01.830 --> 03:50:01.840 align:start position:0%
requirement and many of you we have sat
 
03:50:04.110 --> 03:50:04.120 align:start position:0%
through this presentation before and and
 
03:50:05.950 --> 03:50:05.960 align:start position:0%
so hopefully this is just a refresher
 
03:50:07.910 --> 03:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
but one of the magic words that we use
 
03:50:11.229 --> 03:50:11.239 align:start position:0%
is Nexus and Nexus uh kind of loosely
 
03:50:14.070 --> 03:50:14.080 align:start position:0%
defined uh is the requisite contact
 
03:50:16.550 --> 03:50:16.560 align:start position:0%
between a taxpayer and a state before
 
03:50:19.550 --> 03:50:19.560 align:start position:0%
the state has jurisdiction to tax uh the
 
03:50:21.830 --> 03:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
taxpayer meaning does the taxpayer have
 
03:50:24.349 --> 03:50:24.359 align:start position:0%
some presence within a state that the
 
03:50:26.149 --> 03:50:26.159 align:start position:0%
state laws and the federal laws
 
03:50:27.830 --> 03:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
potentially mean that they're now
 
03:50:29.750 --> 03:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
subject to the taxation rules and laws
 
03:50:32.790 --> 03:50:32.800 align:start position:0%
of that particular State now when
 
03:50:35.110 --> 03:50:35.120 align:start position:0%
there's a physical presence for a
 
03:50:37.510 --> 03:50:37.520 align:start position:0%
company they have employees in a state
 
03:50:39.070 --> 03:50:39.080 align:start position:0%
they have property in a state they have
 
03:50:41.389 --> 03:50:41.399 align:start position:0%
an office that will almost automatically
 
03:50:44.830 --> 03:50:44.840 align:start position:0%
create Nexus to make them subject to the
 
03:50:47.030 --> 03:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
taxation laws and rs of that particular
 
03:50:51.149 --> 03:50:51.159 align:start position:0%
state but a lot of states have um Nexus
 
03:50:52.990 --> 03:50:53.000 align:start position:0%
definitions that go beyond just a
 
03:50:55.189 --> 03:50:55.199 align:start position:0%
physical presence we often refer to
 
03:50:57.550 --> 03:50:57.560 align:start position:0%
these as economic Nexus excuse me I'm
 
03:50:59.149 --> 03:50:59.159 align:start position:0%
want to check my clock because I tend to
 
03:51:01.189 --> 03:51:01.199 align:start position:0%
ramble i' love to hear the sound of my
 
03:51:01.199 --> 03:51:05.590 align:start position:0%
ramble i' love to hear the sound of my
own

03:51:05.590 --> 03:51:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:09.590 --> 03:51:09.600 align:start position:0%
voice um New Hampshire has a definition
 
03:51:11.630 --> 03:51:11.640 align:start position:0%
under um RSA
 
03:51:13.990 --> 03:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
77a uh and I won't read all of it but it
 
03:51:15.990 --> 03:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
refers to a business activity business
 
03:51:18.269 --> 03:51:18.279 align:start position:0%
activity means a substantial economic
 
03:51:20.309 --> 03:51:20.319 align:start position:0%
presence evidenced by a purposeful
 
03:51:22.870 --> 03:51:22.880 align:start position:0%
direction of business toward the state
 
03:51:25.790 --> 03:51:25.800 align:start position:0%
etc etc and so in New Hampshire it's not
 
03:51:27.710 --> 03:51:27.720 align:start position:0%
just physical Nexus but potentially an
 
03:51:30.990 --> 03:51:31.000 align:start position:0%
economic Nexus could create now one
 
03:51:33.309 --> 03:51:33.319 align:start position:0%
hurdle that states have to face with
 
03:51:36.510 --> 03:51:36.520 align:start position:0%
economic Nexus is public law 86 272
 
03:51:38.870 --> 03:51:38.880 align:start position:0%
which has been around a long time and
 
03:51:41.990 --> 03:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
that essentially uh limits the ability
 
03:51:45.110 --> 03:51:45.120 align:start position:0%
for a state to impose taxation
 
03:51:47.269 --> 03:51:47.279 align:start position:0%
if the only activity a company has in a
 
03:51:50.070 --> 03:51:50.080 align:start position:0%
state is the solicitation of orders but
 
03:51:51.189 --> 03:51:51.199 align:start position:0%
that has come through a lot of
 
03:51:52.950 --> 03:51:52.960 align:start position:0%
challenges over the last few years you
 
03:51:55.790 --> 03:51:55.800 align:start position:0%
may be familiar with South Dakota versus
 
03:51:59.030 --> 03:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
Wayfair in which there was an decision
 
03:52:02.429 --> 03:52:02.439 align:start position:0%
by the courts that for sales and use tax
 
03:52:04.070 --> 03:52:04.080 align:start position:0%
they don't need physical presence they
 
03:52:06.469 --> 03:52:06.479 align:start position:0%
just need economic presence and every
 
03:52:07.990 --> 03:52:08.000 align:start position:0%
state comes up with their own definition
 
03:52:11.110 --> 03:52:11.120 align:start position:0%
of economic presence and so now States
 
03:52:12.269 --> 03:52:12.279 align:start position:0%
outside of New Hampshire because we
 
03:52:14.830 --> 03:52:14.840 align:start position:0%
don't have a sales tax can require
 
03:52:16.590 --> 03:52:16.600 align:start position:0%
companies that do business out of the
 
03:52:18.590 --> 03:52:18.600 align:start position:0%
state to collect and remit sales tax to
 
03:52:20.110 --> 03:52:20.120 align:start position:0%
those States even though they physically
 
03:52:22.229 --> 03:52:22.239 align:start position:0%
don't go into the state and they only
 
03:52:24.750 --> 03:52:24.760 align:start position:0%
have maybe a connection in terms of
 
03:52:27.750 --> 03:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
using um thirdparty Freight shifters to
 
03:52:30.590 --> 03:52:30.600 align:start position:0%
move their product there um also more
 
03:52:34.830 --> 03:52:34.840 align:start position:0%
recently the um Public Law 86 272 in
 
03:52:38.030 --> 03:52:38.040 align:start position:0%
terms of this limitation um has been
 
03:52:41.469 --> 03:52:41.479 align:start position:0%
challenged in terms of that it's only
 
03:52:43.389 --> 03:52:43.399 align:start position:0%
tangible property that is subject to
 
03:52:46.309 --> 03:52:46.319 align:start position:0%
this law not services and intangible
 
03:52:48.349 --> 03:52:48.359 align:start position:0%
properties so services like that of an
 
03:52:51.030 --> 03:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
attorney or CPA that may extend into
 
03:52:54.070 --> 03:52:54.080 align:start position:0%
another state may be subject to these
 
03:52:56.630 --> 03:52:56.640 align:start position:0%
economic Nexus and so that's the first
 
03:52:58.910 --> 03:52:58.920 align:start position:0%
thing a a a company has to do is do I
 
03:53:00.309 --> 03:53:00.319 align:start position:0%
get do I have Nexus whether it's
 
03:53:02.510 --> 03:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
physical or economic that may make me
 
03:53:04.710 --> 03:53:04.720 align:start position:0%
subject to the taxation laws of another
 
03:53:07.870 --> 03:53:07.880 align:start position:0%
state so once they make that decision
 
03:53:09.630 --> 03:53:09.640 align:start position:0%
that they have a filing requirement the
 
03:53:11.790 --> 03:53:11.800 align:start position:0%
next thing is um how do we split up the
 
03:53:13.189 --> 03:53:13.199 align:start position:0%
p and that's where this next term
 
03:53:15.149 --> 03:53:15.159 align:start position:0%
apportionment which has already been
 
03:53:17.429 --> 03:53:17.439 align:start position:0%
used here comes into play and a portion
 
03:53:19.870 --> 03:53:19.880 align:start position:0%
meant roughly is essentially the formula
 
03:53:22.229 --> 03:53:22.239 align:start position:0%
that the states develop to determine how
 
03:53:25.110 --> 03:53:25.120 align:start position:0%
you allocate your net profit to the
 
03:53:27.469 --> 03:53:27.479 align:start position:0%
various states that you're taxable in
 
03:53:28.910 --> 03:53:28.920 align:start position:0%
historically there used to be three
 
03:53:30.309 --> 03:53:30.319 align:start position:0%
things that states used to look at
 
03:53:33.110 --> 03:53:33.120 align:start position:0%
including New Hampshire sales property
 
03:53:36.349 --> 03:53:36.359 align:start position:0%
and wages um a couple years ago uh New
 
03:53:38.070 --> 03:53:38.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire moved to just looking at sales
 
03:53:39.950 --> 03:53:39.960 align:start position:0%
that we refer to it as the single sales
 
03:53:41.790 --> 03:53:41.800 align:start position:0%
Factor so New Hampshire when looking at
 
03:53:44.750 --> 03:53:44.760 align:start position:0%
a portion M formula only looks at sales
 
03:53:46.429 --> 03:53:46.439 align:start position:0%
a lot of other states have moved over to
 
03:53:48.870 --> 03:53:48.880 align:start position:0%
sales as well but even though that has
 
03:53:51.710 --> 03:53:51.720 align:start position:0%
been simplified to only include sales
 
03:53:55.710 --> 03:53:55.720 align:start position:0%
there's still a lot of um ambiguity or
 
03:53:57.309 --> 03:53:57.319 align:start position:0%
complications that come with just
 
03:54:01.710 --> 03:54:01.720 align:start position:0%
looking at sales apportionment um and
 
03:54:03.550 --> 03:54:03.560 align:start position:0%
part of that is really because it's hard
 
03:54:05.950 --> 03:54:05.960 align:start position:0%
to because states have some States
 
03:54:07.590 --> 03:54:07.600 align:start position:0%
including New Hampshire recently have
 
03:54:10.670 --> 03:54:10.680 align:start position:0%
moved to market-based sourcing so
 
03:54:12.790 --> 03:54:12.800 align:start position:0%
historically we used to use and some
 
03:54:14.870 --> 03:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
states still use cost performance I'm a
 
03:54:18.030 --> 03:54:18.040 align:start position:0%
CPA I do a tax return for a client who
 
03:54:19.910 --> 03:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
uh lives in Massachusetts but all my
 
03:54:21.990 --> 03:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
employees are here so under cost of
 
03:54:25.229 --> 03:54:25.239 align:start position:0%
performance that sale was generated here
 
03:54:27.070 --> 03:54:27.080 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire because that's where we
 
03:54:28.469 --> 03:54:28.479 align:start position:0%
the cost of that performance was
 
03:54:31.790 --> 03:54:31.800 align:start position:0%
incurred under the market based approach
 
03:54:33.990 --> 03:54:34.000 align:start position:0%
because the client is in Massachusetts
 
03:54:36.189 --> 03:54:36.199 align:start position:0%
and they receive the benefit of my
 
03:54:38.590 --> 03:54:38.600 align:start position:0%
service in Massachusetts that sale is
 
03:54:41.309 --> 03:54:41.319 align:start position:0%
now a portioned to Massachusetts for
 
03:54:43.229 --> 03:54:43.239 align:start position:0%
purposes of determining how we allocate
 
03:54:45.469 --> 03:54:45.479 align:start position:0%
it for the two tax returns that I file
 
03:54:47.670 --> 03:54:47.680 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and Massachusetts so
 
03:54:50.550 --> 03:54:50.560 align:start position:0%
that's market-based sourcing and again a
 
03:54:52.429 --> 03:54:52.439 align:start position:0%
couple years ago New Hampshire moved to
 
03:54:54.870 --> 03:54:54.880 align:start position:0%
market-based sourcing it gets very
 
03:54:57.110 --> 03:54:57.120 align:start position:0%
complex uh for a number of reasons you
 
03:54:58.630 --> 03:54:58.640 align:start position:0%
know you take a software company that
 
03:55:01.269 --> 03:55:01.279 align:start position:0%
develops software in one state but they
 
03:55:03.229 --> 03:55:03.239 align:start position:0%
put it on a server in another state for
 
03:55:06.830 --> 03:55:06.840 align:start position:0%
a client that has places all over the US
 
03:55:09.309 --> 03:55:09.319 align:start position:0%
that access it or maybe download it and
 
03:55:10.830 --> 03:55:10.840 align:start position:0%
how do you determine what the state is
 
03:55:12.790 --> 03:55:12.800 align:start position:0%
and so there's a lot of complexity that
 
03:55:14.510 --> 03:55:14.520 align:start position:0%
comes with market-based
 
03:55:17.870 --> 03:55:17.880 align:start position:0%
sourcing um but so now we've moved from
 
03:55:19.830 --> 03:55:19.840 align:start position:0%
uh Nexus and now we've determined how do
 
03:55:22.269 --> 03:55:22.279 align:start position:0%
we split the pi the apportionment and
 
03:55:23.550 --> 03:55:23.560 align:start position:0%
then we come into the question is what
 
03:55:25.309 --> 03:55:25.319 align:start position:0%
if you have a lot of businesses that
 
03:55:27.670 --> 03:55:27.680 align:start position:0%
have common relationships and there are
 
03:55:29.030 --> 03:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
reasons in which they've kind of
 
03:55:31.149 --> 03:55:31.159 align:start position:0%
segregated these operations into
 
03:55:33.229 --> 03:55:33.239 align:start position:0%
separate companies well this is where we
 
03:55:36.429 --> 03:55:36.439 align:start position:0%
get into the concept of unitary filing
 
03:55:39.870 --> 03:55:39.880 align:start position:0%
um uh unitary filing the definition uh
 
03:55:43.469 --> 03:55:43.479 align:start position:0%
is located also under RSA 77a it says
 
03:55:45.070 --> 03:55:45.080 align:start position:0%
unitary business business means one or
 
03:55:47.070 --> 03:55:47.080 align:start position:0%
more related business organizations
 
03:55:49.030 --> 03:55:49.040 align:start position:0%
engage in business activity both within
 
03:55:51.469 --> 03:55:51.479 align:start position:0%
and without the state among which there
 
03:55:54.309 --> 03:55:54.319 align:start position:0%
exists Unity of ownership operation use
 
03:55:56.269 --> 03:55:56.279 align:start position:0%
and interdependence in their functions
 
03:55:58.149 --> 03:55:58.159 align:start position:0%
so if there's some ownership or
 
03:55:59.910 --> 03:55:59.920 align:start position:0%
commonality or use between these
 
03:56:01.950 --> 03:56:01.960 align:start position:0%
entities and they may be determined that
 
03:56:03.229 --> 03:56:03.239 align:start position:0%
hey you got to take these separate
 
03:56:06.870 --> 03:56:06.880 align:start position:0%
entities and you have to combine them in
 
03:56:09.469 --> 03:56:09.479 align:start position:0%
order to report so you would put these
 
03:56:11.349 --> 03:56:11.359 align:start position:0%
entities together into one profit and
 
03:56:13.630 --> 03:56:13.640 align:start position:0%
loss and balance sheet you might SE take
 
03:56:16.309 --> 03:56:16.319 align:start position:0%
out inter company um activity and then
 
03:56:18.070 --> 03:56:18.080 align:start position:0%
you'd apportion it again based on the
 
03:56:20.229 --> 03:56:20.239 align:start position:0%
apportionment rules and you come up with
 
03:56:23.309 --> 03:56:23.319 align:start position:0%
one return for one or several entities
 
03:56:26.670 --> 03:56:26.680 align:start position:0%
um uh to report in New Hampshire um
 
03:56:28.830 --> 03:56:28.840 align:start position:0%
under Revenue ruling section 301 they
 
03:56:31.309 --> 03:56:31.319 align:start position:0%
get into more detail the definition of
 
03:56:35.790 --> 03:56:35.800 align:start position:0%
unity of operation uh use Etc
 
03:56:38.870 --> 03:56:38.880 align:start position:0%
so we now have a situation where we have
 
03:56:40.750 --> 03:56:40.760 align:start position:0%
this complexity of multiple States and
 
03:56:42.790 --> 03:56:42.800 align:start position:0%
potentially consolidating entities
 
03:56:45.229 --> 03:56:45.239 align:start position:0%
together and some states states have
 
03:56:47.830 --> 03:56:47.840 align:start position:0%
unitary requirements that have different
 
03:56:49.349 --> 03:56:49.359 align:start position:0%
definitions than what New Hampshire has
 
03:56:51.149 --> 03:56:51.159 align:start position:0%
and some doesn't and so for as a
 
03:56:53.590 --> 03:56:53.600 align:start position:0%
practitioner I may find that I have to
 
03:56:56.269 --> 03:56:56.279 align:start position:0%
fill a unitary return for New Hampshire
 
03:56:59.110 --> 03:56:59.120 align:start position:0%
but file several returns for my clients
 
03:57:00.710 --> 03:57:00.720 align:start position:0%
um in different states that are
 
03:57:05.550 --> 03:57:05.560 align:start position:0%
individually done um so that is the
 
03:57:08.630 --> 03:57:08.640 align:start position:0%
concept of uh unitary filing uh and the
 
03:57:11.630 --> 03:57:11.640 align:start position:0%
last item is relative to um when we have
 
03:57:13.670 --> 03:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
foreign activity and as I had mentioned
 
03:57:15.269 --> 03:57:15.279 align:start position:0%
I was on that commission about worldwide
 
03:57:17.510 --> 03:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
reporting and Water's Edge so when we
 
03:57:19.309 --> 03:57:19.319 align:start position:0%
talk about uh
 
03:57:21.389 --> 03:57:21.399 align:start position:0%
apportionment New Hampshire uses what's
 
03:57:23.349 --> 03:57:23.359 align:start position:0%
known as a waters's edge and essentially
 
03:57:25.269 --> 03:57:25.279 align:start position:0%
The Waters Edge means go up to the coast
 
03:57:27.110 --> 03:57:27.120 align:start position:0%
and you're done you don't include any
 
03:57:30.469 --> 03:57:30.479 align:start position:0%
other entities in your unitary filing
 
03:57:33.030 --> 03:57:33.040 align:start position:0%
that are outside of the United States
 
03:57:35.469 --> 03:57:35.479 align:start position:0%
historically New Hampshire would only
 
03:57:37.269 --> 03:57:37.279 align:start position:0%
tax the income on foreign entities when
 
03:57:39.070 --> 03:57:39.080 align:start position:0%
the money came into the state so you
 
03:57:40.870 --> 03:57:40.880 align:start position:0%
have an entity in New Hampshire they own
 
03:57:43.149 --> 03:57:43.159 align:start position:0%
a company in Germany Germany issues a
 
03:57:45.070 --> 03:57:45.080 align:start position:0%
distribution it comes back to the US and
 
03:57:46.790 --> 03:57:46.800 align:start position:0%
then New Hampshire would tax it at that
 
03:57:48.950 --> 03:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
particular point a couple of budget
 
03:57:52.349 --> 03:57:52.359 align:start position:0%
sessions ago I'm sorry in uh the tax cut
 
03:57:54.750 --> 03:57:54.760 align:start position:0%
and jobs act which was a major overhaul
 
03:57:57.670 --> 03:57:57.680 align:start position:0%
of the federal system back in 2017 came
 
03:57:59.990 --> 03:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
up with a new tax for foreign companies
 
03:58:01.710 --> 03:58:01.720 align:start position:0%
it's called the guilty tax Global
 
03:58:03.830 --> 03:58:03.840 align:start position:0%
intangible low tax income and
 
03:58:05.990 --> 03:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
essentially this uh federal government
 
03:58:07.990 --> 03:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
is now looking at foreign entities that
 
03:58:10.389 --> 03:58:10.399 align:start position:0%
are controll foreign corporations and
 
03:58:13.830 --> 03:58:13.840 align:start position:0%
including that income onto the federal
 
03:58:16.990 --> 03:58:17.000 align:start position:0%
return is a credit for foreign taxes but
 
03:58:18.950 --> 03:58:18.960 align:start position:0%
um and a couple of budget sessions ago
 
03:58:21.469 --> 03:58:21.479 align:start position:0%
it was decided that 50% of This Global
 
03:58:23.790 --> 03:58:23.800 align:start position:0%
intangible low tax income would find its
 
03:58:26.510 --> 03:58:26.520 align:start position:0%
way onto the business profits tax return
 
03:58:29.830 --> 03:58:29.840 align:start position:0%
and so there is some inclusion of global
 
03:58:32.030 --> 03:58:32.040 align:start position:0%
intangible low tax income on the New
 
03:58:34.830 --> 03:58:34.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire business profits tax return so
 
03:58:37.349 --> 03:58:37.359 align:start position:0%
even though we are still at Water's Edge
 
03:58:39.269 --> 03:58:39.279 align:start position:0%
meaning we're not incorporating all of
 
03:58:40.870 --> 03:58:40.880 align:start position:0%
those foreign entities onto the New
 
03:58:43.790 --> 03:58:43.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire return um there is recognition
 
03:58:45.910 --> 03:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
of foreign income to a degree on the New
 
03:58:48.910 --> 03:58:48.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire return so
 
03:58:51.750 --> 03:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
um I think that's about my 10 minutes
 
03:58:53.389 --> 03:58:53.399 align:start position:0%
and I know that's a lot and if your head
 
03:58:54.870 --> 03:58:54.880 align:start position:0%
didn't hurt a little bit after I'm done
 
03:58:57.670 --> 03:58:57.680 align:start position:0%
then I didn't do my job right so thank
 
03:59:00.070 --> 03:59:00.080 align:start position:0%
you representative shamberg thank you Mr
 
03:59:01.429 --> 03:59:01.439 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
03:59:04.389 --> 03:59:04.399 align:start position:0%
question uh is there a
 
03:59:07.630 --> 03:59:07.640 align:start position:0%
possibility of reduction of uh net
 
03:59:09.550 --> 03:59:09.560 align:start position:0%
profits to be taxed by the state of New
 
03:59:12.030 --> 03:59:12.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if you use only single sales
 
03:59:14.990 --> 03:59:15.000 align:start position:0%
or if you only use market-based sour ing
 
03:59:17.030 --> 03:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
I don't have the data to understand I
 
03:59:19.309 --> 03:59:19.319 align:start position:0%
think the Dr would would would have a
 
03:59:20.870 --> 03:59:20.880 align:start position:0%
better sense of that yeah I just thought
 
03:59:23.469 --> 03:59:23.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:26.710 --> 03:59:26.720 align:start position:0%
would represent boards thank you Mr
 
03:59:28.309 --> 03:59:28.319 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
03:59:30.870 --> 03:59:30.880 align:start position:0%
question so back in the covid when
 
03:59:33.269 --> 03:59:33.279 align:start position:0%
people were working in New Hampshire but
 
03:59:35.830 --> 03:59:35.840 align:start position:0%
still had to pay a mass tax they weren't
 
03:59:38.990 --> 03:59:39.000 align:start position:0%
Computing the max a mass uh how does
 
03:59:42.790 --> 03:59:42.800 align:start position:0%
that play into your economic your Nexus
 
03:59:45.309 --> 03:59:45.319 align:start position:0%
and your uh you know can you give us how
 
03:59:47.349 --> 03:59:47.359 align:start position:0%
that played out sure so relative to what
 
03:59:49.030 --> 03:59:49.040 align:start position:0%
I was referring to which has to do with
 
03:59:52.830 --> 03:59:52.840 align:start position:0%
the the business activity um it it
 
03:59:55.149 --> 03:59:55.159 align:start position:0%
didn't play into it quite as much and
 
03:59:57.030 --> 03:59:57.040 align:start position:0%
and I and I can expand on that if need
 
03:59:58.670 --> 03:59:58.680 align:start position:0%
be but I think what you're referring to
 
04:00:02.630 --> 04:00:02.640 align:start position:0%
is individuals who were employees of
 
04:00:04.269 --> 04:00:04.279 align:start position:0%
companies in Massachusetts and they
 
04:00:06.349 --> 04:00:06.359 align:start position:0%
weren't in Massachusetts working but
 
04:00:08.870 --> 04:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts was still taxing it yeah
 
04:00:10.830 --> 04:00:10.840 align:start position:0%
so and by the way I think that mass
 
04:00:12.630 --> 04:00:12.640 align:start position:0%
pulled that off but that's a significant
 
04:00:15.030 --> 04:00:15.040 align:start position:0%
issue in terms of other states too New
 
04:00:17.189 --> 04:00:17.199 align:start position:0%
York is very aggressive that if you work
 
04:00:18.710 --> 04:00:18.720 align:start position:0%
for a New York company even though you
 
04:00:21.149 --> 04:00:21.159 align:start position:0%
never step state in Step into the state
 
04:00:23.590 --> 04:00:23.600 align:start position:0%
they're still taxing you as a New York
 
04:00:27.269 --> 04:00:27.279 align:start position:0%
employee um and so essentially the um uh
 
04:00:29.070 --> 04:00:29.080 align:start position:0%
the states basically especially when Co
 
04:00:31.349 --> 04:00:31.359 align:start position:0%
hits pass these laws that said look we
 
04:00:32.950 --> 04:00:32.960 align:start position:0%
know that the the rules used to be if
 
04:00:34.429 --> 04:00:34.439 align:start position:0%
you weren't in the state it wasn't
 
04:00:37.229 --> 04:00:37.239 align:start position:0%
considered Mass wages um but of course
 
04:00:39.030 --> 04:00:39.040 align:start position:0%
when Co hit they said no we we can't
 
04:00:40.550 --> 04:00:40.560 align:start position:0%
just suddenly lose all this Revenue
 
04:00:43.429 --> 04:00:43.439 align:start position:0%
because everybody's working at home um
 
04:00:46.030 --> 04:00:46.040 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I've seen too much there's
 
04:00:48.429 --> 04:00:48.439 align:start position:0%
been a lot of discussion and debate and
 
04:00:50.189 --> 04:00:50.199 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what court cases have come
 
04:00:52.349 --> 04:00:52.359 align:start position:0%
up on this but it seems to me that the
 
04:00:55.429 --> 04:00:55.439 align:start position:0%
states have largely won on their um
 
04:00:57.910 --> 04:00:57.920 align:start position:0%
arguments that if you're working for a
 
04:01:00.670 --> 04:01:00.680 align:start position:0%
company in their state and there's some
 
04:01:02.710 --> 04:01:02.720 align:start position:0%
sort of connection enough within that
 
04:01:07.070 --> 04:01:07.080 align:start position:0%
state that you're in it or that you um
 
04:01:10.830 --> 04:01:10.840 align:start position:0%
um uh um don't have an exemption that
 
04:01:13.910 --> 04:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
those taxes are subject to income taxes
 
04:01:16.550 --> 04:01:16.560 align:start position:0%
personally for those States so probably
 
04:01:18.870 --> 04:01:18.880 align:start position:0%
not a great answer to your question but
 
04:01:22.149 --> 04:01:22.159 align:start position:0%
no pretty much so was New Hampshire
 
04:01:25.550 --> 04:01:25.560 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you so was New Hampshire
 
04:01:29.630 --> 04:01:29.640 align:start position:0%
able to uh maybe buffer that a little
 
04:01:29.640 --> 04:01:30.590 align:start position:0%
able to uh maybe buffer that a little
bit

04:01:30.590 --> 04:01:30.600 align:start position:0%
bit
 
04:01:34.510 --> 04:01:34.520 align:start position:0%
or um I I don't think so I I know there
 
04:01:36.349 --> 04:01:36.359 align:start position:0%
there were some efforts I think by the
 
04:01:37.950 --> 04:01:37.960 align:start position:0%
state a couple years ago when that
 
04:01:39.990 --> 04:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
happened to kind of repudiate that and I
 
04:01:41.110 --> 04:01:41.120 align:start position:0%
don't think it ever got it my
 
04:01:44.910 --> 04:01:44.920 align:start position:0%
recollection is it didn't get anywhere
 
04:01:49.510 --> 04:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
represent elme yes could I ask on in a
 
04:01:53.469 --> 04:01:53.479 align:start position:0%
case like that if someone is living in
 
04:01:57.389 --> 04:01:57.399 align:start position:0%
Connecticut and working in in New York
 
04:02:01.830 --> 04:02:01.840 align:start position:0%
City remotely only uh would he end up
 
04:02:05.149 --> 04:02:05.159 align:start position:0%
paying income tax in both
 
04:02:08.389 --> 04:02:08.399 align:start position:0%
States potentially the same so on on the
 
04:02:10.189 --> 04:02:10.199 align:start position:0%
Assumption he would be subject to New
 
04:02:12.070 --> 04:02:12.080 align:start position:0%
York taxes now New York does have
 
04:02:15.429 --> 04:02:15.439 align:start position:0%
exemptions for things like if you are if
 
04:02:18.070 --> 04:02:18.080 align:start position:0%
your employer requires it and um if
 
04:02:19.670 --> 04:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
you're kind of the office for that
 
04:02:22.269 --> 04:02:22.279 align:start position:0%
employer in in in that state um if
 
04:02:24.389 --> 04:02:24.399 align:start position:0%
you're subject to it then every state is
 
04:02:27.070 --> 04:02:27.080 align:start position:0%
a little different relative to how they
 
04:02:29.469 --> 04:02:29.479 align:start position:0%
don't double tax you so for instance in
 
04:02:31.670 --> 04:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
Connecticut I think us the example I
 
04:02:33.910 --> 04:02:33.920 align:start position:0%
think they would give you a tax credit
 
04:02:35.870 --> 04:02:35.880 align:start position:0%
for the taxes that you paid in New York
 
04:02:37.550 --> 04:02:37.560 align:start position:0%
so you'd figure out your Connecticut
 
04:02:40.149 --> 04:02:40.159 align:start position:0%
taxes and say this is the total amount
 
04:02:41.790 --> 04:02:41.800 align:start position:0%
if um if I had to pay it all to
 
04:02:43.990 --> 04:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
Connecticut but we'll give you a little
 
04:02:45.750 --> 04:02:45.760 align:start position:0%
some some amount of credit for the taxes
 
04:02:47.710 --> 04:02:47.720 align:start position:0%
you paid in New York so if the New York
 
04:02:49.950 --> 04:02:49.960 align:start position:0%
rate is higher maybe you'd get a full
 
04:02:52.030 --> 04:02:52.040 align:start position:0%
credit or some percentage every state is
 
04:02:52.950 --> 04:02:52.960 align:start position:0%
different so I don't know what
 
04:02:54.510 --> 04:02:54.520 align:start position:0%
Connecticut would do in this particular
 
04:02:57.950 --> 04:02:57.960 align:start position:0%
case but a lot of states do provide a a
 
04:02:59.990 --> 04:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
credit to taxes you pay to other state
 
04:03:01.670 --> 04:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
on that income that you're reporting in
 
04:03:01.680 --> 04:03:03.189 align:start position:0%
on that income that you're reporting in
that

04:03:03.189 --> 04:03:03.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:03:06.469 --> 04:03:06.479 align:start position:0%
state representative
 
04:03:08.590 --> 04:03:08.600 align:start position:0%
opal thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
04:03:10.710 --> 04:03:10.720 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I I'm I I want to
 
04:03:14.550 --> 04:03:14.560 align:start position:0%
go back to uh market-based sourcing and
 
04:03:17.590 --> 04:03:17.600 align:start position:0%
I'm going to simplify this please do
 
04:03:20.070 --> 04:03:20.080 align:start position:0%
well I'm going to try let see if see if
 
04:03:22.710 --> 04:03:22.720 align:start position:0%
my simplification works if I understood
 
04:03:25.030 --> 04:03:25.040 align:start position:0%
your explanation it sounds like it is
 
04:03:26.590 --> 04:03:26.600 align:start position:0%
the difference
 
04:03:30.710 --> 04:03:30.720 align:start position:0%
between uh taxing where the work
 
04:03:33.790 --> 04:03:33.800 align:start position:0%
occurred as opposed to taxing where the
 
04:03:37.030 --> 04:03:37.040 align:start position:0%
result of that work is enjoyed yeah yeah
 
04:03:38.389 --> 04:03:38.399 align:start position:0%
every state again defines a little
 
04:03:39.790 --> 04:03:39.800 align:start position:0%
differently but it's largely who
 
04:03:42.269 --> 04:03:42.279 align:start position:0%
received the benefit of that and
 
04:03:43.910 --> 04:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
sometimes determining who receives the
 
04:03:47.670 --> 04:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
benefit could be is a complex issue okay
 
04:03:49.590 --> 04:03:49.600 align:start position:0%
follow up Mr chair
 
04:03:52.269 --> 04:03:52.279 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm trying to understand you you
 
04:03:54.950 --> 04:03:54.960 align:start position:0%
said uh New Hampshire adopted the
 
04:03:56.870 --> 04:03:56.880 align:start position:0%
market-based sourcing
 
04:04:00.269 --> 04:04:00.279 align:start position:0%
yes it it sounds to me
 
04:04:02.990 --> 04:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
like that would be
 
04:04:06.550 --> 04:04:06.560 align:start position:0%
detrimental to revenue
 
04:04:09.510 --> 04:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
potentially um in the example you cited
 
04:04:12.149 --> 04:04:12.159 align:start position:0%
you know in your own your own firm if
 
04:04:14.750 --> 04:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
you're doing the work under the old
 
04:04:16.510 --> 04:04:16.520 align:start position:0%
system the Hampshire would have taxed
 
04:04:19.510 --> 04:04:19.520 align:start position:0%
you for for whatever profit you made on
 
04:04:22.110 --> 04:04:22.120 align:start position:0%
that in the in Market based
 
04:04:25.910 --> 04:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
sourcing um Massachusetts presumably
 
04:04:28.630 --> 04:04:28.640 align:start position:0%
would would tax it and and New Hampshire
 
04:04:29.550 --> 04:04:29.560 align:start position:0%
wouldn't get the
 
04:04:31.870 --> 04:04:31.880 align:start position:0%
benefit if that's
 
04:04:34.830 --> 04:04:34.840 align:start position:0%
correct what was the justification
 
04:04:37.189 --> 04:04:37.199 align:start position:0%
because the same CPA in Massachusetts
 
04:04:39.590 --> 04:04:39.600 align:start position:0%
doing for doing uh work for somebody in
 
04:04:42.149 --> 04:04:42.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire now has to pay portion
 
04:04:44.830 --> 04:04:44.840 align:start position:0%
that income to New Hampshire and so the
 
04:04:47.510 --> 04:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
it was largely done to capture I I
 
04:04:49.229 --> 04:04:49.239 align:start position:0%
shouldn't I'm spe speculating a little
 
04:04:50.830 --> 04:04:50.840 align:start position:0%
but my opinion is that it was largely
 
04:04:53.910 --> 04:04:53.920 align:start position:0%
done to capture revenue for outof State
 
04:04:56.269 --> 04:04:56.279 align:start position:0%
companies that had customers here in New
 
04:04:59.149 --> 04:04:59.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but weren't really because the
 
04:05:00.389 --> 04:05:00.399 align:start position:0%
work was being done out of the state
 
04:05:02.469 --> 04:05:02.479 align:start position:0%
that weren't really paying a a level of
 
04:05:04.870 --> 04:05:04.880 align:start position:0%
Taxation in New Hampshire and I know I
 
04:05:07.950 --> 04:05:07.960 align:start position:0%
have um contact I've had discussions
 
04:05:09.710 --> 04:05:09.720 align:start position:0%
with the Dr and commissioner step and
 
04:05:11.309 --> 04:05:11.319 align:start position:0%
I've asked them have they been able to
 
04:05:13.870 --> 04:05:13.880 align:start position:0%
evaluate that and I think the answer was
 
04:05:15.429 --> 04:05:15.439 align:start position:0%
no they didn't have enough data yet to
 
04:05:17.750 --> 04:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
determine both single sales and Market
 
04:05:19.630 --> 04:05:19.640 align:start position:0%
based sourcing what the ramifications
 
04:05:22.030 --> 04:05:22.040 align:start position:0%
are in the revenue but I don't
 
04:05:24.149 --> 04:05:24.159 align:start position:0%
anticipate that there has been a huge
 
04:05:26.189 --> 04:05:26.199 align:start position:0%
swing one way or the other by moving to
 
04:05:30.149 --> 04:05:30.159 align:start position:0%
those one one last how how long ago was
 
04:05:32.389 --> 04:05:32.399 align:start position:0%
that change made and I'm hoping Dr is
 
04:05:34.269 --> 04:05:34.279 align:start position:0%
actually trying to capture both were
 
04:05:37.469 --> 04:05:37.479 align:start position:0%
fairly recent um single sales uh was for
 
04:05:40.269 --> 04:05:40.279 align:start position:0%
periods after December 31st 22 so only a
 
04:05:44.030 --> 04:05:44.040 align:start position:0%
couple of years ago and uh market-based
 
04:05:48.229 --> 04:05:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:51.229 --> 04:05:51.239 align:start position:0%
before and I have um tax appearance
 
04:05:53.630 --> 04:05:53.640 align:start position:0%
after for December 31st 21 uh was we
 
04:05:56.229 --> 04:05:56.239 align:start position:0%
moved to Market based sourcing thank

some outside agencies on the 14th what
 
04:06:41.950 --> 04:06:41.960 align:start position:0%
we really want to start understanding is

what's the direction of revenues heading
 
04:06:49.630 --> 04:06:49.640 align:start position:0%
because as I said earlier we'll be taxed
 
04:06:52.429 --> 04:06:52.439 align:start position:0%
with coming up with the uh Revenue
 
04:06:54.550 --> 04:06:54.560 align:start position:0%
estimates that pretty much determine
 
04:06:58.870 --> 04:06:58.880 align:start position:0%
what the state can can uh pay or or use
 
04:07:00.870 --> 04:07:00.880 align:start position:0%
Finance can use over the next two years
