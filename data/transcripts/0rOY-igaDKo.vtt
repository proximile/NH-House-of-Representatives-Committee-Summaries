e

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 align:start position:0%
good morning and welcome to the special
 
00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 align:start position:0%
committee on uh the division for
 
00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 align:start position:0%
Children and Youth Youth and families um
 
00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 align:start position:0%
I'm the chairman representative Lon and
 
00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 align:start position:0%
we have a good number of our members
 
00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 align:start position:0%
here today although some were unable to
 
00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 align:start position:0%
make it um to start off we will be
 
00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 align:start position:0%
having a work session where it's just
 
00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 align:start position:0%
the committee and normally this is for
 
00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 align:start position:0%
an hour um should we and generally when
 
00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 align:start position:0%
we hear from the public is later on at
 
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 align:start position:0%
the regular meeting which is noticed at
 
00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:23.599 align:start position:0%
11 o'clock this is for the committee and
 
00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
then we have the time to hear from the
 
00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 align:start position:0%
public afterwards um as as this moves
 
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 align:start position:0%
forward we'll figure out um we we'll
 
00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 align:start position:0%
we'll figure out all of our processes
 
00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 align:start position:0%
more but a lot of it too we want to make
 
00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 align:start position:0%
sure that people are taking the
 
00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 align:start position:0%
appropriate amount of time when they do
 
00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 align:start position:0%
speak later on and make sure that when
 
00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 align:start position:0%
people are speaking they're speaking to
 
00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 align:start position:0%
policies not people we don't want to
 
00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 align:start position:0%
hear any names because we're talking
 
00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 align:start position:0%
about the overall issues and we're not
 
00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:49.879 align:start position:0%
talking about any particular individuals
 
00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 align:start position:0%
um that's to be dealt with in in other
 
00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 align:start position:0%
ways um so with this we're going to be
 
00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 align:start position:0%
digging into due process um this is one
 
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 align:start position:0%
of those areas where everybody has a
 
00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 align:start position:0%
there there's many different
 
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 align:start position:0%
interpretations and we actually have
 
00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:05.159 align:start position:0%
some from the Constitution Center to be
 
00:03:07.149 --> 00:03:07.159 align:start position:0%
able to take a look at and see some of
 
00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:08.599 align:start position:0%
the different ways that due process has
 
00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
been viewed this is a description of due
 
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
process from the ACLU of Pennsylvania um
 
00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 align:start position:0%
I Look to bring some of those uh centerr
 
00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 align:start position:0%
groups in order to look and see what is
 
00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 align:start position:0%
going on as far as the information I
 
00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 align:start position:0%
have in front of me I'm not sure that
 
00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:24.599 align:start position:0%
we'll actually look at all of this today
 
00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 align:start position:0%
but there was actually a pretty pretty
 
00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 align:start position:0%
thorough work by prop publica looking
 
00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
about um due process and looking to some
 
00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 align:start position:0%
issues that have happened around the
 
00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 align:start position:0%
country regarding um children and
 
00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 align:start position:0%
families so there's some very
 
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 align:start position:0%
interesting discussions and it might
 
00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 align:start position:0%
actually be a little easier to look at
 
00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 align:start position:0%
some of these issues and see how other
 
00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 align:start position:0%
states have succeeded or perhaps not
 
00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 align:start position:0%
done as well as they could have because
 
00:03:51.149 --> 00:03:51.159 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of these common threads
 
00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 align:start position:0%
and common issues from state to state
 
00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 align:start position:0%
and just by removing the people from the
 
00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799 align:start position:0%
policies it might be a little bit easier
 
00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 align:start position:0%
to talk about how this state or that
 
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 align:start position:0%
state did things well or not so well as
 
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
opposed to uh getting as close to home
 
00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:05.799 align:start position:0%
early on as we're looking through all of
 
00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 align:start position:0%
these different particular issues um so
 
00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 align:start position:0%
what I just handed out from the ACLU
 
00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania says the due process is
 
00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
what separates a free Society from a
 
00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 align:start position:0%
police state when the 14th Amendment of
 
00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 align:start position:0%
the Constitution says the government
 
00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
shall not deprive any person of life
 
00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 align:start position:0%
liberty or property without due process
 
00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 align:start position:0%
of law that does not mean that the
 
00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 align:start position:0%
government cannot take away a person's
 
00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
life liberty or property but that it
 
00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:30.639 align:start position:0%
cannot take those things away without
 
00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 align:start position:0%
first giving that person a fair chance
 
00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 align:start position:0%
to defend him or herself for instance
 
00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
the government cannot imprison someone
 
00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 align:start position:0%
or take away his or her children without
 
00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:39.479 align:start position:0%
allowing the person to challenge the
 
00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
government's action um to me that seems
 
00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 align:start position:0%
like a pretty good intro introduction to
 
00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 align:start position:0%
it is there anybody who takes issue with
 
00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:47.919 align:start position:0%
any of that
 
00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 align:start position:0%
characterization okay wonderful so we
 
00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720 align:start position:0%
have some ground rules I like I I like
 
00:04:57.189 --> 00:04:57.199 align:start position:0%
agreement I absolutely like agreement um
 
00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 align:start position:0%
so now this is from the national
 
00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:01.039 align:start position:0%
Constitution Center this is a common
 
00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:06.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:08.639 align:start position:0%
process and obviously we're not going to
 
00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 align:start position:0%
be able to read through all of these
 
00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:12.759 align:start position:0%
materials but I wanted to highlight some
 
00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 align:start position:0%
of the issues that are here so within
 
00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 align:start position:0%
this at the national Constitution Center
 
00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:19.639 align:start position:0%
they did quite a bit looking at the 14th
 
00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 align:start position:0%
amendment in the due process clause um
 
00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:24.880 align:start position:0%
because the due process clause of the
 
00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:27.039 align:start position:0%
14th Amendment Echoes that of the Fifth
 
00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:29.960 align:start position:0%
Amendment um and this is with the
 
00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 align:start position:0%
interpretation um that the Fifth
 
00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:33.960 align:start position:0%
Amendment is only against the federal
 
00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:36.600 align:start position:0%
government um I'm not a constitutional
 
00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:40.039 align:start position:0%
scholar um but as we look to this um
 
00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:42.280 align:start position:0%
this has a lot of ways where the 14th
 
00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:44.639 align:start position:0%
Amendment ensures that those same
 
00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:47.479 align:start position:0%
protections of rights are done by the
 
00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:49.560 align:start position:0%
states as well as by the federal
 
00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:53.800 align:start position:0%
government um so the 14th Amendment
 
00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:55.400 align:start position:0%
prohibits States from depriving any
 
00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
person of life liberty or property
 
00:05:59.870 --> 00:05:59.880 align:start position:0%
without due process of law
 
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
and at the time so I'm going to just
 
00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:04.120 align:start position:0%
read a little bit from this because some
 
00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
of it does dovetail with some of what
 
00:06:07.309 --> 00:06:07.319 align:start position:0%
we've been discussing when it was
 
00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:08.960 align:start position:0%
adopted the Clause was understood to
 
00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.560 align:start position:0%
mean that the government could deprive a
 
00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:12.120 align:start position:0%
person's rights only according to the
 
00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:14.639 align:start position:0%
law applied by a court yet since then
 
00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:16.160 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court is elaborated
 
00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:18.560 align:start position:0%
significantly on this core understanding
 
00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:21.240 align:start position:0%
as the examples above suggest um which I
 
00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:23.440 align:start position:0%
didn't read these rights protected under
 
00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:25.560 align:start position:0%
the 14th amendment can be understood in
 
00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:27.800 align:start position:0%
three categories the first is procedural
 
00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:29.840 align:start position:0%
due process the second is is the
 
00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:31.479 align:start position:0%
individual rights listed in the Bill of
 
00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:33.240 align:start position:0%
Rights Incorporated against the states
 
00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:37.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:39.479 align:start position:0%
process so um getting into the
 
00:06:41.749 --> 00:06:41.759 align:start position:0%
procedural due process that's the
 
00:06:43.309 --> 00:06:43.319 align:start position:0%
procedures that the government needs to
 
00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:46.120 align:start position:0%
do and this this um is saying that
 
00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:48.840 align:start position:0%
historically that entailed a jury trial
 
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
um however there has been some um over
 
00:06:53.589 --> 00:06:53.599 align:start position:0%
the past two centuries states have
 
00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:55.360 align:start position:0%
developed a variety of Institutions and
 
00:06:58.469 --> 00:06:58.479 align:start position:0%
procedures for adjudicating disputes so
 
00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:00.840 align:start position:0%
the minimum of that is notice an
 
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be heard and an impartial
 
00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:05.440 align:start position:0%
tribunal um so I think that those are
 
00:07:06.749 --> 00:07:06.759 align:start position:0%
three things that we need to make sure
 
00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:09.360 align:start position:0%
that we key in on the notice the
 
00:07:11.909 --> 00:07:11.919 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be heard and an impartial
 
00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:14.360 align:start position:0%
tribunal um so as we're looking at
 
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:15.960 align:start position:0%
everything procedurally we want to make
 
00:07:17.589 --> 00:07:17.599 align:start position:0%
sure that there is that not notice
 
00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:20.080 align:start position:0%
there's that opportunity and the
 
00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:22.160 align:start position:0%
impartiality so that's something that
 
00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:24.440 align:start position:0%
may be a theme that comes back um from
 
00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
time so when we're looking at the
 
00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:31.720 align:start position:0%
expansion of those property rights um
 
00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:33.160 align:start position:0%
that's that's not one that we really
 
00:07:35.909 --> 00:07:35.919 align:start position:0%
need to look at here because um a lot of
 
00:07:38.469 --> 00:07:38.479 align:start position:0%
these do say there seems to be some good
 
00:07:40.869 --> 00:07:40.879 align:start position:0%
consensus among on I what I reviewed
 
00:07:42.749 --> 00:07:42.759 align:start position:0%
that your family and making sure that
 
00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:44.440 align:start position:0%
you're protecting your family is one of
 
00:07:46.589 --> 00:07:46.599 align:start position:0%
those interests obviously there's that
 
00:07:48.589 --> 00:07:48.599 align:start position:0%
interest as well of the child that are
 
00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:57.990 --> 00:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
balanced see so does anybody have any
 
00:07:59.070 --> 00:07:59.080 align:start position:0%
thoughts that they want to share at this
 
00:08:01.149 --> 00:08:01.159 align:start position:0%
point representative
 
00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
Weber um thank you thank you for the the
 
00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
overview and the materials um and I will
 
00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:11.000 align:start position:0%
just say that the analysis and I'm
 
00:08:13.149 --> 00:08:13.159 align:start position:0%
certainly not a constitutional scholar
 
00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:16.280 align:start position:0%
and I um but the analysis as was
 
00:08:18.149 --> 00:08:18.159 align:start position:0%
presented to us at law school is very
 
00:08:20.749 --> 00:08:20.759 align:start position:0%
similar you look first is is there a
 
00:08:23.469 --> 00:08:23.479 align:start position:0%
protected interest and I cannot think
 
00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:25.800 align:start position:0%
that anybody would not agree that the
 
00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:29.800 align:start position:0%
right to raise your family is a prote
 
00:08:31.189 --> 00:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
interest and that's exactly what you
 
00:08:32.949 --> 00:08:32.959 align:start position:0%
were talking about about the inclusion
 
00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:36.120 align:start position:0%
of Rights um and and
 
00:08:38.269 --> 00:08:38.279 align:start position:0%
secondly if there is a protected
 
00:08:40.029 --> 00:08:40.039 align:start position:0%
interest then the question is what
 
00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:43.640 align:start position:0%
processes do and that goes exactly to
 
00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:45.560 align:start position:0%
the notice the opportunity to be heard
 
00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:51.320 align:start position:0%
in an impartial tribunal um and in in if
 
00:08:53.829 --> 00:08:53.839 align:start position:0%
you are looking strictly speaking at
 
00:08:53.839 --> 00:08:55.590 align:start position:0%
you are looking strictly speaking at
DCF

00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
DCF
 
00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
procedures the
 
00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:00.600 align:start position:0%
procedures already in incorporate all of
 
00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:02.150 align:start position:0%
procedures already in incorporate all of
those

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:02.160 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:05.320 align:start position:0%
things how they play out in individual
 
00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:09.680 align:start position:0%
cases may may be an issue um but uh and
 
00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:12.760 align:start position:0%
I can think of all kinds of
 
00:09:16.829 --> 00:09:16.839 align:start position:0%
um examples for examples when when the
 
00:09:19.949 --> 00:09:19.959 align:start position:0%
courts all closed down because of covid
 
00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:22.880 align:start position:0%
uh there was less opportunity either to
 
00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:26.240 align:start position:0%
be hurt or for an impartial um that's
 
00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:29.800 align:start position:0%
that's an extreme example so those those
 
00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
may be things that are looked at as as
 
00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:36.760 align:start position:0%
we go through but um how each of these
 
00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:39.200 align:start position:0%
individual requirements plays out is is
 
00:09:41.509 --> 00:09:41.519 align:start position:0%
an important inquiry so thank you uh
 
00:09:43.069 --> 00:09:43.079 align:start position:0%
thank you for that I I would agree that
 
00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
how they play out and not just on paper
 
00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:48.320 align:start position:0%
but in practice is absolutely critical
 
00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:50.720 align:start position:0%
um I I believe I referenced that
 
00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:52.720 align:start position:0%
propublica has done a large
 
00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:54.440 align:start position:0%
investigation into this and there's
 
00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
actually been some legislative work in
 
00:09:58.430 --> 00:09:58.440 align:start position:0%
both Texas and New York regarding
 
00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:00.600 align:start position:0%
Miranda style work warnings in child
 
00:10:03.509 --> 00:10:03.519 align:start position:0%
welfare welfare cases um this suggests
 
00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:05.720 align:start position:0%
that the idea of notification of Rights
 
00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:08.200 align:start position:0%
and actually having a recognition that
 
00:10:10.269 --> 00:10:10.279 align:start position:0%
that notification of Rights has happened
 
00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:12.360 align:start position:0%
and the person understands it is an
 
00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:14.440 align:start position:0%
issue that is of significance not just
 
00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:17.560 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire but across the country
 
00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:22.040 align:start position:0%
um so in um last September um Child
 
00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:24.040 align:start position:0%
Protective Services in Texas are now
 
00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:25.560 align:start position:0%
required to read parents or
 
00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights similar to the
 
00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
Miranda Rights uh because this was a law
 
00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:32.240 align:start position:0%
enacted by the state legislature because
 
00:10:34.509 --> 00:10:34.519 align:start position:0%
there had been some um there were quite
 
00:10:36.509 --> 00:10:36.519 align:start position:0%
a few cases that were brought before
 
00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:39.160 align:start position:0%
where people were not notified of their
 
00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:41.320 align:start position:0%
rights specifically they need to be
 
00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:42.760 align:start position:0%
notified that they have a right to
 
00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
remain silent to have a lawyer present
 
00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
and to decline searches of their home or
 
00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:49.560 align:start position:0%
their children without a court order um
 
00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
this is actually one of the areas where
 
00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:53.680 align:start position:0%
there had been um a lot of disparities
 
00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
about how this was done this was
 
00:10:57.790 --> 00:10:57.800 align:start position:0%
something where lower income or um
 
00:10:59.949 --> 00:10:59.959 align:start position:0%
people that are black Hispanic and lower
 
00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:02.200 align:start position:0%
income were having significant problems
 
00:11:04.269 --> 00:11:04.279 align:start position:0%
with this um in Texas so they put this
 
00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:08.440 align:start position:0%
law into place um so this this was
 
00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:10.200 align:start position:0%
actually a similar law was in New York
 
00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:11.680 align:start position:0%
state and that one was blocked in the
 
00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:14.600 align:start position:0%
legislature so it's interesting that the
 
00:11:16.389 --> 00:11:16.399 align:start position:0%
process and the way that things go
 
00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:18.760 align:start position:0%
differ differs from state to state but
 
00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:20.920 align:start position:0%
despite uh similar challenges in New
 
00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:23.480 align:start position:0%
York um they actually did not pass that
 
00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
so this this might be an interesting um
 
00:11:27.829 --> 00:11:27.839 align:start position:0%
interesting bills to look at and see
 
00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:29.320 align:start position:0%
what these other states have done and
 
00:11:31.269 --> 00:11:31.279 align:start position:0%
order to see where our Stacks up if
 
00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:33.240 align:start position:0%
we're already more protective or if we
 
00:11:35.949 --> 00:11:35.959 align:start position:0%
can have some other improvements because
 
00:11:38.509 --> 00:11:38.519 align:start position:0%
um I I I don't know if all of you are
 
00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
having people speak to you about this
 
00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
but I've had a few people that did not
 
00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
feel that they were informed of their
 
00:11:44.269 --> 00:11:44.279 align:start position:0%
rights obviously we can have that
 
00:11:46.949 --> 00:11:46.959 align:start position:0%
testimony come in um but we do want to
 
00:11:48.949 --> 00:11:48.959 align:start position:0%
make sure that especially as people are
 
00:11:50.509 --> 00:11:50.519 align:start position:0%
entering this they understand their
 
00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:55.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
we don't I don't think we need to get
 
00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:13.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:16.790 align:start position:0%
 
point

00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
okay um and so looking forward as well
 
00:12:21.269 --> 00:12:21.279 align:start position:0%
one of the things that'll be important
 
00:12:23.189 --> 00:12:23.199 align:start position:0%
is to find out not just from testimony
 
00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:24.720 align:start position:0%
but from actual complaints that have
 
00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:26.600 align:start position:0%
been filed to understand what's
 
00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:28.240 align:start position:0%
happening um this is one where I'm
 
00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:29.800 align:start position:0%
putting request out to the office of the
 
00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
child advocate to get the records that
 
00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:33.560 align:start position:0%
they have on complaints that are related
 
00:12:36.069 --> 00:12:36.079 align:start position:0%
to Due Process um and then also to check
 
00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
if there's any other places that are
 
00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:39.160 align:start position:0%
receiving these complaints because we
 
00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:41.120 align:start position:0%
would like to compile those have them
 
00:12:43.069 --> 00:12:43.079 align:start position:0%
come in and explain any trends that they
 
00:12:45.389 --> 00:12:45.399 align:start position:0%
are seeing um so that we can look and
 
00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
make sure that this is something that is
 
00:12:59.269 --> 00:12:59.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:00.920 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm trying to find this there was
 
00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:03.720 align:start position:0%
uh one that was
 
00:13:06.629 --> 00:13:06.639 align:start position:0%
um really highlighting how important due
 
00:13:08.189 --> 00:13:08.199 align:start position:0%
process is not just for the families
 
00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:10.160 align:start position:0%
that are separated but quite a few of
 
00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:11.880 align:start position:0%
the children who were not removed from
 
00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
their homes when they should have been
 
00:13:15.509 --> 00:13:15.519 align:start position:0%
um that was an issue of due process as
 
00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:18.120 align:start position:0%
well because evidence wasn't followed up
 
00:13:20.949 --> 00:13:20.959 align:start position:0%
um there was um conflicting evidence and
 
00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
that's led to poor outcomes on both
 
00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:25.320 align:start position:0%
sides so this is one of those areas
 
00:13:27.269 --> 00:13:27.279 align:start position:0%
where we need to recognize that this is
 
00:13:30.069 --> 00:13:30.079 align:start position:0%
going to protect children and families
 
00:13:32.389 --> 00:13:32.399 align:start position:0%
all using the same tools and uh that's
 
00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:34.600 align:start position:0%
kind of a nice place to be in because if
 
00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:36.360 align:start position:0%
we can use the same same metrics in
 
00:13:37.949 --> 00:13:37.959 align:start position:0%
order to protect everybody involved
 
00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:40.440 align:start position:0%
that's absolutely key um I guess I
 
00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:41.680 align:start position:0%
wanted to see if anybody had any
 
00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
thoughts because I feel like I've been a
 
00:13:45.269 --> 00:13:45.279 align:start position:0%
wall of words representative long thank
 
00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:48.680 align:start position:0%
you uh Madam chair uh the last statement
 
00:13:51.069 --> 00:13:51.079 align:start position:0%
you made it's also uh cases are
 
00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:53.720 align:start position:0%
unfounded if you don't allow them to go
 
00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:55.360 align:start position:0%
in your house and do an interview with
 
00:13:57.749 --> 00:13:57.759 align:start position:0%
either a child or yourself so they're
 
00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:00.680 align:start position:0%
unfounded so we wouldn't be able to
 
00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:04.680 align:start position:0%
figure out uh whether it was fault on
 
00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
the agency or or it was unfounded
 
00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:11.920 align:start position:0%
because you weren't allowed to uh so so
 
00:14:13.629 --> 00:14:13.639 align:start position:0%
that's that's a
 
00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
double a double bite you know okay so
 
00:14:19.629 --> 00:14:19.639 align:start position:0%
then to follow up on that so if it is
 
00:14:21.629 --> 00:14:21.639 align:start position:0%
unfounded because they're not able to go
 
00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
into the home is that because there
 
00:14:25.749 --> 00:14:25.759 align:start position:0%
wasn't enough in evidence um in order to
 
00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
get a warrant to then go into the home
 
00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:30.120 align:start position:0%
after it was refused
 
00:14:34.269 --> 00:14:34.279 align:start position:0%
uh could be or could not be they don't
 
00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:36.720 align:start position:0%
you don't you don't have to allow them
 
00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
to interview you or the
 
00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
child uh but with a warrant they would
 
00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:45.470 align:start position:0%
child uh but with a warrant they would
correct

00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:45.480 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:14:49.629 --> 00:14:49.639 align:start position:0%
uh okay sorry okay representative Greg
 
00:14:51.389 --> 00:14:51.399 align:start position:0%
so um thank you madam chairman
 
00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
chairwoman so in order to get a warrant
 
00:14:56.069 --> 00:14:56.079 align:start position:0%
you would need when you have a a
 
00:14:58.389 --> 00:14:58.399 align:start position:0%
suspicion you need more evidence so in
 
00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
order to get more evidence in cases of
 
00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:01.880 align:start position:0%
family mistreatment you're actually
 
00:15:03.829 --> 00:15:03.839 align:start position:0%
going to need to have interviews with
 
00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
the child or the parent if they're
 
00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:07.800 align:start position:0%
saying no then that's where it stops the
 
00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:09.240 align:start position:0%
ability to get a warrant is going to
 
00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:12.800 align:start position:0%
take something more serious like um I
 
00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:14.240 align:start position:0%
mean there have been broken bones where
 
00:15:15.629 --> 00:15:15.639 align:start position:0%
they still said that they couldn't
 
00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
didn't have enough to get a warrant
 
00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:19.120 align:start position:0%
because the parent gives an excuse maybe
 
00:15:20.629 --> 00:15:20.639 align:start position:0%
in the hospitals to why it happened but
 
00:15:22.069 --> 00:15:22.079 align:start position:0%
they don't have enough evidence without
 
00:15:23.550 --> 00:15:23.560 align:start position:0%
being able to get in the house so this
 
00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:25.560 align:start position:0%
is where we're lacking due process for
 
00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:27.560 align:start position:0%
the children um because you just can't
 
00:15:30.069 --> 00:15:30.079 align:start position:0%
do it representative
 
00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
Weber and and my question is actually
 
00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:35.560 align:start position:0%
for those who are active members of the
 
00:15:39.189 --> 00:15:39.199 align:start position:0%
children and family law committee is I'm
 
00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
trying to remember about the warrant
 
00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
issue um is is it DCF that gets the
 
00:15:49.269 --> 00:15:49.279 align:start position:0%
warrant or are the warrants warrants are
 
00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
part of a criminal action DCF doesn't do
 
00:15:58.269 --> 00:15:58.279 align:start position:0%
warrants and to answer one of the issues
 
00:16:01.629 --> 00:16:01.639 align:start position:0%
that you just passed out parents now
 
00:16:03.509 --> 00:16:03.519 align:start position:0%
have the right and correct me if I'm
 
00:16:06.949 --> 00:16:06.959 align:start position:0%
wrong because I'm I'm pulling from
 
00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
various brain cells some of which may
 
00:16:12.949 --> 00:16:12.959 align:start position:0%
not be working well um if a parent meets
 
00:16:14.509 --> 00:16:14.519 align:start position:0%
you at the door and says you can't come
 
00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:17.240 align:start position:0%
in you can't come in if a parent meets
 
00:16:19.309 --> 00:16:19.319 align:start position:0%
you and says I'm not going to let you
 
00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
interview my child you have to find
 
00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:25.160 align:start position:0%
another way and that is easier if the
 
00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:28.160 align:start position:0%
child is in school you may be able to do
 
00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:31.560 align:start position:0%
it through school but I'm not sure of my
 
00:16:33.949 --> 00:16:33.959 align:start position:0%
own knowledge where the line is if the
 
00:16:36.309 --> 00:16:36.319 align:start position:0%
parent says and you're never going to
 
00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:40.440 align:start position:0%
talk to my kid every anywhere uh because
 
00:16:44.949 --> 00:16:44.959 align:start position:0%
the cases that I know about have
 
00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:48.160 align:start position:0%
involved teens at school rather than
 
00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
small children right under so I'd love
 
00:16:53.509 --> 00:16:53.519 align:start position:0%
to hear from folks about what the actual
 
00:16:56.269 --> 00:16:56.279 align:start position:0%
current standard of of things in DCF is
 
00:16:56.279 --> 00:16:57.269 align:start position:0%
current standard of of things in DCF is
about

00:16:57.269 --> 00:16:57.279 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:16:59.749 --> 00:16:59.759 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
00:17:02.829 --> 00:17:02.839 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um so with respect
 
00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:07.240 align:start position:0%
to schools uh most schools
 
00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:11.160 align:start position:0%
will ask the advice of the parent youf
 
00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:13.760 align:start position:0%
will show up I want to talk with Johnny
 
00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:15.720 align:start position:0%
Smith uh hang on a minute I'm going to
 
00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
call their parents make sure it's okay
 
00:17:19.189 --> 00:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
or some of them will just let them in so
 
00:17:20.549 --> 00:17:20.559 align:start position:0%
if they just let them in and they talk
 
00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
to the child they talk to the child uh
 
00:17:26.669 --> 00:17:26.679 align:start position:0%
but historically it's asking the parents
 
00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
and if the parent says go to the house
 
00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:31.200 align:start position:0%
first and the parent says I don't want
 
00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:33.480 align:start position:0%
you talking to my child they can't go to
 
00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
the school
 
00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:46.240 align:start position:0%
representative thank you shamman
 
00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
Lan isn't the police department have the
 
00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
right to go in and do a warrant search
 
00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:54.669 align:start position:0%
right to go in and do a warrant search
and

00:17:54.669 --> 00:17:54.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:17:57.430 --> 00:17:57.440 align:start position:0%
interview um thank you if the if they
 
00:17:59.230 --> 00:17:59.240 align:start position:0%
have enough evidence in order to have a
 
00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:02.200 align:start position:0%
judge give a warrant then yes um but
 
00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:04.640 align:start position:0%
unless they're in Pursuit I believe
 
00:18:06.549 --> 00:18:06.559 align:start position:0%
there's Pursuit for an imminent risk
 
00:18:07.909 --> 00:18:07.919 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing but otherwise they
 
00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
need a warrant in order to go in thank
 
00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
you you're welcome representative Greg
 
00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman I think this is
 
00:18:16.029 --> 00:18:16.039 align:start position:0%
probably one of those areas to get super
 
00:18:17.549 --> 00:18:17.559 align:start position:0%
specific it'd be helpful to hear from
 
00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
DCF but from the cases that I've known
 
00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:24.880 align:start position:0%
of um firsthand or experienced or seen
 
00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:27.240 align:start position:0%
the paperwork for what generally happens
 
00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:29.880 align:start position:0%
is is you have a suspect of a situation
 
00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:32.520 align:start position:0%
where a child's being uh maltreated you
 
00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
have a DCF investigation let's say
 
00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:36.360 align:start position:0%
they're able to talk to the children
 
00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:38.480 align:start position:0%
they're able to talk to the parents then
 
00:18:41.549 --> 00:18:41.559 align:start position:0%
dcyf takes a look at it and with their
 
00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:43.400 align:start position:0%
you know vast knowledge figure out okay
 
00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:44.840 align:start position:0%
is this something that we just maybe
 
00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
talk to the parents like hey this isn't
 
00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
the best form of parenting you know you
 
00:18:52.029 --> 00:18:52.039 align:start position:0%
kind of give them a warning like this is
 
00:18:55.029 --> 00:18:55.039 align:start position:0%
not this is not good because
 
00:18:57.909 --> 00:18:57.919 align:start position:0%
XYZ um there are other cases where it
 
00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:00.480 align:start position:0%
takes it to a criminal crial level uh
 
00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:02.720 align:start position:0%
where there is a criminal statute then
 
00:19:05.549 --> 00:19:05.559 align:start position:0%
dcyf will involve the police department
 
00:19:07.549 --> 00:19:07.559 align:start position:0%
but you don't have the police generally
 
00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:09.440 align:start position:0%
jumping in with warrants unless maybe
 
00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:10.400 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
fatality uh something or a missing child
 
00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:14.640 align:start position:0%
something like that even then it can
 
00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:16.720 align:start position:0%
take a little bit longer uh there's
 
00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:19.720 align:start position:0%
Extreme Caution when they talk about
 
00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:21.720 align:start position:0%
removing children from Families First of
 
00:19:24.029 --> 00:19:24.039 align:start position:0%
all it's expensive there's not a lot of
 
00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:26.360 align:start position:0%
resources so we're limited on that but
 
00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:28.480 align:start position:0%
they're very very careful so there are a
 
00:19:31.149 --> 00:19:31.159 align:start position:0%
lot lot of times where things have been
 
00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
unfounded that shouldn't have there's
 
00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
been broken bones we've heard testimony
 
00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
of babies that the explanations given is
 
00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:38.720 align:start position:0%
just not there but the parents won't let
 
00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
them investigate ultimately about the
 
00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:43.480 align:start position:0%
school thing we have rights I mean we
 
00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
have our parental rights to say you're
 
00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:48.120 align:start position:0%
not talking to my kid and if we don't
 
00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:50.120 align:start position:0%
have the insight into our own behavior
 
00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:51.880 align:start position:0%
that maybe there's something we could
 
00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
learn about it then that leaves the the
 
00:19:56.789 --> 00:19:56.799 align:start position:0%
children in a loop right now as far as
 
00:19:58.830 --> 00:19:58.840 align:start position:0%
being able to get help so it can't you
 
00:20:00.149 --> 00:20:00.159 align:start position:0%
just get a warrant because there's so
 
00:20:01.549 --> 00:20:01.559 align:start position:0%
much more that has to happen in the
 
00:20:04.549 --> 00:20:04.559 align:start position:0%
meantime so because it is there are many
 
00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:06.280 align:start position:0%
cases where they decide to not
 
00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:08.720 align:start position:0%
criminally press charges because you
 
00:20:12.669 --> 00:20:12.679 align:start position:0%
know say your okay we'll say my say my
 
00:20:15.149 --> 00:20:15.159 align:start position:0%
um parent used to take a switch from the
 
00:20:16.669 --> 00:20:16.679 align:start position:0%
backyard which they didn't by the way
 
00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:18.520 align:start position:0%
but take a switch and hit me and leave
 
00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:20.520 align:start position:0%
wels on me and I think well this is a
 
00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:22.480 align:start position:0%
great way to parent so I pass this down
 
00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:24.280 align:start position:0%
to my kids because I'm I turned out
 
00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
pretty good so I want to pass this on
 
00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
well we understand now with our new um
 
00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:32.480 align:start position:0%
way of looking at abuse and what is good
 
00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
you know what is proper parenting what
 
00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
is abusive uh that this isn't the way so
 
00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:39.480 align:start position:0%
then maybe dcyf just has a conversation
 
00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
and says did you understand this is not
 
00:20:44.149 --> 00:20:44.159 align:start position:0%
appropriate you know that happened to
 
00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:46.600 align:start position:0%
you so there are different levels of
 
00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
things but that would not necessarily be
 
00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:50.720 align:start position:0%
founded abuse it would just be a case
 
00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:52.760 align:start position:0%
where the parenting was a
 
00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:56.520 align:start position:0%
little not as if that makes sense um it
 
00:20:59.029 --> 00:20:59.039 align:start position:0%
does make some sense I'm just trying to
 
00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:00.880 align:start position:0%
I I I'm just trying to understand
 
00:21:02.909 --> 00:21:02.919 align:start position:0%
zooming out to this big picture so our
 
00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:05.240 align:start position:0%
entire thing entire system of all the
 
00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:07.400 align:start position:0%
non-criminal charges is entirely based
 
00:21:09.909 --> 00:21:09.919 align:start position:0%
on voluntary compliance and all a parent
 
00:21:12.149 --> 00:21:12.159 align:start position:0%
who's concerned about is to say instead
 
00:21:13.669 --> 00:21:13.679 align:start position:0%
of the normal thing of I have nothing to
 
00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:16.320 align:start position:0%
hide so I'm going to speak with you to
 
00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
that they're only that at this point
 
00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:19.360 align:start position:0%
their protection of their rights is to
 
00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
deny that initial
 
00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:25.360 align:start position:0%
engagement representative cor so as far
 
00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:27.720 align:start position:0%
as far as I understand in most cases yes
 
00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
now I'm not expert in this we only know
 
00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:32.440 align:start position:0%
you know what testimony we get and stuff
 
00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:34.440 align:start position:0%
the difference is sometimes you have
 
00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
parents who are divorced and so you'll
 
00:21:38.909 --> 00:21:38.919 align:start position:0%
have one the other parent pushing it
 
00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:40.120 align:start position:0%
which means that there's going to be
 
00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:41.640 align:start position:0%
more of a look into it but they're able
 
00:21:44.549 --> 00:21:44.559 align:start position:0%
to then talk to that child uh because
 
00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
they have access from the one parent so
 
00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
there are different aspects you know
 
00:21:51.789 --> 00:21:51.799 align:start position:0%
every family situation is incredibly
 
00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:53.440 align:start position:0%
different and that's why it's always so
 
00:21:54.990 --> 00:21:55.000 align:start position:0%
important to look at this like there's
 
00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
no one-size fits all there's no black
 
00:21:58.789 --> 00:21:58.799 align:start position:0%
and white situation on this but there
 
00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:00.320 align:start position:0%
are cases where there might be a
 
00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:02.440 align:start position:0%
guardian there might be somebody else
 
00:22:04.149 --> 00:22:04.159 align:start position:0%
that has access to the child to where
 
00:22:06.789 --> 00:22:06.799 align:start position:0%
they can do more of an
 
00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:09.320 align:start position:0%
investigation representative web and
 
00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:11.320 align:start position:0%
just to follow on to that I mean the two
 
00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
big ones are um uh teachers daycare
 
00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
providers who make are make reports when
 
00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:22.640 align:start position:0%
they see bruises or other things that
 
00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
are of anxiety a child who's coming in
 
00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
who isn't particularly clean um a child
 
00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:31.400 align:start position:0%
who who you know has whatever is going
 
00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:34.240 align:start position:0%
on they have to report that so that's
 
00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
one source and that can of course in in
 
00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
the case of a parent who is unwilling to
 
00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
allow access to the child or to the home
 
00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
that's one source for uh both
 
00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
information for a warrant if somebody
 
00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:52.720 align:start position:0%
believes it rises to criminal activity
 
00:22:55.149 --> 00:22:55.159 align:start position:0%
but that's a whole different proceeding
 
00:22:59.590 --> 00:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
or it is grounds for the affidavit that
 
00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:00.990 align:start position:0%
or it is grounds for the affidavit that
a

00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:01.000 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:04.640 align:start position:0%
DCF cpsw certified professional social
 
00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:07.320 align:start position:0%
worker will use for the affidavit to
 
00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
start an abuse and neglect to petition
 
00:23:14.350 --> 00:23:14.360 align:start position:0%
so teachers are one aspect uh relatives
 
00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:18.640 align:start position:0%
and um um community members are the
 
00:23:23.029 --> 00:23:23.039 align:start position:0%
other ones that are very likely to be a
 
00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
reporting party and and a cooperating
 
00:23:31.269 --> 00:23:31.279 align:start position:0%
witness I saw somebody yank the child by
 
00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
his arm and his shoulder looked like it
 
00:23:35.549 --> 00:23:35.559 align:start position:0%
was you know whatever they saw whatever
 
00:23:39.390 --> 00:23:39.400 align:start position:0%
they observed so so those are ways that
 
00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:41.640 align:start position:0%
things get reported and get started as
 
00:23:45.669 --> 00:23:45.679 align:start position:0%
an inquiry but it's really important to
 
00:23:49.149 --> 00:23:49.159 align:start position:0%
remember that there's a huge difference
 
00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:50.720 align:start position:0%
between the
 
00:23:54.269 --> 00:23:54.279 align:start position:0%
criminal investigation on the one hand
 
00:23:57.590 --> 00:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
and a dcyf abuse neglect Which is far
 
00:23:59.390 --> 00:23:59.400 align:start position:0%
more limited in what they can do and
 
00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:03.200 align:start position:0%
what they have access to so in terms of
 
00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:06.760 align:start position:0%
the concerns about parents rights I mean
 
00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:09.480 align:start position:0%
they're cpsws are not allowed to just
 
00:24:11.269 --> 00:24:11.279 align:start position:0%
storm into your house without your per
 
00:24:13.549 --> 00:24:13.559 align:start position:0%
permission and if that is happening then
 
00:24:16.789 --> 00:24:16.799 align:start position:0%
we we need to know about it um and then
 
00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:19.200 align:start position:0%
the last point that I wanted to try not
 
00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:23.080 align:start position:0%
to forget is that one of the things that
 
00:24:25.149 --> 00:24:25.159 align:start position:0%
I think we talked about in the past and
 
00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
that has come up again is the
 
00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:32.240 align:start position:0%
playay between parents who are divorcing
 
00:24:36.389 --> 00:24:36.399 align:start position:0%
and DCF and some of the time a divorcing
 
00:24:38.590 --> 00:24:38.600 align:start position:0%
parent is divorcing because they are
 
00:24:40.669 --> 00:24:40.679 align:start position:0%
very concerned about the behavior of the
 
00:24:44.789 --> 00:24:44.799 align:start position:0%
other parent and rightly so and
 
00:24:46.669 --> 00:24:46.679 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's
 
00:24:46.679 --> 00:24:49.510 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's
because

00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
um a a parent has decided to weaponize
 
00:24:58.070 --> 00:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
DCF and the DCF process and again just
 
00:24:58.080 --> 00:24:59.310 align:start position:0%
DCF and the DCF process and again just
as

00:24:59.310 --> 00:24:59.320 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
that there is that tension
 
00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:04.720 align:start position:0%
between oh did we take a kid out of the
 
00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:07.240 align:start position:0%
house too soon or did we leave a kid in
 
00:25:10.029 --> 00:25:10.039 align:start position:0%
the house too long there's also that
 
00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:12.880 align:start position:0%
tension about is this one of these cases
 
00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
where um a parent a child is genuinely
 
00:25:19.269 --> 00:25:19.279 align:start position:0%
in danger or a parent is weaponizing
 
00:25:22.789 --> 00:25:22.799 align:start position:0%
dcyf and like the Serenity Prayer the
 
00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
hard part is the wisdom to know the
 
00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
difference and we are calling on
 
00:25:32.110 --> 00:25:32.120 align:start position:0%
incredibly caring individuals to try and
 
00:25:35.269 --> 00:25:35.279 align:start position:0%
make that determination and that's often
 
00:25:38.590 --> 00:25:38.600 align:start position:0%
the really hard part um so with that and
 
00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:40.640 align:start position:0%
the divorce ones would it make sense to
 
00:25:44.269 --> 00:25:44.279 align:start position:0%
sort of think of them as um having DCF
 
00:25:46.350 --> 00:25:46.360 align:start position:0%
involved for a protective reason or
 
00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:47.960 align:start position:0%
having them involved as a strategic
 
00:25:49.549 --> 00:25:49.559 align:start position:0%
reason just to sort of have it in our
 
00:25:51.149 --> 00:25:51.159 align:start position:0%
mindset to think in divorce there's
 
00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:52.480 align:start position:0%
either a protective reason or a
 
00:25:55.710 --> 00:25:55.720 align:start position:0%
strategic reason well I I think that's
 
00:25:57.750 --> 00:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
how how the divorcing parent is using
 
00:25:59.669 --> 00:25:59.679 align:start position:0%
them yes I I think that's a very
 
00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
accurate description and it could blur
 
00:26:04.110 --> 00:26:04.120 align:start position:0%
at times I recognize too so um at least
 
00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:05.720 align:start position:0%
if we have that nomenclature to be able
 
00:26:07.269 --> 00:26:07.279 align:start position:0%
to look at these when there's a divorce
 
00:26:09.870 --> 00:26:09.880 align:start position:0%
involved and and I think that that also
 
00:26:12.149 --> 00:26:12.159 align:start position:0%
informs as we go
 
00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
forward um the testimony that you will
 
00:26:18.750 --> 00:26:18.760 align:start position:0%
take in the public portion of the
 
00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:22.120 align:start position:0%
um hearing we got a little blurred in
 
00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
some of the earlier hearings about all
 
00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:27.960 align:start position:0%
kinds of different proceedings that
 
00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:31.240 align:start position:0%
involve parents and courts and so I
 
00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
think that at this point it's it's our
 
00:26:39.430 --> 00:26:39.440 align:start position:0%
time to focus very clearly on um those
 
00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:43.120 align:start position:0%
times if we're talking about uh divorce
 
00:26:44.830 --> 00:26:44.840 align:start position:0%
courts we're talking about those two
 
00:26:46.510 --> 00:26:46.520 align:start position:0%
kinds of procedures specifically we're
 
00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:48.120 align:start position:0%
not talking globally about people's
 
00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:51.760 align:start position:0%
divorces which is a whole another can of
 
00:26:54.549 --> 00:26:54.559 align:start position:0%
worms yes thank you um I had had
 
00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:56.240 align:start position:0%
representative panck then representative
 
00:26:58.870 --> 00:26:58.880 align:start position:0%
wner then representative Cal
 
00:27:01.669 --> 00:27:01.679 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman um what I like to be
 
00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:03.640 align:start position:0%
able to tease out with the committee
 
00:27:06.029 --> 00:27:06.039 align:start position:0%
work that we're doing is right now we
 
00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
have a system that um we have family
 
00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
court is based on hearsay evidence
 
00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:17.200 align:start position:0%
rather than on fact-based
 
00:27:20.110 --> 00:27:20.120 align:start position:0%
evidence and when you're going through a
 
00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:21.760 align:start position:0%
very contentious
 
00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
divorce sometimes you will
 
00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:29.440 align:start position:0%
hear about these attorneys that will
 
00:27:32.909 --> 00:27:32.919 align:start position:0%
advise their clients to make a false
 
00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
claim in order to remove the child from
 
00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
the father's custody or whatever I know
 
00:27:42.149 --> 00:27:42.159 align:start position:0%
of several cases and personally it's
 
00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:46.600 align:start position:0%
touched my family um so criminal
 
00:27:49.029 --> 00:27:49.039 align:start position:0%
criminal law is based on
 
00:27:52.389 --> 00:27:52.399 align:start position:0%
facts where family court is based on
 
00:27:56.950 --> 00:27:56.960 align:start position:0%
heay evidence how do we fix that that's
 
00:27:59.870 --> 00:27:59.880 align:start position:0%
where I think things are getting
 
00:28:02.789 --> 00:28:02.799 align:start position:0%
convoluted um thank you so I think
 
00:28:04.549 --> 00:28:04.559 align:start position:0%
that's also one of the issues of where
 
00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:06.880 align:start position:0%
then we get to the court procedures and
 
00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
that is pro that's something more for
 
00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:10.480 align:start position:0%
the special committee on the family
 
00:28:12.149 --> 00:28:12.159 align:start position:0%
court for those court procedures but
 
00:28:13.669 --> 00:28:13.679 align:start position:0%
that does also come back to the due
 
00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:16.240 align:start position:0%
process and the fact that if you're not
 
00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
able to confront your accuser are those
 
00:28:20.389 --> 00:28:20.399 align:start position:0%
sort of questions too so this is where
 
00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:22.240 align:start position:0%
it sort of blurs the lines if that's an
 
00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:24.640 align:start position:0%
response representative Weber that
 
00:28:26.269 --> 00:28:26.279 align:start position:0%
that's correct and I think the other
 
00:28:28.750 --> 00:28:28.760 align:start position:0%
thing is that if there is an attorney
 
00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:31.200 align:start position:0%
out there who is advising a client to
 
00:28:34.029 --> 00:28:34.039 align:start position:0%
make false claims that should be
 
00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
reported to the attorney's conduct
 
00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:39.640 align:start position:0%
Commission because that is never
 
00:28:42.549 --> 00:28:42.559 align:start position:0%
appropriate conduct for an attorney so
 
00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:44.960 align:start position:0%
if if there are people who are doing it
 
00:28:47.269 --> 00:28:47.279 align:start position:0%
that's grounds for attorney discipline
 
00:28:50.430 --> 00:28:50.440 align:start position:0%
entirely outside of the court
 
00:28:54.430 --> 00:28:54.440 align:start position:0%
system representative Ware yes um so I I
 
00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:56.120 align:start position:0%
have missed a couple of meetings so I
 
00:28:58.750 --> 00:28:58.760 align:start position:0%
may have a little catching up to do here
 
00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
um but one question I have is as we
 
00:29:03.870 --> 00:29:03.880 align:start position:0%
proceed are we going to have the
 
00:29:06.269 --> 00:29:06.279 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:09.640 align:start position:0%
specifically DCF come in and talk to us
 
00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:13.240 align:start position:0%
and walk through some of the proceed
 
00:29:16.389 --> 00:29:16.399 align:start position:0%
procedures and be an opportunity for us
 
00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
to ask them questions about the
 
00:29:21.149 --> 00:29:21.159 align:start position:0%
procedures and how they how they how
 
00:29:23.710 --> 00:29:23.720 align:start position:0%
they handle these cases thank you that's
 
00:29:25.350 --> 00:29:25.360 align:start position:0%
a great question that is absolutely one
 
00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:27.480 align:start position:0%
of the key goals of this committee um
 
00:29:29.710 --> 00:29:29.720 align:start position:0%
with their change between the current
 
00:29:32.149 --> 00:29:32.159 align:start position:0%
DCF director leaving and now having an
 
00:29:34.389 --> 00:29:34.399 align:start position:0%
interim that makes it more challenging
 
00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
but it also may give us a good
 
00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:38.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity because nobody was here who
 
00:29:40.669 --> 00:29:40.679 align:start position:0%
was making those decisions so sometimes
 
00:29:42.149 --> 00:29:42.159 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit easier to look back
 
00:29:44.149 --> 00:29:44.159 align:start position:0%
and check somebody else's work when it's
 
00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:46.200 align:start position:0%
not your work that's being checked um
 
00:29:47.789 --> 00:29:47.799 align:start position:0%
but I think that's also a reason why we
 
00:29:49.509 --> 00:29:49.519 align:start position:0%
need to make sure we're focused on the
 
00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:51.720 align:start position:0%
policies and not the people so we can
 
00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:53.480 align:start position:0%
look at the policies and what the
 
00:29:55.070 --> 00:29:55.080 align:start position:0%
policies are and how they protect
 
00:29:57.269 --> 00:29:57.279 align:start position:0%
without getting too personalized and
 
00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:00.480 align:start position:0%
making it um be too emotional so that we
 
00:30:01.789 --> 00:30:01.799 align:start position:0%
can actually get to the fact so we can
 
00:30:03.789 --> 00:30:03.799 align:start position:0%
protect families going
 
00:30:06.389 --> 00:30:06.399 align:start position:0%
forward yes so I'm also hoping that you
 
00:30:09.789 --> 00:30:09.799 align:start position:0%
will invite the child advocate and um
 
00:30:12.029 --> 00:30:12.039 align:start position:0%
the staff in the child advocate's office
 
00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
to talk about what they're seeing um yes
 
00:30:17.230 --> 00:30:17.240 align:start position:0%
thank you my hope would be that um for
 
00:30:18.830 --> 00:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
scheduling a meeting next week hopefully
 
00:30:20.029 --> 00:30:20.039 align:start position:0%
we can get the office of the child
 
00:30:21.509 --> 00:30:21.519 align:start position:0%
advocate in and they can start getting
 
00:30:23.029 --> 00:30:23.039 align:start position:0%
us some of the information about the
 
00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:25.080 align:start position:0%
complaints that they receive um and then
 
00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:27.200 align:start position:0%
also reach out to dcyf in order to get
 
00:30:29.310 --> 00:30:29.320 align:start position:0%
them to come in and also let us know
 
00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:31.240 align:start position:0%
about what that complaint procedure is
 
00:30:33.549 --> 00:30:33.559 align:start position:0%
and what they're seeing as well um and
 
00:30:35.630 --> 00:30:35.640 align:start position:0%
also whatever policies they do have
 
00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
specifically that they see I think a lot
 
00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:39.200 align:start position:0%
of this if we start looking at sort of
 
00:30:40.789 --> 00:30:40.799 align:start position:0%
the intake as people are first being
 
00:30:42.870 --> 00:30:42.880 align:start position:0%
introduced to this process and
 
00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:44.600 align:start position:0%
evaluating the due process there then
 
00:30:46.350 --> 00:30:46.360 align:start position:0%
it'll be easier as we move forward as
 
00:30:48.909 --> 00:30:48.919 align:start position:0%
well so thank you representative Kofa
 
00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:51.200 align:start position:0%
and then representative
 
00:30:53.990 --> 00:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
long thank you so you know we've we've
 
00:30:55.789 --> 00:30:55.799 align:start position:0%
heard several comments about the
 
00:30:58.710 --> 00:30:58.720 align:start position:0%
distinction between a criminal case and
 
00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
a um a case of abuse and neglect um
 
00:31:05.629 --> 00:31:05.639 align:start position:0%
which is a
 
00:31:09.549 --> 00:31:09.559 align:start position:0%
crime yet I guess my concern is that if
 
00:31:11.470 --> 00:31:11.480 align:start position:0%
you look at this from the perspective of
 
00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
a parent who is under investigation or
 
00:31:16.389 --> 00:31:16.399 align:start position:0%
potentially under
 
00:31:19.190 --> 00:31:19.200 align:start position:0%
investigation um it's a distinction with
 
00:31:21.789 --> 00:31:21.799 align:start position:0%
very little difference um if you are
 
00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:23.840 align:start position:0%
being deprived of a liberty interest if
 
00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:26.360 align:start position:0%
you are being deprived of your
 
00:31:29.710 --> 00:31:29.720 align:start position:0%
children potentially
 
00:31:33.549 --> 00:31:33.559 align:start position:0%
as we heard one person um I I believe we
 
00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:36.200 align:start position:0%
heard one person testify I would you
 
00:31:39.190 --> 00:31:39.200 align:start position:0%
know I I would rather go to jail than to
 
00:31:41.909 --> 00:31:41.919 align:start position:0%
have my children taken out of my
 
00:31:41.919 --> 00:31:43.830 align:start position:0%
have my children taken out of my
home

00:31:43.830 --> 00:31:43.840 align:start position:0%
home
 
00:31:47.149 --> 00:31:47.159 align:start position:0%
um fundamental rights are not something
 
00:31:50.629 --> 00:31:50.639 align:start position:0%
that we negotiate away when there's an
 
00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
emergency or an you know something
 
00:31:56.110 --> 00:31:56.120 align:start position:0%
especially important and and so this is
 
00:31:58.830 --> 00:31:58.840 align:start position:0%
my concern is that there is a
 
00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
um there there's a point at which I
 
00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
think we need to establish that
 
00:32:04.549 --> 00:32:04.559 align:start position:0%
fundamental rights are fundamental
 
00:32:04.559 --> 00:32:05.710 align:start position:0%
fundamental rights are fundamental
rights

00:32:05.710 --> 00:32:05.720 align:start position:0%
rights
 
00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:07.950 align:start position:0%
rights
period

00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:07.960 align:start position:0%
period
 
00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:11.480 align:start position:0%
um to me it does seem that a
 
00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
warrant is is appropriate under certain
 
00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:18.240 align:start position:0%
circumstances it it may be appropriate
 
00:32:20.549 --> 00:32:20.559 align:start position:0%
that we need a a faster more efficient
 
00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
process for that um but I would also
 
00:32:26.629 --> 00:32:26.639 align:start position:0%
point out that the process I I I have
 
00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
heard from constituents about cases
 
00:32:32.509 --> 00:32:32.519 align:start position:0%
where the process itself was harmful to
 
00:32:37.389 --> 00:32:37.399 align:start position:0%
the child um in cases where um there was
 
00:32:39.070 --> 00:32:39.080 align:start position:0%
the child was not taken out of the home
 
00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
there was a threat that the child was
 
00:32:42.509 --> 00:32:42.519 align:start position:0%
going to be removed from the home there
 
00:32:44.590 --> 00:32:44.600 align:start position:0%
were very very lengthy inexpensive Court
 
00:32:47.029 --> 00:32:47.039 align:start position:0%
proceedings and the finding was that
 
00:32:49.629 --> 00:32:49.639 align:start position:0%
there's no finding here there's you know
 
00:32:52.509 --> 00:32:52.519 align:start position:0%
there's no fault here
 
00:32:55.789 --> 00:32:55.799 align:start position:0%
um in that case that child is still
 
00:32:58.590 --> 00:32:58.600 align:start position:0%
experiencing Trauma from the process
 
00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
so so the trauma to the child Cuts both
 
00:33:05.029 --> 00:33:05.039 align:start position:0%
ways I think a a process in which a
 
00:33:07.389 --> 00:33:07.399 align:start position:0%
warrant is required does a couple of
 
00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
things one is that um it puts the
 
00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:12.720 align:start position:0%
breakes on that potential
 
00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
scenario um another is that I think it
 
00:33:17.350 --> 00:33:17.360 align:start position:0%
puts the breakes on this
 
00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:20.240 align:start position:0%
weaponization of dcyf and and reports I
 
00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
spoke to another constituent who said
 
00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
well you know my uh my my boyfriend's
 
00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
ex-wife um does not make false reports
 
00:33:33.549 --> 00:33:33.559 align:start position:0%
but always seems to have conversations
 
00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:36.760 align:start position:0%
with people who are mandatory reporters
 
00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:38.269 align:start position:0%
with people who are mandatory reporters
and

00:33:38.269 --> 00:33:38.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:33:41.470 --> 00:33:41.480 align:start position:0%
um she's made you know something like 20
 
00:33:44.389 --> 00:33:44.399 align:start position:0%
reports so far and 20 out of 20 have
 
00:33:46.990 --> 00:33:47.000 align:start position:0%
been found to have absolutely no basis
 
00:33:50.950 --> 00:33:50.960 align:start position:0%
in fact um this is consuming bandwidth
 
00:33:53.310 --> 00:33:53.320 align:start position:0%
this is consuming bandwidth for
 
00:33:58.190 --> 00:33:58.200 align:start position:0%
DCF um investigators who um quite
 
00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
honestly um have a lot to do we keep
 
00:34:04.950 --> 00:34:04.960 align:start position:0%
hearing that um they are they have very
 
00:34:08.430 --> 00:34:08.440 align:start position:0%
burdensome Cas loads um
 
00:34:10.909 --> 00:34:10.919 align:start position:0%
and in every case they've kind of come
 
00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:13.200 align:start position:0%
out of this saying yep we we understand
 
00:34:15.349 --> 00:34:15.359 align:start position:0%
what's really going on here there we we
 
00:34:16.990 --> 00:34:17.000 align:start position:0%
have found that there is no finding and
 
00:34:19.710 --> 00:34:19.720 align:start position:0%
yet dcyf has said you know we cannot
 
00:34:23.470 --> 00:34:23.480 align:start position:0%
assign the same person to you know to to
 
00:34:26.430 --> 00:34:26.440 align:start position:0%
this case that was on it last time so I
 
00:34:30.069 --> 00:34:30.079 align:start position:0%
I I guess I you know my my concern is
 
00:34:33.069 --> 00:34:33.079 align:start position:0%
that we recognize that fundamental
 
00:34:35.349 --> 00:34:35.359 align:start position:0%
rights constitutional rights are are in
 
00:34:39.950 --> 00:34:39.960 align:start position:0%
our constitution because they they are
 
00:34:42.829 --> 00:34:42.839 align:start position:0%
that important and so to me it seems
 
00:34:44.349 --> 00:34:44.359 align:start position:0%
that this discussion
 
00:34:49.109 --> 00:34:49.119 align:start position:0%
about um about warrants is I I I hear
 
00:34:51.349 --> 00:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
that side I I am offering the other side
 
00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:53.200 align:start position:0%
which is I I I really don't think that
 
00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:54.720 align:start position:0%
that is something that we can negotiate
 
00:34:56.550 --> 00:34:56.560 align:start position:0%
away if we're talking about due process
 
00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:58.349 align:start position:0%
away if we're talking about due process
here

00:34:58.349 --> 00:34:58.359 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:34:59.550 --> 00:34:59.560 align:start position:0%
I'm representative long and then
 
00:35:01.109 --> 00:35:01.119 align:start position:0%
representative Weber thank you madam
 
00:35:04.190 --> 00:35:04.200 align:start position:0%
chair uh I I would just caution us to
 
00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
keep separate dcyf in courts because I I
 
00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
think we're going to Cloud up the
 
00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
subject we're focused on DCF let's let's
 
00:35:14.430 --> 00:35:14.440 align:start position:0%
see it and I think there's plenty uh
 
00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
with respect to Du uh diligence that uh
 
00:35:19.470 --> 00:35:19.480 align:start position:0%
we've already discussed that we could
 
00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:23.440 align:start position:0%
look into um and again we're we're all
 
00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:26.560 align:start position:0%
uh mandatory mandatory reporters and I
 
00:35:29.910 --> 00:35:29.920 align:start position:0%
know speaking with DC YF that I think
 
00:35:33.829 --> 00:35:33.839 align:start position:0%
the number was 10 the same person
 
00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
filing complaints uh they talk with that
 
00:35:39.390 --> 00:35:39.400 align:start position:0%
person um I don't know if there's
 
00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
anything further they could do uh you
 
00:35:44.069 --> 00:35:44.079 align:start position:0%
know could they charge that person with
 
00:35:46.829 --> 00:35:46.839 align:start position:0%
falsifying I don't know what that love
 
00:35:50.230 --> 00:35:50.240 align:start position:0%
of bar is um and with respect to
 
00:35:54.910 --> 00:35:54.920 align:start position:0%
warrants again the DCF uh doesn't get
 
00:35:58.710 --> 00:35:58.720 align:start position:0%
warrant um it's Criminal court that gets
 
00:36:02.230 --> 00:36:02.240 align:start position:0%
the warrants representative Weber but
 
00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
but to follow on to representative long
 
00:36:06.670 --> 00:36:06.680 align:start position:0%
and representative Coal's comments
 
00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:08.560 align:start position:0%
although they don't start with warrants
 
00:36:10.829 --> 00:36:10.839 align:start position:0%
unless they're calling the police
 
00:36:12.589 --> 00:36:12.599 align:start position:0%
because there's criminal stuff that
 
00:36:15.470 --> 00:36:15.480 align:start position:0%
needs to be investigated right now what
 
00:36:20.069 --> 00:36:20.079 align:start position:0%
does happen is that a DCF proceeding in
 
00:36:22.309 --> 00:36:22.319 align:start position:0%
the court so I'm just talking about the
 
00:36:22.319 --> 00:36:23.910 align:start position:0%
the court so I'm just talking about the
DCF

00:36:23.910 --> 00:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
DCF
 
00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
proceedings start with three
 
00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
hearings one right after the other the
 
00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
first is a preliminary hearing and
 
00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:36.280 align:start position:0%
that's really in the nature of what
 
00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
would be called a probable cause hearing
 
00:36:42.589 --> 00:36:42.599 align:start position:0%
in a criminal case it's where the
 
00:36:46.349 --> 00:36:46.359 align:start position:0%
department has to present by
 
00:36:46.359 --> 00:36:47.950 align:start position:0%
department has to present by
affidavit

00:36:47.950 --> 00:36:47.960 align:start position:0%
affidavit
 
00:36:53.109 --> 00:36:53.119 align:start position:0%
their uh case for why this is a case of
 
00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
abuse and neglect and it gets then
 
00:36:59.750 --> 00:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
reviewed by a judge so that's the
 
00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
preliminary then this and and at all of
 
00:37:06.870 --> 00:37:06.880 align:start position:0%
these there is an appointed attorney for
 
00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:08.440 align:start position:0%
the parents so the parents are not
 
00:37:11.470 --> 00:37:11.480 align:start position:0%
standing there with no counsel at all
 
00:37:14.430 --> 00:37:14.440 align:start position:0%
second there's an adjudicatory hearing
 
00:37:17.550 --> 00:37:17.560 align:start position:0%
at which the department has the burden
 
00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:18.589 align:start position:0%
at which the department has the burden
of

00:37:18.589 --> 00:37:18.599 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:37:18.599 --> 00:37:20.589 align:start position:0%
of
proving

00:37:20.589 --> 00:37:20.599 align:start position:0%
proving
 
00:37:24.870 --> 00:37:24.880 align:start position:0%
that abuse or neglect has happened and
 
00:37:27.069 --> 00:37:27.079 align:start position:0%
that's entirely on the department the
 
00:37:28.829 --> 00:37:28.839 align:start position:0%
parent does doesn't have to present
 
00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
anything the department has to make that
 
00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
case and then the third hearing is
 
00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
called a dispositional hearing and that
 
00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:38.040 align:start position:0%
is the hearing at
 
00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:42.640 align:start position:0%
which uh both parties uh present
 
00:37:44.430 --> 00:37:44.440 align:start position:0%
evidence should they choose to do so
 
00:37:46.309 --> 00:37:46.319 align:start position:0%
they're often done by agreement of the
 
00:37:50.990 --> 00:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
parties but um and a plan is made you
 
00:37:53.870 --> 00:37:53.880 align:start position:0%
know these thing steps have to be taken
 
00:37:56.069 --> 00:37:56.079 align:start position:0%
for this child to be kept safe and that
 
00:37:57.990 --> 00:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
may be removal from the home
 
00:38:00.390 --> 00:38:00.400 align:start position:0%
it may be keeping the child in the home
 
00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:02.560 align:start position:0%
and it may be evaluations by
 
00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:05.240 align:start position:0%
professionals whatever it could be but
 
00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
that plan is then set out after that
 
00:38:11.109 --> 00:38:11.119 align:start position:0%
third hearing and then there is a
 
00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:14.040 align:start position:0%
further hearing every three months for a
 
00:38:16.990 --> 00:38:17.000 align:start position:0%
year for the parents to
 
00:38:20.589 --> 00:38:20.599 align:start position:0%
comply with the conditions that were
 
00:38:22.950 --> 00:38:22.960 align:start position:0%
either set out by the court or agreed to
 
00:38:27.109 --> 00:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
by the parents to ensure that the child
 
00:38:32.829 --> 00:38:32.839 align:start position:0%
is being kept safe or that um you know
 
00:38:34.950 --> 00:38:34.960 align:start position:0%
the parents making good progress or
 
00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
they're not making any progress and and
 
00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:40.720 align:start position:0%
so there's Court oversight all the way
 
00:38:43.150 --> 00:38:43.160 align:start position:0%
through and then it's not till the end
 
00:38:47.790 --> 00:38:47.800 align:start position:0%
of an entire year that if in fact the
 
00:38:50.069 --> 00:38:50.079 align:start position:0%
parents are not
 
00:38:52.990 --> 00:38:53.000 align:start position:0%
progressing you have an entirely
 
00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
separate proceeding called determination
 
00:38:56.790 --> 00:38:56.800 align:start position:0%
of parental rights if you get to that
 
00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:58.030 align:start position:0%
of parental rights if you get to that
point

00:38:58.030 --> 00:38:58.040 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:39:00.750 --> 00:39:00.760 align:start position:0%
but with any luck we haven't gotten to
 
00:39:02.589 --> 00:39:02.599 align:start position:0%
that point but but there are cases where
 
00:39:06.270 --> 00:39:06.280 align:start position:0%
that's necessary so there's a lot of
 
00:39:09.150 --> 00:39:09.160 align:start position:0%
process already built in and and I think
 
00:39:12.150 --> 00:39:12.160 align:start position:0%
understanding that is helpful so
 
00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:14.240 align:start position:0%
although yes there aren't warrants there
 
00:39:15.829 --> 00:39:15.839 align:start position:0%
is an early
 
00:39:20.309 --> 00:39:20.319 align:start position:0%
review um and
 
00:39:25.470 --> 00:39:25.480 align:start position:0%
um that's one of the many places where a
 
00:39:27.950 --> 00:39:27.960 align:start position:0%
report could be unfounded I mean
 
00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes you report it to dcyf and they
 
00:39:33.950 --> 00:39:33.960 align:start position:0%
say yeah that's not abuse and that's not
 
00:39:37.270 --> 00:39:37.280 align:start position:0%
neglect go home the second would be they
 
00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:40.520 align:start position:0%
do an investigation and say we can't
 
00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:42.720 align:start position:0%
substantiate any of the things that were
 
00:39:44.870 --> 00:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
said in which case they have to close
 
00:39:48.910 --> 00:39:48.920 align:start position:0%
the case um and it's not till after that
 
00:39:50.910 --> 00:39:50.920 align:start position:0%
happens so those two could be unfounded
 
00:39:55.710 --> 00:39:55.720 align:start position:0%
for those reasons um and then if you go
 
00:39:58.630 --> 00:39:58.640 align:start position:0%
to court sometimes the court say says G
 
00:40:02.309 --> 00:40:02.319 align:start position:0%
if this is your best shot cpsw this does
 
00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
not amount to U abuse neglect and we're
 
00:40:08.510 --> 00:40:08.520 align:start position:0%
going to dismiss your
 
00:40:10.630 --> 00:40:10.640 align:start position:0%
petition um thank you so my first
 
00:40:12.349 --> 00:40:12.359 align:start position:0%
question would be in those preliminary
 
00:40:14.190 --> 00:40:14.200 align:start position:0%
hearings um who is the appointed
 
00:40:17.150 --> 00:40:17.160 align:start position:0%
attorney paid paid by
 
00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
um the parent if the parent has assets
 
00:40:23.309 --> 00:40:23.319 align:start position:0%
and um uh appointed I guess by the
 
00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
judicial Council if they
 
00:40:28.309 --> 00:40:28.319 align:start position:0%
don't and sorry and then is a J judicial
 
00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
councel part of the family court process
 
00:40:34.150 --> 00:40:34.160 align:start position:0%
or is it separate and outside of
 
00:40:38.430 --> 00:40:38.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:41.829 --> 00:40:41.839 align:start position:0%
separate it's sort of a an an adjunct to
 
00:40:44.430 --> 00:40:44.440 align:start position:0%
the court system but it's
 
00:40:48.910 --> 00:40:48.920 align:start position:0%
it's it's the arm that is charged with
 
00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
providing attorneys for people who can't
 
00:40:53.790 --> 00:40:53.800 align:start position:0%
afford them sorry okay and then if the
 
00:40:55.550 --> 00:40:55.560 align:start position:0%
parents able to pay it's still an
 
00:40:57.349 --> 00:40:57.359 align:start position:0%
appointed attorney that who they then
 
00:40:58.790 --> 00:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
pay for that's been recommended if a
 
00:41:00.670 --> 00:41:00.680 align:start position:0%
parent is paying for an attorney they
 
00:41:03.309 --> 00:41:03.319 align:start position:0%
can pick whoever they want to pick okay
 
00:41:05.109 --> 00:41:05.119 align:start position:0%
so I think this is probably something
 
00:41:08.030 --> 00:41:08.040 align:start position:0%
that um I want to dig into this and the
 
00:41:09.950 --> 00:41:09.960 align:start position:0%
specifics about that appointed attorney
 
00:41:12.270 --> 00:41:12.280 align:start position:0%
what ecosystem that works in if that
 
00:41:13.910 --> 00:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
funding stream is tied to the other
 
00:41:15.630 --> 00:41:15.640 align:start position:0%
funding streams and to understand
 
00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
because one of the big trends that came
 
00:41:19.630 --> 00:41:19.640 align:start position:0%
through all of it was having the
 
00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:22.240 align:start position:0%
independence because if you're too close
 
00:41:24.470 --> 00:41:24.480 align:start position:0%
together in this process then that that
 
00:41:26.750 --> 00:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
could have the potential of appearance
 
00:41:28.589 --> 00:41:28.599 align:start position:0%
of conflict of interest and we want to
 
00:41:29.910 --> 00:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
make sure that's not the case and I'll
 
00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
just I'll just say as an answer to that
 
00:41:36.109 --> 00:41:36.119 align:start position:0%
um the cases that I know about which is
 
00:41:40.750 --> 00:41:40.760 align:start position:0%
not many um the the attorneys who are
 
00:41:43.630 --> 00:41:43.640 align:start position:0%
appointed have been attorneys who are
 
00:41:46.309 --> 00:41:46.319 align:start position:0%
attorneys in private practice they're
 
00:41:48.510 --> 00:41:48.520 align:start position:0%
they're not some and I don't know if it
 
00:41:50.309 --> 00:41:50.319 align:start position:0%
may be different in other places but
 
00:41:52.670 --> 00:41:52.680 align:start position:0%
where in my part of the state it's an
 
00:41:55.030 --> 00:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
attorney who is in private practice who
 
00:41:57.309 --> 00:41:57.319 align:start position:0%
has made themselves available for this
 
00:42:01.829 --> 00:42:01.839 align:start position:0%
kind of work but it is not they're not
 
00:42:03.870 --> 00:42:03.880 align:start position:0%
contracted you know their whole
 
00:42:06.190 --> 00:42:06.200 align:start position:0%
livelihood does not come from this they
 
00:42:08.190 --> 00:42:08.200 align:start position:0%
they have an independent practice and so
 
00:42:09.270 --> 00:42:09.280 align:start position:0%
with that we'll probably want to look
 
00:42:11.390 --> 00:42:11.400 align:start position:0%
into their independent contractor status
 
00:42:14.270 --> 00:42:14.280 align:start position:0%
just like how the um IRS if you do too
 
00:42:15.630 --> 00:42:15.640 align:start position:0%
much of your work with somebody doesn't
 
00:42:17.589 --> 00:42:17.599 align:start position:0%
see you as independent so I'd be curious
 
00:42:19.750 --> 00:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
what the percentage of these cases are
 
00:42:22.349 --> 00:42:22.359 align:start position:0%
for these attorneys representive Greg
 
00:42:23.589 --> 00:42:23.599 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairwoman I think
 
00:42:26.030 --> 00:42:26.040 align:start position:0%
another thing um important to remember
 
00:42:27.510 --> 00:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
is we have legislation that's been
 
00:42:30.030 --> 00:42:30.040 align:start position:0%
moving through the house this year on
 
00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:34.240 align:start position:0%
both the um uh false reporting making
 
00:42:36.190 --> 00:42:36.200 align:start position:0%
that more of a a criminal charge and
 
00:42:38.069 --> 00:42:38.079 align:start position:0%
then also I think that's already passed
 
00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:39.040 align:start position:0%
through I don't know where that's at in
 
00:42:41.069 --> 00:42:41.079 align:start position:0%
the Senate we have a bill that passed
 
00:42:42.349 --> 00:42:42.359 align:start position:0%
through the house and now we have the
 
00:42:44.510 --> 00:42:44.520 align:start position:0%
Senate bill with the same thing getting
 
00:42:47.309 --> 00:42:47.319 align:start position:0%
representation for um minors who are at
 
00:42:49.069 --> 00:42:49.079 align:start position:0%
risk of being removed from their homes
 
00:42:51.190 --> 00:42:51.200 align:start position:0%
so that's another level so as we're
 
00:42:53.109 --> 00:42:53.119 align:start position:0%
looking into some of these things um
 
00:42:54.549 --> 00:42:54.559 align:start position:0%
it's good to keep in mind What
 
00:42:56.710 --> 00:42:56.720 align:start position:0%
legislation is already happening that we
 
00:42:58.430 --> 00:42:58.440 align:start position:0%
have already seen issues and we're
 
00:43:01.150 --> 00:43:01.160 align:start position:0%
working on um trying to remedy some of
 
00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
those situations so some of these
 
00:43:04.870 --> 00:43:04.880 align:start position:0%
problems are already in process of
 
00:43:07.309 --> 00:43:07.319 align:start position:0%
getting looked at uh thank you and also
 
00:43:08.829 --> 00:43:08.839 align:start position:0%
looking at everything else we have in
 
00:43:10.270 --> 00:43:10.280 align:start position:0%
progress making sure it's headed in the
 
00:43:12.990 --> 00:43:13.000 align:start position:0%
right direction as well um that my
 
00:43:15.270 --> 00:43:15.280 align:start position:0%
question is about as we move to
 
00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:17.640 align:start position:0%
termination of parental rights I know
 
00:43:20.430 --> 00:43:20.440 align:start position:0%
that there um was Federal legislation
 
00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
under Clinton which spoke to the amount
 
00:43:24.750 --> 00:43:24.760 align:start position:0%
of time somebody could be in foster care
 
00:43:26.790 --> 00:43:26.800 align:start position:0%
before they were removed do we know how
 
00:43:28.829 --> 00:43:28.839 align:start position:0%
long that termination of parental rates
 
00:43:31.069 --> 00:43:31.079 align:start position:0%
happens takes once it comes into play
 
00:43:34.630 --> 00:43:34.640 align:start position:0%
representative Weber well the federal
 
00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:39.760 align:start position:0%
requirements are that a parent have a
 
00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:42.309 align:start position:0%
requirements are that a parent have a
year

00:43:42.309 --> 00:43:42.319 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:43:42.319 --> 00:43:44.230 align:start position:0%
year
to

00:43:44.230 --> 00:43:44.240 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:43:47.470 --> 00:43:47.480 align:start position:0%
comply and and and to make the changes
 
00:43:51.589 --> 00:43:51.599 align:start position:0%
necessary for a child to be at home
 
00:43:54.349 --> 00:43:54.359 align:start position:0%
unsupervised I know that the trend and I
 
00:43:56.270 --> 00:43:56.280 align:start position:0%
don't have statistics on this but I know
 
00:43:57.790 --> 00:43:57.800 align:start position:0%
that the trend
 
00:44:00.630 --> 00:44:00.640 align:start position:0%
has been over the last eight or 10 years
 
00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
that I've been involved in various ways
 
00:44:05.950 --> 00:44:05.960 align:start position:0%
with these issues is for fewer children
 
00:44:07.710 --> 00:44:07.720 align:start position:0%
to be removed from their
 
00:44:11.670 --> 00:44:11.680 align:start position:0%
homes and so fewer children either
 
00:44:13.750 --> 00:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
institutionalized or in foster care and
 
00:44:15.950 --> 00:44:15.960 align:start position:0%
that's for whole bunches of reasons none
 
00:44:20.790 --> 00:44:20.800 align:start position:0%
of which I'm an expert on uh but
 
00:44:23.190 --> 00:44:23.200 align:start position:0%
um a
 
00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:27.720 align:start position:0%
parent has has that right and and there
 
00:44:29.549 --> 00:44:29.559 align:start position:0%
there are times when you can speed a
 
00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:32.200 align:start position:0%
case up because it's really stagnating
 
00:44:35.829 --> 00:44:35.839 align:start position:0%
because the child deserves a safe home
 
00:44:37.710 --> 00:44:37.720 align:start position:0%
and there are times when you slow it
 
00:44:40.790 --> 00:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
down because typically the reason they
 
00:44:43.430 --> 00:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
get slowed down is a parent is in
 
00:44:45.390 --> 00:44:45.400 align:start position:0%
treatment for substance abuse they are
 
00:44:47.270 --> 00:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
making good progress they are going to
 
00:44:49.430 --> 00:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
their meetings they are submitting to
 
00:44:53.190 --> 00:44:53.200 align:start position:0%
drug screening they are working hard and
 
00:44:56.630 --> 00:44:56.640 align:start position:0%
their sobriety is still fragile enough
 
00:44:58.790 --> 00:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
that being being a full-time
 
00:45:00.870 --> 00:45:00.880 align:start position:0%
unsupervised parent with all of the
 
00:45:02.549 --> 00:45:02.559 align:start position:0%
stress that that brings is not they're
 
00:45:05.910 --> 00:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
not ready yet but it's recognized by
 
00:45:08.069 --> 00:45:08.079 align:start position:0%
everybody that they're progressing
 
00:45:12.349 --> 00:45:12.359 align:start position:0%
towards so it's sort of a onee but as in
 
00:45:14.670 --> 00:45:14.680 align:start position:0%
everything with this one size never fits
 
00:45:17.309 --> 00:45:17.319 align:start position:0%
all so U thank you and so one of the
 
00:45:18.750 --> 00:45:18.760 align:start position:0%
things that I want us to research I'll
 
00:45:22.349 --> 00:45:22.359 align:start position:0%
get to representative love next is um as
 
00:45:23.670 --> 00:45:23.680 align:start position:0%
I was reading some of these it seems
 
00:45:25.230 --> 00:45:25.240 align:start position:0%
that some of the federal funding is tied
 
00:45:27.109 --> 00:45:27.119 align:start position:0%
to the amount of time until the child is
 
00:45:29.069 --> 00:45:29.079 align:start position:0%
removed from the home and that if this
 
00:45:30.630 --> 00:45:30.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen on a certain timeline
 
00:45:33.829 --> 00:45:33.839 align:start position:0%
it's implicated um so I'd like to find
 
00:45:35.510 --> 00:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
out this this was in some of the
 
00:45:36.950 --> 00:45:36.960 align:start position:0%
reporting from some of some of the other
 
00:45:38.990 --> 00:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
states if we prove that that's not the
 
00:45:40.670 --> 00:45:40.680 align:start position:0%
case here then great we have more
 
00:45:45.030 --> 00:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
information however under the um it was
 
00:45:46.390 --> 00:45:46.400 align:start position:0%
stated that it was under the adoption
 
00:45:49.670 --> 00:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
and safe families act um so you know
 
00:45:50.990 --> 00:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
either we either we show what the
 
00:45:52.470 --> 00:45:52.480 align:start position:0%
numbers are or we show that it's not a
 
00:45:53.870 --> 00:45:53.880 align:start position:0%
concern either way it would be good to
 
00:45:55.589 --> 00:45:55.599 align:start position:0%
have that information well I think I
 
00:45:57.630 --> 00:45:57.640 align:start position:0%
think that that that is specifically
 
00:45:59.589 --> 00:45:59.599 align:start position:0%
what I was referring
 
00:46:03.190 --> 00:46:03.200 align:start position:0%
to what the federal legislation the goal
 
00:46:06.030 --> 00:46:06.040 align:start position:0%
of the federal legislation is ensuring
 
00:46:09.790 --> 00:46:09.800 align:start position:0%
that a child is not stuck in limbo
 
00:46:11.710 --> 00:46:11.720 align:start position:0%
forever because we are balancing the
 
00:46:13.190 --> 00:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
fundamental rights of the parent and the
 
00:46:17.030 --> 00:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
fundamental rights of the child and um
 
00:46:20.230 --> 00:46:20.240 align:start position:0%
so the goal of the federal legislation
 
00:46:23.910 --> 00:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
is to ensure that in the cases where
 
00:46:27.190 --> 00:46:27.200 align:start position:0%
parents are not making progress and the
 
00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
child is already out of the home that
 
00:46:31.670 --> 00:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
the child starts to progress towards
 
00:46:35.790 --> 00:46:35.800 align:start position:0%
adoption at the end of a year um it if
 
00:46:38.430 --> 00:46:38.440 align:start position:0%
if the child is in the home I think that
 
00:46:40.750 --> 00:46:40.760 align:start position:0%
we're really just looking at a different
 
00:46:42.670 --> 00:46:42.680 align:start position:0%
scenario thank you and I think we can
 
00:46:44.750 --> 00:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
probably all agree that if the intention
 
00:46:46.710 --> 00:46:46.720 align:start position:0%
of our bills were what actually happened
 
00:46:48.349 --> 00:46:48.359 align:start position:0%
we'd have a lot less legislation we'd
 
00:46:50.109 --> 00:46:50.119 align:start position:0%
have to do so we do want to make sure
 
00:46:52.109 --> 00:46:52.119 align:start position:0%
that those any financial implications
 
00:46:54.030 --> 00:46:54.040 align:start position:0%
are not leading to a different
 
00:46:55.750 --> 00:46:55.760 align:start position:0%
implementation that was intended
 
00:46:57.829 --> 00:46:57.839 align:start position:0%
representative love yeah to to bring it
 
00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:00.160 align:start position:0%
back uh to what representative kofalt
 
00:47:01.950 --> 00:47:01.960 align:start position:0%
and representative Greg who talked about
 
00:47:05.230 --> 00:47:05.240 align:start position:0%
the the procedures that go on in in um
 
00:47:08.190 --> 00:47:08.200 align:start position:0%
in dcyf the latitude that they have uh
 
00:47:13.349 --> 00:47:13.359 align:start position:0%
is is just too too great um when uh for
 
00:47:15.430 --> 00:47:15.440 align:start position:0%
instance if I if I decided to go a
 
00:47:17.309 --> 00:47:17.319 align:start position:0%
little crazy and jump across the table
 
00:47:20.349 --> 00:47:20.359 align:start position:0%
and punch representative long it's a
 
00:47:24.109 --> 00:47:24.119 align:start position:0%
criminal criminal act but if he's if
 
00:47:25.750 --> 00:47:25.760 align:start position:0%
he's five years old in my home and I
 
00:47:29.510 --> 00:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
punch him it's a dcyf investigation they
 
00:47:30.630 --> 00:47:30.640 align:start position:0%
don't have the they don't have the
 
00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:31.910 align:start position:0%
don't have the they don't have the
investigative

00:47:31.910 --> 00:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
investigative
 
00:47:34.309 --> 00:47:34.319 align:start position:0%
skills that you know a detective would
 
00:47:37.109 --> 00:47:37.119 align:start position:0%
have uh that they come in and this is
 
00:47:39.510 --> 00:47:39.520 align:start position:0%
what I I get from from constituents you
 
00:47:41.510 --> 00:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
know that they come in and uh you know
 
00:47:45.030 --> 00:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
the the especially when most of them are
 
00:47:47.430 --> 00:47:47.440 align:start position:0%
are divorce cases going on but they'll
 
00:47:49.190 --> 00:47:49.200 align:start position:0%
they'll uh invest they'll question the
 
00:47:52.670 --> 00:47:52.680 align:start position:0%
child with the father and then they'll
 
00:47:55.390 --> 00:47:55.400 align:start position:0%
you know our father or mother whatever
 
00:47:56.829 --> 00:47:56.839 align:start position:0%
uh but then they'll then they'll
 
00:47:59.349 --> 00:47:59.359 align:start position:0%
question them again in front of the the
 
00:48:02.470 --> 00:48:02.480 align:start position:0%
the abuser and uh what 5-year-old child
 
00:48:04.670 --> 00:48:04.680 align:start position:0%
isn't going to cow it to that you know
 
00:48:06.270 --> 00:48:06.280 align:start position:0%
uh you know representative Greg
 
00:48:08.630 --> 00:48:08.640 align:start position:0%
mentioned the broken bones you know many
 
00:48:10.230 --> 00:48:10.240 align:start position:0%
times I've heard from constituents no
 
00:48:11.790 --> 00:48:11.800 align:start position:0%
broken bones no hospitalization there
 
00:48:14.030 --> 00:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
isn't much we can do that's a common
 
00:48:16.230 --> 00:48:16.240 align:start position:0%
common thing that they say and uh that's
 
00:48:18.309 --> 00:48:18.319 align:start position:0%
way too much latitude if a child has
 
00:48:20.470 --> 00:48:20.480 align:start position:0%
been punched it's a criminal thing and
 
00:48:23.670 --> 00:48:23.680 align:start position:0%
uh you know uh we've got to put we've
 
00:48:25.190 --> 00:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
we've got to make sure that that that
 
00:48:27.470 --> 00:48:27.480 align:start position:0%
that Latitude is really shrunk because
 
00:48:29.150 --> 00:48:29.160 align:start position:0%
uh it's it's a lot of where our problem
 
00:48:31.710 --> 00:48:31.720 align:start position:0%
is lied I mean poor Hy Montgomery you
 
00:48:33.470 --> 00:48:33.480 align:start position:0%
know sitting there in the backseat of a
 
00:48:35.069 --> 00:48:35.079 align:start position:0%
car in the middle of February with her
 
00:48:37.390 --> 00:48:37.400 align:start position:0%
with their two siblings you know and um
 
00:48:39.430 --> 00:48:39.440 align:start position:0%
you know Mom and Dad are s mom and uh
 
00:48:40.950 --> 00:48:40.960 align:start position:0%
stepmom and dad are sitting in the front
 
00:48:43.430 --> 00:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
car front seat of the car shooting dope
 
00:48:45.870 --> 00:48:45.880 align:start position:0%
where do we draw the line my God you
 
00:48:49.349 --> 00:48:49.359 align:start position:0%
know um you know this is this just and
 
00:48:50.990 --> 00:48:51.000 align:start position:0%
representative kofalt talked about you
 
00:48:53.430 --> 00:48:53.440 align:start position:0%
know it it could be a a lot has to do
 
00:48:55.230 --> 00:48:55.240 align:start position:0%
with you know there just the the workers
 
00:48:57.030 --> 00:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
overburdened that you know the got a
 
00:48:59.270 --> 00:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
stack of cases on the on their desk that
 
00:49:02.829 --> 00:49:02.839 align:start position:0%
high uh but uh we've got to find the
 
00:49:04.990 --> 00:49:05.000 align:start position:0%
find find the way to to uh to get this
 
00:49:07.349 --> 00:49:07.359 align:start position:0%
done right that is a great Point
 
00:49:09.589 --> 00:49:09.599 align:start position:0%
representative love um as I was looking
 
00:49:11.470 --> 00:49:11.480 align:start position:0%
through the criminal statutes assault of
 
00:49:13.390 --> 00:49:13.400 align:start position:0%
a child under 13 is treated more
 
00:49:16.630 --> 00:49:16.640 align:start position:0%
severely than assault of an adult um so
 
00:49:18.030 --> 00:49:18.040 align:start position:0%
one of the questions that then we would
 
00:49:21.710 --> 00:49:21.720 align:start position:0%
have is how is the decision made if um
 
00:49:24.150 --> 00:49:24.160 align:start position:0%
to either refer for criminal prosecution
 
00:49:26.309 --> 00:49:26.319 align:start position:0%
which I would say that that physical
 
00:49:28.109 --> 00:49:28.119 align:start position:0%
assault physical assault of a child
 
00:49:30.829 --> 00:49:30.839 align:start position:0%
should I would say should be criminal um
 
00:49:32.870 --> 00:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
and when it's decided not to not to be
 
00:49:34.430 --> 00:49:34.440 align:start position:0%
pursued that way and to be pursued under
 
00:49:37.150 --> 00:49:37.160 align:start position:0%
DCF so I'd like to know what what those
 
00:49:39.349 --> 00:49:39.359 align:start position:0%
lines are and what those processes are
 
00:49:41.069 --> 00:49:41.079 align:start position:0%
and if it's something where perhaps we
 
00:49:42.390 --> 00:49:42.400 align:start position:0%
need to have more resources to the
 
00:49:43.990 --> 00:49:44.000 align:start position:0%
prosecutors in order to deal with these
 
00:49:45.950 --> 00:49:45.960 align:start position:0%
cases because if they're just worried
 
00:49:47.630 --> 00:49:47.640 align:start position:0%
about a low referral rate and a low
 
00:49:50.150 --> 00:49:50.160 align:start position:0%
uptake rate then we we have the power to
 
00:49:52.109 --> 00:49:52.119 align:start position:0%
work with others to fix that U
 
00:49:53.030 --> 00:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
representative Weber and then
 
00:49:55.589 --> 00:49:55.599 align:start position:0%
representative Greg and I think you're
 
00:49:57.510 --> 00:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
right about all of that but I think that
 
00:50:00.270 --> 00:50:00.280 align:start position:0%
the um it it it's important to remember
 
00:50:02.670 --> 00:50:02.680 align:start position:0%
it's not an either or the two things may
 
00:50:04.670 --> 00:50:04.680 align:start position:0%
be happening at the same time that's
 
00:50:07.069 --> 00:50:07.079 align:start position:0%
that's number one and number two the
 
00:50:09.109 --> 00:50:09.119 align:start position:0%
problem with the criminal prosecution is
 
00:50:11.870 --> 00:50:11.880 align:start position:0%
you have to have as as representative
 
00:50:14.150 --> 00:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
Panic said you have to have evidence you
 
00:50:17.470 --> 00:50:17.480 align:start position:0%
have to have evidence in a in a DCF case
 
00:50:22.270 --> 00:50:22.280 align:start position:0%
as well uh but if if you have a child
 
00:50:24.910 --> 00:50:24.920 align:start position:0%
with a bruise and somebody says so and
 
00:50:27.829 --> 00:50:27.839 align:start position:0%
so punch the child and and so and so
 
00:50:30.430 --> 00:50:30.440 align:start position:0%
saying no I didn't you have to be able
 
00:50:34.670 --> 00:50:34.680 align:start position:0%
to prove what happened and and that may
 
00:50:37.510 --> 00:50:37.520 align:start position:0%
have an impact on the low rates of
 
00:50:39.430 --> 00:50:39.440 align:start position:0%
criminal prosecution but I think that
 
00:50:42.430 --> 00:50:42.440 align:start position:0%
it's definitely an area for
 
00:50:44.549 --> 00:50:44.559 align:start position:0%
exploration representative
 
00:50:46.829 --> 00:50:46.839 align:start position:0%
Greg thank you madam chairman I think
 
00:50:48.549 --> 00:50:48.559 align:start position:0%
another part that you know we talk a lot
 
00:50:50.190 --> 00:50:50.200 align:start position:0%
about the physical injuries and the
 
00:50:52.270 --> 00:50:52.280 align:start position:0%
broken bones and stuff but one of uh
 
00:50:55.829 --> 00:50:55.839 align:start position:0%
dcf's uh biggest challenges and one of
 
00:50:57.430 --> 00:50:57.440 align:start position:0%
uh the things that they have to look at
 
00:50:59.910 --> 00:50:59.920 align:start position:0%
is also the environment the child's in
 
00:51:01.950 --> 00:51:01.960 align:start position:0%
because abuse things aren't always like
 
00:51:04.030 --> 00:51:04.040 align:start position:0%
well he got hit or whatever it could be
 
00:51:05.910 --> 00:51:05.920 align:start position:0%
you know the psychological Terror from
 
00:51:09.230 --> 00:51:09.240 align:start position:0%
maybe um you know Mom was strangling dad
 
00:51:10.789 --> 00:51:10.799 align:start position:0%
and the child was witnessed to that
 
00:51:12.230 --> 00:51:12.240 align:start position:0%
there are different there are different
 
00:51:15.309 --> 00:51:15.319 align:start position:0%
levels even within that or um you know
 
00:51:18.069 --> 00:51:18.079 align:start position:0%
maybe they're
 
00:51:20.750 --> 00:51:20.760 align:start position:0%
um allowed to play with a real gun
 
00:51:22.109 --> 00:51:22.119 align:start position:0%
instead of a a play gun you know there
 
00:51:24.230 --> 00:51:24.240 align:start position:0%
are different levels that dcyf has to
 
00:51:26.589 --> 00:51:26.599 align:start position:0%
look at and so not all of those that
 
00:51:28.390 --> 00:51:28.400 align:start position:0%
goes back to that switch thing not all
 
00:51:30.390 --> 00:51:30.400 align:start position:0%
of these are criminal so there's this
 
00:51:32.470 --> 00:51:32.480 align:start position:0%
you know waving when dcyf as soon as
 
00:51:34.150 --> 00:51:34.160 align:start position:0%
they see that it is a criminal thing
 
00:51:36.829 --> 00:51:36.839 align:start position:0%
such as assault that's when it goes to
 
00:51:38.390 --> 00:51:38.400 align:start position:0%
you know the police and the police can
 
00:51:40.670 --> 00:51:40.680 align:start position:0%
do their investigations and stuff but
 
00:51:42.750 --> 00:51:42.760 align:start position:0%
first there are so many other things
 
00:51:45.270 --> 00:51:45.280 align:start position:0%
that dcyf has to look at whether it's
 
00:51:47.910 --> 00:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
you know doing drugs in front of kids um
 
00:51:51.190 --> 00:51:51.200 align:start position:0%
you know uh not feeding them you know
 
00:51:54.630 --> 00:51:54.640 align:start position:0%
for for a a time period or you know
 
00:51:56.589 --> 00:51:56.599 align:start position:0%
restricting them to a cage even you know
 
00:51:57.829 --> 00:51:57.839 align:start position:0%
there are so many other things that
 
00:51:59.270 --> 00:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
they're looking at that isn't
 
00:52:01.789 --> 00:52:01.799 align:start position:0%
necessarily a physical thing so it's a
 
00:52:03.950 --> 00:52:03.960 align:start position:0%
very complicated spectrum of things I
 
00:52:05.390 --> 00:52:05.400 align:start position:0%
think it'll be great to actually get
 
00:52:08.270 --> 00:52:08.280 align:start position:0%
them in here and hear firsthand the kind
 
00:52:10.190 --> 00:52:10.200 align:start position:0%
of things in New Hampshire that they're
 
00:52:11.750 --> 00:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
looking at because the things that we
 
00:52:13.549 --> 00:52:13.559 align:start position:0%
think are just on the news and other
 
00:52:15.630 --> 00:52:15.640 align:start position:0%
places they're absolutely in our
 
00:52:18.069 --> 00:52:18.079 align:start position:0%
backyard um thank you and if putting a
 
00:52:20.549 --> 00:52:20.559 align:start position:0%
child in a cage is not already criminal
 
00:52:22.230 --> 00:52:22.240 align:start position:0%
statute let's work together and make it
 
00:52:25.030 --> 00:52:25.040 align:start position:0%
so that that is for false imprisonment
 
00:52:27.309 --> 00:52:27.319 align:start position:0%
um and I know it's quite possible that
 
00:52:28.870 --> 00:52:28.880 align:start position:0%
it is U so with that I would like to
 
00:52:30.910 --> 00:52:30.920 align:start position:0%
know what the referral rate is and then
 
00:52:33.270 --> 00:52:33.280 align:start position:0%
what the actual rate of um it BR
 
00:52:35.150 --> 00:52:35.160 align:start position:0%
prosecuted and then sort of what the
 
00:52:36.710 --> 00:52:36.720 align:start position:0%
outcomes are for that because if we
 
00:52:38.069 --> 00:52:38.079 align:start position:0%
don't have enough resources in our
 
00:52:39.870 --> 00:52:39.880 align:start position:0%
criminal system and we're allowing
 
00:52:39.880 --> 00:52:40.710 align:start position:0%
criminal system and we're allowing
people

00:52:40.710 --> 00:52:40.720 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:52:43.589 --> 00:52:43.599 align:start position:0%
to commit physical crimes against kids
 
00:52:44.990 --> 00:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
that's a big problem and one we should
 
00:52:48.950 --> 00:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
solve um representative Weber I'll just
 
00:52:52.030 --> 00:52:52.040 align:start position:0%
add that you know historically I mean
 
00:52:54.270 --> 00:52:54.280 align:start position:0%
one of the things that's that's
 
00:52:55.670 --> 00:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
difficult about this is It's a moving
 
00:52:57.870 --> 00:52:57.880 align:start position:0%
Target now I think things have been
 
00:52:59.750 --> 00:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
moving in the right direction but
 
00:53:03.349 --> 00:53:03.359 align:start position:0%
historically I mean I can remember it's
 
00:53:05.589 --> 00:53:05.599 align:start position:0%
it's only been within the last 8 to 10
 
00:53:10.150 --> 00:53:10.160 align:start position:0%
years for example that having drug
 
00:53:13.430 --> 00:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
paraphernalia all over the house was
 
00:53:17.150 --> 00:53:17.160 align:start position:0%
allowed to be considered as a factor in
 
00:53:19.470 --> 00:53:19.480 align:start position:0%
abuse and neglect prior to that the
 
00:53:21.510 --> 00:53:21.520 align:start position:0%
child actually had to either ingest
 
00:53:23.430 --> 00:53:23.440 align:start position:0%
something or stick themselves with
 
00:53:27.309 --> 00:53:27.319 align:start position:0%
something before that was allowable and
 
00:53:29.990 --> 00:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
it seems axiomatic to me that we
 
00:53:32.030 --> 00:53:32.040 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have to wait until the child
 
00:53:37.190 --> 00:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
is actually injured uh but as
 
00:53:40.190 --> 00:53:40.200 align:start position:0%
recently as about 10 years ago that
 
00:53:43.349 --> 00:53:43.359 align:start position:0%
wasn't even a consideration so uh it's
 
00:53:45.750 --> 00:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
it's important to recognize the rate of
 
00:53:47.630 --> 00:53:47.640 align:start position:0%
change the other thing that has been
 
00:53:50.710 --> 00:53:50.720 align:start position:0%
interesting to me historically is that
 
00:53:52.309 --> 00:53:52.319 align:start position:0%
eight or 10 years ago we fought and
 
00:53:53.990 --> 00:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
fought and fought to get more positions
 
00:53:57.950 --> 00:53:57.960 align:start position:0%
with DCF because the um case workers
 
00:54:00.870 --> 00:54:00.880 align:start position:0%
were carrying rate case loads that were
 
00:54:04.069 --> 00:54:04.079 align:start position:0%
five or six times the best practices
 
00:54:07.309 --> 00:54:07.319 align:start position:0%
average now we have those positions and
 
00:54:10.109 --> 00:54:10.119 align:start position:0%
the challenges finding people to
 
00:54:13.230 --> 00:54:13.240 align:start position:0%
actually fill the existing positions so
 
00:54:15.549 --> 00:54:15.559 align:start position:0%
in some ways we're back in that same
 
00:54:18.910 --> 00:54:18.920 align:start position:0%
bind we were talking about the issue of
 
00:54:21.829 --> 00:54:21.839 align:start position:0%
uh needing to have enough workers to to
 
00:54:24.270 --> 00:54:24.280 align:start position:0%
deal with the workload so we're we're
 
00:54:25.750 --> 00:54:25.760 align:start position:0%
back in the same position but it's from
 
00:54:26.870 --> 00:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
a different
 
00:54:28.430 --> 00:54:28.440 align:start position:0%
a different
 
00:54:30.510 --> 00:54:30.520 align:start position:0%
reason thank you those are definitely
 
00:54:33.510 --> 00:54:33.520 align:start position:0%
good points um so representative oh did
 
00:54:34.990 --> 00:54:35.000 align:start position:0%
you have something repres yes I just
 
00:54:37.270 --> 00:54:37.280 align:start position:0%
want to address one thing to uh Vice
 
00:54:40.030 --> 00:54:40.040 align:start position:0%
chair we just SP uh spent some time on
 
00:54:42.349 --> 00:54:42.359 align:start position:0%
children and family law committee and we
 
00:54:46.230 --> 00:54:46.240 align:start position:0%
just passed unanimously in our committee
 
00:54:48.549 --> 00:54:48.559 align:start position:0%
um to expand
 
00:54:48.559 --> 00:54:50.069 align:start position:0%
um to expand
dcf's

00:54:50.069 --> 00:54:50.079 align:start position:0%
dcf's
 
00:54:53.390 --> 00:54:53.400 align:start position:0%
ability um for personnel so it's going
 
00:54:57.710 --> 00:54:57.720 align:start position:0%
into Finance so we are looking at that
 
00:54:59.829 --> 00:54:59.839 align:start position:0%
but we've got to put some rins on it too
 
00:55:03.670 --> 00:55:03.680 align:start position:0%
which we did it's always a moving T
 
00:55:06.750 --> 00:55:06.760 align:start position:0%
right thank you for your work on that um
 
00:55:09.670 --> 00:55:09.680 align:start position:0%
thank you and and then my other question
 
00:55:11.910 --> 00:55:11.920 align:start position:0%
becomes at what point does compliance
 
00:55:15.270 --> 00:55:15.280 align:start position:0%
with DCF process when it's not criminal
 
00:55:17.990 --> 00:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
stop being voluntary because it seems
 
00:55:20.030 --> 00:55:20.040 align:start position:0%
that cooperating with them at all in the
 
00:55:22.270 --> 00:55:22.280 align:start position:0%
first place is voluntary when does that
 
00:55:25.670 --> 00:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
move from voluntary to compelled with a
 
00:55:28.829 --> 00:55:28.839 align:start position:0%
consequence if they do not follow
 
00:55:31.670 --> 00:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
through representative Weber well if I'm
 
00:55:33.150 --> 00:55:33.160 align:start position:0%
understanding your
 
00:55:36.910 --> 00:55:36.920 align:start position:0%
question um and I was thinking about
 
00:55:39.510 --> 00:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
this in context of something you raised
 
00:55:41.829 --> 00:55:41.839 align:start position:0%
earlier in another meeting about drug
 
00:55:41.839 --> 00:55:46.430 align:start position:0%
earlier in another meeting about drug
testing

00:55:46.430 --> 00:55:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:50.270 --> 00:55:50.280 align:start position:0%
um basically everything a parent does
 
00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:56.829 --> 00:55:56.839 align:start position:0%
DCF um
 
00:56:00.230 --> 00:56:00.240 align:start position:0%
well it's it's it's how you look at
 
00:56:03.109 --> 00:56:03.119 align:start position:0%
voluntary and I realize there are very
 
00:56:04.670 --> 00:56:04.680 align:start position:0%
different shades of voluntary and
 
00:56:06.990 --> 00:56:07.000 align:start position:0%
they're ve very different shades of
 
00:56:10.230 --> 00:56:10.240 align:start position:0%
coercion if for example somebody is
 
00:56:12.510 --> 00:56:12.520 align:start position:0%
undergoing a drug test as a part of a
 
00:56:12.520 --> 00:56:13.589 align:start position:0%
undergoing a drug test as a part of a
drug

00:56:13.589 --> 00:56:13.599 align:start position:0%
drug
 
00:56:17.109 --> 00:56:17.119 align:start position:0%
court uh they either take the test or
 
00:56:20.510 --> 00:56:20.520 align:start position:0%
they go to jail it's very simple uh
 
00:56:22.390 --> 00:56:22.400 align:start position:0%
because they were either because they
 
00:56:24.549 --> 00:56:24.559 align:start position:0%
were adjudicated or because they agreed
 
00:56:27.109 --> 00:56:27.119 align:start position:0%
to that as part of their Criminal
 
00:56:30.990 --> 00:56:31.000 align:start position:0%
sentence in DCF
 
00:56:34.510 --> 00:56:34.520 align:start position:0%
cases um
 
00:56:38.990 --> 00:56:39.000 align:start position:0%
the a parent is not compelled to do a
 
00:56:42.670 --> 00:56:42.680 align:start position:0%
drug test for example but I think
 
00:56:44.309 --> 00:56:44.319 align:start position:0%
there's a great deal of room for
 
00:56:47.309 --> 00:56:47.319 align:start position:0%
discussion of how coercive it is when
 
00:56:50.670 --> 00:56:50.680 align:start position:0%
you say to somebody this is to to
 
00:56:53.349 --> 00:56:53.359 align:start position:0%
representative kof's point this is what
 
00:56:55.589 --> 00:56:55.599 align:start position:0%
you have to do or you're not going to
 
00:56:57.990 --> 00:56:58.000 align:start position:0%
get your children back or this is what
 
00:57:00.150 --> 00:57:00.160 align:start position:0%
you have to do and or you're going to
 
00:57:02.150 --> 00:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
have your children taken away there's a
 
00:57:05.349 --> 00:57:05.359 align:start position:0%
great deal of coercion there
 
00:57:09.309 --> 00:57:09.319 align:start position:0%
but that's what the consequence is um
 
00:57:11.069 --> 00:57:11.079 align:start position:0%
you you come up with the plan in the
 
00:57:13.029 --> 00:57:13.039 align:start position:0%
dispositive hearing and the parent
 
00:57:17.670 --> 00:57:17.680 align:start position:0%
either voluntarily follows the plan in
 
00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:18.990 align:start position:0%
either voluntarily follows the plan in
which

00:57:18.990 --> 00:57:19.000 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:57:22.069 --> 00:57:22.079 align:start position:0%
case they're working towards disengaging
 
00:57:24.630 --> 00:57:24.640 align:start position:0%
with dcyf and and you know you I have a
 
00:57:25.910 --> 00:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
final hearing where the judge says
 
00:57:30.750 --> 00:57:30.760 align:start position:0%
you're doing a great job thank you um or
 
00:57:34.150 --> 00:57:34.160 align:start position:0%
or you proceed with some other
 
00:57:34.160 --> 00:57:36.270 align:start position:0%
or you proceed with some other
proceeding

00:57:36.270 --> 00:57:36.280 align:start position:0%
proceeding
 
00:57:36.280 --> 00:57:37.950 align:start position:0%
proceeding
but

00:57:37.950 --> 00:57:37.960 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:57:40.910 --> 00:57:40.920 align:start position:0%
so in that context things are voluntary
 
00:57:42.829 --> 00:57:42.839 align:start position:0%
but in that context there is also
 
00:57:45.589 --> 00:57:45.599 align:start position:0%
coercion involved
 
00:57:45.599 --> 00:57:47.549 align:start position:0%
coercion involved
so

00:57:47.549 --> 00:57:47.559 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:57:50.589 --> 00:57:50.599 align:start position:0%
um it's not something
 
00:57:54.430 --> 00:57:54.440 align:start position:0%
that has an easy answer thank you
 
00:57:57.309 --> 00:57:57.319 align:start position:0%
representative long thank you m chair so
 
00:57:59.670 --> 00:57:59.680 align:start position:0%
uh when uh representative Weber
 
00:58:02.789 --> 00:58:02.799 align:start position:0%
discussed the uh procedures dcy
 
00:58:04.349 --> 00:58:04.359 align:start position:0%
procedures I would think that at the
 
00:58:06.990 --> 00:58:07.000 align:start position:0%
dispositional hearing where both parties
 
00:58:09.630 --> 00:58:09.640 align:start position:0%
present evidence that's when it wouldn't
 
00:58:12.150 --> 00:58:12.160 align:start position:0%
be voluntary if you want to defend
 
00:58:14.430 --> 00:58:14.440 align:start position:0%
yourself you have to present your
 
00:58:17.150 --> 00:58:17.160 align:start position:0%
evidence um so that I think at that
 
00:58:22.589 --> 00:58:22.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:24.710 --> 00:58:24.720 align:start position:0%
voluntar uh thank you so it' be
 
00:58:26.829 --> 00:58:26.839 align:start position:0%
voluntarily up to then
 
00:58:29.470 --> 00:58:29.480 align:start position:0%
it can be okay and so within that
 
00:58:31.349 --> 00:58:31.359 align:start position:0%
process that if it's voluntary through
 
00:58:33.190 --> 00:58:33.200 align:start position:0%
then there's no way to remove the child
 
00:58:36.510 --> 00:58:36.520 align:start position:0%
until You' reach the dispositional
 
00:58:40.670 --> 00:58:40.680 align:start position:0%
hearing child can be removed exp parte
 
00:58:43.109 --> 00:58:43.119 align:start position:0%
so without court hearing if there's an
 
00:58:45.589 --> 00:58:45.599 align:start position:0%
immediate danger a court can be removed
 
00:58:47.549 --> 00:58:47.559 align:start position:0%
at the preliminary hearing a court can
 
00:58:50.670 --> 00:58:50.680 align:start position:0%
be removed at the adjudicatory hearing
 
00:58:52.870 --> 00:58:52.880 align:start position:0%
and the child can be removed If the
 
00:58:55.710 --> 00:58:55.720 align:start position:0%
child was left with the parent the the
 
00:58:58.109 --> 00:58:58.119 align:start position:0%
child can always be removed if if it
 
00:58:59.710 --> 00:58:59.720 align:start position:0%
turns out that that was not a safe
 
00:59:03.109 --> 00:59:03.119 align:start position:0%
placement that happen that can happen
 
00:59:06.349 --> 00:59:06.359 align:start position:0%
anywhere along the
 
00:59:08.990 --> 00:59:09.000 align:start position:0%
line but that's a question of immed
 
00:59:10.589 --> 00:59:10.599 align:start position:0%
safety of the
 
00:59:13.430 --> 00:59:13.440 align:start position:0%
child okay thank you and that's not a
 
00:59:16.510 --> 00:59:16.520 align:start position:0%
criminal statute right and none of this
 
00:59:18.309 --> 00:59:18.319 align:start position:0%
is criminal in nature so but you're
 
00:59:21.789 --> 00:59:21.799 align:start position:0%
removing a child which is one of which
 
00:59:24.430 --> 00:59:24.440 align:start position:0%
is a significant liberty interest right
 
00:59:26.670 --> 00:59:26.680 align:start position:0%
so within this in both directions in
 
00:59:29.549 --> 00:59:29.559 align:start position:0%
both directions yes but you have this
 
00:59:32.309 --> 00:59:32.319 align:start position:0%
process and it seems that the what I'm
 
00:59:34.430 --> 00:59:34.440 align:start position:0%
seeing most of the protections of due
 
00:59:35.750 --> 00:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
process are the fact that you don't have
 
00:59:37.870 --> 00:59:37.880 align:start position:0%
to comply except if you don't comply
 
00:59:39.750 --> 00:59:39.760 align:start position:0%
your child is taken I'm trying to
 
00:59:44.190 --> 00:59:44.200 align:start position:0%
understand this no well my classical
 
00:59:46.029 --> 00:59:46.039 align:start position:0%
understanding of due process is here's
 
00:59:48.630 --> 00:59:48.640 align:start position:0%
what the process is first of all
 
00:59:50.910 --> 00:59:50.920 align:start position:0%
somebody has to file an
 
00:59:54.510 --> 00:59:54.520 align:start position:0%
affidavit uh secondly the court does a
 
00:59:58.589 --> 00:59:58.599 align:start position:0%
preliminary review and the court so that
 
01:00:02.750 --> 01:00:02.760 align:start position:0%
is a component of due process you have
 
01:00:05.710 --> 01:00:05.720 align:start position:0%
an independent review by an independent
 
01:00:10.150 --> 01:00:10.160 align:start position:0%
magistrate of what is presented to the
 
01:00:13.309 --> 01:00:13.319 align:start position:0%
magistrate and the parent can if they
 
01:00:16.789 --> 01:00:16.799 align:start position:0%
wish present or doesn't have
 
01:00:20.630 --> 01:00:20.640 align:start position:0%
to then you get the second point which
 
01:00:23.270 --> 01:00:23.280 align:start position:0%
is the adjudicatory hearing which
 
01:00:28.630 --> 01:00:28.640 align:start position:0%
again the burden of proof is all on DCF
 
01:00:31.910 --> 01:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
to prove that there was abuse or neglect
 
01:00:34.910 --> 01:00:34.920 align:start position:0%
or the case is dismissed so that is due
 
01:00:37.829 --> 01:00:37.839 align:start position:0%
process part of the due process is that
 
01:00:41.510 --> 01:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
the parent has the right to an attorney
 
01:00:44.950 --> 01:00:44.960 align:start position:0%
so they are given counsel as well as the
 
01:00:47.069 --> 01:00:47.079 align:start position:0%
two hearings and then when you get to
 
01:00:51.069 --> 01:00:51.079 align:start position:0%
the third hearing about we we have an
 
01:00:55.069 --> 01:00:55.079 align:start position:0%
adjudication then the next question is
 
01:00:58.630 --> 01:00:58.640 align:start position:0%
um what what is the plan going
 
01:01:02.470 --> 01:01:02.480 align:start position:0%
forward so thank you so I guess within
 
01:01:06.230 --> 01:01:06.240 align:start position:0%
that the probably Key Stone of this is
 
01:01:08.150 --> 01:01:08.160 align:start position:0%
that it's an independent review Court
 
01:01:10.549 --> 01:01:10.559 align:start position:0%
review of the affidavit the independence
 
01:01:13.150 --> 01:01:13.160 align:start position:0%
of those two bodies AB absolutely okay
 
01:01:15.470 --> 01:01:15.480 align:start position:0%
um and so with that I'd like to and as
 
01:01:17.270 --> 01:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
you said the independent nature of the C
 
01:01:19.069 --> 01:01:19.079 align:start position:0%
quality of the council provided if it's
 
01:01:21.069 --> 01:01:21.079 align:start position:0%
not of the parents choosing okay so I
 
01:01:22.750 --> 01:01:22.760 align:start position:0%
think that's actually going to be a very
 
01:01:24.349 --> 01:01:24.359 align:start position:0%
important thing for us to dig into as
 
01:01:25.670 --> 01:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
well the independence of all of these
 
01:01:29.870 --> 01:01:29.880 align:start position:0%
different sections um but I I I guess
 
01:01:32.150 --> 01:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
now that we're representative
 
01:01:34.910 --> 01:01:34.920 align:start position:0%
Cal yeah again I'm going to I'm going to
 
01:01:37.029 --> 01:01:37.039 align:start position:0%
offer what is sort of anecdotal
 
01:01:39.789 --> 01:01:39.799 align:start position:0%
information but I think it merits
 
01:01:42.630 --> 01:01:42.640 align:start position:0%
further investigation which is you know
 
01:01:45.510 --> 01:01:45.520 align:start position:0%
among the due process rights listed in
 
01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
one of the documents you shared is the
 
01:01:51.670 --> 01:01:51.680 align:start position:0%
right to be heard and we have heard this
 
01:01:54.269 --> 01:01:54.279 align:start position:0%
somewhat repeated in in other forms
 
01:01:56.150 --> 01:01:56.160 align:start position:0%
throughout this discussion which is is
 
01:01:59.910 --> 01:01:59.920 align:start position:0%
that a a parent who has been accused has
 
01:02:01.269 --> 01:02:01.279 align:start position:0%
a right
 
01:02:04.349 --> 01:02:04.359 align:start position:0%
to present evidence a right to be heard
 
01:02:08.309 --> 01:02:08.319 align:start position:0%
in court um so the anecdotal information
 
01:02:12.430 --> 01:02:12.440 align:start position:0%
is that I have heard from at least two
 
01:02:14.990 --> 01:02:15.000 align:start position:0%
people who have said that they did not
 
01:02:17.589 --> 01:02:17.599 align:start position:0%
have an opportunity to present the
 
01:02:19.870 --> 01:02:19.880 align:start position:0%
evidence that they had prepared and the
 
01:02:21.470 --> 01:02:21.480 align:start position:0%
expert witnesses that they had brought
 
01:02:24.750 --> 01:02:24.760 align:start position:0%
with them to court that's a concern that
 
01:02:27.109 --> 01:02:27.119 align:start position:0%
to me is a is a violation of due process
 
01:02:29.589 --> 01:02:29.599 align:start position:0%
and I know that we have said that we
 
01:02:32.589 --> 01:02:32.599 align:start position:0%
don't want to um you know we need to
 
01:02:37.430 --> 01:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
focus on DCF not the courts I agree and
 
01:02:40.390 --> 01:02:40.400 align:start position:0%
yet um there is an end to-end process
 
01:02:43.470 --> 01:02:43.480 align:start position:0%
here and we need to consider the
 
01:02:48.069 --> 01:02:48.079 align:start position:0%
implications on due process um for for
 
01:02:49.309 --> 01:02:49.319 align:start position:0%
the person who's going through this
 
01:02:52.470 --> 01:02:52.480 align:start position:0%
experience and and not just say well um
 
01:02:53.789 --> 01:02:53.799 align:start position:0%
you know we'll throw it over to the
 
01:02:55.029 --> 01:02:55.039 align:start position:0%
other side of the wall and then it's the
 
01:02:57.870 --> 01:02:57.880 align:start position:0%
court it's it's the courts issue um we
 
01:03:00.309 --> 01:03:00.319 align:start position:0%
we need to I mean our our job is to
 
01:03:04.349 --> 01:03:04.359 align:start position:0%
understand um if there are um breakdowns
 
01:03:06.910 --> 01:03:06.920 align:start position:0%
in due process where are they and what
 
01:03:09.269 --> 01:03:09.279 align:start position:0%
would this committee recommend to remedy
 
01:03:12.349 --> 01:03:12.359 align:start position:0%
those thank you representative Greg um
 
01:03:14.069 --> 01:03:14.079 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairwoman so I also sit
 
01:03:16.190 --> 01:03:16.200 align:start position:0%
on the special com uh committee looking
 
01:03:17.589 --> 01:03:17.599 align:start position:0%
at the family courts we've actually
 
01:03:20.190 --> 01:03:20.200 align:start position:0%
addressed that specifically um somebody
 
01:03:23.589 --> 01:03:23.599 align:start position:0%
not being able to uh give you know
 
01:03:25.910 --> 01:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
everything that they think and and and
 
01:03:28.230 --> 01:03:28.240 align:start position:0%
why so we had a bill at least having the
 
01:03:31.870 --> 01:03:31.880 align:start position:0%
judges kind of like explain um but
 
01:03:33.230 --> 01:03:33.240 align:start position:0%
that's something that the special
 
01:03:34.990 --> 01:03:35.000 align:start position:0%
committee on family courts I I do
 
01:03:37.069 --> 01:03:37.079 align:start position:0%
believe that that's where that belongs
 
01:03:38.789 --> 01:03:38.799 align:start position:0%
and we've kind of addressed that so
 
01:03:40.109 --> 01:03:40.119 align:start position:0%
those are pretty complicated but just
 
01:03:42.150 --> 01:03:42.160 align:start position:0%
wanted to let you know that um thank you
 
01:03:43.630 --> 01:03:43.640 align:start position:0%
do you know the status of that because
 
01:03:45.069 --> 01:03:45.079 align:start position:0%
as a bill it'll be going over to the
 
01:03:47.029 --> 01:03:47.039 align:start position:0%
Senate and we need to make sure we can't
 
01:03:48.510 --> 01:03:48.520 align:start position:0%
check it off the list until it becomes
 
01:03:50.510 --> 01:03:50.520 align:start position:0%
lost I do not know I know that there's
 
01:03:52.269 --> 01:03:52.279 align:start position:0%
there's some ongoing issues with that
 
01:03:54.670 --> 01:03:54.680 align:start position:0%
one that we're kind of um looking into
 
01:03:58.829 --> 01:03:58.839 align:start position:0%
so I don't I think that I think it did
 
01:04:00.910 --> 01:04:00.920 align:start position:0%
pass through the house did it not yeah I
 
01:04:03.309 --> 01:04:03.319 align:start position:0%
thought it also yeah yeah I think it
 
01:04:05.990 --> 01:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
pass through the house and fin with the
 
01:04:07.870 --> 01:04:07.880 align:start position:0%
family court yeah so it'll be with that
 
01:04:09.349 --> 01:04:09.359 align:start position:0%
special committee but that's something
 
01:04:10.950 --> 01:04:10.960 align:start position:0%
specifically that we looked at because
 
01:04:13.309 --> 01:04:13.319 align:start position:0%
we did hear cases where people thought
 
01:04:15.150 --> 01:04:15.160 align:start position:0%
that they didn't get enough information
 
01:04:17.230 --> 01:04:17.240 align:start position:0%
and and and that's one of those cases
 
01:04:18.829 --> 01:04:18.839 align:start position:0%
where with each case it's very
 
01:04:21.190 --> 01:04:21.200 align:start position:0%
individual and that's the judicial
 
01:04:23.549 --> 01:04:23.559 align:start position:0%
branch like we have to be very careful
 
01:04:25.109 --> 01:04:25.119 align:start position:0%
where there's a separation of the
 
01:04:27.990 --> 01:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
branches in the judicial branch they you
 
01:04:29.710 --> 01:04:29.720 align:start position:0%
know we're looking at judicial training
 
01:04:31.710 --> 01:04:31.720 align:start position:0%
are they trained properly to be able to
 
01:04:33.109 --> 01:04:33.119 align:start position:0%
do all this so that's something that we
 
01:04:35.029 --> 01:04:35.039 align:start position:0%
can look at but when it comes to their
 
01:04:37.190 --> 01:04:37.200 align:start position:0%
discretion we have to make sure that
 
01:04:39.589 --> 01:04:39.599 align:start position:0%
we're not um overlapping on their
 
01:04:42.109 --> 01:04:42.119 align:start position:0%
discretion in their particular court is
 
01:04:44.470 --> 01:04:44.480 align:start position:0%
because somebody could bring in I mean
 
01:04:46.230 --> 01:04:46.240 align:start position:0%
years of things that they think is
 
01:04:47.990 --> 01:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
relevant because they're trying to do
 
01:04:49.789 --> 01:04:49.799 align:start position:0%
whatever so we have to I mean if you
 
01:04:52.230 --> 01:04:52.240 align:start position:0%
think about you know well I feel really
 
01:04:53.470 --> 01:04:53.480 align:start position:0%
strongly about something so I'm going to
 
01:04:55.349 --> 01:04:55.359 align:start position:0%
give you 5,000 witnesses that can say
 
01:04:57.510 --> 01:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
that saw me smile at this point I'm not
 
01:04:59.549 --> 01:04:59.559 align:start position:0%
you know all these different things so
 
01:05:02.710 --> 01:05:02.720 align:start position:0%
that's a really um I I see uh
 
01:05:04.430 --> 01:05:04.440 align:start position:0%
representative kof's point and we did
 
01:05:06.950 --> 01:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
talk about that at Great length but it's
 
01:05:08.710 --> 01:05:08.720 align:start position:0%
everything with families is complicated
 
01:05:10.510 --> 01:05:10.520 align:start position:0%
this is another one of those but there
 
01:05:12.349 --> 01:05:12.359 align:start position:0%
is certainly a separation between the
 
01:05:13.829 --> 01:05:13.839 align:start position:0%
branches here that we have to
 
01:05:15.950 --> 01:05:15.960 align:start position:0%
acknowledge thank you um I think that's
 
01:05:17.789 --> 01:05:17.799 align:start position:0%
a good point but I think we need to also
 
01:05:19.349 --> 01:05:19.359 align:start position:0%
make sure we have a list of all of these
 
01:05:20.910 --> 01:05:20.920 align:start position:0%
things that are critical to the due
 
01:05:22.630 --> 01:05:22.640 align:start position:0%
process even if it's being done
 
01:05:24.990 --> 01:05:25.000 align:start position:0%
underneath another committee that we
 
01:05:26.950 --> 01:05:26.960 align:start position:0%
continue to follow up and make sure that
 
01:05:28.390 --> 01:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
that's moving forward and watch it
 
01:05:30.190 --> 01:05:30.200 align:start position:0%
through the entire process because we
 
01:05:32.990 --> 01:05:33.000 align:start position:0%
could weigh in as a special committee to
 
01:05:34.950 --> 01:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
ensure that this is passed all the way
 
01:05:36.750 --> 01:05:36.760 align:start position:0%
and becomes law because this does seem
 
01:05:38.069 --> 01:05:38.079 align:start position:0%
to be an absolutely critical
 
01:05:39.910 --> 01:05:39.920 align:start position:0%
underpinning so I think that interface
 
01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
would be appropriate representative
 
01:05:44.109 --> 01:05:44.119 align:start position:0%
Weber well if you're keeping your list
 
01:05:47.269 --> 01:05:47.279 align:start position:0%
and I again it's overstepping on several
 
01:05:50.029 --> 01:05:50.039 align:start position:0%
committees here but the lack of judicial
 
01:05:54.309 --> 01:05:54.319 align:start position:0%
resources is very much an issue here and
 
01:05:56.269 --> 01:05:56.279 align:start position:0%
when you have a court that has scheduled
 
01:05:58.309 --> 01:05:58.319 align:start position:0%
a hearing and this is in every single
 
01:06:00.910 --> 01:06:00.920 align:start position:0%
kind of court case I'm thinking of the
 
01:06:03.789 --> 01:06:03.799 align:start position:0%
probate courts as well um when there's
 
01:06:07.069 --> 01:06:07.079 align:start position:0%
one hour and somebody has taken up 45
 
01:06:10.870 --> 01:06:10.880 align:start position:0%
minutes to present one side of a case
 
01:06:12.950 --> 01:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
then you get 15 minutes and then the
 
01:06:15.109 --> 01:06:15.119 align:start position:0%
court says well I have to stop now and
 
01:06:18.589 --> 01:06:18.599 align:start position:0%
you can come back a month from now and
 
01:06:22.630 --> 01:06:22.640 align:start position:0%
that is incredibly frustrating to the
 
01:06:26.269 --> 01:06:26.279 align:start position:0%
litigant and it is something that
 
01:06:29.150 --> 01:06:29.160 align:start position:0%
that the only way of addressing that is
 
01:06:31.309 --> 01:06:31.319 align:start position:0%
more Court resources so that's a whole
 
01:06:34.470 --> 01:06:34.480 align:start position:0%
different ball of wax but it has a huge
 
01:06:37.829 --> 01:06:37.839 align:start position:0%
effect on um individual litigants and
 
01:06:40.109 --> 01:06:40.119 align:start position:0%
how they perceive the system and how the
 
01:06:42.750 --> 01:06:42.760 align:start position:0%
system actually acts in their cases so
 
01:06:44.589 --> 01:06:44.599 align:start position:0%
just keep it in the back of our minds
 
01:06:46.789 --> 01:06:46.799 align:start position:0%
it's not our Bailey Wick but it's one of
 
01:06:49.589 --> 01:06:49.599 align:start position:0%
those things that has a huge impact on
 
01:06:51.190 --> 01:06:51.200 align:start position:0%
exactly the sorts of things that we're
 
01:06:52.950 --> 01:06:52.960 align:start position:0%
talking about here uh thank you and that
 
01:06:54.910 --> 01:06:54.920 align:start position:0%
brings up the issue of siloing if we
 
01:06:56.109 --> 01:06:56.119 align:start position:0%
always say something think somebody
 
01:06:57.910 --> 01:06:57.920 align:start position:0%
else's job it gets to be a challenge so
 
01:06:59.269 --> 01:06:59.279 align:start position:0%
if we know where to follow up with
 
01:07:01.069 --> 01:07:01.079 align:start position:0%
others it's good to make sure that
 
01:07:02.950 --> 01:07:02.960 align:start position:0%
nothing's dropped representative
 
01:07:06.230 --> 01:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
kofalt thank you so um first of all I
 
01:07:08.430 --> 01:07:08.440 align:start position:0%
think that is a very good point we do
 
01:07:11.230 --> 01:07:11.240 align:start position:0%
hear that a lot about um Court
 
01:07:14.950 --> 01:07:14.960 align:start position:0%
resources um just to follow up on the
 
01:07:16.589 --> 01:07:16.599 align:start position:0%
the bill that you mentioned that is H
 
01:07:16.599 --> 01:07:17.670 align:start position:0%
the bill that you mentioned that is H
Bill

01:07:17.670 --> 01:07:17.680 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
01:07:21.029 --> 01:07:21.039 align:start position:0%
475 um it did go over to the Senate it
 
01:07:23.510 --> 01:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
was had a hearing in Senate
 
01:07:25.990 --> 01:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
Judiciary uh who recommended interim
 
01:07:28.309 --> 01:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
study and we'll go to the senate floor
 
01:07:28.319 --> 01:07:30.109 align:start position:0%
study and we'll go to the senate floor
on

01:07:30.109 --> 01:07:30.119 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:07:32.710 --> 01:07:32.720 align:start position:0%
Thursday so I guess that it was it was a
 
01:07:35.309 --> 01:07:35.319 align:start position:0%
five to nothing vote in judiciary thank
 
01:07:37.109 --> 01:07:37.119 align:start position:0%
you that's helpful but disappointing
 
01:07:39.269 --> 01:07:39.279 align:start position:0%
information so it seems that this is not
 
01:07:41.670 --> 01:07:41.680 align:start position:0%
yet handled so we should make sure that
 
01:07:43.349 --> 01:07:43.359 align:start position:0%
the Senate will be working on this and
 
01:07:45.510 --> 01:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
hopefully the special committee on the
 
01:07:47.150 --> 01:07:47.160 align:start position:0%
Family Court will be working with them
 
01:07:48.390 --> 01:07:48.400 align:start position:0%
to make sure that they understand the
 
01:07:50.630 --> 01:07:50.640 align:start position:0%
importance of this representative long
 
01:07:52.910 --> 01:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
yeah and just uh briefly uh there's
 
01:07:56.109 --> 01:07:56.119 align:start position:0%
amendments coming forward which can add
 
01:07:59.430 --> 01:07:59.440 align:start position:0%
that fantastic we know we know how to
 
01:08:01.190 --> 01:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
work the process as well as the other
 
01:08:04.750 --> 01:08:04.760 align:start position:0%
body that makes me feel good thank
 
01:08:07.390 --> 01:08:07.400 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you I think we've had
 
01:08:09.309 --> 01:08:09.319 align:start position:0%
some great conversation great dialogue
 
01:08:10.789 --> 01:08:10.799 align:start position:0%
and I think we move forward in this with
 
01:08:12.789 --> 01:08:12.799 align:start position:0%
some areas to look into I will follow up
 
01:08:15.309 --> 01:08:15.319 align:start position:0%
with inviting people in with information
 
01:08:18.229 --> 01:08:18.239 align:start position:0%
um but with that um I'm going to close
 
01:08:23.870 --> 01:08:23.880 align:start position:0%
our work session and um and then we will
 
01:08:28.229 --> 01:08:28.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:30.269 --> 01:08:30.279 align:start position:0%
sorry long standing is my cough for a
 
01:08:33.070 --> 01:08:33.080 align:start position:0%
long time after I get better so with
 
01:08:34.829 --> 01:08:34.839 align:start position:0%
this I will open up the regular
 
01:08:36.390 --> 01:08:36.400 align:start position:0%
committee where we will be hearing from
 
01:08:39.309 --> 01:08:39.319 align:start position:0%
members of the public um so first I want
 
01:08:41.990 --> 01:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
to set just a couple of
 
01:08:44.910 --> 01:08:44.920 align:start position:0%
expectations um guard rails guidelines
 
01:08:47.910 --> 01:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
as we do this if you've never spoken in
 
01:08:50.630 --> 01:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
front of a committee like this before it
 
01:08:52.149 --> 01:08:52.159 align:start position:0%
can be a little more than you're
 
01:08:53.829 --> 01:08:53.839 align:start position:0%
expecting before you sit down at the
 
01:08:56.309 --> 01:08:56.319 align:start position:0%
microphone um and for that I would ask
 
01:08:58.110 --> 01:08:58.120 align:start position:0%
anybody who hasn't done this before to
 
01:08:59.269 --> 01:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
let me know and I'm going to give you
 
01:09:00.709 --> 01:09:00.719 align:start position:0%
two minutes just to start getting your
 
01:09:03.630 --> 01:09:03.640 align:start position:0%
feet and then we'll pause see if that's
 
01:09:05.709 --> 01:09:05.719 align:start position:0%
see where you are if you're if you're
 
01:09:07.189 --> 01:09:07.199 align:start position:0%
moving forward pretty well and how
 
01:09:09.390 --> 01:09:09.400 align:start position:0%
you're saying this um might want to give
 
01:09:11.829 --> 01:09:11.839 align:start position:0%
you some feedback on how best to present
 
01:09:13.430 --> 01:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
yourself because I know that some people
 
01:09:14.910 --> 01:09:14.920 align:start position:0%
when they come up and they speak for a
 
01:09:16.709 --> 01:09:16.719 align:start position:0%
long time it gets to be kind of
 
01:09:18.149 --> 01:09:18.159 align:start position:0%
challenging I've been in that seat
 
01:09:20.630 --> 01:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
before many times um so this is in order
 
01:09:22.349 --> 01:09:22.359 align:start position:0%
to be supportive so we'll let you know
 
01:09:24.269 --> 01:09:24.279 align:start position:0%
after about 2 minutes and then then to
 
01:09:25.990 --> 01:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
be able to continue on
 
01:09:28.149 --> 01:09:28.159 align:start position:0%
we are not saying names this is about
 
01:09:29.590 --> 01:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
the policies this is about the
 
01:09:31.430 --> 01:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
procedures this is about making sure
 
01:09:33.709 --> 01:09:33.719 align:start position:0%
that everything as we move forward is
 
01:09:37.430 --> 01:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
done correctly um if we get into blaming
 
01:09:39.110 --> 01:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
any particular people then it's going to
 
01:09:40.749 --> 01:09:40.759 align:start position:0%
be a lot harder to actually fix it
 
01:09:42.149 --> 01:09:42.159 align:start position:0%
because when somebody gets blamed they
 
01:09:43.309 --> 01:09:43.319 align:start position:0%
dig in their heels and they don't want
 
01:09:44.470 --> 01:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
to admit they' they've done anything
 
01:09:46.669 --> 01:09:46.679 align:start position:0%
wrong um that's not going to get any of
 
01:09:49.510 --> 01:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
us to the solution that we want um and
 
01:09:51.309 --> 01:09:51.319 align:start position:0%
so for that I ask that you keep names
 
01:09:54.630 --> 01:09:54.640 align:start position:0%
out of it um so that we can fix things
 
01:09:56.950 --> 01:09:56.960 align:start position:0%
um as opposed to getting getting stuck
 
01:10:00.830 --> 01:10:00.840 align:start position:0%
in more of a accusatory phase um so and
 
01:10:02.550 --> 01:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
I know that it can be emotional so this
 
01:10:04.189 --> 01:10:04.199 align:start position:0%
time we brought some tissues if anybody
 
01:10:06.790 --> 01:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
needs them because it can be C up there
 
01:10:07.990 --> 01:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
especially when you're talking about
 
01:10:09.709 --> 01:10:09.719 align:start position:0%
something as personal and important as
 
01:10:12.070 --> 01:10:12.080 align:start position:0%
your life um and if you need to pause it
 
01:10:14.430 --> 01:10:14.440 align:start position:0%
all you can pause when you're speaking
 
01:10:16.990 --> 01:10:17.000 align:start position:0%
um because this is recorded on YouTube
 
01:10:19.229 --> 01:10:19.239 align:start position:0%
it will be there if you have any open
 
01:10:21.350 --> 01:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
cases or anything else this is public
 
01:10:23.750 --> 01:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
information and as members of the public
 
01:10:25.470 --> 01:10:25.480 align:start position:0%
your speech here is not protected the
 
01:10:26.990 --> 01:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
same way that legislator speech is
 
01:10:30.590 --> 01:10:30.600 align:start position:0%
protected so speak generally don't give
 
01:10:32.390 --> 01:10:32.400 align:start position:0%
us information that will cause harm to
 
01:10:35.709 --> 01:10:35.719 align:start position:0%
you or to your family um so with that um
 
01:10:38.910 --> 01:10:38.920 align:start position:0%
I would like to welcome up anamarie
 
01:10:41.149 --> 01:10:41.159 align:start position:0%
deato if she's not here that's our no
 
01:10:42.310 --> 01:10:42.320 align:start position:0%
that's all right I can grab the next
 
01:10:43.590 --> 01:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
person and get her but if you want to
 
01:10:48.709 --> 01:10:48.719 align:start position:0%
let her know um okay um Eric
 
01:10:50.910 --> 01:10:50.920 align:start position:0%
Blair okay now we ready yet not a
 
01:10:52.470 --> 01:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
problem I'm happy to push people back
 
01:10:54.229 --> 01:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
this is a different experience for
 
01:10:56.149 --> 01:10:56.159 align:start position:0%
people skip Murphy you've asked for
 
01:10:56.159 --> 01:10:57.310 align:start position:0%
people skip Murphy you've asked for
three

01:10:57.310 --> 01:10:57.320 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:10:59.550 --> 01:10:59.560 align:start position:0%
minutes and I know you're a pro at this
 
01:11:03.669 --> 01:11:03.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:08.830 --> 01:11:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:11.590 --> 01:11:11.600 align:start position:0%
amateur that would
 
01:11:15.189 --> 01:11:15.199 align:start position:0%
fit um I'm glad to see that a lot of
 
01:11:20.709 --> 01:11:20.719 align:start position:0%
time was spent on the EXP parte uh issue
 
01:11:23.950 --> 01:11:23.960 align:start position:0%
as representative Weber brought up and
 
01:11:25.790 --> 01:11:25.800 align:start position:0%
described the process
 
01:11:27.990 --> 01:11:28.000 align:start position:0%
in very good
 
01:11:31.030 --> 01:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
detail my personal
 
01:11:34.350 --> 01:11:34.360 align:start position:0%
entanglements uh with DCF often times
 
01:11:36.910 --> 01:11:36.920 align:start position:0%
have had the EXP parte at which point
 
01:11:40.390 --> 01:11:40.400 align:start position:0%
the parents if this was a reality TV Jim
 
01:11:42.790 --> 01:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
kofalt has put it their the Liberty
 
01:11:45.950 --> 01:11:45.960 align:start position:0%
issue is the removal of their child from
 
01:11:49.470 --> 01:11:49.480 align:start position:0%
them now maybe some of those parents
 
01:11:53.070 --> 01:11:53.080 align:start position:0%
understood maybe they
 
01:11:55.270 --> 01:11:55.280 align:start position:0%
didn't I think that that is something
 
01:11:57.830 --> 01:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
something that really needs a lot of
 
01:12:00.270 --> 01:12:00.280 align:start position:0%
looking at when it comes to the due
 
01:12:01.830 --> 01:12:01.840 align:start position:0%
process and I know that representative
 
01:12:05.110 --> 01:12:05.120 align:start position:0%
Greg mentioned uh the bill that is going
 
01:12:08.669 --> 01:12:08.679 align:start position:0%
through uh Jim said HB 475 I'm not
 
01:12:10.990 --> 01:12:11.000 align:start position:0%
familiar with it I'm going to look at it
 
01:12:14.870 --> 01:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
because that's I'm a wonk at some point
 
01:12:17.990 --> 01:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
still not a professional
 
01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:19.950 align:start position:0%
still not a professional
representatively

01:12:19.950 --> 01:12:19.960 align:start position:0%
representatively
 
01:12:22.750 --> 01:12:22.760 align:start position:0%
um also I think that the big deal that
 
01:12:25.390 --> 01:12:25.400 align:start position:0%
really needs to be looked at is what is
 
01:12:27.870 --> 01:12:27.880 align:start position:0%
that dividing line between voluntary and
 
01:12:30.629 --> 01:12:30.639 align:start position:0%
coercion because everybody who gets
 
01:12:33.950 --> 01:12:33.960 align:start position:0%
involved in this as a parent it's like
 
01:12:36.950 --> 01:12:36.960 align:start position:0%
the IRS we can put you in jail and take
 
01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:38.310 align:start position:0%
the IRS we can put you in jail and take
your

01:12:38.310 --> 01:12:38.320 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:12:42.030 --> 01:12:42.040 align:start position:0%
money as far as DCF is concerned we'll
 
01:12:43.790 --> 01:12:43.800 align:start position:0%
just take something that's even more
 
01:12:46.590 --> 01:12:46.600 align:start position:0%
valuable to you in most cases which is
 
01:12:49.390 --> 01:12:49.400 align:start position:0%
your child and yes I understand there
 
01:12:51.669 --> 01:12:51.679 align:start position:0%
are parents out there who could care
 
01:12:55.550 --> 01:12:55.560 align:start position:0%
less about their child I run into them
 
01:12:57.310 --> 01:12:57.320 align:start position:0%
so there's always the good there's
 
01:13:00.229 --> 01:13:00.239 align:start position:0%
always the bad as I said in the first
 
01:13:03.510 --> 01:13:03.520 align:start position:0%
hearing this is a bipartisan issue
 
01:13:05.310 --> 01:13:05.320 align:start position:0%
there's going to be good and bad on both
 
01:13:07.669 --> 01:13:07.679 align:start position:0%
sides but it's all should always be
 
01:13:08.709 --> 01:13:08.719 align:start position:0%
about the
 
01:13:12.110 --> 01:13:12.120 align:start position:0%
child I will let you know and I know my
 
01:13:14.189 --> 01:13:14.199 align:start position:0%
three minutes is coming to an
 
01:13:16.910 --> 01:13:16.920 align:start position:0%
end a lot of the training that my wife
 
01:13:19.990 --> 01:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
and I have taken voluntarily talks about
 
01:13:22.270 --> 01:13:22.280 align:start position:0%
the trauma to the child of what has
 
01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:23.350 align:start position:0%
the trauma to the child of what has
happened

01:13:23.350 --> 01:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
happened
 
01:13:25.669 --> 01:13:25.679 align:start position:0%
before and also
 
01:13:28.750 --> 01:13:28.760 align:start position:0%
what goes on during the placement of
 
01:13:32.430 --> 01:13:32.440 align:start position:0%
that child with one or more foster
 
01:13:36.030 --> 01:13:36.040 align:start position:0%
parents it is very obvious that the kids
 
01:13:39.669 --> 01:13:39.679 align:start position:0%
get scared and then they get numbed oh I
 
01:13:42.310 --> 01:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
have to go somewhere else I'm being
 
01:13:46.030 --> 01:13:46.040 align:start position:0%
moved to another foster home it may be
 
01:13:47.950 --> 01:13:47.960 align:start position:0%
because of their behavior and it may
 
01:13:51.390 --> 01:13:51.400 align:start position:0%
just be the foster parents have said
 
01:13:53.270 --> 01:13:53.280 align:start position:0%
there's other things going on in our
 
01:13:56.590 --> 01:13:56.600 align:start position:0%
lives we can't do that but I think that
 
01:14:01.229 --> 01:14:01.239 align:start position:0%
also needs a little due process for the
 
01:14:03.950 --> 01:14:03.960 align:start position:0%
child and represent of Greg to your
 
01:14:06.110 --> 01:14:06.120 align:start position:0%
point about getting a lawyer appointed
 
01:14:08.310 --> 01:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
for the
 
01:14:11.629 --> 01:14:11.639 align:start position:0%
child the situations that I have been in
 
01:14:14.229 --> 01:14:14.239 align:start position:0%
and we have just started our fifth
 
01:14:16.310 --> 01:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
entanglement is that a guardian medle
 
01:14:18.910 --> 01:14:18.920 align:start position:0%
item is is appointed usually from the
 
01:14:23.270 --> 01:14:23.280 align:start position:0%
ranks of Casa to represent that child in
 
01:14:25.830 --> 01:14:25.840 align:start position:0%
all uh legal proceedings
 
01:14:28.590 --> 01:14:28.600 align:start position:0%
and I will tell you that in the last one
 
01:14:31.270 --> 01:14:31.280 align:start position:0%
the weight of her testimony and her line
 
01:14:33.430 --> 01:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
of questioning during the
 
01:14:36.590 --> 01:14:36.600 align:start position:0%
hearings was such that the child got a
 
01:14:40.270 --> 01:14:40.280 align:start position:0%
lot more services intensive Services
 
01:14:43.110 --> 01:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
than what otherwise would have happened
 
01:14:45.470 --> 01:14:45.480 align:start position:0%
so I think it's a good thing that it
 
01:14:48.550 --> 01:14:48.560 align:start position:0%
comes foremost but it's also already
 
01:14:51.430 --> 01:14:51.440 align:start position:0%
covered and I just bring that up I'm
 
01:14:52.910 --> 01:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
assuming that you already know about the
 
01:14:55.510 --> 01:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
G's and the work of C
 
01:14:58.350 --> 01:14:58.360 align:start position:0%
so I'm not quite sure where the the
 
01:15:01.030 --> 01:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
actual lawyer part comes in because the
 
01:15:03.750 --> 01:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
gal's that I've run into they are
 
01:15:06.110 --> 01:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
vociferous they do not hold back in
 
01:15:08.470 --> 01:15:08.480 align:start position:0%
court which is a good thing and with
 
01:15:11.629 --> 01:15:11.639 align:start position:0%
that thank you thank you very much are
 
01:15:13.550 --> 01:15:13.560 align:start position:0%
there any are you taking questions if
 
01:15:16.189 --> 01:15:16.199 align:start position:0%
there are any sure absolutely although I
 
01:15:17.830 --> 01:15:17.840 align:start position:0%
don't I don't see any sorry to make you
 
01:15:19.550 --> 01:15:19.560 align:start position:0%
sit back down but thank you very much I
 
01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:20.790 align:start position:0%
sit back down but thank you very much I
appreciate

01:15:20.790 --> 01:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
appreciate
 
01:15:23.189 --> 01:15:23.199 align:start position:0%
that um an Marie
 
01:15:25.750 --> 01:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
deato so I just so since you weren't in
 
01:15:27.390 --> 01:15:27.400 align:start position:0%
the room when I was first giving the
 
01:15:29.149 --> 01:15:29.159 align:start position:0%
information um if you want to sit down
 
01:15:30.470 --> 01:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
make yourself comfortable and I'll just
 
01:15:32.350 --> 01:15:32.360 align:start position:0%
tell you sort of some of what we set up
 
01:15:33.669 --> 01:15:33.679 align:start position:0%
just to make it easier for people who
 
01:15:35.790 --> 01:15:35.800 align:start position:0%
haven't testified before um have you
 
01:15:37.030 --> 01:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
come in and testified before the
 
01:15:39.590 --> 01:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
legislature much before um then I'm
 
01:15:41.310 --> 01:15:41.320 align:start position:0%
going so what we're doing is we're not
 
01:15:43.110 --> 01:15:43.120 align:start position:0%
discussing names we're discussing the
 
01:15:45.669 --> 01:15:45.679 align:start position:0%
policies if you have anything that's
 
01:15:48.149 --> 01:15:48.159 align:start position:0%
active um just be careful about what
 
01:15:50.390 --> 01:15:50.400 align:start position:0%
information you share because what you
 
01:15:52.950 --> 01:15:52.960 align:start position:0%
say here is um what you say here is
 
01:15:54.390 --> 01:15:54.400 align:start position:0%
public it's recorded it will be on
 
01:15:54.400 --> 01:15:55.430 align:start position:0%
public it's recorded it will be on
YouTube

01:15:55.430 --> 01:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
YouTube
 
01:15:57.189 --> 01:15:57.199 align:start position:0%
uh but it's important to get information
 
01:15:58.950 --> 01:15:58.960 align:start position:0%
out here so that you can have the
 
01:16:01.110 --> 01:16:01.120 align:start position:0%
information and share it with uh share
 
01:16:03.470 --> 01:16:03.480 align:start position:0%
what we need to know about the policies
 
01:16:05.550 --> 01:16:05.560 align:start position:0%
um that are impacting you which are why
 
01:16:07.350 --> 01:16:07.360 align:start position:0%
you're here since you haven't spoken
 
01:16:08.709 --> 01:16:08.719 align:start position:0%
before I'm going to give you two minutes
 
01:16:10.110 --> 01:16:10.120 align:start position:0%
just to sort of get your footing then
 
01:16:11.750 --> 01:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
I'll have you pause take a deep breath
 
01:16:13.390 --> 01:16:13.400 align:start position:0%
and then we'll figure out how much more
 
01:16:15.629 --> 01:16:15.639 align:start position:0%
time you want to continue just because
 
01:16:17.310 --> 01:16:17.320 align:start position:0%
staring at a 10-minute block of times a
 
01:16:20.149 --> 01:16:20.159 align:start position:0%
lot and just want to make sure that you
 
01:16:21.709 --> 01:16:21.719 align:start position:0%
have all the support and encouragement
 
01:16:24.070 --> 01:16:24.080 align:start position:0%
that you can have right here so with
 
01:16:26.750 --> 01:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
that um I'm going to let you start up
 
01:16:28.350 --> 01:16:28.360 align:start position:0%
with h two minutes start getting some
 
01:16:30.910 --> 01:16:30.920 align:start position:0%
information to us and then we'll pause
 
01:16:33.870 --> 01:16:33.880 align:start position:0%
so thank you I S to tell the whole truth
 
01:16:37.229 --> 01:16:37.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:41.950 --> 01:16:41.960 align:start position:0%
God my name is Anna Marie jamato and um
 
01:16:44.870 --> 01:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
my situation relationship experience
 
01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:45.550 align:start position:0%
my situation relationship experience
with

01:16:45.550 --> 01:16:45.560 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:16:50.870 --> 01:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
DCF um came where um it was a very brief
 
01:16:53.430 --> 01:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
they have been they've checked in on me
 
01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:55.830 align:start position:0%
they have been they've checked in on me
for

01:16:55.830 --> 01:16:55.840 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:16:58.110 --> 01:16:58.120 align:start position:0%
um my son's lead was high and I missed
 
01:17:00.750 --> 01:17:00.760 align:start position:0%
the doctor's appointment um but in any
 
01:17:03.350 --> 01:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
event so I've had and then um the
 
01:17:04.910 --> 01:17:04.920 align:start position:0%
neighbor's cat got out and my son was
 
01:17:08.189 --> 01:17:08.199 align:start position:0%
chasing around the backyard so a couple
 
01:17:10.390 --> 01:17:10.400 align:start position:0%
of these cases well nothing had gone
 
01:17:14.910 --> 01:17:14.920 align:start position:0%
founded correct um so I'll just leading
 
01:17:17.990 --> 01:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
you up to I had a guardianship case with
 
01:17:21.709 --> 01:17:21.719 align:start position:0%
my family which closed and upon that
 
01:17:23.950 --> 01:17:23.960 align:start position:0%
closing the guardian at Lighting in that
 
01:17:27.590 --> 01:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
closing um and I had discussed there
 
01:17:30.910 --> 01:17:30.920 align:start position:0%
being a voluntary case opened with DCF
 
01:17:32.310 --> 01:17:32.320 align:start position:0%
and that was part of the Clause to close
 
01:17:35.270 --> 01:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
the guardianship so the Guardians ship
 
01:17:39.350 --> 01:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
was closed and lo and behold DCF
 
01:17:41.590 --> 01:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
screamed it out and didn't open a
 
01:17:44.669 --> 01:17:44.679 align:start position:0%
voluntary case with me now I this comes
 
01:17:47.430 --> 01:17:47.440 align:start position:0%
because you know I mean I'm a single mom
 
01:17:49.910 --> 01:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
and my son at the time
 
01:17:53.990 --> 01:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
was three three to four and it had been
 
01:17:56.629 --> 01:17:56.639 align:start position:0%
just him and I all day like all day
 
01:17:59.750 --> 01:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
every day and so I was I was certainly
 
01:18:02.950 --> 01:18:02.960 align:start position:0%
taxed um I had a really hard time
 
01:18:05.709 --> 01:18:05.719 align:start position:0%
finding Child Care uh I don't want to
 
01:18:07.709 --> 01:18:07.719 align:start position:0%
get too far off from this but I just so
 
01:18:11.910 --> 01:18:11.920 align:start position:0%
I just um want to explain or tell you so
 
01:18:13.910 --> 01:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
there was I could have used some help
 
01:18:15.830 --> 01:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
some networking some some whatever their
 
01:18:19.629 --> 01:18:19.639 align:start position:0%
services were um supposed to be I
 
01:18:22.830 --> 01:18:22.840 align:start position:0%
certainly probably could have used that
 
01:18:27.830 --> 01:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:30.750 --> 01:18:30.760 align:start position:0%
my case or whatever and so there there
 
01:18:33.750 --> 01:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
was no case so I'm gonna you're two
 
01:18:36.270 --> 01:18:36.280 align:start position:0%
minutes in you're doing an amazing job
 
01:18:38.470 --> 01:18:38.480 align:start position:0%
so keep keep going I'll give you another
 
01:18:39.990 --> 01:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
seven minutes to keep talking you're
 
01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:43.030 align:start position:0%
seven minutes to keep talking you're
doing

01:18:43.030 --> 01:18:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:49.229 --> 01:18:49.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:56.110 --> 01:18:56.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:57.830 --> 01:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
you I didn't mean to knock you off what
 
01:18:59.470 --> 01:18:59.480 align:start position:0%
you were saying you're amazing you're a
 
01:19:01.070 --> 01:19:01.080 align:start position:0%
rock star taking care of your son and
 
01:19:03.229 --> 01:19:03.239 align:start position:0%
doing all of this and I'm really sorry
 
01:19:05.430 --> 01:19:05.440 align:start position:0%
that DCF didn't give you the supports
 
01:19:07.790 --> 01:19:07.800 align:start position:0%
you were asking for so me too after you
 
01:19:09.390 --> 01:19:09.400 align:start position:0%
take a deep breath let us know what you
 
01:19:14.149 --> 01:19:14.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:19.430 --> 01:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
happened so then uh let's see in May a
 
01:19:22.830 --> 01:19:22.840 align:start position:0%
so my son turned five in April of
 
01:19:25.350 --> 01:19:25.360 align:start position:0%
2021 and he got a bite for his
 
01:19:28.590 --> 01:19:28.600 align:start position:0%
birthday and at the time I lived on a
 
01:19:32.270 --> 01:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
class six Road in starter not one car
 
01:19:34.310 --> 01:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
would drive by during the day other you
 
01:19:36.229 --> 01:19:36.239 align:start position:0%
know quite
 
01:19:39.229 --> 01:19:39.239 align:start position:0%
remote and I felt confident and secure
 
01:19:41.870 --> 01:19:41.880 align:start position:0%
in letting him ride his bike um and so
 
01:19:44.590 --> 01:19:44.600 align:start position:0%
and and that was apparent I grew up in
 
01:19:47.590 --> 01:19:47.600 align:start position:0%
Vermont and I you know was glad to be in
 
01:19:50.750 --> 01:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
sted and and raising my son in
 
01:19:53.430 --> 01:19:53.440 align:start position:0%
environment as close as as as I could to
 
01:19:58.149 --> 01:19:58.159 align:start position:0%
my own so my son
 
01:20:01.750 --> 01:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
um dcy was called because my son was
 
01:20:04.430 --> 01:20:04.440 align:start position:0%
found riding his bike without me then he
 
01:20:08.390 --> 01:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
was found you know and so then I get a
 
01:20:09.830 --> 01:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
visit from
 
01:20:13.110 --> 01:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
DCF and there there
 
01:20:16.310 --> 01:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
were also I'm sorry we call it a race
 
01:20:17.990 --> 01:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
car of a brain my son has the same thing
 
01:20:20.110 --> 01:20:20.120 align:start position:0%
as I do and we don't really call it what
 
01:20:21.750 --> 01:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
it is but that's a true statement we
 
01:20:25.229 --> 01:20:25.239 align:start position:0%
both have that so pardon me for that um
 
01:20:28.790 --> 01:20:28.800 align:start position:0%
stacking wood one day and I you know
 
01:20:30.870 --> 01:20:30.880 align:start position:0%
just blow my arms up with wood and I
 
01:20:32.669 --> 01:20:32.679 align:start position:0%
turned around and he's gone now he was
 
01:20:34.550 --> 01:20:34.560 align:start position:0%
down at sand pile which was you know
 
01:20:36.910 --> 01:20:36.920 align:start position:0%
less than 20 yards away from me in any
 
01:20:40.750 --> 01:20:40.760 align:start position:0%
event um I wasn't scared I wasn't scared
 
01:20:42.950 --> 01:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
I knew he he was close by he can't run
 
01:20:44.870 --> 01:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
faster than I can and you know but
 
01:20:47.390 --> 01:20:47.400 align:start position:0%
whatever he was doing he thought that he
 
01:20:49.790 --> 01:20:49.800 align:start position:0%
could utilize something somewhere else
 
01:20:53.390 --> 01:20:53.400 align:start position:0%
and so you know he was gone it wasn't um
 
01:20:55.189 --> 01:20:55.199 align:start position:0%
a neglect on my part
 
01:20:57.750 --> 01:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
it wasn't um a conscious parenting
 
01:21:01.270 --> 01:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
Choice even though my parenting style
 
01:21:05.070 --> 01:21:05.080 align:start position:0%
is off from what you know the general
 
01:21:07.110 --> 01:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
streamline is but I had put a lot of
 
01:21:09.070 --> 01:21:09.080 align:start position:0%
time into my parenting style having
 
01:21:12.149 --> 01:21:12.159 align:start position:0%
wanted a child for so long and not being
 
01:21:13.590 --> 01:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
able to have one and having one like I
 
01:21:15.149 --> 01:21:15.159 align:start position:0%
was blessed with that so it didn't it's
 
01:21:17.149 --> 01:21:17.159 align:start position:0%
not like on a whim all my parenting
 
01:21:20.430 --> 01:21:20.440 align:start position:0%
choices like I I haven't tension with my
 
01:21:22.510 --> 01:21:22.520 align:start position:0%
parenting but they didn't hear that they
 
01:21:23.550 --> 01:21:23.560 align:start position:0%
just heard I'm not going to be a
 
01:21:25.990 --> 01:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
helicopter parent and and you know that
 
01:21:28.629 --> 01:21:28.639 align:start position:0%
I had my an alternative parenting style
 
01:21:31.709 --> 01:21:31.719 align:start position:0%
and so in any event um the this is why
 
01:21:35.270 --> 01:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
DC was called was because of my son and
 
01:21:38.590 --> 01:21:38.600 align:start position:0%
and now mind you um we'd put alarms on
 
01:21:41.390 --> 01:21:41.400 align:start position:0%
the doors i' installed video cameras in
 
01:21:43.910 --> 01:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
in inside and outside my home um we took
 
01:21:46.629 --> 01:21:46.639 align:start position:0%
away his bike uh we were we had a
 
01:21:48.790 --> 01:21:48.800 align:start position:0%
conversation with him um but I was
 
01:21:50.870 --> 01:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
taking the steps that any other parent
 
01:21:52.870 --> 01:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
or family would take to rectify this
 
01:21:54.870 --> 01:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
issue you know I had been already going
 
01:21:58.310 --> 01:21:58.320 align:start position:0%
to a parenting U group and and support
 
01:22:02.709 --> 01:22:02.719 align:start position:0%
for the ters and and and such and so I
 
01:22:04.229 --> 01:22:04.239 align:start position:0%
wasn't the only one that has having this
 
01:22:06.830 --> 01:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
problem at five years old like and it
 
01:22:09.189 --> 01:22:09.199 align:start position:0%
was a topic of discussion in fact the
 
01:22:12.510 --> 01:22:12.520 align:start position:0%
very day that they came uh in late May
 
01:22:12.520 --> 01:22:14.430 align:start position:0%
very day that they came uh in late May
of

01:22:14.430 --> 01:22:14.440 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:22:18.149 --> 01:22:18.159 align:start position:0%
2021 they came the very next day and
 
01:22:20.669 --> 01:22:20.679 align:start position:0%
with the next parte and they
 
01:22:23.550 --> 01:22:23.560 align:start position:0%
took I haven't seen my son back in my
 
01:22:27.590 --> 01:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
home since and I've been fighting really
 
01:22:31.149 --> 01:22:31.159 align:start position:0%
hard the whole case plan that they had
 
01:22:34.070 --> 01:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
laid out um were already things that I
 
01:22:35.669 --> 01:22:35.679 align:start position:0%
had already been doing I told you about
 
01:22:37.709 --> 01:22:37.719 align:start position:0%
the guardianship case so I had already
 
01:22:40.750 --> 01:22:40.760 align:start position:0%
had a parenting educator and and a
 
01:22:44.270 --> 01:22:44.280 align:start position:0%
counselor LC and and
 
01:22:47.030 --> 01:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
um counselor for the for the a family
 
01:22:48.590 --> 01:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
for the for the both of us everything
 
01:22:50.910 --> 01:22:50.920 align:start position:0%
that they had in my case plan I had
 
01:22:52.669 --> 01:22:52.679 align:start position:0%
already been doing and and case worker
 
01:22:54.510 --> 01:22:54.520 align:start position:0%
knew it coming to my house he had
 
01:22:56.950 --> 01:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
already known that I was in all those
 
01:23:00.430 --> 01:23:00.440 align:start position:0%
things and um he didn't call anybody he
 
01:23:02.629 --> 01:23:02.639 align:start position:0%
didn't call any one of them
 
01:23:06.790 --> 01:23:06.800 align:start position:0%
and the judge granted um the EXP parte
 
01:23:08.950 --> 01:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
now in that X parte you know they they
 
01:23:11.990 --> 01:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
Supply an affidavit and in that
 
01:23:16.629 --> 01:23:16.639 align:start position:0%
affidavit um there were 11 statements
 
01:23:19.750 --> 01:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
and eight of them were not factual and I
 
01:23:22.430 --> 01:23:22.440 align:start position:0%
could prove in black and white video
 
01:23:27.070 --> 01:23:27.080 align:start position:0%
hardcore that six so two are like but
 
01:23:29.310 --> 01:23:29.320 align:start position:0%
six of them black and white hardcore
 
01:23:31.629 --> 01:23:31.639 align:start position:0%
video I brought it to the courtroom
 
01:23:34.870 --> 01:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
brought the video footage he said that I
 
01:23:37.149 --> 01:23:37.159 align:start position:0%
looked and acted a certain way he said
 
01:23:38.709 --> 01:23:38.719 align:start position:0%
that my son took off three times during
 
01:23:41.870 --> 01:23:41.880 align:start position:0%
the visit he said all sorts of things
 
01:23:44.390 --> 01:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
that in this affidavit that got the EXP
 
01:23:52.310 --> 01:23:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:55.229 --> 01:23:55.239 align:start position:0%
factual I thank you you for sharing this
 
01:23:56.629 --> 01:23:56.639 align:start position:0%
with us and trusting us with this
 
01:23:58.270 --> 01:23:58.280 align:start position:0%
information I'm so sorry that you've
 
01:24:00.910 --> 01:24:00.920 align:start position:0%
gone through this and with this process
 
01:24:03.510 --> 01:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
um so with that it was because your son
 
01:24:06.270 --> 01:24:06.280 align:start position:0%
was running around going to the sand pit
 
01:24:08.350 --> 01:24:08.360 align:start position:0%
and playing on your property and the
 
01:24:10.189 --> 01:24:10.199 align:start position:0%
property adjacent to it that was the
 
01:24:12.629 --> 01:24:12.639 align:start position:0%
reason why they came for that yes and
 
01:24:14.189 --> 01:24:14.199 align:start position:0%
because there had
 
01:24:18.310 --> 01:24:18.320 align:start position:0%
been the guardianship was
 
01:24:22.310 --> 01:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
was generated by my my family who I had
 
01:24:24.590 --> 01:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
been arranged from and they we were not
 
01:24:27.629 --> 01:24:27.639 align:start position:0%
we were not um familiar with each other
 
01:24:30.669 --> 01:24:30.679 align:start position:0%
andth less I've been in sobriety for at
 
01:24:34.030 --> 01:24:34.040 align:start position:0%
that time eight years and um in a in a
 
01:24:35.990 --> 01:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
treatment program but my family didn't
 
01:24:38.910 --> 01:24:38.920 align:start position:0%
know anything about me being a mom in
 
01:24:41.030 --> 01:24:41.040 align:start position:0%
sobriety didn't know me they didn't know
 
01:24:43.229 --> 01:24:43.239 align:start position:0%
anything about me period at that
 
01:24:45.990 --> 01:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
time so there was
 
01:24:48.830 --> 01:24:48.840 align:start position:0%
some allegations in history of substance
 
01:24:51.149 --> 01:24:51.159 align:start position:0%
use which it was included in this
 
01:24:52.910 --> 01:24:52.920 align:start position:0%
affidavit he said that he saw
 
01:24:55.350 --> 01:24:55.360 align:start position:0%
paraphernalia which we were able to
 
01:24:57.030 --> 01:24:57.040 align:start position:0%
prove in black and white video footage
 
01:24:59.470 --> 01:24:59.480 align:start position:0%
that he did not see paraphernalia in my
 
01:25:02.390 --> 01:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
home the substance use part of my case
 
01:25:04.950 --> 01:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
was dropped I won that part for proving
 
01:25:07.709 --> 01:25:07.719 align:start position:0%
that the case worker lied in you know to
 
01:25:11.390 --> 01:25:11.400 align:start position:0%
the court yet he's still employed
 
01:25:15.750 --> 01:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
and um yeah so there so there's there's
 
01:25:17.709 --> 01:25:17.719 align:start position:0%
more so so there's more to there's that
 
01:25:21.390 --> 01:25:21.400 align:start position:0%
part however I I did win that part the
 
01:25:23.709 --> 01:25:23.719 align:start position:0%
substance use part and I continued to go
 
01:25:27.109 --> 01:25:27.119 align:start position:0%
on random UA throughout their case plan
 
01:25:29.830 --> 01:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
with me and
 
01:25:34.070 --> 01:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
uh the tribunal you know the tribunal
 
01:25:36.750 --> 01:25:36.760 align:start position:0%
court that they have uh my judge is
 
01:25:39.950 --> 01:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
there's no way that he could be unbiased
 
01:25:42.709 --> 01:25:42.719 align:start position:0%
so he let me so just more to the facts
 
01:25:44.950 --> 01:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
about it as opposed to saying that about
 
01:25:48.229 --> 01:25:48.239 align:start position:0%
so there's more so the facts are that it
 
01:25:50.350 --> 01:25:50.360 align:start position:0%
remains in a court in the same court
 
01:25:54.310 --> 01:25:54.320 align:start position:0%
that had heard my 3 n 369 and 12mth
 
01:25:57.830 --> 01:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
hearing is the same judge who hears your
 
01:26:00.470 --> 01:26:00.480 align:start position:0%
termination of parental rights
 
01:26:03.910 --> 01:26:03.920 align:start position:0%
hearing so there's no way that there
 
01:26:07.350 --> 01:26:07.360 align:start position:0%
can't be a bias there um yeah but we're
 
01:26:09.470 --> 01:26:09.480 align:start position:0%
here today to talk about Jew process and
 
01:26:12.070 --> 01:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
and and that affidavit that he provided
 
01:26:15.310 --> 01:26:15.320 align:start position:0%
was not factual and I proved it in court
 
01:26:20.350 --> 01:26:20.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:23.070 --> 01:26:23.080 align:start position:0%
continued I'm I'm so sorry for what's
 
01:26:24.830 --> 01:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
happened with you and your son
 
01:26:26.189 --> 01:26:26.199 align:start position:0%
um thank you for sharing that
 
01:26:27.709 --> 01:26:27.719 align:start position:0%
information we need to find out what
 
01:26:30.470 --> 01:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
happens when an affidavit has um things
 
01:26:32.709 --> 01:26:32.719 align:start position:0%
that are proven to not be true and to
 
01:26:34.229 --> 01:26:34.239 align:start position:0%
figure out how that's handled within the
 
01:26:37.510 --> 01:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
department and um what and what that
 
01:26:39.750 --> 01:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
process is because we need to understand
 
01:26:41.750 --> 01:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
how that's handled and as far as due
 
01:26:43.629 --> 01:26:43.639 align:start position:0%
process it sounds like you believe that
 
01:26:45.750 --> 01:26:45.760 align:start position:0%
having the termination of parenting
 
01:26:48.390 --> 01:26:48.400 align:start position:0%
heard by a different judge than the one
 
01:26:51.510 --> 01:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
who hears your um ongoing ones for the
 
01:26:53.470 --> 01:26:53.480 align:start position:0%
thing would would give you a better
 
01:26:54.790 --> 01:26:54.800 align:start position:0%
better feeling that there was due
 
01:26:56.109 --> 01:26:56.119 align:start position:0%
process because it would be a different
 
01:26:57.830 --> 01:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
judge no I think it would be better if
 
01:27:01.229 --> 01:27:01.239 align:start position:0%
there was a jury of my peers if it was
 
01:27:01.239 --> 01:27:03.830 align:start position:0%
there was a jury of my peers if it was
due

01:27:03.830 --> 01:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:07.030 --> 01:27:07.040 align:start position:0%
process that thank you that that I I
 
01:27:08.709 --> 01:27:08.719 align:start position:0%
definitely understand to that point
 
01:27:10.149 --> 01:27:10.159 align:start position:0%
because having a jury of your peers
 
01:27:12.149 --> 01:27:12.159 align:start position:0%
looking at termination of parenting I
 
01:27:13.390 --> 01:27:13.400 align:start position:0%
can understand that perspective that
 
01:27:16.470 --> 01:27:16.480 align:start position:0%
makes a lot of sense um so um sorry
 
01:27:16.480 --> 01:27:17.669 align:start position:0%
makes a lot of sense um so um sorry
representative

01:27:17.669 --> 01:27:17.679 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:27:19.669 --> 01:27:19.679 align:start position:0%
kofalt thank you madam chair and thank
 
01:27:21.470 --> 01:27:21.480 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question so you
 
01:27:24.550 --> 01:27:24.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned um exculpatory evidence you
 
01:27:27.030 --> 01:27:27.040 align:start position:0%
had on video did you have a full
 
01:27:29.270 --> 01:27:29.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity to present that evidence in
 
01:27:32.510 --> 01:27:32.520 align:start position:0%
court yes okay and which is why we why I
 
01:27:36.030 --> 01:27:36.040 align:start position:0%
won the substance part of the case but
 
01:27:39.590 --> 01:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:41.669 --> 01:27:41.679 align:start position:0%
unsupervised today that you know he'
 
01:27:42.990 --> 01:27:43.000 align:start position:0%
gotten his bike he learned to ride of
 
01:27:44.669 --> 01:27:44.679 align:start position:0%
that day and and that these are the
 
01:27:46.109 --> 01:27:46.119 align:start position:0%
things that happen yes those things
 
01:27:50.430 --> 01:27:50.440 align:start position:0%
happen Okay follow followup um would you
 
01:27:53.470 --> 01:27:53.480 align:start position:0%
believe that we have a a bill that the
 
01:27:55.550 --> 01:27:55.560 align:start position:0%
house passed earlier this
 
01:28:00.070 --> 01:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
year I believe it's House Bill
 
01:28:03.830 --> 01:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
1012 would establish
 
01:28:06.590 --> 01:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
that when parents allow children to take
 
01:28:08.350 --> 01:28:08.360 align:start position:0%
reasonable risks to further their
 
01:28:10.990 --> 01:28:11.000 align:start position:0%
development as independent human beings
 
01:28:13.629 --> 01:28:13.639 align:start position:0%
that that would not be a violation of
 
01:28:15.910 --> 01:28:15.920 align:start position:0%
our child welfare statutes I do follow
 
01:28:18.109 --> 01:28:18.119 align:start position:0%
and I am familiar and I'm happy
 
01:28:20.030 --> 01:28:20.040 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that that too is going to
 
01:28:21.470 --> 01:28:21.480 align:start position:0%
the senate floor on Thursday and it
 
01:28:22.830 --> 01:28:22.840 align:start position:0%
looks like it's going to go to interim
 
01:28:25.430 --> 01:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
study but I just wanted to find out if
 
01:28:27.270 --> 01:28:27.280 align:start position:0%
you're aware of that thank
 
01:28:29.470 --> 01:28:29.480 align:start position:0%
you thank
 
01:28:33.950 --> 01:28:33.960 align:start position:0%
you um so thank you so much for sharing
 
01:28:36.390 --> 01:28:36.400 align:start position:0%
that I I I hope that
 
01:28:38.510 --> 01:28:38.520 align:start position:0%
um I don't have any words that I can
 
01:28:40.510 --> 01:28:40.520 align:start position:0%
offer you but just let us let you know
 
01:28:48.109 --> 01:28:48.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:51.109 --> 01:28:51.119 align:start position:0%
sharing um next Eric Blair are you ready
 
01:28:52.470 --> 01:28:52.480 align:start position:0%
to come or do you want to let somebody
 
01:28:54.470 --> 01:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
else come first
 
01:28:59.390 --> 01:28:59.400 align:start position:0%
okay okay um uh Chris
 
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
noise said 10 minutes I know you've been
 
01:29:03.709 --> 01:29:03.719 align:start position:0%
up before so I'll let the timer will let
 
01:29:05.510 --> 01:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
you know when 10 minutes is here and if
 
01:29:07.350 --> 01:29:07.360 align:start position:0%
um if you can keep it a little shorter
 
01:29:09.189 --> 01:29:09.199 align:start position:0%
than that I we have several people that
 
01:29:11.149 --> 01:29:11.159 align:start position:0%
leave need to leave at noon so I want to
 
01:29:12.590 --> 01:29:12.600 align:start position:0%
make sure that everybody can be heard if
 
01:29:13.990 --> 01:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
you can maybe keep that to maybe seven
 
01:29:16.350 --> 01:29:16.360 align:start position:0%
minutes or so to my name is Chris noise
 
01:29:18.550 --> 01:29:18.560 align:start position:0%
um I'm an inhabitant of State of New
 
01:29:21.470 --> 01:29:21.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire currently living in Bethlehem
 
01:29:23.109 --> 01:29:23.119 align:start position:0%
and one thing I wanted to add about Anna
 
01:29:24.790 --> 01:29:24.800 align:start position:0%
Marie's case cuz she been talking to me
 
01:29:26.709 --> 01:29:26.719 align:start position:0%
about is that there was a there's an
 
01:29:28.189 --> 01:29:28.199 align:start position:0%
also an affidavit that she didn't
 
01:29:31.149 --> 01:29:31.159 align:start position:0%
mention today which was placed by the
 
01:29:35.109 --> 01:29:35.119 align:start position:0%
DCF worker which was clearly hearsay the
 
01:29:38.070 --> 01:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
dcyf worker wrote an affidavit stating
 
01:29:41.510 --> 01:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
that the neighbor saw the child doing
 
01:29:43.350 --> 01:29:43.360 align:start position:0%
something or other that in and of itself
 
01:29:45.149 --> 01:29:45.159 align:start position:0%
disqualifies an affidavit affidavit has
 
01:29:48.709 --> 01:29:48.719 align:start position:0%
to be firsthand knowledge so if dcyf
 
01:29:52.229 --> 01:29:52.239 align:start position:0%
workers are in the practice of serving
 
01:29:55.229 --> 01:29:55.239 align:start position:0%
secondhand hearsay
 
01:29:57.109 --> 01:29:57.119 align:start position:0%
affidavits that should let everybody
 
01:29:58.310 --> 01:29:58.320 align:start position:0%
know right off the bat that there's
 
01:30:01.390 --> 01:30:01.400 align:start position:0%
problems and her child winds up being
 
01:30:03.910 --> 01:30:03.920 align:start position:0%
taken um after the end of a process that
 
01:30:06.950 --> 01:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
started on a hearsay affidavit is all
 
01:30:09.510 --> 01:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
wrong but
 
01:30:11.950 --> 01:30:11.960 align:start position:0%
um I think it's important to talk about
 
01:30:14.830 --> 01:30:14.840 align:start position:0%
right now the impact that the New York
 
01:30:17.709 --> 01:30:17.719 align:start position:0%
pistol and rifle versus Brewing case has
 
01:30:20.830 --> 01:30:20.840 align:start position:0%
had on the way
 
01:30:20.840 --> 01:30:22.350 align:start position:0%
had on the way
courts

01:30:22.350 --> 01:30:22.360 align:start position:0%
courts
 
01:30:26.709 --> 01:30:26.719 align:start position:0%
determine um what a law means so in the
 
01:30:29.070 --> 01:30:29.080 align:start position:0%
New York pistol and rifle case the
 
01:30:32.070 --> 01:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court basically shifted the
 
01:30:32.080 --> 01:30:33.189 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court basically shifted the
Paradigm

01:30:33.189 --> 01:30:33.199 align:start position:0%
Paradigm
 
01:30:35.270 --> 01:30:35.280 align:start position:0%
entirely from the What's called the
 
01:30:38.830 --> 01:30:38.840 align:start position:0%
two-step method um for reviewing um and
 
01:30:40.550 --> 01:30:40.560 align:start position:0%
determining what Allah law means and
 
01:30:42.070 --> 01:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
they shift it to the one-step method and
 
01:30:44.629 --> 01:30:44.639 align:start position:0%
in this method um what they do is they
 
01:30:46.990 --> 01:30:47.000 align:start position:0%
restrict thems combine themselves only
 
01:30:48.590 --> 01:30:48.600 align:start position:0%
to the founding generation's
 
01:30:49.910 --> 01:30:49.920 align:start position:0%
understanding of a law so basically the
 
01:30:52.470 --> 01:30:52.480 align:start position:0%
first 50 years
 
01:30:54.430 --> 01:30:54.440 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:30:57.709 --> 01:30:57.719 align:start position:0%
during that during that time um what we
 
01:30:59.870 --> 01:30:59.880 align:start position:0%
find is that there is no historical
 
01:31:01.590 --> 01:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
tradition during the founding
 
01:31:04.229 --> 01:31:04.239 align:start position:0%
generations for removing children for
 
01:31:07.229 --> 01:31:07.239 align:start position:0%
from a home for going out to play for
 
01:31:09.750 --> 01:31:09.760 align:start position:0%
instance um but more importantly that
 
01:31:12.350 --> 01:31:12.360 align:start position:0%
impacts how you define what true do
 
01:31:14.870 --> 01:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
process is so the definitions that were
 
01:31:17.350 --> 01:31:17.360 align:start position:0%
brought forward today are from middle
 
01:31:19.109 --> 01:31:19.119 align:start position:0%
American Juris Prudence or recent
 
01:31:21.189 --> 01:31:21.199 align:start position:0%
American Juris prudence and like I said
 
01:31:24.590 --> 01:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court has ued that and you
 
01:31:28.350 --> 01:31:28.360 align:start position:0%
can hear the liberal um Supreme Court
 
01:31:29.870 --> 01:31:29.880 align:start position:0%
Justices actually complaining about that
 
01:31:31.750 --> 01:31:31.760 align:start position:0%
in the oral arguments of rahimi versus
 
01:31:34.030 --> 01:31:34.040 align:start position:0%
us where they're saying Are We Now
 
01:31:36.070 --> 01:31:36.080 align:start position:0%
confined to only being able to look at
 
01:31:37.790 --> 01:31:37.800 align:start position:0%
the founding generation's understanding
 
01:31:40.669 --> 01:31:40.679 align:start position:0%
of the written law in order to determine
 
01:31:44.750 --> 01:31:44.760 align:start position:0%
the the ruling in the case and um the
 
01:31:46.390 --> 01:31:46.400 align:start position:0%
the finding was that yes that that's how
 
01:31:49.270 --> 01:31:49.280 align:start position:0%
it goes now for the since uh
 
01:31:54.870 --> 01:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
22 so that basically takes the ACLU
 
01:31:56.430 --> 01:31:56.440 align:start position:0%
definitions of due process that you
 
01:31:57.550 --> 01:31:57.560 align:start position:0%
brought forward now which are from
 
01:32:00.310 --> 01:32:00.320 align:start position:0%
recent history and at a supreme court
 
01:32:01.910 --> 01:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
level those would be tossed out what
 
01:32:03.629 --> 01:32:03.639 align:start position:0%
would be considered the true do process
 
01:32:05.669 --> 01:32:05.679 align:start position:0%
is what Leah kushman has brought forward
 
01:32:07.229 --> 01:32:07.239 align:start position:0%
before she was removed from the
 
01:32:10.830 --> 01:32:10.840 align:start position:0%
committee which is a sworn affidavit has
 
01:32:12.790 --> 01:32:12.800 align:start position:0%
to kick everything off that has to be
 
01:32:16.270 --> 01:32:16.280 align:start position:0%
firsthand uh testimony secondly the
 
01:32:18.270 --> 01:32:18.280 align:start position:0%
person needs to have a true trial by a
 
01:32:19.709 --> 01:32:19.719 align:start position:0%
jury which is different from a jury
 
01:32:20.830 --> 01:32:20.840 align:start position:0%
trial and you should look into the
 
01:32:23.430 --> 01:32:23.440 align:start position:0%
difference and has to move exclusively
 
01:32:25.390 --> 01:32:25.400 align:start position:0%
by the rule Ru of common law no statute
 
01:32:28.590 --> 01:32:28.600 align:start position:0%
can be used that is the true historical
 
01:32:31.030 --> 01:32:31.040 align:start position:0%
tradition of due process in America and
 
01:32:31.990 --> 01:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
that's part of New Hampshire
 
01:32:34.550 --> 01:32:34.560 align:start position:0%
Constitution 115 which you all swore
 
01:32:35.590 --> 01:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
oath to
 
01:32:39.750 --> 01:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
uphold now also as a result of this
 
01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:42.070 align:start position:0%
uphold now also as a result of this

Bruin
 
01:32:44.590 --> 01:32:44.600 align:start position:0%
decision confining courts confining
 
01:32:46.669 --> 01:32:46.679 align:start position:0%
themselves to the founding generation's
 
01:32:50.229 --> 01:32:50.239 align:start position:0%
understanding of how this country
 
01:32:52.310 --> 01:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
operates um I'm going to leave this I'm
 
01:32:56.350 --> 01:32:56.360 align:start position:0%
going to leave some uh evidence for you
 
01:32:58.910 --> 01:32:58.920 align:start position:0%
um but there was a gentleman at the
 
01:33:01.030 --> 01:33:01.040 align:start position:0%
Buffalo law school scholar who did a re
 
01:33:04.149 --> 01:33:04.159 align:start position:0%
who did research on some 15,000
 
01:33:06.109 --> 01:33:06.119 align:start position:0%
documents of all the writings of the
 
01:33:07.950 --> 01:33:07.960 align:start position:0%
framers and Debaters of the
 
01:33:10.550 --> 01:33:10.560 align:start position:0%
Constitutions and what he found was that
 
01:33:12.390 --> 01:33:12.400 align:start position:0%
unanimously every single one of them
 
01:33:14.310 --> 01:33:14.320 align:start position:0%
whether Federalists or Anti-Federalists
 
01:33:16.750 --> 01:33:16.760 align:start position:0%
believed that the Constitutions were
 
01:33:20.510 --> 01:33:20.520 align:start position:0%
public trusts and they said that the the
 
01:33:24.109 --> 01:33:24.119 align:start position:0%
fiduciary duty of the trustees um who
 
01:33:26.149 --> 01:33:26.159 align:start position:0%
swear oath to these public trusts the
 
01:33:28.149 --> 01:33:28.159 align:start position:0%
penalty for violate for breaching trust
 
01:33:33.189 --> 01:33:33.199 align:start position:0%
should be more severe than those uh the
 
01:33:35.590 --> 01:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
counterpart breaches and remedies
 
01:33:38.470 --> 01:33:38.480 align:start position:0%
available or sorry remedies and
 
01:33:40.669 --> 01:33:40.679 align:start position:0%
punishments available to the people in
 
01:33:43.229 --> 01:33:43.239 align:start position:0%
private trust so in private trust what's
 
01:33:45.430 --> 01:33:45.440 align:start position:0%
available to the people is for trustees
 
01:33:46.910 --> 01:33:46.920 align:start position:0%
who breach is
 
01:33:46.920 --> 01:33:48.470 align:start position:0%
who breach is
litigation

01:33:48.470 --> 01:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
litigation
 
01:33:51.750 --> 01:33:51.760 align:start position:0%
arbitration firing and so on well in the
 
01:33:53.430 --> 01:33:53.440 align:start position:0%
public trust they added to those those
 
01:33:55.030 --> 01:33:55.040 align:start position:0%
were the bare minimum because they said
 
01:33:56.830 --> 01:33:56.840 align:start position:0%
the public trust breach should be more
 
01:33:58.470 --> 01:33:58.480 align:start position:0%
severe than the private trust so they
 
01:34:01.350 --> 01:34:01.360 align:start position:0%
added to those impeachments so on and so
 
01:34:03.070 --> 01:34:03.080 align:start position:0%
forth but they never did away with the
 
01:34:06.550 --> 01:34:06.560 align:start position:0%
litigation arbitration and so on and
 
01:34:09.550 --> 01:34:09.560 align:start position:0%
so just like the people the uh just like
 
01:34:13.070 --> 01:34:13.080 align:start position:0%
the um dcys has to follow due process
 
01:34:15.109 --> 01:34:15.119 align:start position:0%
when the people are planning to
 
01:34:17.629 --> 01:34:17.639 align:start position:0%
arbitrate or litigate their trustees
 
01:34:19.109 --> 01:34:19.119 align:start position:0%
they need to follow due process and one
 
01:34:20.470 --> 01:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
of the things they do is they provide
 
01:34:22.350 --> 01:34:22.360 align:start position:0%
notice that's the first step is the
 
01:34:24.870 --> 01:34:24.880 align:start position:0%
people provide notice to their trust es
 
01:34:27.270 --> 01:34:27.280 align:start position:0%
alleging that they are acting outside
 
01:34:29.310 --> 01:34:29.320 align:start position:0%
the trust so on and so forth and we give
 
01:34:31.229 --> 01:34:31.239 align:start position:0%
the trustees an opportunity to respond
 
01:34:33.750 --> 01:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
we've sent you all notices here and I
 
01:34:35.430 --> 01:34:35.440 align:start position:0%
think Sandy responded to one of them but
 
01:34:36.669 --> 01:34:36.679 align:start position:0%
I don't think we've gotten responses
 
01:34:39.470 --> 01:34:39.480 align:start position:0%
from the rest of you after that we will
 
01:34:42.590 --> 01:34:42.600 align:start position:0%
proceed to giving an affidavit just like
 
01:34:44.390 --> 01:34:44.400 align:start position:0%
due process just like the government has
 
01:34:45.870 --> 01:34:45.880 align:start position:0%
to provide due process we'll provide you
 
01:34:48.510 --> 01:34:48.520 align:start position:0%
due process and we'll we'll give you
 
01:34:51.430 --> 01:34:51.440 align:start position:0%
affidavits testifying to whether or not
 
01:34:54.870 --> 01:34:54.880 align:start position:0%
you have responded to our awful
 
01:34:54.880 --> 01:34:56.430 align:start position:0%
you have responded to our awful
notices

01:34:56.430 --> 01:34:56.440 align:start position:0%
notices
 
01:34:59.270 --> 01:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
now um a unrebutted
 
01:35:01.669 --> 01:35:01.679 align:start position:0%
affidavits and uncontroverted affidavits
 
01:35:03.310 --> 01:35:03.320 align:start position:0%
must be accepted as Truth by courts and
 
01:35:04.590 --> 01:35:04.600 align:start position:0%
I can I'm going to leave you with four
 
01:35:06.870 --> 01:35:06.880 align:start position:0%
court cases proving that an unre
 
01:35:08.790 --> 01:35:08.800 align:start position:0%
unrebutted affidavit uncontroverted
 
01:35:11.790 --> 01:35:11.800 align:start position:0%
affidavit must be accepted as true so
 
01:35:13.590 --> 01:35:13.600 align:start position:0%
that brings me to the fact that we sent
 
01:35:16.310 --> 01:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
notice to DCF back in October telling
 
01:35:18.590 --> 01:35:18.600 align:start position:0%
them to produce evidence that they give
 
01:35:21.470 --> 01:35:21.480 align:start position:0%
true do process to the people the New
 
01:35:23.990 --> 01:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire 115 style that Leah Kush has
 
01:35:25.470 --> 01:35:25.480 align:start position:0%
put on the record here so plausible
 
01:35:27.390 --> 01:35:27.400 align:start position:0%
deniability has been
 
01:35:30.030 --> 01:35:30.040 align:start position:0%
removed demanding them to produce
 
01:35:32.109 --> 01:35:32.119 align:start position:0%
evidence that they have given this true
 
01:35:33.990 --> 01:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
do process to anyone that they have put
 
01:35:37.430 --> 01:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
on a child endangerment list or uh
 
01:35:38.870 --> 01:35:38.880 align:start position:0%
terminated parental rights and so on and
 
01:35:41.390 --> 01:35:41.400 align:start position:0%
so forth we instructed Leah kushman in
 
01:35:43.030 --> 01:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
that notice to follow up with them if
 
01:35:45.270 --> 01:35:45.280 align:start position:0%
they if they refuseed to respond to
 
01:35:47.910 --> 01:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
further investigate the matter she did
 
01:35:50.590 --> 01:35:50.600 align:start position:0%
that and the
 
01:35:53.350 --> 01:35:53.360 align:start position:0%
DCF uh attorney basically responded
 
01:35:55.790 --> 01:35:55.800 align:start position:0%
saying sarily we are within
 
01:35:58.629 --> 01:35:58.639 align:start position:0%
constitutional due process well I I hope
 
01:36:00.109 --> 01:36:00.119 align:start position:0%
that you can all see and agree that a
 
01:36:02.550 --> 01:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
court of law whether it be arbitration
 
01:36:05.470 --> 01:36:05.480 align:start position:0%
or a conventional Court I don't believe
 
01:36:07.990 --> 01:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
the judge is going to accept a summary
 
01:36:10.270 --> 01:36:10.280 align:start position:0%
statement from an attorney as sufficient
 
01:36:12.189 --> 01:36:12.199 align:start position:0%
and substit evidence to overcome and
 
01:36:14.109 --> 01:36:14.119 align:start position:0%
controvert the claims made in the
 
01:36:16.510 --> 01:36:16.520 align:start position:0%
notices now this week several several
 
01:36:18.550 --> 01:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
people here and and all the further all
 
01:36:20.070 --> 01:36:20.080 align:start position:0%
the previous testimonies have sent
 
01:36:24.270 --> 01:36:24.280 align:start position:0%
affidavits into DCF and uh we sent
 
01:36:26.430 --> 01:36:26.440 align:start position:0%
affidavits into DCF this week following
 
01:36:29.750 --> 01:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
up on their refusal to provide evidence
 
01:36:32.070 --> 01:36:32.080 align:start position:0%
so when they fail to rebut or produce
 
01:36:34.870 --> 01:36:34.880 align:start position:0%
evidence to show you guys that they're
 
01:36:36.590 --> 01:36:36.600 align:start position:0%
giving the true constitutional due
 
01:36:39.149 --> 01:36:39.159 align:start position:0%
process not ACLU definition the founding
 
01:36:41.870 --> 01:36:41.880 align:start position:0%
Generations definition when they fail to
 
01:36:44.550 --> 01:36:44.560 align:start position:0%
do that then you must take those
 
01:36:46.510 --> 01:36:46.520 align:start position:0%
uncontroverted affidavits as true and
 
01:36:49.790 --> 01:36:49.800 align:start position:0%
you must assume that they are not giving
 
01:36:51.950 --> 01:36:51.960 align:start position:0%
true constitutional due process which is
 
01:36:54.709 --> 01:36:54.719 align:start position:0%
a trial by jury jury of your peers where
 
01:36:56.990 --> 01:36:57.000 align:start position:0%
the jury gets to hear the facts and the
 
01:36:59.270 --> 01:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
law because in a jury trial the jury
 
01:37:01.030 --> 01:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
only hears the facts and then they're
 
01:37:03.030 --> 01:37:03.040 align:start position:0%
instructed by the judge to follow the
 
01:37:05.470 --> 01:37:05.480 align:start position:0%
penalty prescribed in the statute as
 
01:37:07.070 --> 01:37:07.080 align:start position:0%
Leah pointed out the statute is not the
 
01:37:09.149 --> 01:37:09.159 align:start position:0%
law of the land because the statute must
 
01:37:11.189 --> 01:37:11.199 align:start position:0%
hear before it condemns statute gives
 
01:37:13.109 --> 01:37:13.119 align:start position:0%
penalty inside the statute itself so
 
01:37:15.750 --> 01:37:15.760 align:start position:0%
that cannot be the law of the land the
 
01:37:17.550 --> 01:37:17.560 align:start position:0%
the people have to be given a trial by
 
01:37:19.030 --> 01:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
jury of their peers where the jury will
 
01:37:21.470 --> 01:37:21.480 align:start position:0%
hear the facts and the law and they get
 
01:37:23.910 --> 01:37:23.920 align:start position:0%
to determine or nullify the law actually
 
01:37:26.310 --> 01:37:26.320 align:start position:0%
if they don't think it's a good law
 
01:37:27.950 --> 01:37:27.960 align:start position:0%
until the people get that and they can
 
01:37:29.750 --> 01:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
prove it so what you guys have to do
 
01:37:30.830 --> 01:37:30.840 align:start position:0%
what we're giving you lawful
 
01:37:32.830 --> 01:37:32.840 align:start position:0%
instructions to do today is we want you
 
01:37:35.830 --> 01:37:35.840 align:start position:0%
to send notice to the DCF and say
 
01:37:37.910 --> 01:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
respond to the people give them the last
 
01:37:39.310 --> 01:37:39.320 align:start position:0%
six months cases they can give them to
 
01:37:41.709 --> 01:37:41.719 align:start position:0%
you they can redact those personal
 
01:37:44.270 --> 01:37:44.280 align:start position:0%
information names and addresses that's
 
01:37:46.790 --> 01:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
sensitive but you have to take a look at
 
01:37:49.430 --> 01:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
the process they're using and determine
 
01:37:50.750 --> 01:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
whether they are giving the founding
 
01:37:52.709 --> 01:37:52.719 align:start position:0%
Generations understanding of true du
 
01:37:55.669 --> 01:37:55.679 align:start position:0%
process before they ruin someone
 
01:37:56.990 --> 01:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
reputation by putting them on a child
 
01:37:59.109 --> 01:37:59.119 align:start position:0%
endangerment list before they take
 
01:38:02.350 --> 01:38:02.360 align:start position:0%
children before they take money and
 
01:38:04.629 --> 01:38:04.639 align:start position:0%
payment plan uh parenting plans all
 
01:38:06.669 --> 01:38:06.679 align:start position:0%
those kind of things anytime they do
 
01:38:07.790 --> 01:38:07.800 align:start position:0%
those things and they haven't given a
 
01:38:10.070 --> 01:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
jury a trial by jury moving by rule of
 
01:38:11.390 --> 01:38:11.400 align:start position:0%
common law no
 
01:38:13.950 --> 01:38:13.960 align:start position:0%
statute then they're violating the
 
01:38:17.149 --> 01:38:17.159 align:start position:0%
Constitutional due process of the people
 
01:38:19.390 --> 01:38:19.400 align:start position:0%
and that is an agency that was created
 
01:38:22.030 --> 01:38:22.040 align:start position:0%
by the legislature so you have the
 
01:38:24.470 --> 01:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
authority and the responsibility to put
 
01:38:26.709 --> 01:38:26.719 align:start position:0%
a check on it to put a stop on it we
 
01:38:27.990 --> 01:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
want you to tell them if they don't
 
01:38:31.350 --> 01:38:31.360 align:start position:0%
produce this kind of evidence um then
 
01:38:34.510 --> 01:38:34.520 align:start position:0%
you want to you want all the children
 
01:38:36.870 --> 01:38:36.880 align:start position:0%
families reunited uh you have the
 
01:38:38.950 --> 01:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
authority to give Financial reparations
 
01:38:40.430 --> 01:38:40.440 align:start position:0%
that's also in the historical tradition
 
01:38:41.510 --> 01:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
and we can prove it that you can give
 
01:38:42.990 --> 01:38:43.000 align:start position:0%
Financial reparations to the families
 
01:38:46.709 --> 01:38:46.719 align:start position:0%
that were harmed um we want you to take
 
01:38:49.390 --> 01:38:49.400 align:start position:0%
PE people name off of a child
 
01:38:51.830 --> 01:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
endangerment list all these people who
 
01:38:53.870 --> 01:38:53.880 align:start position:0%
have been railroaded by this this entire
 
01:38:55.589 --> 01:38:55.599 align:start position:0%
system that does not give due process
 
01:38:57.830 --> 01:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
right from the start you guys are the
 
01:38:59.030 --> 01:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
ones that are on the hook the
 
01:39:00.470 --> 01:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
responsibility to fix it because you
 
01:39:02.589 --> 01:39:02.599 align:start position:0%
created that agency you have authority
 
01:39:04.189 --> 01:39:04.199 align:start position:0%
over that agency it's your
 
01:39:05.990 --> 01:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
responsibility and your plausible
 
01:39:07.790 --> 01:39:07.800 align:start position:0%
deniability is gone because we put it
 
01:39:09.350 --> 01:39:09.360 align:start position:0%
all out
 
01:39:12.709 --> 01:39:12.719 align:start position:0%

talk to the protected party and then
there's

01:40:34.669 --> 01:40:34.679 align:start position:0%
there's
 
01:40:37.189 --> 01:40:37.199 align:start position:0%
orders which are
 
01:40:40.390 --> 01:40:40.400 align:start position:0%
lawful even though 173b protective
 
01:40:42.910 --> 01:40:42.920 align:start position:0%
orders are unconstitutional that says
 
01:40:45.830 --> 01:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
that the police must arrest me if I
 
01:40:47.790 --> 01:40:47.800 align:start position:0%
communicate and they've help the court
 
01:40:49.830 --> 01:40:49.840 align:start position:0%
has held me into contempt um I'm going
 
01:40:52.870 --> 01:40:52.880 align:start position:0%
to start out with I was listening to the
 
01:40:55.109 --> 01:40:55.119 align:start position:0%
committee and I appreciate all your time
 
01:40:56.550 --> 01:40:56.560 align:start position:0%
um it's not your fault that this has
 
01:40:59.109 --> 01:40:59.119 align:start position:0%
happened you have a decision what to do
 
01:41:01.470 --> 01:41:01.480 align:start position:0%
today based on this information
 
01:41:03.430 --> 01:41:03.440 align:start position:0%
including what the gentleman just said
 
01:41:06.470 --> 01:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
which I agree in part a lot with and I
 
01:41:09.550 --> 01:41:09.560 align:start position:0%
have uh things to back that up but what
 
01:41:12.669 --> 01:41:12.679 align:start position:0%
you guys were talking about um you
 
01:41:14.990 --> 01:41:15.000 align:start position:0%
talking about the courts so rule 38 of
 
01:41:18.109 --> 01:41:18.119 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court is uh judicial conduct
 
01:41:19.430 --> 01:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
you're going to want to look at that
 
01:41:23.629 --> 01:41:23.639 align:start position:0%
because a judge has a duty to report
 
01:41:27.830 --> 01:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
judici uh judicial misconduct and also
 
01:41:29.229 --> 01:41:29.239 align:start position:0%
professional misconduct which is for
 
01:41:31.430 --> 01:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
lawyers and lawyers have a duty to
 
01:41:36.950 --> 01:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
report judges and also the 0311 colon 6
 
01:41:38.870 --> 01:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
where it under Pains of penalty of
 
01:41:41.030 --> 01:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
perjury to get their license they swear
 
01:41:43.030 --> 01:41:43.040 align:start position:0%
before The Supreme Court that they will
 
01:41:45.629 --> 01:41:45.639 align:start position:0%
correct anything that is
 
01:41:48.390 --> 01:41:48.400 align:start position:0%
incorrect and uh will not take any case
 
01:41:51.830 --> 01:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
for lucer which is money and and so on
 
01:41:53.830 --> 01:41:53.840 align:start position:0%
when someone has a lawyer they become a
 
01:41:56.149 --> 01:41:56.159 align:start position:0%
ward of the court that means they're
 
01:41:59.390 --> 01:41:59.400 align:start position:0%
incapable of uh representing themselves
 
01:42:02.109 --> 01:42:02.119 align:start position:0%
and then the court uh laer is an officer
 
01:42:05.669 --> 01:42:05.679 align:start position:0%
of the court so the the unknown secret
 
01:42:08.830 --> 01:42:08.840 align:start position:0%
is that judges don't report on judges
 
01:42:11.189 --> 01:42:11.199 align:start position:0%
and or or lawyers and lawyers don't
 
01:42:14.790 --> 01:42:14.800 align:start position:0%
report on judges and that's what we have
 
01:42:17.629 --> 01:42:17.639 align:start position:0%
our entire system respectfully in the
 
01:42:19.709 --> 01:42:19.719 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire is corrupt all
 
01:42:22.310 --> 01:42:22.320 align:start position:0%
the way up to the Supreme Court um and
 
01:42:23.790 --> 01:42:23.800 align:start position:0%
that's where we're getting to the point
 
01:42:26.870 --> 01:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
of impeachment and specific facts on
 
01:42:30.669 --> 01:42:30.679 align:start position:0%
Friday I have a uh order which has from
 
01:42:33.350 --> 01:42:33.360 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court they're hiding the
 
01:42:37.030 --> 01:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
fraud uh that's taking place in court
 
01:42:39.950 --> 01:42:39.960 align:start position:0%
um judges have no discretion when it
 
01:42:42.669 --> 01:42:42.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:46.550 --> 01:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
law uh you guys have the right to
 
01:42:48.550 --> 01:42:48.560 align:start position:0%
impeach the house has the right to
 
01:42:51.750 --> 01:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
impeach and uh the duty to I would
 
01:42:55.030 --> 01:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
assert and then it goes the Senate um
 
01:42:57.629 --> 01:42:57.639 align:start position:0%
when they're not acting within the
 
01:42:59.790 --> 01:42:59.800 align:start position:0%
Constitution the governor knows about
 
01:43:02.830 --> 01:43:02.840 align:start position:0%
this Governor shonu um and his entire
 
01:43:04.709 --> 01:43:04.719 align:start position:0%
administration every single Supreme
 
01:43:07.629 --> 01:43:07.639 align:start position:0%
Court Justice if I'm not mistaken has
 
01:43:10.229 --> 01:43:10.239 align:start position:0%
been appointed by Governor including
 
01:43:13.149 --> 01:43:13.159 align:start position:0%
Gordon McDonald which was sorry can we
 
01:43:16.629 --> 01:43:16.639 align:start position:0%
not get into names please we're event
 
01:43:18.149 --> 01:43:18.159 align:start position:0%
say the current one uh we're talking
 
01:43:19.750 --> 01:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
about the policies not the people so if
 
01:43:20.950 --> 01:43:20.960 align:start position:0%
you can say the current one and just
 
01:43:23.510 --> 01:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
speak to it that way
 
01:43:26.669 --> 01:43:26.679 align:start position:0%
well the only I'm coming here cuz I'm in
 
01:43:29.669 --> 01:43:29.679 align:start position:0%
fear I have no other recourse what do
 
01:43:32.430 --> 01:43:32.440 align:start position:0%
you do when the Supreme Court hides
 
01:43:36.430 --> 01:43:36.440 align:start position:0%
fraud knowing fraud and writes
 
01:43:39.470 --> 01:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
bogus orders that violate the federal
 
01:43:41.350 --> 01:43:41.360 align:start position:0%
rules of civil
 
01:43:45.910 --> 01:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
procedure they've stricken my briefs so
 
01:43:47.430 --> 01:43:47.440 align:start position:0%
I've given I think it's Federal rule of
 
01:43:51.229 --> 01:43:51.239 align:start position:0%
civil procedure on striking uh on uh
 
01:43:53.510 --> 01:43:53.520 align:start position:0%

01:43:57.030 --> 01:43:57.040 align:start position:0%
course uh it you have 21 days for
 
01:43:59.790 --> 01:43:59.800 align:start position:0%
responsive pleading amended it's a
 
01:44:01.229 --> 01:44:01.239 align:start position:0%
matter of course meaning you're allowed
 
01:44:04.189 --> 01:44:04.199 align:start position:0%
to do that they're hiding it and because
 
01:44:06.470 --> 01:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
we don't want to say names because you
 
01:44:08.790 --> 01:44:08.800 align:start position:0%

developing training blah blah blah blah
 
01:45:01.350 --> 01:45:01.360 align:start position:0%
blah point of order Madam chairman yeah
 
01:45:03.030 --> 01:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
point w State your point of order thank
 
01:45:04.510 --> 01:45:04.520 align:start position:0%
you thank you for suspending for a
 
01:45:07.870 --> 01:45:07.880 align:start position:0%
minute um we are hearing specifically
 
01:45:11.790 --> 01:45:11.800 align:start position:0%
DCF matters so I'm wondering if we are
 
01:45:11.800 --> 01:45:12.910 align:start position:0%
DCF matters so I'm wondering if we are
not

01:45:12.910 --> 01:45:12.920 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:45:16.589 --> 01:45:16.599 align:start position:0%
straying a fair ways away from dcyf
 
01:45:20.669 --> 01:45:20.679 align:start position:0%
matters and I'm hoping that um if there
 
01:45:23.950 --> 01:45:23.960 align:start position:0%
if DCF is involved in in these cases
 
01:45:26.350 --> 01:45:26.360 align:start position:0%
which I'm I'm not clear about you will
 
01:45:30.229 --> 01:45:30.239 align:start position:0%
explain to us how DCF is involved rather
 
01:45:33.430 --> 01:45:33.440 align:start position:0%
than uh what sounds like a broader
 
01:45:35.030 --> 01:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
issues that you have with the court
 
01:45:36.990 --> 01:45:37.000 align:start position:0%
system so thank you um thank you for
 
01:45:38.950 --> 01:45:38.960 align:start position:0%
that point of order I agree it's it's
 
01:45:40.229 --> 01:45:40.239 align:start position:0%
hard to understand how to make that
 
01:45:42.990 --> 01:45:43.000 align:start position:0%
actionable since our charge is DCF if
 
01:45:44.470 --> 01:45:44.480 align:start position:0%
you could get to the relationship with
 
01:45:46.550 --> 01:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
DCF that would help us to be able to
 
01:45:48.310 --> 01:45:48.320 align:start position:0%
potentially do something to help you
 
01:45:51.350 --> 01:45:51.360 align:start position:0%
certainly so I reported this to dcyf
 
01:45:53.790 --> 01:45:53.800 align:start position:0%
also on December
 
01:45:53.800 --> 01:45:55.709 align:start position:0%
also on December
uh

01:45:55.709 --> 01:45:55.719 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:45:55.719 --> 01:45:57.910 align:start position:0%
uh
14th

01:45:57.910 --> 01:45:57.920 align:start position:0%
14th
 
01:46:00.430 --> 01:46:00.440 align:start position:0%
2022 the conquer uh the Manchester
 
01:46:02.390 --> 01:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
police have a police report they
 
01:46:03.950 --> 01:46:03.960 align:start position:0%
self-reported to
 
01:46:06.149 --> 01:46:06.159 align:start position:0%
dcyf um there's a lot of collusion
 
01:46:08.030 --> 01:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
that's going on with the the Manchester
 
01:46:10.109 --> 01:46:10.119 align:start position:0%
police the Manchester police officer was
 
01:46:12.830 --> 01:46:12.840 align:start position:0%
just arrested for violating this is
 
01:46:15.510 --> 01:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
again last week uh for
 
01:46:19.510 --> 01:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
violating um he has six counts of
 
01:46:23.189 --> 01:46:23.199 align:start position:0%
violence uh and one count of op uh
 
01:46:26.070 --> 01:46:26.080 align:start position:0%
hiding a crime he was arrested by the
 
01:46:28.669 --> 01:46:28.679 align:start position:0%
state TR Troopers he self turned himself
 
01:46:32.990 --> 01:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
in so what happens is the the women's
 
01:46:35.149 --> 01:46:35.159 align:start position:0%
Bar Association Jerry Manders the family
 
01:46:38.870 --> 01:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
courts they specifically on their on
 
01:46:44.430 --> 01:46:44.440 align:start position:0%
their page it says that they are uh for
 
01:46:46.390 --> 01:46:46.400 align:start position:0%
families and women women and families
 
01:46:48.870 --> 01:46:48.880 align:start position:0%
gain equity in women and families and
 
01:46:51.950 --> 01:46:51.960 align:start position:0%
women and children specifically and then
 
01:46:54.270 --> 01:46:54.280 align:start position:0%
they also said that they talk to judges
 
01:46:56.870 --> 01:46:56.880 align:start position:0%
government officials including dcy so we
 
01:46:59.310 --> 01:46:59.320 align:start position:0%
have a Prejudice and so when when you
 
01:47:01.990 --> 01:47:02.000 align:start position:0%
see what happens you you'll hear mostly
 
01:47:04.470 --> 01:47:04.480 align:start position:0%
men or but when it's women it's because
 
01:47:06.870 --> 01:47:06.880 align:start position:0%
they don't act like they're supposed to
 
01:47:09.910 --> 01:47:09.920 align:start position:0%
act which is submissive they fight for
 
01:47:11.910 --> 01:47:11.920 align:start position:0%
their rights women aren't supposed to
 
01:47:13.830 --> 01:47:13.840 align:start position:0%
that's the bias that's going on in our
 
01:47:16.550 --> 01:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
courtrooms so again everything is done
 
01:47:20.070 --> 01:47:20.080 align:start position:0%
by court so so so some of the I just
 
01:47:21.350 --> 01:47:21.360 align:start position:0%
want to let you guys know because I
 
01:47:22.910 --> 01:47:22.920 align:start position:0%
wrote some notes when you're speaking
 
01:47:24.149 --> 01:47:24.159 align:start position:0%
and I really appreciate I think they
 
01:47:27.030 --> 01:47:27.040 align:start position:0%
we're trying to figure this out I even R
 
01:47:29.629 --> 01:47:29.639 align:start position:0%
Greg I appreciate we have some
 
01:47:32.589 --> 01:47:32.599 align:start position:0%
different but I think that you really
 
01:47:34.910 --> 01:47:34.920 align:start position:0%
care I think we all really care so the
 
01:47:36.950 --> 01:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
police when you report this to the
 
01:47:39.430 --> 01:47:39.440 align:start position:0%
police they're mandatory
 
01:47:42.189 --> 01:47:42.199 align:start position:0%
reporter DCF should be working with the
 
01:47:45.870 --> 01:47:45.880 align:start position:0%
police to make an arrest
 
01:47:49.550 --> 01:47:49.560 align:start position:0%
arrest arrest of the crime probable
 
01:47:51.669 --> 01:47:51.679 align:start position:0%
cause is all that you need sometimes a
 
01:47:53.189 --> 01:47:53.199 align:start position:0%
police officer could call and say say
 
01:47:55.470 --> 01:47:55.480 align:start position:0%
hey I have some questions we heard this
 
01:47:58.550 --> 01:47:58.560 align:start position:0%
concern it needs to start with the
 
01:48:02.550 --> 01:48:02.560 align:start position:0%
police and then work with DCF because
 
01:48:04.790 --> 01:48:04.800 align:start position:0%
the entire purpose of the criminal
 
01:48:08.030 --> 01:48:08.040 align:start position:0%
system is for refer reform and that's by
 
01:48:11.030 --> 01:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
Statute reform we're trying to fix this
 
01:48:14.470 --> 01:48:14.480 align:start position:0%
we are humans now obviously when it gets
 
01:48:18.430 --> 01:48:18.440 align:start position:0%
to the point of someone being Beat to
 
01:48:20.589 --> 01:48:20.599 align:start position:0%
Death Or severely
 
01:48:23.830 --> 01:48:23.840 align:start position:0%
abused that's a big deal but if someone
 
01:48:25.709 --> 01:48:25.719 align:start position:0%
loses their temper and an accident
 
01:48:28.109 --> 01:48:28.119 align:start position:0%
happens we want to nip that in the bud
 
01:48:29.629 --> 01:48:29.639 align:start position:0%
and give them the resources that they
 
01:48:32.189 --> 01:48:32.199 align:start position:0%
need no drugs were involved in my case
 
01:48:33.990 --> 01:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
and that's where it really comes down to
 
01:48:36.510 --> 01:48:36.520 align:start position:0%
the people who have the most money you
 
01:48:38.589 --> 01:48:38.599 align:start position:0%
will never see a kid getting taken away
 
01:48:41.189 --> 01:48:41.199 align:start position:0%
from a rich family it is only the poor
 
01:48:43.510 --> 01:48:43.520 align:start position:0%
since the beginning of time and there's
 
01:48:47.229 --> 01:48:47.239 align:start position:0%
historical uh backups for that and uh
 
01:48:50.870 --> 01:48:50.880 align:start position:0%
where they used to uh go in in the 1600s
 
01:48:52.990 --> 01:48:53.000 align:start position:0%
and I have this in a memorandum of law
 
01:48:57.310 --> 01:48:57.320 align:start position:0%
in the 1600s they used to go and um to
 
01:48:59.750 --> 01:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
the people's houses and they would take
 
01:49:01.470 --> 01:49:01.480 align:start position:0%
the children away if they felt the
 
01:49:03.229 --> 01:49:03.239 align:start position:0%
father was
 
01:49:06.030 --> 01:49:06.040 align:start position:0%
not working the child enough because
 
01:49:07.990 --> 01:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
children used to work very young on the
 
01:49:09.470 --> 01:49:09.480 align:start position:0%
farms and
 
01:49:12.350 --> 01:49:12.360 align:start position:0%
such so I think I the problem you're
 
01:49:13.709 --> 01:49:13.719 align:start position:0%
saying that you're having all these
 
01:49:14.910 --> 01:49:14.920 align:start position:0%
positions we're getting all these
 
01:49:16.589 --> 01:49:16.599 align:start position:0%
positions it's like calling customer
 
01:49:19.830 --> 01:49:19.840 align:start position:0%
service in India they are powerless
 
01:49:22.070 --> 01:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
positions we need more directors and
 
01:49:24.629 --> 01:49:24.639 align:start position:0%
subdirector it's the same corporate
 
01:49:28.709 --> 01:49:28.719 align:start position:0%
mentality that we have um you call
 
01:49:30.830 --> 01:49:30.840 align:start position:0%
someone up they can't do anything about
 
01:49:34.990 --> 01:49:35.000 align:start position:0%
it I heard a little bell yeah so I would
 
01:49:36.510 --> 01:49:36.520 align:start position:0%
like you guys to ask me some questions
 
01:49:38.390 --> 01:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
because I'm a wealth of knowledge uh but
 
01:49:40.830 --> 01:49:40.840 align:start position:0%
did the judges are lying physically and
 
01:49:42.950 --> 01:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
mathematically impossible findings of
 
01:49:44.830 --> 01:49:44.840 align:start position:0%
fact and then they're burying them
 
01:49:47.270 --> 01:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
physically and mathematically imposs
 
01:49:50.669 --> 01:49:50.679 align:start position:0%
findings of fact and violation of law
 
01:49:52.750 --> 01:49:52.760 align:start position:0%
the last thing I got from my children at
 
01:49:54.430 --> 01:49:54.440 align:start position:0%
after I
 
01:49:57.830 --> 01:49:57.840 align:start position:0%
complained was some stuff so and if you
 
01:50:00.270 --> 01:50:00.280 align:start position:0%
could just wrap it up um so and one of
 
01:50:02.629 --> 01:50:02.639 align:start position:0%
these things I I'm sure that's beautiful
 
01:50:04.390 --> 01:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
art we'll take a look at it afterwards
 
01:50:06.790 --> 01:50:06.800 align:start position:0%
but just showing all of that's not
 
01:50:09.350 --> 01:50:09.360 align:start position:0%
really down this is what my son sent to
 
01:50:10.950 --> 01:50:10.960 align:start position:0%
me the mother the only thing the mother
 
01:50:14.030 --> 01:50:14.040 align:start position:0%
sent to me I was a stay-at-home dad do
 
01:50:17.149 --> 01:50:17.159 align:start position:0%
you see that do you guys see that you
 
01:50:20.510 --> 01:50:20.520 align:start position:0%
see that am I an African-American
 
01:50:24.990 --> 01:50:25.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:29.070 --> 01:50:29.080 align:start position:0%
family okay now my kids never had
 
01:50:29.080 --> 01:50:30.870 align:start position:0%
family okay now my kids never had
counseling

01:50:30.870 --> 01:50:30.880 align:start position:0%
counseling
 
01:50:34.510 --> 01:50:34.520 align:start position:0%
before who's see how the mother has both
 
01:50:34.520 --> 01:50:36.030 align:start position:0%
before who's see how the mother has both
the

01:50:36.030 --> 01:50:36.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:50:39.950 --> 01:50:39.960 align:start position:0%
children and fathers over
 
01:50:43.350 --> 01:50:43.360 align:start position:0%
here this is what they really want if
 
01:50:45.669 --> 01:50:45.679 align:start position:0%
you break up a family for no reason it
 
01:50:47.990 --> 01:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
is abuse on the family it is a tort it
 
01:50:51.589 --> 01:50:51.599 align:start position:0%
is a damage to a family constitutionally
 
01:50:54.310 --> 01:50:54.320 align:start position:0%
the contract that the Covenant the
 
01:50:56.990 --> 01:50:57.000 align:start position:0%
marriage there isn't no fault so what
 
01:50:59.350 --> 01:50:59.360 align:start position:0%
you have what you have isor you you
 
01:51:01.669 --> 01:51:01.679 align:start position:0%
don't have lawyers so thank you I think
 
01:51:04.149 --> 01:51:04.159 align:start position:0%
we've gone pretty far from the DCF on it
 
01:51:05.629 --> 01:51:05.639 align:start position:0%
it's hard because this is something that
 
01:51:07.270 --> 01:51:07.280 align:start position:0%
is so personal that's why we try and
 
01:51:09.950 --> 01:51:09.960 align:start position:0%
give some leeway okay I'll put it I'll
 
01:51:12.550 --> 01:51:12.560 align:start position:0%
put it right to DCF okay human
 
01:51:15.669 --> 01:51:15.679 align:start position:0%
trafficking 633 so um with that you've
 
01:51:16.870 --> 01:51:16.880 align:start position:0%
actually you've had your 10 minutes of
 
01:51:18.229 --> 01:51:18.239 align:start position:0%
testifying I have a feeling that you
 
01:51:19.790 --> 01:51:19.800 align:start position:0%
probably will be back with our next one
 
01:51:21.229 --> 01:51:21.239 align:start position:0%
again I don't want to come back I'm here
 
01:51:23.950 --> 01:51:23.960 align:start position:0%
right now and I have a right to respond
 
01:51:25.830 --> 01:51:25.840 align:start position:0%
to you guys I just want to put it to to
 
01:51:27.470 --> 01:51:27.480 align:start position:0%
help you sorry if you do have a right to
 
01:51:28.990 --> 01:51:29.000 align:start position:0%
respond we'll see if we have any other
 
01:51:30.589 --> 01:51:30.599 align:start position:0%
questions you would ask for 10 minutes
 
01:51:32.950 --> 01:51:32.960 align:start position:0%
you've gone for 12 minutes um this is
 
01:51:34.629 --> 01:51:34.639 align:start position:0%
one where we have other people that are
 
01:51:36.109 --> 01:51:36.119 align:start position:0%
leaving we still have two other people
 
01:51:37.589 --> 01:51:37.599 align:start position:0%
to speak and we have 10 minutes left
 
01:51:39.390 --> 01:51:39.400 align:start position:0%
before the top of the hour I want to
 
01:51:41.589 --> 01:51:41.599 align:start position:0%
make sure that going beyond your time
 
01:51:43.310 --> 01:51:43.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't harm the ability of others to
 
01:51:45.149 --> 01:51:45.159 align:start position:0%
speak so I don't know if there's any
 
01:51:46.950 --> 01:51:46.960 align:start position:0%
questions here from members of the
 
01:51:49.270 --> 01:51:49.280 align:start position:0%
committee um I don't see questions from
 
01:51:50.550 --> 01:51:50.560 align:start position:0%
members of the committee you guys don't
 
01:51:52.270 --> 01:51:52.280 align:start position:0%
ask any questions of anybody who
 
01:51:56.270 --> 01:51:56.280 align:start position:0%
actually knows it so 633 col 7 is human
 
01:51:58.350 --> 01:51:58.360 align:start position:0%
trafficking by abuse of the legal
 
01:52:00.709 --> 01:52:00.719 align:start position:0%
process and so that is abusing my
 
01:52:03.149 --> 01:52:03.159 align:start position:0%
children that's what I reported to dcyf
 
01:52:05.669 --> 01:52:05.679 align:start position:0%
and the police and the Attorney General
 
01:52:07.589 --> 01:52:07.599 align:start position:0%
John formela they're not doing what
 
01:52:10.189 --> 01:52:10.199 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to do your committee
 
01:52:13.470 --> 01:52:13.480 align:start position:0%
needs to take note and follow the law
 
01:52:15.629 --> 01:52:15.639 align:start position:0%
the judges aren't following the law
 
01:52:18.950 --> 01:52:18.960 align:start position:0%

01:52:21.109 --> 01:52:21.119 align:start position:0%

01:53:47.430 --> 01:53:47.440 align:start position:0%
multiple friends of
 
01:53:51.950 --> 01:53:51.960 align:start position:0%
interviews um and every time continually

she says you know Daddy's done nothing
 
01:53:56.910 --> 01:53:56.920 align:start position:0%
wrong but still this agency goes above
 
01:53:59.990 --> 01:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
and beyond its Call of Duty to break the
 
01:54:02.790 --> 01:54:02.800 align:start position:0%

01:54:12.189 --> 01:54:12.199 align:start position:0%
since beginning of the school year last
 
01:54:14.709 --> 01:54:14.719 align:start position:0%
year when I was invited to by her
 
01:54:17.709 --> 01:54:17.719 align:start position:0%
teacher to uh first day at school and it
 
01:54:20.229 --> 01:54:20.239 align:start position:0%
the smile on her face was priceless you
 
01:54:22.390 --> 01:54:22.400 align:start position:0%
know you know she's followed her father
 
01:54:23.310 --> 01:54:23.320 align:start position:0%
in her
 
01:54:26.950 --> 01:54:26.960 align:start position:0%
footsteps um the sad part is is there is
 
01:54:28.629 --> 01:54:28.639 align:start position:0%
no accountability I know we talked about
 
01:54:30.109 --> 01:54:30.119 align:start position:0%
a little bit earlier listening to you
 
01:54:32.550 --> 01:54:32.560 align:start position:0%
guys about committee hearings multiple
 
01:54:35.950 --> 01:54:35.960 align:start position:0%
ones before things happen never happened
 
01:54:40.430 --> 01:54:40.440 align:start position:0%
um I had maybe one Committee hearing
 
01:54:43.229 --> 01:54:43.239 align:start position:0%
where multiple people came and testified
 
01:54:47.550 --> 01:54:47.560 align:start position:0%
on my behalf for being a great father um
 
01:54:50.430 --> 01:54:50.440 align:start position:0%
I've had my child come to church with me
 
01:54:51.790 --> 01:54:51.800 align:start position:0%
um and the first thing the pastor
 
01:54:52.830 --> 01:54:52.840 align:start position:0%
noticed was
 
01:54:55.510 --> 01:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
was she used me as her defense Shield
 
01:54:57.550 --> 01:54:57.560 align:start position:0%
because she's never met him before that
 
01:54:59.790 --> 01:54:59.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't sound like a a person that
 
01:55:03.830 --> 01:55:03.840 align:start position:0%
abuses his child um it's been very tough
 
01:55:06.669 --> 01:55:06.679 align:start position:0%
on myself and I'm here as there is an
 
01:55:10.990 --> 01:55:11.000 align:start position:0%
affidavit there I turned in um to DCF um
 
01:55:13.430 --> 01:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
in reference to this because I don't
 
01:55:16.149 --> 01:55:16.159 align:start position:0%
want other parents to go through this
 
01:55:18.629 --> 01:55:18.639 align:start position:0%
you know having one parent be able to go
 
01:55:21.350 --> 01:55:21.360 align:start position:0%
to DCF and it's weaponized against the
 
01:55:23.790 --> 01:55:23.800 align:start position:0%
other parent whether it's female or male
 
01:55:28.149 --> 01:55:28.159 align:start position:0%
is just not right um do I understand
 
01:55:30.149 --> 01:55:30.159 align:start position:0%
their short staffed could that be an
 
01:55:32.790 --> 01:55:32.800 align:start position:0%
issue possibly but there's got to be a
 
01:55:34.709 --> 01:55:34.719 align:start position:0%
point where people's rights are
 
01:55:37.350 --> 01:55:37.360 align:start position:0%
upheld you know you yours rights for a
 
01:55:38.990 --> 01:55:39.000 align:start position:0%
reason the Constitution's put in for a
 
01:55:40.990 --> 01:55:41.000 align:start position:0%
reason you can't C go around those
 
01:55:43.550 --> 01:55:43.560 align:start position:0%
corners and now my daughter's paying the
 
01:55:46.510 --> 01:55:46.520 align:start position:0%
price I am seeing some medical files
 
01:55:48.229 --> 01:55:48.239 align:start position:0%
because I still have access to her
 
01:55:50.229 --> 01:55:50.239 align:start position:0%
visits and some of the stuff that's
 
01:55:55.350 --> 01:55:55.360 align:start position:0%
going on because of the involvement of
 
01:55:58.910 --> 01:55:58.920 align:start position:0%
DCF she's not doing well and somewhere
 
01:56:01.430 --> 01:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
along the lines we have to hold the line
 
01:56:03.990 --> 01:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
because I'm a very big advocate of if
 
01:56:05.629 --> 01:56:05.639 align:start position:0%
you're abusing your child you shouldn't
 
01:56:05.639 --> 01:56:06.990 align:start position:0%
you're abusing your child you shouldn't
have

01:56:06.990 --> 01:56:07.000 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:56:10.310 --> 01:56:10.320 align:start position:0%
them I I'm I'm here because I'm on the
 
01:56:12.030 --> 01:56:12.040 align:start position:0%
other side of that I've had to go to the
 
01:56:14.430 --> 01:56:14.440 align:start position:0%
state of Maine and have the governor's
 
01:56:18.189 --> 01:56:18.199 align:start position:0%
office re get um Sullivan County
 
01:56:19.430 --> 01:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
involved because there was a wanted
 
01:56:21.790 --> 01:56:21.800 align:start position:0%
fugitive in the house with my child I've
 
01:56:24.189 --> 01:56:24.199 align:start position:0%
had to to call DCF because she was in
 
01:56:27.229 --> 01:56:27.239 align:start position:0%
another situation a couple years later
 
01:56:30.790 --> 01:56:30.800 align:start position:0%
in a house with sex Traffic Offenders
 
01:56:33.870 --> 01:56:33.880 align:start position:0%
that were being investigated DCF did
 
01:56:36.109 --> 01:56:36.119 align:start position:0%
nothing they held a hearing with the
 
01:56:38.870 --> 01:56:38.880 align:start position:0%
court an hour before my hearing without
 
01:56:40.709 --> 01:56:40.719 align:start position:0%
me being in there to hear what was going
 
01:56:43.350 --> 01:56:43.360 align:start position:0%
on after a three-month investigation
 
01:56:45.550 --> 01:56:45.560 align:start position:0%
where my ex was instructed to have her
 
01:56:49.709 --> 01:56:49.719 align:start position:0%
and my child and um therapy which I
 
01:56:52.030 --> 01:56:52.040 align:start position:0%
demanded I'm in it too for all the stuff
 
01:56:53.830 --> 01:56:53.840 align:start position:0%
that I've had to deal with with the
 
01:56:56.750 --> 01:56:56.760 align:start position:0%
system um three months after that
 
01:56:59.870 --> 01:56:59.880 align:start position:0%
issuing she took my child out of again
 
01:57:01.669 --> 01:57:01.679 align:start position:0%
for I think it was the third time out of
 
01:57:03.069 --> 01:57:03.079 align:start position:0%
therapy because the truth was starting
 
01:57:06.510 --> 01:57:06.520 align:start position:0%
to come out dcyf sat and didn't stop her
 
01:57:07.910 --> 01:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
nor did the
 
01:57:11.310 --> 01:57:11.320 align:start position:0%
court this has to change for the
 
01:57:13.830 --> 01:57:13.840 align:start position:0%
children's sake they're our future she's
 
01:57:13.840 --> 01:57:14.629 align:start position:0%
children's sake they're our future she's
my

01:57:14.629 --> 01:57:14.639 align:start position:0%
my
 
01:57:18.270 --> 01:57:18.280 align:start position:0%
legacy and to not have her here because
 
01:57:20.270 --> 01:57:20.280 align:start position:0%
of a broken system and somewhat corrupt
 
01:57:23.310 --> 01:57:23.320 align:start position:0%
in certain areas things need to change
 
01:57:25.629 --> 01:57:25.639 align:start position:0%
you know as a person of the state you
 
01:57:28.149 --> 01:57:28.159 align:start position:0%
know I am a civil servant I work for the
 
01:57:30.830 --> 01:57:30.840 align:start position:0%
government so it's my job I took an oath
 
01:57:32.750 --> 01:57:32.760 align:start position:0%
to protect and defend the Constitution
 
01:57:35.830 --> 01:57:35.840 align:start position:0%
foreign domestic so I'm here to try to
 
01:57:37.910 --> 01:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
fight for other parents that can't be
 
01:57:40.830 --> 01:57:40.840 align:start position:0%
here to that are afraid to come up in
 
01:57:42.109 --> 01:57:42.119 align:start position:0%
front of you and speak I am a little bit
 
01:57:44.510 --> 01:57:44.520 align:start position:0%
today as myself so I
 
01:57:47.189 --> 01:57:47.199 align:start position:0%
apologize it's been a really rough road
 
01:57:49.430 --> 01:57:49.440 align:start position:0%
and I'm hoping this committee can make
 
01:57:52.350 --> 01:57:52.360 align:start position:0%
changes and fix it maybe do some patches
 
01:57:53.629 --> 01:57:53.639 align:start position:0%
it was fixed in the first place we
 
01:57:55.950 --> 01:57:55.960 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have it done patches now this
 
01:57:57.750 --> 01:57:57.760 align:start position:0%
is just my opinion on
 
01:57:59.950 --> 01:57:59.960 align:start position:0%
this and if there's any questions feel
 
01:58:02.069 --> 01:58:02.079 align:start position:0%
free to ask I'll sit here and
 
01:58:04.589 --> 01:58:04.599 align:start position:0%
answer um thank you I want to say that
 
01:58:06.350 --> 01:58:06.360 align:start position:0%
you did a phenomenal job speaking with
 
01:58:08.270 --> 01:58:08.280 align:start position:0%
us uh representative long you have a
 
01:58:10.709 --> 01:58:10.719 align:start position:0%
question thank you madam thank thank you
 
01:58:13.669 --> 01:58:13.679 align:start position:0%
for your uh testimony yes sir uh do you
 
01:58:17.069 --> 01:58:17.079 align:start position:0%
visit your daughter now I have not had
 
01:58:19.550 --> 01:58:19.560 align:start position:0%
any visitations with my child my ex has
 
01:58:22.950 --> 01:58:22.960 align:start position:0%
changed her phone numbers um multiple
 
01:58:25.270 --> 01:58:25.280 align:start position:0%
occasions she doesn't reach out to help
 
01:58:27.229 --> 01:58:27.239 align:start position:0%
me set up any
 
01:58:30.350 --> 01:58:30.360 align:start position:0%
visits um so it's been very hard
 
01:58:33.310 --> 01:58:33.320 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights have been violated
 
01:58:34.990 --> 01:58:35.000 align:start position:0%
to make sure I haven't been able to have
 
01:58:37.310 --> 01:58:37.320 align:start position:0%
visits I'm a lawful Second Amendment
 
01:58:39.870 --> 01:58:39.880 align:start position:0%
carrier and was instructed by a judge
 
01:58:42.709 --> 01:58:42.719 align:start position:0%
that in order for visitations my firearm
 
01:58:45.109 --> 01:58:45.119 align:start position:0%
could not go out with me in public which
 
01:58:47.390 --> 01:58:47.400 align:start position:0%
is concealed 90% of the time my child's
 
01:58:50.229 --> 01:58:50.239 align:start position:0%
nowhere around it not near to be allowed
 
01:58:52.750 --> 01:58:52.760 align:start position:0%
near it um they basically said if she
 
01:58:55.189 --> 01:58:55.199 align:start position:0%
was allowed to come for visits they have
 
01:58:58.189 --> 01:58:58.199 align:start position:0%
to be has to be put up so at any moment
 
01:58:59.589 --> 01:58:59.599 align:start position:0%
if someone were to break into my house
 
01:59:01.870 --> 01:59:01.880 align:start position:0%
and I use my firearm to defend me and my
 
01:59:04.669 --> 01:59:04.679 align:start position:0%
child I would be B basically breaking a
 
01:59:07.589 --> 01:59:07.599 align:start position:0%
court law so at this point I have not
 
01:59:10.430 --> 01:59:10.440 align:start position:0%
had any visitations of my child due to
 
01:59:13.310 --> 01:59:13.320 align:start position:0%
this on top of the fact that again the
 
01:59:17.350 --> 01:59:17.360 align:start position:0%
ex has not allowed me to have
 
01:59:20.109 --> 01:59:20.119 align:start position:0%
any way of communication with
 
01:59:22.790 --> 01:59:22.800 align:start position:0%
her um and as you know I am a postal
 
01:59:25.470 --> 01:59:25.480 align:start position:0%
worker so the background checks are
 
01:59:29.069 --> 01:59:29.079 align:start position:0%
serious so I mean I have not had any
 
01:59:31.709 --> 01:59:31.719 align:start position:0%
violations in no
 
01:59:34.109 --> 01:59:34.119 align:start position:0%
record but this judge still had the
 
01:59:36.709 --> 01:59:36.719 align:start position:0%
weaponization of dcyf to come up with
 
01:59:36.719 --> 01:59:37.910 align:start position:0%
weaponization of dcyf to come up with
this

01:59:37.910 --> 01:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:59:42.470 --> 01:59:42.480 align:start position:0%
rule follow yes follow up so so if you
 
01:59:44.910 --> 01:59:44.920 align:start position:0%
complied with what they're requesting
 
01:59:49.510 --> 01:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
you uh with due to your second amendment
 
01:59:51.830 --> 01:59:51.840 align:start position:0%
would you be able to see your daughter
 
01:59:53.229 --> 01:59:53.239 align:start position:0%
as as long as I followed that court
 
01:59:55.310 --> 01:59:55.320 align:start position:0%
order to the tea I wouldn't be able to
 
01:59:57.270 --> 01:59:57.280 align:start position:0%
carry it with me outside to protect her
 
01:59:59.470 --> 01:59:59.480 align:start position:0%
if we went on any trips outside of the
 
02:00:02.270 --> 02:00:02.280 align:start position:0%
state or anything and as long as it's up
 
02:00:05.030 --> 02:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
and out locked away when she's here so
 
02:00:08.390 --> 02:00:08.400 align:start position:0%
like I said any situation that um could
 
02:00:11.430 --> 02:00:11.440 align:start position:0%
violate the protection of her or myself
 
02:00:13.750 --> 02:00:13.760 align:start position:0%
I would would be breaking the court law
 
02:00:16.030 --> 02:00:16.040 align:start position:0%
to protect her and how long has it been
 
02:00:19.390 --> 02:00:19.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:24.030 --> 02:00:24.040 align:start position:0%
it um my own property at my house two
 
02:00:26.870 --> 02:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
years last was in school first day of
 
02:00:27.910 --> 02:00:27.920 align:start position:0%
school last
 
02:00:33.470 --> 02:00:33.480 align:start position:0%
year thank you thank you thank you um so
 
02:00:35.990 --> 02:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
with us with you not being able to
 
02:00:37.950 --> 02:00:37.960 align:start position:0%
possess your firearm is that only when
 
02:00:39.990 --> 02:00:40.000 align:start position:0%
you're with her or at any time in order
 
02:00:41.990 --> 02:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
to have that visitation in order to have
 
02:00:45.149 --> 02:00:45.159 align:start position:0%
that visitation at any time at any time
 
02:00:46.870 --> 02:00:46.880 align:start position:0%
so you could can't have it with you at
 
02:00:48.109 --> 02:00:48.119 align:start position:0%
any other time or just during the
 
02:00:50.470 --> 02:00:50.480 align:start position:0%
schedule of visitation no the Bas
 
02:00:54.990 --> 02:00:55.000 align:start position:0%
sorry I cannot have it when she is in my
 
02:00:57.310 --> 02:00:57.320 align:start position:0%
presence which is still an infringment
 
02:00:59.030 --> 02:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
but I just wanted to get a clarification
 
02:01:01.950 --> 02:01:01.960 align:start position:0%
if that was all time no anywhere I go
 
02:01:03.510 --> 02:01:03.520 align:start position:0%
it's usually on my side I'm not afraid
 
02:01:05.629 --> 02:01:05.639 align:start position:0%
to protect anyone that needs it at any
 
02:01:08.310 --> 02:01:08.320 align:start position:0%
given time but unfortunately the judge
 
02:01:11.990 --> 02:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
felt well you know since the X made up
 
02:01:14.350 --> 02:01:14.360 align:start position:0%
lies that this is what we're going to do
 
02:01:15.870 --> 02:01:15.880 align:start position:0%
um sorry do you mind if I ask if there
 
02:01:19.270 --> 02:01:19.280 align:start position:0%
were any findings within your case or
 
02:01:20.350 --> 02:01:20.360 align:start position:0%
actually I don't even know enough
 
02:01:22.229 --> 02:01:22.239 align:start position:0%
questions to ask so I'm not going to ask
 
02:01:23.229 --> 02:01:23.239 align:start position:0%
because I'm just going to be digging
 
02:01:24.870 --> 02:01:24.880 align:start position:0%
myself in a hole and I'm probably
 
02:01:27.229 --> 02:01:27.239 align:start position:0%
getting overly personal at question
 
02:01:29.910 --> 02:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
there were every time that my ex put in
 
02:01:32.149 --> 02:01:32.159 align:start position:0%
for a finding they were all unfounded
 
02:01:35.629 --> 02:01:35.639 align:start position:0%
okay and in fact anyone that was on my
 
02:01:37.030 --> 02:01:37.040 align:start position:0%
side actually there was more witnesses
 
02:01:39.669 --> 02:01:39.679 align:start position:0%
on my side to backup that they weren't
 
02:01:41.790 --> 02:01:41.800 align:start position:0%
true representative
 
02:01:44.750 --> 02:01:44.760 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you for that so so as a
 
02:01:48.390 --> 02:01:48.400 align:start position:0%
followup you've never had a DCF case
 
02:01:51.510 --> 02:01:51.520 align:start position:0%
that's unfounded is that correct correct
 
02:01:53.589 --> 02:01:53.599 align:start position:0%
I mean I mean you've never had I didn't
 
02:01:55.830 --> 02:01:55.840 align:start position:0%
ask that correctly Sor you've never no
 
02:01:59.270 --> 02:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
it's my fault I'm not being clear um
 
02:02:03.109 --> 02:02:03.119 align:start position:0%
you've never had a founded dcyf case so
 
02:02:04.950 --> 02:02:04.960 align:start position:0%
all of the orders that you're talking
 
02:02:07.589 --> 02:02:07.599 align:start position:0%
about are coming through your divorce
 
02:02:10.229 --> 02:02:10.239 align:start position:0%
case is that correct um DCF has shown up
 
02:02:12.510 --> 02:02:12.520 align:start position:0%
in the court cases multiple times in one
 
02:02:14.790 --> 02:02:14.800 align:start position:0%
incident um there was a exp parte order
 
02:02:17.470 --> 02:02:17.480 align:start position:0%
put because my daughter was bleeding in
 
02:02:20.550 --> 02:02:20.560 align:start position:0%
her private area and my ex accused me of
 
02:02:22.709 --> 02:02:22.719 align:start position:0%
it brought dcyf invol
 
02:02:25.030 --> 02:02:25.040 align:start position:0%
it was founded that actually my daughter
 
02:02:27.669 --> 02:02:27.679 align:start position:0%
fell and hurt herself that caused it but
 
02:02:29.870 --> 02:02:29.880 align:start position:0%
instead they used the court system to
 
02:02:33.350 --> 02:02:33.360 align:start position:0%
weaponize it against me I see so so your
 
02:02:37.870 --> 02:02:37.880 align:start position:0%
complaint is that DCF has become
 
02:02:41.550 --> 02:02:41.560 align:start position:0%
involved in the other case true ma'am
 
02:02:43.750 --> 02:02:43.760 align:start position:0%
and and am I correct and also
 
02:02:45.709 --> 02:02:45.719 align:start position:0%
understanding that there are times when
 
02:02:49.589 --> 02:02:49.599 align:start position:0%
you have wanted DCF to be involved for
 
02:02:51.830 --> 02:02:51.840 align:start position:0%
the safety of your daughter and you feel
 
02:02:54.589 --> 02:02:54.599 align:start position:0%
feel that they have not intervened
 
02:02:56.750 --> 02:02:56.760 align:start position:0%
correctly is that correct in a few
 
02:02:58.990 --> 02:02:59.000 align:start position:0%
occasions yes okay great thank you very
 
02:03:01.030 --> 02:03:01.040 align:start position:0%
much for that clarification that's very
 
02:03:06.069 --> 02:03:06.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:08.629 --> 02:03:08.639 align:start position:0%
you thank you for sharing that I wish I
 
02:03:10.109 --> 02:03:10.119 align:start position:0%
could formulate the questions that I
 
02:03:12.350 --> 02:03:12.360 align:start position:0%
want to ask for more information but I'm
 
02:03:14.790 --> 02:03:14.800 align:start position:0%
sorry about um just the way that this is
 
02:03:16.189 --> 02:03:16.199 align:start position:0%
going I think my numbers on the
 
02:03:19.030 --> 02:03:19.040 align:start position:0%
affidavit or my address if you want to
 
02:03:20.709 --> 02:03:20.719 align:start position:0%
you can reach out I would feel free to
 
02:03:22.709 --> 02:03:22.719 align:start position:0%
answer anything thank you I greatly
 
02:03:24.629 --> 02:03:24.639 align:start position:0%
appreciate that thank you for hearing me
 
02:03:27.229 --> 02:03:27.239 align:start position:0%
thank you and with that I'll call
 
02:03:27.239 --> 02:03:36.830 align:start position:0%
thank you and with that I'll call
Representative

02:03:36.830 --> 02:03:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:38.790 --> 02:03:38.800 align:start position:0%
kushman thank you madam chair and
 
02:03:40.270 --> 02:03:40.280 align:start position:0%
members of the committee it's good to
 
02:03:43.310 --> 02:03:43.320 align:start position:0%
see you all so I'm going to try and I
 
02:03:45.549 --> 02:03:45.559 align:start position:0%
put five minutes I could speak really
 
02:03:46.950 --> 02:03:46.960 align:start position:0%
really fast and hope that you all can
 
02:03:50.830 --> 02:03:50.840 align:start position:0%
keep up or I can try to um kind of go at
 
02:03:54.790 --> 02:03:54.800 align:start position:0%
a little slower Pace um I I want to
 
02:03:56.790 --> 02:03:56.800 align:start position:0%
bring together pretty much everything
 
02:03:59.109 --> 02:03:59.119 align:start position:0%
that's been discussed here to make it
 
02:04:01.189 --> 02:04:01.199 align:start position:0%
more clear how this all
 
02:04:01.199 --> 02:04:02.830 align:start position:0%
more clear how this all
works

02:04:02.830 --> 02:04:02.840 align:start position:0%
works
 
02:04:06.470 --> 02:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
so first we have the issues within DCF
 
02:04:09.790 --> 02:04:09.800 align:start position:0%
right um they do their administrative
 
02:04:12.390 --> 02:04:12.400 align:start position:0%
tribunals where they do not provide
 
02:04:13.510 --> 02:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
notice to
 
02:04:17.430 --> 02:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
appear they hold their little tribunal
 
02:04:19.629 --> 02:04:19.639 align:start position:0%
privately so they've
 
02:04:21.870 --> 02:04:21.880 align:start position:0%
investigated and they're paid to to
 
02:04:23.430 --> 02:04:23.440 align:start position:0%
investigate then they're paid to hold
 
02:04:23.440 --> 02:04:24.669 align:start position:0%
investigate then they're paid to hold
the

02:04:24.669 --> 02:04:24.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:04:27.030 --> 02:04:27.040 align:start position:0%
tribunal then they're also paid to make
 
02:04:27.040 --> 02:04:28.229 align:start position:0%
tribunal then they're also paid to make
the

02:04:28.229 --> 02:04:28.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:04:33.350 --> 02:04:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:37.229 --> 02:04:37.239 align:start position:0%
they okay um
 
02:04:40.669 --> 02:04:40.679 align:start position:0%
and the the person can never appear to
 
02:04:42.390 --> 02:04:42.400 align:start position:0%
provide evidence against themselves
 
02:04:44.549 --> 02:04:44.559 align:start position:0%
until appeal you get a letter in the
 
02:04:48.350 --> 02:04:48.360 align:start position:0%
mail saying you John Smith have been
 
02:04:53.470 --> 02:04:53.480 align:start position:0%
found guilty in our hearing of abuse and
 
02:04:53.480 --> 02:04:54.470 align:start position:0%
found guilty in our hearing of abuse and
or

02:04:54.470 --> 02:04:54.480 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:04:57.709 --> 02:04:57.719 align:start position:0%
neglect and you have the opportunity to
 
02:04:59.750 --> 02:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
appeal and that's the first time that
 
02:05:03.910 --> 02:05:03.920 align:start position:0%
you can go there and present evidence um
 
02:05:05.390 --> 02:05:05.400 align:start position:0%
of your
 
02:05:09.109 --> 02:05:09.119 align:start position:0%
innocence now this usually follows a
 
02:05:11.709 --> 02:05:11.719 align:start position:0%
interview with a DCF
 
02:05:14.709 --> 02:05:14.719 align:start position:0%
worker um but that is not due process at
 
02:05:17.510 --> 02:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
all and once you're on once they so you
 
02:05:19.990 --> 02:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
don't get that notice the the tribunal
 
02:05:22.109 --> 02:05:22.119 align:start position:0%
is not impartial
 
02:05:25.629 --> 02:05:25.639 align:start position:0%
um because basically DCF is in their own
 
02:05:28.310 --> 02:05:28.320 align:start position:0%
case against you and then they're making
 
02:05:30.350 --> 02:05:30.360 align:start position:0%
the finding in the case against you it's
 
02:05:32.149 --> 02:05:32.159 align:start position:0%
like if your judge came and investigated
 
02:05:34.750 --> 02:05:34.760 align:start position:0%
the crime you were committed committing
 
02:05:37.030 --> 02:05:37.040 align:start position:0%
and then you know dealt your punishment
 
02:05:40.709 --> 02:05:40.719 align:start position:0%
before you ever got to court um so
 
02:05:43.350 --> 02:05:43.360 align:start position:0%
there's the issues there
 
02:05:47.390 --> 02:05:47.400 align:start position:0%
then you're put on a list um a a
 
02:05:50.750 --> 02:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
nationwide list so that's harming your
 
02:05:52.830 --> 02:05:52.840 align:start position:0%
liberty interest right right there your
 
02:05:55.430 --> 02:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
reputation all of that which under
 
02:05:57.870 --> 02:05:57.880 align:start position:0%
common law case precedent it's all been
 
02:06:03.189 --> 02:06:03.199 align:start position:0%
found to be harm right so then go to
 
02:06:06.549 --> 02:06:06.559 align:start position:0%
Family Court if they find have a finding
 
02:06:09.629 --> 02:06:09.639 align:start position:0%
of guilt they may they may close the
 
02:06:12.870 --> 02:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
case DCF may say you abused your child
 
02:06:14.589 --> 02:06:14.599 align:start position:0%
but we're going to close the case
 
02:06:17.149 --> 02:06:17.159 align:start position:0%
there's a problem for children
 
02:06:21.270 --> 02:06:21.280 align:start position:0%
right um or they may bring an affidavit
 
02:06:24.430 --> 02:06:24.440 align:start position:0%
to petition the court to start that
 
02:06:27.109 --> 02:06:27.119 align:start position:0%
process um in family
 
02:06:30.870 --> 02:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
court and correct uh someone had
 
02:06:33.270 --> 02:06:33.280 align:start position:0%
mentioned that it's often hearsay so
 
02:06:35.430 --> 02:06:35.440 align:start position:0%
they'll write in the affidavit uh the
 
02:06:37.189 --> 02:06:37.199 align:start position:0%
neighbor reported this that and the
 
02:06:41.149 --> 02:06:41.159 align:start position:0%
other thing and that's not a true
 
02:06:45.790 --> 02:06:45.800 align:start position:0%
affidavit so they'll get you in there
 
02:06:48.870 --> 02:06:48.880 align:start position:0%
um and so the issues in the court are
 
02:06:50.270 --> 02:06:50.280 align:start position:0%
also there's no
 
02:06:53.310 --> 02:06:53.320 align:start position:0%
impartiality so so first of all to have
 
02:06:56.310 --> 02:06:56.320 align:start position:0%
Equity your accuser needs to have a
 
02:07:00.229 --> 02:07:00.239 align:start position:0%
consequence for falsely accusing you
 
02:07:02.589 --> 02:07:02.599 align:start position:0%
knowingly so where we have a situation
 
02:07:05.430 --> 02:07:05.440 align:start position:0%
where a mandated reporter has no
 
02:07:07.549 --> 02:07:07.559 align:start position:0%
consequence for making an accusation
 
02:07:11.990 --> 02:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
against you and they um and then it can
 
02:07:15.270 --> 02:07:15.280 align:start position:0%
be weaponized by um you know one or the
 
02:07:16.790 --> 02:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
other spouse in a
 
02:07:19.750 --> 02:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
divorce and there is no consequence so
 
02:07:22.589 --> 02:07:22.599 align:start position:0%
like in criminal uh filings like if
 
02:07:24.629 --> 02:07:24.639 align:start position:0%
someone you file a police report or an
 
02:07:26.669 --> 02:07:26.679 align:start position:0%
affidavit to a court about a police
 
02:07:28.750 --> 02:07:28.760 align:start position:0%
you're subject to perjury and you're
 
02:07:30.709 --> 02:07:30.719 align:start position:0%
subject to the crime of filing false
 
02:07:33.149 --> 02:07:33.159 align:start position:0%
police report that's that's where you
 
02:07:34.669 --> 02:07:34.679 align:start position:0%
get equity and criminal proceedings
 
02:07:36.549 --> 02:07:36.559 align:start position:0%
that's missing from the
 
02:07:36.559 --> 02:07:38.189 align:start position:0%
that's missing from the
DCF

02:07:38.189 --> 02:07:38.199 align:start position:0%
DCF
 
02:07:38.199 --> 02:07:39.790 align:start position:0%
DCF
issue

02:07:39.790 --> 02:07:39.800 align:start position:0%
issue
 
02:07:42.990 --> 02:07:43.000 align:start position:0%
um so then you get into the court and
 
02:07:47.189 --> 02:07:47.199 align:start position:0%
everyone in the court from DCF to the
 
02:07:49.589 --> 02:07:49.599 align:start position:0%
guardian Ed lims and not all of them but
 
02:07:53.189 --> 02:07:53.199 align:start position:0%
some of them um any psychiatrists
 
02:07:55.030 --> 02:07:55.040 align:start position:0%
psychologists Physicians that are
 
02:07:57.149 --> 02:07:57.159 align:start position:0%
ordered to provide services to the
 
02:07:58.430 --> 02:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
parent or the
 
02:08:02.790 --> 02:08:02.800 align:start position:0%
child um the referees or magistrates
 
02:08:04.750 --> 02:08:04.760 align:start position:0%
because they're not judges in there by
 
02:08:07.310 --> 02:08:07.320 align:start position:0%
by the payment structure that that comes
 
02:08:09.109 --> 02:08:09.119 align:start position:0%
from the federal government that pays
 
02:08:11.270 --> 02:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
them they are not acting judges in
 
02:08:12.709 --> 02:08:12.719 align:start position:0%
Family Court they are magistrates
 
02:08:14.390 --> 02:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
they're not Court officers that's why
 
02:08:15.870 --> 02:08:15.880 align:start position:0%
there's no
 
02:08:18.629 --> 02:08:18.639 align:start position:0%
perjury and so all of those people are
 
02:08:20.910 --> 02:08:20.920 align:start position:0%
getting paid by the same Federal
 
02:08:20.920 --> 02:08:23.030 align:start position:0%
getting paid by the same Federal
programs

02:08:23.030 --> 02:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
programs
 
02:08:25.549 --> 02:08:25.559 align:start position:0%
so there's no impartiality the court is
 
02:08:29.069 --> 02:08:29.079 align:start position:0%
incentivized to bring in as many cases
 
02:08:31.709 --> 02:08:31.719 align:start position:0%
as they can and to prolong them and drag
 
02:08:33.990 --> 02:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
them out as long as they can and issue
 
02:08:36.790 --> 02:08:36.800 align:start position:0%
orders and a lot of them know their
 
02:08:39.069 --> 02:08:39.079 align:start position:0%
friends in the court they're friends
 
02:08:41.109 --> 02:08:41.119 align:start position:0%
with the visitation center owners they
 
02:08:42.830 --> 02:08:42.840 align:start position:0%
have their favorite
 
02:08:46.470 --> 02:08:46.480 align:start position:0%
G's it is a very perverse system of
 
02:08:50.069 --> 02:08:50.079 align:start position:0%
justice this is limited in a criminal
 
02:08:52.390 --> 02:08:52.400 align:start position:0%
court because you don't have this
 
02:08:54.790 --> 02:08:54.800 align:start position:0%
opportunity for federal Contracting to
 
02:08:57.470 --> 02:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
chase after federal
 
02:09:01.629 --> 02:09:01.639 align:start position:0%
funds so up until the 1970s child abuse
 
02:09:04.470 --> 02:09:04.480 align:start position:0%
and neglect cases were dealt with in
 
02:09:07.390 --> 02:09:07.400 align:start position:0%
Criminal Court and it wasn't until I
 
02:09:09.030 --> 02:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
think the late 80s and early 90s that
 
02:09:11.589 --> 02:09:11.599 align:start position:0%
dcyf came into the picture we've got all
 
02:09:13.830 --> 02:09:13.840 align:start position:0%
these hands in the pot it is turning
 
02:09:16.270 --> 02:09:16.280 align:start position:0%
Justice on its
 
02:09:19.709 --> 02:09:19.719 align:start position:0%
head and there was some discussion about
 
02:09:21.470 --> 02:09:21.480 align:start position:0%
uh we need more middle management I
 
02:09:23.189 --> 02:09:23.199 align:start position:0%
think it's it's it's not the middle
 
02:09:25.589 --> 02:09:25.599 align:start position:0%
management that we need middle
 
02:09:26.950 --> 02:09:26.960 align:start position:0%
management are the ones who know about
 
02:09:29.390 --> 02:09:29.400 align:start position:0%
the funding incentives and I've talked
 
02:09:31.109 --> 02:09:31.119 align:start position:0%
to dcyf case workers who are
 
02:09:33.709 --> 02:09:33.719 align:start position:0%
whistleblowers who say it's not the head
 
02:09:36.310 --> 02:09:36.320 align:start position:0%
who comes in and tries to fix things and
 
02:09:38.390 --> 02:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
it's not the people on the ground for
 
02:09:41.589 --> 02:09:41.599 align:start position:0%
the most part who are carrying out the
 
02:09:44.910 --> 02:09:44.920 align:start position:0%
day-to-day um work case work but the
 
02:09:46.629 --> 02:09:46.639 align:start position:0%
middle management that is looking for
 
02:09:49.270 --> 02:09:49.280 align:start position:0%
the funding so I believe that the
 
02:09:51.910 --> 02:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
solution is to
 
02:09:54.350 --> 02:09:54.360 align:start position:0%
put they the family court was created to
 
02:09:57.270 --> 02:09:57.280 align:start position:0%
like mix all of these civil criminal and
 
02:09:57.280 --> 02:09:58.790 align:start position:0%
like mix all of these civil criminal and
Equity

02:09:58.790 --> 02:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
Equity
 
02:10:01.390 --> 02:10:01.400 align:start position:0%
cases and it it doesn't work that way
 
02:10:02.669 --> 02:10:02.679 align:start position:0%
because there's a different way to
 
02:10:05.350 --> 02:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
handle all of those under common law and
 
02:10:07.270 --> 02:10:07.280 align:start position:0%
they came in and said forget what the
 
02:10:11.149 --> 02:10:11.159 align:start position:0%
the case the jurist Prudence system um
 
02:10:14.189 --> 02:10:14.199 align:start position:0%
has declared to be right over you know
 
02:10:17.069 --> 02:10:17.079 align:start position:0%
hundreds and hundreds of years of you
 
02:10:20.030 --> 02:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
know fi case findings and court rulings
 
02:10:22.750 --> 02:10:22.760 align:start position:0%
plus the principles of of law we're
 
02:10:24.390 --> 02:10:24.400 align:start position:0%
going to write it in statute and mix
 
02:10:26.350 --> 02:10:26.360 align:start position:0%
them all together and this is how the
 
02:10:30.350 --> 02:10:30.360 align:start position:0%
Court's going to move so it has it's
 
02:10:31.709 --> 02:10:31.719 align:start position:0%
just really not the way that it's
 
02:10:34.270 --> 02:10:34.280 align:start position:0%
supposed to work and it's so complicated
 
02:10:36.030 --> 02:10:36.040 align:start position:0%
when really law is supposed to be very
 
02:10:38.830 --> 02:10:38.840 align:start position:0%
simple and it is if you parse all of
 
02:10:40.629 --> 02:10:40.639 align:start position:0%
those pieces out separately so if a
 
02:10:40.639 --> 02:10:42.270 align:start position:0%
those pieces out separately so if a
divorce

02:10:42.270 --> 02:10:42.280 align:start position:0%
divorce
 
02:10:45.950 --> 02:10:45.960 align:start position:0%
a um if you're having a divorce that
 
02:10:47.430 --> 02:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
would be an equity because you're
 
02:10:50.149 --> 02:10:50.159 align:start position:0%
dividing up property that's and they got
 
02:10:51.870 --> 02:10:51.880 align:start position:0%
rid of equity courts
 
02:10:54.030 --> 02:10:54.040 align:start position:0%
a couple decades ago but that would be
 
02:10:56.470 --> 02:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
straight Equity if there's a component
 
02:10:59.629 --> 02:10:59.639 align:start position:0%
of domestic violence then one of the
 
02:11:03.189 --> 02:11:03.199 align:start position:0%
divorce a goes and files a police report
 
02:11:06.709 --> 02:11:06.719 align:start position:0%
or an affidavit to the court to confer
 
02:11:09.790 --> 02:11:09.800 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction and then abuse and neglect
 
02:11:13.109 --> 02:11:13.119 align:start position:0%
is also criminal then if they have civil
 
02:11:14.830 --> 02:11:14.840 align:start position:0%
claims they can pursue that in Civil
 
02:11:17.830 --> 02:11:17.840 align:start position:0%
Court combining all of these things
 
02:11:19.990 --> 02:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
under these statutes where Federal
 
02:11:22.910 --> 02:11:22.920 align:start position:0%
funding is what being chased has just
 
02:11:25.510 --> 02:11:25.520 align:start position:0%
completely clouded Justice in the
 
02:11:27.910 --> 02:11:27.920 align:start position:0%
ability to give it
 
02:11:31.549 --> 02:11:31.559 align:start position:0%
now if we funded this since the
 
02:11:36.069 --> 02:11:36.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:40.069 --> 02:11:40.079 align:start position:0%
1997 child abuse cases have increased
 
02:11:40.079 --> 02:11:41.470 align:start position:0%
1997 child abuse cases have increased
over

02:11:41.470 --> 02:11:41.480 align:start position:0%
over
 
02:11:41.480 --> 02:11:44.669 align:start position:0%
over
800%

02:11:44.669 --> 02:11:44.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:47.069 --> 02:11:47.079 align:start position:0%
Nationwide I do not believe that it is
 
02:11:49.910 --> 02:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
because parents are abusing their kids
 
02:11:52.669 --> 02:11:52.679 align:start position:0%
more because we've actually moved to a
 
02:11:55.589 --> 02:11:55.599 align:start position:0%
point in society where abuse is very
 
02:11:57.629 --> 02:11:57.639 align:start position:0%
highly frowned upon and shamed even
 
02:11:59.669 --> 02:11:59.679 align:start position:0%
corporal punishment
 
02:12:02.750 --> 02:12:02.760 align:start position:0%
is I think that these incentives have
 
02:12:05.669 --> 02:12:05.679 align:start position:0%
created the this kind of case
 
02:12:09.270 --> 02:12:09.280 align:start position:0%
handling and and I do believe there is
 
02:12:09.280 --> 02:12:10.390 align:start position:0%
handling and and I do believe there is
some

02:12:10.390 --> 02:12:10.400 align:start position:0%
some
 
02:12:13.030 --> 02:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
corruption I think that there are some
 
02:12:14.709 --> 02:12:14.719 align:start position:0%
some impeachments that need to follow
 
02:12:16.950 --> 02:12:16.960 align:start position:0%
some real serious investigations I think
 
02:12:18.910 --> 02:12:18.920 align:start position:0%
that there are subpoenas that need to be
 
02:12:21.870 --> 02:12:21.880 align:start position:0%
sought after and potentially even
 
02:12:24.870 --> 02:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
warrants the house has that ability also
 
02:12:26.709 --> 02:12:26.719 align:start position:0%
um I won't talk about
 
02:12:29.350 --> 02:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
names and I know that's ringing I just
 
02:12:31.109 --> 02:12:31.119 align:start position:0%
want to cut touch on
 
02:12:37.030 --> 02:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
a okay okay um the problem with the New
 
02:12:39.030 --> 02:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire courts in
 
02:12:42.069 --> 02:12:42.079 align:start position:0%
particular in in the 70s late '70s there
 
02:12:43.870 --> 02:12:43.880 align:start position:0%
was a constitutional convention and
 
02:12:48.510 --> 02:12:48.520 align:start position:0%
article 72a and 73a were added um passed
 
02:12:50.629 --> 02:12:50.639 align:start position:0%
by the people but the last couple of
 
02:12:53.950 --> 02:12:53.960 align:start position:0%
words of article 73a concerning that the
 
02:12:56.030 --> 02:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
the um Supreme Court would make the
 
02:12:58.189 --> 02:12:58.199 align:start position:0%
rules of the Court they were not
 
02:12:59.990 --> 02:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
included on the ballot that went out to
 
02:13:01.790 --> 02:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
the people and those words are and they
 
02:13:04.549 --> 02:13:04.559 align:start position:0%
shall have the effect of law or the
 
02:13:07.270 --> 02:13:07.280 align:start position:0%
force of law so that's something to
 
02:13:10.709 --> 02:13:10.719 align:start position:0%
investigate also that this this phrase
 
02:13:13.030 --> 02:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
is not actually in our
 
02:13:16.350 --> 02:13:16.360 align:start position:0%
Constitution and common law is supposed
 
02:13:18.709 --> 02:13:18.719 align:start position:0%
to in Rules of Evidence are never
 
02:13:22.510 --> 02:13:22.520 align:start position:0%
supposed to be waved um um and and they
 
02:13:26.870 --> 02:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
use that and they use discretion to
 
02:13:29.870 --> 02:13:29.880 align:start position:0%
um to kind of do whatever they want it's
 
02:13:32.390 --> 02:13:32.400 align:start position:0%
a it's kind of lawlessness in the court
 
02:13:32.400 --> 02:13:33.549 align:start position:0%
a it's kind of lawlessness in the court
so

02:13:33.549 --> 02:13:33.559 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:13:35.990 --> 02:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
that's thank you for coming with that
 
02:13:37.589 --> 02:13:37.599 align:start position:0%
information and thank you for remaining
 
02:13:39.950 --> 02:13:39.960 align:start position:0%
engaged on this topic
 
02:13:42.589 --> 02:13:42.599 align:start position:0%
um I'll take any questions if anyone has
 
02:13:42.599 --> 02:13:44.350 align:start position:0%
um I'll take any questions if anyone has
one

02:13:44.350 --> 02:13:44.360 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:13:47.189 --> 02:13:47.199 align:start position:0%
so I don't see any questions so thank
 
02:13:50.830 --> 02:13:50.840 align:start position:0%
you very much okay thank you thank you
 
02:13:54.510 --> 02:13:54.520 align:start position:0%
um and with this I will close our um I
 
02:13:56.470 --> 02:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
will close the meeting we will be
 
02:13:58.430 --> 02:13:58.440 align:start position:0%
noticing again for a meeting next week
 
02:14:00.350 --> 02:14:00.360 align:start position:0%
um same time I will try and get the
 
02:14:03.709 --> 02:14:03.719 align:start position:0%
office of the child advocate or DCF in
 
02:14:06.229 --> 02:14:06.239 align:start position:0%
um we may end up uh as we try and bring
 
02:14:08.030 --> 02:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
them in figuring out exactly how much
 
02:14:10.350 --> 02:14:10.360 align:start position:0%
time to have on work sessions versus um
 
02:14:12.030 --> 02:14:12.040 align:start position:0%
hearing from the public just to make
 
02:14:13.549 --> 02:14:13.559 align:start position:0%
sure we're managing our time but I think
 
02:14:15.109 --> 02:14:15.119 align:start position:0%
we had a great discussion during that
 
02:14:17.510 --> 02:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
first hour so with that thank you very
 
02:14:36.030 --> 02:14:36.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:38.510 --> 02:14:38.520 align:start position:0%
um so I think we won't uh we won't be
 
02:14:40.750 --> 02:14:40.760 align:start position:0%
meeting next week um we will be waiting
 
02:14:42.189 --> 02:14:42.199 align:start position:0%
meeting a week after that I'd like to
 
02:14:45.069 --> 02:14:45.079 align:start position:0%
know your availability the Mondays until
 
02:14:46.870 --> 02:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
um we move into summer so we know which
 
02:14:48.350 --> 02:14:48.360 align:start position:0%
ones and so we can get people on our
 
02:14:51.109 --> 02:14:51.119 align:start position:0%
dance card to come and speak with us so
 
02:14:58.589 --> 02:14:58.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:08.149 --> 02:15:08.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:19.950 --> 02:15:19.960 align:start position:0%
