walking you through the bill um and
 
00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
explaining why I introduced
 
00:08:59.670 --> 00:08:59.680 align:start position:0%
it so on page one lines four and five it
 
00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:02.360 align:start position:0%
adds language to the educational tax
 
00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:04.680 align:start position:0%
rate set by the commissioner of the
 
00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:06.200 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue to include an
 
00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:07.880 align:start position:0%
additional amount equaling the costs
 
00:09:10.269 --> 00:09:10.279 align:start position:0%
needed for a truly adequate education
 
00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:14.360 align:start position:0%
for uh special education services online
 
00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
lines 9 through 12 on the same page it
 
00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:18.040 align:start position:0%
states that the revenue from this
 
00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:20.200 align:start position:0%
additional amount uh for the cost of
 
00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:22.200 align:start position:0%

00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:25.800 align:start position:0%
deposited in the education uh trust fund
 
00:09:29.949 --> 00:09:29.959 align:start position:0%
on page one lines 18 through 20 it adds
 
00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
language to make it clear what uh equal
 
00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:36.120 align:start position:0%
education opportunities means and that
 
00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:37.800 align:start position:0%
providing an appropriate public
 
00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
education that also regard special
 
00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:41.240 align:start position:0%
education services as part of the
 
00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:43.880 align:start position:0%
state's duty to provide a constitu
 
00:09:46.829 --> 00:09:46.839 align:start position:0%
constitutionally adequate education uh
 
00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:51.200 align:start position:0%
page one line 23 through page two lines
 
00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
23 shifts a burden to the state through
 
00:09:56.069 --> 00:09:56.079 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund to provide the
 
00:09:58.230 --> 00:09:58.240 align:start position:0%
cost of all services for a child who has
 
00:10:00.949 --> 00:10:00.959 align:start position:0%
an IEP ensuring that they receive a fair
 
00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:03.200 align:start position:0%
public education the State Board of
 
00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
Education would adopt the rules for
 
00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
school districts applying for and
 
00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:10.120 align:start position:0%
identifying special education costs page
 
00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
two lines 26 through 32 as well as 33
 
00:10:17.829 --> 00:10:17.839 align:start position:0%
through 36 again updates language to
 
00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:19.720 align:start position:0%
specify that children who qualify for
 
00:10:21.389 --> 00:10:21.399 align:start position:0%
special education services are
 
00:10:22.949 --> 00:10:22.959 align:start position:0%
considered and included in the state
 
00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:24.720 align:start position:0%
policy that all students are provided
 
00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
with the opportunity to acquire an
 
00:10:28.269 --> 00:10:28.279 align:start position:0%
adequate education that will prepare
 
00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:32.800 align:start position:0%
them for life at after school um lastly
 
00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:35.320 align:start position:0%
page three lines 1 through 18 amends the
 
00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:37.560 align:start position:0%
current mechanism for including special
 
00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:39.240 align:start position:0%
education costs and the adequate
 
00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:42.920 align:start position:0%
education amount lines 13 through 14
 
00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
deletes the current funding of 2,100 and
 
00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
ads language to ensure that special
 
00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
education costs are added to the total
 
00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:53.680 align:start position:0%
uh under page three lines 8 through 12
 
00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
um so I think everything else in the
 
00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
bill kind of speaks for itself I'm
 
00:10:59.350 --> 00:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
admittedly not an expert on this so I'm
 
00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
open to uh the wisdom of the committee
 
00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
to any changes they see fit that matches
 
00:11:07.389 --> 00:11:07.399 align:start position:0%
uh the intent of this bill um it's it's
 
00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:09.200 align:start position:0%
really the first time I've put in
 
00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:13.320 align:start position:0%
education bills um I I grew up in an IEP
 
00:11:15.949 --> 00:11:15.959 align:start position:0%
granted it was in Massachusetts I think
 
00:11:20.069 --> 00:11:20.079 align:start position:0%
because I had um an IEP it set me up for
 
00:11:22.949 --> 00:11:22.959 align:start position:0%
Success I'm in law school now I'm a rep
 
00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
um and you know I'm pretty passionate
 
00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:29.800 align:start position:0%
about making sure that we um Ure special
 
00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
education costs um are adequately funded
 
00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:35.720 align:start position:0%
um not being an expert there are people
 
00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:38.160 align:start position:0%
lined up after me uh who may be better
 
00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:41.160 align:start position:0%
fit at answering some of your questions
 
00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
um but I'm happy to take any that you
 
00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:52.200 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chair good morning
 
00:11:54.829 --> 00:11:54.839 align:start position:0%
representative um I'm just questioning
 
00:11:58.949 --> 00:11:58.959 align:start position:0%
um the intent is it are you looking to
 
00:12:01.949 --> 00:12:01.959 align:start position:0%
to add the cost of special ed to be the
 
00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:05.200 align:start position:0%
same as base adequacy the 4100 is that
 
00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
what that means well it it shifts it
 
00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:10.040 align:start position:0%
from local to state to make sure that
 
00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
it's funded adequately across um New
 
00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:16.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire regardless what that okay
 
00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:19.000 align:start position:0%
regardless what that amount is uh yes
 
00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.670 align:start position:0%
regardless what that amount is uh yes
okay

00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:20.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
the know we have special ucation a SE
 
00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:34.470 align:start position:0%
the know we have special ucation a SE
fromy

00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.790 align:start position:0%
 
though

00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:43.800 align:start position:0%
though
 
00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:52.230 align:start position:0%
though
[Music]

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:55.069 --> 00:12:55.079 align:start position:0%
respons so three and a half times so the
 
00:12:59.670 --> 00:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
district has to pop up the $70,000 first
 
00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
then between the three and a half and
 
00:13:06.189 --> 00:13:06.199 align:start position:0%
the 10 times that cost State ks in 80%
 
00:13:13.949 --> 00:13:13.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:17.560 align:start position:0%
cost Beyond 10 times that average the
 
00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:20.160 align:start position:0%
state pays
 
00:13:23.629 --> 00:13:23.639 align:start position:0%
that that's their with along with that
 
00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
80% so looking at have you done any
 
00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:29.320 align:start position:0%
calculations far
 
00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:39.240 align:start position:0%
stuc um to be honest no um there is a
 
00:13:41.069 --> 00:13:41.079 align:start position:0%
fiscal note that we're waiting for how
 
00:13:44.949 --> 00:13:44.959 align:start position:0%
the how this bill would impact um I
 
00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:47.440 align:start position:0%
haven't all I can say to that is I I
 
00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:50.040 align:start position:0%
have heard from constituents um in my
 
00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:52.120 align:start position:0%
district and others that don't believe
 
00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
currently um special education is
 
00:13:58.310 --> 00:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
adequately funded um and I believe this
 
00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
this proc process would um fund it more
 
00:14:05.389 --> 00:14:05.399 align:start position:0%
fairly and ensure that we uphold our
 
00:14:05.399 --> 00:14:07.150 align:start position:0%
fairly and ensure that we uphold our
constitutional

00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:07.160 align:start position:0%
constitutional
 
00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:18.870 align:start position:0%
constitutional
constitutionally

00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:22.600 align:start position:0%
um testing oh we could now um to make
 
00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
sure that every student including those
 
00:14:29.829 --> 00:14:29.839 align:start position:0%
um getting a special education um um
 
00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:32.800 align:start position:0%
gets an adequate education so I have one
 
00:14:37.069 --> 00:14:37.079 align:start position:0%
followup to that how then will we there
 
00:14:39.749 --> 00:14:39.759 align:start position:0%
are districts that may not have a
 
00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:41.600 align:start position:0%
student that qualifies for special
 
00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:42.790 align:start position:0%
student that qualifies for special
education

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:14:47.189 --> 00:14:47.199 align:start position:0%
Aid they don't have maybe a cat Aid or
 
00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:48.720 align:start position:0%
why then are they going to be
 
00:14:50.509 --> 00:14:50.519 align:start position:0%
accountable in the base adequacy for
 
00:14:53.269 --> 00:14:53.279 align:start position:0%
those costs or or why are we going to
 
00:14:56.069 --> 00:14:56.079 align:start position:0%
fund them for those cars when they don't
 
00:14:58.470 --> 00:14:58.480 align:start position:0%
have anybody they may have a student
 
00:15:01.069 --> 00:15:01.079 align:start position:0%
that is IEP are you talking about if
 
00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
there's an IEP of any kind from dollar
 
00:15:08.949 --> 00:15:08.959 align:start position:0%
one you're trying to shift into adequacy
 
00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:10.680 align:start position:0%
is that what you're trying to
 
00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:14.040 align:start position:0%
do essentially um you know I
 
00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:16.440 align:start position:0%
I to the people who help me write the
 
00:15:18.509 --> 00:15:18.519 align:start position:0%
bill um they may be better at answering
 
00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:21.680 align:start position:0%
that question um I I see we have some
 
00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
people from Dr and doe here so maybe
 
00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:26.560 align:start position:0%
those technical things can be asked for
 
00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:29.160 align:start position:0%
them yes sir thank you the questions
 
00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:30.150 align:start position:0%
them yes sir thank you the questions
representative

beler thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:35.000 align:start position:0%
for bringing this bill forward um I'm
 
00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
specifically looking at the line um EMB
 
00:15:40.749 --> 00:15:40.759 align:start position:0%
bolded that says the provision of a free
 
00:15:42.749 --> 00:15:42.759 align:start position:0%
public educa or free appropriate public
 
00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:44.720 align:start position:0%
education under this chapter shall be
 
00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:47.240 align:start position:0%
considered a part of the state's duty to
 
00:15:49.509 --> 00:15:49.519 align:start position:0%
provide every child with a
 
00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:52.040 align:start position:0%
constitutional or constitutionally
 
00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:53.430 align:start position:0%
constitutional or constitutionally
adequate

00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
adequate
 
00:15:56.189 --> 00:15:56.199 align:start position:0%
education um now I'm sure being both a
 
00:15:57.829 --> 00:15:57.839 align:start position:0%
rep and law student you're aware I'm
 
00:15:59.430 --> 00:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
sure others are aware for those not
 
00:16:01.949 --> 00:16:01.959 align:start position:0%
aware um obviously everything we have we
 
00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
have to do here has to be in keeping
 
00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:05.800 align:start position:0%
with the Constitution um but there's a
 
00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
difference between a bill and a
 
00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment so I'm asking
 
00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
given this line clearly is adding
 
00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:16.160 align:start position:0%
something to the Constitution a
 
00:16:18.389 --> 00:16:18.399 align:start position:0%
constitutional requirement how can this
 
00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:20.160 align:start position:0%
be done as a simple Bill and not a
 
00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:21.189 align:start position:0%
be done as a simple Bill and not a
constitutional

00:16:21.189 --> 00:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
constitutional
 
00:16:24.069 --> 00:16:24.079 align:start position:0%
amendment um so my understanding would
 
00:16:27.829 --> 00:16:27.839 align:start position:0%
be that currently the Constitution um
 
00:16:29.269 --> 00:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
ensures that
 
00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:31.560 align:start position:0%
we the lawmakers will provide every
 
00:16:34.309 --> 00:16:34.319 align:start position:0%
student with an adequate education I
 
00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
think that this bill just ensures that
 
00:16:40.069 --> 00:16:40.079 align:start position:0%
the mechanism that we use to do so um
 
00:16:42.509 --> 00:16:42.519 align:start position:0%
upholds the intent of that
 
00:16:42.519 --> 00:16:44.749 align:start position:0%
upholds the intent of that
constitutional

00:16:44.749 --> 00:16:44.759 align:start position:0%
constitutional
 
00:16:47.269 --> 00:16:47.279 align:start position:0%
mandate if I may just a quick followup
 
00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:49.440 align:start position:0%
on that because you're you're correct on
 
00:16:52.069 --> 00:16:52.079 align:start position:0%
the the concept but would that language
 
00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
not say then according to the New
 
00:16:56.069 --> 00:16:56.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution we shall do this
 
00:16:58.949 --> 00:16:58.959 align:start position:0%
not adding this provision to the
 
00:16:58.959 --> 00:17:02.189 align:start position:0%
not adding this provision to the
Constitutional

00:17:02.189 --> 00:17:02.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:06.160 align:start position:0%
requirement um perhaps I I to be honest
 
00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:08.600 align:start position:0%
I don't think a cacr was necessary for
 
00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:10.400 align:start position:0%
the intent of what we were trying to do
 
00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
with this bill um but like I said um not
 
00:17:17.549 --> 00:17:17.559 align:start position:0%
in expert um so I would uh you know so
 
00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:19.720 align:start position:0%
long as it fits the intent of the bill
 
00:17:22.309 --> 00:17:22.319 align:start position:0%
um you know could use the wisdom of the
 
00:17:24.029 --> 00:17:24.039 align:start position:0%
committee you're welcome thank you are
 
00:17:26.909 --> 00:17:26.919 align:start position:0%
there further questions represent
 
00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
cordelli uh thank you Mr chairman thank
 
00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
you representative for bringing this
 
00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:32.669 align:start position:0%
you representative for bringing this
forward

00:17:32.669 --> 00:17:32.679 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
um the um discussion about the amount of
 
00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
the cost of special education services
 
00:17:42.029 --> 00:17:42.039 align:start position:0%
um are you
 
00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:44.200 align:start position:0%
talking uh right now the state
 
00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:49.400 align:start position:0%
contribute some um via uh the uh formula
 
00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:51.200 align:start position:0%
uh that we have for funding plus the
 
00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
district's um uh fund at special
 
00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
education as well are you talking both
 
00:17:59.149 --> 00:17:59.159 align:start position:0%
state and federal dollars
 
00:18:02.549 --> 00:18:02.559 align:start position:0%
to be included
 
00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:06.440 align:start position:0%
in um to be honest if it's okay I I'll
 
00:18:09.029 --> 00:18:09.039 align:start position:0%
wait until someone else to answer that
 
00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
PA yes um I'm just wondering about lines
 
00:18:15.789 --> 00:18:15.799 align:start position:0%
five and six on the first page where it
 
00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:19.080 align:start position:0%
seems um as though you're adding the
 
00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:22.880 align:start position:0%
cost of special education services to
 
00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:25.480 align:start position:0%
swept the Statewide education property
 
00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:27.880 align:start position:0%
tax so it seems to me that you'd be
 
00:18:31.789 --> 00:18:31.799 align:start position:0%
asking the local districts to raise that
 
00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:43.029 --> 00:18:43.039 align:start position:0%
363,000 I wish 3 363 million um plus the
 
00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:46.360 align:start position:0%
cost of special education so I I think
 
00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:48.520 align:start position:0%
you with this language you're actually
 
00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:51.080 align:start position:0%
asking the local districts to raise a
 
00:18:53.909 --> 00:18:53.919 align:start position:0%
substantial increase in the Statewide
 
00:18:53.919 --> 00:18:54.990 align:start position:0%
substantial increase in the Statewide
property

00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:55.000 align:start position:0%
property
 
00:18:59.310 --> 00:18:59.320 align:start position:0%
tax is that is that your intent
 
00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
um so I don't know if if you'll be
 
00:19:04.789 --> 00:19:04.799 align:start position:0%
satisfied with this answer um my intent
 
00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:07.640 align:start position:0%
was to make sure that special education
 
00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
um costs are adequately funded so I
 
00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:11.640 align:start position:0%
worked with experts who are a lot
 
00:19:13.870 --> 00:19:13.880 align:start position:0%
smarter than I am on writing bills uh
 
00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:15.960 align:start position:0%
like this who know more than I do who
 
00:19:17.909 --> 00:19:17.919 align:start position:0%
believe that this language would be the
 
00:19:20.830 --> 00:19:20.840 align:start position:0%
best uh Way Forward um and they will be
 
00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:22.520 align:start position:0%
testifying and probably could offer a
 
00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:24.600 align:start position:0%
better answer further further questions
 
00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:26.120 align:start position:0%
from the
 
00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:28.600 align:start position:0%
committee uh representa are you familiar
 
00:19:30.149 --> 00:19:30.159 align:start position:0%
we have another bill before us that's
 
00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
being that's been put in by the
 
00:19:33.549 --> 00:19:33.559 align:start position:0%
representative from
 
00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:36.320 align:start position:0%
Manchester uh to establish a commission
 
00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:38.600 align:start position:0%
to look at this issue which is one we've
 
00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:41.480 align:start position:0%
been looking at for
 
00:19:44.149 --> 00:19:44.159 align:start position:0%
decades um and we recognize the
 
00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:45.880 align:start position:0%
importance of it but there's a lot of
 
00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
strings attached to it and a lot of
 
00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:49.720 align:start position:0%
technical aspects you know there's a
 
00:19:52.669 --> 00:19:52.679 align:start position:0%
component within differentiated Aid also
 
00:19:55.029 --> 00:19:55.039 align:start position:0%
how we do this
 
00:19:58.669 --> 00:19:58.679 align:start position:0%
so um are you aware of that that she has
 
00:20:01.669 --> 00:20:01.679 align:start position:0%
put this amendment in to really take a a
 
00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
a ster look at this um to be honest I
 
00:20:06.549 --> 00:20:06.559 align:start position:0%
didn't know that um but it's good that
 
00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
we're continuing to have the discussion
 
00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
here further comments from the questions
 
00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you Mr
 
00:20:27.149 --> 00:20:27.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:27.159 --> 00:20:28.909 align:start position:0%
 
Shen

00:20:28.909 --> 00:20:28.919 align:start position:0%
Shen
 
00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
good morning uh my name is Zach shien
 
00:20:32.909 --> 00:20:32.919 align:start position:0%
I'm the executive director of the New
 
00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:34.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire school funding fairness
 
00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:36.640 align:start position:0%
project I appreciate the opportunity to
 
00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:41.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:44.149 --> 00:20:44.159 align:start position:0%
1670 um I've been trying to take some
 
00:20:45.549 --> 00:20:45.559 align:start position:0%
notes to to answer some of the questions
 
00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:47.080 align:start position:0%
hopefully that have been brought up so
 
00:20:50.029 --> 00:20:50.039 align:start position:0%
far um so for uh my understanding of the
 
00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:52.640 align:start position:0%
intent of this bill which is to shift
 
00:20:55.470 --> 00:20:55.480 align:start position:0%
the burden the the financial
 
00:20:57.470 --> 00:20:57.480 align:start position:0%
responsibility from local property
 
00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:01.320 align:start position:0%
taxpayers to the state for paying for um
 
00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:02.720 align:start position:0%
special education
 
00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
services um so during the 2021 2022
 
00:21:08.590 --> 00:21:08.600 align:start position:0%
school year um just under 30,000
 
00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:11.789 align:start position:0%
school year um just under 30,000
students

00:21:11.789 --> 00:21:11.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:14.149 --> 00:21:14.159 align:start position:0%
29715 uh which is 19% of our total
 
00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:15.400 align:start position:0%
student population receive special
 
00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:17.320 align:start position:0%
education services special education
 
00:21:20.789 --> 00:21:20.799 align:start position:0%
costs accounted for about $843 million
 
00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:23.360 align:start position:0%
during that same school year about 25%
 
00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:25.360 align:start position:0%
of the total New Hampshire education
 
00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
expenditures however and these are some
 
00:21:28.549 --> 00:21:28.559 align:start position:0%
of the questions that were asked earlier
 
00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:31.240 align:start position:0%
the state only covered about $61 million
 
00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:32.720 align:start position:0%
through special education adequacy
 
00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:34.520 align:start position:0%
grants so the differentiated Aid side of
 
00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:35.149 align:start position:0%
grants so the differentiated Aid side of
the

00:21:35.149 --> 00:21:35.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
formula with an additional 32 million
 
00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
distributed um for what was previously
 
00:21:41.149 --> 00:21:41.159 align:start position:0%
been known as catastrophic Aid that
 
00:21:43.149 --> 00:21:43.159 align:start position:0%
three and a half or 10 times the amount
 
00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
of the average
 
00:21:46.549 --> 00:21:46.559 align:start position:0%
expenditures uh federal aid and Medica
 
00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
Aid combined provided about $64 million
 
00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:53.240 align:start position:0%
so all told the vast majority of funding
 
00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:56.200 align:start position:0%
is currently being covered by local
 
00:22:02.149 --> 00:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:04.029 --> 00:22:04.039 align:start position:0%
um because we have heavy Reliance on
 
00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:05.880 align:start position:0%
local property taxes who fund not only
 
00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:08.120 align:start position:0%
special education services but also the
 
00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:09.640 align:start position:0%
um the vast majority of the rest of our
 
00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:11.640 align:start position:0%
public education system uh these
 
00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
property tax rates as mentioned earlier
 
00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:16.480 align:start position:0%
vary pretty widely um from District to
 
00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
District depending on their equalized
 
00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
value per people the amount of value
 
00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:22.400 align:start position:0%
they have the ability to tax to raise
 
00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
that funding um so having the roughly
 
00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:29.240 align:start position:0%
650 million
 
00:22:31.909 --> 00:22:31.919 align:start position:0%
that local property taxpayers currently
 
00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:34.600 align:start position:0%
fund currently rais to pay for special
 
00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
education services which are as noted
 
00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:39.320 align:start position:0%
critical services for students who need
 
00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:40.880 align:start position:0%
need them to succeed at the same level
 
00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:43.720 align:start position:0%
as their peers um we currently pay for
 
00:22:47.029 --> 00:22:47.039 align:start position:0%
about $650 million of those Services
 
00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
because the state provides so little so
 
00:22:51.390 --> 00:22:51.400 align:start position:0%
my understanding of the intent of this
 
00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:54.760 align:start position:0%
bill um is to shift that burden for all
 
00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
special education C Services all special
 
00:22:59.070 --> 00:22:59.080 align:start position:0%
education costs from local property
 
00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:02.200 align:start position:0%
taxpayers to the state uh the mechanism
 
00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
that it uses in this bill is as noted um
 
00:23:07.950 --> 00:23:07.960 align:start position:0%
directly tied to swept so there would be
 
00:23:11.029 --> 00:23:11.039 align:start position:0%
a increase in swept which is a property
 
00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
tax and then a decrease because the
 
00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:15.400 align:start position:0%
state would now be picking up $650
 
00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:17.960 align:start position:0%
million more of the funding that we
 
00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:21.720 align:start position:0%
currently spend so I'm sure doe or
 
00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:23.960 align:start position:0%
others could show town by town the
 
00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
impact of that where if your tax rate
 
00:23:29.029 --> 00:23:29.039 align:start position:0%
goes up to to provide the swept but then
 
00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
you now get all the your special
 
00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:33.080 align:start position:0%
education services covered some towns
 
00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
might see a a higher spending some towns
 
00:23:38.029 --> 00:23:38.039 align:start position:0%
might see lower you know Winchester for
 
00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
example had 40 40 something per of their
 
00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:42.360 align:start position:0%
budget with special education services I
 
00:23:44.029 --> 00:23:44.039 align:start position:0%
imagine they would see a significant
 
00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:46.360 align:start position:0%
decrease in the local property tax rates
 
00:23:47.950 --> 00:23:47.960 align:start position:0%
because they would have more of the
 
00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:54.350 align:start position:0%
because they would have more of the
services

00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:54.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:57.390 --> 00:23:57.400 align:start position:0%
covered relative to um the other funding
 
00:23:59.110 --> 00:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
bills that the committee has heard um
 
00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
and I hope that this bill will be
 
00:24:02.230 --> 00:24:02.240 align:start position:0%
included in the subcommittee studying
 
00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
special education funding there's some
 
00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
different ways of approaching this here
 
00:24:08.269 --> 00:24:08.279 align:start position:0%
but I just want to end and I'm be happy
 
00:24:09.269 --> 00:24:09.279 align:start position:0%
answering questions but I just want to
 
00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
end by pointing out
 
00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
that it's important to keep studying
 
00:24:15.630 --> 00:24:15.640 align:start position:0%
this issue but I don't think that anyone
 
00:24:17.950 --> 00:24:17.960 align:start position:0%
can defend the current levels of
 
00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:20.320 align:start position:0%
spending right now um I think it's
 
00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:22.600 align:start position:0%
important to decide and understand what
 
00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:25.320 align:start position:0%
steps we can take as we continue
 
00:24:27.909 --> 00:24:27.919 align:start position:0%
understanding the nuances of the very
 
00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
complex issue that is special education
 
00:24:33.789 --> 00:24:33.799 align:start position:0%
funding and services um but I don't
 
00:24:35.269 --> 00:24:35.279 align:start position:0%
think that the amount that the state
 
00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:38.720 align:start position:0%
currently spends um again about 61
 
00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
million 93 if you include that
 
00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:43.960 align:start position:0%
catastrophic Aid category compared to
 
00:24:46.389 --> 00:24:46.399 align:start position:0%
the total $842 million that we spend on
 
00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:49.000 align:start position:0%
special education services that a very
 
00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
small amount coming from the state
 
00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:52.840 align:start position:0%
requiring significant burden on local
 
00:24:56.029 --> 00:24:56.039 align:start position:0%
property taxpayers um so appreciate um
 
00:24:57.389 --> 00:24:57.399 align:start position:0%
being able to offer this testimony and
 
00:24:58.950 --> 00:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions at the
 
00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:00.200 align:start position:0%
best of my ability are there any
 
00:25:01.909 --> 00:25:01.919 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
00:25:01.919 --> 00:25:03.430 align:start position:0%
questions from the
committee

00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:03.440 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
ref can you just repeat those last two
 
00:25:08.549 --> 00:25:08.559 align:start position:0%
numbers that you just said the state
 
00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:12.360 align:start position:0%
contribution and the total cost yep so
 
00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:16.120 align:start position:0%
this is for 2021 2022 the total amount
 
00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
of expenditures for special education
 
00:25:22.110 --> 00:25:22.120 align:start position:0%
funding was just under 843
 
00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:25.240 align:start position:0%
million the state in the differentiated
 
00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:27.240 align:start position:0%
Aid part of the formula contributed 61
 
00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:28.750 align:start position:0%
Aid part of the formula contributed 61
million

00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:28.760 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:30.240 align:start position:0%
and then if you include the special
 
00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
education Aid that three and a half or
 
00:25:33.549 --> 00:25:33.559 align:start position:0%
10 times the amount that's an additional
 
00:25:33.559 --> 00:25:35.389 align:start position:0%
10 times the amount that's an additional
32

00:25:35.389 --> 00:25:35.399 align:start position:0%
32
 
00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
million thank you very much you're
 
00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:41.000 align:start position:0%
welcome further questions okay the thank
 
00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
you very much Zach thank you um the next
 
00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:45.480 align:start position:0%
to that I'm going to call up here first
 
00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:48.600 align:start position:0%
I'm going to call Mark Mago neelo uh
 
00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:51.720 align:start position:0%
from the doe who is in charge the
 
00:25:53.549 --> 00:25:53.559 align:start position:0%
finance side here and then following
 
00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
Mark I'm going to have Dr come up and
 
00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:08.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
million Mark is coming up neither for or
 
00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:13.960 align:start position:0%
against he's coming up as technical
 
00:26:15.389 --> 00:26:15.399 align:start position:0%
support to
 
00:26:18.190 --> 00:26:18.200 align:start position:0%
us hello everyone Mark
 
00:26:20.149 --> 00:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
manganello Bureau of school finance
 
00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:22.520 align:start position:0%
department of education apologize that
 
00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:23.880 align:start position:0%
this bill does not have a fiscal note it
 
00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:25.240 align:start position:0%
was originally assigned to our sped
 
00:26:28.149 --> 00:26:28.159 align:start position:0%
Bureau but sped Bureau um said to me
 
00:26:29.950 --> 00:26:29.960 align:start position:0%
because it does have some adequacy
 
00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
components um um so I'm going to I have
 
00:26:35.149 --> 00:26:35.159 align:start position:0%
this a memo here with the fiscal
 
00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:36.520 align:start position:0%
analysis but I'll go through the normal
 
00:26:38.269 --> 00:26:38.279 align:start position:0%
Channel and try to get a fiscal note on
 
00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
this bill um um as soon as I as as soon
 
00:26:43.870 --> 00:26:43.880 align:start position:0%
as I get to that so a couple questions I
 
00:26:46.149 --> 00:26:46.159 align:start position:0%
heard I just want to explain um there's
 
00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:48.360 align:start position:0%
a lot going on with sped in the way this
 
00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:52.600 align:start position:0%
bill changes sped as proposed um
 
00:26:55.830 --> 00:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
so uh there's a sped aid program it was
 
00:26:58.029 --> 00:26:58.039 align:start position:0%
formerly known as catastrophic Aid
 
00:26:59.830 --> 00:26:59.840 align:start position:0%
several years ago um it's just called
 
00:27:03.310 --> 00:27:03.320 align:start position:0%
sped Aid that is the $33 million grant
 
00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:04.960 align:start position:0%
that representative lad was talking
 
00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:07.120 align:start position:0%
about where we pay for high cost fed
 
00:27:09.389 --> 00:27:09.399 align:start position:0%
students that's $33 million it's a state
 
00:27:11.909 --> 00:27:11.919 align:start position:0%
funed program um then there's fed
 
00:27:13.269 --> 00:27:13.279 align:start position:0%
differential Aid which is part of the
 
00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:17.200 align:start position:0%
adequacy formula so that is not sped Aid
 
00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:19.000 align:start position:0%
it's sped differential Aid and some
 
00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:20.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes the naming of things can be a
 
00:27:22.190 --> 00:27:22.200 align:start position:0%
little bit uh
 
00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:24.760 align:start position:0%
challenging um and that is the
 
00:27:27.669 --> 00:27:27.679 align:start position:0%
$2,100 for each sped student um so it's
 
00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
a different uh uh different funding
 
00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:33.070 align:start position:0%
a different uh uh different funding
vehicle

00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:33.080 align:start position:0%
vehicle
 
00:27:37.149 --> 00:27:37.159 align:start position:0%
um so this is really changing sped Aid
 
00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:38.960 align:start position:0%
it's making a new sped aid program from
 
00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:41.360 align:start position:0%
the $33 million program to a different a
 
00:27:44.029 --> 00:27:44.039 align:start position:0%
new program a program that's closer to
 
00:27:46.190 --> 00:27:46.200 align:start position:0%
um $869
 
00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
million um but it does a couple things
 
00:27:50.029 --> 00:27:50.039 align:start position:0%
does interact with adequacy in a couple
 
00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
different ways so it
 
00:27:54.430 --> 00:27:54.440 align:start position:0%
actually um when we talk about adequacy
 
00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
in the Constitution the Constitution
 
00:27:57.830 --> 00:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
says cherish education case law La has
 
00:27:59.509 --> 00:27:59.519 align:start position:0%
said that means you need to provide an
 
00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
adequate education case law also says
 
00:28:03.549 --> 00:28:03.559 align:start position:0%
you need to provide an adequate
 
00:28:07.269 --> 00:28:07.279 align:start position:0%
education Define it and fund it um so
 
00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:09.440 align:start position:0%
this is reang the definition of what an
 
00:28:11.549 --> 00:28:11.559 align:start position:0%
adequate education via state law which
 
00:28:13.029 --> 00:28:13.039 align:start position:0%
is something the state does the state
 
00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:15.880 align:start position:0%
defines adequacy via state law and then
 
00:28:19.149 --> 00:28:19.159 align:start position:0%
um describes it funds it Etc um so this
 
00:28:23.789 --> 00:28:23.799 align:start position:0%
is adding special education into um into
 
00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:26.440 align:start position:0%
adequacy so that's sort of the the the
 
00:28:28.750 --> 00:28:28.760 align:start position:0%
flow from adequacy as a a constitutional
 
00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:32.440 align:start position:0%
concept into state law um so essentially
 
00:28:33.669 --> 00:28:33.679 align:start position:0%
What's Happening Here is there's a new
 
00:28:35.669 --> 00:28:35.679 align:start position:0%
sped a program the new sped aid program
 
00:28:38.509 --> 00:28:38.519 align:start position:0%
will be 95% of all sped cost as I read
 
00:28:43.549 --> 00:28:43.559 align:start position:0%
it um so uh sped cost in fiscal year 23
 
00:28:45.509 --> 00:28:45.519 align:start position:0%
were 915
 
00:28:49.230 --> 00:28:49.240 align:start position:0%
million um as I already printed this out
 
00:28:52.669 --> 00:28:52.679 align:start position:0%
and on my walk over here I realized um
 
00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:54.120 align:start position:0%
there is some double counting in there
 
00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
not a lot um probably some double
 
00:28:57.870 --> 00:28:57.880 align:start position:0%
counting of around um at least 12
 
00:28:59.149 --> 00:28:59.159 align:start position:0%
million maybe a little bit more I have
 
00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
to do more analysis but it would be a
 
00:29:04.789 --> 00:29:04.799 align:start position:0%
dozen or so million in double counting
 
00:29:07.590 --> 00:29:07.600 align:start position:0%
um in that number um uh basically two
 
00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:09.440 align:start position:0%
leas reporting the same cost was that's
 
00:29:11.590 --> 00:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
what I mean by double counting um so
 
00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:13.240 align:start position:0%
that number is just a tad bit high but
 
00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:15.200 align:start position:0%
it's pretty close to the approximate uh
 
00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:18.240 align:start position:0%
cost of of what this would would be um
 
00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:21.720 align:start position:0%
so 95% of that is 869 million so that
 
00:29:24.190 --> 00:29:24.200 align:start position:0%
869 million would be raised through the
 
00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:26.720 align:start position:0%
swept so it would be currently the swept
 
00:29:30.509 --> 00:29:30.519 align:start position:0%
is 3 63 million so 8869 million would be
 
00:29:32.990 --> 00:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
added on top of that and that is a state
 
00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:34.480 align:start position:0%
education property tax that would be
 
00:29:36.389 --> 00:29:36.399 align:start position:0%
raised in Revenue so the state would see
 
00:29:39.230 --> 00:29:39.240 align:start position:0%
an increase in Revenue through the swept
 
00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
from the expenditure sides um this bill
 
00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:44.480 align:start position:0%
as proposed um eliminates sped
 
00:29:46.909 --> 00:29:46.919 align:start position:0%
differential Aid which the net cost of
 
00:29:50.070 --> 00:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
the state is around 27 million um and
 
00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:51.760 align:start position:0%
that's a little bit unique in a sense
 
00:29:53.310 --> 00:29:53.320 align:start position:0%
it's because we have this hold harmless
 
00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:54.840 align:start position:0%
if you get rid of sped that's a whole
 
00:29:57.590 --> 00:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
other conversation um but right now it
 
00:29:59.590 --> 00:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
costs 27 million to get rid of uh sped
 
00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:01.640 align:start position:0%
aid for fiscal year
 
00:30:04.149 --> 00:30:04.159 align:start position:0%
25 um it also gets rid of the existing
 
00:30:06.789 --> 00:30:06.799 align:start position:0%
sped aid program which is 30 around $34
 
00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:09.320 align:start position:0%
million um so that budget appropriation
 
00:30:11.269 --> 00:30:11.279 align:start position:0%
would go away um it would be funded not
 
00:30:14.110 --> 00:30:14.120 align:start position:0%
by ETF dollars but by the well by the
 
00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:17.120 align:start position:0%
swept um essentially um so the net the
 
00:30:19.710 --> 00:30:19.720 align:start position:0%
new sped aid program would be 869
 
00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:22.960 align:start position:0%
million so essentially
 
00:30:27.029 --> 00:30:27.039 align:start position:0%
um uh what this would do for the locals
 
00:30:32.990 --> 00:30:33.000 align:start position:0%
is is um 88 million in spend funding
 
00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:37.120 align:start position:0%
would come from um a state Source um the
 
00:30:40.590 --> 00:30:40.600 align:start position:0%
local Source um basically it's shifting
 
00:30:42.789 --> 00:30:42.799 align:start position:0%
from a local local property tax to a
 
00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:45.320 align:start position:0%
state property tax so that shift would
 
00:30:49.350 --> 00:30:49.360 align:start position:0%
be about um uh negative 869 million and
 
00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:53.440 align:start position:0%
so the net change is actually um 61 net
 
00:30:55.549 --> 00:30:55.559 align:start position:0%
Statewide the net cost would be impact
 
00:30:58.110 --> 00:30:58.120 align:start position:0%
on the locals would be ne61 million and
 
00:30:59.830 --> 00:30:59.840 align:start position:0%
the reason why it's negative is because
 
00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:02.080 align:start position:0%
we're eliminating the existing sped aid
 
00:31:04.509 --> 00:31:04.519 align:start position:0%
program and eliminating differential Aid
 
00:31:05.950 --> 00:31:05.960 align:start position:0%
and basically the rest of it's just
 
00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:07.840 align:start position:0%
shifting from a local property tax to a
 
00:31:09.310 --> 00:31:09.320 align:start position:0%
state property
 
00:31:11.549 --> 00:31:11.559 align:start position:0%
tax so that's mechanically what's
 
00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
happening here um uh I have a couple a
 
00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:16.840 align:start position:0%
couple of technical considerations to
 
00:31:19.149 --> 00:31:19.159 align:start position:0%
think about uh with this bill um it
 
00:31:20.509 --> 00:31:20.519 align:start position:0%
doesn't really address federal revenue
 
00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
federal revenue is not described in this
 
00:31:26.909 --> 00:31:26.919 align:start position:0%
system um so potentially you could have
 
00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
the State taking responsibility for
 
00:31:30.269 --> 00:31:30.279 align:start position:0%
something the fed's already claimed
 
00:31:32.269 --> 00:31:32.279 align:start position:0%
responsibility for so more work would
 
00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:34.240 align:start position:0%
need to be done to uh delineate those
 
00:31:36.269 --> 00:31:36.279 align:start position:0%
two those two funding
 
00:31:39.629 --> 00:31:39.639 align:start position:0%
revenues um there could be a lag in the
 
00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:42.720 align:start position:0%
swept um what we can raise in the swept
 
00:31:44.710 --> 00:31:44.720 align:start position:0%
and what we actually have to pay uh the
 
00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:46.840 align:start position:0%
swept needs to be set in advance of tax
 
00:31:49.310 --> 00:31:49.320 align:start position:0%
bills um so there could be a lag in what
 
00:31:51.389 --> 00:31:51.399 align:start position:0%
we raise in swept where it doesn't raise
 
00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:54.120 align:start position:0%
enough Revenue to fully cover this grant
 
00:31:57.590 --> 00:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
um and then um currently the sped Bureau
 
00:31:59.149 --> 00:31:59.159 align:start position:0%
um this is not my SP Bureau is not my
 
00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
program um they currently oversee SP a
 
00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:05.200 align:start position:0%
program which serves 700 students um
 
00:32:07.190 --> 00:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
this program would be serving 30,000
 
00:32:09.029 --> 00:32:09.039 align:start position:0%
students so they would likely need um
 
00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:10.880 align:start position:0%
increased Staffing to to provide
 
00:32:12.750 --> 00:32:12.760 align:start position:0%
oversight over this new
 
00:32:16.110 --> 00:32:16.120 align:start position:0%
program so lot to take in um I'm open to
 
00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:17.269 align:start position:0%
program so lot to take in um I'm open to
any

00:32:17.269 --> 00:32:17.279 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:32:19.310 --> 00:32:19.320 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
cascaden thank you Mr chair and thank
 
00:32:25.470 --> 00:32:25.480 align:start position:0%
you Mark for taking my questions um I
 
00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:28.360 align:start position:0%
understand these numbers but the federal
 
00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
government has never delivered the
 
00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:34.760 align:start position:0%
full cost of a special ed program or at
 
00:32:37.269 --> 00:32:37.279 align:start position:0%
least the percentage towards a special
 
00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:40.720 align:start position:0%
ed to the states do you know what the
 
00:32:43.870 --> 00:32:43.880 align:start position:0%
current uh federal rate is in
 
00:32:46.590 --> 00:32:46.600 align:start position:0%
percentages and then do you know how
 
00:32:49.669 --> 00:32:49.679 align:start position:0%
much the state in a percentages funding
 
00:32:51.149 --> 00:32:51.159 align:start position:0%
versus a
 
00:32:52.990 --> 00:32:53.000 align:start position:0%
local I don't want to put you on the
 
00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
spot but I'm trying to think of
 
00:32:56.029 --> 00:32:56.039 align:start position:0%
percentages to break it out because
 
00:32:58.070 --> 00:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
those are three funding sources I don't
 
00:32:59.310 --> 00:32:59.320 align:start position:0%
have my calculator in front of me but
 
00:33:01.909 --> 00:33:01.919 align:start position:0%
Zach provided a lot of those numbers um
 
00:33:03.909 --> 00:33:03.919 align:start position:0%
uh that were correct so Federal funding
 
00:33:07.310 --> 00:33:07.320 align:start position:0%
idea Grant is 50 million is um so that's
 
00:33:08.549 --> 00:33:08.559 align:start position:0%
Federal funding and like you said
 
00:33:10.350 --> 00:33:10.360 align:start position:0%
Federal funding does not cover that 900
 
00:33:13.750 --> 00:33:13.760 align:start position:0%
million right um uh State funding is the
 
00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:16.200 align:start position:0%
swept oh sorry as the um sped aid grant
 
00:33:18.509 --> 00:33:18.519 align:start position:0%
which is 33 million um then there's
 
00:33:21.269 --> 00:33:21.279 align:start position:0%
differential Aid um which is typically
 
00:33:23.230 --> 00:33:23.240 align:start position:0%
you know ballpark around the 60 $60
 
00:33:25.310 --> 00:33:25.320 align:start position:0%
million uh $60
 
00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
million um so yeah the percentage if you
 
00:33:31.269 --> 00:33:31.279 align:start position:0%
however you tally up those percentages
 
00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
the local share is a lot it true that
 
00:33:35.190 --> 00:33:35.200 align:start position:0%
it's about
 
00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:37.760 align:start position:0%
19% of the of the
 
00:33:40.549 --> 00:33:40.559 align:start position:0%
budget uh 19% of total expenditure is
 
00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:45.480 align:start position:0%
correct yeah thank you
 
00:33:48.190 --> 00:33:48.200 align:start position:0%
yeah further questions you have any
 
00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
followups that to uh represent cascaden
 
00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:52.549 align:start position:0%
followups that to uh represent cascaden
you

00:33:52.549 --> 00:33:52.559 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:54.880 align:start position:0%
good okay represent
 
00:33:57.029 --> 00:33:57.039 align:start position:0%
beler thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:33:58.990 --> 00:33:59.000 align:start position:0%
for the technical sport is very helpful
 
00:34:02.389 --> 00:34:02.399 align:start position:0%
um as is this analysis um assuming the
 
00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:05.360 align:start position:0%
numbers are roughly correct it seems
 
00:34:10.030 --> 00:34:10.040 align:start position:0%
like the total tax increase is 689
 
00:34:11.629 --> 00:34:11.639 align:start position:0%
million so pushing upwards s billion
 
00:34:13.950 --> 00:34:13.960 align:start position:0%
dollars a very big increase but then the
 
00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
next line uh bolded line State
 
00:34:19.629 --> 00:34:19.639 align:start position:0%
expenditure total says of that only 88
 
00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
million is expanded on sped so is this
 
00:34:27.149 --> 00:34:27.159 align:start position:0%
is this suggesting that over $60 million
 
00:34:28.909 --> 00:34:28.919 align:start position:0%
or roughly eight something percent of
 
00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:32.240 align:start position:0%
the bill 8 point something is actually
 
00:34:35.149 --> 00:34:35.159 align:start position:0%
not having anything to do with special
 
00:34:37.389 --> 00:34:37.399 align:start position:0%
education the bill
 
00:34:40.510 --> 00:34:40.520 align:start position:0%
only um no the bill stays within the the
 
00:34:43.230 --> 00:34:43.240 align:start position:0%
framework of sped
 
00:34:46.030 --> 00:34:46.040 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure if I follow the question
 
00:34:47.790 --> 00:34:47.800 align:start position:0%
uh if I may just to clarify so what I'm
 
00:34:50.349 --> 00:34:50.359 align:start position:0%
suggesting is it looks like the state is
 
00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:52.720 align:start position:0%
taking in more than $60 million in
 
00:34:54.950 --> 00:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
excess of what it would actually cost to
 
00:34:57.349 --> 00:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
fund the sped program which means
 
00:34:59.950 --> 00:34:59.960 align:start position:0%
there's more than $60 million that are
 
00:35:01.950 --> 00:35:01.960 align:start position:0%
going to go somewhere here the education
 
00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:03.960 align:start position:0%
trust fund but that's not sped related
 
00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:05.640 align:start position:0%
it doesn't go towards SP yeah let me
 
00:35:07.829 --> 00:35:07.839 align:start position:0%
explain that um so the state is going to
 
00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:10.160 align:start position:0%
raise 869 million through the swept and
 
00:35:13.270 --> 00:35:13.280 align:start position:0%
the state is going to spend on sped 869
 
00:35:17.349 --> 00:35:17.359 align:start position:0%
million but there's a save a um but
 
00:35:18.510 --> 00:35:18.520 align:start position:0%
they've also now the state has
 
00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
eliminated sped Aid so the state has now
 
00:35:22.950 --> 00:35:22.960 align:start position:0%
got a savings of $33 million that that
 
00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
money goes that money just sits in the
 
00:35:26.510 --> 00:35:26.520 align:start position:0%
education trust fund this bill does not
 
00:35:28.109 --> 00:35:28.119 align:start position:0%
spend it would
 
00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
eliminate it it's finding a new funding
 
00:35:32.069 --> 00:35:32.079 align:start position:0%
source right now any spare dollar that's
 
00:35:34.069 --> 00:35:34.079 align:start position:0%
not a swept dollar would be going
 
00:35:36.510 --> 00:35:36.520 align:start position:0%
towards the sped aid program but this
 
00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
program redefines it to be funded
 
00:35:41.950 --> 00:35:41.960 align:start position:0%
through swept so it basically cuts that
 
00:35:44.589 --> 00:35:44.599 align:start position:0%
program because it's redefining it so
 
00:35:46.390 --> 00:35:46.400 align:start position:0%
that money would be just sort of out
 
00:35:47.870 --> 00:35:47.880 align:start position:0%
there it it' be in the education trust
 
00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:49.960 align:start position:0%
fund so there's a cost savings to the
 
00:35:51.630 --> 00:35:51.640 align:start position:0%
state by eliminating the existing sped
 
00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:53.680 align:start position:0%
aid program and building a new sped aid
 
00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:55.560 align:start position:0%
program and then there's a cost savings
 
00:35:57.069 --> 00:35:57.079 align:start position:0%
to the state uh by getting getting rid
 
00:35:59.550 --> 00:35:59.560 align:start position:0%
of the sped differential Aid so I'm just
 
00:36:01.950 --> 00:36:01.960 align:start position:0%
trying to since it this program
 
00:36:04.390 --> 00:36:04.400 align:start position:0%
eliminates existing sped funding
 
00:36:06.910 --> 00:36:06.920 align:start position:0%
vehicles and creates a new one there is
 
00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:09.480 align:start position:0%
some cost savings there um but the total
 
00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:10.630 align:start position:0%
some cost savings there um but the total
sped

00:36:10.630 --> 00:36:10.640 align:start position:0%
sped
 
00:36:15.390 --> 00:36:15.400 align:start position:0%
spend uh is going to be 869 million so
 
00:36:17.790 --> 00:36:17.800 align:start position:0%
what would be increasing SP
 
00:36:20.309 --> 00:36:20.319 align:start position:0%
spend just if I may real quick because I
 
00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
I I follow what you just said but I
 
00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:23.680 align:start position:0%
don't follow how that relates to where
 
00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:26.720 align:start position:0%
it says here State expenditure total 800
 
00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:29.030 align:start position:0%
it says here State expenditure total 800
8,

00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
8,
 
00:36:31.630 --> 00:36:31.640 align:start position:0%
32226 compared to the revenue intake of
 
00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:33.910 align:start position:0%
32226 compared to the revenue intake of
$869

00:36:33.910 --> 00:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
$869
 
00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:35.550 align:start position:0%
$869
m459

00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:35.560 align:start position:0%
m459
 
00:36:39.589 --> 00:36:39.599 align:start position:0%
1865 so you're saying that that that $61
 
00:36:44.270 --> 00:36:44.280 align:start position:0%
is million difference is not uh that
 
00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:47.400 align:start position:0%
that is going to be expended um in sped
 
00:36:49.630 --> 00:36:49.640 align:start position:0%
sorry no it's it's
 
00:36:52.270 --> 00:36:52.280 align:start position:0%
um it yeah I guess maybe it's maybe this
 
00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:54.640 align:start position:0%
isn't a maybe my table could be a little
 
00:36:57.910 --> 00:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
bit more um it's looking at it's it's
 
00:36:59.870 --> 00:36:59.880 align:start position:0%
it's it's trying to it's a little
 
00:37:01.270 --> 00:37:01.280 align:start position:0%
confusing because it's trying to say we
 
00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:05.240 align:start position:0%
are going to spend 869 million in sped
 
00:37:06.790 --> 00:37:06.800 align:start position:0%
but we're not going to be spending
 
00:37:08.470 --> 00:37:08.480 align:start position:0%
spending these existing programs so
 
00:37:11.349 --> 00:37:11.359 align:start position:0%
there is a State Savings for those other
 
00:37:11.359 --> 00:37:12.990 align:start position:0%
there is a State Savings for those other
programs

00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:13.000 align:start position:0%
programs
 
00:37:15.390 --> 00:37:15.400 align:start position:0%
um it's yeah it's a little complicated
 
00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
it's just netting the
 
00:37:19.589 --> 00:37:19.599 align:start position:0%
total the bottom line to your state
 
00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:22.680 align:start position:0%
budget um that $60 million you could
 
00:37:24.069 --> 00:37:24.079 align:start position:0%
take that $60 million because it's
 
00:37:25.349 --> 00:37:25.359 align:start position:0%
sitting in the education trust fund and
 
00:37:27.470 --> 00:37:27.480 align:start position:0%
reapply it to the sped to bring you back
 
00:37:30.589 --> 00:37:30.599 align:start position:0%
up to the 869 million but it's just it
 
00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
it' be do this is more for this is more
 
00:37:34.069 --> 00:37:34.079 align:start position:0%
useful for finance committee because
 
00:37:35.670 --> 00:37:35.680 align:start position:0%
they would see those dollars sitting
 
00:37:39.150 --> 00:37:39.160 align:start position:0%
there thank you I got a question that
 
00:37:42.349 --> 00:37:42.359 align:start position:0%
related to all this um approximately
 
00:37:44.230 --> 00:37:44.240 align:start position:0%
what of the
 
00:37:46.829 --> 00:37:46.839 align:start position:0%
residential uh uh students which we have
 
00:37:49.150 --> 00:37:49.160 align:start position:0%
that're placed outside the resident
 
00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
District uh those which are uh homebound
 
00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
those that are in hospital settings it's
 
00:37:57.190 --> 00:37:57.200 align:start position:0%
approximately somewhere correct me if
 
00:38:00.069 --> 00:38:00.079 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong around 700 kids
 
00:38:03.470 --> 00:38:03.480 align:start position:0%
approximately um we don't know when a
 
00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
student like that's going to show up at
 
00:38:07.390 --> 00:38:07.400 align:start position:0%
the particular districts they oftentimes
 
00:38:10.270 --> 00:38:10.280 align:start position:0%
move around and that's part of the
 
00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:12.160 align:start position:0%
problem the district is coming how do I
 
00:38:15.390 --> 00:38:15.400 align:start position:0%
cough up this huge amount of money now
 
00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
with it coming in the way it is proposed
 
00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:19.640 align:start position:0%
to come into is there going to have to
 
00:38:22.589 --> 00:38:22.599 align:start position:0%
be a separate fund within each School
 
00:38:25.910 --> 00:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
District to ensure that that the money
 
00:38:28.309 --> 00:38:28.319 align:start position:0%
that is needed when that student shows
 
00:38:30.309 --> 00:38:30.319 align:start position:0%
up that it's going to be available to
 
00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
pay off the yeah Services yeah there's a
 
00:38:35.910 --> 00:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
cash flow issue that districts have and
 
00:38:37.550 --> 00:38:37.560 align:start position:0%
most districts uh well I don't know
 
00:38:39.910 --> 00:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
about most districts um substantial
 
00:38:41.710 --> 00:38:41.720 align:start position:0%
amount of districts build a sped trust
 
00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
fund to deal with that exact cash flow
 
00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:45.200 align:start position:0%
issue so they keep money in their bank
 
00:38:47.390 --> 00:38:47.400 align:start position:0%
so they can afford to pay those bills as
 
00:38:51.349 --> 00:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
they come in um and uh they have a a
 
00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:53.240 align:start position:0%
sort of something some appropriation
 
00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:55.640 align:start position:0%
Authority they can tap into um so it
 
00:38:58.230 --> 00:38:58.240 align:start position:0%
would districts would like likely still
 
00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:00.200 align:start position:0%
want to manage for those cash flow
 
00:39:02.510 --> 00:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
challenges if they come up um they would
 
00:39:03.950 --> 00:39:03.960 align:start position:0%
be ultimately under this bill they would
 
00:39:07.349 --> 00:39:07.359 align:start position:0%
be reimburse by 95% so the funding would
 
00:39:09.309 --> 00:39:09.319 align:start position:0%
come in um but you're right there could
 
00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
be a a a there could be a lag as far as
 
00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
when the bills are due and when the
 
00:39:16.270 --> 00:39:16.280 align:start position:0%
money comes in that that's where I'm
 
00:39:18.910 --> 00:39:18.920 align:start position:0%
coming from and with the fact that we
 
00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:21.040 align:start position:0%
have some small districts I have one in
 
00:39:24.990 --> 00:39:25.000 align:start position:0%
my district that has 67 kids in it um
 
00:39:27.550 --> 00:39:27.560 align:start position:0%
receed two residential Place kids in one
 
00:39:31.630 --> 00:39:31.640 align:start position:0%
year they don't have a trust fund so
 
00:39:33.349 --> 00:39:33.359 align:start position:0%
they have to look at elsewhere within
 
00:39:35.069 --> 00:39:35.079 align:start position:0%
their budget to find those dollars take
 
00:39:37.829 --> 00:39:37.839 align:start position:0%
it from Peter to PayPal or they have to
 
00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
take some kind of a tax anticipation Noe
 
00:39:42.910 --> 00:39:42.920 align:start position:0%
out so
 
00:39:45.670 --> 00:39:45.680 align:start position:0%
um recognizing these districts small
 
00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
districts do not have that fund set up
 
00:39:51.109 --> 00:39:51.119 align:start position:0%
they just have don't have the ability to
 
00:39:53.710 --> 00:39:53.720 align:start position:0%
do that financially there's going to
 
00:39:55.950 --> 00:39:55.960 align:start position:0%
have to be some place where that money
 
00:39:58.829 --> 00:39:58.839 align:start position:0%
is a available for those districts to
 
00:40:01.030 --> 00:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
pay for these costs of that very very
 
00:40:03.069 --> 00:40:03.079 align:start position:0%
expensive residential placement which
 
00:40:05.589 --> 00:40:05.599 align:start position:0%
they are on the hook for
 
00:40:07.870 --> 00:40:07.880 align:start position:0%
now I don't I don't know how this is
 
00:40:09.829 --> 00:40:09.839 align:start position:0%
going to do that um without the state
 
00:40:12.390 --> 00:40:12.400 align:start position:0%
having that money and reimbursing
 
00:40:14.270 --> 00:40:14.280 align:start position:0%
whether it's been totally the you know
 
00:40:16.109 --> 00:40:16.119 align:start position:0%
the state's done all which they're
 
00:40:18.589 --> 00:40:18.599 align:start position:0%
responsible for I recognized that when I
 
00:40:20.829 --> 00:40:20.839 align:start position:0%
came on board here there were 210,000
 
00:40:24.430 --> 00:40:24.440 align:start position:0%
kids in the state and we had 30,000 kids
 
00:40:27.589 --> 00:40:27.599 align:start position:0%
which are IEP eligible approximately we
 
00:40:29.790 --> 00:40:29.800 align:start position:0%
have 160 some odd thousand right now and
 
00:40:32.470 --> 00:40:32.480 align:start position:0%
there 30,000 the IEP so there's special
 
00:40:36.190 --> 00:40:36.200 align:start position:0%
head is you know per capita is is
 
00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:38.960 align:start position:0%
increasing I I think um cash flow and
 
00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
distribution of the funding I don't know
 
00:40:43.829 --> 00:40:43.839 align:start position:0%
this bill basically wants the sped
 
00:40:46.230 --> 00:40:46.240 align:start position:0%
Bureau to redesign its rules and so I
 
00:40:48.230 --> 00:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
don't know how much flexibility in law
 
00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
they would have to be more aggressive
 
00:40:52.990 --> 00:40:53.000 align:start position:0%
with their distributions to mitigate
 
00:40:54.630 --> 00:40:54.640 align:start position:0%
cash flow challenges I don't know how
 
00:40:56.349 --> 00:40:56.359 align:start position:0%
administratively efficient it would be
 
00:40:58.750 --> 00:40:58.760 align:start position:0%
to be cutting a lot of checks or how to
 
00:41:01.109 --> 00:41:01.119 align:start position:0%
do how to how to uh uh establish a
 
00:41:02.870 --> 00:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
distribution schedule that would would
 
00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
alleviate that challenge um I can't
 
00:41:06.270 --> 00:41:06.280 align:start position:0%
speak to that and I don't know if the
 
00:41:08.750 --> 00:41:08.760 align:start position:0%
bill um fully sort of thinks about that
 
00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
concept it leaves it to Ru making
 
00:41:12.790 --> 00:41:12.800 align:start position:0%
essentially thank you represent Tanner
 
00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
then represent cordelli and then repres
 
00:41:18.510 --> 00:41:18.520 align:start position:0%
just to make sure that what we're what
 
00:41:21.150 --> 00:41:21.160 align:start position:0%
this bill does is it puts all the burden
 
00:41:23.309 --> 00:41:23.319 align:start position:0%
or the majority of the burden for
 
00:41:26.349 --> 00:41:26.359 align:start position:0%
special education back on local property
 
00:41:29.390 --> 00:41:29.400 align:start position:0%
taxes is that is that probably the
 
00:41:31.470 --> 00:41:31.480 align:start position:0%
result it it puts it all on property
 
00:41:33.870 --> 00:41:33.880 align:start position:0%
taxes um but it would be the swept so
 
00:41:35.390 --> 00:41:35.400 align:start position:0%
it' be a state property tax not a local
 
00:41:38.910 --> 00:41:38.920 align:start position:0%
property tax but but still on my bill
 
00:41:40.470 --> 00:41:40.480 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a property tax property
 
00:41:42.670 --> 00:41:42.680 align:start position:0%
tax thank you refson
 
00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:45.680 align:start position:0%
Celli uh thank you uh just following up
 
00:41:48.750 --> 00:41:48.760 align:start position:0%
on that so the Local District would have
 
00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
to collect the additional $800 million
 
00:41:55.990 --> 00:41:56.000 align:start position:0%
from the local taxpayers that would then
 
00:41:59.870 --> 00:41:59.880 align:start position:0%
get sent to the state to be deposited in
 
00:42:01.870 --> 00:42:01.880 align:start position:0%
the education trust
 
00:42:07.069 --> 00:42:07.079 align:start position:0%
fund and then there would be um through
 
00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
state aid the bottom of page one um
 
00:42:14.069 --> 00:42:14.079 align:start position:0%
there would be some offset sent back to
 
00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
the locals to try and balance out or um
 
00:42:23.589 --> 00:42:23.599 align:start position:0%
reduce uh property taxes because of more
 
00:42:26.309 --> 00:42:26.319 align:start position:0%
specialed money coming in from the state
 
00:42:28.510 --> 00:42:28.520 align:start position:0%
is that correct that's that's
 
00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
mechanically what's happening okay
 
00:42:33.670 --> 00:42:33.680 align:start position:0%
follow up yes um I'm just questioning
 
00:42:37.150 --> 00:42:37.160 align:start position:0%
then um uh State a is on the bottom of
 
00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:40.400 align:start position:0%
page one uh but then in Roman 3 on page
 
00:42:43.790 --> 00:42:43.800 align:start position:0%
two it talks about rules related to
 
00:42:48.069 --> 00:42:48.079 align:start position:0%
school districts applying for special ed
 
00:42:50.309 --> 00:42:50.319 align:start position:0%
under the new state aid
 
00:42:53.150 --> 00:42:53.160 align:start position:0%
program um I'm not
 
00:42:56.309 --> 00:42:56.319 align:start position:0%
sure um I'm not asking you about the
 
00:42:59.390 --> 00:42:59.400 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill but um it seems to me
 
00:43:02.309 --> 00:43:02.319 align:start position:0%
that the district would have to apply to
 
00:43:04.870 --> 00:43:04.880 align:start position:0%
the state to get that funding from state
 
00:43:07.230 --> 00:43:07.240 align:start position:0%
aid according to what I'm reading
 
00:43:09.309 --> 00:43:09.319 align:start position:0%
correct yeah and and swept would have to
 
00:43:11.069 --> 00:43:11.079 align:start position:0%
be raised in advance of that so that's a
 
00:43:12.950 --> 00:43:12.960 align:start position:0%
there's a mechanical challenge there or
 
00:43:15.950 --> 00:43:15.960 align:start position:0%
a lag in when what we predict this the
 
00:43:17.829 --> 00:43:17.839 align:start position:0%
districts will apply for and we will
 
00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:20.480 align:start position:0%
grant and what the swept will raise and
 
00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:21.790 align:start position:0%
grant and what the swept will raise and
so

00:43:21.790 --> 00:43:21.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
um you know I don't know what the
 
00:43:26.549 --> 00:43:26.559 align:start position:0%
methodology would be um it could be one
 
00:43:29.109 --> 00:43:29.119 align:start position:0%
year raise one year and then see what
 
00:43:30.950 --> 00:43:30.960 align:start position:0%
happens next year um it would likely be
 
00:43:33.430 --> 00:43:33.440 align:start position:0%
short because sped costs typically Rise
 
00:43:36.030 --> 00:43:36.040 align:start position:0%
um that's but that's mechanically a
 
00:43:39.150 --> 00:43:39.160 align:start position:0%
challenge with this bill represent
 
00:43:43.190 --> 00:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
leus yes with swap the way we do it now
 
00:43:47.710 --> 00:43:47.720 align:start position:0%
um not all towns can raise the amount
 
00:43:50.829 --> 00:43:50.839 align:start position:0%
that is set for their sweat and the
 
00:43:53.549 --> 00:43:53.559 align:start position:0%
state then covers that
 
00:43:56.710 --> 00:43:56.720 align:start position:0%
difference from the educ ation trust
 
00:43:59.870 --> 00:43:59.880 align:start position:0%
fund and the question is would what
 
00:44:01.829 --> 00:44:01.839 align:start position:0%
would happen with this CU now we're
 
00:44:04.109 --> 00:44:04.119 align:start position:0%
asking even more money to be raised in
 
00:44:07.390 --> 00:44:07.400 align:start position:0%
swept would those towns that can't raise
 
00:44:08.790 --> 00:44:08.800 align:start position:0%
that much
 
00:44:13.150 --> 00:44:13.160 align:start position:0%
money have it covered as well in uh with
 
00:44:15.069 --> 00:44:15.079 align:start position:0%
the represent because I think you're
 
00:44:18.349 --> 00:44:18.359 align:start position:0%
talking about adequacy so so this is not
 
00:44:22.750 --> 00:44:22.760 align:start position:0%
adequacy um so every every Community um
 
00:44:24.069 --> 00:44:24.079 align:start position:0%
has a tax collector and that tax
 
00:44:27.030 --> 00:44:27.040 align:start position:0%
collector collects um uh this is just
 
00:44:28.990 --> 00:44:29.000 align:start position:0%
how local uni vers school districts
 
00:44:31.430 --> 00:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
taxes work um the tax collector goes out
 
00:44:33.230 --> 00:44:33.240 align:start position:0%
and um everyone gets a tax bill the tax
 
00:44:35.109 --> 00:44:35.119 align:start position:0%
collector goes out and everyone sends
 
00:44:36.990 --> 00:44:37.000 align:start position:0%
their tax bill in um in theory they're
 
00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:39.480 align:start position:0%
supposed to pay 100% of it um and 100%
 
00:44:41.589 --> 00:44:41.599 align:start position:0%
of that um in theory what would should
 
00:44:43.630 --> 00:44:43.640 align:start position:0%
be raised goes to the school district if
 
00:44:45.710 --> 00:44:45.720 align:start position:0%
you're talking about communities not
 
00:44:47.549 --> 00:44:47.559 align:start position:0%
receiving their full swept amount that's
 
00:44:49.069 --> 00:44:49.079 align:start position:0%
an issue between the mun and if they
 
00:44:50.829 --> 00:44:50.839 align:start position:0%
want to put a lean on that property but
 
00:44:54.630 --> 00:44:54.640 align:start position:0%
that's a separate issue okay so always
 
00:44:58.750 --> 00:44:58.760 align:start position:0%
all the swep money has to be collected
 
00:44:59.910 --> 00:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
correct and have to be paid to the
 
00:45:01.510 --> 00:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
school district than and that's what we
 
00:45:03.109 --> 00:45:03.119 align:start position:0%
what I would imagine would happen here
 
00:45:04.470 --> 00:45:04.480 align:start position:0%
okay thank you are there any more
 
00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:06.880 align:start position:0%
questions yes represent Bel thank you Mr
 
00:45:09.549 --> 00:45:09.559 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for this um I have
 
00:45:11.349 --> 00:45:11.359 align:start position:0%
an idea in my head about a incentive
 
00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
structure that this could create so just
 
00:45:15.430 --> 00:45:15.440 align:start position:0%
a very simple question as of right now
 
00:45:17.270 --> 00:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
the way this works when a child has to
 
00:45:20.390 --> 00:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
get an IEP um the approval process for
 
00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:22.960 align:start position:0%
that that all occurs at the local level
 
00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
correct um I believe so I'm not a SP SP
 
00:45:29.589 --> 00:45:29.599 align:start position:0%
bu's behind me but yeah local thank
 
00:45:32.150 --> 00:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:45:35.510 --> 00:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
dry uh thank you and thank you for
 
00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:37.109 align:start position:0%
dry uh thank you and thank you for
coming

00:45:37.109 --> 00:45:37.119 align:start position:0%
coming
 
00:45:39.470 --> 00:45:39.480 align:start position:0%
um we talked about the number of
 
00:45:40.910 --> 00:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
students then the doe would be
 
00:45:44.030 --> 00:45:44.040 align:start position:0%
responsible for when from 700 to
 
00:45:46.950 --> 00:45:46.960 align:start position:0%
33,000 is that uh 30 30 around just
 
00:45:49.990 --> 00:45:50.000 align:start position:0%
under 31,000 um just under 31,000 would
 
00:45:53.109 --> 00:45:53.119 align:start position:0%
be the type of um uh students eligible
 
00:45:54.950 --> 00:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
to for the schools to seek reimbursement
 
00:45:56.549 --> 00:45:56.559 align:start position:0%
for okay follow
 
00:45:59.349 --> 00:45:59.359 align:start position:0%
um any idea how much the staff might
 
00:46:01.710 --> 00:46:01.720 align:start position:0%
have to increase to accommodate that
 
00:46:03.950 --> 00:46:03.960 align:start position:0%
it's not my program but I don't have a
 
00:46:06.710 --> 00:46:06.720 align:start position:0%
number okay thank
 
00:46:09.950 --> 00:46:09.960 align:start position:0%
you any further questions thank you very
 
00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:10.910 align:start position:0%
you any further questions thank you very
much

00:46:10.910 --> 00:46:10.920 align:start position:0%
much
 
00:46:22.230 --> 00:46:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:24.790 --> 00:46:24.800 align:start position:0%
up let's talk
 
00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:33.270 align:start position:0%
up let's talk
swep

00:46:33.270 --> 00:46:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:35.230 --> 00:46:35.240 align:start position:0%
once again Dr is here not taking a
 
00:46:37.349 --> 00:46:37.359 align:start position:0%
position it's more technical support for
 
00:46:39.990 --> 00:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
us that is correct uh good morning good
 
00:46:41.790 --> 00:46:41.800 align:start position:0%
morning chairperson and the members of
 
00:46:43.630 --> 00:46:43.640 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Keen mayong tax
 
00:46:45.470 --> 00:46:45.480 align:start position:0%
policy council with the
 
00:46:47.829 --> 00:46:47.839 align:start position:0%
Dr my name is Bruce can I'm the
 
00:46:50.910 --> 00:46:50.920 align:start position:0%
supervisor of the municipal Bureau at
 
00:46:55.030 --> 00:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
Dr um so uh we did prepare a fiscal note
 
00:46:58.150 --> 00:46:58.160 align:start position:0%
um oh yeah yeah yeah as just wanted to
 
00:47:00.510 --> 00:47:00.520 align:start position:0%
repeat what uh representative L was
 
00:47:02.150 --> 00:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
saying that yeah the Dr does not take a
 
00:47:04.549 --> 00:47:04.559 align:start position:0%
position on this bill uh we did prepare
 
00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:06.400 align:start position:0%
a fiscal note uh we were requested to
 
00:47:09.349 --> 00:47:09.359 align:start position:0%
prepare a fiscal note by the LBA um at
 
00:47:10.549 --> 00:47:10.559 align:start position:0%
the time when we prepared the fiscal
 
00:47:14.270 --> 00:47:14.280 align:start position:0%
note we I guess the uh the knowledge on
 
00:47:16.950 --> 00:47:16.960 align:start position:0%
the uh special Aid special education Aid
 
00:47:21.390 --> 00:47:21.400 align:start position:0%
uh was was not as uh um as complete for
 
00:47:23.589 --> 00:47:23.599 align:start position:0%
us at that time uh when we prepared it
 
00:47:26.910 --> 00:47:26.920 align:start position:0%
we put it at $33 million uh we use a $33
 
00:47:28.829 --> 00:47:28.839 align:start position:0%
million budget budgeted special
 
00:47:30.829 --> 00:47:30.839 align:start position:0%
education Aid as the the amount of money
 
00:47:33.750 --> 00:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
to be raised to be added to the swep but
 
00:47:37.549 --> 00:47:37.559 align:start position:0%
hearing from the testimony from Mark is
 
00:47:37.559 --> 00:47:39.270 align:start position:0%
hearing from the testimony from Mark is
$869

00:47:39.270 --> 00:47:39.280 align:start position:0%
$869
 
00:47:42.790 --> 00:47:42.800 align:start position:0%
million um and so our um our
 
00:47:44.870 --> 00:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
understanding is that that $869 million
 
00:47:47.630 --> 00:47:47.640 align:start position:0%
will be added to the $363 million that
 
00:47:50.549 --> 00:47:50.559 align:start position:0%
would be collected through swept um and
 
00:47:54.109 --> 00:47:54.119 align:start position:0%
then that 869 million will be remitted
 
00:47:58.670 --> 00:47:58.680 align:start position:0%
to the Dr and uh transmitt it to the
 
00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
treasury and then to the
 
00:48:02.390 --> 00:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
ETF um
 
00:48:06.990 --> 00:48:07.000 align:start position:0%
the the only potential concerns that the
 
00:48:08.510 --> 00:48:08.520 align:start position:0%
well some of the potential concerns that
 
00:48:11.190 --> 00:48:11.200 align:start position:0%
the Dr has is in terms of uh the timing
 
00:48:14.950 --> 00:48:14.960 align:start position:0%
of things um of um potentially if if
 
00:48:17.109 --> 00:48:17.119 align:start position:0%
that $869 million is that the final
 
00:48:19.790 --> 00:48:19.800 align:start position:0%
number that um that Dr would be adding
 
00:48:23.670 --> 00:48:23.680 align:start position:0%
to the swep uh calculation um if not
 
00:48:25.829 --> 00:48:25.839 align:start position:0%
then we would need to know um what the
 
00:48:27.230 --> 00:48:27.240 align:start position:0%
final number and and the timing of
 
00:48:28.870 --> 00:48:28.880 align:start position:0%
knowing that number so that we can add
 
00:48:32.390 --> 00:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
that to um to our um when we issue the
 
00:48:34.910 --> 00:48:34.920 align:start position:0%
the swep warrant um as well as the
 
00:48:37.589 --> 00:48:37.599 align:start position:0%
timing of when the
 
00:48:40.750 --> 00:48:40.760 align:start position:0%
um a more specific timing of of when the
 
00:48:43.190 --> 00:48:43.200 align:start position:0%
um the municipalities will be remitting
 
00:48:47.790 --> 00:48:47.800 align:start position:0%
the collected um special education uh
 
00:48:50.990 --> 00:48:51.000 align:start position:0%
funding to the Dr to be uh transferred
 
00:48:53.829 --> 00:48:53.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:56.309 --> 00:48:56.319 align:start position:0%
treasury yeah yeah
 
00:48:59.230 --> 00:48:59.240 align:start position:0%
further are there questions from the
 
00:49:01.870 --> 00:49:01.880 align:start position:0%
committee here regarding this
 
00:49:03.710 --> 00:49:03.720 align:start position:0%
process I think we're all trying to
 
00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
filter through
 
00:49:09.390 --> 00:49:09.400 align:start position:0%
this not seeing you thank you very much
 
00:49:11.829 --> 00:49:11.839 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:49:14.589 --> 00:49:14.599 align:start position:0%
y and the last card I have on this is
 
00:49:24.510 --> 00:49:24.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:30.390 align:start position:0%
 
tremble

00:49:30.390 --> 00:49:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:33.109 --> 00:49:33.119 align:start position:0%
good morning again Mr chairman how are
 
00:49:36.549 --> 00:49:36.559 align:start position:0%
you today fine thank you good oh I have
 
00:49:36.559 --> 00:49:45.030 align:start position:0%
you today fine thank you good oh I have
some

00:49:45.030 --> 00:49:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:47.270 --> 00:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
testimony so I had some prepared
 
00:49:49.069 --> 00:49:49.079 align:start position:0%
comments but before I get to them I just
 
00:49:51.270 --> 00:49:51.280 align:start position:0%
wanted to kind of take a step back and
 
00:49:52.710 --> 00:49:52.720 align:start position:0%
look at the comments that were already
 
00:49:55.349 --> 00:49:55.359 align:start position:0%
made three things come to mind first is
 
00:49:57.549 --> 00:49:57.559 align:start position:0%
that that the Constitutional issue and
 
00:50:00.190 --> 00:50:00.200 align:start position:0%
adequacy Claremont says it applies to
 
00:50:03.470 --> 00:50:03.480 align:start position:0%
all children so this statute says that
 
00:50:05.430 --> 00:50:05.440 align:start position:0%
special ed students would need to also
 
00:50:07.190 --> 00:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
get an adequate education I think that's
 
00:50:09.190 --> 00:50:09.200 align:start position:0%
redundant it's not necessary to be in
 
00:50:10.670 --> 00:50:10.680 align:start position:0%
this law because we already have a
 
00:50:12.950 --> 00:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
constitutional duty to provide that to
 
00:50:15.430 --> 00:50:15.440 align:start position:0%
special ed students the second thing was
 
00:50:17.349 --> 00:50:17.359 align:start position:0%
the question of what's the percentages
 
00:50:19.349 --> 00:50:19.359 align:start position:0%
breakdown and this came up last week in
 
00:50:23.630 --> 00:50:23.640 align:start position:0%
the hearing it's 82% local right now 11%
 
00:50:27.030 --> 00:50:27.040 align:start position:0%
State and 7% Federal so out of all sped
 
00:50:29.230 --> 00:50:29.240 align:start position:0%
dollars in New Hampshire the state only
 
00:50:32.390 --> 00:50:32.400 align:start position:0%
pays 11% that's broken down in the two
 
00:50:34.390 --> 00:50:34.400 align:start position:0%
categories the differentiated a which
 
00:50:36.430 --> 00:50:36.440 align:start position:0%
goes out with the adequacy grants is
 
00:50:39.109 --> 00:50:39.119 align:start position:0%
about seven or 8% and the categorical
 
00:50:43.829 --> 00:50:43.839 align:start position:0%
Aid is about 4% so we're paying 11% now
 
00:50:45.990 --> 00:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
this bill would have us pay as a state
 
00:50:48.630 --> 00:50:48.640 align:start position:0%
95% so just to compare last week's bill
 
00:50:50.789 --> 00:50:50.799 align:start position:0%
with this week's Bill last week said
 
00:50:52.430 --> 00:50:52.440 align:start position:0%
let's take the differentiated Aid which
 
00:50:55.030 --> 00:50:55.040 align:start position:0%
we give about 2 or 3,000 per child who
 
00:50:57.190 --> 00:50:57.200 align:start position:0%
has special ed needs and increased that
 
00:50:59.549 --> 00:50:59.559 align:start position:0%
to 28,000 per child so it said let's
 
00:51:01.349 --> 00:51:01.359 align:start position:0%
take that part of our state funding
 
00:51:03.549 --> 00:51:03.559 align:start position:0%
mechanism and put a massive amount of
 
00:51:05.150 --> 00:51:05.160 align:start position:0%
money in so that special that is no
 
00:51:06.990 --> 00:51:07.000 align:start position:0%
longer a burden on the the local
 
00:51:09.030 --> 00:51:09.040 align:start position:0%
government the state would be doing its
 
00:51:11.309 --> 00:51:11.319 align:start position:0%
responsibility under Claremont there
 
00:51:13.470 --> 00:51:13.480 align:start position:0%
this bill takes the other half of our
 
00:51:14.789 --> 00:51:14.799 align:start position:0%
state spending not half the other
 
00:51:16.710 --> 00:51:16.720 align:start position:0%
portion of our state funding categorical
 
00:51:18.430 --> 00:51:18.440 align:start position:0%
Aid and says let's just put all the
 
00:51:20.510 --> 00:51:20.520 align:start position:0%
money through categorical Aid basically
 
00:51:23.549 --> 00:51:23.559 align:start position:0%
just have a revamped massive categorical
 
00:51:25.390 --> 00:51:25.400 align:start position:0%
aid program that we're going to pay $95
 
00:51:27.349 --> 00:51:27.359 align:start position:0%
% no matter what it costs whether it's
 
00:51:29.750 --> 00:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
three and a half times or 10 times your
 
00:51:32.309 --> 00:51:32.319 align:start position:0%
normal student expenditure so but the
 
00:51:35.670 --> 00:51:35.680 align:start position:0%
point is if you commit to Let's fund
 
00:51:38.190 --> 00:51:38.200 align:start position:0%
special education you can do it the way
 
00:51:40.390 --> 00:51:40.400 align:start position:0%
you proposed last week just massively
 
00:51:42.030 --> 00:51:42.040 align:start position:0%
increase the differentiated Aid or you
 
00:51:43.670 --> 00:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
could do it the way this week let's run
 
00:51:45.549 --> 00:51:45.559 align:start position:0%
it through categorical aid but the
 
00:51:48.150 --> 00:51:48.160 align:start position:0%
question is will you commit to massively
 
00:51:49.710 --> 00:51:49.720 align:start position:0%
increasing the state's funding for
 
00:51:51.430 --> 00:51:51.440 align:start position:0%
special education how you choose to go
 
00:51:53.309 --> 00:51:53.319 align:start position:0%
about doing it which Bill obviously
 
00:51:55.910 --> 00:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of technicalities which
 
00:51:57.589 --> 00:51:57.599 align:start position:0%
need to be worked on this legislation
 
00:52:00.270 --> 00:52:00.280 align:start position:0%
could use a bit of work in committee but
 
00:52:01.630 --> 00:52:01.640 align:start position:0%
I think the first question is are you
 
00:52:03.109 --> 00:52:03.119 align:start position:0%
willing to commit to the state funding
 
00:52:05.230 --> 00:52:05.240 align:start position:0%
special and and if so which approach do
 
00:52:06.589 --> 00:52:06.599 align:start position:0%
you prefer do you want to go through a
 
00:52:08.549 --> 00:52:08.559 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid massive increase or
 
00:52:10.510 --> 00:52:10.520 align:start position:0%
do you want to go through a categorical
 
00:52:12.270 --> 00:52:12.280 align:start position:0%
AIDS increase which would be this week
 
00:52:14.349 --> 00:52:14.359 align:start position:0%
so that's and then as far as the federal
 
00:52:16.430 --> 00:52:16.440 align:start position:0%
government it's supposed to pay 40% they
 
00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
said they would do that in 1972 and
 
00:52:19.750 --> 00:52:19.760 align:start position:0%
we've been waiting for them to do it
 
00:52:21.510 --> 00:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
they're a deadbeat parent they're not
 
00:52:23.789 --> 00:52:23.799 align:start position:0%
going to ever do it it's time that we
 
00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
just step up to the plate do it because
 
00:52:27.150 --> 00:52:27.160 align:start position:0%
these are our children these are New
 
00:52:29.230 --> 00:52:29.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire children so I want to add two
 
00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
other things um to the to the agenda
 
00:52:34.069 --> 00:52:34.079 align:start position:0%
here first is that special ed students
 
00:52:36.710 --> 00:52:36.720 align:start position:0%
only receive about 70 or 75% of the
 
00:52:38.150 --> 00:52:38.160 align:start position:0%
services that they're eligible to
 
00:52:39.750 --> 00:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
receive in other words there are unmet
 
00:52:41.109 --> 00:52:41.119 align:start position:0%
special aid
 
00:52:43.750 --> 00:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
needs that's true nationally and at New
 
00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:47.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire there was a study um done
 
00:52:49.510 --> 00:52:49.520 align:start position:0%
nationally found that in public schools
 
00:52:51.150 --> 00:52:51.160 align:start position:0%
and Charter Schools nationally this has
 
00:52:54.150 --> 00:52:54.160 align:start position:0%
receive about 65 to 75% of the necessary
 
00:52:56.150 --> 00:52:56.160 align:start position:0%
funds to cover special Ed programs that
 
00:52:58.190 --> 00:52:58.200 align:start position:0%
was a study done by Claremont Graduate
 
00:53:01.750 --> 00:53:01.760 align:start position:0%
University in New Hampshire um I found a
 
00:53:05.109 --> 00:53:05.119 align:start position:0%
report uh in and it was in the UNR
 
00:53:06.870 --> 00:53:06.880 align:start position:0%
review which cited the New Hampshire
 
00:53:08.549 --> 00:53:08.559 align:start position:0%
School Board Association now this is
 
00:53:11.069 --> 00:53:11.079 align:start position:0%
going back to 2015 but special ed
 
00:53:12.630 --> 00:53:12.640 align:start position:0%
fundings only being funded to
 
00:53:15.190 --> 00:53:15.200 align:start position:0%
approximately 70 to 75% of eligible
 
00:53:17.670 --> 00:53:17.680 align:start position:0%
entitlements so we're not funding
 
00:53:20.670 --> 00:53:20.680 align:start position:0%
special LED fully so if we could make a
 
00:53:22.430 --> 00:53:22.440 align:start position:0%
commitment to it then I think unmet
 
00:53:24.109 --> 00:53:24.119 align:start position:0%
needs would be able to be met because
 
00:53:25.789 --> 00:53:25.799 align:start position:0%
local governments just are unable to
 
00:53:27.750 --> 00:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
meet the entire need the last question
 
00:53:29.510 --> 00:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
is well is it worth it and besides the
 
00:53:31.230 --> 00:53:31.240 align:start position:0%
fact it's our moral duty and our legal
 
00:53:33.390 --> 00:53:33.400 align:start position:0%
Duty it actually produces benefits
 
00:53:35.470 --> 00:53:35.480 align:start position:0%
special Ood funding re produces
 
00:53:38.430 --> 00:53:38.440 align:start position:0%
education gains which produces saving
 
00:53:39.750 --> 00:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
the state money in the long run and you
 
00:53:41.309 --> 00:53:41.319 align:start position:0%
say how could you know that if you don't
 
00:53:43.910 --> 00:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
have a control group it just happened
 
00:53:46.950 --> 00:53:46.960 align:start position:0%
that Texas decided to say only 8 and a
 
00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:49.200 align:start position:0%
half% of students could be special
 
00:53:51.069 --> 00:53:51.079 align:start position:0%
students this was in 2006 they just came
 
00:53:52.549 --> 00:53:52.559 align:start position:0%
up with this number and said that's all
 
00:53:54.589 --> 00:53:54.599 align:start position:0%
we're going to permit you to do they did
 
00:53:55.829 --> 00:53:55.839 align:start position:0%
that for 10 years years the federal
 
00:53:57.270 --> 00:53:57.280 align:start position:0%
government sued them and said you can't
 
00:53:59.789 --> 00:53:59.799 align:start position:0%
do that that's not rational it got
 
00:54:01.390 --> 00:54:01.400 align:start position:0%
overturned but what it did was it
 
00:54:03.390 --> 00:54:03.400 align:start position:0%
created a whole fund of information for
 
00:54:05.109 --> 00:54:05.119 align:start position:0%
social scientists to go back and study
 
00:54:06.549 --> 00:54:06.559 align:start position:0%
and look at it you had you had your
 
00:54:08.950 --> 00:54:08.960 align:start position:0%
perfect control group you could compare
 
00:54:10.950 --> 00:54:10.960 align:start position:0%
what happens to kids who had special ed
 
00:54:13.230 --> 00:54:13.240 align:start position:0%
and those who lost it and what they did
 
00:54:14.990 --> 00:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
so the economists went to work on this
 
00:54:17.230 --> 00:54:17.240 align:start position:0%
and this is from the American Economic
 
00:54:18.309 --> 00:54:18.319 align:start position:0%
Journal in
 
00:54:20.990 --> 00:54:21.000 align:start position:0%
2021 even the students who had minor
 
00:54:22.910 --> 00:54:22.920 align:start position:0%
disabilities had significant increases
 
00:54:24.549 --> 00:54:24.559 align:start position:0%
in their High School completion rates
 
00:54:26.069 --> 00:54:26.079 align:start position:0%
but for students who had more
 
00:54:27.870 --> 00:54:27.880 align:start position:0%
significant disabilities and firm
 
00:54:30.950 --> 00:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
disadvantaged districts the likelihood
 
00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:33.280 align:start position:0%
of completing high school if they lost
 
00:54:35.750 --> 00:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
special ed went down by 52% and the
 
00:54:37.710 --> 00:54:37.720 align:start position:0%
likelihood of going to college went down
 
00:54:40.829 --> 00:54:40.839 align:start position:0%
38% and they say this is because of the
 
00:54:42.710 --> 00:54:42.720 align:start position:0%
services that they received the variety
 
00:54:44.309 --> 00:54:44.319 align:start position:0%
and strength of services that they
 
00:54:46.349 --> 00:54:46.359 align:start position:0%
received and they say conclusion our
 
00:54:47.990 --> 00:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
results suggest there are large
 
00:54:50.349 --> 00:54:50.359 align:start position:0%
meaningful long run returns to investing
 
00:54:52.829 --> 00:54:52.839 align:start position:0%
in special ed services in the public K
 
00:54:54.750 --> 00:54:54.760 align:start position:0%
through2 School setting for students on
 
00:54:56.309 --> 00:54:56.319 align:start position:0%
the mark charge and placement especially
 
00:54:57.589 --> 00:54:57.599 align:start position:0%
those from disadvantaged background so
 
00:54:59.630 --> 00:54:59.640 align:start position:0%
in other words special funding works we
 
00:55:02.789 --> 00:55:02.799 align:start position:0%
know funding Works in general but it's
 
00:55:04.430 --> 00:55:04.440 align:start position:0%
also true of special ed funding so it's
 
00:55:05.750 --> 00:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
something to keep in try so go back to
 
00:55:07.870 --> 00:55:07.880 align:start position:0%
the beginning it's our legal obligation
 
00:55:09.870 --> 00:55:09.880 align:start position:0%
it's our moral obligation it makes sense
 
00:55:11.789 --> 00:55:11.799 align:start position:0%
economically now the only question is
 
00:55:13.430 --> 00:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
are you willing as a state to say we're
 
00:55:15.349 --> 00:55:15.359 align:start position:0%
going to do it and then to decide do you
 
00:55:16.870 --> 00:55:16.880 align:start position:0%
want to do it through differentiated Aid
 
00:55:18.549 --> 00:55:18.559 align:start position:0%
or you want to do it for categorical Aid
 
00:55:20.630 --> 00:55:20.640 align:start position:0%
either pass last week's bill or pass
 
00:55:22.230 --> 00:55:22.240 align:start position:0%
this week's bill but one of these bills
 
00:55:23.390 --> 00:55:23.400 align:start position:0%
should be
 
00:55:25.510 --> 00:55:25.520 align:start position:0%
passed are there question questions for
 
00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:26.470 align:start position:0%
passed are there question questions for
Mr

00:55:26.470 --> 00:55:26.480 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
00:55:29.589 --> 00:55:29.599 align:start position:0%
Trumble yes representative D dry thank
 
00:55:32.029 --> 00:55:32.039 align:start position:0%
you and thank you for coming in want to
 
00:55:34.390 --> 00:55:34.400 align:start position:0%
ask you a philosophical question kind of
 
00:55:36.870 --> 00:55:36.880 align:start position:0%
um there is a resolution right now to
 
00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:40.480 align:start position:0%
ask the uh our federal delegation to
 
00:55:42.950 --> 00:55:42.960 align:start position:0%
look into fully funding the special ed
 
00:55:44.670 --> 00:55:44.680 align:start position:0%
things but in the meantime we're
 
00:55:47.029 --> 00:55:47.039 align:start position:0%
following all the requirements but only
 
00:55:49.549 --> 00:55:49.559 align:start position:0%
getting less than half the the
 
00:55:53.230 --> 00:55:53.240 align:start position:0%
reimbursement that we're entitled to is
 
00:55:57.630 --> 00:55:57.640 align:start position:0%
it moral kind for us to to disregard
 
00:56:00.390 --> 00:56:00.400 align:start position:0%
their uh requirements because sometimes
 
00:56:02.510 --> 00:56:02.520 align:start position:0%
those are honorous and expensive and
 
00:56:04.670 --> 00:56:04.680 align:start position:0%
maybe not necessary um because they're
 
00:56:05.870 --> 00:56:05.880 align:start position:0%
not fulfilling their side of the
 
00:56:07.670 --> 00:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
contract why do we have to jump through
 
00:56:10.390 --> 00:56:10.400 align:start position:0%
the Hoops that we do to get that money
 
00:56:12.230 --> 00:56:12.240 align:start position:0%
because of the children I mean it it's
 
00:56:14.710 --> 00:56:14.720 align:start position:0%
they have a right under federal law we
 
00:56:17.230 --> 00:56:17.240 align:start position:0%
have a constitutional that requirement
 
00:56:18.950 --> 00:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
that every child should get an adequate
 
00:56:21.270 --> 00:56:21.280 align:start position:0%
education it's our responsibility and
 
00:56:23.390 --> 00:56:23.400 align:start position:0%
the federal government has not lived up
 
00:56:26.230 --> 00:56:26.240 align:start position:0%
to its share of the deal for 50 years
 
00:56:28.789 --> 00:56:28.799 align:start position:0%
and waiting for them to finally show up
 
00:56:30.670 --> 00:56:30.680 align:start position:0%
is ridiculous they're not they're not
 
00:56:32.270 --> 00:56:32.280 align:start position:0%
going to come or even if they do come
 
00:56:35.270 --> 00:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
then we can go back and re re whichever
 
00:56:36.589 --> 00:56:36.599 align:start position:0%
one of these bills you passed you could
 
00:56:37.870 --> 00:56:37.880 align:start position:0%
go back and say yay the federal
 
00:56:39.470 --> 00:56:39.480 align:start position:0%
government finally spent some money and
 
00:56:41.349 --> 00:56:41.359 align:start position:0%
then reduce the state share but waiting
 
00:56:43.829 --> 00:56:43.839 align:start position:0%
for them is not a good policy let's
 
00:56:46.430 --> 00:56:46.440 align:start position:0%
let's fund it now if they do eventually
 
00:56:47.710 --> 00:56:47.720 align:start position:0%
come up with more money then we can
 
00:56:49.390 --> 00:56:49.400 align:start position:0%
reduce the cost through either of the
 
00:56:51.309 --> 00:56:51.319 align:start position:0%
bills but sitting and doing nothing
 
00:56:52.950 --> 00:56:52.960 align:start position:0%
because they might show up again
 
00:56:54.549 --> 00:56:54.559 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the next 50 years I think
 
00:56:56.029 --> 00:56:56.039 align:start position:0%
that that would be unfair to the
 
00:56:58.230 --> 00:56:58.240 align:start position:0%
children just follow up yes yeah I
 
00:57:00.230 --> 00:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
wasn't suggesting we not do anything I
 
00:57:04.069 --> 00:57:04.079 align:start position:0%
was saying do you are you are you saying
 
00:57:06.109 --> 00:57:06.119 align:start position:0%
we continue with um as if they were
 
00:57:08.589 --> 00:57:08.599 align:start position:0%
refunding us completely and getting just
 
00:57:10.510 --> 00:57:10.520 align:start position:0%
accepting that it's less than half of
 
00:57:12.470 --> 00:57:12.480 align:start position:0%
what we are we're entitled to yeah I I
 
00:57:14.829 --> 00:57:14.839 align:start position:0%
think we have to continue to to fund
 
00:57:16.870 --> 00:57:16.880 align:start position:0%
special ed and I think the the people
 
00:57:18.589 --> 00:57:18.599 align:start position:0%
who work in special ed know that every
 
00:57:20.309 --> 00:57:20.319 align:start position:0%
day when the question was asked how did
 
00:57:22.230 --> 00:57:22.240 align:start position:0%
the IEPs come up the child comes into
 
00:57:23.750 --> 00:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
the district the principal and the
 
00:57:25.670 --> 00:57:25.680 align:start position:0%
special ed directors say and say okay we
 
00:57:27.950 --> 00:57:27.960 align:start position:0%
have a new child what are their
 
00:57:29.630 --> 00:57:29.640 align:start position:0%
disabilities who are the experts
 
00:57:31.029 --> 00:57:31.039 align:start position:0%
involved in this field let's sit down
 
00:57:32.510 --> 00:57:32.520 align:start position:0%
and come up with a plan by law they have
 
00:57:34.069 --> 00:57:34.079 align:start position:0%
so many so many days to come up with the
 
00:57:35.510 --> 00:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
plan or they're out of compliance and
 
00:57:38.309 --> 00:57:38.319 align:start position:0%
then they they do it and so we have to
 
00:57:39.670 --> 00:57:39.680 align:start position:0%
continue doing that I I don't think
 
00:57:43.309 --> 00:57:43.319 align:start position:0%
there's any other realistic Choice okay
 
00:57:45.069 --> 00:57:45.079 align:start position:0%

State investment in a farm to school
 
01:01:09.309 --> 01:01:09.319 align:start position:0%
program that school districts across the

feedback from this committee and
 
01:01:15.349 --> 01:01:15.359 align:start position:0%
conversations with the Department of

Agriculture we have come back this year
 
01:01:19.789 --> 01:01:19.799 align:start position:0%
to ask first for the development of a
 
01:01:22.069 --> 01:01:22.079 align:start position:0%
pilot program to help assess the
 
01:01:24.069 --> 01:01:24.079 align:start position:0%
feasibility of a local food incentive

program
 
01:01:26.990 --> 01:01:27.000 align:start position:0%
before attempting a program that would
 
01:01:29.309 --> 01:01:29.319 align:start position:0%
allow access to all schools school

across the state local food nourishes
 
01:01:39.789 --> 01:01:39.799 align:start position:0%
children supports local farmers and
 
01:01:41.870 --> 01:01:41.880 align:start position:0%
strengthens the resiliency of our supply
 
01:01:43.549 --> 01:01:43.559 align:start position:0%
chain in many
 
01:01:45.390 --> 01:01:45.400 align:start position:0%
communities however there are currently
 
01:01:46.829 --> 01:01:46.839 align:start position:0%
schools across the state who would like
 
01:01:48.589 --> 01:01:48.599 align:start position:0%
to get involved with the farm to school
 
01:01:51.029 --> 01:01:51.039 align:start position:0%
program who need encouragement fiscally
 
01:01:54.109 --> 01:01:54.119 align:start position:0%
and operationally the pirate pilot
 
01:01:55.950 --> 01:01:55.960 align:start position:0%
program program would allow one school
 
01:01:58.230 --> 01:01:58.240 align:start position:0%
district in each of our 10 counties to
 
01:02:00.750 --> 01:02:00.760 align:start position:0%

who will put together a committee and
 
01:02:06.109 --> 01:02:06.119 align:start position:0%
criteria to choose schools to
 
01:02:08.510 --> 01:02:08.520 align:start position:0%
participate in the pilot program the
 
01:02:10.150 --> 01:02:10.160 align:start position:0%
department will also gather data from
 
01:02:12.710 --> 01:02:12.720 align:start position:0%
the pilot program in order to discern if
 
01:02:14.789 --> 01:02:14.799 align:start position:0%
and how to best go about a farm to
 
01:02:17.510 --> 01:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
school incentive program that would be
 
01:02:20.190 --> 01:02:20.200 align:start position:0%
accessible to all schools across the
 
01:02:22.390 --> 01:02:22.400 align:start position:0%

Secretary of Agriculture Tom vilsack
 
01:02:26.990 --> 01:02:27.000 align:start position:0%
spoke here in New Hampshire he described
 
01:02:28.510 --> 01:02:28.520 align:start position:0%
the many ways that we can support
 
01:02:30.430 --> 01:02:30.440 align:start position:0%
farming and Rural communities in New
 
01:02:32.870 --> 01:02:32.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire one of the one of the ways we
 
01:02:34.990 --> 01:02:35.000 align:start position:0%
can do this is by investing in our local
 
01:02:37.630 --> 01:02:37.640 align:start position:0%
and Regional Food Systems investment in
 
01:02:39.309 --> 01:02:39.319 align:start position:0%
the farm to school programs is an
 
01:02:41.870 --> 01:02:41.880 align:start position:0%
investment in our economy investing in
 
01:02:44.109 --> 01:02:44.119 align:start position:0%
our local and Regional Food Systems
 
01:02:46.670 --> 01:02:46.680 align:start position:0%
especially our rural economy makes a big
 
01:02:48.870 --> 01:02:48.880 align:start position:0%
difference in the economic viability of
 
01:02:51.390 --> 01:02:51.400 align:start position:0%
our small and medium-sized Farms
 
01:02:53.510 --> 01:02:53.520 align:start position:0%
especially not only can we help our
 
01:02:55.549 --> 01:02:55.559 align:start position:0%
rural economy but we can also improve
 
01:02:57.069 --> 01:02:57.079 align:start position:0%
the health and well-being of our
 
01:02:59.150 --> 01:02:59.160 align:start position:0%
children and the resiliency of our local
 
01:03:02.029 --> 01:03:02.039 align:start position:0%
food system a robust Farm to school
 
01:03:03.589 --> 01:03:03.599 align:start position:0%
program will help strengthen New
 
01:03:05.829 --> 01:03:05.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's agricultural sector and
 
01:03:09.710 --> 01:03:09.720 align:start position:0%

and was able to share with us here are
 
01:04:32.549 --> 01:04:32.559 align:start position:0%
the things that are working here are the
 
01:04:33.829 --> 01:04:33.839 align:start position:0%
things that would be a challenge for
 
01:04:37.870 --> 01:04:37.880 align:start position:0%
your state to try to help us have um the
 
01:04:40.829 --> 01:04:40.839 align:start position:0%
tools that we need to you know even with
 
01:04:43.109 --> 01:04:43.119 align:start position:0%
a pilot program we want it to be as
 
01:04:46.990 --> 01:04:47.000 align:start position:0%
smooth a roll out as possible um so our
 
01:04:50.549 --> 01:04:50.559 align:start position:0%
neighbors in Vermont and Maine um have
 
01:04:52.430 --> 01:04:52.440 align:start position:0%
robust programs that we've spoken to
 
01:04:55.470 --> 01:04:55.480 align:start position:0%
their um Administration their directors
 
01:04:58.190 --> 01:04:58.200 align:start position:0%
as well thank you yeah further questions
 
01:05:00.150 --> 01:05:00.160 align:start position:0%
from the committee yes representative
 
01:05:02.230 --> 01:05:02.240 align:start position:0%
Pell thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:05:04.630 --> 01:05:04.640 align:start position:0%
for taking my question how many schools
 
01:05:07.390 --> 01:05:07.400 align:start position:0%
across the state have requested this
 
01:05:09.670 --> 01:05:09.680 align:start position:0%
program I'm afraid that's a technical
 
01:05:12.630 --> 01:05:12.640 align:start position:0%
question I'm not able to answer I I
 
01:05:15.710 --> 01:05:15.720 align:start position:0%
would think that um Stacy Perlo who
 
01:05:16.990 --> 01:05:17.000 align:start position:0%
directs the program would have more
 
01:05:18.710 --> 01:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
information on that thank
 
01:05:22.150 --> 01:05:22.160 align:start position:0%
you yes represent Boney thank you Mr
 
01:05:23.430 --> 01:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:05:25.990 --> 01:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
question um on the expenditures that I
 
01:05:28.309 --> 01:05:28.319 align:start position:0%
see the
 
01:05:30.470 --> 01:05:30.480 align:start position:0%
um the
 
01:05:33.990 --> 01:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
$120,000 is that uh to be applied uh for
 
01:05:36.789 --> 01:05:36.799 align:start position:0%
the uh reimbursements
 
01:05:40.109 --> 01:05:40.119 align:start position:0%
alone yes I believe in the fiscal note
 
01:05:41.789 --> 01:05:41.799 align:start position:0%
it says that
 
01:05:45.870 --> 01:05:45.880 align:start position:0%
um the bill appropriates yeah exactly um
 
01:05:48.309 --> 01:05:48.319 align:start position:0%
I think also it will be helpful for you
 
01:05:51.870 --> 01:05:51.880 align:start position:0%
to we have um uh a representative from
 
01:05:53.430 --> 01:05:53.440 align:start position:0%
the Department of Agriculture market and
 
01:05:55.549 --> 01:05:55.559 align:start position:0%
Foods here who will speak to that as
 
01:05:58.789 --> 01:05:58.799 align:start position:0%
well um because they are already working
 
01:06:01.069 --> 01:06:01.079 align:start position:0%
on a particular Cooperative agreement
 
01:06:04.269 --> 01:06:04.279 align:start position:0%
around Farm to school so thank you yeah
 
01:06:06.269 --> 01:06:06.279 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
01:06:08.430 --> 01:06:08.440 align:start position:0%
represent beler represent Miler after
 
01:06:10.589 --> 01:06:10.599 align:start position:0%
represent Belcher thank you Mr chair and
 
01:06:12.269 --> 01:06:12.279 align:start position:0%
thank you for bringing this bill forward
 
01:06:14.990 --> 01:06:15.000 align:start position:0%
um I really don't dislike the underlying
 
01:06:16.430 --> 01:06:16.440 align:start position:0%
concept I like the idea of supporting
 
01:06:19.510 --> 01:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
local farms I have a couple of questions
 
01:06:23.150 --> 01:06:23.160 align:start position:0%
um about the particulars in this um
 
01:06:24.870 --> 01:06:24.880 align:start position:0%
because this is all new money being
 
01:06:27.390 --> 01:06:27.400 align:start position:0%
expended toward this pilot program it's
 
01:06:29.069 --> 01:06:29.079 align:start position:0%
um I don't believe that's going to be
 
01:06:33.150 --> 01:06:33.160 align:start position:0%
reimbursable so why is it that we would
 
01:06:35.870 --> 01:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
exclude any school not participating in
 
01:06:38.630 --> 01:06:38.640 align:start position:0%
the free lunch program the USDA program
 
01:06:41.349 --> 01:06:41.359 align:start position:0%
as well as require USDA mandates be
 
01:06:43.349 --> 01:06:43.359 align:start position:0%
followed instead of setting up our own
 
01:06:46.230 --> 01:06:46.240 align:start position:0%
and taking this at the state
 
01:06:49.990 --> 01:06:50.000 align:start position:0%
level so I'm going to let Stacy purlo
 
01:06:52.109 --> 01:06:52.119 align:start position:0%
take that question who works with um the
 
01:06:54.829 --> 01:06:54.839 align:start position:0%
USDA closely she will have more
 
01:06:58.190 --> 01:06:58.200 align:start position:0%
information about how the um the
 
01:06:58.200 --> 01:07:00.029 align:start position:0%
information about how the um the
programs

01:07:00.029 --> 01:07:00.039 align:start position:0%
programs
 
01:07:03.230 --> 01:07:03.240 align:start position:0%
interact if I may just one similar but
 
01:07:04.990 --> 01:07:05.000 align:start position:0%
not quite the same I mean just looking
 
01:07:07.430 --> 01:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
at the nutritional items in here and
 
01:07:09.670 --> 01:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
what is included and what's excluded can
 
01:07:12.230 --> 01:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
you tell me why it would specifically
 
01:07:15.349 --> 01:07:15.359 align:start position:0%
include maple syrup which is I don't
 
01:07:16.789 --> 01:07:16.799 align:start position:0%
know if it's particularly healthy and
 
01:07:20.549 --> 01:07:20.559 align:start position:0%
it's quite expensive but it excludes
 
01:07:23.510 --> 01:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
milk um sure so we've had a lot of
 
01:07:25.589 --> 01:07:25.599 align:start position:0%
convers ations over the years about
 
01:07:27.950 --> 01:07:27.960 align:start position:0%
these things I'm going to do my best and
 
01:07:32.190 --> 01:07:32.200 align:start position:0%
then allow um others to fill in um any
 
01:07:34.029 --> 01:07:34.039 align:start position:0%
gaps in knowledge but I believe with the
 
01:07:36.630 --> 01:07:36.640 align:start position:0%
school breakfast program there are often
 
01:07:40.630 --> 01:07:40.640 align:start position:0%
foods that um have syrup involved with
 
01:07:43.589 --> 01:07:43.599 align:start position:0%
them and we would um prefer that they
 
01:07:47.510 --> 01:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
use um and buy a syrup that we produce
 
01:07:50.109 --> 01:07:50.119 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire and support our
 
01:07:55.390 --> 01:07:55.400 align:start position:0%
maple syrup farming industry and not um
 
01:07:55.400 --> 01:07:57.190 align:start position:0%
maple syrup farming industry and not um
uh

01:07:57.190 --> 01:07:57.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:08:01.390 --> 01:08:01.400 align:start position:0%
ship non- maple syrup from other places
 
01:08:04.150 --> 01:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
across the country um so that's the
 
01:08:09.390 --> 01:08:09.400 align:start position:0%
maple syrup uh question and then um uh
 
01:08:12.789 --> 01:08:12.799 align:start position:0%
fluid milk so we found through the
 
01:08:14.670 --> 01:08:14.680 align:start position:0%
research that we did with the help from
 
01:08:16.390 --> 01:08:16.400 align:start position:0%
the and I'm sorry I can't remember her
 
01:08:21.309 --> 01:08:21.319 align:start position:0%
name right now um the uh a tough student
 
01:08:23.550 --> 01:08:23.560 align:start position:0%
but we were able to look at what other
 
01:08:25.749 --> 01:08:25.759 align:start position:0%
St have done and one of the challenges
 
01:08:28.590 --> 01:08:28.600 align:start position:0%
theyve found is that if you include
 
01:08:31.510 --> 01:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
fluid milk in the reimbursement program
 
01:08:35.630 --> 01:08:35.640 align:start position:0%
then that um completely consumes the the
 
01:08:37.510 --> 01:08:37.520 align:start position:0%
reimbursement program because you have
 
01:08:40.709 --> 01:08:40.719 align:start position:0%
fluid milk at every um every meal I
 
01:08:44.870 --> 01:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
believe and so in order to try to reach
 
01:08:47.030 --> 01:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
the goals of the program which is to
 
01:08:50.829 --> 01:08:50.839 align:start position:0%
support um the food system broadly and
 
01:08:53.349 --> 01:08:53.359 align:start position:0%
to increase our resiliency in our food
 
01:08:53.359 --> 01:08:54.470 align:start position:0%
to increase our resiliency in our food
security

01:08:54.470 --> 01:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
security
 
01:08:57.550 --> 01:08:57.560 align:start position:0%
we are already purchasing um a lot a lot
 
01:08:59.990 --> 01:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
of places already purchasing um fluid
 
01:09:03.229 --> 01:09:03.239 align:start position:0%
milk but it would be important to also
 
01:09:05.709 --> 01:09:05.719 align:start position:0%
include these other um range of
 
01:09:07.630 --> 01:09:07.640 align:start position:0%
vegetables and fruits and ciders and
 
01:09:12.030 --> 01:09:12.040 align:start position:0%
meats and fish um to build that
 
01:09:15.669 --> 01:09:15.679 align:start position:0%
whole local and Regional food
 
01:09:17.550 --> 01:09:17.560 align:start position:0%
web thank you are there further
 
01:09:19.749 --> 01:09:19.759 align:start position:0%
questions represent Miler uh thank you
 
01:09:21.229 --> 01:09:21.239 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you for being here
 
01:09:24.269 --> 01:09:24.279 align:start position:0%
bringing this before us did I hear you
 
01:09:25.910 --> 01:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
did I hear correctly say that there
 
01:09:28.550 --> 01:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
currently are some programs in school
 
01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:30.110 align:start position:0%
currently are some programs in school
districts

01:09:30.110 --> 01:09:30.120 align:start position:0%
districts
 
01:09:33.030 --> 01:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
already yes absolutely thank you for the
 
01:09:35.990 --> 01:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
question representative Miler there are
 
01:09:38.110 --> 01:09:38.120 align:start position:0%
um a number of schools across the state
 
01:09:40.550 --> 01:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
who are doing um Farm to school
 
01:09:43.110 --> 01:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
purchasing um including I live in exer
 
01:09:46.550 --> 01:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
and we um ourselves have been doing Farm
 
01:09:48.269 --> 01:09:48.279 align:start position:0%
to school purchasing
 
01:09:51.870 --> 01:09:51.880 align:start position:0%
since um my oldest is in his first year
 
01:09:54.669 --> 01:09:54.679 align:start position:0%
in college and when he went into to
 
01:09:57.590 --> 01:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
kindergarten I volunteered to broker the
 
01:09:59.470 --> 01:09:59.480 align:start position:0%
first sale of carrots to our local
 
01:10:01.550 --> 01:10:01.560 align:start position:0%
school district with a farmer that I
 
01:10:03.990 --> 01:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
knew who had extra carrots and so how
 
01:10:07.070 --> 01:10:07.080 align:start position:0%
many years is that we've been doing it
 
01:10:11.470 --> 01:10:11.480 align:start position:0%
in exiter for 13 14 something like that
 
01:10:14.070 --> 01:10:14.080 align:start position:0%
years so a followup please yes so how
 
01:10:16.229 --> 01:10:16.239 align:start position:0%
does this how does this program work I I
 
01:10:18.910 --> 01:10:18.920 align:start position:0%
mean you obviously the carrot is one
 
01:10:23.070 --> 01:10:23.080 align:start position:0%
example but what's the dynamic around
 
01:10:26.189 --> 01:10:26.199 align:start position:0%
how this whole program would work sure
 
01:10:28.830 --> 01:10:28.840 align:start position:0%
so the carrot is a very basic example
 
01:10:33.669 --> 01:10:33.679 align:start position:0%
very early on in a program um and it
 
01:10:36.470 --> 01:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
really schools School nutrition
 
01:10:39.229 --> 01:10:39.239 align:start position:0%
directors are able
 
01:10:42.669 --> 01:10:42.679 align:start position:0%
to um do the program however works best
 
01:10:45.470 --> 01:10:45.480 align:start position:0%
for them so different depending on where
 
01:10:48.030 --> 01:10:48.040 align:start position:0%
you live across the state there might be
 
01:10:50.030 --> 01:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
different local foods that are available
 
01:10:52.030 --> 01:10:52.040 align:start position:0%
more easily to you like on the Sea Coast
 
01:10:55.750 --> 01:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
you might have more fish available or um
 
01:10:58.830 --> 01:10:58.840 align:start position:0%
I know our food service director drives
 
01:11:00.870 --> 01:11:00.880 align:start position:0%
from her region is able to pick up more
 
01:11:04.669 --> 01:11:04.679 align:start position:0%
apples from there um so it does vary
 
01:11:07.270 --> 01:11:07.280 align:start position:0%
from place to place it also varies with
 
01:11:10.310 --> 01:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
how the Food Service directors um work
 
01:11:12.830 --> 01:11:12.840 align:start position:0%
with their colleagues to do um sometimes
 
01:11:16.709 --> 01:11:16.719 align:start position:0%
they'll do uh programs special programs
 
01:11:18.510 --> 01:11:18.520 align:start position:0%
like try it Tuesday where the food
 
01:11:20.189 --> 01:11:20.199 align:start position:0%
service director will pick a vegetable
 
01:11:23.110 --> 01:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
that that she knows students have never
 
01:11:25.390 --> 01:11:25.400 align:start position:0%
had before for and will they'll just do
 
01:11:27.070 --> 01:11:27.080 align:start position:0%
a special program where all the kids get
 
01:11:28.709 --> 01:11:28.719 align:start position:0%
a little cup of that vegetable and
 
01:11:32.470 --> 01:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
that's what they get to try that day um
 
01:11:35.270 --> 01:11:35.280 align:start position:0%
and so it sometimes has a curricular
 
01:11:38.110 --> 01:11:38.120 align:start position:0%
component or a garden component but this
 
01:11:41.189 --> 01:11:41.199 align:start position:0%
this build this pilot program and the
 
01:11:43.669 --> 01:11:43.679 align:start position:0%
the meat and potatoes of the farm to
 
01:11:45.990 --> 01:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
school program is connecting with
 
01:11:48.270 --> 01:11:48.280 align:start position:0%
farmers in your local area and having
 
01:11:52.550 --> 01:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
the foods that they grow and um and
 
01:11:56.990 --> 01:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
produce be available to your school um
 
01:12:00.270 --> 01:12:00.280 align:start position:0%
and I know last time that um she
 
01:12:02.550 --> 01:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
testified Stacy plea was able to share
 
01:12:04.669 --> 01:12:04.679 align:start position:0%
with us more broadly kind of what the
 
01:12:07.669 --> 01:12:07.679 align:start position:0%
farm to school program does so she might
 
01:12:10.910 --> 01:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
also have more to add here follow yes uh
 
01:12:13.870 --> 01:12:13.880 align:start position:0%
so the purchase of the local product are
 
01:12:15.750 --> 01:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
they at market price are they at a
 
01:12:19.550 --> 01:12:19.560 align:start position:0%
discount price or how does that
 
01:12:23.910 --> 01:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
work I think I think it depends so I
 
01:12:27.229 --> 01:12:27.239 align:start position:0%
don't really have data on
 
01:12:30.709 --> 01:12:30.719 align:start position:0%
that hopefully someone behind me can
 
01:12:34.350 --> 01:12:34.360 align:start position:0%
help with that is um sorry further
 
01:12:37.390 --> 01:12:37.400 align:start position:0%
questions representa Pell thank you Mr
 
01:12:38.790 --> 01:12:38.800 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:12:40.950 --> 01:12:40.960 align:start position:0%
question have there been any studies on
 
01:12:43.550 --> 01:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
the eyesight of the students in exiter
 
01:12:45.830 --> 01:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
with the carrot program I'm sorry I just
 
01:12:47.750 --> 01:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
couldn't help
 
01:12:50.149 --> 01:12:50.159 align:start position:0%
myself any other questions from the
 
01:12:52.790 --> 01:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
committee thank you very much and you're
 
01:12:54.750 --> 01:12:54.760 align:start position:0%
welcome thank thank you appreciate it uh
 
01:12:56.550 --> 01:12:56.560 align:start position:0%
as we've had policy in the past in
 
01:12:58.030 --> 01:12:58.040 align:start position:0%
various bills because the number of
 
01:13:00.430 --> 01:13:00.440 align:start position:0%
cards put the two-minute rule in for
 
01:13:02.870 --> 01:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
those the the prime sponsors always
 
01:13:05.830 --> 01:13:05.840 align:start position:0%
given more latitude and the those that
 
01:13:07.550 --> 01:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
are co-sponsors or others who want to
 
01:13:09.790 --> 01:13:09.800 align:start position:0%
speak to it two minutes and we will have
 
01:13:11.390 --> 01:13:11.400 align:start position:0%
the timers going so I'd like to have
 
01:13:17.110 --> 01:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:19.950 --> 01:13:19.960 align:start position:0%
torski thank you Mr chairman I will be I
 
01:13:22.149 --> 01:13:22.159 align:start position:0%
will be within my two minutes if not
 
01:13:23.870 --> 01:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
briefer um
 
01:13:26.750 --> 01:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
I'm here not as an expert on the farm to
 
01:13:29.310 --> 01:13:29.320 align:start position:0%
school program but simply as a believer
 
01:13:31.910 --> 01:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
in the advantages of connecting farms
 
01:13:33.669 --> 01:13:33.679 align:start position:0%
and small producers with our local
 
01:13:35.750 --> 01:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
communities and school
 
01:13:38.149 --> 01:13:38.159 align:start position:0%
districts this program would benefit our
 
01:13:40.310 --> 01:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
agricultural sector benefit our school
 
01:13:43.950 --> 01:13:43.960 align:start position:0%
children who may not have the ability to
 
01:13:47.709 --> 01:13:47.719 align:start position:0%
access local products and local produce
 
01:13:50.350 --> 01:13:50.360 align:start position:0%
as we know introducing foods to young
 
01:13:52.790 --> 01:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
children builds a strong foundation for
 
01:13:54.669 --> 01:13:54.679 align:start position:0%
a lifelong healthy
 
01:13:57.590 --> 01:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
eating I actually represent NASA's w 8
 
01:14:00.310 --> 01:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
which I neglected to mention um but in
 
01:14:03.390 --> 01:14:03.400 align:start position:0%
nasua I would encourage any opportunity
 
01:14:05.550 --> 01:14:05.560 align:start position:0%
to bring healthy choices to our lower
 
01:14:08.669 --> 01:14:08.679 align:start position:0%
income students for many students in my
 
01:14:11.590 --> 01:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
city this program could be their only
 
01:14:14.390 --> 01:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
chance to partake in Local Foods and the
 
01:14:16.470 --> 01:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
programming possibilities that repr
 
01:14:18.870 --> 01:14:18.880 align:start position:0%
representative Simpson just outlined
 
01:14:21.229 --> 01:14:21.239 align:start position:0%
could probably be their first connection
 
01:14:24.470 --> 01:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
with how foods are grown
 
01:14:27.709 --> 01:14:27.719 align:start position:0%
this is really a winwin win a win
 
01:14:29.950 --> 01:14:29.960 align:start position:0%
because it's a pilot where we can
 
01:14:32.470 --> 01:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
evaluate how it works knock out the
 
01:14:34.750 --> 01:14:34.760 align:start position:0%
positives and the negatives it's a win
 
01:14:37.310 --> 01:14:37.320 align:start position:0%
for our farms and small food
 
01:14:40.189 --> 01:14:40.199 align:start position:0%
producers it's a win for our schools and
 
01:14:42.950 --> 01:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
it's a win for our students I'll end
 
01:14:44.669 --> 01:14:44.679 align:start position:0%
there but I thank all of you for your
 
01:14:46.149 --> 01:14:46.159 align:start position:0%
consideration and represent
 
01:14:47.709 --> 01:14:47.719 align:start position:0%
representative Simpson for her work on
 
01:14:49.110 --> 01:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
this Bill thank you very much are there
 
01:14:51.390 --> 01:14:51.400 align:start position:0%
any questions from the
 
01:14:56.189 --> 01:14:56.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:58.870 --> 01:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
okay uh next one is Joshua Marshall from
 
01:15:01.030 --> 01:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Department of uh food
 
01:15:07.470 --> 01:15:07.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:09.590 --> 01:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
agriculture good morning uh for the
 
01:15:11.430 --> 01:15:11.440 align:start position:0%
record Josh Marshall director of the
 
01:15:13.030 --> 01:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
division of agricultural development for
 
01:15:13.990 --> 01:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Department of
 
01:15:16.830 --> 01:15:16.840 align:start position:0%
Agriculture markets and food uh I'm here
 
01:15:19.910 --> 01:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
to provide some information um on behalf
 
01:15:21.270 --> 01:15:21.280 align:start position:0%
of the department we're not taking a
 
01:15:23.430 --> 01:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
position on the bill but um some
 
01:15:25.110 --> 01:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
information on our ability to administer
 
01:15:27.149 --> 01:15:27.159 align:start position:0%
it and our experience with a very
 
01:15:30.750 --> 01:15:30.760 align:start position:0%
similar bill um through the F through
 
01:15:33.390 --> 01:15:33.400 align:start position:0%
USDA um we currently administer the
 
01:15:34.910 --> 01:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
local food for school Cooperative
 
01:15:37.709 --> 01:15:37.719 align:start position:0%
agreement which is federally funded we
 
01:15:37.719 --> 01:15:52.189 align:start position:0%
agreement which is federally funded we
received

01:15:52.189 --> 01:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:55.750 --> 01:15:55.760 align:start position:0%
$58,900 agreements uh for
 
01:15:59.669 --> 01:15:59.679 align:start position:0%
$188,400 180 with several more in the
 
01:16:01.790 --> 01:16:01.800 align:start position:0%
pipeline expect to have about
 
01:16:04.149 --> 01:16:04.159 align:start position:0%
$250,000 in funding going directly to
 
01:16:05.990 --> 01:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
schools for something very similar to
 
01:16:07.870 --> 01:16:07.880 align:start position:0%
this where their requirements are to
 
01:16:10.430 --> 01:16:10.440 align:start position:0%
purchase local and Regional minimally
 
01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:11.870 align:start position:0%
purchase local and Regional minimally
processed

01:16:11.870 --> 01:16:11.880 align:start position:0%
processed
 
01:16:15.270 --> 01:16:15.280 align:start position:0%
food um so I'm very confident in our
 
01:16:17.590 --> 01:16:17.600 align:start position:0%
capacity to administer the program
 
01:16:19.470 --> 01:16:19.480 align:start position:0%
within the funding level that's in the
 
01:16:21.669 --> 01:16:21.679 align:start position:0%
bill and with a smaller number of
 
01:16:23.990 --> 01:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
schools with a maximum of 10 schools in
 
01:16:26.270 --> 01:16:26.280 align:start position:0%
this bill we have up to 40 that could
 
01:16:28.110 --> 01:16:28.120 align:start position:0%
have participated through the uh
 
01:16:29.709 --> 01:16:29.719 align:start position:0%
federally funded
 
01:16:32.629 --> 01:16:32.639 align:start position:0%
program um yeah I think a couple other
 
01:16:36.510 --> 01:16:36.520 align:start position:0%
things that I noticed um line 24 and 25
 
01:16:39.870 --> 01:16:39.880 align:start position:0%
of page one mentioning the ability to
 
01:16:42.310 --> 01:16:42.320 align:start position:0%
purchase kitchen equipment specifically
 
01:16:43.990 --> 01:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
for use in processing cooking and
 
01:16:46.470 --> 01:16:46.480 align:start position:0%
storing and serving local food would
 
01:16:49.270 --> 01:16:49.280 align:start position:0%
make it very easy for the schools to
 
01:16:51.950 --> 01:16:51.960 align:start position:0%
expend what they would get if 10 schools
 
01:16:53.470 --> 01:16:53.480 align:start position:0%
get funding it would be a little over
 
01:16:55.510 --> 01:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
$10,000 per school and that would be
 
01:16:57.470 --> 01:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
pretty easy if they only purchased
 
01:17:00.310 --> 01:17:00.320 align:start position:0%
equipment um but there's also a a bounty
 
01:17:02.310 --> 01:17:02.320 align:start position:0%
of local products available in the
 
01:17:05.910 --> 01:17:05.920 align:start position:0%
region for them to purchase their um
 
01:17:07.189 --> 01:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
over a little over
 
01:17:09.910 --> 01:17:09.920 align:start position:0%
$10,000 uh would not be a hard
 
01:17:14.310 --> 01:17:14.320 align:start position:0%
lift um some of the issues that oh
 
01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:18.070 align:start position:0%
lift um some of the issues that oh
that's

01:17:18.070 --> 01:17:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:20.390 --> 01:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
it we're right at the end of that if you
 
01:17:22.350 --> 01:17:22.360 align:start position:0%
have a few more all I just going to say
 
01:17:23.910 --> 01:17:23.920 align:start position:0%
some of the issues we faced with
 
01:17:25.590 --> 01:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
administering the program right now why
 
01:17:28.590 --> 01:17:28.600 align:start position:0%
I think there's a a a lower turnout in
 
01:17:31.550 --> 01:17:31.560 align:start position:0%
participation is the capacity uh for
 
01:17:33.510 --> 01:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
Food Service directors uh to do the
 
01:17:36.430 --> 01:17:36.440 align:start position:0%
paperwork and the reporting um Staffing
 
01:17:37.870 --> 01:17:37.880 align:start position:0%
changes we've seen folks that we had
 
01:17:39.550 --> 01:17:39.560 align:start position:0%
reached out to a staffing change and the
 
01:17:41.910 --> 01:17:41.920 align:start position:0%
paperwork got lost in the mail and uh
 
01:17:43.830 --> 01:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
the original program allotted money
 
01:17:46.430 --> 01:17:46.440 align:start position:0%
based on a formula this would be an RFP
 
01:17:47.750 --> 01:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
process so those who would be most
 
01:17:50.070 --> 01:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
interested in participating would have
 
01:17:52.470 --> 01:17:52.480 align:start position:0%
um the ability to do so thank you very
 
01:17:54.149 --> 01:17:54.159 align:start position:0%
much all are there any questions from
 
01:17:54.159 --> 01:17:55.430 align:start position:0%
much all are there any questions from
representative

01:17:55.430 --> 01:17:55.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:17:58.790 --> 01:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
dry thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:18:02.629 --> 01:18:02.639 align:start position:0%
coming to testify um can we talk about
 
01:18:05.030 --> 01:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
border towns and how you determine
 
01:18:07.270 --> 01:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
what's a New Hampshire product and
 
01:18:09.470 --> 01:18:09.480 align:start position:0%
what's not you know the cooperatives in
 
01:18:12.229 --> 01:18:12.239 align:start position:0%
our area in the Upper Valley consider
 
01:18:14.709 --> 01:18:14.719 align:start position:0%
local as within 100 miles so um looking
 
01:18:16.590 --> 01:18:16.600 align:start position:0%
at the the reimbursement rate can you
 
01:18:20.030 --> 01:18:20.040 align:start position:0%
discuss that at all yeah so uh the the
 
01:18:22.390 --> 01:18:22.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire the state definition of of
 
01:18:24.910 --> 01:18:24.920 align:start position:0%
local is within the borders of New
 
01:18:28.110 --> 01:18:28.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire there's no there's no um
 
01:18:30.750 --> 01:18:30.760 align:start position:0%
outside the border the USDA definition
 
01:18:34.149 --> 01:18:34.159 align:start position:0%
is a radius from the point of production
 
01:18:37.310 --> 01:18:37.320 align:start position:0%
um so uh sorry from the point of sale so
 
01:18:39.189 --> 01:18:39.199 align:start position:0%
in the program that we're administrating
 
01:18:41.990 --> 01:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh through USDA we have to use the USDA
 
01:18:44.390 --> 01:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
definition which is 400 miles from the
 
01:18:46.550 --> 01:18:46.560 align:start position:0%
point of purchase and so those border
 
01:18:49.990 --> 01:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
towns count as local and Regional food
 
01:18:52.189 --> 01:18:52.199 align:start position:0%
um if if we were to use the New
 
01:18:54.390 --> 01:18:54.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire definition for specifically
 
01:18:56.470 --> 01:18:56.480 align:start position:0%
this bill it would only be products that
 
01:18:59.189 --> 01:18:59.199 align:start position:0%
were raised in New
 
01:18:59.199 --> 01:19:00.709 align:start position:0%
were raised in New
Hampshire

01:19:00.709 --> 01:19:00.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:19:03.270 --> 01:19:03.280 align:start position:0%
yes there's still kind of some gray
 
01:19:05.510 --> 01:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
areas is what's produced by New
 
01:19:07.910 --> 01:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire people in Vermont or processed
 
01:19:10.750 --> 01:19:10.760 align:start position:0%
in Vermont and sold in New Hampshire and
 
01:19:12.390 --> 01:19:12.400 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering if this addresses any
 
01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:15.149 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering if this addresses any
of

01:19:15.149 --> 01:19:15.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:17.790 --> 01:19:17.800 align:start position:0%
those I I'm not sure all all I'm aware
 
01:19:19.910 --> 01:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
of is that the definition of local in
 
01:19:22.229 --> 01:19:22.239 align:start position:0%
State Statute is only produced within
 
01:19:23.950 --> 01:19:23.960 align:start position:0%
the borders of New
 
01:19:26.229 --> 01:19:26.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm going to follow up with
 
01:19:28.350 --> 01:19:28.360 align:start position:0%
where represent R is because I'm also
 
01:19:31.189 --> 01:19:31.199 align:start position:0%
from the Upper Valley we have a probably
 
01:19:33.550 --> 01:19:33.560 align:start position:0%
one of the largest milk producers in our
 
01:19:35.870 --> 01:19:35.880 align:start position:0%
town hatchin Dairy but we also have
 
01:19:38.830 --> 01:19:38.840 align:start position:0%
school districts that are Interstate
 
01:19:41.910 --> 01:19:41.920 align:start position:0%
school districts which their districts
 
01:19:44.950 --> 01:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
extend over to Fairley Vermont they up
 
01:19:47.750 --> 01:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
on on the North side to Canan down to
 
01:19:50.270 --> 01:19:50.280 align:start position:0%
Brattleboro uh all over where we're
 
01:19:53.030 --> 01:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
we're sending kids back and forth so uh
 
01:19:56.669 --> 01:19:56.679 align:start position:0%
up our way local is local and it means
 
01:19:59.350 --> 01:19:59.360 align:start position:0%
the other side of the river too and so
 
01:20:01.030 --> 01:20:01.040 align:start position:0%
we raised this in the last time this
 
01:20:03.430 --> 01:20:03.440 align:start position:0%
bill our bills like this came forward
 
01:20:07.709 --> 01:20:07.719 align:start position:0%
and there's real concern that we respect
 
01:20:09.510 --> 01:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
um when we are putting things out
 
01:20:11.669 --> 01:20:11.679 align:start position:0%
through our select board municipal
 
01:20:14.990 --> 01:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
government uh we also see local as any
 
01:20:18.709 --> 01:20:18.719 align:start position:0%
town that AB buts our town on our side
 
01:20:21.149 --> 01:20:21.159 align:start position:0%
and so it can be over in Vermont as well
 
01:20:23.070 --> 01:20:23.080 align:start position:0%
so something that I think we got to be
 
01:20:25.790 --> 01:20:25.800 align:start position:0%
considering when we look at this and the
 
01:20:26.790 --> 01:20:26.800 align:start position:0%
same thing on the other side of the
 
01:20:28.430 --> 01:20:28.440 align:start position:0%
state too with
 
01:20:31.270 --> 01:20:31.280 align:start position:0%
Maine absolutely and
 
01:20:33.070 --> 01:20:33.080 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts I'm just reading just
 
01:20:35.149 --> 01:20:35.159 align:start position:0%
reading from the bill you know it's as
 
01:20:36.270 --> 01:20:36.280 align:start position:0%
it's written I know you didn't write
 
01:20:37.750 --> 01:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
this bill I know you're a technical
 
01:20:40.870 --> 01:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
sport so we're not hammering on you so
 
01:20:42.550 --> 01:20:42.560 align:start position:0%
um are there any other questions yes
 
01:20:44.430 --> 01:20:44.440 align:start position:0%
represent cordelli and then represent
 
01:20:47.229 --> 01:20:47.239 align:start position:0%
pum uh thank you very much for being
 
01:20:49.550 --> 01:20:49.560 align:start position:0%
here for your support uh technical
 
01:20:51.790 --> 01:20:51.800 align:start position:0%
support um I just wanted to ask about
 
01:20:55.870 --> 01:20:55.880 align:start position:0%
this USDA a program um did I understand
 
01:20:58.229 --> 01:20:58.239 align:start position:0%
correctly that there are six schools
 
01:21:01.590 --> 01:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
participating um at the cost of
 
01:21:05.189 --> 01:21:05.199 align:start position:0%
$188,000 and you expect that to grow to
 
01:21:08.709 --> 01:21:08.719 align:start position:0%
$250,000 correct and follow up yes um
 
01:21:10.750 --> 01:21:10.760 align:start position:0%
how long has that program uh been in
 
01:21:14.270 --> 01:21:14.280 align:start position:0%
existence here uh so that program
 
01:21:19.350 --> 01:21:19.360 align:start position:0%
started in in September
 
01:21:21.830 --> 01:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
of the agreement was made in September
 
01:21:24.669 --> 01:21:24.679 align:start position:0%
of 22 through a number of technical uh
 
01:21:28.870 --> 01:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
issues and and and some hurdles um its
 
01:21:31.669 --> 01:21:31.679 align:start position:0%
completion date is September of 2024 of
 
01:21:33.270 --> 01:21:33.280 align:start position:0%
this year so they we have the rest of
 
01:21:35.669 --> 01:21:35.679 align:start position:0%
this school year and a portion of uh
 
01:21:37.830 --> 01:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
September to expend the rest of the
 
01:21:39.870 --> 01:21:39.880 align:start position:0%
funding and those lessons that we
 
01:21:41.750 --> 01:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
learned that I mentioned I think would
 
01:21:44.270 --> 01:21:44.280 align:start position:0%
be uh mitigated now that we've gone
 
01:21:48.629 --> 01:21:48.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:52.310 --> 01:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
program um could we get an indication of
 
01:21:56.750 --> 01:21:56.760 align:start position:0%
what uh schools are currently
 
01:21:59.030 --> 01:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
participating I I could get you a list
 
01:22:01.870 --> 01:22:01.880 align:start position:0%
yeah great thank
 
01:22:05.310 --> 01:22:05.320 align:start position:0%
you further questions represent perel
 
01:22:06.510 --> 01:22:06.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:22:09.070 --> 01:22:09.080 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I spoke with a
 
01:22:11.990 --> 01:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
local farmer um in preparation for this
 
01:22:14.030 --> 01:22:14.040 align:start position:0%
bill and he told me that when they were
 
01:22:16.110 --> 01:22:16.120 align:start position:0%
trying to set up double up food bucks
 
01:22:19.430 --> 01:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
and the um a Granite State Market match
 
01:22:22.910 --> 01:22:22.920 align:start position:0%
the part of a snap program that the
 
01:22:24.950 --> 01:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
costs to the farmer were so exorbitant
 
01:22:26.550 --> 01:22:26.560 align:start position:0%
they would have had to hire another
 
01:22:28.629 --> 01:22:28.639 align:start position:0%
employee on their Farm just to keep up
 
01:22:30.430 --> 01:22:30.440 align:start position:0%
with the record keeping would there be
 
01:22:32.350 --> 01:22:32.360 align:start position:0%
recordkeeping associated with this on
 
01:22:34.870 --> 01:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
the farmer side I mean it's really
 
01:22:37.629 --> 01:22:37.639 align:start position:0%
expensive to farm and to make a money
 
01:22:40.590 --> 01:22:40.600 align:start position:0%
make earn an income as a farmer without
 
01:22:40.600 --> 01:22:41.629 align:start position:0%
make earn an income as a farmer without
government

01:22:41.629 --> 01:22:41.639 align:start position:0%
government
 
01:22:44.189 --> 01:22:44.199 align:start position:0%
subsidies thank you for the question uh
 
01:22:46.310 --> 01:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
there W from as I read this there would
 
01:22:49.470 --> 01:22:49.480 align:start position:0%
be no requirement on the farmer um both
 
01:22:51.470 --> 01:22:51.480 align:start position:0%
the local food for school program and
 
01:22:53.030 --> 01:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
the local food purchases assistance
 
01:22:55.870 --> 01:22:55.880 align:start position:0%
program another USDA uh funding source
 
01:22:58.390 --> 01:22:58.400 align:start position:0%
we have um that we're administering both
 
01:23:01.669 --> 01:23:01.679 align:start position:0%
are designed to have the least onus on
 
01:23:03.709 --> 01:23:03.719 align:start position:0%
the Farmer they would be their products
 
01:23:07.229 --> 01:23:07.239 align:start position:0%
would be purchased through normal uh the
 
01:23:08.990 --> 01:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
normal ways that anybody else would if
 
01:23:10.629 --> 01:23:10.639 align:start position:0%
they participate with a distributor then
 
01:23:12.990 --> 01:23:13.000 align:start position:0%
they'd be available there if the food
 
01:23:15.110 --> 01:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
service director or their staff can go
 
01:23:16.709 --> 01:23:16.719 align:start position:0%
directly to the farm then they can do
 
01:23:18.470 --> 01:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
that but uh they might not even know
 
01:23:19.750 --> 01:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
that they're participating in the
 
01:23:21.470 --> 01:23:21.480 align:start position:0%
program that's
 
01:23:24.510 --> 01:23:24.520 align:start position:0%
for further questions thank you very
 
01:23:34.709 --> 01:23:34.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:38.110 --> 01:23:38.120 align:start position:0%
persol good morning so I'm Stacy perso
 
01:23:39.709 --> 01:23:39.719 align:start position:0%
with the New Hampshire Farm to school
 
01:23:41.350 --> 01:23:41.360 align:start position:0%
program I work out of the University of
 
01:23:43.830 --> 01:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in the sustainability
 
01:23:47.629 --> 01:23:47.639 align:start position:0%
office so why does local food matter uh
 
01:23:49.750 --> 01:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
growing producing and buying local food
 
01:23:51.430 --> 01:23:51.440 align:start position:0%
represents opportunities to build
 
01:23:53.510 --> 01:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
resources wealth and resilience in local
 
01:23:55.910 --> 01:23:55.920 align:start position:0%
communities and to Balance power more
 
01:24:00.110 --> 01:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
evenly across the supply chain um eating
 
01:24:02.830 --> 01:24:02.840 align:start position:0%
Local Foods has become a priority of the
 
01:24:04.390 --> 01:24:04.400 align:start position:0%
United States Department of Agriculture
 
01:24:06.470 --> 01:24:06.480 align:start position:0%
to strengthen roal economies address
 
01:24:07.990 --> 01:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
environmental health food access and
 
01:24:10.229 --> 01:24:10.239 align:start position:0%
nutrition along with agricultural
 
01:24:12.990 --> 01:24:13.000 align:start position:0%
producers and markets Across America
 
01:24:15.350 --> 01:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
Transportation distances land use crop
 
01:24:17.510 --> 01:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
yields Animal Welfare we are budgeting
 
01:24:19.430 --> 01:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
for 8 to 10%
 
01:24:21.950 --> 01:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
increases a significant amount of this
 
01:24:23.790 --> 01:24:23.800 align:start position:0%
increase seems to be due to
 
01:24:26.149 --> 01:24:26.159 align:start position:0%
Transportation costs with increased fuel
 
01:24:28.510 --> 01:24:28.520 align:start position:0%
prices and availability of commercial
 
01:24:30.750 --> 01:24:30.760 align:start position:0%
truck drivers some of the many
 
01:24:32.750 --> 01:24:32.760 align:start position:0%
advantages of purchasing local products
 
01:24:34.590 --> 01:24:34.600 align:start position:0%
is to lower these Transportation costs
 
01:24:36.669 --> 01:24:36.679 align:start position:0%
lower emissions and improve the quality
 
01:24:39.470 --> 01:24:39.480 align:start position:0%
of the products the government County
 
01:24:41.709 --> 01:24:41.719 align:start position:0%
Office says that food food prices are
 
01:24:43.790 --> 01:24:43.800 align:start position:0%
going to continue to grow and are
 
01:24:46.270 --> 01:24:46.280 align:start position:0%
predicted to increase at around 8% this
 
01:24:48.709 --> 01:24:48.719 align:start position:0%
year by addressing supply chain
 
01:24:50.590 --> 01:24:50.600 align:start position:0%
disruptions the federal government May
 
01:24:53.669 --> 01:24:53.679 align:start position:0%
indirectly take action to address Rising
 
01:24:56.629 --> 01:24:56.639 align:start position:0%
food prices so one way and Josh
 
01:24:58.310 --> 01:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
mentioned this is with the local food
 
01:25:00.070 --> 01:25:00.080 align:start position:0%
for schools Cooperative agreement
 
01:25:03.430 --> 01:25:03.440 align:start position:0%
program each state was
 
01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:06.830 align:start position:0%
program each state was
awarded

01:25:06.830 --> 01:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:10.070 --> 01:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
wow I only got through a paragraph can
 
01:25:13.510 --> 01:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
you just uh you know give a summary of
 
01:25:14.750 --> 01:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
what you've got there without having to
 
01:25:17.709 --> 01:25:17.719 align:start position:0%
read it sure uh so we also have the
 
01:25:21.629 --> 01:25:21.639 align:start position:0%
granite state farmed plate RSA 425 2A
 
01:25:24.430 --> 01:25:24.440 align:start position:0%
which which encourages state agencies
 
01:25:28.709 --> 01:25:28.719 align:start position:0%
and the government to support um local
 
01:25:31.709 --> 01:25:31.719 align:start position:0%
producers um do schools already buy
 
01:25:34.030 --> 01:25:34.040 align:start position:0%
Local Foods I know we have some schools
 
01:25:36.430 --> 01:25:36.440 align:start position:0%
that have been buying local foods for a
 
01:25:37.910 --> 01:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
long time other schools don't
 
01:25:40.470 --> 01:25:40.480 align:start position:0%
participate at all so this incentive
 
01:25:42.550 --> 01:25:42.560 align:start position:0%
program is meant to encourage other
 
01:25:45.470 --> 01:25:45.480 align:start position:0%
schools who may not be participating to
 
01:25:50.510 --> 01:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
to start doing so um schools are buying
 
01:25:52.669 --> 01:25:52.679 align:start position:0%
you know storage crops apples carrots
 
01:25:54.990 --> 01:25:55.000 align:start position:0%
potatoes winter squashes proteins ground
 
01:25:58.669 --> 01:25:58.679 align:start position:0%
beef eggs fish um value added Dairy like
 
01:26:01.390 --> 01:26:01.400 align:start position:0%
yogurt uh lenis and spinach with our
 
01:26:03.470 --> 01:26:03.480 align:start position:0%
Hydroponics and Greenhouse production is
 
01:26:05.790 --> 01:26:05.800 align:start position:0%
available is written in your it is yeah
 
01:26:07.990 --> 01:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
can you provide the clerk a copy of what
 
01:26:11.709 --> 01:26:11.719 align:start position:0%
you have here yes I have copy all so
 
01:26:13.830 --> 01:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
there was another question um what is
 
01:26:16.709 --> 01:26:16.719 align:start position:0%
the impact of these programs across let
 
01:26:19.109 --> 01:26:19.119 align:start position:0%
somebody else ask the question okay well
 
01:26:20.790 --> 01:26:20.800 align:start position:0%
somebody asked it before goes the other
 
01:26:22.910 --> 01:26:22.920 align:start position:0%
way here okay okay representative
 
01:26:24.990 --> 01:26:25.000 align:start position:0%
peternell thank you Mr chair thank you
 
01:26:26.470 --> 01:26:26.480 align:start position:0%
for being here and taking my question
 
01:26:28.510 --> 01:26:28.520 align:start position:0%
can you tell me let's see if I'm wording
 
01:26:32.030 --> 01:26:32.040 align:start position:0%
this correctly what is the ability of
 
01:26:34.070 --> 01:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
the farms in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:26:36.550 --> 01:26:36.560 align:start position:0%
to feed our current state population
 
01:26:39.629 --> 01:26:39.639 align:start position:0%
like what percentage of the population
 
01:26:43.310 --> 01:26:43.320 align:start position:0%
could be fed imagine New Hampshire is an
 
01:26:45.590 --> 01:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
island what percentage of the farms in
 
01:26:46.950 --> 01:26:46.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire could feed our total
 
01:26:49.229 --> 01:26:49.239 align:start position:0%
population did I say that right what
 
01:26:50.830 --> 01:26:50.840 align:start position:0%
percentage of the population could be
 
01:26:54.270 --> 01:26:54.280 align:start position:0%
fed by the farmers in our well so that
 
01:26:56.629 --> 01:26:56.639 align:start position:0%
that when that statistic is out there
 
01:26:59.350 --> 01:26:59.360 align:start position:0%
it's not quite worded that way it's it's
 
01:27:04.310 --> 01:27:04.320 align:start position:0%
it says that um our state buys 6% of our
 
01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:05.910 align:start position:0%
it says that um our state buys 6% of our
food

01:27:05.910 --> 01:27:05.920 align:start position:0%
food
 
01:27:09.229 --> 01:27:09.239 align:start position:0%
locally and and um the rest of our food
 
01:27:11.270 --> 01:27:11.280 align:start position:0%
we get from other
 
01:27:14.830 --> 01:27:14.840 align:start position:0%
places further questions from the
 
01:27:19.470 --> 01:27:19.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:22.350 --> 01:27:22.360 align:start position:0%
me yeah just can can you thank you can
 
01:27:24.590 --> 01:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
you explain that statistic a little more
 
01:27:29.590 --> 01:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
6% of the food that we consume in our
 
01:27:32.430 --> 01:27:32.440 align:start position:0%
state food you consume might come from
 
01:27:33.830 --> 01:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:38.310 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
producers

01:27:38.310 --> 01:27:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:41.590 --> 01:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
so thank you repr
 
01:27:43.629 --> 01:27:43.639 align:start position:0%
beler thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:27:46.870 --> 01:27:46.880 align:start position:0%
for your testimony um I believe I heard
 
01:27:49.910 --> 01:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
that the USDA is trying to
 
01:27:54.709 --> 01:27:54.719 align:start position:0%
prioritize local um funding of food um
 
01:27:57.510 --> 01:27:57.520 align:start position:0%
and then from what we know it's not
 
01:28:00.550 --> 01:28:00.560 align:start position:0%
coming back again so
 
01:28:03.270 --> 01:28:03.280 align:start position:0%
um so I don't know that the USDA is
 
01:28:04.830 --> 01:28:04.840 align:start position:0%
going to say that schools have to buy
 
01:28:07.430 --> 01:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
local they're trying to you know
 
01:28:11.350 --> 01:28:11.360 align:start position:0%
encourage it but they still have um
 
01:28:13.149 --> 01:28:13.159 align:start position:0%
guidelines in place about how a school
 
01:28:16.550 --> 01:28:16.560 align:start position:0%
has to go about purchasing food um they
 
01:28:20.229 --> 01:28:20.239 align:start position:0%
have to put food out for bid um if they
 
01:28:22.270 --> 01:28:22.280 align:start position:0%
only have you know a couple of dollars
 
01:28:25.590 --> 01:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
put a meal on a plate it's still um as
 
01:28:27.310 --> 01:28:27.320 align:start position:0%
far as I know they're not going to be
 
01:28:30.390 --> 01:28:30.400 align:start position:0%
giving more money to increase the amount
 
01:28:31.950 --> 01:28:31.960 align:start position:0%
of money they get to produce a school
 
01:28:35.270 --> 01:28:35.280 align:start position:0%
meal so there's a lot of obstacles that
 
01:28:38.990 --> 01:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
can make it difficult for a school to BU
 
01:28:42.310 --> 01:28:42.320 align:start position:0%
local so we're trying to make it
 
01:28:45.709 --> 01:28:45.719 align:start position:0%
easier thank you represent dry thank you
 
01:28:48.510 --> 01:28:48.520 align:start position:0%
and thank you for coming uh with all
 
01:28:50.270 --> 01:28:50.280 align:start position:0%
these programs we've heard about today
 
01:28:51.990 --> 01:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
and I'm looking at now vital communities
 
01:28:53.750 --> 01:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
over in my area that's already doing
 
01:28:55.390 --> 01:28:55.400 align:start position:0%
Farm to school projects all the time
 
01:28:57.310 --> 01:28:57.320 align:start position:0%
that are funded do we have enough
 
01:28:59.070 --> 01:28:59.080 align:start position:0%
collectively already that we've done a
 
01:29:02.030 --> 01:29:02.040 align:start position:0%
2-year pilot program in New
 
01:29:06.030 --> 01:29:06.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um we don't have like data
 
01:29:08.629 --> 01:29:08.639 align:start position:0%
around that collected around that I know
 
01:29:10.750 --> 01:29:10.760 align:start position:0%
and when I say when a school says they
 
01:29:12.830 --> 01:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
participate in farm to school it doesn't
 
01:29:14.270 --> 01:29:14.280 align:start position:0%
always mean they're buying local food
 
01:29:15.709 --> 01:29:15.719 align:start position:0%
because there are other components of
 
01:29:17.149 --> 01:29:17.159 align:start position:0%
farm the school like school garden
 
01:29:19.629 --> 01:29:19.639 align:start position:0%
programs and classroom education so they
 
01:29:22.270 --> 01:29:22.280 align:start position:0%
could be doing that or maybe if they buy
 
01:29:25.709 --> 01:29:25.719 align:start position:0%
apples once from a Orchard they they say
 
01:29:28.030 --> 01:29:28.040 align:start position:0%
they're doing Farm to school so I don't
 
01:29:30.629 --> 01:29:30.639 align:start position:0%
really have good data to support your
 
01:29:33.950 --> 01:29:33.960 align:start position:0%
question can I have a follow yes thank
 
01:29:36.070 --> 01:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
you um what are some of the impacts of
 
01:29:38.109 --> 01:29:38.119 align:start position:0%
the program you were just about to talk
 
01:29:42.870 --> 01:29:42.880 align:start position:0%
about oh so um so as representative
 
01:29:46.149 --> 01:29:46.159 align:start position:0%
Simpson me me uh mentioned uh there's a
 
01:29:48.910 --> 01:29:48.920 align:start position:0%
grad student at tus who did her master's
 
01:29:51.990 --> 01:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
uh program on Research around these
 
01:29:54.270 --> 01:29:54.280 align:start position:0%
reimbursement or incentive programs that
 
01:29:58.109 --> 01:29:58.119 align:start position:0%
are in about 15 states across the
 
01:30:02.669 --> 01:30:02.679 align:start position:0%
country so the impact um these programs
 
01:30:04.669 --> 01:30:04.679 align:start position:0%
can support small new and
 
01:30:07.310 --> 01:30:07.320 align:start position:0%
underrepresented producers they support
 
01:30:09.470 --> 01:30:09.480 align:start position:0%
more direct Farm purchases which gives
 
01:30:11.790 --> 01:30:11.800 align:start position:0%
more money to the Farmer they support
 
01:30:14.310 --> 01:30:14.320 align:start position:0%
socially geographically and economically
 
01:30:17.189 --> 01:30:17.199 align:start position:0%
diverse student populations there's an
 
01:30:19.430 --> 01:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
increased demand for Local Foods New
 
01:30:21.350 --> 01:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
locally produced food products have been
 
01:30:24.270 --> 01:30:24.280 align:start position:0%
developed just for schools they improve
 
01:30:26.910 --> 01:30:26.920 align:start position:0%
local food supply chains they increase
 
01:30:28.830 --> 01:30:28.840 align:start position:0%
opportunities for nutrition and
 
01:30:31.390 --> 01:30:31.400 align:start position:0%
agriculture education they increase
 
01:30:33.950 --> 01:30:33.960 align:start position:0%
participation in school meals and that
 
01:30:37.669 --> 01:30:37.679 align:start position:0%
the economic impact is greater than the
 
01:30:40.390 --> 01:30:40.400 align:start position:0%
investment represent beler thank you Mr
 
01:30:42.310 --> 01:30:42.320 align:start position:0%
chair sorry but this just jumped out at
 
01:30:44.950 --> 01:30:44.960 align:start position:0%
me as another question um so we we just
 
01:30:48.470 --> 01:30:48.480 align:start position:0%
heard that the the USDA uh guidelines
 
01:30:49.550 --> 01:30:49.560 align:start position:0%
that are imposed by the federal
 
01:30:51.350 --> 01:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
government for the free lunch program
 
01:30:54.669 --> 01:30:54.679 align:start position:0%
make it difficult to really expend those
 
01:31:00.950 --> 01:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
funds locally um however uh article six
 
01:31:02.550 --> 01:31:02.560 align:start position:0%
in this bill says that all food
 
01:31:03.910 --> 01:31:03.920 align:start position:0%
purchased through this program shall
 
01:31:05.310 --> 01:31:05.320 align:start position:0%
comply with the national school lunch
 
01:31:07.550 --> 01:31:07.560 align:start position:0%
program guidelines so would this bill
 
01:31:09.430 --> 01:31:09.440 align:start position:0%
not be hampered in that exact same way
 
01:31:11.590 --> 01:31:11.600 align:start position:0%
as current programs it's it's those are
 
01:31:13.229 --> 01:31:13.239 align:start position:0%
the nutrition guidelines so it has to
 
01:31:15.229 --> 01:31:15.239 align:start position:0%
meet nutrition
 
01:31:17.430 --> 01:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
guidelines that that's also here but it
 
01:31:19.510 --> 01:31:19.520 align:start position:0%
also says all national school lunch
 
01:31:21.590 --> 01:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
program guidelines must be adhered to
 
01:31:23.870 --> 01:31:23.880 align:start position:0%
right right as far as how they have to
 
01:31:26.189 --> 01:31:26.199 align:start position:0%
go about purchasing food
 
01:31:28.310 --> 01:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
yes further questions from the
 
01:31:30.750 --> 01:31:30.760 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner thank you and
 
01:31:32.109 --> 01:31:32.119 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I
 
01:31:35.030 --> 01:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
wonder if did the study point out that
 
01:31:37.790 --> 01:31:37.800 align:start position:0%
it's probably more important for as
 
01:31:40.709 --> 01:31:40.719 align:start position:0%
representative tersi mentioned living in
 
01:31:43.510 --> 01:31:43.520 align:start position:0%
nashwa that the urban areas be exposed
 
01:31:45.350 --> 01:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
to this whereas I think in the Upper
 
01:31:49.790 --> 01:31:49.800 align:start position:0%
Valley and um in suvin County which
 
01:31:52.390 --> 01:31:52.400 align:start position:0%
representative dry and I represent uh
 
01:31:54.709 --> 01:31:54.719 align:start position:0%
I'm sure most of the kids in schools
 
01:31:58.149 --> 01:31:58.159 align:start position:0%
there um have gone apple picking or have
 
01:32:00.910 --> 01:32:00.920 align:start position:0%
been exposed to
 
01:32:04.629 --> 01:32:04.639 align:start position:0%
farming yes so um I know there's been
 
01:32:06.510 --> 01:32:06.520 align:start position:0%
some Farm to school efforts in the nsha
 
01:32:08.030 --> 01:32:08.040 align:start position:0%
school district and there's a number of
 
01:32:09.750 --> 01:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
garden programs and a number of the
 
01:32:13.470 --> 01:32:13.480 align:start position:0%
schools um the same in Manchester uh the
 
01:32:16.070 --> 01:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
food service director there um has made
 
01:32:21.830 --> 01:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
some efforts to purchase Local Foods um
 
01:32:24.510 --> 01:32:24.520 align:start position:0%
and I think and if I don't Josh can
 
01:32:26.350 --> 01:32:26.360 align:start position:0%
correct me but I think Manchester is
 
01:32:28.070 --> 01:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
going to be on board for the Cooperative
 
01:32:30.709 --> 01:32:30.719 align:start position:0%
agreement funds um so they are going to
 
01:32:32.270 --> 01:32:32.280 align:start position:0%
have I don't know
 
01:32:34.910 --> 01:32:34.920 align:start position:0%
$100,000 to spend on local and regional
 
01:32:37.709 --> 01:32:37.719 align:start position:0%
foods um
 
01:32:39.950 --> 01:32:39.960 align:start position:0%
soon further questions from the
 
01:32:42.350 --> 01:32:42.360 align:start position:0%
committee thank you very
 
01:32:49.750 --> 01:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:53.709 --> 01:32:53.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:56.030 --> 01:32:56.040 align:start position:0%
of which you were the chairman of that's
 
01:32:58.870 --> 01:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
correct good morning thank you to uh
 
01:33:00.830 --> 01:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
chairman lad and to the house education
 
01:33:03.350 --> 01:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
committee I um what I hope is a
 
01:33:04.910 --> 01:33:04.920 align:start position:0%
beautiful narrative story about the
 
01:33:06.709 --> 01:33:06.719 align:start position:0%
importance of local food for our
 
01:33:09.950 --> 01:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
communities and I'll share that um uh as
 
01:33:12.109 --> 01:33:12.119 align:start position:0%
I can I have a few copies here I think
 
01:33:13.149 --> 01:33:13.159 align:start position:0%
what I'd like to bring to this
 
01:33:14.470 --> 01:33:14.480 align:start position:0%
conversation that I haven't heard
 
01:33:17.350 --> 01:33:17.360 align:start position:0%
represented yet today is the concept of
 
01:33:19.470 --> 01:33:19.480 align:start position:0%
agricultural and food literacy which is
 
01:33:23.470 --> 01:33:23.480 align:start position:0%
so important for all of us um so beyond
 
01:33:26.669 --> 01:33:26.679 align:start position:0%
bringing local food into our schools we
 
01:33:28.669 --> 01:33:28.679 align:start position:0%
all know that it's important how we feed
 
01:33:30.310 --> 01:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
children how we talk about the food that
 
01:33:33.229 --> 01:33:33.239 align:start position:0%
we feed them and um how they see us
 
01:33:36.070 --> 01:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
going about sourcing and buying our food
 
01:33:38.629 --> 01:33:38.639 align:start position:0%
uh and it is no different to need to do
 
01:33:40.350 --> 01:33:40.360 align:start position:0%
those kinds of things and talk about why
 
01:33:42.350 --> 01:33:42.360 align:start position:0%
you're eating what you're eating and how
 
01:33:44.390 --> 01:33:44.400 align:start position:0%
you are bringing food to the table at
 
01:33:47.229 --> 01:33:47.239 align:start position:0%
home than it is in school and so by
 
01:33:49.149 --> 01:33:49.159 align:start position:0%
investing in our youngest New Hampshire
 
01:33:51.790 --> 01:33:51.800 align:start position:0%
citizens and saying we do want schools
 
01:33:53.390 --> 01:33:53.400 align:start position:0%
to bring in more local food and we want
 
01:33:55.629 --> 01:33:55.639 align:start position:0%
this to be a bigger conversation so that
 
01:33:57.750 --> 01:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
these young New Hampshire citizens can
 
01:33:59.669 --> 01:33:59.679 align:start position:0%
uh grow up understanding more if they
 
01:34:01.590 --> 01:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
live in an urban area where food comes
 
01:34:04.030 --> 01:34:04.040 align:start position:0%
from and how local food is an important
 
01:34:05.669 --> 01:34:05.679 align:start position:0%
part of their their lives in their
 
01:34:07.950 --> 01:34:07.960 align:start position:0%
community so we're shaping habits in
 
01:34:09.430 --> 01:34:09.440 align:start position:0%
purchasing we're shaping habits in
 
01:34:12.629 --> 01:34:12.639 align:start position:0%
eating and we all know I'm sure Brody
 
01:34:14.510 --> 01:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire hunger Solutions can
 
01:34:16.790 --> 01:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
um provide some statistics on a lot of
 
01:34:18.750 --> 01:34:18.760 align:start position:0%
kids are receiving the the majority of
 
01:34:21.270 --> 01:34:21.280 align:start position:0%
their calories at in a school setting so
 
01:34:24.229 --> 01:34:24.239 align:start position:0%
it's it's critical that they have every
 
01:34:28.189 --> 01:34:28.199 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be um meaningfully
 
01:34:31.510 --> 01:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
engaging with our local surroundings um
 
01:34:34.229 --> 01:34:34.239 align:start position:0%
with local and Regional food in the
 
01:34:36.990 --> 01:34:37.000 align:start position:0%
school setting um it's not really a
 
01:34:39.430 --> 01:34:39.440 align:start position:0%
luxury it's something that as we look
 
01:34:42.390 --> 01:34:42.400 align:start position:0%
towards our our climate future and our
 
01:34:42.400 --> 01:34:43.510 align:start position:0%
towards our our climate future and our
children's

01:34:43.510 --> 01:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
children's
 
01:34:46.830 --> 01:34:46.840 align:start position:0%
future it's critical that they shape
 
01:34:48.590 --> 01:34:48.600 align:start position:0%
these skills at these De Young
 
01:34:50.790 --> 01:34:50.800 align:start position:0%
developmental stages you know we all
 
01:34:52.629 --> 01:34:52.639 align:start position:0%
think about baby and how important it is
 
01:34:54.550 --> 01:34:54.560 align:start position:0%
for them to start feeding themselves and
 
01:34:56.709 --> 01:34:56.719 align:start position:0%
getting those fine motor skills but as
 
01:34:58.750 --> 01:34:58.760 align:start position:0%
they grow older with each age bracket
 
01:35:00.229 --> 01:35:00.239 align:start position:0%
come different critical food and
 
01:35:02.350 --> 01:35:02.360 align:start position:0%
agricultural literacy skills and
 
01:35:04.149 --> 01:35:04.159 align:start position:0%
bringing these Foods into the schools
 
01:35:05.830 --> 01:35:05.840 align:start position:0%
and having them talked about and
 
01:35:08.109 --> 01:35:08.119 align:start position:0%
celebrated in schools will help children
 
01:35:12.189 --> 01:35:12.199 align:start position:0%
develop those um those Frameworks thank
 
01:35:13.669 --> 01:35:13.679 align:start position:0%
you very much I'm happy to take any
 
01:35:14.950 --> 01:35:14.960 align:start position:0%

01:35:14.960 --> 01:35:15.629 align:start position:0%
questions are there any questions from
the

01:35:15.629 --> 01:35:15.639 align:start position:0%
the

good morning my name is Phil Brown and
 
01:35:46.910 --> 01:35:46.920 align:start position:0%
I'm a retired conet High School science
 
01:35:49.070 --> 01:35:49.080 align:start position:0%
teacher and we're sitting under the
 
01:35:51.750 --> 01:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
portrait of my colleague who in 11 days
 
01:35:54.310 --> 01:35:54.320 align:start position:0%
from now would have been dead now for 38
 
01:35:58.390 --> 01:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
years okay Christa mlli the last two
 
01:36:01.070 --> 01:36:01.080 align:start position:0%
lines on her Epitaph on her headstone
 
01:36:04.270 --> 01:36:04.280 align:start position:0%
written by her husband she loved her
 
01:36:08.310 --> 01:36:08.320 align:start position:0%
spaceship earth she taught her children
 
01:36:09.669 --> 01:36:09.679 align:start position:0%
to do the
 
01:36:12.790 --> 01:36:12.800 align:start position:0%
same to me the most important aspect of
 
01:36:15.430 --> 01:36:15.440 align:start position:0%
this bill as a retired teacher is the
 
01:36:19.310 --> 01:36:19.320 align:start position:0%
potential that it presents to as this
 
01:36:21.950 --> 01:36:21.960 align:start position:0%
young woman from Hanover Co-op just said
 
01:36:25.910 --> 01:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
get our children involved in farming and
 
01:36:28.950 --> 01:36:28.960 align:start position:0%
agriculture the most important skill set
 
01:36:31.310 --> 01:36:31.320 align:start position:0%
that we can pass on to our children
 
01:36:33.750 --> 01:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
right now in an era of food
 
01:36:38.709 --> 01:36:38.719 align:start position:0%
insecurity is how to grow monitor
 
01:36:43.189 --> 01:36:43.199 align:start position:0%
Harvest process store and eat healthy
 
01:36:45.910 --> 01:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
food what this bill will do will be
 
01:36:49.189 --> 01:36:49.199 align:start position:0%
allow children through their teachers to
 
01:36:51.270 --> 01:36:51.280 align:start position:0%
interact with community members Farm
 
01:36:55.550 --> 01:36:55.560 align:start position:0%
farmers who are doing just that and that
 
01:36:58.430 --> 01:36:58.440 align:start position:0%
to me is the critical piece of this
 
01:37:00.830 --> 01:37:00.840 align:start position:0%
legislation is that
 
01:37:03.270 --> 01:37:03.280 align:start position:0%
interaction and that's all I need to say
 
01:37:05.149 --> 01:37:05.159 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
 
01:37:07.070 --> 01:37:07.080 align:start position:0%

Stacy Perlo to do this since 2018 and
 
01:37:52.790 --> 01:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
I'd like to share some of the real
 
01:37:55.189 --> 01:37:55.199 align:start position:0%
reasons why this bill this particular
 
01:37:57.910 --> 01:37:57.920 align:start position:0%
bill would this and this network could
 
01:38:00.109 --> 01:38:00.119 align:start position:0%
work hand inand based on what we've been
 
01:38:02.510 --> 01:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
doing with schools in the past couple of
 
01:38:05.189 --> 01:38:05.199 align:start position:0%

work with Berlin Headstart which
 
01:38:29.189 --> 01:38:29.199 align:start position:0%
includes some of our most vulnerable
 
01:38:32.070 --> 01:38:32.080 align:start position:0%
students or population in our
 
01:38:35.350 --> 01:38:35.360 align:start position:0%
County so I serve as a co-lead and I
 
01:38:37.430 --> 01:38:37.440 align:start position:0%
also have expertise around food access
 
01:38:39.510 --> 01:38:39.520 align:start position:0%
and food and security for Cooperative
 
01:38:41.750 --> 01:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
Extension but what's really important
 
01:38:44.589 --> 01:38:44.599 align:start position:0%
here is that we had a couple of Grants
 
01:38:47.149 --> 01:38:47.159 align:start position:0%
to support bringing in our schools and
 
01:38:48.790 --> 01:38:48.800 align:start position:0%
helping to them to
 
01:38:52.189 --> 01:38:52.199 align:start position:0%
build action plans around School
 
01:38:55.070 --> 01:38:55.080 align:start position:0%
procurement they're ready to do this
 
01:38:58.030 --> 01:38:58.040 align:start position:0%
type of work we also have a and
 
01:39:00.550 --> 01:39:00.560 align:start position:0%
nutrition education action plans and
 
01:39:02.910 --> 01:39:02.920 align:start position:0%
they're very excited and very engaged in
 
01:39:04.750 --> 01:39:04.760 align:start position:0%
this work already in these schools that
 
01:39:05.790 --> 01:39:05.800 align:start position:0%
I've just
 
01:39:09.310 --> 01:39:09.320 align:start position:0%
mentioned a couple of examples um and
 
01:39:12.390 --> 01:39:12.400 align:start position:0%
how we're actually creating data as that
 
01:39:14.189 --> 01:39:14.199 align:start position:0%
built built into our recent
 
01:39:15.950 --> 01:39:15.960 align:start position:0%
implementation grant that we just
 
01:39:19.030 --> 01:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
submitted to USDA includes contacting of
 
01:39:22.669 --> 01:39:22.679 align:start position:0%
44 Farms this past year in our local
 
01:39:24.910 --> 01:39:24.920 align:start position:0%
area to discuss establishing a farm to
 
01:39:27.470 --> 01:39:27.480 align:start position:0%
cafeteria relationship and that includes
 
01:39:29.430 --> 01:39:29.440 align:start position:0%
14 of them actually getting back to us
 
01:39:31.350 --> 01:39:31.360 align:start position:0%
saying yes we want to work with you we
 
01:39:33.270 --> 01:39:33.280 align:start position:0%
want to work with our school Food
 
01:39:36.629 --> 01:39:36.639 align:start position:0%
Services this also involved discussions
 
01:39:38.950 --> 01:39:38.960 align:start position:0%
with okay all right I did I did want to
 
01:39:41.430 --> 01:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
mention one thing if I could um what
 
01:39:43.390 --> 01:39:43.400 align:start position:0%
happens when it doesn't work because we
 
01:39:45.750 --> 01:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
do have schools that are the first this
 
01:39:48.189 --> 01:39:48.199 align:start position:0%
this fall they brought in fresh corn
 
01:39:50.070 --> 01:39:50.080 align:start position:0%
from my from one of our mland farmers
 
01:39:52.109 --> 01:39:52.119 align:start position:0%
and they also have m maple syrup that
 
01:39:53.750 --> 01:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
they've been using since we've been
 
01:39:55.470 --> 01:39:55.480 align:start position:0%
working with them but when it doesn't
 
01:39:57.350 --> 01:39:57.360 align:start position:0%
work we have Berlin third grade
 
01:39:59.910 --> 01:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
classroom and this this teacher is an
 
01:40:02.229 --> 01:40:02.239 align:start position:0%
amazing rock star and what's happened
 
01:40:04.550 --> 01:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
with her is that she's doing our New
 
01:40:07.030 --> 01:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Harvest of the month education
 
01:40:09.189 --> 01:40:09.199 align:start position:0%
but she's not able to actually bring in
 
01:40:11.830 --> 01:40:11.840 align:start position:0%
the local foods with the taste testing
 
01:40:13.990 --> 01:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
and that comes through the opportunity
 
01:40:16.790 --> 01:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
to work with the school Food Service I
 
01:40:20.109 --> 01:40:20.119 align:start position:0%
will note Berlin Elementary School is
 
01:40:22.390 --> 01:40:22.400 align:start position:0%
one of our high EST free and reduced
 
01:40:25.030 --> 01:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
lunch figures in the state as well as in
 
01:40:29.270 --> 01:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
our County at 62.3 2% this is where
 
01:40:31.390 --> 01:40:31.400 align:start position:0%
these things can work together thank you
 
01:40:35.430 --> 01:40:35.440 align:start position:0%
Nikki Heidi Heidi thank you and I called
 
01:40:38.070 --> 01:40:38.080 align:start position:0%
you Baker in his spker it's okay you
 
01:40:40.589 --> 01:40:40.599 align:start position:0%
know it's but thank you so much I
 
01:40:42.950 --> 01:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
appreciate my time you're welcome are
 
01:40:45.470 --> 01:40:45.480 align:start position:0%
there any qu questions for the co-op or
 
01:40:49.550 --> 01:40:49.560 align:start position:0%
the extension service uh yes represent
 
01:40:52.350 --> 01:40:52.360 align:start position:0%
leus great right here oh right there oh
 
01:40:54.270 --> 01:40:54.280 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I was looking over here sorry
 
01:40:57.990 --> 01:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
I certainly believe that um local fresh
 
01:41:02.629 --> 01:41:02.639 align:start position:0%
food is better for you than um traveled
 
01:41:05.270 --> 01:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
across the country and potentially from
 
01:41:08.109 --> 01:41:08.119 align:start position:0%
Mexico or even farther you know because
 
01:41:11.310 --> 01:41:11.320 align:start position:0%
food deteriorates over time but I
 
01:41:15.910 --> 01:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
am trying to work out the um I guess
 
01:41:18.189 --> 01:41:18.199 align:start position:0%
actual costs of the
 
01:41:21.430 --> 01:41:21.440 align:start position:0%
program to subtract off
 
01:41:24.629 --> 01:41:24.639 align:start position:0%
what does it cost the St what does it
 
01:41:28.950 --> 01:41:28.960 align:start position:0%
cost on average do you know to buy say
 
01:41:31.470 --> 01:41:31.480 align:start position:0%
carrots the way other schools are buying
 
01:41:34.910 --> 01:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
carrots from wherever versus what the
 
01:41:37.990 --> 01:41:38.000 align:start position:0%
carrots would cost this way just so we
 
01:41:40.350 --> 01:41:40.360 align:start position:0%
can see what that difference is so
 
01:41:42.070 --> 01:41:42.080 align:start position:0%
that's a great question it's something
 
01:41:44.189 --> 01:41:44.199 align:start position:0%
that I don't have at my fingertips but
 
01:41:46.109 --> 01:41:46.119 align:start position:0%
we would certainly want to research that
 
01:41:48.669 --> 01:41:48.679 align:start position:0%
and get back to you I can say just based
 
01:41:50.589 --> 01:41:50.599 align:start position:0%
on the work that I do in Coos County and
 
01:41:52.430 --> 01:41:52.440 align:start position:0%
some of of the events we've had Local
 
01:41:54.750 --> 01:41:54.760 align:start position:0%
Foods is definitely more expensive we
 
01:41:56.950 --> 01:41:56.960 align:start position:0%
have to understand that a lot of hard
 
01:41:59.790 --> 01:41:59.800 align:start position:0%
work energy goes in with those producers
 
01:42:02.790 --> 01:42:02.800 align:start position:0%
I I I understand I'm just trying to get
 
01:42:04.950 --> 01:42:04.960 align:start position:0%
so I can't give you that percentage but
 
01:42:06.589 --> 01:42:06.599 align:start position:0%
I'm sure that's something that we can um
 
01:42:08.629 --> 01:42:08.639 align:start position:0%
figure out and get back to the committee
 
01:42:10.149 --> 01:42:10.159 align:start position:0%
thank you good question thank you
 
01:42:12.550 --> 01:42:12.560 align:start position:0%
further questions representative Pell
 
01:42:13.709 --> 01:42:13.719 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:42:16.910 --> 01:42:16.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question um my children were
 
01:42:18.589 --> 01:42:18.599 align:start position:0%
raised on a farm I have a daughter who's
 
01:42:21.669 --> 01:42:21.679 align:start position:0%
a chef and
 
01:42:23.750 --> 01:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
she has participated in some of these
 
01:42:26.990 --> 01:42:27.000 align:start position:0%
farm totable programs learning how to
 
01:42:29.550 --> 01:42:29.560 align:start position:0%
cook from Farm to Table obviously but
 
01:42:31.229 --> 01:42:31.239 align:start position:0%
the disconnect even at the
 
01:42:33.390 --> 01:42:33.400 align:start position:0%
professionally trained Chef level of
 
01:42:36.310 --> 01:42:36.320 align:start position:0%
where your food comes from and what it
 
01:42:38.390 --> 01:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
takes to raise that food and to get it
 
01:42:40.709 --> 01:42:40.719 align:start position:0%
to the table there's still a surprising
 
01:42:42.510 --> 01:42:42.520 align:start position:0%
disconnect at
 
01:42:46.030 --> 01:42:46.040 align:start position:0%
that level of Education how are these
 
01:42:48.149 --> 01:42:48.159 align:start position:0%
children actually learning where their
 
01:42:50.149 --> 01:42:50.159 align:start position:0%
food comes from Because unless you've
 
01:42:51.350 --> 01:42:51.360 align:start position:0%
actually been
 
01:42:54.830 --> 01:42:54.840 align:start position:0%
working in the dirt right on a daytoday
 
01:42:57.310 --> 01:42:57.320 align:start position:0%
basis it still just shows up on your
 
01:43:00.990 --> 01:43:01.000 align:start position:0%
table and there's this it just magically
 
01:43:04.030 --> 01:43:04.040 align:start position:0%
appears right you you come and sit down
 
01:43:06.310 --> 01:43:06.320 align:start position:0%
for lunch and there's your food what is
 
01:43:09.709 --> 01:43:09.719 align:start position:0%
this process of bringing the farm to
 
01:43:11.910 --> 01:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
these actual students so that they
 
01:43:14.830 --> 01:43:14.840 align:start position:0%
really experience it sure so that's an
 
01:43:16.510 --> 01:43:16.520 align:start position:0%
another great question and I appreciate
 
01:43:18.950 --> 01:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
that representative so there's lots of
 
01:43:20.750 --> 01:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
ways that we do that with our farm to
 
01:43:22.950 --> 01:43:22.960 align:start position:0%
School programming in the in the six
 
01:43:24.629 --> 01:43:24.639 align:start position:0%
schools as well as Berlin Head Start
 
01:43:26.470 --> 01:43:26.480 align:start position:0%
that I mentioned we have been able to
 
01:43:28.510 --> 01:43:28.520 align:start position:0%
put hydroponic units into our schools
 
01:43:30.189 --> 01:43:30.199 align:start position:0%
with some of the grant money that we've
 
01:43:33.470 --> 01:43:33.480 align:start position:0%
received we're doing try days and we
 
01:43:35.870 --> 01:43:35.880 align:start position:0%
also are doing um opportunities for
 
01:43:38.189 --> 01:43:38.199 align:start position:0%
field trips and getting kids out onto
 
01:43:40.589 --> 01:43:40.599 align:start position:0%
the farm so they can see what's going on
 
01:43:42.589 --> 01:43:42.599 align:start position:0%
the other thing about UNH Cooperative
 
01:43:45.910 --> 01:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
Extension is that we do this uh
 
01:43:47.950 --> 01:43:47.960 align:start position:0%
collaboration again with Stacy and her
 
01:43:49.589 --> 01:43:49.599 align:start position:0%
programming New Hampshire Harvest of the
 
01:43:51.629 --> 01:43:51.639 align:start position:0%
month as well as pick a better snack so
 
01:43:53.870 --> 01:43:53.880 align:start position:0%
we talk about these things and so we're
 
01:43:55.990 --> 01:43:56.000 align:start position:0%
in the classrooms as well as training
 
01:43:58.629 --> 01:43:58.639 align:start position:0%
our teachers to do the same thing so I
 
01:44:01.229 --> 01:44:01.239 align:start position:0%
can speak about what's happening in
 
01:44:03.390 --> 01:44:03.400 align:start position:0%
Andrew scogan Valley in particular
 
01:44:06.390 --> 01:44:06.400 align:start position:0%
because these teachers as we've created
 
01:44:08.870 --> 01:44:08.880 align:start position:0%
a a network of staff and teacher
 
01:44:11.709 --> 01:44:11.719 align:start position:0%
Champions who are really excited about
 
01:44:14.430 --> 01:44:14.440 align:start position:0%
this work and they're dedicated to it
 
01:44:16.830 --> 01:44:16.840 align:start position:0%
and even without funding this year which
 
01:44:19.750 --> 01:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
we don't have these teachers and staff
 
01:44:22.229 --> 01:44:22.239 align:start position:0%
are doing this work and that's why we
 
01:44:25.550 --> 01:44:25.560 align:start position:0%
just submitted a a bigger USDA Grant but
 
01:44:28.350 --> 01:44:28.360 align:start position:0%
um it's it really is about us getting
 
01:44:30.350 --> 01:44:30.360 align:start position:0%
out there and training using some of the
 
01:44:32.589 --> 01:44:32.599 align:start position:0%
evidence-based curriculum and materials
 
01:44:34.030 --> 01:44:34.040 align:start position:0%
that we have and working with our
 
01:44:36.750 --> 01:44:36.760 align:start position:0%
teachers to share with them these ideas
 
01:44:38.310 --> 01:44:38.320 align:start position:0%
that you're talking about I too was
 
01:44:39.910 --> 01:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
raised on a farm and understand where
 
01:44:41.709 --> 01:44:41.719 align:start position:0%
our food comes from but you're right
 
01:44:43.750 --> 01:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
there is a disconnect and that's why
 
01:44:46.550 --> 01:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
we've built this network it's a
 
01:44:49.589 --> 01:44:49.599 align:start position:0%
system and it's baby steps that's what
 
01:44:51.350 --> 01:44:51.360 align:start position:0%
I've learned from the last last 15 years
 
01:44:52.669 --> 01:44:52.679 align:start position:0%
in the work I've done with health and
 
01:44:55.310 --> 01:44:55.320 align:start position:0%
well-being and with food security
 
01:44:58.070 --> 01:44:58.080 align:start position:0%
efforts it's that it's baby steps we're
 
01:45:00.070 --> 01:45:00.080 align:start position:0%
only going to be able to do so much at a
 
01:45:03.430 --> 01:45:03.440 align:start position:0%
time but we can do it thank you further
 
01:45:06.189 --> 01:45:06.199 align:start position:0%
questions represent Ry thank you and
 
01:45:10.910 --> 01:45:10.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming um I'm hearing all
 
01:45:12.750 --> 01:45:12.760 align:start position:0%
lots of pieces I know the Cooperative
 
01:45:14.310 --> 01:45:14.320 align:start position:0%
Extension has a real robust program
 
01:45:16.589 --> 01:45:16.599 align:start position:0%
throughout the state and um you were
 
01:45:19.229 --> 01:45:19.239 align:start position:0%
saying they were ready to procure up in
 
01:45:21.070 --> 01:45:21.080 align:start position:0%
your area and coos
 
01:45:24.149 --> 01:45:24.159 align:start position:0%
that was ready to
 
01:45:26.629 --> 01:45:26.639 align:start position:0%
procure yeah that was your words so I'm
 
01:45:29.310 --> 01:45:29.320 align:start position:0%
trying to as is is that just mean that
 
01:45:31.750 --> 01:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
you need money to put this into
 
01:45:34.470 --> 01:45:34.480 align:start position:0%
action so um when I talk about
 
01:45:36.709 --> 01:45:36.719 align:start position:0%
procurement this is a partnership with
 
01:45:38.589 --> 01:45:38.599 align:start position:0%
our local producers as well as with our
 
01:45:40.750 --> 01:45:40.760 align:start position:0%
school food service and as part of our
 
01:45:44.350 --> 01:45:44.360 align:start position:0%
action planning Grant we were able to um
 
01:45:47.430 --> 01:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
really research and identify in in our
 
01:45:49.189 --> 01:45:49.199 align:start position:0%
area this Andrew scogan Valley region
 
01:45:50.990 --> 01:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
that includes those schools how many
 
01:45:52.990 --> 01:45:53.000 align:start position:0%
farms do we have that would be working
 
01:45:54.430 --> 01:45:54.440 align:start position:0%
with us and there are actually 14 that
 
01:45:56.950 --> 01:45:56.960 align:start position:0%
express interest as well as what do our
 
01:46:00.629 --> 01:46:00.639 align:start position:0%
food service directors need to purchase
 
01:46:04.669 --> 01:46:04.679 align:start position:0%
the food to um to um prepare the food
 
01:46:06.589 --> 01:46:06.599 align:start position:0%
the types of equipment that they need
 
01:46:08.109 --> 01:46:08.119 align:start position:0%
and so we're able to do that with some
 
01:46:10.229 --> 01:46:10.239 align:start position:0%
of the grants that we have available but
 
01:46:12.189 --> 01:46:12.199 align:start position:0%
what what I'm what we're finding is that
 
01:46:14.310 --> 01:46:14.320 align:start position:0%
sometimes our food service really needs
 
01:46:17.070 --> 01:46:17.080 align:start position:0%
that kick in the butt if I could say
 
01:46:19.990 --> 01:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
that um and this pilot project could
 
01:46:22.709 --> 01:46:22.719 align:start position:0%
really help help us do that in the North
 
01:46:25.750 --> 01:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
Country okay
 
01:46:29.709 --> 01:46:29.719 align:start position:0%
follow so what's the kick in the butt
 
01:46:31.830 --> 01:46:31.840 align:start position:0%
then is just that the program is there
 
01:46:33.830 --> 01:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
or does it still need funding well I
 
01:46:35.990 --> 01:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
think it is funding I mean it is trying
 
01:46:38.149 --> 01:46:38.159 align:start position:0%
to buy those additional um Local Foods
 
01:46:40.950 --> 01:46:40.960 align:start position:0%
because they are expensive okay thank
 
01:46:43.990 --> 01:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
you represent Belcher thank you Mr chair
 
01:46:46.030 --> 01:46:46.040 align:start position:0%
and thank you for your testimony uh
 
01:46:47.830 --> 01:46:47.840 align:start position:0%
quick question do we have any idea
 
01:46:50.070 --> 01:46:50.080 align:start position:0%
currently in terms of percentages what
 
01:46:51.990 --> 01:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
amount of food served in New Hampshire
 
01:46:55.030 --> 01:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
schools is sourced from New
 
01:46:57.870 --> 01:46:57.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so if I I don't know if I can
 
01:47:00.830 --> 01:47:00.840 align:start position:0%
ask Stacy to to share that but I I don't
 
01:47:02.830 --> 01:47:02.840 align:start position:0%
have that answer but we can probably get
 
01:47:05.270 --> 01:47:05.280 align:start position:0%
that to you great thank you are further
 
01:47:06.750 --> 01:47:06.760 align:start position:0%
question represent
 
01:47:09.750 --> 01:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
cascaden thank you uh and thank you um
 
01:47:12.310 --> 01:47:12.320 align:start position:0%
Heidi for taking my question is there a
 
01:47:14.470 --> 01:47:14.480 align:start position:0%
definition in the in the distance of
 
01:47:17.350 --> 01:47:17.360 align:start position:0%
what local means because I'm referencing
 
01:47:20.910 --> 01:47:20.920 align:start position:0%
the 10 acre Hydroponics of lettuce being
 
01:47:26.430 --> 01:47:26.440 align:start position:0%
open in the North Country um this spring
 
01:47:29.750 --> 01:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
and if somebody from Nashua wanted to
 
01:47:32.310 --> 01:47:32.320 align:start position:0%
partner with North Country Growers for
 
01:47:34.589 --> 01:47:34.599 align:start position:0%
the greens would that be considered
 
01:47:36.910 --> 01:47:36.920 align:start position:0%
local so that's another great question
 
01:47:39.109 --> 01:47:39.119 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative
 
01:47:41.510 --> 01:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
cascaden what we did and we were able to
 
01:47:43.310 --> 01:47:43.320 align:start position:0%
do with the last planning Grant is that
 
01:47:45.270 --> 01:47:45.280 align:start position:0%
we actually were able to Define what
 
01:47:48.109 --> 01:47:48.119 align:start position:0%
local means to us and and so that's
 
01:47:49.870 --> 01:47:49.880 align:start position:0%
within our Network and the work that
 
01:47:51.709 --> 01:47:51.719 align:start position:0%
we're doing with this Farm to school
 
01:47:53.990 --> 01:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
project and our definition is
 
01:47:56.070 --> 01:47:56.080 align:start position:0%
progressing to the rest of New Hampshire
 
01:47:59.550 --> 01:47:59.560 align:start position:0%
and then adjacent States within 100 mile
 
01:48:02.109 --> 01:48:02.119 align:start position:0%
radius so I don't know if that is in
 
01:48:04.350 --> 01:48:04.360 align:start position:0%
conflict with this particular bill but
 
01:48:06.990 --> 01:48:07.000 align:start position:0%
that's how we're doing trying to work
 
01:48:08.350 --> 01:48:08.360 align:start position:0%
with some of the farmers that and
 
01:48:11.070 --> 01:48:11.080 align:start position:0%
producers that are close to us yeah we
 
01:48:13.950 --> 01:48:13.960 align:start position:0%
will be addressing local okay good good
 
01:48:16.550 --> 01:48:16.560 align:start position:0%
excellent doesn't that resolve the
 
01:48:19.030 --> 01:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
situation of the Upper Valley or anybody
 
01:48:21.470 --> 01:48:21.480 align:start position:0%
on the borders because of the 100
 
01:48:23.589 --> 01:48:23.599 align:start position:0%
mile yes there there are a number of
 
01:48:25.070 --> 01:48:25.080 align:start position:0%
farms there's like four corner farm
 
01:48:27.070 --> 01:48:27.080 align:start position:0%
right across the river from us right in
 
01:48:30.950 --> 01:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
newbur right is a huge farm that sells
 
01:48:33.669 --> 01:48:33.679 align:start position:0%
all over that's right thank you yeah so
 
01:48:36.229 --> 01:48:36.239 align:start position:0%
uh are there any further questions thank
 
01:48:37.430 --> 01:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
you very much all right thank you I
 
01:48:40.589 --> 01:48:40.599 align:start position:0%
appreciate your time Robert
 
01:48:44.470 --> 01:48:44.480 align:start position:0%
Johnson from New Hampshire Farm
 
01:48:47.149 --> 01:48:47.159 align:start position:0%
Bureau thank
 
01:48:51.589 --> 01:48:51.599 align:start position:0%
you looking up the definition of local
 
01:48:54.149 --> 01:48:54.159 align:start position:0%
here when you find out where it is let
 
01:48:54.159 --> 01:48:55.510 align:start position:0%
here when you find out where it is let
us

01:48:55.510 --> 01:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:48:59.950 --> 01:48:59.960 align:start position:0%
know RSA 426 col5 for for the record my
 
01:49:02.189 --> 01:49:02.199 align:start position:0%
name is Rob Johnson representing Fierro
 
01:49:05.070 --> 01:49:05.080 align:start position:0%
is the federation's policy director and
 
01:49:08.310 --> 01:49:08.320 align:start position:0%
we are in support we this uh we see this
 
01:49:10.430 --> 01:49:10.440 align:start position:0%
is an improvement over past bills that
 
01:49:12.229 --> 01:49:12.239 align:start position:0%
you have seen this is the third one I
 
01:49:14.950 --> 01:49:14.960 align:start position:0%
believe we particularly like that is it
 
01:49:19.030 --> 01:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
is a pilot as we have suggested we we we
 
01:49:22.229 --> 01:49:22.239 align:start position:0%
want to ensure that in is to many the
 
01:49:24.910 --> 01:49:24.920 align:start position:0%
questions it increases current local
 
01:49:27.350 --> 01:49:27.360 align:start position:0%
food and it is not simply a
 
01:49:29.390 --> 01:49:29.400 align:start position:0%
reimbursement uh for what is already
 
01:49:31.910 --> 01:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
happening and we believe that the pilot
 
01:49:34.709 --> 01:49:34.719 align:start position:0%
will will help us get get to that point
 
01:49:37.070 --> 01:49:37.080 align:start position:0%
we also like that this this version is
 
01:49:38.870 --> 01:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
been administered by the Department of
 
01:49:40.750 --> 01:49:40.760 align:start position:0%
Agriculture previous versions were
 
01:49:41.990 --> 01:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
administered by the Department of
 
01:49:44.709 --> 01:49:44.719 align:start position:0%
Education there are two specific pieces
 
01:49:46.189 --> 01:49:46.199 align:start position:0%
in the bill that we would like to see
 
01:49:48.510 --> 01:49:48.520 align:start position:0%
changed and I I the chair has already
 
01:49:49.910 --> 01:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
indicated you'll be looking closely at
 
01:49:52.109 --> 01:49:52.119 align:start position:0%
one but it maybe in a different light
 
01:49:54.870 --> 01:49:54.880 align:start position:0%
than we are suggesting but on page two
 
01:49:58.830 --> 01:49:58.840 align:start position:0%
line nine where there's this uh the uh
 
01:50:02.229 --> 01:50:02.239 align:start position:0%
uh eligibility for reimbursements for uh
 
01:50:04.709 --> 01:50:04.719 align:start position:0%
16.6% from of food from other New
 
01:50:07.109 --> 01:50:07.119 align:start position:0%
England states we believe that is too
 
01:50:10.390 --> 01:50:10.400 align:start position:0%
broad uh that it that it uh I we would
 
01:50:12.310 --> 01:50:12.320 align:start position:0%
say we support the definition of local
 
01:50:14.270 --> 01:50:14.280 align:start position:0%
with the where New Hampshire taxpayer
 
01:50:15.669 --> 01:50:15.679 align:start position:0%
money should be going to purchase food
 
01:50:17.189 --> 01:50:17.199 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire Farmers your
 
01:50:19.870 --> 01:50:19.880 align:start position:0%
constituents that would be that's our
 
01:50:21.910 --> 01:50:21.920 align:start position:0%
and the second piece that we would uh
 
01:50:26.910 --> 01:50:26.920 align:start position:0%
like to see changed is or um page one
 
01:50:29.030 --> 01:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
line nine and 10 it says a selection
 
01:50:31.629 --> 01:50:31.639 align:start position:0%
committee will be assembled by the by
 
01:50:33.830 --> 01:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
the Department of Agriculture and and we
 
01:50:36.070 --> 01:50:36.080 align:start position:0%
would hope that in in and the the
 
01:50:37.990 --> 01:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
ensuing list is a suggestion to the
 
01:50:40.229 --> 01:50:40.239 align:start position:0%
commissioner but we'd also like to see a
 
01:50:42.709 --> 01:50:42.719 align:start position:0%
farmer or farmer repres representative
 
01:50:44.830 --> 01:50:44.840 align:start position:0%
added we believe this will enhance
 
01:50:47.390 --> 01:50:47.400 align:start position:0%
communication and understanding of of
 
01:50:50.030 --> 01:50:50.040 align:start position:0%
the way the the the food chain works
 
01:50:52.109 --> 01:50:52.119 align:start position:0%
works both ways with Farmers
 
01:50:54.069 --> 01:50:54.079 align:start position:0%
understanding the program and and uh you
 
01:50:56.109 --> 01:50:56.119 align:start position:0%
know the the the others understanding
 
01:50:57.790 --> 01:50:57.800 align:start position:0%
the farmer end of
 
01:51:00.870 --> 01:51:00.880 align:start position:0%
it thank you for your time and
 
01:51:03.870 --> 01:51:03.880 align:start position:0%
attention I'll leave it at that very
 
01:51:06.990 --> 01:51:07.000 align:start position:0%
timely well done well are there any
 
01:51:09.510 --> 01:51:09.520 align:start position:0%
questions for the Farm Bureau do you
 
01:51:11.750 --> 01:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
have a list of you know of of farms
 
01:51:14.550 --> 01:51:14.560 align:start position:0%
where are are or does maybe commissioner
 
01:51:16.589 --> 01:51:16.599 align:start position:0%
Jasper have that of farms which may be
 
01:51:18.390 --> 01:51:18.400 align:start position:0%
very interested in participating in a
 
01:51:21.470 --> 01:51:21.480 align:start position:0%
type of program like this
 
01:51:24.390 --> 01:51:24.400 align:start position:0%
uh we could certainly provide a list
 
01:51:26.910 --> 01:51:26.920 align:start position:0%
when something like this is is is
 
01:51:29.709 --> 01:51:29.719 align:start position:0%
developed um we
 
01:51:31.470 --> 01:51:31.480 align:start position:0%
could thank you I mean we have a
 
01:51:33.189 --> 01:51:33.199 align:start position:0%
membership list but that's not something
 
01:51:35.830 --> 01:51:35.840 align:start position:0%
we normally would would cast wide um
 
01:51:38.030 --> 01:51:38.040 align:start position:0%
right but we we could provide a thank
 
01:51:40.430 --> 01:51:40.440 align:start position:0%

01:57:03.790 --> 01:57:03.800 align:start position:0%
most samples were sorely
 
01:57:06.790 --> 01:57:06.800 align:start position:0%
deficient oh you got to be kidding
 
01:57:08.950 --> 01:57:08.960 align:start position:0%
me all right
 
01:57:12.350 --> 01:57:12.360 align:start position:0%
so I believe our kids deserve better I
 
01:57:13.870 --> 01:57:13.880 align:start position:0%
know the produce that we grow at our
 
01:57:15.870 --> 01:57:15.880 align:start position:0%
farm is done without any persistent
 
01:57:15.880 --> 01:57:16.990 align:start position:0%
farm is done without any persistent

01:57:19.550 --> 01:57:19.560 align:start position:0%
toxins I was on the early stages of it's
 
01:57:20.709 --> 01:57:20.719 align:start position:0%
called the New Hampshire feeding New
 
01:57:22.669 --> 01:57:22.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire program where food pantries
 
01:57:25.149 --> 01:57:25.159 align:start position:0%
around the state can get funding from
 
01:57:27.229 --> 01:57:27.239 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire food bank to pay local
 
01:57:30.750 --> 01:57:30.760 align:start position:0%

01:57:30.760 --> 01:57:32.270 align:start position:0%
producers for their products we use this
system

01:57:32.270 --> 01:57:32.280 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:57:35.669 --> 01:57:35.679 align:start position:0%
sell after our CSA picks up and we have
 
01:57:37.750 --> 01:57:37.760 align:start position:0%
leftover produce is that a written
 
01:57:39.510 --> 01:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
testimony that you could present to us
 
01:57:42.270 --> 01:57:42.280 align:start position:0%
just summarize we've got that yep so can
 
01:57:45.149 --> 01:57:45.159 align:start position:0%
you summarize I think there's been good
 
01:57:47.390 --> 01:57:47.400 align:start position:0%
information here regarding what's been
 
01:57:49.430 --> 01:57:49.440 align:start position:0%
put on the ground or in the ground and
 
01:57:52.589 --> 01:57:52.599 align:start position:0%
what we're eating yes um so we may have
 
01:57:55.350 --> 01:57:55.360 align:start position:0%
some questions for you on that
 
01:57:57.950 --> 01:57:57.960 align:start position:0%
okay you're welcome to take questions I
 
01:58:00.990 --> 01:58:01.000 align:start position:0%
have one um how do we sort this out in
 
01:58:02.709 --> 01:58:02.719 align:start position:0%
terms of how do we know which local
 
01:58:05.149 --> 01:58:05.159 align:start position:0%
farms are doing this or not doing this
 
01:58:05.159 --> 01:58:07.069 align:start position:0%
farms are doing this or not doing this
and

01:58:07.069 --> 01:58:07.079 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:58:11.470 --> 01:58:11.480 align:start position:0%
H and if these standards are you know
 
01:58:12.990 --> 01:58:13.000 align:start position:0%
the if the standard that you're
 
01:58:15.430 --> 01:58:15.440 align:start position:0%
advocating here it may not be that of
 
01:58:19.990 --> 01:58:20.000 align:start position:0%
USDA I don't know but how do we control
 
01:58:21.870 --> 01:58:21.880 align:start position:0%
what's coming in locally is there some
 
01:58:25.229 --> 01:58:25.239 align:start position:0%
oversight of that of you know what farm
 
01:58:27.990 --> 01:58:28.000 align:start position:0%
a over here is doing and they're
 
01:58:29.470 --> 01:58:29.480 align:start position:0%
eligible for participation in the
 
01:58:31.189 --> 01:58:31.199 align:start position:0%
program how do we ensure that what's
 
01:58:34.750 --> 01:58:34.760 align:start position:0%
been done is correctly done by law uh
 
01:58:37.790 --> 01:58:37.800 align:start position:0%
certified organic farms uh certified
 
01:58:40.669 --> 01:58:40.679 align:start position:0%
through the USDA uh are not allowed to
 
01:58:44.030 --> 01:58:44.040 align:start position:0%
use uh any of the uh anything like
 
01:58:47.390 --> 01:58:47.400 align:start position:0%
Roundup or a lot of these other um
 
01:58:49.910 --> 01:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
persistent synthetic toxins
 
01:58:52.030 --> 01:58:52.040 align:start position:0%
uh during production so that's one way
 
01:58:53.870 --> 01:58:53.880 align:start position:0%
to tell if you're certified
 
01:58:56.589 --> 01:58:56.599 align:start position:0%
organic we grow to organic standards but
 
01:58:59.189 --> 01:58:59.199 align:start position:0%
we're not certified so there's a lot of
 
01:59:01.910 --> 01:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
farms around the state like
 
01:59:04.310 --> 01:59:04.320 align:start position:0%
us um for one reason or another they
 
01:59:06.109 --> 01:59:06.119 align:start position:0%
choose not to get certified through the
 
01:59:08.709 --> 01:59:08.719 align:start position:0%
USDA but we still adhere to the
 
01:59:11.950 --> 01:59:11.960 align:start position:0%
standards so it it comes down to knowing
 
01:59:15.069 --> 01:59:15.079 align:start position:0%
your farmer uh knowing their
 
01:59:18.709 --> 01:59:18.719 align:start position:0%
operation um and trusting them I mean
 
01:59:20.390 --> 01:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
that's so
 
01:59:22.990 --> 01:59:23.000 align:start position:0%
you know know your farmer get go out and
 
01:59:25.830 --> 01:59:25.840 align:start position:0%
ask them how they do business you know
 
01:59:27.910 --> 01:59:27.920 align:start position:0%
and uh same thing could be applied in
 
01:59:30.310 --> 01:59:30.320 align:start position:0%
this uh this school system you know
 
01:59:32.709 --> 01:59:32.719 align:start position:0%
schools people in the schools get to
 
01:59:35.589 --> 01:59:35.599 align:start position:0%
know the local producers how they how
 
01:59:35.599 --> 01:59:37.229 align:start position:0%
know the local producers how they how
they

01:59:37.229 --> 01:59:37.239 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:59:40.149 --> 01:59:40.159 align:start position:0%
grow thank you questions representative
 
01:59:41.790 --> 01:59:41.800 align:start position:0%
leus and then representative
 
01:59:44.910 --> 01:59:44.920 align:start position:0%
pel I know nationally there's a term
 
01:59:48.069 --> 01:59:48.079 align:start position:0%
called natural that is people like your
 
01:59:49.870 --> 01:59:49.880 align:start position:0%
farm that follow
 
01:59:53.950 --> 01:59:53.960 align:start position:0%
the organic rules but does not um don't
 
01:59:56.030 --> 01:59:56.040 align:start position:0%
get certified for a variety of reasons
 
02:00:00.430 --> 02:00:00.440 align:start position:0%
like cost um do you know if that's in
 
02:00:03.750 --> 02:00:03.760 align:start position:0%
place here in New Hampshire that term
 
02:00:08.030 --> 02:00:08.040 align:start position:0%
and definition there is a a group um
 
02:00:10.350 --> 02:00:10.360 align:start position:0%
called certified naturally grown and we
 
02:00:14.310 --> 02:00:14.320 align:start position:0%
actually used to um belong to that group
 
02:00:19.310 --> 02:00:19.320 align:start position:0%
and um it's kind of like a Grassroots
 
02:00:23.109 --> 02:00:23.119 align:start position:0%
alternative to USDA organic it's less
 
02:00:25.390 --> 02:00:25.400 align:start position:0%
expensive uh you still get
 
02:00:29.350 --> 02:00:29.360 align:start position:0%
inspected uh on on a yearly basis so
 
02:00:32.430 --> 02:00:32.440 align:start position:0%
it's similar to the National program but
 
02:00:34.470 --> 02:00:34.480 align:start position:0%
just less paperwork
 
02:00:36.629 --> 02:00:36.639 align:start position:0%
required uh by the
 
02:00:40.350 --> 02:00:40.360 align:start position:0%
farmer uh less recordkeeping things like
 
02:00:43.310 --> 02:00:43.320 align:start position:0%
that um it's it's very similar but just
 
02:00:44.510 --> 02:00:44.520 align:start position:0%
kind of like
 
02:00:46.910 --> 02:00:46.920 align:start position:0%
a a little easier
 
02:00:49.910 --> 02:00:49.920 align:start position:0%
version um there are a few people in the
 
02:00:54.030 --> 02:00:54.040 align:start position:0%
state still certifi through CNG that I'm
 
02:00:57.430 --> 02:00:57.440 align:start position:0%
aware of but it's not wildly widely
 
02:01:02.430 --> 02:01:02.440 align:start position:0%
known or um talked about up up in these
 
02:01:05.390 --> 02:01:05.400 align:start position:0%
parts of the country okay thank you yep
 
02:01:08.149 --> 02:01:08.159 align:start position:0%
representative P thank you Mr chair
 
02:01:10.350 --> 02:01:10.360 align:start position:0%
thank you um you mentioned
 
02:01:14.189 --> 02:01:14.199 align:start position:0%
wheat um and that wheat products are
 
02:01:18.149 --> 02:01:18.159 align:start position:0%
ubiquitous yes we can't es I when you're
 
02:01:21.189 --> 02:01:21.199 align:start position:0%
trying to mat feed a large number of
 
02:01:23.629 --> 02:01:23.639 align:start position:0%
people it's almost impossible to avoid
 
02:01:28.030 --> 02:01:28.040 align:start position:0%
feeding wheat to people anywhere right
 
02:01:31.350 --> 02:01:31.360 align:start position:0%
so do we have any Wheat farmers in New
 
02:01:33.910 --> 02:01:33.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm just curious because that
 
02:01:35.229 --> 02:01:35.239 align:start position:0%
that's that's a
 
02:01:37.830 --> 02:01:37.840 align:start position:0%
significant um
 
02:01:41.629 --> 02:01:41.639 align:start position:0%
uh source of the glyphosphate yeah
 
02:01:44.669 --> 02:01:44.679 align:start position:0%
problems right I I am not aware of any
 
02:01:47.069 --> 02:01:47.079 align:start position:0%
perhaps Rob from the Farm Bureau has a
 
02:01:49.790 --> 02:01:49.800 align:start position:0%
better um understanding there uh we
 
02:01:51.950 --> 02:01:51.960 align:start position:0%
don't tend to grow a lot of grains in
 
02:01:54.069 --> 02:01:54.079 align:start position:0%
New England we just don't have the the
 
02:01:57.270 --> 02:01:57.280 align:start position:0%
acreage um but I'm sure there's somebody
 
02:02:01.470 --> 02:02:01.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:05.149 --> 02:02:05.159 align:start position:0%
um see a lot of corn
 
02:02:07.310 --> 02:02:07.320 align:start position:0%
yeah further
 
02:02:10.629 --> 02:02:10.639 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much thank
 
02:02:17.950 --> 02:02:17.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:17.960 --> 02:02:31.149 align:start position:0%
 
theay

02:02:31.149 --> 02:02:31.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:32.350 --> 02:02:32.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you to
 
02:02:34.390 --> 02:02:34.400 align:start position:0%
the committee for letting me speak today
 
02:02:36.270 --> 02:02:36.280 align:start position:0%
um I will definitely keep it very brief
 
02:02:37.870 --> 02:02:37.880 align:start position:0%
I'll read the for the testimony I just
 
02:02:39.270 --> 02:02:39.280 align:start position:0%
handed out there's some extra copies
 
02:02:40.830 --> 02:02:40.840 align:start position:0%
that will be there um but if you can
 
02:02:42.030 --> 02:02:42.040 align:start position:0%
make sure every rep gets one I'd
 
02:02:43.550 --> 02:02:43.560 align:start position:0%
appreciate it I'm going to read the
 
02:02:45.030 --> 02:02:45.040 align:start position:0%
first paragraph and the last two
 
02:02:46.990 --> 02:02:47.000 align:start position:0%
paragraphs and I'll take any questions
 
02:02:48.430 --> 02:02:48.440 align:start position:0%
and I might be I took some notes I might
 
02:02:49.990 --> 02:02:50.000 align:start position:0%
be able to clarify by some of the uh
 
02:02:51.390 --> 02:02:51.400 align:start position:0%
other questions that were previously
 
02:02:54.310 --> 02:02:54.320 align:start position:0%
asked but um as my colleague mentioned
 
02:02:55.830 --> 02:02:55.840 align:start position:0%
yesterday new hampsher Solutions

residents that improve that includes
 
02:03:18.430 --> 02:03:18.440 align:start position:0%
improving our food system and making
 
02:03:19.990 --> 02:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
sure that everyone is well educated on
 
02:03:21.310 --> 02:03:21.320 align:start position:0%
how our food system works and how to
 
02:03:23.550 --> 02:03:23.560 align:start position:0%
make it robust and
 
02:03:26.310 --> 02:03:26.320 align:start position:0%
resilient um extensive research shows
 
02:03:28.109 --> 02:03:28.119 align:start position:0%
that access to food in school is
 
02:03:30.669 --> 02:03:30.679 align:start position:0%
essential uh to students having positive
 
02:03:32.750 --> 02:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
health and educational outcomes uh Farm
 
02:03:36.189 --> 02:03:36.199 align:start position:0%
to school increases um food access in
 
02:03:37.790 --> 02:03:37.800 align:start position:0%
Schools benefits local economy and
 
02:03:39.350 --> 02:03:39.360 align:start position:0%
provides new educational opportunities
 
02:03:41.270 --> 02:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
for students these three things rarely
 
02:03:43.270 --> 02:03:43.280 align:start position:0%
intersect when establishing one policy a
 
02:03:45.109 --> 02:03:45.119 align:start position:0%
program but Farm to school helps achieve
 
02:03:46.830 --> 02:03:46.840 align:start position:0%
these three things for small investment
 
02:03:48.189 --> 02:03:48.199 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire can help facilitate the
 
02:03:49.870 --> 02:03:49.880 align:start position:0%
creation of new school programs around
 
02:03:51.390 --> 02:03:51.400 align:start position:0%
the state that can show a proof of
 
02:03:53.270 --> 02:03:53.280 align:start position:0%
concept for school districts and justify
 
02:03:54.830 --> 02:03:54.840 align:start position:0%
future investments in this ripe
 
02:03:57.589 --> 02:03:57.599 align:start position:0%
opportunity for communities and students
 
02:04:00.589 --> 02:04:00.599 align:start position:0%
um so we'd urge you to please uh vote a
 
02:04:02.830 --> 02:04:02.840 align:start position:0%
to pass and support House Bill
 
02:04:06.310 --> 02:04:06.320 align:start position:0%
1678 um I'll kind of briefly if I I
 
02:04:07.430 --> 02:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
probably have about a minute left I
 
02:04:08.589 --> 02:04:08.599 align:start position:0%
might be able to cover some of the
 
02:04:10.149 --> 02:04:10.159 align:start position:0%
questions that were asked so someone
 
02:04:10.159 --> 02:04:11.750 align:start position:0%
questions that were asked so someone
mentioned

02:04:11.750 --> 02:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
02:04:14.069 --> 02:04:14.079 align:start position:0%
um curriculum integration I believe it
 
02:04:16.030 --> 02:04:16.040 align:start position:0%
was representative PLL and a and a good
 
02:04:17.669 --> 02:04:17.679 align:start position:0%
robust Farm to school program will
 
02:04:20.030 --> 02:04:20.040 align:start position:0%
definitely integrate um Farm to school
 
02:04:21.950 --> 02:04:21.960 align:start position:0%
as part of health and science curriculum
 
02:04:23.470 --> 02:04:23.480 align:start position:0%
whether it's a community garden showing
 
02:04:26.069 --> 02:04:26.079 align:start position:0%
students how plants germinate and grow
 
02:04:27.510 --> 02:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
or if it's part of teaching students
 
02:04:29.390 --> 02:04:29.400 align:start position:0%
what kind of nutrients are essential and
 
02:04:30.990 --> 02:04:31.000 align:start position:0%
you know having a balanced diet those
 
02:04:32.350 --> 02:04:32.360 align:start position:0%
things will be integrated from an
 
02:04:34.270 --> 02:04:34.280 align:start position:0%
elementary level um hopefully all the
 
02:04:35.270 --> 02:04:35.280 align:start position:0%
way up through high school but
 
02:04:36.510 --> 02:04:36.520 align:start position:0%
definitely it's easier to integrate
 
02:04:39.510 --> 02:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
those into elementary schools um I
 
02:04:42.350 --> 02:04:42.360 align:start position:0%
believe some questions were asked about
 
02:04:45.709 --> 02:04:45.719 align:start position:0%
fed guides uh the federal
 
02:04:48.750 --> 02:04:48.760 align:start position:0%
guidelines for the USDA um
 
02:04:50.830 --> 02:04:50.840 align:start position:0%
reimbursements and so believe it was rep
 
02:04:54.390 --> 02:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
Bel asked that and um part of the reason
 
02:04:56.470 --> 02:04:56.480 align:start position:0%
for setting those federal guidelines um
 
02:04:58.270 --> 02:04:58.280 align:start position:0%
one we know that School meals are
 
02:04:59.950 --> 02:04:59.960 align:start position:0%
healthy they help students access the
 
02:05:02.270 --> 02:05:02.280 align:start position:0%
nutrition that they need and um the
 
02:05:03.950 --> 02:05:03.960 align:start position:0%
majority of nutrients that many students
 
02:05:05.470 --> 02:05:05.480 align:start position:0%
do receive during the school year or
 
02:05:09.069 --> 02:05:09.079 align:start position:0%
during the school day um and also it
 
02:05:10.990 --> 02:05:11.000 align:start position:0%
also by meeting the federal guidelines
 
02:05:12.470 --> 02:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
those meals can be reimbursed if the
 
02:05:13.589 --> 02:05:13.599 align:start position:0%
schools participate in the National
 
02:05:14.830 --> 02:05:14.840 align:start position:0%
School breakfast and school lunch
 
02:05:16.350 --> 02:05:16.360 align:start position:0%
program so that further makes so the
 
02:05:19.589 --> 02:05:19.599 align:start position:0%
dollars can be stretched with that all
 
02:05:21.270 --> 02:05:21.280 align:start position:0%
are there any questions representative
 
02:05:23.830 --> 02:05:23.840 align:start position:0%
Pell yes thank you Mr chair thank you
 
02:05:26.390 --> 02:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
for being here problem um I have a
 
02:05:28.069 --> 02:05:28.079 align:start position:0%
question about your organization does
 
02:05:30.350 --> 02:05:30.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Hunker Solutions actually
 
02:05:33.589 --> 02:05:33.599 align:start position:0%
distribute food throughout New Hampshire
 
02:05:35.390 --> 02:05:35.400 align:start position:0%
no we're we're an advocacy organization
 
02:05:37.750 --> 02:05:37.760 align:start position:0%
we help organize coalitions that work
 
02:05:39.549 --> 02:05:39.559 align:start position:0%
with organizations that are what we'
 
02:05:42.870 --> 02:05:42.880 align:start position:0%
call um direct service providers or like
 
02:05:44.790 --> 02:05:44.800 align:start position:0%
food pantries or we work with the New
 
02:05:46.030 --> 02:05:46.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire food bank on a number of
 
02:05:48.189 --> 02:05:48.199 align:start position:0%
initiatives but no our organization is
 
02:05:50.069 --> 02:05:50.079 align:start position:0%
not a direct service
 
02:05:52.030 --> 02:05:52.040 align:start position:0%
provider further questions
 
02:05:52.040 --> 02:05:53.830 align:start position:0%
provider further questions
representative

02:05:53.830 --> 02:05:53.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:05:55.790 --> 02:05:55.800 align:start position:0%
beler thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
02:05:58.830 --> 02:05:58.840 align:start position:0%
your testimony um I see some problems in
 
02:05:59.990 --> 02:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
this bill but I would think I would like
 
02:06:04.030 --> 02:06:04.040 align:start position:0%
to try to fix it if I can um so when we
 
02:06:06.990 --> 02:06:07.000 align:start position:0%
look at the specifically I I I touched
 
02:06:08.549 --> 02:06:08.559 align:start position:0%
briefly on this earlier when we look at
 
02:06:12.750 --> 02:06:12.760 align:start position:0%
the uh item on number six here all food
 
02:06:14.270 --> 02:06:14.280 align:start position:0%
purchase of this program shall comply
 
02:06:16.069 --> 02:06:16.079 align:start position:0%
with National School lunch program and
 
02:06:17.709 --> 02:06:17.719 align:start position:0%
federal Child Nutrition program
 
02:06:20.390 --> 02:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
guidelines and then we also know that
 
02:06:22.069 --> 02:06:22.079 align:start position:0%
because of the bidding process that is
 
02:06:24.709 --> 02:06:24.719 align:start position:0%
required as a part of that program it is
 
02:06:27.470 --> 02:06:27.480 align:start position:0%
El largely eliminated New Hampshire
 
02:06:30.069 --> 02:06:30.079 align:start position:0%
sources of food because of the pricing
 
02:06:33.669 --> 02:06:33.679 align:start position:0%
that's coming in uh would you agree that
 
02:06:35.549 --> 02:06:35.559 align:start position:0%
that this particular line actually is
 
02:06:37.149 --> 02:06:37.159 align:start position:0%
going to need to be modified otherwise
 
02:06:38.390 --> 02:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
we're going to wind up in a conflict
 
02:06:40.390 --> 02:06:40.400 align:start position:0%
between this law and federal law in
 
02:06:42.350 --> 02:06:42.360 align:start position:0%
which These funds probably cannot be
 
02:06:45.030 --> 02:06:45.040 align:start position:0%
expended in order to allow New Hampshire
 
02:06:48.669 --> 02:06:48.679 align:start position:0%
funds to actually be expended on this um
 
02:06:53.950 --> 02:06:53.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:56.589 --> 02:06:56.599 align:start position:0%
requirement I'm trying to think um and
 
02:07:01.030 --> 02:07:01.040 align:start position:0%
it's a good question um I'm not sure if
 
02:07:02.270 --> 02:07:02.280 align:start position:0%
Because the bidding
 
02:07:05.109 --> 02:07:05.119 align:start position:0%
requirement I'm trying toite it's the ug
 
02:07:07.149 --> 02:07:07.159 align:start position:0%
the universal
 
02:07:09.549 --> 02:07:09.559 align:start position:0%
um for how how the federal government
 
02:07:12.109 --> 02:07:12.119 align:start position:0%
regulates how um those who receive
 
02:07:15.069 --> 02:07:15.079 align:start position:0%
federal funds you know are able to uh to
 
02:07:17.149 --> 02:07:17.159 align:start position:0%
do purchases I can't remember what ug
 
02:07:19.069 --> 02:07:19.079 align:start position:0%
stands for but I'm not sure if the Child
 
02:07:21.589 --> 02:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
Nutrition program guidelines if those
 
02:07:23.390 --> 02:07:23.400 align:start position:0%
would include those bidding requirements
 
02:07:25.549 --> 02:07:25.559 align:start position:0%
I could be mistaken um I can do some
 
02:07:26.910 --> 02:07:26.920 align:start position:0%
more research though and get back to the
 
02:07:28.629 --> 02:07:28.639 align:start position:0%
committee on that I appreciate that
 
02:07:31.069 --> 02:07:31.079 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions from the
 
02:07:33.390 --> 02:07:33.400 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing thank you very much
 
02:07:35.629 --> 02:07:35.639 align:start position:0%
thanks and this does uh take us through
 
02:07:37.229 --> 02:07:37.239 align:start position:0%
our cards so we're going to close this
 
02:07:41.470 --> 02:07:41.480 align:start position:0%
hearing down HB 1678 and we're going to
 
02:07:43.669 --> 02:07:43.679 align:start position:0%
take a short five minute break for the
 
02:07:45.549 --> 02:07:45.559 align:start position:0%
committee to get up and stretch and
 
02:07:50.470 --> 02:07:50.480 align:start position:0%
we'll go into the next bill which is is
 
02:07:55.709 --> 02:07:55.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:58.470 --> 02:07:58.480 align:start position:0%
thereafter oh good that she put that
 
02:08:17.430 --> 02:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:17.440 --> 02:14:07.229 align:start position:0%
 
record

02:14:07.229 --> 02:14:07.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:10.270 --> 02:14:10.280 align:start position:0%
and uh the prime sponsor is here a
 
02:14:14.430 --> 02:14:14.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:17.910 --> 02:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
yours again for the record Alicia leus
 
02:14:20.870 --> 02:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro 38 Hudson and
 
02:14:23.790 --> 02:14:23.800 align:start position:0%
Lichfield um first thing I want to do is
 
02:14:26.149 --> 02:14:26.159 align:start position:0%
just ask a question of
 
02:14:26.159 --> 02:14:28.589 align:start position:0%
just ask a question of
the

02:14:28.589 --> 02:14:28.599 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:14:33.589 --> 02:14:33.599 align:start position:0%
well the people who are here um if you
 
02:14:38.189 --> 02:14:38.199 align:start position:0%
can show of hands how many here have
 
02:14:41.270 --> 02:14:41.280 align:start position:0%
never sent their children to private
 
02:14:44.069 --> 02:14:44.079 align:start position:0%
school if you have never sent your child
 
02:14:45.470 --> 02:14:45.480 align:start position:0%
to private
 
02:14:51.390 --> 02:14:51.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:54.669 --> 02:14:54.679 align:start position:0%
okay just trying to get an idea all
 
02:14:57.990 --> 02:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
right um what I'd like to
 
02:15:00.750 --> 02:15:00.760 align:start position:0%
do I if you'll allow me as a little bit
 
02:15:03.750 --> 02:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
of History because that will support my
 
02:15:05.790 --> 02:15:05.800 align:start position:0%
position on this bill and why I put this
 
02:15:05.800 --> 02:15:06.750 align:start position:0%
position on this bill and why I put this
bill

02:15:06.750 --> 02:15:06.760 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:15:06.760 --> 02:15:09.030 align:start position:0%
bill
in

02:15:09.030 --> 02:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:15:16.790 --> 02:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:22.229 --> 02:15:22.239 align:start position:0%
Constitution in the 90s and the early
 
02:15:25.030 --> 02:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
2000s there was a push across the
 
02:15:28.310 --> 02:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
country to try to change the way schools
 
02:15:28.320 --> 02:15:29.069 align:start position:0%
country to try to change the way schools
were

02:15:29.069 --> 02:15:29.079 align:start position:0%
were
 
02:15:32.790 --> 02:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
funded and in a lot of cases there were
 
02:15:37.510 --> 02:15:37.520 align:start position:0%
um courts who decided to step in and
 
02:15:39.510 --> 02:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
instead of allowing that to the
 
02:15:41.830 --> 02:15:41.840 align:start position:0%
legislators they decided they were going
 
02:15:45.229 --> 02:15:45.239 align:start position:0%
to interpret their state
 
02:15:45.239 --> 02:15:46.790 align:start position:0%
to interpret their state
constitutions

02:15:46.790 --> 02:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
constitutions
 
02:15:48.830 --> 02:15:48.840 align:start position:0%
um to
 
02:15:51.390 --> 02:15:51.400 align:start position:0%
mean what they wanted it to mean which
 
02:15:53.629 --> 02:15:53.639 align:start position:0%
was for the state to supply the funding
 
02:15:56.229 --> 02:15:56.239 align:start position:0%
rather than however it was in our case
 
02:15:59.910 --> 02:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:59.920 --> 02:16:02.870 align:start position:0%
 
funding

02:16:02.870 --> 02:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
funding
 
02:16:05.790 --> 02:16:05.800 align:start position:0%
and in our case in
 
02:16:09.629 --> 02:16:09.639 align:start position:0%
Claremont some judges decided that what
 
02:16:12.709 --> 02:16:12.719 align:start position:0%
our constitution meant was that the
 
02:16:15.990 --> 02:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
state had to fully fund educ
 
02:16:18.830 --> 02:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
education and there and
 
02:16:21.069 --> 02:16:21.079 align:start position:0%
I believe and there I am not alone in
 
02:16:22.430 --> 02:16:22.440 align:start position:0%
this there are a lot of people who
 
02:16:25.750 --> 02:16:25.760 align:start position:0%
believe that that was a misunderstanding
 
02:16:28.510 --> 02:16:28.520 align:start position:0%
and a misinterpretation of what the con
 
02:16:28.520 --> 02:16:30.549 align:start position:0%
and a misinterpretation of what the con
Constitution

02:16:30.549 --> 02:16:30.559 align:start position:0%
Constitution
 
02:16:33.709 --> 02:16:33.719 align:start position:0%
says uh it says it shall be the duty of
 
02:16:36.429 --> 02:16:36.439 align:start position:0%
the legislators and magistrates in all
 
02:16:38.950 --> 02:16:38.960 align:start position:0%
future periods of this government to
 
02:16:41.990 --> 02:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
cherish the interests of literature and
 
02:16:45.309 --> 02:16:45.319 align:start position:0%
the sciences and all seminaries and
 
02:16:48.309 --> 02:16:48.319 align:start position:0%
public schools to encourage
 
02:16:50.750 --> 02:16:50.760 align:start position:0%
private and public
 
02:16:53.469 --> 02:16:53.479 align:start position:0%
institutions rewards and immunities for
 
02:16:55.429 --> 02:16:55.439 align:start position:0%
the promotion of Agriculture Arts
 
02:16:58.349 --> 02:16:58.359 align:start position:0%
Sciences etc
 
02:17:03.190 --> 02:17:03.200 align:start position:0%
etc It also says provided nevertheless
 
02:17:05.589 --> 02:17:05.599 align:start position:0%
that no money raised by taxation shall
 
02:17:07.950 --> 02:17:07.960 align:start position:0%
ever be granted or applied for the use
 
02:17:10.709 --> 02:17:10.719 align:start position:0%
of the schools of institutions of any
 
02:17:13.549 --> 02:17:13.559 align:start position:0%
religious sect or
 
02:17:16.150 --> 02:17:16.160 align:start position:0%
denomination now their argument was that
 
02:17:18.669 --> 02:17:18.679 align:start position:0%
cherish meant to fully
 
02:17:18.679 --> 02:17:20.230 align:start position:0%
cherish meant to fully
fun

02:17:20.230 --> 02:17:20.240 align:start position:0%
fun
 
02:17:23.030 --> 02:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
however we're to cherish not just
 
02:17:26.190 --> 02:17:26.200 align:start position:0%
literature and the Sciences but all
 
02:17:28.870 --> 02:17:28.880 align:start position:0%
seminaries and public
 
02:17:32.270 --> 02:17:32.280 align:start position:0%
schools the definition of a
 
02:17:35.309 --> 02:17:35.319 align:start position:0%
seminary a School of Theology
 
02:17:37.790 --> 02:17:37.800 align:start position:0%
Theological Seminary or Divinity School
 
02:17:39.589 --> 02:17:39.599 align:start position:0%
is an educational institute for
 
02:17:42.070 --> 02:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
educating students in scripture and
 
02:17:44.509 --> 02:17:44.519 align:start position:0%
theology generally to prepare them for
 
02:17:46.870 --> 02:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
ordination to serve as clergy in
 
02:17:49.910 --> 02:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
academics or mostly in Christian
 
02:17:54.549 --> 02:17:54.559 align:start position:0%
Ministry and I would ask how can
 
02:17:58.270 --> 02:17:58.280 align:start position:0%
cherish mean fully fund when the first
 
02:18:00.950 --> 02:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
thing we're to cherish is
 
02:18:04.629 --> 02:18:04.639 align:start position:0%
seminaries now you might argue that well
 
02:18:07.870 --> 02:18:07.880 align:start position:0%
this Blain amendment was put in in
 
02:18:12.830 --> 02:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
1877 and our constitution was adopted in
 
02:18:14.990 --> 02:18:15.000 align:start position:0%
1784 and
 
02:18:18.870 --> 02:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
therefore they just overlooked that
 
02:18:22.349 --> 02:18:22.359 align:start position:0%
there was a conflict but I would say if
 
02:18:25.669 --> 02:18:25.679 align:start position:0%
that was the case if it was understood
 
02:18:28.270 --> 02:18:28.280 align:start position:0%
that cherish meant fully
 
02:18:32.790 --> 02:18:32.800 align:start position:0%
fund and seminaries was one of the all
 
02:18:34.589 --> 02:18:34.599 align:start position:0%
seminaries was one of the first things
 
02:18:38.110 --> 02:18:38.120 align:start position:0%
in there to be cherished and they put in
 
02:18:41.669 --> 02:18:41.679 align:start position:0%
that Amendment saying that any religious
 
02:18:45.070 --> 02:18:45.080 align:start position:0%
sector denomination could not be funded
 
02:18:48.469 --> 02:18:48.479 align:start position:0%
then why was nothing written
 
02:18:51.429 --> 02:18:51.439 align:start position:0%
about either moving
 
02:18:54.629 --> 02:18:54.639 align:start position:0%
seminaries removing seminaries from
 
02:18:54.639 --> 02:18:56.589 align:start position:0%
seminaries removing seminaries from
cherish

02:18:56.589 --> 02:18:56.599 align:start position:0%
cherish
 
02:19:01.549 --> 02:19:01.559 align:start position:0%
or um making that clear but nobody ever
 
02:19:03.870 --> 02:19:03.880 align:start position:0%
wrote that I mean I would be glad if one
 
02:19:06.150 --> 02:19:06.160 align:start position:0%
of you could come up with me arguments
 
02:19:11.230 --> 02:19:11.240 align:start position:0%
made at that time to say why we were
 
02:19:13.870 --> 02:19:13.880 align:start position:0%
supported why we were fully funding
 
02:19:15.709 --> 02:19:15.719 align:start position:0%
seminaries uh
 
02:19:18.509 --> 02:19:18.519 align:start position:0%
representative I'm continuing
 
02:19:20.270 --> 02:19:20.280 align:start position:0%
that is the point that is the point to
 
02:19:22.309 --> 02:19:22.319 align:start position:0%
this bill and I'm giving you the
 
02:19:25.549 --> 02:19:25.559 align:start position:0%
background or why why I think this bill
 
02:19:28.750 --> 02:19:28.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:28.760 --> 02:19:31.709 align:start position:0%
 
constitutional

02:19:31.709 --> 02:19:31.719 align:start position:0%
constitutional
 
02:19:35.910 --> 02:19:35.920 align:start position:0%
um so therefore I do not believe and
 
02:19:37.830 --> 02:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
there are many in the state who do not
 
02:19:39.669 --> 02:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
believe and there were many legislators
 
02:19:42.190 --> 02:19:42.200 align:start position:0%
at the time of that ruling that did not
 
02:19:44.750 --> 02:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
believe that cherish meant fully fund
 
02:19:47.709 --> 02:19:47.719 align:start position:0%
which is why it took so long and so much
 
02:19:49.429 --> 02:19:49.439 align:start position:0%
force and so many different rulings and
 
02:19:51.429 --> 02:19:51.439 align:start position:0%
court cases to try to force the
 
02:19:54.309 --> 02:19:54.319 align:start position:0%
legislature to come up with that because
 
02:19:55.790 --> 02:19:55.800 align:start position:0%
they did not believe that was what
 
02:20:00.150 --> 02:20:00.160 align:start position:0%
cherish meant and by basic logic the it
 
02:20:02.870 --> 02:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
does not it does not seem to mean
 
02:20:05.670 --> 02:20:05.680 align:start position:0%
that but that does not mean that the
 
02:20:09.510 --> 02:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
legislature can't decide okay so we on
 
02:20:13.230 --> 02:20:13.240 align:start position:0%
our own decide that we want to fully
 
02:20:16.670 --> 02:20:16.680 align:start position:0%
fund education because that's how we
 
02:20:20.750 --> 02:20:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:23.670 --> 02:20:23.680 align:start position:0%
education but we've seen over and over
 
02:20:25.750 --> 02:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
that when the state pays for things
 
02:20:28.670 --> 02:20:28.680 align:start position:0%
we're not supposed to differ not
 
02:20:32.030 --> 02:20:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:34.550 --> 02:20:34.560 align:start position:0%
um thank you
 
02:20:37.030 --> 02:20:37.040 align:start position:0%
discriminate was the word it wouldn't
 
02:20:40.510 --> 02:20:40.520 align:start position:0%
come um and we talked already about
 
02:20:41.910 --> 02:20:41.920 align:start position:0%
special needs and how we couldn't
 
02:20:43.830 --> 02:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
discriminate against special needs
 
02:20:47.510 --> 02:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
children well I would say that by only
 
02:20:50.230 --> 02:20:50.240 align:start position:0%
funding certain schools and not other
 
02:20:53.389 --> 02:20:53.399 align:start position:0%
schools we are in fact discriminating
 
02:20:55.270 --> 02:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
against students who can't learn a
 
02:21:00.349 --> 02:21:00.359 align:start position:0%
certain way students who go to a the
 
02:21:04.270 --> 02:21:04.280 align:start position:0%
their zip code school and that is not
 
02:21:07.309 --> 02:21:07.319 align:start position:0%
set up in the way that they are able to
 
02:21:11.110 --> 02:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
learn and therefore they need to go to
 
02:21:13.469 --> 02:21:13.479 align:start position:0%
maybe even just a different zip code
 
02:21:16.270 --> 02:21:16.280 align:start position:0%
school but maybe to a private school or
 
02:21:18.349 --> 02:21:18.359 align:start position:0%
whatever they need in order for them to
 
02:21:20.429 --> 02:21:20.439 align:start position:0%
learn and so we are
 
02:21:23.429 --> 02:21:23.439 align:start position:0%
discriminating by having zip code
 
02:21:25.950 --> 02:21:25.960 align:start position:0%
schools the
 
02:21:29.389 --> 02:21:29.399 align:start position:0%
efas were originally set up before it
 
02:21:34.309 --> 02:21:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:38.590 --> 02:21:38.600 align:start position:0%
kids to allow kids to get that education
 
02:21:41.630 --> 02:21:41.640 align:start position:0%
funded by the state the same money that
 
02:21:44.630 --> 02:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
goes to every other kid in the state was
 
02:21:47.990 --> 02:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
to go so that they could get their
 
02:21:50.110 --> 02:21:50.120 align:start position:0%
education based on what would work for
 
02:21:53.190 --> 02:21:53.200 align:start position:0%
them which includes their Public School
 
02:21:56.750 --> 02:21:56.760 align:start position:0%
other Public Schools um Charter Schools
 
02:22:00.870 --> 02:22:00.880 align:start position:0%
private schools home schools colleges
 
02:22:03.670 --> 02:22:03.680 align:start position:0%
you know whatever it took they would get
 
02:22:07.270 --> 02:22:07.280 align:start position:0%
their education and that is what is
 
02:22:07.280 --> 02:22:09.670 align:start position:0%
their education and that is what is
constitutionally

02:22:09.670 --> 02:22:09.680 align:start position:0%
constitutionally
 
02:22:13.270 --> 02:22:13.280 align:start position:0%
fair if the legislature decides that
 
02:22:15.429 --> 02:22:15.439 align:start position:0%
they are going to pay for education for
 
02:22:18.070 --> 02:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
students in the state it should go to
 
02:22:19.910 --> 02:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
make sure and educate every student in
 
02:22:21.990 --> 02:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
the state not just those that live in
 
02:22:24.910 --> 02:22:24.920 align:start position:0%
this ZIP code or that zip code we've had
 
02:22:26.830 --> 02:22:26.840 align:start position:0%
lots of conversations about how it
 
02:22:29.590 --> 02:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
shouldn't pertain to zip codes about
 
02:22:31.550 --> 02:22:31.560 align:start position:0%
that's why we want to fund this town or
 
02:22:33.389 --> 02:22:33.399 align:start position:0%
that town differently because it
 
02:22:35.110 --> 02:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
shouldn't pertain to zip codes well
 
02:22:37.389 --> 02:22:37.399 align:start position:0%
guess what efas don't pertain to zip
 
02:22:40.190 --> 02:22:40.200 align:start position:0%
codes they give a fair education
 
02:22:42.550 --> 02:22:42.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity for an education for every
 
02:22:45.110 --> 02:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
single kid in the state except then we
 
02:22:47.230 --> 02:22:47.240 align:start position:0%
put these limits on and said only if if
 
02:22:49.870 --> 02:22:49.880 align:start position:0%
you make below a certain amount of money
 
02:22:52.070 --> 02:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
whether or not it means that you can
 
02:22:55.349 --> 02:22:55.359 align:start position:0%
afford the education your child needs so
 
02:22:55.359 --> 02:22:56.190 align:start position:0%
afford the education your child needs so
this

02:22:56.190 --> 02:22:56.200 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:22:59.349 --> 02:22:59.359 align:start position:0%
bill which
 
02:23:03.389 --> 02:23:03.399 align:start position:0%
um applies to Universal eligibility for
 
02:23:06.150 --> 02:23:06.160 align:start position:0%
the education Freedom account program I
 
02:23:09.870 --> 02:23:09.880 align:start position:0%
would argue is the most constitutionally
 
02:23:14.349 --> 02:23:14.359 align:start position:0%
Fair Way of funding our students so that
 
02:23:17.750 --> 02:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
they each have that same amount of money
 
02:23:19.750 --> 02:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
regardless of who they are where they
 
02:23:22.190 --> 02:23:22.200 align:start position:0%
live they have that same amount of money
 
02:23:24.309 --> 02:23:24.319 align:start position:0%
provided by the state to get the
 
02:23:27.910 --> 02:23:27.920 align:start position:0%
education that they need thank
 
02:23:31.110 --> 02:23:31.120 align:start position:0%

02:23:33.150 --> 02:23:33.160 align:start position:0%

for presenting your bill here uh
 
02:23:42.389 --> 02:23:42.399 align:start position:0%
yesterday we had the executive director
 
02:23:43.429 --> 02:23:43.439 align:start position:0%
of The
 
02:23:46.790 --> 02:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
Children's Fund here and I asked her the
 
02:23:49.190 --> 02:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
question question of the purpose of the
 
02:23:52.429 --> 02:23:52.439 align:start position:0%
program and she confirmed before this
 
02:23:54.469 --> 02:23:54.479 align:start position:0%
committee that the purpose of the
 
02:23:57.910 --> 02:23:57.920 align:start position:0%
program is to provide opportunities
 
02:24:01.550 --> 02:24:01.560 align:start position:0%
for families within a certain category
 
02:24:01.560 --> 02:24:02.389 align:start position:0%
for families within a certain category
of

02:24:02.389 --> 02:24:02.399 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:24:06.190 --> 02:24:06.200 align:start position:0%
350% of the poverty level to be eligible
 
02:24:09.269 --> 02:24:09.279 align:start position:0%
that is the purpose of the program so
 
02:24:12.070 --> 02:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
would you concur with me that this
 
02:24:15.150 --> 02:24:15.160 align:start position:0%
program your proposal basically changes
 
02:24:17.790 --> 02:24:17.800 align:start position:0%
the purpose that was legislative by this
 
02:24:20.990 --> 02:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
legislature for this program I listened
 
02:24:23.550 --> 02:24:23.560 align:start position:0%
very carefully when she answered your
 
02:24:26.790 --> 02:24:26.800 align:start position:0%
question and she said as it is written
 
02:24:30.510 --> 02:24:30.520 align:start position:0%
now that is the purpose as the three as
 
02:24:32.309 --> 02:24:32.319 align:start position:0%
it's written as
 
02:24:35.070 --> 02:24:35.080 align:start position:0%
350% that is the purpose it was not the
 
02:24:38.349 --> 02:24:38.359 align:start position:0%
original purpose before it got
 
02:24:41.750 --> 02:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
amended original purpose was 300% no the
 
02:24:46.070 --> 02:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
original purpose was no cap whatsoever
 
02:24:50.429 --> 02:24:50.439 align:start position:0%
it got a mended to include a cap and to
 
02:24:53.590 --> 02:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
be for poor students only and so she
 
02:24:56.469 --> 02:24:56.479 align:start position:0%
very carefully answered as it is written
 
02:24:59.950 --> 02:24:59.960 align:start position:0%
now this is the purpose I am saying I am
 
02:25:03.030 --> 02:25:03.040 align:start position:0%
going back to the original which did not
 
02:25:05.469 --> 02:25:05.479 align:start position:0%
have a cap on it and was for every
 
02:25:07.910 --> 02:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
student in the state so the answer to my
 
02:25:10.750 --> 02:25:10.760 align:start position:0%
qu the answer to my question is
 
02:25:13.950 --> 02:25:13.960 align:start position:0%
yes the answer to my qu your question is
 
02:25:16.150 --> 02:25:16.160 align:start position:0%
that yes the purpose is back to its
 
02:25:16.160 --> 02:25:18.349 align:start position:0%
that yes the purpose is back to its
original

02:25:18.349 --> 02:25:18.359 align:start position:0%
original
 
02:25:20.550 --> 02:25:20.560 align:start position:0%
purpose further questions representative
 
02:25:22.830 --> 02:25:22.840 align:start position:0%
belshire thank you Mr chair I'll ask for
 
02:25:24.269 --> 02:25:24.279 align:start position:0%
just a moment of leeway this question
 
02:25:25.670 --> 02:25:25.680 align:start position:0%
we'll make sense in a
 
02:25:31.349 --> 02:25:31.359 align:start position:0%
moment so Civil Rights Act passed was
 
02:25:33.990 --> 02:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
held to be constitutional by the Supreme
 
02:25:35.070 --> 02:25:35.080 align:start position:0%
Court of the United States it was held
 
02:25:37.510 --> 02:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
to be constitutional because they
 
02:25:37.520 --> 02:25:39.269 align:start position:0%
to be constitutional because they
decided

02:25:39.269 --> 02:25:39.279 align:start position:0%
decided
 
02:25:41.870 --> 02:25:41.880 align:start position:0%
that um
 
02:25:44.750 --> 02:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
businesses are open to the public and
 
02:25:47.190 --> 02:25:47.200 align:start position:0%
therefore cannot discriminate against
 
02:25:48.990 --> 02:25:49.000 align:start position:0%
those coming from the public coming as
 
02:25:52.510 --> 02:25:52.520 align:start position:0%
they are now I say that because our
 
02:25:55.790 --> 02:25:55.800 align:start position:0%
Constitution doesn't Define Public
 
02:25:58.750 --> 02:25:58.760 align:start position:0%
School in New Hampshire so my question
 
02:26:02.590 --> 02:26:02.600 align:start position:0%
to you would be do you believe that
 
02:26:06.750 --> 02:26:06.760 align:start position:0%
public schools are only those schools
 
02:26:09.510 --> 02:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
who are operated by the government and
 
02:26:12.750 --> 02:26:12.760 align:start position:0%
government employees or are public
 
02:26:14.670 --> 02:26:14.680 align:start position:0%
schools perhaps better interpreted to be
 
02:26:17.349 --> 02:26:17.359 align:start position:0%
those schools who are open to the public
 
02:26:19.349 --> 02:26:19.359 align:start position:0%
justi as Supreme Court held in the Civil
 
02:26:19.359 --> 02:26:20.510 align:start position:0%
justi as Supreme Court held in the Civil
Rights

02:26:20.510 --> 02:26:20.520 align:start position:0%
Rights
 
02:26:22.750 --> 02:26:22.760 align:start position:0%
Act I think that would be a better
 
02:26:24.590 --> 02:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
definition and we should perhaps refer
 
02:26:26.309 --> 02:26:26.319 align:start position:0%
to what we call Public Schools as
 
02:26:26.319 --> 02:26:28.550 align:start position:0%
to what we call Public Schools as
Government

02:26:28.550 --> 02:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
Government
 
02:26:31.510 --> 02:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
schools thank you uh further questions
 
02:26:32.950 --> 02:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
representative cascad and maybe we can
 
02:26:34.670 --> 02:26:34.680 align:start position:0%
stick to the bill with our questions
 
02:26:38.750 --> 02:26:38.760 align:start position:0%
also I to thank you thank you um there's
 
02:26:41.070 --> 02:26:41.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of focus on your bill on this
 
02:26:41.080 --> 02:26:42.510 align:start position:0%
a lot of focus on your bill on this
constitution

02:26:42.510 --> 02:26:42.520 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
02:26:46.110 --> 02:26:46.120 align:start position:0%
obviously um and I'm just wondering if
 
02:26:50.990 --> 02:26:51.000 align:start position:0%
you understand or if you think um that
 
02:26:54.510 --> 02:26:54.520 align:start position:0%
the language that was used in the 16 and
 
02:26:57.510 --> 02:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
1700s may be different than what it is
 
02:27:00.590 --> 02:27:00.600 align:start position:0%
in the other centuries in terms of the
 
02:27:04.389 --> 02:27:04.399 align:start position:0%
word Seminary because if you I actually
 
02:27:05.910 --> 02:27:05.920 align:start position:0%
looked that up to see what the
 
02:27:08.590 --> 02:27:08.600 align:start position:0%
definition was then and it was a
 
02:27:11.870 --> 02:27:11.880 align:start position:0%
religious institution of education and
 
02:27:13.269 --> 02:27:13.279 align:start position:0%
there were many of them that were
 
02:27:15.550 --> 02:27:15.560 align:start position:0%
founded right about the same time as our
 
02:27:17.230 --> 02:27:17.240 align:start position:0%
constitution was
 
02:27:20.870 --> 02:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
okay I found different then thank
 
02:27:23.190 --> 02:27:23.200 align:start position:0%
you you want to take
 
02:27:26.750 --> 02:27:26.760 align:start position:0%
over further questions anyone uh seeing
 
02:27:28.750 --> 02:27:28.760 align:start position:0%
none thank you very much representative
 
02:27:32.510 --> 02:27:32.520 align:start position:0%
thank you uh next is Megan
 
02:27:44.110 --> 02:27:44.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:46.389 --> 02:27:46.399 align:start position:0%
here thank you I think it's still
 
02:27:48.269 --> 02:27:48.279 align:start position:0%
morning good morning members of
 
02:27:50.910 --> 02:27:50.920 align:start position:0%
Education morning uh my name is uh for
 
02:27:52.830 --> 02:27:52.840 align:start position:0%
the record my name is Megan Tuttle
 
02:27:54.389 --> 02:27:54.399 align:start position:0%
president NAA New Hampshire representing
 
02:27:57.670 --> 02:27:57.680 align:start position:0%
about 17,000 Educators across the state
 
02:28:00.110 --> 02:28:00.120 align:start position:0%
I'm here today to express our opposition
 
02:28:02.550 --> 02:28:02.560 align:start position:0%
to House Bill 1634 which would
 
02:28:04.429 --> 02:28:04.439 align:start position:0%
established Universal eligibility for
 
02:28:05.990 --> 02:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's education Freedom account
 
02:28:08.389 --> 02:28:08.399 align:start position:0%
voucher program as you're aware two
 
02:28:10.349 --> 02:28:10.359 align:start position:0%
recent Court decisions reaffirmed that
 
02:28:12.110 --> 02:28:12.120 align:start position:0%
the state is not meeting its obligations
 
02:28:14.349 --> 02:28:14.359 align:start position:0%
under our Constitution to provide an
 
02:28:16.790 --> 02:28:16.800 align:start position:0%
adequate Universal public education
 
02:28:18.070 --> 02:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
because the funding provided by the
 
02:28:20.030 --> 02:28:20.040 align:start position:0%
state is far too low you and other
 
02:28:21.830 --> 02:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
members of this committee are currently
 
02:28:23.469 --> 02:28:23.479 align:start position:0%
serving on a special subcommittee to
 
02:28:24.990 --> 02:28:25.000 align:start position:0%
look at legislation that could address
 
02:28:27.550 --> 02:28:27.560 align:start position:0%
those decisions but several bills being
 
02:28:29.670 --> 02:28:29.680 align:start position:0%
heard in House Education today beginning
 
02:28:32.070 --> 02:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
with House Bill 1634 would throw open
 
02:28:33.830 --> 02:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
the door to diverting more public funds
 
02:28:35.830 --> 02:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
for a second private school voucher
 
02:28:38.510 --> 02:28:38.520 align:start position:0%
education system where we still have yet
 
02:28:40.309 --> 02:28:40.319 align:start position:0%
to fulfill our state's obligation to
 
02:28:42.750 --> 02:28:42.760 align:start position:0%
adequately funding our public schools
 
02:28:44.269 --> 02:28:44.279 align:start position:0%
these voucher expansion bills would take
 
02:28:46.590 --> 02:28:46.600 align:start position:0%
us backwards rather than ensuring that
 
02:28:48.630 --> 02:28:48.640 align:start position:0%
that every child has a highquality
 
02:28:51.309 --> 02:28:51.319 align:start position:0%
public education that prepares them to
 
02:28:54.349 --> 02:28:54.359 align:start position:0%
succeed in the future host Bill 1634
 
02:28:55.670 --> 02:28:55.680 align:start position:0%
would divert hundreds of millions of
 
02:28:57.190 --> 02:28:57.200 align:start position:0%
public dollars toward a state voucher
 
02:28:58.990 --> 02:28:59.000 align:start position:0%
program that's unaccountable
 
02:29:00.510 --> 02:29:00.520 align:start position:0%
discriminatory and will not provide
 
02:29:02.590 --> 02:29:02.600 align:start position:0%
student achievement will ultimately harm
 
02:29:04.150 --> 02:29:04.160 align:start position:0%
all students by decimating our state's
 
02:29:06.510 --> 02:29:06.520 align:start position:0%
financial support for public schools
 
02:29:07.950 --> 02:29:07.960 align:start position:0%
states that have recently expanded their
 
02:29:10.110 --> 02:29:10.120 align:start position:0%
Voucher Program significantly or
 
02:29:12.550 --> 02:29:12.560 align:start position:0%
establish Universal eligibility provide
 
02:29:14.150 --> 02:29:14.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and this committee with a
 
02:29:15.870 --> 02:29:15.880 align:start position:0%
cautionary tale about the fiscal
 
02:29:17.429 --> 02:29:17.439 align:start position:0%
consequences of funding a second

education system a recent report from

Southern Poverty Law Center and the
 
02:29:26.030 --> 02:29:26.040 align:start position:0%
education Law Center explores how
 
02:29:27.630 --> 02:29:27.640 align:start position:0%
voucher programs and spending have
 
02:29:30.070 --> 02:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
evolved in seven states one of the
 
02:29:32.070 --> 02:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
consistent findings from the report
 
02:29:34.550 --> 02:29:34.560 align:start position:0%
informs us that the context in which the
 
02:29:36.349 --> 02:29:36.359 align:start position:0%
growth of voucher spending is occurring
 
02:29:38.750 --> 02:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
is important at the same time funding
 
02:29:40.750 --> 02:29:40.760 align:start position:0%
for vouchers has climbed considerably
 
02:29:42.309 --> 02:29:42.319 align:start position:0%
these voucher State's effort to fund
 
02:29:44.110 --> 02:29:44.120 align:start position:0%
public schools which serve a significant
 
02:29:46.349 --> 02:29:46.359 align:start position:0%
majority of students have declined we
 
02:29:47.510 --> 02:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
need need to look no further than
 
02:29:49.230 --> 02:29:49.240 align:start position:0%
Arizona which recently adopted a
 
02:29:51.349 --> 02:29:51.359 align:start position:0%
universal voucher program to warn us
 
02:29:54.110 --> 02:29:54.120 align:start position:0%
that this policy would be unwise in New
 
02:29:56.349 --> 02:29:56.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire reaching higher New Hampshire
 
02:29:58.150 --> 02:29:58.160 align:start position:0%
recent recently estimated that a
 
02:30:00.710 --> 02:30:00.720 align:start position:0%
universal voucher plan could cost 105
 
02:30:04.070 --> 02:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
million in fiscal year 2025 alone after
 
02:30:06.150 --> 02:30:06.160 align:start position:0%
the explosion of cine in Arizona let's
 
02:30:08.150 --> 02:30:08.160 align:start position:0%
not follow in their footsteps the state
 
02:30:10.070 --> 02:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire has a duty to better
 
02:30:13.389 --> 02:30:13.399 align:start position:0%
serve the 160,000 public school students
 
02:30:15.750 --> 02:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
of our state any shortfalls in the
 
02:30:17.550 --> 02:30:17.560 align:start position:0%
education Trust fund are required to be
 
02:30:19.590 --> 02:30:19.600 align:start position:0%
made up by the general fund which means
 
02:30:21.790 --> 02:30:21.800 align:start position:0%
an Arizona style expansion would mean
 
02:30:23.510 --> 02:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
other critical programs the state has
 
02:30:25.230 --> 02:30:25.240 align:start position:0%
outside of Education could be
 
02:30:27.389 --> 02:30:27.399 align:start position:0%
jeopardized without any kind of Revenue
 
02:30:30.190 --> 02:30:30.200 align:start position:0%
source for the second education system
 
02:30:31.750 --> 02:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
already New Hampshire is projected to
 
02:30:33.670 --> 02:30:33.680 align:start position:0%
spend more than accounted for in this
 
02:30:35.550 --> 02:30:35.560 align:start position:0%
voucher program in this fiscal year
 
02:30:37.670 --> 02:30:37.680 align:start position:0%
largely new state spending because like
 
02:30:39.630 --> 02:30:39.640 align:start position:0%
Arizona more than 3qu qus of the
 
02:30:41.030 --> 02:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
students enrolled in the voucher program
 
02:30:43.070 --> 02:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
were already in private or non-public
 
02:30:45.070 --> 02:30:45.080 align:start position:0%
school setting instead of sending
 
02:30:46.630 --> 02:30:46.640 align:start position:0%
taxpayer money to private schools we
 
02:30:48.349 --> 02:30:48.359 align:start position:0%
should be focusing on our Public Schools
 
02:30:50.870 --> 02:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
where nearly 90% of our children attend
 
02:30:52.790 --> 02:30:52.800 align:start position:0%
not taking money away from them we need
 
02:30:54.910 --> 02:30:54.920 align:start position:0%
to reduce class sizes we need to give
 
02:30:56.830 --> 02:30:56.840 align:start position:0%
our students more one-on-one attention
 
02:30:58.429 --> 02:30:58.439 align:start position:0%
we need to increase salaries to address
 
02:31:00.870 --> 02:31:00.880 align:start position:0%
the teacher and staff shortages with
 
02:31:02.910 --> 02:31:02.920 align:start position:0%
these questions and concerns in mind and
 
02:31:04.469 --> 02:31:04.479 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire respectfully ask the house
 
02:31:06.670 --> 02:31:06.680 align:start position:0%
education committee to find House Bill
 
02:31:09.349 --> 02:31:09.359 align:start position:0%
1634 and expedience to legislate I
 
02:31:10.910 --> 02:31:10.920 align:start position:0%
appreciate your time and attention in
 
02:31:12.590 --> 02:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
reviewing our comments I do have written
 
02:31:13.830 --> 02:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
and I'll be happy to take question thank
 
02:31:15.429 --> 02:31:15.439 align:start position:0%
you very much are there questions from
 
02:31:18.950 --> 02:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
the committee represent dry thank you Mr
 
02:31:22.590 --> 02:31:22.600 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for coming
 
02:31:25.710 --> 02:31:25.720 align:start position:0%
um7 I'm cons concerned about the term
 
02:31:28.230 --> 02:31:28.240 align:start position:0%
voucher that you're using could you show
 
02:31:30.630 --> 02:31:30.640 align:start position:0%
me in the statutes where it says this is
 
02:31:33.870 --> 02:31:33.880 align:start position:0%
a voucher program I also use
 
02:31:38.269 --> 02:31:38.279 align:start position:0%
EA okay but um follow up yes all the
 
02:31:40.309 --> 02:31:40.319 align:start position:0%
emails I'm getting are stop the voucher
 
02:31:42.110 --> 02:31:42.120 align:start position:0%
program if you look up voucher program
 
02:31:44.150 --> 02:31:44.160 align:start position:0%
it was
 
02:31:47.110 --> 02:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
repealed so I'm I'm concerned that
 
02:31:49.030 --> 02:31:49.040 align:start position:0%
they're working on a definition that
 
02:31:52.790 --> 02:31:52.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist right now and maybe maybe
 
02:31:55.550 --> 02:31:55.560 align:start position:0%
we're working at Cross purposes could be
 
02:31:58.349 --> 02:31:58.359 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions from the
 
02:31:58.359 --> 02:31:59.830 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions from the
representative

02:31:59.830 --> 02:31:59.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:32:02.990 --> 02:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
Tanner thank you um when we do food
 
02:32:05.150 --> 02:32:05.160 align:start position:0%
programs like Snap programs we give
 
02:32:09.389 --> 02:32:09.399 align:start position:0%
vouchers and vouchers um in in
 
02:32:12.230 --> 02:32:12.240 align:start position:0%
definition outside of legislative would
 
02:32:15.230 --> 02:32:15.240 align:start position:0%
you agree means that a certain amount of
 
02:32:16.830 --> 02:32:16.840 align:start position:0%
money is given to
 
02:32:19.790 --> 02:32:19.800 align:start position:0%
people to expend uh and that money is
 
02:32:22.030 --> 02:32:22.040 align:start position:0%
coming from the state thank you for the
 
02:32:23.349 --> 02:32:23.359 align:start position:0%
question yes I
 
02:32:26.269 --> 02:32:26.279 align:start position:0%
would represent cardelli uh thank you
 
02:32:28.269 --> 02:32:28.279 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here uh you
 
02:32:30.990 --> 02:32:31.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned um about uh these programs
 
02:32:33.630 --> 02:32:33.640 align:start position:0%
diverting funds um maybe you could tell
 
02:32:35.830 --> 02:32:35.840 align:start position:0%
us about any public schools in New
 
02:32:37.950 --> 02:32:37.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that have not received the
 
02:32:39.830 --> 02:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
amounts of money that they are entitled
 
02:32:43.190 --> 02:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
to um according to current state
 
02:32:46.309 --> 02:32:46.319 align:start position:0%
law thank you for the question the money
 
02:32:47.870 --> 02:32:47.880 align:start position:0%
that I'm talking about when referring to
 
02:32:49.590 --> 02:32:49.600 align:start position:0%
diverting funds it's money going to
 
02:32:51.469 --> 02:32:51.479 align:start position:0%
students that were not in private I'm
 
02:32:52.670 --> 02:32:52.680 align:start position:0%
sorry we're not in public schools
 
02:32:54.230 --> 02:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
already that were already in private or
 
02:32:56.389 --> 02:32:56.399 align:start position:0%
religious schools that are taking money
 
02:32:58.389 --> 02:32:58.399 align:start position:0%
that could be spent so it wasn't already
 
02:33:00.750 --> 02:33:00.760 align:start position:0%
going to a public school it's going
 
02:33:05.630 --> 02:33:05.640 align:start position:0%
somewhere else follow up but I think
 
02:33:08.150 --> 02:33:08.160 align:start position:0%
isn't the point that all public schools
 
02:33:10.230 --> 02:33:10.240 align:start position:0%
are getting the money that they are
 
02:33:12.750 --> 02:33:12.760 align:start position:0%
entitled to ACC according to current
 
02:33:15.190 --> 02:33:15.200 align:start position:0%
state law thank you for the question
 
02:33:17.110 --> 02:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
they are getting correct in saying that
 
02:33:18.070 --> 02:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
they're they're getting what they're
 
02:33:22.230 --> 02:33:22.240 align:start position:0%
entitled to but it needs to be a lot
 
02:33:25.670 --> 02:33:25.680 align:start position:0%
more thank you uh representative Pell
 
02:33:26.830 --> 02:33:26.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
02:33:30.190 --> 02:33:30.200 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh you mentioned that
 
02:33:33.750 --> 02:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
um reaching higher said that um the
 
02:33:35.990 --> 02:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
education Freedom account program if if
 
02:33:38.910 --> 02:33:38.920 align:start position:0%
this if this bill passed would cost
 
02:33:42.950 --> 02:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
could cost taxpayers 1005 million but
 
02:33:46.190 --> 02:33:46.200 align:start position:0%
currently the cost to educate a student
 
02:33:47.670 --> 02:33:47.680 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire is
 
02:33:47.680 --> 02:33:48.830 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire is
approximately

02:33:48.830 --> 02:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
approximately
 
02:33:52.790 --> 02:33:52.800 align:start position:0%
$20,000 the base adequacy is 4,100 so
 
02:33:55.670 --> 02:33:55.680 align:start position:0%
approximately saving $116,000 per
 
02:33:58.710 --> 02:33:58.720 align:start position:0%
student do you have any estimate of what
 
02:34:01.630 --> 02:34:01.640 align:start position:0%
um the education Freedom accounts might
 
02:34:04.349 --> 02:34:04.359 align:start position:0%
save the state thank you for the
 
02:34:05.750 --> 02:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
question I don't have that on me but I
 
02:34:08.030 --> 02:34:08.040 align:start position:0%
could try to find for
 
02:34:11.230 --> 02:34:11.240 align:start position:0%
you uh thank you any further questions
 
02:34:15.070 --> 02:34:15.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:15.080 --> 02:34:17.950 align:start position:0%
 
much

02:34:17.950 --> 02:34:17.960 align:start position:0%
much
 
02:34:45.070 --> 02:34:45.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:45.080 --> 02:34:55.110 align:start position:0%
 
Trumble

02:34:55.110 --> 02:34:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:56.630 --> 02:34:56.640 align:start position:0%
good morning again thank you committee
 
02:34:58.190 --> 02:34:58.200 align:start position:0%
members I'm David Trumble from the town
 
02:35:00.389 --> 02:35:00.399 align:start position:0%
aware I oppose this bill for a couple
 
02:35:02.429 --> 02:35:02.439 align:start position:0%
reasons I want to start with the conval
 
02:35:04.910 --> 02:35:04.920 align:start position:0%
decision I think this changes the whole
 
02:35:06.710 --> 02:35:06.720 align:start position:0%
decision-making process regarding the
 
02:35:09.309 --> 02:35:09.319 align:start position:0%
EFA program remember the Constitutional
 
02:35:11.790 --> 02:35:11.800 align:start position:0%
Duty applies to Public Schools that's
 
02:35:13.950 --> 02:35:13.960 align:start position:0%
stated in the Constitution it was also
 
02:35:15.590 --> 02:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
specifically stated in the Claremont
 
02:35:17.070 --> 02:35:17.080 align:start position:0%
decision and again in all of the
 
02:35:19.309 --> 02:35:19.319 align:start position:0%
subsequent Supreme Court decisions we're
 
02:35:22.309 --> 02:35:22.319 align:start position:0%
not meeting that obligation we're giving
 
02:35:25.150 --> 02:35:25.160 align:start position:0%
4200 base Aid the judge said we need at
 
02:35:28.190 --> 02:35:28.200 align:start position:0%
least 7500 probably more like
 
02:35:31.030 --> 02:35:31.040 align:start position:0%
$10,000 the Constitutional Duty comes
 
02:35:34.269 --> 02:35:34.279 align:start position:0%
first before we spend any more money on
 
02:35:36.910 --> 02:35:36.920 align:start position:0%
alternative education we have to live up
 
02:35:40.030 --> 02:35:40.040 align:start position:0%
to our constitutional duties first so
 
02:35:42.630 --> 02:35:42.640 align:start position:0%
until you fund that I don't think we can
 
02:35:44.950 --> 02:35:44.960 align:start position:0%
fund any additional money for
 
02:35:47.870 --> 02:35:47.880 align:start position:0%
efas last year we testified and said
 
02:35:49.510 --> 02:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
this and somebody said well but we are
 
02:35:51.469 --> 02:35:51.479 align:start position:0%
living up to our duty so now we can
 
02:35:53.950 --> 02:35:53.960 align:start position:0%
spend extra money on efas the judge
 
02:35:56.110 --> 02:35:56.120 align:start position:0%
finally documented how much we're not
 
02:35:58.110 --> 02:35:58.120 align:start position:0%
living up to our duty so I think until
 
02:36:00.150 --> 02:36:00.160 align:start position:0%
you actually live up to that Duty which
 
02:36:02.750 --> 02:36:02.760 align:start position:0%
would cost us $500 million we don't have
 
02:36:06.349 --> 02:36:06.359 align:start position:0%
$100 million left for efas second we are
 
02:36:09.030 --> 02:36:09.040 align:start position:0%
not obligated to spend a penny on the
 
02:36:11.349 --> 02:36:11.359 align:start position:0%
EFA program there's no constitutional
 
02:36:13.230 --> 02:36:13.240 align:start position:0%
Duty that applies to private schools
 
02:36:14.950 --> 02:36:14.960 align:start position:0%
that's clearly not in our constitution
 
02:36:16.510 --> 02:36:16.520 align:start position:0%
or the Claremont decision
 
02:36:18.750 --> 02:36:18.760 align:start position:0%
the US Supreme Court in the Caren versus
 
02:36:20.990 --> 02:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
Mon case said as we held in espanosa
 
02:36:24.110 --> 02:36:24.120 align:start position:0%
another case similar case a state need
 
02:36:26.469 --> 02:36:26.479 align:start position:0%
not subsidize private education there's
 
02:36:28.670 --> 02:36:28.680 align:start position:0%
no New Hampshire or us constitutional
 
02:36:31.389 --> 02:36:31.399 align:start position:0%
duty to spend public education so what
 
02:36:34.389 --> 02:36:34.399 align:start position:0%
you could do and remember now the 4200
 
02:36:36.670 --> 02:36:36.680 align:start position:0%
that you're giving to each EFA is not
 
02:36:38.750 --> 02:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
constitutionally linked that was a
 
02:36:40.870 --> 02:36:40.880 align:start position:0%
legislative convenience so what you
 
02:36:43.230 --> 02:36:43.240 align:start position:0%
could do is say conille says we have to
 
02:36:46.070 --> 02:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
go up to 7,500 we're going to pass that
 
02:36:47.990 --> 02:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
we're going to live up to that and keep
 
02:36:50.510 --> 02:36:50.520 align:start position:0%
the EFA amount at 4,200 there's no
 
02:36:52.870 --> 02:36:52.880 align:start position:0%
reason they have to remain tied forever
 
02:36:55.990 --> 02:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
and ever into the future Additionally
 
02:36:57.750 --> 02:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
the state has the constitutional right
 
02:37:00.389 --> 02:37:00.399 align:start position:0%
to put other restrictions on EFA funding
 
02:37:02.190 --> 02:37:02.200 align:start position:0%
in that Carson vers Mak case you know
 
02:37:04.830 --> 02:37:04.840 align:start position:0%
that's the case in Maine where the state
 
02:37:06.510 --> 02:37:06.520 align:start position:0%
was funding some private schools and
 
02:37:08.870 --> 02:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
denied money to all religious schools
 
02:37:11.670 --> 02:37:11.680 align:start position:0%
judge Roberts wrote that it's wrong to
 
02:37:13.590 --> 02:37:13.600 align:start position:0%
say as the denters do that under our
 
02:37:15.550 --> 02:37:15.560 align:start position:0%
decision today Maine must fund religious
 
02:37:17.750 --> 02:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
educ ation as we held in espanosa a
 
02:37:19.429 --> 02:37:19.439 align:start position:0%
state need not subsidize private
 
02:37:21.830 --> 02:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
education but once a state decides to do
 
02:37:23.950 --> 02:37:23.960 align:start position:0%
so it cannot disqualify some private
 
02:37:26.309 --> 02:37:26.319 align:start position:0%
schools solely because they're religious
 
02:37:28.710 --> 02:37:28.720 align:start position:0%
emphasis on the word solely the state
 
02:37:30.630 --> 02:37:30.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to provide funds to
 
02:37:32.590 --> 02:37:32.600 align:start position:0%
religious schools or to private schools
 
02:37:34.150 --> 02:37:34.160 align:start position:0%
if you do fund private schools you can't
 
02:37:36.590 --> 02:37:36.600 align:start position:0%
say no to every religious school but you
 
02:37:38.830 --> 02:37:38.840 align:start position:0%
could say no to some religious schools
 
02:37:40.790 --> 02:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
or any private school for specific
 
02:37:42.830 --> 02:37:42.840 align:start position:0%
reasons for instance if they had racist
 
02:37:45.190 --> 02:37:45.200 align:start position:0%
policies you could legitimately as the
 
02:37:48.030 --> 02:37:48.040 align:start position:0%
state of New say we won't fund them
 
02:37:49.910 --> 02:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
there are there was a university in the
 
02:37:52.910 --> 02:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
US that had a ban on interracial dating
 
02:37:54.750 --> 02:37:54.760 align:start position:0%
as recently as the century we're living
 
02:37:57.750 --> 02:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
in if a private school had that policy
 
02:37:59.349 --> 02:37:59.359 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire you would all say we
 
02:38:01.110 --> 02:38:01.120 align:start position:0%
won we don't want our EFA funding to go
 
02:38:02.550 --> 02:38:02.560 align:start position:0%
to that I think we can all agree there
 
02:38:05.030 --> 02:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
are limits we don't have to give EFA
 
02:38:07.110 --> 02:38:07.120 align:start position:0%
funds to every single private school
 
02:38:08.510 --> 02:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
that brings up the question they
 
02:38:09.790 --> 02:38:09.800 align:start position:0%
discriminate against children with
 
02:38:11.550 --> 02:38:11.560 align:start position:0%
disabilities they discriminate against
 
02:38:14.190 --> 02:38:14.200 align:start position:0%
children who are lgbtq why can't the
 
02:38:16.670 --> 02:38:16.680 align:start position:0%
state also say we will give you money
 
02:38:18.910 --> 02:38:18.920 align:start position:0%
but you have to live up to basic civil
 
02:38:20.790 --> 02:38:20.800 align:start position:0%
rights last least the question about
 
02:38:22.750 --> 02:38:22.760 align:start position:0%
saving money there's about 4,000
 
02:38:25.389 --> 02:38:25.399 align:start position:0%
children in the EFA program 75% go to
 
02:38:27.070 --> 02:38:27.080 align:start position:0%
private schools there's only 1,000 who
 
02:38:28.790 --> 02:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
left the public school to go to a
 
02:38:31.030 --> 02:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
private school there's 180 school
 
02:38:32.590 --> 02:38:32.600 align:start position:0%
districts in the state that basically
 
02:38:34.389 --> 02:38:34.399 align:start position:0%
means five or six students in each
 
02:38:36.790 --> 02:38:36.800 align:start position:0%
School District participate who from
 
02:38:38.429 --> 02:38:38.439 align:start position:0%
went from a public school that's one
 
02:38:40.790 --> 02:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
child per School how can that possibly
 
02:38:43.070 --> 02:38:43.080 align:start position:0%
save any money you you have a fourth
 
02:38:45.790 --> 02:38:45.800 align:start position:0%
grade with two classes 25 kids in each
 
02:38:48.030 --> 02:38:48.040 align:start position:0%
room losing one student doesn't save
 
02:38:50.990 --> 02:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
that that school a penny people who
 
02:38:52.990 --> 02:38:53.000 align:start position:0%
assert that it does it's time for them
 
02:38:54.750 --> 02:38:54.760 align:start position:0%
to put up some evidence so that the
 
02:38:56.230 --> 02:38:56.240 align:start position:0%
people of New Hampshire can look at your
 
02:38:58.750 --> 02:38:58.760 align:start position:0%
flowcharts and see where's the savings
 
02:39:01.150 --> 02:39:01.160 align:start position:0%
because right now there is no savings
 
02:39:03.429 --> 02:39:03.439 align:start position:0%
that's all I have thank you thank you
 
02:39:05.590 --> 02:39:05.600 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
02:39:08.349 --> 02:39:08.359 align:start position:0%
for testifier no thank you thank you
 
02:39:14.630 --> 02:39:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:14.640 --> 02:39:22.110 align:start position:0%
 
wilky

02:39:22.110 --> 02:39:22.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:24.030 --> 02:39:24.040 align:start position:0%
good morning um Mr chair and members of
 
02:39:25.510 --> 02:39:25.520 align:start position:0%
the committee thank you for having me
 
02:39:27.150 --> 02:39:27.160 align:start position:0%
I'm Mary Wilkey I live in conquered and
 
02:39:29.110 --> 02:39:29.120 align:start position:0%
I'm a retired school teacher public
 
02:39:32.670 --> 02:39:32.680 align:start position:0%
school teacher um I just I want to
 
02:39:35.469 --> 02:39:35.479 align:start position:0%
reiterate without repeating that I also
 
02:39:37.750 --> 02:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
agree that uh until New Hampshire Liv us
 
02:39:39.670 --> 02:39:39.680 align:start position:0%
its constitutional obligation to fully
 
02:39:41.670 --> 02:39:41.680 align:start position:0%
fund our Public Schools it really has
 
02:39:43.389 --> 02:39:43.399 align:start position:0%
should not be giving away ever
 
02:39:45.750 --> 02:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
increasing amounts of money to private
 
02:39:48.230 --> 02:39:48.240 align:start position:0%
and uh schools and other educational
 
02:39:51.269 --> 02:39:51.279 align:start position:0%
vendors um I assume that the reason the
 
02:39:52.910 --> 02:39:52.920 align:start position:0%
legislature has never complied with
 
02:39:55.269 --> 02:39:55.279 align:start position:0%
Claremont is because it's expensive but
 
02:39:56.990 --> 02:39:57.000 align:start position:0%
if we have the money if we have money
 
02:39:58.870 --> 02:39:58.880 align:start position:0%
lying around to give to private schools
 
02:40:00.349 --> 02:40:00.359 align:start position:0%
then that money should be going to
 
02:40:02.830 --> 02:40:02.840 align:start position:0%
Public Schools according to our New
 
02:40:04.990 --> 02:40:05.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court which is the
 
02:40:07.550 --> 02:40:07.560 align:start position:0%
body that gets to interpret the law I
 
02:40:09.870 --> 02:40:09.880 align:start position:0%
often disagree with Court decisions but
 
02:40:11.590 --> 02:40:11.600 align:start position:0%
they're the ones under our constitution
 
02:40:14.550 --> 02:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
who get to decide
 
02:40:17.150 --> 02:40:17.160 align:start position:0%
um I feel like it's kind of like if a
 
02:40:19.550 --> 02:40:19.560 align:start position:0%
parent was ordered to pay child you know
 
02:40:21.910 --> 02:40:21.920 align:start position:0%
$1,000 in child support every month and
 
02:40:23.910 --> 02:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
they were only paying 200 and then they
 
02:40:25.389 --> 02:40:25.399 align:start position:0%
were also giving money to the kid down
 
02:40:27.510 --> 02:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
the street it's just not it's just not
 
02:40:30.070 --> 02:40:30.080 align:start position:0%
the way it should be uh last Wednesday
 
02:40:31.710 --> 02:40:31.720 align:start position:0%
when the school funding bills were're
 
02:40:33.349 --> 02:40:33.359 align:start position:0%
being heard testimony from a public
 
02:40:35.309 --> 02:40:35.319 align:start position:0%
school principal whose school doesn't
 
02:40:38.710 --> 02:40:38.720 align:start position:0%
have running water here in New Hampshire
 
02:40:40.830 --> 02:40:40.840 align:start position:0%
in the United States of America a public
 
02:40:43.349 --> 02:40:43.359 align:start position:0%
school with now running water we heard
 
02:40:45.550 --> 02:40:45.560 align:start position:0%
from students who couldn't go to college
 
02:40:47.550 --> 02:40:47.560 align:start position:0%
because their school couldn't offer
 
02:40:49.510 --> 02:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
language classes or they couldn't get
 
02:40:52.030 --> 02:40:52.040 align:start position:0%
into certain colleges because of that uh
 
02:40:53.830 --> 02:40:53.840 align:start position:0%
the idea that the legislature might let
 
02:40:56.150 --> 02:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
those conditions continue to exist but
 
02:40:57.950 --> 02:40:57.960 align:start position:0%
be willing to write a check to a
 
02:41:00.389 --> 02:41:00.399 align:start position:0%
millionaire who's paying the 60,000 or
 
02:41:02.750 --> 02:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
whatever tuition at Philips exitor which
 
02:41:07.469 --> 02:41:07.479 align:start position:0%
has a $1.2 billion um uh endowment fund
 
02:41:09.510 --> 02:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
the idea that we would write a check to
 
02:41:12.469 --> 02:41:12.479 align:start position:0%
that person and not fix the problems
 
02:41:14.269 --> 02:41:14.279 align:start position:0%
that exist in public schools because of
 
02:41:16.710 --> 02:41:16.720 align:start position:0%
a uh insufficient funding just strikes
 
02:41:20.510 --> 02:41:20.520 align:start position:0%
me as just outrageously
 
02:41:23.349 --> 02:41:23.359 align:start position:0%
wrong uh the legislative oversight
 
02:41:25.830 --> 02:41:25.840 align:start position:0%
committee has uh created a list of
 
02:41:27.670 --> 02:41:27.680 align:start position:0%
questions they'd like to see answered
 
02:41:29.790 --> 02:41:29.800 align:start position:0%
and and addressed and there hasn't you
 
02:41:31.790 --> 02:41:31.800 align:start position:0%
that just came out November 30th the
 
02:41:34.110 --> 02:41:34.120 align:start position:0%
first report of an oversight committee
 
02:41:35.750 --> 02:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
how could how can we go forward and
 
02:41:39.269 --> 02:41:39.279 align:start position:0%
expand this program without considering
 
02:41:42.269 --> 02:41:42.279 align:start position:0%
what they came up with uh we don't know
 
02:41:44.110 --> 02:41:44.120 align:start position:0%
what's happening to some there quite a
 
02:41:46.950 --> 02:41:46.960 align:start position:0%
few kids I think it's maybe oh sorry I'm
 
02:41:48.790 --> 02:41:48.800 align:start position:0%
not good at remembering numbers but a
 
02:41:51.150 --> 02:41:51.160 align:start position:0%
lot of kids who are referred to as other
 
02:41:53.070 --> 02:41:53.080 align:start position:0%
exits they've left the program not going
 
02:41:55.190 --> 02:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
to public school not
 
02:41:57.309 --> 02:41:57.319 align:start position:0%
graduating where do they go what
 
02:41:59.790 --> 02:41:59.800 align:start position:0%
happened to them we don't even know that
 
02:42:01.630 --> 02:42:01.640 align:start position:0%
uh there's a lot of questions that need
 
02:42:03.710 --> 02:42:03.720 align:start position:0%
to be answered by the Department of
 
02:42:05.790 --> 02:42:05.800 align:start position:0%
Education with all these questions out
 
02:42:07.590 --> 02:42:07.600 align:start position:0%
there why would we expand the program I
 
02:42:10.030 --> 02:42:10.040 align:start position:0%
what's the rush at least find out have
 
02:42:12.070 --> 02:42:12.080 align:start position:0%
the audit consider what the oversight
 
02:42:13.950 --> 02:42:13.960 align:start position:0%
committee came up with and then think
 
02:42:16.750 --> 02:42:16.760 align:start position:0%
about it thank you thank you um
 
02:42:19.790 --> 02:42:19.800 align:start position:0%
questions uh representative beler thank
 
02:42:21.670 --> 02:42:21.680 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you for the testimony
 
02:42:23.870 --> 02:42:23.880 align:start position:0%
have this I know it's written
 
02:42:23.880 --> 02:42:25.630 align:start position:0%
have this I know it's written
away

02:42:25.630 --> 02:42:25.640 align:start position:0%
away
 
02:42:27.990 --> 02:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
um if I understand correctly the
 
02:42:29.110 --> 02:42:29.120 align:start position:0%
significant amount of your argument
 
02:42:32.950 --> 02:42:32.960 align:start position:0%
hinges on the your assertion that you
 
02:42:35.230 --> 02:42:35.240 align:start position:0%
just made that the the
 
02:42:38.309 --> 02:42:38.319 align:start position:0%
court um decisions that we have that
 
02:42:40.630 --> 02:42:40.640 align:start position:0%
we're working on here that within our
 
02:42:42.990 --> 02:42:43.000 align:start position:0%
constitution the court has been given
 
02:42:45.710 --> 02:42:45.720 align:start position:0%
the sole authority to interpret
 
02:42:48.830 --> 02:42:48.840 align:start position:0%
Constitution and law so on that can you
 
02:42:50.309 --> 02:42:50.319 align:start position:0%
can you expound a little bit as to
 
02:42:52.870 --> 02:42:52.880 align:start position:0%
exactly where in our constitution the
 
02:42:54.950 --> 02:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
court is delegated the sole
 
02:42:56.429 --> 02:42:56.439 align:start position:0%
responsibility of interpreting the
 
02:42:59.230 --> 02:42:59.240 align:start position:0%
Constitution and law and how if they are
 
02:43:01.550 --> 02:43:01.560 align:start position:0%
in fact Superior to both other branches
 
02:43:03.429 --> 02:43:03.439 align:start position:0%
of government in that way we could
 
02:43:04.870 --> 02:43:04.880 align:start position:0%
possibly be a
 
02:43:08.870 --> 02:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
republic well I can't I I don't have the
 
02:43:10.230 --> 02:43:10.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire constitution in front of
 
02:43:12.630 --> 02:43:12.640 align:start position:0%
me but my understanding from going to
 
02:43:15.429 --> 02:43:15.439 align:start position:0%
public school and going to college Etc
 
02:43:16.790 --> 02:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
is that uh we have three branches of
 
02:43:18.670 --> 02:43:18.680 align:start position:0%
government that are co-equal and that
 
02:43:21.190 --> 02:43:21.200 align:start position:0%
they each have their own areas and that
 
02:43:23.030 --> 02:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
the legislature makes the laws and the
 
02:43:25.710 --> 02:43:25.720 align:start position:0%
con and the courts interpret the laws
 
02:43:29.110 --> 02:43:29.120 align:start position:0%
and the uh executive department uh uh
 
02:43:32.870 --> 02:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
Branch enforces the laws and so I I
 
02:43:34.790 --> 02:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
imagine I could find it if I had it but
 
02:43:37.110 --> 02:43:37.120 align:start position:0%
I don't have it in my
 
02:43:40.590 --> 02:43:40.600 align:start position:0%
brain any further questions seean thank
 
02:43:42.150 --> 02:43:42.160 align:start position:0%

education oversight EFA oversight
 
02:44:20.469 --> 02:44:20.479 align:start position:0%
committee meetings um there was some
 
02:44:24.469 --> 02:44:24.479 align:start position:0%
information about uh the number of um uh
 
02:44:27.710 --> 02:44:27.720 align:start position:0%
students who have left the program for
 
02:44:30.750 --> 02:44:30.760 align:start position:0%
reasons other than graduation uh do you
 
02:44:33.910 --> 02:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
have any do you have that data handy I I
 
02:44:36.469 --> 02:44:36.479 align:start position:0%
don't yes other exits I was just looking
 
02:44:38.070 --> 02:44:38.080 align:start position:0%
at that as a matter of fact since that's
 
02:44:40.190 --> 02:44:40.200 align:start position:0%
come up we've given that um information
 
02:44:41.750 --> 02:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
to the department we've also given that
 
02:44:44.030 --> 02:44:44.040 align:start position:0%
to the legislative oversight committee I
 
02:44:45.750 --> 02:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
was just looking at that
 
02:44:48.510 --> 02:44:48.520 align:start position:0%
so the reason that that um came up as
 
02:44:51.349 --> 02:44:51.359 align:start position:0%
525 other exits is because that
 
02:44:52.830 --> 02:44:52.840 align:start position:0%
information was from the beginning of
 
02:44:54.630 --> 02:44:54.640 align:start position:0%
the year report that the department had
 
02:44:57.429 --> 02:44:57.439 align:start position:0%
so they didn't have all the information
 
02:45:02.110 --> 02:45:02.120 align:start position:0%
um 164 of those students were delayed in
 
02:45:05.230 --> 02:45:05.240 align:start position:0%
submitting their application 94 of those
 
02:45:07.710 --> 02:45:07.720 align:start position:0%
students were in the process of
 
02:45:10.309 --> 02:45:10.319 align:start position:0%
submitting their
 
02:45:12.950 --> 02:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
application um 11
 
02:45:16.990 --> 02:45:17.000 align:start position:0%
students were delayed in reapplying but
 
02:45:19.269 --> 02:45:19.279 align:start position:0%
they were not exited and and I can send
 
02:45:20.830 --> 02:45:20.840 align:start position:0%
this all to you but right yeah the
 
02:45:22.389 --> 02:45:22.399 align:start position:0%
majority of those students were just in
 
02:45:23.790 --> 02:45:23.800 align:start position:0%
the process of submitting their
 
02:45:27.830 --> 02:45:27.840 align:start position:0%
application or not submitted it at the
 
02:45:30.870 --> 02:45:30.880 align:start position:0%
time um I'll take a followup okay sorry
 
02:45:35.790 --> 02:45:35.800 align:start position:0%
about that that's okay um thank you uh
 
02:45:38.670 --> 02:45:38.680 align:start position:0%
um so what was the the bottom line
 
02:45:42.710 --> 02:45:42.720 align:start position:0%
number in then uh when you subtract
 
02:45:47.670 --> 02:45:47.680 align:start position:0%
those from the original 500 uh plus um I
 
02:45:49.830 --> 02:45:49.840 align:start position:0%
I remember hearing a much smaller
 
02:45:52.550 --> 02:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
number uh so the the number of students
 
02:45:55.389 --> 02:45:55.399 align:start position:0%
that actually left the program was 107
 
02:45:57.710 --> 02:45:57.720 align:start position:0%
out of that
 
02:46:00.510 --> 02:46:00.520 align:start position:0%
525 okay and the total number of
 
02:46:02.429 --> 02:46:02.439 align:start position:0%
students who were in the program at that
 
02:46:03.790 --> 02:46:03.800 align:start position:0%
point was
 
02:46:06.790 --> 02:46:06.800 align:start position:0%
that that was the 4500 number 4500
 
02:46:06.800 --> 02:46:07.750 align:start position:0%
that that was the 4500 number 4500
number

02:46:07.750 --> 02:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
number
 
02:46:10.030 --> 02:46:10.040 align:start position:0%
okay uh represent
 
02:46:12.349 --> 02:46:12.359 align:start position:0%
Tanner thank you can you give us more
 
02:46:15.269 --> 02:46:15.279 align:start position:0%
information about why the audit is isn't
 
02:46:18.670 --> 02:46:18.680 align:start position:0%
being done and why it it started in 22
 
02:46:20.269 --> 02:46:20.279 align:start position:0%
and still isn't being done are we
 
02:46:21.990 --> 02:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
talking about our annual audit that's
 
02:46:24.750 --> 02:46:24.760 align:start position:0%
completed I'm talking about the uh HP
 
02:46:28.389 --> 02:46:28.399 align:start position:0%
1135 the audit that was uh put into law
 
02:46:31.790 --> 02:46:31.800 align:start position:0%
for LBA yes yeah so they are currently
 
02:46:33.750 --> 02:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
in the process of starting that the
 
02:46:36.429 --> 02:46:36.439 align:start position:0%
Department of Education has contacted us
 
02:46:38.750 --> 02:46:38.760 align:start position:0%
and LBA I believe they're in the Pro
 
02:46:40.590 --> 02:46:40.600 align:start position:0%
process of contacting us they've asked
 
02:46:42.710 --> 02:46:42.720 align:start position:0%
us for um the
 
02:46:46.790 --> 02:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
key key um contact information for for
 
02:46:48.349 --> 02:46:48.359 align:start position:0%
the key players at Children's
 
02:46:51.670 --> 02:46:51.680 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund the key individuals and
 
02:46:54.870 --> 02:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
we we have given them that information
 
02:46:58.550 --> 02:46:58.560 align:start position:0%
follow yes so the holdup is with LBA is
 
02:47:00.030 --> 02:47:00.040 align:start position:0%
that what you're saying no I mean I I
 
02:47:02.150 --> 02:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
assume that they're just beginning that
 
02:47:05.790 --> 02:47:05.800 align:start position:0%
process now we were just contracted last
 
02:47:08.429 --> 02:47:08.439 align:start position:0%
week okay but this this audit was
 
02:47:10.990 --> 02:47:11.000 align:start position:0%
supposed to be done in O finished by
 
02:47:13.190 --> 02:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
October of last
 
02:47:17.469 --> 02:47:17.479 align:start position:0%
year I can't speak LBA or the department
 
02:47:19.070 --> 02:47:19.080 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
02:47:23.070 --> 02:47:23.080 align:start position:0%
you um you mentioned another audit you
 
02:47:24.830 --> 02:47:24.840 align:start position:0%
you do an annual audit correct yeah as
 
02:47:27.750 --> 02:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
required by law CSF is supposed to
 
02:47:30.429 --> 02:47:30.439 align:start position:0%
report is supposed to perform an annual
 
02:47:32.190 --> 02:47:32.200 align:start position:0%
audit and that's done and all those
 
02:47:35.990 --> 02:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:38.510 --> 02:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
website further questions representative
 
02:47:40.469 --> 02:47:40.479 align:start position:0%
beler thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:47:44.309 --> 02:47:44.319 align:start position:0%
for your technical support on this um so
 
02:47:47.110 --> 02:47:47.120 align:start position:0%
as the laws written cut off is 350% of
 
02:47:48.950 --> 02:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
federal poverty level for access to this
 
02:47:52.269 --> 02:47:52.279 align:start position:0%
program correct um do we have numbers
 
02:47:55.309 --> 02:47:55.319 align:start position:0%
either in terms of exact numbers or even
 
02:47:57.950 --> 02:47:57.960 align:start position:0%
percentages as to how many New Hampshire
 
02:47:59.990 --> 02:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
children would under current law be
 
02:48:02.230 --> 02:48:02.240 align:start position:0%
refused access to this program based on
 
02:48:05.150 --> 02:48:05.160 align:start position:0%
that number so I pinged the the the
 
02:48:07.469 --> 02:48:07.479 align:start position:0%
application team and we so to date we've
 
02:48:09.750 --> 02:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
only had about 250 students that have
 
02:48:12.910 --> 02:48:12.920 align:start position:0%
applied but that are not eligible for
 
02:48:14.590 --> 02:48:14.600 align:start position:0%
the EFA program because they didn't meet
 
02:48:16.389 --> 02:48:16.399 align:start position:0%
that cut
 
02:48:18.910 --> 02:48:18.920 align:start position:0%
off and just quick follow follow if I
 
02:48:20.870 --> 02:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
may um that's that's very good
 
02:48:22.950 --> 02:48:22.960 align:start position:0%
information do we do we know as far is
 
02:48:24.750 --> 02:48:24.760 align:start position:0%
just demographic Statewide how many
 
02:48:26.309 --> 02:48:26.319 align:start position:0%
students would be yeah sorry I don't
 
02:48:28.670 --> 02:48:28.680 align:start position:0%
have that data okay thank
 
02:48:32.590 --> 02:48:32.600 align:start position:0%
you R tar thank you um do you know how
 
02:48:35.389 --> 02:48:35.399 align:start position:0%
many students that are currently in the
 
02:48:36.670 --> 02:48:36.680 align:start position:0%
program because they don't have to
 
02:48:39.550 --> 02:48:39.560 align:start position:0%
recertify their eligibility have
 
02:48:42.830 --> 02:48:42.840 align:start position:0%
actually gone to 350% or higher yeah I
 
02:48:44.389 --> 02:48:44.399 align:start position:0%
don't have that data but approximately
 
02:48:46.750 --> 02:48:46.760 align:start position:0%
50 % of the students in the program
 
02:48:48.550 --> 02:48:48.560 align:start position:0%
currently have to read certify each year
 
02:48:51.950 --> 02:48:51.960 align:start position:0%
because about 44% of the students uh
 
02:48:53.670 --> 02:48:53.680 align:start position:0%
currently received the free and reduced
 
02:48:55.630 --> 02:48:55.640 align:start position:0%
lunch eligibility requirement and then
 
02:48:58.710 --> 02:48:58.720 align:start position:0%
about 7% are students with um special
 
02:49:01.110 --> 02:49:01.120 align:start position:0%
needs um so then each year those
 
02:49:02.910 --> 02:49:02.920 align:start position:0%
students have to re-qualify so that they
 
02:49:05.110 --> 02:49:05.120 align:start position:0%
can get that disparity Aid and a follow
 
02:49:08.190 --> 02:49:08.200 align:start position:0%
up on that yes and so it you have that
 
02:49:11.230 --> 02:49:11.240 align:start position:0%
information and and if they go
 
02:49:15.469 --> 02:49:15.479 align:start position:0%
beyond uh the current um limit of
 
02:49:17.630 --> 02:49:17.640 align:start position:0%
eligibility they're
 
02:49:19.710 --> 02:49:19.720 align:start position:0%
still correct they would still be
 
02:49:21.190 --> 02:49:21.200 align:start position:0%
eligible for the program because they
 
02:49:22.830 --> 02:49:22.840 align:start position:0%
are grandfathered in according to the
 
02:49:25.790 --> 02:49:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:29.670 --> 02:49:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:33.349 --> 02:49:33.359 align:start position:0%
questions represent Miler well thank you
 
02:49:35.030 --> 02:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
just a clarification so you're saying
 
02:49:35.040 --> 02:49:36.030 align:start position:0%
just a clarification so you're saying
that

02:49:36.030 --> 02:49:36.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:49:38.389 --> 02:49:38.399 align:start position:0%
currently because there's a bill pending
 
02:49:40.950 --> 02:49:40.960 align:start position:0%
before this committee hasn't heard yet
 
02:49:44.190 --> 02:49:44.200 align:start position:0%
you're saying that 45% of those students
 
02:49:47.110 --> 02:49:47.120 align:start position:0%
that are currently in the program have
 
02:49:50.429 --> 02:49:50.439 align:start position:0%
to reapply each year they they actually
 
02:49:53.349 --> 02:49:53.359 align:start position:0%
do yes that so the the the students that
 
02:49:55.550 --> 02:49:55.560 align:start position:0%
qualify for the free and reduced lunch
 
02:49:58.510 --> 02:49:58.520 align:start position:0%
disp dispari a they receive those extra
 
02:50:00.590 --> 02:50:00.600 align:start position:0%
money so they do have to submit their
 
02:50:02.910 --> 02:50:02.920 align:start position:0%
financial their financial documents each
 
02:50:05.229 --> 02:50:05.239 align:start position:0%
year and then our application team has
 
02:50:07.389 --> 02:50:07.399 align:start position:0%
to go over that and and make sure that
 
02:50:09.870 --> 02:50:09.880 align:start position:0%
they meet that eligibility requirement
 
02:50:12.990 --> 02:50:13.000 align:start position:0%
of 350% or less in order to receive
 
02:50:15.590 --> 02:50:15.600 align:start position:0%
those additional Monies
 
02:50:19.429 --> 02:50:19.439 align:start position:0%
so if they do not if they're not
 
02:50:21.550 --> 02:50:21.560 align:start position:0%
eligible for it then they would not
 
02:50:23.590 --> 02:50:23.600 align:start position:0%
receive those additional monies no thank
 
02:50:26.590 --> 02:50:26.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:30.110 --> 02:50:30.120 align:start position:0%
much represent Tanner when you say they
 
02:50:31.910 --> 02:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
don't receive the additional money so
 
02:50:33.349 --> 02:50:33.359 align:start position:0%
they don't receive the additional money
 
02:50:35.870 --> 02:50:35.880 align:start position:0%
for the free and reduced but they still
 
02:50:37.870 --> 02:50:37.880 align:start position:0%
receive the additional money for the EFA
 
02:50:39.670 --> 02:50:39.680 align:start position:0%
or the children's scholarship correct
 
02:50:40.630 --> 02:50:40.640 align:start position:0%
they would be they would be
 
02:50:43.630 --> 02:50:43.640 align:start position:0%
grandfathered into the program right for
 
02:50:45.990 --> 02:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
for just the the EFA State adequacy and
 
02:50:49.349 --> 02:50:49.359 align:start position:0%
the reapplication is merely for the
 
02:50:52.269 --> 02:50:52.279 align:start position:0%
funds for free and reduced or special ed
 
02:50:54.910 --> 02:50:54.920 align:start position:0%
correct okay thank

02:52:39.990 --> 02:52:40.000 align:start position:0%
briefly explain it um it's a program in
 
02:52:44.190 --> 02:52:44.200 align:start position:0%
which we after the um students are have
 
02:52:47.710 --> 02:52:47.720 align:start position:0%
their Algebra 1 class in the spring of
 
02:52:51.670 --> 02:52:51.680 align:start position:0%
of of their 10th grade we work with the
 
02:52:54.429 --> 02:52:54.439 align:start position:0%
parent the student uh folks within the
 
02:52:56.309 --> 02:52:56.319 align:start position:0%
school that are teaching the
 
02:52:59.389 --> 02:52:59.399 align:start position:0%
mathematics and we try to discern if the
 
02:53:01.590 --> 02:53:01.600 align:start position:0%
student is ready to go on to Algebra 2
 
02:53:04.550 --> 02:53:04.560 align:start position:0%
if they really have a good focus on that
 
02:53:06.910 --> 02:53:06.920 align:start position:0%
mathematics um if they
 
02:53:09.510 --> 02:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
don't they they go into what we call a
 
02:53:12.429 --> 02:53:12.439 align:start position:0%
foundation math program which is set up
 
02:53:14.229 --> 02:53:14.239 align:start position:0%
in conjunction with the original grant
 
02:53:15.870 --> 02:53:15.880 align:start position:0%
that we got in Beth Dorian from the
 
02:53:17.670 --> 02:53:17.680 align:start position:0%
community college system worked with
 
02:53:20.550 --> 02:53:20.560 align:start position:0%
that for years and we had 38 or so high
 
02:53:23.030 --> 02:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
schools involved with this program we
 
02:53:25.750 --> 02:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
stopped the grant stopped from which
 
02:53:26.950 --> 02:53:26.960 align:start position:0%
they had received at the community
 
02:53:29.030 --> 02:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
college system that program kind of died
 
02:53:31.710 --> 02:53:31.720 align:start position:0%
until we allocated $200,000 to continue
 
02:53:35.429 --> 02:53:35.439 align:start position:0%
it and and so now we have it we're ready
 
02:53:37.389 --> 02:53:37.399 align:start position:0%
to move forward so following the 10th
 
02:53:39.510 --> 02:53:39.520 align:start position:0%
grade if we have a student that doesn't
 
02:53:42.349 --> 02:53:42.359 align:start position:0%
you know really grasp the and and
 
02:53:44.710 --> 02:53:44.720 align:start position:0%
understand the algebra one and and and
 
02:53:47.309 --> 02:53:47.319 align:start position:0%
and so they go into that foundational
 
02:53:49.229 --> 02:53:49.239 align:start position:0%
math class in 11th grade and then they
 
02:53:50.590 --> 02:53:50.600 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to go into
 
02:53:53.750 --> 02:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
quantitative math in the 12th grade it's
 
02:53:56.630 --> 02:53:56.640 align:start position:0%
a it's a program which is providing
 
02:53:58.830 --> 02:53:58.840 align:start position:0%
instruction differently than you would
 
02:54:01.750 --> 02:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
see in the algebra 2 class however from
 
02:54:05.110 --> 02:54:05.120 align:start position:0%
passing the quantitative math you have
 
02:54:06.750 --> 02:54:06.760 align:start position:0%
sufficiently accomplished what is
 
02:54:08.550 --> 02:54:08.560 align:start position:0%
required for your math requirement when
 
02:54:10.150 --> 02:54:10.160 align:start position:0%
you go into the community college system
 
02:54:12.150 --> 02:54:12.160 align:start position:0%
so you don't have to have that remedial
 
02:54:15.150 --> 02:54:15.160 align:start position:0%
mathematics which we know that we had at
 
02:54:17.429 --> 02:54:17.439 align:start position:0%
1.60% of the students going into the
 
02:54:19.510 --> 02:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
community college system needed remedial
 
02:54:21.750 --> 02:54:21.760 align:start position:0%
math and now they don't do it as
 
02:54:23.630 --> 02:54:23.640 align:start position:0%
remedial math they work with the
 
02:54:25.469 --> 02:54:25.479 align:start position:0%
individual student in the holes that
 
02:54:28.950 --> 02:54:28.960 align:start position:0%
that student has and trying to uh help
 
02:54:31.790 --> 02:54:31.800 align:start position:0%
that that that student with th those
 
02:54:33.910 --> 02:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
subject area or elements within the
 
02:54:36.429 --> 02:54:36.439 align:start position:0%
mathematics to get them on board uh
 
02:54:37.910 --> 02:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
while they're at the community college
 
02:54:40.590 --> 02:54:40.600 align:start position:0%
system and the issue why this is coming
 
02:54:43.750 --> 02:54:43.760 align:start position:0%
forward is that the test which we used
 
02:54:45.990 --> 02:54:46.000 align:start position:0%
at the end of 10th grade and it was
 
02:54:49.870 --> 02:54:49.880 align:start position:0%
called the uh accuplacer um uh what was
 
02:54:49.880 --> 02:54:50.710 align:start position:0%
called the uh accuplacer um uh what was
it

02:54:50.710 --> 02:54:50.720 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:54:54.429 --> 02:54:54.439 align:start position:0%
the the Next Generation accupure uh test
 
02:54:56.630 --> 02:54:56.640 align:start position:0%
examination is no longer used by the
 
02:54:58.550 --> 02:54:58.560 align:start position:0%
community college system and they're
 
02:55:00.870 --> 02:55:00.880 align:start position:0%
using other assessment tools now and
 
02:55:02.110 --> 02:55:02.120 align:start position:0%
that's what we like to do it because
 
02:55:04.269 --> 02:55:04.279 align:start position:0%
there's a number of assessments are also
 
02:55:06.469 --> 02:55:06.479 align:start position:0%
done locally which do the same thing to
 
02:55:08.750 --> 02:55:08.760 align:start position:0%
discern if a child is having child
 
02:55:10.910 --> 02:55:10.920 align:start position:0%
student is having difficulty with
 
02:55:12.590 --> 02:55:12.600 align:start position:0%
algebra 1 and really doesn't understand
 
02:55:15.229 --> 02:55:15.239 align:start position:0%
it and needs that alternative path way
 
02:55:18.550 --> 02:55:18.560 align:start position:0%
if we don't do this the issue is we have
 
02:55:20.550 --> 02:55:20.560 align:start position:0%
students that go on and they learn not
 
02:55:23.830 --> 02:55:23.840 align:start position:0%
to enjoy mathematics and their potential
 
02:55:27.550 --> 02:55:27.560 align:start position:0%
um is lost in the workforce and this is
 
02:55:30.229 --> 02:55:30.239 align:start position:0%
a course that a program which is really
 
02:55:32.229 --> 02:55:32.239 align:start position:0%
finally needed we know that our
 
02:55:33.990 --> 02:55:34.000 align:start position:0%
achievement scores in mathematics in the
 
02:55:36.150 --> 02:55:36.160 align:start position:0%
state are not where we want them even
 
02:55:38.229 --> 02:55:38.239 align:start position:0%
though we're comparing to other states
 
02:55:41.070 --> 02:55:41.080 align:start position:0%
we're doing well but you know that bar
 
02:55:43.269 --> 02:55:43.279 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has pride in saying we we
 
02:55:44.950 --> 02:55:44.960 align:start position:0%
want to be the best
 
02:55:47.510 --> 02:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
and so we want no child to be left
 
02:55:50.469 --> 02:55:50.479 align:start position:0%
behind and and to move forward with this
 
02:55:53.389 --> 02:55:53.399 align:start position:0%
program and I'd be glad to take any any
 
02:55:56.349 --> 02:55:56.359 align:start position:0%
questions any questions representative
 
02:56:00.190 --> 02:56:00.200 align:start position:0%
Tanner thank you um I'm just I'm after
 
02:56:02.990 --> 02:56:03.000 align:start position:0%
doing the dyslexia work I am really
 
02:56:05.590 --> 02:56:05.600 align:start position:0%
concerned with and I I've known students
 
02:56:08.269 --> 02:56:08.279 align:start position:0%
who just they they freak out when they
 
02:56:12.030 --> 02:56:12.040 align:start position:0%
see numbers I mean that's how bad um you
 
02:56:15.670 --> 02:56:15.680 align:start position:0%
know they're uh learning at that
 
02:56:18.630 --> 02:56:18.640 align:start position:0%
learning stage at that point is and um
 
02:56:20.030 --> 02:56:20.040 align:start position:0%
there is a disc
 
02:56:23.950 --> 02:56:23.960 align:start position:0%
calcula um diagnosis where students are
 
02:56:26.590 --> 02:56:26.600 align:start position:0%
very very similar they can't they can't
 
02:56:28.830 --> 02:56:28.840 align:start position:0%
mathematically deal with numbers at at
 
02:56:31.950 --> 02:56:31.960 align:start position:0%
that point they can't code um is there
 
02:56:34.990 --> 02:56:35.000 align:start position:0%
any do you know of any work that's being
 
02:56:37.550 --> 02:56:37.560 align:start position:0%
done be because it have to be done
 
02:56:41.070 --> 02:56:41.080 align:start position:0%
before 10th grade I I would assume um to
 
02:56:44.110 --> 02:56:44.120 align:start position:0%
approach this or to to try to you know
 
02:56:46.630 --> 02:56:46.640 align:start position:0%
know give some help to these students I
 
02:56:48.830 --> 02:56:48.840 align:start position:0%
I know that is an issue that even your
 
02:56:51.630 --> 02:56:51.640 align:start position:0%
your elementary teachers and your
 
02:56:53.550 --> 02:56:53.560 align:start position:0%
principles there and superintendents are
 
02:56:56.429 --> 02:56:56.439 align:start position:0%
cognizant of and in the district I'm in
 
02:56:58.710 --> 02:56:58.720 align:start position:0%
in sau23 Lori malanson who is the
 
02:57:01.389 --> 02:57:01.399 align:start position:0%
superintendent of schools she
 
02:57:04.550 --> 02:57:04.560 align:start position:0%
is UN she's rebaking the whole math
 
02:57:07.469 --> 02:57:07.479 align:start position:0%
program to address this type of issue
 
02:57:09.550 --> 02:57:09.560 align:start position:0%
and so they're they're writing a new
 
02:57:14.190 --> 02:57:14.200 align:start position:0%
curriculum in how they teach and uh I
 
02:57:15.670 --> 02:57:15.680 align:start position:0%
think this is something which is more
 
02:57:18.150 --> 02:57:18.160 align:start position:0%
than just one District I think we're all
 
02:57:20.429 --> 02:57:20.439 align:start position:0%
recognizing after the task force that
 
02:57:22.590 --> 02:57:22.600 align:start position:0%
was set up by Paul leather years ago he
 
02:57:25.150 --> 02:57:25.160 align:start position:0%
was the Deputy Commissioner and that was
 
02:57:28.190 --> 02:57:28.200 align:start position:0%
at least now 14 years or 12 years ago it
 
02:57:30.630 --> 02:57:30.640 align:start position:0%
was recognized that we have two many
 
02:57:32.590 --> 02:57:32.600 align:start position:0%
students which are not doing what they
 
02:57:35.229 --> 02:57:35.239 align:start position:0%
should be doing in mathematics and it
 
02:57:37.510 --> 02:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
was seen that as a result of our
 
02:57:39.269 --> 02:57:39.279 align:start position:0%
achievement test at time at that time
 
02:57:41.389 --> 02:57:41.399 align:start position:0%
showed that after the junior high school
 
02:57:43.550 --> 02:57:43.560 align:start position:0%
level those grades seven and eight there
 
02:57:46.510 --> 02:57:46.520 align:start position:0%
was that huge waterfall effect as far as
 
02:57:49.710 --> 02:57:49.720 align:start position:0%
student uh achievement in in mathematics
 
02:57:51.429 --> 02:57:51.439 align:start position:0%
it goes obviously back into the
 
02:57:53.429 --> 02:57:53.439 align:start position:0%
Elementary grades it's not just laid
 
02:57:55.349 --> 02:57:55.359 align:start position:0%
down on those Junior High teachers or
 
02:57:58.750 --> 02:57:58.760 align:start position:0%
them or the high school teachers and um
 
02:58:00.870 --> 02:58:00.880 align:start position:0%
it it's it's uh something which this
 
02:58:03.469 --> 02:58:03.479 align:start position:0%
program right here has helped do that in
 
02:58:06.550 --> 02:58:06.560 align:start position:0%
fact the the professional training for
 
02:58:09.550 --> 02:58:09.560 align:start position:0%
these teachers that are teaching this
 
02:58:12.510 --> 02:58:12.520 align:start position:0%
this math communities program are
 
02:58:13.990 --> 02:58:14.000 align:start position:0%
teachers that have been taught by
 
02:58:15.670 --> 02:58:15.680 align:start position:0%
teachers that have implemented this
 
02:58:17.070 --> 02:58:17.080 align:start position:0%
program so they bring them in the
 
02:58:19.790 --> 02:58:19.800 align:start position:0%
summertime Community College oversees
 
02:58:21.950 --> 02:58:21.960 align:start position:0%
this and we're trying to get more people
 
02:58:24.830 --> 02:58:24.840 align:start position:0%
trained in this but those people go back
 
02:58:26.510 --> 02:58:26.520 align:start position:0%
into the schools and they're working
 
02:58:28.670 --> 02:58:28.680 align:start position:0%
with the Math teachers and elementary
 
02:58:32.389 --> 02:58:32.399 align:start position:0%
teachers prior that so I think this is a
 
02:58:34.750 --> 02:58:34.760 align:start position:0%
a a good program that we need to
 
02:58:37.229 --> 02:58:37.239 align:start position:0%
continue and we just need to modify to
 
02:58:38.910 --> 02:58:38.920 align:start position:0%
allow this new assessment that they want
 
02:58:42.469 --> 02:58:42.479 align:start position:0%
to use but this is an area that I think
 
02:58:44.910 --> 02:58:44.920 align:start position:0%
that the district district schools the
 
02:58:47.830 --> 02:58:47.840 align:start position:0%
public schools are aware of and trying
 
02:58:50.910 --> 02:58:50.920 align:start position:0%
to address and often times it's like
 
02:58:52.670 --> 02:58:52.680 align:start position:0%
when I met with a group of teachers down
 
02:58:56.110 --> 02:58:56.120 align:start position:0%
in Riven Riven uh Riv
 
02:58:59.269 --> 02:58:59.279 align:start position:0%
rivendale that that's fairly in Corinth
 
02:59:01.429 --> 02:59:01.439 align:start position:0%
Vermont with Orford New Hampshire it's
 
02:59:03.550 --> 02:59:03.560 align:start position:0%
an interstate District I pulled all the
 
02:59:05.190 --> 02:59:05.200 align:start position:0%
math teachers together and I asked the
 
02:59:06.670 --> 02:59:06.680 align:start position:0%
question and back when we were talking
 
02:59:08.950 --> 02:59:08.960 align:start position:0%
about multiplication
 
02:59:12.110 --> 02:59:12.120 align:start position:0%
facts they were diametrically opposed
 
02:59:14.030 --> 02:59:14.040 align:start position:0%
these teachers from each other you know
 
02:59:15.990 --> 02:59:16.000 align:start position:0%
one was saying oh no it's all conceptual
 
02:59:17.630 --> 02:59:17.640 align:start position:0%
you don't have to memorize the other
 
02:59:18.950 --> 02:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
ones in the high school saying you
 
02:59:20.309 --> 02:59:20.319 align:start position:0%
better know those things when you come
 
02:59:22.630 --> 02:59:22.640 align:start position:0%
into these classes and so they weren't
 
02:59:24.630 --> 02:59:24.640 align:start position:0%
talking with each other and I think
 
02:59:26.910 --> 02:59:26.920 align:start position:0%
that's what we have to you start if
 
02:59:28.830 --> 02:59:28.840 align:start position:0%
curriculum is a responsibility The Local
 
02:59:30.870 --> 02:59:30.880 align:start position:0%
District and instruction you got to talk
 
02:59:34.710 --> 02:59:34.720 align:start position:0%
with each other and they got the hint uh
 
02:59:36.830 --> 02:59:36.840 align:start position:0%
that yes the math teacher who is the
 
02:59:38.670 --> 02:59:38.680 align:start position:0%
math teacher at the high school is also
 
02:59:41.349 --> 02:59:41.359 align:start position:0%
working with all those that just like a
 
02:59:44.190 --> 02:59:44.200 align:start position:0%
coach the coach uh for athletic in the
 
02:59:45.670 --> 02:59:45.680 align:start position:0%
high school the varsity coach often
 
02:59:47.950 --> 02:59:47.960 align:start position:0%
times oversees the JV coach and
 
02:59:49.950 --> 02:59:49.960 align:start position:0%
everything else going on in the Middle
 
02:59:52.070 --> 02:59:52.080 align:start position:0%
School level if you want to have a
 
02:59:54.710 --> 02:59:54.720 align:start position:0%
decent program so to have a decent
 
02:59:56.389 --> 02:59:56.399 align:start position:0%
program math we got to do the same thing
 
02:59:57.830 --> 02:59:57.840 align:start position:0%
I think that's happening representa
 
02:59:59.710 --> 02:59:59.720 align:start position:0%
Tanner I think that's an ongoing process
 
03:00:02.389 --> 03:00:02.399 align:start position:0%
and people learn differently and I know
 
03:00:04.630 --> 03:00:04.640 align:start position:0%
I myself was one of those I can remember
 
03:00:07.190 --> 03:00:07.200 align:start position:0%
my f only grade I remember in elementary
 
03:00:09.870 --> 03:00:09.880 align:start position:0%
school what's my first grade teacher
 
03:00:11.710 --> 03:00:11.720 align:start position:0%
called me up the board I was shy didn't
 
03:00:13.469 --> 03:00:13.479 align:start position:0%
want to read didn't know to spell I
 
03:00:16.429 --> 03:00:16.439 align:start position:0%
threw up right in front of her and and
 
03:00:20.910 --> 03:00:20.920 align:start position:0%
and uh so it's uh you know there's
 
03:00:22.389 --> 03:00:22.399 align:start position:0%
teaching styles and there's learning
 
03:00:24.710 --> 03:00:24.720 align:start position:0%
styles and this program matches teaching
 
03:00:26.790 --> 03:00:26.800 align:start position:0%
style and learning style that's an
 
03:00:28.150 --> 03:00:28.160 align:start position:0%
important part of
 
03:00:30.510 --> 03:00:30.520 align:start position:0%
Education further questions yes
 
03:00:32.309 --> 03:00:32.319 align:start position:0%
representative Cornell Thank you thank
 
03:00:34.269 --> 03:00:34.279 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um the math
 
03:00:36.790 --> 03:00:36.800 align:start position:0%
assessment is that is it a universal
 
03:00:38.190 --> 03:00:38.200 align:start position:0%
assessment that will be used in every
 
03:00:40.030 --> 03:00:40.040 align:start position:0%
school or districts are going to be able
 
03:00:41.950 --> 03:00:41.960 align:start position:0%
to use their own to determine if the
 
03:00:44.510 --> 03:00:44.520 align:start position:0%
student needs it's done in coopera with
 
03:00:46.110 --> 03:00:46.120 align:start position:0%
the community college system in New
 
03:00:47.870 --> 03:00:47.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you they're the
 
03:00:49.830 --> 03:00:49.840 align:start position:0%
coordinators of this program okay thank
 
03:00:51.830 --> 03:00:51.840 align:start position:0%
you very much Shannon Reed from the
 
03:00:54.750 --> 03:00:54.760 align:start position:0%
community college system is here also so
 
03:00:56.030 --> 03:00:56.040 align:start position:0%
any further questions representative
 
03:00:58.469 --> 03:00:58.479 align:start position:0%
Belcher thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:01:01.150 --> 03:01:01.160 align:start position:0%
for the bill uh agree with the general
 
03:01:03.070 --> 03:01:03.080 align:start position:0%
concept I have one question on I'm not
 
03:01:05.630 --> 03:01:05.640 align:start position:0%
sure about on on language so it
 
03:01:07.150 --> 03:01:07.160 align:start position:0%
specifically identifies two groups of
 
03:01:09.469 --> 03:01:09.479 align:start position:0%
students those students who are not yet
 
03:01:12.469 --> 03:01:12.479 align:start position:0%
demonstrating uh competency and also
 
03:01:15.389 --> 03:01:15.399 align:start position:0%
those who have demonstrated Mass y but
 
03:01:16.910 --> 03:01:16.920 align:start position:0%
is there such a thing as a student who
 
03:01:19.110 --> 03:01:19.120 align:start position:0%
has demonstrated competency but not yet
 
03:01:20.870 --> 03:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
Mastery and would that student be
 
03:01:23.110 --> 03:01:23.120 align:start position:0%
excluded from higher level math I think
 
03:01:24.750 --> 03:01:24.760 align:start position:0%
this gets to what represent Tanner was
 
03:01:26.389 --> 03:01:26.399 align:start position:0%
speaking to also that there's different
 
03:01:29.710 --> 03:01:29.720 align:start position:0%
learning styles and you you can have
 
03:01:31.990 --> 03:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
students which
 
03:01:35.590 --> 03:01:35.600 align:start position:0%
um Can conceptualize or or something
 
03:01:36.590 --> 03:01:36.600 align:start position:0%
that can
 
03:01:40.150 --> 03:01:40.160 align:start position:0%
memorize and and you really don't know
 
03:01:44.070 --> 03:01:44.080 align:start position:0%
how to apply and in order to to learn
 
03:01:46.070 --> 03:01:46.080 align:start position:0%
how to apply it's just like in CTE
 
03:01:48.110 --> 03:01:48.120 align:start position:0%
programs you learn by doing you learn
 
03:01:49.870 --> 03:01:49.880 align:start position:0%
how to make that cabinet you learn how
 
03:01:53.550 --> 03:01:53.560 align:start position:0%
to you know fix that automobile um but
 
03:01:55.590 --> 03:01:55.600 align:start position:0%
through doing it and that's what this
 
03:01:58.710 --> 03:01:58.720 align:start position:0%
program does it works with the student
 
03:02:02.309 --> 03:02:02.319 align:start position:0%
so we have students in there this is not
 
03:02:05.590 --> 03:02:05.600 align:start position:0%
um a a program that's set up for those
 
03:02:08.190 --> 03:02:08.200 align:start position:0%
which you have difficult time you know
 
03:02:09.950 --> 03:02:09.960 align:start position:0%
in all subject area this is where
 
03:02:12.590 --> 03:02:12.600 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of students come out of
 
03:02:14.229 --> 03:02:14.239 align:start position:0%
elementary school and you ask them
 
03:02:15.590 --> 03:02:15.600 align:start position:0%
what's your favorite course and they'll
 
03:02:18.550 --> 03:02:18.560 align:start position:0%
say yeah recess and then they may say
 
03:02:20.870 --> 03:02:20.880 align:start position:0%
physical education or something such as
 
03:02:23.309 --> 03:02:23.319 align:start position:0%
that but there's not a whole lot of
 
03:02:25.349 --> 03:02:25.359 align:start position:0%
people come through students come
 
03:02:26.870 --> 03:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
through saying mathematics is my
 
03:02:30.070 --> 03:02:30.080 align:start position:0%
favorite subject and um it's pretty
 
03:02:32.590 --> 03:02:32.600 align:start position:0%
common and so somewhere along the way
 
03:02:35.630 --> 03:02:35.640 align:start position:0%
they're getting turned off to it and and
 
03:02:37.670 --> 03:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
uh everything we do is
 
03:02:41.670 --> 03:02:41.680 align:start position:0%
mathematical so um I hope that answers a
 
03:02:44.630 --> 03:02:44.640 align:start position:0%
little bit what you're after thanks yeah
 
03:02:46.389 --> 03:02:46.399 align:start position:0%
see no further questions thank you very
 
03:02:57.110 --> 03:02:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:59.830 --> 03:02:59.840 align:start position:0%
Reed good afternoon education committee
 
03:03:01.229 --> 03:03:01.239 align:start position:0%
my name is Shannon Reed I'm here on
 
03:03:02.750 --> 03:03:02.760 align:start position:0%
behalf of the community college system
 
03:03:05.030 --> 03:03:05.040 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire um the prime sponsor
 
03:03:06.950 --> 03:03:06.960 align:start position:0%
did most of my work for me this morning
 
03:03:09.349 --> 03:03:09.359 align:start position:0%
by explaining the history of the program
 
03:03:11.510 --> 03:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
um the the kind of Genesis of it and
 
03:03:13.870 --> 03:03:13.880 align:start position:0%
what we seek with this bill I'll just
 
03:03:15.630 --> 03:03:15.640 align:start position:0%
say a couple things um first I'm sorry
 
03:03:17.070 --> 03:03:17.080 align:start position:0%
that it's me here today and not my
 
03:03:19.630 --> 03:03:19.640 align:start position:0%
colleague Beth Doran who had been at
 
03:03:21.309 --> 03:03:21.319 align:start position:0%
running this program overseeing the
 
03:03:22.630 --> 03:03:22.640 align:start position:0%
program and she knows so much more about
 
03:03:24.550 --> 03:03:24.560 align:start position:0%
the details than I do so I'll do my best
 
03:03:26.110 --> 03:03:26.120 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions that you might
 
03:03:27.990 --> 03:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
have um we're very excited to be
 
03:03:30.110 --> 03:03:30.120 align:start position:0%
restarting this program it was initially
 
03:03:32.870 --> 03:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
funded through a grant a Federal grant
 
03:03:35.590 --> 03:03:35.600 align:start position:0%
that lasted for maybe four or five years
 
03:03:38.309 --> 03:03:38.319 align:start position:0%
um but it was focused on Innovation that
 
03:03:40.510 --> 03:03:40.520 align:start position:0%
Grant so once this program became kind
 
03:03:42.750 --> 03:03:42.760 align:start position:0%
of entrenched even though it was proven
 
03:03:43.990 --> 03:03:44.000 align:start position:0%
to be successful
 
03:03:46.389 --> 03:03:46.399 align:start position:0%
through metrics and student outcomes in
 
03:03:49.030 --> 03:03:49.040 align:start position:0%
that it was no longer um an innovation
 
03:03:51.229 --> 03:03:51.239 align:start position:0%
the grant funding dried up and so we're
 
03:03:53.910 --> 03:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
we're very grateful that in hital 2 this
 
03:03:55.349 --> 03:03:55.359 align:start position:0%
program was funded so that we could
 
03:03:58.309 --> 03:03:58.319 align:start position:0%
restart it it's um it's got a number of
 
03:04:00.269 --> 03:04:00.279 align:start position:0%
of important benefits one was alluded to
 
03:04:02.469 --> 03:04:02.479 align:start position:0%
in the a previous conversation which is
 
03:04:04.229 --> 03:04:04.239 align:start position:0%
the communication and collaboration it
 
03:04:07.150 --> 03:04:07.160 align:start position:0%
creates between um the secondary level
 
03:04:09.150 --> 03:04:09.160 align:start position:0%
mathematics instructors and Community
 
03:04:11.110 --> 03:04:11.120 align:start position:0%
College mathematics instructors kind of
 
03:04:12.910 --> 03:04:12.920 align:start position:0%
helping each other see what are what are
 
03:04:14.750 --> 03:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
you what are you teaching how are you
 
03:04:16.429 --> 03:04:16.439 align:start position:0%
teaching it at the college level what
 
03:04:18.830 --> 03:04:18.840 align:start position:0%
are we seeing in the math preparedness
 
03:04:20.349 --> 03:04:20.359 align:start position:0%
of students who come directly from high
 
03:04:22.510 --> 03:04:22.520 align:start position:0%
schools to our colleges and so I think
 
03:04:25.110 --> 03:04:25.120 align:start position:0%
that's a huge benefit um also of course
 
03:04:27.429 --> 03:04:27.439 align:start position:0%
the creation of the two math classes
 
03:04:30.469 --> 03:04:30.479 align:start position:0%
that students can take that um that
 
03:04:33.030 --> 03:04:33.040 align:start position:0%
address that address the competencies
 
03:04:35.229 --> 03:04:35.239 align:start position:0%
that students need to place into college
 
03:04:37.510 --> 03:04:37.520 align:start position:0%
level math and then the more advanced
 
03:04:39.190 --> 03:04:39.200 align:start position:0%
course can actually be taken as a dual
 
03:04:41.309 --> 03:04:41.319 align:start position:0%
credit course so students can get credit
 
03:04:43.030 --> 03:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
for that first gateway Math course in
 
03:04:45.469 --> 03:04:45.479 align:start position:0%
college so there's a lot of benefits the
 
03:04:47.750 --> 03:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
results of the program when it was
 
03:04:49.670 --> 03:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
funded and in place were were very
 
03:04:51.469 --> 03:04:51.479 align:start position:0%
positive I'm afraid I don't have those
 
03:04:56.110 --> 03:04:56.120 align:start position:0%
details but um um the the performance
 
03:04:57.830 --> 03:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
the persistence the completion rates of
 
03:05:00.670 --> 03:05:00.680 align:start position:0%
students who took these courses was was
 
03:05:02.349 --> 03:05:02.359 align:start position:0%
very much approved over what had been
 
03:05:05.030 --> 03:05:05.040 align:start position:0%
what had been the case before um so in
 
03:05:08.630 --> 03:05:08.640 align:start position:0%
this bill um we're we're seeking to
 
03:05:10.429 --> 03:05:10.439 align:start position:0%
basically have the statutory language
 
03:05:12.630 --> 03:05:12.640 align:start position:0%
reflect the practice which is evolved
 
03:05:15.349 --> 03:05:15.359 align:start position:0%
Beyond simp using one test the
 
03:05:18.590 --> 03:05:18.600 align:start position:0%
accuplacer test and one cut score as the
 
03:05:21.309 --> 03:05:21.319 align:start position:0%
determining factor in in how students
 
03:05:22.750 --> 03:05:22.760 align:start position:0%
Place into math and this gets a little
 
03:05:24.030 --> 03:05:24.040 align:start position:0%
bit to your question of Competency
 
03:05:26.229 --> 03:05:26.239 align:start position:0%
versus Mastery using multiple measures
 
03:05:28.630 --> 03:05:28.640 align:start position:0%
is really a better practice it's evolved
 
03:05:30.870 --> 03:05:30.880 align:start position:0%
to be a better practice than using one
 
03:05:33.389 --> 03:05:33.399 align:start position:0%
maybe kind of high stakes test that
 
03:05:34.950 --> 03:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
student may or may not do particularly
 
03:05:37.429 --> 03:05:37.439 align:start position:0%
well on in on a given day so using
 
03:05:39.150 --> 03:05:39.160 align:start position:0%
multiple measures to assess student
 
03:05:42.750 --> 03:05:42.760 align:start position:0%
Readiness for the the courses um is is
 
03:05:44.830 --> 03:05:44.840 align:start position:0%
the better prac practice than using one
 
03:05:48.750 --> 03:05:48.760 align:start position:0%
one test um also we're broadening the
 
03:05:51.349 --> 03:05:51.359 align:start position:0%
language for that second higher level
 
03:05:53.429 --> 03:05:53.439 align:start position:0%
course from Simply quantitative
 
03:05:55.469 --> 03:05:55.479 align:start position:0%
reasoning to something that might
 
03:05:58.190 --> 03:05:58.200 align:start position:0%
Encompass or might include um other
 
03:06:00.830 --> 03:06:00.840 align:start position:0%
additional kind of focus areas and we
 
03:06:03.309 --> 03:06:03.319 align:start position:0%
we've in restarting the program we've
 
03:06:05.190 --> 03:06:05.200 align:start position:0%
created a a math learning communities
 
03:06:07.630 --> 03:06:07.640 align:start position:0%
Advisory Group made up of high school
 
03:06:09.710 --> 03:06:09.720 align:start position:0%
instructors College instructors the math
 
03:06:10.750 --> 03:06:10.760 align:start position:0%
consultant for the Department of
 
03:06:12.870 --> 03:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
Education and this this group is going
 
03:06:16.429 --> 03:06:16.439 align:start position:0%
to in broadening their work um determine
 
03:06:18.990 --> 03:06:19.000 align:start position:0%
what the what the best curricular
 
03:06:20.950 --> 03:06:20.960 align:start position:0%
components of that second level course
 
03:06:23.389 --> 03:06:23.399 align:start position:0%
are um so I I can probably stop there
 
03:06:24.550 --> 03:06:24.560 align:start position:0%
and see if you have any specific
 
03:06:27.309 --> 03:06:27.319 align:start position:0%
questions um I I would say actually a
 
03:06:31.269 --> 03:06:31.279 align:start position:0%
couple a couple things in conclusion
 
03:06:34.030 --> 03:06:34.040 align:start position:0%
um a number of years back there was a
 
03:06:38.750 --> 03:06:38.760 align:start position:0%
lot of concern over the lack of kind of
 
03:06:40.670 --> 03:06:40.680 align:start position:0%
consistent and strong math preparedness
 
03:06:42.269 --> 03:06:42.279 align:start position:0%
math Readiness of high school graduates
 
03:06:44.830 --> 03:06:44.840 align:start position:0%
who were coming to to to particularly
 
03:06:46.190 --> 03:06:46.200 align:start position:0%
our colleges but really any any
 
03:06:48.950 --> 03:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
postsecondary education
 
03:06:51.830 --> 03:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
um the community college system did two
 
03:06:54.630 --> 03:06:54.640 align:start position:0%
main things to respond to to that kind
 
03:06:57.590 --> 03:06:57.600 align:start position:0%
of situation one is we created this this
 
03:06:58.950 --> 03:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
program math learning communities the
 
03:07:01.150 --> 03:07:01.160 align:start position:0%
partnership with high schools and two we
 
03:07:03.110 --> 03:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
we changed How We Do developmental math
 
03:07:05.830 --> 03:07:05.840 align:start position:0%
education once students get to College
 
03:07:08.590 --> 03:07:08.600 align:start position:0%
back 20 years ago if a student didn't
 
03:07:11.110 --> 03:07:11.120 align:start position:0%
Place into college level math we would
 
03:07:12.630 --> 03:07:12.640 align:start position:0%
put them in what was then called
 
03:07:15.630 --> 03:07:15.640 align:start position:0%
remedial math or medial Math course um
 
03:07:18.070 --> 03:07:18.080 align:start position:0%
not college credit bearing basically
 
03:07:21.190 --> 03:07:21.200 align:start position:0%
repeating topics that they um had in
 
03:07:23.469 --> 03:07:23.479 align:start position:0%
theory covered in high school it took
 
03:07:26.030 --> 03:07:26.040 align:start position:0%
their time it took their money and um
 
03:07:29.269 --> 03:07:29.279 align:start position:0%
the outcomes metrics were were not not
 
03:07:30.990 --> 03:07:31.000 align:start position:0%
favorable for students who had to be in
 
03:07:32.950 --> 03:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
remedial math if you had you know for
 
03:07:34.790 --> 03:07:34.800 align:start position:0%
any 10 students who got placed into
 
03:07:37.070 --> 03:07:37.080 align:start position:0%
remedial math the number who persisted
 
03:07:38.990 --> 03:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
and completed a a credential a degree or
 
03:07:42.710 --> 03:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
certificate was very small um nationally
 
03:07:44.750 --> 03:07:44.760 align:start position:0%
there they're revolved a better practice
 
03:07:46.429 --> 03:07:46.439 align:start position:0%
and that's called co-requisite
 
03:07:48.790 --> 03:07:48.800 align:start position:0%
remediation and that is identifying
 
03:07:50.950 --> 03:07:50.960 align:start position:0%
specifically what challenges students
 
03:07:53.070 --> 03:07:53.080 align:start position:0%
had in math putting those students into
 
03:07:54.550 --> 03:07:54.560 align:start position:0%
college level math but giving them extra
 
03:07:57.030 --> 03:07:57.040 align:start position:0%
supports in those areas um so the
 
03:07:58.870 --> 03:07:58.880 align:start position:0%
students are they're in college math
 
03:07:59.790 --> 03:07:59.800 align:start position:0%
they're feeling that sense of
 
03:08:00.950 --> 03:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
achievement they're getting support
 
03:08:03.950 --> 03:08:03.960 align:start position:0%
where they need it and that that barrier
 
03:08:05.750 --> 03:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
remedial math became a barrier where it
 
03:08:07.269 --> 03:08:07.279 align:start position:0%
was supposed to be a bridge but we
 
03:08:09.790 --> 03:08:09.800 align:start position:0%
created what was a true bridge to
 
03:08:14.349 --> 03:08:14.359 align:start position:0%
success in a college curriculum um so so
 
03:08:15.630 --> 03:08:15.640 align:start position:0%
that's this bill is basically just
 
03:08:17.309 --> 03:08:17.319 align:start position:0%
updating the language of the statute to
 
03:08:20.229 --> 03:08:20.239 align:start position:0%
kind of reflect current practice I would
 
03:08:22.630 --> 03:08:22.640 align:start position:0%
suggest you might consider one very
 
03:08:23.990 --> 03:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
minor Amendment which is simply to make
 
03:08:25.630 --> 03:08:25.640 align:start position:0%
this bill effective upon passage there's
 
03:08:29.190 --> 03:08:29.200 align:start position:0%
no need for a 60-day um kind of adoption
 
03:08:31.269 --> 03:08:31.279 align:start position:0%
time period so um that's not highly
 
03:08:33.150 --> 03:08:33.160 align:start position:0%
consequential but if it's easy enough to
 
03:08:35.150 --> 03:08:35.160 align:start position:0%
do we would um that would certainly work
 
03:08:36.910 --> 03:08:36.920 align:start position:0%
well for us thank you and I'm happy to
 
03:08:38.550 --> 03:08:38.560 align:start position:0%
try to answer any questions any
 
03:08:40.830 --> 03:08:40.840 align:start position:0%
questions representative cascaden thank
 
03:08:43.030 --> 03:08:43.040 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for your
 
03:08:44.910 --> 03:08:44.920 align:start position:0%
presentation I believe in the in the
 
03:08:48.190 --> 03:08:48.200 align:start position:0%
system and in the process um my question
 
03:08:50.110 --> 03:08:50.120 align:start position:0%
is is there a cost to the local school
 
03:08:52.269 --> 03:08:52.279 align:start position:0%
district to be a
 
03:08:55.309 --> 03:08:55.319 align:start position:0%
partner um I think the the short answer
 
03:08:57.469 --> 03:08:57.479 align:start position:0%
is no but there's there are probably
 
03:08:59.150 --> 03:08:59.160 align:start position:0%
some I guess I would call them in kind
 
03:09:01.389 --> 03:09:01.399 align:start position:0%
costs so the the
 
03:09:03.550 --> 03:09:03.560 align:start position:0%
funding the funding in houseal 2 for
 
03:09:05.950 --> 03:09:05.960 align:start position:0%
this program is $200,000 a year what
 
03:09:09.030 --> 03:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
that pays for are course materials
 
03:09:11.070 --> 03:09:11.080 align:start position:0%
testing materials when we use those like
 
03:09:13.590 --> 03:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
like when we did use the accuplacer
 
03:09:16.910 --> 03:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
um the paying a part-time coordinator
 
03:09:20.469 --> 03:09:20.479 align:start position:0%
that we employ and bringing together in
 
03:09:22.830 --> 03:09:22.840 align:start position:0%
an annual convening all of these folks
 
03:09:24.349 --> 03:09:24.359 align:start position:0%
all these instructors from the various
 
03:09:25.630 --> 03:09:25.640 align:start position:0%
schools and the various levels to kind
 
03:09:28.269 --> 03:09:28.279 align:start position:0%
of facilitate that cross-pollination um
 
03:09:31.070 --> 03:09:31.080 align:start position:0%
so we cover the cost of that but you
 
03:09:33.550 --> 03:09:33.560 align:start position:0%
know the schools may may be incurring
 
03:09:36.070 --> 03:09:36.080 align:start position:0%
some type of cost for participation of
 
03:09:37.670 --> 03:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
their folks I'm not certain about that
 
03:09:39.950 --> 03:09:39.960 align:start position:0%
but I will ask my colleague Beth and I
 
03:09:41.910 --> 03:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
can get back to
 
03:09:41.920 --> 03:09:44.790 align:start position:0%
can get back to
you

03:09:44.790 --> 03:09:44.800 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:09:47.269 --> 03:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
rent beler thank you Mr chair and thank
 
03:09:49.590 --> 03:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
you for being here for this um I believe
 
03:09:51.990 --> 03:09:52.000 align:start position:0%
I heard you that you want to ultimately
 
03:09:54.269 --> 03:09:54.279 align:start position:0%
transition away from the current one
 
03:09:58.469 --> 03:09:58.479 align:start position:0%
high stakes test to a more um a system
 
03:09:59.550 --> 03:09:59.560 align:start position:0%
where you could have multiple
 
03:10:02.070 --> 03:10:02.080 align:start position:0%
assessments being done but the specific
 
03:10:03.870 --> 03:10:03.880 align:start position:0%
language I'm seeing in this bill only
 
03:10:06.590 --> 03:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
makes provision for a mathematics
 
03:10:09.429 --> 03:10:09.439 align:start position:0%
assessment not multiple so is that
 
03:10:11.790 --> 03:10:11.800 align:start position:0%
something you would like to see changed
 
03:10:13.510 --> 03:10:13.520 align:start position:0%
slightly to allow for for multiple
 
03:10:16.710 --> 03:10:16.720 align:start position:0%
assessments instead of just the one
 
03:10:16.720 --> 03:10:19.510 align:start position:0%
assessments instead of just the one
um

03:10:19.510 --> 03:10:19.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:10:23.030 --> 03:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
yeah I I I guess I think either way I
 
03:10:25.150 --> 03:10:25.160 align:start position:0%
think we could interpret a mathematics
 
03:10:28.670 --> 03:10:28.680 align:start position:0%
assessment to be inclusive of multiple
 
03:10:31.429 --> 03:10:31.439 align:start position:0%
measures okay
 
03:10:33.429 --> 03:10:33.439 align:start position:0%
fair further
 
03:10:35.630 --> 03:10:35.640 align:start position:0%
questions see none thank you very much
 
03:10:39.229 --> 03:10:39.239 align:start position:0%
for being here and um that will close uh
 
03:10:41.830 --> 03:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
the hearing on House Bill
 
03:10:41.840 --> 03:10:44.469 align:start position:0%
the hearing on House Bill
1167

03:10:44.469 --> 03:10:44.479 align:start position:0%
1167
 
03:10:44.479 --> 03:10:46.110 align:start position:0%
1167
and

03:10:46.110 --> 03:10:46.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:10:48.750 --> 03:10:48.760 align:start position:0%
um break for lunch what's the time we
 
03:10:50.710 --> 03:10:50.720 align:start position:0%
supposed to be back one you want to make
 
03:10:54.030 --> 03:10:54.040 align:start position:0%
it 1:15 I think
 
03:10:54.040 --> 03:11:00.229 align:start position:0%
it 1:15 I think
1:00

03:11:00.229 --> 03:11:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:11.590 --> 03:11:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:25.030 --> 03:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:27.670 --> 03:11:27.680 align:start position:0%
well see you
 
03:11:30.229 --> 03:11:30.239 align:start position:0%
tomorrow that's your partner
 
03:11:41.750 --> 03:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:41.760 --> 03:12:11.670 align:start position:0%
 
much

03:12:11.670 --> 03:12:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:11.680 --> 03:41:09.030 align:start position:0%
 
good

03:41:09.030 --> 03:41:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:09.040 --> 04:04:07.149 align:start position:0%
 
e

04:04:07.149 --> 04:04:07.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:18.389 --> 04:04:18.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:18.399 --> 04:04:23.269 align:start position:0%
 
jr7

04:04:23.269 --> 04:04:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:27.110 --> 04:04:27.120 align:start position:0%
Bas the thank you chairman members of
 
04:04:29.710 --> 04:04:29.720 align:start position:0%
Education House Education I'm here to
 
04:04:33.149 --> 04:04:33.159 align:start position:0%
testify in favor of HB
 
04:04:35.990 --> 04:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
1677 also known as the every student
 
04:04:37.429 --> 04:04:37.439 align:start position:0%
loves education achievement and
 
04:04:39.630 --> 04:04:39.640 align:start position:0%
reforming neglectful schools act the
 
04:04:41.229 --> 04:04:41.239 align:start position:0%
every student learns
 
04:04:43.469 --> 04:04:43.479 align:start position:0%
act I think everybody in this room is
 
04:04:45.389 --> 04:04:45.399 align:start position:0%
interested in making sure the children
 
04:04:47.030 --> 04:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
educated in the state of New Hampshire
 
04:04:48.910 --> 04:04:48.920 align:start position:0%
have the best possible
 
04:04:51.550 --> 04:04:51.560 align:start position:0%
education that's the goal one would hope
 
04:04:53.429 --> 04:04:53.439 align:start position:0%
that this committee is fully engaged in
 
04:04:55.590 --> 04:04:55.600 align:start position:0%
supportive of that
 
04:04:59.189 --> 04:04:59.199 align:start position:0%
goal the bill is a is a redo to the
 
04:05:00.790 --> 04:05:00.800 align:start position:0%
definitions that are currently under
 
04:05:04.349 --> 04:05:04.359 align:start position:0%
chapter 194 DF
 
04:05:06.990 --> 04:05:07.000 align:start position:0%
d-f as in Frank education Freedom
 
04:05:09.670 --> 04:05:09.680 align:start position:0%
accounts and current definition is under
 
04:05:12.550 --> 04:05:12.560 align:start position:0%
Section Roman numeral 6 it's eligible
 
04:05:15.630 --> 04:05:15.640 align:start position:0%
student this bill repeals and reenacts
 
04:05:18.710 --> 04:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
that section um following the same
 
04:05:20.710 --> 04:05:20.720 align:start position:0%
policies that are currently in six with
 
04:05:22.590 --> 04:05:22.600 align:start position:0%
one major exception I will get to that
 
04:05:22.600 --> 04:05:23.510 align:start position:0%
one major exception I will get to that
major

04:05:23.510 --> 04:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
major
 
04:05:25.790 --> 04:05:25.800 align:start position:0%
exception so although it's a repeal and
 
04:05:27.389 --> 04:05:27.399 align:start position:0%
replace there's no bold to make it easy
 
04:05:30.189 --> 04:05:30.199 align:start position:0%
to read section A of this act is
 
04:05:32.910 --> 04:05:32.920 align:start position:0%
identical to what's in current law this
 
04:05:35.189 --> 04:05:35.199 align:start position:0%
is students who are eligible to receive
 
04:05:37.149 --> 04:05:37.159 align:start position:0%
the education Freedom accounts relative
 
04:05:41.429 --> 04:05:41.439 align:start position:0%
to 300 50% which is the current
 
04:05:44.990 --> 04:05:45.000 align:start position:0%
policy I will come back to section B uh
 
04:05:47.149 --> 04:05:47.159 align:start position:0%
section c I believe is also in the law
 
04:05:49.790 --> 04:05:49.800 align:start position:0%
somewhere um I don't remember where I
 
04:05:52.429 --> 04:05:52.439 align:start position:0%
didn't see it um but this is someone
 
04:05:53.910 --> 04:05:53.920 align:start position:0%
this is a student who tried to get to
 
04:05:55.870 --> 04:05:55.880 align:start position:0%
another school and their school district
 
04:05:58.830 --> 04:05:58.840 align:start position:0%
denied them and then following current
 
04:06:01.469 --> 04:06:01.479 align:start position:0%
policy students who participated this in
 
04:06:04.189 --> 04:06:04.199 align:start position:0%
this current year okay can continue to
 
04:06:06.870 --> 04:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
participate in the future that's that's
 
04:06:08.550 --> 04:06:08.560 align:start position:0%
been the ongoing policy
 
04:06:10.510 --> 04:06:10.520 align:start position:0%
so let's talk about section B CU that is
 
04:06:11.990 --> 04:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
in fact the new
 
04:06:15.269 --> 04:06:15.279 align:start position:0%
section and this has to do with how well
 
04:06:17.429 --> 04:06:17.439 align:start position:0%
the school district is
 
04:06:19.990 --> 04:06:20.000 align:start position:0%
performing we have made this about
 
04:06:21.550 --> 04:06:21.560 align:start position:0%
whether the parents can afford to give
 
04:06:23.950 --> 04:06:23.960 align:start position:0%
their children another option well
 
04:06:26.349 --> 04:06:26.359 align:start position:0%
that's a great metric I think it is an
 
04:06:30.030 --> 04:06:30.040 align:start position:0%
inadequate metric it is the wrong
 
04:06:32.269 --> 04:06:32.279 align:start position:0%
metric currently we send our children in
 
04:06:35.229 --> 04:06:35.239 align:start position:0%
the public schools based on two criteria
 
04:06:37.269 --> 04:06:37.279 align:start position:0%
what ZIP code they live in and what year
 
04:06:38.790 --> 04:06:38.800 align:start position:0%
they were born
 
04:06:41.110 --> 04:06:41.120 align:start position:0%
it has nothing to do with it right
 
04:06:43.309 --> 04:06:43.319 align:start position:0%
academic skill
 
04:06:45.870 --> 04:06:45.880 align:start position:0%
level whether they're an exemplary
 
04:06:47.790 --> 04:06:47.800 align:start position:0%
student and and and should be in an
 
04:06:50.110 --> 04:06:50.120 align:start position:0%
honors program whether they have a
 
04:06:53.750 --> 04:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
learning style that is visual versus
 
04:06:58.670 --> 04:06:58.680 align:start position:0%
Hands-On versus auditory I I'm sure
 
04:06:59.870 --> 04:06:59.880 align:start position:0%
there are a bunch of teachers in here
 
04:07:02.309 --> 04:07:02.319 align:start position:0%
who who could better speak to education
 
04:07:04.950 --> 04:07:04.960 align:start position:0%
learning styles than I can that's not
 
04:07:06.630 --> 04:07:06.640 align:start position:0%
how we send kids to school we send kids
 
04:07:09.309 --> 04:07:09.319 align:start position:0%
to school on zip code and birthday
 
04:07:09.319 --> 04:07:10.309 align:start position:0%
to school on zip code and birthday
that's

04:07:10.309 --> 04:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
that's
 
04:07:12.990 --> 04:07:13.000 align:start position:0%
it the problem is the parents have no
 
04:07:16.349 --> 04:07:16.359 align:start position:0%
option they're told go to the local
 
04:07:18.830 --> 04:07:18.840 align:start position:0%
school I'm going to pick on on on the
 
04:07:21.149 --> 04:07:21.159 align:start position:0%
largest city in Manchester today because
 
04:07:23.389 --> 04:07:23.399 align:start position:0%
I have that particular data up the
 
04:07:26.429 --> 04:07:26.439 align:start position:0%
Department of Education has created a
 
04:07:28.830 --> 04:07:28.840 align:start position:0%
bunch of reports under their website
 
04:07:31.229 --> 04:07:31.239 align:start position:0%
under the IR report I believe is the
 
04:07:32.950 --> 04:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
correct one you can look up the school
 
04:07:35.030 --> 04:07:35.040 align:start position:0%
performance for any District in the
 
04:07:38.389 --> 04:07:38.399 align:start position:0%
state and I'm going to use Manchester as
 
04:07:40.510 --> 04:07:40.520 align:start position:0%
it encompasses the largest number of
 
04:07:42.510 --> 04:07:42.520 align:start position:0%
students in one particular
 
04:07:47.870 --> 04:07:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:51.910 --> 04:07:51.920 align:start position:0%
28% 28% of the students at whatever
 
04:07:53.670 --> 04:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
grade level they're using for testing
 
04:07:55.269 --> 04:07:55.279 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming this is their eighth grade
 
04:07:57.189 --> 04:07:57.199 align:start position:0%
test but it could be
 
04:08:01.030 --> 04:08:01.040 align:start position:0%
others okay are considered proficient in
 
04:08:03.269 --> 04:08:03.279 align:start position:0%
the English
 
04:08:06.870 --> 04:08:06.880 align:start position:0%
language 19% are proficient in math and
 
04:08:10.229 --> 04:08:10.239 align:start position:0%
14% are proficient in
 
04:08:12.349 --> 04:08:12.359 align:start position:0%
science well it's good that we spent a
 
04:08:13.670 --> 04:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
lot of additional or sent a lot of
 
04:08:15.870 --> 04:08:15.880 align:start position:0%
additional money
 
04:08:20.149 --> 04:08:20.159 align:start position:0%
to um Manchester in hb2 last year to the
 
04:08:22.149 --> 04:08:22.159 align:start position:0%
tune of something like $35 million of
 
04:08:25.109 --> 04:08:25.119 align:start position:0%
additional funding those scores are not
 
04:08:27.070 --> 04:08:27.080 align:start position:0%
sufficient to prepare our children for
 
04:08:30.189 --> 04:08:30.199 align:start position:0%
the future we need to do a better
 
04:08:34.070 --> 04:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
job today if a school isn't doing well
 
04:08:36.109 --> 04:08:36.119 align:start position:0%
we send them more money that is how we
 
04:08:38.149 --> 04:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
incentivize schools if you look at the
 
04:08:40.309 --> 04:08:40.319 align:start position:0%
schools and they're doing poorly we pick
 
04:08:42.269 --> 04:08:42.279 align:start position:0%
up and we we know we send them
 
04:08:44.590 --> 04:08:44.600 align:start position:0%
additional money um to help their their
 
04:08:46.990 --> 04:08:47.000 align:start position:0%
children do better
 
04:08:49.389 --> 04:08:49.399 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that rewards at some level
 
04:08:51.870 --> 04:08:51.880 align:start position:0%
bad behavior not bad behavior of the
 
04:08:53.990 --> 04:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
student but bad behavior of the system
 
04:08:56.349 --> 04:08:56.359 align:start position:0%
to educate the
 
04:08:59.590 --> 04:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
children we should in fact find schools
 
04:09:01.469 --> 04:09:01.479 align:start position:0%
that are doing really really well and
 
04:09:03.910 --> 04:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
make sure that they we fund them well so
 
04:09:05.790 --> 04:09:05.800 align:start position:0%
they can educate more children because
 
04:09:10.030 --> 04:09:10.040 align:start position:0%
you might find um I'm part of Dunbarton
 
04:09:11.149 --> 04:09:11.159 align:start position:0%
my children are homeschooled so it
 
04:09:14.149 --> 04:09:14.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't apply to me but if my children
 
04:09:16.830 --> 04:09:16.840 align:start position:0%
were in Dunbarton and we were sending to
 
04:09:18.870 --> 04:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
gown but B was doing better we might
 
04:09:20.910 --> 04:09:20.920 align:start position:0%
want our kids in the bow school system
 
04:09:23.750 --> 04:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
for and as a town we made that
 
04:09:25.990 --> 04:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
decision so that the children are public
 
04:09:27.109 --> 04:09:27.119 align:start position:0%
part of the public school system could
 
04:09:29.510 --> 04:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
go to Bo for a better education Our Town
 
04:09:31.070 --> 04:09:31.080 align:start position:0%
decided to do that they left the gos
 
04:09:33.830 --> 04:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
toown district and went to about but not
 
04:09:35.630 --> 04:09:35.640 align:start position:0%
every parent can do that and if you have
 
04:09:38.269 --> 04:09:38.279 align:start position:0%
to tuition into the other District
 
04:09:39.750 --> 04:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
this would allow you to have access to
 
04:09:43.189 --> 04:09:43.199 align:start position:0%
help financial help to do
 
04:09:45.910 --> 04:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
that so all this bill does is ADD
 
04:09:48.109 --> 04:09:48.119 align:start position:0%
section B and it talks about if the
 
04:09:50.149 --> 04:09:50.159 align:start position:0%
school is not doing a good job making
 
04:09:52.229 --> 04:09:52.239 align:start position:0%
sure the children are educated the
 
04:09:54.550 --> 04:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
parents have another option that option
 
04:09:58.149 --> 04:09:58.159 align:start position:0%
can be any other education it can be
 
04:10:00.469 --> 04:10:00.479 align:start position:0%
another Public School it can be a
 
04:10:02.950 --> 04:10:02.960 align:start position:0%
private school it can be homeschool all
 
04:10:04.750 --> 04:10:04.760 align:start position:0%
the things are available through the
 
04:10:08.590 --> 04:10:08.600 align:start position:0%
efas the only metric that is is is
 
04:10:10.910 --> 04:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
used is what is the school doing in
 
04:10:12.910 --> 04:10:12.920 align:start position:0%
terms of performance is it meeting a
 
04:10:14.590 --> 04:10:14.600 align:start position:0%
reasonable threshold the reasonable
 
04:10:16.550 --> 04:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
threshold that I picked for this bill
 
04:10:20.109 --> 04:10:20.119 align:start position:0%
was that less than half the students are
 
04:10:22.870 --> 04:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
proficient we canjust that number maybe
 
04:10:24.590 --> 04:10:24.600 align:start position:0%
that number's too high maybe we should
 
04:10:27.109 --> 04:10:27.119 align:start position:0%
said it is only 10% of the students are
 
04:10:29.070 --> 04:10:29.080 align:start position:0%
proficient or sorry our failing
 
04:10:30.630 --> 04:10:30.640 align:start position:0%
proficiency maybe it should be 90 I
 
04:10:31.790 --> 04:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
don't know we can we can have a
 
04:10:34.590 --> 04:10:34.600 align:start position:0%
discussion on what that metric is in my
 
04:10:36.309 --> 04:10:36.319 align:start position:0%
eyes if half the if half the children
 
04:10:37.910 --> 04:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
are not proficient in the various
 
04:10:40.349 --> 04:10:40.359 align:start position:0%
subject matters we have not done our job
 
04:10:43.950 --> 04:10:43.960 align:start position:0%
as a state to prepare them for their
 
04:10:47.229 --> 04:10:47.239 align:start position:0%
future with that I'll close my testimony
 
04:10:50.189 --> 04:10:50.199 align:start position:0%
um I'm willing to answer any
 
04:10:52.710 --> 04:10:52.720 align:start position:0%
questions very
 
04:10:56.670 --> 04:10:56.680 align:start position:0%
much yeses thank you thank you and as a
 
04:10:59.030 --> 04:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
Manchester rep I would like to ask you
 
04:11:02.469 --> 04:11:02.479 align:start position:0%
are you saying that Manchester school
 
04:11:06.149 --> 04:11:06.159 align:start position:0%
district is not teaching their children
 
04:11:08.109 --> 04:11:08.119 align:start position:0%
as well as they could
 
04:11:09.870 --> 04:11:09.880 align:start position:0%
because they want to get more funds from
 
04:11:13.109 --> 04:11:13.119 align:start position:0%
the state and not taking into account
 
04:11:15.710 --> 04:11:15.720 align:start position:0%
the percentage of students that we have
 
04:11:18.910 --> 04:11:18.920 align:start position:0%
that are English language Learners um
 
04:11:18.920 --> 04:11:20.349 align:start position:0%
that are English language Learners um
special

04:11:20.349 --> 04:11:20.359 align:start position:0%
special
 
04:11:23.349 --> 04:11:23.359 align:start position:0%
education um
 
04:11:25.790 --> 04:11:25.800 align:start position:0%
disadvantaged I'm not saying that it's
 
04:11:27.429 --> 04:11:27.439 align:start position:0%
that is what you said you said
 
04:11:27.439 --> 04:11:28.910 align:start position:0%
that is what you said you said
Manchester

04:11:28.910 --> 04:11:28.920 align:start position:0%
Manchester
 
04:11:32.710 --> 04:11:32.720 align:start position:0%
is rewarded for their children doing
 
04:11:35.349 --> 04:11:35.359 align:start position:0%
poorly on this test and are being
 
04:11:38.149 --> 04:11:38.159 align:start position:0%
incentivized by low scor to get more
 
04:11:39.990 --> 04:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
money from the
 
04:11:42.149 --> 04:11:42.159 align:start position:0%
state so I'm going to take this as a
 
04:11:45.349 --> 04:11:45.359 align:start position:0%
question and the question was did I say
 
04:11:47.590 --> 04:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
that Manchester intentionally does this
 
04:11:49.429 --> 04:11:49.439 align:start position:0%
no Manchester is not intentionally doing
 
04:11:52.149 --> 04:11:52.159 align:start position:0%
it I'm saying the current statutes and
 
04:11:56.269 --> 04:11:56.279 align:start position:0%
the law and the system incentivizes this
 
04:11:57.830 --> 04:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
whether or not that's an intended
 
04:11:59.790 --> 04:11:59.800 align:start position:0%
consequence or an unintended
 
04:12:02.950 --> 04:12:02.960 align:start position:0%
consequence we send additional money to
 
04:12:04.950 --> 04:12:04.960 align:start position:0%
districts that are doing poorly that is
 
04:12:08.750 --> 04:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
how we treat districts that is a fact
 
04:12:11.510 --> 04:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying that is the policy that
 
04:12:13.550 --> 04:12:13.560 align:start position:0%
we want I'm just saying that is the fact
 
04:12:14.990 --> 04:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
and one of the UN unintended
 
04:12:18.590 --> 04:12:18.600 align:start position:0%
consequences of policies like that is we
 
04:12:20.429 --> 04:12:20.439 align:start position:0%
end up with children aren't doing this
 
04:12:23.070 --> 04:12:23.080 align:start position:0%
well we should look at the Academy for
 
04:12:25.870 --> 04:12:25.880 align:start position:0%
Science and design where they have yes
 
04:12:27.469 --> 04:12:27.479 align:start position:0%
it's a charter school they get to select
 
04:12:29.389 --> 04:12:29.399 align:start position:0%
the students that are participating but
 
04:12:32.630 --> 04:12:32.640 align:start position:0%
look they are they are top nationally in
 
04:12:34.149 --> 04:12:34.159 align:start position:0%
one of the as one of the high schools in
 
04:12:35.910 --> 04:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
the state this is what we should be
 
04:12:37.349 --> 04:12:37.359 align:start position:0%
rewarding this is what we should be be
 
04:12:39.630 --> 04:12:39.640 align:start position:0%
incentivizing more
 
04:12:43.349 --> 04:12:43.359 align:start position:0%
of well not being able to choose what
 
04:12:45.630 --> 04:12:45.640 align:start position:0%
students attend public schools in
 
04:12:48.469 --> 04:12:48.479 align:start position:0%
Manchester because we welcome them all
 
04:12:51.269 --> 04:12:51.279 align:start position:0%
and we do have a large large population
 
04:12:54.550 --> 04:12:54.560 align:start position:0%
of English language Learners special
 
04:12:56.910 --> 04:12:56.920 align:start position:0%
education um and somebody this morning
 
04:12:59.870 --> 04:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
said that Berlin had 60% free and
 
04:13:01.710 --> 04:13:01.720 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch which was large well
 
04:13:04.710 --> 04:13:04.720 align:start position:0%
Manchester schools are way above that so
 
04:13:07.950 --> 04:13:07.960 align:start position:0%
I don't think that they're doing
 
04:13:11.790 --> 04:13:11.800 align:start position:0%
poorly is being incentified by
 
04:13:14.189 --> 04:13:14.199 align:start position:0%
incentified by anything that the state
 
04:13:16.389 --> 04:13:16.399 align:start position:0%
is giving them to score poorly I'm sure
 
04:13:20.189 --> 04:13:20.199 align:start position:0%
they'd rather get less money and have
 
04:13:22.950 --> 04:13:22.960 align:start position:0%
um children do
 
04:13:27.790 --> 04:13:27.800 align:start position:0%
well so the the good news is right
 
04:13:30.429 --> 04:13:30.439 align:start position:0%
through House Bill 2 last year the state
 
04:13:33.910 --> 04:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
budget we made fundamental changes in
 
04:13:36.750 --> 04:13:36.760 align:start position:0%
how the state reimbursed local school
 
04:13:39.030 --> 04:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
districts through the swep
 
04:13:41.469 --> 04:13:41.479 align:start position:0%
account for various things including
 
04:13:44.750 --> 04:13:44.760 align:start position:0%
free and reduced lunch and in the end
 
04:13:46.630 --> 04:13:46.640 align:start position:0%
some of the larger cities Manchester and
 
04:13:48.070 --> 04:13:48.080 align:start position:0%
Nashville in particular I don't know
 
04:13:49.550 --> 04:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
Berlin I I don't remember the numbers
 
04:13:51.830 --> 04:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
for all the towns in the state saw a
 
04:13:54.189 --> 04:13:54.199 align:start position:0%
significant increase in disparity level
 
04:13:57.830 --> 04:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
aid because of right English Learners
 
04:14:00.030 --> 04:14:00.040 align:start position:0%
right free and reduced lunch right lower
 
04:14:03.429 --> 04:14:03.439 align:start position:0%
income households um I get that and
 
04:14:05.950 --> 04:14:05.960 align:start position:0%
maybe the the scores we're seeing today
 
04:14:08.189 --> 04:14:08.199 align:start position:0%
are a result of under fing for years I
 
04:14:10.830 --> 04:14:10.840 align:start position:0%
don't know but I am saying right
 
04:14:14.269 --> 04:14:14.279 align:start position:0%
now those percentages in terms of scores
 
04:14:16.469 --> 04:14:16.479 align:start position:0%
are not we are not doing a job our job
 
04:14:19.429 --> 04:14:19.439 align:start position:0%
as a state educating our children if you
 
04:14:22.349 --> 04:14:22.359 align:start position:0%
look at over time how well we have done
 
04:14:25.389 --> 04:14:25.399 align:start position:0%
to other um industrialized nations first
 
04:14:27.710 --> 04:14:27.720 align:start position:0%
world Nations we have continued to drop
 
04:14:29.870 --> 04:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
in terms of our education performance
 
04:14:32.309 --> 04:14:32.319 align:start position:0%
for the last several decades we have to
 
04:14:36.070 --> 04:14:36.080 align:start position:0%
reverse that Trend this is one way to do
 
04:14:36.080 --> 04:14:41.189 align:start position:0%
reverse that Trend this is one way to do
it

04:14:41.189 --> 04:14:41.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:43.429 --> 04:14:43.439 align:start position:0%
thank you so
 
04:14:45.189 --> 04:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
proficiency what do you think
 
04:14:52.309 --> 04:14:52.319 align:start position:0%
proficiency is is it 60% 70% 80% 90% or
 
04:14:55.109 --> 04:14:55.119 align:start position:0%
100% if in the old terms because we're
 
04:14:57.149 --> 04:14:57.159 align:start position:0%
using this term proficient so in Old
 
04:14:59.309 --> 04:14:59.319 align:start position:0%
terms with with going to school was it
 
04:15:03.229 --> 04:15:03.239 align:start position:0%
an A B C D E was it I would argue that
 
04:15:04.389 --> 04:15:04.399 align:start position:0%
it should
 
04:15:07.550 --> 04:15:07.560 align:start position:0%
be a 70% or better
 
04:15:09.950 --> 04:15:09.960 align:start position:0%
higher than that it's higher than that
 
04:15:12.229 --> 04:15:12.239 align:start position:0%
from the State Department of Education
 
04:15:14.750 --> 04:15:14.760 align:start position:0%
So when you say proficient you're not
 
04:15:16.630 --> 04:15:16.640 align:start position:0%
talking and and you're throwing it
 
04:15:18.870 --> 04:15:18.880 align:start position:0%
around like they're barely passing
 
04:15:20.950 --> 04:15:20.960 align:start position:0%
proficient means that they're up in the
 
04:15:25.750 --> 04:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
80% range and that's a high bar for most
 
04:15:29.189 --> 04:15:29.199 align:start position:0%
kids so you know to throw around the the
 
04:15:31.990 --> 04:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
term proficient and to have
 
04:15:36.590 --> 04:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
48% in proficient is is something that's
 
04:15:39.269 --> 04:15:39.279 align:start position:0%
p in in the sky really it's Pie in the
 
04:15:42.030 --> 04:15:42.040 align:start position:0%
Sky depending and particularly for some
 
04:15:45.349 --> 04:15:45.359 align:start position:0%
place like Manchester Now Now options in
 
04:15:47.349 --> 04:15:47.359 align:start position:0%
Manchester you have how many charter
 
04:15:48.830 --> 04:15:48.840 align:start position:0%
schools in
 
04:15:51.670 --> 04:15:51.680 align:start position:0%
Manchester okay parents have options in
 
04:15:51.680 --> 04:15:52.590 align:start position:0%
Manchester okay parents have options in
in

04:15:52.590 --> 04:15:52.600 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:15:54.950 --> 04:15:54.960 align:start position:0%
Manchester parents have
 
04:15:57.429 --> 04:15:57.439 align:start position:0%
options okay
 
04:16:00.469 --> 04:16:00.479 align:start position:0%
so as far as the proficiency part of
 
04:16:02.309 --> 04:16:02.319 align:start position:0%
this bill and the fact that you said
 
04:16:05.469 --> 04:16:05.479 align:start position:0%
that parents have no options I think is
 
04:16:10.990 --> 04:16:11.000 align:start position:0%
it is not not right not not truthful so
 
04:16:14.149 --> 04:16:14.159 align:start position:0%
if I may follow up to that question what
 
04:16:15.510 --> 04:16:15.520 align:start position:0%
is the right percentage if you're saying
 
04:16:18.469 --> 04:16:18.479 align:start position:0%
it's 85 at what percentage of students
 
04:16:21.910 --> 04:16:21.920 align:start position:0%
should be achieving 85% proficiency I
 
04:16:26.870 --> 04:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
think uh a c uh a c is average yes okay
 
04:16:29.830 --> 04:16:29.840 align:start position:0%
and I think a c average grade if if most
 
04:16:31.389 --> 04:16:31.399 align:start position:0%
of your students at your school are
 
04:16:34.189 --> 04:16:34.199 align:start position:0%
doing C or above and you're always going
 
04:16:36.229 --> 04:16:36.239 align:start position:0%
to have some kids that are at the top of
 
04:16:38.189 --> 04:16:38.199 align:start position:0%
the top of the span you're always going
 
04:16:40.070 --> 04:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
to get a few kids that are at the bottom
 
04:16:43.109 --> 04:16:43.119 align:start position:0%
of the scan that's how it works okay and
 
04:16:45.269 --> 04:16:45.279 align:start position:0%
and Manchester with all the issues that
 
04:16:47.790 --> 04:16:47.800 align:start position:0%
they have any school with any issues
 
04:16:49.950 --> 04:16:49.960 align:start position:0%
that they have and depending year to
 
04:16:52.830 --> 04:16:52.840 align:start position:0%
year to year I mean and like you said
 
04:16:55.710 --> 04:16:55.720 align:start position:0%
some of it is you can't throw say that
 
04:16:58.790 --> 04:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
you threw 35 million at them last year
 
04:17:01.309 --> 04:17:01.319 align:start position:0%
and that this year they should should be
 
04:17:04.389 --> 04:17:04.399 align:start position:0%
48% proficient that that's unreasonable
 
04:17:06.550 --> 04:17:06.560 align:start position:0%
that is I understand that statement and
 
04:17:08.309 --> 04:17:08.319 align:start position:0%
right can support that you can't
 
04:17:11.469 --> 04:17:11.479 align:start position:0%
fundamentally change by 30% the the
 
04:17:13.990 --> 04:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
Proficiency in a single year relative to
 
04:17:17.030 --> 04:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
funding but I do believe we should have
 
04:17:18.990 --> 04:17:19.000 align:start position:0%
far more
 
04:17:22.950 --> 04:17:22.960 align:start position:0%
than 10% of the kids at 85% or better if
 
04:17:23.950 --> 04:17:23.960 align:start position:0%
you're using
 
04:17:28.309 --> 04:17:28.319 align:start position:0%
85 in my eyes 25% of the students should
 
04:17:31.030 --> 04:17:31.040 align:start position:0%
be b or higher level work if they're
 
04:17:32.830 --> 04:17:32.840 align:start position:0%
doing and it's only because of how the
 
04:17:35.030 --> 04:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
tests are set up and this is relative to
 
04:17:38.189 --> 04:17:38.199 align:start position:0%
the National capability we we have New
 
04:17:40.550 --> 04:17:40.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has since I sat on education
 
04:17:40.560 --> 04:17:41.510 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has since I sat on education
in

04:17:41.510 --> 04:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:17:43.830 --> 04:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
20112 okay has been one of the states
 
04:17:46.670 --> 04:17:46.680 align:start position:0%
with a better education system can we do
 
04:17:48.950 --> 04:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
better absolutely relative to other
 
04:17:51.109 --> 04:17:51.119 align:start position:0%
industrialized nations we're not doing
 
04:17:53.269 --> 04:17:53.279 align:start position:0%
that well anymore we are not preparing
 
04:17:55.510 --> 04:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
our our children for the future and
 
04:17:56.870 --> 04:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
that's what needs to be
 
04:17:58.950 --> 04:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
fixed what was the what was the
 
04:18:01.429 --> 04:18:01.439 align:start position:0%
proficiency level question yeah just
 
04:18:03.630 --> 04:18:03.640 align:start position:0%
what what was the proficiency level of
 
04:18:07.309 --> 04:18:07.319 align:start position:0%
Manchester 28% in English that's above
 
04:18:10.910 --> 04:18:10.920 align:start position:0%
10 19 in math and 14 in science right so
 
04:18:15.309 --> 04:18:15.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:18.670 --> 04:18:18.680 align:start position:0%
10% further
 
04:18:20.630 --> 04:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
question thank you and thank you for
 
04:18:24.990 --> 04:18:25.000 align:start position:0%
being here um it's unfortunate that in
 
04:18:27.269 --> 04:18:27.279 align:start position:0%
the last 30 years this legislature has
 
04:18:29.870 --> 04:18:29.880 align:start position:0%
failed to meet its obligation according
 
04:18:31.910 --> 04:18:31.920 align:start position:0%
to the Court decisions around school
 
04:18:34.710 --> 04:18:34.720 align:start position:0%
funding so that's just just to say it
 
04:18:36.429 --> 04:18:36.439 align:start position:0%
question that I the question I have for
 
04:18:38.870 --> 04:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
you is that as I read
 
04:18:41.510 --> 04:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
B If This Were to become
 
04:18:46.070 --> 04:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
law the only qualifications for a uh
 
04:18:49.349 --> 04:18:49.359 align:start position:0%
family who wants to have an EFA would be
 
04:18:51.990 --> 04:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
that they would be in the 40%
 
04:18:54.389 --> 04:18:54.399 align:start position:0%
49% or in
 
04:18:57.590 --> 04:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
48% proficiency and there'd be no other
 
04:19:00.670 --> 04:19:00.680 align:start position:0%
qualifications so there'd be no 350 you
 
04:19:03.070 --> 04:19:03.080 align:start position:0%
don't have to qualify from a standpoint
 
04:19:05.030 --> 04:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
of income or anything like that it's
 
04:19:07.149 --> 04:19:07.159 align:start position:0%
basically what the proficiency level
 
04:19:09.469 --> 04:19:09.479 align:start position:0%
would be of that district is that
 
04:19:12.109 --> 04:19:12.119 align:start position:0%
correct that is correct this is this is
 
04:19:15.229 --> 04:19:15.239 align:start position:0%
about school district performance and if
 
04:19:16.269 --> 04:19:16.279 align:start position:0%
the children aren't getting the
 
04:19:18.389 --> 04:19:18.399 align:start position:0%
education they need that additional
 
04:19:28.390 --> 04:19:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:28.400 --> 04:19:31.030 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:19:31.030 --> 04:19:31.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:19:33.109 --> 04:19:33.119 align:start position:0%
available thank you Mr chair thank you
 
04:19:34.510 --> 04:19:34.520 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
04:19:38.349 --> 04:19:38.359 align:start position:0%
question so could you comment please
 
04:19:42.910 --> 04:19:42.920 align:start position:0%
since there is no testing or assessment
 
04:19:46.990 --> 04:19:47.000 align:start position:0%
standard for students educated through
 
04:19:49.710 --> 04:19:49.720 align:start position:0%
NFA If This Were to pass how would we
 
04:19:51.309 --> 04:19:51.319 align:start position:0%
know that they were becoming more
 
04:19:54.349 --> 04:19:54.359 align:start position:0%
proficient than in their current Public
 
04:19:57.790 --> 04:19:57.800 align:start position:0%
Schools so in most cases with EFA it
 
04:20:00.870 --> 04:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
does not cover the 100% of the net of
 
04:20:03.309 --> 04:20:03.319 align:start position:0%
the costs of right going to an outside
 
04:20:06.229 --> 04:20:06.239 align:start position:0%
thing right so if the parents don't see
 
04:20:08.790 --> 04:20:08.800 align:start position:0%
the performance they want the parents
 
04:20:10.349 --> 04:20:10.359 align:start position:0%
themselves would choose to go back to
 
04:20:12.070 --> 04:20:12.080 align:start position:0%
the public education system because they
 
04:20:13.349 --> 04:20:13.359 align:start position:0%
don't have to write a check for the
 
04:20:15.830 --> 04:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
difference unless that because they are
 
04:20:17.910 --> 04:20:17.920 align:start position:0%
now an active consumer meaning they're
 
04:20:19.349 --> 04:20:19.359 align:start position:0%
looking at their performance they're
 
04:20:20.750 --> 04:20:20.760 align:start position:0%
looking at how their children are doing
 
04:20:22.790 --> 04:20:22.800 align:start position:0%
in the school if they don't see an
 
04:20:25.229 --> 04:20:25.239 align:start position:0%
increase in in how their children are
 
04:20:27.630 --> 04:20:27.640 align:start position:0%
doing right there's no reason for them
 
04:20:29.389 --> 04:20:29.399 align:start position:0%
to continue to write
 
04:20:29.399 --> 04:20:31.349 align:start position:0%
to continue to write
checks

04:20:31.349 --> 04:20:31.359 align:start position:0%
checks
 
04:20:34.670 --> 04:20:34.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:37.070 --> 04:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
you so if I'm understanding you
 
04:20:39.950 --> 04:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
correctly you don't see any relevance or
 
04:20:44.189 --> 04:20:44.199 align:start position:0%
need for there to be more objective than
 
04:20:44.199 --> 04:20:46.070 align:start position:0%
need for there to be more objective than
parental

04:20:46.070 --> 04:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
parental
 
04:20:49.950 --> 04:20:49.960 align:start position:0%
observation of the results of this
 
04:20:52.630 --> 04:20:52.640 align:start position:0%
education system that is at least partly
 
04:20:54.870 --> 04:20:54.880 align:start position:0%
tax Fair
 
04:20:58.670 --> 04:20:58.680 align:start position:0%
funded so I am a strong proponent for
 
04:21:00.469 --> 04:21:00.479 align:start position:0%
free market Solutions where the
 
04:21:02.389 --> 04:21:02.399 align:start position:0%
consumers have some say in what they
 
04:21:05.670 --> 04:21:05.680 align:start position:0%
what they buy and because of that they
 
04:21:07.510 --> 04:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
use their money
 
04:21:10.590 --> 04:21:10.600 align:start position:0%
wisely and in this case it's the parents
 
04:21:11.750 --> 04:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
who are looking at how well their
 
04:21:13.830 --> 04:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
children are doing and I do believe
 
04:21:15.990 --> 04:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
since the parents are writing the check
 
04:21:17.790 --> 04:21:17.800 align:start position:0%
they're the consumers right they're not
 
04:21:19.109 --> 04:21:19.119 align:start position:0%
they're not being educated but they're
 
04:21:21.510 --> 04:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
the ones making the purchase that they
 
04:21:23.870 --> 04:21:23.880 align:start position:0%
will do what is best for their
 
04:21:26.229 --> 04:21:26.239 align:start position:0%
children and because of that they will
 
04:21:28.149 --> 04:21:28.159 align:start position:0%
be very attentive to yes my children are
 
04:21:30.030 --> 04:21:30.040 align:start position:0%
learning or not learning in moving to
 
04:21:31.630 --> 04:21:31.640 align:start position:0%
the school I didn't see any additional
 
04:21:33.830 --> 04:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
progress right they're they're not up to
 
04:21:35.910 --> 04:21:35.920 align:start position:0%
what I believe is a reasonable standard
 
04:21:39.590 --> 04:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
and there for they would choose not to
 
04:21:43.229 --> 04:21:43.239 align:start position:0%
continue thank you for your
 
04:21:45.830 --> 04:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
answer thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:21:49.429 --> 04:21:49.439 align:start position:0%
rep hole um we've heard a lot about
 
04:21:51.349 --> 04:21:51.359 align:start position:0%
proficiency and larger populations but
 
04:21:53.229 --> 04:21:53.239 align:start position:0%
I'd like to get a little bit more
 
04:21:56.790 --> 04:21:56.800 align:start position:0%
granular um so we're talking proficiency
 
04:21:58.790 --> 04:21:58.800 align:start position:0%
and this bill would allow students at
 
04:22:01.389 --> 04:22:01.399 align:start position:0%
schools that are of low Prof proficiency
 
04:22:04.790 --> 04:22:04.800 align:start position:0%
to be able to go elsewhere can you can
 
04:22:07.630 --> 04:22:07.640 align:start position:0%
you imagine that in a school tool that
 
04:22:09.950 --> 04:22:09.960 align:start position:0%
is generally of low proficiency and
 
04:22:11.710 --> 04:22:11.720 align:start position:0%
would likely therefore need to spend a
 
04:22:13.109 --> 04:22:13.119 align:start position:0%
considerable amount of time and effort
 
04:22:16.189 --> 04:22:16.199 align:start position:0%
into remediation and improving uh those
 
04:22:19.550 --> 04:22:19.560 align:start position:0%
scores and uh proficiencies that there
 
04:22:22.469 --> 04:22:22.479 align:start position:0%
might be students who are proficient
 
04:22:24.670 --> 04:22:24.680 align:start position:0%
perhaps having mastered subjects and are
 
04:22:27.590 --> 04:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
possibly even gifted who could be left
 
04:22:30.750 --> 04:22:30.760 align:start position:0%
behind and not meet their full potential
 
04:22:35.349 --> 04:22:35.359 align:start position:0%
in such an environment absolutely thank
 
04:22:35.359 --> 04:22:38.429 align:start position:0%
in such an environment absolutely thank
you

04:22:38.429 --> 04:22:38.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:39.910 --> 04:22:39.920 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative for
 
04:22:42.070 --> 04:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
being here
 
04:22:47.710 --> 04:22:47.720 align:start position:0%
um is the uh 49% proficiency level um
 
04:22:52.870 --> 04:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
criteria for uh Ela or science or math e
 
04:22:54.790 --> 04:22:54.800 align:start position:0%
any one of those three they would
 
04:22:56.990 --> 04:22:57.000 align:start position:0%
qualify that is how it is currently
 
04:22:58.870 --> 04:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
drafted right they are those three
 
04:23:02.510 --> 04:23:02.520 align:start position:0%
options are ored together right um and I
 
04:23:04.429 --> 04:23:04.439 align:start position:0%
did that because you might have a
 
04:23:06.550 --> 04:23:06.560 align:start position:0%
student who wants to be a stem major
 
04:23:08.710 --> 04:23:08.720 align:start position:0%
right where either math or science is is
 
04:23:10.870 --> 04:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
insufficient for them to achieve their
 
04:23:17.469 --> 04:23:17.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:19.469 --> 04:23:19.479 align:start position:0%
curriculum thank you Mr chair and thank
 
04:23:22.429 --> 04:23:22.439 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um your your
 
04:23:25.630 --> 04:23:25.640 align:start position:0%
statistics are the 49% of the schools
 
04:23:27.269 --> 04:23:27.279 align:start position:0%
that's your criteria but there could be
 
04:23:29.429 --> 04:23:29.439 align:start position:0%
students within those schools that are
 
04:23:31.910 --> 04:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
highing that are scoring higher and
 
04:23:34.269 --> 04:23:34.279 align:start position:0%
doing fine in those
 
04:23:36.349 --> 04:23:36.359 align:start position:0%
schools correct that is I think
 
04:23:38.030 --> 04:23:38.040 align:start position:0%
representative beler just made that
 
04:23:39.550 --> 04:23:39.560 align:start position:0%
comment you might you might have a
 
04:23:42.189 --> 04:23:42.199 align:start position:0%
student who is doing very well in that
 
04:23:44.950 --> 04:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
school okay whose parents want them to
 
04:23:44.960 --> 04:23:45.830 align:start position:0%
school okay whose parents want them to
do

04:23:45.830 --> 04:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
do
 
04:23:49.149 --> 04:23:49.159 align:start position:0%
better so well conversely you could look
 
04:23:50.910 --> 04:23:50.920 align:start position:0%
at it the other way there could be
 
04:23:54.269 --> 04:23:54.279 align:start position:0%
students that are in higher uh schools
 
04:23:56.990 --> 04:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
higher achieving schools that are doing
 
04:24:00.349 --> 04:24:00.359 align:start position:0%
poorly that is true as well right I I
 
04:24:03.189 --> 04:24:03.199 align:start position:0%
think the point is as a as a whole that
 
04:24:05.429 --> 04:24:05.439 align:start position:0%
school system is is has some average
 
04:24:07.750 --> 04:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
performance and that average performance
 
04:24:09.790 --> 04:24:09.800 align:start position:0%
is a great metric to figure out whether
 
04:24:12.149 --> 04:24:12.159 align:start position:0%
parents should have other options back
 
04:24:14.189 --> 04:24:14.199 align:start position:0%
to my opening remarks we currently
 
04:24:16.149 --> 04:24:16.159 align:start position:0%
assign school districts based on two
 
04:24:20.070 --> 04:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
criteria zip code and age that's it not
 
04:24:22.269 --> 04:24:22.279 align:start position:0%
learning style not learning capability
 
04:24:25.590 --> 04:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
or aptitude not historic performance not
 
04:24:28.389 --> 04:24:28.399 align:start position:0%
what kind of career they want any of the
 
04:24:30.189 --> 04:24:30.199 align:start position:0%
other reasonable metrics to figure out
 
04:24:32.750 --> 04:24:32.760 align:start position:0%
how to educate somebody we're not using
 
04:24:34.670 --> 04:24:34.680 align:start position:0%
those we're using zip code and
 
04:24:37.910 --> 04:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
age um and I think everybody has a
 
04:24:40.229 --> 04:24:40.239 align:start position:0%
unique learning style we tend to put
 
04:24:42.269 --> 04:24:42.279 align:start position:0%
them in large buckets right some are
 
04:24:44.149 --> 04:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
auditory learn Learners some are
 
04:24:46.630 --> 04:24:46.640 align:start position:0%
Hands-On some are visual Learners I'm
 
04:24:49.189 --> 04:24:49.199 align:start position:0%
sure there's somebody here who has much
 
04:24:50.870 --> 04:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
greater skills in terms of describing
 
04:24:52.790 --> 04:24:52.800 align:start position:0%
those learning styles but at the end of
 
04:24:55.070 --> 04:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
the day we want our children to do the
 
04:24:56.670 --> 04:24:56.680 align:start position:0%
best possible right to have the best
 
04:25:05.070 --> 04:25:05.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:07.349 --> 04:25:07.359 align:start position:0%
them not see anything thank you
 
04:25:35.070 --> 04:25:35.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:35.080 --> 04:27:02.870 align:start position:0%
 
education

04:27:02.870 --> 04:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:07.790 --> 04:27:07.800 align:start position:0%
sure uh this will go into EX session for
 
04:27:09.670 --> 04:27:09.680 align:start position:0%

okay okay now I got to find the right
 
04:30:27.149 --> 04:30:27.159 align:start position:0%

I represent Rockingham 25 it's the town

of Salem um I did uh email you all
 
04:41:01.150 --> 04:41:01.160 align:start position:0%
earlier a copy of my introductory
 
04:41:03.230 --> 04:41:03.240 align:start position:0%
testimony um and I gave a copy to the
 
04:41:05.708 --> 04:41:05.718 align:start position:0%
clerk and I won't uh simply read off the
 
04:41:07.510 --> 04:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
letter but I'll try to just speak from
 
04:41:09.948 --> 04:41:09.958 align:start position:0%
from the heart here uh I I sit before
 
04:41:12.510 --> 04:41:12.520 align:start position:0%
you as the proud product of our New
 
04:41:15.110 --> 04:41:15.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Public Schools uh and really I
 
04:41:16.788 --> 04:41:16.798 align:start position:0%
would only be here because of the public
 
04:41:18.788 --> 04:41:18.798 align:start position:0%
schools in our state when I was four
 
04:41:21.350 --> 04:41:21.360 align:start position:0%
years old I could only coherently
 
04:41:24.510 --> 04:41:24.520 align:start position:0%
communicate 27 words uh and I required
 
04:41:26.590 --> 04:41:26.600 align:start position:0%
three years of extensive speech therapy
 
04:41:29.470 --> 04:41:29.480 align:start position:0%
to get caught up with my peers uh in
 
04:41:32.510 --> 04:41:32.520 align:start position:0%
order to uh speak and communicate well
 
04:41:34.590 --> 04:41:34.600 align:start position:0%
uh among my age group um and I received
 
04:41:36.390 --> 04:41:36.400 align:start position:0%
Reed that therapy through the Salem
 
04:41:38.470 --> 04:41:38.480 align:start position:0%
School District through the seed program
 
04:41:39.708 --> 04:41:39.718 align:start position:0%
and I'm very proud of that school
 
04:41:41.670 --> 04:41:41.680 align:start position:0%
district I'm very proud of that program
 
04:41:43.150 --> 04:41:43.160 align:start position:0%
uh it's a program that continu to this
 
04:41:45.510 --> 04:41:45.520 align:start position:0%
day in the town of Salem and our schools
 
04:41:47.270 --> 04:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
uh and it it's it's those sorts of
 
04:41:49.550 --> 04:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
investments in our community uh that are
 
04:41:51.430 --> 04:41:51.440 align:start position:0%
cherish in the granite state and and
 
04:41:53.310 --> 04:41:53.320 align:start position:0%
truly is the only reason I haven't
 
04:41:55.110 --> 04:41:55.120 align:start position:0%
really stopped talking since I took my
 
04:41:59.110 --> 04:41:59.120 align:start position:0%
speech therapy um when I four to seven
 
04:42:00.708 --> 04:42:00.718 align:start position:0%
uh but it is really the only way that I
 
04:42:03.788 --> 04:42:03.798 align:start position:0%
am here today uh which is in support of
 
04:42:05.350 --> 04:42:05.360 align:start position:0%
of HB
 
04:42:08.550 --> 04:42:08.560 align:start position:0%
1561 uh when I think of our our wildly
 
04:42:10.470 --> 04:42:10.480 align:start position:0%
successful education Freedom accounts
 
04:42:12.590 --> 04:42:12.600 align:start position:0%
program I want to make sure that we can
 
04:42:15.070 --> 04:42:15.080 align:start position:0%
take the next steps to ensure that
 
04:42:17.310 --> 04:42:17.320 align:start position:0%
students that might not feel safe in
 
04:42:19.230 --> 04:42:19.240 align:start position:0%
their school districts or students that
 
04:42:21.670 --> 04:42:21.680 align:start position:0%
are not currently being successful have
 
04:42:23.910 --> 04:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
the options to take advantage of our
 
04:42:26.150 --> 04:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
educational Freedom accounts uh so that
 
04:42:28.350 --> 04:42:28.360 align:start position:0%
they can pursue education that matters
 
04:42:31.510 --> 04:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
uh and works for them in Salem for me
 
04:42:33.470 --> 04:42:33.480 align:start position:0%
that was education that was provided by
 
04:42:34.990 --> 04:42:35.000 align:start position:0%
my local uh public Public School
 
04:42:37.190 --> 04:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
District however I I fully recognize
 
04:42:40.070 --> 04:42:40.080 align:start position:0%
that Salem as a very property rich town
 
04:42:41.868 --> 04:42:41.878 align:start position:0%
uh is not representative of the state
 
04:42:43.868 --> 04:42:43.878 align:start position:0%
when it comes to what is being offered
 
04:42:45.310 --> 04:42:45.320 align:start position:0%
and what is available to students
 
04:42:47.270 --> 04:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
throughout New Hampshire uh which is
 
04:42:50.030 --> 04:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
what this category uh type bill for
 
04:42:52.070 --> 04:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
qualifications really does seek to do
 
04:42:54.110 --> 04:42:54.120 align:start position:0%
there's a number of qu of categories in
 
04:42:56.230 --> 04:42:56.240 align:start position:0%
this bill uh that we would expand
 
04:42:57.910 --> 04:42:57.920 align:start position:0%
coverage of the education Freedom
 
04:43:00.868 --> 04:43:00.878 align:start position:0%
accounts too um and it was really as I
 
04:43:02.510 --> 04:43:02.520 align:start position:0%
talked to the co-sponsors of the bill
 
04:43:05.430 --> 04:43:05.440 align:start position:0%
and stakeholders uh a list of categories
 
04:43:07.788 --> 04:43:07.798 align:start position:0%
that would best benefit from access to
 
04:43:09.788 --> 04:43:09.798 align:start position:0%
educational Freedom accounts if for
 
04:43:11.708 --> 04:43:11.718 align:start position:0%
whatever reason they feel unsafe in
 
04:43:13.470 --> 04:43:13.480 align:start position:0%
their school districts so they feel that
 
04:43:15.708 --> 04:43:15.718 align:start position:0%
their schools are not providing them the
 
04:43:18.150 --> 04:43:18.160 align:start position:0%
the tools to succeed necessary hence
 
04:43:19.948 --> 04:43:19.958 align:start position:0%
there are elements here of of
 
04:43:22.150 --> 04:43:22.160 align:start position:0%
standardized test scores being factored
 
04:43:24.070 --> 04:43:24.080 align:start position:0%
in at the school district level and the
 
04:43:26.868 --> 04:43:26.878 align:start position:0%
individual student uh to qualify for
 
04:43:29.230 --> 04:43:29.240 align:start position:0%
educational Freedom accounts um as well
 
04:43:32.510 --> 04:43:32.520 align:start position:0%
as different categories of mental health
 
04:43:34.910 --> 04:43:34.920 align:start position:0%
of how the student identifies of how
 
04:43:37.270 --> 04:43:37.280 align:start position:0%
that student uh what the district has to
 
04:43:39.510 --> 04:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
offer if there's a contamination in the
 
04:43:42.590 --> 04:43:42.600 align:start position:0%
school district of pasas uh or if if the
 
04:43:45.070 --> 04:43:45.080 align:start position:0%
student or their family is afraid of
 
04:43:46.990 --> 04:43:47.000 align:start position:0%
catching a disease at the school
 
04:43:48.948 --> 04:43:48.958 align:start position:0%
district that they can then apply and
 
04:43:51.550 --> 04:43:51.560 align:start position:0%
qualify for educational Freedom accounts
 
04:43:53.190 --> 04:43:53.200 align:start position:0%
uh I'm happy to take any questions of it
 
04:43:55.150 --> 04:43:55.160 align:start position:0%
I did detail this all in the testimony
 
04:43:56.310 --> 04:43:56.320 align:start position:0%
that I sent over I don't want to
 
04:43:59.350 --> 04:43:59.360 align:start position:0%
certainly be duplicative of that process
 
04:44:00.830 --> 04:44:00.840 align:start position:0%
um but I'm happy to take any questions
 
04:44:02.868 --> 04:44:02.878 align:start position:0%
from the committee as you see fit and I
 
04:44:04.190 --> 04:44:04.200 align:start position:0%
know there were others here to talk as
 
04:44:06.948 --> 04:44:06.958 align:start position:0%
well very much your speech paist did a
 
04:44:11.470 --> 04:44:11.480 align:start position:0%
good job thank you this they did
 
04:44:14.190 --> 04:44:14.200 align:start position:0%
question uh thank you Mr chair thank you
 
04:44:16.708 --> 04:44:16.718 align:start position:0%
for being there and I'm glad you were a
 
04:44:20.030 --> 04:44:20.040 align:start position:0%
success out of Salem uh as I'm look at
 
04:44:21.510 --> 04:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
several these
 
04:44:24.190 --> 04:44:24.200 align:start position:0%
categories uh it seems to me that many
 
04:44:26.030 --> 04:44:26.040 align:start position:0%
of these categories would fall into a
 
04:44:28.708 --> 04:44:28.718 align:start position:0%
manifest hardship situation which we
 
04:44:30.470 --> 04:44:30.480 align:start position:0%
currently have in school districts and
 
04:44:33.350 --> 04:44:33.360 align:start position:0%
superintendents do exercise that now I
 
04:44:35.070 --> 04:44:35.080 align:start position:0%
don't think whether the p fast for
 
04:44:36.948 --> 04:44:36.958 align:start position:0%
example that wouldn't I don't think that
 
04:44:36.958 --> 04:44:37.750 align:start position:0%
example that wouldn't I don't think that
would

04:44:37.750 --> 04:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
would
 
04:44:42.750 --> 04:44:42.760 align:start position:0%
qualify but clearly The Bullying the the
 
04:44:42.760 --> 04:44:43.948 align:start position:0%
qualify but clearly The Bullying the the
sexual

04:44:43.948 --> 04:44:43.958 align:start position:0%
sexual
 
04:44:46.510 --> 04:44:46.520 align:start position:0%
orientation um others would already
 
04:44:49.470 --> 04:44:49.480 align:start position:0%
qualify for a parent to deal with a
 
04:44:52.270 --> 04:44:52.280 align:start position:0%
school system to have that their child
 
04:44:53.910 --> 04:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
plac in another are you aware of the
 
04:44:56.510 --> 04:44:56.520 align:start position:0%
Manifest hardship I I am aware of it and
 
04:44:58.070 --> 04:44:58.080 align:start position:0%
I think it's a great precedent for this
 
04:45:00.310 --> 04:45:00.320 align:start position:0%
bill to make those students eligible for
 
04:45:01.990 --> 04:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
educational Freedom accounts regardless
 
04:45:08.150 --> 04:45:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:12.788 --> 04:45:12.798 align:start position:0%
um are do you know whether uh all the
 
04:45:15.110 --> 04:45:15.120 align:start position:0%
places that the person could use the
 
04:45:18.670 --> 04:45:18.680 align:start position:0%
efas would be willing to accept these
 
04:45:21.750 --> 04:45:21.760 align:start position:0%
people I I don't see any reason uh why
 
04:45:23.948 --> 04:45:23.958 align:start position:0%
not why they would not um and I believe
 
04:45:25.788 --> 04:45:25.798 align:start position:0%
if we empower the parents to make that
 
04:45:27.750 --> 04:45:27.760 align:start position:0%
decision with their education uh it
 
04:45:29.670 --> 04:45:29.680 align:start position:0%
would not only over open up more
 
04:45:31.230 --> 04:45:31.240 align:start position:0%
opportunities in New Hampshire for
 
04:45:33.350 --> 04:45:33.360 align:start position:0%
educational opportunities and freedom
 
04:45:35.030 --> 04:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
for the students uh but they would
 
04:45:36.470 --> 04:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
absolutely be able to find the pathway
 
04:45:39.110 --> 04:45:39.120 align:start position:0%
that works best for them so so just as a
 
04:45:42.590 --> 04:45:42.600 align:start position:0%
followup to that so you're saying that
 
04:45:46.430 --> 04:45:46.440 align:start position:0%
if I'm a parent and my kid is in one of
 
04:45:48.310 --> 04:45:48.320 align:start position:0%
these categories that I can be assured
 
04:45:49.628 --> 04:45:49.638 align:start position:0%
when I take that
 
04:45:52.350 --> 04:45:52.360 align:start position:0%
EFA uh and apply it to the different
 
04:45:55.948 --> 04:45:55.958 align:start position:0%
places that are taking efas that all of
 
04:45:58.750 --> 04:45:58.760 align:start position:0%
them will accept me and my kid I'm not
 
04:46:00.470 --> 04:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
going to speak for any of the individual
 
04:46:02.708 --> 04:46:02.718 align:start position:0%
institutions but I feel as if those
 
04:46:04.270 --> 04:46:04.280 align:start position:0%
parents within our educational system
 
04:46:06.070 --> 04:46:06.080 align:start position:0%
system and with the the options that are
 
04:46:07.310 --> 04:46:07.320 align:start position:0%
available to them that they are
 
04:46:09.990 --> 04:46:10.000 align:start position:0%
empowered by efas we'll be able to find
 
04:46:12.230 --> 04:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
the path that accepts them and works for
 
04:46:16.430 --> 04:46:16.440 align:start position:0%
them okay just so yeah one more so my
 
04:46:18.750 --> 04:46:18.760 align:start position:0%
point is that public schools have to
 
04:46:21.590 --> 04:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
accept everybody so they're accepting
 
04:46:24.350 --> 04:46:24.360 align:start position:0%
people who are lgbtq they're accepting
 
04:46:27.670 --> 04:46:27.680 align:start position:0%
people that may be exposed to P fast or
 
04:46:31.510 --> 04:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
whatever but not it seems to me not all
 
04:46:35.310 --> 04:46:35.320 align:start position:0%
places that are accepting efas are are
 
04:46:37.270 --> 04:46:37.280 align:start position:0%
accepting those people and I'm just
 
04:46:40.708 --> 04:46:40.718 align:start position:0%
wondering how that so so okay we're
 
04:46:42.830 --> 04:46:42.840 align:start position:0%
saying great parents you got all these
 
04:46:44.948 --> 04:46:44.958 align:start position:0%
choices and then they go to exercise
 
04:46:47.110 --> 04:46:47.120 align:start position:0%
those choices in fact we had this with
 
04:46:50.868 --> 04:46:50.878 align:start position:0%
one other group and and the school the
 
04:46:53.510 --> 04:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
organization or whatever it is the won't
 
04:46:56.310 --> 04:46:56.320 align:start position:0%
accept them so how do you think you
 
04:46:58.948 --> 04:46:58.958 align:start position:0%
should Rectify that well I I would say
 
04:47:00.430 --> 04:47:00.440 align:start position:0%
that if the public school is so
 
04:47:01.868 --> 04:47:01.878 align:start position:0%
accepting of these students and it's
 
04:47:03.548 --> 04:47:03.558 align:start position:0%
still failing them and not serving their
 
04:47:05.548 --> 04:47:05.558 align:start position:0%
needs and they feel unsafe or
 
04:47:07.310 --> 04:47:07.320 align:start position:0%
unsuccessful in that school district
 
04:47:09.310 --> 04:47:09.320 align:start position:0%
then it's really not Acceptance in the
 
04:47:11.190 --> 04:47:11.200 align:start position:0%
public school just because they say
 
04:47:12.788 --> 04:47:12.798 align:start position:0%
they're willing to accept those
 
04:47:14.948 --> 04:47:14.958 align:start position:0%
categories uh and I believe the parents
 
04:47:16.910 --> 04:47:16.920 align:start position:0%
would find those institutions and those
 
04:47:19.070 --> 04:47:19.080 align:start position:0%
organizations that are willing to accept
 
04:47:21.590 --> 04:47:21.600 align:start position:0%
their child and their student and put
 
04:47:23.350 --> 04:47:23.360 align:start position:0%
them on the education pathway that works
 
04:47:25.708 --> 04:47:25.718 align:start position:0%
best for them so I I I would I would
 
04:47:27.390 --> 04:47:27.400 align:start position:0%
argue that a public school that may be
 
04:47:29.910 --> 04:47:29.920 align:start position:0%
accepting on paper but is still failing
 
04:47:33.070 --> 04:47:33.080 align:start position:0%
the student isn't accepting at
 
04:47:33.080 --> 04:47:35.230 align:start position:0%
the student isn't accepting at
all

04:47:35.230 --> 04:47:35.240 align:start position:0%
all
 
04:47:37.030 --> 04:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
thank you are there other questions from
 
04:47:37.040 --> 04:47:37.868 align:start position:0%
thank you are there other questions from
the

04:47:37.868 --> 04:47:37.878 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:47:41.430 --> 04:47:41.440 align:start position:0%
committee yes represent Bon thank you Mr
 
04:47:42.708 --> 04:47:42.718 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
04:47:45.470 --> 04:47:45.480 align:start position:0%
question um I'm just looking at line
 
04:47:50.548 --> 04:47:50.558 align:start position:0%
11b and it's very broad it says um that
 
04:47:52.830 --> 04:47:52.840 align:start position:0%
who is concerned that attending school
 
04:47:55.310 --> 04:47:55.320 align:start position:0%
could lead to the spread of contagious
 
04:47:58.070 --> 04:47:58.080 align:start position:0%
diseases such as covid-19 the common
 
04:48:00.788 --> 04:48:00.798 align:start position:0%
cold the seasonal flu pneumonia and
 
04:48:04.110 --> 04:48:04.120 align:start position:0%
other similar diseases it it just says
 
04:48:06.070 --> 04:48:06.080 align:start position:0%
that you have a
 
04:48:08.590 --> 04:48:08.600 align:start position:0%
concern um it seems to me that it's a
 
04:48:10.070 --> 04:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
very broad
 
04:48:13.910 --> 04:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
category uh well we have experienced in
 
04:48:16.270 --> 04:48:16.280 align:start position:0%
the past lockdowns due to diseases and
 
04:48:18.670 --> 04:48:18.680 align:start position:0%
trying to control the spread of it um
 
04:48:20.750 --> 04:48:20.760 align:start position:0%
the lockdown era is is gone and I hope
 
04:48:23.230 --> 04:48:23.240 align:start position:0%
it never comes back but if a family or a
 
04:48:25.390 --> 04:48:25.400 align:start position:0%
student is still worried about the the
 
04:48:27.270 --> 04:48:27.280 align:start position:0%
potential to catch a disease and they
 
04:48:29.110 --> 04:48:29.120 align:start position:0%
don't currently qualify for educational
 
04:48:30.708 --> 04:48:30.718 align:start position:0%
Freedom accounts I think we should be
 
04:48:33.510 --> 04:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
able to make them available to them it
 
04:48:35.270 --> 04:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
may be it may be a broad category but
 
04:48:37.110 --> 04:48:37.120 align:start position:0%
that's up to the individual family to
 
04:48:38.990 --> 04:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
determine if they're worried about
 
04:48:41.350 --> 04:48:41.360 align:start position:0%
getting sick or catching a a
 
04:48:44.628 --> 04:48:44.638 align:start position:0%
transmittable disease at their
 
04:48:46.948 --> 04:48:46.958 align:start position:0%
school thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
04:48:50.910 --> 04:48:50.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question I mean to the same um
 
04:48:53.788 --> 04:48:53.798 align:start position:0%
line item that specifically
 
04:48:56.830 --> 04:48:56.840 align:start position:0%
describes um contagious diseases
 
04:48:58.910 --> 04:48:58.920 align:start position:0%
including the common
 
04:49:02.548 --> 04:49:02.558 align:start position:0%
cold does that include bed bugs and
 
04:49:05.190 --> 04:49:05.200 align:start position:0%
lice that would be up to the family and
 
04:49:06.590 --> 04:49:06.600 align:start position:0%
the parents and the student who is
 
04:49:09.110 --> 04:49:09.120 align:start position:0%
applying for efas under this
 
04:49:11.670 --> 04:49:11.680 align:start position:0%
hardship so if they are if they are a
 
04:49:13.788 --> 04:49:13.798 align:start position:0%
family and they are worried about
 
04:49:16.390 --> 04:49:16.400 align:start position:0%
getting lice or getting a common disease
 
04:49:18.510 --> 04:49:18.520 align:start position:0%
as outlined in the bill they would be
 
04:49:20.270 --> 04:49:20.280 align:start position:0%
able to qualify for educational Freedom
 
04:49:21.910 --> 04:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
accounts under this
 
04:49:24.510 --> 04:49:24.520 align:start position:0%
legislation just a quick followup but
 
04:49:26.390 --> 04:49:26.400 align:start position:0%
they're not
 
04:49:28.670 --> 04:49:28.680 align:start position:0%
diseases I'm I was just using your own
 
04:49:30.990 --> 04:49:31.000 align:start position:0%
words in your question but if if they
 
04:49:33.230 --> 04:49:33.240 align:start position:0%
are if they are worried about diseases
 
04:49:35.070 --> 04:49:35.080 align:start position:0%
such as Co 19 the common cold the
 
04:49:37.590 --> 04:49:37.600 align:start position:0%
seasonal flu pneumonia or other similar
 
04:49:39.350 --> 04:49:39.360 align:start position:0%
diseases if they're worried about
 
04:49:41.350 --> 04:49:41.360 align:start position:0%
catching that within the school system
 
04:49:43.270 --> 04:49:43.280 align:start position:0%
they would be free to qual uh to apply
 
04:49:45.628 --> 04:49:45.638 align:start position:0%
to qualify for educational Freedom
 
04:49:47.910 --> 04:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
accounts under this
 
04:49:52.230 --> 04:49:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:55.070 --> 04:49:55.080 align:start position:0%
you thank you for taking my question
 
04:49:57.868 --> 04:49:57.878 align:start position:0%
course so would it be correct to Simply
 
04:50:01.430 --> 04:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
say that this bill Endeavors to provide
 
04:50:03.868 --> 04:50:03.878 align:start position:0%
rationale by which any family could
 
04:50:06.110 --> 04:50:06.120 align:start position:0%
qualify their student for an
 
04:50:08.990 --> 04:50:09.000 align:start position:0%
EFA I mean if the family attests to one
 
04:50:11.110 --> 04:50:11.120 align:start position:0%
of these categories they would qualify
 
04:50:12.390 --> 04:50:12.400 align:start position:0%
under this bill but they would be
 
04:50:13.788 --> 04:50:13.798 align:start position:0%
required to attest to one of the
 
04:50:18.910 --> 04:50:18.920 align:start position:0%
categories in the bill follow yes so I'm
 
04:50:20.868 --> 04:50:20.878 align:start position:0%
pretty sure no one actually wants one of
 
04:50:22.750 --> 04:50:22.760 align:start position:0%
those contagious
 
04:50:25.788 --> 04:50:25.798 align:start position:0%
diseases no one wants to be bullied I'm
 
04:50:27.910 --> 04:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
not going to read off the whole
 
04:50:30.548 --> 04:50:30.558 align:start position:0%
list it sounds like everyone qualifies
 
04:50:32.990 --> 04:50:33.000 align:start position:0%
well it's it's not anybody who is afraid
 
04:50:34.670 --> 04:50:34.680 align:start position:0%
of being bullied it's those students who
 
04:50:36.470 --> 04:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
are persistently bullied which is
 
04:50:38.948 --> 04:50:38.958 align:start position:0%
already defined in statute um as for the
 
04:50:41.430 --> 04:50:41.440 align:start position:0%
diseases I I'm not aware of many
 
04:50:43.990 --> 04:50:44.000 align:start position:0%
families who would be so concerned of
 
04:50:45.430 --> 04:50:45.440 align:start position:0%
catching the diseases that they would
 
04:50:47.548 --> 04:50:47.558 align:start position:0%
pull their students from public school
 
04:50:49.830 --> 04:50:49.840 align:start position:0%
but I have seen remarks on Twitter uh
 
04:50:51.190 --> 04:50:51.200 align:start position:0%
from some of our colleagues here in the
 
04:50:53.110 --> 04:50:53.120 align:start position:0%
house worried about students going back
 
04:50:55.590 --> 04:50:55.600 align:start position:0%
to school uh while diseases are running
 
04:50:57.590 --> 04:50:57.600 align:start position:0%
rampant and so if those individual
 
04:51:00.150 --> 04:51:00.160 align:start position:0%
families do fear uh the potential
 
04:51:01.830 --> 04:51:01.840 align:start position:0%
catching and spread of diseases at
 
04:51:03.430 --> 04:51:03.440 align:start position:0%
Public Schools I wanted to make sure
 
04:51:05.070 --> 04:51:05.080 align:start position:0%
that they were qual they were eligible
 
04:51:07.548 --> 04:51:07.558 align:start position:0%
for educational Freedom under this
 
04:51:11.030 --> 04:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
bill I have an unrelated question me I
 
04:51:12.788 --> 04:51:12.798 align:start position:0%
have a question that's a different line
 
04:51:12.798 --> 04:51:15.990 align:start position:0%
have a question that's a different line
may

04:51:15.990 --> 04:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:18.510 --> 04:51:18.520 align:start position:0%
I thank you Mr speaker thank you for
 
04:51:20.548 --> 04:51:20.558 align:start position:0%
taking my question so in essence I'm
 
04:51:22.430 --> 04:51:22.440 align:start position:0%
following representative bbon and
 
04:51:26.110 --> 04:51:26.120 align:start position:0%
representative Damon This truly is um it
 
04:51:28.230 --> 04:51:28.240 align:start position:0%
seems like anyway or I guess I should
 
04:51:30.708 --> 04:51:30.718 align:start position:0%
ask you the universal eligibility
 
04:51:33.270 --> 04:51:33.280 align:start position:0%
because if I don't qualify fin if I
 
04:51:34.350 --> 04:51:34.360 align:start position:0%
don't qualif
 
04:51:36.510 --> 04:51:36.520 align:start position:0%
financially I just and I really want to
 
04:51:39.150 --> 04:51:39.160 align:start position:0%
get in this program I just say I'm I
 
04:51:41.670 --> 04:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
don't want to get the flu I'm in so it
 
04:51:43.548 --> 04:51:43.558 align:start position:0%
does seem like a
 
04:51:45.990 --> 04:51:46.000 align:start position:0%
universal so so this this bill
 
04:51:48.470 --> 04:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
establishes nine categories that a
 
04:51:50.670 --> 04:51:50.680 align:start position:0%
parent has to attest to in order to get
 
04:51:52.390 --> 04:51:52.400 align:start position:0%
their student qualified for educational
 
04:51:54.548 --> 04:51:54.558 align:start position:0%
Freedom accounts so if they if they
 
04:51:56.430 --> 04:51:56.440 align:start position:0%
qualify for one of these categories they
 
04:52:00.030 --> 04:52:00.040 align:start position:0%
would what just one yep yeah so thank
 
04:52:04.150 --> 04:52:04.160 align:start position:0%
you back to cor Damon did you I do and
 
04:52:07.750 --> 04:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
thank you so relative to the category
 
04:52:11.830 --> 04:52:11.840 align:start position:0%
line 22 regarding P pass
 
04:52:15.750 --> 04:52:15.760 align:start position:0%
yep if the district drinking water
 
04:52:19.390 --> 04:52:19.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:22.910 --> 04:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
standards I would expect that it is
 
04:52:25.548 --> 04:52:25.558 align:start position:0%
highly likely that almost everywhere
 
04:52:28.110 --> 04:52:28.120 align:start position:0%
else in the community also exceeds the P
 
04:52:29.830 --> 04:52:29.840 align:start position:0%
pass drinking water
 
04:52:33.350 --> 04:52:33.360 align:start position:0%
standards so having the student change
 
04:52:35.470 --> 04:52:35.480 align:start position:0%
where they get educated doesn't protect
 
04:52:38.110 --> 04:52:38.120 align:start position:0%
them from that and there's nothing
 
04:52:38.120 --> 04:52:39.510 align:start position:0%
them from that and there's nothing
stating

04:52:39.510 --> 04:52:39.520 align:start position:0%
stating
 
04:52:42.070 --> 04:52:42.080 align:start position:0%
here that they need to go to an
 
04:52:44.470 --> 04:52:44.480 align:start position:0%
educational setting where the P pass
 
04:52:47.110 --> 04:52:47.120 align:start position:0%
standards are not exceeded but it would
 
04:52:49.310 --> 04:52:49.320 align:start position:0%
give the family flexibility to send
 
04:52:51.590 --> 04:52:51.600 align:start position:0%
their students outside of that zip code
 
04:52:53.390 --> 04:52:53.400 align:start position:0%
outside of that area of contamination
 
04:52:55.470 --> 04:52:55.480 align:start position:0%
and really just empower the family to
 
04:52:56.910 --> 04:52:56.920 align:start position:0%
make the educational decision and the
 
04:52:59.310 --> 04:52:59.320 align:start position:0%
lifestyle decision that works best for
 
04:52:59.320 --> 04:53:01.390 align:start position:0%
lifestyle decision that works best for
them

04:53:01.390 --> 04:53:01.400 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:53:05.270 --> 04:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
follow thank you so when legislation
 
04:53:07.070 --> 04:53:07.080 align:start position:0%
comes forward to address P passing
 
04:53:08.548 --> 04:53:08.558 align:start position:0%
communities I hope we'll have your
 
04:53:10.868 --> 04:53:10.878 align:start position:0%
support for addressing it ABS I've as a
 
04:53:12.070 --> 04:53:12.080 align:start position:0%
member of the finance committee have
 
04:53:13.990 --> 04:53:14.000 align:start position:0%
supported many efforts to clear our
 
04:53:15.910 --> 04:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
communities of p and would absolutely
 
04:53:21.788 --> 04:53:21.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:25.470 --> 04:53:25.480 align:start position:0%
course are anys
 
04:53:27.390 --> 04:53:27.400 align:start position:0%
represented represent
 
04:53:29.390 --> 04:53:29.400 align:start position:0%
belg thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:53:32.350 --> 04:53:32.360 align:start position:0%
gra s for bringing this so This
 
04:53:34.948 --> 04:53:34.958 align:start position:0%
references Co and uh has a line about
 
04:53:38.830 --> 04:53:38.840 align:start position:0%
the infectious diseases and whatnot now
 
04:53:42.350 --> 04:53:42.360 align:start position:0%
um the New Hampshire Department of um
 
04:53:44.190 --> 04:53:44.200 align:start position:0%
public health is still recommending for
 
04:53:46.628 --> 04:53:46.638 align:start position:0%
children that they receive the covid-19
 
04:53:50.510 --> 04:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
vaccine um now that's despite the fact
 
04:53:52.070 --> 04:53:52.080 align:start position:0%
that I'm I'm not so sure that children
 
04:53:53.948 --> 04:53:53.958 align:start position:0%
are are actually affected by covid-19
 
04:53:55.708 --> 04:53:55.718 align:start position:0%
usually but one of the things
 
04:53:58.030 --> 04:53:58.040 align:start position:0%
epidemiologists said was that they have
 
04:53:59.390 --> 04:53:59.400 align:start position:0%
to receive the vaccine in order that
 
04:54:01.470 --> 04:54:01.480 align:start position:0%
they don't spread it to older people who
 
04:54:03.868 --> 04:54:03.878 align:start position:0%
are affected so along that same L of
 
04:54:06.708 --> 04:54:06.718 align:start position:0%
thought would this then Empower uh
 
04:54:09.390 --> 04:54:09.400 align:start position:0%
parents maybe one of them is autoimmune
 
04:54:11.868 --> 04:54:11.878 align:start position:0%
comp or immune compromised to remove a
 
04:54:13.510 --> 04:54:13.520 align:start position:0%
child if they're fearful that they might
 
04:54:14.470 --> 04:54:14.480 align:start position:0%
catch something at school that could
 
04:54:16.190 --> 04:54:16.200 align:start position:0%
come home and kill them absolutely thank
 
04:54:17.070 --> 04:54:17.080 align:start position:0%
you very much for the question
 
04:54:18.310 --> 04:54:18.320 align:start position:0%
representative Bel and that's really to
 
04:54:20.628 --> 04:54:20.638 align:start position:0%
the point of the of why including that
 
04:54:22.110 --> 04:54:22.120 align:start position:0%
provision in there if there is a family
 
04:54:23.948 --> 04:54:23.958 align:start position:0%
at risk uh as you mentioned with
 
04:54:26.390 --> 04:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
autoimmune disorder or what whatever
 
04:54:28.510 --> 04:54:28.520 align:start position:0%
reason that they are fearful of catching
 
04:54:30.708 --> 04:54:30.718 align:start position:0%
an infectious disease like covid or or
 
04:54:32.910 --> 04:54:32.920 align:start position:0%
something similar uh this would be able
 
04:54:35.548 --> 04:54:35.558 align:start position:0%
to to to protect that family um and make
 
04:54:38.948 --> 04:54:38.958 align:start position:0%
it so that we won't see lethal
 
04:54:42.868 --> 04:54:42.878 align:start position:0%
cases further question committee
 
04:54:45.548 --> 04:54:45.558 align:start position:0%
repent thank you Mr Mr chair and thank
 
04:54:47.310 --> 04:54:47.320 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question so would you
 
04:54:50.030 --> 04:54:50.040 align:start position:0%
say that the co the one that are going
 
04:54:52.390 --> 04:54:52.400 align:start position:0%
to use that one let's say the co that
 
04:54:54.150 --> 04:54:54.160 align:start position:0%
they're not going to go to another
 
04:54:55.110 --> 04:54:55.120 align:start position:0%
private school because there are a lot
 
04:54:56.670 --> 04:54:56.680 align:start position:0%
of kids there too that they would likely
 
04:54:59.110 --> 04:54:59.120 align:start position:0%
homeschool at that point I I certainly
 
04:55:01.030 --> 04:55:01.040 align:start position:0%
don't want to speak for the family and
 
04:55:02.510 --> 04:55:02.520 align:start position:0%
there may be educational pod
 
04:55:05.270 --> 04:55:05.280 align:start position:0%
opportunities a ailable uh that would
 
04:55:07.110 --> 04:55:07.120 align:start position:0%
provide a little bit more distancing or
 
04:55:08.470 --> 04:55:08.480 align:start position:0%
different Health standards that might
 
04:55:11.070 --> 04:55:11.080 align:start position:0%
align with the family's values um they
 
04:55:12.910 --> 04:55:12.920 align:start position:0%
could potentially use it to to expand
 
04:55:15.030 --> 04:55:15.040 align:start position:0%
homeschooling options or their ability
 
04:55:17.910 --> 04:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
to homeschool or they can find a school
 
04:55:20.350 --> 04:55:20.360 align:start position:0%
option that works for them so that I
 
04:55:22.868 --> 04:55:22.878 align:start position:0%
wouldn't I wouldn't try to theorize what
 
04:55:25.510 --> 04:55:25.520 align:start position:0%
the family would use it for thank
 
04:55:28.750 --> 04:55:28.760 align:start position:0%
you I don't see any further
 
04:55:31.590 --> 04:55:31.600 align:start position:0%
hands oh
 
04:55:34.190 --> 04:55:34.200 align:start position:0%
hand thank you very much thank you very
 
04:55:41.030 --> 04:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:44.230 --> 04:55:44.240 align:start position:0%
all thank you Mr chair and seam members
 
04:55:45.788 --> 04:55:45.798 align:start position:0%
of the House Education committee for the
 
04:55:47.310 --> 04:55:47.320 align:start position:0%
record my name is Joe Alexander I
 
04:55:49.070 --> 04:55:49.080 align:start position:0%
represent the town of
 
04:55:52.030 --> 04:55:52.040 align:start position:0%
gtown so actually last Thanksgiving I
 
04:55:54.310 --> 04:55:54.320 align:start position:0%
just celebrated my 10-year High School
 
04:55:56.430 --> 04:55:56.440 align:start position:0%
reunion and I went to conquered high
 
04:55:59.670 --> 04:55:59.680 align:start position:0%
school I'm still yes I'm 29y old baby so
 
04:56:01.708 --> 04:56:01.718 align:start position:0%
um and I went to conquered high school
 
04:56:03.670 --> 04:56:03.680 align:start position:0%
and I'm I'm kind of speaking from heart
 
04:56:06.350 --> 04:56:06.360 align:start position:0%
here because most of you know that today
 
04:56:09.030 --> 04:56:09.040 align:start position:0%
I identify as an
 
04:56:12.310 --> 04:56:12.320 align:start position:0%
lgbtq individual I'm a 29-year-old man I
 
04:56:16.030 --> 04:56:16.040 align:start position:0%
live with another man um I guess from my
 
04:56:17.750 --> 04:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
experience and why I believe that this
 
04:56:20.110 --> 04:56:20.120 align:start position:0%
bill is needed is because in high school
 
04:56:22.910 --> 04:56:22.920 align:start position:0%
maybe I was not necessarily comfortable
 
04:56:25.470 --> 04:56:25.480 align:start position:0%
enough coming out and being my authentic
 
04:56:29.350 --> 04:56:29.360 align:start position:0%
self when I saw others in the schools
 
04:56:31.230 --> 04:56:31.240 align:start position:0%
being bullied for being their authentic
 
04:56:34.150 --> 04:56:34.160 align:start position:0%
self so in in that situation as somebody
 
04:56:36.150 --> 04:56:36.160 align:start position:0%
who identifies as a member of this
 
04:56:37.510 --> 04:56:37.520 align:start position:0%
community I think it's really important
 
04:56:39.030 --> 04:56:39.040 align:start position:0%
that we provide students and families
 
04:56:41.868 --> 04:56:41.878 align:start position:0%
options um even students that identify
 
04:56:44.910 --> 04:56:44.920 align:start position:0%
as lgbtq so um I'm really just here to
 
04:56:46.350 --> 04:56:46.360 align:start position:0%
to say that there's countless stories
 
04:56:48.788 --> 04:56:48.798 align:start position:0%
like mine um we you know public schools
 
04:56:50.868 --> 04:56:50.878 align:start position:0%
are great for most people but not
 
04:56:52.990 --> 04:56:53.000 align:start position:0%
everyone and I think in a situation
 
04:56:55.708 --> 04:56:55.718 align:start position:0%
where you identify in this way or you're
 
04:56:58.470 --> 04:56:58.480 align:start position:0%
not really sure yet and you see others
 
04:57:00.708 --> 04:57:00.718 align:start position:0%
that look like you or act like you being
 
04:57:02.628 --> 04:57:02.638 align:start position:0%
bullied um you should have that
 
04:57:04.708 --> 04:57:04.718 align:start position:0%
opportunity to use an education Freedom
 
04:57:07.390 --> 04:57:07.400 align:start position:0%
account and go somewhere that has
 
04:57:10.430 --> 04:57:10.440 align:start position:0%
a somewhere that better fits your needs
 
04:57:12.230 --> 04:57:12.240 align:start position:0%
so with that I'm happy to take questions
 
04:57:13.708 --> 04:57:13.718 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative are
 
04:57:15.510 --> 04:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
there questions for representative
 
04:57:17.470 --> 04:57:17.480 align:start position:0%
Alexander yes representative cordelli
 
04:57:18.990 --> 04:57:19.000 align:start position:0%
thank you uh thank you representative
 
04:57:21.510 --> 04:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
alexand for being here um I'm just
 
04:57:24.110 --> 04:57:24.120 align:start position:0%
looking for the difference between um I
 
04:57:25.230 --> 04:57:25.240 align:start position:0%
don't know if you have the bill in front
 
04:57:29.190 --> 04:57:29.200 align:start position:0%
of you uh e and i in that one it seems
 
04:57:31.310 --> 04:57:31.320 align:start position:0%
like we're talking about the
 
04:57:34.270 --> 04:57:34.280 align:start position:0%
25th bottom 25th percentile and the
 
04:57:36.548 --> 04:57:36.558 align:start position:0%
other one we're talking about the bottom
 
04:57:39.868 --> 04:57:39.878 align:start position:0%
10% 10 um 10th
 
04:57:42.590 --> 04:57:42.600 align:start position:0%
percentile and I'm just wondering if you
 
04:57:44.510 --> 04:57:44.520 align:start position:0%
know maybe one of those could be
 
04:57:47.310 --> 04:57:47.320 align:start position:0%
eliminated well I'm I'm again you the
 
04:57:50.070 --> 04:57:50.080 align:start position:0%
committee now has control over the bill
 
04:57:52.310 --> 04:57:52.320 align:start position:0%
um I would say that if I'm looking
 
04:57:54.110 --> 04:57:54.120 align:start position:0%
briefly at this geographical boundaries
 
04:57:58.230 --> 04:57:58.240 align:start position:0%
of a school is different from um it the
 
04:58:00.430 --> 04:58:00.440 align:start position:0%
state standardized testing so I mean if
 
04:58:02.910 --> 04:58:02.920 align:start position:0%
you look at the gtown school district
 
04:58:05.030 --> 04:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
it's goof toown and New Boston so that
 
04:58:06.310 --> 04:58:06.320 align:start position:0%
would what I would interpret
 
04:58:08.750 --> 04:58:08.760 align:start position:0%
geographical boundaries and then the
 
04:58:09.990 --> 04:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
state scores are going to be different
 
04:58:12.510 --> 04:58:12.520 align:start position:0%
from the Goof toown New Boston score so
 
04:58:15.510 --> 04:58:15.520 align:start position:0%
that's how I would answer that perhaps
 
04:58:16.910 --> 04:58:16.920 align:start position:0%
uh there might be an
 
04:58:19.708 --> 04:58:19.718 align:start position:0%
answer thank you Mr chairman uh and
 
04:58:21.350 --> 04:58:21.360 align:start position:0%
that's a great op observation
 
04:58:23.910 --> 04:58:23.920 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli section e is for
 
04:58:25.430 --> 04:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
the students who have tested in the
 
04:58:28.670 --> 04:58:28.680 align:start position:0%
bottom 25th percentile and section I is
 
04:58:30.708 --> 04:58:30.718 align:start position:0%
if the school district is in the bottom
 
04:58:34.350 --> 04:58:34.360 align:start position:0%
10% okay so it's it's the student is is
 
04:58:37.910 --> 04:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
UN if yeah student versus district and
 
04:58:39.470 --> 04:58:39.480 align:start position:0%
that's why we're both named Joe so he
 
04:58:41.070 --> 04:58:41.080 align:start position:0%
can help if we need
 
04:58:44.590 --> 04:58:44.600 align:start position:0%
it any questions for representative Alex
 
04:58:46.788 --> 04:58:46.798 align:start position:0%
yes representative Cornell thank you and
 
04:58:48.788 --> 04:58:48.798 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um it
 
04:58:51.190 --> 04:58:51.200 align:start position:0%
says a resident of the state who is
 
04:58:52.910 --> 04:58:52.920 align:start position:0%
eligible to enroll in a public
 
04:58:55.150 --> 04:58:55.160 align:start position:0%
elementary or secondary school so I'm
 
04:58:57.110 --> 04:58:57.120 align:start position:0%
assuming that these are students who are
 
04:59:01.070 --> 04:59:01.080 align:start position:0%
in public schools now and want to leave
 
04:59:03.310 --> 04:59:03.320 align:start position:0%
and get an EFA not students who are
 
04:59:08.310 --> 04:59:08.320 align:start position:0%
already in a private parochial whatever
 
04:59:08.320 --> 04:59:10.830 align:start position:0%
already in a private parochial whatever
school

04:59:10.830 --> 04:59:10.840 align:start position:0%
school
 
04:59:14.708 --> 04:59:14.718 align:start position:0%
and want to start getting the EFA like a
 
04:59:16.670 --> 04:59:16.680 align:start position:0%
student who identifies as lesbian
 
04:59:20.190 --> 04:59:20.200 align:start position:0%
bisexual gay and they're in a private
 
04:59:23.708 --> 04:59:23.718 align:start position:0%
school but they are eligible to enroll
 
04:59:25.708 --> 04:59:25.718 align:start position:0%
can they get the money yes I mean that's
 
04:59:26.830 --> 04:59:26.840 align:start position:0%
the way I read the definition of
 
04:59:28.390 --> 04:59:28.400 align:start position:0%
Eligibility so they're already eligible
 
04:59:30.708 --> 04:59:30.718 align:start position:0%
to receive that okay so but I'm talking
 
04:59:33.110 --> 04:59:33.120 align:start position:0%
about my experience personally as a I
 
04:59:36.310 --> 04:59:36.320 align:start position:0%
think you're a sponsor so I'm ask so I'm
 
04:59:38.750 --> 04:59:38.760 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering if if it's students
 
04:59:40.110 --> 04:59:40.120 align:start position:0%
who are in a public school and they're
 
04:59:41.830 --> 04:59:41.840 align:start position:0%
going to leave because of one of these
 
04:59:44.708 --> 04:59:44.718 align:start position:0%
reasons or they're in a private school
 
04:59:47.390 --> 04:59:47.400 align:start position:0%
and they have seen this and they say oh
 
04:59:49.830 --> 04:59:49.840 align:start position:0%
that's me and then they ask for the EFA
 
04:59:51.270 --> 04:59:51.280 align:start position:0%
even though they aren't
 
04:59:53.990 --> 04:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
350% below property level will they
 
04:59:55.990 --> 04:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
qualify to get this money I mean there
 
04:59:57.750 --> 04:59:57.760 align:start position:0%
could be under this legislation there's
 
04:59:59.270 --> 04:59:59.280 align:start position:0%
a number of reasons why students would
 
05:00:01.430 --> 05:00:01.440 align:start position:0%
qualify so I would say in this situation
 
05:00:02.990 --> 05:00:03.000 align:start position:0%
the way I mean that's the way I read
 
05:00:04.868 --> 05:00:04.878 align:start position:0%
elig so they don't have to be in the
 
05:00:04.878 --> 05:00:05.868 align:start position:0%
elig so they don't have to be in the
public

05:00:05.868 --> 05:00:05.878 align:start position:0%
public
 
05:00:07.470 --> 05:00:07.480 align:start position:0%
school I
 
05:00:10.390 --> 05:00:10.400 align:start position:0%
mean I that's how I read the bill okay
 
05:00:14.628 --> 05:00:14.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:19.788 --> 05:00:19.798 align:start position:0%
questions not seeing any represent
 
05:00:22.310 --> 05:00:22.320 align:start position:0%
Damon sorry Mr chair I was trying to
 
05:00:24.510 --> 05:00:24.520 align:start position:0%
figure out how to frame this question
 
05:00:25.510 --> 05:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
05:00:25.520 --> 05:00:27.470 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
representative

05:00:27.470 --> 05:00:27.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:00:29.430 --> 05:00:29.440 align:start position:0%
Alexander I'm wondering if you could
 
05:00:29.440 --> 05:00:31.030 align:start position:0%
Alexander I'm wondering if you could
comment

05:00:31.030 --> 05:00:31.040 align:start position:0%
comment
 
05:00:33.470 --> 05:00:33.480 align:start position:0%
about ways in which
 
05:00:38.150 --> 05:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
any school environment public or
 
05:00:41.788 --> 05:00:41.798 align:start position:0%
otherwise could be a safer more
 
05:00:44.390 --> 05:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
appropriate place for folks on the
 
05:00:47.150 --> 05:00:47.160 align:start position:0%
lgbtq identification or anyone else who
 
05:00:50.150 --> 05:00:50.160 align:start position:0%
might be bullied yeah and and I hate to
 
05:00:51.868 --> 05:00:51.878 align:start position:0%
speak for the entire Community because I
 
05:00:53.910 --> 05:00:53.920 align:start position:0%
know others like to speak for me in the
 
05:00:56.430 --> 05:00:56.440 align:start position:0%
community so I for that reason won't
 
05:00:57.830 --> 05:00:57.840 align:start position:0%
really speak for the whole Community but
 
05:00:59.150 --> 05:00:59.160 align:start position:0%
I will say from my own personal
 
05:01:02.910 --> 05:01:02.920 align:start position:0%
experience that um seeing others bullied
 
05:01:04.788 --> 05:01:04.798 align:start position:0%
made me uncomfortable being authentic in
 
05:01:06.948 --> 05:01:06.958 align:start position:0%
my own skin and my own self so for that
 
05:01:09.310 --> 05:01:09.320 align:start position:0%
reason I could see why this bill is
 
05:01:12.030 --> 05:01:12.040 align:start position:0%
needed thank you very much are there
 
05:01:14.070 --> 05:01:14.080 align:start position:0%
further questions not seeing any thank
 
05:01:15.830 --> 05:01:15.840 align:start position:0%
you very much
 
05:01:25.150 --> 05:01:25.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:27.590 --> 05:01:27.600 align:start position:0%
Wilkey to the speaker
 
05:01:31.830 --> 05:01:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:31.840 --> 05:01:34.708 align:start position:0%
 
welcome

05:01:34.708 --> 05:01:34.718 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
05:01:37.830 --> 05:01:37.840 align:start position:0%
um good afternoon the red button or the
 
05:01:40.470 --> 05:01:40.480 align:start position:0%
you know there you go it's red thank you
 
05:01:42.628 --> 05:01:42.638 align:start position:0%
I'm Mary wilky and um I live in conquer
 
05:01:44.910 --> 05:01:44.920 align:start position:0%
I'm a retired public school teacher and
 
05:01:46.470 --> 05:01:46.480 align:start position:0%
I'm breaking a record I've never spoken
 
05:01:48.788 --> 05:01:48.798 align:start position:0%
twice in the same day so this will be my
 
05:01:51.750 --> 05:01:51.760 align:start position:0%
last though I promise um I'm here to
 
05:01:56.230 --> 05:01:56.240 align:start position:0%
oppose HB 1561 and um I was interested
 
05:01:58.548 --> 05:01:58.558 align:start position:0%
in hearing representative Sweeny I I
 
05:01:59.868 --> 05:01:59.878 align:start position:0%
kind of related to a lot of what he was
 
05:02:02.110 --> 05:02:02.120 align:start position:0%
saying because I also went to a very
 
05:02:04.510 --> 05:02:04.520 align:start position:0%
good public school um that I think had
 
05:02:05.830 --> 05:02:05.840 align:start position:0%
more resources than a lot of other
 
05:02:08.190 --> 05:02:08.200 align:start position:0%
schools um and one thing he said and I
 
05:02:09.628 --> 05:02:09.638 align:start position:0%
sorry he left because I'm trying to
 
05:02:11.390 --> 05:02:11.400 align:start position:0%
quote him as accurately as I can I
 
05:02:13.548 --> 05:02:13.558 align:start position:0%
believe he said that he had wonderful
 
05:02:14.910 --> 05:02:14.920 align:start position:0%
experience there they helped him with
 
05:02:17.070 --> 05:02:17.080 align:start position:0%
his speech disorder and all that uh and
 
05:02:19.110 --> 05:02:19.120 align:start position:0%
then he I believe said but I recognize
 
05:02:21.350 --> 05:02:21.360 align:start position:0%
that Salem as a property rich town is
 
05:02:22.910 --> 05:02:22.920 align:start position:0%
not representative of all school
 
05:02:25.110 --> 05:02:25.120 align:start position:0%
districts and that's kind of the point
 
05:02:27.430 --> 05:02:27.440 align:start position:0%
that came up this morning that uh one
 
05:02:29.430 --> 05:02:29.440 align:start position:0%
way you could deal with that is take out
 
05:02:32.310 --> 05:02:32.320 align:start position:0%
a handful of kids from a property poor
 
05:02:34.070 --> 05:02:34.080 align:start position:0%
District and give them what they need
 
05:02:36.030 --> 05:02:36.040 align:start position:0%
and leave all the rest behind or you
 
05:02:38.910 --> 05:02:38.920 align:start position:0%
could Elevate so that all the kids all
 
05:02:41.150 --> 05:02:41.160 align:start position:0%
around the state have uh an equal
 
05:02:43.070 --> 05:02:43.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity which is what clemont's
 
05:02:47.788 --> 05:02:47.798 align:start position:0%
about um I also I I also had kind of
 
05:02:50.110 --> 05:02:50.120 align:start position:0%
noticed the issue that um representative
 
05:02:53.230 --> 05:02:53.240 align:start position:0%
Cornell raised and I think you know so
 
05:02:55.830 --> 05:02:55.840 align:start position:0%
far uh something like 75% of the
 
05:02:58.230 --> 05:02:58.240 align:start position:0%
students who have taken efas have
 
05:03:00.868 --> 05:03:00.878 align:start position:0%
already been in private or home school
 
05:03:04.670 --> 05:03:04.680 align:start position:0%
and so if so this as I read this statute
 
05:03:07.070 --> 05:03:07.080 align:start position:0%
it means if there's um a student with an
 
05:03:09.948 --> 05:03:09.958 align:start position:0%
eating disorder at St Paul's School
 
05:03:12.230 --> 05:03:12.240 align:start position:0%
who's getting whose parents can afford
 
05:03:14.990 --> 05:03:15.000 align:start position:0%
to pay uh for the
 
05:03:17.548 --> 05:03:17.558 align:start position:0%
tuition she or he is going to get
 
05:03:19.390 --> 05:03:19.400 align:start position:0%
another $5,000 from the state and I
 
05:03:22.708 --> 05:03:22.718 align:start position:0%
don't understand the rationale for that
 
05:03:24.948 --> 05:03:24.958 align:start position:0%
if they can get and I thought well maybe
 
05:03:26.390 --> 05:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
the rationale is then they can if they
 
05:03:30.510 --> 05:03:30.520 align:start position:0%
need some extra help with I therapy or
 
05:03:31.670 --> 05:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
something maybe they could use the
 
05:03:33.590 --> 05:03:33.600 align:start position:0%
$5,000 that I thought well then why not
 
05:03:36.670 --> 05:03:36.680 align:start position:0%
just give th $1,000 to every child in a
 
05:03:39.070 --> 05:03:39.080 align:start position:0%
public school who's who fits in who has
 
05:03:41.350 --> 05:03:41.360 align:start position:0%
an eating disorder and let them get
 
05:03:43.070 --> 05:03:43.080 align:start position:0%
therapy too I don't I don't understand
 
05:03:46.350 --> 05:03:46.360 align:start position:0%
the rationale um you could
 
05:03:50.070 --> 05:03:50.080 align:start position:0%
um let's see
 
05:03:53.510 --> 05:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
um and I guess
 
05:03:56.868 --> 05:03:56.878 align:start position:0%
uh the other thing that I guess a
 
05:04:00.270 --> 05:04:00.280 align:start position:0%
broader point is and it's all connected
 
05:04:03.868 --> 05:04:03.878 align:start position:0%
but if I do I really I felt that
 
05:04:05.750 --> 05:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
certainly the sponsors seem very sincere
 
05:04:07.390 --> 05:04:07.400 align:start position:0%
and they're concerned about students who
 
05:04:10.190 --> 05:04:10.200 align:start position:0%
might have special issues or things that
 
05:04:11.948 --> 05:04:11.958 align:start position:0%
make them feel more vulnerable whatever
 
05:04:14.510 --> 05:04:14.520 align:start position:0%
it is but if you're concerned about
 
05:04:16.788 --> 05:04:16.798 align:start position:0%
these categories of children and so
 
05:04:18.350 --> 05:04:18.360 align:start position:0%
concerned that you're willing to push a
 
05:04:21.868 --> 05:04:21.878 align:start position:0%
bill that has no cap in terms of budget
 
05:04:25.190 --> 05:04:25.200 align:start position:0%
no no determined costs then what about
 
05:04:27.430 --> 05:04:27.440 align:start position:0%
the students who won't be able to take
 
05:04:29.628 --> 05:04:29.638 align:start position:0%
advantage of it because we all know
 
05:04:32.590 --> 05:04:32.600 align:start position:0%
there are students who um might be
 
05:04:34.430 --> 05:04:34.440 align:start position:0%
eligible but their parents can't afford
 
05:04:36.510 --> 05:04:36.520 align:start position:0%
to make up the difference between the
 
05:04:40.628 --> 05:04:40.638 align:start position:0%
tuition and and what the EFA pays for or
 
05:04:41.830 --> 05:04:41.840 align:start position:0%
they parents can't provide the
 
05:04:43.350 --> 05:04:43.360 align:start position:0%
transportation or maybe there's nothing
 
05:04:45.708 --> 05:04:45.718 align:start position:0%
near there where they live so if you
 
05:04:48.510 --> 05:04:48.520 align:start position:0%
have elevated levels of pfas in your
 
05:04:50.708 --> 05:04:50.718 align:start position:0%
water at your school and you're saying
 
05:04:52.910 --> 05:04:52.920 align:start position:0%
well give kids a chance to go somewhere
 
05:04:54.670 --> 05:04:54.680 align:start position:0%
else great and then you're just going to
 
05:04:55.830 --> 05:04:55.840 align:start position:0%
leave the other ones there drinking the
 
05:04:58.788 --> 05:04:58.798 align:start position:0%
bad water it just seems inhumane to me
 
05:05:01.670 --> 05:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
if you really think I don't mean you if
 
05:05:04.190 --> 05:05:04.200 align:start position:0%
if the sponsors of the bill really feel
 
05:05:06.230 --> 05:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
that these children are at risk then
 
05:05:07.590 --> 05:05:07.600 align:start position:0%
what about the ones that are not going
 
05:05:11.190 --> 05:05:11.200 align:start position:0%
to be able to take the EFA what's going
 
05:05:13.948 --> 05:05:13.958 align:start position:0%
to happen to them and it seems to me
 
05:05:16.350 --> 05:05:16.360 align:start position:0%
that well also I've noticed that there
 
05:05:18.030 --> 05:05:18.040 align:start position:0%
are quite a few of private schools that
 
05:05:21.350 --> 05:05:21.360 align:start position:0%
yes do not do refuse to take lgbtq
 
05:05:22.470 --> 05:05:22.480 align:start position:0%
students they put it right on their
 
05:05:24.310 --> 05:05:24.320 align:start position:0%
websites they refuse to take students
 
05:05:25.628 --> 05:05:25.638 align:start position:0%
who have certain uh learning
 
05:05:27.430 --> 05:05:27.440 align:start position:0%
disabilities um they certainly take
 
05:05:29.110 --> 05:05:29.120 align:start position:0%
refuse to take students of a different
 
05:05:30.670 --> 05:05:30.680 align:start position:0%
religion there are a lot of
 
05:05:33.230 --> 05:05:33.240 align:start position:0%
opportunities that are not available to
 
05:05:35.548 --> 05:05:35.558 align:start position:0%
um through this program to where the
 
05:05:38.590 --> 05:05:38.600 align:start position:0%
where people are closed out of
 
05:05:41.030 --> 05:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
um but it seems to me that in any
 
05:05:42.070 --> 05:05:42.080 align:start position:0%
situation you're going to have some
 
05:05:44.628 --> 05:05:44.638 align:start position:0%
students who need something extra or
 
05:05:47.150 --> 05:05:47.160 align:start position:0%
have some extra vulnerability or
 
05:05:49.990 --> 05:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
something and rather than identifying
 
05:05:52.070 --> 05:05:52.080 align:start position:0%
these categories and who do we think are
 
05:05:53.868 --> 05:05:53.878 align:start position:0%
at risk and give some of them money to
 
05:05:55.310 --> 05:05:55.320 align:start position:0%
leave their public school but leaving
 
05:05:56.948 --> 05:05:56.958 align:start position:0%
the rest of them behind and then sending
 
05:05:58.470 --> 05:05:58.480 align:start position:0%
a lot of money to private school kids
 
05:06:00.670 --> 05:06:00.680 align:start position:0%
who already are happy where they are
 
05:06:02.830 --> 05:06:02.840 align:start position:0%
whether they're in one of these Cate or
 
05:06:05.230 --> 05:06:05.240 align:start position:0%
not what if instead we had school a
 
05:06:07.030 --> 05:06:07.040 align:start position:0%
school system where we just gave all the
 
05:06:08.310 --> 05:06:08.320 align:start position:0%
students in these categories the
 
05:06:11.310 --> 05:06:11.320 align:start position:0%
supports they need including clean water
 
05:06:12.750 --> 05:06:12.760 align:start position:0%
and um what if we provided
 
05:06:14.590 --> 05:06:14.600 align:start position:0%
transportation and what if we made them
 
05:06:17.230 --> 05:06:17.240 align:start position:0%
open to everybody and free for everybody
 
05:06:19.430 --> 05:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
and everyone could participate and they
 
05:06:21.150 --> 05:06:21.160 align:start position:0%
all had an equal opportunity and that's
 
05:06:22.430 --> 05:06:22.440 align:start position:0%
what our public school system is
 
05:06:24.190 --> 05:06:24.200 align:start position:0%
supposed to be and I just would like to
 
05:06:26.708 --> 05:06:26.718 align:start position:0%
see all of our efforts and all of our
 
05:06:28.190 --> 05:06:28.200 align:start position:0%
extra money that seems to be lying
 
05:06:30.350 --> 05:06:30.360 align:start position:0%
around going to the public schools we're
 
05:06:32.750 --> 05:06:32.760 align:start position:0%
up to somewhere around 90% of our
 
05:06:35.070 --> 05:06:35.080 align:start position:0%
students go thank you thank you very
 
05:06:36.110 --> 05:06:36.120 align:start position:0%
much are there any questions
 
05:06:38.910 --> 05:06:38.920 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli thank you uh
 
05:06:42.548 --> 05:06:42.558 align:start position:0%
thank you for sticking around um uh just
 
05:06:44.868 --> 05:06:44.878 align:start position:0%
a question on one thing you said about
 
05:06:47.430 --> 05:06:47.440 align:start position:0%
are you aware of religious schools who
 
05:06:50.390 --> 05:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
don't accept someone from that same
 
05:06:52.670 --> 05:06:52.680 align:start position:0%
religion because I've I've had
 
05:06:54.270 --> 05:06:54.280 align:start position:0%
conversations with people in the
 
05:06:57.270 --> 05:06:57.280 align:start position:0%
Catholic schools community and um I've
 
05:07:00.390 --> 05:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
heard about um the non-catholic schools
 
05:07:02.708 --> 05:07:02.718 align:start position:0%
the great percentage of non-ath Catholic
 
05:07:04.390 --> 05:07:04.400 align:start position:0%
students who attend those Catholic
 
05:07:06.310 --> 05:07:06.320 align:start position:0%
schools and I was actually at a
 
05:07:09.628 --> 05:07:09.638 align:start position:0%
conference a few years ago and um a girl
 
05:07:12.830 --> 05:07:12.840 align:start position:0%
from Washington DC um her brother was in
 
05:07:14.670 --> 05:07:14.680 align:start position:0%
jail her parents said we got to get you
 
05:07:16.750 --> 05:07:16.760 align:start position:0%
out of this school because you're going
 
05:07:18.708 --> 05:07:18.718 align:start position:0%
to end up the same way he did she went
 
05:07:21.510 --> 05:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
to Catholic school she was not Catholic
 
05:07:22.990 --> 05:07:23.000 align:start position:0%
um when she talked to us she was
 
05:07:26.070 --> 05:07:26.080 align:start position:0%
studying for her PhD from Syracuse so
 
05:07:27.670 --> 05:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
I'm just wonder if you have any examples
 
05:07:29.590 --> 05:07:29.600 align:start position:0%
of that are you asking me if there are
 
05:07:32.070 --> 05:07:32.080 align:start position:0%
some religious schools that won't take a
 
05:07:34.230 --> 05:07:34.240 align:start position:0%
child from a different religion correct
 
05:07:37.948 --> 05:07:37.958 align:start position:0%
yes there are some um I I could I don't
 
05:07:39.310 --> 05:07:39.320 align:start position:0%
have the names in front of me I've seen
 
05:07:41.788 --> 05:07:41.798 align:start position:0%
on websites some that say you have to go
 
05:07:44.270 --> 05:07:44.280 align:start position:0%
to their particular Church to go not
 
05:07:47.110 --> 05:07:47.120 align:start position:0%
even just be their religion um there's I
 
05:07:49.628 --> 05:07:49.638 align:start position:0%
think a seventh day advocat well I don't
 
05:07:50.910 --> 05:07:50.920 align:start position:0%
actually I don't want to say without
 
05:07:52.510 --> 05:07:52.520 align:start position:0%
looking because I don't want to be
 
05:07:53.910 --> 05:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
misrepresenting some there are quite a
 
05:07:56.350 --> 05:07:56.360 align:start position:0%
few on their websites that do say you
 
05:07:58.390 --> 05:07:58.400 align:start position:0%
have to be this religion and there are
 
05:07:59.750 --> 05:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
others that don't others that say we
 
05:08:01.390 --> 05:08:01.400 align:start position:0%
take people of all religions so it's a
 
05:08:03.430 --> 05:08:03.440 align:start position:0%
mix I think
 
05:08:04.910 --> 05:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
are there further questions yes
 
05:08:06.868 --> 05:08:06.878 align:start position:0%
representative Bel beler and then
 
05:08:06.878 --> 05:08:07.910 align:start position:0%
representative Bel beler and then
representative

05:08:07.910 --> 05:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:08:09.910 --> 05:08:09.920 align:start position:0%
leus thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:08:12.590 --> 05:08:12.600 align:start position:0%
for the testimony um I'm going to try to
 
05:08:14.430 --> 05:08:14.440 align:start position:0%
get this quite right but I probably
 
05:08:17.350 --> 05:08:17.360 align:start position:0%
won't be perfect with it you you uh you
 
05:08:19.830 --> 05:08:19.840 align:start position:0%
testified that you would like to us to
 
05:08:24.430 --> 05:08:24.440 align:start position:0%
imagine a school um a public school that
 
05:08:28.830 --> 05:08:28.840 align:start position:0%
was providing clean water um providing
 
05:08:30.510 --> 05:08:30.520 align:start position:0%
all of the necessary things a student
 
05:08:32.670 --> 05:08:32.680 align:start position:0%
needs to achieve where students are all
 
05:08:36.350 --> 05:08:36.360 align:start position:0%
high Achievers and doing well and all of
 
05:08:38.230 --> 05:08:38.240 align:start position:0%
the uh special ed children are taken
 
05:08:40.590 --> 05:08:40.600 align:start position:0%
care of and all of their religions are
 
05:08:42.548 --> 05:08:42.558 align:start position:0%
respected and imagine if we could just
 
05:08:43.788 --> 05:08:43.798 align:start position:0%
do that
 
05:08:46.430 --> 05:08:46.440 align:start position:0%
all can you provide an example of any
 
05:08:51.150 --> 05:08:51.160 align:start position:0%
school in America that would fit those
 
05:08:53.628 --> 05:08:53.638 align:start position:0%
criteria um I didn't say all those I
 
05:08:56.190 --> 05:08:56.200 align:start position:0%
didn't say all those things um I didn't
 
05:08:58.590 --> 05:08:58.600 align:start position:0%
mention religion for instance um I think
 
05:09:00.230 --> 05:09:00.240 align:start position:0%
public schools are pretty careful to
 
05:09:01.788 --> 05:09:01.798 align:start position:0%
stay out of religion because there's so
 
05:09:05.110 --> 05:09:05.120 align:start position:0%
many religions and and non-religion um
 
05:09:06.750 --> 05:09:06.760 align:start position:0%
well I don't know the the school that
 
05:09:09.590 --> 05:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeny described seemed
 
05:09:12.430 --> 05:09:12.440 align:start position:0%
like a school that met a special need in
 
05:09:14.830 --> 05:09:14.840 align:start position:0%
a really great way and changed his life
 
05:09:16.390 --> 05:09:16.400 align:start position:0%
no I don't think there's any school that
 
05:09:18.510 --> 05:09:18.520 align:start position:0%
has worked for every single child but
 
05:09:20.230 --> 05:09:20.240 align:start position:0%
that's why we have the Manifest um
 
05:09:24.590 --> 05:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
hardship option but I do think um there
 
05:09:27.910 --> 05:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
are I think often in this room I hear
 
05:09:30.110 --> 05:09:30.120 align:start position:0%
Public Schools get characterized a lot
 
05:09:33.150 --> 05:09:33.160 align:start position:0%
as sort of one size fits-all
 
05:09:35.310 --> 05:09:35.320 align:start position:0%
I don't think they are I I I think they
 
05:09:38.150 --> 05:09:38.160 align:start position:0%
make a real effort to meet all the needs
 
05:09:41.470 --> 05:09:41.480 align:start position:0%
and no none of them is perfect I agree
 
05:09:45.708 --> 05:09:45.718 align:start position:0%
but this bill doesn't say let's find a
 
05:09:47.190 --> 05:09:47.200 align:start position:0%
school that's just not meeting a
 
05:09:49.070 --> 05:09:49.080 align:start position:0%
specific need it's saying if you just
 
05:09:50.590 --> 05:09:50.600 align:start position:0%
don't if you just
 
05:09:53.150 --> 05:09:53.160 align:start position:0%
don't it's it's much more broad than
 
05:09:55.430 --> 05:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
that it's much more vague than that and
 
05:09:57.910 --> 05:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
um I think there are better ways I think
 
05:09:59.470 --> 05:09:59.480 align:start position:0%
often when schools are not meeting
 
05:10:00.990 --> 05:10:01.000 align:start position:0%
somebody's needs it's because they don't
 
05:10:02.670 --> 05:10:02.680 align:start position:0%
have the resources to have that extra
 
05:10:04.910 --> 05:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
special ed teacher or that extra
 
05:10:06.910 --> 05:10:06.920 align:start position:0%
counselor but no I mean there's nothing
 
05:10:08.830 --> 05:10:08.840 align:start position:0%
is perfect there's no perfect system in
 
05:10:11.590 --> 05:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
the world and I'm sure I'm sure a lot of
 
05:10:15.070 --> 05:10:15.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:17.350 --> 05:10:17.360 align:start position:0%
either okay who did I say was next
 
05:10:17.360 --> 05:10:18.990 align:start position:0%
either okay who did I say was next
represent

05:10:18.990 --> 05:10:19.000 align:start position:0%
represent
 
05:10:24.628 --> 05:10:24.638 align:start position:0%
leus I'm trying to understand your point
 
05:10:27.948 --> 05:10:27.958 align:start position:0%
in that you said um that you wanted to
 
05:10:31.470 --> 05:10:31.480 align:start position:0%
see money go to all the students and yet
 
05:10:33.788 --> 05:10:33.798 align:start position:0%
it was my bill you testified on earlier
 
05:10:35.430 --> 05:10:35.440 align:start position:0%
where I was trying to get money to go to
 
05:10:37.948 --> 05:10:37.958 align:start position:0%
all the students and you didn't want to
 
05:10:40.670 --> 05:10:40.680 align:start position:0%
have that happen and
 
05:10:44.590 --> 05:10:44.600 align:start position:0%
so can you explain I think I must have
 
05:10:47.030 --> 05:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
misspoken or I wasn't clear I I didn't
 
05:10:49.150 --> 05:10:49.160 align:start position:0%
say I want are you are you asking me if
 
05:10:50.628 --> 05:10:50.638 align:start position:0%
that are you saying I'm now saying I
 
05:10:54.350 --> 05:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
want um efas to go to all the students
 
05:10:57.350 --> 05:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
not EFA money to go to support all the
 
05:11:00.030 --> 05:11:00.040 align:start position:0%
students to have a good education which
 
05:11:02.750 --> 05:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
is what I was trying to do with my bill
 
05:11:05.910 --> 05:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
but now you're saying so I'm just trying
 
05:11:08.548 --> 05:11:08.558 align:start position:0%
to understand what what it is that you
 
05:11:10.750 --> 05:11:10.760 align:start position:0%
want with the what money to go to all
 
05:11:13.788 --> 05:11:13.798 align:start position:0%
students the state money in the
 
05:11:16.190 --> 05:11:16.200 align:start position:0%
education trust fund that I would like
 
05:11:18.390 --> 05:11:18.400 align:start position:0%
to see go to all the public schools in a
 
05:11:21.470 --> 05:11:21.480 align:start position:0%
more equal way so that a Salem doesn't
 
05:11:23.548 --> 05:11:23.558 align:start position:0%
stand out as a place where somebody can
 
05:11:26.230 --> 05:11:26.240 align:start position:0%
get that kind of therapy but recognizes
 
05:11:29.110 --> 05:11:29.120 align:start position:0%
that his school isn't representative of
 
05:11:31.030 --> 05:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
the schools around the state and
 
05:11:32.548 --> 05:11:32.558 align:start position:0%
therefore he feels we need to take kids
 
05:11:33.830 --> 05:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
out of those other schools and give them
 
05:11:35.430 --> 05:11:35.440 align:start position:0%
other options so it's not all students
 
05:11:38.390 --> 05:11:38.400 align:start position:0%
it's all public yes please it's not all
 
05:11:40.110 --> 05:11:40.120 align:start position:0%
students it's all public schools that
 
05:11:42.310 --> 05:11:42.320 align:start position:0%
you want the m to go to that correct on
 
05:11:44.070 --> 05:11:44.080 align:start position:0%
behalf of those students thank you
 
05:11:45.350 --> 05:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
05:11:47.708 --> 05:11:47.718 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner thank you and
 
05:11:50.070 --> 05:11:50.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um in
 
05:11:51.830 --> 05:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
your research did you find any schools
 
05:11:55.830 --> 05:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't take lb lgbtq yes people
 
05:12:00.190 --> 05:12:00.200 align:start position:0%
um I did I quite a few um one I just
 
05:12:01.910 --> 05:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
have I wrote down a quote but I didn't
 
05:12:03.310 --> 05:12:03.320 align:start position:0%
want to get I didn't have time to get to
 
05:12:07.390 --> 05:12:07.400 align:start position:0%
it but um uh one's handbook says that we
 
05:12:08.628 --> 05:12:08.638 align:start position:0%
have reserved the right to deny
 
05:12:11.110 --> 05:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
admission to or expel a student for
 
05:12:14.190 --> 05:12:14.200 align:start position:0%
quote professing to be a homosexual SL
 
05:12:17.150 --> 05:12:17.160 align:start position:0%
bisexual transgender person or engaging
 
05:12:18.948 --> 05:12:18.958 align:start position:0%
or practicing homosexual bisexual
 
05:12:20.750 --> 05:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
transgender behaviors as well as
 
05:12:22.470 --> 05:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
condoning supporting or otherwise
 
05:12:24.830 --> 05:12:24.840 align:start position:0%
promoting such practices and that was
 
05:12:27.510 --> 05:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
one of quite a few it was just a sample
 
05:12:30.590 --> 05:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
could I have a followup on that yes so
 
05:12:33.230 --> 05:12:33.240 align:start position:0%
um we've had a lot of discussion about
 
05:12:36.830 --> 05:12:36.840 align:start position:0%
diversity inclusion and Equity um as
 
05:12:38.150 --> 05:12:38.160 align:start position:0%
something that shouldn't be in public
 
05:12:40.788 --> 05:12:40.798 align:start position:0%
schools do you feel as though that
 
05:12:43.670 --> 05:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
diversion inclusion and Equity is
 
05:12:45.990 --> 05:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
actually a way to make schools better
 
05:12:48.750 --> 05:12:48.760 align:start position:0%
Public Schools better for people that
 
05:12:52.750 --> 05:12:52.760 align:start position:0%
are lgbtq people who are bullied like
 
05:12:54.830 --> 05:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
whatever the other categories are in
 
05:12:56.590 --> 05:12:56.600 align:start position:0%
this particular thing probably doesn't
 
05:12:59.750 --> 05:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
do much for p but
 
05:13:02.470 --> 05:13:02.480 align:start position:0%
no I do and as a teacher
 
05:13:05.030 --> 05:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
the I used to wonder why are people out
 
05:13:08.230 --> 05:13:08.240 align:start position:0%
there saying such negative things about
 
05:13:10.788 --> 05:13:10.798 align:start position:0%
public schools and diversity is and and
 
05:13:13.110 --> 05:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
and about indoctrination I think are
 
05:13:16.670 --> 05:13:16.680 align:start position:0%
they worried because we you know we take
 
05:13:19.510 --> 05:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
everybody and so we have to say you
 
05:13:21.670 --> 05:13:21.680 align:start position:0%
can't use certain words in a derogatory
 
05:13:24.670 --> 05:13:24.680 align:start position:0%
way about certain classes of people or
 
05:13:27.030 --> 05:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
categories of people and so we all have
 
05:13:28.788 --> 05:13:28.798 align:start position:0%
to talk about those things because we
 
05:13:30.390 --> 05:13:30.400 align:start position:0%
take everybody you know what are you
 
05:13:32.430 --> 05:13:32.440 align:start position:0%
going to do the last class I taught I
 
05:13:35.590 --> 05:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
had 24 students eight of them were from
 
05:13:39.390 --> 05:13:39.400 align:start position:0%
um were refugees from Asia and Africa um
 
05:13:41.030 --> 05:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
who were speaking English as a second
 
05:13:43.830 --> 05:13:43.840 align:start position:0%
language and you know they were quote
 
05:13:45.430 --> 05:13:45.440 align:start position:0%
different from the students that most of
 
05:13:46.830 --> 05:13:46.840 align:start position:0%
my students had in earlier in their
 
05:13:49.190 --> 05:13:49.200 align:start position:0%
lives bumped into we have to talk you

and her brother who is on an IEP so I'm
 
05:15:50.470 --> 05:15:50.480 align:start position:0%

thank you
[Music]

05:15:59.230 --> 05:15:59.240 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:16:02.990 --> 05:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
um are you aware of any students who
 
05:16:05.708 --> 05:16:05.718 align:start position:0%
have had who have not been able to find
 
05:16:10.030 --> 05:16:10.040 align:start position:0%
a place that fits them you know a place
 
05:16:11.910 --> 05:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
I'm asking you because you have the
 
05:16:15.270 --> 05:16:15.280 align:start position:0%
children's scholarship money and
 
05:16:19.190 --> 05:16:19.200 align:start position:0%
whatever so um are you aware of any who
 
05:16:21.548 --> 05:16:21.558 align:start position:0%
were not then able to find a place that
 
05:16:24.670 --> 05:16:24.680 align:start position:0%
fits them uh no I mean honestly I think
 
05:16:26.190 --> 05:16:26.200 align:start position:0%
that this program has helped a lot of
 
05:16:28.270 --> 05:16:28.280 align:start position:0%
people I know that I work for CSF and
 
05:16:30.390 --> 05:16:30.400 align:start position:0%
you'll probably think that I have a bias
 
05:16:32.910 --> 05:16:32.920 align:start position:0%
um I I think that these this this
 
05:16:34.750 --> 05:16:34.760 align:start position:0%
program has helped a lot of students
 
05:16:36.788 --> 05:16:36.798 align:start position:0%
anecdotally I just helped a student that
 
05:16:40.390 --> 05:16:40.400 align:start position:0%
was 6 years old 7 years old this this
 
05:16:43.750 --> 05:16:43.760 align:start position:0%
weekend her her her mom contacted us
 
05:16:46.310 --> 05:16:46.320 align:start position:0%
because her initial order was rejected
 
05:16:47.270 --> 05:16:47.280 align:start position:0%
because we thought that it was a
 
05:16:49.470 --> 05:16:49.480 align:start position:0%
household item it was for a little it
 
05:16:52.350 --> 05:16:52.360 align:start position:0%
was for a little um mixer a handheld
 
05:16:54.590 --> 05:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
mixer we thought it was a household item
 
05:16:56.350 --> 05:16:56.360 align:start position:0%
and it turns out that this young girl
 
05:16:59.708 --> 05:16:59.718 align:start position:0%
was blind and deaf and in her IEP it
 
05:17:01.830 --> 05:17:01.840 align:start position:0%
called for she needed items that were
 
05:17:03.670 --> 05:17:03.680 align:start position:0%
manipulative so that she could learn
 
05:17:06.708 --> 05:17:06.718 align:start position:0%
through touch and through scent and so
 
05:17:08.868 --> 05:17:08.878 align:start position:0%
that I adjudicated that order I spoke
 
05:17:11.350 --> 05:17:11.360 align:start position:0%
with the mom this weekend and we got
 
05:17:12.628 --> 05:17:12.638 align:start position:0%
that straightened out and she was able
 
05:17:14.590 --> 05:17:14.600 align:start position:0%
to reorder her items and then I approved
 
05:17:18.390 --> 05:17:18.400 align:start position:0%
that order okay so thank you very much
 
05:17:19.830 --> 05:17:19.840 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions yes
 
05:17:22.110 --> 05:17:22.120 align:start position:0%

it's around $5,300 currently okay thank
 
05:17:33.868 --> 05:17:33.878 align:start position:0%

05:17:57.750 --> 05:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
house okay good afternoon Deborah H
 
05:17:59.190 --> 05:17:59.200 align:start position:0%
president of the American Federation of
 
05:18:00.948 --> 05:18:00.958 align:start position:0%
teachers New Hampshire and I'm here to
 
05:18:03.390 --> 05:18:03.400 align:start position:0%
speak opposition to HP
 
05:18:06.750 --> 05:18:06.760 align:start position:0%
1561 which would expand the state uh
 
05:18:08.948 --> 05:18:08.958 align:start position:0%
voucher program to different categories
 
05:18:11.910 --> 05:18:11.920 align:start position:0%
of student uh let me be clear on behalf
 
05:18:14.708 --> 05:18:14.718 align:start position:0%
of our 3700 members who mostly work in
 
05:18:17.070 --> 05:18:17.080 align:start position:0%
PRK through 12 Public Schools across the
 
05:18:21.470 --> 05:18:21.480 align:start position:0%
state we find that this would be um an
 
05:18:23.750 --> 05:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
inappropriate use of State funds in a
 
05:18:25.430 --> 05:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
way that does not benefit our granted
 
05:18:25.440 --> 05:18:26.708 align:start position:0%
way that does not benefit our granted
State

05:18:26.708 --> 05:18:26.718 align:start position:0%
State
 
05:18:29.190 --> 05:18:29.200 align:start position:0%
students uh Grand State students have so
 
05:18:31.510 --> 05:18:31.520 align:start position:0%
many needs right now stability academic
 
05:18:32.750 --> 05:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
challenges support to meet their
 
05:18:34.510 --> 05:18:34.520 align:start position:0%
learning needs and state welcoming
 
05:18:37.230 --> 05:18:37.240 align:start position:0%
schools where every student belongs
 
05:18:40.590 --> 05:18:40.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:44.750 --> 05:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
learn they do not want a expanded
 
05:18:47.430 --> 05:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
voucher program that seems to be aimed
 
05:18:51.868 --> 05:18:51.878 align:start position:0%
at dividing our communities dividing
 
05:18:53.948 --> 05:18:53.958 align:start position:0%
some parents from our public
 
05:18:56.150 --> 05:18:56.160 align:start position:0%
schools and uh much of what I was going
 
05:18:57.430 --> 05:18:57.440 align:start position:0%
to say has already been brought up in
 
05:18:59.030 --> 05:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
the questioning so I'm skipping around a
 
05:19:00.750 --> 05:19:00.760 align:start position:0%
little bit here but they want kids to
 
05:19:03.390 --> 05:19:03.400 align:start position:0%
get a well rounded education develop
 
05:19:05.548 --> 05:19:05.558 align:start position:0%
strong fundamental academic skills and
 
05:19:07.430 --> 05:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
have Pathways to Career College and
 
05:19:10.070 --> 05:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
Beyond that's what our families tell us
 
05:19:13.190 --> 05:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
that's what they have shown Us in local
 
05:19:14.830 --> 05:19:14.840 align:start position:0%
and Municipal elections and school
 
05:19:17.350 --> 05:19:17.360 align:start position:0%
boards people who have run on strong
 
05:19:20.350 --> 05:19:20.360 align:start position:0%
support for public schools have won in
 
05:19:22.910 --> 05:19:22.920 align:start position:0%
the past year in our Municipal elections
 
05:19:24.390 --> 05:19:24.400 align:start position:0%
they tell us this all the time that they
 
05:19:26.190 --> 05:19:26.200 align:start position:0%
want to see their Public Schools
 
05:19:28.708 --> 05:19:28.718 align:start position:0%
supported and they want to see it
 
05:19:32.270 --> 05:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
supported just as robustly in Claremont
 
05:19:34.910 --> 05:19:34.920 align:start position:0%
Franklin and Berlin as they are in
 
05:19:38.390 --> 05:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
Bedford Handover and Windom they want
 
05:19:41.670 --> 05:19:41.680 align:start position:0%
the opportunity for that public school
 
05:19:44.708 --> 05:19:44.718 align:start position:0%
education to be just as real and just as
 
05:19:47.628 --> 05:19:47.638 align:start position:0%
well resourced with the small class
 
05:19:50.510 --> 05:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
sizes the academic support the social
 
05:19:54.190 --> 05:19:54.200 align:start position:0%
emotional support that you get in your
 
05:19:57.430 --> 05:19:57.440 align:start position:0%
bedfords and Windom as you that you can
 
05:19:59.510 --> 05:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
get in Claremont and
 
05:20:02.350 --> 05:20:02.360 align:start position:0%
Berlin and
 
05:20:05.150 --> 05:20:05.160 align:start position:0%
having money go into any voucher program
 
05:20:07.788 --> 05:20:07.798 align:start position:0%
and expanding it like
 
05:20:10.510 --> 05:20:10.520 align:start position:0%
this makes it harder for the state to
 
05:20:13.430 --> 05:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
fulfill its duty to its granted State St
 
05:20:15.708 --> 05:20:15.718 align:start position:0%
to all students in the graned state
 
05:20:17.190 --> 05:20:17.200 align:start position:0%
because you do have a constitutional
 
05:20:19.030 --> 05:20:19.040 align:start position:0%
duty to each and every one of those
 
05:20:21.190 --> 05:20:21.200 align:start position:0%
Grant State students to provide that
 
05:20:24.350 --> 05:20:24.360 align:start position:0%
public education that is just as robust
 
05:20:26.868 --> 05:20:26.878 align:start position:0%
in every single District across the
 
05:20:30.628 --> 05:20:30.638 align:start position:0%
state and hits property taxpayers just
 
05:20:33.270 --> 05:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
as like lightly or just as hard in every
 
05:20:33.280 --> 05:20:36.150 align:start position:0%
as like lightly or just as hard in every
single

05:20:36.150 --> 05:20:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:39.910 --> 05:20:39.920 align:start position:0%
District uh it was brought up that this
 
05:20:43.830 --> 05:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
Voucher Program could allow
 
05:20:47.470 --> 05:20:47.480 align:start position:0%
vouchers for students who are lgbtq or
 
05:20:50.708 --> 05:20:50.718 align:start position:0%
family members who are but that there
 
05:20:50.718 --> 05:20:51.590 align:start position:0%
family members who are but that there
may

05:20:51.590 --> 05:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
may
 
05:20:54.510 --> 05:20:54.520 align:start position:0%
be um education service providers who do
 
05:20:58.910 --> 05:20:58.920 align:start position:0%
not accept such students and um we heard
 
05:21:00.708 --> 05:21:00.718 align:start position:0%
another speaker address that that that
 
05:21:02.670 --> 05:21:02.680 align:start position:0%
is indeed the case going by their
 
05:21:06.230 --> 05:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
handbooks I have some um citations on
 
05:21:08.868 --> 05:21:08.878 align:start position:0%
that and I will hand it in my
 
05:21:08.878 --> 05:21:13.430 align:start position:0%
that and I will hand it in my
testimony

05:21:13.430 --> 05:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:16.310 --> 05:21:16.320 align:start position:0%
um also an average
 
05:21:20.030 --> 05:21:20.040 align:start position:0%
$5,300 a year for a voucher is not going
 
05:21:24.230 --> 05:21:24.240 align:start position:0%
to get you into the promise that
 
05:21:25.868 --> 05:21:25.878 align:start position:0%
vouchers have that he going to get you
 
05:21:27.868 --> 05:21:27.878 align:start position:0%
you know help you with elite private
 
05:21:31.590 --> 05:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
schooling like Philip texer or St Paul's
 
05:21:33.190 --> 05:21:33.200 align:start position:0%
it's not going to come close to paying
 
05:21:37.750 --> 05:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
tuition for uh an elite private
 
05:21:40.670 --> 05:21:40.680 align:start position:0%
school the experience with most voucher
 
05:21:43.590 --> 05:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
programs across the country is that it
 
05:21:46.190 --> 05:21:46.200 align:start position:0%
actually harms
 
05:21:49.270 --> 05:21:49.280 align:start position:0%
academic achievement it has a worse
 
05:21:51.868 --> 05:21:51.878 align:start position:0%
impact on academic achievement than
 
05:21:55.270 --> 05:21:55.280 align:start position:0%
Hurricane krina Katrina or covid-19
 
05:21:57.628 --> 05:21:57.638 align:start position:0%
disruptions and I have citations of that
 
05:21:59.430 --> 05:21:59.440 align:start position:0%
as well and I will be emailing this
 
05:22:02.070 --> 05:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
because it's in links
 
05:22:04.548 --> 05:22:04.558 align:start position:0%
um expanding the school voucher program
 
05:22:06.628 --> 05:22:06.638 align:start position:0%
will help any child who needs our
 
05:22:09.150 --> 05:22:09.160 align:start position:0%
support it will
 
05:22:11.510 --> 05:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
only make it harder for the state to
 
05:22:13.390 --> 05:22:13.400 align:start position:0%
meet its constitutional obligation to
 
05:22:15.628 --> 05:22:15.638 align:start position:0%
all students which is to provide that
 
05:22:20.708 --> 05:22:20.718 align:start position:0%
robust public education
 
05:22:22.990 --> 05:22:23.000 align:start position:0%
system and let's be honest who benefits
 
05:22:24.430 --> 05:22:24.440 align:start position:0%
most from this bill it's not Granite
 
05:22:24.440 --> 05:22:25.230 align:start position:0%
most from this bill it's not Granite
State

05:22:25.230 --> 05:22:25.240 align:start position:0%
State
 
05:22:27.788 --> 05:22:27.798 align:start position:0%
students it's transparently a tax
 
05:22:30.548 --> 05:22:30.558 align:start position:0%
subsidy for families who are already
 
05:22:33.310 --> 05:22:33.320 align:start position:0%
choos choosing to send their students to
 
05:22:36.750 --> 05:22:36.760 align:start position:0%
private school or to homeschool
 
05:22:39.590 --> 05:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
them most of these students who are
 
05:22:39.600 --> 05:22:41.350 align:start position:0%
them most of these students who are
using

05:22:41.350 --> 05:22:41.360 align:start position:0%
using
 
05:22:44.708 --> 05:22:44.718 align:start position:0%
vouchers were not in public school when
 
05:22:48.270 --> 05:22:48.280 align:start position:0%
the program started and those uh joining
 
05:22:49.830 --> 05:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
the program have not been in public
 
05:22:51.070 --> 05:22:51.080 align:start position:0%
school they have not been leaving public
 
05:22:54.110 --> 05:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
school for this it's an education
 
05:22:56.510 --> 05:22:56.520 align:start position:0%
welfare program for those who can afford
 
05:22:58.628 --> 05:22:58.638 align:start position:0%
other options and it does nothing to
 
05:23:00.110 --> 05:23:00.120 align:start position:0%
help us meet our constitutional
 
05:23:03.230 --> 05:23:03.240 align:start position:0%
obligation to gr State students so I
 
05:23:06.430 --> 05:23:06.440 align:start position:0%
urge you to vote no on HB 1561 our kids
 
05:23:09.150 --> 05:23:09.160 align:start position:0%
deserve better than this they deserve a
 
05:23:11.830 --> 05:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
robust well-rounded opportunity for a
 
05:23:14.230 --> 05:23:14.240 align:start position:0%
public education in every single
 
05:23:16.270 --> 05:23:16.280 align:start position:0%
District in the state and our property
 
05:23:20.470 --> 05:23:20.480 align:start position:0%
tax payer payers deserve to be footing
 
05:23:23.868 --> 05:23:23.878 align:start position:0%
the bill at an equal rate across the
 
05:23:25.830 --> 05:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
state not heavier in one District than
 
05:23:27.788 --> 05:23:27.798 align:start position:0%
in another District so we can all
 
05:23:29.670 --> 05:23:29.680 align:start position:0%
benefit like the
 
05:23:32.430 --> 05:23:32.440 align:start position:0%
original um maker of the bill was
 
05:23:34.110 --> 05:23:34.120 align:start position:0%
talking about he benefited from his
 
05:23:37.030 --> 05:23:37.040 align:start position:0%
public schools and with that thank you
 
05:23:38.510 --> 05:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
are you willing to take questions I will
 
05:23:40.750 --> 05:23:40.760 align:start position:0%
take them I if I don't have the facts to
 
05:23:43.868 --> 05:23:43.878 align:start position:0%
answer them I will um get back to you
 
05:23:46.030 --> 05:23:46.040 align:start position:0%
because I do not want to answer
 
05:23:49.310 --> 05:23:49.320 align:start position:0%
unfactual represent dry y thank you Mr
 
05:23:50.948 --> 05:23:50.958 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking the
 
05:23:52.788 --> 05:23:52.798 align:start position:0%
question sorry you don't match your name
 
05:23:55.788 --> 05:23:55.798 align:start position:0%
tag that threw me off for a moment
 
05:23:59.788 --> 05:23:59.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:59.798 --> 05:24:01.470 align:start position:0%
 
and

05:24:01.470 --> 05:24:01.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:24:04.470 --> 05:24:04.480 align:start position:0%
thank you you continuously refer to the
 
05:24:07.470 --> 05:24:07.480 align:start position:0%
program as a voucher program the voucher
 
05:24:09.030 --> 05:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
program was repealed in
 
05:24:12.670 --> 05:24:12.680 align:start position:0%
1988 so there's no statutory definition
 
05:24:14.708 --> 05:24:14.718 align:start position:0%
of a voucher
 
05:24:16.948 --> 05:24:16.958 align:start position:0%
program is there a question that wasn't
 
05:24:20.390 --> 05:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
a question is there do in the you prer
 
05:24:23.470 --> 05:24:23.480 align:start position:0%
another term I would for a language
 
05:24:27.390 --> 05:24:27.400 align:start position:0%
point of view statutory Le defined thing
 
05:24:28.590 --> 05:24:28.600 align:start position:0%
that you could
 
05:24:31.470 --> 05:24:31.480 align:start position:0%
use so it's not a Bach program
 
05:24:33.948 --> 05:24:33.958 align:start position:0%
voucher system voucher scheme sounds
 
05:24:38.070 --> 05:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
judgmental so follow would you consider
 
05:24:39.628 --> 05:24:39.638 align:start position:0%
educational Freedom accounts which is
 
05:24:42.230 --> 05:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
what the bill is about well it's a
 
05:24:45.548 --> 05:24:45.558 align:start position:0%
voucher though so I do yeah something
 
05:24:47.310 --> 05:24:47.320 align:start position:0%
are there other questions represent
 
05:24:49.788 --> 05:24:49.798 align:start position:0%
cordelli uh thank you thank you for
 
05:24:53.548 --> 05:24:53.558 align:start position:0%
being here um a lot of the uh uh
 
05:24:55.430 --> 05:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
concerns you raised about this bill
 
05:24:57.670 --> 05:24:57.680 align:start position:0%
related to funding and funding of public
 
05:25:00.830 --> 05:25:00.840 align:start position:0%
schools um but how about the actual CR
 
05:25:03.788 --> 05:25:03.798 align:start position:0%
criteria in this bill for eligibility
 
05:25:06.590 --> 05:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
for students um for instance a
 
05:25:08.750 --> 05:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
persistent bullied student I don't think
 
05:25:12.150 --> 05:25:12.160 align:start position:0%
has anything to do with uh funding for a
 
05:25:16.628 --> 05:25:16.638 align:start position:0%
school in particular so wouldn't that be
 
05:25:20.110 --> 05:25:20.120 align:start position:0%
um a valid option uh for a child who is
 
05:25:23.150 --> 05:25:23.160 align:start position:0%
being persistently bullied and uh uh not
 
05:25:25.868 --> 05:25:25.878 align:start position:0%
having a remedy in the local school to
 
05:25:27.948 --> 05:25:27.958 align:start position:0%
uh possibly get an education Freedom
 
05:25:31.190 --> 05:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
account that there are two uh parts to
 
05:25:35.110 --> 05:25:35.120 align:start position:0%
my response one is um there is already
 
05:25:38.030 --> 05:25:38.040 align:start position:0%
the Manifest hardship route that a
 
05:25:39.910 --> 05:25:39.920 align:start position:0%
family can take and certainly there are
 
05:25:42.590 --> 05:25:42.600 align:start position:0%
cases where a student is being bullied
 
05:25:44.788 --> 05:25:44.798 align:start position:0%
and you know the option should be
 
05:25:45.830 --> 05:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
considered working through the
 
05:25:47.510 --> 05:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
counseling working through the chain of
 
05:25:49.430 --> 05:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
command and the principal and Reporting
 
05:25:51.708 --> 05:25:51.718 align:start position:0%
um all issues as always should be done
 
05:25:53.788 --> 05:25:53.798 align:start position:0%
when there are instances like that
 
05:25:57.070 --> 05:25:57.080 align:start position:0%
another part to that response though is
 
05:25:59.670 --> 05:25:59.680 align:start position:0%
is there enough staff on hand is there
 
05:26:02.590 --> 05:26:02.600 align:start position:0%
enough supervision on hand are are there
 
05:26:05.670 --> 05:26:05.680 align:start position:0%
the right number of behavior specialist
 
05:26:07.830 --> 05:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
counselors to deal with the student
 
05:26:10.230 --> 05:26:10.240 align:start position:0%
population in that school so there could
 
05:26:12.788 --> 05:26:12.798 align:start position:0%
be uh evidence of a systemic problem
 
05:26:15.110 --> 05:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
especially if there's more than just one
 
05:26:17.390 --> 05:26:17.400 align:start position:0%
isolated incident of incident of
 
05:26:21.548 --> 05:26:21.558 align:start position:0%
bullying so you could be talking about a
 
05:26:25.110 --> 05:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
funding issue that you do not
 
05:26:29.910 --> 05:26:29.920 align:start position:0%
have uh an appropriate Staffing level in
 
05:26:32.070 --> 05:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
the school to to take care of all the
 
05:26:36.548 --> 05:26:36.558 align:start position:0%
students needs in that school yes um and
 
05:26:38.230 --> 05:26:38.240 align:start position:0%
you're right there there are options
 
05:26:41.430 --> 05:26:41.440 align:start position:0%
because uh a student now who is
 
05:26:45.270 --> 05:26:45.280 align:start position:0%
persistently bullied and that in that um
 
05:26:46.948 --> 05:26:46.958 align:start position:0%
situation is being neglected by the
 
05:26:49.270 --> 05:26:49.280 align:start position:0%
school uh can actually sue the school
 
05:26:51.190 --> 05:26:51.200 align:start position:0%
district so that is another option for
 
05:26:53.110 --> 05:26:53.120 align:start position:0%
that student um you're correct in that
 
05:26:55.470 --> 05:26:55.480 align:start position:0%
regard um but you also mentioned U
 
05:26:58.590 --> 05:26:58.600 align:start position:0%
manifest education hardship um how about
 
05:27:01.110 --> 05:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
a student who is granted manifest
 
05:27:04.470 --> 05:27:04.480 align:start position:0%
education hardship as in um I or excuse
 
05:27:07.628 --> 05:27:07.638 align:start position:0%
me J um but goes to their neighboring
 
05:27:11.350 --> 05:27:11.360 align:start position:0%
public school and is denied admission or
 
05:27:14.190 --> 05:27:14.200 align:start position:0%
the other public school neighboring that
 
05:27:16.430 --> 05:27:16.440 align:start position:0%
district and it's denied
 
05:27:18.750 --> 05:27:18.760 align:start position:0%
addition admission into that public
 
05:27:21.590 --> 05:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
school and um this child happens to be
 
05:27:24.190 --> 05:27:24.200 align:start position:0%
special needs shouldn't that child have
 
05:27:24.200 --> 05:27:29.510 align:start position:0%
special needs shouldn't that child have
another

05:27:29.510 --> 05:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:29.520 --> 05:27:34.430 align:start position:0%
 
option

05:27:34.430 --> 05:27:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:36.390 --> 05:27:36.400 align:start position:0%
I I think that was a question you think
 
05:27:45.548 --> 05:27:45.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:47.628 --> 05:27:47.638 align:start position:0%
you're yeah I would have to look at the
 
05:27:49.390 --> 05:27:49.400 align:start position:0%
statute to see if there is already an
 
05:27:53.548 --> 05:27:53.558 align:start position:0%
Avenue for uh appealing denials so that
 
05:27:55.470 --> 05:27:55.480 align:start position:0%
you can find a correct fit this seems
 
05:27:59.350 --> 05:27:59.360 align:start position:0%
like an awfully extreme option to create
 
05:28:01.430 --> 05:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
um what's essentially Universal voucher
 
05:28:03.628 --> 05:28:03.638 align:start position:0%
system with what's going to be an $83
 
05:28:08.190 --> 05:28:08.200 align:start position:0%
million in new spending in FY 2025 alone
 
05:28:09.788 --> 05:28:09.798 align:start position:0%
that's new spending on top of the
 
05:28:13.310 --> 05:28:13.320 align:start position:0%
existing spending in the voucher system
 
05:28:16.110 --> 05:28:16.120 align:start position:0%
um if we don't like
 
05:28:18.868 --> 05:28:18.878 align:start position:0%
program yes are there further questions
 
05:28:18.878 --> 05:28:20.350 align:start position:0%
program yes are there further questions
represent

05:28:20.350 --> 05:28:20.360 align:start position:0%
represent
 
05:28:23.948 --> 05:28:23.958 align:start position:0%
leus yes the amount in addition that you
 
05:28:26.070 --> 05:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
just mentioned how did you come up with
 
05:28:26.080 --> 05:28:27.430 align:start position:0%
just mentioned how did you come up with
that

05:28:27.430 --> 05:28:27.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:28:31.270 --> 05:28:31.280 align:start position:0%
amount uh that was an analysis
 
05:28:33.670 --> 05:28:33.680 align:start position:0%
I believe bring higher New Hampshire did
 
05:28:44.070 --> 05:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:46.230 --> 05:28:46.240 align:start position:0%
on I would have to look at their put
 
05:28:48.110 --> 05:28:48.120 align:start position:0%
notes to tell you exactly how they
 
05:28:50.270 --> 05:28:50.280 align:start position:0%
derive that but they did the math thank
 
05:28:52.110 --> 05:28:52.120 align:start position:0%
you you're welcome so just as a point of
 
05:28:54.510 --> 05:28:54.520 align:start position:0%
clarification then uh because I was
 
05:28:56.390 --> 05:28:56.400 align:start position:0%
going to ask about the fiscal notes we
 
05:28:58.548 --> 05:28:58.558 align:start position:0%
have 49 bills with fiscal notes of which
 
05:29:00.510 --> 05:29:00.520 align:start position:0%
we haven't received over half of them
 
05:29:04.548 --> 05:29:04.558 align:start position:0%
the fiscal notes yep so your data does
 
05:29:06.150 --> 05:29:06.160 align:start position:0%
not come from the
 
05:29:09.868 --> 05:29:09.878 align:start position:0%
LBA no no my data not come from the lb
 
05:29:14.548 --> 05:29:14.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:17.030 --> 05:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
committee thank you very much okay like
 
05:29:28.030 --> 05:29:28.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:30.270 --> 05:29:30.280 align:start position:0%
Hawkins uh good afternoon Mr chair
 
05:29:31.708 --> 05:29:31.718 align:start position:0%
chairman members of the committee for
 
05:29:33.190 --> 05:29:33.200 align:start position:0%
the record Brian Hawkins today
 
05:29:35.390 --> 05:29:35.400 align:start position:0%
representing Nea New Hampshire I will
 
05:29:37.390 --> 05:29:37.400 align:start position:0%
try not to repeat a lot of what has
 
05:29:40.548 --> 05:29:40.558 align:start position:0%
already been said today um we're here in
 
05:29:44.310 --> 05:29:44.320 align:start position:0%
opposition to uh HP
 
05:29:47.590 --> 05:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
1561 um we feel that this legislation
 
05:29:50.150 --> 05:29:50.160 align:start position:0%
would result in a dramatic expansion of
 
05:29:51.590 --> 05:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
the school Voucher Program something
 
05:29:54.310 --> 05:29:54.320 align:start position:0%
that the legislature rejected last year
 
05:29:56.110 --> 05:29:56.120 align:start position:0%
because of the potential Financial
 
05:29:58.470 --> 05:29:58.480 align:start position:0%
consequences it could have with our
 
05:30:01.030 --> 05:30:01.040 align:start position:0%
ability to support uh
 
05:30:03.470 --> 05:30:03.480 align:start position:0%
a universal public education for New
 
05:30:07.150 --> 05:30:07.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire students um specifically this
 
05:30:09.390 --> 05:30:09.400 align:start position:0%
bill and to certain extent the previous
 
05:30:12.110 --> 05:30:12.120 align:start position:0%
Bill did this by lifting the income cap
 
05:30:15.430 --> 05:30:15.440 align:start position:0%
on certain categories of students and
 
05:30:18.670 --> 05:30:18.680 align:start position:0%
when uh HB 464 from last year was
 
05:30:23.470 --> 05:30:23.480 align:start position:0%
rejected um that was uh done so um in
 
05:30:25.548 --> 05:30:25.558 align:start position:0%
Senate education in the Senate education
 
05:30:28.868 --> 05:30:28.878 align:start position:0%
committee with the concern that it would
 
05:30:32.190 --> 05:30:32.200 align:start position:0%
um uh potentially blow a hole completely
 
05:30:37.230 --> 05:30:37.240 align:start position:0%
into the uh education trust fund um so
 
05:30:41.070 --> 05:30:41.080 align:start position:0%
with this bill the extraordinarily Broad
 
05:30:42.708 --> 05:30:42.718 align:start position:0%
and somewhat vague categories of
 
05:30:45.948 --> 05:30:45.958 align:start position:0%
students between these uh this bill and
 
05:30:48.548 --> 05:30:48.558 align:start position:0%
the last bill create what amounts to a
 
05:30:51.310 --> 05:30:51.320 align:start position:0%
universal uh eligibility to the school
 
05:30:53.708 --> 05:30:53.718 align:start position:0%
voucher program and as uh president
 
05:30:57.110 --> 05:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
Tuttle mentioned earlier this morning um
 
05:31:00.470 --> 05:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
we've seen what that has resulted in in
 
05:31:02.190 --> 05:31:02.200 align:start position:0%
States like Arizona where they're now
 
05:31:05.310 --> 05:31:05.320 align:start position:0%
facing a budget deficit uh uh in large
 
05:31:09.628 --> 05:31:09.638 align:start position:0%
part due to that uh program being 1400%
 
05:31:13.310 --> 05:31:13.320 align:start position:0%
over uh the budgeted amount for that um
 
05:31:15.350 --> 05:31:15.360 align:start position:0%
for that amount we you know we're we
 
05:31:18.070 --> 05:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
have a subcommittee now obviously some
 
05:31:21.230 --> 05:31:21.240 align:start position:0%
of you are on it um to try and get to a
 
05:31:22.750 --> 05:31:22.760 align:start position:0%
point where we're not
 
05:31:25.150 --> 05:31:25.160 align:start position:0%
50th in the nation in terms of the state
 
05:31:29.030 --> 05:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
support for uh its share of uh public
 
05:31:33.670 --> 05:31:33.680 align:start position:0%
education um um the uh no income limit
 
05:31:35.190 --> 05:31:35.200 align:start position:0%
on various
 
05:31:38.270 --> 05:31:38.280 align:start position:0%
categories um is also concerned because
 
05:31:40.070 --> 05:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
there's no additional accountability
 
05:31:40.080 --> 05:31:44.150 align:start position:0%
there's no additional accountability
measures

05:31:44.150 --> 05:31:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:47.070 --> 05:31:47.080 align:start position:0%
um the uh legislature has also just
 
05:31:50.270 --> 05:31:50.280 align:start position:0%
begun work uh you mentioned legislative
 
05:31:52.590 --> 05:31:52.600 align:start position:0%
budget assistant on a performance audit
 
05:31:55.830 --> 05:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
for the program that only began I think
 
05:32:00.350 --> 05:32:00.360 align:start position:0%
days or weeks ago um and so we feel be
 
05:32:02.830 --> 05:32:02.840 align:start position:0%
premature to expand the program before
 
05:32:05.070 --> 05:32:05.080 align:start position:0%
that uh audit is
 
05:32:05.080 --> 05:32:10.750 align:start position:0%
that uh audit is
complete

05:32:10.750 --> 05:32:10.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:14.628 --> 05:32:14.638 align:start position:0%
um we uh we mentioned uh some of the uh
 
05:32:16.830 --> 05:32:16.840 align:start position:0%
the categories earlier outlined into the
 
05:32:19.548 --> 05:32:19.558 align:start position:0%
bill I would just add uh additional
 
05:32:23.628 --> 05:32:23.638 align:start position:0%
concern here is that um you're not
 
05:32:27.150 --> 05:32:27.160 align:start position:0%
adding any Protections in the EFA law
 
05:32:29.310 --> 05:32:29.320 align:start position:0%
for the students that are in some of
 
05:32:30.708 --> 05:32:30.718 align:start position:0%
these categories
 
05:32:33.070 --> 05:32:33.080 align:start position:0%
that it's purporting to help and so
 
05:32:34.910 --> 05:32:34.920 align:start position:0%
there are no anti-discrimination
 
05:32:38.948 --> 05:32:38.958 align:start position:0%
protections in uh in the law in the EFA
 
05:32:41.190 --> 05:32:41.200 align:start position:0%
law uh nor does it
 
05:32:44.590 --> 05:32:44.600 align:start position:0%
extend uh protections like there are in
 
05:32:47.070 --> 05:32:47.080 align:start position:0%
the uh State bullying law to private
 
05:32:49.708 --> 05:32:49.718 align:start position:0%
schools uh it was mentioned admission
 
05:32:52.350 --> 05:32:52.360 align:start position:0%
was mentioned earlier too
 
05:32:55.470 --> 05:32:55.480 align:start position:0%
um and the program shifts a lot of key
 
05:32:58.150 --> 05:32:58.160 align:start position:0%
expenses to parents who then of and have
 
05:33:00.590 --> 05:33:00.600 align:start position:0%
to subsidize private tuition for
 
05:33:02.190 --> 05:33:02.200 align:start position:0%
families who would never have enrolled
 
05:33:05.270 --> 05:33:05.280 align:start position:0%
in a public school uh I'll conclude by
 
05:33:09.230 --> 05:33:09.240 align:start position:0%
just saying that you know we finished a
 
05:33:11.948 --> 05:33:11.958 align:start position:0%
uh teacher shortage committee um this
 
05:33:14.390 --> 05:33:14.400 align:start position:0%
past year where we talked about the need
 
05:33:18.150 --> 05:33:18.160 align:start position:0%
to do things like reduce class sizes
 
05:33:18.160 --> 05:33:19.030 align:start position:0%
to do things like reduce class sizes
raise

05:33:19.030 --> 05:33:19.040 align:start position:0%
raise
 
05:33:22.430 --> 05:33:22.440 align:start position:0%
pay uh so that we can address the
 
05:33:24.830 --> 05:33:24.840 align:start position:0%
shortages that are in our schools not
 
05:33:26.350 --> 05:33:26.360 align:start position:0%
only with teachers but with support
 
05:33:30.230 --> 05:33:30.240 align:start position:0%
staff as well um and rather than divert
 
05:33:32.910 --> 05:33:32.920 align:start position:0%
money to this
 
05:33:36.390 --> 05:33:36.400 align:start position:0%
program uh which as far as we can tell
 
05:33:37.750 --> 05:33:37.760 align:start position:0%
is an unknown amount because of these
 
05:33:39.510 --> 05:33:39.520 align:start position:0%
very broad some of these very broad
 
05:33:42.430 --> 05:33:42.440 align:start position:0%
categories we should address that uh
 
05:33:46.110 --> 05:33:46.120 align:start position:0%
Workforce issue uh first um so thank you
 
05:33:48.788 --> 05:33:48.798 align:start position:0%
for your uh time and I'm happy to answer
 
05:33:50.750 --> 05:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
any questions thank you very much Mr
 
05:33:52.948 --> 05:33:52.958 align:start position:0%
Hawkins are there any questions yes
 
05:33:55.310 --> 05:33:55.320 align:start position:0%
represent pel thank you Mr chair and
 
05:33:57.750 --> 05:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here and taking my
 
05:34:00.150 --> 05:34:00.160 align:start position:0%
question this is a question relating
 
05:34:04.270 --> 05:34:04.280 align:start position:0%
classroom size so if students left the
 
05:34:06.750 --> 05:34:06.760 align:start position:0%
classroom in pursuit of an education
 
05:34:09.708 --> 05:34:09.718 align:start position:0%
Freedom account um opportunity would
 
05:34:12.948 --> 05:34:12.958 align:start position:0%
that reduce the classroom
 
05:34:16.910 --> 05:34:16.920 align:start position:0%
size well uh depending on how many uh
 
05:34:19.030 --> 05:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
students left um because of the funding
 
05:34:22.590 --> 05:34:22.600 align:start position:0%
model that we use in the state um the
 
05:34:27.310 --> 05:34:27.320 align:start position:0%
students who uh are going to remain um
 
05:34:30.390 --> 05:34:30.400 align:start position:0%
there the community would um shoulder an
 
05:34:33.070 --> 05:34:33.080 align:start position:0%
even larger burden to help
 
05:34:36.990 --> 05:34:37.000 align:start position:0%
maintain the personnel and the uh
 
05:34:38.948 --> 05:34:38.958 align:start position:0%
building itself so I don't I don't see
 
05:34:44.628 --> 05:34:44.638 align:start position:0%
how um you know uh kid kids leaving the
 
05:34:49.110 --> 05:34:49.120 align:start position:0%
public school is going to help with
 
05:34:51.868 --> 05:34:51.878 align:start position:0%
um encouraging class size it probably
 
05:34:54.510 --> 05:34:54.520 align:start position:0%
will encourage consolidation of anything
 
05:34:57.670 --> 05:34:57.680 align:start position:0%
into larger classes so that would be a
 
05:35:01.190 --> 05:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
concern further questions
 
05:35:02.830 --> 05:35:02.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much appreciate your time
 
05:35:14.070 --> 05:35:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:18.590 --> 05:35:18.600 align:start position:0%
B good afternoon um Mr chairman
 
05:35:21.390 --> 05:35:21.400 align:start position:0%
and thank you so I just like to First
 
05:35:24.548 --> 05:35:24.558 align:start position:0%
say that I'm in support of this bill I
 
05:35:27.910 --> 05:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
am actually a receiver of the EFA I was
 
05:35:30.868 --> 05:35:30.878 align:start position:0%
uh homeschooled and um up until last
 
05:35:33.390 --> 05:35:33.400 align:start position:0%
year and now I'm in an awesome small
 
05:35:36.310 --> 05:35:36.320 align:start position:0%
private school in candy New Hampshire
 
05:35:38.628 --> 05:35:38.638 align:start position:0%
and they have fulfilled many of my needs
 
05:35:40.628 --> 05:35:40.638 align:start position:0%
that I would have struggled with I have
 
05:35:43.150 --> 05:35:43.160 align:start position:0%
one of them is math I'm a little behind
 
05:35:45.110 --> 05:35:45.120 align:start position:0%
in math and last year was even more
 
05:35:47.830 --> 05:35:47.840 align:start position:0%
behind and since they're smaller they
 
05:35:49.948 --> 05:35:49.958 align:start position:0%
actually allowed me to have a private
 
05:35:55.110 --> 05:35:55.120 align:start position:0%
tutor and I did three years of math in
 
05:35:57.430 --> 05:35:57.440 align:start position:0%
four semesters and now I'm caught up and
 
05:35:59.150 --> 05:35:59.160 align:start position:0%
I'm only a year behind and then next
 
05:36:01.830 --> 05:36:01.840 align:start position:0%
year I'll be doing regular grades with
 
05:36:05.628 --> 05:36:05.638 align:start position:0%
math with my class um the public schools
 
05:36:07.548 --> 05:36:07.558 align:start position:0%
they you know they fulfill a lot of
 
05:36:10.310 --> 05:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
needs for a lot of other children but
 
05:36:13.070 --> 05:36:13.080 align:start position:0%
the problem is once it gets to such a
 
05:36:15.430 --> 05:36:15.440 align:start position:0%
certain size some of my own personal
 
05:36:17.230 --> 05:36:17.240 align:start position:0%
friends I have never been to public
 
05:36:19.628 --> 05:36:19.638 align:start position:0%
school but I have friends that went it
 
05:36:21.708 --> 05:36:21.718 align:start position:0%
just they don't always meet all the
 
05:36:24.470 --> 05:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
certain needs of every single
 
05:36:26.788 --> 05:36:26.798 align:start position:0%
individual and so the what the EFA
 
05:36:29.868 --> 05:36:29.878 align:start position:0%
allows is for that individual to to be
 
05:36:32.390 --> 05:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
able to take the money that they would
 
05:36:33.548 --> 05:36:33.558 align:start position:0%
still receive through the state if
 
05:36:35.310 --> 05:36:35.320 align:start position:0%
they're in public school and allow them
 
05:36:38.670 --> 05:36:38.680 align:start position:0%
to go to a better place maybe that fits
 
05:36:42.708 --> 05:36:42.718 align:start position:0%
their needs better you know um cuz
 
05:36:45.150 --> 05:36:45.160 align:start position:0%
School especially teenagers middle
 
05:36:47.310 --> 05:36:47.320 align:start position:0%
schoolers and young kids they spend the
 
05:36:49.548 --> 05:36:49.558 align:start position:0%
majority of their four years you know
 
05:36:51.990 --> 05:36:52.000 align:start position:0%
maybe of that lifetime there and it can
 
05:36:54.750 --> 05:36:54.760 align:start position:0%
really affect a difference this small
 
05:36:57.390 --> 05:36:57.400 align:start position:0%
school I went to they've had kids two of
 
05:37:00.190 --> 05:37:00.200 align:start position:0%
them are from Nigeria um
 
05:37:02.310 --> 05:37:02.320 align:start position:0%
and they picked this school because
 
05:37:04.830 --> 05:37:04.840 align:start position:0%
they're able to help fulfill their needs
 
05:37:06.350 --> 05:37:06.360 align:start position:0%
you know maybe a little behind in
 
05:37:08.548 --> 05:37:08.558 align:start position:0%
English and others like that we also
 
05:37:10.628 --> 05:37:10.638 align:start position:0%
have two Chinese students and they're
 
05:37:12.270 --> 05:37:12.280 align:start position:0%
able to fulfill their needs because
 
05:37:15.390 --> 05:37:15.400 align:start position:0%
they're smaller so I think that this is
 
05:37:17.510 --> 05:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
a really good bill because it allows
 
05:37:20.430 --> 05:37:20.440 align:start position:0%
each individual to pick and choose what
 
05:37:22.070 --> 05:37:22.080 align:start position:0%

just I wouldn't normally ask but could I
 
05:38:13.190 --> 05:38:13.200 align:start position:0%
ask your age um 17 great follow up yes
 
05:38:16.270 --> 05:38:16.280 align:start position:0%
um from your description of your class
 
05:38:19.230 --> 05:38:19.240 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure their opinions on things
 
05:38:21.070 --> 05:38:21.080 align:start position:0%
but it seems like quite a diverse
 
05:38:22.948 --> 05:38:22.958 align:start position:0%
classroom you're in it how many how many
 
05:38:24.788 --> 05:38:24.798 align:start position:0%
students are in the classroom um so even
 
05:38:26.390 --> 05:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
though it's smaller school I only have
 
05:38:28.910 --> 05:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
um 11 kids in my class but I have one
 
05:38:32.470 --> 05:38:32.480 align:start position:0%
boy from Nigeria uh one girl from China
 
05:38:34.868 --> 05:38:34.878 align:start position:0%
who was able to come here is a very
 
05:38:36.310 --> 05:38:36.320 align:start position:0%
diverse class so even though it's
 
05:38:38.830 --> 05:38:38.840 align:start position:0%
smaller it all fits our needs better and
 
05:38:41.310 --> 05:38:41.320 align:start position:0%
we we we're all closer honestly like as
 
05:38:44.830 --> 05:38:44.840 align:start position:0%
a group thank you any further questions
 
05:38:48.070 --> 05:38:48.080 align:start position:0%
of Alicia yes representa Tanner thank
 
05:38:49.628 --> 05:38:49.638 align:start position:0%
you for coming and you're doing a great
 
05:38:52.510 --> 05:38:52.520 align:start position:0%
job I I was having difficulty hearing
 
05:38:56.868 --> 05:38:56.878 align:start position:0%
though which is my issue um did you say
 
05:38:58.830 --> 05:38:58.840 align:start position:0%
that you had not attended any public
 
05:39:02.110 --> 05:39:02.120 align:start position:0%
high school no no but I have a lot of
 
05:39:04.590 --> 05:39:04.600 align:start position:0%
friends who uh went from public school
 
05:39:08.270 --> 05:39:08.280 align:start position:0%
to Jesse Remington and maybe a few of
 
05:39:11.270 --> 05:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
them bullying problems or just that the
 
05:39:15.030 --> 05:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
teacher was not able um to fit their
 
05:39:18.548 --> 05:39:18.558 align:start position:0%
specific needs one of um the girls had
 
05:39:20.670 --> 05:39:20.680 align:start position:0%
she's a very nice girl and a really good
 
05:39:22.468 --> 05:39:22.478 align:start position:0%
friend of mine but she had a lot of
 
05:39:24.868 --> 05:39:24.878 align:start position:0%
problems with anxiety so even though she
 
05:39:27.468 --> 05:39:27.478 align:start position:0%
was a high overachiever and she was
 
05:39:29.430 --> 05:39:29.440 align:start position:0%
always getting good grades the you know
 
05:39:30.750 --> 05:39:30.760 align:start position:0%
because of the larger class size the
 
05:39:32.868 --> 05:39:32.878 align:start position:0%
school was overlooking that so when she
 
05:39:34.670 --> 05:39:34.680 align:start position:0%
came to our school it came like very
 
05:39:37.190 --> 05:39:37.200 align:start position:0%
relevant if she didn't get like a 98 or
 
05:39:39.070 --> 05:39:39.080 align:start position:0%
something she would have like a mini
 
05:39:41.110 --> 05:39:41.120 align:start position:0%
panic attack seriously and unfortunately
 
05:39:45.868 --> 05:39:45.878 align:start position:0%
that led to a um some serious mental
 
05:39:48.750 --> 05:39:48.760 align:start position:0%
health stuff for her but uh the school
 
05:39:50.430 --> 05:39:50.440 align:start position:0%
the past year they've still been helping
 
05:39:52.150 --> 05:39:52.160 align:start position:0%
her with school work the teacher talked
 
05:39:54.270 --> 05:39:54.280 align:start position:0%
her each week and I'm glad to say she's
 
05:39:57.110 --> 05:39:57.120 align:start position:0%
going to return with us tomorrow good
 
05:40:00.788 --> 05:40:00.798 align:start position:0%
thank you so much any further questions
 
05:40:02.708 --> 05:40:02.718 align:start position:0%
well thank you very much I applaud you
 
05:40:05.788 --> 05:40:05.798 align:start position:0%
on your your ability to communicate what
 
05:40:07.628 --> 05:40:07.638 align:start position:0%
you wanted to do today and I you did an
 
05:40:09.350 --> 05:40:09.360 align:start position:0%
excellent job and on behalf of the whole
 
05:40:14.628 --> 05:40:14.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:17.948 --> 05:40:17.958 align:start position:0%
you last speaker Kate
 
05:40:21.350 --> 05:40:21.360 align:start position:0%
Shay thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
05:40:24.070 --> 05:40:24.080 align:start position:0%
committee Kate Shay from gtown seen many
 
05:40:26.590 --> 05:40:26.600 align:start position:0%
of you in the past good to be here again
 
05:40:28.230 --> 05:40:28.240 align:start position:0%
there's a quote that I really like which
 
05:40:30.430 --> 05:40:30.440 align:start position:0%
says when the human in me sees the human
 
05:40:33.670 --> 05:40:33.680 align:start position:0%
in you we make progress and I wanted to
 
05:40:35.230 --> 05:40:35.240 align:start position:0%
start out with that because I'm very
 
05:40:37.468 --> 05:40:37.478 align:start position:0%
much human today coming up a very
 
05:40:38.750 --> 05:40:38.760 align:start position:0%
difficult year of losing my father and
 
05:40:41.390 --> 05:40:41.400 align:start position:0%
my mother and just being sick myself so
 
05:40:43.030 --> 05:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
please forgive me as I try to read these
 
05:40:45.468 --> 05:40:45.478 align:start position:0%
words that are way too small for my old
 
05:40:49.948 --> 05:40:49.958 align:start position:0%
eyes um I'm here to support all of these
 
05:40:53.708 --> 05:40:53.718 align:start position:0%
EFA bills today um just very
 
05:40:56.548 --> 05:40:56.558 align:start position:0%
briefly I'm the standing Survivor of
 
05:41:00.150 --> 05:41:00.160 align:start position:0%
some Devastation to my family personally
 
05:41:02.948 --> 05:41:02.958 align:start position:0%
and have seen it in my own town back in
 
05:41:04.708 --> 05:41:04.718 align:start position:0%
2020 I'm going to go off the rails here
 
05:41:06.948 --> 05:41:06.958 align:start position:0%
a little bit we had groups of people
 
05:41:09.190 --> 05:41:09.200 align:start position:0%
coming into the school board and arguing
 
05:41:12.310 --> 05:41:12.320 align:start position:0%
over masks or no masks and it was this
 
05:41:14.310 --> 05:41:14.320 align:start position:0%
huge division right does everybody
 
05:41:17.510 --> 05:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
remember that and I went in with some
 
05:41:19.430 --> 05:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
information from the doe some new
 
05:41:21.310 --> 05:41:21.320 align:start position:0%
programs coming out and they said I
 
05:41:22.868 --> 05:41:22.878 align:start position:0%
don't think we have to make a decision
 
05:41:25.190 --> 05:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
of us against them I think we can come
 
05:41:28.190 --> 05:41:28.200 align:start position:0%
up with something that fits both sides
 
05:41:29.990 --> 05:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
and our district on unfortunately did
 
05:41:31.868 --> 05:41:31.878 align:start position:0%
not want to take part in that but I'm
 
05:41:35.070 --> 05:41:35.080 align:start position:0%
happy to say that those homeschool they
 
05:41:36.350 --> 05:41:36.360 align:start position:0%
guess they're considered homeschool
 
05:41:38.070 --> 05:41:38.080 align:start position:0%
because you have to declare that status
 
05:41:42.310 --> 05:41:42.320 align:start position:0%
but those pods have grown and grown and
 
05:41:44.390 --> 05:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
they're meeting a diverse need of
 
05:41:45.868 --> 05:41:45.878 align:start position:0%
students and you just heard from the
 
05:41:48.750 --> 05:41:48.760 align:start position:0%
last student I wanted to share with you
 
05:41:51.510 --> 05:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
a quote from Mike mcshain of Forbes
 
05:41:53.708 --> 05:41:53.718 align:start position:0%
Magazine here's to the kids in the
 
05:41:56.310 --> 05:41:56.320 align:start position:0%
banana costumes which Fe featured a
 
05:41:58.110 --> 05:41:58.120 align:start position:0%
progressive and real discussion of the
 
05:42:00.030 --> 05:42:00.040 align:start position:0%
challenges in education helping kids
 
05:42:02.910 --> 05:42:02.920 align:start position:0%
find Solutions I can think of few better
 
05:42:05.468 --> 05:42:05.478 align:start position:0%
metaphors he says visual metaphors for
 
05:42:07.070 --> 05:42:07.080 align:start position:0%
micro schools and other Alternative
 
05:42:09.230 --> 05:42:09.240 align:start position:0%
Learning environments than a happy child
 
05:42:10.628 --> 05:42:10.638 align:start position:0%
in a banana
 
05:42:12.868 --> 05:42:12.878 align:start position:0%
costume I'll have you know that was my
 
05:42:14.830 --> 05:42:14.840 align:start position:0%
child in the banana costume who has
 
05:42:17.110 --> 05:42:17.120 align:start position:0%
autism I'll be happy to forward you that
 
05:42:21.670 --> 05:42:21.680 align:start position:0%
article he was one of two uh um post um
 
05:42:23.868 --> 05:42:23.878 align:start position:0%
publicists that put out an article about
 
05:42:25.670 --> 05:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
this being the way of the future and
 
05:42:27.670 --> 05:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
that we cannot continue to try to solve
 
05:42:30.270 --> 05:42:30.280 align:start position:0%
the same problems the same way
 
05:42:33.110 --> 05:42:33.120 align:start position:0%
so for many per perfectly reasonable uh
 
05:42:35.070 --> 05:42:35.080 align:start position:0%
reasons traditional schools can't
 
05:42:36.390 --> 05:42:36.400 align:start position:0%
accommodate someone who wants to wear a
 
05:42:38.990 --> 05:42:39.000 align:start position:0%
banana costume right I mean that's not
 
05:42:40.270 --> 05:42:40.280 align:start position:0%
something you can go to work in your
 
05:42:42.548 --> 05:42:42.558 align:start position:0%
banana costume um but there are students
 
05:42:45.230 --> 05:42:45.240 align:start position:0%
who need to have a more orderly
 
05:42:47.590 --> 05:42:47.600 align:start position:0%
distraction free learning environment um
 
05:42:49.510 --> 05:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
there are some in the banana suit or not
 
05:42:52.350 --> 05:42:52.360 align:start position:0%
who don't neatly fit in the box and one
 
05:42:54.390 --> 05:42:54.400 align:start position:0%
flavor we've allowed those with most
 
05:42:56.670 --> 05:42:56.680 align:start position:0%
potential and most vulnerable isn't
 
05:42:58.830 --> 05:42:58.840 align:start position:0%
working I'll also note that these are
 
05:43:01.510 --> 05:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
not kids who take any standardized tests
 
05:43:03.868 --> 05:43:03.878 align:start position:0%
well nor do these tests provide any
 
05:43:06.030 --> 05:43:06.040 align:start position:0%
tangible help to them directly in their
 
05:43:06.040 --> 05:43:07.270 align:start position:0%
tangible help to them directly in their
educational

05:43:07.270 --> 05:43:07.280 align:start position:0%
educational
 
05:43:09.350 --> 05:43:09.360 align:start position:0%
Journey there are many reasons why these
 
05:43:11.270 --> 05:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
kids need other options from the article
 
05:43:13.070 --> 05:43:13.080 align:start position:0%
Logan's twin sister was bullied in her
 
05:43:15.110 --> 05:43:15.120 align:start position:0%
old school and said as well of her new
 
05:43:17.230 --> 05:43:17.240 align:start position:0%
environment it's calmer here no one is
 
05:43:19.788 --> 05:43:19.798 align:start position:0%
making fun of me as Mike McShan said in
 
05:43:21.310 --> 05:43:21.320 align:start position:0%
the article if that doesn't break your
 
05:43:23.910 --> 05:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
heart I don't know what to tell
 
05:43:26.430 --> 05:43:26.440 align:start position:0%
you if you do the math the options are
 
05:43:29.070 --> 05:43:29.080 align:start position:0%
not a takeaway I've testified many times
 
05:43:31.628 --> 05:43:31.638 align:start position:0%
s before about inefficiencies caused by
 
05:43:34.310 --> 05:43:34.320 align:start position:0%
federal Ida law which leads to more
 
05:43:36.708 --> 05:43:36.718 align:start position:0%
expensive customers of our Public School
 
05:43:38.830 --> 05:43:38.840 align:start position:0%
System including in my own town where we
 
05:43:40.868 --> 05:43:40.878 align:start position:0%
have many outof district placements
 
05:43:42.548 --> 05:43:42.558 align:start position:0%
these are some of the most expensive
 
05:43:44.510 --> 05:43:44.520 align:start position:0%
placements that we have and there are
 
05:43:46.910 --> 05:43:46.920 align:start position:0%
options available as I mentioned going
 
05:43:49.190 --> 05:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
to my town and saying hey you know you
 
05:43:50.708 --> 05:43:50.718 align:start position:0%
have these other options you can route
 
05:43:53.350 --> 05:43:53.360 align:start position:0%
these students this other
 
05:43:55.270 --> 05:43:55.280 align:start position:0%
direction so just as you wouldn't
 
05:43:56.868 --> 05:43:56.878 align:start position:0%
continue to do something inefficient in
 
05:43:59.110 --> 05:43:59.120 align:start position:0%
your household it doesn't make sense to
 
05:44:01.548 --> 05:44:01.558 align:start position:0%
it here either no amount of Band-Aids or
 
05:44:03.190 --> 05:44:03.200 align:start position:0%
IEP documents will fix a simple
 
05:44:05.110 --> 05:44:05.120 align:start position:0%
situation that can be addressed by
 
05:44:07.868 --> 05:44:07.878 align:start position:0%
saying if the plant does not flower
 
05:44:11.070 --> 05:44:11.080 align:start position:0%
don't fix it change its
 
05:44:13.310 --> 05:44:13.320 align:start position:0%
environment and I can tell you that the
 
05:44:16.430 --> 05:44:16.440 align:start position:0%
children who have through the pandemic
 
05:44:18.628 --> 05:44:18.638 align:start position:0%
challenges found their way to these
 
05:44:21.468 --> 05:44:21.478 align:start position:0%
alternative paths are thriving and they
 
05:44:25.070 --> 05:44:25.080 align:start position:0%
are not Republican children they are not
 
05:44:26.868 --> 05:44:26.878 align:start position:0%
Democrat children they are our children
 
05:44:29.430 --> 05:44:29.440 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire all of our children
 
05:44:31.270 --> 05:44:31.280 align:start position:0%
this creates opportunity and you heard
 
05:44:33.110 --> 05:44:33.120 align:start position:0%
from the gentleman earlier it wouldn't
 
05:44:35.430 --> 05:44:35.440 align:start position:0%
do much for that but I I beg to differ
 
05:44:37.270 --> 05:44:37.280 align:start position:0%
that it creates space to fairly address
 
05:44:38.868 --> 05:44:38.878 align:start position:0%
the mainstream children who are
 
05:44:40.910 --> 05:44:40.920 align:start position:0%
expanding past the brick building faster
 
05:44:43.110 --> 05:44:43.120 align:start position:0%
than we can address it's the right thing
 
05:44:45.230 --> 05:44:45.240 align:start position:0%
to do and Innovation generally creates
 
05:44:45.240 --> 05:44:46.670 align:start position:0%
to do and Innovation generally creates
positive

05:44:46.670 --> 05:44:46.680 align:start position:0%
positive
 
05:44:49.190 --> 05:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
outcomes the opposite of that holds back
 
05:44:51.310 --> 05:44:51.320 align:start position:0%
children holds back families who
 
05:44:54.468 --> 05:44:54.478 align:start position:0%
experienced socioeconomic race gender
 
05:44:56.548 --> 05:44:56.558 align:start position:0%
and all kinds of bias I mean these are
 
05:44:59.350 --> 05:44:59.360 align:start position:0%
our students who need gender affirmation
 
05:45:01.788 --> 05:45:01.798 align:start position:0%
I'm speaking directly in terms of
 
05:45:03.430 --> 05:45:03.440 align:start position:0%
children that I know that are part of
 
05:45:05.708 --> 05:45:05.718 align:start position:0%
our school and these are students that
 
05:45:07.390 --> 05:45:07.400 align:start position:0%
could not remain in the mainstream
 
05:45:08.830 --> 05:45:08.840 align:start position:0%
because they were not in a gender
 
05:45:08.840 --> 05:45:11.788 align:start position:0%
because they were not in a gender
affirming

05:45:11.788 --> 05:45:11.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:14.390 --> 05:45:14.400 align:start position:0%
environment it seeks to hold them down I
 
05:45:16.868 --> 05:45:16.878 align:start position:0%
don't think this committee is about that
 
05:45:18.590 --> 05:45:18.600 align:start position:0%
again going back to when the human in
 
05:45:20.910 --> 05:45:20.920 align:start position:0%
you sees the human in me with my shaky
 
05:45:23.670 --> 05:45:23.680 align:start position:0%
voice and all we can make progress I
 
05:45:25.868 --> 05:45:25.878 align:start position:0%
know we can I know we've done it in the
 
05:45:27.310 --> 05:45:27.320 align:start position:0%
past so let's do the right thing New
 
05:45:29.628 --> 05:45:29.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire let's move these EFA bills
 
05:45:32.430 --> 05:45:32.440 align:start position:0%
forward and stop putting limitations
 
05:45:35.548 --> 05:45:35.558 align:start position:0%
where not needed thank you thank you are
 
05:45:37.830 --> 05:45:37.840 align:start position:0%
there any questions from the committee
 
05:45:40.230 --> 05:45:40.240 align:start position:0%
yes represent cordelli thank you uh
 
05:45:42.230 --> 05:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
thank you michay for being here welcome
 
05:45:45.788 --> 05:45:45.798 align:start position:0%
back um as I recall in the past you've
 
05:45:47.590 --> 05:45:47.600 align:start position:0%
testified on a number of special
 
05:45:50.590 --> 05:45:50.600 align:start position:0%
education bills I I think maybe one or
 
05:45:52.910 --> 05:45:52.920 align:start position:0%
two of your children have had
 
05:45:57.628 --> 05:45:57.638 align:start position:0%
IEPs um are where are they um thank you
 
05:46:00.468 --> 05:46:00.478 align:start position:0%
um uh where are they these days are they
 
05:46:02.708 --> 05:46:02.718 align:start position:0%
in one of the pods that you mentioned
 
05:46:04.868 --> 05:46:04.878 align:start position:0%
they are thank you for that so two of
 
05:46:08.468 --> 05:46:08.478 align:start position:0%
mine went to a VX route they needed the
 
05:46:10.070 --> 05:46:10.080 align:start position:0%
pressure off in the environment and they
 
05:46:12.350 --> 05:46:12.360 align:start position:0%
are excelling and for all those that
 
05:46:15.750 --> 05:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
knock VX it's an amazing program of many
 
05:46:17.670 --> 05:46:17.680 align:start position:0%
times former public school teachers and
 
05:46:19.150 --> 05:46:19.160 align:start position:0%
some of them actually are existing
 
05:46:20.788 --> 05:46:20.798 align:start position:0%
Public School teachers so they are
 
05:46:22.310 --> 05:46:22.320 align:start position:0%
thriving they're actually preparing as
 
05:46:24.628 --> 05:46:24.638 align:start position:0%
14-y olds to consider what their careers
 
05:46:26.430 --> 05:46:26.440 align:start position:0%
are going to be and what college path
 
05:46:28.190 --> 05:46:28.200 align:start position:0%
they're going to follow and they have
 
05:46:29.830 --> 05:46:29.840 align:start position:0%
regular inter interactions with teachers
 
05:46:31.390 --> 05:46:31.400 align:start position:0%
they have to have the collaborations
 
05:46:33.430 --> 05:46:33.440 align:start position:0%
with other students there's even a
 
05:46:35.468 --> 05:46:35.478 align:start position:0%
homeschool kickball group that we joined
 
05:46:38.030 --> 05:46:38.040 align:start position:0%
this year that has all ages and you know
 
05:46:39.590 --> 05:46:39.600 align:start position:0%
what all these kids that never got the
 
05:46:41.230 --> 05:46:41.240 align:start position:0%
chance to play kickball they're out
 
05:46:43.708 --> 05:46:43.718 align:start position:0%
there playing kickball and the younger
 
05:46:47.868 --> 05:46:47.878 align:start position:0%
two are part of a pipod which has grown
 
05:46:49.350 --> 05:46:49.360 align:start position:0%
exponentially and they've done
 
05:46:50.708 --> 05:46:50.718 align:start position:0%
exceptionally well and went from a
 
05:46:53.150 --> 05:46:53.160 align:start position:0%
10-year-old not reading to reading off
 
05:46:55.750 --> 05:46:55.760 align:start position:0%
the charts to making a friend with
 
05:46:57.628 --> 05:46:57.638 align:start position:0%
someone in India that I have to tell
 
05:46:59.548 --> 05:46:59.558 align:start position:0%
them okay you can't be talking to your
 
05:47:00.830 --> 05:47:00.840 align:start position:0%
friend in India in the middle of the
 
05:47:03.468 --> 05:47:03.478 align:start position:0%
night um it's opened all kinds of doors
 
05:47:06.030 --> 05:47:06.040 align:start position:0%
that I wouldn't have imagined uh and and
 
05:47:07.910 --> 05:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
I will tell you I was probably having
 
05:47:09.150 --> 05:47:09.160 align:start position:0%
been the child of a public school
 
05:47:10.750 --> 05:47:10.760 align:start position:0%
teacher and I have two sisters there
 
05:47:12.990 --> 05:47:13.000 align:start position:0%
public school teachers probably a a
 
05:47:15.670 --> 05:47:15.680 align:start position:0%
pretty strong critic of what I thought
 
05:47:18.468 --> 05:47:18.478 align:start position:0%
alternative schooling was it flipped
 
05:47:20.310 --> 05:47:20.320 align:start position:0%
everything upside down for our family
 
05:47:22.350 --> 05:47:22.360 align:start position:0%
and we are no longer struggling six
 
05:47:25.548 --> 05:47:25.558 align:start position:0%
years of family court was it wasn't
 
05:47:27.230 --> 05:47:27.240 align:start position:0%
needed we didn't need that if we could
 
05:47:29.670 --> 05:47:29.680 align:start position:0%
have found a path sooner we didn't have
 
05:47:31.548 --> 05:47:31.558 align:start position:0%
to struggle into Che your point we had
 
05:47:34.868 --> 05:47:34.878 align:start position:0%
IEPs that were about this thick High and
 
05:47:36.910 --> 05:47:36.920 align:start position:0%
the inefficiency that that caused the
 
05:47:39.270 --> 05:47:39.280 align:start position:0%
school district and the teachers I would
 
05:47:40.628 --> 05:47:40.638 align:start position:0%
look them in the eye and there would be
 
05:47:42.830 --> 05:47:42.840 align:start position:0%
10 of them and one of me and they would
 
05:47:45.468 --> 05:47:45.478 align:start position:0%
want to tell me that this was just
 
05:47:47.628 --> 05:47:47.638 align:start position:0%
miserable and we can see that through
 
05:47:49.788 --> 05:47:49.798 align:start position:0%
the droves that have left so long story
 
05:47:51.230 --> 05:47:51.240 align:start position:0%
short they're
 
05:47:53.190 --> 05:47:53.200 align:start position:0%
thriving you know there're are teachers
 
05:47:54.468 --> 05:47:54.478 align:start position:0%
who are finding their ways to other
 
05:47:55.750 --> 05:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
options if they don't like the
 
05:47:57.190 --> 05:47:57.200 align:start position:0%
mainstream option they can find an
 
05:47:59.190 --> 05:47:59.200 align:start position:0%
option too so this isn't just for k it's
 
05:48:02.030 --> 05:48:02.040 align:start position:0%
it's for everybody so thank you thank
 
05:48:03.548 --> 05:48:03.558 align:start position:0%

05:48:14.390 --> 05:48:14.400 align:start position:0%
1561 and we'll move to the last bill of
 
05:48:15.910 --> 05:48:15.920 align:start position:0%

income eligibility cap from 30 50% to U
 
05:49:37.510 --> 05:49:37.520 align:start position:0%
500% and um it struck me uh yesterday
 
05:49:41.110 --> 05:49:41.120 align:start position:0%
during testimony on one of the um one of
 
05:49:42.708 --> 05:49:42.718 align:start position:0%
the um food
 
05:49:44.708 --> 05:49:44.718 align:start position:0%
meals um
 
05:49:47.390 --> 05:49:47.400 align:start position:0%
bills where I think it was uh the lady
 
05:49:54.190 --> 05:49:54.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:58.190 --> 05:49:58.200 align:start position:0%
um income does not take expenses into
 
05:49:59.670 --> 05:49:59.680 align:start position:0%
account when they were looking to
 
05:50:03.750 --> 05:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
increase the cap on their program and I
 
05:50:06.628 --> 05:50:06.638 align:start position:0%
agree completely I was uh I've been on
 
05:50:09.510 --> 05:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
the phone recently a number of times
 
05:50:12.510 --> 05:50:12.520 align:start position:0%
with a mom from um
 
05:50:15.830 --> 05:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
Swansea whose husband works for the
 
05:50:19.150 --> 05:50:19.160 align:start position:0%
state of New York and commutes to uh
 
05:50:22.750 --> 05:50:22.760 align:start position:0%
Albany um three days a week uh he makes
 
05:50:25.310 --> 05:50:25.320 align:start position:0%
a very good salary about
 
05:50:27.628 --> 05:50:27.638 align:start position:0%
$150,000 but she was telling me you
 
05:50:30.390 --> 05:50:30.400 align:start position:0%
can't believe the expenses the expenses
 
05:50:34.590 --> 05:50:34.600 align:start position:0%
of the travel over to Aly um all the
 
05:50:36.830 --> 05:50:36.840 align:start position:0%
other expenses they have related to that
 
05:50:39.948 --> 05:50:39.958 align:start position:0%
but he wants to stay in his job there uh
 
05:50:42.190 --> 05:50:42.200 align:start position:0%
for his retirement
 
05:50:44.948 --> 05:50:44.958 align:start position:0%
system and I can
 
05:50:49.310 --> 05:50:49.320 align:start position:0%
um imagine why he wants to do that um
 
05:50:53.590 --> 05:50:53.600 align:start position:0%
but the 500% income
 
05:50:57.190 --> 05:50:57.200 align:start position:0%
cap according to n excuse me
 
05:50:58.990 --> 05:50:59.000 align:start position:0%

05:51:39.320 --> 05:51:42.510 align:start position:0%
median
income

05:51:42.510 --> 05:51:42.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:42.520 --> 05:51:54.830 align:start position:0%
 
135,136

05:51:54.830 --> 05:51:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:54.840 --> 05:51:56.590 align:start position:0%
 
per.

05:51:56.590 --> 05:51:56.600 align:start position:0%
per.
 
05:51:58.830 --> 05:51:58.840 align:start position:0%
and median
 
05:52:01.868 --> 05:52:01.878 align:start position:0%
if you put them all on a ranking medium
 
05:52:04.990 --> 05:52:05.000 align:start position:0%
is the mid midpoint so we're at the
 
05:52:09.070 --> 05:52:09.080 align:start position:0%
midpoint of family income with this
 
05:52:11.590 --> 05:52:11.600 align:start position:0%
increase to
 
05:52:11.600 --> 05:52:13.110 align:start position:0%
increase to
500%

05:52:13.110 --> 05:52:13.120 align:start position:0%
500%
 
05:52:17.230 --> 05:52:17.240 align:start position:0%
so there's a many below and we're
 
05:52:19.990 --> 05:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
dealing with the lower income uh
 
05:52:22.350 --> 05:52:22.360 align:start position:0%
families still because they're below the
 
05:52:26.430 --> 05:52:26.440 align:start position:0%
median or right at the median income for
 
05:52:28.830 --> 05:52:28.840 align:start position:0%
a family of their size
 
05:52:33.510 --> 05:52:33.520 align:start position:0%
so um that is why I chose the
 
05:52:37.548 --> 05:52:37.558 align:start position:0%
500% uh level um as uh I thought a
 
05:52:40.750 --> 05:52:40.760 align:start position:0%
reasonable and valid uh family income
 
05:52:44.270 --> 05:52:44.280 align:start position:0%
cap um with all due respect to
 
05:52:48.390 --> 05:52:48.400 align:start position:0%
representative lak's bill um but uh that
 
05:52:50.948 --> 05:52:50.958 align:start position:0%
was my reasoning for choosing the 500%
 
05:52:53.190 --> 05:52:53.200 align:start position:0%
level and I think the committee thank
 
05:52:54.708 --> 05:52:54.718 align:start position:0%
you very much are you willing to take
 
05:52:57.150 --> 05:52:57.160 align:start position:0%
questions sure are there any questions
 
05:52:59.670 --> 05:52:59.680 align:start position:0%
from the committee yes representa Miler

poverty guidelines for
 
05:53:15.270 --> 05:53:15.280 align:start position:0%
2022 um for a family of two at 500% it
 
05:53:15.280 --> 05:53:16.430 align:start position:0%
2022 um for a family of two at 500% it
is

05:53:16.430 --> 05:53:16.440 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:53:16.440 --> 05:53:18.990 align:start position:0%
is
$91,500

05:53:18.990 --> 05:53:19.000 align:start position:0%
$91,500
 
05:53:27.150 --> 05:53:27.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:28.868 --> 05:53:28.878 align:start position:0%
$87,200 would you like the family of
 
05:53:32.948 --> 05:53:32.958 align:start position:0%
four also please sure uh family of four
 
05:53:35.670 --> 05:53:35.680 align:start position:0%

500% is
$38,750

05:53:37.708 --> 05:53:37.718 align:start position:0%
$38,750
 
05:53:40.708 --> 05:53:40.718 align:start position:0%
and the median income
 
05:53:40.718 --> 05:53:46.030 align:start position:0%
and the median income
$135

05:53:46.030 --> 05:53:46.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:48.750 --> 05:53:48.760 align:start position:0%
833 follow up yes go ahead so then what
 
05:53:52.868 --> 05:53:52.878 align:start position:0%
would be the 500% what were your figures
 
05:53:56.948 --> 05:53:56.958 align:start position:0%
there that that is the 500 that was 500%
 
05:54:00.708 --> 05:54:00.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:04.030 --> 05:54:04.040 align:start position:0%
100% further questions representor
 
05:54:07.948 --> 05:54:07.958 align:start position:0%
Tanner thank you um do you have any idea
 
05:54:10.708 --> 05:54:10.718 align:start position:0%
why the legislative budget office can't
 
05:54:13.430 --> 05:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
come up with fiscal notes on something
 
05:54:18.030 --> 05:54:18.040 align:start position:0%
like this um where you have the the the
 
05:54:20.350 --> 05:54:20.360 align:start position:0%
definitely above my pay grade level but
 
05:54:21.628 --> 05:54:21.638 align:start position:0%
you have the
 
05:54:23.868 --> 05:54:23.878 align:start position:0%
statistics um yeah I I didn't get these
 
05:54:28.150 --> 05:54:28.160 align:start position:0%
statistics from them um uh I I know that
 
05:54:30.190 --> 05:54:30.200 align:start position:0%
they're busy working on a number of
 
05:54:32.350 --> 05:54:32.360 align:start position:0%
projects I know uh I think they're right
 
05:54:34.750 --> 05:54:34.760 align:start position:0%
now working on a special education uh
 
05:54:37.708 --> 05:54:37.718 align:start position:0%
performance audit also uh so I'm I'm not
 
05:54:40.990 --> 05:54:41.000 align:start position:0%
sure um the the timing and the a number
 
05:54:44.030 --> 05:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
of uh projects they're working
 
05:54:49.468 --> 05:54:49.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:53.070 --> 05:54:53.080 align:start position:0%
leus those who are at that median level
 
05:54:56.590 --> 05:54:56.600 align:start position:0%
do they qualify for other scholarships
 
05:54:59.190 --> 05:54:59.200 align:start position:0%
do you know that would help them to
 
05:54:59.200 --> 05:55:00.868 align:start position:0%
do you know that would help them to
afford

05:55:00.868 --> 05:55:00.878 align:start position:0%
afford
 
05:55:04.670 --> 05:55:04.680 align:start position:0%
a private or other school to for their
 
05:55:07.868 --> 05:55:07.878 align:start position:0%
children um well they would not qualify
 
05:55:10.628 --> 05:55:10.638 align:start position:0%
for the tax credit scholarship program
 
05:55:12.948 --> 05:55:12.958 align:start position:0%
uh but there are many private schools
 
05:55:15.670 --> 05:55:15.680 align:start position:0%
Catholic schools um non-religious
 
05:55:18.030 --> 05:55:18.040 align:start position:0%
private schools that offer scholarships
 
05:55:21.310 --> 05:55:21.320 align:start position:0%
to students a great many um EFA students
 
05:55:24.590 --> 05:55:24.600 align:start position:0%
who go to private schools um get a
 
05:55:28.070 --> 05:55:28.080 align:start position:0%
scholarship um from that that school um
 
05:55:30.590 --> 05:55:30.600 align:start position:0%
um I believe I read a year or two ago
 
05:55:34.868 --> 05:55:34.878 align:start position:0%
that the um average cost in a for a
 
05:55:36.590 --> 05:55:36.600 align:start position:0%
Catholic elementary school was something
 
05:55:41.190 --> 05:55:41.200 align:start position:0%
in the $8,000 price range um for tuition
 
05:55:43.830 --> 05:55:43.840 align:start position:0%
and um again you could get a scholarship
 
05:55:47.468 --> 05:55:47.478 align:start position:0%
on top of the EFA even for those who are
 
05:55:51.670 --> 05:55:51.680 align:start position:0%
at the middle at the mid-range the
 
05:55:54.430 --> 05:55:54.440 align:start position:0%
500% uh I haven't asked anyone in a
 
05:55:56.830 --> 05:55:56.840 align:start position:0%
private school about the 500% level but
 
05:56:00.030 --> 05:56:00.040 align:start position:0%
uh um yeah okay thank you further
 
05:56:01.270 --> 05:56:01.280 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee yes
 
05:56:03.868 --> 05:56:03.878 align:start position:0%
representative Pell thank you Mr chair
 
05:56:05.390 --> 05:56:05.400 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question did
 
05:56:07.948 --> 05:56:07.958 align:start position:0%
you just say that the tuition at a
 
05:56:10.788 --> 05:56:10.798 align:start position:0%
Catholic school was $8,000 and correct
 
05:56:13.350 --> 05:56:13.360 align:start position:0%
me if I'm wrong but our it cost about
 
05:56:16.948 --> 05:56:16.958 align:start position:0%
$20,000 to educate a student um publicly
 
05:56:20.548 --> 05:56:20.558 align:start position:0%
in new I I believe a couple of years ago
 
05:56:21.990 --> 05:56:22.000 align:start position:0%
that was the number that was quoted to
 
05:56:24.670 --> 05:56:24.680 align:start position:0%
me for a Catholic Elementary
 
05:56:26.868 --> 05:56:26.878 align:start position:0%
School further
 
05:56:26.878 --> 05:56:28.510 align:start position:0%
School further
questions

05:56:28.510 --> 05:56:28.520 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:56:30.750 --> 05:56:30.760 align:start position:0%
not see thank you very much oh
 
05:56:34.030 --> 05:56:34.040 align:start position:0%
representa D thank you I'm actually not
 
05:56:35.868 --> 05:56:35.878 align:start position:0%
sure whether this question is for
 
05:56:37.868 --> 05:56:37.878 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli or you chair lad
 
05:56:40.948 --> 05:56:40.958 align:start position:0%
or both but appr propo of the lack of
 
05:56:45.070 --> 05:56:45.080 align:start position:0%
fiscal note the statement attached to
 
05:56:48.110 --> 05:56:48.120 align:start position:0%
the bill says that the LBA can't do it
 
05:56:49.628 --> 05:56:49.638 align:start position:0%
because they don't have the data they
 
05:56:53.070 --> 05:56:53.080 align:start position:0%
need from doe so can we exert some
 
05:56:54.430 --> 05:56:54.440 align:start position:0%
leverage on
 
05:56:58.110 --> 05:56:58.120 align:start position:0%
doe and not just on this fiscal note
 
05:56:59.910 --> 05:56:59.920 align:start position:0%
well I think that they're probably doing
 
05:57:03.430 --> 05:57:03.440 align:start position:0%
fiscal notes for criminal justice for
 
05:57:05.990 --> 05:57:06.000 align:start position:0%
education for transportation you know
 
05:57:08.110 --> 05:57:08.120 align:start position:0%
not doe but all these folks but they all
 
05:57:11.070 --> 05:57:11.080 align:start position:0%
go through LBA but LBA has to get the
 
05:57:13.590 --> 05:57:13.600 align:start position:0%
data first I I know it and when we're
 
05:57:17.030 --> 05:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
talking about 49 bills that we have
 
05:57:19.590 --> 05:57:19.600 align:start position:0%
alone they're trying to carve them out
 
05:57:22.868 --> 05:57:22.878 align:start position:0%
and actually I I feel that we've gotten
 
05:57:25.150 --> 05:57:25.160 align:start position:0%
some fiscal notes this year that we
 
05:57:27.830 --> 05:57:27.840 align:start position:0%
hadn't gotten any in the previous year
 
05:57:29.390 --> 05:57:29.400 align:start position:0%
so I I would say they're a little bit
 
05:57:32.110 --> 05:57:32.120 align:start position:0%
ahead of the game I know that uh Mark
 
05:57:34.150 --> 05:57:34.160 align:start position:0%
and Caitlyn and Company are trying to do
 
05:57:36.430 --> 05:57:36.440 align:start position:0%
that and they know we're looking for
 
05:57:39.548 --> 05:57:39.558 align:start position:0%
this stuff unfortunately our date to get
 
05:57:42.868 --> 05:57:42.878 align:start position:0%
some of this out is in a couple weeks
 
05:57:42.878 --> 05:57:45.350 align:start position:0%
some of this out is in a couple weeks
February

05:57:45.350 --> 05:57:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:48.150 --> 05:57:48.160 align:start position:0%
15 further further questions of
 
05:57:49.548 --> 05:57:49.558 align:start position:0%
Representative cordelli yes
 
05:57:51.990 --> 05:57:52.000 align:start position:0%

school note would say or is it more does
 
05:58:03.030 --> 05:58:03.040 align:start position:0%
it matter how high or low or whatever in

your in terms of no I'm I'm I'm trying
 
05:58:08.708 --> 05:58:08.718 align:start position:0%
to do what I think is right with this
 
05:58:11.708 --> 05:58:11.718 align:start position:0%
bill so it doesn't matter the cost thank
 
05:58:15.788 --> 05:58:15.798 align:start position:0%
you further questions i' representa
 
05:58:18.788 --> 05:58:18.798 align:start position:0%

question along uh representative Hall's
 
05:58:25.430 --> 05:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
questioning um last year we looked at
 
05:58:28.390 --> 05:58:28.400 align:start position:0%
the bill and we Rose we just just raised
 
05:58:31.350 --> 05:58:31.360 align:start position:0%
it up to 350 and now we're looking at
 
05:58:34.750 --> 05:58:34.760 align:start position:0%
500 and you say that you just want to do
 
05:58:36.830 --> 05:58:36.840 align:start position:0%
what's right what's are we going to be
 
05:58:42.270 --> 05:58:42.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:44.830 --> 05:58:44.840 align:start position:0%
year are you suggesting legislation for
 
05:58:46.708 --> 05:58:46.718 align:start position:0%
next year
 
05:58:49.270 --> 05:58:49.280 align:start position:0%
already no I'm just questioning the tent
 
05:58:53.868 --> 05:58:53.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:55.990 --> 05:58:56.000 align:start position:0%
end perhaps that would be a question for
 
05:59:00.390 --> 05:59:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:02.830 --> 05:59:02.840 align:start position:0%

being implemented if I'm not mistaken
 
05:59:33.430 --> 05:59:33.440 align:start position:0%
from a year or two ago
 
05:59:36.390 --> 05:59:36.400 align:start position:0%
oh welcome Barrett thank you uh thank
 
05:59:38.150 --> 05:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
you chairman L good afternoon um members
 
05:59:39.788 --> 05:59:39.798 align:start position:0%
of the committee um I wasn't going to
 
05:59:41.830 --> 05:59:41.840 align:start position:0%
testify but representative pel you seem
 
05:59:43.750 --> 05:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
very surprised that the cost of a
 
05:59:45.830 --> 05:59:45.840 align:start position:0%
Catholic Elementary School is $88,000
 
05:59:47.548 --> 05:59:47.558 align:start position:0%
per year well the cost of a public
 
05:59:49.788 --> 05:59:49.798 align:start position:0%
school education is about $20,000 per
 
05:59:51.990 --> 05:59:52.000 align:start position:0%
year um I presume you also know why that
 
05:59:53.548 --> 05:59:53.558 align:start position:0%
may be but in case anybody on the
 
05:59:55.670 --> 05:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
committee is confused um Catholic
 
05:59:57.030 --> 05:59:57.040 align:start position:0%
schools are not providing special
 
05:59:58.948 --> 05:59:58.958 align:start position:0%
education services to the extent that
 
06:00:00.750 --> 06:00:00.760 align:start position:0%
public schools are doing them when a
 
06:00:02.390 --> 06:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
child needs an out of District placement
 
06:00:03.910 --> 06:00:03.920 align:start position:0%
it is not the church that's paying for
 
06:00:07.190 --> 06:00:07.200 align:start position:0%
that it's the public schools um likewise
 
06:00:09.230 --> 06:00:09.240 align:start position:0%
um uh as members of the committee may
 
06:00:12.868 --> 06:00:12.878 align:start position:0%
know um uh the state of New Hampshire um
 
06:00:15.788 --> 06:00:15.798 align:start position:0%
has routinely cut all funding from the
 
06:00:17.190 --> 06:00:17.200 align:start position:0%
uh from the New Hampshire retirement
 
06:00:19.548 --> 06:00:19.558 align:start position:0%
system they used to pay a portion of the
 
06:00:21.030 --> 06:00:21.040 align:start position:0%
fees that locals had to pay to the
 
06:00:23.110 --> 06:00:23.120 align:start position:0%
retirement system they cut that back in
 
06:00:25.708 --> 06:00:25.718 align:start position:0%
2013 if we want to run through the
 
06:00:27.510 --> 06:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
expenses the public schools are
 
06:00:29.948 --> 06:00:29.958 align:start position:0%
obligated to meet versus the the the
 
06:00:31.628 --> 06:00:31.638 align:start position:0%
expenses that private schools choose to
 
06:00:33.590 --> 06:00:33.600 align:start position:0%
meet um our public schools and our
 
06:00:35.070 --> 06:00:35.080 align:start position:0%
school boards all happy to do that we'll
 
06:00:36.670 --> 06:00:36.680 align:start position:0%
do that any day of the week if there are
 
06:00:38.750 --> 06:00:38.760 align:start position:0%
any questions relative to that point or
 
06:00:40.910 --> 06:00:40.920 align:start position:0%
the bill in general or vouchers I'm
 
06:00:42.628 --> 06:00:42.638 align:start position:0%
happy to answer
 
06:00:46.270 --> 06:00:46.280 align:start position:0%
them are there questions of the new
 
06:00:49.350 --> 06:00:49.360 align:start position:0%
Schoolboard Association represent leas
 
06:00:50.990 --> 06:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
could you get us that information I
 
06:00:52.708 --> 06:00:52.718 align:start position:0%
would appreciate it thank you very I
 
06:00:54.190 --> 06:00:54.200 align:start position:0%
don't know if I can get that for for
 
06:00:56.590 --> 06:00:56.600 align:start position:0%
private schools but I can certainly get
 
06:00:58.510 --> 06:00:58.520 align:start position:0%
a listing of all the obligations that
 
06:01:00.670 --> 06:01:00.680 align:start position:0%
public schools are required to to
 
06:01:02.430 --> 06:01:02.440 align:start position:0%
compile have you gotten the law books
 
06:01:03.788 --> 06:01:03.798 align:start position:0%
yet from from the Department of
 
06:01:06.270 --> 06:01:06.280 align:start position:0%
Education if you have the ABD the
 
06:01:08.750 --> 06:01:08.760 align:start position:0%
annotated one or the or the the the thin
 
06:01:11.708 --> 06:01:11.718 align:start position:0%
one it's somewhat annotated there you go
 
06:01:13.590 --> 06:01:13.600 align:start position:0%
I mean those are the mandates those are
 
06:01:14.910 --> 06:01:14.920 align:start position:0%
all the mandates of the things that we
 
06:01:16.590 --> 06:01:16.600 align:start position:0%
have to do representative and my
 
06:01:18.830 --> 06:01:18.840 align:start position:0%
annotated version I think they maybe
 
06:01:20.788 --> 06:01:20.798 align:start position:0%
Abridged the annotated version is
 
06:01:22.628 --> 06:01:22.638 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli and lad and
 
06:01:23.750 --> 06:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
probably Miley you know some of those
 
06:01:27.868 --> 06:01:27.878 align:start position:0%
have been 15,600 pages is right so but I
 
06:01:30.070 --> 06:01:30.080 align:start position:0%
I mean I can I mean I guess the other
 
06:01:31.510 --> 06:01:31.520 align:start position:0%
thing to do would be to you know talk to
 
06:01:32.868 --> 06:01:32.878 align:start position:0%
your business manager go through your
 
06:01:34.628 --> 06:01:34.638 align:start position:0%
local District budget and see if they
 
06:01:37.510 --> 06:01:37.520 align:start position:0%
can differentiate mandated costs versus
 
06:01:40.190 --> 06:01:40.200 align:start position:0%
sort of arbitrary costs or costs that
 
06:01:41.590 --> 06:01:41.600 align:start position:0%
that they choose to do that the voters
 
06:01:44.350 --> 06:01:44.360 align:start position:0%
are are opting to to pay for okay thank
 
06:01:46.948 --> 06:01:46.958 align:start position:0%
you because these don't give no no no
 
06:01:48.510 --> 06:01:48.520 align:start position:0%
they're just the law right they're just
 
06:01:50.310 --> 06:01:50.320 align:start position:0%
the laws right so having the costs would
 
06:01:52.310 --> 06:01:52.320 align:start position:0%
be very see what I can do than I
 
06:01:53.590 --> 06:01:53.600 align:start position:0%
certainly we have a working list of all
 
06:01:54.750 --> 06:01:54.760 align:start position:0%
the unfunded mandates that the
 
06:01:56.270 --> 06:01:56.280 align:start position:0%
legislature is passing about that would
 
06:01:59.190 --> 06:01:59.200 align:start position:0%
be awesome or so Becky so I would love
 
06:02:00.830 --> 06:02:00.840 align:start position:0%
to see that we'll send that to the
 
06:02:03.750 --> 06:02:03.760 align:start position:0%
committee as well too thank you yep
 
06:02:07.468 --> 06:02:07.478 align:start position:0%
further questions uh from the represent
 
06:02:09.910 --> 06:02:09.920 align:start position:0%
Tanner um do private schools and
 
06:02:12.390 --> 06:02:12.400 align:start position:0%
religious schools have to abide by Ada
 
06:02:18.468 --> 06:02:18.478 align:start position:0%
like uh put in um elevators or you know
 
06:02:20.510 --> 06:02:20.520 align:start position:0%
special thank you for the question ref
 
06:02:21.548 --> 06:02:21.558 align:start position:0%
I'll be honest with you I don't know
 
06:02:24.230 --> 06:02:24.240 align:start position:0%
what private schools are obligated to do
 
06:02:26.310 --> 06:02:26.320 align:start position:0%
or or federal laws that they're required
 
06:02:27.708 --> 06:02:27.718 align:start position:0%
to apply I that's something don't know
 
06:02:30.030 --> 06:02:30.040 align:start position:0%
the answer to that I I think under some
 
06:02:32.750 --> 06:02:32.760 align:start position:0%
of the municipal codes fire right that
 
06:02:35.510 --> 06:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
code health safety and at my
 
06:02:37.230 --> 06:02:37.240 align:start position:0%
understanding too that if there are I
 
06:02:38.750 --> 06:02:38.760 align:start position:0%
mean I don't want to get myself in
 
06:02:39.910 --> 06:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
trouble here if it's a quote unquote
 
06:02:41.110 --> 06:02:41.120 align:start position:0%
historic building or if there are
 
06:02:42.990 --> 06:02:43.000 align:start position:0%
significant upgrades or renovations to
 
06:02:44.270 --> 06:02:44.280 align:start position:0%
them they have to come into compliance
 
06:02:46.390 --> 06:02:46.400 align:start position:0%
with some sort of updated building codes
 
06:02:48.830 --> 06:02:48.840 align:start position:0%
but offhand Ada and whatnot I don't I
 
06:02:49.868 --> 06:02:49.878 align:start position:0%
mean you're shaking your out I believe
 
06:02:51.350 --> 06:02:51.360 align:start position:0%
you're represent I just don't the answer
 
06:02:54.830 --> 06:02:54.840 align:start position:0%
of that fur further questions from the
 
06:02:57.030 --> 06:02:57.040 align:start position:0%
committee thank you very much thank you
 
06:03:00.708 --> 06:03:00.718 align:start position:0%
you're welcome Mr chair yes can I ask a
 
06:03:05.030 --> 06:03:05.040 align:start position:0%
technical question Mr s regarding sure
 
06:03:07.430 --> 06:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
if he's willing not of you Barrett oh
 
06:03:09.830 --> 06:03:09.840 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry sure Matt
 
06:03:12.110 --> 06:03:12.120 align:start position:0%
Souther are you willing to answer a
 
06:03:12.120 --> 06:03:22.788 align:start position:0%
Souther are you willing to answer a
technical

06:03:22.788 --> 06:03:22.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:25.430 --> 06:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
question thank thank you for asking this
 
06:03:28.230 --> 06:03:28.240 align:start position:0%
I I've had this query in my own mind
 
06:03:30.670 --> 06:03:30.680 align:start position:0%
a couple of years ago for example I
 
06:03:32.510 --> 06:03:32.520 align:start position:0%
looked at the conquered Christian
 
06:03:35.788 --> 06:03:35.798 align:start position:0%
Academy and what it cost to go there
 
06:03:37.270 --> 06:03:37.280 align:start position:0%
okay and I believe and this was like
 
06:03:38.868 --> 06:03:38.878 align:start position:0%
maybe three years ago and I believe it
 
06:03:41.990 --> 06:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
was about 135 so okay it's probably now
 
06:03:45.030 --> 06:03:45.040 align:start position:0%
let's say 155 okay and a student who
 
06:03:49.110 --> 06:03:49.120 align:start position:0%
gets an EFA voucher for
 
06:03:52.548 --> 06:03:52.558 align:start position:0%
$5,300 what happens to the other 10
 
06:03:54.270 --> 06:03:54.280 align:start position:0%
that's a that's an excellent question I
 
06:03:56.590 --> 06:03:56.600 align:start position:0%
actually was not familiar with private
 
06:03:58.548 --> 06:03:58.558 align:start position:0%
schools prior to taking this position
 
06:04:00.990 --> 06:04:01.000 align:start position:0%
myself so this is a great learning
 
06:04:04.830 --> 06:04:04.840 align:start position:0%
experience for me too um students that
 
06:04:06.788 --> 06:04:06.798 align:start position:0%
need financial aid to attend these
 
06:04:09.350 --> 06:04:09.360 align:start position:0%
programs are given financial aid
 
06:04:11.990 --> 06:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
packages and essentially what happens is
 
06:04:15.190 --> 06:04:15.200 align:start position:0%
the the more affluent families subsidize
 
06:04:15.200 --> 06:04:16.628 align:start position:0%
the the more affluent families subsidize
those

06:04:16.628 --> 06:04:16.638 align:start position:0%
those
 
06:04:20.070 --> 06:04:20.080 align:start position:0%
students so they would those the the
 
06:04:21.910 --> 06:04:21.920 align:start position:0%
more affluent families would pay the
 
06:04:24.468 --> 06:04:24.478 align:start position:0%
full tuition ride and then a student
 
06:04:26.110 --> 06:04:26.120 align:start position:0%
that needs the financial aid package
 
06:04:27.110 --> 06:04:27.120 align:start position:0%
that would they would just basically
 
06:04:28.868 --> 06:04:28.878 align:start position:0%
basically they would do away with it
 
06:04:30.150 --> 06:04:30.160 align:start position:0%
right they would say we're going to give
 
06:04:33.468 --> 06:04:33.478 align:start position:0%
you $10,000 in uh you know financial aid
 
06:04:36.150 --> 06:04:36.160 align:start position:0%
and then we'll use the EFA for the 5,000
 
06:04:38.868 --> 06:04:38.878 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much and that's just
 
06:04:43.110 --> 06:04:43.120 align:start position:0%
that's just an example yeah yes um thank
 
06:04:44.750 --> 06:04:44.760 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question have you seen
 
06:04:47.750 --> 06:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
tuitions Rising lately in the private
 
06:04:50.750 --> 06:04:50.760 align:start position:0%
sector I I couldn't answer that with any
 
06:04:53.468 --> 06:04:53.478 align:start position:0%
specificity I I wouldn't know okay I
 
06:04:55.990 --> 06:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
just thought well I think the answer to
 
06:04:58.110 --> 06:04:58.120 align:start position:0%
that is yes
 
06:05:00.190 --> 06:05:00.200 align:start position:0%
it's it's definitely occurring in fact I
 
06:05:02.510 --> 06:05:02.520 align:start position:0%
can tell you the one that my grandkids
 
06:05:04.788 --> 06:05:04.798 align:start position:0%
go to it's public SL
 
06:05:07.070 --> 06:05:07.080 align:start position:0%
private and the tuition for a boarding
 
06:05:09.830 --> 06:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
student now is up close to $70,000 a
 
06:05:14.510 --> 06:05:14.520 align:start position:0%
year and the tuition is at
 
06:05:17.350 --> 06:05:17.360 align:start position:0%
$22,000 and the Catholic School within
 
06:05:20.350 --> 06:05:20.360 align:start position:0%
that particular Community is up around
 
06:05:23.030 --> 06:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
16,000 it's climbing everywhere due to
 
06:05:25.350 --> 06:05:25.360 align:start position:0%
the cost of doing
 
06:05:30.270 --> 06:05:30.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:32.708 --> 06:05:32.718 align:start position:0%
so any further
 
06:05:34.948 --> 06:05:34.958 align:start position:0%
questions thank you again thank you
 
06:05:38.230 --> 06:05:38.240 align:start position:0%
thank do we have any other cards for
 
06:05:41.030 --> 06:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
this particular bill this is
 
06:05:43.270 --> 06:05:43.280 align:start position:0%
1665 not seeing we're going to close
 
06:05:43.280 --> 06:05:44.948 align:start position:0%
