00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:57.440 align:start position:0%
okay good morning thank you everyone my
 
00:05:59.029 --> 00:05:59.039 align:start position:0%
name is kelly buchanan i'm director of
 
00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:01.039 align:start position:0%
legislative and regulatory affairs for
 
00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
clean energy new hampshire um and before
 
00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:06.080 align:start position:0%
you today there's senate bill 417 which
 
00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:08.560 align:start position:0%
is establishing a pilot program to
 
00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:10.639 align:start position:0%
examine the use of electric school buses
 
00:06:12.309 --> 00:06:12.319 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:14.080 align:start position:0%
what i will say about this bill is that
 
00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:16.160 align:start position:0%
it's it's pretty straightforward there
 
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
are some well-established guidelines in
 
00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:19.840 align:start position:0%
the bill that determine the pilot
 
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:22.560 align:start position:0%
program and partnership with
 
00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:24.800 align:start position:0%
whomever is applying that could be the
 
00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
new hampshire utilities it could be a
 
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
municipality it could be a school
 
00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:29.909 align:start position:0%
municipality it could be a school
district

00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:29.919 align:start position:0%
district
 
00:06:31.749 --> 00:06:31.759 align:start position:0%
and then we also have
 
00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:33.280 align:start position:0%
support from the department of energy as
 
00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:35.039 align:start position:0%
well as any necessary intervention by
 
00:06:37.189 --> 00:06:37.199 align:start position:0%
the public utilities commission
 
00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:38.560 align:start position:0%
the other important thing to mention
 
00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:40.800 align:start position:0%
about this bill is that it does not
 
00:06:43.029 --> 00:06:43.039 align:start position:0%
establish any funding source from the
 
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
general fund it's simply taking
 
00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
advantage of funds which are already
 
00:06:47.749 --> 00:06:47.759 align:start position:0%
available to the state
 
00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
so that would include the volkswagen
 
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:51.360 align:start position:0%
mitigation trust fund and those funds
 
00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:52.800 align:start position:0%
are currently housed at the department
 
00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
of environmental services who would play
 
00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
a pivotal role in this pilot program as
 
00:06:59.909 --> 00:06:59.919 align:start position:0%
well they really have the staff that are
 
00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
well trained enough to envision how this
 
00:07:03.749 --> 00:07:03.759 align:start position:0%
will function
 
00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:05.039 align:start position:0%
and the other source of funding that
 
00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
i'll mention is that the federal funding
 
00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:08.639 align:start position:0%
from the bipartisan infrastructure bill
 
00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:10.160 align:start position:0%
will be coming to new hampshire and
 
00:07:11.749 --> 00:07:11.759 align:start position:0%
there's quite a lot of money on the
 
00:07:13.909 --> 00:07:13.919 align:start position:0%
table and so this pilot program will
 
00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
assist new hampshire in taking advantage
 
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
of that and i believe
 
00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:20.720 align:start position:0%
the number is 17 million
 
00:07:23.589 --> 00:07:23.599 align:start position:0%
and then there's another 2.5 to 5
 
00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
billion in grant funding available so
 
00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:27.360 align:start position:0%
it's quite a lot
 
00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:28.960 align:start position:0%
and it simply enables new hampshire an
 
00:07:31.029 --> 00:07:31.039 align:start position:0%
opportunity to participate in the
 
00:07:33.029 --> 00:07:33.039 align:start position:0%
federal opportunities
 
00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:34.160 align:start position:0%
of course with all the new hampshire
 
00:07:35.909 --> 00:07:35.919 align:start position:0%
stakeholders at the table so if the
 
00:07:37.589 --> 00:07:37.599 align:start position:0%
committee has any questions regarding
 
00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:38.800 align:start position:0%
this piece of legislation i would be
 
00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:47.589 --> 00:07:47.599 align:start position:0%
thank you round chair
 
00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:50.080 align:start position:0%
anytime representative
 
00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:50.950 align:start position:0%
anytime representative
um

00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:50.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:54.469 --> 00:07:54.479 align:start position:0%
so um in this particular legislation
 
00:07:58.150 --> 00:07:58.160 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's proposing five buses at a
 
00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:00.800 align:start position:0%
cost of about a million and one point
 
00:08:03.589 --> 00:08:03.599 align:start position:0%
four million dollars is that correct
 
00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
that does sound correct to me i need to
 
00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:08.720 align:start position:0%
take a look at the full bill again but
 
00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:10.800 align:start position:0%
five buses does seem a small number but
 
00:08:12.469 --> 00:08:12.479 align:start position:0%
i feel it's appropriate to start out
 
00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
with such a number and follow up on that
 
00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
certainly um
 
00:08:21.749 --> 00:08:21.759 align:start position:0%
my my my other question is are these um
 
00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:23.440 align:start position:0%
will there be students on these buses
 
00:08:24.869 --> 00:08:24.879 align:start position:0%
will there be kids on the buses and
 
00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:27.280 align:start position:0%
what's the how do we protect them from
 
00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
these batteries bursting into flames
 
00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
so i will say yes the intention is to
 
00:08:34.709 --> 00:08:34.719 align:start position:0%
use these buses to transport students
 
00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:36.800 align:start position:0%
however i would
 
00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
point out to you that any bus that is
 
00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
used would have to go through a rigorous
 
00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:43.760 align:start position:0%
safety examination just the same as any
 
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:46.320 align:start position:0%
other bus any diesel bus that's used
 
00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
another important consideration with
 
00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:49.680 align:start position:0%
electric buses is not only are they
 
00:08:51.269 --> 00:08:51.279 align:start position:0%
quieter for students
 
00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:53.200 align:start position:0%
they're much healthier in terms of
 
00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
internal air quality in a usual
 
00:08:59.670 --> 00:08:59.680 align:start position:0%
diesel-fired bus you have high levels of
 
00:09:01.269 --> 00:09:01.279 align:start position:0%
pollution that can cause asthma and
 
00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
children and it's quite significant and
 
00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:04.150 align:start position:0%
children and it's quite significant and
so

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:04.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:06.080 align:start position:0%
the comfort and the internal air quality
 
00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
in these buses would be a large selling
 
00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:09.430 align:start position:0%
in these buses would be a large selling
point

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:09.440 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
are there other questions yes reps and
 
00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:15.509 align:start position:0%
are there other questions yes reps and
murray

00:09:15.509 --> 00:09:15.519 align:start position:0%
murray
 
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair can you speak to
 
00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
what the volkswagen money is being is it
 
00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
being used now and what's available in
 
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:23.440 align:start position:0%
the volkswagen fund
 
00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:24.800 align:start position:0%
so in terms of what's available in the
 
00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
volkswagen fund there are a couple
 
00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:28.240 align:start position:0%
different pots of money
 
00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:29.110 align:start position:0%
different pots of money
the

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:29.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:30.640 align:start position:0%
department of environmental services
 
00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
right now has an rfp out a request for
 
00:09:35.509 --> 00:09:35.519 align:start position:0%
proposal for
 
00:09:37.269 --> 00:09:37.279 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle charging infrastructure
 
00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
and that's one part of the fund
 
00:09:41.509 --> 00:09:41.519 align:start position:0%
i need to take a look and see what
 
00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
exactly from this fund could be
 
00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
delegated under the ev pilot
 
00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:47.680 align:start position:0%
exactly and that would be a really
 
00:09:49.509 --> 00:09:49.519 align:start position:0%
excellent question for becky ohler at
 
00:09:51.269 --> 00:09:51.279 align:start position:0%
the department of environmental services
 
00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:52.240 align:start position:0%
and i can
 
00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:53.680 align:start position:0%
share her contact information with the
 
00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:55.750 align:start position:0%
share her contact information with the
committee

00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:09:57.509 --> 00:09:57.519 align:start position:0%
i think there's
 
00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:00.880 align:start position:0%
i'll use a phrase lots of money
 
00:10:02.389 --> 00:10:02.399 align:start position:0%
there's quite a bit
 
00:10:04.949 --> 00:10:04.959 align:start position:0%
we're talking millions yeah it's
 
00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
multi-millions of dollars uh
 
00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
from the volkswagen settlement
 
00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:12.150 align:start position:0%
from the volkswagen settlement
okay

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:12.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
represent petrie
 
00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:17.509 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

00:10:17.509 --> 00:10:17.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
batteries especially nicole when it's 20
 
00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.030 align:start position:0%
batteries especially nicole when it's 20
below

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
below
 
00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
loses current
 
00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:24.160 align:start position:0%
how do they are they going to compensate
 
00:10:25.829 --> 00:10:25.839 align:start position:0%
for that and does it have a is it going
 
00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:27.680 align:start position:0%
to have to have a tow truck to
 
00:10:29.269 --> 00:10:29.279 align:start position:0%
bring it around afterwards or what i
 
00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
mean what's the deal
 
00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:32.240 align:start position:0%
no so it's um you know when you're
 
00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
driving an electric vehicle you it's the
 
00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:35.360 align:start position:0%
same calculus as having a tank of gas
 
00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:36.560 align:start position:0%
except we're dealing with different
 
00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
units so you're thinking about charge on
 
00:10:39.509 --> 00:10:39.519 align:start position:0%
a battery
 
00:10:39.519 --> 00:10:40.389 align:start position:0%
a battery
so

00:10:40.389 --> 00:10:40.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
these buses would be well equipped to
 
00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
handle their routes and i know when
 
00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:45.440 align:start position:0%
you're driving an ev you always have
 
00:10:47.509 --> 00:10:47.519 align:start position:0%
that buffer consideration of exactly how
 
00:10:49.509 --> 00:10:49.519 align:start position:0%
much range you have and so
 
00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
it would be quite easy to calculate the
 
00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
route of a school bus and determine
 
00:10:56.069 --> 00:10:56.079 align:start position:0%
exactly how much of a charge the bus is
 
00:10:59.430 --> 00:10:59.440 align:start position:0%
capable of and figure out that that mile
 
00:11:02.069 --> 00:11:02.079 align:start position:0%
number um with the calculation used for
 
00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
you know the lost efficiency that you do
 
00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
see in extreme cold weather and that's
 
00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
that's a real consideration
 
00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
but usually we're able to plan around
 
00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
those sorts of things
 
00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:14.320 align:start position:0%
and the bus still works fine within its
 
00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:18.230 align:start position:0%
and the bus still works fine within its
range

00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:19.829 --> 00:11:19.839 align:start position:0%
are there further questions yes
 
00:11:19.839 --> 00:11:21.269 align:start position:0%
are there further questions yes
representative

00:11:21.269 --> 00:11:21.279 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair have there been
 
00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
any calculations done for school
 
00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:29.120 align:start position:0%
districts um in terms of the cost saving
 
00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
factor by moving toward electric
 
00:11:34.069 --> 00:11:34.079 align:start position:0%
vehicles versus what they have now those
 
00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:36.640 align:start position:0%
sometimes stinky vehicles
 
00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:38.160 align:start position:0%
i don't have exact numbers in front of
 
00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
me today i apologize but i will point
 
00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:44.240 align:start position:0%
out for the committee that the
 
00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
the oyster river school district as well
 
00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:48.720 align:start position:0%
as nashua's regional planning commission
 
00:11:51.829 --> 00:11:51.839 align:start position:0%
are both in active talks with producers
 
00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
of electric school buses
 
00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:56.480 align:start position:0%
and seeking to replace their fleets
 
00:11:58.389 --> 00:11:58.399 align:start position:0%
so these buses often times over their
 
00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
lifetime are much cheaper to maintain
 
00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
when you have an ev it
 
00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:05.120 align:start position:0%
it doesn't need an oil change
 
00:12:06.629 --> 00:12:06.639 align:start position:0%
and what you're really looking at is
 
00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
just tire replacement is your only
 
00:12:10.389 --> 00:12:10.399 align:start position:0%
consistent maintenance especially with a
 
00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
lot of miles traveled so
 
00:12:14.629 --> 00:12:14.639 align:start position:0%
the cost savings would be quite enormous
 
00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
in terms of maintenance
 
00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:18.320 align:start position:0%
it's also less work for the school
 
00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:19.350 align:start position:0%
it's also less work for the school
district

00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
district
 
00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:20.230 align:start position:0%
district
they

00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:20.240 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:20.949 align:start position:0%
they
are

00:12:20.949 --> 00:12:20.959 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:12:20.959 --> 00:12:23.110 align:start position:0%
are
rather

00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
rather
 
00:12:28.629 --> 00:12:28.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead uh represent petrie thank
 
00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
you uh do they have hybrid buses if do
 
00:12:34.949 --> 00:12:34.959 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:36.880 align:start position:0%
yeah i believe there are hybrid breasts
 
00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:38.720 align:start position:0%
uh that's certainly an option out there
 
00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
this pilot program however would be just
 
00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:49.509 --> 00:12:49.519 align:start position:0%
representative turkoff thank you madam
 
00:12:49.519 --> 00:12:50.470 align:start position:0%
representative turkoff thank you madam
chair

00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
did i hear you say oyster river and
 
00:12:54.949 --> 00:12:54.959 align:start position:0%
nashua are already looking into
 
00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
electric buses that's outside of this
 
00:12:59.430 --> 00:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
pilot program they are examining that i
 
00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
know this pilot program would be of
 
00:13:02.949 --> 00:13:02.959 align:start position:0%
great assistance in terms of helping
 
00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:04.720 align:start position:0%
other school districts that are perhaps
 
00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:06.550 align:start position:0%
other school districts that are perhaps
not

00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
as fully prepared financially to take
 
00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
advantage of this piece of technology
 
00:13:13.829 --> 00:13:13.839 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking of more underserved areas
 
00:13:16.069 --> 00:13:16.079 align:start position:0%
and rural areas that may truly benefit
 
00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:17.680 align:start position:0%
in terms of improving their students
 
00:13:19.829 --> 00:13:19.839 align:start position:0%
experience on the bus as well as their
 
00:13:22.069 --> 00:13:22.079 align:start position:0%
air quality
 
00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
but just to be clear they are doing it
 
00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
outside of a pilot program they're doing
 
00:13:27.509 --> 00:13:27.519 align:start position:0%
around their own volition they are
 
00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:36.069 --> 00:13:36.079 align:start position:0%
okay any any other questions okay uh
 
00:13:39.509 --> 00:13:39.519 align:start position:0%
mickey handed out an amendment
 
00:13:39.519 --> 00:13:42.710 align:start position:0%
mickey handed out an amendment
um

00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:45.269 --> 00:13:45.279 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:48.800 align:start position:0%
basically it replaces uh
 
00:13:52.629 --> 00:13:52.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:58.150 --> 00:13:58.160 align:start position:0%
for those of us that have been around
 
00:13:59.430 --> 00:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
for a while
 
00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
you know we have the infrastructure fund
 
00:14:05.829 --> 00:14:05.839 align:start position:0%
the school infrastructure fund
 
00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:08.720 align:start position:0%
and i believe in the last budget
 
00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
we also
 
00:14:12.949 --> 00:14:12.959 align:start position:0%
included in the infrastructure fund
 
00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
the ability for schools to apply for
 
00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:19.120 align:start position:0%
that for electric school buses
 
00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
that fund
 
00:14:27.509 --> 00:14:27.519 align:start position:0%
was trying to get repurposed
 
00:14:31.829 --> 00:14:31.839 align:start position:0%
but it didn't make it and so i felt it
 
00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:33.680 align:start position:0%
was important
 
00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
let people know
 
00:14:41.269 --> 00:14:41.279 align:start position:0%
that there is money in the
 
00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:43.600 align:start position:0%
infrastructure fund to
 
00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:45.030 align:start position:0%
infrastructure fund to
support

00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
support
 
00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
electric school buses
 
00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
i think the pilot program is good
 
00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
i don't have a problem with that but i i
 
00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:54.560 align:start position:0%
just wanted to
 
00:14:58.230 --> 00:14:58.240 align:start position:0%
make sure that all funding
 
00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
would be available
 
00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
to them so
 
00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:09.189 --> 00:15:09.199 align:start position:0%
it's basically it's the last line
 
00:15:11.269 --> 00:15:11.279 align:start position:0%
that funding shall not exclude a school
 
00:15:11.279 --> 00:15:12.470 align:start position:0%
that funding shall not exclude a school
receiving

00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
receiving
 
00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
grants from the public school
 
00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:17.600 align:start position:0%
infrastructure fund established in rsa
 
00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:24.240 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm is is there anyone else out
 
00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
there that wants to talk about electric
 
00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:28.240 align:start position:0%
school buses
 
00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
thank you everyone uh yeah i
 
00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:38.880 align:start position:0%

i'm the director of the division of
 
00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:45.680 align:start position:0%
motor vehicles um i have not reviewed
 
00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
this bill i have no i have not met you
 
00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
before nice to meet you representative

to personally pass on that
 
00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
i was up at twin mountain
 
00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
which of course is the bustling
 
00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:11.680 align:start position:0%
dmv of the world
 
00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
in case you didn't know that yes
 
00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:16.880 align:start position:0%
but uh we got very good service up there
 
00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:18.880 align:start position:0%
and uh we're very
 
00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
pleased with um
 
00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
with the work that the people up there
 
00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
are doing so i'm so glad to hear that
 
00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for sharing that and i know uh
 
00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:28.720 align:start position:0%
holly and kim up there uh myself and
 
00:16:30.629 --> 00:16:30.639 align:start position:0%
jeff oberdenk we had the opportunity to
 
00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:32.320 align:start position:0%
go up there recently and they do a
 
00:16:33.749 --> 00:16:33.759 align:start position:0%
wonderful job so
 
00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:35.440 align:start position:0%
thank you representative let me just
 
00:16:37.829 --> 00:16:37.839 align:start position:0%
make a comment excuse me i love twin
 
00:16:42.069 --> 00:16:42.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:44.720 align:start position:0%
if you get tired of waiting in line any
 
00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:45.590 align:start position:0%
if you get tired of waiting in line any
place

00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
place
 
00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:47.680 align:start position:0%
you can probably drive to twin mountain
 
00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:48.720 align:start position:0%
and back
 
00:16:51.829 --> 00:16:51.839 align:start position:0%
in the time it will take you to
 
00:16:54.629 --> 00:16:54.639 align:start position:0%
to get whatever you need done yeah at
 
00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
one of the other dmvs
 
00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:00.160 align:start position:0%

00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
no go run some copies okay because
 
00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:11.269 --> 00:26:11.279 align:start position:0%
this one is by
 
00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:38.789 --> 00:26:38.799 align:start position:0%
i'm representative jack
 
00:26:38.799 --> 00:26:47.990 align:start position:0%
i'm representative jack
1708

00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:50.149 --> 00:26:50.159 align:start position:0%
oh okay
 
00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:52.640 align:start position:0%
yeah that's good
 
00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:56.240 --> 00:27:11.510 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:13.909 --> 00:27:13.919 align:start position:0%
so mickey am i am i correct that we
 
00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:16.960 align:start position:0%
currently have two amendments
 
00:27:19.269 --> 00:27:19.279 align:start position:0%
on the table or
 
00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:21.440 align:start position:0%
that we've talked about for
 
00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:26.240 align:start position:0%
401 excluding these two new ones
 
00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
yes we have the one that representative
 
00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
jack provided and then we have the one
 
00:27:31.669 --> 00:27:31.679 align:start position:0%
we had the non-germane public hearing
 
00:27:32.789 --> 00:27:32.799 align:start position:0%
this morning
 
00:27:34.549 --> 00:27:34.559 align:start position:0%
plus these two so in total now there's
 
00:27:39.669 --> 00:27:39.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:39.679 --> 00:27:48.310 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:27:48.310 --> 00:27:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
no i want the one with the holes oh
 
00:27:56.630 --> 00:27:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:15.510 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
okay does everybody have everything they
 
00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.470 align:start position:0%
okay does everybody have everything they
need

00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:23.430 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:36.230 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
let's do 17
 
00:28:40.789 --> 00:28:40.799 align:start position:0%
these are actually going to be done in
 
00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
tandem okay
 
00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
because what it what it is is it's
 
00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:49.120 align:start position:0%
two different ways of allocating the
 
00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:50.070 align:start position:0%
two different ways of allocating the
money

00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:50.080 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:28:55.269 --> 00:28:55.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:57.029 --> 00:28:57.039 align:start position:0%
and the allocation
 
00:28:58.710 --> 00:28:58.720 align:start position:0%
difference is
 
00:29:01.909 --> 00:29:01.919 align:start position:0%
in the bridge program
 
00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:04.240 align:start position:0%
so if i could have my friends from
 
00:29:07.029 --> 00:29:07.039 align:start position:0%
transportation come in
 
00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
and join us
 
00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:10.830 align:start position:0%
and join us
and

00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:10.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:23.190 --> 00:29:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:25.750 align:start position:0%
 
a

00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:31.029 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:29:31.029 --> 00:29:31.039 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:29:32.789 --> 00:29:32.799 align:start position:0%
thing so you don't have to
 
00:29:35.110 --> 00:29:35.120 align:start position:0%
flip through all the pages to
 
00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:37.360 align:start position:0%
figure out where you are
 
00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:38.830 align:start position:0%
figure out where you are
so

00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:38.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:29:42.149 --> 00:29:42.159 align:start position:0%
um if you could
 
00:29:42.159 --> 00:29:43.990 align:start position:0%
um if you could
uh

00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:46.000 align:start position:0%
kind of explain
 
00:29:47.669 --> 00:29:47.679 align:start position:0%
the difference or what the two
 
00:29:47.679 --> 00:29:49.430 align:start position:0%
the difference or what the two
amendments

00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:50.710 align:start position:0%
amendments
are

00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:50.720 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
looking to do or however you want to go
 
00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:54.640 align:start position:0%
about it
 
00:29:57.510 --> 00:29:57.520 align:start position:0%
yeah so um
 
00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:58.470 align:start position:0%
yeah so um
we

00:29:58.470 --> 00:29:58.480 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
were here at a work session last week
 
00:30:02.149 --> 00:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
and we talked about the state aid bridge
 
00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:05.120 align:start position:0%
program originally in the original
 
00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:07.110 align:start position:0%
program originally in the original
amendment

00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
it was proposed that the 36 million go
 
00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:11.360 align:start position:0%
through the state aid bridge program
 
00:30:13.190 --> 00:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
and we had testified that going through
 
00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
that program could take three to five
 
00:30:17.269 --> 00:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
years for the money to be spent and the
 
00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
committee had indicated
 
00:30:21.029 --> 00:30:21.039 align:start position:0%
they wanted peace spent quicker get to
 
00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:23.360 align:start position:0%
the municipalities quicker so
 
00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
we went back and we looked at a couple
 
00:30:27.029 --> 00:30:27.039 align:start position:0%
of different scenarios on how to
 
00:30:30.549 --> 00:30:30.559 align:start position:0%
distribute the money um that um two back
 
00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:32.320 align:start position:0%
to the municipalities
 
00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
and so the first amendment looks at it
 
00:30:36.389 --> 00:30:36.399 align:start position:0%
on a perspective
 
00:30:39.029 --> 00:30:39.039 align:start position:0%
please do not look at the numbers yet
 
00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
until we understand what they mean
 
00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
because you're liable to gulp yes as
 
00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:48.480 align:start position:0%
you're doing that okay so please
 
00:30:50.389 --> 00:30:50.399 align:start position:0%
we'll go we'll get we'll get to the
 
00:30:50.399 --> 00:30:51.830 align:start position:0%
we'll go we'll get we'll get to the
numbers

00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
00:30:56.549 --> 00:30:56.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:59.750 --> 00:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
so the first amendment 1749
 
00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:02.480 align:start position:0%
um distributes the funds on a per capita
 
00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:05.360 align:start position:0%
basis so it takes the the square footage
 
00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
of the deck area that each town has
 
00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
and then based on their population
 
00:31:15.029 --> 00:31:15.039 align:start position:0%
calculates on a per capita basis
 
00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:17.200 align:start position:0%
and then distributes that 36 million
 
00:31:19.830 --> 00:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
based on the area per capita
 
00:31:22.549 --> 00:31:22.559 align:start position:0%
to each of the municipalities so in this
 
00:31:22.559 --> 00:31:24.470 align:start position:0%
to each of the municipalities so in this
situation

00:31:24.470 --> 00:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:31:27.269 --> 00:31:27.279 align:start position:0%
the lower the population generally
 
00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
you're going to get more money
 
00:31:31.029 --> 00:31:31.039 align:start position:0%
for your for the bridges
 
00:31:32.789 --> 00:31:32.799 align:start position:0%
the second amendment
 
00:31:36.389 --> 00:31:36.399 align:start position:0%
um takes the 36 million and distributed
 
00:31:36.399 --> 00:31:37.190 align:start position:0%
um takes the 36 million and distributed
um

00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:39.269 --> 00:31:39.279 align:start position:0%
similarly to the bloc grant aid formula
 
00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:41.120 align:start position:0%
currently the block grant aid formula
 
00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
currently that the 30 million dollars in
 
00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:45.200 align:start position:0%
the bill and also in that bill
 
00:31:47.509 --> 00:31:47.519 align:start position:0%
in section two
 
00:31:49.509 --> 00:31:49.519 align:start position:0%
that is done fifty percent based on
 
00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
population and fifty percent on the
 
00:31:54.789 --> 00:31:54.799 align:start position:0%
roadway in each city and town this this
 
00:31:56.470 --> 00:31:56.480 align:start position:0%
proposal in the second amendment would
 
00:31:59.110 --> 00:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
take it fifty percent on population and
 
00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:00.310 align:start position:0%
take it fifty percent on population and
50

00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:00.320 align:start position:0%
50
 
00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
50 on the municipal deck area square
 
00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:06.320 align:start position:0%
footage so it looks at um both of those
 
00:32:08.389 --> 00:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
at a 50 percent and then distributes
 
00:32:10.389 --> 00:32:10.399 align:start position:0%
distributes it more similarly to how
 
00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
block grant aid
 
00:32:13.669 --> 00:32:13.679 align:start position:0%
is distributed
 
00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:16.480 align:start position:0%
so you can see that there can in the per
 
00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
capita basis there can be some
 
00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:20.320 align:start position:0%
inequities there
 
00:32:22.389 --> 00:32:22.399 align:start position:0%
you know some of the larger towns um
 
00:32:24.549 --> 00:32:24.559 align:start position:0%
with high populations maybe getting
 
00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
small money the other the other way um
 
00:32:30.389 --> 00:32:30.399 align:start position:0%
you know those larger towns and cities
 
00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:31.440 align:start position:0%
are getting
 
00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:33.360 align:start position:0%
you know a more proportional share to
 
00:32:35.509 --> 00:32:35.519 align:start position:0%
the you know equivalent of the size of
 
00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
their bridges and the number of bridges
 
00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:38.720 align:start position:0%
and that type of thing
 
00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:39.750 align:start position:0%
and that type of thing
but

00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
the department is more thinks it's more
 
00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
equitable with option two um
 
00:32:46.710 --> 00:32:46.720 align:start position:0%
and our approach
 
00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:48.720 align:start position:0%
is it's similar to the block grant aid
 
00:32:51.029 --> 00:32:51.039 align:start position:0%
distribution it's much easier to explain
 
00:32:52.549 --> 00:32:52.559 align:start position:0%
that way that's how currently block
 
00:32:54.070 --> 00:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
grant aid goes out to the cities and
 
00:32:57.509 --> 00:32:57.519 align:start position:0%
towns and utilizing that methodology um
 
00:32:59.350 --> 00:32:59.360 align:start position:0%
appears to be the more equitable
 
00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:00.710 align:start position:0%
appears to be the more equitable
distribution

00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
distribution
 
00:33:02.710 --> 00:33:02.720 align:start position:0%
from our perspective but of course
 
00:33:04.549 --> 00:33:04.559 align:start position:0%
that's up to the committee and what how
 
00:33:06.389 --> 00:33:06.399 align:start position:0%
you would want to distribute it to the
 
00:33:08.149 --> 00:33:08.159 align:start position:0%
cities and towns
 
00:33:10.710 --> 00:33:10.720 align:start position:0%
maybe you could explain your numbers
 
00:33:13.669 --> 00:33:13.679 align:start position:0%
here so that uh
 
00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:15.440 align:start position:0%
so in the in the spreadsheet it's
 
00:33:18.149 --> 00:33:18.159 align:start position:0%
alphabetical by the cities and towns um
 
00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:20.240 align:start position:0%
we have bridge count
 
00:33:22.389 --> 00:33:22.399 align:start position:0%
just as a reference but we've taken the
 
00:33:24.389 --> 00:33:24.399 align:start position:0%
municipal deck area square footage of
 
00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:26.320 align:start position:0%
those bridges
 
00:33:28.549 --> 00:33:28.559 align:start position:0%
the population
 
00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:31.120 align:start position:0%
is determined by the
 
00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
office of planning and development so we
 
00:33:35.509 --> 00:33:35.519 align:start position:0%
get that january 1st of each year
 
00:33:38.230 --> 00:33:38.240 align:start position:0%
so we're using those population numbers
 
00:33:40.950 --> 00:33:40.960 align:start position:0%
and then calculate that area per capita
 
00:33:42.789 --> 00:33:42.799 align:start position:0%
and that distribution and then option
 
00:33:42.799 --> 00:33:44.149 align:start position:0%
and that distribution and then option
two

00:33:44.149 --> 00:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:33:46.389 --> 00:33:46.399 align:start position:0%
takes the population as a percentage of
 
00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
the total
 
00:33:50.870 --> 00:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
and the deck area as a pop as a
 
00:33:53.029 --> 00:33:53.039 align:start position:0%
percentage of the total and then we take
 
00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
50 percent
 
00:33:56.070 --> 00:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
of each of those to get a total
 
00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:57.430 align:start position:0%
of each of those to get a total
distribution

00:33:57.430 --> 00:33:57.440 align:start position:0%
distribution
 
00:33:59.029 --> 00:33:59.039 align:start position:0%
and add those two together to get that
 
00:34:01.509 --> 00:34:01.519 align:start position:0%
total distribution in the final column
 
00:34:06.789 --> 00:34:06.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:09.829 --> 00:34:09.839 align:start position:0%
okay are there any questions
 
00:34:12.470 --> 00:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
go ahead representative murray
 
00:34:14.950 --> 00:34:14.960 align:start position:0%
uh thanks thank you madam chair um how
 
00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
do i know who owns what bridge because
 
00:34:18.829 --> 00:34:18.839 align:start position:0%
you know i
 
00:34:22.069 --> 00:34:22.079 align:start position:0%
it's helps me understand new castle has
 
00:34:23.990 --> 00:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
two bridges but new castle is not here
 
00:34:27.270 --> 00:34:27.280 align:start position:0%
at all so who owns the newcastle these
 
00:34:29.669 --> 00:34:29.679 align:start position:0%
are municipal municipal bridges only so
 
00:34:32.149 --> 00:34:32.159 align:start position:0%
i i apologize for not explaining that so
 
00:34:33.750 --> 00:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
any state-owned bridges would not be
 
00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
included here these are only municipally
 
00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:37.200 align:start position:0%
owned bridges since the money is going
 
00:34:38.869 --> 00:34:38.879 align:start position:0%
out and it was intended to go through
 
00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
that state age bridge program which are
 
00:34:42.950 --> 00:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
municipally owned thank you for clearing
 
00:34:44.869 --> 00:34:44.879 align:start position:0%
you're welcome also turnpikes and
 
00:34:46.710 --> 00:34:46.720 align:start position:0%
railroad bridges would not be listed
 
00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:49.909 align:start position:0%
railroad bridges would not be listed
here

00:34:49.909 --> 00:34:49.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:51.750 --> 00:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
representative bucco thank you madam
 
00:34:55.030 --> 00:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
chair i just um a question on
 
00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:55.990 align:start position:0%
chair i just um a question on
the

00:34:55.990 --> 00:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:34:58.550 --> 00:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
the second formula is is amendment
 
00:34:58.560 --> 00:34:59.510 align:start position:0%
the second formula is is amendment
number

00:34:59.510 --> 00:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
number
 
00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:01.270 align:start position:0%
number
1756

00:35:01.270 --> 00:35:01.280 align:start position:0%
1756
 
00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
is that correct yep that's correct
 
00:35:07.109 --> 00:35:07.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:13.349 --> 00:35:13.359 align:start position:0%
did you have a question
 
00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:15.680 align:start position:0%
person heath yes thank you madam chair
 
00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:18.560 align:start position:0%
um so you recommend you no i don't know
 
00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
if you recommend but you're you're um
 
00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:23.200 align:start position:0%
saying that option two might be the most
 
00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:25.040 align:start position:0%
efficient and
 
00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
expeditious way to get these funds out
 
00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:30.640 align:start position:0%
did i hear that correctly or am i just
 
00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
jumping to that conclusion um
 
00:35:36.069 --> 00:35:36.079 align:start position:0%
i i think potentially the most equitable
 
00:35:38.790 --> 00:35:38.800 align:start position:0%
understandable the the size of the
 
00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:40.240 align:start position:0%
bridges and the number of bridges in
 
00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
those towns i think that this that
 
00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:43.670 align:start position:0%
those towns i think that this that
option

00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
option
 
00:35:45.430 --> 00:35:45.440 align:start position:0%
may be the most equitable so that would
 
00:35:48.790 --> 00:35:48.800 align:start position:0%
mean accepting amendment one seven five
 
00:35:50.069 --> 00:35:50.079 align:start position:0%
six h
 
00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:56.550 --> 00:35:56.560 align:start position:0%
and like i said it's similar to it's
 
00:35:58.550 --> 00:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
it's pretty much the same formula as
 
00:36:00.310 --> 00:36:00.320 align:start position:0%
what we're already doing block grant as
 
00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
so it's something that's been tried and
 
00:36:04.150 --> 00:36:04.160 align:start position:0%
true and we've been utilizing for many
 
00:36:10.069 --> 00:36:10.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:11.589 --> 00:36:11.599 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um
 
00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:16.240 align:start position:0%
do you take any account of the age of
 
00:36:19.109 --> 00:36:19.119 align:start position:0%
the bridges in the in the towns because
 
00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
if you've got new bridges let's say you
 
00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
just did them i mean it's
 
00:36:25.589 --> 00:36:25.599 align:start position:0%
it would doesn't make sense to uh we
 
00:36:28.390 --> 00:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
have not taken any of that into account
 
00:36:31.750 --> 00:36:31.760 align:start position:0%
um because of you know knowing that we
 
00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to get the money out
 
00:36:35.589 --> 00:36:35.599 align:start position:0%
expeditiously to to put in additional
 
00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:38.560 align:start position:0%
formulas and considerations we felt
 
00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:40.240 align:start position:0%
would hold up and not you know not be
 
00:36:41.910 --> 00:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
able to get the money out as
 
00:36:43.510 --> 00:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
expeditiously it would be a little more
 
00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:44.710 align:start position:0%
expeditiously it would be a little more
complicated

00:36:44.710 --> 00:36:44.720 align:start position:0%
complicated
 
00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:46.480 align:start position:0%
um so we have not taken that into
 
00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:48.710 align:start position:0%
um so we have not taken that into
account

00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
account
 
00:36:51.589 --> 00:36:51.599 align:start position:0%
if you remember they testified whenever
 
00:36:55.829 --> 00:36:55.839 align:start position:0%
monday whatever friday but uh
 
00:36:58.630 --> 00:36:58.640 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of extra money coming
 
00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:00.960 align:start position:0%
into the um
 
00:37:02.069 --> 00:37:02.079 align:start position:0%
state aid
 
00:37:04.390 --> 00:37:04.400 align:start position:0%
bridge program
 
00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
that's where you have a 20 match by the
 
00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:08.870 align:start position:0%
that's where you have a 20 match by the
towns

00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
towns
 
00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:09.670 align:start position:0%
towns
okay

00:37:09.670 --> 00:37:09.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:11.349 align:start position:0%
okay
so

00:37:11.349 --> 00:37:11.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:37:13.510 --> 00:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
the towns can either
 
00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:15.760 align:start position:0%
fix or red listed bridges under this
 
00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
program if they choose
 
00:37:20.150 --> 00:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
or they can fix them under
 
00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
the other program
 
00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:23.270 align:start position:0%
the other program
so

00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
you know it's uh
 
00:37:26.790 --> 00:37:26.800 align:start position:0%
it'll be
 
00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
up to each community to decide
 
00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:34.160 align:start position:0%
what bridges they need to repair
 
00:37:36.310 --> 00:37:36.320 align:start position:0%
and i don't think i have driven across
 
00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:37.510 align:start position:0%
and i don't think i have driven across
any

00:37:37.510 --> 00:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:37:39.589 --> 00:37:39.599 align:start position:0%
town-owned bridges any place in the
 
00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
state that couldn't use some work
 
00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:46.790 align:start position:0%
state that couldn't use some work
maybe

00:37:46.790 --> 00:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:49.750 --> 00:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
maybe otherwise
 
00:37:55.430 --> 00:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:00.390 --> 00:38:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:02.230 --> 00:38:02.240 align:start position:0%
option one
 
00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:17.349 align:start position:0%
 
1749

00:38:17.349 --> 00:38:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
can you walk me through the narrative
 
00:38:23.670 --> 00:38:23.680 align:start position:0%
looking at the numbers
 
00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:25.589 align:start position:0%
looking at the numbers
um

00:38:25.589 --> 00:38:25.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
i guess this is apropos smaller
 
00:38:29.190 --> 00:38:29.200 align:start position:0%
community which may not have the same
 
00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:31.200 align:start position:0%
tax base as a larger community
 
00:38:32.870 --> 00:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
potentially so when i'm looking at
 
00:38:34.870 --> 00:38:34.880 align:start position:0%
orford which is fairly small it appears
 
00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:36.560 align:start position:0%
in option one there's three hundred and
 
00:38:38.790 --> 00:38:38.800 align:start position:0%
forty thousand and an option two they go
 
00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
down to seventy three thousand in
 
00:38:43.510 --> 00:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
portsmouth which is considerably larger
 
00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
um in option one it's 148
 
00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:47.349 align:start position:0%
um in option one it's 148
and

00:38:47.349 --> 00:38:47.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:50.240 align:start position:0%
an option two is 741 000 difference of
 
00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:52.240 align:start position:0%
600 i guess and i'm using thousand i
 
00:38:53.829 --> 00:38:53.839 align:start position:0%
realize i'm
 
00:38:53.839 --> 00:38:54.710 align:start position:0%
realize i'm
um

00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:54.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:57.190 --> 00:38:57.200 align:start position:0%
can you just talk me through both
 
00:39:00.069 --> 00:39:00.079 align:start position:0%
stories about how how can i judge given
 
00:39:01.829 --> 00:39:01.839 align:start position:0%
the big difference between these numbers
 
00:39:03.750 --> 00:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
and the size of the communities which is
 
00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:06.320 align:start position:0%
more equitable
 
00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:08.630 align:start position:0%
more equitable
um

00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
it's it that's why i mean it's a policy
 
00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
decision that um you know you can make
 
00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:16.960 align:start position:0%
when you're looking at the number of
 
00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:18.880 align:start position:0%
bridges in that deck area
 
00:39:22.710 --> 00:39:22.720 align:start position:0%
orford has 13 bridges 8 000
 
00:39:25.750 --> 00:39:25.760 align:start position:0%
who are you comparing it to
 
00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:27.750 align:start position:0%
who are you comparing it to
portsmouth

00:39:27.750 --> 00:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
portsmouth
 
00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
which has 15 bridges but 63 000
 
00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
square feet of deck area so
 
00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
you're talking about you know
 
00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:38.720 align:start position:0%
four times as much deck area
 
00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:42.550 align:start position:0%
four times as much deck area
um

00:39:42.550 --> 00:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:44.069 --> 00:39:44.079 align:start position:0%
and they're then they'd and they'd be
 
00:39:47.109 --> 00:39:47.119 align:start position:0%
getting half of that amount of money so
 
00:39:49.349 --> 00:39:49.359 align:start position:0%
i mean the bridges are going to cost the
 
00:39:51.430 --> 00:39:51.440 align:start position:0%
same in each in each just in each
 
00:39:53.190 --> 00:39:53.200 align:start position:0%
community so i guess it's a policy
 
00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
decision whether you want more money to
 
00:39:57.030 --> 00:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
go to the smaller communities or you
 
00:39:58.790 --> 00:39:58.800 align:start position:0%
want it to be more equitable based on
 
00:40:01.030 --> 00:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
the population and the deck area than
 
00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
not you know the the size of these
 
00:40:05.829 --> 00:40:05.839 align:start position:0%
bridges that these communities have to
 
00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
repair and
 
00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:11.510 align:start position:0%
repair and
maintain

00:40:11.510 --> 00:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:14.069 --> 00:40:14.079 align:start position:0%
i think when the department first um
 
00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
came up with cats
 
00:40:18.309 --> 00:40:18.319 align:start position:0%
sorry that's okay when the department
 
00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
came up with the the first amendment um
 
00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:22.720 align:start position:0%
we were looking to give relief to the
 
00:40:24.870 --> 00:40:24.880 align:start position:0%
smaller towns but then when we looked at
 
00:40:26.950 --> 00:40:26.960 align:start position:0%
the actual what the distribution would
 
00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
be it seemed like it went too far over
 
00:40:32.309 --> 00:40:32.319 align:start position:0%
in um
 
00:40:34.150 --> 00:40:34.160 align:start position:0%
in favor of the smaller towns because
 
00:40:36.230 --> 00:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
they didn't have the deck area but they
 
00:40:39.109 --> 00:40:39.119 align:start position:0%
were raised by the low population
 
00:40:39.119 --> 00:40:40.069 align:start position:0%
were raised by the low population
so

00:40:40.069 --> 00:40:40.079 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:40:42.550 --> 00:40:42.560 align:start position:0%
larger cities and towns weren't getting
 
00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
money to meet the needs that the
 
00:40:46.390 --> 00:40:46.400 align:start position:0%
amount of
 
00:40:48.069 --> 00:40:48.079 align:start position:0%
bridge deck had
 
00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
versus the smaller towns which didn't
 
00:40:51.589 --> 00:40:51.599 align:start position:0%
have much and were getting a lot more
 
00:40:54.550 --> 00:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
money so it just didn't seem equitable
 
00:40:56.309 --> 00:40:56.319 align:start position:0%
from that perspective which is why we
 
00:41:03.190 --> 00:41:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:04.150 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:41:04.150 --> 00:41:04.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:05.510 align:start position:0%
okay
so

00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:41:10.230 --> 00:41:10.240 align:start position:0%
can i assume that we will just not
 
00:41:16.069 --> 00:41:16.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:16.079 --> 00:41:19.030 align:start position:0%
 
1749

00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
1749
 
00:41:21.990 --> 00:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
everybody is in favor of the other
 
00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:26.630 align:start position:0%
everybody is in favor of the other
methodology

00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:27.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:41:27.990 --> 00:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:41:29.030 --> 00:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
yeah i yeah i think so i was just going
 
00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
to ask
 
00:41:35.109 --> 00:41:35.119 align:start position:0%
i'm assuming this is a a nice easy
 
00:41:37.510 --> 00:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet would it be
 
00:41:39.030 --> 00:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
not we'll continue on what we're doing
 
00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
today would it be possible get
 
00:41:45.430 --> 00:41:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:49.670 --> 00:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
and which 75 75 by dex 25 by population
 
00:41:56.950 --> 00:41:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:58.790 --> 00:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
thank you we'll get that to you later
 
00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:02.790 align:start position:0%
thank you we'll get that to you later
today

00:42:02.790 --> 00:42:02.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:04.470 align:start position:0%
 
okay

paragraph one
 
00:43:04.950 --> 00:43:04.960 align:start position:0%
we just changed
 
00:43:09.990 --> 00:43:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:15.589 --> 00:43:15.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
this is the
 
00:43:22.390 --> 00:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
normal distribution for roads
 
00:43:27.670 --> 00:43:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:29.990 --> 00:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
so that one
 
00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.270 align:start position:0%
so that one
stays

00:43:33.270 --> 00:43:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:35.270 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:43:35.270 --> 00:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:43:40.950 --> 00:43:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:44.309 --> 00:43:44.319 align:start position:0%
is the money for body-worn dashboard
 
00:43:44.319 --> 00:43:58.710 align:start position:0%
is the money for body-worn dashboard
cameras

00:43:58.710 --> 00:43:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:02.790 --> 00:44:02.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:04.150 align:start position:0%
 
hurry

hurry
 
00:44:08.230 --> 00:44:08.240 align:start position:0%
where's the part that d.o.t wanted the
 
00:44:16.150 --> 00:44:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:20.470 --> 00:44:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:23.910 --> 00:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
prohibited exception for dash cameras
 
00:44:31.430 --> 00:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:43.030 align:start position:0%
 
please

00:44:43.030 --> 00:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:44.550 --> 00:44:44.560 align:start position:0%
because i i don't want i don't want to
 
00:44:59.430 --> 00:44:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:07.670 --> 00:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:12.309 --> 00:45:12.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:12.319 --> 00:45:13.670 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:45:15.030 --> 00:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
you've been in the mic we don't have any
 
00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:17.200 align:start position:0%
amendments on section four at this time
 
00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:18.550 align:start position:0%
amendments on section four at this time
okay

00:45:18.550 --> 00:45:18.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:45:19.829 --> 00:45:19.839 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:45:19.839 --> 00:45:21.270 align:start position:0%
all right
so

00:45:21.270 --> 00:45:21.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:45:29.190 --> 00:45:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:30.550 align:start position:0%
 
is

00:45:30.550 --> 00:45:30.560 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:45:32.870 --> 00:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
paragraph two of
 
00:45:35.510 --> 00:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
the jack amendment
 
00:45:37.750 --> 00:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
does that replace paragraph two of the
 
00:45:41.670 --> 00:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:43.270 --> 00:45:43.280 align:start position:0%
yes okay so
 
00:45:44.829 --> 00:45:44.839 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:45:49.109 --> 00:45:49.119 align:start position:0%
out the original bill is out and
 
00:45:50.550 --> 00:45:50.560 align:start position:0%
this is in
 
00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:51.589 align:start position:0%
this is in
so

00:45:51.589 --> 00:45:51.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:45:54.309 --> 00:45:54.319 align:start position:0%
if the division were to support
 
00:45:56.470 --> 00:45:56.480 align:start position:0%
sections two and three uh the
 
00:45:58.710 --> 00:45:58.720 align:start position:0%
appropriation with uh representative
 
00:46:01.030 --> 00:46:01.040 align:start position:0%
jack's amendment you could just modify a
 
00:46:02.790 --> 00:46:02.800 align:start position:0%
vote or if you want another piece of
 
00:46:04.069 --> 00:46:04.079 align:start position:0%
paper i actually have an amendment
 
00:46:04.079 --> 00:46:05.190 align:start position:0%
paper i actually have an amendment
drafted

00:46:05.190 --> 00:46:05.200 align:start position:0%
drafted
 
00:46:06.790 --> 00:46:06.800 align:start position:0%
with just
 
00:46:08.470 --> 00:46:08.480 align:start position:0%
us i assumed you were gonna do something
 
00:46:10.069 --> 00:46:10.079 align:start position:0%
different with section one which we did
 
00:46:11.589 --> 00:46:11.599 align:start position:0%
right so i do have another amendment
 
00:46:13.190 --> 00:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
that just have representative jack
 
00:46:14.950 --> 00:46:14.960 align:start position:0%
sections for two and three if you want
 
00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:16.230 align:start position:0%
sections for two and three if you want
that

00:46:16.230 --> 00:46:16.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:46:18.150 --> 00:46:18.160 align:start position:0%
okay but then where do we have we don't
 
00:46:19.829 --> 00:46:19.839 align:start position:0%
have four four we don't have an
 
00:46:21.829 --> 00:46:21.839 align:start position:0%
amendment to because we're not
 
00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
amending it so i'm gonna i'm gonna
 
00:46:25.829 --> 00:46:25.839 align:start position:0%
eventually string these amendments so
 
00:46:27.190 --> 00:46:27.200 align:start position:0%
we're gonna at least have two amendments
 
00:46:28.470 --> 00:46:28.480 align:start position:0%
in all likelihood and then we're going
 
00:46:30.069 --> 00:46:30.079 align:start position:0%
to discuss the amendment that we heard
 
00:46:32.230 --> 00:46:32.240 align:start position:0%
this morning so with multiple amendments
 
00:46:34.150 --> 00:46:34.160 align:start position:0%
being recommended i was going to string
 
00:46:36.550 --> 00:46:36.560 align:start position:0%
it for one committee amendment section 4
 
00:46:38.870 --> 00:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
is not addressed at any point in any of
 
00:46:40.470 --> 00:46:40.480 align:start position:0%
these so that's why you're not seeing it
 
00:46:43.030 --> 00:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
on the amendments okay but it will be
 
00:46:44.069 --> 00:46:44.079 align:start position:0%
when we
 
00:46:45.589 --> 00:46:45.599 align:start position:0%
i mean it would be in the underlying
 
00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
bill as amended okay um
 
00:46:49.510 --> 00:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
if it's the committee's preference to
 
00:46:52.710 --> 00:46:52.720 align:start position:0%
see an amendment that replaces all with
 
00:46:54.150 --> 00:46:54.160 align:start position:0%
and then you see it again i can
 
00:46:56.550 --> 00:46:56.560 align:start position:0%
certainly draft it that way too i think
 
00:46:59.990 --> 00:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
it would be less confusing okay
 
00:47:01.349 --> 00:47:01.359 align:start position:0%
so when i do a
 
00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
final it's not just me yeah it's we've
 
00:47:06.790 --> 00:47:06.800 align:start position:0%
gotta we gotta get it through that other
 
00:47:09.829 --> 00:47:09.839 align:start position:0%
yep group of people so when um when
 
00:47:11.589 --> 00:47:11.599 align:start position:0%
we're completed our recommendations
 
00:47:12.790 --> 00:47:12.800 align:start position:0%
we'll have multiple amendments in all
 
00:47:15.030 --> 00:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
likelihood and division when i do string
 
00:47:17.030 --> 00:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
it i'll do a replace all with and it
 
00:47:19.430 --> 00:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
will still include section four okay
 
00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:20.390 align:start position:0%
will still include section four okay
okay

00:47:20.390 --> 00:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:22.240 align:start position:0%
is there anybody that's opposed to doing
 
00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:25.430 align:start position:0%
is there anybody that's opposed to doing
that

00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:28.950 --> 00:47:28.960 align:start position:0%
that's a a lot easier i think okay
 
00:47:35.990 --> 00:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:38.790 --> 00:47:38.800 align:start position:0%
madam chair so
 
00:47:41.430 --> 00:47:41.440 align:start position:0%
my understanding on 1708
 
00:47:44.150 --> 00:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
um we would be
 
00:47:45.990 --> 00:47:46.000 align:start position:0%
uh voting to either approve or
 
00:47:48.630 --> 00:47:48.640 align:start position:0%
disapprove of this amendment absent
 
00:47:50.790 --> 00:47:50.800 align:start position:0%
section one since we just
 
00:47:53.910 --> 00:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:55.990 --> 00:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
well mickey has something or i can just
 
00:47:58.470 --> 00:47:58.480 align:start position:0%
kind of we can forget 1708 if you want
 
00:48:00.630 --> 00:48:00.640 align:start position:0%
and have a replacement for gotcha yeah i
 
00:48:02.470 --> 00:48:02.480 align:start position:0%
can do that very good all right
 
00:48:08.150 --> 00:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:17.109 --> 00:48:17.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:24.069 --> 00:48:24.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:26.549 --> 00:48:26.559 align:start position:0%
this is kind of like when uh when we're
 
00:48:29.589 --> 00:48:29.599 align:start position:0%
finalizing the hb2 and
 
00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:32.720 align:start position:0%
the budget and you get 12 000 pieces of
 
00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:38.549 align:start position:0%
the budget and you get 12 000 pieces of
paper

00:48:38.549 --> 00:48:38.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:38.559 --> 00:48:40.150 align:start position:0%
 
no

00:48:40.150 --> 00:48:40.160 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:41.270 align:start position:0%
no
no

00:48:41.270 --> 00:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:48:44.069 --> 00:48:44.079 align:start position:0%
this is just
 
00:48:47.670 --> 00:48:47.680 align:start position:0%
this is taken out of the jack amendment
 
00:48:51.430 --> 00:48:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:54.150 --> 00:48:54.160 align:start position:0%
that's not in here
 
00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:56.549 align:start position:0%
that's not in here
okay

00:48:56.549 --> 00:48:56.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:58.710 --> 00:48:58.720 align:start position:0%
so what would happen is you've you've
 
00:49:01.750 --> 00:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
voted on on 1756
 
00:49:03.910 --> 00:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
if you accepted this now you've taken
 
00:49:05.589 --> 00:49:05.599 align:start position:0%
care of sections one two and three of
 
00:49:07.109 --> 00:49:07.119 align:start position:0%
the bill four is unchanged and then it
 
00:49:08.470 --> 00:49:08.480 align:start position:0%
would be up for a further amendment
 
00:49:10.549 --> 00:49:10.559 align:start position:0%
which then we would discuss the
 
00:49:16.710 --> 00:49:16.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:19.309 --> 00:49:19.319 align:start position:0%
can i see if i i have that certainly
 
00:49:23.829 --> 00:49:23.839 align:start position:0%
1756 replaces section one no okay yes
 
00:49:25.470 --> 00:49:25.480 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:49:28.950 --> 00:49:28.960 align:start position:0%
1797 is gonna replace two and three
 
00:49:32.230 --> 00:49:32.240 align:start position:0%
that's correct and it's four is going to
 
00:49:33.990 --> 00:49:34.000 align:start position:0%
come back the way it was four is going
 
00:49:36.790 --> 00:49:36.800 align:start position:0%
to come back in a new amendment
 
00:49:38.790 --> 00:49:38.800 align:start position:0%
that includes sections one two three and
 
00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:40.470 align:start position:0%

this road is currently a state road
 
00:52:14.790 --> 00:52:14.800 align:start position:0%
correct correct correct okay
 
00:52:17.750 --> 00:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
do we have any history as to how
 
00:52:20.309 --> 00:52:20.319 align:start position:0%
it became a state road
 
00:52:23.990 --> 00:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:26.950 --> 00:52:26.960 align:start position:0%
the balsams don't say nowhere
 
00:52:30.309 --> 00:52:30.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:34.230 --> 00:52:34.240 align:start position:0%
okay i'm i'm i'm sure it goes
 
00:52:37.190 --> 00:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
well back to the 1920s and 1930s before
 
00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:38.309 align:start position:0%
well back to the 1920s and 1930s before
route

00:52:38.309 --> 00:52:38.319 align:start position:0%
route
 
00:52:41.589 --> 00:52:41.599 align:start position:0%
26 was was built and
 
00:52:41.599 --> 00:52:42.470 align:start position:0%
26 was was built and
um

00:52:42.470 --> 00:52:42.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:44.150 --> 00:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
cold springs road
 
00:52:46.790 --> 00:52:46.800 align:start position:0%
that goes around the
 
00:52:50.710 --> 00:52:50.720 align:start position:0%
north side or the back side of
 
00:52:53.910 --> 00:52:53.920 align:start position:0%
uh lake um gloriette where the balsams
 
00:52:56.390 --> 00:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
is was was the state highway and down
 
00:52:58.829 --> 00:52:58.839 align:start position:0%
over the hill and down over the dam
 
00:53:02.470 --> 00:53:02.480 align:start position:0%
um and golf links road was was off that
 
00:53:04.710 --> 00:53:04.720 align:start position:0%
and an abandoned portion that loops back
 
00:53:07.910 --> 00:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
around to diamond pond road so i think
 
00:53:10.630 --> 00:53:10.640 align:start position:0%
back in the back in the 20s that was the
 
00:53:14.790 --> 00:53:14.800 align:start position:0%
roadway network up there before route 26
 
00:53:17.750 --> 00:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
and stuff was built
 
00:53:22.069 --> 00:53:22.079 align:start position:0%
when route 26 was built those roads just
 
00:53:24.069 --> 00:53:24.079 align:start position:0%
continued to be classified as state
 
00:53:24.079 --> 00:53:25.990 align:start position:0%
continued to be classified as state
highways

00:53:25.990 --> 00:53:26.000 align:start position:0%
highways
 
00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:27.280 align:start position:0%
they were never
 
00:53:30.470 --> 00:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
abandoned or discontinued or or
 
00:53:33.030 --> 00:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
or turned over
 
00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:35.349 align:start position:0%
or turned over
okay

00:53:35.349 --> 00:53:35.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:40.390 --> 00:53:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:42.950 --> 00:53:42.960 align:start position:0%
it's it's apparent you
 
00:53:45.589 --> 00:53:45.599 align:start position:0%
d.o.t does not want to use highway funds
 
00:53:47.030 --> 00:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
to repair this
 
00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:49.190 align:start position:0%
to repair this
road

00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:49.200 align:start position:0%
road
 
00:53:51.990 --> 00:53:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:53.510 --> 00:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
i would say that
 
00:53:55.670 --> 00:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
there would have to be choices the uh in
 
00:53:57.670 --> 00:53:57.680 align:start position:0%
the 10-year plan the funds are all
 
00:53:58.950 --> 00:53:58.960 align:start position:0%
committed so
 
00:53:58.960 --> 00:54:00.470 align:start position:0%
committed so
to

00:54:00.470 --> 00:54:00.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:54:02.309 --> 00:54:02.319 align:start position:0%
put those funds towards
 
00:54:02.319 --> 00:54:03.349 align:start position:0%
put those funds towards
something

00:54:03.349 --> 00:54:03.359 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:54:05.670 --> 00:54:05.680 align:start position:0%
some something else would have to um not
 
00:54:07.910 --> 00:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
be done in order to do this
 
00:54:11.430 --> 00:54:11.440 align:start position:0%
in order to do golf links road so
 
00:54:16.309 --> 00:54:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:20.950 --> 00:54:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:23.589 --> 00:54:23.599 align:start position:0%
this amendment says you have to have the
 
00:54:25.430 --> 00:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
funding and you have to have this and
 
00:54:27.670 --> 00:54:27.680 align:start position:0%
you have to have that
 
00:54:27.680 --> 00:54:28.710 align:start position:0%
you have to have that
before

00:54:28.710 --> 00:54:28.720 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:54:30.549 --> 00:54:30.559 align:start position:0%
you can proceed
 
00:54:33.750 --> 00:54:33.760 align:start position:0%
so the the the legislature can previous
 
00:54:35.670 --> 00:54:35.680 align:start position:0%
10-year plans had a condition in the
 
00:54:38.150 --> 00:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
10-year plan about um you know the
 
00:54:39.750 --> 00:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
funding toward the construction of golf
 
00:54:41.109 --> 00:54:41.119 align:start position:0%
links road
 
00:54:41.119 --> 00:54:42.470 align:start position:0%
links road
okay

00:54:42.470 --> 00:54:42.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:44.470 align:start position:0%
okay
okay

00:54:44.470 --> 00:54:44.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:45.349 align:start position:0%
okay
okay

00:54:45.349 --> 00:54:45.359 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:54:48.150 --> 00:54:48.160 align:start position:0%
are there any other specific questions
 
00:54:50.950 --> 00:54:50.960 align:start position:0%
that you have that
 
00:54:55.030 --> 00:54:55.040 align:start position:0%
were discussed this morning
 
00:55:00.230 --> 00:55:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:02.150 --> 00:55:02.160 align:start position:0%
representative lynn
 
00:55:05.589 --> 00:55:05.599 align:start position:0%
can i have to ask a question i i have um
 
00:55:09.109 --> 00:55:09.119 align:start position:0%
i have gotten at least some suggestion
 
00:55:11.190 --> 00:55:11.200 align:start position:0%
not at the hearing but from discussion
 
00:55:12.870 --> 00:55:12.880 align:start position:0%
with another representative afterwards
 
00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:14.150 align:start position:0%
with another representative afterwards
that

00:55:14.150 --> 00:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:55:19.190 --> 00:55:19.200 align:start position:0%
there is some question or some feeling
 
00:55:22.309 --> 00:55:22.319 align:start position:0%
perhaps in the north country that um
 
00:55:23.910 --> 00:55:23.920 align:start position:0%
uh although
 
00:55:25.589 --> 00:55:25.599 align:start position:0%
you know although this balsam's
 
00:55:27.190 --> 00:55:27.200 align:start position:0%
development is very well intended and
 
00:55:29.190 --> 00:55:29.200 align:start position:0%
people want people want it to happen
 
00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:30.069 align:start position:0%
people want people want it to happen
that

00:55:30.069 --> 00:55:30.079 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:55:30.079 --> 00:55:31.190 align:start position:0%
that
um

00:55:31.190 --> 00:55:31.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:33.750 --> 00:55:33.760 align:start position:0%
not much progress at all of it actually
 
00:55:33.760 --> 00:55:34.870 align:start position:0%
not much progress at all of it actually
happening

00:55:34.870 --> 00:55:34.880 align:start position:0%
happening
 
00:55:36.390 --> 00:55:36.400 align:start position:0%
is uh
 
00:55:37.589 --> 00:55:37.599 align:start position:0%
has occurred
 
00:55:40.069 --> 00:55:40.079 align:start position:0%
and so i i i guess
 
00:55:40.079 --> 00:55:41.109 align:start position:0%
and so i i i guess
um

00:55:41.109 --> 00:55:41.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:42.230 --> 00:55:42.240 align:start position:0%
you know that would normally be a
 
00:55:45.030 --> 00:55:45.040 align:start position:0%
concern to me but as i understand this
 
00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:46.309 align:start position:0%
concern to me but as i understand this
proposal

00:55:46.309 --> 00:55:46.319 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
00:55:46.319 --> 00:55:47.190 align:start position:0%
proposal
the

00:55:47.190 --> 00:55:47.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:55:49.109 --> 00:55:49.119 align:start position:0%
the department wouldn't sort of be on
 
00:55:51.190 --> 00:55:51.200 align:start position:0%
the hook so to speak for the money
 
00:55:53.190 --> 00:55:53.200 align:start position:0%
unless all those other things actually
 
00:55:56.789 --> 00:55:56.799 align:start position:0%
were did come together and so i mean is
 
00:55:58.950 --> 00:55:58.960 align:start position:0%
that and you you've indicated that that
 
00:56:00.870 --> 00:56:00.880 align:start position:0%
kind of thing has happened in the past
 
00:56:02.950 --> 00:56:02.960 align:start position:0%
and other
 
00:56:04.549 --> 00:56:04.559 align:start position:0%
so i mean does that provide sort of
 
00:56:06.549 --> 00:56:06.559 align:start position:0%
sufficient protection
 
00:56:07.990 --> 00:56:08.000 align:start position:0%
to the department that you're not going
 
00:56:08.870 --> 00:56:08.880 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:56:11.030 --> 00:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
you're not going to be dumping out 4.1
 
00:56:12.950 --> 00:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
million dollars if it turns out that mr
 
00:56:15.750 --> 00:56:15.760 align:start position:0%
otton doesn't actually
 
00:56:18.470 --> 00:56:18.480 align:start position:0%
get the development going
 
00:56:21.190 --> 00:56:21.200 align:start position:0%
and in previous tenure plans there there
 
00:56:24.230 --> 00:56:24.240 align:start position:0%
was that that that condition that uh the
 
00:56:26.789 --> 00:56:26.799 align:start position:0%
funding for that project and the the
 
00:56:28.309 --> 00:56:28.319 align:start position:0%
couldn't be spent until i think the
 
00:56:30.710 --> 00:56:30.720 align:start position:0%
wording was commercial activities
 
00:56:32.549 --> 00:56:32.559 align:start position:0%
commenced or something like that i
 
00:56:34.470 --> 00:56:34.480 align:start position:0%
haven't seen that amendment i've heard
 
00:56:36.309 --> 00:56:36.319 align:start position:0%
it discussed and i i think it is a
 
00:56:37.430 --> 00:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
little more
 
00:56:39.829 --> 00:56:39.839 align:start position:0%
uh specific in the and
 
00:56:41.910 --> 00:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
and what needs to happen but i think
 
00:56:44.870 --> 00:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
there's a fundamental discussion on on
 
00:56:47.510 --> 00:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
whether it is the legislature's desire
 
00:56:47.520 --> 00:56:48.230 align:start position:0%
whether it is the legislature's desire
uh

00:56:48.230 --> 00:56:48.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:56:48.240 --> 00:56:50.069 align:start position:0%
uh
for

00:56:50.069 --> 00:56:50.079 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:56:52.309 --> 00:56:52.319 align:start position:0%
for the department to be to
 
00:56:55.510 --> 00:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
with such caveats and protections to be
 
00:56:57.430 --> 00:56:57.440 align:start position:0%
spending um
 
00:56:59.910 --> 00:56:59.920 align:start position:0%
highway funds for this for this purpose
 
00:57:01.990 --> 00:57:02.000 align:start position:0%
if that is the desire and we are
 
00:57:03.589 --> 00:57:03.599 align:start position:0%
directed through the 10-year plan or
 
00:57:05.750 --> 00:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
something we will do so i know there's
 
00:57:07.510 --> 00:57:07.520 align:start position:0%
also been discussion about should should
 
00:57:10.069 --> 00:57:10.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:12.150 --> 00:57:12.160 align:start position:0%
some other other funding source that
 
00:57:14.390 --> 00:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
would um right now the way the amendment
 
00:57:17.430 --> 00:57:17.440 align:start position:0%
is is general funds oh okay okay that
 
00:57:18.789 --> 00:57:18.799 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:57:19.910 --> 00:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
and i didn't know if that was your
 
00:57:21.510 --> 00:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
question i didn't realize the amendment
 
00:57:24.390 --> 00:57:24.400 align:start position:0%
was general funds yeah yeah so yes it
 
00:57:26.549 --> 00:57:26.559 align:start position:0%
does offer those i i believe it does
 
00:57:28.789 --> 00:57:28.799 align:start position:0%
offer those protections and
 
00:57:30.549 --> 00:57:30.559 align:start position:0%
that's the desire to find to fund this
 
00:57:32.870 --> 00:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
if the pro if the balsams project is
 
00:57:34.309 --> 00:57:34.319 align:start position:0%
going forward
 
00:57:38.829 --> 00:57:38.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:43.349 --> 00:57:43.359 align:start position:0%
okay heath thank you madam chair is it
 
00:57:46.549 --> 00:57:46.559 align:start position:0%
possible or feasible to use
 
00:57:48.549 --> 00:57:48.559 align:start position:0%
this some of this infrastructure money
 
00:57:50.150 --> 00:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
coming in
 
00:57:53.349 --> 00:57:53.359 align:start position:0%
um for this purpose or is that not an
 
00:57:56.470 --> 00:57:56.480 align:start position:0%
allowable expense
 
00:57:57.829 --> 00:57:57.839 align:start position:0%
one of the one of the concerns i
 
00:57:59.430 --> 00:57:59.440 align:start position:0%
apologize because the speakers in the
 
00:58:01.589 --> 00:58:01.599 align:start position:0%
way the um
 
00:58:04.390 --> 00:58:04.400 align:start position:0%
because of the classification of of road
 
00:58:07.030 --> 00:58:07.040 align:start position:0%
it's a non-federal aid eligible piece of
 
00:58:09.109 --> 00:58:09.119 align:start position:0%
highway so federal funds cannot be spent
 
00:58:16.630 --> 00:58:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:18.549 --> 00:58:18.559 align:start position:0%
okay are there any other questions for
 
00:58:18.559 --> 00:58:19.829 align:start position:0%
okay are there any other questions for
mr

00:58:19.829 --> 00:58:19.839 align:start position:0%
mr
 
00:58:19.839 --> 00:58:21.589 align:start position:0%
mr
representative

00:58:21.589 --> 00:58:21.599 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:58:23.030 --> 00:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:24.069 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
um

00:58:24.069 --> 00:58:24.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:25.670 --> 00:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
i'm just uh
 
00:58:28.150 --> 00:58:28.160 align:start position:0%
i know there's
 
00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:29.910 align:start position:0%
i know there's
there's

00:58:29.910 --> 00:58:29.920 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:58:31.910 --> 00:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
particular provisions of this amendment
 
00:58:33.589 --> 00:58:33.599 align:start position:0%
that could be
 
00:58:37.750 --> 00:58:37.760 align:start position:0%
um improved however this this project
 
00:58:41.510 --> 00:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
has potential to be an um
 
00:58:43.190 --> 00:58:43.200 align:start position:0%
an economic driver for the whole
 
00:58:45.349 --> 00:58:45.359 align:start position:0%
northern half of the state not just
 
00:58:47.910 --> 00:58:47.920 align:start position:0%
colebrook or the particular town but but
 
00:58:49.750 --> 00:58:49.760 align:start position:0%
for the whole area
 
00:58:51.109 --> 00:58:51.119 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:58:52.150 --> 00:58:52.160 align:start position:0%
if this
 
00:58:53.589 --> 00:58:53.599 align:start position:0%
if this
 
00:58:55.670 --> 00:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
putting this road in would be an
 
00:58:57.829 --> 00:58:57.839 align:start position:0%
incentive to get the financing package
 
00:58:59.109 --> 00:58:59.119 align:start position:0%
back together
 
00:59:02.230 --> 00:59:02.240 align:start position:0%
i tend to support it
 
00:59:04.390 --> 00:59:04.400 align:start position:0%
and that's i think what i'm going to do
 
00:59:09.430 --> 00:59:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:11.510 --> 00:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
are you all set with me no i have
 
00:59:11.520 --> 00:59:14.730 align:start position:0%
are you all set with me no i have
another

00:59:14.730 --> 00:59:14.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:14.740 --> 00:59:17.190 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

00:59:17.190 --> 00:59:17.200 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:59:20.309 --> 00:59:20.319 align:start position:0%
no this has nothing to do with this road
 
00:59:23.349 --> 00:59:23.359 align:start position:0%
uh can you tell me or have someone call
 
00:59:24.770 --> 00:59:24.780 align:start position:0%
me about when
 
00:59:24.780 --> 00:59:25.829 align:start position:0%
me about when
[Music]

00:59:25.829 --> 00:59:25.839 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:59:25.839 --> 00:59:27.270 align:start position:0%
[Music]
the

00:59:27.270 --> 00:59:27.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:59:30.069 --> 00:59:30.079 align:start position:0%
state property that was uh
 
00:59:32.549 --> 00:59:32.559 align:start position:0%
taken for the bypass
 
00:59:36.390 --> 00:59:36.400 align:start position:0%
is going to be available for sale
 
00:59:38.710 --> 00:59:38.720 align:start position:0%
because everybody i have
 
00:59:40.950 --> 00:59:40.960 align:start position:0%
i have discussed it with
 
00:59:42.390 --> 00:59:42.400 align:start position:0%
they say well
 
00:59:45.349 --> 00:59:45.359 align:start position:0%
nobody seems to know
 
00:59:48.630 --> 00:59:48.640 align:start position:0%
and i know that you know we owe 20 how
 
00:59:51.270 --> 00:59:51.280 align:start position:0%
much 90 million dollars
 
00:59:53.510 --> 00:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
some exorbitant amount of money back to
 
00:59:57.589 --> 00:59:57.599 align:start position:0%
the fed 20 28 28. yeah that's the right
 
01:00:00.470 --> 01:00:00.480 align:start position:0%
number 28 million
 
01:00:03.270 --> 01:00:03.280 align:start position:0%
that we owe back to the feds so you know
 
01:00:04.950 --> 01:00:04.960 align:start position:0%
maybe the three million we could get for
 
01:00:07.030 --> 01:00:07.040 align:start position:0%
the property would help
 
01:00:09.030 --> 01:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
i i can get you a list i know
 
01:00:10.789 --> 01:00:10.799 align:start position:0%
some of the sales are proceeding that
 
01:00:12.870 --> 01:00:12.880 align:start position:0%
they're taking kind of parcel by parcel
 
01:00:14.390 --> 01:00:14.400 align:start position:0%
depending on the most marketable and the
 
01:00:16.950 --> 01:00:16.960 align:start position:0%
most interest um so i know we've had
 
01:00:19.030 --> 01:00:19.040 align:start position:0%
some action around schema building
 
01:00:21.589 --> 01:00:21.599 align:start position:0%
there's been some other isolated puzzles
 
01:00:23.030 --> 01:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
01:00:25.670 --> 01:00:25.680 align:start position:0%
um we've been working with um
 
01:00:27.270 --> 01:00:27.280 align:start position:0%
uh it's been expressed interest from
 
01:00:29.829 --> 01:00:29.839 align:start position:0%
coleman and others so we
 
01:00:32.950 --> 01:00:32.960 align:start position:0%
we try to um
 
01:00:35.430 --> 01:00:35.440 align:start position:0%
focus on the more marketable pieces of
 
01:00:38.230 --> 01:00:38.240 align:start position:0%
of the bypass so um i can get you a
 
01:00:40.789 --> 01:00:40.799 align:start position:0%
summary or something but
 
01:00:42.470 --> 01:00:42.480 align:start position:0%
some are in the works some have already
 
01:00:44.789 --> 01:00:44.799 align:start position:0%
gone forward so it is it is it is going
 
01:00:47.349 --> 01:00:47.359 align:start position:0%
forward uh um trying to set market and
 
01:00:49.430 --> 01:00:49.440 align:start position:0%
sell um
 
01:00:52.150 --> 01:00:52.160 align:start position:0%
the remnant pieces of the conway bypass
 
01:00:54.549 --> 01:00:54.559 align:start position:0%
okay yeah thank you you're welcome yeah
 
01:00:58.390 --> 01:00:58.400 align:start position:0%
by the way when we do the budget
 
01:01:00.150 --> 01:01:00.160 align:start position:0%
we'll have to put money in there we did
 
01:01:02.710 --> 01:01:02.720 align:start position:0%
we didn't pay all that off did we
 
01:01:06.150 --> 01:01:06.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:08.710 --> 01:01:08.720 align:start position:0%
yo we're all well we paid it all off
 
01:01:10.870 --> 01:01:10.880 align:start position:0%
last time well we it's not all paid off
 
01:01:12.390 --> 01:01:12.400 align:start position:0%
we have a
 
01:01:15.109 --> 01:01:15.119 align:start position:0%
sorry we have a plan a graduated plan
 
01:01:17.109 --> 01:01:17.119 align:start position:0%
over three years to pay back federal
 
01:01:19.109 --> 01:01:19.119 align:start position:0%
highway so it's not coming all at once
 
01:01:19.119 --> 01:01:20.870 align:start position:0%
highway so it's not coming all at once
yeah

01:01:20.870 --> 01:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:01:23.829 --> 01:01:23.839 align:start position:0%
okay sorry for that that's okay kind of
 
01:01:26.230 --> 01:01:26.240 align:start position:0%
off the wall question but i i would
 
01:01:28.630 --> 01:01:28.640 align:start position:0%
appreciate that
 
01:01:31.670 --> 01:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
and if someone wants a piece of property
 
01:01:34.950 --> 01:01:34.960 align:start position:0%
they just let you know
 
01:01:36.390 --> 01:01:36.400 align:start position:0%
that that'd be one way most of the
 
01:01:40.549 --> 01:01:40.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:42.390 --> 01:01:42.400 align:start position:0%
that aren't contiguous there are certain
 
01:01:44.630 --> 01:01:44.640 align:start position:0%
parcels that that really only have value
 
01:01:47.109 --> 01:01:47.119 align:start position:0%
of benefit to an immediate a butter
 
01:01:48.789 --> 01:01:48.799 align:start position:0%
because the access and other things any
 
01:01:51.670 --> 01:01:51.680 align:start position:0%
of the ones that are
 
01:01:53.589 --> 01:01:53.599 align:start position:0%
marketable uh
 
01:01:56.309 --> 01:01:56.319 align:start position:0%
we we typically um work through a
 
01:01:58.789 --> 01:01:58.799 align:start position:0%
realtor to market and and
 
01:02:01.510 --> 01:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
and sell so through either contacting us
 
01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:02.630 align:start position:0%
and sell so through either contacting us
or

01:02:02.630 --> 01:02:02.640 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:02:04.630 --> 01:02:04.640 align:start position:0%
through the realtor that's marketing the
 
01:02:06.470 --> 01:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
property if somebody's interested they
 
01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:07.190 align:start position:0%
property if somebody's interested they
can

01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:07.200 align:start position:0%
can
 
01:02:09.349 --> 01:02:09.359 align:start position:0%
get in touch that way okay
 
01:02:10.309 --> 01:02:10.319 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:02:13.750 --> 01:02:13.760 align:start position:0%

so when you're coming up for the
 
01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:19.510 align:start position:0%
so when you're coming up for the
roundabout

roundabout
 
01:02:21.910 --> 01:02:21.920 align:start position:0%

okay
 
01:02:50.710 --> 01:02:50.720 align:start position:0%
so uh representative turcotte you had
 
01:02:54.710 --> 01:02:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:56.069 --> 01:02:56.079 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair yes i would like
 
01:02:56.079 --> 01:02:56.789 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair yes i would like
to

01:02:56.789 --> 01:02:56.799 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:02:56.799 --> 01:03:01.670 align:start position:0%
to
um

01:03:01.670 --> 01:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:04.390 --> 01:03:04.400 align:start position:0%
having heard
 
01:03:06.549 --> 01:03:06.559 align:start position:0%
the this information today really for
 
01:03:09.510 --> 01:03:09.520 align:start position:0%
the first time really and for me
 
01:03:11.190 --> 01:03:11.200 align:start position:0%
creates as many questions as there are
 
01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:12.230 align:start position:0%
creates as many questions as there are
answers

01:03:12.230 --> 01:03:12.240 align:start position:0%
answers
 
01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:13.910 align:start position:0%
answers
um

01:03:13.910 --> 01:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:16.309 --> 01:03:16.319 align:start position:0%
we learned that uh both the senate and
 
01:03:18.150 --> 01:03:18.160 align:start position:0%
the house felt this road shouldn't be in
 
01:03:19.750 --> 01:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
the 10-year plan
 
01:03:20.789 --> 01:03:20.799 align:start position:0%
that was
 
01:03:20.799 --> 01:03:22.230 align:start position:0%
that was
pretty

01:03:22.230 --> 01:03:22.240 align:start position:0%
pretty
 
01:03:27.349 --> 01:03:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:29.430 --> 01:03:29.440 align:start position:0%
some of the language in the bill i find
 
01:03:31.589 --> 01:03:31.599 align:start position:0%
a little bit too vague financing must be
 
01:03:34.309 --> 01:03:34.319 align:start position:0%
sufficient you know what's that mean
 
01:03:36.150 --> 01:03:36.160 align:start position:0%
sufficient to what that's not very
 
01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:37.829 align:start position:0%
sufficient to what that's not very
specific

01:03:37.829 --> 01:03:37.839 align:start position:0%
specific
 
01:03:37.839 --> 01:03:39.270 align:start position:0%
specific
um

01:03:39.270 --> 01:03:39.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:41.910 --> 01:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
the other thing um when we calculate 4
 
01:03:43.990 --> 01:03:44.000 align:start position:0%
million when you're talking about a 200
 
01:03:45.990 --> 01:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
million dollar project that's about two
 
01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:47.910 align:start position:0%
million dollar project that's about two
percent

01:03:47.910 --> 01:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:03:49.990 --> 01:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
of a project
 
01:03:51.990 --> 01:03:52.000 align:start position:0%
i i find it
 
01:03:53.430 --> 01:03:53.440 align:start position:0%
since the
 
01:03:54.870 --> 01:03:54.880 align:start position:0%
senate in the house has already found
 
01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:55.750 align:start position:0%
senate in the house has already found
that

01:03:55.750 --> 01:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:03:57.910 --> 01:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't be fixing that road or
 
01:04:00.069 --> 01:04:00.079 align:start position:0%
using our money in the 10-year plan i
 
01:04:02.630 --> 01:04:02.640 align:start position:0%
find it um
 
01:04:04.150 --> 01:04:04.160 align:start position:0%
i don't see a reason why we should be
 
01:04:05.510 --> 01:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
doing that
 
01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:06.549 align:start position:0%
doing that
um

01:04:06.549 --> 01:04:06.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:09.190 --> 01:04:09.200 align:start position:0%
if now just just a minute
 
01:04:12.309 --> 01:04:12.319 align:start position:0%
if i could i understand yeah mr cass
 
01:04:15.990 --> 01:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
would you mind explaining about roads
 
01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:16.950 align:start position:0%
would you mind explaining about roads
that

01:04:16.950 --> 01:04:16.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:19.589 align:start position:0%
that
are

01:04:19.589 --> 01:04:19.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:21.349 --> 01:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
currently state roads but you want to
 
01:04:23.589 --> 01:04:23.599 align:start position:0%
get rid of them
 
01:04:23.599 --> 01:04:24.829 align:start position:0%
get rid of them
you

01:04:24.829 --> 01:04:24.839 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:04:28.150 --> 01:04:28.160 align:start position:0%
know and i and i think that
 
01:04:28.950 --> 01:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
and i
 
01:04:32.549 --> 01:04:32.559 align:start position:0%
i asked this question because i think it
 
01:04:35.510 --> 01:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
will help you understand
 
01:04:38.309 --> 01:04:38.319 align:start position:0%
okay maybe maybe not i i mean i
 
01:04:39.510 --> 01:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
understand where you're coming from but
 
01:04:41.029 --> 01:04:41.039 align:start position:0%
i i just want to make sure that
 
01:04:42.630 --> 01:04:42.640 align:start position:0%
everybody knows
 
01:04:45.910 --> 01:04:45.920 align:start position:0%
what what this is all about
 
01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:46.950 align:start position:0%
what what this is all about
so

01:04:46.950 --> 01:04:46.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:04:50.069 --> 01:04:50.079 align:start position:0%
so typically if we're going to um
 
01:04:52.870 --> 01:04:52.880 align:start position:0%
abandon or or reclassify a road it's
 
01:04:54.710 --> 01:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
called just discontinuing the road in
 
01:04:56.630 --> 01:04:56.640 align:start position:0%
other words we divest ourselves and say
 
01:04:58.870 --> 01:04:58.880 align:start position:0%
it has no more
 
01:05:00.710 --> 01:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
uh use as part of the state highway
 
01:05:03.589 --> 01:05:03.599 align:start position:0%
system so we discontinue it
 
01:05:03.599 --> 01:05:04.630 align:start position:0%
system so we discontinue it
um

01:05:04.630 --> 01:05:04.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:05.990 align:start position:0%
um
typically

01:05:05.990 --> 01:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
typically
 
01:05:08.470 --> 01:05:08.480 align:start position:0%
that discontinuance would go first to
 
01:05:10.069 --> 01:05:10.079 align:start position:0%
the town
 
01:05:12.150 --> 01:05:12.160 align:start position:0%
or in the case of dixville where there
 
01:05:14.470 --> 01:05:14.480 align:start position:0%
isn't an incorporated town it would go
 
01:05:16.710 --> 01:05:16.720 align:start position:0%
to the to the county
 
01:05:18.470 --> 01:05:18.480 align:start position:0%
actually i think parts of the road are
 
01:05:20.710 --> 01:05:20.720 align:start position:0%
in colebrook so between colebrook and
 
01:05:23.750 --> 01:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
and coast county serving as the
 
01:05:25.910 --> 01:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
administrative body for
 
01:05:28.789 --> 01:05:28.799 align:start position:0%
dixville dixville notch um
 
01:05:30.150 --> 01:05:30.160 align:start position:0%
they would have to determine whether it
 
01:05:33.430 --> 01:05:33.440 align:start position:0%
is of interest to uh the
 
01:05:36.710 --> 01:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
municipality if they wouldn't then then
 
01:05:38.789 --> 01:05:38.799 align:start position:0%
they would also discontinue
 
01:05:41.029 --> 01:05:41.039 align:start position:0%
any um
 
01:05:43.589 --> 01:05:43.599 align:start position:0%
municipal interests in it and it would
 
01:05:45.589 --> 01:05:45.599 align:start position:0%
then revert to the underlying property
 
01:05:45.599 --> 01:05:47.109 align:start position:0%
then revert to the underlying property
owner

01:05:47.109 --> 01:05:47.119 align:start position:0%
owner
 
01:05:51.190 --> 01:05:51.200 align:start position:0%
a lot of times when um when when we
 
01:05:54.069 --> 01:05:54.079 align:start position:0%
either discontinue or class or
 
01:05:55.670 --> 01:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
reclassify a road it's going to be a
 
01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:56.630 align:start position:0%
reclassify a road it's going to be a
class

01:05:56.630 --> 01:05:56.640 align:start position:0%
class
 
01:05:59.270 --> 01:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
4 road we're doing that currently and
 
01:06:01.109 --> 01:06:01.119 align:start position:0%
we've done that currently in berlin a
 
01:06:03.430 --> 01:06:03.440 align:start position:0%
section of 110
 
01:06:05.750 --> 01:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
i think part of the um what we've
 
01:06:07.910 --> 01:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
typically tried to do is
 
01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:09.109 align:start position:0%
typically tried to do is
um

01:06:09.109 --> 01:06:09.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:10.870 --> 01:06:10.880 align:start position:0%
do some sort of maintenance upgrade so
 
01:06:13.029 --> 01:06:13.039 align:start position:0%
it's turned over to the town in a
 
01:06:16.549 --> 01:06:16.559 align:start position:0%
reasonable or serviceable condition
 
01:06:20.150 --> 01:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
and back five or five five five
 
01:06:22.309 --> 01:06:22.319 align:start position:0%
five or so years ago when this
 
01:06:25.910 --> 01:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
golf links road project was um
 
01:06:28.549 --> 01:06:28.559 align:start position:0%
first um
 
01:06:30.390 --> 01:06:30.400 align:start position:0%
uh brokered or entered into the 10-year
 
01:06:32.150 --> 01:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
plan that was kind of the philosophy
 
01:06:34.230 --> 01:06:34.240 align:start position:0%
behind it that we would
 
01:06:35.270 --> 01:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
we would
 
01:06:37.589 --> 01:06:37.599 align:start position:0%
um upgrade um
 
01:06:40.549 --> 01:06:40.559 align:start position:0%
up upgrade golf links road in order to
 
01:06:42.710 --> 01:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
turn it over and get it off the state's
 
01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:44.390 align:start position:0%
turn it over and get it off the state's
books

01:06:44.390 --> 01:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
books
 
01:06:46.630 --> 01:06:46.640 align:start position:0%
so that that that
 
01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:47.750 align:start position:0%
so that that that
principle

01:06:47.750 --> 01:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
principle
 
01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:49.349 align:start position:0%
principle
of

01:06:49.349 --> 01:06:49.359 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:06:52.230 --> 01:06:52.240 align:start position:0%
uh of uh
 
01:06:53.589 --> 01:06:53.599 align:start position:0%
leaving a road in a serviceable
 
01:06:55.510 --> 01:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
condition is is
 
01:06:59.190 --> 01:06:59.200 align:start position:0%
um kind of what we typically try to do
 
01:07:01.430 --> 01:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
if it is going to be that's typically if
 
01:07:04.630 --> 01:07:04.640 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a municipal um
 
01:07:07.349 --> 01:07:07.359 align:start position:0%
road or county road or county road right
 
01:07:07.359 --> 01:07:08.230 align:start position:0%
road or county road or county road right
okay

01:07:08.230 --> 01:07:08.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:07:10.549 --> 01:07:10.559 align:start position:0%
okay does that help i don't know if that
 
01:07:13.430 --> 01:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
was your questions but
 
01:07:15.190 --> 01:07:15.200 align:start position:0%
it's additional information that doesn't
 
01:07:17.430 --> 01:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
make the point i was going to make but
 
01:07:20.390 --> 01:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:23.510 --> 01:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
so what i was continuing where thank you
 
01:07:25.750 --> 01:07:25.760 align:start position:0%
uh my point where i was going with this
 
01:07:28.470 --> 01:07:28.480 align:start position:0%
is um
 
01:07:30.950 --> 01:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
there are many ways to skin the cat
 
01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:33.109 align:start position:0%
there are many ways to skin the cat
um

01:07:33.109 --> 01:07:33.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:36.390 --> 01:07:36.400 align:start position:0%
i think uh attorneys at the d.o.t
 
01:07:39.670 --> 01:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
or attorneys in the house or by doing
 
01:07:42.549 --> 01:07:42.559 align:start position:0%
legislation i'm sure we could come up
 
01:07:44.230 --> 01:07:44.240 align:start position:0%
with a way
 
01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:45.109 align:start position:0%
with a way
uh

01:07:45.109 --> 01:07:45.119 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:07:48.470 --> 01:07:48.480 align:start position:0%
on a one-time basis that this
 
01:07:50.870 --> 01:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
road could be transferred eventually to
 
01:07:53.510 --> 01:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
the developer if that was the
 
01:07:55.349 --> 01:07:55.359 align:start position:0%
um desire
 
01:07:59.910 --> 01:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:03.910 --> 01:08:03.920 align:start position:0%
the problem i have is spending taxpayers
 
01:08:05.829 --> 01:08:05.839 align:start position:0%
monies for four million dollars to
 
01:08:08.230 --> 01:08:08.240 align:start position:0%
upgrade a road that the developer
 
01:08:10.230 --> 01:08:10.240 align:start position:0%
himself believes and don't get me wrong
 
01:08:12.150 --> 01:08:12.160 align:start position:0%
i'm off for development and you you guys
 
01:08:14.150 --> 01:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
fix up this road and you put some house
 
01:08:15.510 --> 01:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
slots up there i'll come up and look one
 
01:08:18.550 --> 01:08:18.560 align:start position:0%
maybe i'll even buy one but that when
 
01:08:20.309 --> 01:08:20.319 align:start position:0%
you're developing a road like that four
 
01:08:21.910 --> 01:08:21.920 align:start position:0%
million dollars where it represents less
 
01:08:25.110 --> 01:08:25.120 align:start position:0%
than two percent of the total project
 
01:08:27.749 --> 01:08:27.759 align:start position:0%
and in the end if it is developed
 
01:08:30.309 --> 01:08:30.319 align:start position:0%
properly uh with house lots for second
 
01:08:31.910 --> 01:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
homes and all that that money is going
 
01:08:35.829 --> 01:08:35.839 align:start position:0%
to be recouped uh quite nicely so
 
01:08:37.269 --> 01:08:37.279 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm just saying i think there
 
01:08:39.189 --> 01:08:39.199 align:start position:0%
are other ways to do this without the
 
01:08:41.749 --> 01:08:41.759 align:start position:0%
state first putting four million dollars
 
01:08:43.749 --> 01:08:43.759 align:start position:0%
into the project then handing it over i
 
01:08:44.789 --> 01:08:44.799 align:start position:0%
think there are other ways that we could
 
01:08:47.030 --> 01:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
probably to find a way to hand
 
01:08:49.269 --> 01:08:49.279 align:start position:0%
that prop that road over and let the
 
01:08:49.279 --> 01:08:50.870 align:start position:0%
that prop that road over and let the
developer

01:08:50.870 --> 01:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
developer
 
01:08:53.749 --> 01:08:53.759 align:start position:0%
be responsible for the development of it
 
01:08:57.349 --> 01:08:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:59.110 --> 01:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
are there further comments reps
 
01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:00.870 align:start position:0%
are there further comments reps
underneath

01:09:00.870 --> 01:09:00.880 align:start position:0%
underneath
 
01:09:03.349 --> 01:09:03.359 align:start position:0%
my question is one um
 
01:09:06.470 --> 01:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
simply to ask how much would it cost
 
01:09:09.829 --> 01:09:09.839 align:start position:0%
to make that road ready to turn over
 
01:09:12.229 --> 01:09:12.239 align:start position:0%
that's the four point that's the 4.1
 
01:09:14.390 --> 01:09:14.400 align:start position:0%
million dollars thank you the estimated
 
01:09:16.149 --> 01:09:16.159 align:start position:0%
cost i mean
 
01:09:19.110 --> 01:09:19.120 align:start position:0%
you know it could be 2 million
 
01:09:21.349 --> 01:09:21.359 align:start position:0%
or it could be
 
01:09:24.070 --> 01:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
the state is only in this
 
01:09:25.990 --> 01:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
we're only ever going to be responsible
 
01:09:28.870 --> 01:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
for 4.1 no matter what happens with
 
01:09:31.030 --> 01:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
inflation represent
 
01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:31.990 align:start position:0%
inflation represent
oh

01:09:31.990 --> 01:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
oh
 
01:09:33.590 --> 01:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
i just had one one other comment that
 
01:09:35.110 --> 01:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
i've written down
 
01:09:37.030 --> 01:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
and that is the state of the project
 
01:09:39.030 --> 01:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
right now i mean it's
 
01:09:40.870 --> 01:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
i mean i know everybody's excited about
 
01:09:43.110 --> 01:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
it coming up and being developed but
 
01:09:45.590 --> 01:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
it's still really at the infancy
 
01:09:49.110 --> 01:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
so uh to be tossing another potential 4
 
01:09:51.669 --> 01:09:51.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:53.749 --> 01:09:53.759 align:start position:0%
at some roads i just
 
01:09:55.270 --> 01:09:55.280 align:start position:0%
and i know there are some caveats in
 
01:09:57.030 --> 01:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
there but i'm still
 
01:10:00.830 --> 01:10:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:03.189 --> 01:10:03.199 align:start position:0%
representative thank you commander chair
 
01:10:05.110 --> 01:10:05.120 align:start position:0%
uh well this
 
01:10:06.550 --> 01:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
project will let's
 
01:10:10.310 --> 01:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
do the road that's gravel now
 
01:10:12.310 --> 01:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
so in other words no but the whole road
 
01:10:13.990 --> 01:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
will be taken over by the town or
 
01:10:17.270 --> 01:10:17.280 align:start position:0%
whoever the county
 
01:10:21.110 --> 01:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
if i understood what the
 
01:10:23.350 --> 01:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
commissioner said
 
01:10:27.430 --> 01:10:27.440 align:start position:0%
there is a portion of dirt road
 
01:10:29.510 --> 01:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
in colebrook
 
01:10:32.790 --> 01:10:32.800 align:start position:0%
that colebrook will do something
 
01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:35.189 align:start position:0%
that colebrook will do something
about

01:10:35.189 --> 01:10:35.199 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:10:37.030 --> 01:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
01:10:39.669 --> 01:10:39.679 align:start position:0%
we've already transferred it
 
01:10:45.669 --> 01:10:45.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:47.350 --> 01:10:47.360 align:start position:0%
commissioner gorman
 
01:10:49.030 --> 01:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
the town of colebrook
 
01:10:50.870 --> 01:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
worked with mr arton several years ago
 
01:10:53.669 --> 01:10:53.679 align:start position:0%
because it's been going on for a while
 
01:10:56.630 --> 01:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
the dirt road section that what i call
 
01:10:57.990 --> 01:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
the right off them just before the
 
01:10:59.750 --> 01:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
country club the town of colbert has
 
01:11:01.110 --> 01:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
already worked with
 
01:11:03.910 --> 01:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
developer autumn to turn that section of
 
01:11:06.790 --> 01:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
road over to him okay so we we would be
 
01:11:09.430 --> 01:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
looking for the state to to do as the
 
01:11:11.110 --> 01:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
process i believe is
 
01:11:12.870 --> 01:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
set up now that they would the state
 
01:11:15.510 --> 01:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
would fix do its obligations fix up the
 
01:11:17.430 --> 01:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
road and i believe the process will be
 
01:11:18.950 --> 01:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
that they'll turn it over to the town of
 
01:11:20.790 --> 01:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
colebrook in the county i think i can
 
01:11:22.310 --> 01:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
speak as a selectmen and as a
 
01:11:23.990 --> 01:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner we would then do the
 
01:11:25.270 --> 01:11:25.280 align:start position:0%
process of turning it over to the
 
01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:26.550 align:start position:0%
process of turning it over to the
developer

01:11:26.550 --> 01:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
developer
 
01:11:28.709 --> 01:11:28.719 align:start position:0%
that's that's how i see this happening
 
01:11:29.910 --> 01:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
the way it's being proposed at the
 
01:11:32.550 --> 01:11:32.560 align:start position:0%
moment okay um
 
01:11:34.470 --> 01:11:34.480 align:start position:0%
so any other
 
01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:36.149 align:start position:0%
so any other
questions

01:11:36.149 --> 01:11:36.159 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:11:38.390 --> 01:11:38.400 align:start position:0%
so you mentioned just a second you
 
01:11:40.709 --> 01:11:40.719 align:start position:0%
mentioned this morning about a dirt road
 
01:11:42.070 --> 01:11:42.080 align:start position:0%
in in
 
01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:43.350 align:start position:0%
in in
colebrook

01:11:43.350 --> 01:11:43.360 align:start position:0%
colebrook
 
01:11:45.750 --> 01:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
is cold work going to
 
01:11:47.910 --> 01:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
put that road
 
01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:49.030 align:start position:0%
put that road
to

01:11:49.030 --> 01:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:11:51.350 --> 01:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
it was good enough for what they needed
 
01:11:53.030 --> 01:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
and what they've been using for the last
 
01:11:56.070 --> 01:11:56.080 align:start position:0%
few years i think part of the situation
 
01:11:58.870 --> 01:11:58.880 align:start position:0%
with the reason we did it part of it as
 
01:12:01.270 --> 01:12:01.280 align:start position:0%
quickly was the plans to put the real
 
01:12:03.430 --> 01:12:03.440 align:start position:0%
estate in there they wanted to put side
 
01:12:05.030 --> 01:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
roads they wanted to do things
 
01:12:07.590 --> 01:12:07.600 align:start position:0%
differently so by us doing what we
 
01:12:10.149 --> 01:12:10.159 align:start position:0%
needed to do to turn it over all right
 
01:12:12.550 --> 01:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
they're still going to come in that end
 
01:12:14.310 --> 01:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
of the golf course we'll still come into
 
01:12:17.590 --> 01:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
the town of colebrook's road town road
 
01:12:19.910 --> 01:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
okay and that the town road is dirt
 
01:12:21.510 --> 01:12:21.520 align:start position:0%
there's part of it that there still will
 
01:12:23.350 --> 01:12:23.360 align:start position:0%
be we own
 
01:12:27.030 --> 01:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
this not on the balsam's property per se
 
01:12:28.950 --> 01:12:28.960 align:start position:0%
what was on the balsam's property we got
 
01:12:30.870 --> 01:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
it set to the way that the condition i
 
01:12:33.590 --> 01:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
got all that i'm i'm i'm talking about
 
01:12:35.990 --> 01:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
is colebrook planning to upgrade that
 
01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.790 align:start position:0%
is colebrook planning to upgrade that
road

01:12:38.790 --> 01:12:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:41.189 --> 01:12:41.199 align:start position:0%
that's in colebrook
 
01:12:43.669 --> 01:12:43.679 align:start position:0%
that's a possibility if if the traffic
 
01:12:43.679 --> 01:12:44.870 align:start position:0%
that's a possibility if if the traffic
increases

01:12:44.870 --> 01:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
increases
 
01:12:46.470 --> 01:12:46.480 align:start position:0%
and so on and so forth
 
01:12:48.630 --> 01:12:48.640 align:start position:0%
we'll see what the future brings if we
 
01:12:51.030 --> 01:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
need to widen the road or
 
01:12:53.189 --> 01:12:53.199 align:start position:0%
do better job of culverts we will do it
 
01:12:55.030 --> 01:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
we we've if there's real estate
 
01:12:57.110 --> 01:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
development and it is a town road we
 
01:12:59.750 --> 01:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
will do our what is responsible okay
 
01:13:02.310 --> 01:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
okay we're very very committed to this
 
01:13:05.030 --> 01:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
the economics for us on this
 
01:13:08.229 --> 01:13:08.239 align:start position:0%
is huge huge huge i can't say it enough
 
01:13:08.239 --> 01:13:09.110 align:start position:0%
is huge huge huge i can't say it enough
god

01:13:09.110 --> 01:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
god
 
01:13:09.990 --> 01:13:10.000 align:start position:0%
got it
 
01:13:12.709 --> 01:13:12.719 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else
 
01:13:17.750 --> 01:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:21.750 --> 01:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:25.189 --> 01:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
um i did speak to mr arton while you
 
01:13:28.310 --> 01:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
guys were having lunch and i think mr
 
01:13:30.149 --> 01:13:30.159 align:start position:0%
cat commissioner cass
 
01:13:32.470 --> 01:13:32.480 align:start position:0%
back when these negotiations were done
 
01:13:36.310 --> 01:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
in 14 and 15. as i understand it it was
 
01:13:38.950 --> 01:13:38.960 align:start position:0%
part of a bigger situation
 
01:13:40.470 --> 01:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
for example
 
01:13:43.430 --> 01:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
the state had
 
01:13:46.709 --> 01:13:46.719 align:start position:0%
owned the bolson's property garages for
 
01:13:50.070 --> 01:13:50.080 align:start position:0%
their vehicles and a place for salt and
 
01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:51.110 align:start position:0%
their vehicles and a place for salt and
sand

01:13:51.110 --> 01:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
sand
 
01:13:53.510 --> 01:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
and it's part of this whole thing the
 
01:13:56.070 --> 01:13:56.080 align:start position:0%
state would turn over the road to the
 
01:13:58.229 --> 01:13:58.239 align:start position:0%
county then to the developer the
 
01:14:00.070 --> 01:14:00.080 align:start position:0%
developer would then continue to
 
01:14:01.750 --> 01:14:01.760 align:start position:0%
maintain the road
 
01:14:03.189 --> 01:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:14:04.790 --> 01:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
the developer
 
01:14:09.590 --> 01:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
would and has actually given property to
 
01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:10.709 align:start position:0%
would and has actually given property to
the

01:14:10.709 --> 01:14:10.719 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:14:10.719 --> 01:14:11.910 align:start position:0%
the
state

01:14:11.910 --> 01:14:11.920 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:14:14.070 --> 01:14:14.080 align:start position:0%
at the bottom of the property now in
 
01:14:16.390 --> 01:14:16.400 align:start position:0%
order to do their vehicle keep their
 
01:14:18.070 --> 01:14:18.080 align:start position:0%
garage for their vehicles you're seeing
 
01:14:20.709 --> 01:14:20.719 align:start position:0%
in the assault it was up on spur road
 
01:14:22.229 --> 01:14:22.239 align:start position:0%
which was a little if you've been to the
 
01:14:23.830 --> 01:14:23.840 align:start position:0%
ball since it was a little bit farther
 
01:14:27.270 --> 01:14:27.280 align:start position:0%
up there he then deeded them property
 
01:14:30.149 --> 01:14:30.159 align:start position:0%
down below as part of this bigger
 
01:14:32.550 --> 01:14:32.560 align:start position:0%
situation i think there's a lot of
 
01:14:35.270 --> 01:14:35.280 align:start position:0%
a lot of moving parts with i think with
 
01:14:36.709 --> 01:14:36.719 align:start position:0%
with d.o.t
 
01:14:36.719 --> 01:14:37.590 align:start position:0%
with d.o.t
um

01:14:37.590 --> 01:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:38.550 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:14:38.550 --> 01:14:38.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:14:40.709 --> 01:14:40.719 align:start position:0%
to your question the developer has
 
01:14:43.910 --> 01:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
already given land to the state at no
 
01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:45.110 align:start position:0%
already given land to the state at no
charge

01:14:45.110 --> 01:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
charge
 
01:14:47.830 --> 01:14:47.840 align:start position:0%
and where they are now housing
 
01:14:50.630 --> 01:14:50.640 align:start position:0%
d.o.t vehicles salt and sand et cetera
 
01:14:53.350 --> 01:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
and all we're looking for in this is
 
01:14:55.270 --> 01:14:55.280 align:start position:0%
really just for the state to get the
 
01:14:57.990 --> 01:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
road not up to the standards
 
01:14:59.830 --> 01:14:59.840 align:start position:0%
that we have now but i think it's an
 
01:15:01.430 --> 01:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
18-foot road
 
01:15:03.350 --> 01:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
i think it's maybe an 18-foot road and
 
01:15:05.510 --> 01:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
it's just getting it back i think now
 
01:15:08.149 --> 01:15:08.159 align:start position:0%
you have to be 24 feet or 22 feet but
 
01:15:10.630 --> 01:15:10.640 align:start position:0%
it's getting it back to just being being
 
01:15:13.830 --> 01:15:13.840 align:start position:0%
surfaceable and unusable and when you
 
01:15:15.510 --> 01:15:15.520 align:start position:0%
think about it
 
01:15:18.790 --> 01:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
if the state decided to keep the road
 
01:15:20.470 --> 01:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
they've got to go through private
 
01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:22.550 align:start position:0%
they've got to go through private
property

01:15:22.550 --> 01:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
property
 
01:15:24.470 --> 01:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
i mean if they don't turn it over it's
 
01:15:25.910 --> 01:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
comp the whole thing is really
 
01:15:28.950 --> 01:15:28.960 align:start position:0%
complicated so i think it
 
01:15:31.270 --> 01:15:31.280 align:start position:0%
yeah it's just a lot of moving parts so
 
01:15:33.110 --> 01:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
i think this from the state's
 
01:15:35.590 --> 01:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
perspective as mr otton said they're the
 
01:15:37.270 --> 01:15:37.280 align:start position:0%
ones who said best thing to do was put
 
01:15:39.270 --> 01:15:39.280 align:start position:0%
in the 10-year plan it makes sense they
 
01:15:41.750 --> 01:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
took it out because they took it out
 
01:15:44.870 --> 01:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
during covert nothing was moving and why
 
01:15:47.189 --> 01:15:47.199 align:start position:0%
hold up money when you can do other
 
01:15:50.310 --> 01:15:50.320 align:start position:0%
projects and now that covet hopefully is
 
01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:51.669 align:start position:0%
projects and now that covet hopefully is
over

01:15:51.669 --> 01:15:51.679 align:start position:0%
over
 
01:15:54.070 --> 01:15:54.080 align:start position:0%
and the financing looks like it's closer
 
01:15:56.229 --> 01:15:56.239 align:start position:0%
to being in um
 
01:15:58.229 --> 01:15:58.239 align:start position:0%
in place it made sense to look at it
 
01:16:00.070 --> 01:16:00.080 align:start position:0%
through general funds if you have if you
 
01:16:02.229 --> 01:16:02.239 align:start position:0%
have the money and
 
01:16:05.430 --> 01:16:05.440 align:start position:0%
let me be clear if we've done our job
 
01:16:07.910 --> 01:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
meaning the financing and the permit and
 
01:16:09.669 --> 01:16:09.679 align:start position:0%
it's very clear in there we have to have
 
01:16:12.790 --> 01:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
secured financing
 
01:16:15.189 --> 01:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy and i did i misspeak did i
 
01:16:17.270 --> 01:16:17.280 align:start position:0%
get that right
 
01:16:18.709 --> 01:16:18.719 align:start position:0%
i might not right
 
01:16:30.229 --> 01:16:30.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:32.630 --> 01:16:32.640 align:start position:0%
there was there was an exchange
 
01:16:36.149 --> 01:16:36.159 align:start position:0%
there was an exchange for the um
 
01:16:38.070 --> 01:16:38.080 align:start position:0%
for the uh patrol shed that's there so
 
01:16:40.630 --> 01:16:40.640 align:start position:0%
we have we have a building where uh we
 
01:16:42.870 --> 01:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
have two bays where we keep a truck that
 
01:16:45.189 --> 01:16:45.199 align:start position:0%
helps maintain the the notch so it's our
 
01:16:46.950 --> 01:16:46.960 align:start position:0%
building but it is on the on the
 
01:16:48.870 --> 01:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
balsam's property and
 
01:16:51.750 --> 01:16:51.760 align:start position:0%
like i said the the historic
 
01:16:53.750 --> 01:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
handshake agreements between why it's
 
01:16:56.070 --> 01:16:56.080 align:start position:0%
still a state road and stuff
 
01:16:57.830 --> 01:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
lingers to this day but
 
01:16:57.840 --> 01:16:58.709 align:start position:0%
lingers to this day but
um

01:16:58.709 --> 01:16:58.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:00.950 --> 01:17:00.960 align:start position:0%
we did uh we didn't negotiate a
 
01:17:03.990 --> 01:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
transaction with mr rotten in boston so
 
01:17:06.470 --> 01:17:06.480 align:start position:0%
there was a piece of land on valley road
 
01:17:07.669 --> 01:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
where we're going to be building a new
 
01:17:09.030 --> 01:17:09.040 align:start position:0%
patrol shed
 
01:17:10.950 --> 01:17:10.960 align:start position:0%
it was just awarded um
 
01:17:12.310 --> 01:17:12.320 align:start position:0%
the bids were just open it's going to be
 
01:17:13.590 --> 01:17:13.600 align:start position:0%
awarded that the next governor and
 
01:17:15.990 --> 01:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
council in exchange for that uh we
 
01:17:18.870 --> 01:17:18.880 align:start position:0%
negotiated an easement uh for for the
 
01:17:20.229 --> 01:17:20.239 align:start position:0%
water line
 
01:17:22.950 --> 01:17:22.960 align:start position:0%
that's through our um that that's coming
 
01:17:25.590 --> 01:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
uh through our uh
 
01:17:28.630 --> 01:17:28.640 align:start position:0%
patrol shed property down in arrow so it
 
01:17:29.990 --> 01:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
wasn't so
 
01:17:31.990 --> 01:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
that was a little bit separate but but
 
01:17:33.669 --> 01:17:33.679 align:start position:0%
it is but it is
 
01:17:35.510 --> 01:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of interrelated parts you are
 
01:17:38.229 --> 01:17:38.239 align:start position:0%
correct yeah and and i think as mr ogden
 
01:17:40.630 --> 01:17:40.640 align:start position:0%
said all of these various transactions
 
01:17:43.110 --> 01:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
are separate but it was all part of an
 
01:17:45.990 --> 01:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
overall negotiation and conversation
 
01:17:49.350 --> 01:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
with d.o.t as to how we you know
 
01:17:51.510 --> 01:17:51.520 align:start position:0%
we meet their needs meet our needs and
 
01:17:53.830 --> 01:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
we get the state more money
 
01:17:53.840 --> 01:17:54.950 align:start position:0%
we get the state more money
from

01:17:54.950 --> 01:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:17:54.960 --> 01:18:01.590 align:start position:0%
from
bpt

01:18:01.590 --> 01:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:03.669 --> 01:18:03.679 align:start position:0%
mr tillerson certainly did some
 
01:18:08.709 --> 01:18:08.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:10.390 --> 01:18:10.400 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead
 
01:18:14.070 --> 01:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
i just permission for mr cass
 
01:18:14.080 --> 01:18:16.149 align:start position:0%
i just permission for mr cass
um

01:18:16.149 --> 01:18:16.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:17.750 --> 01:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
this amendment says that the department
 
01:18:19.430 --> 01:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
of transportation will do the
 
01:18:21.270 --> 01:18:21.280 align:start position:0%
construction so does that mean that this
 
01:18:23.430 --> 01:18:23.440 align:start position:0%
road is going to be built up to current
 
01:18:23.440 --> 01:18:26.310 align:start position:0%
road is going to be built up to current
standards

01:18:26.310 --> 01:18:26.320 align:start position:0%
standards
 
01:18:29.110 --> 01:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
it's okay well i i just heard i'm gonna
 
01:18:31.110 --> 01:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
follow him i just heard that it was just
 
01:18:33.189 --> 01:18:33.199 align:start position:0%
gonna be
 
01:18:35.990 --> 01:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
you know serviceable at the surface and
 
01:18:38.790 --> 01:18:38.800 align:start position:0%
it's gonna need it's gonna need more
 
01:18:41.910 --> 01:18:41.920 align:start position:0%
uh gra gravel and stone underneath so
 
01:18:43.030 --> 01:18:43.040 align:start position:0%
that it's
 
01:18:44.630 --> 01:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
so that it's come up comes up to
 
01:18:51.669 --> 01:18:51.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:52.950 --> 01:18:52.960 align:start position:0%
yeah we're
 
01:18:55.910 --> 01:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
that's okay i'm sorry jumping jack
 
01:18:58.950 --> 01:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
we had developed a project in 2016 that
 
01:19:02.229 --> 01:19:02.239 align:start position:0%
we were ready to ready to bid um
 
01:19:04.310 --> 01:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
and it called for i think reclaiming the
 
01:19:06.390 --> 01:19:06.400 align:start position:0%
the pavement surface putting in some
 
01:19:08.070 --> 01:19:08.080 align:start position:0%
drainage it wasn't complete
 
01:19:10.229 --> 01:19:10.239 align:start position:0%
reconstruction of the road
 
01:19:10.239 --> 01:19:11.189 align:start position:0%
reconstruction of the road
and

01:19:11.189 --> 01:19:11.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:19:13.189 --> 01:19:13.199 align:start position:0%
uh when we say up this up the standards
 
01:19:15.750 --> 01:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
it was the standards of i i believe miss
 
01:19:17.750 --> 01:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
rosenberg said 18 i forget it was either
 
01:19:20.870 --> 01:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
16 or 18 feet it it wasn't uh it was
 
01:19:23.430 --> 01:19:23.440 align:start position:0%
more of a it was more of like a park
 
01:19:25.510 --> 01:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
road typical than a than a state highway
 
01:19:28.390 --> 01:19:28.400 align:start position:0%
type of typical but it did involve
 
01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:29.430 align:start position:0%
type of typical but it did involve
um

01:19:29.430 --> 01:19:29.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:32.470 --> 01:19:32.480 align:start position:0%
a reclaimed surface and repaving with
 
01:19:34.310 --> 01:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
some drainage additions to make it
 
01:19:37.110 --> 01:19:37.120 align:start position:0%
functional that was the plan that we had
 
01:19:39.270 --> 01:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
been prepared to bid and i believe that
 
01:19:41.189 --> 01:19:41.199 align:start position:0%
would still be the plan that we would uh
 
01:19:43.830 --> 01:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
put forward if it was funded
 
01:19:46.070 --> 01:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
and that's what the cost estimate that
 
01:19:51.189 --> 01:19:51.199 align:start position:0%
you have been referring to reflects
 
01:19:52.229 --> 01:19:52.239 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:19:52.239 --> 01:19:53.669 align:start position:0%
follow up
sure

01:19:53.669 --> 01:19:53.679 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:19:53.679 --> 01:19:55.590 align:start position:0%
sure
um

01:19:55.590 --> 01:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:55.600 --> 01:19:56.310 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:19:56.310 --> 01:19:56.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:19:59.189 --> 01:19:59.199 align:start position:0%
will it will the road hold up under the
 
01:20:02.149 --> 01:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
being under those conditions yes
 
01:20:07.430 --> 01:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:08.390 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:20:08.390 --> 01:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:20:09.830 --> 01:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
anything else
 
01:20:11.590 --> 01:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry that we've had you jumping up
 
01:20:12.790 --> 01:20:12.800 align:start position:0%
and down i
 
01:20:14.870 --> 01:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
appreciate it
 
01:20:16.709 --> 01:20:16.719 align:start position:0%
representative murray
 
01:20:18.709 --> 01:20:18.719 align:start position:0%
thank you uh just a comment although i
 
01:20:20.310 --> 01:20:20.320 align:start position:0%
appreciate my buddy's
 
01:20:22.550 --> 01:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
considerations here i like to think of
 
01:20:25.189 --> 01:20:25.199 align:start position:0%
this as an economic driver for the north
 
01:20:26.870 --> 01:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
country it's and i don't like to think
 
01:20:29.110 --> 01:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
of it just as a project pertaining to
 
01:20:31.590 --> 01:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
the balsams but that it's a project that
 
01:20:33.110 --> 01:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
will benefit all the north country and
 
01:20:34.629 --> 01:20:34.639 align:start position:0%
it seems to me an appropriate thing that
 
01:20:36.229 --> 01:20:36.239 align:start position:0%
we should be able to do to support the
 
01:20:37.510 --> 01:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
north country
 
01:20:39.110 --> 01:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
and that we're not on the hook for
 
01:20:41.030 --> 01:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
anything unless all these benchmarks are
 
01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:44.390 align:start position:0%
anything unless all these benchmarks are
met

01:20:44.390 --> 01:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:47.510 --> 01:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
represent lynn i have to say if
 
01:20:49.510 --> 01:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
if i looked at this purely from an
 
01:20:51.590 --> 01:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
economic perspective it's hard to argue
 
01:20:54.229 --> 01:20:54.239 align:start position:0%
with representative turcotte's uh uh
 
01:20:56.070 --> 01:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
perspective on this uh
 
01:20:57.669 --> 01:20:57.679 align:start position:0%
and i'm probably talking more from my
 
01:20:59.590 --> 01:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
heart than my head but i do tend to
 
01:21:01.189 --> 01:21:01.199 align:start position:0%
agree with representative murray that
 
01:21:02.790 --> 01:21:02.800 align:start position:0%
this is an economic
 
01:21:04.470 --> 01:21:04.480 align:start position:0%
development for the for the north
 
01:21:08.070 --> 01:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
country in some sense and i think
 
01:21:10.229 --> 01:21:10.239 align:start position:0%
you know hopefully this goes off i as i
 
01:21:12.070 --> 01:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
said i've heard some
 
01:21:13.669 --> 01:21:13.679 align:start position:0%
people express
 
01:21:15.350 --> 01:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
doubts about whether it actually will
 
01:21:17.110 --> 01:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
ever get off the ground further than it
 
01:21:18.470 --> 01:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
has but
 
01:21:20.550 --> 01:21:20.560 align:start position:0%
i you know the north country needs this
 
01:21:23.030 --> 01:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
development and and i'm hoping it will
 
01:21:25.510 --> 01:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
and to the extent this this can help it
 
01:21:27.430 --> 01:21:27.440 align:start position:0%
and and i think there are sufficient
 
01:21:29.750 --> 01:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
safeguards in in place so i'm going to
 
01:21:33.270 --> 01:21:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:35.590 --> 01:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
okay question how many people on the
 
01:21:39.110 --> 01:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:44.470 --> 01:21:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:44.480 --> 01:21:45.669 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:21:45.669 --> 01:21:45.679 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:21:45.679 --> 01:21:46.629 align:start position:0%
okay
so

01:21:46.629 --> 01:21:46.639 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:21:50.790 --> 01:21:50.800 align:start position:0%
we want an invitation to play golf
 
01:21:53.510 --> 01:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
on this on
 
01:21:53.520 --> 01:22:06.070 align:start position:0%
on this on
assistant

01:22:06.070 --> 01:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:13.270 --> 01:22:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:15.230 --> 01:22:15.240 align:start position:0%
yeah yes it's all recorded
 
01:22:15.240 --> 01:22:18.790 align:start position:0%
yeah yes it's all recorded
[Laughter]

01:22:18.790 --> 01:22:18.800 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:22:20.709 --> 01:22:20.719 align:start position:0%
that's why i made the comment
 
01:22:25.510 --> 01:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
but anyhow okay so um
 
01:22:27.350 --> 01:22:27.360 align:start position:0%
could i have is there any other
 
01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:28.709 align:start position:0%
could i have is there any other
discussion

01:22:28.709 --> 01:22:28.719 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
01:22:28.719 --> 01:22:29.590 align:start position:0%
discussion
okay

01:22:29.590 --> 01:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:22:31.510 --> 01:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
could i please have a motion
 
01:22:33.990 --> 01:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
representative i'm sorry can i just make
 
01:22:36.070 --> 01:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
one comment just to make sure that the
 
01:22:37.270 --> 01:22:37.280 align:start position:0%
amendment does what the committee is
 
01:22:38.470 --> 01:22:38.480 align:start position:0%
looking to do here
 
01:22:40.790 --> 01:22:40.800 align:start position:0%
so on the uh of the appropriation on
 
01:22:43.990 --> 01:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
roman four on line 23 of this amendment
 
01:22:45.910 --> 01:22:45.920 align:start position:0%
i think the intent here is to cap this
 
01:22:48.390 --> 01:22:48.400 align:start position:0%
at 4.1 million dollars of total costs
 
01:22:50.550 --> 01:22:50.560 align:start position:0%
with it being an open warrant so not
 
01:22:53.270 --> 01:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
necessarily appropriating 4.1 million
 
01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:55.030 align:start position:0%
necessarily appropriating 4.1 million
dollars

01:22:55.030 --> 01:22:55.040 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:22:57.189 --> 01:22:57.199 align:start position:0%
in any given year right
 
01:22:59.350 --> 01:22:59.360 align:start position:0%
the only thing i just point out is
 
01:23:01.110 --> 01:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
it does explicitly say construction
 
01:23:03.590 --> 01:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
costs shall not exceed 4.1 million but
 
01:23:05.110 --> 01:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
the open warrant seems to be for
 
01:23:07.030 --> 01:23:07.040 align:start position:0%
construction costs and other project
 
01:23:07.040 --> 01:23:08.149 align:start position:0%
construction costs and other project
expenses

01:23:08.149 --> 01:23:08.159 align:start position:0%
expenses
 
01:23:10.709 --> 01:23:10.719 align:start position:0%
so i think you'd want to just reconcile
 
01:23:12.709 --> 01:23:12.719 align:start position:0%
those that terminology in that section
 
01:23:15.430 --> 01:23:15.440 align:start position:0%
just so it's clear that it is a cap of
 
01:23:17.830 --> 01:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
total costs at 4.1 million
 
01:23:19.830 --> 01:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
okay so we need an amendment yeah i
 
01:23:21.590 --> 01:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
think so which we're doing one anyways
 
01:23:23.189 --> 01:23:23.199 align:start position:0%
for for all this so i'm just thinking
 
01:23:25.750 --> 01:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
that's a pretty uh um a clerical thing i
 
01:23:28.629 --> 01:23:28.639 align:start position:0%
can just clean up here okay
 
01:23:31.350 --> 01:23:31.360 align:start position:0%
so what i would suggest is on line 23
 
01:23:33.270 --> 01:23:33.280 align:start position:0%
have a say construction costs and other
 
01:23:35.590 --> 01:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
project expenses shall not exceed 4.1
 
01:23:37.510 --> 01:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
million just
 
01:23:37.520 --> 01:23:38.950 align:start position:0%
million just
okay

01:23:38.950 --> 01:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:40.390 align:start position:0%
okay
i

01:23:40.390 --> 01:23:40.400 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:23:41.990 --> 01:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
i agree
 
01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:46.070 align:start position:0%
i agree
okay

01:23:46.070 --> 01:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:47.510 --> 01:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
so we'll
 
01:23:50.629 --> 01:23:50.639 align:start position:0%
deal with this on tomorrow
 
01:23:52.550 --> 01:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
there was nothing else i needed on this
 
01:23:57.430 --> 01:23:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:59.510 --> 01:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
no because we're getting a new amendment
 
01:24:01.990 --> 01:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
you can do a committee vote on this and
 
01:24:03.910 --> 01:24:03.920 align:start position:0%
even take a vote on me stringing the
 
01:24:05.830 --> 01:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
three separate amendments together and
 
01:24:07.590 --> 01:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
then i can provide it similar to how i
 
01:24:09.350 --> 01:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
did with senate bill 420 yesterday if
 
01:24:11.030 --> 01:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
that works for the committee
 
01:24:14.629 --> 01:24:14.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:16.709 --> 01:24:16.719 align:start position:0%
so does somebody want
 
01:24:18.629 --> 01:24:18.639 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:24:21.830 --> 01:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
and seconded by representing heath
 
01:24:24.550 --> 01:24:24.560 align:start position:0%
okay well let's do the amendment first
 
01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:26.390 align:start position:0%
okay well let's do the amendment first
okay

01:24:26.390 --> 01:24:26.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:24:28.070 --> 01:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
yeah okay
 
01:24:31.990 --> 01:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
all those in favor of amendment two zero
 
01:24:33.270 --> 01:24:33.280 align:start position:0%
two two
 
01:24:35.830 --> 01:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
one seven zero three
 
01:24:38.470 --> 01:24:38.480 align:start position:0%
with changes to
 
01:24:38.480 --> 01:24:39.910 align:start position:0%
with changes to
line

01:24:39.910 --> 01:24:39.920 align:start position:0%
line
 
01:24:43.030 --> 01:24:43.040 align:start position:0%
twenty five is that correct mickey line
 
01:24:45.350 --> 01:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
23 i think we'd add construction costs
 
01:24:46.950 --> 01:24:46.960 align:start position:0%
and other project costs right
 
01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:47.750 align:start position:0%
and other project costs right
there

01:24:47.750 --> 01:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:24:51.430 --> 01:24:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:51.440 --> 01:24:53.110 align:start position:0%
 
yep

01:24:53.110 --> 01:24:53.120 align:start position:0%
yep
 
01:24:56.229 --> 01:24:56.239 align:start position:0%
along those lines mickey um
 
01:24:58.550 --> 01:24:58.560 align:start position:0%
construction costs and other project
 
01:25:00.070 --> 01:25:00.080 align:start position:0%
expenses that
 
01:25:03.750 --> 01:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
seems a little overly broad um could you
 
01:25:05.510 --> 01:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
tighten that up to so it actually
 
01:25:08.870 --> 01:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
applies to the road and not
 
01:25:11.910 --> 01:25:11.920 align:start position:0%
other potential projects associated with
 
01:25:13.750 --> 01:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
i know this
 
01:25:15.110 --> 01:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
says to
 
01:25:17.510 --> 01:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
project number five zero or four zero
 
01:25:19.510 --> 01:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
five one eight but
 
01:25:21.430 --> 01:25:21.440 align:start position:0%
when it says other project expenses
 
01:25:21.440 --> 01:25:23.510 align:start position:0%
when it says other project expenses
that's

01:25:23.510 --> 01:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:25:25.669 --> 01:25:25.679 align:start position:0%
we can make it we can say for the
 
01:25:27.830 --> 01:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
project referred in this section we can
 
01:25:29.350 --> 01:25:29.360 align:start position:0%
come up just so it's clear that it's
 
01:25:31.910 --> 01:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
about it's confined to this project yeah
 
01:25:33.830 --> 01:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
i assume there'd be some engineering
 
01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:35.110 align:start position:0%
i assume there'd be some engineering
costs

01:25:35.110 --> 01:25:35.120 align:start position:0%
costs
 
01:25:36.870 --> 01:25:36.880 align:start position:0%
i don't know what else there might be
 
01:25:36.880 --> 01:25:39.030 align:start position:0%
i don't know what else there might be
but

01:25:39.030 --> 01:25:39.040 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:25:44.790 --> 01:25:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:47.510 --> 01:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
okay six one
 
01:25:49.430 --> 01:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:25:53.110 --> 01:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
and now i'll take the uh
 
01:25:54.550 --> 01:25:54.560 align:start position:0%
what do we want to call it mickey's
 
01:25:55.990 --> 01:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
stringing together
 
01:25:58.229 --> 01:25:58.239 align:start position:0%
sure and uh just because i want to
 
01:25:59.830 --> 01:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
complicate things a little bit more for
 
01:26:03.110 --> 01:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
you on 1756 that we adopted earlier the
 
01:26:05.270 --> 01:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
36 million the proposal the department
 
01:26:06.709 --> 01:26:06.719 align:start position:0%
walked us through
 
01:26:08.709 --> 01:26:08.719 align:start position:0%
i just want to add a couple words in
 
01:26:10.470 --> 01:26:10.480 align:start position:0%
there to make it clear that the half
 
01:26:12.790 --> 01:26:12.800 align:start position:0%
that would go and be allocated based on
 
01:26:15.750 --> 01:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
a municipality's uh population that that
 
01:26:17.750 --> 01:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
is for municipalities with a municipal
 
01:26:20.310 --> 01:26:20.320 align:start position:0%
bridge just so it's clear that it's
 
01:26:22.149 --> 01:26:22.159 align:start position:0%
targeted for for municipalities that
 
01:26:23.830 --> 01:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
actually do have a municipal loan bridge
 
01:26:27.030 --> 01:26:27.040 align:start position:0%
okay so is there a oh i guess newcastle
 
01:26:28.629 --> 01:26:28.639 align:start position:0%
didn't have any purchase
 
01:26:28.639 --> 01:26:30.470 align:start position:0%
didn't have any purchase
yeah

01:26:30.470 --> 01:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:26:33.669 --> 01:26:33.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:35.350 --> 01:26:35.360 align:start position:0%
okay i just wanted to get that on the
 
01:26:37.189 --> 01:26:37.199 align:start position:0%
record so when you do see the combined
 
01:26:39.350 --> 01:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
amendment that that'll be uh
 
01:26:41.110 --> 01:26:41.120 align:start position:0%
fixed so
 
01:26:43.350 --> 01:26:43.360 align:start position:0%
what we're doing is that we're asking
 
01:26:43.360 --> 01:26:44.550 align:start position:0%
what we're doing is that we're asking
lba

01:26:44.550 --> 01:26:44.560 align:start position:0%
lba
 
01:26:46.550 --> 01:26:46.560 align:start position:0%
to put together
 
01:26:50.950 --> 01:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
an amendment that combines all of these
 
01:26:54.550 --> 01:26:54.560 align:start position:0%
individual amendments into one new
 
01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:56.149 align:start position:0%
individual amendments into one new
amendment

01:26:56.149 --> 01:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:26:56.159 --> 01:26:57.030 align:start position:0%
amendment
yep

01:26:57.030 --> 01:26:57.040 align:start position:0%
yep
 
01:26:57.040 --> 01:26:57.910 align:start position:0%
yep
okay

01:26:57.910 --> 01:26:57.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:26:57.920 --> 01:27:00.709 align:start position:0%
okay
okay

01:27:00.709 --> 01:27:00.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:02.470 --> 01:27:02.480 align:start position:0%
and that's strung along amendment um
 
01:27:04.390 --> 01:27:04.400 align:start position:0%
that's going to replace the entire bill
 
01:27:06.470 --> 01:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
that's correct
 
01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:07.270 align:start position:0%
that's correct
with

01:27:07.270 --> 01:27:07.280 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:27:09.590 --> 01:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
section 4 remaining as it is in the
 
01:27:10.870 --> 01:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
underlying bill because we didn't amend
 
01:27:12.709 --> 01:27:12.719 align:start position:0%
that in any way but i will present it
 
01:27:14.790 --> 01:27:14.800 align:start position:0%
again in the bill so everyone knows what
 
01:27:17.669 --> 01:27:17.679 align:start position:0%
the entire bill does yeah
 
01:27:20.229 --> 01:27:20.239 align:start position:0%
connect so so that when we vote tomorrow
 
01:27:21.669 --> 01:27:21.679 align:start position:0%
on the amendment
 
01:27:24.790 --> 01:27:24.800 align:start position:0%
with we will have voted on the on the
 
01:27:26.790 --> 01:27:26.800 align:start position:0%
the the complete bill
 
01:27:29.430 --> 01:27:29.440 align:start position:0%
check okay all right

all right so um all those in favor of
 
01:27:39.270 --> 01:27:39.280 align:start position:0%
the lba
 
01:27:41.510 --> 01:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
preparing this amendment with
 
01:27:44.390 --> 01:27:44.400 align:start position:0%
all of the sub-amendment amendments
 
01:27:47.830 --> 01:27:47.840 align:start position:0%
please raise your hand
 
01:27:50.709 --> 01:27:50.719 align:start position:0%

deal with roads and bridges
 
01:27:56.639 --> 01:27:57.350 align:start position:0%
deal with roads and bridges
and

01:27:57.350 --> 01:27:57.360 align:start position:0%

body cameras or whatever
no

01:28:04.470 --> 01:28:04.480 align:start position:0%

we will now move to
sb

01:28:12.830 --> 01:28:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:16.790 --> 01:28:16.800 align:start position:0%
uh 442.
 
01:28:26.830 --> 01:28:26.840 align:start position:0%

seem to have here
 
01:28:36.950 --> 01:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
which which one are you going for
 
01:28:40.390 --> 01:28:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:50.229 --> 01:28:50.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:52.470 --> 01:28:52.480 align:start position:0%
somebody want to speak to uh
 
01:28:54.950 --> 01:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
bill 442
 
01:28:57.830 --> 01:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
state police no
 
01:28:57.840 --> 01:28:59.510 align:start position:0%
state police no
anyone

01:28:59.510 --> 01:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
anyone
 
01:29:09.510 --> 01:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:11.750 --> 01:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
good afternoon again cathy mulcahy
 
01:29:13.510 --> 01:29:13.520 align:start position:0%
hampson my privilege to appear for you
 
01:29:14.950 --> 01:29:14.960 align:start position:0%
but on behalf of the department of
 
01:29:17.270 --> 01:29:17.280 align:start position:0%
transportation with me is mr john
 
01:29:19.189 --> 01:29:19.199 align:start position:0%
corcoran who is the administrator for
 
01:29:22.310 --> 01:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
the bureau of turnpikes
 
01:29:24.149 --> 01:29:24.159 align:start position:0%
the turnpike system is maintained and
 
01:29:26.390 --> 01:29:26.400 align:start position:0%
operated with toll revenue so there's a
 
01:29:28.550 --> 01:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
great need to keep the toll collection
 
01:29:29.990 --> 01:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
system fair
 
01:29:32.229 --> 01:29:32.239 align:start position:0%
uniform and credible and that means when
 
01:29:33.990 --> 01:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
someone chooses to use the turnpike
 
01:29:36.790 --> 01:29:36.800 align:start position:0%
system they must pay for the toll or
 
01:29:38.470 --> 01:29:38.480 align:start position:0%
they have to use an alternative
 
01:29:40.310 --> 01:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
toll-free road
 
01:29:43.430 --> 01:29:43.440 align:start position:0%
the purpose of senate bill 442 is to
 
01:29:46.790 --> 01:29:46.800 align:start position:0%
close the loophole for total evaders
 
01:29:47.990 --> 01:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
better toll
 
01:29:49.669 --> 01:29:49.679 align:start position:0%
collection enforcement in dealing with
 
01:29:52.070 --> 01:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
those who choose to use the turnpike
 
01:29:55.030 --> 01:29:55.040 align:start position:0%
without paying the toll
 
01:29:57.510 --> 01:29:57.520 align:start position:0%
has sent us on this road to to ask for
 
01:29:59.990 --> 01:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
two enforcement changes first i'd like
 
01:30:02.790 --> 01:30:02.800 align:start position:0%
to explain how the um ez pass system the
 
01:30:05.030 --> 01:30:05.040 align:start position:0%
toll collection system works so you can
 
01:30:08.470 --> 01:30:08.480 align:start position:0%
understand what we're asking for
 
01:30:09.910 --> 01:30:09.920 align:start position:0%
the toll is supposed to be paid at the
 
01:30:11.750 --> 01:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
time of use whether you use the cash
 
01:30:13.590 --> 01:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
lane or you have an easy pass account
 
01:30:15.430 --> 01:30:15.440 align:start position:0%
with the transponder it's paid at the
 
01:30:16.950 --> 01:30:16.960 align:start position:0%
time of use
 
01:30:19.110 --> 01:30:19.120 align:start position:0%
if you don't pay at the time of use
 
01:30:21.669 --> 01:30:21.679 align:start position:0%
there is an option to go online and pay
 
01:30:23.750 --> 01:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
within seven days you only have to pay
 
01:30:26.390 --> 01:30:26.400 align:start position:0%
the toll there's no fee
 
01:30:28.870 --> 01:30:28.880 align:start position:0%
if you don't pay within the seven days
 
01:30:32.070 --> 01:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
we begin an invoicing process we send a
 
01:30:34.070 --> 01:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
first invoice requesting payment of the
 
01:30:34.080 --> 01:30:35.030 align:start position:0%
first invoice requesting payment of the
toll

01:30:35.030 --> 01:30:35.040 align:start position:0%
toll
 
01:30:37.590 --> 01:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
plus a dollar fee if that's not paid in
 
01:30:40.470 --> 01:30:40.480 align:start position:0%
30 days we send a second invoice asking
 
01:30:42.550 --> 01:30:42.560 align:start position:0%
for payment of the toll plus a dollar
 
01:30:44.149 --> 01:30:44.159 align:start position:0%
fifty fee
 
01:30:46.390 --> 01:30:46.400 align:start position:0%
if that second invoice isn't paid in 30
 
01:30:49.030 --> 01:30:49.040 align:start position:0%
days the matter escalates to a violation
 
01:30:51.030 --> 01:30:51.040 align:start position:0%
and we send a third notice requesting
 
01:30:55.350 --> 01:30:55.360 align:start position:0%
payment of the toll plus a 25 fee
 
01:30:57.590 --> 01:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
so you're getting three notices to to
 
01:30:59.510 --> 01:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
pay this toll if you haven't paid at the
 
01:31:01.510 --> 01:31:01.520 align:start position:0%
time of use or within the first seven
 
01:31:01.520 --> 01:31:04.070 align:start position:0%
time of use or within the first seven
days

01:31:04.070 --> 01:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:06.870 --> 01:31:06.880 align:start position:0%
when someone has ten or more violations
 
01:31:08.310 --> 01:31:08.320 align:start position:0%
that is they've gotten those three
 
01:31:10.629 --> 01:31:10.639 align:start position:0%
notices they know they have a violation
 
01:31:12.390 --> 01:31:12.400 align:start position:0%
and when they have ten or more of those
 
01:31:15.750 --> 01:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
violations they become eligible for dmv
 
01:31:15.760 --> 01:31:16.870 align:start position:0%
violations they become eligible for dmv
hold

01:31:16.870 --> 01:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
hold
 
01:31:18.870 --> 01:31:18.880 align:start position:0%
and that means they can't re-register
 
01:31:20.390 --> 01:31:20.400 align:start position:0%
their vehicle when their birth month
 
01:31:22.390 --> 01:31:22.400 align:start position:0%
rolls around
 
01:31:25.030 --> 01:31:25.040 align:start position:0%
before anything happens to that person
 
01:31:27.430 --> 01:31:27.440 align:start position:0%
when they have 10 or more violations
 
01:31:29.270 --> 01:31:29.280 align:start position:0%
our folks at turnpike's reach out to
 
01:31:31.430 --> 01:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
them say you have a significant number
 
01:31:33.350 --> 01:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
of violations and we'd like to help you
 
01:31:35.189 --> 01:31:35.199 align:start position:0%
clear those up
 
01:31:37.189 --> 01:31:37.199 align:start position:0%
if they're not cleared up
 
01:31:39.350 --> 01:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
we send their plate information to our
 
01:31:40.790 --> 01:31:40.800 align:start position:0%
partners over at the department of
 
01:31:43.750 --> 01:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
safety and department of safety issues a
 
01:31:45.750 --> 01:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
letter another notice
 
01:31:48.229 --> 01:31:48.239 align:start position:0%
and it says you have 30 days to clear up
 
01:31:50.790 --> 01:31:50.800 align:start position:0%
your violations or you're in dmb hold
 
01:31:53.189 --> 01:31:53.199 align:start position:0%
and you can't re-register your vehicle
 
01:31:57.350 --> 01:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:02.229 --> 01:32:02.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:04.870 --> 01:32:04.880 align:start position:0%
a lot of people um are willing to clear
 
01:32:07.510 --> 01:32:07.520 align:start position:0%
that up um before they get to dmv hold
 
01:32:09.430 --> 01:32:09.440 align:start position:0%
some get nervous when they get the dmv
 
01:32:11.830 --> 01:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
letter um but some people are in dmv
 
01:32:14.229 --> 01:32:14.239 align:start position:0%
hold and they're waiting for their birth
 
01:32:16.390 --> 01:32:16.400 align:start position:0%
month to roll around and then they find
 
01:32:19.669 --> 01:32:19.679 align:start position:0%
out they can't register their vehicle
 
01:32:22.790 --> 01:32:22.800 align:start position:0%
um the reason we're seeking
 
01:32:22.800 --> 01:32:24.950 align:start position:0%
um the reason we're seeking
um

01:32:24.950 --> 01:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:27.430 --> 01:32:27.440 align:start position:0%
the two changes the first change would
 
01:32:29.910 --> 01:32:29.920 align:start position:0%
be that instead of um
 
01:32:32.470 --> 01:32:32.480 align:start position:0%
denial of re-registration privileges in
 
01:32:33.910 --> 01:32:33.920 align:start position:0%
their birth month
 
01:32:35.910 --> 01:32:35.920 align:start position:0%
the suspension of their registration
 
01:32:38.870 --> 01:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
privilege would happen 30-day the 31st
 
01:32:41.510 --> 01:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
day after they received the dmv notice
 
01:32:43.990 --> 01:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
i have people who continue to violate
 
01:32:46.390 --> 01:32:46.400 align:start position:0%
for 11 months after they're in dmv hold
 
01:32:48.070 --> 01:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
and then they call up and they complain
 
01:32:51.189 --> 01:32:51.199 align:start position:0%
why'd you let my total get so high
 
01:32:53.030 --> 01:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
we don't have a magnet to take their car
 
01:32:54.470 --> 01:32:54.480 align:start position:0%
off the road and move them we can't
 
01:32:57.110 --> 01:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
prevent them from from not using the
 
01:32:57.120 --> 01:32:58.870 align:start position:0%
prevent them from from not using the
road

01:32:58.870 --> 01:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
road
 
01:32:58.880 --> 01:33:00.149 align:start position:0%
road
if

01:33:00.149 --> 01:33:00.159 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:33:02.390 --> 01:33:02.400 align:start position:0%
their registration is suspended on day
 
01:33:02.400 --> 01:33:03.750 align:start position:0%
their registration is suspended on day
31

01:33:03.750 --> 01:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
31
 
01:33:05.910 --> 01:33:05.920 align:start position:0%
that's an effective tool to keep them
 
01:33:07.750 --> 01:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
off the road because that's an expensive
 
01:33:09.669 --> 01:33:09.679 align:start position:0%
proposition to keep driving your car
 
01:33:12.229 --> 01:33:12.239 align:start position:0%
when you're under suspension
 
01:33:15.669 --> 01:33:15.679 align:start position:0%
the second change we're asking for
 
01:33:17.350 --> 01:33:17.360 align:start position:0%
is because
 
01:33:20.149 --> 01:33:20.159 align:start position:0%
we have some creative toll evaders in
 
01:33:22.149 --> 01:33:22.159 align:start position:0%
the past they have when they go to
 
01:33:24.229 --> 01:33:24.239 align:start position:0%
register their car and they can't they
 
01:33:26.470 --> 01:33:26.480 align:start position:0%
would get a new plate and circumvent the
 
01:33:28.470 --> 01:33:28.480 align:start position:0%
dmv whole process so we closed that
 
01:33:28.480 --> 01:33:29.750 align:start position:0%
dmv whole process so we closed that
loophole

01:33:29.750 --> 01:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
loophole
 
01:33:31.590 --> 01:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
now what's been happening is they
 
01:33:34.070 --> 01:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
transfer ownership of the vehicle so the
 
01:33:36.390 --> 01:33:36.400 align:start position:0%
husband goes in to register his car he
 
01:33:36.400 --> 01:33:37.510 align:start position:0%
husband goes in to register his car he
can't

01:33:37.510 --> 01:33:37.520 align:start position:0%
can't
 
01:33:39.510 --> 01:33:39.520 align:start position:0%
because he's in dmv hold so he transfers
 
01:33:42.310 --> 01:33:42.320 align:start position:0%
the vehicle to his wife or an adult son
 
01:33:44.629 --> 01:33:44.639 align:start position:0%
so we're in this the second part of this
 
01:33:47.430 --> 01:33:47.440 align:start position:0%
bill we're asking that um someone in dmv
 
01:33:50.390 --> 01:33:50.400 align:start position:0%
hold is prohibited from transferring
 
01:33:51.669 --> 01:33:51.679 align:start position:0%
their vehicle
 
01:33:54.229 --> 01:33:54.239 align:start position:0%
to a family member or someone else who
 
01:33:56.070 --> 01:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
lives at the same address with them
 
01:33:57.510 --> 01:33:57.520 align:start position:0%
which is likely going to be a
 
01:33:59.910 --> 01:33:59.920 align:start position:0%
significant other or
 
01:34:02.950 --> 01:34:02.960 align:start position:0%
relative or close friend
 
01:34:05.189 --> 01:34:05.199 align:start position:0%
so in summary we're asking for these two
 
01:34:07.270 --> 01:34:07.280 align:start position:0%
changes for more effective toll
 
01:34:10.310 --> 01:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
collection the suspension of
 
01:34:12.790 --> 01:34:12.800 align:start position:0%
registration privileges and the
 
01:34:15.110 --> 01:34:15.120 align:start position:0%
prohibited prohibition on transfer of
 
01:34:18.629 --> 01:34:18.639 align:start position:0%
the vehicle when they're in dmv hold
 
01:34:20.310 --> 01:34:20.320 align:start position:0%
and we'd be happy to take any questions
 
01:34:24.629 --> 01:34:24.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:26.470 --> 01:34:26.480 align:start position:0%
and thank you mr channel
 
01:34:28.709 --> 01:34:28.719 align:start position:0%
kathy thank you um
 
01:34:28.719 --> 01:34:30.070 align:start position:0%
kathy thank you um
so

01:34:30.070 --> 01:34:30.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:34:32.390 --> 01:34:32.400 align:start position:0%
the dmv hold we already
 
01:34:35.189 --> 01:34:35.199 align:start position:0%
you already have the authority to to
 
01:34:37.189 --> 01:34:37.199 align:start position:0%
suspend the registration you're just
 
01:34:39.110 --> 01:34:39.120 align:start position:0%
trying to move the dates up we moved the
 
01:34:41.510 --> 01:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
data up right and so it
 
01:34:44.070 --> 01:34:44.080 align:start position:0%
it happens sooner okay and then they're
 
01:34:46.709 --> 01:34:46.719 align:start position:0%
not continuing to incur more violations
 
01:34:48.870 --> 01:34:48.880 align:start position:0%
for the next you know nine months or 11
 
01:34:50.390 --> 01:34:50.400 align:start position:0%
months however long it is until their
 
01:34:52.470 --> 01:34:52.480 align:start position:0%
birth month occurs oh thank you when i
 
01:34:54.070 --> 01:34:54.080 align:start position:0%
first looked at it it looked like it was
 
01:34:56.149 --> 01:34:56.159 align:start position:0%
a new authority
 
01:34:58.070 --> 01:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
it's it's similar authority but it's
 
01:35:00.390 --> 01:35:00.400 align:start position:0%
more imminent it happens sooner
 
01:35:02.950 --> 01:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:04.550 --> 01:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:35:06.470 --> 01:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
and thank you take my question how do
 
01:35:08.870 --> 01:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
you catch them when you
 
01:35:12.149 --> 01:35:12.159 align:start position:0%
negate their registration
 
01:35:13.350 --> 01:35:13.360 align:start position:0%
if their
 
01:35:16.870 --> 01:35:16.880 align:start position:0%
registration privileges are um suspended
 
01:35:18.709 --> 01:35:18.719 align:start position:0%
then it would be a police officer or
 
01:35:20.790 --> 01:35:20.800 align:start position:0%
state police that when they're driving
 
01:35:22.629 --> 01:35:22.639 align:start position:0%
um they might get stopped for tail light
 
01:35:24.709 --> 01:35:24.719 align:start position:0%
or another violation or the police
 
01:35:26.229 --> 01:35:26.239 align:start position:0%
officer might run the plate for some
 
01:35:27.510 --> 01:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
reason and they find out the
 
01:35:36.870 --> 01:35:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:40.229 --> 01:35:40.239 align:start position:0%
you know just a question i i
 
01:35:41.669 --> 01:35:41.679 align:start position:0%
i see
 
01:35:45.270 --> 01:35:45.280 align:start position:0%
i understand that the prohibition on um
 
01:35:46.870 --> 01:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
transferring the registration to someone
 
01:35:49.350 --> 01:35:49.360 align:start position:0%
with the same address but this also says
 
01:35:52.229 --> 01:35:52.239 align:start position:0%
to a family member and how will you
 
01:35:53.750 --> 01:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
how will you know if it's a family
 
01:35:55.590 --> 01:35:55.600 align:start position:0%
member if you know first
 
01:35:57.350 --> 01:35:57.360 align:start position:0%
the person has a different last name for
 
01:35:59.350 --> 01:35:59.360 align:start position:0%
example we won't know so it's not a
 
01:36:01.830 --> 01:36:01.840 align:start position:0%
catch-all but it is an improvement um
 
01:36:03.510 --> 01:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
you know if a husband's transferring to
 
01:36:06.070 --> 01:36:06.080 align:start position:0%
wife they can stop that um and if
 
01:36:07.350 --> 01:36:07.360 align:start position:0%
they're if it's somebody with a
 
01:36:09.350 --> 01:36:09.360 align:start position:0%
different last name but at the same
 
01:36:11.430 --> 01:36:11.440 align:start position:0%
address they can stop that
 
01:36:12.390 --> 01:36:12.400 align:start position:0%
if it's
 
01:36:13.669 --> 01:36:13.679 align:start position:0%
you know we're not going to catch
 
01:36:15.669 --> 01:36:15.679 align:start position:0%
everybody but this does limit it sure
 
01:36:21.910 --> 01:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:22.790 --> 01:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:36:24.149 --> 01:36:24.159 align:start position:0%
i just want to put this out there i
 
01:36:27.669 --> 01:36:27.679 align:start position:0%
think i know how i guess two things um
 
01:36:28.950 --> 01:36:28.960 align:start position:0%
i worry
 
01:36:30.870 --> 01:36:30.880 align:start position:0%
and i'm not very worried about it
 
01:36:32.149 --> 01:36:32.159 align:start position:0%
but i do have to say i'm a little bit
 
01:36:33.669 --> 01:36:33.679 align:start position:0%
worried about people who lose their
 
01:36:36.790 --> 01:36:36.800 align:start position:0%
ability to get to work um and it can be
 
01:36:38.390 --> 01:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
for a variety of reasons
 
01:36:41.510 --> 01:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
um most of them probably not very good
 
01:36:44.229 --> 01:36:44.239 align:start position:0%
but is there a way of negotiating with
 
01:36:46.550 --> 01:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
you uh when they're in kind of this fix
 
01:36:48.310 --> 01:36:48.320 align:start position:0%
and i totally agree they should not be
 
01:36:51.109 --> 01:36:51.119 align:start position:0%
so far down the road here as it were
 
01:36:52.629 --> 01:36:52.639 align:start position:0%
that they get into this much trouble but
 
01:36:54.470 --> 01:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
can you just speak to that and the other
 
01:36:56.470 --> 01:36:56.480 align:start position:0%
question i had um
 
01:36:58.149 --> 01:36:58.159 align:start position:0%
you said you have a if you go through
 
01:37:00.870 --> 01:37:00.880 align:start position:0%
the toll and you're you didn't pay that
 
01:37:00.880 --> 01:37:01.990 align:start position:0%
the toll and you're you didn't pay that
there's

01:37:01.990 --> 01:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
there's
 
01:37:03.910 --> 01:37:03.920 align:start position:0%
you have seven days in which you can go
 
01:37:06.070 --> 01:37:06.080 align:start position:0%
online to do that
 
01:37:08.070 --> 01:37:08.080 align:start position:0%
my legislative orange thing often just
 
01:37:09.910 --> 01:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
never worked and so it you know alarms
 
01:37:11.990 --> 01:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
are going off i never
 
01:37:14.629 --> 01:37:14.639 align:start position:0%
knew what to do about that so how would
 
01:37:15.910 --> 01:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
someone know
 
01:37:17.990 --> 01:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
that they can go online and figure out
 
01:37:20.390 --> 01:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
how to pay so there are signs that the
 
01:37:22.470 --> 01:37:22.480 align:start position:0%
toll facilities that instruct you don't
 
01:37:25.830 --> 01:37:25.840 align:start position:0%
have easy pass and it gives you you know
 
01:37:28.950 --> 01:37:28.960 align:start position:0%
the address to go online to to pay
 
01:37:31.669 --> 01:37:31.679 align:start position:0%
as a legislator you should not have to
 
01:37:33.430 --> 01:37:33.440 align:start position:0%
go online to pay and we should get you a
 
01:37:35.270 --> 01:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
new transponder that works properly no
 
01:37:36.550 --> 01:37:36.560 align:start position:0%
it was fine and they told me i had to
 
01:37:38.310 --> 01:37:38.320 align:start position:0%
put it in a better place and it did not
 
01:37:39.510 --> 01:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
bother me but i'm thinking i'm probably
 
01:37:41.669 --> 01:37:41.679 align:start position:0%
not the only one who would who would do
 
01:37:44.149 --> 01:37:44.159 align:start position:0%
that but it was you know it just set off
 
01:37:46.870 --> 01:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
in alarms and i was embarrassed
 
01:37:48.629 --> 01:37:48.639 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:37:50.709 --> 01:37:50.719 align:start position:0%
to your first question um we work with
 
01:37:53.430 --> 01:37:53.440 align:start position:0%
people all the time to um resolve the
 
01:37:56.229 --> 01:37:56.239 align:start position:0%
fees um they incur a lot of fees if
 
01:37:57.510 --> 01:37:57.520 align:start position:0%
they've been driving you know two or
 
01:37:59.669 --> 01:37:59.679 align:start position:0%
three years without paying their tolls
 
01:38:01.510 --> 01:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
they incur quite a lot of fees and
 
01:38:03.189 --> 01:38:03.199 align:start position:0%
obviously you're not going to be able to
 
01:38:05.430 --> 01:38:05.440 align:start position:0%
collect that at 25 and
 
01:38:07.350 --> 01:38:07.360 align:start position:0%
john has a whole team over at turnpikes
 
01:38:09.270 --> 01:38:09.280 align:start position:0%
that that work with these people to
 
01:38:09.280 --> 01:38:12.470 align:start position:0%
that that work with these people to
resolve

01:38:12.470 --> 01:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:14.550 --> 01:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
yeah how much money do you lose every
 
01:38:17.830 --> 01:38:17.840 align:start position:0%
year to non-payers or evaders
 
01:38:19.030 --> 01:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
do you figure
 
01:38:21.990 --> 01:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
so and that's a collection cost too yeah
 
01:38:24.310 --> 01:38:24.320 align:start position:0%
um our collection costs are all paid for
 
01:38:25.510 --> 01:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
and we come out
 
01:38:27.270 --> 01:38:27.280 align:start position:0%
ahead of the collection costs so we're
 
01:38:28.950 --> 01:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
not in the hole at all for collection
 
01:38:32.310 --> 01:38:32.320 align:start position:0%
costs but we're hoping that these more
 
01:38:35.430 --> 01:38:35.440 align:start position:0%
imminent steps will cut down on some of
 
01:38:37.189 --> 01:38:37.199 align:start position:0%
the steps in collection and will be able
 
01:38:40.070 --> 01:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
to collect sooner which adds to revenue
 
01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:40.950 align:start position:0%
to collect sooner which adds to revenue
and

01:38:40.950 --> 01:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:38:43.109 --> 01:38:43.119 align:start position:0%
takes away some collection costs because
 
01:38:44.950 --> 01:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
of time of our people
 
01:38:47.270 --> 01:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
do you have a number that uh
 
01:38:48.950 --> 01:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
what what you lose in
 
01:38:48.960 --> 01:38:50.790 align:start position:0%
what what you lose in
evaders

01:38:50.790 --> 01:38:50.800 align:start position:0%
evaders
 
01:38:52.310 --> 01:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
number of
 
01:38:54.470 --> 01:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
money money wise
 
01:38:56.950 --> 01:38:56.960 align:start position:0%
no we we as cassie mentioned
 
01:38:59.109 --> 01:38:59.119 align:start position:0%
all our staff and all our work that we
 
01:39:01.590 --> 01:39:01.600 align:start position:0%
do and the money we collect we're we
 
01:39:03.669 --> 01:39:03.679 align:start position:0%
break even more above
 
01:39:05.189 --> 01:39:05.199 align:start position:0%
so we don't lose any money sure you
 
01:39:07.990 --> 01:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
don't lose any money
 
01:39:09.510 --> 01:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
if i could
 
01:39:12.390 --> 01:39:12.400 align:start position:0%
although you don't lose money the state
 
01:39:14.149 --> 01:39:14.159 align:start position:0%
loses money
 
01:39:17.430 --> 01:39:17.440 align:start position:0%
because you're not collecting the tolls
 
01:39:18.709 --> 01:39:18.719 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
01:39:20.629 --> 01:39:20.639 align:start position:0%
if i mean if people are evading the
 
01:39:20.639 --> 01:39:21.910 align:start position:0%
if i mean if people are evading the
tolls

01:39:21.910 --> 01:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
tolls
 
01:39:24.790 --> 01:39:24.800 align:start position:0%
and you have twenty thousand dollars
 
01:39:27.109 --> 01:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
that's evaded that's twenty thousand
 
01:39:28.709 --> 01:39:28.719 align:start position:0%
dollars less
 
01:39:30.709 --> 01:39:30.719 align:start position:0%
that comes into
 
01:39:32.070 --> 01:39:32.080 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:39:34.629 --> 01:39:34.639 align:start position:0%
correct but i think we always stay ahead
 
01:39:36.629 --> 01:39:36.639 align:start position:0%
of that collecting the tolls and the
 
01:39:38.310 --> 01:39:38.320 align:start position:0%
fees so we
 
01:39:40.870 --> 01:39:40.880 align:start position:0%
we're not losing money could we not be
 
01:39:42.950 --> 01:39:42.960 align:start position:0%
spending as much on collection yes and
 
01:39:44.629 --> 01:39:44.639 align:start position:0%
that's what we're hoping to do with with
 
01:39:46.870 --> 01:39:46.880 align:start position:0%
these steps
 
01:39:48.790 --> 01:39:48.800 align:start position:0%
we always collect all the talks yeah
 
01:39:51.350 --> 01:39:51.360 align:start position:0%
make sure well you do if they pay if
 
01:39:53.750 --> 01:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
they pay yes if they don't pay
 
01:39:55.430 --> 01:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
then you don't collect them
 
01:39:57.750 --> 01:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
in the fees that we collect off the you
 
01:39:59.669 --> 01:39:59.679 align:start position:0%
know the whole process
 
01:40:02.229 --> 01:40:02.239 align:start position:0%
we're still above yeah i got that so
 
01:40:06.830 --> 01:40:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:10.229 --> 01:40:10.239 align:start position:0%
you one more question you in the bill
 
01:40:12.149 --> 01:40:12.159 align:start position:0%
that there's a set uh you've set out a
 
01:40:14.870 --> 01:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
schedule of fines um
 
01:40:14.880 --> 01:40:16.550 align:start position:0%
schedule of fines um
uh

01:40:16.550 --> 01:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:40:18.950 --> 01:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
or or authorized the commissioner i
 
01:40:21.350 --> 01:40:21.360 align:start position:0%
guess to to make to to uh establish or
 
01:40:22.790 --> 01:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
schedule fines and i guess my only
 
01:40:23.830 --> 01:40:23.840 align:start position:0%
question is
 
01:40:26.149 --> 01:40:26.159 align:start position:0%
am i understanding correctly that
 
01:40:29.510 --> 01:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
if a person pays the fines
 
01:40:31.510 --> 01:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
do they then get their registration back
 
01:40:33.270 --> 01:40:33.280 align:start position:0%
or is there another fee that they have
 
01:40:36.870 --> 01:40:36.880 align:start position:0%
to pay to get the registration back so
 
01:40:38.470 --> 01:40:38.480 align:start position:0%
that's a good question and there's
 
01:40:40.629 --> 01:40:40.639 align:start position:0%
sometimes confusion on this
 
01:40:43.669 --> 01:40:43.679 align:start position:0%
this the statute that's being amended is
 
01:40:46.149 --> 01:40:46.159 align:start position:0%
actually a department of safety statute
 
01:40:47.990 --> 01:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
not a department of transportation
 
01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:49.189 align:start position:0%
not a department of transportation
statute

01:40:49.189 --> 01:40:49.199 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:40:51.750 --> 01:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
so um because department of safety our
 
01:40:54.229 --> 01:40:54.239 align:start position:0%
partners over there implement the dmv
 
01:40:56.390 --> 01:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
bowl they're in charge of registration
 
01:40:59.270 --> 01:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
and licenses and so they implement
 
01:41:01.270 --> 01:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
we send the plate information over and
 
01:41:01.280 --> 01:41:02.390 align:start position:0%
we send the plate information over and
they

01:41:02.390 --> 01:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:41:04.950 --> 01:41:04.960 align:start position:0%
they implement the whole when it talks
 
01:41:09.189 --> 01:41:09.199 align:start position:0%
about the director um in in um on line
 
01:41:09.199 --> 01:41:10.390 align:start position:0%
about the director um in in um on line
24

01:41:10.390 --> 01:41:10.400 align:start position:0%
24
 
01:41:13.830 --> 01:41:13.840 align:start position:0%
it's referring to the director of dmv
 
01:41:16.070 --> 01:41:16.080 align:start position:0%
and dmv has
 
01:41:19.189 --> 01:41:19.199 align:start position:0%
fees that they impose to
 
01:41:19.199 --> 01:41:20.709 align:start position:0%
fees that they impose to
reinstate

01:41:20.709 --> 01:41:20.719 align:start position:0%
reinstate
 
01:41:23.189 --> 01:41:23.199 align:start position:0%
your registration privileges
 
01:41:25.830 --> 01:41:25.840 align:start position:0%
um and i know from working with them we
 
01:41:25.840 --> 01:41:26.550 align:start position:0%
um and i know from working with them we
the

01:41:26.550 --> 01:41:26.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:41:28.310 --> 01:41:28.320 align:start position:0%
violators have to pay the tolls and the
 
01:41:30.470 --> 01:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
fees whatever they work out with us
 
01:41:32.709 --> 01:41:32.719 align:start position:0%
if they're indeed being hold now they
 
01:41:35.109 --> 01:41:35.119 align:start position:0%
have to go to dmv to to register their
 
01:41:37.270 --> 01:41:37.280 align:start position:0%
vehicle and they have to pay
 
01:41:39.430 --> 01:41:39.440 align:start position:0%
a fee to dmv to reinstate those
 
01:41:43.109 --> 01:41:43.119 align:start position:0%
privileges fee is normally 50
 
01:41:56.390 --> 01:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:00.550 --> 01:42:00.560 align:start position:0%

go through
 
01:45:58.480 --> 01:45:59.750 align:start position:0%

thank you for the opportunity to speak
 
01:46:26.149 --> 01:46:26.159 align:start position:0%
to this uh
 
01:46:29.189 --> 01:46:29.199 align:start position:0%
the hampton beach area commission um
 
01:46:31.750 --> 01:46:31.760 align:start position:0%
originally the bill was to have des do a
 
01:46:31.760 --> 01:46:32.950 align:start position:0%
originally the bill was to have des do a
study

01:46:32.950 --> 01:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
study
 
01:46:35.590 --> 01:46:35.600 align:start position:0%
and we all agreed that it that they're
 
01:46:38.070 --> 01:46:38.080 align:start position:0%
probably not the appropriate entity
 
01:46:40.709 --> 01:46:40.719 align:start position:0%
and so the bill was uh
 
01:46:42.790 --> 01:46:42.800 align:start position:0%
um amended to
 
01:46:42.800 --> 01:46:43.669 align:start position:0%
um amended to
um

01:46:43.669 --> 01:46:43.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:45.510 --> 01:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
go to the hampton beach area commission
 
01:46:47.350 --> 01:46:47.360 align:start position:0%
which is a group of
 
01:46:50.629 --> 01:46:50.639 align:start position:0%
uh folks uh you know the the town and
 
01:46:52.470 --> 01:46:52.480 align:start position:0%
organizations in the community we have a
 
01:46:52.480 --> 01:46:53.430 align:start position:0%
organizations in the community we have a
very

01:46:53.430 --> 01:46:53.440 align:start position:0%
very
 
01:46:56.149 --> 01:46:56.159 align:start position:0%
active um
 
01:46:58.629 --> 01:46:58.639 align:start position:0%
partnership out at hampton
 
01:47:02.149 --> 01:47:02.159 align:start position:0%
and the commission would ensure that
 
01:47:04.390 --> 01:47:04.400 align:start position:0%
that connection to the community is made
 
01:47:06.709 --> 01:47:06.719 align:start position:0%
because obviously any type of investment
 
01:47:08.390 --> 01:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
like this would have an impact on the
 
01:47:09.910 --> 01:47:09.920 align:start position:0%
community with fire
 
01:47:11.350 --> 01:47:11.360 align:start position:0%
and with
 
01:47:11.360 --> 01:47:12.950 align:start position:0%
and with
police

01:47:12.950 --> 01:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
police
 
01:47:14.629 --> 01:47:14.639 align:start position:0%
because of the addition of this
 
01:47:14.639 --> 01:47:16.470 align:start position:0%
because of the addition of this
structure

01:47:16.470 --> 01:47:16.480 align:start position:0%
structure
 
01:47:19.350 --> 01:47:19.360 align:start position:0%
they are authorized in statute
 
01:47:21.669 --> 01:47:21.679 align:start position:0%
to and were very involved of course in
 
01:47:21.679 --> 01:47:22.390 align:start position:0%
to and were very involved of course in
the

01:47:22.390 --> 01:47:22.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:47:24.470 --> 01:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
uh development of the new 14 and a half
 
01:47:25.990 --> 01:47:26.000 align:start position:0%
million dollar facility out there that
 
01:47:27.669 --> 01:47:27.679 align:start position:0%
which which has been extraordinarily
 
01:47:27.679 --> 01:47:29.030 align:start position:0%
which which has been extraordinarily
successful

01:47:29.030 --> 01:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
successful
 
01:47:29.040 --> 01:47:30.310 align:start position:0%
successful
um

01:47:30.310 --> 01:47:30.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:32.070 --> 01:47:32.080 align:start position:0%
so uh we
 
01:47:35.430 --> 01:47:35.440 align:start position:0%
we support them uh working on doing this
 
01:47:37.830 --> 01:47:37.840 align:start position:0%
i'm in been in regular contact with
 
01:47:40.950 --> 01:47:40.960 align:start position:0%
former uh senator stiles who regrets
 
01:47:43.430 --> 01:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
that she can't be here she had to fly
 
01:47:45.030 --> 01:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
out of state to help
 
01:47:47.270 --> 01:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
take care of a friend and was hoping to
 
01:47:50.229 --> 01:47:50.239 align:start position:0%
get back in time um for this but is is
 
01:47:52.550 --> 01:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
on her way back from logan and suggested
 
01:47:54.149 --> 01:47:54.159 align:start position:0%
that if you needed to
 
01:47:56.629 --> 01:47:56.639 align:start position:0%
to um uh she could be available tomorrow
 
01:47:58.310 --> 01:47:58.320 align:start position:0%
if you did want to follow up with her
 
01:47:58.320 --> 01:47:59.109 align:start position:0%
if you did want to follow up with her
but

01:47:59.109 --> 01:47:59.119 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:48:02.070 --> 01:48:02.080 align:start position:0%
um we're uh we're
 
01:48:04.470 --> 01:48:04.480 align:start position:0%
um very supportive of the
 
01:48:06.790 --> 01:48:06.800 align:start position:0%
uh amount of funding because we imagine
 
01:48:07.910 --> 01:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
this will be a
 
01:48:10.310 --> 01:48:10.320 align:start position:0%
a reasonably substantial investment that
 
01:48:12.310 --> 01:48:12.320 align:start position:0%
requires thorough study
 
01:48:15.189 --> 01:48:15.199 align:start position:0%
uh because of course the weather and um
 
01:48:16.709 --> 01:48:16.719 align:start position:0%
the ocean is
 
01:48:19.590 --> 01:48:19.600 align:start position:0%
is a uh uh it can be quite a quite a
 
01:48:21.750 --> 01:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
force out there as we know firsthand
 
01:48:24.229 --> 01:48:24.239 align:start position:0%
from our experience but we also
 
01:48:25.910 --> 01:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
agree that a
 
01:48:27.830 --> 01:48:27.840 align:start position:0%
a peer uh
 
01:48:29.990 --> 01:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
would be a um
 
01:48:32.870 --> 01:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
a wonderful attraction to the uh to the
 
01:48:34.950 --> 01:48:34.960 align:start position:0%
seacoast and it's something that is not
 
01:48:37.109 --> 01:48:37.119 align:start position:0%
currently there that you do have
 
01:48:39.750 --> 01:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
other uh if it is possible to construct
 
01:48:42.790 --> 01:48:42.800 align:start position:0%
uh you have in other other parts
 
01:48:45.350 --> 01:48:45.360 align:start position:0%
of the eastern seaboard yeah i i don't
 
01:48:47.430 --> 01:48:47.440 align:start position:0%
think any of us have any problem with
 
01:48:47.440 --> 01:48:49.109 align:start position:0%
think any of us have any problem with
what

01:48:49.109 --> 01:48:49.119 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:48:51.430 --> 01:48:51.440 align:start position:0%
what what we're trying to accomplish we
 
01:48:56.149 --> 01:48:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:56.159 --> 01:48:57.030 align:start position:0%
 
flow

01:48:57.030 --> 01:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
flow
 
01:48:57.040 --> 01:48:59.109 align:start position:0%
flow
through

01:48:59.109 --> 01:48:59.119 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:49:01.510 --> 01:49:01.520 align:start position:0%
uh department of uh natural and cultural
 
01:49:04.149 --> 01:49:04.159 align:start position:0%
resources or cultural natural resources
 
01:49:04.159 --> 01:49:05.510 align:start position:0%
resources or cultural natural resources
so

01:49:05.510 --> 01:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:49:05.520 --> 01:49:06.790 align:start position:0%
so
yeah

01:49:06.790 --> 01:49:06.800 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:49:06.800 --> 01:49:17.109 align:start position:0%
yeah
um

01:49:17.109 --> 01:49:17.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:19.830 --> 01:49:19.840 align:start position:0%
could we then do you know if we could
 
01:49:22.950 --> 01:49:22.960 align:start position:0%
then allow the
 
01:49:22.960 --> 01:49:26.550 align:start position:0%
then allow the
um

01:49:26.550 --> 01:49:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:29.669 --> 01:49:29.679 align:start position:0%
you know part of it was we are really
 
01:49:32.629 --> 01:49:32.639 align:start position:0%
flat out straight working on the
 
01:49:35.270 --> 01:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
arpa funding that you all gave us
 
01:49:38.390 --> 01:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
and this was a way of uh turning a
 
01:49:40.310 --> 01:49:40.320 align:start position:0%
project over to
 
01:49:43.030 --> 01:49:43.040 align:start position:0%
another entity to follow up on
 
01:49:44.950 --> 01:49:44.960 align:start position:0%
um we're really kind of actually
 
01:49:47.910 --> 01:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
stressed um quite a bit with trying to
 
01:49:50.790 --> 01:49:50.800 align:start position:0%
to get that money uh contracted and and
 
01:49:50.800 --> 01:49:51.830 align:start position:0%
to get that money uh contracted and and
spent

01:49:51.830 --> 01:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
spent
 
01:49:54.709 --> 01:49:54.719 align:start position:0%
and i know um certainly uh former
 
01:49:57.270 --> 01:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
senator stiles and john nyan also with
 
01:49:59.669 --> 01:49:59.679 align:start position:0%
the chamber are committed to getting out
 
01:50:00.950 --> 01:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
there and hire
 
01:50:02.950 --> 01:50:02.960 align:start position:0%
uh hire somebody
 
01:50:05.189 --> 01:50:05.199 align:start position:0%
uh and get something going so they can
 
01:50:07.910 --> 01:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
put their you know their their feet on
 
01:50:09.830 --> 01:50:09.840 align:start position:0%
the ground to get this done so we were
 
01:50:09.840 --> 01:50:10.709 align:start position:0%
the ground to get this done so we were
very

01:50:10.709 --> 01:50:10.719 align:start position:0%
very
 
01:50:13.109 --> 01:50:13.119 align:start position:0%
supportive of the commission
 
01:50:14.950 --> 01:50:14.960 align:start position:0%
go ahead and doing this they do have
 
01:50:17.430 --> 01:50:17.440 align:start position:0%
they do exist in statute we are on the
 
01:50:18.629 --> 01:50:18.639 align:start position:0%
we are on
 
01:50:20.070 --> 01:50:20.080 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:50:20.080 --> 01:50:21.430 align:start position:0%
the um
uh

01:50:21.430 --> 01:50:21.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:50:23.430 --> 01:50:23.440 align:start position:0%
we are on the commission
 
01:50:24.790 --> 01:50:24.800 align:start position:0%
and we
 
01:50:26.070 --> 01:50:26.080 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:50:28.149 --> 01:50:28.159 align:start position:0%
worked with uh former senator styles
 
01:50:31.189 --> 01:50:31.199 align:start position:0%
many years and very trust trusting that
 
01:50:33.669 --> 01:50:33.679 align:start position:0%
she is going to be able to pull this off
 
01:50:35.589 --> 01:50:35.599 align:start position:0%
i'm a little concerned whether or not we
 
01:50:37.510 --> 01:50:37.520 align:start position:0%
would be able to get it done in the time
 
01:50:39.270 --> 01:50:39.280 align:start position:0%
frame i don't i don't think this is
 
01:50:41.669 --> 01:50:41.679 align:start position:0%
requiring you to do anything other than
 
01:50:41.679 --> 01:50:42.950 align:start position:0%
requiring you to do anything other than
to

01:50:42.950 --> 01:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:50:45.350 --> 01:50:45.360 align:start position:0%
accept the money and give it to the
 
01:50:48.870 --> 01:50:48.880 align:start position:0%
hampton beach commission
 
01:50:51.589 --> 01:50:51.599 align:start position:0%
that i mean that's right mickey that's
 
01:50:54.390 --> 01:50:54.400 align:start position:0%
all there's no work required of you
 
01:50:55.430 --> 01:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
it's all
 
01:50:55.440 --> 01:50:56.229 align:start position:0%
it's all
just

01:50:56.229 --> 01:50:56.239 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:50:58.950 --> 01:50:58.960 align:start position:0%
it's just the matter of the money going
 
01:51:01.030 --> 01:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
through a state agency
 
01:51:03.669 --> 01:51:03.679 align:start position:0%
as opposed to directly to directly to
 
01:51:05.109 --> 01:51:05.119 align:start position:0%
the commission correct
 
01:51:08.070 --> 01:51:08.080 align:start position:0%
and is that are we all square that that
 
01:51:08.080 --> 01:51:09.589 align:start position:0%
and is that are we all square that that
is

01:51:09.589 --> 01:51:09.599 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:51:11.669 --> 01:51:11.679 align:start position:0%
going to work in the in the
 
01:51:13.189 --> 01:51:13.199 align:start position:0%
business process
 
01:51:13.199 --> 01:51:17.510 align:start position:0%
business process
no

01:51:17.510 --> 01:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:20.149 --> 01:51:20.159 align:start position:0%
can i ask there would be there would be
 
01:51:22.709 --> 01:51:22.719 align:start position:0%
no reason to have to come back to the
 
01:51:25.350 --> 01:51:25.360 align:start position:0%
gnc they've this is just a feasibility
 
01:51:27.189 --> 01:51:27.199 align:start position:0%
study that we're giving them the
 
01:51:28.709 --> 01:51:28.719 align:start position:0%
authority to do
 
01:51:30.870 --> 01:51:30.880 align:start position:0%
we're giving them the money so that
 
01:51:33.830 --> 01:51:33.840 align:start position:0%
hampton because we're not taking out
 
01:51:36.950 --> 01:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
anything that's in the first paragraph
 
01:51:43.669 --> 01:51:43.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:46.229 --> 01:51:46.239 align:start position:0%
yes it's a straight pass-through of the
 
01:51:48.310 --> 01:51:48.320 align:start position:0%
entire amount the natural cultural
 
01:51:50.470 --> 01:51:50.480 align:start position:0%
resources won't take an administrative
 
01:51:51.990 --> 01:51:52.000 align:start position:0%
fee from it so it's a they'll get the
 
01:51:57.270 --> 01:51:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:59.870 --> 01:51:59.880 align:start position:0%
it's it's general fund dollars correct
 
01:52:03.510 --> 01:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
yes okay you know can i can i just ask
 
01:52:05.589 --> 01:52:05.599 align:start position:0%
really a question of the chair i i
 
01:52:07.350 --> 01:52:07.360 align:start position:0%
i have no problem with with it i guess
 
01:52:08.709 --> 01:52:08.719 align:start position:0%
i'm just not quite
 
01:52:10.470 --> 01:52:10.480 align:start position:0%
it sort of seems like
 
01:52:12.550 --> 01:52:12.560 align:start position:0%
we're saying
 
01:52:14.310 --> 01:52:14.320 align:start position:0%
and we're going to write two checks in
 
01:52:16.229 --> 01:52:16.239 align:start position:0%
other words so the legislature's going
 
01:52:18.310 --> 01:52:18.320 align:start position:0%
to write a check so to speak to to the
 
01:52:20.229 --> 01:52:20.239 align:start position:0%
to the state agency and the state agency
 
01:52:22.149 --> 01:52:22.159 align:start position:0%
is going to write a check to the town
 
01:52:23.830 --> 01:52:23.840 align:start position:0%
what's why is it easier to just write a
 
01:52:26.310 --> 01:52:26.320 align:start position:0%
check to the town it's because the state
 
01:52:26.320 --> 01:52:27.589 align:start position:0%
check to the town it's because the state
doesn't

01:52:27.589 --> 01:52:27.599 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
01:52:30.709 --> 01:52:30.719 align:start position:0%
we would if we put in legislation that
 
01:52:32.470 --> 01:52:32.480 align:start position:0%
representative lin would get a hundred
 
01:52:34.629 --> 01:52:34.639 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
01:52:34.639 --> 01:52:35.510 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
okay

01:52:35.510 --> 01:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:52:39.830 --> 01:52:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:43.510 --> 01:52:43.520 align:start position:0%
body some state agency
 
01:52:44.390 --> 01:52:44.400 align:start position:0%
i search
 
01:52:45.830 --> 01:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
somebody does if somebody has to write
 
01:52:47.669 --> 01:52:47.679 align:start position:0%
the check and we're not we're not going
 
01:52:50.950 --> 01:52:50.960 align:start position:0%
to write it ourselves i got it right
 
01:52:53.270 --> 01:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
so if i may just uh clarify so it is
 
01:52:55.750 --> 01:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
unusual um that we would appropriate
 
01:52:57.669 --> 01:52:57.679 align:start position:0%
money to a non-state
 
01:52:59.589 --> 01:52:59.599 align:start position:0%
entity so that when the bill came to us
 
01:53:01.189 --> 01:53:01.199 align:start position:0%
the direct appropriation was to the
 
01:53:03.830 --> 01:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
hampton beach area commission so we just
 
01:53:06.550 --> 01:53:06.560 align:start position:0%
selected the most uh logical agency to
 
01:53:08.470 --> 01:53:08.480 align:start position:0%
just have the funds flow through so in
 
01:53:09.990 --> 01:53:10.000 align:start position:0%
the appropriation statement you would
 
01:53:12.070 --> 01:53:12.080 align:start position:0%
see an appropriation for cultural and
 
01:53:14.149 --> 01:53:14.159 align:start position:0%
natural resources for this purpose to
 
01:53:22.950 --> 01:53:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:24.390 --> 01:53:24.400 align:start position:0%
i don't think so i didn't hear the
 
01:53:26.709 --> 01:53:26.719 align:start position:0%
question i'm sorry
 
01:53:28.709 --> 01:53:28.719 align:start position:0%
no so section one of this bill is
 
01:53:30.310 --> 01:53:30.320 align:start position:0%
unchanged by this amendment that still
 
01:53:31.830 --> 01:53:31.840 align:start position:0%
requires the hampton beach area
 
01:53:33.830 --> 01:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
commission to conduct the the
 
01:53:35.430 --> 01:53:35.440 align:start position:0%
feasibility study there's no
 
01:53:37.109 --> 01:53:37.119 align:start position:0%
responsibility here for the department
 
01:53:45.189 --> 01:53:45.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:45.199 --> 01:53:46.870 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:53:46.870 --> 01:53:46.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:53:49.830 --> 01:53:49.840 align:start position:0%
um yes if if that is the appropriate way
 
01:53:52.790 --> 01:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
to disperse these funds then um and then
 
01:53:54.390 --> 01:53:54.400 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll uh
 
01:53:56.390 --> 01:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
we'll confirm if there's any other
 
01:53:58.310 --> 01:53:58.320 align:start position:0%
process but hopefully not the money can
 
01:53:59.830 --> 01:53:59.840 align:start position:0%
just be
 
01:54:01.750 --> 01:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
sent to the agency and then forward it
 
01:54:04.390 --> 01:54:04.400 align:start position:0%
along to the commission
 
01:54:04.400 --> 01:54:05.510 align:start position:0%
along to the commission
right

01:54:05.510 --> 01:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:54:05.520 --> 01:54:06.790 align:start position:0%
right
okay

01:54:06.790 --> 01:54:06.800 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:54:10.390 --> 01:54:10.400 align:start position:0%

01:54:52.390 --> 01:54:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:54.870 --> 01:54:54.880 align:start position:0%

oh okay
so

01:54:57.750 --> 01:54:57.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:54:59.270 --> 01:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
sorry to
 
01:55:00.709 --> 01:55:00.719 align:start position:0%
i'm fixing i'm trying to fix a lot of
 
01:55:02.310 --> 01:55:02.320 align:start position:0%
things right now one that just jumped
 
01:55:04.550 --> 01:55:04.560 align:start position:0%
out at me at this moment so
 
01:55:07.109 --> 01:55:07.119 align:start position:0%
the content of the amendment is is fine
 
01:55:09.030 --> 01:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
if you look at the bill title the way it
 
01:55:11.030 --> 01:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
came over from the senate it says
 
01:55:12.229 --> 01:55:12.239 align:start position:0%
requiring the department of
 
01:55:13.910 --> 01:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
environmental services to conduct a
 
01:55:16.310 --> 01:55:16.320 align:start position:0%
feasibility study that was the title of
 
01:55:18.790 --> 01:55:18.800 align:start position:0%
this bill as introduced the senate
 
01:55:21.910 --> 01:55:21.920 align:start position:0%
amended it to take des out of it however
 
01:55:23.510 --> 01:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
when that amendment was drafted to do
 
01:55:25.430 --> 01:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
that they never amended the bill title
 
01:55:26.950 --> 01:55:26.960 align:start position:0%
and this amendment that i just gave you
 
01:55:30.070 --> 01:55:30.080 align:start position:0%
here that we are good with also doesn't
 
01:55:31.030 --> 01:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
so i
 
01:55:32.229 --> 01:55:32.239 align:start position:0%
feel like we should probably clean up
 
01:55:34.310 --> 01:55:34.320 align:start position:0%
the bill title so i can draft you i
 
01:55:35.750 --> 01:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
think you can carry out your work and i
 
01:55:37.430 --> 01:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
can have an amendment and i'll send it
 
01:55:39.510 --> 01:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
to you tonight that is this exact
 
01:55:43.030 --> 01:55:43.040 align:start position:0%
content just with a fixed bill title
 
01:55:44.709 --> 01:55:44.719 align:start position:0%
i think you can just know that the
 
01:55:46.790 --> 01:55:46.800 align:start position:0%
number is going to change but it's
 
01:55:48.390 --> 01:55:48.400 align:start position:0%
yes the title and the number will change
 
01:55:49.910 --> 01:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
but the the content of the amendment
 
01:55:51.589 --> 01:55:51.599 align:start position:0%
will be unchanged you know did i have
 
01:55:52.870 --> 01:55:52.880 align:start position:0%
that correct it was moved by
 
01:55:54.070 --> 01:55:54.080 align:start position:0%
representative murray and seconded by
 
01:55:57.910 --> 01:55:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:00.390 --> 01:56:00.400 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry you trio doesn't matter all
 
01:56:00.400 --> 01:56:03.510 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry you trio doesn't matter all
right

01:56:03.510 --> 01:56:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:05.350 --> 01:56:05.360 align:start position:0%

01:58:28.390 --> 01:58:28.400 align:start position:0%

01:58:49.430 --> 01:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
i know but we have to have our
 
01:58:49.440 --> 01:58:50.390 align:start position:0%
i know but we have to have our
we

01:58:50.390 --> 01:58:50.400 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:58:51.990 --> 01:58:52.000 align:start position:0%
we have to have all our stuff done
 
01:58:55.350 --> 01:58:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:12.149 --> 01:59:12.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:15.430 --> 01:59:15.440 align:start position:0%
well let's see that's one two three four
 
01:59:15.440 --> 01:59:16.390 align:start position:0%
well let's see that's one two three four
five

01:59:16.390 --> 01:59:16.400 align:start position:0%
five
 
01:59:20.390 --> 01:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:20.400 --> 01:59:21.669 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:59:21.669 --> 01:59:21.679 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:59:23.030 --> 01:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
for ten so you're gonna do it at ten
 
01:59:24.310 --> 01:59:24.320 align:start position:0%
yeah because
 
01:59:26.709 --> 01:59:26.719 align:start position:0%
because we've got that one
 
01:59:29.350 --> 01:59:29.360 align:start position:0%
we've got um
 
01:59:34.550 --> 01:59:34.560 align:start position:0%
396 right that we have 394 394. we could
 
01:59:36.310 --> 01:59:36.320 align:start position:0%
do that we could do that now i believe
 
01:59:38.550 --> 01:59:38.560 align:start position:0%
we recess to now with that one and i
 
01:59:40.390 --> 01:59:40.400 align:start position:0%
have the amendment that i emailed last
 
01:59:41.669 --> 01:59:41.679 align:start position:0%
night so you could
 
01:59:43.109 --> 01:59:43.119 align:start position:0%
close that one out
 
01:59:46.790 --> 01:59:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:46.800 --> 02:00:03.830 align:start position:0%
 
it's

02:00:03.830 --> 02:00:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:26.229 --> 02:00:26.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:27.669 --> 02:00:27.679 align:start position:0%
so this amendment
 
02:00:29.990 --> 02:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
from our conversation yesterday on line
 
02:00:32.310 --> 02:00:32.320 align:start position:0%
10 you'll see we added to clarify that
 
02:00:35.750 --> 02:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
it's until their 22nd birthday
 
02:00:38.950 --> 02:00:38.960 align:start position:0%
on line 16 we deleted the last sentence
 
02:00:41.270 --> 02:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
relative to
 
02:00:43.910 --> 02:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
the reference to rsa 171-a i believe it
 
02:00:45.510 --> 02:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
was the developmental disability
 
02:00:45.520 --> 02:00:47.109 align:start position:0%
was the developmental disability
services

02:00:47.109 --> 02:00:47.119 align:start position:0%
services
 
02:00:49.589 --> 02:00:49.599 align:start position:0%
and then down in the second paragraph
 
02:00:51.270 --> 02:00:51.280 align:start position:0%
i added some
 
02:00:53.589 --> 02:00:53.599 align:start position:0%
language that would take
 
02:00:54.950 --> 02:00:54.960 align:start position:0%
that would allow for the department to
 
02:00:56.629 --> 02:00:56.639 align:start position:0%
draw a warrant if the funds that we've
 
02:01:23.030 --> 02:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:23.040 --> 02:01:24.790 align:start position:0%
 
sure

02:01:24.790 --> 02:01:24.800 align:start position:0%
sure
 
02:01:26.229 --> 02:01:26.239 align:start position:0%
it's still um
 
02:01:28.709 --> 02:01:28.719 align:start position:0%
now we eliminated the section about the
 
02:01:31.189 --> 02:01:31.199 align:start position:0%
adult services and the reason we did
 
02:01:35.750 --> 02:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:38.070 --> 02:01:38.080 align:start position:0%
remember there was a section about um
 
02:01:40.709 --> 02:01:40.719 align:start position:0%
this action should negate
 
02:01:44.790 --> 02:01:44.800 align:start position:0%
the ability to access the adult services
 
02:01:52.070 --> 02:01:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:55.510 --> 02:01:55.520 align:start position:0%
no we had we had struck that
 
02:01:58.149 --> 02:01:58.159 align:start position:0%
right but i'm just asking why
 
02:02:00.149 --> 02:02:00.159 align:start position:0%
i i think there was concern about the
 
02:02:01.589 --> 02:02:01.599 align:start position:0%
amendment the first draft of the
 
02:02:04.149 --> 02:02:04.159 align:start position:0%
amendment spoke to that the provisions
 
02:02:06.390 --> 02:02:06.400 align:start position:0%
of such services uh
 
02:02:08.310 --> 02:02:08.320 align:start position:0%
does not obviate adult developmental
 
02:02:10.149 --> 02:02:10.159 align:start position:0%
disability service for which a student
 
02:02:11.430 --> 02:02:11.440 align:start position:0%
over 21
 
02:02:13.430 --> 02:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
may qualify i think there was a concern
 
02:02:15.830 --> 02:02:15.840 align:start position:0%
of how it said may qualify
 
02:02:15.840 --> 02:02:16.950 align:start position:0%
of how it said may qualify
um

02:02:16.950 --> 02:02:16.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:19.109 --> 02:02:19.119 align:start position:0%
i'd have to that was the discussion from
 
02:02:20.550 --> 02:02:20.560 align:start position:0%
yesterday to remember the specifics but
 
02:02:22.709 --> 02:02:22.719 align:start position:0%
i remember that attorney's alan
 
02:02:22.719 --> 02:02:23.510 align:start position:0%
i remember that attorney's alan
and

02:02:23.510 --> 02:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:02:25.589 --> 02:02:25.599 align:start position:0%
i the lady's name escapes me now this
 
02:02:27.669 --> 02:02:27.679 align:start position:0%
was their preference on this
 
02:02:29.830 --> 02:02:29.840 align:start position:0%
rosenberger i think wasn't it
 
02:02:31.030 --> 02:02:31.040 align:start position:0%
no it was uh
 
02:02:33.270 --> 02:02:33.280 align:start position:0%
attorney's ellen because my concern is
 
02:02:36.310 --> 02:02:36.320 align:start position:0%
that in representative in senator khan's
 
02:02:39.189 --> 02:02:39.199 align:start position:0%
amendment he wanted to make sure that
 
02:02:40.550 --> 02:02:40.560 align:start position:0%
this action
 
02:02:40.560 --> 02:02:41.750 align:start position:0%
this action
didn't

02:02:41.750 --> 02:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
didn't
 
02:02:41.760 --> 02:02:44.470 align:start position:0%
didn't
negate

02:02:44.470 --> 02:02:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:44.480 --> 02:02:45.270 align:start position:0%
 
the

02:02:45.270 --> 02:02:45.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:02:47.589 --> 02:02:47.599 align:start position:0%
capacity of the adult
 
02:02:51.189 --> 02:02:51.199 align:start position:0%
service agency to get the services
 
02:02:53.189 --> 02:02:53.199 align:start position:0%
and she talked to the two
 
02:02:55.830 --> 02:02:55.840 align:start position:0%
they kind of should abut each other but
 
02:02:55.840 --> 02:02:57.109 align:start position:0%
they kind of should abut each other but
that

02:02:57.109 --> 02:02:57.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:02:59.109 --> 02:02:59.119 align:start position:0%
the reason we took it out
 
02:03:02.070 --> 02:03:02.080 align:start position:0%
is because that is the normal process it
 
02:03:04.070 --> 02:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
is okay and that's what it should be and
 
02:03:05.910 --> 02:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
that's what it should be so we should we
 
02:03:08.550 --> 02:03:08.560 align:start position:0%
don't address it right okay and and if
 
02:03:10.709 --> 02:03:10.719 align:start position:0%
you recall they had a handwritten some
 
02:03:12.470 --> 02:03:12.480 align:start position:0%
language that they said if you kept that
 
02:03:14.629 --> 02:03:14.639 align:start position:0%
in consider this but if you take that
 
02:03:16.790 --> 02:03:16.800 align:start position:0%
out we don't need this so that's that's
 
02:03:16.800 --> 02:03:28.310 align:start position:0%
out we don't need this so that's that's
yeah

02:03:28.310 --> 02:03:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:28.320 --> 02:03:30.709 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:03:30.709 --> 02:03:30.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:32.390 --> 02:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
the amendment that we're
 
02:03:34.950 --> 02:03:34.960 align:start position:0%
considering is one seven seven zero
 
02:03:36.390 --> 02:03:36.400 align:start position:0%
that's correct
 
02:03:38.310 --> 02:03:38.320 align:start position:0%
so there was another one here
 
02:03:40.390 --> 02:03:40.400 align:start position:0%
um did we do anything with this one
 
02:03:43.430 --> 02:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
seven three one it's gone it's it's gone
 
02:03:47.910 --> 02:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:51.189 --> 02:03:51.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:00.310 --> 02:04:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:05.109 --> 02:04:05.119 align:start position:0%
714 is gone too 731 replaced 714 and now
 
02:04:08.629 --> 02:04:08.639 align:start position:0%
770 is replacing 731.
 
02:04:08.639 --> 02:04:11.030 align:start position:0%
770 is replacing 731.
so

02:04:11.030 --> 02:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:12.550 --> 02:04:12.560 align:start position:0%
i guess i want to
 
02:04:14.229 --> 02:04:14.239 align:start position:0%
i just want to make sure
 
02:04:14.239 --> 02:04:15.990 align:start position:0%
i just want to make sure
sure

02:04:15.990 --> 02:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
sure
 
02:04:17.750 --> 02:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
my understanding of what we did
 
02:04:19.189 --> 02:04:19.199 align:start position:0%
yesterday is a little bit different and
 
02:04:20.629 --> 02:04:20.639 align:start position:0%
i just want to make sure that nobody
 
02:04:22.229 --> 02:04:22.239 align:start position:0%
that that
 
02:04:23.510 --> 02:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
nobody's sort of voting under a
 
02:04:26.390 --> 02:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
misapprehension i thought that what
 
02:04:29.030 --> 02:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
mr zelen and i thought her name was
 
02:04:29.040 --> 02:04:32.310 align:start position:0%
mr zelen and i thought her name was
rosenberg

02:04:32.310 --> 02:04:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:34.229 --> 02:04:34.239 align:start position:0%
no no rosenberg from the disabilities
 
02:04:34.239 --> 02:04:36.069 align:start position:0%
no no rosenberg from the disabilities
rights

02:04:36.069 --> 02:04:36.079 align:start position:0%
rights
 
02:04:38.709 --> 02:04:38.719 align:start position:0%
yeah just i thought that they both said
 
02:04:40.470 --> 02:04:40.480 align:start position:0%
at the end
 
02:04:41.910 --> 02:04:41.920 align:start position:0%
that they wanted to take out the
 
02:04:44.709 --> 02:04:44.719 align:start position:0%
language which was taken out because
 
02:04:46.149 --> 02:04:46.159 align:start position:0%
right now
 
02:04:48.310 --> 02:04:48.320 align:start position:0%
there's right now i thought that the
 
02:04:50.390 --> 02:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
department of education
 
02:04:53.270 --> 02:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry dhhs was taking the position
 
02:04:55.030 --> 02:04:55.040 align:start position:0%
that if somebody was getting special
 
02:04:59.830 --> 02:04:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:01.510 --> 02:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
dis demand developmental disability
 
02:05:03.830 --> 02:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
services and the disabilities rights
 
02:05:05.830 --> 02:05:05.840 align:start position:0%
center had a lawsuit in the process
 
02:05:07.750 --> 02:05:07.760 align:start position:0%
going because of that and they were
 
02:05:09.589 --> 02:05:09.599 align:start position:0%
concerned that we should just not say
 
02:05:11.350 --> 02:05:11.360 align:start position:0%
anything in here
 
02:05:13.669 --> 02:05:13.679 align:start position:0%
about that and so
 
02:05:15.270 --> 02:05:15.280 align:start position:0%
that's why i think we took it out so i
 
02:05:16.950 --> 02:05:16.960 align:start position:0%
mean i think that's the extent you were
 
02:05:19.510 --> 02:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
thinking that they will get the services
 
02:05:21.189 --> 02:05:21.199 align:start position:0%
i mean i think right now would only be
 
02:05:23.430 --> 02:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
if the if the court says they should as
 
02:05:34.149 --> 02:05:34.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:36.310 --> 02:05:36.320 align:start position:0%
please turn your mic on
 
02:05:37.990 --> 02:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
um the federal
 
02:05:40.550 --> 02:05:40.560 align:start position:0%
idea legislation requires that
 
02:05:40.560 --> 02:05:41.669 align:start position:0%
idea legislation requires that
transition

02:05:41.669 --> 02:05:41.679 align:start position:0%
transition
 
02:05:44.229 --> 02:05:44.239 align:start position:0%
um and for the services to begin to abut
 
02:05:46.870 --> 02:05:46.880 align:start position:0%
so i i'm thinking that
 
02:05:50.390 --> 02:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
what mickey said was we it already is
 
02:05:52.790 --> 02:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
and so we just need to be silent on it
 
02:05:54.950 --> 02:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
because it is what it's supposed to be
 
02:05:59.030 --> 02:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:00.709 --> 02:06:00.719 align:start position:0%
do anything else to
 
02:06:03.189 --> 02:06:03.199 align:start position:0%
draw our attention to it or
 
02:06:07.830 --> 02:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:10.470 --> 02:06:10.480 align:start position:0%

number one is kind of a
 
02:11:26.629 --> 02:11:26.639 align:start position:0%
general statement by the senate
 
02:11:31.430 --> 02:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:33.750 --> 02:11:33.760 align:start position:0%

i don't need it but i know the senate
 
02:11:45.109 --> 02:11:45.119 align:start position:0%
tends to
 
02:11:47.109 --> 02:11:47.119 align:start position:0%
love that sort of stuff so what do other
 
02:11:53.430 --> 02:11:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:59.430 --> 02:11:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:59.440 --> 02:12:00.310 align:start position:0%
 
you're

02:12:00.310 --> 02:12:00.320 align:start position:0%
you're
 
02:12:03.430 --> 02:12:03.440 align:start position:0%
referring to section one i
 
02:12:10.950 --> 02:12:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:14.629 --> 02:12:14.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:16.390 --> 02:12:16.400 align:start position:0%
let's take it out
 
02:12:19.189 --> 02:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:21.189 --> 02:12:21.199 align:start position:0%
i know that'll be the that'll be the
 
02:12:22.870 --> 02:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
committee of conference
 
02:12:25.109 --> 02:12:25.119 align:start position:0%
that's to why they want the findings in
 
02:12:25.119 --> 02:12:26.550 align:start position:0%
that's to why they want the findings in
there

02:12:26.550 --> 02:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:12:29.510 --> 02:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
okay so um yeah
 
02:12:32.229 --> 02:12:32.239 align:start position:0%
so what this is doing we had a little
 
02:12:34.790 --> 02:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
long discussion about whether it should
 
02:12:37.270 --> 02:12:37.280 align:start position:0%
be a separate board blah blah blah and
 
02:12:41.350 --> 02:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:44.069 --> 02:12:44.079 align:start position:0%
what we did here is
 
02:12:46.790 --> 02:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
we didn't direct them to put it under
 
02:12:49.270 --> 02:12:49.280 align:start position:0%
the law enforcement conduct review
 
02:12:49.280 --> 02:12:50.310 align:start position:0%
the law enforcement conduct review
committee

02:12:50.310 --> 02:12:50.320 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:12:50.320 --> 02:12:53.510 align:start position:0%
committee
but

02:12:53.510 --> 02:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:55.750 --> 02:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
under the auspices
 
02:12:58.310 --> 02:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
and similar to that established
 
02:12:58.320 --> 02:13:00.149 align:start position:0%
and similar to that established
in

02:13:00.149 --> 02:13:00.159 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:13:02.950 --> 02:13:02.960 align:start position:0%
the bill we passed last year about that
 
02:13:05.189 --> 02:13:05.199 align:start position:0%
and it was just so that
 
02:13:07.750 --> 02:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
all of it is in the same place even
 
02:13:10.629 --> 02:13:10.639 align:start position:0%
though it's a different different thing
 
02:13:15.270 --> 02:13:15.280 align:start position:0%
and the other thing that we did
 
02:13:15.280 --> 02:13:17.430 align:start position:0%
and the other thing that we did
was

02:13:17.430 --> 02:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
was
 
02:13:21.589 --> 02:13:21.599 align:start position:0%
we changed the appropriation by

02:13:30.390 --> 02:13:30.400 align:start position:0%
for cit training
 
02:13:32.229 --> 02:13:32.239 align:start position:0%
oh somebody asked me if we were gonna do
 
02:13:33.910 --> 02:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
cit training
 
02:13:37.270 --> 02:13:37.280 align:start position:0%
this afternoon and i said no
 
02:13:44.950 --> 02:13:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:44.960 --> 02:13:45.750 align:start position:0%
 
uh

02:13:45.750 --> 02:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:13:47.350 --> 02:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
it came right off
 
02:13:54.149 --> 02:13:54.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:54.159 --> 02:13:57.030 align:start position:0%
 
uh

02:13:57.030 --> 02:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:00.069 --> 02:14:00.079 align:start position:0%
because of the um
 
02:14:02.550 --> 02:14:02.560 align:start position:0%
the number of police departments that
 
02:14:04.069 --> 02:14:04.079 align:start position:0%
need training
 
02:14:07.510 --> 02:14:07.520 align:start position:0%
not every town has a police department
 
02:14:10.069 --> 02:14:10.079 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:14:14.390 --> 02:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
i think that he said 48 had already been
 
02:14:14.400 --> 02:14:16.550 align:start position:0%
i think that he said 48 had already been
trained

02:14:48.310 --> 02:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
oh this is a person that asked me about
 
02:14:52.629 --> 02:14:52.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:55.830 --> 02:14:55.840 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
02:14:58.149 --> 02:14:58.159 align:start position:0%
so um
 
02:15:00.390 --> 02:15:00.400 align:start position:0%
i knew someone had asked me about it
 
02:15:03.270 --> 02:15:03.280 align:start position:0%
okay so that was why we reduced it by
 
02:15:05.030 --> 02:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
the hundred thousand
 
02:15:05.040 --> 02:15:06.470 align:start position:0%
the hundred thousand
just

02:15:06.470 --> 02:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:15:10.390 --> 02:15:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:14.390 --> 02:15:14.400 align:start position:0%
if it's done through contracting
 
02:15:15.750 --> 02:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
it was like
 
02:15:17.910 --> 02:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
12 000
 
02:15:17.920 --> 02:15:19.990 align:start position:0%
12 000
okay

02:15:19.990 --> 02:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:22.709 align:start position:0%
okay
so

02:15:22.709 --> 02:15:22.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:15:24.550 --> 02:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
did you want to say anything on this are
 
02:15:39.430 --> 02:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:40.950 --> 02:15:40.960 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:15:42.950 --> 02:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
no we definitely support the cit
 
02:15:42.960 --> 02:15:44.470 align:start position:0%
no we definitely support the cit
training

02:15:44.470 --> 02:15:44.480 align:start position:0%
training
 
02:15:44.480 --> 02:15:49.669 align:start position:0%
training
okay

02:15:49.669 --> 02:15:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:51.910 --> 02:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
is there anything
 
02:15:57.990 --> 02:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:01.510 --> 02:16:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:05.430 --> 02:16:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:05.440 --> 02:16:07.350 align:start position:0%
 
section

02:16:07.350 --> 02:16:07.360 align:start position:0%
section
 
02:16:07.360 --> 02:16:09.030 align:start position:0%
section
minus

02:16:09.030 --> 02:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
minus
 
02:16:11.990 --> 02:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
finding is that what it is or yeah if
 
02:16:14.790 --> 02:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
you look at the if you look at the bill
 
02:16:17.510 --> 02:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
section one is findings yeah and this
 
02:16:20.870 --> 02:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:20.880 --> 02:16:25.189 align:start position:0%
 
no

02:16:25.189 --> 02:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:26.629 --> 02:16:26.639 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry
 
02:16:26.639 --> 02:16:29.990 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry

02:16:29.990 --> 02:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:31.270 --> 02:16:31.280 align:start position:0%
am i right
 
02:16:33.110 --> 02:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
this says amends section four of the
 
02:16:35.429 --> 02:16:35.439 align:start position:0%
bill by replacing
 
02:16:37.270 --> 02:16:37.280 align:start position:0%
paragraph one
 
02:16:40.070 --> 02:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
as follows so it's section four
 
02:16:47.669 --> 02:16:47.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:48.870 --> 02:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
do you
 
02:16:50.870 --> 02:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
do you want a new amendment that does
 
02:16:52.469 --> 02:16:52.479 align:start position:0%
strike the findings you can vote on that
 
02:16:54.309 --> 02:16:54.319 align:start position:0%
and i can just draft it
 
02:16:56.230 --> 02:16:56.240 align:start position:0%
okay so keep it
 
02:17:01.110 --> 02:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:03.270 --> 02:17:03.280 align:start position:0%
and then we're
 
02:17:06.549 --> 02:17:06.559 align:start position:0%
deleting subparagraph
 
02:17:06.559 --> 02:17:07.910 align:start position:0%
deleting subparagraph
two

02:17:07.910 --> 02:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
two
 
02:17:07.920 --> 02:17:11.030 align:start position:0%
two
oh

02:17:11.030 --> 02:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:12.230 --> 02:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
and that was
 
02:17:14.309 --> 02:17:14.319 align:start position:0%
because it's a repeat yeah if you look
 
02:17:16.870 --> 02:17:16.880 align:start position:0%
at uh sub paragraph j on line 22 of the
 
02:17:18.469 --> 02:17:18.479 align:start position:0%
bill you'll see that the president of
 
02:17:20.070 --> 02:17:20.080 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire police association was
 
02:17:22.150 --> 02:17:22.160 align:start position:0%
listed twice so he just deleted the
 
02:17:24.070 --> 02:17:24.080 align:start position:0%
second reference
 
02:17:24.080 --> 02:17:25.270 align:start position:0%
second reference
okay

02:17:25.270 --> 02:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:17:34.389 --> 02:17:34.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:34.399 --> 02:17:36.469 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:17:36.469 --> 02:17:36.479 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:17:39.669 --> 02:17:39.679 align:start position:0%
so it's staying in here um under duties
 
02:17:41.830 --> 02:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
roman numeral two the list of all the
 
02:17:45.669 --> 02:17:45.679 align:start position:0%
organizations is is stays
 
02:17:45.679 --> 02:17:47.030 align:start position:0%
organizations is is stays
yup

02:17:47.030 --> 02:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
yup
 
02:17:51.190 --> 02:17:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:53.110 --> 02:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
it says the committee shall celest
 
02:18:00.070 --> 02:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:02.469 --> 02:18:02.479 align:start position:0%
in this case does shall mean every one
 
02:18:03.990 --> 02:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
of them
 
02:18:06.629 --> 02:18:06.639 align:start position:0%
or they shall solicit from the group
 
02:18:06.639 --> 02:18:23.030 align:start position:0%
or they shall solicit from the group
below

02:18:23.030 --> 02:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:24.389 --> 02:18:24.399 align:start position:0%
not that it was off
 
02:18:26.309 --> 02:18:26.319 align:start position:0%
polly stevens i am the director of
 
02:18:29.110 --> 02:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
public policy for nami new hampshire
 
02:18:31.270 --> 02:18:31.280 align:start position:0%
and so what it would do is create a
 
02:18:33.190 --> 02:18:33.200 align:start position:0%
committee which is made up of just
 
02:18:33.200 --> 02:18:35.190 align:start position:0%
committee which is made up of just
legislators

02:18:35.190 --> 02:18:35.200 align:start position:0%
legislators
 
02:18:38.070 --> 02:18:38.080 align:start position:0%
because we figured with a list of folks
 
02:18:41.190 --> 02:18:41.200 align:start position:0%
that long that had a stake in this
 
02:18:42.629 --> 02:18:42.639 align:start position:0%
that a commission would be way too
 
02:18:47.110 --> 02:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
unwieldy so it's a committee
 
02:18:50.870 --> 02:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
but what the legislation sets forth is
 
02:18:53.270 --> 02:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
all of the entities
 
02:18:56.389 --> 02:18:56.399 align:start position:0%
that the committee has to ask to come to
 
02:18:56.399 --> 02:18:57.990 align:start position:0%
that the committee has to ask to come to
testify

02:18:57.990 --> 02:18:58.000 align:start position:0%
testify
 
02:19:00.150 --> 02:19:00.160 align:start position:0%
obviously the committee can say no i
 
02:19:02.150 --> 02:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
mean the organization could say no they
 
02:19:04.389 --> 02:19:04.399 align:start position:0%
don't want to
 
02:19:07.270 --> 02:19:07.280 align:start position:0%
but um and
 
02:19:09.750 --> 02:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
i believe every single
 
02:19:12.230 --> 02:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
organization on that list wanted to be
 
02:19:13.750 --> 02:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
on that list
 
02:19:13.760 --> 02:19:18.830 align:start position:0%
on that list
so

02:19:18.830 --> 02:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:18.840 --> 02:19:20.389 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:19:20.389 --> 02:19:20.399 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:19:22.299 --> 02:19:22.309 align:start position:0%
you don't have to be on the committee
 
02:19:22.309 --> 02:19:24.230 align:start position:0%
you don't have to be on the committee
[Laughter]

02:19:24.230 --> 02:19:24.240 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
02:19:26.150 --> 02:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
i'm sure there'll be a reason for one of
 
02:19:28.950 --> 02:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
us to be on that committee
 
02:19:28.960 --> 02:19:29.990 align:start position:0%
us to be on that committee
okay

02:19:29.990 --> 02:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:19:31.030 --> 02:19:31.040 align:start position:0%

02:19:42.709 --> 02:19:42.719 align:start position:0%
uh representative petrie's second
 
02:19:46.549 --> 02:19:46.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:49.110 --> 02:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
all in favor
 
02:19:49.120 --> 02:19:50.550 align:start position:0%

02:19:58.469 --> 02:19:58.479 align:start position:0%
we didn't lose anybody
 
02:20:03.349 --> 02:20:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:03.359 --> 02:20:05.750 align:start position:0%
 
okay

okay
 
02:20:07.670 --> 02:20:07.680 align:start position:0%
does it matter that the fiscal note
 
02:20:09.670 --> 02:20:09.680 align:start position:0%
still says 1.2 million
 
02:20:11.590 --> 02:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
do we care
 
02:20:13.590 --> 02:20:13.600 align:start position:0%

02:20:15.110 --> 02:20:15.120 align:start position:0%

02:20:17.429 --> 02:20:17.439 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note won't change until
 
02:20:22.389 --> 02:20:22.399 align:start position:0%
