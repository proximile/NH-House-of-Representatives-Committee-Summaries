that is going to be our normal um
 
00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
there's just no other way to do it so I
 
00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 align:start position:0%
understand the com concerns against that
 
00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 align:start position:0%
um we have 75 bills in our possession
 
00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 align:start position:0%
currently there could be more coming
 
00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 align:start position:0%
through vacation not through vacation
 
00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 align:start position:0%
but people vacating bills um
 
00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 align:start position:0%
so just be aware I understand that not
 
00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 align:start position:0%
everybody's going to like when I'm
 
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 align:start position:0%
imposing the time limits and moving
 
00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:06.229 align:start position:0%
imposing the time limits and moving
people

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:03:08.149 --> 00:03:08.159 align:start position:0%
along got to talk to your colleagues
 
00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:11.799 align:start position:0%
about not filing 75 bills um and then we
 
00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:13.599 align:start position:0%
can go back to the way it was but this
 
00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 align:start position:0%
is what it's going to be like so uh
 
00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 align:start position:0%
we're going to have probably some
 
00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 align:start position:0%
Growing Pains today as we move through
 
00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 align:start position:0%
11 bills which is by the way not enough
 
00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 align:start position:0%
um but that's how it's going to be so
 
00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 align:start position:0%
anyways we're going to start it off uh
 
00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 align:start position:0%
going to open up the public hearing for
 
00:03:28.149 --> 00:03:28.159 align:start position:0%
House Bill 107 relative to political
 
00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 align:start position:0%
advertising printed in newspaper
 
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
periodicals or Billboards uh
 
00:03:33.429 --> 00:03:33.439 align:start position:0%

just a cleanup I'll be two minutes
 
00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 align:start position:0%
actually this is to add what was taken
 
00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 align:start position:0%
out of a bill last year um and what it
 
00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
is is that the political adverti printed
 
00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
in newspapers periodicals Billboards
 
00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 align:start position:0%
don't need to be marked at the beginning
 
00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
at the end it really shouldn't be the
 
00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 align:start position:0%
responsibility of outlets to be
 
00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 align:start position:0%
responsible for what um candidates are
 
00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
putting on and this came up uh for those
 
00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 align:start position:0%
of you who were not here last year came
 
00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:10.159 align:start position:0%

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 align:start position:0%
against a small business a small um
 
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 align:start position:0%
paper owner in londondary and um because

for the record my name is Kaye of stadio

I'm a Durham voter and public policy
 
00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
fellow with open democracy we're a
 
00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:16.960 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan nonprofit representing
 
00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
36,000 voters across the state and I'm
 
00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240 align:start position:0%
submitting testimony today in opposition
 
00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:25.280 align:start position:0%
to HB 107 relative to political
 
00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:27.080 align:start position:0%
advertising printed in newspapers
 
00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 align:start position:0%
periodicals and billboards the existing
 
00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:32.120 align:start position:0%
statute RSA
 
00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:34.280 align:start position:0%
6646 which requires political
 
00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
advertisements to be labeled as such in
 
00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:39.560 align:start position:0%
print is rooted in common sense HB 107
 
00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 align:start position:0%
would effectively delete this language
 
00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.240 align:start position:0%
from current election law allowing for
 
00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:45.280 align:start position:0%
the unintentional perpetuation of
 
00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:46.590 align:start position:0%
the unintentional perpetuation of
political

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:46.600 align:start position:0%
political
 
00:05:49.309 --> 00:05:49.319 align:start position:0%
misinformation electoral transparency is
 
00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:51.199 align:start position:0%
an integral component of a healthy
 
00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:53.400 align:start position:0%
democracy and I see no reason to
 
00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:55.560 align:start position:0%
Backside by withholding potentially
 
00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:58.440 align:start position:0%
influential information from voters
 
00:05:59.870 --> 00:05:59.880 align:start position:0%
voters should have the right to to know
 
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
who is buying influence through ads the
 
00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:04.440 align:start position:0%
primary goal of political advertising is
 
00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:06.560 align:start position:0%
not to inform the public in a neutral
 
00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
manner but to gain more votes and
 
00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:10.160 align:start position:0%
naturally this can lead to the
 
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
unfortunate inclusion of hyperbolic
 
00:06:14.589 --> 00:06:14.599 align:start position:0%
language and falsehoods in otherwise
 
00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:16.479 align:start position:0%
well intentioned
 
00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:18.560 align:start position:0%
advertisements and there is no federal
 
00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:20.520 align:start position:0%
or state penalty on the books for lying
 
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:22.560 align:start position:0%
in paid political advertisement as of
 
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
now which is why holding candidates and
 
00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:26.680 align:start position:0%
committees accountable through mandatory
 
00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:29.599 align:start position:0%
disclosure is so important clear PR
 
00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:32.120 align:start position:0%
ident has also been said regarding the
 
00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:34.360 align:start position:0%
matter Miss Deborah Paul as mentioned
 
00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:36.680 align:start position:0%
before publisher of the linary times was
 
00:06:39.189 --> 00:06:39.199 align:start position:0%
found guilty of five misdemeanor charges
 
00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:41.400 align:start position:0%
and fin in 2023 for failing to Mark
 
00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:43.720 align:start position:0%
political advertisements as such despite
 
00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
receiving several warnings in the Years
 
00:06:48.309 --> 00:06:48.319 align:start position:0%
leading up to this the consequences for
 
00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
omitting this crucial information are
 
00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:52.120 align:start position:0%
clear and should not be dismissed on a
 
00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
whim please consider voting HB 107
 
00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate striking this
 
00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
legislation would be detrimental to the
 
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
Integrity of our campaign processes and
 
00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:04.400 align:start position:0%
the already fragile system of media
 
00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:06.560 align:start position:0%
messaging that our society relies so
 
00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:09.800 align:start position:0%
heavily on thank you will you be taking
 
00:07:11.589 --> 00:07:11.599 align:start position:0%
questions uh yes are there questions
 
00:07:12.629 --> 00:07:12.639 align:start position:0%
from the
 
00:07:16.029 --> 00:07:16.039 align:start position:0%
committee okay oh yes representative
 
00:07:18.629 --> 00:07:18.639 align:start position:0%
C thank you for Mr chairman thank you
 
00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:22.160 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh shouldn't it
 
00:07:24.309 --> 00:07:24.319 align:start position:0%
be the hus be on the person buying the
 
00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:26.240 align:start position:0%
ad rather than the
 
00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:29.800 align:start position:0%
publisher um I would say that the media
 
00:07:32.629 --> 00:07:32.639 align:start position:0%
has a duty to just disclose any
 
00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:34.240 align:start position:0%
information that they
 
00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:37.720 align:start position:0%
have yeah further
 
00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:40.440 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you um I
 
00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:42.000 align:start position:0%

of ways I'm here to help clarify the law
 
00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
after an incident that happened in
 
00:23:10.269 --> 00:23:10.279 align:start position:0%
Claremont this past election cycle we
 
00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:13.080 align:start position:0%
had an incident where candidate sinage
 
00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:15.960 align:start position:0%
was placed on the Claremont green one
 
00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:18.240 align:start position:0%
morning members of Black lives matters
 
00:23:20.149 --> 00:23:20.159 align:start position:0%
began to illegally remove signs that
 
00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:22.320 align:start position:0%
were placed on the green and so the
 
00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:24.320 align:start position:0%
incident along with video footage was
 
00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:25.960 align:start position:0%
reported to the New Hampshire Attorney
 
00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
General's office the attorney en's
 
00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:30.760 align:start position:0%
office then wrote a letter to the city
 
00:23:35.789 --> 00:23:35.799 align:start position:0%
manager citing RSA 664 colon 17 saying
 
00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:39.240 align:start position:0%
that and and I I um given you a packet
 
00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:40.600 align:start position:0%
with the letter from the attorney
 
00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
general to Claremont as well as the
 
00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:45.240 align:start position:0%
letter from Claremont back to uh the
 
00:23:48.669 --> 00:23:48.679 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office and so the
 
00:23:50.789 --> 00:23:50.799 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office wrote a letter
 
00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:52.480 align:start position:0%
saying that the political signs are
 
00:23:55.269 --> 00:23:55.279 align:start position:0%
forbidden on public property and that
 
00:23:58.070 --> 00:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
they their office requested that all
 
00:24:00.190 --> 00:24:00.200 align:start position:0%
political signs be removed from public
 
00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:01.669 align:start position:0%
political signs be removed from public
property

00:24:01.669 --> 00:24:01.679 align:start position:0%
property
 
00:24:03.549 --> 00:24:03.559 align:start position:0%
immediately this request was
 
00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
communicated to all candidates and
 
00:24:08.269 --> 00:24:08.279 align:start position:0%
everyone scurried around removing their
 
00:24:12.789 --> 00:24:12.799 align:start position:0%
signage uh to to take every in any place
 
00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:16.120 align:start position:0%
that was a public uh right away uh the
 
00:24:17.669 --> 00:24:17.679 align:start position:0%
candidates were instructed that they had
 
00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:19.640 align:start position:0%
to come and pick up their
 
00:24:22.789 --> 00:24:22.799 align:start position:0%
signs in the meantime the city's
 
00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:25.240 align:start position:0%
manager's attorney the city manager's
 
00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:28.200 align:start position:0%
attorney uh or the city's attorney wrote
 
00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:29.960 align:start position:0%
back back to the New Hampshire attorney
 
00:24:32.149 --> 00:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
general with a different interpretation
 
00:24:34.990 --> 00:24:35.000 align:start position:0%
of the statute plus identifying what
 
00:24:37.470 --> 00:24:37.480 align:start position:0%
they believed was an inconsistency in
 
00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:38.310 align:start position:0%
they believed was an inconsistency in
the

00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:38.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:24:41.669 --> 00:24:41.679 align:start position:0%
statute they wrote uh quote lastly if
 
00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:43.320 align:start position:0%
you consider the overall statutory
 
00:24:45.029 --> 00:24:45.039 align:start position:0%
scheme and language of the entirety of
 
00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:47.080 align:start position:0%
this legislative act you will have to
 
00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:49.000 align:start position:0%
arrive at the same logical conclusion as
 
00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
to the meaning of said statute another
 
00:24:54.149 --> 00:24:54.159 align:start position:0%
sentence in this law sets forth quote no
 
00:24:56.310 --> 00:24:56.320 align:start position:0%
person shall remove deface or knowingly
 
00:24:58.669 --> 00:24:58.679 align:start position:0%
destroy any political advertising which
 
00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:00.600 align:start position:0%
is placed on or a fixed to public
 
00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
property or any private property except
 
00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:05.360 align:start position:0%
for removal by the owner of the property
 
00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:07.640 align:start position:0%
persons authorized by the owner of the
 
00:25:09.549 --> 00:25:09.559 align:start position:0%
property or a law enforcement officer
 
00:25:12.149 --> 00:25:12.159 align:start position:0%
removing improper advertising end quote
 
00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:13.720 align:start position:0%
that's in the
 
00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:16.480 align:start position:0%
law they continued and they said if your
 
00:25:19.909 --> 00:25:19.919 align:start position:0%
interpretation of RSA 664 colon 17 were
 
00:25:22.669 --> 00:25:22.679 align:start position:0%
correct then why would the legislature
 
00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:25.080 align:start position:0%
have to insert language prohibiting
 
00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
removal of said political advertising by
 
00:25:30.549 --> 00:25:30.559 align:start position:0%
non authorized individuals on public
 
00:25:33.389 --> 00:25:33.399 align:start position:0%
property if such initial action the
 
00:25:35.470 --> 00:25:35.480 align:start position:0%
placement of the political advertising
 
00:25:37.909 --> 00:25:37.919 align:start position:0%
was illegal in the first
 
00:25:40.789 --> 00:25:40.799 align:start position:0%
place anyway after their F their back
 
00:25:43.549 --> 00:25:43.559 align:start position:0%
and forth exchange the City of Claremont
 
00:25:46.350 --> 00:25:46.360 align:start position:0%
granted permission for political signage
 
00:25:48.389 --> 00:25:48.399 align:start position:0%
to be able to be placed on their public
 
00:25:51.029 --> 00:25:51.039 align:start position:0%
land and all candidates were informed
 
00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
that they could again put their signs
 
00:25:55.669 --> 00:25:55.679 align:start position:0%
back for that couple of weeks it was a
 
00:25:58.470 --> 00:25:58.480 align:start position:0%
very confusing and crazy time people
 
00:25:59.789 --> 00:25:59.799 align:start position:0%
were wondering whether they could put
 
00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:01.960 align:start position:0%
signs up not put signs up where they can
 
00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:03.200 align:start position:0%
put them where they couldn't put them
 
00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
and so forth and because there seems to
 
00:26:08.389 --> 00:26:08.399 align:start position:0%
be so much confusion over that I brought
 
00:26:10.190 --> 00:26:10.200 align:start position:0%
this bill forward to try and clear up
 
00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
the statute and make it so that local
 
00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
municipalities can grant permission for
 
00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:18.520 align:start position:0%
signage to be placed on public land and
 
00:26:21.389 --> 00:26:21.399 align:start position:0%
publicly owned rights of way and I look
 
00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:23.120 align:start position:0%
forward to your conversation on this
 
00:26:25.470 --> 00:26:25.480 align:start position:0%
issue and would be happy to answer any
 
00:26:27.630 --> 00:26:27.640 align:start position:0%
questions and as I said I've also
 
00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:29.200 align:start position:0%
provided the letters that were written
 
00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:36.440 align:start position:0%
matter um other questions from the
 
00:26:39.149 --> 00:26:39.159 align:start position:0%
committee yes representative Newsome
 
00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:40.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:26:43.789 --> 00:26:43.799 align:start position:0%
taking this question um property rights
 
00:26:45.669 --> 00:26:45.679 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire often go to the center
 
00:26:49.669 --> 00:26:49.679 align:start position:0%
line of the road for the landowner and
 
00:26:52.029 --> 00:26:52.039 align:start position:0%
um the right of way then goes out from
 
00:26:54.389 --> 00:26:54.399 align:start position:0%
that Center so there is an overlapping
 
00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:56.240 align:start position:0%
area where it is in the right of way
 
00:27:00.149 --> 00:27:00.159 align:start position:0%
owned controlled by the town for a road
 
00:27:02.789 --> 00:27:02.799 align:start position:0%
and owned by the property owner with
 
00:27:05.549 --> 00:27:05.559 align:start position:0%
this language saying or by consent could
 
00:27:09.149 --> 00:27:09.159 align:start position:0%
the town give permission to put signs in
 
00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:11.240 align:start position:0%
the right of way which is otherwise
 
00:27:15.269 --> 00:27:15.279 align:start position:0%
private property thank you I would not I
 
00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:18.240 align:start position:0%
don't believe so because uh no it we
 
00:27:20.269 --> 00:27:20.279 align:start position:0%
also say here no political advertising
 
00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
shall be placed on private property
 
00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:23.640 align:start position:0%
without the owner's
 
00:27:26.549 --> 00:27:26.559 align:start position:0%
consent so thank you have both you would
 
00:27:29.389 --> 00:27:29.399 align:start position:0%
need both uh consent from the local
 
00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:31.480 align:start position:0%
municipality as well as a private land
 
00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:35.360 align:start position:0%

00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:37.960 align:start position:0%
overlap I'm sorry a followup yes follow
 
00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:39.440 align:start position:0%

00:27:55.029 --> 00:27:55.039 align:start position:0%
a little unclear on what happened
 
00:27:59.029 --> 00:27:59.039 align:start position:0%
exactly in Claremont that um
 
00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:01.080 align:start position:0%
that made you want to file this
 
00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:02.840 align:start position:0%
legislation was and I know every
 
00:28:04.350 --> 00:28:04.360 align:start position:0%
Community is different with the
 
00:28:05.789 --> 00:28:05.799 align:start position:0%
different Traditions that they have for
 
00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:10.000 align:start position:0%
where people campaigning put signs so
 
00:28:12.389 --> 00:28:12.399 align:start position:0%
was it the case that in Claremont there
 
00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
was a public area like a park or a a
 
00:28:18.149 --> 00:28:18.159 align:start position:0%
their green yeah it was their public
 
00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:21.480 align:start position:0%
Green Town Center the town green
 
00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:24.760 align:start position:0%
and historically people have put signs
 
00:28:26.909 --> 00:28:26.919 align:start position:0%
there corre people from all different
 
00:28:30.430 --> 00:28:30.440 align:start position:0%
political sides signs there and the town
 
00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:34.440 align:start position:0%
allowed it yes and then some some sign
 
00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:37.960 align:start position:0%
was there and BLM opposed it but could
 
00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:39.960 align:start position:0%
they have put their own signs there as
 
00:28:41.950 --> 00:28:41.960 align:start position:0%
well if they wanted to they could have
 
00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
put their own signs up but they were
 
00:28:46.110 --> 00:28:46.120 align:start position:0%
illegally Mo removing you're not
 
00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:48.360 align:start position:0%
supposed to touch anybody else's signage
 
00:28:51.909 --> 00:28:51.919 align:start position:0%
once it's erected wherever it is and um
 
00:28:53.789 --> 00:28:53.799 align:start position:0%
they were REM physically removing the
 
00:28:56.149 --> 00:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
signs there was someone taking video of
 
00:28:58.149 --> 00:28:58.159 align:start position:0%
it and everything and reported that
 
00:29:00.909 --> 00:29:00.919 align:start position:0%
incident to the Attorney General's
 
00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:03.960 align:start position:0%
office in New Hampshire and the Attorney
 
00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:06.720 align:start position:0%
General then wrote back this letter to
 
00:29:08.830 --> 00:29:08.840 align:start position:0%
the City of Claremont saying well you're
 
00:29:10.549 --> 00:29:10.559 align:start position:0%
not supposed to have anything on your
 
00:29:13.149 --> 00:29:13.159 align:start position:0%
public land anyway so we want you to
 
00:29:15.509 --> 00:29:15.519 align:start position:0%
remove them because you're breaking the
 
00:29:18.149 --> 00:29:18.159 align:start position:0%
law and they wrote back and they said
 
00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
well no because we're giving permission
 
00:29:25.950 --> 00:29:25.960 align:start position:0%
essentially to put those signs up so I I
 
00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
don't know if they had heard gotten a
 
00:29:30.190 --> 00:29:30.200 align:start position:0%
respon resp back from uh the Attorney
 
00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
General's office but they Grant the City
 
00:29:34.029 --> 00:29:34.039 align:start position:0%
of Claremont granted permission for
 
00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
people to put their signs back
 
00:29:39.669 --> 00:29:39.679 align:start position:0%

00:29:52.269 --> 00:29:52.279 align:start position:0%
dry welcome to election
 
00:29:55.630 --> 00:29:55.640 align:start position:0%
law thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:29:58.590 --> 00:29:58.600 align:start position:0%
hearing uh this bill my for the record
 
00:30:00.549 --> 00:30:00.559 align:start position:0%
my name is representative Margaret dry I
 
00:30:03.549 --> 00:30:03.559 align:start position:0%
represent Sullivan County district 7 and
 
00:30:07.029 --> 00:30:07.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:11.080 align:start position:0%
bill I just want to add a a piece of
 
00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
experience as an EMT and a rescue
 
00:30:17.389 --> 00:30:17.399 align:start position:0%
Personnel um for driving around when
 
00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
it's political season uh in our town
 
00:30:23.389 --> 00:30:23.399 align:start position:0%
unfortunately uh it gets surrounded by
 
00:30:26.029 --> 00:30:26.039 align:start position:0%
rumor whether or not political signs are
 
00:30:27.789 --> 00:30:27.799 align:start position:0%
allowed to be placed on the right away
 
00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
or certain sections of town and
 
00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:31.440 align:start position:0%
unfortunately people take advantage of
 
00:30:33.509 --> 00:30:33.519 align:start position:0%
that and put things around stop signs
 
00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
yield signs and places where it
 
00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:38.200 align:start position:0%
distracts drivers because it is um it
 
00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:41.120 align:start position:0%
draws attention to this area below the
 
00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:44.840 align:start position:0%
sign and not the stop sign especially on
 
00:30:46.909 --> 00:30:46.919 align:start position:0%
country country roads where it's sharp
 
00:30:50.830 --> 00:30:50.840 align:start position:0%
corners and uh and often blind driveways
 
00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:53.440 align:start position:0%
um I like this because it it makes it
 
00:30:57.629 --> 00:30:57.639 align:start position:0%
more um of the onus on the asking for
 
00:30:59.149 --> 00:30:59.159 align:start position:0%
Poli iCal
 
00:31:02.149 --> 00:31:02.159 align:start position:0%
subdivision uh permission uh I just hope
 
00:31:05.870 --> 00:31:05.880 align:start position:0%
that political subdivisions understand
 
00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:08.840 align:start position:0%
that it they need to be very specific um
 
00:31:10.990 --> 00:31:11.000 align:start position:0%
because people interpret uh what they
 
00:31:12.470 --> 00:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
mean by public land as a lot of
 
00:31:14.830 --> 00:31:14.840 align:start position:0%
different things in a rural area and I
 
00:31:16.269 --> 00:31:16.279 align:start position:0%
just wanted to bring up that point as
 
00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:18.120 align:start position:0%
we're working on it I know it says you
 
00:31:20.789 --> 00:31:20.799 align:start position:0%
can't interrup the safe flow of traffic
 
00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
but a sign near a stop sign doesn't
 
00:31:24.789 --> 00:31:24.799 align:start position:0%
necessarily interrupt the flow of
 
00:31:28.669 --> 00:31:28.679 align:start position:0%
traffic but it does interrupt the safety
 
00:31:30.149 --> 00:31:30.159 align:start position:0%
thank you will we taking questions from
 
00:31:30.159 --> 00:31:31.789 align:start position:0%

the law currently where political

on public property um and or private uh
 
00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
private property the language contained
 
00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:14.320 align:start position:0%
in this bill is consistent with property
 
00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:16.760 align:start position:0%

14 uh my 19th term in the house for the

last 30 years I believe that RSA 66417
 
00:42:27.950 --> 00:42:27.960 align:start position:0%
gave me as the butter the right to
 
00:42:29.870 --> 00:42:29.880 align:start position:0%
control who placed political advertising
 
00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
on the corner lot where I live I would

take the sign of a candidate whom I did
 
00:42:35.630 --> 00:42:35.640 align:start position:0%

attached to it with a note that I was a
 
00:42:43.630 --> 00:42:43.640 align:start position:0%
butter and this sign does not have my
 
00:42:45.510 --> 00:42:45.520 align:start position:0%
permission sometimes it took more than
 
00:42:47.430 --> 00:42:47.440 align:start position:0%
one notice to cause the sign to be taken
 
00:42:49.829 --> 00:42:49.839 align:start position:0%
away but generally I had cooperation and
 
00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:52.480 align:start position:0%
the signs were removed the last election
 
00:42:54.430 --> 00:42:54.440 align:start position:0%
I had one candidate who was a had a very
 
00:42:56.109 --> 00:42:56.119 align:start position:0%
aggressive campaign attacking the
 
00:42:58.349 --> 00:42:58.359 align:start position:0%
candidate whom I support it I had to
 
00:43:00.910 --> 00:43:00.920 align:start position:0%
remove her sign three times one of her
 
00:43:02.670 --> 00:43:02.680 align:start position:0%
workers came to my house to argue that I
 
00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
had no right to do that her campaign her
 
00:43:07.670 --> 00:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
campaign manager made a fuss and since
 
00:43:09.109 --> 00:43:09.119 align:start position:0%
he had earlier worked with the attorney
 
00:43:11.030 --> 00:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
general he got that office to send me a
 
00:43:14.349 --> 00:43:14.359 align:start position:0%
cease and assist order I passed out
 
00:43:16.190 --> 00:43:16.200 align:start position:0%
about a dozen copies of that half a
 
00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
dozen copies of that I didn't make
 
00:43:20.510 --> 00:43:20.520 align:start position:0%
enough for everybody the CE and deist
 
00:43:22.910 --> 00:43:22.920 align:start position:0%
order made no sense it referred to the
 
00:43:25.109 --> 00:43:25.119 align:start position:0%
abing highway as being purchased by the
 
00:43:27.470 --> 00:43:27.480 align:start position:0%
state under fee simple and gave the
 
00:43:29.030 --> 00:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
impression that the law only applied to
 
00:43:31.150 --> 00:43:31.160 align:start position:0%
a Butters who owned the land over which
 
00:43:33.270 --> 00:43:33.280 align:start position:0%
the road passed that would be a class
 
00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:35.200 align:start position:0%
six Road and would have so little
 
00:43:36.790 --> 00:43:36.800 align:start position:0%
traffic on it that it would not attract
 
00:43:39.270 --> 00:43:39.280 align:start position:0%
any political advertising I've changed
 
00:43:40.510 --> 00:43:40.520 align:start position:0%
the wording of
 
00:43:43.109 --> 00:43:43.119 align:start position:0%
66417 to make it clear that the butter
 
00:43:44.790 --> 00:43:44.800 align:start position:0%
has the right to object to political
 
00:43:47.150 --> 00:43:47.160 align:start position:0%
advertising the right to remove it from
 
00:43:50.109 --> 00:43:50.119 align:start position:0%
display by placing it flat place a copy
 
00:43:51.910 --> 00:43:51.920 align:start position:0%
of this irsa on it with the Butter's
 
00:43:53.950 --> 00:43:53.960 align:start position:0%
name and address I hope that the
 
00:43:55.829 --> 00:43:55.839 align:start position:0%
committee agrees with my reasoning and
 
00:43:58.030 --> 00:43:58.040 align:start position:0%
takes the opportunity to make this law
 
00:44:01.630 --> 00:44:01.640 align:start position:0%
clear and approve the action by by an
 
00:44:03.150 --> 00:44:03.160 align:start position:0%
objecting a
 
00:44:06.150 --> 00:44:06.160 align:start position:0%
butter excuse me which otherwise is
 
00:44:08.430 --> 00:44:08.440 align:start position:0%
lacking the law says you have to have
 
00:44:11.150 --> 00:44:11.160 align:start position:0%
the but's permission but it doesn't say
 
00:44:13.390 --> 00:44:13.400 align:start position:0%
what you do if you don't have it so I'm
 
00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
trying to put the language in there to
 
00:44:17.670 --> 00:44:17.680 align:start position:0%
make it clear you don't just slash it or
 
00:44:21.109 --> 00:44:21.119 align:start position:0%
or tear it up you have to treat it with
 
00:44:23.549 --> 00:44:23.559 align:start position:0%
respect lay it flat so it's not on
 
00:44:25.750 --> 00:44:25.760 align:start position:0%
display and then put this note on it
 
00:44:27.430 --> 00:44:27.440 align:start position:0%
which is what I've been doing for 30
 
00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:30.240 align:start position:0%
years and most people respect it until
 
00:44:33.390 --> 00:44:33.400 align:start position:0%
this person made a fuss and she lost
 
00:44:36.109 --> 00:44:36.119 align:start position:0%
anyway but anyway I'm trying to make it
 
00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
clear that if if the loss said if it's
 
00:44:43.390 --> 00:44:43.400 align:start position:0%
on state right away with without the
 
00:44:45.470 --> 00:44:45.480 align:start position:0%
objection of the abutter that I wanted
 
00:44:46.950 --> 00:44:46.960 align:start position:0%
to make the language clear because
 
00:44:49.030 --> 00:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
obviously this attorney general did not
 
00:44:51.510 --> 00:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
understand it so I hope you can support
 
00:44:54.109 --> 00:44:54.119 align:start position:0%
it and and improve the law by and this
 
00:44:55.990 --> 00:44:56.000 align:start position:0%
law gets amended every few years anyway
 
00:44:57.670 --> 00:44:57.680 align:start position:0%
as you've seen so
 
00:44:59.270 --> 00:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
That's My Hope thank you I'd be happy to
 
00:45:01.230 --> 00:45:01.240 align:start position:0%
answer any questions thank you
 
00:45:02.910 --> 00:45:02.920 align:start position:0%
representative are there any questions
 
00:45:04.750 --> 00:45:04.760 align:start position:0%
from the
 
00:45:08.150 --> 00:45:08.160 align:start position:0%
committee representative Mirad thank you
 
00:45:11.470 --> 00:45:11.480 align:start position:0%
Mr Vice chair
 
00:45:14.670 --> 00:45:14.680 align:start position:0%
um looking at the proposed legislation
 
00:45:16.950 --> 00:45:16.960 align:start position:0%
it looks like it makes two changes one
 
00:45:19.549 --> 00:45:19.559 align:start position:0%
is it has this process for what to do
 
00:45:22.430 --> 00:45:22.440 align:start position:0%
when there's something there um which
 
00:45:25.670 --> 00:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
makes which I appreciate um and another
 
00:45:27.630 --> 00:45:27.640 align:start position:0%
thing is it changes the language
 
00:45:30.190 --> 00:45:30.200 align:start position:0%
from um owner of the land over which the
 
00:45:32.430 --> 00:45:32.440 align:start position:0%
ride of way passes to property owner
 
00:45:35.910 --> 00:45:35.920 align:start position:0%
who's the closest to butter and and and
 
00:45:38.030 --> 00:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
thinking about that change it it gave me
 
00:45:39.309 --> 00:45:39.319 align:start position:0%
just a little bit of caution because I'm
 
00:45:40.270 --> 00:45:40.280 align:start position:0%
thinking about for instance an
 
00:45:42.589 --> 00:45:42.599 align:start position:0%
intersection in Newport where a couple
 
00:45:44.990 --> 00:45:45.000 align:start position:0%
State highways intersect and there's a
 
00:45:46.870 --> 00:45:46.880 align:start position:0%
state park there and the nearest to
 
00:45:48.829 --> 00:45:48.839 align:start position:0%
butter is actually quite a way away from
 
00:45:51.510 --> 00:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
the intersection but now the near under
 
00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:52.960 align:start position:0%
this language the nearest to butter
 
00:45:55.589 --> 00:45:55.599 align:start position:0%
would have the ability to come in and
 
00:45:57.470 --> 00:45:57.480 align:start position:0%
and monitor the signage even though
 
00:45:59.030 --> 00:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
their property is not actually very
 
00:46:00.950 --> 00:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
close to that intersection they they're
 
00:46:04.230 --> 00:46:04.240 align:start position:0%
the closest to butter um and so I wonder
 
00:46:07.190 --> 00:46:07.200 align:start position:0%
could we keep the old language that says
 
00:46:09.790 --> 00:46:09.800 align:start position:0%
over which the RightWay passes well if
 
00:46:12.990 --> 00:46:13.000 align:start position:0%
we have an attorney general who assumes
 
00:46:14.750 --> 00:46:14.760 align:start position:0%
that's a class six
 
00:46:17.790 --> 00:46:17.800 align:start position:0%
Highway and goes on about the fee simple
 
00:46:19.150 --> 00:46:19.160 align:start position:0%
oh no we bought that so you don't have
 
00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:19.950 align:start position:0%
oh no we bought that so you don't have
any

00:46:19.950 --> 00:46:19.960 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:46:23.829 --> 00:46:23.839 align:start position:0%
rights nobody knows who who bought the
 
00:46:25.589 --> 00:46:25.599 align:start position:0%
road that goes by their property you
 
00:46:27.190 --> 00:46:27.200 align:start position:0%
don't know whether it's fee simp simp Le
 
00:46:30.230 --> 00:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
class 5 class you know I I'm on a class
 
00:46:32.829 --> 00:46:32.839 align:start position:0%
so one of the I'm on this corner class
 
00:46:36.230 --> 00:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
one and class two where class two is
 
00:46:38.309 --> 00:46:38.319 align:start position:0%
going to a state park and class one is a
 
00:46:41.790 --> 00:46:41.800 align:start position:0%
major highway okay I wouldn't have any
 
00:46:43.470 --> 00:46:43.480 align:start position:0%
right according to this attorney general
 
00:46:45.430 --> 00:46:45.440 align:start position:0%
because they bought it under fee simple
 
00:46:48.069 --> 00:46:48.079 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to straighten him out it's
 
00:46:49.750 --> 00:46:49.760 align:start position:0%
either it's it's got to fit in one of
 
00:46:52.589 --> 00:46:52.599 align:start position:0%
these classes and if if it claims the
 
00:46:54.430 --> 00:46:54.440 align:start position:0%
right away over
 
00:46:57.390 --> 00:46:57.400 align:start position:0%
which the road passes the the right away
 
00:46:59.990 --> 00:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
over over your property that's a class
 
00:47:02.710 --> 00:47:02.720 align:start position:0%
six Road well you own if it's abandoned
 
00:47:04.549 --> 00:47:04.559 align:start position:0%
you own to the middle of the road so in
 
00:47:06.470 --> 00:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
effect you have some ownership of that
 
00:47:09.990 --> 00:47:10.000 align:start position:0%
road if it's discontinued as a RightWay
 
00:47:11.829 --> 00:47:11.839 align:start position:0%
that's the misunderstanding that that
 
00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:14.640 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to do away with which
 
00:47:17.270 --> 00:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
obviously this attorney general says oh
 
00:47:20.030 --> 00:47:20.040 align:start position:0%
no we own this fee simple and only it
 
00:47:22.390 --> 00:47:22.400 align:start position:0%
only applies to the Landover right and I
 
00:47:24.549 --> 00:47:24.559 align:start position:0%
said you know at one point the property
 
00:47:26.910 --> 00:47:26.920 align:start position:0%
I bought that Highway had been widened
 
00:47:28.589 --> 00:47:28.599 align:start position:0%
and had been taken from the property
 
00:47:31.990 --> 00:47:32.000 align:start position:0%
that I bought so is that the owner of
 
00:47:33.470 --> 00:47:33.480 align:start position:0%
the land over which the RightWay passes
 
00:47:35.710 --> 00:47:35.720 align:start position:0%
so no well no no we own it on a fee
 
00:47:38.510 --> 00:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
simple you don't seem to understand why
 
00:47:41.670 --> 00:47:41.680 align:start position:0%
would I put advertising on a class six
 
00:47:44.630 --> 00:47:44.640 align:start position:0%
Highway nobody goes down it but that's
 
00:47:47.309 --> 00:47:47.319 align:start position:0%
his interpretation so I want to make it
 
00:47:49.990 --> 00:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
clear now in this case of the so here's
 
00:47:51.470 --> 00:47:51.480 align:start position:0%
here's the land it comes across like
 
00:47:53.510 --> 00:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
this then there's a couple of
 
00:47:55.670 --> 00:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
islands I don't have anything to do with
 
00:47:57.510 --> 00:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
the islands I figure so so it's the same
 
00:48:00.589 --> 00:48:00.599 align:start position:0%
thing I'm the nearest to butter to this
 
00:48:03.150 --> 00:48:03.160 align:start position:0%
corner but if if there's something
 
00:48:05.910 --> 00:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
interven in intervening in the way that
 
00:48:08.470 --> 00:48:08.480 align:start position:0%
is public stuff then you're not quite
 
00:48:11.670 --> 00:48:11.680 align:start position:0%
the nearest to butter um as you say
 
00:48:13.349 --> 00:48:13.359 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a park and those other
 
00:48:14.270 --> 00:48:14.280 align:start position:0%
things I'd have to look at the
 
00:48:15.589 --> 00:48:15.599 align:start position:0%
intersection to give you a real good
 
00:48:18.309 --> 00:48:18.319 align:start position:0%
answer but I don't think the nearest to
 
00:48:21.349 --> 00:48:21.359 align:start position:0%
butter if you're 200 feet away and you
 
00:48:23.470 --> 00:48:23.480 align:start position:0%
you can't even see it but the idea is
 
00:48:25.190 --> 00:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
everybody knows who I am who I support
 
00:48:27.630 --> 00:48:27.640 align:start position:0%
if somebody that's I support sticks a
 
00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
sign in front of my property and
 
00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
somebody says I voted for him because
 
00:48:34.430 --> 00:48:34.440 align:start position:0%
you had a sign there that wasn't who I
 
00:48:36.430 --> 00:48:36.440 align:start position:0%
was support but I couldn't remove the
 
00:48:38.230 --> 00:48:38.240 align:start position:0%
sign because I had a cease and assist
 
00:48:41.190 --> 00:48:41.200 align:start position:0%
that doesn't seem right if it if the
 
00:48:43.510 --> 00:48:43.520 align:start position:0%
first written law said you needed
 
00:48:47.470 --> 00:48:47.480 align:start position:0%
permission of the person of whose
 
00:48:49.750 --> 00:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
property the right away passes and so if
 
00:48:51.309 --> 00:48:51.319 align:start position:0%
it's going to be misinterpreted by an
 
00:48:53.109 --> 00:48:53.119 align:start position:0%
attorney general I wanted to make it a
 
00:48:55.069 --> 00:48:55.079 align:start position:0%
little clearer so I put in the nearest
 
00:48:57.470 --> 00:48:57.480 align:start position:0%
the butter I hope it doesn't
 
00:48:59.109 --> 00:48:59.119 align:start position:0%
that situation is rare enough that
 
00:49:00.829 --> 00:49:00.839 align:start position:0%
somebody says no you weren't the nearest
 
00:49:02.710 --> 00:49:02.720 align:start position:0%
to butter because all this public
 
00:49:05.309 --> 00:49:05.319 align:start position:0%
property was here in the in the interim
 
00:49:06.910 --> 00:49:06.920 align:start position:0%
which wasn't known by you and it wasn't
 
00:49:10.470 --> 00:49:10.480 align:start position:0%
part of the RightWay so that was my
 
00:49:13.870 --> 00:49:13.880 align:start position:0%
interpretation do you see my point I do
 
00:49:15.470 --> 00:49:15.480 align:start position:0%
thank you thank
 
00:49:24.190 --> 00:49:24.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:27.349 --> 00:49:27.359 align:start position:0%
committee okay representative
 
00:49:29.030 --> 00:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Vice chair and thank you
 
00:49:32.190 --> 00:49:32.200 align:start position:0%
for taking my question just um I'm just
 
00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:34.270 align:start position:0%
for taking my question just um I'm just
curious

00:49:34.270 --> 00:49:34.280 align:start position:0%
curious
 
00:49:37.470 --> 00:49:37.480 align:start position:0%
uh about the mechanism for remedying
 
00:49:39.990 --> 00:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
when you find these signs uh
 
00:49:43.950 --> 00:49:43.960 align:start position:0%
objectionable signs placed
 
00:49:47.309 --> 00:49:47.319 align:start position:0%
um if if you were found removing them do
 
00:49:50.750 --> 00:49:50.760 align:start position:0%
you you know is it would an alternate
 
00:49:53.270 --> 00:49:53.280 align:start position:0%
possibility to contact authorities to
 
00:49:56.150 --> 00:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
ask them to remove it rather than have
 
00:49:58.670 --> 00:49:58.680 align:start position:0%
you as the abutter removing them and and
 
00:50:00.430 --> 00:50:00.440 align:start position:0%
kind of running the risk of being
 
00:50:04.910 --> 00:50:04.920 align:start position:0%
misinterpreted or misconstrued as uh
 
00:50:07.589 --> 00:50:07.599 align:start position:0%
removing signs improperly when I when I
 
00:50:09.430 --> 00:50:09.440 align:start position:0%
go to remove the sign I have a copy of
 
00:50:12.030 --> 00:50:12.040 align:start position:0%
664 in my hand that I'm going to tape to
 
00:50:14.150 --> 00:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
the sign if anybody comes say sayy
 
00:50:16.670 --> 00:50:16.680 align:start position:0%
you're illegal say read the law here I
 
00:50:19.349 --> 00:50:19.359 align:start position:0%
am I wrote my name and address on here I
 
00:50:21.470 --> 00:50:21.480 align:start position:0%
can show you my ID I'm the guy that's
 
00:50:24.270 --> 00:50:24.280 align:start position:0%
written the note I'm leaving it on the
 
00:50:27.069 --> 00:50:27.079 align:start position:0%
sign otherwise it might take two weeks
 
00:50:28.870 --> 00:50:28.880 align:start position:0%
before the authorities got there to
 
00:50:31.430 --> 00:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
remove it or it it wouldn't happen
 
00:50:33.510 --> 00:50:33.520 align:start position:0%
immediately but I've had signs that
 
00:50:35.309 --> 00:50:35.319 align:start position:0%
somebody complained about blocking their
 
00:50:39.150 --> 00:50:39.160 align:start position:0%
view they were gone pretty quick but you
 
00:50:41.030 --> 00:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
know I'm not sure if I called up and
 
00:50:42.910 --> 00:50:42.920 align:start position:0%
said I don't like so and so
 
00:50:45.190 --> 00:50:45.200 align:start position:0%
sign whether they whether they'd get to
 
00:50:46.589 --> 00:50:46.599 align:start position:0%
it right away and say yeah yeah we'll
 
00:50:49.190 --> 00:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
get to it I just figure that you know
 
00:50:50.710 --> 00:50:50.720 align:start position:0%
especially if it's the same person I've
 
00:50:53.150 --> 00:50:53.160 align:start position:0%
sent the note to they just ignore it and
 
00:50:55.470 --> 00:50:55.480 align:start position:0%
put the sign up again I'm going to take
 
00:50:58.670 --> 00:50:58.680 align:start position:0%
it down again the town might not be that
 
00:50:58.680 --> 00:51:01.789 align:start position:0%
it down again the town might not be that
quick

00:51:01.789 --> 00:51:01.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:04.910 --> 00:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
so but I think it we do need to describe
 
00:51:08.549 --> 00:51:08.559 align:start position:0%
in the law what you can do if you
 
00:51:11.150 --> 00:51:11.160 align:start position:0%
object representative Nome thank you
 
00:51:12.829 --> 00:51:12.839 align:start position:0%
very much thanks for taking my question
 
00:51:14.109 --> 00:51:14.119 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
00:51:16.670 --> 00:51:16.680 align:start position:0%
66417 which is the statute that you
 
00:51:18.870 --> 00:51:18.880 align:start position:0%
cited as giving you permission to take
 
00:51:21.230 --> 00:51:21.240 align:start position:0%
down these signs it says no political
 
00:51:23.309 --> 00:51:23.319 align:start position:0%
advertising shall be placed or on or
 
00:51:25.710 --> 00:51:25.720 align:start position:0%
affixed to any public property including
 
00:51:27.990 --> 00:51:28.000 align:start position:0%
Highway rights of or private property
 
00:51:30.150 --> 00:51:30.160 align:start position:0%
without the owner's
 
00:51:34.549 --> 00:51:34.559 align:start position:0%
consent does this your bill expand that
 
00:51:36.589 --> 00:51:36.599 align:start position:0%
to then a butter so if that right of way
 
00:51:39.470 --> 00:51:39.480 align:start position:0%
is across my land you as a butter would
 
00:51:42.990 --> 00:51:43.000 align:start position:0%
now have control over what signs I put
 
00:51:45.870 --> 00:51:45.880 align:start position:0%
up it seems to be these two the bill and
 
00:51:49.349 --> 00:51:49.359 align:start position:0%
the existing statute are in Conflict how
 
00:51:51.870 --> 00:51:51.880 align:start position:0%
do you feel so where is your property
 
00:51:53.390 --> 00:51:53.400 align:start position:0%
and where is where am I the nearest the
 
00:51:55.030 --> 00:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
butter well I'm just looking at the
 
00:51:57.390 --> 00:51:57.400 align:start position:0%
statute that requires the
 
00:52:00.150 --> 00:52:00.160 align:start position:0%
permission from the owner and not it
 
00:52:04.390 --> 00:52:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:09.030 --> 00:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
66417 so if you were renting a property
 
00:52:12.150 --> 00:52:12.160 align:start position:0%
and you're well known in a certain party
 
00:52:13.950 --> 00:52:13.960 align:start position:0%
and somebody else stuck signs in front
 
00:52:15.789 --> 00:52:15.799 align:start position:0%
of you and they said you can't have no
 
00:52:19.230 --> 00:52:19.240 align:start position:0%
right to remove it but I'm saying if all
 
00:52:20.270 --> 00:52:20.280 align:start position:0%
of a sudden people say what did you
 
00:52:22.470 --> 00:52:22.480 align:start position:0%
change your party why are you supporting
 
00:52:25.430 --> 00:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
him or her and you know this way it's
 
00:52:27.270 --> 00:52:27.280 align:start position:0%
clear if you're if it's sitting in front
 
00:52:28.630 --> 00:52:28.640 align:start position:0%
of where you
 
00:52:30.670 --> 00:52:30.680 align:start position:0%
live then you should have the right to
 
00:52:33.190 --> 00:52:33.200 align:start position:0%
say I don't want that sign
 
00:52:36.190 --> 00:52:36.200 align:start position:0%
there so I'm I think that's what the
 
00:52:38.710 --> 00:52:38.720 align:start position:0%
original Law intended and the original
 
00:52:40.309 --> 00:52:40.319 align:start position:0%
Law assumed that everybody who lived in
 
00:52:42.750 --> 00:52:42.760 align:start position:0%
house that they owned rather than rented
 
00:52:46.589 --> 00:52:46.599 align:start position:0%
or or whatever but it it seemed to work
 
00:52:49.109 --> 00:52:49.119 align:start position:0%
for years until these people start
 
00:52:50.670 --> 00:52:50.680 align:start position:0%
dealing with the attorney generals that
 
00:52:51.950 --> 00:52:51.960 align:start position:0%
don't know the difference between a
 
00:52:53.910 --> 00:52:53.920 align:start position:0%
class five and a class six
 
00:52:57.510 --> 00:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
road so and especially
 
00:52:59.870 --> 00:52:59.880 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead uh what exactly is the
 
00:53:02.030 --> 00:53:02.040 align:start position:0%
difference statutorily or whatever with
 
00:53:04.230 --> 00:53:04.240 align:start position:0%
the five and six because I thought that
 
00:53:06.470 --> 00:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
the default rule in New Hampshire is
 
00:53:08.069 --> 00:53:08.079 align:start position:0%
that the landowner owns to the center of
 
00:53:10.589 --> 00:53:10.599 align:start position:0%
the road not just on class six it
 
00:53:14.030 --> 00:53:14.040 align:start position:0%
certainly happens when a class six road
 
00:53:17.270 --> 00:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
is thrown up that then the two abutters
 
00:53:19.309 --> 00:53:19.319 align:start position:0%
along that right of way own to the
 
00:53:23.190 --> 00:53:23.200 align:start position:0%
center line but they own that either way
 
00:53:25.230 --> 00:53:25.240 align:start position:0%
even if it's not given up in many roads
 
00:53:28.349 --> 00:53:28.359 align:start position:0%
that is the default in the state I that
 
00:53:30.030 --> 00:53:30.040 align:start position:0%
was my impression at least we may
 
00:53:31.670 --> 00:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
disagree that's fine though the class
 
00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:32.789 align:start position:0%
disagree that's fine though the class
one

00:53:32.789 --> 00:53:32.799 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:53:34.510 --> 00:53:34.520 align:start position:0%
road not
 
00:53:38.430 --> 00:53:38.440 align:start position:0%
only does it take all the pavement but
 
00:53:40.950 --> 00:53:40.960 align:start position:0%
it has the shoulders and the drainage
 
00:53:43.150 --> 00:53:43.160 align:start position:0%
ditches and all that and it may go
 
00:53:46.069 --> 00:53:46.079 align:start position:0%
anywhere from 35 to 40 ft and so it
 
00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:49.200 align:start position:0%
turns out that most of us mowing the
 
00:53:51.670 --> 00:53:51.680 align:start position:0%
grass we're mowing the state's property
 
00:53:53.470 --> 00:53:53.480 align:start position:0%
and that's why we put a law in there
 
00:53:55.270 --> 00:53:55.280 align:start position:0%
with an exception let's say you mowed
 
00:53:57.349 --> 00:53:57.359 align:start position:0%
your neighbor's grass for for 20 years
 
00:53:59.630 --> 00:53:59.640 align:start position:0%
you could claim it was yours you can't
 
00:54:01.630 --> 00:54:01.640 align:start position:0%
do that with the state right away we put
 
00:54:04.150 --> 00:54:04.160 align:start position:0%
in a specific thing most people don't
 
00:54:06.630 --> 00:54:06.640 align:start position:0%
know where the state owns to and every
 
00:54:08.309 --> 00:54:08.319 align:start position:0%
once in a while when I look at a map and
 
00:54:10.910 --> 00:54:10.920 align:start position:0%
go to the the registry of deeds it
 
00:54:13.390 --> 00:54:13.400 align:start position:0%
varies it's what was available for them
 
00:54:17.549 --> 00:54:17.559 align:start position:0%
to take in some cases it goes 20 feet
 
00:54:19.190 --> 00:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
into what you think is your
 
00:54:22.030 --> 00:54:22.040 align:start position:0%
property and that's what they bought
 
00:54:23.430 --> 00:54:23.440 align:start position:0%
because that was what available when
 
00:54:25.349 --> 00:54:25.359 align:start position:0%
they bought when they put the road in
 
00:54:27.870 --> 00:54:27.880 align:start position:0%
and that's what they decided to take and
 
00:54:29.670 --> 00:54:29.680 align:start position:0%
sometimes because of drainage ditches
 
00:54:32.670 --> 00:54:32.680 align:start position:0%
and and and culs and things they took a
 
00:54:36.230 --> 00:54:36.240 align:start position:0%
little more in some places so very few
 
00:54:38.710 --> 00:54:38.720 align:start position:0%
of us know exactly where the edge of the
 
00:54:41.430 --> 00:54:41.440 align:start position:0%
state's property on the road and our own
 
00:54:44.589 --> 00:54:44.599 align:start position:0%
is so I just want to make it clear since
 
00:54:46.630 --> 00:54:46.640 align:start position:0%
they could put something right almost
 
00:54:49.270 --> 00:54:49.280 align:start position:0%
next to my steps and say oh I just
 
00:54:51.030 --> 00:54:51.040 align:start position:0%
looked it up in the county they actually
 
00:54:52.829 --> 00:54:52.839 align:start position:0%
own right up to your
 
00:54:55.270 --> 00:54:55.280 align:start position:0%
steps i' say wow I hadn't gone and
 
00:54:57.109 --> 00:54:57.119 align:start position:0%
looked at that but that's that's the way
 
00:54:58.349 --> 00:54:58.359 align:start position:0%
some of the properties are when I
 
00:54:59.510 --> 00:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
researched them I was on the planning
 
00:55:00.910 --> 00:55:00.920 align:start position:0%
board for years and we look at these
 
00:55:04.549 --> 00:55:04.559 align:start position:0%
things and it would vary and sometimes
 
00:55:06.150 --> 00:55:06.160 align:start position:0%
they took so much land they'd be willing
 
00:55:09.430 --> 00:55:09.440 align:start position:0%
to sell it and one of my neighbors they
 
00:55:11.309 --> 00:55:11.319 align:start position:0%
they took a piece of property that would
 
00:55:14.230 --> 00:55:14.240 align:start position:0%
have allowed him to expand his business
 
00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:15.190 align:start position:0%
have allowed him to expand his business
and

00:55:15.190 --> 00:55:15.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:55:17.670 --> 00:55:17.680 align:start position:0%
I called up the real estate people and
 
00:55:19.270 --> 00:55:19.280 align:start position:0%
they were very slow in getting back to
 
00:55:22.789 --> 00:55:22.799 align:start position:0%
us and saying we haven't decided yet but
 
00:55:24.349 --> 00:55:24.359 align:start position:0%
he's been trying for years to get this
 
00:55:25.870 --> 00:55:25.880 align:start position:0%
piece of property because they took a
 
00:55:26.950 --> 00:55:26.960 align:start position:0%
whole house
 
00:55:30.150 --> 00:55:30.160 align:start position:0%
slot they were moving the road apart
 
00:55:32.190 --> 00:55:32.200 align:start position:0%
expanding the highway this is again on
 
00:55:35.270 --> 00:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
125 and it came so close to the person's
 
00:55:37.069 --> 00:55:37.079 align:start position:0%
property they didn't want to keep the
 
00:55:39.109 --> 00:55:39.119 align:start position:0%
house anymore so I think it came right
 
00:55:41.390 --> 00:55:41.400 align:start position:0%
into the house so they said all right we
 
00:55:43.430 --> 00:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
got to take the whole thing so now they
 
00:55:46.910 --> 00:55:46.920 align:start position:0%
got that house was fairly close to the
 
00:55:48.870 --> 00:55:48.880 align:start position:0%
to the front of the property once they
 
00:55:52.710 --> 00:55:52.720 align:start position:0%
took the house it was another 200 ft
 
00:55:55.150 --> 00:55:55.160 align:start position:0%
behind it that they had to take so
 
00:55:57.109 --> 00:55:57.119 align:start position:0%
here's the butter wants to buy that
 
00:55:59.349 --> 00:55:59.359 align:start position:0%
piece to enlarge his business and still
 
00:56:02.390 --> 00:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
safe far enough away from the highway so
 
00:56:04.630 --> 00:56:04.640 align:start position:0%
you don't never you never know exactly
 
00:56:06.349 --> 00:56:06.359 align:start position:0%
how wide that right away is that they
 
00:56:08.510 --> 00:56:08.520 align:start position:0%
took it's my point I've discovered that
 
00:56:09.910 --> 00:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
from years of being on the planning
 
00:56:14.589 --> 00:56:14.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:17.109 --> 00:56:17.119 align:start position:0%
you uh representative
 
00:56:20.309 --> 00:56:20.319 align:start position:0%
C thank you for taking my question um
 
00:56:22.950 --> 00:56:22.960 align:start position:0%
you'd mentioned U tenants and I just got
 
00:56:25.390 --> 00:56:25.400 align:start position:0%
to wondering what happens if the tenant
 
00:56:29.430 --> 00:56:29.440 align:start position:0%
and the building owner don't
 
00:56:31.789 --> 00:56:31.799 align:start position:0%
agree I think the building owner would
 
00:56:33.910 --> 00:56:33.920 align:start position:0%
have the right to say I don't want this
 
00:56:36.829 --> 00:56:36.839 align:start position:0%
on my property it does it's not included
 
00:56:37.829 --> 00:56:37.839 align:start position:0%
in your
 
00:56:41.470 --> 00:56:41.480 align:start position:0%
lease so you know but I've seen it
 
00:56:44.829 --> 00:56:44.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:47.309 --> 00:56:47.319 align:start position:0%
ways by representative
 
00:56:50.349 --> 00:56:50.359 align:start position:0%
toner thank you um I just had a question
 
00:56:52.109 --> 00:56:52.119 align:start position:0%
so like I'm just trying to play this
 
00:56:55.510 --> 00:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
through my mind um so in your situation
 
00:56:55.520 --> 00:56:57.230 align:start position:0%
through my mind um so in your situation
for

00:56:57.230 --> 00:56:57.240 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:57:00.309 --> 00:57:00.319 align:start position:0%
Simplicity is it a scenario where
 
00:57:02.589 --> 00:57:02.599 align:start position:0%
basically you have whatever Main Highway
 
00:57:05.390 --> 00:57:05.400 align:start position:0%
going and you're say your property lines
 
00:57:08.670 --> 00:57:08.680 align:start position:0%
are perpendicular for Simplicity to that
 
00:57:11.670 --> 00:57:11.680 align:start position:0%
Highway and obviously they can own 50
 
00:57:13.549 --> 00:57:13.559 align:start position:0%
feet 100 feet off the center line up
 
00:57:15.589 --> 00:57:15.599 align:start position:0%
into your property is that the scenario
 
00:57:17.109 --> 00:57:17.119 align:start position:0%
that's playing out here that basically
 
00:57:19.829 --> 00:57:19.839 align:start position:0%
someone put a
 
00:57:22.430 --> 00:57:22.440 align:start position:0%
sign right up next to the edge of the
 
00:57:26.270 --> 00:57:26.280 align:start position:0%
highway and it happens to be in between
 
00:57:28.549 --> 00:57:28.559 align:start position:0%
more or less the the property lines of
 
00:57:30.589 --> 00:57:30.599 align:start position:0%
your piece of property yeah my my
 
00:57:32.430 --> 00:57:32.440 align:start position:0%
property runs about a thousand feet
 
00:57:35.510 --> 00:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
along 125 so I sometimes use that as I
 
00:57:38.549 --> 00:57:38.559 align:start position:0%
am the abutter m and then I my house
 
00:57:42.390 --> 00:57:42.400 align:start position:0%
faces on another road that goes into 125
 
00:57:43.630 --> 00:57:43.640 align:start position:0%
that's where I live and then it goes
 
00:57:46.870 --> 00:57:46.880 align:start position:0%
around the corner but my property goes
 
00:57:49.230 --> 00:57:49.240 align:start position:0%
AB buts both Highway the highway and my
 
00:57:52.430 --> 00:57:52.440 align:start position:0%
the road I use as my address so I own
 
00:57:54.470 --> 00:57:54.480 align:start position:0%
the corner lot which I say gives me
 
00:57:57.470 --> 00:57:57.480 align:start position:0%
control of the corner and as it is I AB
 
00:58:00.750 --> 00:58:00.760 align:start position:0%
but 125 as I say for 1,000 ft so I
 
00:58:02.630 --> 00:58:02.640 align:start position:0%
assume that I could say anywhere along
 
00:58:04.349 --> 00:58:04.359 align:start position:0%
there I object to
 
00:58:07.789 --> 00:58:07.799 align:start position:0%
this that's that's what I'm saying so it
 
00:58:09.950 --> 00:58:09.960 align:start position:0%
would in my mind I'm the nearest to
 
00:58:12.870 --> 00:58:12.880 align:start position:0%
butter so but here's this little islands
 
00:58:16.390 --> 00:58:16.400 align:start position:0%
that go like this I don't try to claim
 
00:58:18.029 --> 00:58:18.039 align:start position:0%
control over them because they're
 
00:58:21.549 --> 00:58:21.559 align:start position:0%
between the road this road and that road
 
00:58:23.870 --> 00:58:23.880 align:start position:0%
so lots of things get put on those
 
00:58:25.510 --> 00:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
islands that I object to but I don't
 
00:58:26.990 --> 00:58:27.000 align:start position:0%
figure I have the the right the same as
 
00:58:30.150 --> 00:58:30.160 align:start position:0%
I do or I'm in the butter thank
 
00:58:34.029 --> 00:58:34.039 align:start position:0%
you further questions from the
 
00:58:36.870 --> 00:58:36.880 align:start position:0%
committee uh representative Harvey
 
00:58:40.069 --> 00:58:40.079 align:start position:0%
bullier thank you Mr chair um just a
 
00:58:42.630 --> 00:58:42.640 align:start position:0%
quick question uh I thank you for
 
00:58:44.789 --> 00:58:44.799 align:start position:0%
bringing up this bill because I've often
 
00:58:48.109 --> 00:58:48.119 align:start position:0%
wondered about this sort of piece of law
 
00:58:50.309 --> 00:58:50.319 align:start position:0%
but assuming I'm thinking of samton
 
00:58:52.349 --> 00:58:52.359 align:start position:0%
Center where there's an island very
 
00:58:54.910 --> 00:58:54.920 align:start position:0%
popular for sticking signs in and I
 
00:58:56.710 --> 00:58:56.720 align:start position:0%
don't assume you can see all the way
 
00:58:59.549 --> 00:58:59.559 align:start position:0%
over but assuming there's an abutter
 
00:59:01.789 --> 00:59:01.799 align:start position:0%
there's two roads sort of intersecting
 
00:59:03.750 --> 00:59:03.760 align:start position:0%
and there's an AB butter on either side
 
00:59:06.390 --> 00:59:06.400 align:start position:0%
they have differing political opinions I
 
00:59:09.029 --> 00:59:09.039 align:start position:0%
know how do how would that work out
 
00:59:11.430 --> 00:59:11.440 align:start position:0%
would you say is where they're kind of
 
00:59:13.190 --> 00:59:13.200 align:start position:0%
equidistant they they're they don't AB
 
00:59:14.750 --> 00:59:14.760 align:start position:0%
but that
 
00:59:18.029 --> 00:59:18.039 align:start position:0%
diamond they on their side of the road
 
00:59:21.230 --> 00:59:21.240 align:start position:0%
they're an abutter but the diamond yeah
 
00:59:24.029 --> 00:59:24.039 align:start position:0%
nope that's just Frontage then it's
 
00:59:27.349 --> 00:59:27.359 align:start position:0%
Frontage okay two L on the inside
 
00:59:29.829 --> 00:59:29.839 align:start position:0%
excuse me yeah one person at a time
 
00:59:32.109 --> 00:59:32.119 align:start position:0%
speaking and I would like to make a note
 
00:59:34.470 --> 00:59:34.480 align:start position:0%
that if we could stick to the specifics
 
00:59:37.549 --> 00:59:37.559 align:start position:0%
of the bill with regard to our questions
 
00:59:41.069 --> 00:59:41.079 align:start position:0%
I think that would be more helpful thank
 
00:59:43.710 --> 00:59:43.720 align:start position:0%
you now I want to make it clear that not
 
00:59:47.950 --> 00:59:47.960 align:start position:0%
only the the rights of way the state's
 
00:59:50.349 --> 00:59:50.359 align:start position:0%
rights of way that AB but your property
 
00:59:52.670 --> 00:59:52.680 align:start position:0%
but also the method you have to do if
 
00:59:55.270 --> 00:59:55.280 align:start position:0%
you object because it the present law
 
00:59:57.109 --> 00:59:57.119 align:start position:0%
doesn't give you any any way to deal
 
00:59:57.119 --> 00:59:58.309 align:start position:0%
doesn't give you any any way to deal
with

00:59:58.309 --> 00:59:58.319 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:00:01.190 --> 01:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
it that's the point I want to make I
 
01:00:02.870 --> 01:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
might you might end up combining this
 
01:00:04.870 --> 01:00:04.880 align:start position:0%
law and the previous law however you
 
01:00:07.069 --> 01:00:07.079 align:start position:0%
want them do it in the committee but I
 
01:00:10.589 --> 01:00:10.599 align:start position:0%
hope you you keep both the the rights of
 
01:00:12.870 --> 01:00:12.880 align:start position:0%
the abutter and the rights and the
 
01:00:14.990 --> 01:00:15.000 align:start position:0%
method to deal with something you object
 
01:00:17.750 --> 01:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
to otherwise it's not in the
 
01:00:20.109 --> 01:00:20.119 align:start position:0%
law thank you are there any other
 
01:00:23.829 --> 01:00:23.839 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee yes
 
01:00:25.549 --> 01:00:25.559 align:start position:0%
directed more towards the specifics of
 
01:00:27.750 --> 01:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
this particular
 
01:00:31.470 --> 01:00:31.480 align:start position:0%

work uh to basically document the
 
01:03:44.349 --> 01:03:44.359 align:start position:0%
problems that they found with various

01:04:15.430 --> 01:04:15.440 align:start position:0%
general uh now what kind of issues are
 
01:04:18.230 --> 01:04:18.240 align:start position:0%
we talking about talking about absentee
 
01:04:21.750 --> 01:04:21.760 align:start position:0%
ballot controls and Rec Rec uh
 
01:04:24.109 --> 01:04:24.119 align:start position:0%
reconciliation talking about the
 
01:04:26.230 --> 01:04:26.240 align:start position:0%
counting machine's qualification and
 
01:04:28.510 --> 01:04:28.520 align:start position:0%
operations we're talking about multiple
 
01:04:30.870 --> 01:04:30.880 align:start position:0%
chain of custody issues with
 
01:04:33.510 --> 01:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
inappropriately sealed boxes missing
 
01:04:36.870 --> 01:04:36.880 align:start position:0%
signatures inaccurate vote counts things
 
01:04:39.910 --> 01:04:39.920 align:start position:0%
in the wrong boxes that are totally
 
01:04:44.950 --> 01:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
mislabeled um so over aund and over a
 
01:04:48.470 --> 01:04:48.480 align:start position:0%
hundred violations were
 
01:04:50.990 --> 01:04:51.000 align:start position:0%
noted uh and
 
01:04:53.990 --> 01:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
including over approximately
 
01:04:58.029 --> 01:04:58.039 align:start position:0%
2400 moved voters people who had moved
 
01:05:00.549 --> 01:05:00.559 align:start position:0%
out of the towns still on the
 
01:05:00.559 --> 01:05:02.750 align:start position:0%
out of the towns still on the
registration

01:05:02.750 --> 01:05:02.760 align:start position:0%
registration
 
01:05:06.950 --> 01:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
lists so uh and lastly missing the
 
01:05:09.990 --> 01:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
required continuity operation plan which
 
01:05:12.430 --> 01:05:12.440 align:start position:0%
every town is supposed to have for when
 
01:05:15.349 --> 01:05:15.359 align:start position:0%
things go south during your election
 
01:05:18.470 --> 01:05:18.480 align:start position:0%
process so all these violations were
 
01:05:21.950 --> 01:05:21.960 align:start position:0%
heard and acknowledged by the ballot law
 
01:05:24.309 --> 01:05:24.319 align:start position:0%
commission and they did not believe that
 
01:05:26.109 --> 01:05:26.119 align:start position:0%
they had the authority to take any
 
01:05:28.150 --> 01:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
action on them but they believe they
 
01:05:31.190 --> 01:05:31.200 align:start position:0%
were they were legitimate violations so
 
01:05:32.589 --> 01:05:32.599 align:start position:0%
so so they turned them over to the
 
01:05:32.599 --> 01:05:33.789 align:start position:0%
so so they turned them over to the
attorney

01:05:33.789 --> 01:05:33.799 align:start position:0%
attorney
 
01:05:36.390 --> 01:05:36.400 align:start position:0%
general the Attorney General did not
 
01:05:39.390 --> 01:05:39.400 align:start position:0%
pursue these in any kind of Court
 
01:05:42.190 --> 01:05:42.200 align:start position:0%
proceeding I asked the Attorney General
 
01:05:45.950 --> 01:05:45.960 align:start position:0%
why and it's very simple New Hampshire
 
01:05:49.510 --> 01:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
election laws do not have attached
 
01:05:52.990 --> 01:05:53.000 align:start position:0%
penalties so we say put all the put all
 
01:05:55.670 --> 01:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
the ballots in a box seal it with tamper
 
01:05:58.789 --> 01:05:58.799 align:start position:0%
evident tape and if the box shows up
 
01:06:01.630 --> 01:06:01.640 align:start position:0%
tamper evident tape's clearly been uh
 
01:06:04.069 --> 01:06:04.079 align:start position:0%
dislodged the signatures across that are
 
01:06:07.069 --> 01:06:07.079 align:start position:0%
are missing um the boxes are still
 
01:06:09.549 --> 01:06:09.559 align:start position:0%
accepted in a Recon procedure even
 
01:06:12.910 --> 01:06:12.920 align:start position:0%
though there you have no idea if they've
 
01:06:15.589 --> 01:06:15.599 align:start position:0%
been opened or tampered with and
 
01:06:19.109 --> 01:06:19.119 align:start position:0%
evidence shows that so that's a just one
 
01:06:23.150 --> 01:06:23.160 align:start position:0%
of many many many uh uh violations that
 
01:06:25.589 --> 01:06:25.599 align:start position:0%
we've seen here that that that they
 
01:06:28.230 --> 01:06:28.240 align:start position:0%
reported and are they're summarized in
 
01:06:31.390 --> 01:06:31.400 align:start position:0%
those smaller books uh and a and a
 
01:06:34.430 --> 01:06:34.440 align:start position:0%
larger book lists every single violation
 
01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:36.269 align:start position:0%
larger book lists every single violation
that

01:06:36.269 --> 01:06:36.279 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:06:40.230 --> 01:06:40.240 align:start position:0%
occurred so you ask why do I raise this
 
01:06:44.390 --> 01:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
issue it's because I've spoken to many
 
01:06:47.269 --> 01:06:47.279 align:start position:0%
members of the legislature on Election
 
01:06:50.069 --> 01:06:50.079 align:start position:0%
Committee in in the past election law in
 
01:06:53.710 --> 01:06:53.720 align:start position:0%
the past and they say well the number of
 
01:06:56.549 --> 01:06:56.559 align:start position:0%
violations we have are minor they're not
 
01:06:59.150 --> 01:06:59.160 align:start position:0%
that many they're infrequent we don't
 
01:07:00.589 --> 01:07:00.599 align:start position:0%
need to deal with
 
01:07:05.190 --> 01:07:05.200 align:start position:0%
that I think this particular episode
 
01:07:08.390 --> 01:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
demonstrates the falsity of that
 
01:07:12.309 --> 01:07:12.319 align:start position:0%
assertion we have many many of these
 
01:07:15.109 --> 01:07:15.119 align:start position:0%
kinds of problems and it calls out and
 
01:07:17.789 --> 01:07:17.799 align:start position:0%
and the documentation submitted to the
 
01:07:22.029 --> 01:07:22.039 align:start position:0%
ballot law commission basically asks
 
01:07:26.109 --> 01:07:26.119 align:start position:0%
that three issues be addressed
 
01:07:28.789 --> 01:07:28.799 align:start position:0%
additional training for the people in
 
01:07:32.069 --> 01:07:32.079 align:start position:0%
the process of uh managing our
 
01:07:35.950 --> 01:07:35.960 align:start position:0%
elections further auditing of the
 
01:07:39.190 --> 01:07:39.200 align:start position:0%
process and finally attaching
 
01:07:42.829 --> 01:07:42.839 align:start position:0%
appropriate penalties to the violations
 
01:07:46.269 --> 01:07:46.279 align:start position:0%
that that are observed so when
 
01:07:48.910 --> 01:07:48.920 align:start position:0%
violations occur and they can be
 
01:07:50.910 --> 01:07:50.920 align:start position:0%
referred to the attorney general or the
 
01:07:53.269 --> 01:07:53.279 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State whatever office you
 
01:07:55.670 --> 01:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
believe is appropriate for uh for
 
01:07:57.990 --> 01:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
addressing them they can take
 
01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.589 align:start position:0%
addressing them they can take
appropriate

01:07:59.589 --> 01:07:59.599 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
01:08:04.309 --> 01:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
action what we have here is a A system
 
01:08:09.069 --> 01:08:09.079 align:start position:0%
that continually causes concern by
 
01:08:11.349 --> 01:08:11.359 align:start position:0%
individuals in the public
 
01:08:14.230 --> 01:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
saying is my vote really being counted
 
01:08:16.829 --> 01:08:16.839 align:start position:0%
when I see all these violations is my
 
01:08:19.229 --> 01:08:19.239 align:start position:0%
vote being tampered with when I see all
 
01:08:22.430 --> 01:08:22.440 align:start position:0%
these violations and nothing
 
01:08:28.430 --> 01:08:28.440 align:start position:0%
happens so this committee I I would
 
01:08:30.349 --> 01:08:30.359 align:start position:0%
actually prefer you look at all of
 
01:08:32.829 --> 01:08:32.839 align:start position:0%
election law and deal with training
 
01:08:36.789 --> 01:08:36.799 align:start position:0%
auditing and uh penalties but in order
 
01:08:39.709 --> 01:08:39.719 align:start position:0%
to put a stake in the ground that this
 
01:08:44.430 --> 01:08:44.440 align:start position:0%
is real I took this massive number of
 
01:08:46.590 --> 01:08:46.600 align:start position:0%
violations seen by the bout law
 
01:08:48.749 --> 01:08:48.759 align:start position:0%
commission validated by the bout law
 
01:08:50.430 --> 01:08:50.440 align:start position:0%
commission that these are real this is
 
01:08:53.829 --> 01:08:53.839 align:start position:0%
not fantasy um and and present that to
 
01:08:57.749 --> 01:08:57.759 align:start position:0%
you as a as a grounds for moving forward
 
01:08:59.669 --> 01:08:59.679 align:start position:0%
and happy to take any
 
01:09:02.309 --> 01:09:02.319 align:start position:0%
questions okay thank you do we have any
 
01:09:05.470 --> 01:09:05.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:08.510 --> 01:09:08.520 align:start position:0%
committee uh representative
 
01:09:11.470 --> 01:09:11.480 align:start position:0%
Ward I'm sorry representative wood
 
01:09:14.510 --> 01:09:14.520 align:start position:0%
that's fine thank you okay well did I
 
01:09:16.470 --> 01:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
jump ahead of you okay thank you for
 
01:09:19.470 --> 01:09:19.480 align:start position:0%
taking my question um it seems to me
 
01:09:21.510 --> 01:09:21.520 align:start position:0%
that bring you're bringing this forward
 
01:09:24.070 --> 01:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
to just uh continue the process of
 
01:09:25.789 --> 01:09:25.799 align:start position:0%
someone looking into this is that true
 
01:09:29.349 --> 01:09:29.359 align:start position:0%
or have we found uh any other problems
 
01:09:31.950 --> 01:09:31.960 align:start position:0%
to to why can I ask you why you bringing
 
01:09:34.870 --> 01:09:34.880 align:start position:0%
this forward at this point I I bring It
 
01:09:37.470 --> 01:09:37.480 align:start position:0%
Forward because it it's clear
 
01:09:39.669 --> 01:09:39.679 align:start position:0%
documentation of the kinds of problems
 
01:09:41.510 --> 01:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
that we've seen and I asked for a
 
01:09:46.149 --> 01:09:46.159 align:start position:0%
committee to study it to not you you
 
01:09:49.390 --> 01:09:49.400 align:start position:0%
can't undo what has been done but put
 
01:09:52.910 --> 01:09:52.920 align:start position:0%
together procedures that will limit
 
01:09:54.830 --> 01:09:54.840 align:start position:0%
these kinds of problems in the future
 
01:09:57.310 --> 01:09:57.320 align:start position:0%
and that that boils down to training of
 
01:09:58.790 --> 01:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
the people that are conducting the
 
01:10:01.830 --> 01:10:01.840 align:start position:0%
elections auditing to make sure that you
 
01:10:04.630 --> 01:10:04.640 align:start position:0%
really are implementing those training
 
01:10:06.669 --> 01:10:06.679 align:start position:0%
procedures and people are following the
 
01:10:10.950 --> 01:10:10.960 align:start position:0%
law as written and thirdly penalties
 
01:10:14.310 --> 01:10:14.320 align:start position:0%
that ascribed to the violations so that
 
01:10:15.870 --> 01:10:15.880 align:start position:0%
they're just not
 
01:10:18.149 --> 01:10:18.159 align:start position:0%
ignored and and that's the problem that
 
01:10:21.070 --> 01:10:21.080 align:start position:0%
we have we have you know you can you can
 
01:10:23.750 --> 01:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
look at these violations and say oh this
 
01:10:26.430 --> 01:10:26.440 align:start position:0%
is this is just a little minor thing but
 
01:10:30.390 --> 01:10:30.400 align:start position:0%
if this is repetitive and ubiquitous
 
01:10:32.270 --> 01:10:32.280 align:start position:0%
over and over and over again we see
 
01:10:34.470 --> 01:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
these problems you you have an
 
01:10:37.630 --> 01:10:37.640 align:start position:0%
electorate that's saying I don't trust
 
01:10:40.070 --> 01:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
the process and we do not want to be
 
01:10:43.950 --> 01:10:43.960 align:start position:0%
there so I want the committee to to to
 
01:10:47.550 --> 01:10:47.560 align:start position:0%
the committee to appro pass this uh Bill
 
01:10:51.390 --> 01:10:51.400 align:start position:0%
and establish a committee that will make
 
01:10:54.870 --> 01:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
recommendations to our our uh election
 
01:10:57.910 --> 01:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
law to change it to to address those
 
01:10:57.920 --> 01:10:59.270 align:start position:0%
law to change it to to address those
three

01:10:59.270 --> 01:10:59.280 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:11:01.669 --> 01:11:01.679 align:start position:0%
things okay thank
 
01:11:03.510 --> 01:11:03.520 align:start position:0%
you further
 
01:11:06.310 --> 01:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
questions representative

Ford thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:11:10.430 --> 01:11:10.440 align:start position:0%
for taking my question when you started
 
01:11:13.070 --> 01:11:13.080 align:start position:0%
out your testimony you spoke of 700
 
01:11:15.910 --> 01:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
hours of lay volunteer work yes you
 
01:11:18.950 --> 01:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
characterize was that a group yes there
 
01:11:20.910 --> 01:11:20.920 align:start position:0%
were there were several individuals
 
01:11:24.830 --> 01:11:24.840 align:start position:0%
involved in the uh uh election area of
 
01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:26.110 align:start position:0%
involved in the uh uh election area of
District

01:11:26.110 --> 01:11:26.120 align:start position:0%
District
 
01:11:29.270 --> 01:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
24 from the different towns in in that
 
01:11:31.470 --> 01:11:31.480 align:start position:0%
area and they collectively looked at
 
01:11:34.709 --> 01:11:34.719 align:start position:0%
what happened in their respective towns
 
01:11:39.270 --> 01:11:39.280 align:start position:0%
uh and and um scoured through you know
 
01:11:43.110 --> 01:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
what happened during that election and
 
01:11:44.990 --> 01:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
compiled their
 
01:11:46.790 --> 01:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
observations which were then brought
 
01:11:48.750 --> 01:11:48.760 align:start position:0%
before the bout law
 
01:11:52.189 --> 01:11:52.199 align:start position:0%
commission so not an organized group
 
01:11:54.950 --> 01:11:54.960 align:start position:0%
it's not a defined entity no it was it
 
01:11:58.390 --> 01:11:58.400 align:start position:0%
was these are uh willing citizens
 
01:12:00.709 --> 01:12:00.719 align:start position:0%
looking at what's going on and and
 
01:12:03.550 --> 01:12:03.560 align:start position:0%
concerned with the election process
 
01:12:05.629 --> 01:12:05.639 align:start position:0%

thank you further questions uh

representative prome O'Brien I have a
 
01:12:13.629 --> 01:12:13.639 align:start position:0%
lot of questions I'm trying to organize
 
01:12:17.910 --> 01:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
them could you remind us who the
 
01:12:21.990 --> 01:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
candidates were and 2022 I did look up
 
01:12:24.270 --> 01:12:24.280 align:start position:0%
some uh information about that district
 
01:12:26.830 --> 01:12:26.840 align:start position:0%
and I see that as pretty evenly split
 
01:12:30.070 --> 01:12:30.080 align:start position:0%
Republican Democrat demographically but
 
01:12:31.790 --> 01:12:31.800 align:start position:0%
who are those candidates that year in
 
01:12:35.590 --> 01:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
2022 for Senate that was Lugar julo as a
 
01:12:39.070 --> 01:12:39.080 align:start position:0%
republican candidate and uh Al Chiller
 
01:12:41.110 --> 01:12:41.120 align:start position:0%
as the uh Democratic
 
01:12:45.310 --> 01:12:45.320 align:start position:0%
candidate uh the district is uh tends to
 
01:12:48.990 --> 01:12:49.000 align:start position:0%
be uh more it's not evenly split it's
 
01:12:50.629 --> 01:12:50.639 align:start position:0%
it's more of a democratic District
 
01:12:54.350 --> 01:12:54.360 align:start position:0%
because of the town of exitor which is
 
01:12:57.910 --> 01:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
very strongly Democratic okay you should
 
01:13:00.310 --> 01:13:00.320 align:start position:0%
like a followup yes I I have a
 
01:13:03.189 --> 01:13:03.199 align:start position:0%
followup I'm just thinking back to
 
01:13:05.750 --> 01:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
some difficulties that I also
 
01:13:07.550 --> 01:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
experienced in my own Community
 
01:13:11.310 --> 01:13:11.320 align:start position:0%
regarding similar issues and a Senate
 
01:13:12.990 --> 01:13:13.000 align:start position:0%
District is of course much different
 
01:13:14.470 --> 01:13:14.480 align:start position:0%
you've got many communities that you're
 
01:13:18.430 --> 01:13:18.440 align:start position:0%
working with did people in those
 
01:13:22.070 --> 01:13:22.080 align:start position:0%
communities come forward and
 
01:13:27.310 --> 01:13:27.320 align:start position:0%
make um reports about specific election
 
01:13:30.910 --> 01:13:30.920 align:start position:0%
law violations within their Community to
 
01:13:33.470 --> 01:13:33.480 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State and the Attorney
 
01:13:38.070 --> 01:13:38.080 align:start position:0%
General's office in an effort to um to
 
01:13:41.189 --> 01:13:41.199 align:start position:0%
fix that problem and that's what I
 
01:13:43.350 --> 01:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
recall having been done in my own
 
01:13:46.110 --> 01:13:46.120 align:start position:0%
Community there were reports to the
 
01:13:49.270 --> 01:13:49.280 align:start position:0%
secret State office by the members of
 
01:13:52.709 --> 01:13:52.719 align:start position:0%
individual communities but then the work
 
01:13:55.470 --> 01:13:55.480 align:start position:0%
was done to consolidate every everything
 
01:13:57.390 --> 01:13:57.400 align:start position:0%
that happened in all the communities
 
01:13:58.910 --> 01:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
involved in District
 
01:14:04.030 --> 01:14:04.040 align:start position:0%
24 to create this Consolidated list of
 
01:14:06.350 --> 01:14:06.360 align:start position:0%
you know we have these problems here and
 
01:14:07.870 --> 01:14:07.880 align:start position:0%
those problems there and let's put it
 
01:14:11.790 --> 01:14:11.800 align:start position:0%
all on one one big report and let's
 
01:14:13.990 --> 01:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
bring this to the ballot law commission
 
01:14:16.470 --> 01:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
and that went to the attorney general I
 
01:14:18.350 --> 01:14:18.360 align:start position:0%
do not know if any
 
01:14:20.870 --> 01:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
individuals uh went directly from their
 
01:14:23.550 --> 01:14:23.560 align:start position:0%
Community to the AG's office I don't I
 
01:14:25.550 --> 01:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
don't think that happened but it may
 
01:14:27.950 --> 01:14:27.960 align:start position:0%
have uh represent uh excuse me Al
 
01:14:31.669 --> 01:14:31.679 align:start position:0%
brandano behind me uh could probably
 
01:14:36.669 --> 01:14:36.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:40.110 --> 01:14:40.120 align:start position:0%
question representative wood thank thank
 
01:14:43.550 --> 01:14:43.560 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um regarding the action of
 
01:14:46.310 --> 01:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
the commission what was their action I I
 
01:14:47.390 --> 01:14:47.400 align:start position:0%
know you mentioned I just want to make
 
01:14:49.229 --> 01:14:49.239 align:start position:0%
sure I'm clear what was their action
 
01:14:50.830 --> 01:14:50.840 align:start position:0%
what was their recommendation out of
 
01:14:54.229 --> 01:14:54.239 align:start position:0%
this their recommendation was that these
 
01:14:54.239 --> 01:14:55.550 align:start position:0%
this their recommendation was that these
were

01:14:55.550 --> 01:14:55.560 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:14:58.510 --> 01:14:58.520 align:start position:0%
legitimate findings and that they
 
01:15:01.270 --> 01:15:01.280 align:start position:0%
couldn't take action on them so they
 
01:15:03.590 --> 01:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
referred because they they considered
 
01:15:06.629 --> 01:15:06.639 align:start position:0%
them violations of the law they referred
 
01:15:09.669 --> 01:15:09.679 align:start position:0%
them to the attorney general for his
 
01:15:12.030 --> 01:15:12.040 align:start position:0%
action I thank you that was very clear
 
01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:12.910 align:start position:0%
action I thank you that was very clear
thank

you representative
 
01:15:18.510 --> 01:15:18.520 align:start position:0%
Mirad thank you um I wonder if you could
 
01:15:21.470 --> 01:15:21.480 align:start position:0%
help me with the phrase the April 25th
 
01:15:24.149 --> 01:15:24.159 align:start position:0%
2023 ballot law commission and what that
 
01:15:26.229 --> 01:15:26.239 align:start position:0%
refers to when I look at the ballot law
 
01:15:27.910 --> 01:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
commission page on the Secretary of
 
01:15:30.229 --> 01:15:30.239 align:start position:0%
State's website I see meetings that were
 
01:15:33.270 --> 01:15:33.280 align:start position:0%
held on April 5th and 2023 and a meeting
 
01:15:35.470 --> 01:15:35.480 align:start position:0%
that's held on May 25th 2023 but not a
 
01:15:37.709 --> 01:15:37.719 align:start position:0%
meeting that was held on April 25th 2023
 
01:15:40.950 --> 01:15:40.960 align:start position:0%
no it's a April 5th is the right did I
 
01:15:44.950 --> 01:15:44.960 align:start position:0%
say 25th if I did April 25th Mr chair
 
01:15:47.310 --> 01:15:47.320 align:start position:0%
that uh that's what it says in the title
 
01:15:49.350 --> 01:15:49.360 align:start position:0%
of the bill April 25th that's that's a
 
01:15:52.070 --> 01:15:52.080 align:start position:0%
typo it's the 5th of
 
01:15:55.470 --> 01:15:55.480 align:start position:0%
April in fact the the document should
 
01:15:59.430 --> 01:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
say that that you have okay thank you
 
01:16:01.870 --> 01:16:01.880 align:start position:0%
followup may I ask whether the minutes
 
01:16:06.510 --> 01:16:06.520 align:start position:0%
of the April fifth meeting will have a a
 
01:16:08.430 --> 01:16:08.440 align:start position:0%
discussion of these violations certainly
 
01:16:12.229 --> 01:16:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:16.149 --> 01:16:16.159 align:start position:0%
yes okay uh representative
 
01:16:18.669 --> 01:16:18.679 align:start position:0%
warry thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:16:20.430 --> 01:16:20.440 align:start position:0%
represent for taking my question just
 
01:16:22.870 --> 01:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
want to clarify you've mentioned uh the
 
01:16:25.629 --> 01:16:25.639 align:start position:0%
three aspects I I saw the ballot law
 
01:16:27.669 --> 01:16:27.679 align:start position:0%
commission presentation and I'm familiar
 
01:16:30.229 --> 01:16:30.239 align:start position:0%
with it so thank you uh for bringing
 
01:16:32.590 --> 01:16:32.600 align:start position:0%
that up uh the you've mentioned training
 
01:16:34.790 --> 01:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
auditing and penalties however the scope
 
01:16:37.790 --> 01:16:37.800 align:start position:0%
of Duties on lines 10 and 11 seem to
 
01:16:41.669 --> 01:16:41.679 align:start position:0%
refer specifically to the Penalty aspect
 
01:16:46.390 --> 01:16:46.400 align:start position:0%
um so is is it your desire to have both
 
01:16:51.350 --> 01:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:53.629 --> 01:16:53.639 align:start position:0%
penalties if you look at the
 
01:16:57.550 --> 01:16:57.560 align:start position:0%
recommendation in the actual uh
 
01:16:59.830 --> 01:16:59.840 align:start position:0%
documentation presented to the bout law
 
01:17:02.189 --> 01:17:02.199 align:start position:0%
commission those are the three areas
 
01:17:05.270 --> 01:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
that they call out I agree with them
 
01:17:07.189 --> 01:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
when the when this bill was written it
 
01:17:09.790 --> 01:17:09.800 align:start position:0%
was just it focused in on the penalties
 
01:17:12.390 --> 01:17:12.400 align:start position:0%
because if you if you don't have a
 
01:17:15.669 --> 01:17:15.679 align:start position:0%
penalty for the for for breaking the
 
01:17:17.950 --> 01:17:17.960 align:start position:0%
rules you're never going to get anywhere
 
01:17:19.310 --> 01:17:19.320 align:start position:0%
it's the only way you're going to get
 
01:17:22.470 --> 01:17:22.480 align:start position:0%
attention of people who don't follow the
 
01:17:25.110 --> 01:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
rules now if you want to get better
 
01:17:26.709 --> 01:17:26.719 align:start position:0%
compliance you're going to train an
 
01:17:29.270 --> 01:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
audit as well that's only
 
01:17:31.470 --> 01:17:31.480 align:start position:0%
logical but but
 
01:17:34.950 --> 01:17:34.960 align:start position:0%
ultimately the you're you're not going
 
01:17:40.709 --> 01:17:40.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:44.149 --> 01:17:44.159 align:start position:0%
penalty further questions from the
 
01:17:47.430 --> 01:17:47.440 align:start position:0%
committee representative Gilmore thank
 
01:17:50.750 --> 01:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
you do you have a listed these
 
01:17:54.070 --> 01:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
violations yes they they're they're in a
 
01:17:55.350 --> 01:17:55.360 align:start position:0%
a larger
 
01:17:58.550 --> 01:17:58.560 align:start position:0%
uh book with all I think there's 121
 
01:18:02.669 --> 01:18:02.679 align:start position:0%
total and uh Al brandano behind me has
 
01:18:05.070 --> 01:18:05.080 align:start position:0%
has that book does he have he's
 
01:18:07.669 --> 01:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
gonna that if if the committee wants to
 
01:18:09.149 --> 01:18:09.159 align:start position:0%
move forward with this so we can make
 
01:18:10.790 --> 01:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
copies of that and and have that
 
01:18:12.910 --> 01:18:12.920 align:start position:0%
available yes thank
 
01:18:16.390 --> 01:18:16.400 align:start position:0%

01:18:49.070 --> 01:18:49.080 align:start position:0%

scandin Secretary of State and I'd like
 
01:18:55.470 --> 01:18:55.480 align:start position:0%
to provide some information just to put
 
01:18:57.430 --> 01:18:57.440 align:start position:0%
this issue in perspective uh for the
 
01:18:59.149 --> 01:18:59.159 align:start position:0%
committee first of all what's going
 
01:19:01.310 --> 01:19:01.320 align:start position:0%
around the room are the minutes from the
 
01:19:03.550 --> 01:19:03.560 align:start position:0%
bow law commission meeting where they
 
01:19:06.270 --> 01:19:06.280 align:start position:0%
took this issue up and then the second
 
01:19:07.990 --> 01:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
document is the response from the
 
01:19:09.990 --> 01:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
attorney from the Attorney General's
 
01:19:14.229 --> 01:19:14.239 align:start position:0%
office uh after receiving the uh the
 
01:19:17.910 --> 01:19:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:21.510 --> 01:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
Commission in terms of elections in New
 
01:19:24.070 --> 01:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the process that has developed
 
01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:25.430 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the process that has developed
over

01:19:25.430 --> 01:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
over
 
01:19:27.910 --> 01:19:27.920 align:start position:0%
over a couple centuries is both a
 
01:19:31.070 --> 01:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
blessing and a curse it's a blessing
 
01:19:33.910 --> 01:19:33.920 align:start position:0%
because uh the elections are run by We
 
01:19:36.830 --> 01:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
the People citizens from every one of
 
01:19:39.430 --> 01:19:39.440 align:start position:0%
your communities are elected by their
 
01:19:42.510 --> 01:19:42.520 align:start position:0%
neighbors friends family members uh and
 
01:19:44.709 --> 01:19:44.719 align:start position:0%
general community members to do these
 
01:19:47.950 --> 01:19:47.960 align:start position:0%
jobs um that are pretty important and
 
01:19:50.270 --> 01:19:50.280 align:start position:0%
hopefully they get elected to do those
 
01:19:52.030 --> 01:19:52.040 align:start position:0%
jobs based on their
 
01:19:55.149 --> 01:19:55.159 align:start position:0%
integrity uh and and the ability in the
 
01:19:58.990 --> 01:19:59.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:02.229 --> 01:20:02.239 align:start position:0%
that the process itself has many checks
 
01:20:04.149 --> 01:20:04.159 align:start position:0%
and balances in it so that after the
 
01:20:06.669 --> 01:20:06.679 align:start position:0%
election is over if there's a close race
 
01:20:09.310 --> 01:20:09.320 align:start position:0%
or even a not so close race in the case
 
01:20:12.629 --> 01:20:12.639 align:start position:0%
of the Senate uh District 24 recount
 
01:20:15.149 --> 01:20:15.159 align:start position:0%
where the the uh the difference between
 
01:20:17.830 --> 01:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
winning and losing was over 3,000 votes
 
01:20:19.390 --> 01:20:19.400 align:start position:0%
There's an opportunity for a recount
 
01:20:22.110 --> 01:20:22.120 align:start position:0%
where the ballots can be reviewed and
 
01:20:25.990 --> 01:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
challenged further um and if there are
 
01:20:28.950 --> 01:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
ballots that have been challenged for
 
01:20:31.070 --> 01:20:31.080 align:start position:0%
further appeal that might make the
 
01:20:32.550 --> 01:20:32.560 align:start position:0%
difference in the outcome of the
 
01:20:34.750 --> 01:20:34.760 align:start position:0%
election uh that issue can be taken to
 
01:20:37.189 --> 01:20:37.199 align:start position:0%
the bout law commission who will make an
 
01:20:40.189 --> 01:20:40.199 align:start position:0%
additional ruling on whether the intent
 
01:20:41.910 --> 01:20:41.920 align:start position:0%
of the voter on those ballots was
 
01:20:45.110 --> 01:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
accurately recorded or not and then
 
01:20:47.750 --> 01:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
ultimately issues can be taken to our
 
01:20:50.990 --> 01:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
state court system for you know
 
01:20:56.830 --> 01:20:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:59.550 --> 01:20:59.560 align:start position:0%
because the citizens run the elections
 
01:21:02.709 --> 01:21:02.719 align:start position:0%
in this state they are not perfect and
 
01:21:05.070 --> 01:21:05.080 align:start position:0%
they never will be perfect even though
 
01:21:07.430 --> 01:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
that's what we strive for there's just a
 
01:21:10.669 --> 01:21:10.679 align:start position:0%
human element of this that is is
 
01:21:12.550 --> 01:21:12.560 align:start position:0%
prevalent you know I would I would
 
01:21:15.310 --> 01:21:15.320 align:start position:0%
compare it to a classroom where you know
 
01:21:16.910 --> 01:21:16.920 align:start position:0%
you have some students that are going to
 
01:21:19.270 --> 01:21:19.280 align:start position:0%
get all A's all the time you know you
 
01:21:21.390 --> 01:21:21.400 align:start position:0%
don't have to worry about mistakes on
 
01:21:23.990 --> 01:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
their you know on their tests uh and
 
01:21:25.750 --> 01:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
then you proba have the larger bulk of
 
01:21:27.350 --> 01:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
students that are going to be in the B
 
01:21:30.189 --> 01:21:30.199 align:start position:0%
C+ range where they're not perfect all
 
01:21:31.669 --> 01:21:31.679 align:start position:0%
the time but you know they know enough
 
01:21:34.350 --> 01:21:34.360 align:start position:0%
to get the job done and then they going
 
01:21:36.590 --> 01:21:36.600 align:start position:0%
to be people in the class that simply
 
01:21:39.590 --> 01:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
are going to fail and the election
 
01:21:41.709 --> 01:21:41.719 align:start position:0%
process that we have really is no
 
01:21:45.430 --> 01:21:45.440 align:start position:0%
different because of collectively you
 
01:21:47.990 --> 01:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
know we're we're dealing with a
 
01:21:50.870 --> 01:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
representation of society as a whole and
 
01:21:52.750 --> 01:21:52.760 align:start position:0%
we don't have all a students that are
 
01:21:55.430 --> 01:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
running our elections uh that are going
 
01:21:58.189 --> 01:21:58.199 align:start position:0%
to be perfect every time and I think the
 
01:22:01.310 --> 01:22:01.320 align:start position:0%
report that you have seen is is
 
01:22:05.070 --> 01:22:05.080 align:start position:0%
expecting that and um I don't think that
 
01:22:08.390 --> 01:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
that is particularly realistic now we do
 
01:22:10.270 --> 01:22:10.280 align:start position:0%
have laws on the books and the laws have
 
01:22:13.149 --> 01:22:13.159 align:start position:0%
to be followed and to help the local
 
01:22:16.270 --> 01:22:16.280 align:start position:0%
election officials do their jobs as
 
01:22:20.229 --> 01:22:20.239 align:start position:0%
accurately and efficiently as possible
 
01:22:22.310 --> 01:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
uh we do a significant amount of
 
01:22:24.830 --> 01:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
training and that training process is
 
01:22:30.870 --> 01:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
growing all the time um I just when I uh
 
01:22:32.189 --> 01:22:32.199 align:start position:0%
when I first started working in the
 
01:22:34.510 --> 01:22:34.520 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office it was in
 
01:22:37.709 --> 01:22:37.719 align:start position:0%
the year 2002 so I've been at this for
 
01:22:41.229 --> 01:22:41.239 align:start position:0%
quite some time and I can tell you that
 
01:22:43.270 --> 01:22:43.280 align:start position:0%
when I started working in the
 
01:22:45.709 --> 01:22:45.719 align:start position:0%
office and this is part of putting this
 
01:22:47.030 --> 01:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
whole thing in
 
01:22:50.149 --> 01:22:50.159 align:start position:0%
perspective there was nothing uniform
 
01:22:52.189 --> 01:22:52.199 align:start position:0%
about the processes that were taking
 
01:22:55.070 --> 01:22:55.080 align:start position:0%
place in polling places around the St
 
01:22:58.629 --> 01:22:58.639 align:start position:0%
State this was the set of statutes that
 
01:23:03.830 --> 01:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
we had in the 1998 99 session and
 
01:23:05.950 --> 01:23:05.960 align:start position:0%
compared to the statutes that we have
 
01:23:08.790 --> 01:23:08.800 align:start position:0%
today and you can see this the today's
 
01:23:11.310 --> 01:23:11.320 align:start position:0%
book is about twice the size of the book
 
01:23:13.830 --> 01:23:13.840 align:start position:0%
25 years
 
01:23:17.229 --> 01:23:17.239 align:start position:0%
ago this was the election procedure
 
01:23:20.070 --> 01:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
manual in
 
01:23:22.390 --> 01:23:22.400 align:start position:0%
1989 this is the election procedure
 
01:23:24.790 --> 01:23:24.800 align:start position:0%
manual today
 
01:23:27.990 --> 01:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
and when I went around to polling places
 
01:23:31.110 --> 01:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
uh when I was first serving as deputy
 
01:23:34.950 --> 01:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
secretary of state we would walk in
 
01:23:37.550 --> 01:23:37.560 align:start position:0%
and the processes that were taking place
 
01:23:40.149 --> 01:23:40.159 align:start position:0%
were clearly not consistent with what
 
01:23:43.350 --> 01:23:43.360 align:start position:0%
the statutes uh required that they be
 
01:23:45.510 --> 01:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
and when we would inquire with the local
 
01:23:47.629 --> 01:23:47.639 align:start position:0%
election officials about how that
 
01:23:50.990 --> 01:23:51.000 align:start position:0%
process is working they said well we
 
01:23:52.470 --> 01:23:52.480 align:start position:0%
never looked at the law that's just the
 
01:23:58.110 --> 01:23:58.120 align:start position:0%
way we've always done it and and so um
 
01:24:00.910 --> 01:24:00.920 align:start position:0%
we've come a long way in 25 years uh
 
01:24:02.590 --> 01:24:02.600 align:start position:0%
during that time there was the passage
 
01:24:05.229 --> 01:24:05.239 align:start position:0%
of the help America vote act it required
 
01:24:07.030 --> 01:24:07.040 align:start position:0%
that we have a centralized Statewide
 
01:24:10.510 --> 01:24:10.520 align:start position:0%
voter database uh which we just replaced
 
01:24:13.350 --> 01:24:13.360 align:start position:0%
now with a brand new system but up until
 
01:24:15.669 --> 01:24:15.679 align:start position:0%
we created that in around
 
01:24:15.679 --> 01:24:17.669 align:start position:0%
we created that in around
2006

01:24:17.669 --> 01:24:17.679 align:start position:0%
2006
 
01:24:20.110 --> 01:24:20.120 align:start position:0%
every every municipality in New
 
01:24:23.189 --> 01:24:23.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire maintain their checklist in
 
01:24:25.030 --> 01:24:25.040 align:start position:0%
their own way
 
01:24:27.030 --> 01:24:27.040 align:start position:0%
and that ranged from really nice
 
01:24:29.629 --> 01:24:29.639 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets in the major cities in New
 
01:24:33.430 --> 01:24:33.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to hand recorded checklists in
 
01:24:35.990 --> 01:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
the small towns like orange where after
 
01:24:38.149 --> 01:24:38.159 align:start position:0%
every election they would hand write out
 
01:24:40.590 --> 01:24:40.600 align:start position:0%
a brand new checklist and that's how
 
01:24:43.070 --> 01:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
they were maintained so you know we've
 
01:24:45.109 --> 01:24:45.119 align:start position:0%
Consolidated uh we had to aggregated all
 
01:24:46.990 --> 01:24:47.000 align:start position:0%
of that information all of that data we
 
01:24:49.390 --> 01:24:49.400 align:start position:0%
had to put it in a uniform format get it
 
01:24:51.590 --> 01:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
into the database so it could be
 
01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:52.990 align:start position:0%
into the database so it could be
properly

01:24:52.990 --> 01:24:53.000 align:start position:0%
properly
 
01:24:56.070 --> 01:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
used the
 
01:24:57.910 --> 01:24:57.920 align:start position:0%
the training that we put on now as I
 
01:25:00.430 --> 01:25:00.440 align:start position:0%
mentioned before is very extensive we do
 
01:25:04.709 --> 01:25:04.719 align:start position:0%
it both in person uh and online and
 
01:25:08.270 --> 01:25:08.280 align:start position:0%
there are dozens of opportunities every
 
01:25:11.070 --> 01:25:11.080 align:start position:0%
year for local election officials to get
 
01:25:15.870 --> 01:25:15.880 align:start position:0%
trained on the proper procedures and uh
 
01:25:18.669 --> 01:25:18.679 align:start position:0%
uh processes that should take place in a
 
01:25:21.149 --> 01:25:21.159 align:start position:0%
polling place and we are seeing
 
01:25:23.550 --> 01:25:23.560 align:start position:0%
Improvement but you that's going to be
 
01:25:26.750 --> 01:25:26.760 align:start position:0%
an ongoing job up we're talking about
 
01:25:29.790 --> 01:25:29.800 align:start position:0%
probably close to 3,000 election
 
01:25:32.790 --> 01:25:32.800 align:start position:0%
officials that are you know assign these
 
01:25:35.030 --> 01:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
duties not volunteers that help on the
 
01:25:37.510 --> 01:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
election day but actual officials that
 
01:25:40.310 --> 01:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
are involved in this process and as you
 
01:25:43.629 --> 01:25:43.639 align:start position:0%
can imagine there was constant turnover
 
01:25:46.830 --> 01:25:46.840 align:start position:0%
uh in those numbers uh after every local
 
01:25:51.149 --> 01:25:51.159 align:start position:0%
election and so the training is ongoing
 
01:25:53.229 --> 01:25:53.239 align:start position:0%
and it is always from
 
01:25:57.189 --> 01:25:57.199 align:start position:0%
scratch two more uh
 
01:26:00.830 --> 01:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
um more involved uh processes in the
 
01:26:04.229 --> 01:26:04.239 align:start position:0%
polling place and so along with that
 
01:26:05.750 --> 01:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
there are varying degrees of ability
 
01:26:08.109 --> 01:26:08.119 align:start position:0%
brand new people that have no idea about
 
01:26:11.669 --> 01:26:11.679 align:start position:0%
the total text that is in this document
 
01:26:13.870 --> 01:26:13.880 align:start position:0%
versus some longers that have been
 
01:26:15.709 --> 01:26:15.719 align:start position:0%
around a while and they know how to do
 
01:26:21.950 --> 01:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
things uh properly so you know I am uh I
 
01:26:24.070 --> 01:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
I am sensitive to the issues that have
 
01:26:27.629 --> 01:26:27.639 align:start position:0%
been raised I don't think that that they
 
01:26:31.629 --> 01:26:31.639 align:start position:0%
raised to the level of of the Integrity
 
01:26:34.390 --> 01:26:34.400 align:start position:0%
of the election itself being jeopardized
 
01:26:37.109 --> 01:26:37.119 align:start position:0%
I think if the people on my staff at a
 
01:26:39.629 --> 01:26:39.639 align:start position:0%
recount were visiting polling places
 
01:26:42.590 --> 01:26:42.600 align:start position:0%
noticed ballot boxes or things that were
 
01:26:44.910 --> 01:26:44.920 align:start position:0%
in a condition where they needed to be
 
01:26:47.590 --> 01:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
investigated uh we would do that without
 
01:26:50.229 --> 01:26:50.239 align:start position:0%
hesitation but I think for the most part
 
01:26:52.950 --> 01:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
the election officials uh that we have
 
01:26:55.109 --> 01:26:55.119 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire are dedicated ated uh
 
01:26:57.310 --> 01:26:57.320 align:start position:0%
they want to do a good job I think for
 
01:26:59.830 --> 01:26:59.840 align:start position:0%
the most part they do an excellent job
 
01:27:02.310 --> 01:27:02.320 align:start position:0%
and I would hate to see anything uh
 
01:27:05.510 --> 01:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
occur in the form of legislation that is
 
01:27:08.590 --> 01:27:08.600 align:start position:0%
punitive and this study committee is
 
01:27:11.510 --> 01:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
designed to look at being punitive when
 
01:27:13.830 --> 01:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
the mistakes that are made are uh
 
01:27:17.109 --> 01:27:17.119 align:start position:0%
technical clerical and certainly not
 
01:27:19.030 --> 01:27:19.040 align:start position:0%
intentional so with that I would be
 
01:27:20.870 --> 01:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
happy to answer questions the committee
 
01:27:23.510 --> 01:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
might have thank you Mr secretary do we
 
01:27:24.990 --> 01:27:25.000 align:start position:0%
have questions from the committee
 
01:27:27.270 --> 01:27:27.280 align:start position:0%
bearing in mind we're now a bit over
 
01:27:30.510 --> 01:27:30.520 align:start position:0%
schedule and if if we
 
01:27:32.669 --> 01:27:32.679 align:start position:0%
could I can't enforce this but if you
 
01:27:34.470 --> 01:27:34.480 align:start position:0%
could try to keep the questions to the
 
01:27:35.669 --> 01:27:35.679 align:start position:0%
subject of the
 
01:27:39.270 --> 01:27:39.280 align:start position:0%
legislation uh as discussed so
 
01:27:42.470 --> 01:27:42.480 align:start position:0%
far okay thank you representative wood
 
01:27:45.030 --> 01:27:45.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for T taking my question so it
 
01:27:49.430 --> 01:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
seems to me that the concern I don't
 
01:27:52.030 --> 01:27:52.040 align:start position:0%
want to put words to you out sorry what
 
01:27:54.709 --> 01:27:54.719 align:start position:0%
is your concern with this bill which
 
01:27:57.669 --> 01:27:57.679 align:start position:0%
side are you on I I I didn't get that
 
01:28:00.790 --> 01:28:00.800 align:start position:0%
from your explanation if you could help
 
01:28:03.030 --> 01:28:03.040 align:start position:0%
concern is I think it's good to be
 
01:28:05.590 --> 01:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
skeptical of the processes that we have
 
01:28:08.310 --> 01:28:08.320 align:start position:0%
and it's good to have oversight and and
 
01:28:09.830 --> 01:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
I've always said that the process needs
 
01:28:12.430 --> 01:28:12.440 align:start position:0%
to be completely transparent we as
 
01:28:14.870 --> 01:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
transparent as it can possibly be and I
 
01:28:16.950 --> 01:28:16.960 align:start position:0%
think the intent of this bill is
 
01:28:20.750 --> 01:28:20.760 align:start position:0%
certainly in line with that what what I
 
01:28:22.950 --> 01:28:22.960 align:start position:0%
would hate to see however
 
01:28:25.310 --> 01:28:25.320 align:start position:0%
is it in the bill if you look at it
 
01:28:29.550 --> 01:28:29.560 align:start position:0%
there's language to look at
 
01:28:32.750 --> 01:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
uh uh it was punitive you know to look
 
01:28:35.229 --> 01:28:35.239 align:start position:0%
at you know what the remedy would be for
 
01:28:38.550 --> 01:28:38.560 align:start position:0%
penalties um that would be applied and
 
01:28:41.109 --> 01:28:41.119 align:start position:0%
and I don't think that that if we do
 
01:28:42.669 --> 01:28:42.679 align:start position:0%
that we're going to discourage people
 
01:28:44.990 --> 01:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
from stepping forward to perform these
 
01:28:47.550 --> 01:28:47.560 align:start position:0%
roles because they're going to be
 
01:28:49.109 --> 01:28:49.119 align:start position:0%
concerned that if they make a technical
 
01:28:53.189 --> 01:28:53.199 align:start position:0%
error or just a simple mistake um that
 
01:28:55.550 --> 01:28:55.560 align:start position:0%
they may be penalized for it uh and
 
01:28:58.750 --> 01:28:58.760 align:start position:0%
guilty of a violation of Law and um I
 
01:29:00.350 --> 01:29:00.360 align:start position:0%
think the the important thing is to
 
01:29:01.870 --> 01:29:01.880 align:start position:0%
continue with
 
01:29:05.149 --> 01:29:05.159 align:start position:0%
education and and we're doing that um
 
01:29:07.109 --> 01:29:07.119 align:start position:0%
you know certainly that requires
 
01:29:09.629 --> 01:29:09.639 align:start position:0%
resources and if it's the Judgment of
 
01:29:10.950 --> 01:29:10.960 align:start position:0%
this Committee in the legislature that
 
01:29:12.990 --> 01:29:13.000 align:start position:0%
we need to do more then I think we need
 
01:29:16.950 --> 01:29:16.960 align:start position:0%
to be prepared to pay for it and um uh I
 
01:29:18.750 --> 01:29:18.760 align:start position:0%
think that answers the question yeah
 
01:29:20.750 --> 01:29:20.760 align:start position:0%
thank you that's perfectly clear thank
 
01:29:22.950 --> 01:29:22.960 align:start position:0%
you Mr seor other questions from the
 
01:29:22.960 --> 01:29:25.430 align:start position:0%
you Mr seor other questions from the
committee

01:29:25.430 --> 01:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:29:28.030 --> 01:29:28.040 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
01:29:31.350 --> 01:29:31.360 align:start position:0%
warry uh thank you Mr chair and thank
 
01:29:33.830 --> 01:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
you secretary for take my question here
 
01:29:36.709 --> 01:29:36.719 align:start position:0%
um just we we've had a couple of uh
 
01:29:38.470 --> 01:29:38.480 align:start position:0%
forensic audits of a particular
 
01:29:40.510 --> 01:29:40.520 align:start position:0%
community in the past where there's been
 
01:29:43.350 --> 01:29:43.360 align:start position:0%
sort of redundant non-compliance how how
 
01:29:45.669 --> 01:29:45.679 align:start position:0%
would you advise handling those
 
01:29:47.629 --> 01:29:47.639 align:start position:0%
situations and what did the Secretary of
 
01:29:49.030 --> 01:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
State's office and the Attorney
 
01:29:52.390 --> 01:29:52.400 align:start position:0%
General's office do in that particular
 
01:29:54.590 --> 01:29:54.600 align:start position:0%
circumstance for the longest time we
 
01:29:58.189 --> 01:29:58.199 align:start position:0%
never had to use monitors uh because of
 
01:30:00.709 --> 01:30:00.719 align:start position:0%
situations that occurred in polling
 
01:30:03.709 --> 01:30:03.719 align:start position:0%
places and more recently there have
 
01:30:05.910 --> 01:30:05.920 align:start position:0%
been situations that have been
 
01:30:05.920 --> 01:30:07.470 align:start position:0%
been situations that have been
identified

01:30:07.470 --> 01:30:07.480 align:start position:0%
identified
 
01:30:11.310 --> 01:30:11.320 align:start position:0%
as going Beyond just normal technical
 
01:30:15.669 --> 01:30:15.679 align:start position:0%
failures or uh you know errors but uh
 
01:30:17.830 --> 01:30:17.840 align:start position:0%
just actions of election officials that
 
01:30:21.510 --> 01:30:21.520 align:start position:0%
were not appropriation not appropriate
 
01:30:25.310 --> 01:30:25.320 align:start position:0%
and um and and inv violation of more
 
01:30:27.910 --> 01:30:27.920 align:start position:0%
significant parts of the election laws
 
01:30:30.669 --> 01:30:30.679 align:start position:0%
and when that occurs uh we're supposed
 
01:30:33.189 --> 01:30:33.199 align:start position:0%
to put monitors in the polling place and
 
01:30:35.590 --> 01:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
so over the last two or three election
 
01:30:38.390 --> 01:30:38.400 align:start position:0%
Cycles now you know we've had monitors
 
01:30:40.910 --> 01:30:40.920 align:start position:0%
probably in two maybe three polling
 
01:30:44.189 --> 01:30:44.199 align:start position:0%
places in a given election there is one
 
01:30:47.790 --> 01:30:47.800 align:start position:0%
town in particular that has had monitors
 
01:30:51.270 --> 01:30:51.280 align:start position:0%
now in repeated elections and and we're
 
01:30:51.280 --> 01:30:52.910 align:start position:0%
now in repeated elections and and we're
taking

01:30:52.910 --> 01:30:52.920 align:start position:0%
taking
 
01:30:55.870 --> 01:30:55.880 align:start position:0%
Progressive addal steps to try and deal
 
01:31:00.109 --> 01:31:00.119 align:start position:0%
with the issues there um ultimately the
 
01:31:02.709 --> 01:31:02.719 align:start position:0%
towns have have a responsibility in this
 
01:31:04.950 --> 01:31:04.960 align:start position:0%
too and the people that they elect to
 
01:31:08.229 --> 01:31:08.239 align:start position:0%
those positions have to be qualified and
 
01:31:09.870 --> 01:31:09.880 align:start position:0%
the members of the community the voters
 
01:31:12.350 --> 01:31:12.360 align:start position:0%
in that Community need to recognize when
 
01:31:15.430 --> 01:31:15.440 align:start position:0%
those jobs are not being properly
 
01:31:18.070 --> 01:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
executed and and make the required
 
01:31:20.910 --> 01:31:20.920 align:start position:0%
changes um I know that the the Attorney
 
01:31:23.109 --> 01:31:23.119 align:start position:0%
General's office is the enforcement arm
 
01:31:24.990 --> 01:31:25.000 align:start position:0%
of the election law
 
01:31:26.629 --> 01:31:26.639 align:start position:0%
they are the ones that will conduct any
 
01:31:29.430 --> 01:31:29.440 align:start position:0%
investigations and they will make uh
 
01:31:32.070 --> 01:31:32.080 align:start position:0%
decisions based on those
 
01:31:34.270 --> 01:31:34.280 align:start position:0%
investigations and uh there have been a
 
01:31:36.070 --> 01:31:36.080 align:start position:0%
couple of instances where election
 
01:31:38.750 --> 01:31:38.760 align:start position:0%
officials have been actually removed
 
01:31:42.470 --> 01:31:42.480 align:start position:0%
from office because of uh inappropriate
 
01:31:46.510 --> 01:31:46.520 align:start position:0%
activity to the tune of just mishandling
 
01:31:49.390 --> 01:31:49.400 align:start position:0%
individuals votes voters votes or trying
 
01:31:53.669 --> 01:31:53.679 align:start position:0%
to cover up flaws uh in their process so
 
01:31:56.629 --> 01:31:56.639 align:start position:0%
uh um you we continue to tighten tighten
 
01:32:00.390 --> 01:32:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:04.590 --> 01:32:04.600 align:start position:0%
too yes do you think
 
01:32:07.709 --> 01:32:07.719 align:start position:0%
in those extreme situations that you
 
01:32:10.709 --> 01:32:10.719 align:start position:0%
just described that punitive measures
 
01:32:12.149 --> 01:32:12.159 align:start position:0%
ought to be put in
 
01:32:15.030 --> 01:32:15.040 align:start position:0%
place yes and I think they are in place
 
01:32:16.990 --> 01:32:17.000 align:start position:0%
uh they the punitive measures were
 
01:32:21.629 --> 01:32:21.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:24.669 --> 01:32:24.679 align:start position:0%
office representative Gilmore
 
01:32:26.590 --> 01:32:26.600 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Dave we're just talking
 
01:32:30.109 --> 01:32:30.119 align:start position:0%
about basically this bill is just poting
 
01:32:33.270 --> 01:32:33.280 align:start position:0%
local elected officials not State
 
01:32:36.189 --> 01:32:36.199 align:start position:0%
personnel as I understand it would you
 
01:32:38.310 --> 01:32:38.320 align:start position:0%
agree with that I I think that's true
 
01:32:40.830 --> 01:32:40.840 align:start position:0%
you know I I think that all of us have
 
01:32:42.750 --> 01:32:42.760 align:start position:0%
to be accountable but we have to be
 
01:32:45.030 --> 01:32:45.040 align:start position:0%
accountable in the appropriate way but
 
01:32:47.229 --> 01:32:47.239 align:start position:0%
that was about law commission process
 
01:32:49.550 --> 01:32:49.560 align:start position:0%
and okay thank
 
01:32:52.669 --> 01:32:52.679 align:start position:0%
you further questions uh representative
 
01:32:57.070 --> 01:32:57.080 align:start position:0%
prudo mban thank you uh I don't want to
 
01:33:00.270 --> 01:33:00.280 align:start position:0%
minimize the problems that have been
 
01:33:03.030 --> 01:33:03.040 align:start position:0%
discussed in this proposed bill I think
 
01:33:06.950 --> 01:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
they are very important but I go back to
 
01:33:08.590 --> 01:33:08.600 align:start position:0%
some of what you're saying and how it
 
01:33:11.430 --> 01:33:11.440 align:start position:0%
applied in my own Community where I had
 
01:33:13.350 --> 01:33:13.360 align:start position:0%
some concerns about
 
01:33:16.629 --> 01:33:16.639 align:start position:0%
election uh some violations in election
 
01:33:21.189 --> 01:33:21.199 align:start position:0%
law and it didn't make much it didn't
 
01:33:25.109 --> 01:33:25.119 align:start position:0%
get a lot of traction let's say until
 
01:33:27.669 --> 01:33:27.679 align:start position:0%
the AG in your
 
01:33:31.070 --> 01:33:31.080 align:start position:0%
office after their investigation had uh
 
01:33:33.669 --> 01:33:33.679 align:start position:0%
a monitor sent to my community and that
 
01:33:33.679 --> 01:33:34.830 align:start position:0%
a monitor sent to my community and that
action

01:33:34.830 --> 01:33:34.840 align:start position:0%
action
 
01:33:37.189 --> 01:33:37.199 align:start position:0%
was kind of embarrassing and that got
 
01:33:39.310 --> 01:33:39.320 align:start position:0%
the attention of the public would you
 
01:33:42.669 --> 01:33:42.679 align:start position:0%
say that going through that process and
 
01:33:44.030 --> 01:33:44.040 align:start position:0%
things did improve in my community
 
01:33:45.510 --> 01:33:45.520 align:start position:0%
thankfully but would you say that going
 
01:33:48.149 --> 01:33:48.159 align:start position:0%
through that process is the best way to
 
01:33:50.270 --> 01:33:50.280 align:start position:0%
draw attention to it that's what I found
 
01:33:53.470 --> 01:33:53.480 align:start position:0%
in my community well I I think it is a
 
01:33:55.270 --> 01:33:55.280 align:start position:0%
good way to address it and as you
 
01:33:56.870 --> 01:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned it you know the community
 
01:33:59.030 --> 01:33:59.040 align:start position:0%
should be embarrassed if they have to
 
01:33:59.910 --> 01:33:59.920 align:start position:0%
have a
 
01:34:03.590 --> 01:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
monitor um there is a bit of an issue
 
01:34:06.550 --> 01:34:06.560 align:start position:0%
with the monitor process itself and that
 
01:34:08.470 --> 01:34:08.480 align:start position:0%
is finding individuals that are
 
01:34:11.750 --> 01:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
qualified to be monitors in a polling
 
01:34:14.189 --> 01:34:14.199 align:start position:0%
place on Election Day because the pool
 
01:34:15.510 --> 01:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
of people that would have that
 
01:34:18.790 --> 01:34:18.800 align:start position:0%
experience and expertise are serving as
 
01:34:22.550 --> 01:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
election officials during an election so
 
01:34:24.590 --> 01:34:24.600 align:start position:0%
we have uh
 
01:34:27.550 --> 01:34:27.560 align:start position:0%
you know we have used some elderly
 
01:34:29.669 --> 01:34:29.679 align:start position:0%
attorneys in the past that have had
 
01:34:32.550 --> 01:34:32.560 align:start position:0%
election experience and we've tried to
 
01:34:34.910 --> 01:34:34.920 align:start position:0%
use some young attorneys in my office
 
01:34:36.390 --> 01:34:36.400 align:start position:0%
you know trying to give them some
 
01:34:38.990 --> 01:34:39.000 align:start position:0%
exposure to these processes but they
 
01:34:41.030 --> 01:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
were on a sharp learning curve as well
 
01:34:44.390 --> 01:34:44.400 align:start position:0%
so um you know we continue to we
 
01:34:46.669 --> 01:34:46.679 align:start position:0%
continue to
 
01:34:51.070 --> 01:34:51.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:52.950 --> 01:34:52.960 align:start position:0%
evolve further questions from the
 
01:34:52.960 --> 01:34:54.149 align:start position:0%
evolve further questions from the
committee

01:34:54.149 --> 01:34:54.159 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:34:57.310 --> 01:34:57.320 align:start position:0%
if not uh I guess not well thank you
 
01:34:59.790 --> 01:34:59.800 align:start position:0%
very much Mr secretary always a pleasure
 
01:35:01.830 --> 01:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
to see you here always a pleasure to
 
01:35:06.950 --> 01:35:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:09.229 --> 01:35:09.239 align:start position:0%
brandano thank you thank you for being
 
01:35:09.239 --> 01:35:16.750 align:start position:0%
brandano thank you thank you for being
here

01:35:16.750 --> 01:35:16.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:19.270 --> 01:35:19.280 align:start position:0%
today thank you my name is Al brand Deno
 
01:35:22.350 --> 01:35:22.360 align:start position:0%
I'm from Kensington New Hampshire
 
01:35:24.990 --> 01:35:25.000 align:start position:0%
and I'm kind of disappointed because I
 
01:35:27.669 --> 01:35:27.679 align:start position:0%
look around me in the past last four
 
01:35:30.189 --> 01:35:30.199 align:start position:0%
years this room would be
 
01:35:33.109 --> 01:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
packed and that's not the case anymore
 
01:35:35.149 --> 01:35:35.159 align:start position:0%
because people have lost
 
01:35:37.430 --> 01:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
confidence because for the last four
 
01:35:40.270 --> 01:35:40.280 align:start position:0%
years when we came before this committee
 
01:35:42.950 --> 01:35:42.960 align:start position:0%
not many not not not a handful of the
 
01:35:44.830 --> 01:35:44.840 align:start position:0%
bills of the 40 things that we brought
 
01:35:48.950 --> 01:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
up for election integrity was addressed
 
01:35:53.030 --> 01:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
and and respectfully to um to secretary
 
01:35:55.229 --> 01:35:55.239 align:start position:0%
scanland he had a voter confidence
 
01:35:57.350 --> 01:35:57.360 align:start position:0%
committee where hundreds of people
 
01:35:59.030 --> 01:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
across the state
 
01:36:02.070 --> 01:36:02.080 align:start position:0%
attended ask him what happened with the
 
01:36:05.390 --> 01:36:05.400 align:start position:0%
results what actions have they taken so
 
01:36:08.070 --> 01:36:08.080 align:start position:0%
sadly this is where we're at and it's
 
01:36:10.750 --> 01:36:10.760 align:start position:0%
very frustrating but I'm here to do the
 
01:36:12.470 --> 01:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
best I can on behalf of the people who
 
01:36:13.550 --> 01:36:13.560 align:start position:0%
have given
 
01:36:17.870 --> 01:36:17.880 align:start position:0%
up first of all this this audit happened
 
01:36:21.790 --> 01:36:21.800 align:start position:0%
uh this citizen audit happened after the
 
01:36:24.189 --> 01:36:24.199 align:start position:0%
rec the recount election
 
01:36:27.750 --> 01:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
uh of of um senator who was running at
 
01:36:29.109 --> 01:36:29.119 align:start position:0%
the time L
 
01:36:32.870 --> 01:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
gulo about 50 people joined in on the
 
01:36:35.990 --> 01:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
recount on from L's Community there was
 
01:36:38.550 --> 01:36:38.560 align:start position:0%
seven towns 50 people came together on
 
01:36:40.550 --> 01:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
the recount that happened at the
 
01:36:43.550 --> 01:36:43.560 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's Archive Building
 
01:36:46.790 --> 01:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
during that process we became motiv not
 
01:36:49.149 --> 01:36:49.159 align:start position:0%
only motivated but horrified of what we
 
01:36:52.109 --> 01:36:52.119 align:start position:0%
witnessed from taped one of the big
 
01:36:53.870 --> 01:36:53.880 align:start position:0%
things in the contention for me in
 
01:36:56.350 --> 01:36:56.360 align:start position:0%
hearing secretary scandin is that he's
 
01:36:58.750 --> 01:36:58.760 align:start position:0%
missing a very important point and that
 
01:37:01.270 --> 01:37:01.280 align:start position:0%
is chain of custody chain of custody is
 
01:37:03.629 --> 01:37:03.639 align:start position:0%
broken you can't count anything in fact
 
01:37:05.550 --> 01:37:05.560 align:start position:0%
if chain of custody is broken it's all
 
01:37:07.629 --> 01:37:07.639 align:start position:0%
broken you can't say well the boxes were
 
01:37:10.070 --> 01:37:10.080 align:start position:0%
broken or we maped them or we use the
 
01:37:13.470 --> 01:37:13.480 align:start position:0%
wrong tape and it's unacceptable once
 
01:37:15.830 --> 01:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
the chain of custody the rest of this is
 
01:37:18.310 --> 01:37:18.320 align:start position:0%
incidental it really doesn't matter
 
01:37:19.830 --> 01:37:19.840 align:start position:0%
chain of custody is everything and we
 
01:37:22.750 --> 01:37:22.760 align:start position:0%
should be really focused on that and in
 
01:37:26.430 --> 01:37:26.440 align:start position:0%
the so after that process about eight
 
01:37:29.430 --> 01:37:29.440 align:start position:0%
people came together on Lou's behalf and
 
01:37:33.070 --> 01:37:33.080 align:start position:0%
went through about 800 hours of work and
 
01:37:34.750 --> 01:37:34.760 align:start position:0%
you'll find it here and I'll produce it
 
01:37:40.350 --> 01:37:40.360 align:start position:0%
for you every every uh complaint in this
 
01:37:42.350 --> 01:37:42.360 align:start position:0%
is been verified and we have the
 
01:37:45.830 --> 01:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
documentation with pictures and rsas
 
01:37:49.390 --> 01:37:49.400 align:start position:0%
laws not just infractions but rsas that
 
01:37:51.669 --> 01:37:51.679 align:start position:0%
have been violated you'll find that
 
01:37:53.709 --> 01:37:53.719 align:start position:0%
there's some towns like exitor over over
 
01:37:55.589 --> 01:37:55.599 align:start position:0%
and over and over they've been noticed
 
01:37:57.430 --> 01:37:57.440 align:start position:0%
by the attorney general and Secretary of
 
01:37:59.510 --> 01:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
State we can go on and on and I'll
 
01:38:01.870 --> 01:38:01.880 align:start position:0%
produce this for you but every thing
 
01:38:04.669 --> 01:38:04.679 align:start position:0%
that you find in here we have produced
 
01:38:07.870 --> 01:38:07.880 align:start position:0%
in paper form with as actual evidence of
 
01:38:11.149 --> 01:38:11.159 align:start position:0%
violations of rsas not just incidental
 
01:38:14.589 --> 01:38:14.599 align:start position:0%
things or policy procedures or failures
 
01:38:16.470 --> 01:38:16.480 align:start position:0%
so I want to make that
 
01:38:19.350 --> 01:38:19.360 align:start position:0%
clear um the second part here that
 
01:38:22.030 --> 01:38:22.040 align:start position:0%
really concerns me is that if if we
 
01:38:23.870 --> 01:38:23.880 align:start position:0%
don't do something and we can continue
 
01:38:25.589 --> 01:38:25.599 align:start position:0%
on the same path that we just say you
 
01:38:28.109 --> 01:38:28.119 align:start position:0%
know it's okay they minor infractions
 
01:38:30.669 --> 01:38:30.679 align:start position:0%
and nothing's going to happen doesn't
 
01:38:33.070 --> 01:38:33.080 align:start position:0%
matter what's what's going to happen
 
01:38:35.510 --> 01:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
where is where are we now like I said
 
01:38:37.430 --> 01:38:37.440 align:start position:0%
I'm one person here there used to be
 
01:38:39.510 --> 01:38:39.520 align:start position:0%
this place you remember it you were here
 
01:38:43.589 --> 01:38:43.599 align:start position:0%
it was packed nobody believes anybody
 
01:38:44.950 --> 01:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
when you take it to the community when
 
01:38:47.070 --> 01:38:47.080 align:start position:0%
you take it to the ballot law commission
 
01:38:48.990 --> 01:38:49.000 align:start position:0%
and they take send it to the attorney
 
01:38:50.950 --> 01:38:50.960 align:start position:0%
general and nothing they're not going to
 
01:38:52.750 --> 01:38:52.760 align:start position:0%
investigate because if you look at the
 
01:38:55.270 --> 01:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
Attorney General letter he says
 
01:38:57.669 --> 01:38:57.679 align:start position:0%
specifically it's not up to us you
 
01:39:00.629 --> 01:39:00.639 align:start position:0%
didn't point out the person if you look
 
01:39:03.430 --> 01:39:03.440 align:start position:0%
at what he said you didn't point out the
 
01:39:05.790 --> 01:39:05.800 align:start position:0%
person that you want to claim violated
 
01:39:09.510 --> 01:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
the law that's not that's not my duty
 
01:39:12.189 --> 01:39:12.199 align:start position:0%
we're citizens if we that would be
 
01:39:14.990 --> 01:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
Vigilantes and it's unfair to understand
 
01:39:18.709 --> 01:39:18.719 align:start position:0%
that that's what he said and in in my on
 
01:39:21.189 --> 01:39:21.199 align:start position:0%
you know non- lawyer language that's
 
01:39:23.589 --> 01:39:23.599 align:start position:0%
unacceptable the people came together
 
01:39:25.790 --> 01:39:25.800 align:start position:0%
did this work gave it to them and
 
01:39:28.189 --> 01:39:28.199 align:start position:0%
nothing happened and they told us you
 
01:39:30.950 --> 01:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
didn't identify the person who committed
 
01:39:33.470 --> 01:39:33.480 align:start position:0%
the crime well we just let you know that
 
01:39:35.830 --> 01:39:35.840 align:start position:0%
somebody was robbing the bank right
 
01:39:37.390 --> 01:39:37.400 align:start position:0%
that's all we don't know who it was we
 
01:39:39.030 --> 01:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
saw the car drive away but that's not
 
01:39:39.040 --> 01:39:39.910 align:start position:0%
saw the car drive away but that's not
our

01:39:39.910 --> 01:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:39:43.350 --> 01:39:43.360 align:start position:0%
job so you have to excuse my I hope my
 
01:39:45.910 --> 01:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
harshness and my passion but I'm really
 
01:39:48.950 --> 01:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
this a lot of work from a lot of people
 
01:39:51.589 --> 01:39:51.599 align:start position:0%
and they're and they're quitting because
 
01:39:53.990 --> 01:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
they see no hope and I only see the Hope
 
01:39:55.629 --> 01:39:55.639 align:start position:0%
in this committee that you will pass
 
01:39:58.350 --> 01:39:58.360 align:start position:0%
this bill no one's out to hurt anybody
 
01:40:00.510 --> 01:40:00.520 align:start position:0%
that's not doing anything habitual
 
01:40:02.629 --> 01:40:02.639 align:start position:0%
offenders need to be taken care of it
 
01:40:04.149 --> 01:40:04.159 align:start position:0%
can't continue like
 
01:40:07.310 --> 01:40:07.320 align:start position:0%
this I'll take any
 
01:40:09.430 --> 01:40:09.440 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much do we have
 
01:40:11.070 --> 01:40:11.080 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
01:40:14.430 --> 01:40:14.440 align:start position:0%
committee okay representative wood thank
 
01:40:17.430 --> 01:40:17.440 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:40:19.350 --> 01:40:19.360 align:start position:0%
question and off for the hard work
 
01:40:21.350 --> 01:40:21.360 align:start position:0%
you've been doing how do you see this
 
01:40:23.669 --> 01:40:23.679 align:start position:0%
bill helping um you said that you
 
01:40:25.310 --> 01:40:25.320 align:start position:0%
haven't seen any action how do you see
 
01:40:26.990 --> 01:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
this bill making a difference please
 
01:40:29.229 --> 01:40:29.239 align:start position:0%
because if you look past the last four
 
01:40:31.189 --> 01:40:31.199 align:start position:0%
years what's come out of this committee
 
01:40:33.149 --> 01:40:33.159 align:start position:0%
is really nothing for the only thing
 
01:40:35.109 --> 01:40:35.119 align:start position:0%
that's really come out that has actually
 
01:40:38.470 --> 01:40:38.480 align:start position:0%
hurt us I think is hp1 154 and I there's
 
01:40:42.149 --> 01:40:42.159 align:start position:0%
a whole that is a dis that was a a bill
 
01:40:43.950 --> 01:40:43.960 align:start position:0%
that was hidden within a health care
 
01:40:46.669 --> 01:40:46.679 align:start position:0%
bill which changed 22 election laws
 
01:40:49.310 --> 01:40:49.320 align:start position:0%
which frustrated so many people who come
 
01:40:51.109 --> 01:40:51.119 align:start position:0%
here every day and try to do the work of
 
01:40:54.229 --> 01:40:54.239 align:start position:0%
the citizen so what happens is this is a
 
01:40:56.470 --> 01:40:56.480 align:start position:0%
starting point for people to have hope
 
01:40:59.510 --> 01:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
hey all we're asking for is that there
 
01:41:02.589 --> 01:41:02.599 align:start position:0%
is a review of the rules we we because
 
01:41:04.750 --> 01:41:04.760 align:start position:0%
training let's be honest is not Vol it's
 
01:41:07.070 --> 01:41:07.080 align:start position:0%
only voluntary right I mean it's not
 
01:41:10.229 --> 01:41:10.239 align:start position:0%
mandatory I don't know I I believe the
 
01:41:12.589 --> 01:41:12.599 align:start position:0%
the the the training rates are less than
 
01:41:14.629 --> 01:41:14.639 align:start position:0%
50% I think the secretary of state will
 
01:41:16.790 --> 01:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
have to tell me of the people who
 
01:41:19.189 --> 01:41:19.199 align:start position:0%
participate so we have a a training
 
01:41:22.109 --> 01:41:22.119 align:start position:0%
issue as well um but there's a habitual
 
01:41:23.750 --> 01:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
offender issue
 
01:41:26.430 --> 01:41:26.440 align:start position:0%
and also a chain of custody we really
 
01:41:28.109 --> 01:41:28.119 align:start position:0%
need to crack down on the proper chain
 
01:41:29.709 --> 01:41:29.719 align:start position:0%
of custody because if you don't know
 
01:41:31.510 --> 01:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
what's in the boxes it doesn't matter
 
01:41:32.950 --> 01:41:32.960 align:start position:0%
what the count
 
01:41:34.910 --> 01:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
is thank
 
01:41:39.589 --> 01:41:39.599 align:start position:0%

of State uh I am a citizen and I make
 
01:42:15.270 --> 01:42:15.280 align:start position:0%
mistakes but my name is Diane fiser and
 
01:42:18.030 --> 01:42:18.040 align:start position:0%
I'm from Hamstead New Hampshire and I'm
 
01:42:20.270 --> 01:42:20.280 align:start position:0%
going to tell you a little story I came
 
01:42:23.350 --> 01:42:23.360 align:start position:0%
home from a trip a few days ago and I
 
01:42:27.149 --> 01:42:27.159 align:start position:0%
had no hot water the pipes had Frozen I
 
01:42:29.750 --> 01:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
called my son and asked him to come over
 
01:42:32.270 --> 01:42:32.280 align:start position:0%
and he used some kind of a heat lamp or
 
01:42:34.830 --> 01:42:34.840 align:start position:0%
whatever and got the water flowing and
 
01:42:36.669 --> 01:42:36.679 align:start position:0%
then we found it was fine and then we
 
01:42:38.109 --> 01:42:38.119 align:start position:0%
went through the house and we looked
 
01:42:40.229 --> 01:42:40.239 align:start position:0%
around at the pipes to determine whether
 
01:42:42.109 --> 01:42:42.119 align:start position:0%
or not there were any leaks or breaks
 
01:42:44.350 --> 01:42:44.360 align:start position:0%
and as he said we need to make sure of
 
01:42:47.589 --> 01:42:47.599 align:start position:0%
this before anything and more damage
 
01:42:49.790 --> 01:42:49.800 align:start position:0%
happens well I look at this this
 
01:42:52.109 --> 01:42:52.119 align:start position:0%
committee and I am really thrilled to be
 
01:42:54.550 --> 01:42:54.560 align:start position:0%
in front of you and AUST Committee of
 
01:42:56.629 --> 01:42:56.639 align:start position:0%
people that can make a difference here
 
01:42:58.350 --> 01:42:58.360 align:start position:0%
in our state of New Hampshire and what
 
01:43:02.070 --> 01:43:02.080 align:start position:0%
we're doing I look at this system as a
 
01:43:04.830 --> 01:43:04.840 align:start position:0%
chance to look at a leak and make sure
 
01:43:07.270 --> 01:43:07.280 align:start position:0%
it's not there I knew something was
 
01:43:10.589 --> 01:43:10.599 align:start position:0%
wrong we know something is wrong I have
 
01:43:13.470 --> 01:43:13.480 align:start position:0%
this I have pictures on my phone of when
 
01:43:16.149 --> 01:43:16.159 align:start position:0%
we were there in the archives building
 
01:43:18.550 --> 01:43:18.560 align:start position:0%
and when we spoke and we told people of
 
01:43:21.229 --> 01:43:21.239 align:start position:0%
what we found and we weren't looking to
 
01:43:23.669 --> 01:43:23.679 align:start position:0%
blame people we weren't looking to to
 
01:43:26.310 --> 01:43:26.320 align:start position:0%
make fun of people or look to penalize
 
01:43:29.830 --> 01:43:29.840 align:start position:0%
people we wanted them to see isn't that
 
01:43:32.229 --> 01:43:32.239 align:start position:0%
something we do all of the time isn't
 
01:43:34.750 --> 01:43:34.760 align:start position:0%
that what we have heard so desperately
 
01:43:37.950 --> 01:43:37.960 align:start position:0%
if you see something say something there
 
01:43:40.350 --> 01:43:40.360 align:start position:0%
is not one person I would imagine in
 
01:43:42.709 --> 01:43:42.719 align:start position:0%
this room that has not heard that or
 
01:43:44.910 --> 01:43:44.920 align:start position:0%
have we not listened to it and known of
 
01:43:47.830 --> 01:43:47.840 align:start position:0%
the importance and what it is well just
 
01:43:50.550 --> 01:43:50.560 align:start position:0%
like I saw something when no water came
 
01:43:53.109 --> 01:43:53.119 align:start position:0%
out only on one side I saw something
 
01:43:55.510 --> 01:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
something here and I have seen it
 
01:43:58.589 --> 01:43:58.599 align:start position:0%
consistently through many times many
 
01:44:01.270 --> 01:44:01.280 align:start position:0%
elections whether they be recounts or
 
01:44:04.030 --> 01:44:04.040 align:start position:0%
things in my own town or other towns I
 
01:44:06.589 --> 01:44:06.599 align:start position:0%
was brought into this and looking at it
 
01:44:09.669 --> 01:44:09.679 align:start position:0%
when I had as they say no skin in the
 
01:44:12.589 --> 01:44:12.599 align:start position:0%
game I'm from Hampstead I'm not from
 
01:44:15.270 --> 01:44:15.280 align:start position:0%
exor I'm not from these areas where
 
01:44:17.790 --> 01:44:17.800 align:start position:0%
others were represented and were talking
 
01:44:21.310 --> 01:44:21.320 align:start position:0%
I am from America I am a US citizen I am
 
01:44:23.790 --> 01:44:23.800 align:start position:0%
a New Hampshire Citizen and and I want
 
01:44:26.750 --> 01:44:26.760 align:start position:0%
and I pray that you listen to us that
 
01:44:29.470 --> 01:44:29.480 align:start position:0%
you look at this if you haven't seen it
 
01:44:31.589 --> 01:44:31.599 align:start position:0%
you should take the time and you will
 
01:44:34.709 --> 01:44:34.719 align:start position:0%
see the documentation you will see as Al
 
01:44:38.070 --> 01:44:38.080 align:start position:0%
has said 700 800 hours and I believe
 
01:44:40.750 --> 01:44:40.760 align:start position:0%
it's more of people that came and gave
 
01:44:43.669 --> 01:44:43.679 align:start position:0%
of their own time I'm a grandmother I
 
01:44:46.310 --> 01:44:46.320 align:start position:0%
started out with this because of wanting
 
01:44:47.870 --> 01:44:47.880 align:start position:0%
things for my children for my
 
01:44:50.870 --> 01:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
grandchildren I then it went on bigger
 
01:44:53.430 --> 01:44:53.440 align:start position:0%
it's from more than my town other towns
 
01:44:55.709 --> 01:44:55.719 align:start position:0%
it is for the country in general it is
 
01:44:58.189 --> 01:44:58.199 align:start position:0%
for everyone for all of our lives for
 
01:45:00.790 --> 01:45:00.800 align:start position:0%
our very Liberty we are here we are
 
01:45:03.550 --> 01:45:03.560 align:start position:0%
asked to support our state to do our
 
01:45:06.550 --> 01:45:06.560 align:start position:0%
duty and our duty is to help keep the
 
01:45:10.550 --> 01:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
election process open fair and another
 
01:45:12.669 --> 01:45:12.679 align:start position:0%
reason and I was listening to what the
 
01:45:15.229 --> 01:45:15.239 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State said we do not want
 
01:45:18.870 --> 01:45:18.880 align:start position:0%
to be punitive and yet and yet a couple
 
01:45:20.750 --> 01:45:20.760 align:start position:0%
of sentence later he said yeah we did
 
01:45:23.030 --> 01:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
take punitive damages against some
 
01:45:24.870 --> 01:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
people that there was a problem with
 
01:45:28.270 --> 01:45:28.280 align:start position:0%
recognize so there is and what are those
 
01:45:30.229 --> 01:45:30.239 align:start position:0%
damages I mean are we we're not talking
 
01:45:32.390 --> 01:45:32.400 align:start position:0%
about throwing somebody in jail or are
 
01:45:34.750 --> 01:45:34.760 align:start position:0%
we talking about stand in the corner we
 
01:45:37.589 --> 01:45:37.599 align:start position:0%
are just saying there might be some
 
01:45:40.510 --> 01:45:40.520 align:start position:0%
repercussions just pay attention maybe a
 
01:45:43.430 --> 01:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
time out but please just look at what
 
01:45:46.709 --> 01:45:46.719 align:start position:0%
you're doing try to be careful and as I
 
01:45:49.589 --> 01:45:49.599 align:start position:0%
was mentioned or heard before that less
 
01:45:52.390 --> 01:45:52.400 align:start position:0%
I was told the percentage was 30% of
 
01:45:55.229 --> 01:45:55.239 align:start position:0%
people that are trained because that's
 
01:45:57.350 --> 01:45:57.360 align:start position:0%
how many people volunteer their time and
 
01:45:59.750 --> 01:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
we understand it so I thank you very
 
01:46:03.510 --> 01:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
much for my uh speaking just as I am
 
01:46:05.189 --> 01:46:05.199 align:start position:0%
just as a citizen your average
 
01:46:07.310 --> 01:46:07.320 align:start position:0%
grandmother but someone who cares very
 
01:46:09.589 --> 01:46:09.599 align:start position:0%
much and very deeply and very
 
01:46:11.669 --> 01:46:11.679 align:start position:0%

01:46:22.030 --> 01:46:22.040 align:start position:0%
answers uh I don't see any questions
 
01:46:23.430 --> 01:46:23.440 align:start position:0%
from the committee so thank you very
 
01:46:26.390 --> 01:46:26.400 align:start position:0%

01:46:36.709 --> 01:46:36.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:40.709 --> 01:46:40.719 align:start position:0%
testify and so I will close the public
 
01:46:43.510 --> 01:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
hearing for HB 448 and since we're
 
01:46:43.520 --> 01:46:45.350 align:start position:0%
hearing for HB 448 and since we're
behind

01:46:45.350 --> 01:46:45.360 align:start position:0%
behind
 
01:46:47.629 --> 01:46:47.639 align:start position:0%
schedule uh I will be opening up the
 
01:46:49.830 --> 01:46:49.840 align:start position:0%

scheduled before noon
 
01:46:57.390 --> 01:46:57.400 align:start position:0%
I should read that I guess for HP 448 we
 
01:47:00.229 --> 01:47:00.239 align:start position:0%
had four people who wanted to express
 
01:47:03.189 --> 01:47:03.199 align:start position:0%
their opinion without uh testifying
 
01:47:05.830 --> 01:47:05.840 align:start position:0%
three were in favor of this bill and one
 
01:47:07.310 --> 01:47:07.320 align:start position:0%
was opposed to
 
01:47:09.470 --> 01:47:09.480 align:start position:0%
it all right I'm going to we have two
 
01:47:11.430 --> 01:47:11.440 align:start position:0%

01:48:34.189 --> 01:48:34.199 align:start position:0%
importantly the views and interests of

my constituents whom I serve in the
 
01:48:38.270 --> 01:48:38.280 align:start position:0%

any private employer nor should it be
 
01:48:51.310 --> 01:48:51.320 align:start position:0%
construed to represent the views of any
 
01:48:55.550 --> 01:48:55.560 align:start position:0%

01:49:01.910 --> 01:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
around the other way I have provided uh
 
01:49:03.350 --> 01:49:03.360 align:start position:0%
the the chairman and the clerk with a
 
01:49:05.990 --> 01:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
slightly larger package of exhibits uh
 
01:49:08.109 --> 01:49:08.119 align:start position:0%
elections are the Cornerstone of our
 
01:49:11.149 --> 01:49:11.159 align:start position:0%
democracy and election security is vital
 
01:49:13.669 --> 01:49:13.679 align:start position:0%
to maintaining trust in that process
 
01:49:16.229 --> 01:49:16.239 align:start position:0%
computers are deeply embedded in voter
 
01:49:18.830 --> 01:49:18.840 align:start position:0%
registration checklist maintenance
 
01:49:21.189 --> 01:49:21.199 align:start position:0%
ballot issuance vote counting and
 
01:49:23.310 --> 01:49:23.320 align:start position:0%
reporting to protect protect the public
 
01:49:25.750 --> 01:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
trust these systems must not only be
 
01:49:29.589 --> 01:49:29.599 align:start position:0%
secure but must also be seen as secure
 
01:49:31.790 --> 01:49:31.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has long been a leader in
 
01:49:34.390 --> 01:49:34.400 align:start position:0%
election Integrity since 1994 we've had
 
01:49:37.430 --> 01:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
the first in the nation paper trail law
 
01:49:39.990 --> 01:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
last November our historic election saw
 
01:49:42.870 --> 01:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
nearly 75% of eligible voters at the
 
01:49:45.030 --> 01:49:45.040 align:start position:0%
polls one of the highest participation
 
01:49:46.830 --> 01:49:46.840 align:start position:0%
rates in the nation and these figures
 
01:49:48.870 --> 01:49:48.880 align:start position:0%
reflect the Public's trust in our
 
01:49:51.109 --> 01:49:51.119 align:start position:0%
process and the excellent work of the
 
01:49:51.119 --> 01:49:52.750 align:start position:0%
process and the excellent work of the
secretary

01:49:52.750 --> 01:49:52.760 align:start position:0%
secretary
 
01:49:54.470 --> 01:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
this bill Builds on that Foundation it
 
01:49:56.270 --> 01:49:56.280 align:start position:0%
allows security researchers to assess
 
01:49:58.790 --> 01:49:58.800 align:start position:0%
the vulnerabilities and ensures findings
 
01:50:00.910 --> 01:50:00.920 align:start position:0%
are transparently reported by
 
01:50:04.149 --> 01:50:04.159 align:start position:0%
identifying and fixing potential flaws
 
01:50:06.669 --> 01:50:06.679 align:start position:0%
we bolster public trust and prevent Bad
 
01:50:09.270 --> 01:50:09.280 align:start position:0%
actors from exploiting weaknesses
 
01:50:11.669 --> 01:50:11.679 align:start position:0%
importantly this is a nonpartisan Bill
 
01:50:13.750 --> 01:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
elections may be partisan but the
 
01:50:16.189 --> 01:50:16.199 align:start position:0%
Machinery that powers them must not be
 
01:50:18.709 --> 01:50:18.719 align:start position:0%
this bill does not assert any current
 
01:50:21.149 --> 01:50:21.159 align:start position:0%
deficiencies but instead ensures
 
01:50:24.310 --> 01:50:24.320 align:start position:0%
continued trust and resilience I urge
 
01:50:26.510 --> 01:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State's office to go
 
01:50:28.990 --> 01:50:29.000 align:start position:0%
further than the bill mandates including
 
01:50:31.189 --> 01:50:31.199 align:start position:0%
creating a test instance of the voter
 
01:50:32.589 --> 01:50:32.599 align:start position:0%
registration database so that
 
01:50:35.030 --> 01:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
researchers May readily assess the user
 
01:50:37.510 --> 01:50:37.520 align:start position:0%
interfaces for Town clerks supervisors
 
01:50:39.270 --> 01:50:39.280 align:start position:0%
of the checklist and so forth
 
01:50:42.229 --> 01:50:42.239 align:start position:0%
transparency and security go hand inand
 
01:50:43.709 --> 01:50:43.719 align:start position:0%
and this initiative would help to
 
01:50:45.709 --> 01:50:45.719 align:start position:0%
position New Hampshire as a national
 
01:50:47.589 --> 01:50:47.599 align:start position:0%
leader in election security I've
 
01:50:49.790 --> 01:50:49.800 align:start position:0%

01:50:51.270 --> 01:50:51.280 align:start position:0%

and background and I'm happy to yield to
 
01:50:58.149 --> 01:50:58.159 align:start position:0%

testimony okay thank you do we have any
 
01:51:06.990 --> 01:51:07.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:09.149 --> 01:51:09.159 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you very
 
01:51:12.030 --> 01:51:12.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:14.229 --> 01:51:14.239 align:start position:0%
testimony I'm sorry I missed that
 
01:51:14.239 --> 01:51:15.350 align:start position:0%
testimony I'm sorry I missed that
representative

01:51:15.350 --> 01:51:15.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:51:18.030 --> 01:51:18.040 align:start position:0%
lry oh everyone's trying to get my
 
01:51:20.790 --> 01:51:20.800 align:start position:0%
attention here representative C you're
 
01:51:23.350 --> 01:51:23.360 align:start position:0%
recognized uh thank you chairman thank
 
01:51:27.189 --> 01:51:27.199 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question uh would this
 
01:51:29.790 --> 01:51:29.800 align:start position:0%
have anything to do with voting machines
 
01:51:31.589 --> 01:51:31.599 align:start position:0%
themselves yeah it's a great question
 
01:51:34.149 --> 01:51:34.159 align:start position:0%
Alvin the way that it's written uh it
 
01:51:36.589 --> 01:51:36.599 align:start position:0%
certainly would cover those but the the
 
01:51:38.589 --> 01:51:38.599 align:start position:0%
main focus of this the main thrust of
 
01:51:41.390 --> 01:51:41.400 align:start position:0%
this is not on voting machines the main
 
01:51:44.350 --> 01:51:44.360 align:start position:0%
thrust of this is that if a researcher
 
01:51:47.229 --> 01:51:47.239 align:start position:0%
is aware of a problem we want to know
 
01:51:49.589 --> 01:51:49.599 align:start position:0%
about it we want them to have an Avenue
 
01:51:51.950 --> 01:51:51.960 align:start position:0%
to be able to report that and I think
 
01:51:54.350 --> 01:51:54.360 align:start position:0%
we've had an awful lot of focus uh in
 
01:51:55.870 --> 01:51:55.880 align:start position:0%
the past in this state on our voting
 
01:51:57.589 --> 01:51:57.599 align:start position:0%
machines we have that paper trail law
 
01:52:00.030 --> 01:52:00.040 align:start position:0%
that I talked about so of course if if
 
01:52:02.510 --> 01:52:02.520 align:start position:0%
somebody tomorrow was to identify a a
 
01:52:04.229 --> 01:52:04.239 align:start position:0%
real security weakness in the voting
 
01:52:05.950 --> 01:52:05.960 align:start position:0%
machines I'm quite sure that the
 
01:52:07.350 --> 01:52:07.360 align:start position:0%
secretary would like to hear about it
 
01:52:08.629 --> 01:52:08.639 align:start position:0%
and they could use this kind of a
 
01:52:10.629 --> 01:52:10.639 align:start position:0%
disclosure mechanism to make that
 
01:52:12.830 --> 01:52:12.840 align:start position:0%
disclosure uh however the thing that was
 
01:52:15.189 --> 01:52:15.199 align:start position:0%
most in my mind uh when drafting this
 
01:52:17.510 --> 01:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
bill was that we have had uh slightly
 
01:52:19.589 --> 01:52:19.599 align:start position:0%
less Focus we've had certainly uh
 
01:52:21.589 --> 01:52:21.599 align:start position:0%
testing performed by the secretary's
 
01:52:22.990 --> 01:52:23.000 align:start position:0%
office and on their behalf half by
 
01:52:25.270 --> 01:52:25.280 align:start position:0%
contractors but in the public eye we've
 
01:52:27.510 --> 01:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
had less focus on things like the voter
 
01:52:27.520 --> 01:52:29.870 align:start position:0%
had less focus on things like the voter
registration

01:52:29.870 --> 01:52:29.880 align:start position:0%
registration
 
01:52:35.030 --> 01:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:37.390 --> 01:52:37.400 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you very
 
01:52:39.229 --> 01:52:39.239 align:start position:0%
much for your
 
01:52:43.310 --> 01:52:43.320 align:start position:0%
testimony I have no other red cards for
 
01:52:48.470 --> 01:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
the uh people to testify oh
 
01:52:51.270 --> 01:52:51.280 align:start position:0%
minute Mr chairman I will fill out a pen
 
01:52:53.030 --> 01:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
card I promise okay
 
01:52:55.629 --> 01:52:55.639 align:start position:0%
just just briefly I I uh I was
 
01:52:57.550 --> 01:52:57.560 align:start position:0%
interested in hearing the testimony on
 
01:53:00.069 --> 01:53:00.079 align:start position:0%
the bill uh I think it's a good idea the
 
01:53:03.270 --> 01:53:03.280 align:start position:0%
one concern that I would have is that if
 
01:53:06.030 --> 01:53:06.040 align:start position:0%
uh there are outside interests that are
 
01:53:07.030 --> 01:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
01:53:09.510 --> 01:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
vulnerabilities uh of our election
 
01:53:11.470 --> 01:53:11.480 align:start position:0%
systems that there be some kind of a
 
01:53:14.270 --> 01:53:14.280 align:start position:0%
mechanism to allow the Secretary of
 
01:53:18.030 --> 01:53:18.040 align:start position:0%
State to hear those cure them and then
 
01:53:20.470 --> 01:53:20.480 align:start position:0%
make them public so that we don't have a
 
01:53:23.229 --> 01:53:23.239 align:start position:0%
system that is potentially vulnerable
 
01:53:25.550 --> 01:53:25.560 align:start position:0%
uh in a public way
 
01:53:27.709 --> 01:53:27.719 align:start position:0%
um I think that's something that could
 
01:53:30.350 --> 01:53:30.360 align:start position:0%
easily be worked into the bill okay
 
01:53:32.510 --> 01:53:32.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for that uh will you take a
 
01:53:37.350 --> 01:53:37.360 align:start position:0%
question on that or uh representative C
 
01:53:38.709 --> 01:53:38.719 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:53:42.669 --> 01:53:42.679 align:start position:0%
secretary for taking my question um it I
 
01:53:45.149 --> 01:53:45.159 align:start position:0%
just in reading the bill it looks like
 
01:53:47.870 --> 01:53:47.880 align:start position:0%
it should be somewhat expensive to do
 
01:53:49.990 --> 01:53:50.000 align:start position:0%
this but there's no fiscal note on this
 
01:53:54.069 --> 01:53:54.079 align:start position:0%
bill uh what's your take on that
 
01:53:56.109 --> 01:53:56.119 align:start position:0%
uh deputy secretary Hennessy just came
 
01:53:58.270 --> 01:53:58.280 align:start position:0%
in she's been drafting the fiscal notes
 
01:54:00.629 --> 01:54:00.639 align:start position:0%
on the bills I'm not sure if she put one
 
01:54:02.550 --> 01:54:02.560 align:start position:0%
together on this or not but she'd be in
 
01:54:11.270 --> 01:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:11.280 --> 01:54:14.589 align:start position:0%
 
comment

01:54:14.589 --> 01:54:14.599 align:start position:0%

present HB 327 and again this testimony
 
01:56:19.750 --> 01:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
is not made on behalf of any private
 
01:56:21.069 --> 01:56:21.079 align:start position:0%
employer nor should it be construed to
 
01:56:23.030 --> 01:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
represent the views of any of my
 
01:56:25.550 --> 01:56:25.560 align:start position:0%
employers uh this bill addresses two
 
01:56:28.069 --> 01:56:28.079 align:start position:0%
practical challenges in the election
 
01:56:29.950 --> 01:56:29.960 align:start position:0%
filing process in the the filing process
 
01:56:32.030 --> 01:56:32.040 align:start position:0%
for candidates for elections that have
 
01:56:34.830 --> 01:56:34.840 align:start position:0%
caused unnecessary confusion delays and
 
01:56:36.790 --> 01:56:36.800 align:start position:0%
expense for candidates as well as
 
01:56:39.069 --> 01:56:39.079 align:start position:0%
difficulties for Town officials under
 
01:56:41.629 --> 01:56:41.639 align:start position:0%
current law candidates must file their
 
01:56:44.310 --> 01:56:44.320 align:start position:0%
paperwork during a limited 10 calendar
 
01:56:48.350 --> 01:56:48.360 align:start position:0%
day period uh per RSA 65514 as we all
 
01:56:51.709 --> 01:56:51.719 align:start position:0%
know in many towns this works smoothly
 
01:56:54.790 --> 01:56:54.800 align:start position:0%
but in small towns with part-time clerks
 
01:56:56.990 --> 01:56:57.000 align:start position:0%
uh there can be unique challenges
 
01:56:59.870 --> 01:56:59.880 align:start position:0%
Clerk's offices may only be open once or
 
01:57:02.990 --> 01:57:03.000 align:start position:0%
twice during the filing window or not at
 
01:57:06.069 --> 01:57:06.079 align:start position:0%
all due to illness or other unforeseen
 
01:57:08.229 --> 01:57:08.239 align:start position:0%
circumstances for candidates this can
 
01:57:09.589 --> 01:57:09.599 align:start position:0%
create significant barriers to
 
01:57:12.229 --> 01:57:12.239 align:start position:0%
completing their filings additionally
 
01:57:14.790 --> 01:57:14.800 align:start position:0%
there is a reasonable expectation that
 
01:57:17.109 --> 01:57:17.119 align:start position:0%
candidates filing in person should be
 
01:57:18.990 --> 01:57:19.000 align:start position:0%
able to present themselves before the
 
01:57:21.550 --> 01:57:21.560 align:start position:0%
town clerk or their deputy and complete
 
01:57:24.229 --> 01:57:24.239 align:start position:0%
their part of the process typically the
 
01:57:26.750 --> 01:57:26.760 align:start position:0%
forms themselves are obtained from the
 
01:57:29.149 --> 01:57:29.159 align:start position:0%
town clerk while this process works
 
01:57:31.669 --> 01:57:31.679 align:start position:0%
smoothly in many towns problems have
 
01:57:33.430 --> 01:57:33.440 align:start position:0%
Arisen because some Town clerks and
 
01:57:36.709 --> 01:57:36.719 align:start position:0%
their deputies are not notaries public
 
01:57:39.030 --> 01:57:39.040 align:start position:0%
when a notary is unavailable candidates
 
01:57:40.430 --> 01:57:40.440 align:start position:0%
have been told their filings were
 
01:57:42.550 --> 01:57:42.560 align:start position:0%
complete only later to learn that the
 
01:57:44.310 --> 01:57:44.320 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office had rejected
 
01:57:46.390 --> 01:57:46.400 align:start position:0%
them these candidates are then forced to
 
01:57:48.229 --> 01:57:48.239 align:start position:0%
scramble to meet deadlines take time off
 
01:57:50.350 --> 01:57:50.360 align:start position:0%
work and incur additional costs to fix
 
01:57:52.229 --> 01:57:52.239 align:start position:0%
these issues the challenges are not
 
01:57:54.310 --> 01:57:54.320 align:start position:0%
partisan they are avoidable with minor
 
01:57:57.069 --> 01:57:57.079 align:start position:0%
changes to current law House Bill 327
 
01:58:00.669 --> 01:58:00.679 align:start position:0%
proposes two simple practical Solutions
 
01:58:02.430 --> 01:58:02.440 align:start position:0%
number one for filing with the Secretary
 
01:58:04.830 --> 01:58:04.840 align:start position:0%
of State in towns where Clerk's Offices
 
01:58:07.870 --> 01:58:07.880 align:start position:0%
hours are limited candidates would have
 
01:58:09.069 --> 01:58:09.079 align:start position:0%
the option to file directly with the
 
01:58:11.270 --> 01:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State here in conquer this
 
01:58:13.669 --> 01:58:13.679 align:start position:0%
ensures all candidates have equal access
 
01:58:15.870 --> 01:58:15.880 align:start position:0%
to the filing process regardless of
 
01:58:16.950 --> 01:58:16.960 align:start position:0%
their Town
 
01:58:19.990 --> 01:58:20.000 align:start position:0%
circumstances number two Town clerks
 
01:58:21.669 --> 01:58:21.679 align:start position:0%
would be able to witness affidavits
 
01:58:24.069 --> 01:58:24.079 align:start position:0%
without regard to whether or not they
 
01:58:26.669 --> 01:58:26.679 align:start position:0%
are notaries public this streamlines the
 
01:58:28.709 --> 01:58:28.719 align:start position:0%
process in small towns where the clerk
 
01:58:31.390 --> 01:58:31.400 align:start position:0%
or his Deputy is not a notary these
 
01:58:33.430 --> 01:58:33.440 align:start position:0%
changes are practical and narrowly
 
01:58:35.189 --> 01:58:35.199 align:start position:0%
tailored to address the specific issues
 
01:58:37.350 --> 01:58:37.360 align:start position:0%
which have Arisen without imposing any
 
01:58:39.790 --> 01:58:39.800 align:start position:0%
significant new burdens on the parties
 
01:58:42.109 --> 01:58:42.119 align:start position:0%
involved filing for public office is a
 
01:58:44.310 --> 01:58:44.320 align:start position:0%
Cornerstone of our democratic system we
 
01:58:46.589 --> 01:58:46.599 align:start position:0%
have a duty to ensure that candidates
 
01:58:49.030 --> 01:58:49.040 align:start position:0%
for office can navigate this process
 
01:58:50.629 --> 01:58:50.639 align:start position:0%
fairly and
 
01:58:52.870 --> 01:58:52.880 align:start position:0%
effectively these proposed changes do
 
01:58:54.390 --> 01:58:54.400 align:start position:0%
not alter the responsibilities of
 
01:58:56.390 --> 01:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
candidates or the core requirements of
 
01:58:58.550 --> 01:58:58.560 align:start position:0%
the process instead they provide
 
01:59:00.669 --> 01:59:00.679 align:start position:0%
practical solutions to real barriers
 
01:59:02.069 --> 01:59:02.079 align:start position:0%
that have Arisen under the current
 
01:59:04.709 --> 01:59:04.719 align:start position:0%
statutes and importantly this bill
 
01:59:06.629 --> 01:59:06.639 align:start position:0%
upholds the Integrity of our election
 
01:59:08.870 --> 01:59:08.880 align:start position:0%
systems while ensuring access and
 
01:59:10.589 --> 01:59:10.599 align:start position:0%
fairness for all I've spoken with the
 
01:59:12.589 --> 01:59:12.599 align:start position:0%
secretary to my understanding he
 
01:59:15.629 --> 01:59:15.639 align:start position:0%
supports this proposal House Bill 327 is
 
01:59:17.950 --> 01:59:17.960 align:start position:0%
a non-controversial common sense bill
 
01:59:19.669 --> 01:59:19.679 align:start position:0%
that promotes good governance and I urge
 
01:59:21.589 --> 01:59:21.599 align:start position:0%
the committee to recommend this bill for
 
01:59:24.069 --> 01:59:24.079 align:start position:0%
Passage and consider its suitability for
 
01:59:25.669 --> 01:59:25.679 align:start position:0%
the consent calendar I welcome any
 
01:59:27.510 --> 01:59:27.520 align:start position:0%
questions and I'm happy to provide
 
01:59:29.750 --> 01:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
further clarification thank you thank
 
01:59:32.229 --> 01:59:32.239 align:start position:0%
you um I'll start off the first question
 
01:59:33.750 --> 01:59:33.760 align:start position:0%
uh and tip my hand to a question I think
 
01:59:35.870 --> 01:59:35.880 align:start position:0%
I'll ask the secretary or his
 
01:59:38.430 --> 01:59:38.440 align:start position:0%
representative um I I don't I don't love
 
01:59:41.390 --> 01:59:41.400 align:start position:0%
the idea of having like three separate
 
01:59:43.790 --> 01:59:43.800 align:start position:0%
days 18 hours I honestly I'd rather just
 
01:59:45.910 --> 01:59:45.920 align:start position:0%
say you can register your town clerk or
 
01:59:46.910 --> 01:59:46.920 align:start position:0%
you can register in the Secretary of
 
01:59:48.310 --> 01:59:48.320 align:start position:0%
State's office and just get rid of the
 
01:59:50.430 --> 01:59:50.440 align:start position:0%
convoluted how many hours you open how
 
01:59:52.189 --> 01:59:52.199 align:start position:0%
many days are you open that will
 
01:59:54.149 --> 01:59:54.159 align:start position:0%
inevitably cause a headache would that
 
01:59:55.870 --> 01:59:55.880 align:start position:0%
be an issue for you as a sponsor if we
 
01:59:56.950 --> 01:59:56.960 align:start position:0%
just went
 
01:59:59.109 --> 01:59:59.119 align:start position:0%
to yep you can register the secretary
 
02:00:00.270 --> 02:00:00.280 align:start position:0%
state's office or you can register your
 
02:00:02.109 --> 02:00:02.119 align:start position:0%
town clerk yeah it certainly wouldn't be
 
02:00:04.750 --> 02:00:04.760 align:start position:0%
a concern for me chairman uh I I think
 
02:00:06.790 --> 02:00:06.800 align:start position:0%
the reason that I put it in in that way
 
02:00:08.589 --> 02:00:08.599 align:start position:0%
is because I do recognize that there's
 
02:00:11.109 --> 02:00:11.119 align:start position:0%
the potential uh for increased volume
 
02:00:13.229 --> 02:00:13.239 align:start position:0%
here in conquer and in conversations
 
02:00:15.870 --> 02:00:15.880 align:start position:0%
with the secretary uh we we felt that
 
02:00:19.310 --> 02:00:19.320 align:start position:0%
that was uh a very reasonable uh you
 
02:00:22.069 --> 02:00:22.079 align:start position:0%
know way to to define the level I I
 
02:00:23.390 --> 02:00:23.400 align:start position:0%
think I you should probably have that
 
02:00:25.870 --> 02:00:25.880 align:start position:0%
conversation with him we will which is
 
02:00:27.350 --> 02:00:27.360 align:start position:0%
why I kind of backwardly asked him
 
02:00:28.830 --> 02:00:28.840 align:start position:0%
through you so he knows he can think
 
02:00:32.189 --> 02:00:32.199 align:start position:0%
think about it um uh any other questions
 
02:00:34.709 --> 02:00:34.719 align:start position:0%
from the committee representative
 
02:00:37.229 --> 02:00:37.239 align:start position:0%
Bay thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
02:00:41.030 --> 02:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question um isn't it also
 
02:00:42.430 --> 02:00:42.440 align:start position:0%
would you consider it a practical
 
02:00:46.669 --> 02:00:46.679 align:start position:0%
alternative to um require Town clerks to
 
02:00:48.470 --> 02:00:48.480 align:start position:0%
be notor
 
02:00:51.229 --> 02:00:51.239 align:start position:0%
public it's a great question and and I I
 
02:00:52.669 --> 02:00:52.679 align:start position:0%
figured that somebody would ask that I
 
02:00:54.430 --> 02:00:54.440 align:start position:0%
let me tell you uh I'm going to make
 
02:00:56.430 --> 02:00:56.440 align:start position:0%
reference again to my town uh by way of
 
02:00:57.870 --> 02:00:57.880 align:start position:0%
example and this is not limited to me
 
02:00:59.669 --> 02:00:59.679 align:start position:0%
I've heard similar issues from from
 
02:01:02.589 --> 02:01:02.599 align:start position:0%
other uh candidates and and uh elected
 
02:01:04.669 --> 02:01:04.679 align:start position:0%
officials whom we all know um but in the
 
02:01:06.270 --> 02:01:06.280 align:start position:0%
town of orange that secretary scanland
 
02:01:08.709 --> 02:01:08.719 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier uh we are a small town
 
02:01:13.390 --> 02:01:13.400 align:start position:0%
uh we typically pay very nominal um you
 
02:01:15.149 --> 02:01:15.159 align:start position:0%
know salaries or or or alley rates
 
02:01:18.750 --> 02:01:18.760 align:start position:0%
whatever to our officials and it is very
 
02:01:21.629 --> 02:01:21.639 align:start position:0%
hard to find people to fill those roles
 
02:01:24.109 --> 02:01:24.119 align:start position:0%
um for a number of years we have had
 
02:01:26.390 --> 02:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
Town clerks who uh were not thrilled
 
02:01:28.069 --> 02:01:28.079 align:start position:0%
about doing the job but were happy to to
 
02:01:30.669 --> 02:01:30.679 align:start position:0%
dedicate themselves to doing that job
 
02:01:34.189 --> 02:01:34.199 align:start position:0%
and who did not have uh a notary public
 
02:01:36.510 --> 02:01:36.520 align:start position:0%
uh qualification so I think in answer to
 
02:01:38.030 --> 02:01:38.040 align:start position:0%
your question if we were to make that
 
02:01:40.109 --> 02:01:40.119 align:start position:0%
stipulation just as when we make other
 
02:01:42.189 --> 02:01:42.199 align:start position:0%
stipulations that put additional burdens
 
02:01:45.149 --> 02:01:45.159 align:start position:0%
on these officials all you are doing is
 
02:01:47.310 --> 02:01:47.320 align:start position:0%
uh causing fewer and fewer people to be
 
02:01:49.030 --> 02:01:49.040 align:start position:0%
willing to step forward uh in their
 
02:01:49.040 --> 02:01:50.510 align:start position:0%
willing to step forward uh in their
local

02:01:50.510 --> 02:01:50.520 align:start position:0%
local
 
02:01:52.990 --> 02:01:53.000 align:start position:0%
Town well uh sorry further questions
 
02:01:55.030 --> 02:01:55.040 align:start position:0%
from the committee seeing none thank you
 
02:01:58.430 --> 02:01:58.440 align:start position:0%
representative McFarland um thank
 
02:02:05.229 --> 02:02:05.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:07.430 --> 02:02:07.440 align:start position:0%
Hennessy thank you Mr chair members of
 
02:02:09.310 --> 02:02:09.320 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Aaron Hennessy
 
02:02:11.109 --> 02:02:11.119 align:start position:0%
I am the deputy secretary of state and
 
02:02:13.470 --> 02:02:13.480 align:start position:0%
our office supports this bill we
 
02:02:17.030 --> 02:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
currently take um filings for office for
 
02:02:21.069 --> 02:02:21.079 align:start position:0%
any County officers uh state senators um
 
02:02:23.589 --> 02:02:23.599 align:start position:0%
and every office above that um we do
 
02:02:25.149 --> 02:02:25.159 align:start position:0%
feel like this would make our office
 
02:02:27.830 --> 02:02:27.840 align:start position:0%
busier during the filing period however
 
02:02:29.589 --> 02:02:29.599 align:start position:0%
um it's our job to process all of those
 
02:02:33.109 --> 02:02:33.119 align:start position:0%
filings at some point anyway um so we
 
02:02:36.790 --> 02:02:36.800 align:start position:0%
are happy to take on this additional um
 
02:02:39.550 --> 02:02:39.560 align:start position:0%
the add the additional filings uh to the
 
02:02:42.030 --> 02:02:42.040 align:start position:0%
chair and his question about opening up
 
02:02:43.750 --> 02:02:43.760 align:start position:0%
to all Representatives I did have a
 
02:02:45.870 --> 02:02:45.880 align:start position:0%
concern about the language in the bill
 
02:02:48.629 --> 02:02:48.639 align:start position:0%
normally and routinely um just our
 
02:02:50.550 --> 02:02:50.560 align:start position:0%
office would have to do research for
 
02:02:52.629 --> 02:02:52.639 align:start position:0%
each rep that came into file to make
 
02:02:54.870 --> 02:02:54.880 align:start position:0%
sure that their clerk normally and
 
02:02:57.589 --> 02:02:57.599 align:start position:0%
routinely was only open under the
 
02:03:00.149 --> 02:03:00.159 align:start position:0%
language of this law um which would be
 
02:03:02.189 --> 02:03:02.199 align:start position:0%
difficult because we only have access to
 
02:03:03.790 --> 02:03:03.800 align:start position:0%
their website we really don't know what
 
02:03:06.709 --> 02:03:06.719 align:start position:0%
their normal routine hours are so if
 
02:03:08.790 --> 02:03:08.800 align:start position:0%
that could be fixed or just removed in
 
02:03:10.750 --> 02:03:10.760 align:start position:0%
general that would be appreciated I'm
 
02:03:12.870 --> 02:03:12.880 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions questions from
 
02:03:16.149 --> 02:03:16.159 align:start position:0%
the committee um yes representative
 
02:03:18.669 --> 02:03:18.679 align:start position:0%
C uh thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
02:03:21.229 --> 02:03:21.239 align:start position:0%
deputy secretary for taking my question
 
02:03:24.910 --> 02:03:24.920 align:start position:0%
um do you have any concerns about a uh
 
02:03:31.069 --> 02:03:31.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:35.069 --> 02:03:35.079 align:start position:0%
notary I am not what I can tell you is
 
02:03:36.750 --> 02:03:36.760 align:start position:0%
that if you require a clerk to be a
 
02:03:39.750 --> 02:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
notary there is a there's a timeline
 
02:03:42.270 --> 02:03:42.280 align:start position:0%
that it takes to become a notary so if
 
02:03:44.549 --> 02:03:44.559 align:start position:0%
there're uh SW if a deputy's sworn in a
 
02:03:46.709 --> 02:03:46.719 align:start position:0%
new Deputy is sworn in it will take
 
02:03:48.750 --> 02:03:48.760 align:start position:0%
several months to become a notary and
 
02:03:51.069 --> 02:03:51.079 align:start position:0%
there may be a filing period in that
 
02:03:52.669 --> 02:03:52.679 align:start position:0%
time in which
 
02:03:55.270 --> 02:03:55.280 align:start position:0%
um somebody comes into their office so I
 
02:03:57.470 --> 02:03:57.480 align:start position:0%
believe this is like a legislative
 
02:04:01.069 --> 02:04:01.079 align:start position:0%
priority versus a and it's specifically
 
02:04:03.750 --> 02:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
for the filings and not any
 
02:04:07.350 --> 02:04:07.360 align:start position:0%
other um option so all right thank you
 
02:04:09.990 --> 02:04:10.000 align:start position:0%
uh further questions and um I don't I
 
02:04:11.310 --> 02:04:11.320 align:start position:0%
don't know if you or the secretary want
 
02:04:14.109 --> 02:04:14.119 align:start position:0%
to address my question which is can we
 
02:04:16.270 --> 02:04:16.280 align:start position:0%
just stop being treated like second
 
02:04:17.830 --> 02:04:17.840 align:start position:0%
class citizens of State reps and file
 
02:04:19.790 --> 02:04:19.800 align:start position:0%
with the
 
02:04:21.990 --> 02:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
Senators Mr chairman I think the answer
 
02:04:25.350 --> 02:04:25.360 align:start position:0%
to that is yes we can do that and I did
 
02:04:27.310 --> 02:04:27.320 align:start position:0%
want to add although I'm not advocating
 
02:04:30.430 --> 02:04:30.440 align:start position:0%
for a June primary but if there happened
 
02:04:31.010 --> 02:04:31.020 align:start position:0%
to be
 
02:04:31.020 --> 02:04:33.430 align:start position:0%
to be
[Laughter]

02:04:33.430 --> 02:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
02:04:35.830 --> 02:04:35.840 align:start position:0%
one if if there happened to be a filing
 
02:04:37.669 --> 02:04:37.679 align:start position:0%
period in March it would certainly be
 
02:04:40.750 --> 02:04:40.760 align:start position:0%
very convenient for uh incumbents to
 
02:04:41.950 --> 02:04:41.960 align:start position:0%
file in our
 
02:04:44.229 --> 02:04:44.239 align:start position:0%
office just a quick answer to
 
02:04:47.390 --> 02:04:47.400 align:start position:0%
representative C's question
 
02:04:50.470 --> 02:04:50.480 align:start position:0%
um you have to pass a background check
 
02:04:52.669 --> 02:04:52.679 align:start position:0%
to become a notary
 
02:04:54.709 --> 02:04:54.719 align:start position:0%
um and if you don't pass you have to get
 
02:04:56.589 --> 02:04:56.599 align:start position:0%
the approval from an executive counselor
 
02:04:59.189 --> 02:04:59.199 align:start position:0%
so it is possible that there may be some
 
02:05:01.189 --> 02:05:01.199 align:start position:0%
clerks that get elected that have
 
02:05:03.430 --> 02:05:03.440 align:start position:0%
something in their background that could
 
02:05:05.069 --> 02:05:05.079 align:start position:0%
prevent that prevent them from becoming
 
02:05:05.079 --> 02:05:07.950 align:start position:0%
prevent that prevent them from becoming
a

02:05:07.950 --> 02:05:07.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:10.830 --> 02:05:10.840 align:start position:0%
notary yes representa C uh just as a
 
02:05:13.229 --> 02:05:13.239 align:start position:0%
followup on that
 
02:05:16.390 --> 02:05:16.400 align:start position:0%
um it is there any concern that you
 
02:05:18.709 --> 02:05:18.719 align:start position:0%
would have about a person not being a
 
02:05:21.109 --> 02:05:21.119 align:start position:0%
notary because as I recall when I filed
 
02:05:25.109 --> 02:05:25.119 align:start position:0%
I didn't the paper wasn't notorized
 
02:05:27.870 --> 02:05:27.880 align:start position:0%
I think on those types of documents an
 
02:05:31.430 --> 02:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
election official can sign in L of a
 
02:05:33.229 --> 02:05:33.239 align:start position:0%
notary I'll have to check the statute
 
02:05:33.239 --> 02:05:35.589 align:start position:0%
notary I'll have to check the statute
but

02:05:35.589 --> 02:05:35.599 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:05:37.870 --> 02:05:37.880 align:start position:0%
um I I I would note that election
 
02:05:39.430 --> 02:05:39.440 align:start position:0%
officials are
 
02:05:39.440 --> 02:05:41.030 align:start position:0%
officials are
elected

02:05:41.030 --> 02:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
elected
 
02:05:42.990 --> 02:05:43.000 align:start position:0%
so it's not like they haven't undergone
 
02:05:45.870 --> 02:05:45.880 align:start position:0%
some scrutiny um any other uh questions
 
02:05:47.109 --> 02:05:47.119 align:start position:0%

02:05:49.470 --> 02:05:49.480 align:start position:0%

campaign website which is the only
 
02:06:43.950 --> 02:06:43.960 align:start position:0%
website I have access to um a calendar
 
02:06:47.549 --> 02:06:47.559 align:start position:0%
so you can see all of the bills um when
 
02:06:49.350 --> 02:06:49.360 align:start position:0%
they've been scheduled uh if they've
 
02:06:50.629 --> 02:06:50.639 align:start position:0%
been scheduled where they are in the
 
02:06:53.030 --> 02:06:53.040 align:start position:0%
process uh that is what I use to track
 
02:06:54.629 --> 02:06:54.639 align:start position:0%
the bills it's the same sheet it's
 
02:06:56.750 --> 02:06:56.760 align:start position:0%
nothing special um but I wanted to make
 
02:06:58.750 --> 02:06:58.760 align:start position:0%
that available to the public um that was
 
02:07:00.350 --> 02:07:00.360 align:start position:0%
the only way that I could really do that
 
02:07:02.790 --> 02:07:02.800 align:start position:0%

okay it's 105 we're going yet going I'm

going to open up the public hearing for
 
03:06:47.590 --> 03:06:47.600 align:start position:0%
the house election law committee for
 
03:06:51.070 --> 03:06:51.080 align:start position:0%
Bill House Bill 630 FN preventing the
 
03:06:53.070 --> 03:06:53.080 align:start position:0%
dissemination of deep fake materials of
 
03:06:55.429 --> 03:06:55.439 align:start position:0%
political candidates before an election
 
03:06:57.110 --> 03:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
representative Corman is recognized for
 
03:06:59.630 --> 03:06:59.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:02.790 --> 03:07:02.800 align:start position:0%
introduction thank you Mr chairman for
 
03:07:04.269 --> 03:07:04.279 align:start position:0%
those who don't know me I'm
 
03:07:06.870 --> 03:07:06.880 align:start position:0%
representative Tom Corman I represent
 
03:07:09.950 --> 03:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
the fight and 15th Grafton 15 which is
 
03:07:12.630 --> 03:07:12.640 align:start position:0%
Ward three of the city of Lebanon the
 
03:07:15.990 --> 03:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
beautiful city of Lebanon uh I need to
 
03:07:17.229 --> 03:07:17.239 align:start position:0%
give you some background first about
 
03:07:19.070 --> 03:07:19.080 align:start position:0%
myself myself and and how I got involved
 
03:07:21.429 --> 03:07:21.439 align:start position:0%
in all this I'm an Emeritus professor of
 
03:07:23.349 --> 03:07:23.359 align:start position:0%
computer science at Dartmouth College
 
03:07:26.309 --> 03:07:26.319 align:start position:0%
where I was on the faculty for 29 and a
 
03:07:28.750 --> 03:07:28.760 align:start position:0%
half years and I chaired the computer
 
03:07:31.670 --> 03:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
science department for six years from uh
 
03:07:32.990 --> 03:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
2009 to
 
03:07:36.469 --> 03:07:36.479 align:start position:0%
2015 so uh as department chair I
 
03:07:38.150 --> 03:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
certainly had to keep my eye on what was
 
03:07:39.790 --> 03:07:39.800 align:start position:0%
going on throughout the entire field of
 
03:07:41.590 --> 03:07:41.600 align:start position:0%
computer science but actually I've been
 
03:07:43.870 --> 03:07:43.880 align:start position:0%
in computer science since
 
03:07:46.349 --> 03:07:46.359 align:start position:0%
1974 and you don't need a computer to
 
03:07:48.070 --> 03:07:48.080 align:start position:0%
determine that's over
 
03:07:52.070 --> 03:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
years uh I have uh eecs electrical
 
03:07:53.990 --> 03:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
engineering and computer science degrees
 
03:07:57.030 --> 03:07:57.040 align:start position:0%
from Princeton and from MIT I got my
 
03:07:59.670 --> 03:07:59.680 align:start position:0%
masters and PhD from MIT where I spent
 
03:08:01.990 --> 03:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
eight years I'm actually quite well
 
03:08:03.830 --> 03:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
known within Computer Sciences the lead
 
03:08:07.710 --> 03:08:07.720 align:start position:0%
author of a textbook introduction to
 
03:08:10.510 --> 03:08:10.520 align:start position:0%
algorithms I say all this because I have
 
03:08:12.469 --> 03:08:12.479 align:start position:0%
a background in computer science it's
 
03:08:15.150 --> 03:08:15.160 align:start position:0%
not in artificial intelligence uh which
 
03:08:17.110 --> 03:08:17.120 align:start position:0%
this bill is somewhat about and it's not
 
03:08:17.120 --> 03:08:18.429 align:start position:0%
this bill is somewhat about and it's not
in

03:08:18.429 --> 03:08:18.439 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:08:21.269 --> 03:08:21.279 align:start position:0%
digital media but again I've had to keep
 
03:08:23.190 --> 03:08:23.200 align:start position:0%
my eye on all this and I've been
 
03:08:25.990 --> 03:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
tracking all this for a long time so
 
03:08:29.389 --> 03:08:29.399 align:start position:0%
last year this committee had the bill HB
 
03:08:32.630 --> 03:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
1596 which prohibits deceptive AI
 
03:08:35.910 --> 03:08:35.920 align:start position:0%
generated deep fakes during elections I
 
03:08:38.229 --> 03:08:38.239 align:start position:0%
co-sponsored that bill uh it was
 
03:08:40.630 --> 03:08:40.640 align:start position:0%
sponsored by representative Brennan I
 
03:08:42.630 --> 03:08:42.640 align:start position:0%
co-sponsored it in large part because I
 
03:08:44.630 --> 03:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
have tracked AI since I entered grad
 
03:08:48.630 --> 03:08:48.640 align:start position:0%
school in 1984 so that was 4 1 years
 
03:08:51.710 --> 03:08:51.720 align:start position:0%
ago and I didn't do research in AI as I
 
03:08:53.830 --> 03:08:53.840 align:start position:0%
said but I've seen the explosive growth
 
03:08:57.630 --> 03:08:57.640 align:start position:0%
in AI over the last decade and we know
 
03:09:00.110 --> 03:09:00.120 align:start position:0%
that AI is capable of creating deep
 
03:09:02.630 --> 03:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
fakes that can easily fool many people
 
03:09:05.150 --> 03:09:05.160 align:start position:0%
very easily and the bill from last year
 
03:09:09.590 --> 03:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
HB 1596 allows for injunctive relief for
 
03:09:11.429 --> 03:09:11.439 align:start position:0%
and other relief for deceptive deep
 
03:09:14.830 --> 03:09:14.840 align:start position:0%
fakes within 90 days of an election and
 
03:09:17.590 --> 03:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
it allows for deep fakes that are
 
03:09:19.670 --> 03:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
labeled as such so if somebody creates a
 
03:09:21.990 --> 03:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
deep fake and says this uh was created
 
03:09:24.469 --> 03:09:24.479 align:start position:0%
with artificial intelligence it uh
 
03:09:27.510 --> 03:09:27.520 align:start position:0%
allows somebody who deep who distributes
 
03:09:30.070 --> 03:09:30.080 align:start position:0%
a deep fake unknowingly so if if you
 
03:09:32.269 --> 03:09:32.279 align:start position:0%
receive a deep fake you don't know it's
 
03:09:33.990 --> 03:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
a deep fake you don't suspect it is and
 
03:09:36.030 --> 03:09:36.040 align:start position:0%
you send it on you're not liable for
 
03:09:38.750 --> 03:09:38.760 align:start position:0%
anything and for news stories that are
 
03:09:40.110 --> 03:09:40.120 align:start position:0%
about deep fakes that would show the
 
03:09:42.590 --> 03:09:42.600 align:start position:0%
Deep fake so if Channel 9 says you know
 
03:09:44.710 --> 03:09:44.720 align:start position:0%
here's a story about a deep fake and
 
03:09:46.190 --> 03:09:46.200 align:start position:0%
they show the Deep fake but they made it
 
03:09:47.630 --> 03:09:47.640 align:start position:0%
clear that they believe this is deep
 
03:09:51.910 --> 03:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
fake that's okay and also for satire and
 
03:09:55.110 --> 03:09:55.120 align:start position:0%
parody so the sponsor and I worked with
 
03:09:57.469 --> 03:09:57.479 align:start position:0%
members of this committee and with the
 
03:09:59.950 --> 03:09:59.960 align:start position:0%
Senate to amend the bill to the point
 
03:10:01.950 --> 03:10:01.960 align:start position:0%
that people on both sides of the aisle
 
03:10:04.110 --> 03:10:04.120 align:start position:0%
were satisfied with the bill and it has
 
03:10:07.110 --> 03:10:07.120 align:start position:0%
been enacted it is currently RSA
 
03:10:09.550 --> 03:10:09.560 align:start position:0%
664 colon
 
03:10:13.349 --> 03:10:13.359 align:start position:0%
14c so that's where we are right now
 
03:10:15.309 --> 03:10:15.319 align:start position:0%
last fall I was at a talk at Dartmouth
 
03:10:18.070 --> 03:10:18.080 align:start position:0%
given by professor hany fari
 
03:10:19.910 --> 03:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
Professor freed is a good friend of mine
 
03:10:21.710 --> 03:10:21.720 align:start position:0%
former colleague at Dartmouth for 20
 
03:10:23.550 --> 03:10:23.560 align:start position:0%
years and he's now a professor at the
 
03:10:26.190 --> 03:10:26.200 align:start position:0%
University of California at Berkeley he
 
03:10:29.590 --> 03:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
is an expert in digital media forensics
 
03:10:31.429 --> 03:10:31.439 align:start position:0%
which is determining whether media is
 
03:10:33.349 --> 03:10:33.359 align:start position:0%
genuine or digitally altered or
 
03:10:36.389 --> 03:10:36.399 align:start position:0%
digitally created and when I say he's an
 
03:10:39.429 --> 03:10:39.439 align:start position:0%
expert he might even be the world's
 
03:10:40.950 --> 03:10:40.960 align:start position:0%
expert he's certainly one of the most
 
03:10:42.550 --> 03:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
brilliant people I've ever known and I
 
03:10:44.710 --> 03:10:44.720 align:start position:0%
knew a lot of people at MIT who were
 
03:10:47.590 --> 03:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
just you know several standard deviation
 
03:10:50.269 --> 03:10:50.279 align:start position:0%
above the likes of me and he's in that
 
03:10:52.910 --> 03:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
category brilliant brilliant man and uh
 
03:10:54.070 --> 03:10:54.080 align:start position:0%
with the chair's permission I'll be
 
03:10:55.630 --> 03:10:55.640 align:start position:0%
reading a letter from him into the
 
03:10:57.150 --> 03:10:57.160 align:start position:0%
record for a few minutes you all have
 
03:10:59.469 --> 03:10:59.479 align:start position:0%
copies of the of the letter I told
 
03:11:01.990 --> 03:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
Professor fed about this bill that we'
 
03:11:04.870 --> 03:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
passed and some others related to Ai and
 
03:11:08.790 --> 03:11:08.800 align:start position:0%
his reaction was that the bill 1596 did
 
03:11:11.389 --> 03:11:11.399 align:start position:0%
not go far enough he said it's become
 
03:11:13.950 --> 03:11:13.960 align:start position:0%
too easy to alter digital media without
 
03:11:16.870 --> 03:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
AI so using tools such as Photoshop a
 
03:11:19.710 --> 03:11:19.720 align:start position:0%
good Photoshop expert can create a
 
03:11:22.429 --> 03:11:22.439 align:start position:0%
pretty good deep fake that will fool a
 
03:11:23.590 --> 03:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
lot of
 
03:11:26.349 --> 03:11:26.359 align:start position:0%
people so after this conversation I
 
03:11:29.190 --> 03:11:29.200 align:start position:0%
looked more closely at hb1
 
03:11:32.910 --> 03:11:32.920 align:start position:0%
1596 and it defines four terms synthetic
 
03:11:37.750 --> 03:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
media AI generative Ai and deep fake
 
03:11:40.670 --> 03:11:40.680 align:start position:0%
seems reasonable but when I looked at
 
03:11:43.349 --> 03:11:43.359 align:start position:0%
the rest of the bill I realized that the
 
03:11:47.229 --> 03:11:47.239 align:start position:0%
term synthetic media did not appear any
 
03:11:48.710 --> 03:11:48.720 align:start position:0%
anywhere in the bill after it was
 
03:11:51.190 --> 03:11:51.200 align:start position:0%
defined it wasn't used anywhere else in
 
03:11:54.870 --> 03:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
the bill so the bill actually is really
 
03:11:58.670 --> 03:11:58.680 align:start position:0%
only about deep fakes generated with
 
03:12:03.429 --> 03:12:03.439 align:start position:0%
AI so the bill before you 630 uses the
 
03:12:06.150 --> 03:12:06.160 align:start position:0%
definition of synthetic media to also
 
03:12:10.429 --> 03:12:10.439 align:start position:0%
Define synthetic media technology as any
 
03:12:12.830 --> 03:12:12.840 align:start position:0%
digital technology that can be used to
 
03:12:15.389 --> 03:12:15.399 align:start position:0%
produce synthetic media including
 
03:12:18.389 --> 03:12:18.399 align:start position:0%
artificial intelligence or Genera AI so
 
03:12:20.950 --> 03:12:20.960 align:start position:0%
synthetic media technology can include
 
03:12:23.670 --> 03:12:23.680 align:start position:0%
AI behind it but it doesn't have to so
 
03:12:27.710 --> 03:12:27.720 align:start position:0%
if you think of Photoshop or even Garage
 
03:12:30.550 --> 03:12:30.560 align:start position:0%
Band right that that can be synthetic
 
03:12:32.950 --> 03:12:32.960 align:start position:0%
media something produced by synthetic
 
03:12:38.590 --> 03:12:38.600 align:start position:0%
media so everywhere else in RSA
 
03:12:41.630 --> 03:12:41.640 align:start position:0%
66414 C that mentions deep fakes
 
03:12:44.790 --> 03:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
produced using AI or generative AI this
 
03:12:46.710 --> 03:12:46.720 align:start position:0%
bill changes it to deep fakes you
 
03:12:49.190 --> 03:12:49.200 align:start position:0%
produced using synthetic media
 
03:12:52.510 --> 03:12:52.520 align:start position:0%
technology so that non AI software is
 
03:12:53.830 --> 03:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
covered as well so that's the the
 
03:12:57.110 --> 03:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
purpose of this bill to expand the Deep
 
03:13:00.070 --> 03:13:00.080 align:start position:0%
fakes covered in election season to
 
03:13:02.830 --> 03:13:02.840 align:start position:0%
include anything produced by synthetic
 
03:13:06.910 --> 03:13:06.920 align:start position:0%
media technology not just AI based
 
03:13:09.429 --> 03:13:09.439 align:start position:0%
synthetic media technology and with the
 
03:13:11.309 --> 03:13:11.319 align:start position:0%
chair's permission I would like to read
 
03:13:14.910 --> 03:13:14.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:17.830 --> 03:13:17.840 align:start position:0%
fared let's I I would I would prefer not
 
03:13:19.950 --> 03:13:19.960 align:start position:0%
um we have the copy of the letter um it
 
03:13:21.349 --> 03:13:21.359 align:start position:0%
will be a part of the public record the
 
03:13:24.150 --> 03:13:24.160 align:start position:0%
clerk has it um but we have a lot of
 
03:13:25.590 --> 03:13:25.600 align:start position:0%
bills and I don't want to how many other
 
03:13:26.950 --> 03:13:26.960 align:start position:0%
people actually let me see that how many
 
03:13:28.830 --> 03:13:28.840 align:start position:0%
people have signed up for
 
03:13:30.950 --> 03:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
this just one actually it's fine there
 
03:13:32.150 --> 03:13:32.160 align:start position:0%
just one other person signed up so not a
 
03:13:33.229 --> 03:13:33.239 align:start position:0%
big deal we're it's not going to if it
 
03:13:35.550 --> 03:13:35.560 align:start position:0%
was going to throw us off I would say no
 
03:13:38.630 --> 03:13:38.640 align:start position:0%
but you're fine thank you so this is
 
03:13:41.469 --> 03:13:41.479 align:start position:0%
from Professor free dated January 25th I
 
03:13:44.229 --> 03:13:44.239 align:start position:0%
write in support of HB 630 FN I have
 
03:13:45.550 --> 03:13:45.560 align:start position:0%
read this bill and I agree with the
 
03:13:48.870 --> 03:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
sponsor that it strengthens HB 1596 from
 
03:13:52.670 --> 03:13:52.680 align:start position:0%
2024 in an important way for background
 
03:13:54.429 --> 03:13:54.439 align:start position:0%
I've been conducting research in digital
 
03:13:58.110 --> 03:13:58.120 align:start position:0%
media forensic since 1999 with over 200
 
03:14:01.150 --> 03:14:01.160 align:start position:0%
peer-reviewed Publications in the field
 
03:14:03.349 --> 03:14:03.359 align:start position:0%
I'm frequently called upon as an expert
 
03:14:05.510 --> 03:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
witness in cases in which the veracity
 
03:14:07.990 --> 03:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
of digital media is at question I have
 
03:14:09.950 --> 03:14:09.960 align:start position:0%
testified many times before the US
 
03:14:12.990 --> 03:14:13.000 align:start position:0%
Senate US House EU Parliament and UK
 
03:14:15.550 --> 03:14:15.560 align:start position:0%
Parliament on issues of digital media
 
03:14:18.309 --> 03:14:18.319 align:start position:0%
integrity and appropriate regulatory
 
03:14:20.349 --> 03:14:20.359 align:start position:0%
interventions I was on the faculty at
 
03:14:22.110 --> 03:14:22.120 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth College for 20 years which is
 
03:14:25.110 --> 03:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
where I met representative then
 
03:14:27.030 --> 03:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
Professor Corman and I've been on the
 
03:14:28.630 --> 03:14:28.640 align:start position:0%
faculty at the University of California
 
03:14:29.870 --> 03:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
Berkeley since
 
03:14:33.670 --> 03:14:33.680 align:start position:0%
2019 HB 1596 prohibited deceptive deep
 
03:14:36.190 --> 03:14:36.200 align:start position:0%
fakes within 90 days of an election but
 
03:14:38.630 --> 03:14:38.640 align:start position:0%
it prohibited only deep fakes generated
 
03:14:41.190 --> 03:14:41.200 align:start position:0%
by artificial intelligence this is an
 
03:14:43.550 --> 03:14:43.560 align:start position:0%
overly and unnecessarily narrow
 
03:14:45.910 --> 03:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
definition of deep fakes that does not
 
03:14:48.190 --> 03:14:48.200 align:start position:0%
contend with the reality of today's
 
03:14:51.870 --> 03:14:51.880 align:start position:0%
landscape of manipulated and malicious
 
03:14:54.630 --> 03:14:54.640 align:start position:0%
content digital media technology has
 
03:14:56.950 --> 03:14:56.960 align:start position:0%
evolved to the point that many users can
 
03:15:00.070 --> 03:15:00.080 align:start position:0%
create convincing fake media that are so
 
03:15:02.269 --> 03:15:02.279 align:start position:0%
realistic that determining that they are
 
03:15:04.030 --> 03:15:04.040 align:start position:0%
specifically generated with AI
 
03:15:06.870 --> 03:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
Technologies is challenging and requires
 
03:15:09.950 --> 03:15:09.960 align:start position:0%
highly specialized software in addition
 
03:15:11.349 --> 03:15:11.359 align:start position:0%
there are many ways for creating
 
03:15:13.710 --> 03:15:13.720 align:start position:0%
misleading or malicious content that
 
03:15:16.030 --> 03:15:16.040 align:start position:0%
does not require the use of AI
 
03:15:17.349 --> 03:15:17.359 align:start position:0%
precautions against selection
 
03:15:18.950 --> 03:15:18.960 align:start position:0%
interference should focus on the
 
03:15:21.910 --> 03:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
malicious content and not on the
 
03:15:25.469 --> 03:15:25.479 align:start position:0%
specific mechanism or technique used to
 
03:15:29.750 --> 03:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
create that content HB 630 FN recognizes
 
03:15:31.910 --> 03:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
these realities by defining synthetic
 
03:15:34.790 --> 03:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
media technology to include any digital
 
03:15:36.670 --> 03:15:36.680 align:start position:0%
technology that can produce synthetic
 
03:15:39.070 --> 03:15:39.080 align:start position:0%
media and by prohibiting deceptive deep
 
03:15:41.269 --> 03:15:41.279 align:start position:0%
fakes created by synthetic media
 
03:15:43.710 --> 03:15:43.720 align:start position:0%
technology during election season
 
03:15:45.429 --> 03:15:45.439 align:start position:0%
instances of deep fakes in the public
 
03:15:48.070 --> 03:15:48.080 align:start position:0%
sphere abound both domestically and
 
03:15:49.950 --> 03:15:49.960 align:start position:0%
internationally and as you know in New
 
03:15:52.070 --> 03:15:52.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire deep fakes have already found
 
03:15:54.510 --> 03:15:54.520 align:start position:0%
their way into elections by expanding
 
03:15:56.309 --> 03:15:56.319 align:start position:0%
the scope of deep fakes to include all
 
03:16:00.110 --> 03:16:00.120 align:start position:0%
synthetic media HB 630 FN will provide
 
03:16:02.389 --> 03:16:02.399 align:start position:0%
additional safeguards in elections
 
03:16:05.349 --> 03:16:05.359 align:start position:0%
signed H fed Professor UC
 
03:16:08.229 --> 03:16:08.239 align:start position:0%
Berkeley and with that I am happy to
 
03:16:09.750 --> 03:16:09.760 align:start position:0%
take questions okay other questions from
 
03:16:09.760 --> 03:16:11.950 align:start position:0%
take questions okay other questions from
the

03:16:11.950 --> 03:16:11.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:14.830 --> 03:16:14.840 align:start position:0%
committee uh yes representative wood
 
03:16:16.469 --> 03:16:16.479 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
03:16:19.150 --> 03:16:19.160 align:start position:0%
the take my question um I definitely on
 
03:16:21.670 --> 03:16:21.680 align:start position:0%
the same page I I didn't understand when
 
03:16:24.670 --> 03:16:24.680 align:start position:0%
they focused this bill on AI versus the
 
03:16:27.790 --> 03:16:27.800 align:start position:0%
other techniques out there um why does
 
03:16:31.429 --> 03:16:31.439 align:start position:0%
Bill even necessary you know to me um
 
03:16:34.590 --> 03:16:34.600 align:start position:0%
digitally I can create Illusions even
 
03:16:38.590 --> 03:16:38.600 align:start position:0%
without using the per person's uh uh
 
03:16:42.790 --> 03:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
Voice or fa features just by using the
 
03:16:45.030 --> 03:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
media out there saying that he said this
 
03:16:47.469 --> 03:16:47.479 align:start position:0%
showing examples of other people saying
 
03:16:49.189 --> 03:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
there's so many ways to create an
 
03:16:52.590 --> 03:16:52.600 align:start position:0%
illusion I think this bill missed all of
 
03:16:54.590 --> 03:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
that stuff I think most of this is
 
03:16:56.710 --> 03:16:56.720 align:start position:0%
already covered if you're smart enough
 
03:16:58.469 --> 03:16:58.479 align:start position:0%
to find these things or willing to find
 
03:17:00.429 --> 03:17:00.439 align:start position:0%
these things but just because we got
 
03:17:02.950 --> 03:17:02.960 align:start position:0%
some technology that makes it easier
 
03:17:04.269 --> 03:17:04.279 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that this hasn't been done
 
03:17:07.189 --> 03:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
for years and is covered already in
 
03:17:09.349 --> 03:17:09.359 align:start position:0%
election law as far as I understand as
 
03:17:10.990 --> 03:17:11.000 align:start position:0%
long as you can prove it you got the
 
03:17:14.710 --> 03:17:14.720 align:start position:0%
same problem here why is this sorry to
 
03:17:17.189 --> 03:17:17.199 align:start position:0%
be this is more my opinion you I
 
03:17:18.590 --> 03:17:18.600 align:start position:0%
apologize to the
 
03:17:21.510 --> 03:17:21.520 align:start position:0%
board yes thank you I'm I'm amazed you
 
03:17:24.670 --> 03:17:24.680 align:start position:0%
let me go that long thank thank you Mr
 
03:17:27.750 --> 03:17:27.760 align:start position:0%
chairman yeah I got it uh how do you
 
03:17:29.510 --> 03:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
think that's different sorry how do how
 
03:17:30.790 --> 03:17:30.800 align:start position:0%
do you think it's different than what I
 
03:17:32.590 --> 03:17:32.600 align:start position:0%
just did thank you all right thank you
 
03:17:34.269 --> 03:17:34.279 align:start position:0%
for the
 
03:17:37.070 --> 03:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
question what what the bill from last
 
03:17:40.710 --> 03:17:40.720 align:start position:0%
year did was it focused on on synthetic
 
03:17:42.950 --> 03:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
media generated by
 
03:17:45.710 --> 03:17:45.720 align:start position:0%
Ai and it didn't cover any other
 
03:17:48.269 --> 03:17:48.279 align:start position:0%
synthetic media so if you were really
 
03:17:50.990 --> 03:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
good with I don't know Garage Band you
 
03:17:54.229 --> 03:17:54.239 align:start position:0%
could take clips of me talking and just
 
03:17:55.790 --> 03:17:55.800 align:start position:0%
make it sound like I'm saying something
 
03:17:57.670 --> 03:17:57.680 align:start position:0%
I've never said or if you're really good
 
03:17:59.550 --> 03:17:59.560 align:start position:0%
with Photoshop you could create an image
 
03:18:00.950 --> 03:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
of me robbing a
 
03:18:03.510 --> 03:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
bank which I have not
 
03:18:06.510 --> 03:18:06.520 align:start position:0%
done and allegedly I have allegedly not
 
03:18:09.469 --> 03:18:09.479 align:start position:0%
done and what this bill does is it just
 
03:18:12.309 --> 03:18:12.319 align:start position:0%
says all right if you're using other
 
03:18:16.229 --> 03:18:16.239 align:start position:0%
software other digital uh media software
 
03:18:18.269 --> 03:18:18.279 align:start position:0%
to create it then then that would be
 
03:18:20.910 --> 03:18:20.920 align:start position:0%
covered under this bill um I mean you're
 
03:18:22.990 --> 03:18:23.000 align:start position:0%
right that these things could be done
 
03:18:24.469 --> 03:18:24.479 align:start position:0%
and and what we're trying to do is cover
 
03:18:27.429 --> 03:18:27.439 align:start position:0%
them under the law as far as whether
 
03:18:29.429 --> 03:18:29.439 align:start position:0%
that's already covered under election
 
03:18:31.030 --> 03:18:31.040 align:start position:0%
law you know you're the election law
 
03:18:32.870 --> 03:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
committee I hope you know the laws I'm
 
03:18:34.710 --> 03:18:34.720 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm in Science Tech and energy I
 
03:18:38.229 --> 03:18:38.239 align:start position:0%
know the energy laws so um I'll have to
 
03:18:39.710 --> 03:18:39.720 align:start position:0%
leave it to you whether it's already
 
03:18:44.429 --> 03:18:44.439 align:start position:0%
covered um the one thing I would uh say
 
03:18:44.439 --> 03:18:45.550 align:start position:0%
covered um the one thing I would uh say
then

03:18:45.550 --> 03:18:45.560 align:start position:0%
then
 
03:18:49.349 --> 03:18:49.359 align:start position:0%
is well was the part about AI already
 
03:18:52.309 --> 03:18:52.319 align:start position:0%
covered why did we need that
 
03:18:54.790 --> 03:18:54.800 align:start position:0%
bill I love answering the question with
 
03:18:55.870 --> 03:18:55.880 align:start position:0%
the questions my one of my favorite
 
03:18:59.150 --> 03:18:59.160 align:start position:0%
things to do um representative weary uh
 
03:19:00.510 --> 03:19:00.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:19:01.990 --> 03:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
03:19:04.670 --> 03:19:04.680 align:start position:0%
just so in in I don't know if you have
 
03:19:07.429 --> 03:19:07.439 align:start position:0%
your bill in front of you but um so
 
03:19:11.269 --> 03:19:11.279 align:start position:0%
under synthetic media in one onea it
 
03:19:13.349 --> 03:19:13.359 align:start position:0%
talks about other digital
 
03:19:17.030 --> 03:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
technology would would that
 
03:19:18.670 --> 03:19:18.680 align:start position:0%
but there it's talking about the media
 
03:19:21.630 --> 03:19:21.640 align:start position:0%
being created so it implies that digital
 
03:19:23.590 --> 03:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
techn I'm
 
03:19:27.710 --> 03:19:27.720 align:start position:0%
just I'm I'm loathed to add uh
 
03:19:31.910 --> 03:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
definitions if we can avoid that and and
 
03:19:34.750 --> 03:19:34.760 align:start position:0%
I'm and then is is there any specific
 
03:19:38.710 --> 03:19:38.720 align:start position:0%
justification for a a deep deep fake
 
03:19:43.070 --> 03:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
down in line 23 as as opposed to just a
 
03:19:47.110 --> 03:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
message that um you know uh synthetic
 
03:19:49.750 --> 03:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
media message you know something along
 
03:19:51.590 --> 03:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
those lines I I I'm
 
03:19:53.870 --> 03:19:53.880 align:start position:0%
just uh cautious
 
03:19:53.880 --> 03:19:55.630 align:start position:0%
just uh cautious
about

03:19:55.630 --> 03:19:55.640 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:19:58.269 --> 03:19:58.279 align:start position:0%
um trying to find
 
03:20:01.990 --> 03:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
two uh find a point on this so do you
 
03:20:04.590 --> 03:20:04.600 align:start position:0%
think digital technology is included in
 
03:20:06.229 --> 03:20:06.239 align:start position:0%
this initial
 
03:20:09.229 --> 03:20:09.239 align:start position:0%
definition in the initial definition of
 
03:20:11.550 --> 03:20:11.560 align:start position:0%
of synthetic media so it talks about
 
03:20:13.950 --> 03:20:13.960 align:start position:0%
adversarial Network techniques it is
 
03:20:15.229 --> 03:20:15.239 align:start position:0%
included in the in the original
 
03:20:18.269 --> 03:20:18.279 align:start position:0%
definition of synthetic media however um
 
03:20:20.429 --> 03:20:20.439 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned when I read the bill when
 
03:20:24.670 --> 03:20:24.680 align:start position:0%
I read uh 1596 from last year although
 
03:20:28.309 --> 03:20:28.319 align:start position:0%
synthetic media is defined it isn't used
 
03:20:29.710 --> 03:20:29.720 align:start position:0%
anywhere else in the
 
03:20:32.830 --> 03:20:32.840 align:start position:0%
bill so you know it's it's just a dead
 
03:20:35.950 --> 03:20:35.960 align:start position:0%
end definition so my main purpose with
 
03:20:38.750 --> 03:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
this bill was to actually incorporate
 
03:20:41.550 --> 03:20:41.560 align:start position:0%
the notion of synthetic media into what
 
03:20:44.349 --> 03:20:44.359 align:start position:0%
would be covered and the places uh where
 
03:20:46.030 --> 03:20:46.040 align:start position:0%
the original bill and the current law
 
03:20:48.790 --> 03:20:48.800 align:start position:0%
say message M um I suggested that it
 
03:20:51.550 --> 03:20:51.560 align:start position:0%
should say deep fake because a deep fake
 
03:20:53.910 --> 03:20:53.920 align:start position:0%
means that you're showing uh you're
 
03:20:56.189 --> 03:20:56.199 align:start position:0%
creating media that shows somebody doing
 
03:20:58.110 --> 03:20:58.120 align:start position:0%
or saying something that they didn't do
 
03:20:58.120 --> 03:21:00.469 align:start position:0%
or saying something that they didn't do
or

03:21:00.469 --> 03:21:00.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:02.990 --> 03:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
say okay but you gotta get you gotta get
 
03:21:04.870 --> 03:21:04.880 align:start position:0%
question quickly on this so would you
 
03:21:07.710 --> 03:21:07.720 align:start position:0%
have any objections if we just send send
 
03:21:10.229 --> 03:21:10.239 align:start position:0%
said instead of message we said
 
03:21:12.870 --> 03:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
synthetic media and then instead of
 
03:21:15.550 --> 03:21:15.560 align:start position:0%
artificial intelligence or generative AI
 
03:21:18.349 --> 03:21:18.359 align:start position:0%
if we just said digital
 
03:21:18.359 --> 03:21:20.030 align:start position:0%
if we just said digital
technology

03:21:20.030 --> 03:21:20.040 align:start position:0%
technology
 
03:21:22.550 --> 03:21:22.560 align:start position:0%
um I don't know that I would object I
 
03:21:26.269 --> 03:21:26.279 align:start position:0%
don't see um I don't see where that
 
03:21:28.630 --> 03:21:28.640 align:start position:0%
provides an advantage over what is in
 
03:21:32.429 --> 03:21:32.439 align:start position:0%
the bill okay thank you any further
 
03:21:34.870 --> 03:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
03:21:36.469 --> 03:21:36.479 align:start position:0%
you um only one other person sign to
 
03:21:55.510 --> 03:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:57.110 --> 03:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
um good afternoon chairman and members
 
03:21:58.389 --> 03:21:58.399 align:start position:0%
of the committee for the record my name
 
03:22:00.030 --> 03:22:00.040 align:start position:0%
is Olivia zinc executive director at
 
03:22:02.590 --> 03:22:02.600 align:start position:0%
open democracy I live in Franklin um and
 
03:22:04.750 --> 03:22:04.760 align:start position:0%
I'm testifying in support of House Bill
 
03:22:08.750 --> 03:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
6 um30 um as technology rapidly advances
 
03:22:11.469 --> 03:22:11.479 align:start position:0%
artificial intelligence and deep fa are
 
03:22:14.750 --> 03:22:14.760 align:start position:0%
becoming more pervasive in our society
 
03:22:18.030 --> 03:22:18.040 align:start position:0%
um on my phone I have a a voicemail that
 
03:22:20.710 --> 03:22:20.720 align:start position:0%
I was left before the primary on my home
 
03:22:22.910 --> 03:22:22.920 align:start position:0%
voicemail um and it doesn't have a
 
03:22:26.349 --> 03:22:26.359 align:start position:0%
disclosure of who paid for it um so this
 
03:22:28.349 --> 03:22:28.359 align:start position:0%
this bill what it does is just requires
 
03:22:31.950 --> 03:22:31.960 align:start position:0%
disclosure of of anything that's created
 
03:22:35.150 --> 03:22:35.160 align:start position:0%
um using using this it doesn't prohibit
 
03:22:36.670 --> 03:22:36.680 align:start position:0%
people from doing it just requires
 
03:22:40.030 --> 03:22:40.040 align:start position:0%
disclosure disclosure um and we support
 
03:22:41.670 --> 03:22:41.680 align:start position:0%
adding these definitions because of
 
03:22:44.349 --> 03:22:44.359 align:start position:0%
photos videos audio audio recorders
 
03:22:47.670 --> 03:22:47.680 align:start position:0%
could mimic anything um to more accurate
 
03:22:47.680 --> 03:22:48.870 align:start position:0%
could mimic anything um to more accurate
and

03:22:48.870 --> 03:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:22:51.030 --> 03:22:51.040 align:start position:0%
believable um could you imagine if you
 
03:22:52.870 --> 03:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
lost election because somebody said you
 
03:22:54.309 --> 03:22:54.319 align:start position:0%
were saying something so say we said
 
03:22:56.590 --> 03:22:56.600 align:start position:0%
Shan Barry likes Mars Bars have no idea
 
03:22:59.389 --> 03:22:59.399 align:start position:0%
if you like that kind of candy bar or
 
03:23:02.469 --> 03:23:02.479 align:start position:0%
not um but people could make up whatever
 
03:23:06.189 --> 03:23:06.199 align:start position:0%
message they want and distribute it um
 
03:23:07.910 --> 03:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
and say don't vote for this candidate
 
03:23:10.950 --> 03:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
because of any reason and so I think um
 
03:23:12.110 --> 03:23:12.120 align:start position:0%
I want to thank this committee for
 
03:23:14.189 --> 03:23:14.199 align:start position:0%
working really hard in a bipartisan way
 
03:23:17.670 --> 03:23:17.680 align:start position:0%
to pass a bill uh such as this um and
 
03:23:19.469 --> 03:23:19.479 align:start position:0%
this bill just strengthens the work that
 
03:23:22.229 --> 03:23:22.239 align:start position:0%
was done last year
 
03:23:26.070 --> 03:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
um as as technology evolves so um we
 
03:23:28.790 --> 03:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
urge you to to support um moving this
 
03:23:30.790 --> 03:23:30.800 align:start position:0%
bill forward and happy to take any
 
03:23:33.349 --> 03:23:33.359 align:start position:0%
questions other questions from the
 
03:23:37.150 --> 03:23:37.160 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you um all
 
03:23:38.429 --> 03:23:38.439 align:start position:0%
right is there anyone else present who
 
03:23:41.110 --> 03:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
wishes to speak to this bill I don't see
 
03:23:42.750 --> 03:23:42.760 align:start position:0%
any thank you um with have the blue
 
03:23:45.670 --> 03:23:45.680 align:start position:0%
sheet it's blank um online there were 36
 
03:23:48.550 --> 03:23:48.560 align:start position:0%
in support Z opposed um the committee
 
03:23:50.630 --> 03:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
I'm going to close the public hearing on
 
03:23:53.670 --> 03:23:53.680 align:start position:0%
House Bill 6:30 U the committee will
 
03:23:56.189 --> 03:23:56.199 align:start position:0%
stand in recess for 8 minutes until 1:30

of stacks what I'm going to do is I'm
 
03:26:47.790 --> 03:26:47.800 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to lay them out on this

Comm
 
03:33:48.389 --> 03:33:48.399 align:start position:0%
representative Grill we haven't heard
 
03:33:49.590 --> 03:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
from you
 
03:33:54.510 --> 03:33:54.520 align:start position:0%
today um hi uh my question is um for
 
03:33:57.950 --> 03:33:57.960 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan elections um and offices
 
03:34:00.510 --> 03:34:00.520 align:start position:0%
that are elected on a nonpartisan basis
 
03:34:04.710 --> 03:34:04.720 align:start position:0%
how would that uh party registration be
 
03:34:07.750 --> 03:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
determined um like I sorry that was
 
03:34:09.750 --> 03:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
probably confusing wording I guess like
 
03:34:11.429 --> 03:34:11.439 align:start position:0%
for the local elections is that what
 
03:34:13.349 --> 03:34:13.359 align:start position:0%
you're pertaining to like school board
 
03:34:15.870 --> 03:34:15.880 align:start position:0%
or yeah I guess I'm just a a little
 
03:34:15.880 --> 03:34:16.950 align:start position:0%
or yeah I guess I'm just a a little
confused

03:34:16.950 --> 03:34:16.960 align:start position:0%
confused
 
03:34:20.389 --> 03:34:20.399 align:start position:0%
of if um if that would be an effect for
 
03:34:23.630 --> 03:34:23.640 align:start position:0%
all elections only the partisan ones um
 
03:34:25.710 --> 03:34:25.720 align:start position:0%
and a lot of times these offices are
 
03:34:28.429 --> 03:34:28.439 align:start position:0%
elected without party registration so
 
03:34:31.110 --> 03:34:31.120 align:start position:0%
you could get for example a slate of all
 
03:34:33.349 --> 03:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
Republican uh moderators clerks or
 
03:34:35.670 --> 03:34:35.680 align:start position:0%
another town all Democrat uh moderators
 
03:34:37.870 --> 03:34:37.880 align:start position:0%
and clerks um I
 
03:34:40.990 --> 03:34:41.000 align:start position:0%
guess how would that person be selected
 
03:34:43.670 --> 03:34:43.680 align:start position:0%
in in those instances um well I believe
 
03:34:44.950 --> 03:34:44.960 align:start position:0%
that there are some towns that are
 
03:34:44.960 --> 03:34:46.229 align:start position:0%
that there are some towns that are
bipartisan

03:34:46.229 --> 03:34:46.239 align:start position:0%
bipartisan
 
03:34:48.070 --> 03:34:48.080 align:start position:0%
so I think it should just be consistent
 
03:34:50.309 --> 03:34:50.319 align:start position:0%
all the way around um and it just kind
 
03:34:53.670 --> 03:34:53.680 align:start position:0%
of shows um a balance to the system by
 
03:34:55.070 --> 03:34:55.080 align:start position:0%
choosing it that
 
03:34:55.080 --> 03:34:59.349 align:start position:0%
choosing it that
way

03:34:59.349 --> 03:34:59.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:01.229 --> 03:35:01.239 align:start position:0%
okay doing double duty here
 
03:35:01.239 --> 03:35:02.269 align:start position:0%
okay doing double duty here
representative

03:35:02.269 --> 03:35:02.279 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:35:04.710 --> 03:35:04.720 align:start position:0%
C thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
03:35:06.990 --> 03:35:07.000 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question uh
 
03:35:08.670 --> 03:35:08.680 align:start position:0%
this sort of follows on uh
 
03:35:10.670 --> 03:35:10.680 align:start position:0%
representative Grill's question what
 
03:35:12.349 --> 03:35:12.359 align:start position:0%
happens if the moderator is registered
 
03:35:14.349 --> 03:35:14.359 align:start position:0%
as an independent who would be the
 
03:35:17.950 --> 03:35:17.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:19.790 --> 03:35:19.800 align:start position:0%
well that's a good question I would just
 
03:35:21.670 --> 03:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
assume that it would be another part a
 
03:35:23.790 --> 03:35:23.800 align:start position:0%
different party member doesn't
 
03:35:26.790 --> 03:35:26.800 align:start position:0%
necessarily mean one of the as long
 
03:35:28.670 --> 03:35:28.680 align:start position:0%
somebody different and not another
 
03:35:31.550 --> 03:35:31.560 align:start position:0%
independent maybe that's not
 
03:35:34.189 --> 03:35:34.199 align:start position:0%
clear I was just trying to figure out
 
03:35:35.790 --> 03:35:35.800 align:start position:0%
what you intended I got to do ask for a
 
03:35:37.710 --> 03:35:37.720 align:start position:0%
followup there they they they spoke with
 
03:35:39.110 --> 03:35:39.120 align:start position:0%
us about that at the chair's meeting
 
03:35:43.710 --> 03:35:43.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:46.030 --> 03:35:46.040 align:start position:0%
questions okay seeing none thank you
 
03:35:47.870 --> 03:35:47.880 align:start position:0%
representative Burnham and I'm going to
 
03:35:51.510 --> 03:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
email you my very short notes thank you
 
03:35:54.550 --> 03:35:54.560 align:start position:0%
um next up is bro Dees with the New
 
03:35:57.950 --> 03:35:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:00.670 --> 03:36:00.680 align:start position:0%
Association welcome to election
 
03:36:03.150 --> 03:36:03.160 align:start position:0%
law thank you Mr chairman thank you to
 
03:36:06.229 --> 03:36:06.239 align:start position:0%
the committee for taking my testimony um
 
03:36:08.590 --> 03:36:08.600 align:start position:0%
so the New Hampshire
 
03:36:10.790 --> 03:36:10.800 align:start position:0%
municip sorry excuse me the New
 
03:36:13.070 --> 03:36:13.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal Association is
 
03:36:15.790 --> 03:36:15.800 align:start position:0%
opposed to House Bill 474
 
03:36:18.189 --> 03:36:18.199 align:start position:0%
um the addition of the of the last
 
03:36:19.990 --> 03:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
sentence is a little bit confusing for
 
03:36:22.910 --> 03:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
us to try to interpret um our current
 
03:36:25.349 --> 03:36:25.359 align:start position:0%
interpretation is that this is um
 
03:36:27.990 --> 03:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
implying that folks who are moderators
 
03:36:29.990 --> 03:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
inherently have a um that they've
 
03:36:31.870 --> 03:36:31.880 align:start position:0%
declared a party and that therefore they
 
03:36:34.030 --> 03:36:34.040 align:start position:0%
would have to find someone else of the
 
03:36:36.670 --> 03:36:36.680 align:start position:0%
opposing party um there can be sometimes
 
03:36:38.429 --> 03:36:38.439 align:start position:0%
uh multiple opposing parties in a state
 
03:36:40.710 --> 03:36:40.720 align:start position:0%
right now though the two um recognized
 
03:36:43.189 --> 03:36:43.199 align:start position:0%
parties are Republican and Democratic so
 
03:36:44.229 --> 03:36:44.239 align:start position:0%
I guess the assumption would be if
 
03:36:45.630 --> 03:36:45.640 align:start position:0%
you're a republican you need to find a
 
03:36:47.389 --> 03:36:47.399 align:start position:0%
Democrat if you are a Democrat then you
 
03:36:50.030 --> 03:36:50.040 align:start position:0%
need to find a republican to partake in
 
03:36:52.830 --> 03:36:52.840 align:start position:0%
the process of reviewing the uh righten
 
03:36:56.189 --> 03:36:56.199 align:start position:0%
votes um our concern is the burden um
 
03:36:58.670 --> 03:36:58.680 align:start position:0%
the vagueness and how that is done it's
 
03:37:01.870 --> 03:37:01.880 align:start position:0%
not really entirely um spelled out how
 
03:37:03.590 --> 03:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
exactly a moderator would appoint
 
03:37:05.269 --> 03:37:05.279 align:start position:0%
someone would they swear them in as if
 
03:37:07.110 --> 03:37:07.120 align:start position:0%
they were an assistant moderator those
 
03:37:08.389 --> 03:37:08.399 align:start position:0%
are things that need to happen during
 
03:37:09.469 --> 03:37:09.479 align:start position:0%
the election process those who are
 
03:37:11.429 --> 03:37:11.439 align:start position:0%
working are sworn in by the town clerk
 
03:37:14.269 --> 03:37:14.279 align:start position:0%
or by the moderator um you know prior to
 
03:37:16.790 --> 03:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
the uh the election day begin
 
03:37:19.550 --> 03:37:19.560 align:start position:0%
um aside from the additional burden um
 
03:37:21.189 --> 03:37:21.199 align:start position:0%
moderators are elected and trusted
 
03:37:22.950 --> 03:37:22.960 align:start position:0%
there's a reason why it's a nonpartisan
 
03:37:25.030 --> 03:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
office um why people of all parties
 
03:37:28.150 --> 03:37:28.160 align:start position:0%
serve in it um the voters they they
 
03:37:30.710 --> 03:37:30.720 align:start position:0%
elect their moderators and um they trust
 
03:37:32.429 --> 03:37:32.439 align:start position:0%
their moderators or another moderator
 
03:37:33.670 --> 03:37:33.680 align:start position:0%
would run and the voters would replace
 
03:37:35.030 --> 03:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
an existing moderator if they had a
 
03:37:36.550 --> 03:37:36.560 align:start position:0%
problem with the way that they were um
 
03:37:38.189 --> 03:37:38.199 align:start position:0%
conducting their business and running
 
03:37:39.630 --> 03:37:39.640 align:start position:0%
the election of a community whether it
 
03:37:41.870 --> 03:37:41.880 align:start position:0%
was a local election um or a state
 
03:37:43.950 --> 03:37:43.960 align:start position:0%
election um additionally I just want to
 
03:37:46.429 --> 03:37:46.439 align:start position:0%
flag that there are party poll Watchers
 
03:37:47.870 --> 03:37:47.880 align:start position:0%
um and this is a very public process in
 
03:37:49.429 --> 03:37:49.439 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire so if you are
 
03:37:51.590 --> 03:37:51.600 align:start position:0%
a Republican and you have a problem and
 
03:37:52.870 --> 03:37:52.880 align:start position:0%
believe that you'd like to watch the
 
03:37:55.070 --> 03:37:55.080 align:start position:0%
process closely you can and um vote
 
03:37:57.389 --> 03:37:57.399 align:start position:0%
challenges can happen too so the
 
03:38:00.030 --> 03:38:00.040 align:start position:0%
moderator has to do all this publicly
 
03:38:02.710 --> 03:38:02.720 align:start position:0%
it's subjected to public scrutiny and um
 
03:38:04.790 --> 03:38:04.800 align:start position:0%
either party that's on the ballot is
 
03:38:07.229 --> 03:38:07.239 align:start position:0%
allowed to have a point poll Watchers at
 
03:38:09.550 --> 03:38:09.560 align:start position:0%
the polling place um so for those
 
03:38:11.630 --> 03:38:11.640 align:start position:0%
reasons um and because of these
 
03:38:13.590 --> 03:38:13.600 align:start position:0%
additional burdens um we are currently
 
03:38:16.309 --> 03:38:16.319 align:start position:0%
opposed to house po 474 and I'd be happy
 
03:38:18.710 --> 03:38:18.720 align:start position:0%
to take any questions if you have any
 
03:38:20.950 --> 03:38:20.960 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions from the
 
03:38:23.429 --> 03:38:23.439 align:start position:0%
committee seeing Oh representative
 
03:38:25.550 --> 03:38:25.560 align:start position:0%
seeing thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
03:38:28.750 --> 03:38:28.760 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh would it be
 
03:38:32.150 --> 03:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
helpful if the um town could grab an
 
03:38:35.189 --> 03:38:35.199 align:start position:0%
extra computer monitor and plug it in so
 
03:38:36.990 --> 03:38:37.000 align:start position:0%
that more people can see another screen
 
03:38:40.349 --> 03:38:40.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:42.950 --> 03:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
screen I don't know what the thank you
 
03:38:44.189 --> 03:38:44.199 align:start position:0%
for the question representative I don't
 
03:38:45.630 --> 03:38:45.640 align:start position:0%
know what the size of the screen is and
 
03:38:47.269 --> 03:38:47.279 align:start position:0%
I'm not entirely sure what different
 
03:38:50.110 --> 03:38:50.120 align:start position:0%
moderators do specifically um currently
 
03:38:51.950 --> 03:38:51.960 align:start position:0%
at their different uh you know their
 
03:38:55.030 --> 03:38:55.040 align:start position:0%
their election their polling places um
 
03:38:58.309 --> 03:38:58.319 align:start position:0%
you know to ensure um public scrutiny of
 
03:38:59.910 --> 03:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
the process but I would you know i'
 
03:39:01.389 --> 03:39:01.399 align:start position:0%
would be hard pressed that a moderator
 
03:39:03.510 --> 03:39:03.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't let a pull Watcher or someone
 
03:39:05.349 --> 03:39:05.359 align:start position:0%
who's like a ballot clerk be able to
 
03:39:07.469 --> 03:39:07.479 align:start position:0%
watch that process um typically you know
 
03:39:09.030 --> 03:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
the the right and votes are accounted by
 
03:39:10.910 --> 03:39:10.920 align:start position:0%
ballot clerks um you know at the end
 
03:39:12.510 --> 03:39:12.520 align:start position:0%
they count all the uh different how many
 
03:39:14.349 --> 03:39:14.359 align:start position:0%
wrin there were and make sure everything
 
03:39:16.269 --> 03:39:16.279 align:start position:0%
adds up so in the moderators it's their
 
03:39:18.870 --> 03:39:18.880 align:start position:0%
job to interpret write and vote what the
 
03:39:20.790 --> 03:39:20.800 align:start position:0%
intent of that vote was um who the vote
 
03:39:23.910 --> 03:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
was for so we've seen AR rise of people
 
03:39:25.590 --> 03:39:25.600 align:start position:0%
writing in votes for candidates who are
 
03:39:27.189 --> 03:39:27.199 align:start position:0%
already on the ballot because they would
 
03:39:29.389 --> 03:39:29.399 align:start position:0%
like to force a hand count vote for
 
03:39:30.550 --> 03:39:30.560 align:start position:0%
those ballots and usually it's the
 
03:39:33.189 --> 03:39:33.199 align:start position:0%
moderators going through um the wenss of
 
03:39:34.269 --> 03:39:34.279 align:start position:0%
candidates that are already on the
 
03:39:36.550 --> 03:39:36.560 align:start position:0%
ballot and basically saying yep that
 
03:39:38.389 --> 03:39:38.399 align:start position:0%
that vote does count indeed for this
 
03:39:39.910 --> 03:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
candidate that's on the ballot even
 
03:39:41.830 --> 03:39:41.840 align:start position:0%
though it was a right end and um making
 
03:39:43.269 --> 03:39:43.279 align:start position:0%
sure that everyone's vote is counted
 
03:39:45.790 --> 03:39:45.800 align:start position:0%
during the process
 
03:39:48.389 --> 03:39:48.399 align:start position:0%
followup absolutely
 
03:39:51.950 --> 03:39:51.960 align:start position:0%
um as as I understand it the uh computer
 
03:39:53.510 --> 03:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
that comes with the voting machine at
 
03:39:55.510 --> 03:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
least for the voting Works machine is
 
03:39:58.309 --> 03:39:58.319 align:start position:0%
just a small laptop so it's kind of hard
 
03:40:00.309 --> 03:40:00.319 align:start position:0%
to crowd a bunch of people around and
 
03:40:01.990 --> 03:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
look over the shoulder of the moderator
 
03:40:06.550 --> 03:40:06.560 align:start position:0%
while he's doing that okay um thank you
 
03:40:08.229 --> 03:40:08.239 align:start position:0%
representative further questions from
 
03:40:08.239 --> 03:40:09.429 align:start position:0%
representative further questions from
the

03:40:09.429 --> 03:40:09.439 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:40:11.590 --> 03:40:11.600 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
03:40:13.389 --> 03:40:13.399 align:start position:0%
Gilmore thank
 
03:40:19.349 --> 03:40:19.359 align:start position:0%
you um as a mo moderator um and uh who
 
03:40:23.030 --> 03:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
was 12 years now
 
03:40:27.349 --> 03:40:27.359 align:start position:0%
um I always assign my ballot clerks to
 
03:40:30.510 --> 03:40:30.520 align:start position:0%
do the counting of the writing vote so
 
03:40:32.990 --> 03:40:33.000 align:start position:0%
we our machine um doesn't have that
 
03:40:35.030 --> 03:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
digital process hopefully next time it
 
03:40:38.630 --> 03:40:38.640 align:start position:0%
will um so we have to do it by hand um
 
03:40:41.150 --> 03:40:41.160 align:start position:0%
so do I understand this bill to say that
 
03:40:43.189 --> 03:40:43.199 align:start position:0%
now I have to have all those writing
 
03:40:45.750 --> 03:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
people to would have to have an a member
 
03:40:47.389 --> 03:40:47.399 align:start position:0%
of the other party I don't even know the
 
03:40:51.269 --> 03:40:51.279 align:start position:0%
party of my pow workers um I don't know
 
03:40:53.750 --> 03:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
I just I'm sorry I guess I'm really just
 
03:40:57.229 --> 03:40:57.239 align:start position:0%
s just talking sorry but is that your
 
03:40:58.590 --> 03:40:58.600 align:start position:0%
understanding too or there you go there
 
03:40:58.600 --> 03:41:00.110 align:start position:0%
understanding too or there you go there
you

03:41:00.110 --> 03:41:00.120 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:41:04.510 --> 03:41:04.520 align:start position:0%
go um the first one's free yeah I was G
 
03:41:06.590 --> 03:41:06.600 align:start position:0%
um this specifically cites um ballot
 
03:41:08.910 --> 03:41:08.920 align:start position:0%
counting device um so I would assume it
 
03:41:11.030 --> 03:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
would only account in those situations
 
03:41:12.910 --> 03:41:12.920 align:start position:0%
where a municipality is using a ballot
 
03:41:15.630 --> 03:41:15.640 align:start position:0%
counting device um that would my
 
03:41:18.590 --> 03:41:18.600 align:start position:0%
interpretation say
 
03:41:20.790 --> 03:41:20.800 align:start position:0%
printed you got to ask for a follow I'm
 
03:41:23.510 --> 03:41:23.520 align:start position:0%

03:41:52.229 --> 03:41:52.239 align:start position:0%
anyway good afternoon everyone Ain
 
03:41:53.790 --> 03:41:53.800 align:start position:0%
Hennessy I'm the deputy secretary of
 
03:41:57.389 --> 03:41:57.399 align:start position:0%
state so the legislation before you uh
 
03:42:00.030 --> 03:42:00.040 align:start position:0%
strictly applies to the electronic Bal
 
03:42:01.630 --> 03:42:01.640 align:start position:0%
accounting devices that digitally
 
03:42:04.630 --> 03:42:04.640 align:start position:0%
display or print write-ins right now in
 
03:42:06.309 --> 03:42:06.319 align:start position:0%
the state we only have one device that
 
03:42:08.030 --> 03:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
does this this is the voting Works
 
03:42:11.469 --> 03:42:11.479 align:start position:0%
device um in March it'll be
 
03:42:15.429 --> 03:42:15.439 align:start position:0%
in it grows every day I want to say for
 
03:42:17.710 --> 03:42:17.720 align:start position:0%
polling places um at March toown
 
03:42:19.750 --> 03:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
elections that's just an estimate right
 
03:42:22.990 --> 03:42:23.000 align:start position:0%
now and in the training process for
 
03:42:25.630 --> 03:42:25.640 align:start position:0%
moderators and anyone who um learns
 
03:42:28.189 --> 03:42:28.199 align:start position:0%
about the voting Works device we train
 
03:42:29.950 --> 03:42:29.960 align:start position:0%
that when they do the adjudication
 
03:42:32.349 --> 03:42:32.359 align:start position:0%
process of the write-ins which does come
 
03:42:34.870 --> 03:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
up on a laptop screen um as
 
03:42:37.110 --> 03:42:37.120 align:start position:0%
representative C did mention that they
 
03:42:39.830 --> 03:42:39.840 align:start position:0%
are to do that in pairs so what someone
 
03:42:41.870 --> 03:42:41.880 align:start position:0%
does the typing and someone confirms
 
03:42:43.590 --> 03:42:43.600 align:start position:0%
that what was typed is what was written
 
03:42:47.149 --> 03:42:47.159 align:start position:0%
on the screen um this is very similar to
 
03:42:49.070 --> 03:42:49.080 align:start position:0%
the process that is used for paper
 
03:42:50.870 --> 03:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
ballots when they look at a write in
 
03:42:52.229 --> 03:42:52.239 align:start position:0%
where there's two people working
 
03:42:55.670 --> 03:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
together um they're not done in um silos
 
03:42:57.630 --> 03:42:57.640 align:start position:0%
where just one person calculates the
 
03:43:01.870 --> 03:43:01.880 align:start position:0%
total rins um so it's a team process um
 
03:43:04.510 --> 03:43:04.520 align:start position:0%
I do I am not opposed to putting in law
 
03:43:07.389 --> 03:43:07.399 align:start position:0%
that it be a team process however um the
 
03:43:10.030 --> 03:43:10.040 align:start position:0%
moderator is a non-partisan elected
 
03:43:12.870 --> 03:43:12.880 align:start position:0%
official um and as it has been mentioned
 
03:43:16.030 --> 03:43:16.040 align:start position:0%
um does not run as a um as a member of a
 
03:43:20.070 --> 03:43:20.080 align:start position:0%
party they may be Undeclared voter um
 
03:43:23.510 --> 03:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
and so the term opposing party would be
 
03:43:25.950 --> 03:43:25.960 align:start position:0%
difficult in a lot of situations and
 
03:43:28.790 --> 03:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
also politicize the moderator um which
 
03:43:32.070 --> 03:43:32.080 align:start position:0%
we don't want to see in an election um
 
03:43:34.429 --> 03:43:34.439 align:start position:0%
so I would just recommend some language
 
03:43:37.910 --> 03:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
changes there um but in in regards to
 
03:43:40.229 --> 03:43:40.239 align:start position:0%
having two people do it we do currently
 
03:43:42.349 --> 03:43:42.359 align:start position:0%
train to that the moderator does have
 
03:43:44.389 --> 03:43:44.399 align:start position:0%
the ability to assign this to someone
 
03:43:45.910 --> 03:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
else so it's not necessarily the
 
03:43:47.910 --> 03:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
moderator who is typing in on the
 
03:43:50.429 --> 03:43:50.439 align:start position:0%
computer it may be one of her or his
 
03:43:52.429 --> 03:43:52.439 align:start position:0%
assistants doing this so I just want to
 
03:43:53.670 --> 03:43:53.680 align:start position:0%
make it clear it's not always the
 
03:43:56.070 --> 03:43:56.080 align:start position:0%
moderator doing it um they are a
 
03:43:58.149 --> 03:43:58.159 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan election official and we
 
03:43:59.870 --> 03:43:59.880 align:start position:0%
currently do train to
 
03:44:02.070 --> 03:44:02.080 align:start position:0%
this will you be taking questions I'm
 
03:44:03.670 --> 03:44:03.680 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions are there
 
03:44:05.110 --> 03:44:05.120 align:start position:0%
represent gimar uh preemptive you want
 
03:44:06.990 --> 03:44:07.000 align:start position:0%
to turn your mic off or oh thank you
 
03:44:10.870 --> 03:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
yeah because things happen um questions
 
03:44:12.149 --> 03:44:12.159 align:start position:0%
from the committee for the deputy
 
03:44:13.870 --> 03:44:13.880 align:start position:0%
secretary representative we you look
 
03:44:13.880 --> 03:44:15.510 align:start position:0%
secretary representative we you look
intrigued

03:44:15.510 --> 03:44:15.520 align:start position:0%
intrigued
 
03:44:17.910 --> 03:44:17.920 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair thank you deputy
 
03:44:20.550 --> 03:44:20.560 align:start position:0%
secretary for taking my question so um
 
03:44:23.910 --> 03:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
there is a paragraph in 659 63 about
 
03:44:26.750 --> 03:44:26.760 align:start position:0%
counting to be public um
 
03:44:30.070 --> 03:44:30.080 align:start position:0%
perhaps uh
 
03:44:30.080 --> 03:44:31.590 align:start position:0%
perhaps uh
659

03:44:31.590 --> 03:44:31.600 align:start position:0%
659
 
03:44:36.229 --> 03:44:36.239 align:start position:0%
64a uh could be amended to convey
 
03:44:40.309 --> 03:44:40.319 align:start position:0%
that the counting of these um right-end
 
03:44:43.670 --> 03:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
vote should follow the principles
 
03:44:46.550 --> 03:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
outlined in 659 63 although it may be
 
03:44:48.670 --> 03:44:48.680 align:start position:0%
implied I'm not sure but
 
03:44:51.830 --> 03:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
um um got to get to a question yes is
 
03:44:55.469 --> 03:44:55.479 align:start position:0%
that you know would you see do you see
 
03:44:59.349 --> 03:44:59.359 align:start position:0%
this counting in 6 in 65964 a consistent
 
03:45:01.910 --> 03:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
with the counting to be public within
 
03:45:04.630 --> 03:45:04.640 align:start position:0%
659 63 I think that would be actually
 
03:45:07.349 --> 03:45:07.359 align:start position:0%
the appropriate question thank you for
 
03:45:08.590 --> 03:45:08.600 align:start position:0%
the question representative I didn't
 
03:45:10.590 --> 03:45:10.600 align:start position:0%
bring my law book so if you are seeing
 
03:45:12.469 --> 03:45:12.479 align:start position:0%
that that is the exact statute where it
 
03:45:15.149 --> 03:45:15.159 align:start position:0%
requires public counting then yes they
 
03:45:18.550 --> 03:45:18.560 align:start position:0%
would this already has to be done in
 
03:45:21.710 --> 03:45:21.720 align:start position:0%
public okay thank you further questions
 
03:45:24.670 --> 03:45:24.680 align:start position:0%
from the committee seeing none thank you
 
03:45:25.790 --> 03:45:25.800 align:start position:0%
thank you I don't believe I have any
 
03:45:28.309 --> 03:45:28.319 align:start position:0%
more pain cards um
 
03:45:31.870 --> 03:45:31.880 align:start position:0%
representative gusowski gusowski I'm
 
03:45:35.229 --> 03:45:35.239 align:start position:0%
getting worse I'm I'm trying I'm I'm I'm
 
03:45:39.149 --> 03:45:39.159 align:start position:0%
trying real hard just be consistent
 
03:45:42.229 --> 03:45:42.239 align:start position:0%
yeah I I I should just yeah just just
 
03:45:43.590 --> 03:45:43.600 align:start position:0%
let it fly or or I could just just
 
03:45:45.710 --> 03:45:45.720 align:start position:0%
butcher it in a way that's just
 
03:45:51.269 --> 03:45:51.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:54.790 --> 03:45:54.800 align:start position:0%
Smith um there was no one signed up uh
 
03:45:56.070 --> 03:45:56.080 align:start position:0%
who did not
 
03:45:56.080 --> 03:45:58.030 align:start position:0%
who did not
speak

03:45:58.030 --> 03:45:58.040 align:start position:0%
speak
 
03:46:01.070 --> 03:46:01.080 align:start position:0%
online where did it go um online there
 
03:46:03.110 --> 03:46:03.120 align:start position:0%
were four in support six in opposition
 
03:46:05.429 --> 03:46:05.439 align:start position:0%
and with that I will close the public
 
03:46:09.750 --> 03:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill
 
03:46:14.389 --> 03:46:14.399 align:start position:0%
474 um we've got 10 we've got five
 
03:46:14.399 --> 03:46:15.590 align:start position:0%
474 um we've got 10 we've got five
minutes

03:46:15.590 --> 03:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
03:46:17.149 --> 03:46:17.159 align:start position:0%
so I would like to we're not going to
 
03:46:20.389 --> 03:46:20.399 align:start position:0%
take a vote but I would like to uh go
 
03:46:21.990 --> 03:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
into executive section for the purpose
 
03:46:22.000 --> 03:46:23.710 align:start position:0%
into executive section for the purpose
of

03:46:23.710 --> 03:46:23.720 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:46:27.149 --> 03:46:27.159 align:start position:0%
discussing uh where is
 
03:46:30.550 --> 03:46:30.560 align:start position:0%
it uh 327 which we heard earlier today
 
03:46:33.269 --> 03:46:33.279 align:start position:0%
that's the that's the one about signing
 
03:46:34.630 --> 03:46:34.640 align:start position:0%
up at the Secretary of State's office I
 
03:46:36.110 --> 03:46:36.120 align:start position:0%
just like to get the committee's feel on
 
03:46:39.110 --> 03:46:39.120 align:start position:0%
it we're not taking a vote but so um I'm
 
03:46:40.870 --> 03:46:40.880 align:start position:0%
going to open up the executive section
 
03:46:43.110 --> 03:46:43.120 align:start position:0%
for House Bill 327 FN relative to fine
 
03:46:45.590 --> 03:46:45.600 align:start position:0%
for office and witnessing affidavits um
 
03:46:48.510 --> 03:46:48.520 align:start position:0%
does anybody have any comments on this I
 
03:46:49.990 --> 03:46:50.000 align:start position:0%
think I made my position pretty clear
 
03:46:51.070 --> 03:46:51.080 align:start position:0%
which is I
 
03:46:53.309 --> 03:46:53.319 align:start position:0%
think anyone should be able to do this
 
03:46:56.429 --> 03:46:56.439 align:start position:0%
for any for for State Rep um does anyone
 
03:46:58.269 --> 03:46:58.279 align:start position:0%

that Amendment forward when we actually
 
03:47:02.349 --> 03:47:02.359 align:start position:0%
execute but does anybody else have any
 
03:47:04.429 --> 03:47:04.439 align:start position:0%
comments on
 
03:47:08.349 --> 03:47:08.359 align:start position:0%
that representative C I kind of agree
 
03:47:11.510 --> 03:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
with the idea of just saying the uh uh
 
03:47:13.149 --> 03:47:13.159 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office can take
 
03:47:16.349 --> 03:47:16.359 align:start position:0%

03:47:19.309 --> 03:47:19.319 align:start position:0%

with that I'll close the um executive
session

03:47:56.030 --> 03:47:56.040 align:start position:0%
session
 
03:47:58.710 --> 03:47:58.720 align:start position:0%
on 3:27 I guess I'm technically
 
03:48:00.990 --> 03:48:01.000 align:start position:0%
recessing it so recessing the executive
 
03:48:03.389 --> 03:48:03.399 align:start position:0%
session for it um anything else we want
 
03:48:04.050 --> 03:48:04.060 align:start position:0%
to talk
 
03:48:04.060 --> 03:48:06.110 align:start position:0%
to talk
[Music]

03:48:06.110 --> 03:48:06.120 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:48:08.309 --> 03:48:08.319 align:start position:0%
about oh let's talk about well we have a
 
03:48:09.510 --> 03:48:09.520 align:start position:0%
second I'm gonna open up the executive
 
03:48:12.830 --> 03:48:12.840 align:start position:0%
session for House Bill 626 directing the
 
03:48:13.830 --> 03:48:13.840 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State to implement a
 
03:48:15.510 --> 03:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
vulnerability disclos osure program for
 
03:48:18.189 --> 03:48:18.199 align:start position:0%
certain electronic systems um I believe
 
03:48:21.149 --> 03:48:21.159 align:start position:0%
I have in my notes that the secretary
 
03:48:23.510 --> 03:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
was in support yeah he's in suppor of
 
03:48:26.710 --> 03:48:26.720 align:start position:0%
the idea but he wants a provision about
 
03:48:28.670 --> 03:48:28.680 align:start position:0%
if a problem is discovered they're able
 
03:48:32.229 --> 03:48:32.239 align:start position:0%
to fix it first um which seems very
 
03:48:33.790 --> 03:48:33.800 align:start position:0%
reasonable to me if the secretary States
 
03:48:36.429 --> 03:48:36.439 align:start position:0%
in support of it um I I I also think the
 
03:48:38.189 --> 03:48:38.199 align:start position:0%
secretary's concern is very reasonable
 
03:48:40.229 --> 03:48:40.239 align:start position:0%
which is hey if we do this and we find
 
03:48:41.269 --> 03:48:41.279 align:start position:0%
something we probably shouldn't tell
 
03:48:43.149 --> 03:48:43.159 align:start position:0%
people before we fix it um I think
 
03:48:44.790 --> 03:48:44.800 align:start position:0%
that's actually pretty reasonable um
 
03:48:46.830 --> 03:48:46.840 align:start position:0%
does anybody have any comments about
 
03:48:49.710 --> 03:48:49.720 align:start position:0%
that they'd like to opine
 
03:48:53.349 --> 03:48:53.359 align:start position:0%
on yes representative toner um I agree
 
03:48:56.269 --> 03:48:56.279 align:start position:0%
with that the only time or the question
 
03:48:57.510 --> 03:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
that I would have with that is if
 
03:48:59.269 --> 03:48:59.279 align:start position:0%
there's any type of breach that happens
 
03:49:01.710 --> 03:49:01.720 align:start position:0%
there is rsas associated with publicly
 
03:49:04.070 --> 03:49:04.080 align:start position:0%
announcing breaches so I don't know if
 
03:49:06.070 --> 03:49:06.080 align:start position:0%
that would conflict with that or not
 
03:49:06.080 --> 03:49:07.110 align:start position:0%
that would conflict with that or not
might

03:49:07.110 --> 03:49:07.120 align:start position:0%
might
 
03:49:09.189 --> 03:49:09.199 align:start position:0%
not yeah that's that's an interesting
 
03:49:12.710 --> 03:49:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:15.189 --> 03:49:15.199 align:start position:0%
breaches okay um any other questions
 
03:49:15.199 --> 03:49:16.429 align:start position:0%
breaches okay um any other questions
comments

03:49:16.429 --> 03:49:16.439 align:start position:0%
comments
 
03:49:18.550 --> 03:49:18.560 align:start position:0%
concerns on
 
03:49:20.750 --> 03:49:20.760 align:start position:0%
this okay represent toner do you think
 
03:49:23.590 --> 03:49:23.600 align:start position:0%
you can look into that with that r i I
 
03:49:25.389 --> 03:49:25.399 align:start position:0%
have no clue about that RSA so I I
 
03:49:26.870 --> 03:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
anything I say
 
03:49:30.510 --> 03:49:30.520 align:start position:0%
is conjecture so yeah I'd be happy too
 
03:49:33.309 --> 03:49:33.319 align:start position:0%
i' and I can send it to you but um it
 
03:49:35.389 --> 03:49:35.399 align:start position:0%
might need a review by the secretary
 
03:49:37.229 --> 03:49:37.239 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah it's fine yeah was well it's
 
03:49:40.830 --> 03:49:40.840 align:start position:0%
not it's not an early bill so um okay
 
03:49:43.269 --> 03:49:43.279 align:start position:0%
any other anyone anyone else wish to app
 
03:49:44.189 --> 03:49:44.199 align:start position:0%
on that I just want to kind of get where
 
03:49:47.309 --> 03:49:47.319 align:start position:0%
people's heads was that so that's
 
03:49:49.590 --> 03:49:49.600 align:start position:0%
fine uh I'll close the exe I'll recess
 
03:49:51.469 --> 03:49:51.479 align:start position:0%
the executive session for 6 House Bill
 
03:49:55.790 --> 03:49:55.800 align:start position:0%

definitely don't have time to begin
 
03:49:59.630 --> 03:49:59.640 align:start position:0%
discussing the signs on property that'll
 
03:50:01.870 --> 03:50:01.880 align:start position:0%
take God knows how long so we won't we
 
03:50:03.149 --> 03:50:03.159 align:start position:0%
won't start that discussion until we
 
03:50:06.870 --> 03:50:06.880 align:start position:0%
hear the next bill because um we have
 
03:50:08.710 --> 03:50:08.720 align:start position:0%

won't everyone in this room is going to
 
03:50:12.590 --> 03:50:12.600 align:start position:0%
have a different standard for what
 
03:50:13.590 --> 03:50:13.600 align:start position:0%
that's going to be so that'll be
 
03:50:15.070 --> 03:50:15.080 align:start position:0%
interesting to watch that sort all right
 
03:50:16.950 --> 03:50:16.960 align:start position:0%
I'll see you guys in uh basically I
 
03:50:43.630 --> 03:50:43.640 align:start position:0%

03:52:04.309 --> 03:52:04.319 align:start position:0%
an
 
03:52:06.710 --> 03:52:06.720 align:start position:0%
Alum alumnus of the committee
 
03:52:07.790 --> 03:52:07.800 align:start position:0%

03:52:14.870 --> 03:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
good to be back I'm representative Heath
 
03:52:16.550 --> 03:52:16.560 align:start position:0%
Howard I represent the towns of straford
 
03:52:19.149 --> 03:52:19.159 align:start position:0%
and barington and straford District 4 uh
 
03:52:21.750 --> 03:52:21.760 align:start position:0%
today I'm introducing HB
 
03:52:25.349 --> 03:52:25.359 align:start position:0%
389 and it's a pretty simple bill it
 
03:52:27.990 --> 03:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
requires uh anybody who doesn't spend or
 
03:52:31.070 --> 03:52:31.080 align:start position:0%
receive $1,000 in an election period to
 
03:52:35.309 --> 03:52:35.319 align:start position:0%
still file uh the thing is is in 2022 we
 
03:52:35.319 --> 03:52:36.189 align:start position:0%
still file uh the thing is is in 2022 we
had

03:52:36.189 --> 03:52:36.199 align:start position:0%
had
 
03:52:39.590 --> 03:52:39.600 align:start position:0%
418 out of 893 state representative
 
03:52:41.349 --> 03:52:41.359 align:start position:0%
candidates who did not file a single
 
03:52:45.030 --> 03:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
report that's 47% of everybody who ran
 
03:52:47.990 --> 03:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh and we had nine out of 65 Senate
 
03:52:49.750 --> 03:52:49.760 align:start position:0%
candidates that's
 
03:52:52.750 --> 03:52:52.760 align:start position:0%
14% so we had a significant amount of
 
03:52:55.110 --> 03:52:55.120 align:start position:0%
people who didn't submit any sort of
 
03:52:55.120 --> 03:52:56.550 align:start position:0%
people who didn't submit any sort of
financial

03:52:56.550 --> 03:52:56.560 align:start position:0%
financial
 
03:52:58.870 --> 03:52:58.880 align:start position:0%
disclosure the thing is is that right
 
03:53:00.710 --> 03:53:00.720 align:start position:0%
now because of the way that our paper
 
03:53:04.030 --> 03:53:04.040 align:start position:0%
filing Works uh you don't necessarily
 
03:53:06.269 --> 03:53:06.279 align:start position:0%
need to file a paper report but if you
 
03:53:08.910 --> 03:53:08.920 align:start position:0%
go on to the online system instead you
 
03:53:10.870 --> 03:53:10.880 align:start position:0%
have to file everything sequentially
 
03:53:13.550 --> 03:53:13.560 align:start position:0%
meaning that you have to check off a
 
03:53:14.990 --> 03:53:15.000 align:start position:0%
little check box that says that you
 
03:53:16.790 --> 03:53:16.800 align:start position:0%
attest that you did not spend or receive
 
03:53:18.870 --> 03:53:18.880 align:start position:0%
over $1,000 in that
 
03:53:22.070 --> 03:53:22.080 align:start position:0%
period this would just make sure that
 
03:53:24.710 --> 03:53:24.720 align:start position:0%
the process is the same it would ensure
 
03:53:26.870 --> 03:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
compliance across the board make sure
 
03:53:28.990 --> 03:53:29.000 align:start position:0%
that every single candidate is just
 
03:53:30.670 --> 03:53:30.680 align:start position:0%
checking off a little box if they didn't
 
03:53:33.590 --> 03:53:33.600 align:start position:0%
receive that or spend
 
03:53:36.750 --> 03:53:36.760 align:start position:0%
$1,000 uh that being said uh because
 
03:53:38.830 --> 03:53:38.840 align:start position:0%
it's a fairly simple Bill uh I'm open to
 
03:53:41.590 --> 03:53:41.600 align:start position:0%
any questions thank you questions from
 
03:53:41.600 --> 03:53:42.710 align:start position:0%
any questions thank you questions from
the

03:53:42.710 --> 03:53:42.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:53:45.389 --> 03:53:45.399 align:start position:0%
committee well that was easy okay thank
 
03:53:47.950 --> 03:53:47.960 align:start position:0%
you representative Howard um thank you I
 
03:53:49.110 --> 03:53:49.120 align:start position:0%
thought at least somebody asked a
 
03:53:53.590 --> 03:53:53.600 align:start position:0%
question so let's go through here um
 
03:53:58.950 --> 03:53:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:00.910 --> 03:54:00.920 align:start position:0%
Hennessy thank you Mr chair good
 
03:54:04.149 --> 03:54:04.159 align:start position:0%
afternoon everyone um I will leave it to
 
03:54:05.630 --> 03:54:05.640 align:start position:0%
the committee whether you think this is
 
03:54:07.670 --> 03:54:07.680 align:start position:0%
a good idea or not but I just want to
 
03:54:10.110 --> 03:54:10.120 align:start position:0%
talk about a few um technical aspects of
 
03:54:12.630 --> 03:54:12.640 align:start position:0%
the bill first of all our system is
 
03:54:14.149 --> 03:54:14.159 align:start position:0%
capable of doing that so that's good
 
03:54:15.870 --> 03:54:15.880 align:start position:0%
there's not a huge fiscal note attached
 
03:54:19.269 --> 03:54:19.279 align:start position:0%
to this um as the representative said
 
03:54:21.870 --> 03:54:21.880 align:start position:0%
these are um already in the system
 
03:54:24.750 --> 03:54:24.760 align:start position:0%
they're called no activity reports um
 
03:54:26.790 --> 03:54:26.800 align:start position:0%
one thing I just do want to point out is
 
03:54:30.110 --> 03:54:30.120 align:start position:0%
that the language in lines 14 through 15
 
03:54:32.590 --> 03:54:32.600 align:start position:0%
is repeated language that's already
 
03:54:35.189 --> 03:54:35.199 align:start position:0%
mentioned above so I would just say pick
 
03:54:36.469 --> 03:54:36.479 align:start position:0%
or choose where you would want that
 
03:54:38.349 --> 03:54:38.359 align:start position:0%
language but just say it once for
 
03:54:41.429 --> 03:54:41.439 align:start position:0%
clarifi just to clarify for our office
 
03:54:44.670 --> 03:54:44.680 align:start position:0%
also we would look for clarification
 
03:54:50.070 --> 03:54:50.080 align:start position:0%
about the language on um expenditures so
 
03:54:52.149 --> 03:54:52.159 align:start position:0%
on line eight it says candidates whose
 
03:54:54.349 --> 03:54:54.359 align:start position:0%
expenditures do not exceed
 
03:54:57.870 --> 03:54:57.880 align:start position:0%
$1,000 however on um the proceeding
 
03:55:01.269 --> 03:55:01.279 align:start position:0%
lines they are receipts or expenditures
 
03:55:03.110 --> 03:55:03.120 align:start position:0%
so if you're if you're L just looking
 
03:55:05.110 --> 03:55:05.120 align:start position:0%
for expenditures I would say that it
 
03:55:07.189 --> 03:55:07.199 align:start position:0%
might be a little confusing to those
 
03:55:09.110 --> 03:55:09.120 align:start position:0%
candidates if they're supposed to file
 
03:55:12.349 --> 03:55:12.359 align:start position:0%
receipts or expenditures or one of the
 
03:55:14.870 --> 03:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
other or for both um I believe this
 
03:55:17.670 --> 03:55:17.680 align:start position:0%
language was changed in HB 1091 that
 
03:55:19.670 --> 03:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
came on of this committee last year that
 
03:55:22.309 --> 03:55:22.319 align:start position:0%
it required receipts or
 
03:55:24.510 --> 03:55:24.520 align:start position:0%
expenditures happy to take questions
 
03:55:26.550 --> 03:55:26.560 align:start position:0%
okay questions from the
 
03:55:30.110 --> 03:55:30.120 align:start position:0%
committee okay saying none thank you um
 
03:55:33.990 --> 03:55:34.000 align:start position:0%
next up is uh
 
03:55:40.429 --> 03:55:40.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:47.070 --> 03:55:47.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:49.349 --> 03:55:49.359 align:start position:0%
um hi thank you chairman and members of
 
03:55:51.950 --> 03:55:51.960 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Kaye of stadio
 
03:55:53.870 --> 03:55:53.880 align:start position:0%
um but today I am going to be
 
03:55:55.910 --> 03:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
representing Bob Perry a former member
 
03:55:58.510 --> 03:55:58.520 align:start position:0%
of this committee and also he serves on
 
03:56:01.950 --> 03:56:01.960 align:start position:0%
the board of open democracy which is a
 
03:56:05.670 --> 03:56:05.680 align:start position:0%
nonprofit um so he says I am out of
 
03:56:07.429 --> 03:56:07.439 align:start position:0%
state please do not construe my
 
03:56:09.149 --> 03:56:09.159 align:start position:0%
non-appearance as a lack of interest in
 
03:56:11.269 --> 03:56:11.279 align:start position:0%
the bill first and foremost my
 
03:56:12.910 --> 03:56:12.920 align:start position:0%
experience while serving on the election
 
03:56:14.750 --> 03:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
law committee years ago in informs me
 
03:56:16.950 --> 03:56:16.960 align:start position:0%
that describing any bill as simple is
 
03:56:19.070 --> 03:56:19.080 align:start position:0%
folly however I'm willing to say the
 
03:56:21.550 --> 03:56:21.560 align:start position:0%
intent behind the bill is a simple one
 
03:56:23.510 --> 03:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
it is to minimize the cynicism and
 
03:56:25.389 --> 03:56:25.399 align:start position:0%
speculation over why such a high
 
03:56:27.389 --> 03:56:27.399 align:start position:0%
percentage of candidates do not file
 
03:56:30.550 --> 03:56:30.560 align:start position:0%
Financial reports as required by Statute
 
03:56:34.469 --> 03:56:34.479 align:start position:0%
I'm aware that as of December 16th 2024
 
03:56:37.030 --> 03:56:37.040 align:start position:0%
313 house candidates did not file
 
03:56:40.349 --> 03:56:40.359 align:start position:0%
Financial reports for the 2024 election
 
03:56:42.710 --> 03:56:42.720 align:start position:0%
norded six Senate candidates one
 
03:56:44.790 --> 03:56:44.800 align:start position:0%
executive Council candidate
 
03:56:47.950 --> 03:56:47.960 align:start position:0%
and it is reasonable to ask why while I
 
03:56:49.389 --> 03:56:49.399 align:start position:0%
strongly disagree with the scotus
 
03:56:52.070 --> 03:56:52.080 align:start position:0%
decision and citizens united I strongly
 
03:56:53.590 --> 03:56:53.600 align:start position:0%
agree with its observation that
 
03:56:55.429 --> 03:56:55.439 align:start position:0%
disclosure of political spending is
 
03:56:57.670 --> 03:56:57.680 align:start position:0%
crucial to the public interest and in
 
03:57:00.550 --> 03:57:00.560 align:start position:0%
the preservation of democracy indeed
 
03:57:02.309 --> 03:57:02.319 align:start position:0%
courts since Buckley have upheld the
 
03:57:04.469 --> 03:57:04.479 align:start position:0%
legality and importance of transparency
 
03:57:07.389 --> 03:57:07.399 align:start position:0%
in the political realm the bill require
 
03:57:09.309 --> 03:57:09.319 align:start position:0%
the placement of a check box to be added
 
03:57:11.469 --> 03:57:11.479 align:start position:0%
to the existing reporting forms both
 
03:57:13.630 --> 03:57:13.640 align:start position:0%
online and handwritten by which
 
03:57:15.550 --> 03:57:15.560 align:start position:0%
candidates would affir affirm that their
 
03:57:17.590 --> 03:57:17.600 align:start position:0%
spending was under the applicable
 
03:57:20.110 --> 03:57:20.120 align:start position:0%
threshold during each reporting period
 
03:57:21.510 --> 03:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
this affirmation would negate the
 
03:57:24.030 --> 03:57:24.040 align:start position:0%
reasonable skepticism and concerns over
 
03:57:25.870 --> 03:57:25.880 align:start position:0%
why such a high percentage of reports
 
03:57:28.469 --> 03:57:28.479 align:start position:0%
are not being filed is it really because
 
03:57:30.830 --> 03:57:30.840 align:start position:0%
they are exempt from filing or is it an
 
03:57:32.710 --> 03:57:32.720 align:start position:0%
intentional disregard for the law an
 
03:57:35.269 --> 03:57:35.279 align:start position:0%
attempt to hide or other various
 
03:57:37.389 --> 03:57:37.399 align:start position:0%
considerations the Supreme Court gave us
 
03:57:39.590 --> 03:57:39.600 align:start position:0%
a few wild checks on Wild West political
 
03:57:41.750 --> 03:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
spending other than to allow spending to
 
03:57:44.349 --> 03:57:44.359 align:start position:0%
be disclosed with the stakes as high as
 
03:57:46.309 --> 03:57:46.319 align:start position:0%
they are the unprecedented amounts of
 
03:57:48.429 --> 03:57:48.439 align:start position:0%
money flowing into presidential and even
 
03:57:50.590 --> 03:57:50.600 align:start position:0%
local elections it becomes more
 
03:57:52.510 --> 03:57:52.520 align:start position:0%
important each election cycle that
 
03:57:54.870 --> 03:57:54.880 align:start position:0%
candidates explain why detailed reports
 
03:57:57.550 --> 03:57:57.560 align:start position:0%
are not required of them a simple check
 
03:57:59.309 --> 03:57:59.319 align:start position:0%
of the Box provides the public with the
 
03:58:01.070 --> 03:58:01.080 align:start position:0%
degree of confidence the law is being
 
03:58:05.990 --> 03:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
followed I urge OTP on HB 389 thank

sheet um good afternoon members of the
 
03:58:39.429 --> 03:58:39.439 align:start position:0%
committee for the record Olivia zinc
 
03:58:40.990 --> 03:58:41.000 align:start position:0%
executive director at open democracy and
 
03:58:43.710 --> 03:58:43.720 align:start position:0%
I I'm a voter in Franklin um I think the
 
03:58:45.750 --> 03:58:45.760 align:start position:0%
best way to describe how this bill works
 
03:58:48.910 --> 03:58:48.920 align:start position:0%
is showand tell so when you file online
 
03:58:51.349 --> 03:58:51.359 align:start position:0%
there's this box here that says no
 
03:58:53.710 --> 03:58:53.720 align:start position:0%
activity report there's been no activity
 
03:58:56.910 --> 03:58:56.920 align:start position:0%
on my campaigns if you file using the
 
03:58:59.910 --> 03:58:59.920 align:start position:0%
paper form there is no said box so the
 
03:59:02.469 --> 03:59:02.479 align:start position:0%
forms are different based on how you
 
03:59:05.110 --> 03:59:05.120 align:start position:0%
file um and I just want to point that
 
03:59:07.630 --> 03:59:07.640 align:start position:0%
out because I think it's important that
 
03:59:09.950 --> 03:59:09.960 align:start position:0%
uh however we report it's consistent
 
03:59:12.349 --> 03:59:12.359 align:start position:0%
based on which which way you report I
 
03:59:14.110 --> 03:59:14.120 align:start position:0%
know that this problem will be solved
 
03:59:16.750 --> 03:59:16.760 align:start position:0%
once everybody files online um which
 
03:59:19.910 --> 03:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
hopefully will happen at some point
 
03:59:22.469 --> 03:59:22.479 align:start position:0%
um the other thing um that I just want
 
03:59:24.429 --> 03:59:24.439 align:start position:0%
to mention that hasn't been mentioned is
 
03:59:26.070 --> 03:59:26.080 align:start position:0%
that I do think that this efficiency
 
03:59:27.830 --> 03:59:27.840 align:start position:0%
will help the Attorney General when
 
03:59:30.710 --> 03:59:30.720 align:start position:0%
they're investigating um who has filed
 
03:59:33.710 --> 03:59:33.720 align:start position:0%
campaign Finance reports um right now we
 
03:59:36.309 --> 03:59:36.319 align:start position:0%
don't know are the is it because
 
03:59:39.309 --> 03:59:39.319 align:start position:0%
candidates didn't file or is it because
 
03:59:41.710 --> 03:59:41.720 align:start position:0%
they didn't report um so I think that's
 
03:59:43.510 --> 03:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
really important um to make sure that
 
03:59:45.110 --> 03:59:45.120 align:start position:0%
there is great G transparency in our
 
03:59:47.750 --> 03:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
campaign Finance I urge a to pass on
 
03:59:51.030 --> 03:59:51.040 align:start position:0%
House Bill 389 um and the other thing
 
03:59:52.670 --> 03:59:52.680 align:start position:0%
that I would just clarify is that if you
 
03:59:54.870 --> 03:59:54.880 align:start position:0%
are amending the language um I think it
 
03:59:57.309 --> 03:59:57.319 align:start position:0%
would be good to just instead of saying
 
03:59:59.149 --> 03:59:59.159 align:start position:0%
there's been no activity since my
 
04:00:01.309 --> 04:00:01.319 align:start position:0%
previous report it's I'm under the
 
04:00:04.790 --> 04:00:04.800 align:start position:0%
threshold for reporting
 
04:00:08.309 --> 04:00:08.319 align:start position:0%
um might might be clearer language too
 
04:00:10.469 --> 04:00:10.479 align:start position:0%
thank you all right will you be taking
 
04:00:12.550 --> 04:00:12.560 align:start position:0%
questions happy to okay are there
 
04:00:15.070 --> 04:00:15.080 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
04:00:16.790 --> 04:00:16.800 align:start position:0%
seeing n thank you um I don't have
 
04:00:18.309 --> 04:00:18.319 align:start position:0%
anyone else signed up to speak or other
 
04:00:20.670 --> 04:00:20.680 align:start position:0%
pink cards is there anyone else present
 
04:00:22.389 --> 04:00:22.399 align:start position:0%
excuse me who wishes to
 
04:00:24.269 --> 04:00:24.279 align:start position:0%
speak I thought that was going to take a
 
04:00:26.189 --> 04:00:26.199 align:start position:0%
lot longer I really this is my first big
 
04:00:28.590 --> 04:00:28.600 align:start position:0%
scheduling mess up for the day I thought
 
04:00:31.550 --> 04:00:31.560 align:start position:0%
that one was going to take a lot longer
 
04:00:34.910 --> 04:00:34.920 align:start position:0%
um so we will close the public hearing
 
04:00:39.590 --> 04:00:39.600 align:start position:0%
on um House Bill
 
04:00:43.309 --> 04:00:43.319 align:start position:0%
589 um 3 389 excuse me uh there was one
 
04:00:45.670 --> 04:00:45.680 align:start position:0%
person signed up who didn't speak Max mo
 
04:00:48.309 --> 04:00:48.319 align:start position:0%
Baxley are you still here did they leave
 
04:00:49.630 --> 04:00:49.640 align:start position:0%
okay they wrote something after it I
 
04:00:54.510 --> 04:00:54.520 align:start position:0%
can't read it um and then 389 online had
 
04:00:56.309 --> 04:00:56.319 align:start position:0%
20 in support one in opposition with
 
04:00:58.149 --> 04:00:58.159 align:start position:0%
that I'll close the public
 
04:01:01.110 --> 04:01:01.120 align:start position:0%
hearing um we'll
 
04:01:03.550 --> 04:01:03.560 align:start position:0%
stand we'll hang out here because I'm
 
04:01:04.630 --> 04:01:04.640 align:start position:0%
I'm going to look through these bills
 
04:01:05.469 --> 04:01:05.479 align:start position:0%
again see if there's anything else we
 
04:01:06.830 --> 04:01:06.840 align:start position:0%
can discuss but otherwise we don't have
 
04:01:09.030 --> 04:01:09.040 align:start position:0%
another public hearing till 220 so give
 
04:01:11.149 --> 04:01:11.159 align:start position:0%
me one minute to go over the bills in
 
04:01:12.750 --> 04:01:12.760 align:start position:0%
our possession that we've had hearings
 
04:01:12.760 --> 04:01:26.309 align:start position:0%
our possession that we've had hearings
on

04:01:26.309 --> 04:01:26.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:28.870 --> 04:01:28.880 align:start position:0%
okay actually all right thank you so
 
04:01:30.670 --> 04:01:30.680 align:start position:0%
since we do since I did mess up and we
 
04:01:32.670 --> 04:01:32.680 align:start position:0%
do have 20 minutes to kill excuse
 
04:01:35.750 --> 04:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
me canit since we do have 20 minutes
 
04:01:39.670 --> 04:01:39.680 align:start position:0%
let's begin the discussion um on the
 
04:01:42.389 --> 04:01:42.399 align:start position:0%
political advertising bills uh the the
 
04:01:46.710 --> 04:01:46.720 align:start position:0%
sorry the um the ones on public property
 
04:01:49.269 --> 04:01:49.279 align:start position:0%
so I'll open up the P I'll open up the
 
04:01:51.349 --> 04:01:51.359 align:start position:0%
executive session for House
 
04:01:54.870 --> 04:01:54.880 align:start position:0%
Bill let's start with uh House Bill
 
04:01:56.870 --> 04:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
336 relative to the placement of
 
04:01:58.469 --> 04:01:58.479 align:start position:0%
political advertisement on public
 
04:02:00.149 --> 04:02:00.159 align:start position:0%
rideways is anybody everybody have a
 
04:02:05.670 --> 04:02:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:08.349 --> 04:02:08.359 align:start position:0%
bill get it up here on my
 
04:02:14.389 --> 04:02:14.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:18.269 --> 04:02:18.279 align:start position:0%
oh okay so we're on discussion on the
 
04:02:21.550 --> 04:02:21.560 align:start position:0%
bill does anybody have does anybody want
 
04:02:23.149 --> 04:02:23.159 align:start position:0%
to do the opening Salvo on this because
 
04:02:25.229 --> 04:02:25.239 align:start position:0%
I know this one's going to this like
 
04:02:26.349 --> 04:02:26.359 align:start position:0%
this I think this might might one of
 
04:02:27.870 --> 04:02:27.880 align:start position:0%
those weird bills that may not be
 
04:02:29.229 --> 04:02:29.239 align:start position:0%
partisan and may actually divide both
 
04:02:31.149 --> 04:02:31.159 align:start position:0%
caucuses I don't know I could be
 
04:02:33.030 --> 04:02:33.040 align:start position:0%
wrong does anybody have any thoughts
 
04:02:35.950 --> 04:02:35.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:38.870 --> 04:02:38.880 align:start position:0%
with okay representative Mirad thank you
 
04:02:40.990 --> 04:02:41.000 align:start position:0%
for saving me from the awkward
 
04:02:43.070 --> 04:02:43.080 align:start position:0%
silence can you turn on your microphone
 
04:02:43.080 --> 04:02:46.429 align:start position:0%
silence can you turn on your microphone
though

04:02:46.429 --> 04:02:46.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:49.670 --> 04:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
um this is just kind of a grammatical
 
04:02:52.349 --> 04:02:52.359 align:start position:0%
thing um but in the sentences that are
 
04:02:56.149 --> 04:02:56.159 align:start position:0%
being added which are lines 4 through 7
 
04:02:58.309 --> 04:02:58.319 align:start position:0%
you know the first Clause says well
 
04:03:00.750 --> 04:03:00.760 align:start position:0%
unless permission is granted by this or
 
04:03:02.510 --> 04:03:02.520 align:start position:0%
that the political subdivision or the
 
04:03:04.750 --> 04:03:04.760 align:start position:0%
owner and just logically that means that
 
04:03:07.469 --> 04:03:07.479 align:start position:0%
if either one grants permission that's
 
04:03:09.830 --> 04:03:09.840 align:start position:0%
sufficient and then the next sentence
 
04:03:12.469 --> 04:03:12.479 align:start position:0%
says no advertising shall be placed
 
04:03:14.830 --> 04:03:14.840 align:start position:0%
without the owner's consent
 
04:03:16.110 --> 04:03:16.120 align:start position:0%
and and that means that the first
 
04:03:19.590 --> 04:03:19.600 align:start position:0%
sentence should probably say and or or
 
04:03:21.870 --> 04:03:21.880 align:start position:0%
or just be grammatically clarified so
 
04:03:23.950 --> 04:03:23.960 align:start position:0%
that you know first you need the
 
04:03:25.710 --> 04:03:25.720 align:start position:0%
political subdivision approval or maybe
 
04:03:27.510 --> 04:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
you don't need that at all I don't know
 
04:03:29.269 --> 04:03:29.279 align:start position:0%
and then second you need the owner's
 
04:03:32.550 --> 04:03:32.560 align:start position:0%
consent regardless so that or is just a
 
04:03:35.149 --> 04:03:35.159 align:start position:0%
misplaced conjunction I would say I I I
 
04:03:36.750 --> 04:03:36.760 align:start position:0%
would not to be picky no I think it's
 
04:03:39.030 --> 04:03:39.040 align:start position:0%
actually Fair um I think you can strike
 
04:03:40.269 --> 04:03:40.279 align:start position:0%
that granted by the political
 
04:03:42.349 --> 04:03:42.359 align:start position:0%
subdivision because the land is when
 
04:03:44.229 --> 04:03:44.239 align:start position:0%
you're talking about a public right away
 
04:03:46.590 --> 04:03:46.600 align:start position:0%
over private land the land is still
 
04:03:48.630 --> 04:03:48.640 align:start position:0%
owned by the private individual the
 
04:03:52.030 --> 04:03:52.040 align:start position:0%
public just has a right to pass over it
 
04:03:54.229 --> 04:03:54.239 align:start position:0%
um so I don't think you would actually I
 
04:03:55.110 --> 04:03:55.120 align:start position:0%
personally wouldn't believe that you
 
04:03:56.389 --> 04:03:56.399 align:start position:0%
would need the political
 
04:03:57.950 --> 04:03:57.960 align:start position:0%
subdivisions so long as you're not
 
04:04:00.309 --> 04:04:00.319 align:start position:0%
obstructing the right of way right so
 
04:04:02.630 --> 04:04:02.640 align:start position:0%
long as you're not blocking it or
 
04:04:05.149 --> 04:04:05.159 align:start position:0%
blocking a sight line I I don't think
 
04:04:06.910 --> 04:04:06.920 align:start position:0%
you would actually need it nor do I
 
04:04:08.070 --> 04:04:08.080 align:start position:0%
think it would be appropriate and I
 
04:04:10.349 --> 04:04:10.359 align:start position:0%
definitely agree that it's confusing and
 
04:04:11.429 --> 04:04:11.439 align:start position:0%
you definitely shouldn't have the
 
04:04:12.870 --> 04:04:12.880 align:start position:0%
situation where the political
 
04:04:15.429 --> 04:04:15.439 align:start position:0%
subdivision is somehow saying yes you
 
04:04:16.990 --> 04:04:17.000 align:start position:0%
can put signs on this right of way and
 
04:04:18.830 --> 04:04:18.840 align:start position:0%
the property owner is like no you can't
 
04:04:21.269 --> 04:04:21.279 align:start position:0%
it's my land so I I tend to agree I
 
04:04:23.349 --> 04:04:23.359 align:start position:0%
think you could just strike
 
04:04:26.309 --> 04:04:26.319 align:start position:0%
that I I think you can just strike that
 
04:04:28.630 --> 04:04:28.640 align:start position:0%
um by the political subdivision and just
 
04:04:31.189 --> 04:04:31.199 align:start position:0%
kind of as a history of this bill the
 
04:04:33.389 --> 04:04:33.399 align:start position:0%
sponsors did approach me I am a
 
04:04:35.229 --> 04:04:35.239 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor but they they approached me
 
04:04:39.469 --> 04:04:39.479 align:start position:0%
with the concept and I think originally
 
04:04:41.750 --> 04:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
they were trying to do it to where you
 
04:04:43.229 --> 04:04:43.239 align:start position:0%
could place political signs on all
 
04:04:44.830 --> 04:04:44.840 align:start position:0%
public property and I said I'm not into
 
04:04:48.870 --> 04:04:48.880 align:start position:0%
the free-for-all um and I think this is
 
04:04:50.189 --> 04:04:50.199 align:start position:0%
kind of what they came
 
04:04:53.590 --> 04:04:53.600 align:start position:0%
to as an attempt to meet in the middle
 
04:04:55.870 --> 04:04:55.880 align:start position:0%
so for what whatever that's worth but I
 
04:04:57.590 --> 04:04:57.600 align:start position:0%
think that's I I agree with that I
 
04:04:58.990 --> 04:04:59.000 align:start position:0%
definitely don't think that the granted
 
04:05:01.189 --> 04:05:01.199 align:start position:0%
by the pocal subdivision is relevant
 
04:05:03.389 --> 04:05:03.399 align:start position:0%
representative Newsome with that change
 
04:05:05.950 --> 04:05:05.960 align:start position:0%
that you just mentioned isn't that what
 
04:05:09.510 --> 04:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
the status quo Bill existing already is
 
04:05:10.630 --> 04:05:10.640 align:start position:0%
yeah I think and that's where I was
 
04:05:12.510 --> 04:05:12.520 align:start position:0%
headed next with that because they're
 
04:05:15.510 --> 04:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
not that's not what
 
04:05:17.510 --> 04:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
their what they were originally trying
 
04:05:20.309 --> 04:05:20.319 align:start position:0%
to do CU so our laws about putting signs
 
04:05:23.550 --> 04:05:23.560 align:start position:0%
on public property are contradictory um
 
04:05:24.910 --> 04:05:24.920 align:start position:0%
there's one section that says you can't
 
04:05:26.630 --> 04:05:26.640 align:start position:0%
do it and then there's a section about
 
04:05:28.110 --> 04:05:28.120 align:start position:0%
going around and picking up signs set it
 
04:05:29.710 --> 04:05:29.720 align:start position:0%
on public property and who can do it so
 
04:05:31.670 --> 04:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
it's like you have a section that says
 
04:05:32.990 --> 04:05:33.000 align:start position:0%
you can't put the signs up at all and
 
04:05:34.710 --> 04:05:34.720 align:start position:0%
then you have a section that says hey
 
04:05:37.189 --> 04:05:37.199 align:start position:0%
but here's who can pick up the signs um
 
04:05:39.750 --> 04:05:39.760 align:start position:0%
that shouldn't beyond the proper so they
 
04:05:41.030 --> 04:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
that that you you rais that's where I
 
04:05:42.429 --> 04:05:42.439 align:start position:0%
was trying to go with is they were
 
04:05:45.510 --> 04:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
trying to get to the underly question
 
04:05:48.070 --> 04:05:48.080 align:start position:0%
of should you be able to put signs on
 
04:05:49.750 --> 04:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
public property to what extent and how
 
04:05:51.510 --> 04:05:51.520 align:start position:0%
do you regulate it and it kind of got I
 
04:05:54.550 --> 04:05:54.560 align:start position:0%
think muddled in the OS back and forth
 
04:05:55.750 --> 04:05:55.760 align:start position:0%
um and we have two bills about this
 
04:05:56.910 --> 04:05:56.920 align:start position:0%
subject obviously which is why I put
 
04:05:58.710 --> 04:05:58.720 align:start position:0%
them together and why we got 20 minutes
 
04:06:00.149 --> 04:06:00.159 align:start position:0%
we can hash it out now about what we
 
04:06:02.750 --> 04:06:02.760 align:start position:0%
think representative C I was just
 
04:06:04.429 --> 04:06:04.439 align:start position:0%
wondering if it'd be nitpicking to worry
 
04:06:07.710 --> 04:06:07.720 align:start position:0%
about uh whether the town owns the the
 
04:06:09.630 --> 04:06:09.640 align:start position:0%
street or whether it happens to be just
 
04:06:12.110 --> 04:06:12.120 align:start position:0%
a RightWay over private
 
04:06:15.429 --> 04:06:15.439 align:start position:0%
property my my house the town owns the
 
04:06:17.710 --> 04:06:17.720 align:start position:0%
street so I actually have to mow grass
 
04:06:20.269 --> 04:06:20.279 align:start position:0%
on the town's property send that town up
 
04:06:22.830 --> 04:06:22.840 align:start position:0%
there to that um yeah this is not this
 
04:06:24.710 --> 04:06:24.720 align:start position:0%
is one of those things where it's I
 
04:06:26.149 --> 04:06:26.159 align:start position:0%
don't even know how you'd have to like
 
04:06:28.670 --> 04:06:28.680 align:start position:0%
write for every possible scenario
 
04:06:28.680 --> 04:06:29.590 align:start position:0%
write for every possible scenario
represent

04:06:29.590 --> 04:06:29.600 align:start position:0%
represent
 
04:06:33.229 --> 04:06:33.239 align:start position:0%
qua yes thank you Mr chairman I had the
 
04:06:35.590 --> 04:06:35.600 align:start position:0%
same reading of that sentence that
 
04:06:37.910 --> 04:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
representative mad mentioned it does
 
04:06:39.990 --> 04:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
appear to give a political
 
04:06:42.870 --> 04:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
subdivision uh authority to Grant
 
04:06:44.469 --> 04:06:44.479 align:start position:0%
permission to a piece of private
 
04:06:46.349 --> 04:06:46.359 align:start position:0%
property that's under a public right of
 
04:06:49.110 --> 04:06:49.120 align:start position:0%
way and it had the exact same concern I
 
04:06:51.790 --> 04:06:51.800 align:start position:0%
think it could be addressed by removing
 
04:06:54.189 --> 04:06:54.199 align:start position:0%
that first Clause unless permission is
 
04:06:55.910 --> 04:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
granted by the political the sub
 
04:06:58.910 --> 04:06:58.920 align:start position:0%
subdivision or just take strike that out
 
04:07:02.429 --> 04:07:02.439 align:start position:0%
directly in which case it uh no
 
04:07:04.469 --> 04:07:04.479 align:start position:0%
political advertising shall be placed on
 
04:07:07.110 --> 04:07:07.120 align:start position:0%
or a fix to any public
 
04:07:12.030 --> 04:07:12.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:14.269 --> 04:07:14.279 align:start position:0%
see uh I'm trying to see how I'm trying
 
04:07:17.030 --> 04:07:17.040 align:start position:0%
to edit in my head as we're talking but
 
04:07:19.030 --> 04:07:19.040 align:start position:0%
basically what I'm trying to get across
 
04:07:22.269 --> 04:07:22.279 align:start position:0%
is that public property is owned by the
 
04:07:24.670 --> 04:07:24.680 align:start position:0%
political subdivision
 
04:07:24.680 --> 04:07:26.349 align:start position:0%
political subdivision
maybe

04:07:26.349 --> 04:07:26.359 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
04:07:30.990 --> 04:07:31.000 align:start position:0%
right maybe could be State fed can okay
 
04:07:32.790 --> 04:07:32.800 align:start position:0%
no political advertising shall be placed
 
04:07:34.590 --> 04:07:34.600 align:start position:0%
on or a fixed to any public property
 
04:07:36.189 --> 04:07:36.199 align:start position:0%
owned by a political
 
04:07:39.469 --> 04:07:39.479 align:start position:0%
subdivision except uh by permission of
 
04:07:42.429 --> 04:07:42.439 align:start position:0%
the property owner that doesn't address
 
04:07:44.309 --> 04:07:44.319 align:start position:0%
yeah I think it's even more about so the
 
04:07:46.910 --> 04:07:46.920 align:start position:0%
I I I think the question at hand the or
 
04:07:48.870 --> 04:07:48.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't belong there basically oh yeah
 
04:07:51.030 --> 04:07:51.040 align:start position:0%
the language clunky there's no there's
 
04:07:53.309 --> 04:07:53.319 align:start position:0%
no yeah there's no debating that the
 
04:07:55.630 --> 04:07:55.640 align:start position:0%
language is clunky
 
04:07:57.630 --> 04:07:57.640 align:start position:0%
um the question I hand the reason these
 
04:08:00.750 --> 04:08:00.760 align:start position:0%
two bills are put together is I think we
 
04:08:00.760 --> 04:08:01.630 align:start position:0%
two bills are put together is I think we
should

04:08:01.630 --> 04:08:01.640 align:start position:0%
should
 
04:08:04.790 --> 04:08:04.800 align:start position:0%
address the the issue the the underlying
 
04:08:07.189 --> 04:08:07.199 align:start position:0%
issue which is where can candidates put
 
04:08:09.630 --> 04:08:09.640 align:start position:0%
signs on public property I I would
 
04:08:11.070 --> 04:08:11.080 align:start position:0%
venture to say that everyone in this
 
04:08:12.950 --> 04:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
room would agree that you can't put a
 
04:08:15.870 --> 04:08:15.880 align:start position:0%
political sign on someone else's private
 
04:08:17.429 --> 04:08:17.439 align:start position:0%
property without their permission I I
 
04:08:19.189 --> 04:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
would venture to say everybody
 
04:08:21.469 --> 04:08:21.479 align:start position:0%
everybody's on the same page there right
 
04:08:25.269 --> 04:08:25.279 align:start position:0%
so the only so the question is is how do
 
04:08:29.269 --> 04:08:29.279 align:start position:0%
we handle signs on public property and
 
04:08:30.990 --> 04:08:31.000 align:start position:0%
that I do think there would be a
 
04:08:32.790 --> 04:08:32.800 align:start position:0%
differing View and once again I don't
 
04:08:33.910 --> 04:08:33.920 align:start position:0%
think it's partisan I think there' just
 
04:08:35.990 --> 04:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
be differing views in all personally I
 
04:08:37.510 --> 04:08:37.520 align:start position:0%
don't believe signs belong on public
 
04:08:40.429 --> 04:08:40.439 align:start position:0%
property at all um I just I just don't
 
04:08:42.510 --> 04:08:42.520 align:start position:0%
like them I don't I just I don't want to
 
04:08:44.070 --> 04:08:44.080 align:start position:0%
see signs on public property at all I I
 
04:08:45.429 --> 04:08:45.439 align:start position:0%
don't think they belong I think it's
 
04:08:47.349 --> 04:08:47.359 align:start position:0%
lazy campaigning and it quite honestly
 
04:08:48.790 --> 04:08:48.800 align:start position:0%
it just makes the state look trashy in
 
04:08:51.030 --> 04:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
my opinion um if you want to put a
 
04:08:52.269 --> 04:08:52.279 align:start position:0%
public if you want to put a sign up on
 
04:08:53.910 --> 04:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
your own property that is your first
 
04:08:55.510 --> 04:08:55.520 align:start position:0%
amendment right that I will defend to
 
04:08:58.590 --> 04:08:58.600 align:start position:0%
the end um but you know it's where do
 
04:09:00.189 --> 04:09:00.199 align:start position:0%
you draw the line right so if I go put a
 
04:09:01.790 --> 04:09:01.800 align:start position:0%
sign out on the
 
04:09:04.189 --> 04:09:04.199 align:start position:0%
highway right and it's on state ride of
 
04:09:06.269 --> 04:09:06.279 align:start position:0%
way which is what on state proper let's
 
04:09:07.830 --> 04:09:07.840 align:start position:0%
say the state owns the highway it's on
 
04:09:12.710 --> 04:09:12.720 align:start position:0%
the state highway land and you know if
 
04:09:14.109 --> 04:09:14.119 align:start position:0%
if if I could do that no one's going to
 
04:09:17.630 --> 04:09:17.640 align:start position:0%
lose their mind if I go and I litter the
 
04:09:20.630 --> 04:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
the front lawn of town hall with Barry
 
04:09:23.269 --> 04:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
and the chicken sign um people are going
 
04:09:25.910 --> 04:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
to be mad you know either way there's a
 
04:09:28.149 --> 04:09:28.159 align:start position:0%
sign on public property right and I
 
04:09:29.950 --> 04:09:29.960 align:start position:0%
guess my contention is is how do you how
 
04:09:32.910 --> 04:09:32.920 align:start position:0%
do you adjudicate in
 
04:09:35.349 --> 04:09:35.359 align:start position:0%
policy when one is okay and when one is
 
04:09:37.109 --> 04:09:37.119 align:start position:0%
not okay so I kind of want to hear what
 
04:09:38.750 --> 04:09:38.760 align:start position:0%
people's thoughts are like when is it
 
04:09:40.309 --> 04:09:40.319 align:start position:0%
okay to do this I've already taken a
 
04:09:42.070 --> 04:09:42.080 align:start position:0%
position of I don't I I'd rather just
 
04:09:44.910 --> 04:09:44.920 align:start position:0%
not but when is it okay to do it in what
 
04:09:46.550 --> 04:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
situation isn't okay and then the next
 
04:09:48.149 --> 04:09:48.159 align:start position:0%
bill following up to this is what are
 
04:09:51.429 --> 04:09:51.439 align:start position:0%
the abutter rights to that um you know
 
04:09:54.309 --> 04:09:54.319 align:start position:0%
you could you can raise issue with
 
04:09:56.630 --> 04:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
representative wier's Bill about the the
 
04:09:59.070 --> 04:09:59.080 align:start position:0%
mechanics of it the underlying point is
 
04:10:02.469 --> 04:10:02.479 align:start position:0%
is if you're in a butter and it's
 
04:10:04.830 --> 04:10:04.840 align:start position:0%
technically state right away or land or
 
04:10:06.229 --> 04:10:06.239 align:start position:0%
whatever you want to call it and
 
04:10:08.149 --> 04:10:08.159 align:start position:0%
somebody puts a sign up there and it's
 
04:10:09.630 --> 04:10:09.640 align:start position:0%
legal illegal whatever you want to call
 
04:10:11.349 --> 04:10:11.359 align:start position:0%
it but it looks like it Shores like I
 
04:10:12.590 --> 04:10:12.600 align:start position:0%
think there's a legitimate there's a
 
04:10:15.349 --> 04:10:15.359 align:start position:0%
legitimate concern in there um but once
 
04:10:17.710 --> 04:10:17.720 align:start position:0%
again you there's a there's a gray area
 
04:10:19.429 --> 04:10:19.439 align:start position:0%
right if it's in the middle like he's
 
04:10:20.550 --> 04:10:20.560 align:start position:0%
talking about if it's in the middle of
 
04:10:22.550 --> 04:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
the triangle in the middle of the road
 
04:10:24.149 --> 04:10:24.159 align:start position:0%
nobody cares if it's on your if it's
 
04:10:25.349 --> 04:10:25.359 align:start position:0%
next to your land and implies that
 
04:10:26.670 --> 04:10:26.680 align:start position:0%
you're doing it I can see why you'd be
 
04:10:28.389 --> 04:10:28.399 align:start position:0%
upset so what are other people's
 
04:10:29.950 --> 04:10:29.960 align:start position:0%
thoughts about the placement of these
 
04:10:31.590 --> 04:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
political signs on public property
 
04:10:32.670 --> 04:10:32.680 align:start position:0%
that's where I need to get to like where
 
04:10:34.710 --> 04:10:34.720 align:start position:0%
are we at on that representative
 
04:10:37.830 --> 04:10:37.840 align:start position:0%
toner I me my ultimate opinion would be
 
04:10:39.950 --> 04:10:39.960 align:start position:0%
basically like the parallels with you
 
04:10:42.790 --> 04:10:42.800 align:start position:0%
that um I don't want to see like if
 
04:10:44.750 --> 04:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
there's like public common or Park I
 
04:10:46.910 --> 04:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
don't want to see it littered with
 
04:10:50.149 --> 04:10:50.159 align:start position:0%
political signs at any time um so I I
 
04:10:52.870 --> 04:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
par the only question I would have is
 
04:10:54.630 --> 04:10:54.640 align:start position:0%
that like the day of the elections like
 
04:10:56.429 --> 04:10:56.439 align:start position:0%
in our town they have a designated area
 
04:10:58.710 --> 04:10:58.720 align:start position:0%
at the high school where which is
 
04:11:01.590 --> 04:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
technically public land that we could
 
04:11:04.149 --> 04:11:04.159 align:start position:0%
place signs for that
 
04:11:06.750 --> 04:11:06.760 align:start position:0%
day and I don't know how that would play
 
04:11:09.790 --> 04:11:09.800 align:start position:0%
into this so there was conversation when
 
04:11:11.830 --> 04:11:11.840 align:start position:0%
I was discussing this bill with the
 
04:11:14.109 --> 04:11:14.119 align:start position:0%
sponsors I told I didn't have an
 
04:11:17.550 --> 04:11:17.560 align:start position:0%
objection if a town passed an ordinance
 
04:11:20.990 --> 04:11:21.000 align:start position:0%
saying you could put signs here or here
 
04:11:23.309 --> 04:11:23.319 align:start position:0%
right um there were people that wanted
 
04:11:25.070 --> 04:11:25.080 align:start position:0%
the default to be you can put signs
 
04:11:26.870 --> 04:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
wherever you want in the town and the
 
04:11:28.229 --> 04:11:28.239 align:start position:0%
town can ban where you can't put it and
 
04:11:29.750 --> 04:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
I said no no no that's that's
 
04:11:31.950 --> 04:11:31.960 align:start position:0%
free-for-all but I I I'd be okay with
 
04:11:33.550 --> 04:11:33.560 align:start position:0%
that if the town passes dordan and says
 
04:11:35.550 --> 04:11:35.560 align:start position:0%
you can put signs here during election
 
04:11:36.750 --> 04:11:36.760 align:start position:0%
you know this is the election heing zone
 
04:11:38.510 --> 04:11:38.520 align:start position:0%
for signs you can put it here during
 
04:11:39.870 --> 04:11:39.880 align:start position:0%
this time like I'm totally cool with
 
04:11:41.950 --> 04:11:41.960 align:start position:0%
that if there's a vote by a public body
 
04:11:43.510 --> 04:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
and they can resend it I'm toally fine
 
04:11:44.590 --> 04:11:44.600 align:start position:0%
but I don't want the I personally don't
 
04:11:46.510 --> 04:11:46.520 align:start position:0%
want the default to be yes I think the
 
04:11:48.030 --> 04:11:48.040 align:start position:0%
default should be no unless the town
 
04:11:50.109 --> 04:11:50.119 align:start position:0%
says yes that's my personal opinion
 
04:11:50.119 --> 04:11:52.109 align:start position:0%
says yes that's my personal opinion
representative

04:11:52.109 --> 04:11:52.119 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:11:54.670 --> 04:11:54.680 align:start position:0%
Grill yeah I think I'm I'm on the same
 
04:11:56.070 --> 04:11:56.080 align:start position:0%
page maybe we could include language
 
04:11:58.510 --> 04:11:58.520 align:start position:0%
that specifies the towns could vote for
 
04:12:00.750 --> 04:12:00.760 align:start position:0%
special election earing sections of town
 
04:12:03.149 --> 04:12:03.159 align:start position:0%
or whatever uh but I think this does a
 
04:12:05.389 --> 04:12:05.399 align:start position:0%
good job addressing the gray area
 
04:12:08.189 --> 04:12:08.199 align:start position:0%
between you know parts of town that
 
04:12:09.670 --> 04:12:09.680 align:start position:0%
might look like public property might be
 
04:12:11.510 --> 04:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
adjacent to a highway or a major road
 
04:12:15.590 --> 04:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
and um I think i' also agree that we
 
04:12:17.469 --> 04:12:17.479 align:start position:0%
should defer to the owner of the land
 
04:12:19.710 --> 04:12:19.720 align:start position:0%
and I'd be I'd be fine with striking the
 
04:12:21.510 --> 04:12:21.520 align:start position:0%
political subdivision part of that as
 
04:12:26.429 --> 04:12:26.439 align:start position:0%
well um because I think that um makes it
 
04:12:28.630 --> 04:12:28.640 align:start position:0%
again more deferential to the property
 
04:12:31.149 --> 04:12:31.159 align:start position:0%
owner who has to look at the signs on
 
04:12:32.910 --> 04:12:32.920 align:start position:0%
their property or near their property
 
04:12:34.710 --> 04:12:34.720 align:start position:0%
every day and also prevents it from
 
04:12:36.349 --> 04:12:36.359 align:start position:0%
being a free-for-all and everyone just
 
04:12:39.309 --> 04:12:39.319 align:start position:0%
putting their signs up 93 North and um
 
04:12:41.870 --> 04:12:41.880 align:start position:0%
mucking that up so I'm I think that
 
04:12:43.750 --> 04:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
would be good and we could include the
 
04:12:46.469 --> 04:12:46.479 align:start position:0%
um the language on Town specific
 
04:12:49.510 --> 04:12:49.520 align:start position:0%
ordinances as well repres B I think I
 
04:12:50.510 --> 04:12:50.520 align:start position:0%
saw your
 
04:12:53.630 --> 04:12:53.640 align:start position:0%
hand thank you Mr chairman uh I'm going
 
04:12:56.590 --> 04:12:56.600 align:start position:0%
to mark this on my calendar because I
 
04:13:01.149 --> 04:13:01.159 align:start position:0%
totally totally agree with you on uh no
 
04:13:03.750 --> 04:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
signs on public properties I just want
 
04:13:07.389 --> 04:13:07.399 align:start position:0%
to mention that representative wood I
 
04:13:09.550 --> 04:13:09.560 align:start position:0%
won't I won't be as
 
04:13:11.990 --> 04:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
nice I I think this is way too
 
04:13:14.189 --> 04:13:14.199 align:start position:0%
complicated I love the the signs I love
 
04:13:16.950 --> 04:13:16.960 align:start position:0%
the fight it is the be one of the best
 
04:13:19.469 --> 04:13:19.479 align:start position:0%
parts of running we have signs of public
 
04:13:22.670 --> 04:13:22.680 align:start position:0%
property we have signs taking off public
 
04:13:25.870 --> 04:13:25.880 align:start position:0%
property go to the town they made a they
 
04:13:28.030 --> 04:13:28.040 align:start position:0%
passed they said could put them here we
 
04:13:30.469 --> 04:13:30.479 align:start position:0%
could put them there all the towns are
 
04:13:32.630 --> 04:13:32.640 align:start position:0%
so different there are areas I mean
 
04:13:34.070 --> 04:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
people want to run they want to know
 
04:13:36.030 --> 04:13:36.040 align:start position:0%
what they are there's there's a
 
04:13:37.469 --> 04:13:37.479 align:start position:0%
contradiction I de what people all the
 
04:13:39.630 --> 04:13:39.640 align:start position:0%
time not another sign everybody
 
04:13:41.630 --> 04:13:41.640 align:start position:0%
recognizes our sign throughout the state
 
04:13:43.990 --> 04:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
not another sign I said well want you
 
04:13:45.950 --> 04:13:45.960 align:start position:0%
don't want to know who's running so it's
 
04:13:47.590 --> 04:13:47.600 align:start position:0%
a contradiction here but it's a fun
 
04:13:48.870 --> 04:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
contradiction to play with when you're
 
04:13:51.149 --> 04:13:51.159 align:start position:0%
running you you're getting people upset
 
04:13:52.670 --> 04:13:52.680 align:start position:0%
you're getting some people to like you
 
04:13:54.149 --> 04:13:54.159 align:start position:0%
it's just part of the game we're going
 
04:13:56.910 --> 04:13:56.920 align:start position:0%
to go over there now every public place
 
04:13:59.510 --> 04:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
in my town I can't put a sign that's
 
04:14:01.510 --> 04:14:01.520 align:start position:0%
ridiculous there's a lot of public
 
04:14:03.870 --> 04:14:03.880 align:start position:0%
places that really don't even belong to
 
04:14:06.469 --> 04:14:06.479 align:start position:0%
the town who the heck knows how it owns
 
04:14:09.030 --> 04:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
you know we find when people upset we
 
04:14:11.030 --> 04:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
move them it's that easy and some people
 
04:14:13.710 --> 04:14:13.720 align:start position:0%
move them for us you know
 
04:14:15.269 --> 04:14:15.279 align:start position:0%
that's I believe that's a
 
04:14:18.149 --> 04:14:18.159 align:start position:0%
crime I believe that is a crime you can
 
04:14:20.189 --> 04:14:20.199 align:start position:0%
doce jail time for that anyways rson har
 
04:14:23.630 --> 04:14:23.640 align:start position:0%
bullia thank you very much real quick um
 
04:14:26.429 --> 04:14:26.439 align:start position:0%
yeah I have to agree with uh The Chair
 
04:14:29.630 --> 04:14:29.640 align:start position:0%
by and large I'm sorry but um when it
 
04:14:31.630 --> 04:14:31.640 align:start position:0%
comes to primaries where you have about
 
04:14:35.109 --> 04:14:35.119 align:start position:0%
15 candidates at the top of the ticket
 
04:14:37.349 --> 04:14:37.359 align:start position:0%
guess who gets to remove all those signs
 
04:14:40.550 --> 04:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
that that are left behind because it's
 
04:14:42.309 --> 04:14:42.319 align:start position:0%
not usually the candidates that come by
 
04:14:44.269 --> 04:14:44.279 align:start position:0%
and pick them up it's it's the people in
 
04:14:47.109 --> 04:14:47.119 align:start position:0%
the town of that party have to go and do
 
04:14:49.590 --> 04:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
all the clean up so yeah it's a big
 
04:14:52.030 --> 04:14:52.040 align:start position:0%
trashy problem I I agree I'm I'm fine
 
04:14:54.590 --> 04:14:54.600 align:start position:0%
with buttoning it up and I don't und
 
04:14:56.229 --> 04:14:56.239 align:start position:0%
really understand I'll have to look up
 
04:14:58.510 --> 04:14:58.520 align:start position:0%
but if you re if you somebody puts a
 
04:15:01.389 --> 04:15:01.399 align:start position:0%
sign on your property that's not a crime
 
04:15:03.870 --> 04:15:03.880 align:start position:0%
to remove it right no it's not if it's
 
04:15:06.229 --> 04:15:06.239 align:start position:0%
on your property no it's not explicitly
 
04:15:08.149 --> 04:15:08.159 align:start position:0%
allow it's explicitly allowed yeah um
 
04:15:09.269 --> 04:15:09.279 align:start position:0%
other people I told you you guys this
 
04:15:10.590 --> 04:15:10.600 align:start position:0%
wasn't going to be partisan I told you
 
04:15:12.269 --> 04:15:12.279 align:start position:0%
this is this is one of those weird ones
 
04:15:14.590 --> 04:15:14.600 align:start position:0%
that'll cut that'll cut different ways
 
04:15:17.269 --> 04:15:17.279 align:start position:0%
um any other comments any yes Ron
 
04:15:18.630 --> 04:15:18.640 align:start position:0%
Wilhelm I'm excited how how does the
 
04:15:21.070 --> 04:15:21.080 align:start position:0%
North End of Manchester feel about uh SS
 
04:15:22.229 --> 04:15:22.239 align:start position:0%
on public property well it's a great
 
04:15:23.389 --> 04:15:23.399 align:start position:0%
question I appreciate you asking
 
04:15:26.510 --> 04:15:26.520 align:start position:0%
chairman I think uh I'm I have not yet
 
04:15:28.670 --> 04:15:28.680 align:start position:0%
pulled my constituents specifically on
 
04:15:32.070 --> 04:15:32.080 align:start position:0%
this uh however listening to you talk
 
04:15:36.429 --> 04:15:36.439 align:start position:0%
about that the solution of saying hey
 
04:15:39.910 --> 04:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
let's let's defer to the municipalities
 
04:15:44.070 --> 04:15:44.080 align:start position:0%
let's say if you pass in public session
 
04:15:46.910 --> 04:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
uh you know some sort of a uh during
 
04:15:48.910 --> 04:15:48.920 align:start position:0%
this time period or this particular
 
04:15:51.990 --> 04:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
space signs can go up but otherwise
 
04:15:53.750 --> 04:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
across the board they should be banned I
 
04:15:57.109 --> 04:15:57.119 align:start position:0%
think that makes a ton of sense um and
 
04:15:58.710 --> 04:15:58.720 align:start position:0%
would love to work with you on Crafting
 
04:16:01.149 --> 04:16:01.159 align:start position:0%
and amendment I would love to do that a
 
04:16:03.269 --> 04:16:03.279 align:start position:0%
a Barry Wilhelm election law Amendment
 
04:16:06.670 --> 04:16:06.680 align:start position:0%
would blow a lot of Mines um I'll ask
 
04:16:08.870 --> 04:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
follow up to that one if I if I may what
 
04:16:14.070 --> 04:16:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:15.750 --> 04:16:15.760 align:start position:0%
I think representative Mirad has some
 
04:16:18.269 --> 04:16:18.279 align:start position:0%
ideas I hate the following words I I I
 
04:16:20.710 --> 04:16:20.720 align:start position:0%
swore would never pass my lips this
 
04:16:22.710 --> 04:16:22.720 align:start position:0%
session but I'm going to let them
 
04:16:22.720 --> 04:16:23.830 align:start position:0%
session but I'm going to let them
interim

04:16:23.830 --> 04:16:23.840 align:start position:0%
interim
 
04:16:28.149 --> 04:16:28.159 align:start position:0%
study oh God no no I I refuse I refuse I
 
04:16:30.590 --> 04:16:30.600 align:start position:0%
refuse I refuse to look no one here no
 
04:16:32.309 --> 04:16:32.319 align:start position:0%
one here wants to do
 
04:16:35.469 --> 04:16:35.479 align:start position:0%
that um I think that's the next like
 
04:16:38.109 --> 04:16:38.119 align:start position:0%
because there's it's right it's it's
 
04:16:40.349 --> 04:16:40.359 align:start position:0%
complicated right because you have you
 
04:16:40.359 --> 04:16:41.070 align:start position:0%
complicated right because you have you
have

04:16:41.070 --> 04:16:41.080 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:16:43.790 --> 04:16:43.800 align:start position:0%
Municipal you have
 
04:16:45.550 --> 04:16:45.560 align:start position:0%
County people forget County I represent
 
04:16:47.550 --> 04:16:47.560 align:start position:0%
golf town I've got County property
 
04:16:50.910 --> 04:16:50.920 align:start position:0%
County State and then feds which I I I I
 
04:16:52.229 --> 04:16:52.239 align:start position:0%
think the I think it's banned on the
 
04:16:54.469 --> 04:16:54.479 align:start position:0%
federal property but representative
 
04:16:57.710 --> 04:16:57.720 align:start position:0%
toner thank you I just wanted to add
 
04:16:59.550 --> 04:16:59.560 align:start position:0%
like because it was thrown around like
 
04:17:01.109 --> 04:17:01.119 align:start position:0%
putting signs on like the interstate and
 
04:17:03.630 --> 04:17:03.640 align:start position:0%
stuff like that that's it's
 
04:17:07.349 --> 04:17:07.359 align:start position:0%
illegal um two uh
 
04:17:11.070 --> 04:17:11.080 align:start position:0%
23673 236 that's an election law statue
 
04:17:13.670 --> 04:17:13.680 align:start position:0%
yeah it's it's in cuz I worked in the do
 
04:17:14.750 --> 04:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
yeah it's
 
04:17:17.469 --> 04:17:17.479 align:start position:0%
Transportation um on federal highways
 
04:17:19.870 --> 04:17:19.880 align:start position:0%
and federal like and that's federal land
 
04:17:22.109 --> 04:17:22.119 align:start position:0%
and the turnpikes it's illegal to put
 
04:17:24.469 --> 04:17:24.479 align:start position:0%
signs in any of the medians any of the
 
04:17:27.830 --> 04:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
exit ramps going up um basically there's
 
04:17:31.469 --> 04:17:31.479 align:start position:0%
fences a very large right of way in the
 
04:17:34.030 --> 04:17:34.040 align:start position:0%
interstates systems and it's illegal to
 
04:17:35.790 --> 04:17:35.800 align:start position:0%
do it so I'm gonna I'm going to blow
 
04:17:37.950 --> 04:17:37.960 align:start position:0%
your mind here you ready uh political
 
04:17:40.109 --> 04:17:40.119 align:start position:0%
advertising may be placed on state owns
 
04:17:41.229 --> 04:17:41.239 align:start position:0%
rights of way as long as the
 
04:17:42.590 --> 04:17:42.600 align:start position:0%
advertisement does not obstruct the safe
 
04:17:45.870 --> 04:17:45.880 align:start position:0%
flow of traffic um and the advertising
 
04:17:47.309 --> 04:17:47.319 align:start position:0%
is placed the consent of the Landor the
 
04:17:48.990 --> 04:17:49.000 align:start position:0%
right of way so that's when they're
 
04:17:51.229 --> 04:17:51.239 align:start position:0%
talking about I think highways they're
 
04:17:53.309 --> 04:17:53.319 align:start position:0%
talking about you can do it it's it's
 
04:17:55.229 --> 04:17:55.239 align:start position:0%
it's definitely conflict it conflicts I
 
04:17:58.109 --> 04:17:58.119 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm with you like that's part of the
 
04:17:59.870 --> 04:17:59.880 align:start position:0%
problem with this subject is it
 
04:18:02.269 --> 04:18:02.279 align:start position:0%
literally conflicts with itself like the
 
04:18:03.870 --> 04:18:03.880 align:start position:0%
election law conflicts with itself much
 
04:18:05.469 --> 04:18:05.479 align:start position:0%
less with the transportation statute you
 
04:18:07.590 --> 04:18:07.600 align:start position:0%
decided like it it
 
04:18:09.990 --> 04:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
definitely it it's like our campaign
 
04:18:11.910 --> 04:18:11.920 align:start position:0%
Finance laws which are say one thing and
 
04:18:13.269 --> 04:18:13.279 align:start position:0%
we have a bill where it's like like one
 
04:18:16.830 --> 04:18:16.840 align:start position:0%
one and immediately the other so um but
 
04:18:19.070 --> 04:18:19.080 align:start position:0%
yes we'll have to that's you know once
 
04:18:21.590 --> 04:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
again like what do it's not just state
 
04:18:23.070 --> 04:18:23.080 align:start position:0%
right away on highways like that it's
 
04:18:25.189 --> 04:18:25.199 align:start position:0%
state property in general like I'm
 
04:18:27.109 --> 04:18:27.119 align:start position:0%
asking the question of what about state
 
04:18:28.910 --> 04:18:28.920 align:start position:0%
property in general because the
 
04:18:31.229 --> 04:18:31.239 align:start position:0%
municipalities right now don't have the
 
04:18:32.990 --> 04:18:33.000 align:start position:0%
authority to control the state property
 
04:18:37.070 --> 04:18:37.080 align:start position:0%
at all in any way right um so we have we
 
04:18:38.469 --> 04:18:38.479 align:start position:0%
that's why I asked that question is is
 
04:18:40.990 --> 04:18:41.000 align:start position:0%
you know state parks right state parks
 
04:18:44.109 --> 04:18:44.119 align:start position:0%
represent qu
 
04:18:46.710 --> 04:18:46.720 align:start position:0%
maybe modify that sentence uh no
 
04:18:48.630 --> 04:18:48.640 align:start position:0%
political advertising shall be placed on
 
04:18:50.149 --> 04:18:50.159 align:start position:0%
or a fix to any public property
 
04:18:52.950 --> 04:18:52.960 align:start position:0%
including Highway rights of way unless
 
04:18:55.309 --> 04:18:55.319 align:start position:0%
permission is granted by the owner of
 
04:18:58.349 --> 04:18:58.359 align:start position:0%
that property
 
04:19:00.910 --> 04:19:00.920 align:start position:0%
period because every piece of property
 
04:19:03.469 --> 04:19:03.479 align:start position:0%
in our system has an owner whether it's
 
04:19:06.510 --> 04:19:06.520 align:start position:0%
an individual or a governmental
 
04:19:08.269 --> 04:19:08.279 align:start position:0%
organization or some other kind of
 
04:19:10.910 --> 04:19:10.920 align:start position:0%
organization yeah so that I think would
 
04:19:13.070 --> 04:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
clear up the confusion at least yeah
 
04:19:13.950 --> 04:19:13.960 align:start position:0%
that would probably clear for the
 
04:19:15.070 --> 04:19:15.080 align:start position:0%
confusion but it doesn't answer the
 
04:19:18.109 --> 04:19:18.119 align:start position:0%
underlying problem of what should be
 
04:19:20.469 --> 04:19:20.479 align:start position:0%
allowed well that would be in this case
 
04:19:22.429 --> 04:19:22.439 align:start position:0%
that would be up to the owner of the
 
04:19:24.670 --> 04:19:24.680 align:start position:0%
property whether it's the state or the
 
04:19:26.910 --> 04:19:26.920 align:start position:0%
political subdivision as far as your
 
04:19:28.389 --> 04:19:28.399 align:start position:0%
point about objecting to signs
 
04:19:30.309 --> 04:19:30.319 align:start position:0%
personally I'm I'm with representative
 
04:19:31.870 --> 04:19:31.880 align:start position:0%
wood I don't I don't object to the
 
04:19:34.710 --> 04:19:34.720 align:start position:0%
display of colorful political colorful
 
04:19:37.950 --> 04:19:37.960 align:start position:0%
display of political fervor but uh I
 
04:19:39.790 --> 04:19:39.800 align:start position:0%
think that would make it clear and
 
04:19:41.910 --> 04:19:41.920 align:start position:0%
unambiguous if we made a change as I
 
04:19:44.309 --> 04:19:44.319 align:start position:0%
just suggested representative Mirad I
 
04:19:46.990 --> 04:19:47.000 align:start position:0%
mean if chairman Barry's photo were on
 
04:19:48.550 --> 04:19:48.560 align:start position:0%
the sign would you object to that
 
04:19:50.389 --> 04:19:50.399 align:start position:0%
representative that's an entirely
 
04:19:52.670 --> 04:19:52.680 align:start position:0%
separate issue I put a uh I put a
 
04:19:56.469 --> 04:19:56.479 align:start position:0%
literal Chicken on my sign so as a part
 
04:19:58.070 --> 04:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
of that by the way was to send the
 
04:19:59.189 --> 04:19:59.199 align:start position:0%
message of what I thought about
 
04:20:01.710 --> 04:20:01.720 align:start position:0%
political science that that presumes is
 
04:20:04.229 --> 04:20:04.239 align:start position:0%
a machine robust enough to actually take
 
04:20:05.910 --> 04:20:05.920 align:start position:0%
a picture of him it would break the
 
04:20:05.920 --> 04:20:07.910 align:start position:0%
a picture of him it would break the
camera

04:20:07.910 --> 04:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
camera
 
04:20:11.149 --> 04:20:11.159 align:start position:0%
immediately um other questions comments
 
04:20:13.670 --> 04:20:13.680 align:start position:0%
other kind of thoughts about
 
04:20:15.550 --> 04:20:15.560 align:start position:0%
signs and property
 
04:20:18.070 --> 04:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
and you can't well that's the problem is
 
04:20:19.189 --> 04:20:19.199 align:start position:0%
it's we're going to keep dealing with
 
04:20:21.510 --> 04:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
this issue you got turn your microphone
 
04:20:24.630 --> 04:20:24.640 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm sorry make it simple just up to
 
04:20:26.189 --> 04:20:26.199 align:start position:0%
the people that own the property and let
 
04:20:28.750 --> 04:20:28.760 align:start position:0%
us duke it out I mean come on we can do
 
04:20:31.550 --> 04:20:31.560 align:start position:0%
this representative PR O'Brien thank you
 
04:20:33.389 --> 04:20:33.399 align:start position:0%
uh I don't know this isn't really a
 
04:20:35.189 --> 04:20:35.199 align:start position:0%
question it's a comment but as we're
 
04:20:36.550 --> 04:20:36.560 align:start position:0%
we're we're in comment we're in EXA
 
04:20:38.990 --> 04:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
session so you can comment as
 
04:20:43.429 --> 04:20:43.439 align:start position:0%
um wer was representative w
 
04:20:43.439 --> 04:20:44.469 align:start position:0%
um wer was representative w
wheer

04:20:44.469 --> 04:20:44.479 align:start position:0%
wheer
 
04:20:47.229 --> 04:20:47.239 align:start position:0%
werer was speaking I was thinking about
 
04:20:50.149 --> 04:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
how I observe signs throughout the
 
04:20:51.670 --> 04:20:51.680 align:start position:0%
community as I'm driving around you know
 
04:20:53.189 --> 04:20:53.199 align:start position:0%
during election
 
04:20:55.510 --> 04:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
time it makes a difference if it's on
 
04:20:57.309 --> 04:20:57.319 align:start position:0%
public property or private property and
 
04:20:59.229 --> 04:20:59.239 align:start position:0%
I can kind of tell I can tell the
 
04:21:02.510 --> 04:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
difference but maybe I'm looking at it
 
04:21:06.229 --> 04:21:06.239 align:start position:0%
you know from too too close maybe I'm
 
04:21:08.030 --> 04:21:08.040 align:start position:0%
too close to the issue because I see it
 
04:21:10.389 --> 04:21:10.399 align:start position:0%
and I say oh those are signs that are on
 
04:21:11.670 --> 04:21:11.680 align:start position:0%
public property oh those are signs that
 
04:21:14.469 --> 04:21:14.479 align:start position:0%
are in someone's actual yard and it
 
04:21:15.950 --> 04:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
feels like that it's much more of an
 
04:21:17.590 --> 04:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
investment that an individual is making
 
04:21:18.990 --> 04:21:19.000 align:start position:0%
when they put it in their own yard it
 
04:21:22.510 --> 04:21:22.520 align:start position:0%
means more to me um the other stuff just
 
04:21:24.469 --> 04:21:24.479 align:start position:0%
looks like campaign staff putting signs
 
04:21:27.189 --> 04:21:27.199 align:start position:0%
out this summer I saw one on Route 89
 
04:21:29.429 --> 04:21:29.439 align:start position:0%
right on one of the exits and that was
 
04:21:31.710 --> 04:21:31.720 align:start position:0%
just some campaign staffer who didn't
 
04:21:34.349 --> 04:21:34.359 align:start position:0%
know yet that that was not not okay it
 
04:21:37.990 --> 04:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
was gone soon after that but I felt like
 
04:21:39.389 --> 04:21:39.399 align:start position:0%
I was a little too close to the issue to
 
04:21:41.750 --> 04:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
really um understand it the way maybe
 
04:21:44.790 --> 04:21:44.800 align:start position:0%
the General Public does and I if I was
 
04:21:46.269 --> 04:21:46.279 align:start position:0%
like if I was wier's neighbor I don't
 
04:21:48.870 --> 04:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
think I would assume that wer suddenly
 
04:21:52.269 --> 04:21:52.279 align:start position:0%
started um endorsing someone that he
 
04:21:54.269 --> 04:21:54.279 align:start position:0%
otherwise never would have I wouldn't
 
04:21:55.910 --> 04:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
take that as an endorsement I would
 
04:21:57.229 --> 04:21:57.239 align:start position:0%
understand that what what I was looking
 
04:21:59.950 --> 04:21:59.960 align:start position:0%
at was on public property all right uh
 
04:22:01.910 --> 04:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
we're at 220 so we're going to drop out
 
04:22:03.030 --> 04:22:03.040 align:start position:0%
of executive session I'm going to leave
 
04:22:04.830 --> 04:22:04.840 align:start position:0%
you with this um whenever I have a
 
04:22:06.550 --> 04:22:06.560 align:start position:0%
question about how the general public
 
04:22:08.109 --> 04:22:08.119 align:start position:0%
feels about political stuff I always ask
 
04:22:10.030 --> 04:22:10.040 align:start position:0%
my wife um and the reason being is my
 
04:22:12.149 --> 04:22:12.159 align:start position:0%
wife is very non-political um and the
 
04:22:14.070 --> 04:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
only she she gets politics through
 
04:22:16.429 --> 04:22:16.439 align:start position:0%
osmosis through me being on the phone
 
04:22:18.189 --> 04:22:18.199 align:start position:0%
and and it being an important part of my
 
04:22:21.429 --> 04:22:21.439 align:start position:0%
life um but I I I kind of use her as my
 
04:22:23.030 --> 04:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
Lim test so there's this corner in go
 
04:22:25.550 --> 04:22:25.560 align:start position:0%
town um coming out of Bedford uh 14
 
04:22:28.990 --> 04:22:29.000 align:start position:0%
where 114 turns and every candidate just
 
04:22:31.189 --> 04:22:31.199 align:start position:0%
throws signs in there and it looks like
 
04:22:33.790 --> 04:22:33.800 align:start position:0%
confetti and she knows the names right
 
04:22:35.349 --> 04:22:35.359 align:start position:0%
she knows because she's hearing me she
 
04:22:36.630 --> 04:22:36.640 align:start position:0%
hears me says things about the
 
04:22:39.670 --> 04:22:39.680 align:start position:0%
candidates um so she knows the names and
 
04:22:42.870 --> 04:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
we were driving by um in September drove
 
04:22:44.910 --> 04:22:44.920 align:start position:0%
through there and I I turn said hey we
 
04:22:46.550 --> 04:22:46.560 align:start position:0%
we drove through that we were stopped at
 
04:22:48.030 --> 04:22:48.040 align:start position:0%
the stoplight so we looked at the
 
04:22:49.710 --> 04:22:49.720 align:start position:0%
confetti signs we stopped there we were
 
04:22:51.469 --> 04:22:51.479 align:start position:0%
there for like a minute like 90 seconds
 
04:22:54.030 --> 04:22:54.040 align:start position:0%
before we turned and we turned off and I
 
04:22:55.910 --> 04:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
I drove forward and I said hey babe can
 
04:22:57.910 --> 04:22:57.920 align:start position:0%
you tell me any name you just saw in any
 
04:22:59.830 --> 04:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
of those signs she said other than the
 
04:23:02.710 --> 04:23:02.720 align:start position:0%
Trump one no so that's you know that's
 
04:23:04.229 --> 04:23:04.239 align:start position:0%
kind of how it it gets it gets to be
 
04:23:05.670 --> 04:23:05.680 align:start position:0%
noise at a certain point is my point
 
04:23:07.590 --> 04:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
anyways all right we're at 2:20 so we're
 
04:23:09.309 --> 04:23:09.319 align:start position:0%
going to in the executive session uh if
 
04:23:10.309 --> 04:23:10.319 align:start position:0%
we have time we'll come back to that
 
04:23:12.750 --> 04:23:12.760 align:start position:0%
vigorating debate I did enjoy that um um
 
04:23:14.750 --> 04:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to open up the uh public
 
04:23:18.389 --> 04:23:18.399 align:start position:0%
hearing on cacr 3 relative to recall
 
04:23:19.670 --> 04:23:19.680 align:start position:0%
elections providing that the general
 
04:23:22.109 --> 04:23:22.119 align:start position:0%
court May authorize recall elections
 
04:23:23.429 --> 04:23:23.439 align:start position:0%
representative Moffett do you have
 
04:23:25.349 --> 04:23:25.359 align:start position:0%
written testimony is that what that
 
04:23:27.990 --> 04:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
is yes all right can can you give that

introduction thank you Mr chair I notice
 
04:23:43.790 --> 04:23:43.800 align:start position:0%
your oper ation is very smooth and ahead
 
04:23:46.910 --> 04:23:46.920 align:start position:0%
of schedule um I would point out that in
 
04:23:48.950 --> 04:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
another committee room we also have two
 
04:23:51.269 --> 04:23:51.279 align:start position:0%
clocks one is on the slow side one is on
 
04:23:53.309 --> 04:23:53.319 align:start position:0%
the fast side which gives the chair some
 
04:23:56.950 --> 04:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
discretion with time anyway um for the
 
04:23:59.109 --> 04:23:59.119 align:start position:0%
record uh my name is representative Mike
 
04:24:03.469 --> 04:24:03.479 align:start position:0%
Moffett uh representing marac District 4
 
04:24:05.550 --> 04:24:05.560 align:start position:0%
beautiful towns of Lowden and
 
04:24:08.550 --> 04:24:08.560 align:start position:0%
Canterbury so some students from my
 
04:24:11.590 --> 04:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
original hometown of gron uh recently
 
04:24:13.670 --> 04:24:13.680 align:start position:0%
did a state house visit just just last
 
04:24:16.830 --> 04:24:16.840 align:start position:0%
week and I followed him around for a bit
 
04:24:19.469 --> 04:24:19.479 align:start position:0%
and uh even when they visited the
 
04:24:23.070 --> 04:24:23.080 align:start position:0%
legislative chamber adjacent to rep's
 
04:24:26.070 --> 04:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
Hall uh and the district one senator
 
04:24:27.990 --> 04:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
from Littleton gave a wonderful Civics
 
04:24:30.269 --> 04:24:30.279 align:start position:0%
presentation to the youngsters from
 
04:24:32.469 --> 04:24:32.479 align:start position:0%
gron and uh then he said are there any
 
04:24:34.149 --> 04:24:34.159 align:start position:0%
questions and a young girl raised her
 
04:24:36.750 --> 04:24:36.760 align:start position:0%
hand and asked if we don't like what
 
04:24:39.750 --> 04:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
you're doing how do we fire you so the
 
04:24:41.590 --> 04:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
senator was a bit taken aback by the
 
04:24:43.109 --> 04:24:43.119 align:start position:0%
little girl's question and he explained
 
04:24:45.309 --> 04:24:45.319 align:start position:0%
that when the next schedule election
 
04:24:47.590 --> 04:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
comes up that the voters could make a
 
04:24:49.670 --> 04:24:49.680 align:start position:0%
change if they wanted which brings us to
 
04:24:52.950 --> 04:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
cacr three uh this is a measure we've
 
04:24:54.910 --> 04:24:54.920 align:start position:0%
brought forth before that did not move
 
04:24:56.469 --> 04:24:56.479 align:start position:0%
forward for whatever
 
04:24:58.870 --> 04:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
reason uh but sometimes it takes us two
 
04:25:01.510 --> 04:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
or even three tries to get something
 
04:25:03.630 --> 04:25:03.640 align:start position:0%
moved forward that should move forward
 
04:25:08.189 --> 04:25:08.199 align:start position:0%
like like this so please note line 12 uh
 
04:25:12.070 --> 04:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
we're only talking about adding 22 words
 
04:25:16.149 --> 04:25:16.159 align:start position:0%
to to our Constitution's Article Five
 
04:25:18.910 --> 04:25:18.920 align:start position:0%
the general court article the
 
04:25:22.910 --> 04:25:22.920 align:start position:0%
legislation legislator article quote and
 
04:25:26.070 --> 04:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
to provide a recall procedure to permit
 
04:25:28.630 --> 04:25:28.640 align:start position:0%
citizens to remove an elected official
 
04:25:31.149 --> 04:25:31.159 align:start position:0%
before the end of a term of office
 
04:25:34.590 --> 04:25:34.600 align:start position:0%
unquote that's all 22 words and it's
 
04:25:36.990 --> 04:25:37.000 align:start position:0%
kind of enabling legislation if you will
 
04:25:41.229 --> 04:25:41.239 align:start position:0%
it would empower the legislature to take
 
04:25:43.670 --> 04:25:43.680 align:start position:0%
action in this area that that
 
04:25:47.070 --> 04:25:47.080 align:start position:0%
constitutionally really can't do now so
 
04:25:49.309 --> 04:25:49.319 align:start position:0%
this we don't have a prescriptive plan
 
04:25:51.030 --> 04:25:51.040 align:start position:0%
here that would be down the road if this
 
04:25:53.510 --> 04:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
ever passes and if the legislature and
 
04:25:55.790 --> 04:25:55.800 align:start position:0%
its wisdom thinks that it should look at
 
04:25:59.670 --> 04:25:59.680 align:start position:0%
a a a uh recall
 
04:26:01.910 --> 04:26:01.920 align:start position:0%
procedure so when I brought this forward
 
04:26:04.189 --> 04:26:04.199 align:start position:0%
the last time a rep State Rep approached
 
04:26:07.229 --> 04:26:07.239 align:start position:0%
me in the lobby and said to me you know
 
04:26:10.910 --> 04:26:10.920 align:start position:0%
we have two-year terms here I said oh
 
04:26:13.870 --> 04:26:13.880 align:start position:0%
thank you and another rep approached
 
04:26:16.830 --> 04:26:16.840 align:start position:0%
me another rep approached me and said
 
04:26:18.910 --> 04:26:18.920 align:start position:0%
you know all elected officials in New
 
04:26:22.070 --> 04:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire serve two-year terms to which
 
04:26:24.309 --> 04:26:24.319 align:start position:0%
I responded something to to the effect
 
04:26:27.790 --> 04:26:27.800 align:start position:0%
well I'll be down uh I know I know that
 
04:26:30.990 --> 04:26:31.000 align:start position:0%
I'm the guy who puts a lot of civics
 
04:26:34.109 --> 04:26:34.119 align:start position:0%
measures in into play and into law so I
 
04:26:35.910 --> 04:26:35.920 align:start position:0%
should probably point out which I just
 
04:26:39.830 --> 04:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
did that uh Civics is something that I
 
04:26:41.830 --> 04:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
taught take seriously and I'm very proud
 
04:26:43.469 --> 04:26:43.479 align:start position:0%
of the stuff that I've gotten through
 
04:26:45.469 --> 04:26:45.479 align:start position:0%
and I'm still trying to get
 
04:26:48.910 --> 04:26:48.920 align:start position:0%
through uh so I get it our we have
 
04:26:51.990 --> 04:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
two-year terms um but this really isn't
 
04:26:52.000 --> 04:26:53.229 align:start position:0%
two-year terms um but this really isn't
about

04:26:53.229 --> 04:26:53.239 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:26:56.910 --> 04:26:56.920 align:start position:0%
us it's really about Municipal and
 
04:26:56.920 --> 04:26:57.990 align:start position:0%
us it's really about Municipal and
County

04:26:57.990 --> 04:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
County
 
04:27:01.750 --> 04:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
officials uh back back momentarily to
 
04:27:04.149 --> 04:27:04.159 align:start position:0%
legislators uh who as you probably have
 
04:27:06.710 --> 04:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
heard serve twoyear terms um I'll point
 
04:27:08.550 --> 04:27:08.560 align:start position:0%
out that a State Rep from our Gateway
 
04:27:11.109 --> 04:27:11.119 align:start position:0%
city was elected last term despite some
 
04:27:13.349 --> 04:27:13.359 align:start position:0%
serious legal problems some of you will
 
04:27:15.710 --> 04:27:15.720 align:start position:0%
recall uh in fact when it came time for
 
04:27:19.189 --> 04:27:19.199 align:start position:0%
our organization day um this rep was was
 
04:27:20.830 --> 04:27:20.840 align:start position:0%
incarcerated at the
 
04:27:24.030 --> 04:27:24.040 align:start position:0%
time uh the person was in the big house
 
04:27:27.429 --> 04:27:27.439 align:start position:0%
not the state house and with our house
 
04:27:30.389 --> 04:27:30.399 align:start position:0%
party breakdown something like 199 to
 
04:27:32.790 --> 04:27:32.800 align:start position:0%
199 something like that there was acute
 
04:27:35.189 --> 04:27:35.199 align:start position:0%
interest in in h the status of this rep
 
04:27:36.550 --> 04:27:36.560 align:start position:0%
who was
 
04:27:39.189 --> 04:27:39.199 align:start position:0%
incarcerated so that the point I'm
 
04:27:40.950 --> 04:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
making is that even though this really
 
04:27:42.710 --> 04:27:42.720 align:start position:0%
isn't particularly about two-year
 
04:27:46.790 --> 04:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
positions it could be U it could be and
 
04:27:50.510 --> 04:27:50.520 align:start position:0%
so if my if my representative was
 
04:27:53.710 --> 04:27:53.720 align:start position:0%
incarcerated and it happens countless
 
04:27:55.349 --> 04:27:55.359 align:start position:0%
examples all over the country not so
 
04:27:57.630 --> 04:27:57.640 align:start position:0%
much in New Hampshire but I might be
 
04:27:59.750 --> 04:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
like the little girl from gron and say
 
04:28:04.349 --> 04:28:04.359 align:start position:0%
what do we do with my my rep in jail but
 
04:28:05.429 --> 04:28:05.439 align:start position:0%
again this is mostly about three and
 
04:28:08.030 --> 04:28:08.040 align:start position:0%
four year term so many elected Municipal
 
04:28:10.750 --> 04:28:10.760 align:start position:0%
board members serve three-year terms as
 
04:28:13.030 --> 04:28:13.040 align:start position:0%
you know select boards school boards on
 
04:28:15.950 --> 04:28:15.960 align:start position:0%
and on three-year terms you you all are
 
04:28:19.550 --> 04:28:19.560 align:start position:0%
the experts on that so uh we even have
 
04:28:21.229 --> 04:28:21.239 align:start position:0%
some County positions now that are
 
04:28:23.990 --> 04:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
four-year terms and so that's the nub of
 
04:28:27.590 --> 04:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
this thing what this is to empower the
 
04:28:31.550 --> 04:28:31.560 align:start position:0%
people what if a municipality a county a
 
04:28:36.269 --> 04:28:36.279 align:start position:0%
town a city whatever uh has some Bad
 
04:28:38.149 --> 04:28:38.159 align:start position:0%
actors what what if they get a skunk as
 
04:28:40.189 --> 04:28:40.199 align:start position:0%
a school board member or or a select
 
04:28:42.309 --> 04:28:42.319 align:start position:0%
board member or a county official
 
04:28:44.429 --> 04:28:44.439 align:start position:0%
someone who lied like crazy to get
 
04:28:47.790 --> 04:28:47.800 align:start position:0%
elected we've seen it we've all seen it
 
04:28:49.790 --> 04:28:49.800 align:start position:0%
and then they do a 180 once they get
 
04:28:51.830 --> 04:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
elected and they they go against what
 
04:28:54.030 --> 04:28:54.040 align:start position:0%
they said they do or promised they do or
 
04:28:56.109 --> 04:28:56.119 align:start position:0%
who they were and then the voters the
 
04:28:58.630 --> 04:28:58.640 align:start position:0%
citizens are stuck with this person for
 
04:29:01.950 --> 04:29:01.960 align:start position:0%
years two years three years even four
 
04:29:04.389 --> 04:29:04.399 align:start position:0%
years uh so what what can we do what can
 
04:29:07.349 --> 04:29:07.359 align:start position:0%
we do with these people well can you say
 
04:29:11.149 --> 04:29:11.159 align:start position:0%
paid administrative leave that's happens
 
04:29:13.590 --> 04:29:13.600 align:start position:0%
all too often so this is really about
 
04:29:15.269 --> 04:29:15.279 align:start position:0%
empowering citizens and giving them a
 
04:29:18.590 --> 04:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
away to fire if you will someone who
 
04:29:18.600 --> 04:29:19.950 align:start position:0%
away to fire if you will someone who
needs

04:29:19.950 --> 04:29:19.960 align:start position:0%
needs
 
04:29:22.550 --> 04:29:22.560 align:start position:0%
firing someone who saw I submitted the
 
04:29:25.469 --> 04:29:25.479 align:start position:0%
cacr said to me uh you know good luck
 
04:29:27.590 --> 04:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
with that you think politicians will
 
04:29:31.070 --> 04:29:31.080 align:start position:0%
ever give people the means to fire them
 
04:29:33.070 --> 04:29:33.080 align:start position:0%
and I hate being called a politician I
 
04:29:35.269 --> 04:29:35.279 align:start position:0%
don't think I'm a politician politician
 
04:29:38.910 --> 04:29:38.920 align:start position:0%
some big money dude uh I I correct them
 
04:29:41.109 --> 04:29:41.119 align:start position:0%
I say we're citizen legislate
 
04:29:43.349 --> 04:29:43.359 align:start position:0%
legislators I'm I'm not a politician I'm
 
04:29:44.469 --> 04:29:44.479 align:start position:0%
a citizen
 
04:29:46.870 --> 04:29:46.880 align:start position:0%
legislator and I want to think that all
 
04:29:49.590 --> 04:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
of all the legislatures in America the
 
04:29:52.030 --> 04:29:52.040 align:start position:0%
truly the world famous 424 member New
 
04:29:54.950 --> 04:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire General Court where we earn
 
04:29:57.189 --> 04:29:57.199 align:start position:0%
100 bucks a year is the the noblest
 
04:30:00.030 --> 04:30:00.040 align:start position:0%
least corrupt body in America I believe
 
04:30:03.469 --> 04:30:03.479 align:start position:0%
that so I'm not sure why these 22 words
 
04:30:05.030 --> 04:30:05.040 align:start position:0%
haven't been added yet to our
 
04:30:07.070 --> 04:30:07.080 align:start position:0%
constitution maybe this time
 
04:30:09.990 --> 04:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
around so when the gron kids are walking
 
04:30:13.590 --> 04:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
out of the legis relative chamber
 
04:30:16.790 --> 04:30:16.800 align:start position:0%
adjacent to rep's Hall okay it's the
 
04:30:18.070 --> 04:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
senate for you watching at home I'm
 
04:30:20.429 --> 04:30:20.439 align:start position:0%
talking about the Senate um you can't
 
04:30:23.830 --> 04:30:23.840 align:start position:0%
use profanity in here I'm sorry sir okay
 
04:30:26.429 --> 04:30:26.439 align:start position:0%
uh I I hear Mr
 
04:30:29.870 --> 04:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
chair um so I saw the little girl as
 
04:30:31.710 --> 04:30:31.720 align:start position:0%
they left that other chamber and I went
 
04:30:34.630 --> 04:30:34.640 align:start position:0%
up to her and I said uh to the little
 
04:30:36.750 --> 04:30:36.760 align:start position:0%
girl I said uh that was a great question
 
04:30:38.469 --> 04:30:38.479 align:start position:0%
I'm glad you asked it I'm not sure if
 
04:30:40.469 --> 04:30:40.479 align:start position:0%
the senator liked the question but I did
 
04:30:42.030 --> 04:30:42.040 align:start position:0%
and I just want you to know that we
 
04:30:43.389 --> 04:30:43.399 align:start position:0%
working on
 
04:30:48.910 --> 04:30:48.920 align:start position:0%
it um so a cacr is a heavy LIF it has to
 
04:30:52.670 --> 04:30:52.680 align:start position:0%
get through this uh esteemed committee
 
04:30:55.030 --> 04:30:55.040 align:start position:0%
then then the full house if it gets
 
04:30:56.790 --> 04:30:56.800 align:start position:0%
it'll go to the house anyway it has to
 
04:31:00.070 --> 04:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
be voted on it's the cacr it needs 60%
 
04:31:01.510 --> 04:31:01.520 align:start position:0%
and then it needs
 
04:31:05.309 --> 04:31:05.319 align:start position:0%
67% approval in a Statewide ballot is is
 
04:31:07.429 --> 04:31:07.439 align:start position:0%
as you know this committee knows that
 
04:31:09.750 --> 04:31:09.760 align:start position:0%
better than anybody we just had a cacr
 
04:31:12.309 --> 04:31:12.319 align:start position:0%
in the ballot November it got 66 six
 
04:31:15.750 --> 04:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
plus perc it came just short of the 67%
 
04:31:19.149 --> 04:31:19.159 align:start position:0%
that was on the judicial retirement age
 
04:31:21.550 --> 04:31:21.560 align:start position:0%
but you know what uh I believe if our
 
04:31:23.510 --> 04:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
fellow Granite Staters get a chance to
 
04:31:24.790 --> 04:31:24.800 align:start position:0%
vote on this
 
04:31:28.070 --> 04:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
cacr I think it would pass easily and
 
04:31:30.830 --> 04:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
that's saying quite a lot 67% is a high
 
04:31:33.750 --> 04:31:33.760 align:start position:0%
bar I truly believe if the voters if the
 
04:31:36.950 --> 04:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
people had a chance to win and and uh
 
04:31:39.710 --> 04:31:39.720 align:start position:0%
improve the constitution in this manner
 
04:31:43.149 --> 04:31:43.159 align:start position:0%
uh 70 80% I believe that I think the
 
04:31:45.389 --> 04:31:45.399 align:start position:0%
people want this our people our the
 
04:31:47.550 --> 04:31:47.560 align:start position:0%
people we represent so I hope this
 
04:31:49.429 --> 04:31:49.439 align:start position:0%
committee and its Collective bipartisan
 
04:31:51.510 --> 04:31:51.520 align:start position:0%
wisdom this by by the way is a bipart is
 
04:31:53.189 --> 04:31:53.199 align:start position:0%
said bipartisan support it's not a
 
04:31:56.790 --> 04:31:56.800 align:start position:0%
partisan Bill uh I hope you'll give CAC
 
04:31:59.910 --> 04:31:59.920 align:start position:0%
cacr 3 a chance and uh and eventually
 
04:32:02.550 --> 04:32:02.560 align:start position:0%
give the people a chance and I'm happy
 
04:32:04.189 --> 04:32:04.199 align:start position:0%
to try to answer any questions if there
 
04:32:05.630 --> 04:32:05.640 align:start position:0%
are any questions from the committee
 
04:32:08.109 --> 04:32:08.119 align:start position:0%
representative wood thank you Mr
 
04:32:10.429 --> 04:32:10.439 align:start position:0%
chairman are you aware there's a way
 
04:32:12.950 --> 04:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
there is a way now to remove an elected
 
04:32:15.349 --> 04:32:15.359 align:start position:0%
official am I aware that there is a way
 
04:32:17.990 --> 04:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
now to remove an elected official I know
 
04:32:20.149 --> 04:32:20.159 align:start position:0%
there are some processes in place in
 
04:32:23.030 --> 04:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
certain uh uh you're talking about on
 
04:32:25.550 --> 04:32:25.560 align:start position:0%
the municipal level correct correct
 
04:32:27.870 --> 04:32:27.880 align:start position:0%
anybody elected right I believe it's
 
04:32:30.109 --> 04:32:30.119 align:start position:0%
anybody that's elected there are actions
 
04:32:33.349 --> 04:32:33.359 align:start position:0%
that can be taken um so why would we
 
04:32:34.990 --> 04:32:35.000 align:start position:0%
need another
 
04:32:38.030 --> 04:32:38.040 align:start position:0%
action well uh represent you you go
 
04:32:40.030 --> 04:32:40.040 align:start position:0%
ahead and describe the action now if
 
04:32:42.710 --> 04:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
somebody in Pittsfield was a s or let's
 
04:32:44.910 --> 04:32:44.920 align:start position:0%
say any Town someone from any town was a
 
04:32:48.630 --> 04:32:48.640 align:start position:0%
uh a corrupt uh board member who uh
 
04:32:51.630 --> 04:32:51.640 align:start position:0%
needed to be removed uh tell us that
 
04:32:55.149 --> 04:32:55.159 align:start position:0%
process if you he can't he can't he
 
04:32:57.349 --> 04:32:57.359 align:start position:0%
can't do that he can't it's a it's a
 
04:33:01.070 --> 04:33:01.080 align:start position:0%
one-way Street okay yeah uh to answer
 
04:33:03.429 --> 04:33:03.439 align:start position:0%
your question yes there are ways to do
 
04:33:05.230 --> 04:33:05.240 align:start position:0%
that now I think they're cumbersome I
 
04:33:06.830 --> 04:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
think that they're not easy I think this
 
04:33:08.949 --> 04:33:08.959 align:start position:0%
would this would enable the legislature
 
04:33:11.750 --> 04:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
to put the imprimer of the general court
 
04:33:14.470 --> 04:33:14.480 align:start position:0%
on a process yet to be determined that
 
04:33:17.910 --> 04:33:17.920 align:start position:0%
would apply not only to uh Municipal
 
04:33:20.070 --> 04:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
officials but also County and state
 
04:33:23.189 --> 04:33:23.199 align:start position:0%
officials does that help a little bit
 
04:33:25.629 --> 04:33:25.639 align:start position:0%
thank you yes repres thank you for your
 
04:33:27.910 --> 04:33:27.920 align:start position:0%
question uh thank you Mr chairman thank
 
04:33:29.349 --> 04:33:29.359 align:start position:0%
you representative for taking my
 
04:33:32.830 --> 04:33:32.840 align:start position:0%
question uh what about appointed
 
04:33:36.349 --> 04:33:36.359 align:start position:0%
officials such as on local level uh my
 
04:33:38.510 --> 04:33:38.520 align:start position:0%
town clerk happens to be appointed or
 
04:33:41.310 --> 04:33:41.320 align:start position:0%
the deputy clerk not the in the the
 
04:33:45.070 --> 04:33:45.080 align:start position:0%
actual town clerk is is elected but also
 
04:33:47.189 --> 04:33:47.199 align:start position:0%
like on the state level the various
 
04:33:51.109 --> 04:33:51.119 align:start position:0%
appointed uh department heads of all the
 
04:33:52.990 --> 04:33:53.000 align:start position:0%
uh various State
 
04:33:55.869 --> 04:33:55.879 align:start position:0%
departments that is a great question and
 
04:33:57.590 --> 04:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
you all heard the question what about
 
04:33:59.590 --> 04:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
appointed officials so that's the beauty
 
04:34:02.150 --> 04:34:02.160 align:start position:0%
of this proposal uh representative is
 
04:34:04.709 --> 04:34:04.719 align:start position:0%
that if this enabling language get into
 
04:34:08.390 --> 04:34:08.400 align:start position:0%
the Constitution then uh the legislature
 
04:34:11.189 --> 04:34:11.199 align:start position:0%
then uh folks uh reps or people in this
 
04:34:13.590 --> 04:34:13.600 align:start position:0%
committee could come up with some sort
 
04:34:17.670 --> 04:34:17.680 align:start position:0%
of language to uh uh enable uh
 
04:34:21.629 --> 04:34:21.639 align:start position:0%
municipalities to do something about a
 
04:34:24.551 --> 04:34:24.561 align:start position:0%
appointed official uh that may or may
 
04:34:26.269 --> 04:34:26.279 align:start position:0%
not be
 
04:34:28.869 --> 04:34:28.879 align:start position:0%
uh uh that we may or may not be able to
 
04:34:30.990 --> 04:34:31.000 align:start position:0%
do anything about now so uh great
 
04:34:32.670 --> 04:34:32.680 align:start position:0%
question and that's another reason I
 
04:34:33.789 --> 04:34:33.799 align:start position:0%
think why this should be good to move
 
04:34:37.189 --> 04:34:37.199 align:start position:0%
forward so that uh such actions could be
 
04:34:39.429 --> 04:34:39.439 align:start position:0%
uh put into law to address
 
04:34:41.269 --> 04:34:41.279 align:start position:0%
that further questions from the
 
04:34:41.279 --> 04:34:42.750 align:start position:0%
that further questions from the
committee

04:34:42.750 --> 04:34:42.760 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:34:45.629 --> 04:34:45.639 align:start position:0%
um y represent your head thank you thank
 
04:34:48.390 --> 04:34:48.400 align:start position:0%
you represent would you if this were put
 
04:34:50.029 --> 04:34:50.039 align:start position:0%
into operation would you have any
 
04:34:52.390 --> 04:34:52.400 align:start position:0%
concern about extremist groups extremist
 
04:34:54.470 --> 04:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
groups on the left and the right very
 
04:34:57.510 --> 04:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
well-funded extremist groups um mounting
 
04:35:00.869 --> 04:35:00.879 align:start position:0%
recall campaigns every time someone was
 
04:35:03.429 --> 04:35:03.439 align:start position:0%
elected um where they disagreed with the
 
04:35:05.269 --> 04:35:05.279 align:start position:0%
outcome of the election so that
 
04:35:07.029 --> 04:35:07.039 align:start position:0%
Governors for instance would just
 
04:35:09.510 --> 04:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
constantly and routinely face recall
 
04:35:11.070 --> 04:35:11.080 align:start position:0%
campaigns in their first months in
 
04:35:11.080 --> 04:35:12.470 align:start position:0%
campaigns in their first months in
office

04:35:12.470 --> 04:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
office
 
04:35:13.189 --> 04:35:13.199 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:35:14.830 --> 04:35:14.840 align:start position:0%
representative that's a a great question
 
04:35:18.150 --> 04:35:18.160 align:start position:0%
honestly and my answer to that is uh not
 
04:35:19.789 --> 04:35:19.799 align:start position:0%
that you're trying to scare anybody with
 
04:35:21.750 --> 04:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
that but I I think that notion is the
 
04:35:24.029 --> 04:35:24.039 align:start position:0%
type of notion that would spook people
 
04:35:26.189 --> 04:35:26.199 align:start position:0%
and say well you know extremists could
 
04:35:29.670 --> 04:35:29.680 align:start position:0%
come in and and and so we to avoid that
 
04:35:33.189 --> 04:35:33.199 align:start position:0%
scenario we should uh not do this um I
 
04:35:35.269 --> 04:35:35.279 align:start position:0%
will say that in our federal system it's
 
04:35:36.830 --> 04:35:36.840 align:start position:0%
always useful to see what other states
 
04:35:38.910 --> 04:35:38.920 align:start position:0%
are doing in many other states H you
 
04:35:40.429 --> 04:35:40.439 align:start position:0%
know has this been a problem in other
 
04:35:42.230 --> 04:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
states um
 
04:35:44.910 --> 04:35:44.920 align:start position:0%
California uh not that I'm saying they
 
04:35:46.629 --> 04:35:46.639 align:start position:0%
should be a model but California has a
 
04:35:49.070 --> 04:35:49.080 align:start position:0%
recall provision uh they recently just
 
04:35:51.230 --> 04:35:51.240 align:start position:0%
two years ago recall their governor how
 
04:35:53.150 --> 04:35:53.160 align:start position:0%
did that happen they had uh tens or
 
04:35:54.910 --> 04:35:54.920 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousands of people sign on
 
04:35:56.349 --> 04:35:56.359 align:start position:0%
to do that I don't think they were
 
04:35:59.390 --> 04:35:59.400 align:start position:0%
extremist uh in fact in
 
04:36:02.670 --> 04:36:02.680 align:start position:0%
2003 uh California uh did recall
 
04:36:06.230 --> 04:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
Governor Gray Davis um because he lied
 
04:36:08.269 --> 04:36:08.279 align:start position:0%
and he uh did this and did that and he
 
04:36:10.230 --> 04:36:10.240 align:start position:0%
was not who he promised he'd be they had
 
04:36:11.629 --> 04:36:11.639 align:start position:0%
a recall election and arold
 
04:36:13.590 --> 04:36:13.600 align:start position:0%
Schwarzenegger or whatever his name was
 
04:36:16.590 --> 04:36:16.600 align:start position:0%
became Governor so my my answer is that
 
04:36:18.990 --> 04:36:19.000 align:start position:0%
uh is a good question and I trust the
 
04:36:21.590 --> 04:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
American people in our processes and if
 
04:36:24.551 --> 04:36:24.561 align:start position:0%
some you know small minority of
 
04:36:27.230 --> 04:36:27.240 align:start position:0%
extremists wanted to uh do what you
 
04:36:29.150 --> 04:36:29.160 align:start position:0%
describe I think the uh the better
 
04:36:31.189 --> 04:36:31.199 align:start position:0%
angels that I think populate all of our
 
04:36:32.670 --> 04:36:32.680 align:start position:0%
communities would
 
04:36:34.910 --> 04:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
Prevail hopefully that answers your
 
04:36:34.920 --> 04:36:36.750 align:start position:0%
Prevail hopefully that answers your
question

04:36:36.750 --> 04:36:36.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:36:36.760 --> 04:36:38.310 align:start position:0%
question
somewhat

04:36:38.310 --> 04:36:38.320 align:start position:0%
somewhat
 
04:36:41.590 --> 04:36:41.600 align:start position:0%
representative gusovsky
 
04:36:43.390 --> 04:36:43.400 align:start position:0%
do we have that big of a problem in the
 
04:36:47.349 --> 04:36:47.359 align:start position:0%
state where we need this change to the
 
04:36:50.349 --> 04:36:50.359 align:start position:0%
Constitution um you know just a little
 
04:36:53.109 --> 04:36:53.119 align:start position:0%
antidote in Northwood we have removed
 
04:36:56.429 --> 04:36:56.439 align:start position:0%
one person from the school board and a
 
04:36:59.029 --> 04:36:59.039 align:start position:0%
planning board member the town wanted to
 
04:37:02.070 --> 04:37:02.080 align:start position:0%
remove that person we had a town meeting
 
04:37:04.670 --> 04:37:04.680 align:start position:0%
and as a Selectmen I'm on the board we
 
04:37:07.310 --> 04:37:07.320 align:start position:0%
chose not to remove that person so there
 
04:37:10.349 --> 04:37:10.359 align:start position:0%
are processes in place and I'm just
 
04:37:14.910 --> 04:37:14.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:17.310 --> 04:37:17.320 align:start position:0%
amendment just for the sake of making it
 
04:37:19.709 --> 04:37:19.719 align:start position:0%
do we actually have a problem that you
 
04:37:22.269 --> 04:37:22.279 align:start position:0%
feel we need this amendment now thank
 
04:37:23.670 --> 04:37:23.680 align:start position:0%
you for the question representative and
 
04:37:25.310 --> 04:37:25.320 align:start position:0%
the the representative from Pittsfield
 
04:37:26.830 --> 04:37:26.840 align:start position:0%
uh already made the great point that
 
04:37:28.551 --> 04:37:28.561 align:start position:0%
there are processes in place as you
 
04:37:30.990 --> 04:37:31.000 align:start position:0%
described in in Northwood to do this and
 
04:37:33.551 --> 04:37:33.561 align:start position:0%
as I said earlier uh I really see a need
 
04:37:38.789 --> 04:37:38.799 align:start position:0%
to uh empower the legislature to broaden
 
04:37:41.510 --> 04:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
the the power of the people to take to
 
04:37:44.830 --> 04:37:44.840 align:start position:0%
do more than uh take on what what
 
04:37:48.670 --> 04:37:48.680 align:start position:0%
malfant they may see locally uh is
 
04:37:51.349 --> 04:37:51.359 align:start position:0%
another example there may be some
 
04:37:54.310 --> 04:37:54.320 align:start position:0%
localities where there's a whole cabal
 
04:37:57.029 --> 04:37:57.039 align:start position:0%
of of of people who are not doing the
 
04:37:59.789 --> 04:37:59.799 align:start position:0%
right thing so if this legislature
 
04:38:03.869 --> 04:38:03.879 align:start position:0%
someday uh puts something into law that
 
04:38:08.029 --> 04:38:08.039 align:start position:0%
would enable people locally to petition
 
04:38:11.830 --> 04:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
or or have other means of redress to
 
04:38:14.189 --> 04:38:14.199 align:start position:0%
address Mal fence when it occurs and it
 
04:38:16.670 --> 04:38:16.680 align:start position:0%
does occur we can all think of examples
 
04:38:19.230 --> 04:38:19.240 align:start position:0%
so yes I I I hear you you make a great
 
04:38:20.949 --> 04:38:20.959 align:start position:0%
Point as the representative from
 
04:38:23.269 --> 04:38:23.279 align:start position:0%
Pittsfield did but I think our existing
 
04:38:25.470 --> 04:38:25.480 align:start position:0%
processes could be better and broadened
 
04:38:28.910 --> 04:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
to include uh the the rare occasions
 
04:38:30.869 --> 04:38:30.879 align:start position:0%
where there might be some County or
 
04:38:34.789 --> 04:38:34.799 align:start position:0%
state officials um I I don't see this as
 
04:38:37.310 --> 04:38:37.320 align:start position:0%
a threat to most two-year terms as I've
 
04:38:40.949 --> 04:38:40.959 align:start position:0%
already mentioned but that can happen uh
 
04:38:44.230 --> 04:38:44.240 align:start position:0%
I gave an example already of of one uh
 
04:38:47.189 --> 04:38:47.199 align:start position:0%
State Rep who had they not resigned uh I
 
04:38:49.150 --> 04:38:49.160 align:start position:0%
think the people would have wanted to
 
04:38:52.510 --> 04:38:52.520 align:start position:0%
have the CH the chance to uh replace
 
04:38:56.230 --> 04:38:56.240 align:start position:0%
that person and uh without um enabling
 
04:38:59.310 --> 04:38:59.320 align:start position:0%
legislation that would enable you all to
 
04:39:02.789 --> 04:39:02.799 align:start position:0%
come up with some ideas um then uh that
 
04:39:05.029 --> 04:39:05.039 align:start position:0%
will still be out there and some if if
 
04:39:06.990 --> 04:39:07.000 align:start position:0%
we don't do it now someday
 
04:39:09.189 --> 04:39:09.199 align:start position:0%
somehow I believe that
 
04:39:13.830 --> 04:39:13.840 align:start position:0%
we'll broaden our recall
 
04:39:15.789 --> 04:39:15.799 align:start position:0%

04:39:54.670 --> 04:39:54.680 align:start position:0%

my name is Jordan oler Hillsboro 13
 
04:42:27.470 --> 04:42:27.480 align:start position:0%
that's the town of Hudson uh in reading
 
04:42:29.910 --> 04:42:29.920 align:start position:0%
the uh New Hampshire Constitution you
 
04:42:34.430 --> 04:42:34.440 align:start position:0%
notice that any um inhabitant of a
 
04:42:38.510 --> 04:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
community is entitled to vote just an
 
04:42:41.708 --> 04:42:41.718 align:start position:0%
inhabitant doesn't have to live here
 
04:42:44.628 --> 04:42:44.638 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to reside here just has to
 
04:42:49.230 --> 04:42:49.240 align:start position:0%
declare a community in the town as his
 
04:42:52.550 --> 04:42:52.560 align:start position:0%
inhabitants and he can vote we've run
 
04:42:55.670 --> 04:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
into several issues of this today or
 
04:42:58.230 --> 04:42:58.240 align:start position:0%
yesterday actually you look listen to
 
04:42:59.830 --> 04:42:59.840 align:start position:0%
the news there were a couple of people
 
04:43:02.230 --> 04:43:02.240 align:start position:0%
from uh
 
04:43:04.350 --> 04:43:04.360 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts who were charged with the
 
04:43:08.830 --> 04:43:08.840 align:start position:0%
crime of voting in Ashland repeatedly in
 
04:43:12.030 --> 04:43:12.040 align:start position:0%
town elections and in state elections
 
04:43:14.708 --> 04:43:14.718 align:start position:0%
and in federal elections now they may
 
04:43:16.948 --> 04:43:16.958 align:start position:0%
have violated federal
 
04:43:20.670 --> 04:43:20.680 align:start position:0%
law they may not have violated state law
 
04:43:22.430 --> 04:43:22.440 align:start position:0%
because the Constitution says you only
 
04:43:24.990 --> 04:43:25.000 align:start position:0%
have to be an inhabitant and they were
 
04:43:25.000 --> 04:43:26.150 align:start position:0%
have to be an inhabitant and they were
declaring

04:43:26.150 --> 04:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
declaring
 
04:43:29.310 --> 04:43:29.320 align:start position:0%
inhabitants in one town where they
 
04:43:31.788 --> 04:43:31.798 align:start position:0%
actually spent Mo the majority of their
 
04:43:34.750 --> 04:43:34.760 align:start position:0%
time someplace else we have a lot of
 
04:43:37.030 --> 04:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
people who are as you know snowbirds
 
04:43:38.470 --> 04:43:38.480 align:start position:0%
good time of year for
 
04:43:40.708 --> 04:43:40.718 align:start position:0%
snowbirds uh except there's more snow in
 
04:43:43.310 --> 04:43:43.320 align:start position:0%
Florida than there is in Southern New
 
04:43:44.510 --> 04:43:44.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire right
 
04:43:49.670 --> 04:43:49.680 align:start position:0%
now but the idea is to codify our
 
04:43:52.190 --> 04:43:52.200 align:start position:0%
constitution to say exactly what it
 
04:43:54.830 --> 04:43:54.840 align:start position:0%
meant when it was first put into
 
04:43:56.830 --> 04:43:56.840 align:start position:0%
existence that is that if you're going
 
04:43:59.510 --> 04:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
to be a resident you need to be a legal
 
04:44:02.550 --> 04:44:02.560 align:start position:0%
resident you need to be 18 years of old
 
04:44:04.788 --> 04:44:04.798 align:start position:0%
a of age you need to be a qualified
 
04:44:07.070 --> 04:44:07.080 align:start position:0%
voter you need to be a citizen of the
 
04:44:10.350 --> 04:44:10.360 align:start position:0%
United States and you need to actually
 
04:44:14.350 --> 04:44:14.360 align:start position:0%
reside where you say you do put that in
 
04:44:17.030 --> 04:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
the Constitution it just tightens up the
 
04:44:20.628 --> 04:44:20.638 align:start position:0%
entire legal
 
04:44:23.830 --> 04:44:23.840 align:start position:0%
process very short very sweet right to
 
04:44:26.628 --> 04:44:26.638 align:start position:0%
the point just a couple of
 
04:44:29.390 --> 04:44:29.400 align:start position:0%
lines and I'll be happy to answer any
 
04:44:31.390 --> 04:44:31.400 align:start position:0%

law if we have my apologies I just don't
 
04:45:27.788 --> 04:45:27.798 align:start position:0%
remember it but I I don't believe we've
 
04:45:32.270 --> 04:45:32.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:35.990 --> 04:45:36.000 align:start position:0%

thank thank you representative Barry
 
04:45:41.470 --> 04:45:41.480 align:start position:0%
things things are kind of confusing this
 
04:45:44.670 --> 04:45:44.680 align:start position:0%
year um I I just realized I signed in
 
04:45:47.150 --> 04:45:47.160 align:start position:0%
the wrong blue sheet so anyway here I am
 
04:45:48.948 --> 04:45:48.958 align:start position:0%
I've got you've got my card so thank you
 
04:45:51.510 --> 04:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
for this opportunity to speak I'm Liz
 
04:45:53.788 --> 04:45:53.798 align:start position:0%
tentarelli I live in Manchester I'm
 
04:45:56.670 --> 04:45:56.680 align:start position:0%
president of the League of Women Voters
 
04:45:58.990 --> 04:45:59.000 align:start position:0%
uh we're a nonpartisan organization and
 
04:46:03.230 --> 04:46:03.240 align:start position:0%
one of our U self-imposed obligations is
 
04:46:06.270 --> 04:46:06.280 align:start position:0%
that when a a constitutional amendment
 
04:46:09.510 --> 04:46:09.520 align:start position:0%
comes up we try to explain it to voters
 
04:46:11.590 --> 04:46:11.600 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately the way our ballots
 
04:46:14.070 --> 04:46:14.080 align:start position:0%
are set up nobody quite knows what the
 
04:46:17.390 --> 04:46:17.400 align:start position:0%
change is and it's it's a real challenge
 
04:46:19.150 --> 04:46:19.160 align:start position:0%
for voters to understand what they're
 
04:46:19.160 --> 04:46:20.070 align:start position:0%
for voters to understand what they're
voting

04:46:20.070 --> 04:46:20.080 align:start position:0%
voting
 
04:46:24.750 --> 04:46:24.760 align:start position:0%
for in this case I'm opposing the bill
 
04:46:28.470 --> 04:46:28.480 align:start position:0%
itself because of the term legal
 
04:46:31.030 --> 04:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
resident because I think most people
 
04:46:33.070 --> 04:46:33.080 align:start position:0%
don't know what that
 
04:46:36.910 --> 04:46:36.920 align:start position:0%
means for instance is a homeless person
 
04:46:40.070 --> 04:46:40.080 align:start position:0%
a legal resident we know that they are
 
04:46:42.628 --> 04:46:42.638 align:start position:0%
allowed to vote and they can use their
 
04:46:47.150 --> 04:46:47.160 align:start position:0%
social service agency as an address to
 
04:46:50.230 --> 04:46:50.240 align:start position:0%
vote we know that somebody who's incar
 
04:46:52.548 --> 04:46:52.558 align:start position:0%
incarcerated in a House of
 
04:46:55.070 --> 04:46:55.080 align:start position:0%
Corrections is allowed to
 
04:46:57.910 --> 04:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
vote uh either while a waiting trial or
 
04:47:01.390 --> 04:47:01.400 align:start position:0%
while serving a misdemeanor sentence are
 
04:47:05.150 --> 04:47:05.160 align:start position:0%
they a legal resident it's it's just a
 
04:47:08.510 --> 04:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
weird phrase what about the young person
 
04:47:12.470 --> 04:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
who is a roommate and has no uh name on
 
04:47:16.110 --> 04:47:16.120 align:start position:0%
a lease somebody else has the lease he's
 
04:47:18.788 --> 04:47:18.798 align:start position:0%
a roommate uh you know my grandson was
 
04:47:21.150 --> 04:47:21.160 align:start position:0%
in that position for a couple of
 
04:47:25.910 --> 04:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
years is he a a legal resident so I
 
04:47:28.910 --> 04:47:28.920 align:start position:0%
think when you start putting in words
 
04:47:31.910 --> 04:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
that the average voter is going to
 
04:47:34.628 --> 04:47:34.638 align:start position:0%
scratch one's head about and and just
 
04:47:37.628 --> 04:47:37.638 align:start position:0%
not know what it means that that doesn't
 
04:47:37.638 --> 04:47:38.788 align:start position:0%
not know what it means that that doesn't
help

04:47:38.788 --> 04:47:38.798 align:start position:0%
help
 
04:47:42.750 --> 04:47:42.760 align:start position:0%
anything uh this this amendment uh I'm
 
04:47:45.350 --> 04:47:45.360 align:start position:0%
sorry the the the wording that already
 
04:47:49.470 --> 04:47:49.480 align:start position:0%
exists clearly says you need to be you
 
04:47:51.990 --> 04:47:52.000 align:start position:0%
you need to be domiciled you you're
 
04:47:54.430 --> 04:47:54.440 align:start position:0%
there you have to be a citizen you have
 
04:47:57.708 --> 04:47:57.718 align:start position:0%
to be 18 you know we we we know this
 
04:48:01.230 --> 04:48:01.240 align:start position:0%
already and so I think all this does is
 
04:48:01.240 --> 04:48:02.708 align:start position:0%
already and so I think all this does is
create

04:48:02.708 --> 04:48:02.718 align:start position:0%
create
 
04:48:05.070 --> 04:48:05.080 align:start position:0%
confusion and I think I don't
 
04:48:06.830 --> 04:48:06.840 align:start position:0%
particularly want to take questions on
 
04:48:08.510 --> 04:48:08.520 align:start position:0%
this but thank you for the opportunity
 
04:48:10.230 --> 04:48:10.240 align:start position:0%
to speak you are the first one this year
 
04:48:12.390 --> 04:48:12.400 align:start position:0%
not to take question and I love that I
 
04:48:14.310 --> 04:48:14.320 align:start position:0%
love that there's
 
04:48:17.150 --> 04:48:17.160 align:start position:0%
take better it's awesome all right next
 
04:48:25.230 --> 04:48:25.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:32.548 --> 04:48:32.558 align:start position:0%

04:48:49.590 --> 04:48:49.600 align:start position:0%
committee and a board member on open
 
04:48:52.270 --> 04:48:52.280 align:start position:0%
democracy so he says I write an
 
04:48:56.070 --> 04:48:56.080 align:start position:0%
opposition to cacr 4 the cacr makes
 
04:48:57.868 --> 04:48:57.878 align:start position:0%
major changes of consequence for voting
 
04:48:59.590 --> 04:48:59.600 align:start position:0%
under the New Hampshire Constitution as
 
04:49:01.708 --> 04:49:01.718 align:start position:0%
it currently exists the proposed
 
04:49:03.310 --> 04:49:03.320 align:start position:0%
amendment removes references to
 
04:49:05.270 --> 04:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
inhabitants dating back to the original
 
04:49:06.390 --> 04:49:06.400 align:start position:0%
language in
 
04:49:09.270 --> 04:49:09.280 align:start position:0%
1784 defining inhabitant as a person who
 
04:49:12.070 --> 04:49:12.080 align:start position:0%
has a domicile I suggest the founders
 
04:49:14.110 --> 04:49:14.120 align:start position:0%
recognize the mobile nature of settlers
 
04:49:15.830 --> 04:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
so chose not to confine them to a
 
04:49:17.708 --> 04:49:17.718 align:start position:0%
standard of permanency by way of
 
04:49:20.110 --> 04:49:20.120 align:start position:0%
residency such that any definition of
 
04:49:21.628 --> 04:49:21.638 align:start position:0%
residency could account for the
 
04:49:23.310 --> 04:49:23.320 align:start position:0%
movements of the early settlers in
 
04:49:25.948 --> 04:49:25.958 align:start position:0%
search of safety home or job any more
 
04:49:28.430 --> 04:49:28.440 align:start position:0%
than the movements of modern persons
 
04:49:30.510 --> 04:49:30.520 align:start position:0%
there is no definition of quote legal
 
04:49:32.390 --> 04:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
resident or its derivatives in the
 
04:49:34.670 --> 04:49:34.680 align:start position:0%
amendment therefore the intent of the
 
04:49:36.110 --> 04:49:36.120 align:start position:0%
amendment would be subject to a
 
04:49:38.390 --> 04:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
definition determined by the legislature
 
04:49:40.390 --> 04:49:40.400 align:start position:0%
after the amendment were to become law
 
04:49:42.788 --> 04:49:42.798 align:start position:0%
thus adding ambiguity potential surprise
 
04:49:45.628 --> 04:49:45.638 align:start position:0%
or remorse there is a definition of
 
04:49:47.310 --> 04:49:47.320 align:start position:0%
Resident and its derivatives in the
 
04:49:50.948 --> 04:49:50.958 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle statute at RSA 21 but such
 
04:49:52.788 --> 04:49:52.798 align:start position:0%
statute does and should not bear a
 
04:49:54.190 --> 04:49:54.200 align:start position:0%
connection between the privilege of
 
04:49:56.030 --> 04:49:56.040 align:start position:0%
driving a motor vehicle and the
 
04:49:58.110 --> 04:49:58.120 align:start position:0%

requirements for voting that a person
 
04:50:11.350 --> 04:50:11.360 align:start position:0%
must be a citizen of the US and the

requisite fors for voting amply set out
 
04:50:15.548 --> 04:50:15.558 align:start position:0%
those requirements with penalties for

of the word resident conflicts with the

their domicile under RSA 6541 for
 
04:50:38.910 --> 04:50:38.920 align:start position:0%
purposes of voting the amendment would
 
04:50:40.628 --> 04:50:40.638 align:start position:0%
also be problematic to overseas vot

a potential for other appeals not
 
04:51:32.830 --> 04:51:32.840 align:start position:0%
noticed here I urge
 
04:51:36.390 --> 04:51:36.400 align:start position:0%
itl and me speaking as myself I also
 
04:51:38.270 --> 04:51:38.280 align:start position:0%
just wanted to add that as I mentioned
 
04:51:40.750 --> 04:51:40.760 align:start position:0%
previously I am a Durham voter and
 
04:51:43.548 --> 04:51:43.558 align:start position:0%
student at UNH although I am from
 
04:51:46.070 --> 04:51:46.080 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts I do actually reside in
 
04:51:48.910 --> 04:51:48.920 align:start position:0%
the place I claim as domicile for 10 out
 
04:51:50.590 --> 04:51:50.600 align:start position:0%
of the 12 months of the year probably
 
04:51:53.230 --> 04:51:53.240 align:start position:0%
more um I spend way more of my time in
 
04:51:55.830 --> 04:51:55.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and its laws affect me way
 
04:51:58.788 --> 04:51:58.798 align:start position:0%
more than Massachusetts do and it makes
 
04:52:01.270 --> 04:52:01.280 align:start position:0%
more sense for me to vote there I also
 
04:52:03.708 --> 04:52:03.718 align:start position:0%
plan to move here postgraduation and
 
04:52:06.350 --> 04:52:06.360 align:start position:0%
countless others like me are in the same
 
04:52:08.590 --> 04:52:08.600 align:start position:0%
situation so I am worried that the
 
04:52:10.510 --> 04:52:10.520 align:start position:0%
language actually leaves too much room
 
04:52:11.708 --> 04:52:11.718 align:start position:0%
room for
 
04:52:13.548 --> 04:52:13.558 align:start position:0%
interpretation thank
 
04:52:16.350 --> 04:52:16.360 align:start position:0%
you will you be taking questions uh sure
 
04:52:18.150 --> 04:52:18.160 align:start position:0%
all right are other questions from the
 
04:52:21.110 --> 04:52:21.120 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you last up
 
04:52:23.350 --> 04:52:23.360 align:start position:0%
we have Olivia zinc with open

04:52:25.638 --> 04:52:27.788 align:start position:0%
democracy um
representative

04:52:27.788 --> 04:52:27.798 align:start position:0%

04:52:36.750 --> 04:52:36.760 align:start position:0%
I'm standing between you and leaving so
 
04:52:38.430 --> 04:52:38.440 align:start position:0%
I'll be quick it's it's a dangerous
 
04:52:40.190 --> 04:52:40.200 align:start position:0%
place the only other worth place to be
 
04:52:40.200 --> 04:52:41.270 align:start position:0%
place the only other worth place to be
is

04:52:41.270 --> 04:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:52:43.628 --> 04:52:43.638 align:start position:0%
that's that's that's like whoa um I'm
 
04:52:45.430 --> 04:52:45.440 align:start position:0%
Olivia zinc executive director of open
 
04:52:47.070 --> 04:52:47.080 align:start position:0%
democracy and I live in Franklin New
 
04:52:49.150 --> 04:52:49.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um and I'm Po and here
 
04:52:51.430 --> 04:52:51.440 align:start position:0%
opposing this bill currently um the
 
04:52:54.270 --> 04:52:54.280 align:start position:0%
Constitution um guarantees the freedom
 
04:52:56.270 --> 04:52:56.280 align:start position:0%
of all inhabitants that are 18 years
 
04:52:59.670 --> 04:52:59.680 align:start position:0%
older and citizens um the ability to
 
04:53:01.628 --> 04:53:01.638 align:start position:0%
vote in New Hampshire and I think it's
 
04:53:03.830 --> 04:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
important that we make sure that we're
 
04:53:07.788 --> 04:53:07.798 align:start position:0%
not um unintentionally harming any voter
 
04:53:09.910 --> 04:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
um as mentioned before it could be
 
04:53:11.510 --> 04:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
somebody home Hess it could be somebody
 
04:53:13.350 --> 04:53:13.360 align:start position:0%
that's recently divorced and staying on
 
04:53:15.750 --> 04:53:15.760 align:start position:0%
a friend's couch um there are many
 
04:53:19.030 --> 04:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
different uh way reasons where somebody
 
04:53:20.510 --> 04:53:20.520 align:start position:0%
may not
 
04:53:23.150 --> 04:53:23.160 align:start position:0%
um uh have a legal
 
04:53:25.910 --> 04:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
resident uh I was just wondering what is
 
04:53:27.788 --> 04:53:27.798 align:start position:0%
a legal resident in New Hampshire so I
 
04:53:30.070 --> 04:53:30.080 align:start position:0%
looked elderly voters are residents of
 
04:53:32.590 --> 04:53:32.600 align:start position:0%
nursing homes under RSA
 
04:53:35.430 --> 04:53:35.440 align:start position:0%
151 and we know that elderly voters can
 
04:53:37.390 --> 04:53:37.400 align:start position:0%
vote from their nursing home or from
 
04:53:40.548 --> 04:53:40.558 align:start position:0%
their previous home um we allow them
 
04:53:44.310 --> 04:53:44.320 align:start position:0%
that uh Choice um in our election laws
 
04:53:47.310 --> 04:53:47.320 align:start position:0%
so we'd have to change those statutes if
 
04:53:50.350 --> 04:53:50.360 align:start position:0%
we make them a legal resident and and
 
04:53:52.548 --> 04:53:52.558 align:start position:0%
and uh no longer elderly voters would
 
04:53:56.628 --> 04:53:56.638 align:start position:0%
have that choice um and then what is
 
04:54:01.030 --> 04:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
what is uh legal residents when you are
 
04:54:04.548 --> 04:54:04.558 align:start position:0%
purchasing um a house or leasing a
 
04:54:07.310 --> 04:54:07.320 align:start position:0%
leasing an apartment those are different
 
04:54:10.390 --> 04:54:10.400 align:start position:0%
rsas around residency and there's the
 
04:54:13.310 --> 04:54:13.320 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle residency statute there is
 
04:54:15.030 --> 04:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
placing dependent children in publicly
 
04:54:17.470 --> 04:54:17.480 align:start position:0%
funded schools statute and then there is
 
04:54:19.470 --> 04:54:19.480 align:start position:0%
a whole host of statutes about what is
 
04:54:21.670 --> 04:54:21.680 align:start position:0%
your residency under Health and Human
 
04:54:23.548 --> 04:54:23.558 align:start position:0%
Services I've cited all of these
 
04:54:26.470 --> 04:54:26.480 align:start position:0%
different statutes of what is residency
 
04:54:27.948 --> 04:54:27.958 align:start position:0%
because I think it's important for us to
 
04:54:30.230 --> 04:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
know which one of these residency
 
04:54:32.788 --> 04:54:32.798 align:start position:0%
standards would be what we would be
 
04:54:35.910 --> 04:54:35.920 align:start position:0%
defining to vote for folks to vote under
 
04:54:38.430 --> 04:54:38.440 align:start position:0%
this this proposed amendment I urge the
 
04:54:41.030 --> 04:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
committee uh to to support
 
04:54:43.310 --> 04:54:43.320 align:start position:0%
um everybody's freedom to vote and and
 
04:54:45.430 --> 04:54:45.440 align:start position:0%
vote itl on this Constitutional
 
04:54:46.990 --> 04:54:47.000 align:start position:0%
Amendment with that thank you and I
 
04:54:49.510 --> 04:54:49.520 align:start position:0%
won't take questions oh yes all right
 
04:54:51.548 --> 04:54:51.558 align:start position:0%
double up no questions today all right
 
04:54:53.510 --> 04:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
uh we have no one else uh no other pink
 
04:54:55.948 --> 04:54:55.958 align:start position:0%
cards in my possession um uh there was
 
04:54:57.510 --> 04:54:57.520 align:start position:0%
one person on the blue sheet signed up
 
04:54:59.430 --> 04:54:59.440 align:start position:0%
against who did not speak online there
 
04:55:02.310 --> 04:55:02.320 align:start position:0%
was 110 in support and 95 opposed which
 
04:55:04.350 --> 04:55:04.360 align:start position:0%
is why I thought this one would go a lot
 
04:55:08.150 --> 04:55:08.160 align:start position:0%
longer um so um my apologies I probably
 
04:55:09.350 --> 04:55:09.360 align:start position:0%
would have put in two more bills if I
 
04:55:10.350 --> 04:55:10.360 align:start position:0%
knew we were going to fly through this
 
04:55:12.310 --> 04:55:12.320 align:start position:0%
this one um we're done for the day close
 
04:55:15.270 --> 04:55:15.280 align:start position:0%
to public cacr 4 um quick some quick
 
04:55:17.070 --> 04:55:17.080 align:start position:0%
announcements uh yes we are meeting next
 
04:55:20.230 --> 04:55:20.240 align:start position:0%
Tuesday um yes uh every Bill we heard
 
04:55:22.910 --> 04:55:22.920 align:start position:0%
today so the Cadence will be the bills
 
04:55:26.070 --> 04:55:26.080 align:start position:0%
we hear on Tuesday will be by default
 
04:55:29.390 --> 04:55:29.400 align:start position:0%
noticed um for the next Tuesday so that
 
04:55:30.948 --> 04:55:30.958 align:start position:0%
that'll be kind of the Cadence so if
 
04:55:33.310 --> 04:55:33.320 align:start position:0%
there's a bill that needs work right you
