00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:45.419 align:start position:0%
location
 
00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:49.199 align:start position:0%
this uh this lease um we're seeking for
 
00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 align:start position:0%
10 years based on a couple of factors
 
00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 align:start position:0%
one being cost savings as proposed by
 
00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 align:start position:0%
the landlord
 
00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:56.990 align:start position:0%
the landlord
um

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 align:start position:0%
at the best rate which at this current
 
00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 align:start position:0%
rate based on the proposal that was
 
00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:05.639 align:start position:0%
provided uh 13.25 cents a square foot
 
00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 align:start position:0%
Which is far below market value within
 
00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 align:start position:0%
the Concord area
 
00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
we've been at this building for
 
00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780 align:start position:0%
approximately 30 years
 
00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:18.600 align:start position:0%
um in the last few years we have
 
00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:21.540 align:start position:0%
on a couple of occasions sought an RFP
 
00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:24.479 align:start position:0%
for additional space as you might recall
 
00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120 align:start position:0%
we were dread the department of resource
 
00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:29.699 align:start position:0%
and economic development in 2017 that
 
00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:30.969 align:start position:0%
and economic development in 2017 that
changed

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:30.979 align:start position:0%
changed
 
00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 align:start position:0%
we did seek an RFP for lease base at the
 
00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 align:start position:0%
time that nothing materialized that even
 
00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:40.400 align:start position:0%
came close so we sought an extension
 
00:05:43.249 --> 00:05:43.259 align:start position:0%
then we went out one more time two years
 
00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 align:start position:0%
later again we delayed sought an
 
00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:46.490 align:start position:0%
later again we delayed sought an
extension

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:46.500 align:start position:0%
extension
 
00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:49.139 align:start position:0%
uh I'm sorry we had a one year request
 
00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
and then a two-year uh seeking an
 
00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
extension uh this time around we have
 
00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:56.820 align:start position:0%
decided to pursue a lease to stay for a
 
00:05:59.090 --> 00:05:59.100 align:start position:0%
period of time
 
00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:00.780 align:start position:0%
um with under the guidance of
 
00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
administrative Services we did receive a
 
00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:04.919 align:start position:0%
waiver from the RFP process due to the
 
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
circumstances and the information
 
00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:10.340 align:start position:0%
relative to costs in particular that is
 
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
13.25 cents a square foot is far below a
 
00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:16.919 align:start position:0%
cost for any
 
00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
similar space in the Concord area
 
00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:22.620 align:start position:0%
and for that reason we were able to
 
00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:28.309 --> 00:06:28.319 align:start position:0%

years what happened is it um
 
00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:55.620 align:start position:0%
it was a habitability problem not
 
00:14:56.990 --> 00:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
because of the condition of the
 
00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:00.060 align:start position:0%
structure but because of the well the
 
00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
well dried up and looking at what we
 
00:15:05.509 --> 00:15:05.519 align:start position:0%

00:15:08.949 --> 00:15:08.959 align:start position:0%
to what we'd have to do to
 
00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:11.940 align:start position:0%
get the well bat we'd have to drill a
 
00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
new well it was determined that it
 
00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:16.740 align:start position:0%
wasn't so that explains he has his uh
 
00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:17.509 align:start position:0%

yes the department
 
00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
um is requesting to withdraw this item
 
00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
at this time uh it was sent over
 
00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:19.490 align:start position:0%
at this time uh it was sent over
prematurely

00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:19.500 align:start position:0%
prematurely
 
00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:20.150 align:start position:0%
prematurely
um

00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:20.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:23.880 align:start position:0%
what what happened is uh looking at the
 
00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:26.700 align:start position:0%
property and its development potential
 
00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:30.620 align:start position:0%
it was determined that by increasing uh
 
00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
basically we were reserving a truck
 
00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:35.880 align:start position:0%
turnaround area but it wasn't really
 
00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:38.280 align:start position:0%
necessary because there's area up
 
00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:40.740 align:start position:0%
further up the road that trucks can turn
 
00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
around on and by increasing the area of
 
00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
uh it would also help with the
 
00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
development potential of the parcel uh
 
00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:55.020 align:start position:0%
the problem is this was sent over and I
 
00:21:56.330 --> 00:21:56.340 align:start position:0%
should have caught it because I signed
 
00:21:59.630 --> 00:21:59.640 align:start position:0%
off on it so I'm I'm this is on me it
 
00:22:03.289 --> 00:22:03.299 align:start position:0%
was sent over because we still are in
 
00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:05.880 align:start position:0%
the figuring it out mode as to what the
 
00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
increase in area does to
 
00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:11.100 align:start position:0%
the value of the property
 
00:22:13.789 --> 00:22:13.799 align:start position:0%
all right what should we table it no
 
00:22:15.409 --> 00:22:15.419 align:start position:0%
they withdrew it so we're not going to
 
00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
do anything with it
 
00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:20.940 align:start position:0%
um and I assume that at some future
 
00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:23.029 align:start position:0%
um and I assume that at some future

00:25:56.990 --> 00:25:57.000 align:start position:0%
have been discussions with uh solar
 
00:25:59.210 --> 00:25:59.220 align:start position:0%
developer New Hampshire solar garden to
 
00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:02.700 align:start position:0%
ground lease the site and uh develop it
 
00:26:05.269 --> 00:26:05.279 align:start position:0%
into a solar commercial solar generation
 
00:26:09.289 --> 00:26:09.299 align:start position:0%
facility uh I I when I prepared this
 
00:26:11.810 --> 00:26:11.820 align:start position:0%
request I had understood that the
 
00:26:14.090 --> 00:26:14.100 align:start position:0%
generation capacity would be one to five
 
00:26:16.010 --> 00:26:16.020 align:start position:0%
megawatts I'm now told that the
 
00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:19.020 align:start position:0%
expectation is it will be two megawatts
 
00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:19.909 align:start position:0%
expectation is it will be two megawatts
um

00:26:19.909 --> 00:26:19.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:22.140 align:start position:0%
so you know that does affect the rent a
 
00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:23.880 align:start position:0%
bit if you look at the rent formula it's
 
00:26:25.669 --> 00:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
the rent over time for the first 25
 
00:26:28.610 --> 00:26:28.620 align:start position:0%
years it's fixed well it's it's it's a
 
00:26:30.409 --> 00:26:30.419 align:start position:0%
fixed formula uh ten thousand dollars
 
00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:32.340 align:start position:0%
times whatever the nameplate generation
 
00:26:34.130 --> 00:26:34.140 align:start position:0%
capacity is so if it's two megawatts
 
00:26:35.570 --> 00:26:35.580 align:start position:0%
it's going to be twenty thousand dollars
 
00:26:38.149 --> 00:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
you know annually for the first 25 years
 
00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
but after the first 25 years the
 
00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:42.360 align:start position:0%
extension periods under the lease uh the
 
00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:44.760 align:start position:0%
amount of rent uh increases first by 25
 
00:26:47.390 --> 00:26:47.400 align:start position:0%
then by another five percent then by
 
00:26:49.610 --> 00:26:49.620 align:start position:0%
another five percent over five uh
 
00:26:52.130 --> 00:26:52.140 align:start position:0%
successive five-year extension terms
 
00:26:55.010 --> 00:26:55.020 align:start position:0%
um there is a two-year option period at
 
00:26:56.570 --> 00:26:56.580 align:start position:0%
the beginning of this agreement so the
 
00:26:59.029 --> 00:26:59.039 align:start position:0%
lease wouldn't actually start until the
 
00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:01.860 align:start position:0%
developer exercised the option to lease
 
00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:04.440 align:start position:0%
the property the reason for that is as I
 
00:27:06.169 --> 00:27:06.179 align:start position:0%
tried to explain in the letter
 
00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
um the the the lessee is a special
 
00:27:11.029 --> 00:27:11.039 align:start position:0%
purpose entity that's designed for
 
00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:14.100 align:start position:0%
transfer to the operator investor in the
 
00:27:16.610 --> 00:27:16.620 align:start position:0%
site so New Hampshire solar garden is
 
00:27:18.529 --> 00:27:18.539 align:start position:0%
the developer they they line up all the
 
00:27:19.850 --> 00:27:19.860 align:start position:0%
pieces and the money and then they get
 
00:27:22.190 --> 00:27:22.200 align:start position:0%
the owner to come in they find an owner
 
00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:25.140 align:start position:0%
to come in take over the the lessee
 
00:27:29.390 --> 00:27:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:36.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Warren the first question that
 
00:27:39.769 --> 00:27:39.779 align:start position:0%
comes to my mind is has anybody talked
 
00:27:43.850 --> 00:27:43.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:48.649 --> 00:27:48.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:50.330 --> 00:27:50.340 align:start position:0%
she could identify yourself good morning
 
00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:51.960 align:start position:0%
I'm Michael Summerlin with the New
 
00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:53.220 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Environmental
 
00:27:57.529 --> 00:27:57.539 align:start position:0%
Services I'm the project manager for the
 
00:27:59.810 --> 00:27:59.820 align:start position:0%
Sylvester Superfund Site on Gilson Road
 
00:28:01.490 --> 00:28:01.500 align:start position:0%
in Nashua
 
00:28:03.409 --> 00:28:03.419 align:start position:0%
in the process of
 
00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
learning how to lease out state owned
 
00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:07.250 align:start position:0%
learning how to lease out state owned
property

00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:07.260 align:start position:0%
property
 
00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:10.260 align:start position:0%
we went through the cord
 
00:28:14.029 --> 00:28:14.039 align:start position:0%
review and as part of that we received
 
00:28:17.269 --> 00:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
letter of support from Nashua the folks
 
00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
I've talked to in Nashua are very
 
00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:20.330 align:start position:0%
I've talked to in Nashua are very
supportive

00:28:20.330 --> 00:28:20.340 align:start position:0%
supportive
 
00:28:23.450 --> 00:28:23.460 align:start position:0%
of solar and
 
00:28:26.690 --> 00:28:26.700 align:start position:0%
okay so thank you because we always are
 
00:28:29.269 --> 00:28:29.279 align:start position:0%
sensitive to what we're doing to towns
 
00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:31.020 align:start position:0%
and cities where we
 
00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:33.360 align:start position:0%
do something with property within their
 
00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:34.430 align:start position:0%
do something with property within their
boundaries

00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:34.440 align:start position:0%
boundaries
 
00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:40.370 --> 00:28:40.380 align:start position:0%
um do you know if any of this
 
00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:42.240 align:start position:0%
electricity is actually going to come to
 
00:28:43.549 --> 00:28:43.559 align:start position:0%
ensure is it going to go down to the
 
00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
I don't think that I can answer that
 
00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:53.880 align:start position:0%
with the exception of my familiarity
 
00:28:58.010 --> 00:28:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:01.370 --> 00:29:01.380 align:start position:0%
I understand they do primarily net
 
00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:03.720 align:start position:0%
metering which I think means it goes low
 
00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:05.220 align:start position:0%
stays local
 
00:29:07.730 --> 00:29:07.740 align:start position:0%
but I'm not really sure how the solar
 
00:29:09.289 --> 00:29:09.299 align:start position:0%
aspect works
 
00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
the advantage of developing a Superfund
 
00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
Site for solar is that it reduces the
 
00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:17.340 align:start position:0%
potential for exposure
 
00:29:22.909 --> 00:29:22.919 align:start position:0%
brought from for human risks uh with com
 
00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:24.120 align:start position:0%
you know when you compare it to other
 
00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:26.220 align:start position:0%
types of development
 
00:29:29.029 --> 00:29:29.039 align:start position:0%
this particular Superfund Site is a cap
 
00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
surrounded by a fence
 
00:29:33.710 --> 00:29:33.720 align:start position:0%
about 20 acre cap and
 
00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
there aren't a lot of ways of
 
00:29:39.010 --> 00:29:39.020 align:start position:0%
beneficially reusing this site
 
00:29:42.049 --> 00:29:42.059 align:start position:0%
solar has a win-win because now someone
 
00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:43.740 align:start position:0%
else will take care of the fence now
 
00:29:44.690 --> 00:29:44.700 align:start position:0%
someone else will take care of the
 
00:29:46.669 --> 00:29:46.679 align:start position:0%
mowing instead of the Des
 
00:29:48.409 --> 00:29:48.419 align:start position:0%
that'll help out a lot
 
00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up and I I get the cap
 
00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:55.200 align:start position:0%
issue and I'm fine fine with that my
 
00:29:57.409 --> 00:29:57.419 align:start position:0%
concern is New Hampshire has always been
 
00:30:00.110 --> 00:30:00.120 align:start position:0%
on the um the bottom of the totem pole
 
00:30:02.570 --> 00:30:02.580 align:start position:0%
for electricity I want to make sure this
 
00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:04.500 align:start position:0%
electricity is going to benefit our
 
00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:07.440 align:start position:0%
constituents and not go down into
 
00:30:09.950 --> 00:30:09.960 align:start position:0%
um the the grid and then get spread out
 
00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
amongst Maine New Hampshire and
 
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.430 align:start position:0%
amongst Maine New Hampshire and
Connecticut

00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
Connecticut
 
00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:20.690 --> 00:30:20.700 align:start position:0%
well we can ask and get back to you if
 
00:30:22.010 --> 00:30:22.020 align:start position:0%
that helps
 
00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:23.880 align:start position:0%
what's the process for getting back to
 
00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:25.850 align:start position:0%
what's the process for getting back to
you

00:30:25.850 --> 00:30:25.860 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:30:29.450 --> 00:30:29.460 align:start position:0%
Dr Senator Birdsall afterward to get her
 
00:30:33.409 --> 00:30:33.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:38.049 --> 00:30:38.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:40.850 --> 00:30:40.860 align:start position:0%
go ahead Mark
 
00:30:43.610 --> 00:30:43.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so how time
 
00:30:45.950 --> 00:30:45.960 align:start position:0%
sensitive is this lease it would seem to
 
00:30:47.690 --> 00:30:47.700 align:start position:0%
be an appropriate question by the
 
00:30:50.269 --> 00:30:50.279 align:start position:0%
Senators is something we can table to
 
00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:52.260 align:start position:0%
the next meeting how sensitive is this
 
00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:53.750 align:start position:0%
the next meeting how sensitive is this
agreement

00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
00:30:55.970 --> 00:30:55.980 align:start position:0%
time sensitive
 
00:30:59.149 --> 00:30:59.159 align:start position:0%
well from the des's perspective it's not
 
00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
time sensitive the developer
 
00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:05.210 align:start position:0%
time sensitive the developer
has

00:31:05.210 --> 00:31:05.220 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:31:08.210 --> 00:31:08.220 align:start position:0%
stated recently that
 
00:31:11.029 --> 00:31:11.039 align:start position:0%
time is of the essence for
 
00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:14.940 align:start position:0%
keeping the value of the project
 
00:31:16.730 --> 00:31:16.740 align:start position:0%
at the level
 
00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
it's at now to afford the 10 000 per
 
00:31:22.570 --> 00:31:22.580 align:start position:0%
megawatt AC
 
00:31:24.529 --> 00:31:24.539 align:start position:0%
lease agreement
 
00:31:27.230 --> 00:31:27.240 align:start position:0%
a potential lease agreement
 
00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:30.360 align:start position:0%
so there's been changes lately with
 
00:31:32.930 --> 00:31:32.940 align:start position:0%
regard to incentives from the federal
 
00:31:34.730 --> 00:31:34.740 align:start position:0%
government I believe so that probably
 
00:31:38.210 --> 00:31:38.220 align:start position:0%
has softened that deadline that they had
 
00:31:40.010 --> 00:31:40.020 align:start position:0%
but that would be another thing I could
 
00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
learn from the developer and get back to
 
00:31:43.730 --> 00:31:43.740 align:start position:0%
you on
 
00:31:45.889 --> 00:31:45.899 align:start position:0%
our next meeting is already scheduled
 
00:31:47.690 --> 00:31:47.700 align:start position:0%
for two months from now I think that we
 
00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
could get some of those questions
 
00:31:52.010 --> 00:31:52.020 align:start position:0%
answered and maybe ask the department of
 
00:31:53.810 --> 00:31:53.820 align:start position:0%
energy also
 
00:31:56.029 --> 00:31:56.039 align:start position:0%
to come along and talk about this
 
00:31:59.029 --> 00:31:59.039 align:start position:0%
because this is a 45-year lease that
 
00:32:00.529 --> 00:32:00.539 align:start position:0%
deals with
 
00:32:04.970 --> 00:32:04.980 align:start position:0%
um solar and and our constituents and
 
00:32:07.090 --> 00:32:07.100 align:start position:0%
electrical um
 
00:32:15.610 --> 00:32:15.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:19.310 --> 00:32:19.320 align:start position:0%
well geez I missed the question uh there
 
00:32:21.169 --> 00:32:21.179 align:start position:0%
wasn't a question I was just saying that
 
00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:25.320 align:start position:0%
if we were to table this item for two
 
00:32:27.769 --> 00:32:27.779 align:start position:0%
months that I would also expect the
 
00:32:30.769 --> 00:32:30.779 align:start position:0%
department energy to join you in the in
 
00:32:32.389 --> 00:32:32.399 align:start position:0%
this because they they should be the
 
00:32:34.130 --> 00:32:34.140 align:start position:0%
ones to answer
 
00:32:37.010 --> 00:32:37.020 align:start position:0%
um Senator bird seals questions since
 
00:32:41.090 --> 00:32:41.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:46.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:49.850 --> 00:32:49.860 align:start position:0%
any other questions to the Department
 
00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:51.710 align:start position:0%
any other questions to the Department
table

00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:51.720 align:start position:0%
table
 
00:32:54.289 --> 00:32:54.299 align:start position:0%
for you on the table
 
00:32:56.690 --> 00:32:56.700 align:start position:0%
I think it would be prudent okay I moved
 
00:32:57.649 --> 00:32:57.659 align:start position:0%
a table
 
00:32:59.930 --> 00:32:59.940 align:start position:0%
Senator bird Soul moves that we table
 
00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:01.930 align:start position:0%
Senator bird Soul moves that we table
item

00:33:01.930 --> 00:33:01.940 align:start position:0%
item
 
00:33:06.169 --> 00:33:06.179 align:start position:0%
