00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 align:start position:0%
section on Senate Bill 207
 
00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 align:start position:0%
just kind of a review this is the one
 
00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 align:start position:0%
establishes wants to establish a
 
00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:41.820 align:start position:0%
committee to study it
 
00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860 align:start position:0%
and then there's
 
00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.070 align:start position:0%
and then there's
um

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.120 align:start position:0%
some language
 
00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:50.280 align:start position:0%
about emergency medical and Trauma
 
00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
services and
 
00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.070 align:start position:0%
services and
um

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:55.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
and as I understand it the uh
 
00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:01.139 align:start position:0%
the intent is to have them covered by at
 
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:04.620 align:start position:0%
least what we heard covered by as I
 
00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:06.180 align:start position:0%
understand at workman's comp and that
 
00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:08.580 align:start position:0%
somehow that was gonna
 
00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:13.139 align:start position:0%
provide liability protection and um and
 
00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:15.419 align:start position:0%
you know let them maintain
 
00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:18.060 align:start position:0%
confidentiality about you know the
 
00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:19.500 align:start position:0%
people who are providing counseling with
 
00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:21.780 align:start position:0%
the people they're counseling and the
 
00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:24.120 align:start position:0%
questions I had during the public
 
00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:25.249 align:start position:0%
questions I had during the public
hearing

00:06:25.249 --> 00:06:25.259 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:06:28.129 --> 00:06:28.139 align:start position:0%
was it wasn't clear to me I mean I'm I
 
00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:30.300 align:start position:0%
support that but it wasn't clear to me
 
00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:31.620 align:start position:0%
looking at the bill
 
00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:34.860 align:start position:0%
and the statute how the language in this
 
00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:35.749 align:start position:0%
and the statute how the language in this
bill

00:06:35.749 --> 00:06:35.759 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:38.220 align:start position:0%
actually provides
 
00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:40.129 align:start position:0%
actually provides
um

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:40.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
you know liability protection as well as
 
00:06:44.689 --> 00:06:44.699 align:start position:0%
a confidentiality so if there's anybody
 
00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:58.270 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:06:58.270 --> 00:06:58.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:01.020 align:start position:0%
Mr chair members of the subcommittee for
 
00:07:02.809 --> 00:07:02.819 align:start position:0%
the record my name is Brian rill I'm the
 
00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
president of the professional
 
00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:05.660 align:start position:0%
firefighters in New Hampshire
 
00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:08.120 align:start position:0%
how's the last name spell
 
00:07:11.749 --> 00:07:11.759 align:start position:0%
r-y-l-l uh all right
 
00:07:11.759 --> 00:07:14.689 align:start position:0%
r-y-l-l uh all right
and

00:07:14.689 --> 00:07:14.699 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:16.129 --> 00:07:16.139 align:start position:0%
um first and foremost I would like to
 
00:07:17.809 --> 00:07:17.819 align:start position:0%
apologize to the members of the
 
00:07:20.809 --> 00:07:20.819 align:start position:0%
subcommittee I was uh unavailable to be
 
00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:25.020 align:start position:0%
present at the full committee executive
 
00:07:26.629 --> 00:07:26.639 align:start position:0%
session on this to clear up any
 
00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:30.060 align:start position:0%
confusion which uh it was clear that
 
00:07:31.969 --> 00:07:31.979 align:start position:0%
that's the direction it went was it was
 
00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:33.900 align:start position:0%
nothing but confusing uh so that's
 
00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:36.360 align:start position:0%
that's my fault and I apologize
 
00:07:39.589 --> 00:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
um I will start by saying the intent of
 
00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:43.380 align:start position:0%
this uh Bill and I'm only speaking to
 
00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:45.300 align:start position:0%
part two of the bill we have nothing to
 
00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:49.020 align:start position:0%
do with part one part two is the
 
00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:49.930 align:start position:0%
do with part one part two is the
um

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:49.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:53.940 align:start position:0%
the addition of the peer support groups
 
00:07:56.589 --> 00:07:56.599 align:start position:0%
and whatnot underneath the current RSA
 
00:07:59.089 --> 00:07:59.099 align:start position:0%
the intent of this
 
00:08:04.129 --> 00:08:04.139 align:start position:0%
was to just expand upon post-traumatic
 
00:08:06.589 --> 00:08:06.599 align:start position:0%
stress disorder and resources here in
 
00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:09.240 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire so
 
00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:11.580 align:start position:0%
um it's no surprise and and just a quick
 
00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:15.960 align:start position:0%
statistic uh 20 of firefighters
 
00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:18.900 align:start position:0%
um will at some point uh be diagnosed
 
00:08:20.629 --> 00:08:20.639 align:start position:0%
with some form of post-traumatic stress
 
00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:23.280 align:start position:0%
disorder or acute stress disorder and
 
00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:25.800 align:start position:0%
that's from the The Academy of
 
00:08:29.749 --> 00:08:29.759 align:start position:0%
psychology so that's uh That's the basis
 
00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:32.760 align:start position:0%
for why this is so important uh in 2015
 
00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:34.200 align:start position:0%
the International Association of
 
00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:37.020 align:start position:0%
firefighters so I mean hang on yes I'm
 
00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:39.060 align:start position:0%
looking I mean we heard testimony on
 
00:08:41.329 --> 00:08:41.339 align:start position:0%
that I mean and also if anybody in the
 
00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:43.380 align:start position:0%
committee also has questions let me know
 
00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:44.269 align:start position:0%
committee also has questions let me know
but

00:08:44.269 --> 00:08:44.279 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
I'm looking for an answer for a
 
00:08:48.829 --> 00:08:48.839 align:start position:0%
technical question okay which is we
 
00:08:51.889 --> 00:08:51.899 align:start position:0%
heard testimony that passing this bill
 
00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:54.200 align:start position:0%
would provide the liability protection
 
00:08:57.410 --> 00:08:57.420 align:start position:0%
and let the uh you know people providing
 
00:08:59.210 --> 00:08:59.220 align:start position:0%
the peer counseling maintain
 
00:09:02.509 --> 00:09:02.519 align:start position:0%
confidentiality precisely how does
 
00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:06.240 align:start position:0%
passing this do that you know very good
 
00:09:08.329 --> 00:09:08.339 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question I am unsure
 
00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:10.380 align:start position:0%
of that because again that was not the
 
00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
intent of why we submitted it
 
00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:14.940 align:start position:0%
um some folks came up and tried to do
 
00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:17.220 align:start position:0%
some explanation and I think it just
 
00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
over complicated things if if you would
 
00:09:21.949 --> 00:09:21.959 align:start position:0%
allow I'll explain the actual intent of
 
00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
of that piece of the legislation under
 
00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
the current RSA
 
00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:28.260 align:start position:0%
it states that
 
00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.949 align:start position:0%
it states that
um

00:09:30.949 --> 00:09:30.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:33.420 align:start position:0%
make sure I get it right here so a
 
00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:35.700 align:start position:0%
critical incident stress management team
 
00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
means the group of one or more trained
 
00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
volunteers and which RSA are you uh that
 
00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:51.829 --> 00:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
and this is and I'm I'm reading you can
 
00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:54.240 align:start position:0%
read it straight from the amendment and
 
00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
uh I'll just leave out the parts that
 
00:09:58.269 --> 00:09:58.279 align:start position:0%
are looking for Amendment but
 
00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:00.720 align:start position:0%
essentially a critical instance stress
 
00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:03.540 align:start position:0%
management team in New Hampshire has to
 
00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
be organized by a unit of State local or
 
00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:10.980 align:start position:0%
County government to simplify it uh the
 
00:10:12.889 --> 00:10:12.899 align:start position:0%
teams that we have established in the
 
00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:14.100 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire
 
00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:16.140 align:start position:0%
for the professional firefighters of New
 
00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:17.150 align:start position:0%
for the professional firefighters of New
Hampshire

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:17.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
are not organized by a unit of local a
 
00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:23.700 align:start position:0%
unit of State local or County Government
 
00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
this bill is intended to just expand
 
00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:29.700 align:start position:0%
that slightly and allow our organization
 
00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
the professional firefighters of New
 
00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:32.630 align:start position:0%
the professional firefighters of New
Hampshire

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:35.880 align:start position:0%
to utilize their peer support services
 
00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:38.700 align:start position:0%
their peer support group which has been
 
00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
recognized by the commissioner of safety
 
00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:42.540 align:start position:0%
in a letter that you have in front of
 
00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:43.190 align:start position:0%
in a letter that you have in front of
you

00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:43.200 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:44.389 align:start position:0%
you
uh

00:10:44.389 --> 00:10:44.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:10:47.389 --> 00:10:47.399 align:start position:0%
to allow for the protections under this
 
00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:49.980 align:start position:0%
RSA much like any other critical
 
00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:52.260 align:start position:0%
incident stress team in the state
 
00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:55.260 align:start position:0%
so this does two things
 
00:10:58.790 --> 00:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
it expands that language
 
00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
because a union organization is not
 
00:11:03.949 --> 00:11:03.959 align:start position:0%
organized by state local or County
 
00:11:06.949 --> 00:11:06.959 align:start position:0%
government so it expands it to allow our
 
00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:09.560 align:start position:0%
Union to provide peer support services
 
00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:12.720 align:start position:0%
to our members
 
00:11:15.889 --> 00:11:15.899 align:start position:0%
and what that does is it affords us the
 
00:11:19.069 --> 00:11:19.079 align:start position:0%
protections under confidentiality uh
 
00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:21.420 align:start position:0%
further down in
 
00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:25.140 align:start position:0%
the statute where's that you can see it
 
00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:27.230 align:start position:0%
the statute where's that you can see it
under

00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:27.240 align:start position:0%
under
 
00:11:32.449 --> 00:11:32.459 align:start position:0%
3A 150s three dash a
 
00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:35.240 align:start position:0%
so 153
 
00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
a17 a
 
00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:40.440 align:start position:0%
and it would be 3A
 
00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:43.620 align:start position:0%
any information hang on sorry what's the
 
00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:47.160 align:start position:0%
RSA so it's the same RSI I'm rating 53-a
 
00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:48.470 align:start position:0%
RSA so it's the same RSI I'm rating 53-a
yep

00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
yep
 
00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:51.660 align:start position:0%
all right 17 colon uh colon seven colon
 
00:11:53.569 --> 00:11:53.579 align:start position:0%
17. all right hang on all right there it
 
00:11:54.829 --> 00:11:54.839 align:start position:0%
is a
 
00:11:58.790 --> 00:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
and then under there 3A Roman three yep
 
00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:00.600 align:start position:0%
Roman three okay just give me a moment
 
00:12:02.269 --> 00:12:02.279 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:04.380 align:start position:0%
all right any information involves the
 
00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:06.540 align:start position:0%
team or team member
 
00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:13.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:15.470 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:15.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:18.720 align:start position:0%
so all this is looking to do current
 
00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
critical incident stress teams in the
 
00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:21.650 align:start position:0%
critical incident stress teams in the
state

00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:21.660 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:24.660 align:start position:0%
are afforded the protection to have
 
00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
anything divulged to them in their work
 
00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:29.540 align:start position:0%
as confidential so that they're not
 
00:12:33.949 --> 00:12:33.959 align:start position:0%
required to testify or have any third
 
00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
party administrative hearing where they
 
00:12:37.509 --> 00:12:37.519 align:start position:0%
have to share the information
 
00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:39.300 align:start position:0%
yeah and the other thing that was
 
00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:40.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned I don't know if it was correct
 
00:12:42.889 --> 00:12:42.899 align:start position:0%
and that's good because that
 
00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:45.240 align:start position:0%
the person who spoke at the public
 
00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:48.180 align:start position:0%
hearing was was talking about being
 
00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:49.620 align:start position:0%
somehow under workman's comp or
 
00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:50.820 align:start position:0%
something which didn't make any sense
 
00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:52.860 align:start position:0%
but I see this here thank you for that
 
00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:54.110 align:start position:0%
but I see this here thank you for that
sure

00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:54.120 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:12:56.690 --> 00:12:56.700 align:start position:0%
um and also we heard that it provided
 
00:12:59.350 --> 00:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
some kind of liability protection
 
00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:02.940 align:start position:0%
for um you know the the team and is that
 
00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
correct and if so where's that in
 
00:13:08.389 --> 00:13:08.399 align:start position:0%
statute so I think no is the easy answer
 
00:13:10.009 --> 00:13:10.019 align:start position:0%
um I think there may have been some
 
00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:13.380 align:start position:0%
confusion in words between liability and
 
00:13:15.829 --> 00:13:15.839 align:start position:0%
confidentiality basically it affords
 
00:13:17.389 --> 00:13:17.399 align:start position:0%
them the protection of the
 
00:13:17.399 --> 00:13:19.129 align:start position:0%
them the protection of the
confidentiality

00:13:19.129 --> 00:13:19.139 align:start position:0%
confidentiality
 
00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:21.300 align:start position:0%
um which I guess you could interpret as
 
00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:25.500 align:start position:0%
uh a liability but there's no
 
00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:28.740 align:start position:0%
um there's this is a no cost item
 
00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:31.500 align:start position:0%
um it's it's recognized already our team
 
00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:33.000 align:start position:0%
is recognized by the commissioner of
 
00:13:35.389 --> 00:13:35.399 align:start position:0%
safety he was supportive of this change
 
00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
but just was didn't have the authority
 
00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:40.500 align:start position:0%
uh to make it on his own honestly and
 
00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:42.180 align:start position:0%
and the other piece to this is just
 
00:13:45.829 --> 00:13:45.839 align:start position:0%
defining because if you look in again
 
00:13:51.889 --> 00:13:51.899 align:start position:0%
going back to the 153 a17 under number
 
00:13:55.009 --> 00:13:55.019 align:start position:0%
seven where it defines a critical
 
00:13:57.710 --> 00:13:57.720 align:start position:0%
incident stress management team hang on
 
00:14:01.069 --> 00:14:01.079 align:start position:0%
a moment so that's 153 a17
 
00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:04.980 align:start position:0%
yeah it is it is under the amended bill
 
00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:07.260 align:start position:0%
right here
 
00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
uh number seven okay section seven okay
 
00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:15.240 align:start position:0%
yep uh it and then uh under a critical
 
00:14:17.509 --> 00:14:17.519 align:start position:0%
incident stress management team means
 
00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:19.200 align:start position:0%
the group of one or more trained
 
00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:20.940 align:start position:0%
volunteers including members of a peer
 
00:14:23.389 --> 00:14:23.399 align:start position:0%
support group peer support group is not
 
00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:26.100 align:start position:0%
currently defined anywhere in statute uh
 
00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:28.620 align:start position:0%
so the second piece of this if you look
 
00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:32.820 align:start position:0%
below uh to F is just defining peer
 
00:14:35.389 --> 00:14:35.399 align:start position:0%
support group so that
 
00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:39.060 align:start position:0%
it further encompasses the intent of of
 
00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
the the protections under this law
 
00:14:44.449 --> 00:14:44.459 align:start position:0%
okay and so I mean under the bill
 
00:14:46.129 --> 00:14:46.139 align:start position:0%
currently it looks like it refers to as
 
00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:49.260 align:start position:0%
critical incident stress management
 
00:14:52.129 --> 00:14:52.139 align:start position:0%
uh Team yep and it says means the group
 
00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:54.240 align:start position:0%
of one or more trained volunteers
 
00:14:56.629 --> 00:14:56.639 align:start position:0%
including members of peer support groups
 
00:14:59.509 --> 00:14:59.519 align:start position:0%
but nowhere and current statute does it
 
00:15:00.889 --> 00:15:00.899 align:start position:0%
State what a peer support group actually
 
00:15:02.509 --> 00:15:02.519 align:start position:0%
is all right thank you anybody else in
 
00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:05.100 align:start position:0%
the committee have questions
 
00:15:08.389 --> 00:15:08.399 align:start position:0%
I mean that that clears up my confusion
 
00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:11.940 align:start position:0%
and concern so thank you for that sure
 
00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:14.290 align:start position:0%
and concern so thank you for that sure
um

00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:14.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:16.440 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah
 
00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:18.660 align:start position:0%
now the other thing on the and I I mean
 
00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
part two on this I'm I completely
 
00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.129 align:start position:0%
part two on this I'm I completely
support

00:15:22.129 --> 00:15:22.139 align:start position:0%
support
 
00:15:22.139 --> 00:15:23.569 align:start position:0%
support
um

00:15:23.569 --> 00:15:23.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:26.389 --> 00:15:26.399 align:start position:0%
I know uh
 
00:15:29.569 --> 00:15:29.579 align:start position:0%
when I you know generally are not big
 
00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:31.860 align:start position:0%
fans of
 
00:15:34.189 --> 00:15:34.199 align:start position:0%
the committee the first part that sort
 
00:15:35.629 --> 00:15:35.639 align:start position:0%
of thing the first part
 
00:15:35.639 --> 00:15:37.250 align:start position:0%
of thing the first part
um

00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:37.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:39.720 align:start position:0%
creates and
 
00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:41.329 align:start position:0%
creates and
um

00:15:41.329 --> 00:15:41.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:43.500 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire had an amendment
 
00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:45.250 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire had an amendment
that

00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:45.260 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:47.820 align:start position:0%
just took out the study commission and
 
00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:49.500 align:start position:0%
left everything else in that's that's
 
00:15:52.069 --> 00:15:52.079 align:start position:0%
you're okay with that yes okay any other
 
00:15:54.829 --> 00:15:54.839 align:start position:0%
comments on that
 
00:15:54.839 --> 00:15:56.810 align:start position:0%
comments on that
sure

00:15:56.810 --> 00:15:56.820 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:15:59.810 --> 00:15:59.820 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman my my question is
 
00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:02.760 align:start position:0%
so the amendment takes out the study
 
00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:09.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:12.300 align:start position:0%
so the question about the workers comp
 
00:16:15.829 --> 00:16:15.839 align:start position:0%
and how this all works I'm just unsure
 
00:16:17.689 --> 00:16:17.699 align:start position:0%
like how the bill breaks in half I guess
 
00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:19.320 align:start position:0%
it's a logistics question well I think
 
00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:21.660 align:start position:0%
what we just heard is that the person
 
00:16:23.509 --> 00:16:23.519 align:start position:0%
who brought the workman's comp-up thing
 
00:16:25.069 --> 00:16:25.079 align:start position:0%
during the public hearing basically
 
00:16:25.079 --> 00:16:26.210 align:start position:0%
during the public hearing basically
misspoke

00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:26.220 align:start position:0%
misspoke
 
00:16:28.129 --> 00:16:28.139 align:start position:0%
and that has nothing to do with
 
00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
workman's comp
 
00:16:32.509 --> 00:16:32.519 align:start position:0%
that it's actually in further down in
 
00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:34.920 align:start position:0%
the statute which I hadn't read I didn't
 
00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
get that far down in it of 153
 
00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:38.509 align:start position:0%
get that far down in it of 153
um

00:16:38.509 --> 00:16:38.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:40.040 align:start position:0%
yeah I believe
 
00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
a17 and the part we were just going over
 
00:16:45.829 --> 00:16:45.839 align:start position:0%
and if you look at it it deals with the
 
00:16:47.689 --> 00:16:47.699 align:start position:0%
confidentiality thing in there it's it's
 
00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:51.300 align:start position:0%
uh very clear so that satisfied my
 
00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:54.300 align:start position:0%
concern that my concern was that I
 
00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:55.620 align:start position:0%
supported what they want to do my
 
00:16:57.230 --> 00:16:57.240 align:start position:0%
concern was the Bill didn't
 
00:16:59.629 --> 00:16:59.639 align:start position:0%
seem to do what the person was talking
 
00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:01.500 align:start position:0%
about so so I think and they're
 
00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:03.260 align:start position:0%
completely separate so there's no
 
00:17:05.689 --> 00:17:05.699 align:start position:0%
establishing the study committee
 
00:17:08.449 --> 00:17:08.459 align:start position:0%
is not related to the rest of the bill
 
00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
so they're basically independent
 
00:17:14.449 --> 00:17:14.459 align:start position:0%
what's up do you turn your mic on you
 
00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:15.900 align:start position:0%
can talk
 
00:17:18.350 --> 00:17:18.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so is it my
 
00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
understanding then
 
00:17:24.590 --> 00:17:24.600 align:start position:0%
because of the confusion because of the
 
00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
amendment do is it
 
00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:30.360 align:start position:0%
just we're not really making any
 
00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:32.040 align:start position:0%
progress here this is not already I
 
00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:35.220 align:start position:0%
disagree um my intent is to make a
 
00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:38.280 align:start position:0%
motion first to adopt the amendment
 
00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:40.140 align:start position:0%
which gets sort of the study committee
 
00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:41.880 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:43.320 align:start position:0%
um you know I'd be glad to accept or
 
00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
make you know an otpa motion on the
 
00:17:48.169 --> 00:17:48.179 align:start position:0%
underlying bill
 
00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
um so we would remove the study
 
00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:52.020 align:start position:0%
committee part from the bill and keep
 
00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:53.150 align:start position:0%
committee part from the bill and keep
the

00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:53.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:17:55.730 --> 00:17:55.740 align:start position:0%
the part we were just discussing that
 
00:17:58.370 --> 00:17:58.380 align:start position:0%
that puts these peer support groups in
 
00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
statute and therefore they get
 
00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
some Treasury and rights in particular
 
00:18:06.529 --> 00:18:06.539 align:start position:0%
the confidentiality part so
 
00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:10.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:13.860 align:start position:0%
no I'm not no please have a seat
 
00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
if we have questions we'll ask it's not
 
00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
this is not a public hearing
 
00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:20.940 align:start position:0%
I mean if there's a reason to him yeah
 
00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:23.640 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I think that as the chairman
 
00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:24.780 align:start position:0%
has suggested this is pretty simple
 
00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:26.220 align:start position:0%
we're getting rid of the study committee
 
00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:27.780 align:start position:0%
but we're leaving the rest of it in here
 
00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:29.160 align:start position:0%
because it does provide some definitions
 
00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:31.620 align:start position:0%
and some protections it doesn't cost a
 
00:18:34.669 --> 00:18:34.679 align:start position:0%
dime and this is just a good thing to
 
00:18:36.890 --> 00:18:36.900 align:start position:0%
have it's it's a place where these peer
 
00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:39.660 align:start position:0%
support groups were not really laid out
 
00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
in the rsas this basically takes care of
 
00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:44.100 align:start position:0%
that so it's it's I look at it as more
 
00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:45.240 align:start position:0%
of a housekeeping thing than anything
 
00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:47.220 align:start position:0%
else and providing more support to fire
 
00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:49.260 align:start position:0%
services and professionals that are out
 
00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
there working in you know fire police
 
00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:52.620 align:start position:0%

00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:32.580 align:start position:0%
you have to speak into the mic pretty
 
00:19:34.669 --> 00:19:34.679 align:start position:0%
much yes uh good morning Mr chairman
 
00:19:36.289 --> 00:19:36.299 align:start position:0%
members of the subcommittee uh my name
 
00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:37.860 align:start position:0%
is David Goldstein I'm the chief of
 
00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
police in the city of Franklin I've been
 
00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:42.360 align:start position:0%
a police officer for 44 years I've been
 
00:19:43.669 --> 00:19:43.679 align:start position:0%
doing this kind of work for more than
 
00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:45.900 align:start position:0%
that time I actually have a PhD in the
 
00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
subject uh and we're a little bit
 
00:19:50.210 --> 00:19:50.220 align:start position:0%
concerned with some of the language that
 
00:19:53.029 --> 00:19:53.039 align:start position:0%
we're seeing here uh and I am a member
 
00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
of Senator bird sales commission on PTSD
 
00:19:59.090 --> 00:19:59.100 align:start position:0%
as it relates to workers comp
 
00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:01.440 align:start position:0%
so I think that there may be some
 
00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
questions that I may be able to answer
 
00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
as well for you but one of our biggest
 
00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:08.220 align:start position:0%
concerns right now is that the language
 
00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:10.860 align:start position:0%
in hb2 is different than the language in
 
00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:13.980 align:start position:0%
the amendment recommended Amendment uh
 
00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:16.200 align:start position:0%
as far as some of this is concerned
 
00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:19.500 align:start position:0%
so uh we unfortunately and I apologize
 
00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
we did not know that this hearing would
 
00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:22.980 align:start position:0%
be going on our information was that it
 
00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
was going to be suspended for some
 
00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:27.660 align:start position:0%
period of time but uh here we are any
 
00:20:29.450 --> 00:20:29.460 align:start position:0%
questions that I may be able to answer
 
00:20:32.029 --> 00:20:32.039 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to do so I also chair the
 
00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:34.380 align:start position:0%
chief's legislative committee okay
 
00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:35.640 align:start position:0%
um I was unaware there was anything
 
00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
related to this in hb2 yes sir
 
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.270 align:start position:0%
related to this in hb2 yes sir
um

00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:44.029 --> 00:20:44.039 align:start position:0%
if you look at hb2 and this was as
 
00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:47.780 align:start position:0%
amended by the house presumably
 
00:20:54.770 --> 00:20:54.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
was it it was it an HP presumably it was
 
00:20:59.090 --> 00:20:59.100 align:start position:0%
an hb2 has passed by the house that is
 
00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:11.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:14.700 align:start position:0%
um okay and I'll just look for Do you
 
00:21:16.130 --> 00:21:16.140 align:start position:0%
have a
 
00:21:19.130 --> 00:21:19.140 align:start position:0%
a section number where it is I I do uh
 
00:21:21.370 --> 00:21:21.380 align:start position:0%
there are a couple uh again it's under
 
00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
153-a colon 17- small a
 
00:21:28.430 --> 00:21:28.440 align:start position:0%
which I think you've already been aware
 
00:21:30.529 --> 00:21:30.539 align:start position:0%
of yeah yeah I just trying to find it in
 
00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
hb2 as well which is a month and it
 
00:21:36.289 --> 00:21:36.299 align:start position:0%
would be paragraph e and G that we look
 
00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:49.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:53.400 align:start position:0%
a yeah I didn't bring my copy of hb2
 
00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:55.020 align:start position:0%
because I didn't realize this would
 
00:21:56.750 --> 00:21:56.760 align:start position:0%
become an issue
 
00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:03.049 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:22:03.049 --> 00:22:03.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:06.049 --> 00:22:06.059 align:start position:0%
T Dash a
 
00:22:10.549 --> 00:22:10.559 align:start position:0%
okay I've I'm seeing the part where um
 
00:22:13.010 --> 00:22:13.020 align:start position:0%
it's Section 133
 
00:22:14.450 --> 00:22:14.460 align:start position:0%
yes the one you're talking about okay
 
00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:23.390 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:23.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:25.320 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman yep
 
00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:27.720 align:start position:0%
a question um the amendment number that
 
00:22:29.090 --> 00:22:29.100 align:start position:0%
we're looking at can I just have that
 
00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:32.940 align:start position:0%
remember it's 1291 H thank you and
 
00:22:34.430 --> 00:22:34.440 align:start position:0%
really the amendment number just
 
00:22:37.669 --> 00:22:37.679 align:start position:0%
duplicates part two of the bill and so
 
00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
it doesn't include the first it replaces
 
00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:40.440 align:start position:0%
the whole bill
 
00:22:42.649 --> 00:22:42.659 align:start position:0%
it includes part two and everything
 
00:22:45.289 --> 00:22:45.299 align:start position:0%
Beyond everything else basically
 
00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:47.280 align:start position:0%
um which is part two and then uh the
 
00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:49.200 align:start position:0%
effective date so
 
00:22:51.049 --> 00:22:51.059 align:start position:0%
I'm just
 
00:22:53.210 --> 00:22:53.220 align:start position:0%
looking and there is language that looks
 
00:22:55.909 --> 00:22:55.919 align:start position:0%
very similar in hp2 which I don't think
 
00:22:58.430 --> 00:22:58.440 align:start position:0%
any of us were aware of
 
00:22:59.630 --> 00:22:59.640 align:start position:0%
um and so
 
00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
so what
 
00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
um if you can point out what it where is
 
00:23:05.810 --> 00:23:05.820 align:start position:0%
their conflict well our conflict
 
00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:08.820 align:start position:0%
originally comes from section e
 
00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:11.940 align:start position:0%
under a 133 credential critical
 
00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
incidence Stress Management where it
 
00:23:18.289 --> 00:23:18.299 align:start position:0%
talks about employee organization
 
00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:22.140 align:start position:0%
in hb2 whereas in the amendment I have
 
00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:23.450 align:start position:0%
in hb2 whereas in the amendment I have
anyway

00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:23.460 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
00:23:27.409 --> 00:23:27.419 align:start position:0%
uh under Senate Bill 207 it says or
 
00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
members of a union of Emergency Response
 
00:23:32.529 --> 00:23:32.539 align:start position:0%
Public Safety workers as defined by RSA
 
00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:35.940 align:start position:0%
281a2 so we we're a little bit concerned
 
00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
with the right contradiction if there
 
00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:40.200 align:start position:0%
was a choice of I mean are you okay with
 
00:23:42.890 --> 00:23:42.900 align:start position:0%
the language that's in hb2
 
00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:43.669 align:start position:0%
the language that's in hb2
um

00:23:43.669 --> 00:23:43.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:45.480 align:start position:0%
we're a little bit concerned by that
 
00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:46.620 align:start position:0%
because we don't know what that
 
00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:53.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:55.730 --> 00:23:55.740 align:start position:0%
so or employee organizations the concern
 
00:23:57.590 --> 00:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
about so that could be anything Mr
 
00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:01.500 align:start position:0%
chairman that could be the janitors and
 
00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:03.720 align:start position:0%
and please I'm not disrespecting
 
00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:05.640 align:start position:0%
janitors that could be the janitors
 
00:24:09.890 --> 00:24:09.900 align:start position:0%
Union at a school okay
 
00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:11.280 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:11.810 align:start position:0%
all right
um

00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:11.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:14.100 align:start position:0%
and just to add to that if you
 
00:24:17.029 --> 00:24:17.039 align:start position:0%
statutorily now DPW workers are now
 
00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:19.860 align:start position:0%
defined statutorily as First Responders
 
00:24:21.890 --> 00:24:21.900 align:start position:0%
so we're we're a little bit concerned
 
00:24:24.169 --> 00:24:24.179 align:start position:0%
with with the lack of definition if you
 
00:24:24.179 --> 00:24:26.570 align:start position:0%
with with the lack of definition if you
will

00:24:26.570 --> 00:24:26.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:27.890 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:27.900 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:32.149 align:start position:0%
okay
um

00:24:32.149 --> 00:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:34.669 --> 00:24:34.679 align:start position:0%
and our uh are you okay with the
 
00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:36.360 align:start position:0%
language that's in the amendment or do
 
00:24:37.970 --> 00:24:37.980 align:start position:0%
you see problems there as well the
 
00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:39.960 align:start position:0%
amendment has a little bit more strength
 
00:24:42.409 --> 00:24:42.419 align:start position:0%
to it yes a little bit more bite and we
 
00:24:44.810 --> 00:24:44.820 align:start position:0%
we would if we were forced to choose I
 
00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:46.440 align:start position:0%
would I would say we'd probably go with
 
00:24:49.549 --> 00:24:49.559 align:start position:0%
the amendment and but I mean if you had
 
00:24:49.559 --> 00:24:50.570 align:start position:0%
the amendment and but I mean if you had
um

00:24:50.570 --> 00:24:50.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
you know what would be your preferred
 
00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:53.090 align:start position:0%
you know what would be your preferred
language

00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:53.100 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:24:55.490 --> 00:24:55.500 align:start position:0%
our preferred language would actually be
 
00:24:57.950 --> 00:24:57.960 align:start position:0%
to have a definition and I believe the
 
00:24:59.330 --> 00:24:59.340 align:start position:0%
previous speaker brought up the fact
 
00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:01.500 align:start position:0%
that there are some definitions lacking
 
00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
but we would like a definition of what
 
00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:08.220 align:start position:0%
what is meant by that uh
 
00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:10.440 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what they mean by Union of
 
00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:13.370 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what they mean by Union of
okay

00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:13.380 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:16.200 align:start position:0%
um okay just a moment so uh folks on the
 
00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:17.149 align:start position:0%
um okay just a moment so uh folks on the
committee

00:25:17.149 --> 00:25:17.159 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:25:17.159 --> 00:25:20.270 align:start position:0%
committee
I'm

00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:20.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:22.020 align:start position:0%
what we could what I would like to
 
00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:25.020 align:start position:0%
suggest is that um
 
00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:26.520 align:start position:0%
we ask
 
00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:28.620 align:start position:0%
um Mr Goldstein and anybody else
 
00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
interested if they have suggested
 
00:25:32.930 --> 00:25:32.940 align:start position:0%
language for those definitions and then
 
00:25:35.029 --> 00:25:35.039 align:start position:0%
we would I mean we've got two weeks I
 
00:25:37.789 --> 00:25:37.799 align:start position:0%
think before it's going to be exact
 
00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:39.240 align:start position:0%
didn't want to drag people up here again
 
00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:40.740 align:start position:0%
but we could have
 
00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:41.630 align:start position:0%
but we could have
um

00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:41.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:43.850 --> 00:25:43.860 align:start position:0%
a subcommittee meeting to go over that
 
00:25:47.029 --> 00:25:47.039 align:start position:0%
and you know tweak it if need be and
 
00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
come to an agreement and we can have an
 
00:25:50.269 --> 00:25:50.279 align:start position:0%
amendment a different Amendment drafted
 
00:25:52.549 --> 00:25:52.559 align:start position:0%
I I fully agree I think that's the thing
 
00:25:54.289 --> 00:25:54.299 align:start position:0%
to do is get some suggested amount you
 
00:25:56.330 --> 00:25:56.340 align:start position:0%
know wording yes for getting that
 
00:25:57.830 --> 00:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
correction within the amendment that we
 
00:25:59.690 --> 00:25:59.700 align:start position:0%
have here we would be happy to get that
 
00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
taken care of I was unaware of the sb2
 
00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:02.580 align:start position:0%
thing as well that would have come
 
00:26:04.010 --> 00:26:04.020 align:start position:0%
through my division but I wasn't here at
 
00:26:07.010 --> 00:26:07.020 align:start position:0%
the time I think so uh certainly it's um
 
00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:08.580 align:start position:0%
that would be the most easiest way to do
 
00:26:10.190 --> 00:26:10.200 align:start position:0%
and we'll come back thank you any
 
00:26:13.549 --> 00:26:13.559 align:start position:0%
comments we are we all uh representative
 
00:26:15.049 --> 00:26:15.059 align:start position:0%
Bears hey bear
 
00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I want to thank
 
00:26:20.029 --> 00:26:20.039 align:start position:0%

00:26:30.049 --> 00:26:30.059 align:start position:0%
just outlining the concerns you just had
 
00:26:33.890 --> 00:26:33.900 align:start position:0%
pointing out the section in hb2 and then
 
00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:35.210 align:start position:0%
pointing out the section in hb2 and then
um

00:26:35.210 --> 00:26:35.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:37.380 align:start position:0%
you know taking this amendment which I
 
00:26:40.130 --> 00:26:40.140 align:start position:0%
assume you've looked at and and suggests
 
00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:41.880 align:start position:0%
some changes to it which we can look at
 
00:26:44.269 --> 00:26:44.279 align:start position:0%
we would be delighted to do that okay
 
00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:45.900 align:start position:0%
um is there anybody else who have any
 
00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:47.640 align:start position:0%
different issues with this who's here
 
00:26:49.250 --> 00:26:49.260 align:start position:0%
with uh
 
00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:51.710 align:start position:0%
with uh
207.

00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:51.720 align:start position:0%
207.
 
00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
all right see none I'm going to close
 
00:26:58.250 --> 00:26:58.260 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee work session on SB 207
 
00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:01.200 align:start position:0%
organized here a little bit
 
00:27:06.529 --> 00:27:06.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:08.450 --> 00:27:08.460 align:start position:0%
all right and then I'm going to open the
 
00:27:13.870 --> 00:27:13.880 align:start position:0%
subcommittee work session on SB 106.
 
00:27:18.409 --> 00:27:18.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:18.419 --> 00:27:21.830 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:23.340 align:start position:0%
I'll tell you what I was thinking then
 
00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:25.140 align:start position:0%
I'd like to you said you had more uh
 
00:27:27.409 --> 00:27:27.419 align:start position:0%
later information from representative
 
00:27:31.010 --> 00:27:31.020 align:start position:0%
okay so what was pointed out by
 
00:27:32.930 --> 00:27:32.940 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire
 
00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:34.490 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire
is

00:27:34.490 --> 00:27:34.500 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:35.149 align:start position:0%
is
um

00:27:35.149 --> 00:27:35.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:39.049 --> 00:27:39.059 align:start position:0%
in 170 e colon 50 which is part of the
 
00:27:41.049 --> 00:27:41.059 align:start position:0%
HHS statute
 
00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
which is um
 
00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:46.980 align:start position:0%
chapter 170e is child daycare
 
00:27:48.649 --> 00:27:48.659 align:start position:0%
residential care and child placement
 
00:27:50.090 --> 00:27:50.100 align:start position:0%
agencies and
 
00:27:52.490 --> 00:27:52.500 align:start position:0%
50 is credentialing a Personnel in early
 
00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:54.120 align:start position:0%
care and education programs I mean
 
00:27:56.570 --> 00:27:56.580 align:start position:0%
basically it's HHS that does the
 
00:27:58.909 --> 00:27:58.919 align:start position:0%
regulation of
 
00:28:02.930 --> 00:28:02.940 align:start position:0%
child care that appears and also I mean
 
00:28:04.669 --> 00:28:04.679 align:start position:0%
I can read this at Short
 
00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:07.260 align:start position:0%
but basically it gives
 
00:28:10.130 --> 00:28:10.140 align:start position:0%
HHS rulemaking Authority
 
00:28:12.529 --> 00:28:12.539 align:start position:0%
to do whatever
 
00:28:15.669 --> 00:28:15.679 align:start position:0%
um credentialing so
 
00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:19.260 align:start position:0%
HHS has as I read this and as chair
 
00:28:21.529 --> 00:28:21.539 align:start position:0%
McGuire reads this has the authority to
 
00:28:25.610 --> 00:28:25.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:28.010 --> 00:28:28.020 align:start position:0%
if you can turn the mic on sorry I know
 
00:28:29.029 --> 00:28:29.039 align:start position:0%
there's somebody here to speak on that
 
00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
and maybe if she could come up and and
 
00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:33.000 align:start position:0%
speak on it as well my understanding is
 
00:28:35.110 --> 00:28:35.120 align:start position:0%
is that there is some conflict between
 
00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:38.760 align:start position:0%
HHS and education that creates some
 
00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
confusion in some of this but I think
 
00:28:41.810 --> 00:28:41.820 align:start position:0%
she can give us better uh if there's
 
00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:43.200 align:start position:0%
somebody here who can speak to that or
 
00:28:44.810 --> 00:28:44.820 align:start position:0%
anybody here that can speak to who comes
 
00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:48.720 --> 00:29:00.289 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:29:00.289 --> 00:29:00.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:03.289 --> 00:29:03.299 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr chair and committee
 
00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:07.080 align:start position:0%
members uh my I am Jay Khan uh former
 
00:29:11.029 --> 00:29:11.039 align:start position:0%
state senator from Keene and uh someone
 
00:29:14.570 --> 00:29:14.580 align:start position:0%
who has worked with the Department of
 
00:29:16.269 --> 00:29:16.279 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services
 
00:29:19.810 --> 00:29:19.820 align:start position:0%
uh extensively on this issue
 
00:29:22.389 --> 00:29:22.399 align:start position:0%
so as I understand your question
 
00:29:26.510 --> 00:29:26.520 align:start position:0%
specifically right now it is uh
 
00:29:31.610 --> 00:29:31.620 align:start position:0%
uh related to uh wide
 
00:29:35.090 --> 00:29:35.100 align:start position:0%
not do this through rules versus doing
 
00:29:37.490 --> 00:29:37.500 align:start position:0%
this through statute correct because it
 
00:29:40.610 --> 00:29:40.620 align:start position:0%
looks like 170e colon 50 explicitly
 
00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:42.610 align:start position:0%
looks like 170e colon 50 explicitly
gives

00:29:42.610 --> 00:29:42.620 align:start position:0%
gives
 
00:29:45.409 --> 00:29:45.419 align:start position:0%
HHS rule making authority to do
 
00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:48.120 align:start position:0%
precisely what you're looking for
 
00:29:51.649 --> 00:29:51.659 align:start position:0%
and so I'll disagree with that okay uh
 
00:29:56.810 --> 00:29:56.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:00.889 --> 00:30:00.899 align:start position:0%
HHS has rule making Authority
 
00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:04.500 align:start position:0%
and they have developed a set of rules
 
00:30:07.789 --> 00:30:07.799 align:start position:0%
but they have not in that set of rules
 
00:30:07.799 --> 00:30:10.370 align:start position:0%
but they have not in that set of rules
recognized

00:30:10.370 --> 00:30:10.380 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
00:30:13.330 --> 00:30:13.340 align:start position:0%
the department of education's
 
00:30:16.990 --> 00:30:17.000 align:start position:0%
Career Technical education programs
 
00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.730 align:start position:0%
Career Technical education programs
as

00:30:18.730 --> 00:30:18.740 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:30:22.730 --> 00:30:22.740 align:start position:0%
training for the Early Childhood
 
00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:24.409 align:start position:0%
training for the Early Childhood
credentialing

00:30:24.409 --> 00:30:24.419 align:start position:0%
credentialing
 
00:30:29.269 --> 00:30:29.279 align:start position:0%
and that is what this is trying to do a
 
00:30:32.450 --> 00:30:32.460 align:start position:0%
common thing that exists Across the
 
00:30:36.049 --> 00:30:36.059 align:start position:0%
Nation is that for Early Childhood
 
00:30:38.930 --> 00:30:38.940 align:start position:0%
there's dual jurisdiction
 
00:30:42.169 --> 00:30:42.179 align:start position:0%
by Health and Human Services departments
 
00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:44.760 align:start position:0%
and Departments of Education
 
00:30:48.289 --> 00:30:48.299 align:start position:0%
and it gets to be complicated
 
00:30:50.029 --> 00:30:50.039 align:start position:0%
uh to
 
00:30:50.039 --> 00:30:51.590 align:start position:0%
uh to
credential

00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
credential
 
00:30:54.430 --> 00:30:54.440 align:start position:0%
early educators
 
00:30:58.549 --> 00:30:58.559 align:start position:0%
and this is trying to transcend that and
 
00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
and get Beyond it by assuring that the
 
00:31:06.830 --> 00:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
students who go through training in our
 
00:31:08.810 --> 00:31:08.820 align:start position:0%
high school Career Technical education
 
00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:10.250 align:start position:0%
high school Career Technical education
programs

00:31:10.250 --> 00:31:10.260 align:start position:0%
programs
 
00:31:13.490 --> 00:31:13.500 align:start position:0%
leave those programs within industry
 
00:31:16.370 --> 00:31:16.380 align:start position:0%
recognized credential that the
 
00:31:17.830 --> 00:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:31:20.049 --> 00:31:20.059 align:start position:0%
hasn't touched
 
00:31:23.330 --> 00:31:23.340 align:start position:0%
so this is and and this has the support
 
00:31:27.049 --> 00:31:27.059 align:start position:0%
of of the department and their Bureau of
 
00:31:30.769 --> 00:31:30.779 align:start position:0%
credentialing with Department which the
 
00:31:33.169 --> 00:31:33.179 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services I mean has
 
00:31:34.970 --> 00:31:34.980 align:start position:0%
anyone approached them
 
00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
about doing this through rulemaking and
 
00:31:39.169 --> 00:31:39.179 align:start position:0%
is there some legal technical issue why
 
00:31:41.169 --> 00:31:41.179 align:start position:0%
they can't do it
 
00:31:43.669 --> 00:31:43.679 align:start position:0%
because it's not clear to me there is I
 
00:31:46.250 --> 00:31:46.260 align:start position:0%
mean I don't see anything in the stature
 
00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
that would prevent them from recognizing
 
00:31:52.190 --> 00:31:52.200 align:start position:0%
graduation from such a CTE program to
 
00:31:57.230 --> 00:31:57.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:03.049 --> 00:32:03.059 align:start position:0%
um well this is a a specific
 
00:32:06.529 --> 00:32:06.539 align:start position:0%
charge obviously and we know we know law
 
00:32:11.049 --> 00:32:11.059 align:start position:0%
Trump's rules right we we know that laws
 
00:32:14.710 --> 00:32:14.720 align:start position:0%
Trump rules sure uh
 
00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:19.200 align:start position:0%
this make sure that uh
 
00:32:23.029 --> 00:32:23.039 align:start position:0%
the intent of the legislature to make
 
00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
sure that both the Department of
 
00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:28.440 align:start position:0%
Education and HHS will
 
00:32:32.389 --> 00:32:32.399 align:start position:0%
have a program that leads to a
 
00:32:32.399 --> 00:32:34.510 align:start position:0%
have a program that leads to a
credential

00:32:34.510 --> 00:32:34.520 align:start position:0%
credential
 
00:32:37.549 --> 00:32:37.559 align:start position:0%
for entry into early childhood education
 
00:32:39.529 --> 00:32:39.539 align:start position:0%
sure I have a question we I thought we
 
00:32:41.330 --> 00:32:41.340 align:start position:0%
heard that
 
00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
um doe and the CT program had this
 
00:32:47.029 --> 00:32:47.039 align:start position:0%
educational program I mean they can't
 
00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:48.720 align:start position:0%
Grant the credential
 
00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:50.029 align:start position:0%
Grant the credential
but

00:32:50.029 --> 00:32:50.039 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:32:52.250 --> 00:32:52.260 align:start position:0%
um that they have the education program
 
00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:54.360 align:start position:0%
in place
 
00:32:57.669 --> 00:32:57.679 align:start position:0%
is that not correct correct
 
00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
they do okay thank you
 
00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
so it you know we don't need to get them
 
00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:05.460 align:start position:0%
it sounds like to do anything different
 
00:33:07.610 --> 00:33:07.620 align:start position:0%
it's just a question of
 
00:33:09.289 --> 00:33:09.299 align:start position:0%
well I guess my other question is has
 
00:33:10.750 --> 00:33:10.760 align:start position:0%
anybody actually
 
00:33:13.789 --> 00:33:13.799 align:start position:0%
approached HHS about
 
00:33:16.549 --> 00:33:16.559 align:start position:0%
creating such a credential what was the
 
00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
response uh that this is a good way to
 
00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
go about it
 
00:33:23.509 --> 00:33:23.519 align:start position:0%
they were here for the hearing and
 
00:33:26.269 --> 00:33:26.279 align:start position:0%
supported this effort
 
00:33:29.330 --> 00:33:29.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:31.669 --> 00:33:31.679 align:start position:0%
they've been very Cooperative in
 
00:33:34.730 --> 00:33:34.740 align:start position:0%
developing this language I just don't
 
00:33:37.970 --> 00:33:37.980 align:start position:0%
understand why if the legislature has
 
00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
already given the authority to do this
 
00:33:41.149 --> 00:33:41.159 align:start position:0%
they want to have
 
00:33:44.029 --> 00:33:44.039 align:start position:0%
more stuff in statute to confirm that
 
00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
and that's not something I would
 
00:33:47.210 --> 00:33:47.220 align:start position:0%
normally want to do
 
00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:49.200 align:start position:0%
so I I think you know the basic question
 
00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
is is there anything really preventing
 
00:33:54.769 --> 00:33:54.779 align:start position:0%
them from doing it today
 
00:33:57.710 --> 00:33:57.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:01.440 align:start position:0%
one needs to wonder if they was if this
 
00:34:03.950 --> 00:34:03.960 align:start position:0%
was their intent why has this not been
 
00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:04.789 align:start position:0%
was their intent why has this not been
done

00:34:04.789 --> 00:34:04.799 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
they just recently went through rule
 
00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:08.510 align:start position:0%
they just recently went through rule
making

00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
making
 
00:34:11.930 --> 00:34:11.940 align:start position:0%
and ignored this route
 
00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:14.210 align:start position:0%
and ignored this route
uh

00:34:14.210 --> 00:34:14.220 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
it has not been done uh you you have a
 
00:34:20.629 --> 00:34:20.639 align:start position:0%
table in front of you I remember was was
 
00:34:23.450 --> 00:34:23.460 align:start position:0%
and I'd be I brought extra copies of it
 
00:34:26.869 --> 00:34:26.879 align:start position:0%
of the various credentials that the
 
00:34:30.770 --> 00:34:30.780 align:start position:0%
department has uh gone through rule
 
00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
making to establish uh there is an
 
00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:37.560 align:start position:0%
emerging professional certificate
 
00:34:40.329 --> 00:34:40.339 align:start position:0%
it does not recognize
 
00:34:45.109 --> 00:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
the completion of a CTE program okay is
 
00:34:47.869 --> 00:34:47.879 align:start position:0%
there anyone here from HHS who can speak
 
00:34:49.250 --> 00:34:49.260 align:start position:0%
to this no
 
00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:58.070 --> 00:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:34:59.570 --> 00:34:59.580 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:00.770 align:start position:0%
all right
um

00:35:00.770 --> 00:35:00.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:03.589 --> 00:35:03.599 align:start position:0%
I mean if they expressed any up I mean
 
00:35:05.690 --> 00:35:05.700 align:start position:0%
it seems strange to me that they're
 
00:35:07.790 --> 00:35:07.800 align:start position:0%
saying they'd like this length in just a
 
00:35:09.890 --> 00:35:09.900 align:start position:0%
moment oh sorry uh you have a question
 
00:35:19.210 --> 00:35:19.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:24.170 --> 00:35:24.180 align:start position:0%
is the rub between two agencies
 
00:35:24.180 --> 00:35:24.770 align:start position:0%
is the rub between two agencies
um

00:35:24.770 --> 00:35:24.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:28.630 --> 00:35:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
Jackie might be a better person I mean I
 
00:35:33.470 --> 00:35:33.480 align:start position:0%
certainly want to hear what you have to
 
00:35:36.290 --> 00:35:36.300 align:start position:0%
say but also there's a statute that
 
00:35:39.170 --> 00:35:39.180 align:start position:0%
explicitly gives HHS The Authority I
 
00:35:41.390 --> 00:35:41.400 align:start position:0%
don't know if you can how do you do I'm
 
00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:43.260 align:start position:0%
I'm Jackie Cowell from Early Learning
 
00:35:44.569 --> 00:35:44.579 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we're a Statewide
 
00:35:46.849 --> 00:35:46.859 align:start position:0%
non-profit we Advocate on behalf of
 
00:35:48.770 --> 00:35:48.780 align:start position:0%
child care programs and professionals
 
00:35:51.490 --> 00:35:51.500 align:start position:0%
and so we do support this bill because
 
00:35:55.370 --> 00:35:55.380 align:start position:0%
yes it is true perhaps that that HHS
 
00:35:57.170 --> 00:35:57.180 align:start position:0%
could do it they haven't done it for
 
00:35:59.450 --> 00:35:59.460 align:start position:0%
years CTE has been around for a long
 
00:36:02.089 --> 00:36:02.099 align:start position:0%
time we do think this will strengthen
 
00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
that and we have to do everything we can
 
00:36:06.349 --> 00:36:06.359 align:start position:0%
right now to bring Child Care
 
00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
Professionals into the field and we
 
00:36:09.950 --> 00:36:09.960 align:start position:0%
think this will strengthen it by having
 
00:36:12.109 --> 00:36:12.119 align:start position:0%
this law but also
 
00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
um I think uh Senator former Senator
 
00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
Khan had mentioned previously if you do
 
00:36:19.370 --> 00:36:19.380 align:start position:0%
have this credential if it is called
 
00:36:22.130 --> 00:36:22.140 align:start position:0%
this emerging credential many places
 
00:36:24.170 --> 00:36:24.180 align:start position:0%
will hire these high school students
 
00:36:26.089 --> 00:36:26.099 align:start position:0%
right out of this program at higher
 
00:36:28.609 --> 00:36:28.619 align:start position:0%
salaries with this very particular
 
00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:31.800 align:start position:0%
credential and I do think it's it's a
 
00:36:33.770 --> 00:36:33.780 align:start position:0%
statement the legislature would be great
 
00:36:35.870 --> 00:36:35.880 align:start position:0%
to make even though yes could have been
 
00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
done perhaps it hasn't been done ever
 
00:36:39.170 --> 00:36:39.180 align:start position:0%
and it could have been done three years
 
00:36:41.450 --> 00:36:41.460 align:start position:0%
anybody talked with HHS about this have
 
00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
they had some reason some objection to
 
00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:45.230 align:start position:0%
they had some reason some objection to
it

00:36:45.230 --> 00:36:45.240 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
no uh there is none and Deb Nelson uh
 
00:36:52.069 --> 00:36:52.079 align:start position:0%
leads the child care credentialing
 
00:36:52.079 --> 00:36:54.290 align:start position:0%
leads the child care credentialing
Bureau

00:36:54.290 --> 00:36:54.300 align:start position:0%
Bureau
 
00:36:59.950 --> 00:36:59.960 align:start position:0%
in HHS she is out on an extended uh
 
00:37:03.410 --> 00:37:03.420 align:start position:0%
Family Leave medical issue
 
00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:04.550 align:start position:0%
Family Leave medical issue
um

00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
I regret that because obviously but she
 
00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
has been a partner in this she rewrote
 
00:37:14.390 --> 00:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
this for the Senate that's what the
 
00:37:17.210 --> 00:37:17.220 align:start position:0%
nature of the Senate amendment is
 
00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:18.349 align:start position:0%
nature of the Senate amendment is
um

00:37:18.349 --> 00:37:18.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:21.720 align:start position:0%
she recognizes the Gap and and the
 
00:37:26.290 --> 00:37:26.300 align:start position:0%
effort to to fill the Gap with a
 
00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:28.200 align:start position:0%
High School
 
00:37:31.490 --> 00:37:31.500 align:start position:0%
program eventually
 
00:37:34.849 --> 00:37:34.859 align:start position:0%
um is there someone else who
 
00:37:36.829 --> 00:37:36.839 align:start position:0%
you know in the department who could
 
00:37:38.810 --> 00:37:38.820 align:start position:0%
speak to this other than her if she's
 
00:37:41.290 --> 00:37:41.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:44.230 --> 00:37:44.240 align:start position:0%
here for the hearing
 
00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:46.329 align:start position:0%
here for the hearing
and

00:37:46.329 --> 00:37:46.339 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:37:49.910 --> 00:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
he was in support
 
00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
well I'm not asking that my question is
 
00:37:55.250 --> 00:37:55.260 align:start position:0%
they have the authority to do it why
 
00:37:56.930 --> 00:37:56.940 align:start position:0%
have they chosen not to do it that's
 
00:38:00.109 --> 00:38:00.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
um and do they have an email and
 
00:38:03.890 --> 00:38:03.900 align:start position:0%
is there some reason they're reluctant
 
00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
to do it or they have some opposition to
 
00:38:09.589 --> 00:38:09.599 align:start position:0%
it which you say they don't if so why
 
00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
didn't they do it through rules this
 
00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:13.560 align:start position:0%
isn't making a lot of sense basically so
 
00:38:16.190 --> 00:38:16.200 align:start position:0%
do you yeah I I can give you some names
 
00:38:17.930 --> 00:38:17.940 align:start position:0%
of those folks who could answer that
 
00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:20.640 align:start position:0%
question for you sure my guess oh so
 
00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:26.750 --> 00:38:26.760 align:start position:0%
dot r
 
00:38:29.890 --> 00:38:29.900 align:start position:0%
as in Roger dot Chase
 
00:38:32.329 --> 00:38:32.339 align:start position:0%
c-h-a-s-e she's the second in command to
 
00:38:35.270 --> 00:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
Deborah Nelson and that's at uh at
 
00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:37.150 align:start position:0%
Deborah Nelson and that's at uh at
Legend

00:38:37.150 --> 00:38:37.160 align:start position:0%
Legend
 
00:38:44.270 --> 00:38:44.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:45.410 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:38:45.410 --> 00:38:45.420 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:38:48.589 --> 00:38:48.599 align:start position:0%
again what has been historic because
 
00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:51.480 align:start position:0%
this does to you know connect the
 
00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
Department of Education my guess is it's
 
00:38:56.089 --> 00:38:56.099 align:start position:0%
never been done never been talked about
 
00:38:58.970 --> 00:38:58.980 align:start position:0%
because of those two dual roles
 
00:39:00.170 --> 00:39:00.180 align:start position:0%
um that they you know that they they
 
00:39:02.450 --> 00:39:02.460 align:start position:0%
didn't do a rulemaking for
 
00:39:04.490 --> 00:39:04.500 align:start position:0%
something with Department of Ed but the
 
00:39:06.470 --> 00:39:06.480 align:start position:0%
fact that they have been very supportive
 
00:39:09.109 --> 00:39:09.119 align:start position:0%
of this and feeling again like if the
 
00:39:11.150 --> 00:39:11.160 align:start position:0%
legislature says well how important this
 
00:39:13.550 --> 00:39:13.560 align:start position:0%
is will help right I mean
 
00:39:15.770 --> 00:39:15.780 align:start position:0%
you know the Department of Veteran has
 
00:39:17.930 --> 00:39:17.940 align:start position:0%
the program I don't see why they even
 
00:39:20.030 --> 00:39:20.040 align:start position:0%
need to be involved
 
00:39:21.829 --> 00:39:21.839 align:start position:0%
um so having to coordinate it doesn't
 
00:39:23.569 --> 00:39:23.579 align:start position:0%
maybe there's something I'm missing and
 
00:39:25.990 --> 00:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
and you know if there's some information
 
00:39:28.370 --> 00:39:28.380 align:start position:0%
provided that makes it clear why they
 
00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:30.720 align:start position:0%
cannot do it
 
00:39:33.109 --> 00:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
um now then you know I might look at
 
00:39:34.849 --> 00:39:34.859 align:start position:0%
this differently but any anybody else in
 
00:39:37.089 --> 00:39:37.099 align:start position:0%
the committee have questions for them or
 
00:39:39.890 --> 00:39:39.900 align:start position:0%
comments yeah yeah you know from my
 
00:39:41.390 --> 00:39:41.400 align:start position:0%
understanding is this is something this
 
00:39:43.370 --> 00:39:43.380 align:start position:0%
is not something new this is something
 
00:39:45.050 --> 00:39:45.060 align:start position:0%
that I guess it was a long-term study
 
00:39:47.930 --> 00:39:47.940 align:start position:0%
that went on and this is one of the core
 
00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
recommendations that came out of it to
 
00:39:51.650 --> 00:39:51.660 align:start position:0%
utilize this program uh Department of
 
00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:53.640 align:start position:0%
Education so it's been in front of DHHS
 
00:39:56.630 --> 00:39:56.640 align:start position:0%
for more than a couple years and they
 
00:39:58.670 --> 00:39:58.680 align:start position:0%
haven't taken any action on it and I
 
00:40:02.030 --> 00:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
think we're probably all in in wondering
 
00:40:04.370 --> 00:40:04.380 align:start position:0%
why they have it as well but just
 
00:40:06.290 --> 00:40:06.300 align:start position:0%
assuming that there is some sort of line
 
00:40:08.329 --> 00:40:08.339 align:start position:0%
between the two that neither department
 
00:40:11.870 --> 00:40:11.880 align:start position:0%
wants to cross and that they're here to
 
00:40:14.089 --> 00:40:14.099 align:start position:0%
you know we're here to basically require
 
00:40:16.190 --> 00:40:16.200 align:start position:0%
that they cross that line by putting it
 
00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:18.240 align:start position:0%
into statute so I understand the
 
00:40:19.849 --> 00:40:19.859 align:start position:0%
reluctance of putting a new statute this
 
00:40:21.589 --> 00:40:21.599 align:start position:0%
is maybe one place where we have to than
 
00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
anyone else here just hang on this
 
00:40:28.370 --> 00:40:28.380 align:start position:0%
yep representative bear
 
00:40:31.370 --> 00:40:31.380 align:start position:0%
hey there thank you Mr chairman
 
00:40:35.329 --> 00:40:35.339 align:start position:0%
personally I I like the bill I I like
 
00:40:38.930 --> 00:40:38.940 align:start position:0%
the idea of bringing more
 
00:40:41.329 --> 00:40:41.339 align:start position:0%
um willing students that want to get a
 
00:40:44.510 --> 00:40:44.520 align:start position:0%
certification into the workforce and
 
00:40:46.730 --> 00:40:46.740 align:start position:0%
um in getting that certification and the
 
00:40:50.030 --> 00:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
fact that we haven't had a real weigh-in
 
00:40:54.890 --> 00:40:54.900 align:start position:0%
on why HHS has not done it leads me to
 
00:40:57.290 --> 00:40:57.300 align:start position:0%
believe that maybe in the middle of
 
00:40:59.450 --> 00:40:59.460 align:start position:0%
covid over the last three or four years
 
00:41:01.910 --> 00:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
that everything has fallen to a low
 
00:41:03.650 --> 00:41:03.660 align:start position:0%
priority and
 
00:41:06.890 --> 00:41:06.900 align:start position:0%
I like it I'm in support okay
 
00:41:12.230 --> 00:41:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:15.410 --> 00:41:15.420 align:start position:0%
well I mean but education doesn't offer
 
00:41:16.609 --> 00:41:16.619 align:start position:0%
certification they don't have the
 
00:41:19.370 --> 00:41:19.380 align:start position:0%
authority it could be given but
 
00:41:19.380 --> 00:41:21.170 align:start position:0%
authority it could be given but
yeah

00:41:21.170 --> 00:41:21.180 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:22.609 align:start position:0%
yeah
um

00:41:22.609 --> 00:41:22.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:22.619 --> 00:41:24.109 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:41:24.109 --> 00:41:24.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:41:27.470 --> 00:41:27.480 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman of my mind something that
 
00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
might address your concern
 
00:41:32.210 --> 00:41:32.220 align:start position:0%
um if you'd go to page two of this bill
 
00:41:34.849 --> 00:41:34.859 align:start position:0%
and line one
 
00:41:34.859 --> 00:41:37.430 align:start position:0%
and line one
uh

00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:41:42.430 --> 00:41:42.440 align:start position:0%
and note the kinds of uh
 
00:41:46.430 --> 00:41:46.440 align:start position:0%
sites that can be used for the clinical
 
00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:47.990 align:start position:0%
sites that can be used for the clinical
hours

00:41:47.990 --> 00:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
hours
 
00:41:50.890 --> 00:41:50.900 align:start position:0%
you'll notice that it it it
 
00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
covers uh licensed Center
 
00:41:58.250 --> 00:41:58.260 align:start position:0%
licensed center-based Child Care
 
00:42:01.430 --> 00:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
programs licensed family child care
 
00:42:04.130 --> 00:42:04.140 align:start position:0%
programs or public
 
00:42:07.970 --> 00:42:07.980 align:start position:0%
or a private School pre-k through third
 
00:42:10.430 --> 00:42:10.440 align:start position:0%
grade programs
 
00:42:13.130 --> 00:42:13.140 align:start position:0%
the public and private School pre-k
 
00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
programs are not licensed through HHS
 
00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
that's one of the barriers that there is
 
00:42:24.170 --> 00:42:24.180 align:start position:0%
in this cross agency issue
 
00:42:27.770 --> 00:42:27.780 align:start position:0%
this statute says no you will recognize
 
00:42:31.730 --> 00:42:31.740 align:start position:0%
those Child Care programs in the
 
00:42:34.250 --> 00:42:34.260 align:start position:0%
school that are School based
 
00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:35.870 align:start position:0%
school that are School based
and

00:42:35.870 --> 00:42:35.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:42:39.170 --> 00:42:39.180 align:start position:0%
those hours then will count towards the
 
00:42:42.349 --> 00:42:42.359 align:start position:0%
certification okay and that's that's a
 
00:42:42.359 --> 00:42:43.670 align:start position:0%
certification okay and that's that's a
specific

00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
specific
 
00:42:47.870 --> 00:42:47.880 align:start position:0%
change that enables the certification to
 
00:42:52.490 --> 00:42:52.500 align:start position:0%
be comparable in this bill to the rules
 
00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:54.250 align:start position:0%
be comparable in this bill to the rules
that

00:42:54.250 --> 00:42:54.260 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:42:56.990 --> 00:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
what I would refer to the committee what
 
00:42:58.430 --> 00:42:58.440 align:start position:0%
I'd like to suggest we have to get
 
00:43:01.550 --> 00:43:01.560 align:start position:0%
together again anyway for 207 what I'd
 
00:43:02.809 --> 00:43:02.819 align:start position:0%
like to do
 
00:43:04.490 --> 00:43:04.500 align:start position:0%
there's not a real strong objection
 
00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:06.240 align:start position:0%
would be to
 
00:43:09.770 --> 00:43:09.780 align:start position:0%
try and get a hold of Diane Chase and
 
00:43:12.530 --> 00:43:12.540 align:start position:0%
ask explicitly
 
00:43:14.450 --> 00:43:14.460 align:start position:0%
you know why they haven't done it and
 
00:43:17.150 --> 00:43:17.160 align:start position:0%
maybe it is this issue and that really
 
00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
is a legal technical issue in which case
 
00:43:22.130 --> 00:43:22.140 align:start position:0%
I'd probably be okay with this
 
00:43:25.309 --> 00:43:25.319 align:start position:0%
um if they have
 
00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
I mean I just want a clear answer from
 
00:43:29.630 --> 00:43:29.640 align:start position:0%
HHS as to why they haven't done this and
 
00:43:31.250 --> 00:43:31.260 align:start position:0%
and maybe maybe it could be they haven't
 
00:43:33.470 --> 00:43:33.480 align:start position:0%
gotten around to it and now they could
 
00:43:36.170 --> 00:43:36.180 align:start position:0%
uh maybe there is you know this does
 
00:43:39.589 --> 00:43:39.599 align:start position:0%
because the presume of the CTE program
 
00:43:41.630 --> 00:43:41.640 align:start position:0%
allows the clinical to occur in those
 
00:43:44.990 --> 00:43:45.000 align:start position:0%
places then maybe they can't accept the
 
00:43:47.450 --> 00:43:47.460 align:start position:0%
CT certificate that could very well be
 
00:43:49.609 --> 00:43:49.619 align:start position:0%
it and and I would understand that so
 
00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
yeah sure uh Mr chairman I from my
 
00:43:55.370 --> 00:43:55.380 align:start position:0%
understanding is that this program will
 
00:43:57.650 --> 00:43:57.660 align:start position:0%
also this will also help people who may
 
00:43:59.450 --> 00:43:59.460 align:start position:0%
have and I'm looking at adults more than
 
00:44:02.270 --> 00:44:02.280 align:start position:0%
kids who may have taken courses in high
 
00:44:04.370 --> 00:44:04.380 align:start position:0%
school but not gotten into the field and
 
00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
not been able to complete their style
 
00:44:08.210 --> 00:44:08.220 align:start position:0%
their requirements and not having to go
 
00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
back to a a community college system but
 
00:44:13.609 --> 00:44:13.619 align:start position:0%
being able to use experience where they
 
00:44:15.109 --> 00:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
may have had years of experience to get
 
00:44:17.030 --> 00:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
credentialed but they do not have the
 
00:44:18.829 --> 00:44:18.839 align:start position:0%
college requirements to get credentialed
 
00:44:21.710 --> 00:44:21.720 align:start position:0%
this would allow them to be credentialed
 
00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:23.880 align:start position:0%
based on their experience and their and
 
00:44:25.250 --> 00:44:25.260 align:start position:0%
working in the field we're in the
 
00:44:27.470 --> 00:44:27.480 align:start position:0%
statute does it say that
 
00:44:29.569 --> 00:44:29.579 align:start position:0%
well no it's just that people who may
 
00:44:31.730 --> 00:44:31.740 align:start position:0%
not want to go back to school to get
 
00:44:33.710 --> 00:44:33.720 align:start position:0%
those things this would give them the
 
00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
ability how would this bill do that by
 
00:44:38.930 --> 00:44:38.940 align:start position:0%
allowing them to have uh experience in
 
00:44:40.670 --> 00:44:40.680 align:start position:0%
these different types of facilities such
 
00:44:42.589 --> 00:44:42.599 align:start position:0%
as a Child Care Program a licensed
 
00:44:43.730 --> 00:44:43.740 align:start position:0%
family program
 
00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:47.390 align:start position:0%
family program
um

00:44:47.390 --> 00:44:47.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
right now without going yeah but I think
 
00:44:50.990 --> 00:44:51.000 align:start position:0%
I think I think that's I think that's
 
00:44:52.490 --> 00:44:52.500 align:start position:0%
under that would have to be under the
 
00:44:55.569 --> 00:44:55.579 align:start position:0%
CTE program I don't think this bill
 
00:44:57.890 --> 00:44:57.900 align:start position:0%
addresses at all the issue of just
 
00:44:59.510 --> 00:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
general experience well this is maybe
 
00:45:01.069 --> 00:45:01.079 align:start position:0%
somebody who went through a CTE program
 
00:45:02.450 --> 00:45:02.460 align:start position:0%
at one point but did not get
 
00:45:04.609 --> 00:45:04.619 align:start position:0%
credentialed and did not have the
 
00:45:06.290 --> 00:45:06.300 align:start position:0%
additional training that under current
 
00:45:07.849 --> 00:45:07.859 align:start position:0%
system you have to get some additional
 
00:45:10.010 --> 00:45:10.020 align:start position:0%
college credits in order to get in in
 
00:45:12.230 --> 00:45:12.240 align:start position:0%
order to become certified this would
 
00:45:13.849 --> 00:45:13.859 align:start position:0%
allow them to utilize experience yeah
 
00:45:15.349 --> 00:45:15.359 align:start position:0%
I'm skeptical that this will work
 
00:45:17.450 --> 00:45:17.460 align:start position:0%
because it says they they have to have
 
00:45:19.670 --> 00:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
500 hours in a Career and Technical
 
00:45:21.230 --> 00:45:21.240 align:start position:0%
education teacher education program
 
00:45:23.210 --> 00:45:23.220 align:start position:0%
includes minimum 250 hours of
 
00:45:25.670 --> 00:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
observation all this other stuff and so
 
00:45:28.370 --> 00:45:28.380 align:start position:0%
they've got us according to this they
 
00:45:30.829 --> 00:45:30.839 align:start position:0%
have to have this experience within as
 
00:45:32.450 --> 00:45:32.460 align:start position:0%
part of a CTE program I don't think
 
00:45:34.370 --> 00:45:34.380 align:start position:0%
it'll do that at all I mean that might
 
00:45:35.930 --> 00:45:35.940 align:start position:0%
be a good thing to do
 
00:45:38.210 --> 00:45:38.220 align:start position:0%
on like you know you know a later bill
 
00:45:40.910 --> 00:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
but I don't think this will do it
 
00:45:42.470 --> 00:45:42.480 align:start position:0%
but at least the way I read this
 
00:45:45.050 --> 00:45:45.060 align:start position:0%
SnapChat Michael advice has been again
 
00:45:46.670 --> 00:45:46.680 align:start position:0%
has been different from that that's all
 
00:45:48.770 --> 00:45:48.780 align:start position:0%
from experiment people who my wife is in
 
00:45:50.750 --> 00:45:50.760 align:start position:0%
the situation and hires these people and
 
00:45:52.069 --> 00:45:52.079 align:start position:0%
looks at being able to get some people
 
00:45:53.510 --> 00:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
credentialed that are unable to be
 
00:45:55.670 --> 00:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
credentialed at the current time
 
00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:57.890 align:start position:0%
credentialed at the current time
um

00:45:57.890 --> 00:45:57.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:59.270 --> 00:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
yeah actually I might want to talk with
 
00:46:01.130 --> 00:46:01.140 align:start position:0%
her about that but in fact I'm
 
00:46:02.569 --> 00:46:02.579 align:start position:0%
representative a bear
 
00:46:05.150 --> 00:46:05.160 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chairman I had a question off of
 
00:46:09.230 --> 00:46:09.240 align:start position:0%
Representative grassi's comments would a
 
00:46:12.770 --> 00:46:12.780 align:start position:0%
high school you know how you can take
 
00:46:16.390 --> 00:46:16.400 align:start position:0%
um night courses at a high school or
 
00:46:21.470 --> 00:46:21.480 align:start position:0%
extracurricular is that what that means
 
00:46:24.109 --> 00:46:24.119 align:start position:0%
well as I read this it would have to be
 
00:46:26.809 --> 00:46:26.819 align:start position:0%
within a CT program and I don't know if
 
00:46:29.150 --> 00:46:29.160 align:start position:0%
the CT programs offer night classes to
 
00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:30.170 align:start position:0%
the CT programs offer night classes to
adults

00:46:30.170 --> 00:46:30.180 align:start position:0%
adults
 
00:46:32.630 --> 00:46:32.640 align:start position:0%
but I suppose if they did offer that
 
00:46:35.089 --> 00:46:35.099 align:start position:0%
program that form yeah it could work but
 
00:46:37.370 --> 00:46:37.380 align:start position:0%
again I mean there's nothing that would
 
00:46:39.410 --> 00:46:39.420 align:start position:0%
prevent HHS from accepting rulemaking
 
00:46:41.870 --> 00:46:41.880 align:start position:0%
and I really like to understand why they
 
00:46:44.030 --> 00:46:44.040 align:start position:0%
haven't done it I mean if maybe
 
00:46:45.950 --> 00:46:45.960 align:start position:0%
technical stuff that they feel that
 
00:46:48.589 --> 00:46:48.599 align:start position:0%
there's a legal potential issue and
 
00:46:50.630 --> 00:46:50.640 align:start position:0%
that's legit
 
00:46:52.370 --> 00:46:52.380 align:start position:0%
um and then or there may be some other
 
00:46:52.380 --> 00:46:53.510 align:start position:0%
um and then or there may be some other
reason

00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
reason
 
00:46:57.410 --> 00:46:57.420 align:start position:0%
I I I do want to reiterate the answer is
 
00:47:01.250 --> 00:47:01.260 align:start position:0%
and and you can call Diane Chase but the
 
00:47:04.670 --> 00:47:04.680 align:start position:0%
answer is that the high school-based CTE
 
00:47:07.609 --> 00:47:07.619 align:start position:0%
programs are generally almost
 
00:47:10.069 --> 00:47:10.079 align:start position:0%
exclusively but I think there's maybe
 
00:47:12.050 --> 00:47:12.060 align:start position:0%
one or two instances where the CTE
 
00:47:14.030 --> 00:47:14.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a child care center but
 
00:47:16.730 --> 00:47:16.740 align:start position:0%
offers a certificate program so they
 
00:47:19.370 --> 00:47:19.380 align:start position:0%
have to go out placement to an HHS
 
00:47:21.290 --> 00:47:21.300 align:start position:0%
licensed facility
 
00:47:25.150 --> 00:47:25.160 align:start position:0%
this allows for a not
 
00:47:28.790 --> 00:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
non-hs licensed facility that a program
 
00:47:31.910 --> 00:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
that is licensed or permitted through
 
00:47:34.849 --> 00:47:34.859 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education
 
00:47:37.190 --> 00:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
to be able to offer those clinical hours
 
00:47:40.910 --> 00:47:40.920 align:start position:0%
that's what this does and and when the
 
00:47:42.470 --> 00:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
student goes through these programs and
 
00:47:45.109 --> 00:47:45.119 align:start position:0%
I I provided that to you earlier too I'd
 
00:47:47.150 --> 00:47:47.160 align:start position:0%
be glad to provide that what the program
 
00:47:50.690 --> 00:47:50.700 align:start position:0%
has it has these programs have these
 
00:47:52.069 --> 00:47:52.079 align:start position:0%
requirements they meet these
 
00:47:55.190 --> 00:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
requirements and they can deliver people
 
00:47:59.270 --> 00:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
into the field with both education and
 
00:48:01.730 --> 00:48:01.740 align:start position:0%
clinical hour experience through the
 
00:48:03.230 --> 00:48:03.240 align:start position:0%
school-based program
 
00:48:05.450 --> 00:48:05.460 align:start position:0%
and and the department
 
00:48:07.670 --> 00:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
can't do that right now okay because
 
00:48:09.530 --> 00:48:09.540 align:start position:0%
they don't recognize and don't license
 
00:48:12.890 --> 00:48:12.900 align:start position:0%
the school basis I mean that's that may
 
00:48:14.750 --> 00:48:14.760 align:start position:0%
very well be the issue in which case I
 
00:48:16.190 --> 00:48:16.200 align:start position:0%
could support this but I would feel more
 
00:48:19.550 --> 00:48:19.560 align:start position:0%
comfortable if I talk to uh Diane Chase
 
00:48:21.109 --> 00:48:21.119 align:start position:0%
talked it over
 
00:48:23.990 --> 00:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
and you know I mean somebody can make a
 
00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
motion we could do whatever here but
 
00:48:28.910 --> 00:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
um you know if that's what's going on
 
00:48:31.430 --> 00:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
then I'd likely support the bill and I
 
00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:32.150 align:start position:0%
then I'd likely support the bill and I
think

00:48:32.150 --> 00:48:32.160 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:48:34.430 --> 00:48:34.440 align:start position:0%
um some other members of the committee
 
00:48:36.050 --> 00:48:36.060 align:start position:0%
would would be much more likely to
 
00:48:37.309 --> 00:48:37.319 align:start position:0%
support the bill
 
00:48:41.390 --> 00:48:41.400 align:start position:0%
if that were clearly answered by HHS
 
00:48:43.130 --> 00:48:43.140 align:start position:0%
so unless there's and we have to come
 
00:48:44.809 --> 00:48:44.819 align:start position:0%
back anyway so unless there's an
 
00:48:44.819 --> 00:48:46.130 align:start position:0%
back anyway so unless there's an
objection

00:48:46.130 --> 00:48:46.140 align:start position:0%
objection
 
00:48:48.230 --> 00:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
I'd like to do the same thing as the
 
00:48:49.430 --> 00:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
other bill is to get some more
 
00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:50.750 align:start position:0%
other bill is to get some more
information

00:48:50.750 --> 00:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:48:52.910 --> 00:48:52.920 align:start position:0%
and take it up again
 
00:48:55.370 --> 00:48:55.380 align:start position:0%
respect for the chair out of respects
 
00:48:57.530 --> 00:48:57.540 align:start position:0%
the chair I will not object to that so
 
00:49:00.050 --> 00:49:00.060 align:start position:0%
but okay thank you
 
00:49:01.849 --> 00:49:01.859 align:start position:0%
um maybe I'm nitpicky want to be
 
00:49:03.710 --> 00:49:03.720 align:start position:0%
comfortable with it maybe more and and
 
00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:05.150 align:start position:0%
comfortable with it maybe more and and
uh

00:49:05.150 --> 00:49:05.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:49:07.790 --> 00:49:07.800 align:start position:0%
and you know if we if we get an answer
 
00:49:09.170 --> 00:49:09.180 align:start position:0%
if I get an answer I'll let the
 
00:49:11.510 --> 00:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
subcommittee know and I think if it's
 
00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
clearly something like this
 
00:49:16.010 --> 00:49:16.020 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:49:17.930 --> 00:49:17.940 align:start position:0%
um you know if we get language to deal
 
00:49:19.730 --> 00:49:19.740 align:start position:0%
with the conflict with hb2 on the other
 
00:49:19.740 --> 00:49:21.530 align:start position:0%
with the conflict with hb2 on the other
bill

00:49:21.530 --> 00:49:21.540 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:49:23.990 --> 00:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
um and I can get a proposed amendment
 
00:49:27.170 --> 00:49:27.180 align:start position:0%
drafted and send it around I think that
 
00:49:28.309 --> 00:49:28.319 align:start position:0%
um you know if those are true the
 
00:49:29.870 --> 00:49:29.880 align:start position:0%
follow-up meeting could be quite short
 
00:49:32.569 --> 00:49:32.579 align:start position:0%
and could even schedule it like at 9 00
 
00:49:34.609 --> 00:49:34.619 align:start position:0%
a.m before when we exact next you don't
 
00:49:38.030 --> 00:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:40.130 --> 00:49:40.140 align:start position:0%
any other comments
 
00:49:44.450 --> 00:49:44.460 align:start position:0%
Mr chair yeah just one uh I'm not sure
 
00:49:50.930 --> 00:49:50.940 align:start position:0%
what your version of 106 is but if you
 
00:49:54.170 --> 00:49:54.180 align:start position:0%
have a version that says in lines one
 
00:49:58.309 --> 00:49:58.319 align:start position:0%
through ten an amendment to 170 e 11.
 
00:50:00.050 --> 00:50:00.060 align:start position:0%
this is Page
 
00:50:03.770 --> 00:50:03.780 align:start position:0%
um on page one one through ten
 
00:50:07.069 --> 00:50:07.079 align:start position:0%
yeah and 17 by inserting the paragraph
 
00:50:08.450 --> 00:50:08.460 align:start position:0%
and at
 
00:50:10.670 --> 00:50:10.680 align:start position:0%
after subparagraph and the following you
 
00:50:10.680 --> 00:50:11.390 align:start position:0%
after subparagraph and the following you
know

00:50:11.390 --> 00:50:11.400 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:50:18.410 --> 00:50:18.420 align:start position:0%
but a men's RSA 170e colon 11. yep that
 
00:50:20.630 --> 00:50:20.640 align:start position:0%
was the way this originally came out of
 
00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:22.130 align:start position:0%
was the way this originally came out of
OLS

00:50:22.130 --> 00:50:22.140 align:start position:0%
OLS
 
00:50:24.770 --> 00:50:24.780 align:start position:0%
and that should not be part of this bill
 
00:50:26.270 --> 00:50:26.280 align:start position:0%
any longer
 
00:50:30.230 --> 00:50:30.240 align:start position:0%
and why is that because this section of
 
00:50:32.569 --> 00:50:32.579 align:start position:0%
the statute is relative to the daycare
 
00:50:35.270 --> 00:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
center licensing day care center
 
00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:38.030 align:start position:0%
center licensing day care center
licensing

00:50:38.030 --> 00:50:38.040 align:start position:0%
licensing
 
00:50:41.870 --> 00:50:41.880 align:start position:0%
what begins on line 11 is the amendment
 
00:50:45.650 --> 00:50:45.660 align:start position:0%
that was asked for by the department
 
00:50:49.970 --> 00:50:49.980 align:start position:0%
to make sure that this bill amends 170 e
 
00:50:55.010 --> 00:50:55.020 align:start position:0%
colon 50. okay that is the statute that
 
00:50:58.849 --> 00:50:58.859 align:start position:0%
is related to credentialing of personnel
 
00:51:02.270 --> 00:51:02.280 align:start position:0%
not like not centers but Personnel all
 
00:51:04.790 --> 00:51:04.800 align:start position:0%
right let me take a look
 
00:51:07.010 --> 00:51:07.020 align:start position:0%
I'm getting mine online and they all say
 
00:51:09.710 --> 00:51:09.720 align:start position:0%
170 11. yeah so that's how it came out
 
00:51:12.530 --> 00:51:12.540 align:start position:0%
of the Senate apparently and um on the
 
00:51:14.690 --> 00:51:14.700 align:start position:0%
first on the first line and then on line
 
00:51:19.010 --> 00:51:19.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:21.650 --> 00:51:21.660 align:start position:0%
that uh so basically there it is okay I
 
00:51:23.270 --> 00:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
see it now and it says number two
 
00:51:25.130 --> 00:51:25.140 align:start position:0%
basically you'd want to remove section
 
00:51:27.650 --> 00:51:27.660 align:start position:0%
one yes okay
 
00:51:28.910 --> 00:51:28.920 align:start position:0%
um so we're gonna need Amendment anyway
 
00:51:32.750 --> 00:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
you do okay okay then that solves that
 
00:51:35.270 --> 00:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
problem right there I I'm sorry I gotta
 
00:51:39.049 --> 00:51:39.059 align:start position:0%
fess up here but but that's uh
 
00:51:42.109 --> 00:51:42.119 align:start position:0%
yeah we have gotten some bills there's
 
00:51:43.670 --> 00:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
two I mean as a matter by the second
 
00:51:45.829 --> 00:51:45.839 align:start position:0%
Senate second
 
00:51:48.650 --> 00:51:48.660 align:start position:0%
let me make sure no they bought yeah
 
00:51:52.069 --> 00:51:52.079 align:start position:0%
the 170 E11 thing is there
 
00:51:55.849 --> 00:51:55.859 align:start position:0%
and so this not having this
 
00:51:57.770 --> 00:51:57.780 align:start position:0%
there's no need for some equivalent
 
00:51:59.690 --> 00:51:59.700 align:start position:0%
language somewhere else it's not needed
 
00:52:02.030 --> 00:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
Jake could you get some wording on that
 
00:52:04.309 --> 00:52:04.319 align:start position:0%
to us please well it sounds like it just
 
00:52:05.870 --> 00:52:05.880 align:start position:0%
needs the amendment just needs so we
 
00:52:07.309 --> 00:52:07.319 align:start position:0%
know what it needs to look like exactly
 
00:52:10.010 --> 00:52:10.020 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll hand this to you okay thank
 
00:52:12.829 --> 00:52:12.839 align:start position:0%
you but I assume it's just or correct me
 
00:52:14.450 --> 00:52:14.460 align:start position:0%
if I'm wrong it's just
 
00:52:14.460 --> 00:52:15.589 align:start position:0%
if I'm wrong it's just
um

00:52:15.589 --> 00:52:15.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:18.049 --> 00:52:18.059 align:start position:0%
you know take this do an amendment that
 
00:52:20.569 --> 00:52:20.579 align:start position:0%
removes section one yes right and would
 
00:52:22.790 --> 00:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
renumber the other sections yes usual
 
00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:23.930 align:start position:0%
renumber the other sections yes usual
thing

00:52:23.930 --> 00:52:23.940 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:52:26.390 --> 00:52:26.400 align:start position:0%
okay and uh yeah if you can give me a
 
00:52:30.349 --> 00:52:30.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:31.670 --> 00:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
you can actually just scan it at home
 
00:52:34.490 --> 00:52:34.500 align:start position:0%
email which it's easy all right thank
 
00:52:36.230 --> 00:52:36.240 align:start position:0%
you and I'm going to close the unless
 
00:52:38.030 --> 00:52:38.040 align:start position:0%
there's anything else in the committee
 
00:52:40.069 --> 00:52:40.079 align:start position:0%
I'm going to close the subcommittee work
 
00:52:43.190 --> 00:52:43.200 align:start position:0%
session on SB 106.
 
00:53:13.730 --> 00:53:13.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:13.740 --> 00:53:16.740 align:start position:0%
