00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
that's why okay so
 
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:10.480 align:start position:0%
if i could start um there were four
 
00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:15.920 align:start position:0%
had a lot of support the first was
 
00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
senate bill 68
 
00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
that's the governor's bill that senator
 
00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 align:start position:0%
hennessey introduced for him upon
 
00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
pregnancy i believe he retained it there
 
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:25.840 align:start position:0%
was no opposition
 
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:30.160 align:start position:0%
to the bill except for one
 
00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:32.480 align:start position:0%
out of state attorney that just raised
 
00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 align:start position:0%
some questions that were resolved
 
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.000 align:start position:0%
we had the executive director
 
00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:41.840 align:start position:0%
of the human rights commission ms
 
00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:44.559 align:start position:0%
malachi wrightville
 
00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:48.079 align:start position:0%
it was caught up in house bill 1234 last
 
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 align:start position:0%
year so kind of vetoed
 
00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 align:start position:0%
so it's been through the process twice
 
00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 align:start position:0%
so there's no opposition twice
 
00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 align:start position:0%
and we're a little bit perplexed as to
 
00:00:58.709 --> 00:00:58.719 align:start position:0%
you know why
 
00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 align:start position:0%
it got retained that's number one number
 
00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.229 align:start position:0%
it got retained that's number one number
two

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:06.159 align:start position:0%
senate bill 69 um the breastfeeding bill
 
00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:08.799 align:start position:0%
there's been a huge amount of work over
 
00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 align:start position:0%
the years
 
00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 align:start position:0%
on that bill uh consensus support again
 
00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 align:start position:0%
no opposition
 
00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 align:start position:0%
uh to that bill um clearly
 
00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
both of these bills pregnancy bill and
 
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 align:start position:0%
the breastfeeding bill are very
 
00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 align:start position:0%
important workforce bills
 
00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 align:start position:0%
to make sure that people have you know
 
00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 align:start position:0%
the opportunity
 
00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
to work and you know whether it's
 
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:31.670 align:start position:0%
to work and you know whether it's
breastfeeding

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
breastfeeding
 
00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 align:start position:0%
pregnancy protection so that bill was
 
00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
retained also and reflects that um
 
00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 align:start position:0%
i'm going to let senator sherman speak
 
00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:45.759 align:start position:0%
to senate bill 59 but i would just add
 
00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:47.190 align:start position:0%
to senate bill 59 but i would just add
the

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 align:start position:0%
piece in uh i think it was senate bill
 
00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
86 dealing with the atlanta conservation
 
00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 align:start position:0%
issue for housing
 
00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 align:start position:0%
again had broad support in the senate
 
00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 align:start position:0%
it had been unfortunately the program
 
00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 align:start position:0%
was appealed 10 years ago
 
00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 align:start position:0%
this reinstitutes it but with no funding
 
00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:09.510 align:start position:0%
this reinstitutes it but with no funding
um

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 align:start position:0%
at a time that affordable housing is
 
00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.990 align:start position:0%
at a time that affordable housing is
adds

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 align:start position:0%
adds
 
00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 align:start position:0%
in short supply many of us think that
 
00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 align:start position:0%
that's an important though so we
 
00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:28.550 align:start position:0%
that's an important though so we
um

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 align:start position:0%
absolutely really quick so one of the
 
00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 align:start position:0%
things i like as an attorney is
 
00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 align:start position:0%
the use of the word reasonable insist
 
00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
and sufficient and again reasonable
 
00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 align:start position:0%
so they're accommodating the employer
 
00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 align:start position:0%
depends on what you have it isn't
 
00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 align:start position:0%
we're not giving you a one-size-all
 
00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 align:start position:0%
thing it's very adaptable
 
00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 align:start position:0%
very flexible so i just like the
 
00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 align:start position:0%
language in both section
 
00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 align:start position:0%
uh 29 and 30. i'm sorry senator sherman
 
00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 align:start position:0%
fully supportive of 68 and 69 i think
 
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 align:start position:0%
they're phenomenal bills i think they've
 
00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 align:start position:0%
had strong bipartisan support
 
00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 align:start position:0%
and and i agree completely
 
00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
with karen bradley that
 
00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 align:start position:0%
they are
 
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.270 align:start position:0%
they are
[Music]

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 align:start position:0%
really critical for workforce especially
 
00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 align:start position:0%
as we look at the impact on women
 
00:03:22.149 --> 00:03:22.159 align:start position:0%
of coba has had a disproportional
 
00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 align:start position:0%
impact on women we need to get them back
 
00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 align:start position:0%
in the workforce
 
00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 align:start position:0%
and especially with our unemployment
 
00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 align:start position:0%
rate being
 
00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 align:start position:0%
impressively low so
 
00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
that being said those are my highest
 
00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:37.599 align:start position:0%
priorities senate bill 59
 
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 align:start position:0%
passed the senate 24 to nothing we are
 
00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
in the middle
 
00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 align:start position:0%
of a mental health crisis
 
00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 align:start position:0%
and senator bradley will attest to the
 
00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 align:start position:0%
fact that we've been listening to the
 
00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 align:start position:0%
carriers say we cover it already and
 
00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 align:start position:0%
they don't that's fundamental here they
 
00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 align:start position:0%
don't cover it
 
00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 align:start position:0%
so this is the standard of practice in
 
00:04:00.869 --> 00:04:00.879 align:start position:0%
psychiatric care the benefits to the
 
00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:01.429 align:start position:0%
psychiatric care the benefits to the
state

00:04:01.429 --> 00:04:01.439 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
would be number one workforce we have
 
00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 align:start position:0%
one of the most challenged psychiatric
 
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 align:start position:0%
workforces in the country
 
00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
we cannot recruit and retain partially
 
00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:10.879 align:start position:0%
because of our size
 
00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 align:start position:0%
most of our psychiatrists come out of
 
00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:14.080 align:start position:0%
the dartmouth program which is a
 
00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 align:start position:0%
wonderful program
 
00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 align:start position:0%
but this is critical not only for
 
00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 align:start position:0%
ease of access for patients it's also
 
00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:27.199 align:start position:0%
important for workforce in terms of
 
00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 align:start position:0%
the availability of psychiatrists and it
 
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.110 align:start position:0%
the availability of psychiatrists and it
ensures

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 align:start position:0%
ensures
 
00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
that this model will get reimbursed and
 
00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
as a doctor
 
00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 align:start position:0%
over and over again i've heard from the
 
00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:41.919 align:start position:0%
carriers that they cover it they don't
 
00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 align:start position:0%
well this is
 
00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:45.199 align:start position:0%
on all sorts of issues but on this one
 
00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 align:start position:0%
that's what we've been told
 
00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919 align:start position:0%
and so at least five states have
 
00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 align:start position:0%
instituted put it into statute so that
 
00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
it would be important you know as well
 
00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
as i can and we've been working for
 
00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 align:start position:0%
years trying to make sure that
 
00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 align:start position:0%
parity is part of the ten year mental
 
00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:02.479 align:start position:0%
health plan
 
00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 align:start position:0%
this dovetails perfectly with the mental
 
00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
health plan dovetails perfectly with the
 
00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
integrated delivery network which we've
 
00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160 align:start position:0%
it's been an
 
00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:12.639 align:start position:0%
awful lot of federal dollars at least 50
 
00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:15.199 align:start position:0%
million dollars that's closing up now
 
00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 align:start position:0%
this is the model that we need i
 
00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.830 align:start position:0%
this is the model that we need i
understand

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 align:start position:0%
understand
 
00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
that they are saying that they cover
 
00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 align:start position:0%
this shouldn't pass
 
00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason this does not make
 
00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:27.280 align:start position:0%
it through this process
 
00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
then the next step for me will be to
 
00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:30.880 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're documenting
 
00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.320 align:start position:0%
any failure of coverage um
 
00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 align:start position:0%
but again we're in the middle of a
 
00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
crisis we don't have time to wait and
 
00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 align:start position:0%
see if the carriers are going to cover
 
00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:42.160 align:start position:0%
we've seen in other areas like er
 
00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:43.840 align:start position:0%
boarding they don't cover it they say
 
00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
they do and they don't
 
00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
sp70 which we held on to in the senate
 
00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.360 align:start position:0%
was an effort to make sure we hold them
 
00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:53.039 align:start position:0%
accountable and
 
00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:57.280 align:start position:0%
you know on all these bills
 
00:05:59.189 --> 00:05:59.199 align:start position:0%
i think this is critical i think it's
 
00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:00.880 align:start position:0%
important that we address the mental
 
00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:01.270 align:start position:0%
important that we address the mental
health

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:01.280 align:start position:0%
health
 
00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
issues i understand
 
00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
the concerns of the chair um
 
00:06:14.309 --> 00:06:14.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:16.400 align:start position:0%
that's it i think this is a critical
 
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:18.840 align:start position:0%
part of our response to mental health
 
00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:22.550 align:start position:0%
part of our response to mental health
crisis

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:26.240 align:start position:0%
okay well we'll start with that one um
 
00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:28.160 align:start position:0%
i mean we need the evidence that that
 
00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:29.680 align:start position:0%
they're not coming
 
00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:33.440 align:start position:0%
don't worry us to say they're the liars
 
00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:35.840 align:start position:0%
so that they tell us that it's not true
 
00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:37.360 align:start position:0%
so it must be in the evidence
 
00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:40.639 align:start position:0%
so yeah i need to build a case
 
00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
clearly you could put the bill in again
 
00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:44.800 align:start position:0%
come back january
 
00:06:47.029 --> 00:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
you know what and i would just say you
 
00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:48.080 align:start position:0%
need to have some evidence
 
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
you need to have it i would i would hope
 
00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:51.110 align:start position:0%
you need to have it i would i would hope
that

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:59.510 --> 00:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
and that they heard you and that they
 
00:07:02.629 --> 00:07:02.639 align:start position:0%
will make sure that uh they are
 
00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
government and that and to me that would
 
00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:06.309 align:start position:0%
government and that and to me that would
be

00:07:06.309 --> 00:07:06.319 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
even more effective if we get them to
 
00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
cover it without and i would be
 
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
100 agreement with that i i
 
00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:17.360 align:start position:0%
i would love to see that happen
 
00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
okay next uh we'll take the these two
 
00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:23.680 align:start position:0%
uh so let me just if i could add i was
 
00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:24.400 align:start position:0%
going to talk about that
 
00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:27.440 align:start position:0%
59 yeah um
 
00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:29.120 align:start position:0%
you know i think it's really important
 
00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:30.880 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at the hero report of the
 
00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.150 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at the hero report of the
senate

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
senate
 
00:07:35.749 --> 00:07:35.759 align:start position:0%
we talk about evidence okay um
 
00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:37.360 align:start position:0%
the support for the bill was
 
00:07:39.749 --> 00:07:39.759 align:start position:0%
overwhelming from
 
00:07:43.029 --> 00:07:43.039 align:start position:0%
you know folks in the field patrick hold
 
00:07:45.749 --> 00:07:45.759 align:start position:0%

00:07:48.629 --> 00:07:48.639 align:start position:0%

who's here from dartmouth kim norton for
nami

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
nami
 
00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:07.840 align:start position:0%
um no opposition to the bill not zero
 
00:08:10.869 --> 00:08:10.879 align:start position:0%
and i think that you know senator
 
00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:13.280 align:start position:0%
sherman um
 
00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
you know it's pretty well connected in
 
00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
the medical fields or
 
00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:19.360 align:start position:0%
what's actually happening so we were
 
00:08:21.189 --> 00:08:21.199 align:start position:0%
kind of mystified
 
00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:24.160 align:start position:0%
with the kind of support for a model
 
00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:24.720 align:start position:0%
that has
 
00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:28.400 align:start position:0%
no opposition having it in law makes it
 
00:08:32.149 --> 00:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
clear that reimbursement for this model
 
00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:33.919 align:start position:0%
of collaborative care which
 
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
allows more participation by
 
00:08:40.149 --> 00:08:40.159 align:start position:0%
different health care workers at a time
 
00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:42.320 align:start position:0%
that we know we have shortages
 
00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
in particular of mental health workers
 
00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
is pretty
 
00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
important and so i think that the
 
00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
you know the fact that folks that
 
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:55.120 align:start position:0%
we all listen to who i just cited um
 
00:08:57.990 --> 00:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
had you know universal support from the
 
00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.190 align:start position:0%
had you know universal support from the
carriers

00:08:59.190 --> 00:08:59.200 align:start position:0%
carriers
 
00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
to the healthcare professionals i i just
 
00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:02.550 align:start position:0%
to the healthcare professionals i i just
again

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:04.720 align:start position:0%
it's mystifying why we didn't afford
 
00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:07.509 align:start position:0%
it's mystifying why we didn't afford
them

00:09:07.509 --> 00:09:07.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:10.240 align:start position:0%
yes i have to agree um you know 59 was
 
00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:12.560 align:start position:0%
one that we did hear from both sides
 
00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:14.080 align:start position:0%
um well there really was an opposition
 
00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
to it and the fact that
 
00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:18.320 align:start position:0%
um many of our patients are they see
 
00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:20.240 align:start position:0%
their pcp and they have a
 
00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:21.760 align:start position:0%
closer relationship with them than they
 
00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:23.680 align:start position:0%
do with mental health um
 
00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:26.240 align:start position:0%
professionals and if they can work
 
00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:27.190 align:start position:0%
professionals and if they can work
together

00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:27.200 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:29.200 align:start position:0%
um what if medication is necessary if
 
00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:30.640 align:start position:0%
counseling is necessary
 
00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:32.800 align:start position:0%
and it keeps them from having to go to
 
00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
another provider
 
00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
which in some case in some cases would
 
00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
prevent them from getting
 
00:09:41.269 --> 00:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
further care so um you know certainly i
 
00:09:41.279 --> 00:09:41.910 align:start position:0%
further care so um you know certainly i
think

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:44.720 align:start position:0%
and and supported 59 and would like to
 
00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
so um the issue really is that if it's
 
00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:52.710 align:start position:0%
so um the issue really is that if it's
already

00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:52.720 align:start position:0%
already
 
00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
covered then why do we need it i would
 
00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:56.720 align:start position:0%
agree with you
 
00:09:59.190 --> 00:09:59.200 align:start position:0%
but we're you know certainly what we
 
00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:00.240 align:start position:0%
have heard i think
 
00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
senator sherman more than anybody else
 
00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:03.680 align:start position:0%
because he is
 
00:10:05.509 --> 00:10:05.519 align:start position:0%
in the field every day different
 
00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:07.120 align:start position:0%
practice obviously
 
00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:10.480 align:start position:0%
but uh really well connected people are
 
00:10:12.069 --> 00:10:12.079 align:start position:0%
telling us
 
00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
and you know as we'll probably
 
00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:18.720 align:start position:0%
see senate bill 70 next session and keep
 
00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:20.320 align:start position:0%
hearing things are covered but then we
 
00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
keep hearing things
 
00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:24.800 align:start position:0%
or not so um
 
00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:26.720 align:start position:0%
i think we all know that we need to get
 
00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
to the bottom of it
 
00:10:30.829 --> 00:10:30.839 align:start position:0%
it'd be one thing if there was any
 
00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:32.480 align:start position:0%
opposition to the building
 
00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:36.160 align:start position:0%
there's not and and that's the fun
 
00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
i mean i say there's no opposition no
 
00:10:39.509 --> 00:10:39.519 align:start position:0%
because it's already law
 
00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:43.120 align:start position:0%
it's not law it's already
 
00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:51.509 --> 00:10:51.519 align:start position:0%
but then we hear the
 
00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
people aren't getting covered for this
 
00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
model of care that there's no opposition
 
00:10:57.269 --> 00:10:57.279 align:start position:0%
to the bomb
 
00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:00.240 align:start position:0%
and it's already reimbursed for medicaid
 
00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
and medicare
 
00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:05.440 align:start position:0%
so again but i'm sure they don't have it
 
00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:06.640 align:start position:0%
in the rules that that's just been
 
00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:07.829 align:start position:0%
in the rules that that's just been
covered

00:11:07.829 --> 00:11:07.839 align:start position:0%
covered
 
00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
so i'm saying is why why would we want
 
00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
to think
 
00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:12.720 align:start position:0%
i mean there's a lot of things out there
 
00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
that you know you say these are you know
 
00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:16.160 align:start position:0%
midday or things that are being covered
 
00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
that we should have in the statute
 
00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
we only put things in the statute is
 
00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
when we actually
 
00:11:24.069 --> 00:11:24.079 align:start position:0%
have evidence that companies are not
 
00:11:26.389 --> 00:11:26.399 align:start position:0%
we're missing the big picture when we
 
00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
sort of get into that kind of detail
 
00:11:31.269 --> 00:11:31.279 align:start position:0%
whether it's in the statute or not we
 
00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:33.200 align:start position:0%
believe it's not being covered
 
00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:36.320 align:start position:0%
despite um some of the assurances you've
 
00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:36.790 align:start position:0%
despite um some of the assurances you've
gotten

00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:36.800 align:start position:0%
gotten
 
00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:38.720 align:start position:0%
and there's no opposition to having it
 
00:11:41.509 --> 00:11:41.519 align:start position:0%
in statute so whether it's in statute
 
00:11:45.269 --> 00:11:45.279 align:start position:0%
and not being enforced or
 
00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
or whether it's a practice but not being
 
00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
enforced or being
 
00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
reimbursed or whether patients have to
 
00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:53.440 align:start position:0%
advocate for
 
00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
individual care i think that's a problem
 
00:11:58.710 --> 00:11:58.720 align:start position:0%
because there are many that will be able
 
00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:01.360 align:start position:0%
to advocate for themselves
 
00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
we you know we do have things in stature
 
00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:06.800 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it's usually in psychiatry
 
00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:09.440 align:start position:0%
we have parody builds in statute because
 
00:12:10.069 --> 00:12:10.079 align:start position:0%
there was not
 
00:12:13.829 --> 00:12:13.839 align:start position:0%
parody and in the senate hearing
 
00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:16.880 align:start position:0%
we heard that yes as far as we know
 
00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
anthem covers it we don't know that all
 
00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:19.990 align:start position:0%
anthem covers it we don't know that all
carriers

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
carriers
 
00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
cover it we heard from heidi that it
 
00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
should be covered and that's why they
 
00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:26.480 align:start position:0%
were actually on board with it this sets
 
00:12:28.949 --> 00:12:28.959 align:start position:0%
the standard of practice and psychiatry
 
00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
i agree 100 we don't need to put
 
00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
standard of sedation for colonoscopy in
 
00:12:35.509 --> 00:12:35.519 align:start position:0%
the statute
 
00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
it's covered it's done and
 
00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:41.600 align:start position:0%
but in areas where we have deficiencies
 
00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
where we also have a crisis
 
00:12:46.949 --> 00:12:46.959 align:start position:0%
it actually is a role for statute and
 
00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
we've done that
 
00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:49.600 align:start position:0%
there is a precedent for it in
 
00:12:51.509 --> 00:12:51.519 align:start position:0%
psychiatry in the parity
 
00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:54.160 align:start position:0%
this is part of the ten year plan this
 
00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
is part of
 
00:12:57.910 --> 00:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
how we respond as a state to the fact
 
00:12:58.710 --> 00:12:58.720 align:start position:0%
that we
 
00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:00.320 align:start position:0%
still have people boarding in our
 
00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
obviously we have to uphold the house
 
00:13:08.949 --> 00:13:08.959 align:start position:0%
position the house did vote on this
 
00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
right but with further evidence that i
 
00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
you know we've gone to the ends of the
 
00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:30.470 align:start position:0%
you know we've gone to the ends of the
earth

00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
earth
 
00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
financing thank you for proceeding
 
00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
on or concurring i mean on 143
 
00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
you know a licensure bill hopefully the
 
00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:41.590 align:start position:0%
you know a licensure bill hopefully the
secure

00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
secure
 
00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
psychiatric hospital gets funded in the
 
00:13:45.189 --> 00:13:45.199 align:start position:0%
budget i mean
 
00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:48.160 align:start position:0%
you know so i just see no reason not to
 
00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
move forward with this bill if it's just
 
00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:53.120 align:start position:0%
you know to uphold the house position i
 
00:13:55.509 --> 00:13:55.519 align:start position:0%
get it because i've been in your shoes
 
00:13:58.470 --> 00:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
but i i hope that you can understand the
 
00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:00.240 align:start position:0%
in the middle of a crisis where we're
 
00:14:01.189 --> 00:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
trying to move
 
00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
heaven and earth to get resources to
 
00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
people that need
 
00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
the resources for mental health
 
00:14:08.389 --> 00:14:08.399 align:start position:0%
counseling and treatment
 
00:14:12.069 --> 00:14:12.079 align:start position:0%
that you would reconsider
 
00:14:25.189 --> 00:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:27.509 --> 00:14:27.519 align:start position:0%
show me the evidence tell me that the
 
00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
insurance companies are not covering it
 
00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:32.240 align:start position:0%
but show me the opposition to it and and
 
00:14:32.949 --> 00:14:32.959 align:start position:0%
i will
 
00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
the opposition is in in terms of
 
00:14:37.509 --> 00:14:37.519 align:start position:0%
because that's a nitpick the
 
00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:40.480 align:start position:0%
conversation that you're nitpicking us
 
00:14:43.269 --> 00:14:43.279 align:start position:0%
in the middle of a crisis that when
 
00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:44.800 align:start position:0%
there's no opposition to
 
00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:48.800 align:start position:0%
a care model and it's important to have
 
00:14:51.829 --> 00:14:51.839 align:start position:0%
it clear for reimbursement purposes
 
00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:55.360 align:start position:0%
the fact that um you know
 
00:14:58.629 --> 00:14:58.639 align:start position:0%
you're holding on to a position because
 
00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:00.160 align:start position:0%
you voted it down
 
00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
it just i understand the dynamic of it
 
00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:03.350 align:start position:0%
it just i understand the dynamic of it
but

00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:15:05.189 --> 00:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
it just seems in the middle of a crisis
 
00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
there'd be a little bit more open
 
00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:07.430 align:start position:0%
there'd be a little bit more open
mindedness

00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
mindedness
 
00:15:10.949 --> 00:15:10.959 align:start position:0%
okay all right my final government is
 
00:15:10.959 --> 00:15:11.990 align:start position:0%
okay all right my final government is
okay

00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
when you say care model okay um
 
00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:17.120 align:start position:0%
as uh but little i know about health
 
00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:18.230 align:start position:0%
as uh but little i know about health
insurance

00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
uh everything is driven about what are
 
00:15:22.069 --> 00:15:22.079 align:start position:0%
the standards of care
 
00:15:24.389 --> 00:15:24.399 align:start position:0%
okay and what then the sense of care
 
00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
which is
 
00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
generally accepted practices okay
 
00:15:31.749 --> 00:15:31.759 align:start position:0%
um if you say four states
 
00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
have done this now i think it's seven or
 
00:15:35.189 --> 00:15:35.199 align:start position:0%
eight okay
 
00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:38.560 align:start position:0%
so so the issue really is that in terms
 
00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:39.189 align:start position:0%
so so the issue really is that in terms
of

00:15:39.189 --> 00:15:39.199 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:15:40.949 --> 00:15:40.959 align:start position:0%
what is going on in the nation why is
 
00:15:42.629 --> 00:15:42.639 align:start position:0%
this the national state
 
00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:44.320 align:start position:0%
if if the insurance companies are
 
00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
telling us it is
 
00:15:49.189 --> 00:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
and we have no particular reason not to
 
00:15:51.189 --> 00:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
believe them unless you're going to find
 
00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
evidence to show us where the refusals
 
00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
and that it's cur occurring and that we
 
00:15:57.829 --> 00:15:57.839 align:start position:0%
can't you know
 
00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
can't correct it then i would say yes
 
00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
then it's worth you know
 
00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
then you need to put it but the idea of
 
00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
putting in this model
 
00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:08.240 align:start position:0%
legislation that's supposed to be the
 
00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
standard of care that everybody
 
00:16:13.269 --> 00:16:13.279 align:start position:0%
should be doing uh is a problem for me
 
00:16:15.269 --> 00:16:15.279 align:start position:0%
because there would be a lot of that
 
00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
stuff we would stick in the book so then
 
00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:18.240 align:start position:0%
it just becomes
 
00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:20.480 align:start position:0%
uh you know more more mandates that
 
00:16:22.389 --> 00:16:22.399 align:start position:0%
nobody you know nobody reads or care or
 
00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:24.160 align:start position:0%
evidently following or something i don't
 
00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:24.790 align:start position:0%
evidently following or something i don't
know

00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:24.800 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:16:27.749 --> 00:16:27.759 align:start position:0%
so and our our attitude is right now is
 
00:16:27.759 --> 00:16:28.470 align:start position:0%
so and our our attitude is right now is
that

00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:28.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:16:34.829 --> 00:16:34.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:38.949 --> 00:16:38.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:42.720 align:start position:0%
okay let's go on to 68-69 okay
 
00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
um the problem that the the committee
 
00:16:47.269 --> 00:16:47.279 align:start position:0%
had with 687
 
00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:50.320 align:start position:0%
and i'll have to be frank um uh my my
 
00:16:51.829 --> 00:16:51.839 align:start position:0%
drums would have been that
 
00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:54.160 align:start position:0%
uh we we didn't even have this sessions
 
00:16:54.949 --> 00:16:54.959 align:start position:0%
you know we
 
00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:57.360 align:start position:0%
just retained everything and and wait
 
00:16:58.470 --> 00:16:58.480 align:start position:0%
till september
 
00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:00.240 align:start position:0%
and have her session then but of course
 
00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
that that was just my personal opinion
 
00:17:06.069 --> 00:17:06.079 align:start position:0%
when it comes to a commerce committee
 
00:17:09.669 --> 00:17:09.679 align:start position:0%
as you uh probably know we do a lot by
 
00:17:12.949 --> 00:17:12.959 align:start position:0%
subcommittee we would do
 
00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
every bill by something that every bill
 
00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:16.400 align:start position:0%
would have another
 
00:17:17.909 --> 00:17:17.919 align:start position:0%
opportunity to have a little discussion
 
00:17:19.909 --> 00:17:19.919 align:start position:0%
before so that by the time we get to the
 
00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
full committee we pretty much know where
 
00:17:24.309 --> 00:17:24.319 align:start position:0%
we're going with it um i made a
 
00:17:25.909 --> 00:17:25.919 align:start position:0%
commitment that we would not have any
 
00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
subcommittees this year
 
00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
because the idea of doing subcommittees
 
00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:30.880 align:start position:0%
on the zoom session
 
00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:34.640 align:start position:0%
just didn't seem right or workable
 
00:17:38.549 --> 00:17:38.559 align:start position:0%
we like that free throw
 
00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:41.440 align:start position:0%
communication that occurs so um the
 
00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:43.280 align:start position:0%
reason we retained these bills were that
 
00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
that their
 
00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
committee members definitely had
 
00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:47.200 align:start position:0%
questions and
 
00:17:49.029 --> 00:17:49.039 align:start position:0%
they're some of the words were being
 
00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
used legal words and things that that
 
00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:52.400 align:start position:0%
you know a lot of people wanted to
 
00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:53.440 align:start position:0%
make sure they understood the
 
00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
consequences and understood it and then
 
00:17:57.990 --> 00:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
the comment came out to that that the
 
00:17:59.430 --> 00:17:59.440 align:start position:0%
human rights commission is actually
 
00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
doing it already
 
00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
so that they don't you know so why are
 
00:18:04.789 --> 00:18:04.799 align:start position:0%
we passing a statute if they're already
 
00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
doing it
 
00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:07.600 align:start position:0%
that they already have the authority
 
00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
that when we created the human rights
 
00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
commission they have the authority to
 
00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:10.789 align:start position:0%
commission they have the authority to
internet

00:18:10.789 --> 00:18:10.799 align:start position:0%
internet
 
00:18:12.789 --> 00:18:12.799 align:start position:0%
so when that piece finally came out that
 
00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
was okay they threw up our hands and we
 
00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:15.270 align:start position:0%
was okay they threw up our hands and we
said

00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
said
 
00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
that let's just retain these two and and
 
00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:20.320 align:start position:0%
work them through the sum come september
 
00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
and hopefully
 
00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:23.440 align:start position:0%
we'll have something you know to get out
 
00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:24.720 align:start position:0%
of committee come
 
00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:27.440 align:start position:0%
you know be on the floor next january i
 
00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:28.880 align:start position:0%
think i have to take exception with some
 
00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
of what
 
00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:33.440 align:start position:0%
your recall is on that this chair um
 
00:18:35.909 --> 00:18:35.919 align:start position:0%
we went through both of these bills um
 
00:18:37.669 --> 00:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
previously and they were passed
 
00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:40.840 align:start position:0%
um both on voice vote and then they were
 
00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
lost the covet
 
00:18:44.549 --> 00:18:44.559 align:start position:0%
only buses these haven't changed they've
 
00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:45.200 align:start position:0%
been worked on
 
00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
through both 68 and 69 have been worked
 
00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
on over and again there's a
 
00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of support for them we
 
00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:52.400 align:start position:0%
had um
 
00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
huge numbers of the of testimony on both
 
00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
of them and
 
00:18:57.909 --> 00:18:57.919 align:start position:0%
the questions really came up from new
 
00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:00.480 align:start position:0%
members of the committee that weren't
 
00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
involved in all of the work we did in it
 
00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
in the past
 
00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:06.400 align:start position:0%
so i think you know both of these bills
 
00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:07.200 align:start position:0%
are um
 
00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
are ones that a tremendous amount of
 
00:19:11.909 --> 00:19:11.919 align:start position:0%
work has but it's really important to
 
00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
um as senator sherman was saying about
 
00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
getting women back into the
 
00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:19.200 align:start position:0%
workforce and feeling safe um that they
 
00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:22.400 align:start position:0%
can be nursing or can be pregnant and um
 
00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:23.270 align:start position:0%
can be nursing or can be pregnant and um
there

00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
there's accommodation in the bill that
 
00:19:27.029 --> 00:19:27.039 align:start position:0%
if it
 
00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:30.880 align:start position:0%
it's um a problem for the business
 
00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
then they can give cause that
 
00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
something they may not be able to comply
 
00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
with um would still be considered
 
00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:40.960 align:start position:0%
so i i certainly hope that we would uh
 
00:19:41.909 --> 00:19:41.919 align:start position:0%
move forward
 
00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
because the the sense in that in the
 
00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:45.280 align:start position:0%
committee really was that
 
00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:47.200 align:start position:0%
these these both of these bills have
 
00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
have been worked on tremendously already
 
00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:52.160 align:start position:0%
well i think you said it right now i
 
00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
said we have new members on the
 
00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:55.750 align:start position:0%
said we have new members on the
committee

00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:19:58.390 --> 00:19:58.400 align:start position:0%
things changed well they weren't able to
 
00:19:58.400 --> 00:19:59.270 align:start position:0%
things changed well they weren't able to
hear

00:19:59.270 --> 00:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
hear
 
00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:04.240 align:start position:0%
um everything all at once um
 
00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:13.290 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:15.990 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
so if i might we're sort of in the same
 
00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:20.310 align:start position:0%
so if i might we're sort of in the same
dilemma

00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:20.320 align:start position:0%
dilemma
 
00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
on cynical 68 as you probably
 
00:20:26.149 --> 00:20:26.159 align:start position:0%
are the underlying which we all support
 
00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:28.400 align:start position:0%
and my understanding is that
 
00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
that bill also got caught up in 1234
 
00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
last year as did senate bill 68 or the
 
00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:37.600 align:start position:0%
earlier version but
 
00:20:39.669 --> 00:20:39.679 align:start position:0%
it was my lesson responsible for the
 
00:20:39.679 --> 00:20:40.710 align:start position:0%
it was my lesson responsible for the
government

00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:40.720 align:start position:0%
government
 
00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
um i just think it'd be a darn shame to
 
00:20:46.789 --> 00:20:46.799 align:start position:0%
you know not move forward with a bill
 
00:20:48.149 --> 00:20:48.159 align:start position:0%
that had you know
 
00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
broad support no opposition especially
 
00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
once the out of state attorney had
 
00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
you know the questions answered was
 
00:20:57.669 --> 00:20:57.679 align:start position:0%
written by ms maliki
 
00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
of the human rights commission
 
00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
that we couldn't move forward with the
 
00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:05.350 align:start position:0%
that we couldn't move forward with the
bill

00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:05.360 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
because we're unable to have zoom sub
 
00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
commission which again
 
00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:13.280 align:start position:0%
that to me is it's i don't know
 
00:21:16.149 --> 00:21:16.159 align:start position:0%
um i feel like we're in a samuel beckham
 
00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
play waiting for godot
 
00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:19.360 align:start position:0%
the same thing happens over and over
 
00:21:21.029 --> 00:21:21.039 align:start position:0%
again um
 
00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
on both the underlying bill and senate
 
00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
bill 68
 
00:21:28.149 --> 00:21:28.159 align:start position:0%
without a reasonable explanation as to
 
00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
why we're not moving forward with it
 
00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
because i think everybody would agree
 
00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
at least i hope that the way the bill is
 
00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
constructed that there should be
 
00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:40.240 align:start position:0%
reasonable accommodations for pregnant
 
00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:41.190 align:start position:0%
reasonable accommodations for pregnant
employees

00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:41.200 align:start position:0%
employees
 
00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
i i don't i suspect there's no
 
00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:45.280 align:start position:0%
opposition to that
 
00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:48.320 align:start position:0%
there certainly wasn't in you know the
 
00:21:52.549 --> 00:21:52.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:54.789 --> 00:21:54.799 align:start position:0%
did you have a subcommittee on six times
 
00:21:54.799 --> 00:21:55.750 align:start position:0%
did you have a subcommittee on six times
we

00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:21:57.750 --> 00:21:57.760 align:start position:0%
no we haven't had any subcommittees so
 
00:21:59.909 --> 00:21:59.919 align:start position:0%
how did it pass that these others
 
00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
don't pass because there's no subjects
 
00:22:04.789 --> 00:22:04.799 align:start position:0%
they're they're in the same bill
 
00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
they're in the same book as you put in
 
00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
no no they're in the same omnibus bill
 
00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
last year that passed the house in the
 
00:22:10.549 --> 00:22:10.559 align:start position:0%
senate six
 
00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:12.880 align:start position:0%
ten you know terms you know you it was
 
00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:14.240 align:start position:0%
an honest bill because you
 
00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:16.960 align:start position:0%
put it into anonymous building okay so
 
00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:17.350 align:start position:0%
put it into anonymous building okay so
that

00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:21.760 align:start position:0%
that so anyway 610 uh is a
 
00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
banking department bill it was a
 
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.830 align:start position:0%
banking department bill it was a
standalone

00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
standalone
 
00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:28.240 align:start position:0%
and and so there was you know in terms
 
00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:30.640 align:start position:0%
of it's not about the omnibus and
 
00:22:32.149 --> 00:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
whether it's hacking it or not like that
 
00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
it was that this issue
 
00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
had been addressed it had been worked on
 
00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
its issues
 
00:22:39.909 --> 00:22:39.919 align:start position:0%
you started out as a study committee and
 
00:22:40.549 --> 00:22:40.559 align:start position:0%
we had all
 
00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:42.400 align:start position:0%
the issues resolved and things you know
 
00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:44.400 align:start position:0%
that that was a couple years ago so
 
00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
it's really a shame to have it die
 
00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
because you guys put all these
 
00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
non-demand amendments
 
00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
on on a commerce bill that that that
 
00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
is a housekeeping measure if i could
 
00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:00.400 align:start position:0%
you just said that 6869
 
00:23:02.149 --> 00:23:02.159 align:start position:0%
even though they previously passed the
 
00:23:02.159 --> 00:23:03.830 align:start position:0%
even though they previously passed the
house

00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
house
 
00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
in the same bill as 610.
 
00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:10.640 align:start position:0%
had to have a subcommittee i don't know
 
00:23:13.029 --> 00:23:13.039 align:start position:0%
they were equally vetted at 6 10.
 
00:23:16.149 --> 00:23:16.159 align:start position:0%
uh no well the difference being
 
00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
is that that we obviously did have a
 
00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:20.480 align:start position:0%
change in
 
00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
human alliance and we have an election
 
00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
no i understand
 
00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:26.320 align:start position:0%
elections unfortunately have
 
00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
consequences that we had a lot of new
 
00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:28.870 align:start position:0%
consequences that we had a lot of new
members

00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:32.320 align:start position:0%
so when it came to 610 the banking bill
 
00:23:33.990 --> 00:23:34.000 align:start position:0%
the new members had no problems
 
00:23:35.669 --> 00:23:35.679 align:start position:0%
understanding and getting their arms
 
00:23:35.679 --> 00:23:35.990 align:start position:0%
understanding and getting their arms
around

00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
around
 
00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
the issues when it came to 1669 the new
 
00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:39.190 align:start position:0%
the issues when it came to 1669 the new
members

00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:39.200 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
clearly were not ready so let me just
 
00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:42.320 align:start position:0%
pass that
 
00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:44.240 align:start position:0%
if i could just be absolutely crystal
 
00:23:46.710 --> 00:23:46.720 align:start position:0%
clear from that medical standpoint from
 
00:23:48.149 --> 00:23:48.159 align:start position:0%
the health care standpoint
 
00:23:50.149 --> 00:23:50.159 align:start position:0%
a lactating or pregnant mother who does
 
00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:51.440 align:start position:0%
not have a combination
 
00:23:54.789 --> 00:23:54.799 align:start position:0%
cannot physically work in a place that
 
00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
does not provide that combination
 
00:23:59.590 --> 00:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
just want to be clear on that so we are
 
00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:01.350 align:start position:0%
just want to be clear on that so we are
putting

00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
putting
 
00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
the fact that members
 
00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:07.120 align:start position:0%
are uncomfortable with pregnant or
 
00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
lactating women
 
00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
above a banking bill and we're saying
 
00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
that's two different standards
 
00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
and so with you're asking us to pass a
 
00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
banking bill which i fully support
 
00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:24.880 align:start position:0%
they are equally vetted and you're
 
00:24:27.269 --> 00:24:27.279 align:start position:0%
saying that your committees
 
00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
will at the very least delay
 
00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:34.240 align:start position:0%
action on this for up to a year
 
00:24:38.549 --> 00:24:38.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:40.390 --> 00:24:40.400 align:start position:0%
you didn't put it in again well it's
 
00:24:42.149 --> 00:24:42.159 align:start position:0%
retained these are both retained
 
00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:45.200 align:start position:0%
right we're working on it so we'll have
 
00:24:46.549 --> 00:24:46.559 align:start position:0%
it out in january
 
00:24:49.029 --> 00:24:49.039 align:start position:0%
but if if we're if you weren't to be
 
00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:50.720 align:start position:0%
happy with what we come up with
 
00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:52.240 align:start position:0%
you have every opportunity to put in
 
00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
your own bills but to say that we're
 
00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
putting them
 
00:24:58.310 --> 00:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
black tiny women above banking is no
 
00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:00.640 align:start position:0%
you're putting them actually below them
 
00:25:02.549 --> 00:25:02.559 align:start position:0%
so you have a lot of evidence that
 
00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
employers are doing this
 
00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
that then i'm telling you that 25 of
 
00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:07.590 align:start position:0%
that then i'm telling you that 25 of
women

00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
women
 
00:25:10.549 --> 00:25:10.559 align:start position:0%
currently are unprotected by the federal
 
00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:12.640 align:start position:0%
lactating bills because of the size of
 
00:25:13.669 --> 00:25:13.679 align:start position:0%
the business
 
00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
that's what this attempts to address 69.
 
00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
so the question we had was the the only
 
00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
time the only antidote story we ever got
 
00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
was actually
 
00:25:26.149 --> 00:25:26.159 align:start position:0%
the state agency and so so
 
00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
i mean are you saying that a lot of
 
00:25:29.669 --> 00:25:29.679 align:start position:0%
employers are not not
 
00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
taking care of their employees why
 
00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't we
 
00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:36.400 align:start position:0%
protect wouldn't we well something
 
00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:37.269 align:start position:0%
protect wouldn't we well something
because

00:25:37.269 --> 00:25:37.279 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:40.240 align:start position:0%
we again statutes are for one another no
 
00:25:41.029 --> 00:25:41.039 align:start position:0%
there's a problem
 
00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
we should fix but we also how much how
 
00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:44.789 align:start position:0%
we should fix but we also how much how
much

00:25:44.789 --> 00:25:44.799 align:start position:0%
much
 
00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:46.240 align:start position:0%
evidence do you have that there's really
 
00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
a problem up there that employers really
 
00:25:51.909 --> 00:25:51.919 align:start position:0%
are not taking care of their employees
 
00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure i follow mr chair i think
 
00:25:59.029 --> 00:25:59.039 align:start position:0%
we do a lot of statute to protect people
 
00:26:01.669 --> 00:26:01.679 align:start position:0%
proactively exactly to make sure that
 
00:26:02.549 --> 00:26:02.559 align:start position:0%
they don't have
 
00:26:05.029 --> 00:26:05.039 align:start position:0%
you know what you're asking women to do
 
00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
is if they do have a problem
 
00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:10.480 align:start position:0%
they have to go to uh the
 
00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
governor's council or the uh
 
00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
the state council so it goes back to
 
00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
case by case this is proactive it says
 
00:26:21.669 --> 00:26:21.679 align:start position:0%
no we as a legislature as a state we
 
00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
respect the right of women
 
00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
to have a medical condition known as
 
00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:28.789 align:start position:0%
to have a medical condition known as
pregnancy

00:26:28.789 --> 00:26:28.799 align:start position:0%
pregnancy
 
00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
or a medical condition known as needing
 
00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
to breastfeed my child
 
00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
we respect that and we don't want them
 
00:26:38.950 --> 00:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
to have to go and do
 
00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:41.440 align:start position:0%
uh go through appeals but there's also a
 
00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:42.549 align:start position:0%
uh go through appeals but there's also a
process

00:26:42.549 --> 00:26:42.559 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:26:45.269 --> 00:26:45.279 align:start position:0%
i mean this is going forward this is to
 
00:26:46.870 --> 00:26:46.880 align:start position:0%
prevent them from having to go to court
 
00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:47.269 align:start position:0%
prevent them from having to go to court
because

00:26:47.269 --> 00:26:47.279 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:26:49.909 --> 00:26:49.919 align:start position:0%
human rights commission is um has
 
00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:51.760 align:start position:0%
experience with the issues with the
 
00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
businesses they work as mediators
 
00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
they've got the experience and this is
 
00:26:58.070 --> 00:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
to put that into stature
 
00:26:59.669 --> 00:26:59.679 align:start position:0%
and again no opposition from the
 
00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:02.480 align:start position:0%
business community
 
00:27:04.789 --> 00:27:04.799 align:start position:0%
they were on board like you said just
 
00:27:06.149 --> 00:27:06.159 align:start position:0%
like my new members of
 
00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
i mean maybe the senate is prepared not
 
00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:15.669 align:start position:0%
i mean maybe the senate is prepared not
to

00:27:15.669 --> 00:27:15.679 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:27:18.190 --> 00:27:18.200 align:start position:0%
proceed to the banking that's your
 
00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:19.510 align:start position:0%
proceed to the banking that's your
choice

00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
choice
 
00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
unfortunate because as you know senator
 
00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
d'alessandro and i have led the
 
00:27:26.870 --> 00:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
charge on updating our trust laws so i
 
00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:28.870 align:start position:0%
charge on updating our trust laws so i
mean

00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
mean
 
00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
i don't like to be put in this position
 
00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
but you're using process
 
00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:36.720 align:start position:0%
to undermine protection for
 
00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:38.640 align:start position:0%
pregnant women and breastfeeding women
 
00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:39.750 align:start position:0%
pregnant women and breastfeeding women
and

00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:27:42.389 --> 00:27:42.399 align:start position:0%
i think you know i would suspect i speak
 
00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:44.720 align:start position:0%
for all three of us and all 24 of us
 
00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:45.350 align:start position:0%
for all three of us and all 24 of us
that

00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:45.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:57.909 --> 00:27:57.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:01.200 align:start position:0%
69 again no opposition
 
00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:04.640 align:start position:0%
it's been broadly vetted
 
00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
so both chambers and we're here to help
 
00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:08.640 align:start position:0%
the people of new hampshire
 
00:28:10.389 --> 00:28:10.399 align:start position:0%
i mean that's part of our process and we
 
00:28:13.029 --> 00:28:13.039 align:start position:0%
get criticized when this kind of
 
00:28:16.549 --> 00:28:16.559 align:start position:0%
of an impasse comes and you're
 
00:28:20.149 --> 00:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
making it really difficult for us to
 
00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:22.240 align:start position:0%
meet needs that are there i think it's
 
00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
weird that you guys are using the word
 
00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:24.070 align:start position:0%
weird that you guys are using the word
process

00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:26.960 align:start position:0%
because we don't like in general we
 
00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
this is the intent of this these bills
 
00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
are really important to the women
 
00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire and you want to stand
 
00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
in the way no
 
00:28:45.669 --> 00:28:45.679 align:start position:0%
women i i think most women are having
 
00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
able to work it out with their employer
 
00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:49.200 align:start position:0%
we don't there's not a there's not about
 
00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:50.240 align:start position:0%
money it's not about
 
00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:53.350 align:start position:0%
money it's not about
that

00:28:53.350 --> 00:28:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:55.909 --> 00:28:55.919 align:start position:0%
there's only one moment yet we've got
 
00:28:56.710 --> 00:28:56.720 align:start position:0%
the story
 
00:28:58.710 --> 00:28:58.720 align:start position:0%
mr chairman there are people shaking
 
00:29:00.549 --> 00:29:00.559 align:start position:0%
their heads over here
 
00:29:03.029 --> 00:29:03.039 align:start position:0%
women again actually when we get in that
 
00:29:05.029 --> 00:29:05.039 align:start position:0%
subcommittee when we retain the bill
 
00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:07.200 align:start position:0%
this september we'll get they'll need to
 
00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:08.720 align:start position:0%
bring forward that evidence
 
00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:22.630 --> 00:29:22.640 align:start position:0%
it's usually you guys have the time you
 
00:29:25.029 --> 00:29:25.039 align:start position:0%
have no time well i'm on hb2
 
00:29:28.389 --> 00:29:28.399 align:start position:0%
so my time is pretty short too
 
00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:30.880 align:start position:0%
okay i think this is important because
 
00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:31.990 align:start position:0%
okay i think this is important because
again

00:29:31.990 --> 00:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:29:34.870 --> 00:29:34.880 align:start position:0%
you're using process against protections
 
00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:35.540 align:start position:0%
you're using process against protections
for

00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:35.550 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:29:35.550 --> 00:29:38.149 align:start position:0%
for
[Music]

00:29:38.149 --> 00:29:38.159 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
you know pregnant women are
 
00:29:41.669 --> 00:29:41.679 align:start position:0%
breastfeeding right
 
00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
i can assure you that that uh yeah yes
 
00:29:47.029 --> 00:29:47.039 align:start position:0%
you would be kissing the healing process
 
00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
but that there was a majority of my
 
00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:51.360 align:start position:0%
committee you know that was ready to
 
00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
kill these girls
 
00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:55.200 align:start position:0%
and i convince them that let's keep them
 
00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:56.320 align:start position:0%
and work on
 
00:29:58.070 --> 00:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
so you understand you're preaching to
 
00:29:59.750 --> 00:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
the choir somewhat to me
 
00:30:01.350 --> 00:30:01.360 align:start position:0%
when you're saying this you know we need
 
00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
to you know we need to do this
 
00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:05.120 align:start position:0%
and i'm saying is i i certainly am
 
00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:06.149 align:start position:0%
and i'm saying is i i certainly am
sympathetic

00:30:06.149 --> 00:30:06.159 align:start position:0%
sympathetic
 
00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:07.440 align:start position:0%
it's not like this is the first time
 
00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
i've seen these shoes um i think
 
00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:12.480 align:start position:0%
it's probably it's commerce i think i've
 
00:30:14.149 --> 00:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
had this three or four times
 
00:30:17.510 --> 00:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
so i just uh it's okay isn't it time
 
00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:19.760 align:start position:0%
i i can speak to some of the evidence so
 
00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:34.789 --> 00:30:34.799 align:start position:0%
so the language of senegal 69 is the
 
00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:37.360 align:start position:0%
result of three and a half years of an
 
00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
uh advisory committee that was
 
00:30:41.029 --> 00:30:41.039 align:start position:0%
established in previous legislation
 
00:30:43.669 --> 00:30:43.679 align:start position:0%
that was passed and so we were charged
 
00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
with coming up with language for this
 
00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
and we did just what we were charged to
 
00:30:50.549 --> 00:30:50.559 align:start position:0%
do in that council and it was to work
 
00:30:50.559 --> 00:30:51.510 align:start position:0%
do in that council and it was to work
collaborating

00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:51.520 align:start position:0%
collaborating
 
00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:53.360 align:start position:0%
collaboratively with stakeholders and we
 
00:30:55.510 --> 00:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
did that and the evidence
 
00:30:57.830 --> 00:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
is in new hampshire eight out of ten
 
00:30:59.269 --> 00:30:59.279 align:start position:0%
moms initiate breastfeeding in the
 
00:30:59.279 --> 00:30:59.909 align:start position:0%
moms initiate breastfeeding in the
hospital

00:30:59.909 --> 00:30:59.919 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
that's incredible but only three of them
 
00:31:05.269 --> 00:31:05.279 align:start position:0%
are still breastfeeding fully at six
 
00:31:06.389 --> 00:31:06.399 align:start position:0%
months and we know
 
00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:08.720 align:start position:0%
one of the barriers is returning to work
 
00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
and so maybe
 
00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:12.320 align:start position:0%
you don't hear about the stories but
 
00:31:14.549 --> 00:31:14.559 align:start position:0%
that's because moms don't have time
 
00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
to file a complaint their bill
 
00:31:20.149 --> 00:31:20.159 align:start position:0%
will dry up in a couple days and so
 
00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:21.440 align:start position:0%
they're done
 
00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
and for many of them they need their
 
00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
jobs so they have to choose their job
 
00:31:26.789 --> 00:31:26.799 align:start position:0%
and so they keep working and then they
 
00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
use an alternative sports computer
 
00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:30.720 align:start position:0%
but it's unfortunate that they have to
 
00:31:32.549 --> 00:31:32.559 align:start position:0%
make that decision
 
00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:35.200 align:start position:0%
so we get calls i've worked at the
 
00:31:36.149 --> 00:31:36.159 align:start position:0%
department of health
 
00:31:37.909 --> 00:31:37.919 align:start position:0%
i'm a lactation consultant so if you
 
00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:39.440 align:start position:0%
google breastfeeding health you will
 
00:31:40.710 --> 00:31:40.720 align:start position:0%
find my name
 
00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
and so i get the calls while it's not my
 
00:31:43.990 --> 00:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
duty to
 
00:31:45.669 --> 00:31:45.679 align:start position:0%
support them in their legal efforts for
 
00:31:47.830 --> 00:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
returning to work we do offer them
 
00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:48.549 align:start position:0%
returning to work we do offer them
education

00:31:48.549 --> 00:31:48.559 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
and you know support and where to go to
 
00:31:52.789 --> 00:31:52.799 align:start position:0%
get help and so
 
00:31:55.269 --> 00:31:55.279 align:start position:0%
it's happening the calls come in
 
00:31:56.710 --> 00:31:56.720 align:start position:0%
employers call me
 
00:31:59.430 --> 00:31:59.440 align:start position:0%
hr staff help me what is appropriate
 
00:32:01.029 --> 00:32:01.039 align:start position:0%
what do i need to do
 
00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:03.200 align:start position:0%
we help them we have tool kits available
 
00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:04.950 align:start position:0%
we help them we have tool kits available
so

00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:04.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
i realize maybe you're not hearing the
 
00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:09.200 align:start position:0%
stories but for those of us
 
00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:11.360 align:start position:0%
working in this field the last 10 20
 
00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
hopefully we'll get through this in
 
00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
september and october
 
00:32:23.269 --> 00:32:23.279 align:start position:0%
take these bills out appreciate it our
 
00:32:24.789 --> 00:32:24.799 align:start position:0%
moms need the protection
 
00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
um what's the plan for the senate next
 
00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
year with comedy plus
 
00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of resistance building in
 
00:32:47.110 --> 00:32:47.120 align:start position:0%
the house towards
 
00:32:48.549 --> 00:32:48.559 align:start position:0%
bills that have lots of different
 
00:32:50.789 --> 00:32:50.799 align:start position:0%
subjects in them it's kind of out of the
 
00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:52.720 align:start position:0%
ordinary but
 
00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:54.480 align:start position:0%
can we speak to the process next year
 
00:32:57.430 --> 00:32:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:00.549 --> 00:33:00.559 align:start position:0%
so let me just say this um you know
 
00:33:04.630 --> 00:33:04.640 align:start position:0%
when the legislature reconvened in
 
00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:05.830 align:start position:0%
when the legislature reconvened in
december

00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
december
 
00:33:09.029 --> 00:33:09.039 align:start position:0%
we were facing 300 bills
 
00:33:12.789 --> 00:33:12.799 align:start position:0%
24 members uncertain housing was going
 
00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
to work
 
00:33:16.789 --> 00:33:16.799 align:start position:0%
for all the processes we had all the
 
00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
public hearings that we had to get
 
00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:21.190 align:start position:0%
public hearings that we had to get
through

00:33:21.190 --> 00:33:21.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:25.120 align:start position:0%
i regret that all of you
 
00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:28.240 align:start position:0%
found that process offensive
 
00:33:31.909 --> 00:33:31.919 align:start position:0%
but we were trying to protect our staff
 
00:33:34.789 --> 00:33:34.799 align:start position:0%
utilize the best ability that we could
 
00:33:36.149 --> 00:33:36.159 align:start position:0%
the technology
 
00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:38.320 align:start position:0%
to get through the unprecedented
 
00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:39.590 align:start position:0%
to get through the unprecedented
workload

00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
workload
 
00:33:42.549 --> 00:33:42.559 align:start position:0%
that you had to get through we got
 
00:33:43.509 --> 00:33:43.519 align:start position:0%
through it
 
00:33:47.029 --> 00:33:47.039 align:start position:0%
um if we had had 300 bills
 
00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
you would have even more problems than
 
00:33:51.669 --> 00:33:51.679 align:start position:0%
you had with obviously
 
00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
i think it's safe to say as a majority
 
00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:54.950 align:start position:0%
i think it's safe to say as a majority
leader

00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
leader
 
00:33:58.950 --> 00:33:58.960 align:start position:0%
in the house that the pandemic's over
 
00:34:02.389 --> 00:34:02.399 align:start position:0%
less blessings for that hopefully it
 
00:34:02.399 --> 00:34:02.950 align:start position:0%
less blessings for that hopefully it
never

00:34:02.950 --> 00:34:02.960 align:start position:0%
never
 
00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
returns again and we never have to use
 
00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:06.470 align:start position:0%
returns again and we never have to use
zoom

00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
zoom
 
00:34:08.869 --> 00:34:08.879 align:start position:0%
for the process again omnibus bills
 
00:34:10.470 --> 00:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
would be a thing of the past
 
00:34:17.990 --> 00:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:19.349 --> 00:34:19.359 align:start position:0%
and then the other last one the
 
00:34:21.190 --> 00:34:21.200 align:start position:0%
workforce housing one again
 
00:34:25.990 --> 00:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:29.349 --> 00:34:29.359 align:start position:0%
commerce bill which gets to the idea
 
00:34:29.359 --> 00:34:29.829 align:start position:0%
commerce bill which gets to the idea
that

00:34:29.829 --> 00:34:29.839 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:34:38.470 --> 00:34:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:42.069 --> 00:34:42.079 align:start position:0%
so again on this bill there was broad
 
00:34:43.510 --> 00:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
support for it
 
00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
in the hearing process yes it was an
 
00:34:48.149 --> 00:34:48.159 align:start position:0%
omnibus build
 
00:34:50.869 --> 00:34:50.879 align:start position:0%
as i vindicated to representative ammon
 
00:34:50.879 --> 00:34:51.270 align:start position:0%
as i vindicated to representative ammon
the

00:34:51.270 --> 00:34:51.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:53.200 align:start position:0%
whole purpose of that was to be able to
 
00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:54.560 align:start position:0%
conduct hearings
 
00:34:57.829 --> 00:34:57.839 align:start position:0%
in an orderly fashion it was supported
 
00:34:57.839 --> 00:34:59.030 align:start position:0%
in an orderly fashion it was supported
by

00:34:59.030 --> 00:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
the municipal association it was
 
00:35:03.589 --> 00:35:03.599 align:start position:0%
supported by the association of
 
00:35:03.599 --> 00:35:06.950 align:start position:0%
supported by the association of
realtors

00:35:06.950 --> 00:35:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
there was no opposition to the bill
 
00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:12.240 align:start position:0%
once that was supported by housing
 
00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:16.720 align:start position:0%
action new hampshire um
 
00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:18.560 align:start position:0%
you know just a quote from melissa
 
00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
martial who
 
00:35:23.349 --> 00:35:23.359 align:start position:0%
chairs housing action new hampshire um
 
00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
and represents ap organizations this was
 
00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
a program that had been unfortunately
 
00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:34.069 align:start position:0%
a program that had been unfortunately
repealed

00:35:34.069 --> 00:35:34.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:37.349 --> 00:35:37.359 align:start position:0%
and i believe it was the 2011
 
00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:40.720 align:start position:0%
budget we are
 
00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:44.800 align:start position:0%
short some 20 000 housing units
 
00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
it gives municipalities a better option
 
00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:51.440 align:start position:0%
you know in how they deal with
 
00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
conservation planning
 
00:35:57.270 --> 00:35:57.280 align:start position:0%
zoning funding for it it just puts the
 
00:35:58.870 --> 00:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
initiative back on the court
 
00:36:02.470 --> 00:36:02.480 align:start position:0%
so i see that i believe
 
00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:10.310 --> 00:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
so maybe you entertain a minute or two a
 
00:36:24.829 --> 00:36:24.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:24.839 --> 00:36:28.950 align:start position:0%
 
man

00:36:28.950 --> 00:36:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:32.320 align:start position:0%
hi everyone uh so
 
00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
uh this bill senate bill 86 part two
 
00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
originally was
 
00:36:37.990 --> 00:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
it's basically the number one priority
 
00:36:39.910 --> 00:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
of housing advocates this year as
 
00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
senator bradley ultimately stated you
 
00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
know we have a housing shortage of about
 
00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:45.280 align:start position:0%
20 thousand units across the
 
00:36:47.589 --> 00:36:47.599 align:start position:0%
state i think we all know that um
 
00:36:48.310 --> 00:36:48.320 align:start position:0%
housing is
 
00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
urgent in order for us to have our next
 
00:36:51.990 --> 00:36:52.000 align:start position:0%
generation here to keep our economy
 
00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.349 align:start position:0%
generation here to keep our economy
thriving

00:36:53.349 --> 00:36:53.359 align:start position:0%
thriving
 
00:36:55.510 --> 00:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
you know we need people to take over our
 
00:36:56.950 --> 00:36:56.960 align:start position:0%
dental practices our accounting
 
00:36:58.150 --> 00:36:58.160 align:start position:0%
practices our
 
00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
civic boards you know everything that
 
00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:02.240 align:start position:0%
keeps main street new hampshire
 
00:37:03.750 --> 00:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
functioning depends on us
 
00:37:05.510 --> 00:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
keeping up with housing and making sure
 
00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:07.200 align:start position:0%
that young people are here so
 
00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:10.240 align:start position:0%
this program is completely optional it's
 
00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
something that municipalities can apply
 
00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
for it's to support them
 
00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:15.680 align:start position:0%
there's no budget asked for it this year
 
00:37:17.670 --> 00:37:17.680 align:start position:0%
so it's really just the language backing
 
00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:18.470 align:start position:0%
so it's really just the language backing
statute

00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:21.680 align:start position:0%
has no impact on costs so
 
00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
my hope is that given that it's
 
00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
completely optional for our towns and
 
00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:26.310 align:start position:0%
completely optional for our towns and
cities

00:37:26.310 --> 00:37:26.320 align:start position:0%
cities
 
00:37:29.109 --> 00:37:29.119 align:start position:0%
and that um there's no fiscal impact
 
00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:30.640 align:start position:0%
from it that this is something we can
 
00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:31.349 align:start position:0%
from it that this is something we can
just

00:37:31.349 --> 00:37:31.359 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:37:33.109 --> 00:37:33.119 align:start position:0%
put back into operation and in future
 
00:37:34.870 --> 00:37:34.880 align:start position:0%
years then it's ready if
 
00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:47.750 align:start position:0%
years then it's ready if
we're

00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:49.040 align:start position:0%
and i know you want to have your
 
00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
hearings and you want to have a process
 
00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:53.200 align:start position:0%
so sometimes we run into in the court
 
00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:54.790 align:start position:0%
so sometimes we run into in the court
system

00:37:54.790 --> 00:37:54.800 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:37:56.470 --> 00:37:56.480 align:start position:0%
things aren't working out the laws just
 
00:37:58.310 --> 00:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
don't take care of what's so the court
 
00:37:59.349 --> 00:37:59.359 align:start position:0%
looks to equity
 
00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
to do the right thing sometimes you have
 
00:38:02.470 --> 00:38:02.480 align:start position:0%
to put the process
 
00:38:05.190 --> 00:38:05.200 align:start position:0%
aside and i just can't see especially in
 
00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
29 and 30 those two sections the sp 6968
 
00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:12.800 align:start position:0%
the equitable thing to do is just go
 
00:38:13.589 --> 00:38:13.599 align:start position:0%
maybe we didn't
 
00:38:15.670 --> 00:38:15.680 align:start position:0%
it's a it's an odd year we had a kobe d
 
00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
or you couldn't get your hearings in but
 
00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
they need the solution now
 
00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:24.640 align:start position:0%
so could you not put the process aside
 
00:38:25.990 --> 00:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
and err on the side of what's right for
 
00:38:27.829 --> 00:38:27.839 align:start position:0%
women on these two
 
00:38:29.910 --> 00:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
the bills are not dead no no they're not
 
00:38:32.069 --> 00:38:32.079 align:start position:0%
tempted it would be another year
 
00:38:33.670 --> 00:38:33.680 align:start position:0%
she needs the thing now that women are
 
00:38:35.829 --> 00:38:35.839 align:start position:0%
calling now if they're not getting
 
00:38:37.349 --> 00:38:37.359 align:start position:0%
their needs money i need to do the right
 
00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:39.200 align:start position:0%
thing for the people
 
00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
if it wasn't for cole but you would have
 
00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:42.640 align:start position:0%
got your hearing said
 
00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
so i would have had myself today you
 
00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:46.720 align:start position:0%
would have yourself
 
00:38:48.390 --> 00:38:48.400 align:start position:0%
so we couldn't do the process correct
 
00:38:50.390 --> 00:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
members alone but just like report it
 
00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:51.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't always have the
 
00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:53.440 align:start position:0%
law on their side they can go to equity
 
00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
and do the right thing so i'm asking you
 
00:38:56.470 --> 00:38:56.480 align:start position:0%
to try to do the right thing and
 
00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:04.480 align:start position:0%
i think the women of new hampshire might
 
00:39:06.470 --> 00:39:06.480 align:start position:0%
like to do that as well as the chair if
 
00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
you don't act on this
 
00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:09.680 align:start position:0%
this is not one year delay this is two
 
00:39:12.150 --> 00:39:12.160 align:start position:0%
years away this was one of the last
 
00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:20.390 align:start position:0%
years away this was one of the last
years

00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
you know i have to agree with my chair
 
00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:24.069 align:start position:0%
you know i have to agree with my chair
that

00:39:24.069 --> 00:39:24.079 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:39:27.430 --> 00:39:27.440 align:start position:0%
we're holding up what is completely
 
00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:30.400 align:start position:0%
in a critical part of our policy that we
 
00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:32.800 align:start position:0%
make as legislators
 
00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
because you couldn't have subcommittee
 
00:39:36.390 --> 00:39:36.400 align:start position:0%
it's not that it's wrong it's not that
 
00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:38.480 align:start position:0%
it's bad it's not that
 
00:39:40.390 --> 00:39:40.400 align:start position:0%
if it needs to be fixed you can actually
 
00:39:44.550 --> 00:39:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:51.270 --> 00:39:51.280 align:start position:0%
right we'll figure out the right way
 
00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:53.920 align:start position:0%
in the meantime it was because you were
 
00:39:54.630 --> 00:39:54.640 align:start position:0%
and we can
 
00:39:57.349 --> 00:39:57.359 align:start position:0%
you're in charge well and we can come
 
00:39:58.230 --> 00:39:58.240 align:start position:0%
back and
 
00:39:59.750 --> 00:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
change it if you need to change it but
 
00:40:01.349 --> 00:40:01.359 align:start position:0%
right now the people of new hampshire
 
00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:02.480 align:start position:0%
are asking us
 
00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
to do it we've you know we've had lots
 
00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:06.800 align:start position:0%
of testimony on it we've had
 
00:40:09.030 --> 00:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
many people sign in as well there's
 
00:40:10.470 --> 00:40:10.480 align:start position:0%
plenty of interest in this
 
00:40:12.390 --> 00:40:12.400 align:start position:0%
and we are criticized when we don't
 
00:40:13.589 --> 00:40:13.599 align:start position:0%
listen to the people
 
00:40:15.910 --> 00:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
and this is these are two bills that we
 
00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
can listen
 
00:40:20.069 --> 00:40:20.079 align:start position:0%
to the people to be friendly and you
 
00:40:21.349 --> 00:40:21.359 align:start position:0%
still want to bring us in the house they
 
00:40:24.390 --> 00:40:24.400 align:start position:0%
can turn it off
 
00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
i would say the first time i heard the
 
00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:27.680 align:start position:0%
breast feeding issue
 
00:40:30.790 --> 00:40:30.800 align:start position:0%
it's gotta be over 10 years ago so
 
00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
there's been plenty of opportunity for
 
00:40:33.990 --> 00:40:34.000 align:start position:0%
and and it took you
 
00:40:35.750 --> 00:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
the democrats were in charge that they
 
00:40:38.069 --> 00:40:38.079 align:start position:0%
could have gotten it passed yeah
 
00:40:40.069 --> 00:40:40.079 align:start position:0%
but all i'm saying is that right now i
 
00:40:42.069 --> 00:40:42.079 align:start position:0%
have a republican committee that
 
00:40:43.910 --> 00:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
would very much like to spend a little
 
00:40:45.349 --> 00:40:45.359 align:start position:0%
time to make sure that
 
00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:48.160 align:start position:0%
they go through the words and ensure
 
00:40:48.790 --> 00:40:48.800 align:start position:0%
that it
 
00:40:52.150 --> 00:40:52.160 align:start position:0%
is in their minds um
 
00:40:54.630 --> 00:40:54.640 align:start position:0%
it being fair to the businesses well i
 
00:40:56.230 --> 00:40:56.240 align:start position:0%
don't think this is partisan although
 
00:40:57.430 --> 00:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
you obviously do
 
00:40:59.829 --> 00:40:59.839 align:start position:0%
i think this is about women this is
 
00:41:01.910 --> 00:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
about equal rights for women
 
00:41:04.950 --> 00:41:04.960 align:start position:0%
equity parity and by the way the time
 
00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:07.200 align:start position:0%
frame was started several years ago i
 
00:41:08.230 --> 00:41:08.240 align:start position:0%
believe it was by
 
00:41:11.990 --> 00:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
a majority republican uh body where they
 
00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
put in place the advisory council which
 
00:41:16.069 --> 00:41:16.079 align:start position:0%
is where this came from
 
00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
so let's be straight and honest with
 
00:41:20.630 --> 00:41:20.640 align:start position:0%
each other
 
00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:23.200 align:start position:0%
what's happening here is yet another
 
00:41:24.790 --> 00:41:24.800 align:start position:0%
year of delay
 
00:41:27.030 --> 00:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
as you said this has been going on for a
 
00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:28.069 align:start position:0%
as you said this has been going on for a
decade

00:41:28.069 --> 00:41:28.079 align:start position:0%
decade
 
00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
what's one more year one more year is
 
00:41:31.910 --> 00:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
equity denied for women
 
00:41:34.710 --> 00:41:34.720 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire that's what it is it's
 
00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:35.829 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire that's what it is it's
i

00:41:35.829 --> 00:41:35.839 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
i would say fundamentally that is your
 
00:41:39.430 --> 00:41:39.440 align:start position:0%
problem because when people when you say
 
00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:43.040 align:start position:0%
equity and parody okay it's not
 
00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:45.280 align:start position:0%
because men don't have this problem all
 
00:41:46.069 --> 00:41:46.079 align:start position:0%
right and i
 
00:41:48.470 --> 00:41:48.480 align:start position:0%
certainly respect the fact that we want
 
00:41:50.309 --> 00:41:50.319 align:start position:0%
to treat women
 
00:41:52.950 --> 00:41:52.960 align:start position:0%
but we have wives and we have spouses
 
00:41:54.309 --> 00:41:54.319 align:start position:0%
and we have foreigners
 
00:41:56.870 --> 00:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
so we do have this problem it may not be
 
00:41:58.470 --> 00:41:58.480 align:start position:0%
in our own bodies
 
00:42:13.349 --> 00:42:13.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
see how we can get to the right answer
 
00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:18.160 align:start position:0%
here but if the house decides to
 
00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:18.950 align:start position:0%
here but if the house decides to
non-concur

00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
non-concur
 
00:42:20.550 --> 00:42:20.560 align:start position:0%
they can make another decision but at
 
00:42:23.990 --> 00:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:26.640 align:start position:0%
no i i i'm not pulling the house
 
00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:29.430 align:start position:0%
no i i i'm not pulling the house
position

00:42:29.430 --> 00:42:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:32.790 --> 00:42:32.800 align:start position:0%
so if i can make a suggestion
 
00:42:35.589 --> 00:42:35.599 align:start position:0%
why don't we reconvene tomorrow morning
 
00:42:35.599 --> 00:42:36.150 align:start position:0%
why don't we reconvene tomorrow morning
you

00:42:36.150 --> 00:42:36.160 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
have an opportunity to think about all
 
00:42:41.510 --> 00:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:44.640 align:start position:0%
and come back to us hopefully you will
 
00:42:50.790 --> 00:42:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:54.150 --> 00:42:54.160 align:start position:0%
we're we're i think we want to go back
 
00:42:56.309 --> 00:42:56.319 align:start position:0%
to the university bill
 
00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:05.990 --> 00:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:10.069 --> 00:43:10.079 align:start position:0%
uh you know i i just i i i'm not gonna
 
00:43:12.870 --> 00:43:12.880 align:start position:0%
change my position so i don't know what
 
00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:14.640 align:start position:0%
the purpose of coming back tomorrow
 
00:43:15.910 --> 00:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to change my potential
 
00:43:17.430 --> 00:43:17.440 align:start position:0%
because you would have a chance to talk
 
00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
and your leadership
 
00:43:22.870 --> 00:43:22.880 align:start position:0%
talk to members of your committee
 
00:43:27.109 --> 00:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
i think all of the bills are ready to go
 
00:43:29.190 --> 00:43:29.200 align:start position:0%
technically they're fine i don't think
 
00:43:31.750 --> 00:43:31.760 align:start position:0%
they need any amendments on them
 
00:43:34.230 --> 00:43:34.240 align:start position:0%
i think what we're hearing is this is a
 
00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
process problem
 
00:43:37.829 --> 00:43:37.839 align:start position:0%
and i think what we're trying to say is
 
00:43:39.670 --> 00:43:39.680 align:start position:0%
we need protections for mental health
 
00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:40.470 align:start position:0%
we need protections for mental health
patients

00:43:40.470 --> 00:43:40.480 align:start position:0%
patients
 
00:43:43.109 --> 00:43:43.119 align:start position:0%
and we need protections for pregnant or
 
00:43:44.550 --> 00:43:44.560 align:start position:0%
breastfeeding women
 
00:43:48.550 --> 00:43:48.560 align:start position:0%
and i think those all
 
00:43:51.589 --> 00:43:51.599 align:start position:0%
should override the process issues
 
00:43:53.990 --> 00:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
i mean we did the best we could with
 
00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
omnibus bills
 
00:43:58.309 --> 00:43:58.319 align:start position:0%
to ensure the process was smooth
 
00:44:01.349 --> 00:44:01.359 align:start position:0%
you've had issues with zoom okay i get
 
00:44:01.359 --> 00:44:01.910 align:start position:0%
you've had issues with zoom okay i get
that

00:44:01.910 --> 00:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:04.720 align:start position:0%
but show me where there's a problem in
 
00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:06.720 align:start position:0%
any of those three builds
 
00:44:09.589 --> 00:44:09.599 align:start position:0%
i know i'm not as familiar i will admit
 
00:44:10.230 --> 00:44:10.240 align:start position:0%
with the
 
00:44:13.270 --> 00:44:13.280 align:start position:0%
atlanta conservation bill um i think uh
 
00:44:15.190 --> 00:44:15.200 align:start position:0%
senator perkins boca did a good job of
 
00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
defending it she was very articulate on
 
00:44:18.309 --> 00:44:18.319 align:start position:0%
the floor
 
00:44:21.829 --> 00:44:21.839 align:start position:0%
and we fully support but
 
00:44:23.589 --> 00:44:23.599 align:start position:0%
and knowing how important affordable
 
00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
housing is we ask your consideration on
 
00:44:26.950 --> 00:44:26.960 align:start position:0%
that too
 
00:44:30.069 --> 00:44:30.079 align:start position:0%
and you know we seem to be at an impasse
 
00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
i don't like it in the past but
 
00:44:35.349 --> 00:44:35.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:37.670 --> 00:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
i'm going now ask my other members of
 
00:44:38.950 --> 00:44:38.960 align:start position:0%
the committee do you guys
 
00:44:42.230 --> 00:44:42.240 align:start position:0%
receive room here
 
00:44:43.750 --> 00:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
there's another issue we're talking
 
00:44:46.630 --> 00:44:46.640 align:start position:0%
about politically sensitive topics right
 
00:44:49.829 --> 00:44:49.839 align:start position:0%
and it's uh those issues
 
00:44:52.150 --> 00:44:52.160 align:start position:0%
are good to raise money for a campaign
 
00:44:56.550 --> 00:44:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:59.589 --> 00:44:59.599 align:start position:0%
yes i mean i acknowledge that
 
00:45:02.069 --> 00:45:02.079 align:start position:0%
um but there's another position of not
 
00:45:03.910 --> 00:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
micromanaging managing
 
00:45:06.230 --> 00:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
to do the right thing that's that's
 
00:45:07.990 --> 00:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
another position
 
00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
where we're not we're not trying to
 
00:45:12.790 --> 00:45:12.800 align:start position:0%
solve problems with mandates
 
00:45:15.109 --> 00:45:15.119 align:start position:0%
but that you know having faith that
 
00:45:16.150 --> 00:45:16.160 align:start position:0%
society to work
 
00:45:28.390 --> 00:45:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:30.710 --> 00:45:30.720 align:start position:0%
either opposition or suggestions from
 
00:45:32.790 --> 00:45:32.800 align:start position:0%
the business community about how to
 
00:45:35.109 --> 00:45:35.119 align:start position:0%
you know either fix or approve or even
 
00:45:35.119 --> 00:45:35.990 align:start position:0%
you know either fix or approve or even
against

00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
against
 
00:45:39.109 --> 00:45:39.119 align:start position:0%
you know 68 69 and
 
00:45:42.309 --> 00:45:42.319 align:start position:0%
uh 59 the fact of the matter is
 
00:45:44.829 --> 00:45:44.839 align:start position:0%
we have no opposition not from the
 
00:45:44.839 --> 00:45:52.550 align:start position:0%
we have no opposition not from the
business

00:45:52.550 --> 00:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:54.880 align:start position:0%
i think that you know the protections
 
00:45:56.950 --> 00:45:56.960 align:start position:0%
offered for mental health patients
 
00:46:00.630 --> 00:46:00.640 align:start position:0%
and pregnant or breastfeeding
 
00:46:03.670 --> 00:46:03.680 align:start position:0%
moms are pretty darn
 
00:46:09.910 --> 00:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:12.309 --> 00:46:12.319 align:start position:0%
so in the committee i took the business
 
00:46:12.319 --> 00:46:12.950 align:start position:0%
so in the committee i took the business
side

00:46:12.950 --> 00:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
side
 
00:46:15.109 --> 00:46:15.119 align:start position:0%
and i played devil's advocate and i was
 
00:46:16.790 --> 00:46:16.800 align:start position:0%
the one who kept saying
 
00:46:18.309 --> 00:46:18.319 align:start position:0%
is this going to be an imposition on
 
00:46:19.829 --> 00:46:19.839 align:start position:0%
businesses and they kept
 
00:46:21.190 --> 00:46:21.200 align:start position:0%
assuring me and we went through every
 
00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
little detail of sufficient reasonable
 
00:46:25.510 --> 00:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
breaks so it depended on the size of the
 
00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:26.150 align:start position:0%
breaks so it depended on the size of the
business

00:46:26.150 --> 00:46:26.160 align:start position:0%
business
 
00:46:29.270 --> 00:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
and we left it as broad as possible to
 
00:46:31.030 --> 00:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
accommodate the employers
 
00:46:34.069 --> 00:46:34.079 align:start position:0%
and the employee so it sort of was
 
00:46:36.309 --> 00:46:36.319 align:start position:0%
vetted already in the senate hearing
 
00:46:39.829 --> 00:46:39.839 align:start position:0%
um i don't know if you read reports
 
00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
but these ideas came up and we we are
 
00:46:43.910 --> 00:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
not at all putting any restrictions on
 
00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:44.870 align:start position:0%
not at all putting any restrictions on
businesses

00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:46.480 align:start position:0%
everything was left to again i love
 
00:46:48.150 --> 00:46:48.160 align:start position:0%
those words they were the legal words i
 
00:46:48.950 --> 00:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
was looking for
 
00:46:51.670 --> 00:46:51.680 align:start position:0%
reasonable and sufficient to accommodate
 
00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
both the employer and the employee
 
00:46:57.670 --> 00:46:57.680 align:start position:0%
and just think it's the time
 
00:47:03.910 --> 00:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:17.829 --> 00:47:17.839 align:start position:0%
my problem with 68
 
00:47:22.069 --> 00:47:22.079 align:start position:0%
and 69 is defining
 
00:47:25.589 --> 00:47:25.599 align:start position:0%
visualness that bucket is so
 
00:47:29.030 --> 00:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
big that i think it needs more work to
 
00:47:30.150 --> 00:47:30.160 align:start position:0%
define that
 
00:47:33.670 --> 00:47:33.680 align:start position:0%
reasonableness so the reason we did it
 
00:47:34.710 --> 00:47:34.720 align:start position:0%
that way
 
00:47:36.630 --> 00:47:36.640 align:start position:0%
so i brought up a pizza place and sand
 
00:47:38.549 --> 00:47:38.559 align:start position:0%
down this because i was like this is
 
00:47:40.230 --> 00:47:40.240 align:start position:0%
this is not good it's going to restrict
 
00:47:42.390 --> 00:47:42.400 align:start position:0%
businesses too much i said what about my
 
00:47:43.670 --> 00:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
little shop and they don't have any
 
00:47:45.349 --> 00:47:45.359 align:start position:0%
separate rooms and stuff
 
00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:46.640 align:start position:0%
and so they're going to be able to work
 
00:47:48.150 --> 00:47:48.160 align:start position:0%
it out whatever works between them and
 
00:47:49.589 --> 00:47:49.599 align:start position:0%
their employee and then if they have a
 
00:47:49.599 --> 00:47:50.150 align:start position:0%
their employee and then if they have a
problem

00:47:50.150 --> 00:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:47:52.309 --> 00:47:52.319 align:start position:0%
they can go to the governor's commission
 
00:47:53.990 --> 00:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
but we're giving
 
00:47:56.390 --> 00:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
both sides the opportunity to try to
 
00:47:57.990 --> 00:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
work things out first so we're not
 
00:47:59.510 --> 00:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
putting the heavy-handed government in
 
00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:00.069 align:start position:0%
putting the heavy-handed government in
first

00:48:00.069 --> 00:48:00.079 align:start position:0%
first
 
00:48:01.430 --> 00:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
we're letting the employer and the
 
00:48:03.349 --> 00:48:03.359 align:start position:0%
employee try to work things out
 
00:48:04.950 --> 00:48:04.960 align:start position:0%
and then if they can't decide what's
 
00:48:06.790 --> 00:48:06.800 align:start position:0%
reasonable and again
 
00:48:08.230 --> 00:48:08.240 align:start position:0%
one building's different than the next
 
00:48:10.950 --> 00:48:10.960 align:start position:0%
so you can't have a one-size-fits-all
 
00:48:12.790 --> 00:48:12.800 align:start position:0%
that's why we use those general words i
 
00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:14.790 align:start position:0%
that's why we use those general words i
agree

00:48:14.790 --> 00:48:14.800 align:start position:0%
agree
 
00:48:18.829 --> 00:48:18.839 align:start position:0%
but there's there is some more
 
00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:22.640 align:start position:0%
wordsmithing that needs to be done
 
00:48:25.910 --> 00:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
to ensure that every situation just like
 
00:48:26.549 --> 00:48:26.559 align:start position:0%
you said
 
00:48:28.710 --> 00:48:28.720 align:start position:0%
from the small mom-and-pop to the large
 
00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:30.549 align:start position:0%
from the small mom-and-pop to the large
corporations

00:48:30.549 --> 00:48:30.559 align:start position:0%
corporations
 
00:48:34.069 --> 00:48:34.079 align:start position:0%
are covered correctly just that's
 
00:48:38.790 --> 00:48:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:42.710 --> 00:48:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:46.549 --> 00:48:46.559 align:start position:0%
okay the housing and planning commission
 
00:48:48.390 --> 00:48:48.400 align:start position:0%
are not against workforce i live in
 
00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:49.670 align:start position:0%
are not against workforce i live in
derry

00:48:49.670 --> 00:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
derry
 
00:48:52.470 --> 00:48:52.480 align:start position:0%
we got workforce housing londonderry
 
00:48:54.069 --> 00:48:54.079 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen london doesn't have
 
00:48:57.109 --> 00:48:57.119 align:start position:0%
salaries and
 
00:49:02.230 --> 00:49:02.240 align:start position:0%
our school system is suffering from
 
00:49:09.010 --> 00:49:09.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:09.020 --> 00:49:14.470 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:49:14.470 --> 00:49:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:18.950 --> 00:49:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:22.790 --> 00:49:22.800 align:start position:0%
it it is where medicine is going
 
00:49:26.069 --> 00:49:26.079 align:start position:0%
in every aspect of gastroenterology i
 
00:49:27.430 --> 00:49:27.440 align:start position:0%
started my practice
 
00:49:31.270 --> 00:49:31.280 align:start position:0%
10 years ago at requested for physicians
 
00:49:34.710 --> 00:49:34.720 align:start position:0%
the whole concept is collaborative care
 
00:49:36.549 --> 00:49:36.559 align:start position:0%
it means that it's much easier for a
 
00:49:38.150 --> 00:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
patient to get access
 
00:49:41.670 --> 00:49:41.680 align:start position:0%
it means that it's less expensive
 
00:49:44.790 --> 00:49:44.800 align:start position:0%
both on the system and for the carriers
 
00:49:47.990 --> 00:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
and it means that one psychiatrist
 
00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
or one gastroenterologist this isn't
 
00:49:52.549 --> 00:49:52.559 align:start position:0%
about gastroenterologists outside
 
00:49:55.670 --> 00:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
is able to see much larger patient
 
00:49:55.680 --> 00:49:56.630 align:start position:0%
is able to see much larger patient
population

00:49:56.630 --> 00:49:56.640 align:start position:0%
population
 
00:49:58.470 --> 00:49:58.480 align:start position:0%
because of the type of interaction
 
00:49:59.750 --> 00:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
they're having
 
00:50:03.190 --> 00:50:03.200 align:start position:0%
so collaborative care
 
00:50:05.910 --> 00:50:05.920 align:start position:0%
is a medical term it is a standard of
 
00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:06.470 align:start position:0%
is a medical term it is a standard of
practice

00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
practice
 
00:50:09.750 --> 00:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
in medicine it is not happening in
 
00:50:11.670 --> 00:50:11.680 align:start position:0%
psychiatry the way it needs to
 
00:50:13.589 --> 00:50:13.599 align:start position:0%
and that's part of the reason when you
 
00:50:15.109 --> 00:50:15.119 align:start position:0%
look at our 10-10 year
 
00:50:16.630 --> 00:50:16.640 align:start position:0%
mental health plan that's part of the
 
00:50:18.150 --> 00:50:18.160 align:start position:0%
reason why
 
00:50:20.950 --> 00:50:20.960 align:start position:0%
we don't have the services that we need
 
00:50:23.030 --> 00:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
to keep people out of the hospital
 
00:50:25.910 --> 00:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
on the front side that's possible i
 
00:50:27.589 --> 00:50:27.599 align:start position:0%
understand about collaborative care i go
 
00:50:29.030 --> 00:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
to dairy medical center
 
00:50:31.270 --> 00:50:31.280 align:start position:0%
that's great extremely collaborative
 
00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:32.150 align:start position:0%
that's great extremely collaborative
care

00:50:32.150 --> 00:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
care
 
00:50:36.309 --> 00:50:36.319 align:start position:0%
so some mental health therapy doesn't
 
00:50:38.309 --> 00:50:38.319 align:start position:0%
fix this problem
 
00:50:40.230 --> 00:50:40.240 align:start position:0%
i think that senator whitley would like
 
00:50:42.309 --> 00:50:42.319 align:start position:0%
to address this
 
00:50:45.030 --> 00:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
argument yeah yeah thanks thank you so i
 
00:50:45.750 --> 00:50:45.760 align:start position:0%
just wanted to
 
00:50:47.349 --> 00:50:47.359 align:start position:0%
address the concerns that you all raised
 
00:50:48.790 --> 00:50:48.800 align:start position:0%
because certainly we have
 
00:50:51.510 --> 00:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
thought through those and um so i wasn't
 
00:50:52.870 --> 00:50:52.880 align:start position:0%
sponsored this year but has been worked
 
00:50:54.069 --> 00:50:54.079 align:start position:0%
on by many other senators
 
00:50:56.710 --> 00:50:56.720 align:start position:0%
and certainly the senate committee put
 
00:50:59.109 --> 00:50:59.119 align:start position:0%
us through her pieces to talk about
 
00:51:01.750 --> 00:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
the concessions or the uh what what we
 
00:51:03.190 --> 00:51:03.200 align:start position:0%
have done to prevail to address the
 
00:51:03.990 --> 00:51:04.000 align:start position:0%
business of
 
00:51:06.230 --> 00:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
the community so on the definition of
 
00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:07.430 align:start position:0%
the community so on the definition of
reasonableness

00:51:07.430 --> 00:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
reasonableness
 
00:51:10.950 --> 00:51:10.960 align:start position:0%
the uh dhhs had actually heard from
 
00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:11.750 align:start position:0%
the uh dhhs had actually heard from
businesses

00:51:11.750 --> 00:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
00:51:13.589 --> 00:51:13.599 align:start position:0%
and the task force had heard from
 
00:51:14.950 --> 00:51:14.960 align:start position:0%
businesses that they wanted an
 
00:51:17.190 --> 00:51:17.200 align:start position:0%
actual definition of what was reasonable
 
00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
so that's why we actually defined
 
00:51:21.270 --> 00:51:21.280 align:start position:0%
in the bill what was reasonable and that
 
00:51:23.510 --> 00:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
was based on the biology of a lactating
 
00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:24.150 align:start position:0%
was based on the biology of a lactating
mother

00:51:24.150 --> 00:51:24.160 align:start position:0%
mother
 
00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
so that was something that was asked for
 
00:51:27.109 --> 00:51:27.119 align:start position:0%
businesses so they could have more
 
00:51:29.670 --> 00:51:29.680 align:start position:0%
clarity so i just i wanted to
 
00:51:31.670 --> 00:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
point that out and the other piece was
 
00:51:33.030 --> 00:51:33.040 align:start position:0%
certainly they wanted to make this a
 
00:51:34.630 --> 00:51:34.640 align:start position:0%
solution that worked for
 
00:51:36.549 --> 00:51:36.559 align:start position:0%
new hampshire businesses in the unique
 
00:51:38.870 --> 00:51:38.880 align:start position:0%
structure of new hampshire businesses so
 
00:51:40.710 --> 00:51:40.720 align:start position:0%
many other states and 36 other states
 
00:51:42.470 --> 00:51:42.480 align:start position:0%
have filled those gaps and have a
 
00:51:43.430 --> 00:51:43.440 align:start position:0%
similar law
 
00:51:45.589 --> 00:51:45.599 align:start position:0%
and they applied to all businesses but
 
00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
hearing from the business community we
 
00:51:48.069 --> 00:51:48.079 align:start position:0%
said okay
 
00:51:49.109 --> 00:51:49.119 align:start position:0%
that doesn't make sense for new
 
00:51:50.230 --> 00:51:50.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire we're going to raise that to
 
00:51:52.309 --> 00:51:52.319 align:start position:0%
the congressional so we did that for
 
00:51:54.790 --> 00:51:54.800 align:start position:0%
you know employers with six and above so
 
00:51:56.630 --> 00:51:56.640 align:start position:0%
you know i think that just goes to show
 
00:51:57.829 --> 00:51:57.839 align:start position:0%
that this bill has been worked and
 
00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
worked and worked and certainly this
 
00:52:03.109 --> 00:52:03.119 align:start position:0%
version of the bill reflects all of the
 
00:52:04.950 --> 00:52:04.960 align:start position:0%
concerns brought to us by the business
 
00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:06.150 align:start position:0%
concerns brought to us by the business
community

00:52:06.150 --> 00:52:06.160 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:52:08.069 --> 00:52:08.079 align:start position:0%
so i just wanted you to be confident
 
00:52:16.829 --> 00:52:16.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:16.839 --> 00:52:19.430 align:start position:0%
 
community

00:52:19.430 --> 00:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:52:24.309 --> 00:52:24.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:26.309 --> 00:52:26.319 align:start position:0%
that's why i suggested that we recess
 
00:52:28.630 --> 00:52:28.640 align:start position:0%
until tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock
 
00:52:38.069 --> 00:52:38.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:39.589 --> 00:52:39.599 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be nice if you got half a
 
00:52:41.829 --> 00:52:41.839 align:start position:0%
loaf rather than nothing
 
00:52:43.430 --> 00:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
coming out of today would you rather
 
00:52:45.109 --> 00:52:45.119 align:start position:0%
have nothing out for all these things
 
00:52:46.470 --> 00:52:46.480 align:start position:0%
and you should i thought when we came
 
00:52:48.630 --> 00:52:48.640 align:start position:0%
here we were open
 
00:52:50.470 --> 00:52:50.480 align:start position:0%
right weren't we open then no i was
 
00:52:52.630 --> 00:52:52.640 align:start position:0%
never i made a clear right yeah
 
00:52:54.950 --> 00:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
i'm here to have give you guys a chance
 
00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:55.750 align:start position:0%
i'm here to have give you guys a chance
to

00:52:55.750 --> 00:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:52:57.270 --> 00:52:57.280 align:start position:0%
express you know how important these
 
00:53:07.430 --> 00:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:10.549 --> 00:53:10.559 align:start position:0%
excuse me i think i'm representing three
 
00:53:13.190 --> 00:53:13.200 align:start position:0%
out of three people here
 
00:53:14.470 --> 00:53:14.480 align:start position:0%
they would like to say that they could
 
00:53:16.630 --> 00:53:16.640 align:start position:0%
say it's a good styles position
 
00:53:19.670 --> 00:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
this is the house position and that you
 
00:53:21.910 --> 00:53:21.920 align:start position:0%
know if it if it does it's unfortunate
 
00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:23.349 align:start position:0%
know if it if it does it's unfortunate
and

00:53:23.349 --> 00:53:23.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:53:24.950 --> 00:53:24.960 align:start position:0%
that but that was your choice to put
 
00:53:26.630 --> 00:53:26.640 align:start position:0%
these on you didn't come and
 
00:53:29.510 --> 00:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
say gene you know hunt how do you think
 
00:53:30.549 --> 00:53:30.559 align:start position:0%
your community is going to feel about it
 
00:53:32.150 --> 00:53:32.160 align:start position:0%
if you stick these bills back
 
00:53:35.270 --> 00:53:35.280 align:start position:0%
you know on this banking bill and i
 
00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:36.720 align:start position:0%
would have told you then
 
00:53:40.630 --> 00:53:40.640 align:start position:0%
that we're not tolerant
 
00:53:42.710 --> 00:53:42.720 align:start position:0%
of you know because then determined like
 
00:53:43.910 --> 00:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
an ominous bill but
 
00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
that's all there's congress though but
 
00:53:47.109 --> 00:53:47.119 align:start position:0%
no we yeah
 
00:53:50.549 --> 00:53:50.559 align:start position:0%
we we you know
 
00:53:53.670 --> 00:53:53.680 align:start position:0%
uh it's unfortunate um for the banking
 
00:53:55.109 --> 00:53:55.119 align:start position:0%
department not to have this bill
 
00:53:58.069 --> 00:53:58.079 align:start position:0%
uh 610 it does seem uh unfortunate you
 
00:53:58.079 --> 00:53:58.549 align:start position:0%
uh 610 it does seem uh unfortunate you
know

00:53:58.549 --> 00:53:58.559 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:54:00.710 --> 00:54:00.720 align:start position:0%
strange that that you guys chose this
 
00:54:02.790 --> 00:54:02.800 align:start position:0%
bill of all bills
 
00:54:04.870 --> 00:54:04.880 align:start position:0%
to to load it up with non-german
 
00:54:04.880 --> 00:54:07.109 align:start position:0%
to to load it up with non-german
amendments

00:54:07.109 --> 00:54:07.119 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
00:54:08.950 --> 00:54:08.960 align:start position:0%
and it seems unfortunate to us
 
00:54:10.950 --> 00:54:10.960 align:start position:0%
introducing process
 
00:54:13.510 --> 00:54:13.520 align:start position:0%
to underlying protections but here's
 
00:54:15.829 --> 00:54:15.839 align:start position:0%
what i'm going to suggest
 
00:54:18.230 --> 00:54:18.240 align:start position:0%
the way the process works now as you
 
00:54:19.910 --> 00:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
know mr chairman
 
00:54:22.950 --> 00:54:22.960 align:start position:0%
is that it's a household so you get the
 
00:54:25.270 --> 00:54:25.280 align:start position:0%
write to look forward
 
00:54:27.990 --> 00:54:28.000 align:start position:0%
you write the report any way you want we
 
00:54:29.510 --> 00:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
would ask that you put
 
00:54:32.230 --> 00:54:32.240 align:start position:0%
some or all of the four bills in that
 
00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:33.190 align:start position:0%
some or all of the four bills in that
report

00:54:33.190 --> 00:54:33.200 align:start position:0%
report
 
00:54:36.309 --> 00:54:36.319 align:start position:0%
then it will be our choice
 
00:54:40.700 --> 00:54:40.710 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:40.710 --> 00:54:47.990 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:54:47.990 --> 00:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:49.910 --> 00:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
i'm asking you to reconsider your
 
00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:51.030 align:start position:0%
i'm asking you to reconsider your
position

00:54:51.030 --> 00:54:51.040 align:start position:0%
position
 
00:54:54.710 --> 00:54:54.720 align:start position:0%
and put in one two three or four
 
00:54:56.789 --> 00:54:56.799 align:start position:0%
of those bills and then it will be our
 
00:54:59.109 --> 00:54:59.119 align:start position:0%
choice whether we sign it
 
00:55:02.470 --> 00:55:02.480 align:start position:0%
is that fair obviously yeah
 
00:55:10.150 --> 00:55:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:13.750 --> 00:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
uh last year 12 34 had 77.
 
00:55:17.030 --> 00:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
that was the last year two three four so
 
00:55:19.030 --> 00:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
we need to reverse that trend all right
 
00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:20.160 align:start position:0%
and you know what
 
00:55:22.470 --> 00:55:22.480 align:start position:0%
i i agree with your representatives but
 
00:55:23.589 --> 00:55:23.599 align:start position:0%
it makes it hard to
 
00:55:24.950 --> 00:55:24.960 align:start position:0%
parse out the different issues right
 
00:55:26.950 --> 00:55:26.960 align:start position:0%
because i think one case
 
00:55:28.870 --> 00:55:28.880 align:start position:0%
i think these four issues are pretty
 
00:55:31.109 --> 00:55:31.119 align:start position:0%
clear and it'd be one thing
 
00:55:32.470 --> 00:55:32.480 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't be here if there was
 
00:55:35.430 --> 00:55:35.440 align:start position:0%
significant opposition to any of them
 
00:55:38.710 --> 00:55:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:41.109 --> 00:55:41.119 align:start position:0%
so that's my suggestion if we're not
 
00:55:43.030 --> 00:55:43.040 align:start position:0%
going to meet tomorrow it's at your
 
00:55:44.630 --> 00:55:44.640 align:start position:0%
discretion as chair of the conference
 
00:55:46.789 --> 00:55:46.799 align:start position:0%
committee prepare the report
 
00:55:48.230 --> 00:55:48.240 align:start position:0%
in whatever way you're going to prepare
 
00:55:50.390 --> 00:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
the report maybe our choice whether we
 
00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:51.030 align:start position:0%
the report maybe our choice whether we
sign

00:55:51.030 --> 00:55:51.040 align:start position:0%
sign
 
00:55:52.950 --> 00:55:52.960 align:start position:0%
maybe senator morris's choice whether he
 
00:55:54.549 --> 00:55:54.559 align:start position:0%
replaces members
 
00:55:57.430 --> 00:55:57.440 align:start position:0%
if he deems that appropriate or it'll
 
00:55:57.440 --> 00:55:58.069 align:start position:0%
if he deems that appropriate or it'll
die

00:55:58.069 --> 00:55:58.079 align:start position:0%
die
 
00:56:01.190 --> 00:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
we don't know i'm pretty unhappy
 
00:56:03.589 --> 00:56:03.599 align:start position:0%
to tell you the truth at you know what
 
00:56:04.390 --> 00:56:04.400 align:start position:0%
i'm here
 
00:56:06.950 --> 00:56:06.960 align:start position:0%
i'm a lot more unhappy right now than i
 
00:56:09.109 --> 00:56:09.119 align:start position:0%
was when i walked in here at 10 o'clock
 
00:56:10.549 --> 00:56:10.559 align:start position:0%
the kind of arguments that have been
 
00:56:13.349 --> 00:56:13.359 align:start position:0%
used against killers pills so
 
00:56:16.430 --> 00:56:16.440 align:start position:0%
that's my suggestion
 
00:56:19.990 --> 00:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
6869 are not dead
 
00:56:21.829 --> 00:56:21.839 align:start position:0%
they're certainly not going anywhere
 
00:56:24.710 --> 00:56:24.720 align:start position:0%
right now mr chairman
 
00:56:26.549 --> 00:56:26.559 align:start position:0%
my notes here says that your interim
 
00:56:31.670 --> 00:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
study 638
 
00:56:35.030 --> 00:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
6 38 is it my ingredients correct
 
00:56:38.069 --> 00:56:38.079 align:start position:0%
that was last year oh that was flash
 
00:56:41.109 --> 00:56:41.119 align:start position:0%
cheer so this time
 
00:56:50.480 --> 00:56:50.490 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:50.490 --> 00:56:52.870 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:56:52.870 --> 00:56:52.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:56:55.750 --> 00:56:55.760 align:start position:0%
what happened to 638 638 when it came to
 
00:57:11.349 --> 00:57:11.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:14.870 --> 00:57:14.880 align:start position:0%
senate bill 638 challenged the new
 
00:57:16.870 --> 00:57:16.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire housing conservation planning
 
00:57:16.880 --> 00:57:17.430 align:start position:0%
hampshire housing conservation planning
program

00:57:17.430 --> 00:57:17.440 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:57:19.750 --> 00:57:19.760 align:start position:0%
right that was last year has the house
 
00:57:21.190 --> 00:57:21.200 align:start position:0%
ever heard this bill
 
00:57:33.109 --> 00:57:33.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:35.270 --> 00:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
i think the amendment stripped out the
 
00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:36.390 align:start position:0%
i think the amendment stripped out the
section

00:57:36.390 --> 00:57:36.400 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:57:39.270 --> 00:57:39.280 align:start position:0%
part two of so the house position is
 
00:57:40.870 --> 00:57:40.880 align:start position:0%
that they were not ready to pass this

bill that's correct and you're asking me
 
00:57:43.430 --> 00:57:43.440 align:start position:0%

00:57:45.670 --> 00:57:45.680 align:start position:0%
over mr disregard another client i'm
 
00:57:47.910 --> 00:57:47.920 align:start position:0%
asking you to reconsider
 
00:57:50.950 --> 00:57:50.960 align:start position:0%
your position of being opposed to
 
00:57:52.549 --> 00:57:52.559 align:start position:0%
all four of the bills we're not going to
 
00:57:54.230 --> 00:57:54.240 align:start position:0%
get everything this one's easy
 
00:57:57.270 --> 00:57:57.280 align:start position:0%

00:57:58.470 --> 00:57:58.480 align:start position:0%
chairman you're not going to give
 
00:58:01.270 --> 00:58:01.280 align:start position:0%
us everything we want we're asking you
 
00:58:02.230 --> 00:58:02.240 align:start position:0%
in particular
 
00:58:04.230 --> 00:58:04.240 align:start position:0%
in the middle of a mental health crisis
 
00:58:06.309 --> 00:58:06.319 align:start position:0%
and when pregnant or lactating mothers
 
00:58:07.349 --> 00:58:07.359 align:start position:0%
need protection
 
00:58:10.390 --> 00:58:10.400 align:start position:0%
to at least reconsider your position on
 
00:58:11.349 --> 00:58:11.359 align:start position:0%
those bills
 
00:58:13.670 --> 00:58:13.680 align:start position:0%
and maybe at a time that we need more
 
00:58:15.190 --> 00:58:15.200 align:start position:0%
affordable housing
 
00:58:17.270 --> 00:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
um i don't think there are any members
 
00:58:19.430 --> 00:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
here from municipal county unless i'm
 
00:58:22.470 --> 00:58:22.480 align:start position:0%

sign off
 
02:03:59.189 --> 02:03:59.199 align:start position:0%

02:05:38.229 --> 02:05:38.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:08.810 --> 02:06:08.820 align:start position:0%

02:06:14.840 --> 02:06:28.830 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:06:28.830 --> 02:06:28.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:28.840 --> 02:06:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
uh

02:06:52.640 --> 02:06:52.650 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:52.650 --> 02:06:56.830 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:06:56.830 --> 02:06:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:56.840 --> 02:07:24.830 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:07:24.830 --> 02:07:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:24.840 --> 02:07:53.589 align:start position:0%
 
cheers

02:07:53.589 --> 02:07:53.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:54.870 --> 02:07:54.880 align:start position:0%
the center back of the broadened
 
02:07:54.880 --> 02:07:59.030 align:start position:0%
the center back of the broadened
amendment

02:07:59.030 --> 02:07:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:01.430 --> 02:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
did we want to take that before we get
 
02:08:03.030 --> 02:08:03.040 align:start position:0%
into intelligence
 
02:08:05.270 --> 02:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
well that's the that's what i was
 
02:08:07.830 --> 02:08:07.840 align:start position:0%
thinking about because
 
02:08:11.669 --> 02:08:11.679 align:start position:0%
this has got a significant change but
 
02:08:15.669 --> 02:08:15.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:17.750 --> 02:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
anything close to the house position
 
02:08:20.149 --> 02:08:20.159 align:start position:0%
which is a
 
02:08:34.950 --> 02:08:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:38.229 --> 02:08:38.239 align:start position:0%
that that's the health position and
 
02:08:40.069 --> 02:08:40.079 align:start position:0%
although you know nice to have
 
02:08:43.589 --> 02:08:43.599 align:start position:0%
constitutional language in this
 
02:08:47.750 --> 02:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
constitution i don't believe that's
 
02:08:53.589 --> 02:08:53.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:57.109 --> 02:08:57.119 align:start position:0%
moving toward what the house position is
 
02:09:00.390 --> 02:09:00.400 align:start position:0%
i mean the house has
 
02:09:04.149 --> 02:09:04.159 align:start position:0%
instead of acquiring a approval every
 
02:09:06.870 --> 02:09:06.880 align:start position:0%
every 30 days we've said okay the
 
02:09:08.950 --> 02:09:08.960 align:start position:0%
governor have 90 days
 
02:09:12.069 --> 02:09:12.079 align:start position:0%
before we have to vote this does not
 
02:09:14.550 --> 02:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
require both of the legislature at any
 
02:09:14.560 --> 02:09:15.109 align:start position:0%
require both of the legislature at any
point

02:09:15.109 --> 02:09:15.119 align:start position:0%
point
 
02:09:17.669 --> 02:09:17.679 align:start position:0%
just it just gives them the option which
 
02:09:18.950 --> 02:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
is already
 
02:09:22.229 --> 02:09:22.239 align:start position:0%
awesome it's a life it's nice it works
 
02:09:30.830 --> 02:09:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:30.840 --> 02:09:39.430 align:start position:0%
 
sense

02:09:39.430 --> 02:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:42.149 --> 02:09:42.159 align:start position:0%
i can't i mean the redress of grievances
 
02:09:43.030 --> 02:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
i mean i was here
 
02:09:46.069 --> 02:09:46.079 align:start position:0%
back in 2010 at
 
02:09:47.830 --> 02:09:47.840 align:start position:0%
you had a committee but i mean the
 
02:09:49.350 --> 02:09:49.360 align:start position:0%
senate would have to change their rules
 
02:09:50.870 --> 02:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
because we have no process for
 
02:09:52.790 --> 02:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
redressing grievances
 
02:09:54.790 --> 02:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
um so i don't even know how we didn't
 
02:09:56.310 --> 02:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
begin to
 
02:10:00.229 --> 02:10:00.239 align:start position:0%
formulate that um so i
 
02:10:02.229 --> 02:10:02.239 align:start position:0%
thank you for trying to think a little
 
02:10:04.229 --> 02:10:04.239 align:start position:0%
bit outside the box on this issue
 
02:10:04.239 --> 02:10:04.950 align:start position:0%
bit outside the box on this issue
senator

02:10:04.950 --> 02:10:04.960 align:start position:0%
senator
 
02:10:07.750 --> 02:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
but i just see this making what is
 
02:10:08.470 --> 02:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
already a
 
02:10:11.669 --> 02:10:11.679 align:start position:0%
complicated issue even more complicated
 
02:10:13.430 --> 02:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
and we wanted to try to be as
 
02:10:16.069 --> 02:10:16.079 align:start position:0%
transparent as possible
 
02:10:19.589 --> 02:10:19.599 align:start position:0%
with the public um so i just think that
 
02:10:21.350 --> 02:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
this makes it a little more complicated
 
02:10:28.629 --> 02:10:28.639 align:start position:0%
but thank you anyway
 
02:10:31.510 --> 02:10:31.520 align:start position:0%
that's what and this was intended to be
 
02:10:31.520 --> 02:10:33.510 align:start position:0%
that's what and this was intended to be
a

02:10:33.510 --> 02:10:33.520 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:10:36.629 --> 02:10:36.639 align:start position:0%
fix the obvious errors and the currents
 
02:10:38.550 --> 02:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
in the current statute which doesn't
 
02:10:38.560 --> 02:10:39.669 align:start position:0%
in the current statute which doesn't
allow

02:10:39.669 --> 02:10:39.679 align:start position:0%
allow
 
02:10:41.589 --> 02:10:41.599 align:start position:0%
individual emergency orders to be
 
02:10:43.270 --> 02:10:43.280 align:start position:0%
addressed and the
 
02:10:45.750 --> 02:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal issues and we've got the fiscal
 
02:10:46.709 --> 02:10:46.719 align:start position:0%
issues down
 
02:10:46.719 --> 02:10:49.330 align:start position:0%
issues down
that's

02:10:49.330 --> 02:10:49.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:49.340 --> 02:10:52.470 align:start position:0%

02:10:52.470 --> 02:10:52.480 align:start position:0%

02:11:07.109 --> 02:11:07.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:19.750 --> 02:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:22.149 --> 02:11:22.159 align:start position:0%
also it does certainly complicate things
 
02:11:22.870 --> 02:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
which is not
 
02:11:25.990 --> 02:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
awesome i just think that the compromise
 
02:11:27.270 --> 02:11:27.280 align:start position:0%
that regarding offers
 
02:11:36.830 --> 02:11:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:36.840 --> 02:11:51.669 align:start position:0%
 
by

02:11:51.669 --> 02:11:51.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:54.390 --> 02:11:54.400 align:start position:0%
but the rest of it is the same we just
 
02:11:55.510 --> 02:11:55.520 align:start position:0%
had to put everything
 
02:11:57.830 --> 02:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
into an amendment that's all yeah no no
 
02:11:58.870 --> 02:11:58.880 align:start position:0%
they uh
 
02:12:00.550 --> 02:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
it's got section two it's still it's the
 
02:12:03.990 --> 02:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:07.270 --> 02:12:07.280 align:start position:0%
yeah it's uh affected c
 
02:12:14.470 --> 02:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:17.030 --> 02:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
so if you would like to have a vote we
 
02:12:25.270 --> 02:12:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:25.280 --> 02:12:33.030 align:start position:0%

amendment in that case i'm going to move
 
02:12:36.709 --> 02:12:36.719 align:start position:0%
