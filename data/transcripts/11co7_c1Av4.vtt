1041 uh I do not know yet
 
00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:40.360 align:start position:0%
uh how many if any uh Senate bills will
 
00:08:42.709 --> 00:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
come to us last year I think we had just
 
00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
one or two um so I I can't tell you yet
 
00:08:49.389 --> 00:08:49.399 align:start position:0%
uh if we don't get any then uh this
 
00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:53.480 align:start position:0%
would be our last U our last session I I
 
00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:56.120 align:start position:0%
suspect there'll probably be uh a couple
 
00:08:58.230 --> 00:08:58.240 align:start position:0%
but I I do not know that
 
00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:01.880 align:start position:0%
yet okay at this time um we have the one
 
00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:05.800 align:start position:0%
measure which is uh house resolution 31
 
00:09:07.509 --> 00:09:07.519 align:start position:0%

repres man would you like to speak to
 
00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:42.560 align:start position:0%
your amendment to hr31 yeah so the
 
00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:44.680 align:start position:0%
language came from the the prime sponsor
 
00:09:46.509 --> 00:09:46.519 align:start position:0%
it was mostly the the entire amendment
 
00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:48.680 align:start position:0%
is uh replacing just the references to
 
00:09:50.389 --> 00:09:50.399 align:start position:0%
the the name of the act that this
 
00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:52.160 align:start position:0%
resolution is for it changes it to
 
00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:54.920 align:start position:0%
design patent term extension act from
 
00:09:56.590 --> 00:09:56.600 align:start position:0%
the dignity through Prosperity act
 
00:09:58.190 --> 00:09:58.200 align:start position:0%
because the actual name is the design
 
00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:12.600 align:start position:0%

a thank you re gagy um yes I don't

99h that has replaced the original Bill
 
00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:45.880 align:start position:0%
the other question I have Mr chairman is
 
00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:48.760 align:start position:0%
the fact that uh what the bill is asking
 
00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:51.720 align:start position:0%
us to do is to notify our Congressional
 
00:11:55.269 --> 00:11:55.279 align:start position:0%
uh delegation to support the design
 
00:11:57.269 --> 00:11:57.279 align:start position:0%
patent term extension act which is
 
00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:00.360 align:start position:0%

00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:03.160 align:start position:0%

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:07.000 align:start position:0%
the other P parts of the act that we
 
00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.269 align:start position:0%
the other P parts of the act that we
haven't

00:12:08.269 --> 00:12:08.279 align:start position:0%
haven't
 
00:12:09.949 --> 00:12:09.959 align:start position:0%

00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:11.800 align:start position:0%
representative sherff I honestly have
 
00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
not read the design patent term
 
00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:16.480 align:start position:0%
extension act it's uh as you mentioned
 
00:12:17.389 --> 00:12:17.399 align:start position:0%
is in
 
00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:22.680 align:start position:0%
Congress uh and again the the last on
 
00:12:26.949 --> 00:12:26.959 align:start position:0%
line 24 the last part of it does say it
 
00:12:31.189 --> 00:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
directs should this pass uh it we the
 
00:12:32.949 --> 00:12:32.959 align:start position:0%
resolution calls for Our House of
 
00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:34.880 align:start position:0%
Representatives to direct our federal
 
00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
delegation to actively support and
 
00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:39.880 align:start position:0%
advocate for the passage of the
 
00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
uh uh design patent term extension
 
00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
act so I have not uh honestly read that
 
00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:50.240 align:start position:0%
whole act I'm my focus our Focus was on
 
00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:52.040 align:start position:0%
the part of it to support representative
 
00:12:55.069 --> 00:12:55.079 align:start position:0%
Sweeny's constituent um what what what
 
00:12:57.550 --> 00:12:57.560 align:start position:0%
are your thoughts well I just point out
 
00:13:00.189 --> 00:13:00.199 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I I have
 
00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:01.880 align:start position:0%
all the faith in the world and
 
00:13:03.269 --> 00:13:03.279 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney and what he's
 
00:13:05.389 --> 00:13:05.399 align:start position:0%
presenting to this committee my only
 
00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:07.880 align:start position:0%
concern is if there be something is part
 
00:13:09.949 --> 00:13:09.959 align:start position:0%
of that act we're asking our delegation
 
00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
to support the entire bill that's coming
 
00:13:14.949 --> 00:13:14.959 align:start position:0%
before Congress and we don't know what
 
00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:16.720 align:start position:0%
else might be in there it could be
 
00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:18.680 align:start position:0%
something that uh would not be in the
 
00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
best interest of the New Hampshire house
 
00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:22.360 align:start position:0%
that is my only concern I wanted to
 
00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:24.160 align:start position:0%
bring it to the attention of the chair
 
00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:26.160 align:start position:0%
thank you representative I that's a good
 
00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:29.240 align:start position:0%
point and a fair concern uh my my
 
00:13:31.949 --> 00:13:31.959 align:start position:0%
response would be were this to pass and
 
00:13:34.189 --> 00:13:34.199 align:start position:0%
if there was something in the the
 
00:13:37.389 --> 00:13:37.399 align:start position:0%
federal act that's uh in consideration
 
00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
in Washington if if any members of our
 
00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:40.670 align:start position:0%
in Washington if if any members of our
federal

00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:40.680 align:start position:0%
federal
 
00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:43.800 align:start position:0%
delegation uh saw anything untour or
 
00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:45.240 align:start position:0%
something they could not support in the
 
00:13:48.069 --> 00:13:48.079 align:start position:0%
act and they uh obviously I would trust
 
00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
that they would uh vote the way they
 
00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:52.440 align:start position:0%
needed to vote and if they ended up
 
00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
voting against it then they vote against
 
00:13:59.110 --> 00:13:59.120 align:start position:0%
it yeah thank you thank you uh it
 
00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:00.350 align:start position:0%
it yeah thank you thank you uh it
representative

00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:00.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:03.480 align:start position:0%
Jones thank you uh I also am not
 
00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
familiar with the bill but can I ask is
 
00:14:08.069 --> 00:14:08.079 align:start position:0%
is the actual purpose of the bill or
 
00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:10.120 align:start position:0%
maybe the constituent who sent it
 
00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
Forward would know is it it's just to
 
00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
help competition on patented uh meds
 
00:14:18.829 --> 00:14:18.839 align:start position:0%
right is that correct uh thank you for
 
00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:22.120 align:start position:0%
the question I I read the original and I
 
00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
uh candidly very frankly I did not fully
 
00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:27.880 align:start position:0%
understand the intent of it which is why
 
00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:29.720 align:start position:0%
I pressed Senator s
 
00:14:31.949 --> 00:14:31.959 align:start position:0%
or Senator Sweeney uh representative
 
00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:35.720 align:start position:0%
Sweeny to uh help us to
 
00:14:38.829 --> 00:14:38.839 align:start position:0%
clarify the intent I was hoping he would
 
00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:41.360 align:start position:0%
be here today I and he had to be
 
00:14:44.749 --> 00:14:44.759 align:start position:0%
elsewhere so in his absence uh I will
 
00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:47.560 align:start position:0%
say that he was here with this is a
 
00:14:50.509 --> 00:14:50.519 align:start position:0%
constituent uh inspired resolution and
 
00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:53.160 align:start position:0%
he was here with a constituent uh
 
00:14:57.749 --> 00:14:57.759 align:start position:0%
wheelchair abound who had developed or
 
00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
some improvisation that had that to
 
00:15:03.949 --> 00:15:03.959 align:start position:0%
assist people uh I don't know if
 
00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:05.800 align:start position:0%
handicap's the right word but people
 
00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:07.320 align:start position:0%
with challenges or
 
00:15:12.069 --> 00:15:12.079 align:start position:0%
whatever so uh in on line 14 it says
 
00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:15.240 align:start position:0%
whereas the act uh in question the
 
00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
designed patent term extension act
 
00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:19.560 align:start position:0%
whereas the act a aligns the protection
 
00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:21.880 align:start position:0%
of aesthetic non-functional aspects of
 
00:15:24.069 --> 00:15:24.079 align:start position:0%
useful articles with the principles of
 
00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
fairness and Equity simple to co similar
 
00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
to copyright protection uh um my
 
00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:32.720 align:start position:0%
understanding is that this was a way to
 
00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
support the the notion
 
00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
of of uh someone in the handicap
 
00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:42.360 align:start position:0%
Community who uh came up with an
 
00:15:45.309 --> 00:15:45.319 align:start position:0%
innovation in in promoting patent
 
00:15:48.829 --> 00:15:48.839 align:start position:0%
protection for for that
 
00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:51.680 align:start position:0%
Community thank you for that Clarity I
 
00:15:53.309 --> 00:15:53.319 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how much clearer that is
 
00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
but I I like I said I wish
 
00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:56.600 align:start position:0%
representative senen was here
 
00:15:58.470 --> 00:15:58.480 align:start position:0%
representative Manion please it was
 
00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:00.120 align:start position:0%
explained to so the idea here is that
 
00:16:01.749 --> 00:16:01.759 align:start position:0%
the uh design patents would be have
 
00:16:04.509 --> 00:16:04.519 align:start position:0%
their terms extended to be similar in in
 
00:16:07.509 --> 00:16:07.519 align:start position:0%
line with the current copyright law and
 
00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:09.680 align:start position:0%
specifically to help those they call it
 
00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh permanent health conditions in the
 
00:16:14.189 --> 00:16:14.199 align:start position:0%
bill and to help people with that allow
 
00:16:16.389 --> 00:16:16.399 align:start position:0%
them more financial Independence on the
 
00:16:16.399 --> 00:16:17.990 align:start position:0%
them more financial Independence on the
longer

00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
longer
 
00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:21.240 align:start position:0%
term right permanent health condition um
 
00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:25.480 align:start position:0%
is um a euphemism or or it's another way
 
00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:27.160 align:start position:0%
I as I interpret somebody who is
 
00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:30.920 align:start position:0%
permanently disabled is that right yeah
 
00:16:32.949 --> 00:16:32.959 align:start position:0%
someone i s have the hand rep gagy did
 
00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:34.360 align:start position:0%
you have a hand
 
00:16:36.629 --> 00:16:36.639 align:start position:0%
up I've been raising my hand for five
 
00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:42.120 align:start position:0%
minutes oh I I'm so sorry sh uh pleas um
 
00:16:44.389 --> 00:16:44.399 align:start position:0%
I'll be honest with you I I did not know
 
00:16:47.189 --> 00:16:47.199 align:start position:0%
that there was a proposed amendment and
 
00:16:49.389 --> 00:16:49.399 align:start position:0%
the language to me is quite different
 
00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:52.160 align:start position:0%
from the original like you I did not
 
00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:54.680 align:start position:0%
understand what the original was about
 
00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:57.360 align:start position:0%
um and even the title is different and
 
00:17:00.509 --> 00:17:00.519 align:start position:0%
my question is uh do we have a ruling on
 
00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:02.560 align:start position:0%
whether it's actually Germaine since it
 
00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:05.880 align:start position:0%
is so different uh it seems that if you
 
00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
had a hearing on it as a non-gain
 
00:17:10.429 --> 00:17:10.439 align:start position:0%
Amendment people who were actually
 
00:17:12.429 --> 00:17:12.439 align:start position:0%
interested in the subject matter of the
 
00:17:16.029 --> 00:17:16.039 align:start position:0%
amendment might come and testify for
 
00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:18.720 align:start position:0%
it thank you representative in terms of
 
00:17:22.590 --> 00:17:22.600 align:start position:0%
the gerain to the uh original uh I I
 
00:17:25.029 --> 00:17:25.039 align:start position:0%
read both and as as I just said and as
 
00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:28.160 align:start position:0%
you just reiterated uh I had a hard time
 
00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
understanding the original which is why
 
00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh I we asked for the amendment and I
 
00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:39.960 align:start position:0%
there's enough language I I think uh in
 
00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:42.320 align:start position:0%
comparing the original with the amended
 
00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:45.160 align:start position:0%
version that that uh I would say that
 
00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:48.640 align:start position:0%
that it it that Jess is not an
 
00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:51.880 align:start position:0%
issue well my point is that people
 
00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
looking at the amendment might be
 
00:17:55.909 --> 00:17:55.919 align:start position:0%
interested in it probably looking at the
 
00:17:58.549 --> 00:17:58.559 align:start position:0%
original they would not and nobody none
 
00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
of the public out there knew about the
 
00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:04.480 align:start position:0%
amendment right we did uh the amendment
 
00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:06.440 align:start position:0%
was made available and passed out uh
 
00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
several weeks ago we didn't have we
 
00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:11.440 align:start position:0%
weren't able to get to a formal uh uh
 
00:18:13.789 --> 00:18:13.799 align:start position:0%
hearing SL exec at that time but the the
 
00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:16.200 align:start position:0%
amendment um the committee has had the
 
00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:18.400 align:start position:0%
amendment for several
 
00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
weeks and we made copies again today
 
00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:24.440 align:start position:0%
just as U as a
 
00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:28.400 align:start position:0%

representative

00:18:31.549 --> 00:18:31.559 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
Lane uh thank
 
00:18:37.549 --> 00:18:37.559 align:start position:0%
you I Googled design patent term
 
00:18:42.029 --> 00:18:42.039 align:start position:0%
extension act and nothing comes up which
 
00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:44.960 align:start position:0%
gives me some concern and I was
 
00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:48.640 align:start position:0%
wondering if perhaps Our Miss Miss
 
00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
Christine could ass assist us and let us
 
00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:54.440 align:start position:0%
know not you the other
 
00:18:59.310 --> 00:18:59.320 align:start position:0%
one our uh and and and if there's a site
 
00:19:01.789 --> 00:19:01.799 align:start position:0%
that we could at least read the act
 
00:19:05.549 --> 00:19:05.559 align:start position:0%
before I vote on it I like okay I like
 
00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:07.960 align:start position:0%
representative um shirtliff I'm a little
 
00:19:09.789 --> 00:19:09.799 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable about voting for something
 
00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
that I haven't
 
00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:13.360 align:start position:0%
read yeah thank you representative Lane
 
00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:15.480 align:start position:0%
as I said represent Shir a very fair
 
00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
question if uh if our researcher
 
00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:22.120 align:start position:0%
Christina is able to find the uh design
 
00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:26.280 align:start position:0%
patent term extension act uh if it is uh
 
00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:30.360 align:start position:0%
100 Pages or so we may we we may have a
 
00:19:34.549 --> 00:19:34.559 align:start position:0%
recess uh don't laugh
 
00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:39.080 align:start position:0%
we we uh and if we are unable to find it
 
00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:41.480 align:start position:0%
then you know occasionally uh there are
 
00:19:45.549 --> 00:19:45.559 align:start position:0%
those uh uh slight leaps of faith that
 
00:19:48.149 --> 00:19:48.159 align:start position:0%
we have to
 
00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:52.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:56.029 --> 00:19:56.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:59.590 --> 00:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
gagy yeah modifying my comment right now
 
00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
while waiting for um this designed
 
00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:06.640 align:start position:0%
patent term extension act but the only
 
00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:09.400 align:start position:0%
substantive change from the original
 
00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:12.400 align:start position:0%
Bill to the amendment is in the original
 
00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
Bill line 18 dignity through Prosperity
 
00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:19.960 align:start position:0%
act and apparently the uh Congress is
 
00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
has got a bill out which the design
 
00:20:25.669 --> 00:20:25.679 align:start position:0%
patent term extension act so to me
 
00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
that's that's the only substantive
 
00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:28.840 align:start position:0%
change that I see from the original bill
 
00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
amendment yes I'm comparing the two as
 
00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
well uh again representative gagy um the
 
00:20:40.789 --> 00:20:40.799 align:start position:0%
original did refer to the dignity
 
00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:43.360 align:start position:0%
through Prosperity act um in
 
00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:46.480 align:start position:0%
representative Lan when you did and
 
00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for your due diligence uh so
 
00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:52.360 align:start position:0%
you Googled design patent term extension
 
00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:56.520 align:start position:0%
act which is in the amendment and uh and
 
00:20:59.390 --> 00:20:59.400 align:start position:0%
I uh I know Chris our design or or
 
00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:03.480 align:start position:0%
designer or a researcher is uh is
 
00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:07.320 align:start position:0%
following up looking U for the design
 
00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:10.720 align:start position:0%
patent term extension act
 
00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:15.400 align:start position:0%
um I uh I could pull out my device and
 
00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:19.400 align:start position:0%
Google dignity through Pro uh Prosperity
 
00:21:23.549 --> 00:21:23.559 align:start position:0%
act uh ripson Lane you Google design
 
00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
patent term extension act right I did
 
00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:31.240 align:start position:0%
digity oh and ation stat okay okay so
 
00:21:33.269 --> 00:21:33.279 align:start position:0%
that explains why there was there was
 
00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
some questions about immigration someone
 
00:21:41.549 --> 00:21:41.559 align:start position:0%
um had Googled the original okay so
 
00:21:49.669 --> 00:21:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:53.720 align:start position:0%
explain uh yes represent Lloyd sorry I
 
00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
um got stuck in traffic so this may have
 
00:21:57.269 --> 00:21:57.279 align:start position:0%
already been covered I assume this was
 
00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
brought up because of the fact that uh
 
00:22:02.789 --> 00:22:02.799 align:start position:0%
people who are on disability are
 
00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
generally um it's hard to find work
 
00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
because they cannot work um and that's
 
00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:10.720 align:start position:0%
why they qualify for disability so this
 
00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
would allow a person to have income
 
00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:16.760 align:start position:0%
coming in from the uh from what I'm
 
00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
understanding from the um selling of
 
00:22:22.029 --> 00:22:22.039 align:start position:0%
their designs or patents um okay thank
 
00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:24.400 align:start position:0%
you yes Tron man you were shaking your
 
00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:27.440 align:start position:0%
head do you want to uh speak to that no
 
00:22:28.549 --> 00:22:28.559 align:start position:0%
she had the nail on the head that's
 
00:22:31.149 --> 00:22:31.159 align:start position:0%
exactly how it was explained to me yes
 
00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
and again uh representative Sweeny and
 
00:22:35.789 --> 00:22:35.799 align:start position:0%
his constituent were here earlier uh and
 
00:22:39.549 --> 00:22:39.559 align:start position:0%
I I was able to uh speak to them briefly
 
00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:42.320 align:start position:0%
gentleman was was wheelchair bound and
 
00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:44.360 align:start position:0%
and um I don't want to say he was an
 
00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
inventor but he uh had uh come up with
 
00:22:53.549 --> 00:22:53.559 align:start position:0%
some sort of uh creation that fell into
 
00:22:57.630 --> 00:22:57.640 align:start position:0%
copyright patent uh uh issues so to
 
00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:59.230 align:start position:0%
copyright patent uh uh issues so to
speak

00:22:59.230 --> 00:22:59.240 align:start position:0%
speak
 
00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
and I again my interpretation of the
 
00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:06.640 align:start position:0%
intent of the uh sponsor was to uh
 
00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
support uh folks in his situation and
 
00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
condition getting uh Fair consideration
 
00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:15.480 align:start position:0%
for patent
 
00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:19.000 align:start position:0%
extensions uh yes represent C trying to
 
00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:21.200 align:start position:0%
like word this correctly um I guess what
 
00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:23.320 align:start position:0%
I'm saying is is
 
00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
that when it comes to getting a patent
 
00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:28.600 align:start position:0%
this would it's not it's less about an
 
00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:30.760 align:start position:0%
extension of a current patent it's about
 
00:23:32.789 --> 00:23:32.799 align:start position:0%
them getting a patent but if they didn't
 
00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
apply for it
 
00:23:37.710 --> 00:23:37.720 align:start position:0%
first this would give them preferential
 
00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
treatment essentially because of the
 
00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
their disability
 
00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:45.720 align:start position:0%
or I wouldn't uh thank you for your
 
00:23:48.029 --> 00:23:48.039 align:start position:0%
common question uh I don't see that as
 
00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:49.960 align:start position:0%
preferential treatment as I read this I
 
00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:54.320 align:start position:0%
see it as a a a request or a resolution
 
00:23:56.830 --> 00:23:56.840 align:start position:0%
promoting fair fair treatment as opposed
 
00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:00.640 align:start position:0%
to preferential uh is and repr Manion uh
 
00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:02.840 align:start position:0%
I know you introduced I would say so
 
00:24:05.230 --> 00:24:05.240 align:start position:0%
because the idea here is that there's a
 
00:24:06.909 --> 00:24:06.919 align:start position:0%
conflict between like you have copyright
 
00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
that lasts like what whatever Disney's
 
00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:10.440 align:start position:0%
thing was where it was like aund
 
00:24:11.710 --> 00:24:11.720 align:start position:0%
something years and then you have like
 
00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
design patents for like creative
 
00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
components of of whatever the hell is
 
00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:17.360 align:start position:0%
being designed and that has a much
 
00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
shorter life lifespan even though you
 
00:24:22.990 --> 00:24:23.000 align:start position:0%
there should be some kind of unification
 
00:24:24.269 --> 00:24:24.279 align:start position:0%
here like at least they should be
 
00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
treated the same with the same
 
00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:28.909 align:start position:0%
treated the same with the same
timetables

00:24:28.909 --> 00:24:28.919 align:start position:0%
timetables
 
00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:32.480 align:start position:0%
ripson Lloyd well I kind of uh I I guess
 
00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
the biggest question I would have thank
 
00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman by the way um the the
 
00:24:39.389 --> 00:24:39.399 align:start position:0%
biggest question that I would have uh
 
00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:42.360 align:start position:0%
with this is are is this for new patents
 
00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:45.240 align:start position:0%
being um submitted or is this for
 
00:24:47.909 --> 00:24:47.919 align:start position:0%
continuing and ongoing patent if it's
 
00:24:49.909 --> 00:24:49.919 align:start position:0%
continuing and ongoing patent then the
 
00:24:52.909 --> 00:24:52.919 align:start position:0%
work for that patent would have happened
 
00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
prior potentially to this person's
 
00:24:58.389 --> 00:24:58.399 align:start position:0%
disability um to be able to be to
 
00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:00.360 align:start position:0%
continue earning off of that patent in
 
00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:02.480 align:start position:0%
my opinion but thank you for the
 
00:25:04.909 --> 00:25:04.919 align:start position:0%
question uh is in terms of if this
 
00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:08.120 align:start position:0%
applies to a new patent situation or an
 
00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:11.440 align:start position:0%
ongoing uh ranion we in the whereas
 
00:25:13.789 --> 00:25:13.799 align:start position:0%
Clause uh the amended in the amended
 
00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
version uh it does say extend the
 
00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:17.880 align:start position:0%
lifetime design patent terms to
 
00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:20.320 align:start position:0%
individuals yeah so it it it would give
 
00:25:22.669 --> 00:25:22.679 align:start position:0%
them longer extend
 
00:25:25.149 --> 00:25:25.159 align:start position:0%
existing does that kind of speak to your
 
00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:28.600 align:start position:0%
question uh represent sh thank you I did
 
00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
look this up and I found uh the US code
 
00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:36.520 align:start position:0%
site for the U design patent term
 
00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:40.200 align:start position:0%
extension act and it appears that what
 
00:25:42.909 --> 00:25:42.919 align:start position:0%
this is addressing would be a proposed
 
00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:45.960 align:start position:0%
amendment to that okay extending the
 
00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:49.120 align:start position:0%
time that's my impression because it
 
00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:52.720 align:start position:0%
does exist in federal law already uh us
 
00:25:55.029 --> 00:25:55.039 align:start position:0%
code 35 section
 
00:25:59.029 --> 00:25:59.039 align:start position:0%
154 uh through I think it's 156
 
00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:02.200 align:start position:0%
so this if it already exists I'm
 
00:26:05.669 --> 00:26:05.679 align:start position:0%
guessing that this is proposing or
 
00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:09.320 align:start position:0%
addressing a proposal to amend the
 
00:26:12.389 --> 00:26:12.399 align:start position:0%
existing code and I don't know how you
 
00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:15.080 align:start position:0%
find the amendment that's being proposed
 
00:26:19.669 --> 00:26:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:23.950 --> 00:26:23.960 align:start position:0%
doing yeah thank you represent Shu uh
 
00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
and I really appreciate especially as a
 
00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
substitute that you take the time to to
 
00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:31.240 align:start position:0%
do some of this due diligence and same
 
00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:35.480 align:start position:0%
of Representative Lane um again my My
 
00:26:37.789 --> 00:26:37.799 align:start position:0%
Hope had been that the sponsor would be
 
00:26:41.549 --> 00:26:41.559 align:start position:0%
here uh and I'm leaning heavily on poor
 
00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
representative Manion who introduced the
 
00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
uh the proposed amendment um I want to
 
00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:51.440 align:start position:0%
take I have a thought or two that I'll
 
00:26:55.389 --> 00:26:55.399 align:start position:0%
share later once if if anyone else has a
 
00:26:58.990 --> 00:26:59.000 align:start position:0%
question or a comment I know um uh
 
00:27:27.149 --> 00:27:27.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:27.159 --> 00:27:32.950 align:start position:0%
 
any

00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:33.950 align:start position:0%
 
weon

00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:33.960 align:start position:0%
weon
 
00:27:37.389 --> 00:27:37.399 align:start position:0%
Galler so um as a substitute I'd just
 
00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:41.480 align:start position:0%
like to note that um in my home
 
00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:43.240 align:start position:0%
committee at least Municipal and County
 
00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:45.320 align:start position:0%
government we just kind of on General
 
00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:50.960 align:start position:0%
principle vote itl on any um Bill where
 
00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor doesn't show up to
 
00:27:56.190 --> 00:27:56.200 align:start position:0%
introduce it to us um because precisely
 
00:27:57.789 --> 00:27:57.799 align:start position:0%
because of situations like this where
 
00:28:00.149 --> 00:28:00.159 align:start position:0%
people end up having a lot of questions
 
00:28:02.710 --> 00:28:02.720 align:start position:0%
that really only the prime sponsor would
 
00:28:06.389 --> 00:28:06.399 align:start position:0%
be capable of answering adequately due
 
00:28:10.029 --> 00:28:10.039 align:start position:0%
to you know it really being
 
00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:13.240 align:start position:0%
like really figuring out what his intent
 
00:28:15.789 --> 00:28:15.799 align:start position:0%
was here with it like I I don't think
 
00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:18.640 align:start position:0%
any of us can adequately answer that
 
00:28:20.350 --> 00:28:20.360 align:start position:0%
question for
 
00:28:23.269 --> 00:28:23.279 align:start position:0%
him yeah thank you repon of gallager uh
 
00:28:24.669 --> 00:28:24.679 align:start position:0%
I have to point out this is not a bill
 
00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
this is a
 
00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:28.600 align:start position:0%
resolution uh yes and some of you may
 
00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:30.880 align:start position:0%
recall this was initially scheduled and
 
00:28:33.149 --> 00:28:33.159 align:start position:0%
the uh Prime sponsor asked that it be
 
00:28:35.470 --> 00:28:35.480 align:start position:0%
rescheduled because he was unable to be
 
00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:38.120 align:start position:0%
here and we weren't able to work it in
 
00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:42.240 align:start position:0%
to schedule wise to a subsequent session
 
00:28:45.509 --> 00:28:45.519 align:start position:0%
uh which is why we have the hearing and
 
00:28:48.389 --> 00:28:48.399 align:start position:0%
and now the exec session on this today
 
00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:50.320 align:start position:0%
um I have a couple thoughts but thank
 
00:28:53.909 --> 00:28:53.919 align:start position:0%
you for that um but I want to see if
 
00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
anyone else has any uh yes
 
00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:56.830 align:start position:0%
anyone else has any uh yes
representative

00:28:56.830 --> 00:28:56.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:28:59.590 --> 00:28:59.600 align:start position:0%
Jones thank you Mr chair may I ask your
 
00:29:03.070 --> 00:29:03.080 align:start position:0%
researcher a question sure receed thank
 
00:29:08.029 --> 00:29:08.039 align:start position:0%
you um is is there's I believe there's
 
00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:09.480 align:start position:0%
something in there that says this only
 
00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
deals with pre-market patent approval so
 
00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:25.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
that was my question when you mentioned
 
00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
print out uh how how big was it was it
 
00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:50.120 align:start position:0%
have to be or or uh seeing you're right
 
00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:53.720 align:start position:0%
on that would you be able to uh uh
 
00:29:55.669 --> 00:29:55.679 align:start position:0%
paraphrase or or
 
00:29:58.789 --> 00:29:58.799 align:start position:0%
summarize the uh the essence of
 
00:30:04.029 --> 00:30:04.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:09.470 --> 00:30:09.480 align:start position:0%
it sure sure uh again that that's a a
 
00:30:12.029 --> 00:30:12.039 align:start position:0%
good fair question other questions
 
00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:15.240 align:start position:0%
comments yes uh
 
00:30:19.310 --> 00:30:19.320 align:start position:0%
gagy right now I feel like a sailor on
 
00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:23.440 align:start position:0%
ship who's just lost all Communications
 
00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:24.630 align:start position:0%
ship who's just lost all Communications
lost

00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:24.640 align:start position:0%
lost
 
00:30:29.070 --> 00:30:29.080 align:start position:0%
steering and my GPS is not working
 
00:30:32.190 --> 00:30:32.200 align:start position:0%
and you know I I listen to
 
00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:34.840 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher's comments it's
 
00:30:39.269 --> 00:30:39.279 align:start position:0%
a good comment um however if it comes to
 
00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:41.360 align:start position:0%
the point where I still can't make up my
 
00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:43.120 align:start position:0%
mind I would probably recommend
 
00:30:46.389 --> 00:30:46.399 align:start position:0%
something like interum study and give it
 
00:30:51.789 --> 00:30:51.799 align:start position:0%
a a soft Landing so to
 
00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
speak yes thank you representative gagy
 
00:30:59.310 --> 00:30:59.320 align:start position:0%
um was that a motion
 
00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:02.480 align:start position:0%
we we we have a motion on on the floor
 
00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
to on the amendment uh while uh
 
00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:07.840 align:start position:0%
Christina is looking for some more
 
00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:10.480 align:start position:0%
information um I I have a thought or two
 
00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:13.760 align:start position:0%
but again I want to make sure that I
 
00:31:16.909 --> 00:31:16.919 align:start position:0%
don't pass over anyone
 
00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
um so uh my thought on this uh or
 
00:31:24.389 --> 00:31:24.399 align:start position:0%
thoughts are as follows again uh very
 
00:31:25.669 --> 00:31:25.679 align:start position:0%
important this as I mentioned to
 
00:31:27.509 --> 00:31:27.519 align:start position:0%
represent Gallagher this is not a not a
 
00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
bill would be very if this was proposed
 
00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:33.080 align:start position:0%
statute we definitely would not move
 
00:31:36.149 --> 00:31:36.159 align:start position:0%
anything forward uh without some
 
00:31:39.389 --> 00:31:39.399 align:start position:0%
amplification from the prime sponsor uh
 
00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:42.480 align:start position:0%
this is a resolution and I have met the
 
00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
uh it's and most of us have probably all
 
00:31:48.230 --> 00:31:48.240 align:start position:0%
of us have had constituent requests for
 
00:31:50.029 --> 00:31:50.039 align:start position:0%
different types of support I put in a
 
00:31:52.629 --> 00:31:52.639 align:start position:0%
number of bills and resolutions for
 
00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
constituents um of varying types and we
 
00:31:57.870 --> 00:31:57.880 align:start position:0%
want to support obviously our
 
00:32:00.430 --> 00:32:00.440 align:start position:0%
constituents when we can with uh by
 
00:32:02.509 --> 00:32:02.519 align:start position:0%
introducing bills or resolutions which
 
00:32:04.470 --> 00:32:04.480 align:start position:0%
is what uh representative Sweeny did
 
00:32:07.230 --> 00:32:07.240 align:start position:0%
here and I did meet the constitu in
 
00:32:10.509 --> 00:32:10.519 align:start position:0%
question um as I've already said several
 
00:32:12.549 --> 00:32:12.559 align:start position:0%
times I I had a hard time understanding
 
00:32:18.389 --> 00:32:18.399 align:start position:0%
the original and uh the amendment um I
 
00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:21.440 align:start position:0%
am understanding better uh essentially
 
00:32:24.269 --> 00:32:24.279 align:start position:0%
what this comes down to is uh a
 
00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:26.720 align:start position:0%
legislator uh put a resolution in to
 
00:32:29.909 --> 00:32:29.919 align:start position:0%
support a handicapped if I can use that
 
00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
word uh different cons uh different Le
 
00:32:37.389 --> 00:32:37.399 align:start position:0%
right uh cons
 
00:32:40.509 --> 00:32:40.519 align:start position:0%
constituent and uh thank you for I
 
00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:41.960 align:start position:0%
didn't anticipate all questions and
 
00:32:43.549 --> 00:32:43.559 align:start position:0%
these are all good questions that's why
 
00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
we're here
 
00:32:48.629 --> 00:32:48.639 align:start position:0%
um on this resolution the way that I and
 
00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:51.240 align:start position:0%
I'll figure out how I'm going to vote
 
00:32:53.629 --> 00:32:53.639 align:start position:0%
shortly the way I look at it the way I
 
00:32:57.029 --> 00:32:57.039 align:start position:0%
feel about it is I'm inclined to support
 
00:32:58.590 --> 00:32:58.600 align:start position:0%
uh the intent and to support the
 
00:33:00.509 --> 00:33:00.519 align:start position:0%
resolution it's not a Bill's
 
00:33:05.310 --> 00:33:05.320 align:start position:0%
resolution uh aimed at supporting a uh
 
00:33:07.230 --> 00:33:07.240 align:start position:0%
uh a
 
00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:09.720 align:start position:0%
handicapped um
 
00:33:12.389 --> 00:33:12.399 align:start position:0%
constituent now uh representative
 
00:33:14.830 --> 00:33:14.840 align:start position:0%
shift's question it was an excellent
 
00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
question uh if it and we've already
 
00:33:20.029 --> 00:33:20.039 align:start position:0%
addressed that I've spoken to that in
 
00:33:23.669 --> 00:33:23.679 align:start position:0%
that this directs our federal delegation
 
00:33:25.870 --> 00:33:25.880 align:start position:0%
to actively support and advocate for the
 
00:33:28.029 --> 00:33:28.039 align:start position:0%
passage of this congressional act that
 
00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
is looking into um as I said to the
 
00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
representative from
 
00:33:37.629 --> 00:33:37.639 align:start position:0%
Penacook um that does that's if
 
00:33:39.669 --> 00:33:39.679 align:start position:0%
something were to come out that was
 
00:33:41.629 --> 00:33:41.639 align:start position:0%
unored then the federal delegation
 
00:33:43.830 --> 00:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
certainly as I said earlier could uh not
 
00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
support it that would be
 
00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
fine um I cons the way that I would see
 
00:33:52.990 --> 00:33:53.000 align:start position:0%
this moving forward and again I we'll
 
00:33:55.870 --> 00:33:55.880 align:start position:0%
vote on it on the amendment and
 
00:33:58.590 --> 00:33:58.600 align:start position:0%
um would be to have this move forward
 
00:34:01.789 --> 00:34:01.799 align:start position:0%
have the resolution move forward and
 
00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
then uh before it comes to the uh Full
 
00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:09.720 align:start position:0%
House in in in two weeks uh the prime
 
00:34:12.069 --> 00:34:12.079 align:start position:0%
sponsor could uh address and would
 
00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:14.399 align:start position:0%
address and I would ask him to address
 
00:34:19.389 --> 00:34:19.399 align:start position:0%
uh all any and all questions and if uh
 
00:34:22.950 --> 00:34:22.960 align:start position:0%
if he he cannot answer the questions to
 
00:34:25.909 --> 00:34:25.919 align:start position:0%
our our satisfaction to include the subs
 
00:34:27.950 --> 00:34:27.960 align:start position:0%
who who are here today have Tak taking
 
00:34:30.349 --> 00:34:30.359 align:start position:0%
time to work on this then we could vote
 
00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
it down in the house
 
00:34:36.790 --> 00:34:36.800 align:start position:0%
um whereas if we you you know
 
00:34:41.829 --> 00:34:41.839 align:start position:0%
itl this this type of resolution um that
 
00:34:45.270 --> 00:34:45.280 align:start position:0%
uh that kind of hurts my heart a little
 
00:34:48.310 --> 00:34:48.320 align:start position:0%
bit uh given the intent of this this is
 
00:34:50.829 --> 00:34:50.839 align:start position:0%
not like a climate resolution it's it's
 
00:34:54.389 --> 00:34:54.399 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's uh for uh one
 
00:34:57.390 --> 00:34:57.400 align:start position:0%
constituent need that's how I see it um
 
00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
Mr chair uh represent Jones say you saw
 
00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:01.550 align:start position:0%
Mr chair uh represent Jones say you saw
your

00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:01.560 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:35:05.470 --> 00:35:05.480 align:start position:0%
hand thank you Mr chair uh for procedure
 
00:35:09.069 --> 00:35:09.079 align:start position:0%
purposes wouldn't it be okay to do the
 
00:35:10.990 --> 00:35:11.000 align:start position:0%
amendment because that gives it Clarity
 
00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:14.480 align:start position:0%
on what the on what the actual bill is
 
00:35:16.270 --> 00:35:16.280 align:start position:0%
where we're having a problem but that
 
00:35:18.349 --> 00:35:18.359 align:start position:0%
would put the wording in that we need
 
00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
and then from there we could take the
 
00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
amended resolution and do OTP
 
00:35:25.589 --> 00:35:25.599 align:start position:0%
itl uh intermittent or whatever way you
 
00:35:29.150 --> 00:35:29.160 align:start position:0%
want to do it tabling
 
00:35:31.390 --> 00:35:31.400 align:start position:0%
thank you represent represent good point
 
00:35:33.349 --> 00:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
we have a motion on the floor representa
 
00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:36.720 align:start position:0%
shart yes U procedurally you would have
 
00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:39.240 align:start position:0%
another alternative uh if it comes to
 
00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
the floor in two weeks you could still
 
00:35:45.190 --> 00:35:45.200 align:start position:0%
move to recommit it to committee and
 
00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:47.680 align:start position:0%
then perhaps have it come back and do
 
00:35:50.069 --> 00:35:50.079 align:start position:0%
interim study or something rather than
 
00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
actually kill
 
00:35:55.990 --> 00:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
it yes I thank you we were looking to
 
00:35:58.390 --> 00:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
recommit a a measure earlyer
 
00:36:00.589 --> 00:36:00.599 align:start position:0%
uh there's a timeline in terms of
 
00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:03.720 align:start position:0%
getting if it is recommitted uh to
 
00:36:06.430 --> 00:36:06.440 align:start position:0%
reconvene this this committee for this
 
00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:07.470 align:start position:0%
reconvene this this committee for this
one

00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:07.480 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:10.720 align:start position:0%
resolution Uh I that would not be my
 
00:36:12.309 --> 00:36:12.319 align:start position:0%
first choice given the nature of the
 
00:36:16.030 --> 00:36:16.040 align:start position:0%
resolution and and everybody's time uh
 
00:36:18.829 --> 00:36:18.839 align:start position:0%
that you know to to do this again for
 
00:36:22.349 --> 00:36:22.359 align:start position:0%
this uh seems like to me seems like a
 
00:36:25.589 --> 00:36:25.599 align:start position:0%
lot of time and effort and expense uh
 
00:36:27.950 --> 00:36:27.960 align:start position:0%
that I would want to avoid if I could it
 
00:36:30.589 --> 00:36:30.599 align:start position:0%
for this is my thoughts are if this was
 
00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
a bill or or a high-profile re
 
00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
resolution um that would be easier to do
 
00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:39.349 align:start position:0%
resolution um that would be easier to do
that

00:36:39.349 --> 00:36:39.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:36:42.990 --> 00:36:43.000 align:start position:0%
than something given the nature of this
 
00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
so uh represent uh Lloyd sorry one more
 
00:36:49.190 --> 00:36:49.200 align:start position:0%
question uh before we would make any uh
 
00:36:50.950 --> 00:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
potential movements on these H has
 
00:36:52.990 --> 00:36:53.000 align:start position:0%
anybody from Americans with Disabilities
 
00:36:55.829 --> 00:36:55.839 align:start position:0%
wait in on this at all um because I know
 
00:36:58.870 --> 00:36:58.880 align:start position:0%
that they tend to prefer to have some
 
00:37:00.750 --> 00:37:00.760 align:start position:0%
sort of say and have a seat kind of at
 
00:37:03.550 --> 00:37:03.560 align:start position:0%
the table in order to understand better
 
00:37:05.390 --> 00:37:05.400 align:start position:0%
the situation going
 
00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:08.640 align:start position:0%
on yeah thank you for the question uh I
 
00:37:10.190 --> 00:37:10.200 align:start position:0%
have received we have received nothing
 
00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
from um any lobbyist or anyone from any
 
00:37:15.710 --> 00:37:15.720 align:start position:0%
organization and I know that the uh
 
00:37:17.710 --> 00:37:17.720 align:start position:0%
there are the lobbyist folks PE people
 
00:37:22.430 --> 00:37:22.440 align:start position:0%
look at every single uh thing that LSR
 
00:37:25.150 --> 00:37:25.160 align:start position:0%
you know these are all scrutinized very
 
00:37:26.950 --> 00:37:26.960 align:start position:0%
closely now maybe they did and they
 
00:37:32.410 --> 00:37:32.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:32.420 --> 00:37:34.109 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:37:34.109 --> 00:37:34.119 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:37:36.990 --> 00:37:37.000 align:start position:0%
but red light please I'm just saying
 
00:37:39.309 --> 00:37:39.319 align:start position:0%
from the original bill they probably
 
00:37:42.069 --> 00:37:42.079 align:start position:0%
wouldn't even known it applied to them
 
00:37:46.190 --> 00:37:46.200 align:start position:0%
or their their people yes I
 
00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:55.790 --> 00:37:55.800 align:start position:0%
sherff the the I I understand what
 
00:37:57.470 --> 00:37:57.480 align:start position:0%
you're saying about this is a resolu
 
00:38:00.030 --> 00:38:00.040 align:start position:0%
ution as opposed to a bill my only
 
00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:02.200 align:start position:0%
concern is that last paragraph where
 
00:38:04.990 --> 00:38:05.000 align:start position:0%
this this committee is uh strongly
 
00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
saying they strongly support this
 
00:38:09.390 --> 00:38:09.400 align:start position:0%
amendment and they strongly urge our
 
00:38:11.710 --> 00:38:11.720 align:start position:0%
legisl legislators from New Hampshire
 
00:38:14.670 --> 00:38:14.680 align:start position:0%
and Co and Congress to Advocate Advocate
 
00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:17.400 align:start position:0%
on the passage of this bill and you had
 
00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:19.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned about having representative
 
00:38:21.349 --> 00:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
Sweeney come to the floor if there's a
 
00:38:24.550 --> 00:38:24.560 align:start position:0%
question why would it be possible for
 
00:38:27.630 --> 00:38:27.640 align:start position:0%
this committee to do the reverse and
 
00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:29.400 align:start position:0%
only because of our concerns we've
 
00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
expressed about this to do as my friend
 
00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
from Manchester suggested move in um uh
 
00:38:38.589 --> 00:38:38.599 align:start position:0%
to interim study and if representative
 
00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
Sweeney wants to bring a floor amendment
 
00:38:42.670 --> 00:38:42.680 align:start position:0%
to change it and then answer our
 
00:38:44.910 --> 00:38:44.920 align:start position:0%
questions that we have now then I would
 
00:38:47.430 --> 00:38:47.440 align:start position:0%
have no problem vot on the floor when we
 
00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:49.670 align:start position:0%
have no problem vot on the floor when we
next

00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
next
 
00:38:53.790 --> 00:38:53.800 align:start position:0%
meet uh thank you Mr Speaker ameritus so
 
00:38:58.030 --> 00:38:58.040 align:start position:0%
uh you procedurally we this
 
00:39:01.510 --> 00:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
to be recommended for interim study uh
 
00:39:03.550 --> 00:39:03.560 align:start position:0%
before this comes to the floor if if the
 
00:39:05.950 --> 00:39:05.960 align:start position:0%
questions that have come up can be
 
00:39:08.670 --> 00:39:08.680 align:start position:0%
answered can
 
00:39:12.270 --> 00:39:12.280 align:start position:0%
the interim study recommendation be
 
00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:15.349 align:start position:0%
the interim study recommendation be
changed

00:39:15.349 --> 00:39:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:18.829 --> 00:39:18.839 align:start position:0%
uh it can be no well be because
 
00:39:24.230 --> 00:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
oftentimes uh uh an itl can be rejected
 
00:39:26.349 --> 00:39:26.359 align:start position:0%
and a subsequent motion of OTP
 
00:39:30.510 --> 00:39:30.520 align:start position:0%
introduced can an is be rejected uh
 
00:39:32.190 --> 00:39:32.200 align:start position:0%
representative Lane seems to be agreeing
 
00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:33.829 align:start position:0%
representative Lane seems to be agreeing
with

00:39:33.829 --> 00:39:33.839 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:39:38.630 --> 00:39:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:42.270 --> 00:39:42.280 align:start position:0%
Ved make motion it's open to further
 
00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:45.280 align:start position:0%
motions okay so uh that was kind of my
 
00:39:47.150 --> 00:39:47.160 align:start position:0%
question if if we did give this an
 
00:39:49.349 --> 00:39:49.359 align:start position:0%
interim study went to the floor as such
 
00:39:53.349 --> 00:39:53.359 align:start position:0%
our questions are answered uh we vote
 
00:39:56.589 --> 00:39:56.599 align:start position:0%
down interim study and there's a motion
 
00:39:58.390 --> 00:39:58.400 align:start position:0%
subsequent motion for
 
00:40:01.829 --> 00:40:01.839 align:start position:0%
OTP uh that process that procedure
 
00:40:05.069 --> 00:40:05.079 align:start position:0%
sequence could work exactly I would
 
00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:06.800 align:start position:0%
think if the chair of the committee got
 
00:40:09.309 --> 00:40:09.319 align:start position:0%
up and explained to the house that you
 
00:40:11.589 --> 00:40:11.599 align:start position:0%
wanted them to kill the interim study
 
00:40:15.230 --> 00:40:15.240 align:start position:0%
motion and address the uh proposed
 
00:40:17.390 --> 00:40:17.400 align:start position:0%
amendment and Bill that would probably
 
00:40:20.190 --> 00:40:20.200 align:start position:0%
hold a lot of weight I'd prefer that you
 
00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:22.640 align:start position:0%
would explain it all repr sh it but I
 
00:40:26.309 --> 00:40:26.319 align:start position:0%
that's my that would be my job
 
00:40:29.309 --> 00:40:29.319 align:start position:0%
um we've had some very active Subs in
 
00:40:31.069 --> 00:40:31.079 align:start position:0%
this committee and and we don't we don't
 
00:40:32.829 --> 00:40:32.839 align:start position:0%
discourage their
 
00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:36.560 align:start position:0%
participation um so what I'm with the
 
00:40:40.510 --> 00:40:40.520 align:start position:0%
motion on the floor is the the to uh uh
 
00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:43.280 align:start position:0%
adopt the amendment
 
00:40:46.030 --> 00:40:46.040 align:start position:0%
um and then
 
00:40:49.589 --> 00:40:49.599 align:start position:0%
so let let's vote on the amendment the
 
00:40:51.430 --> 00:40:51.440 align:start position:0%
the measure as
 
00:40:53.790 --> 00:40:53.800 align:start position:0%
amended uh and whether to accept the
 
00:40:55.750 --> 00:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
amendment and then we can have a
 
00:40:58.030 --> 00:40:58.040 align:start position:0%
subsequent motion of
 
00:40:59.750 --> 00:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
is OTP
 
00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
itl uh so I want to if there's no other
 
00:41:07.430 --> 00:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
hands like to move the question on the
 
00:41:12.270 --> 00:41:12.280 align:start position:0%
amendment uh and the motion Madame clerk
 
00:41:15.990 --> 00:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
is on
 
00:41:19.230 --> 00:41:19.240 align:start position:0%
Amendment um
 
00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:20.990 align:start position:0%
Amendment um
0599

00:41:20.990 --> 00:41:21.000 align:start position:0%
0599
 
00:41:24.270 --> 00:41:24.280 align:start position:0%
H so the motion is to amend the measure
 
00:41:26.109 --> 00:41:26.119 align:start position:0%
with this amendment seconded by
 
00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
representative gagy
 
00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
um so on the amendment if you would read
 
00:41:34.950 --> 00:41:34.960 align:start position:0%

the uh amended house resolution with the
 
00:42:35.069 --> 00:42:35.079 align:start position:0%
amendment that we just approved uh so
 
00:42:39.349 --> 00:42:39.359 align:start position:0%
now what to do with uh the amended
 
00:42:42.910 --> 00:42:42.920 align:start position:0%
resolution Mr chairman uh repres would
 
00:42:44.790 --> 00:42:44.800 align:start position:0%
it be appropriate for me now to make a
 
00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
motion that we move in to move in from
 
00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:48.640 align:start position:0%
study on this
 
00:42:52.309 --> 00:42:52.319 align:start position:0%
bill uh you can make a motion uh anytime
 
00:42:52.319 --> 00:42:55.270 align:start position:0%
bill uh you can make a motion uh anytime
no

00:42:55.270 --> 00:42:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:57.870 --> 00:42:57.880 align:start position:0%
well trying to be nice to
 
00:42:59.950 --> 00:42:59.960 align:start position:0%
kind I don't want to be too candid I
 
00:43:03.109 --> 00:43:03.119 align:start position:0%
don't want to be all that candid but I
 
00:43:04.910 --> 00:43:04.920 align:start position:0%
would move in from study but I think it
 
00:43:06.270 --> 00:43:06.280 align:start position:0%
might be better if it came from this
 
00:43:07.270 --> 00:43:07.280 align:start position:0%
side of the
 
00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:08.870 align:start position:0%
side of the
aisle

00:43:08.870 --> 00:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
aisle
 
00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
for possibly from the from the from the
 
00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:14.760 align:start position:0%
Democratic side of this
 
00:43:18.630 --> 00:43:18.640 align:start position:0%
committee uh understood uh so I I can I
 
00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
sense there's some interest in making a
 
00:43:23.430 --> 00:43:23.440 align:start position:0%
motion um is there any before we go to
 
00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:24.720 align:start position:0%
the mo is there
 
00:43:26.790 --> 00:43:26.800 align:start position:0%
any the motion hasn't been made yet
 
00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:28.109 align:start position:0%
any the motion hasn't been made yet
officially

00:43:28.109 --> 00:43:28.119 align:start position:0%
officially
 
00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
is there any other thought I just made
 
00:43:32.309 --> 00:43:32.319 align:start position:0%
it Mr chairman okay is there okay there
 
00:43:35.470 --> 00:43:35.480 align:start position:0%
is there is a motion okay is and but is
 
00:43:36.750 --> 00:43:36.760 align:start position:0%
there a second I thought I heard a
 
00:43:38.870 --> 00:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
second second so the motion is interim
 
00:43:40.829 --> 00:43:40.839 align:start position:0%
study from representative shirtliff with
 
00:43:43.710 --> 00:43:43.720 align:start position:0%
a second from representative Lloyd uh
 
00:43:45.430 --> 00:43:45.440 align:start position:0%
repres Shir would you care to speak to
 
00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:46.990 align:start position:0%
repres Shir would you care to speak to
your

00:43:46.990 --> 00:43:47.000 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:43:49.790 --> 00:43:49.800 align:start position:0%
motion thank you Mr chairman uh I think
 
00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:51.200 align:start position:0%
well I think we've all been here we've
 
00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
heard the discussion on this bill uh I
 
00:43:55.549 --> 00:43:55.559 align:start position:0%
think we've got a lot more questions and
 
00:43:57.470 --> 00:43:57.480 align:start position:0%
answers and I appreciate the C of the
 
00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
chair and trying to get the solutions as
 
00:44:01.790 --> 00:44:01.800 align:start position:0%
well as representative Manion for giving
 
00:44:04.430 --> 00:44:04.440 align:start position:0%
the answers he's given us but I think
 
00:44:06.109 --> 00:44:06.119 align:start position:0%
the fact that we're not quite sure what
 
00:44:09.829 --> 00:44:09.839 align:start position:0%
this is about what it entails um it
