we have some bills that are coming up
 
00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 align:start position:0%

00:05:07.249 --> 00:05:07.259 align:start position:0%
in the Senate which are right up over
 
00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:08.510 align:start position:0%
in the Senate which are right up over
there

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 align:start position:0%
um and the first bill I believe that was
 
00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:15.540 align:start position:0%
the 110 bill which was uh adequacy
 
00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 align:start position:0%
distribution that was uh Representative
 
00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:20.040 align:start position:0%
Steve Smith's bill I think he's over
 
00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
there testifying so nobody's passage yet
 
00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:23.759 align:start position:0%

out by the remote access
 
00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:33.960 align:start position:0%

it was quite a bit of discussion a good
 
00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
discussion on this bill
 
00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:24.650 align:start position:0%
discussion on this bill
process

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:24.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:27.050 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:27.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:29.960 align:start position:0%
assistance of Representative
 
00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:32.460 align:start position:0%
representative Ford
 
00:07:34.969 --> 00:07:34.979 align:start position:0%
um we have put together this amendment
 
00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:36.360 align:start position:0%
which I will
 
00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:38.520 align:start position:0%
um everyone has a copy of
 
00:07:41.629 --> 00:07:41.639 align:start position:0%
talking and just to go through it
 
00:07:41.639 --> 00:07:44.510 align:start position:0%
talking and just to go through it
um

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:49.380 align:start position:0%
the first section remains in terms of uh
 
00:07:52.969 --> 00:07:52.979 align:start position:0%
the burden of proof in due processary
 
00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
and in the amendment that
 
00:08:00.409 --> 00:08:00.419 align:start position:0%
new sections with establishing the
 
00:08:00.419 --> 00:08:01.909 align:start position:0%
new sections with establishing the
committee

00:08:01.909 --> 00:08:01.919 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:05.340 align:start position:0%
it would have three three members from
 
00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:07.620 align:start position:0%
the house in one minute remember from
 
00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:11.220 align:start position:0%
the Senate uh and patients and duties
 
00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:13.500 align:start position:0%
start out with
 
00:08:16.309 --> 00:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
the beginning of the process which is
 
00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:20.240 align:start position:0%
the child's fine requirements to provide
 
00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:28.500 align:start position:0%
a and then it goes into the actual IDP
 
00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:30.240 align:start position:0%
um where I see
 
00:08:36.829 --> 00:08:36.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:40.020 align:start position:0%
some things that work well in the it
 
00:08:42.769 --> 00:08:42.779 align:start position:0%
meetings and sometimes things do not
 
00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:45.080 align:start position:0%
work well
 
00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:50.700 align:start position:0%
so that is a I think a good
 
00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:53.940 align:start position:0%
place to look at the process and the
 
00:08:57.829 --> 00:08:57.839 align:start position:0%
roles of the members uh of the team and
 
00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:01.080 align:start position:0%
um the actual consent that's required by
 
00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:12.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:16.760 align:start position:0%
requirements and also the
 
00:09:20.449 --> 00:09:20.459 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire process for Speed
 
00:09:20.459 --> 00:09:23.509 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire process for Speed
resolution

00:09:23.509 --> 00:09:23.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:26.940 align:start position:0%
they would examine the supports for
 
00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:31.080 align:start position:0%
parents which is certainly been an issue
 
00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:34.620 align:start position:0%
with its testimony that we've heard and
 
00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:36.280 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:37.990 align:start position:0%
the um
[Music]

00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:41.820 align:start position:0%
to know all the requirements and
 
00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:45.060 align:start position:0%
regulations but what support is
 
00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:46.880 align:start position:0%
available for them
 
00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:49.760 align:start position:0%
in addition to the legal
 
00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
supports that are often need for the due
 
00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:55.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:01.100 align:start position:0%
um also you would take a look at the
 
00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
Department of Education monitoring of
 
00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:06.620 align:start position:0%
the process both
 
00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:11.220 align:start position:0%
iepa and state law requirements uh as
 
00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:13.980 align:start position:0%
well as parental complaints that are
 
00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:18.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:21.240 align:start position:0%
it's important would be to look at uh
 
00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:24.600 align:start position:0%
opportunities or best practices in
 
00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:28.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:34.380 align:start position:0%
some information on other state
 
00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
that seem to have
 
00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:39.250 align:start position:0%
that seem to have
separate

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:39.260 align:start position:0%
separate
 
00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:41.660 align:start position:0%
supports for parents
 
00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:45.180 align:start position:0%
in due process
 
00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:48.240 align:start position:0%
hearings and uh all the way up through
 
00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:56.389 --> 00:10:56.399 align:start position:0%
and then certainly take testimony and
 
00:10:59.650 --> 00:10:59.660 align:start position:0%
consult with the parents and state
 
00:11:04.069 --> 00:11:04.079 align:start position:0%
agencies and other experts as required
 
00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:07.260 align:start position:0%
and then developed a report with any
 
00:11:09.889 --> 00:11:09.899 align:start position:0%
recommendations for improving the
 
00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:12.420 align:start position:0%
process and I think that that works as a
 
00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:15.240 align:start position:0%
key thing that really the entire
 
00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:18.240 align:start position:0%
committee wanted to
 
00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
people forward on
 
00:11:25.269 --> 00:11:25.279 align:start position:0%
to help the situation uh testimony tag
 
00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:29.700 align:start position:0%
and the report will be required by the
 
00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:32.420 align:start position:0%
first of November
 
00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
so it's basically that's the uh the
 
00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:37.860 align:start position:0%
amendment and um
 
00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:41.220 align:start position:0%
I think that it does strengthen the bill
 
00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:50.269 --> 00:11:50.279 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of support in the heart to
 
00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
pass as amended motion thank you very
 
00:11:54.769 --> 00:11:54.779 align:start position:0%
much representative Mullen would you
 
00:11:56.449 --> 00:11:56.459 align:start position:0%
like to meet the second would you like
 
00:12:00.769 --> 00:12:00.779 align:start position:0%
to add anything to this uh just to Echo
 
00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:03.240 align:start position:0%
what representative cordelli has said I
 
00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:05.820 align:start position:0%
think it's important for parents to
 
00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:08.940 align:start position:0%
recognize that the entire committee
 
00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:12.920 align:start position:0%
heard their plea as they came forward
 
00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:17.700 align:start position:0%
and that we are all in agreement that we
 
00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:20.180 align:start position:0%
would like to do a deeper dive to see
 
00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:24.660 align:start position:0%
where the root of the problem is and how
 
00:12:26.949 --> 00:12:26.959 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education can assist
 
00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:30.360 align:start position:0%
and what we can do as a legislative body
 
00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:34.200 align:start position:0%
to sort of lessen this perception that
 
00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
we've got a David and Goliath situation
 
00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:39.660 align:start position:0%
here and work towards making sure that
 
00:12:41.389 --> 00:12:41.399 align:start position:0%
special education students in New
 
00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:44.100 align:start position:0%
Hampshire all have their needs met
 
00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:48.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:51.009 --> 00:12:51.019 align:start position:0%
any further discussion on
 
00:12:55.730 --> 00:12:55.740 align:start position:0%

00:17:10.370 --> 00:17:10.380 align:start position:0%
he had a study committee I think about
 
00:17:12.189 --> 00:17:12.199 align:start position:0%
three years ago
 
00:17:16.549 --> 00:17:16.559 align:start position:0%
also and it's been a difficult
 
00:17:20.829 --> 00:17:20.839 align:start position:0%
difficult to pass it because of the
 
00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:23.780 align:start position:0%
number of Cooperative school districts
 
00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:27.780 align:start position:0%
and the differences in the approach and
 
00:17:31.549 --> 00:17:31.559 align:start position:0%
contracts within those districts
 
00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
is simpler than some but
 
00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:43.490 align:start position:0%
is simpler than some but
um

00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:43.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:48.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:52.669 --> 00:17:52.679 align:start position:0%
uh yes yes Mr chair I would move that we
 
00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
um I believe that that you've addressed
 
00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:11.220 align:start position:0%
the point that we these are very unique
 
00:18:13.370 --> 00:18:13.380 align:start position:0%
situations this is something where
 
00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
Perhaps Perhaps this this change would
 
00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:17.460 align:start position:0%
benefit some school Cooperative school
 
00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:18.780 align:start position:0%
districts but there's so many different
 
00:18:20.570 --> 00:18:20.580 align:start position:0%
ways that this is implemented across the
 
00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:23.460 align:start position:0%
state that doing the subjects and all of
 
00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
this all of the Cooperative school
 
00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:27.240 align:start position:0%
districts to this one solution just
 
00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:28.740 align:start position:0%
doesn't doesn't quite seem to make sense
 
00:18:30.529 --> 00:18:30.539 align:start position:0%
we should retain this work on it and see
 
00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:32.340 align:start position:0%
if we can do something that will address
 
00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:44.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:45.289 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:18:45.289 --> 00:18:45.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:48.600 align:start position:0%
any comments from other committee
 
00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:52.380 align:start position:0%
members about the retained motion on
 
00:18:57.250 --> 00:18:57.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:01.260 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair so I'm
 
00:19:03.409 --> 00:19:03.419 align:start position:0%
surprised actually that the motion is to
 
00:19:03.419 --> 00:19:04.850 align:start position:0%
surprised actually that the motion is to
retain

00:19:04.850 --> 00:19:04.860 align:start position:0%
retain
 
00:19:07.549 --> 00:19:07.559 align:start position:0%
um on this because uh it seemed that
 
00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:11.580 align:start position:0%
during the um during the hearing we
 
00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:13.620 align:start position:0%
heard from the the sponsor but we also
 
00:19:17.029 --> 00:19:17.039 align:start position:0%
heard from um former member uh Jim
 
00:19:19.789 --> 00:19:19.799 align:start position:0%
Belanger speaking about the importance
 
00:19:22.090 --> 00:19:22.100 align:start position:0%
of it and from school boards Association
 
00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:26.700 align:start position:0%
that that that this this doesn't add a
 
00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:27.590 align:start position:0%
that that that this this doesn't add a
new

00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
new
 
00:19:30.289 --> 00:19:30.299 align:start position:0%
um you know wrinkle to uh to Cooperative
 
00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:32.940 align:start position:0%
school districts it basically is a it
 
00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:34.930 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:35.450 align:start position:0%
it's a
[Music]

00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:35.460 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:36.169 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

00:19:36.169 --> 00:19:36.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
it's it's an amendment to a procedure
 
00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:41.820 align:start position:0%
that already applies to uh to
 
00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
Cooperative school districts and and uh
 
00:19:47.029 --> 00:19:47.039 align:start position:0%
you know simply ads I think the the
 
00:19:49.909 --> 00:19:49.919 align:start position:0%
condition that um that when the current
 
00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:52.200 align:start position:0%
formula is passed you know to continue
 
00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:55.140 align:start position:0%
doing it that uh that that that sets up
 
00:19:57.710 --> 00:19:57.720 align:start position:0%
the uh The Five-Year review time frame
 
00:19:59.630 --> 00:19:59.640 align:start position:0%
um as it would if it was a had been
 
00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
amended so uh you know I think that I I
 
00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:05.220 align:start position:0%
guess I'm not quite sure what the what
 
00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:07.320 align:start position:0%
the issue is you know this isn't the
 
00:20:09.529 --> 00:20:09.539 align:start position:0%
hill I'm gonna die on but I don't
 
00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:16.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:20.210 --> 00:20:20.220 align:start position:0%
yes I I don't understand either this is
 
00:20:24.490 --> 00:20:24.500 align:start position:0%
this is a simple bit it's already in law
 
00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:28.860 align:start position:0%
and all it does is just allow them to
 
00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
continue with the present contract
 
00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:34.980 align:start position:0%
um because the way it's stated in law it
 
00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:37.380 align:start position:0%
just says that you know they have to
 
00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
change something so what they've had to
 
00:20:43.549 --> 00:20:43.559 align:start position:0%
do in the past is is to add a dollar to
 
00:20:46.669 --> 00:20:46.679 align:start position:0%
the budget or or take it all out or
 
00:20:46.679 --> 00:20:47.510 align:start position:0%
the budget or or take it all out or
whatever

00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:49.740 align:start position:0%
so that they could pass it because it's
 
00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:52.200 align:start position:0%
a good agreement they like it they want
 
00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
to keep it but the way it's stated in
 
00:20:57.169 --> 00:20:57.179 align:start position:0%
law it says that they have to change
 
00:20:57.179 --> 00:20:58.310 align:start position:0%
law it says that they have to change
something

00:20:58.310 --> 00:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:21:01.669 --> 00:21:01.679 align:start position:0%
and so all this does is take that away
 
00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:03.720 align:start position:0%
and and I think
 
00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
I I don't understand I thought this
 
00:21:09.890 --> 00:21:09.900 align:start position:0%
would be a no-brainer on campus oh it
 
00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:11.940 align:start position:0%
kind of confuses me too and I know that
 
00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
representative delandi was very uh is
 
00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
very knowledgeable in this area uh in in
 
00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:22.500 align:start position:0%
the past that they thought uh always uh
 
00:21:24.610 --> 00:21:24.620 align:start position:0%
very strong
 
00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
education supporter and everything and I
 
00:21:30.409 --> 00:21:30.419 align:start position:0%
think he knows uh his uh his business
 
00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
very well and he was
 
00:21:36.409 --> 00:21:36.419 align:start position:0%
very vehement about having this pass
 
00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
because it's just necessary to conduct
 
00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:40.549 align:start position:0%
because it's just necessary to conduct
business

00:21:40.549 --> 00:21:40.559 align:start position:0%
business
 
00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:44.340 align:start position:0%
so I'm surprised at the retain also
 
00:21:50.149 --> 00:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:52.380 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair
 
00:21:54.289 --> 00:21:54.299 align:start position:0%
um I worked at Kearsarge which is a
 
00:21:56.330 --> 00:21:56.340 align:start position:0%
Cooperative District of
 
00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
um seven towns and uh if if the formula
 
00:22:05.649 --> 00:22:05.659 align:start position:0%
could be revised every year
 
00:22:09.770 --> 00:22:09.780 align:start position:0%
it just doesn't add continuity to to the
 
00:22:11.810 --> 00:22:11.820 align:start position:0%
whole school district
 
00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:13.320 align:start position:0%
um things have worked out really well
 
00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
we've been uh in existence
 
00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
um since 1970 and had a couple of
 
00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:22.860 align:start position:0%
changes to the formula over over that
 
00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:26.280 align:start position:0%
time but I think this bill should be
 
00:22:28.850 --> 00:22:28.860 align:start position:0%
ought to pass it's it puts it in in
 
00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
writing kind of clarifies the current
 
00:22:34.690 --> 00:22:34.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:36.470 align:start position:0%
 
places

00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
places
 
00:22:39.529 --> 00:22:39.539 align:start position:0%
yeah I actually have to admit I'm a
 
00:22:41.149 --> 00:22:41.159 align:start position:0%
little surprise when we were retaining
 
00:22:43.730 --> 00:22:43.740 align:start position:0%
it as well because it didn't actually
 
00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:46.440 align:start position:0%
change anything on the funding formulas
 
00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:50.460 align:start position:0%
or anything because all it does is
 
00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:52.440 align:start position:0%
like they were saying keep them from
 
00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:54.360 align:start position:0%
having to make a change of one dollar so
 
00:22:56.810 --> 00:22:56.820 align:start position:0%
what I'm wondering is if anybody knows
 
00:22:58.970 --> 00:22:58.980 align:start position:0%
of any school districts that this any
 
00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
Cooperative school districts that would
 
00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:11.000 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:11.010 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:11.010 --> 00:23:13.909 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:23:13.909 --> 00:23:13.919 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:16.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair appreciate it
 
00:23:19.850 --> 00:23:19.860 align:start position:0%
um I I would concur with with uh the
 
00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:22.260 align:start position:0%
fellow speakers uh representative McGee
 
00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
brought this as a one-line change who
 
00:23:27.169 --> 00:23:27.179 align:start position:0%
doesn't change the thing except make
 
00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
that uh School Board uh more more
 
00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:32.520 align:start position:0%
cooperative for Cooperative it saves a
 
00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
whole lot of town meeting uh snags it
 
00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:37.260 align:start position:0%
doesn't do a thing except help it and
 
00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
you have two Town moderators both spoken
 
00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:41.940 align:start position:0%
favor no one's complaining about the
 
00:23:44.090 --> 00:23:44.100 align:start position:0%
bill I mean at some point when people
 
00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:46.380 align:start position:0%
bring bills to the legislation and ask
 
00:23:48.529 --> 00:23:48.539 align:start position:0%
for help to their own little towns they
 
00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
know the issue it doesn't hurt a thing
 
00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
you know it makes no sense that we just
 
00:23:55.970 --> 00:23:55.980 align:start position:0%
retain this you know you're causing a
 
00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:00.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:02.149 align:start position:0%
 
prevention

00:24:02.149 --> 00:24:02.159 align:start position:0%

um

00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:14.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:17.280 align:start position:0%

00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:27.000 align:start position:0%
oh okay
 
00:24:29.770 --> 00:24:29.780 align:start position:0%
we've had a request for our pockets from
 
00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:32.520 align:start position:0%
a representative here in the committee
 
00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:33.649 align:start position:0%

00:35:29.810 --> 00:35:29.820 align:start position:0%
motion on House Bill 150. okay I never
 
00:35:31.630 --> 00:35:31.640 align:start position:0%

00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
yeah so withdraw my second
 
00:35:37.370 --> 00:35:37.380 align:start position:0%
okay may I make a motion
 
00:35:41.630 --> 00:35:41.640 align:start position:0%

okay I'll second that okay great
 
00:35:53.450 --> 00:35:53.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:54.589 align:start position:0%
 
it's

00:35:54.589 --> 00:35:54.599 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:35:56.450 --> 00:35:56.460 align:start position:0%
expressing its Shaw
 
00:36:01.690 --> 00:36:01.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
further discussion on uh
 
00:36:09.050 --> 00:36:09.060 align:start position:0%
that past Amendment Representative no I
 
00:36:11.390 --> 00:36:11.400 align:start position:0%
think what I stated before it's in my
 
00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:14.960 align:start position:0%
correction uh to make life easier for
 
00:36:18.349 --> 00:36:18.359 align:start position:0%
Cooperative School Board districts and I
 
00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:20.640 align:start position:0%
think they have enough problems not
 
00:36:22.670 --> 00:36:22.680 align:start position:0%
getting everybody on board and I think
 
00:36:26.870 --> 00:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
that this is certainly uh a minor thing
 
00:36:29.810 --> 00:36:29.820 align:start position:0%
that we can do that that helps as
 
00:36:33.589 --> 00:36:33.599 align:start position:0%
president Tanner said continuity very
 
00:36:36.890 --> 00:36:36.900 align:start position:0%
important and and Cooperative districts
 
00:36:39.410 --> 00:36:39.420 align:start position:0%
unless there's some major change like a
 
00:36:40.849 --> 00:36:40.859 align:start position:0%
Dropout or something
 
00:36:44.690 --> 00:36:44.700 align:start position:0%
so uh past experience
 
00:36:46.609 --> 00:36:46.619 align:start position:0%
that's it okay
 
00:36:50.930 --> 00:36:50.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:53.569 --> 00:36:53.579 align:start position:0%
um I I agree that that this we might as
 
00:36:55.010 --> 00:36:55.020 align:start position:0%
well go ahead and pass this that'll help
 
00:36:56.569 --> 00:36:56.579 align:start position:0%
out some of the school districts and it
 
00:36:58.730 --> 00:36:58.740 align:start position:0%
just seem like it'll harm any others
 
00:37:00.170 --> 00:37:00.180 align:start position:0%

00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:38.030 align:start position:0%
 
discrimination

00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:38.040 align:start position:0%

00:38:46.310 --> 00:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
Mr chair can you repeat the number
 
00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:48.069 align:start position:0%
Mr chair can you repeat the number
please

00:38:48.069 --> 00:38:48.079 align:start position:0%
please
 
00:38:51.410 --> 00:38:51.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:54.109 --> 00:38:54.119 align:start position:0%
I would like to make a motion to retain
 
00:38:57.530 --> 00:38:57.540 align:start position:0%
house bill 198.
 
00:39:00.109 --> 00:39:00.119 align:start position:0%
I'll second that
 
00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:09.410 --> 00:39:09.420 align:start position:0%
we'd like to uh sure comments
 
00:39:12.170 --> 00:39:12.180 align:start position:0%
according to this bill was based on some
 
00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:13.250 align:start position:0%
according to this bill was based on some
federal

00:39:13.250 --> 00:39:13.260 align:start position:0%
federal
 
00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:16.160 align:start position:0%
um wording and regulation
 
00:39:19.849 --> 00:39:19.859 align:start position:0%
and we have decided that it is
 
00:39:22.310 --> 00:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
it could be
 
00:39:24.589 --> 00:39:24.599 align:start position:0%
worded differently and better and we
 
00:39:26.450 --> 00:39:26.460 align:start position:0%
need to look at this issue a little
 
00:39:29.089 --> 00:39:29.099 align:start position:0%
longer so
 
00:39:31.970 --> 00:39:31.980 align:start position:0%
we thought we'd retain it and see if we
 
00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:41.930 --> 00:39:41.940 align:start position:0%
uh not just concurrent uh representative
 
00:39:44.870 --> 00:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Milo uh thank
 
00:39:48.530 --> 00:39:48.540 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair uh typically
 
00:39:50.750 --> 00:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
when we retain a bill
 
00:39:53.030 --> 00:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
there's usually support
 
00:39:55.750 --> 00:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
however this particular bill
 
00:39:59.150 --> 00:39:59.160 align:start position:0%
from our caucus perspective
 
00:40:01.250 --> 00:40:01.260 align:start position:0%
is so onerous
 
00:40:05.089 --> 00:40:05.099 align:start position:0%
that it's our intent to vote no on the
 
00:40:06.770 --> 00:40:06.780 align:start position:0%
retention of the bill because we believe
 
00:40:09.109 --> 00:40:09.119 align:start position:0%
that it should be Ito
 
00:40:11.510 --> 00:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
this is an unusual move on the part of
 
00:40:14.390 --> 00:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
our caucus but it represents I think the
 
00:40:15.950 --> 00:40:15.960 align:start position:0%
emotion that we have
 
00:40:18.890 --> 00:40:18.900 align:start position:0%
about the need for this bill not to pass
 
00:40:21.770 --> 00:40:21.780 align:start position:0%
in any form whatsoever and even be
 
00:40:24.650 --> 00:40:24.660 align:start position:0%
worked on whatsoever because of the
 
00:40:26.930 --> 00:40:26.940 align:start position:0%
nature of the bill and the vast
 
00:40:28.910 --> 00:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
testimony that we've had
 
00:40:31.130 --> 00:40:31.140 align:start position:0%
from people who are in opposition to
 
00:40:35.089 --> 00:40:35.099 align:start position:0%
this bill that we've basically feel that
 
00:40:38.990 --> 00:40:39.000 align:start position:0%
the guidelines of the nhiaa which allows
 
00:40:41.930 --> 00:40:41.940 align:start position:0%
for local school districts to make the
 
00:40:44.810 --> 00:40:44.820 align:start position:0%
determination of transgender athletes
 
00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
and that's we support that proposition
 
00:40:50.569 --> 00:40:50.579 align:start position:0%
so our caucus will be voting no on this
 
00:40:52.849 --> 00:40:52.859 align:start position:0%
right retention because of our feelings
 
00:40:55.130 --> 00:40:55.140 align:start position:0%
about the essence of this particular
 
00:40:57.230 --> 00:40:57.240 align:start position:0%
proposal thank you
 
00:40:59.930 --> 00:40:59.940 align:start position:0%
it's representative
 
00:40:59.940 --> 00:41:03.470 align:start position:0%
it's representative
discussion

00:41:03.470 --> 00:41:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:06.170 --> 00:41:06.180 align:start position:0%
aggressive scanner
 
00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:41:11.210 --> 00:41:11.220 align:start position:0%
um I feel the same way uh this bill is
 
00:41:13.849 --> 00:41:13.859 align:start position:0%
unnecessary it's misguided it's
 
00:41:17.089 --> 00:41:17.099 align:start position:0%
misinformed it's discriminatory and it's
 
00:41:17.099 --> 00:41:19.130 align:start position:0%
misinformed it's discriminatory and it's
dangerous

00:41:19.130 --> 00:41:19.140 align:start position:0%
dangerous
 
00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:22.200 align:start position:0%
um in committee we received no report or
 
00:41:24.290 --> 00:41:24.300 align:start position:0%
testimony that there's any issue of
 
00:41:26.569 --> 00:41:26.579 align:start position:0%
safety or or fairness in New Hampshire
 
00:41:28.490 --> 00:41:28.500 align:start position:0%
Youth Sports from the current inclusion
 
00:41:30.770 --> 00:41:30.780 align:start position:0%
of transgender athletes
 
00:41:33.770 --> 00:41:33.780 align:start position:0%
we did hear testimony that this bill
 
00:41:36.410 --> 00:41:36.420 align:start position:0%
would deny access and inclusion of
 
00:41:38.270 --> 00:41:38.280 align:start position:0%
transgender girls and women in sports
 
00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:39.470 align:start position:0%
transgender girls and women in sports
programs

00:41:39.470 --> 00:41:39.480 align:start position:0%
programs
 
00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:41.640 align:start position:0%
and it would adversely affect the mental
 
00:41:43.750 --> 00:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
and physical health by excluding
 
00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:47.160 align:start position:0%
isolating and targeting transgender
 
00:41:49.010 --> 00:41:49.020 align:start position:0%
girls and women
 
00:41:51.589 --> 00:41:51.599 align:start position:0%
there's no need to interfere with the
 
00:41:53.690 --> 00:41:53.700 align:start position:0%
current inclusion policies of 50 of our
 
00:41:56.450 --> 00:41:56.460 align:start position:0%
high schools and organizations like the
 
00:42:00.770 --> 00:42:00.780 align:start position:0%
nhiaa and the NCAA who are the
 
00:42:02.810 --> 00:42:02.820 align:start position:0%
organizations that oversee the fairness
 
00:42:04.730 --> 00:42:04.740 align:start position:0%
and safety of sports competition in
 
00:42:07.250 --> 00:42:07.260 align:start position:0%
schools and currently have inclusion
 
00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:08.630 align:start position:0%
schools and currently have inclusion
policies

00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:08.640 align:start position:0%
policies
 
00:42:11.089 --> 00:42:11.099 align:start position:0%
this bill is asking us
 
00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
to seek an exception to our current
 
00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
discrimination laws I think all New
 
00:42:19.609 --> 00:42:19.619 align:start position:0%
Hampshire students need and deserve
 
00:42:22.250 --> 00:42:22.260 align:start position:0%
protections against discrimination as
 
00:42:27.130 --> 00:42:27.140 align:start position:0%
defined in our statute RSA 193 colon 38
 
00:42:31.490 --> 00:42:31.500 align:start position:0%
including gender identity thank you
 
00:42:34.250 --> 00:42:34.260 align:start position:0%
all right thank you representative
 
00:42:38.030 --> 00:42:38.040 align:start position:0%
Tanner and chairman laddin joined us so

yes I do Mr chair thank you so much
 
00:42:55.730 --> 00:42:55.740 align:start position:0%
um I representative Tana's worries were
 
00:42:58.130 --> 00:42:58.140 align:start position:0%
eloquent and representative Milo's
 
00:43:00.410 --> 00:43:00.420 align:start position:0%
philosophy is accurate
 
00:43:02.930 --> 00:43:02.940 align:start position:0%
um I would just add that I I know I'm
 
00:43:04.670 --> 00:43:04.680 align:start position:0%
someone new to the game only two
 
00:43:07.370 --> 00:43:07.380 align:start position:0%
sessions in but I do recall that the
 
00:43:10.550 --> 00:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
retained bill is to make improvements
 
00:43:13.790 --> 00:43:13.800 align:start position:0%
this bill came two years ago it was bad
 
00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:14.809 align:start position:0%
this bill came two years ago it was bad
then

00:43:14.809 --> 00:43:14.819 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:43:17.390 --> 00:43:17.400 align:start position:0%
and we voted down it wasn't approved
 
00:43:19.609 --> 00:43:19.619 align:start position:0%
this year it's bad now and it should be
 
00:43:27.069 --> 00:43:27.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:30.670 --> 00:43:30.680 align:start position:0%
further discussion uh representative
 
00:43:33.950 --> 00:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you very much Mr chair so I
 
00:43:36.170 --> 00:43:36.180 align:start position:0%
agree with with everything my esteemed
 
00:43:39.230 --> 00:43:39.240 align:start position:0%
colleagues have um have have said about
 
00:43:41.089 --> 00:43:41.099 align:start position:0%
um about this and why we should vote no
 
00:43:43.790 --> 00:43:43.800 align:start position:0%
on the on the motion to retain and vote
 
00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
Yes on a motion to um to itl this um uh
 
00:43:50.809 --> 00:43:50.819 align:start position:0%
this bill you know just looking at the
 
00:43:53.450 --> 00:43:53.460 align:start position:0%
the the significant testimony I think we
 
00:43:57.410 --> 00:43:57.420 align:start position:0%
had 31 people testify the only people
 
00:43:59.569 --> 00:43:59.579 align:start position:0%
um testifying and support were the prime
 
00:44:02.809 --> 00:44:02.819 align:start position:0%
sponsor and um and a person who said she
 
00:44:05.089 --> 00:44:05.099 align:start position:0%
was representing all girls in sports
 
00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
which is just an outrageous
 
00:44:09.890 --> 00:44:09.900 align:start position:0%
um comment and uh and completely
 
00:44:13.309 --> 00:44:13.319 align:start position:0%
inaccurate so so uh for that reason and
 
00:44:16.010 --> 00:44:16.020 align:start position:0%
then compounded by the fact that there
 
00:44:18.829 --> 00:44:18.839 align:start position:0%
was a blue she tally of 24 inch support
 
00:44:18.839 --> 00:44:20.349 align:start position:0%
was a blue she tally of 24 inch support
and

00:44:20.349 --> 00:44:20.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:44:20.359 --> 00:44:22.390 align:start position:0%
and
1135

00:44:22.390 --> 00:44:22.400 align:start position:0%
1135
 
00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
1135 people in opposition
 
00:44:28.970 --> 00:44:28.980 align:start position:0%
um to this bill I think um I think this
 
00:44:31.550 --> 00:44:31.560 align:start position:0%
bill certainly warrants being being
 
00:44:37.210 --> 00:44:37.220 align:start position:0%
dispatched today as um as as itl
 
00:44:40.190 --> 00:44:40.200 align:start position:0%

um to the original bill has two changes
 
00:49:32.990 --> 00:49:33.000 align:start position:0%
that were recommended by the chair and
 
00:49:35.930 --> 00:49:35.940 align:start position:0%
others simply adds two words it adds the
 
00:49:38.569 --> 00:49:38.579 align:start position:0%
word talented to gifted and talented and
 
00:49:41.710 --> 00:49:41.720 align:start position:0%
it adds the words programs to policies
 
00:49:44.089 --> 00:49:44.099 align:start position:0%
and procedures
 
00:49:46.730 --> 00:49:46.740 align:start position:0%
so that is the amendment
 
00:49:51.170 --> 00:49:51.180 align:start position:0%
um and on the on the the bill itself uh
 
00:49:52.970 --> 00:49:52.980 align:start position:0%
I would just say that this is a bill
 
00:49:56.270 --> 00:49:56.280 align:start position:0%
that this committee heard in uh 2018 it
 
00:49:58.329 --> 00:49:58.339 align:start position:0%
was referred to interim study
 
00:50:01.690 --> 00:50:01.700 align:start position:0%
uh seven member interim study committee
 
00:50:01.700 --> 00:50:03.309 align:start position:0%
uh seven member interim study committee
uh

00:50:03.309 --> 00:50:03.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:50:06.890 --> 00:50:06.900 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly to uh recommend OTP it
 
00:50:09.290 --> 00:50:09.300 align:start position:0%
came to the foot this full uh
 
00:50:12.410 --> 00:50:12.420 align:start position:0%
Committee in September of 2018 in the
 
00:50:15.410 --> 00:50:15.420 align:start position:0%
full committee uh the motion is made by
 
00:50:17.349 --> 00:50:17.359 align:start position:0%
representative Shaw seconded by
 
00:50:19.490 --> 00:50:19.500 align:start position:0%
representative Mary geil and the full
 
00:50:23.030 --> 00:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
committee uh at that time voted uh
 
00:50:26.510 --> 00:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
to recommend OTP of course uh this was a
 
00:50:29.690 --> 00:50:29.700 align:start position:0%
September of 2018 and the bill did not
 
00:50:31.390 --> 00:50:31.400 align:start position:0%
have a chance to go to the Full House
 
00:50:35.390 --> 00:50:35.400 align:start position:0%
and then um it whatever I was not here
 
00:50:37.130 --> 00:50:37.140 align:start position:0%
the subsequent term I'm not sure what
 
00:50:40.309 --> 00:50:40.319 align:start position:0%
happened there so I I do want to say
 
00:50:43.970 --> 00:50:43.980 align:start position:0%
that uh uh when we refer a built interim
 
00:50:46.609 --> 00:50:46.619 align:start position:0%
study and folks take a lot of time and
 
00:50:48.890 --> 00:50:48.900 align:start position:0%
meet several times and come up with a
 
00:50:51.470 --> 00:50:51.480 align:start position:0%
recommendation I would hope that we
 
00:50:55.069 --> 00:50:55.079 align:start position:0%
would honor or or uh respect the interim
 
00:50:58.970 --> 00:50:58.980 align:start position:0%
study uh committee's work uh otherwise
 
00:51:01.849 --> 00:51:01.859 align:start position:0%
uh why would someone want to be on uh
 
00:51:04.549 --> 00:51:04.559 align:start position:0%
interim study and again uh it's a very
 
00:51:07.069 --> 00:51:07.079 align:start position:0%
very short Bill all it does is it just
 
00:51:07.079 --> 00:51:08.210 align:start position:0%
very short Bill all it does is it just
asks

00:51:08.210 --> 00:51:08.220 align:start position:0%
asks
 
00:51:11.270 --> 00:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
uh districts to share what they do if
 
00:51:13.490 --> 00:51:13.500 align:start position:0%
anything for a essentially best
 
00:51:17.030 --> 00:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
practices folder to share good ideas and
 
00:51:18.829 --> 00:51:18.839 align:start position:0%
that's about it there is no requirement
 
00:51:22.270 --> 00:51:22.280 align:start position:0%
to analyze data uh it's just basically
 
00:51:26.410 --> 00:51:26.420 align:start position:0%
sharing uh ideas for a best practices
 
00:51:33.950 --> 00:51:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:38.210 --> 00:51:38.220 align:start position:0%
no I just concur with uh representative
 
00:51:38.220 --> 00:51:39.950 align:start position:0%
no I just concur with uh representative
okay

00:51:39.950 --> 00:51:39.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:51:42.829 --> 00:51:42.839 align:start position:0%
any further discussion
 
00:51:50.770 --> 00:51:50.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:54.410 --> 00:51:54.420 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chair
 
00:51:57.290 --> 00:51:57.300 align:start position:0%
um when this when this was uh presented
 
00:51:59.809 --> 00:51:59.819 align:start position:0%
to us two years ago I supported it I'm
 
00:52:02.270 --> 00:52:02.280 align:start position:0%
not going to do that this time the
 
00:52:03.710 --> 00:52:03.720 align:start position:0%
reason for that it's not because I'm
 
00:52:06.890 --> 00:52:06.900 align:start position:0%
against the gifted and talented is that
 
00:52:10.190 --> 00:52:10.200 align:start position:0%
it it has no purpose uh we don't know
 
00:52:11.890 --> 00:52:11.900 align:start position:0%
where are you and this is going to land
 
00:52:14.990 --> 00:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
in the Department of Education it's
 
00:52:17.450 --> 00:52:17.460 align:start position:0%
going to be put into a file nothing's
 
00:52:19.430 --> 00:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
going to happen to it it's another
 
00:52:22.190 --> 00:52:22.200 align:start position:0%
activity that school districts will have
 
00:52:23.210 --> 00:52:23.220 align:start position:0%
to have
 
00:52:25.790 --> 00:52:25.800 align:start position:0%
there's no really definition of what is
 
00:52:28.730 --> 00:52:28.740 align:start position:0%
a gifted and talented student I mean we
 
00:52:30.770 --> 00:52:30.780 align:start position:0%
talked about this uh in the hearing in
 
00:52:32.690 --> 00:52:32.700 align:start position:0%
the hearing when we talked about you
 
00:52:34.609 --> 00:52:34.619 align:start position:0%
know does this mean that the star
 
00:52:37.069 --> 00:52:37.079 align:start position:0%
athlete should be a gifted and talented
 
00:52:40.970 --> 00:52:40.980 align:start position:0%
should that be put in there uh should a
 
00:52:44.510 --> 00:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
an extremely gifted musician be put in
 
00:52:47.150 --> 00:52:47.160 align:start position:0%
there there's no definition to what this
 
00:52:49.910 --> 00:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
is all about and so until we have I
 
00:52:52.370 --> 00:52:52.380 align:start position:0%
think a further clarification of exactly
 
00:52:54.650 --> 00:52:54.660 align:start position:0%
the intent of the file
 
00:52:56.750 --> 00:52:56.760 align:start position:0%
and give some guidance to school
 
00:52:59.270 --> 00:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
districts as it relates to what is
 
00:53:01.970 --> 00:53:01.980 align:start position:0%
gifted and talented I just think that
 
00:53:05.569 --> 00:53:05.579 align:start position:0%
this is just another busy work for
 
00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
school districts to send to the
 
00:53:09.170 --> 00:53:09.180 align:start position:0%
Department of Education that will really
 
00:53:11.329 --> 00:53:11.339 align:start position:0%
land in the file of indecision and
 
00:53:13.430 --> 00:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
inaction and I don't think it's
 
00:53:15.770 --> 00:53:15.780 align:start position:0%
necessary thank you
 
00:53:15.780 --> 00:53:28.010 align:start position:0%
necessary thank you
previously

00:53:28.010 --> 00:53:28.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:31.309 --> 00:53:31.319 align:start position:0%
um no no go with somebody else I'm sorry
 
00:53:31.319 --> 00:53:33.109 align:start position:0%
um no no go with somebody else I'm sorry
um

00:53:33.109 --> 00:53:33.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:33.119 --> 00:53:34.309 align:start position:0%
um
yes

00:53:34.309 --> 00:53:34.319 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:53:34.319 --> 00:53:34.970 align:start position:0%
yes
um

00:53:34.970 --> 00:53:34.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:37.069 --> 00:53:37.079 align:start position:0%
I don't see a problem with the school
 
00:53:40.609 --> 00:53:40.619 align:start position:0%
deciding who is talented or gifted and
 
00:53:42.170 --> 00:53:42.180 align:start position:0%
if they decide that a particularly
 
00:53:45.170 --> 00:53:45.180 align:start position:0%
talented musician is talented and they
 
00:53:48.349 --> 00:53:48.359 align:start position:0%
came up with a way of helping that child
 
00:53:51.349 --> 00:53:51.359 align:start position:0%
to become the best they could be by
 
00:53:54.309 --> 00:53:54.319 align:start position:0%
whatever means they did whether somehow
 
00:53:57.710 --> 00:53:57.720 align:start position:0%
finding a an orchestra for them to play
 
00:54:00.650 --> 00:54:00.660 align:start position:0%
with or whatever and they send that so
 
00:54:02.930 --> 00:54:02.940 align:start position:0%
that other schools know hey this is what
 
00:54:05.210 --> 00:54:05.220 align:start position:0%
we did and this really helped this kid
 
00:54:07.309 --> 00:54:07.319 align:start position:0%
so maybe you want to consider doing the
 
00:54:09.290 --> 00:54:09.300 align:start position:0%
same thing I don't see a problem with
 
00:54:09.300 --> 00:54:14.870 align:start position:0%
same thing I don't see a problem with
that

00:54:14.870 --> 00:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:18.170 --> 00:54:18.180 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair uh having worked
 
00:54:20.030 --> 00:54:20.040 align:start position:0%
at the Department of Education for 41
 
00:54:24.170 --> 00:54:24.180 align:start position:0%
years uh I I have to tell you that this
 
00:54:26.210 --> 00:54:26.220 align:start position:0%
particular approach to an educational
 
00:54:30.410 --> 00:54:30.420 align:start position:0%
issue of school districts summarizing in
 
00:54:33.349 --> 00:54:33.359 align:start position:0%
narrow using their own definitions and
 
00:54:35.089 --> 00:54:35.099 align:start position:0%
sending a report to the Department of
 
00:54:37.549 --> 00:54:37.559 align:start position:0%
Education which goes into a file folder
 
00:54:41.329 --> 00:54:41.339 align:start position:0%
or in this case maybe onto a website uh
 
00:54:45.950 --> 00:54:45.960 align:start position:0%
does a little if nothing to focus on the
 
00:54:47.870 --> 00:54:47.880 align:start position:0%
particular issue here around gifted and
 
00:54:50.990 --> 00:54:51.000 align:start position:0%
talented uh as far as I'm concerned this
 
00:54:53.990 --> 00:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
is like a feel-good bill and it gets us
 
00:54:57.589 --> 00:54:57.599 align:start position:0%
to saying this is better than nothing if
 
00:54:59.930 --> 00:54:59.940 align:start position:0%
we really are serious about this issue
 
00:55:02.329 --> 00:55:02.339 align:start position:0%
and helping school districts approach it
 
00:55:06.890 --> 00:55:06.900 align:start position:0%
we would be uh supporting staff a staff
 
00:55:08.569 --> 00:55:08.579 align:start position:0%
person at the Department of Education
 
00:55:11.450 --> 00:55:11.460 align:start position:0%
that they have in the past who was
 
00:55:13.069 --> 00:55:13.079 align:start position:0%
significant in helping districts
 
00:55:15.470 --> 00:55:15.480 align:start position:0%
approach this particular issue so I'll
 
00:55:23.150 --> 00:55:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:25.250 --> 00:55:25.260 align:start position:0%
yeah my thinking is a little bit
 
00:55:27.349 --> 00:55:27.359 align:start position:0%
different on this and the reason I
 
00:55:28.849 --> 00:55:28.859 align:start position:0%
supported it
 
00:55:31.790 --> 00:55:31.800 align:start position:0%
I have had uh
 
00:55:34.970 --> 00:55:34.980 align:start position:0%
principles in Manchester approach me
 
00:55:39.109 --> 00:55:39.119 align:start position:0%
uh especially one who continuously has
 
00:55:41.750 --> 00:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
said when are we going to do something
 
00:55:44.450 --> 00:55:44.460 align:start position:0%
at the state level about getting to
 
00:55:44.460 --> 00:55:46.450 align:start position:0%
at the state level about getting to
students

00:55:46.450 --> 00:55:46.460 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:55:51.770 --> 00:55:51.780 align:start position:0%
and the only reason that I think this is
 
00:55:54.589 --> 00:55:54.599 align:start position:0%
good is a
 
00:55:57.170 --> 00:55:57.180 align:start position:0%
it's it's a beginning
 
00:56:01.190 --> 00:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
what it would do is submit reports which
 
00:56:05.569 --> 00:56:05.579 align:start position:0%
would be placed on file and I can see in
 
00:56:09.410 --> 00:56:09.420 align:start position:0%
the next legislative session or in in
 
00:56:11.390 --> 00:56:11.400 align:start position:0%
the next term
 
00:56:14.750 --> 00:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
Someone putting in a bill that will
 
00:56:19.089 --> 00:56:19.099 align:start position:0%
expand on uh the gifted and talented
 
00:56:23.290 --> 00:56:23.300 align:start position:0%
aspect of student achievement
 
00:56:26.569 --> 00:56:26.579 align:start position:0%
and at that point someone could say well
 
00:56:29.150 --> 00:56:29.160 align:start position:0%
do we have any idea of what anybody has
 
00:56:33.170 --> 00:56:33.180 align:start position:0%
been doing in in the state about this
 
00:56:36.710 --> 00:56:36.720 align:start position:0%
you can say well actually we have an
 
00:56:42.049 --> 00:56:42.059 align:start position:0%
informal file that was bio uh because of
 
00:56:46.370 --> 00:56:46.380 align:start position:0%
legislation that was passed in 2021
 
00:56:52.450 --> 00:56:52.460 align:start position:0%
that has you know a sporadic uh uh
 
00:56:55.309 --> 00:56:55.319 align:start position:0%
reporting of what's been done around the
 
00:56:55.319 --> 00:56:56.210 align:start position:0%
reporting of what's been done around the
state

00:56:56.210 --> 00:56:56.220 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:56:59.450 --> 00:56:59.460 align:start position:0%
so we can start with that and just get
 
00:57:02.630 --> 00:57:02.640 align:start position:0%
an idea about what's going on around the
 
00:57:05.990 --> 00:57:06.000 align:start position:0%
state and work from there so that's my
 
00:57:08.230 --> 00:57:08.240 align:start position:0%
way of thinking about it it's probably
 
00:57:11.630 --> 00:57:11.640 align:start position:0%
here we go my favorite word demented but
 
00:57:13.490 --> 00:57:13.500 align:start position:0%
I I think this is
 
00:57:17.569 --> 00:57:17.579 align:start position:0%
um just uh something to say well you
 
00:57:20.329 --> 00:57:20.339 align:start position:0%
know something is there let's build on
 
00:57:23.089 --> 00:57:23.099 align:start position:0%
it and and that's my field because I
 
00:57:25.910 --> 00:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
don't think at this point uh with the
 
00:57:27.589 --> 00:57:27.599 align:start position:0%
cobit and all the other things that have
 
00:57:28.730 --> 00:57:28.740 align:start position:0%
been going on
 
00:57:31.190 --> 00:57:31.200 align:start position:0%
uh we don't need to throw something else
 
00:57:34.130 --> 00:57:34.140 align:start position:0%
out there right now but I think this is
 
00:57:42.710 --> 00:57:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:44.870 --> 00:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I'd just like to
 
00:57:47.809 --> 00:57:47.819 align:start position:0%
add to in our school district in the
 
00:57:51.170 --> 00:57:51.180 align:start position:0%
past we've sent our we'll say gifted
 
00:57:53.089 --> 00:57:53.099 align:start position:0%
math students down to the elementary
 
00:57:56.210 --> 00:57:56.220 align:start position:0%
school to help the different the
 
00:57:57.530 --> 00:57:57.540 align:start position:0%
elementary school
 
00:58:00.290 --> 00:58:00.300 align:start position:0%
I mean that kind of thing might like to
 
00:58:03.170 --> 00:58:03.180 align:start position:0%
share also in the case of athletes of
 
00:58:05.510 --> 00:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
course why not if you have a gifted
 
00:58:08.030 --> 00:58:08.040 align:start position:0%
soccer player in high school that's
 
00:58:10.730 --> 00:58:10.740 align:start position:0%
really great why not send to the Middle
 
00:58:14.150 --> 00:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
School to help that soccer team I see
 
00:58:17.690 --> 00:58:17.700 align:start position:0%
nothing wrong with that at all uh
 
00:58:20.329 --> 00:58:20.339 align:start position:0%
school and schools can share their own
 
00:58:22.670 --> 00:58:22.680 align:start position:0%
personal experience we did this we did
 
00:58:24.849 --> 00:58:24.859 align:start position:0%
this there's the principles Association
 
00:58:27.589 --> 00:58:27.599 align:start position:0%
that they that can be used for sharing
 
00:58:29.569 --> 00:58:29.579 align:start position:0%
all this information there's all kinds
 
00:58:31.730 --> 00:58:31.740 align:start position:0%
of teachers associations that
 
00:58:34.730 --> 00:58:34.740 align:start position:0%
that exists that these these things can
 
00:58:36.230 --> 00:58:36.240 align:start position:0%
be shared and the school board
 
00:58:38.809 --> 00:58:38.819 align:start position:0%
Associates all these things can somehow
 
00:58:41.569 --> 00:58:41.579 align:start position:0%
be shared not just the doe school
 
00:58:43.130 --> 00:58:43.140 align:start position:0%
districts can share with their own
 
00:58:46.609 --> 00:58:46.619 align:start position:0%
colleagues across the state so it's
 
00:58:49.549 --> 00:58:49.559 align:start position:0%
being done now and I I see no problem
 
00:58:53.809 --> 00:58:53.819 align:start position:0%
with athletes musicians actors or
 
00:58:57.890 --> 00:58:57.900 align:start position:0%
anything that's gifted honest you know
 
00:58:57.900 --> 00:58:58.490 align:start position:0%
anything that's gifted honest you know
um

00:58:58.490 --> 00:58:58.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:01.309 --> 00:59:01.319 align:start position:0%
you know going going to from one school
 
00:59:05.150 --> 00:59:05.160 align:start position:0%
to another helping so even across
 
00:59:07.730 --> 00:59:07.740 align:start position:0%
districts if you want to do that so I
 
00:59:09.710 --> 00:59:09.720 align:start position:0%
see no problem with this is I think it's
 
00:59:11.750 --> 00:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
great let's find out what other school
 
00:59:14.210 --> 00:59:14.220 align:start position:0%
districts are doing and share that
 
00:59:14.220 --> 00:59:19.730 align:start position:0%
districts are doing and share that
information

00:59:19.730 --> 00:59:19.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:21.470 --> 00:59:21.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:59:23.750 --> 00:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
I think at the high school level uh
 
00:59:25.430 --> 00:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of things for gifted
 
00:59:28.309 --> 00:59:28.319 align:start position:0%
athletes and gifted math students AP
 
00:59:30.950 --> 00:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
courses and different times of
 
00:59:33.530 --> 00:59:33.540 align:start position:0%
competition for them to to participate
 
00:59:33.540 --> 00:59:34.309 align:start position:0%
competition for them to to participate
in

00:59:34.309 --> 00:59:34.319 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:59:37.370 --> 00:59:37.380 align:start position:0%
we um in my school district we had a
 
00:59:39.349 --> 00:59:39.359 align:start position:0%
gifted and talented program for the
 
00:59:40.849 --> 00:59:40.859 align:start position:0%
elementary and middle school where I
 
00:59:43.490 --> 00:59:43.500 align:start position:0%
think it's really really needed
 
00:59:46.630 --> 00:59:46.640 align:start position:0%
it was sometimes there and sometimes not
 
00:59:49.130 --> 00:59:49.140 align:start position:0%
and the biggest thing biggest difference
 
00:59:51.470 --> 00:59:51.480 align:start position:0%
in it was not that we didn't have people
 
00:59:54.829 --> 00:59:54.839 align:start position:0%
who had ideas about how to run this or
 
00:59:57.890 --> 00:59:57.900 align:start position:0%
what to do or to send students down uh
 
01:00:01.130 --> 01:00:01.140 align:start position:0%
to the elementary school and help out it
 
01:00:03.049 --> 01:00:03.059 align:start position:0%
was money and time
 
01:00:06.650 --> 01:00:06.660 align:start position:0%
uh that was the big issue and I think it
 
01:00:08.510 --> 01:00:08.520 align:start position:0%
will always be the big issue for public
 
01:00:11.030 --> 01:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
schools when testing came in required
 
01:00:13.250 --> 01:00:13.260 align:start position:0%
testing and No Child Left Behind came in
 
01:00:13.260 --> 01:00:15.530 align:start position:0%
testing and No Child Left Behind came in
when

01:00:15.530 --> 01:00:15.540 align:start position:0%
when
 
01:00:19.010 --> 01:00:19.020 align:start position:0%
school funding started dropping uh
 
01:00:21.170 --> 01:00:21.180 align:start position:0%
gifted and talented was one of the first
 
01:00:26.390 --> 01:00:26.400 align:start position:0%
programs to go so I support the programs
 
01:00:28.970 --> 01:00:28.980 align:start position:0%
but I don't think this is the way to
 
01:00:31.010 --> 01:00:31.020 align:start position:0%
encourage schools to do them the the
 
01:00:33.470 --> 01:00:33.480 align:start position:0%
schools that don't have them probably
 
01:00:35.150 --> 01:00:35.160 align:start position:0%
can't afford them and don't have the
 
01:00:39.109 --> 01:00:39.119 align:start position:0%
time within their schedule to meet all
 
01:00:42.170 --> 01:00:42.180 align:start position:0%
the requirements that we put on them and
 
01:00:44.809 --> 01:00:44.819 align:start position:0%
then offer this kind of program so I'll
 
01:00:46.549 --> 01:00:46.559 align:start position:0%
be voting no against
 
01:00:48.950 --> 01:00:48.960 align:start position:0%
um this particular piece of legislation
 
01:00:52.730 --> 01:00:52.740 align:start position:0%
but know that I firmly support uh gifted
 
01:00:54.829 --> 01:00:54.839 align:start position:0%
and talented or a similar type of
 
01:00:56.329 --> 01:00:56.339 align:start position:0%
program in the elementary and middle
 
01:00:58.309 --> 01:00:58.319 align:start position:0%
school thank you
 
01:01:01.490 --> 01:01:01.500 align:start position:0%
let's do it I've worked in a good path
 
01:01:03.650 --> 01:01:03.660 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um just a quick thing
 
01:01:05.630 --> 01:01:05.640 align:start position:0%
I listening to representative Bowen are
 
01:01:07.490 --> 01:01:07.500 align:start position:0%
talking about the associations and the
 
01:01:10.010 --> 01:01:10.020 align:start position:0%
share experiences I concur with them 100
 
01:01:11.930 --> 01:01:11.940 align:start position:0%
and I think they're that all those
 
01:01:13.609 --> 01:01:13.619 align:start position:0%
associations are an opportunity for
 
01:01:16.609 --> 01:01:16.619 align:start position:0%
schools to share uh collectively however
 
01:01:19.670 --> 01:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
when you add a requirement uh to every
 
01:01:22.309 --> 01:01:22.319 align:start position:0%
single school superintendent to submit
 
01:01:25.370 --> 01:01:25.380 align:start position:0%
another report into doe
 
01:01:27.349 --> 01:01:27.359 align:start position:0%
um that's a whole different task and and
 
01:01:29.809 --> 01:01:29.819 align:start position:0%
I don't see much value in that uh where
 
01:01:31.309 --> 01:01:31.319 align:start position:0%
there's no there's no current direction
 
01:01:32.569 --> 01:01:32.579 align:start position:0%
on what's going to happen to those
 
01:01:35.089 --> 01:01:35.099 align:start position:0%
things but the utilizing the
 
01:01:37.130 --> 01:01:37.140 align:start position:0%
associations the Teachers Association
 
01:01:39.530 --> 01:01:39.540 align:start position:0%
the afd the Nea the school bus
 
01:01:41.510 --> 01:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
Association that's terrific that's all
 
01:01:43.370 --> 01:01:43.380 align:start position:0%
voluntary and now we just add another
 
01:01:45.410 --> 01:01:45.420 align:start position:0%
task and a tough time of year
 
01:01:46.730 --> 01:01:46.740 align:start position:0%
um that has no substance to Local
 
01:01:49.970 --> 01:01:49.980 align:start position:0%
Schools superintendents thank you thank
 
01:01:52.670 --> 01:01:52.680 align:start position:0%
you uh representative Leon uh thank you
 
01:01:54.470 --> 01:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
01:01:57.170 --> 01:01:57.180 align:start position:0%
if it's such a one of my concerns is
 
01:01:59.870 --> 01:01:59.880 align:start position:0%
that right now lower lower aged children
 
01:02:03.049 --> 01:02:03.059 align:start position:0%
those in elementary school may not be
 
01:02:04.970 --> 01:02:04.980 align:start position:0%
may not have the same opportunities to
 
01:02:07.309 --> 01:02:07.319 align:start position:0%
move forward because if a teacher or the
 
01:02:08.990 --> 01:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
school is concerned that there may not
 
01:02:11.329 --> 01:02:11.339 align:start position:0%
be educational opportunities for them
 
01:02:12.950 --> 01:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
once they reach the high school level if
 
01:02:14.750 --> 01:02:14.760 align:start position:0%
they accelerate too much in the earlier
 
01:02:17.270 --> 01:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
grades they may be concerned about
 
01:02:19.549 --> 01:02:19.559 align:start position:0%
offering further enrichment this is an
 
01:02:21.829 --> 01:02:21.839 align:start position:0%
area where if every teacher who is
 
01:02:23.510 --> 01:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
concerned about this is contacting the
 
01:02:25.730 --> 01:02:25.740 align:start position:0%
superintendent that's going to take more
 
01:02:27.470 --> 01:02:27.480 align:start position:0%
time than allowing them simply to
 
01:02:29.089 --> 01:02:29.099 align:start position:0%
acquire the Department of Education or
 
01:02:31.670 --> 01:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
simply query the superintendent's office
 
01:02:33.710 --> 01:02:33.720 align:start position:0%
to find out what their individual school
 
01:02:36.589 --> 01:02:36.599 align:start position:0%
policy is this is an area where we need
 
01:02:38.270 --> 01:02:38.280 align:start position:0%
to make sure that our young minds are
 
01:02:40.849 --> 01:02:40.859 align:start position:0%
challenged because young minds that
 
01:02:43.130 --> 01:02:43.140 align:start position:0%
aren't challenged become disruptive and
 
01:02:44.990 --> 01:02:45.000 align:start position:0%
it is a lot better to make sure that
 
01:02:46.490 --> 01:02:46.500 align:start position:0%
they can get some new opportunities
 
01:02:48.589 --> 01:02:48.599 align:start position:0%
pursue this and make sure that the
 
01:02:49.670 --> 01:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
teachers aren't afraid that they're
 
01:02:51.470 --> 01:02:51.480 align:start position:0%
going to get topped out in calculus
 
01:02:53.870 --> 01:02:53.880 align:start position:0%
because they're not aware that that
 
01:02:55.670 --> 01:02:55.680 align:start position:0%
there's a arrangement for some of these
 
01:02:57.289 --> 01:02:57.299 align:start position:0%
more accelerated students to take some
 
01:02:58.910 --> 01:02:58.920 align:start position:0%
classes at the college level if they
 
01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
really do excel in math
 
01:03:01.990 --> 01:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:03:04.430 --> 01:03:04.440 align:start position:0%
yeah I'd like to point out that the rest
 
01:03:06.049 --> 01:03:06.059 align:start position:0%
of the world rigorous that promotes and
 
01:03:07.910 --> 01:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
cultivates gifting students I think we
 
01:03:10.069 --> 01:03:10.079 align:start position:0%
need to get started on that
 
01:03:15.650 --> 01:03:15.660 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:18.049 --> 01:03:18.059 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh just a couple of
 
01:03:20.510 --> 01:03:20.520 align:start position:0%
questions I was wondering if um it's a
 
01:03:23.270 --> 01:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
small district and it makes a report and
 
01:03:25.490 --> 01:03:25.500 align:start position:0%
it becomes quite clear from the report
 
01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:27.470 align:start position:0%
it becomes quite clear from the report
who

01:03:27.470 --> 01:03:27.480 align:start position:0%
who
 
01:03:31.250 --> 01:03:31.260 align:start position:0%
is being denominated gifted in whatever
 
01:03:36.849 --> 01:03:36.859 align:start position:0%
category do parents have the ability to
 
01:03:39.950 --> 01:03:39.960 align:start position:0%
uh appeal and claim that their child is
 
01:03:43.490 --> 01:03:43.500 align:start position:0%
gifted and ought to be included as well
 
01:03:46.549 --> 01:03:46.559 align:start position:0%
um and I ask that because right now uh
 
01:03:48.470 --> 01:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
in the report as it stands or in the
 
01:03:51.890 --> 01:03:51.900 align:start position:0%
legislation proposed as stands there are
 
01:03:53.510 --> 01:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
no standards
 
01:03:55.910 --> 01:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
there's nothing that offers any
 
01:03:58.370 --> 01:03:58.380 align:start position:0%
definitions and so I was just thinking I
 
01:04:01.190 --> 01:04:01.200 align:start position:0%
was reading how um my high school local
 
01:04:03.770 --> 01:04:03.780 align:start position:0%
high school Conan High School the girls
 
01:04:05.510 --> 01:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
basketball team just won their second
 
01:04:08.329 --> 01:04:08.339 align:start position:0%
straight state championship second
 
01:04:11.809 --> 01:04:11.819 align:start position:0%
straight undefeated season uh do you
 
01:04:14.150 --> 01:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
name one person as gifted on that team
 
01:04:17.450 --> 01:04:17.460 align:start position:0%
or do you name the entire team as gifted
 
01:04:19.370 --> 01:04:19.380 align:start position:0%
um and if you name one person or it's
 
01:04:22.190 --> 01:04:22.200 align:start position:0%
clear that one person is denominated as
 
01:04:23.510 --> 01:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
gifted because again it's a small
 
01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:24.530 align:start position:0%
gifted because again it's a small
District

01:04:24.530 --> 01:04:24.540 align:start position:0%
District
 
01:04:25.849 --> 01:04:25.859 align:start position:0%
um and in the report it could be pretty
 
01:04:28.250 --> 01:04:28.260 align:start position:0%
clear as to who it is
 
01:04:30.289 --> 01:04:30.299 align:start position:0%
um do the other parents of the girls the
 
01:04:32.450 --> 01:04:32.460 align:start position:0%
other girls have a right of appeal to
 
01:04:34.789 --> 01:04:34.799 align:start position:0%
say well my child is gifted as well
 
01:04:36.950 --> 01:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
um and contributed to the team
 
01:04:38.809 --> 01:04:38.819 align:start position:0%
um and so I'm just wondering how that
 
01:04:40.670 --> 01:04:40.680 align:start position:0%
would be handled thank you
 
01:04:42.770 --> 01:04:42.780 align:start position:0%
that's a question for the sponsor by the
 
01:04:45.410 --> 01:04:45.420 align:start position:0%
way okay uh we'll follow him in a second
 
01:04:45.420 --> 01:04:49.190 align:start position:0%
way okay uh we'll follow him in a second
uh

01:04:49.190 --> 01:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:52.190 --> 01:04:52.200 align:start position:0%
yes I'm supportive of this bill and
 
01:04:55.910 --> 01:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
partly because I didn't think we should
 
01:04:58.190 --> 01:04:58.200 align:start position:0%
offer a
 
01:05:01.609 --> 01:05:01.619 align:start position:0%
um requirement at this stage I noted
 
01:05:03.710 --> 01:05:03.720 align:start position:0%
when their schools were all reporting on
 
01:05:05.750 --> 01:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
the what they did and what they'd when
 
01:05:08.630 --> 01:05:08.640 align:start position:0%
they spoke to us about various Things No
 
01:05:11.690 --> 01:05:11.700 align:start position:0%
One mentioned the gifted at all
 
01:05:14.089 --> 01:05:14.099 align:start position:0%
and I remember when my children were in
 
01:05:16.130 --> 01:05:16.140 align:start position:0%
school there was a great deal of
 
01:05:19.490 --> 01:05:19.500 align:start position:0%
difficulty in getting things that got
 
01:05:22.670 --> 01:05:22.680 align:start position:0%
very bright perhaps overactive but
 
01:05:25.430 --> 01:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
nonetheless kids engaged in things that
 
01:05:27.170 --> 01:05:27.180 align:start position:0%
kept them out of trouble
 
01:05:29.390 --> 01:05:29.400 align:start position:0%
it was all kinds of support as in
 
01:05:31.490 --> 01:05:31.500 align:start position:0%
Varsity athletes and all that for
 
01:05:34.549 --> 01:05:34.559 align:start position:0%
athletics The Talented toe
 
01:05:37.130 --> 01:05:37.140 align:start position:0%
but there was nothing for the talented
 
01:05:39.650 --> 01:05:39.660 align:start position:0%
kid it was nothing for the really bright
 
01:05:42.170 --> 01:05:42.180 align:start position:0%
kid and this was a
 
01:05:44.809 --> 01:05:44.819 align:start position:0%
shall we say undemanding and keep in
 
01:05:47.750 --> 01:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
mind I'm a former English Prof so adding
 
01:05:49.730 --> 01:05:49.740 align:start position:0%
one essay to someone's life is not what
 
01:05:52.609 --> 01:05:52.619 align:start position:0%
I call an onerous requirement
 
01:05:54.710 --> 01:05:54.720 align:start position:0%
you may have suspected that already when
 
01:05:56.950 --> 01:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
you were in college but nonetheless
 
01:05:59.690 --> 01:05:59.700 align:start position:0%
it's just not that difficult to say well
 
01:06:01.250 --> 01:06:01.260 align:start position:0%
we're doing this and this and this and
 
01:06:03.470 --> 01:06:03.480 align:start position:0%
this and this and we're having some
 
01:06:05.390 --> 01:06:05.400 align:start position:0%
success with two of them and not so much
 
01:06:07.789 --> 01:06:07.799 align:start position:0%
with the other all we're asking for is
 
01:06:10.130 --> 01:06:10.140 align:start position:0%
is anybody paying attention
 
01:06:12.710 --> 01:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
because the next step is then to move to
 
01:06:14.930 --> 01:06:14.940 align:start position:0%
a requirement which is over the
 
01:06:17.089 --> 01:06:17.099 align:start position:0%
requirements that representative lay and
 
01:06:19.010 --> 01:06:19.020 align:start position:0%
others have suggested that a very
 
01:06:21.770 --> 01:06:21.780 align:start position:0%
specific and qualify and we work out a
 
01:06:23.990 --> 01:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
definition that excludes the athletes
 
01:06:26.089 --> 01:06:26.099 align:start position:0%
because they have things taking care of
 
01:06:26.099 --> 01:06:27.049 align:start position:0%
because they have things taking care of
them

01:06:27.049 --> 01:06:27.059 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:06:29.150 --> 01:06:29.160 align:start position:0%
but they are the other kids the kids
 
01:06:31.130 --> 01:06:31.140 align:start position:0%
that watch them being given sweaters
 
01:06:33.589 --> 01:06:33.599 align:start position:0%
every year and so what do I get
 
01:06:35.569 --> 01:06:35.579 align:start position:0%
I don't get a sweater if I'm good in
 
01:06:38.990 --> 01:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
Latin I don't get anything I'm chopped
 
01:06:41.710 --> 01:06:41.720 align:start position:0%
change chop soup whatever
 
01:06:45.770 --> 01:06:45.780 align:start position:0%
nothing so yeah some jump change and
 
01:06:48.710 --> 01:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
Chopsticks and uh chopped liver I guess
 
01:06:51.410 --> 01:06:51.420 align:start position:0%
it is but at any rate
 
01:06:54.529 --> 01:06:54.539 align:start position:0%
the point being that this is an
 
01:06:57.770 --> 01:06:57.780 align:start position:0%
invitation to sort of alert them that
 
01:06:59.450 --> 01:06:59.460 align:start position:0%
we're concerned about this
 
01:07:02.270 --> 01:07:02.280 align:start position:0%
it doesn't require anything much of them
 
01:07:04.130 --> 01:07:04.140 align:start position:0%
a simple
 
01:07:07.849 --> 01:07:07.859 align:start position:0%
very short in-class essay would suffice
 
01:07:10.250 --> 01:07:10.260 align:start position:0%
but we got nothing
 
01:07:13.609 --> 01:07:13.619 align:start position:0%
this is better than nothing
 
01:07:16.750 --> 01:07:16.760 align:start position:0%
that's my point
 
01:07:19.490 --> 01:07:19.500 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr chair uh and thank you
 
01:07:22.010 --> 01:07:22.020 align:start position:0%
representative Ford for your uh your
 
01:07:25.250 --> 01:07:25.260 align:start position:0%
comments uh I I can tell that you you
 
01:07:27.829 --> 01:07:27.839 align:start position:0%
can sense the intent behind this uh yeah
 
01:07:29.270 --> 01:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
I do understand briefly to
 
01:07:31.190 --> 01:07:31.200 align:start position:0%
representative lay and also to uh
 
01:07:34.190 --> 01:07:34.200 align:start position:0%
representative Milo's earlier comments
 
01:07:37.789 --> 01:07:37.799 align:start position:0%
um by Design By Design the uh the
 
01:07:41.750 --> 01:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
warning of this bill uh describes gifted
 
01:07:43.670 --> 01:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
and talented in the broadest possible
 
01:07:47.809 --> 01:07:47.819 align:start position:0%
terms so that localities can have a
 
01:07:50.569 --> 01:07:50.579 align:start position:0%
discussion locally as to what they feel
 
01:07:54.770 --> 01:07:54.780 align:start position:0%
uh constitutes a population or students
 
01:07:57.589 --> 01:07:57.599 align:start position:0%
who are underserved and deserve some
 
01:07:58.910 --> 01:07:58.920 align:start position:0%
attention that they have not been
 
01:07:58.920 --> 01:07:59.990 align:start position:0%
attention that they have not been
getting

01:07:59.990 --> 01:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
getting
 
01:08:02.930 --> 01:08:02.940 align:start position:0%
so uh yeah by Design we we do not want
 
01:08:05.990 --> 01:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
to prescriptively tell districts uh who
 
01:08:09.829 --> 01:08:09.839 align:start position:0%
or what or who is is gifted uh should we
 
01:08:12.289 --> 01:08:12.299 align:start position:0%
leave that to the localities in terms of
 
01:08:14.510 --> 01:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
uh reporting uh it could be done by an
 
01:08:17.630 --> 01:08:17.640 align:start position:0%
email uh with an attachment uh so it's
 
01:08:20.450 --> 01:08:20.460 align:start position:0%
certainly not an onerous requirement to
 
01:08:22.789 --> 01:08:22.799 align:start position:0%
report anything
 
01:08:26.329 --> 01:08:26.339 align:start position:0%
um and the sad thing is that many
 
01:08:29.930 --> 01:08:29.940 align:start position:0%
perhaps most districts uh do nothing or
 
01:08:31.809 --> 01:08:31.819 align:start position:0%
next to nothing in this area
 
01:08:34.849 --> 01:08:34.859 align:start position:0%
uh two terms ago when we spent some time
 
01:08:36.829 --> 01:08:36.839 align:start position:0%
researching this with Jennifer four I
 
01:08:38.990 --> 01:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned this during the hearing New
 
01:08:41.749 --> 01:08:41.759 align:start position:0%
Hampshire may be very well maybe the
 
01:08:44.269 --> 01:08:44.279 align:start position:0%
worst state in the country in terms of
 
01:08:46.070 --> 01:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
what it does in terms of paying
 
01:08:48.530 --> 01:08:48.540 align:start position:0%
attention to for having programs for
 
01:08:50.809 --> 01:08:50.819 align:start position:0%
so-called gifted and talented students
 
01:08:54.709 --> 01:08:54.719 align:start position:0%
so this uh this measure is simply in the
 
01:08:57.050 --> 01:08:57.060 align:start position:0%
beauty of this measure which some folks
 
01:09:00.650 --> 01:09:00.660 align:start position:0%
have picked up on uh more than others is
 
01:09:04.249 --> 01:09:04.259 align:start position:0%
that this will require a conversation uh
 
01:09:07.490 --> 01:09:07.500 align:start position:0%
a discussion in every District in in the
 
01:09:10.550 --> 01:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
State uh where in many districts nothing
 
01:09:12.829 --> 01:09:12.839 align:start position:0%
is happening because of this legislation
 
01:09:14.510 --> 01:09:14.520 align:start position:0%
should have moved forward then there
 
01:09:17.450 --> 01:09:17.460 align:start position:0%
will be a discussion locally as to what
 
01:09:20.570 --> 01:09:20.580 align:start position:0%
is happening and the notion that the
 
01:09:23.269 --> 01:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
best practices folder At Doe will will
 
01:09:26.209 --> 01:09:26.219 align:start position:0%
go nowhere I I profoundly disagree with
 
01:09:29.150 --> 01:09:29.160 align:start position:0%
that I think once the word gets out that
 
01:09:31.130 --> 01:09:31.140 align:start position:0%
there is a so-called best practices
 
01:09:33.289 --> 01:09:33.299 align:start position:0%
folder I think there's going to be a
 
01:09:36.349 --> 01:09:36.359 align:start position:0%
wonderful sharing of ideas and energy in
 
01:09:40.070 --> 01:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
in conversation on this uh overdue
 
01:09:43.249 --> 01:09:43.259 align:start position:0%
subject so uh yeah I think that it's
 
01:09:46.309 --> 01:09:46.319 align:start position:0%
time that we take a baby step uh in this
 
01:09:48.349 --> 01:09:48.359 align:start position:0%
direction and shine a light where it
 
01:09:52.630 --> 01:09:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:56.270 --> 01:09:56.280 align:start position:0%
yes I am I would like to follow up on
 
01:09:58.430 --> 01:09:58.440 align:start position:0%
what representative Shaw said
 
01:10:01.490 --> 01:10:01.500 align:start position:0%
whenever we start any study or any law
 
01:10:04.250 --> 01:10:04.260 align:start position:0%
or anything any new bill what we hear
 
01:10:06.050 --> 01:10:06.060 align:start position:0%
all the time is well what's being done
 
01:10:06.060 --> 01:10:07.130 align:start position:0%
all the time is well what's being done
now

01:10:07.130 --> 01:10:07.140 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:10:09.229 --> 01:10:09.239 align:start position:0%
and we don't know what's being done now
 
01:10:12.350 --> 01:10:12.360 align:start position:0%
so before we can follow up on this
 
01:10:14.810 --> 01:10:14.820 align:start position:0%
before we can even if we're doing a
 
01:10:17.150 --> 01:10:17.160 align:start position:0%
study committee on this wouldn't it be
 
01:10:19.010 --> 01:10:19.020 align:start position:0%
nice for the study committee to have
 
01:10:21.169 --> 01:10:21.179 align:start position:0%
this information already as a starting
 
01:10:24.470 --> 01:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
point if we want to put a bill in in the
 
01:10:28.550 --> 01:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
future as far as what we can do for
 
01:10:30.410 --> 01:10:30.420 align:start position:0%
gifted you know the first question
 
01:10:32.570 --> 01:10:32.580 align:start position:0%
people are going to ask is well what are
 
01:10:35.870 --> 01:10:35.880 align:start position:0%
we doing now so let's do this so we know
 
01:10:37.910 --> 01:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
what we're doing now so that in the
 
01:10:40.370 --> 01:10:40.380 align:start position:0%
future when we follow up with whatever
 
01:10:42.050 --> 01:10:42.060 align:start position:0%
we're going to do we have this
 
01:10:44.149 --> 01:10:44.159 align:start position:0%
information and we're ready to go
 
01:10:46.550 --> 01:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
forward instead of having to start from
 
01:10:48.590 --> 01:10:48.600 align:start position:0%
the beginning and find out what we're
 
01:10:51.110 --> 01:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
doing now thank you thank you
 
01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:53.570 align:start position:0%
doing now thank you thank you
representative

01:10:53.570 --> 01:10:53.580 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:10:56.570 --> 01:10:56.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair So based on that I
 
01:10:57.830 --> 01:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
would argue then that you should
 
01:10:59.270 --> 01:10:59.280 align:start position:0%
establish a study committee because
 
01:11:00.709 --> 01:11:00.719 align:start position:0%
right now with the sort of information
 
01:11:02.390 --> 01:11:02.400 align:start position:0%
you're going to collect it is going to
 
01:11:05.630 --> 01:11:05.640 align:start position:0%
be well nigh useless because again you
 
01:11:07.669 --> 01:11:07.679 align:start position:0%
will have no idea what the standards are
 
01:11:10.070 --> 01:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
that that individual districts are using
 
01:11:12.050 --> 01:11:12.060 align:start position:0%
because you're not requiring or asking
 
01:11:14.450 --> 01:11:14.460 align:start position:0%
for what those standards are You're
 
01:11:16.070 --> 01:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
simply going to get a list of certain
 
01:11:18.229 --> 01:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
practices but we have no idea who
 
01:11:20.270 --> 01:11:20.280 align:start position:0%
they're applicable to how people are
 
01:11:22.250 --> 01:11:22.260 align:start position:0%
determined how people are chosen in
 
01:11:23.450 --> 01:11:23.460 align:start position:0%
different districts you're just going to
 
01:11:26.570 --> 01:11:26.580 align:start position:0%
get a list of activities and that in and
 
01:11:28.990 --> 01:11:29.000 align:start position:0%
of itself is not particularly useful
 
01:11:33.709 --> 01:11:33.719 align:start position:0%
you're collecting only a portion of the
 
01:11:36.649 --> 01:11:36.659 align:start position:0%
data that you would need to engage in a
 
01:11:38.990 --> 01:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
serious study of this issue I agree that
 
01:11:40.850 --> 01:11:40.860 align:start position:0%
the the issue needs to be studied I
 
01:11:42.649 --> 01:11:42.659 align:start position:0%
agree that I would love to see schools
 
01:11:44.689 --> 01:11:44.699 align:start position:0%
do more of this but if we're going to
 
01:11:46.490 --> 01:11:46.500 align:start position:0%
collect data collect it in a whole
 
01:11:49.910 --> 01:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
fashion okay do do do a serious
 
01:11:52.010 --> 01:11:52.020 align:start position:0%
collection not this this is just simply
 
01:11:55.070 --> 01:11:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:57.830 --> 01:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
it's going to be woefully incomplete I
 
01:11:59.209 --> 01:11:59.219 align:start position:0%
guess it's just simply the way I'll put
 
01:12:01.669 --> 01:12:01.679 align:start position:0%
it so um I think it's a it's a measure
 
01:12:04.070 --> 01:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
that feels good but I don't necessarily
 
01:12:06.290 --> 01:12:06.300 align:start position:0%
think that it will yield uh much
 
01:12:07.910 --> 01:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
particularly useful information and
 
01:12:09.229 --> 01:12:09.239 align:start position:0%
you're just going to have to go back and
 
01:12:11.390 --> 01:12:11.400 align:start position:0%
do it again if you ever want to engage
 
01:12:15.729 --> 01:12:15.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:18.890 --> 01:12:18.900 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair and uh thank you
 
01:12:20.570 --> 01:12:20.580 align:start position:0%
representative lay for your perspective
 
01:12:22.970 --> 01:12:22.980 align:start position:0%
on this I know that coming from your
 
01:12:24.890 --> 01:12:24.900 align:start position:0%
background the standards and the
 
01:12:27.770 --> 01:12:27.780 align:start position:0%
criteria are crucial for this
 
01:12:30.530 --> 01:12:30.540 align:start position:0%
I Come From Another point of view
 
01:12:32.570 --> 01:12:32.580 align:start position:0%
in the gifted program in California
 
01:12:34.430 --> 01:12:34.440 align:start position:0%
there was assumed to be a certain
 
01:12:35.870 --> 01:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
percentage of students that would be
 
01:12:38.149 --> 01:12:38.159 align:start position:0%
considered gifted there was a criteria
 
01:12:40.490 --> 01:12:40.500 align:start position:0%
based on test scores and they limited
 
01:12:42.169 --> 01:12:42.179 align:start position:0%
how many students could be tested both
 
01:12:44.870 --> 01:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
in the high socio economic schools and
 
01:12:47.510 --> 01:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
in the low socioeconomic schools when
 
01:12:49.430 --> 01:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
those when more children were allowed to
 
01:12:51.530 --> 01:12:51.540 align:start position:0%
test they found that more children were
 
01:12:53.330 --> 01:12:53.340 align:start position:0%
performing at the gifted level however
 
01:12:54.950 --> 01:12:54.960 align:start position:0%
that had been suppressed because they
 
01:12:56.630 --> 01:12:56.640 align:start position:0%
assumed that only a certain percentage
 
01:12:59.209 --> 01:12:59.219 align:start position:0%
truly were gifted right now if we
 
01:13:00.950 --> 01:13:00.960 align:start position:0%
address this without those standards
 
01:13:03.890 --> 01:13:03.900 align:start position:0%
without those criteria we don't need to
 
01:13:06.229 --> 01:13:06.239 align:start position:0%
have something that is very costly or
 
01:13:08.209 --> 01:13:08.219 align:start position:0%
very time consuming if we encourage
 
01:13:09.770 --> 01:13:09.780 align:start position:0%
these children whose parents think that
 
01:13:11.149 --> 01:13:11.159 align:start position:0%
they're gifted or the children think
 
01:13:13.669 --> 01:13:13.679 align:start position:0%
that they're gifted to
 
01:13:16.250 --> 01:13:16.260 align:start position:0%
to challenge themselves to perhaps take
 
01:13:19.910 --> 01:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
on work maybe let them take the textbook
 
01:13:22.250 --> 01:13:22.260 align:start position:0%
from the next year home and take a look
 
01:13:24.470 --> 01:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
at it and see what they can do maybe
 
01:13:27.050 --> 01:13:27.060 align:start position:0%
encourage them to read outside of their
 
01:13:29.330 --> 01:13:29.340 align:start position:0%
reading level in the month write some
 
01:13:31.550 --> 01:13:31.560 align:start position:0%
reports in their spare time children
 
01:13:33.709 --> 01:13:33.719 align:start position:0%
children love to learn and we need to
 
01:13:35.689 --> 01:13:35.699 align:start position:0%
make sure that we are not teaching that
 
01:13:37.610 --> 01:13:37.620 align:start position:0%
love of learning out of them
 
01:13:40.010 --> 01:13:40.020 align:start position:0%
right if they can be challenged and they
 
01:13:41.330 --> 01:13:41.340 align:start position:0%
can find those subjects that interest
 
01:13:43.970 --> 01:13:43.980 align:start position:0%
them it's amazing how quickly Children
 
01:13:46.130 --> 01:13:46.140 align:start position:0%
of the children can progress both those
 
01:13:48.229 --> 01:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
that are on the gifted spectrum and
 
01:13:50.090 --> 01:13:50.100 align:start position:0%
those that we don't really view as
 
01:13:52.189 --> 01:13:52.199 align:start position:0%
gifted if we can challenge these
 
01:13:54.590 --> 01:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
students if we can see what happens when
 
01:13:57.050 --> 01:13:57.060 align:start position:0%
we give them the opportunity to learn at
 
01:13:59.930 --> 01:13:59.940 align:start position:0%
their own pace uh ahead I think we might
 
01:14:01.850 --> 01:14:01.860 align:start position:0%
see some amazing things and we might see
 
01:14:03.590 --> 01:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
even higher performance from all of our
 
01:14:05.750 --> 01:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
students when they see their peers
 
01:14:07.669 --> 01:14:07.679 align:start position:0%
really do get an opportunity and they're
 
01:14:09.649 --> 01:14:09.659 align:start position:0%
not just told to sit down look at the
 
01:14:11.030 --> 01:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
wall and pretend like you're not done
 
01:14:13.010 --> 01:14:13.020 align:start position:0%
with your project you know maybe that's
 
01:14:15.410 --> 01:14:15.420 align:start position:0%
just coming from my personal opinion I I
 
01:14:17.570 --> 01:14:17.580 align:start position:0%
was reading 1984 in my second grade
 
01:14:19.370 --> 01:14:19.380 align:start position:0%
classroom and my teacher thought that I
 
01:14:20.930 --> 01:14:20.940 align:start position:0%
I wasn't wasn't
 
01:14:20.940 --> 01:14:21.649 align:start position:0%
I wasn't wasn't
um

01:14:21.649 --> 01:14:21.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:24.470 --> 01:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
I wasn't gifted enough to be tested and
 
01:14:26.090 --> 01:14:26.100 align:start position:0%
and I think that all children should
 
01:14:28.370 --> 01:14:28.380 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to prove or improve
 
01:14:31.070 --> 01:14:31.080 align:start position:0%
their Merit and if they fall short that
 
01:14:33.410 --> 01:14:33.420 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that there there it doesn't
 
01:14:35.570 --> 01:14:35.580 align:start position:0%
mean that they they aren't smart it just
 
01:14:36.890 --> 01:14:36.900 align:start position:0%
means that they've realized that there
 
01:14:39.470 --> 01:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
is a challenge in front of them and they
 
01:14:41.630 --> 01:14:41.640 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to confront that
 
01:14:47.330 --> 01:14:47.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:49.430 --> 01:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:14:53.149 --> 01:14:53.159 align:start position:0%
um my I'm gonna I'm gonna Veer away from
 
01:14:55.310 --> 01:14:55.320 align:start position:0%
the philosophical and back towards the
 
01:14:57.709 --> 01:14:57.719 align:start position:0%
pragmatic a little so I guess this is a
 
01:15:00.410 --> 01:15:00.420 align:start position:0%
question for representative moffatt
 
01:15:00.420 --> 01:15:01.149 align:start position:0%
question for representative moffatt
um

01:15:01.149 --> 01:15:01.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:03.950 --> 01:15:03.960 align:start position:0%
my question is have you spoken to
 
01:15:06.550 --> 01:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
anybody at the Department of Education
 
01:15:09.890 --> 01:15:09.900 align:start position:0%
with regards to representative Ellison's
 
01:15:11.750 --> 01:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
previous comments that there used to be
 
01:15:14.450 --> 01:15:14.460 align:start position:0%
a gifted and talented person or a person
 
01:15:16.250 --> 01:15:16.260 align:start position:0%
well uh
 
01:15:18.470 --> 01:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
truly there will be gifted and talented
 
01:15:20.149 --> 01:15:20.159 align:start position:0%
people at the Department of Education
 
01:15:25.270 --> 01:15:25.280 align:start position:0%
but a person dedicated to managing uh
 
01:15:28.910 --> 01:15:28.920 align:start position:0%
gifted and talented programming uh have
 
01:15:32.149 --> 01:15:32.159 align:start position:0%
you spoken to anybody to find out sort
 
01:15:35.350 --> 01:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
of what has happened in the past and
 
01:15:39.649 --> 01:15:39.659 align:start position:0%
where these reports might be most useful
 
01:15:44.870 --> 01:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
uh and if so is there a person in place
 
01:15:48.350 --> 01:15:48.360 align:start position:0%
now who would actually be receiving
 
01:15:51.410 --> 01:15:51.420 align:start position:0%
these reports and answering the
 
01:15:54.110 --> 01:15:54.120 align:start position:0%
inquiries of school districts who would
 
01:15:56.689 --> 01:15:56.699 align:start position:0%
be in touch with the doe
 
01:15:58.910 --> 01:15:58.920 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you representative Mullen for
 
01:16:01.550 --> 01:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
your question uh sure uh I did have
 
01:16:04.430 --> 01:16:04.440 align:start position:0%
conversations uh uh two terms ago when
 
01:16:05.990 --> 01:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
we put this together initially with a
 
01:16:08.450 --> 01:16:08.460 align:start position:0%
number of Folks At Doe
 
01:16:10.370 --> 01:16:10.380 align:start position:0%
um my understanding is historically in
 
01:16:12.830 --> 01:16:12.840 align:start position:0%
the past there there was uh an
 
01:16:15.050 --> 01:16:15.060 align:start position:0%
individual or a position there that at
 
01:16:18.649 --> 01:16:18.659 align:start position:0%
least in part-time status uh focused on
 
01:16:21.770 --> 01:16:21.780 align:start position:0%
this area and that no longer exists as I
 
01:16:24.290 --> 01:16:24.300 align:start position:0%
understand it uh so should this move
 
01:16:27.770 --> 01:16:27.780 align:start position:0%
forward and should these reports uh come
 
01:16:30.950 --> 01:16:30.960 align:start position:0%
to doe they'll be at the doe to uh do
 
01:16:33.169 --> 01:16:33.179 align:start position:0%
what they wanted with the information
 
01:16:36.229 --> 01:16:36.239 align:start position:0%
um I think that to your point
 
01:16:40.130 --> 01:16:40.140 align:start position:0%
um once if assuming this moves forward
 
01:16:43.010 --> 01:16:43.020 align:start position:0%
once all this information comes to doe I
 
01:16:45.169 --> 01:16:45.179 align:start position:0%
think this could be an impetus for doe
 
01:16:48.590 --> 01:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
to uh revive this position
 
01:16:50.330 --> 01:16:50.340 align:start position:0%
um and I think that would be a good
 
01:16:52.430 --> 01:16:52.440 align:start position:0%
thing but again that's again up to doe
 
01:16:54.709 --> 01:16:54.719 align:start position:0%
and again there is no mandate here
 
01:16:56.630 --> 01:16:56.640 align:start position:0%
there's no spending
 
01:16:59.450 --> 01:16:59.460 align:start position:0%
um it's very simple and I think that uh
 
01:17:01.250 --> 01:17:01.260 align:start position:0%
only good things could come from this
 
01:17:05.390 --> 01:17:05.400 align:start position:0%
add doe to your point and also locally I
 
01:17:09.610 --> 01:17:09.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:11.689 --> 01:17:11.699 align:start position:0%
somewhat but thank you for at least
 
01:17:13.370 --> 01:17:13.380 align:start position:0%
attempting an answer representative
 
01:17:13.380 --> 01:17:14.870 align:start position:0%
attempting an answer representative
Moffett

01:17:14.870 --> 01:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
Moffett
 
01:17:17.510 --> 01:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:17:19.250 --> 01:17:19.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair if you made a lot I'd
 
01:17:21.290 --> 01:17:21.300 align:start position:0%
like to ask if I could represent Allison
 
01:17:25.790 --> 01:17:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:27.290 --> 01:17:27.300 align:start position:0%
yeah certainly
 
01:17:29.930 --> 01:17:29.940 align:start position:0%
thank you uh president Olson you spoke
 
01:17:29.940 --> 01:17:30.890 align:start position:0%
thank you uh president Olson you spoke
about

01:17:30.890 --> 01:17:30.900 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:17:33.290 --> 01:17:33.300 align:start position:0%
um the doe uh receiving all this
 
01:17:34.790 --> 01:17:34.800 align:start position:0%
information and I understand the process
 
01:17:36.290 --> 01:17:36.300 align:start position:0%
that representative Mafia was talking
 
01:17:38.750 --> 01:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
about my question is
 
01:17:41.630 --> 01:17:41.640 align:start position:0%
um I when there is a file or a program
 
01:17:44.709 --> 01:17:44.719 align:start position:0%
like this coming into doe do they record
 
01:17:49.250 --> 01:17:49.260 align:start position:0%
how many times is are viewed or other
 
01:17:51.229 --> 01:17:51.239 align:start position:0%
people look at it so you have an actual
 
01:17:53.209 --> 01:17:53.219 align:start position:0%
idea of of high school you're actually
 
01:17:55.790 --> 01:17:55.800 align:start position:0%
using this these types of documents
 
01:17:58.130 --> 01:17:58.140 align:start position:0%
uh if there's a person there who's in
 
01:18:00.490 --> 01:18:00.500 align:start position:0%
charge of the program or the concept
 
01:18:03.830 --> 01:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
that then yes someone is monitoring that
 
01:18:06.590 --> 01:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
and trying to sort of facilitate
 
01:18:09.229 --> 01:18:09.239 align:start position:0%
communication between the people asking
 
01:18:11.090 --> 01:18:11.100 align:start position:0%
questions and the people filing reports
 
01:18:14.630 --> 01:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
in the absence of that person uh it's my
 
01:18:16.910 --> 01:18:16.920 align:start position:0%
uh opinion that the reports go into a
 
01:18:19.070 --> 01:18:19.080 align:start position:0%
file and they stay there and there's no
 
01:18:19.080 --> 01:18:20.209 align:start position:0%
file and they stay there and there's no
interaction

01:18:20.209 --> 01:18:20.219 align:start position:0%
interaction
 
01:18:22.270 --> 01:18:22.280 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative uh
 
01:18:24.830 --> 01:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
Cordell I appreciate the opportunity
 
01:18:27.130 --> 01:18:27.140 align:start position:0%
sure uh representative
 
01:18:31.490 --> 01:18:31.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman Mr further
 
01:18:34.310 --> 01:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
um every school every school every
 
01:18:36.169 --> 01:18:36.179 align:start position:0%
person in the school model pretty much
 
01:18:39.350 --> 01:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
was gifted at one for example my
 
01:18:41.990 --> 01:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
granddaughter graduated in 2010 as well
 
01:18:44.209 --> 01:18:44.219 align:start position:0%
Victorian and if you asked her if she
 
01:18:46.850 --> 01:18:46.860 align:start position:0%
was gifted she would say no but she
 
01:18:49.970 --> 01:18:49.980 align:start position:0%
relied on other gifted students to get
 
01:18:53.149 --> 01:18:53.159 align:start position:0%
there she relied on a math gifted
 
01:18:55.970 --> 01:18:55.980 align:start position:0%
student one of a set of twins one was
 
01:18:59.350 --> 01:18:59.360 align:start position:0%
gifted in math in one of 2011 but
 
01:19:02.270 --> 01:19:02.280 align:start position:0%
identity but anyway she relied on him
 
01:19:05.470 --> 01:19:05.480 align:start position:0%
for her math
 
01:19:08.870 --> 01:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
she relied on other people I mean and
 
01:19:11.810 --> 01:19:11.820 align:start position:0%
people relied on her people know who is
 
01:19:14.510 --> 01:19:14.520 align:start position:0%
gifted and the whole school knows who
 
01:19:18.410 --> 01:19:18.420 align:start position:0%
was gifted so it's not not a secret it's
 
01:19:20.810 --> 01:19:20.820 align:start position:0%
not how many people know and nothing in
 
01:19:23.570 --> 01:19:23.580 align:start position:0%
the bill says identified they had to
 
01:19:26.689 --> 01:19:26.699 align:start position:0%
give a name you can say we send students
 
01:19:29.510 --> 01:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
from there to here and students Mentor
 
01:19:32.209 --> 01:19:32.219 align:start position:0%
other students and that's what was being
 
01:19:33.890 --> 01:19:33.900 align:start position:0%
done so
 
01:19:36.770 --> 01:19:36.780 align:start position:0%
uh by nominating the whole team and
 
01:19:39.950 --> 01:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
whatnot yeah the whole team's gifted in
 
01:19:41.810 --> 01:19:41.820 align:start position:0%
other words if everybody gets 100 points
 
01:19:44.390 --> 01:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
a game yeah but the point is
 
01:19:48.050 --> 01:19:48.060 align:start position:0%
it gifted students also rely on other
 
01:19:51.709 --> 01:19:51.719 align:start position:0%
gifted students I mean it they all work
 
01:19:54.050 --> 01:19:54.060 align:start position:0%
together they know who all is gifted
 
01:19:56.450 --> 01:19:56.460 align:start position:0%
everybody in the in our high school
 
01:19:59.689 --> 01:19:59.699 align:start position:0%
knows who's gifted and and nobody argues
 
01:20:02.090 --> 01:20:02.100 align:start position:0%
the point I've never seen any parents
 
01:20:04.729 --> 01:20:04.739 align:start position:0%
take my kid just to gift it now I mean
 
01:20:07.490 --> 01:20:07.500 align:start position:0%
kids know who's gifted and they go go
 
01:20:09.649 --> 01:20:09.659 align:start position:0%
that way and nothing in here said you
 
01:20:11.510 --> 01:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
have to be named you just identify
 
01:20:16.310 --> 01:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
identify as student a so
 
01:20:20.330 --> 01:20:20.340 align:start position:0%
the whole thing is schools know
 
01:20:24.350 --> 01:20:24.360 align:start position:0%
teachers know parents know who's gifted
 
01:20:28.910 --> 01:20:28.920 align:start position:0%
so you know so let's try and help the
 
01:20:31.250 --> 01:20:31.260 align:start position:0%
gifted students get be more gifted I
 
01:20:34.130 --> 01:20:34.140 align:start position:0%
have a thing by allowing him to go take
 
01:20:36.050 --> 01:20:36.060 align:start position:0%
some college courses and math if they
 
01:20:40.490 --> 01:20:40.500 align:start position:0%
want to I know uh UNH and Manchester for
 
01:20:43.790 --> 01:20:43.800 align:start position:0%
years really offering evening courses at
 
01:20:46.729 --> 01:20:46.739 align:start position:0%
UNH to Manchester for high school kids
 
01:20:49.610 --> 01:20:49.620 align:start position:0%
to get further credits and math so
 
01:20:52.370 --> 01:20:52.380 align:start position:0%
that's one of the ways you can you can
 
01:20:54.590 --> 01:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
do it like my granddaughter she had five
 
01:20:57.890 --> 01:20:57.900 align:start position:0%
years of math and she's not a math
 
01:21:00.290 --> 01:21:00.300 align:start position:0%
genius but yeah she took half with what
 
01:21:02.870 --> 01:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
she relied on and gifted students for
 
01:21:07.090 --> 01:21:07.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:10.130 --> 01:21:10.140 align:start position:0%
thanks very much Mr chair and I I just
 
01:21:11.870 --> 01:21:11.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to sort of follow up on what
 
01:21:14.510 --> 01:21:14.520 align:start position:0%
representative Bohm was just um
 
01:21:17.510 --> 01:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
um talking about and and you know I I I
 
01:21:20.149 --> 01:21:20.159 align:start position:0%
do agree with a lot of what's been been
 
01:21:22.790 --> 01:21:22.800 align:start position:0%
said this morning I guess I'm I'm
 
01:21:25.430 --> 01:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
struggling a bit with the uh with you
 
01:21:27.590 --> 01:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
know the terminology of you know gifted
 
01:21:30.050 --> 01:21:30.060 align:start position:0%
and talented versus I I mean which is
 
01:21:32.090 --> 01:21:32.100 align:start position:0%
what represent bone was talking about
 
01:21:34.189 --> 01:21:34.199 align:start position:0%
but he's he's saying everybody knows
 
01:21:36.110 --> 01:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
who's who's gifted
 
01:21:38.750 --> 01:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
um but but I I think at the same time
 
01:21:41.630 --> 01:21:41.640 align:start position:0%
you could sort of substitute that well
 
01:21:43.729 --> 01:21:43.739 align:start position:0%
everybody knows who's good at math I
 
01:21:46.310 --> 01:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
mean I was the go-to guy in math and
 
01:21:48.649 --> 01:21:48.659 align:start position:0%
chemistry in in high school and people
 
01:21:50.270 --> 01:21:50.280 align:start position:0%
knew I was good at that stuff because I
 
01:21:52.250 --> 01:21:52.260 align:start position:0%
like that stuff and I put a lot of time
 
01:21:57.169 --> 01:21:57.179 align:start position:0%
into that stuff and and um uh and and so
 
01:21:59.450 --> 01:21:59.460 align:start position:0%
I you know I I don't think
 
01:22:01.550 --> 01:22:01.560 align:start position:0%
I don't think I was born you know
 
01:22:03.890 --> 01:22:03.900 align:start position:0%
knowing how to do you know elliptical
 
01:22:05.810 --> 01:22:05.820 align:start position:0%
integrals or anything like that I mean I
 
01:22:07.189 --> 01:22:07.199 align:start position:0%
think I learned how to do that by
 
01:22:09.050 --> 01:22:09.060 align:start position:0%
putting in the effort
 
01:22:11.510 --> 01:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
um but and but so I guess my my question
 
01:22:13.970 --> 01:22:13.980 align:start position:0%
to represent boam if he'll take the
 
01:22:17.090 --> 01:22:17.100 align:start position:0%
question is what's where are you where
 
01:22:19.250 --> 01:22:19.260 align:start position:0%
are you drawing the line in terms of
 
01:22:23.830 --> 01:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
gifted versus being good at it
 
01:22:27.410 --> 01:22:27.420 align:start position:0%
if you want to uh that's fine
 
01:22:30.229 --> 01:22:30.239 align:start position:0%
that's that's a sort of a gray area yeah
 
01:22:32.030 --> 01:22:32.040 align:start position:0%
I mean like I mentioned my granddaughter
 
01:22:34.250 --> 01:22:34.260 align:start position:0%
she was good at hard work
 
01:22:36.830 --> 01:22:36.840 align:start position:0%
and she was good at fact knowing who was
 
01:22:39.770 --> 01:22:39.780 align:start position:0%
there are I mean at the gray areas
 
01:22:42.709 --> 01:22:42.719 align:start position:0%
somebody really worked hard gifted and
 
01:22:45.530 --> 01:22:45.540 align:start position:0%
working hard and they maybe then be able
 
01:22:49.130 --> 01:22:49.140 align:start position:0%
to Mentor other kids uh some kids are
 
01:22:52.729 --> 01:22:52.739 align:start position:0%
good at math I mean they just zoom no
 
01:22:54.830 --> 01:22:54.840 align:start position:0%
matter what you give them they they'll
 
01:22:57.050 --> 01:22:57.060 align:start position:0%
know it right from
 
01:22:59.810 --> 01:22:59.820 align:start position:0%
when they first started doing arithmetic
 
01:23:03.410 --> 01:23:03.420 align:start position:0%
I mean some kids are good at at uh
 
01:23:06.050 --> 01:23:06.060 align:start position:0%
English they can write all kinds of
 
01:23:09.709 --> 01:23:09.719 align:start position:0%
reports and whatnot uh but yeah the gray
 
01:23:12.229 --> 01:23:12.239 align:start position:0%
area there isn't any yeah working hard
 
01:23:15.350 --> 01:23:15.360 align:start position:0%
at something may make you gifted I mean
 
01:23:17.390 --> 01:23:17.400 align:start position:0%
so you know it's a hard question to
 
01:23:20.510 --> 01:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
answer but people know people know who
 
01:23:23.570 --> 01:23:23.580 align:start position:0%
to go to just like you said who to go to
 
01:23:27.050 --> 01:23:27.060 align:start position:0%
hey how do you I do this because anybody
 
01:23:28.189 --> 01:23:28.199 align:start position:0%
pretty much in the high school
 
01:23:29.870 --> 01:23:29.880 align:start position:0%
especially just keeping the smaller one
 
01:23:32.810 --> 01:23:32.820 align:start position:0%
even bigger one uh know who in that
 
01:23:35.450 --> 01:23:35.460 align:start position:0%
class they can ask questions of and not
 
01:23:38.270 --> 01:23:38.280 align:start position:0%
maybe but yeah they're gifted at working
 
01:23:41.689 --> 01:23:41.699 align:start position:0%
hard I mean I don't see any problem
 
01:23:45.590 --> 01:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
yeah so just a quick quick follow-up Mr
 
01:23:48.770 --> 01:23:48.780 align:start position:0%
chair so um so Ralph I I absolutely
 
01:23:50.930 --> 01:23:50.940 align:start position:0%
agree with a lot of what you just um
 
01:23:54.890 --> 01:23:54.900 align:start position:0%
said there and um and uh and and I I
 
01:23:57.410 --> 01:23:57.420 align:start position:0%
think there's good intentions behind
 
01:24:00.410 --> 01:24:00.420 align:start position:0%
you know all of this here
 
01:24:02.270 --> 01:24:02.280 align:start position:0%
um uh I am concerned about about
 
01:24:05.630 --> 01:24:05.640 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences when when using
 
01:24:07.970 --> 01:24:07.980 align:start position:0%
you know specific terms like gifted and
 
01:24:11.149 --> 01:24:11.159 align:start position:0%
talented and and um and what what that's
 
01:24:14.810 --> 01:24:14.820 align:start position:0%
encouraging or not encouraging and and I
 
01:24:16.370 --> 01:24:16.380 align:start position:0%
guess um you know once I know we're
 
01:24:18.110 --> 01:24:18.120 align:start position:0%
we're you know we're debating an
 
01:24:22.250 --> 01:24:22.260 align:start position:0%
amendment right now I think um 7 16. I'm
 
01:24:26.510 --> 01:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
sorry uh five uh 537 I think
 
01:24:30.229 --> 01:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
um and uh and uh and you know I'm hoping
 
01:24:32.149 --> 01:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
to be able to offer another amendment
 
01:24:34.910 --> 01:24:34.920 align:start position:0%
that I think in the spirit of the uh of
 
01:24:37.669 --> 01:24:37.679 align:start position:0%
the bill is as proposed
 
01:24:40.970 --> 01:24:40.980 align:start position:0%
um really sort of you know broadens the
 
01:24:43.550 --> 01:24:43.560 align:start position:0%
um the the approach here to talk about
 
01:24:45.709 --> 01:24:45.719 align:start position:0%
what representative bone was saying
 
01:24:47.870 --> 01:24:47.880 align:start position:0%
which is which is encouraging people to
 
01:24:50.689 --> 01:24:50.699 align:start position:0%
work hard and put in the effort and and
 
01:24:53.030 --> 01:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
that's really ultimately what leads to
 
01:24:55.430 --> 01:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
uh you know success in school and
 
01:24:58.130 --> 01:24:58.140 align:start position:0%
success in life and um you know I'm not
 
01:25:00.950 --> 01:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
trying to you know I I I think I think
 
01:25:02.810 --> 01:25:02.820 align:start position:0%
we're we're all looking at the best
 
01:25:05.750 --> 01:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
intentions surrounding this um
 
01:25:09.110 --> 01:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
um um this this legislation but um I'm
 
01:25:11.450 --> 01:25:11.460 align:start position:0%
hoping to have the opportunity to uh to
 
01:25:13.790 --> 01:25:13.800 align:start position:0%
offer that Amendment um uh after we get
 
01:25:15.110 --> 01:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
past this
 
01:25:15.120 --> 01:25:18.709 align:start position:0%
past this
Cornell

01:25:18.709 --> 01:25:18.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:21.649 --> 01:25:21.659 align:start position:0%
yeah this conversation has just
 
01:25:24.590 --> 01:25:24.600 align:start position:0%
um reinforced my idea that this is way
 
01:25:26.689 --> 01:25:26.699 align:start position:0%
too vague from listening to everybody
 
01:25:30.189 --> 01:25:30.199 align:start position:0%
talking I have no idea now what
 
01:25:32.090 --> 01:25:32.100 align:start position:0%
superintendents or school districts
 
01:25:35.030 --> 01:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
would be expected to send in is what
 
01:25:37.010 --> 01:25:37.020 align:start position:0%
they're offering for gifted
 
01:25:39.830 --> 01:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
students at according to representative
 
01:25:42.590 --> 01:25:42.600 align:start position:0%
boehm it could be we offer that the
 
01:25:45.709 --> 01:25:45.719 align:start position:0%
really smart kids help the ones that
 
01:25:47.630 --> 01:25:47.640 align:start position:0%
want to work really hard to become
 
01:25:51.169 --> 01:25:51.179 align:start position:0%
gifted or are we actually putting in
 
01:25:53.510 --> 01:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
that a School District offers
 
01:25:56.629 --> 01:25:56.639 align:start position:0%
you know advanced placement courses or
 
01:25:58.669 --> 01:25:58.679 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to participate in
 
01:26:01.490 --> 01:26:01.500 align:start position:0%
running star or a theater program or an
 
01:26:04.610 --> 01:26:04.620 align:start position:0%
advanced chorus program
 
01:26:08.510 --> 01:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
it it's just so vague to me what is
 
01:26:10.729 --> 01:26:10.739 align:start position:0%
going to be expected that I don't know
 
01:26:12.890 --> 01:26:12.900 align:start position:0%
that what's going to be sent in and put
 
01:26:15.590 --> 01:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
in the folder will be of any use of
 
01:26:18.709 --> 01:26:18.719 align:start position:0%
anybody that's going to look up to get
 
01:26:21.169 --> 01:26:21.179 align:start position:0%
ideas it's I I think it needs more
 
01:26:25.669 --> 01:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
definition and and I structure of
 
01:26:28.129 --> 01:26:28.139 align:start position:0%
what we're looking for if it's of any
 
01:26:29.570 --> 01:26:29.580 align:start position:0%
use at all
 
01:26:31.010 --> 01:26:31.020 align:start position:0%
that's all
 
01:26:34.669 --> 01:26:34.679 align:start position:0%
right thank you president Tanner
 
01:26:37.370 --> 01:26:37.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh before I spoke
 
01:26:40.729 --> 01:26:40.739 align:start position:0%
about money and time and also the fact
 
01:26:43.270 --> 01:26:43.280 align:start position:0%
that you know this program is really
 
01:26:46.250 --> 01:26:46.260 align:start position:0%
like uh representative Leon said is
 
01:26:49.850 --> 01:26:49.860 align:start position:0%
really for should be for the elementary
 
01:26:53.510 --> 01:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
and middle school students who at some
 
01:26:57.350 --> 01:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
point just just give up they they you
 
01:27:00.950 --> 01:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
know they want they want to be enriched
 
01:27:02.570 --> 01:27:02.580 align:start position:0%
they want to have the ability to be
 
01:27:04.850 --> 01:27:04.860 align:start position:0%
enriched what we're talking about most
 
01:27:06.770 --> 01:27:06.780 align:start position:0%
of the time here is like the robotics
 
01:27:08.810 --> 01:27:08.820 align:start position:0%
program the dual enrollment program
 
01:27:12.110 --> 01:27:12.120 align:start position:0%
that's all for the high school kids and
 
01:27:14.689 --> 01:27:14.699 align:start position:0%
and that takes a you know work and and
 
01:27:16.910 --> 01:27:16.920 align:start position:0%
initiative to get into those programs
 
01:27:19.310 --> 01:27:19.320 align:start position:0%
and if you have it you know you're
 
01:27:21.530 --> 01:27:21.540 align:start position:0%
you're going to seek out those programs
 
01:27:23.629 --> 01:27:23.639 align:start position:0%
and if you're in a school district that
 
01:27:25.070 --> 01:27:25.080 align:start position:0%
has a lot of money
 
01:27:26.629 --> 01:27:26.639 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a lot of
 
01:27:28.490 --> 01:27:28.500 align:start position:0%
opportunities for you if you're in a
 
01:27:30.470 --> 01:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
school district with not a lot of money
 
01:27:33.169 --> 01:27:33.179 align:start position:0%
there there's not a lot of opportunity
 
01:27:34.550 --> 01:27:34.560 align:start position:0%
for you but down at the elementary
 
01:27:36.770 --> 01:27:36.780 align:start position:0%
school if you're a teacher and you have
 
01:27:40.610 --> 01:27:40.620 align:start position:0%
25 30 kids in class and you've got one
 
01:27:42.229 --> 01:27:42.239 align:start position:0%
kid that's running around and
 
01:27:45.290 --> 01:27:45.300 align:start position:0%
hyperactive and seems to finish the
 
01:27:47.750 --> 01:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
workbook stuff really fast
 
01:27:50.090 --> 01:27:50.100 align:start position:0%
those are the kids we want to grab and
 
01:27:53.450 --> 01:27:53.460 align:start position:0%
give enrichment programs to and I'm not
 
01:27:53.460 --> 01:27:54.290 align:start position:0%
give enrichment programs to and I'm not
sure

01:27:54.290 --> 01:27:54.300 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:27:57.110 --> 01:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
we even have any identification for that
 
01:28:00.050 --> 01:28:00.060 align:start position:0%
at this point and I would suggest that
 
01:28:04.129 --> 01:28:04.139 align:start position:0%
if as we search into this uh
 
01:28:07.729 --> 01:28:07.739 align:start position:0%
issue more that we stopped talking about
 
01:28:10.790 --> 01:28:10.800 align:start position:0%
high school where there is all kinds of
 
01:28:13.310 --> 01:28:13.320 align:start position:0%
opportunities and really look at
 
01:28:15.890 --> 01:28:15.900 align:start position:0%
elementary and middle schools
 
01:28:20.149 --> 01:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
um where this program would be uh key to
 
01:28:22.970 --> 01:28:22.980 align:start position:0%
to growth for a lot of students I think
 
01:28:25.669 --> 01:28:25.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:27.890 --> 01:28:27.900 align:start position:0%
representative Leon
 
01:28:31.070 --> 01:28:31.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair this is one of the
 
01:28:32.750 --> 01:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
areas where we do have great
 
01:28:34.610 --> 01:28:34.620 align:start position:0%
opportunities and such schools in the
 
01:28:36.169 --> 01:28:36.179 align:start position:0%
state and high school level and you're
 
01:28:37.669 --> 01:28:37.679 align:start position:0%
right that in some communities they
 
01:28:39.530 --> 01:28:39.540 align:start position:0%
don't have those same opportunities
 
01:28:43.250 --> 01:28:43.260 align:start position:0%
but when if the children are excited
 
01:28:45.890 --> 01:28:45.900 align:start position:0%
about what they can do it they can
 
01:28:48.110 --> 01:28:48.120 align:start position:0%
probably work with teachers that are
 
01:28:49.430 --> 01:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
interested in order to be able to build
 
01:28:51.410 --> 01:28:51.420 align:start position:0%
these programs at their schools if
 
01:28:53.149 --> 01:28:53.159 align:start position:0%
they're not aware of what's happening
 
01:28:55.490 --> 01:28:55.500 align:start position:0%
and how it's being done in these more
 
01:28:57.169 --> 01:28:57.179 align:start position:0%
exceptional school districts it's a lot
 
01:28:59.030 --> 01:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
harder for them to create a on a limited
 
01:29:02.209 --> 01:29:02.219 align:start position:0%
budget in uh in rural school districts
 
01:29:04.550 --> 01:29:04.560 align:start position:0%
if they're able to work together see
 
01:29:06.110 --> 01:29:06.120 align:start position:0%
what those opportunities are and start
 
01:29:08.149 --> 01:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
developing their skills this is going to
 
01:29:09.770 --> 01:29:09.780 align:start position:0%
push everybody forward I mean you look
 
01:29:11.629 --> 01:29:11.639 align:start position:0%
at Honey Escalante and what he did in LA
 
01:29:13.070 --> 01:29:13.080 align:start position:0%
in the public schools with those
 
01:29:15.530 --> 01:29:15.540 align:start position:0%
students people didn't expect those
 
01:29:16.910 --> 01:29:16.920 align:start position:0%
children those students to be able to
 
01:29:19.370 --> 01:29:19.380 align:start position:0%
perform that way but but the opportunity
 
01:29:22.490 --> 01:29:22.500 align:start position:0%
was there and they seized on it if you
 
01:29:24.709 --> 01:29:24.719 align:start position:0%
expose them to the opportunity the
 
01:29:26.930 --> 01:29:26.940 align:start position:0%
potential of what can happen and what
 
01:29:31.129 --> 01:29:31.139 align:start position:0%
they can do it's it's amazing what you
 
01:29:34.010 --> 01:29:34.020 align:start position:0%
can see and a lot of these kids in these
 
01:29:35.990 --> 01:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
in these four school districts don't
 
01:29:37.850 --> 01:29:37.860 align:start position:0%
really know exactly what can happen even
 
01:29:40.729 --> 01:29:40.739 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire and it's I don't
 
01:29:42.470 --> 01:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
think that it's a matter
 
01:29:44.090 --> 01:29:44.100 align:start position:0%
where they would love to say that
 
01:29:45.110 --> 01:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
they're being left out of the
 
01:29:47.930 --> 01:29:47.940 align:start position:0%
opportunity I think that if you can see
 
01:29:50.629 --> 01:29:50.639 align:start position:0%
this see what can happen and make it
 
01:29:52.070 --> 01:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
happen in your community that's going to
 
01:29:53.390 --> 01:29:53.400 align:start position:0%
make them a lot stronger that's going to
 
01:29:55.610 --> 01:29:55.620 align:start position:0%
make them Future Leaders that's the sort
 
01:29:57.290 --> 01:29:57.300 align:start position:0%
of thing that can motivate these gifted
 
01:29:58.970 --> 01:29:58.980 align:start position:0%
students in order to bring about these
 
01:30:01.490 --> 01:30:01.500 align:start position:0%
opportunities and develop them and
 
01:30:03.950 --> 01:30:03.960 align:start position:0%
letting these students have a look at
 
01:30:05.270 --> 01:30:05.280 align:start position:0%
what's happening across the state
 
01:30:08.629 --> 01:30:08.639 align:start position:0%
perhaps in a in a in a club for gifted
 
01:30:10.129 --> 01:30:10.139 align:start position:0%
students with one of the teachers
 
01:30:11.930 --> 01:30:11.940 align:start position:0%
directing it they could they could
 
01:30:14.149 --> 01:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
create a framework and I think that if
 
01:30:16.010 --> 01:30:16.020 align:start position:0%
we crowdsource it even to these gifted
 
01:30:17.629 --> 01:30:17.639 align:start position:0%
students in the elementary and middle
 
01:30:20.450 --> 01:30:20.460 align:start position:0%
school ages this this could bring really
 
01:30:22.370 --> 01:30:22.380 align:start position:0%
amazing opportunities and I think that
 
01:30:23.689 --> 01:30:23.699 align:start position:0%
it would develop a lot of different
 
01:30:25.970 --> 01:30:25.980 align:start position:0%
skills for them while they work on these
 
01:30:28.250 --> 01:30:28.260 align:start position:0%
projects and just developing their own
 
01:30:30.890 --> 01:30:30.900 align:start position:0%
program for gifted would be a phenomenal
 
01:30:32.810 --> 01:30:32.820 align:start position:0%
research resource and a phenomenal
 
01:30:35.930 --> 01:30:35.940 align:start position:0%
learning opportunity thank you uh
 
01:30:35.940 --> 01:30:38.030 align:start position:0%
learning opportunity thank you uh
representative

01:30:38.030 --> 01:30:38.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:30:40.070 --> 01:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
yeah we'll keep talking about no
 
01:30:43.310 --> 01:30:43.320 align:start position:0%
definition but there is a definition a
 
01:30:45.229 --> 01:30:45.239 align:start position:0%
student identified as having unique
 
01:30:47.770 --> 01:30:47.780 align:start position:0%
academic artistic or athletic potential
 
01:30:50.270 --> 01:30:50.280 align:start position:0%
according to assessments selected and
 
01:30:52.030 --> 01:30:52.040 align:start position:0%
administered locally
 
01:30:52.040 --> 01:30:53.810 align:start position:0%
administered locally
and

01:30:53.810 --> 01:30:53.820 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:30:56.390 --> 01:30:56.400 align:start position:0%
um we always talk about local control
 
01:30:58.910 --> 01:30:58.920 align:start position:0%
and local whatever but the other part of
 
01:31:01.910 --> 01:31:01.920 align:start position:0%
that is as representative Leon said if
 
01:31:05.810 --> 01:31:05.820 align:start position:0%
you start making very narrow definitions
 
01:31:09.830 --> 01:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
of I mean it's something unique unique
 
01:31:13.070 --> 01:31:13.080 align:start position:0%
academic artistic girl at athletic
 
01:31:16.669 --> 01:31:16.679 align:start position:0%
potential that's all that is and if you
 
01:31:18.950 --> 01:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
start making oh you have to have a
 
01:31:21.350 --> 01:31:21.360 align:start position:0%
certain IQ or you have to have you're
 
01:31:26.330 --> 01:31:26.340 align:start position:0%
limiting people and so I think
 
01:31:29.649 --> 01:31:29.659 align:start position:0%
um making this any narrower
 
01:31:29.659 --> 01:31:31.250 align:start position:0%
um making this any narrower
is

01:31:31.250 --> 01:31:31.260 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:31:33.410 --> 01:31:33.420 align:start position:0%
um is counterproductive because you
 
01:31:36.350 --> 01:31:36.360 align:start position:0%
don't know where that's going to show up
 
01:31:39.050 --> 01:31:39.060 align:start position:0%
who that's going to be What that
 
01:31:42.649 --> 01:31:42.659 align:start position:0%
particular academic potential or
 
01:31:44.990 --> 01:31:45.000 align:start position:0%
athletic or artistic potential is going
 
01:31:47.930 --> 01:31:47.940 align:start position:0%
to be it may be somebody who's
 
01:31:51.229 --> 01:31:51.239 align:start position:0%
affordable at academics but is a
 
01:31:52.850 --> 01:31:52.860 align:start position:0%
fantastic artist
 
01:31:56.149 --> 01:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
or a musician or whatever and the point
 
01:31:59.570 --> 01:31:59.580 align:start position:0%
is for the school to come up with a plan
 
01:32:02.390 --> 01:32:02.400 align:start position:0%
for that child for each one of those
 
01:32:06.410 --> 01:32:06.420 align:start position:0%
children not for big ballpark fit in the
 
01:32:10.070 --> 01:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
Box you know rules and guidelines but
 
01:32:12.830 --> 01:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
this child what are we doing about this
 
01:32:15.530 --> 01:32:15.540 align:start position:0%
child and by having the school and it
 
01:32:17.629 --> 01:32:17.639 align:start position:0%
doesn't say elementary middle school
 
01:32:20.570 --> 01:32:20.580 align:start position:0%
high school it just says every school
 
01:32:22.610 --> 01:32:22.620 align:start position:0%
which will hit those elementary kids
 
01:32:24.890 --> 01:32:24.900 align:start position:0%
it'll hit the middle school kids and the
 
01:32:27.410 --> 01:32:27.420 align:start position:0%
high school kids and it just says do you
 
01:32:28.729 --> 01:32:28.739 align:start position:0%
have a plan
 
01:32:31.910 --> 01:32:31.920 align:start position:0%
and and and if you don't have a plan you
 
01:32:33.830 --> 01:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
gotta write and say I don't have a plan
 
01:32:36.229 --> 01:32:36.239 align:start position:0%
so maybe this will before they have to
 
01:32:38.510 --> 01:32:38.520 align:start position:0%
go and say I don't have a plan they
 
01:32:40.729 --> 01:32:40.739 align:start position:0%
might say hmm maybe I should come up
 
01:32:43.729 --> 01:32:43.739 align:start position:0%
with a plan maybe I should look and see
 
01:32:48.110 --> 01:32:48.120 align:start position:0%
what kids are have special talents in
 
01:32:50.209 --> 01:32:50.219 align:start position:0%
any particular area and what I can do
 
01:32:52.370 --> 01:32:52.380 align:start position:0%
for that child
 
01:32:56.209 --> 01:32:56.219 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
01:32:59.689 --> 01:32:59.699 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative cordelli
 
01:33:01.669 --> 01:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
um I would first like to say that I hope
 
01:33:03.110 --> 01:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
that the kind of inspirational
 
01:33:05.450 --> 01:33:05.460 align:start position:0%
instruction that representative lecus is
 
01:33:07.430 --> 01:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
referring to is going on in classrooms
 
01:33:10.490 --> 01:33:10.500 align:start position:0%
all over New Hampshire regardless of how
 
01:33:12.229 --> 01:33:12.239 align:start position:0%
many gifted students are in the
 
01:33:15.169 --> 01:33:15.179 align:start position:0%
classroom or not but I can tell you that
 
01:33:17.390 --> 01:33:17.400 align:start position:0%
the district I represent has a very
 
01:33:21.350 --> 01:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
robust program for uh gifted and
 
01:33:24.050 --> 01:33:24.060 align:start position:0%
talented students and that the key to
 
01:33:28.790 --> 01:33:28.800 align:start position:0%
success uh at least partially uh relies
 
01:33:32.090 --> 01:33:32.100 align:start position:0%
upon the staff in the building that have
 
01:33:35.810 --> 01:33:35.820 align:start position:0%
been hired and dedicated to gifted and
 
01:33:38.209 --> 01:33:38.219 align:start position:0%
talented instruction not the classroom
 
01:33:41.030 --> 01:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
teacher we have Personnel in every
 
01:33:44.570 --> 01:33:44.580 align:start position:0%
Elementary School that are dedicated to
 
01:33:47.270 --> 01:33:47.280 align:start position:0%
teaching gifted and talented Youth and
 
01:33:50.450 --> 01:33:50.460 align:start position:0%
offering enrichment opportunities uh to
 
01:33:53.510 --> 01:33:53.520 align:start position:0%
our students and until we're able to do
 
01:33:56.209 --> 01:33:56.219 align:start position:0%
that in every school in New Hampshire
 
01:33:59.450 --> 01:33:59.460 align:start position:0%
sure putting information into a folder
 
01:34:02.990 --> 01:34:03.000 align:start position:0%
at the doe May in fact offer some
 
01:34:04.790 --> 01:34:04.800 align:start position:0%
assistance but I don't think it's going
 
01:34:06.709 --> 01:34:06.719 align:start position:0%
to even come close to offering the kind
 
01:34:08.689 --> 01:34:08.699 align:start position:0%
of assistance that most districts need
 
01:34:10.250 --> 01:34:10.260 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:34:16.370 --> 01:34:16.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:18.530 --> 01:34:18.540 align:start position:0%
I forgot to take my hand down sorry
 
01:34:19.790 --> 01:34:19.800 align:start position:0%
about that
 
01:34:23.450 --> 01:34:23.460 align:start position:0%
thank you there I go
 
01:34:26.689 --> 01:34:26.699 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chair you know
 
01:34:30.890 --> 01:34:30.900 align:start position:0%
it's interesting that this uh topic has
 
01:34:32.090 --> 01:34:32.100 align:start position:0%
been one of the most substantive
 
01:34:33.530 --> 01:34:33.540 align:start position:0%
conversations this committee has
 
01:34:35.470 --> 01:34:35.480 align:start position:0%
entertained since we've been together
 
01:34:37.790 --> 01:34:37.800 align:start position:0%
and I don't think there's any question
 
01:34:40.070 --> 01:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
in any of our minds about the importance
 
01:34:43.250 --> 01:34:43.260 align:start position:0%
of this particular topic and yet
 
01:34:46.129 --> 01:34:46.139 align:start position:0%
at the Department of Education there is
 
01:34:47.450 --> 01:34:47.460 align:start position:0%
no one
 
01:34:49.790 --> 01:34:49.800 align:start position:0%
looking after this program
 
01:34:51.850 --> 01:34:51.860 align:start position:0%
and I think that's a shame
 
01:34:55.010 --> 01:34:55.020 align:start position:0%
so notwithstanding the issue that I said
 
01:34:55.020 --> 01:34:55.970 align:start position:0%
so notwithstanding the issue that I said
earlier

01:34:55.970 --> 01:34:55.980 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
01:34:59.090 --> 01:34:59.100 align:start position:0%
that this needs more than just a file
 
01:35:01.850 --> 01:35:01.860 align:start position:0%
for this information to go to and I
 
01:35:03.530 --> 01:35:03.540 align:start position:0%
would hope that those persons from the
 
01:35:04.970 --> 01:35:04.980 align:start position:0%
Department that are listening to this
 
01:35:07.490 --> 01:35:07.500 align:start position:0%
conversation will begin to take notice
 
01:35:10.189 --> 01:35:10.199 align:start position:0%
of how important this is and perhaps
 
01:35:12.169 --> 01:35:12.179 align:start position:0%
take a little more attention to this
 
01:35:16.550 --> 01:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
program thank you thank you
 
01:35:16.560 --> 01:35:19.570 align:start position:0%
program thank you thank you
um

01:35:19.570 --> 01:35:19.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:22.550 --> 01:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
finalize uh this discussion with your
 
01:35:25.430 --> 01:35:25.440 align:start position:0%
comments okay thank you Mr chair
 
01:35:26.930 --> 01:35:26.940 align:start position:0%
um representative Mullen that sounds
 
01:35:28.550 --> 01:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
like an amazing program that you have in
 
01:35:31.070 --> 01:35:31.080 align:start position:0%
the Bedford schools is I'm curious if
 
01:35:32.270 --> 01:35:32.280 align:start position:0%
that's something that's being shared
 
01:35:34.970 --> 01:35:34.980 align:start position:0%
because that would be a great resource
 
01:35:36.290 --> 01:35:36.300 align:start position:0%
for a lot of these other school
 
01:35:38.270 --> 01:35:38.280 align:start position:0%
districts I'm also really encouraged
 
01:35:40.669 --> 01:35:40.679 align:start position:0%
with this discussion uh right now it
 
01:35:42.530 --> 01:35:42.540 align:start position:0%
seems that there's a big Trend to do
 
01:35:44.990 --> 01:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
away with recognizing strong performance
 
01:35:46.490 --> 01:35:46.500 align:start position:0%
in students I know we've done away with
 
01:35:49.610 --> 01:35:49.620 align:start position:0%
letter grades and dairy and and it's
 
01:35:52.430 --> 01:35:52.440 align:start position:0%
very inspiring to know that we still are
 
01:35:54.110 --> 01:35:54.120 align:start position:0%
appreciating students and success and
 
01:35:56.390 --> 01:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
student achievement especially because
 
01:35:58.729 --> 01:35:58.739 align:start position:0%
if a student's sitting next next to
 
01:36:00.110 --> 01:36:00.120 align:start position:0%
another student in class and that
 
01:36:01.610 --> 01:36:01.620 align:start position:0%
student's gifted but nobody will
 
01:36:03.649 --> 01:36:03.659 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that fact they might be
 
01:36:05.209 --> 01:36:05.219 align:start position:0%
comparing themselves against their seat
 
01:36:07.729 --> 01:36:07.739 align:start position:0%
mate and not realize that it's like a
 
01:36:09.290 --> 01:36:09.300 align:start position:0%
kid who went to school with Shaquille
 
01:36:11.270 --> 01:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
O'Neal questioning how they play
 
01:36:11.280 --> 01:36:12.770 align:start position:0%
O'Neal questioning how they play
basketball

01:36:12.770 --> 01:36:12.780 align:start position:0%
basketball
 
01:36:14.510 --> 01:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
um it it does a service both for the
 
01:36:15.770 --> 01:36:15.780 align:start position:0%
kids that get recognized for their
 
01:36:17.030 --> 01:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
giftedness and the other ones that
 
01:36:19.010 --> 01:36:19.020 align:start position:0%
realize they actually are sitting next
 
01:36:20.750 --> 01:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
to a student he really understands the
 
01:36:22.070 --> 01:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
subject and has an interesting
 
01:36:24.050 --> 01:36:24.060 align:start position:0%
perspective on it because then they can
 
01:36:26.209 --> 01:36:26.219 align:start position:0%
ask questions instead of feeling like
 
01:36:28.010 --> 01:36:28.020 align:start position:0%
they might be less than just because
 
01:36:29.870 --> 01:36:29.880 align:start position:0%
just because the student next to them
 
01:36:32.570 --> 01:36:32.580 align:start position:0%
really understands calculus at an early
 
01:36:34.910 --> 01:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
age or they just love organic chemistry
 
01:36:37.610 --> 01:36:37.620 align:start position:0%
so this is something where it helps the
 
01:36:39.110 --> 01:36:39.120 align:start position:0%
kids that are gifted it helps the kids
 
01:36:41.570 --> 01:36:41.580 align:start position:0%
who are have the opportunity to work
 
01:36:45.110 --> 01:36:45.120 align:start position:0%
with them and I'm I'm excited that if we
 
01:36:46.189 --> 01:36:46.199 align:start position:0%
can get some more of this information
 
01:36:47.870 --> 01:36:47.880 align:start position:0%
perhaps that's something where we can
 
01:36:49.550 --> 01:36:49.560 align:start position:0%
get more of an effort at the department
 
01:36:51.590 --> 01:36:51.600 align:start position:0%
level but let's find out what we're
 
01:36:53.510 --> 01:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
doing let's get these best practices in
 
01:36:56.209 --> 01:36:56.219 align:start position:0%
and and let's move this forward so that
 
01:36:57.950 --> 01:36:57.960 align:start position:0%
we can do this and we can understand and
 
01:36:59.270 --> 01:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
then then maybe the Department of
 
01:37:00.830 --> 01:37:00.840 align:start position:0%
Education can do something for Gidget
 
01:37:02.930 --> 01:37:02.940 align:start position:0%
students I would love to see that
 
01:37:06.649 --> 01:37:06.659 align:start position:0%
thank you I think maybe uh we are ready
 
01:37:11.870 --> 01:37:11.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:11.880 --> 01:37:14.870 align:start position:0%

I'd I'd love to introduce it just um
 
01:40:10.430 --> 01:40:10.440 align:start position:0%
just briefly thank you very much Mr
 
01:40:13.669 --> 01:40:13.679 align:start position:0%
chair so so uh as I mentioned earlier I
 
01:40:15.709 --> 01:40:15.719 align:start position:0%
mean I largely agree with a lot of what
 
01:40:16.910 --> 01:40:16.920 align:start position:0%
what what
 
01:40:18.830 --> 01:40:18.840 align:start position:0%
um what members of the committee on on
 
01:40:20.990 --> 01:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
both sides have been um been talking
 
01:40:23.030 --> 01:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
about with respect to the uh the
 
01:40:26.270 --> 01:40:26.280 align:start position:0%
intention behind house bill 321.
 
01:40:28.430 --> 01:40:28.440 align:start position:0%
um and and that we're uh we're we're
 
01:40:31.310 --> 01:40:31.320 align:start position:0%
really trying to you know encourage you
 
01:40:33.050 --> 01:40:33.060 align:start position:0%
know students who are working hard and
 
01:40:36.649 --> 01:40:36.659 align:start position:0%
doing doing well and um and uh for them
 
01:40:40.129 --> 01:40:40.139 align:start position:0%
to uh to share that motivation and and
 
01:40:42.350 --> 01:40:42.360 align:start position:0%
that that passion for whatever it is
 
01:40:44.390 --> 01:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
whether it's math whether it's
 
01:40:47.570 --> 01:40:47.580 align:start position:0%
basketball whether it's chemistry uh
 
01:40:49.729 --> 01:40:49.739 align:start position:0%
with um with their with their fellow
 
01:40:49.739 --> 01:40:51.290 align:start position:0%
with um with their with their fellow
classmates

01:40:51.290 --> 01:40:51.300 align:start position:0%
classmates
 
01:40:54.709 --> 01:40:54.719 align:start position:0%
um and um and you know what what what I
 
01:40:57.169 --> 01:40:57.179 align:start position:0%
think um well what I what I know the uh
 
01:41:01.189 --> 01:41:01.199 align:start position:0%
the amendment 752 does is um is is
 
01:41:05.570 --> 01:41:05.580 align:start position:0%
really it just um it just moves uses
 
01:41:07.310 --> 01:41:07.320 align:start position:0%
different terms where it replaces the
 
01:41:10.370 --> 01:41:10.380 align:start position:0%
terms gifted and talid talented with uh
 
01:41:12.470 --> 01:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
with terms that encourage student growth
 
01:41:14.810 --> 01:41:14.820 align:start position:0%
and effort and um
 
01:41:17.810 --> 01:41:17.820 align:start position:0%
um and so it uh you know basically adds
 
01:41:20.390 --> 01:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
in Roman one findings that studies show
 
01:41:22.070 --> 01:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
teaching people to have a growth mindset
 
01:41:24.470 --> 01:41:24.480 align:start position:0%
which encourages a focus on effort helps
 
01:41:26.270 --> 01:41:26.280 align:start position:0%
them to become High Achievers in school
 
01:41:28.370 --> 01:41:28.380 align:start position:0%
and in life and that's actually
 
01:41:31.010 --> 01:41:31.020 align:start position:0%
something that um that I think I I
 
01:41:34.790 --> 01:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
quoted from back when uh back when we
 
01:41:38.629 --> 01:41:38.639 align:start position:0%
held the hearing on on 321 uh last month
 
01:41:43.030 --> 01:41:43.040 align:start position:0%
and um and then uh Roman 2
 
01:41:46.669 --> 01:41:46.679 align:start position:0%
largely follows what uh what the what
 
01:41:48.350 --> 01:41:48.360 align:start position:0%
the the previous Amendment and the
 
01:41:52.070 --> 01:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
underlying bildo which is um uh require
 
01:41:54.050 --> 01:41:54.060 align:start position:0%
um uh all New Hampshire Public Schools
 
01:41:55.850 --> 01:41:55.860 align:start position:0%
to submit a narrative report to the
 
01:41:57.950 --> 01:41:57.960 align:start position:0%
department talking about what policies
 
01:41:59.689 --> 01:41:59.699 align:start position:0%
and procedures doesn't have the word
 
01:42:01.550 --> 01:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
programs in there but Paul season
 
01:42:04.010 --> 01:42:04.020 align:start position:0%
procedures are in place to encourage
 
01:42:07.189 --> 01:42:07.199 align:start position:0%
student growth and effort and one of the
 
01:42:10.850 --> 01:42:10.860 align:start position:0%
things that um that that you know that
 
01:42:13.729 --> 01:42:13.739 align:start position:0%
that I think we've we've heard
 
01:42:16.310 --> 01:42:16.320 align:start position:0%
um during the um you know during the
 
01:42:18.590 --> 01:42:18.600 align:start position:0%
debate on the on the prior amendment I
 
01:42:18.600 --> 01:42:19.550 align:start position:0%
debate on the on the prior amendment I
mean

01:42:19.550 --> 01:42:19.560 align:start position:0%
mean
 
01:42:21.649 --> 01:42:21.659 align:start position:0%
um uh representative Shaw talked about
 
01:42:23.930 --> 01:42:23.940 align:start position:0%
well maybe we can you know offer
 
01:42:26.570 --> 01:42:26.580 align:start position:0%
something in a next year in a subsequent
 
01:42:29.689 --> 01:42:29.699 align:start position:0%
session to to expand
 
01:42:32.689 --> 01:42:32.699 align:start position:0%
um uh this and really take a look at uh
 
01:42:34.490 --> 01:42:34.500 align:start position:0%
growth and achievement and
 
01:42:36.410 --> 01:42:36.420 align:start position:0%
representative Leon talked about how
 
01:42:39.169 --> 01:42:39.179 align:start position:0%
young minds uh need to be challenged I I
 
01:42:41.570 --> 01:42:41.580 align:start position:0%
agree with it I agree with that
 
01:42:44.510 --> 01:42:44.520 align:start position:0%
um representative balm who who
 
01:42:46.970 --> 01:42:46.980 align:start position:0%
um who I talked uh you know who were
 
01:42:49.010 --> 01:42:49.020 align:start position:0%
talking about earlier talked about how
 
01:42:51.830 --> 01:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
students are working hard and um and
 
01:42:55.729 --> 01:42:55.739 align:start position:0%
this is all consistent with um with with
 
01:42:58.370 --> 01:42:58.380 align:start position:0%
the amendment um you know before you
 
01:43:01.550 --> 01:43:01.560 align:start position:0%
right now and um and just to sort of
 
01:43:05.090 --> 01:43:05.100 align:start position:0%
remind people of um of I think some some
 
01:43:09.290 --> 01:43:09.300 align:start position:0%
you know more updated uh uh studies in
 
01:43:12.410 --> 01:43:12.420 align:start position:0%
the area so so you know things that sort
 
01:43:15.350 --> 01:43:15.360 align:start position:0%
of you know take us out of the uh you
 
01:43:18.290 --> 01:43:18.300 align:start position:0%
know the 1840s and bring us into you
 
01:43:20.209 --> 01:43:20.219 align:start position:0%
know a more a better understanding a
 
01:43:22.669 --> 01:43:22.679 align:start position:0%
more up-to-date understanding about how
 
01:43:26.090 --> 01:43:26.100 align:start position:0%
the um uh how the brain works but uh you
 
01:43:28.850 --> 01:43:28.860 align:start position:0%
know Carol dweck um you know has has
 
01:43:32.450 --> 01:43:32.460 align:start position:0%
written in in her um you know her very
 
01:43:33.890 --> 01:43:33.900 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:43:37.010 --> 01:43:37.020 align:start position:0%
um well-read um uh a very much read book
 
01:43:39.350 --> 01:43:39.360 align:start position:0%
uh mindset that to the extent young
 
01:43:41.149 --> 01:43:41.159 align:start position:0%
people believe they simply have a gift
 
01:43:43.250 --> 01:43:43.260 align:start position:0%
that makes them intelligent or talented
 
01:43:45.229 --> 01:43:45.239 align:start position:0%
they may not put put in the work
 
01:43:47.930 --> 01:43:47.940 align:start position:0%
necessary to sustain that talent and
 
01:43:49.850 --> 01:43:49.860 align:start position:0%
moreover the gifted label that many
 
01:43:51.950 --> 01:43:51.960 align:start position:0%
students still receive and that their
 
01:43:54.470 --> 01:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
parents relish may turn some children
 
01:43:56.390 --> 01:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
into students who are overly cautious
 
01:43:59.990 --> 01:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
and challenge avoid avoidant and um and
 
01:44:01.430 --> 01:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
because they don't want to make mistakes
 
01:44:05.209 --> 01:44:05.219 align:start position:0%
and um and put their um uh you know and
 
01:44:08.810 --> 01:44:08.820 align:start position:0%
basically put their their gifted status
 
01:44:11.810 --> 01:44:11.820 align:start position:0%
um you know in in Jeopardy and and and
 
01:44:13.910 --> 01:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
you know when I was thinking about that
 
01:44:16.970 --> 01:44:16.980 align:start position:0%
I was I also remembered um
 
01:44:20.149 --> 01:44:20.159 align:start position:0%
you know years and years ago reading um
 
01:44:23.270 --> 01:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
outliers by Malcolm Gladwell and and I'm
 
01:44:25.250 --> 01:44:25.260 align:start position:0%
sure many of you have read read that
 
01:44:27.830 --> 01:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
book and uh and you know the the whole
 
01:44:30.290 --> 01:44:30.300 align:start position:0%
ten thousand hours thing and and I
 
01:44:32.750 --> 01:44:32.760 align:start position:0%
remember very very much you know and you
 
01:44:34.189 --> 01:44:34.199 align:start position:0%
know these quotes sort of stick with you
 
01:44:36.830 --> 01:44:36.840 align:start position:0%
I don't know if it's verbatim but um you
 
01:44:38.270 --> 01:44:38.280 align:start position:0%
know Gladwell talks about you know
 
01:44:42.709 --> 01:44:42.719 align:start position:0%
anybody that um that that works um you
 
01:44:42.719 --> 01:44:43.310 align:start position:0%
anybody that um that that works um you
know

01:44:43.310 --> 01:44:43.320 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:44:46.010 --> 01:44:46.020 align:start position:0%
um you know three thousand hours a year
 
01:44:49.129 --> 01:44:49.139 align:start position:0%
uh has never failed to to provide for
 
01:44:52.310 --> 01:44:52.320 align:start position:0%
their family and and uh so he's he
 
01:44:54.109 --> 01:44:54.119 align:start position:0%
developed this thing called the ten
 
01:44:57.050 --> 01:44:57.060 align:start position:0%
thousand you know our rule where nobody
 
01:45:00.350 --> 01:45:00.360 align:start position:0%
you know succeeds at a high level
 
01:45:04.970 --> 01:45:04.980 align:start position:0%
um uh without both the the the talent
 
01:45:08.990 --> 01:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
um and the um and getting some feedback
 
01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:13.189 align:start position:0%
um and the um and getting some feedback
there

01:45:13.189 --> 01:45:13.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:15.290 --> 01:45:15.300 align:start position:0%
anybody yeah without without
 
01:45:18.410 --> 01:45:18.420 align:start position:0%
without both the without talent but more
 
01:45:21.229 --> 01:45:21.239 align:start position:0%
importantly preparation and uh and the
 
01:45:23.629 --> 01:45:23.639 align:start position:0%
10 000 hour research reminds us that The
 
01:45:25.850 --> 01:45:25.860 align:start position:0%
Closer you know you look at careers of
 
01:45:28.669 --> 01:45:28.679 align:start position:0%
the gifted smaller the role
 
01:45:31.970 --> 01:45:31.980 align:start position:0%
um is of innate Talent seems to play in
 
01:45:34.609 --> 01:45:34.619 align:start position:0%
the bigger role preparation seems to
 
01:45:37.490 --> 01:45:37.500 align:start position:0%
play and so that's really what uh what
 
01:45:41.209 --> 01:45:41.219 align:start position:0%
amendment um 752 is is going after and
 
01:45:43.189 --> 01:45:43.199 align:start position:0%
and I certainly think it's consistent
 
01:45:46.609 --> 01:45:46.619 align:start position:0%
with the um uh with the intention that
 
01:45:48.530 --> 01:45:48.540 align:start position:0%
um you know that we that we heard from
 
01:45:52.010 --> 01:45:52.020 align:start position:0%
so many of us around the the
 
01:45:54.229 --> 01:45:54.239 align:start position:0%
um you know the virtual table here uh
 
01:45:56.270 --> 01:45:56.280 align:start position:0%
this morning thank you thank you very
 
01:45:57.830 --> 01:45:57.840 align:start position:0%
much uh represent Leon you have your
 
01:46:00.530 --> 01:46:00.540 align:start position:0%
hand up uh thank you Mr chair uh thank
 
01:46:01.970 --> 01:46:01.980 align:start position:0%
you representative Leno for this
 
01:46:04.129 --> 01:46:04.139 align:start position:0%
amendment I do agree that growth mindset
 
01:46:05.570 --> 01:46:05.580 align:start position:0%
is important
 
01:46:07.010 --> 01:46:07.020 align:start position:0%
um grittiness is important as well
 
01:46:09.350 --> 01:46:09.360 align:start position:0%
Angela Duckworth has an amazing uh
 
01:46:12.290 --> 01:46:12.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:15.050 --> 01:46:15.060 align:start position:0%
oh sorry you're not muted so Angela
 
01:46:17.149 --> 01:46:17.159 align:start position:0%
Duckworth has an amazing amazing uh
 
01:46:19.370 --> 01:46:19.380 align:start position:0%
study on Brit and the fact that it's not
 
01:46:22.430 --> 01:46:22.440 align:start position:0%
it is that growth mindset also combined
 
01:46:24.709 --> 01:46:24.719 align:start position:0%
with and with with reaching for
 
01:46:26.930 --> 01:46:26.940 align:start position:0%
extraving striving for achievement the
 
01:46:29.570 --> 01:46:29.580 align:start position:0%
10 000 hour role is very crucial but you
 
01:46:31.910 --> 01:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
also can encounter somebody who either
 
01:46:34.310 --> 01:46:34.320 align:start position:0%
has 10 000 hours where they are having
 
01:46:36.109 --> 01:46:36.119 align:start position:0%
different hours and there are people
 
01:46:38.270 --> 01:46:38.280 align:start position:0%
that have 10 000 hours where it's one
 
01:46:41.090 --> 01:46:41.100 align:start position:0%
hour repeated hour after hour after hour
 
01:46:43.010 --> 01:46:43.020 align:start position:0%
we do need to walk that line between
 
01:46:46.010 --> 01:46:46.020 align:start position:0%
growth mindset but there's right now the
 
01:46:48.109 --> 01:46:48.119 align:start position:0%
education landscape is moving away from
 
01:46:50.870 --> 01:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
that idea of performance we're moving
 
01:46:53.390 --> 01:46:53.400 align:start position:0%
away from that and we need to catch that
 
01:46:55.850 --> 01:46:55.860 align:start position:0%
if we start losing sight of excellence
 
01:46:57.890 --> 01:46:57.900 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire I know we've rewarded
 
01:47:00.290 --> 01:47:00.300 align:start position:0%
it a lot in the past but right now if
 
01:47:01.790 --> 01:47:01.800 align:start position:0%
you look at the national stage we're
 
01:47:04.370 --> 01:47:04.380 align:start position:0%
moving away from that looking not even
 
01:47:06.590 --> 01:47:06.600 align:start position:0%
towards effort because right now they're
 
01:47:08.209 --> 01:47:08.219 align:start position:0%
changing the grading system in my town
 
01:47:10.189 --> 01:47:10.199 align:start position:0%
where you can't be penalized for not
 
01:47:12.229 --> 01:47:12.239 align:start position:0%
turning in homework we need to make sure
 
01:47:14.450 --> 01:47:14.460 align:start position:0%
or the student's effort is recognized
 
01:47:15.830 --> 01:47:15.840 align:start position:0%
but we also need to make sure that
 
01:47:17.689 --> 01:47:17.699 align:start position:0%
Excellence is recognized and I think
 
01:47:19.490 --> 01:47:19.500 align:start position:0%
that simply replacing this with growth's
 
01:47:21.709 --> 01:47:21.719 align:start position:0%
mindset loses a lot of a lot of what's
 
01:47:24.590 --> 01:47:24.600 align:start position:0%
important about this I I do agree that
 
01:47:26.330 --> 01:47:26.340 align:start position:0%
that these reports would hopefully
 
01:47:28.729 --> 01:47:28.739 align:start position:0%
include efforts to encourage a growth
 
01:47:29.990 --> 01:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
mindset and I think there's such a good
 
01:47:32.209 --> 01:47:32.219 align:start position:0%
body of work uh both with what you've
 
01:47:34.490 --> 01:47:34.500 align:start position:0%
referenced with Matt Gladwell what
 
01:47:37.850 --> 01:47:37.860 align:start position:0%
you've referenced in the growth with
 
01:47:40.310 --> 01:47:40.320 align:start position:0%
Carol dweck I do believe that that's in
 
01:47:41.629 --> 01:47:41.639 align:start position:0%
the landscape we want to make sure we're
 
01:47:43.310 --> 01:47:43.320 align:start position:0%
recognizing that and being able to read
 
01:47:45.830 --> 01:47:45.840 align:start position:0%
the other school's notes will allow
 
01:47:47.270 --> 01:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
these schools to get those best
 
01:47:49.370 --> 01:47:49.380 align:start position:0%
practices and we can see how it's been
 
01:47:51.109 --> 01:47:51.119 align:start position:0%
how we're reflecting things and how
 
01:47:53.149 --> 01:47:53.159 align:start position:0%
we're doing it here in New Hampshire and
 
01:47:54.649 --> 01:47:54.659 align:start position:0%
I think that that's going to help us
 
01:47:56.990 --> 01:47:57.000 align:start position:0%
combine both that that striving for
 
01:47:59.470 --> 01:47:59.480 align:start position:0%
excellence that
 
01:48:02.330 --> 01:48:02.340 align:start position:0%
that inquisitiveness and the drive to
 
01:48:04.689 --> 01:48:04.699 align:start position:0%
work work hard even when things go wrong
 
01:48:07.790 --> 01:48:07.800 align:start position:0%
and to continue to push forward and not
 
01:48:10.430 --> 01:48:10.440 align:start position:0%
just try and rest on some some label of
 
01:48:12.770 --> 01:48:12.780 align:start position:0%
gifted but push forward and see what you
 
01:48:14.510 --> 01:48:14.520 align:start position:0%
really can do with those gifts because
 
01:48:16.669 --> 01:48:16.679 align:start position:0%
otherwise it's wasted you don't just
 
01:48:18.290 --> 01:48:18.300 align:start position:0%
take a birthday present say thank you
 
01:48:19.609 --> 01:48:19.619 align:start position:0%
and throw it out the door because you're
 
01:48:21.410 --> 01:48:21.420 align:start position:0%
afraid you're going to break the toy you
 
01:48:23.270 --> 01:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
go ahead and use it otherwise it's a
 
01:48:25.129 --> 01:48:25.139 align:start position:0%
waste and we need to make sure that that
 
01:48:27.229 --> 01:48:27.239 align:start position:0%
we're encouraging uh we're encouraging
 
01:48:28.790 --> 01:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
these kids to challenge themselves to
 
01:48:30.709 --> 01:48:30.719 align:start position:0%
fail and to fall forward instead of
 
01:48:32.510 --> 01:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
instead of not pushing themselves
 
01:48:32.520 --> 01:48:40.090 align:start position:0%
instead of not pushing themselves
forward

01:48:40.090 --> 01:48:40.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:44.450 --> 01:48:44.460 align:start position:0%
growth and effort is near and dear to my
 
01:48:44.460 --> 01:48:46.189 align:start position:0%
growth and effort is near and dear to my
heart

01:48:46.189 --> 01:48:46.199 align:start position:0%
heart
 
01:48:50.990 --> 01:48:51.000 align:start position:0%
it is probably the most important
 
01:48:55.729 --> 01:48:55.739 align:start position:0%
aspect of every child's education
 
01:48:58.370 --> 01:48:58.380 align:start position:0%
in this state
 
01:49:01.629 --> 01:49:01.639 align:start position:0%
we should always
 
01:49:04.550 --> 01:49:04.560 align:start position:0%
shouldn't always uh
 
01:49:07.070 --> 01:49:07.080 align:start position:0%
I guess the emphasis
 
01:49:10.310 --> 01:49:10.320 align:start position:0%
should always be on
 
01:49:10.320 --> 01:49:11.689 align:start position:0%
should always be on
growth

01:49:11.689 --> 01:49:11.699 align:start position:0%
growth
 
01:49:16.030 --> 01:49:16.040 align:start position:0%
on how much effort is being put into
 
01:49:18.109 --> 01:49:18.119 align:start position:0%
recognizing that
 
01:49:22.189 --> 01:49:22.199 align:start position:0%
students grow and they should be growing
 
01:49:25.490 --> 01:49:25.500 align:start position:0%
they may not all be proficient but they
 
01:49:28.850 --> 01:49:28.860 align:start position:0%
grow and growth is probably the most
 
01:49:30.470 --> 01:49:30.480 align:start position:0%
important aspect
 
01:49:34.189 --> 01:49:34.199 align:start position:0%
at every grade level in school
 
01:49:38.870 --> 01:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:40.790 --> 01:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
to me
 
01:49:43.149 --> 01:49:43.159 align:start position:0%
that should be a whole different build
 
01:49:45.970 --> 01:49:45.980 align:start position:0%
it should be a whole different
 
01:49:50.629 --> 01:49:50.639 align:start position:0%
uh it's it's a concept that I would
 
01:49:54.169 --> 01:49:54.179 align:start position:0%
support a hundred percent
 
01:49:58.729 --> 01:49:58.739 align:start position:0%
the thing is I think that this bill oh
 
01:50:02.450 --> 01:50:02.460 align:start position:0%
okay I keep eating this math
 
01:50:04.609 --> 01:50:04.619 align:start position:0%
so the
 
01:50:04.619 --> 01:50:05.930 align:start position:0%
so the
the

01:50:05.930 --> 01:50:05.940 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:50:10.070 --> 01:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
process of identifying what schools do
 
01:50:14.570 --> 01:50:14.580 align:start position:0%
for kids who are gifted and talented
 
01:50:17.530 --> 01:50:17.540 align:start position:0%
is is a not um
 
01:50:19.310 --> 01:50:19.320 align:start position:0%
a full
 
01:50:22.570 --> 01:50:22.580 align:start position:0%
it's not a full reporting about everyone
 
01:50:26.330 --> 01:50:26.340 align:start position:0%
there's just a certain certain kids that
 
01:50:31.189 --> 01:50:31.199 align:start position:0%
just stand out that okay you know uh I
 
01:50:32.990 --> 01:50:33.000 align:start position:0%
won't get into detail but I know what
 
01:50:36.109 --> 01:50:36.119 align:start position:0%
some schools do and some schools don't
 
01:50:37.910 --> 01:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
do what should do
 
01:50:43.310 --> 01:50:43.320 align:start position:0%
but I think that your amendment is a is
 
01:50:45.770 --> 01:50:45.780 align:start position:0%
an excellent bill
 
01:50:48.290 --> 01:50:48.300 align:start position:0%
that's something that should be a
 
01:50:50.689 --> 01:50:50.699 align:start position:0%
separate bill and I think it would fly
 
01:50:54.350 --> 01:50:54.360 align:start position:0%
through and stop not one person would
 
01:50:56.810 --> 01:50:56.820 align:start position:0%
disagree that growth and effort are
 
01:50:59.870 --> 01:50:59.880 align:start position:0%
probably the most important part of an
 
01:51:02.330 --> 01:51:02.340 align:start position:0%
education of a child and should be
 
01:51:02.340 --> 01:51:03.709 align:start position:0%
education of a child and should be
identified

01:51:03.709 --> 01:51:03.719 align:start position:0%
identified
 
01:51:05.810 --> 01:51:05.820 align:start position:0%
but I think this is a different thing
 
01:51:09.950 --> 01:51:09.960 align:start position:0%
it's just something for that person that
 
01:51:13.070 --> 01:51:13.080 align:start position:0%
is just a little bit above and beyond
 
01:51:16.850 --> 01:51:16.860 align:start position:0%
everything that is being taught to that
 
01:51:20.149 --> 01:51:20.159 align:start position:0%
child that this kid is just up there
 
01:51:22.490 --> 01:51:22.500 align:start position:0%
and what are you doing for this kid
 
01:51:26.030 --> 01:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
that's up there and how do you keep him
 
01:51:28.669 --> 01:51:28.679 align:start position:0%
motivated or hurt
 
01:51:32.810 --> 01:51:32.820 align:start position:0%
um that's why and I definitely am not
 
01:51:36.109 --> 01:51:36.119 align:start position:0%
talking against your amendment I think
 
01:51:38.990 --> 01:51:39.000 align:start position:0%
in regards to this bill
 
01:51:43.010 --> 01:51:43.020 align:start position:0%
it's it's not applicable in my mind as
 
01:51:47.209 --> 01:51:47.219 align:start position:0%
to what the the what the bill stands for
 
01:51:51.530 --> 01:51:51.540 align:start position:0%
and and I certainly agree with you 100 I
 
01:51:53.390 --> 01:51:53.400 align:start position:0%
love that you want to put that in for it
 
01:51:55.609 --> 01:51:55.619 align:start position:0%
build the next turn I'll support it with
 
01:51:59.050 --> 01:51:59.060 align:start position:0%
you but I I just don't think that that
 
01:52:03.470 --> 01:52:03.480 align:start position:0%
uh reducing what we are thinking about
 
01:52:06.950 --> 01:52:06.960 align:start position:0%
as gifted and talented I think we're
 
01:52:09.530 --> 01:52:09.540 align:start position:0%
making too much of what gift and
 
01:52:12.470 --> 01:52:12.480 align:start position:0%
talented it's a kid is going to stand
 
01:52:12.480 --> 01:52:13.250 align:start position:0%
talented it's a kid is going to stand
out

01:52:13.250 --> 01:52:13.260 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:52:15.590 --> 01:52:15.600 align:start position:0%
and are you doing anything for that kid
 
01:52:17.450 --> 01:52:17.460 align:start position:0%
yeah we are in our school this is what
 
01:52:20.950 --> 01:52:20.960 align:start position:0%
we do and uh so well and mentioned
 
01:52:23.390 --> 01:52:23.400 align:start position:0%
which I know you know they have a great
 
01:52:26.209 --> 01:52:26.219 align:start position:0%
program there but Manchester Central
 
01:52:29.090 --> 01:52:29.100 align:start position:0%
does it Northwest Elementary doesn't you
 
01:52:30.470 --> 01:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
know we
 
01:52:32.689 --> 01:52:32.699 align:start position:0%
I don't know what they're doing
 
01:52:36.530 --> 01:52:36.540 align:start position:0%
so that's that's the difference and and
 
01:52:39.350 --> 01:52:39.360 align:start position:0%
I certainly uh I love that Amendment
 
01:52:41.570 --> 01:52:41.580 align:start position:0%
save it for a bill
 
01:52:44.030 --> 01:52:44.040 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much uh
 
01:52:45.470 --> 01:52:45.480 align:start position:0%
represent like this you have your hand
 
01:52:48.530 --> 01:52:48.540 align:start position:0%
up yeah I had a number of points
 
01:52:50.930 --> 01:52:50.940 align:start position:0%
um with that and I absolutely agree with
 
01:52:54.590 --> 01:52:54.600 align:start position:0%
with uh representative Shaw I was
 
01:52:57.109 --> 01:52:57.119 align:start position:0%
wondering at first as if we could just
 
01:52:59.930 --> 01:52:59.940 align:start position:0%
add the two together and have one
 
01:53:02.629 --> 01:53:02.639 align:start position:0%
amendment that did both but then I'm not
 
01:53:04.609 --> 01:53:04.619 align:start position:0%
sure this wouldn't be a non-germaine
 
01:53:06.350 --> 01:53:06.360 align:start position:0%
Amendment so perhaps it is better to
 
01:53:08.450 --> 01:53:08.460 align:start position:0%
have it as a separate bill I really like
 
01:53:11.090 --> 01:53:11.100 align:start position:0%
this I think this is important
 
01:53:13.790 --> 01:53:13.800 align:start position:0%
um I would hate for it to be lost but I
 
01:53:15.410 --> 01:53:15.420 align:start position:0%
don't want to lose the gifted and
 
01:53:17.750 --> 01:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
talented one as well there's talking
 
01:53:20.209 --> 01:53:20.219 align:start position:0%
about two different things and the other
 
01:53:22.550 --> 01:53:22.560 align:start position:0%
part with regard to the however many
 
01:53:26.689 --> 01:53:26.699 align:start position:0%
hours I did listen to a sports a
 
01:53:28.430 --> 01:53:28.440 align:start position:0%
medicine specialist who worked with
 
01:53:31.550 --> 01:53:31.560 align:start position:0%
professionals and he said yes there is
 
01:53:33.290 --> 01:53:33.300 align:start position:0%
an element of that but you can't just
 
01:53:36.010 --> 01:53:36.020 align:start position:0%
have that you have to have that
 
01:53:38.330 --> 01:53:38.340 align:start position:0%
underlying whatever and he was talking
 
01:53:40.609 --> 01:53:40.619 align:start position:0%
about for athletes
 
01:53:40.619 --> 01:53:41.330 align:start position:0%
about for athletes
um

01:53:41.330 --> 01:53:41.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:44.030 --> 01:53:44.040 align:start position:0%
for professional basketball players you
 
01:53:45.709 --> 01:53:45.719 align:start position:0%
couldn't have a short person they just
 
01:53:48.169 --> 01:53:48.179 align:start position:0%
weren't going to make it and almost all
 
01:53:50.750 --> 01:53:50.760 align:start position:0%
basketball players their arms compared
 
01:53:52.310 --> 01:53:52.320 align:start position:0%
to their height their arms are longer
 
01:53:53.570 --> 01:53:53.580 align:start position:0%
than their height compared to everybody
 
01:53:57.290 --> 01:53:57.300 align:start position:0%
else so so yeah you still have some
 
01:53:59.750 --> 01:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
underlying something that then with the
 
01:54:02.450 --> 01:54:02.460 align:start position:0%
5 000 hours or however many hours I
 
01:54:05.209 --> 01:54:05.219 align:start position:0%
forget it was we'll make that person so
 
01:54:07.609 --> 01:54:07.619 align:start position:0%
you need both you can't do it with just
 
01:54:11.510 --> 01:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
one you need both and so this is helping
 
01:54:14.330 --> 01:54:14.340 align:start position:0%
out the gifted one would be helping our
 
01:54:17.030 --> 01:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
students who had the extra long arms or
 
01:54:19.850 --> 01:54:19.860 align:start position:0%
the whatever that underlying thing is to
 
01:54:22.189 --> 01:54:22.199 align:start position:0%
spend those 5 000 hours and reach that
 
01:54:25.129 --> 01:54:25.139 align:start position:0%
potential but um so I'd like to see them
 
01:54:27.830 --> 01:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
both go through and the other thing was
 
01:54:30.470 --> 01:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
just a comment that somehow an awful lot
 
01:54:33.729 --> 01:54:33.739 align:start position:0%
of people made made
 
01:54:36.530 --> 01:54:36.540 align:start position:0%
references to the fact that having these
 
01:54:39.229 --> 01:54:39.239 align:start position:0%
reports are worthless or won't go
 
01:54:41.390 --> 01:54:41.400 align:start position:0%
anywhere or we'll just sit at the doe
 
01:54:41.400 --> 01:54:43.370 align:start position:0%
anywhere or we'll just sit at the doe
and

01:54:43.370 --> 01:54:43.380 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:54:47.209 --> 01:54:47.219 align:start position:0%
they're not specific enough Etc and to
 
01:54:50.390 --> 01:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
those people I would say this amendment
 
01:54:52.430 --> 01:54:52.440 align:start position:0%
is the same way I didn't agree before
 
01:54:54.470 --> 01:54:54.480 align:start position:0%
and I don't think it's so with this
 
01:54:57.410 --> 01:54:57.420 align:start position:0%
amendment either I think either in
 
01:54:58.810 --> 01:54:58.820 align:start position:0%
either case
 
01:55:01.910 --> 01:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
filing the policies I mean filing the
 
01:55:03.410 --> 01:55:03.420 align:start position:0%
the letters
 
01:55:06.590 --> 01:55:06.600 align:start position:0%
the reports will be useful and I think
 
01:55:08.390 --> 01:55:08.400 align:start position:0%
that just thinking about it will be
 
01:55:10.910 --> 01:55:10.920 align:start position:0%
useful so
 
01:55:13.850 --> 01:55:13.860 align:start position:0%
so I would say that this if you're going
 
01:55:16.070 --> 01:55:16.080 align:start position:0%
to support this you should support the
 
01:55:17.629 --> 01:55:17.639 align:start position:0%
other one as well
 
01:55:20.570 --> 01:55:20.580 align:start position:0%
I have the chair yes go ahead thanks
 
01:55:22.370 --> 01:55:22.380 align:start position:0%
very much Rick
 
01:55:24.590 --> 01:55:24.600 align:start position:0%
um uh I I think what representative
 
01:55:26.629 --> 01:55:26.639 align:start position:0%
Legas suggested
 
01:55:28.490 --> 01:55:28.500 align:start position:0%
um makes a lot of sense I would support
 
01:55:31.270 --> 01:55:31.280 align:start position:0%
that uh if we were somehow able to
 
01:55:34.370 --> 01:55:34.380 align:start position:0%
combine these two into uh into a single
 
01:55:35.990 --> 01:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
committee Amendment
 
01:55:38.090 --> 01:55:38.100 align:start position:0%
um whether it's just sort of glomming on
 
01:55:39.950 --> 01:55:39.960 align:start position:0%
one after the other or weaving them
 
01:55:41.930 --> 01:55:41.940 align:start position:0%
together it doesn't matter
 
01:55:44.149 --> 01:55:44.159 align:start position:0%
um uh to me but would the chair accept
 
01:55:47.330 --> 01:55:47.340 align:start position:0%
that as a Germaine Amendment
 
01:55:51.410 --> 01:55:51.420 align:start position:0%
it's a clerk well basically Germaine
 
01:55:53.629 --> 01:55:53.639 align:start position:0%
Amendment you know I I couldn't do that
 
01:55:55.189 --> 01:55:55.199 align:start position:0%
right now without taking a little time
 
01:55:57.890 --> 01:55:57.900 align:start position:0%
and looking at this more thoroughly uh I
 
01:56:00.530 --> 01:56:00.540 align:start position:0%
I just read the amendment over briefly
 
01:56:02.570 --> 01:56:02.580 align:start position:0%
just not more than five to ten seconds
 
01:56:02.580 --> 01:56:04.070 align:start position:0%
just not more than five to ten seconds
ago

01:56:04.070 --> 01:56:04.080 align:start position:0%
ago
 
01:56:04.080 --> 01:56:05.090 align:start position:0%
ago
um

01:56:05.090 --> 01:56:05.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:07.490 --> 01:56:07.500 align:start position:0%
I I think what we're trying to do here
 
01:56:11.510 --> 01:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
is that we're going further than what
 
01:56:13.850 --> 01:56:13.860 align:start position:0%
the initial intent of Representative
 
01:56:16.910 --> 01:56:16.920 align:start position:0%
moffett's bill is and that's just to get
 
01:56:18.770 --> 01:56:18.780 align:start position:0%
a better understanding what we're doing
 
01:56:21.830 --> 01:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
as far as providing uh
 
01:56:25.910 --> 01:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
support our programs our education for
 
01:56:28.850 --> 01:56:28.860 align:start position:0%
our gifted and talented kids in the
 
01:56:30.410 --> 01:56:30.420 align:start position:0%
state what what do we have out there
 
01:56:31.970 --> 01:56:31.980 align:start position:0%
what are some of the practices that are
 
01:56:34.729 --> 01:56:34.739 align:start position:0%
going on right now when we get that then
 
01:56:36.590 --> 01:56:36.600 align:start position:0%
I think we're going to have to dig
 
01:56:36.600 --> 01:56:38.270 align:start position:0%
I think we're going to have to dig
deeper

01:56:38.270 --> 01:56:38.280 align:start position:0%
deeper
 
01:56:40.430 --> 01:56:40.440 align:start position:0%
um I've always been an advocate for
 
01:56:43.970 --> 01:56:43.980 align:start position:0%
working with kids that are gifted and
 
01:56:46.250 --> 01:56:46.260 align:start position:0%
talented and there's a lot of criteria
 
01:56:48.890 --> 01:56:48.900 align:start position:0%
you can go into you know look at growth
 
01:56:51.649 --> 01:56:51.659 align:start position:0%
and you can look at effort
 
01:56:55.189 --> 01:56:55.199 align:start position:0%
um that's important uh obviously so a
 
01:56:56.750 --> 01:56:56.760 align:start position:0%
lot of the kids which are counted
 
01:56:59.810 --> 01:56:59.820 align:start position:0%
properly become Behavior phones and so
 
01:57:01.430 --> 01:57:01.440 align:start position:0%
there's probably a correlation between
 
01:57:04.729 --> 01:57:04.739 align:start position:0%
programs which have a
 
01:57:07.010 --> 01:57:07.020 align:start position:0%
a best practice available for the
 
01:57:09.709 --> 01:57:09.719 align:start position:0%
students or have a challenging courses
 
01:57:12.290 --> 01:57:12.300 align:start position:0%
available in which they can sequel the
 
01:57:14.030 --> 01:57:14.040 align:start position:0%
kid is bored they're not going to have
 
01:57:16.010 --> 01:57:16.020 align:start position:0%
growth but that doesn't mean you don't
 
01:57:18.169 --> 01:57:18.179 align:start position:0%
have a gifted kid here if you have a
 
01:57:19.669 --> 01:57:19.679 align:start position:0%
gifted kid that's chosen to go the
 
01:57:21.050 --> 01:57:21.060 align:start position:0%
opposite direction
 
01:57:25.010 --> 01:57:25.020 align:start position:0%
so traditional programs have looked at
 
01:57:26.750 --> 01:57:26.760 align:start position:0%
this and used a whole lot of different
 
01:57:28.729 --> 01:57:28.739 align:start position:0%
criteria for identifying gifted
 
01:57:31.729 --> 01:57:31.739 align:start position:0%
mentality specifically gifted leadership
 
01:57:34.750 --> 01:57:34.760 align:start position:0%
skills achievement scores
 
01:57:37.270 --> 01:57:37.280 align:start position:0%
IQ scores
 
01:57:39.530 --> 01:57:39.540 align:start position:0%
recommendations of folks that they work
 
01:57:42.050 --> 01:57:42.060 align:start position:0%
with and creativity I think that's a
 
01:57:43.910 --> 01:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
very important one
 
01:57:47.870 --> 01:57:47.880 align:start position:0%
um so uh I I at this point in time I
 
01:57:51.709 --> 01:57:51.719 align:start position:0%
would say that the amendment is going to
 
01:57:54.290 --> 01:57:54.300 align:start position:0%
go in a different direction they're
 
01:57:56.870 --> 01:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
inclusive yes but I I don't think it
 
01:57:59.390 --> 01:57:59.400 align:start position:0%
really the purpose the intent of the
 
01:58:04.490 --> 01:58:04.500 align:start position:0%
bill was just not to try to uh
 
01:58:06.950 --> 01:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
Define this thing at all we're just
 
01:58:08.930 --> 01:58:08.940 align:start position:0%
trying to find out how the local
 
01:58:12.530 --> 01:58:12.540 align:start position:0%
districts Define gifted or talented and
 
01:58:14.390 --> 01:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
what programs they're offering I think
 
01:58:17.089 --> 01:58:17.099 align:start position:0%
the next step uh Russia would be for you
 
01:58:20.689 --> 01:58:20.699 align:start position:0%
to introduce your bill and probably get
 
01:58:23.149 --> 01:58:23.159 align:start position:0%
down further in the weeds even and try
 
01:58:24.890 --> 01:58:24.900 align:start position:0%
to identify we're going to go with
 
01:58:27.189 --> 01:58:27.199 align:start position:0%
programs for these kids
 
01:58:30.530 --> 01:58:30.540 align:start position:0%
and and that's uh are we going to do it
 
01:58:32.149 --> 01:58:32.159 align:start position:0%
in the traditional mode are we going to
 
01:58:33.830 --> 01:58:33.840 align:start position:0%
do it in more of a non-traditional mode
 
01:58:36.649 --> 01:58:36.659 align:start position:0%
that you're in right now
 
01:58:38.930 --> 01:58:38.940 align:start position:0%
um it's it's not just for those kids on
 
01:58:42.290 --> 01:58:42.300 align:start position:0%
the right hand side of the bell curve
 
01:58:45.709 --> 01:58:45.719 align:start position:0%
it's for you you can have kids that are
 
01:58:47.330 --> 01:58:47.340 align:start position:0%
gifted in so many different ways that
 
01:58:50.330 --> 01:58:50.340 align:start position:0%
are not identified to achievement uh so
 
01:58:52.430 --> 01:58:52.440 align:start position:0%
at this point in time I'm not prepared
 
01:58:54.589 --> 01:58:54.599 align:start position:0%
to say that it's not germane or it is
 
01:58:56.209 --> 01:58:56.219 align:start position:0%
germane I just don't think it's
 
01:58:58.070 --> 01:58:58.080 align:start position:0%
appropriate to be adding on to that
 
01:59:00.290 --> 01:59:00.300 align:start position:0%
legislation I don't think it agrees with
 
01:59:02.270 --> 01:59:02.280 align:start position:0%
the intent of what uh represent
 
01:59:03.950 --> 01:59:03.960 align:start position:0%
moffett's trying to do
 
01:59:08.810 --> 01:59:08.820 align:start position:0%
okay Mr chair last month so so you we've
 
01:59:11.209 --> 01:59:11.219 align:start position:0%
been um we've been debating this for I
 
01:59:12.410 --> 01:59:12.420 align:start position:0%
don't know I didn't see when we started
 
01:59:14.089 --> 01:59:14.099 align:start position:0%
but let's just say it's been about an
 
01:59:15.530 --> 01:59:15.540 align:start position:0%
hour or more
 
01:59:18.830 --> 01:59:18.840 align:start position:0%
um and um and the way it looks you know
 
01:59:22.189 --> 01:59:22.199 align:start position:0%
to me to the way it looks right now is
 
01:59:26.689 --> 01:59:26.699 align:start position:0%
that um is that this bill uh uh would
 
01:59:28.609 --> 01:59:28.619 align:start position:0%
probably pass I don't think it'll wind
 
01:59:30.470 --> 01:59:30.480 align:start position:0%
up on the consent calendar and I think
 
01:59:32.270 --> 01:59:32.280 align:start position:0%
they'll probably be a Minority Report in
 
01:59:34.669 --> 01:59:34.679 align:start position:0%
a four fight
 
01:59:36.109 --> 01:59:36.119 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:59:41.089 --> 01:59:41.099 align:start position:0%
and I I guess I'm I'm wondering and it
 
01:59:44.270 --> 01:59:44.280 align:start position:0%
sounds like there may be support for a
 
01:59:44.280 --> 01:59:44.870 align:start position:0%
sounds like there may be support for a
um

01:59:44.870 --> 01:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:47.209 --> 01:59:47.219 align:start position:0%
um for an amendment that that unites
 
01:59:48.890 --> 01:59:48.900 align:start position:0%
both of these
 
01:59:50.930 --> 01:59:50.940 align:start position:0%
um Concepts and I think we're going to
 
01:59:54.050 --> 01:59:54.060 align:start position:0%
be coming back on Thursday and for an
 
01:59:56.629 --> 01:59:56.639 align:start position:0%
exact session and we could you know
 
01:59:58.669 --> 01:59:58.679 align:start position:0%
introduce that
 
02:00:00.709 --> 02:00:00.719 align:start position:0%
um uh hopefully not have not have to
 
02:00:02.510 --> 02:00:02.520 align:start position:0%
have a protracted debate on it because I
 
02:00:04.850 --> 02:00:04.860 align:start position:0%
think we've done that this morning and
 
02:00:07.129 --> 02:00:07.139 align:start position:0%
have something and I don't want to I'm
 
02:00:08.149 --> 02:00:08.159 align:start position:0%
not trying to get in front of
 
02:00:10.070 --> 02:00:10.080 align:start position:0%
Representative Miler here but have
 
02:00:11.570 --> 02:00:11.580 align:start position:0%
something that possibly goes on the
 
02:00:13.250 --> 02:00:13.260 align:start position:0%
consent calendar
 
02:00:13.260 --> 02:00:15.950 align:start position:0%
consent calendar
yeah

02:00:15.950 --> 02:00:15.960 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:00:20.510 --> 02:00:20.520 align:start position:0%
if I may uh Mr chair is it possible
 
02:00:24.770 --> 02:00:24.780 align:start position:0%
to recess this until next Thursday and
 
02:00:26.930 --> 02:00:26.940 align:start position:0%
in the in interim as we've done with
 
02:00:29.570 --> 02:00:29.580 align:start position:0%
several other bills the interim to see
 
02:00:31.550 --> 02:00:31.560 align:start position:0%
if there's a way with which we could
 
02:00:36.189 --> 02:00:36.199 align:start position:0%
merge representative luno's uh concepts
 
02:00:38.930 --> 02:00:38.940 align:start position:0%
with uh representative moffatt and have
 
02:00:41.030 --> 02:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
the two of them get together to see if
 
02:00:42.530 --> 02:00:42.540 align:start position:0%
there's a way that we might be able to
 
02:00:47.149 --> 02:00:47.159 align:start position:0%
capture uh the uh the intent of both of
 
02:00:49.550 --> 02:00:49.560 align:start position:0%
these uh proposals so that we could
 
02:00:52.010 --> 02:00:52.020 align:start position:0%
place this on the consent calendar and
 
02:00:54.109 --> 02:00:54.119 align:start position:0%
move it forward because this has been a
 
02:00:55.850 --> 02:00:55.860 align:start position:0%
substantive conversation that we've just
 
02:00:59.689 --> 02:00:59.699 align:start position:0%
had and I think uh it would be more
 
02:01:03.950 --> 02:01:03.960 align:start position:0%
inclusive of being able to engage the
 
02:01:07.070 --> 02:01:07.080 align:start position:0%
process so that we could be broader and
 
02:01:09.229 --> 02:01:09.239 align:start position:0%
and to look at this because it I think
 
02:01:11.030 --> 02:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
it would send a much broader message a
 
02:01:13.430 --> 02:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
much more direct message about the need
 
02:01:16.010 --> 02:01:16.020 align:start position:0%
to really address this across the board
 
02:01:18.169 --> 02:01:18.179 align:start position:0%
could that happen
 
02:01:20.930 --> 02:01:20.940 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I'm going to first have uh
 
02:01:22.970 --> 02:01:22.980 align:start position:0%
representative respond
 
02:01:26.149 --> 02:01:26.159 align:start position:0%
you sure thank you Mr chair uh and I
 
02:01:27.589 --> 02:01:27.599 align:start position:0%
have to point out there is a motion
 
02:01:29.689 --> 02:01:29.699 align:start position:0%
that's been seconded that's that's on
 
02:01:32.450 --> 02:01:32.460 align:start position:0%
the on the floor uh I think
 
02:01:34.430 --> 02:01:34.440 align:start position:0%
representative lunos thoughts uh a
 
02:01:36.350 --> 02:01:36.360 align:start position:0%
striking chord with all of this and I
 
02:01:40.250 --> 02:01:40.260 align:start position:0%
think that uh what he is looking at is
 
02:01:43.070 --> 02:01:43.080 align:start position:0%
something that deserves more discussion
 
02:01:44.870 --> 02:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
I don't think it deserves at this moment
 
02:01:48.649 --> 02:01:48.659 align:start position:0%
and I do have to point out that uh the
 
02:01:50.330 --> 02:01:50.340 align:start position:0%
the arguments that were expressed
 
02:01:52.850 --> 02:01:52.860 align:start position:0%
earlier against the First Amendment uh
 
02:01:54.830 --> 02:01:54.840 align:start position:0%
certainly all would apply against the
 
02:01:56.390 --> 02:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
the Second Amendment I think that's
 
02:01:58.970 --> 02:01:58.980 align:start position:0%
that's very interesting
 
02:02:02.149 --> 02:02:02.159 align:start position:0%
um and I do want to also point out that
 
02:02:04.430 --> 02:02:04.440 align:start position:0%
uh we have been talking about this for a
 
02:02:08.089 --> 02:02:08.099 align:start position:0%
long time and uh that is actually the
 
02:02:10.129 --> 02:02:10.139 align:start position:0%
beauty of the intent of the original
 
02:02:15.290 --> 02:02:15.300 align:start position:0%
bill was simply to uh facilitate and
 
02:02:18.109 --> 02:02:18.119 align:start position:0%
create a long overdue discussion on this
 
02:02:21.290 --> 02:02:21.300 align:start position:0%
topic of an underserved population
 
02:02:24.229 --> 02:02:24.239 align:start position:0%
uh and so I think in microcosm you're
 
02:02:28.070 --> 02:02:28.080 align:start position:0%
seeing what will what if this bill is
 
02:02:29.990 --> 02:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
amended moves forward happen all over
 
02:02:32.629 --> 02:02:32.639 align:start position:0%
the state will be this very type of a
 
02:02:35.410 --> 02:02:35.420 align:start position:0%
healthy discussion will happen in
 
02:02:37.729 --> 02:02:37.739 align:start position:0%
healthy and overdue discussion will
 
02:02:39.410 --> 02:02:39.420 align:start position:0%
happen uh Statewide
 
02:02:41.810 --> 02:02:41.820 align:start position:0%
uh representative Mullen pointed out
 
02:02:44.570 --> 02:02:44.580 align:start position:0%
what Bedford is doing I think that's
 
02:02:47.810 --> 02:02:47.820 align:start position:0%
precisely uh what we would like to get
 
02:02:50.209 --> 02:02:50.219 align:start position:0%
into this this best practices folder
 
02:02:53.209 --> 02:02:53.219 align:start position:0%
because bedford's doing some things that
 
02:02:55.430 --> 02:02:55.440 align:start position:0%
I think uh we should shine a light on
 
02:02:57.890 --> 02:02:57.900 align:start position:0%
for other other schools to or districts
 
02:03:00.109 --> 02:03:00.119 align:start position:0%
to consider so anyway there is a motion
 
02:03:02.890 --> 02:03:02.900 align:start position:0%
on the floor I think that needs to be
 
02:03:05.870 --> 02:03:05.880 align:start position:0%
addressed and then um we could go from
 
02:03:09.530 --> 02:03:09.540 align:start position:0%
there I'll represented by Ford
 
02:03:12.709 --> 02:03:12.719 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh I was wondering
 
02:03:15.530 --> 02:03:15.540 align:start position:0%
if maybe there are two issues here that
 
02:03:18.830 --> 02:03:18.840 align:start position:0%
we need to separate and one I I took a
 
02:03:20.870 --> 02:03:20.880 align:start position:0%
particular notice of the people who
 
02:03:23.689 --> 02:03:23.699 align:start position:0%
spoke in terms of getting the Department
 
02:03:26.390 --> 02:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
of Education to make a response and I
 
02:03:29.390 --> 02:03:29.400 align:start position:0%
may be the simpler solution for that is
 
02:03:30.530 --> 02:03:30.540 align:start position:0%
to Simply
 
02:03:34.550 --> 02:03:34.560 align:start position:0%
modify uh the original motion to an
 
02:03:37.850 --> 02:03:37.860 align:start position:0%
accrued a request of the Department of
 
02:03:40.790 --> 02:03:40.800 align:start position:0%
Education from the legislature to give
 
02:03:43.850 --> 02:03:43.860 align:start position:0%
us their analysis of this
 
02:03:46.189 --> 02:03:46.199 align:start position:0%
and therefore that would invite them and
 
02:03:48.109 --> 02:03:48.119 align:start position:0%
I don't see how they could politely
 
02:03:51.229 --> 02:03:51.239 align:start position:0%
refuse us to make an analysis of what
 
02:03:53.390 --> 02:03:53.400 align:start position:0%
we're introducing here and then follow
 
02:03:56.390 --> 02:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
along simultaneously or subsequently
 
02:03:59.149 --> 02:03:59.159 align:start position:0%
with an analysis of the sort that
 
02:04:01.669 --> 02:04:01.679 align:start position:0%
representative luno has suggested which
 
02:04:03.649 --> 02:04:03.659 align:start position:0%
has a great deal of Merit
 
02:04:06.290 --> 02:04:06.300 align:start position:0%
so I'm just trying to look to sort of
 
02:04:08.030 --> 02:04:08.040 align:start position:0%
through the how to work our way through
 
02:04:09.350 --> 02:04:09.360 align:start position:0%
the weeds here
 
02:04:11.149 --> 02:04:11.159 align:start position:0%
that that's what I'm raising this
 
02:04:13.129 --> 02:04:13.139 align:start position:0%
question for I think there have been a
 
02:04:15.890 --> 02:04:15.900 align:start position:0%
wonderful number of of just points of
 
02:04:17.270 --> 02:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
view on this and it's been very
 
02:04:17.280 --> 02:04:22.209 align:start position:0%
view on this and it's been very
enlightening

02:04:22.209 --> 02:04:22.219 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:25.609 --> 02:04:25.619 align:start position:0%
has previously been done uh we you don't
 
02:04:28.970 --> 02:04:28.980 align:start position:0%
have to amend the motion to uh achieve
 
02:04:31.609 --> 02:04:31.619 align:start position:0%
what you're trying to address it can't
 
02:04:34.790 --> 02:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
be done through an administrative uh uh
 
02:04:37.729 --> 02:04:37.739 align:start position:0%
request from this committee to the
 
02:04:40.609 --> 02:04:40.619 align:start position:0%
Department of Education to uh you know
 
02:04:43.370 --> 02:04:43.380 align:start position:0%
let's let's delve into this issue Let's
 
02:04:46.669 --> 02:04:46.679 align:start position:0%
uh have some information provided by you
 
02:04:48.890 --> 02:04:48.900 align:start position:0%
um we've done that before I can remember
 
02:04:50.930 --> 02:04:50.940 align:start position:0%
doing that with representative guy or
 
02:04:54.770 --> 02:04:54.780 align:start position:0%
several years ago and we we did some uh
 
02:04:57.770 --> 02:04:57.780 align:start position:0%
uh issue addressed issues such as this
 
02:05:00.050 --> 02:05:00.060 align:start position:0%
uh without having to do it even with a
 
02:05:02.750 --> 02:05:02.760 align:start position:0%
bill we we did it uh just as an
 
02:05:04.310 --> 02:05:04.320 align:start position:0%
administrative request from this
 
02:05:07.250 --> 02:05:07.260 align:start position:0%
committee to the department to get down
 
02:05:10.910 --> 02:05:10.920 align:start position:0%
to and find some answers to various
 
02:05:14.629 --> 02:05:14.639 align:start position:0%
topics I think we can do that but what
 
02:05:16.490 --> 02:05:16.500 align:start position:0%
I'd like to do before I go any further
 
02:05:17.870 --> 02:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
than this there's a couple people with
 
02:05:19.910 --> 02:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
hands up here where I'm saying Leon do
 
02:05:22.010 --> 02:05:22.020 align:start position:0%
you have a question
 
02:05:24.229 --> 02:05:24.239 align:start position:0%
um I have a point Mr chair if I may make
 
02:05:26.870 --> 02:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
it I think that the growth mindset is is
 
02:05:29.629 --> 02:05:29.639 align:start position:0%
a very important uh issue too but if we
 
02:05:31.490 --> 02:05:31.500 align:start position:0%
have them together sort of in a joint
 
02:05:34.129 --> 02:05:34.139 align:start position:0%
question that's going to make it harder
 
02:05:35.870 --> 02:05:35.880 align:start position:0%
for it's going to make it easy for
 
02:05:38.149 --> 02:05:38.159 align:start position:0%
districts or schools to only focus where
 
02:05:39.709 --> 02:05:39.719 align:start position:0%
they are at a strong if we're already
 
02:05:41.689 --> 02:05:41.699 align:start position:0%
strong on encouraging a growth mindset
 
02:05:43.310 --> 02:05:43.320 align:start position:0%
that's what they'll address and then say
 
02:05:45.290 --> 02:05:45.300 align:start position:0%
that the growth mindset helps the gift
 
02:05:46.490 --> 02:05:46.500 align:start position:0%
of students if they're already strong
 
02:05:48.109 --> 02:05:48.119 align:start position:0%
enough strong on gifted students but
 
02:05:49.430 --> 02:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
they aren't encouraging that growth
 
02:05:51.350 --> 02:05:51.360 align:start position:0%
mindset they may do the same thing where
 
02:05:53.149 --> 02:05:53.159 align:start position:0%
they point out those programs and gloss
 
02:05:56.390 --> 02:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
over the the growth mindset I think that
 
02:05:57.950 --> 02:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
these should come forth in separate
 
02:05:59.750 --> 02:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
years because I think this is a
 
02:06:01.910 --> 02:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
wonderful absolutely wonderful idea
 
02:06:04.189 --> 02:06:04.199 align:start position:0%
representative luno but I think that if
 
02:06:06.169 --> 02:06:06.179 align:start position:0%
Leslie's come forward separately it's
 
02:06:07.370 --> 02:06:07.380 align:start position:0%
going to be too easy for them to get
 
02:06:08.810 --> 02:06:08.820 align:start position:0%
Blended together and we're going to lose
 
02:06:10.310 --> 02:06:10.320 align:start position:0%
we're going to lose the benefit that
 
02:06:13.149 --> 02:06:13.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:15.649 --> 02:06:15.659 align:start position:0%
yeah just uh
 
02:06:17.990 --> 02:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
first part of the amendment sounds good
 
02:06:19.910 --> 02:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
as everybody can sing but
 
02:06:22.010 --> 02:06:22.020 align:start position:0%
read the next part of the amendment
 
02:06:25.970 --> 02:06:25.980 align:start position:0%
completely replaces the bill
 
02:06:28.490 --> 02:06:28.500 align:start position:0%
I just want to make that clear it
 
02:06:28.500 --> 02:06:29.810 align:start position:0%
I just want to make that clear it
replaces

02:06:29.810 --> 02:06:29.820 align:start position:0%
replaces
 
02:06:34.330 --> 02:06:34.340 align:start position:0%
that completely replaces 20 ads New
 
02:06:38.109 --> 02:06:38.119 align:start position:0%
189.29 B which is replaces
 
02:06:40.850 --> 02:06:40.860 align:start position:0%
so I just want to make that clear so I
 
02:06:42.770 --> 02:06:42.780 align:start position:0%
will be against
 
02:06:44.169 --> 02:06:44.179 align:start position:0%
it thank you
 
02:06:47.390 --> 02:06:47.400 align:start position:0%
uh represent luno thanks very much Mr
 
02:06:49.609 --> 02:06:49.619 align:start position:0%
chair representative Bloom is is correct
 
02:06:52.970 --> 02:06:52.980 align:start position:0%
the amendment does replace the um uh the
 
02:06:55.250 --> 02:06:55.260 align:start position:0%
bill and um and I think representative
 
02:06:56.750 --> 02:06:56.760 align:start position:0%
Leon's Point
 
02:07:02.270 --> 02:07:02.280 align:start position:0%
um is um is also uh uh on spot and um uh
 
02:07:04.910 --> 02:07:04.920 align:start position:0%
but I think could be accomplished with a
 
02:07:07.010 --> 02:07:07.020 align:start position:0%
um with a with a committee amendment
 
02:07:11.209 --> 02:07:11.219 align:start position:0%
that um that tackles these two uh issues
 
02:07:14.410 --> 02:07:14.420 align:start position:0%
as separate points a b
 
02:07:19.850 --> 02:07:19.860 align:start position:0%
29-b and 29 I'm assuming there's no 29-c
 
02:07:22.970 --> 02:07:22.980 align:start position:0%
um so um so this part could be um could
 
02:07:25.850 --> 02:07:25.860 align:start position:0%
be brought in as 29c and require
 
02:07:29.510 --> 02:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
districts to uh to report out on both
 
02:07:31.970 --> 02:07:31.980 align:start position:0%
um uh I think I I agree I think they are
 
02:07:31.980 --> 02:07:33.290 align:start position:0%
um uh I think I I agree I think they are
related

02:07:33.290 --> 02:07:33.300 align:start position:0%
related
 
02:07:35.270 --> 02:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
um you know in terms of making sure that
 
02:07:37.490 --> 02:07:37.500 align:start position:0%
school districts are challenging uh
 
02:07:40.790 --> 02:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
students and um and and you know
 
02:07:43.970 --> 02:07:43.980 align:start position:0%
collectively we should be able to get a
 
02:07:46.010 --> 02:07:46.020 align:start position:0%
um the the department I'm sorry should
 
02:07:49.970 --> 02:07:49.980 align:start position:0%
be able to uh to get a um a rich Trove
 
02:07:53.930 --> 02:07:53.940 align:start position:0%
of um of practice data from uh from
 
02:07:56.149 --> 02:07:56.159 align:start position:0%
school districts across the state so
 
02:07:59.750 --> 02:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
again I think a um uh a
 
02:08:01.370 --> 02:08:01.380 align:start position:0%
you know a
 
02:08:03.770 --> 02:08:03.780 align:start position:0%
an amendment a committee amendment that
 
02:08:07.310 --> 02:08:07.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't blend the two but has the two
 
02:08:13.310 --> 02:08:13.320 align:start position:0%
um in series uh as 29b uh for um for
 
02:08:16.669 --> 02:08:16.679 align:start position:0%
um gifted and talented and 29c for
 
02:08:19.070 --> 02:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
encouragement of growth and effort I
 
02:08:22.189 --> 02:08:22.199 align:start position:0%
think is very consistent and um and and
 
02:08:24.229 --> 02:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
I think is it would be a good outcome
 
02:08:26.930 --> 02:08:26.940 align:start position:0%
from the the investment of time and
 
02:08:28.970 --> 02:08:28.980 align:start position:0%
discussion that this committee has put
 
02:08:35.410 --> 02:08:35.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:40.250 --> 02:08:40.260 align:start position:0%
okay uh are there any other uh concerns
 
02:08:44.209 --> 02:08:44.219 align:start position:0%
questions uh from the committee
 
02:08:46.189 --> 02:08:46.199 align:start position:0%
okay what I'm going to do is I'm going
 
02:08:48.770 --> 02:08:48.780 align:start position:0%
to call a brief caucus so I can talk
 
02:08:52.850 --> 02:08:52.860 align:start position:0%
with uh folks I have here who are about
 
02:08:56.330 --> 02:08:56.340 align:start position:0%
15 minutes I came in unfortunately you
 
02:08:59.270 --> 02:08:59.280 align:start position:0%
know halfway through this thing and so
 
02:09:01.490 --> 02:09:01.500 align:start position:0%
I'd like to get a better understanding
 
02:09:04.490 --> 02:09:04.500 align:start position:0%
of it myself so uh 15 minutes we'll come
 
02:09:07.250 --> 02:09:07.260 align:start position:0%
back at 11 30. does he have to do the
 
02:09:09.830 --> 02:09:09.840 align:start position:0%
recess we have a motion there's a motion
 
02:09:12.310 --> 02:09:12.320 align:start position:0%
on the floor you can call a clock
 
02:09:14.990 --> 02:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
you're not calling it caucus okay that
 
02:09:17.689 --> 02:09:17.699 align:start position:0%
was just a question Mel are we doing the
 
02:09:21.530 --> 02:09:21.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:24.950 --> 02:09:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:26.629 --> 02:09:26.639 align:start position:0%
looks like we're we're doing the same
 
02:09:26.639 --> 02:09:27.890 align:start position:0%
looks like we're we're doing the same
thing

02:09:27.890 --> 02:09:27.900 align:start position:0%
thing
 
02:09:39.350 --> 02:09:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:39.360 --> 02:10:12.350 align:start position:0%
 
uh

02:28:46.610 --> 02:28:46.620 align:start position:0%
quite quiet yeah what happened to that
 
02:28:53.330 --> 02:28:53.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:03.780 --> 02:29:03.790 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:03.790 --> 02:29:14.770 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:29:14.770 --> 02:29:14.780 align:start position:0%

02:29:47.210 --> 02:29:47.220 align:start position:0%
okay I hope so it is 11 30 I think we
 
02:29:49.190 --> 02:29:49.200 align:start position:0%
need net over here
 
02:29:53.929 --> 02:29:53.939 align:start position:0%
is everybody in place here and
 
02:29:53.939 --> 02:30:00.429 align:start position:0%
is everybody in place here and
um

02:30:00.429 --> 02:30:00.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:02.510 --> 02:30:02.520 align:start position:0%
here now
 
02:30:04.630 --> 02:30:04.640 align:start position:0%
okay for that
 
02:30:09.250 --> 02:30:09.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:15.170 --> 02:30:15.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:19.130 --> 02:30:19.140 align:start position:0%

okay can people hear us out there now
yep

02:30:30.550 --> 02:30:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:34.490 --> 02:30:34.500 align:start position:0%
okay we do have a motion on the table
 
02:30:38.389 --> 02:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
and I've made the decision and I am
 
02:30:40.490 --> 02:30:40.500 align:start position:0%
making the decision now that we're just
 
02:30:44.030 --> 02:30:44.040 align:start position:0%
going to go ahead and let the decision
 
02:30:45.770 --> 02:30:45.780 align:start position:0%
be made by the full committee through
 
02:30:47.750 --> 02:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
voting on the motion that we have on the
 
02:30:49.730 --> 02:30:49.740 align:start position:0%
table that gets loaded up that's where
 
02:30:51.830 --> 02:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
we are if it gets voted down that's all
 
02:30:54.349 --> 02:30:54.359 align:start position:0%
we are and then we can proceed
 
02:30:54.359 --> 02:30:55.670 align:start position:0%
we are and then we can proceed
accordingly

02:30:55.670 --> 02:30:55.680 align:start position:0%
accordingly
 
02:30:58.250 --> 02:30:58.260 align:start position:0%
so with that if there's any more
 
02:31:02.270 --> 02:31:02.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:04.130 --> 02:31:04.140 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
02:31:06.530 --> 02:31:06.540 align:start position:0%
I think we're on the amendment sorry
 
02:31:06.540 --> 02:31:12.770 align:start position:0%
I think we're on the amendment sorry
sorry

02:31:12.770 --> 02:31:12.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:12.780 --> 02:31:14.389 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

02:31:14.389 --> 02:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:31:17.150 --> 02:31:17.160 align:start position:0%
so we're on the amendment right now
 
02:31:19.150 --> 02:31:19.160 align:start position:0%
and this uh
 
02:31:22.910 --> 02:31:22.920 align:start position:0%
0752h further description yeah I think
 
02:31:25.070 --> 02:31:25.080 align:start position:0%
representative Mullen had a comment she
 
02:31:28.130 --> 02:31:28.140 align:start position:0%
wanted to make yes sir okay represent
 
02:31:31.610 --> 02:31:31.620 align:start position:0%
yes I see you thank you Mr chair I I
 
02:31:33.830 --> 02:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
just wanted to reference back to this
 
02:31:38.450 --> 02:31:38.460 align:start position:0%
concept that uh if we were in fact to
 
02:31:42.050 --> 02:31:42.060 align:start position:0%
adopt representative luno's uh Amendment
 
02:31:45.110 --> 02:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
either on its own or in a joint
 
02:31:47.090 --> 02:31:47.100 align:start position:0%
Amendment with representative moffatt
 
02:31:48.950 --> 02:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
that somehow or another it was going to
 
02:31:48.960 --> 02:31:49.610 align:start position:0%
that somehow or another it was going to
be

02:31:49.610 --> 02:31:49.620 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:31:52.910 --> 02:31:52.920 align:start position:0%
creating all of this cumbersome
 
02:31:56.929 --> 02:31:56.939 align:start position:0%
additional work uh and we have we
 
02:31:58.790 --> 02:31:58.800 align:start position:0%
continued our robust discussion you'll
 
02:32:02.210 --> 02:32:02.220 align:start position:0%
be surprised right into our caucus where
 
02:32:04.370 --> 02:32:04.380 align:start position:0%
um I I shared with members that the way
 
02:32:08.870 --> 02:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
that I read this the growth and effort
 
02:32:13.309 --> 02:32:13.319 align:start position:0%
aspect of this amendment is meant to
 
02:32:16.910 --> 02:32:16.920 align:start position:0%
measure the growth and effort aspects of
 
02:32:19.309 --> 02:32:19.319 align:start position:0%
gifted and talented students not the
 
02:32:21.250 --> 02:32:21.260 align:start position:0%
entire School body
 
02:32:21.260 --> 02:32:22.849 align:start position:0%
entire School body
so

02:32:22.849 --> 02:32:22.859 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:32:25.370 --> 02:32:25.380 align:start position:0%
um representative Sean I uh had some
 
02:32:28.130 --> 02:32:28.140 align:start position:0%
clarifying conversation about the idea
 
02:32:30.650 --> 02:32:30.660 align:start position:0%
that if you're in a school district like
 
02:32:32.809 --> 02:32:32.819 align:start position:0%
like bedford's that has a gifted and
 
02:32:36.230 --> 02:32:36.240 align:start position:0%
talented program and you're asked to
 
02:32:40.010 --> 02:32:40.020 align:start position:0%
report out on uh some specifics of what
 
02:32:42.830 --> 02:32:42.840 align:start position:0%
you do for growth and effort with your
 
02:32:45.469 --> 02:32:45.479 align:start position:0%
gifted and talented students that it's
 
02:32:47.330 --> 02:32:47.340 align:start position:0%
probably going to take about 15 minutes
 
02:32:51.590 --> 02:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
to write up a summary statement of goal
 
02:32:54.610 --> 02:32:54.620 align:start position:0%
setting of uh
 
02:32:58.190 --> 02:32:58.200 align:start position:0%
compacting curriculum of setting up
 
02:33:00.349 --> 02:33:00.359 align:start position:0%
independent study with students I I
 
02:33:03.290 --> 02:33:03.300 align:start position:0%
don't think that it is nearly as
 
02:33:06.469 --> 02:33:06.479 align:start position:0%
cumbersome as people fear that it might
 
02:33:10.370 --> 02:33:10.380 align:start position:0%
be because it only applies to 189 colon
 
02:33:12.889 --> 02:33:12.899 align:start position:0%
29 which is identification and
 
02:33:15.650 --> 02:33:15.660 align:start position:0%
accommodation of gifted students not the
 
02:33:19.610 --> 02:33:19.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:22.070 --> 02:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
are there further comments on on the
 
02:33:28.690 --> 02:33:28.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:30.770 --> 02:33:30.780 align:start position:0%
is it an order
 
02:33:33.770 --> 02:33:33.780 align:start position:0%
uh to have a motion come forward to
 
02:33:38.570 --> 02:33:38.580 align:start position:0%
recess this until Thursday to allow uh
 
02:33:40.070 --> 02:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
representative Moffat and representative
 
02:33:42.830 --> 02:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
luno together to see if they might be
 
02:33:45.469 --> 02:33:45.479 align:start position:0%
able to Cobble together a uh an
 
02:33:48.190 --> 02:33:48.200 align:start position:0%
amendment that would uh basically
 
02:33:50.450 --> 02:33:50.460 align:start position:0%
Encompass the conversations that we've
 
02:33:53.210 --> 02:33:53.220 align:start position:0%
had around this today is that an order a
 
02:33:55.969 --> 02:33:55.979 align:start position:0%
motion to recess until Thursday
 
02:34:00.710 --> 02:34:00.720 align:start position:0%
we have a motion on the table right now
 
02:34:02.990 --> 02:34:03.000 align:start position:0%
I could resist but I'm not going to do
 
02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:04.250 align:start position:0%
I could resist but I'm not going to do
that

02:34:04.250 --> 02:34:04.260 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:34:07.190 --> 02:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
um I I feel that there's we need to just
 
02:34:10.190 --> 02:34:10.200 align:start position:0%
vote on this amendment now if in fact
 
02:34:13.190 --> 02:34:13.200 align:start position:0%
the committee believes this is a topic
 
02:34:16.550 --> 02:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
it's evidently uh generated a lot of
 
02:34:19.250 --> 02:34:19.260 align:start position:0%
discussion here uh positive constructive
 
02:34:22.910 --> 02:34:22.920 align:start position:0%
discussion I'm I'm glad we're seeing us
 
02:34:26.090 --> 02:34:26.100 align:start position:0%
starting to address student growth and
 
02:34:28.910 --> 02:34:28.920 align:start position:0%
effort and and I'd like to see that uh
 
02:34:32.030 --> 02:34:32.040 align:start position:0%
done not just for gifted kids either I'd
 
02:34:34.130 --> 02:34:34.140 align:start position:0%
like to see it for all our kids and I
 
02:34:36.710 --> 02:34:36.720 align:start position:0%
think this is a area where commissioner
 
02:34:39.530 --> 02:34:39.540 align:start position:0%
edible is also stressed remember we used
 
02:34:42.849 --> 02:34:42.859 align:start position:0%
to measure the the outcomes
 
02:34:45.469 --> 02:34:45.479 align:start position:0%
of our adequate education and the
 
02:34:47.929 --> 02:34:47.939 align:start position:0%
delivery of an ad good education through
 
02:34:50.150 --> 02:34:50.160 align:start position:0%
strictly and the performance side on
 
02:34:52.010 --> 02:34:52.020 align:start position:0%
achievement only
 
02:34:54.469 --> 02:34:54.479 align:start position:0%
now we're looking at achievement and
 
02:34:57.790 --> 02:34:57.800 align:start position:0%
growth which is very important
 
02:34:59.929 --> 02:34:59.939 align:start position:0%
if there's growth going on that's
 
02:35:01.849 --> 02:35:01.859 align:start position:0%
exactly what we want to see as long as
 
02:35:03.710 --> 02:35:03.720 align:start position:0%
we don't keep dropping the bar down and
 
02:35:05.330 --> 02:35:05.340 align:start position:0%
that's our proficiency level is going
 
02:35:08.809 --> 02:35:08.819 align:start position:0%
down but we do want to see growth I
 
02:35:10.730 --> 02:35:10.740 align:start position:0%
think that this is a topic which
 
02:35:14.330 --> 02:35:14.340 align:start position:0%
deserves further discussion but in an
 
02:35:16.730 --> 02:35:16.740 align:start position:0%
activity and we could develop a
 
02:35:18.830 --> 02:35:18.840 align:start position:0%
subcommittee just to work at that a work
 
02:35:20.870 --> 02:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
group to work on this and work with the
 
02:35:20.880 --> 02:35:22.030 align:start position:0%
group to work on this and work with the
Department

02:35:22.030 --> 02:35:22.040 align:start position:0%
Department
 
02:35:27.770 --> 02:35:27.780 align:start position:0%
to to try to get to that end that
 
02:35:30.530 --> 02:35:30.540 align:start position:0%
outcome that reptile oil is looking for
 
02:35:33.650 --> 02:35:33.660 align:start position:0%
so uh if if this amendment gets voted
 
02:35:37.250 --> 02:35:37.260 align:start position:0%
down I I'm prepared to you know work
 
02:35:39.710 --> 02:35:39.720 align:start position:0%
towards the the desired end that
 
02:35:43.010 --> 02:35:43.020 align:start position:0%
represents Bruno and others I hear are
 
02:35:46.070 --> 02:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
interested in looking at I I also agree
 
02:35:48.530 --> 02:35:48.540 align:start position:0%
we need to be looking at growth
 
02:35:48.540 --> 02:35:49.130 align:start position:0%
we need to be looking at growth
um

02:35:49.130 --> 02:35:49.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:35:50.690 --> 02:35:50.700 align:start position:0%
and effort
 
02:35:53.690 --> 02:35:53.700 align:start position:0%
is is a motion to retain at this point
 
02:35:56.270 --> 02:35:56.280 align:start position:0%
in time in order not with another motion
 
02:35:58.250 --> 02:35:58.260 align:start position:0%
on the table we have a motion on the
 
02:36:01.670 --> 02:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
table right now on this particular a uh
 
02:36:04.550 --> 02:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
Amendment now the the emotion to retain
 
02:36:07.010 --> 02:36:07.020 align:start position:0%
does not take precedent
 
02:36:07.020 --> 02:36:08.690 align:start position:0%
does not take precedent
not

02:36:08.690 --> 02:36:08.700 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:36:11.750 --> 02:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
you can't have retention on a specific
 
02:36:11.760 --> 02:36:13.309 align:start position:0%
you can't have retention on a specific
Amendment

02:36:13.309 --> 02:36:13.319 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
02:36:16.309 --> 02:36:16.319 align:start position:0%
you can retain a bill but that Amendment
 
02:36:17.870 --> 02:36:17.880 align:start position:0%
right now
 
02:36:20.389 --> 02:36:20.399 align:start position:0%
um is
 
02:36:24.469 --> 02:36:24.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:27.050 --> 02:36:27.060 align:start position:0%
so the so the if I make this clarify
 
02:36:29.270 --> 02:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
here so once we dispose of this
 
02:36:30.889 --> 02:36:30.899 align:start position:0%
particular Amendment
 
02:36:32.990 --> 02:36:33.000 align:start position:0%
and we're then back to the main motion
 
02:36:36.889 --> 02:36:36.899 align:start position:0%
as OTP as amended at that point in time
 
02:36:40.610 --> 02:36:40.620 align:start position:0%
is it a is it appropriate to move to
 
02:36:40.620 --> 02:36:43.969 align:start position:0%
is it a is it appropriate to move to
retain

02:36:43.969 --> 02:36:43.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:46.490 --> 02:36:46.500 align:start position:0%
I I'd have to check and see if the
 
02:36:50.030 --> 02:36:50.040 align:start position:0%
motion to retain because you will have a
 
02:36:52.190 --> 02:36:52.200 align:start position:0%
motion on the table which will be ought
 
02:36:55.849 --> 02:36:55.859 align:start position:0%
to pass as amended right that will be on
 
02:36:58.429 --> 02:36:58.439 align:start position:0%
the table so there will be a motion put
 
02:37:01.370 --> 02:37:01.380 align:start position:0%
forward now if you vote down that
 
02:37:03.590 --> 02:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
ought to pass as amended then we can
 
02:37:06.710 --> 02:37:06.720 align:start position:0%
have a motion for retention
 
02:37:10.210 --> 02:37:10.220 align:start position:0%
go back two steps to get to that right
 
02:37:12.650 --> 02:37:12.660 align:start position:0%
we have to take a couple steps before we
 
02:37:13.910 --> 02:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
even get to that where I'm going to
 
02:37:15.889 --> 02:37:15.899 align:start position:0%
accept a motion before we can thank you
 
02:37:18.050 --> 02:37:18.060 align:start position:0%
thank you for that clarification you're
 
02:37:21.230 --> 02:37:21.240 align:start position:0%
welcome so with that uh we're going to
 
02:37:23.030 --> 02:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
move forward here and I'm going to ask
 
02:37:27.110 --> 02:37:27.120 align:start position:0%

02:38:36.190 --> 02:38:36.200 align:start position:0%
representative Allison yes
 
02:38:40.809 --> 02:38:40.819 align:start position:0%
yes you're that way yes
 
02:38:40.819 --> 02:38:47.590 align:start position:0%
yes you're that way yes
yes

02:38:47.590 --> 02:38:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:50.950 --> 02:38:50.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh representative
 
02:38:54.830 --> 02:38:54.840 align:start position:0%
I'd like to move multi-pays amended
 
02:38:57.230 --> 02:38:57.240 align:start position:0%
for HP 321
 
02:39:00.410 --> 02:39:00.420 align:start position:0%
yes for hb321
 
02:39:04.190 --> 02:39:04.200 align:start position:0%
is there a second representation yes
 
02:39:05.990 --> 02:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
so we have a motion on the table now
 
02:39:09.770 --> 02:39:09.780 align:start position:0%
octopass on 321 as amended
 
02:39:11.990 --> 02:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh made by representative Muppets second
 
02:39:14.809 --> 02:39:14.819 align:start position:0%
by representative Shaw represent Moffett
 
02:39:16.429 --> 02:39:16.439 align:start position:0%
do you have anything to further
 
02:39:17.809 --> 02:39:17.819 align:start position:0%
discussion I think we've talked for two
 
02:39:22.610 --> 02:39:22.620 align:start position:0%
hours on this and uh a vocal vote
 
02:39:26.290 --> 02:39:26.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:30.410 --> 02:39:30.420 align:start position:0%
no I just think that if we did have a
 
02:39:35.510 --> 02:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:38.270 --> 02:39:38.280 align:start position:0%
the two together knowing now that that
 
02:39:41.570 --> 02:39:41.580 align:start position:0%
is referring only to gifted and talented
 
02:39:44.389 --> 02:39:44.399 align:start position:0%
and not the whole entire school because
 
02:39:48.650 --> 02:39:48.660 align:start position:0%
I I didn't get a chance to really in uh
 
02:39:50.990 --> 02:39:51.000 align:start position:0%
indulge into the
 
02:39:54.950 --> 02:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
um into the amendment I I think I could
 
02:39:57.950 --> 02:39:57.960 align:start position:0%
have supported as an AV but
 
02:40:00.650 --> 02:40:00.660 align:start position:0%
um as a a Spanish
 
02:40:03.530 --> 02:40:03.540 align:start position:0%
um as a stand-alone I would go with the
 
02:40:06.830 --> 02:40:06.840 align:start position:0%
other cast as amended right now
 
02:40:08.650 --> 02:40:08.660 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:40:13.070 --> 02:40:13.080 align:start position:0%
yeah point of inquiry of the chair so um
 
02:40:15.830 --> 02:40:15.840 align:start position:0%
so I don't think this is a new motion by
 
02:40:17.690 --> 02:40:17.700 align:start position:0%
representative Moffett I think this is
 
02:40:21.250 --> 02:40:21.260 align:start position:0%
going back to the original motion of OTP
 
02:40:24.290 --> 02:40:24.300 align:start position:0%
you know with the with the amendment so
 
02:40:28.910 --> 02:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
we're winding unwinding the Motions so
 
02:40:32.210 --> 02:40:32.220 align:start position:0%
um so this is not a new motion and and
 
02:40:35.090 --> 02:40:35.100 align:start position:0%
would it be in order though if this
 
02:40:38.090 --> 02:40:38.100 align:start position:0%
motion were to fail that
 
02:40:43.969 --> 02:40:43.979 align:start position:0%
either a motion to retain or a um a
 
02:40:47.630 --> 02:40:47.640 align:start position:0%
request to recess would be in order so
 
02:40:50.870 --> 02:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
that um so that another amendment could
 
02:40:54.130 --> 02:40:54.140 align:start position:0%
um could be produced and uh and uh
 
02:40:56.510 --> 02:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
exactly along the lines as to what
 
02:40:58.910 --> 02:40:58.920 align:start position:0%
representative Shaw was saying
 
02:41:01.190 --> 02:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
um where where the um the Moffett
 
02:41:05.510 --> 02:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
Amendment would be 29b and the the luno
 
02:41:07.550 --> 02:41:07.560 align:start position:0%
um Ellison Woodcock Amendment would be
 
02:41:07.560 --> 02:41:09.530 align:start position:0%
um Ellison Woodcock Amendment would be
29c

02:41:09.530 --> 02:41:09.540 align:start position:0%
29c
 
02:41:12.170 --> 02:41:12.180 align:start position:0%
um no change of wording uh and that that
 
02:41:14.270 --> 02:41:14.280 align:start position:0%
could be brought up on the committee on
 
02:41:14.280 --> 02:41:15.950 align:start position:0%
could be brought up on the committee on
Thursday

02:41:15.950 --> 02:41:15.960 align:start position:0%
Thursday
 
02:41:21.650 --> 02:41:21.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:24.670 --> 02:41:24.680 align:start position:0%
it was a pi yeah okay that's right
 
02:41:28.210 --> 02:41:28.220 align:start position:0%

so taking it at the discussion we just
 
02:43:12.770 --> 02:43:12.780 align:start position:0%
we just had obviously there is uh
 
02:43:14.389 --> 02:43:14.399 align:start position:0%
information that we've just been going
 
02:43:17.450 --> 02:43:17.460 align:start position:0%
over that deserves further inquiry on
 
02:43:20.270 --> 02:43:20.280 align:start position:0%
the part of this committee so that this
 
02:43:24.110 --> 02:43:24.120 align:start position:0%
topic will be brought up at a
 
02:43:29.030 --> 02:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh by us and I will when we have a
 
02:43:30.290 --> 02:43:30.300 align:start position:0%
little bit more time we're trying to
 
02:43:31.969 --> 02:43:31.979 align:start position:0%
accept all these bills right now but
 
02:43:33.710 --> 02:43:33.720 align:start position:0%
upon getting this done
 
02:43:35.809 --> 02:43:35.819 align:start position:0%
uh we can have a committee as a whole
 
02:43:38.750 --> 02:43:38.760 align:start position:0%
and look at it and from that committee
 
02:43:41.030 --> 02:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
as a whole we can design an
 
02:43:43.370 --> 02:43:43.380 align:start position:0%
administrative letter signed by this
 
02:43:45.590 --> 02:43:45.600 align:start position:0%
committee as we did years ago when we
 
02:43:48.170 --> 02:43:48.180 align:start position:0%
sent one to commissioner Berry asking
 
02:43:52.370 --> 02:43:52.380 align:start position:0%
for information and uh to delve into the
 
02:43:55.429 --> 02:43:55.439 align:start position:0%
issue here of encouraging student growth
 
02:44:00.410 --> 02:44:00.420 align:start position:0%
and effort so we will pursue that once
 
02:44:02.809 --> 02:44:02.819 align:start position:0%
we get all these bills exact and also
 
02:44:04.969 --> 02:44:04.979 align:start position:0%
we're starting to get targeted with
 
02:44:07.610 --> 02:44:07.620 align:start position:0%
Senate bills as well so but it's on the
 
02:44:10.490 --> 02:44:10.500 align:start position:0%
docket and we won't forget it
 
02:44:12.889 --> 02:44:12.899 align:start position:0%
okay representative Luna will file a
 
02:44:14.809 --> 02:44:14.819 align:start position:0%
Minority Report
 
02:44:16.790 --> 02:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:44:19.750 --> 02:44:19.760 align:start position:0%

so we're going to try to get one more
 
02:44:31.510 --> 02:44:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:35.030 --> 02:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
and with that I I'd love to represent
 
02:44:38.630 --> 02:44:38.640 align:start position:0%
phone for a motion please I like to make
 
02:44:42.710 --> 02:44:42.720 align:start position:0%
a motion off the pass and and that and
 
02:44:52.370 --> 02:44:52.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:54.830 --> 02:44:54.840 align:start position:0%
okay and it was second by represent
 
02:44:59.630 --> 02:44:59.640 align:start position:0%
Allard uh made by reps and boom on HB 71
 
02:45:01.870 --> 02:45:01.880 align:start position:0%
that's a bill that deals with emergency
 
02:45:04.030 --> 02:45:04.040 align:start position:0%
uh meetings
 
02:45:07.550 --> 02:45:07.560 align:start position:0%
and he's also indicated that he has an
 
02:45:11.030 --> 02:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
amendment that uh please I'd like to go
 
02:45:13.969 --> 02:45:13.979 align:start position:0%
ahead and discuss as well so uh
 
02:45:15.410 --> 02:45:15.420 align:start position:0%
represent phone
 
02:45:18.710 --> 02:45:18.720 align:start position:0%
but thank you uh Mr chair on the
 
02:45:21.230 --> 02:45:21.240 align:start position:0%
amendment on the discussion we had at
 
02:45:23.450 --> 02:45:23.460 align:start position:0%
the original hearing there was a lot of
 
02:45:25.309 --> 02:45:25.319 align:start position:0%
concern about
 
02:45:28.309 --> 02:45:28.319 align:start position:0%
other things that can happen you know
 
02:45:29.990 --> 02:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
which could have been covered by
 
02:45:32.090 --> 02:45:32.100 align:start position:0%
Insurance anyway but the amendment just
 
02:45:34.490 --> 02:45:34.500 align:start position:0%
specifies the court shall not allow
 
02:45:35.990 --> 02:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
special meeting if the emergency
 
02:45:38.330 --> 02:45:38.340 align:start position:0%
involves a collective bargaining women
 
02:45:41.450 --> 02:45:41.460 align:start position:0%
so all the other stuff was taken out so
 
02:45:43.910 --> 02:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
it just caused by collective bargaining
 
02:45:46.490 --> 02:45:46.500 align:start position:0%
agreement and to that you know it's
 
02:45:49.969 --> 02:45:49.979 align:start position:0%
still no means no if the school district
 
02:45:54.110 --> 02:45:54.120 align:start position:0%
at their meeting whether that the
 
02:45:56.630 --> 02:45:56.640 align:start position:0%
regular the school district meeting and
 
02:45:58.550 --> 02:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
the people vote no on collective
 
02:46:00.469 --> 02:46:00.479 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreement
 
02:46:02.870 --> 02:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
the court cannot give a special
 
02:46:06.410 --> 02:46:06.420 align:start position:0%
emergency meeting for that it has to go
 
02:46:08.870 --> 02:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
to the following year so everything else
 
02:46:11.450 --> 02:46:11.460 align:start position:0%
is taken out so anyway that's with the
 
02:46:13.309 --> 02:46:13.319 align:start position:0%
amendment do you have do you have the
 
02:46:16.090 --> 02:46:16.100 align:start position:0%
number of your Amendment represents on
 
02:46:20.469 --> 02:46:20.479 align:start position:0%
0498h do we did we get you in there yes
 
02:46:25.370 --> 02:46:25.380 align:start position:0%
I don't have it I don't have a copy of
 
02:46:28.870 --> 02:46:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:31.610 --> 02:46:31.620 align:start position:0%
thank you and everybody who had a copy
 
02:46:32.570 --> 02:46:32.580 align:start position:0%
of it
 
02:46:37.190 --> 02:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
it's a long time ago I knew on March 3rd
 
02:46:41.389 --> 02:46:41.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:45.050 --> 02:46:45.060 align:start position:0%
yes Mr chair just a question of the
 
02:46:49.130 --> 02:46:49.140 align:start position:0%
sponsor yes yes go ahead so so um so
 
02:46:50.870 --> 02:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
thanks representative boam for bringing
 
02:46:53.750 --> 02:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
this forward would would this prevent a
 
02:46:56.630 --> 02:46:56.640 align:start position:0%
school district from having a subsequent
 
02:46:59.510 --> 02:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
question on the warrant that that says
 
02:47:01.309 --> 02:47:01.319 align:start position:0%
something along like like we've seen
 
02:47:02.750 --> 02:47:02.760 align:start position:0%
before that says something along the
 
02:47:05.690 --> 02:47:05.700 align:start position:0%
lines of if the um collective bargaining
 
02:47:08.809 --> 02:47:08.819 align:start position:0%
agreement in the prior question fails uh
 
02:47:10.550 --> 02:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
does this body authorize a special
 
02:47:13.969 --> 02:47:13.979 align:start position:0%
meeting to be held to consider no that's
 
02:47:16.190 --> 02:47:16.200 align:start position:0%
what could happen I mean they can put
 
02:47:18.290 --> 02:47:18.300 align:start position:0%
that actually in the warrant saying if
 
02:47:19.910 --> 02:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
this warrant fails we can have a special
 
02:47:22.250 --> 02:47:22.260 align:start position:0%
meeting right so so so this amendment
 
02:47:24.170 --> 02:47:24.180 align:start position:0%
would not bar that from happening well
 
02:47:27.290 --> 02:47:27.300 align:start position:0%
just pause the judge for somebody
 
02:47:29.570 --> 02:47:29.580 align:start position:0%
requesting an emergency special meeting
 
02:47:29.580 --> 02:47:31.510 align:start position:0%
requesting an emergency special meeting
gotcha

02:47:31.510 --> 02:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
gotcha
 
02:47:34.130 --> 02:47:34.140 align:start position:0%
doing a special needs it can be done
 
02:47:36.230 --> 02:47:36.240 align:start position:0%
beforehand like you had said
 
02:47:38.210 --> 02:47:38.220 align:start position:0%
in other words if it's in the warrant
 
02:47:40.670 --> 02:47:40.680 align:start position:0%
saying a special meeting could be right
 
02:47:44.150 --> 02:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:47.150 --> 02:47:47.160 align:start position:0%
just just pause a court hearing for a
 
02:47:51.650 --> 02:47:51.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:54.349 --> 02:47:54.359 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm looking for your amenity or you
 
02:48:00.830 --> 02:48:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:03.530 --> 02:48:03.540 align:start position:0%
well it was made on February 24th and
 
02:48:05.990 --> 02:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
was sent that month to third we just got
 
02:48:08.690 --> 02:48:08.700 align:start position:0%
it Again Jennifer Ford just sent it out
 
02:48:11.090 --> 02:48:11.100 align:start position:0%
to everybody okay hey thank you Jennifer
 
02:48:12.610 --> 02:48:12.620 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:48:15.290 --> 02:48:15.300 align:start position:0%
do you guys need hard copies
 
02:48:18.710 --> 02:48:18.720 align:start position:0%
no no I'm just trying to get here I see
 
02:48:22.910 --> 02:48:22.920 align:start position:0%
it on top of that I distributed also
 
02:48:25.550 --> 02:48:25.560 align:start position:0%
Julie I don't have it
 
02:48:27.490 --> 02:48:27.500 align:start position:0%
just came in
 
02:48:31.190 --> 02:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
because everybody had a that it's it
 
02:48:35.870 --> 02:48:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:37.670 --> 02:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
the court shall not allow a special
 
02:48:39.830 --> 02:48:39.840 align:start position:0%
meeting if the emergency involves a
 
02:48:41.510 --> 02:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining agreement that was
 
02:48:43.150 --> 02:48:43.160 align:start position:0%
voted down at the regular meeting
 
02:48:45.170 --> 02:48:45.180 align:start position:0%
including a collective bargaining
 
02:48:46.969 --> 02:48:46.979 align:start position:0%
agreement modified after the regular
 
02:48:46.979 --> 02:48:50.389 align:start position:0%
agreement modified after the regular
meeting

02:48:50.389 --> 02:48:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:50.399 --> 02:48:53.330 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:48:53.330 --> 02:48:53.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:55.849 --> 02:48:55.859 align:start position:0%
so this is open for discussion at this
 
02:48:58.250 --> 02:48:58.260 align:start position:0%
point in time
 
02:49:00.410 --> 02:49:00.420 align:start position:0%
reps at home if there's anybody who has
 
02:49:03.050 --> 02:49:03.060 align:start position:0%
a you can answer some of those questions
 
02:49:03.060 --> 02:49:10.030 align:start position:0%
a you can answer some of those questions
yeah

02:49:10.030 --> 02:49:10.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:12.190 --> 02:49:12.200 align:start position:0%
appreciate the chance
 
02:49:14.990 --> 02:49:15.000 align:start position:0%
either to you or to representative uh
 
02:49:16.490 --> 02:49:16.500 align:start position:0%
boam it doesn't matter because I just
 
02:49:18.650 --> 02:49:18.660 align:start position:0%
want to make sure I'm clear on the line
 
02:49:20.450 --> 02:49:20.460 align:start position:0%
six is I just printed the amendment
 
02:49:22.429 --> 02:49:22.439 align:start position:0%
thank you John by the way on the lines
 
02:49:24.889 --> 02:49:24.899 align:start position:0%
six and seven of the amendment where it
 
02:49:26.450 --> 02:49:26.460 align:start position:0%
says including a collective buying
 
02:49:28.849 --> 02:49:28.859 align:start position:0%
agreement modified after the regular
 
02:49:28.859 --> 02:49:29.750 align:start position:0%
agreement modified after the regular
meeting

02:49:29.750 --> 02:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
02:49:32.210 --> 02:49:32.220 align:start position:0%
so is the intent here representative
 
02:49:34.790 --> 02:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
that if the committee if the
 
02:49:36.889 --> 02:49:36.899 align:start position:0%
negotiations get together and they agree
 
02:49:38.990 --> 02:49:39.000 align:start position:0%
following that nothing can happen they
 
02:49:41.150 --> 02:49:41.160 align:start position:0%
can't go they can't move it forward
 
02:49:43.790 --> 02:49:43.800 align:start position:0%
it will move forward that the next
 
02:49:43.800 --> 02:49:44.929 align:start position:0%
it will move forward that the next
meeting

02:49:44.929 --> 02:49:44.939 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
02:49:47.270 --> 02:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
not the quartet rule of the special
 
02:49:49.790 --> 02:49:49.800 align:start position:0%
meeting I mean that's the same thing if
 
02:49:49.800 --> 02:49:50.750 align:start position:0%
meeting I mean that's the same thing if
they

02:49:50.750 --> 02:49:50.760 align:start position:0%
they
 
02:49:53.510 --> 02:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
put in the warrant initially saying and
 
02:49:55.070 --> 02:49:55.080 align:start position:0%
we can have a special meeting after them
 
02:49:56.450 --> 02:49:56.460 align:start position:0%
that's no problem they will do
 
02:49:58.670 --> 02:49:58.680 align:start position:0%
modifications that will do it but just
 
02:50:02.270 --> 02:50:02.280 align:start position:0%
at a court hearing a judge can't rule oh
 
02:50:04.690 --> 02:50:04.700 align:start position:0%
yeah we can have a special meeting now
 
02:50:07.130 --> 02:50:07.140 align:start position:0%
even though you made the modifications
 
02:50:10.309 --> 02:50:10.319 align:start position:0%
which if you remember my testimony would
 
02:50:13.130 --> 02:50:13.140 align:start position:0%
and others that the problem was the
 
02:50:14.990 --> 02:50:15.000 align:start position:0%
special meeting might not even happen
 
02:50:17.750 --> 02:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
until September October which delays the
 
02:50:19.370 --> 02:50:19.380 align:start position:0%
tax bill and people don't get the tax
 
02:50:21.590 --> 02:50:21.600 align:start position:0%
billed right before Christmas instead of
 
02:50:23.929 --> 02:50:23.939 align:start position:0%
the end so that's the main issue on this
 
02:50:27.190 --> 02:50:27.200 align:start position:0%
for a special meeting thank you
 
02:50:30.050 --> 02:50:30.060 align:start position:0%
a question
 
02:50:32.210 --> 02:50:32.220 align:start position:0%
yes I do
 
02:50:35.570 --> 02:50:35.580 align:start position:0%
um so uh when a court hears a petition
 
02:50:39.590 --> 02:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
for an emergency uh meeting they right
 
02:50:42.050 --> 02:50:42.060 align:start position:0%
now in statute they're given uh five
 
02:50:45.050 --> 02:50:45.060 align:start position:0%
guidelines to follow
 
02:50:45.060 --> 02:50:45.710 align:start position:0%
guidelines to follow
um

02:50:45.710 --> 02:50:45.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:50:48.170 --> 02:50:48.180 align:start position:0%
the severity of the harm to be avoided
 
02:50:51.590 --> 02:50:51.600 align:start position:0%
the urgency of the petitioner's need
 
02:50:54.349 --> 02:50:54.359 align:start position:0%
whether the claim claimed emergency was
 
02:50:57.110 --> 02:50:57.120 align:start position:0%
foreseeable or avoidable whether the
 
02:50:58.790 --> 02:50:58.800 align:start position:0%
appropriation could have been made at
 
02:51:00.110 --> 02:51:00.120 align:start position:0%
the annual meeting
 
02:51:01.910 --> 02:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
and whether there are alternative
 
02:51:04.130 --> 02:51:04.140 align:start position:0%
remedies not requiring an appropriate
 
02:51:04.140 --> 02:51:05.809 align:start position:0%
remedies not requiring an appropriate
appropriation

02:51:05.809 --> 02:51:05.819 align:start position:0%
appropriation
 
02:51:09.830 --> 02:51:09.840 align:start position:0%
you wanna I I am wondering if you want
 
02:51:13.490 --> 02:51:13.500 align:start position:0%
to add a sixth uh guideline there for
 
02:51:16.130 --> 02:51:16.140 align:start position:0%
the court that if it's a collective
 
02:51:18.770 --> 02:51:18.780 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreement uh it's got to be
 
02:51:18.780 --> 02:51:20.030 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreement uh it's got to be
refused

02:51:20.030 --> 02:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
refused
 
02:51:22.070 --> 02:51:22.080 align:start position:0%
that you're taking the
 
02:51:22.080 --> 02:51:23.030 align:start position:0%
that you're taking the
um

02:51:23.030 --> 02:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:51:25.730 --> 02:51:25.740 align:start position:0%
you're taking the hand away from the
 
02:51:27.650 --> 02:51:27.660 align:start position:0%
judge and saying if it's collective
 
02:51:29.510 --> 02:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
bargaining that's it it can't it can't
 
02:51:31.730 --> 02:51:31.740 align:start position:0%
even be going to an emergency meeting
 
02:51:34.429 --> 02:51:34.439 align:start position:0%
regarding it meets these other five
 
02:51:37.250 --> 02:51:37.260 align:start position:0%
criteria the part of that law said the
 
02:51:41.389 --> 02:51:41.399 align:start position:0%
judge will consider the following and
 
02:51:45.230 --> 02:51:45.240 align:start position:0%
um and whether or not it was done if if
 
02:51:48.530 --> 02:51:48.540 align:start position:0%
for example if it was on a warrant you
 
02:51:51.469 --> 02:51:51.479 align:start position:0%
shall consider if not if it's it's a
 
02:51:55.190 --> 02:51:55.200 align:start position:0%
real emergency that wasn't voted on
 
02:51:58.730 --> 02:51:58.740 align:start position:0%
at the district meeting there's no
 
02:52:01.730 --> 02:52:01.740 align:start position:0%
problem if it was voted on
 
02:52:04.309 --> 02:52:04.319 align:start position:0%
at the at the regular school district
 
02:52:06.349 --> 02:52:06.359 align:start position:0%
meeting collect the bargaining agreement
 
02:52:09.170 --> 02:52:09.180 align:start position:0%
was voted on then he can't
 
02:52:13.550 --> 02:52:13.560 align:start position:0%
because it was voted so a follow-up uh
 
02:52:16.670 --> 02:52:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:21.469 --> 02:52:21.479 align:start position:0%
so so they um what you're saying is I
 
02:52:24.710 --> 02:52:24.720 align:start position:0%
and I I'm trying to sort it out you're
 
02:52:26.150 --> 02:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
saying that
 
02:52:29.510 --> 02:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
the court that that you can the court
 
02:52:32.030 --> 02:52:32.040 align:start position:0%
can't even consider it they they can't
 
02:52:34.550 --> 02:52:34.560 align:start position:0%
even follow they're not guidelines or
 
02:52:37.070 --> 02:52:37.080 align:start position:0%
anything this is a blanket statement
 
02:52:39.230 --> 02:52:39.240 align:start position:0%
Court you can't even consider this
 
02:52:40.730 --> 02:52:40.740 align:start position:0%
appeal if it involves collective
 
02:52:43.490 --> 02:52:43.500 align:start position:0%
bargaining is that right right because
 
02:52:46.550 --> 02:52:46.560 align:start position:0%
it was already voted on by the people
 
02:52:49.010 --> 02:52:49.020 align:start position:0%
well the other ones are voted on the
 
02:52:52.969 --> 02:52:52.979 align:start position:0%
appeals for this emergency is also for
 
02:52:55.730 --> 02:52:55.740 align:start position:0%
other warn articles so if if somebody
 
02:52:58.370 --> 02:52:58.380 align:start position:0%
had a Warren article for
 
02:53:00.790 --> 02:53:00.800 align:start position:0%
um a school repair and it was voted down
 
02:53:04.370 --> 02:53:04.380 align:start position:0%
uh they wanted to repair their boiler uh
 
02:53:06.769 --> 02:53:06.779 align:start position:0%
but it wasn't wasn't at critical mass
 
02:53:08.690 --> 02:53:08.700 align:start position:0%
and then halfway through the school year
 
02:53:10.630 --> 02:53:10.640 align:start position:0%
the boiler blew up
 
02:53:10.640 --> 02:53:12.250 align:start position:0%
the boiler blew up
uh

02:53:12.250 --> 02:53:12.260 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:53:15.050 --> 02:53:15.060 align:start position:0%
they they couldn't because it had been
 
02:53:17.750 --> 02:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
voted down as a warrant article they
 
02:53:19.670 --> 02:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
couldn't appeal it to the court to have
 
02:53:21.769 --> 02:53:21.779 align:start position:0%
an emergency hearing and what I
 
02:53:24.290 --> 02:53:24.300 align:start position:0%
understand is this amendment says yes
 
02:53:25.490 --> 02:53:25.500 align:start position:0%
they can
 
02:53:27.830 --> 02:53:27.840 align:start position:0%
they can do any of those except
 
02:53:30.050 --> 02:53:30.060 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining is that correct
 
02:53:32.150 --> 02:53:32.160 align:start position:0%
right because collective bargaining
 
02:53:34.130 --> 02:53:34.140 align:start position:0%
isn't really an emergency the people
 
02:53:37.790 --> 02:53:37.800 align:start position:0%
said no and that and no means no in the
 
02:53:39.830 --> 02:53:39.840 align:start position:0%
case of a boiler like you mentioned in
 
02:53:41.809 --> 02:53:41.819 align:start position:0%
another case that was brought up the
 
02:53:43.429 --> 02:53:43.439 align:start position:0%
schools should have insurance on that
 
02:53:46.070 --> 02:53:46.080 align:start position:0%
anyway but yes the judge can consider
 
02:53:49.130 --> 02:53:49.140 align:start position:0%
this was happened in 1998 as we put in
 
02:53:51.050 --> 02:53:51.060 align:start position:0%
because there was a lot of special
 
02:53:54.050 --> 02:53:54.060 align:start position:0%
meetings and this bill law was made then
 
02:53:57.050 --> 02:53:57.060 align:start position:0%
because it sort of limit that limited
 
02:53:59.210 --> 02:53:59.220 align:start position:0%
the judge but I can't see and other
 
02:54:01.670 --> 02:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
people can't see is why just because
 
02:54:03.889 --> 02:54:03.899 align:start position:0%
people said no the reflective bargaining
 
02:54:06.110 --> 02:54:06.120 align:start position:0%
agreement that could result in an
 
02:54:09.050 --> 02:54:09.060 align:start position:0%
emergency it is not an emergency and in
 
02:54:11.570 --> 02:54:11.580 align:start position:0%
most cases like I've lived in Litchfield
 
02:54:14.269 --> 02:54:14.279 align:start position:0%
one 44 and a half years we've had a lot
 
02:54:17.450 --> 02:54:17.460 align:start position:0%
of contracts go down and the following
 
02:54:20.030 --> 02:54:20.040 align:start position:0%
year the modifications were made and
 
02:54:22.849 --> 02:54:22.859 align:start position:0%
voted on again and in most cases I don't
 
02:54:25.010 --> 02:54:25.020 align:start position:0%
know any that didn't all the cases
 
02:54:27.309 --> 02:54:27.319 align:start position:0%
resolved have been retroactive pay
 
02:54:30.349 --> 02:54:30.359 align:start position:0%
increases for the previous year so
 
02:54:32.929 --> 02:54:32.939 align:start position:0%
nobody lost anything except the year
 
02:54:35.750 --> 02:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
getting that pay raise but the point was
 
02:54:39.650 --> 02:54:39.660 align:start position:0%
it the changes needed to be made the
 
02:54:41.450 --> 02:54:41.460 align:start position:0%
public said no we need to make these
 
02:54:43.550 --> 02:54:43.560 align:start position:0%
changes and this happened what happened
 
02:54:45.769 --> 02:54:45.779 align:start position:0%
in Litchfield the changes were a result
 
02:54:48.530 --> 02:54:48.540 align:start position:0%
of the people did not like the health
 
02:54:51.170 --> 02:54:51.180 align:start position:0%
insurance part of it so
 
02:54:54.469 --> 02:54:54.479 align:start position:0%
yes this takes takes
 
02:54:56.809 --> 02:54:56.819 align:start position:0%
takes what we thought was in law to
 
02:54:58.790 --> 02:54:58.800 align:start position:0%
start with that they couldn't have one
 
02:55:01.130 --> 02:55:01.140 align:start position:0%
because like somebody imagined was only
 
02:55:02.750 --> 02:55:02.760 align:start position:0%
two in the last six years or something
 
02:55:05.510 --> 02:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
like that but yeah I mean in some cases
 
02:55:08.210 --> 02:55:08.220 align:start position:0%
we know you farm for judges and one
 
02:55:10.610 --> 02:55:10.620 align:start position:0%
that'll give you what you want so in
 
02:55:13.250 --> 02:55:13.260 align:start position:0%
this case it just takes the hand out of
 
02:55:14.990 --> 02:55:15.000 align:start position:0%
Judges which we've done in the past
 
02:55:18.170 --> 02:55:18.180 align:start position:0%
where a lot of other laws so no you
 
02:55:19.969 --> 02:55:19.979 align:start position:0%
can't do it go through a collective
 
02:55:24.950 --> 02:55:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:28.730 --> 02:55:28.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:30.230 --> 02:55:30.240 align:start position:0%
for me
 
02:55:34.690 --> 02:55:34.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:37.870 --> 02:55:37.880 align:start position:0%
oh there it is
 
02:55:40.969 --> 02:55:40.979 align:start position:0%
yeah I I would
 
02:55:45.290 --> 02:55:45.300 align:start position:0%
yes am I am I recognized yes okay thank
 
02:55:47.510 --> 02:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair yeah I'm going to vote I'm
 
02:55:48.889 --> 02:55:48.899 align:start position:0%
going to vote against this because it
 
02:55:51.710 --> 02:55:51.720 align:start position:0%
basically takes a discretion away from
 
02:55:54.530 --> 02:55:54.540 align:start position:0%
the uh from a local school board that
 
02:55:56.030 --> 02:55:56.040 align:start position:0%
wants to move on a particular item that
 
02:55:58.910 --> 02:55:58.920 align:start position:0%
they think is important and to tie their
 
02:56:01.370 --> 02:56:01.380 align:start position:0%
hands on this I think is is not uh
 
02:56:03.950 --> 02:56:03.960 align:start position:0%
relevant notwithstanding uh
 
02:56:05.330 --> 02:56:05.340 align:start position:0%
representative Baum's comment about
 
02:56:07.969 --> 02:56:07.979 align:start position:0%
retroactivity Etc it's just another
 
02:56:10.910 --> 02:56:10.920 align:start position:0%
example of trying to take the discretion
 
02:56:14.150 --> 02:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
of the local school board away from uh
 
02:56:15.950 --> 02:56:15.960 align:start position:0%
just their decision making on how they
 
02:56:21.730 --> 02:56:21.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:25.870 --> 02:56:25.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:28.309 --> 02:56:28.319 align:start position:0%
one question
 
02:56:31.130 --> 02:56:31.140 align:start position:0%
um if you have an emergency meeting
 
02:56:33.290 --> 02:56:33.300 align:start position:0%
I know we had an emergency meeting in
 
02:56:34.790 --> 02:56:34.800 align:start position:0%
Woodsville when we're looking at
 
02:56:37.910 --> 02:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
approving monies for the new school
 
02:56:40.969 --> 02:56:40.979 align:start position:0%
building project which we did but in
 
02:56:43.429 --> 02:56:43.439 align:start position:0%
order to have that measured passed we
 
02:56:47.030 --> 02:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
had about a two-thirds a majority not
 
02:56:50.590 --> 02:56:50.600 align:start position:0%
just a simple uh majority
 
02:56:53.150 --> 02:56:53.160 align:start position:0%
what's the case of emergency meeting
 
02:56:55.849 --> 02:56:55.859 align:start position:0%
such as this is that it had to be passed
 
02:56:59.269 --> 02:56:59.279 align:start position:0%
by a just a simple majority or or is
 
02:57:01.670 --> 02:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
there a two-thirds ruling or any sixty
 
02:57:01.680 --> 02:57:02.389 align:start position:0%
there a two-thirds ruling or any sixty
percent

02:57:02.389 --> 02:57:02.399 align:start position:0%
percent
 
02:57:05.030 --> 02:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
I I'm not unfamiliar so I just know
 
02:57:05.040 --> 02:57:07.670 align:start position:0%
I I'm not unfamiliar so I just know
questions

02:57:07.670 --> 02:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:57:09.830 --> 02:57:09.840 align:start position:0%
anybody have an answer I don't have an
 
02:57:12.170 --> 02:57:12.180 align:start position:0%
answer to that
 
02:57:15.230 --> 02:57:15.240 align:start position:0%
no that the bond issue two-thirds there
 
02:57:17.570 --> 02:57:17.580 align:start position:0%
was 60 percent of the mind has passed
 
02:57:20.349 --> 02:57:20.359 align:start position:0%
for a bondage
 
02:57:23.389 --> 02:57:23.399 align:start position:0%
when you're talking about appropriating
 
02:57:25.670 --> 02:57:25.680 align:start position:0%
additional dollars
 
02:57:28.790 --> 02:57:28.800 align:start position:0%
but this this could means if
 
02:57:31.190 --> 02:57:31.200 align:start position:0%
some issue has been raised for other
 
02:57:34.070 --> 02:57:34.080 align:start position:0%
things I like good stuff
 
02:57:37.429 --> 02:57:37.439 align:start position:0%
something happened uh under school and
 
02:57:39.469 --> 02:57:39.479 align:start position:0%
it didn't foresee it
 
02:57:41.570 --> 02:57:41.580 align:start position:0%
okay then you can have a special meeting
 
02:57:44.929 --> 02:57:44.939 align:start position:0%
for something that wasn't foreseen in
 
02:57:47.929 --> 02:57:47.939 align:start position:0%
this case it was it was foreseen we
 
02:57:49.309 --> 02:57:49.319 align:start position:0%
needed to deflect the body the
 
02:57:52.010 --> 02:57:52.020 align:start position:0%
negotiations were done but the people
 
02:57:55.730 --> 02:57:55.740 align:start position:0%
said no yes the school board should be
 
02:57:59.090 --> 02:57:59.100 align:start position:0%
prevented by the people the people vote
 
02:58:00.410 --> 02:58:00.420 align:start position:0%
for the school board the school board
 
02:58:02.090 --> 02:58:02.100 align:start position:0%
should be
 
02:58:04.730 --> 02:58:04.740 align:start position:0%
uh going with the people that voted for
 
02:58:06.830 --> 02:58:06.840 align:start position:0%
him because the problem is with
 
02:58:09.170 --> 02:58:09.180 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining agreements with
 
02:58:11.030 --> 02:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
both sides the school board because I've
 
02:58:13.790 --> 02:58:13.800 align:start position:0%
been on a few of them school board and
 
02:58:16.429 --> 02:58:16.439 align:start position:0%
the teachers negotiating agree on
 
02:58:18.769 --> 02:58:18.779 align:start position:0%
something then they both have to still
 
02:58:22.429 --> 02:58:22.439 align:start position:0%
say they agree on it so at that point
 
02:58:26.090 --> 02:58:26.100 align:start position:0%
yes that they if one side wants it the
 
02:58:28.550 --> 02:58:28.560 align:start position:0%
other side so the
 
02:58:30.530 --> 02:58:30.540 align:start position:0%
yeah even though they may not want to
 
02:58:32.990 --> 02:58:33.000 align:start position:0%
but the point is yeah this ties their
 
02:58:36.889 --> 02:58:36.899 align:start position:0%
hand because the people said no
 
02:58:40.130 --> 02:58:40.140 align:start position:0%
unforeseen emergencies and they'll
 
02:58:41.690 --> 02:58:41.700 align:start position:0%
Collective bargain agreement is not
 
02:58:45.950 --> 02:58:45.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:48.710 --> 02:58:48.720 align:start position:0%
any further discussion
 
02:58:52.790 --> 02:58:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:56.769 --> 02:58:56.779 align:start position:0%
not seeing any math work
 
02:58:59.450 --> 02:58:59.460 align:start position:0%
what's the motion what's our emotion put

um
 
03:49:49.370 --> 03:49:49.380 align:start position:0%
well I agree that schools
 
03:49:55.309 --> 03:49:55.319 align:start position:0%
um I need to look at and help women who
 
03:49:58.370 --> 03:49:58.380 align:start position:0%
do not and cannot afford
 
03:50:00.950 --> 03:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
um Master hygiene products
 
03:50:03.830 --> 03:50:03.840 align:start position:0%
the bill that was passed last year and
 
03:50:07.190 --> 03:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
passed into law was a late 28th a
 
03:50:07.200 --> 03:50:09.550 align:start position:0%
passed into law was a late 28th a
violation

03:50:09.550 --> 03:50:09.560 align:start position:0%
violation
 
03:50:12.910 --> 03:50:12.920 align:start position:0%
and I believe it needs to be
 
03:50:16.370 --> 03:50:16.380 align:start position:0%
taken out and leave it up to the school
 
03:50:18.650 --> 03:50:18.660 align:start position:0%
districts people say well school
 
03:50:21.590 --> 03:50:21.600 align:start position:0%
districts provide toilet paper well
 
03:50:23.809 --> 03:50:23.819 align:start position:0%
there's no mandate the school districts
 
03:50:26.269 --> 03:50:26.279 align:start position:0%
provide toilet paper they choose to
 
03:50:28.910 --> 03:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
provide toilet paper and they can choose
 
03:50:31.849 --> 03:50:31.859 align:start position:0%
to provide menstrual hygiene products as
 
03:50:31.859 --> 03:50:32.690 align:start position:0%
to provide menstrual hygiene products as
well

03:50:32.690 --> 03:50:32.700 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:50:35.570 --> 03:50:35.580 align:start position:0%
but for us to mandate either one of
 
03:50:38.750 --> 03:50:38.760 align:start position:0%
those would be it is a 28-a violation
 
03:50:42.050 --> 03:50:42.060 align:start position:0%
and we have no business mandating that
 
03:50:44.150 --> 03:50:44.160 align:start position:0%
cool thank you thank you very much reps
 
03:50:51.110 --> 03:50:51.120 align:start position:0%

particular bill this is the most
 
03:51:02.750 --> 03:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
punitive legislation that I've seen come
 
03:51:04.429 --> 03:51:04.439 align:start position:0%
before the committee in the last two and
 
03:51:05.809 --> 03:51:05.819 align:start position:0%
a half years that I've been involved
 
03:51:07.929 --> 03:51:07.939 align:start position:0%
with this uh
 
03:51:11.630 --> 03:51:11.640 align:start position:0%
we have if in fact the bill is approved
 
03:51:13.370 --> 03:51:13.380 align:start position:0%
and we go back to where we were three
 
03:51:15.889 --> 03:51:15.899 align:start position:0%
years ago we will have some school
 
03:51:18.769 --> 03:51:18.779 align:start position:0%
districts that will be able to provide
 
03:51:20.990 --> 03:51:21.000 align:start position:0%
these products and we'll have some who
 
03:51:23.570 --> 03:51:23.580 align:start position:0%
cannot or will not we will be in a
 
03:51:25.309 --> 03:51:25.319 align:start position:0%
position at that point
 
03:51:27.530 --> 03:51:27.540 align:start position:0%
and of
 
03:51:30.410 --> 03:51:30.420 align:start position:0%
young women going to the school nurse in
 
03:51:32.330 --> 03:51:32.340 align:start position:0%
the first year of this new bill and
 
03:51:32.340 --> 03:51:33.710 align:start position:0%
the first year of this new bill and
saying

03:51:33.710 --> 03:51:33.720 align:start position:0%
saying
 
03:51:35.929 --> 03:51:35.939 align:start position:0%
what happened to the machines that were
 
03:51:38.870 --> 03:51:38.880 align:start position:0%
in the in the ladies room or wherever
 
03:51:41.269 --> 03:51:41.279 align:start position:0%
they were uh because I'm having my
 
03:51:43.969 --> 03:51:43.979 align:start position:0%
period And I need some product and the
 
03:51:45.650 --> 03:51:45.660 align:start position:0%
answer at the school nurse will have to
 
03:51:48.229 --> 03:51:48.239 align:start position:0%
give under that set of circumstances is
 
03:51:51.650 --> 03:51:51.660 align:start position:0%
this is uh an unpended mandate so you
 
03:51:53.389 --> 03:51:53.399 align:start position:0%
don't get any more now because it's an
 
03:51:54.889 --> 03:51:54.899 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandate
 
03:51:58.250 --> 03:51:58.260 align:start position:0%
uh if my daughter was still at Concord
 
03:51:59.349 --> 03:51:59.359 align:start position:0%
High School
 
03:52:03.170 --> 03:52:03.180 align:start position:0%
uh at this point she would be testifying
 
03:52:05.510 --> 03:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
against this bill in a much more
 
03:52:09.469 --> 03:52:09.479 align:start position:0%
eloquent way than her father is doing uh
 
03:52:11.809 --> 03:52:11.819 align:start position:0%
I strenuously objected this bill and I
 
03:52:14.110 --> 03:52:14.120 align:start position:0%
would be voting against it
 
03:52:17.570 --> 03:52:17.580 align:start position:0%
very much represent Ellison uh represent
 
03:52:21.830 --> 03:52:21.840 align:start position:0%
Leon uh thank you Mr chair as I probably
 
03:52:23.750 --> 03:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
could speak uh most directly to this of
 
03:52:25.130 --> 03:52:25.140 align:start position:0%
everybody on the committee given that I
 
03:52:27.349 --> 03:52:27.359 align:start position:0%
have a one-year-old this is an issue
 
03:52:29.690 --> 03:52:29.700 align:start position:0%
that women and others who menstruate
 
03:52:32.809 --> 03:52:32.819 align:start position:0%
will be facing for decades this the
 
03:52:35.269 --> 03:52:35.279 align:start position:0%
schools provide a safe place in order to
 
03:52:37.729 --> 03:52:37.739 align:start position:0%
learn lessons some of those are
 
03:52:39.590 --> 03:52:39.600 align:start position:0%
the planning ahead that when you may be
 
03:52:42.650 --> 03:52:42.660 align:start position:0%
encountering this monthly event to have
 
03:52:44.510 --> 03:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
it in mind and also know what you're
 
03:52:46.870 --> 03:52:46.880 align:start position:0%
going to do if you are caught unaware
 
03:52:49.790 --> 03:52:49.800 align:start position:0%
School School nurses will have them they
 
03:52:51.290 --> 03:52:51.300 align:start position:0%
will be available they have been
 
03:52:53.510 --> 03:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
available it's just a matter of where
 
03:52:55.910 --> 03:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
and when and this is something where
 
03:52:57.650 --> 03:52:57.660 align:start position:0%
where girls and others will be able to
 
03:52:59.389 --> 03:52:59.399 align:start position:0%
go to the nurse and access these
 
03:53:01.429 --> 03:53:01.439 align:start position:0%
materials but that small amount of
 
03:53:03.290 --> 03:53:03.300 align:start position:0%
thinking to make sure that they can
 
03:53:05.150 --> 03:53:05.160 align:start position:0%
think ahead say oh it feels like this
 
03:53:07.490 --> 03:53:07.500 align:start position:0%
may be happening I'm going to go ahead
 
03:53:09.469 --> 03:53:09.479 align:start position:0%
and take the proactive step we'll save
 
03:53:11.570 --> 03:53:11.580 align:start position:0%
them from having a significant problem
 
03:53:14.090 --> 03:53:14.100 align:start position:0%
on the job or out at a store or
 
03:53:15.410 --> 03:53:15.420 align:start position:0%
somewhere else in the world where we
 
03:53:17.809 --> 03:53:17.819 align:start position:0%
don't mandate the free availability of
 
03:53:20.570 --> 03:53:20.580 align:start position:0%
these products there are stop Gap
 
03:53:22.729 --> 03:53:22.739 align:start position:0%
measures there's things that can be done
 
03:53:25.849 --> 03:53:25.859 align:start position:0%
but I think that where we
 
03:53:27.769 --> 03:53:27.779 align:start position:0%
have an unfunded mandate and there's
 
03:53:29.510 --> 03:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
also the issue that we're not preparing
 
03:53:31.250 --> 03:53:31.260 align:start position:0%
them for the real world I know that
 
03:53:32.570 --> 03:53:32.580 align:start position:0%
there is compassion these are available
 
03:53:34.250 --> 03:53:34.260 align:start position:0%
in the school nurses and this does not
 
03:53:36.290 --> 03:53:36.300 align:start position:0%
need to be legislated to the point it is
 
03:53:39.769 --> 03:53:39.779 align:start position:0%
we need to get this back out of the law
 
03:53:46.190 --> 03:53:46.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:50.750 --> 03:53:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:54.590 --> 03:53:54.600 align:start position:0%
Linda we can't hear you Linda
 
03:54:02.090 --> 03:54:02.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:12.229 --> 03:54:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:14.210 --> 03:54:14.220 align:start position:0%
now we can Linda we can't hear you now
 
03:54:17.150 --> 03:54:17.160 align:start position:0%
you can okay yeah
 
03:54:18.590 --> 03:54:18.600 align:start position:0%
um thank you
 
03:54:18.600 --> 03:54:20.269 align:start position:0%
um thank you
um

03:54:20.269 --> 03:54:20.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:54:23.269 --> 03:54:23.279 align:start position:0%
as you know I taught many years and I
 
03:54:25.849 --> 03:54:25.859 align:start position:0%
was the phys ed teacher so
 
03:54:29.269 --> 03:54:29.279 align:start position:0%
um oftentimes I had extra pads and and
 
03:54:33.469 --> 03:54:33.479 align:start position:0%
and tampons on hand for students that
 
03:54:35.150 --> 03:54:35.160 align:start position:0%
that uh really
 
03:54:39.050 --> 03:54:39.060 align:start position:0%
um and in adolescence uh periods can be
 
03:54:42.050 --> 03:54:42.060 align:start position:0%
very unpredictable and can be very
 
03:54:46.250 --> 03:54:46.260 align:start position:0%
lighter extremely heavy uh and for a
 
03:54:48.769 --> 03:54:48.779 align:start position:0%
young woman uh just starting in those
 
03:54:51.229 --> 03:54:51.239 align:start position:0%
Cycles um it isn't like it's every 28
 
03:54:53.870 --> 03:54:53.880 align:start position:0%
days it isn't like it's the same thing
 
03:54:56.809 --> 03:54:56.819 align:start position:0%
all the time it's it's really hard for
 
03:54:59.870 --> 03:54:59.880 align:start position:0%
them so that's one thing the second
 
03:55:02.210 --> 03:55:02.220 align:start position:0%
thing is that it's kind of like shaming
 
03:55:04.130 --> 03:55:04.140 align:start position:0%
it's uh like um
 
03:55:06.410 --> 03:55:06.420 align:start position:0%
with our we've talked about the the
 
03:55:08.750 --> 03:55:08.760 align:start position:0%
lunch program I guess that would be one
 
03:55:12.170 --> 03:55:12.180 align:start position:0%
of the examples I'd kind of use uh for a
 
03:55:14.269 --> 03:55:14.279 align:start position:0%
student to have to go to the nurse's
 
03:55:16.670 --> 03:55:16.680 align:start position:0%
office or even to come to the phys ed
 
03:55:21.710 --> 03:55:21.720 align:start position:0%
teacher and ask for uh a pad or a tampon
 
03:55:23.269 --> 03:55:23.279 align:start position:0%
um for
 
03:55:26.150 --> 03:55:26.160 align:start position:0%
some students it's no big deal
 
03:55:27.889 --> 03:55:27.899 align:start position:0%
but for a lot of students and
 
03:55:29.750 --> 03:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
particularly students that can't afford
 
03:55:29.760 --> 03:55:30.530 align:start position:0%
particularly students that can't afford
it

03:55:30.530 --> 03:55:30.540 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:55:33.410 --> 03:55:33.420 align:start position:0%
it is a huge huge deal
 
03:55:36.110 --> 03:55:36.120 align:start position:0%
and just to point out to you how huge
 
03:55:38.450 --> 03:55:38.460 align:start position:0%
and how misunderstood this whole thing
 
03:55:41.150 --> 03:55:41.160 align:start position:0%
is from an adult's point of view and
 
03:55:42.830 --> 03:55:42.840 align:start position:0%
particularly from a male adult's point
 
03:55:45.830 --> 03:55:45.840 align:start position:0%
of view is that for you for a couple of
 
03:55:48.469 --> 03:55:48.479 align:start position:0%
years the Jan a new janitor came on and
 
03:55:50.870 --> 03:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
he kept complaining that the that the
 
03:55:53.269 --> 03:55:53.279 align:start position:0%
toilet in the girls locker room was
 
03:55:55.610 --> 03:55:55.620 align:start position:0%
always getting plugged and he just he
 
03:55:58.309 --> 03:55:58.319 align:start position:0%
couldn't understand why young women just
 
03:55:59.510 --> 03:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
didn't understand that they weren't
 
03:56:01.729 --> 03:56:01.739 align:start position:0%
supposed to flush these products down
 
03:56:04.849 --> 03:56:04.859 align:start position:0%
the down the toilet and I said to him on
 
03:56:07.309 --> 03:56:07.319 align:start position:0%
numerous occasions the reason that
 
03:56:09.050 --> 03:56:09.060 align:start position:0%
you're getting this is because they
 
03:56:11.630 --> 03:56:11.640 align:start position:0%
don't want to walk across from the stall
 
03:56:15.170 --> 03:56:15.180 align:start position:0%
over to the wastebasket to dispose of
 
03:56:17.330 --> 03:56:17.340 align:start position:0%
the of the product and if you were to
 
03:56:20.030 --> 03:56:20.040 align:start position:0%
put the containers for them to put that
 
03:56:22.969 --> 03:56:22.979 align:start position:0%
away in between the Stalls so that they
 
03:56:25.309 --> 03:56:25.319 align:start position:0%
didn't have to leave the stall visibly
 
03:56:26.750 --> 03:56:26.760 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
03:56:29.330 --> 03:56:29.340 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't get the toilets backed up
 
03:56:32.210 --> 03:56:32.220 align:start position:0%
well it took a a few months of
 
03:56:34.370 --> 03:56:34.380 align:start position:0%
convincing he did it and you know what
 
03:56:37.670 --> 03:56:37.680 align:start position:0%
happened the toilets didn't plug up and
 
03:56:40.490 --> 03:56:40.500 align:start position:0%
it seems like such a small thing but
 
03:56:43.429 --> 03:56:43.439 align:start position:0%
that's how self-conscious young women
 
03:56:46.849 --> 03:56:46.859 align:start position:0%
and girls are about their periods and
 
03:56:46.859 --> 03:56:47.929 align:start position:0%
and girls are about their periods and
and

03:56:47.929 --> 03:56:47.939 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:56:50.090 --> 03:56:50.100 align:start position:0%
um so this bill
 
03:56:52.610 --> 03:56:52.620 align:start position:0%
um and the people that even at first in
 
03:56:55.370 --> 03:56:55.380 align:start position:0%
schools were like you know this is this
 
03:56:57.050 --> 03:56:57.060 align:start position:0%
is a problem this is going to be
 
03:56:59.590 --> 03:56:59.600 align:start position:0%
terrible you know
 
03:57:02.870 --> 03:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
now we're seeing the benefits we know
 
03:57:05.030 --> 03:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
that that girls and young women stay
 
03:57:08.630 --> 03:57:08.640 align:start position:0%
home they stay home they miss school
 
03:57:10.250 --> 03:57:10.260 align:start position:0%
um and they do it because they don't
 
03:57:12.830 --> 03:57:12.840 align:start position:0%
have the proper products we know that
 
03:57:15.590 --> 03:57:15.600 align:start position:0%
well if you're a woman you know that
 
03:57:18.710 --> 03:57:18.720 align:start position:0%
there are times when you least expect it
 
03:57:21.050 --> 03:57:21.060 align:start position:0%
and all of a sudden something fails on
 
03:57:24.170 --> 03:57:24.180 align:start position:0%
you and and it is it is embarrassing
 
03:57:26.870 --> 03:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
even as an adult sometimes to do that to
 
03:57:29.210 --> 03:57:29.220 align:start position:0%
to actually have to come up with
 
03:57:30.889 --> 03:57:30.899 align:start position:0%
something so
 
03:57:35.210 --> 03:57:35.220 align:start position:0%
um I can't believe how
 
03:57:35.220 --> 03:57:36.349 align:start position:0%
um I can't believe how
um

03:57:36.349 --> 03:57:36.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:57:40.010 --> 03:57:40.020 align:start position:0%
this bill is uh just just dismissive of
 
03:57:42.889 --> 03:57:42.899 align:start position:0%
young girls and and young women who who
 
03:57:47.269 --> 03:57:47.279 align:start position:0%
really need this uh this support and I
 
03:57:50.110 --> 03:57:50.120 align:start position:0%
uh can't believe that
 
03:57:54.830 --> 03:57:54.840 align:start position:0%
28a applies to a situation where the
 
03:57:57.469 --> 03:57:57.479 align:start position:0%
school's already buying paper towels
 
03:57:59.689 --> 03:57:59.699 align:start position:0%
toilet paper
 
03:58:02.269 --> 03:58:02.279 align:start position:0%
um they're buying uh hand sanitizer
 
03:58:02.279 --> 03:58:03.469 align:start position:0%
um they're buying uh hand sanitizer
machines

03:58:03.469 --> 03:58:03.479 align:start position:0%
machines
 
03:58:06.229 --> 03:58:06.239 align:start position:0%
all kinds of things around uh personal
 
03:58:09.410 --> 03:58:09.420 align:start position:0%
hygiene and this is a small addition to
 
03:58:12.290 --> 03:58:12.300 align:start position:0%
it I don't think it qualifies for 28a at
 
03:58:14.570 --> 03:58:14.580 align:start position:0%
all so I'm going to be voting against
 
03:58:16.490 --> 03:58:16.500 align:start position:0%
this bill thank you very much
 
03:58:19.370 --> 03:58:19.380 align:start position:0%
representative like this yes
 
03:58:21.710 --> 03:58:21.720 align:start position:0%
um the big expense in this
 
03:58:24.530 --> 03:58:24.540 align:start position:0%
uh was the machines and those have
 
03:58:26.510 --> 03:58:26.520 align:start position:0%
already been purchased I can't see a
 
03:58:28.910 --> 03:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
school taking them down just because we
 
03:58:31.370 --> 03:58:31.380 align:start position:0%
said it's not mandated anymore
 
03:58:31.380 --> 03:58:32.809 align:start position:0%
said it's not mandated anymore
this

03:58:32.809 --> 03:58:32.819 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:58:32.819 --> 03:58:34.870 align:start position:0%
this
um

03:58:34.870 --> 03:58:34.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:58:38.389 --> 03:58:38.399 align:start position:0%
it's it it's not saying don't do this
 
03:58:41.330 --> 03:58:41.340 align:start position:0%
you can't do this just because we're
 
03:58:43.330 --> 03:58:43.340 align:start position:0%
taking this
 
03:58:46.849 --> 03:58:46.859 align:start position:0%
repealing this 28-day violation bill it
 
03:58:49.130 --> 03:58:49.140 align:start position:0%
doesn't say stop doing it it says make
 
03:58:52.490 --> 03:58:52.500 align:start position:0%
your own decision on doing it
 
03:58:54.830 --> 03:58:54.840 align:start position:0%
um just like we make our own decision on
 
03:58:56.929 --> 03:58:56.939 align:start position:0%
toilet paper and paper towels and all
 
03:58:58.670 --> 03:58:58.680 align:start position:0%
those other things every school district
 
03:59:01.309 --> 03:59:01.319 align:start position:0%
makes their own decision and yes most of
 
03:59:03.410 --> 03:59:03.420 align:start position:0%
them provide it now schools are in the
 
03:59:04.849 --> 03:59:04.859 align:start position:0%
habit of providing it now they've
 
03:59:06.590 --> 03:59:06.600 align:start position:0%
already bought the machines
 
03:59:09.110 --> 03:59:09.120 align:start position:0%
so now it's not as big of a deal but
 
03:59:11.990 --> 03:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
they should be the ones who say yes this
 
03:59:14.510 --> 03:59:14.520 align:start position:0%
is what we're going to do yes we'll put
 
03:59:17.030 --> 03:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
it in our school operating budget yes we
 
03:59:19.550 --> 03:59:19.560 align:start position:0%
will do it not us mandating it when
 
03:59:22.309 --> 03:59:22.319 align:start position:0%
we're not providing the funds for it so
 
03:59:25.189 --> 03:59:25.199 align:start position:0%
it is a 28-day violation we should not
 
03:59:27.410 --> 03:59:27.420 align:start position:0%
be doing that we should leave it up to
 
03:59:29.030 --> 03:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
the school districts
 
03:59:31.010 --> 03:59:31.020 align:start position:0%
it's also our responsibility and we
 
03:59:33.110 --> 03:59:33.120 align:start position:0%
spend a long time last
 
03:59:37.189 --> 03:59:37.199 align:start position:0%
term making it clear that yes women do
 
03:59:39.469 --> 03:59:39.479 align:start position:0%
need this and if you recall any of you
 
03:59:42.229 --> 03:59:42.239 align:start position:0%
who were here I I spoke on this
 
03:59:45.110 --> 03:59:45.120 align:start position:0%
from the floor and I started out with
 
03:59:47.689 --> 03:59:47.699 align:start position:0%
the story of how women needed this and
 
03:59:49.910 --> 03:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
how they weren't coming I'm not there's
 
03:59:52.550 --> 03:59:52.560 align:start position:0%
no argument about that but I ended with
 
03:59:56.450 --> 03:59:56.460 align:start position:0%
but it's a 28-a violation we can do this
 
04:00:00.290 --> 04:00:00.300 align:start position:0%
we can volunteer to supply things the
 
04:00:02.809 --> 04:00:02.819 align:start position:0%
schools can look for things they can get
 
04:00:07.010 --> 04:00:07.020 align:start position:0%
they can get um charitable donations of
 
04:00:10.250 --> 04:00:10.260 align:start position:0%
supplies they can take collections and
 
04:00:12.229 --> 04:00:12.239 align:start position:0%
have a collection box where people can
 
04:00:14.870 --> 04:00:14.880 align:start position:0%
drop them off and then they can be put
 
04:00:17.809 --> 04:00:17.819 align:start position:0%
in the machines whatever but we
 
04:00:21.590 --> 04:00:21.600 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be mandating it and that's
 
04:00:23.210 --> 04:00:23.220 align:start position:0%
that's it thank you very much
 
04:00:23.220 --> 04:00:25.370 align:start position:0%
that's it thank you very much
representative

04:00:25.370 --> 04:00:25.380 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:00:27.469 --> 04:00:27.479 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Vlad
 
04:00:29.570 --> 04:00:29.580 align:start position:0%
um and I do have to speak in this I know
 
04:00:32.630 --> 04:00:32.640 align:start position:0%
it's going to be similar to uh
 
04:00:35.269 --> 04:00:35.279 align:start position:0%
276 afterwards so I'm hoping we get this
 
04:00:37.309 --> 04:00:37.319 align:start position:0%
all done at once
 
04:00:37.319 --> 04:00:38.450 align:start position:0%
all done at once
um

04:00:38.450 --> 04:00:38.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:00:41.630 --> 04:00:41.640 align:start position:0%
I I do this does bother me this bill
 
04:00:43.729 --> 04:00:43.739 align:start position:0%
this this uh
 
04:00:46.670 --> 04:00:46.680 align:start position:0%
OTP and I'll tell you why uh first off
 
04:00:50.090 --> 04:00:50.100 align:start position:0%
not the least of that the governor took
 
04:00:54.530 --> 04:00:54.540 align:start position:0%
major photo ops press releases and said
 
04:00:57.530 --> 04:00:57.540 align:start position:0%
this final levels of seal for women last
 
04:00:59.809 --> 04:00:59.819 align:start position:0%
June when he sat there stood there with
 
04:01:02.269 --> 04:01:02.279 align:start position:0%
Colleen if you recall the young lady who
 
04:01:05.330 --> 04:01:05.340 align:start position:0%
brought this bill to the committee
 
04:01:06.650 --> 04:01:06.660 align:start position:0%
um that's the first thing the second
 
04:01:09.469 --> 04:01:09.479 align:start position:0%
thing I find kind of ironic this and uh
 
04:01:11.510 --> 04:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
National Women's months here that that
 
04:01:14.689 --> 04:01:14.699 align:start position:0%
we bring this bill up but beyond that
 
04:01:16.849 --> 04:01:16.859 align:start position:0%
uh having been in high school settings
 
04:01:19.729 --> 04:01:19.739 align:start position:0%
in Middle School settings and coached uh
 
04:01:22.250 --> 04:01:22.260 align:start position:0%
it follows me I'll tell you why
 
04:01:24.910 --> 04:01:24.920 align:start position:0%
take an average uh adolescent young lady
 
04:01:28.610 --> 04:01:28.620 align:start position:0%
who has heavy flow three days of just
 
04:01:30.349 --> 04:01:30.359 align:start position:0%
three days a month
 
04:01:32.570 --> 04:01:32.580 align:start position:0%
so three days a month
 
04:01:36.650 --> 04:01:36.660 align:start position:0%
times 10 months is 30 school days now
 
04:01:38.150 --> 04:01:38.160 align:start position:0%
that's not a month that's actually six
 
04:01:40.189 --> 04:01:40.199 align:start position:0%
weeks of school time
 
04:01:43.130 --> 04:01:43.140 align:start position:0%
when the youngsters do not come to
 
04:01:45.110 --> 04:01:45.120 align:start position:0%
school if they don't have sufficient
 
04:01:46.910 --> 04:01:46.920 align:start position:0%
products it's not a case where they can
 
04:01:48.530 --> 04:01:48.540 align:start position:0%
plan for it it's the case they can't
 
04:01:51.170 --> 04:01:51.180 align:start position:0%
afford it and that's why they don't come
 
04:01:54.050 --> 04:01:54.060 align:start position:0%
so if you look at it from grades 7
 
04:01:58.429 --> 04:01:58.439 align:start position:0%
through 12 that's 180 days of times
 
04:02:01.729 --> 04:02:01.739 align:start position:0%
those youngsters do not come to school
 
04:02:04.010 --> 04:02:04.020 align:start position:0%
well it doesn't seem to me like that's a
 
04:02:06.650 --> 04:02:06.660 align:start position:0%
very good investment for the teacher a
 
04:02:08.929 --> 04:02:08.939 align:start position:0%
teacher would get 15 days off a year for
 
04:02:12.530 --> 04:02:12.540 align:start position:0%
sick leave but not 30. most people in
 
04:02:14.990 --> 04:02:15.000 align:start position:0%
employment in an industry get what one
 
04:02:17.990 --> 04:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
one and a half days a month not 30 but
 
04:02:19.849 --> 04:02:19.859 align:start position:0%
this is not a sick piece
 
04:02:22.849 --> 04:02:22.859 align:start position:0%
um school is like work we tell the
 
04:02:24.830 --> 04:02:24.840 align:start position:0%
students this is work it's your job to
 
04:02:26.590 --> 04:02:26.600 align:start position:0%
come to school be prepared
 
04:02:29.570 --> 04:02:29.580 align:start position:0%
well we this is their work and we tell
 
04:02:32.210 --> 04:02:32.220 align:start position:0%
The Adolescents the same thing so if you
 
04:02:34.550 --> 04:02:34.560 align:start position:0%
go back to that number that number of of
 
04:02:37.490 --> 04:02:37.500 align:start position:0%
30 days a year
 
04:02:39.830 --> 04:02:39.840 align:start position:0%
um even at five bucks a pop we're
 
04:02:42.889 --> 04:02:42.899 align:start position:0%
talking three hundred dollars well let's
 
04:02:45.050 --> 04:02:45.060 align:start position:0%
see over the course of six years
 
04:02:47.630 --> 04:02:47.640 align:start position:0%
and what's the average tax bill and some
 
04:02:50.210 --> 04:02:50.220 align:start position:0%
in some schools for uh per person around
 
04:02:53.389 --> 04:02:53.399 align:start position:0%
12 or 13 14 000 the middle average rate
 
04:02:55.309 --> 04:02:55.319 align:start position:0%
was 69 and then some schools like
 
04:02:58.610 --> 04:02:58.620 align:start position:0%
Moulton Borough 32 000 well they
 
04:02:59.990 --> 04:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
probably don't have that problem but we
 
04:03:01.969 --> 04:03:01.979 align:start position:0%
look at those those range of school
 
04:03:04.309 --> 04:03:04.319 align:start position:0%
districts uh like a key like like a
 
04:03:06.830 --> 04:03:06.840 align:start position:0%
Manchester like uh Conway you take that
 
04:03:09.290 --> 04:03:09.300 align:start position:0%
so that student has lost a whole year of
 
04:03:12.349 --> 04:03:12.359 align:start position:0%
schooling from seven to twelve and for
 
04:03:14.990 --> 04:03:15.000 align:start position:0%
saving 500 bucks versus wasting
 
04:03:17.510 --> 04:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
seventeen thousand dollars
 
04:03:19.309 --> 04:03:19.319 align:start position:0%
um that's that's a huge that's a huge
 
04:03:21.229 --> 04:03:21.239 align:start position:0%
loss of wasted investment not to mention
 
04:03:23.090 --> 04:03:23.100 align:start position:0%
particularly in the younger grades when
 
04:03:25.370 --> 04:03:25.380 align:start position:0%
the student comes back to school
 
04:03:27.769 --> 04:03:27.779 align:start position:0%
she had if she missed a key a key
 
04:03:29.689 --> 04:03:29.699 align:start position:0%
concept or a key lesson that has to be
 
04:03:31.849 --> 04:03:31.859 align:start position:0%
re-taught that's another problem um so
 
04:03:34.670 --> 04:03:34.680 align:start position:0%
that bothers me but the the reality is
 
04:03:34.680 --> 04:03:36.229 align:start position:0%
that bothers me but the the reality is
that

04:03:36.229 --> 04:03:36.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:03:38.389 --> 04:03:38.399 align:start position:0%
these young kids
 
04:03:41.150 --> 04:03:41.160 align:start position:0%
are at the bottom of the social economic
 
04:03:41.160 --> 04:03:42.349 align:start position:0%
are at the bottom of the social economic
class

04:03:42.349 --> 04:03:42.359 align:start position:0%
class
 
04:03:44.809 --> 04:03:44.819 align:start position:0%
this is a case of The Haves and the
 
04:03:46.969 --> 04:03:46.979 align:start position:0%
have-nots this is basically a case of
 
04:03:49.370 --> 04:03:49.380 align:start position:0%
discrimination where we klept the class
 
04:03:51.950 --> 04:03:51.960 align:start position:0%
we wonder why we wonder why when you
 
04:03:54.410 --> 04:03:54.420 align:start position:0%
look at all your statistics on academic
 
04:03:56.389 --> 04:03:56.399 align:start position:0%
achievement the social ultimate class at
 
04:03:57.830 --> 04:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
the bottom typically has the most
 
04:03:59.689 --> 04:03:59.699 align:start position:0%
difficult time well it's more difficult
 
04:04:02.030 --> 04:04:02.040 align:start position:0%
if they're not there so that that that's
 
04:04:04.309 --> 04:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
a concern to me candidly
 
04:04:06.650 --> 04:04:06.660 align:start position:0%
um and that's exactly where that term
 
04:04:09.170 --> 04:04:09.180 align:start position:0%
period poverty came from
 
04:04:11.210 --> 04:04:11.220 align:start position:0%
that these people these youngsters these
 
04:04:14.570 --> 04:04:14.580 align:start position:0%
women adolescents are in poverty now
 
04:04:16.429 --> 04:04:16.439 align:start position:0%
some of you are on this table even the
 
04:04:17.809 --> 04:04:17.819 align:start position:0%
men with the white shirts and ties on
 
04:04:19.910 --> 04:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
may have got a phone call somewhere
 
04:04:21.830 --> 04:04:21.840 align:start position:0%
along the line if you had a a daughter
 
04:04:25.490 --> 04:04:25.500 align:start position:0%
and said geez can you come to school and
 
04:04:28.130 --> 04:04:28.140 align:start position:0%
bring Sally a change of clothes because
 
04:04:29.630 --> 04:04:29.640 align:start position:0%
she had an accident
 
04:04:31.309 --> 04:04:31.319 align:start position:0%
and you say oh yeah we'll rushed right
 
04:04:34.250 --> 04:04:34.260 align:start position:0%
up or can you just take her home because
 
04:04:36.830 --> 04:04:36.840 align:start position:0%
she had an accident well that doesn't
 
04:04:39.110 --> 04:04:39.120 align:start position:0%
that's just my dog agreeing that that
 
04:04:41.689 --> 04:04:41.699 align:start position:0%
doesn't that doesn't happen when you
 
04:04:45.050 --> 04:04:45.060 align:start position:0%
call a single parent who's in a lower uh
 
04:04:47.870 --> 04:04:47.880 align:start position:0%
so economic heat class who's working on
 
04:04:50.689 --> 04:04:50.699 align:start position:0%
a part-time job I can't come to school I
 
04:04:52.550 --> 04:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
can't leave my job I don't have a spare
 
04:04:54.290 --> 04:04:54.300 align:start position:0%
Feast we had enough money to stop well
 
04:04:56.330 --> 04:04:56.340 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't be there so that young lady
 
04:04:58.309 --> 04:04:58.319 align:start position:0%
sits in the nurse's office or assists in
 
04:04:59.689 --> 04:04:59.699 align:start position:0%
the assistant principal's office so
 
04:05:01.370 --> 04:05:01.380 align:start position:0%
those things are kind of concerning to
 
04:05:01.380 --> 04:05:02.510 align:start position:0%
those things are kind of concerning to
me

04:05:02.510 --> 04:05:02.520 align:start position:0%
me
 
04:05:04.429 --> 04:05:04.439 align:start position:0%
um it just makes it it does make me
 
04:05:07.309 --> 04:05:07.319 align:start position:0%
awesome and I will look at the 28a piece
 
04:05:10.429 --> 04:05:10.439 align:start position:0%
I understand the you know it's a 28a 28a
 
04:05:13.790 --> 04:05:13.800 align:start position:0%
but we do have the one case one case of
 
04:05:16.070 --> 04:05:16.080 align:start position:0%
the City versus the city of Concord
 
04:05:17.990 --> 04:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
versus the state
 
04:05:20.630 --> 04:05:20.640 align:start position:0%
in that case the Court ruled the New
 
04:05:22.610 --> 04:05:22.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court ruled
 
04:05:24.650 --> 04:05:24.660 align:start position:0%
we're a local subdivision in this case
 
04:05:28.010 --> 04:05:28.020 align:start position:0%
had a responsibility for the subject
 
04:05:30.170 --> 04:05:30.180 align:start position:0%
Matter's case so some change in the
 
04:05:32.570 --> 04:05:32.580 align:start position:0%
scope of responsibility including an
 
04:05:34.030 --> 04:05:34.040 align:start position:0%
increase in financial responsibility
 
04:05:38.689 --> 04:05:38.699 align:start position:0%
does not result in a 28a violation so I
 
04:05:41.150 --> 04:05:41.160 align:start position:0%
would suggest to you that if we are if
 
04:05:42.590 --> 04:05:42.600 align:start position:0%
you really want to go out in that Limb
 
04:05:45.729 --> 04:05:45.739 align:start position:0%
and use 28a if we are using that concept
 
04:05:49.070 --> 04:05:49.080 align:start position:0%
then the schools already provide as some
 
04:05:52.969 --> 04:05:52.979 align:start position:0%
folks have said some uh products for the
 
04:05:55.550 --> 04:05:55.560 align:start position:0%
nurse's office some product perhaps for
 
04:05:58.189 --> 04:05:58.199 align:start position:0%
the physi teacher so they REI providing
 
04:06:00.050 --> 04:06:00.060 align:start position:0%
it so if you look at if you look at the
 
04:06:03.050 --> 04:06:03.060 align:start position:0%
the intention of city of Concord versus
 
04:06:05.030 --> 04:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
the state the new the New Hampshire
 
04:06:07.070 --> 04:06:07.080 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court ruled that when you expand
 
04:06:09.050 --> 04:06:09.060 align:start position:0%
that it's not a 28a violation in that
 
04:06:09.060 --> 04:06:09.950 align:start position:0%
that it's not a 28a violation in that
case

04:06:09.950 --> 04:06:09.960 align:start position:0%
case
 
04:06:12.530 --> 04:06:12.540 align:start position:0%
uh so I'll leave you with one story and
 
04:06:15.170 --> 04:06:15.180 align:start position:0%
one comment the story was when I said
 
04:06:16.670 --> 04:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
this on the floor of the house last year
 
04:06:17.929 --> 04:06:17.939 align:start position:0%
this is my first a few years ago my
 
04:06:19.429 --> 04:06:19.439 align:start position:0%
first well speak
 
04:06:22.670 --> 04:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:25.130 --> 04:06:25.140 align:start position:0%
when I was coaching
 
04:06:27.950 --> 04:06:27.960 align:start position:0%
I had a softball team of young women
 
04:06:29.689 --> 04:06:29.699 align:start position:0%
only 10 kids they weren't very good
 
04:06:31.790 --> 04:06:31.800 align:start position:0%
probably couldn't be coached better
 
04:06:34.370 --> 04:06:34.380 align:start position:0%
um but we we're doing okay and we go to
 
04:06:35.929 --> 04:06:35.939 align:start position:0%
our first home game
 
04:06:38.870 --> 04:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
and I look in the field warming up and I
 
04:06:40.429 --> 04:06:40.439 align:start position:0%
said to the girls but where's someone so
 
04:06:42.650 --> 04:06:42.660 align:start position:0%
I where's that shot stop and they said
 
04:06:44.269 --> 04:06:44.279 align:start position:0%
well coach she hasn't come to school
 
04:06:46.670 --> 04:06:46.680 align:start position:0%
today I said why not she says because
 
04:06:48.650 --> 04:06:48.660 align:start position:0%
all we have is white uniforms it's her
 
04:06:50.389 --> 04:06:50.399 align:start position:0%
time of the month she never comes to
 
04:06:52.790 --> 04:06:52.800 align:start position:0%
school during her time of the month I
 
04:06:55.130 --> 04:06:55.140 align:start position:0%
mean this is just a it's not like an
 
04:06:56.929 --> 04:06:56.939 align:start position:0%
unusual thing this is these kids know
 
04:06:59.450 --> 04:06:59.460 align:start position:0%
this I mean there's a clear stigma for
 
04:07:01.370 --> 04:07:01.380 align:start position:0%
girls if we look at adolescent young
 
04:07:02.689 --> 04:07:02.699 align:start position:0%
women and they're supposed to be
 
04:07:03.889 --> 04:07:03.899 align:start position:0%
building confidence and building their
 
04:07:05.929 --> 04:07:05.939 align:start position:0%
identity and we do this we say oh no but
 
04:07:07.790 --> 04:07:07.800 align:start position:0%
stay home or just uh we don't have any
 
04:07:09.650 --> 04:07:09.660 align:start position:0%
help we can help you and I'll leave you
 
04:07:11.510 --> 04:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
with a couple comments I heard to her
 
04:07:12.769 --> 04:07:12.779 align:start position:0%
this morning
 
04:07:15.469 --> 04:07:15.479 align:start position:0%
one was from representative Moffett this
 
04:07:17.809 --> 04:07:17.819 align:start position:0%
is a chance to serve in underserved
 
04:07:20.450 --> 04:07:20.460 align:start position:0%
population that's exactly what it is and
 
04:07:22.550 --> 04:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
I would also suggest you every time we
 
04:07:23.630 --> 04:07:23.640 align:start position:0%
hear the good representative from
 
04:07:25.189 --> 04:07:25.199 align:start position:0%
moultonborough speak when he gets
 
04:07:26.570 --> 04:07:26.580 align:start position:0%
emotional about something that's passion
 
04:07:29.090 --> 04:07:29.100 align:start position:0%
to him he'll say to us well what about
 
04:07:31.550 --> 04:07:31.560 align:start position:0%
the human cost what about the cost of
 
04:07:33.349 --> 04:07:33.359 align:start position:0%
kids for crying out loud and that's
 
04:07:35.450 --> 04:07:35.460 align:start position:0%
exactly what he says and this is the
 
04:07:37.610 --> 04:07:37.620 align:start position:0%
cost of the kids what about the cost of
 
04:07:42.610 --> 04:07:42.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:45.650 --> 04:07:45.660 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair uh representative
 
04:07:47.269 --> 04:07:47.279 align:start position:0%
Woodcock brings up a couple of good
 
04:07:49.189 --> 04:07:49.199 align:start position:0%
points some of these young girls with
 
04:07:50.689 --> 04:07:50.699 align:start position:0%
very very happy
 
04:07:52.849 --> 04:07:52.859 align:start position:0%
probably need to make sure that there's
 
04:07:55.010 --> 04:07:55.020 align:start position:0%
not actually an underlying issue uh
 
04:07:56.450 --> 04:07:56.460 align:start position:0%
beyond that once they've been checked
 
04:07:57.650 --> 04:07:57.660 align:start position:0%
out and they know that this isn't
 
04:07:59.269 --> 04:07:59.279 align:start position:0%
actually a health problem they're not
 
04:08:01.490 --> 04:08:01.500 align:start position:0%
going to be well served by the same same
 
04:08:02.929 --> 04:08:02.939 align:start position:0%
products would be available for
 
04:08:06.110 --> 04:08:06.120 align:start position:0%
everybody in the bathroom I'm sure I'm
 
04:08:07.790 --> 04:08:07.800 align:start position:0%
sure that the gentleman Representatives
 
04:08:09.170 --> 04:08:09.180 align:start position:0%
here don't really know the difference
 
04:08:11.269 --> 04:08:11.279 align:start position:0%
between the the different products on
 
04:08:13.969 --> 04:08:13.979 align:start position:0%
the market but if you had the products
 
04:08:15.650 --> 04:08:15.660 align:start position:0%
that would help these young girls with
 
04:08:18.530 --> 04:08:18.540 align:start position:0%
very heavy flows in the bathrooms you'd
 
04:08:21.050 --> 04:08:21.060 align:start position:0%
be putting other girls Health at risk
 
04:08:23.030 --> 04:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
for tops of shop syndrome if you were
 
04:08:25.130 --> 04:08:25.140 align:start position:0%
offering that level of protection in the
 
04:08:28.010 --> 04:08:28.020 align:start position:0%
tampon this is an area where if you have
 
04:08:30.530 --> 04:08:30.540 align:start position:0%
that individualized product available in
 
04:08:32.510 --> 04:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
the nurse's office you can figure out
 
04:08:34.250 --> 04:08:34.260 align:start position:0%
what you need and by being able to go to
 
04:08:35.750 --> 04:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
the nurse you can get whatever high
 
04:08:38.450 --> 04:08:38.460 align:start position:0%
intensity products you need I know that
 
04:08:40.729 --> 04:08:40.739 align:start position:0%
this is being met this was a way that it
 
04:08:44.290 --> 04:08:44.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:47.150 --> 04:08:47.160 align:start position:0%
away this is a matter of making sure
 
04:08:49.189 --> 04:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
that if the basket runs out nobody gets
 
04:08:51.110 --> 04:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
in trouble just making sure that this
 
04:08:53.570 --> 04:08:53.580 align:start position:0%
goes back to a common sense issue and we
 
04:08:54.769 --> 04:08:54.779 align:start position:0%
also want to make sure that these girls
 
04:08:56.150 --> 04:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
can feel comfortable going to the
 
04:08:58.070 --> 04:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
nurse's office and they don't have to
 
04:09:00.349 --> 04:09:00.359 align:start position:0%
wear something the color of my my dress
 
04:09:02.030 --> 04:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
today in order to feel comfortable those
 
04:09:04.429 --> 04:09:04.439 align:start position:0%
days just because what's provided in the
 
04:09:06.469 --> 04:09:06.479 align:start position:0%
bathroom is inadequate for their needs
 
04:09:09.590 --> 04:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
04:09:12.650 --> 04:09:12.660 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um
 
04:09:15.110 --> 04:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
I'll confess right away that I have
 
04:09:16.969 --> 04:09:16.979 align:start position:0%
absolutely no
 
04:09:20.590 --> 04:09:20.600 align:start position:0%
expertise in this subject
 
04:09:24.050 --> 04:09:24.060 align:start position:0%
beyond the question of it being a 20
 
04:09:26.870 --> 04:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
minute a day issue
 
04:09:30.830 --> 04:09:30.840 align:start position:0%
and if this is an important issue for us
 
04:09:33.769 --> 04:09:33.779 align:start position:0%
as a policy plot
 
04:09:38.809 --> 04:09:38.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:41.750 --> 04:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
and simple we need to write that check
 
04:09:44.809 --> 04:09:44.819 align:start position:0%
to the school districts and I
 
04:09:48.710 --> 04:09:48.720 align:start position:0%
admitted I come from a small visitor
 
04:09:51.410 --> 04:09:51.420 align:start position:0%
but in doing the research on this bill
 
04:09:53.750 --> 04:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
in my district
 
04:09:56.450 --> 04:09:56.460 align:start position:0%
based on the last bill that we passed
 
04:10:00.469 --> 04:10:00.479 align:start position:0%
two years ago my district opted not to
 
04:10:05.110 --> 04:10:05.120 align:start position:0%
purchase any Machinery uh for this
 
04:10:09.349 --> 04:10:09.359 align:start position:0%
instead they dispatch periodically a
 
04:10:13.670 --> 04:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
School employee to the local food bank
 
04:10:16.490 --> 04:10:16.500 align:start position:0%
where they have made a under the table
 
04:10:20.870 --> 04:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
deal with the food bank to take products
 
04:10:23.750 --> 04:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
from the food bank and send it to the
 
04:10:26.229 --> 04:10:26.239 align:start position:0%
school which is a dubious
 
04:10:31.010 --> 04:10:31.020 align:start position:0%
uh a dubious connection at best
 
04:10:34.309 --> 04:10:34.319 align:start position:0%
um again I go back to if this is
 
04:10:34.319 --> 04:10:35.510 align:start position:0%
um again I go back to if this is
important

04:10:35.510 --> 04:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
important
 
04:10:39.170 --> 04:10:39.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:42.110 --> 04:10:42.120 align:start position:0%
we heard some examples and the word like
 
04:10:45.769 --> 04:10:45.779 align:start position:0%
180 dollars to one of the large District
 
04:10:48.170 --> 04:10:48.180 align:start position:0%
well of course in my district it's
 
04:10:51.410 --> 04:10:51.420 align:start position:0%
nothing akin to them but the four
 
04:10:53.809 --> 04:10:53.819 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars in my district was a
 
04:10:58.490 --> 04:10:58.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:02.870 --> 04:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
it's it's not a matter of
 
04:11:05.150 --> 04:11:05.160 align:start position:0%
not wanting these young women to have
 
04:11:08.330 --> 04:11:08.340 align:start position:0%
what they need it's a matter of paying
 
04:11:10.729 --> 04:11:10.739 align:start position:0%
for it and if we're going to take a
 
04:11:10.739 --> 04:11:11.929 align:start position:0%
for it and if we're going to take a
stand

04:11:11.929 --> 04:11:11.939 align:start position:0%
stand
 
04:11:14.750 --> 04:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
and say it's important then we need to
 
04:11:17.570 --> 04:11:17.580 align:start position:0%
make it important with our checkbook
 
04:11:22.729 --> 04:11:22.739 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh representative uh
 
04:11:25.010 --> 04:11:25.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
04:11:28.790 --> 04:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
um I find this to be an embarrassment
 
04:11:33.050 --> 04:11:33.060 align:start position:0%
um to to remove this requirement uh to
 
04:11:34.969 --> 04:11:34.979 align:start position:0%
act as if it will have no impact
 
04:11:34.979 --> 04:11:36.710 align:start position:0%
act as if it will have no impact
whatsoever

04:11:36.710 --> 04:11:36.720 align:start position:0%
whatsoever
 
04:11:39.229 --> 04:11:39.239 align:start position:0%
um is a complete embarrassment
 
04:11:41.750 --> 04:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
um it ignores the fact that there are
 
04:11:44.330 --> 04:11:44.340 align:start position:0%
many students who cannot afford these
 
04:11:44.340 --> 04:11:45.889 align:start position:0%
many students who cannot afford these
products

04:11:45.889 --> 04:11:45.899 align:start position:0%
products
 
04:11:48.950 --> 04:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
um it ignores the impact that rep my
 
04:11:50.570 --> 04:11:50.580 align:start position:0%
colleague representative Woodcock
 
04:11:52.849 --> 04:11:52.859 align:start position:0%
mentioned in terms of uh repeated
 
04:11:56.389 --> 04:11:56.399 align:start position:0%
absences you know we already have in
 
04:11:58.490 --> 04:11:58.500 align:start position:0%
statute the requirement that an employer
 
04:12:00.710 --> 04:12:00.720 align:start position:0%
shall maintain reasonable and proper
 
04:12:02.870 --> 04:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
toilet facilities and sent reasonable
 
04:12:04.910 --> 04:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
sanitary and hygienic conditions for
 
04:12:07.910 --> 04:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
employees so we have that in law for
 
04:12:09.830 --> 04:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
employers and employees but we're not
 
04:12:12.650 --> 04:12:12.660 align:start position:0%
going to have that in law for students
 
04:12:14.809 --> 04:12:14.819 align:start position:0%
I mean I just find that amazing and I'm
 
04:12:16.550 --> 04:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
going to be happy to go back to my
 
04:12:19.429 --> 04:12:19.439 align:start position:0%
constituents and remind them that my
 
04:12:21.769 --> 04:12:21.779 align:start position:0%
colleagues here now believe uh that the
 
04:12:24.170 --> 04:12:24.180 align:start position:0%
provision of toilet paper is no longer a
 
04:12:26.929 --> 04:12:26.939 align:start position:0%
necessity or required whatsoever uh and
 
04:12:28.910 --> 04:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
that the school district can save money
 
04:12:30.889 --> 04:12:30.899 align:start position:0%
by eliminating that as well so I'll be
 
04:12:35.929 --> 04:12:35.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:38.389 --> 04:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
yes I just want to address various of
 
04:12:40.630 --> 04:12:40.640 align:start position:0%
the issues made
 
04:12:42.769 --> 04:12:42.779 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock that was a
 
04:12:44.570 --> 04:12:44.580 align:start position:0%
wonderful argument as to why we need to
 
04:12:47.210 --> 04:12:47.220 align:start position:0%
provide these every district has
 
04:12:49.610 --> 04:12:49.620 align:start position:0%
Representatives every district has
 
04:12:52.429 --> 04:12:52.439 align:start position:0%
Representatives who care about this so I
 
04:12:53.929 --> 04:12:53.939 align:start position:0%
would love to see you go to your school
 
04:12:55.670 --> 04:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
district and convince them with those
 
04:12:57.650 --> 04:12:57.660 align:start position:0%
wonderful arguments that you had about
 
04:12:59.929 --> 04:12:59.939 align:start position:0%
why your school district should make
 
04:13:03.110 --> 04:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
sure and provide these things
 
04:13:05.030 --> 04:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
um that they should decide to do that
 
04:13:06.889 --> 04:13:06.899 align:start position:0%
and provide them
 
04:13:11.689 --> 04:13:11.699 align:start position:0%
and there are there are numerous
 
04:13:15.229 --> 04:13:15.239 align:start position:0%
um companies who will provide these you
 
04:13:16.790 --> 04:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
can make arrangements and some of the
 
04:13:19.370 --> 04:13:19.380 align:start position:0%
school districts have made arrangements
 
04:13:22.849 --> 04:13:22.859 align:start position:0%
to get supplies from them for free or
 
04:13:25.130 --> 04:13:25.140 align:start position:0%
for very inexpensive for very little
 
04:13:25.140 --> 04:13:26.689 align:start position:0%
for very inexpensive for very little
money

04:13:26.689 --> 04:13:26.699 align:start position:0%
money
 
04:13:28.490 --> 04:13:28.500 align:start position:0%
um specifically because it's good
 
04:13:30.290 --> 04:13:30.300 align:start position:0%
advertising for these products because
 
04:13:33.229 --> 04:13:33.239 align:start position:0%
if girls use these this particular brand
 
04:13:36.410 --> 04:13:36.420 align:start position:0%
in school when they become adults and
 
04:13:38.030 --> 04:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
start buying their own
 
04:13:40.429 --> 04:13:40.439 align:start position:0%
they will follow through with what they
 
04:13:43.189 --> 04:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
used there in the school
 
04:13:45.889 --> 04:13:45.899 align:start position:0%
um some girls do not go to school during
 
04:13:47.689 --> 04:13:47.699 align:start position:0%
their period and it has nothing to do
 
04:13:50.389 --> 04:13:50.399 align:start position:0%
with having or not having products it
 
04:13:53.269 --> 04:13:53.279 align:start position:0%
may have to do with extreme cramps Etc I
 
04:13:55.189 --> 04:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
certainly Miss days
 
04:13:57.110 --> 04:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
because of that even though I had
 
04:13:58.849 --> 04:13:58.859 align:start position:0%
products and the other thing is white
 
04:14:00.710 --> 04:14:00.720 align:start position:0%
uniforms I know plenty of girls who have
 
04:14:02.090 --> 04:14:02.100 align:start position:0%
problems with that
 
04:14:04.490 --> 04:14:04.500 align:start position:0%
during that time of month even if they
 
04:14:07.250 --> 04:14:07.260 align:start position:0%
have products because they don't always
 
04:14:09.830 --> 04:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
stay contained I have certainly had to
 
04:14:12.290 --> 04:14:12.300 align:start position:0%
get clothing from the nurse's office
 
04:14:16.010 --> 04:14:16.020 align:start position:0%
even though I had a product
 
04:14:18.349 --> 04:14:18.359 align:start position:0%
um because accidents happen sometimes
 
04:14:21.229 --> 04:14:21.239 align:start position:0%
you overflow that's you know there are
 
04:14:22.610 --> 04:14:22.620 align:start position:0%
all these issues are things that women
 
04:14:24.590 --> 04:14:24.600 align:start position:0%
deal with
 
04:14:27.050 --> 04:14:27.060 align:start position:0%
and girls deal with and I was a very shy
 
04:14:29.210 --> 04:14:29.220 align:start position:0%
person I certainly did not want to go to
 
04:14:31.490 --> 04:14:31.500 align:start position:0%
the nurse fortunately one of my friends
 
04:14:34.309 --> 04:14:34.319 align:start position:0%
volunteered to walk with me because I
 
04:14:36.889 --> 04:14:36.899 align:start position:0%
was hopelessly embarrassed
 
04:14:39.170 --> 04:14:39.180 align:start position:0%
um but I still see
 
04:14:41.750 --> 04:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
I I'm not saying we don't need this I'm
 
04:14:44.330 --> 04:14:44.340 align:start position:0%
not saying and I did not say we should
 
04:14:46.670 --> 04:14:46.680 align:start position:0%
not supply toilet paper I'm saying that
 
04:14:49.910 --> 04:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
schools do Supply toilet paper on their
 
04:14:53.330 --> 04:14:53.340 align:start position:0%
own decision and so they can supply this
 
04:14:56.210 --> 04:14:56.220 align:start position:0%
on their own decision and if we think a
 
04:14:58.790 --> 04:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
school should do that we all have the
 
04:15:01.189 --> 04:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
ability to go to our school and convince
 
04:15:03.769 --> 04:15:03.779 align:start position:0%
them with wonderful arguments like like
 
04:15:06.830 --> 04:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
uh representative woodpock had let's go
 
04:15:09.170 --> 04:15:09.180 align:start position:0%
to our districts let's say yes but you
 
04:15:10.490 --> 04:15:10.500 align:start position:0%
should be supplied by the school
 
04:15:10.500 --> 04:15:11.330 align:start position:0%
should be supplied by the school
district

04:15:11.330 --> 04:15:11.340 align:start position:0%
district
 
04:15:13.010 --> 04:15:13.020 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't mean the school district
 
04:15:15.050 --> 04:15:15.060 align:start position:0%
has to pay for it either there are
 
04:15:17.570 --> 04:15:17.580 align:start position:0%
plenty of other ways for them to get it
 
04:15:19.849 --> 04:15:19.859 align:start position:0%
my granddaughter as part of the Girl
 
04:15:23.450 --> 04:15:23.460 align:start position:0%
Scout project went to various local
 
04:15:23.460 --> 04:15:23.750 align:start position:0%
Scout project went to various local
um

04:15:23.750 --> 04:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:23.760 --> 04:15:25.389 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

04:15:25.389 --> 04:15:25.399 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:15:29.870 --> 04:15:29.880 align:start position:0%
drug stores and ask to set up a box that
 
04:15:31.849 --> 04:15:31.859 align:start position:0%
asks people to buy these products and
 
04:15:33.469 --> 04:15:33.479 align:start position:0%
put them in the box and then they could
 
04:15:35.750 --> 04:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
be distributed from there and that was
 
04:15:38.090 --> 04:15:38.100 align:start position:0%
something she did on her own and
 
04:15:40.610 --> 04:15:40.620 align:start position:0%
collected quite a few feminine hygiene
 
04:15:44.510 --> 04:15:44.520 align:start position:0%
projects products to be given to girls
 
04:15:48.229 --> 04:15:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:50.210 --> 04:15:50.220 align:start position:0%
representative Mullen
 
04:15:52.610 --> 04:15:52.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
04:15:52.620 --> 04:15:53.269 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

04:15:53.269 --> 04:15:53.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:56.570 --> 04:15:56.580 align:start position:0%
yes to many of the comments that have
 
04:15:58.729 --> 04:15:58.739 align:start position:0%
been made one thing that we have not
 
04:16:00.530 --> 04:16:00.540 align:start position:0%
addressed to this point is the fact that
 
04:16:04.610 --> 04:16:04.620 align:start position:0%
the current statute has uh within it
 
04:16:07.309 --> 04:16:07.319 align:start position:0%
guidance for school districts to seek
 
04:16:09.290 --> 04:16:09.300 align:start position:0%
Partnerships from non-profit
 
04:16:13.910 --> 04:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
organizations or uh it says
 
04:16:16.250 --> 04:16:16.260 align:start position:0%
a school district May seek grants or
 
04:16:17.630 --> 04:16:17.640 align:start position:0%
partner with a non-profit or
 
04:16:19.729 --> 04:16:19.739 align:start position:0%
community-based organization to fulfill
 
04:16:21.309 --> 04:16:21.319 align:start position:0%
their obligation
 
04:16:21.319 --> 04:16:23.030 align:start position:0%
their obligation
so

04:16:23.030 --> 04:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:16:25.429 --> 04:16:25.439 align:start position:0%
um there is nothing that precludes
 
04:16:29.090 --> 04:16:29.100 align:start position:0%
school districts right now from seeking
 
04:16:31.189 --> 04:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
out assistance from non-profit
 
04:16:34.150 --> 04:16:34.160 align:start position:0%
organizations to cover the costs of this
 
04:16:38.630 --> 04:16:38.640 align:start position:0%
without taking away the obligation that
 
04:16:40.429 --> 04:16:40.439 align:start position:0%
the district has to make sure that the
 
04:16:42.050 --> 04:16:42.060 align:start position:0%
product is provided
 
04:16:44.330 --> 04:16:44.340 align:start position:0%
and the second thing is you know I'm
 
04:16:46.429 --> 04:16:46.439 align:start position:0%
sure the governor's office heard all of
 
04:16:49.010 --> 04:16:49.020 align:start position:0%
these arguments prior to his signing
 
04:16:51.830 --> 04:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
this into law but he chose to sign it
 
04:16:54.590 --> 04:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
into law anyhow and then there was a
 
04:16:57.530 --> 04:16:57.540 align:start position:0%
great deal of positive feedback both uh
 
04:17:00.650 --> 04:17:00.660 align:start position:0%
in the media and in the halls of the
 
04:17:03.349 --> 04:17:03.359 align:start position:0%
legislature about what a wonderful thing
 
04:17:06.950 --> 04:17:06.960 align:start position:0%
this was to recognize people that were
 
04:17:10.010 --> 04:17:10.020 align:start position:0%
unable to provide their own product and
 
04:17:12.170 --> 04:17:12.180 align:start position:0%
to partner with the schools so I would
 
04:17:14.870 --> 04:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
encourage people to vote against this
 
04:17:19.189 --> 04:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
bill and to not take away from a
 
04:17:21.650 --> 04:17:21.660 align:start position:0%
vulnerable population something that is
 
04:17:25.969 --> 04:17:25.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:28.849 --> 04:17:28.859 align:start position:0%
thank you representative thank you Mr
 
04:17:31.570 --> 04:17:31.580 align:start position:0%
chair I just want to address one issue
 
04:17:35.990 --> 04:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
and that's the 28a issue this is a bogus
 
04:17:36.000 --> 04:17:37.610 align:start position:0%
and that's the 28a issue this is a bogus
argument

04:17:37.610 --> 04:17:37.620 align:start position:0%
argument
 
04:17:40.790 --> 04:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
the state underfunds many things here
 
04:17:43.370 --> 04:17:43.380 align:start position:0%
let's take state standards for example
 
04:17:45.650 --> 04:17:45.660 align:start position:0%
let's take State funding to schools
 
04:17:48.889 --> 04:17:48.899 align:start position:0%
let's talk about cuts and budgets that
 
04:17:52.010 --> 04:17:52.020 align:start position:0%
have to then be picked up by local disk
 
04:17:54.110 --> 04:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
school districts I don't hear anyone
 
04:17:57.290 --> 04:17:57.300 align:start position:0%
talking about a 28 a issue when those
 
04:17:59.450 --> 04:17:59.460 align:start position:0%
come about but now when we deal with
 
04:18:02.210 --> 04:18:02.220 align:start position:0%
this specific thing we say oh it's a 21
 
04:18:06.590 --> 04:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
it's a 28a issue it's not an argument
 
04:18:08.750 --> 04:18:08.760 align:start position:0%
there are greater issues that this state
 
04:18:12.590 --> 04:18:12.600 align:start position:0%
does not fund that are 28a issues this
 
04:18:16.790 --> 04:18:16.800 align:start position:0%
clearly does not fall into that category
 
04:18:21.590 --> 04:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative uh Tanner
 
04:18:23.650 --> 04:18:23.660 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
04:18:27.110 --> 04:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
I don't know if uh I heard uh
 
04:18:28.910 --> 04:18:28.920 align:start position:0%
representative lake is correctly or not
 
04:18:32.990 --> 04:18:33.000 align:start position:0%
but toilet paper is not a an option uh
 
04:18:36.229 --> 04:18:36.239 align:start position:0%
in schools uh I know of no school where
 
04:18:39.950 --> 04:18:39.960 align:start position:0%
you have to bring your own toilet paper
 
04:18:39.960 --> 04:18:40.670 align:start position:0%
you have to bring your own toilet paper
um

04:18:40.670 --> 04:18:40.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:18:43.490 --> 04:18:43.500 align:start position:0%
so that that was one issue the other
 
04:18:46.250 --> 04:18:46.260 align:start position:0%
thing is uh with the 28a since that
 
04:18:48.710 --> 04:18:48.720 align:start position:0%
seems to be the focus is that the
 
04:18:51.469 --> 04:18:51.479 align:start position:0%
lawsuit that representative Woodcock was
 
04:18:55.130 --> 04:18:55.140 align:start position:0%
talking about was actually over the
 
04:18:58.490 --> 04:18:58.500 align:start position:0%
state retirement responsibility when the
 
04:19:01.670 --> 04:19:01.680 align:start position:0%
state who had put the retirement system
 
04:19:05.990 --> 04:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
in into order uh suddenly decided it
 
04:19:07.610 --> 04:19:07.620 align:start position:0%
wasn't going to pay for it and
 
04:19:09.410 --> 04:19:09.420 align:start position:0%
downshifted that cost to the local
 
04:19:09.420 --> 04:19:10.750 align:start position:0%
downshifted that cost to the local
schools

04:19:10.750 --> 04:19:10.760 align:start position:0%
schools
 
04:19:14.630 --> 04:19:14.640 align:start position:0%
uh a tremendous up increase in their
 
04:19:17.450 --> 04:19:17.460 align:start position:0%
taxes local taxes
 
04:19:21.050 --> 04:19:21.060 align:start position:0%
the that was taken to court as a 28-a
 
04:19:24.170 --> 04:19:24.180 align:start position:0%
issue and that with that tremendous
 
04:19:26.090 --> 04:19:26.100 align:start position:0%
Financial increase
 
04:19:28.189 --> 04:19:28.199 align:start position:0%
was ruled by the court
 
04:19:31.250 --> 04:19:31.260 align:start position:0%
as not a 28 a issue
 
04:19:34.490 --> 04:19:34.500 align:start position:0%
and it was ruled as as not a 28-a issue
 
04:19:36.110 --> 04:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
because it was part of the financial
 
04:19:38.570 --> 04:19:38.580 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the school
 
04:19:40.910 --> 04:19:40.920 align:start position:0%
and if toilet paper is a financial
 
04:19:43.010 --> 04:19:43.020 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the school
 
04:19:45.650 --> 04:19:45.660 align:start position:0%
and paper towels or some way to dry your
 
04:19:47.689 --> 04:19:47.699 align:start position:0%
hands is a responsibility of the school
 
04:19:51.170 --> 04:19:51.180 align:start position:0%
and to actually have bathroom facilities
 
04:19:52.910 --> 04:19:52.920 align:start position:0%
in a school
 
04:19:57.530 --> 04:19:57.540 align:start position:0%
then I think it's just uh it's not a 28a
 
04:20:00.950 --> 04:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
um issue to include feminine hygiene
 
04:20:04.309 --> 04:20:04.319 align:start position:0%
products as well and I totally agree
 
04:20:04.319 --> 04:20:05.150 align:start position:0%
products as well and I totally agree
with

04:20:05.150 --> 04:20:05.160 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:20:08.030 --> 04:20:08.040 align:start position:0%
representative Allard that
 
04:20:10.910 --> 04:20:10.920 align:start position:0%
schools that are really hurting
 
04:20:12.650 --> 04:20:12.660 align:start position:0%
you know this is the school funding
 
04:20:15.410 --> 04:20:15.420 align:start position:0%
issue schools that are really hurting
 
04:20:18.290 --> 04:20:18.300 align:start position:0%
like his school like Newport my district
 
04:20:21.710 --> 04:20:21.720 align:start position:0%
like Claremont you know four thousand
 
04:20:23.269 --> 04:20:23.279 align:start position:0%
dollars is a big deal
 
04:20:25.610 --> 04:20:25.620 align:start position:0%
and we really need to solve the school
 
04:20:28.070 --> 04:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
funding issue so we're not fighting over
 
04:20:30.889 --> 04:20:30.899 align:start position:0%
menstrual products as breaking the
 
04:20:32.929 --> 04:20:32.939 align:start position:0%
budget thank you
 
04:20:35.689 --> 04:20:35.699 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
04:20:35.699 --> 04:20:40.090 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
representative

04:20:40.090 --> 04:20:40.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:43.250 --> 04:20:43.260 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair and I think
 
04:20:45.830 --> 04:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
what representative Tanner and others
 
04:20:48.110 --> 04:20:48.120 align:start position:0%
have said is uh is is really important
 
04:20:50.510 --> 04:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
with with um particularly with respect
 
04:20:54.769 --> 04:20:54.779 align:start position:0%
to to 28a uh representative Tanner is is
 
04:20:57.290 --> 04:20:57.300 align:start position:0%
absolutely right you can't just sort of
 
04:21:00.170 --> 04:21:00.180 align:start position:0%
pick and choose how you want to use it
 
04:21:02.150 --> 04:21:02.160 align:start position:0%
um because the Supreme Court's already
 
04:21:05.630 --> 04:21:05.640 align:start position:0%
told us how uh how to use it and and the
 
04:21:08.269 --> 04:21:08.279 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court's on the record in the uh
 
04:21:10.790 --> 04:21:10.800 align:start position:0%
in the New Hampshire retirement system
 
04:21:14.150 --> 04:21:14.160 align:start position:0%
um case of of those downshifts to our
 
04:21:15.950 --> 04:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
school districts that has to be
 
04:21:17.809 --> 04:21:17.819 align:start position:0%
something more than merely a financial
 
04:21:21.969 --> 04:21:21.979 align:start position:0%
obligation and I'd say the um the 35
 
04:21:24.410 --> 04:21:24.420 align:start position:0%
downshift which represents something in
 
04:21:27.349 --> 04:21:27.359 align:start position:0%
the amount of 40 50 million dollars a
 
04:21:29.870 --> 04:21:29.880 align:start position:0%
year Statewide to school districts is
 
04:21:31.969 --> 04:21:31.979 align:start position:0%
more than merely a financial obligation
 
04:21:35.150 --> 04:21:35.160 align:start position:0%
but in fact the court said that that's
 
04:21:37.670 --> 04:21:37.680 align:start position:0%
merely a financial obligation and it
 
04:21:40.189 --> 04:21:40.199 align:start position:0%
said that that the state State action
 
04:21:42.170 --> 04:21:42.180 align:start position:0%
must impose some and I'm reading from
 
04:21:44.689 --> 04:21:44.699 align:start position:0%
the decision some substantive change to
 
04:21:47.050 --> 04:21:47.060 align:start position:0%
the underlying function Duty or activity
 
04:21:49.849 --> 04:21:49.859 align:start position:0%
performed or to be performed by local
 
04:21:51.650 --> 04:21:51.660 align:start position:0%
government and clearly we're providing
 
04:21:54.050 --> 04:21:54.060 align:start position:0%
sanitary type products
 
04:21:56.210 --> 04:21:56.220 align:start position:0%
um at the um at the school districts in
 
04:22:00.050 --> 04:22:00.060 align:start position:0%
a lot of different ways so so 28a just
 
04:22:02.269 --> 04:22:02.279 align:start position:0%
clearly doesn't apply you can't pick and
 
04:22:06.050 --> 04:22:06.060 align:start position:0%
choose but um but but I think the the
 
04:22:08.389 --> 04:22:08.399 align:start position:0%
bigger point that that Linda was making
 
04:22:11.030 --> 04:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
and others is that how we fund our
 
04:22:16.010 --> 04:22:16.020 align:start position:0%
schools is is is is is also at um you
 
04:22:18.889 --> 04:22:18.899 align:start position:0%
know is is also part of this and and
 
04:22:21.530 --> 04:22:21.540 align:start position:0%
where we're starving our schools in
 
04:22:23.450 --> 04:22:23.460 align:start position:0%
terms of in terms of
 
04:22:25.550 --> 04:22:25.560 align:start position:0%
um financial support to a point where
 
04:22:27.110 --> 04:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
where they need to
 
04:22:29.870 --> 04:22:29.880 align:start position:0%
um they need to roll back things like
 
04:22:32.750 --> 04:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
providing providing um hygiene products
 
04:22:36.050 --> 04:22:36.060 align:start position:0%
I think is is is just a really sort of
 
04:22:38.929 --> 04:22:38.939 align:start position:0%
pathetic state of State of Affairs but
 
04:22:41.689 --> 04:22:41.699 align:start position:0%
finally Mr chair I just want to I I want
 
04:22:44.630 --> 04:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
to sort of put out a practical
 
04:22:44.640 --> 04:22:45.410 align:start position:0%
to sort of put out a practical
um

04:22:45.410 --> 04:22:45.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:48.050 --> 04:22:48.060 align:start position:0%
um issue uh also with respect to school
 
04:22:51.290 --> 04:22:51.300 align:start position:0%
funding and uh and period poverty I
 
04:22:52.969 --> 04:22:52.979 align:start position:0%
believe it was either on this bill or a
 
04:22:55.010 --> 04:22:55.020 align:start position:0%
related bill that we heard that some
 
04:22:57.410 --> 04:22:57.420 align:start position:0%
girls Miss as many as 40 days
 
04:23:01.070 --> 04:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
out of 180 days of of school every year
 
04:23:04.250 --> 04:23:04.260 align:start position:0%
and and for for anybody
 
04:23:07.610 --> 04:23:07.620 align:start position:0%
um uh who who who you know thinks how
 
04:23:10.010 --> 04:23:10.020 align:start position:0%
important it is to to go to school I
 
04:23:10.020 --> 04:23:10.670 align:start position:0%
important it is to to go to school I
mean

04:23:10.670 --> 04:23:10.680 align:start position:0%
mean
 
04:23:14.090 --> 04:23:14.100 align:start position:0%
um you know time is the currency of
 
04:23:17.510 --> 04:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
public education so missing 40 days is
 
04:23:21.110 --> 04:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
is a crime uh right there uh and we can
 
04:23:24.410 --> 04:23:24.420 align:start position:0%
we can stop it but more importantly more
 
04:23:24.420 --> 04:23:25.790 align:start position:0%
we can stop it but more importantly more
importantly

04:23:25.790 --> 04:23:25.800 align:start position:0%
importantly
 
04:23:29.030 --> 04:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
um those 40 days also represent it's
 
04:23:30.650 --> 04:23:30.660 align:start position:0%
about 22 percent of the school year
 
04:23:34.610 --> 04:23:34.620 align:start position:0%
that's also 22 percent of of one
 
04:23:37.790 --> 04:23:37.800 align:start position:0%
full-time equivalent towards an adma and
 
04:23:39.889 --> 04:23:39.899 align:start position:0%
every adma we know through the school
 
04:23:41.530 --> 04:23:41.540 align:start position:0%
funding formula
 
04:23:47.229 --> 04:23:47.239 align:start position:0%
is um um helps bring in the base of
 
04:23:51.710 --> 04:23:51.720 align:start position:0%
3709 3700 dollars plus differentiated
 
04:23:55.070 --> 04:23:55.080 align:start position:0%
Aid and all together you know on average
 
04:23:57.830 --> 04:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
it may be about five thousand dollars so
 
04:24:01.309 --> 04:24:01.319 align:start position:0%
22 percent of that is a thousand bucks
 
04:24:03.590 --> 04:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
um so from a practical standpoint not
 
04:24:06.530 --> 04:24:06.540 align:start position:0%
only can we help close the opportunity
 
04:24:09.429 --> 04:24:09.439 align:start position:0%
gap for students that come from
 
04:24:11.929 --> 04:24:11.939 align:start position:0%
low-income families that can't afford
 
04:24:14.750 --> 04:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
these products we can provide them uh
 
04:24:16.490 --> 04:24:16.500 align:start position:0%
what they need so that they can attend
 
04:24:18.830 --> 04:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
the full 180 days they're certainly not
 
04:24:21.590 --> 04:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
miss 40 of it associated with with their
 
04:24:23.090 --> 04:24:23.100 align:start position:0%
time of the month
 
04:24:25.070 --> 04:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
um but also the school district will
 
04:24:27.170 --> 04:24:27.180 align:start position:0%
receive an additional thousand dollars
 
04:24:28.309 --> 04:24:28.319 align:start position:0%
at least
 
04:24:30.650 --> 04:24:30.660 align:start position:0%
from the um from the state adequacy
 
04:24:33.830 --> 04:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
Grant so all in all I think this is this
 
04:24:36.290 --> 04:24:36.300 align:start position:0%
is a plus for kids it's a plus for
 
04:24:38.689 --> 04:24:38.699 align:start position:0%
school funding and um and it's a plus
 
04:24:38.699 --> 04:24:39.590 align:start position:0%
school funding and um and it's a plus
for

04:24:39.590 --> 04:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:24:41.689 --> 04:24:41.699 align:start position:0%
um for all of us you know in the state
 
04:24:45.410 --> 04:24:45.420 align:start position:0%
to have um to have our kids uh receive
 
04:24:48.349 --> 04:24:48.359 align:start position:0%
um a quality educational outcome thank
 
04:24:51.110 --> 04:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much now we're we've
 
04:24:53.030 --> 04:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
been debating now for about 45 minutes
 
04:24:56.210 --> 04:24:56.220 align:start position:0%
on this bill and what I'm going to allow
 
04:24:57.950 --> 04:24:57.960 align:start position:0%
is that representative Woodcock do you
 
04:25:00.229 --> 04:25:00.239 align:start position:0%
have your hand up and representative of
 
04:25:03.410 --> 04:25:03.420 align:start position:0%
yours both of you have spoken before
 
04:25:05.870 --> 04:25:05.880 align:start position:0%
um so go ahead and speak now but I'd
 
04:25:08.210 --> 04:25:08.220 align:start position:0%
like to close this down uh shortly
 
04:25:08.220 --> 04:25:10.070 align:start position:0%
like to close this down uh shortly
thereafter

04:25:10.070 --> 04:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
thereafter
 
04:25:12.130 --> 04:25:12.140 align:start position:0%
thank you representative I just want to
 
04:25:14.269 --> 04:25:14.279 align:start position:0%
rectify a couple things first off I want
 
04:25:15.469 --> 04:25:15.479 align:start position:0%
to thank the
 
04:25:17.870 --> 04:25:17.880 align:start position:0%
good representative from Pittsfield
 
04:25:20.150 --> 04:25:20.160 align:start position:0%
um I don't know how many others of you
 
04:25:23.090 --> 04:25:23.100 align:start position:0%
around the board on zoom and or at the
 
04:25:25.550 --> 04:25:25.560 align:start position:0%
room actually called or went to your
 
04:25:27.229 --> 04:25:27.239 align:start position:0%
public schools and asked how the program
 
04:25:28.729 --> 04:25:28.739 align:start position:0%
were working
 
04:25:30.349 --> 04:25:30.359 align:start position:0%
so I appreciate the represent reality
 
04:25:32.510 --> 04:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
took the initiative to do that and the
 
04:25:34.189 --> 04:25:34.199 align:start position:0%
creativity of his town using the food
 
04:25:36.290 --> 04:25:36.300 align:start position:0%
bank terrific
 
04:25:38.750 --> 04:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
um and I understand the lack of funny
 
04:25:40.250 --> 04:25:40.260 align:start position:0%
and small schools
 
04:25:42.950 --> 04:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
and there was there was a thought maybe
 
04:25:46.429 --> 04:25:46.439 align:start position:0%
we should go to our schools and uh
 
04:25:49.370 --> 04:25:49.380 align:start position:0%
advocate for this in a regular basis I'm
 
04:25:53.330 --> 04:25:53.340 align:start position:0%
happy to say that uh Conway and sau9 was
 
04:25:55.010 --> 04:25:55.020 align:start position:0%
the head of the game before this bill
 
04:25:57.710 --> 04:25:57.720 align:start position:0%
even came to the house two years ago
 
04:25:59.510 --> 04:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
we've been doing that because we've had
 
04:26:02.389 --> 04:26:02.399 align:start position:0%
the need and the awareness we've never
 
04:26:03.830 --> 04:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
had any problems with things being
 
04:26:06.950 --> 04:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
stolen tipped over or uh you know used
 
04:26:06.960 --> 04:26:08.389 align:start position:0%
stolen tipped over or uh you know used
inappropriately

04:26:08.389 --> 04:26:08.399 align:start position:0%
inappropriately
 
04:26:10.370 --> 04:26:10.380 align:start position:0%
so I just want to clarify those things
 
04:26:12.050 --> 04:26:12.060 align:start position:0%
and ask yourselves if you're a
 
04:26:14.090 --> 04:26:14.100 align:start position:0%
legislator did you even bother calling
 
04:26:15.349 --> 04:26:15.359 align:start position:0%
your school to see how many kids
 
04:26:16.910 --> 04:26:16.920 align:start position:0%
actually taking advantage of this
 
04:26:19.429 --> 04:26:19.439 align:start position:0%
actually are in school
 
04:26:22.130 --> 04:26:22.140 align:start position:0%
um because of this uh and I was
 
04:26:24.170 --> 04:26:24.180 align:start position:0%
reiterate the one thing I started with
 
04:26:27.469 --> 04:26:27.479 align:start position:0%
30 days a year times six years there's
 
04:26:30.769 --> 04:26:30.779 align:start position:0%
180 days of school these youngsters Miss
 
04:26:34.070 --> 04:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
not not counting reteaching this is the
 
04:26:36.830 --> 04:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
case of haves and have-nots it's a
 
04:26:39.110 --> 04:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
perfect time to help the help to keep
 
04:26:41.389 --> 04:26:41.399 align:start position:0%
students in school and help education
 
04:26:43.010 --> 04:26:43.020 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate the second opportunity
 
04:26:45.530 --> 04:26:45.540 align:start position:0%
representative I had to speak thank you
 
04:26:47.450 --> 04:26:47.460 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
04:26:51.349 --> 04:26:51.359 align:start position:0%
that's regarding 28a if the schools
 
04:26:53.149 --> 04:26:53.159 align:start position:0%
which they don't if the state I mean
 
04:26:56.030 --> 04:26:56.040 align:start position:0%
which it doesn't require schools to
 
04:26:58.550 --> 04:26:58.560 align:start position:0%
provide toilet paper and paper towels in
 
04:26:59.929 --> 04:26:59.939 align:start position:0%
the bathrooms
 
04:27:03.830 --> 04:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
this would not be a 28-day violation to
 
04:27:06.769 --> 04:27:06.779 align:start position:0%
extend it but we don't require that
 
04:27:09.410 --> 04:27:09.420 align:start position:0%
schools provided and that's all I'm
 
04:27:12.290 --> 04:27:12.300 align:start position:0%
saying is schools can provide this just
 
04:27:14.210 --> 04:27:14.220 align:start position:0%
like I'm not saying don't provide those
 
04:27:16.189 --> 04:27:16.199 align:start position:0%
things where schools don't have to I'm
 
04:27:18.950 --> 04:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
saying schools choose to and schools can
 
04:27:21.290 --> 04:27:21.300 align:start position:0%
choose to provide this so that's number
 
04:27:24.290 --> 04:27:24.300 align:start position:0%
one why it is a 28-day violation because
 
04:27:28.309 --> 04:27:28.319 align:start position:0%
we don't mandate those things so it is a
 
04:27:30.950 --> 04:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
new thing that we are mandating that we
 
04:27:33.290 --> 04:27:33.300 align:start position:0%
did not mandate before but the other
 
04:27:35.630 --> 04:27:35.640 align:start position:0%
point that I want to make is everybody's
 
04:27:37.550 --> 04:27:37.560 align:start position:0%
talking about the money and how much it
 
04:27:41.389 --> 04:27:41.399 align:start position:0%
costs and rep Ballard did and I also I
 
04:27:42.830 --> 04:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
went and talked to my school district
 
04:27:45.050 --> 04:27:45.060 align:start position:0%
because I was curious
 
04:27:47.809 --> 04:27:47.819 align:start position:0%
um how it happened but rep Ballard was
 
04:27:49.490 --> 04:27:49.500 align:start position:0%
talking about the things that his school
 
04:27:52.130 --> 04:27:52.140 align:start position:0%
did the thing is this original Bill did
 
04:27:53.929 --> 04:27:53.939 align:start position:0%
not provide any money
 
04:27:56.689 --> 04:27:56.699 align:start position:0%
so it's not like oh well now we're going
 
04:27:58.729 --> 04:27:58.739 align:start position:0%
to have if we take this away we won't
 
04:28:00.950 --> 04:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
have this money or whatever we don't
 
04:28:02.330 --> 04:28:02.340 align:start position:0%
have it now
 
04:28:04.550 --> 04:28:04.560 align:start position:0%
the money was never provided to begin
 
04:28:06.950 --> 04:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
with so all we're saying is
 
04:28:08.929 --> 04:28:08.939 align:start position:0%
we're making the school spend money
 
04:28:10.849 --> 04:28:10.859 align:start position:0%
we're not giving them any money for it
 
04:28:13.790 --> 04:28:13.800 align:start position:0%
so let's let them make their own choice
 
04:28:15.229 --> 04:28:15.239 align:start position:0%
and figure out how they're going to do
 
04:28:19.130 --> 04:28:19.140 align:start position:0%
it like uh rep allards District did I
 
04:28:20.570 --> 04:28:20.580 align:start position:0%
think that was a wonderful solution they
 
04:28:23.330 --> 04:28:23.340 align:start position:0%
came to It's Perfectly allowable and
 
04:28:25.490 --> 04:28:25.500 align:start position:0%
reasonable and they can continue to do
 
04:28:27.710 --> 04:28:27.720 align:start position:0%
it whether or not they're mandated to
 
04:28:29.870 --> 04:28:29.880 align:start position:0%
and if you think your school district
 
04:28:32.090 --> 04:28:32.100 align:start position:0%
will decide not to do it Go convince
 
04:28:34.010 --> 04:28:34.020 align:start position:0%
them to do it and if you think your
 
04:28:35.990 --> 04:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
school district doesn't have money give
 
04:28:37.849 --> 04:28:37.859 align:start position:0%
the uh give the
 
04:28:40.250 --> 04:28:40.260 align:start position:0%
um example of re Ballard and his
 
04:28:42.110 --> 04:28:42.120 align:start position:0%
district and what they did and
 
04:28:43.729 --> 04:28:43.739 align:start position:0%
encouraged the school to continue
 
04:28:46.370 --> 04:28:46.380 align:start position:0%
providing these things but we shouldn't
 
04:28:49.630 --> 04:28:49.640 align:start position:0%
be mandating it that's all this is about
 
04:28:51.349 --> 04:28:51.359 align:start position:0%

perhaps on woodcock
 
04:31:43.790 --> 04:31:43.800 align:start position:0%
I'm looking I'm not going to start all
 
04:31:45.710 --> 04:31:45.720 align:start position:0%
over again is beating a dead horse or a
 
04:31:48.290 --> 04:31:48.300 align:start position:0%
phony around here somewhere but my
 
04:31:51.050 --> 04:31:51.060 align:start position:0%
question is if if we have
 
04:31:57.590 --> 04:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
um two 276 uh and 458 just past 11 to 9.
 
04:31:59.929 --> 04:31:59.939 align:start position:0%
why why would a retain why would we
 
04:32:02.990 --> 04:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
retain 276 which is a almost a
 
04:32:04.849 --> 04:32:04.859 align:start position:0%
duplication Bill one's bad and one's
 
04:32:06.950 --> 04:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
worst why why are we retaining a
 
04:32:10.070 --> 04:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
duplication Bill why do we just itl
 
04:32:12.649 --> 04:32:12.659 align:start position:0%
sir further discussion I mean that's a
 
04:32:13.910 --> 04:32:13.920 align:start position:0%
quick that's a question representative
 
04:32:16.010 --> 04:32:16.020 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to find out is chair why
 
04:32:19.790 --> 04:32:19.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:23.269 --> 04:32:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:25.490 --> 04:32:25.500 align:start position:0%
like this
 
04:32:27.590 --> 04:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
um they are different this one says the
 
04:32:29.389 --> 04:32:29.399 align:start position:0%
state provides the money a number of
 
04:32:29.399 --> 04:32:30.830 align:start position:0%
state provides the money a number of
people

04:32:30.830 --> 04:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:32:30.840 --> 04:32:31.490 align:start position:0%
people
um

04:32:31.490 --> 04:32:31.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:32:34.550 --> 04:32:34.560 align:start position:0%
said if we thought this was valuable we
 
04:32:36.969 --> 04:32:36.979 align:start position:0%
should have the state provide the money
 
04:32:42.849 --> 04:32:42.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:46.389 --> 04:32:46.399 align:start position:0%
I want to see what the house in general
 
04:32:49.070 --> 04:32:49.080 align:start position:0%
thinks about this whole thing if they
 
04:32:50.870 --> 04:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
say yeah we should just get rid of it
 
04:32:52.729 --> 04:32:52.739 align:start position:0%
cool if they say
 
04:32:55.250 --> 04:32:55.260 align:start position:0%
no we shouldn't just get rid of it then
 
04:32:57.649 --> 04:32:57.659 align:start position:0%
this allows us to still
 
04:33:00.349 --> 04:33:00.359 align:start position:0%
instead of just
 
04:33:00.359 --> 04:33:01.130 align:start position:0%
instead of just
um

04:33:01.130 --> 04:33:01.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:03.229 --> 04:33:03.239 align:start position:0%
not being able to bring this up at all
 
04:33:06.949 --> 04:33:06.959 align:start position:0%
we have this retained to say okay you
 
04:33:08.269 --> 04:33:08.279 align:start position:0%
don't want to get rid of it do you want
 
04:33:11.449 --> 04:33:11.459 align:start position:0%
to do this instead that's that's why
 
04:33:17.010 --> 04:33:17.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:17.020 --> 04:33:18.529 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:33:18.529 --> 04:33:18.539 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:33:21.230 --> 04:33:21.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair for uh addressing me
 
04:33:22.670 --> 04:33:22.680 align:start position:0%
so quickly
 
04:33:26.090 --> 04:33:26.100 align:start position:0%
um a question about how a district would
 
04:33:29.750 --> 04:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
go about seeking reimbursement
 
04:33:34.849 --> 04:33:34.859 align:start position:0%
I mean is there a process in place or uh
 
04:33:37.250 --> 04:33:37.260 align:start position:0%
what would a new process have to be
 
04:33:37.260 --> 04:33:46.269 align:start position:0%
what would a new process have to be
created

04:33:46.269 --> 04:33:46.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:49.189 --> 04:33:49.199 align:start position:0%
yeah they probably would need to be all
 
04:33:51.051 --> 04:33:51.061 align:start position:0%
the more reason to retain it so we could
 
04:33:54.250 --> 04:33:54.260 align:start position:0%
figure that out if we need to okay
 
04:33:56.150 --> 04:33:56.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:33:56.160 --> 04:33:58.609 align:start position:0%

04:34:02.631 --> 04:34:02.641 align:start position:0%
to toilet paper now that we know that
 
04:34:05.631 --> 04:34:05.641 align:start position:0%
schools aren't required to supply toilet
 
04:34:05.641 --> 04:34:06.369 align:start position:0%
schools aren't required to supply toilet
paper

04:34:06.369 --> 04:34:06.379 align:start position:0%
paper
 
04:34:08.929 --> 04:34:08.939 align:start position:0%
the bill doesn't speak the toilet paper
 
04:34:10.910 --> 04:34:10.920 align:start position:0%
at all so uh
 
04:34:14.990 --> 04:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:19.150 --> 04:34:19.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:22.010 --> 04:34:22.020 align:start position:0%
okay if we have a motion on the table
 
04:34:25.631 --> 04:34:25.641 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:28.330 --> 04:34:28.340 align:start position:0%

um I recommend podcasts but with this
 
04:37:12.470 --> 04:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
amendment uh the amendment is uh zero
 
04:37:17.929 --> 04:37:17.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:21.410 --> 04:37:21.420 align:start position:0%

says it's relative to the study schools
 
04:37:27.650 --> 04:37:27.660 align:start position:0%
study funding commission domestic shell
 
04:37:32.150 --> 04:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
repeal upon the passage of of this uh
 
04:37:36.230 --> 04:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
of this bill is there a second or excuse
 
04:37:39.051 --> 04:37:39.061 align:start position:0%
me is there a second
 
04:37:40.429 --> 04:37:40.439 align:start position:0%
no second
 
04:37:50.769 --> 04:37:50.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:54.109 --> 04:37:54.119 align:start position:0%
but the commission study report was
 
04:37:57.230 --> 04:37:57.240 align:start position:0%
issued prior uh honor before January 10
 
04:37:57.240 --> 04:37:59.810 align:start position:0%
issued prior uh honor before January 10
2020

04:37:59.810 --> 04:37:59.820 align:start position:0%
2020
 
04:38:02.750 --> 04:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
um the initial report was submitted
 
04:38:04.910 --> 04:38:04.920 align:start position:0%
earlier than that
 
04:38:07.310 --> 04:38:07.320 align:start position:0%
um and then the current legislation
 
04:38:10.429 --> 04:38:10.439 align:start position:0%
indicated that the subsequent uh
 
04:38:12.949 --> 04:38:12.959 align:start position:0%
recommendation would be issue report
 
04:38:16.490 --> 04:38:16.500 align:start position:0%
that has been done by January 10th so at
 
04:38:18.470 --> 04:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
this point in time the final report has
 
04:38:21.051 --> 04:38:21.061 align:start position:0%
been issued and we've seen in the past
 
04:38:22.910 --> 04:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
were some of the commissions
 
04:38:26.689 --> 04:38:26.699 align:start position:0%
and just keep going on not not forever
 
04:38:26.699 --> 04:38:28.670 align:start position:0%
and just keep going on not not forever
um

04:38:28.670 --> 04:38:28.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:31.910 --> 04:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
Transmissions uh done its job and it's
 
04:38:34.970 --> 04:38:34.980 align:start position:0%
made its recommendations so the this
 
04:38:37.369 --> 04:38:37.379 align:start position:0%
this amendment simply states that the
 
04:38:40.490 --> 04:38:40.500 align:start position:0%
commission will cease pending passage of
 
04:38:41.869 --> 04:38:41.879 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:38:44.449 --> 04:38:44.459 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:46.730 --> 04:38:46.740 align:start position:0%
yeah uh thanks very much Mr chair I
 
04:38:48.709 --> 04:38:48.719 align:start position:0%
think representative Ladd
 
04:38:51.230 --> 04:38:51.240 align:start position:0%
um I got that pretty uh pretty much
 
04:38:52.849 --> 04:38:52.859 align:start position:0%
um you know we were both members of the
 
04:38:55.369 --> 04:38:55.379 align:start position:0%
commission uh during its uh during its
 
04:38:57.470 --> 04:38:57.480 align:start position:0%
active period uh in researching and
 
04:38:59.510 --> 04:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
developing uh the reports the report's
 
04:39:01.010 --> 04:39:01.020 align:start position:0%
been filed
 
04:39:02.390 --> 04:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
um there's certainly a lot more work to
 
04:39:04.310 --> 04:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
do when it comes to school funding but I
 
04:39:06.349 --> 04:39:06.359 align:start position:0%
think it moves beyond the commission uh
 
04:39:09.170 --> 04:39:09.180 align:start position:0%
at this point uh or has moved beyond the
 
04:39:11.650 --> 04:39:11.660 align:start position:0%
commission at this point into the
 
04:39:15.170 --> 04:39:15.180 align:start position:0%
legislative branch executive branch
 
04:39:18.349 --> 04:39:18.359 align:start position:0%
um and um and obviously Advocates too so
 
04:39:21.289 --> 04:39:21.299 align:start position:0%
um so uh uh commission members I'm sure
 
04:39:22.849 --> 04:39:22.859 align:start position:0%
will continue to be
 
04:39:26.869 --> 04:39:26.879 align:start position:0%
um vocal in in uh in in their um you
 
04:39:28.789 --> 04:39:28.799 align:start position:0%
know positions one way or the other when
 
04:39:31.010 --> 04:39:31.020 align:start position:0%
it comes to the findings or particularly
 
04:39:33.949 --> 04:39:33.959 align:start position:0%
recommendations but uh but but I think
 
04:39:36.890 --> 04:39:36.900 align:start position:0%
as far as procedural uh course goes this
 
04:39:39.230 --> 04:39:39.240 align:start position:0%
makes a lot of sense thanks
 
04:39:47.270 --> 04:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:52.250 --> 04:39:52.260 align:start position:0%

okay and I'd like to uh call rips at the
 
04:45:05.510 --> 04:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
latest for emotions
 
04:45:10.490 --> 04:45:10.500 align:start position:0%
yes I would like to move to itl
 
04:45:10.500 --> 04:45:11.570 align:start position:0%

HB 202. Jackson Hobson second
 
04:45:21.708 --> 04:45:21.718 align:start position:0%
um we have a motion for itl on 202 made
 
04:45:24.830 --> 04:45:24.840 align:start position:0%
by Professor Lakers and second by drips
 
04:45:27.410 --> 04:45:27.420 align:start position:0%
to Hobson representative would you like
 
04:45:29.510 --> 04:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
to speak to him motion yeah this bill
 
04:45:31.430 --> 04:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
sounded wonderful I thought it was a
 
04:45:33.708 --> 04:45:33.718 align:start position:0%
great idea I was planning on voting for
 
04:45:36.110 --> 04:45:36.120 align:start position:0%
it and then when we had public testimony
 
04:45:38.330 --> 04:45:38.340 align:start position:0%
which is the reason we have public
 
04:45:41.270 --> 04:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
testimony is that I then learned that it
 
04:45:43.250 --> 04:45:43.260 align:start position:0%
was unnecessary because it was already
 
04:45:46.810 --> 04:45:46.820 align:start position:0%
being done that there are we're already
 
04:45:52.070 --> 04:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
rsas covering this and that it says you
 
04:45:54.170 --> 04:45:54.180 align:start position:0%
know this is
 
04:45:56.090 --> 04:45:56.100 align:start position:0%
since it's already being done and
 
04:45:58.610 --> 04:45:58.620 align:start position:0%
whatever then we don't actually need
 
04:46:00.170 --> 04:46:00.180 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:46:02.330 --> 04:46:02.340 align:start position:0%
um I don't remember what the rsas were
 
04:46:04.430 --> 04:46:04.440 align:start position:0%
they break them down unfortunately for
 
04:46:06.350 --> 04:46:06.360 align:start position:0%
what covers this but
 
04:46:08.628 --> 04:46:08.638 align:start position:0%
having been told that there's no reason
 
04:46:12.170 --> 04:46:12.180 align:start position:0%
for us to do this one thank you
 
04:46:13.850 --> 04:46:13.860 align:start position:0%
with the second I'd like to speak to the
 
04:46:13.860 --> 04:46:15.110 align:start position:0%
with the second I'd like to speak to the
Village

04:46:15.110 --> 04:46:15.120 align:start position:0%
Village
 
04:46:17.270 --> 04:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
um no thank you uh just that we heard a
 
04:46:25.550 --> 04:46:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:29.510 --> 04:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:32.390 --> 04:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'll speak to this uh
 
04:46:36.230 --> 04:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
briefly uh yes we did hear testimony
 
04:46:38.390 --> 04:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
from uh Sherry white at the Department
 
04:46:44.948 --> 04:46:44.958 align:start position:0%
of Education it's RSA 189 11a and
 
04:46:49.730 --> 04:46:49.740 align:start position:0%
while it is true that we do have a meals
 
04:46:49.740 --> 04:46:50.948 align:start position:0%
while it is true that we do have a meals
program

04:46:50.948 --> 04:46:50.958 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:46:54.830 --> 04:46:54.840 align:start position:0%
that is in place for elementary schools
 
04:46:58.550 --> 04:46:58.560 align:start position:0%
it does not extend to uh middle and high
 
04:46:58.560 --> 04:46:59.570 align:start position:0%
it does not extend to uh middle and high
school

04:46:59.570 --> 04:46:59.580 align:start position:0%
school
 
04:47:04.550 --> 04:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
so uh the initial part of the bill which
 
04:47:07.788 --> 04:47:07.798 align:start position:0%
basically uh is that we will provide
 
04:47:11.030 --> 04:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
free meals to uh
 
04:47:15.590 --> 04:47:15.600 align:start position:0%
any student at school who is hungry who
 
04:47:19.250 --> 04:47:19.260 align:start position:0%
lacks the capacity to either clear their
 
04:47:21.948 --> 04:47:21.958 align:start position:0%
deficit balance or
 
04:47:24.970 --> 04:47:24.980 align:start position:0%
pay for a meal with cash
 
04:47:28.190 --> 04:47:28.200 align:start position:0%
that is the spirit of the law but that
 
04:47:32.510 --> 04:47:32.520 align:start position:0%
law does not apply to older children and
 
04:47:35.868 --> 04:47:35.878 align:start position:0%
uh I would venture a guess that our high
 
04:47:39.110 --> 04:47:39.120 align:start position:0%
school age kids are equally as hungry if
 
04:47:40.610 --> 04:47:40.620 align:start position:0%
not more
 
04:47:42.850 --> 04:47:42.860 align:start position:0%
than their Elementary
 
04:47:46.910 --> 04:47:46.920 align:start position:0%
counterparts so I would ask you to
 
04:47:49.910 --> 04:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
reconsider that aspect of us already
 
04:47:53.030 --> 04:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
doing things thank you thank you very
 
04:48:02.868 --> 04:48:02.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:04.970 --> 04:48:04.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
04:48:07.310 --> 04:48:07.320 align:start position:0%
um last session we passed this when it
 
04:48:10.550 --> 04:48:10.560 align:start position:0%
was House Bill 1127 it went to the house
 
04:48:14.330 --> 04:48:14.340 align:start position:0%
and we passed by a vote Voice vote
 
04:48:16.128 --> 04:48:16.138 align:start position:0%
um and it's one of the bills that died
 
04:48:18.590 --> 04:48:18.600 align:start position:0%
along with covid when we had too many
 
04:48:18.600 --> 04:48:20.030 align:start position:0%
along with covid when we had too many
bills

04:48:20.030 --> 04:48:20.040 align:start position:0%
bills
 
04:48:22.490 --> 04:48:22.500 align:start position:0%
um and it had other things it does have
 
04:48:25.310 --> 04:48:25.320 align:start position:0%
other things in it like not um
 
04:48:27.948 --> 04:48:27.958 align:start position:0%
stigmatizing the child by handing him a
 
04:48:29.868 --> 04:48:29.878 align:start position:0%
note in front of everybody to bring home
 
04:48:32.990 --> 04:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
or you know offering them a lunch that's
 
04:48:35.330 --> 04:48:35.340 align:start position:0%
different than everybody else's like I
 
04:48:37.490 --> 04:48:37.500 align:start position:0%
can remember way back when when I worked
 
04:48:38.690 --> 04:48:38.700 align:start position:0%
at Parkside
 
04:48:41.270 --> 04:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
um they would be given a yogurt when
 
04:48:43.610 --> 04:48:43.620 align:start position:0%
everybody else was give being given a
 
04:48:45.830 --> 04:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
full meal so I think this bill is
 
04:48:45.840 --> 04:48:47.948 align:start position:0%
full meal so I think this bill is
necessary

04:48:47.948 --> 04:48:47.958 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
04:48:51.830 --> 04:48:51.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
04:48:54.530 --> 04:48:54.540 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair just a question
 
04:49:03.590 --> 04:49:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:07.310 --> 04:49:07.320 align:start position:0%
it is we shouldn't vote for it
 
04:49:09.530 --> 04:49:09.540 align:start position:0%
how long is I'm just asking because it's
 
04:49:12.288 --> 04:49:12.298 align:start position:0%
something we're currently doing and um
 
04:49:14.690 --> 04:49:14.700 align:start position:0%
trying to provide to all people in need
 
04:49:16.490 --> 04:49:16.500 align:start position:0%
to be like like other bills you may have
 
04:49:22.690 --> 04:49:22.700 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:27.050 --> 04:49:27.060 align:start position:0%
I believe that um Sherry white indicated
 
04:49:29.570 --> 04:49:29.580 align:start position:0%
that there was that was not happening
 
04:49:32.330 --> 04:49:32.340 align:start position:0%
currently she said that all students
 
04:49:35.448 --> 04:49:35.458 align:start position:0%
were getting the same lunches so
 
04:49:38.448 --> 04:49:38.458 align:start position:0%
um and I don't see any Precision in the
 
04:49:38.458 --> 04:49:39.470 align:start position:0%
um and I don't see any Precision in the
bill

04:49:39.470 --> 04:49:39.480 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:49:43.190 --> 04:49:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:45.948 --> 04:49:45.958 align:start position:0%
other than it it uh that's the
 
04:49:45.958 --> 04:49:47.868 align:start position:0%
other than it it uh that's the
stigmatization

04:49:47.868 --> 04:49:47.878 align:start position:0%
stigmatization
 
04:49:47.878 --> 04:49:49.850 align:start position:0%
stigmatization
um

04:49:49.850 --> 04:49:49.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:49:52.910 --> 04:49:52.920 align:start position:0%
that's the only thing that I think it
 
04:49:54.910 --> 04:49:54.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't say anything about a particular
 
04:49:58.430 --> 04:49:58.440 align:start position:0%
age group in the middle
 
04:50:00.830 --> 04:50:00.840 align:start position:0%
um unless I'm mistaken they've
 
04:50:00.840 --> 04:50:09.170 align:start position:0%
um unless I'm mistaken they've
representative

04:50:09.170 --> 04:50:09.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:11.330 --> 04:50:11.340 align:start position:0%
uh and the school board makes the
 
04:50:11.340 --> 04:50:12.590 align:start position:0%
uh and the school board makes the
decision

04:50:12.590 --> 04:50:12.600 align:start position:0%
decision
 
04:50:17.750 --> 04:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
um so so I I'm happy to listen to the
 
04:50:17.760 --> 04:50:18.948 align:start position:0%
um so so I I'm happy to listen to the
um

04:50:18.948 --> 04:50:18.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:50:21.708 --> 04:50:21.718 align:start position:0%
the debate on this but I just don't see
 
04:50:21.718 --> 04:50:22.910 align:start position:0%
the debate on this but I just don't see
it

04:50:22.910 --> 04:50:22.920 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:50:26.390 --> 04:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
with the way that kind of Technology
 
04:50:28.910 --> 04:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
can you give me the I apparently wrote
 
04:50:30.948 --> 04:50:30.958 align:start position:0%
down the wrong RSA can you give me the
 
04:50:34.850 --> 04:50:34.860 align:start position:0%
RSA again rep Nolan yes it's I'm looking
 
04:50:46.400 --> 04:50:46.410 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:46.410 --> 04:50:48.010 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:50:48.010 --> 04:50:48.020 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:50:51.050 --> 04:50:51.060 align:start position:0%
okay but it's going to take me a while
 
04:50:53.930 --> 04:50:53.940 align:start position:0%
to dig out uh the the comment that I was
 
04:50:53.940 --> 04:51:07.610 align:start position:0%
to dig out uh the the comment that I was
referencing

04:51:07.610 --> 04:51:07.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:09.890 --> 04:51:09.900 align:start position:0%
and that's also in uh
 
04:51:13.208 --> 04:51:13.218 align:start position:0%
education rules 306
 
04:51:17.810 --> 04:51:17.820 align:start position:0%
about 11 food nutrition services
 
04:51:20.030 --> 04:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
it deals with requiring that each School
 
04:51:21.830 --> 04:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
makes a meal available during school
 
04:51:23.270 --> 04:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
hours to every student under the
 
04:51:25.128 --> 04:51:25.138 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction you can't afford to it that
 
04:51:28.850 --> 04:51:28.860 align:start position:0%
our saving was just supported Roman 1
 
04:51:32.510 --> 04:51:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:34.670 --> 04:51:34.680 align:start position:0%
it's also my understanding that during
 
04:51:38.208 --> 04:51:38.218 align:start position:0%
this period of covet this has created a
 
04:51:41.868 --> 04:51:41.878 align:start position:0%
financial issue with schools where all
 
04:51:44.810 --> 04:51:44.820 align:start position:0%
students have been receiving meals at no
 
04:51:44.820 --> 04:51:45.770 align:start position:0%
students have been receiving meals at no
cost

04:51:45.770 --> 04:51:45.780 align:start position:0%
cost
 
04:51:49.250 --> 04:51:49.260 align:start position:0%
and that's impacting uh programs which
 
04:51:49.260 --> 04:51:50.330 align:start position:0%
and that's impacting uh programs which
we

04:51:50.330 --> 04:51:50.340 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:51:50.340 --> 04:51:52.070 align:start position:0%
we
generate

04:51:52.070 --> 04:51:52.080 align:start position:0%
generate
 
04:51:54.590 --> 04:51:54.600 align:start position:0%
um funding for for the students that do
 
04:51:58.250 --> 04:51:58.260 align:start position:0%
qualify based upon poverty and there's
 
04:51:59.448 --> 04:51:59.458 align:start position:0%
going to have to be some special
 
04:52:01.850 --> 04:52:01.860 align:start position:0%
assistance done for schools that are in
 
04:52:03.770 --> 04:52:03.780 align:start position:0%
this category so the funding will not
 
04:52:03.780 --> 04:52:05.510 align:start position:0%
this category so the funding will not
stop

04:52:05.510 --> 04:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
stop
 
04:52:07.730 --> 04:52:07.740 align:start position:0%
yeah so it represent them all in your
 
04:52:08.948 --> 04:52:08.958 align:start position:0%
hand is still up
 
04:52:12.770 --> 04:52:12.780 align:start position:0%
it is it's newly up uh in the handout
 
04:52:16.070 --> 04:52:16.080 align:start position:0%
that Ms White sent to us
 
04:52:18.350 --> 04:52:18.360 align:start position:0%
the section that is titled
 
04:52:20.810 --> 04:52:20.820 align:start position:0%
considerations for creating meal
 
04:52:24.070 --> 04:52:24.080 align:start position:0%

04:52:30.288 --> 04:52:30.298 align:start position:0%
according to FNS instructions revision
 
04:52:33.470 --> 04:52:33.480 align:start position:0%
two at the very least the alternate meal
 
04:52:37.128 --> 04:52:37.138 align:start position:0%
must always be offered to pre-primary
 
04:52:39.770 --> 04:52:39.780 align:start position:0%
and any child who has not entered the

04:52:50.930 --> 04:52:50.940 align:start position:0%
meal offered uh must conform to special
 
04:52:54.230 --> 04:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
dietary needs if applicable it does not
 
04:52:56.208 --> 04:52:56.218 align:start position:0%
mention middle school or high school
 
04:53:00.230 --> 04:53:00.240 align:start position:0%
students in that section it applies to
 
04:53:02.570 --> 04:53:02.580 align:start position:0%
pre-primary and elementary schools
 
04:53:07.430 --> 04:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:14.330 --> 04:53:14.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:18.288 --> 04:53:18.298 align:start position:0%
not see any I'm still not seeing
 
04:53:23.570 --> 04:53:23.580 align:start position:0%
um in reading all of 189 11a I'm not
 
04:53:29.090 --> 04:53:29.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:29.100 --> 04:53:31.910 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:53:31.910 --> 04:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:34.970 --> 04:53:34.980 align:start position:0%
I'm still not finding anything that says
 
04:53:37.128 --> 04:53:37.138 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't apply to all students in
 
04:53:39.670 --> 04:53:39.680 align:start position:0%
all schools
 
04:53:42.610 --> 04:53:42.620 align:start position:0%
two of the Department of Education
 
04:53:45.890 --> 04:53:45.900 align:start position:0%
technical advisory that Sherry white
 
04:53:49.970 --> 04:53:49.980 align:start position:0%
sent to us page two Under The Heading
 
04:53:52.190 --> 04:53:52.200 align:start position:0%
considerations for creating meal
 
04:53:55.970 --> 04:53:55.980 align:start position:0%
charging policies number three
 
04:53:59.030 --> 04:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
so I'm looking at the document that she
 
04:54:01.310 --> 04:54:01.320 align:start position:0%
sent us not part of the original Law is
 
04:54:03.410 --> 04:54:03.420 align:start position:0%
that what you're saying uh I don't it's
 
04:54:05.330 --> 04:54:05.340 align:start position:0%
the interpretation that the department
 
04:54:08.288 --> 04:54:08.298 align:start position:0%
of Ed sent to us
 
04:54:16.330 --> 04:54:16.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:20.090 --> 04:54:20.100 align:start position:0%
uh want to run two in front of me right
 
04:54:22.330 --> 04:54:22.340 align:start position:0%
now I do not
 
04:54:25.448 --> 04:54:25.458 align:start position:0%
because in that in the education rules
 
04:54:29.868 --> 04:54:29.878 align:start position:0%
it says exactly it says uh shall make a
 
04:54:31.730 --> 04:54:31.740 align:start position:0%
meal available during school hours to
 
04:54:34.128 --> 04:54:34.138 align:start position:0%
every student under its jurisdiction so
 
04:54:36.590 --> 04:54:36.600 align:start position:0%
the school has to provide to every
 
04:54:39.410 --> 04:54:39.420 align:start position:0%
student under his jurisdiction no I'm
 
04:54:41.030 --> 04:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
just asking does that applied just after
 
04:54:42.650 --> 04:54:42.660 align:start position:0%
elementary schools with middle schools
 
04:54:46.670 --> 04:54:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:50.628 --> 04:54:50.638 align:start position:0%
okay so noted yeah so I you know maybe
 
04:54:53.270 --> 04:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
we need to we need to you know figure it
 
04:54:57.050 --> 04:54:57.060 align:start position:0%
out here clarification Mr Mr chair can I
 
04:55:00.410 --> 04:55:00.420 align:start position:0%
make a point of order for a minute
 
04:55:03.050 --> 04:55:03.060 align:start position:0%
um the other years that I've served on
 
04:55:04.850 --> 04:55:04.860 align:start position:0%
the education committee
 
04:55:07.730 --> 04:55:07.740 align:start position:0%
we've received this booklet okay booklet
 
04:55:10.128 --> 04:55:10.138 align:start position:0%
on uh New Hampshire education laws
 
04:55:10.138 --> 04:55:11.770 align:start position:0%
on uh New Hampshire education laws
annotated

04:55:11.770 --> 04:55:11.780 align:start position:0%
annotated
 
04:55:14.810 --> 04:55:14.820 align:start position:0%
uh since representative Mullins been on
 
04:55:17.090 --> 04:55:17.100 align:start position:0%
the education committee we haven't been
 
04:55:20.090 --> 04:55:20.100 align:start position:0%
provided with that book and it makes a
 
04:55:21.470 --> 04:55:21.480 align:start position:0%
huge difference when you're talking
 
04:55:23.270 --> 04:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
about the issues that we're talking
 
04:55:26.150 --> 04:55:26.160 align:start position:0%
about right now to be able to have that
 
04:55:28.250 --> 04:55:28.260 align:start position:0%
book available and look it up
 
04:55:31.430 --> 04:55:31.440 align:start position:0%
um I'm looking it up from the 2018-19
 
04:55:33.708 --> 04:55:33.718 align:start position:0%
Edition I don't think there's been a
 
04:55:35.810 --> 04:55:35.820 align:start position:0%
whole lot of change since then but I
 
04:55:37.910 --> 04:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
think that should be made available to
 
04:55:40.670 --> 04:55:40.680 align:start position:0%
our committee members thank you that's
 
04:55:43.670 --> 04:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
in response to that as we call it the
 
04:55:45.110 --> 04:55:45.120 align:start position:0%
beginning when we started this we were
 
04:55:46.610 --> 04:55:46.620 align:start position:0%
told by Department of Education they're
 
04:55:50.330 --> 04:55:50.340 align:start position:0%
going to think a thumb drive with the
 
04:55:52.670 --> 04:55:52.680 align:start position:0%
statutes on that for each person we have
 
04:55:55.190 --> 04:55:55.200 align:start position:0%
not received it as of this point
 
04:55:58.490 --> 04:55:58.500 align:start position:0%
um and of course you can access all
 
04:56:00.410 --> 04:56:00.420 align:start position:0%
these statutes if you go to the general
 
04:56:02.690 --> 04:56:02.700 align:start position:0%
core website and look underneath uh
 
04:56:06.350 --> 04:56:06.360 align:start position:0%
state laws browse their search yep and
 
04:56:09.708 --> 04:56:09.718 align:start position:0%
it's it's not annotated though and the
 
04:56:12.230 --> 04:56:12.240 align:start position:0%
annotations make a a big deal of
 
04:56:15.288 --> 04:56:15.298 align:start position:0%
difference on some of the bills and it's
 
04:56:18.530 --> 04:56:18.540 align:start position:0%
not in paper some of us old folks
 
04:56:22.128 --> 04:56:22.138 align:start position:0%
uh need paper stuff and you can see that
 
04:56:24.288 --> 04:56:24.298 align:start position:0%
uh representative Mullen has spent money
 
04:56:26.448 --> 04:56:26.458 align:start position:0%
to run things off
 
04:56:28.070 --> 04:56:28.080 align:start position:0%
um and it's getting a little pricey at
 
04:56:37.250 --> 04:56:37.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:40.128 --> 04:56:40.138 align:start position:0%
um I actually have I do have a question
 
04:56:43.070 --> 04:56:43.080 align:start position:0%
so um I appreciate that book however
 
04:56:45.948 --> 04:56:45.958 align:start position:0%
that RSA that we've been quoted uh 189
 
04:56:49.490 --> 04:56:49.500 align:start position:0%
11a has been updated in 2019 and the
 
04:56:51.470 --> 04:56:51.480 align:start position:0%
advisory that we were sent was actually
 
04:56:55.670 --> 04:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
issued November 15 2016. so the statute
 
04:56:57.350 --> 04:56:57.360 align:start position:0%
that's referenced is actually more
 
04:57:00.530 --> 04:57:00.540 align:start position:0%
current than the advisory under um
 
04:57:03.230 --> 04:57:03.240 align:start position:0%
under uh
 
04:57:05.330 --> 04:57:05.340 align:start position:0%
Jefferson shop
 
04:57:08.690 --> 04:57:08.700 align:start position:0%
from what she read from that uh I know
 
04:57:11.330 --> 04:57:11.340 align:start position:0%
exactly what uh representative Mullen
 
04:57:13.670 --> 04:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
had in her hands because it was sent to
 
04:57:16.970 --> 04:57:16.980 align:start position:0%
all of us from uh Sherry I didn't print
 
04:57:23.090 --> 04:57:23.100 align:start position:0%
it out but that clearly does not State
 
04:57:23.100 --> 04:57:23.628 align:start position:0%
it out but that clearly does not State
um

04:57:23.628 --> 04:57:23.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:57:25.128 --> 04:57:25.138 align:start position:0%
High School
 
04:57:26.750 --> 04:57:26.760 align:start position:0%
or middle school
 
04:57:31.490 --> 04:57:31.500 align:start position:0%
and I think that that is the key to this
 
04:57:34.670 --> 04:57:34.680 align:start position:0%
is that it's not stated in law
 
04:57:37.010 --> 04:57:37.020 align:start position:0%
Elementary yeah there's no problem in
 
04:57:38.570 --> 04:57:38.580 align:start position:0%
the elementary school
 
04:57:42.530 --> 04:57:42.540 align:start position:0%
but Junior I I subbed in the middle
 
04:57:42.540 --> 04:57:43.330 align:start position:0%
but Junior I I subbed in the middle
school

04:57:43.330 --> 04:57:43.340 align:start position:0%
school
 
04:57:47.510 --> 04:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
for four years and I was handing out a
 
04:57:50.150 --> 04:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
dollar bills like crazy because I saw
 
04:57:52.190 --> 04:57:52.200 align:start position:0%
kids sitting there with nothing in front
 
04:57:54.470 --> 04:57:54.480 align:start position:0%
of them guys you know aren't you hungry
 
04:57:57.230 --> 04:57:57.240 align:start position:0%
I don't have a meal card or I lost my
 
04:57:59.868 --> 04:57:59.878 align:start position:0%
meal card or you know that and I know
 
04:58:02.270 --> 04:58:02.280 align:start position:0%
what it's like I have four in that age
 
04:58:04.610 --> 04:58:04.620 align:start position:0%
level right now and they're lucky they
 
04:58:05.930 --> 04:58:05.940 align:start position:0%
know where their pants are in the
 
04:58:09.350 --> 04:58:09.360 align:start position:0%
morning so it's it's very important that
 
04:58:12.350 --> 04:58:12.360 align:start position:0%
those kids get taken care of too and the
 
04:58:14.750 --> 04:58:14.760 align:start position:0%
high school kids poverty doesn't stop
 
04:58:16.730 --> 04:58:16.740 align:start position:0%
when you get into Middle School
 
04:58:21.170 --> 04:58:21.180 align:start position:0%
and I think that uh this would be a good
 
04:58:22.970 --> 04:58:22.980 align:start position:0%
bill to pass
 
04:58:25.490 --> 04:58:25.500 align:start position:0%
I don't agree with the IPO I think it's
 
04:58:27.890 --> 04:58:27.900 align:start position:0%
important anything that we can get in
 
04:58:31.490 --> 04:58:31.500 align:start position:0%
the hands of kids today is a good thing
 
04:58:34.128 --> 04:58:34.138 align:start position:0%
and I think that that because that's not
 
04:58:36.708 --> 04:58:36.718 align:start position:0%
clearly understood by the department of
 
04:58:39.530 --> 04:58:39.540 align:start position:0%
Ed I think that means that we need to
 
04:58:42.890 --> 04:58:42.900 align:start position:0%
have something from us in writing thank
 
04:58:44.270 --> 04:58:44.280 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
04:58:45.890 --> 04:58:45.900 align:start position:0%
um I would like to point out again that
 
04:58:47.690 --> 04:58:47.700 align:start position:0%
that is the same thing that I pulled up
 
04:58:49.910 --> 04:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
in my email that we're referring to that
 
04:58:53.150 --> 04:58:53.160 align:start position:0%
was from November 15th of 2016. the
 
04:58:56.470 --> 04:58:56.480 align:start position:0%
statutes have been updated since then
 
04:58:58.850 --> 04:58:58.860 align:start position:0%
does it say high school and medical it
 
04:59:02.090 --> 04:59:02.100 align:start position:0%
says all students it says each School
 
04:59:04.368 --> 04:59:04.378 align:start position:0%
each school is what's currently in the
 
04:59:04.378 --> 04:59:05.330 align:start position:0%
each school is what's currently in the
law

04:59:05.330 --> 04:59:05.340 align:start position:0%
law
 
04:59:07.490 --> 04:59:07.500 align:start position:0%
doesn't say anything about grades at all
 
04:59:11.510 --> 04:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
so that 2016 one is out of date
 
04:59:14.628 --> 04:59:14.638 align:start position:0%
this got updated in 2019 and it says
 
04:59:19.970 --> 04:59:19.980 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:19.980 --> 04:59:24.288 align:start position:0%
 
I

04:59:24.288 --> 04:59:24.298 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:27.350 --> 04:59:27.360 align:start position:0%
I Mr chair with your Indulgence I'm just
 
04:59:29.090 --> 04:59:29.100 align:start position:0%
going to respond to that because I I
 
04:59:31.250 --> 04:59:31.260 align:start position:0%
feel like this is the dialogue that I'm
 
04:59:31.260 --> 04:59:32.330 align:start position:0%
feel like this is the dialogue that I'm
in

04:59:32.330 --> 04:59:32.340 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:59:34.730 --> 04:59:34.740 align:start position:0%
um I don't feel confident representative
 
04:59:36.650 --> 04:59:36.660 align:start position:0%
Leon and representative Lucas I hear
 
04:59:38.810 --> 04:59:38.820 align:start position:0%
what you're saying that it says that the
 
04:59:43.490 --> 04:59:43.500 align:start position:0%
statute was updated in uh 2019 I just
 
04:59:46.490 --> 04:59:46.500 align:start position:0%
don't know what part of the statute was
 
04:59:50.810 --> 04:59:50.820 align:start position:0%
updated in 2019 I I don't I I mean I
 
04:59:53.330 --> 04:59:53.340 align:start position:0%
don't know that you know that either
 
04:59:55.730 --> 04:59:55.740 align:start position:0%
um I understand the data is on the RSA
 
04:59:55.740 --> 04:59:58.190 align:start position:0%
um I understand the data is on the RSA
but

04:59:58.190 --> 04:59:58.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:01.128 --> 05:00:01.138 align:start position:0%
um this is a technical advisory document
 
05:00:03.288 --> 05:00:03.298 align:start position:0%
that came from the Department of
 
05:00:06.770 --> 05:00:06.780 align:start position:0%
Education so this is what they're using
 
05:00:11.270 --> 05:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
to go by in making their decisions uh
 
05:00:13.250 --> 05:00:13.260 align:start position:0%
and I also you know I'm not looking to
 
05:00:15.830 --> 05:00:15.840 align:start position:0%
make this into a huge issue I just uh
 
05:00:17.510 --> 05:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
feel that
 
05:00:20.390 --> 05:00:20.400 align:start position:0%
rather than it yelling this we ought to
 
05:00:22.670 --> 05:00:22.680 align:start position:0%
be looking at whether or not there's
 
05:00:26.090 --> 05:00:26.100 align:start position:0%
Merit in retaining it or passing it
 
05:00:29.208 --> 05:00:29.218 align:start position:0%
can I can I read Section 8 of the
 
05:00:30.410 --> 05:00:30.420 align:start position:0%
current law
 
05:00:32.448 --> 05:00:32.458 align:start position:0%
there's a school lunch meal payment
 
05:00:34.730 --> 05:00:34.740 align:start position:0%
policy which is implemented by a school
 
05:00:36.470 --> 05:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
board either before after the effective
 
05:00:39.590 --> 05:00:39.600 align:start position:0%
date of this section challenge sure that
 
05:00:41.810 --> 05:00:41.820 align:start position:0%
all students have access to a healthy
 
05:00:43.970 --> 05:00:43.980 align:start position:0%
school lunch that the school district
 
05:00:46.070 --> 05:00:46.080 align:start position:0%
will make every reasonable effort to
 
05:00:48.830 --> 05:00:48.840 align:start position:0%
inform parents of the policy and that no
 
05:00:50.690 --> 05:00:50.700 align:start position:0%
student will be subject to different
 
05:00:53.510 --> 05:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
treatment from the standard school lunch
 
05:00:56.330 --> 05:00:56.340 align:start position:0%
meal or school's cafeteria procedures
 
05:00:58.788 --> 05:00:58.798 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education or the State
 
05:01:01.010 --> 05:01:01.020 align:start position:0%
Board of Education upon request of the
 
05:01:03.050 --> 05:01:03.060 align:start position:0%
local school board May provide
 
05:01:05.330 --> 05:01:05.340 align:start position:0%
communication assistance to school
 
05:01:07.010 --> 05:01:07.020 align:start position:0%
districts and parents of school children
 
05:01:09.590 --> 05:01:09.600 align:start position:0%
regarding the school lunch meal payment
 
05:01:13.850 --> 05:01:13.860 align:start position:0%
policy basically that says what this was
 
05:01:16.730 --> 05:01:16.740 align:start position:0%
trying to do it's already been done
 
05:01:20.930 --> 05:01:20.940 align:start position:0%
it's in it's that's current law
 
05:01:24.050 --> 05:01:24.060 align:start position:0%
okay so that could I respond to that Mr
 
05:01:26.628 --> 05:01:26.638 align:start position:0%
chair Mr Man
 
05:01:29.690 --> 05:01:29.700 align:start position:0%
um yes representative fleckis if that
 
05:01:31.430 --> 05:01:31.440 align:start position:0%
change has been made and it's not
 
05:01:34.430 --> 05:01:34.440 align:start position:0%
reflected in the technical advisory from
 
05:01:36.708 --> 05:01:36.718 align:start position:0%
the doe then obviously we need to look
 
05:01:41.270 --> 05:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
at where the disconnect is in that in
 
05:01:43.550 --> 05:01:43.560 align:start position:0%
addition to that there's a section of
 
05:01:46.730 --> 05:01:46.740 align:start position:0%
the bill that deals with
 
05:01:49.730 --> 05:01:49.740 align:start position:0%
um communication between the Food
 
05:01:54.050 --> 05:01:54.060 align:start position:0%
Services Program and the family
 
05:01:57.170 --> 05:01:57.180 align:start position:0%
um that indicates that only the family
 
05:02:00.170 --> 05:02:00.180 align:start position:0%
the parents or Guardians will be in
 
05:02:04.010 --> 05:02:04.020 align:start position:0%
conversation about insufficient funds or
 
05:02:06.708 --> 05:02:06.718 align:start position:0%
it's uh
 
05:02:10.250 --> 05:02:10.260 align:start position:0%
section c Roman Roman nine line eight
 
05:02:12.830 --> 05:02:12.840 align:start position:0%
Roman nine section c
 
05:02:12.840 --> 05:02:14.150 align:start position:0%
Roman nine section c
right

05:02:14.150 --> 05:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:02:16.730 --> 05:02:16.740 align:start position:0%
but this this I mean in that it says the
 
05:02:17.810 --> 05:02:17.820 align:start position:0%
school district will make every
 
05:02:19.970 --> 05:02:19.980 align:start position:0%
reasonable effort to inform parents
 
05:02:22.128 --> 05:02:22.138 align:start position:0%
right it doesn't say informed Church
 
05:02:26.110 --> 05:02:26.120 align:start position:0%
students it says Mr chairman
 
05:02:30.490 --> 05:02:30.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:32.628 --> 05:02:32.638 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm sorry I'm just trying to say
 
05:02:34.310 --> 05:02:34.320 align:start position:0%
what the current law is because I have
 
05:02:36.368 --> 05:02:36.378 align:start position:0%
it right in front of them
 
05:02:40.070 --> 05:02:40.080 align:start position:0%
yeah do we have anybody from the
 
05:02:41.690 --> 05:02:41.700 align:start position:0%
Department of Ed
 
05:02:44.330 --> 05:02:44.340 align:start position:0%
listening in today I mean it's common
 
05:02:47.690 --> 05:02:47.700 align:start position:0%
practice to ask for advice
 
05:02:49.610 --> 05:02:49.620 align:start position:0%
uh at least on other committees that
 
05:02:50.810 --> 05:02:50.820 align:start position:0%
I've been on
 
05:02:52.490 --> 05:02:52.500 align:start position:0%
um from the administrative side of
 
05:02:54.948 --> 05:02:54.958 align:start position:0%
things if they have anything to say that
 
05:02:56.868 --> 05:02:56.878 align:start position:0%
perhaps could clarify this situation
 
05:02:58.850 --> 05:02:58.860 align:start position:0%
here since there seems to be a
 
05:03:01.270 --> 05:03:01.280 align:start position:0%
discrepancy potentially between statute
 
05:03:03.948 --> 05:03:03.958 align:start position:0%
and uh the Department's administrative
 
05:03:06.170 --> 05:03:06.180 align:start position:0%
guidelines yes we do have attorney
 
05:03:09.650 --> 05:03:09.660 align:start position:0%
Fenton on here on board we can have her
 
05:03:11.750 --> 05:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
and perhaps if you need me we can get
 
05:03:13.730 --> 05:03:13.740 align:start position:0%
somebody that's working with the
 
05:03:16.550 --> 05:03:16.560 align:start position:0%
nutrition program there at doe to get
 
05:03:20.270 --> 05:03:20.280 align:start position:0%
involved in this too so uh I I feel
 
05:03:21.830 --> 05:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable passing anything where
 
05:03:24.230 --> 05:03:24.240 align:start position:0%
this is disconnect or an advisory says
 
05:03:25.670 --> 05:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
one thing the statutory is something
 
05:03:27.470 --> 05:03:27.480 align:start position:0%
that what what are we dealing with here
 
05:03:31.010 --> 05:03:31.020 align:start position:0%
so that needs some resolution is Diane
 
05:03:31.020 --> 05:03:31.930 align:start position:0%
so that needs some resolution is Diane
there

05:03:31.930 --> 05:03:31.940 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:03:36.650 --> 05:03:36.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:38.390 --> 05:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
 
05:03:42.948 --> 05:03:42.958 align:start position:0%
uh so I've been looking at 189 11a and
 
05:03:44.868 --> 05:03:44.878 align:start position:0%
the technical advisory
 
05:03:47.948 --> 05:03:47.958 align:start position:0%
um I was texting with Sherry White
 
05:03:51.530 --> 05:03:51.540 align:start position:0%
she does believe that the law is
 
05:03:54.830 --> 05:03:54.840 align:start position:0%
applicable to all the grades but because
 
05:03:58.690 --> 05:03:58.700 align:start position:0%
the doe issue advisory
 
05:04:01.670 --> 05:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
that states something contrary to that
 
05:04:05.510 --> 05:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
I'm hesitant to stand behind that um
 
05:04:09.110 --> 05:04:09.120 align:start position:0%
we need to correct that ta if that's the
 
05:04:11.150 --> 05:04:11.160 align:start position:0%
guidance we're actually putting out so I
 
05:04:13.368 --> 05:04:13.378 align:start position:0%
would request some time to have sherry
 
05:04:15.948 --> 05:04:15.958 align:start position:0%
white actually address that inquiry but
 
05:04:20.350 --> 05:04:20.360 align:start position:0%
from my reading of 18911 a
 
05:04:20.360 --> 05:04:21.590 align:start position:0%
from my reading of 18911 a
[Music]

05:04:21.590 --> 05:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:04:23.448 --> 05:04:23.458 align:start position:0%
and the amendment that was passed I
 
05:04:26.090 --> 05:04:26.100 align:start position:0%
think it is applicable to all ages but I
 
05:04:28.190 --> 05:04:28.200 align:start position:0%
understand where rep Mullins
 
05:04:30.230 --> 05:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
question comes from and I think it's
 
05:04:32.390 --> 05:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
worth taking the time to make sure that
 
05:04:34.970 --> 05:04:34.980 align:start position:0%
the doe can properly address that and
 
05:04:37.010 --> 05:04:37.020 align:start position:0%
I'm just not the person to really be
 
05:04:38.750 --> 05:04:38.760 align:start position:0%
able to address that
 
05:04:41.150 --> 05:04:41.160 align:start position:0%
um I would prefer to Sherry white so let
 
05:04:43.250 --> 05:04:43.260 align:start position:0%
me just see if she can hop on you give
 
05:04:45.470 --> 05:04:45.480 align:start position:0%
me just two seconds
 
05:04:47.750 --> 05:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
um I'm gonna ask Sherry white to hop on
 
05:04:47.760 --> 05:04:48.530 align:start position:0%
um I'm gonna ask Sherry white to hop on
the

05:04:48.530 --> 05:04:48.540 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:04:48.540 --> 05:04:52.850 align:start position:0%
the
discussion

05:04:52.850 --> 05:04:52.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:55.190 --> 05:04:55.200 align:start position:0%
I think we're where I'm going to go with
 
05:04:58.368 --> 05:04:58.378 align:start position:0%
this right now is that uh we need to
 
05:05:00.230 --> 05:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
have specific clarification from the
 
05:05:01.610 --> 05:05:01.620 align:start position:0%
Department I don't want to guesswork
 
05:05:04.430 --> 05:05:04.440 align:start position:0%
over there I want things to be solid I
 
05:05:06.948 --> 05:05:06.958 align:start position:0%
want to see it in print so I'm not going
 
05:05:10.550 --> 05:05:10.560 align:start position:0%
to go any further with this bill today
 
05:05:12.530 --> 05:05:12.540 align:start position:0%
um we're gonna pull it stop right there
 
05:05:16.368 --> 05:05:16.378 align:start position:0%
recess this bill until the Tuesday of
 
05:05:17.690 --> 05:05:17.700 align:start position:0%
next week
 
05:05:20.150 --> 05:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
when we will have more information back
 
05:05:22.190 --> 05:05:22.200 align:start position:0%
I know when Diana gets back I'll let her
 
05:05:26.150 --> 05:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
know that but uh I think there's uh
 
05:05:28.430 --> 05:05:28.440 align:start position:0%
there's just too much acrimony on it not
 
05:05:30.170 --> 05:05:30.180 align:start position:0%
acrimony but too much there's just a
 
05:05:31.788 --> 05:05:31.798 align:start position:0%
disconnect I don't know what we've been
 
05:05:33.770 --> 05:05:33.780 align:start position:0%
giving them that advisory and what we
 
05:05:36.890 --> 05:05:36.900 align:start position:0%
see in statute and this legislature
 
05:05:39.890 --> 05:05:39.900 align:start position:0%
wants to know exactly what's going on
 
05:05:46.610 --> 05:05:46.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:49.070 --> 05:05:49.080 align:start position:0%
not well I like that Diana said she's
 
05:05:50.990 --> 05:05:51.000 align:start position:0%
coming back but we'll explain it to her
 
05:05:54.530 --> 05:05:54.540 align:start position:0%
as well uh when when she gets back at
 
05:06:00.730 --> 05:06:00.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:03.470 --> 05:06:03.480 align:start position:0%
no if she's coming back I don't want you
 
05:06:05.330 --> 05:06:05.340 align:start position:0%
to say You're Gone Diana and she comes
 
05:06:06.890 --> 05:06:06.900 align:start position:0%
back okay
 
05:06:09.110 --> 05:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
um I don't want anybody there having to
 
05:06:11.330 --> 05:06:11.340 align:start position:0%
reach out and make adjustment based upon
 
05:06:13.128 --> 05:06:13.138 align:start position:0%
who knows what
 
05:06:13.138 --> 05:06:14.230 align:start position:0%
who knows what
um

05:06:14.230 --> 05:06:14.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:06:17.690 --> 05:06:17.700 align:start position:0%
do I need to recall the motion so that
 
05:06:27.410 --> 05:06:27.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:29.590 --> 05:06:29.600 align:start position:0%
I mean next week
 
05:06:33.948 --> 05:06:33.958 align:start position:0%
but depending upon what we find out but
 
05:06:33.958 --> 05:06:35.270 align:start position:0%
but depending upon what we find out but
um

05:06:35.270 --> 05:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:06:38.990 --> 05:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:41.090 --> 05:06:41.100 align:start position:0%
chairman I believe Sherry white will be
 
05:06:43.550 --> 05:06:43.560 align:start position:0%
joining you shortly Diane Were You There
 
05:06:46.128 --> 05:06:46.138 align:start position:0%
When I just spoke to the committee
 
05:06:48.250 --> 05:06:48.260 align:start position:0%
I would
 
05:06:50.810 --> 05:06:50.820 align:start position:0%
do is that I'm not going to take any
 
05:06:54.110 --> 05:06:54.120 align:start position:0%
further on this bill today and most
 
05:06:57.350 --> 05:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
likely we will discuss this then uh one
 
05:06:59.930 --> 05:06:59.940 align:start position:0%
one week from today on the following
 
05:07:03.170 --> 05:07:03.180 align:start position:0%
Tuesday when we can get more specific
 
05:07:05.390 --> 05:07:05.400 align:start position:0%
information from you and from the
 
05:07:06.890 --> 05:07:06.900 align:start position:0%
Department regarding the nutrition
 
05:07:11.110 --> 05:07:11.120 align:start position:0%
program uh as to where we are with that
 
05:07:14.570 --> 05:07:14.580 align:start position:0%
advisory where we are with statue and
 
05:07:17.510 --> 05:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
basically there are three items in that
 
05:07:20.770 --> 05:07:20.780 align:start position:0%
bill right now which I'm concerned with
 
05:07:25.250 --> 05:07:25.260 align:start position:0%
minerals 9 a b and c
 
05:07:25.260 --> 05:07:31.030 align:start position:0%
minerals 9 a b and c
um

05:07:31.030 --> 05:07:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:32.990 --> 05:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
different or
 
05:07:35.410 --> 05:07:35.420 align:start position:0%
dealing with uh
 
05:07:38.930 --> 05:07:38.940 align:start position:0%
and then the prohibiting of a child who
 
05:07:41.628 --> 05:07:41.638 align:start position:0%
cannot pay for a meal uh from doing any
 
05:07:44.448 --> 05:07:44.458 align:start position:0%
work I don't that that's obviously to me
 
05:07:46.670 --> 05:07:46.680 align:start position:0%
not a practice that schools should be
 
05:07:49.070 --> 05:07:49.080 align:start position:0%
doing for all
 
05:07:50.570 --> 05:07:50.580 align:start position:0%
um and and I'd like to know if there's
 
05:07:52.190 --> 05:07:52.200 align:start position:0%
anything that's mentioned to that either
 
05:07:55.190 --> 05:07:55.200 align:start position:0%
in rule or it's not just or in a federal
 
05:07:55.200 --> 05:07:56.590 align:start position:0%
in rule or it's not just or in a federal
advisory

05:07:56.590 --> 05:07:56.600 align:start position:0%
advisory
 
05:07:59.690 --> 05:07:59.700 align:start position:0%
and then three uh that Communications
 
05:08:01.970 --> 05:08:01.980 align:start position:0%
that are going home yes they can be
 
05:08:04.010 --> 05:08:04.020 align:start position:0%
given to a student but they're not going
 
05:08:05.990 --> 05:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
to be communicated to the student to
 
05:08:08.330 --> 05:08:08.340 align:start position:0%
then verbalize them and send them that
 
05:08:08.340 --> 05:08:09.350 align:start position:0%
then verbalize them and send them that
way

05:08:09.350 --> 05:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
way
 
05:08:11.750 --> 05:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
um through the student that's uh not
 
05:08:13.250 --> 05:08:13.260 align:start position:0%
really a great idea
 
05:08:14.990 --> 05:08:15.000 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
05:08:17.330 --> 05:08:17.340 align:start position:0%
um there's some great points there in
 
05:08:19.670 --> 05:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
that bill
 
05:08:22.010 --> 05:08:22.020 align:start position:0%
I've just always been as a school
 
05:08:25.010 --> 05:08:25.020 align:start position:0%
principal under the assumption that
 
05:08:26.930 --> 05:08:26.940 align:start position:0%
those things were in place and we were
 
05:08:28.448 --> 05:08:28.458 align:start position:0%
doing those things
 
05:08:30.708 --> 05:08:30.718 align:start position:0%
but I don't know if that's the case
 
05:08:39.350 --> 05:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:39.360 --> 05:08:45.230 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:08:45.230 --> 05:08:45.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:47.570 --> 05:08:47.580 align:start position:0%
you know we have another a bill dealing
 
05:08:50.030 --> 05:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
with uh school lunch and I prefer not to
 
05:08:51.288 --> 05:08:51.298 align:start position:0%
take that up until we get some
 
05:08:54.170 --> 05:08:54.180 align:start position:0%
clarification on this bill so what I'm
 
05:08:55.788 --> 05:08:55.798 align:start position:0%
going to do because I did communicate
 
05:08:59.270 --> 05:08:59.280 align:start position:0%
these five bills to representative at
 
05:09:01.368 --> 05:09:01.378 align:start position:0%
the lunch break we did three of them we
 
05:09:03.650 --> 05:09:03.660 align:start position:0%
have two to two here plus a few others
 
05:09:06.288 --> 05:09:06.298 align:start position:0%
still so uh I'm not going to go forward
 
05:09:08.270 --> 05:09:08.280 align:start position:0%
with any other bills today
 
05:09:10.850 --> 05:09:10.860 align:start position:0%
uh we have a couple members here that
 
05:09:12.530 --> 05:09:12.540 align:start position:0%
have to be out of here to pick up kids
 
05:09:14.990 --> 05:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
out of school by 2 30
 
05:09:18.288 --> 05:09:18.298 align:start position:0%
um we're closing into that hour so uh
 
05:09:20.030 --> 05:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
are there any more Communications or
 
05:09:22.550 --> 05:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
suggestions from from the committee as a
 
05:09:22.560 --> 05:09:25.910 align:start position:0%
