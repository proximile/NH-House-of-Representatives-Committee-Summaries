our fish and game conservation officers
 
01:16:50.270 --> 01:16:50.280 align:start position:0%
would require a warrant
 
01:16:52.729 --> 01:16:52.739 align:start position:0%
um to do certain searches part of this
 
01:16:55.970 --> 01:16:55.980 align:start position:0%
stems back to a change in the law under
 
01:16:59.149 --> 01:16:59.159 align:start position:0%
section 206 26 normally this would be a
 
01:17:00.470 --> 01:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
phishing gain build
 
01:17:03.649 --> 01:17:03.659 align:start position:0%
and that section is the powers of the
 
01:17:06.110 --> 01:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
officers of Fish and Game and I'm going
 
01:17:08.390 --> 01:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
to read write a little bit of that as an
 
01:17:09.770 --> 01:17:09.780 align:start position:0%
introduction because that will help
 
01:17:12.290 --> 01:17:12.300 align:start position:0%
explain the rationale for the bill
 
01:17:15.169 --> 01:17:15.179 align:start position:0%
206 26 Powers the executive director is
 
01:17:16.610 --> 01:17:16.620 align:start position:0%
certified as a police officer in
 
01:17:19.669 --> 01:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
accordance with RSA 106-l colon 5 Roman
 
01:17:21.410 --> 01:17:21.420 align:start position:0%
numeral 5 and each conservation officer
 
01:17:23.570 --> 01:17:23.580 align:start position:0%
shall have the following powers to
 
01:17:26.750 --> 01:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
enforce all laws rules and regulations
 
01:17:29.990 --> 01:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
relating to all wildlife
 
01:17:31.669 --> 01:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
I'm going to say that again relating to
 
01:17:33.290 --> 01:17:33.300 align:start position:0%
all Wildlife to go on any property
 
01:17:34.729 --> 01:17:34.739 align:start position:0%
outside the buildings posted or
 
01:17:34.739 --> 01:17:35.750 align:start position:0%
outside the buildings posted or
otherwise

01:17:35.750 --> 01:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
otherwise
 
01:17:37.669 --> 01:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral two to execute all
 
01:17:39.229 --> 01:17:39.239 align:start position:0%
warrants in search warrants based on
 
01:17:41.390 --> 01:17:41.400 align:start position:0%
probable cause for the violation of laws
 
01:17:43.669 --> 01:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
rules and regulations relating to
 
01:17:43.679 --> 01:17:45.290 align:start position:0%
rules and regulations relating to
Wildlife

01:17:45.290 --> 01:17:45.300 align:start position:0%
Wildlife
 
01:17:47.209 --> 01:17:47.219 align:start position:0%
so we understand that their job is
 
01:17:49.189 --> 01:17:49.199 align:start position:0%
regarding wildlife
 
01:17:52.010 --> 01:17:52.020 align:start position:0%
however a couple years ago we added to
 
01:17:54.590 --> 01:17:54.600 align:start position:0%
enforce all provisions of RSA title 21
 
01:17:57.649 --> 01:17:57.659 align:start position:0%
relative to Motor Vehicle Laws absent
 
01:18:00.050 --> 01:18:00.060 align:start position:0%
any violation or suspected violation of
 
01:18:03.590 --> 01:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:05.810 --> 01:18:05.820 align:start position:0%
so we have our conservation officers
 
01:18:08.689 --> 01:18:08.699 align:start position:0%
enforcing DMV laws absent fishing game
 
01:18:08.699 --> 01:18:09.890 align:start position:0%
enforcing DMV laws absent fishing game
loss

01:18:09.890 --> 01:18:09.900 align:start position:0%
loss
 
01:18:12.110 --> 01:18:12.120 align:start position:0%
I thought we hired them to handle Fish
 
01:18:13.430 --> 01:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
and Game loss
 
01:18:15.410 --> 01:18:15.420 align:start position:0%
not to be super cops
 
01:18:18.050 --> 01:18:18.060 align:start position:0%
so the problem is since we've given them
 
01:18:20.750 --> 01:18:20.760 align:start position:0%
the authority to do warrantless searches
 
01:18:23.209 --> 01:18:23.219 align:start position:0%
in clear violation of both the U.S
 
01:18:23.219 --> 01:18:24.649 align:start position:0%
in clear violation of both the U.S
Constitution

01:18:24.649 --> 01:18:24.659 align:start position:0%
Constitution
 
01:18:26.709 --> 01:18:26.719 align:start position:0%
Bill of Rights
 
01:18:30.649 --> 01:18:30.659 align:start position:0%
uh article 6 if I were
 
01:18:32.630 --> 01:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
recall the right of the people to be
 
01:18:35.030 --> 01:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
secure in their persons houses papers
 
01:18:36.590 --> 01:18:36.600 align:start position:0%
and effects against unreasonable
 
01:18:38.390 --> 01:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
searches and seizures shall not be
 
01:18:41.149 --> 01:18:41.159 align:start position:0%
violated and no warrant shall issue but
 
01:18:44.689 --> 01:18:44.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:46.790 --> 01:18:46.800 align:start position:0%
and there's a similar provision in part
 
01:18:48.950 --> 01:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
first article
 
01:18:51.470 --> 01:18:51.480 align:start position:0%
19 of the New Hampshire Constitution
 
01:18:54.770 --> 01:18:54.780 align:start position:0%
almost verbatim language
 
01:18:58.370 --> 01:18:58.380 align:start position:0%
why do we allow one particular set of
 
01:19:01.490 --> 01:19:01.500 align:start position:0%
Fish and Game officers to have greater
 
01:19:01.500 --> 01:19:02.570 align:start position:0%
Fish and Game officers to have greater
Authority

01:19:02.570 --> 01:19:02.580 align:start position:0%
Authority
 
01:19:05.330 --> 01:19:05.340 align:start position:0%
than the state police greater Authority
 
01:19:08.270 --> 01:19:08.280 align:start position:0%
than any police officer in any Town
 
01:19:10.370 --> 01:19:10.380 align:start position:0%
within the state
 
01:19:12.649 --> 01:19:12.659 align:start position:0%
if we fix the section about enforcement
 
01:19:14.630 --> 01:19:14.640 align:start position:0%
of DMV laws it wouldn't be as bad an
 
01:19:14.640 --> 01:19:16.189 align:start position:0%
of DMV laws it wouldn't be as bad an
issue

01:19:16.189 --> 01:19:16.199 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:19:18.229 --> 01:19:18.239 align:start position:0%
I can understand the argument it's
 
01:19:19.790 --> 01:19:19.800 align:start position:0%
really hard to get a warrant when you're
 
01:19:22.250 --> 01:19:22.260 align:start position:0%
in the middle of a lake got it let's
 
01:19:24.530 --> 01:19:24.540 align:start position:0%
have that discussion okay you can tell
 
01:19:26.270 --> 01:19:26.280 align:start position:0%
the person right I want to search your
 
01:19:29.030 --> 01:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
your Bait Box I want to search right
 
01:19:31.550 --> 01:19:31.560 align:start position:0%
your fish container I understand that
 
01:19:33.830 --> 01:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
okay the person can say I want to see a
 
01:19:35.990 --> 01:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
Warren and the Fish and Game officer can
 
01:19:39.110 --> 01:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
say great understand there's a huge time
 
01:19:41.330 --> 01:19:41.340 align:start position:0%
hit when we do this conversation because
 
01:19:43.490 --> 01:19:43.500 align:start position:0%
I'm going to call in and get someone
 
01:19:44.930 --> 01:19:44.940 align:start position:0%
else to come
 
01:19:46.790 --> 01:19:46.800 align:start position:0%
and they're going to have to then go get
 
01:19:49.189 --> 01:19:49.199 align:start position:0%
a warrant so plan for a six or eight
 
01:19:51.649 --> 01:19:51.659 align:start position:0%
hour exchange but the person has that
 
01:19:51.659 --> 01:19:52.790 align:start position:0%
hour exchange but the person has that
right

01:19:52.790 --> 01:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:19:55.430 --> 01:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
that's in the Constitution we don't just
 
01:19:58.130 --> 01:19:58.140 align:start position:0%
give those rights up now the person may
 
01:19:59.750 --> 01:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
yield that right and that is within
 
01:20:01.490 --> 01:20:01.500 align:start position:0%
their power to say oh I don't mind you
 
01:20:03.050 --> 01:20:03.060 align:start position:0%
searching there's nothing in the in the
 
01:20:05.510 --> 01:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
bait box or nothing in in in my fish
 
01:20:07.550 --> 01:20:07.560 align:start position:0%
container that would be
 
01:20:09.950 --> 01:20:09.960 align:start position:0%
um prohibited anyway right I'm not using
 
01:20:12.470 --> 01:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
the wrong type of lures I'm not using
 
01:20:15.530 --> 01:20:15.540 align:start position:0%
the these aren't lead or whatever the
 
01:20:17.030 --> 01:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
concern is right there's lots of fishing
 
01:20:18.649 --> 01:20:18.659 align:start position:0%
game laws I'm not not going to be
 
01:20:20.149 --> 01:20:20.159 align:start position:0%
pretend to be an expert on all the fish
 
01:20:22.310 --> 01:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
and game laws
 
01:20:24.830 --> 01:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
but our laws should support the
 
01:20:27.470 --> 01:20:27.480 align:start position:0%
underlying structure and agreement that
 
01:20:29.810 --> 01:20:29.820 align:start position:0%
our entire State and country was founded
 
01:20:32.330 --> 01:20:32.340 align:start position:0%
upon which is the Constitution and in
 
01:20:35.330 --> 01:20:35.340 align:start position:0%
this case we have a knowingly a vial a
 
01:20:38.870 --> 01:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
statute that knowingly violates right
 
01:20:40.729 --> 01:20:40.739 align:start position:0%
the warrant claw the search warrant
 
01:20:44.090 --> 01:20:44.100 align:start position:0%
Clause so all this bill does is insist
 
01:20:46.970 --> 01:20:46.980 align:start position:0%
that the officer seek a warrant
 
01:20:49.610 --> 01:20:49.620 align:start position:0%
understand that those in the field right
 
01:20:49.620 --> 01:20:50.630 align:start position:0%
understand that those in the field right
who

01:20:50.630 --> 01:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
who
 
01:20:52.729 --> 01:20:52.739 align:start position:0%
um the conservation officers approached
 
01:20:54.470 --> 01:20:54.480 align:start position:0%
can waive that right that is their
 
01:20:54.480 --> 01:20:55.970 align:start position:0%
can waive that right that is their
choice

01:20:55.970 --> 01:20:55.980 align:start position:0%
choice
 
01:20:57.890 --> 01:20:57.900 align:start position:0%
if they waive that right it doesn't
 
01:21:00.290 --> 01:21:00.300 align:start position:0%
change anything about how a search would
 
01:21:03.290 --> 01:21:03.300 align:start position:0%
be conducted but they do have the right
 
01:21:05.570 --> 01:21:05.580 align:start position:0%
the problem is
 
01:21:07.669 --> 01:21:07.679 align:start position:0%
because we've expanded their authority
 
01:21:09.470 --> 01:21:09.480 align:start position:0%
over the years to be more than just
 
01:21:12.189 --> 01:21:12.199 align:start position:0%
conservation officers they are now
 
01:21:15.110 --> 01:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
effectively State Police and in and
 
01:21:19.790 --> 01:21:19.800 align:start position:0%
charged with enforcing the DMV laws they
 
01:21:21.410 --> 01:21:21.420 align:start position:0%
can pull someone over on the side of the
 
01:21:23.450 --> 01:21:23.460 align:start position:0%
road and say I'm searching your car and
 
01:21:25.310 --> 01:21:25.320 align:start position:0%
the person doesn't have the right to say
 
01:21:27.709 --> 01:21:27.719 align:start position:0%
no I'd like to see a warrant and one
 
01:21:29.570 --> 01:21:29.580 align:start position:0%
could make the argument if you're on a
 
01:21:31.970 --> 01:21:31.980 align:start position:0%
major highway and you're enforcing DMV
 
01:21:34.010 --> 01:21:34.020 align:start position:0%
laws the ability to get a warrant just
 
01:21:35.390 --> 01:21:35.400 align:start position:0%
like the state police would have to do
 
01:21:37.430 --> 01:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
is pretty easy so with that I'll
 
01:21:43.910 --> 01:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:46.910 --> 01:21:46.920 align:start position:0%
representative do you have any um
 
01:21:50.510 --> 01:21:50.520 align:start position:0%
any ideas about why that power was
 
01:21:53.330 --> 01:21:53.340 align:start position:0%
granted to them regarding the motor
 
01:21:55.250 --> 01:21:55.260 align:start position:0%
vehicles I understand that they're
 
01:21:57.770 --> 01:21:57.780 align:start position:0%
oftentimes Motor Vehicles involved in
 
01:21:59.750 --> 01:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
Fish and Game Vehicles hunting from a
 
01:22:01.390 --> 01:22:01.400 align:start position:0%
vehicle or it shouldn't be
 
01:22:05.330 --> 01:22:05.340 align:start position:0%
but remember as I read that law it's not
 
01:22:07.910 --> 01:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
in violation of a fish and game law it
 
01:22:11.450 --> 01:22:11.460 align:start position:0%
is beyond that if there was a vehicle in
 
01:22:14.590 --> 01:22:14.600 align:start position:0%
efficient game incident someone was was
 
01:22:17.750 --> 01:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
presumed to be shooting a firearm from a
 
01:22:19.669 --> 01:22:19.679 align:start position:0%
car right that would be handled very
 
01:22:23.090 --> 01:22:23.100 align:start position:0%
differently than enforcing a speeding
 
01:22:28.370 --> 01:22:28.380 align:start position:0%
write a speeding violation right or
 
01:22:28.380 --> 01:22:30.770 align:start position:0%
write a speeding violation right or
um

01:22:30.770 --> 01:22:30.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:32.510 --> 01:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't drink much but I'm going
 
01:22:34.189 --> 01:22:34.199 align:start position:0%
to use drinking as a good example I know
 
01:22:36.050 --> 01:22:36.060 align:start position:0%
it's a bad one given that there's
 
01:22:38.090 --> 01:22:38.100 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of pushback but someone
 
01:22:41.090 --> 01:22:41.100 align:start position:0%
crosses a yellow line or wavers across
 
01:22:44.570 --> 01:22:44.580 align:start position:0%
the white line and the officer suspects
 
01:22:46.669 --> 01:22:46.679 align:start position:0%
that the person was drinking and pulls
 
01:22:48.410 --> 01:22:48.420 align:start position:0%
them over and starts searching the car
 
01:22:52.910 --> 01:22:52.920 align:start position:0%
for alcohol right I'm pretty certain the
 
01:22:54.950 --> 01:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
person's right constitutional rights
 
01:22:56.930 --> 01:22:56.940 align:start position:0%
were violated now ordinarily they would
 
01:22:58.910 --> 01:22:58.920 align:start position:0%
just say hey no there's no alcohol in
 
01:23:01.970 --> 01:23:01.980 align:start position:0%
the car and if you want to search you
 
01:23:03.590 --> 01:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
can get a warrant
 
01:23:05.570 --> 01:23:05.580 align:start position:0%
I don't know if anybody's watched the
 
01:23:07.189 --> 01:23:07.199 align:start position:0%
cars on the sides of the roads that are
 
01:23:09.770 --> 01:23:09.780 align:start position:0%
being searched but pretty much all the
 
01:23:12.169 --> 01:23:12.179 align:start position:0%
contents of the car and are strewn about
 
01:23:15.110 --> 01:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
and it's a pretty invasive thing
 
01:23:17.510 --> 01:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
we ordinarily protect our citizens
 
01:23:19.970 --> 01:23:19.980 align:start position:0%
against such invasions okay unless
 
01:23:21.830 --> 01:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
there's probable cause which is what the
 
01:23:25.070 --> 01:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
grounds necessary for a warrant
 
01:23:25.080 --> 01:23:25.970 align:start position:0%
grounds necessary for a warrant
um

01:23:25.970 --> 01:23:25.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:28.250 --> 01:23:28.260 align:start position:0%
it's okay to say to somebody yes I'd
 
01:23:29.750 --> 01:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
like you to get a warrant before you
 
01:23:32.870 --> 01:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
perceive and if there's probable cause a
 
01:23:34.570 --> 01:23:34.580 align:start position:0%
judge will sign that pretty quickly
 
01:23:38.450 --> 01:23:38.460 align:start position:0%
within within an hour it might mean that
 
01:23:40.130 --> 01:23:40.140 align:start position:0%
the conservation officer is sitting on
 
01:23:41.209 --> 01:23:41.219 align:start position:0%
the side of the road for a little bit
 
01:23:43.669 --> 01:23:43.679 align:start position:0%
longer I get that that is a that delay
 
01:23:45.169 --> 01:23:45.179 align:start position:0%
means that person isn't on the job
 
01:23:48.590 --> 01:23:48.600 align:start position:0%
enforcing other things during that time
 
01:23:48.600 --> 01:23:50.450 align:start position:0%
enforcing other things during that time
however

01:23:50.450 --> 01:23:50.460 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:23:53.510 --> 01:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
um we have a set of rules which for the
 
01:23:55.610 --> 01:23:55.620 align:start position:0%
Constitution by what our democracy
 
01:23:57.649 --> 01:23:57.659 align:start position:0%
follows to make sure the role of
 
01:23:59.209 --> 01:23:59.219 align:start position:0%
government is understood and when we
 
01:24:01.010 --> 01:24:01.020 align:start position:0%
have statutes that violate those
 
01:24:03.410 --> 01:24:03.420 align:start position:0%
constitutional Provisions it is our job
 
01:24:06.530 --> 01:24:06.540 align:start position:0%
as state legislators to fix that
 
01:24:08.750 --> 01:24:08.760 align:start position:0%
so is is it your understanding of the
 
01:24:10.850 --> 01:24:10.860 align:start position:0%
current state of the law that
 
01:24:13.970 --> 01:24:13.980 align:start position:0%
the fish and game officers are not
 
01:24:16.430 --> 01:24:16.440 align:start position:0%
required to follow the same in other
 
01:24:18.470 --> 01:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
words if an officer pulls over someone
 
01:24:20.330 --> 01:24:20.340 align:start position:0%
and says hey do you mind if I take a
 
01:24:22.550 --> 01:24:22.560 align:start position:0%
look in the car and the guy says no
 
01:24:24.649 --> 01:24:24.659 align:start position:0%
pound saying get a warrant they have to
 
01:24:26.090 --> 01:24:26.100 align:start position:0%
get a warrant unless there's excellent
 
01:24:27.890 --> 01:24:27.900 align:start position:0%
circumstances that is true for the State
 
01:24:29.750 --> 01:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
Police is it your position that they can
 
01:24:31.430 --> 01:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
say well no you don't get to say no get
 
01:24:33.649 --> 01:24:33.659 align:start position:0%
out I'm searching your car that is that
 
01:24:36.470 --> 01:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
is the provisions today between the
 
01:24:39.350 --> 01:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
combination of this section of law here
 
01:24:41.450 --> 01:24:41.460 align:start position:0%
right because we're all we're all in 206
 
01:24:43.850 --> 01:24:43.860 align:start position:0%
26 and it's easy to look at the changes
 
01:24:45.229 --> 01:24:45.239 align:start position:0%
and go oh this doesn't make any sense
 
01:24:46.669 --> 01:24:46.679 align:start position:0%
that's why I wanted some context
 
01:24:49.250 --> 01:24:49.260 align:start position:0%
relative to the rest of the changes we
 
01:24:51.590 --> 01:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
added it Roman numeral 15.
 
01:24:53.270 --> 01:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
I want to say it was in the last 10
 
01:24:55.490 --> 01:24:55.500 align:start position:0%
years I the when I looked back it looks
 
01:24:57.410 --> 01:24:57.420 align:start position:0%
like it was in 2017 but I didn't go back
 
01:24:58.669 --> 01:24:58.679 align:start position:0%
and actually look for what gear that
 
01:25:00.350 --> 01:25:00.360 align:start position:0%
bill went through
 
01:25:03.770 --> 01:25:03.780 align:start position:0%
we added Provisions to the law that
 
01:25:06.709 --> 01:25:06.719 align:start position:0%
greatly expanded their powers much
 
01:25:07.990 --> 01:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
greater so
 
01:25:11.510 --> 01:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
than all the other officers law
 
01:25:13.550 --> 01:25:13.560 align:start position:0%
enforcement officers in the state and
 
01:25:16.430 --> 01:25:16.440 align:start position:0%
and that's where the conflict arises I
 
01:25:19.370 --> 01:25:19.380 align:start position:0%
understand why those had these these
 
01:25:21.830 --> 01:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
rules were in place for the person out
 
01:25:23.330 --> 01:25:23.340 align:start position:0%
on the middle of Lake Winnipesaukee
 
01:25:25.729 --> 01:25:25.739 align:start position:0%
right there's only one vote in the right
 
01:25:27.290 --> 01:25:27.300 align:start position:0%
that the conservation officer has he's
 
01:25:29.209 --> 01:25:29.219 align:start position:0%
pulled somebody over he what is he going
 
01:25:30.830 --> 01:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
to jump in the boat or the guys pulled
 
01:25:33.229 --> 01:25:33.239 align:start position:0%
over and and wait for his friend to run
 
01:25:34.850 --> 01:25:34.860 align:start position:0%
out to get a warrant and come back and
 
01:25:36.649 --> 01:25:36.659 align:start position:0%
there are there are technical
 
01:25:39.169 --> 01:25:39.179 align:start position:0%
difficulties in the field those
 
01:25:42.050 --> 01:25:42.060 align:start position:0%
technical difficulties don't exist when
 
01:25:50.290 --> 01:25:50.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:52.669 --> 01:25:52.679 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
01:25:56.090 --> 01:25:56.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:57.709 --> 01:25:57.719 align:start position:0%
has there been any cases of that
 
01:25:57.719 --> 01:25:58.970 align:start position:0%
has there been any cases of that
happening

01:25:58.970 --> 01:25:58.980 align:start position:0%
happening
 
01:26:00.770 --> 01:26:00.780 align:start position:0%
that's a great question
 
01:26:01.850 --> 01:26:01.860 align:start position:0%
um I don't spend my time in the
 
01:26:03.950 --> 01:26:03.960 align:start position:0%
courtroom so I don't know but I can
 
01:26:05.750 --> 01:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
um at least inquire of some of the
 
01:26:07.850 --> 01:26:07.860 align:start position:0%
attorneys that I do know whether that
 
01:26:10.129 --> 01:26:10.139 align:start position:0%
has been the case
 
01:26:12.470 --> 01:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
um the problem is it
 
01:26:15.709 --> 01:26:15.719 align:start position:0%
even if there has been no cases the
 
01:26:18.229 --> 01:26:18.239 align:start position:0%
statutes allow for such a case and it's
 
01:26:20.629 --> 01:26:20.639 align:start position:0%
not a corner case
 
01:26:22.189 --> 01:26:22.199 align:start position:0%
um as you move further north in the
 
01:26:25.330 --> 01:26:25.340 align:start position:0%
state especially above the notch right
 
01:26:27.410 --> 01:26:27.420 align:start position:0%
Fish and Game officers are going to be
 
01:26:29.930 --> 01:26:29.940 align:start position:0%
asked to do more and
 
01:26:31.970 --> 01:26:31.980 align:start position:0%
um we all know there's hiring issues
 
01:26:33.770 --> 01:26:33.780 align:start position:0%
today local police departments are
 
01:26:35.270 --> 01:26:35.280 align:start position:0%
having trouble getting people State
 
01:26:36.649 --> 01:26:36.659 align:start position:0%
Police are having trouble getting people
 
01:26:39.649 --> 01:26:39.659 align:start position:0%
you could imagine a case where
 
01:26:41.270 --> 01:26:41.280 align:start position:0%
a current officer in a different
 
01:26:42.649 --> 01:26:42.659 align:start position:0%
department is going to be called in to
 
01:26:46.570 --> 01:26:46.580 align:start position:0%
do some enforcement and we've allowed a
 
01:26:49.669 --> 01:26:49.679 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional or a case where we can
 
01:26:53.090 --> 01:26:53.100 align:start position:0%
violate the constitution and I think we
 
01:26:55.970 --> 01:26:55.980 align:start position:0%
should leave that sacrifanct our our
 
01:26:57.770 --> 01:26:57.780 align:start position:0%
constitutional protections especially in
 
01:27:01.550 --> 01:27:01.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:02.990 --> 01:27:03.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:07.430 align:start position:0%
thank you
next

01:27:07.430 --> 01:27:07.440 align:start position:0%

advisory committee uh which is a
 
01:27:38.149 --> 01:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
statutory committee and we advise New
 
01:27:40.270 --> 01:27:40.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire fishing game department on
 
01:27:43.189 --> 01:27:43.199 align:start position:0%
marine fisheries and Coastal issues down
 
01:27:45.709 --> 01:27:45.719 align:start position:0%
on the Seacoast
 
01:27:45.719 --> 01:27:48.050 align:start position:0%
on the Seacoast
um

01:27:48.050 --> 01:27:48.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:51.410 --> 01:27:51.420 align:start position:0%
we're we're in opposition to this mainly
 
01:27:53.689 --> 01:27:53.699 align:start position:0%
because we we work very closely with
 
01:27:55.550 --> 01:27:55.560 align:start position:0%
Fish and Game including law enforcement
 
01:27:58.129 --> 01:27:58.139 align:start position:0%
uh they attend all of our meetings we
 
01:27:59.990 --> 01:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
have discussions they tell us what's
 
01:28:02.990 --> 01:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
going on and for those of us that are on
 
01:28:05.450 --> 01:28:05.460 align:start position:0%
the committee uh we're represented by
 
01:28:07.129 --> 01:28:07.139 align:start position:0%
commercial fishermen recreational
 
01:28:11.030 --> 01:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
fishermen Seafood dealers chatter boat
 
01:28:13.189 --> 01:28:13.199 align:start position:0%
fishermen and
 
01:28:15.950 --> 01:28:15.960 align:start position:0%
we know how important it is that the law
 
01:28:17.750 --> 01:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement with Fish and Game have the
 
01:28:21.790 --> 01:28:21.800 align:start position:0%
ability to board votes uh out at sea
 
01:28:24.709 --> 01:28:24.719 align:start position:0%
uh under the conditions that go on out
 
01:28:27.709 --> 01:28:27.719 align:start position:0%
at sea to be able to patrol the Seacoast
 
01:28:31.250 --> 01:28:31.260 align:start position:0%
area and when they observe uh people
 
01:28:33.950 --> 01:28:33.960 align:start position:0%
engaged in activities of harvesting or
 
01:28:36.290 --> 01:28:36.300 align:start position:0%
transporting marine species they need
 
01:28:38.330 --> 01:28:38.340 align:start position:0%
the ability to inspect that those
 
01:28:40.910 --> 01:28:40.920 align:start position:0%
species marine species are highly
 
01:28:40.920 --> 01:28:42.310 align:start position:0%
species marine species are highly
regulated

01:28:42.310 --> 01:28:42.320 align:start position:0%
regulated
 
01:28:46.610 --> 01:28:46.620 align:start position:0%
item here in all of New England and we
 
01:28:48.950 --> 01:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
just think that this would not allow the
 
01:28:52.189 --> 01:28:52.199 align:start position:0%
department to carry out its mission of
 
01:28:54.830 --> 01:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
protecting that species and and carrying
 
01:28:57.530 --> 01:28:57.540 align:start position:0%
out and forcing the regulations that are
 
01:28:59.689 --> 01:28:59.699 align:start position:0%
set in statute and in administrative
 
01:28:59.699 --> 01:29:01.490 align:start position:0%
set in statute and in administrative
rules

01:29:01.490 --> 01:29:01.500 align:start position:0%
rules
 
01:29:03.050 --> 01:29:03.060 align:start position:0%
there are other people that want to
 
01:29:08.510 --> 01:29:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:13.129 --> 01:29:13.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:27.790 --> 01:29:27.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:29.810 --> 01:29:29.820 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you for this

good morning my name is Eric Anderson

thank you for this opportunity to speak
 
01:29:42.470 --> 01:29:42.480 align:start position:0%

01:29:52.910 --> 01:29:52.920 align:start position:0%
um as my other colleagues come forward I
 
01:29:54.470 --> 01:29:54.480 align:start position:0%
think we're all in opposition of this
 
01:29:54.480 --> 01:29:55.729 align:start position:0%
think we're all in opposition of this
bill

01:29:55.729 --> 01:29:55.739 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:29:55.739 --> 01:29:57.830 align:start position:0%
bill
um

01:29:57.830 --> 01:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:01.490 --> 01:30:01.500 align:start position:0%
I've had over 40 years of experience of
 
01:30:04.970 --> 01:30:04.980 align:start position:0%
on the water and and it's with respect
 
01:30:06.590 --> 01:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
and admiration
 
01:30:08.990 --> 01:30:09.000 align:start position:0%
um that I've observed the conduct of New
 
01:30:11.149 --> 01:30:11.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Fish and Game officers they
 
01:30:13.070 --> 01:30:13.080 align:start position:0%
they conduct themselves in a very
 
01:30:15.770 --> 01:30:15.780 align:start position:0%
professional manner
 
01:30:15.780 --> 01:30:16.430 align:start position:0%
professional manner
um

01:30:16.430 --> 01:30:16.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:20.450 --> 01:30:20.460 align:start position:0%
and they do have a difficult job and so
 
01:30:22.610 --> 01:30:22.620 align:start position:0%
having this provision that they've been
 
01:30:25.669 --> 01:30:25.679 align:start position:0%
allowed it's it's been to my knowledge
 
01:30:27.950 --> 01:30:27.960 align:start position:0%
that they've never that they just don't
 
01:30:30.290 --> 01:30:30.300 align:start position:0%
abuse it they recognize the privilege
 
01:30:33.110 --> 01:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
they do not abuse it in any way shape in
 
01:30:34.550 --> 01:30:34.560 align:start position:0%
a manner
 
01:30:37.850 --> 01:30:37.860 align:start position:0%
um and it's a necessary component of
 
01:30:37.860 --> 01:30:38.810 align:start position:0%
um and it's a necessary component of
um

01:30:38.810 --> 01:30:38.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:40.669 --> 01:30:40.679 align:start position:0%
how they were going to enforce and
 
01:30:42.649 --> 01:30:42.659 align:start position:0%
protect our natural resources in the
 
01:30:44.390 --> 01:30:44.400 align:start position:0%
state especially on the water I think
 
01:30:46.729 --> 01:30:46.739 align:start position:0%
you've you've heard the description of
 
01:30:50.030 --> 01:30:50.040 align:start position:0%
you know the difficulty of what the what
 
01:30:52.070 --> 01:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
what what it would entail to get a
 
01:30:54.970 --> 01:30:54.980 align:start position:0%
warrant while they are on the water and
 
01:30:58.970 --> 01:30:58.980 align:start position:0%
the the operational problems it would
 
01:31:01.970 --> 01:31:01.980 align:start position:0%
that would be created by that
 
01:31:01.980 --> 01:31:03.050 align:start position:0%
that would be created by that
um

01:31:03.050 --> 01:31:03.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:05.209 --> 01:31:05.219 align:start position:0%
I've scratched a lot of hair off my head
 
01:31:07.129 --> 01:31:07.139 align:start position:0%
as you can see through the course of my
 
01:31:08.810 --> 01:31:08.820 align:start position:0%
time I can relate and I'm just
 
01:31:11.689 --> 01:31:11.699 align:start position:0%
bewildered that that this is not the
 
01:31:13.910 --> 01:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
first time or occasion that we've come
 
01:31:16.970 --> 01:31:16.980 align:start position:0%
before this you know come to Concord to
 
01:31:19.669 --> 01:31:19.679 align:start position:0%
oppose this to oppose this type of Bill
 
01:31:22.310 --> 01:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
and I think you have to um
 
01:31:24.410 --> 01:31:24.420 align:start position:0%
you have to give you know the New
 
01:31:26.390 --> 01:31:26.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Fish and Game officers every
 
01:31:29.030 --> 01:31:29.040 align:start position:0%

01:31:29.040 --> 01:31:30.830 align:start position:0%
ability to do their job under difficult
situations

01:31:30.830 --> 01:31:30.840 align:start position:0%

01:31:37.149 --> 01:31:37.159 align:start position:0%
give you a testimony
 
01:31:55.570 --> 01:31:55.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:57.649 --> 01:31:57.659 align:start position:0%

the record as opposing this piece of
 
01:32:47.580 --> 01:32:48.950 align:start position:0%
the record as opposing this piece of
legislation

01:32:48.950 --> 01:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:32:51.229 --> 01:32:51.239 align:start position:0%
um uh I read them out loud simply
 
01:32:52.430 --> 01:32:52.440 align:start position:0%
because we are the regulative community
 
01:32:54.290 --> 01:32:54.300 align:start position:0%
the community that interacts with fish
 
01:32:56.149 --> 01:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
and game on a daily basis
 
01:32:57.770 --> 01:32:57.780 align:start position:0%
and we have some strong concerns about
 
01:32:59.390 --> 01:32:59.400 align:start position:0%
this piece of legislation as we see it
 
01:33:02.629 --> 01:33:02.639 align:start position:0%
as uh a removal of the collaboration
 
01:33:04.729 --> 01:33:04.739 align:start position:0%
that our organizations have had with the
 
01:33:07.010 --> 01:33:07.020 align:start position:0%
department for many years and decades
 
01:33:09.050 --> 01:33:09.060 align:start position:0%
um leave back to the 30s when this
 
01:33:12.110 --> 01:33:12.120 align:start position:0%
statute was put in place we see this
 
01:33:13.490 --> 01:33:13.500 align:start position:0%
bill as a way to that would increase
 
01:33:16.910 --> 01:33:16.920 align:start position:0%
potential poaching in New Hampshire and
 
01:33:18.950 --> 01:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
potential other high levels of risk that
 
01:33:21.169 --> 01:33:21.179 align:start position:0%
would put together that would risk the
 
01:33:23.810 --> 01:33:23.820 align:start position:0%
record populations and strong habitats
 
01:33:25.669 --> 01:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
we have in New Hampshire uh the last
 
01:33:27.290 --> 01:33:27.300 align:start position:0%
multiple Years you'll hear from folks
 
01:33:29.090 --> 01:33:29.100 align:start position:0%
behind me we've had record deer seasons
 
01:33:31.010 --> 01:33:31.020 align:start position:0%
record bear seasons record turkey
 
01:33:32.689 --> 01:33:32.699 align:start position:0%
seasons um you know there was a time
 
01:33:34.070 --> 01:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
where we had no turkeys left in New
 
01:33:35.149 --> 01:33:35.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire where there's a time we had no
 
01:33:37.430 --> 01:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
beavers left in New Hampshire and it's
 
01:33:39.110 --> 01:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
the sportsmen working together with fish
 
01:33:41.390 --> 01:33:41.400 align:start position:0%
and game that's allowed these
 
01:33:43.189 --> 01:33:43.199 align:start position:0%
populations to rebound and the habitats
 
01:33:44.709 --> 01:33:44.719 align:start position:0%
to continue to be able to support them
 
01:33:46.850 --> 01:33:46.860 align:start position:0%
so with that I want to be very
 
01:33:47.990 --> 01:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
respectful of your time there's a lot of
 
01:33:50.629 --> 01:33:50.639 align:start position:0%
folks here to speak but I encourage you
 
01:33:52.129 --> 01:33:52.139 align:start position:0%
to reach out to any of these
 
01:33:53.830 --> 01:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
organizations if you have more specific
 
01:33:57.229 --> 01:33:57.239 align:start position:0%
questions about sort of their impact in
 
01:33:59.030 --> 01:33:59.040 align:start position:0%
opposition to the Bell but I'm happy to

where I'm way over capitalized in the
 
01:35:02.930 --> 01:35:02.940 align:start position:0%
fishing industry and I can't imagine
 
01:35:04.729 --> 01:35:04.739 align:start position:0%
you're taking enforcement things away
 
01:35:06.950 --> 01:35:06.960 align:start position:0%
from the game wardens I thought they
 
01:35:09.590 --> 01:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
used to be federally deputized the game
 
01:35:10.910 --> 01:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
one to my friends are the only
 
01:35:12.770 --> 01:35:12.780 align:start position:0%
protection I have
 
01:35:15.169 --> 01:35:15.179 align:start position:0%
and it scares me to think
 
01:35:16.970 --> 01:35:16.980 align:start position:0%
we're talking about you talk about trap
 
01:35:19.490 --> 01:35:19.500 align:start position:0%
numbers you people don't realize how
 
01:35:22.669 --> 01:35:22.679 align:start position:0%
expensive our traps are it makes no
 
01:35:25.790 --> 01:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
sense to me what I do when my I don't
 
01:35:27.770 --> 01:35:27.780 align:start position:0%
fish 1200 traps anymore you have a 1200
 
01:35:30.169 --> 01:35:30.179 align:start position:0%
trap license lobster traps now are over
 
01:35:32.270 --> 01:35:32.280 align:start position:0%
150 a piece
 
01:35:34.010 --> 01:35:34.020 align:start position:0%
the only protection I have is the game
 
01:35:36.410 --> 01:35:36.420 align:start position:0%
wardens I remember the Wild and Woolly
 
01:35:37.790 --> 01:35:37.800 align:start position:0%
days when I started you people don't
 
01:35:39.169 --> 01:35:39.179 align:start position:0%
ever want to see that come back again
 
01:35:41.810 --> 01:35:41.820 align:start position:0%
but we the game wants to eat all the
 
01:35:43.310 --> 01:35:43.320 align:start position:0%
enforcement rights you can give them
 
01:35:46.070 --> 01:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
state waters and federal waters I mean
 
01:35:47.689 --> 01:35:47.699 align:start position:0%
it's it's we're not talking about
 
01:35:49.910 --> 01:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
catching one more trout of this and then
 
01:35:52.490 --> 01:35:52.500 align:start position:0%
lobster fishing is the only economical
 
01:35:54.290 --> 01:35:54.300 align:start position:0%
viable business left in New Hampshire
 
01:35:56.030 --> 01:35:56.040 align:start position:0%
there are a few young people getting
 
01:35:57.830 --> 01:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
into it and need all the protection you
 
01:35:59.689 --> 01:35:59.699 align:start position:0%
can give them it's the only thing people
 
01:36:01.189 --> 01:36:01.199 align:start position:0%
got left to do
 
01:36:02.930 --> 01:36:02.940 align:start position:0%
and there's some serious issues in the
 
01:36:04.610 --> 01:36:04.620 align:start position:0%
lobster history right now but we need
 
01:36:06.709 --> 01:36:06.719 align:start position:0%
all the protection we can get
 
01:36:09.050 --> 01:36:09.060 align:start position:0%
thank you very much if any questions I'd
 
01:36:14.270 --> 01:36:14.280 align:start position:0%

01:36:16.129 --> 01:36:16.139 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:36:18.290 --> 01:36:18.300 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my
 
01:36:19.910 --> 01:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for the work you do
 
01:36:23.050 --> 01:36:23.060 align:start position:0%
and and for supporting sustainable
 
01:36:25.970 --> 01:36:25.980 align:start position:0%
sustaining fishing practices I'm curious
 
01:36:29.450 --> 01:36:29.460 align:start position:0%
if if this were to be enacted and you
 
01:36:31.910 --> 01:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
were out or about to head out to to go
 
01:36:34.610 --> 01:36:34.620 align:start position:0%
check your traps and were held back for
 
01:36:36.410 --> 01:36:36.420 align:start position:0%
however long it took to get a warrant
 
01:36:38.510 --> 01:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
what would that do as in terms of an
 
01:36:40.070 --> 01:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
impact or if you were out at Sea and
 
01:36:42.470 --> 01:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
stopped for for checking for and had to
 
01:36:44.870 --> 01:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
wait several hours for enforcement it's
 
01:36:44.880 --> 01:36:46.790 align:start position:0%
wait several hours for enforcement it's
ridiculous

01:36:46.790 --> 01:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
ridiculous
 
01:36:49.070 --> 01:36:49.080 align:start position:0%
it's really ridiculous like I can't
 
01:36:51.770 --> 01:36:51.780 align:start position:0%
imagine anybody's proposing this we're a
 
01:36:53.270 --> 01:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
business you know it's like anyone else
 
01:36:54.830 --> 01:36:54.840 align:start position:0%
you start in the morning you have to
 
01:36:56.810 --> 01:36:56.820 align:start position:0%
produce every day and to stop someone
 
01:36:59.149 --> 01:36:59.159 align:start position:0%
for any period of time just because you
 
01:37:01.310 --> 01:37:01.320 align:start position:0%
want to stop them that's ridiculous you
 
01:37:02.510 --> 01:37:02.520 align:start position:0%
know our days are very limited
 
01:37:04.790 --> 01:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
weather-wise opportunities we have to
 
01:37:07.370 --> 01:37:07.380 align:start position:0%
complete the day the ones
 
01:37:09.470 --> 01:37:09.480 align:start position:0%
they're friends of mine they come aboard
 
01:37:11.030 --> 01:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
my boat anytime they want they've never
 
01:37:12.649 --> 01:37:12.659 align:start position:0%
held me up for any reason
 
01:37:14.649 --> 01:37:14.659 align:start position:0%
Fallout for clarification
 
01:37:18.050 --> 01:37:18.060 align:start position:0%
what I meant is if if this were passed
 
01:37:21.290 --> 01:37:21.300 align:start position:0%
and you had to wait two hours while they
 
01:37:22.970 --> 01:37:22.980 align:start position:0%
obtained a warrant
 
01:37:25.910 --> 01:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
how would that impact what happened to
 
01:37:27.830 --> 01:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
your business it would be terrible I'd
 
01:37:29.870 --> 01:37:29.880 align:start position:0%
lose 25 or 30 of my income that
 
01:37:32.090 --> 01:37:32.100 align:start position:0%
particular day we don't we don't get
 
01:37:32.100 --> 01:37:32.930 align:start position:0%
particular day we don't we don't get
paid

01:37:32.930 --> 01:37:32.940 align:start position:0%
paid
 
01:37:34.970 --> 01:37:34.980 align:start position:0%
trying to make a point here we don't get
 
01:37:36.649 --> 01:37:36.659 align:start position:0%
paid for being there
 
01:37:39.290 --> 01:37:39.300 align:start position:0%
I get paid every day for what goes on
 
01:37:41.330 --> 01:37:41.340 align:start position:0%
the scale to a tenth of a pound
 
01:37:43.610 --> 01:37:43.620 align:start position:0%
if I caught 100 pounds yesterday if that
 
01:37:45.830 --> 01:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
so be it if I don't go today at zero if
 
01:37:47.870 --> 01:37:47.880 align:start position:0%
I go get 50 pounds
 
01:37:49.850 --> 01:37:49.860 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what goes on the scale we
 
01:37:51.649 --> 01:37:51.659 align:start position:0%
get paid every day for what goes on the
 
01:37:53.030 --> 01:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
scale we don't get paid for being there
 
01:37:55.310 --> 01:37:55.320 align:start position:0%
we don't get paid for sick days holidays
 
01:37:58.129 --> 01:37:58.139 align:start position:0%
vacations we get paid to produce that's
 
01:37:58.139 --> 01:38:00.770 align:start position:0%
vacations we get paid to produce that's
it

01:38:00.770 --> 01:38:00.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:02.450 --> 01:38:02.460 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:38:07.250 --> 01:38:07.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:18.229 --> 01:38:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:22.310 --> 01:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:25.310 --> 01:38:25.320 align:start position:0%
I can't claim 67 years I've only got 60
 
01:38:28.610 --> 01:38:28.620 align:start position:0%
plus I'm the Junior
 
01:38:28.620 --> 01:38:29.390 align:start position:0%
plus I'm the Junior
um

01:38:29.390 --> 01:38:29.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:30.890 --> 01:38:30.900 align:start position:0%
decided with me if you're three years
 
01:38:35.209 --> 01:38:35.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:38.930 --> 01:38:38.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:41.570 --> 01:38:41.580 align:start position:0%
no as my brother said we we've seen the
 
01:38:43.910 --> 01:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
the best and the worst of it
 
01:38:43.920 --> 01:38:46.430 align:start position:0%
the best and the worst of it
um

01:38:46.430 --> 01:38:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:48.890 --> 01:38:48.900 align:start position:0%
the wardens are necessary
 
01:38:51.470 --> 01:38:51.480 align:start position:0%
part of our occupation
 
01:38:51.480 --> 01:38:52.250 align:start position:0%
part of our occupation
um

01:38:52.250 --> 01:38:52.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:55.310 --> 01:38:55.320 align:start position:0%
I would hate to see them handcuffed
 
01:38:58.010 --> 01:38:58.020 align:start position:0%
I trust them to be professional and to
 
01:39:00.290 --> 01:39:00.300 align:start position:0%
do what they believe is right
 
01:39:03.229 --> 01:39:03.239 align:start position:0%
like any profession there there are bad
 
01:39:03.239 --> 01:39:04.250 align:start position:0%
like any profession there there are bad
apples

01:39:04.250 --> 01:39:04.260 align:start position:0%
apples
 
01:39:06.470 --> 01:39:06.480 align:start position:0%
but they all aren't bad apples if you
 
01:39:07.850 --> 01:39:07.860 align:start position:0%
find a bad apple you deal with it
 
01:39:07.860 --> 01:39:09.890 align:start position:0%
find a bad apple you deal with it
individually

01:39:09.890 --> 01:39:09.900 align:start position:0%
individually
 
01:39:09.900 --> 01:39:11.090 align:start position:0%
individually
um

01:39:11.090 --> 01:39:11.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:13.490 --> 01:39:13.500 align:start position:0%
I've spoken well
 
01:39:15.649 --> 01:39:15.659 align:start position:0%
because of where we fish we're subject
 
01:39:18.169 --> 01:39:18.179 align:start position:0%
to three different sets of laws we're
 
01:39:20.330 --> 01:39:20.340 align:start position:0%
subject to Federal Regulation
 
01:39:22.610 --> 01:39:22.620 align:start position:0%
we're subject to Maine regulation and
 
01:39:23.570 --> 01:39:23.580 align:start position:0%
we're subject to New Hampshire
 
01:39:23.580 --> 01:39:25.850 align:start position:0%
we're subject to New Hampshire
regulation

01:39:25.850 --> 01:39:25.860 align:start position:0%
regulation
 
01:39:28.850 --> 01:39:28.860 align:start position:0%
so idea say
 
01:39:30.830 --> 01:39:30.840 align:start position:0%
there's probably no industry in this
 
01:39:32.450 --> 01:39:32.460 align:start position:0%
country that's as highly regulated as
 
01:39:36.229 --> 01:39:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:39.110 --> 01:39:39.120 align:start position:0%
if we are left to enforce those
 
01:39:41.570 --> 01:39:41.580 align:start position:0%
regulations on our own we go back to the
 
01:39:43.070 --> 01:39:43.080 align:start position:0%
law of the jungle
 
01:39:44.450 --> 01:39:44.460 align:start position:0%
that's not going to be good for anybody
 
01:39:46.250 --> 01:39:46.260 align:start position:0%
as my brother said we're we're all over
 
01:39:46.260 --> 01:39:47.810 align:start position:0%
as my brother said we're we're all over
capitalized

01:39:47.810 --> 01:39:47.820 align:start position:0%
capitalized
 
01:39:49.970 --> 01:39:49.980 align:start position:0%
we can't afford to do that we've got too
 
01:39:51.229 --> 01:39:51.239 align:start position:0%
much to lose
 
01:39:53.750 --> 01:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
so we depend on the wardens to be out
 
01:39:55.729 --> 01:39:55.739 align:start position:0%
there be visible
 
01:39:57.410 --> 01:39:57.420 align:start position:0%
just their presence and the the
 
01:40:00.470 --> 01:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
visibility is a big part of their job if
 
01:40:01.729 --> 01:40:01.739 align:start position:0%
people see them and know they're out
 
01:40:05.750 --> 01:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
there that's almost as good as boarding
 
01:40:08.390 --> 01:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
if they suspect something there's some
 
01:40:10.370 --> 01:40:10.380 align:start position:0%
issue I encourage them to board
 
01:40:10.380 --> 01:40:11.870 align:start position:0%
issue I encourage them to board
immediately

01:40:11.870 --> 01:40:11.880 align:start position:0%
immediately
 
01:40:15.350 --> 01:40:15.360 align:start position:0%
where we are in the weather conditions
 
01:40:17.030 --> 01:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
I don't want to lay there for three or
 
01:40:19.669 --> 01:40:19.679 align:start position:0%
four hours freshen my ass off waiting
 
01:40:22.669 --> 01:40:22.679 align:start position:0%
for somebody to come get get the warrant
 
01:40:26.629 --> 01:40:26.639 align:start position:0%
um it's it's dangerous it's unproductive
 
01:40:26.639 --> 01:40:27.890 align:start position:0%
um it's it's dangerous it's unproductive
um

01:40:27.890 --> 01:40:27.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:30.350 --> 01:40:30.360 align:start position:0%
I'm afraid if you take disability away
 
01:40:32.149 --> 01:40:32.159 align:start position:0%
from them what's going to happen next
 
01:40:34.250 --> 01:40:34.260 align:start position:0%
are we going to put them
 
01:40:35.510 --> 01:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
we're going to take their patrol
 
01:40:37.610 --> 01:40:37.620 align:start position:0%
Vehicles away and put them in roller
 
01:40:39.709 --> 01:40:39.719 align:start position:0%
skates and paddle boards I mean you
 
01:40:41.930 --> 01:40:41.940 align:start position:0%
can't limit their ability to do their
 
01:40:41.940 --> 01:40:43.189 align:start position:0%
can't limit their ability to do their
job

01:40:43.189 --> 01:40:43.199 align:start position:0%
job
 
01:40:46.010 --> 01:40:46.020 align:start position:0%
so I would encourage you to
 
01:40:49.370 --> 01:40:49.380 align:start position:0%
to reject this proposal
 
01:40:52.010 --> 01:40:52.020 align:start position:0%
they have a very unique job and a very
 
01:40:52.020 --> 01:40:52.970 align:start position:0%
they have a very unique job and a very
unique

01:40:52.970 --> 01:40:52.980 align:start position:0%
unique
 
01:40:52.980 --> 01:40:54.830 align:start position:0%
unique
conditions

01:40:54.830 --> 01:40:54.840 align:start position:0%
conditions
 
01:40:56.570 --> 01:40:56.580 align:start position:0%
I think that needs to be recognized and
 
01:40:58.129 --> 01:40:58.139 align:start position:0%
give them the latitude to do their job
 
01:41:00.410 --> 01:41:00.420 align:start position:0%
so we in the industry certainly
 
01:41:03.890 --> 01:41:03.900 align:start position:0%
appreciate it and as I say without it it
 
01:41:05.330 --> 01:41:05.340 align:start position:0%
goes back to the law of the Jungle and
 
01:41:07.370 --> 01:41:07.380 align:start position:0%
that's going to be bad for everybody
 
01:41:09.350 --> 01:41:09.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:41:16.010 --> 01:41:16.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:23.030 --> 01:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:23.040 --> 01:41:25.090 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:41:25.090 --> 01:41:25.100 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:41:28.669 --> 01:41:28.679 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman committee members
 
01:41:30.890 --> 01:41:30.900 align:start position:0%
my name is Aubry Friedman I'm from
 
01:41:34.490 --> 01:41:34.500 align:start position:0%
Bridgewater private citizen I speak in
 
01:41:37.189 --> 01:41:37.199 align:start position:0%
support of this bill this is an
 
01:41:40.310 --> 01:41:40.320 align:start position:0%
anti-snooping bill and I think it's a
 
01:41:42.830 --> 01:41:42.840 align:start position:0%
good idea whenever there's a question
 
01:41:46.070 --> 01:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
about privacy the burden of proof should
 
01:41:49.189 --> 01:41:49.199 align:start position:0%
always be on government officials to
 
01:41:51.830 --> 01:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
explain what they're going to do and
 
01:41:53.870 --> 01:41:53.880 align:start position:0%
they can still get the warrant that just
 
01:41:56.689 --> 01:41:56.699 align:start position:0%
puts an extra set of eyes on what you're
 
01:41:58.310 --> 01:41:58.320 align:start position:0%
doing it doesn't stop them from doing
 
01:42:00.470 --> 01:42:00.480 align:start position:0%
their job and by the way so it was
 
01:42:03.169 --> 01:42:03.179 align:start position:0%
mentioned there will be a big delay if
 
01:42:05.629 --> 01:42:05.639 align:start position:0%
somebody requests it well also the
 
01:42:07.609 --> 01:42:07.619 align:start position:0%
person who's going to request the
 
01:42:09.290 --> 01:42:09.300 align:start position:0%
warrant they're going to be
 
01:42:12.590 --> 01:42:12.600 align:start position:0%
inconvenienced for a couple hours too so
 
01:42:15.649 --> 01:42:15.659 align:start position:0%
I think if they're doing it uh there's a
 
01:42:17.330 --> 01:42:17.340 align:start position:0%
you know there's a reason for it it's
 
01:42:18.950 --> 01:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
going to be a big inconvenience for them
 
01:42:22.189 --> 01:42:22.199 align:start position:0%
too so we should consider that also
 
01:42:24.609 --> 01:42:24.619 align:start position:0%
um the current law
 
01:42:28.310 --> 01:42:28.320 align:start position:0%
it invites selective enforcement and
 
01:42:30.410 --> 01:42:30.420 align:start position:0%
possible corruption it's always good to
 
01:42:33.709 --> 01:42:33.719 align:start position:0%
have that extra set of eyes uh for a
 
01:42:36.290 --> 01:42:36.300 align:start position:0%
judge to uh just looking over your
 
01:42:38.629 --> 01:42:38.639 align:start position:0%
shoulder doesn't stop anything anybody
 
01:42:41.870 --> 01:42:41.880 align:start position:0%
from doing your job but actually it
 
01:42:43.090 --> 01:42:43.100 align:start position:0%
protects you if you do anything
 
01:42:45.350 --> 01:42:45.360 align:start position:0%
inappropriate you could say well the
 
01:42:46.910 --> 01:42:46.920 align:start position:0%
judge okayed it so it's actually a
 
01:42:48.649 --> 01:42:48.659 align:start position:0%
little bit protection for the officer if
 
01:42:51.169 --> 01:42:51.179 align:start position:0%
you think about it too was already
 
01:42:54.229 --> 01:42:54.239 align:start position:0%
mentioned Article 19 I'll just quote
 
01:42:57.830 --> 01:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
here it codifies that a warrant Article
 
01:42:59.990 --> 01:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
19 from part one of the New Hampshire
 
01:43:02.930 --> 01:43:02.940 align:start position:0%
Constitution Bill of Rights warrant must
 
01:43:06.590 --> 01:43:06.600 align:start position:0%
be issued to protect quote right to be
 
01:43:09.530 --> 01:43:09.540 align:start position:0%
secure from all reasonable searches and
 
01:43:12.830 --> 01:43:12.840 align:start position:0%
seizures of his person his houses his
 
01:43:16.910 --> 01:43:16.920 align:start position:0%
papers and all his possessions and again
 
01:43:19.910 --> 01:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
I say when it comes to law why is this
 
01:43:21.950 --> 01:43:21.960 align:start position:0%
one different than all other Law
 
01:43:25.669 --> 01:43:25.679 align:start position:0%
Officers we have to uh the same rules
 
01:43:27.189 --> 01:43:27.199 align:start position:0%
should apply to all
 
01:43:29.990 --> 01:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
I also like the wording they changed it
 
01:43:32.950 --> 01:43:32.960 align:start position:0%
from reasonable and articulate
 
01:43:36.790 --> 01:43:36.800 align:start position:0%
articulable suspicion to probable cause
 
01:43:40.490 --> 01:43:40.500 align:start position:0%
uh again it's privacy protection for the
 
01:43:42.490 --> 01:43:42.500 align:start position:0%
individual when there's any question
 
01:43:46.970 --> 01:43:46.980 align:start position:0%
private privacy versus uh you know the
 
01:43:49.490 --> 01:43:49.500 align:start position:0%
common good or the public I'm always
 
01:43:52.310 --> 01:43:52.320 align:start position:0%
more in favor of privacy protection for
 
01:43:54.350 --> 01:43:54.360 align:start position:0%
the individual
 
01:43:54.360 --> 01:43:54.950 align:start position:0%
the individual
um

01:43:54.950 --> 01:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:57.890 --> 01:43:57.900 align:start position:0%
and that's it um any questions
 
01:44:00.830 --> 01:44:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:03.530 --> 01:44:03.540 align:start position:0%
oh and I have a
 
01:44:05.090 --> 01:44:05.100 align:start position:0%
alternative okay if you have something
 
01:44:07.070 --> 01:44:07.080 align:start position:0%
you'd like to share you can
 
01:44:08.629 --> 01:44:08.639 align:start position:0%
um I I just have a quick question have
 
01:44:10.490 --> 01:44:10.500 align:start position:0%
you have you considered
 
01:44:14.890 --> 01:44:14.900 align:start position:0%
that there's no right per se to to fish
 
01:44:17.570 --> 01:44:17.580 align:start position:0%
that's granted by by the state the state
 
01:44:19.790 --> 01:44:19.800 align:start position:0%
controls the fishing it's license when
 
01:44:22.189 --> 01:44:22.199 align:start position:0%
you enter the same as when you you buy a
 
01:44:24.709 --> 01:44:24.719 align:start position:0%
concert ticket you enter into a contract
 
01:44:27.590 --> 01:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
with the owner that says I I will go to
 
01:44:29.270 --> 01:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
your concert but you can search my stuff
 
01:44:31.430 --> 01:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
going in when you obtain a fishing
 
01:44:33.229 --> 01:44:33.239 align:start position:0%
license do you not think that that might
 
01:44:36.109 --> 01:44:36.119 align:start position:0%
also be a conditional waiver of some of
 
01:44:38.330 --> 01:44:38.340 align:start position:0%
your rights in exchange for your ability
 
01:44:39.709 --> 01:44:39.719 align:start position:0%
to fish
 
01:44:42.830 --> 01:44:42.840 align:start position:0%
uh privacy rights have you specifically
 
01:44:44.450 --> 01:44:44.460 align:start position:0%
given them up
 
01:44:46.790 --> 01:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
that's my question do you I don't think
 
01:44:51.169 --> 01:44:51.179 align:start position:0%
so I think privacy is is key and it's
 
01:44:53.330 --> 01:44:53.340 align:start position:0%
clear here in the Constitution and I
 
01:44:55.729 --> 01:44:55.739 align:start position:0%
think just in reasonableness
 
01:44:59.149 --> 01:44:59.159 align:start position:0%
if somebody's going to search you a
 
01:45:00.830 --> 01:45:00.840 align:start position:0%
government official who's got police
 
01:45:03.830 --> 01:45:03.840 align:start position:0%
power uh that's not something you give
 
01:45:07.189 --> 01:45:07.199 align:start position:0%
up automatically uh
 
01:45:09.590 --> 01:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
it should be with you always as far as
 
01:45:13.550 --> 01:45:13.560 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned okay representative Newell
 
01:45:15.590 --> 01:45:15.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:45:17.270 --> 01:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:45:19.970 --> 01:45:19.980 align:start position:0%
um I think the way that I'm hearing it
 
01:45:21.290 --> 01:45:21.300 align:start position:0%
from you is that this is a matter of
 
01:45:24.590 --> 01:45:24.600 align:start position:0%
principle and and I'm wondering if you I
 
01:45:26.450 --> 01:45:26.460 align:start position:0%
I you have
 
01:45:28.490 --> 01:45:28.500 align:start position:0%
um explained that the potential for
 
01:45:30.950 --> 01:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
abuse but I I just was wondering if you
 
01:45:33.470 --> 01:45:33.480 align:start position:0%
have any examples of actual instances
 
01:45:36.350 --> 01:45:36.360 align:start position:0%
where it has been abused no I do not I
 
01:45:38.629 --> 01:45:38.639 align:start position:0%
agree it's it's a principle to me and
 
01:45:40.310 --> 01:45:40.320 align:start position:0%
that that's why I'm here testifying for
 
01:45:43.550 --> 01:45:43.560 align:start position:0%
principle privacy protection versus
 
01:45:47.990 --> 01:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
police power I mean it's um any any
 
01:45:50.750 --> 01:45:50.760 align:start position:0%
question on that I weigh more inside on
 
01:45:53.450 --> 01:45:53.460 align:start position:0%
the size of privacy and that's why you
 
01:45:54.770 --> 01:45:54.780 align:start position:0%
have to have the warrant so it's a
 
01:45:57.950 --> 01:45:57.960 align:start position:0%
principal thing thank you
 
01:45:59.510 --> 01:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony this
 
01:45:59.520 --> 01:46:03.290 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony this
morning

01:46:03.290 --> 01:46:03.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:19.490 --> 01:46:19.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:19.500 --> 01:46:20.930 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:46:20.930 --> 01:46:20.940 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:46:23.330 --> 01:46:23.340 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman and members of
 
01:46:24.890 --> 01:46:24.900 align:start position:0%
the committee thank you for the
 
01:46:27.169 --> 01:46:27.179 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify this morning my
 
01:46:29.330 --> 01:46:29.340 align:start position:0%
name is Eric ORF I'm a wildlife
 
01:46:31.070 --> 01:46:31.080 align:start position:0%
biologist and have been a wildlife
 
01:46:33.169 --> 01:46:33.179 align:start position:0%
biologist here in New Hampshire for a
 
01:46:35.930 --> 01:46:35.940 align:start position:0%
half century now my tact will be a
 
01:46:37.189 --> 01:46:37.199 align:start position:0%
little different today I think the
 
01:46:39.169 --> 01:46:39.179 align:start position:0%
colonel will be able to explain the
 
01:46:41.870 --> 01:46:41.880 align:start position:0%
semantics and the uh in the particular
 
01:46:44.390 --> 01:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
mechanics of this legislation but I'm
 
01:46:46.070 --> 01:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
here this morning representing the New
 
01:46:49.669 --> 01:46:49.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Audubon and like Mr Baker the
 
01:46:51.410 --> 01:46:51.420 align:start position:0%
uh the New Hampshire wild Refrigeration
 
01:46:53.750 --> 01:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
I first joined the Wally Federation as a
 
01:46:56.629 --> 01:46:56.639 align:start position:0%
junior member in 1964. I've been on the
 
01:46:58.970 --> 01:46:58.980 align:start position:0%
board for several decades and the vice
 
01:47:01.790 --> 01:47:01.800 align:start position:0%
president for several years now the New
 
01:47:03.830 --> 01:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Wally Federation is the voice
 
01:47:05.930 --> 01:47:05.940 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire Sports women and men
 
01:47:07.850 --> 01:47:07.860 align:start position:0%
and has been so for nearly a hundred
 
01:47:09.890 --> 01:47:09.900 align:start position:0%
years the New Hampshire Audubon have
 
01:47:12.050 --> 01:47:12.060 align:start position:0%
been on their policy committee and I
 
01:47:13.669 --> 01:47:13.679 align:start position:0%
submitted to the clerk some written
 
01:47:16.910 --> 01:47:16.920 align:start position:0%
testimony earlier but uh back to the
 
01:47:19.129 --> 01:47:19.139 align:start position:0%
Wildlife Federation if we cast our eyes
 
01:47:21.470 --> 01:47:21.480 align:start position:0%
out the window right now it looks like
 
01:47:24.410 --> 01:47:24.420 align:start position:0%
winter but you know bald eagles are
 
01:47:26.629 --> 01:47:26.639 align:start position:0%
setting up their territory senior Barrel
 
01:47:28.910 --> 01:47:28.920 align:start position:0%
just at New Hampshire Audubon tells me
 
01:47:32.209 --> 01:47:32.219 align:start position:0%
last year there were 92 pairs of bald
 
01:47:34.250 --> 01:47:34.260 align:start position:0%
eagles when I first became a biologist
 
01:47:36.410 --> 01:47:36.420 align:start position:0%
there were zero
 
01:47:38.570 --> 01:47:38.580 align:start position:0%
we have two dozen pairs of peregrine
 
01:47:42.830 --> 01:47:42.840 align:start position:0%
falcons here in New Hampshire turkeys I
 
01:47:44.450 --> 01:47:44.460 align:start position:0%
work for a fish and game as a wildlife
 
01:47:46.370 --> 01:47:46.380 align:start position:0%
biologist for over three decades until I
 
01:47:49.070 --> 01:47:49.080 align:start position:0%
retired in 07 and was recruited by the
 
01:47:50.570 --> 01:47:50.580 align:start position:0%
national wildly Federation to do some
 
01:47:51.890 --> 01:47:51.900 align:start position:0%
Consulting for them you know the Ranger
 
01:47:54.169 --> 01:47:54.179 align:start position:0%
Rick folks so uh but what have I
 
01:47:56.209 --> 01:47:56.219 align:start position:0%
witnessed over that last 50 years bald
 
01:47:59.090 --> 01:47:59.100 align:start position:0%
eagle zero to Chris says likely 100
 
01:48:01.430 --> 01:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
pairs this year peregrine falcons like
 
01:48:04.850 --> 01:48:04.860 align:start position:0%
never before turkeys who hasn't seen a
 
01:48:06.830 --> 01:48:06.840 align:start position:0%
turkey in this room this week There's 50
 
01:48:08.810 --> 01:48:08.820 align:start position:0%
000 turkeys up from zero when I was
 
01:48:11.450 --> 01:48:11.460 align:start position:0%
first there so we have a preponderance
 
01:48:14.109 --> 01:48:14.119 align:start position:0%
of fish and wildlife in New Hampshire
 
01:48:18.109 --> 01:48:18.119 align:start position:0%
and uh you know and and it's been a team
 
01:48:19.609 --> 01:48:19.619 align:start position:0%
effort you know my 30 years at
 
01:48:21.709 --> 01:48:21.719 align:start position:0%
fishingham worked very closely with the
 
01:48:23.270 --> 01:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
law enforcement division it's a team
 
01:48:26.870 --> 01:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
effort every tool makes a difference and
 
01:48:29.510 --> 01:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
it has been productive we have more fish
 
01:48:31.850 --> 01:48:31.860 align:start position:0%
and wildlife in this state than in a
 
01:48:33.830 --> 01:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
couple hundred years it's been very
 
01:48:37.669 --> 01:48:37.679 align:start position:0%
fruitful and and effective and is now
 
01:48:41.030 --> 01:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
enjoyed by the majority of our citizens
 
01:48:43.189 --> 01:48:43.199 align:start position:0%
and those to come that have yet to be
 
01:48:45.950 --> 01:48:45.960 align:start position:0%
born I'm sure but we've all been in the
 
01:48:48.649 --> 01:48:48.659 align:start position:0%
uh the grocery store aisle and you see
 
01:48:50.270 --> 01:48:50.280 align:start position:0%
the young family ahead of us and the
 
01:48:52.010 --> 01:48:52.020 align:start position:0%
child reaches out for the candy and the
 
01:48:54.530 --> 01:48:54.540 align:start position:0%
mother says no well I just told you we
 
01:48:55.790 --> 01:48:55.800 align:start position:0%
have more
 
01:48:58.129 --> 01:48:58.139 align:start position:0%
deer up from forty thousand to a hundred
 
01:48:59.990 --> 01:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
thousand Bears I was the bear biologist
 
01:49:01.850 --> 01:49:01.860 align:start position:0%
when there was a thousand Bears now
 
01:49:04.669 --> 01:49:04.679 align:start position:0%
there's over six thousand wow
 
01:49:06.709 --> 01:49:06.719 align:start position:0%
it becomes a little more tempting to
 
01:49:08.270 --> 01:49:08.280 align:start position:0%
take things when they're abundant
 
01:49:12.590 --> 01:49:12.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't it so we need the regulations
 
01:49:15.050 --> 01:49:15.060 align:start position:0%
and laws that have been very effective
 
01:49:17.689 --> 01:49:17.699 align:start position:0%
for the last 50 years to pass this bill
 
01:49:19.370 --> 01:49:19.380 align:start position:0%
would they go backwards we don't want to
 
01:49:21.470 --> 01:49:21.480 align:start position:0%
go backwards we have momentum and I
 
01:49:23.810 --> 01:49:23.820 align:start position:0%
think we should maintain that momentum I
 
01:49:25.970 --> 01:49:25.980 align:start position:0%
would ask the committee members here to
 
01:49:27.950 --> 01:49:27.960 align:start position:0%
vote this bill and expedient to
 
01:49:31.790 --> 01:49:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:33.709 --> 01:49:33.719 align:start position:0%
think of your testimony and the
 
01:49:49.510 --> 01:49:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:52.370 --> 01:49:52.380 align:start position:0%
you have to pardon me on this one
 
01:49:52.380 --> 01:49:54.070 align:start position:0%
you have to pardon me on this one
um David

01:49:54.070 --> 01:49:54.080 align:start position:0%
um David
 
01:49:57.290 --> 01:49:57.300 align:start position:0%
anybody named David
 
01:49:59.689 --> 01:49:59.699 align:start position:0%
Annie Davids
 
01:50:03.350 --> 01:50:03.360 align:start position:0%
is this possibly your your card
 
01:50:06.350 --> 01:50:06.360 align:start position:0%
Henry are you a doctor sir oh that could
 
01:50:09.590 --> 01:50:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:14.510 --> 01:50:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:16.310 --> 01:50:16.320 align:start position:0%
I had difficulty writing reports As A
 
01:50:17.810 --> 01:50:17.820 align:start position:0%
Firefighter too so
 
01:50:20.990 --> 01:50:21.000 align:start position:0%
my name is David Poole and I represent
 
01:50:22.250 --> 01:50:22.260 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire guides Association
 
01:50:24.770 --> 01:50:24.780 align:start position:0%
today we are here in opposition to this
 
01:50:27.109 --> 01:50:27.119 align:start position:0%
bill and I and I think a couple of the
 
01:50:27.119 --> 01:50:28.129 align:start position:0%
bill and I and I think a couple of the
uh

01:50:28.129 --> 01:50:28.139 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:50:29.450 --> 01:50:29.460 align:start position:0%
points that I was going to make have
 
01:50:32.570 --> 01:50:32.580 align:start position:0%
been well spoken to by some of the folks

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:36.770 align:start position:0%
in front of me what I will say is that I
um

01:50:36.770 --> 01:50:36.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:38.810 --> 01:50:38.820 align:start position:0%
the sponsor identified that there could
 
01:50:41.990 --> 01:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
be some delay uh if you were in a remote
 
01:50:44.270 --> 01:50:44.280 align:start position:0%
area I operated as a fishing guide in
 
01:50:44.280 --> 01:50:45.229 align:start position:0%

Pittsburgh

01:50:45.229 --> 01:50:45.239 align:start position:0%
Pittsburgh
 
01:50:47.510 --> 01:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
operating primarily on three and a half
 
01:50:50.629 --> 01:50:50.639 align:start position:0%
miles of river and there is a single
 
01:50:53.169 --> 01:50:53.179 align:start position:0%
sometimes there's a single Co
 
01:50:55.790 --> 01:50:55.800 align:start position:0%
conservation officer that covers all of
 
01:50:57.470 --> 01:50:57.480 align:start position:0%
Pittsburgh and depending on the day
 
01:50:59.270 --> 01:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
could be covering a lot more
 
01:51:01.850 --> 01:51:01.860 align:start position:0%
so if an individual decided in that
 
01:51:05.209 --> 01:51:05.219 align:start position:0%
three and a half miles there could be
 
01:51:09.470 --> 01:51:09.480 align:start position:0%
50 or 60 or 70 conservatively Anglers
 
01:51:11.689 --> 01:51:11.699 align:start position:0%
one person decides that they're going to
 
01:51:13.850 --> 01:51:13.860 align:start position:0%
exercise their right because they need
 
01:51:15.890 --> 01:51:15.900 align:start position:0%
to they've created they are in violation
 
01:51:17.090 --> 01:51:17.100 align:start position:0%
or because
 
01:51:19.370 --> 01:51:19.380 align:start position:0%
it's principle that they're going to ask
 
01:51:21.950 --> 01:51:21.960 align:start position:0%
for a warrant should this bill be passed
 
01:51:24.229 --> 01:51:24.239 align:start position:0%
that conservation officer for all
 
01:51:26.750 --> 01:51:26.760 align:start position:0%
practical purposes is out of business
 
01:51:30.109 --> 01:51:30.119 align:start position:0%
will never see any of the other 59 or
 
01:51:32.390 --> 01:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
69 people that are on that piece of
 
01:51:33.709 --> 01:51:33.719 align:start position:0%
water just that one little piece of
 
01:51:33.719 --> 01:51:35.149 align:start position:0%
water just that one little piece of
water

01:51:35.149 --> 01:51:35.159 align:start position:0%
water
 
01:51:37.729 --> 01:51:37.739 align:start position:0%
for the rest of the day it's at least
 
01:51:41.209 --> 01:51:41.219 align:start position:0%
half an hour to go to Colebrook
 
01:51:42.770 --> 01:51:42.780 align:start position:0%
get a warrant
 
01:51:44.149 --> 01:51:44.159 align:start position:0%
get back
 
01:51:46.129 --> 01:51:46.139 align:start position:0%
oh and by the way they'd have to secure
 
01:51:47.810 --> 01:51:47.820 align:start position:0%
the the
 
01:51:50.510 --> 01:51:50.520 align:start position:0%
person that and secure the evidence so
 
01:51:52.550 --> 01:51:52.560 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how that would work there's
 
01:51:54.830 --> 01:51:54.840 align:start position:0%
a lot going on and in all that time
 
01:51:57.350 --> 01:51:57.360 align:start position:0%
there's no education of Anglers that has
 
01:51:59.750 --> 01:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
gone on one person spoke to the fact
 
01:52:01.729 --> 01:52:01.739 align:start position:0%
that just a mere presence of a green
 
01:52:01.739 --> 01:52:03.350 align:start position:0%

uh

01:52:05.090 --> 01:52:05.100 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:52:07.609 --> 01:52:07.619 align:start position:0%
how can we put that encourages good
 
01:52:07.619 --> 01:52:08.950 align:start position:0%
how can we put that encourages good
behavior

01:52:08.950 --> 01:52:08.960 align:start position:0%
behavior
 
01:52:11.810 --> 01:52:11.820 align:start position:0%
and that's not happened they only got to
 
01:52:13.490 --> 01:52:13.500 align:start position:0%
that one person and
 
01:52:16.189 --> 01:52:16.199 align:start position:0%
their day is primarily over
 
01:52:17.510 --> 01:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
um as a guide
 
01:52:19.970 --> 01:52:19.980 align:start position:0%
a lot of damage could be done in a very

short period of time without enforcement
 
01:52:24.169 --> 01:52:24.179 align:start position:0%
for fish and game I witness it day in
 
01:52:27.109 --> 01:52:27.119 align:start position:0%
and day out so I would I would we
 
01:52:30.229 --> 01:52:30.239 align:start position:0%
would encourage you to find this pill uh
 
01:52:30.239 --> 01:52:31.250 align:start position:0%
would encourage you to find this pill uh

now down at our fish Co-op
 
01:55:06.310 --> 01:55:06.320 align:start position:0%
we can have up to 20 boats a day Landing
 
01:55:09.890 --> 01:55:09.900 align:start position:0%
and it shouldn't be a requirement for a
 
01:55:12.050 --> 01:55:12.060 align:start position:0%
fish and game officer to come down on
 
01:55:15.350 --> 01:55:15.360 align:start position:0%
the dock and get without a warrant to
 
01:55:17.870 --> 01:55:17.880 align:start position:0%
board a vessel to sample their catch and
 
01:55:19.550 --> 01:55:19.560 align:start position:0%
the same should apply to the premises
 
01:55:21.530 --> 01:55:21.540 align:start position:0%
where all these lobsters are landed we
 
01:55:23.270 --> 01:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
have about four to five thousand pounds
 
01:55:25.669 --> 01:55:25.679 align:start position:0%
of lobsters a day landed in our tanks
 
01:55:28.430 --> 01:55:28.440 align:start position:0%
and we sometimes have up to three to
 
01:55:30.530 --> 01:55:30.540 align:start position:0%
four thousand pounds of ground fish a
 
01:55:34.010 --> 01:55:34.020 align:start position:0%
day landed at our Co-op and
 
01:55:37.189 --> 01:55:37.199 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't have to be have I think
 
01:55:39.410 --> 01:55:39.420 align:start position:0%
Fish and Game offices tied to be able to
 
01:55:41.450 --> 01:55:41.460 align:start position:0%
come into our premises aboard our
 
01:55:45.649 --> 01:55:45.659 align:start position:0%
vessels to sample what catch we have and
 
01:55:49.129 --> 01:55:49.139 align:start position:0%
I just hope that we can
 
01:55:51.830 --> 01:55:51.840 align:start position:0%
and continue to have this kind of
 
01:55:54.830 --> 01:55:54.840 align:start position:0%

01:55:56.629 --> 01:55:56.639 align:start position:0%
that's all I have to say thank you and

uh give testimony to this

um when I first saw Eric's post on this
bill

01:56:42.229 --> 01:56:42.239 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:56:45.350 --> 01:56:45.360 align:start position:0%
I was kind of shocked that we would want
 
01:56:48.169 --> 01:56:48.179 align:start position:0%
to jeopardize our working relationship
 
01:56:51.290 --> 01:56:51.300 align:start position:0%
with fish and game and
 
01:56:55.310 --> 01:56:55.320 align:start position:0%
that's how I see it these guys uh like
 
01:56:57.229 --> 01:56:57.239 align:start position:0%
assault of the earth to work with on the
 
01:56:59.990 --> 01:57:00.000 align:start position:0%

01:57:02.689 --> 01:57:02.699 align:start position:0%
circumstances ever where I felt like my
 
01:57:05.450 --> 01:57:05.460 align:start position:0%

01:57:06.890 --> 01:57:06.900 align:start position:0%
just doesn't happen
 
01:57:10.129 --> 01:57:10.139 align:start position:0%
on a normal day say they come out they

01:57:31.430 --> 01:57:31.440 align:start position:0%
lobsters and off they go that's pretty
 
01:57:33.470 --> 01:57:33.480 align:start position:0%
much a routine stop for fish and game
 
01:57:36.229 --> 01:57:36.239 align:start position:0%
there's no they're not down and below in
 
01:57:38.089 --> 01:57:38.099 align:start position:0%
my builds digging for stuff that's not
 
01:57:40.070 --> 01:57:40.080 align:start position:0%
how it works
 
01:57:42.229 --> 01:57:42.239 align:start position:0%
um Mike said it best most of us are
 
01:57:43.310 --> 01:57:43.320 align:start position:0%
friends with them
 
01:57:44.990 --> 01:57:45.000 align:start position:0%
you know like we we have a great work
 
01:57:46.850 --> 01:57:46.860 align:start position:0%
and relationship and this is
 
01:57:50.089 --> 01:57:50.099 align:start position:0%
going to create a quagmire of
 
01:57:53.870 --> 01:57:53.880 align:start position:0%
call it red tape whatever you will
 
01:57:57.169 --> 01:57:57.179 align:start position:0%
um and I say that because it's
 
01:57:57.179 --> 01:57:57.830 align:start position:0%
um and I say that because it's
um

01:57:57.830 --> 01:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:00.290 --> 01:58:00.300 align:start position:0%
she had brought up earlier what it would
 
01:58:00.300 --> 01:58:01.490 align:start position:0%
she had brought up earlier what it would
cost

01:58:01.490 --> 01:58:01.500 align:start position:0%
cost
 
01:58:04.729 --> 01:58:04.739 align:start position:0%
well I had spoken to enforcement an
 
01:58:06.229 --> 01:58:06.239 align:start position:0%
actual Warden that works on the water
 
01:58:07.729 --> 01:58:07.739 align:start position:0%
this morning
 
01:58:09.830 --> 01:58:09.840 align:start position:0%
and he explained to me how it would work
 
01:58:13.189 --> 01:58:13.199 align:start position:0%
they would stop check us he'd have to
 
01:58:16.310 --> 01:58:16.320 align:start position:0%
wait get a warrant and this warrant
 
01:58:19.010 --> 01:58:19.020 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be an emergency
 
01:58:23.930 --> 01:58:23.940 align:start position:0%
so it would be at the Leisure of a judge
 
01:58:26.990 --> 01:58:27.000 align:start position:0%
to make sure he checked his emails
 
01:58:29.930 --> 01:58:29.940 align:start position:0%
so that he could issue the warrant it
 
01:58:31.970 --> 01:58:31.980 align:start position:0%
could take days it could take seven
 
01:58:34.189 --> 01:58:34.199 align:start position:0%
hours maybe four hours I don't know but
 
01:58:36.950 --> 01:58:36.960 align:start position:0%
it's going to cost me money
 
01:58:39.109 --> 01:58:39.119 align:start position:0%
um we talk about the resource in
 
01:58:41.109 --> 01:58:41.119 align:start position:0%
protecting the resource
 
01:58:44.629 --> 01:58:44.639 align:start position:0%
the resource this is a well-managed
 
01:58:46.250 --> 01:58:46.260 align:start position:0%
fishery it's the most sustainable
 
01:58:48.530 --> 01:58:48.540 align:start position:0%
fishery on the East Coast out there to
 
01:58:51.050 --> 01:58:51.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:53.689 --> 01:58:53.699 align:start position:0%
um I have a son and a daughter they're
 
01:58:56.510 --> 01:58:56.520 align:start position:0%
also involved in Fisheries you know I'm
 
01:58:58.430 --> 01:58:58.440 align:start position:0%
not going to be fishing for the next 40
 
01:59:01.189 --> 01:59:01.199 align:start position:0%
years but my there's a potential that my
 
01:59:03.890 --> 01:59:03.900 align:start position:0%
my son and my daughter are and I think
 
01:59:06.770 --> 01:59:06.780 align:start position:0%
it's Paramount that we do not handcuffed
 
01:59:11.450 --> 01:59:11.460 align:start position:0%
our relationship with fish and game for
 
01:59:15.649 --> 01:59:15.659 align:start position:0%
what could be perceived as violating My
 
01:59:18.530 --> 01:59:18.540 align:start position:0%
Liberty I more look at it like
 
01:59:18.540 --> 01:59:19.850 align:start position:0%
Liberty I more look at it like
it's

01:59:19.850 --> 01:59:19.860 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:59:22.010 --> 01:59:22.020 align:start position:0%
I kinda
 
01:59:24.589 --> 01:59:24.599 align:start position:0%
um when I signed my Lobster permit and
 
01:59:27.050 --> 01:59:27.060 align:start position:0%
buy it there's a certain due diligence
 
01:59:29.870 --> 01:59:29.880 align:start position:0%
in in a line for me
 
01:59:32.450 --> 01:59:32.460 align:start position:0%
that I'm going to be work with these
 
01:59:34.430 --> 01:59:34.440 align:start position:0%
people and not against them
 
01:59:37.129 --> 01:59:37.139 align:start position:0%
so that's I guess pretty much what I
 
01:59:39.189 --> 01:59:39.199 align:start position:0%
have thanks
 
01:59:42.229 --> 01:59:42.239 align:start position:0%
any questions no thank you for your
 
01:59:42.239 --> 01:59:44.930 align:start position:0%
any questions no thank you for your
testimony

01:59:44.930 --> 01:59:44.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:47.810 --> 01:59:47.820 align:start position:0%
that's the last one yeah okay
 
01:59:47.820 --> 01:59:52.030 align:start position:0%
that's the last one yeah okay
Jordan

01:59:52.030 --> 01:59:52.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:54.649 --> 01:59:54.659 align:start position:0%
chair uh calls
 
02:00:02.470 --> 02:00:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:06.890 --> 02:00:06.900 align:start position:0%
good morning I I too have some uh
 
02:00:08.570 --> 02:00:08.580 align:start position:0%
paperwork I'd like to distribute for the
 
02:00:08.580 --> 02:00:16.129 align:start position:0%
paperwork I'd like to distribute for the
committee

02:00:16.129 --> 02:00:16.139 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:19.129 --> 02:00:19.139 align:start position:0%
so this bill has been before the house I
 
02:00:21.470 --> 02:00:21.480 align:start position:0%
think we're up to seven times now if you
 
02:00:23.149 --> 02:00:23.159 align:start position:0%
haven't ever heard me testify you will
 
02:00:24.470 --> 02:00:24.480 align:start position:0%
never forget it because I'm very
 
02:00:26.030 --> 02:00:26.040 align:start position:0%
passionate about it and I'm very
 
02:00:28.250 --> 02:00:28.260 align:start position:0%
passionate about it because I agree with
 
02:00:30.589 --> 02:00:30.599 align:start position:0%
almost every person who's been up here
 
02:00:32.149 --> 02:00:32.159 align:start position:0%
and if you watch closely you'll see
 
02:00:33.649 --> 02:00:33.659 align:start position:0%
representative Hull fall out of his
 
02:00:36.649 --> 02:00:36.659 align:start position:0%
chair but I agree with him as well I
 
02:00:38.209 --> 02:00:38.219 align:start position:0%
don't think there's anything on God's
 
02:00:41.270 --> 02:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
Earth more precious to me than my rights
 
02:00:43.490 --> 02:00:43.500 align:start position:0%
my civil rights and I lead my agency
 
02:00:45.950 --> 02:00:45.960 align:start position:0%
with that in mind and I don't read about
 
02:00:47.990 --> 02:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
it ladies and gentlemen I make my living
 
02:00:50.570 --> 02:00:50.580 align:start position:0%
on it every day that's what I'm paid to
 
02:00:52.970 --> 02:00:52.980 align:start position:0%
do is to to pay attention to people's
 
02:00:54.589 --> 02:00:54.599 align:start position:0%
rights and I know chairman Roy did it
 
02:00:56.270 --> 02:00:56.280 align:start position:0%
for years as a police officer he knows
 
02:00:58.970 --> 02:00:58.980 align:start position:0%
exactly what I'm saying it is not
 
02:01:01.370 --> 02:01:01.380 align:start position:0%
something to be taken lightly under any
 
02:01:04.129 --> 02:01:04.139 align:start position:0%
circumstances or any conditions I do
 
02:01:06.350 --> 02:01:06.360 align:start position:0%
disagree with with representative hole
 
02:01:07.609 --> 02:01:07.619 align:start position:0%
and I'll give you a little bit of
 
02:01:09.530 --> 02:01:09.540 align:start position:0%
History because I was I was the reason
 
02:01:12.530 --> 02:01:12.540 align:start position:0%
this changed we never fishing game
 
02:01:15.890 --> 02:01:15.900 align:start position:0%
officers for uh since the 30s have never
 
02:01:18.229 --> 02:01:18.239 align:start position:0%
had add the ability or the powers or the
 
02:01:19.970 --> 02:01:19.980 align:start position:0%
authority to stop a motor vehicle on the
 
02:01:22.189 --> 02:01:22.199 align:start position:0%
highway now most of us never worried too
 
02:01:24.830 --> 02:01:24.840 align:start position:0%
much about that until you came across
 
02:01:26.870 --> 02:01:26.880 align:start position:0%
working a Night Hunter for instance you
 
02:01:28.870 --> 02:01:28.880 align:start position:0%
were out at night working in a field
 
02:01:31.609 --> 02:01:31.619 align:start position:0%
which encompasses a lot of time at night
 
02:01:33.050 --> 02:01:33.060 align:start position:0%
you're coming home at two o'clock in the
 
02:01:34.430 --> 02:01:34.440 align:start position:0%
morning and you come up behind a motor
 
02:01:36.970 --> 02:01:36.980 align:start position:0%
vehicle that's all over the road
 
02:01:40.010 --> 02:01:40.020 align:start position:0%
based on the same we all get and this is
 
02:01:41.990 --> 02:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
important to remember all police in the
 
02:01:43.310 --> 02:01:43.320 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and I think we're
 
02:01:45.649 --> 02:01:45.659 align:start position:0%
very lucky here all state all police in
 
02:01:46.609 --> 02:01:46.619 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire get equal
 
02:01:48.530 --> 02:01:48.540 align:start position:0%
training I'm in the academy with
 
02:01:51.290 --> 02:01:51.300 align:start position:0%
Troopers with sheriffs with local police
 
02:01:53.030 --> 02:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
officers and I think that's the key to
 
02:01:54.649 --> 02:01:54.659 align:start position:0%
the success that New Hampshire law
 
02:01:56.810 --> 02:01:56.820 align:start position:0%
enforcement has had is that we all
 
02:01:58.550 --> 02:01:58.560 align:start position:0%
receive the same training at the same
 
02:02:00.830 --> 02:02:00.840 align:start position:0%
level that's very important to remember
 
02:02:02.810 --> 02:02:02.820 align:start position:0%
so I know based on my training
 
02:02:03.890 --> 02:02:03.900 align:start position:0%
experience that I'm following an
 
02:02:04.970 --> 02:02:04.980 align:start position:0%
impaired driver
 
02:02:06.950 --> 02:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
and so naturally I'm a police officer
 
02:02:08.930 --> 02:02:08.940 align:start position:0%
with with emergency blue lights it's my
 
02:02:10.850 --> 02:02:10.860 align:start position:0%
responsibility and duty to stop this
 
02:02:12.470 --> 02:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
person before they run someone over on
 
02:02:15.229 --> 02:02:15.239 align:start position:0%
the highway a relative of one of you
 
02:02:17.870 --> 02:02:17.880 align:start position:0%
the problem with that is in those days
 
02:02:20.390 --> 02:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
if you pulled over a drunk driver
 
02:02:23.390 --> 02:02:23.400 align:start position:0%
you essentially have signed his ability
 
02:02:25.189 --> 02:02:25.199 align:start position:0%
to get away with that charge because you
 
02:02:27.589 --> 02:02:27.599 align:start position:0%
don't have the authority to do that so
 
02:02:29.689 --> 02:02:29.699 align:start position:0%
I've got officers driving behind a drunk
 
02:02:29.699 --> 02:02:30.770 align:start position:0%
I've got officers driving behind a drunk
driver

02:02:30.770 --> 02:02:30.780 align:start position:0%
driver
 
02:02:33.229 --> 02:02:33.239 align:start position:0%
they are weighing in their mind should I
 
02:02:34.729 --> 02:02:34.739 align:start position:0%
get this guy off the road because they
 
02:02:36.950 --> 02:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
know that they should by law because
 
02:02:39.290 --> 02:02:39.300 align:start position:0%
it's the right thing to do but they also
 
02:02:40.790 --> 02:02:40.800 align:start position:0%
know if in fact they do that they're
 
02:02:42.530 --> 02:02:42.540 align:start position:0%
going to lose that case in a courtroom
 
02:02:45.169 --> 02:02:45.179 align:start position:0%
and it was done all the time the defense
 
02:02:46.430 --> 02:02:46.440 align:start position:0%
attorney would get up and his first
 
02:02:48.290 --> 02:02:48.300 align:start position:0%
argument would be who stopped did you
 
02:02:50.510 --> 02:02:50.520 align:start position:0%
stop representative approved from
 
02:02:52.129 --> 02:02:52.139 align:start position:0%
driving down the highway drunk yes sir I
 
02:02:53.570 --> 02:02:53.580 align:start position:0%
did did you and what Authority did you
 
02:02:55.669 --> 02:02:55.679 align:start position:0%
do that with well I didn't have the
 
02:02:57.410 --> 02:02:57.420 align:start position:0%
authority and so that case would go out
 
02:02:58.370 --> 02:02:58.380 align:start position:0%
the window
 
02:03:00.589 --> 02:03:00.599 align:start position:0%
that's just one example there would be
 
02:03:01.790 --> 02:03:01.800 align:start position:0%
speeding there would be Reckless
 
02:03:03.410 --> 02:03:03.420 align:start position:0%
operation it would be all of those
 
02:03:04.790 --> 02:03:04.800 align:start position:0%
things that involved the motor vehicle
 
02:03:06.410 --> 02:03:06.420 align:start position:0%
stuff but we didn't have the powers
 
02:03:08.330 --> 02:03:08.340 align:start position:0%
so I went to the Municipal Police
 
02:03:10.370 --> 02:03:10.380 align:start position:0%
Association I talked to the New
 
02:03:12.470 --> 02:03:12.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State Troopers Association and
 
02:03:15.830 --> 02:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
we worked together back in 2014 to get
 
02:03:19.010 --> 02:03:19.020 align:start position:0%
that Authority for that simple reason
 
02:03:20.689 --> 02:03:20.699 align:start position:0%
I don't have game wardens and you're not
 
02:03:22.010 --> 02:03:22.020 align:start position:0%
going to see you better not see game
 
02:03:24.709 --> 02:03:24.719 align:start position:0%
wardens out on Interstate 93 in their
 
02:03:26.330 --> 02:03:26.340 align:start position:0%
cruiser with a radar gun they've got way
 
02:03:28.790 --> 02:03:28.800 align:start position:0%
too much to do that was not why we did
 
02:03:30.950 --> 02:03:30.960 align:start position:0%
that we did it for emergency type
 
02:03:34.010 --> 02:03:34.020 align:start position:0%
situations and only that when you saw
 
02:03:36.830 --> 02:03:36.840 align:start position:0%
someone who was endangering the public
 
02:03:39.050 --> 02:03:39.060 align:start position:0%
or endangering themselves and if you
 
02:03:40.910 --> 02:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
didn't take immediate action that danger
 
02:03:45.410 --> 02:03:45.420 align:start position:0%
could could multiply so in 2014 we asked
 
02:03:47.689 --> 02:03:47.699 align:start position:0%
and came here to this body in the Senate
 
02:03:49.430 --> 02:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
and asked for that Authority and
 
02:03:51.229 --> 02:03:51.239 align:start position:0%
explained all of this and and that was
 
02:03:53.149 --> 02:03:53.159 align:start position:0%
put into the law and representative Hull
 
02:03:54.470 --> 02:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
quoted it
 
02:03:56.270 --> 02:03:56.280 align:start position:0%
almost correctly
 
02:03:57.830 --> 02:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
I'll read it to you and it's very
 
02:03:59.030 --> 02:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
important the other thing I want to
 
02:04:01.189 --> 02:04:01.199 align:start position:0%
explain to you in a courtroom if you
 
02:04:02.330 --> 02:04:02.340 align:start position:0%
haven't ever been in a courtroom
 
02:04:04.370 --> 02:04:04.380 align:start position:0%
prosecuted a case when you prosecute a
 
02:04:06.290 --> 02:04:06.300 align:start position:0%
case based on the laws that you folks
 
02:04:07.910 --> 02:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
write for us
 
02:04:10.850 --> 02:04:10.860 align:start position:0%
you can win or lose a case based on one
 
02:04:13.729 --> 02:04:13.739 align:start position:0%
word in a statute if a word says or
 
02:04:16.550 --> 02:04:16.560 align:start position:0%
instead of and and you took a step that
 
02:04:18.169 --> 02:04:18.179 align:start position:0%
didn't include that you're going to lose
 
02:04:19.850 --> 02:04:19.860 align:start position:0%
your case I struggle with that with
 
02:04:20.990 --> 02:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
young officers they don't understand
 
02:04:22.609 --> 02:04:22.619 align:start position:0%
that they think it should be common
 
02:04:24.950 --> 02:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
sense Common Sense doesn't exist in a
 
02:04:27.950 --> 02:04:27.960 align:start position:0%
courtroom for many reasons they read a
 
02:04:30.109 --> 02:04:30.119 align:start position:0%
statute literally the way it's written
 
02:04:31.910 --> 02:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
that's why we're over here hammering all
 
02:04:33.169 --> 02:04:33.179 align:start position:0%
the time to make sure that they're
 
02:04:35.089 --> 02:04:35.099 align:start position:0%
written so that we can enforce it and
 
02:04:36.530 --> 02:04:36.540 align:start position:0%
this is a good example of why that's
 
02:04:36.540 --> 02:04:37.550 align:start position:0%
this is a good example of why that's
important

02:04:37.550 --> 02:04:37.560 align:start position:0%
important
 
02:04:39.470 --> 02:04:39.480 align:start position:0%
so I'll read it to you two and four this
 
02:04:41.990 --> 02:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
was the new paragraph added in 2014 to
 
02:04:44.270 --> 02:04:44.280 align:start position:0%
enforce all provisions of RSA title 21
 
02:04:46.729 --> 02:04:46.739 align:start position:0%
which is relative to Motor Vehicle Laws
 
02:04:46.739 --> 02:04:48.169 align:start position:0%
which is relative to Motor Vehicle Laws
absent

02:04:48.169 --> 02:04:48.179 align:start position:0%
absent
 
02:04:50.689 --> 02:04:50.699 align:start position:0%
any efficient any violation of suspected
 
02:04:53.450 --> 02:04:53.460 align:start position:0%
violation of fish and game laws and this
 
02:04:55.609 --> 02:04:55.619 align:start position:0%
is what's key ladies and gentlemen with
 
02:04:59.089 --> 02:04:59.099 align:start position:0%
the same Authority and Powers as any
 
02:05:01.250 --> 02:05:01.260 align:start position:0%
other certified law enforcement in the
 
02:05:01.260 --> 02:05:02.810 align:start position:0%
other certified law enforcement in the
state

02:05:02.810 --> 02:05:02.820 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:05:05.750 --> 02:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
the same Authority and Powers is any
 
02:05:07.490 --> 02:05:07.500 align:start position:0%
other certified law enforcement officer
 
02:05:09.169 --> 02:05:09.179 align:start position:0%
in the state that does not give me the
 
02:05:11.510 --> 02:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
authority to pop a trunk on a car on 93
 
02:05:13.490 --> 02:05:13.500 align:start position:0%
unless New Hampshire State Police can do
 
02:05:15.770 --> 02:05:15.780 align:start position:0%
it it's the same authorities and Powers
 
02:05:18.470 --> 02:05:18.480 align:start position:0%
you can't you can't do that kind of
 
02:05:21.229 --> 02:05:21.239 align:start position:0%
stuff in America today thankfully you'd
 
02:05:22.609 --> 02:05:22.619 align:start position:0%
be on the front page of every state
 
02:05:22.619 --> 02:05:24.410 align:start position:0%
be on the front page of every state
paper

02:05:24.410 --> 02:05:24.420 align:start position:0%
paper
 
02:05:27.709 --> 02:05:27.719 align:start position:0%
so that problem that he brought up does
 
02:05:29.990 --> 02:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
not exist because the it's very clear in
 
02:05:31.790 --> 02:05:31.800 align:start position:0%
the law and we wrote it that way so that
 
02:05:33.050 --> 02:05:33.060 align:start position:0%
it would be very clear in the law
 
02:05:35.930 --> 02:05:35.940 align:start position:0%
because it was a debate back then about
 
02:05:38.330 --> 02:05:38.340 align:start position:0%
us having more Powers than anyone else
 
02:05:41.209 --> 02:05:41.219 align:start position:0%
and I hear that all the time it's a hoax
 
02:05:43.669 --> 02:05:43.679 align:start position:0%
we're all bound by the same Constitution
 
02:05:45.470 --> 02:05:45.480 align:start position:0%
we're all bound by the same Federal
 
02:05:47.990 --> 02:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
Constitution thankfully we all have to
 
02:05:50.330 --> 02:05:50.340 align:start position:0%
operate the same what differs with us
 
02:05:52.370 --> 02:05:52.380 align:start position:0%
and what people struggle to understand
 
02:05:55.490 --> 02:05:55.500 align:start position:0%
and we and as I said we've been here six
 
02:06:00.770 --> 02:06:00.780 align:start position:0%
times with this HB 282 HB 1091 HB 1677
 
02:06:06.470 --> 02:06:06.480 align:start position:0%
HB 1566 and today HB 4498 it's because
 
02:06:09.050 --> 02:06:09.060 align:start position:0%
people don't understand it the good news
 
02:06:11.570 --> 02:06:11.580 align:start position:0%
is the guys in force in this do
 
02:06:13.490 --> 02:06:13.500 align:start position:0%
understand it and I tell you that
 
02:06:15.530 --> 02:06:15.540 align:start position:0%
because I'd ask you today to reach back
 
02:06:17.750 --> 02:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
in your recent memory and tell me when
 
02:06:19.790 --> 02:06:19.800 align:start position:0%
the last time you saw a New Hampshire
 
02:06:22.729 --> 02:06:22.739 align:start position:0%
Fish and Game officer on the news or in
 
02:06:24.770 --> 02:06:24.780 align:start position:0%
any local papers violating someone's
 
02:06:27.410 --> 02:06:27.420 align:start position:0%
rights or listen to the people that have
 
02:06:29.510 --> 02:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
been up here behind me that we board
 
02:06:32.450 --> 02:06:32.460 align:start position:0%
their boats on a regular basis that we
 
02:06:34.010 --> 02:06:34.020 align:start position:0%
stop in the field when they're hunting
 
02:06:35.390 --> 02:06:35.400 align:start position:0%
and fishing they're here telling you
 
02:06:37.250 --> 02:06:37.260 align:start position:0%
they want that to continue those are the
 
02:06:39.229 --> 02:06:39.239 align:start position:0%
very people that are subject to those
 
02:06:41.629 --> 02:06:41.639 align:start position:0%
searches now I don't want to ignore what
 
02:06:44.270 --> 02:06:44.280 align:start position:0%
the young man said from Bristol Bristol
 
02:06:46.850 --> 02:06:46.860 align:start position:0%
or Bridgewater I'm with him on principle
 
02:06:48.950 --> 02:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
I'm with him that those rights are very
 
02:06:51.770 --> 02:06:51.780 align:start position:0%
important we don't have that Authority
 
02:06:53.810 --> 02:06:53.820 align:start position:0%
you know when I get a young guy on and
 
02:06:55.250 --> 02:06:55.260 align:start position:0%
we get him in a room those first two
 
02:06:56.930 --> 02:06:56.940 align:start position:0%
weeks and we start telling them you know
 
02:06:58.490 --> 02:06:58.500 align:start position:0%
we start talking about powers and
 
02:07:00.109 --> 02:07:00.119 align:start position:0%
authorities and they get real excited
 
02:07:02.209 --> 02:07:02.219 align:start position:0%
because they think they can just go and
 
02:07:04.189 --> 02:07:04.199 align:start position:0%
and rip your backpack off and start
 
02:07:06.290 --> 02:07:06.300 align:start position:0%
searching it they can do that once
 
02:07:08.330 --> 02:07:08.340 align:start position:0%
they're going to get away with it once
 
02:07:09.709 --> 02:07:09.719 align:start position:0%
and then they're going to get their case
 
02:07:10.910 --> 02:07:10.920 align:start position:0%
handed to them and they're probably
 
02:07:12.589 --> 02:07:12.599 align:start position:0%
going to be looking for work because you
 
02:07:16.310 --> 02:07:16.320 align:start position:0%
can't do that thankfully we have the
 
02:07:18.350 --> 02:07:18.360 align:start position:0%
same Authority what what I always try to
 
02:07:20.330 --> 02:07:20.340 align:start position:0%
liken it to is think about what a police
 
02:07:21.770 --> 02:07:21.780 align:start position:0%
officer does because everybody knows
 
02:07:23.870 --> 02:07:23.880 align:start position:0%
that I was a police officer for years
 
02:07:26.209 --> 02:07:26.219 align:start position:0%
unlike popular belief you do not need
 
02:07:27.950 --> 02:07:27.960 align:start position:0%
probable cause to stop a car on a
 
02:07:29.089 --> 02:07:29.099 align:start position:0%
highway television will tell you that
 
02:07:30.350 --> 02:07:30.360 align:start position:0%
what was your probable cause for the
 
02:07:32.030 --> 02:07:32.040 align:start position:0%
start that's a hoax you don't need it
 
02:07:34.490 --> 02:07:34.500 align:start position:0%
you need articulable suspicion to stop
 
02:07:36.050 --> 02:07:36.060 align:start position:0%
that person there's a big difference
 
02:07:38.209 --> 02:07:38.219 align:start position:0%
between those two articable suspicion is
 
02:07:41.689 --> 02:07:41.699 align:start position:0%
I think based on a certain set of facts
 
02:07:43.669 --> 02:07:43.679 align:start position:0%
that this individual is doing something
 
02:07:45.530 --> 02:07:45.540 align:start position:0%
wrong that's our tickable suspicion
 
02:07:47.750 --> 02:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
probable cause is much higher than that
 
02:07:51.109 --> 02:07:51.119 align:start position:0%
probable cause is I can prove that this
 
02:07:53.810 --> 02:07:53.820 align:start position:0%
person is doing something wrong okay
 
02:07:57.109 --> 02:07:57.119 align:start position:0%
so a police officer on the highway is
 
02:07:58.850 --> 02:07:58.860 align:start position:0%
only required to have articulable
 
02:08:00.950 --> 02:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
suspicion then he can pull you over he
 
02:08:03.229 --> 02:08:03.239 align:start position:0%
has to be able to articulate later in a
 
02:08:05.089 --> 02:08:05.099 align:start position:0%
courtroom why he did that he can't make
 
02:08:07.189 --> 02:08:07.199 align:start position:0%
something up it's got to be he's got to
 
02:08:08.870 --> 02:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
be speeding there's got to be a swerve
 
02:08:10.310 --> 02:08:10.320 align:start position:0%
or a light out there's got to be
 
02:08:13.370 --> 02:08:13.380 align:start position:0%
articulable suspicion once he stops you
 
02:08:15.770 --> 02:08:15.780 align:start position:0%
he can ask for your license he can look
 
02:08:17.390 --> 02:08:17.400 align:start position:0%
in the car and see if your child's in a
 
02:08:19.729 --> 02:08:19.739 align:start position:0%
in a car seat he can look in and see if
 
02:08:21.109 --> 02:08:21.119 align:start position:0%
you got your cell phone in your hand and
 
02:08:23.390 --> 02:08:23.400 align:start position:0%
your texting he can if he smells alcohol
 
02:08:25.070 --> 02:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
he can ask you to step from the vehicle
 
02:08:26.689 --> 02:08:26.699 align:start position:0%
and he can perform a field sobriety test
 
02:08:28.310 --> 02:08:28.320 align:start position:0%
those are all searches ladies and
 
02:08:31.129 --> 02:08:31.139 align:start position:0%
gentlemen that's a search
 
02:08:34.189 --> 02:08:34.199 align:start position:0%
those are searches we get to do the same
 
02:08:36.350 --> 02:08:36.360 align:start position:0%
thing we get to do the very same thing
 
02:08:38.570 --> 02:08:38.580 align:start position:0%
we're not in a car but I see you fishing
 
02:08:40.669 --> 02:08:40.679 align:start position:0%
you're casting a line into the water I
 
02:08:41.930 --> 02:08:41.940 align:start position:0%
might see you catch a fish you're
 
02:08:44.149 --> 02:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
reeling it up is that an articulable
 
02:08:45.950 --> 02:08:45.960 align:start position:0%
suspicion or a reason to check your
 
02:08:47.689 --> 02:08:47.699 align:start position:0%
fishing license if you're required to
 
02:08:49.669 --> 02:08:49.679 align:start position:0%
have it by law and you're fishing long
 
02:08:51.290 --> 02:08:51.300 align:start position:0%
as I can demonstrate that you're fishing
 
02:08:53.330 --> 02:08:53.340 align:start position:0%
I can go check your license while I'm
 
02:08:55.189 --> 02:08:55.199 align:start position:0%
there we typically will ask you if you
 
02:08:56.750 --> 02:08:56.760 align:start position:0%
caught any fish how's the fishing today
 
02:08:59.089 --> 02:08:59.099 align:start position:0%
and people will say yeah I've caught two
 
02:09:01.370 --> 02:09:01.380 align:start position:0%
our next standard answer to that our
 
02:09:04.070 --> 02:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
question is can I see him can I see your
 
02:09:07.729 --> 02:09:07.739 align:start position:0%
fish do you know 99.9 of the time people
 
02:09:10.070 --> 02:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
will openly show you their fish but
 
02:09:11.689 --> 02:09:11.699 align:start position:0%
let's say somebody doesn't let's say
 
02:09:13.129 --> 02:09:13.139 align:start position:0%
they don't show you the fish no I don't
 
02:09:14.810 --> 02:09:14.820 align:start position:0%
want to show you the fish I run into
 
02:09:16.370 --> 02:09:16.380 align:start position:0%
representative Hull who knows what his
 
02:09:18.470 --> 02:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
rights are and he says Nope Colonel
 
02:09:21.290 --> 02:09:21.300 align:start position:0%
you're not looking in my backpack
 
02:09:23.930 --> 02:09:23.940 align:start position:0%
my officers don't have the The Authority
 
02:09:25.850 --> 02:09:25.860 align:start position:0%
at that point to rip his backpack off
 
02:09:27.830 --> 02:09:27.840 align:start position:0%
and look in it they're gonna go get a
 
02:09:29.870 --> 02:09:29.880 align:start position:0%
warrant for that okay whether they like
 
02:09:31.310 --> 02:09:31.320 align:start position:0%
it or not that's how that's going to
 
02:09:31.320 --> 02:09:32.209 align:start position:0%
it or not that's how that's going to
work

02:09:32.209 --> 02:09:32.219 align:start position:0%
work
 
02:09:34.250 --> 02:09:34.260 align:start position:0%
and and I'm telling you that happens
 
02:09:36.229 --> 02:09:36.239 align:start position:0%
because if it didn't happen think about
 
02:09:38.810 --> 02:09:38.820 align:start position:0%
where we are in a close watch that's on
 
02:09:40.510 --> 02:09:40.520 align:start position:0%
law enforcement today in this country
 
02:09:43.129 --> 02:09:43.139 align:start position:0%
anyone violating those rights would be
 
02:09:45.169 --> 02:09:45.179 align:start position:0%
discovered the courts would not tolerate
 
02:09:47.870 --> 02:09:47.880 align:start position:0%
that not for a second thankfully this
 
02:09:50.689 --> 02:09:50.699 align:start position:0%
law has been on the book since 1935 it
 
02:09:53.270 --> 02:09:53.280 align:start position:0%
was created so essentially it's been in
 
02:09:57.229 --> 02:09:57.239 align:start position:0%
law for 88 years and in 88 years I
 
02:10:00.050 --> 02:10:00.060 align:start position:0%
couldn't sit here and accurately
 
02:10:01.970 --> 02:10:01.980 align:start position:0%
um guesstimate at how many times that's
 
02:10:04.970 --> 02:10:04.980 align:start position:0%
had judicial review a court trial but I
 
02:10:06.530 --> 02:10:06.540 align:start position:0%
can bet it's in the hundreds of
 
02:10:09.470 --> 02:10:09.480 align:start position:0%
thousands if not more defense attorneys
 
02:10:11.209 --> 02:10:11.219 align:start position:0%
Prosecuting attorneys people a lot
 
02:10:13.669 --> 02:10:13.679 align:start position:0%
smarter than me judges all reviewing
 
02:10:15.109 --> 02:10:15.119 align:start position:0%
this and arguing whether it was
 
02:10:17.450 --> 02:10:17.460 align:start position:0%
legitimate whether it was legal whether
 
02:10:19.490 --> 02:10:19.500 align:start position:0%
it violated someone's rights and yet
 
02:10:21.890 --> 02:10:21.900 align:start position:0%
here we are 88 years later it hasn't
 
02:10:24.290 --> 02:10:24.300 align:start position:0%
changed it hasn't changed it's gone to
 
02:10:26.209 --> 02:10:26.219 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court three times New
 
02:10:27.890 --> 02:10:27.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court on three
 
02:10:30.109 --> 02:10:30.119 align:start position:0%
occasions and I brought those the first
 
02:10:32.870 --> 02:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
one was in 1973
 
02:10:35.030 --> 02:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
no relation to a previous speaker who
 
02:10:36.770 --> 02:10:36.780 align:start position:0%
was here with State V Marconi and this
 
02:10:38.629 --> 02:10:38.639 align:start position:0%
involved a lobster fisherman Who
 
02:10:40.370 --> 02:10:40.380 align:start position:0%
challenged the fact that we boarded a
 
02:10:43.430 --> 02:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
boat and did a regulatory inspection of
 
02:10:45.290 --> 02:10:45.300 align:start position:0%
his catch and our New Hampshire Supreme
 
02:10:47.990 --> 02:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
Court quoted this I'll quote them
 
02:10:50.870 --> 02:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
if I can see it
 
02:10:53.270 --> 02:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
we do not read in our statutes any such
 
02:10:55.430 --> 02:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
all-encompassing restraints on ordinary
 
02:10:57.109 --> 02:10:57.119 align:start position:0%
Patrol and inspection of lobster
 
02:10:59.629 --> 02:10:59.639 align:start position:0%
fishermen nor do we find the Fourth
 
02:11:01.910 --> 02:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
Amendment your right to against illegal
 
02:11:03.350 --> 02:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
searches to the United States
 
02:11:05.089 --> 02:11:05.099 align:start position:0%
Constitution bars a reasonable
 
02:11:06.950 --> 02:11:06.960 align:start position:0%
inspection of lobster boats operated
 
02:11:09.649 --> 02:11:09.659 align:start position:0%
under the license from the state so they
 
02:11:13.189 --> 02:11:13.199 align:start position:0%
viewed the very fact of of why this bill
 
02:11:14.510 --> 02:11:14.520 align:start position:0%
was brought today and said it doesn't
 
02:11:16.729 --> 02:11:16.739 align:start position:0%
violate anyone's rights they didn't stop
 
02:11:18.709 --> 02:11:18.719 align:start position:0%
there that we brought another case in
 
02:11:20.750 --> 02:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
2009 a gentleman by the name of Paul
 
02:11:23.270 --> 02:11:23.280 align:start position:0%
Kimball who refused to let an officer
 
02:11:25.189 --> 02:11:25.199 align:start position:0%
into a bob house on a public body of
 
02:11:27.109 --> 02:11:27.119 align:start position:0%
water our Supreme Court once again
 
02:11:30.290 --> 02:11:30.300 align:start position:0%
reviewed the law the 206-26 in in
 
02:11:32.510 --> 02:11:32.520 align:start position:0%
particular and said further the Court
 
02:11:34.609 --> 02:11:34.619 align:start position:0%
held that Hensel who was the officer at
 
02:11:37.010 --> 02:11:37.020 align:start position:0%
the time had reasonable cause which is
 
02:11:38.990 --> 02:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
the same as or similar articulable
 
02:11:41.209 --> 02:11:41.219 align:start position:0%
suspicion to believe that the defendant
 
02:11:43.910 --> 02:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
had illegal wildlife in the Fish House
 
02:11:46.430 --> 02:11:46.440 align:start position:0%
he was justified under the law to search
 
02:11:47.930 --> 02:11:47.940 align:start position:0%
the fish house and seize all the
 
02:11:49.189 --> 02:11:49.199 align:start position:0%
evidence without the defendant's
 
02:11:50.629 --> 02:11:50.639 align:start position:0%
permission without the need of a search
 
02:11:50.639 --> 02:11:51.589 align:start position:0%
permission without the need of a search
warrant

02:11:51.589 --> 02:11:51.599 align:start position:0%
warrant
 
02:11:54.109 --> 02:11:54.119 align:start position:0%
that was in 2009 and then finally in
 
02:11:56.750 --> 02:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
2011 State beauchement involved a
 
02:11:59.030 --> 02:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
baiting case and a quote from that
 
02:12:00.589 --> 02:12:00.599 align:start position:0%
decision from our New Hampshire Supreme
 
02:12:02.629 --> 02:12:02.639 align:start position:0%
Court permits conservation offices go on
 
02:12:04.310 --> 02:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
any property outside of a building to
 
02:12:05.750 --> 02:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
enforce Wildlife rules and regulations
 
02:12:08.570 --> 02:12:08.580 align:start position:0%
but does not allow them to enter such
 
02:12:10.490 --> 02:12:10.500 align:start position:0%
buildings without a warrant thankfully
 
02:12:12.950 --> 02:12:12.960 align:start position:0%
here the defendant's porch was part of
 
02:12:14.390 --> 02:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
the property outside of the house and
 
02:12:15.830 --> 02:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
building officer Brown was therefore
 
02:12:17.689 --> 02:12:17.699 align:start position:0%
with any statutory powers to go on the
 
02:12:19.189 --> 02:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
defendant's porch and enforce all the
 
02:12:20.870 --> 02:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
laws and regulations what's important
 
02:12:24.050 --> 02:12:24.060 align:start position:0%
about that those are three times that
 
02:12:25.550 --> 02:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
our that this law has gone to our
 
02:12:27.709 --> 02:12:27.719 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court where we rely on them to
 
02:12:29.689 --> 02:12:29.699 align:start position:0%
make these changes and I can assure you
 
02:12:32.089 --> 02:12:32.099 align:start position:0%
if this law was defective it would have
 
02:12:34.070 --> 02:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
been changed I've told my officers on
 
02:12:35.750 --> 02:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
100 different occasions at the end of
 
02:12:37.910 --> 02:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
legislative Seasons don't worry about a
 
02:12:40.010 --> 02:12:40.020 align:start position:0%
bad law don't worry if you got a lot of
 
02:12:41.810 --> 02:12:41.820 align:start position:0%
fellows at the guys and gals that you
 
02:12:43.129 --> 02:12:43.139 align:start position:0%
don't think you can enforce because the
 
02:12:45.709 --> 02:12:45.719 align:start position:0%
best way to change them and chairman Roy
 
02:12:47.270 --> 02:12:47.280 align:start position:0%
will agree with this the best way to
 
02:12:49.010 --> 02:12:49.020 align:start position:0%
change a bad law is go out and enforce
 
02:12:49.020 --> 02:12:49.729 align:start position:0%
change a bad law is go out and enforce
it

02:12:49.729 --> 02:12:49.739 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:12:52.069 --> 02:12:52.079 align:start position:0%
go out and enforce the law they gave you
 
02:12:54.470 --> 02:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
because it's going to change if it's not
 
02:12:56.390 --> 02:12:56.400 align:start position:0%
right and it isn't fitting it's going
 
02:12:58.010 --> 02:12:58.020 align:start position:0%
the courts are going to do that for you
 
02:12:59.750 --> 02:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
in 88 years they haven't done it on this
 
02:13:01.729 --> 02:13:01.739 align:start position:0%
I think that's key and then I'm going to
 
02:13:02.990 --> 02:13:03.000 align:start position:0%
leave you with this final thought I'm
 
02:13:05.030 --> 02:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
always proud when I come over here and
 
02:13:06.770 --> 02:13:06.780 align:start position:0%
hear our constituents come up and talk
 
02:13:09.229 --> 02:13:09.239 align:start position:0%
about my officers and how they're how
 
02:13:11.330 --> 02:13:11.340 align:start position:0%
they're treated by them because I and we
 
02:13:13.490 --> 02:13:13.500 align:start position:0%
insist on that I don't it isn't a heavy
 
02:13:15.290 --> 02:13:15.300 align:start position:0%
lift because they're good people they
 
02:13:17.270 --> 02:13:17.280 align:start position:0%
are the best people they didn't get
 
02:13:19.669 --> 02:13:19.679 align:start position:0%
stipends to stay employed unlike many
 
02:13:22.069 --> 02:13:22.079 align:start position:0%
state employees did my guys did not get
 
02:13:24.530 --> 02:13:24.540 align:start position:0%
that they were very angry about that and
 
02:13:25.609 --> 02:13:25.619 align:start position:0%
I said to them you don't have to get
 
02:13:26.990 --> 02:13:27.000 align:start position:0%
paid to do what you guys are doing
 
02:13:29.209 --> 02:13:29.219 align:start position:0%
you're we don't have a shortage of
 
02:13:30.589 --> 02:13:30.599 align:start position:0%
people over there I'm very proud to say
 
02:13:32.750 --> 02:13:32.760 align:start position:0%
we have a good outfit it's a big family
 
02:13:35.390 --> 02:13:35.400 align:start position:0%
is what it is and it's a small group
 
02:13:37.550 --> 02:13:37.560 align:start position:0%
what I'm driving towards is there's a
 
02:13:39.290 --> 02:13:39.300 align:start position:0%
list that comes out every year we used
 
02:13:40.790 --> 02:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
to call it the Lorry list it's now
 
02:13:43.790 --> 02:13:43.800 align:start position:0%
called the exculpatory evidence schedule
 
02:13:46.490 --> 02:13:46.500 align:start position:0%
and it lists over 200 police officers
 
02:13:48.050 --> 02:13:48.060 align:start position:0%
that have made mistakes in our state
 
02:13:50.870 --> 02:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
working these mistakes range from lying
 
02:13:53.290 --> 02:13:53.300 align:start position:0%
to crowd to crimes to violating
 
02:13:55.669 --> 02:13:55.679 align:start position:0%
violating the rights of our citizens I
 
02:13:57.589 --> 02:13:57.599 align:start position:0%
would encourage you to go look at that
 
02:13:59.629 --> 02:13:59.639 align:start position:0%
list and you find me a New Hampshire
 
02:14:01.189 --> 02:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
conservation officer on that list
 
02:14:02.629 --> 02:14:02.639 align:start position:0%
because I'm here to tell you you won't
 
02:14:04.970 --> 02:14:04.980 align:start position:0%
see it because it doesn't happen they
 
02:14:07.069 --> 02:14:07.079 align:start position:0%
don't abuse these Powers if they did
 
02:14:09.350 --> 02:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
they would be on that list and I'm very
 
02:14:11.390 --> 02:14:11.400 align:start position:0%
proud of the fact that they're not I'm
 
02:14:13.010 --> 02:14:13.020 align:start position:0%
sorry I rambled on but I'm very
 
02:14:14.510 --> 02:14:14.520 align:start position:0%
passionate when someone says that we're
 
02:14:16.069 --> 02:14:16.079 align:start position:0%
violating people's rights because we
 
02:14:18.950 --> 02:14:18.960 align:start position:0%
don't do that I would not allow that
 
02:14:23.689 --> 02:14:23.699 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:24.950 --> 02:14:24.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony this
 
02:14:27.350 --> 02:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
morning Karen oh I'm sorry represent we
 
02:14:29.330 --> 02:14:29.340 align:start position:0%
have one question representative Newman
 
02:14:32.390 --> 02:14:32.400 align:start position:0%
yeah I just have one question and it I'm
 
02:14:33.830 --> 02:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
just trying to figure out how all this
 
02:14:36.350 --> 02:14:36.360 align:start position:0%
works all the way to the end so you
 
02:14:38.270 --> 02:14:38.280 align:start position:0%
can't you talked about
 
02:14:38.280 --> 02:14:38.870 align:start position:0%
can't you talked about
um

02:14:38.870 --> 02:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:38.880 --> 02:14:40.069 align:start position:0%
um
um

02:14:40.069 --> 02:14:40.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:43.550 --> 02:14:43.560 align:start position:0%
the uh the suspicion I've checked those
 
02:14:45.890 --> 02:14:45.900 align:start position:0%
suspicious suspicion
 
02:14:47.990 --> 02:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
and you went through and said some you
 
02:14:49.609 --> 02:14:49.619 align:start position:0%
had circumstantial evidence there are a
 
02:14:50.750 --> 02:14:50.760 align:start position:0%
couple of fish and then you want to look
 
02:14:52.490 --> 02:14:52.500 align:start position:0%
in the backpack yes and the one percent
 
02:14:57.050 --> 02:14:57.060 align:start position:0%
says no yep what happens what
 
02:14:59.030 --> 02:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
potentially could happen or what usually
 
02:15:00.649 --> 02:15:00.659 align:start position:0%
happens however you want to describe it
 
02:15:03.050 --> 02:15:03.060 align:start position:0%
what would happen after that and of
 
02:15:04.729 --> 02:15:04.739 align:start position:0%
course like so it would depend on the
 
02:15:06.890 --> 02:15:06.900 align:start position:0%
situation but if he had articulable
 
02:15:08.810 --> 02:15:08.820 align:start position:0%
suspicion to believe that fish were
 
02:15:11.930 --> 02:15:11.940 align:start position:0%
illegally uh taken and and in that
 
02:15:13.609 --> 02:15:13.619 align:start position:0%
backpack he would have the authority to
 
02:15:16.970 --> 02:15:16.980 align:start position:0%
look in there if he was was if he was
 
02:15:19.970 --> 02:15:19.980 align:start position:0%
guessing at that fact if he was just out
 
02:15:21.830 --> 02:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
and and didn't see him catch fish he
 
02:15:24.050 --> 02:15:24.060 align:start position:0%
came by at the end of that and and just
 
02:15:25.850 --> 02:15:25.860 align:start position:0%
thought well he might have fish in there
 
02:15:27.470 --> 02:15:27.480 align:start position:0%
I should ask him and look in there he
 
02:15:28.970 --> 02:15:28.980 align:start position:0%
would not have the authority to tear his
 
02:15:30.530 --> 02:15:30.540 align:start position:0%
backpack off and go through it he would
 
02:15:33.050 --> 02:15:33.060 align:start position:0%
lose that in a quorum thank you yes sir
 
02:15:34.729 --> 02:15:34.739 align:start position:0%
the other thing that's important to
 
02:15:37.310 --> 02:15:37.320 align:start position:0%
remember is you you know this these
 
02:15:39.649 --> 02:15:39.659 align:start position:0%
powers and Authority do not allow you to
 
02:15:39.659 --> 02:15:41.270 align:start position:0%
powers and Authority do not allow you to
circumvent

02:15:41.270 --> 02:15:41.280 align:start position:0%
circumvent
 
02:15:44.089 --> 02:15:44.099 align:start position:0%
uh or to use these powers and authority
 
02:15:48.229 --> 02:15:48.239 align:start position:0%
to go after a marijuana or or uh or a um
 
02:15:50.810 --> 02:15:50.820 align:start position:0%
uh safe an illegal safe taken under
 
02:15:52.910 --> 02:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
burglar you're only looking for wildlife
 
02:15:55.370 --> 02:15:55.380 align:start position:0%
you can only you're only going to be be
 
02:15:57.950 --> 02:15:57.960 align:start position:0%
able to justify your articulable
 
02:15:59.689 --> 02:15:59.699 align:start position:0%
suspicion relating to Wildlife that's
 
02:16:00.950 --> 02:16:00.960 align:start position:0%
what these powers do if you find
 
02:16:03.290 --> 02:16:03.300 align:start position:0%
something else you need to stop and go
 
02:16:04.790 --> 02:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
get a search warrant we just finished
 
02:16:06.890 --> 02:16:06.900 align:start position:0%
we're working on a very big case that's
 
02:16:08.750 --> 02:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
going to be that's going to hit the news
 
02:16:10.550 --> 02:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
here soon that is going to shock some
 
02:16:13.430 --> 02:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
people in the state where better than 30
 
02:16:15.350 --> 02:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
animals were taken illegally it was a
 
02:16:16.609 --> 02:16:16.619 align:start position:0%
whole ring that involved four different
 
02:16:18.350 --> 02:16:18.360 align:start position:0%
states then the officers are wrapping it
 
02:16:20.870 --> 02:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
up now we have done a total of I think
 
02:16:23.330 --> 02:16:23.340 align:start position:0%
we're up to nine search warrants that we
 
02:16:25.189 --> 02:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
write and I got to tell you that has
 
02:16:28.010 --> 02:16:28.020 align:start position:0%
changed today we when I was in the field
 
02:16:29.689 --> 02:16:29.699 align:start position:0%
I could write a warrant I knew my judges
 
02:16:31.250 --> 02:16:31.260 align:start position:0%
they were friends of mine I go bang on
 
02:16:32.750 --> 02:16:32.760 align:start position:0%
their door on a Sunday night go in and
 
02:16:34.610 --> 02:16:34.620 align:start position:0%
it was relatively quick you don't do
 
02:16:36.830 --> 02:16:36.840 align:start position:0%
that anymore this is all electronic now
 
02:16:38.810 --> 02:16:38.820 align:start position:0%
and what you heard earlier is exactly
 
02:16:40.549 --> 02:16:40.559 align:start position:0%
right you're going to be tied up I had
 
02:16:43.009 --> 02:16:43.019 align:start position:0%
an officer do a war at noon submit it at
 
02:16:44.629 --> 02:16:44.639 align:start position:0%
seven o'clock that night I called him to
 
02:16:46.129 --> 02:16:46.139 align:start position:0%
see what the status was he hadn't gotten
 
02:16:47.870 --> 02:16:47.880 align:start position:0%
a warrant back yet now I'm gonna have to
 
02:16:50.450 --> 02:16:50.460 align:start position:0%
hold These Guys these Lobster fishermen
 
02:16:52.490 --> 02:16:52.500 align:start position:0%
I'm going to tie them at a pier
 
02:16:54.349 --> 02:16:54.359 align:start position:0%
for six hours while I search for a
 
02:16:55.910 --> 02:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
warrant I I don't know that I'm man
 
02:16:57.889 --> 02:16:57.899 align:start position:0%
enough to do it to Mr Flanagan to be
 
02:17:00.169 --> 02:17:00.179 align:start position:0%
honest with you quite frankly can you
 
02:17:01.429 --> 02:17:01.439 align:start position:0%
think about that though you're going to
 
02:17:04.250 --> 02:17:04.260 align:start position:0%
cost these guys their living and and and
 
02:17:05.810 --> 02:17:05.820 align:start position:0%
I'll tell you how that's going to work
 
02:17:07.790 --> 02:17:07.800 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to do that I'm not going
 
02:17:09.469 --> 02:17:09.479 align:start position:0%
to cost these guys their boat or their
 
02:17:11.209 --> 02:17:11.219 align:start position:0%
living so they're going to go unchecked
 
02:17:13.490 --> 02:17:13.500 align:start position:0%
and if they go unchecked our resources
 
02:17:15.349 --> 02:17:15.359 align:start position:0%
are going to pay that price everybody's
 
02:17:16.969 --> 02:17:16.979 align:start position:0%
going to lose from that because I'm not
 
02:17:18.410 --> 02:17:18.420 align:start position:0%
going to allow that to happen you can't
 
02:17:20.870 --> 02:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
allow that to happen so it's important
 
02:17:22.549 --> 02:17:22.559 align:start position:0%
that these and and these regulatory
 
02:17:24.469 --> 02:17:24.479 align:start position:0%
Powers exist in many places border
 
02:17:26.270 --> 02:17:26.280 align:start position:0%
searches Department of Motor Vehicle
 
02:17:28.490 --> 02:17:28.500 align:start position:0%
truck guys can go on and check logs it's
 
02:17:32.030 --> 02:17:32.040 align:start position:0%
not just us it's not just us
 
02:17:34.730 --> 02:17:34.740 align:start position:0%
if you could the same powers and
 
02:17:36.169 --> 02:17:36.179 align:start position:0%
authorities that you have are no
 
02:17:37.129 --> 02:17:37.139 align:start position:0%
different than the powers and
 
02:17:39.049 --> 02:17:39.059 align:start position:0%
authorities than the wildlife police in
 
02:17:41.209 --> 02:17:41.219 align:start position:0%
Maine Massachusetts Vermont you don't
 
02:17:43.129 --> 02:17:43.139 align:start position:0%
have some this is across the state and I
 
02:17:45.049 --> 02:17:45.059 align:start position:0%
also have a California the one I'm the
 
02:17:47.330 --> 02:17:47.340 align:start position:0%
the most amazing and I hope I don't
 
02:17:49.129 --> 02:17:49.139 align:start position:0%
offend anyone but I think the state of
 
02:17:50.509 --> 02:17:50.519 align:start position:0%
California is probably the most liberal
 
02:17:52.370 --> 02:17:52.380 align:start position:0%
state in the country the state of
 
02:17:54.490 --> 02:17:54.500 align:start position:0%
California took this it's it was RSA
 
02:17:56.929 --> 02:17:56.939 align:start position:0%
2012 in the state of California on a
 
02:17:59.450 --> 02:17:59.460 align:start position:0%
lobster fisherman guys they they took
 
02:18:01.669 --> 02:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
this case up and they made the exact
 
02:18:04.310 --> 02:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
same decision in California I still
 
02:18:06.530 --> 02:18:06.540 align:start position:0%
can't get over the fact if this exists
 
02:18:07.910 --> 02:18:07.920 align:start position:0%
across the country there's only one
 
02:18:10.129 --> 02:18:10.139 align:start position:0%
state I know of uh chairman Roy that
 
02:18:12.230 --> 02:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't allow this and it's uh North
 
02:18:14.209 --> 02:18:14.219 align:start position:0%
Carolina I believe every other state has
 
02:18:16.610 --> 02:18:16.620 align:start position:0%
some version of this yes and and when
 
02:18:19.250 --> 02:18:19.260 align:start position:0%
you speak to Authority a State Trooper
 
02:18:21.650 --> 02:18:21.660 align:start position:0%
can stop a vehicle for speeding they can
 
02:18:23.690 --> 02:18:23.700 align:start position:0%
stop a drunk they can check a fishing
 
02:18:25.190 --> 02:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
license they can make a night hunting
 
02:18:27.950 --> 02:18:27.960 align:start position:0%
case if they so desire they can enforce
 
02:18:30.049 --> 02:18:30.059 align:start position:0%
criminal law a fish and game officer can
 
02:18:32.750 --> 02:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
stop at DWI we can enforce a burglary if
 
02:18:35.209 --> 02:18:35.219 align:start position:0%
we want to we can do fish and game law a
 
02:18:37.310 --> 02:18:37.320 align:start position:0%
county sheriff has we all have the same
 
02:18:39.530 --> 02:18:39.540 align:start position:0%
Powers everybody goes to the same
 
02:18:41.750 --> 02:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
Academy we get the same training same
 
02:18:43.790 --> 02:18:43.800 align:start position:0%
certification we all kind of the only
 
02:18:46.490 --> 02:18:46.500 align:start position:0%
difference is Troopers can't go into a
 
02:18:48.230 --> 02:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
town and I can't even quote it
 
02:18:50.870 --> 02:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
accurately under assert over a certain
 
02:18:52.790 --> 02:18:52.800 align:start position:0%
population without permission I think is
 
02:18:55.129 --> 02:18:55.139 align:start position:0%
the only thing so other than that we're
 
02:18:57.290 --> 02:18:57.300 align:start position:0%
all on this it's a wives tale that we
 
02:18:59.150 --> 02:18:59.160 align:start position:0%
have secret powers you know I'd like to
 
02:19:01.070 --> 02:19:01.080 align:start position:0%
say we do but we don't we don't we're
 
02:19:03.530 --> 02:19:03.540 align:start position:0%
the same as everybody else
 
02:19:05.870 --> 02:19:05.880 align:start position:0%
with regard to California I think that
 
02:19:08.389 --> 02:19:08.399 align:start position:0%
nothing is more bipartisan than Wildlife
 
02:19:08.399 --> 02:19:10.009 align:start position:0%
nothing is more bipartisan than Wildlife
right

02:19:10.009 --> 02:19:10.019 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:19:11.750 --> 02:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
um there'd be no further questions I
 
02:19:16.129 --> 02:19:16.139 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:18.889 --> 02:19:18.899 align:start position:0%
I I'm just wondering what happens on the
 
02:19:21.049 --> 02:19:21.059 align:start position:0%
weekend in terms of you getting warrants
 
02:19:23.450 --> 02:19:23.460 align:start position:0%
so it makes it more difficult because
 
02:19:25.969 --> 02:19:25.979 align:start position:0%
you've got to locate you call a I
 
02:19:29.450 --> 02:19:29.460 align:start position:0%
believe we call a central number now
 
02:19:31.730 --> 02:19:31.740 align:start position:0%
on-call judge they put a judge on call
 
02:19:33.349 --> 02:19:33.359 align:start position:0%
and you have to wait for that and so
 
02:19:36.349 --> 02:19:36.359 align:start position:0%
that does involve if I had someone if my
 
02:19:39.049 --> 02:19:39.059 align:start position:0%
officers had someone that they felt uh
 
02:19:41.030 --> 02:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
they had a home that they thought a deer
 
02:19:42.650 --> 02:19:42.660 align:start position:0%
was brought into and they're pretty sure
 
02:19:43.790 --> 02:19:43.800 align:start position:0%
the deer was in there they're going to
 
02:19:45.349 --> 02:19:45.359 align:start position:0%
do a warrant we would sit on that home
 
02:19:47.629 --> 02:19:47.639 align:start position:0%
until that judge signed a warrant you
 
02:19:48.770 --> 02:19:48.780 align:start position:0%
can't leave because they're going to get
 
02:19:50.270 --> 02:19:50.280 align:start position:0%
rid of that evidence so you have to sit
 
02:19:52.130 --> 02:19:52.140 align:start position:0%
on it and I'd also ask you to bear in
 
02:19:54.050 --> 02:19:54.060 align:start position:0%
mind that we've got 35 field officers in
 
02:19:56.030 --> 02:19:56.040 align:start position:0%
the entire state the city of Concord has
 
02:19:57.590 --> 02:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
50 police officers covering the city
 
02:19:59.450 --> 02:19:59.460 align:start position:0%
Concord I'm covering from Pittsburgh
 
02:20:02.330 --> 02:20:02.340 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts from Vermont to Maine with
 
02:20:05.570 --> 02:20:05.580 align:start position:0%
35. so that would put a huge burden on
 
02:20:07.190 --> 02:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
there are going to be other big balls
 
02:20:09.290 --> 02:20:09.300 align:start position:0%
dropped basically if we have to do that
 
02:20:12.530 --> 02:20:12.540 align:start position:0%
certainly thank you thank you
 
02:20:14.870 --> 02:20:14.880 align:start position:0%

okay

02:21:23.650 --> 02:21:23.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:31.190 --> 02:21:31.200 align:start position:0%

Jane walner and I'm a state
 
02:21:40.070 --> 02:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
representative from right here in
 
02:21:43.849 --> 02:21:43.859 align:start position:0%
Concord you're almost sitting in my ward
 
02:21:43.859 --> 02:21:44.990 align:start position:0%
Concord you're almost sitting in my ward
um

02:21:44.990 --> 02:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:50.270 --> 02:21:50.280 align:start position:0%
so House Bill 504 was the request of Me
 
02:21:53.210 --> 02:21:53.220 align:start position:0%
by the uh the chair of the parole board
 
02:21:56.570 --> 02:21:56.580 align:start position:0%
requested this piece of legislation and
 
02:21:58.969 --> 02:21:58.979 align:start position:0%
what the bill would do would allow the
 
02:22:01.910 --> 02:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
chair of the board to appoint previous
 
02:22:05.870 --> 02:22:05.880 align:start position:0%
board members to sit on the board as
 
02:22:05.880 --> 02:22:06.950 align:start position:0%
board members to sit on the board as
needed

02:22:06.950 --> 02:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
needed
 
02:22:09.950 --> 02:22:09.960 align:start position:0%
and what he finds is sometimes he has a
 
02:22:12.590 --> 02:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
situation where he can't
 
02:22:16.070 --> 02:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
um all he can't um find three parole
 
02:22:17.870 --> 02:22:17.880 align:start position:0%
board members that are available for
 
02:22:22.250 --> 02:22:22.260 align:start position:0%
hearings and this would allow him to use
 
02:22:25.309 --> 02:22:25.319 align:start position:0%
one of the previous board members and
 
02:22:27.730 --> 02:22:27.740 align:start position:0%
the bill would appropriate
 
02:22:30.110 --> 02:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
there would be a stipend of three
 
02:22:33.590 --> 02:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars a day and he's asked for
 
02:22:36.469 --> 02:22:36.479 align:start position:0%
five days a year that he would be able
 
02:22:39.710 --> 02:22:39.720 align:start position:0%
to have a previous board member sit in
 
02:22:43.250 --> 02:22:43.260 align:start position:0%
when he didn't have enough enough parole
 
02:22:45.950 --> 02:22:45.960 align:start position:0%
board members present the bill also
 
02:22:47.809 --> 02:22:47.819 align:start position:0%
raises the stipends to parole board
 
02:22:50.450 --> 02:22:50.460 align:start position:0%
members from twenty thousand a year to
 
02:22:52.790 --> 02:22:52.800 align:start position:0%
thirty thousand a year and raises the
 
02:22:55.130 --> 02:22:55.140 align:start position:0%
vice chair's reimbursement from twenty
 
02:22:57.830 --> 02:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
thousand to forty thousand the chair is
 
02:23:01.309 --> 02:23:01.319 align:start position:0%
a full-time unclassified state employee
 
02:23:04.490 --> 02:23:04.500 align:start position:0%
the bill we provide fifty one thousand
 
02:23:06.469 --> 02:23:06.479 align:start position:0%
five hundred dollars a year to cover the
 
02:23:08.389 --> 02:23:08.399 align:start position:0%
cost of the new parole board members
 
02:23:08.399 --> 02:23:10.190 align:start position:0%
cost of the new parole board members
stipends

02:23:10.190 --> 02:23:10.200 align:start position:0%
stipends
 
02:23:13.130 --> 02:23:13.140 align:start position:0%
and uh last year the parole board dealt
 
02:23:16.429 --> 02:23:16.439 align:start position:0%
with over a thousand cases
 
02:23:19.309 --> 02:23:19.319 align:start position:0%
their work is complicated
 
02:23:24.530 --> 02:23:24.540 align:start position:0%
complex and very important to our state
 
02:23:28.429 --> 02:23:28.439 align:start position:0%
I urge you to vote this bill out ought
 
02:23:30.349 --> 02:23:30.359 align:start position:0%
to pass send it on to the finance
 
02:23:32.210 --> 02:23:32.220 align:start position:0%
committee so the finance committee can
 
02:23:35.330 --> 02:23:35.340 align:start position:0%
look at the financial aspects of the
 
02:23:39.290 --> 02:23:39.300 align:start position:0%
bill chair Roger Phillips is here and
 
02:23:41.630 --> 02:23:41.640 align:start position:0%
he'll go into detail about the work of
 
02:23:43.910 --> 02:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
the board and this piece of legislation
 
02:23:47.150 --> 02:23:47.160 align:start position:0%
and how important it is to them and I
 
02:23:49.190 --> 02:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
thank you and I'm open to questions but
 
02:23:52.429 --> 02:23:52.439 align:start position:0%
I think Mr Phillips would certainly be
 
02:23:54.650 --> 02:23:54.660 align:start position:0%
able to answer most things better than I
 
02:23:54.660 --> 02:23:56.690 align:start position:0%
able to answer most things better than I
can

02:23:56.690 --> 02:23:56.700 align:start position:0%
can
 
02:24:01.070 --> 02:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:02.570 --> 02:24:02.580 align:start position:0%

appreciate the sponsorship I thought I'd
 
02:25:05.870 --> 02:25:05.880 align:start position:0%
Begin by just giving a brief overview of
 
02:25:09.170 --> 02:25:09.180 align:start position:0%
the parole board and its functions and
 
02:25:12.190 --> 02:25:12.200 align:start position:0%
and why we're asking for the
 
02:25:16.630 --> 02:25:16.640 align:start position:0%
the changes in this bill
 
02:25:20.150 --> 02:25:20.160 align:start position:0%
excuse me the I went to the doctor last
 
02:25:23.210 --> 02:25:23.220 align:start position:0%
Friday and they discovered I have
 
02:25:25.010 --> 02:25:25.020 align:start position:0%
um an allergy during the winter time
 
02:25:28.190 --> 02:25:28.200 align:start position:0%
which is a little bit unusual uh after
 
02:25:31.010 --> 02:25:31.020 align:start position:0%
being 43 years in one house by moving
 
02:25:32.809 --> 02:25:32.819 align:start position:0%
into another we discover there are
 
02:25:36.170 --> 02:25:36.180 align:start position:0%
certain ambiggins of it so it it has
 
02:25:38.150 --> 02:25:38.160 align:start position:0%
affected my voice and sometimes I have
 
02:25:40.610 --> 02:25:40.620 align:start position:0%
to clear my throat a bit but please bear
 
02:25:42.349 --> 02:25:42.359 align:start position:0%
with me
 
02:25:43.969 --> 02:25:43.979 align:start position:0%
um the
 
02:25:46.790 --> 02:25:46.800 align:start position:0%
the parole board is a five-member board
 
02:25:48.710 --> 02:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
of which I am
 
02:25:52.370 --> 02:25:52.380 align:start position:0%
um one I was trying to I was appointed
 
02:25:52.380 --> 02:25:53.650 align:start position:0%
um one I was trying to I was appointed
chairperson

02:25:53.650 --> 02:25:53.660 align:start position:0%
chairperson
 
02:25:56.630 --> 02:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
approximately nine months ago although
 
02:26:00.830 --> 02:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
I've been on the board since 2019.
 
02:26:00.840 --> 02:26:02.990 align:start position:0%
I've been on the board since 2019.
um the

02:26:02.990 --> 02:26:03.000 align:start position:0%
um the
 
02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:03.610 align:start position:0%
um the
um

02:26:03.610 --> 02:26:03.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:07.429 --> 02:26:07.439 align:start position:0%
as representative Wald indicated I am a
 
02:26:09.849 --> 02:26:09.859 align:start position:0%
full-time member an unclassified
 
02:26:13.190 --> 02:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
employee of of the state but the board
 
02:26:15.710 --> 02:26:15.720 align:start position:0%
members are part-time
 
02:26:15.720 --> 02:26:18.190 align:start position:0%
members are part-time
um

02:26:18.190 --> 02:26:18.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:22.190 --> 02:26:22.200 align:start position:0%
the five-member board holds pairings for
 
02:26:26.090 --> 02:26:26.100 align:start position:0%
both parole and for revocations and and
 
02:26:28.849 --> 02:26:28.859 align:start position:0%
other matters too but we hold hearings
 
02:26:33.050 --> 02:26:33.060 align:start position:0%
on Tuesdays and Thursdays of most every
 
02:26:36.349 --> 02:26:36.359 align:start position:0%
week Tuesdays are Pearl revocation days
 
02:26:42.349 --> 02:26:42.359 align:start position:0%
and and Thursdays are Pearl days
 
02:26:42.359 --> 02:26:44.990 align:start position:0%
and and Thursdays are Pearl days
um the

02:26:44.990 --> 02:26:45.000 align:start position:0%
um the
 
02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:45.889 align:start position:0%
um the
um

02:26:45.889 --> 02:26:45.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:48.650 --> 02:26:48.660 align:start position:0%
the statute provides that we should have
 
02:26:53.150 --> 02:26:53.160 align:start position:0%
36 hearings a year for each matter but
 
02:26:57.110 --> 02:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
in fact uh we have more than that and uh
 
02:27:00.590 --> 02:27:00.600 align:start position:0%
and I've attached to that are passed out
 
02:27:04.010 --> 02:27:04.020 align:start position:0%
the what the number of hearings have
 
02:27:07.450 --> 02:27:07.460 align:start position:0%
been usually we're we're into
 
02:27:12.530 --> 02:27:12.540 align:start position:0%
the the 40s 45 hearings in each matter
 
02:27:12.540 --> 02:27:13.910 align:start position:0%
the the 40s 45 hearings in each matter
um

02:27:13.910 --> 02:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:13.920 --> 02:27:15.349 align:start position:0%
um
the

02:27:15.349 --> 02:27:15.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:27:15.359 --> 02:27:22.670 align:start position:0%
the
the

02:27:22.670 --> 02:27:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:25.270 --> 02:27:25.280 align:start position:0%
makeup of the board
 
02:27:29.270 --> 02:27:29.280 align:start position:0%
by Statute requires two attorneys the
 
02:27:31.670 --> 02:27:31.680 align:start position:0%
reason for that is that on revocation
 
02:27:34.929 --> 02:27:34.939 align:start position:0%
days there should be an attorney present
 
02:27:38.210 --> 02:27:38.220 align:start position:0%
because of evidentiary issues or other
 
02:27:40.910 --> 02:27:40.920 align:start position:0%
matters that could arise that where
 
02:27:42.910 --> 02:27:42.920 align:start position:0%
legal expert
 
02:27:46.370 --> 02:27:46.380 align:start position:0%
expertise would be required
 
02:27:49.610 --> 02:27:49.620 align:start position:0%
um but there are also other members of
 
02:27:54.469 --> 02:27:54.479 align:start position:0%
the board by the statute who one from
 
02:27:57.110 --> 02:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
law enforcement or correction experience
 
02:27:57.120 --> 02:27:58.070 align:start position:0%
law enforcement or correction experience
so

02:27:58.070 --> 02:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:28:01.070 --> 02:28:01.080 align:start position:0%
uh one uh
 
02:28:04.370 --> 02:28:04.380 align:start position:0%
who who's familiar with the criminology
 
02:28:04.380 --> 02:28:05.809 align:start position:0%
who who's familiar with the criminology
uh

02:28:05.809 --> 02:28:05.819 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:28:10.010 --> 02:28:10.020 align:start position:0%
uh either through or or teaches the same
 
02:28:12.190 --> 02:28:12.200 align:start position:0%
in post-secondary
 
02:28:16.190 --> 02:28:16.200 align:start position:0%
education or and finally a third member
 
02:28:19.130 --> 02:28:19.140 align:start position:0%
would be at large uh without any
 
02:28:22.510 --> 02:28:22.520 align:start position:0%
specific designation I think
 
02:28:26.450 --> 02:28:26.460 align:start position:0%
we're very pleased to have for
 
02:28:28.969 --> 02:28:28.979 align:start position:0%
representing corrections as someone who
 
02:28:31.490 --> 02:28:31.500 align:start position:0%
was a captain of of the corrections
 
02:28:33.889 --> 02:28:33.899 align:start position:0%
officer in San Quentin who has a vast
 
02:28:35.870 --> 02:28:35.880 align:start position:0%
amount of experience and moved to New
 
02:28:38.450 --> 02:28:38.460 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and is a valuable member of
 
02:28:40.150 --> 02:28:40.160 align:start position:0%
the board
 
02:28:43.190 --> 02:28:43.200 align:start position:0%
we also have a former police officer who
 
02:28:45.590 --> 02:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
teaches on the post-secondary education
 
02:28:47.889 --> 02:28:47.899 align:start position:0%
level as a member
 
02:28:52.370 --> 02:28:52.380 align:start position:0%
and we're also fortunate especially when
 
02:28:54.050 --> 02:28:54.060 align:start position:0%
Medical Bureau matters come around
 
02:28:56.690 --> 02:28:56.700 align:start position:0%
because we have a retired surgeon who is
 
02:28:59.929 --> 02:28:59.939 align:start position:0%
also willing to sit as the at-large
 
02:28:59.939 --> 02:29:01.670 align:start position:0%
also willing to sit as the at-large
member

02:29:01.670 --> 02:29:01.680 align:start position:0%
member
 
02:29:01.680 --> 02:29:02.389 align:start position:0%
member
um

02:29:02.389 --> 02:29:02.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:02.399 --> 02:29:06.050 align:start position:0%
um
the

02:29:06.050 --> 02:29:06.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:06.060 --> 02:29:09.469 align:start position:0%
 
the bill

02:29:09.469 --> 02:29:09.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:09.479 --> 02:29:11.389 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:29:11.389 --> 02:29:11.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:14.030 --> 02:29:14.040 align:start position:0%
during the covert times we discovered as
 
02:29:16.070 --> 02:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
we were trying to schedule hearings
 
02:29:19.250 --> 02:29:19.260 align:start position:0%
there were sometimes difficulty
 
02:29:21.469 --> 02:29:21.479 align:start position:0%
of finding
 
02:29:24.950 --> 02:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
um three members on any given day to sit
 
02:29:28.969 --> 02:29:28.979 align:start position:0%
because of either sickness or
 
02:29:32.389 --> 02:29:32.399 align:start position:0%
um or appointments or or for a conflict
 
02:29:34.969 --> 02:29:34.979 align:start position:0%
of interest or for some reason
 
02:29:37.730 --> 02:29:37.740 align:start position:0%
so just so the same way that courts
 
02:29:41.090 --> 02:29:41.100 align:start position:0%
sometimes can call on retired judges I I
 
02:29:43.849 --> 02:29:43.859 align:start position:0%
thought it might be a good idea that I
 
02:29:45.650 --> 02:29:45.660 align:start position:0%
mean last year we had to cancel two
 
02:29:48.830 --> 02:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
hearings because we we couldn't put the
 
02:29:50.210 --> 02:29:50.220 align:start position:0%
panel together
 
02:29:52.070 --> 02:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
and and I thought well we ought to have
 
02:29:54.590 --> 02:29:54.600 align:start position:0%
some sort of safety valve here so that
 
02:29:57.110 --> 02:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
we could call on those who had served in
 
02:30:00.889 --> 02:30:00.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:05.050 --> 02:30:05.060 align:start position:0%
to sit again and that's why we
 
02:30:08.030 --> 02:30:08.040 align:start position:0%
propose that now it would take some
 
02:30:11.270 --> 02:30:11.280 align:start position:0%
doing because now we're you know years
 
02:30:14.870 --> 02:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
ago all parole packages were were in
 
02:30:17.150 --> 02:30:17.160 align:start position:0%
paper and delivered in cardboard boxes
 
02:30:19.910 --> 02:30:19.920 align:start position:0%
and we'd have to go through stacks of
 
02:30:23.030 --> 02:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
paperwork now fortunately in the digital
 
02:30:26.090 --> 02:30:26.100 align:start position:0%
age we all have an issue laptop
 
02:30:28.370 --> 02:30:28.380 align:start position:0%
computers and we can access everything
 
02:30:30.290 --> 02:30:30.300 align:start position:0%
in that way
 
02:30:33.170 --> 02:30:33.180 align:start position:0%
um so it would take number one we have
 
02:30:35.090 --> 02:30:35.100 align:start position:0%
to find out who'd be willing to serve
 
02:30:36.889 --> 02:30:36.899 align:start position:0%
and there'd be some training involved
 
02:30:40.910 --> 02:30:40.920 align:start position:0%
and then have to go through I.T and get
 
02:30:43.330 --> 02:30:43.340 align:start position:0%
the appropriate
 
02:30:46.490 --> 02:30:46.500 align:start position:0%
training for a person so they could look
 
02:30:48.349 --> 02:30:48.359 align:start position:0%
up what what would
 
02:30:51.469 --> 02:30:51.479 align:start position:0%
doing for a hearing of either revocation
 
02:30:51.479 --> 02:30:53.510 align:start position:0%
doing for a hearing of either revocation
or

02:30:53.510 --> 02:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:30:57.230 --> 02:30:57.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:57.240 --> 02:30:58.250 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:30:58.250 --> 02:30:58.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:30:59.950 --> 02:30:59.960 align:start position:0%
that's it
 
02:31:03.830 --> 02:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
in summary of concerning uh
 
02:31:06.110 --> 02:31:06.120 align:start position:0%
that part and the
 
02:31:09.590 --> 02:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
representative walner indicated that you
 
02:31:11.150 --> 02:31:11.160 align:start position:0%
know we wouldn't think would happen very
 
02:31:13.250 --> 02:31:13.260 align:start position:0%
often but it's only only a fifteen
 
02:31:15.410 --> 02:31:15.420 align:start position:0%
hundred dollar appropriation we would
 
02:31:15.420 --> 02:31:16.550 align:start position:0%
hundred dollar appropriation we would
think

02:31:16.550 --> 02:31:16.560 align:start position:0%
think
 
02:31:16.560 --> 02:31:17.990 align:start position:0%
think
the

02:31:17.990 --> 02:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:31:22.070 --> 02:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
the next section is the
 
02:31:22.080 --> 02:31:23.389 align:start position:0%
the next section is the
um

02:31:23.389 --> 02:31:23.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:31:26.389 --> 02:31:26.399 align:start position:0%
a bit different and that is we're asking
 
02:31:29.030 --> 02:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
for increased compensation
 
02:31:31.309 --> 02:31:31.319 align:start position:0%
and I wanted to go
 
02:31:34.190 --> 02:31:34.200 align:start position:0%
over the fact that at least in my
 
02:31:37.210 --> 02:31:37.220 align:start position:0%
opinion the parole board has a
 
02:31:40.070 --> 02:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
significant role to play in public
 
02:31:40.080 --> 02:31:42.170 align:start position:0%
significant role to play in public
safety

02:31:42.170 --> 02:31:42.180 align:start position:0%
safety
 
02:31:42.180 --> 02:31:42.889 align:start position:0%
safety
um

02:31:42.889 --> 02:31:42.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:31:45.469 --> 02:31:45.479 align:start position:0%
we'd know what board members must be
 
02:31:47.450 --> 02:31:47.460 align:start position:0%
competent they must be well prepared
 
02:31:50.270 --> 02:31:50.280 align:start position:0%
they must be dedicated and willing to
 
02:31:53.990 --> 02:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
thoroughly review parole packets uh in
 
02:31:55.490 --> 02:31:55.500 align:start position:0%
criminal records
 
02:31:58.670 --> 02:31:58.680 align:start position:0%
in a parole matter there are at least 23
 
02:32:01.510 --> 02:32:01.520 align:start position:0%
different subject areas that when
 
02:32:04.309 --> 02:32:04.319 align:start position:0%
board members go through in determining
 
02:32:05.750 --> 02:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
whether or not someone should be
 
02:32:08.870 --> 02:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
entitled to parole
 
02:32:11.389 --> 02:32:11.399 align:start position:0%
and preparation for parole hearings
 
02:32:14.630 --> 02:32:14.640 align:start position:0%
takes a considerable amount of time
 
02:32:16.730 --> 02:32:16.740 align:start position:0%
um I mean
 
02:32:18.830 --> 02:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
I think on average it somewhere between
 
02:32:22.610 --> 02:32:22.620 align:start position:0%
10 and 13 hours to go through the parole
 
02:32:26.950 --> 02:32:26.960 align:start position:0%
packets and and to be prepared uh I I
 
02:32:29.150 --> 02:32:29.160 align:start position:0%
might even take longer than that
 
02:32:32.570 --> 02:32:32.580 align:start position:0%
sometimes I sat in on on a Friday night
 
02:32:35.450 --> 02:32:35.460 align:start position:0%
into spending an hour organizing but I
 
02:32:37.450 --> 02:32:37.460 align:start position:0%
spent a good part of Saturday and
 
02:32:40.030 --> 02:32:40.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes a little bit of Sunday and
 
02:32:42.650 --> 02:32:42.660 align:start position:0%
then again on Monday to get things ready
 
02:32:45.950 --> 02:32:45.960 align:start position:0%
for either the Tuesday or the upcoming
 
02:32:47.929 --> 02:32:47.939 align:start position:0%
Thursday hearings
 
02:32:47.939 --> 02:32:48.530 align:start position:0%
Thursday hearings
um

02:32:48.530 --> 02:32:48.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:51.370 --> 02:32:51.380 align:start position:0%
oh the
 
02:32:55.610 --> 02:32:55.620 align:start position:0%
and the other thing that I I want to uh
 
02:32:57.889 --> 02:32:57.899 align:start position:0%
get across is when
 
02:33:00.110 --> 02:33:00.120 align:start position:0%
the probability that you should be nine
 
02:33:03.770 --> 02:33:03.780 align:start position:0%
members was reduced to five the initial
 
02:33:06.590 --> 02:33:06.600 align:start position:0%
proposal was that each board member
 
02:33:08.929 --> 02:33:08.939 align:start position:0%
would be paid thirty thousand and during
 
02:33:11.690 --> 02:33:11.700 align:start position:0%
the legislative process that was reduced
 
02:33:14.809 --> 02:33:14.819 align:start position:0%
to 20. I think that thirty thousand
 
02:33:17.750 --> 02:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
dollar amount that was initially uh
 
02:33:21.370 --> 02:33:21.380 align:start position:0%
suggested that was by at that time uh
 
02:33:24.530 --> 02:33:24.540 align:start position:0%
chairperson Jennifer Sergeant but she
 
02:33:27.110 --> 02:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
did some research on what Wards were
 
02:33:29.870 --> 02:33:29.880 align:start position:0%
paid in other other states
 
02:33:31.849 --> 02:33:31.859 align:start position:0%
um and and there are a lot of full-time
 
02:33:34.910 --> 02:33:34.920 align:start position:0%
boards even the states a little bit
 
02:33:36.950 --> 02:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
larger than New Hampshire where every
 
02:33:38.929 --> 02:33:38.939 align:start position:0%
board member was paid a hundred thousand
 
02:33:38.939 --> 02:33:39.770 align:start position:0%
board member was paid a hundred thousand
dollars

02:33:39.770 --> 02:33:39.780 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
02:33:43.070 --> 02:33:43.080 align:start position:0%
that we know that in New Hampshire we we
 
02:33:45.770 --> 02:33:45.780 align:start position:0%
do a lot because we do things from for
 
02:33:47.809 --> 02:33:47.819 align:start position:0%
public service members of this
 
02:33:49.790 --> 02:33:49.800 align:start position:0%
legislature are certainly well aware
 
02:33:52.670 --> 02:33:52.680 align:start position:0%
that it's not compensation whereby
 
02:33:55.670 --> 02:33:55.680 align:start position:0%
you're willing to sit and represent the
 
02:33:58.010 --> 02:33:58.020 align:start position:0%
people of New Hampshire
 
02:34:01.429 --> 02:34:01.439 align:start position:0%
um you know I was born and raised in New
 
02:34:03.410 --> 02:34:03.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm well aware of what the
 
02:34:07.550 --> 02:34:07.560 align:start position:0%
court does and my father both Winfield
 
02:34:09.469 --> 02:34:09.479 align:start position:0%
Jade Phillips who who was State
 
02:34:11.570 --> 02:34:11.580 align:start position:0%
Treasurer and Bank commissioner and then
 
02:34:14.510 --> 02:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
served as a member of the House of
 
02:34:18.590 --> 02:34:18.600 align:start position:0%
Representatives and I know how how hard
 
02:34:20.690 --> 02:34:20.700 align:start position:0%
and difficult it is and it's an enormous
 
02:34:21.830 --> 02:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
amount of work
 
02:34:23.990 --> 02:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
but when we're dealing with a state
 
02:34:26.990 --> 02:34:27.000 align:start position:0%
agency I think it's very important that
 
02:34:29.990 --> 02:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
we attract those who are very competent
 
02:34:32.690 --> 02:34:32.700 align:start position:0%
and willing to serve it's a hard job
 
02:34:35.690 --> 02:34:35.700 align:start position:0%
it's not easy and
 
02:34:35.700 --> 02:34:37.010 align:start position:0%
it's not easy and
um

02:34:37.010 --> 02:34:37.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:34:39.950 --> 02:34:39.960 align:start position:0%
uh I just want to give one example
 
02:34:39.960 --> 02:34:40.610 align:start position:0%
uh I just want to give one example
um

02:34:40.610 --> 02:34:40.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:34:43.969 --> 02:34:43.979 align:start position:0%
we had an individual with a vast amount
 
02:34:46.610 --> 02:34:46.620 align:start position:0%
of law enforcement experience he was a
 
02:34:49.370 --> 02:34:49.380 align:start position:0%
member of a metropolitan police force
 
02:34:50.870 --> 02:34:50.880 align:start position:0%
outside the state of New Hampshire
 
02:34:53.030 --> 02:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
you're done with the federal government
 
02:34:57.410 --> 02:34:57.420 align:start position:0%
was a federal law enforcement agency and
 
02:34:59.630 --> 02:34:59.640 align:start position:0%
he he became a member
 
02:34:59.640 --> 02:35:02.210 align:start position:0%
he he became a member
and

02:35:02.210 --> 02:35:02.220 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:35:04.849 --> 02:35:04.859 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden he was hearing all of
 
02:35:07.250 --> 02:35:07.260 align:start position:0%
these things and hearing input from
 
02:35:10.070 --> 02:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
victims and although he was well aware
 
02:35:13.370 --> 02:35:13.380 align:start position:0%
of what you know the the arrest process
 
02:35:16.790 --> 02:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
and convicting someone but to hear the
 
02:35:18.770 --> 02:35:18.780 align:start position:0%
effect on people
 
02:35:21.650 --> 02:35:21.660 align:start position:0%
was such that he couldn't sleep at night
 
02:35:24.410 --> 02:35:24.420 align:start position:0%
and it's not easy putting up with some
 
02:35:29.450 --> 02:35:29.460 align:start position:0%
the the whether it's child abuse or you
 
02:35:33.830 --> 02:35:33.840 align:start position:0%
know some horrific or terrible brutal uh
 
02:35:36.190 --> 02:35:36.200 align:start position:0%
crimes whether it be
 
02:35:40.190 --> 02:35:40.200 align:start position:0%
assault or something was done recklessly
 
02:35:42.469 --> 02:35:42.479 align:start position:0%
but the
 
02:35:45.290 --> 02:35:45.300 align:start position:0%
that it I think it takes a unique
 
02:35:48.050 --> 02:35:48.060 align:start position:0%
individual to sit there
 
02:35:50.870 --> 02:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
um and be fair and impartial
 
02:35:54.290 --> 02:35:54.300 align:start position:0%
and also be able to sleep at night
 
02:35:57.410 --> 02:35:57.420 align:start position:0%
um it's one of those things that we we
 
02:36:00.170 --> 02:36:00.180 align:start position:0%
ought to consider so the reason you know
 
02:36:03.349 --> 02:36:03.359 align:start position:0%
we've I've had experience over the last
 
02:36:05.510 --> 02:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
you know since I've been on the board
 
02:36:08.510 --> 02:36:08.520 align:start position:0%
where someone has resigned and it's been
 
02:36:10.670 --> 02:36:10.680 align:start position:0%
very difficult to find a replacement
 
02:36:13.610 --> 02:36:13.620 align:start position:0%
and that's why I'm urging the committee
 
02:36:16.490 --> 02:36:16.500 align:start position:0%
to to accept the recommendation that
 
02:36:19.010 --> 02:36:19.020 align:start position:0%
there be increased compensation for the
 
02:36:23.870 --> 02:36:23.880 align:start position:0%
board member and then the final part of
 
02:36:27.889 --> 02:36:27.899 align:start position:0%
this is we're also asking for
 
02:36:27.899 --> 02:36:28.910 align:start position:0%
this is we're also asking for
um

02:36:28.910 --> 02:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:36:31.370 --> 02:36:31.380 align:start position:0%
not just thirty thousand for a member
 
02:36:34.610 --> 02:36:34.620 align:start position:0%
but for the vice chair to receive extra
 
02:36:37.370 --> 02:36:37.380 align:start position:0%
compensation of ten thousand dollars a
 
02:36:40.010 --> 02:36:40.020 align:start position:0%
year both the chair
 
02:36:43.670 --> 02:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
and vice chair are the only ones that
 
02:36:47.090 --> 02:36:47.100 align:start position:0%
sign warrants now in our Electronics now
 
02:36:47.100 --> 02:36:48.410 align:start position:0%
sign warrants now in our Electronics now
under

02:36:48.410 --> 02:36:48.420 align:start position:0%
under
 
02:36:50.630 --> 02:36:50.640 align:start position:0%
the statue every board member has
 
02:36:52.610 --> 02:36:52.620 align:start position:0%
Authority but there's a certain process
 
02:36:55.610 --> 02:36:55.620 align:start position:0%
we have to go through so that we make
 
02:36:59.330 --> 02:36:59.340 align:start position:0%
sure that we review the the warrants and
 
02:37:02.150 --> 02:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
once their sign that they're ended in
 
02:37:04.309 --> 02:37:04.319 align:start position:0%
the system electronically and in the
 
02:37:06.050 --> 02:37:06.060 align:start position:0%
right places and the right people to
 
02:37:09.830 --> 02:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
notify and to to prevent errors it's
 
02:37:12.650 --> 02:37:12.660 align:start position:0%
good that two people do that but the
 
02:37:15.410 --> 02:37:15.420 align:start position:0%
vice chair also gets involved in
 
02:37:18.050 --> 02:37:18.060 align:start position:0%
other things so certainly for sharing
 
02:37:22.849 --> 02:37:22.859 align:start position:0%
hearings when I can't or or for the
 
02:37:25.309 --> 02:37:25.319 align:start position:0%
Motions that have files sometimes the
 
02:37:28.610 --> 02:37:28.620 align:start position:0%
PPO needs to probation parole officer
 
02:37:31.030 --> 02:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
wants to withdraw a warrant for a reason
 
02:37:33.710 --> 02:37:33.720 align:start position:0%
or there might be changes in control
 
02:37:36.230 --> 02:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
conditions and they're seeking
 
02:37:38.870 --> 02:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
permission and there are lots of of time
 
02:37:42.190 --> 02:37:42.200 align:start position:0%
spent by the Vice chair in doing uh
 
02:37:44.929 --> 02:37:44.939 align:start position:0%
administrative duties that do not have
 
02:37:48.830 --> 02:37:48.840 align:start position:0%
to be performed by the other members of
 
02:37:51.950 --> 02:37:51.960 align:start position:0%
the board so that's why we're we're
 
02:37:54.650 --> 02:37:54.660 align:start position:0%
asking for this change in the the
 
02:37:54.660 --> 02:37:56.510 align:start position:0%
asking for this change in the the
statute

02:37:56.510 --> 02:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
statute
 
02:37:56.520 --> 02:38:00.429 align:start position:0%
statute
um we

02:38:00.429 --> 02:38:00.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:04.309 --> 02:38:04.319 align:start position:0%
we heard in individual cases I think
 
02:38:09.590 --> 02:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
last year more than uh 1400 cases and
 
02:38:12.770 --> 02:38:12.780 align:start position:0%
they're out of both
 
02:38:17.450 --> 02:38:17.460 align:start position:0%
parole and for revocation uh it it takes
 
02:38:20.750 --> 02:38:20.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of effort and dedication on the
 
02:38:22.370 --> 02:38:22.380 align:start position:0%
proud of board members to do their
 
02:38:22.380 --> 02:38:23.469 align:start position:0%
proud of board members to do their
duties

02:38:23.469 --> 02:38:23.479 align:start position:0%
duties
 
02:38:26.809 --> 02:38:26.819 align:start position:0%
and with we would like to see this bill
 
02:38:26.819 --> 02:38:28.670 align:start position:0%
and with we would like to see this bill
passed

02:38:28.670 --> 02:38:28.680 align:start position:0%
passed
 
02:38:32.510 --> 02:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
um we know that over the years there has
 
02:38:34.870 --> 02:38:34.880 align:start position:0%
been a decrease in the prison population
 
02:38:38.450 --> 02:38:38.460 align:start position:0%
uh I mean 10 12 years ago was probably
 
02:38:42.230 --> 02:38:42.240 align:start position:0%
up to three thousand if not it seems to
 
02:38:45.590 --> 02:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
be holding steady now at about 2 000.
 
02:38:49.849 --> 02:38:49.859 align:start position:0%
and I also attached to my presentation
 
02:38:54.230 --> 02:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
the fact that new persons coming in uh
 
02:38:57.889 --> 02:38:57.899 align:start position:0%
that amount is slowly going up I can't
 
02:38:59.990 --> 02:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
predict the future I know that when the
 
02:39:02.150 --> 02:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
governor presented the when we had to
 
02:39:04.910 --> 02:39:04.920 align:start position:0%
talk about presenting our budget and he
 
02:39:07.190 --> 02:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
spoke and said the population of New
 
02:39:10.429 --> 02:39:10.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is increasing uh and I think
 
02:39:13.610 --> 02:39:13.620 align:start position:0%
that's true uh I wish that the increase
 
02:39:15.770 --> 02:39:15.780 align:start position:0%
would only be of law-abiding citizens
 
02:39:18.950 --> 02:39:18.960 align:start position:0%
but that may not be the case so I think
 
02:39:22.790 --> 02:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
we have to be prepared uh to handle
 
02:39:26.090 --> 02:39:26.100 align:start position:0%
whatever workload may be presented and
 
02:39:28.309 --> 02:39:28.319 align:start position:0%
later on today there's a another bill
 
02:39:31.190 --> 02:39:31.200 align:start position:0%
that will also be present to talk about
 
02:39:34.070 --> 02:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
because if that were were passed that'd
 
02:39:36.410 --> 02:39:36.420 align:start position:0%
be even more work for the pro board to
 
02:39:36.420 --> 02:39:37.790 align:start position:0%
be even more work for the pro board to
do

02:39:37.790 --> 02:39:37.800 align:start position:0%
do
 
02:39:40.070 --> 02:39:40.080 align:start position:0%
um but in the
 
02:39:42.710 --> 02:39:42.720 align:start position:0%
um that's the extent of my presentation
 
02:39:44.809 --> 02:39:44.819 align:start position:0%
for today but would be happy to answer
 
02:39:47.690 --> 02:39:47.700 align:start position:0%
any questions that anyone has
 
02:39:51.530 --> 02:39:51.540 align:start position:0%
or if I can't answer I say Mackie my
 
02:39:52.969 --> 02:39:52.979 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:39:54.830 --> 02:39:54.840 align:start position:0%
um I have a question regarding the two
 
02:39:57.170 --> 02:39:57.180 align:start position:0%
days that were canceled so how many
 
02:39:59.330 --> 02:39:59.340 align:start position:0%
cases did you were you unable to hear
 
02:40:01.610 --> 02:40:01.620 align:start position:0%
that day and how long did it take you to
 
02:40:03.410 --> 02:40:03.420 align:start position:0%
get them back in the queue in other
 
02:40:05.570 --> 02:40:05.580 align:start position:0%
words I'm interested in the what what
 
02:40:07.370 --> 02:40:07.380 align:start position:0%
that delay caused the people who were
 
02:40:09.590 --> 02:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
trying to get a parole hearing
 
02:40:12.650 --> 02:40:12.660 align:start position:0%
I I think Jay Mackey director so she had
 
02:40:14.809 --> 02:40:14.819 align:start position:0%
to do that scheduling yeah I I had to
 
02:40:16.070 --> 02:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
take over scheduling when we had a
 
02:40:17.809 --> 02:40:17.819 align:start position:0%
retirement in the office
 
02:40:19.670 --> 02:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
um so when we had the vacancy we had to
 
02:40:22.370 --> 02:40:22.380 align:start position:0%
cancel those two hearings
 
02:40:25.070 --> 02:40:25.080 align:start position:0%
um it was we ended up having to move
 
02:40:26.510 --> 02:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
people that were in the next hearing
 
02:40:28.610 --> 02:40:28.620 align:start position:0%
because people are heard we try to hear
 
02:40:30.170 --> 02:40:30.180 align:start position:0%
them within 60 days of their minimum
 
02:40:32.150 --> 02:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
parole date so they can hopefully get
 
02:40:34.130 --> 02:40:34.140 align:start position:0%
out by their minimum approval date and
 
02:40:35.990 --> 02:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
so we we had to take people from the
 
02:40:38.210 --> 02:40:38.220 align:start position:0%
next parole hearing schedule move them
 
02:40:40.190 --> 02:40:40.200 align:start position:0%
to another one to start fitting some of
 
02:40:41.510 --> 02:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
these people on we started putting them
 
02:40:44.389 --> 02:40:44.399 align:start position:0%
on revocation hearing schedules as well
 
02:40:47.270 --> 02:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
um wherever we could find room over I
 
02:40:49.309 --> 02:40:49.319 align:start position:0%
would say the next month we got to hear
 
02:40:50.630 --> 02:40:50.640 align:start position:0%
all of them so they were still heard
 
02:40:52.550 --> 02:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
within their minimum before the minimum
 
02:40:53.870 --> 02:40:53.880 align:start position:0%
parole date and still had the
 
02:40:55.429 --> 02:40:55.439 align:start position:0%
opportunity to hopefully if they were
 
02:40:57.670 --> 02:40:57.680 align:start position:0%
approved and get a housing plan
 
02:40:59.870 --> 02:40:59.880 align:start position:0%
approved by their minimum they could be
 
02:41:02.690 --> 02:41:02.700 align:start position:0%
released on their minimum
 
02:41:05.870 --> 02:41:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:08.150 --> 02:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
02:41:09.830 --> 02:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:41:12.469 --> 02:41:12.479 align:start position:0%
um I I was listening when you were
 
02:41:14.690 --> 02:41:14.700 align:start position:0%
talking about the preparation right um
 
02:41:19.130 --> 02:41:19.140 align:start position:0%
and and being uh uh bringing a quality
 
02:41:21.050 --> 02:41:21.060 align:start position:0%
um individual to that situation and so
 
02:41:23.389 --> 02:41:23.399 align:start position:0%
my question is when there are situations
 
02:41:25.010 --> 02:41:25.020 align:start position:0%
where someone is ill or something like
 
02:41:26.150 --> 02:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
that there's not a lot of time to
 
02:41:28.910 --> 02:41:28.920 align:start position:0%
prepare so is would would you say that
 
02:41:31.190 --> 02:41:31.200 align:start position:0%
it's possible for someone to substitute
 
02:41:34.010 --> 02:41:34.020 align:start position:0%
in that situation and still bring
 
02:41:36.590 --> 02:41:36.600 align:start position:0%
um and still be properly prepared uh so
 
02:41:38.870 --> 02:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
that they are doing their you know that
 
02:41:40.610 --> 02:41:40.620 align:start position:0%
fulfilling their role to the to the best
 
02:41:44.270 --> 02:41:44.280 align:start position:0%
that they can would would not scheduling
 
02:41:47.090 --> 02:41:47.100 align:start position:0%
this is where we we try to schedule in
 
02:41:47.100 --> 02:41:48.349 align:start position:0%
this is where we we try to schedule in
advance

02:41:48.349 --> 02:41:48.359 align:start position:0%
advance
 
02:41:51.889 --> 02:41:51.899 align:start position:0%
so that might look back for instance in
 
02:41:54.770 --> 02:41:54.780 align:start position:0%
late November we did January February
 
02:41:56.809 --> 02:41:56.819 align:start position:0%
March and I'm working on April May and
 
02:41:56.819 --> 02:41:57.969 align:start position:0%
March and I'm working on April May and
June

02:41:57.969 --> 02:41:57.979 align:start position:0%
June
 
02:42:01.910 --> 02:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
but in those days people the board
 
02:42:04.130 --> 02:42:04.140 align:start position:0%
members submitted me in advance states
 
02:42:06.170 --> 02:42:06.180 align:start position:0%
that they're not going to be available
 
02:42:09.950 --> 02:42:09.960 align:start position:0%
so I will know in advance if there
 
02:42:12.110 --> 02:42:12.120 align:start position:0%
aren't certain members that you know if
 
02:42:14.870 --> 02:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
I can't put together a panel that it's
 
02:42:18.290 --> 02:42:18.300 align:start position:0%
going to be obvious right away so this
 
02:42:21.710 --> 02:42:21.720 align:start position:0%
isn't something where where someone uh
 
02:42:21.720 --> 02:42:23.690 align:start position:0%
isn't something where where someone uh
is

02:42:23.690 --> 02:42:23.700 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:42:26.090 --> 02:42:26.100 align:start position:0%
suddenly ill the day of the hearing and
 
02:42:28.010 --> 02:42:28.020 align:start position:0%
can't make it we're not going to do that
 
02:42:31.130 --> 02:42:31.140 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you but there's a
 
02:42:34.070 --> 02:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
preparation really requires much more
 
02:42:37.910 --> 02:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:40.610 --> 02:42:40.620 align:start position:0%
thank you oh is that it okay thank you
 
02:42:42.530 --> 02:42:42.540 align:start position:0%
for your testimony all right thank you
 
02:42:45.410 --> 02:42:45.420 align:start position:0%
very much I appreciate it is there
 
02:42:46.849 --> 02:42:46.859 align:start position:0%

02:42:48.349 --> 02:42:48.359 align:start position:0%
who has not
 
02:42:50.870 --> 02:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
I mean none I close the public hearing
 
02:42:54.230 --> 02:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
and I opened a public hearing no no oh
 
02:42:56.270 --> 02:42:56.280 align:start position:0%
do I why are we caught up
 
02:43:37.070 --> 02:43:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:37.080 --> 02:44:16.429 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:44:16.429 --> 02:44:16.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:16.439 --> 02:44:43.429 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:44:43.429 --> 02:44:43.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:34.490 --> 02:45:34.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:34.500 --> 02:45:53.510 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:45:53.510 --> 02:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:28.429 --> 02:46:28.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:28.439 --> 02:47:39.650 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:47:39.650 --> 02:47:39.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:58.730 --> 02:47:58.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:00.410 --> 02:48:00.420 align:start position:0%
this time I'm going to open a public
 
02:48:04.130 --> 02:48:04.140 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 545 and recognize
 
02:48:05.929 --> 02:48:05.939 align:start position:0%
the sponsor to introduce his bill
 
02:48:12.410 --> 02:48:12.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:14.450 --> 02:48:14.460 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair Dan Hines a
 
02:48:16.309 --> 02:48:16.319 align:start position:0%
representing town of Bedford and I'm
 
02:48:17.870 --> 02:48:17.880 align:start position:0%
putting this bill to amend the victims
 
02:48:19.309 --> 02:48:19.319 align:start position:0%
Bill of Rights and it does a few
 
02:48:20.330 --> 02:48:20.340 align:start position:0%
different things
 
02:48:22.429 --> 02:48:22.439 align:start position:0%
um so broadly um the first thing it do
 
02:48:24.410 --> 02:48:24.420 align:start position:0%
does is would expand the victim Bill
 
02:48:26.570 --> 02:48:26.580 align:start position:0%
rights to misdemeanor cases uh so
 
02:48:28.790 --> 02:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
presently only applies in felony cases I
 
02:48:30.050 --> 02:48:30.060 align:start position:0%
think it's a good thing to apply it to
 
02:48:31.610 --> 02:48:31.620 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor cases
 
02:48:33.590 --> 02:48:33.600 align:start position:0%
um the next thing it would do is it
 
02:48:35.750 --> 02:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
would allow victims
 
02:48:37.790 --> 02:48:37.800 align:start position:0%
um to have a no contact order moved
 
02:48:41.270 --> 02:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
against them so typically
 
02:48:43.849 --> 02:48:43.859 align:start position:0%
um when someone is arrested mainly for
 
02:48:45.290 --> 02:48:45.300 align:start position:0%
domestic violence cases but it does
 
02:48:47.330 --> 02:48:47.340 align:start position:0%
apply to other cases there is a no
 
02:48:48.650 --> 02:48:48.660 align:start position:0%
contact order issued by the Bell
 
02:48:50.750 --> 02:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner and what happens is people
 
02:48:52.670 --> 02:48:52.680 align:start position:0%
usually don't get an arraignment for a
 
02:48:54.590 --> 02:48:54.600 align:start position:0%
while on some courts it can even be a
 
02:48:56.450 --> 02:48:56.460 align:start position:0%
month out others it's at least a few
 
02:49:00.110 --> 02:49:00.120 align:start position:0%
weeks but what happens often is that the
 
02:49:01.910 --> 02:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
victim doesn't want there to be a no
 
02:49:03.410 --> 02:49:03.420 align:start position:0%
contact order
 
02:49:06.710 --> 02:49:06.720 align:start position:0%
um so I mean one example is if
 
02:49:09.710 --> 02:49:09.720 align:start position:0%
um a mother is accused of some form of
 
02:49:11.090 --> 02:49:11.100 align:start position:0%
domestic violence symbol assault
 
02:49:13.070 --> 02:49:13.080 align:start position:0%
something like that um against the
 
02:49:14.809 --> 02:49:14.819 align:start position:0%
father typically the battle commissioner
 
02:49:16.190 --> 02:49:16.200 align:start position:0%
would say well you can't go to the home
 
02:49:17.650 --> 02:49:17.660 align:start position:0%
you can't have contact with the person
 
02:49:20.450 --> 02:49:20.460 align:start position:0%
even through phone or anything like that
 
02:49:22.370 --> 02:49:22.380 align:start position:0%
so that's typically what I would see in
 
02:49:25.309 --> 02:49:25.319 align:start position:0%
most cases and so often that is very
 
02:49:27.469 --> 02:49:27.479 align:start position:0%
destructive to families
 
02:49:29.809 --> 02:49:29.819 align:start position:0%
um oftentimes the person who has the
 
02:49:32.090 --> 02:49:32.100 align:start position:0%
restraining order put against them they
 
02:49:33.889 --> 02:49:33.899 align:start position:0%
don't want it they want that person to
 
02:49:35.389 --> 02:49:35.399 align:start position:0%
be able to come home they want to
 
02:49:38.030 --> 02:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
continue maintaining their house and
 
02:49:39.050 --> 02:49:39.060 align:start position:0%
especially when there's children
 
02:49:41.809 --> 02:49:41.819 align:start position:0%
involved oftentimes it does require both
 
02:49:43.630 --> 02:49:43.640 align:start position:0%
parents to be involved with that child
 
02:49:45.650 --> 02:49:45.660 align:start position:0%
particularly you know if someone's in
 
02:49:47.210 --> 02:49:47.220 align:start position:0%
school and someone's typically there for
 
02:49:49.550 --> 02:49:49.560 align:start position:0%
the child afterwards so it can be very
 
02:49:50.870 --> 02:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
disruptive just to have these male
 
02:49:52.429 --> 02:49:52.439 align:start position:0%
conditions in place so what this would
 
02:49:54.830 --> 02:49:54.840 align:start position:0%
do would allow the victim to say I don't
 
02:49:56.990 --> 02:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
want that Belk Edition in place or no
 
02:49:59.809 --> 02:49:59.819 align:start position:0%
contact or part of the vacuum condition
 
02:50:01.490 --> 02:50:01.500 align:start position:0%
um they could even
 
02:50:02.750 --> 02:50:02.760 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't have to remove it all
 
02:50:03.950 --> 02:50:03.960 align:start position:0%
together if they wanted they could say
 
02:50:05.150 --> 02:50:05.160 align:start position:0%
well I just want to be able to talk to
 
02:50:06.469 --> 02:50:06.479 align:start position:0%
person over the phone I want to text
 
02:50:09.110 --> 02:50:09.120 align:start position:0%
them I want to email them or I want to
 
02:50:10.969 --> 02:50:10.979 align:start position:0%
have contacted with them as long as the
 
02:50:12.830 --> 02:50:12.840 align:start position:0%
third person's there so that would also
 
02:50:12.840 --> 02:50:13.550 align:start position:0%
third person's there so that would also
be

02:50:13.550 --> 02:50:13.560 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:50:16.730 --> 02:50:16.740 align:start position:0%
um they're right to do so and presently
 
02:50:19.849 --> 02:50:19.859 align:start position:0%
if the victim wants to bail condition
 
02:50:21.770 --> 02:50:21.780 align:start position:0%
um no contact order removed they have to
 
02:50:23.450 --> 02:50:23.460 align:start position:0%
go and find a judge and the judge has to
 
02:50:25.070 --> 02:50:25.080 align:start position:0%
approve it uh sometimes judges do
 
02:50:26.929 --> 02:50:26.939 align:start position:0%
sometimes they don't sometimes it
 
02:50:28.550 --> 02:50:28.560 align:start position:0%
depends on the process computer's input
 
02:50:30.590 --> 02:50:30.600 align:start position:0%
but either way it does take a while to
 
02:50:31.849 --> 02:50:31.859 align:start position:0%
actually get to court to have these
 
02:50:34.309 --> 02:50:34.319 align:start position:0%
things happen so this would just allow
 
02:50:36.050 --> 02:50:36.060 align:start position:0%
the victim to have a right to have that
 
02:50:39.230 --> 02:50:39.240 align:start position:0%
no contact order removed the second
 
02:50:41.809 --> 02:50:41.819 align:start position:0%
thing or one other thing you would do is
 
02:50:43.610 --> 02:50:43.620 align:start position:0%
allow what's called an accordion
 
02:50:45.830 --> 02:50:45.840 align:start position:0%
satisfaction so Massachusetts has this
 
02:50:48.770 --> 02:50:48.780 align:start position:0%
basically an accordion satisfaction is a
 
02:50:50.510 --> 02:50:50.520 align:start position:0%
victim would come to some agreement
 
02:50:53.270 --> 02:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
saying okay I'm essentially made whole
 
02:50:55.370 --> 02:50:55.380 align:start position:0%
as a result of what you've done and I
 
02:50:57.650 --> 02:50:57.660 align:start position:0%
want the charge dismissed so things
 
02:50:59.750 --> 02:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
where it can typically arise is I think
 
02:51:01.429 --> 02:51:01.439 align:start position:0%
shoplifting is a good case for it where
 
02:51:03.170 --> 02:51:03.180 align:start position:0%
or I mean at the end of the day the shop
 
02:51:04.969 --> 02:51:04.979 align:start position:0%
owner typically wants their money back
 
02:51:06.710 --> 02:51:06.720 align:start position:0%
is a form of restitution they might be
 
02:51:08.450 --> 02:51:08.460 align:start position:0%
fine with that
 
02:51:10.309 --> 02:51:10.319 align:start position:0%
um it could arise in destruction of
 
02:51:11.809 --> 02:51:11.819 align:start position:0%
property cases
 
02:51:13.790 --> 02:51:13.800 align:start position:0%
um it also could rise in simple assault
 
02:51:16.070 --> 02:51:16.080 align:start position:0%
cases and it's not necessarily limited
 
02:51:19.790 --> 02:51:19.800 align:start position:0%
to money so it could include having the
 
02:51:21.710 --> 02:51:21.720 align:start position:0%
essentially defendant
 
02:51:24.050 --> 02:51:24.060 align:start position:0%
um commit or uh commit
 
02:51:27.410 --> 02:51:27.420 align:start position:0%
um have to complete counseling we could
 
02:51:30.050 --> 02:51:30.060 align:start position:0%
involve other treatment it could involve
 
02:51:32.210 --> 02:51:32.220 align:start position:0%
different things and
 
02:51:35.090 --> 02:51:35.100 align:start position:0%
um so it's not limited just to money and
 
02:51:37.490 --> 02:51:37.500 align:start position:0%
there is a typo on my bill on that line
 
02:51:41.510 --> 02:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
for the it's line 11. I did ask OLS to
 
02:51:42.950 --> 02:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
draft an amendment
 
02:51:44.690 --> 02:51:44.700 align:start position:0%
um but it presently reads to have a
 
02:51:46.490 --> 02:51:46.500 align:start position:0%
charge against them dismissed that's
 
02:51:48.110 --> 02:51:48.120 align:start position:0%
supposed to read a charge against the
 
02:51:50.750 --> 02:51:50.760 align:start position:0%
defendant dismissed so I do have a
 
02:51:52.190 --> 02:51:52.200 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment for that just to fix
 
02:51:54.230 --> 02:51:54.240 align:start position:0%
that typo
 
02:51:56.269 --> 02:51:56.279 align:start position:0%
um another thing that I think is less
 
02:51:57.950 --> 02:51:57.960 align:start position:0%
common is to have a victim have a right
 
02:52:00.170 --> 02:52:00.180 align:start position:0%
to withdraw withdraw restitution after
 
02:52:01.790 --> 02:52:01.800 align:start position:0%
the fact so
 
02:52:03.650 --> 02:52:03.660 align:start position:0%
um the reason I put this in is I saw a
 
02:52:05.690 --> 02:52:05.700 align:start position:0%
case who's in a different state
 
02:52:07.490 --> 02:52:07.500 align:start position:0%
um where essentially someone had
 
02:52:10.969 --> 02:52:10.979 align:start position:0%
restitution amounts it was a lot
 
02:52:12.110 --> 02:52:12.120 align:start position:0%
um and it was really preventing the
 
02:52:14.269 --> 02:52:14.279 align:start position:0%
person sorry getting back on track and
 
02:52:15.650 --> 02:52:15.660 align:start position:0%
the person
 
02:52:18.650 --> 02:52:18.660 align:start position:0%
um the victim just lined it to go away
 
02:52:20.330 --> 02:52:20.340 align:start position:0%
so I don't think this would be used a
 
02:52:23.090 --> 02:52:23.100 align:start position:0%
lot but I think um restitution since it
 
02:52:24.590 --> 02:52:24.600 align:start position:0%
is supposed to make someone whole that
 
02:52:25.910 --> 02:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
they should be the one deciding whether
 
02:52:28.070 --> 02:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
they actually want to terminate it so I
 
02:52:29.150 --> 02:52:29.160 align:start position:0%
don't think it'll happen a lot but I
 
02:52:30.290 --> 02:52:30.300 align:start position:0%
think it's a good option to give people
 
02:52:32.450 --> 02:52:32.460 align:start position:0%
and then finally this just makes it
 
02:52:35.269 --> 02:52:35.279 align:start position:0%
clear that um departments shall provide
 
02:52:37.370 --> 02:52:37.380 align:start position:0%
a copy of this victim's Bill of Rights
 
02:52:39.650 --> 02:52:39.660 align:start position:0%
to victim in cases
 
02:52:44.030 --> 02:52:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:45.469 --> 02:52:45.479 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:52:47.090 --> 02:52:47.100 align:start position:0%
um I have a question
 
02:52:49.370 --> 02:52:49.380 align:start position:0%
do you have any concerns about
 
02:52:49.380 --> 02:52:50.809 align:start position:0%
do you have any concerns about
um

02:52:50.809 --> 02:52:50.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:52:53.150 --> 02:52:53.160 align:start position:0%
victims being pressured into dropping
 
02:52:53.160 --> 02:52:54.349 align:start position:0%
victims being pressured into dropping
charges

02:52:54.349 --> 02:52:54.359 align:start position:0%
charges
 
02:52:57.349 --> 02:52:57.359 align:start position:0%
um because of a thing like this where
 
02:52:59.990 --> 02:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
um they don't necessarily have access to
 
02:53:02.990 --> 02:53:03.000 align:start position:0%
to someone to advocate for them and if
 
02:53:05.809 --> 02:53:05.819 align:start position:0%
if the offender is
 
02:53:07.370 --> 02:53:07.380 align:start position:0%
putting pressure on them hey just drop
 
02:53:08.990 --> 02:53:09.000 align:start position:0%
these charges everything will be fine
 
02:53:11.809 --> 02:53:11.819 align:start position:0%
that type of thing yeah so I think
 
02:53:15.290 --> 02:53:15.300 align:start position:0%
victims would have access to I mean I I
 
02:53:16.190 --> 02:53:16.200 align:start position:0%
don't know if it's all police
 
02:53:17.929 --> 02:53:17.939 align:start position:0%
departments but I think a lot of them do
 
02:53:19.730 --> 02:53:19.740 align:start position:0%
have victim witness Advocates so there
 
02:53:21.469 --> 02:53:21.479 align:start position:0%
are someone that they can talk to in
 
02:53:22.910 --> 02:53:22.920 align:start position:0%
that regard
 
02:53:22.920 --> 02:53:23.690 align:start position:0%
that regard
um

02:53:23.690 --> 02:53:23.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:53:26.330 --> 02:53:26.340 align:start position:0%
there's I guess there's separate crimes
 
02:53:29.809 --> 02:53:29.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:32.450 --> 02:53:32.460 align:start position:0%
I'd have to look at the exact language
 
02:53:34.490 --> 02:53:34.500 align:start position:0%
um I I think the simple example I can
 
02:53:36.349 --> 02:53:36.359 align:start position:0%
think of off the top of my head is if I
 
02:53:38.210 --> 02:53:38.220 align:start position:0%
threaten someone don't go to court or
 
02:53:38.220 --> 02:53:39.469 align:start position:0%
threaten someone don't go to court or
whatever

02:53:39.469 --> 02:53:39.479 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
02:53:41.450 --> 02:53:41.460 align:start position:0%
um so in regards to coercion I would
 
02:53:43.910 --> 02:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
have to look at that specific language
 
02:53:43.920 --> 02:53:44.690 align:start position:0%
have to look at that specific language
um

02:53:44.690 --> 02:53:44.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:53:47.269 --> 02:53:47.279 align:start position:0%
so yes I I don't want people to be
 
02:53:48.769 --> 02:53:48.779 align:start position:0%
allowed to course people so I would
 
02:53:50.210 --> 02:53:50.220 align:start position:0%
support an amendment that I guess makes
 
02:53:50.220 --> 02:53:51.469 align:start position:0%
support an amendment that I guess makes
it

02:53:51.469 --> 02:53:51.479 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:53:53.450 --> 02:53:53.460 align:start position:0%
not coercive I'm not sure the best
 
02:53:55.969 --> 02:53:55.979 align:start position:0%
language that would be used for that but
 
02:53:57.110 --> 02:53:57.120 align:start position:0%
I would support
 
02:54:00.410 --> 02:54:00.420 align:start position:0%
um that type of concern to be addressed
 
02:54:04.610 --> 02:54:04.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:06.530 --> 02:54:06.540 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chair actually that was
 
02:54:08.690 --> 02:54:08.700 align:start position:0%
the question I was going to ask
 
02:54:11.630 --> 02:54:11.640 align:start position:0%
um but I have seen this situation and if
 
02:54:13.550 --> 02:54:13.560 align:start position:0%
this is also in a different state
 
02:54:14.870 --> 02:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
um where it was something that was
 
02:54:17.330 --> 02:54:17.340 align:start position:0%
prolonged it was mandated by the state
 
02:54:19.190 --> 02:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
and that it was prolonged and and there
 
02:54:20.570 --> 02:54:20.580 align:start position:0%
were situations that were run into
 
02:54:22.849 --> 02:54:22.859 align:start position:0%
because of that or restraining order
 
02:54:24.410 --> 02:54:24.420 align:start position:0%
um but I haven't seen that in New
 
02:54:26.690 --> 02:54:26.700 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and it seems to me that there
 
02:54:29.870 --> 02:54:29.880 align:start position:0%
is a recourse there is a way to go
 
02:54:31.190 --> 02:54:31.200 align:start position:0%
through a judge and do that it just
 
02:54:33.410 --> 02:54:33.420 align:start position:0%
takes a you know takes a little bit of
 
02:54:34.969 --> 02:54:34.979 align:start position:0%
time first of all uh so my first
 
02:54:37.190 --> 02:54:37.200 align:start position:0%
question is do you know about how long
 
02:54:39.530 --> 02:54:39.540 align:start position:0%
that takes and
 
02:54:40.910 --> 02:54:40.920 align:start position:0%
um I'm just trying to determine if
 
02:54:42.410 --> 02:54:42.420 align:start position:0%
that's actually cumbersome or if it
 
02:54:43.610 --> 02:54:43.620 align:start position:0%
could be protective in the situation
 
02:54:45.050 --> 02:54:45.060 align:start position:0%
where someone would be coerced or
 
02:54:49.490 --> 02:54:49.500 align:start position:0%
something yep so in my experience the
 
02:54:50.750 --> 02:54:50.760 align:start position:0%
first chance they're gonna get in front
 
02:54:52.790 --> 02:54:52.800 align:start position:0%
of the judge is the arraignment um so
 
02:54:54.230 --> 02:54:54.240 align:start position:0%
often courts don't even have a file
 
02:54:55.490 --> 02:54:55.500 align:start position:0%
before then
 
02:54:58.010 --> 02:54:58.020 align:start position:0%
um so I've tried to file basically
 
02:55:01.730 --> 02:55:01.740 align:start position:0%
emergency motions to get it amended and
 
02:55:03.469 --> 02:55:03.479 align:start position:0%
if there's good reason courts tend to
 
02:55:06.290 --> 02:55:06.300 align:start position:0%
hear them sooner but even in the recent
 
02:55:08.809 --> 02:55:08.819 align:start position:0%
case I'm thinking that I mean it was it
 
02:55:10.370 --> 02:55:10.380 align:start position:0%
was probably like a week still um
 
02:55:12.110 --> 02:55:12.120 align:start position:0%
sometimes you can get a judge to do it
 
02:55:13.670 --> 02:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
super fast
 
02:55:15.530 --> 02:55:15.540 align:start position:0%
um but I think the typical time that
 
02:55:17.269 --> 02:55:17.279 align:start position:0%
would be dressed is at the arraignment
 
02:55:19.730 --> 02:55:19.740 align:start position:0%
and that can range anywhere from I mean
 
02:55:22.070 --> 02:55:22.080 align:start position:0%
I guess the next day if someone's held
 
02:55:24.050 --> 02:55:24.060 align:start position:0%
or typically in my experience it's
 
02:55:26.210 --> 02:55:26.220 align:start position:0%
probably going to be roughly around a
 
02:55:28.370 --> 02:55:28.380 align:start position:0%
month so probably two to six weeks is
 
02:55:34.090 --> 02:55:34.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:37.130 --> 02:55:37.140 align:start position:0%
representative Selleck thank you Mr
 
02:55:39.590 --> 02:55:39.600 align:start position:0%
chair very quick question
 
02:55:42.290 --> 02:55:42.300 align:start position:0%
um your Bill calls itself the amending
 
02:55:44.870 --> 02:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
the victim's Bill of Rights and I just
 
02:55:47.210 --> 02:55:47.220 align:start position:0%
want to clarify by the victim you mean
 
02:55:49.849 --> 02:55:49.859 align:start position:0%
the person who's been accused of
 
02:55:51.830 --> 02:55:51.840 align:start position:0%
uh because at one point you talk a bit
 
02:55:53.630 --> 02:55:53.640 align:start position:0%
victim in another defendant so I'm just
 
02:55:55.070 --> 02:55:55.080 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out
 
02:55:57.349 --> 02:55:57.359 align:start position:0%
whose rights these are yep so I'm not
 
02:55:59.030 --> 02:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
changing definition of victim so the
 
02:56:01.429 --> 02:56:01.439 align:start position:0%
victim is not the accused the victim is
 
02:56:05.389 --> 02:56:05.399 align:start position:0%
what we would consider a victim so
 
02:56:07.250 --> 02:56:07.260 align:start position:0%
um in a theft case the person whose
 
02:56:09.590 --> 02:56:09.600 align:start position:0%
money was stolen in a assault case the
 
02:56:11.570 --> 02:56:11.580 align:start position:0%
person who is battered um so I'm not
 
02:56:13.010 --> 02:56:13.020 align:start position:0%
actually changing the definition of
 
02:56:13.020 --> 02:56:14.150 align:start position:0%
actually changing the definition of
victim

02:56:14.150 --> 02:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
victim
 
02:56:15.830 --> 02:56:15.840 align:start position:0%
um where it might have been confusing is
 
02:56:18.170 --> 02:56:18.180 align:start position:0%
that line 11 where I did have a typo so
 
02:56:20.030 --> 02:56:20.040 align:start position:0%
that's pretty much where it would and
 
02:56:23.389 --> 02:56:23.399 align:start position:0%
it's not adding any rights to defendants
 
02:56:25.849 --> 02:56:25.859 align:start position:0%
um so it I I hope that answers your
 
02:56:25.859 --> 02:56:26.630 align:start position:0%
um so it I I hope that answers your
question

02:56:26.630 --> 02:56:26.640 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:56:30.469 --> 02:56:30.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:42.170 --> 02:56:42.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:44.929 --> 02:56:44.939 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes uh
 
02:57:03.050 --> 02:57:03.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:04.790 --> 02:57:04.800 align:start position:0%
I wasn't sure if it was supposed to be
 
02:57:06.349 --> 02:57:06.359 align:start position:0%
red or white
 
02:57:09.349 --> 02:57:09.359 align:start position:0%
red thank you good afternoon uh chairman
 
02:57:10.429 --> 02:57:10.439 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
02:57:11.929 --> 02:57:11.939 align:start position:0%
Stephen Andrews I'm a prosecutor at the
 
02:57:14.210 --> 02:57:14.220 align:start position:0%
Merrimack County Attorney's Office I've
 
02:57:15.950 --> 02:57:15.960 align:start position:0%
been a prosecutor for a little over 20
 
02:57:15.960 --> 02:57:18.050 align:start position:0%
been a prosecutor for a little over 20
years

02:57:18.050 --> 02:57:18.060 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:57:20.150 --> 02:57:20.160 align:start position:0%
I oppose this bill and asked to be found
 
02:57:22.910 --> 02:57:22.920 align:start position:0%
in expedient to legislate
 
02:57:22.920 --> 02:57:23.809 align:start position:0%
in expedient to legislate
um

02:57:23.809 --> 02:57:23.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:57:27.590 --> 02:57:27.600 align:start position:0%
the the first thing to me is part two
 
02:57:29.210 --> 02:57:29.220 align:start position:0%
article 88 of the New Hampshire
 
02:57:31.730 --> 02:57:31.740 align:start position:0%
Constitution requires all indictments
 
02:57:33.830 --> 02:57:33.840 align:start position:0%
and complaints in New Hampshire to
 
02:57:35.510 --> 02:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
conclude with the language against the
 
02:57:37.969 --> 02:57:37.979 align:start position:0%
peace and dignity of this state
 
02:57:39.530 --> 02:57:39.540 align:start position:0%
and I think those are More Than Just
 
02:57:43.370 --> 02:57:43.380 align:start position:0%
Words it's a recognition that crime is
 
02:57:45.710 --> 02:57:45.720 align:start position:0%
committed against Society
 
02:57:48.290 --> 02:57:48.300 align:start position:0%
there may be individual victims
 
02:57:50.750 --> 02:57:50.760 align:start position:0%
but crime in New Hampshire is against
 
02:57:54.170 --> 02:57:54.180 align:start position:0%
the peace and dignity of the state
 
02:57:57.650 --> 02:57:57.660 align:start position:0%
I emailed the committee yesterday the
 
02:57:59.750 --> 02:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
National District Attorneys Association
 
02:58:01.550 --> 02:58:01.560 align:start position:0%
best practices guide for domestic
 
02:58:03.290 --> 02:58:03.300 align:start position:0%
violence prosecution
 
02:58:05.809 --> 02:58:05.819 align:start position:0%
and I handed out a letter from attorney
 
02:58:07.490 --> 02:58:07.500 align:start position:0%
Halverson the Merrimack County attorney
 
02:58:09.710 --> 02:58:09.720 align:start position:0%
who included the Attorney General's
 
02:58:11.570 --> 02:58:11.580 align:start position:0%
model protocols for domestic violence
 
02:58:11.580 --> 02:58:12.830 align:start position:0%
model protocols for domestic violence
prosecution

02:58:12.830 --> 02:58:12.840 align:start position:0%
prosecution
 
02:58:14.929 --> 02:58:14.939 align:start position:0%
and the reason I did that is because
 
02:58:17.330 --> 02:58:17.340 align:start position:0%
domestic violence is a fairly fairly
 
02:58:19.849 --> 02:58:19.859 align:start position:0%
complex subject and it's unlike many
 
02:58:21.889 --> 02:58:21.899 align:start position:0%
other crimes
 
02:58:21.899 --> 02:58:22.490 align:start position:0%
other crimes
um

02:58:22.490 --> 02:58:22.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:58:24.889 --> 02:58:24.899 align:start position:0%
when you look at the ndaa best practices
 
02:58:26.870 --> 02:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
guide it indicates that 80 percent of
 
02:58:28.670 --> 02:58:28.680 align:start position:0%
victims recant
 
02:58:30.650 --> 02:58:30.660 align:start position:0%
so 80 percent of domestic violence
 
02:58:30.660 --> 02:58:32.210 align:start position:0%
so 80 percent of domestic violence
victims

02:58:32.210 --> 02:58:32.220 align:start position:0%
victims
 
02:58:33.889 --> 02:58:33.899 align:start position:0%
um don't want to cooperate with
 
02:58:33.899 --> 02:58:35.269 align:start position:0%
um don't want to cooperate with
prosecution

02:58:35.269 --> 02:58:35.279 align:start position:0%
prosecution
 
02:58:37.969 --> 02:58:37.979 align:start position:0%
if victims had the ability to Simply
 
02:58:40.630 --> 02:58:40.640 align:start position:0%
drop charges you'd end up in a scenario
 
02:58:43.370 --> 02:58:43.380 align:start position:0%
where 80 percent of domestic violence
 
02:58:44.630 --> 02:58:44.640 align:start position:0%
cases in New Hampshire would be
 
02:58:47.090 --> 02:58:47.100 align:start position:0%
dismissed at the victim's request
 
02:58:47.100 --> 02:58:48.469 align:start position:0%
dismissed at the victim's request
uh

02:58:48.469 --> 02:58:48.479 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:58:50.750 --> 02:58:50.760 align:start position:0%
obviously the state has interests in
 
02:58:52.849 --> 02:58:52.859 align:start position:0%
pursuing domestic violence that may
 
02:58:56.030 --> 02:58:56.040 align:start position:0%
differ from the victim's interests
 
02:58:58.969 --> 02:58:58.979 align:start position:0%
I I heard the sponsor indicate
 
02:59:00.889 --> 02:59:00.899 align:start position:0%
something about shoplifting that
 
02:59:02.570 --> 02:59:02.580 align:start position:0%
essentially an accordion satisfaction
 
02:59:04.790 --> 02:59:04.800 align:start position:0%
with shoplifting where if the merchant
 
02:59:06.050 --> 02:59:06.060 align:start position:0%
feels whole they don't have to go
 
02:59:08.269 --> 02:59:08.279 align:start position:0%
forward with the case I would note that
 
02:59:11.809 --> 02:59:11.819 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire there's RSA 544c1 which
 
02:59:14.690 --> 02:59:14.700 align:start position:0%
is essentially already allows merchants
 
02:59:16.910 --> 02:59:16.920 align:start position:0%
in shoplifting cases to seek a civil
 
02:59:19.670 --> 02:59:19.680 align:start position:0%
forfeiture of 400 dollars instead of
 
02:59:21.290 --> 02:59:21.300 align:start position:0%
pursuing a criminal prosecution against
 
02:59:23.030 --> 02:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
an individual
 
02:59:24.769 --> 02:59:24.779 align:start position:0%
so to the extent there's an accordion
 
02:59:27.530 --> 02:59:27.540 align:start position:0%
satisfaction with reference to theft
 
02:59:29.990 --> 02:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
that that essentially already exists in
 
02:59:31.429 --> 02:59:31.439 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
02:59:33.410 --> 02:59:33.420 align:start position:0%
I think that this bill
 
02:59:35.630 --> 02:59:35.640 align:start position:0%
unfortunately sets the stage for victim
 
02:59:39.050 --> 02:59:39.060 align:start position:0%
in intimidation for witness intimidation
 
02:59:40.730 --> 02:59:40.740 align:start position:0%
because certainly if victims had the
 
02:59:43.010 --> 02:59:43.020 align:start position:0%
right to to drop charges people that
 
02:59:45.530 --> 02:59:45.540 align:start position:0%
were charged would perhaps want victims
 
02:59:47.750 --> 02:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
to drop those charges and that doesn't
 
02:59:49.790 --> 02:59:49.800 align:start position:0%
just relate to domestic violence that
 
02:59:52.630 --> 02:59:52.640 align:start position:0%
would relate to gangs or any Community
 
02:59:55.670 --> 02:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
any Community crime
 
02:59:58.190 --> 02:59:58.200 align:start position:0%
attorney Halverson had reached out to
 
02:59:59.990 --> 03:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
the other County attorneys regarding
 
03:00:02.809 --> 03:00:02.819 align:start position:0%
this bill and I can indicate that in
 
03:00:04.309 --> 03:00:04.319 align:start position:0%
addition to Merrimack County attorney
 
03:00:06.710 --> 03:00:06.720 align:start position:0%
Halverson opposing it Cheshire county
 
03:00:09.170 --> 03:00:09.180 align:start position:0%
attorney Chris McLaughlin opposes it
 
03:00:10.969 --> 03:00:10.979 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County attorney Patricia
 
03:00:13.309 --> 03:00:13.319 align:start position:0%
Conway opposes it Carroll County
 
03:00:16.190 --> 03:00:16.200 align:start position:0%
attorney Michaela Andrews opposes it
 
03:00:18.170 --> 03:00:18.180 align:start position:0%
co-as County Attorney John McCormick
 
03:00:20.210 --> 03:00:20.220 align:start position:0%
opposes it Belknap County attorney
 
03:00:22.429 --> 03:00:22.439 align:start position:0%
Andrew Livernois opposes it in Grafton
 
03:00:24.290 --> 03:00:24.300 align:start position:0%
County attorney Marshall Hornick opposes
 
03:00:27.530 --> 03:00:27.540 align:start position:0%
it uh I hadn't heard from anybody
 
03:00:29.210 --> 03:00:29.220 align:start position:0%
involved in the law enforcement or
 
03:00:31.250 --> 03:00:31.260 align:start position:0%
prosecution side of things that they
 
03:00:32.990 --> 03:00:33.000 align:start position:0%
supported this bill and I would ask that
 
03:00:35.510 --> 03:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
you find it inexpedient to legislate as
 
03:00:39.410 --> 03:00:39.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:41.750 --> 03:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
representative new
 
03:00:45.769 --> 03:00:45.779 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman could you
 
03:00:48.769 --> 03:00:48.779 align:start position:0%
I know that there are uh domestic
 
03:00:51.170 --> 03:00:51.180 align:start position:0%
violence is highly correlated with a
 
03:00:52.910 --> 03:00:52.920 align:start position:0%
variety of other
 
03:00:54.290 --> 03:00:54.300 align:start position:0%
um violent crimes
 
03:00:56.150 --> 03:00:56.160 align:start position:0%
um can you speak to that at all I
 
03:00:58.370 --> 03:00:58.380 align:start position:0%
considering the the crime against
 
03:01:00.050 --> 03:01:00.060 align:start position:0%
Society aspect
 
03:01:04.010 --> 03:01:04.020 align:start position:0%
I think that I don't have any statistics
 
03:01:06.230 --> 03:01:06.240 align:start position:0%
of of what domestic violence is
 
03:01:07.550 --> 03:01:07.560 align:start position:0%
correlated with
 
03:01:09.730 --> 03:01:09.740 align:start position:0%
I went to a workshop several years ago
 
03:01:12.170 --> 03:01:12.180 align:start position:0%
where a police officer was talking about
 
03:01:13.910 --> 03:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
domestic violence and he said what
 
03:01:15.410 --> 03:01:15.420 align:start position:0%
essentially this is is murder
 
03:01:15.420 --> 03:01:16.790 align:start position:0%
essentially this is is murder
intervention

03:01:16.790 --> 03:01:16.800 align:start position:0%
intervention
 
03:01:19.790 --> 03:01:19.800 align:start position:0%
and that really struck me that
 
03:01:22.130 --> 03:01:22.140 align:start position:0%
this is a crime that can essentially
 
03:01:25.130 --> 03:01:25.140 align:start position:0%
lead to this person being killed
 
03:01:30.170 --> 03:01:30.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:35.690 --> 03:01:35.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:40.309 --> 03:01:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:40.319 --> 03:01:51.290 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:01:51.290 --> 03:01:51.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:53.210 --> 03:01:53.220 align:start position:0%

are the umbrella Organization for 12
 
03:02:06.650 --> 03:02:06.660 align:start position:0%
community-based crisis centers
 
03:02:08.030 --> 03:02:08.040 align:start position:0%
throughout New Hampshire that provide
 
03:02:10.370 --> 03:02:10.380 align:start position:0%
free and confidential services to
 
03:02:12.590 --> 03:02:12.600 align:start position:0%
approximately fifteen thousand victims
 
03:02:15.050 --> 03:02:15.060 align:start position:0%
of crime every year victims of sexual
 
03:02:17.690 --> 03:02:17.700 align:start position:0%
assault domestic violence stalking and
 
03:02:19.790 --> 03:02:19.800 align:start position:0%
human trafficking I too am here to
 
03:02:21.349 --> 03:02:21.359 align:start position:0%
provide testimony in opposition to House
 
03:02:24.769 --> 03:02:24.779 align:start position:0%
Bill 545 which provides harmful changes
 
03:02:26.330 --> 03:02:26.340 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire's crime victim Bill of
 
03:02:26.340 --> 03:02:27.650 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire's crime victim Bill of
Rights

03:02:27.650 --> 03:02:27.660 align:start position:0%
Rights
 
03:02:30.170 --> 03:02:30.180 align:start position:0%
on its face the bill appears to
 
03:02:32.090 --> 03:02:32.100 align:start position:0%
strengthen the victim Bill of Rights but
 
03:02:34.250 --> 03:02:34.260 align:start position:0%
in fact it does the exact opposite and
 
03:02:36.889 --> 03:02:36.899 align:start position:0%
truly it takes us back decades the
 
03:02:38.570 --> 03:02:38.580 align:start position:0%
criminal legal system is one that is
 
03:02:40.670 --> 03:02:40.680 align:start position:0%
foreign and often intimidating to
 
03:02:40.680 --> 03:02:41.630 align:start position:0%
foreign and often intimidating to
victims

03:02:41.630 --> 03:02:41.640 align:start position:0%
victims
 
03:02:43.969 --> 03:02:43.979 align:start position:0%
historically victims of crime especially
 
03:02:46.010 --> 03:02:46.020 align:start position:0%
victims of domestic violence and sexual
 
03:02:48.050 --> 03:02:48.060 align:start position:0%
assault were not treated well within
 
03:02:50.510 --> 03:02:50.520 align:start position:0%
this system the courtroom was often
 
03:02:52.370 --> 03:02:52.380 align:start position:0%
another place where a victim was
 
03:02:54.349 --> 03:02:54.359 align:start position:0%
silenced and an offender was able to
 
03:02:56.210 --> 03:02:56.220 align:start position:0%
continue to victimize the person that
 
03:02:58.370 --> 03:02:58.380 align:start position:0%
they had already hurt
 
03:03:00.650 --> 03:03:00.660 align:start position:0%
as a result of this pattern every state
 
03:03:02.510 --> 03:03:02.520 align:start position:0%
in the country has a crime victim Bill
 
03:03:04.429 --> 03:03:04.439 align:start position:0%
of Rights it may be embedded in their
 
03:03:06.170 --> 03:03:06.180 align:start position:0%
statute it may be embedded in their
 
03:03:08.210 --> 03:03:08.220 align:start position:0%
constitution and in some states it's in
 
03:03:09.230 --> 03:03:09.240 align:start position:0%
both places
 
03:03:11.450 --> 03:03:11.460 align:start position:0%
but the intent of these laws is the same
 
03:03:13.790 --> 03:03:13.800 align:start position:0%
throughout the country the intent is to
 
03:03:15.530 --> 03:03:15.540 align:start position:0%
ensure that victims have meaningful
 
03:03:18.110 --> 03:03:18.120 align:start position:0%
participation in the process what that
 
03:03:19.550 --> 03:03:19.560 align:start position:0%
means is that victims are treated with
 
03:03:21.590 --> 03:03:21.600 align:start position:0%
dignity and respect that they have
 
03:03:23.929 --> 03:03:23.939 align:start position:0%
notice of hearings and they are heard in
 
03:03:25.790 --> 03:03:25.800 align:start position:0%
a meaningful way
 
03:03:27.349 --> 03:03:27.359 align:start position:0%
this bill under the guise of
 
03:03:29.330 --> 03:03:29.340 align:start position:0%
strengthening victims rights does just
 
03:03:31.849 --> 03:03:31.859 align:start position:0%
the opposite in fact it moves several
 
03:03:33.290 --> 03:03:33.300 align:start position:0%
functions of the state as you've already
 
03:03:35.929 --> 03:03:35.939 align:start position:0%
heard from some witnesses back onto the
 
03:03:38.210 --> 03:03:38.220 align:start position:0%
shoulder of victims and in so doing it
 
03:03:40.130 --> 03:03:40.140 align:start position:0%
opens the door for offenders to engage
 
03:03:42.889 --> 03:03:42.899 align:start position:0%
in further intimidation coercion and
 
03:03:42.899 --> 03:03:44.510 align:start position:0%
in further intimidation coercion and
harassment

03:03:44.510 --> 03:03:44.520 align:start position:0%
harassment
 
03:03:46.490 --> 03:03:46.500 align:start position:0%
as you heard earlier victims should
 
03:03:48.410 --> 03:03:48.420 align:start position:0%
never bear the responsibility for the
 
03:03:50.510 --> 03:03:50.520 align:start position:0%
crimes committed against them nor is it
 
03:03:52.250 --> 03:03:52.260 align:start position:0%
the victim's job to hold offenders
 
03:03:54.110 --> 03:03:54.120 align:start position:0%
accountable that is the job of our
 
03:03:56.030 --> 03:03:56.040 align:start position:0%
communities and our states
 
03:03:58.250 --> 03:03:58.260 align:start position:0%
therefore we oppose victims being able
 
03:04:00.469 --> 03:04:00.479 align:start position:0%
to remove bail conditions or to modify
 
03:04:03.110 --> 03:04:03.120 align:start position:0%
restitution that is the job of attorneys
 
03:04:05.630 --> 03:04:05.640 align:start position:0%
and the court and as to the accord and
 
03:04:07.190 --> 03:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
satisfaction piece that has been written
 
03:04:08.630 --> 03:04:08.640 align:start position:0%
into this bill and it was referenced by
 
03:04:10.250 --> 03:04:10.260 align:start position:0%
the sponsor if you look at the
 
03:04:12.050 --> 03:04:12.060 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts language sexual assault
 
03:04:13.730 --> 03:04:13.740 align:start position:0%
and domestic violence are explicitly
 
03:04:15.950 --> 03:04:15.960 align:start position:0%
carved out from that option and as you
 
03:04:17.389 --> 03:04:17.399 align:start position:0%
heard from attorney Andres that's
 
03:04:19.550 --> 03:04:19.560 align:start position:0%
addressed elsewhere in New Hampshire law
 
03:04:21.710 --> 03:04:21.720 align:start position:0%
if these functions are moved into the
 
03:04:23.090 --> 03:04:23.100 align:start position:0%
hands of victims without the court
 
03:04:25.670 --> 03:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
playing a role offenders are being given
 
03:04:27.830 --> 03:04:27.840 align:start position:0%
a free pass to harass victims into
 
03:04:29.929 --> 03:04:29.939 align:start position:0%
relinquishing remedies that have already
 
03:04:32.570 --> 03:04:32.580 align:start position:0%
been ordered to protect them
 
03:04:34.610 --> 03:04:34.620 align:start position:0%
victims who fear the public exposure of
 
03:04:37.190 --> 03:04:37.200 align:start position:0%
a courtroom will be even less likely to
 
03:04:38.389 --> 03:04:38.399 align:start position:0%
seek Justice
 
03:04:40.250 --> 03:04:40.260 align:start position:0%
so in conclusion this bill would reverse
 
03:04:41.929 --> 03:04:41.939 align:start position:0%
the progress we've made over decades
 
03:04:43.490 --> 03:04:43.500 align:start position:0%
across the country to ensure that
 
03:04:45.769 --> 03:04:45.779 align:start position:0%
victims are afforded the protection and
 
03:04:47.809 --> 03:04:47.819 align:start position:0%
the participation that they deserve in a
 
03:04:50.210 --> 03:04:50.220 align:start position:0%
criminal prosecution and if passed this
 
03:04:51.710 --> 03:04:51.720 align:start position:0%
legislation would create an incentive
 
03:04:53.870 --> 03:04:53.880 align:start position:0%
for abusers to further harm the people
 
03:04:55.490 --> 03:04:55.500 align:start position:0%
they have already injured I encourage
 
03:04:56.990 --> 03:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
you to vote itl and I'm happy to take
 
03:04:57.000 --> 03:05:01.010 align:start position:0%
you to vote itl and I'm happy to take
questions

03:05:01.010 --> 03:05:01.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:07.130 --> 03:05:07.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:14.590 --> 03:05:14.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:20.630 --> 03:05:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:22.190 --> 03:05:22.200 align:start position:0%

and I'm here to represent that
 
03:05:37.309 --> 03:05:37.319 align:start position:0%

uh this bill house bill 545.
 
03:05:43.010 --> 03:05:43.020 align:start position:0%
by way of introduction for the record
 
03:05:44.809 --> 03:05:44.819 align:start position:0%
I've been a police officer now for over
 
03:05:46.490 --> 03:05:46.500 align:start position:0%
43 years
 
03:05:48.590 --> 03:05:48.600 align:start position:0%
uh 23 of those years were with the New

Hampshire State Police
 
03:05:52.250 --> 03:05:52.260 align:start position:0%
and 13 of those 23 years were with a
 
03:05:53.870 --> 03:05:53.880 align:start position:0%
major crime unit
 
03:05:56.750 --> 03:05:56.760 align:start position:0%
career-wise I've investigated over 100
 
03:05:56.760 --> 03:05:58.309 align:start position:0%
career-wise I've investigated over 100
homicides

03:05:58.309 --> 03:05:58.319 align:start position:0%
homicides
 
03:06:00.710 --> 03:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
of those 100 plus homicides more than 50
 
03:06:03.349 --> 03:06:03.359 align:start position:0%
percent were domestic violence related
 
03:06:05.030 --> 03:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
I'm the guy that gets to come here and
 
03:06:07.010 --> 03:06:07.020 align:start position:0%
tell you the war stories about what this
 
03:06:07.020 --> 03:06:08.150 align:start position:0%
tell you the war stories about what this
does

03:06:08.150 --> 03:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
does
 
03:06:10.070 --> 03:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
early in my career
 
03:06:12.230 --> 03:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
as a dairy police officer
 
03:06:14.990 --> 03:06:15.000 align:start position:0%
I feel that a call from a victim of
 
03:06:16.730 --> 03:06:16.740 align:start position:0%
domestic violence and I when I say
 
03:06:19.309 --> 03:06:19.319 align:start position:0%
victim I mean victim this woman had been
 
03:06:20.990 --> 03:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
beaten to within an inch of her life by
 
03:06:23.090 --> 03:06:23.100 align:start position:0%
her living boyfriend
 
03:06:25.670 --> 03:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
she'd been thrown down the stairs she'd
 
03:06:27.590 --> 03:06:27.600 align:start position:0%
been beaten with a suitcase and anything
 
03:06:29.450 --> 03:06:29.460 align:start position:0%
else that he could find
 
03:06:31.969 --> 03:06:31.979 align:start position:0%
certainly I took the report investigated
 
03:06:34.070 --> 03:06:34.080 align:start position:0%
it applied for Warren affidavit and
 
03:06:35.990 --> 03:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
complained although it was a felony at
 
03:06:38.750 --> 03:06:38.760 align:start position:0%
the time and arrested the gentleman
 
03:06:41.570 --> 03:06:41.580 align:start position:0%
30 days to the day later she came into
 
03:06:44.150 --> 03:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
the PD and recanted her statement
 
03:06:46.550 --> 03:06:46.560 align:start position:0%
at that particular point in time being a
 
03:06:47.870 --> 03:06:47.880 align:start position:0%
very young officer
 
03:06:50.030 --> 03:06:50.040 align:start position:0%
I asked her if she really meant what she
 
03:06:51.710 --> 03:06:51.720 align:start position:0%
was saying she said oh yeah yeah it was
 
03:06:54.050 --> 03:06:54.060 align:start position:0%
just an accident no problem she said
 
03:06:55.969 --> 03:06:55.979 align:start position:0%
fine and I arrested her for misdemeanor
 
03:06:57.710 --> 03:06:57.720 align:start position:0%
unsworn falsification
 
03:06:59.210 --> 03:06:59.220 align:start position:0%
I'm still paying Penance for that
 
03:07:01.790 --> 03:07:01.800 align:start position:0%
decision 40 plus years later
 
03:07:03.950 --> 03:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
that was wrong on my part
 
03:07:06.050 --> 03:07:06.060 align:start position:0%
and there's no doubt in my mind that her
 
03:07:07.490 --> 03:07:07.500 align:start position:0%
boyfriend her living boyfriend had
 
03:07:08.809 --> 03:07:08.819 align:start position:0%
convinced her
 
03:07:11.570 --> 03:07:11.580 align:start position:0%
to recance your statement I've seen many
 
03:07:15.469 --> 03:07:15.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:18.410 --> 03:07:18.420 align:start position:0%
we agree however with one thing in the
 
03:07:20.150 --> 03:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
bill as presented but we certainly
 
03:07:22.790 --> 03:07:22.800 align:start position:0%
oppose a bill as written and that's the
 
03:07:24.290 --> 03:07:24.300 align:start position:0%
expansion of the class of victims that
 
03:07:26.510 --> 03:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
you'll find in the first paragraph
 
03:07:28.130 --> 03:07:28.140 align:start position:0%
but the rest of the bill raises many
 
03:07:28.140 --> 03:07:29.389 align:start position:0%
but the rest of the bill raises many
questions

03:07:29.389 --> 03:07:29.399 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:07:32.269 --> 03:07:32.279 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to defer it to my
 
03:07:34.370 --> 03:07:34.380 align:start position:0%
colleague and prosecutor Attorney Muller
 
03:07:36.050 --> 03:07:36.060 align:start position:0%
to address some of those
 
03:07:38.090 --> 03:07:38.100 align:start position:0%
as I've so often heard in these
 
03:07:39.650 --> 03:07:39.660 align:start position:0%
committees as well as others over 14
 
03:07:41.630 --> 03:07:41.640 align:start position:0%
years of serving in this particular
 
03:07:43.550 --> 03:07:43.560 align:start position:0%
position this bill is not ready for
 
03:07:46.309 --> 03:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
prime time not the way it's written
 
03:07:48.410 --> 03:07:48.420 align:start position:0%
with that I thank you very much and I'll
 
03:07:51.170 --> 03:07:51.180 align:start position:0%
defer to attorney Mueller
 
03:07:53.510 --> 03:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
my name is Andrea Mueller I'm a
 
03:07:56.269 --> 03:07:56.279 align:start position:0%
prosecutor for the Frank for Franklin
 
03:07:57.710 --> 03:07:57.720 align:start position:0%
um I've been with the Franklin Police
 
03:08:00.410 --> 03:08:00.420 align:start position:0%
Department for almost two years prior to
 
03:08:03.410 --> 03:08:03.420 align:start position:0%
that I was with Manchester for
 
03:08:06.349 --> 03:08:06.359 align:start position:0%
um just about nine years I did work in
 
03:08:09.230 --> 03:08:09.240 align:start position:0%
the domestic violence unit in Manchester
 
03:08:09.240 --> 03:08:11.150 align:start position:0%
the domestic violence unit in Manchester
and

03:08:11.150 --> 03:08:11.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:08:14.809 --> 03:08:14.819 align:start position:0%
um I do oppose the bill for a variety of
 
03:08:17.210 --> 03:08:17.220 align:start position:0%
reasons many of which have been stated
 
03:08:22.010 --> 03:08:22.020 align:start position:0%
by attorney Enders and Miss Chalet but I
 
03:08:25.510 --> 03:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
would just like to address a few things
 
03:08:28.490 --> 03:08:28.500 align:start position:0%
so the victim having the right to remove
 
03:08:31.610 --> 03:08:31.620 align:start position:0%
the no contact order while the case is
 
03:08:34.849 --> 03:08:34.859 align:start position:0%
pending that opens up the door to
 
03:08:38.090 --> 03:08:38.100 align:start position:0%
witness tampering very often I have seen
 
03:08:42.769 --> 03:08:42.779 align:start position:0%
in in practice when a judge after a
 
03:08:45.650 --> 03:08:45.660 align:start position:0%
hearing removes the no contact order and
 
03:08:47.990 --> 03:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
the parties are together soon after
 
03:08:50.750 --> 03:08:50.760 align:start position:0%
either we lose the State loses contact
 
03:08:54.230 --> 03:08:54.240 align:start position:0%
with the victim the victim no longer
 
03:08:58.370 --> 03:08:58.380 align:start position:0%
wants to show up or he or she changes
 
03:09:00.849 --> 03:09:00.859 align:start position:0%
his or her story
 
03:09:06.349 --> 03:09:06.359 align:start position:0%
or minimizes it or recants and that and
 
03:09:09.050 --> 03:09:09.060 align:start position:0%
that is a problem the state is also
 
03:09:11.990 --> 03:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
concerned when the parties have contact
 
03:09:12.000 --> 03:09:13.150 align:start position:0%
concerned when the parties have contact
UM

03:09:13.150 --> 03:09:13.160 align:start position:0%
UM
 
03:09:18.050 --> 03:09:18.060 align:start position:0%
that the cycle of violence
 
03:09:20.210 --> 03:09:20.220 align:start position:0%
um that occurs with these domestic
 
03:09:24.410 --> 03:09:24.420 align:start position:0%
violence cases is still ongoing so you
 
03:09:25.849 --> 03:09:25.859 align:start position:0%
have a pending
 
03:09:29.389 --> 03:09:29.399 align:start position:0%
case and
 
03:09:32.450 --> 03:09:32.460 align:start position:0%
you have
 
03:09:34.849 --> 03:09:34.859 align:start position:0%
a defendant who doesn't want obviously
 
03:09:36.769 --> 03:09:36.779 align:start position:0%
doesn't want to get convicted he's
 
03:09:40.309 --> 03:09:40.319 align:start position:0%
having contact with the victim this does
 
03:09:44.090 --> 03:09:44.100 align:start position:0%
put the victim in in danger
 
03:09:46.490 --> 03:09:46.500 align:start position:0%
um in terms of the Mr the victim having
 
03:09:49.550 --> 03:09:49.560 align:start position:0%
a right in misdemeanor cases to to drop
 
03:09:51.830 --> 03:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
the charges I see a few problems with
 
03:09:51.840 --> 03:09:52.809 align:start position:0%
the charges I see a few problems with
this

03:09:52.809 --> 03:09:52.819 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:09:56.030 --> 03:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
as attorney unders stated this is the
 
03:09:59.870 --> 03:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
state versus the defendant it is the
 
03:10:03.170 --> 03:10:03.180 align:start position:0%
state's case the prosecutor is the one
 
03:10:06.230 --> 03:10:06.240 align:start position:0%
who is making the decisions in the case
 
03:10:09.769 --> 03:10:09.779 align:start position:0%
yes the victim does have input and needs
 
03:10:11.929 --> 03:10:11.939 align:start position:0%
to be consulted per the victim's Bill of
 
03:10:16.010 --> 03:10:16.020 align:start position:0%
Rights but it is ultimately up to the
 
03:10:19.969 --> 03:10:19.979 align:start position:0%
prosecutor about what the direction the
 
03:10:22.130 --> 03:10:22.140 align:start position:0%
case is going to go in I'm also
 
03:10:25.550 --> 03:10:25.560 align:start position:0%
concerned that if the victim has the
 
03:10:27.410 --> 03:10:27.420 align:start position:0%
right to drop charges such as in
 
03:10:30.769 --> 03:10:30.779 align:start position:0%
domestic violence cases if I or other
 
03:10:32.450 --> 03:10:32.460 align:start position:0%
prosecutors have a case where we can
 
03:10:36.110 --> 03:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
prove our case without the victim the
 
03:10:38.450 --> 03:10:38.460 align:start position:0%
state should be able to the state does
 
03:10:41.590 --> 03:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
have a greater interest in protecting
 
03:10:45.290 --> 03:10:45.300 align:start position:0%
Society at large so someone who is
 
03:10:48.889 --> 03:10:48.899 align:start position:0%
violent someone who is assaultive and is
 
03:10:51.969 --> 03:10:51.979 align:start position:0%
threatening people while
 
03:10:54.590 --> 03:10:54.600 align:start position:0%
those the victim and the defendant May
 
03:10:57.110 --> 03:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
ultimately go their separate ways there
 
03:11:00.530 --> 03:11:00.540 align:start position:0%
is still that interest of protecting all
 
03:11:02.889 --> 03:11:02.899 align:start position:0%
of society from the defendant's
 
03:11:05.750 --> 03:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
behaviors and I can say as a domestic
 
03:11:07.750 --> 03:11:07.760 align:start position:0%
violence prosecutor I have seen
 
03:11:10.730 --> 03:11:10.740 align:start position:0%
defendants come in with victim a and
 
03:11:13.730 --> 03:11:13.740 align:start position:0%
then two years later they're back in
 
03:11:17.450 --> 03:11:17.460 align:start position:0%
court with with victim B so this doesn't
 
03:11:19.510 --> 03:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
stop after
 
03:11:21.469 --> 03:11:21.479 align:start position:0%
one case
 
03:11:21.479 --> 03:11:24.469 align:start position:0%
one case
ends

03:11:24.469 --> 03:11:24.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:24.479 --> 03:11:30.410 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:11:30.410 --> 03:11:30.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:33.110 --> 03:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
I'm also concerned about
 
03:11:33.120 --> 03:11:34.370 align:start position:0%
I'm also concerned about
um

03:11:34.370 --> 03:11:34.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:11:36.170 --> 03:11:36.180 align:start position:0%
what this would do to the Court's
 
03:11:39.349 --> 03:11:39.359 align:start position:0%
authority to issue orders for example if
 
03:11:41.690 --> 03:11:41.700 align:start position:0%
someone is charged with violating a
 
03:11:46.969 --> 03:11:46.979 align:start position:0%
protective order and the victim decides
 
03:11:48.830 --> 03:11:48.840 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to go forward with these
 
03:11:51.469 --> 03:11:51.479 align:start position:0%
charges then
 
03:11:53.389 --> 03:11:53.399 align:start position:0%
essentially what is the point of having
 
03:11:55.670 --> 03:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
the court issue orders if it's the
 
03:11:58.550 --> 03:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
victim's call that they can then just
 
03:12:00.710 --> 03:12:00.720 align:start position:0%
drop the charges
 
03:12:04.250 --> 03:12:04.260 align:start position:0%
um and I I believe everything has has uh
 
03:12:05.990 --> 03:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
already been covered that I had wanted
 
03:12:08.030 --> 03:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
to say thank you
 
03:12:10.730 --> 03:12:10.740 align:start position:0%
we'll certainly take any questions thank
 
03:12:12.590 --> 03:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
you um I I have a question so under
 
03:12:15.110 --> 03:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
current law the current situation if a
 
03:12:16.849 --> 03:12:16.859 align:start position:0%
victim wanted to do any of these things
 
03:12:19.370 --> 03:12:19.380 align:start position:0%
uh they're free to do that right now to
 
03:12:22.309 --> 03:12:22.319 align:start position:0%
ask the judge to do these things I mean
 
03:12:26.150 --> 03:12:26.160 align:start position:0%
it's not like they can't correct
 
03:12:28.969 --> 03:12:28.979 align:start position:0%
my experience what happens is if should
 
03:12:30.530 --> 03:12:30.540 align:start position:0%
the victim
 
03:12:32.330 --> 03:12:32.340 align:start position:0%
file motion with the court usually
 
03:12:33.769 --> 03:12:33.779 align:start position:0%
that's kicked back from the court
 
03:12:36.349 --> 03:12:36.359 align:start position:0%
stating that they are not a party to the
 
03:12:38.269 --> 03:12:38.279 align:start position:0%
case and it has to come from one of the
 
03:12:42.349 --> 03:12:42.359 align:start position:0%
attorneys usually defense counsel will
 
03:12:44.990 --> 03:12:45.000 align:start position:0%
file a motion to get those bail
 
03:12:48.650 --> 03:12:48.660 align:start position:0%
conditions amended and the court will
 
03:12:50.690 --> 03:12:50.700 align:start position:0%
schedule a hearing in my experience
 
03:12:52.550 --> 03:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
those hearings have been scheduled
 
03:12:55.550 --> 03:12:55.560 align:start position:0%
fairly frequently such as if someone
 
03:12:58.490 --> 03:12:58.500 align:start position:0%
were to file a motion to amend bail
 
03:13:03.410 --> 03:13:03.420 align:start position:0%
conditions today Friday January 27th it
 
03:13:05.990 --> 03:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
would most likely get heard and put on
 
03:13:09.170 --> 03:13:09.180 align:start position:0%
the Court's docket as an add-in sometime
 
03:13:11.210 --> 03:13:11.220 align:start position:0%
next week
 
03:13:13.730 --> 03:13:13.740 align:start position:0%
and I I guess I'm trying to get at is
 
03:13:16.730 --> 03:13:16.740 align:start position:0%
they do have a voice in an input in the
 
03:13:19.130 --> 03:13:19.140 align:start position:0%
case if they if they decide you know I
 
03:13:20.750 --> 03:13:20.760 align:start position:0%
just don't want to pursue this anymore
 
03:13:24.889 --> 03:13:24.899 align:start position:0%
their voice is heard yes we will
 
03:13:28.010 --> 03:13:28.020 align:start position:0%
um consult with them and
 
03:13:28.020 --> 03:13:28.969 align:start position:0%
um consult with them and
um

03:13:28.969 --> 03:13:28.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:13:31.730 --> 03:13:31.740 align:start position:0%
they are notified of any potential plea
 
03:13:31.740 --> 03:13:33.050 align:start position:0%
they are notified of any potential plea
bargain

03:13:33.050 --> 03:13:33.060 align:start position:0%
bargain
 
03:13:35.030 --> 03:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
that we would offer representative
 
03:13:35.040 --> 03:13:36.469 align:start position:0%
that we would offer representative

03:14:11.230 --> 03:14:11.240 align:start position:0%

03:14:38.389 --> 03:14:38.399 align:start position:0%
um just very quickly in in on the page
 
03:14:40.550 --> 03:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
one starting in line nine it says a
 
03:14:42.050 --> 03:14:42.060 align:start position:0%
victim has the right to remove a
 
03:14:43.910 --> 03:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
non-contact order between them and the
 
03:14:45.710 --> 03:14:45.720 align:start position:0%
accused as a bail condition there's no
 
03:14:48.230 --> 03:14:48.240 align:start position:0%
judicial oversight there's no provision
 
03:14:50.349 --> 03:14:50.359 align:start position:0%
in which the court even knows about this
 
03:14:52.670 --> 03:14:52.680 align:start position:0%
occurring if you have any subsequent
 
03:14:55.130 --> 03:14:55.140 align:start position:0%
enforcement in that bail order
 
03:14:57.889 --> 03:14:57.899 align:start position:0%
this is an undocumented change to the
 
03:15:00.170 --> 03:15:00.180 align:start position:0%
bail order you have it anytime there is
 
03:15:03.530 --> 03:15:03.540 align:start position:0%
a subsequent uh attempt to enforce you
 
03:15:05.809 --> 03:15:05.819 align:start position:0%
have a significant risk of the potential
 
03:15:08.030 --> 03:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
for the power and control that may
 
03:15:10.130 --> 03:15:10.140 align:start position:0%
already exist to be exercised against a
 
03:15:12.230 --> 03:15:12.240 align:start position:0%
victim in order to avoid some subsequent
 
03:15:15.410 --> 03:15:15.420 align:start position:0%
enforcement of uh of a court order and
 
03:15:16.910 --> 03:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
these are again all happening without
 
03:15:18.889 --> 03:15:18.899 align:start position:0%
any oversight within without involvement
 
03:15:20.809 --> 03:15:20.819 align:start position:0%
of the court or documentation through
 
03:15:22.910 --> 03:15:22.920 align:start position:0%
the court they should be done in the
 
03:15:25.070 --> 03:15:25.080 align:start position:0%
process that is already allowed for
 
03:15:26.929 --> 03:15:26.939 align:start position:0%
which is through the parties to either
 
03:15:31.130 --> 03:15:31.140 align:start position:0%
prosecutor or uh or a defendant and
 
03:15:32.809 --> 03:15:32.819 align:start position:0%
again the next sentence a victim has a
 
03:15:34.670 --> 03:15:34.680 align:start position:0%
right to a misdemeanor case to have a
 
03:15:36.769 --> 03:15:36.779 align:start position:0%
charge against them dismissed I think
 
03:15:38.090 --> 03:15:38.100 align:start position:0%
that means against the defendant
 
03:15:40.610 --> 03:15:40.620 align:start position:0%
dismissed not against the victim uh due
 
03:15:42.650 --> 03:15:42.660 align:start position:0%
to a court and satisfaction we agree
 
03:15:45.410 --> 03:15:45.420 align:start position:0%
with the comments you've already heard
 
03:15:49.309 --> 03:15:49.319 align:start position:0%
um in in essence what is happening here
 
03:15:51.830 --> 03:15:51.840 align:start position:0%
is a disrespect of the court system a
 
03:15:53.690 --> 03:15:53.700 align:start position:0%
disrespective court orders and
 
03:15:56.030 --> 03:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
disrespect for the order of law on and
 
03:15:59.150 --> 03:15:59.160 align:start position:0%
allows a defendant who already has power
 
03:16:01.670 --> 03:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
and control over over a victim to
 
03:16:04.670 --> 03:16:04.680 align:start position:0%
further exercise that without any
 
03:16:06.469 --> 03:16:06.479 align:start position:0%
judicial oversight without any
 
03:16:09.230 --> 03:16:09.240 align:start position:0%
involvement of the prosecutor we
 
03:16:11.450 --> 03:16:11.460 align:start position:0%
strongly object and with that I'll
 
03:16:13.130 --> 03:16:13.140 align:start position:0%
conclude my comments and be happy to
 
03:16:17.450 --> 03:16:17.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:28.450 --> 03:16:28.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:31.809 --> 03:16:31.819 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes attorney Jeff
 
03:16:35.030 --> 03:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
stralzin please correct me
 
03:16:37.550 --> 03:16:37.560 align:start position:0%
not an easy one
 
03:16:39.469 --> 03:16:39.479 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is Jeff stralzen
 
03:16:40.790 --> 03:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
I'm an associate attorney general at the
 
03:16:41.809 --> 03:16:41.819 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Attorney General's office
 
03:16:43.849 --> 03:16:43.859 align:start position:0%
for RVC the criminal Bureau and
 
03:16:46.670 --> 03:16:46.680 align:start position:0%
prosecutor almost 30 years in the last
 
03:16:49.490 --> 03:16:49.500 align:start position:0%
22 plus Prosecuting murder cases at the
 
03:16:50.510 --> 03:16:50.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Attorney General's office
 
03:16:52.190 --> 03:16:52.200 align:start position:0%
where I can answer one of the questions
 
03:16:53.690 --> 03:16:53.700 align:start position:0%
that was asked about a correlation
 
03:16:55.610 --> 03:16:55.620 align:start position:0%
between DV and other crimes have you
 
03:16:58.190 --> 03:16:58.200 align:start position:0%
heard from the chief our numbers go back
 
03:16:59.990 --> 03:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
a little over 40 years and I believe
 
03:17:02.630 --> 03:17:02.640 align:start position:0%
it's around 45 to 50 percent of all of
 
03:17:04.370 --> 03:17:04.380 align:start position:0%
our murder cases our domestic violence
 
03:17:04.380 --> 03:17:05.269 align:start position:0%
our murder cases our domestic violence
related

03:17:05.269 --> 03:17:05.279 align:start position:0%
related
 
03:17:07.130 --> 03:17:07.140 align:start position:0%
some years it's a lot more some years
 
03:17:09.410 --> 03:17:09.420 align:start position:0%
it's less but that historical average is
 
03:17:11.389 --> 03:17:11.399 align:start position:0%
around 45 to 50 percent so it's
 
03:17:13.610 --> 03:17:13.620 align:start position:0%
significant and that's and that's why
 
03:17:15.889 --> 03:17:15.899 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire laws have a lot of
 
03:17:17.210 --> 03:17:17.220 align:start position:0%
different Provisions that apply to
 
03:17:19.010 --> 03:17:19.020 align:start position:0%
domestic violence and it's why we oppose
 
03:17:21.469 --> 03:17:21.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:23.570 --> 03:17:23.580 align:start position:0%
victims are emotionally involved in
 
03:17:25.190 --> 03:17:25.200 align:start position:0%
their cases and as you heard sometimes
 
03:17:28.130 --> 03:17:28.140 align:start position:0%
their allegiances can change it's always
 
03:17:29.870 --> 03:17:29.880 align:start position:0%
good to have an objective person making
 
03:17:31.849 --> 03:17:31.859 align:start position:0%
decisions about not only their safety
 
03:17:34.130 --> 03:17:34.140 align:start position:0%
but their family's safety including
 
03:17:37.130 --> 03:17:37.140 align:start position:0%
their children and that's why we oppose
 
03:17:38.750 --> 03:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
this idea that a victim would be able to
 
03:17:41.090 --> 03:17:41.100 align:start position:0%
unilaterally remove this no contact
 
03:17:43.429 --> 03:17:43.439 align:start position:0%
provision that provision was put in
 
03:17:46.130 --> 03:17:46.140 align:start position:0%
place after the court heard from both
 
03:17:48.170 --> 03:17:48.180 align:start position:0%
lawyers and heard all the information
 
03:17:50.809 --> 03:17:50.819 align:start position:0%
and made an informed decision
 
03:17:51.830 --> 03:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
um you know we've I think we've all
 
03:17:53.150 --> 03:17:53.160 align:start position:0%
heard the expression that if somebody
 
03:17:55.190 --> 03:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
who represents himself has a full for a
 
03:17:58.010 --> 03:17:58.020 align:start position:0%
lawyer the point is that sometimes it's
 
03:18:01.490 --> 03:18:01.500 align:start position:0%
important to be objective and so here
 
03:18:03.469 --> 03:18:03.479 align:start position:0%
the objectivity is guaranteed by the
 
03:18:05.269 --> 03:18:05.279 align:start position:0%
fact that you have the court you have
 
03:18:06.650 --> 03:18:06.660 align:start position:0%
prosecutors and you have defense
 
03:18:09.170 --> 03:18:09.180 align:start position:0%
attorneys and so we believe we shouldn't
 
03:18:12.230 --> 03:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
upend that system by allowing people who
 
03:18:14.330 --> 03:18:14.340 align:start position:0%
have not only allegiances to different
 
03:18:16.010 --> 03:18:16.020 align:start position:0%
people but can be pressured by different
 
03:18:18.050 --> 03:18:18.060 align:start position:0%
people to make decisions that not only
 
03:18:20.150 --> 03:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
impact their safety but their family's
 
03:18:22.010 --> 03:18:22.020 align:start position:0%
safety so we're opposed to that portion
 
03:18:23.510 --> 03:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
of a belt
 
03:18:25.610 --> 03:18:25.620 align:start position:0%
we also oppose the piece called
 
03:18:27.469 --> 03:18:27.479 align:start position:0%
according satisfaction
 
03:18:30.530 --> 03:18:30.540 align:start position:0%
and that provision is Limitless and what
 
03:18:32.510 --> 03:18:32.520 align:start position:0%
it means is essentially any defendant
 
03:18:34.610 --> 03:18:34.620 align:start position:0%
who has enough money can make an offer
 
03:18:36.469 --> 03:18:36.479 align:start position:0%
to the victim in their case to
 
03:18:38.269 --> 03:18:38.279 align:start position:0%
essentially pay them off so the charges
 
03:18:40.250 --> 03:18:40.260 align:start position:0%
go away so you're going to create this
 
03:18:43.130 --> 03:18:43.140 align:start position:0%
system where the state is removed from
 
03:18:45.290 --> 03:18:45.300 align:start position:0%
ensuring Justice and instead people who
 
03:18:46.730 --> 03:18:46.740 align:start position:0%
either have the money or can get the
 
03:18:48.410 --> 03:18:48.420 align:start position:0%
money can go to their victim and make
 
03:18:50.510 --> 03:18:50.520 align:start position:0%
them an offer and then the charges have
 
03:18:53.150 --> 03:18:53.160 align:start position:0%
to go away that's not what our system is
 
03:18:55.969 --> 03:18:55.979 align:start position:0%
about I think the goal is Justice for
 
03:18:58.190 --> 03:18:58.200 align:start position:0%
All and of course things aren't always
 
03:18:59.750 --> 03:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
even in society but that's what we're
 
03:19:02.330 --> 03:19:02.340 align:start position:0%
all striving for but injecting this idea
 
03:19:03.950 --> 03:19:03.960 align:start position:0%
into the criminal justice system that
 
03:19:06.769 --> 03:19:06.779 align:start position:0%
you could pay off a victim to get your
 
03:19:09.349 --> 03:19:09.359 align:start position:0%
charges dropped is going to create a
 
03:19:11.450 --> 03:19:11.460 align:start position:0%
second system of justice for the people
 
03:19:13.550 --> 03:19:13.560 align:start position:0%
who are either rich or connected or
 
03:19:16.010 --> 03:19:16.020 align:start position:0%
anything else and then again
 
03:19:18.110 --> 03:19:18.120 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen down the road
 
03:19:19.910 --> 03:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
so this person gets away with that crime
 
03:19:21.769 --> 03:19:21.779 align:start position:0%
because they had enough money Society or
 
03:19:23.330 --> 03:19:23.340 align:start position:0%
potentially other victims are at risk as
 
03:19:24.769 --> 03:19:24.779 align:start position:0%
well because that person has not been
 
03:19:27.290 --> 03:19:27.300 align:start position:0%
held accountable so that's those are the
 
03:19:29.090 --> 03:19:29.100 align:start position:0%
reasons that we oppose this bill again
 
03:19:31.250 --> 03:19:31.260 align:start position:0%
we think the system works very well as
 
03:19:33.290 --> 03:19:33.300 align:start position:0%
it is and we ask you to leave it as is
 
03:19:34.490 --> 03:19:34.500 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to answer any questions
 
03:19:38.809 --> 03:19:38.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:40.610 --> 03:19:40.620 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thanks for
 
03:19:48.730 --> 03:19:48.740 align:start position:0%

03:19:59.690 --> 03:19:59.700 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else wishing to testify
 
03:20:01.010 --> 03:20:01.020 align:start position:0%

um

03:20:11.630 --> 03:20:11.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:15.349 --> 03:20:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:15.359 --> 03:20:18.969 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:20:18.969 --> 03:20:18.979 align:start position:0%

03:20:44.819 --> 03:21:21.190 align:start position:0%
 
perfect

03:21:21.190 --> 03:21:21.200 align:start position:0%

right now
 
03:21:22.859 --> 03:21:26.389 align:start position:0%
right now
so

03:21:26.389 --> 03:21:26.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:26.399 --> 04:01:20.450 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:01:20.450 --> 04:01:20.460 align:start position:0%

um HB 588 was brought to me by a former
inmate

04:02:45.650 --> 04:02:45.660 align:start position:0%
inmate

and
 
04:02:49.429 --> 04:02:49.439 align:start position:0%
after doing a lot of research on it I
 
04:02:51.769 --> 04:02:51.779 align:start position:0%
decided that it's a great bill
 
04:02:53.750 --> 04:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
and it's a bill that I'm looking to pass
 
04:02:56.389 --> 04:02:56.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:59.570 --> 04:02:59.580 align:start position:0%
give you a little background about HP
 
04:02:59.580 --> 04:03:02.150 align:start position:0%
give you a little background about HP
588

04:03:02.150 --> 04:03:02.160 align:start position:0%
588
 
04:03:04.969 --> 04:03:04.979 align:start position:0%
it's a New Hampshire bill that's totally
 
04:03:07.969 --> 04:03:07.979 align:start position:0%
Antiquated and an extreme truth in
 
04:03:10.130 --> 04:03:10.140 align:start position:0%
sentencing policy
 
04:03:13.429 --> 04:03:13.439 align:start position:0%
and it works as a mechanism to undo many
 
04:03:16.610 --> 04:03:16.620 align:start position:0%
years of ineffective expensive and
 
04:03:18.170 --> 04:03:18.180 align:start position:0%
harmful policies
 
04:03:19.910 --> 04:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
that have contributed
 
04:03:22.070 --> 04:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
to mass incarceration
 
04:03:24.830 --> 04:03:24.840 align:start position:0%
and racial disparities in the criminal
 
04:03:30.170 --> 04:03:30.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:34.790 --> 04:03:34.800 align:start position:0%
as called Truth in sentencing
 
04:03:38.150 --> 04:03:38.160 align:start position:0%
it came out of a tough on crime era back
 
04:03:40.130 --> 04:03:40.140 align:start position:0%
in the 1980s
 
04:03:42.469 --> 04:03:42.479 align:start position:0%
and contributed to mass incarcerations
 
04:03:44.210 --> 04:03:44.220 align:start position:0%
as I stated before
 
04:03:48.050 --> 04:03:48.060 align:start position:0%
it's time to reform this harmful policy
 
04:03:50.389 --> 04:03:50.399 align:start position:0%
it's an expensive policy
 
04:03:53.210 --> 04:03:53.220 align:start position:0%
it has resulted in people serving longer
 
04:03:56.330 --> 04:03:56.340 align:start position:0%
sentences at the approximate rate now of
 
04:03:58.490 --> 04:03:58.500 align:start position:0%
sixty thousand dollars a year
 
04:04:00.170 --> 04:04:00.180 align:start position:0%
per person
 
04:04:03.050 --> 04:04:03.060 align:start position:0%
this bill will save money taxpayers
 
04:04:03.060 --> 04:04:04.550 align:start position:0%
this bill will save money taxpayers
money

04:04:04.550 --> 04:04:04.560 align:start position:0%
money
 
04:04:06.769 --> 04:04:06.779 align:start position:0%
this bill does not mean that people will
 
04:04:09.410 --> 04:04:09.420 align:start position:0%
automatically be released from prison
 
04:04:12.170 --> 04:04:12.180 align:start position:0%
after serving 50 of their minimum
 
04:04:12.180 --> 04:04:13.250 align:start position:0%
after serving 50 of their minimum
sentence

04:04:13.250 --> 04:04:13.260 align:start position:0%
sentence
 
04:04:15.650 --> 04:04:15.660 align:start position:0%
it means that they can apply for parole
 
04:04:18.110 --> 04:04:18.120 align:start position:0%
at that time
 
04:04:21.110 --> 04:04:21.120 align:start position:0%
this enables the parole board to do a
 
04:04:22.969 --> 04:04:22.979 align:start position:0%
case by case
 
04:04:22.979 --> 04:04:24.590 align:start position:0%
case by case
analysis

04:04:24.590 --> 04:04:24.600 align:start position:0%
analysis
 
04:04:28.189 --> 04:04:28.199 align:start position:0%
as opposed to truth and sentencing
 
04:04:32.090 --> 04:04:32.100 align:start position:0%
which imposes a blanket policy on all
 
04:04:32.100 --> 04:04:33.410 align:start position:0%
which imposes a blanket policy on all
individuals

04:04:33.410 --> 04:04:33.420 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
04:04:36.410 --> 04:04:36.420 align:start position:0%
regardless of the circumstances of their
 
04:04:43.490 --> 04:04:43.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:46.010 --> 04:04:46.020 align:start position:0%
I did make some changes to
 
04:04:47.870 --> 04:04:47.880 align:start position:0%
um the bill actually were made last term
 
04:04:49.969 --> 04:04:49.979 align:start position:0%
but some kind of way
 
04:04:52.790 --> 04:04:52.800 align:start position:0%
um it never came to us this way it's the
 
04:04:54.769 --> 04:04:54.779 align:start position:0%
original bill that came to us so I did
 
04:04:56.330 --> 04:04:56.340 align:start position:0%
put through an amendment
 
04:04:59.750 --> 04:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
um it's in your emails
 
04:04:59.760 --> 04:05:00.590 align:start position:0%
um it's in your emails
um

04:05:00.590 --> 04:05:00.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:05:02.630 --> 04:05:02.640 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
04:05:04.969 --> 04:05:04.979 align:start position:0%
upstairs fourth floor is supposed to
 
04:05:08.150 --> 04:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
bring down the the paper copies but if
 
04:05:09.590 --> 04:05:09.600 align:start position:0%
you check your email for the criminal
 
04:05:12.110 --> 04:05:12.120 align:start position:0%
justice committee you will see it
 
04:05:15.710 --> 04:05:15.720 align:start position:0%
on line six of the bill the person was
 
04:05:17.210 --> 04:05:17.220 align:start position:0%
sentenced to a minimum not less than
 
04:05:19.010 --> 04:05:19.020 align:start position:0%
five years
 
04:05:20.809 --> 04:05:20.819 align:start position:0%
um that was changed to seven and a half
 
04:05:24.469 --> 04:05:24.479 align:start position:0%
years last session so we just updated it
 
04:05:27.290 --> 04:05:27.300 align:start position:0%
today and the very last
 
04:05:27.300 --> 04:05:28.010 align:start position:0%
today and the very last
um

04:05:28.010 --> 04:05:28.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:05:31.250 --> 04:05:31.260 align:start position:0%
18 line 18
 
04:05:33.469 --> 04:05:33.479 align:start position:0%
this provision of this actually applied
 
04:05:37.790 --> 04:05:37.800 align:start position:0%
to any person incarcerated on or after
 
04:05:40.670 --> 04:05:40.680 align:start position:0%
the effective date of this act it is not
 
04:05:40.680 --> 04:05:42.349 align:start position:0%
the effective date of this act it is not
retroactive

04:05:42.349 --> 04:05:42.359 align:start position:0%
retroactive
 
04:05:44.689 --> 04:05:44.699 align:start position:0%
we also had changed the date from
 
04:05:48.950 --> 04:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
January to January 1st 2024. that was
 
04:05:51.050 --> 04:05:51.060 align:start position:0%
the new date so
 
04:05:51.060 --> 04:05:52.309 align:start position:0%
the new date so
um

04:05:52.309 --> 04:05:52.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:05:54.110 --> 04:05:54.120 align:start position:0%
there's other people that will be
 
04:05:55.849 --> 04:05:55.859 align:start position:0%
testifying that can give you more
 
04:05:59.150 --> 04:05:59.160 align:start position:0%
details on it but I truly believe that
 
04:06:01.670 --> 04:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
this is a good bill and it's about time
 
04:06:04.550 --> 04:06:04.560 align:start position:0%
we do the right thing in New Hampshire
 
04:06:04.560 --> 04:06:05.210 align:start position:0%
we do the right thing in New Hampshire
um

04:06:05.210 --> 04:06:05.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:06:07.010 --> 04:06:07.020 align:start position:0%
and I also can say I don't have the
 
04:06:09.469 --> 04:06:09.479 align:start position:0%
number and and just for informational
 
04:06:13.550 --> 04:06:13.560 align:start position:0%
purposes myself and others did sit with
 
04:06:15.410 --> 04:06:15.420 align:start position:0%
our commissioner at the time that we
 
04:06:17.870 --> 04:06:17.880 align:start position:0%
decided to do this bill and make quite a
 
04:06:20.090 --> 04:06:20.100 align:start position:0%
few adjustments and as we read through
 
04:06:21.349 --> 04:06:21.359 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
04:06:24.170 --> 04:06:24.180 align:start position:0%
I I think I will take the time and read
 
04:06:24.180 --> 04:06:25.070 align:start position:0%
I I think I will take the time and read
through

04:06:25.070 --> 04:06:25.080 align:start position:0%
through
 
04:06:26.689 --> 04:06:26.699 align:start position:0%
the first one is the person was
 
04:06:28.309 --> 04:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
sentenced to a minimum not less than
 
04:06:29.929 --> 04:06:29.939 align:start position:0%
seven and a half years
 
04:06:32.750 --> 04:06:32.760 align:start position:0%
the person has no major or a-level
 
04:06:34.849 --> 04:06:34.859 align:start position:0%
disciplinary violations
 
04:06:36.769 --> 04:06:36.779 align:start position:0%
the person has not demonstrated a
 
04:06:39.650 --> 04:06:39.660 align:start position:0%
pattern a repeated disciplinary offenses
 
04:06:41.990 --> 04:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
that result in an upgrade and
 
04:06:44.570 --> 04:06:44.580 align:start position:0%
classification level
 
04:06:47.389 --> 04:06:47.399 align:start position:0%
the person has completed all court and
 
04:06:49.070 --> 04:06:49.080 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections required
 
04:06:51.889 --> 04:06:51.899 align:start position:0%
programs and treatment if given
 
04:06:54.410 --> 04:06:54.420 align:start position:0%
the person has demonstrated good
 
04:06:58.250 --> 04:06:58.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:01.550 --> 04:07:01.560 align:start position:0%
paragraph nine shall not apply
 
04:07:01.560 --> 04:07:02.929 align:start position:0%
paragraph nine shall not apply
if

04:07:02.929 --> 04:07:02.939 align:start position:0%
if
 
04:07:05.750 --> 04:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
the person received a sentence that
 
04:07:10.370 --> 04:07:10.380 align:start position:0%
prohibits him or her from being paroled
 
04:07:13.130 --> 04:07:13.140 align:start position:0%
the person was convicted of a sexually
 
04:07:16.990 --> 04:07:17.000 align:start position:0%
violent offense as defined in RSA
 
04:07:19.550 --> 04:07:19.560 align:start position:0%
135-e colon 2
 
04:07:19.560 --> 04:07:21.590 align:start position:0%
135-e colon 2
11.

04:07:21.590 --> 04:07:21.600 align:start position:0%
11.
 
04:07:24.889 --> 04:07:24.899 align:start position:0%
the person was convicted of committing a
 
04:07:28.189 --> 04:07:28.199 align:start position:0%
violent crime as defined in RSA 651
 
04:07:34.090 --> 04:07:34.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:37.790 --> 04:07:37.800 align:start position:0%
also 13 against a person under 18 years
 
04:07:39.110 --> 04:07:39.120 align:start position:0%
of age
 
04:07:41.570 --> 04:07:41.580 align:start position:0%
so that's the basis of this
 
04:07:43.610 --> 04:07:43.620 align:start position:0%
um I'm sure you will hear quite a bit of
 
04:07:43.620 --> 04:07:45.410 align:start position:0%
um I'm sure you will hear quite a bit of
testimony

04:07:45.410 --> 04:07:45.420 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
04:07:47.389 --> 04:07:47.399 align:start position:0%
um but I will say that
 
04:07:49.969 --> 04:07:49.979 align:start position:0%
it's about time taxpayers stop paying
 
04:07:52.729 --> 04:07:52.739 align:start position:0%
for this and there's a few people that
 
04:07:55.189 --> 04:07:55.199 align:start position:0%
probably would be eligible for parole or
 
04:07:56.630 --> 04:07:56.640 align:start position:0%
at least get the opportunity to go
 
04:07:58.610 --> 04:07:58.620 align:start position:0%
before the parole board and if we
 
04:08:00.950 --> 04:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
believe our parole board is a great
 
04:08:02.929 --> 04:08:02.939 align:start position:0%
board I don't believe that they would
 
04:08:06.110 --> 04:08:06.120 align:start position:0%
release anyone that's not ready to be be
 
04:08:06.120 --> 04:08:08.450 align:start position:0%
release anyone that's not ready to be be
released

04:08:08.450 --> 04:08:08.460 align:start position:0%
released
 
04:08:11.450 --> 04:08:11.460 align:start position:0%
thank you representative so just for uh
 
04:08:13.910 --> 04:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
reference to the committee uh what the
 
04:08:15.349 --> 04:08:15.359 align:start position:0%
representative speaking of is last year
 
04:08:17.689 --> 04:08:17.699 align:start position:0%
we heard this bill and there was several
 
04:08:19.910 --> 04:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
amendments that were made that were
 
04:08:22.189 --> 04:08:22.199 align:start position:0%
suggestions and unfortunately when this
 
04:08:25.189 --> 04:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
bill was printed all of those changes
 
04:08:26.809 --> 04:08:26.819 align:start position:0%
were not put in this bill and that's the
 
04:08:28.729 --> 04:08:28.739 align:start position:0%
amendment that she is speaking of and
 
04:08:30.349 --> 04:08:30.359 align:start position:0%
the representative myself went upstairs
 
04:08:30.359 --> 04:08:31.429 align:start position:0%
the representative myself went upstairs
to

04:08:31.429 --> 04:08:31.439 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:08:34.189 --> 04:08:34.199 align:start position:0%
try to expedite that to be in writing so
 
04:08:35.210 --> 04:08:35.220 align:start position:0%
it's in front of us we don't actually
 
04:08:37.670 --> 04:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
have to look at our computers are there
 
04:08:40.729 --> 04:08:40.739 align:start position:0%
any questions for representative Murphy
 
04:08:42.950 --> 04:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I just want to
 
04:08:44.510 --> 04:08:44.520 align:start position:0%
clarify that
 
04:08:46.490 --> 04:08:46.500 align:start position:0%
um line six
 
04:08:49.130 --> 04:08:49.140 align:start position:0%
um a when you read you read seven and a
 
04:08:50.630 --> 04:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
half not five years so was that in the
 
04:08:54.290 --> 04:08:54.300 align:start position:0%
amendment yes thank you
 
04:08:56.090 --> 04:08:56.100 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
04:08:58.370 --> 04:08:58.380 align:start position:0%
representative Newman
 
04:09:00.170 --> 04:09:00.180 align:start position:0%
I might admit search so I just want to
 
04:09:02.570 --> 04:09:02.580 align:start position:0%
clarify in the the last sentence it
 
04:09:04.189 --> 04:09:04.199 align:start position:0%
would be striking the word before is
 
04:09:06.050 --> 04:09:06.060 align:start position:0%
that correct it's so it's not
 
04:09:08.150 --> 04:09:08.160 align:start position:0%
retroactive right
 
04:09:10.010 --> 04:09:10.020 align:start position:0%
um we took care of that last session as
 
04:09:12.229 --> 04:09:12.239 align:start position:0%
well thank you
 
04:09:19.550 --> 04:09:19.560 align:start position:0%

04:09:47.460 --> 04:09:53.210 align:start position:0%
scitec I'm from Salem
okay

04:09:53.210 --> 04:09:53.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:56.990 --> 04:09:57.000 align:start position:0%
okay I'm Donna scitec I'm a former
 
04:09:58.490 --> 04:09:58.500 align:start position:0%
member of this committee a long long
 
04:10:01.010 --> 04:10:01.020 align:start position:0%
time ago uh former speaker of the house
 
04:10:03.530 --> 04:10:03.540 align:start position:0%
and a former member of the parole board
 
04:10:06.290 --> 04:10:06.300 align:start position:0%
so I have a long standing interest in
 
04:10:08.689 --> 04:10:08.699 align:start position:0%
this subject matter I was there at the
 
04:10:10.610 --> 04:10:10.620 align:start position:0%
conception 40 years ago when the
 
04:10:12.710 --> 04:10:12.720 align:start position:0%
legislature adopted truth and sentencing
 
04:10:14.870 --> 04:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
and I've always said I would come off my
 
04:10:17.210 --> 04:10:17.220 align:start position:0%
deathbed to save truth and sentencing
 
04:10:18.610 --> 04:10:18.620 align:start position:0%
this is another
 
04:10:21.410 --> 04:10:21.420 align:start position:0%
modification of Truth and sentencing
 
04:10:23.809 --> 04:10:23.819 align:start position:0%
and I think that
 
04:10:23.819 --> 04:10:25.910 align:start position:0%
and I think that
having

04:10:25.910 --> 04:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
having
 
04:10:28.250 --> 04:10:28.260 align:start position:0%
a state policy where the sentence
 
04:10:30.349 --> 04:10:30.359 align:start position:0%
imposed by the judge is the sentence
 
04:10:32.389 --> 04:10:32.399 align:start position:0%
that's actually served
 
04:10:35.150 --> 04:10:35.160 align:start position:0%
is a good policy I think it has served
 
04:10:37.070 --> 04:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
us well
 
04:10:40.250 --> 04:10:40.260 align:start position:0%
there are it has been said that you know
 
04:10:42.469 --> 04:10:42.479 align:start position:0%
other states have changed there's uh
 
04:10:45.110 --> 04:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
their their policies but New Hampshire
 
04:10:47.150 --> 04:10:47.160 align:start position:0%
is proud to maintain some traditions
 
04:10:48.710 --> 04:10:48.720 align:start position:0%
that are very valuable to us I think
 
04:10:50.210 --> 04:10:50.220 align:start position:0%
truth and sentencing is one of them
 
04:10:52.309 --> 04:10:52.319 align:start position:0%
first in the nation primary is another
 
04:10:52.319 --> 04:10:54.050 align:start position:0%
first in the nation primary is another
one

04:10:54.050 --> 04:10:54.060 align:start position:0%
one
 
04:10:54.060 --> 04:10:54.650 align:start position:0%
one
um

04:10:54.650 --> 04:10:54.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:10:57.769 --> 04:10:57.779 align:start position:0%
no to no income and sales tax these are
 
04:11:00.469 --> 04:11:00.479 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire values and I believe that
 
04:11:01.969 --> 04:11:01.979 align:start position:0%
truth and sentencing should be one of
 
04:11:04.910 --> 04:11:04.920 align:start position:0%
them so I there are four points I want
 
04:11:05.870 --> 04:11:05.880 align:start position:0%
to make
 
04:11:07.790 --> 04:11:07.800 align:start position:0%
about this bill
 
04:11:09.769 --> 04:11:09.779 align:start position:0%
first that this would violate truth and
 
04:11:12.110 --> 04:11:12.120 align:start position:0%
sentencing because
 
04:11:14.210 --> 04:11:14.220 align:start position:0%
the judge would impose a sentence of now
 
04:11:18.650 --> 04:11:18.660 align:start position:0%
seven and a half to a larger number uh
 
04:11:20.929 --> 04:11:20.939 align:start position:0%
sentence but but the the minimum
 
04:11:22.309 --> 04:11:22.319 align:start position:0%
sentence of seven and a half wouldn't
 
04:11:25.610 --> 04:11:25.620 align:start position:0%
mean anything for certain crimes
 
04:11:28.610 --> 04:11:28.620 align:start position:0%
what is the minimum sentence mean
 
04:11:31.729 --> 04:11:31.739 align:start position:0%
if it doesn't reflect the actual time
 
04:11:34.429 --> 04:11:34.439 align:start position:0%
that was imposed by the judge so it
 
04:11:39.290 --> 04:11:39.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:41.630 --> 04:11:41.640 align:start position:0%
I think that the public would have
 
04:11:44.150 --> 04:11:44.160 align:start position:0%
confidence in a system that that what
 
04:11:45.650 --> 04:11:45.660 align:start position:0%
what the judge says and what the judge
 
04:11:47.150 --> 04:11:47.160 align:start position:0%
imposed is that sentence that's actually
 
04:11:47.160 --> 04:11:50.389 align:start position:0%
imposed is that sentence that's actually
served

04:11:50.389 --> 04:11:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:53.150 --> 04:11:53.160 align:start position:0%
the people who would be affected by this
 
04:11:55.189 --> 04:11:55.199 align:start position:0%
would be those convicted of serious
 
04:11:57.469 --> 04:11:57.479 align:start position:0%
crimes because you don't get a
 
04:11:59.630 --> 04:11:59.640 align:start position:0%
sentence of seven and a half
 
04:12:02.090 --> 04:12:02.100 align:start position:0%
or greater years unless it's a really
 
04:12:03.650 --> 04:12:03.660 align:start position:0%
serious crime
 
04:12:06.050 --> 04:12:06.060 align:start position:0%
so we're talking about the most serious
 
04:12:06.060 --> 04:12:07.370 align:start position:0%
so we're talking about the most serious
offenders

04:12:07.370 --> 04:12:07.380 align:start position:0%
offenders
 
04:12:09.410 --> 04:12:09.420 align:start position:0%
the there are exclusions for sex
 
04:12:12.170 --> 04:12:12.180 align:start position:0%
offenders but and there are exclusions
 
04:12:12.180 --> 04:12:13.189 align:start position:0%
offenders but and there are exclusions
for

04:12:13.189 --> 04:12:13.199 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:12:15.950 --> 04:12:15.960 align:start position:0%
crimes committed against somebody who
 
04:12:19.910 --> 04:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
was under 18 but the the people eligible
 
04:12:22.130 --> 04:12:22.140 align:start position:0%
for this would still be those might be
 
04:12:24.070 --> 04:12:24.080 align:start position:0%
convicted of secondary murder
 
04:12:26.809 --> 04:12:26.819 align:start position:0%
manslaughter negligent homicide first
 
04:12:29.630 --> 04:12:29.640 align:start position:0%
degree assault strangling kidnapping
 
04:12:32.929 --> 04:12:32.939 align:start position:0%
human trafficking robbery as long as the
 
04:12:35.630 --> 04:12:35.640 align:start position:0%
victim wasn't under 18.
 
04:12:38.210 --> 04:12:38.220 align:start position:0%
I mean are these the people that you
 
04:12:41.150 --> 04:12:41.160 align:start position:0%
think ought to be considered to have
 
04:12:44.150 --> 04:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
their their parole hearing after they've
 
04:12:46.670 --> 04:12:46.680 align:start position:0%
served only 50 percent
 
04:12:49.070 --> 04:12:49.080 align:start position:0%
uh also it would include a lot of uh
 
04:12:51.830 --> 04:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
Financial crimes I I remember a case
 
04:12:55.070 --> 04:12:55.080 align:start position:0%
where there was a gentleman who who was
 
04:12:58.250 --> 04:12:58.260 align:start position:0%
our own uh Bernie Madoff uh in New
 
04:13:01.010 --> 04:13:01.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire he he so many people lost
 
04:13:03.950 --> 04:13:03.960 align:start position:0%
their their fortunes because he was
 
04:13:06.769 --> 04:13:06.779 align:start position:0%
running a Ponzi scheme and I mean he got
 
04:13:08.210 --> 04:13:08.220 align:start position:0%
a serious sentence and he would be
 
04:13:10.610 --> 04:13:10.620 align:start position:0%
eligible for this and all the victims
 
04:13:13.969 --> 04:13:13.979 align:start position:0%
we would see that the sentence that was
 
04:13:15.889 --> 04:13:15.899 align:start position:0%
imposed wasn't the sentence it was
 
04:13:17.389 --> 04:13:17.399 align:start position:0%
actually served
 
04:13:21.590 --> 04:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
uh the bill would also uh apply to a lot
 
04:13:24.229 --> 04:13:24.239 align:start position:0%
of drug crimes the only drug offenses
 
04:13:25.729 --> 04:13:25.739 align:start position:0%
that get long sentences and the
 
04:13:27.769 --> 04:13:27.779 align:start position:0%
legislature over the years has increased
 
04:13:29.330 --> 04:13:29.340 align:start position:0%
the sentences for drug crimes you can
 
04:13:31.790 --> 04:13:31.800 align:start position:0%
get up to 40 years for some drug crimes
 
04:13:34.910 --> 04:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
and this bill would apply to them so you
 
04:13:37.610 --> 04:13:37.620 align:start position:0%
know drug Enterprise leaders uh it's a
 
04:13:39.469 --> 04:13:39.479 align:start position:0%
sale of drugs with with death resulting
 
04:13:41.809 --> 04:13:41.819 align:start position:0%
it would apply
 
04:13:44.090 --> 04:13:44.100 align:start position:0%
um would would be eligible under the
 
04:13:45.710 --> 04:13:45.720 align:start position:0%
wording of this bill
 
04:13:48.830 --> 04:13:48.840 align:start position:0%
I want to remind you that current law
 
04:13:52.010 --> 04:13:52.020 align:start position:0%
already allows for sentence reductions
 
04:13:54.290 --> 04:13:54.300 align:start position:0%
for all crimes
 
04:13:57.110 --> 04:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
the goal is to if the goal is to
 
04:13:59.030 --> 04:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
recognize that people can change and
 
04:14:01.429 --> 04:14:01.439 align:start position:0%
motivate them to do so there are ample
 
04:14:03.950 --> 04:14:03.960 align:start position:0%
opportunities under current law RSA 650
 
04:14:07.130 --> 04:14:07.140 align:start position:0%
120 allows an inmate to ask the court
 
04:14:08.929 --> 04:14:08.939 align:start position:0%
for a reduction of the minimum after
 
04:14:11.090 --> 04:14:11.100 align:start position:0%
serving two-thirds of their sentence
 
04:14:12.830 --> 04:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
this is for everybody
 
04:14:14.689 --> 04:14:14.699 align:start position:0%
after they serve two-thirds of the
 
04:14:15.950 --> 04:14:15.960 align:start position:0%
sentence they can go back to the
 
04:14:19.070 --> 04:14:19.080 align:start position:0%
sentencing judge who has heard all the
 
04:14:20.809 --> 04:14:20.819 align:start position:0%
testimony who was heard from the victims
 
04:14:22.370 --> 04:14:22.380 align:start position:0%
who's heard from the defense who's heard
 
04:14:23.929 --> 04:14:23.939 align:start position:0%
from the prosecution
 
04:14:27.530 --> 04:14:27.540 align:start position:0%
and they can get a reduction of their
 
04:14:31.010 --> 04:14:31.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:33.710 --> 04:14:33.720 align:start position:0%
It's Not Unusual it doesn't happen in
 
04:14:35.450 --> 04:14:35.460 align:start position:0%
every case because I think every inmate
 
04:14:38.990 --> 04:14:39.000 align:start position:0%
applies for it after the two-thirds but
 
04:14:41.750 --> 04:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
it is granted if somebody has really
 
04:14:44.530 --> 04:14:44.540 align:start position:0%
made a turn their life around
 
04:14:47.809 --> 04:14:47.819 align:start position:0%
the judges will will grant it so that's
 
04:14:50.510 --> 04:14:50.520 align:start position:0%
under current law for all crimes serve
 
04:14:53.030 --> 04:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
two-thirds you go back to the judge tell
 
04:14:55.550 --> 04:14:55.560 align:start position:0%
them hey my situation has changed here's
 
04:14:57.830 --> 04:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
my plan and the judge has the authority
 
04:15:00.370 --> 04:15:00.380 align:start position:0%
to Grant it that's under current law
 
04:15:03.650 --> 04:15:03.660 align:start position:0%
often in Ascent in a sentence
 
04:15:06.650 --> 04:15:06.660 align:start position:0%
particularly in a drug crime the judge
 
04:15:08.929 --> 04:15:08.939 align:start position:0%
will impose a sentence and include in
 
04:15:11.929 --> 04:15:11.939 align:start position:0%
the sentence that you can get a year off
 
04:15:14.090 --> 04:15:14.100 align:start position:0%
or two years off for completing a drug
 
04:15:16.189 --> 04:15:16.199 align:start position:0%
program Behind the Walls that's built
 
04:15:17.570 --> 04:15:17.580 align:start position:0%
into the sentence
 
04:15:20.050 --> 04:15:20.060 align:start position:0%
and that happens
 
04:15:23.510 --> 04:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
fairly regularly I I see that at least
 
04:15:25.309 --> 04:15:25.319 align:start position:0%
when I was on the board
 
04:15:29.570 --> 04:15:29.580 align:start position:0%
and in the other in the other cases uh
 
04:15:33.469 --> 04:15:33.479 align:start position:0%
the the judge has allowed the awarding
 
04:15:36.590 --> 04:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
of earned time credit there are all
 
04:15:38.750 --> 04:15:38.760 align:start position:0%
kinds of programs that are available to
 
04:15:41.689 --> 04:15:41.699 align:start position:0%
inmates and they can get time taken off
 
04:15:43.849 --> 04:15:43.859 align:start position:0%
their sentence by completing their
 
04:15:46.189 --> 04:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
programs they can get up to I believe
 
04:15:48.410 --> 04:15:48.420 align:start position:0%
it's up 20 if they completed every kind
 
04:15:50.090 --> 04:15:50.100 align:start position:0%
of program that was available they can
 
04:15:51.769 --> 04:15:51.779 align:start position:0%
get up to like 21 months off their
 
04:15:54.550 --> 04:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
sentence so this is all available
 
04:15:57.349 --> 04:15:57.359 align:start position:0%
without this bill so somebody who has
 
04:15:59.090 --> 04:15:59.100 align:start position:0%
turned their life around
 
04:16:01.370 --> 04:16:01.380 align:start position:0%
can go back to the judge
 
04:16:04.610 --> 04:16:04.620 align:start position:0%
and say Here's my situation won't you
 
04:16:07.189 --> 04:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
rethink my my sentence
 
04:16:10.130 --> 04:16:10.140 align:start position:0%
uh if you think that penalties right now
 
04:16:13.370 --> 04:16:13.380 align:start position:0%
are too harsh change the the penalties
 
04:16:16.670 --> 04:16:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:19.849 --> 04:16:19.859 align:start position:0%
don't do this back door reduction of of
 
04:16:22.070 --> 04:16:22.080 align:start position:0%
the penalty
 
04:16:22.080 --> 04:16:23.030 align:start position:0%
the penalty
um

04:16:23.030 --> 04:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:16:26.090 --> 04:16:26.100 align:start position:0%
this bill if passed would be the same
 
04:16:28.490 --> 04:16:28.500 align:start position:0%
time it would be the only time that
 
04:16:30.110 --> 04:16:30.120 align:start position:0%
there's a sentence modification without
 
04:16:32.269 --> 04:16:32.279 align:start position:0%
the judge's approval
 
04:16:35.030 --> 04:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
all these others all the other ways you
 
04:16:36.769 --> 04:16:36.779 align:start position:0%
can reduce your sentence are approved by
 
04:16:40.309 --> 04:16:40.319 align:start position:0%
the judge this would not require the uh
 
04:16:44.750 --> 04:16:44.760 align:start position:0%
any uh participation by the judge
 
04:16:46.849 --> 04:16:46.859 align:start position:0%
and the fourth point I wanted to make
 
04:16:48.349 --> 04:16:48.359 align:start position:0%
was uh
 
04:16:50.330 --> 04:16:50.340 align:start position:0%
it should not it should only if you're
 
04:16:53.269 --> 04:16:53.279 align:start position:0%
going to do it don't make it retroactive
 
04:16:55.429 --> 04:16:55.439 align:start position:0%
because at the time the sentence was
 
04:16:57.650 --> 04:16:57.660 align:start position:0%
imposed under current law there were
 
04:16:59.450 --> 04:16:59.460 align:start position:0%
certain expectations on the part of the
 
04:17:02.570 --> 04:17:02.580 align:start position:0%
victim it would maybe part of a plea
 
04:17:05.450 --> 04:17:05.460 align:start position:0%
bargain negotiation you know if you'll
 
04:17:07.670 --> 04:17:07.680 align:start position:0%
plead guilty to a second-degree assault
 
04:17:09.110 --> 04:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
we won't charge you with first degree
 
04:17:09.120 --> 04:17:10.130 align:start position:0%
we won't charge you with first degree
assault

04:17:10.130 --> 04:17:10.140 align:start position:0%
assault
 
04:17:10.140 --> 04:17:11.750 align:start position:0%
assault
so

04:17:11.750 --> 04:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:17:14.570 --> 04:17:14.580 align:start position:0%
this will change that so I'm happy to
 
04:17:15.889 --> 04:17:15.899 align:start position:0%
hear the sponsors say that it would
 
04:17:18.710 --> 04:17:18.720 align:start position:0%
apply prospectively only because you
 
04:17:20.630 --> 04:17:20.640 align:start position:0%
have to look at what this means to
 
04:17:20.640 --> 04:17:21.710 align:start position:0%
have to look at what this means to
victims

04:17:21.710 --> 04:17:21.720 align:start position:0%
victims
 
04:17:24.950 --> 04:17:24.960 align:start position:0%
when victims come in it's like
 
04:17:28.070 --> 04:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
the crime just happened yesterday they
 
04:17:30.410 --> 04:17:30.420 align:start position:0%
go right back to the the time that it
 
04:17:33.110 --> 04:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
happened it's really painful to see them
 
04:17:36.010 --> 04:17:36.020 align:start position:0%
having to go through this
 
04:17:39.170 --> 04:17:39.180 align:start position:0%
so keep in mind the effect
 
04:17:43.130 --> 04:17:43.140 align:start position:0%
on victims for people who are sentenced
 
04:17:45.290 --> 04:17:45.300 align:start position:0%
to pretty serious
 
04:17:48.050 --> 04:17:48.060 align:start position:0%
pretty lengthy sentences and to have to
 
04:17:50.450 --> 04:17:50.460 align:start position:0%
cycle them through all of this
 
04:17:52.070 --> 04:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
every time that they get a parole
 
04:17:54.710 --> 04:17:54.720 align:start position:0%
hearing so I'd respectfully ask the
 
04:17:56.389 --> 04:17:56.399 align:start position:0%
committee to find this bill in expedient
 
04:17:58.670 --> 04:17:58.680 align:start position:0%
to legislate and I try to answer any
 
04:18:02.150 --> 04:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:04.189 --> 04:18:04.199 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Rhodes thank
 
04:18:05.809 --> 04:18:05.819 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
04:18:08.269 --> 04:18:08.279 align:start position:0%
question Madam speaker you had mentioned
 
04:18:11.990 --> 04:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
that if a if a person that was in prison
 
04:18:13.910 --> 04:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
has already done this good behavior and
 
04:18:16.010 --> 04:18:16.020 align:start position:0%
so forth that they could ask the judge
 
04:18:18.650 --> 04:18:18.660 align:start position:0%
about a lesser sentence what what would
 
04:18:20.389 --> 04:18:20.399 align:start position:0%
that look like how would that person go
 
04:18:23.510 --> 04:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
about contacting that judge oh they they
 
04:18:27.769 --> 04:18:27.779 align:start position:0%
file a motion uh and they fill out their
 
04:18:30.229 --> 04:18:30.239 align:start position:0%
reasons for it it makes a lot do it
 
04:18:32.630 --> 04:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
themselves some they have family they
 
04:18:34.130 --> 04:18:34.140 align:start position:0%
hire the family might hire a lawyer to
 
04:18:36.610 --> 04:18:36.620 align:start position:0%
do it for him but I've seen uh
 
04:18:39.530 --> 04:18:39.540 align:start position:0%
applications by inmates that get it to
 
04:18:41.510 --> 04:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
the judge they spell out all the good
 
04:18:42.830 --> 04:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
things they've done and their behavior
 
04:18:44.450 --> 04:18:44.460 align:start position:0%
has been wonderful and they've got a job
 
04:18:47.030 --> 04:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
and they've got a place to go and the
 
04:18:48.769 --> 04:18:48.779 align:start position:0%
judge looks at it and says well okay
 
04:18:50.330 --> 04:18:50.340 align:start position:0%
maybe we'll take two years off your
 
04:18:50.340 --> 04:18:52.269 align:start position:0%
maybe we'll take two years off your
sentence

04:18:52.269 --> 04:18:52.279 align:start position:0%
sentence
 
04:18:52.279 --> 04:18:54.229 align:start position:0%
sentence
okay

04:18:54.229 --> 04:18:54.239 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:18:56.929 --> 04:18:56.939 align:start position:0%
um if I may ask what um what what
 
04:18:59.030 --> 04:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
success rate do you see in that how
 
04:19:03.950 --> 04:19:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:07.309 --> 04:19:07.319 align:start position:0%
not a lot
 
04:19:07.319 --> 04:19:08.389 align:start position:0%
not a lot
um

04:19:08.389 --> 04:19:08.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:19:10.790 --> 04:19:10.800 align:start position:0%
I think when I I there are other members
 
04:19:12.710 --> 04:19:12.720 align:start position:0%
of the board here I I don't know how it
 
04:19:15.410 --> 04:19:15.420 align:start position:0%
is no I've been off the board for a year
 
04:19:20.030 --> 04:19:20.040 align:start position:0%
but I would see you know
 
04:19:23.990 --> 04:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe a couple of times a month
 
04:19:26.389 --> 04:19:26.399 align:start position:0%
that it was successful or that yeah it
 
04:19:28.790 --> 04:19:28.800 align:start position:0%
was successful okay because I think all
 
04:19:30.769 --> 04:19:30.779 align:start position:0%
of them ask for it
 
04:19:36.110 --> 04:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
and um as a as a follow-up does the um
 
04:19:38.570 --> 04:19:38.580 align:start position:0%
the board get input into that when
 
04:19:40.910 --> 04:19:40.920 align:start position:0%
someone asks outside of the board to the
 
04:19:43.070 --> 04:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
directly to the judge
 
04:19:44.990 --> 04:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
when somebody is scheduled for a parole
 
04:19:47.150 --> 04:19:47.160 align:start position:0%
hearing uh victims are notified the
 
04:19:49.490 --> 04:19:49.500 align:start position:0%
County Attorney is notified
 
04:19:52.729 --> 04:19:52.739 align:start position:0%
no I mean if someone asks the judge to
 
04:19:55.070 --> 04:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
reduce their sentence without by going
 
04:19:57.170 --> 04:19:57.180 align:start position:0%
around the board to make a motion to
 
04:19:59.630 --> 04:19:59.640 align:start position:0%
have their sentence reviewed the does
 
04:20:01.490 --> 04:20:01.500 align:start position:0%
the board get notified and have input
 
04:20:03.769 --> 04:20:03.779 align:start position:0%
into that no no we only see him if the
 
04:20:06.650 --> 04:20:06.660 align:start position:0%
judge has granted it okay thank you and
 
04:20:08.929 --> 04:20:08.939 align:start position:0%
when we see we would see a lot of people
 
04:20:11.330 --> 04:20:11.340 align:start position:0%
who had applied for it and said I didn't
 
04:20:13.670 --> 04:20:13.680 align:start position:0%
get my two-thirds that's why I'm here
 
04:20:15.229 --> 04:20:15.239 align:start position:0%
today you know
 
04:20:19.070 --> 04:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:20.630 --> 04:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
04:20:20.640 --> 04:20:22.070 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
question

04:20:22.070 --> 04:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:20:25.070 --> 04:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
um I was hoping just to clarify some of
 
04:20:26.929 --> 04:20:26.939 align:start position:0%
your testimony
 
04:20:30.469 --> 04:20:30.479 align:start position:0%
um I think earlier you characterized
 
04:20:33.110 --> 04:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
um the legislation as backdoor reduction
 
04:20:35.689 --> 04:20:35.699 align:start position:0%
of penalty and I was curious if you
 
04:20:38.090 --> 04:20:38.100 align:start position:0%
could um speak to how that contrasts
 
04:20:40.070 --> 04:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
from the existing
 
04:20:42.710 --> 04:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
parole system and and maybe why you
 
04:20:44.750 --> 04:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
don't view the existing parole system as
 
04:20:47.750 --> 04:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
a backdoor reduction of penalty thank
 
04:20:50.210 --> 04:20:50.220 align:start position:0%
you when the judge imposes a sentence he
 
04:20:52.670 --> 04:20:52.680 align:start position:0%
says you're served a minimum of certain
 
04:20:55.070 --> 04:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
number of time and a maximum
 
04:20:56.750 --> 04:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
and that's what everybody expects is
 
04:20:58.729 --> 04:20:58.739 align:start position:0%
going to happen on the sentencing
 
04:21:01.610 --> 04:21:01.620 align:start position:0%
document it's called the Minimus the
 
04:21:03.889 --> 04:21:03.899 align:start position:0%
judge has the spells out what he's what
 
04:21:05.870 --> 04:21:05.880 align:start position:0%
he wants the sentence to be he can also
 
04:21:08.450 --> 04:21:08.460 align:start position:0%
check off are they eligible for earn
 
04:21:10.670 --> 04:21:10.680 align:start position:0%
time credit not everybody is eligible
 
04:21:13.490 --> 04:21:13.500 align:start position:0%
but but the judge is the one who decides
 
04:21:13.500 --> 04:21:14.809 align:start position:0%
but but the judge is the one who decides
so

04:21:14.809 --> 04:21:14.819 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:21:16.790 --> 04:21:16.800 align:start position:0%
here you have a document saying you're
 
04:21:19.490 --> 04:21:19.500 align:start position:0%
sentenced to seven and a half to Fifteen
 
04:21:21.950 --> 04:21:21.960 align:start position:0%
and that's what everybody expects and
 
04:21:24.050 --> 04:21:24.060 align:start position:0%
you might get some time off for earn
 
04:21:27.830 --> 04:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
time and the the there is awareness that
 
04:21:30.229 --> 04:21:30.239 align:start position:0%
there is the ability to uh have a
 
04:21:32.090 --> 04:21:32.100 align:start position:0%
two-thirds reduction
 
04:21:34.070 --> 04:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
but nowhere on there
 
04:21:37.450 --> 04:21:37.460 align:start position:0%
on the sentencing document does it say
 
04:21:41.269 --> 04:21:41.279 align:start position:0%
uh you could get 50 off if you've been a
 
04:21:47.570 --> 04:21:47.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:50.030 --> 04:21:50.040 align:start position:0%
representative selling
 
04:21:52.309 --> 04:21:52.319 align:start position:0%
thank you so much
 
04:21:54.170 --> 04:21:54.180 align:start position:0%
thank you madam speaker and I'm sure
 
04:21:55.670 --> 04:21:55.680 align:start position:0%
you've recognized the greetings I bring
 
04:21:57.229 --> 04:21:57.239 align:start position:0%
you as well
 
04:22:00.410 --> 04:22:00.420 align:start position:0%
um I'm curious with people who apply for
 
04:22:00.420 --> 04:22:01.849 align:start position:0%
um I'm curious with people who apply for
parole

04:22:01.849 --> 04:22:01.859 align:start position:0%
parole
 
04:22:04.849 --> 04:22:04.859 align:start position:0%
um what percentage of people who have
 
04:22:08.570 --> 04:22:08.580 align:start position:0%
committed crimes you referenced as being
 
04:22:10.790 --> 04:22:10.800 align:start position:0%
um worthy of very extended sentences
 
04:22:13.309 --> 04:22:13.319 align:start position:0%
what percentage of them actually are
 
04:22:14.929 --> 04:22:14.939 align:start position:0%
granted parole
 
04:22:17.030 --> 04:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has a very high parole
 
04:22:20.150 --> 04:22:20.160 align:start position:0%
rate and uh I think maybe J Mackey will
 
04:22:23.030 --> 04:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
be testifying can give you the number
 
04:22:25.910 --> 04:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
we parole much
 
04:22:27.950 --> 04:22:27.960 align:start position:0%
our parole rate is much higher than in
 
04:22:30.590 --> 04:22:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:33.290 --> 04:22:33.300 align:start position:0%
we Grant parole more often
 
04:22:36.130 --> 04:22:36.140 align:start position:0%
I want to say
 
04:22:39.349 --> 04:22:39.359 align:start position:0%
68 to 72 percent yeah
 
04:22:39.359 --> 04:22:42.710 align:start position:0%
68 to 72 percent yeah
okay

04:22:42.710 --> 04:22:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:44.990 --> 04:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
representative Newell
 
04:22:46.550 --> 04:22:46.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
04:22:48.290 --> 04:22:48.300 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:22:50.330 --> 04:22:50.340 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to clarify because I
 
04:22:52.729 --> 04:22:52.739 align:start position:0%
think the terminology is similar
 
04:22:55.010 --> 04:22:55.020 align:start position:0%
um mandatory minimum versus you know
 
04:22:57.530 --> 04:22:57.540 align:start position:0%
mandatory minimum being what
 
04:22:59.450 --> 04:22:59.460 align:start position:0%
um what a what would be imposed on a
 
04:23:02.330 --> 04:23:02.340 align:start position:0%
judge right that for a certain uh
 
04:23:03.889 --> 04:23:03.899 align:start position:0%
certain crimes there's a mandatory
 
04:23:06.710 --> 04:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
minimum this is this is saying what the
 
04:23:09.229 --> 04:23:09.239 align:start position:0%
judge chooses to impose based on that
 
04:23:09.239 --> 04:23:10.490 align:start position:0%
judge chooses to impose based on that
crime

04:23:10.490 --> 04:23:10.500 align:start position:0%
crime
 
04:23:13.130 --> 04:23:13.140 align:start position:0%
based on that specific situation that's
 
04:23:15.229 --> 04:23:15.239 align:start position:0%
a question is very has very few
 
04:23:17.030 --> 04:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
mandatory minimums okay
 
04:23:17.040 --> 04:23:20.689 align:start position:0%

so I'm not sure yeah let me I'm sorry
 
04:23:24.769 --> 04:23:24.779 align:start position:0%

clear
 
04:23:28.010 --> 04:23:28.020 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying is is uh are we talking
 
04:23:28.020 --> 04:23:29.269 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying is is uh are we talking
about

04:23:29.269 --> 04:23:29.279 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:23:31.490 --> 04:23:31.500 align:start position:0%
um something that was handed down to the
 
04:23:34.010 --> 04:23:34.020 align:start position:0%
judge that was
 
04:23:36.170 --> 04:23:36.180 align:start position:0%
um not dependent on the specific
 
04:23:39.349 --> 04:23:39.359 align:start position:0%
situation at hand just based on if you
 
04:23:42.110 --> 04:23:42.120 align:start position:0%
are convicted of this crime you there is
 
04:23:43.670 --> 04:23:43.680 align:start position:0%
mandatory minimum that is set for that
 
04:23:45.769 --> 04:23:45.779 align:start position:0%
across the board what we're talking
 
04:23:48.229 --> 04:23:48.239 align:start position:0%
about here if I'm correct so tell me if
 
04:23:51.170 --> 04:23:51.180 align:start position:0%
I'm right or wrong is this is what the
 
04:23:51.180 --> 04:23:52.309 align:start position:0%
I'm right or wrong is this is what the
judge

04:23:52.309 --> 04:23:52.319 align:start position:0%
judge
 
04:23:55.070 --> 04:23:55.080 align:start position:0%
um heard all of the evidence in this
 
04:23:56.630 --> 04:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
particular crime took all things into
 
04:24:00.410 --> 04:24:00.420 align:start position:0%
consideration and then and then uh set
 
04:24:03.170 --> 04:24:03.180 align:start position:0%
this this minimum right okay thank you I
 
04:24:08.050 --> 04:24:08.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:10.370 --> 04:24:10.380 align:start position:0%
representative Bradley
 
04:24:13.250 --> 04:24:13.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:16.550 --> 04:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:17.809 --> 04:24:17.819 align:start position:0%
when you sentencing in New Hampshire
 
04:24:21.530 --> 04:24:21.540 align:start position:0%
back in the 80s the individual that was
 
04:24:25.010 --> 04:24:25.020 align:start position:0%
on Parole and inspired the introduction
 
04:24:29.210 --> 04:24:29.220 align:start position:0%
would they be eligible for parole
 
04:24:37.130 --> 04:24:37.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:41.269 --> 04:24:41.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:44.330 --> 04:24:44.340 align:start position:0%
20. she was 20.
 
04:24:44.340 --> 04:24:47.870 align:start position:0%
20. she was 20.
um

04:24:47.870 --> 04:24:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:49.309 --> 04:24:49.319 align:start position:0%
I don't know whether he was convicted of
 
04:24:50.750 --> 04:24:50.760 align:start position:0%
first-degree murder or a second degree
 
04:24:53.870 --> 04:24:53.880 align:start position:0%
murder yeah it was first degree murder
 
04:24:53.880 --> 04:24:54.889 align:start position:0%
murder yeah it was first degree murder
yeah

04:24:54.889 --> 04:24:54.899 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:24:56.990 --> 04:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
he'd be eligible he wouldn't be eligible
 
04:24:58.550 --> 04:24:58.560 align:start position:0%
under this because first degree murder
 
04:25:00.889 --> 04:25:00.899 align:start position:0%
is excluded okay
 
04:25:02.809 --> 04:25:02.819 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
04:25:05.570 --> 04:25:05.580 align:start position:0%
so let's say that this provision didn't
 
04:25:05.580 --> 04:25:06.590 align:start position:0%
so let's say that this provision didn't
exist

04:25:06.590 --> 04:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
exist
 
04:25:09.290 --> 04:25:09.300 align:start position:0%
and a person applied for parole at their
 
04:25:12.349 --> 04:25:12.359 align:start position:0%
original minimum parole date and they
 
04:25:13.910 --> 04:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
could check the box at all these
 
04:25:15.769 --> 04:25:15.779 align:start position:0%
criteria behaviorally as Parole Board
 
04:25:21.050 --> 04:25:21.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:23.030 --> 04:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
um Madam speaker you don't have to
 
04:25:25.189 --> 04:25:25.199 align:start position:0%
answer that that goes to specific like
 
04:25:26.870 --> 04:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
specific cases okay if you want to ask
 
04:25:28.250 --> 04:25:28.260 align:start position:0%
about the law go ahead no that's okay
 
04:25:32.510 --> 04:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:36.410 --> 04:25:36.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:38.389 --> 04:25:38.399 align:start position:0%
I just have a question on on the 50
 
04:25:41.750 --> 04:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
that's in the new law can people now
 
04:25:44.389 --> 04:25:44.399 align:start position:0%
apply with a minimum sentence apply for
 
04:25:46.189 --> 04:25:46.199 align:start position:0%
a parole and
 
04:25:48.290 --> 04:25:48.300 align:start position:0%
how does that work
 
04:25:50.389 --> 04:25:50.399 align:start position:0%
right now they're eligible for parole at
 
04:25:51.469 --> 04:25:51.479 align:start position:0%
their minimum
 
04:25:54.050 --> 04:25:54.060 align:start position:0%
at the minimum at their minimum so this
 
04:25:55.670 --> 04:25:55.680 align:start position:0%
would reduce the fifty percent you're
 
04:25:57.110 --> 04:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
eligible for parole at your minimum
 
04:26:00.050 --> 04:26:00.060 align:start position:0%
thank you and and they can chip away at
 
04:26:02.570 --> 04:26:02.580 align:start position:0%
their eligibility for parole by earned
 
04:26:04.429 --> 04:26:04.439 align:start position:0%
time credits
 
04:26:07.670 --> 04:26:07.680 align:start position:0%
by completing certain programs
 
04:26:10.370 --> 04:26:10.380 align:start position:0%
so so the minimum changes
 
04:26:12.530 --> 04:26:12.540 align:start position:0%
just for clarification for the committee
 
04:26:16.189 --> 04:26:16.199 align:start position:0%
so if someone has a minimum of 10
 
04:26:19.130 --> 04:26:19.140 align:start position:0%
they can reduce that minimum by
 
04:26:21.769 --> 04:26:21.779 align:start position:0%
completing the programs yeah thank you
 
04:26:24.349 --> 04:26:24.359 align:start position:0%
representative Newman you may follow up
 
04:26:24.359 --> 04:26:28.490 align:start position:0%
representative Newman you may follow up
foreign

04:26:28.490 --> 04:26:28.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:31.429 --> 04:26:31.439 align:start position:0%
the other question was is there are
 
04:26:35.210 --> 04:26:35.220 align:start position:0%
there are minimum sentences uh listed
 
04:26:37.130 --> 04:26:37.140 align:start position:0%
for various crimes
 
04:26:40.189 --> 04:26:40.199 align:start position:0%
and when the person is convicted
 
04:26:43.849 --> 04:26:43.859 align:start position:0%
the judge has the potential to assign a
 
04:26:45.950 --> 04:26:45.960 align:start position:0%
punishment of less than whatever the
 
04:26:49.670 --> 04:26:49.680 align:start position:0%
minimum is at that time is that correct
 
04:26:55.910 --> 04:26:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:58.849 --> 04:26:58.859 align:start position:0%
I'm not I'm not not sure
 
04:27:03.290 --> 04:27:03.300 align:start position:0%
I know that the penalties for a class a
 
04:27:05.769 --> 04:27:05.779 align:start position:0%
felony I believe are seven and a half
 
04:27:08.750 --> 04:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
minimum and for a
 
04:27:10.510 --> 04:27:10.520 align:start position:0%
help me Roger
 
04:27:12.889 --> 04:27:12.899 align:start position:0%
yeah three and a half for a class B
 
04:27:12.899 --> 04:27:15.170 align:start position:0%
yeah three and a half for a class B
felony

04:27:15.170 --> 04:27:15.180 align:start position:0%
felony
 
04:27:15.180 --> 04:27:18.429 align:start position:0%
felony
but

04:27:18.429 --> 04:27:18.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:20.570 --> 04:27:20.580 align:start position:0%
representative Newman are you asking if
 
04:27:22.849 --> 04:27:22.859 align:start position:0%
the judge has the ability to lower a
 
04:27:25.429 --> 04:27:25.439 align:start position:0%
minimum sentence to a plea bargain I'm
 
04:27:27.170 --> 04:27:27.180 align:start position:0%
I'm talking about you having minimum
 
04:27:31.809 --> 04:27:31.819 align:start position:0%
sentence that is assigned but are there
 
04:27:35.689 --> 04:27:35.699 align:start position:0%
can can the punishment given even though
 
04:27:38.330 --> 04:27:38.340 align:start position:0%
there is a minimum sentence and not one
 
04:27:41.450 --> 04:27:41.460 align:start position:0%
that has been put in the law with the
 
04:27:43.790 --> 04:27:43.800 align:start position:0%
particular to that law this is an
 
04:27:45.649 --> 04:27:45.659 align:start position:0%
absolute minimum they can give less than
 
04:27:47.510 --> 04:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
that they can give less than what the
 
04:27:49.490 --> 04:27:49.500 align:start position:0%
minimum is that's defined generally for
 
04:27:56.330 --> 04:27:56.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:00.530 --> 04:28:00.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:06.349 --> 04:28:06.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:06.359 --> 04:28:21.590 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:28:21.590 --> 04:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:26.030 --> 04:28:26.040 align:start position:0%
okay uh Mr chair committee members Aubry
 
04:28:29.570 --> 04:28:29.580 align:start position:0%
Friedman from Bridgewater private person
 
04:28:32.210 --> 04:28:32.220 align:start position:0%
um I support this bill
 
04:28:32.220 --> 04:28:33.050 align:start position:0%
um I support this bill
um

04:28:33.050 --> 04:28:33.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:28:36.469 --> 04:28:36.479 align:start position:0%
I like the idea of uh
 
04:28:38.389 --> 04:28:38.399 align:start position:0%
first of all it pretty much excludes
 
04:28:40.790 --> 04:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
violent crimes so or super violent
 
04:28:42.290 --> 04:28:42.300 align:start position:0%
crimes so you know we're not talking
 
04:28:45.590 --> 04:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
about releasing uh you know serial
 
04:28:49.070 --> 04:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
murders and that type of uh person on
 
04:28:50.210 --> 04:28:50.220 align:start position:0%
the street
 
04:28:54.590 --> 04:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
um that definitely excludes that so how
 
04:28:58.130 --> 04:28:58.140 align:start position:0%
many years a person spends in prison
 
04:29:00.889 --> 04:29:00.899 align:start position:0%
it's pretty arbitrary who knows if they
 
04:29:02.750 --> 04:29:02.760 align:start position:0%
could be there five years ten years they
 
04:29:04.370 --> 04:29:04.380 align:start position:0%
might reform in a couple years they
 
04:29:06.849 --> 04:29:06.859 align:start position:0%
might never reform it's pretty arbitrary
 
04:29:11.149 --> 04:29:11.159 align:start position:0%
so if a person has had good behavior
 
04:29:13.429 --> 04:29:13.439 align:start position:0%
they're not they seem to have been
 
04:29:15.950 --> 04:29:15.960 align:start position:0%
reformed themselves you know they're
 
04:29:18.349 --> 04:29:18.359 align:start position:0%
I say why not give them a second chance
 
04:29:20.090 --> 04:29:20.100 align:start position:0%
what's the advantage of having them
 
04:29:23.269 --> 04:29:23.279 align:start position:0%
staying in prison wasting away for years
 
04:29:27.950 --> 04:29:27.960 align:start position:0%
they're uh is not serving Society
 
04:29:29.689 --> 04:29:29.699 align:start position:0%
um they have my family they you know
 
04:29:31.910 --> 04:29:31.920 align:start position:0%
they could be supporting and be I say
 
04:29:35.929 --> 04:29:35.939 align:start position:0%
give them a second chance earlier to uh
 
04:29:38.090 --> 04:29:38.100 align:start position:0%
at least the chance to get out earlier
 
04:29:40.610 --> 04:29:40.620 align:start position:0%
and and start your life over again and
 
04:29:42.710 --> 04:29:42.720 align:start position:0%
be a productive member of society so I
 
04:29:44.809 --> 04:29:44.819 align:start position:0%
think that's a good idea
 
04:29:47.830 --> 04:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
um as a secondary thing there is a
 
04:29:51.889 --> 04:29:51.899 align:start position:0%
savings to the taxpayer it's a 64
 
04:29:55.790 --> 04:29:55.800 align:start position:0%
000 233 minus 688 so it's about 63 000
 
04:29:58.610 --> 04:29:58.620 align:start position:0%
that's so that's nice but that's you
 
04:30:00.050 --> 04:30:00.060 align:start position:0%
know significant but that's the
 
04:30:02.450 --> 04:30:02.460 align:start position:0%
secondary advantage to not keeping
 
04:30:05.090 --> 04:30:05.100 align:start position:0%
people in prison longer that is not
 
04:30:08.090 --> 04:30:08.100 align:start position:0%
serving Society the only thing I would
 
04:30:10.729 --> 04:30:10.739 align:start position:0%
mention on this bill that I think needs
 
04:30:12.170 --> 04:30:12.180 align:start position:0%
an amendment or maybe I'm not
 
04:30:15.170 --> 04:30:15.180 align:start position:0%
understanding it correctly is
 
04:30:15.180 --> 04:30:16.010 align:start position:0%
understanding it correctly is
um

04:30:16.010 --> 04:30:16.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:30:18.290 --> 04:30:18.300 align:start position:0%
this is in
 
04:30:20.030 --> 04:30:20.040 align:start position:0%
sir that's probably not the correct
 
04:30:21.349 --> 04:30:21.359 align:start position:0%
version there is an amended version
 
04:30:23.570 --> 04:30:23.580 align:start position:0%
coming so okay but I haven't heard this
 
04:30:26.630 --> 04:30:26.640 align:start position:0%
part mentioned yet so I I want to bring
 
04:30:30.170 --> 04:30:30.180 align:start position:0%
it up this is in paragraph uh this is
 
04:30:34.130 --> 04:30:34.140 align:start position:0%
under uh x 10. uh it talks about shall
 
04:30:37.010 --> 04:30:37.020 align:start position:0%
not apply if and this is under section c
 
04:30:39.229 --> 04:30:39.239 align:start position:0%
the person was convicted of committing a
 
04:30:41.990 --> 04:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
violent crime as defined in RSA and then
 
04:30:45.830 --> 04:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
that RSA lists violent you know arson
 
04:30:48.830 --> 04:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
and all these various very violent crime
 
04:30:52.790 --> 04:30:52.800 align:start position:0%
it says except against a person under 18
 
04:30:54.530 --> 04:30:54.540 align:start position:0%
years of age
 
04:30:57.110 --> 04:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
now I don't understand why that to me
 
04:30:59.330 --> 04:30:59.340 align:start position:0%
that land those that last little phrase
 
04:31:02.630 --> 04:31:02.640 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be there why is age if you
 
04:31:04.550 --> 04:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
commit a violent crime whether it's a
 
04:31:07.269 --> 04:31:07.279 align:start position:0%
five-year-old or a 25 year old or a 100
 
04:31:10.610 --> 04:31:10.620 align:start position:0%
somebody 50 or whatever what's the
 
04:31:12.950 --> 04:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
difference it's a violent crime why
 
04:31:16.010 --> 04:31:16.020 align:start position:0%
should the age be significant it's a
 
04:31:18.950 --> 04:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
violent crime and that's it so I I don't
 
04:31:21.530 --> 04:31:21.540 align:start position:0%
understand why that last little phrase
 
04:31:23.330 --> 04:31:23.340 align:start position:0%
is in there this would actually exclude
 
04:31:27.050 --> 04:31:27.060 align:start position:0%
more people actually uh but I think if
 
04:31:28.790 --> 04:31:28.800 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a violent crime it's a
 
04:31:32.330 --> 04:31:32.340 align:start position:0%
violent crime so that's I would maybe
 
04:31:34.010 --> 04:31:34.020 align:start position:0%
mention that as an amendment but
 
04:31:36.649 --> 04:31:36.659 align:start position:0%
otherwise I think the intent of the bill
 
04:31:39.590 --> 04:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
is good and I support it
 
04:31:42.410 --> 04:31:42.420 align:start position:0%
and that's it uh thank you any questions
 
04:31:50.389 --> 04:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:06.170 --> 04:32:06.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:08.389 --> 04:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
this is on yes all right sorry I
 
04:32:08.399 --> 04:32:12.429 align:start position:0%
this is on yes all right sorry I
apologize

04:32:12.429 --> 04:32:12.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:16.309 --> 04:32:16.319 align:start position:0%
thank you um I mean I sit before you in
 
04:32:17.990 --> 04:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
support of this bill as a private
 
04:32:20.570 --> 04:32:20.580 align:start position:0%
citizen I was formally incarcerated I
 
04:32:22.910 --> 04:32:22.920 align:start position:0%
actually did 15 years in prison uh here
 
04:32:24.710 --> 04:32:24.720 align:start position:0%
in Concord I was released about three
 
04:32:27.710 --> 04:32:27.720 align:start position:0%
years ago I went through the uh the
 
04:32:30.349 --> 04:32:30.359 align:start position:0%
system uh
 
04:32:31.969 --> 04:32:31.979 align:start position:0%
being housed in Concord being housed in
 
04:32:34.070 --> 04:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
Berlin also going to minimum security
 
04:32:35.689 --> 04:32:35.699 align:start position:0%
the halfway house
 
04:32:35.699 --> 04:32:38.570 align:start position:0%
the halfway house
I

04:32:38.570 --> 04:32:38.580 align:start position:0%
I
 
04:32:40.790 --> 04:32:40.800 align:start position:0%
actually got some relief
 
04:32:44.630 --> 04:32:44.640 align:start position:0%
with the 65120 and a combination with
 
04:32:47.710 --> 04:32:47.720 align:start position:0%
the earn time credit however I feel that
 
04:32:50.929 --> 04:32:50.939 align:start position:0%
those two laws alone are not enough to
 
04:32:53.030 --> 04:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
help alleviate the situation that we're
 
04:32:54.530 --> 04:32:54.540 align:start position:0%
facing in the state with the prison
 
04:32:56.330 --> 04:32:56.340 align:start position:0%
system which is
 
04:33:00.290 --> 04:33:00.300 align:start position:0%
um lack of resources we're at the max in
 
04:33:02.330 --> 04:33:02.340 align:start position:0%
the prison as far as you know Staffing
 
04:33:05.570 --> 04:33:05.580 align:start position:0%
and how many people we can house by the
 
04:33:07.789 --> 04:33:07.799 align:start position:0%
same time the programs that we have in
 
04:33:08.990 --> 04:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire are very
 
04:33:12.349 --> 04:33:12.359 align:start position:0%
limited and I feel this bill repealing
 
04:33:13.910 --> 04:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
or replacing
 
04:33:19.010 --> 04:33:19.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:20.750 --> 04:33:20.760 align:start position:0%
a move in the positive direction for the
 
04:33:23.090 --> 04:33:23.100 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire
 
04:33:25.131 --> 04:33:25.141 align:start position:0%
I know there's a lot of concerns
 
04:33:27.051 --> 04:33:27.061 align:start position:0%
but I feel that what we have in place
 
04:33:30.890 --> 04:33:30.900 align:start position:0%
with parole is is a great defense in
 
04:33:32.330 --> 04:33:32.340 align:start position:0%
regards to the fears that many of us
 
04:33:35.269 --> 04:33:35.279 align:start position:0%
have releasing the wrong people folks
 
04:33:37.070 --> 04:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
that are inside right now that are
 
04:33:38.929 --> 04:33:38.939 align:start position:0%
aren't doing anything would not get this
 
04:33:40.750 --> 04:33:40.760 align:start position:0%
relief they would go to the parole board
 
04:33:45.949 --> 04:33:45.959 align:start position:0%
and most likely get denied
 
04:33:47.689 --> 04:33:47.699 align:start position:0%
and uh the folks that are doing the
 
04:33:49.250 --> 04:33:49.260 align:start position:0%
right thing they will get the
 
04:33:51.170 --> 04:33:51.180 align:start position:0%
recognition that they need there's folks
 
04:33:51.180 --> 04:33:52.789 align:start position:0%
recognition that they need there's folks
that

04:33:52.789 --> 04:33:52.799 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:33:55.490 --> 04:33:55.500 align:start position:0%
so there's this false sense that 650 120
 
04:33:58.189 --> 04:33:58.199 align:start position:0%
or the earn time credits is uh
 
04:34:02.510 --> 04:34:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:05.269 --> 04:34:05.279 align:start position:0%
the judges recognize who needs to be
 
04:34:07.010 --> 04:34:07.020 align:start position:0%
released and unfortunately that's not
 
04:34:08.510 --> 04:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
that's not always the case obviously
 
04:34:10.970 --> 04:34:10.980 align:start position:0%
from County to County Judge to judge
 
04:34:13.910 --> 04:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of room for
 
04:34:13.920 --> 04:34:14.869 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of room for
um

04:34:14.869 --> 04:34:14.879 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:18.170 --> 04:34:18.180 align:start position:0%
uh subjective interpretations of the law
 
04:34:20.029 --> 04:34:20.039 align:start position:0%
in which folks that I know personally
 
04:34:22.429 --> 04:34:22.439 align:start position:0%
that I feel or I know have done the
 
04:34:24.529 --> 04:34:24.539 align:start position:0%
right things are still struggling to to
 
04:34:27.289 --> 04:34:27.299 align:start position:0%
get that relief and a friend of mine
 
04:34:29.929 --> 04:34:29.939 align:start position:0%
actually is now in the process with the
 
04:34:29.939 --> 04:34:31.131 align:start position:0%
actually is now in the process with the
state

04:34:31.131 --> 04:34:31.141 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:34:33.410 --> 04:34:33.420 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court with appealing the
 
04:34:36.289 --> 04:34:36.299 align:start position:0%
decision that he was denied both 650 120
 
04:34:39.230 --> 04:34:39.240 align:start position:0%
and earn time credit bills which is a
 
04:34:40.789 --> 04:34:40.799 align:start position:0%
grieving Justice when there's folks that
 
04:34:43.070 --> 04:34:43.080 align:start position:0%
don't do anything just sit you know all
 
04:34:45.529 --> 04:34:45.539 align:start position:0%
day in their cells and we'll go to the
 
04:34:47.209 --> 04:34:47.219 align:start position:0%
parole board and we'll get it just
 
04:34:48.830 --> 04:34:48.840 align:start position:0%
because they didn't get any tickets in
 
04:34:50.230 --> 04:34:50.240 align:start position:0%
the past 90 days
 
04:34:52.189 --> 04:34:52.199 align:start position:0%
and you know they didn't commit any new
 
04:34:54.289 --> 04:34:54.299 align:start position:0%
crimes while they were incarcerated
 
04:34:57.470 --> 04:34:57.480 align:start position:0%
so again I just um I am in support of
 
04:34:59.150 --> 04:34:59.160 align:start position:0%
this bill and I hope you folks will too
 
04:35:01.369 --> 04:35:01.379 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:35:03.349 --> 04:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
could you uh would you mind telling us
 
04:35:04.730 --> 04:35:04.740 align:start position:0%
what some of the programs you took
 
04:35:06.769 --> 04:35:06.779 align:start position:0%
advantage of were yes sir
 
04:35:06.779 --> 04:35:07.490 align:start position:0%
advantage of were yes sir
um

04:35:07.490 --> 04:35:07.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:35:08.869 --> 04:35:08.879 align:start position:0%
unfortunately some of the programs that
 
04:35:10.670 --> 04:35:10.680 align:start position:0%
I took no longer exist when I first came
 
04:35:15.650 --> 04:35:15.660 align:start position:0%
in I was uh I had courts
 
04:35:18.109 --> 04:35:18.119 align:start position:0%
um how do you say I'm sorry
 
04:35:20.929 --> 04:35:20.939 align:start position:0%
Court referred programs that with the
 
04:35:22.490 --> 04:35:22.500 align:start position:0%
amount of time I did I was originally
 
04:35:26.090 --> 04:35:26.100 align:start position:0%
sent this to 18 years completed 15.
 
04:35:28.429 --> 04:35:28.439 align:start position:0%
some of those laws by the time I came
 
04:35:29.810 --> 04:35:29.820 align:start position:0%
close enough to be eligible to
 
04:35:31.670 --> 04:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
participate in those programs they no
 
04:35:32.810 --> 04:35:32.820 align:start position:0%
longer existed and they were actually
 
04:35:34.849 --> 04:35:34.859 align:start position:0%
waived but I was able to do some things
 
04:35:37.250 --> 04:35:37.260 align:start position:0%
on my own uh one of the programs which
 
04:35:38.570 --> 04:35:38.580 align:start position:0%
again no longer exists in New Hampshire
 
04:35:39.830 --> 04:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
is the Alternatives the violence
 
04:35:39.840 --> 04:35:41.209 align:start position:0%
is the Alternatives the violence
projects

04:35:41.209 --> 04:35:41.219 align:start position:0%
projects
 
04:35:41.219 --> 04:35:41.990 align:start position:0%
projects
um

04:35:41.990 --> 04:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:35:45.529 --> 04:35:45.539 align:start position:0%
which was a a conflict resolution uh
 
04:35:48.109 --> 04:35:48.119 align:start position:0%
course uh it was it's made up of several
 
04:35:49.970 --> 04:35:49.980 align:start position:0%
workshops that are two to three days
 
04:35:52.429 --> 04:35:52.439 align:start position:0%
long again conflict resolution
 
04:35:54.590 --> 04:35:54.600 align:start position:0%
communicate uh you know building
 
04:35:56.990 --> 04:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
communication skills
 
04:35:58.789 --> 04:35:58.799 align:start position:0%
um Community Building
 
04:36:01.070 --> 04:36:01.080 align:start position:0%
etc etc but again fortunately that
 
04:36:02.570 --> 04:36:02.580 align:start position:0%
program no longer exists I also
 
04:36:04.150 --> 04:36:04.160 align:start position:0%
participated in the Hobbycraft program
 
04:36:06.551 --> 04:36:06.561 align:start position:0%
which is run by the recreation
 
04:36:08.750 --> 04:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
Recreation Department in the prison
 
04:36:11.510 --> 04:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
which allowed folks to um
 
04:36:13.670 --> 04:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
first of all it was incentive based you
 
04:36:15.349 --> 04:36:15.359 align:start position:0%
had to be right up free you would have a
 
04:36:17.209 --> 04:36:17.219 align:start position:0%
job you were putting on a waiting list
 
04:36:19.131 --> 04:36:19.141 align:start position:0%
as long as you maintain those things you
 
04:36:20.990 --> 04:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
entered this program where you had the
 
04:36:22.970 --> 04:36:22.980 align:start position:0%
choice of uh learning how to build
 
04:36:26.390 --> 04:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
Furniture arts and crafts
 
04:36:29.029 --> 04:36:29.039 align:start position:0%
um jewelry making and it also allowed
 
04:36:31.131 --> 04:36:31.141 align:start position:0%
you to
 
04:36:31.141 --> 04:36:32.689 align:start position:0%
you to
uh

04:36:32.689 --> 04:36:32.699 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:36:35.750 --> 04:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
make money legitimately because of the
 
04:36:37.131 --> 04:36:37.141 align:start position:0%
retail store
 
04:36:39.109 --> 04:36:39.119 align:start position:0%
some other programs I participated in
 
04:36:41.410 --> 04:36:41.420 align:start position:0%
whereas anger management
 
04:36:45.490 --> 04:36:45.500 align:start position:0%
I was also a student at the high school
 
04:36:48.650 --> 04:36:48.660 align:start position:0%
the Concord has its own high school the
 
04:36:49.970 --> 04:36:49.980 align:start position:0%
prison I'm sorry
 
04:36:51.230 --> 04:36:51.240 align:start position:0%
so I was able to get my high school
 
04:36:51.240 --> 04:36:53.631 align:start position:0%
so I was able to get my high school
diploma

04:36:53.631 --> 04:36:53.641 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:55.310 --> 04:36:55.320 align:start position:0%
geez there's a lot of things that I I
 
04:36:57.051 --> 04:36:57.061 align:start position:0%
did I wish I had brought something I
 
04:36:59.570 --> 04:36:59.580 align:start position:0%
could show you folks but again not
 
04:37:01.010 --> 04:37:01.020 align:start position:0%
everybody is super motivated a lot of
 
04:37:03.230 --> 04:37:03.240 align:start position:0%
these programs were volunteer based they
 
04:37:07.189 --> 04:37:07.199 align:start position:0%
were not mandatory uh and again the the
 
04:37:08.869 --> 04:37:08.879 align:start position:0%
main reason for that was because of the
 
04:37:10.189 --> 04:37:10.199 align:start position:0%
lack of resources that we have again
 
04:37:12.230 --> 04:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
Staffing is an issue
 
04:37:13.250 --> 04:37:13.260 align:start position:0%
um it's just a trickle-down effect
 
04:37:16.070 --> 04:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
unfortunately if um if you go back and
 
04:37:17.570 --> 04:37:17.580 align:start position:0%
look at when this law was passed
 
04:37:18.949 --> 04:37:18.959 align:start position:0%
originally the truth and sentencing law
 
04:37:21.470 --> 04:37:21.480 align:start position:0%
the population of the prison was like
 
04:37:23.390 --> 04:37:23.400 align:start position:0%
two three hundred people and now we're
 
04:37:25.490 --> 04:37:25.500 align:start position:0%
talking about you know 2 000 plus folks
 
04:37:27.170 --> 04:37:27.180 align:start position:0%
between the several facilities we've had
 
04:37:29.209 --> 04:37:29.219 align:start position:0%
to add more facilities but in that same
 
04:37:32.029 --> 04:37:32.039 align:start position:0%
amount of time the population of the pr
 
04:37:35.269 --> 04:37:35.279 align:start position:0%
of the state has changed very little and
 
04:37:37.490 --> 04:37:37.500 align:start position:0%
the crime rate has been more or less the
 
04:37:40.310 --> 04:37:40.320 align:start position:0%
same however the population has of the
 
04:37:43.131 --> 04:37:43.141 align:start position:0%
prison has increased and I believe that
 
04:37:45.230 --> 04:37:45.240 align:start position:0%
it's directly because of Truth and
 
04:37:45.240 --> 04:37:46.490 align:start position:0%
it's directly because of Truth and
sentencing

04:37:46.490 --> 04:37:46.500 align:start position:0%
sentencing
 
04:37:49.490 --> 04:37:49.500 align:start position:0%
and one more question for me the
 
04:37:51.289 --> 04:37:51.299 align:start position:0%
programs that you availed yourself of
 
04:37:53.330 --> 04:37:53.340 align:start position:0%
while you were incarcerated have you
 
04:37:55.670 --> 04:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
been able to apply those to help you
 
04:37:57.170 --> 04:37:57.180 align:start position:0%
since you've been out were they
 
04:37:59.390 --> 04:37:59.400 align:start position:0%
beneficial to you once you get outside
 
04:37:59.400 --> 04:38:00.949 align:start position:0%
beneficial to you once you get outside
yes

04:38:00.949 --> 04:38:00.959 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:38:02.449 --> 04:38:02.459 align:start position:0%
and no
 
04:38:04.910 --> 04:38:04.920 align:start position:0%
I would say there are some things that
 
04:38:07.189 --> 04:38:07.199 align:start position:0%
obviously they stick with you that do
 
04:38:08.929 --> 04:38:08.939 align:start position:0%
not need practice or you don't need
 
04:38:10.551 --> 04:38:10.561 align:start position:0%
anything to practice with and what I
 
04:38:11.750 --> 04:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
mean by that is uh there are some
 
04:38:13.551 --> 04:38:13.561 align:start position:0%
courses I took in there that had to do
 
04:38:15.349 --> 04:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
with technology unfortunately there's
 
04:38:17.631 --> 04:38:17.641 align:start position:0%
very limited
 
04:38:19.551 --> 04:38:19.561 align:start position:0%
um employment opportunities Behind the
 
04:38:21.709 --> 04:38:21.719 align:start position:0%
Walls that allow you to utilize that so
 
04:38:24.349 --> 04:38:24.359 align:start position:0%
I was able to take advantage of that
 
04:38:26.090 --> 04:38:26.100 align:start position:0%
um but not everybody is one of the
 
04:38:27.890 --> 04:38:27.900 align:start position:0%
positions that I held was a clerk for
 
04:38:29.990 --> 04:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
the recreation department in which I was
 
04:38:32.990 --> 04:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
basically you know had access to the
 
04:38:35.029 --> 04:38:35.039 align:start position:0%
computer you know printing documents
 
04:38:37.609 --> 04:38:37.619 align:start position:0%
emailing documents under supervision of
 
04:38:39.349 --> 04:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
Staff of course
 
04:38:41.390 --> 04:38:41.400 align:start position:0%
um and I was able to utilize some of the
 
04:38:43.849 --> 04:38:43.859 align:start position:0%
other skills that I learned while there
 
04:38:45.230 --> 04:38:45.240 align:start position:0%
but a lot of things that you just
 
04:38:47.090 --> 04:38:47.100 align:start position:0%
unfortunately can't
 
04:38:48.890 --> 04:38:48.900 align:start position:0%
um because there again there's nothing
 
04:38:51.890 --> 04:38:51.900 align:start position:0%
to follow up with in order to to apply
 
04:38:53.090 --> 04:38:53.100 align:start position:0%
those skills that you learn while you're
 
04:38:55.310 --> 04:38:55.320 align:start position:0%
in there
 
04:38:57.590 --> 04:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
representative sailing
 
04:38:59.150 --> 04:38:59.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
04:38:59.160 --> 04:39:00.349 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

04:39:00.349 --> 04:39:00.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:39:05.510 --> 04:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:09.349 --> 04:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
I'm good and if the skills that you
 
04:39:11.390 --> 04:39:11.400 align:start position:0%
developed between the high school
 
04:39:13.789 --> 04:39:13.799 align:start position:0%
program and the system and some of the
 
04:39:17.390 --> 04:39:17.400 align:start position:0%
others allowed for you to have supported
 
04:39:19.310 --> 04:39:19.320 align:start position:0%
employment once you were able to earn
 
04:39:21.109 --> 04:39:21.119 align:start position:0%
your release
 
04:39:22.910 --> 04:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
that's a great question to Mom so I was
 
04:39:25.131 --> 04:39:25.141 align:start position:0%
23 years old when I was originally
 
04:39:25.141 --> 04:39:26.689 align:start position:0%
23 years old when I was originally
incarcerated

04:39:26.689 --> 04:39:26.699 align:start position:0%
incarcerated
 
04:39:26.699 --> 04:39:28.131 align:start position:0%
incarcerated
um

04:39:28.131 --> 04:39:28.141 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:39:30.470 --> 04:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
some of the skills that I learned could
 
04:39:32.810 --> 04:39:32.820 align:start position:0%
be I could have I couldn't I guess you
 
04:39:35.090 --> 04:39:35.100 align:start position:0%
could say apply but unfortunately one of
 
04:39:37.970 --> 04:39:37.980 align:start position:0%
the big things that is is lacking is
 
04:39:37.980 --> 04:39:39.050 align:start position:0%
the big things that is is lacking is
um

04:39:39.050 --> 04:39:39.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:39:40.490 --> 04:39:40.500 align:start position:0%
you know connections with the community
 
04:39:43.190 --> 04:39:43.200 align:start position:0%
so as far as being able to find uh
 
04:39:45.288 --> 04:39:45.298 align:start position:0%
gainful employment was a challenge for
 
04:39:47.690 --> 04:39:47.700 align:start position:0%
me I I literally had no idea what I was
 
04:39:49.490 --> 04:39:49.500 align:start position:0%
going to do when I got out I was willing
 
04:39:51.470 --> 04:39:51.480 align:start position:0%
to do just about anything legitimately
 
04:39:54.110 --> 04:39:54.120 align:start position:0%
in order to to support myself and my
 
04:39:54.120 --> 04:39:55.850 align:start position:0%
in order to to support myself and my
family

04:39:55.850 --> 04:39:55.860 align:start position:0%
family
 
04:39:58.368 --> 04:39:58.378 align:start position:0%
um but I would say some of the the
 
04:40:00.948 --> 04:40:00.958 align:start position:0%
positives were because of my in
 
04:40:02.330 --> 04:40:02.340 align:start position:0%
participation some of the program in
 
04:40:04.190 --> 04:40:04.200 align:start position:0%
there is kind of networking build you
 
04:40:05.570 --> 04:40:05.580 align:start position:0%
know getting to meet folks that
 
04:40:08.270 --> 04:40:08.280 align:start position:0%
volunteered that once I was outside that
 
04:40:10.010 --> 04:40:10.020 align:start position:0%
I was able to reconnect with them they
 
04:40:12.590 --> 04:40:12.600 align:start position:0%
were able to help me find a meaningful
 
04:40:14.990 --> 04:40:15.000 align:start position:0%
employment but uh again one of the
 
04:40:16.850 --> 04:40:16.860 align:start position:0%
programs I did to participate in while I
 
04:40:19.730 --> 04:40:19.740 align:start position:0%
was was locked up was um in minimum
 
04:40:22.850 --> 04:40:22.860 align:start position:0%
security was with the dot program and
 
04:40:24.770 --> 04:40:24.780 align:start position:0%
actually was able to gain employment
 
04:40:26.990 --> 04:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
through that through them but again not
 
04:40:29.510 --> 04:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
something that I felt was uh
 
04:40:33.230 --> 04:40:33.240 align:start position:0%
complementary to to my my skills but it
 
04:40:35.810 --> 04:40:35.820 align:start position:0%
was something that was steady you know
 
04:40:37.610 --> 04:40:37.620 align:start position:0%
got me outside
 
04:40:40.130 --> 04:40:40.140 align:start position:0%
um making a steady income but again
 
04:40:41.510 --> 04:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
these are opportunities that are very
 
04:40:45.410 --> 04:40:45.420 align:start position:0%
limited very limited and uh
 
04:40:46.910 --> 04:40:46.920 align:start position:0%
I could have been exposed to a lot
 
04:40:49.550 --> 04:40:49.560 align:start position:0%
sooner had uh truth and sentencing I've
 
04:40:53.390 --> 04:40:53.400 align:start position:0%
been been an obstacle and again again so
 
04:40:55.368 --> 04:40:55.378 align:start position:0%
when I say I did get some relief from
 
04:40:57.830 --> 04:40:57.840 align:start position:0%
650 120 and from the earn time credit it
 
04:41:00.410 --> 04:41:00.420 align:start position:0%
was very limited uh so earn time credit
 
04:41:02.270 --> 04:41:02.280 align:start position:0%
the max amount of time that you can get
 
04:41:04.550 --> 04:41:04.560 align:start position:0%
off is 21 months however the only way
 
04:41:06.410 --> 04:41:06.420 align:start position:0%
that you can maximize that at the time
 
04:41:08.810 --> 04:41:08.820 align:start position:0%
that I was I was inside was college
 
04:41:10.430 --> 04:41:10.440 align:start position:0%
you'd have to take college courses and
 
04:41:12.770 --> 04:41:12.780 align:start position:0%
you'd have to get a an association or a
 
04:41:12.780 --> 04:41:14.090 align:start position:0%
you'd have to get a an association or a
Bachelors

04:41:14.090 --> 04:41:14.100 align:start position:0%
Bachelors
 
04:41:17.510 --> 04:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
in order to to realize or or have that
 
04:41:17.520 --> 04:41:18.410 align:start position:0%
in order to to realize or or have that
um

04:41:18.410 --> 04:41:18.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:41:20.270 --> 04:41:20.280 align:start position:0%
be able to
 
04:41:22.310 --> 04:41:22.320 align:start position:0%
be eligible for the the full 21 months
 
04:41:24.288 --> 04:41:24.298 align:start position:0%
so I got 10 months
 
04:41:27.470 --> 04:41:27.480 align:start position:0%
um from that and then the uh truth and
 
04:41:28.850 --> 04:41:28.860 align:start position:0%
sentence I mean truth consensus in the
 
04:41:28.860 --> 04:41:30.590 align:start position:0%
sentence I mean truth consensus in the
65120

04:41:30.590 --> 04:41:30.600 align:start position:0%
65120
 
04:41:33.770 --> 04:41:33.780 align:start position:0%
um I could have got six years is what I
 
04:41:35.090 --> 04:41:35.100 align:start position:0%
would have been eligible for that was a
 
04:41:36.470 --> 04:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
third of my sentence that could have got
 
04:41:38.868 --> 04:41:38.878 align:start position:0%
suspended unfortunately at that time the
 
04:41:41.030 --> 04:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
process it took me about a year before I
 
04:41:42.288 --> 04:41:42.298 align:start position:0%
could get into court because I was
 
04:41:44.270 --> 04:41:44.280 align:start position:0%
seeking approval from uh the
 
04:41:47.628 --> 04:41:47.638 align:start position:0%
commissioner and um just the whole
 
04:41:49.670 --> 04:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
process again of going to courts so I
 
04:41:50.930 --> 04:41:50.940 align:start position:0%
would have never realized the full six
 
04:41:53.330 --> 04:41:53.340 align:start position:0%
years at the time that I did see get in
 
04:41:54.830 --> 04:41:54.840 align:start position:0%
front of a judge I would have been
 
04:41:58.970 --> 04:41:58.980 align:start position:0%
eligible for five and I received two and
 
04:42:01.610 --> 04:42:01.620 align:start position:0%
as grateful as I am for that relief I
 
04:42:04.070 --> 04:42:04.080 align:start position:0%
felt that I deserved the whole five
 
04:42:06.470 --> 04:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
years again if I had a resume of the the
 
04:42:07.610 --> 04:42:07.620 align:start position:0%
amount of things that I did while I was
 
04:42:09.110 --> 04:42:09.120 align:start position:0%
in prison that were positive you know
 
04:42:11.930 --> 04:42:11.940 align:start position:0%
programs volunteering Etc
 
04:42:11.940 --> 04:42:12.530 align:start position:0%
programs volunteering Etc
um

04:42:12.530 --> 04:42:12.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:14.330 --> 04:42:14.340 align:start position:0%
you know I had some of my peers say if
 
04:42:15.530 --> 04:42:15.540 align:start position:0%
you if you're not going to get the full
 
04:42:17.090 --> 04:42:17.100 align:start position:0%
five years then who's gonna get the full
 
04:42:19.250 --> 04:42:19.260 align:start position:0%
five years and again it's one of those
 
04:42:20.390 --> 04:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
things where it's very subjective
 
04:42:22.010 --> 04:42:22.020 align:start position:0%
depending on the judge and the county
 
04:42:24.830 --> 04:42:24.840 align:start position:0%
that you belong to and even maybe the
 
04:42:27.470 --> 04:42:27.480 align:start position:0%
I guess the notoriety beyond your your
 
04:42:30.708 --> 04:42:30.718 align:start position:0%
crime unfortunately
 
04:42:32.150 --> 04:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
representative Rhodes
 
04:42:33.708 --> 04:42:33.718 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
04:42:35.510 --> 04:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question I don't mean to put
 
04:42:37.070 --> 04:42:37.080 align:start position:0%
you on the spot and ask you to speak for
 
04:42:38.930 --> 04:42:38.940 align:start position:0%
for anybody else so I apologize about
 
04:42:41.750 --> 04:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
how that's how this comes off you had
 
04:42:43.190 --> 04:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
mentioned that you went through the the
 
04:42:44.510 --> 04:42:44.520 align:start position:0%
programs and did what you were supposed
 
04:42:46.490 --> 04:42:46.500 align:start position:0%
to do and and took these classes can you
 
04:42:49.310 --> 04:42:49.320 align:start position:0%
give me an example other than yourself
 
04:42:51.230 --> 04:42:51.240 align:start position:0%
how many people you were incarcerated
 
04:42:51.240 --> 04:42:52.368 align:start position:0%
how many people you were incarcerated
with

04:42:52.368 --> 04:42:52.378 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:42:56.448 --> 04:42:56.458 align:start position:0%
that did the same approximate percentage
 
04:42:59.690 --> 04:42:59.700 align:start position:0%
I would that is a tough question
 
04:42:59.700 --> 04:43:02.810 align:start position:0%
I would that is a tough question
um

04:43:02.810 --> 04:43:02.820 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:06.110 --> 04:43:06.120 align:start position:0%
it's a minority it is a minority
 
04:43:06.120 --> 04:43:08.510 align:start position:0%
it's a minority it is a minority
um

04:43:08.510 --> 04:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:09.770 --> 04:43:09.780 align:start position:0%
and maybe this is a very conservative
 
04:43:11.990 --> 04:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
number I would say you know two three
 
04:43:12.000 --> 04:43:12.948 align:start position:0%

representative Newell
 
04:43:19.670 --> 04:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
04:43:21.230 --> 04:43:21.240 align:start position:0%
taking my question and thank you for
 
04:43:22.490 --> 04:43:22.500 align:start position:0%
coming here I really appreciate you
 
04:43:25.070 --> 04:43:25.080 align:start position:0%
coming and sharing your story and I'm
 
04:43:27.590 --> 04:43:27.600 align:start position:0%
just curious if looking at the
 
04:43:29.030 --> 04:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
parameters of the bill would this have
 
04:43:31.788 --> 04:43:31.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:31.798 --> 04:43:32.990 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:43:32.990 --> 04:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:35.208 --> 04:43:35.218 align:start position:0%
I believe I believe so again I'm not
 
04:43:37.910 --> 04:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
fully I don't know the exact details but
 
04:43:39.770 --> 04:43:39.780 align:start position:0%
I believe so I would okay and I don't I
 
04:43:40.970 --> 04:43:40.980 align:start position:0%
don't want to get you personal or
 
04:43:43.070 --> 04:43:43.080 align:start position:0%
anything like that so so yeah thank you
 
04:43:45.170 --> 04:43:45.180 align:start position:0%
I appreciate it you're welcome
 
04:43:47.270 --> 04:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler thank you Mr
 
04:43:47.280 --> 04:43:48.590 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler thank you Mr
chair

04:43:48.590 --> 04:43:48.600 align:start position:0%
chair
 
04:43:50.810 --> 04:43:50.820 align:start position:0%
speaker scitec former speaker scitec
 
04:43:52.750 --> 04:43:52.760 align:start position:0%
brought up uh how victims could be
 
04:43:54.530 --> 04:43:54.540 align:start position:0%
re-traumatized from something like do
 
04:43:56.208 --> 04:43:56.218 align:start position:0%
you see how we could balance the
 
04:43:59.090 --> 04:43:59.100 align:start position:0%
concerns of those individuals who may be
 
04:44:00.650 --> 04:44:00.660 align:start position:0%
traumatized from an event that had
 
04:44:03.050 --> 04:44:03.060 align:start position:0%
happened and how we could rehabilitate
 
04:44:05.570 --> 04:44:05.580 align:start position:0%
the people that are incarcerated the
 
04:44:07.430 --> 04:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
balance between uh the trauma that
 
04:44:09.590 --> 04:44:09.600 align:start position:0%
they're affecting that they have and the
 
04:44:10.910 --> 04:44:10.920 align:start position:0%
rehabilitative process for the
 
04:44:13.430 --> 04:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
incarcerated individual
 
04:44:15.948 --> 04:44:15.958 align:start position:0%
no I absolutely I feel there are steps
 
04:44:17.750 --> 04:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
that can can be taken to prevent that
 
04:44:19.250 --> 04:44:19.260 align:start position:0%
because that is a very
 
04:44:21.170 --> 04:44:21.180 align:start position:0%
um important concern
 
04:44:22.610 --> 04:44:22.620 align:start position:0%
um for the victims and even for the the
 
04:44:24.110 --> 04:44:24.120 align:start position:0%
offenders themselves you know to have to
 
04:44:26.090 --> 04:44:26.100 align:start position:0%
relive that you know because
 
04:44:27.890 --> 04:44:27.900 align:start position:0%
you know it's traumatizing on both sides
 
04:44:27.900 --> 04:44:29.570 align:start position:0%
you know it's traumatizing on both sides
obviously

04:44:29.570 --> 04:44:29.580 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
04:44:29.580 --> 04:44:31.550 align:start position:0%
obviously
um

04:44:31.550 --> 04:44:31.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:44:36.650 --> 04:44:36.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:38.930 --> 04:44:38.940 align:start position:0%
you know of good behavior you know
 
04:44:41.390 --> 04:44:41.400 align:start position:0%
having having done the extra work in
 
04:44:43.610 --> 04:44:43.620 align:start position:0%
order to be eligible for parole
 
04:44:44.750 --> 04:44:44.760 align:start position:0%
um and I think that is the step
 
04:44:47.090 --> 04:44:47.100 align:start position:0%
beforehand to just you can kind of
 
04:44:51.110 --> 04:44:51.120 align:start position:0%
filter out who would be prepared to get
 
04:44:54.050 --> 04:44:54.060 align:start position:0%
that that 50 relief
 
04:44:55.550 --> 04:44:55.560 align:start position:0%
um and if not then then they shouldn't
 
04:44:56.990 --> 04:44:57.000 align:start position:0%
be in front of them in front of the poor
 
04:45:02.270 --> 04:45:02.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:12.128 --> 04:45:12.138 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:16.550 --> 04:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes his attorney Andres
 
04:45:16.560 --> 04:45:18.170 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes his attorney Andres
and

04:45:18.170 --> 04:45:18.180 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:45:20.868 --> 04:45:20.878 align:start position:0%
struts and
 
04:45:30.230 --> 04:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:32.208 --> 04:45:32.218 align:start position:0%
thank you we thought we'd come up
 
04:45:33.890 --> 04:45:33.900 align:start position:0%
together to try to answer all of your
 
04:45:36.288 --> 04:45:36.298 align:start position:0%
questions at the same time
 
04:45:38.208 --> 04:45:38.218 align:start position:0%
um our office does oppose this bill and
 
04:45:39.470 --> 04:45:39.480 align:start position:0%
I'll explain why and then we'll answer
 
04:45:41.390 --> 04:45:41.400 align:start position:0%
any questions that you have
 
04:45:43.550 --> 04:45:43.560 align:start position:0%
first it's not clear why this bill is
 
04:45:45.470 --> 04:45:45.480 align:start position:0%
necessary when I read the bill
 
04:45:47.510 --> 04:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
I tried to discern what the what the
 
04:45:48.948 --> 04:45:48.958 align:start position:0%
purpose is what's behind it and I
 
04:45:50.390 --> 04:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
contacted the Department of Corrections
 
04:45:52.070 --> 04:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
the commissioner Helen Hanks and I asked
 
04:45:54.110 --> 04:45:54.120 align:start position:0%
her for the numbers of incarcerated
 
04:45:55.730 --> 04:45:55.740 align:start position:0%
individuals in New Hampshire and I found
 
04:45:57.770 --> 04:45:57.780 align:start position:0%
out that the last nine years that number
 
04:45:59.690 --> 04:45:59.700 align:start position:0%
has dropped 30 percent
 
04:46:02.810 --> 04:46:02.820 align:start position:0%
30 percent drop in nine years so there
 
04:46:04.670 --> 04:46:04.680 align:start position:0%
is no issue with mass incarceration in
 
04:46:05.448 --> 04:46:05.458 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we're actually
 
04:46:07.910 --> 04:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
incarcerating lost unless people each
 
04:46:10.128 --> 04:46:10.138 align:start position:0%
and every year so that can't be a
 
04:46:13.010 --> 04:46:13.020 align:start position:0%
justification for the bill
 
04:46:13.020 --> 04:46:14.410 align:start position:0%
justification for the bill
um

04:46:14.410 --> 04:46:14.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:46:17.448 --> 04:46:17.458 align:start position:0%
we have a rigorous and thorough
 
04:46:19.190 --> 04:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
sentencing system in New Hampshire and
 
04:46:21.050 --> 04:46:21.060 align:start position:0%
we live that system and we can explain
 
04:46:23.030 --> 04:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
to you how it works
 
04:46:24.590 --> 04:46:24.600 align:start position:0%
um one of the questions that came from
 
04:46:26.810 --> 04:46:26.820 align:start position:0%
representative talked asked about I
 
04:46:28.250 --> 04:46:28.260 align:start position:0%
think about mandatory sentences or
 
04:46:29.690 --> 04:46:29.700 align:start position:0%
minimum sentences
 
04:46:32.090 --> 04:46:32.100 align:start position:0%
almost no crime in New Hampshire has a
 
04:46:34.430 --> 04:46:34.440 align:start position:0%
mandatory minimum sentence almost none
 
04:46:36.288 --> 04:46:36.298 align:start position:0%
an example is first degree murder which
 
04:46:38.628 --> 04:46:38.638 align:start position:0%
is a mandatory life without parole but
 
04:46:40.368 --> 04:46:40.378 align:start position:0%
almost every single sentence in New
 
04:46:42.610 --> 04:46:42.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is the result of a long
 
04:46:45.530 --> 04:46:45.540 align:start position:0%
deliberate thorough process that process
 
04:46:47.510 --> 04:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
involves the judge listening to both
 
04:46:50.690 --> 04:46:50.700 align:start position:0%
sides considering the facts from both
 
04:46:53.868 --> 04:46:53.878 align:start position:0%
sides hearing victim input and applying
 
04:46:55.788 --> 04:46:55.798 align:start position:0%
the law that applies to sentencing in
 
04:46:58.250 --> 04:46:58.260 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that is the process that
 
04:47:00.350 --> 04:47:00.360 align:start position:0%
creates a sentence in New Hampshire it
 
04:47:02.330 --> 04:47:02.340 align:start position:0%
is a very deliberate process it's not
 
04:47:04.490 --> 04:47:04.500 align:start position:0%
spontaneous and it's something that has
 
04:47:07.610 --> 04:47:07.620 align:start position:0%
input from all sides and this bill would
 
04:47:10.190 --> 04:47:10.200 align:start position:0%
undo it it would undo it because not
 
04:47:12.350 --> 04:47:12.360 align:start position:0%
only because it gives people a chance to
 
04:47:13.850 --> 04:47:13.860 align:start position:0%
cut their senses in half but because
 
04:47:16.430 --> 04:47:16.440 align:start position:0%
that comes on top of a system that
 
04:47:18.708 --> 04:47:18.718 align:start position:0%
already provides for multiple reviews of
 
04:47:21.110 --> 04:47:21.120 align:start position:0%
sentences and reductions so first of all
 
04:47:22.730 --> 04:47:22.740 align:start position:0%
if someone is convicted they can
 
04:47:24.890 --> 04:47:24.900 align:start position:0%
obviously appeal the legality of their
 
04:47:26.330 --> 04:47:26.340 align:start position:0%
sentence to the New Hampshire Supreme
 
04:47:27.770 --> 04:47:27.780 align:start position:0%
Court that can be part of the appeal
 
04:47:30.650 --> 04:47:30.660 align:start position:0%
process second they have What's called
 
04:47:32.330 --> 04:47:32.340 align:start position:0%
the sentence review board and in New
 
04:47:33.890 --> 04:47:33.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that's a three-judge panel
 
04:47:36.948 --> 04:47:36.958 align:start position:0%
that reviews sentences they can raise
 
04:47:38.750 --> 04:47:38.760 align:start position:0%
the sentence lower the sentence or leave
 
04:47:40.368 --> 04:47:40.378 align:start position:0%
it the same but defendants have the
 
04:47:42.650 --> 04:47:42.660 align:start position:0%
right to that process in New Hampshire
 
04:47:44.628 --> 04:47:44.638 align:start position:0%
you've heard about this chance to get up
 
04:47:47.030 --> 04:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
to 21 months off that's called earn time
 
04:47:49.550 --> 04:47:49.560 align:start position:0%
credits inmates have the chance to do a
 
04:47:51.830 --> 04:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
variety of different things and many of
 
04:47:53.390 --> 04:47:53.400 align:start position:0%
these things are not very rigorous
 
04:47:55.610 --> 04:47:55.620 align:start position:0%
they're not college degrees they're just
 
04:47:57.948 --> 04:47:57.958 align:start position:0%
classes seminars in the prison that are
 
04:48:00.288 --> 04:48:00.298 align:start position:0%
approved and in total they can get 21
 
04:48:02.270 --> 04:48:02.280 align:start position:0%
months off almost two years off their
 
04:48:02.280 --> 04:48:03.230 align:start position:0%
months off almost two years off their
sense

04:48:03.230 --> 04:48:03.240 align:start position:0%
sense
 
04:48:05.208 --> 04:48:05.218 align:start position:0%
the last thing is that the law provides
 
04:48:07.010 --> 04:48:07.020 align:start position:0%
something called sentence reduction
 
04:48:10.250 --> 04:48:10.260 align:start position:0%
which is an RSA 651 colon 20. and that
 
04:48:12.350 --> 04:48:12.360 align:start position:0%
allows someone to petition to have their
 
04:48:14.930 --> 04:48:14.940 align:start position:0%
Senate reduced by up to one-third so
 
04:48:17.030 --> 04:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
there are a combination of things in
 
04:48:19.190 --> 04:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
place that allows a convicted individual
 
04:48:20.868 --> 04:48:20.878 align:start position:0%
to have their propriety of their
 
04:48:22.868 --> 04:48:22.878 align:start position:0%
sentence reviewed and potentially
 
04:48:25.610 --> 04:48:25.620 align:start position:0%
reduced and those all exist and we don't
 
04:48:27.890 --> 04:48:27.900 align:start position:0%
think there's a reason to add additional
 
04:48:31.730 --> 04:48:31.740 align:start position:0%
ones there's no blanket policy here that
 
04:48:34.368 --> 04:48:34.378 align:start position:0%
incarcerates people instead judges have
 
04:48:37.070 --> 04:48:37.080 align:start position:0%
broad discretion to consider the facts
 
04:48:39.590 --> 04:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
of the case what the victim wants what
 
04:48:41.270 --> 04:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
the state recommends what the defense
 
04:48:44.150 --> 04:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
wants the defendant's background all
 
04:48:45.650 --> 04:48:45.660 align:start position:0%
those things go into it and then the
 
04:48:50.150 --> 04:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
judge applies the law in the case
 
04:48:51.470 --> 04:48:51.480 align:start position:0%
something that's important to remember
 
04:48:53.990 --> 04:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
here is that I think this was said that
 
04:48:55.190 --> 04:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
you know the average person New
 
04:48:57.110 --> 04:48:57.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire unless they commit a really
 
04:48:58.550 --> 04:48:58.560 align:start position:0%
horrific crime right out of the gate
 
04:48:59.990 --> 04:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
they're not getting a seven and a half
 
04:49:01.610 --> 04:49:01.620 align:start position:0%
year prison sentence out of the gate
 
04:49:03.650 --> 04:49:03.660 align:start position:0%
that person may very well be a repeat
 
04:49:04.970 --> 04:49:04.980 align:start position:0%
offender and this bill would not take
 
04:49:06.410 --> 04:49:06.420 align:start position:0%
that into account
 
04:49:08.030 --> 04:49:08.040 align:start position:0%
so you may have somebody who's committed
 
04:49:10.368 --> 04:49:10.378 align:start position:0%
multiple offenses and finally a judge
 
04:49:11.810 --> 04:49:11.820 align:start position:0%
says you know what I'm going to give you
 
04:49:13.850 --> 04:49:13.860 align:start position:0%
a 10 to 20 year sentence
 
04:49:15.650 --> 04:49:15.660 align:start position:0%
that person has got to that point
 
04:49:17.330 --> 04:49:17.340 align:start position:0%
because of what they've done in the past
 
04:49:19.128 --> 04:49:19.138 align:start position:0%
and then this bill would essentially
 
04:49:21.830 --> 04:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
just cut that in half
 
04:49:21.840 --> 04:49:26.090 align:start position:0%
just cut that in half
um

04:49:26.090 --> 04:49:26.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:27.890 --> 04:49:27.900 align:start position:0%
there was a statement made about the
 
04:49:30.350 --> 04:49:30.360 align:start position:0%
fact that about this bill addressing
 
04:49:31.970 --> 04:49:31.980 align:start position:0%
violent crimes and that's one of the
 
04:49:33.650 --> 04:49:33.660 align:start position:0%
issues that we see with this bill this
 
04:49:36.230 --> 04:49:36.240 align:start position:0%
bill has a carve out for some violent
 
04:49:36.240 --> 04:49:37.550 align:start position:0%
bill has a carve out for some violent
offenses

04:49:37.550 --> 04:49:37.560 align:start position:0%
offenses
 
04:49:39.288 --> 04:49:39.298 align:start position:0%
in a lot of States when these bills are
 
04:49:42.050 --> 04:49:42.060 align:start position:0%
proposed the idea is we want to we want
 
04:49:43.550 --> 04:49:43.560 align:start position:0%
to free people who have haven't
 
04:49:45.350 --> 04:49:45.360 align:start position:0%
committed violent offenses we want to we
 
04:49:46.970 --> 04:49:46.980 align:start position:0%
want to give the chance for non-violent
 
04:49:49.010 --> 04:49:49.020 align:start position:0%
offenders to get out early
 
04:49:51.288 --> 04:49:51.298 align:start position:0%
this bill does just the opposite because
 
04:49:54.350 --> 04:49:54.360 align:start position:0%
what it does is there's a carve out
 
04:49:56.810 --> 04:49:56.820 align:start position:0%
but the carve out is only for some
 
04:49:59.448 --> 04:49:59.458 align:start position:0%
violent offenders so the bill says you
 
04:50:00.830 --> 04:50:00.840 align:start position:0%
can't you can't get the chance to reduce
 
04:50:02.448 --> 04:50:02.458 align:start position:0%
your sentence but only if you commit
 
04:50:04.610 --> 04:50:04.620 align:start position:0%
certain crimes against victims who are
 
04:50:06.948 --> 04:50:06.958 align:start position:0%
under the age of 18. so if you murder
 
04:50:09.470 --> 04:50:09.480 align:start position:0%
someone who's 18 if you set someone's
 
04:50:11.270 --> 04:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
house on fire if he's 18
 
04:50:13.010 --> 04:50:13.020 align:start position:0%
. if you beat and break the bones of
 
04:50:15.110 --> 04:50:15.120 align:start position:0%
someone who's 18 you get the opportunity
 
04:50:17.208 --> 04:50:17.218 align:start position:0%
to reach your sentence but if that
 
04:50:19.190 --> 04:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
victim is 17 you don't get that
 
04:50:19.200 --> 04:50:20.448 align:start position:0%
victim is 17 you don't get that
opportunity

04:50:20.448 --> 04:50:20.458 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
04:50:22.550 --> 04:50:22.560 align:start position:0%
I believe a private individuals spoke
 
04:50:24.230 --> 04:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
and talked about that issue and we agree
 
04:50:25.910 --> 04:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
if you if you're going to consider a
 
04:50:27.708 --> 04:50:27.718 align:start position:0%
bill like this what at least makes
 
04:50:30.110 --> 04:50:30.120 align:start position:0%
conceptual sense to say would apply only
 
04:50:33.230 --> 04:50:33.240 align:start position:0%
to non-violent offenders and there would
 
04:50:34.610 --> 04:50:34.620 align:start position:0%
be a way to come up with a list of what
 
04:50:37.070 --> 04:50:37.080 align:start position:0%
those non-violent offenders would be but
 
04:50:38.750 --> 04:50:38.760 align:start position:0%
otherwise the bill creates two separate
 
04:50:40.970 --> 04:50:40.980 align:start position:0%
classes based on the age of the victim
 
04:50:42.890 --> 04:50:42.900 align:start position:0%
and certainly whether you're if you're
 
04:50:45.590 --> 04:50:45.600 align:start position:0%
17 and you get murdered or you're 18 and
 
04:50:47.628 --> 04:50:47.638 align:start position:0%
you get murdered or beaten or anything
 
04:50:49.670 --> 04:50:49.680 align:start position:0%
else that one year doesn't make much of
 
04:50:51.350 --> 04:50:51.360 align:start position:0%
a difference given given what's happened
 
04:50:53.628 --> 04:50:53.638 align:start position:0%
to you so again if you're going to
 
04:50:57.410 --> 04:50:57.420 align:start position:0%
consider making an exclusion based on
 
04:50:59.030 --> 04:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
that we think the exclusion should be
 
04:51:00.830 --> 04:51:00.840 align:start position:0%
for all violent crimes meaning the only
 
04:51:03.590 --> 04:51:03.600 align:start position:0%
non-violent offenders should be eligible
 
04:51:03.600 --> 04:51:05.330 align:start position:0%
non-violent offenders should be eligible
here

04:51:05.330 --> 04:51:05.340 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:51:06.770 --> 04:51:06.780 align:start position:0%
last thing to say is just
 
04:51:06.780 --> 04:51:10.490 align:start position:0%
last thing to say is just
philosophically

04:51:10.490 --> 04:51:10.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:12.770 --> 04:51:12.780 align:start position:0%
doing the right thing after you've
 
04:51:14.868 --> 04:51:14.878 align:start position:0%
committed a crime or horrific crimes
 
04:51:16.550 --> 04:51:16.560 align:start position:0%
series of horrific crimes doesn't make
 
04:51:18.170 --> 04:51:18.180 align:start position:0%
up for what you did to get there in the
 
04:51:20.570 --> 04:51:20.580 align:start position:0%
first place the system does recognize
 
04:51:23.570 --> 04:51:23.580 align:start position:0%
that people can reform can rehabilitate
 
04:51:25.128 --> 04:51:25.138 align:start position:0%
can help themselves and they get
 
04:51:26.930 --> 04:51:26.940 align:start position:0%
benefits from that they get benefits in
 
04:51:29.208 --> 04:51:29.218 align:start position:0%
prison by getting privileges by having
 
04:51:30.708 --> 04:51:30.718 align:start position:0%
the chance to reduce their sentences
 
04:51:33.110 --> 04:51:33.120 align:start position:0%
they get those benefits
 
04:51:34.850 --> 04:51:34.860 align:start position:0%
um but the question is whether or not
 
04:51:36.770 --> 04:51:36.780 align:start position:0%
somebody is going to keep getting
 
04:51:38.930 --> 04:51:38.940 align:start position:0%
multiple benefits time and time again
 
04:51:40.850 --> 04:51:40.860 align:start position:0%
for doing what's expected of all of us
 
04:51:43.190 --> 04:51:43.200 align:start position:0%
which is just obey the rules and don't
 
04:51:45.410 --> 04:51:45.420 align:start position:0%
hurt people and so there's a fundamental
 
04:51:47.090 --> 04:51:47.100 align:start position:0%
issue with this which is to say how many
 
04:51:48.650 --> 04:51:48.660 align:start position:0%
times do you get the benefit of just
 
04:51:50.750 --> 04:51:50.760 align:start position:0%
doing what we ask you to do when the
 
04:51:52.310 --> 04:51:52.320 align:start position:0%
reason you're there is because you did
 
04:51:55.490 --> 04:51:55.500 align:start position:0%
the exact opposite there has to be some
 
04:51:57.890 --> 04:51:57.900 align:start position:0%
have to be some repercussions for that
 
04:51:57.900 --> 04:51:58.970 align:start position:0%
have to be some repercussions for that
conduct

04:51:58.970 --> 04:51:58.980 align:start position:0%
conduct
 
04:52:01.490 --> 04:52:01.500 align:start position:0%
and our system in New Hampshire already
 
04:52:03.350 --> 04:52:03.360 align:start position:0%
recognizes that we will win all that
 
04:52:05.810 --> 04:52:05.820 align:start position:0%
down that it can be reduced but we feel
 
04:52:07.850 --> 04:52:07.860 align:start position:0%
that this bill simply goes too far and
 
04:52:09.650 --> 04:52:09.660 align:start position:0%
should not include violent offenders at
 
04:52:11.690 --> 04:52:11.700 align:start position:0%
the lease and I'll turn to attorney
 
04:52:12.948 --> 04:52:12.958 align:start position:0%
Andress and see if he wants to add
 
04:52:13.930 --> 04:52:13.940 align:start position:0%
things and then we'll have to thank you
 
04:52:16.788 --> 04:52:16.798 align:start position:0%
the only thing I would add is as
 
04:52:18.288 --> 04:52:18.298 align:start position:0%
attorney strolls and said judges have
 
04:52:20.570 --> 04:52:20.580 align:start position:0%
wide discretion in sentencing
 
04:52:22.788 --> 04:52:22.798 align:start position:0%
what doesn't make sense to me in this is
 
04:52:25.070 --> 04:52:25.080 align:start position:0%
that the minimum has to be seven and a
 
04:52:26.570 --> 04:52:26.580 align:start position:0%
half years in order for this bill to
 
04:52:26.580 --> 04:52:27.590 align:start position:0%
half years in order for this bill to
apply

04:52:27.590 --> 04:52:27.600 align:start position:0%
apply
 
04:52:30.110 --> 04:52:30.120 align:start position:0%
so if a person was sentenced to 5 to 15
 
04:52:31.730 --> 04:52:31.740 align:start position:0%
years in the New Hampshire State Prison
 
04:52:34.070 --> 04:52:34.080 align:start position:0%
they would be eligible for parole after
 
04:52:36.470 --> 04:52:36.480 align:start position:0%
they served their minimum five years but
 
04:52:38.270 --> 04:52:38.280 align:start position:0%
if a person was sentenced to seven and a
 
04:52:39.650 --> 04:52:39.660 align:start position:0%
half to 15 years in the New Hampshire
 
04:52:41.868 --> 04:52:41.878 align:start position:0%
State Prison under this bill they'd be
 
04:52:44.390 --> 04:52:44.400 align:start position:0%
eligible to apply for parole after three
 
04:52:46.070 --> 04:52:46.080 align:start position:0%
and three quarter years
 
04:52:48.708 --> 04:52:48.718 align:start position:0%
so you'd end up in a situation where
 
04:52:51.110 --> 04:52:51.120 align:start position:0%
if you were serving less than seven and
 
04:52:53.510 --> 04:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
a half years as your minimum you had
 
04:52:55.788 --> 04:52:55.798 align:start position:0%
essentially truth in sentencing but over
 
04:52:57.830 --> 04:52:57.840 align:start position:0%
seven and a half years it was really it
 
04:53:00.410 --> 04:53:00.420 align:start position:0%
was half that and certainly judges would
 
04:53:02.628 --> 04:53:02.638 align:start position:0%
understand that and the difficulty is if
 
04:53:04.190 --> 04:53:04.200 align:start position:0%
a judge felt that someone should spend
 
04:53:07.550 --> 04:53:07.560 align:start position:0%
10 years in prison instead of doing for
 
04:53:09.530 --> 04:53:09.540 align:start position:0%
example a 10 to 20 where the judge knows
 
04:53:10.850 --> 04:53:10.860 align:start position:0%
the person would be eligible for parole
 
04:53:12.890 --> 04:53:12.900 align:start position:0%
after five years you may have judges
 
04:53:16.090 --> 04:53:16.100 align:start position:0%
imposing a 20 to 40 sentence
 
04:53:19.010 --> 04:53:19.020 align:start position:0%
so that the person did actually spend 10
 
04:53:20.990 --> 04:53:21.000 align:start position:0%
years incarcerated
 
04:53:23.090 --> 04:53:23.100 align:start position:0%
that's really all I had
 
04:53:27.530 --> 04:53:27.540 align:start position:0%
to anybody has any questions yeah I a
 
04:53:29.990 --> 04:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
couple quick points you mentioned the
 
04:53:32.570 --> 04:53:32.580 align:start position:0%
sentence review board and you said that
 
04:53:35.868 --> 04:53:35.878 align:start position:0%
they could increase so if a defendant
 
04:53:38.628 --> 04:53:38.638 align:start position:0%
has found himself guilty and they got a
 
04:53:40.010 --> 04:53:40.020 align:start position:0%
sentence that they think was a little
 
04:53:43.368 --> 04:53:43.378 align:start position:0%
too harsh and they apply to this they're
 
04:53:44.628 --> 04:53:44.638 align:start position:0%
kind of is are they are they really
 
04:53:46.070 --> 04:53:46.080 align:start position:0%
rolling the dice they could end up with
 
04:53:47.810 --> 04:53:47.820 align:start position:0%
a harsher sentence because they asked
 
04:53:49.610 --> 04:53:49.620 align:start position:0%
that so the Central View Board can do
 
04:53:50.930 --> 04:53:50.940 align:start position:0%
three things they can maintain the
 
04:53:52.788 --> 04:53:52.798 align:start position:0%
sentence they can reduce it or increase
 
04:53:54.530 --> 04:53:54.540 align:start position:0%
it and you can look at their statistics
 
04:53:58.490 --> 04:53:58.500 align:start position:0%
I think 98 plus they leave they
 
04:54:01.070 --> 04:54:01.080 align:start position:0%
sometimes reduce and rarely do they
 
04:54:03.288 --> 04:54:03.298 align:start position:0%
increase so the vast majority of the
 
04:54:05.030 --> 04:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
time it's probably staying in the same
 
04:54:06.530 --> 04:54:06.540 align:start position:0%
range of reducing but yeah there's
 
04:54:09.530 --> 04:54:09.540 align:start position:0%
there's a risk with that which is that
 
04:54:12.788 --> 04:54:12.798 align:start position:0%
it certainly could be increased
 
04:54:15.470 --> 04:54:15.480 align:start position:0%
in my my last question
 
04:54:17.030 --> 04:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
um when you were talking about the
 
04:54:19.730 --> 04:54:19.740 align:start position:0%
different ways that someone is there's
 
04:54:21.708 --> 04:54:21.718 align:start position:0%
also uh correct me if I'm wrong the
 
04:54:24.230 --> 04:54:24.240 align:start position:0%
potential for asking for a clemency or
 
04:54:27.650 --> 04:54:27.660 align:start position:0%
pardon from the the executives that also
 
04:54:29.448 --> 04:54:29.458 align:start position:0%
so the way it works in New Hampshire uh
 
04:54:31.310 --> 04:54:31.320 align:start position:0%
there's a governance constitutional
 
04:54:33.650 --> 04:54:33.660 align:start position:0%
right to Grant a pardon but also
 
04:54:36.708 --> 04:54:36.718 align:start position:0%
clemency or a sentence reduction those
 
04:54:39.288 --> 04:54:39.298 align:start position:0%
are rare but they sometimes happen but I
 
04:54:42.550 --> 04:54:42.560 align:start position:0%
would say my experience pretty rare
 
04:54:44.510 --> 04:54:44.520 align:start position:0%
representative Rhodes
 
04:54:46.430 --> 04:54:46.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
04:54:48.350 --> 04:54:48.360 align:start position:0%
taking my question and Mr chairman if I
 
04:54:49.430 --> 04:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
may just have a second because I have to
 
04:54:51.230 --> 04:54:51.240 align:start position:0%
frame this I apologize
 
04:54:53.208 --> 04:54:53.218 align:start position:0%
last week we heard
 
04:54:55.430 --> 04:54:55.440 align:start position:0%
we heard a bill and
 
04:54:57.230 --> 04:54:57.240 align:start position:0%
um your your friend was testifying and
 
04:54:58.730 --> 04:54:58.740 align:start position:0%
gave us some examples of some things
 
04:55:01.550 --> 04:55:01.560 align:start position:0%
that may not be considered violent and a
 
04:55:02.750 --> 04:55:02.760 align:start position:0%
lot of people in the committee were like
 
04:55:04.788 --> 04:55:04.798 align:start position:0%
what right so he'd mentioned arson may
 
04:55:06.230 --> 04:55:06.240 align:start position:0%
not be considered violated kidnapping
 
04:55:08.090 --> 04:55:08.100 align:start position:0%
may not be considered violent I took
 
04:55:09.470 --> 04:55:09.480 align:start position:0%
that as if
 
04:55:12.110 --> 04:55:12.120 align:start position:0%
a parent maybe doesn't have custody of
 
04:55:13.310 --> 04:55:13.320 align:start position:0%
their kid and they kidnap them that
 
04:55:15.110 --> 04:55:15.120 align:start position:0%
might not be considered violent and the
 
04:55:17.448 --> 04:55:17.458 align:start position:0%
other thing with arson is
 
04:55:19.550 --> 04:55:19.560 align:start position:0%
I guess it could be a discretionary
 
04:55:21.530 --> 04:55:21.540 align:start position:0%
maybe the building was vacant and that
 
04:55:22.910 --> 04:55:22.920 align:start position:0%
would be a reason it would not be
 
04:55:25.730 --> 04:55:25.740 align:start position:0%
considered vacant I mean violent so with
 
04:55:27.850 --> 04:55:27.860 align:start position:0%
with that being said my question is
 
04:55:30.350 --> 04:55:30.360 align:start position:0%
you're mentioning about
 
04:55:32.390 --> 04:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
you know violent crimes maybe that not
 
04:55:35.208 --> 04:55:35.218 align:start position:0%
being considered so would that mean that
 
04:55:37.550 --> 04:55:37.560 align:start position:0%
violent crimes May
 
04:55:41.350 --> 04:55:41.360 align:start position:0%
be discretionary or or judgmental or
 
04:55:43.550 --> 04:55:43.560 align:start position:0%
just you don't understand my question I
 
04:55:45.650 --> 04:55:45.660 align:start position:0%
do thank you so you heard me mention our
 
04:55:47.868 --> 04:55:47.878 align:start position:0%
sin and other crimes the bill has a
 
04:55:50.270 --> 04:55:50.280 align:start position:0%
definition of what violent crimes means
 
04:55:53.030 --> 04:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
but that that is too limited in our view
 
04:55:56.150 --> 04:55:56.160 align:start position:0%
so if we if you're going to revise this
 
04:55:57.948 --> 04:55:57.958 align:start position:0%
bill the suggestion would be that you
 
04:56:00.550 --> 04:56:00.560 align:start position:0%
actually include things like arson
 
04:56:03.890 --> 04:56:03.900 align:start position:0%
second-degree assault major drug dealing
 
04:56:05.448 --> 04:56:05.458 align:start position:0%
case especially drug cases that result
 
04:56:08.570 --> 04:56:08.580 align:start position:0%
in deaths because for example as a
 
04:56:10.730 --> 04:56:10.740 align:start position:0%
prosecutor arson I've argued look maybe
 
04:56:12.110 --> 04:56:12.120 align:start position:0%
there was nobody in the building but you
 
04:56:14.270 --> 04:56:14.280 align:start position:0%
put the firefighters at risk who are
 
04:56:16.430 --> 04:56:16.440 align:start position:0%
going there to put out that fire so I
 
04:56:17.810 --> 04:56:17.820 align:start position:0%
agree with you there is there are a
 
04:56:20.208 --> 04:56:20.218 align:start position:0%
class of other serious offenses that
 
04:56:21.948 --> 04:56:21.958 align:start position:0%
should be included in that list of
 
04:56:23.750 --> 04:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
violent offenses
 
04:56:26.868 --> 04:56:26.878 align:start position:0%
um again if if the idea is to give the
 
04:56:28.190 --> 04:56:28.200 align:start position:0%
most deserving people a chance
 
04:56:29.868 --> 04:56:29.878 align:start position:0%
potentially reducing their sentence you
 
04:56:31.128 --> 04:56:31.138 align:start position:0%
would seem to want to include
 
04:56:32.930 --> 04:56:32.940 align:start position:0%
non-violent offenders in that group only
 
04:56:35.930 --> 04:56:35.940 align:start position:0%
but again the legislature could craft a
 
04:56:38.990 --> 04:56:39.000 align:start position:0%
definition of violent offenses and and
 
04:56:40.970 --> 04:56:40.980 align:start position:0%
add or remove whatever they saw fit in
 
04:56:42.650 --> 04:56:42.660 align:start position:0%
that definition
 
04:56:45.250 --> 04:56:45.260 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
04:56:47.868 --> 04:56:47.878 align:start position:0%
represent Zimmer
 
04:56:49.610 --> 04:56:49.620 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question thank
 
04:56:51.350 --> 04:56:51.360 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um I was just wondering
 
04:56:53.690 --> 04:56:53.700 align:start position:0%
since you said that the sentence review
 
04:56:56.628 --> 04:56:56.638 align:start position:0%
board 98 of the time keeps the sentence
 
04:56:58.910 --> 04:56:58.920 align:start position:0%
the same is that actually an effective
 
04:57:00.948 --> 04:57:00.958 align:start position:0%
way that we currently have available to
 
04:57:03.890 --> 04:57:03.900 align:start position:0%
us to reduce sentences for offenders
 
04:57:05.930 --> 04:57:05.940 align:start position:0%
it is effective because if the goal is
 
04:57:07.430 --> 04:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
to check and see whether judges are
 
04:57:08.930 --> 04:57:08.940 align:start position:0%
making the right decision that tells you
 
04:57:10.910 --> 04:57:10.920 align:start position:0%
that three other people reviewed that
 
04:57:12.530 --> 04:57:12.540 align:start position:0%
sentence and found that the judge did in
 
04:57:14.390 --> 04:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
fact make the correct decision because
 
04:57:16.070 --> 04:57:16.080 align:start position:0%
the idea of that sense review board is
 
04:57:17.628 --> 04:57:17.638 align:start position:0%
to correct what they see as
 
04:57:20.090 --> 04:57:20.100 align:start position:0%
inappropriate decisions so I think you
 
04:57:21.708 --> 04:57:21.718 align:start position:0%
should be heartened by the fact that
 
04:57:24.350 --> 04:57:24.360 align:start position:0%
three completely independent experienced
 
04:57:26.390 --> 04:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
judges looked at all the facts of the
 
04:57:28.250 --> 04:57:28.260 align:start position:0%
case and said you know what we think the
 
04:57:29.868 --> 04:57:29.878 align:start position:0%
Judge made the appropriate decision here
 
04:57:31.788 --> 04:57:31.798 align:start position:0%
so I think again what that affirms is
 
04:57:34.010 --> 04:57:34.020 align:start position:0%
that our current system is working
 
04:57:36.170 --> 04:57:36.180 align:start position:0%
extremely well in New Hampshire I think
 
04:57:38.270 --> 04:57:38.280 align:start position:0%
if you saw if the number was 98 were
 
04:57:40.070 --> 04:57:40.080 align:start position:0%
corrected I think that we would be
 
04:57:41.750 --> 04:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
concerned about the fact that our system
 
04:57:43.250 --> 04:57:43.260 align:start position:0%
isn't working appropriately so again
 
04:57:45.410 --> 04:57:45.420 align:start position:0%
this is actually a check that confirms
 
04:57:47.030 --> 04:57:47.040 align:start position:0%
that judges are actually getting it
 
04:57:47.040 --> 04:57:49.250 align:start position:0%
that judges are actually getting it
right

04:57:49.250 --> 04:57:49.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:52.190 --> 04:57:52.200 align:start position:0%
representative Newell
 
04:57:53.750 --> 04:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
04:57:55.190 --> 04:57:55.200 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:57:57.770 --> 04:57:57.780 align:start position:0%
um I was actually uh reached out to by a
 
04:57:59.510 --> 04:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
constituent so I feel like I have a
 
04:58:00.770 --> 04:58:00.780 align:start position:0%
little bit of a responsibility to ask
 
04:58:02.150 --> 04:58:02.160 align:start position:0%
about this as somebody who's been
 
04:58:04.730 --> 04:58:04.740 align:start position:0%
following this for I think they said it
 
04:58:06.770 --> 04:58:06.780 align:start position:0%
was through for three years that this
 
04:58:08.510 --> 04:58:08.520 align:start position:0%
has been coming up every year um and
 
04:58:09.948 --> 04:58:09.958 align:start position:0%
last year it came within two votes I
 
04:58:09.958 --> 04:58:11.090 align:start position:0%
last year it came within two votes I
believe

04:58:11.090 --> 04:58:11.100 align:start position:0%
believe
 
04:58:13.670 --> 04:58:13.680 align:start position:0%
um my question is is that the way it was
 
04:58:15.830 --> 04:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
presented to me the last two years the
 
04:58:18.230 --> 04:58:18.240 align:start position:0%
AG hasn't taken a position on it and
 
04:58:20.810 --> 04:58:20.820 align:start position:0%
this year have chosen to oppose it and
 
04:58:22.250 --> 04:58:22.260 align:start position:0%
so I'm just wondering what's the
 
04:58:24.530 --> 04:58:24.540 align:start position:0%
difference between the last two years
 
04:58:27.650 --> 04:58:27.660 align:start position:0%
and in this year what what prompted uh
 
04:58:29.930 --> 04:58:29.940 align:start position:0%
you to take a position on this this year
 
04:58:33.470 --> 04:58:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:36.170 --> 04:58:36.180 align:start position:0%
well easy enough thank you there's
 
04:58:37.788 --> 04:58:37.798 align:start position:0%
sometimes there's sometimes a change in
 
04:58:39.350 --> 04:58:39.360 align:start position:0%
philosophy about
 
04:58:40.930 --> 04:58:40.940 align:start position:0%
um our role
 
04:58:43.788 --> 04:58:43.798 align:start position:0%
last year we were we we were approached
 
04:58:45.110 --> 04:58:45.120 align:start position:0%
and said hey it would be helpful to have
 
04:58:46.550 --> 04:58:46.560 align:start position:0%
you at least come over and answer
 
04:58:48.530 --> 04:58:48.540 align:start position:0%
questions about bills
 
04:58:49.850 --> 04:58:49.860 align:start position:0%
um and so you know we try to we try to
 
04:58:52.190 --> 04:58:52.200 align:start position:0%
be careful about our role uh and then
 
04:58:54.350 --> 04:58:54.360 align:start position:0%
I've been in the office 22 plus years
 
04:58:55.850 --> 04:58:55.860 align:start position:0%
there have been times I've come over in
 
04:58:58.788 --> 04:58:58.798 align:start position:0%
the past other times you know not
 
04:59:00.350 --> 04:59:00.360 align:start position:0%
um but we've
 
04:59:02.570 --> 04:59:02.580 align:start position:0%
we've definitely tried to monitor bills
 
04:59:04.430 --> 04:59:04.440 align:start position:0%
and pick the bills that we think really
 
04:59:06.530 --> 04:59:06.540 align:start position:0%
impact Justice on a Statewide basis in
 
04:59:07.788 --> 04:59:07.798 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and also try to figure out
 
04:59:09.410 --> 04:59:09.420 align:start position:0%
can we at least come over we're not
 
04:59:10.788 --> 04:59:10.798 align:start position:0%
going to take a position and at least
 
04:59:12.350 --> 04:59:12.360 align:start position:0%
answer your questions and be as helpful
 
04:59:14.030 --> 04:59:14.040 align:start position:0%
as we can whatever our opinion is and
 
04:59:15.288 --> 04:59:15.298 align:start position:0%
we'll do that on some bills as well
 
04:59:16.610 --> 04:59:16.620 align:start position:0%
where we say we're not taking a position
 
04:59:18.288 --> 04:59:18.298 align:start position:0%
we're just happy to provide whatever
 
04:59:20.110 --> 04:59:20.120 align:start position:0%
information you can
 
04:59:22.610 --> 04:59:22.620 align:start position:0%
and we've also reached out to the other
 
04:59:25.190 --> 04:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
County attorneys and I can indicate the
 
04:59:26.690 --> 04:59:26.700 align:start position:0%
Merrimack County attorney Halverson
 
04:59:28.190 --> 04:59:28.200 align:start position:0%
opposes the bill Cheshire county
 
04:59:30.530 --> 04:59:30.540 align:start position:0%
attorney McLaughlin opposes the Bill
 
04:59:32.990 --> 04:59:33.000 align:start position:0%
Carroll County attorney andrewsy opposes
 
04:59:34.310 --> 04:59:34.320 align:start position:0%
the bill of kawas County attorney
 
04:59:36.650 --> 04:59:36.660 align:start position:0%
McCormick opposes the bill Belknap
 
04:59:39.110 --> 04:59:39.120 align:start position:0%
County attorney Livernois poses the bill
 
04:59:40.670 --> 04:59:40.680 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County attorney Conway
 
04:59:42.590 --> 04:59:42.600 align:start position:0%
opposed it and Grafton the County
 
04:59:44.868 --> 04:59:44.878 align:start position:0%
Attorney Marshall Hornick also indicated
 
04:59:49.310 --> 04:59:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:57.708 --> 04:59:57.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:57.718 --> 04:59:58.788 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:59:58.788 --> 04:59:58.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:00:01.430 --> 05:00:01.440 align:start position:0%
I thought and I may have misheard you
 
05:00:03.288 --> 05:00:03.298 align:start position:0%
may say something about
 
05:00:03.298 --> 05:00:03.890 align:start position:0%
may say something about
um

05:00:03.890 --> 05:00:03.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:00:07.010 --> 05:00:07.020 align:start position:0%
this bill cuts the sentence in half but
 
05:00:10.010 --> 05:00:10.020 align:start position:0%
the wording as I read it is that it
 
05:00:11.990 --> 05:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't cut anything it really only
 
05:00:15.050 --> 05:00:15.060 align:start position:0%
gives you the right to apply for parole
 
05:00:17.390 --> 05:00:17.400 align:start position:0%
and the parole can make a decision to
 
05:00:19.788 --> 05:00:19.798 align:start position:0%
Grant a parole right away or it can deny
 
05:00:21.230 --> 05:00:21.240 align:start position:0%
the parole and it so it doesn't really
 
05:00:23.810 --> 05:00:23.820 align:start position:0%
cut it in half it just has to do with
 
05:00:25.610 --> 05:00:25.620 align:start position:0%
the application when the application for
 
05:00:27.948 --> 05:00:27.958 align:start position:0%
parole can be made is that am I wrong
 
05:00:30.410 --> 05:00:30.420 align:start position:0%
and understanding it that way
 
05:00:30.420 --> 05:00:31.550 align:start position:0%
and understanding it that way
no

05:00:31.550 --> 05:00:31.560 align:start position:0%
no
 
05:00:33.830 --> 05:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
I mean I think that's a that's a fair
 
05:00:35.510 --> 05:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
assessment of it it allows you to apply
 
05:00:37.070 --> 05:00:37.080 align:start position:0%
for parole
 
05:00:38.868 --> 05:00:38.878 align:start position:0%
um in half the time that it would
 
05:00:41.208 --> 05:00:41.218 align:start position:0%
normally take you to apply for parole if
 
05:00:42.890 --> 05:00:42.900 align:start position:0%
your minimum sentence was seven and a
 
05:00:46.550 --> 05:00:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:46.560 --> 05:00:48.530 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

05:00:48.530 --> 05:00:48.540 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
05:00:48.540 --> 05:00:50.090 align:start position:0%
follow-up
so

05:00:50.090 --> 05:00:50.100 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:00:52.310 --> 05:00:52.320 align:start position:0%
does it allow you in half the time or is
 
05:00:54.230 --> 05:00:54.240 align:start position:0%
it to allow you just in half the time or
 
05:00:56.150 --> 05:00:56.160 align:start position:0%
whatever the minimum sentence is maybe I
 
05:01:00.230 --> 05:01:00.240 align:start position:0%
don't understand so normally under the
 
05:01:02.270 --> 05:01:02.280 align:start position:0%
system now if you're sentenced to seven
 
05:01:04.910 --> 05:01:04.920 align:start position:0%
and a half to 15 years you can apply for
 
05:01:07.128 --> 05:01:07.138 align:start position:0%
parole after seven and a half years
 
05:01:09.530 --> 05:01:09.540 align:start position:0%
under this bill if you were sentenced to
 
05:01:11.150 --> 05:01:11.160 align:start position:0%
seven and a half to 15 years you could
 
05:01:13.310 --> 05:01:13.320 align:start position:0%
apply for parole in three and three
 
05:01:15.110 --> 05:01:15.120 align:start position:0%
quarter years which is half of seven and
 
05:01:16.010 --> 05:01:16.020 align:start position:0%
a half
 
05:01:17.930 --> 05:01:17.940 align:start position:0%
but if you had a minimum sentence of
 
05:01:19.970 --> 05:01:19.980 align:start position:0%
less than seven and a half this wouldn't
 
05:01:22.310 --> 05:01:22.320 align:start position:0%
necessarily affect you so if you had a
 
05:01:26.690 --> 05:01:26.700 align:start position:0%
minimum of say five to fifty a cents of
 
05:01:28.970 --> 05:01:28.980 align:start position:0%
five to Fifteen you'd have to wait the
 
05:01:31.670 --> 05:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
full five years to apply for parole
 
05:01:33.230 --> 05:01:33.240 align:start position:0%
so you'd actually have this scenario
 
05:01:36.050 --> 05:01:36.060 align:start position:0%
where if you had a five to Fifteen
 
05:01:37.730 --> 05:01:37.740 align:start position:0%
it would take you you'd have to wait
 
05:01:39.288 --> 05:01:39.298 align:start position:0%
five years to apply for parole but if
 
05:01:40.850 --> 05:01:40.860 align:start position:0%
you had a seven and a half to Fifteen
 
05:01:43.128 --> 05:01:43.138 align:start position:0%
you could apply for parole in three and
 
05:01:44.510 --> 05:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
three quarter years
 
05:01:46.070 --> 05:01:46.080 align:start position:0%
you actually have the ability to get
 
05:01:48.288 --> 05:01:48.298 align:start position:0%
approached sooner Mr chair could I ask
 
05:01:49.910 --> 05:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
to quick while and follow up on the same
 
05:01:49.920 --> 05:01:53.090 align:start position:0%
to quick while and follow up on the same
subject

05:01:53.090 --> 05:01:53.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:55.310 --> 05:01:55.320 align:start position:0%
so on the same surgery let's just go up
 
05:01:56.868 --> 05:01:56.878 align:start position:0%
to the I'm a little bit confused about
 
05:01:59.030 --> 05:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
what the what the maximum sentences are
 
05:02:01.070 --> 05:02:01.080 align:start position:0%
I've heard they could increase it to 10
 
05:02:04.010 --> 05:02:04.020 align:start position:0%
to 40 or 10 to whatever and and my
 
05:02:05.930 --> 05:02:05.940 align:start position:0%
question is is that just at the
 
05:02:08.030 --> 05:02:08.040 align:start position:0%
discretion of the judge or is there
 
05:02:09.410 --> 05:02:09.420 align:start position:0%
something that
 
05:02:12.050 --> 05:02:12.060 align:start position:0%
that the maximum may not be the maximum
 
05:02:14.690 --> 05:02:14.700 align:start position:0%
as defined for a specific crime it
 
05:02:16.430 --> 05:02:16.440 align:start position:0%
depends on the particular crime some
 
05:02:18.530 --> 05:02:18.540 align:start position:0%
some statutes set a maximum for instance
 
05:02:20.810 --> 05:02:20.820 align:start position:0%
homicide cases it may be a maximum of
 
05:02:23.990 --> 05:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
life for class B felonies the maximum is
 
05:02:25.670 --> 05:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
three and a half to seven years class A
 
05:02:28.128 --> 05:02:28.138 align:start position:0%
felonies seven and a half to 15 years so
 
05:02:29.990 --> 05:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
the particular law May establish what
 
05:02:32.150 --> 05:02:32.160 align:start position:0%
the actual maximum is in the judge can't
 
05:02:33.350 --> 05:02:33.360 align:start position:0%
exceed that
 
05:02:35.868 --> 05:02:35.878 align:start position:0%
and that's similar to the to the minimum
 
05:02:37.670 --> 05:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
can also be in the law and that is
 
05:02:39.830 --> 05:02:39.840 align:start position:0%
that's a hard those two would be hard
 
05:02:41.810 --> 05:02:41.820 align:start position:0%
maximum and minimum yeah it just sets a
 
05:02:43.490 --> 05:02:43.500 align:start position:0%
minimum and a maximum but again very
 
05:02:45.288 --> 05:02:45.298 align:start position:0%
very few crimes in New Hampshire to have
 
05:02:46.970 --> 05:02:46.980 align:start position:0%
a mandatory minimum so a judge can go
 
05:02:49.610 --> 05:02:49.620 align:start position:0%
anywhere from zero up to the maximum on
 
05:02:53.930 --> 05:02:53.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:55.550 --> 05:02:55.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
05:02:56.570 --> 05:02:56.580 align:start position:0%
for listening we appreciate the
 
05:03:00.530 --> 05:03:00.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:02.030 --> 05:03:02.040 align:start position:0%
thank you the chair recognizes Jay
 
05:03:06.948 --> 05:03:06.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:06.958 --> 05:03:28.070 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

05:03:28.070 --> 05:03:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:31.490 --> 05:03:31.500 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I'm Roger Phillipson
 
05:03:34.550 --> 05:03:34.560 align:start position:0%
um chairman of the Adult Parole Board
 
05:03:37.910 --> 05:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
um but J Mack Eaton uh is our director
 
05:03:41.090 --> 05:03:41.100 align:start position:0%
of operations but he also has a
 
05:03:41.100 --> 05:03:42.070 align:start position:0%
of operations but he also has a
background

05:03:42.070 --> 05:03:42.080 align:start position:0%
background
 
05:03:42.080 --> 05:03:43.750 align:start position:0%
background
in

05:03:43.750 --> 05:03:43.760 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:03:47.868 --> 05:03:47.878 align:start position:0%
working at at the prison in
 
05:03:49.850 --> 05:03:49.860 align:start position:0%
classifications which is extremely
 
05:03:53.330 --> 05:03:53.340 align:start position:0%
important and I think he has a number of
 
05:03:55.250 --> 05:03:55.260 align:start position:0%
things to say and I will turn it over to
 
05:03:58.070 --> 05:03:58.080 align:start position:0%
him I think would be a big help to the
 
05:03:58.080 --> 05:04:00.490 align:start position:0%
him I think would be a big help to the
committee

05:04:00.490 --> 05:04:00.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:02.690 --> 05:04:02.700 align:start position:0%
good afternoon chairman members of the
 
05:04:04.310 --> 05:04:04.320 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for allowing me to
 
05:04:06.470 --> 05:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
provide some testimony I said my name is
 
05:04:07.610 --> 05:04:07.620 align:start position:0%
Jay Mackey I'm the director of
 
05:04:08.868 --> 05:04:08.878 align:start position:0%
operations for the New Hampshire Del
 
05:04:11.330 --> 05:04:11.340 align:start position:0%
parole board I have been in the field of
 
05:04:12.350 --> 05:04:12.360 align:start position:0%
Corrections for a little bit of
 
05:04:15.470 --> 05:04:15.480 align:start position:0%
background for 24 years now I started as
 
05:04:16.910 --> 05:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
a corrections officer field training
 
05:04:19.670 --> 05:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
officer cert team member defensive
 
05:04:21.590 --> 05:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
tactics instructor youth counselor and
 
05:04:23.930 --> 05:04:23.940 align:start position:0%
Juvenile Justice to being over at the
 
05:04:26.330 --> 05:04:26.340 align:start position:0%
prison as a case manager and civilian at
 
05:04:29.390 --> 05:04:29.400 align:start position:0%
civilian duty to working as a supervisor
 
05:04:30.650 --> 05:04:30.660 align:start position:0%
of federal records and administrative
 
05:04:32.990 --> 05:04:33.000 align:start position:0%
classification so uh first half of my
 
05:04:34.910 --> 05:04:34.920 align:start position:0%
career is based on
 
05:04:37.730 --> 05:04:37.740 align:start position:0%
providing security for the staff and the
 
05:04:39.708 --> 05:04:39.718 align:start position:0%
inmates and and the community and
 
05:04:41.510 --> 05:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
keeping people incarcerated the second
 
05:04:44.628 --> 05:04:44.638 align:start position:0%
half was more of working with the
 
05:04:47.090 --> 05:04:47.100 align:start position:0%
inmates to try to get them released and
 
05:04:48.590 --> 05:04:48.600 align:start position:0%
working to make sure that they are fit
 
05:04:50.150 --> 05:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
to be released so I've seen Corrections
 
05:04:52.010 --> 05:04:52.020 align:start position:0%
from all angles
 
05:04:54.350 --> 05:04:54.360 align:start position:0%
um of the spectrum
 
05:04:54.360 --> 05:04:55.070 align:start position:0%
um of the spectrum
um

05:04:55.070 --> 05:04:55.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:04:56.868 --> 05:04:56.878 align:start position:0%
I've submitted some written testimony I
 
05:04:58.730 --> 05:04:58.740 align:start position:0%
won't go through all three pages but
 
05:05:00.770 --> 05:05:00.780 align:start position:0%
I'll try to Briefly summarize a lot of
 
05:05:00.780 --> 05:05:01.788 align:start position:0%
I'll try to Briefly summarize a lot of
it

05:05:01.788 --> 05:05:01.798 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:05:01.798 --> 05:05:03.230 align:start position:0%
it
um

05:05:03.230 --> 05:05:03.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:05:05.690 --> 05:05:05.700 align:start position:0%
I know we testified earlier about you
 
05:05:06.890 --> 05:05:06.900 align:start position:0%
know the operations of the New Hampshire
 
05:05:08.868 --> 05:05:08.878 align:start position:0%
Del parole board this bill as written
 
05:05:11.030 --> 05:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
may not have a significant impact on us
 
05:05:13.550 --> 05:05:13.560 align:start position:0%
but if there are any amendments made it
 
05:05:16.610 --> 05:05:16.620 align:start position:0%
could result in US needing to have more
 
05:05:18.948 --> 05:05:18.958 align:start position:0%
hearings more staff to provide for the
 
05:05:21.890 --> 05:05:21.900 align:start position:0%
increased workload and even increase the
 
05:05:24.430 --> 05:05:24.440 align:start position:0%
membership to more than five members
 
05:05:27.410 --> 05:05:27.420 align:start position:0%
depending upon if any of this criteria
 
05:05:30.170 --> 05:05:30.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:33.110 --> 05:05:33.120 align:start position:0%
I I was here on behalf of the doc in
 
05:05:35.570 --> 05:05:35.580 align:start position:0%
2021 when this bill was first introduced
 
05:05:37.430 --> 05:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
there were no amendments to it it was
 
05:05:41.390 --> 05:05:41.400 align:start position:0%
just you know eligible approve at 50 it
 
05:05:43.788 --> 05:05:43.798 align:start position:0%
was opposed by the doc at the time I was
 
05:05:46.070 --> 05:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
here last year with former chairperson
 
05:05:47.690 --> 05:05:47.700 align:start position:0%
Jennifer Sergeant on behalf of the
 
05:05:49.190 --> 05:05:49.200 align:start position:0%
parole board when the amendments were
 
05:05:52.190 --> 05:05:52.200 align:start position:0%
made with all this criteria in there and
 
05:05:53.990 --> 05:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
we opposed it back then as well based
 
05:05:56.030 --> 05:05:56.040 align:start position:0%
off of the The increased workload and
 
05:05:58.910 --> 05:05:58.920 align:start position:0%
and all that other type of issues that
 
05:06:00.470 --> 05:06:00.480 align:start position:0%
are documented in this this written
 
05:06:00.480 --> 05:06:01.910 align:start position:0%
are documented in this this written
testimony

05:06:01.910 --> 05:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
05:06:01.920 --> 05:06:03.050 align:start position:0%
testimony
um

05:06:03.050 --> 05:06:03.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:06:05.750 --> 05:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
excuse me as has been stated multiple
 
05:06:08.390 --> 05:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
times by multiple people uh there is
 
05:06:11.208 --> 05:06:11.218 align:start position:0%
already in place
 
05:06:13.910 --> 05:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
um processes and procedures for mh2 be
 
05:06:16.190 --> 05:06:16.200 align:start position:0%
able to reduce their sentences as has
 
05:06:19.490 --> 05:06:19.500 align:start position:0%
been said at RSA 65120 the amendment was
 
05:06:20.930 --> 05:06:20.940 align:start position:0%
made I believe last year where the
 
05:06:22.550 --> 05:06:22.560 align:start position:0%
inmates could actually apply up to a
 
05:06:25.250 --> 05:06:25.260 align:start position:0%
year before their two-thirds date which
 
05:06:28.010 --> 05:06:28.020 align:start position:0%
would allow them if granted they could
 
05:06:29.390 --> 05:06:29.400 align:start position:0%
start working on their re-entry
 
05:06:31.070 --> 05:06:31.080 align:start position:0%
programming and all that type of stuff
 
05:06:33.110 --> 05:06:33.120 align:start position:0%
which is was a very good idea I believe
 
05:06:34.730 --> 05:06:34.740 align:start position:0%
as a doc we supported it when it was
 
05:06:36.230 --> 05:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
first introduced
 
05:06:36.240 --> 05:06:38.208 align:start position:0%
first introduced
um

05:06:38.208 --> 05:06:38.218 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:06:41.208 --> 05:06:41.218 align:start position:0%
excuse me and with the earn time credit
 
05:06:44.930 --> 05:06:44.940 align:start position:0%
I know uh Mr Pineda had testified and
 
05:06:47.208 --> 05:06:47.218 align:start position:0%
there has been testimony by I believe Mr
 
05:06:49.610 --> 05:06:49.620 align:start position:0%
lascaz is here as well there
 
05:06:52.128 --> 05:06:52.138 align:start position:0%
experiences of being unable to get that
 
05:06:54.110 --> 05:06:54.120 align:start position:0%
much earn time credit and that is true
 
05:06:56.150 --> 05:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
for their experiences
 
05:06:57.590 --> 05:06:57.600 align:start position:0%
um I can definitely testify that that
 
05:06:59.570 --> 05:06:59.580 align:start position:0%
was absolutely true but in this
 
05:07:01.550 --> 05:07:01.560 align:start position:0%
testimony we do have some statistics of
 
05:07:05.448 --> 05:07:05.458 align:start position:0%
earn time credit that has been recently
 
05:07:09.288 --> 05:07:09.298 align:start position:0%
in 2020 only 274 inmates received earn
 
05:07:11.448 --> 05:07:11.458 align:start position:0%
time credit and that was back when the
 
05:07:14.150 --> 05:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
population of the of the gocu is uh
 
05:07:18.288 --> 05:07:18.298 align:start position:0%
around 2500 to 2000 to 3 000. in 2021
 
05:07:21.170 --> 05:07:21.180 align:start position:0%
over 1400 inmates received our time
 
05:07:21.180 --> 05:07:23.330 align:start position:0%
over 1400 inmates received our time
credit

05:07:23.330 --> 05:07:23.340 align:start position:0%
credit
 
05:07:26.990 --> 05:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
um and then last year just under 800 790
 
05:07:29.868 --> 05:07:29.878 align:start position:0%
MH received runtime credit uh a possible
 
05:07:31.430 --> 05:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
result of that lower number is the
 
05:07:33.830 --> 05:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
commissioner did do a lot of work in
 
05:07:35.570 --> 05:07:35.580 align:start position:0%
researching how
 
05:07:37.010 --> 05:07:37.020 align:start position:0%
the on-time creditors being manipulated
 
05:07:38.930 --> 05:07:38.940 align:start position:0%
through the tablet system and making it
 
05:07:40.788 --> 05:07:40.798 align:start position:0%
a little bit tougher
 
05:07:42.288 --> 05:07:42.298 align:start position:0%
um or making sure that the people are
 
05:07:43.788 --> 05:07:43.798 align:start position:0%
doing the appropriate programs to get
 
05:07:46.550 --> 05:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
the credit off their sentence as well as
 
05:07:49.070 --> 05:07:49.080 align:start position:0%
the lower number of inmates that are
 
05:07:51.830 --> 05:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
actually incarcerated at the
 
05:07:53.690 --> 05:07:53.700 align:start position:0%
um in the New Hampshire doc
 
05:07:56.810 --> 05:07:56.820 align:start position:0%
when covet hit the two years after covet
 
05:07:58.610 --> 05:07:58.620 align:start position:0%
there's been a decrease of at least 600
 
05:07:58.620 --> 05:08:00.010 align:start position:0%
there's been a decrease of at least 600
inmates

05:08:00.010 --> 05:08:00.020 align:start position:0%
inmates
 
05:08:03.830 --> 05:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
currently at the doc as attorney
 
05:08:06.590 --> 05:08:06.600 align:start position:0%
strelsen mentioned about the Arizona
 
05:08:08.930 --> 05:08:08.940 align:start position:0%
mass incarceration issue in New
 
05:08:11.270 --> 05:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the numbers at the New
 
05:08:13.128 --> 05:08:13.138 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State Prison are extremely low
 
05:08:16.850 --> 05:08:16.860 align:start position:0%
where units are being shut down
 
05:08:19.010 --> 05:08:19.020 align:start position:0%
which helps with their Extreme Staffing
 
05:08:20.510 --> 05:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
issues but as well as when I was the
 
05:08:22.250 --> 05:08:22.260 align:start position:0%
administrative classifications we had a
 
05:08:24.470 --> 05:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
200 person wait list for people waiting
 
05:08:25.730 --> 05:08:25.740 align:start position:0%
to go out to the transitional work
 
05:08:28.250 --> 05:08:28.260 align:start position:0%
center for minimum security
 
05:08:31.310 --> 05:08:31.320 align:start position:0%
there's 162 beds at that at that house
 
05:08:33.830 --> 05:08:33.840 align:start position:0%
there's only 80 inmates in there because
 
05:08:35.030 --> 05:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
there's nobody else right now that
 
05:08:35.040 --> 05:08:36.770 align:start position:0%
there's nobody else right now that
qualifies

05:08:36.770 --> 05:08:36.780 align:start position:0%
qualifies
 
05:08:39.110 --> 05:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
um so it's definitely it's definitely a
 
05:08:41.570 --> 05:08:41.580 align:start position:0%
different shift in demographics and
 
05:08:43.610 --> 05:08:43.620 align:start position:0%
inmates now with the total amount of
 
05:08:45.590 --> 05:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
inmates and
 
05:08:45.600 --> 05:08:46.430 align:start position:0%
inmates and
um

05:08:46.430 --> 05:08:46.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:08:48.170 --> 05:08:48.180 align:start position:0%
you know with this the amount of
 
05:08:49.850 --> 05:08:49.860 align:start position:0%
opportunities they have through earn
 
05:08:51.890 --> 05:08:51.900 align:start position:0%
time credit is
 
05:08:54.230 --> 05:08:54.240 align:start position:0%
um a whole lot more than they had in the
 
05:08:54.240 --> 05:08:55.190 align:start position:0%
um a whole lot more than they had in the
past

05:08:55.190 --> 05:08:55.200 align:start position:0%
past
 
05:08:58.490 --> 05:08:58.500 align:start position:0%
with RC 65120 it won't be too much on
 
05:08:58.500 --> 05:08:59.270 align:start position:0%
with RC 65120 it won't be too much on
that

05:08:59.270 --> 05:08:59.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:08:59.280 --> 05:09:00.230 align:start position:0%
that
um

05:09:00.230 --> 05:09:00.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:09:02.448 --> 05:09:02.458 align:start position:0%
now yes I in my experience working in
 
05:09:03.890 --> 05:09:03.900 align:start position:0%
the federal records classifications I've
 
05:09:05.570 --> 05:09:05.580 align:start position:0%
seen many people approved for it and
 
05:09:06.830 --> 05:09:06.840 align:start position:0%
those are the people that absolutely
 
05:09:09.948 --> 05:09:09.958 align:start position:0%
have earned it that as was described the
 
05:09:12.170 --> 05:09:12.180 align:start position:0%
processes they petition the court now
 
05:09:13.430 --> 05:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
they can do it up to a year before the
 
05:09:16.250 --> 05:09:16.260 align:start position:0%
two-thirds date they petition the court
 
05:09:18.410 --> 05:09:18.420 align:start position:0%
they detail everything that they've done
 
05:09:22.010 --> 05:09:22.020 align:start position:0%
the court contacts a doc for synopsis of
 
05:09:25.070 --> 05:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
their incarceration to confirm all of
 
05:09:26.810 --> 05:09:26.820 align:start position:0%
the stuff that they have done and then
 
05:09:29.208 --> 05:09:29.218 align:start position:0%
that goes through the prosecution the
 
05:09:31.010 --> 05:09:31.020 align:start position:0%
victims all have input and obviously the
 
05:09:33.890 --> 05:09:33.900 align:start position:0%
judge has input as well I've seen many
 
05:09:35.750 --> 05:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
people granted I've seen people not
 
05:09:38.390 --> 05:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
granted and for reasons such as
 
05:09:40.310 --> 05:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
they commend the individual for all
 
05:09:42.110 --> 05:09:42.120 align:start position:0%
their rehabilitative efforts but at the
 
05:09:44.030 --> 05:09:44.040 align:start position:0%
time of sentencing this was a fair and
 
05:09:45.830 --> 05:09:45.840 align:start position:0%
just sentence that was handed down that
 
05:09:48.050 --> 05:09:48.060 align:start position:0%
was fully negotiated in a plea deal and
 
05:09:49.788 --> 05:09:49.798 align:start position:0%
they saw no reason to lower that
 
05:09:51.530 --> 05:09:51.540 align:start position:0%
sentence at the time
 
05:09:53.690 --> 05:09:53.700 align:start position:0%
um so you know one of the one of the
 
05:09:55.190 --> 05:09:55.200 align:start position:0%
reasons that they do for denial most of
 
05:09:56.390 --> 05:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
the time they're denied is because they
 
05:09:57.948 --> 05:09:57.958 align:start position:0%
haven't actually made enough efforts at
 
05:09:57.958 --> 05:09:59.868 align:start position:0%
haven't actually made enough efforts at
Rehabilitation

05:09:59.868 --> 05:09:59.878 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation
 
05:10:02.208 --> 05:10:02.218 align:start position:0%
um and obviously if this bill was passed
 
05:10:03.948 --> 05:10:03.958 align:start position:0%
the person like I wouldn't be granted
 
05:10:06.170 --> 05:10:06.180 align:start position:0%
parole either
 
05:10:06.180 --> 05:10:07.670 align:start position:0%
parole either
um

05:10:07.670 --> 05:10:07.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:10:10.910 --> 05:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
you know in plea agreements again you
 
05:10:13.550 --> 05:10:13.560 align:start position:0%
know as attorney Andrews had mentioned
 
05:10:16.010 --> 05:10:16.020 align:start position:0%
you know I've talking with prosecutors
 
05:10:17.390 --> 05:10:17.400 align:start position:0%
myself where they said yeah he could
 
05:10:19.490 --> 05:10:19.500 align:start position:0%
have got a 7.5 to 15 but we thought with
 
05:10:21.650 --> 05:10:21.660 align:start position:0%
the goals of of uh sentencing New
 
05:10:22.910 --> 05:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire being punishment deterrence
 
05:10:25.010 --> 05:10:25.020 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation they thought those goals
 
05:10:26.208 --> 05:10:26.218 align:start position:0%
were met with a five to ten year
 
05:10:28.070 --> 05:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
sentence they only wanted the person to
 
05:10:30.410 --> 05:10:30.420 align:start position:0%
do five years
 
05:10:31.970 --> 05:10:31.980 align:start position:0%
in cases like this where they may be
 
05:10:33.770 --> 05:10:33.780 align:start position:0%
asking for more years now because if
 
05:10:35.750 --> 05:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
this bill is passed so they can get that
 
05:10:37.070 --> 05:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
certain amount of incarceration a
 
05:10:38.208 --> 05:10:38.218 align:start position:0%
certain amount of punishment that they
 
05:10:40.368 --> 05:10:40.378 align:start position:0%
deem is is just
 
05:10:42.770 --> 05:10:42.780 align:start position:0%
um to enable them to get that but if
 
05:10:44.150 --> 05:10:44.160 align:start position:0%
that person is now sentenced to seven
 
05:10:45.708 --> 05:10:45.718 align:start position:0%
and a half to Fifteen
 
05:10:47.448 --> 05:10:47.458 align:start position:0%
instead of the five or four year
 
05:10:49.070 --> 05:10:49.080 align:start position:0%
sentence they may have gotten
 
05:10:50.510 --> 05:10:50.520 align:start position:0%
they may pick up some disciplinary
 
05:10:52.070 --> 05:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
issues while at the prison and will now
 
05:10:53.570 --> 05:10:53.580 align:start position:0%
have to serve that full seven and a half
 
05:10:55.190 --> 05:10:55.200 align:start position:0%
at least until they apply for parole
 
05:10:56.810 --> 05:10:56.820 align:start position:0%
which was not the intent
 
05:10:58.430 --> 05:10:58.440 align:start position:0%
of The Plea negotiations in the
 
05:11:00.770 --> 05:11:00.780 align:start position:0%
beginning so I believe this will have a
 
05:11:04.250 --> 05:11:04.260 align:start position:0%
whole issue an issue with plea
 
05:11:04.260 --> 05:11:05.868 align:start position:0%
whole issue an issue with plea
negotiations

05:11:05.868 --> 05:11:05.878 align:start position:0%
negotiations
 
05:11:08.270 --> 05:11:08.280 align:start position:0%
one of the criteria is that the
 
05:11:10.368 --> 05:11:10.378 align:start position:0%
individuals need to complete their doc
 
05:11:13.128 --> 05:11:13.138 align:start position:0%
or Court required programs
 
05:11:15.590 --> 05:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
the way programs are done and the way
 
05:11:17.750 --> 05:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
inmates are assessed for programs is by
 
05:11:19.850 --> 05:11:19.860 align:start position:0%
your minimum parole date
 
05:11:21.708 --> 05:11:21.718 align:start position:0%
you need to be completing your programs
 
05:11:23.090 --> 05:11:23.100 align:start position:0%
when you're close to getting out so you
 
05:11:24.590 --> 05:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
can retain that information and those
 
05:11:26.628 --> 05:11:26.638 align:start position:0%
skills that you learned and work on them
 
05:11:29.270 --> 05:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
while you're reintegrating the community
 
05:11:31.670 --> 05:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
being eligible for Pearl of 50 is not a
 
05:11:31.680 --> 05:11:33.050 align:start position:0%
being eligible for Pearl of 50 is not a
guarantee

05:11:33.050 --> 05:11:33.060 align:start position:0%
guarantee
 
05:11:34.730 --> 05:11:34.740 align:start position:0%
so people will not be getting assessed
 
05:11:36.470 --> 05:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
most likely I can't speak for the doc on
 
05:11:37.850 --> 05:11:37.860 align:start position:0%
this but in my experience people will
 
05:11:39.530 --> 05:11:39.540 align:start position:0%
not be getting assessed for these
 
05:11:41.690 --> 05:11:41.700 align:start position:0%
programs until they're closer to their
 
05:11:43.430 --> 05:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
100 minimum
 
05:11:45.948 --> 05:11:45.958 align:start position:0%
because I know inmates in the past have
 
05:11:47.448 --> 05:11:47.458 align:start position:0%
asked to be assessed for a program
 
05:11:48.948 --> 05:11:48.958 align:start position:0%
because they want to apply for their
 
05:11:50.690 --> 05:11:50.700 align:start position:0%
two-thirds to the court and because
 
05:11:53.270 --> 05:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
that's not a guarantee the program says
 
05:11:55.670 --> 05:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
no because if we put you through you do
 
05:11:57.830 --> 05:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
the program and you get denied your
 
05:11:59.090 --> 05:11:59.100 align:start position:0%
two-thirds you have another three years
 
05:12:00.288 --> 05:12:00.298 align:start position:0%
before your eligible to be in the
 
05:12:01.368 --> 05:12:01.378 align:start position:0%
community and you'll have to go through
 
05:12:03.170 --> 05:12:03.180 align:start position:0%
the program again
 
05:12:05.270 --> 05:12:05.280 align:start position:0%
so this this will cause an issue with
 
05:12:07.310 --> 05:12:07.320 align:start position:0%
programming now may require the doc to
 
05:12:08.990 --> 05:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
make changes where they do
 
05:12:10.730 --> 05:12:10.740 align:start position:0%
assess somebody a lot earlier than they
 
05:12:12.830 --> 05:12:12.840 align:start position:0%
would have and maybe that pressure goes
 
05:12:13.850 --> 05:12:13.860 align:start position:0%
through the program will have to do it
 
05:12:16.128 --> 05:12:16.138 align:start position:0%
again if they don't qualify for parole
 
05:12:18.170 --> 05:12:18.180 align:start position:0%
at that time
 
05:12:18.180 --> 05:12:20.510 align:start position:0%
at that time
um

05:12:20.510 --> 05:12:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:21.948 --> 05:12:21.958 align:start position:0%
one of the biggest issues and one of the
 
05:12:24.010 --> 05:12:24.020 align:start position:0%
things I've seen in my entire career is
 
05:12:26.750 --> 05:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
working through the system Mr Pineda
 
05:12:27.948 --> 05:12:27.958 align:start position:0%
mentioned it about going through the
 
05:12:29.270 --> 05:12:29.280 align:start position:0%
transition work center in the halfway
 
05:12:31.010 --> 05:12:31.020 align:start position:0%
house and how that you know someone with
 
05:12:33.230 --> 05:12:33.240 align:start position:0%
him who had been incarcerated for about
 
05:12:35.930 --> 05:12:35.940 align:start position:0%
15 years that is extremely necessary so
 
05:12:37.070 --> 05:12:37.080 align:start position:0%
and the people we're talking about in
 
05:12:39.590 --> 05:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
this bill will have been incarcerated
 
05:12:40.730 --> 05:12:40.740 align:start position:0%
for at least three four years before
 
05:12:41.990 --> 05:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
they're eligible
 
05:12:44.030 --> 05:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
if they're if they have done enough work
 
05:12:46.190 --> 05:12:46.200 align:start position:0%
to be granted parole
 
05:12:48.350 --> 05:12:48.360 align:start position:0%
they won't they'll be granted parole
 
05:12:50.570 --> 05:12:50.580 align:start position:0%
before being eligible to go out to
 
05:12:51.830 --> 05:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
minimum security
 
05:12:53.090 --> 05:12:53.100 align:start position:0%
and all they're going to need after
 
05:12:54.948 --> 05:12:54.958 align:start position:0%
being granted parole is a housing plan
 
05:12:54.958 --> 05:12:56.090 align:start position:0%
being granted parole is a housing plan
approved

05:12:56.090 --> 05:12:56.100 align:start position:0%
approved
 
05:12:57.890 --> 05:12:57.900 align:start position:0%
most of the reason we see now when when
 
05:12:58.970 --> 05:12:58.980 align:start position:0%
some inmates are granted they're
 
05:13:01.430 --> 05:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
two-thirds they
 
05:13:03.410 --> 05:13:03.420 align:start position:0%
don't elect to go through the
 
05:13:05.448 --> 05:13:05.458 align:start position:0%
classification system to work on
 
05:13:07.368 --> 05:13:07.378 align:start position:0%
re-entry they call their buddies they
 
05:13:08.690 --> 05:13:08.700 align:start position:0%
call their family members who said hey
 
05:13:11.868 --> 05:13:11.878 align:start position:0%
can you have me live there when I get
 
05:13:11.878 --> 05:13:13.250 align:start position:0%
can you have me live there when I get
released

05:13:13.250 --> 05:13:13.260 align:start position:0%
released
 
05:13:15.288 --> 05:13:15.298 align:start position:0%
you know instead of being able to get a
 
05:13:16.730 --> 05:13:16.740 align:start position:0%
job in the community whether they're
 
05:13:18.650 --> 05:13:18.660 align:start position:0%
halfway house or working on a trade
 
05:13:19.788 --> 05:13:19.798 align:start position:0%
while they're at transitional work
 
05:13:21.410 --> 05:13:21.420 align:start position:0%
center Mr need to talk about working for
 
05:13:22.430 --> 05:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
the Department of Transportation there's
 
05:13:24.410 --> 05:13:24.420 align:start position:0%
multiple Crews that go out now for that
 
05:13:26.628 --> 05:13:26.638 align:start position:0%
and I know of at least one person off
 
05:13:28.490 --> 05:13:28.500 align:start position:0%
the top of my head that continued with
 
05:13:30.590 --> 05:13:30.600 align:start position:0%
that job afterwards
 
05:13:34.430 --> 05:13:34.440 align:start position:0%
um when he was released on parole
 
05:13:36.170 --> 05:13:36.180 align:start position:0%
this may deprive some of those inmates
 
05:13:37.970 --> 05:13:37.980 align:start position:0%
of that ability or
 
05:13:40.368 --> 05:13:40.378 align:start position:0%
when they're posed with that opportunity
 
05:13:43.788 --> 05:13:43.798 align:start position:0%
they won't take the the way to go to
 
05:13:45.948 --> 05:13:45.958 align:start position:0%
help working on that reintegration they
 
05:13:48.770 --> 05:13:48.780 align:start position:0%
will say oh well if I can get out now
 
05:13:52.128 --> 05:13:52.138 align:start position:0%
mom can I come live there you know hey
 
05:13:53.930 --> 05:13:53.940 align:start position:0%
Uncle Joe can I come live at your house
 
05:13:55.010 --> 05:13:55.020 align:start position:0%
for a little while
 
05:13:56.690 --> 05:13:56.700 align:start position:0%
and if it's approved it looks like a
 
05:13:59.090 --> 05:13:59.100 align:start position:0%
suitable residence then they they're
 
05:14:01.430 --> 05:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
able to be released
 
05:14:01.440 --> 05:14:08.510 align:start position:0%
able to be released
um

05:14:08.510 --> 05:14:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:08.520 --> 05:14:09.770 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:14:09.770 --> 05:14:09.780 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:14:09.780 --> 05:14:12.788 align:start position:0%
so
yeah

05:14:12.788 --> 05:14:12.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:14.930 --> 05:14:14.940 align:start position:0%
I believe I've touched on just about
 
05:14:17.288 --> 05:14:17.298 align:start position:0%
everything that I've seen here in other
 
05:14:19.550 --> 05:14:19.560 align:start position:0%
questions that may have Arisen
 
05:14:21.948 --> 05:14:21.958 align:start position:0%
throughout this that I've hopefully been
 
05:14:23.990 --> 05:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
able to answer I am open to any
 
05:14:26.050 --> 05:14:26.060 align:start position:0%
questions you may have
 
05:14:28.910 --> 05:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
thank you you mentioned a little bit
 
05:14:30.650 --> 05:14:30.660 align:start position:0%
earlier in your testimony that there
 
05:14:36.110 --> 05:14:36.120 align:start position:0%
were 80 out of 160 beds available at one
 
05:14:38.208 --> 05:14:38.218 align:start position:0%
of the facilities where they could earn
 
05:14:41.030 --> 05:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
more time and you said the reason being
 
05:14:44.150 --> 05:14:44.160 align:start position:0%
just not enough people were qualified or
 
05:14:45.770 --> 05:14:45.780 align:start position:0%
would qualify for that can you explain
 
05:14:47.570 --> 05:14:47.580 align:start position:0%
what that just briefly what what the
 
05:14:48.948 --> 05:14:48.958 align:start position:0%
qualifications would be and why they're
 
05:14:50.628 --> 05:14:50.638 align:start position:0%
not reading it yep so to be minimal
 
05:14:52.128 --> 05:14:52.138 align:start position:0%
security it's called C2 status the
 
05:14:53.330 --> 05:14:53.340 align:start position:0%
classification levels through the system
 
05:14:55.788 --> 05:14:55.798 align:start position:0%
are C1 Work Release to up to C5 maximum
 
05:14:58.010 --> 05:14:58.020 align:start position:0%
security C2 is minimum security it's
 
05:15:01.310 --> 05:15:01.320 align:start position:0%
outside the the main prison it's called
 
05:15:03.050 --> 05:15:03.060 align:start position:0%
the transitional work center where you
 
05:15:04.730 --> 05:15:04.740 align:start position:0%
work most of the jobs there you're
 
05:15:06.470 --> 05:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
working on the campuses of the
 
05:15:08.690 --> 05:15:08.700 align:start position:0%
facilities or you could work at the
 
05:15:10.070 --> 05:15:10.080 align:start position:0%
retail store you can work at the
 
05:15:11.150 --> 05:15:11.160 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation on road
 
05:15:12.890 --> 05:15:12.900 align:start position:0%
crews you can work with Sergeant Johnson
 
05:15:14.590 --> 05:15:14.600 align:start position:0%
does road crews goes into the community
 
05:15:17.390 --> 05:15:17.400 align:start position:0%
paints municip municipal buildings and
 
05:15:19.128 --> 05:15:19.138 align:start position:0%
you know stuff like that
 
05:15:19.138 --> 05:15:20.390 align:start position:0%
you know stuff like that
um

05:15:20.390 --> 05:15:20.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:15:23.150 --> 05:15:23.160 align:start position:0%
to be eligible for C2 and I should have
 
05:15:24.708 --> 05:15:24.718 align:start position:0%
touched on it it's in my written
 
05:15:27.050 --> 05:15:27.060 align:start position:0%
testimony you need to be at least two
 
05:15:29.090 --> 05:15:29.100 align:start position:0%
years to your minimum parole date
 
05:15:31.310 --> 05:15:31.320 align:start position:0%
so right now classifications doesn't
 
05:15:32.868 --> 05:15:32.878 align:start position:0%
have enough people that are that close
 
05:15:34.730 --> 05:15:34.740 align:start position:0%
to the minimum parole date that meet
 
05:15:37.250 --> 05:15:37.260 align:start position:0%
other qualifications as well to go out
 
05:15:38.750 --> 05:15:38.760 align:start position:0%
there one of the qualifications you need
 
05:15:41.690 --> 05:15:41.700 align:start position:0%
to complete your intensive programming
 
05:15:43.250 --> 05:15:43.260 align:start position:0%
so if you're a sex offender you need to
 
05:15:44.690 --> 05:15:44.700 align:start position:0%
complete your sex offender treatment if
 
05:15:46.310 --> 05:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
you are deemed as needing intensive drug
 
05:15:47.570 --> 05:15:47.580 align:start position:0%
treatment you need a complete Focus
 
05:15:49.788 --> 05:15:49.798 align:start position:0%
program before you can go out there
 
05:15:52.070 --> 05:15:52.080 align:start position:0%
um okay yeah like I said we had a wait
 
05:15:54.170 --> 05:15:54.180 align:start position:0%
list when I was a case manager it was
 
05:15:56.030 --> 05:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
widely known that once somebody was
 
05:15:58.190 --> 05:15:58.200 align:start position:0%
granted C2 approved C2 they were waiting
 
05:15:59.570 --> 05:15:59.580 align:start position:0%
three months before they went out to the
 
05:16:01.430 --> 05:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
transitional work center now there's no
 
05:16:02.930 --> 05:16:02.940 align:start position:0%
weight now they're trying to push not
 
05:16:04.190 --> 05:16:04.200 align:start position:0%
push people out there but they're trying
 
05:16:06.830 --> 05:16:06.840 align:start position:0%
to fill the beds be because it is a very
 
05:16:11.448 --> 05:16:11.458 align:start position:0%
good place to go for rehabilitation
 
05:16:13.550 --> 05:16:13.560 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler
 
05:16:15.230 --> 05:16:15.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
05:16:16.610 --> 05:16:16.620 align:start position:0%
taking my question and for all the
 
05:16:18.110 --> 05:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
information about the parole board you
 
05:16:19.490 --> 05:16:19.500 align:start position:0%
gave us I think that's very helpful not
 
05:16:22.190 --> 05:16:22.200 align:start position:0%
just for this legislation but in general
 
05:16:23.990 --> 05:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
um what is the standard that the parole
 
05:16:26.510 --> 05:16:26.520 align:start position:0%
board uses for rehabilitation how do you
 
05:16:29.990 --> 05:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:30.000 --> 05:16:31.128 align:start position:0%
 
that

05:16:31.128 --> 05:16:31.138 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:16:32.330 --> 05:16:32.340 align:start position:0%
in the administrative rules for the
 
05:16:35.448 --> 05:16:35.458 align:start position:0%
parole board there are multiple factors
 
05:16:36.890 --> 05:16:36.900 align:start position:0%
that are
 
05:16:36.900 --> 05:16:38.090 align:start position:0%
that are
um

05:16:38.090 --> 05:16:38.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:16:40.990 --> 05:16:41.000 align:start position:0%
that are reviewed when it comes to
 
05:16:43.850 --> 05:16:43.860 align:start position:0%
showing remorse showing accountability
 
05:16:46.670 --> 05:16:46.680 align:start position:0%
for your actions Obviously good behavior
 
05:16:49.010 --> 05:16:49.020 align:start position:0%
while you're in incarcerated to to an
 
05:16:50.890 --> 05:16:50.900 align:start position:0%
extent we have some guidelines around
 
05:16:53.390 --> 05:16:53.400 align:start position:0%
disciplinary fractions
 
05:16:53.400 --> 05:16:54.530 align:start position:0%
disciplinary fractions
um

05:16:54.530 --> 05:16:54.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:16:57.050 --> 05:16:57.060 align:start position:0%
what what what is your plan moving
 
05:16:58.788 --> 05:16:58.798 align:start position:0%
forward how do you present yourself in
 
05:17:00.948 --> 05:17:00.958 align:start position:0%
the parole hearing itself
 
05:17:03.050 --> 05:17:03.060 align:start position:0%
um you know like you said you know you
 
05:17:04.490 --> 05:17:04.500 align:start position:0%
show accountability for your actions
 
05:17:07.010 --> 05:17:07.020 align:start position:0%
right do you show remorse there are many
 
05:17:08.930 --> 05:17:08.940 align:start position:0%
people that are
 
05:17:11.868 --> 05:17:11.878 align:start position:0%
um they deny their crime or they are
 
05:17:14.330 --> 05:17:14.340 align:start position:0%
diverting blame and stuff like that and
 
05:17:15.948 --> 05:17:15.958 align:start position:0%
that shows that somebody's not really
 
05:17:18.288 --> 05:17:18.298 align:start position:0%
ready to be released
 
05:17:18.298 --> 05:17:19.190 align:start position:0%
ready to be released
um

05:17:19.190 --> 05:17:19.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:17:22.250 --> 05:17:22.260 align:start position:0%
in in the cases of like Mr Pineda I I
 
05:17:24.170 --> 05:17:24.180 align:start position:0%
actually remember his name I believe I
 
05:17:25.490 --> 05:17:25.500 align:start position:0%
was in classifications when he was there
 
05:17:27.948 --> 05:17:27.958 align:start position:0%
and I remember an officer actually
 
05:17:30.470 --> 05:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
saying this person needs to be granted
 
05:17:32.208 --> 05:17:32.218 align:start position:0%
parole like this is the type of person
 
05:17:34.730 --> 05:17:34.740 align:start position:0%
that is like when you look at sports
 
05:17:37.430 --> 05:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
individuals and you say you ask is this
 
05:17:39.470 --> 05:17:39.480 align:start position:0%
person a Hall of Famer if you cannot say
 
05:17:41.208 --> 05:17:41.218 align:start position:0%
right off the top yes they're all a
 
05:17:42.230 --> 05:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
Famer and they might not be a Hall of
 
05:17:44.510 --> 05:17:44.520 align:start position:0%
Famer kind of goes the same way for some
 
05:17:46.250 --> 05:17:46.260 align:start position:0%
people on parole it's like that person
 
05:17:47.510 --> 05:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
should be granted parole they've done
 
05:17:49.610 --> 05:17:49.620 align:start position:0%
everything to change their life you know
 
05:17:51.410 --> 05:17:51.420 align:start position:0%
there are some people who
 
05:17:53.208 --> 05:17:53.218 align:start position:0%
can fake it till they make it and it's
 
05:17:55.910 --> 05:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
unfortunate but those people do get by
 
05:17:58.010 --> 05:17:58.020 align:start position:0%
most of the time the parole board you
 
05:17:59.570 --> 05:17:59.580 align:start position:0%
know asks a lot of tough questions
 
05:18:01.910 --> 05:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
during the hearings to find those
 
05:18:04.070 --> 05:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
individuals and and make sure that they
 
05:18:06.050 --> 05:18:06.060 align:start position:0%
are indeed ready the pro board cannot
 
05:18:08.030 --> 05:18:08.040 align:start position:0%
arbitrarily deny anyone we have to have
 
05:18:09.948 --> 05:18:09.958 align:start position:0%
a reason we have to set
 
05:18:09.958 --> 05:18:10.550 align:start position:0%
a reason we have to set
um

05:18:10.550 --> 05:18:10.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:18:13.430 --> 05:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
conditions of what they need to do to
 
05:18:15.530 --> 05:18:15.540 align:start position:0%
come back in front of us once they once
 
05:18:19.070 --> 05:18:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:22.430 --> 05:18:22.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um what would you
 
05:18:24.470 --> 05:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
say there's been people and if so how
 
05:18:27.110 --> 05:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
many who have been released or given
 
05:18:29.330 --> 05:18:29.340 align:start position:0%
parole who under your definition
 
05:18:31.730 --> 05:18:31.740 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be rehabilitated
 
05:18:33.890 --> 05:18:33.900 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't be rehabilitated I'm kind
 
05:18:36.110 --> 05:18:36.120 align:start position:0%
of hoping none but
 
05:18:36.120 --> 05:18:37.788 align:start position:0%
of hoping none but
um

05:18:37.788 --> 05:18:37.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:18:39.410 --> 05:18:39.420 align:start position:0%
and also like I had said about people
 
05:18:40.730 --> 05:18:40.740 align:start position:0%
that can fake it till they make it they
 
05:18:43.550 --> 05:18:43.560 align:start position:0%
present really well and and I mean we
 
05:18:45.350 --> 05:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
have the case of I don't know how many
 
05:18:46.368 --> 05:18:46.378 align:start position:0%
people know their name but Brian
 
05:18:48.410 --> 05:18:48.420 align:start position:0%
shervalley he's I believe the reason
 
05:18:50.750 --> 05:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
there was a parole board in 2019 he was
 
05:18:52.310 --> 05:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
released he was down at the halfway
 
05:18:53.270 --> 05:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
house so as a classifications
 
05:18:55.190 --> 05:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
administrator I knew he did all of the
 
05:18:57.530 --> 05:18:57.540 align:start position:0%
program he needed to do to make his way
 
05:19:00.050 --> 05:19:00.060 align:start position:0%
down into Community Corrections and then
 
05:19:03.350 --> 05:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
was released on parole and couple months
 
05:19:04.788 --> 05:19:04.798 align:start position:0%
after he was released on parole he
 
05:19:06.948 --> 05:19:06.958 align:start position:0%
murdered somebody in Massachusetts
 
05:19:08.930 --> 05:19:08.940 align:start position:0%
so and then he blamed the parole board
 
05:19:10.670 --> 05:19:10.680 align:start position:0%
for releasing him that he should have
 
05:19:11.690 --> 05:19:11.700 align:start position:0%
never been released but all the
 
05:19:13.490 --> 05:19:13.500 align:start position:0%
documentation and the presentation of
 
05:19:15.410 --> 05:19:15.420 align:start position:0%
him at the parole board
 
05:19:17.868 --> 05:19:17.878 align:start position:0%
showed that he had done everything that
 
05:19:20.208 --> 05:19:20.218 align:start position:0%
he should have done and to rehabilitate
 
05:19:22.850 --> 05:19:22.860 align:start position:0%
himself and and to be released
 
05:19:25.190 --> 05:19:25.200 align:start position:0%
we certainly look at the mandatory
 
05:19:27.230 --> 05:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
toward programs that they are supposed
 
05:19:29.890 --> 05:19:29.900 align:start position:0%
to complete those that the court
 
05:19:33.230 --> 05:19:33.240 align:start position:0%
required and also we look at programs
 
05:19:35.030 --> 05:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
that they voluntarily did
 
05:19:39.230 --> 05:19:39.240 align:start position:0%
uh but uh actually I've been impressed
 
05:19:41.150 --> 05:19:41.160 align:start position:0%
with the number of programs I have I
 
05:19:43.750 --> 05:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
certainly wish that they could have more
 
05:19:49.550 --> 05:19:49.560 align:start position:0%
as has been uh mentioned earlier uh but
 
05:19:51.470 --> 05:19:51.480 align:start position:0%
there's only so much staff and so much
 
05:19:58.670 --> 05:19:58.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:06.410 --> 05:20:06.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:17.510 --> 05:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:19.910 --> 05:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
good afternoon I'm sitting here before
 
05:20:21.948 --> 05:20:21.958 align:start position:0%
you as part of the National Council for
 
05:20:23.510 --> 05:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
incarcerated and formerly incarcerated
 
05:20:25.310 --> 05:20:25.320 align:start position:0%
women but also as a formerly
 
05:20:27.708 --> 05:20:27.718 align:start position:0%
incarcerated woman myself and so in
 
05:20:29.030 --> 05:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
listening to a lot of important
 
05:20:31.310 --> 05:20:31.320 align:start position:0%
discussion that's been going on I've
 
05:20:32.628 --> 05:20:32.638 align:start position:0%
kind of scrapped everything that I
 
05:20:33.948 --> 05:20:33.958 align:start position:0%
thought I was going to say and trying to
 
05:20:36.110 --> 05:20:36.120 align:start position:0%
respond to things that were have been
 
05:20:37.330 --> 05:20:37.340 align:start position:0%
said today
 
05:20:40.368 --> 05:20:40.378 align:start position:0%
so I just want to I'm sorry if it's
 
05:20:42.110 --> 05:20:42.120 align:start position:0%
disjointed for that reason who's been
 
05:20:44.810 --> 05:20:44.820 align:start position:0%
privacy taking notes someone had
 
05:20:47.390 --> 05:20:47.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned that that when you go when you
 
05:20:48.890 --> 05:20:48.900 align:start position:0%
commit a transgression you have a chance
 
05:20:52.070 --> 05:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
to go and the judge hears both sides in
 
05:20:53.750 --> 05:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
the in the experience of myself or other
 
05:20:55.550 --> 05:20:55.560 align:start position:0%
women that I have been incarcerated with
 
05:20:57.288 --> 05:20:57.298 align:start position:0%
that was not the case because the
 
05:20:59.868 --> 05:20:59.878 align:start position:0%
majority of the women took plea deals in
 
05:21:01.128 --> 05:21:01.138 align:start position:0%
which they didn't have the chance to
 
05:21:03.530 --> 05:21:03.540 align:start position:0%
speak for their side out of fear for a
 
05:21:05.990 --> 05:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
more lengthy sentence
 
05:21:07.610 --> 05:21:07.620 align:start position:0%
um I think it's important to remember
 
05:21:10.010 --> 05:21:10.020 align:start position:0%
that the the women and I'll speak for
 
05:21:11.448 --> 05:21:11.458 align:start position:0%
the women because I was incarcerated
 
05:21:13.310 --> 05:21:13.320 align:start position:0%
with them and I am a woman who is
 
05:21:16.250 --> 05:21:16.260 align:start position:0%
incarcerated only Lee a lot of a lot of
 
05:21:17.868 --> 05:21:17.878 align:start position:0%
them are victims themselves right so
 
05:21:19.490 --> 05:21:19.500 align:start position:0%
we're talking about I'm not justifying
 
05:21:20.990 --> 05:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
any time that they may have caused harm
 
05:21:23.270 --> 05:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
to other people but in listening to
 
05:21:24.590 --> 05:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
their stories and learning about who
 
05:21:27.110 --> 05:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
they are as human beings the amount of
 
05:21:28.788 --> 05:21:28.798 align:start position:0%
trauma that most of them have endured
 
05:21:31.010 --> 05:21:31.020 align:start position:0%
has been heartbreaking
 
05:21:32.690 --> 05:21:32.700 align:start position:0%
um with unspeakable things that they've
 
05:21:33.970 --> 05:21:33.980 align:start position:0%
had to go through
 
05:21:37.128 --> 05:21:37.138 align:start position:0%
marginalization poverty extreme abuse
 
05:21:39.110 --> 05:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
and neglect doesn't justify their
 
05:21:41.448 --> 05:21:41.458 align:start position:0%
behavior later on as an adult but a lot
 
05:21:43.788 --> 05:21:43.798 align:start position:0%
of them are ill-equipped and haven't had
 
05:21:45.590 --> 05:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
the necessary guidance so I just like to
 
05:21:48.530 --> 05:21:48.540 align:start position:0%
remember that piece and it helped me to
 
05:21:50.270 --> 05:21:50.280 align:start position:0%
learn more about them as as human beings
 
05:21:52.788 --> 05:21:52.798 align:start position:0%
and for myself to be humanized in spite
 
05:21:54.470 --> 05:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
of my mistakes
 
05:21:57.590 --> 05:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
I do want to um somebody had mentioned I
 
05:21:59.390 --> 05:21:59.400 align:start position:0%
think representative wheeler you had
 
05:22:01.250 --> 05:22:01.260 align:start position:0%
asked a great question about how do we
 
05:22:01.260 --> 05:22:02.510 align:start position:0%
asked a great question about how do we
address

05:22:02.510 --> 05:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
address
 
05:22:03.770 --> 05:22:03.780 align:start position:0%
um the point for people who have been
 
05:22:05.690 --> 05:22:05.700 align:start position:0%
victimized so that they're not feeling
 
05:22:07.430 --> 05:22:07.440 align:start position:0%
like they didn't have the healing and
 
05:22:08.868 --> 05:22:08.878 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry if I'm getting your question
 
05:22:11.510 --> 05:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
and correct but I thought about the fact
 
05:22:13.610 --> 05:22:13.620 align:start position:0%
that um I've been victimized and
 
05:22:15.890 --> 05:22:15.900 align:start position:0%
assaulted when I was a child and what I
 
05:22:18.530 --> 05:22:18.540 align:start position:0%
was missing was the reparation the
 
05:22:20.750 --> 05:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
chance for me to get that acknowledgment
 
05:22:22.310 --> 05:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
and validation from the person who
 
05:22:25.850 --> 05:22:25.860 align:start position:0%
harmed me I think initially my my gut
 
05:22:27.650 --> 05:22:27.660 align:start position:0%
reaction as a young child who was harmed
 
05:22:29.510 --> 05:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
would have been like yes please punish
 
05:22:33.470 --> 05:22:33.480 align:start position:0%
him let him suffer like I did but when I
 
05:22:35.270 --> 05:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
really think about it and now as I sit
 
05:22:36.708 --> 05:22:36.718 align:start position:0%
here before you as a mother of three
 
05:22:39.948 --> 05:22:39.958 align:start position:0%
children what I want is that opportunity
 
05:22:42.230 --> 05:22:42.240 align:start position:0%
to send out even at this day as an adult
 
05:22:44.270 --> 05:22:44.280 align:start position:0%
woman sit down and say this is how you
 
05:22:46.430 --> 05:22:46.440 align:start position:0%
impacted me and I just need you to know
 
05:22:48.590 --> 05:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
that and let that kind of reparation
 
05:22:51.050 --> 05:22:51.060 align:start position:0%
occur so I'm hoping that answers your
 
05:22:54.230 --> 05:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
question as a previous victim victimized
 
05:22:57.050 --> 05:22:57.060 align:start position:0%
person and I do want to personalize
 
05:22:58.910 --> 05:22:58.920 align:start position:0%
right now down the road about a few
 
05:23:01.128 --> 05:23:01.138 align:start position:0%
miles is the both men and women's prison
 
05:23:03.050 --> 05:23:03.060 align:start position:0%
and there are some women in there who
 
05:23:05.150 --> 05:23:05.160 align:start position:0%
are sitting there as we speak
 
05:23:06.890 --> 05:23:06.900 align:start position:0%
um and I do want to just bring their
 
05:23:08.690 --> 05:23:08.700 align:start position:0%
name um their first name to your
 
05:23:10.310 --> 05:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
attention in a situation that they're in
 
05:23:13.070 --> 05:23:13.080 align:start position:0%
for example Nicole sentenced when she
 
05:23:16.010 --> 05:23:16.020 align:start position:0%
was 17 years old she's now in her 30s
 
05:23:18.590 --> 05:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
and she was she's been sentenced to a
 
05:23:20.930 --> 05:23:20.940 align:start position:0%
quote violent crime but yet in her
 
05:23:23.208 --> 05:23:23.218 align:start position:0%
presence I've never seen her be violent
 
05:23:25.250 --> 05:23:25.260 align:start position:0%
in any kind of way shape or form she is
 
05:23:28.670 --> 05:23:28.680 align:start position:0%
actually a model resident in which she
 
05:23:30.230 --> 05:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
participates and takes advantage of
 
05:23:33.830 --> 05:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
everything gets minimal write-ups
 
05:23:35.690 --> 05:23:35.700 align:start position:0%
um you know just seems like a normal
 
05:23:37.368 --> 05:23:37.378 align:start position:0%
human being when you're just talking in
 
05:23:39.350 --> 05:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
conversation with her and she's handled
 
05:23:41.150 --> 05:23:41.160 align:start position:0%
herself now all these years she's grown
 
05:23:43.788 --> 05:23:43.798 align:start position:0%
up in prison and she's tried every
 
05:23:46.070 --> 05:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
Avenue to get out of prison
 
05:23:47.510 --> 05:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
um you know we've talked about all these
 
05:23:49.850 --> 05:23:49.860 align:start position:0%
ways your two-thirds earned time credit
 
05:23:51.890 --> 05:23:51.900 align:start position:0%
getting your judge to reduce your
 
05:23:53.570 --> 05:23:53.580 align:start position:0%
sentence and none of them have been
 
05:23:55.128 --> 05:23:55.138 align:start position:0%
proven effective yes you she earned the
 
05:23:58.788 --> 05:23:58.798 align:start position:0%
21 month off over many many years of
 
05:24:01.310 --> 05:24:01.320 align:start position:0%
time but that's nothing when you talk
 
05:24:02.868 --> 05:24:02.878 align:start position:0%
about the amount of her life that she's
 
05:24:04.850 --> 05:24:04.860 align:start position:0%
missed she she likely will not be able
 
05:24:06.770 --> 05:24:06.780 align:start position:0%
to bear or have her own children because
 
05:24:08.090 --> 05:24:08.100 align:start position:0%
she will have been incarcerated that
 
05:24:10.750 --> 05:24:10.760 align:start position:0%
entire time she is arguably
 
05:24:13.010 --> 05:24:13.020 align:start position:0%
institutionalized right when you talk to
 
05:24:14.628 --> 05:24:14.638 align:start position:0%
women who are released after a long
 
05:24:17.208 --> 05:24:17.218 align:start position:0%
period of time another woman Angie in
 
05:24:18.890 --> 05:24:18.900 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts I just she was just
 
05:24:21.410 --> 05:24:21.420 align:start position:0%
released after 33 I think 30 years being
 
05:24:24.170 --> 05:24:24.180 align:start position:0%
in prison she's scared to go to her own
 
05:24:25.788 --> 05:24:25.798 align:start position:0%
appointments and needs her children to
 
05:24:27.770 --> 05:24:27.780 align:start position:0%
drive her there doesn't know how to use
 
05:24:29.690 --> 05:24:29.700 align:start position:0%
a cell phone I mean you think about how
 
05:24:32.750 --> 05:24:32.760 align:start position:0%
fast technology Moves In keeping up with
 
05:24:34.070 --> 05:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
that and coming out into the community
 
05:24:37.448 --> 05:24:37.458 align:start position:0%
when things have changed in so much time
 
05:24:39.530 --> 05:24:39.540 align:start position:0%
how you know I'm just trying to imagine
 
05:24:41.868 --> 05:24:41.878 align:start position:0%
what is that like to survive after Ben
 
05:24:44.410 --> 05:24:44.420 align:start position:0%
you know you've been inside for so long
 
05:24:48.110 --> 05:24:48.120 align:start position:0%
there's a woman named Sam Who's down the
 
05:24:49.670 --> 05:24:49.680 align:start position:0%
road right now she's been incarcerated
 
05:24:53.030 --> 05:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
for 33 years she is an old woman now in
 
05:24:55.490 --> 05:24:55.500 align:start position:0%
her 70s she can and not really breathe
 
05:24:57.288 --> 05:24:57.298 align:start position:0%
well she needs a machine sometimes to
 
05:24:59.810 --> 05:24:59.820 align:start position:0%
breathe she can't have a a cell on the
 
05:25:01.430 --> 05:25:01.440 align:start position:0%
second floor because she can't go up and
 
05:25:04.430 --> 05:25:04.440 align:start position:0%
down stairs she too has accessed
 
05:25:07.070 --> 05:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
everything to try to redeem herself and
 
05:25:08.990 --> 05:25:09.000 align:start position:0%
is the sweetest old woman you would ever
 
05:25:11.030 --> 05:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
meet like I would want her as my own
 
05:25:13.490 --> 05:25:13.500 align:start position:0%
grandmother she is highly involved in
 
05:25:17.270 --> 05:25:17.280 align:start position:0%
faith Services she is a mentor to other
 
05:25:18.948 --> 05:25:18.958 align:start position:0%
women she sits down on her own accord
 
05:25:21.430 --> 05:25:21.440 align:start position:0%
and has private Bible studies with them
 
05:25:24.350 --> 05:25:24.360 align:start position:0%
she too and her family has tried many
 
05:25:26.390 --> 05:25:26.400 align:start position:0%
many times in many different ways to get
 
05:25:28.788 --> 05:25:28.798 align:start position:0%
her out and yet she's afraid that she
 
05:25:30.550 --> 05:25:30.560 align:start position:0%
may die in prison
 
05:25:33.708 --> 05:25:33.718 align:start position:0%
and you know again I I would allow her
 
05:25:35.390 --> 05:25:35.400 align:start position:0%
to be around my children like I've spent
 
05:25:37.250 --> 05:25:37.260 align:start position:0%
time with her and had conversation with
 
05:25:37.260 --> 05:25:38.448 align:start position:0%
time with her and had conversation with
her

05:25:38.448 --> 05:25:38.458 align:start position:0%
her
 
05:25:38.458 --> 05:25:39.050 align:start position:0%
her
um

05:25:39.050 --> 05:25:39.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:25:40.730 --> 05:25:40.740 align:start position:0%
so I hope that in painting this picture
 
05:25:42.708 --> 05:25:42.718 align:start position:0%
I just you know I'm sitting here and
 
05:25:43.970 --> 05:25:43.980 align:start position:0%
listening and we're all these people
 
05:25:46.850 --> 05:25:46.860 align:start position:0%
making decisions about other people and
 
05:25:48.650 --> 05:25:48.660 align:start position:0%
I wanted to represent that voice today
 
05:25:50.390 --> 05:25:50.400 align:start position:0%
right people who make mistakes people
 
05:25:51.830 --> 05:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
who are
 
05:25:54.770 --> 05:25:54.780 align:start position:0%
um you know sorry and and trying to
 
05:25:56.448 --> 05:25:56.458 align:start position:0%
redeem themselves in some way and
 
05:25:58.310 --> 05:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
everybody deserves a chance at
 
05:26:02.628 --> 05:26:02.638 align:start position:0%
Redemption so thank you for hearing me
 
05:26:05.208 --> 05:26:05.218 align:start position:0%
thank you for your your testimony and
 
05:26:06.590 --> 05:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
you certainly uh spoke from the heart
 
05:26:08.330 --> 05:26:08.340 align:start position:0%
and I I just have one question for you
 
05:26:09.770 --> 05:26:09.780 align:start position:0%
if I may
 
05:26:12.110 --> 05:26:12.120 align:start position:0%
um under the under the bill that we're
 
05:26:15.708 --> 05:26:15.718 align:start position:0%
here hearing testimony on would would
 
05:26:18.230 --> 05:26:18.240 align:start position:0%
this have made you been eligible for
 
05:26:20.030 --> 05:26:20.040 align:start position:0%
Pearl sooner this bill would not have
 
05:26:21.708 --> 05:26:21.718 align:start position:0%
applied to me so I'm speaking when I'm
 
05:26:23.270 --> 05:26:23.280 align:start position:0%
speaking I'm I'm thinking of all the
 
05:26:25.010 --> 05:26:25.020 align:start position:0%
women that it could have applied to or
 
05:26:26.750 --> 05:26:26.760 align:start position:0%
even the women the women that it would
 
05:26:29.628 --> 05:26:29.638 align:start position:0%
not have applied to and it should have
 
05:26:33.530 --> 05:26:33.540 align:start position:0%
thank you for their representative Noel
 
05:26:35.750 --> 05:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Sharon thank you for taking
 
05:26:37.070 --> 05:26:37.080 align:start position:0%
my question
 
05:26:38.868 --> 05:26:38.878 align:start position:0%
um and thank you so much for coming here
 
05:26:41.208 --> 05:26:41.218 align:start position:0%
and and representing truly The Human
 
05:26:44.270 --> 05:26:44.280 align:start position:0%
Side of of this right and um I think
 
05:26:45.830 --> 05:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
we've heard a lot about the things that
 
05:26:47.270 --> 05:26:47.280 align:start position:0%
are taken into consideration different
 
05:26:48.830 --> 05:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
programs different ways that you can
 
05:26:50.690 --> 05:26:50.700 align:start position:0%
kind of demonstrate
 
05:26:52.970 --> 05:26:52.980 align:start position:0%
um that you have been rehabilitated in
 
05:26:55.490 --> 05:26:55.500 align:start position:0%
some way and I'm wondering you know you
 
05:26:56.990 --> 05:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
what you've brought here today I think
 
05:26:58.550 --> 05:26:58.560 align:start position:0%
is really
 
05:27:02.390 --> 05:27:02.400 align:start position:0%
um the trauma of you know humanizing
 
05:27:05.270 --> 05:27:05.280 align:start position:0%
um what goes into someone taking an
 
05:27:06.890 --> 05:27:06.900 align:start position:0%
action that may put them behind bars
 
05:27:09.170 --> 05:27:09.180 align:start position:0%
right I mean um lead to incarcer
 
05:27:11.030 --> 05:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
representative could you please ask your
 
05:27:11.040 --> 05:27:12.948 align:start position:0%
representative could you please ask your
question

05:27:12.948 --> 05:27:12.958 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:27:16.128 --> 05:27:16.138 align:start position:0%
and so my question is how do you see
 
05:27:18.708 --> 05:27:18.718 align:start position:0%
that factoring in to
 
05:27:21.190 --> 05:27:21.200 align:start position:0%
um the things that have been
 
05:27:24.230 --> 05:27:24.240 align:start position:0%
demonstrated uh yeah
 
05:27:26.930 --> 05:27:26.940 align:start position:0%
that's you get my question yes I do
 
05:27:30.350 --> 05:27:30.360 align:start position:0%
um I think that uh we're all human right
 
05:27:32.570 --> 05:27:32.580 align:start position:0%
and I would argue that almost
 
05:27:34.070 --> 05:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
everybody's sitting in the prison both
 
05:27:35.990 --> 05:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
men and women or even in the jails today
 
05:27:38.448 --> 05:27:38.458 align:start position:0%
have endured a lot
 
05:27:41.208 --> 05:27:41.218 align:start position:0%
um and and haven't necessarily had the
 
05:27:42.590 --> 05:27:42.600 align:start position:0%
supports right there's so many people
 
05:27:45.590 --> 05:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
who don't have anybody to call home to
 
05:27:47.330 --> 05:27:47.340 align:start position:0%
on the weekends or don't have anybody to
 
05:27:49.788 --> 05:27:49.798 align:start position:0%
put money on their books um and actually
 
05:27:51.590 --> 05:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
could just side note going back to
 
05:27:53.510 --> 05:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
Nicole she was just told recently that
 
05:27:55.670 --> 05:27:55.680 align:start position:0%
she needed five thousand dollars to pay
 
05:27:58.490 --> 05:27:58.500 align:start position:0%
for a lawyer just a retainer fee to try
 
05:28:00.590 --> 05:28:00.600 align:start position:0%
to pursue another Avenue out of prison
 
05:28:02.628 --> 05:28:02.638 align:start position:0%
and she you know makes a dollar a day
 
05:28:05.930 --> 05:28:05.940 align:start position:0%
and so just how defeating that would be
 
05:28:07.368 --> 05:28:07.378 align:start position:0%
um anyway side note back to your
 
05:28:09.830 --> 05:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
question yeah I think that myself
 
05:28:12.350 --> 05:28:12.360 align:start position:0%
included and all of these people have a
 
05:28:14.448 --> 05:28:14.458 align:start position:0%
significant amount of trauma and at the
 
05:28:16.310 --> 05:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
end of the day you know it's
 
05:28:18.530 --> 05:28:18.540 align:start position:0%
embarrassing and it's we have a lot of
 
05:28:20.868 --> 05:28:20.878 align:start position:0%
Shame around making mistakes and being
 
05:28:22.368 --> 05:28:22.378 align:start position:0%
put in the public eye and being
 
05:28:25.610 --> 05:28:25.620 align:start position:0%
scrutinized and I can't speak for
 
05:28:27.770 --> 05:28:27.780 align:start position:0%
everybody but you know I want a chance
 
05:28:30.590 --> 05:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
at Redemption I want a chance you know
 
05:28:32.750 --> 05:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
to not sit behind bars and be away from
 
05:28:34.610 --> 05:28:34.620 align:start position:0%
my family I mean the time that I spent
 
05:28:36.830 --> 05:28:36.840 align:start position:0%
away from my children was the most
 
05:28:39.650 --> 05:28:39.660 align:start position:0%
excruciating curl you into a ball pain
 
05:28:41.628 --> 05:28:41.638 align:start position:0%
that I can ever explain to you there
 
05:28:43.730 --> 05:28:43.740 align:start position:0%
aren't enough words for it and in fact
 
05:28:45.410 --> 05:28:45.420 align:start position:0%
listening to the pain of my own children
 
05:28:48.050 --> 05:28:48.060 align:start position:0%
being separated from me
 
05:28:49.788 --> 05:28:49.798 align:start position:0%
um is so painful it's hard to hear it's
 
05:28:49.798 --> 05:28:50.810 align:start position:0%
um is so painful it's hard to hear it's
actually

05:28:50.810 --> 05:28:50.820 align:start position:0%
actually
 
05:28:53.270 --> 05:28:53.280 align:start position:0%
hard to even look at pictures
 
05:28:56.030 --> 05:28:56.040 align:start position:0%
um of the time while I was away so to
 
05:28:59.390 --> 05:28:59.400 align:start position:0%
cut a sentence in half by 50 it's not an
 
05:29:01.010 --> 05:29:01.020 align:start position:0%
automatic it's not a given you're still
 
05:29:02.570 --> 05:29:02.580 align:start position:0%
trying to earn it right and you still
 
05:29:05.448 --> 05:29:05.458 align:start position:0%
have to sit before a parole board and in
 
05:29:09.170 --> 05:29:09.180 align:start position:0%
many ways relive your your sentencing in
 
05:29:10.550 --> 05:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
some ways right you have to defend
 
05:29:12.948 --> 05:29:12.958 align:start position:0%
yourself again you have to relive you
 
05:29:15.470 --> 05:29:15.480 align:start position:0%
know what you did wrong and I'm I don't
 
05:29:17.810 --> 05:29:17.820 align:start position:0%
want to excuse wrongdoing I want to be
 
05:29:20.208 --> 05:29:20.218 align:start position:0%
very clear about that but it is a human
 
05:29:22.128 --> 05:29:22.138 align:start position:0%
process right we're all human beings and
 
05:29:24.288 --> 05:29:24.298 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day and I as a mother
 
05:29:26.448 --> 05:29:26.458 align:start position:0%
I don't want our streets to be unsafe I
 
05:29:29.150 --> 05:29:29.160 align:start position:0%
don't want them to be unsafe and yet I
 
05:29:30.890 --> 05:29:30.900 align:start position:0%
can also look at the human component of
 
05:29:33.050 --> 05:29:33.060 align:start position:0%
this and say that I'm quite sure that
 
05:29:35.750 --> 05:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
prison is not healing anybody or making
 
05:29:38.448 --> 05:29:38.458 align:start position:0%
our streets safer in the long term it
 
05:29:39.970 --> 05:29:39.980 align:start position:0%
might put a Band-Aid on it because
 
05:29:44.510 --> 05:29:44.520 align:start position:0%
they're unavailable or in a Cell but at
 
05:29:46.070 --> 05:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
some point most people are returning
 
05:29:48.410 --> 05:29:48.420 align:start position:0%
back to the street and we want them to
 
05:29:51.350 --> 05:29:51.360 align:start position:0%
have be a better stronger wiser are a
 
05:29:53.810 --> 05:29:53.820 align:start position:0%
more well-adjusted person and and what I
 
05:29:55.310 --> 05:29:55.320 align:start position:0%
see happening in the prisons what I've
 
05:29:59.810 --> 05:29:59.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:03.368 --> 05:30:03.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:07.070 --> 05:30:07.080 align:start position:0%
thank you thanks for taking my question
 
05:30:09.050 --> 05:30:09.060 align:start position:0%
um so you've been speaking to you've
 
05:30:11.270 --> 05:30:11.280 align:start position:0%
been telling stories of people who I
 
05:30:12.708 --> 05:30:12.718 align:start position:0%
suppose you would characterize as
 
05:30:15.230 --> 05:30:15.240 align:start position:0%
rehabilitated which is the purpose of
 
05:30:17.570 --> 05:30:17.580 align:start position:0%
imprisonment according to the state
 
05:30:17.580 --> 05:30:19.430 align:start position:0%
imprisonment according to the state
constitution

05:30:19.430 --> 05:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
05:30:19.440 --> 05:30:20.090 align:start position:0%
constitution
um

05:30:20.090 --> 05:30:20.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:30:22.550 --> 05:30:22.560 align:start position:0%
so I was wondering if you could speak to
 
05:30:25.310 --> 05:30:25.320 align:start position:0%
how you feel if this applies how you
 
05:30:27.170 --> 05:30:27.180 align:start position:0%
feel that their continued imprisonment
 
05:30:29.690 --> 05:30:29.700 align:start position:0%
at the point past the point where
 
05:30:29.700 --> 05:30:30.470 align:start position:0%
at the point past the point where
they're

05:30:30.470 --> 05:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
they're
 
05:30:33.470 --> 05:30:33.480 align:start position:0%
arguably rehabilitated has affected
 
05:30:36.650 --> 05:30:36.660 align:start position:0%
their ability to maintain that state
 
05:30:39.708 --> 05:30:39.718 align:start position:0%
um and if it plays any role in maybe
 
05:30:41.390 --> 05:30:41.400 align:start position:0%
sliding backwards or as you mentioned a
 
05:30:42.830 --> 05:30:42.840 align:start position:0%
moment ago feeling defeated anything
 
05:30:44.390 --> 05:30:44.400 align:start position:0%
along those lines
 
05:30:47.330 --> 05:30:47.340 align:start position:0%
yeah I think when you when you said
 
05:30:50.868 --> 05:30:50.878 align:start position:0%
um alone in a Cell for hours upon end
 
05:30:52.730 --> 05:30:52.740 align:start position:0%
and you know during covid there were
 
05:30:55.128 --> 05:30:55.138 align:start position:0%
people locked down for as long as like
 
05:30:58.190 --> 05:30:58.200 align:start position:0%
43 days that does something to your mind
 
05:30:59.570 --> 05:30:59.580 align:start position:0%
that's not even speaking to people who
 
05:31:01.250 --> 05:31:01.260 align:start position:0%
are who get you know put in the
 
05:31:04.190 --> 05:31:04.200 align:start position:0%
quote-unquote whole where you know you
 
05:31:07.490 --> 05:31:07.500 align:start position:0%
hear them screaming out loud or women
 
05:31:10.250 --> 05:31:10.260 align:start position:0%
who end up in like a bit of a psychosis
 
05:31:13.368 --> 05:31:13.378 align:start position:0%
because I witnessed a woman who was in a
 
05:31:15.230 --> 05:31:15.240 align:start position:0%
padded room for weeks with no sunlight
 
05:31:17.810 --> 05:31:17.820 align:start position:0%
and no fresh air where she was
 
05:31:20.270 --> 05:31:20.280 align:start position:0%
unclothing herself and writing messages
 
05:31:22.430 --> 05:31:22.440 align:start position:0%
on the walls with her feces and her
 
05:31:25.090 --> 05:31:25.100 align:start position:0%
Menses saying help me get me out of here
 
05:31:28.430 --> 05:31:28.440 align:start position:0%
and so yeah I do think that long-term
 
05:31:31.070 --> 05:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
incarceration does something to the
 
05:31:33.410 --> 05:31:33.420 align:start position:0%
human brain I'm not a scientist in that
 
05:31:33.420 --> 05:31:34.128 align:start position:0%
human brain I'm not a scientist in that
way

05:31:34.128 --> 05:31:34.138 align:start position:0%
way
 
05:31:36.708 --> 05:31:36.718 align:start position:0%
um but I do think that it's possible to
 
05:31:38.448 --> 05:31:38.458 align:start position:0%
regress in some of the progress that you
 
05:31:40.128 --> 05:31:40.138 align:start position:0%
might make I I don't know it's probably
 
05:31:42.350 --> 05:31:42.360 align:start position:0%
an individual basis right everyone has a
 
05:31:43.730 --> 05:31:43.740 align:start position:0%
different makeup a different resiliency
 
05:31:47.390 --> 05:31:47.400 align:start position:0%
a different level of um you know wanting
 
05:31:49.850 --> 05:31:49.860 align:start position:0%
to do better when I'm looking at these
 
05:31:51.470 --> 05:31:51.480 align:start position:0%
women that I mentioned to you you know I
 
05:31:54.350 --> 05:31:54.360 align:start position:0%
mean luckily Sam is very spiritual so
 
05:31:56.090 --> 05:31:56.100 align:start position:0%
she prays a lot and she just hopes that
 
05:31:58.128 --> 05:31:58.138 align:start position:0%
it's going to work out in in God's
 
05:32:00.770 --> 05:32:00.780 align:start position:0%
timing I think Nicole just is Relentless
 
05:32:02.448 --> 05:32:02.458 align:start position:0%
and strong and doesn't give up so she's
 
05:32:04.430 --> 05:32:04.440 align:start position:0%
going to keep fighting but you get these
 
05:32:06.170 --> 05:32:06.180 align:start position:0%
setbacks and you go in your cell and you
 
05:32:10.788 --> 05:32:10.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:15.050 --> 05:32:15.060 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
05:32:30.170 --> 05:32:30.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:32.330 --> 05:32:32.340 align:start position:0%
is this on
 
05:32:34.010 --> 05:32:34.020 align:start position:0%
thank you members of the kid committee
 
05:32:36.050 --> 05:32:36.060 align:start position:0%
my name is Joseph lascaz I will be
 
05:32:37.850 --> 05:32:37.860 align:start position:0%
representing the ACLU of New Hampshire
 
05:32:40.430 --> 05:32:40.440 align:start position:0%
in support of this bill I will also be
 
05:32:42.708 --> 05:32:42.718 align:start position:0%
representing myself in a formerly as a
 
05:32:44.448 --> 05:32:44.458 align:start position:0%
formerly incarcerated individual of the
 
05:32:46.730 --> 05:32:46.740 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of Corrections
 
05:32:49.490 --> 05:32:49.500 align:start position:0%
um in in support of this I will also be
 
05:32:50.810 --> 05:32:50.820 align:start position:0%
speaking from the perspective of the
 
05:32:53.150 --> 05:32:53.160 align:start position:0%
individual who mentors both adults and
 
05:32:55.788 --> 05:32:55.798 align:start position:0%
juveniles that are Justice involved in
 
05:32:57.410 --> 05:32:57.420 align:start position:0%
the community from that perspective as
 
05:32:57.420 --> 05:32:59.510 align:start position:0%
the community from that perspective as
well

05:32:59.510 --> 05:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:33:02.448 --> 05:33:02.458 align:start position:0%
uh three years ago what at the start of
 
05:33:04.490 --> 05:33:04.500 align:start position:0%
this bill I've been working on this uh
 
05:33:06.050 --> 05:33:06.060 align:start position:0%
for uh for this bill for three years
 
05:33:09.050 --> 05:33:09.060 align:start position:0%
because there is an issue that is going
 
05:33:10.430 --> 05:33:10.440 align:start position:0%
on at the Department of Corrections when
 
05:33:12.230 --> 05:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
it comes to individuals being able to
 
05:33:15.288 --> 05:33:15.298 align:start position:0%
apply for early release who are ready
 
05:33:17.990 --> 05:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
and deserve it as opposed to who can get
 
05:33:18.000 --> 05:33:18.708 align:start position:0%
and deserve it as opposed to who can get
it

05:33:18.708 --> 05:33:18.718 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:33:20.510 --> 05:33:20.520 align:start position:0%
so the first the first argument that I
 
05:33:22.190 --> 05:33:22.200 align:start position:0%
would like to make involving earn time
 
05:33:24.470 --> 05:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
credit and why this differs from that
 
05:33:26.330 --> 05:33:26.340 align:start position:0%
and why it's needed is earn time credit
 
05:33:29.390 --> 05:33:29.400 align:start position:0%
is not Behavior based we heard we heard
 
05:33:31.250 --> 05:33:31.260 align:start position:0%
testimony that an individual can fake it
 
05:33:32.810 --> 05:33:32.820 align:start position:0%
to they make it
 
05:33:34.670 --> 05:33:34.680 align:start position:0%
under this provision that would not be
 
05:33:36.590 --> 05:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
done because you cannot fake the
 
05:33:38.208 --> 05:33:38.218 align:start position:0%
criteria that are outlined in this bill
 
05:33:40.128 --> 05:33:40.138 align:start position:0%
that is something that you have to do on
 
05:33:42.830 --> 05:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
a daily basis as opposed to being able
 
05:33:45.230 --> 05:33:45.240 align:start position:0%
to just sign up for something or fake it
 
05:33:47.868 --> 05:33:47.878 align:start position:0%
as as in what we heard
 
05:33:49.550 --> 05:33:49.560 align:start position:0%
when truth and sentences was introduced
 
05:33:51.288 --> 05:33:51.298 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire in the 80s there was
 
05:33:53.208 --> 05:33:53.218 align:start position:0%
only 394 people that were currently
 
05:33:55.910 --> 05:33:55.920 align:start position:0%
incarcerated it took over 170 years to
 
05:33:58.430 --> 05:33:58.440 align:start position:0%
reach that number and as soon as truth
 
05:33:59.810 --> 05:33:59.820 align:start position:0%
and sentence was incarcerated over the
 
05:34:02.270 --> 05:34:02.280 align:start position:0%
next 37 years that number quad drupled
 
05:34:04.850 --> 05:34:04.860 align:start position:0%
to over 2 000 where we are still
 
05:34:06.350 --> 05:34:06.360 align:start position:0%
hovering around the numbers have gone
 
05:34:07.670 --> 05:34:07.680 align:start position:0%
down but we are hovering around the
 
05:34:10.010 --> 05:34:10.020 align:start position:0%
numbers after the explosion of Truth and
 
05:34:12.948 --> 05:34:12.958 align:start position:0%
sentencing multiple states have already
 
05:34:14.628 --> 05:34:14.638 align:start position:0%
repealed truth and sentencing and
 
05:34:16.490 --> 05:34:16.500 align:start position:0%
statistically their crime rate has not
 
05:34:16.500 --> 05:34:18.770 align:start position:0%
statistically their crime rate has not
increased

05:34:18.770 --> 05:34:18.780 align:start position:0%
increased
 
05:34:20.570 --> 05:34:20.580 align:start position:0%
we heard some testimony about the
 
05:34:22.610 --> 05:34:22.620 align:start position:0%
individuals who would be released under
 
05:34:24.770 --> 05:34:24.780 align:start position:0%
truth and sentencing and if these are
 
05:34:28.730 --> 05:34:28.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:30.770 --> 05:34:30.780 align:start position:0%
I myself was formerly incarcerated on
 
05:34:32.330 --> 05:34:32.340 align:start position:0%
violent charges of armed robbery things
 
05:34:34.250 --> 05:34:34.260 align:start position:0%
that I am not proud of I was 17 years
 
05:34:37.368 --> 05:34:37.378 align:start position:0%
old I made very poor choices
 
05:34:39.948 --> 05:34:39.958 align:start position:0%
I spent my time I did I did my time I
 
05:34:41.750 --> 05:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
made different choices during that
 
05:34:44.030 --> 05:34:44.040 align:start position:0%
incarceration and I was released since
 
05:34:47.270 --> 05:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
then I work in court diversion programs
 
05:34:49.128 --> 05:34:49.138 align:start position:0%
for juveniles where I keep them out of
 
05:34:51.050 --> 05:34:51.060 align:start position:0%
the system by working with Manchester
 
05:34:53.510 --> 05:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
juvenile probation parole major police
 
05:34:55.788 --> 05:34:55.798 align:start position:0%
athletically where we Mentor these kids
 
05:34:58.788 --> 05:34:58.798 align:start position:0%
where we use our experiences to show
 
05:35:00.470 --> 05:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
them a different path this was
 
05:35:02.510 --> 05:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
recognized to the point where even where
 
05:35:04.430 --> 05:35:04.440 align:start position:0%
a New Hampshire judge has released an
 
05:35:06.708 --> 05:35:06.718 align:start position:0%
individual to the supervision of the
 
05:35:08.810 --> 05:35:08.820 align:start position:0%
program that I oversee because they saw
 
05:35:10.788 --> 05:35:10.798 align:start position:0%
a better benefit to a person who was
 
05:35:13.010 --> 05:35:13.020 align:start position:0%
rehabilitated using their experience to
 
05:35:15.770 --> 05:35:15.780 align:start position:0%
combat Street violence and gang gang and
 
05:35:17.690 --> 05:35:17.700 align:start position:0%
entering into gangs than to keep them
 
05:35:19.850 --> 05:35:19.860 align:start position:0%
locked in a Cell where they're just
 
05:35:22.310 --> 05:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
rotting away
 
05:35:23.930 --> 05:35:23.940 align:start position:0%
there is such a low percentage of
 
05:35:26.288 --> 05:35:26.298 align:start position:0%
individuals who go up for their 65120
 
05:35:29.270 --> 05:35:29.280 align:start position:0%
that this provision right here sort of
 
05:35:31.730 --> 05:35:31.740 align:start position:0%
evens the playing field and this is not
 
05:35:34.250 --> 05:35:34.260 align:start position:0%
a census modification this does not
 
05:35:36.230 --> 05:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
apply to the sentencing part of law this
 
05:35:38.810 --> 05:35:38.820 align:start position:0%
only applies to the parole eligibility
 
05:35:40.610 --> 05:35:40.620 align:start position:0%
of the parole eligibility part of the
 
05:35:43.730 --> 05:35:43.740 align:start position:0%
law which the parole board it is their
 
05:35:46.970 --> 05:35:46.980 align:start position:0%
duty to deem an individual as safe and
 
05:35:50.448 --> 05:35:50.458 align:start position:0%
rehabilitated as we just heard if the
 
05:35:51.890 --> 05:35:51.900 align:start position:0%
parole board was was releasing
 
05:35:53.510 --> 05:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
individuals who were not rehabilitated
 
05:35:54.948 --> 05:35:54.958 align:start position:0%
or safe then they would be held liable
 
05:35:56.990 --> 05:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
for the actions of individuals once they
 
05:35:58.730 --> 05:35:58.740 align:start position:0%
are released and that's not the case so
 
05:36:00.770 --> 05:36:00.780 align:start position:0%
there's a reason why we have that in
 
05:36:03.110 --> 05:36:03.120 align:start position:0%
place and this provision only puts
 
05:36:04.850 --> 05:36:04.860 align:start position:0%
people in front of them with an
 
05:36:06.350 --> 05:36:06.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity for them to make an
 
05:36:08.090 --> 05:36:08.100 align:start position:0%
assessment of whether or not they're
 
05:36:10.430 --> 05:36:10.440 align:start position:0%
ready I just wanted to talk about why
 
05:36:12.708 --> 05:36:12.718 align:start position:0%
this was put to why the amendment said
 
05:36:15.530 --> 05:36:15.540 align:start position:0%
seven and a half years on on page one or
 
05:36:20.208 --> 05:36:20.218 align:start position:0%
page two I guess uh uh line six uh uh
 
05:36:22.550 --> 05:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
subpart a the person was sentenced to a
 
05:36:25.070 --> 05:36:25.080 align:start position:0%
minimum of not less than five years
 
05:36:27.410 --> 05:36:27.420 align:start position:0%
currently the the average minimum
 
05:36:29.270 --> 05:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
sentence that an individual gets at the
 
05:36:30.890 --> 05:36:30.900 align:start position:0%
Department of Correction is three and a
 
05:36:33.110 --> 05:36:33.120 align:start position:0%
half years that is without this
 
05:36:34.788 --> 05:36:34.798 align:start position:0%
provision they get a minimum three and a
 
05:36:36.050 --> 05:36:36.060 align:start position:0%
half years that's the average sentence
 
05:36:36.060 --> 05:36:37.550 align:start position:0%
half years that's the average sentence
so

05:36:37.550 --> 05:36:37.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:36:39.110 --> 05:36:39.120 align:start position:0%
after working with the Department of
 
05:36:40.788 --> 05:36:40.798 align:start position:0%
Corrections and other stakeholders on
 
05:36:42.530 --> 05:36:42.540 align:start position:0%
this provision we came to the conclusion
 
05:36:44.750 --> 05:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
that five years was not enough time for
 
05:36:47.510 --> 05:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
an individual to be able to complete all
 
05:36:50.150 --> 05:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
court ordered programs doc required
 
05:36:53.750 --> 05:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
programs as well as get ready to to form
 
05:36:55.910 --> 05:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
their transition back into society so
 
05:36:57.590 --> 05:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
that number was put up to seven and a
 
05:37:00.110 --> 05:37:00.120 align:start position:0%
half years which if they even did fit
 
05:37:01.970 --> 05:37:01.980 align:start position:0%
the criterias of that were outlined in
 
05:37:04.368 --> 05:37:04.378 align:start position:0%
the bill and the parole board did decide
 
05:37:06.470 --> 05:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
to grant them they still would be doing
 
05:37:08.570 --> 05:37:08.580 align:start position:0%
the average amount of time that an
 
05:37:10.670 --> 05:37:10.680 align:start position:0%
individual currently is sentenced to the
 
05:37:13.070 --> 05:37:13.080 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections
 
05:37:15.410 --> 05:37:15.420 align:start position:0%
the person has no major or a-level
 
05:37:17.930 --> 05:37:17.940 align:start position:0%
disciplinary violation an a-level
 
05:37:20.930 --> 05:37:20.940 align:start position:0%
offenses attempted Escape assault on a
 
05:37:22.490 --> 05:37:22.500 align:start position:0%
correctional officer institutional
 
05:37:25.070 --> 05:37:25.080 align:start position:0%
murder rape drug dealing inside for
 
05:37:28.190 --> 05:37:28.200 align:start position:0%
those are the type of offenses that are
 
05:37:30.770 --> 05:37:30.780 align:start position:0%
categorically restricted from being able
 
05:37:33.890 --> 05:37:33.900 align:start position:0%
to parole from under hip
 
05:37:35.810 --> 05:37:35.820 align:start position:0%
the retroactive portion of this was
 
05:37:37.070 --> 05:37:37.080 align:start position:0%
something that was taken out because
 
05:37:38.330 --> 05:37:38.340 align:start position:0%
what we wanted to do was take into
 
05:37:40.310 --> 05:37:40.320 align:start position:0%
concerns that take into account the
 
05:37:42.110 --> 05:37:42.120 align:start position:0%
concerns of every individual including
 
05:37:43.730 --> 05:37:43.740 align:start position:0%
those of the victims who did not want to
 
05:37:45.770 --> 05:37:45.780 align:start position:0%
have to be re-victimized by going back
 
05:37:48.170 --> 05:37:48.180 align:start position:0%
to court so the retroactive portion
 
05:37:49.730 --> 05:37:49.740 align:start position:0%
would be taken out and what that would
 
05:37:51.830 --> 05:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
do is it would be something that would
 
05:37:54.410 --> 05:37:54.420 align:start position:0%
be going forward as in the earn time
 
05:37:57.590 --> 05:37:57.600 align:start position:0%
credits and the 65120 that people are
 
05:38:00.650 --> 05:38:00.660 align:start position:0%
aware of when they apply for parole
 
05:38:03.350 --> 05:38:03.360 align:start position:0%
in closing I just want to say that many
 
05:38:05.090 --> 05:38:05.100 align:start position:0%
individuals in this Committee in this
 
05:38:06.590 --> 05:38:06.600 align:start position:0%
room they know me they know the changes
 
05:38:07.910 --> 05:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
that I've made they know the things that
 
05:38:10.730 --> 05:38:10.740 align:start position:0%
I'm doing in this in in the state for
 
05:38:11.868 --> 05:38:11.878 align:start position:0%
the benefit
 
05:38:15.590 --> 05:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
if that is not deemed to be a value or
 
05:38:17.570 --> 05:38:17.580 align:start position:0%
of a benefit to the community if the
 
05:38:20.628 --> 05:38:20.638 align:start position:0%
individuals I ask you come with me on a
 
05:38:22.490 --> 05:38:22.500 align:start position:0%
Wednesday night to Manchester and see
 
05:38:24.230 --> 05:38:24.240 align:start position:0%
the difference that the individuals with
 
05:38:27.110 --> 05:38:27.120 align:start position:0%
lived experience are making in the in in
 
05:38:30.288 --> 05:38:30.298 align:start position:0%
youth to stop future victimization to
 
05:38:32.990 --> 05:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
start future problems the criteria that
 
05:38:34.850 --> 05:38:34.860 align:start position:0%
are outlined in this bill are the
 
05:38:37.310 --> 05:38:37.320 align:start position:0%
criteria that if someone makes that that
 
05:38:39.350 --> 05:38:39.360 align:start position:0%
is someone who deserves to be back in
 
05:38:41.750 --> 05:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
the the community we sentence people to
 
05:38:43.730 --> 05:38:43.740 align:start position:0%
a Department of Corrections not a
 
05:38:45.288 --> 05:38:45.298 align:start position:0%
department of punishment because there
 
05:38:46.910 --> 05:38:46.920 align:start position:0%
is a difference we are trying to correct
 
05:38:48.708 --> 05:38:48.718 align:start position:0%
the behavior of individuals who are
 
05:38:50.628 --> 05:38:50.638 align:start position:0%
coming back home and the way to do that
 
05:38:53.628 --> 05:38:53.638 align:start position:0%
is to incentivize that on a daily basis
 
05:38:55.430 --> 05:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
happy to take any and all questions that
 
05:38:59.570 --> 05:38:59.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:03.110 --> 05:39:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:03.120 --> 05:39:05.270 align:start position:0%
 
I

05:39:05.270 --> 05:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
I
 
05:39:07.250 --> 05:39:07.260 align:start position:0%
I just want to pose the same question to
 
05:39:09.650 --> 05:39:09.660 align:start position:0%
you that I asked of the last speaker
 
05:39:09.660 --> 05:39:10.850 align:start position:0%
you that I asked of the last speaker
about

05:39:10.850 --> 05:39:10.860 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:39:10.860 --> 05:39:11.628 align:start position:0%
about
um

05:39:11.628 --> 05:39:11.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:39:16.490 --> 05:39:16.500 align:start position:0%
if when you were incarcerated or in your
 
05:39:18.830 --> 05:39:18.840 align:start position:0%
time since leaving
 
05:39:21.350 --> 05:39:21.360 align:start position:0%
um if you've observed any instances in
 
05:39:23.990 --> 05:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
which someone was affected detrimentally
 
05:39:25.970 --> 05:39:25.980 align:start position:0%
by continuing to be incarcerated after
 
05:39:28.610 --> 05:39:28.620 align:start position:0%
they were probably
 
05:39:28.620 --> 05:39:29.750 align:start position:0%
they were probably
um

05:39:29.750 --> 05:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:39:29.760 --> 05:39:35.270 align:start position:0%
um
rehabilitated

05:39:35.270 --> 05:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:37.970 --> 05:39:37.980 align:start position:0%
let me think of one that did so there
 
05:39:40.310 --> 05:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
was an individual in New Hampshire he
 
05:39:41.868 --> 05:39:41.878 align:start position:0%
was an 18 year old he was an 18 year old
 
05:39:41.878 --> 05:39:42.948 align:start position:0%
was an 18 year old he was an 18 year old
kid

05:39:42.948 --> 05:39:42.958 align:start position:0%
kid
 
05:39:44.990 --> 05:39:45.000 align:start position:0%
never once ever been arrested in his
 
05:39:47.270 --> 05:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
life he was the first person in his
 
05:39:48.948 --> 05:39:48.958 align:start position:0%
entire family to be arrested his mother
 
05:39:51.170 --> 05:39:51.180 align:start position:0%
is the CEO of a Fortune 500 company out
 
05:39:52.310 --> 05:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
of Canada
 
05:39:53.990 --> 05:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
he was driving with his friends on a
 
05:39:55.970 --> 05:39:55.980 align:start position:0%
highway they were all going to uh they
 
05:39:58.070 --> 05:39:58.080 align:start position:0%
were going out to eat and they were dry
 
05:40:00.890 --> 05:40:00.900 align:start position:0%
he was driving and just young kid he he
 
05:40:03.050 --> 05:40:03.060 align:start position:0%
missed his exit so he tried to pull a
 
05:40:04.368 --> 05:40:04.378 align:start position:0%
move on the highway to get on to the
 
05:40:06.830 --> 05:40:06.840 align:start position:0%
next one hit a person
 
05:40:08.510 --> 05:40:08.520 align:start position:0%
um and he wasn't Under the Influence or
 
05:40:09.590 --> 05:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
anything he just made a poor judgment
 
05:40:11.750 --> 05:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
call the person and losing delay he was
 
05:40:13.970 --> 05:40:13.980 align:start position:0%
sentenced uh he he was sentenced to a
 
05:40:16.070 --> 05:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
manslaughter charge where he got a
 
05:40:17.750 --> 05:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
15-year sentence
 
05:40:19.970 --> 05:40:19.980 align:start position:0%
and this kid from the day that he came
 
05:40:21.050 --> 05:40:21.060 align:start position:0%
in you could tell that this person was
 
05:40:22.970 --> 05:40:22.980 align:start position:0%
nasty he
 
05:40:24.770 --> 05:40:24.780 align:start position:0%
he committed an offense and what he did
 
05:40:27.110 --> 05:40:27.120 align:start position:0%
was wrong and horrible but a prison
 
05:40:29.030 --> 05:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
environment was not the environment for
 
05:40:31.310 --> 05:40:31.320 align:start position:0%
this kid because within months of him
 
05:40:33.890 --> 05:40:33.900 align:start position:0%
being there he was he had no Direction
 
05:40:36.530 --> 05:40:36.540 align:start position:0%
no guidance was scared
 
05:40:39.110 --> 05:40:39.120 align:start position:0%
and after time got swallowed up into the
 
05:40:41.510 --> 05:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
criminalized mentality
 
05:40:43.910 --> 05:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
um that that goes on in that environment
 
05:40:46.070 --> 05:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
he came in uh
 
05:40:48.230 --> 05:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
on the straight and narrow and when I
 
05:40:50.208 --> 05:40:50.218 align:start position:0%
left was already being recruited by
 
05:40:53.090 --> 05:40:53.100 align:start position:0%
gangs was already getting high in prison
 
05:40:56.690 --> 05:40:56.700 align:start position:0%
was holding on to drugs and that story
 
05:40:59.448 --> 05:40:59.458 align:start position:0%
happens all the time I
 
05:41:01.490 --> 05:41:01.500 align:start position:0%
the first five years of my bid I was not
 
05:41:04.490 --> 05:41:04.500 align:start position:0%
who I am right now in this room if I had
 
05:41:06.590 --> 05:41:06.600 align:start position:0%
been if if I had the opportunity the
 
05:41:08.628 --> 05:41:08.638 align:start position:0%
first time uh you know maybe things
 
05:41:09.708 --> 05:41:09.718 align:start position:0%
would have been different I can't I
 
05:41:11.810 --> 05:41:11.820 align:start position:0%
don't know but what ends up happening is
 
05:41:13.550 --> 05:41:13.560 align:start position:0%
when a person hits a certain point where
 
05:41:16.430 --> 05:41:16.440 align:start position:0%
they are no longer actively engaging in
 
05:41:17.868 --> 05:41:17.878 align:start position:0%
criminal Behavior so they have now made
 
05:41:19.788 --> 05:41:19.798 align:start position:0%
a choice like I am like this is not the
 
05:41:20.990 --> 05:41:21.000 align:start position:0%
lifestyle I want
 
05:41:23.510 --> 05:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
when you have to sit in an environment
 
05:41:25.490 --> 05:41:25.500 align:start position:0%
where everything else is going that
 
05:41:27.650 --> 05:41:27.660 align:start position:0%
opposite direction where you are treated
 
05:41:29.510 --> 05:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
as if you are going in that opposite
 
05:41:32.150 --> 05:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
direction that can break down also it
 
05:41:34.550 --> 05:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
makes you a magnet because you are no
 
05:41:35.990 --> 05:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
longer the same as everyone else prison
 
05:41:38.510 --> 05:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
as a predator or prey environment that's
 
05:41:40.010 --> 05:41:40.020 align:start position:0%
it simple and plain and when a person
 
05:41:41.628 --> 05:41:41.638 align:start position:0%
chooses that they are no longer going to
 
05:41:43.970 --> 05:41:43.980 align:start position:0%
do that other people will then start to
 
05:41:45.708 --> 05:41:45.718 align:start position:0%
try to victimize that person because
 
05:41:47.448 --> 05:41:47.458 align:start position:0%
they're like why aren't you doing the
 
05:41:53.628 --> 05:41:53.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:55.250 --> 05:41:55.260 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler thank you Mr
 
05:41:56.930 --> 05:41:56.940 align:start position:0%
chair and I'll try to be as quick as I
 
05:41:56.940 --> 05:41:57.890 align:start position:0%
chair and I'll try to be as quick as I
can

05:41:57.890 --> 05:41:57.900 align:start position:0%
can
 
05:41:59.690 --> 05:41:59.700 align:start position:0%
um what is the difference in your view
 
05:42:01.190 --> 05:42:01.200 align:start position:0%
as someone who has had first-hand
 
05:42:03.948 --> 05:42:03.958 align:start position:0%
experience with this between the law as
 
05:42:06.410 --> 05:42:06.420 align:start position:0%
it would be in HB 58 if it was passed
 
05:42:08.208 --> 05:42:08.218 align:start position:0%
and the current early release programs
 
05:42:09.170 --> 05:42:09.180 align:start position:0%
that are in the Department of
 
05:42:09.180 --> 05:42:10.670 align:start position:0%
that are in the Department of
Corrections

05:42:10.670 --> 05:42:10.680 align:start position:0%
Corrections
 
05:42:12.050 --> 05:42:12.060 align:start position:0%
that's a great question um
 
05:42:13.970 --> 05:42:13.980 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler so the other
 
05:42:15.530 --> 05:42:15.540 align:start position:0%
programs that are currently in the
 
05:42:17.090 --> 05:42:17.100 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections that
 
05:42:19.850 --> 05:42:19.860 align:start position:0%
um allow for early release they do not
 
05:42:22.610 --> 05:42:22.620 align:start position:0%
apply to everyone categorically so for
 
05:42:25.250 --> 05:42:25.260 align:start position:0%
instance uh they St that you can get up
 
05:42:27.708 --> 05:42:27.718 align:start position:0%
to 21 months if you do college classes
 
05:42:29.930 --> 05:42:29.940 align:start position:0%
not everyone has the economic means of
 
05:42:31.850 --> 05:42:31.860 align:start position:0%
taking college classes
 
05:42:33.470 --> 05:42:33.480 align:start position:0%
some of the some of the earn time credit
 
05:42:35.930 --> 05:42:35.940 align:start position:0%
uh there's their specific criteria for
 
05:42:38.030 --> 05:42:38.040 align:start position:0%
applying for earn time credit and so for
 
05:42:39.708 --> 05:42:39.718 align:start position:0%
instance the family connection center
 
05:42:42.170 --> 05:42:42.180 align:start position:0%
offers a program when I was incarcerated
 
05:42:43.368 --> 05:42:43.378 align:start position:0%
I couldn't do the family connection
 
05:42:45.590 --> 05:42:45.600 align:start position:0%
program because I don't have kids
 
05:42:47.628 --> 05:42:47.638 align:start position:0%
the mental health department offers
 
05:42:49.788 --> 05:42:49.798 align:start position:0%
programs that individuals could do that
 
05:42:51.650 --> 05:42:51.660 align:start position:0%
to get earn time credit when I went and
 
05:42:52.910 --> 05:42:52.920 align:start position:0%
got a mental health assessment they said
 
05:42:54.170 --> 05:42:54.180 align:start position:0%
I did not have a mental health problem
 
05:42:55.788 --> 05:42:55.798 align:start position:0%
so I could not do the mental health
 
05:42:55.798 --> 05:42:57.470 align:start position:0%
so I could not do the mental health
classes

05:42:57.470 --> 05:42:57.480 align:start position:0%
classes
 
05:42:58.970 --> 05:42:58.980 align:start position:0%
I already went to prison with a high
 
05:43:00.110 --> 05:43:00.120 align:start position:0%
school diploma which meant that I could
 
05:43:01.310 --> 05:43:01.320 align:start position:0%
not get their own time credit from doing
 
05:43:03.350 --> 05:43:03.360 align:start position:0%
a high school diploma class or I mean
 
05:43:06.110 --> 05:43:06.120 align:start position:0%
high school credit class or the high set
 
05:43:08.090 --> 05:43:08.100 align:start position:0%
class which meant that the only way that
 
05:43:10.070 --> 05:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
I could get earned time credit was
 
05:43:12.288 --> 05:43:12.298 align:start position:0%
paying for a college degree and that
 
05:43:13.670 --> 05:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
does not seem like earning it that seems
 
05:43:15.788 --> 05:43:15.798 align:start position:0%
like buying it
 
05:43:19.010 --> 05:43:19.020 align:start position:0%
this provision in HP 588 what this does
 
05:43:21.170 --> 05:43:21.180 align:start position:0%
is this is on a daily basis from the
 
05:43:22.368 --> 05:43:22.378 align:start position:0%
moment you wake up to when you go to
 
05:43:24.890 --> 05:43:24.900 align:start position:0%
sleep each day you have to behave a
 
05:43:27.230 --> 05:43:27.240 align:start position:0%
specific way which in my opinion as a
 
05:43:28.430 --> 05:43:28.440 align:start position:0%
person who was formerly encouraged and
 
05:43:30.110 --> 05:43:30.120 align:start position:0%
gone through this that is the only way
 
05:43:31.610 --> 05:43:31.620 align:start position:0%
to form the habits that we're looking
 
05:43:33.530 --> 05:43:33.540 align:start position:0%
for for people to make right judgments
 
05:43:35.150 --> 05:43:35.160 align:start position:0%
right it's from habit the reason why you
 
05:43:36.550 --> 05:43:36.560 align:start position:0%
can tie your shoes
 
05:43:38.510 --> 05:43:38.520 align:start position:0%
blindfolded is because you've done it so
 
05:43:40.128 --> 05:43:40.138 align:start position:0%
many times it becomes a habit that's
 
05:43:41.330 --> 05:43:41.340 align:start position:0%
what we're looking to do we're trying to
 
05:43:43.448 --> 05:43:43.458 align:start position:0%
make people we're trying to establish
 
05:43:45.948 --> 05:43:45.958 align:start position:0%
individuals making healthy choices where
 
05:43:48.048 --> 05:43:48.058 align:start position:0%
it is a habit where it becomes easy to
 
05:43:50.150 --> 05:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
make the right choice I know that we're
 
05:43:51.890 --> 05:43:51.900 align:start position:0%
like why are we rewarding people for
 
05:43:53.868 --> 05:43:53.878 align:start position:0%
making the right choice no the
 
05:43:56.750 --> 05:43:56.760 align:start position:0%
individuals that are eligible for this
 
05:43:58.430 --> 05:43:58.440 align:start position:0%
did not make a right choice to begin
 
05:43:59.930 --> 05:43:59.940 align:start position:0%
with so that means they did not think
 
05:44:01.430 --> 05:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
the way that we are trying to get them
 
05:44:03.708 --> 05:44:03.718 align:start position:0%
to think which comes from repetitious
 
05:44:03.718 --> 05:44:05.330 align:start position:0%
to think which comes from repetitious
Behavior

05:44:05.330 --> 05:44:05.340 align:start position:0%
Behavior
 
05:44:07.610 --> 05:44:07.620 align:start position:0%
that's outlined in this bill

159 18.
 
05:49:35.090 --> 05:49:35.100 align:start position:0%
it uses the same definition
 
05:49:37.788 --> 05:49:37.798 align:start position:0%
of the ammunition I didn't want to make
 
05:49:39.530 --> 05:49:39.540 align:start position:0%
it very complex
 
05:49:41.830 --> 05:49:41.840 align:start position:0%
all at the old Bill
 
05:49:45.110 --> 05:49:45.120 align:start position:0%
159 18
 
05:49:49.730 --> 05:49:49.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:54.128 --> 05:49:54.138 align:start position:0%
it being a criminal issue if
 
05:49:57.890 --> 05:49:57.900 align:start position:0%
armor-piercing ammunition was used
 
05:49:59.448 --> 05:49:59.458 align:start position:0%
in the committing of a crime a
 
05:50:02.150 --> 05:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor felony it was considered to
 
05:50:03.830 --> 05:50:03.840 align:start position:0%
be a misdemeanor for that
 
05:50:06.890 --> 05:50:06.900 align:start position:0%
I simply changed the language
 
05:50:09.048 --> 05:50:09.058 align:start position:0%
to say that
 
05:50:11.270 --> 05:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
the same ammo using the same definition
 
05:50:13.730 --> 05:50:13.740 align:start position:0%

05:50:25.490 --> 05:50:25.500 align:start position:0%
intended that's the important part
 
05:50:28.970 --> 05:50:28.980 align:start position:0%
designed and intended to penetrate armor
 
05:50:31.970 --> 05:50:31.980 align:start position:0%
plating or ballistic vests
 
05:50:34.128 --> 05:50:34.138 align:start position:0%

05:50:37.788 --> 05:50:37.798 align:start position:0%
all it's all about safety uh that's
 
05:50:40.190 --> 05:50:40.200 align:start position:0%
always been my mantra
 
05:50:42.770 --> 05:50:42.780 align:start position:0%
representative Rhodes you uh came before
 
05:50:44.270 --> 05:50:44.280 align:start position:0%

safety issue I immediately uh
 
05:50:49.910 --> 05:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
woke up to that and said that's a good
 
05:50:52.548 --> 05:50:52.558 align:start position:0%
one and uh I'm glad I'm glad you brought
 
05:50:56.868 --> 05:50:56.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:56.878 --> 05:50:59.390 align:start position:0%
 
now

05:50:59.390 --> 05:50:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:01.670 --> 05:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
I think one of you are about to ask
 
05:51:03.830 --> 05:51:03.840 align:start position:0%
uh what other states have
 
05:51:05.810 --> 05:51:05.820 align:start position:0%
this kind of
 
05:51:09.788 --> 05:51:09.798 align:start position:0%
statutes it's uh Alabama California
 
05:51:13.368 --> 05:51:13.378 align:start position:0%
Connecticut DC Florida
 
05:51:19.368 --> 05:51:19.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:21.110 --> 05:51:21.120 align:start position:0%
all of them have
 
05:51:23.150 --> 05:51:23.160 align:start position:0%
all of them have statutes they're all
 
05:51:24.470 --> 05:51:24.480 align:start position:0%
very complex
 
05:51:26.570 --> 05:51:26.580 align:start position:0%
the one I wrote is much more user
 
05:51:26.580 --> 05:51:29.990 align:start position:0%
the one I wrote is much more user
friendly

05:51:29.990 --> 05:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:34.430 --> 05:51:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:36.948 --> 05:51:36.958 align:start position:0%
I can want to say audience because I'm
 
05:51:38.030 --> 05:51:38.040 align:start position:0%
used to the city
 
05:51:39.590 --> 05:51:39.600 align:start position:0%
um keep one in California statute
 
05:51:43.548 --> 05:51:43.558 align:start position:0%
because that was a reactive statue in
 
05:51:46.010 --> 05:51:46.020 align:start position:0%
Palm Springs California
 
05:51:47.690 --> 05:51:47.700 align:start position:0%
it was a perpetrator
 
05:51:50.690 --> 05:51:50.700 align:start position:0%
who sat in his house called the police
 
05:51:52.368 --> 05:51:52.378 align:start position:0%
through his house because he said he had
 
05:51:55.788 --> 05:51:55.798 align:start position:0%
an emergency when they got there
 
05:51:58.070 --> 05:51:58.080 align:start position:0%
he shot through the door
 
05:51:59.990 --> 05:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
these these three police officers were
 
05:52:02.628 --> 05:52:02.638 align:start position:0%
wearing protective vests he shot through
 
05:52:04.190 --> 05:52:04.200 align:start position:0%
the door
 
05:52:06.470 --> 05:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
killing two police officers and injuring
 
05:52:06.480 --> 05:52:08.868 align:start position:0%
killing two police officers and injuring
another

05:52:08.868 --> 05:52:08.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:10.970 --> 05:52:10.980 align:start position:0%
which is one of the reasons why I'm not
 
05:52:13.670 --> 05:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
sure why we need these vests
 
05:52:13.680 --> 05:52:16.310 align:start position:0%
sure why we need these vests
um

05:52:16.310 --> 05:52:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:19.548 --> 05:52:19.558 align:start position:0%
and so you ask what is the federal law
 
05:52:21.350 --> 05:52:21.360 align:start position:0%
the federal law
 
05:52:24.948 --> 05:52:24.958 align:start position:0%
about this this people 18 or over can
 
05:52:28.430 --> 05:52:28.440 align:start position:0%
buy shotgun or rifle ammunition only
 
05:52:31.190 --> 05:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
all other ammunition can be
 
05:52:34.310 --> 05:52:34.320 align:start position:0%
can be sold only to people 21 or over
 
05:52:36.410 --> 05:52:36.420 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
05:52:40.010 --> 05:52:40.020 align:start position:0%
in the eyes of the federal people there
 
05:52:41.750 --> 05:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
has to be some protection also otherwise
 
05:52:43.788 --> 05:52:43.798 align:start position:0%
they would have let 18 year olds buy
 
05:52:46.670 --> 05:52:46.680 align:start position:0%
that same ammunition
 
05:52:48.410 --> 05:52:48.420 align:start position:0%
we're all familiar with some of the
 
05:52:51.288 --> 05:52:51.298 align:start position:0%
recent shootings
 
05:52:55.250 --> 05:52:55.260 align:start position:0%
the uh school shooting in Texas
 
05:52:57.890 --> 05:52:57.900 align:start position:0%
I believe 17 children and two
 
05:53:01.670 --> 05:53:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:03.770 --> 05:53:03.780 align:start position:0%
the perpetrator there
 
05:53:06.350 --> 05:53:06.360 align:start position:0%
he bought he went out and bought
 
05:53:08.628 --> 05:53:08.638 align:start position:0%
over 5000 rounds of ammunition from a
 
05:53:13.430 --> 05:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:15.530 --> 05:53:15.540 align:start position:0%
when that incident happened it took a
 
05:53:16.910 --> 05:53:16.920 align:start position:0%
couple days
 
05:53:19.510 --> 05:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
for them to identify the bodies because
 
05:53:22.970 --> 05:53:22.980 align:start position:0%
he used such ammunition and they had to
 
05:53:25.910 --> 05:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
do DNA because they were picking up arms
 
05:53:28.010 --> 05:53:28.020 align:start position:0%
and heads and legs from all over the
 
05:53:30.230 --> 05:53:30.240 align:start position:0%
place and they had them match them up
 
05:53:32.208 --> 05:53:32.218 align:start position:0%
with the Torso because that's what this
 
05:53:34.610 --> 05:53:34.620 align:start position:0%
ammunition does and that's what I'm
 
05:53:44.030 --> 05:53:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:45.948 --> 05:53:45.958 align:start position:0%
the most horrendous shooting incident
 
05:53:48.590 --> 05:53:48.600 align:start position:0%
ever happened in the U.S was in Las
 
05:53:51.170 --> 05:53:51.180 align:start position:0%
Vegas where the perpetrator and I'm
 
05:53:53.330 --> 05:53:53.340 align:start position:0%
being nice calling him a perpetrator
 
05:53:56.990 --> 05:53:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:59.150 --> 05:53:59.160 align:start position:0%
he bought over 60 000 rounds of
 
05:54:01.610 --> 05:54:01.620 align:start position:0%
armor-piercing ammo
 
05:54:04.190 --> 05:54:04.200 align:start position:0%
and an Arizona gun show
 
05:54:06.470 --> 05:54:06.480 align:start position:0%
so he bought that and no flags were
 
05:54:06.480 --> 05:54:10.010 align:start position:0%
so he bought that and no flags were
raised

05:54:10.010 --> 05:54:10.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:12.230 --> 05:54:12.240 align:start position:0%
I'd call this to protect our police bill
 
05:54:14.570 --> 05:54:14.580 align:start position:0%
because I'm worried about our police I
 
05:54:16.190 --> 05:54:16.200 align:start position:0%
think they need our protection I think
 
05:54:17.690 --> 05:54:17.700 align:start position:0%
every one of you should be able to go
 
05:54:19.490 --> 05:54:19.500 align:start position:0%
home and tell your local police
 
05:54:22.070 --> 05:54:22.080 align:start position:0%
department I want to protect you
 
05:54:27.948 --> 05:54:27.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:30.230 --> 05:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
Banks and retailers are all now starting
 
05:54:32.270 --> 05:54:32.280 align:start position:0%
to put in bulletproof partitions because
 
05:54:34.368 --> 05:54:34.378 align:start position:0%
they want to protect
 
05:54:36.288 --> 05:54:36.298 align:start position:0%
their employees
 
05:54:38.868 --> 05:54:38.878 align:start position:0%
I think it's up to us to pass this bill
 
05:54:42.470 --> 05:54:42.480 align:start position:0%
and help them protect your employees
 
05:54:45.590 --> 05:54:45.600 align:start position:0%
School design Architects are now being
 
05:54:46.910 --> 05:54:46.920 align:start position:0%
very creative
 
05:54:49.548 --> 05:54:49.558 align:start position:0%
they're creating protective enclosures
 
05:54:52.070 --> 05:54:52.080 align:start position:0%
that go in the back of a classroom maybe
 
05:54:54.770 --> 05:54:54.780 align:start position:0%
maybe the size of 12 by 10
 
05:54:56.390 --> 05:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
. uh they're being very creative they're
 
05:54:58.548 --> 05:54:58.558 align:start position:0%
making a mean to either a code closet or
 
05:55:03.410 --> 05:55:03.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:07.730 --> 05:55:07.740 align:start position:0%
and it's a place for students to go and
 
05:55:11.208 --> 05:55:11.218 align:start position:0%
hide if they need to once again
 
05:55:13.850 --> 05:55:13.860 align:start position:0%
it's bulletproof but it wouldn't be
 
05:55:18.048 --> 05:55:18.058 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:18.058 --> 05:55:24.470 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

05:55:24.470 --> 05:55:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:27.530 --> 05:55:27.540 align:start position:0%
I'm very much open to questions I just
 
05:55:29.270 --> 05:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
want to make it clear that
 
05:55:30.890 --> 05:55:30.900 align:start position:0%
because there's been I know you've all
 
05:55:33.170 --> 05:55:33.180 align:start position:0%
received a lot of emails this is not
 
05:55:35.390 --> 05:55:35.400 align:start position:0%
about a gun bill at all I'm not changing
 
05:55:38.090 --> 05:55:38.100 align:start position:0%
trying to control guns or change guns
 
05:55:41.030 --> 05:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
this is about safety police safety
 
05:55:44.628 --> 05:55:44.638 align:start position:0%
children safety worker safety and that's
 
05:55:46.730 --> 05:55:46.740 align:start position:0%
what I'm all about
 
05:55:49.010 --> 05:55:49.020 align:start position:0%
and I'll gladly answer any questions if
 
05:55:51.170 --> 05:55:51.180 align:start position:0%
the committee has any Mr chairman thank
 
05:55:51.180 --> 05:55:52.250 align:start position:0%
the committee has any Mr chairman thank
you

05:55:52.250 --> 05:55:52.260 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:55:52.260 --> 05:55:52.910 align:start position:0%
you
um

05:55:52.910 --> 05:55:52.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:55:54.650 --> 05:55:54.660 align:start position:0%
could you tell me specifically what
 
05:55:56.330 --> 05:55:56.340 align:start position:0%
ammunition that I could purchase today
 
05:56:00.530 --> 05:56:00.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:06.590 --> 05:56:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:10.070 --> 05:56:10.080 align:start position:0%
any anything it's a generalized
 
05:56:13.430 --> 05:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
definition anything that's designed or
 
05:56:13.440 --> 05:56:15.110 align:start position:0%
definition anything that's designed or
intended

05:56:15.110 --> 05:56:15.120 align:start position:0%
intended
 
05:56:19.310 --> 05:56:19.320 align:start position:0%
to uh Pierce body performer
 
05:56:21.590 --> 05:56:21.600 align:start position:0%
bulletproof farmer excuse me no yeah I
 
05:56:23.628 --> 05:56:23.638 align:start position:0%
got that I was reading that thank you I
 
05:56:27.590 --> 05:56:27.600 align:start position:0%
meant specifically like um a caliber a
 
05:56:31.128 --> 05:56:31.138 align:start position:0%
brand not a caliber uh some of the other
 
05:56:34.128 --> 05:56:34.138 align:start position:0%
states that have statutes do go into
 
05:56:34.138 --> 05:56:35.510 align:start position:0%
states that have statutes do go into
that

05:56:35.510 --> 05:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:56:37.070 --> 05:56:37.080 align:start position:0%
and I'm trying to keep it very
 
05:56:39.530 --> 05:56:39.540 align:start position:0%
generalized some of them say uh how much
 
05:56:42.288 --> 05:56:42.298 align:start position:0%
tungsten carbide could be part of the
 
05:56:44.330 --> 05:56:44.340 align:start position:0%
core because that's an important part of
 
05:56:48.350 --> 05:56:48.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:51.410 --> 05:56:51.420 align:start position:0%
I don't have a direct answer for you but
 
05:56:53.150 --> 05:56:53.160 align:start position:0%
the generalized answer is anything
 
05:56:55.310 --> 05:56:55.320 align:start position:0%
designed or intended to pierce armor
 
05:56:58.128 --> 05:56:58.138 align:start position:0%
okay all right thank you
 
05:56:58.138 --> 05:57:05.410 align:start position:0%
okay all right thank you
foreign

05:57:05.410 --> 05:57:05.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:07.610 --> 05:57:07.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
05:57:09.650 --> 05:57:09.660 align:start position:0%
taking my question representative what
 
05:57:11.690 --> 05:57:11.700 align:start position:0%
would be the procedure if a person
 
05:57:18.110 --> 05:57:18.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:21.590 --> 05:57:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:21.600 --> 05:57:23.090 align:start position:0%
 
well

05:57:23.090 --> 05:57:23.100 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:57:26.990 --> 05:57:27.000 align:start position:0%
it says it takes effect January 1st 2024
 
05:57:29.150 --> 05:57:29.160 align:start position:0%
I think there would probably be a phase
 
05:57:31.190 --> 05:57:31.200 align:start position:0%
out like uh we do with dangerous
 
05:57:33.770 --> 05:57:33.780 align:start position:0%
chemicals we never uh I'm in the
 
05:57:35.810 --> 05:57:35.820 align:start position:0%
chemical sales industry so I know a lot
 
05:57:37.190 --> 05:57:37.200 align:start position:0%
about that
 
05:57:37.200 --> 05:57:37.970 align:start position:0%
about that
um

05:57:37.970 --> 05:57:37.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:57:40.310 --> 05:57:40.320 align:start position:0%
and when we
 
05:57:44.270 --> 05:57:44.280 align:start position:0%
when we find toxic chemicals we we
 
05:57:47.628 --> 05:57:47.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:49.128 --> 05:57:49.138 align:start position:0%
and I don't know if I'm answering your
 
05:57:51.948 --> 05:57:51.958 align:start position:0%
question uh that could be something the
 
05:57:54.530 --> 05:57:54.540 align:start position:0%
committee could add to it
 
05:57:56.810 --> 05:57:56.820 align:start position:0%
a phase-out portion
 
05:57:58.970 --> 05:57:58.980 align:start position:0%
because that's a good question that I
 
05:58:04.430 --> 05:58:04.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:06.410 --> 05:58:06.420 align:start position:0%
representative Manny
 
05:58:08.090 --> 05:58:08.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
05:58:09.890 --> 05:58:09.900 align:start position:0%
taking my question my question is about
 
05:58:11.868 --> 05:58:11.878 align:start position:0%
the amendment to it state county and
 
05:58:13.548 --> 05:58:13.558 align:start position:0%
municipal office will be exempt in the
 
05:58:15.288 --> 05:58:15.298 align:start position:0%
course of their official duties I know a
 
05:58:17.690 --> 05:58:17.700 align:start position:0%
lot of state troopers and Deputy
 
05:58:19.368 --> 05:58:19.378 align:start position:0%
sheriffs would take their cruises home
 
05:58:21.410 --> 05:58:21.420 align:start position:0%
they're trained with this ammunition
 
05:58:23.628 --> 05:58:23.638 align:start position:0%
they would not be able to defend
 
05:58:25.490 --> 05:58:25.500 align:start position:0%
themselves because they would not be
 
05:58:27.170 --> 05:58:27.180 align:start position:0%
able to take that ammunition home with
 
05:58:28.670 --> 05:58:28.680 align:start position:0%
them is that the way I understand that
 
05:58:28.680 --> 05:58:30.288 align:start position:0%
them is that the way I understand that
correctly

05:58:30.288 --> 05:58:30.298 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
05:58:33.048 --> 05:58:33.058 align:start position:0%
no they would have to keep it locked up
 
05:58:35.030 --> 05:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
and it would be available for use if
 
05:58:37.190 --> 05:58:37.200 align:start position:0%
they were using it for official use but
 
05:58:38.868 --> 05:58:38.878 align:start position:0%
if it's locked up at their house they
 
05:58:40.850 --> 05:58:40.860 align:start position:0%
could not possess it according to this
 
05:58:40.860 --> 05:58:43.910 align:start position:0%
could not possess it according to this
bill

05:58:43.910 --> 05:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:46.788 --> 05:58:46.798 align:start position:0%
that's a good question uh
 
05:58:49.310 --> 05:58:49.320 align:start position:0%
there there would have to be some kind
 
05:58:51.410 --> 05:58:51.420 align:start position:0%
of lock up
 
05:58:54.830 --> 05:58:54.840 align:start position:0%
position that would be determined by the
 
05:58:56.868 --> 05:58:56.878 align:start position:0%
by the state authorities
 
05:59:01.430 --> 05:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:03.530 --> 05:59:03.540 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony all right
 
05:59:14.570 --> 05:59:14.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:14.580 --> 05:59:15.770 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:59:15.770 --> 05:59:15.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:59:18.288 --> 05:59:18.298 align:start position:0%
just letting the public know we have a
 
05:59:21.110 --> 05:59:21.120 align:start position:0%
whole stack of of testimony here
 
05:59:23.750 --> 05:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
um I hope that while while you get ready
 
05:59:26.030 --> 05:59:26.040 align:start position:0%
to testify you take into account what we
 
05:59:27.590 --> 05:59:27.600 align:start position:0%
just heard and
 
05:59:33.170 --> 05:59:33.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:33.180 --> 05:59:35.390 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:59:35.390 --> 05:59:35.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:37.190 --> 05:59:37.200 align:start position:0%
the first person I'm going to recognize
 
05:59:37.200 --> 05:59:39.350 align:start position:0%
the first person I'm going to recognize
is

05:59:39.350 --> 05:59:39.360 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:59:54.368 --> 05:59:54.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:57.470 --> 05:59:57.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you to the
 
06:00:01.430 --> 06:00:01.440 align:start position:0%
committee for hearing my testimony today
 
06:00:04.070 --> 06:00:04.080 align:start position:0%
um I've received more than a few emails
 
06:00:06.048 --> 06:00:06.058 align:start position:0%
on this particular bill
 
06:00:08.390 --> 06:00:08.400 align:start position:0%
they're not generally happy emails
 
06:00:10.250 --> 06:00:10.260 align:start position:0%
they're not pleased with it
 
06:00:11.570 --> 06:00:11.580 align:start position:0%
I think I should start with my
 
06:00:13.490 --> 06:00:13.500 align:start position:0%
background a little bit I have a
 
06:00:15.770 --> 06:00:15.780 align:start position:0%
background in competitive shooting as a
 
06:00:17.510 --> 06:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
range safety officer
 
06:00:19.970 --> 06:00:19.980 align:start position:0%
I hand load ammunition and I've been
 
06:00:22.070 --> 06:00:22.080 align:start position:0%
through the ATF process for
 
06:00:25.190 --> 06:00:25.200 align:start position:0%
manufacturing Small Arms ammunition so I
 
06:00:26.510 --> 06:00:26.520 align:start position:0%
know a little bit about what's going on
 
06:00:26.520 --> 06:00:27.890 align:start position:0%
know a little bit about what's going on
here

06:00:27.890 --> 06:00:27.900 align:start position:0%
here
 
06:00:29.690 --> 06:00:29.700 align:start position:0%
let me tell you the way that this bill
 
06:00:31.070 --> 06:00:31.080 align:start position:0%
is written
 
06:00:32.868 --> 06:00:32.878 align:start position:0%
first of all part of it is duplicative
 
06:00:35.230 --> 06:00:35.240 align:start position:0%
of federal law federal law already bans
 
06:00:37.670 --> 06:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
armor-piercing ammunition there are
 
06:00:39.530 --> 06:00:39.540 align:start position:0%
specific processes you can go through to
 
06:00:41.810 --> 06:00:41.820 align:start position:0%
make an ammunition armor piercing such
 
06:00:43.610 --> 06:00:43.620 align:start position:0%
as Teflon coating it
 
06:00:47.270 --> 06:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
that's prohibited but the I would almost
 
06:00:49.190 --> 06:00:49.200 align:start position:0%
say nefarious thing about this bill is
 
06:00:50.390 --> 06:00:50.400 align:start position:0%
that it actually goes in a very
 
06:00:52.010 --> 06:00:52.020 align:start position:0%
different direction
 
06:00:54.350 --> 06:00:54.360 align:start position:0%
the very generalized language of this
 
06:00:57.590 --> 06:00:57.600 align:start position:0%
bill suggests that any round that can
 
06:01:01.368 --> 06:01:01.378 align:start position:0%
Pierce any body armor would be a felony
 
06:01:04.128 --> 06:01:04.138 align:start position:0%
so let me explain how this works
 
06:01:06.110 --> 06:01:06.120 align:start position:0%
most police officers were running around
 
06:01:08.810 --> 06:01:08.820 align:start position:0%
are wearing either level 2A or level 2
 
06:01:11.990 --> 06:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
body armor that soft body armor that can
 
06:01:15.048 --> 06:01:15.058 align:start position:0%
be penetrated by Handgun Ammunition in
 
06:01:18.650 --> 06:01:18.660 align:start position:0%
excess of nine millimeter and all rifle
 
06:01:18.660 --> 06:01:20.330 align:start position:0%
excess of nine millimeter and all rifle
ammunition

06:01:20.330 --> 06:01:20.340 align:start position:0%
ammunition
 
06:01:23.090 --> 06:01:23.100 align:start position:0%
sorry bear with me
 
06:01:25.730 --> 06:01:25.740 align:start position:0%
just just so you know before you get too
 
06:01:27.170 --> 06:01:27.180 align:start position:0%
far into it
 
06:01:31.610 --> 06:01:31.620 align:start position:0%
um the committee has um three four Law
 
06:01:34.430 --> 06:01:34.440 align:start position:0%
Enforcement Officers so yes so we we're
 
06:01:36.350 --> 06:01:36.360 align:start position:0%
kind of aware of a lot of stuff so sure
 
06:01:39.830 --> 06:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:42.110 --> 06:01:42.120 align:start position:0%
um just to finish that thought you can
 
06:01:45.830 --> 06:01:45.840 align:start position:0%
accelerate a 22 caliber bullet out of a
 
06:01:47.690 --> 06:01:47.700 align:start position:0%
regular hunting rifle with a 20 inch
 
06:01:50.090 --> 06:01:50.100 align:start position:0%
barrel achieving nearly 4 000 feet per
 
06:01:52.250 --> 06:01:52.260 align:start position:0%
second and that will defeat typically
 
06:01:55.610 --> 06:01:55.620 align:start position:0%
level three and four steel body armor
 
06:01:57.110 --> 06:01:57.120 align:start position:0%
so what we've established here is the
 
06:01:59.090 --> 06:01:59.100 align:start position:0%
way this bill is written would make it a
 
06:02:04.448 --> 06:02:04.458 align:start position:0%
felony to possess every rifle ammunition
 
06:02:09.350 --> 06:02:09.360 align:start position:0%
and mini handgun ammunitions
 
06:02:12.830 --> 06:02:12.840 align:start position:0%
so let's talk now a little bit about the
 
06:02:15.048 --> 06:02:15.058 align:start position:0%
uh the ethical side of this this
 
06:02:16.610 --> 06:02:16.620 align:start position:0%
committee has one of the most solemn
 
06:02:19.730 --> 06:02:19.740 align:start position:0%
duties in the entire legislature you all
 
06:02:22.310 --> 06:02:22.320 align:start position:0%
are responsible for deciding who gets
 
06:02:24.410 --> 06:02:24.420 align:start position:0%
locked in a cage
 
06:02:26.990 --> 06:02:27.000 align:start position:0%
that's a very serious thing we have a
 
06:02:28.910 --> 06:02:28.920 align:start position:0%
tradition in this country of making sure
 
06:02:31.310 --> 06:02:31.320 align:start position:0%
only dangerous people who are a threat
 
06:02:33.350 --> 06:02:33.360 align:start position:0%
who have committed harms against Society
 
06:02:37.970 --> 06:02:37.980 align:start position:0%
get locked up in a cage this bill
 
06:02:41.570 --> 06:02:41.580 align:start position:0%
would lock my constituents in a cage it
 
06:02:44.448 --> 06:02:44.458 align:start position:0%
would lock my neighbors in a cage and it
 
06:02:47.390 --> 06:02:47.400 align:start position:0%
would lock me in a cage
 
06:02:50.810 --> 06:02:50.820 align:start position:0%
that's a very very serious thing we're
 
06:02:56.930 --> 06:02:56.940 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:56.940 --> 06:02:59.150 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:02:59.150 --> 06:02:59.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:01.128 --> 06:03:01.138 align:start position:0%
sorry I lost my thought there
 
06:03:03.590 --> 06:03:03.600 align:start position:0%
this is again this is a very serious
 
06:03:05.510 --> 06:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
issue we have to treat it with a
 
06:03:07.490 --> 06:03:07.500 align:start position:0%
seriousness it deserves the last point
 
06:03:09.410 --> 06:03:09.420 align:start position:0%
I'm going to make is that this actually
 
06:03:11.930 --> 06:03:11.940 align:start position:0%
refers to the one and only piece of
 
06:03:15.470 --> 06:03:15.480 align:start position:0%
property that is mentioned by name in
 
06:03:18.708 --> 06:03:18.718 align:start position:0%
our constitutions armaments
 
06:03:21.288 --> 06:03:21.298 align:start position:0%
that is the only piece of property named
 
06:03:23.930 --> 06:03:23.940 align:start position:0%
by in individually in the whole
 
06:03:23.940 --> 06:03:25.250 align:start position:0%
by in individually in the whole
Constitution

06:03:25.250 --> 06:03:25.260 align:start position:0%
Constitution
 
06:03:28.368 --> 06:03:28.378 align:start position:0%
and we have all sworn a duty to uphold
 
06:03:30.948 --> 06:03:30.958 align:start position:0%
and defend that document
 
06:03:33.830 --> 06:03:33.840 align:start position:0%
and I hope that you will all join me in
 
06:03:37.730 --> 06:03:37.740 align:start position:0%
strictly being against this Bill thank
 
06:03:38.810 --> 06:03:38.820 align:start position:0%
you very much I'm happy to take
 
06:03:38.820 --> 06:03:42.350 align:start position:0%
you very much I'm happy to take
questions

06:03:42.350 --> 06:03:42.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:46.788 --> 06:03:46.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:48.770 --> 06:03:48.780 align:start position:0%
I just haven't I I don't have the
 
06:03:50.330 --> 06:03:50.340 align:start position:0%
Constitution memorized so I'm just
 
06:03:51.890 --> 06:03:51.900 align:start position:0%
wondering where I believe you said
 
06:03:54.708 --> 06:03:54.718 align:start position:0%
Armament is that what you said is well
 
06:03:56.030 --> 06:03:56.040 align:start position:0%
that would be the extended version of
 
06:04:00.650 --> 06:04:00.660 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:02.150 --> 06:04:02.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
06:04:15.350 --> 06:04:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:20.690 --> 06:04:20.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:23.690 --> 06:04:23.700 align:start position:0%
I'll never get it right so
 
06:04:25.970 --> 06:04:25.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair trust me I started
 
06:04:28.128 --> 06:04:28.138 align:start position:0%
standing up when I saw you wondering how
 
06:04:30.410 --> 06:04:30.420 align:start position:0%
to pronounce the last name I'm aware say
 
06:04:32.448 --> 06:04:32.458 align:start position:0%
it for me please how do you say it I
 
06:04:34.430 --> 06:04:34.440 align:start position:0%
said Popovich Miller but I promise not
 
06:04:35.990 --> 06:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
to come here so often that you need to
 
06:04:38.150 --> 06:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
really remember it
 
06:04:40.850 --> 06:04:40.860 align:start position:0%
um and honestly
 
06:04:43.128 --> 06:04:43.138 align:start position:0%
I was playing this was my day off I'm on
 
06:04:45.110 --> 06:04:45.120 align:start position:0%
the finance committee this is a rare day
 
06:04:46.850 --> 06:04:46.860 align:start position:0%
off for me the only reason I drove to
 
06:04:48.470 --> 06:04:48.480 align:start position:0%
Concord is to speak against this
 
06:04:50.690 --> 06:04:50.700 align:start position:0%
legislation I just could not in good
 
06:04:52.548 --> 06:04:52.558 align:start position:0%
conscious stay home and not talk to the
 
06:04:54.530 --> 06:04:54.540 align:start position:0%
committee about it
 
06:04:56.510 --> 06:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
it's only three lines of legislation and
 
06:04:58.310 --> 06:04:58.320 align:start position:0%
it has the highest density of legal
 
06:05:00.230 --> 06:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
concerns that I've ever seen in
 
06:05:03.110 --> 06:05:03.120 align:start position:0%
legislation first and I'll try not to
 
06:05:05.030 --> 06:05:05.040 align:start position:0%
belabor points that were already covered
 
06:05:09.830 --> 06:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
it is so vague I cannot comply with it I
 
06:05:11.990 --> 06:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
have no idea what's covered previous
 
06:05:13.610 --> 06:05:13.620 align:start position:0%
speaker already covered some of the
 
06:05:15.288 --> 06:05:15.298 align:start position:0%
details I'm not gonna repeat it but I
 
06:05:17.690 --> 06:05:17.700 align:start position:0%
will just say that any law that is so
 
06:05:20.750 --> 06:05:20.760 align:start position:0%
vague that a regular citizen does not
 
06:05:23.750 --> 06:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
know how to follow it should not be ever
 
06:05:23.760 --> 06:05:25.128 align:start position:0%
know how to follow it should not be ever
passed

06:05:25.128 --> 06:05:25.138 align:start position:0%
passed
 
06:05:27.410 --> 06:05:27.420 align:start position:0%
you know or else we will all be guilty
 
06:05:28.910 --> 06:05:28.920 align:start position:0%
and whoever goes to jail will be
 
06:05:31.010 --> 06:05:31.020 align:start position:0%
determined by the mood of you know
 
06:05:33.350 --> 06:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
whatever law enforcement is charging
 
06:05:36.048 --> 06:05:36.058 align:start position:0%
people is arresting people
 
06:05:38.150 --> 06:05:38.160 align:start position:0%
it was already covered that not only
 
06:05:40.250 --> 06:05:40.260 align:start position:0%
there is no definition of what the ammo
 
06:05:42.830 --> 06:05:42.840 align:start position:0%
is but there is no definition of armor
 
06:05:45.410 --> 06:05:45.420 align:start position:0%
in the law it just says armor what is
 
06:05:47.110 --> 06:05:47.120 align:start position:0%
armor I mean if you make that definition
 
06:05:51.350 --> 06:05:51.360 align:start position:0%
you know unclear any
 
06:05:54.110 --> 06:05:54.120 align:start position:0%
ammo of any kind could become subject to
 
06:05:55.430 --> 06:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
this ban
 
06:05:59.570 --> 06:05:59.580 align:start position:0%
which means this is a ban of firearms a
 
06:06:01.970 --> 06:06:01.980 align:start position:0%
firearm that does not have ammo that you
 
06:06:04.310 --> 06:06:04.320 align:start position:0%
can use is a club and a particularly
 
06:06:06.830 --> 06:06:06.840 align:start position:0%
useless Club because frankly the grips
 
06:06:09.708 --> 06:06:09.718 align:start position:0%
are terrible for using it that way so
 
06:06:12.288 --> 06:06:12.298 align:start position:0%
absolutely this is a ban out firearms
 
06:06:14.150 --> 06:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
and by the way I mean no way implying
 
06:06:15.948 --> 06:06:15.958 align:start position:0%
that was the intent of the legislation
 
06:06:17.930 --> 06:06:17.940 align:start position:0%
I'm just telling you what the outcome of
 
06:06:21.170 --> 06:06:21.180 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:24.948 --> 06:06:24.958 align:start position:0%
also because it bans ammo that is in use
 
06:06:27.470 --> 06:06:27.480 align:start position:0%
legal use common use for legal purposes
 
06:06:29.590 --> 06:06:29.600 align:start position:0%
by a large percentage of our population
 
06:06:32.750 --> 06:06:32.760 align:start position:0%
this is anti-constitutional in space you
 
06:06:34.610 --> 06:06:34.620 align:start position:0%
know that if we pass it it will end up
 
06:06:37.330 --> 06:06:37.340 align:start position:0%
challenged in courts and being struck as
 
06:06:39.350 --> 06:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
anti-constitutional no point in going
 
06:06:43.430 --> 06:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
through the exercise even if it passed
 
06:06:45.590 --> 06:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
the only outcome of adding this
 
06:06:48.230 --> 06:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
paragraph to our rsas would be to put
 
06:06:51.048 --> 06:06:51.058 align:start position:0%
innocent people into jail not one
 
06:06:52.910 --> 06:06:52.920 align:start position:0%
criminal will be convicted because of
 
06:06:55.070 --> 06:06:55.080 align:start position:0%
this law that's already covered in the
 
06:06:57.650 --> 06:06:57.660 align:start position:0%
two first two paragraphs that RSA
 
06:06:59.930 --> 06:06:59.940 align:start position:0%
section it covers the people to commit
 
06:07:02.990 --> 06:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
that commit crimes this legislation will
 
06:07:06.410 --> 06:07:06.420 align:start position:0%
only be used to convict innocence people
 
06:07:08.810 --> 06:07:08.820 align:start position:0%
who cross the law that they didn't
 
06:07:10.610 --> 06:07:10.620 align:start position:0%
realize they were violating or they
 
06:07:12.530 --> 06:07:12.540 align:start position:0%
didn't think was worth following and by
 
06:07:16.070 --> 06:07:16.080 align:start position:0%
the way civil disobedience is a thing
 
06:07:18.770 --> 06:07:18.780 align:start position:0%
but they never committed any crime they
 
06:07:20.868 --> 06:07:20.878 align:start position:0%
were planning to shoot targets to to do
 
06:07:22.610 --> 06:07:22.620 align:start position:0%
other things with the darn ammo we
 
06:07:24.770 --> 06:07:24.780 align:start position:0%
shouldn't put those people in jail any
 
06:07:26.990 --> 06:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
law that doesn't require anybody to be
 
06:07:30.110 --> 06:07:30.120 align:start position:0%
harmed for people to go to jail is a
 
06:07:32.868 --> 06:07:32.878 align:start position:0%
very tough law to defend I mean I looked
 
06:07:35.030 --> 06:07:35.040 align:start position:0%
up at the New England Northern New
 
06:07:37.190 --> 06:07:37.200 align:start position:0%
England Poison Control Center and they
 
06:07:39.830 --> 06:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
list 29 poisonous plants that grow
 
06:07:41.868 --> 06:07:41.878 align:start position:0%
commonly all around the New Hampshire
 
06:07:45.590 --> 06:07:45.600 align:start position:0%
and 13 indoor plants that are poisonous
 
06:07:48.470 --> 06:07:48.480 align:start position:0%
should those people who may be unaware
 
06:07:50.330 --> 06:07:50.340 align:start position:0%
the darn things are poisonous or never
 
06:07:52.910 --> 06:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
intend to use them to poison people be
 
06:07:55.730 --> 06:07:55.740 align:start position:0%
sent to jail for possessing poison I
 
06:07:57.708 --> 06:07:57.718 align:start position:0%
mean they possess poison
 
06:08:00.948 --> 06:08:00.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:02.930 --> 06:08:02.940 align:start position:0%
I'll conclude by saying that I'm a
 
06:08:05.448 --> 06:08:05.458 align:start position:0%
freshman legislature I do my best to
 
06:08:07.430 --> 06:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
work across the aisle
 
06:08:10.788 --> 06:08:10.798 align:start position:0%
my two bills are bipartisan every bee
 
06:08:12.350 --> 06:08:12.360 align:start position:0%
life co-sponsored the bills that I
 
06:08:14.510 --> 06:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
co-sponsored range from all the other
 
06:08:16.548 --> 06:08:16.558 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors being Republican to all the
 
06:08:17.930 --> 06:08:17.940 align:start position:0%

Democrat
 
06:08:23.030 --> 06:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
I genuinely just try to do the right
 
06:08:25.368 --> 06:08:25.378 align:start position:0%
thing every time with disregard for
 
06:08:27.650 --> 06:08:27.660 align:start position:0%
ideology and what party we are from and
 
06:08:29.868 --> 06:08:29.878 align:start position:0%
I urge the committee to do the right
 
06:08:32.448 --> 06:08:32.458 align:start position:0%
thing and you know send this bill to the
 
06:08:35.628 --> 06:08:35.638 align:start position:0%
house with a near unanimous uh itl
 
06:08:38.208 --> 06:08:38.218 align:start position:0%
recommendation please because
 
06:08:40.190 --> 06:08:40.200 align:start position:0%
this is not something we should be doing
 
06:08:42.288 --> 06:08:42.298 align:start position:0%
we have way better things to spend our
 
06:08:44.930 --> 06:08:44.940 align:start position:0%
time and I really appreciate your time
 
06:08:47.930 --> 06:08:47.940 align:start position:0%
so I'll finish here thank you
 
06:08:50.750 --> 06:08:50.760 align:start position:0%
thank you

I speak definitely in opposition to this
bill

bill
 
06:09:29.930 --> 06:09:29.940 align:start position:0%
um this bill just owning and storing
 
06:09:32.690 --> 06:09:32.700 align:start position:0%
this kind of I'm ammunition like has
 
06:09:34.788 --> 06:09:34.798 align:start position:0%
already been said you would already be
 
06:09:37.548 --> 06:09:37.558 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering which was not answered
 
06:09:38.890 --> 06:09:38.900 align:start position:0%
by the
 
06:09:42.830 --> 06:09:42.840 align:start position:0%
sponsor was how it seems like you could
 
06:09:44.810 --> 06:09:44.820 align:start position:0%
you could literally
 
06:09:48.230 --> 06:09:48.240 align:start position:0%
um with a warrant mind you uh go to
 
06:09:49.970 --> 06:09:49.980 align:start position:0%
everybody's home you know look at a list
 
06:09:53.390 --> 06:09:53.400 align:start position:0%
of anybody who bought a rifle and they
 
06:09:55.128 --> 06:09:55.138 align:start position:0%
probably have this kind of ammunition
 
06:09:55.138 --> 06:09:56.590 align:start position:0%
probably have this kind of ammunition
literally

06:09:56.590 --> 06:09:56.600 align:start position:0%
literally
 
06:10:01.070 --> 06:10:01.080 align:start position:0%
start arresting people so this is this
 
06:10:04.670 --> 06:10:04.680 align:start position:0%
is just a disaster uh for uh Second
 
06:10:08.390 --> 06:10:08.400 align:start position:0%
Amendment and a private uh you know plus
 
06:10:10.970 --> 06:10:10.980 align:start position:0%
also what's interesting too uh just
 
06:10:13.310 --> 06:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
adding that part about a police being
 
06:10:17.090 --> 06:10:17.100 align:start position:0%
exempt but as I see it when it comes to
 
06:10:19.070 --> 06:10:19.080 align:start position:0%
the Second Amendment the population
 
06:10:21.770 --> 06:10:21.780 align:start position:0%
should be have the same capability
 
06:10:25.788 --> 06:10:25.798 align:start position:0%
abilities to protect themselves as as
 
06:10:28.690 --> 06:10:28.700 align:start position:0%
the government and so law enforcement
 
06:10:31.610 --> 06:10:31.620 align:start position:0%
can have this kind of ammunition but not
 
06:10:33.830 --> 06:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
the general public that's a disaster I
 
06:10:35.930 --> 06:10:35.940 align:start position:0%
want the general public individual
 
06:10:37.548 --> 06:10:37.558 align:start position:0%
citizens to have at least the same
 
06:10:42.288 --> 06:10:42.298 align:start position:0%
amount of uh protection against tyranny
 
06:10:44.030 --> 06:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
um and uh
 
06:10:46.010 --> 06:10:46.020 align:start position:0%
well that's about it
 
06:10:49.910 --> 06:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
um thank you uh any any questions
 
06:10:54.410 --> 06:10:54.420 align:start position:0%

06:11:07.430 --> 06:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
thanks for your time I'm sorry that
 
06:11:10.128 --> 06:11:10.138 align:start position:0%
we're all doing this today
 
06:11:11.868 --> 06:11:11.878 align:start position:0%
um I think it's been made clear that the
 
06:11:13.910 --> 06:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
bill is is poorly written
 
06:11:17.090 --> 06:11:17.100 align:start position:0%
it if you read it it speaks to to armor
 
06:11:19.190 --> 06:11:19.200 align:start position:0%
plating well
 
06:11:20.690 --> 06:11:20.700 align:start position:0%
we've had definitions for different
 
06:11:23.770 --> 06:11:23.780 align:start position:0%
levels of armor for for decades nij list
 
06:11:28.190 --> 06:11:28.200 align:start position:0%
two was it 2A or two plus three three a
 
06:11:31.250 --> 06:11:31.260 align:start position:0%
level four rifle plates and it fails to
 
06:11:33.470 --> 06:11:33.480 align:start position:0%
Define it so so does this apply what
 
06:11:35.510 --> 06:11:35.520 align:start position:0%
what is an armor plating is that like a
 
06:11:39.530 --> 06:11:39.540 align:start position:0%
medieval you know breastplate I mean
 
06:11:41.208 --> 06:11:41.218 align:start position:0%
the effect
 
06:11:46.670 --> 06:11:46.680 align:start position:0%
of this bill will Define any and all
 
06:11:50.510 --> 06:11:50.520 align:start position:0%
ammunition as armor piercing
 
06:11:53.570 --> 06:11:53.580 align:start position:0%
all hunting ammunition will be armor
 
06:11:53.580 --> 06:11:54.890 align:start position:0%
all hunting ammunition will be armor
piercing

06:11:54.890 --> 06:11:54.900 align:start position:0%
piercing
 
06:11:57.770 --> 06:11:57.780 align:start position:0%
all self-defense ammo will be armor
 
06:12:01.310 --> 06:12:01.320 align:start position:0%
piercing it it's an ill couldn't see of
 
06:12:03.770 --> 06:12:03.780 align:start position:0%
Bill I haven't seen anything this bad
 
06:12:06.890 --> 06:12:06.900 align:start position:0%
since Jeannie deach's range closer act
 
06:12:10.730 --> 06:12:10.740 align:start position:0%
in 2020. the unintended or intended
 
06:12:14.270 --> 06:12:14.280 align:start position:0%
consequences of this are horrific
 
06:12:14.280 --> 06:12:15.590 align:start position:0%
consequences of this are horrific
uh

06:12:15.590 --> 06:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:12:18.730 --> 06:12:18.740 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry to be so harsh about this but
 
06:12:23.150 --> 06:12:23.160 align:start position:0%
I expect better from from proposed bills
 
06:12:25.430 --> 06:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
than this they should be better
 
06:12:27.530 --> 06:12:27.540 align:start position:0%
considered and better thought out than
 
06:12:27.540 --> 06:12:28.310 align:start position:0%
considered and better thought out than
this

06:12:28.310 --> 06:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:12:31.368 --> 06:12:31.378 align:start position:0%
and so I'm sorry to be harsh but we're
 
06:12:34.250 --> 06:12:34.260 align:start position:0%
talking about a constitutional right
 
06:12:37.010 --> 06:12:37.020 align:start position:0%
and and I anticipate or I hope that
 
06:12:39.590 --> 06:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
everybody on this committee will take
 
06:12:42.048 --> 06:12:42.058 align:start position:0%
that under consideration and uphold
 
06:12:44.868 --> 06:12:44.878 align:start position:0%
their duty to defend and protect our
 
06:12:47.270 --> 06:12:47.280 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights
 
06:12:47.280 --> 06:12:48.470 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights
um

06:12:48.470 --> 06:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:12:50.750 --> 06:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I'll entertain any
 
06:12:52.670 --> 06:12:52.680 align:start position:0%
questions you may have
 
06:12:55.128 --> 06:12:55.138 align:start position:0%
otherwise thank you for your time
 
06:12:59.770 --> 06:12:59.780 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:11.150 --> 06:13:11.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:13.730 --> 06:13:13.740 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
06:13:16.670 --> 06:13:16.680 align:start position:0%
I'm a little nervous so forgive me
 
06:13:19.548 --> 06:13:19.558 align:start position:0%
um I applaud this bill I'm opposed to it
 
06:13:22.628 --> 06:13:22.638 align:start position:0%
but I applaud it has good intentions
 
06:13:24.770 --> 06:13:24.780 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it sounds like the
 
06:13:27.288 --> 06:13:27.298 align:start position:0%
gentleman who put it Forward doesn't
 
06:13:30.350 --> 06:13:30.360 align:start position:0%
have a whole lot of understanding of
 
06:13:35.270 --> 06:13:35.280 align:start position:0%
ballistics and uh firearms in general
 
06:13:37.670 --> 06:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
so everything I want to say has already
 
06:13:41.150 --> 06:13:41.160 align:start position:0%
been said except that I want to add that
 
06:13:44.448 --> 06:13:44.458 align:start position:0%
there's already a provision for Criminal
 
06:13:46.910 --> 06:13:46.920 align:start position:0%
Intent in the bill that it would be
 
06:13:48.410 --> 06:13:48.420 align:start position:0%
added to
 
06:13:52.368 --> 06:13:52.378 align:start position:0%
there's no Criminal Intent at all people
 
06:13:54.590 --> 06:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
could be found guilty with no Criminal
 
06:13:54.600 --> 06:13:55.788 align:start position:0%
could be found guilty with no Criminal
Intent

06:13:55.788 --> 06:13:55.798 align:start position:0%
Intent
 
06:13:58.368 --> 06:13:58.378 align:start position:0%
I could just see a zealous an
 
06:14:00.788 --> 06:14:00.798 align:start position:0%
overzealous prosecutor
 
06:14:03.830 --> 06:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
crucifying someone over this bill
 
06:14:05.510 --> 06:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
I I
 
06:14:08.090 --> 06:14:08.100 align:start position:0%
don't know what else to say it's it's I
 
06:14:10.670 --> 06:14:10.680 align:start position:0%
applaud the bill but it's just not well
 
06:14:12.948 --> 06:14:12.958 align:start position:0%
thought out by someone who's not
 
06:14:17.390 --> 06:14:17.400 align:start position:0%
familiar with firearms and I believe I
 
06:14:19.310 --> 06:14:19.320 align:start position:0%
don't believe that anybody wants to put
 
06:14:22.010 --> 06:14:22.020 align:start position:0%
innocent people in in prison I heard the
 
06:14:24.770 --> 06:14:24.780 align:start position:0%
testimony of the parole stuff and that
 
06:14:27.288 --> 06:14:27.298 align:start position:0%
broke my heart to hear some of the what
 
06:14:29.868 --> 06:14:29.878 align:start position:0%
people go through that we never think of
 
06:14:29.878 --> 06:14:31.010 align:start position:0%
people go through that we never think of
so

06:14:31.010 --> 06:14:31.020 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:14:33.288 --> 06:14:33.298 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for allowing me to
 
06:14:36.110 --> 06:14:36.120 align:start position:0%
speak thank you for coming in today
 
06:14:39.470 --> 06:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
chair calls Andrew schneller
 
06:14:41.810 --> 06:14:41.820 align:start position:0%
Schuler anything that sounds remotely
 
06:14:46.070 --> 06:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:48.170 --> 06:14:48.180 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time
 
06:14:51.948 --> 06:14:51.958 align:start position:0%
um I am against the bill I am a recent
 
06:14:53.510 --> 06:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
Grant seder I've been here almost two
 
06:14:56.208 --> 06:14:56.218 align:start position:0%
years now and I came here for more
 
06:14:56.218 --> 06:14:57.250 align:start position:0%
years now and I came here for more
freedom

06:14:57.250 --> 06:14:57.260 align:start position:0%
freedom
 
06:15:00.770 --> 06:15:00.780 align:start position:0%
monetarily economics uh and Firearms as
 
06:15:00.780 --> 06:15:02.090 align:start position:0%
monetarily economics uh and Firearms as
well

06:15:02.090 --> 06:15:02.100 align:start position:0%
well
 
06:15:03.048 --> 06:15:03.058 align:start position:0%
um but there's been a lot of great
 
06:15:05.570 --> 06:15:05.580 align:start position:0%
testimony so far but I but for my
 
06:15:07.430 --> 06:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
experience as an engineer I just like to
 
06:15:10.250 --> 06:15:10.260 align:start position:0%
add that you can also get non-firearms
 
06:15:12.110 --> 06:15:12.120 align:start position:0%
that can Pierce armor like bow and
 
06:15:15.230 --> 06:15:15.240 align:start position:0%
arrows the boat and you can Pierce armor
 
06:15:16.730 --> 06:15:16.740 align:start position:0%
even without combustion without
 
06:15:19.250 --> 06:15:19.260 align:start position:0%
explosion and so the idea of this bill
 
06:15:22.250 --> 06:15:22.260 align:start position:0%
is just to ban all firearm ammunition in
 
06:15:23.750 --> 06:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire and I think
 
06:15:25.910 --> 06:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
that would weaken New Hampshire from any
 
06:15:27.350 --> 06:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
other potential
 
06:15:30.410 --> 06:15:30.420 align:start position:0%
incursions from criminals that's all I
 
06:15:32.390 --> 06:15:32.400 align:start position:0%
wanted to say thank you guys
 
06:15:35.628 --> 06:15:35.638 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
06:15:38.030 --> 06:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
and and to committee members if you have
 
06:15:39.890 --> 06:15:39.900 align:start position:0%
a question of a
 
06:15:42.048 --> 06:15:42.058 align:start position:0%
um please act fast because I'm going to
 
06:15:45.948 --> 06:15:45.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:48.470 --> 06:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
um chair recognizes Paul
 
06:15:48.480 --> 06:15:52.010 align:start position:0%
um chair recognizes Paul
O'Connell

06:15:52.010 --> 06:15:52.020 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:57.048 --> 06:15:57.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:57.058 --> 06:16:00.250 align:start position:0%
 
so

06:16:00.250 --> 06:16:00.260 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:02.448 --> 06:16:02.458 align:start position:0%
nice to see people coming here for
 
06:16:02.458 --> 06:16:03.650 align:start position:0%
nice to see people coming here for
freedom

06:16:03.650 --> 06:16:03.660 align:start position:0%
freedom
 
06:16:06.470 --> 06:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
so everything that I am excuse me
 
06:16:08.090 --> 06:16:08.100 align:start position:0%
everything that I want to say basically
 
06:16:10.490 --> 06:16:10.500 align:start position:0%
is um Ben said
 
06:16:13.010 --> 06:16:13.020 align:start position:0%
um I came here today because it's such a
 
06:16:16.850 --> 06:16:16.860 align:start position:0%
vague Bill everybody brought it up and
 
06:16:19.070 --> 06:16:19.080 align:start position:0%
um I think that
 
06:16:21.530 --> 06:16:21.540 align:start position:0%
as a sportsman someone who's interested
 
06:16:24.288 --> 06:16:24.298 align:start position:0%
in shooting sports hunting all of that I
 
06:16:26.390 --> 06:16:26.400 align:start position:0%
belong to a number of different clubs I
 
06:16:29.150 --> 06:16:29.160 align:start position:0%
do three gun we travel around
 
06:16:32.510 --> 06:16:32.520 align:start position:0%
if this bill was signed excuse me I
 
06:16:34.610 --> 06:16:34.620 align:start position:0%
don't know why I'm like so nervous but
 
06:16:36.470 --> 06:16:36.480 align:start position:0%
if this bill was signed
 
06:16:40.310 --> 06:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
this is what 34 clubs in New Hampshire
 
06:16:44.390 --> 06:16:44.400 align:start position:0%
say 2 000 members per Club so
 
06:16:46.670 --> 06:16:46.680 align:start position:0%
it would probably make somewhere around
 
06:16:48.288 --> 06:16:48.298 align:start position:0%
60 to 70
 
06:16:48.298 --> 06:16:49.430 align:start position:0%
60 to 70
000

06:16:49.430 --> 06:16:49.440 align:start position:0%
000
 
06:16:51.230 --> 06:16:51.240 align:start position:0%
um people in New Hampshire
 
06:16:51.240 --> 06:16:52.490 align:start position:0%
um people in New Hampshire
felons

06:16:52.490 --> 06:16:52.500 align:start position:0%
felons
 
06:16:55.548 --> 06:16:55.558 align:start position:0%
with the stroke of a pen because
 
06:16:58.850 --> 06:16:58.860 align:start position:0%
we all have excuse me
 
06:17:02.208 --> 06:17:02.218 align:start position:0%
we all have um you know it's so vague
 
06:17:04.070 --> 06:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
all my hunting rounds would be
 
06:17:07.368 --> 06:17:07.378 align:start position:0%
incorporated into this and at 70 years
 
06:17:10.368 --> 06:17:10.378 align:start position:0%
old I'd be a felon so
 
06:17:14.690 --> 06:17:14.700 align:start position:0%
um thank the committee for listening
 
06:17:16.970 --> 06:17:16.980 align:start position:0%
um if you can't tell I'm nervous
 
06:17:20.150 --> 06:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
and um please
 
06:17:21.948 --> 06:17:21.958 align:start position:0%
don't pass this bill
 
06:17:25.610 --> 06:17:25.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:33.410 --> 06:17:33.420 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:34.970 --> 06:17:34.980 align:start position:0%

my name is Kevin Williams and I am
 
06:17:40.730 --> 06:17:40.740 align:start position:0%
against the bill and I'll give you a
 
06:17:42.650 --> 06:17:42.660 align:start position:0%
little bit of my background I just
 
06:17:44.990 --> 06:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
recently retired from 26 years of law
 
06:17:45.000 --> 06:17:46.910 align:start position:0%
recently retired from 26 years of law
enforcement

06:17:46.910 --> 06:17:46.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
06:17:49.850 --> 06:17:49.860 align:start position:0%
um part of my job is in law enforcement
 
06:17:52.190 --> 06:17:52.200 align:start position:0%
I spent 15 years as a senior Firearms
 
06:17:54.650 --> 06:17:54.660 align:start position:0%
instructor for a federal agency
 
06:17:57.288 --> 06:17:57.298 align:start position:0%
I'm a use of force instructor a active
 
06:17:59.208 --> 06:17:59.218 align:start position:0%
shooter response instructor Close
 
06:18:01.368 --> 06:18:01.378 align:start position:0%
Quarters battle instructor and I'm also
 
06:18:03.288 --> 06:18:03.298 align:start position:0%
an EMT who has actively worked on the
 
06:18:05.868 --> 06:18:05.878 align:start position:0%
ambulances here in New Hampshire
 
06:18:05.878 --> 06:18:07.788 align:start position:0%
ambulances here in New Hampshire
um

06:18:07.788 --> 06:18:07.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:18:10.970 --> 06:18:10.980 align:start position:0%
the bill extremely vague it would pretty
 
06:18:10.980 --> 06:18:12.048 align:start position:0%
the bill extremely vague it would pretty
much

06:18:12.048 --> 06:18:12.058 align:start position:0%
much
 
06:18:14.030 --> 06:18:14.040 align:start position:0%
make almost all ammunition out there
 
06:18:16.670 --> 06:18:16.680 align:start position:0%
illegal in the state of New Hampshire as
 
06:18:18.830 --> 06:18:18.840 align:start position:0%
an officer wearing soft body armor
 
06:18:20.750 --> 06:18:20.760 align:start position:0%
every rifle round would penetrate my
 
06:18:22.548 --> 06:18:22.558 align:start position:0%
vest and that's something I had to deal
 
06:18:25.190 --> 06:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
with every day but it's the nature of
 
06:18:28.250 --> 06:18:28.260 align:start position:0%
the Beast you didn't need special
 
06:18:30.288 --> 06:18:30.298 align:start position:0%
armor-piercing ammo to penetrate my body
 
06:18:30.298 --> 06:18:31.970 align:start position:0%
armor-piercing ammo to penetrate my body
armor

06:18:31.970 --> 06:18:31.980 align:start position:0%
armor
 
06:18:31.980 --> 06:18:32.930 align:start position:0%
armor
um

06:18:32.930 --> 06:18:32.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:18:34.250 --> 06:18:34.260 align:start position:0%
regular hunting rods would have
 
06:18:35.448 --> 06:18:35.458 align:start position:0%
penetrated it
 
06:18:39.410 --> 06:18:39.420 align:start position:0%
so having 26 years in law enforcement I
 
06:18:41.690 --> 06:18:41.700 align:start position:0%
think this is a bill that is
 
06:18:45.948 --> 06:18:45.958 align:start position:0%
a solution looking for a problem I don't
 
06:18:47.330 --> 06:18:47.340 align:start position:0%
see it as a problem here in New
 
06:18:47.340 --> 06:18:48.310 align:start position:0%
see it as a problem here in New
Hampshire

06:18:48.310 --> 06:18:48.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
06:18:51.350 --> 06:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
it's already illegal to use ammunition
 
06:18:53.448 --> 06:18:53.458 align:start position:0%
to shoot somebody
 
06:18:55.548 --> 06:18:55.558 align:start position:0%
so whether it's armor piercing or not
 
06:18:57.708 --> 06:18:57.718 align:start position:0%
it's illegal to do that it's a crime
 
06:19:00.590 --> 06:19:00.600 align:start position:0%
it's a felony already so why are we
 
06:19:02.750 --> 06:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
trying to make more laws that are
 
06:19:05.208 --> 06:19:05.218 align:start position:0%
already illegal I mean it's
 
06:19:05.218 --> 06:19:05.990 align:start position:0%
already illegal I mean it's
um

06:19:05.990 --> 06:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:19:08.930 --> 06:19:08.940 align:start position:0%
you know and I I and I'm speaking as a
 
06:19:10.670 --> 06:19:10.680 align:start position:0%
law enforcement a former law enforcement
 
06:19:11.810 --> 06:19:11.820 align:start position:0%
officer who had a friend that was shot
 
06:19:13.670 --> 06:19:13.680 align:start position:0%
and killed in the line of duty
 
06:19:15.650 --> 06:19:15.660 align:start position:0%
that bill would not have saved him or
 
06:19:17.570 --> 06:19:17.580 align:start position:0%
protected him at all
 
06:19:21.350 --> 06:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
so uh I just don't think it's needed
 
06:19:23.810 --> 06:19:23.820 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time if I I could
 
06:19:25.670 --> 06:19:25.680 align:start position:0%
have just I'd like to use your expertise
 
06:19:27.948 --> 06:19:27.958 align:start position:0%
just real quick I have a question based
 
06:19:31.850 --> 06:19:31.860 align:start position:0%
on your your previous job as um
 
06:19:33.350 --> 06:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
um the Firearms instructor and use of
 
06:19:35.510 --> 06:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
force I did some research I couldn't
 
06:19:37.250 --> 06:19:37.260 align:start position:0%
find any are you aware of a police
 
06:19:39.110 --> 06:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
officer that's ever been killed with
 
06:19:42.770 --> 06:19:42.780 align:start position:0%
armor-piercing ammunition no anywhere
 
06:19:45.170 --> 06:19:45.180 align:start position:0%
no no I'm aware of finding okay thank
 
06:19:47.510 --> 06:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
you and the ammo that we carried was a
 
06:19:51.470 --> 06:19:51.480 align:start position:0%
62 grain soft point hunting round right
 
06:19:54.230 --> 06:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
06:19:56.150 --> 06:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
sure absolutely one more question sir if
 
06:19:57.590 --> 06:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
you don't mind
 
06:19:59.270 --> 06:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
sorry I also just wanted to take
 
06:20:01.070 --> 06:20:01.080 align:start position:0%
advantage of your expertise thank you Mr
 
06:20:02.628 --> 06:20:02.638 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
06:20:04.070 --> 06:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
question I was just wondering you know a
 
06:20:05.208 --> 06:20:05.218 align:start position:0%
lot of people have brought up how vague
 
06:20:07.310 --> 06:20:07.320 align:start position:0%
the definition is and this definition
 
06:20:09.170 --> 06:20:09.180 align:start position:0%
the sponsor said was pulled from the
 
06:20:11.570 --> 06:20:11.580 align:start position:0%
existing RSA do you think it would be
 
06:20:13.910 --> 06:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
amenable to change the definition and
 
06:20:17.810 --> 06:20:17.820 align:start position:0%
the RSA as it stands now
 
06:20:17.820 --> 06:20:20.868 align:start position:0%
the RSA as it stands now
well

06:20:20.868 --> 06:20:20.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:23.570 --> 06:20:23.580 align:start position:0%
the the term that really concerns me is
 
06:20:23.580 --> 06:20:26.090 align:start position:0%
the the term that really concerns me is
designed

06:20:26.090 --> 06:20:26.100 align:start position:0%
designed
 
06:20:27.890 --> 06:20:27.900 align:start position:0%
um who's to say what a round was
 
06:20:30.170 --> 06:20:30.180 align:start position:0%
designed for
 
06:20:34.070 --> 06:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
so you could take a 62 or 64 Grand 223
 
06:20:35.868 --> 06:20:35.878 align:start position:0%
soft point round which people use for
 
06:20:38.270 --> 06:20:38.280 align:start position:0%
hunting and it will penetrate a car door
 
06:20:40.548 --> 06:20:40.558 align:start position:0%
and it would penetrate my soft body
 
06:20:44.208 --> 06:20:44.218 align:start position:0%
armor but was it designed for that
 
06:20:47.330 --> 06:20:47.340 align:start position:0%
you take 30 odd 6 ammunition designed by
 
06:20:49.910 --> 06:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
the military uh back during World War
 
06:20:51.470 --> 06:20:51.480 align:start position:0%
One and World War II uh well
 
06:20:53.810 --> 06:20:53.820 align:start position:0%
predominantly World War one it was used
 
06:20:56.510 --> 06:20:56.520 align:start position:0%
definitely would penetrate body armor uh
 
06:20:58.250 --> 06:20:58.260 align:start position:0%
was it designed for body armor no they
 
06:21:00.530 --> 06:21:00.540 align:start position:0%
didn't have body armor back then
 
06:21:05.090 --> 06:21:05.100 align:start position:0%
um 308s used in World War II our guys
 
06:21:06.530 --> 06:21:06.540 align:start position:0%
weren't running around with body armor
 
06:21:08.930 --> 06:21:08.940 align:start position:0%
in World War II but yet a 308 will
 
06:21:11.990 --> 06:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
penetrate body armor so who's to say
 
06:21:13.610 --> 06:21:13.620 align:start position:0%
what Iran was designed for who's going
 
06:21:15.770 --> 06:21:15.780 align:start position:0%
to determine what that round was
 
06:21:18.288 --> 06:21:18.298 align:start position:0%
designed for and then intended who's
 
06:21:20.208 --> 06:21:20.218 align:start position:0%
going to determine what my intended use
 
06:21:21.948 --> 06:21:21.958 align:start position:0%
of that round was
 
06:21:24.530 --> 06:21:24.540 align:start position:0%
and again it's already a felony for me
 
06:21:28.128 --> 06:21:28.138 align:start position:0%
to use a projectile to shoot at somebody
 
06:21:30.530 --> 06:21:30.540 align:start position:0%
so I just
 
06:21:33.110 --> 06:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
I don't think there's uh any law needed
 
06:21:33.120 --> 06:21:33.970 align:start position:0%
I don't think there's uh any law needed
to

06:21:33.970 --> 06:21:33.980 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:21:36.470 --> 06:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
say that armor-piercing bullets are
 
06:21:38.510 --> 06:21:38.520 align:start position:0%
illegal or should be illegal because
 
06:21:42.948 --> 06:21:42.958 align:start position:0%
shooting at somebody is illegal period
 
06:21:47.090 --> 06:21:47.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:58.070 --> 06:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:59.750 --> 06:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
thank you members of the committee uh
 
06:22:01.128 --> 06:22:01.138 align:start position:0%
and thank you for listening to us all
 
06:22:03.470 --> 06:22:03.480 align:start position:0%
today I know it's a very trying long day
 
06:22:05.628 --> 06:22:05.638 align:start position:0%
for everyone so I appreciate it my name
 
06:22:06.948 --> 06:22:06.958 align:start position:0%
is Joe Hannon I'm the vice president for
 
06:22:08.570 --> 06:22:08.580 align:start position:0%
gun owners of New Hampshire
 
06:22:11.090 --> 06:22:11.100 align:start position:0%
uh obviously we're in in opposition to
 
06:22:13.850 --> 06:22:13.860 align:start position:0%
this bill uh I wasn't even sure what to
 
06:22:15.010 --> 06:22:15.020 align:start position:0%
say at first when I read it because
 
06:22:17.390 --> 06:22:17.400 align:start position:0%
where do I begin I mean there are so
 
06:22:19.910 --> 06:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
many uh I I could just say it's a bad
 
06:22:22.128 --> 06:22:22.138 align:start position:0%
Bill and just leave and probably just as
 
06:22:22.138 --> 06:22:23.510 align:start position:0%
Bill and just leave and probably just as
effective

06:22:23.510 --> 06:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
effective
 
06:22:25.490 --> 06:22:25.500 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm gonna just mention a couple
 
06:22:27.470 --> 06:22:27.480 align:start position:0%
things and not at the 50 or 60 things
 
06:22:29.090 --> 06:22:29.100 align:start position:0%
that I found
 
06:22:29.100 --> 06:22:29.868 align:start position:0%
that I found
um

06:22:29.868 --> 06:22:29.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:22:31.730 --> 06:22:31.740 align:start position:0%
we keep hearing that the definition is
 
06:22:33.948 --> 06:22:33.958 align:start position:0%
the same as the existing uh statute and
 
06:22:35.448 --> 06:22:35.458 align:start position:0%
it's not exactly the same
 
06:22:37.850 --> 06:22:37.860 align:start position:0%
uh the existing statute talks about
 
06:22:39.470 --> 06:22:39.480 align:start position:0%
armor piercing exploding bullets and
 
06:22:41.090 --> 06:22:41.100 align:start position:0%
cartridges the word ammunition has never
 
06:22:42.650 --> 06:22:42.660 align:start position:0%
even mentioned and if you look at the
 
06:22:44.090 --> 06:22:44.100 align:start position:0%
definition of ammunition most people
 
06:22:46.610 --> 06:22:46.620 align:start position:0%
think of ammunition as a full round or
 
06:22:48.350 --> 06:22:48.360 align:start position:0%
bullet cartridge well bullet is the tip
 
06:22:50.150 --> 06:22:50.160 align:start position:0%
of the part that comes out the the part
 
06:22:52.368 --> 06:22:52.378 align:start position:0%
that thing goes out after goes bang but
 
06:22:54.830 --> 06:22:54.840 align:start position:0%
uh ammunition could also refer to the
 
06:22:58.430 --> 06:22:58.440 align:start position:0%
case the primer the the accelerant any
 
06:23:02.090 --> 06:23:02.100 align:start position:0%
part of that whole round or cartridge is
 
06:23:05.090 --> 06:23:05.100 align:start position:0%
ammunition so manufacturing a custom
 
06:23:07.090 --> 06:23:07.100 align:start position:0%
production of any firearm ammunition
 
06:23:09.350 --> 06:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
that could be anything and it could be
 
06:23:10.730 --> 06:23:10.740 align:start position:0%
just parts of the bullet so if someone
 
06:23:12.350 --> 06:23:12.360 align:start position:0%
is making primers which is a little part
 
06:23:14.570 --> 06:23:14.580 align:start position:0%
that the pin or Hammer hits to make it
 
06:23:17.570 --> 06:23:17.580 align:start position:0%
go boom if they're producing primers and
 
06:23:19.128 --> 06:23:19.138 align:start position:0%
they're selling some of them for you
 
06:23:21.288 --> 06:23:21.298 align:start position:0%
know 20 little 22 Target or not 20
 
06:23:22.490 --> 06:23:22.500 align:start position:0%
spring fire but if they're selling for
 
06:23:23.810 --> 06:23:23.820 align:start position:0%
target practice or if they're selling
 
06:23:26.448 --> 06:23:26.458 align:start position:0%
for armor piercing uranium you know
 
06:23:28.490 --> 06:23:28.500 align:start position:0%
depleted rounds which I've never seen by
 
06:23:29.510 --> 06:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
the way
 
06:23:31.670 --> 06:23:31.680 align:start position:0%
um you know that's still the same thing
 
06:23:33.770 --> 06:23:33.780 align:start position:0%
that could be that could be uh still a
 
06:23:36.110 --> 06:23:36.120 align:start position:0%
felony to do that uh the example of the
 
06:23:38.750 --> 06:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
the person in Las Vegas who sold the uh
 
06:23:41.030 --> 06:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
the armor-piercing ammunition to the Las
 
06:23:43.010 --> 06:23:43.020 align:start position:0%
Vegas shooter uh that person was
 
06:23:45.590 --> 06:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
convicted they pled guilty and did Sir
 
06:23:47.150 --> 06:23:47.160 align:start position:0%
and were sentenced to 13 months in
 
06:23:49.070 --> 06:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
prison they were convicted for
 
06:23:51.650 --> 06:23:51.660 align:start position:0%
manufacturing without a license they
 
06:23:54.410 --> 06:23:54.420 align:start position:0%
weren't convicted for selling it or for
 
06:23:55.850 --> 06:23:55.860 align:start position:0%
armor piercing they said they they
 
06:23:56.810 --> 06:23:56.820 align:start position:0%
weren't even sure if it was armor
 
06:23:58.010 --> 06:23:58.020 align:start position:0%
piercing during the trial the judge
 
06:23:59.270 --> 06:23:59.280 align:start position:0%
ruled it was armor piercing but they
 
06:24:00.230 --> 06:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
didn't prove that any of the bullets
 
06:24:01.970 --> 06:24:01.980 align:start position:0%
came from him I'm not defending this
 
06:24:05.150 --> 06:24:05.160 align:start position:0%
idiot for in any means but he admitted
 
06:24:07.490 --> 06:24:07.500 align:start position:0%
he sold tracers which are just the the
 
06:24:09.650 --> 06:24:09.660 align:start position:0%
bright things that come out you see a
 
06:24:11.150 --> 06:24:11.160 align:start position:0%
machine gun in a movie and it shoots you
 
06:24:12.590 --> 06:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
know one thing you can see and there's a
 
06:24:14.570 --> 06:24:14.580 align:start position:0%
few bullets in between that's so that if
 
06:24:16.010 --> 06:24:16.020 align:start position:0%
someone's shooting an automatic weapon
 
06:24:17.650 --> 06:24:17.660 align:start position:0%
they can see where it's going
 
06:24:20.448 --> 06:24:20.458 align:start position:0%
do are Tracer is coming out of this I
 
06:24:22.128 --> 06:24:22.138 align:start position:0%
don't think they'd even be counted under
 
06:24:24.530 --> 06:24:24.540 align:start position:0%
this the existing set the existing RSA
 
06:24:25.910 --> 06:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
or the amendment
 
06:24:28.970 --> 06:24:28.980 align:start position:0%
um or the the bill and and finally
 
06:24:28.980 --> 06:24:29.990 align:start position:0%
um or the the bill and and finally
um

06:24:29.990 --> 06:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:24:32.330 --> 06:24:32.340 align:start position:0%
you know the amendment that was proposed
 
06:24:33.948 --> 06:24:33.958 align:start position:0%
and we haven't really seen yet exempting
 
06:24:35.750 --> 06:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
Law Enforcement Officers I find that
 
06:24:37.788 --> 06:24:37.798 align:start position:0%
most egregious that you know this is
 
06:24:39.530 --> 06:24:39.540 align:start position:0%
such a heinous thing body parts can
 
06:24:40.910 --> 06:24:40.920 align:start position:0%
explode apparently and all this stuff
 
06:24:43.010 --> 06:24:43.020 align:start position:0%
but the cops can use it on us
 
06:24:44.628 --> 06:24:44.638 align:start position:0%
I think that alone is one of the most
 
06:24:46.070 --> 06:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
scary things I've heard in a long time
 
06:24:47.930 --> 06:24:47.940 align:start position:0%
in this building and uh
 
06:24:50.510 --> 06:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
I I just beg you to just get rid of this
 
06:24:53.570 --> 06:24:53.580 align:start position:0%
as fast as you can and move on be more
 
06:24:54.830 --> 06:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
important things to do thank you very
 
06:24:58.788 --> 06:24:58.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:05.110 --> 06:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:21.708 --> 06:25:21.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:23.690 --> 06:25:23.700 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
06:25:26.690 --> 06:25:26.700 align:start position:0%
committee I actually do have a fair
 
06:25:28.010 --> 06:25:28.020 align:start position:0%
amount of things that have not been
 
06:25:30.830 --> 06:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
addressed uh just by way of background
 
06:25:33.288 --> 06:25:33.298 align:start position:0%
relevant to this hearing I've held a
 
06:25:35.448 --> 06:25:35.458 align:start position:0%
federal firearms license for a few
 
06:25:37.610 --> 06:25:37.620 align:start position:0%
months under 40 years
 
06:25:37.620 --> 06:25:39.048 align:start position:0%
months under 40 years
and

06:25:39.048 --> 06:25:39.058 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:25:39.058 --> 06:25:40.430 align:start position:0%
and
also

06:25:40.430 --> 06:25:40.440 align:start position:0%
also
 
06:25:42.590 --> 06:25:42.600 align:start position:0%
I'm an international economic consultant
 
06:25:45.470 --> 06:25:45.480 align:start position:0%
so I tend to sort of look for data
 
06:25:48.770 --> 06:25:48.780 align:start position:0%
I will do my best not to cover topics
 
06:25:50.390 --> 06:25:50.400 align:start position:0%
already addressed
 
06:25:52.850 --> 06:25:52.860 align:start position:0%
but in some the only possible aim of
 
06:25:56.448 --> 06:25:56.458 align:start position:0%
this bill is to ensnare the law abiding
 
06:25:59.690 --> 06:25:59.700 align:start position:0%
well let me put a sort of a face to that
 
06:26:02.570 --> 06:26:02.580 align:start position:0%
I have in my pocket
 
06:26:04.850 --> 06:26:04.860 align:start position:0%
little card
 
06:26:06.590 --> 06:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
that I'll hold up and if you want me to
 
06:26:09.288 --> 06:26:09.298 align:start position:0%
pass it around I will this is a
 
06:26:09.298 --> 06:26:10.330 align:start position:0%

Massachusetts
 
06:26:14.208 --> 06:26:14.218 align:start position:0%
non-resident license to carry firearms
 
06:26:16.610 --> 06:26:16.620 align:start position:0%
this license or one that
 
06:26:19.490 --> 06:26:19.500 align:start position:0%
its predecessor was wrongly revoked in
 
06:26:22.548 --> 06:26:22.558 align:start position:0%
2009 it took three and a half years of
 
06:26:24.770 --> 06:26:24.780 align:start position:0%
litigation and about a hundred and
 
06:26:27.048 --> 06:26:27.058 align:start position:0%
twenty five thousand dollars before The
 
06:26:29.110 --> 06:26:29.120 align:start position:0%
Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts
 
06:26:31.730 --> 06:26:31.740 align:start position:0%
ordered this license to be restored to
 
06:26:34.730 --> 06:26:34.740 align:start position:0%
me there were at no point any criminal
 
06:26:37.368 --> 06:26:37.378 align:start position:0%
charges filed because I'd broken the law
 
06:26:42.530 --> 06:26:42.540 align:start position:0%
here's my point laws such as this one
 
06:26:44.510 --> 06:26:44.520 align:start position:0%
as everyone has pointed out vaguely
 
06:26:44.520 --> 06:26:46.010 align:start position:0%
as everyone has pointed out vaguely
worded

06:26:46.010 --> 06:26:46.020 align:start position:0%
worded
 
06:26:50.810 --> 06:26:50.820 align:start position:0%
can be used to entrap someone and here's
 
06:26:54.110 --> 06:26:54.120 align:start position:0%
a principle the process is the
 
06:26:54.120 --> 06:26:55.128 align:start position:0%
a principle the process is the
punishment

06:26:55.128 --> 06:26:55.138 align:start position:0%
punishment
 
06:26:58.190 --> 06:26:58.200 align:start position:0%
so even if the person proves that they
 
06:27:01.070 --> 06:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
didn't break the law their meanwhile out
 
06:27:04.910 --> 06:27:04.920 align:start position:0%
tens of thousands of dollars in the case
 
06:27:07.430 --> 06:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
of this law
 
06:27:10.750 --> 06:27:10.760 align:start position:0%
if it is alleged that someone used
 
06:27:13.850 --> 06:27:13.860 align:start position:0%
armor-piercing ammo an expert has to be
 
06:27:13.860 --> 06:27:14.810 align:start position:0%
armor-piercing ammo an expert has to be
hired

06:27:14.810 --> 06:27:14.820 align:start position:0%
hired
 
06:27:18.770 --> 06:27:18.780 align:start position:0%
to say yes it was or no it wasn't that
 
06:27:21.530 --> 06:27:21.540 align:start position:0%
expert five to ten thousand dollars per
 
06:27:23.690 --> 06:27:23.700 align:start position:0%
day plus expenses
 
06:27:27.650 --> 06:27:27.660 align:start position:0%
a lab has to be found to examine the

a lab has to be found to examine the
bullet

06:27:29.208 --> 06:27:29.218 align:start position:0%
bullet
 
06:27:31.548 --> 06:27:31.558 align:start position:0%
they're probably two or three such labs
 
06:27:34.010 --> 06:27:34.020 align:start position:0%
in the entire United States
 
06:27:36.890 --> 06:27:36.900 align:start position:0%
gotta think that's 10 grand
 
06:27:39.288 --> 06:27:39.298 align:start position:0%
and all of those expenses are before
 
06:27:42.590 --> 06:27:42.600 align:start position:0%
hundreds of hours of an attorney's time
 
06:27:45.048 --> 06:27:45.058 align:start position:0%
so that even if the person's eventually
 
06:27:47.448 --> 06:27:47.458 align:start position:0%
exonerated they're bankrupt for the most
 
06:27:47.458 --> 06:27:48.590 align:start position:0%
exonerated they're bankrupt for the most
part

06:27:48.590 --> 06:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
part
 
06:27:50.868 --> 06:27:50.878 align:start position:0%
so anyone who would write a law like
 
06:27:50.878 --> 06:27:52.310 align:start position:0%
so anyone who would write a law like
this

06:27:52.310 --> 06:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:27:55.670 --> 06:27:55.680 align:start position:0%
it's either negligent so gross as to be
 
06:27:58.788 --> 06:27:58.798 align:start position:0%
breathtaking where there's
 
06:28:02.208 --> 06:28:02.218 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:05.090 --> 06:28:05.100 align:start position:0%
sir we we try to avoid um
 
06:28:05.100 --> 06:28:08.628 align:start position:0%
sir we we try to avoid um
casting

06:28:08.628 --> 06:28:08.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:11.570 --> 06:28:11.580 align:start position:0%
uh understood I'm just I just don't want
 
06:28:13.610 --> 06:28:13.620 align:start position:0%
to assign any any um
 
06:28:15.590 --> 06:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
intention to the sponsor I'm sure that
 
06:28:18.890 --> 06:28:18.900 align:start position:0%
this committee will take take his uh his
 
06:28:20.930 --> 06:28:20.940 align:start position:0%
word that it was for the protection of
 
06:28:23.330 --> 06:28:23.340 align:start position:0%
law enforcement and we'll uh
 
06:28:24.890 --> 06:28:24.900 align:start position:0%
go on from there
 
06:28:28.128 --> 06:28:28.138 align:start position:0%
you've already heard that
 
06:28:30.410 --> 06:28:30.420 align:start position:0%
most common ammunition will penetrate
 
06:28:30.420 --> 06:28:33.230 align:start position:0%
most common ammunition will penetrate
vests

06:28:33.230 --> 06:28:33.240 align:start position:0%
vests
 
06:28:34.730 --> 06:28:34.740 align:start position:0%
I will not
 
06:28:37.310 --> 06:28:37.320 align:start position:0%
belabor that what I will tell you which
 
06:28:38.690 --> 06:28:38.700 align:start position:0%
is new
 
06:28:42.128 --> 06:28:42.138 align:start position:0%
that I can find no evidence that
 
06:28:45.288 --> 06:28:45.298 align:start position:0%
armor-piercing ammunition has figured in
 
06:28:47.810 --> 06:28:47.820 align:start position:0%
the death of any New Hampshire peace
 
06:28:47.820 --> 06:28:49.190 align:start position:0%
the death of any New Hampshire peace
officer

06:28:49.190 --> 06:28:49.200 align:start position:0%
officer
 
06:28:52.910 --> 06:28:52.920 align:start position:0%
and I actually prepare on the third page
 
06:28:55.490 --> 06:28:55.500 align:start position:0%
of my submitted testimony a list of
 
06:28:58.610 --> 06:28:58.620 align:start position:0%
officers killed in line of duty from
 
06:29:01.910 --> 06:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
1928 to 2014.
 
06:29:05.150 --> 06:29:05.160 align:start position:0%
and I hope this list never grows
 
06:29:09.470 --> 06:29:09.480 align:start position:0%
some of them sadly were shot in the head
 
06:29:12.048 --> 06:29:12.058 align:start position:0%
a vest isn't relevant in armor isn't
 
06:29:12.058 --> 06:29:14.030 align:start position:0%
a vest isn't relevant in armor isn't
relevant

06:29:14.030 --> 06:29:14.040 align:start position:0%
relevant
 
06:29:17.030 --> 06:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
some were shot through their vests
 
06:29:20.990 --> 06:29:21.000 align:start position:0%
I give you enough detail so in short
 
06:29:23.208 --> 06:29:23.218 align:start position:0%
the contingency
 
06:29:27.708 --> 06:29:27.718 align:start position:0%
suggested by this bill is that
 
06:29:30.770 --> 06:29:30.780 align:start position:0%
this is something that
 
06:29:33.110 --> 06:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
perhaps has happened not in New
 
06:29:33.120 --> 06:29:35.390 align:start position:0%
perhaps has happened not in New
Hampshire

06:29:35.390 --> 06:29:35.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:39.470 --> 06:29:39.480 align:start position:0%
I didn't go back prior to 1928
 
06:29:42.470 --> 06:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
because my best guess is and it's only a
 
06:29:42.480 --> 06:29:43.310 align:start position:0%
because my best guess is and it's only a
guess

06:29:43.310 --> 06:29:43.320 align:start position:0%
guess
 
06:29:45.890 --> 06:29:45.900 align:start position:0%
the armor the only armor-piercing ground
 
06:29:47.930 --> 06:29:47.940 align:start position:0%
that might have existed prior to that
 
06:29:51.048 --> 06:29:51.058 align:start position:0%
date is the 30 odd six round carried in
 
06:29:52.610 --> 06:29:52.620 align:start position:0%
World War One
 
06:29:56.990 --> 06:29:57.000 align:start position:0%
that round comes into from a military
 
06:29:59.330 --> 06:29:59.340 align:start position:0%
point of view in two ways a standard
 
06:30:02.390 --> 06:30:02.400 align:start position:0%
Lead Core and a steel core that is
 
06:30:05.390 --> 06:30:05.400 align:start position:0%
hardened the steel core which is
 
06:30:07.128 --> 06:30:07.138 align:start position:0%
normally in the military is the black
 
06:30:07.138 --> 06:30:08.390 align:start position:0%
normally in the military is the black
tip

06:30:08.390 --> 06:30:08.400 align:start position:0%
tip
 
06:30:11.868 --> 06:30:11.878 align:start position:0%
so that it is known what it is
 
06:30:15.890 --> 06:30:15.900 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:18.288 --> 06:30:18.298 align:start position:0%
um standard ball ammunition has a plain
 
06:30:21.288 --> 06:30:21.298 align:start position:0%
copper coating and for your background
 
06:30:24.350 --> 06:30:24.360 align:start position:0%
for those of you who need it I explain
 
06:30:28.250 --> 06:30:28.260 align:start position:0%
why military spec ammo consists of a
 
06:30:31.610 --> 06:30:31.620 align:start position:0%
Lead Core and a thick copper foil jacket
 
06:30:34.670 --> 06:30:34.680 align:start position:0%
it is to prevent
 
06:30:38.090 --> 06:30:38.100 align:start position:0%
wounds that cannot be easily repaired
 
06:30:41.090 --> 06:30:41.100 align:start position:0%
and that is under the 1899 Hague
 
06:30:45.048 --> 06:30:45.058 align:start position:0%
convention so almost spec ammo
 
06:30:47.510 --> 06:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
with rare exceptions
 
06:30:53.170 --> 06:30:53.180 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:55.430 --> 06:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
the other
 
06:30:58.010 --> 06:30:58.020 align:start position:0%
set of data that I present to you is on
 
06:30:59.628 --> 06:30:59.638 align:start position:0%
page four
 
06:31:02.628 --> 06:31:02.638 align:start position:0%
it shows the incidence of violent crime
 
06:31:05.330 --> 06:31:05.340 align:start position:0%
in the New England region all five
 
06:31:05.340 --> 06:31:06.708 align:start position:0%
in the New England region all five
states

06:31:06.708 --> 06:31:06.718 align:start position:0%
states
 
06:31:09.230 --> 06:31:09.240 align:start position:0%
Virginia is there by the way because in
 
06:31:12.590 --> 06:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
2015 the Virginians knocked us New
 
06:31:15.770 --> 06:31:15.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire people out of our position at
 
06:31:18.708 --> 06:31:18.718 align:start position:0%
least since 2001 as the third safest
 
06:31:22.548 --> 06:31:22.558 align:start position:0%
state in the Union we are now number two
 
06:31:22.558 --> 06:31:23.868 align:start position:0%
state in the Union we are now number two
the

06:31:23.868 --> 06:31:23.878 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:31:26.628 --> 06:31:26.638 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason or sets of reasons
 
06:31:29.990 --> 06:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
we are not much given to doing
 
06:31:32.510 --> 06:31:32.520 align:start position:0%
business violently
 
06:31:36.230 --> 06:31:36.240 align:start position:0%
and I hope that Trend continues I wish I
 
06:31:39.230 --> 06:31:39.240 align:start position:0%
had data for 2021 I don't
 
06:31:40.670 --> 06:31:40.680 align:start position:0%
in short
 
06:31:44.150 --> 06:31:44.160 align:start position:0%
this bill and any variant of it please
 
06:31:47.930 --> 06:31:47.940 align:start position:0%
deem it in expedient to legislate
 
06:31:50.530 --> 06:31:50.540 align:start position:0%
I have with me if anyone wants to see
 
06:31:55.850 --> 06:31:55.860 align:start position:0%
two cartridges 762 by 39 which was the
 
06:31:58.670 --> 06:31:58.680 align:start position:0%
round commonly used by Russia and
 
06:32:01.670 --> 06:32:01.680 align:start position:0%
Eastern Bloc countries one of which has
 
06:32:04.970 --> 06:32:04.980 align:start position:0%
a steel core it is not hardened but the
 
06:32:07.128 --> 06:32:07.138 align:start position:0%
Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco firearms and
 
06:32:11.208 --> 06:32:11.218 align:start position:0%
explosives deems it to be armor-piercing
 
06:32:13.910 --> 06:32:13.920 align:start position:0%
I can possess that ammo
 
06:32:16.730 --> 06:32:16.740 align:start position:0%
I can't sell it so if I want to go to
 
06:32:18.650 --> 06:32:18.660 align:start position:0%
the range and expend it I am free to do
 
06:32:18.660 --> 06:32:19.610 align:start position:0%
the range and expend it I am free to do
that

06:32:19.610 --> 06:32:19.620 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:32:21.830 --> 06:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
but there is no amount of money to be
 
06:32:24.170 --> 06:32:24.180 align:start position:0%
found in this part of the Galaxy that
 
06:32:25.850 --> 06:32:25.860 align:start position:0%
will tempt me to sell even a single
 
06:32:25.860 --> 06:32:27.110 align:start position:0%
will tempt me to sell even a single
round

06:32:27.110 --> 06:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
round
 
06:32:30.590 --> 06:32:30.600 align:start position:0%
I have another round same chambering
 
06:32:33.170 --> 06:32:33.180 align:start position:0%
the rounds look identical but it has a
 
06:32:35.930 --> 06:32:35.940 align:start position:0%
Lead Core are we going to require police
 
06:32:38.510 --> 06:32:38.520 align:start position:0%
officers to add to their Duty belts
 
06:32:38.520 --> 06:32:40.490 align:start position:0%
officers to add to their Duty belts
hacksaws

06:32:40.490 --> 06:32:40.500 align:start position:0%
hacksaws
 
06:32:43.430 --> 06:32:43.440 align:start position:0%
so that if they can't saw through the
 
06:32:45.170 --> 06:32:45.180 align:start position:0%
bullet well it must have a hardened
 
06:32:47.868 --> 06:32:47.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:49.730 --> 06:32:49.740 align:start position:0%
most officers I think will tell you we
 
06:32:51.830 --> 06:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
have enough stuff on our duty belts we
 
06:32:53.990 --> 06:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
don't want to have to carry a hacksaw
 
06:32:57.948 --> 06:32:57.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:59.990 --> 06:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
thank you and and we appreciate your
 
06:33:02.810 --> 06:33:02.820 align:start position:0%
offer but we generally frown on Show and
 
06:33:06.350 --> 06:33:06.360 align:start position:0%
Tell during Firearms days but thank you
 
06:33:07.570 --> 06:33:07.580 align:start position:0%
for your testimony
 
06:33:10.070 --> 06:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
06:33:11.810 --> 06:33:11.820 align:start position:0%
committee for your time
 
06:33:13.730 --> 06:33:13.740 align:start position:0%
and if any of you have follow-up

United States Supreme Court and I'm
 
06:33:59.930 --> 06:33:59.940 align:start position:0%
asking that you itl this bill it is
 
06:34:02.270 --> 06:34:02.280 align:start position:0%
going to be void for vagueness on its
 
06:34:04.670 --> 06:34:04.680 align:start position:0%
face I think if challenged the basic
 
06:34:06.470 --> 06:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
reason is well there's many reasons but
 
06:34:08.030 --> 06:34:08.040 align:start position:0%
the basic reason is
 
06:34:10.490 --> 06:34:10.500 align:start position:0%
the sponsor said it's simple it's not
 
06:34:12.708 --> 06:34:12.718 align:start position:0%
even close to simple
 
06:34:15.650 --> 06:34:15.660 align:start position:0%
the term vest
 
06:34:17.868 --> 06:34:17.878 align:start position:0%
and I've just given you some real basics
 
06:34:20.570 --> 06:34:20.580 align:start position:0%
in my handout
 
06:34:23.090 --> 06:34:23.100 align:start position:0%
when they talk about design to penetrate
 
06:34:25.490 --> 06:34:25.500 align:start position:0%
armor plating or ballistic vests there's
 
06:34:26.810 --> 06:34:26.820 align:start position:0%
a million different versions of
 
06:34:29.570 --> 06:34:29.580 align:start position:0%
ballistic best and I won't belabor the
 
06:34:32.390 --> 06:34:32.400 align:start position:0%
point but the gist of it is it's going
 
06:34:35.208 --> 06:34:35.218 align:start position:0%
to matter if a vest is New Old what
 
06:34:38.270 --> 06:34:38.280 align:start position:0%
grade most people have not tested vests
 
06:34:40.310 --> 06:34:40.320 align:start position:0%
I have I've tested many vests at the
 
06:34:42.288 --> 06:34:42.298 align:start position:0%
range with many different capabilities
 
06:34:45.110 --> 06:34:45.120 align:start position:0%
and if you take some officers that wash
 
06:34:47.390 --> 06:34:47.400 align:start position:0%
their vest if you wash your vest it
 
06:34:50.270 --> 06:34:50.280 align:start position:0%
destroys the properties so those I'm not
 
06:34:52.190 --> 06:34:52.200 align:start position:0%
sure the kids BB gun couldn't penetrate
 
06:34:55.070 --> 06:34:55.080 align:start position:0%
so in short I won't belabor what
 
06:34:56.570 --> 06:34:56.580 align:start position:0%
everyone else has said I'm happy to
 
06:34:58.910 --> 06:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
answer questions but I passed out two
 
06:35:00.650 --> 06:35:00.660 align:start position:0%
particular handouts that show there's
 
06:35:03.470 --> 06:35:03.480 align:start position:0%
more than a dozen different standards
 
06:35:06.048 --> 06:35:06.058 align:start position:0%
for best FBI uniform and the National
 
06:35:09.110 --> 06:35:09.120 align:start position:0%
Institute of justice and those change I
 
06:35:11.150 --> 06:35:11.160 align:start position:0%
didn't give out you the entire handout
 
06:35:12.770 --> 06:35:12.780 align:start position:0%
for each one I gave you select Pages
 
06:35:15.350 --> 06:35:15.360 align:start position:0%
because each one is about 100 pages and
 
06:35:16.970 --> 06:35:16.980 align:start position:0%
most people other than the weird Geeks
 
06:35:19.368 --> 06:35:19.378 align:start position:0%
like me don't want to read them and each
 
06:35:21.948 --> 06:35:21.958 align:start position:0%
one of those has probably a thousand
 
06:35:24.288 --> 06:35:24.298 align:start position:0%
pages of backup of government statistics
 
06:35:28.010 --> 06:35:28.020 align:start position:0%
and so in short there's probably not a
 
06:35:30.650 --> 06:35:30.660 align:start position:0%
round out there for rifles that wouldn't
 
06:35:32.030 --> 06:35:32.040 align:start position:0%
be banned here
 
06:35:35.030 --> 06:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
and it's just like Banning gasoline for
 
06:35:36.948 --> 06:35:36.958 align:start position:0%
an internal combustion engine you could
 
06:35:38.448 --> 06:35:38.458 align:start position:0%
have a million cars but if you can't get
 
06:35:40.910 --> 06:35:40.920 align:start position:0%
any gasoline no point in having them
 
06:35:44.270 --> 06:35:44.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:50.570 --> 06:35:50.580 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:57.830 --> 06:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:00.410 --> 06:36:00.420 align:start position:0%

here representing myself my constituents
 
06:36:14.990 --> 06:36:15.000 align:start position:0%

06:36:19.740 --> 06:36:20.628 align:start position:0%
non-profit that is
um

06:36:20.628 --> 06:36:20.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:36:22.788 --> 06:36:22.798 align:start position:0%
built up or is made up of people that
 
06:36:24.970 --> 06:36:24.980 align:start position:0%
are both gun owners gun manufacturers
 
06:36:29.208 --> 06:36:29.218 align:start position:0%
ammunition manufacturers and sporting
 
06:36:31.610 --> 06:36:31.620 align:start position:0%
clubs within the state
 
06:36:33.948 --> 06:36:33.958 align:start position:0%
um the bill before you
 
06:36:36.350 --> 06:36:36.360 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm at a loss of words how egregious
 
06:36:37.368 --> 06:36:37.378 align:start position:0%
it is
 
06:36:37.378 --> 06:36:38.150 align:start position:0%
it is
um

06:36:38.150 --> 06:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:36:39.948 --> 06:36:39.958 align:start position:0%
it seems simple
 
06:36:41.510 --> 06:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
seems like this shouldn't be a problem
 
06:36:43.070 --> 06:36:43.080 align:start position:0%
except we're going to turn almost all
 
06:36:44.628 --> 06:36:44.638 align:start position:0%
the hunters in the state in the class B
 
06:36:46.490 --> 06:36:46.500 align:start position:0%
felons and maybe maybe that was the
 
06:36:48.770 --> 06:36:48.780 align:start position:0%
intent of the sponsors I don't I suspect
 
06:36:50.510 --> 06:36:50.520 align:start position:0%
that wasn't the intent of the sponsors
 
06:36:53.330 --> 06:36:53.340 align:start position:0%
but that's what it would do before you
 
06:36:56.150 --> 06:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
is a box of hunting ammo
 
06:36:57.590 --> 06:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
I wish I had more time to be in the
 
06:36:59.150 --> 06:36:59.160 align:start position:0%
woods I missed spending my time with my
 
06:37:01.250 --> 06:37:01.260 align:start position:0%
308 but this is 308 ammunition standard
 
06:37:02.868 --> 06:37:02.878 align:start position:0%
hunting ammunition
 
06:37:04.788 --> 06:37:04.798 align:start position:0%
has pictures of little animals on the
 
06:37:07.190 --> 06:37:07.200 align:start position:0%
back right for use for Dangerous Game
 
06:37:09.350 --> 06:37:09.360 align:start position:0%
and big game and medium game and even
 
06:37:11.330 --> 06:37:11.340 align:start position:0%
environments representative just I don't
 
06:37:13.190 --> 06:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
interrupt your flow there but please
 
06:37:15.170 --> 06:37:15.180 align:start position:0%
leave it in the Box oh yes no I'm not
 
06:37:17.510 --> 06:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
pulling it out I brought the box there
 
06:37:19.788 --> 06:37:19.798 align:start position:0%
is rounds in it but um for the purpose
 
06:37:22.910 --> 06:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
of having a conversation right this is
 
06:37:24.470 --> 06:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
hunting ammo
 
06:37:27.770 --> 06:37:27.780 align:start position:0%
this is routine 308 Winchester hunting
 
06:37:29.930 --> 06:37:29.940 align:start position:0%
ammo use all the day in the woods
 
06:37:33.170 --> 06:37:33.180 align:start position:0%
happens to have the same form and more
 
06:37:35.390 --> 06:37:35.400 align:start position:0%
or less the same specifications as 761
 
06:37:38.750 --> 06:37:38.760 align:start position:0%
by 52 millimeter
 
06:37:40.368 --> 06:37:40.378 align:start position:0%
um NATO ammo
 
06:37:42.170 --> 06:37:42.180 align:start position:0%
they're used interchangially in most
 
06:37:45.170 --> 06:37:45.180 align:start position:0%
Firearms my point there is the the this
 
06:37:47.510 --> 06:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
bill is drafted so poorly that you could
 
06:37:50.030 --> 06:37:50.040 align:start position:0%
easily turn people into felons just
 
06:37:51.410 --> 06:37:51.420 align:start position:0%
because they happen to have the wrong
 
06:37:53.030 --> 06:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
ammo that interchangeably works with
 
06:37:54.470 --> 06:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
their firearm
 
06:37:56.510 --> 06:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
I would ask that you would IP this itl
 
06:37:58.368 --> 06:37:58.378 align:start position:0%
this bill um there is no reason for us
 
06:37:59.810 --> 06:37:59.820 align:start position:0%
to spend any more time on it it really
 
06:38:02.810 --> 06:38:02.820 align:start position:0%
should just go away and
 
06:38:02.820 --> 06:38:03.530 align:start position:0%
should just go away and
um

06:38:03.530 --> 06:38:03.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:38:05.448 --> 06:38:05.458 align:start position:0%
it was never about protecting the police
 
06:38:06.830 --> 06:38:06.840 align:start position:0%
which is where I saw a bunch of Facebook
 
06:38:10.548 --> 06:38:10.558 align:start position:0%
messages this was an attempt to band of
 
06:38:12.830 --> 06:38:12.840 align:start position:0%
various a number of various forms of
 
06:38:15.410 --> 06:38:15.420 align:start position:0%
ammo thank you
 
06:38:15.420 --> 06:38:21.250 align:start position:0%
ammo thank you
foreign

06:38:21.250 --> 06:38:21.260 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:25.010 --> 06:38:25.020 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:26.990 --> 06:38:27.000 align:start position:0%
for the record I would I would like to
 
06:38:29.750 --> 06:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
say that as far as this committee goes
 
06:38:32.330 --> 06:38:32.340 align:start position:0%
we take the sponsor at his word and his
 
06:38:34.150 --> 06:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
goal was to protect police officers
 
06:38:36.350 --> 06:38:36.360 align:start position:0%
regardless of how you come down on the
 
06:38:39.230 --> 06:38:39.240 align:start position:0%
bill itself and with that I will close
 
06:38:42.048 --> 06:38:42.058 align:start position:0%
the public hearing
 
06:38:45.310 --> 06:38:45.320 align:start position:0%
and the next public hearing is
 
06:38:49.250 --> 06:38:49.260 align:start position:0%
hb503 I'm going to take a short uh seven
 
06:38:51.350 --> 06:38:51.360 align:start position:0%
minute break bio break
 
06:38:59.810 --> 06:38:59.820 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:01.970 --> 06:39:01.980 align:start position:0%
who did
 
06:39:03.410 --> 06:39:03.420 align:start position:0%
oh that lady that lady was up here with
 
06:39:06.110 --> 06:39:06.120 align:start position:0%
all crying face lady she gave us a fake
 
06:39:08.750 --> 06:39:08.760 align:start position:0%
name who found her
 
06:39:13.190 --> 06:39:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:15.548 --> 06:39:15.558 align:start position:0%
what's that what's her name
 
06:39:18.590 --> 06:39:18.600 align:start position:0%
her name's not Katie University yeah she
 
06:51:40.490 --> 06:51:40.500 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:42.230 --> 06:51:42.240 align:start position:0%
thank you at this time I'm open to
 
06:51:45.350 --> 06:51:45.360 align:start position:0%
public hearing on HP 503 and call the
 
06:51:48.650 --> 06:51:48.660 align:start position:0%
sponsor to introduce bill
 
06:51:48.660 --> 06:51:54.770 align:start position:0%
sponsor to introduce bill
hmm

06:51:54.770 --> 06:51:54.780 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:57.048 --> 06:51:57.058 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman uh Dan Hines on
 
06:52:00.350 --> 06:52:00.360 align:start position:0%
behalf of uh Bedford um Bedford and just
 
06:52:01.730 --> 06:52:01.740 align:start position:0%
by way background because once when I
 
06:52:03.410 --> 06:52:03.420 align:start position:0%
forget I am a criminal defense lawyer um
 
06:52:05.930 --> 06:52:05.940 align:start position:0%
so I do know a lot about this issue and
 
06:52:08.150 --> 06:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
so unfortunately this is a pretty broad
 
06:52:09.890 --> 06:52:09.900 align:start position:0%
issue I am covering a lot of different
 
06:52:11.628 --> 06:52:11.638 align:start position:0%
things what I'm attempting to do is
 
06:52:14.390 --> 06:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
provide more rights to accused so some
 
06:52:16.430 --> 06:52:16.440 align:start position:0%
of this is kind of codifying or making
 
06:52:19.070 --> 06:52:19.080 align:start position:0%
more explicit things that sort of are in
 
06:52:21.650 --> 06:52:21.660 align:start position:0%
case law so just by way of background so
 
06:52:23.990 --> 06:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Constitution is my
 
06:52:26.090 --> 06:52:26.100 align:start position:0%
opinion very very favorable to people
 
06:52:28.968 --> 06:52:28.978 align:start position:0%
accused of a crime so Article 15 says
 
06:52:30.948 --> 06:52:30.958 align:start position:0%
that everyone accused of a crime has all
 
06:52:32.570 --> 06:52:32.580 align:start position:0%
proofs has the right to all proofs
 
06:52:35.090 --> 06:52:35.100 align:start position:0%
favorable media as a defense lawyer
 
06:52:37.968 --> 06:52:37.978 align:start position:0%
means everything that is in any form
 
06:52:40.368 --> 06:52:40.378 align:start position:0%
exculpatory I should be given
 
06:52:41.810 --> 06:52:41.820 align:start position:0%
um and generally speaking should be
 
06:52:44.330 --> 06:52:44.340 align:start position:0%
admissible as evidence absent some other
 
06:52:46.730 --> 06:52:46.740 align:start position:0%
I guess exception forsake a better word
 
06:52:49.128 --> 06:52:49.138 align:start position:0%
so a lot of these things addressed here
 
06:52:52.010 --> 06:52:52.020 align:start position:0%
would go to what I think is just
 
06:52:53.750 --> 06:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
inherent in our system that if you're
 
06:52:55.490 --> 06:52:55.500 align:start position:0%
going to accuse someone of crime and you
 
06:52:57.170 --> 06:52:57.180 align:start position:0%
have evidence showing their innocence
 
06:52:59.208 --> 06:52:59.218 align:start position:0%
that that person is entitled to that and
 
06:53:00.890 --> 06:53:00.900 align:start position:0%
they're entitled to present that to
 
06:53:03.410 --> 06:53:03.420 align:start position:0%
either the jury or the judge so I just
 
06:53:04.670 --> 06:53:04.680 align:start position:0%
because it is a lot of different things
 
06:53:06.890 --> 06:53:06.900 align:start position:0%
let's go through one by one what this
 
06:53:08.930 --> 06:53:08.940 align:start position:0%
bill would do um so the first one is I'm
 
06:53:11.270 --> 06:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
trying to get a speedy trial so while
 
06:53:13.368 --> 06:53:13.378 align:start position:0%
there's a right to a speedy trial and
 
06:53:15.170 --> 06:53:15.180 align:start position:0%
it's a constitutional right under the
 
06:53:17.750 --> 06:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
Constitution the Federal Constitution I
 
06:53:19.128 --> 06:53:19.138 align:start position:0%
think in my opinion it's absolutely
 
06:53:22.368 --> 06:53:22.378 align:start position:0%
worthless in this state I've had very
 
06:53:25.010 --> 06:53:25.020 align:start position:0%
few cases dismissed over more than a
 
06:53:26.868 --> 06:53:26.878 align:start position:0%
decade on speedy trial grounds and in
 
06:53:28.548 --> 06:53:28.558 align:start position:0%
every single one of those cases has
 
06:53:31.368 --> 06:53:31.378 align:start position:0%
begun is because either the witness it's
 
06:53:33.288 --> 06:53:33.298 align:start position:0%
basically because the state was unable
 
06:53:34.310 --> 06:53:34.320 align:start position:0%
to proceed with the case because the
 
06:53:35.930 --> 06:53:35.940 align:start position:0%
witness didn't show up I have a raised
 
06:53:38.270 --> 06:53:38.280 align:start position:0%
speedy trial and many times always been
 
06:53:38.280 --> 06:53:39.288 align:start position:0%
speedy trial and many times always been
denied

06:53:39.288 --> 06:53:39.298 align:start position:0%
denied
 
06:53:42.708 --> 06:53:42.718 align:start position:0%
um case law in this state is not good
 
06:53:45.170 --> 06:53:45.180 align:start position:0%
um so offhand I believe like nine months
 
06:53:46.670 --> 06:53:46.680 align:start position:0%
is sort of a triggering mark where
 
06:53:48.288 --> 06:53:48.298 align:start position:0%
you're not even gonna be able to argue
 
06:53:50.030 --> 06:53:50.040 align:start position:0%
it for misdemeanor cases prior to mine
 
06:53:52.310 --> 06:53:52.320 align:start position:0%
months and in my experience when I've
 
06:53:54.350 --> 06:53:54.360 align:start position:0%
argueded it after nine months the court
 
06:53:56.930 --> 06:53:56.940 align:start position:0%
basically quickly said well they'll find
 
06:53:58.670 --> 06:53:58.680 align:start position:0%
whatever reason it is not to dismiss
 
06:54:01.788 --> 06:54:01.798 align:start position:0%
cases on a speedy trial and I understand
 
06:54:03.170 --> 06:54:03.180 align:start position:0%
um we generally don't want cases
 
06:54:05.448 --> 06:54:05.458 align:start position:0%
dismissed for Speed trial because a lot
 
06:54:07.490 --> 06:54:07.500 align:start position:0%
of people who ultimately be found guilty
 
06:54:09.890 --> 06:54:09.900 align:start position:0%
will be set free that way what I want to
 
06:54:12.350 --> 06:54:12.360 align:start position:0%
do is actually give someone a speedy
 
06:54:14.930 --> 06:54:14.940 align:start position:0%
trial so I was just reading the case in
 
06:54:16.250 --> 06:54:16.260 align:start position:0%
the news I believe it was last month
 
06:54:18.350 --> 06:54:18.360 align:start position:0%
where someone had to wait over three
 
06:54:21.230 --> 06:54:21.240 align:start position:0%
years for a trial given as a murder case
 
06:54:23.330 --> 06:54:23.340 align:start position:0%
but I still think three years and
 
06:54:24.830 --> 06:54:24.840 align:start position:0%
there's nothing Speedy about three years
 
06:54:26.330 --> 06:54:26.340 align:start position:0%
especially when you're being held
 
06:54:30.530 --> 06:54:30.540 align:start position:0%
pre-trial on simple misdemeanor cases
 
06:54:31.968 --> 06:54:31.978 align:start position:0%
um so pretty much mainly what I do is
 
06:54:33.948 --> 06:54:33.958 align:start position:0%
DWI defense and so those are class B
 
06:54:35.868 --> 06:54:35.878 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors meaning that someone can't
 
06:54:39.350 --> 06:54:39.360 align:start position:0%
be sent to jail for it but if convicted
 
06:54:41.150 --> 06:54:41.160 align:start position:0%
there is a mandatory license suspension
 
06:54:41.160 --> 06:54:42.530 align:start position:0%
there is a mandatory license suspension
and

06:54:42.530 --> 06:54:42.540 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:54:44.628 --> 06:54:44.638 align:start position:0%
um just by way background I've suggest
 
06:54:46.190 --> 06:54:46.200 align:start position:0%
that pretty much everyone who's charged
 
06:54:49.010 --> 06:54:49.020 align:start position:0%
with a crime it's it's not just when
 
06:54:50.330 --> 06:54:50.340 align:start position:0%
even when they're released that their
 
06:54:51.890 --> 06:54:51.900 align:start position:0%
life just goes back to normal I mean
 
06:54:53.690 --> 06:54:53.700 align:start position:0%
it's incredibly stressful to be waiting
 
06:54:55.610 --> 06:54:55.620 align:start position:0%
not knowing worrying about the outcome
 
06:54:57.610 --> 06:54:57.620 align:start position:0%
and everything that goes along with it
 
06:55:00.288 --> 06:55:00.298 align:start position:0%
so getting back to what I was saying in
 
06:55:02.868 --> 06:55:02.878 align:start position:0%
a lot of cases I'm not seeing trials in
 
06:55:04.850 --> 06:55:04.860 align:start position:0%
District Court for even a year still
 
06:55:07.270 --> 06:55:07.280 align:start position:0%
some course a lot better than others
 
06:55:10.670 --> 06:55:10.680 align:start position:0%
there's certainly a problem and I know
 
06:55:12.350 --> 06:55:12.360 align:start position:0%
Bell reform
 
06:55:13.730 --> 06:55:13.740 align:start position:0%
um being
 
06:55:15.650 --> 06:55:15.660 align:start position:0%
brought in from both this committee and
 
06:55:17.628 --> 06:55:17.638 align:start position:0%
Judiciary one of the things that I see
 
06:55:20.208 --> 06:55:20.218 align:start position:0%
people want out of bailware forum most
 
06:55:21.830 --> 06:55:21.840 align:start position:0%
is the complaint that hey these people
 
06:55:24.048 --> 06:55:24.058 align:start position:0%
are out on bail they're committing more
 
06:55:26.330 --> 06:55:26.340 align:start position:0%
crimes I think the best solution to that
 
06:55:28.548 --> 06:55:28.558 align:start position:0%
is short in the trial have people out on
 
06:55:32.208 --> 06:55:32.218 align:start position:0%
bail less a shorter trial is just good
 
06:55:33.830 --> 06:55:33.840 align:start position:0%
for everyone it's good for people who
 
06:55:35.750 --> 06:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
are going to be found not guilty they'll
 
06:55:37.850 --> 06:55:37.860 align:start position:0%
be set free and it's good for society if
 
06:55:39.170 --> 06:55:39.180 align:start position:0%
someone's found guilty to have that
 
06:55:41.030 --> 06:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
person punished in a timely fashion
 
06:55:43.730 --> 06:55:43.740 align:start position:0%
rather than a year or more down the line
 
06:55:46.910 --> 06:55:46.920 align:start position:0%
so I propose what I think is some
 
06:55:49.250 --> 06:55:49.260 align:start position:0%
guideline or essentially what I think
 
06:55:51.048 --> 06:55:51.058 align:start position:0%
would make a speedy trial I just picked
 
06:55:53.270 --> 06:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
90 days I just picked that if the
 
06:55:54.708 --> 06:55:54.718 align:start position:0%
committee feels it's more an appropriate
 
06:55:57.110 --> 06:55:57.120 align:start position:0%
time for some other period frankly
 
06:55:58.730 --> 06:55:58.740 align:start position:0%
anything is going to be better than what
 
06:56:01.190 --> 06:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
we have now it's absolutely awful and I
 
06:56:04.128 --> 06:56:04.138 align:start position:0%
think the main issue now of why trials
 
06:56:06.650 --> 06:56:06.660 align:start position:0%
are just so long out just the lack of
 
06:56:08.810 --> 06:56:08.820 align:start position:0%
resources so some courts are a lot
 
06:56:10.730 --> 06:56:10.740 align:start position:0%
better but there's really not my opinion
 
06:56:14.628 --> 06:56:14.638 align:start position:0%
a uniform speedy trial in this state so
 
06:56:17.030 --> 06:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
part of what my bill did is increases
 
06:56:19.310 --> 06:56:19.320 align:start position:0%
the penalty assessment uh which I tell
 
06:56:21.230 --> 06:56:21.240 align:start position:0%
my clients is a fancy way of saying tax
 
06:56:23.690 --> 06:56:23.700 align:start position:0%
so rather than legislature increase the
 
06:56:25.430 --> 06:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
fines and all the cases this increased
 
06:56:26.750 --> 06:56:26.760 align:start position:0%
penalty assessment which essentially
 
06:56:28.788 --> 06:56:28.798 align:start position:0%
increases fines on all cases so
 
06:56:31.490 --> 06:56:31.500 align:start position:0%
presently it's set to 24 uh when I first
 
06:56:32.810 --> 06:56:32.820 align:start position:0%
started practicing law I was set to 20
 
06:56:34.430 --> 06:56:34.440 align:start position:0%
so it does get increased occasionally
 
06:56:36.770 --> 06:56:36.780 align:start position:0%
and I'm asking that it be increased
 
06:56:39.288 --> 06:56:39.298 align:start position:0%
further with the intent that that money
 
06:56:42.410 --> 06:56:42.420 align:start position:0%
is mainly going to judges and in
 
06:56:42.420 --> 06:56:44.410 align:start position:0%
is mainly going to judges and in
essentially

06:56:44.410 --> 06:56:44.420 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
06:56:46.788 --> 06:56:46.798 align:start position:0%
giving people the speedy trial that they
 
06:56:48.830 --> 06:56:48.840 align:start position:0%
need and some of the other money is
 
06:56:51.830 --> 06:56:51.840 align:start position:0%
being earmarked for the State Crime Lab
 
06:56:53.628 --> 06:56:53.638 align:start position:0%
um which one of the things in my bill is
 
06:56:55.730 --> 06:56:55.740 align:start position:0%
the preservation of evidence so what
 
06:56:58.010 --> 06:56:58.020 align:start position:0%
happens in DWI cases if someone gives a
 
06:57:00.948 --> 06:57:00.958 align:start position:0%
blood jaw is that blood is sent to the
 
06:57:02.990 --> 06:57:03.000 align:start position:0%
crime lab the crime lab eventually
 
06:57:05.628 --> 06:57:05.638 align:start position:0%
analyzes it and frankly this isn't at
 
06:57:07.850 --> 06:57:07.860 align:start position:0%
the top of the list so it just depends
 
06:57:10.368 --> 06:57:10.378 align:start position:0%
on how busy they are at the time but
 
06:57:12.830 --> 06:57:12.840 align:start position:0%
routinely the lab does not give me
 
06:57:15.590 --> 06:57:15.600 align:start position:0%
results Within a month so it's my
 
06:57:17.208 --> 06:57:17.218 align:start position:0%
anticipation some of this money will
 
06:57:20.150 --> 06:57:20.160 align:start position:0%
increase the lab to have them hire more
 
06:57:20.160 --> 06:57:21.310 align:start position:0%
increase the lab to have them hire more
people

06:57:21.310 --> 06:57:21.320 align:start position:0%
people
 
06:57:24.708 --> 06:57:24.718 align:start position:0%
and the other problem is the lab does
 
06:57:27.410 --> 06:57:27.420 align:start position:0%
not store blood in cases so specifically
 
06:57:29.990 --> 06:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
a statute that says the lab can destroy
 
06:57:32.330 --> 06:57:32.340 align:start position:0%
the blood after 30 days I'm never
 
06:57:35.810 --> 06:57:35.820 align:start position:0%
getting a trial within 30 days so the
 
06:57:37.610 --> 06:57:37.620 align:start position:0%
lab while they can destroy in 30 days
 
06:57:40.070 --> 06:57:40.080 align:start position:0%
it's my experience they destroy it as
 
06:57:42.410 --> 06:57:42.420 align:start position:0%
they're full so that could be six months
 
06:57:43.990 --> 06:57:44.000 align:start position:0%
but it could be 30 days
 
06:57:46.968 --> 06:57:46.978 align:start position:0%
so a lot of times especially if people
 
06:57:49.670 --> 06:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
don't hire a lawyer right away by the
 
06:57:51.410 --> 06:57:51.420 align:start position:0%
time they even hired me the blood's
 
06:57:53.208 --> 06:57:53.218 align:start position:0%
already been destroyed I think it's just
 
06:57:55.910 --> 06:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
outrageous that the state knowingly is
 
06:57:57.590 --> 06:57:57.600 align:start position:0%
destroying evidence that they know is
 
06:57:58.850 --> 06:57:58.860 align:start position:0%
going to be used in a criminal case
 
06:58:00.830 --> 06:58:00.840 align:start position:0%
while that criminal case is pending they
 
06:58:02.510 --> 06:58:02.520 align:start position:0%
know the case is pending they're it's
 
06:58:04.310 --> 06:58:04.320 align:start position:0%
the state so
 
06:58:06.350 --> 06:58:06.360 align:start position:0%
um I think if they were to do this for
 
06:58:09.230 --> 06:58:09.240 align:start position:0%
DNA there'd be outrage but because it's
 
06:58:09.240 --> 06:58:10.310 align:start position:0%
DNA there'd be outrage but because it's
blood

06:58:10.310 --> 06:58:10.320 align:start position:0%
blood
 
06:58:13.250 --> 06:58:13.260 align:start position:0%
um potentially it's alcohol used in DWI
 
06:58:15.770 --> 06:58:15.780 align:start position:0%
case I guess people care less but at the
 
06:58:17.930 --> 06:58:17.940 align:start position:0%
end of the day people have the right to
 
06:58:21.830 --> 06:58:21.840 align:start position:0%
get that blood tested it sometimes comes
 
06:58:23.570 --> 06:58:23.580 align:start position:0%
back different there could be issues
 
06:58:26.330 --> 06:58:26.340 align:start position:0%
with it and just for basically the state
 
06:58:28.010 --> 06:58:28.020 align:start position:0%
to destroy the blood because in my
 
06:58:30.948 --> 06:58:30.958 align:start position:0%
opinion they can't afford to store it
 
06:58:33.530 --> 06:58:33.540 align:start position:0%
which I can't imagine be very expensive
 
06:58:35.390 --> 06:58:35.400 align:start position:0%
for a couple more refrigerators so this
 
06:58:36.948 --> 06:58:36.958 align:start position:0%
is your marketing money for them for
 
06:58:36.958 --> 06:58:38.270 align:start position:0%
is your marketing money for them for
that

06:58:38.270 --> 06:58:38.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:58:40.850 --> 06:58:40.860 align:start position:0%
um in regards to Discovery rights so New
 
06:58:41.990 --> 06:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is generally pretty good we
 
06:58:43.310 --> 06:58:43.320 align:start position:0%
have what's called an open file
 
06:58:45.230 --> 06:58:45.240 align:start position:0%
Discovery so basically the prosecutor
 
06:58:46.910 --> 06:58:46.920 align:start position:0%
will send you everything they have with
 
06:58:48.770 --> 06:58:48.780 align:start position:0%
the exception of basically work product
 
06:58:50.868 --> 06:58:50.878 align:start position:0%
so if the lawyer has opinions on the
 
06:58:52.310 --> 06:58:52.320 align:start position:0%
case and Josh sat down they might not
 
06:58:53.868 --> 06:58:53.878 align:start position:0%
send me that
 
06:58:55.968 --> 06:58:55.978 align:start position:0%
um or witness I mean that but pretty
 
06:58:58.190 --> 06:58:58.200 align:start position:0%
much everything else we get so this just
 
06:59:01.910 --> 06:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
speeds up that time frame depositions
 
06:59:03.890 --> 06:59:03.900 align:start position:0%
um so depositions in a criminal case is
 
06:59:06.770 --> 06:59:06.780 align:start position:0%
a type of Discovery so basically is like
 
06:59:09.590 --> 06:59:09.600 align:start position:0%
a interview that's being recorded with
 
06:59:11.090 --> 06:59:11.100 align:start position:0%
someone under oath
 
06:59:12.530 --> 06:59:12.540 align:start position:0%
um of a witness because the best mate
 
06:59:15.170 --> 06:59:15.180 align:start position:0%
for me to describe that so I find it
 
06:59:16.250 --> 06:59:16.260 align:start position:0%
interesting that you can get a
 
06:59:18.288 --> 06:59:18.298 align:start position:0%
deposition in this case in this state a
 
06:59:19.610 --> 06:59:19.620 align:start position:0%
lot easier in a civil case than you
 
06:59:21.468 --> 06:59:21.478 align:start position:0%
criminal can in a criminal case I think
 
06:59:23.030 --> 06:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
it's kind of backwards
 
06:59:25.490 --> 06:59:25.500 align:start position:0%
um so I noted that the New Hampshire
 
06:59:27.230 --> 06:59:27.240 align:start position:0%
Association of criminal defense lawyers
 
06:59:30.230 --> 06:59:30.240 align:start position:0%
did submit um a I believe it did get
 
06:59:31.490 --> 06:59:31.500 align:start position:0%
sent to me so I assume we got sent to
 
06:59:33.708 --> 06:59:33.718 align:start position:0%
committee Nile forward to it uh the
 
06:59:35.990 --> 06:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
committee it was an amendment um they
 
06:59:38.270 --> 06:59:38.280 align:start position:0%
had better language for it so I'm just
 
06:59:39.770 --> 06:59:39.780 align:start position:0%
um said it shall take place within 30
 
06:59:42.170 --> 06:59:42.180 align:start position:0%
days but theirs went through uh
 
06:59:43.910 --> 06:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
basically how it would take place and
 
06:59:45.410 --> 06:59:45.420 align:start position:0%
they didn't have a Time requirement I
 
06:59:46.730 --> 06:59:46.740 align:start position:0%
but I certainly would adopt their
 
06:59:48.288 --> 06:59:48.298 align:start position:0%
amendment was a lot more thorough than
 
06:59:50.570 --> 06:59:50.580 align:start position:0%
mine and they referenced putting in
 
06:59:54.048 --> 06:59:54.058 align:start position:0%
chapter 5 17 13 so they also know they
 
06:59:55.490 --> 06:59:55.500 align:start position:0%
didn't really have a preference if it
 
06:59:57.170 --> 06:59:57.180 align:start position:0%
got put in this I also don't care if it
 
06:59:59.510 --> 06:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
got put in that or this but I think
 
07:00:00.890 --> 07:00:00.900 align:start position:0%
people should be entitled to that
 
07:00:02.810 --> 07:00:02.820 align:start position:0%
positions with um the exception they
 
07:00:04.548 --> 07:00:04.558 align:start position:0%
were looking for was miners I don't take
 
07:00:06.410 --> 07:00:06.420 align:start position:0%
any issue with that
 
07:00:06.420 --> 07:00:08.330 align:start position:0%
any issue with that
um

07:00:08.330 --> 07:00:08.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:00:11.208 --> 07:00:11.218 align:start position:0%
police honesty um I just believe peace
 
07:00:12.890 --> 07:00:12.900 align:start position:0%
police should be honest with people when
 
07:00:14.448 --> 07:00:14.458 align:start position:0%
they're interrogating people
 
07:00:16.368 --> 07:00:16.378 align:start position:0%
um I think that's one of the main causes
 
07:00:19.910 --> 07:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
of false confessions is lying to people
 
07:00:21.708 --> 07:00:21.718 align:start position:0%
um write to Media I just believe that
 
07:00:23.208 --> 07:00:23.218 align:start position:0%
people should have a right to
 
07:00:23.218 --> 07:00:24.650 align:start position:0%
people should have a right to
essentially

07:00:24.650 --> 07:00:24.660 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
07:00:26.330 --> 07:00:26.340 align:start position:0%
tell the media their side of the case
 
07:00:28.310 --> 07:00:28.320 align:start position:0%
ahead of time
 
07:00:31.788 --> 07:00:31.798 align:start position:0%
um presenting exculpatory evidence uh to
 
07:00:34.010 --> 07:00:34.020 align:start position:0%
the grand jury I think if prosecutor
 
07:00:35.750 --> 07:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
knows that there's evidence that shows
 
07:00:37.250 --> 07:00:37.260 align:start position:0%
that someone did not commit a crime they
 
07:00:38.390 --> 07:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
should be presenting that to a grand
 
07:00:40.430 --> 07:00:40.440 align:start position:0%
jury and then the penalty assessment
 
07:00:42.830 --> 07:00:42.840 align:start position:0%
like I said basically would increase the
 
07:00:45.350 --> 07:00:45.360 align:start position:0%
final cases with the premise that it's
 
07:00:47.570 --> 07:00:47.580 align:start position:0%
going to hire more judges and then money
 
07:00:50.270 --> 07:00:50.280 align:start position:0%
earmarked related to alcohol cases with
 
07:00:53.330 --> 07:00:53.340 align:start position:0%
the premise that the lab will then have
 
07:00:55.610 --> 07:00:55.620 align:start position:0%
money to store evidence and actually
 
07:00:58.548 --> 07:00:58.558 align:start position:0%
hire more analysts so that things get
 
07:01:02.090 --> 07:01:02.100 align:start position:0%
analyzed in a quick ER fashion so it's a
 
07:01:03.288 --> 07:01:03.298 align:start position:0%
rough summary of everything I know
 
07:01:05.150 --> 07:01:05.160 align:start position:0%
there's a ton of stuff in here and
 
07:01:07.368 --> 07:01:07.378 align:start position:0%
frankly if some of it got adopted some
 
07:01:09.708 --> 07:01:09.718 align:start position:0%
is better than nothing so I would be
 
07:01:11.390 --> 07:01:11.400 align:start position:0%
pretty supportive of pretty much any
 
07:01:13.910 --> 07:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
Amendment keeping any of this and I'm
 
07:01:20.230 --> 07:01:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:32.410 --> 07:01:32.420 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:35.628 --> 07:01:35.638 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes uh attorney Andress
 
07:01:40.690 --> 07:01:40.700 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:43.788 --> 07:01:43.798 align:start position:0%
saves time
 
07:01:45.230 --> 07:01:45.240 align:start position:0%
again my name is Jeff Sullivan
 
07:01:46.430 --> 07:01:46.440 align:start position:0%
associated general from New Hampshire
 
07:01:48.590 --> 07:01:48.600 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office this is Steve
 
07:01:50.810 --> 07:01:50.820 align:start position:0%
Anderson County Attorney's Office we
 
07:01:52.910 --> 07:01:52.920 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill and I'll explain why so
 
07:01:54.170 --> 07:01:54.180 align:start position:0%
I'm going to talk in general terms and
 
07:01:55.128 --> 07:01:55.138 align:start position:0%
then we're happy to answer your
 
07:01:55.138 --> 07:01:56.390 align:start position:0%
then we're happy to answer your
questions

07:01:56.390 --> 07:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
questions
 
07:01:59.270 --> 07:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
sorry no you had it we just can't hear
 
07:02:01.968 --> 07:02:01.978 align:start position:0%
you closer to you thank you you're
 
07:02:04.430 --> 07:02:04.440 align:start position:0%
welcome uh so the bill is not necessary
 
07:02:06.288 --> 07:02:06.298 align:start position:0%
and it's impractical those are the two
 
07:02:08.150 --> 07:02:08.160 align:start position:0%
broad objections that we have pretty
 
07:02:10.128 --> 07:02:10.138 align:start position:0%
much every aspect of this bill is
 
07:02:11.690 --> 07:02:11.700 align:start position:0%
already covered by existing New
 
07:02:13.910 --> 07:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law or court rules that
 
07:02:15.708 --> 07:02:15.718 align:start position:0%
includes the issue of trial deadlines
 
07:02:18.230 --> 07:02:18.240 align:start position:0%
speedy trial the discovery rights
 
07:02:20.330 --> 07:02:20.340 align:start position:0%
depositions preservation of evidence and
 
07:02:22.850 --> 07:02:22.860 align:start position:0%
grand jury proceedings those things are
 
07:02:25.190 --> 07:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
covered in existing well-established New
 
07:02:27.468 --> 07:02:27.478 align:start position:0%
Hampshire case law there's no need to
 
07:02:29.510 --> 07:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
create laws that already duplicate those
 
07:02:31.548 --> 07:02:31.558 align:start position:0%
and change them actually for the worse
 
07:02:33.650 --> 07:02:33.660 align:start position:0%
because the standards this bill imposes
 
07:02:36.590 --> 07:02:36.600 align:start position:0%
are quite frankly impractical given our
 
07:02:38.868 --> 07:02:38.878 align:start position:0%
current system the deadlines in this
 
07:02:40.548 --> 07:02:40.558 align:start position:0%
case could never be met with the number
 
07:02:42.350 --> 07:02:42.360 align:start position:0%
of current lawyers we have our current
 
07:02:44.690 --> 07:02:44.700 align:start position:0%
Staffing in the court you would have to
 
07:02:47.030 --> 07:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
spend tens of millions of dollars to be
 
07:02:49.070 --> 07:02:49.080 align:start position:0%
able to meet these deadlines it's simply
 
07:02:51.708 --> 07:02:51.718 align:start position:0%
impossible given the amount of cases
 
07:02:53.930 --> 07:02:53.940 align:start position:0%
that people currently have you have
 
07:02:56.690 --> 07:02:56.700 align:start position:0%
prosecutors that have 150 to 200 cases
 
07:02:58.730 --> 07:02:58.740 align:start position:0%
defense attorneys that have 80 to 100
 
07:03:01.070 --> 07:03:01.080 align:start position:0%
cases in order to meet these deadlines
 
07:03:03.590 --> 07:03:03.600 align:start position:0%
you would have to Triple quadruple the
 
07:03:05.270 --> 07:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
number of those people and then have the
 
07:03:08.090 --> 07:03:08.100 align:start position:0%
consummate same increase in core
 
07:03:10.250 --> 07:03:10.260 align:start position:0%
Personnel that's simply not possible and
 
07:03:12.530 --> 07:03:12.540 align:start position:0%
quite frankly it's not necessary most
 
07:03:14.270 --> 07:03:14.280 align:start position:0%
every lawyer you talk to who does a
 
07:03:15.830 --> 07:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
complicated criminal case will tell you
 
07:03:19.190 --> 07:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
they want more time not less time that
 
07:03:21.110 --> 07:03:21.120 align:start position:0%
murder case that was referenced is my
 
07:03:22.250 --> 07:03:22.260 align:start position:0%
murder case
 
07:03:24.350 --> 07:03:24.360 align:start position:0%
and it took three years to get the trial
 
07:03:26.270 --> 07:03:26.280 align:start position:0%
because of covid and because the
 
07:03:27.890 --> 07:03:27.900 align:start position:0%
defendant raised mental health issues
 
07:03:30.170 --> 07:03:30.180 align:start position:0%
and insanity and those issues are
 
07:03:32.090 --> 07:03:32.100 align:start position:0%
complicated and require multiple experts
 
07:03:34.490 --> 07:03:34.500 align:start position:0%
and we did depositions and all those
 
07:03:37.250 --> 07:03:37.260 align:start position:0%
things and that takes time so we wanted
 
07:03:38.930 --> 07:03:38.940 align:start position:0%
to go to trial as quickly as possible
 
07:03:40.730 --> 07:03:40.740 align:start position:0%
and the defense wanted more time and
 
07:03:42.650 --> 07:03:42.660 align:start position:0%
that's typically how speedy trial works
 
07:03:44.448 --> 07:03:44.458 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's the opposite but the
 
07:03:46.430 --> 07:03:46.440 align:start position:0%
court balances those factors and in the
 
07:03:48.468 --> 07:03:48.478 align:start position:0%
end the defendant has a right to
 
07:03:51.288 --> 07:03:51.298 align:start position:0%
effective assistance of counsel and
 
07:03:53.330 --> 07:03:53.340 align:start position:0%
unless an attorney only has one client
 
07:03:55.070 --> 07:03:55.080 align:start position:0%
in one case they've got to balance the
 
07:03:56.448 --> 07:03:56.458 align:start position:0%
needs of their other clients in other
 
07:03:58.250 --> 07:03:58.260 align:start position:0%
cases and they want to take the time
 
07:04:00.468 --> 07:04:00.478 align:start position:0%
that's necessary to do the best job for
 
07:04:02.090 --> 07:04:02.100 align:start position:0%
their client and that's why we don't
 
07:04:03.708 --> 07:04:03.718 align:start position:0%
have a speedy trial issue in New
 
07:04:03.718 --> 07:04:04.910 align:start position:0%
have a speedy trial issue in New
Hampshire

07:04:04.910 --> 07:04:04.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
07:04:04.920 --> 07:04:07.190 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
um

07:04:07.190 --> 07:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:04:09.650 --> 07:04:09.660 align:start position:0%
the bill talks about deadlines it talks
 
07:04:11.390 --> 07:04:11.400 align:start position:0%
about depositions talk about deposition
 
07:04:13.310 --> 07:04:13.320 align:start position:0%
for a second a deposition is a
 
07:04:15.590 --> 07:04:15.600 align:start position:0%
proceeding where both sides both sets of
 
07:04:17.810 --> 07:04:17.820 align:start position:0%
lawyers get together in a room and a
 
07:04:19.310 --> 07:04:19.320 align:start position:0%
witness is put under oath and that
 
07:04:21.890 --> 07:04:21.900 align:start position:0%
witness's question it's recorded and
 
07:04:24.590 --> 07:04:24.600 align:start position:0%
then transcribed it takes time to get
 
07:04:25.910 --> 07:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
everybody in the same room and schedule
 
07:04:28.548 --> 07:04:28.558 align:start position:0%
it it takes money to pay for that person
 
07:04:30.288 --> 07:04:30.298 align:start position:0%
to record it and money to get it
 
07:04:32.810 --> 07:04:32.820 align:start position:0%
transcribed you will spend tens of
 
07:04:34.788 --> 07:04:34.798 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars if you give a
 
07:04:36.170 --> 07:04:36.180 align:start position:0%
defendant the right to depose every
 
07:04:38.448 --> 07:04:38.458 align:start position:0%
witness in every case It's Not Unusual
 
07:04:40.190 --> 07:04:40.200 align:start position:0%
in one of my homicide cases to have a
 
07:04:42.890 --> 07:04:42.900 align:start position:0%
potential 50 or 60 Witnesses if a
 
07:04:44.570 --> 07:04:44.580 align:start position:0%
defendant has a right to depose each and
 
07:04:46.010 --> 07:04:46.020 align:start position:0%
every one of those people the lawyers
 
07:04:47.628 --> 07:04:47.638 align:start position:0%
will spend the next three to four months
 
07:04:50.208 --> 07:04:50.218 align:start position:0%
just doing depositions and we'll blow
 
07:04:52.490 --> 07:04:52.500 align:start position:0%
those speedy trial deadlines so it's
 
07:04:54.530 --> 07:04:54.540 align:start position:0%
completely impractical to say to a
 
07:04:56.270 --> 07:04:56.280 align:start position:0%
defendant you have the right to depose
 
07:04:58.490 --> 07:04:58.500 align:start position:0%
every single witness but at the same
 
07:04:59.810 --> 07:04:59.820 align:start position:0%
time we're going to set these deadlines
 
07:05:01.670 --> 07:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
for Speedy Trial you can't have one or
 
07:05:02.510 --> 07:05:02.520 align:start position:0%
the other
 
07:05:04.788 --> 07:05:04.798 align:start position:0%
the way the law works now is every
 
07:05:07.070 --> 07:05:07.080 align:start position:0%
defendant every every party in a
 
07:05:08.868 --> 07:05:08.878 align:start position:0%
criminal case has an absolute right to
 
07:05:12.288 --> 07:05:12.298 align:start position:0%
depose any expert witness case so if I
 
07:05:14.090 --> 07:05:14.100 align:start position:0%
call an expert if the defense does they
 
07:05:15.770 --> 07:05:15.780 align:start position:0%
have the absolute right to depose that
 
07:05:18.048 --> 07:05:18.058 align:start position:0%
witness every other witness is that the
 
07:05:20.090 --> 07:05:20.100 align:start position:0%
judge's discretion and the reason it's
 
07:05:21.590 --> 07:05:21.600 align:start position:0%
different from civil cases where you
 
07:05:23.930 --> 07:05:23.940 align:start position:0%
have more depositions is in a civil case
 
07:05:25.610 --> 07:05:25.620 align:start position:0%
you don't have one side that's
 
07:05:27.170 --> 07:05:27.180 align:start position:0%
generating all the evidence in a
 
07:05:29.090 --> 07:05:29.100 align:start position:0%
criminal case we the state generate all
 
07:05:30.590 --> 07:05:30.600 align:start position:0%
the evidence and we have to give it all
 
07:05:32.930 --> 07:05:32.940 align:start position:0%
to the other side so there's far less of
 
07:05:34.670 --> 07:05:34.680 align:start position:0%
a need to have depositions because we're
 
07:05:37.310 --> 07:05:37.320 align:start position:0%
doing the interviews whether audio video
 
07:05:39.530 --> 07:05:39.540 align:start position:0%
recorded we're we're creating the
 
07:05:41.090 --> 07:05:41.100 align:start position:0%
evidence and handing it over to the
 
07:05:42.650 --> 07:05:42.660 align:start position:0%
other side so there isn't the same need
 
07:05:44.448 --> 07:05:44.458 align:start position:0%
for depositions like in a civil case
 
07:05:46.730 --> 07:05:46.740 align:start position:0%
we're often there's just nothing there
 
07:05:48.890 --> 07:05:48.900 align:start position:0%
to begin with so that's why the two are
 
07:05:50.570 --> 07:05:50.580 align:start position:0%
very very different and many states
 
07:05:52.548 --> 07:05:52.558 align:start position:0%
across the country criminal defendants
 
07:05:54.650 --> 07:05:54.660 align:start position:0%
have no right to a deposition at all so
 
07:05:56.208 --> 07:05:56.218 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is actually ahead of the
 
07:05:58.128 --> 07:05:58.138 align:start position:0%
curve on that but again if you're going
 
07:05:59.510 --> 07:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
to give a defendant the right to depose
 
07:06:01.250 --> 07:06:01.260 align:start position:0%
every single witness in every single
 
07:06:03.410 --> 07:06:03.420 align:start position:0%
case he will clog the system down
 
07:06:05.570 --> 07:06:05.580 align:start position:0%
because it will take me months to get
 
07:06:07.730 --> 07:06:07.740 align:start position:0%
those depositions done before we can
 
07:06:09.110 --> 07:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
even do the other things to prepare for
 
07:06:11.628 --> 07:06:11.638 align:start position:0%
trial so have the actual opposite effect
 
07:06:13.670 --> 07:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
of speeding things up it will actually
 
07:06:14.990 --> 07:06:15.000 align:start position:0%
slow it down
 
07:06:16.968 --> 07:06:16.978 align:start position:0%
I won't go through every single thing in
 
07:06:18.468 --> 07:06:18.478 align:start position:0%
the bill Steve's going to cover some of
 
07:06:19.548 --> 07:06:19.558 align:start position:0%
the other stuff but I want to talk about
 
07:06:21.770 --> 07:06:21.780 align:start position:0%
the the honesty piece
 
07:06:23.690 --> 07:06:23.700 align:start position:0%
it'd be great if everybody told the
 
07:06:24.890 --> 07:06:24.900 align:start position:0%
truth but the reason that we're doing
 
07:06:26.208 --> 07:06:26.218 align:start position:0%
criminal investigations is because
 
07:06:27.830 --> 07:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
typically people aren't telling us the
 
07:06:27.840 --> 07:06:28.610 align:start position:0%
typically people aren't telling us the
truth

07:06:28.610 --> 07:06:28.620 align:start position:0%
truth
 
07:06:30.708 --> 07:06:30.718 align:start position:0%
police officers who are undercover and
 
07:06:33.468 --> 07:06:33.478 align:start position:0%
doing sting operations can't be required
 
07:06:34.910 --> 07:06:34.920 align:start position:0%
to tell the truth otherwise they're not
 
07:06:36.170 --> 07:06:36.180 align:start position:0%
going to be able to catch these folks
 
07:06:38.208 --> 07:06:38.218 align:start position:0%
every undercover officer has to
 
07:06:41.690 --> 07:06:41.700 align:start position:0%
masquerade as a customer or a drug
 
07:06:43.610 --> 07:06:43.620 align:start position:0%
dealer we do sting operations where
 
07:06:45.230 --> 07:06:45.240 align:start position:0%
somebody may tell us hey
 
07:06:47.690 --> 07:06:47.700 align:start position:0%
this doctor is doing something wrong we
 
07:06:48.830 --> 07:06:48.840 align:start position:0%
need to put somebody in to fake
 
07:06:50.628 --> 07:06:50.638 align:start position:0%
themselves as a patient this would
 
07:06:52.490 --> 07:06:52.500 align:start position:0%
preclude us from doing those basic
 
07:06:54.770 --> 07:06:54.780 align:start position:0%
things in criminal investigation you
 
07:06:56.030 --> 07:06:56.040 align:start position:0%
know typically if we go and announce
 
07:06:57.948 --> 07:06:57.958 align:start position:0%
exactly who we are and why we're there
 
07:07:00.048 --> 07:07:00.058 align:start position:0%
you know to a perpetrator they're not
 
07:07:01.730 --> 07:07:01.740 align:start position:0%
just going to tell us what's going on so
 
07:07:03.890 --> 07:07:03.900 align:start position:0%
sometimes we do have to use deception we
 
07:07:05.868 --> 07:07:05.878 align:start position:0%
do have to lie we do have to Bluff
 
07:07:07.670 --> 07:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
that's what we have to do that's and
 
07:07:09.288 --> 07:07:09.298 align:start position:0%
that's one of the tools that the law
 
07:07:10.730 --> 07:07:10.740 align:start position:0%
allows us to do
 
07:07:12.948 --> 07:07:12.958 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court has set limits on that
 
07:07:15.230 --> 07:07:15.240 align:start position:0%
if police officers go too far in their
 
07:07:16.730 --> 07:07:16.740 align:start position:0%
deception it can be a due process
 
07:07:19.250 --> 07:07:19.260 align:start position:0%
violation and evidence can be suppressed
 
07:07:20.810 --> 07:07:20.820 align:start position:0%
and charges can be dismissed so I don't
 
07:07:21.650 --> 07:07:21.660 align:start position:0%
want you to think there aren't
 
07:07:23.708 --> 07:07:23.718 align:start position:0%
guidelines out there or
 
07:07:27.230 --> 07:07:27.240 align:start position:0%
guardrails there are but to say that you
 
07:07:29.270 --> 07:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
know officers can't do that you will
 
07:07:31.070 --> 07:07:31.080 align:start position:0%
undercut our ability to go after you
 
07:07:32.628 --> 07:07:32.638 align:start position:0%
know the very people that you all want
 
07:07:34.670 --> 07:07:34.680 align:start position:0%
us to go after out there so it's a tool
 
07:07:37.968 --> 07:07:37.978 align:start position:0%
in the toolbox if it's abused there are
 
07:07:39.948 --> 07:07:39.958 align:start position:0%
repercussions but we don't see that kind
 
07:07:41.990 --> 07:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
of abuse here so this is generally I
 
07:07:43.250 --> 07:07:43.260 align:start position:0%
just want to give you an idea those are
 
07:07:45.288 --> 07:07:45.298 align:start position:0%
some of the general objections that we
 
07:07:47.270 --> 07:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
have Steve will give you a few other
 
07:07:49.610 --> 07:07:49.620 align:start position:0%
particular things and again happy to
 
07:07:50.930 --> 07:07:50.940 align:start position:0%
answer any questions that you have about
 
07:07:50.940 --> 07:07:51.830 align:start position:0%
answer any questions that you have about
this

07:07:51.830 --> 07:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
this
 
07:07:54.708 --> 07:07:54.718 align:start position:0%
thank you we referenced the speedy trial
 
07:07:56.510 --> 07:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
I hear people talking about a murder
 
07:07:58.850 --> 07:07:58.860 align:start position:0%
case that went on for three years It
 
07:08:01.070 --> 07:08:01.080 align:start position:0%
just strikes me that
 
07:08:04.368 --> 07:08:04.378 align:start position:0%
it would be unfathomable to me that a
 
07:08:06.288 --> 07:08:06.298 align:start position:0%
murder case would be dismissed simply
 
07:08:08.690 --> 07:08:08.700 align:start position:0%
because it wasn't tried fast enough
 
07:08:13.150 --> 07:08:13.160 align:start position:0%
in this sets that deadline at
 
07:08:15.770 --> 07:08:15.780 align:start position:0%
180 days from the arrest
 
07:08:19.548 --> 07:08:19.558 align:start position:0%
which is a remarkably fast deadline and
 
07:08:20.930 --> 07:08:20.940 align:start position:0%
as attorney strolls and said there's
 
07:08:23.628 --> 07:08:23.638 align:start position:0%
already constitutional parameters for
 
07:08:26.150 --> 07:08:26.160 align:start position:0%
Speedy Trial the superior court has a
 
07:08:28.610 --> 07:08:28.620 align:start position:0%
speedy trial policy already
 
07:08:31.070 --> 07:08:31.080 align:start position:0%
uh and dismissal is just such an extreme
 
07:08:33.410 --> 07:08:33.420 align:start position:0%
sanction and cause in this case isn't
 
07:08:36.288 --> 07:08:36.298 align:start position:0%
defined so it strikes me that a witness
 
07:08:38.810 --> 07:08:38.820 align:start position:0%
not being available would certainly be
 
07:08:41.628 --> 07:08:41.638 align:start position:0%
good cause to continue a case or or
 
07:08:44.390 --> 07:08:44.400 align:start position:0%
exceed those timelines with reference to
 
07:08:46.368 --> 07:08:46.378 align:start position:0%
Discovery it talks about Discovery
 
07:08:49.150 --> 07:08:49.160 align:start position:0%
within 30 days of the date of arrest
 
07:08:51.110 --> 07:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
judicial proceedings in New Hampshire
 
07:08:52.910 --> 07:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
aren't commenced by an arrest they're
 
07:08:54.590 --> 07:08:54.600 align:start position:0%
commenced by the filing of a complaint
 
07:08:57.048 --> 07:08:57.058 align:start position:0%
in court there's ways that that can
 
07:08:58.910 --> 07:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
occur without an arrest for example you
 
07:09:00.468 --> 07:09:00.478 align:start position:0%
could be summonsed in lieu of an arrest
 
07:09:02.990 --> 07:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
or you could be directly indicted with
 
07:09:05.628 --> 07:09:05.638 align:start position:0%
no arrest so it doesn't make any sense
 
07:09:09.170 --> 07:09:09.180 align:start position:0%
to to have the the starting date be the
 
07:09:10.910 --> 07:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
arrest since that's not the beginning of
 
07:09:13.610 --> 07:09:13.620 align:start position:0%
the criminal proceedings
 
07:09:15.590 --> 07:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
the last sentence of that same section
 
07:09:18.110 --> 07:09:18.120 align:start position:0%
in Discovery says the defendant shall be
 
07:09:19.548 --> 07:09:19.558 align:start position:0%
entitled to a copy of their criminal
 
07:09:21.830 --> 07:09:21.840 align:start position:0%
record prior to a bail hearing if the
 
07:09:23.510 --> 07:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
state uses the criminal record at the
 
07:09:26.330 --> 07:09:26.340 align:start position:0%
bail hearing that's a concept that was
 
07:09:27.650 --> 07:09:27.660 align:start position:0%
sort of batted around by the New
 
07:09:29.390 --> 07:09:29.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court in an amendment
 
07:09:32.468 --> 07:09:32.478 align:start position:0%
to rule 12 last year and the year before
 
07:09:36.288 --> 07:09:36.298 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court has a rules an
 
07:09:38.330 --> 07:09:38.340 align:start position:0%
advisory committee on the rules
 
07:09:40.990 --> 07:09:41.000 align:start position:0%
under docket
 
07:09:44.510 --> 07:09:44.520 align:start position:0%
2020-006 they considered that proposal
 
07:09:46.910 --> 07:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
there were a number of letters written
 
07:09:48.530 --> 07:09:48.540 align:start position:0%
to the advisory committee on the rules
 
07:09:49.968 --> 07:09:49.978 align:start position:0%
there was a public hearing there was a
 
07:09:51.830 --> 07:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
subcommittee formed I know that the
 
07:09:53.570 --> 07:09:53.580 align:start position:0%
subcommittee met several times they were
 
07:09:55.250 --> 07:09:55.260 align:start position:0%
unable to come up with a consensus the
 
07:09:57.230 --> 07:09:57.240 align:start position:0%
subcommittee actually
 
07:09:57.240 --> 07:09:58.010 align:start position:0%
subcommittee actually
um

07:09:58.010 --> 07:09:58.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:10:00.650 --> 07:10:00.660 align:start position:0%
wrote three separate reports since they
 
07:10:02.830 --> 07:10:02.840 align:start position:0%
weren't able to come up to a consensus
 
07:10:05.208 --> 07:10:05.218 align:start position:0%
that then went before the entire Supreme
 
07:10:08.410 --> 07:10:08.420 align:start position:0%
 
07:10:11.030 --> 07:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
r-2022-0003 the Supreme Court also
 
07:10:12.468 --> 07:10:12.478 align:start position:0%
sought public input there was public
 
07:10:15.410 --> 07:10:15.420 align:start position:0%
input uh given in the Supreme Court and
 
07:10:16.968 --> 07:10:16.978 align:start position:0%
after all that public input the Supreme
 
07:10:18.890 --> 07:10:18.900 align:start position:0%
Court essentially found that that would
 
07:10:21.770 --> 07:10:21.780 align:start position:0%
be an unworkable addition to the the
 
07:10:21.780 --> 07:10:22.910 align:start position:0%
be an unworkable addition to the the
rules

07:10:22.910 --> 07:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
rules
 
07:10:26.628 --> 07:10:26.638 align:start position:0%
and uh did not pass that with reference
 
07:10:29.030 --> 07:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
to depositions as has been already said
 
07:10:30.410 --> 07:10:30.420 align:start position:0%
a number of times there's already a
 
07:10:31.670 --> 07:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
statute in New Hampshire that covers
 
07:10:34.070 --> 07:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
depositions in criminal cases one of the
 
07:10:35.208 --> 07:10:35.218 align:start position:0%
things that strikes me about the
 
07:10:35.218 --> 07:10:36.468 align:start position:0%
things that strikes me about the
deposition

07:10:36.468 --> 07:10:36.478 align:start position:0%
deposition
 
07:10:39.590 --> 07:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
this proposed bill is that it provides
 
07:10:41.030 --> 07:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
the defendant with a greater entitlement
 
07:10:43.010 --> 07:10:43.020 align:start position:0%
to a deposition than the state and I
 
07:10:45.530 --> 07:10:45.540 align:start position:0%
don't understand why that would be uh
 
07:10:49.430 --> 07:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
the current statute 517 13 entitles both
 
07:10:51.890 --> 07:10:51.900 align:start position:0%
parties to depositions equally with
 
07:10:53.270 --> 07:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
reference to the preservation of
 
07:10:54.530 --> 07:10:54.540 align:start position:0%
evidence uh there's already
 
07:10:56.150 --> 07:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
constitutional principles about the
 
07:10:59.090 --> 07:10:59.100 align:start position:0%
preservation of evidence and again the
 
07:11:01.190 --> 07:11:01.200 align:start position:0%
the remedy here is dismissal which
 
07:11:02.810 --> 07:11:02.820 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense because the Lost
 
07:11:05.628 --> 07:11:05.638 align:start position:0%
evidence may be somewhat unrelated to
 
07:11:07.390 --> 07:11:07.400 align:start position:0%
the actual crime itself
 
07:11:09.830 --> 07:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
just for example if someone was arrested
 
07:11:11.448 --> 07:11:11.458 align:start position:0%
for domestic violence and they were
 
07:11:13.010 --> 07:11:13.020 align:start position:0%
brought back to the police station and
 
07:11:13.020 --> 07:11:14.150 align:start position:0%
brought back to the police station and
booked

07:11:14.150 --> 07:11:14.160 align:start position:0%
booked
 
07:11:16.010 --> 07:11:16.020 align:start position:0%
the booking may have been completely
 
07:11:18.110 --> 07:11:18.120 align:start position:0%
routine and yielded no evidence but if
 
07:11:20.810 --> 07:11:20.820 align:start position:0%
the booking video itself was lost this
 
07:11:22.548 --> 07:11:22.558 align:start position:0%
statute would require
 
07:11:22.558 --> 07:11:23.270 align:start position:0%
statute would require
um

07:11:23.270 --> 07:11:23.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:11:25.670 --> 07:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
would require dismissal and if not
 
07:11:27.468 --> 07:11:27.478 align:start position:0%
dismissal then the fact finder could
 
07:11:29.090 --> 07:11:29.100 align:start position:0%
make a negative inference against the
 
07:11:32.330 --> 07:11:32.340 align:start position:0%
state related to that booking video with
 
07:11:34.670 --> 07:11:34.680 align:start position:0%
reference to the DWI statute
 
07:11:37.190 --> 07:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
Council or the defendant is notified of
 
07:11:39.530 --> 07:11:39.540 align:start position:0%
their blood results I Believe by within
 
07:11:42.288 --> 07:11:42.298 align:start position:0%
10 days and then they have 30 days to
 
07:11:44.170 --> 07:11:44.180 align:start position:0%
pick up their second sample at the lab
 
07:11:47.090 --> 07:11:47.100 align:start position:0%
so it's not that it's being destroyed
 
07:11:49.190 --> 07:11:49.200 align:start position:0%
they're being notified you have a time
 
07:11:51.708 --> 07:11:51.718 align:start position:0%
frame to pick it up and
 
07:11:53.810 --> 07:11:53.820 align:start position:0%
uh attorney strolls uncovered the police
 
07:11:55.850 --> 07:11:55.860 align:start position:0%
honesty again there's case law on that
 
07:11:58.910 --> 07:11:58.920 align:start position:0%
the question's not the question about it
 
07:12:00.530 --> 07:12:00.540 align:start position:0%
is whether a statement is knowingly
 
07:12:03.230 --> 07:12:03.240 align:start position:0%
intelligently and voluntarily given the
 
07:12:04.910 --> 07:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
question is not whether or not the
 
07:12:05.990 --> 07:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
person was
 
07:12:08.750 --> 07:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
maybe lied to prior to them giving that
 
07:12:08.760 --> 07:12:10.010 align:start position:0%
maybe lied to prior to them giving that
statement

07:12:10.010 --> 07:12:10.020 align:start position:0%
statement
 
07:12:13.010 --> 07:12:13.020 align:start position:0%
it's whether it's knowingly voluntarily
 
07:12:13.020 --> 07:12:14.628 align:start position:0%
it's whether it's knowingly voluntarily
given

07:12:14.628 --> 07:12:14.638 align:start position:0%
given
 
07:12:16.730 --> 07:12:16.740 align:start position:0%
in terms of right to the media
 
07:12:18.770 --> 07:12:18.780 align:start position:0%
attorneys are bound by the New Hampshire
 
07:12:21.170 --> 07:12:21.180 align:start position:0%
rules of professional responsibility and
 
07:12:23.448 --> 07:12:23.458 align:start position:0%
Rule 3.6 limit to lawyers ability to
 
07:12:26.208 --> 07:12:26.218 align:start position:0%
make public statements prior to uh
 
07:12:29.270 --> 07:12:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:12:31.490 --> 07:12:31.500 align:start position:0%
and to some extent defendants already
 
07:12:33.708 --> 07:12:33.718 align:start position:0%
possess a right to to speak to the media
 
07:12:36.410 --> 07:12:36.420 align:start position:0%
I'm not aware of any law or limitation
 
07:12:38.208 --> 07:12:38.218 align:start position:0%
that says if you're charged for the
 
07:12:40.190 --> 07:12:40.200 align:start position:0%
crime you can't talk to the Press
 
07:12:42.590 --> 07:12:42.600 align:start position:0%
if you're represented by Council I would
 
07:12:44.090 --> 07:12:44.100 align:start position:0%
assume that any intelligent criminal
 
07:12:45.948 --> 07:12:45.958 align:start position:0%
defense attorney would tell you
 
07:12:48.590 --> 07:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
don't talk to anybody especially don't
 
07:12:50.810 --> 07:12:50.820 align:start position:0%
talk to the Press because if you talk to
 
07:12:52.250 --> 07:12:52.260 align:start position:0%
the Press it's going to get published
 
07:12:54.170 --> 07:12:54.180 align:start position:0%
and then the prosecutor is going to see
 
07:12:55.968 --> 07:12:55.978 align:start position:0%
that and the judge is going to see it
 
07:12:58.368 --> 07:12:58.378 align:start position:0%
and ultimately may be used against you
 
07:13:01.070 --> 07:13:01.080 align:start position:0%
this this statute the right to me it
 
07:13:02.868 --> 07:13:02.878 align:start position:0%
doesn't actually Grant you a right to
 
07:13:04.250 --> 07:13:04.260 align:start position:0%
speak to the Press what it does is
 
07:13:07.070 --> 07:13:07.080 align:start position:0%
limits the judge's ability to issue
 
07:13:10.010 --> 07:13:10.020 align:start position:0%
appropriate gag orders or to issue
 
07:13:12.468 --> 07:13:12.478 align:start position:0%
appropriate limiting orders
 
07:13:16.310 --> 07:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
um to ensure a fair trial
 
07:13:17.930 --> 07:13:17.940 align:start position:0%
with reference to the exculpatory
 
07:13:19.368 --> 07:13:19.378 align:start position:0%
evidence being provided to the grand
 
07:13:20.690 --> 07:13:20.700 align:start position:0%
jury that
 
07:13:22.910 --> 07:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
the United States Supreme Court actually
 
07:13:25.250 --> 07:13:25.260 align:start position:0%
talked about this in the United States
 
07:13:27.170 --> 07:13:27.180 align:start position:0%
versus Williams which you can find at
 
07:13:31.788 --> 07:13:31.798 align:start position:0%
504 U.S 36 it's a 1992 case it's
 
07:13:33.350 --> 07:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
actually sort of an interesting read
 
07:13:35.390 --> 07:13:35.400 align:start position:0%
they point out that the grand jury is an
 
07:13:37.610 --> 07:13:37.620 align:start position:0%
accusatory body not an adjudicatory one
 
07:13:40.430 --> 07:13:40.440 align:start position:0%
so the grand jury is not deciding
 
07:13:42.350 --> 07:13:42.360 align:start position:0%
whether or not the person is guilty or
 
07:13:45.170 --> 07:13:45.180 align:start position:0%
not guilty the grand jury is assessing
 
07:13:48.230 --> 07:13:48.240 align:start position:0%
whether or not there's enough an
 
07:13:50.090 --> 07:13:50.100 align:start position:0%
adequate basis for bringing criminal
 
07:13:52.368 --> 07:13:52.378 align:start position:0%
charges uh
 
07:13:54.650 --> 07:13:54.660 align:start position:0%
in United States versus Williams it
 
07:13:56.090 --> 07:13:56.100 align:start position:0%
talks about if you wanted a more
 
07:13:57.770 --> 07:13:57.780 align:start position:0%
balanced approach instead of requiring
 
07:13:59.448 --> 07:13:59.458 align:start position:0%
the prosecutor to present exculpatory
 
07:14:02.390 --> 07:14:02.400 align:start position:0%
evidence which may not make any sense it
 
07:14:03.650 --> 07:14:03.660 align:start position:0%
would make more sense to allow the
 
07:14:05.208 --> 07:14:05.218 align:start position:0%
target of the investigation to come in
 
07:14:07.250 --> 07:14:07.260 align:start position:0%
and present their side of the story
 
07:14:09.530 --> 07:14:09.540 align:start position:0%
but that's been consistently rejected
 
07:14:12.288 --> 07:14:12.298 align:start position:0%
because again a grand jury is not it's
 
07:14:16.010 --> 07:14:16.020 align:start position:0%
not an adjudicatory body
 
07:14:19.368 --> 07:14:19.378 align:start position:0%
with reference to the Penalty assessment
 
07:14:21.468 --> 07:14:21.478 align:start position:0%
um in New Hampshire
 
07:14:23.810 --> 07:14:23.820 align:start position:0%
there's a case it's State versus moral
 
07:14:26.810 --> 07:14:26.820 align:start position:0%
you can find it at 123 New Hampshire 707
 
07:14:29.270 --> 07:14:29.280 align:start position:0%
it's actually a 1983 case and they talk
 
07:14:30.890 --> 07:14:30.900 align:start position:0%
about when someone's entitled to a jury
 
07:14:32.448 --> 07:14:32.458 align:start position:0%
trial in New Hampshire
 
07:14:34.368 --> 07:14:34.378 align:start position:0%
and the United the New Hampshire Supreme
 
07:14:36.350 --> 07:14:36.360 align:start position:0%
Court says that
 
07:14:39.350 --> 07:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
if an individual criminal defendant
 
07:14:41.448 --> 07:14:41.458 align:start position:0%
essentially should be entitled to a jury
 
07:14:41.458 --> 07:14:42.410 align:start position:0%
essentially should be entitled to a jury
trial

07:14:42.410 --> 07:14:42.420 align:start position:0%
trial
 
07:14:44.750 --> 07:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
when fines may be levied which are
 
07:14:46.490 --> 07:14:46.500 align:start position:0%
greater than the amount constitutionally
 
07:14:49.788 --> 07:14:49.798 align:start position:0%
entitling civil litigants to a jury
 
07:14:51.250 --> 07:14:51.260 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
07:14:55.128 --> 07:14:55.138 align:start position:0%
the Constitution part 1 article 20
 
07:14:57.590 --> 07:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
provides that a civil litigant is
 
07:14:59.390 --> 07:14:59.400 align:start position:0%
entitled to a jury trial if the amount
 
07:15:01.968 --> 07:15:01.978 align:start position:0%
is fifteen hundred dollars or more
 
07:15:03.830 --> 07:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
a Class B misdemeanor in New Hampshire
 
07:15:07.190 --> 07:15:07.200 align:start position:0%
is up to a twelve hundred dollar fine
 
07:15:10.610 --> 07:15:10.620 align:start position:0%
when you add a 24 penalty assessment you
 
07:15:12.410 --> 07:15:12.420 align:start position:0%
get to one thousand four hundred and
 
07:15:13.730 --> 07:15:13.740 align:start position:0%
eighty eight dollars
 
07:15:15.468 --> 07:15:15.478 align:start position:0%
and I always wondered why it was 24
 
07:15:18.890 --> 07:15:18.900 align:start position:0%
because the math is hard to do on 24 and
 
07:15:20.868 --> 07:15:20.878 align:start position:0%
was like why didn't the legislature just
 
07:15:23.690 --> 07:15:23.700 align:start position:0%
go to 25 because the math would be so
 
07:15:25.910 --> 07:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
much easier and I suspect that the
 
07:15:27.770 --> 07:15:27.780 align:start position:0%
reason the legislature didn't go to 25
 
07:15:30.468 --> 07:15:30.478 align:start position:0%
percent is because a 25 penalty
 
07:15:31.730 --> 07:15:31.740 align:start position:0%
assessment we make the total fine
 
07:15:34.430 --> 07:15:34.440 align:start position:0%
fifteen hundred dollars
 
07:15:37.730 --> 07:15:37.740 align:start position:0%
which again is the threshold for civil
 
07:15:40.430 --> 07:15:40.440 align:start position:0%
jury trials which would then Grant
 
07:15:42.230 --> 07:15:42.240 align:start position:0%
everybody charged with the Class B
 
07:15:43.610 --> 07:15:43.620 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor in the city of New Hampshire
 
07:15:45.708 --> 07:15:45.718 align:start position:0%
at the right to a jury trial
 
07:15:47.390 --> 07:15:47.400 align:start position:0%
if you increase the penalty assessment
 
07:15:50.510 --> 07:15:50.520 align:start position:0%
to 30 percent uh the maximum potential
 
07:15:52.670 --> 07:15:52.680 align:start position:0%
penalty for a Class B misdemeanor would
 
07:15:52.680 --> 07:15:53.410 align:start position:0%
penalty for a Class B misdemeanor would
be

07:15:53.410 --> 07:15:53.420 align:start position:0%
be
 
07:15:57.230 --> 07:15:57.240 align:start position:0%
1560 which again exceeds that fifteen
 
07:15:59.390 --> 07:15:59.400 align:start position:0%
hundred dollar threshold and if you put
 
07:16:01.070 --> 07:16:01.080 align:start position:0%
in a provision that there would be an
 
07:16:02.868 --> 07:16:02.878 align:start position:0%
additional penalty assessment of fifty
 
07:16:05.208 --> 07:16:05.218 align:start position:0%
dollars on every case for alcohol or
 
07:16:06.650 --> 07:16:06.660 align:start position:0%
controlled drugs
 
07:16:09.190 --> 07:16:09.200 align:start position:0%
that would make our current 24
 
07:16:11.628 --> 07:16:11.638 align:start position:0%
penalty assessment exceed fifteen
 
07:16:14.270 --> 07:16:14.280 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars in many Class B
 
07:16:16.730 --> 07:16:16.740 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors so I think that the
 
07:16:19.670 --> 07:16:19.680 align:start position:0%
unintended consequence of increasing the
 
07:16:21.770 --> 07:16:21.780 align:start position:0%
penalty assessment would be somewhat
 
07:16:24.048 --> 07:16:24.058 align:start position:0%
catastrophic on the circuit courts where
 
07:16:25.670 --> 07:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
now everyone charged with Class B
 
07:16:27.830 --> 07:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor would be entitled to a jury
 
07:16:30.410 --> 07:16:30.420 align:start position:0%
trial as I had indicated earlier
 
07:16:32.330 --> 07:16:32.340 align:start position:0%
attorney straussen and I had reached out
 
07:16:34.788 --> 07:16:34.798 align:start position:0%
to the other County attorneys and I can
 
07:16:37.610 --> 07:16:37.620 align:start position:0%
indicate that we've heard back from
 
07:16:39.468 --> 07:16:39.478 align:start position:0%
attorney Halverson from Merrimack County
 
07:16:41.810 --> 07:16:41.820 align:start position:0%
who opposes this bill Cheshire county
 
07:16:43.788 --> 07:16:43.798 align:start position:0%
attorney Chris McDonald opposes the bill
 
07:16:45.708 --> 07:16:45.718 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County attorney Pat Conway
 
07:16:48.048 --> 07:16:48.058 align:start position:0%
opposes the Bill Carroll County attorney
 
07:16:50.990 --> 07:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
and druzy opposes the bill of coax
 
07:16:52.730 --> 07:16:52.740 align:start position:0%
County Attorney John McCormick poses the
 
07:16:54.590 --> 07:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
bill Belknap County attorney Andrew
 
07:16:56.628 --> 07:16:56.638 align:start position:0%
Livernois opposes the bill in Grafton
 
07:16:59.270 --> 07:16:59.280 align:start position:0%
County attorney Marshall Hornick opposes
 
07:17:00.890 --> 07:17:00.900 align:start position:0%
the bill we didn't hear back from anyone
 
07:17:03.650 --> 07:17:03.660 align:start position:0%
saying they were in favor of it
 
07:17:06.288 --> 07:17:06.298 align:start position:0%
so happy to answer any questions you
 
07:17:08.390 --> 07:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
have about process or the Wake things
 
07:17:10.670 --> 07:17:10.680 align:start position:0%
currently work or any other issues that
 
07:17:13.490 --> 07:17:13.500 align:start position:0%
we see thank you um I have a couple of
 
07:17:16.010 --> 07:17:16.020 align:start position:0%
quick questions so with regard to the
 
07:17:17.270 --> 07:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
the blood
 
07:17:17.280 --> 07:17:18.170 align:start position:0%
the blood
um

07:17:18.170 --> 07:17:18.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:17:20.868 --> 07:17:20.878 align:start position:0%
they have I believe you indicated 30
 
07:17:22.490 --> 07:17:22.500 align:start position:0%
days they get a notice they have 30 days
 
07:17:24.708 --> 07:17:24.718 align:start position:0%
to request it is it not true that they
 
07:17:26.628 --> 07:17:26.638 align:start position:0%
oftentimes don't have Council assigned
 
07:17:30.410 --> 07:17:30.420 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:30.420 --> 07:17:32.690 align:start position:0%
 
so

07:17:32.690 --> 07:17:32.700 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:17:35.150 --> 07:17:35.160 align:start position:0%
for a first offense DWI you wouldn't be
 
07:17:36.650 --> 07:17:36.660 align:start position:0%
entitled to a court appointed Council
 
07:17:39.410 --> 07:17:39.420 align:start position:0%
because it's a Class B missed me so
 
07:17:42.650 --> 07:17:42.660 align:start position:0%
you'd get arrested for DWI there'd be a
 
07:17:44.448 --> 07:17:44.458 align:start position:0%
blood draw that night the blood would be
 
07:17:47.510 --> 07:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
sent to the lab there's some delay in
 
07:17:49.250 --> 07:17:49.260 align:start position:0%
testing the blood
 
07:17:51.468 --> 07:17:51.478 align:start position:0%
after the blood is tested you're sent a
 
07:17:53.448 --> 07:17:53.458 align:start position:0%
certified letter saying these are your
 
07:17:55.548 --> 07:17:55.558 align:start position:0%
blood results and you have 30 days to to
 
07:17:56.690 --> 07:17:56.700 align:start position:0%
pick it up
 
07:17:59.150 --> 07:17:59.160 align:start position:0%
so it is absolutely possible that you
 
07:18:01.128 --> 07:18:01.138 align:start position:0%
have not hired an attorney at that point
 
07:18:04.930 --> 07:18:04.940 align:start position:0%
but that would be roughly
 
07:18:11.990 --> 07:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
60 days after the incident so if
 
07:18:14.330 --> 07:18:14.340 align:start position:0%
I've never tried to hire a DWI attorney
 
07:18:17.208 --> 07:18:17.218 align:start position:0%
I was talking about more about a sign if
 
07:18:18.890 --> 07:18:18.900 align:start position:0%
you were let's say second offense right
 
07:18:21.170 --> 07:18:21.180 align:start position:0%
if it was the second offense I believe
 
07:18:22.368 --> 07:18:22.378 align:start position:0%
that the
 
07:18:22.378 --> 07:18:23.868 align:start position:0%
that the
the current

07:18:23.868 --> 07:18:23.878 align:start position:0%
the current
 
07:18:27.048 --> 07:18:27.058 align:start position:0%
State of Affairs is that a arraignment
 
07:18:29.570 --> 07:18:29.580 align:start position:0%
is scheduled no less than 14 and no more
 
07:18:32.390 --> 07:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
than 30 days out so you'd be in court
 
07:18:35.570 --> 07:18:35.580 align:start position:0%
within 30 days of the offense you'd be
 
07:18:38.570 --> 07:18:38.580 align:start position:0%
appointed counsel at that point
 
07:18:40.850 --> 07:18:40.860 align:start position:0%
if the public defender's office had
 
07:18:44.208 --> 07:18:44.218 align:start position:0%
enough attorneys I think after leaving
 
07:18:46.010 --> 07:18:46.020 align:start position:0%
your arraignment you'd be able to call
 
07:18:47.510 --> 07:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
the public defender's office and speak
 
07:18:49.788 --> 07:18:49.798 align:start position:0%
to your attorney at that point so you
 
07:18:50.810 --> 07:18:50.820 align:start position:0%
would definitely have the public
 
07:18:52.368 --> 07:18:52.378 align:start position:0%
defender's office assigned I believe
 
07:18:56.330 --> 07:18:56.340 align:start position:0%
 
07:18:58.670 --> 07:18:58.680 align:start position:0%
um also I wanted to ask if you could
 
07:19:01.430 --> 07:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
send those sites that you you listed um
 
07:19:03.468 --> 07:19:03.478 align:start position:0%
absolutely just even if it's just the
 
07:19:03.478 --> 07:19:04.968 align:start position:0%
absolutely just even if it's just the
links

07:19:04.968 --> 07:19:04.978 align:start position:0%
links
 
07:19:04.978 --> 07:19:06.350 align:start position:0%
links
um

07:19:06.350 --> 07:19:06.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:19:08.448 --> 07:19:08.458 align:start position:0%
could you tell me the the law currently
 
07:19:11.810 --> 07:19:11.820 align:start position:0%
on on Federal Criminal depositions
 
07:19:14.270 --> 07:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
if you know it yeah the federal standard
 
07:19:15.708 --> 07:19:15.718 align:start position:0%
I don't know what the federal standard
 
07:19:17.030 --> 07:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
is I mean it doesn't apply in New
 
07:19:18.788 --> 07:19:18.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire no I'm curious though
 
07:19:21.288 --> 07:19:21.298 align:start position:0%
I know it's against state to state I
 
07:19:22.670 --> 07:19:22.680 align:start position:0%
only know it from talking to other
 
07:19:24.410 --> 07:19:24.420 align:start position:0%
practitioners some states that there's
 
07:19:26.208 --> 07:19:26.218 align:start position:0%
no criminal depositions at all often we
 
07:19:27.530 --> 07:19:27.540 align:start position:0%
hire people from other states they're
 
07:19:28.730 --> 07:19:28.740 align:start position:0%
shocked to find out that we have
 
07:19:30.830 --> 07:19:30.840 align:start position:0%
criminal depositions okay
 
07:19:32.930 --> 07:19:32.940 align:start position:0%
um but in New Hampshire again mandatory
 
07:19:34.968 --> 07:19:34.978 align:start position:0%
for experts and other side discretionary
 
07:19:37.850 --> 07:19:37.860 align:start position:0%
as to others and and my last question
 
07:19:40.430 --> 07:19:40.440 align:start position:0%
was um regarding the criminal
 
07:19:42.830 --> 07:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
um the criminal record for bail
 
07:19:45.468 --> 07:19:45.478 align:start position:0%
is the current state that a defendant
 
07:19:48.110 --> 07:19:48.120 align:start position:0%
can be at a bail hearing and not know or
 
07:19:50.990 --> 07:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
have his own own criminal record but the
 
07:19:53.570 --> 07:19:53.580 align:start position:0%
the prosecutor does have it and they
 
07:19:56.030 --> 07:19:56.040 align:start position:0%
don't get access to it right so
 
07:19:59.030 --> 07:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire if you're arrested and
 
07:20:01.010 --> 07:20:01.020 align:start position:0%
the bail commissioner sets either cash
 
07:20:02.750 --> 07:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
bail that you can't make a preventative
 
07:20:04.850 --> 07:20:04.860 align:start position:0%
detention you're entitled to a bail
 
07:20:06.788 --> 07:20:06.798 align:start position:0%
hearing within 24 hours
 
07:20:08.868 --> 07:20:08.878 align:start position:0%
so you're transported from the police
 
07:20:10.850 --> 07:20:10.860 align:start position:0%
station to the House of Corrections and
 
07:20:12.350 --> 07:20:12.360 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire they do most of those
 
07:20:13.910 --> 07:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
hearings by video
 
07:20:16.670 --> 07:20:16.680 align:start position:0%
so at the video arraignment especially
 
07:20:18.890 --> 07:20:18.900 align:start position:0%
in Circuit Court the Circuit Court
 
07:20:21.230 --> 07:20:21.240 align:start position:0%
prosecutor would get the file that
 
07:20:24.590 --> 07:20:24.600 align:start position:0%
morning and do a presentation to the
 
07:20:26.930 --> 07:20:26.940 align:start position:0%
court making a recommendation for bail
 
07:20:29.208 --> 07:20:29.218 align:start position:0%
the Circuit Court prosecutors generally
 
07:20:31.190 --> 07:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
would get the criminal record from the
 
07:20:33.830 --> 07:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
police department and present that to
 
07:20:36.468 --> 07:20:36.478 align:start position:0%
the court the defendant would be in the
 
07:20:38.090 --> 07:20:38.100 align:start position:0%
house Corrections so it's absolutely
 
07:20:40.670 --> 07:20:40.680 align:start position:0%
possible that the Circuit Court
 
07:20:43.610 --> 07:20:43.620 align:start position:0%
prosecutor wouldn't be able to get a
 
07:20:46.730 --> 07:20:46.740 align:start position:0%
physical copy of that criminal record to
 
07:20:48.650 --> 07:20:48.660 align:start position:0%
the defendant in court
 
07:20:51.650 --> 07:20:51.660 align:start position:0%
having said that the under the New
 
07:20:53.090 --> 07:20:53.100 align:start position:0%
Hampshire rules of criminal procedure
 
07:20:57.650 --> 07:20:57.660 align:start position:0%
rule 5e if a person is unrepresented at
 
07:21:00.770 --> 07:21:00.780 align:start position:0%
that hearing they get a second hearing
 
07:21:04.190 --> 07:21:04.200 align:start position:0%
upon request of counsel within 24 apps
 
07:21:08.090 --> 07:21:08.100 align:start position:0%
so while it is absolutely possible that
 
07:21:10.430 --> 07:21:10.440 align:start position:0%
the defendant doesn't have a copy of his
 
07:21:12.590 --> 07:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
criminal record at that initial bail
 
07:21:14.930 --> 07:21:14.940 align:start position:0%
hearing there's a number of safeguards
 
07:21:17.090 --> 07:21:17.100 align:start position:0%
already in place so that they can have
 
07:21:19.368 --> 07:21:19.378 align:start position:0%
subsequent hearings which they can
 
07:21:22.968 --> 07:21:22.978 align:start position:0%
prepare for the concern that was brought
 
07:21:24.890 --> 07:21:24.900 align:start position:0%
to the Supreme Court was that as a
 
07:21:26.750 --> 07:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
circuit court prosecutor
 
07:21:29.030 --> 07:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
we often didn't know who was
 
07:21:31.070 --> 07:21:31.080 align:start position:0%
representing the defendant if anyone was
 
07:21:32.990 --> 07:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
representing the defendant and it made
 
07:21:35.150 --> 07:21:35.160 align:start position:0%
it very difficult to try and get these
 
07:21:37.670 --> 07:21:37.680 align:start position:0%
records to the defendant the the
 
07:21:39.468 --> 07:21:39.478 align:start position:0%
criminal records themselves are also
 
07:21:41.810 --> 07:21:41.820 align:start position:0%
subject to a number of Rules from the
 
07:21:45.890 --> 07:21:45.900 align:start position:0%
FBI's cjis so they can't be emailed they
 
07:21:48.350 --> 07:21:48.360 align:start position:0%
have to be faxed it creates problems of
 
07:21:51.948 --> 07:21:51.958 align:start position:0%
how to get this to the person
 
07:21:51.958 --> 07:21:54.948 align:start position:0%
how to get this to the person
so

07:21:54.948 --> 07:21:54.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:21:57.830 --> 07:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
any question representative Rhodes thank
 
07:21:59.330 --> 07:21:59.340 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
07:21:59.340 --> 07:22:00.170 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you for taking my
question

07:22:00.170 --> 07:22:00.180 align:start position:0%
question
 
07:22:03.948 --> 07:22:03.958 align:start position:0%
in regards to line 29 on the first page
 
07:22:07.788 --> 07:22:07.798 align:start position:0%
about right to Media
 
07:22:11.270 --> 07:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
it if the defendant is an example is
 
07:22:14.448 --> 07:22:14.458 align:start position:0%
just in engulfed in say the glory of of
 
07:22:16.128 --> 07:22:16.138 align:start position:0%
the horrificness because unfortunately I
 
07:22:18.530 --> 07:22:18.540 align:start position:0%
believe that that happens sometimes what
 
07:22:20.868 --> 07:22:20.878 align:start position:0%
would prevent the defendant if he has
 
07:22:24.170 --> 07:22:24.180 align:start position:0%
you know say a a camera in front of him
 
07:22:28.070 --> 07:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
from giving some details and the def in
 
07:22:29.628 --> 07:22:29.638 align:start position:0%
the the victim's name or the
 
07:22:31.850 --> 07:22:31.860 align:start position:0%
circumstances surrounding it
 
07:22:34.610 --> 07:22:34.620 align:start position:0%
no nothing so
 
07:22:37.310 --> 07:22:37.320 align:start position:0%
cross here in 25 years I've never seen a
 
07:22:39.410 --> 07:22:39.420 align:start position:0%
court impose any kind of a gag order on
 
07:22:40.730 --> 07:22:40.740 align:start position:0%
defendant ever
 
07:22:43.128 --> 07:22:43.138 align:start position:0%
ever it's the lawyers who are subject to
 
07:22:44.868 --> 07:22:44.878 align:start position:0%
the most professional conduct about what
 
07:22:46.548 --> 07:22:46.558 align:start position:0%
we can say so we don't Prejudice the
 
07:22:48.890 --> 07:22:48.900 align:start position:0%
defendant either side but the rules
 
07:22:50.990 --> 07:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
obviously only address attorneys I don't
 
07:22:53.150 --> 07:22:53.160 align:start position:0%
know of any of any provision that
 
07:22:55.548 --> 07:22:55.558 align:start position:0%
addresses a defendant now a judge could
 
07:22:57.170 --> 07:22:57.180 align:start position:0%
decide that the defendant is making
 
07:22:59.390 --> 07:22:59.400 align:start position:0%
statements that prejudice someone's
 
07:23:01.788 --> 07:23:01.798 align:start position:0%
right to a fair trial but that's pretty
 
07:23:03.468 --> 07:23:03.478 align:start position:0%
rare again I can't it's never happened
 
07:23:05.330 --> 07:23:05.340 align:start position:0%
that I've seen it in my time I can't
 
07:23:07.490 --> 07:23:07.500 align:start position:0%
even think of a case of New Hampshire I
 
07:23:09.110 --> 07:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
can think of many defendants in
 
07:23:10.788 --> 07:23:10.798 align:start position:0%
Notorious cases including some my own
 
07:23:12.530 --> 07:23:12.540 align:start position:0%
who stepped out and talked to the media
 
07:23:14.270 --> 07:23:14.280 align:start position:0%
I didn't try to stop them I was happy
 
07:23:17.448 --> 07:23:17.458 align:start position:0%
they were speaking so yeah I'm not sure
 
07:23:19.070 --> 07:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
what that's trying to that's trying to
 
07:23:21.530 --> 07:23:21.540 align:start position:0%
get at but quite frankly as a prosecutor
 
07:23:23.570 --> 07:23:23.580 align:start position:0%
I'm perfectly happy if Defender wants to
 
07:23:25.190 --> 07:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
talk to the news media nine times out of
 
07:23:27.610 --> 07:23:27.620 align:start position:0%
ten it's very helpful for my case
 
07:23:30.110 --> 07:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
it just is so
 
07:23:32.810 --> 07:23:32.820 align:start position:0%
you know yeah I mean I had a defendant
 
07:23:36.170 --> 07:23:36.180 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:40.190 --> 07:23:40.200 align:start position:0%
that's his choice representative Bolden
 
07:23:41.750 --> 07:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:23:44.570 --> 07:23:44.580 align:start position:0%
um thanks for taking my question
 
07:23:44.580 --> 07:23:45.110 align:start position:0%
um thanks for taking my question
um

07:23:45.110 --> 07:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:23:47.030 --> 07:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
I'm not gonna claim to know anything
 
07:23:49.430 --> 07:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
near as much as you know
 
07:23:51.230 --> 07:23:51.240 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately about the criminal
 
07:23:54.590 --> 07:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
justice system but um it seems like the
 
07:23:56.990 --> 07:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
the sponsor's intent maybe was to um
 
07:24:00.288 --> 07:24:00.298 align:start position:0%
impart to cement uh some Supreme Court
 
07:24:03.048 --> 07:24:03.058 align:start position:0%
decisions in state law and I know that
 
07:24:05.390 --> 07:24:05.400 align:start position:0%
those can change over time
 
07:24:07.368 --> 07:24:07.378 align:start position:0%
um and you know some did rather recently
 
07:24:09.910 --> 07:24:09.920 align:start position:0%
regarding other topics um
 
07:24:13.730 --> 07:24:13.740 align:start position:0%
would you have any opposition to maybe
 
07:24:15.650 --> 07:24:15.660 align:start position:0%
amending the bill just to include the
 
07:24:17.570 --> 07:24:17.580 align:start position:0%
areas that the sponsor was just trying
 
07:24:20.208 --> 07:24:20.218 align:start position:0%
to convert Supreme Court decisions to
 
07:24:21.288 --> 07:24:21.298 align:start position:0%
state law
 
07:24:23.810 --> 07:24:23.820 align:start position:0%
yes because most all of this is also
 
07:24:24.830 --> 07:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
addressed by our New Hampshire
 
07:24:24.840 --> 07:24:26.030 align:start position:0%
addressed by our New Hampshire
Constitution

07:24:26.030 --> 07:24:26.040 align:start position:0%
Constitution
 
07:24:28.368 --> 07:24:28.378 align:start position:0%
so there's just no need a lot of this
 
07:24:29.750 --> 07:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
already exists in the New Hampshire
 
07:24:32.628 --> 07:24:32.638 align:start position:0%
Constitution but what doesn't exist is
 
07:24:35.750 --> 07:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
these set day deadlines and that again
 
07:24:38.990 --> 07:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
is Impractical and unnecessary some
 
07:24:41.090 --> 07:24:41.100 align:start position:0%
cases are quicker than others some move
 
07:24:43.368 --> 07:24:43.378 align:start position:0%
slower than others so to set an
 
07:24:45.230 --> 07:24:45.240 align:start position:0%
artificial deadline makes no sense what
 
07:24:47.030 --> 07:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
makes sense is that what tip Gavin's the
 
07:24:48.590 --> 07:24:48.600 align:start position:0%
parties get together and talk with the
 
07:24:50.150 --> 07:24:50.160 align:start position:0%
judge about what they think a realistic
 
07:24:52.490 --> 07:24:52.500 align:start position:0%
date or deadline is and sometimes
 
07:24:54.830 --> 07:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
defendants want quicker trials but their
 
07:24:56.930 --> 07:24:56.940 align:start position:0%
lawyers saying I can't be ready it makes
 
07:24:58.850 --> 07:24:58.860 align:start position:0%
no sense so they have that they have
 
07:25:00.410 --> 07:25:00.420 align:start position:0%
that Push Pull with their client or
 
07:25:01.548 --> 07:25:01.558 align:start position:0%
their client's like I want a trial
 
07:25:03.590 --> 07:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
yesterday and always like I can't get
 
07:25:05.330 --> 07:25:05.340 align:start position:0%
the expert I can't do what I need to do
 
07:25:06.830 --> 07:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
so that's where some of that tugging
 
07:25:06.840 --> 07:25:10.490 align:start position:0%
so that's where some of that tugging
comes

07:25:10.490 --> 07:25:10.500 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:12.708 --> 07:25:12.718 align:start position:0%
thank you I understand
 
07:25:14.930 --> 07:25:14.940 align:start position:0%
um that a lot of the things included in
 
07:25:16.490 --> 07:25:16.500 align:start position:0%
the bill haven't come out of Supreme
 
07:25:18.468 --> 07:25:18.478 align:start position:0%
Court decisions but for example The
 
07:25:21.170 --> 07:25:21.180 align:start position:0%
Mention Of exculpatory evidence isn't
 
07:25:24.170 --> 07:25:24.180 align:start position:0%
that Brady is that the right one
 
07:25:26.810 --> 07:25:26.820 align:start position:0%
um right also it's also cloudifying New
 
07:25:28.310 --> 07:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution about all groups
 
07:25:30.590 --> 07:25:30.600 align:start position:0%
favorable so again it's already covered
 
07:25:34.850 --> 07:25:34.860 align:start position:0%
there okay so are you so so you're
 
07:25:37.368 --> 07:25:37.378 align:start position:0%
saying that that you feel that the um
 
07:25:38.990 --> 07:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
Brady decision didn't affect New
 
07:25:40.730 --> 07:25:40.740 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because it was already an
 
07:25:43.368 --> 07:25:43.378 align:start position:0%
aspect of our constitution
 
07:25:46.128 --> 07:25:46.138 align:start position:0%
the exculpatory evidence section is with
 
07:25:47.990 --> 07:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
reference to the grand jury
 
07:25:48.000 --> 07:25:49.190 align:start position:0%
reference to the grand jury
which

07:25:49.190 --> 07:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
which
 
07:25:52.670 --> 07:25:52.680 align:start position:0%
there is no right to have exculpatory
 
07:25:55.128 --> 07:25:55.138 align:start position:0%
evidence presented for the grand jury so
 
07:25:56.750 --> 07:25:56.760 align:start position:0%
that's that's actually not a
 
07:25:56.760 --> 07:25:58.548 align:start position:0%
that's that's actually not a
constitutional

07:25:58.548 --> 07:25:58.558 align:start position:0%
constitutional
 
07:26:01.490 --> 07:26:01.500 align:start position:0%
right in the correct so in the bill it
 
07:26:02.570 --> 07:26:02.580 align:start position:0%
talks about
 
07:26:05.448 --> 07:26:05.458 align:start position:0%
uh 604 11 would create exculp 3 evidence
 
07:26:07.850 --> 07:26:07.860 align:start position:0%
provided to the grand jury a defendant
 
07:26:08.868 --> 07:26:08.878 align:start position:0%
shall be entitled to the state
 
07:26:10.910 --> 07:26:10.920 align:start position:0%
presenting all exculpatory evidence to a
 
07:26:12.230 --> 07:26:12.240 align:start position:0%
grand jury
 
07:26:14.650 --> 07:26:14.660 align:start position:0%
that's not a constitutional right
 
07:26:17.208 --> 07:26:17.218 align:start position:0%
both the New Hampshire and U.S Supreme
 
07:26:18.650 --> 07:26:18.660 align:start position:0%
Court have actually
 
07:26:21.288 --> 07:26:21.298 align:start position:0%
said the exact opposite of that the
 
07:26:22.968 --> 07:26:22.978 align:start position:0%
constitutional right is a trial right
 
07:26:24.350 --> 07:26:24.360 align:start position:0%
where you go in and you have your guilt
 
07:26:25.910 --> 07:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
earnestness decided and that's not what
 
07:26:29.330 --> 07:26:29.340 align:start position:0%
 
07:26:31.070 --> 07:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
representative saley
 
07:26:34.310 --> 07:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um so just out of
 
07:26:36.110 --> 07:26:36.120 align:start position:0%
curiosity looking at the timelines for
 
07:26:39.770 --> 07:26:39.780 align:start position:0%
this if if we were to theoretically
 
07:26:44.510 --> 07:26:44.520 align:start position:0%
um meet the 90-day and 120 day and 180
 
07:26:46.788 --> 07:26:46.798 align:start position:0%
day and we were just looking at State
 
07:26:49.010 --> 07:26:49.020 align:start position:0%
trials not County we'll put those aside
 
07:26:50.570 --> 07:26:50.580 align:start position:0%
for this question
 
07:26:53.448 --> 07:26:53.458 align:start position:0%
how many additional attorneys attorney
 
07:26:56.208 --> 07:26:56.218 align:start position:0%
support staff judges judges support
 
07:26:58.368 --> 07:26:58.378 align:start position:0%
staff and defense attorneys would we
 
07:27:01.070 --> 07:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
need to clear the current caseload in
 
07:27:04.670 --> 07:27:04.680 align:start position:0%
that timeline let alone any new cases
 
07:27:06.530 --> 07:27:06.540 align:start position:0%
I mean you would be talking
 
07:27:09.110 --> 07:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
dozens and dozens and dozens of people I
 
07:27:09.120 --> 07:27:09.830 align:start position:0%
dozens and dozens and dozens of people I
mean

07:27:09.830 --> 07:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
mean
 
07:27:13.070 --> 07:27:13.080 align:start position:0%
right now probably 90 percent or so of
 
07:27:16.448 --> 07:27:16.458 align:start position:0%
cases are resolved with plea Bargains
 
07:27:19.670 --> 07:27:19.680 align:start position:0%
imagine if you were to just reduce that
 
07:27:21.948 --> 07:27:21.958 align:start position:0%
number by 10 percent
 
07:27:23.810 --> 07:27:23.820 align:start position:0%
the number of personnel that you would
 
07:27:26.868 --> 07:27:26.878 align:start position:0%
need would be astronomical and again if
 
07:27:28.128 --> 07:27:28.138 align:start position:0%
your average defense attorney has
 
07:27:30.468 --> 07:27:30.478 align:start position:0%
between 100 you know 100 100 or so cases
 
07:27:32.628 --> 07:27:32.638 align:start position:0%
your prosecutors got 100 200 cases so
 
07:27:34.128 --> 07:27:34.138 align:start position:0%
let's say you wanted to cut those in
 
07:27:35.570 --> 07:27:35.580 align:start position:0%
half but that means you've got to double
 
07:27:37.250 --> 07:27:37.260 align:start position:0%
the amount of those people and you're
 
07:27:38.628 --> 07:27:38.638 align:start position:0%
gonna have to double the judges because
 
07:27:41.090 --> 07:27:41.100 align:start position:0%
that means judges have got to deal with
 
07:27:44.030 --> 07:27:44.040 align:start position:0%
more cases quicker so again you talking
 
07:27:45.890 --> 07:27:45.900 align:start position:0%
tens of millions of dollars to try to
 
07:27:46.910 --> 07:27:46.920 align:start position:0%
meet these deadlines and they're not
 
07:27:47.990 --> 07:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
going to be realistic because the
 
07:27:49.310 --> 07:27:49.320 align:start position:0%
lawyers are still not going to be ready
 
07:27:50.628 --> 07:27:50.638 align:start position:0%
because if you've got to depose 50
 
07:27:54.048 --> 07:27:54.058 align:start position:0%
Witnesses you can't meet those deadlines
 
07:27:54.058 --> 07:27:55.490 align:start position:0%
Witnesses you can't meet those deadlines
welcome

07:27:55.490 --> 07:27:55.500 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
07:27:57.830 --> 07:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler thank you Mr
 
07:27:59.390 --> 07:27:59.400 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for all the
 
07:28:01.190 --> 07:28:01.200 align:start position:0%
information really helpful I think the
 
07:28:02.868 --> 07:28:02.878 align:start position:0%
only question I had was what Supreme
 
07:28:05.330 --> 07:28:05.340 align:start position:0%
Court decision what was the Supreme
 
07:28:07.368 --> 07:28:07.378 align:start position:0%
Court decision or decisions that dealt
 
07:28:10.490 --> 07:28:10.500 align:start position:0%
with uh the guidelines for how police
 
07:28:13.548 --> 07:28:13.558 align:start position:0%
could deceive uh someone that they
 
07:28:15.410 --> 07:28:15.420 align:start position:0%
attained I don't remember the names of
 
07:28:16.730 --> 07:28:16.740 align:start position:0%
the cases I mean I've looked at them but
 
07:28:18.170 --> 07:28:18.180 align:start position:0%
they're typically you were Supreme Court
 
07:28:18.180 --> 07:28:19.850 align:start position:0%
they're typically you were Supreme Court
cases

07:28:19.850 --> 07:28:19.860 align:start position:0%
cases
 
07:28:23.510 --> 07:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
so the the U.S Supreme Court case is
 
07:28:25.430 --> 07:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
Fraser versus cup
 
07:28:25.440 --> 07:28:27.250 align:start position:0%
Fraser versus cup
it's

07:28:27.250 --> 07:28:27.260 align:start position:0%
it's
 
07:28:30.590 --> 07:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
f-r-a-z-i-e-r versus cup c-u-p-p it's at
 
07:28:35.930 --> 07:28:35.940 align:start position:0%
394 us 731 it's a 1969 case
 
07:28:38.090 --> 07:28:38.100 align:start position:0%
and I believe it's also referenced in
 
07:28:40.310 --> 07:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and State versus wood
 
07:28:42.650 --> 07:28:42.660 align:start position:0%
which you can be found at 128 New
 
07:28:47.208 --> 07:28:47.218 align:start position:0%
Hampshire 739 I'd say 1986 case and to
 
07:28:49.548 --> 07:28:49.558 align:start position:0%
be clear the court has said that while
 
07:28:51.770 --> 07:28:51.780 align:start position:0%
officers may use deception or blocks to
 
07:28:53.510 --> 07:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
get information from
 
07:28:55.968 --> 07:28:55.978 align:start position:0%
suspects they can't do that to get a
 
07:28:58.070 --> 07:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
Miranda okay right you can never do that
 
07:28:59.628 --> 07:28:59.638 align:start position:0%
to get a breakup thank you very much
 
07:29:05.690 --> 07:29:05.700 align:start position:0%
 
07:29:07.850 --> 07:29:07.860 align:start position:0%
is anybody
 
07:29:09.890 --> 07:29:09.900 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony and
 
07:29:15.288 --> 07:29:15.298 align:start position:0%
 
07:29:17.090 --> 07:29:17.100 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes Attorney Richard
 
07:29:26.628 --> 07:29:26.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:29:28.128 --> 07:29:28.138 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you members
 
07:29:29.628 --> 07:29:29.638 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is Richard head
 
07:29:31.128 --> 07:29:31.138 align:start position:0%
I'm the government Affairs coordinator
 
07:29:33.490 --> 07:29:33.500 align:start position:0%
for the judicial branch
 
07:29:36.350 --> 07:29:36.360 align:start position:0%
my intend is to talk about
 
07:29:39.530 --> 07:29:39.540 align:start position:0%
um how this impacts Court resources
 
07:29:40.850 --> 07:29:40.860 align:start position:0%
Court schedules
 
07:29:43.368 --> 07:29:43.378 align:start position:0%
I think one of the one of the most
 
07:29:46.128 --> 07:29:46.138 align:start position:0%
important resources the the court system
 
07:29:49.610 --> 07:29:49.620 align:start position:0%
has is the daily docket the daily docket
 
07:29:52.548 --> 07:29:52.558 align:start position:0%
is the calendar which governs what the
 
07:29:53.810 --> 07:29:53.820 align:start position:0%
judge is going to be doing in a
 
07:29:56.208 --> 07:29:56.218 align:start position:0%
courtroom on a particular day there are
 
07:29:58.610 --> 07:29:58.620 align:start position:0%
seven and a half hours in a day in terms
 
07:30:01.548 --> 07:30:01.558 align:start position:0%
of court time there's one judge that
 
07:30:03.948 --> 07:30:03.958 align:start position:0%
judge can only do what's in the docket
 
07:30:06.948 --> 07:30:06.958 align:start position:0%
in that day in that courtroom
 
07:30:09.948 --> 07:30:09.958 align:start position:0%
um as you may remember when we gave our
 
07:30:12.730 --> 07:30:12.740 align:start position:0%
initial presentation if you take Concord
 
07:30:15.288 --> 07:30:15.298 align:start position:0%
circuit court for example Monday
 
07:30:17.330 --> 07:30:17.340 align:start position:0%
morning's docket is already full that's
 
07:30:19.610 --> 07:30:19.620 align:start position:0%
going to be arraignment it's going to
 
07:30:21.350 --> 07:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
either be video or live arraignments so
 
07:30:23.810 --> 07:30:23.820 align:start position:0%
that duck gets full Monday afternoon's
 
07:30:24.968 --> 07:30:24.978 align:start position:0%
already full
 
07:30:27.590 --> 07:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
Friday morning's already full Friday
 
07:30:29.868 --> 07:30:29.878 align:start position:0%
afternoon's already full we have a lot
 
07:30:31.968 --> 07:30:31.978 align:start position:0%
of dockets that sort of have things that
 
07:30:35.330 --> 07:30:35.340 align:start position:0%
are already in it so those dockets are
 
07:30:37.368 --> 07:30:37.378 align:start position:0%
not available
 
07:30:37.378 --> 07:30:38.750 align:start position:0%
not available
um so

07:30:38.750 --> 07:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
um so
 
07:30:40.250 --> 07:30:40.260 align:start position:0%
so what
 
07:30:43.190 --> 07:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
a Clerk's job is is to balance and and
 
07:30:45.830 --> 07:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
the judge's job is to balance a
 
07:30:48.890 --> 07:30:48.900 align:start position:0%
remarkable number of things
 
07:30:50.690 --> 07:30:50.700 align:start position:0%
um they're balancing constitutional
 
07:30:53.690 --> 07:30:53.700 align:start position:0%
rights speedy trial uh whatever it may
 
07:30:57.650 --> 07:30:57.660 align:start position:0%
be they're balancing uh physical harm to
 
07:31:00.708 --> 07:31:00.718 align:start position:0%
people uh emergency domestic violence
 
07:31:03.048 --> 07:31:03.058 align:start position:0%
emergency petition
 
07:31:06.830 --> 07:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
they're balancing the age of cases civil
 
07:31:09.070 --> 07:31:09.080 align:start position:0%
cases that are pending in the courthouse
 
07:31:12.230 --> 07:31:12.240 align:start position:0%
they're balancing mandatory deadlines
 
07:31:14.150 --> 07:31:14.160 align:start position:0%
that are set by the legislature in
 
07:31:16.850 --> 07:31:16.860 align:start position:0%
statute those have to be met landlord
 
07:31:19.310 --> 07:31:19.320 align:start position:0%
tenant cases they have uh I think it's
 
07:31:23.830 --> 07:31:23.840 align:start position:0%
for 10 days uh after the after the uh
 
07:31:26.690 --> 07:31:26.700 align:start position:0%
petition is filed they're just a
 
07:31:29.208 --> 07:31:29.218 align:start position:0%
remarkable number of things that go into
 
07:31:31.968 --> 07:31:31.978 align:start position:0%
putting together that schedule and one
 
07:31:33.770 --> 07:31:33.780 align:start position:0%
of them is absolutely the right of
 
07:31:36.590 --> 07:31:36.600 align:start position:0%
speedy trial and that is a factor in
 
07:31:39.048 --> 07:31:39.058 align:start position:0%
terms of ensuring that a criminal case
 
07:31:41.330 --> 07:31:41.340 align:start position:0%
when it's filed meets those
 
07:31:43.490 --> 07:31:43.500 align:start position:0%
constitutional requirements of speedy
 
07:31:43.500 --> 07:31:45.590 align:start position:0%
constitutional requirements of speedy
trial

07:31:45.590 --> 07:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
trial
 
07:31:48.650 --> 07:31:48.660 align:start position:0%
when it in preparation for for today's
 
07:31:50.868 --> 07:31:50.878 align:start position:0%
hearing we did ask our judges you know
 
07:31:52.788 --> 07:31:52.798 align:start position:0%
when was the last time a speedy trial
 
07:31:55.930 --> 07:31:55.940 align:start position:0%
became sort of the driving force of of
 
07:31:58.730 --> 07:31:58.740 align:start position:0%
uh of a dismissal
 
07:31:58.740 --> 07:31:59.510 align:start position:0%
uh of a dismissal
um

07:31:59.510 --> 07:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:32:01.850 --> 07:32:01.860 align:start position:0%
almost none of them could re even recall
 
07:32:05.390 --> 07:32:05.400 align:start position:0%
it resulting in a dismissal there were a
 
07:32:07.190 --> 07:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
couple that that did
 
07:32:09.590 --> 07:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
um in in over the last 10 years but
 
07:32:11.868 --> 07:32:11.878 align:start position:0%
there were a couple but it is not
 
07:32:13.730 --> 07:32:13.740 align:start position:0%
something that and they all said that's
 
07:32:14.990 --> 07:32:15.000 align:start position:0%
something I would remember because it
 
07:32:17.030 --> 07:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
just doesn't happen
 
07:32:18.890 --> 07:32:18.900 align:start position:0%
um so the the
 
07:32:23.030 --> 07:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
by imposing a 90-day 180 day deadline is
 
07:32:26.448 --> 07:32:26.458 align:start position:0%
one more factor in terms of consuming
 
07:32:28.968 --> 07:32:28.978 align:start position:0%
what is an incredibly valuable resources
 
07:32:31.070 --> 07:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
resource not to meet now a
 
07:32:33.410 --> 07:32:33.420 align:start position:0%
constitutional deadline but to meet a
 
07:32:35.150 --> 07:32:35.160 align:start position:0%
statutory deadline and it said we have
 
07:32:37.430 --> 07:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
statutory deadlines this would not be a
 
07:32:39.350 --> 07:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
constitutional deadline this would be a
 
07:32:42.830 --> 07:32:42.840 align:start position:0%
a statutory deadline that we now have to
 
07:32:44.990 --> 07:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
work into that schedule
 
07:32:47.570 --> 07:32:47.580 align:start position:0%
anytime you take a resource which is
 
07:32:49.368 --> 07:32:49.378 align:start position:0%
that quartz docket and you put something
 
07:32:51.770 --> 07:32:51.780 align:start position:0%
on it that means something else is not
 
07:32:55.010 --> 07:32:55.020 align:start position:0%
going on it that means something a small
 
07:32:57.170 --> 07:32:57.180 align:start position:0%
claims case that is waiting for somebody
 
07:32:59.448 --> 07:32:59.458 align:start position:0%
to get in front of a judge is not going
 
07:33:01.190 --> 07:33:01.200 align:start position:0%
to be hurt that's one of the things we
 
07:33:03.230 --> 07:33:03.240 align:start position:0%
try to balance we want those cases to be
 
07:33:05.030 --> 07:33:05.040 align:start position:0%
heard and we want those to get in front
 
07:33:08.930 --> 07:33:08.940 align:start position:0%
of a judge the more things we have that
 
07:33:11.930 --> 07:33:11.940 align:start position:0%
are required by Statute
 
07:33:14.510 --> 07:33:14.520 align:start position:0%
the fewer the harder it is to get to
 
07:33:16.850 --> 07:33:16.860 align:start position:0%
those things that we simply do not have
 
07:33:20.150 --> 07:33:20.160 align:start position:0%
a deadline built into it and we try to
 
07:33:21.770 --> 07:33:21.780 align:start position:0%
have time available for those things
 
07:33:24.368 --> 07:33:24.378 align:start position:0%
that don't have a deadline built into it
 
07:33:27.048 --> 07:33:27.058 align:start position:0%
so I think this
 
07:33:30.770 --> 07:33:30.780 align:start position:0%
proposal while it may sound like okay
 
07:33:32.628 --> 07:33:32.638 align:start position:0%
this will speed things up it's a speedy
 
07:33:35.208 --> 07:33:35.218 align:start position:0%
trial thing the net result of having
 
07:33:37.610 --> 07:33:37.620 align:start position:0%
more and more core or statutory
 
07:33:39.708 --> 07:33:39.718 align:start position:0%
deadlines is to actually slow down the
 
07:33:42.590 --> 07:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
process it gives one less thing that the
 
07:33:44.270 --> 07:33:44.280 align:start position:0%
that the court can take into
 
07:33:46.070 --> 07:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
consideration when scheduling and
 
07:33:48.288 --> 07:33:48.298 align:start position:0%
figuring out what's going to be next on
 
07:33:50.270 --> 07:33:50.280 align:start position:0%
that docket at 10 o'clock on Tuesday
 
07:33:53.330 --> 07:33:53.340 align:start position:0%
morning it's it's just one more way of
 
07:33:55.670 --> 07:33:55.680 align:start position:0%
saying okay something else is simply not
 
07:33:58.368 --> 07:33:58.378 align:start position:0%
going to get reached Tuesday morning at
 
07:34:00.230 --> 07:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
nine o'clock
 
07:34:02.270 --> 07:34:02.280 align:start position:0%
um as you heard before we don't actually
 
07:34:04.548 --> 07:34:04.558 align:start position:0%
track the arrest date we can't track 90
 
07:34:06.110 --> 07:34:06.120 align:start position:0%
days from an arrest date we don't know
 
07:34:09.048 --> 07:34:09.058 align:start position:0%
it's not part of our system uh it's it's
 
07:34:11.510 --> 07:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
not it's not a way in which we track
 
07:34:15.288 --> 07:34:15.298 align:start position:0%
anything so taking 90 days for us to do
 
07:34:17.030 --> 07:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
something within 90 days of something we
 
07:34:21.048 --> 07:34:21.058 align:start position:0%
don't track is uh is very difficult
 
07:34:21.058 --> 07:34:22.250 align:start position:0%
don't track is uh is very difficult
um

07:34:22.250 --> 07:34:22.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:34:24.708 --> 07:34:24.718 align:start position:0%
the other aspect of this is we currently
 
07:34:27.590 --> 07:34:27.600 align:start position:0%
have as you all know a public defender
 
07:34:27.600 --> 07:34:28.730 align:start position:0%
have as you all know a public defender
shortage

07:34:28.730 --> 07:34:28.740 align:start position:0%
shortage
 
07:34:32.990 --> 07:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:34:35.990 --> 07:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
um appointed we say you're entitled to a
 
07:34:38.330 --> 07:34:38.340 align:start position:0%
public defender that's the easy part it
 
07:34:39.708 --> 07:34:39.718 align:start position:0%
then goes to the public defender's
 
07:34:42.468 --> 07:34:42.478 align:start position:0%
office and they also have an extremely
 
07:34:45.288 --> 07:34:45.298 align:start position:0%
full caseload for them to file an
 
07:34:47.930 --> 07:34:47.940 align:start position:0%
appearance in some places can be quite a
 
07:34:49.368 --> 07:34:49.378 align:start position:0%
while they're not filing at the day
 
07:34:49.378 --> 07:34:50.410 align:start position:0%
while they're not filing at the day
after

07:34:50.410 --> 07:34:50.420 align:start position:0%
after
 
07:34:54.708 --> 07:34:54.718 align:start position:0%
the court orders it so that factors into
 
07:34:56.510 --> 07:34:56.520 align:start position:0%
when is the case going to get scheduled
 
07:34:58.670 --> 07:34:58.680 align:start position:0%
when is the public defender filing the
 
07:35:00.830 --> 07:35:00.840 align:start position:0%
appearance in that case
 
07:35:03.650 --> 07:35:03.660 align:start position:0%
I'm going I'm not going to you all have
 
07:35:05.810 --> 07:35:05.820 align:start position:0%
tremendous stamina
 
07:35:05.820 --> 07:35:06.770 align:start position:0%
tremendous stamina
um

07:35:06.770 --> 07:35:06.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:35:10.190 --> 07:35:10.200 align:start position:0%
moving on to part two of the of the
 
07:35:11.750 --> 07:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
build which talks about the penalty
 
07:35:11.760 --> 07:35:13.310 align:start position:0%
build which talks about the penalty
assessment

07:35:13.310 --> 07:35:13.320 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
07:35:14.930 --> 07:35:14.940 align:start position:0%
um the first part of it talks about
 
07:35:16.548 --> 07:35:16.558 align:start position:0%
there would be a fifty dollar case on
 
07:35:19.190 --> 07:35:19.200 align:start position:0%
every k a fifty dollar chart penalty
 
07:35:20.810 --> 07:35:20.820 align:start position:0%
assessment on every case involving a
 
07:35:22.788 --> 07:35:22.798 align:start position:0%
charge for an alcohol or controlled drug
 
07:35:22.798 --> 07:35:24.170 align:start position:0%
charge for an alcohol or controlled drug
offense

07:35:24.170 --> 07:35:24.180 align:start position:0%
offense
 
07:35:27.288 --> 07:35:27.298 align:start position:0%
that's not the way we we don't have a
 
07:35:28.788 --> 07:35:28.798 align:start position:0%
list of everything that is a controlled
 
07:35:28.798 --> 07:35:30.048 align:start position:0%
list of everything that is a controlled
uh

07:35:30.048 --> 07:35:30.058 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:35:32.150 --> 07:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
drug offense or an alcohol offense it
 
07:35:36.650 --> 07:35:36.660 align:start position:0%
needs to reference a a chapter a section
 
07:35:39.770 --> 07:35:39.780 align:start position:0%
or a title of an RSA we we don't sort of
 
07:35:41.510 --> 07:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
have this this way of saying you know
 
07:35:42.890 --> 07:35:42.900 align:start position:0%
this would be a controlled drug offense
 
07:35:44.570 --> 07:35:44.580 align:start position:0%
some are obvious some of them are less
 
07:35:46.910 --> 07:35:46.920 align:start position:0%
obvious that doesn't tell us what
 
07:35:49.430 --> 07:35:49.440 align:start position:0%
statutory sections or chapters or titles
 
07:35:52.190 --> 07:35:52.200 align:start position:0%
are entitled to that new
 
07:35:54.770 --> 07:35:54.780 align:start position:0%
um penalty assessment the penalty
 
07:35:57.670 --> 07:35:57.680 align:start position:0%
assessment then says that it would be
 
07:35:59.690 --> 07:35:59.700 align:start position:0%
provided to the judicial branch
 
07:36:02.208 --> 07:36:02.218 align:start position:0%
Information Technology fund which is a
 
07:36:04.968 --> 07:36:04.978 align:start position:0%
fund that does exist and it does a
 
07:36:07.128 --> 07:36:07.138 align:start position:0%
percentage of penalty assessment does
 
07:36:11.810 --> 07:36:11.820 align:start position:0%
come into our I.T fund and then it says
 
07:36:14.628 --> 07:36:14.638 align:start position:0%
for use by the state crime lab we have
 
07:36:16.070 --> 07:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with the State Crime Lab
 
07:36:18.530 --> 07:36:18.540 align:start position:0%
it's an executive branch agency not a
 
07:36:20.448 --> 07:36:20.458 align:start position:0%
judicial branch agency we don't know
 
07:36:22.610 --> 07:36:22.620 align:start position:0%
what to do about that line it just
 
07:36:25.190 --> 07:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
simply doesn't make any sense in terms
 
07:36:27.770 --> 07:36:27.780 align:start position:0%
of the transmittal of money to something
 
07:36:30.128 --> 07:36:30.138 align:start position:0%
that we don't have any control over
 
07:36:33.650 --> 07:36:33.660 align:start position:0%
so in closing with regard to the sort of
 
07:36:35.690 --> 07:36:35.700 align:start position:0%
substance of of this
 
07:36:39.410 --> 07:36:39.420 align:start position:0%
to provide this new statutory deadline
 
07:36:45.230 --> 07:36:45.240 align:start position:0%
would have a a simply a huge impact on
 
07:36:47.690 --> 07:36:47.700 align:start position:0%
the Court's ability to to schedule and
 
07:36:50.390 --> 07:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
control its own docket and we do ask
 
07:36:53.208 --> 07:36:53.218 align:start position:0%
that that this um
 
07:36:56.990 --> 07:36:57.000 align:start position:0%
will be voted down itl thank you uh with
 
07:36:58.070 --> 07:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
that I'd be happy to answer any
 
07:37:02.810 --> 07:37:02.820 align:start position:0%
