speak

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:55.000 align:start position:0%
speak
 
00:07:59.710 --> 00:07:59.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to say um as a
 
00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:05.360 align:start position:0%
preliminary matter that it is unusual
 
00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:07.960 align:start position:0%
for people to come and testify in a work
 
00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:12.280 align:start position:0%
session so um this is this is not our
 
00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
normal practice so sure I
 
00:08:18.309 --> 00:08:18.319 align:start position:0%
understand good morning good morning can
 
00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
you push the button so that your
 
00:08:22.029 --> 00:08:22.039 align:start position:0%
microphone turns on good morning I'm
 
00:08:24.189 --> 00:08:24.199 align:start position:0%
Lindsay Taylor Jackson and I'm making a
 
00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:26.440 align:start position:0%
film following people with endometriosis
 
00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:28.120 align:start position:0%
and I'm here to tell my personal story
 
00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:29.670 align:start position:0%
and I'm here to tell my personal story
today

00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:29.680 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:08:31.749 --> 00:08:31.759 align:start position:0%
I once was a happy kid who had friends
 
00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:34.360 align:start position:0%
was athletic and loved going to school
 
00:08:36.829 --> 00:08:36.839 align:start position:0%
at 10 years old it all changed I began
 
00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
experiencing pain so intense it felt
 
00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:40.640 align:start position:0%
like a serrated knife was slicing and
 
00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:43.200 align:start position:0%
twisting through my abdomen for the next
 
00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:45.720 align:start position:0%
13 years despite endless tests and
 
00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
doctor's appointments I remained
 
00:08:50.389 --> 00:08:50.399 align:start position:0%
undiagnosed I had excessive absences
 
00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:53.640 align:start position:0%
from school at 23 I got my first surgery
 
00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:56.200 align:start position:0%
and diagnosis endometriosis and signs
 
00:08:58.990 --> 00:08:59.000 align:start position:0%
pointing to possible adenomiosis I began
 
00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:01.120 align:start position:0%
a medical journey of hell for the next
 
00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:03.880 align:start position:0%
several years I spent a majority of my
 
00:09:08.509 --> 00:09:08.519 align:start position:0%
20s into my 30s Bleeding Out 24/7 365
 
00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:09.640 align:start position:0%
days a
 
00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
year my extra large overnight pads soak
 
00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
through within an hour I needed to
 
00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:17.680 align:start position:0%
frequent ER visits to make sure nothing
 
00:09:20.389 --> 00:09:20.399 align:start position:0%
was rupturing each visit came with fears
 
00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:22.600 align:start position:0%
of would I need a blood transfusion
 
00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:25.160 align:start position:0%
could this be fatal multiple doctors
 
00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:27.560 align:start position:0%
shot me down for hysterectomy because of
 
00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:30.600 align:start position:0%
my age and being in childbearing years I
 
00:09:32.389 --> 00:09:32.399 align:start position:0%
was once told I've seen women change
 
00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:34.440 align:start position:0%
their minds you'll be depressed one day
 
00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:36.360 align:start position:0%
when you inevitably change your mind and
 
00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
want children how could doctors allow
 
00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:40.600 align:start position:0%
their personal opinions of procreation
 
00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:43.000 align:start position:0%
into their operating rooms I did what I
 
00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
could to survive I was a cinematographer
 
00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:47.360 align:start position:0%
on a film about women through hikers on
 
00:09:49.269 --> 00:09:49.279 align:start position:0%
the Appalachian Trail in
 
00:09:51.829 --> 00:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
2016 I was supposed to film the entire
 
00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:55.640 align:start position:0%
2,000m Trail but could only hike 630 M
 
00:09:57.870 --> 00:09:57.880 align:start position:0%
with 50 lbs on my back because I was
 
00:09:59.710 --> 00:09:59.720 align:start position:0%
bleeding out and blacking out from the
 
00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
pain and blood loss the entire time I
 
00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:05.200 align:start position:0%
left to go get another two surgeries the
 
00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:07.160 align:start position:0%
non-stop bleeding and excruciating pain
 
00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:09.640 align:start position:0%
caused me countless work opportunities
 
00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:12.360 align:start position:0%
and career advances over the years I got
 
00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:14.120 align:start position:0%
to a point where I couldn't even stand
 
00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:16.440 align:start position:0%
up most days I slept 20 hours a day and
 
00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:18.200 align:start position:0%
army crawled my way to the bathroom the
 
00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:20.120 align:start position:0%
pain was blinding the non-stop blood
 
00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
loss was dizzying and the Depression was
 
00:10:24.269 --> 00:10:24.279 align:start position:0%
severe in the years that followed I
 
00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
tried harsh medications medications I
 
00:10:28.269 --> 00:10:28.279 align:start position:0%
found out later were not actual
 
00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
treatments but were experimental
 
00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
Band-Aids that I fear were only aimed to
 
00:10:34.389 --> 00:10:34.399 align:start position:0%
preserve my uterus these medications
 
00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:37.200 align:start position:0%
have left permanent physical damage I
 
00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
never had a choice and was so desperate
 
00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:42.120 align:start position:0%
for any relief and was refus to
 
00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
hysterectomy time and time again I made
 
00:10:46.389 --> 00:10:46.399 align:start position:0%
it clear for every doctor that I have
 
00:10:48.629 --> 00:10:48.639 align:start position:0%
always known I do not want kids I've
 
00:10:50.949 --> 00:10:50.959 align:start position:0%
never wanted children physically I want
 
00:10:53.069 --> 00:10:53.079 align:start position:0%
any physically I wanted any disease out
 
00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
of my body and wanted to stop bleeding
 
00:10:58.030 --> 00:10:58.040 align:start position:0%
24/7 I tried drugs with intense side
 
00:10:59.870 --> 00:10:59.880 align:start position:0%
effects over almost a decade that
 
00:11:02.389 --> 00:11:02.399 align:start position:0%
depleted my finances I had to take out
 
00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
my entire 401K I also had to accept
 
00:11:08.269 --> 00:11:08.279 align:start position:0%
endless financial help from my parents I
 
00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:09.800 align:start position:0%
gave up my dreams of going to grad
 
00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
school as there was no way I could
 
00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:12.800 align:start position:0%
afford the future I had always
 
00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:14.720 align:start position:0%
envisioned when I was being forced to
 
00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:17.000 align:start position:0%
plan for a future I had never even
 
00:11:19.949 --> 00:11:19.959 align:start position:0%
wanted when I was 31 I found a surgeon
 
00:11:22.629 --> 00:11:22.639 align:start position:0%
who listened to my story she validated
 
00:11:24.269 --> 00:11:24.279 align:start position:0%
that none of my choices none of the
 
00:11:26.269 --> 00:11:26.279 align:start position:0%
choices Made For Me should have been
 
00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:28.680 align:start position:0%
anyone's but mine she gave me a total
 
00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
hysterctomy me and gave me my life and
 
00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:34.120 align:start position:0%
my dignity back these choices need to be
 
00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:36.720 align:start position:0%
more accessible I am in front of you as
 
00:11:39.069 --> 00:11:39.079 align:start position:0%

00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:40.720 align:start position:0%
our failing
 
00:11:43.509 --> 00:11:43.519 align:start position:0%
systems I am hopeful that by telling you

00:11:48.629 --> 00:11:48.639 align:start position:0%
understand what many of us have faced
 
00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
while deciding what your future laws
 
00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:52.880 align:start position:0%
dictate and when considering bills like
 
00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
this everyone should be able to Define
 
00:11:57.910 --> 00:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
what their own quality of life looks
 
00:12:01.829 --> 00:12:01.839 align:start position:0%

your call okay I it's just it's very
 
00:12:50.189 --> 00:12:50.199 align:start position:0%
unusual to have a repeat of a public
 
00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
hearing and if we are to do that for
 
00:12:54.629 --> 00:12:54.639 align:start position:0%
every bill that we have today that's
 
00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:56.360 align:start position:0%
going to make it a long no that is that
 
00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:00.600 align:start position:0%
is not my intent but but okay y
 
00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:03.160 align:start position:0%
please yeah hit the button so the red
 
00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
comes on all right thank you my name is
 
00:13:07.829 --> 00:13:07.839 align:start position:0%
Maggie K I was born and raised in New
 
00:13:11.189 --> 00:13:11.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I always knew I did not want
 
00:13:14.110 --> 00:13:14.120 align:start position:0%
children I suffered from endometriosis
 
00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:15.800 align:start position:0%
that started affecting my life as soon
 
00:13:18.189 --> 00:13:18.199 align:start position:0%
as I entered puberty I'm not sure if you
 
00:13:19.949 --> 00:13:19.959 align:start position:0%
folks are aware but at the time that I
 
00:13:21.829 --> 00:13:21.839 align:start position:0%
went to conquered high school they had a
 
00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:24.240 align:start position:0%
rule where if you miss 13 classes in a
 
00:13:26.069 --> 00:13:26.079 align:start position:0%
semester you can't you have to repeat
 
00:13:29.509 --> 00:13:29.519 align:start position:0%
that grade my grade averages were in the
 
00:13:32.269 --> 00:13:32.279 align:start position:0%
'90s but I missed more than 13 classes
 
00:13:34.069 --> 00:13:34.079 align:start position:0%
because my menstrual cycle would make me
 
00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:36.720 align:start position:0%
vomit uncontrollably for two or 3 days
 
00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:39.880 align:start position:0%
every single month the only solution I
 
00:13:43.949 --> 00:13:43.959 align:start position:0%
was offered was opiates and ibuprofen I
 
00:13:46.629 --> 00:13:46.639 align:start position:0%
was just told to take more Ibuprofen now
 
00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:49.120 align:start position:0%
at 51 I can't take ibuprofen because it
 
00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
wrecked my stomach I suffered for years
 
00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
I did end up getting my GED and I was
 
00:13:57.870 --> 00:13:57.880 align:start position:0%
able to complete College because of
 
00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:00.360 align:start position:0%
online classes that I could attend when
 
00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
I could attend them I went on to have a
 
00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
great career but I was styed in my
 
00:14:06.509 --> 00:14:06.519 align:start position:0%
career based on the fact that I had to
 
00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:08.720 align:start position:0%
miss work one or two days every single
 
00:14:11.189 --> 00:14:11.199 align:start position:0%
month unless my period fell on a weekend
 
00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:13.240 align:start position:0%
and it's not just pain that I could
 
00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:15.800 align:start position:0%
power through or take medication to
 
00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
solve I would vomit uncontrollably and
 
00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:21.240 align:start position:0%
you can't go to work if you're vomiting
 
00:14:24.069 --> 00:14:24.079 align:start position:0%
all day long this is a problem that
 
00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:26.120 align:start position:0%
women face all the time I was not
 
00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:28.040 align:start position:0%
offered any solutions maybe they didn't
 
00:14:30.389 --> 00:14:30.399 align:start position:0%
have good ones back then but they do
 
00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
today people can get hysterectomies we
 
00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:34.880 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be required to keep organs
 
00:14:36.749 --> 00:14:36.759 align:start position:0%
that are holding us back and destroying
 
00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:38.800 align:start position:0%
our lives just in case someday we want
 
00:14:41.629 --> 00:14:41.639 align:start position:0%
to have children I'm 51 years old I
 
00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:43.240 align:start position:0%
never had children because I didn't want
 
00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:45.160 align:start position:0%
children I've never regretted this I'm
 
00:14:47.749 --> 00:14:47.759 align:start position:0%
not sad or depressed I don't have kids
 
00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
I'm a little resentful that I was held
 
00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:52.680 align:start position:0%
back in my schooling and my career
 
00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:55.360 align:start position:0%
because I had a disease that would
 
00:14:57.710 --> 00:14:57.720 align:start position:0%
affect my fertility to treat and some
 
00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
future hypothetical
 
00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:03.680 align:start position:0%
man or child was more important than me
 
00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:07.320 align:start position:0%
who was living my life every single day
 
00:15:09.269 --> 00:15:09.279 align:start position:0%
so this is an issue that does need to be
 
00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:12.720 align:start position:0%
addressed regardless of what people
 
00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:15.160 align:start position:0%
think and that's all thank you thank you
 
00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:16.509 align:start position:0%
think and that's all thank you thank you
very

00:15:16.509 --> 00:15:16.519 align:start position:0%
very
 
00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:20.560 align:start position:0%
much okay um terms of in ter since we
 
00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
are on this bill we may as well continue
 
00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:25.360 align:start position:0%
to discuss it committee members any
 
00:15:28.269 --> 00:15:28.279 align:start position:0%
input you have on HB 1067 for the work
 
00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:29.720 align:start position:0%
session this morning
 
00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:32.120 align:start position:0%
representative Leon uh thank you Mr
 
00:15:35.509 --> 00:15:35.519 align:start position:0%
chairman um I think that the bill had
 
00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:37.240 align:start position:0%
was definitely narrowed down a lot from
 
00:15:39.069 --> 00:15:39.079 align:start position:0%
how it was initially introduced because
 
00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:41.720 align:start position:0%
the bill as we had it and we retained a
 
00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:45.440 align:start position:0%
study was to allow for um just a a
 
00:15:48.509 --> 00:15:48.519 align:start position:0%
choice um sterilization or hysterectomy
 
00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:50.360 align:start position:0%
and then also when there's a medical
 
00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
treatment and um it's just being denied
 
00:15:54.269 --> 00:15:54.279 align:start position:0%
a medical treatment is being denied
 
00:15:56.110 --> 00:15:56.120 align:start position:0%
because of the expectation of future
 
00:15:59.309 --> 00:15:59.319 align:start position:0%
wishes um I do think that looking
 
00:16:00.749 --> 00:16:00.759 align:start position:0%
forward it probably will be more
 
00:16:03.509 --> 00:16:03.519 align:start position:0%
convincing to people to Simply look at
 
00:16:05.629 --> 00:16:05.639 align:start position:0%
the when somebody is dealing with
 
00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:09.160 align:start position:0%
debilitating side effects and um not
 
00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
it's not the medical side that's being
 
00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:12.920 align:start position:0%
prioritized but potential future
 
00:16:14.949 --> 00:16:14.959 align:start position:0%
emotional May that may be a more
 
00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:16.480 align:start position:0%
effective way in order to make sure that
 
00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:19.000 align:start position:0%
people that women are not denied care um
 
00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
I do want to note as well that this bill
 
00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
was placed into the patients Bill of
 
00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
Rights we all thought that that would be
 
00:16:26.829 --> 00:16:26.839 align:start position:0%
a good position for that however we've
 
00:16:28.269 --> 00:16:28.279 align:start position:0%
come to learn that that deals with
 
00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:30.600 align:start position:0%
facilities and not for health care in
 
00:16:33.509 --> 00:16:33.519 align:start position:0%
general um so that that may be an issue
 
00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:36.360 align:start position:0%
for the future as well however um I do
 
00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
want to thank you for sharing your
 
00:16:40.069 --> 00:16:40.079 align:start position:0%
stories and I'm sorry that you had those
 
00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
stories that you need to share I wish uh
 
00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:43.880 align:start position:0%
you could have had treatment sooner so
 
00:16:47.189 --> 00:16:47.199 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative Leon
 
00:16:48.749 --> 00:16:48.759 align:start position:0%

the work the committee put into
 
00:17:01.069 --> 00:17:01.079 align:start position:0%
exploring the different things that we
 
00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
need to do to make this better and uh
 
00:17:05.789 --> 00:17:05.799 align:start position:0%
you know I hope that it will have a
 
00:17:07.669 --> 00:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
positive recommendation but either way
 
00:17:10.309 --> 00:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
the bill is uh coming back and looking
 
00:17:12.949 --> 00:17:12.959 align:start position:0%

I'm seeing done all right if there's no
 
00:17:27.909 --> 00:17:27.919 align:start position:0%
further comments from committee members
 
00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:30.280 align:start position:0%
let's go back to the top of the list to
 
00:17:33.789 --> 00:17:33.799 align:start position:0%
HB 554 FN representative Nagel you have
 
00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
done a lot of work on this you've
 
00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:37.480 align:start position:0%
chaired the subcommittee on this had
 
00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:39.000 align:start position:0%
some very productive meetings and thank
 
00:17:41.549 --> 00:17:41.559 align:start position:0%
you for your work and please share it
 
00:17:44.549 --> 00:17:44.559 align:start position:0%
with us thank you Mr chairman thanks for
 
00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:45.960 align:start position:0%
those kind words but I'm going to
 
00:17:47.909 --> 00:17:47.919 align:start position:0%
deflect them all to representative
 
00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:50.480 align:start position:0%
lungren who's brought up this bill in
 
00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
various for uh forms over the years so I
 
00:17:56.830 --> 00:17:56.840 align:start position:0%
think a lot of credit goes to him um
 
00:17:59.270 --> 00:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
just as a background the bill is there
 
00:18:01.789 --> 00:18:01.799 align:start position:0%
was an opioid crisis uh prescription
 
00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:04.600 align:start position:0%
drugs had something to do with that and
 
00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
that one of the reasons why there was an
 
00:18:09.909 --> 00:18:09.919 align:start position:0%
opioid crisis was because we failed to
 
00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
provide altern access to Alternative
 
00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
treatments um there's a long reason we
 
00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
need to go into great discussion about
 
00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
that but the whole point of this bill
 
00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:23.000 align:start position:0%
was to increase access to Alternative
 
00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:25.480 align:start position:0%
therapies um it's been presented at
 
00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:28.840 align:start position:0%
least four times um this bill kind of
 
00:18:32.149 --> 00:18:32.159 align:start position:0%
got merged into a bill that I wrote um
 
00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
um and it created kind of a major flaw
 
00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
that we really needed to fix and that's
 
00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:39.200 align:start position:0%
why we put this to interim study um we
 
00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:43.000 align:start position:0%
had two great meetings on this bill um
 
00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
and interestingly the the most important
 
00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:48.440 align:start position:0%
um presentation during the entire time I
 
00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:50.480 align:start position:0%
thought came from representative Murphy
 
00:18:53.549 --> 00:18:53.559 align:start position:0%
and representative Dolan separately um
 
00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:56.480 align:start position:0%
representative Dolan was representing um
 
00:18:58.990 --> 00:18:59.000 align:start position:0%
representative lungren initially and he
 
00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:01.360 align:start position:0%
just basically gave us a story and told
 
00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
us why this bill was important and that
 
00:19:05.669 --> 00:19:05.679 align:start position:0%
really kind of accelerated the value of
 
00:19:09.029 --> 00:19:09.039 align:start position:0%
what we were doing representative Murphy
 
00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
um when we had our first discussion we
 
00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:14.480 align:start position:0%
actually did this as a discussion um
 
00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:16.720 align:start position:0%
with stakeholders and and representative
 
00:19:18.549 --> 00:19:18.559 align:start position:0%
Murphy talked to them and asked them why
 
00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
not and and that also accelerated the
 
00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
discussion to make us feel why this was
 
00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:25.400 align:start position:0%
important to keep going so we ended up
 
00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:27.720 align:start position:0%
voting on it six to nothing we also
 
00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:30.440 align:start position:0%
actually did work to um six to nothing
 
00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
to proceed and um we actually started
 
00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
working on the bill the new bill as part
 
00:19:36.789 --> 00:19:36.799 align:start position:0%
of that process it was great to be part
 
00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:40.400 align:start position:0%
of this and thank you thank you I know
 
00:19:42.510 --> 00:19:42.520 align:start position:0%
some of the others here were on that
 
00:19:45.029 --> 00:19:45.039 align:start position:0%
subcommittee um I know representative we
 
00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:46.280 align:start position:0%
you were representative Murphy were you
 
00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
on the sub committee do we have you
 
00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:54.400 align:start position:0%
or um thank you I'm H I'm happy to speak
 
00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:56.960 align:start position:0%
on it and I I think that representative
 
00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:00.760 align:start position:0%
Nel did a great job of um shepherding uh
 
00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:03.440 align:start position:0%
cats through a somewhat difficult uh
 
00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
problem um I think we all recognized in
 
00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
the practice of medicine that there was
 
00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
an opioid crisis and uh we have made
 
00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:12.520 align:start position:0%
substantial steps in the last 20 years
 
00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
to uh improve upon that my my hesitation
 
00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:18.200 align:start position:0%
always has been to legislate you know
 
00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:20.480 align:start position:0%
the the practice of medicine having said
 
00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:25.240 align:start position:0%
that there are also uh many um um
 
00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:27.280 align:start position:0%
safeguards in place at the current time
 
00:20:29.669 --> 00:20:29.679 align:start position:0%
which deal with you know continue Med
 
00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:31.880 align:start position:0%
medical education board recertification
 
00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
Etc to maintain that people are aware of
 
00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:38.720 align:start position:0%
the opid crisis um but my also my other
 
00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:41.240 align:start position:0%
plea was to make sure that in this
 
00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:43.000 align:start position:0%
discussion that the insurance companies
 
00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:46.360 align:start position:0%
are keenly aware of and are involved in
 
00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
the um uh in the decisions that we make
 
00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:51.880 align:start position:0%
going forward so I I I think that there
 
00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:53.480 align:start position:0%
would be many things that were in the
 
00:20:55.310 --> 00:20:55.320 align:start position:0%
bill that were initially I thought
 
00:20:59.149 --> 00:20:59.159 align:start position:0%
should not be uh part of the the demands
 
00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:01.400 align:start position:0%
or the mandates for uh insurance
 
00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
companies or practitioners meaning
 
00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
things like making sure that you have
 
00:21:08.029 --> 00:21:08.039 align:start position:0%
enough practitioners and facilities in
 
00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:10.200 align:start position:0%
an area I mean that's almost impossible
 
00:21:12.789 --> 00:21:12.799 align:start position:0%
to do so some of that stuff will have to
 
00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:17.000 align:start position:0%
be um um vetted out um but having said
 
00:21:20.789 --> 00:21:20.799 align:start position:0%
that uh my two major concerns were and I
 
00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:22.640 align:start position:0%
won't be here in the next legislative
 
00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
session to um uh help Shepherd this
 
00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:26.840 align:start position:0%
through though I may be sitting on that
 
00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:28.600 align:start position:0%
side of the aisle uh when this bill
 
00:21:30.669 --> 00:21:30.679 align:start position:0%
comes forward I I think that it would be
 
00:21:32.789 --> 00:21:32.799 align:start position:0%
very important that we do not legislate
 
00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
the practice of medicine you know in any
 
00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:37.080 align:start position:0%
bill that we put forward but also that
 
00:21:38.789 --> 00:21:38.799 align:start position:0%
when we do so that all stakeholders
 
00:21:40.669 --> 00:21:40.679 align:start position:0%
including insurance carriers are part of
 
00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:42.760 align:start position:0%
the discussion and part of the solution
 
00:21:44.549 --> 00:21:44.559 align:start position:0%
going forward otherwise I think it's
 
00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:47.080 align:start position:0%
doomed to failure so I think that we we
 
00:21:51.630 --> 00:21:51.640 align:start position:0%
came across um uh we did a lot to um
 
00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
establish the fact that this bill should
 
00:21:55.870 --> 00:21:55.880 align:start position:0%
probably go forward but that it should
 
00:21:58.590 --> 00:21:58.600 align:start position:0%
be vetted in a way that makes sense for
 
00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
all the stakeholders involved thank you
 
00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:04.240 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Nal thanks you
 
00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:06.360 align:start position:0%
said all the greatest things and I just
 
00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:08.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to say that I was really honored
 
00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
with how many people were involved in
 
00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
this process um including the insurers
 
00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:14.720 align:start position:0%
who came to our meetings and that was
 
00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:17.080 align:start position:0%
wonderful and I also did want to say to
 
00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:18.600 align:start position:0%
the people in yellow that what we're
 
00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
talking about has some value for you too
 
00:22:22.549 --> 00:22:22.559 align:start position:0%
we hope because I've heard your story
 
00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
way too many times and it's very sad um
 
00:22:28.789 --> 00:22:28.799 align:start position:0%
but thanks thank you representative ever
 
00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:30.440 align:start position:0%
did you want to speak at all on this I
 
00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:33.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:35.080 align:start position:0%
subcommittee this may have been the
 
00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:36.520 align:start position:0%
subcommittee that I could never figure
 
00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
out whether I was on or not but I
 
00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:39.440 align:start position:0%
certainly agree with everything that's
 
00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
been said so far so I'll leave it there
 
00:22:44.789 --> 00:22:44.799 align:start position:0%
it's certainly an issue that needs to be
 
00:22:47.549 --> 00:22:47.559 align:start position:0%
uh looked at continuously going forward
 
00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:50.480 align:start position:0%
thank you anyone
 
00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:53.360 align:start position:0%
else okay seeing no one else uh with a
 
00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:55.880 align:start position:0%
comment on this um let's move on to HB
 
00:22:59.070 --> 00:22:59.080 align:start position:0%
580 FN I've been remiss announcing what
 
00:23:01.029 --> 00:23:01.039 align:start position:0%
the purpose of each bill
 
00:23:05.029 --> 00:23:05.039 align:start position:0%
was uh HB 580 FN EST is establishing a
 
00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
child's vision screening initiative
 
00:23:10.149 --> 00:23:10.159 align:start position:0%
within the State Medicaid Program any
 
00:23:12.669 --> 00:23:12.679 align:start position:0%
thoughts by committee members on
 
00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
this representative
 
00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
Weber I'm I'm thinking that maybe
 
00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro may have some
 
00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:21.320 align:start position:0%
thoughts on it as well but I I think
 
00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
it's I think it's a very
 
00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:25.880 align:start position:0%
worthwhile um initiative and I think we
 
00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
ought to explore it further and and time
 
00:23:34.029 --> 00:23:34.039 align:start position:0%
to come um because uh the issue of
 
00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:37.360 align:start position:0%
children's vision and appropriatly
 
00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:39.029 align:start position:0%
children's vision and appropriatly
intervention

00:23:39.029 --> 00:23:39.039 align:start position:0%
intervention
 
00:23:43.029 --> 00:23:43.039 align:start position:0%
is an important one so I would I would
 
00:23:45.029 --> 00:23:45.039 align:start position:0%
suggest we ought to recommend it for
 
00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
further legislation okay representative
 
00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
Shapiro I don't know if you're quite
 
00:23:51.549 --> 00:23:51.559 align:start position:0%
settled in yet but did you have any
 
00:23:55.789 --> 00:23:55.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:59.350 --> 00:23:59.360 align:start position:0%
bill okay
 
00:24:01.230 --> 00:24:01.240 align:start position:0%
okay well yeah it's 580 about the
 
00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:02.840 align:start position:0%
children's vision screening initiative
 
00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:04.640 align:start position:0%
but obviously we'll be addressing that
 
00:24:07.029 --> 00:24:07.039 align:start position:0%
further this afternoon in the executive
 
00:24:10.149 --> 00:24:10.159 align:start position:0%
session so if you want to speak
 
00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
then okay great anyone
 
00:24:17.149 --> 00:24:17.159 align:start position:0%
else moving on to HB 608 FN establishing
 
00:24:19.149 --> 00:24:19.159 align:start position:0%
a pilot program to support the Bureau of
 
00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
Developmental Services
 
00:24:23.590 --> 00:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
redesign um I had heard that there might
 
00:24:25.149 --> 00:24:25.159 align:start position:0%
be one or two people who wanted to speak
 
00:24:29.389 --> 00:24:29.399 align:start position:0%
to that I don't know if they still do
 
00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
um anyone in the
 
00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:35.960 align:start position:0%
audience seeing no one committee members
 
00:24:38.149 --> 00:24:38.159 align:start position:0%
thoughts representative
 
00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:41.440 align:start position:0%
Weber I'll just ask for my memory to be
 
00:24:44.669 --> 00:24:44.679 align:start position:0%
refreshed is this not something that's
 
00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:48.600 align:start position:0%
been um partially dealt with at least by
 
00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
the department going in a different
 
00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
direction for the design and therefore
 
00:24:57.710 --> 00:24:57.720 align:start position:0%
we've kind of moved on from where we
 
00:24:59.149 --> 00:24:59.159 align:start position:0%
were and I think one of the reasons that
 
00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
we were holding on to this was to see
 
00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
where they went with their new Direction
 
00:25:07.950 --> 00:25:07.960 align:start position:0%
but um it seems to me that for this one
 
00:25:10.149 --> 00:25:10.159 align:start position:0%
the time may have come and gone and
 
00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:12.640 align:start position:0%
there may be there may be new filings
 
00:25:16.750 --> 00:25:16.760 align:start position:0%
based on current progress but that this
 
00:25:19.669 --> 00:25:19.679 align:start position:0%
one perhaps is not there is a provision
 
00:25:22.389 --> 00:25:22.399 align:start position:0%
bill that has a deadline of June 30th
 
00:25:25.269 --> 00:25:25.279 align:start position:0%
2024 I did speak with uh the department
 
00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
on um associate commissioner sanon on
 
00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:31.240 align:start position:0%
Monday and the department has been
 
00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:34.200 align:start position:0%
addressing many of the aspects of this
 
00:25:36.269 --> 00:25:36.279 align:start position:0%
and they don't they don't think it's
 
00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:38.960 align:start position:0%
that's necessary at this point so so
 
00:25:41.950 --> 00:25:41.960 align:start position:0%
you're absolutely correct and and may I
 
00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:45.320 align:start position:0%
end sure uh my recollection is that this
 
00:25:48.190 --> 00:25:48.200 align:start position:0%
was one of a set of three or four
 
00:25:50.269 --> 00:25:50.279 align:start position:0%
different bills that were
 
00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:54.200 align:start position:0%
filed at a time when recipients of
 
00:25:56.990 --> 00:25:57.000 align:start position:0%
services and families were particularly
 
00:25:58.750 --> 00:25:58.760 align:start position:0%
distressed at the direct
 
00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:01.640 align:start position:0%
that might be going in service providers
 
00:26:04.110 --> 00:26:04.120 align:start position:0%
and so I I want to be sure that we
 
00:26:08.269 --> 00:26:08.279 align:start position:0%
acknowledge um that what we need to do
 
00:26:10.269 --> 00:26:10.279 align:start position:0%
going forward is a more collaborative
 
00:26:13.549 --> 00:26:13.559 align:start position:0%
effort but I think that I think that
 
00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
perhaps there a result of the filing of
 
00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:18.240 align:start position:0%
all of these bills that point was made
 
00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:20.720 align:start position:0%
loud and clear so thank you
 
00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:22.480 align:start position:0%
representative Lon uh thank you Mr
 
00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:24.320 align:start position:0%
chairman this bill was introduced at the
 
00:26:26.110 --> 00:26:26.120 align:start position:0%
beginning of the term in a time of great
 
00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:28.480 align:start position:0%
uncertainty regarding the redesign of
 
00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
the Bureau of Developmental Services um
 
00:26:32.029 --> 00:26:32.039 align:start position:0%
it was retained by the committee to
 
00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:33.640 align:start position:0%
continue the discussion which happened
 
00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
in the spring of um 2023 and the fall of
 
00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
2023 on this issue there was a lot of
 
00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:41.080 align:start position:0%
good discussion that did bring
 
00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:42.840 align:start position:0%
stakeholders together and had a chance
 
00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:44.640 align:start position:0%
to speak about this publicly and move
 
00:26:47.269 --> 00:26:47.279 align:start position:0%
towards a solution um with that we had
 
00:26:49.630 --> 00:26:49.640 align:start position:0%
recommended nrm study to keep this alive
 
00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:51.440 align:start position:0%
so that it could continue as a for if it
 
00:26:54.389 --> 00:26:54.399 align:start position:0%
was needed um now we've moved forward
 
00:26:56.350 --> 00:26:56.360 align:start position:0%
we've moved past that this has served
 
00:26:59.190 --> 00:26:59.200 align:start position:0%
its purpose and this bill is not needed
 
00:27:00.789 --> 00:27:00.799 align:start position:0%
for future legislation because it's
 
00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:02.960 align:start position:0%
already done its job um but I'm thankful
 
00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:04.600 align:start position:0%
for the committee to for keeping it an
 
00:27:06.310 --> 00:27:06.320 align:start position:0%
interim study because it did keep that
 
00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:08.389 align:start position:0%
interim study because it did keep that
Forum

00:27:08.389 --> 00:27:08.399 align:start position:0%
Forum
 
00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:11.640 align:start position:0%
alive anyone
 
00:27:14.110 --> 00:27:14.120 align:start position:0%
else representative Murphy thank you Mr
 
00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
chairman mine is mostly a question um as
 
00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
I wrote down in our notes on March 13th
 
00:27:21.070 --> 00:27:21.080 align:start position:0%
we actually
 
00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:24.760 align:start position:0%
um um voted with representative Lon you
 
00:27:26.870 --> 00:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
know um making the motion to retain the
 
00:27:28.990 --> 00:27:29.000 align:start position:0%
bill and this was to keep keep it quote
 
00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:31.360 align:start position:0%
as I wrote it down to keep it moving but
 
00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
to have HHS oversight uh potentially
 
00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:36.840 align:start position:0%
have a followup with a committee uh to
 
00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:40.240 align:start position:0%
evaluate and my question is most mostly
 
00:27:42.269 --> 00:27:42.279 align:start position:0%
or my comment is mostly a question as to
 
00:27:45.669 --> 00:27:45.679 align:start position:0%
where do we stand right now and will HHS
 
00:27:49.669 --> 00:27:49.679 align:start position:0%
oversight um um put forward a committee
 
00:27:52.149 --> 00:27:52.159 align:start position:0%
to recommend or look at this bill or
 
00:27:53.950 --> 00:27:53.960 align:start position:0%
this where do we stand with is what I'm
 
00:27:55.990 --> 00:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
stand asking representative Leon uh
 
00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mrman thank you for that
 
00:27:59.590 --> 00:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
question when we had put this together
 
00:28:01.149 --> 00:28:01.159 align:start position:0%
we were hoping that we'd be able to work
 
00:28:02.909 --> 00:28:02.919 align:start position:0%
on it as an interim study during the
 
00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:05.120 align:start position:0%
term however we had to wait until all
 
00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
the other bills were dealt with in order
 
00:28:09.789 --> 00:28:09.799 align:start position:0%
to meet as an interim study by that time
 
00:28:11.430 --> 00:28:11.440 align:start position:0%
um speaking with area agencies and
 
00:28:13.070 --> 00:28:13.080 align:start position:0%
speaking with others they felt that the
 
00:28:15.149 --> 00:28:15.159 align:start position:0%
process was moving along they had a good
 
00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:17.200 align:start position:0%
collaborative relationship um they do
 
00:28:18.430 --> 00:28:18.440 align:start position:0%
have to report to Health and Human
 
00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:20.320 align:start position:0%
Services oversight that's an ongoing
 
00:28:22.630 --> 00:28:22.640 align:start position:0%
issue but I don't think that it's at the
 
00:28:24.669 --> 00:28:24.679 align:start position:0%
level of needing a committee and I trust
 
00:28:26.029 --> 00:28:26.039 align:start position:0%
those on oversight to make that
 
00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:27.240 align:start position:0%
committee at this point if it's
 
00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:29.440 align:start position:0%
necessary thank
 
00:28:32.549 --> 00:28:32.559 align:start position:0%
you other comments or
 
00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:36.240 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none okay I'm moving on
 
00:28:39.070 --> 00:28:39.080 align:start position:0%
to hb1010 relative to expanding
 
00:28:42.269 --> 00:28:42.279 align:start position:0%
maternity options in Midwifery access
 
00:28:42.279 --> 00:28:44.269 align:start position:0%
maternity options in Midwifery access
any

00:28:44.269 --> 00:28:44.279 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:47.600 align:start position:0%
thoughts representative enal um thanks
 
00:28:51.149 --> 00:28:51.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:54.320 align:start position:0%
um one of the terms that I have learned
 
00:28:56.190 --> 00:28:56.200 align:start position:0%
in two years that I have never heard
 
00:28:59.350 --> 00:28:59.360 align:start position:0%
before was this concept of scope creep
 
00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
and it's viewed as a negative thing and
 
00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:03.960 align:start position:0%
in some circles and a positive thing in
 
00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:07.200 align:start position:0%
other circles as a middle child born on
 
00:29:09.149 --> 00:29:09.159 align:start position:0%
a Wednesday I kind of look at it from
 
00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:10.440 align:start position:0%
the middle I think in certain
 
00:29:12.509 --> 00:29:12.519 align:start position:0%
circumstances it can be a great thing
 
00:29:15.269 --> 00:29:15.279 align:start position:0%
and what that basically means is that
 
00:29:17.669 --> 00:29:17.679 align:start position:0%
different medical special or you know
 
00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:20.360 align:start position:0%
people decide to take more um
 
00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:22.720 align:start position:0%
responsibility within their a scop of
 
00:29:25.310 --> 00:29:25.320 align:start position:0%
practice um like for example I do
 
00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:28.200 align:start position:0%
epidural injections I've done 64,000 of
 
00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
them when I started that was not in my
 
00:29:32.269 --> 00:29:32.279 align:start position:0%
scope of practice that was an anesthesia
 
00:29:36.149 --> 00:29:36.159 align:start position:0%
thing but now I do it um this is one of
 
00:29:38.389 --> 00:29:38.399 align:start position:0%
those things we've had four bills in our
 
00:29:40.350 --> 00:29:40.360 align:start position:0%
session now where there was a scope of
 
00:29:42.909 --> 00:29:42.919 align:start position:0%
practice issue one was the Optometry
 
00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
Bill one was the physicians assistant
 
00:29:47.230 --> 00:29:47.240 align:start position:0%
Bill one was this bill and then there
 
00:29:50.509 --> 00:29:50.519 align:start position:0%
was a physical therapy bill um I have
 
00:29:52.669 --> 00:29:52.679 align:start position:0%
absolutely no problem with people asking
 
00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
for the right to do more if they do
 
00:29:57.470 --> 00:29:57.480 align:start position:0%
their due diligence to develop the skill
 
00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:00.240 align:start position:0%
level that they can to be able to do it
 
00:30:02.350 --> 00:30:02.360 align:start position:0%
for the physical therapist they did that
 
00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:04.480 align:start position:0%
for the other three they have not and
 
00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
when I presented this bill to people
 
00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
that work with midwives on a regular
 
00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:12.640 align:start position:0%
basis um I got a deer in the headlights
 
00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
look like no no no no they said they
 
00:30:17.789 --> 00:30:17.799 align:start position:0%
don't have the skill level to do this
 
00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that I'm very
 
00:30:21.310 --> 00:30:21.320 align:start position:0%
aware of having been involved in four
 
00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:23.640 align:start position:0%
obstetrical emergencies too with my own
 
00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
children is that things can go from bad
 
00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
to worse really fast and they said that
 
00:30:31.269 --> 00:30:31.279 align:start position:0%
whenever a midwife has to do a delivery
 
00:30:33.470 --> 00:30:33.480 align:start position:0%
on a child of the type that's specified
 
00:30:36.190 --> 00:30:36.200 align:start position:0%
in this bill that they have to make sure
 
00:30:38.029 --> 00:30:38.039 align:start position:0%
that they have extra resources available
 
00:30:40.190 --> 00:30:40.200 align:start position:0%
in the O whether the Midwife knows it or
 
00:30:41.870 --> 00:30:41.880 align:start position:0%
not they have to do that because they
 
00:30:43.269 --> 00:30:43.279 align:start position:0%
don't have the ability to deal with
 
00:30:45.870 --> 00:30:45.880 align:start position:0%
those emergencies and that's why I don't
 
00:30:47.870 --> 00:30:47.880 align:start position:0%
really I don't support this in any way
 
00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:51.240 align:start position:0%
shape or form um I don't know Midwifery
 
00:30:52.990 --> 00:30:53.000 align:start position:0%
well enough to know what kind of skill
 
00:30:54.909 --> 00:30:54.919 align:start position:0%
level they need to get to be able to do
 
00:30:57.190 --> 00:30:57.200 align:start position:0%
these things but in this group of
 
00:30:59.590 --> 00:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
patients specified in this bill I have a
 
00:31:01.710 --> 00:31:01.720 align:start position:0%
problem with that and so I won't be
 
00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:02.750 align:start position:0%
problem with that and so I won't be
supporting

00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
supporting
 
00:31:06.629 --> 00:31:06.639 align:start position:0%
it thank you representative
 
00:31:06.639 --> 00:31:09.430 align:start position:0%
it thank you representative
Shapiro

00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:09.440 align:start position:0%
Shapiro
 
00:31:12.669 --> 00:31:12.679 align:start position:0%
um yes having having been present at my
 
00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:16.240 align:start position:0%
daughter's um breach
 
00:31:19.269 --> 00:31:19.279 align:start position:0%
um vaginal birth um this is kind of
 
00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:21.720 align:start position:0%
close to my heart it was in a hospital
 
00:31:25.870 --> 00:31:25.880 align:start position:0%
with a doctor with Decades of experience
 
00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
um my main problem with this bill is
 
00:31:31.629 --> 00:31:31.639 align:start position:0%
that my understanding is it's the
 
00:31:31.639 --> 00:31:33.509 align:start position:0%
that my understanding is it's the
Midwifery

00:31:33.509 --> 00:31:33.519 align:start position:0%
Midwifery
 
00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:37.120 align:start position:0%
Council that is tasked with um
 
00:31:40.710 --> 00:31:40.720 align:start position:0%
overseeing the scope of practice for Lay
 
00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:44.760 align:start position:0%
midwives and then we're then we're
 
00:31:46.590 --> 00:31:46.600 align:start position:0%
proposing a bill that tells the
 
00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
Midwifery Council what they
 
00:31:51.470 --> 00:31:51.480 align:start position:0%
can what they can do and what they can't
 
00:31:53.389 --> 00:31:53.399 align:start position:0%
do when they are the ones that are
 
00:31:55.990 --> 00:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
tasked with
 
00:31:59.269 --> 00:31:59.279 align:start position:0%
um deciding on scope of practice so it
 
00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
seems contradictory to me um so I'm not
 
00:32:07.029 --> 00:32:07.039 align:start position:0%
in favor of of um moving this bill
 
00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:09.440 align:start position:0%
forward okay thank you representative
 
00:32:12.669 --> 00:32:12.679 align:start position:0%
Murphy thank you Mr chairman um I guess
 
00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
part of the um process this morning will
 
00:32:19.629 --> 00:32:19.639 align:start position:0%
be to um um restimulate some of our
 
00:32:21.029 --> 00:32:21.039 align:start position:0%
memories of what happened back in the
 
00:32:23.710 --> 00:32:23.720 align:start position:0%
springtime uh we looked at this bill and
 
00:32:26.430 --> 00:32:26.440 align:start position:0%
I specifically asked the Midwifery
 
00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:28.360 align:start position:0%
Council uh would they support the bill
 
00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:31.360 align:start position:0%
and they said absolutely not number two
 
00:32:33.909 --> 00:32:33.919 align:start position:0%
I also put in in again regarding the
 
00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
whole concept of practice scope creep
 
00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:39.200 align:start position:0%
etc etc I'm not sure I understand it
 
00:32:41.029 --> 00:32:41.039 align:start position:0%
fully but having said that and been a
 
00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
practitioner for many years if you were
 
00:32:47.470 --> 00:32:47.480 align:start position:0%
to change the Midwife title in the
 
00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:49.320 align:start position:0%
analysis section of this bill and just
 
00:32:51.430 --> 00:32:51.440 align:start position:0%
put it as there experienced physician
 
00:32:53.430 --> 00:32:53.440 align:start position:0%
with Decades of experience they would
 
00:32:56.389 --> 00:32:56.399 align:start position:0%
still not you know support the bill as
 
00:32:59.190 --> 00:32:59.200 align:start position:0%
written so for those reasons Al and
 
00:33:01.669 --> 00:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
because there's no experience you know
 
00:33:04.669 --> 00:33:04.679 align:start position:0%
OBGYN that will deliver a you know
 
00:33:07.990 --> 00:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
multiair you know um multiple fetuses
 
00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:11.200 align:start position:0%
within a uterus uh breach presentation
 
00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
30 miles away from home etc etc so um if
 
00:33:16.509 --> 00:33:16.519 align:start position:0%
you were to basically substitute the
 
00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:18.320 align:start position:0%
word Midwife and put experienced
 
00:33:20.350 --> 00:33:20.360 align:start position:0%
physician with Decades of experience
 
00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:22.440 align:start position:0%
they would still not vote for this bill
 
00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:24.360 align:start position:0%
so I would vote against it unless it's
 
00:33:26.830 --> 00:33:26.840 align:start position:0%
been changed substantially thank you
 
00:33:28.590 --> 00:33:28.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative King and then
 
00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
representative question for the chair um
 
00:33:33.909 --> 00:33:33.919 align:start position:0%
was this a bill that was actually worked
 
00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
on over the summer were there any
 
00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
subcommittee hearings on this or because
 
00:33:40.509 --> 00:33:40.519 align:start position:0%
so far it sounds like we've basically
 
00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
heard things objections that we would
 
00:33:44.389 --> 00:33:44.399 align:start position:0%
get during executive session and it
 
00:33:46.389 --> 00:33:46.399 align:start position:0%
would be nice I mean unfortunately
 
00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:47.880 align:start position:0%
representative kushman's not here I
 
00:33:49.750 --> 00:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
imagine she would have been on that
 
00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee I don't know I just would
 
00:33:53.389 --> 00:33:53.399 align:start position:0%
like a more work session out of this as
 
00:33:55.950 --> 00:33:55.960 align:start position:0%
opposed to just should and answer your
 
00:33:57.830 --> 00:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
question no that was not worked on over
 
00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
summer that uh we had done a number of
 
00:34:03.149 --> 00:34:03.159 align:start position:0%
surveys um our committee assistant had
 
00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:04.440 align:start position:0%
done a number of surveys and there
 
00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
wasn't the interest from committee
 
00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
members to work on it uh so nothing was
 
00:34:11.230 --> 00:34:11.240 align:start position:0%
done on it and um we do have to make a
 
00:34:14.149 --> 00:34:14.159 align:start position:0%
decision though ideally today in terms
 
00:34:16.990 --> 00:34:17.000 align:start position:0%
of recommending or not recommending but
 
00:34:18.470 --> 00:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
um to answer your question no nothing
 
00:34:20.669 --> 00:34:20.679 align:start position:0%
was done over the summer representative
 
00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
Glon uh thank you Mr chairman um
 
00:34:25.270 --> 00:34:25.280 align:start position:0%
representative sh here I'm so glad your
 
00:34:27.829 --> 00:34:27.839 align:start position:0%
daughter was able to have um have that
 
00:34:29.669 --> 00:34:29.679 align:start position:0%
type of delivery as opposed to being
 
00:34:32.149 --> 00:34:32.159 align:start position:0%
required to have a cesarian SE um
 
00:34:36.510 --> 00:34:36.520 align:start position:0%
section to deliver um her child in 2019
 
00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
when I was temporarily in the position
 
00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:40.720 align:start position:0%
of breach I was speaking to my hospital
 
00:34:43.389 --> 00:34:43.399 align:start position:0%
and the others available and because of
 
00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
legal concerns they no longer conducted
 
00:34:48.950 --> 00:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
they would only do a cesarian even when
 
00:34:51.389 --> 00:34:51.399 align:start position:0%
they had training because of legal
 
00:34:54.790 --> 00:34:54.800 align:start position:0%
concerns uh because uh because the
 
00:34:56.669 --> 00:34:56.679 align:start position:0%
actuaries were too worried about the wh
 
00:34:59.150 --> 00:34:59.160 align:start position:0%
ifs you were not permitted to have a
 
00:35:01.109 --> 00:35:01.119 align:start position:0%
vaginal breach birth in New Hampshire in
 
00:35:02.470 --> 00:35:02.480 align:start position:0%
the hospitals at least the ones that I
 
00:35:03.910 --> 00:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
spoke to that were close enough to my
 
00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
home um with this you are leaving women
 
00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
the option of either consenting to the m
 
00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:11.440 align:start position:0%
the surgery maybe if they're already a
 
00:35:14.109 --> 00:35:14.119 align:start position:0%
tried and tested mother with a team
 
00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:15.720 align:start position:0%
that's comfortable of doing this you're
 
00:35:17.910 --> 00:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
denying her that opportunity or you're
 
00:35:20.109 --> 00:35:20.119 align:start position:0%
asking her to free birth and then show
 
00:35:21.990 --> 00:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
to the hospital if there's a consequence
 
00:35:23.310 --> 00:35:23.320 align:start position:0%
or to go out State because in
 
00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts this can be done um I know
 
00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:28.720 align:start position:0%
that the bill as written um um had some
 
00:35:31.069 --> 00:35:31.079 align:start position:0%
serious serious questions for a lot of
 
00:35:33.390 --> 00:35:33.400 align:start position:0%
people but I do think that we're not
 
00:35:35.430 --> 00:35:35.440 align:start position:0%
just talking about what we can have the
 
00:35:36.910 --> 00:35:36.920 align:start position:0%
practice of the past where you had
 
00:35:38.790 --> 00:35:38.800 align:start position:0%
doctors who were experienced in vaginal
 
00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
bre breach deliveries because those
 
00:35:43.710 --> 00:35:43.720 align:start position:0%
don't happen in hospitals anymore um
 
00:35:45.390 --> 00:35:45.400 align:start position:0%
we're now looking at the fact that those
 
00:35:48.349 --> 00:35:48.359 align:start position:0%
simply are cesarians if that is a
 
00:35:51.390 --> 00:35:51.400 align:start position:0%
presentation and
 
00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
um and I believe I believe in people
 
00:35:56.349 --> 00:35:56.359 align:start position:0%
being able to have more agency in their
 
00:35:58.950 --> 00:35:58.960 align:start position:0%
choices um so so I do think that we do
 
00:36:00.589 --> 00:36:00.599 align:start position:0%
need to have a discussion because you're
 
00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:02.720 align:start position:0%
not talking about women who are going to
 
00:36:04.190 --> 00:36:04.200 align:start position:0%
be going to the hospital you also have
 
00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:06.040 align:start position:0%
women who will be free birthing because
 
00:36:09.190 --> 00:36:09.200 align:start position:0%
they can't have an experienced attendant
 
00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
um so it's an issue that we need to talk
 
00:36:14.230 --> 00:36:14.240 align:start position:0%
about because of moms and babies and the
 
00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
fact that as we've had a more and more
 
00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:18.160 align:start position:0%
concentrated Health Care System there's
 
00:36:19.470 --> 00:36:19.480 align:start position:0%
a lot more a lot of times when the
 
00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:21.160 align:start position:0%
lawyer's in the room with the doctor
 
00:36:23.309 --> 00:36:23.319 align:start position:0%
it's not just the doctor and the patient
 
00:36:25.109 --> 00:36:25.119 align:start position:0%
um but I appreciate your concerns
 
00:36:27.670 --> 00:36:27.680 align:start position:0%
because there's a reason why we make
 
00:36:29.550 --> 00:36:29.560 align:start position:0%
sure we have such a robust system in the
 
00:36:31.510 --> 00:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
past we lost too many moms and babies
 
00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
we're trying to minimize that but we
 
00:36:35.230 --> 00:36:35.240 align:start position:0%
need to acknowledge that nothing is
 
00:36:38.109 --> 00:36:38.119 align:start position:0%
riskless so thank you and and I I see
 
00:36:39.390 --> 00:36:39.400 align:start position:0%
the way that the things are going on
 
00:36:40.589 --> 00:36:40.599 align:start position:0%
this one but I did want to make the
 
00:36:42.550 --> 00:36:42.560 align:start position:0%
point that without permitting that
 
00:36:44.190 --> 00:36:44.200 align:start position:0%
you're asking a woman to go out of state
 
00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
unless she wants to consent to surgery
 
00:36:48.109 --> 00:36:48.119 align:start position:0%
to deliver her her
 
00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:50.440 align:start position:0%
child uh representative Nagel and then
 
00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:52.480 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro this is more a
 
00:36:54.750 --> 00:36:54.760 align:start position:0%
question for those way more experienced
 
00:36:57.109 --> 00:36:57.119 align:start position:0%
than I am on on what we're doing today
 
00:36:57.119 --> 00:36:58.109 align:start position:0%
than I am on on what we're doing today
but

00:36:58.109 --> 00:36:58.119 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:36:59.750 --> 00:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
I don't think there's a bill here that
 
00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:01.480 align:start position:0%
we're looking at that doesn't have some
 
00:37:03.470 --> 00:37:03.480 align:start position:0%
amount of Merit that could probably be
 
00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:05.680 align:start position:0%
made better that we could probably do
 
00:37:07.790 --> 00:37:07.800 align:start position:0%
better with study or whatever recommend
 
00:37:10.270 --> 00:37:10.280 align:start position:0%
something in the
 
00:37:12.390 --> 00:37:12.400 align:start position:0%
future I'm trying to understand what
 
00:37:14.109 --> 00:37:14.119 align:start position:0%
we're trying to accomplish here
 
00:37:14.119 --> 00:37:15.710 align:start position:0%
we're trying to accomplish here
representative

00:37:15.710 --> 00:37:15.720 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:37:18.349 --> 00:37:18.359 align:start position:0%
Weber well traditionally the responses
 
00:37:20.470 --> 00:37:20.480 align:start position:0%
have been all over the lot to interim
 
00:37:22.589 --> 00:37:22.599 align:start position:0%
study because we interim study bills for
 
00:37:24.190 --> 00:37:24.200 align:start position:0%
a whole bunch of different reasons and
 
00:37:28.109 --> 00:37:28.119 align:start position:0%
it sounds to me like we have one I mean
 
00:37:29.710 --> 00:37:29.720 align:start position:0%
sometimes we keep them to see what's
 
00:37:31.270 --> 00:37:31.280 align:start position:0%
going to happen we think there's been a
 
00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
resolution to a problem we're not sure
 
00:37:36.430 --> 00:37:36.440 align:start position:0%
that the resolution's going to work we
 
00:37:40.109 --> 00:37:40.119 align:start position:0%
keep them around to work on you know and
 
00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:42.880 align:start position:0%
see if in in case we need them that's
 
00:37:44.670 --> 00:37:44.680 align:start position:0%
one and we've already had one where it
 
00:37:46.670 --> 00:37:46.680 align:start position:0%
sounded like our discussion was handing
 
00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
in that direction today it's clearly a
 
00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:51.720 align:start position:0%
bill whose time has come and gone there
 
00:37:54.270 --> 00:37:54.280 align:start position:0%
are other things where I think
 
00:37:56.270 --> 00:37:56.280 align:start position:0%
reasonable parties disagree as to what
 
00:37:58.589 --> 00:37:58.599 align:start position:0%
our mission is
 
00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
because uh this is
 
00:38:04.510 --> 00:38:04.520 align:start position:0%
not a time for us to come up with an
 
00:38:07.589 --> 00:38:07.599 align:start position:0%
actual bill going forward that can only
 
00:38:09.390 --> 00:38:09.400 align:start position:0%
be done by the next
 
00:38:12.510 --> 00:38:12.520 align:start position:0%
legislature and so it's really giving
 
00:38:15.670 --> 00:38:15.680 align:start position:0%
our sense as to how far we've gotten in
 
00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:18.720 align:start position:0%
a discussion of what what might come up
 
00:38:21.230 --> 00:38:21.240 align:start position:0%
and I know there's a bill coming up F NE
 
00:38:22.829 --> 00:38:22.839 align:start position:0%
at some point where there has been
 
00:38:25.069 --> 00:38:25.079 align:start position:0%
significant more discussion and and we
 
00:38:28.109 --> 00:38:28.119 align:start position:0%
can talk about that an actual PR on word
 
00:38:29.870 --> 00:38:29.880 align:start position:0%
smithing but again that has to happen
 
00:38:33.910 --> 00:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
next time so in in many ways it's a
 
00:38:36.589 --> 00:38:36.599 align:start position:0%
matter of word smithing a report I mean
 
00:38:38.829 --> 00:38:38.839 align:start position:0%
I have actually written a
 
00:38:38.839 --> 00:38:40.430 align:start position:0%
I have actually written a
report

00:38:40.430 --> 00:38:40.440 align:start position:0%
report
 
00:38:46.270 --> 00:38:46.280 align:start position:0%
um that uh says that um everybody on the
 
00:38:48.270 --> 00:38:48.280 align:start position:0%
committee agreed that further action was
 
00:38:51.230 --> 00:38:51.240 align:start position:0%
needed we were completely opposed as to
 
00:38:54.109 --> 00:38:54.119 align:start position:0%
what that action should be and I wrote
 
00:38:57.030 --> 00:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
the two opposing positions so uh you
 
00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:00.400 align:start position:0%
come out all kinds of different ways um
 
00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
and and certainly no matter what the
 
00:39:06.069 --> 00:39:06.079 align:start position:0%
vote is I would assume that there is
 
00:39:07.870 --> 00:39:07.880 align:start position:0%
more than room in the writing of the
 
00:39:11.309 --> 00:39:11.319 align:start position:0%
report to acknowledge an underlying
 
00:39:15.069 --> 00:39:15.079 align:start position:0%
problem uh and you know what what we
 
00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
think ought to be done with it is only
 
00:39:18.510 --> 00:39:18.520 align:start position:0%
interesting because it's for the next
 
00:39:20.990 --> 00:39:21.000 align:start position:0%
legislature to
 
00:39:24.750 --> 00:39:24.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
Shapiro I actually have a lot of mixed
 
00:39:28.750 --> 00:39:28.760 align:start position:0%
feelings of about this bill because I do
 
00:39:32.510 --> 00:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
feel like um patients should have choice
 
00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:34.910 align:start position:0%
feel like um patients should have choice
and

00:39:34.910 --> 00:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:39:39.550 --> 00:39:39.560 align:start position:0%
um and you know including taking more
 
00:39:42.950 --> 00:39:42.960 align:start position:0%
risks um because it's something that's
 
00:39:47.550 --> 00:39:47.560 align:start position:0%
really important to them um and
 
00:39:50.670 --> 00:39:50.680 align:start position:0%
um I don't necessarily think we should
 
00:39:54.870 --> 00:39:54.880 align:start position:0%
give the right of providers to to to um
 
00:39:58.270 --> 00:39:58.280 align:start position:0%
proide services that they're not
 
00:40:00.750 --> 00:40:00.760 align:start position:0%
that is overly risky so I I have mixed
 
00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:03.240 align:start position:0%
feelings about it I'm I'm going to rely
 
00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
on representative Murphy who seems to
 
00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
take notes and actually can find his
 
00:40:09.790 --> 00:40:09.800 align:start position:0%
notes about these things but my memory
 
00:40:11.990 --> 00:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:40:15.230 --> 00:40:15.240 align:start position:0%
when and this is not to contradict you
 
00:40:17.630 --> 00:40:17.640 align:start position:0%
representative Leon but my memory is
 
00:40:20.510 --> 00:40:20.520 align:start position:0%
that when we had this discussion we had
 
00:40:23.190 --> 00:40:23.200 align:start position:0%
this hearing and when um medical
 
00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:24.829 align:start position:0%
this hearing and when um medical
providers

00:40:24.829 --> 00:40:24.839 align:start position:0%
providers
 
00:40:28.190 --> 00:40:28.200 align:start position:0%
testified that that they said that there
 
00:40:32.349 --> 00:40:32.359 align:start position:0%
it was possible to get a um a vaginal
 
00:40:35.829 --> 00:40:35.839 align:start position:0%
breach um delivery in New Hampshire now
 
00:40:39.829 --> 00:40:39.839 align:start position:0%
it might not be it might not be at every
 
00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
hospital and it might not be um you know
 
00:40:45.550 --> 00:40:45.560 align:start position:0%
there might be problems with that that
 
00:40:47.270 --> 00:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
the like the doctor who actually does
 
00:40:49.710 --> 00:40:49.720 align:start position:0%
that might not might be on vacation or
 
00:40:52.870 --> 00:40:52.880 align:start position:0%
something but that it wasn't impossible
 
00:40:56.230 --> 00:40:56.240 align:start position:0%
but anyway I I just that's just a memory
 
00:40:58.069 --> 00:40:58.079 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:41:02.190 --> 00:41:02.200 align:start position:0%
that I had that I wanted to bring
 
00:41:05.670 --> 00:41:05.680 align:start position:0%
forth representative papich Mueller
 
00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
again as a late Comer and a one day
 
00:41:10.109 --> 00:41:10.119 align:start position:0%
visitor all I want to say is that I
 
00:41:12.069 --> 00:41:12.079 align:start position:0%
appreciate learning about what was done
 
00:41:15.270 --> 00:41:15.280 align:start position:0%
earlier but I would not consider it
 
00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:18.560 align:start position:0%
wasn't impossible to be reasonable an
 
00:41:21.270 --> 00:41:21.280 align:start position:0%
reasonable option for patients it if if
 
00:41:22.790 --> 00:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
we give them options they have to be
 
00:41:25.829 --> 00:41:25.839 align:start position:0%
options that are reasonably feasible not
 
00:41:27.750 --> 00:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
you know if you jump through 15 Hoops
 
00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
maybe you'll get lucky and get that I
 
00:41:31.470 --> 00:41:31.480 align:start position:0%
know that's not what you meant but when
 
00:41:33.150 --> 00:41:33.160 align:start position:0%
you talk about standards right what is
 
00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
the standard that we use that's very
 
00:41:36.829 --> 00:41:36.839 align:start position:0%
important discussion and I would think
 
00:41:39.910 --> 00:41:39.920 align:start position:0%
we need something better than it's not
 
00:41:41.950 --> 00:41:41.960 align:start position:0%
completely impossible that's all thank
 
00:41:43.750 --> 00:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
you and I know that was not your intent
 
00:41:45.990 --> 00:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
to go there but representative Leon and
 
00:41:47.829 --> 00:41:47.839 align:start position:0%
then representative Murphy um thank you
 
00:41:49.829 --> 00:41:49.839 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman one of the things that we do
 
00:41:53.190 --> 00:41:53.200 align:start position:0%
is we um try not to confront Witnesses
 
00:41:56.670 --> 00:41:56.680 align:start position:0%
or necessarily ask questions that aren't
 
00:41:59.390 --> 00:41:59.400 align:start position:0%
getting us to a solution and simply or
 
00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
to try and F it out what's going on uh
 
00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:04.240 align:start position:0%
the I believe that the provider who said
 
00:42:06.270 --> 00:42:06.280 align:start position:0%
that they happen at their hospital was
 
00:42:08.270 --> 00:42:08.280 align:start position:0%
at the same hospital where I was denied
 
00:42:10.950 --> 00:42:10.960 align:start position:0%
that option so it it's one of those
 
00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:12.720 align:start position:0%
areas where it's hard to say well I
 
00:42:15.550 --> 00:42:15.560 align:start position:0%
disagree because of facts and my facts
 
00:42:17.230 --> 00:42:17.240 align:start position:0%
contradict what somebody is coming to
 
00:42:19.750 --> 00:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
testify for us but in that scenario I
 
00:42:21.309 --> 00:42:21.319 align:start position:0%
believe that provider was at the same
 
00:42:23.710 --> 00:42:23.720 align:start position:0%
facility that told me that that was not
 
00:42:26.790 --> 00:42:26.800 align:start position:0%
an option so we're here trying to deal
 
00:42:28.430 --> 00:42:28.440 align:start position:0%
with people and information that we have
 
00:42:30.190 --> 00:42:30.200 align:start position:0%
and that's why it's a challenging job so
 
00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:32.960 align:start position:0%
but I appreciate that representative
 
00:42:35.589 --> 00:42:35.599 align:start position:0%
Murphy thank you um thank you Mr
 
00:42:37.710 --> 00:42:37.720 align:start position:0%
chairman uh it only in response to
 
00:42:40.150 --> 00:42:40.160 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro's question um we
 
00:42:42.430 --> 00:42:42.440 align:start position:0%
did have that conversation uh with the
 
00:42:45.510 --> 00:42:45.520 align:start position:0%
um uh practitioners and they also did
 
00:42:48.390 --> 00:42:48.400 align:start position:0%
say that there are multiple options
 
00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:52.480 align:start position:0%
available for having C or having vaginal
 
00:42:54.990 --> 00:42:55.000 align:start position:0%
deliveries with breach presentations in
 
00:42:57.790 --> 00:42:57.800 align:start position:0%
multipar uh multiple uh fetuses within
 
00:42:57.800 --> 00:42:58.750 align:start position:0%
multipar uh multiple uh fetuses within
the

00:42:58.750 --> 00:42:58.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:43:02.150 --> 00:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
uterus you know the um the idea that you
 
00:43:05.430 --> 00:43:05.440 align:start position:0%
know having a delivery is an emergency
 
00:43:08.270 --> 00:43:08.280 align:start position:0%
is is not true I mean often times it is
 
00:43:10.190 --> 00:43:10.200 align:start position:0%
and often times it comes without warning
 
00:43:11.549 --> 00:43:11.559 align:start position:0%
and you have to deal with it as you have
 
00:43:13.390 --> 00:43:13.400 align:start position:0%
to deal with it but the majority of the
 
00:43:15.430 --> 00:43:15.440 align:start position:0%
time people are have the option of where
 
00:43:18.190 --> 00:43:18.200 align:start position:0%
they can call up a hospital and say will
 
00:43:20.190 --> 00:43:20.200 align:start position:0%
so and so be able to deliver this I
 
00:43:21.910 --> 00:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
would love to have this vaginally and
 
00:43:23.190 --> 00:43:23.200 align:start position:0%
they'll say yes we have the experience
 
00:43:24.910 --> 00:43:24.920 align:start position:0%
to do that so yes the answer to your
 
00:43:27.510 --> 00:43:27.520 align:start position:0%
question was yes they um that there was
 
00:43:31.589 --> 00:43:31.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:33.349 --> 00:43:33.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire other comment uh
 
00:43:35.630 --> 00:43:35.640 align:start position:0%
representative King I have a question
 
00:43:38.069 --> 00:43:38.079 align:start position:0%
for everybody actually um I just reread
 
00:43:39.190 --> 00:43:39.200 align:start position:0%
the bill and I think I may have
 
00:43:41.790 --> 00:43:41.800 align:start position:0%
misunderstood it the when we first when
 
00:43:43.630 --> 00:43:43.640 align:start position:0%
it was first presented several months
 
00:43:46.870 --> 00:43:46.880 align:start position:0%
ago um and I don't know why may maybe my
 
00:43:48.910 --> 00:43:48.920 align:start position:0%
memory is fuzzy but my understanding was
 
00:43:51.710 --> 00:43:51.720 align:start position:0%
that the bill made sure that um women
 
00:43:54.190 --> 00:43:54.200 align:start position:0%
always have access or options to
 
00:43:57.870 --> 00:43:57.880 align:start position:0%
midwives um um but I'm I'm rereading it
 
00:44:00.630 --> 00:44:00.640 align:start position:0%
it almost sounds like um this would kind
 
00:44:03.069 --> 00:44:03.079 align:start position:0%
of force hospitals to allow midwives to
 
00:44:05.589 --> 00:44:05.599 align:start position:0%
work within the hospital system can
 
00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
somebody just explain to me in layman's
 
00:44:10.270 --> 00:44:10.280 align:start position:0%
terms what this bill
 
00:44:14.470 --> 00:44:14.480 align:start position:0%
does um representative L uh thank you Mr
 
00:44:17.109 --> 00:44:17.119 align:start position:0%
chairman uh this is around what the
 
00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
midwives are able to do um if they're
 
00:44:21.069 --> 00:44:21.079 align:start position:0%
required to deny care or if they're
 
00:44:23.030 --> 00:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
required to transfer care of a woman
 
00:44:25.589 --> 00:44:25.599 align:start position:0%
because her condition has gone beyond
 
00:44:27.589 --> 00:44:27.599 align:start position:0%
her beyond the scope
 
00:44:29.309 --> 00:44:29.319 align:start position:0%
um that's what it deals with it's not
 
00:44:31.349 --> 00:44:31.359 align:start position:0%
talking about needing to requiring the
 
00:44:32.990 --> 00:44:33.000 align:start position:0%
hospitals to permit them to come and
 
00:44:35.390 --> 00:44:35.400 align:start position:0%
practice it's simply about whether or
 
00:44:37.069 --> 00:44:37.079 align:start position:0%
not that that Midwife can continue to
 
00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
provide care for that woman okay thank
 
00:44:41.109 --> 00:44:41.119 align:start position:0%
you then my understanding was correct
 
00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
originally and which is why I support
 
00:44:47.230 --> 00:44:47.240 align:start position:0%
the bill um because to me it just seems
 
00:44:50.349 --> 00:44:50.359 align:start position:0%
weird that in this state you have the
 
00:44:54.390 --> 00:44:54.400 align:start position:0%
legal ability to terminate a pregnancy
 
00:44:57.030 --> 00:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
but you wouldn't have the ability to use
 
00:44:58.510 --> 00:44:58.520 align:start position:0%
use a midwife when you want to that
 
00:45:02.390 --> 00:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
seems highly incongruous thank you
 
00:45:03.829 --> 00:45:03.839 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel and then
 
00:45:05.950 --> 00:45:05.960 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro and again tell me
 
00:45:07.870 --> 00:45:07.880 align:start position:0%
if I'm wrong but to me this is totally a
 
00:45:09.950 --> 00:45:09.960 align:start position:0%
scope of practice bill that allows them
 
00:45:12.750 --> 00:45:12.760 align:start position:0%
to deliver certain types of deliveries
 
00:45:14.670 --> 00:45:14.680 align:start position:0%
and certain settings that they may or
 
00:45:17.430 --> 00:45:17.440 align:start position:0%
may not be qualified to do and setting
 
00:45:20.710 --> 00:45:20.720 align:start position:0%
them up for you know consequences for
 
00:45:24.430 --> 00:45:24.440 align:start position:0%
that and that in the end we all pay for
 
00:45:27.190 --> 00:45:27.200 align:start position:0%
um so that's the way I read this bill is
 
00:45:31.349 --> 00:45:31.359 align:start position:0%
a scope of practice Bill representative
 
00:45:35.430 --> 00:45:35.440 align:start position:0%
chapero I'm glad to be corrected but
 
00:45:37.829 --> 00:45:37.839 align:start position:0%
um if I'm not
 
00:45:41.109 --> 00:45:41.119 align:start position:0%
mistaken there are there are two levels
 
00:45:44.030 --> 00:45:44.040 align:start position:0%
of Midwifery certification one is a
 
00:45:47.790 --> 00:45:47.800 align:start position:0%
nurse Midwife who may have
 
00:45:52.349 --> 00:45:52.359 align:start position:0%
um who may have the um ability to to
 
00:45:54.069 --> 00:45:54.079 align:start position:0%
practice in a hospital and deliver
 
00:45:57.549 --> 00:45:57.559 align:start position:0%
babies in a hospital the the the the
 
00:45:59.309 --> 00:45:59.319 align:start position:0%
certification of midwives that we're
 
00:46:01.910 --> 00:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
talking about and I I know they're not
 
00:46:03.870 --> 00:46:03.880 align:start position:0%
referred to as lay midwives but I don't
 
00:46:05.870 --> 00:46:05.880 align:start position:0%
know the proper um
 
00:46:09.589 --> 00:46:09.599 align:start position:0%
terminology um but we're talking about
 
00:46:11.030 --> 00:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
people who
 
00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:14.240 align:start position:0%
would generally or only be delivering
 
00:46:18.430 --> 00:46:18.440 align:start position:0%
babies um outside of hospitals I I
 
00:46:21.510 --> 00:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
believe representative Lon uh yes the
 
00:46:23.390 --> 00:46:23.400 align:start position:0%
certified nurse midwives are the ones
 
00:46:25.470 --> 00:46:25.480 align:start position:0%
that practice in the hospitals um those
 
00:46:28.230 --> 00:46:28.240 align:start position:0%
are the ones where they're on staff in
 
00:46:30.790 --> 00:46:30.800 align:start position:0%
some of our hospitals the certified
 
00:46:33.230 --> 00:46:33.240 align:start position:0%
midwives is the title we have for it
 
00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire you have different
 
00:46:37.349 --> 00:46:37.359 align:start position:0%
degree requirements and they're the ones
 
00:46:38.829 --> 00:46:38.839 align:start position:0%
who are helping women all around the
 
00:46:40.630 --> 00:46:40.640 align:start position:0%
state especially as we're closing our
 
00:46:44.309 --> 00:46:44.319 align:start position:0%
obstru our our deliveries but they do
 
00:46:47.670 --> 00:46:47.680 align:start position:0%
not practice in hospitals is correct
 
00:46:49.990 --> 00:46:50.000 align:start position:0%
they do not practice in
 
00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:52.480 align:start position:0%
hospitals representative Murphy I I
 
00:46:55.030 --> 00:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
would just like to clarify again what I
 
00:46:57.510 --> 00:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
think is the rule that is
 
00:46:59.150 --> 00:46:59.160 align:start position:0%
written in the analysis here and is
 
00:47:01.910 --> 00:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
basically says a Midwifery Council which
 
00:47:04.309 --> 00:47:04.319 align:start position:0%
governs the you know the oversight you
 
00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:05.680 align:start position:0%
know just like the Board of Medicine or
 
00:47:09.390 --> 00:47:09.400 align:start position:0%
the you know uh generates um uh
 
00:47:12.349 --> 00:47:12.359 align:start position:0%
evaluations of our practices in general
 
00:47:14.309 --> 00:47:14.319 align:start position:0%
they it says a mid referee Council shall
 
00:47:16.950 --> 00:47:16.960 align:start position:0%
not adopt rules limiting care so what
 
00:47:18.910 --> 00:47:18.920 align:start position:0%
there really is is a scope of practice
 
00:47:20.990 --> 00:47:21.000 align:start position:0%
you know restriction basically saying
 
00:47:23.710 --> 00:47:23.720 align:start position:0%
that the mid wre Council will not be
 
00:47:26.870 --> 00:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
able to put into place rules that prot
 
00:47:28.549 --> 00:47:28.559 align:start position:0%
protect the fetus and the baby and the
 
00:47:30.549 --> 00:47:30.559 align:start position:0%
mother you know in certain circumstances
 
00:47:32.670 --> 00:47:32.680 align:start position:0%
that are listed here including you know
 
00:47:34.870 --> 00:47:34.880 align:start position:0%
presentation number of you know prior
 
00:47:37.270 --> 00:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
C-sections distance from a hospital Etc
 
00:47:40.870 --> 00:47:40.880 align:start position:0%
so it is a scope of practice you know um
 
00:47:44.030 --> 00:47:44.040 align:start position:0%
Bill representative King thank you for
 
00:47:45.870 --> 00:47:45.880 align:start position:0%
that clarification uh representative
 
00:47:48.030 --> 00:47:48.040 align:start position:0%
Murphy can you tell me who created the
 
00:47:52.309 --> 00:47:52.319 align:start position:0%
Midwifery Council um and and you know
 
00:47:54.589 --> 00:47:54.599 align:start position:0%
because if it was created by an act of
 
00:47:55.990 --> 00:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
legislation then ultimately The
 
00:47:57.950 --> 00:47:57.960 align:start position:0%
Authority still rests with us that's I
 
00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
just I don't
 
00:48:04.910 --> 00:48:04.920 align:start position:0%
know representative Murphy I do not know
 
00:48:10.190 --> 00:48:10.200 align:start position:0%
okay any other comments on um HB 106 uh
 
00:48:15.109 --> 00:48:15.119 align:start position:0%
HB 1010 I'm sorry um any other
 
00:48:19.750 --> 00:48:19.760 align:start position:0%
comments seeing none okay moving on um
 
00:48:23.829 --> 00:48:23.839 align:start position:0%
to HB 1347 relative to administration of
 
00:48:25.990 --> 00:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Refugee resettlement
 
00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:27.470 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Refugee resettlement
program

00:48:27.470 --> 00:48:27.480 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:48:36.349 --> 00:48:36.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:39.109 --> 00:48:39.119 align:start position:0%
that yes representative
 
00:48:43.710 --> 00:48:43.720 align:start position:0%
Weber um I I have to say frankly that I
 
00:48:46.309 --> 00:48:46.319 align:start position:0%
thought that this was u a very
 
00:48:49.750 --> 00:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
inadvisable bill when it was filed um
 
00:48:52.430 --> 00:48:52.440 align:start position:0%
and the provisions in it that said that
 
00:48:55.309 --> 00:48:55.319 align:start position:0%
until all of the social determinants of
 
00:48:58.870 --> 00:48:58.880 align:start position:0%
Health were satisfied for every single
 
00:49:02.470 --> 00:49:02.480 align:start position:0%
citizen um that we would
 
00:49:05.109 --> 00:49:05.119 align:start position:0%
not expend funds
 
00:49:07.190 --> 00:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
for um
 
00:49:10.230 --> 00:49:10.240 align:start position:0%
immigrants was particularly in advised
 
00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
and if I recall correctly the sponsor
 
00:49:16.430 --> 00:49:16.440 align:start position:0%
came to us and said that he had filed it
 
00:49:18.710 --> 00:49:18.720 align:start position:0%
in a moment where he perhaps was not
 
00:49:22.270 --> 00:49:22.280 align:start position:0%
paying quite as much attention to what
 
00:49:24.630 --> 00:49:24.640 align:start position:0%
um was in front of us or what was
 
00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:32.150 --> 00:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
as all of us have concerns about
 
00:49:34.030 --> 00:49:34.040 align:start position:0%
immigration and
 
00:49:38.349 --> 00:49:38.359 align:start position:0%
how we relate to the Immigrant community
 
00:49:41.109 --> 00:49:41.119 align:start position:0%
and that perhaps we ought to think about
 
00:49:44.109 --> 00:49:44.119 align:start position:0%
it some more um it seemed to me that
 
00:49:45.430 --> 00:49:45.440 align:start position:0%
this was a
 
00:49:48.150 --> 00:49:48.160 align:start position:0%
particularly inappropriate vehicle to do
 
00:49:52.190 --> 00:49:52.200 align:start position:0%
that thinking so I would suggest that it
 
00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
not be referred for further um
 
00:49:57.750 --> 00:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
legislation along these lines although I
 
00:50:01.990 --> 00:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
am quite certain that the issue is one
 
00:50:04.109 --> 00:50:04.119 align:start position:0%
the issue broadly is one that will come
 
00:50:07.190 --> 00:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
up regularly going forward but I thought
 
00:50:09.390 --> 00:50:09.400 align:start position:0%
I frankly thought that this as drafted
 
00:50:12.910 --> 00:50:12.920 align:start position:0%
which may I'm not attributing motive
 
00:50:16.750 --> 00:50:16.760 align:start position:0%
I but as drafted it seemed to me to be
 
00:50:19.150 --> 00:50:19.160 align:start position:0%
particularly mean-minded and I I take
 
00:50:22.789 --> 00:50:22.799 align:start position:0%
the sponsor at his word that it was not
 
00:50:25.069 --> 00:50:25.079 align:start position:0%
what he was intending representative
 
00:50:27.150 --> 00:50:27.160 align:start position:0%
Leon and then representative
 
00:50:29.150 --> 00:50:29.160 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman um within the
 
00:50:30.630 --> 00:50:30.640 align:start position:0%
language of the bill there was reference
 
00:50:32.349 --> 00:50:32.359 align:start position:0%
to wait list I think that a lot of this
 
00:50:33.990 --> 00:50:34.000 align:start position:0%
was looking at the number of people who
 
00:50:36.549 --> 00:50:36.559 align:start position:0%
have unmet needs um who were waiting for
 
00:50:38.069 --> 00:50:38.079 align:start position:0%
services that the state has said that
 
00:50:39.470 --> 00:50:39.480 align:start position:0%
they'll provide if they have the money
 
00:50:40.829 --> 00:50:40.839 align:start position:0%
so it was looking to take those State
 
00:50:43.230 --> 00:50:43.240 align:start position:0%
funds uh there's so many complex
 
00:50:44.990 --> 00:50:45.000 align:start position:0%
interactions between the federal funding
 
00:50:47.030 --> 00:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
agreements and state law that the bill
 
00:50:49.630 --> 00:50:49.640 align:start position:0%
is completely unworkable and even taking
 
00:50:51.670 --> 00:50:51.680 align:start position:0%
a seed of looking at dealing with the
 
00:50:54.270 --> 00:50:54.280 align:start position:0%
weight lists it's going to anything to
 
00:50:55.789 --> 00:50:55.799 align:start position:0%
deal with that would have to take such a
 
00:50:57.589 --> 00:50:57.599 align:start position:0%
different form that that I I would
 
00:50:59.109 --> 00:50:59.119 align:start position:0%
suggest that we not recommend this for
 
00:51:01.430 --> 00:51:01.440 align:start position:0%
future legislation representative
 
00:51:04.829 --> 00:51:04.839 align:start position:0%
Shapiro yes thank you Mr chairman as
 
00:51:08.829 --> 00:51:08.839 align:start position:0%
much as I personally would love to see
 
00:51:11.549 --> 00:51:11.559 align:start position:0%
um the legislature be involved in some
 
00:51:14.109 --> 00:51:14.119 align:start position:0%
kind of really broad fair-minded
 
00:51:15.630 --> 00:51:15.640 align:start position:0%
discussion about the effects of
 
00:51:18.150 --> 00:51:18.160 align:start position:0%
immigration in New Hampshire and the
 
00:51:22.430 --> 00:51:22.440 align:start position:0%
benefits and the problems
 
00:51:28.109 --> 00:51:28.119 align:start position:0%
um I I don't and and and um
 
00:51:30.910 --> 00:51:30.920 align:start position:0%
in my in my personal conversations with
 
00:51:36.910 --> 00:51:36.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:40.270 --> 00:51:40.280 align:start position:0%
that he also wanted to have maybe for
 
00:51:42.750 --> 00:51:42.760 align:start position:0%
different reasons than myself have a
 
00:51:45.030 --> 00:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
discussion about immigration because
 
00:51:48.630 --> 00:51:48.640 align:start position:0%
it's such a big issue in our country um
 
00:51:51.630 --> 00:51:51.640 align:start position:0%
and so I I would agree with um
 
00:51:53.950 --> 00:51:53.960 align:start position:0%
representative Weber that he had already
 
00:51:56.150 --> 00:51:56.160 align:start position:0%
rethought this particular bill when he
 
00:51:56.160 --> 00:51:57.430 align:start position:0%
rethought this particular bill when he
brought

00:51:57.430 --> 00:51:57.440 align:start position:0%
brought
 
00:52:00.150 --> 00:52:00.160 align:start position:0%
and um it was particularly flawed
 
00:52:04.589 --> 00:52:04.599 align:start position:0%
because um the the department of refugee
 
00:52:07.750 --> 00:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
resettlement within DHHS which is very
 
00:52:11.309 --> 00:52:11.319 align:start position:0%
small and um helps to coordinate with
 
00:52:13.309 --> 00:52:13.319 align:start position:0%
the with the private nonprofit
 
00:52:15.470 --> 00:52:15.480 align:start position:0%
resettlement agencies that work in New
 
00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um the department within the
 
00:52:19.870 --> 00:52:19.880 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:52:23.549 --> 00:52:23.559 align:start position:0%
is very small is completely is is I I
 
00:52:27.150 --> 00:52:27.160 align:start position:0%
believe one um staff member um and
 
00:52:29.549 --> 00:52:29.559 align:start position:0%
limited funds and it's completely
 
00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
federal funds so the bill was referring
 
00:52:35.990 --> 00:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
to State funds um and I
 
00:52:38.950 --> 00:52:38.960 align:start position:0%
think the sponsor realized that it
 
00:52:41.109 --> 00:52:41.119 align:start position:0%
wasn't really relevant and I would agree
 
00:52:43.789 --> 00:52:43.799 align:start position:0%
that it's not really relevant so if
 
00:52:45.789 --> 00:52:45.799 align:start position:0%
there's some kind of Bill on
 
00:52:49.510 --> 00:52:49.520 align:start position:0%
immigration um that comes forward next
 
00:52:52.230 --> 00:52:52.240 align:start position:0%
um session I I don't think it would
 
00:52:54.270 --> 00:52:54.280 align:start position:0%
really be related to this specific bill
 
00:52:56.190 --> 00:52:56.200 align:start position:0%
so I I would agree with um the other
 
00:52:58.870 --> 00:52:58.880 align:start position:0%
people who have spoke that it um we
 
00:53:02.150 --> 00:53:02.160 align:start position:0%
should not recommend it go forward thank
 
00:53:04.829 --> 00:53:04.839 align:start position:0%
you representative Murphy thank you Mr
 
00:53:08.109 --> 00:53:08.119 align:start position:0%
chairman I I couldn't agree more with uh
 
00:53:09.910 --> 00:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
representative Leon and representative
 
00:53:12.710 --> 00:53:12.720 align:start position:0%
Shapiro as well that having some bill
 
00:53:15.150 --> 00:53:15.160 align:start position:0%
regarding immigration would be great but
 
00:53:16.990 --> 00:53:17.000 align:start position:0%
this is not the bill nor the platform on
 
00:53:18.789 --> 00:53:18.799 align:start position:0%
which it should be established and I
 
00:53:21.390 --> 00:53:21.400 align:start position:0%
have the quote that was taken back in
 
00:53:23.870 --> 00:53:23.880 align:start position:0%
March um by representative Edwards I
 
00:53:26.270 --> 00:53:26.280 align:start position:0%
really don't like this bill I doubt we
 
00:53:28.990 --> 00:53:29.000 align:start position:0%
could ever amend this bill in any way in
 
00:53:32.670 --> 00:53:32.680 align:start position:0%
any acceptable manner so I think the the
 
00:53:34.549 --> 00:53:34.559 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor was one who basically felt
 
00:53:36.910 --> 00:53:36.920 align:start position:0%
the same way that even with amendments
 
00:53:38.430 --> 00:53:38.440 align:start position:0%
we were not going to make it a good
 
00:53:40.430 --> 00:53:40.440 align:start position:0%
enough Bill to address the issues of
 
00:53:42.750 --> 00:53:42.760 align:start position:0%
immigration that you speak of thank you
 
00:53:48.230 --> 00:53:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:51.870 --> 00:53:51.880 align:start position:0%
1347 I'm seeing none okay moving on to
 
00:53:56.109 --> 00:53:56.119 align:start position:0%
HB 1661 FN relative to immunization
 
00:53:57.870 --> 00:53:57.880 align:start position:0%
report rep in requirements any thoughts
 
00:53:57.880 --> 00:53:58.789 align:start position:0%
report rep in requirements any thoughts
on

00:53:58.789 --> 00:53:58.799 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:54:03.030 --> 00:54:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:05.789 --> 00:54:05.799 align:start position:0%
Shapiro yes thank you Mr chairman I see
 
00:54:12.470 --> 00:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
a number of problems with this um bill
 
00:54:18.030 --> 00:54:18.040 align:start position:0%
um as I understand it um this bill um
 
00:54:18.040 --> 00:54:20.309 align:start position:0%
um as I understand it um this bill um
would

00:54:20.309 --> 00:54:20.319 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:54:25.230 --> 00:54:25.240 align:start position:0%
require certificates of death who um you
 
00:54:27.349 --> 00:54:27.359 align:start position:0%
know which might be signed off on by a
 
00:54:29.190 --> 00:54:29.200 align:start position:0%
medical examiner but most likely would
 
00:54:31.030 --> 00:54:31.040 align:start position:0%
be signed off on a physician a
 
00:54:34.190 --> 00:54:34.200 align:start position:0%
hospitalist or uh you know a Family
 
00:54:36.670 --> 00:54:36.680 align:start position:0%
Doctor Who whoever is dealing with the
 
00:54:39.710 --> 00:54:39.720 align:start position:0%
person who's at the end of their life um
 
00:54:42.990 --> 00:54:43.000 align:start position:0%
it would add the requirement that um a
 
00:54:45.190 --> 00:54:45.200 align:start position:0%
history of vaccinations be included in
 
00:54:47.470 --> 00:54:47.480 align:start position:0%
that death certificate I just think that
 
00:54:49.069 --> 00:54:49.079 align:start position:0%
that is
 
00:54:52.630 --> 00:54:52.640 align:start position:0%
um Way Beyond the scope of what um the
 
00:54:54.750 --> 00:54:54.760 align:start position:0%
normal person who the normal physician
 
00:54:56.990 --> 00:54:57.000 align:start position:0%
who's signing off on these generally
 
00:55:00.030 --> 00:55:00.040 align:start position:0%
does and it would incre create an
 
00:55:03.349 --> 00:55:03.359 align:start position:0%
incredible burden of having to um go
 
00:55:05.109 --> 00:55:05.119 align:start position:0%
back in history and find all that
 
00:55:07.630 --> 00:55:07.640 align:start position:0%
information and write it so that's
 
00:55:10.870 --> 00:55:10.880 align:start position:0%
that's one problem I have with it um
 
00:55:14.230 --> 00:55:14.240 align:start position:0%
another problem is that it calls for
 
00:55:18.230 --> 00:55:18.240 align:start position:0%
DHHS to do quarterly reports um that
 
00:55:19.910 --> 00:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
aggregate all this
 
00:55:24.589 --> 00:55:24.599 align:start position:0%
information um and to try to find
 
00:55:28.589 --> 00:55:28.599 align:start position:0%
um connections between
 
00:55:31.390 --> 00:55:31.400 align:start position:0%
um between the history of
 
00:55:35.109 --> 00:55:35.119 align:start position:0%
vaccinations and um and those deaths so
 
00:55:38.670 --> 00:55:38.680 align:start position:0%
that is a I I don't believe the Bill
 
00:55:42.630 --> 00:55:42.640 align:start position:0%
calls for hiring more staff for DHHS or
 
00:55:45.430 --> 00:55:45.440 align:start position:0%
um money for maybe the technology that
 
00:55:48.789 --> 00:55:48.799 align:start position:0%
would be needed to do this um but that
 
00:55:51.710 --> 00:55:51.720 align:start position:0%
is also seems to me to be an incredibly
 
00:55:54.069 --> 00:55:54.079 align:start position:0%
um large requirement that we would be
 
00:55:55.069 --> 00:55:55.079 align:start position:0%
putting on
 
00:55:58.309 --> 00:55:58.319 align:start position:0%
DHHS the last um issue that I have with
 
00:56:00.829 --> 00:56:00.839 align:start position:0%
this bill is the last part of the bill
 
00:56:05.150 --> 00:56:05.160 align:start position:0%
which um um suggests a
 
00:56:08.230 --> 00:56:08.240 align:start position:0%
lottery to pick um four different
 
00:56:11.589 --> 00:56:11.599 align:start position:0%
Auditors to audit this information and I
 
00:56:14.309 --> 00:56:14.319 align:start position:0%
think um well in short I think that just
 
00:56:16.750 --> 00:56:16.760 align:start position:0%
opens us up for
 
00:56:20.750 --> 00:56:20.760 align:start position:0%
um you know breaches of confidentiality
 
00:56:24.990 --> 00:56:25.000 align:start position:0%
and it's um kind of goes against the um
 
00:56:27.349 --> 00:56:27.359 align:start position:0%
Trend in our state people really really
 
00:56:30.710 --> 00:56:30.720 align:start position:0%
want to protect privacy um so for all
 
00:56:33.029 --> 00:56:33.039 align:start position:0%
those reasons
 
00:56:37.029 --> 00:56:37.039 align:start position:0%
um I do not think this is a um good bill
 
00:56:38.990 --> 00:56:39.000 align:start position:0%
for us to pursue thank you
 
00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:40.430 align:start position:0%
for us to pursue thank you
representative

00:56:40.430 --> 00:56:40.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:56:43.829 --> 00:56:43.839 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you Mr chair and I I I won't
 
00:56:46.549 --> 00:56:46.559 align:start position:0%
reiterate all of what representative
 
00:56:49.190 --> 00:56:49.200 align:start position:0%
Shapiro said but I agree with all of it
 
00:56:52.270 --> 00:56:52.280 align:start position:0%
um the other couple of points that I
 
00:56:56.390 --> 00:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
thought of is that um when my husband
 
00:56:58.710 --> 00:56:58.720 align:start position:0%
died at home his hospice nurse did the
 
00:57:01.150 --> 00:57:01.160 align:start position:0%
certification so that's a whole another
 
00:57:04.710 --> 00:57:04.720 align:start position:0%
range of people who will have had no
 
00:57:08.710 --> 00:57:08.720 align:start position:0%
contact with the vaccination status uh
 
00:57:14.470 --> 00:57:14.480 align:start position:0%
of people in most cases at least um and
 
00:57:18.710 --> 00:57:18.720 align:start position:0%
the um other concern I had and I'm sorry
 
00:57:20.069 --> 00:57:20.079 align:start position:0%
I don't have the bill in front of me and
 
00:57:22.069 --> 00:57:22.079 align:start position:0%
I've managed to leave my laptop at home
 
00:57:24.910 --> 00:57:24.920 align:start position:0%
so I was going to whip it up and give
 
00:57:28.190 --> 00:57:28.200 align:start position:0%
you the site but uh there was language
 
00:57:30.190 --> 00:57:30.200 align:start position:0%
about those
 
00:57:34.750 --> 00:57:34.760 align:start position:0%
reports that had particularly squishy
 
00:57:37.670 --> 00:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
language about reporting as appropriate
 
00:57:41.069 --> 00:57:41.079 align:start position:0%
and as consistent with privacy and I am
 
00:57:43.029 --> 00:57:43.039 align:start position:0%
sure that in this room in our
 
00:57:45.069 --> 00:57:45.079 align:start position:0%
discussions among our committee members
 
00:57:49.190 --> 00:57:49.200 align:start position:0%
it's become very clear that my notion of
 
00:57:51.510 --> 00:57:51.520 align:start position:0%
personal privacy and my personal privacy
 
00:57:53.589 --> 00:57:53.599 align:start position:0%
is not the same as other members in this
 
00:57:55.910 --> 00:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
room and we should each get to Define
 
00:57:57.109 --> 00:57:57.119 align:start position:0%
that for
 
00:58:00.589 --> 00:58:00.599 align:start position:0%
ourselves um so I thought that language
 
00:58:03.549 --> 00:58:03.559 align:start position:0%
was squishy and unhelpful and provided
 
00:58:05.829 --> 00:58:05.839 align:start position:0%
very little guidance as to
 
00:58:09.309 --> 00:58:09.319 align:start position:0%
how sensitive stuff was going to be uh
 
00:58:16.029 --> 00:58:16.039 align:start position:0%
dealt with um also seems like the um
 
00:58:19.589 --> 00:58:19.599 align:start position:0%
um the folks who presented were able
 
00:58:23.470 --> 00:58:23.480 align:start position:0%
from Massachusetts data to match up
 
00:58:25.630 --> 00:58:25.640 align:start position:0%
information and names which seem to me
 
00:58:27.270 --> 00:58:27.280 align:start position:0%
to be particular particularly
 
00:58:29.990 --> 00:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
intrusive uh and then the final point
 
00:58:33.829 --> 00:58:33.839 align:start position:0%
that I would like to make is if we want
 
00:58:36.870 --> 00:58:36.880 align:start position:0%
usable data that's going to help us make
 
00:58:39.109 --> 00:58:39.119 align:start position:0%
determinations about
 
00:58:43.309 --> 00:58:43.319 align:start position:0%
outcomes here we have no control really
 
00:58:46.029 --> 00:58:46.039 align:start position:0%
about the quality of what's being
 
00:58:48.950 --> 00:58:48.960 align:start position:0%
reported because on the one hand we have
 
00:58:52.230 --> 00:58:52.240 align:start position:0%
people who have authorized the reporting
 
00:58:56.109 --> 00:58:56.119 align:start position:0%
to an optional registry we have people
 
00:59:00.630 --> 00:59:00.640 align:start position:0%
people who have uh exercised their right
 
00:59:04.150 --> 00:59:04.160 align:start position:0%
not to be included in a registry and we
 
00:59:06.069 --> 00:59:06.079 align:start position:0%
have people who have exercised their
 
00:59:08.109 --> 00:59:08.119 align:start position:0%
right not to take a
 
00:59:13.230 --> 00:59:13.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:17.349 --> 00:59:17.359 align:start position:0%
knowing who those people are and a and
 
00:59:20.630 --> 00:59:20.640 align:start position:0%
so that we can evaluate the outcomes
 
00:59:22.750 --> 00:59:22.760 align:start position:0%
appropriately because some of the people
 
00:59:24.549 --> 00:59:24.559 align:start position:0%
who have no reporting will have no
 
00:59:26.270 --> 00:59:26.280 align:start position:0%
reporting because they didn't get a
 
00:59:27.910 --> 00:59:27.920 align:start position:0%
vaccine and some will have no reporting
 
00:59:30.950 --> 00:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
because they didn't want to report and
 
00:59:35.870 --> 00:59:35.880 align:start position:0%
um that results in data that is not
 
00:59:39.589 --> 00:59:39.599 align:start position:0%
going to be particularly useful if we're
 
00:59:42.910 --> 00:59:42.920 align:start position:0%
looking at correlation which is really
 
00:59:44.670 --> 00:59:44.680 align:start position:0%
all we can look at we're not looking at
 
00:59:48.510 --> 00:59:48.520 align:start position:0%
causation here so thank you thank you uh
 
00:59:49.510 --> 00:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy and then
 
00:59:51.510 --> 00:59:51.520 align:start position:0%
representative Lon thank you Mr chairman
 
00:59:55.069 --> 00:59:55.079 align:start position:0%
um as I reviewed the bill once again I I
 
00:59:56.349 --> 00:59:56.359 align:start position:0%
I found that there were m multiple
 
00:59:58.670 --> 00:59:58.680 align:start position:0%
issues that concern me as well including
 
01:00:01.589 --> 01:00:01.599 align:start position:0%
the privacy issues but you know it goes
 
01:00:04.789 --> 01:00:04.799 align:start position:0%
beyond that in many ways it becomes a a
 
01:00:06.910 --> 01:00:06.920 align:start position:0%
burdensome U issue for many
 
01:00:08.670 --> 01:00:08.680 align:start position:0%
practitioners the list of people that
 
01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:09.589 align:start position:0%
practitioners the list of people that
can

01:00:09.589 --> 01:00:09.599 align:start position:0%
can
 
01:00:12.430 --> 01:00:12.440 align:start position:0%
actually um as representative Weber
 
01:00:14.470 --> 01:00:14.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned the list of people that can
 
01:00:17.589 --> 01:00:17.599 align:start position:0%
certify a death are are fairly long they
 
01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
have to be available to certify the
 
01:00:23.549 --> 01:00:23.559 align:start position:0%
death within 36 hours and in in doing so
 
01:00:25.029 --> 01:00:25.039 align:start position:0%
they also have to have the computer
 
01:00:26.950 --> 01:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
information on which to look up the
 
01:00:28.789 --> 01:00:28.799 align:start position:0%
database and then assess whether or not
 
01:00:31.029 --> 01:00:31.039 align:start position:0%
the patient had an immunization my other
 
01:00:33.750 --> 01:00:33.760 align:start position:0%
concern is that why immunization why not
 
01:00:36.029 --> 01:00:36.039 align:start position:0%
you know do we not look at things like
 
01:00:37.750 --> 01:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
do they have a total joint in place do
 
01:00:40.549 --> 01:00:40.559 align:start position:0%
they have a um what were the medication
 
01:00:42.109 --> 01:00:42.119 align:start position:0%
list you know so the list can go on and
 
01:00:44.069 --> 01:00:44.079 align:start position:0%
on and on but the death certificate
 
01:00:45.910 --> 01:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
should simply state that the patient
 
01:00:48.190 --> 01:00:48.200 align:start position:0%
died in the day patient died this date
 
01:00:49.710 --> 01:00:49.720 align:start position:0%
and the patient died because of this
 
01:00:52.150 --> 01:00:52.160 align:start position:0%
reason you want to try to keep it as
 
01:00:54.230 --> 01:00:54.240 align:start position:0%
simple as possible the kiss principle in
 
01:00:56.270 --> 01:00:56.280 align:start position:0%
medicine has held up for many decades
 
01:00:57.549 --> 01:00:57.559 align:start position:0%
and I would try to do the same thing
 
01:00:59.630 --> 01:00:59.640 align:start position:0%
here as well so I cannot um support this
 
01:01:01.510 --> 01:01:01.520 align:start position:0%
bill unless it was changed dramatically
 
01:01:03.190 --> 01:01:03.200 align:start position:0%
over the summer time thank you
 
01:01:05.270 --> 01:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
representative Leon uh thank you Mr
 
01:01:07.309 --> 01:01:07.319 align:start position:0%
chairman and uh thank you representative
 
01:01:08.750 --> 01:01:08.760 align:start position:0%
Murphy for actually bringing up a very
 
01:01:11.069 --> 01:01:11.079 align:start position:0%
good point about the general idea of
 
01:01:13.069 --> 01:01:13.079 align:start position:0%
some of the benefit that could come from
 
01:01:15.870 --> 01:01:15.880 align:start position:0%
a better look post death um given the
 
01:01:17.990 --> 01:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
complexities you know there are some
 
01:01:19.950 --> 01:01:19.960 align:start position:0%
areas where it may make sense to have
 
01:01:21.589 --> 01:01:21.599 align:start position:0%
some sort of comprehensive review about
 
01:01:23.990 --> 01:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
not only what has been prescribed but
 
01:01:25.470 --> 01:01:25.480 align:start position:0%
what's been taken if you've been
 
01:01:27.430 --> 01:01:27.440 align:start position:0%
prescribed certain anti psychotics
 
01:01:29.349 --> 01:01:29.359 align:start position:0%
you're not taking them and then a very
 
01:01:31.309 --> 01:01:31.319 align:start position:0%
bad thing happens that may be an
 
01:01:33.750 --> 01:01:33.760 align:start position:0%
important Public Health interest I I do
 
01:01:36.150 --> 01:01:36.160 align:start position:0%
think that it would behoove us to look
 
01:01:38.829 --> 01:01:38.839 align:start position:0%
at how to have a more comprehensive look
 
01:01:41.710 --> 01:01:41.720 align:start position:0%
around um medical decisions and then
 
01:01:44.029 --> 01:01:44.039 align:start position:0%
people's outcome either their death or
 
01:01:46.069 --> 01:01:46.079 align:start position:0%
death that they've caused for others um
 
01:01:47.430 --> 01:01:47.440 align:start position:0%
but I agree that there's a lot about
 
01:01:50.349 --> 01:01:50.359 align:start position:0%
this bill that um was not was not
 
01:01:52.150 --> 01:01:52.160 align:start position:0%
workable and that brought a lot of
 
01:01:54.029 --> 01:01:54.039 align:start position:0%
challenges um I do want to highlight to
 
01:01:55.990 --> 01:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
representative Weber I benefited a lot
 
01:01:57.870 --> 01:01:57.880 align:start position:0%
from um data that came from the Swedish
 
01:01:59.390 --> 01:01:59.400 align:start position:0%
registry that is a lot more
 
01:02:01.349 --> 01:02:01.359 align:start position:0%
comprehensive than anything we would
 
01:02:02.990 --> 01:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
have here because in Sweden they have
 
01:02:04.670 --> 01:02:04.680 align:start position:0%
one Health Care system and your data
 
01:02:06.950 --> 01:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
goes in you don't have a choice uh but
 
01:02:08.630 --> 01:02:08.640 align:start position:0%
even with that there were areas where
 
01:02:10.390 --> 01:02:10.400 align:start position:0%
there wasn't complete information so you
 
01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
couldn't analyze every single person in
 
01:02:15.230 --> 01:02:15.240 align:start position:0%
that group so even if you had some
 
01:02:17.309 --> 01:02:17.319 align:start position:0%
people who had to be excluded from an
 
01:02:19.589 --> 01:02:19.599 align:start position:0%
analysis because you were not certain
 
01:02:21.630 --> 01:02:21.640 align:start position:0%
about their status there's there's ways
 
01:02:23.670 --> 01:02:23.680 align:start position:0%
statistically to deal with that but I
 
01:02:25.230 --> 01:02:25.240 align:start position:0%
recognize that there's a lot of
 
01:02:28.470 --> 01:02:28.480 align:start position:0%
structural issues with the bill um and I
 
01:02:29.789 --> 01:02:29.799 align:start position:0%
guess we'll see where we move on in the
 
01:02:31.510 --> 01:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
afternoon but there's no reason to uh
 
01:02:34.190 --> 01:02:34.200 align:start position:0%
belabor the point at this point so thank
 
01:02:37.190 --> 01:02:37.200 align:start position:0%
you other
 
01:02:40.349 --> 01:02:40.359 align:start position:0%
comments saying on let's move on to the
 
01:02:44.069 --> 01:02:44.079 align:start position:0%
next one which is a 1663 FN which is
 
01:02:45.829 --> 01:02:45.839 align:start position:0%
relative to the confidentiality of
 
01:02:47.670 --> 01:02:47.680 align:start position:0%
medical records and patient information
 
01:02:49.589 --> 01:02:49.599 align:start position:0%
representative Lon uh thank you Mr
 
01:02:51.789 --> 01:02:51.799 align:start position:0%
chairman this bill sought to provide
 
01:02:53.549 --> 01:02:53.559 align:start position:0%
protections and Clarity regarding
 
01:02:55.589 --> 01:02:55.599 align:start position:0%
medical record confidentiality through a
 
01:02:58.150 --> 01:02:58.160 align:start position:0%
re repal and replace method a
 
01:02:59.670 --> 01:02:59.680 align:start position:0%
substantial amount of the testimony that
 
01:03:01.430 --> 01:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
we heard opposing the bill was actually
 
01:03:04.109 --> 01:03:04.119 align:start position:0%
opposing existing parts of current law
 
01:03:06.390 --> 01:03:06.400 align:start position:0%
um so I would recommend to myself if I
 
01:03:08.430 --> 01:03:08.440 align:start position:0%
introduce this in the future to not do a
 
01:03:10.549 --> 01:03:10.559 align:start position:0%
repeal and replace but to have all the
 
01:03:12.349 --> 01:03:12.359 align:start position:0%
changes within there so we can discuss
 
01:03:14.309 --> 01:03:14.319 align:start position:0%
the actual changes to law instead of
 
01:03:16.510 --> 01:03:16.520 align:start position:0%
getting lost in uh trying to tease out
 
01:03:19.269 --> 01:03:19.279 align:start position:0%
the differences
 
01:03:22.589 --> 01:03:22.599 align:start position:0%
um so um there is a need to assess New
 
01:03:24.029 --> 01:03:24.039 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's protections of patient
 
01:03:25.829 --> 01:03:25.839 align:start position:0%
privacy in a more rigorous manner
 
01:03:27.390 --> 01:03:27.400 align:start position:0%
especially given the increased knowledge
 
01:03:29.309 --> 01:03:29.319 align:start position:0%
around hipa a lot of people thought that
 
01:03:31.630 --> 01:03:31.640 align:start position:0%
it was all about privacy but in reality
 
01:03:33.630 --> 01:03:33.640 align:start position:0%
it's about portability and making sure
 
01:03:36.990 --> 01:03:37.000 align:start position:0%
that Providers Insurance companies um in
 
01:03:39.309 --> 01:03:39.319 align:start position:0%
some cases people advertising for
 
01:03:41.829 --> 01:03:41.839 align:start position:0%
different causes um have access to your
 
01:03:44.150 --> 01:03:44.160 align:start position:0%
medical record within an ecosystem that
 
01:03:47.109 --> 01:03:47.119 align:start position:0%
is policed to some Manner and some level
 
01:03:49.269 --> 01:03:49.279 align:start position:0%
federal law does allow us to make state
 
01:03:51.829 --> 01:03:51.839 align:start position:0%
laws more protective of personal privacy
 
01:03:54.269 --> 01:03:54.279 align:start position:0%
and I think that given how often privacy
 
01:03:56.710 --> 01:03:56.720 align:start position:0%
comes up in this committee and in other
 
01:03:58.589 --> 01:03:58.599 align:start position:0%
parts within the state it does make
 
01:04:00.230 --> 01:04:00.240 align:start position:0%
sense to look at it in the future
 
01:04:03.190 --> 01:04:03.200 align:start position:0%
although um I will agree that there were
 
01:04:04.430 --> 01:04:04.440 align:start position:0%
things that I could have done better on
 
01:04:06.950 --> 01:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
this bill so hopefully we can recommend
 
01:04:09.150 --> 01:04:09.160 align:start position:0%
it for future legislation um but I know
 
01:04:11.190 --> 01:04:11.200 align:start position:0%
it will look different than the way that
 
01:04:12.630 --> 01:04:12.640 align:start position:0%
I introduced
 
01:04:15.789 --> 01:04:15.799 align:start position:0%
it other comments representative Nel
 
01:04:17.829 --> 01:04:17.839 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman yeah that that's
 
01:04:20.230 --> 01:04:20.240 align:start position:0%
really helpful and I I appreciate all
 
01:04:23.789 --> 01:04:23.799 align:start position:0%
the points that you rais um it seems to
 
01:04:25.390 --> 01:04:25.400 align:start position:0%
me you know just looking at the people
 
01:04:27.870 --> 01:04:27.880 align:start position:0%
that responded to this virtually all the
 
01:04:31.349 --> 01:04:31.359 align:start position:0%
responses I saw were kind of negative um
 
01:04:32.750 --> 01:04:32.760 align:start position:0%
mostly because you know I've been
 
01:04:34.710 --> 01:04:34.720 align:start position:0%
involved in healthcare now for about 40
 
01:04:37.309 --> 01:04:37.319 align:start position:0%
years and I've I've watched the Health
 
01:04:39.789 --> 01:04:39.799 align:start position:0%
Care system change dramatically where
 
01:04:41.750 --> 01:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
there's more and more oversight we spend
 
01:04:43.630 --> 01:04:43.640 align:start position:0%
more and more time dealing with
 
01:04:45.630 --> 01:04:45.640 align:start position:0%
paperwork and computers and less and
 
01:04:49.150 --> 01:04:49.160 align:start position:0%
less time with um patients and that kind
 
01:04:51.150 --> 01:04:51.160 align:start position:0%
of really screws up the way we practice
 
01:04:53.190 --> 01:04:53.200 align:start position:0%
healthc care and a lot of them saw this
 
01:04:56.230 --> 01:04:56.240 align:start position:0%
as as doing that which I think
 
01:04:58.789 --> 01:04:58.799 align:start position:0%
you raise a a valid point that's a
 
01:05:00.829 --> 01:05:00.839 align:start position:0%
problem to me like the way I like to
 
01:05:03.150 --> 01:05:03.160 align:start position:0%
deal with these things is like an ad hoc
 
01:05:05.029 --> 01:05:05.039 align:start position:0%
multi-stakeholder group this is a
 
01:05:06.870 --> 01:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
problem how do we fix it how do we solve
 
01:05:09.950 --> 01:05:09.960 align:start position:0%
it without making your life miserable
 
01:05:12.150 --> 01:05:12.160 align:start position:0%
and as a doctor I would kind of
 
01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
appreciate that kind of format to
 
01:05:15.510 --> 01:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
dealing with this and then coming up
 
01:05:16.990 --> 01:05:17.000 align:start position:0%
with legislation that respects
 
01:05:19.710 --> 01:05:19.720 align:start position:0%
everybody's needs and wishes and because
 
01:05:21.069 --> 01:05:21.079 align:start position:0%
I just think we've been harming healthc
 
01:05:22.910 --> 01:05:22.920 align:start position:0%
care too much the last 30
 
01:05:26.470 --> 01:05:26.480 align:start position:0%
years representative Weber
 
01:05:28.910 --> 01:05:28.920 align:start position:0%
thank you and I I thank you both for
 
01:05:31.150 --> 01:05:31.160 align:start position:0%
your comments because there's a lot that
 
01:05:35.150 --> 01:05:35.160 align:start position:0%
I agree with in both of them uh I I
 
01:05:39.029 --> 01:05:39.039 align:start position:0%
think that this for me personally is an
 
01:05:43.670 --> 01:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
example of one where um I think the
 
01:05:46.789 --> 01:05:46.799 align:start position:0%
report writing is going to be delicate I
 
01:05:50.630 --> 01:05:50.640 align:start position:0%
think I would tend to vote
 
01:05:53.589 --> 01:05:53.599 align:start position:0%
that this bill this approach is not
 
01:05:56.029 --> 01:05:56.039 align:start position:0%
something that I think should go forward
 
01:05:58.150 --> 01:05:58.160 align:start position:0%
but we've already had that
 
01:06:01.430 --> 01:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
acknowledgement on the approach and that
 
01:06:03.230 --> 01:06:03.240 align:start position:0%
I I think that the report should
 
01:06:05.510 --> 01:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that both
 
01:06:10.870 --> 01:06:10.880 align:start position:0%
privacy and um functionality for
 
01:06:13.950 --> 01:06:13.960 align:start position:0%
practitioners and uh privacy for
 
01:06:15.670 --> 01:06:15.680 align:start position:0%
patients and functionality for
 
01:06:17.990 --> 01:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
practitioners are things of concern to
 
01:06:22.230 --> 01:06:22.240 align:start position:0%
everyone so in so far as that is um an
 
01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:23.470 align:start position:0%
everyone so in so far as that is um an
ongoing

01:06:23.470 --> 01:06:23.480 align:start position:0%
ongoing
 
01:06:25.870 --> 01:06:25.880 align:start position:0%
conversation I I think we're probably
 
01:06:27.309 --> 01:06:27.319 align:start position:0%
all in agreement that we're going to be
 
01:06:29.910 --> 01:06:29.920 align:start position:0%
having that conversation in many formats
 
01:06:32.710 --> 01:06:32.720 align:start position:0%
but uh I think my vote would be that
 
01:06:35.230 --> 01:06:35.240 align:start position:0%
this is not the
 
01:06:39.630 --> 01:06:39.640 align:start position:0%
bill to have that conversation on so
 
01:06:41.670 --> 01:06:41.680 align:start position:0%
coming to different conclusions for
 
01:06:45.190 --> 01:06:45.200 align:start position:0%
roughly the same reasons which is odd
 
01:06:47.950 --> 01:06:47.960 align:start position:0%
but other comments representative Murphy
 
01:06:49.589 --> 01:06:49.599 align:start position:0%
so my mind is mostly a question for the
 
01:06:54.549 --> 01:06:54.559 align:start position:0%
primary um sponsor of the bill in my to
 
01:06:56.510 --> 01:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
understand you that you would
 
01:06:58.710 --> 01:06:58.720 align:start position:0%
not want to go forward with this bill
 
01:07:00.829 --> 01:07:00.839 align:start position:0%
and Amendment but come up with a
 
01:07:02.710 --> 01:07:02.720 align:start position:0%
separate legislation you know entirely
 
01:07:04.430 --> 01:07:04.440 align:start position:0%
separate from this one going forward in
 
01:07:06.870 --> 01:07:06.880 align:start position:0%
the next legislation uh well thank you
 
01:07:08.630 --> 01:07:08.640 align:start position:0%
for that if it if we were to move
 
01:07:10.029 --> 01:07:10.039 align:start position:0%
forward somebody would need to take that
 
01:07:13.109 --> 01:07:13.119 align:start position:0%
to OS and draft the language uh for one
 
01:07:14.549 --> 01:07:14.559 align:start position:0%
I would not do it as a repeal and
 
01:07:16.589 --> 01:07:16.599 align:start position:0%
replace and for the second I would take
 
01:07:18.670 --> 01:07:18.680 align:start position:0%
a lot of the testimony that we heard in
 
01:07:20.309 --> 01:07:20.319 align:start position:0%
order to balance the privacy and the
 
01:07:22.069 --> 01:07:22.079 align:start position:0%
functionality because the last thing I
 
01:07:23.829 --> 01:07:23.839 align:start position:0%
want to do is add more bureaucracy and
 
01:07:26.069 --> 01:07:26.079 align:start position:0%
red red tape to assist system that is
 
01:07:29.630 --> 01:07:29.640 align:start position:0%
already nearly strangled by that um but
 
01:07:30.829 --> 01:07:30.839 align:start position:0%
I also want to make sure that we're
 
01:07:33.029 --> 01:07:33.039 align:start position:0%
balancing balancing the different needs
 
01:07:35.589 --> 01:07:35.599 align:start position:0%
that we have um I don't have one in
 
01:07:37.309 --> 01:07:37.319 align:start position:0%
drafting for the coming year but there
 
01:07:39.910 --> 01:07:39.920 align:start position:0%
may be one in the second second year and
 
01:07:41.269 --> 01:07:41.279 align:start position:0%
that would only be if I work with an
 
01:07:43.870 --> 01:07:43.880 align:start position:0%
adhawk group but I would rather not sort
 
01:07:46.269 --> 01:07:46.279 align:start position:0%
of snuff out the light on this uh
 
01:07:48.430 --> 01:07:48.440 align:start position:0%
because this did have uh bipartisan
 
01:07:50.630 --> 01:07:50.640 align:start position:0%
sponsorship and so that we could move
 
01:07:52.950 --> 01:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
forward and work together to make sure
 
01:07:54.950 --> 01:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
that we're protecting privacy and just
 
01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:56.269 align:start position:0%
that we're protecting privacy and just
rebuild

01:07:56.269 --> 01:07:56.279 align:start position:0%
rebuild
 
01:07:57.950 --> 01:07:57.960 align:start position:0%
so much trust has been lost in all
 
01:08:01.069 --> 01:08:01.079 align:start position:0%
systems government everything we need to
 
01:08:03.069 --> 01:08:03.079 align:start position:0%
rebuild that because if we can't rebuild
 
01:08:05.309 --> 01:08:05.319 align:start position:0%
Trust on a whole we're going to lose the
 
01:08:07.269 --> 01:08:07.279 align:start position:0%
society that we have and that would be a
 
01:08:09.630 --> 01:08:09.640 align:start position:0%
shame um but part of that comes with
 
01:08:12.190 --> 01:08:12.200 align:start position:0%
respecting privacy and respecting and
 
01:08:13.870 --> 01:08:13.880 align:start position:0%
respecting the ability for doctors and
 
01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
other practitioners to do their job
 
01:08:18.669 --> 01:08:18.679 align:start position:0%
without too much um too much red tape so
 
01:08:20.590 --> 01:08:20.600 align:start position:0%
I think that it's something that if we
 
01:08:22.510 --> 01:08:22.520 align:start position:0%
had the bandwidth if we had the ability
 
01:08:24.390 --> 01:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
it would greatly benefit the people of
 
01:08:26.990 --> 01:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire but it would need to be a
 
01:08:29.349 --> 01:08:29.359 align:start position:0%
large effort where we get together lots
 
01:08:31.829 --> 01:08:31.839 align:start position:0%
of stakeholders work hard over a summer
 
01:08:34.269 --> 01:08:34.279 align:start position:0%
not necessarily through this process um
 
01:08:36.229 --> 01:08:36.239 align:start position:0%
and then bring some language to the
 
01:08:37.870 --> 01:08:37.880 align:start position:0%
legislature that's been more fully
 
01:08:41.269 --> 01:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
vetted uh because this touches everybody
 
01:08:42.870 --> 01:08:42.880 align:start position:0%
and sometimes it touches you as both a
 
01:08:45.789 --> 01:08:45.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:48.669 --> 01:08:48.679 align:start position:0%

chairman um I just can't get myself out
 
01:09:13.269 --> 01:09:13.279 align:start position:0%
of the healthcare world I get the mudcap
 
01:09:15.309 --> 01:09:15.319 align:start position:0%
news updates all the time and I can't
 
01:09:16.950 --> 01:09:16.960 align:start position:0%
tell you how many times I've heard
 
01:09:19.149 --> 01:09:19.159 align:start position:0%
something about a jamama article
 
01:09:22.149 --> 01:09:22.159 align:start position:0%
comparing psychedelics to existing
 
01:09:24.829 --> 01:09:24.839 align:start position:0%
anti-depressants and when I've seen that
 
01:09:26.070 --> 01:09:26.080 align:start position:0%
this is something that's moving forward
 
01:09:29.110 --> 01:09:29.120 align:start position:0%
in medicine uh right now the VA is doing
 
01:09:31.550 --> 01:09:31.560 align:start position:0%
some research on it uh Mass General
 
01:09:33.789 --> 01:09:33.799 align:start position:0%
Hospital has a treatment center and they
 
01:09:35.229 --> 01:09:35.239 align:start position:0%
have some facilities here in New
 
01:09:37.709 --> 01:09:37.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh but right now New Hampshire
 
01:09:40.030 --> 01:09:40.040 align:start position:0%
law prohibits a clinical trial from
 
01:09:42.630 --> 01:09:42.640 align:start position:0%
happening in the state with psychedelics
 
01:09:44.390 --> 01:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
because of its status as a controlled
 
01:09:47.030 --> 01:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
substance um I think that having to send
 
01:09:49.149 --> 01:09:49.159 align:start position:0%
patients out of state to participate in
 
01:09:50.510 --> 01:09:50.520 align:start position:0%
this especially if they're dealing with
 
01:09:54.189 --> 01:09:54.199 align:start position:0%
something like PTSD or end of life fears
 
01:09:56.950 --> 01:09:56.960 align:start position:0%
um I I think that we should move forward
 
01:10:00.430 --> 01:10:00.440 align:start position:0%
with a much much much narrower process
 
01:10:01.910 --> 01:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
in order to make sure that we're not
 
01:10:03.550 --> 01:10:03.560 align:start position:0%
interfering with a clinical trial
 
01:10:06.470 --> 01:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
process in a highly supervised um
 
01:10:08.430 --> 01:10:08.440 align:start position:0%
environment however the idea of trying
 
01:10:10.830 --> 01:10:10.840 align:start position:0%
to set up an entire alternate ATC
 
01:10:14.030 --> 01:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
program for psychedelics is unworkable
 
01:10:15.590 --> 01:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
um that's something that I'd hop to
 
01:10:17.310 --> 01:10:17.320 align:start position:0%
discuss with the prime sponsor and move
 
01:10:19.390 --> 01:10:19.400 align:start position:0%
forward however he did not attend the
 
01:10:23.070 --> 01:10:23.080 align:start position:0%
hearing um and I don't want patients who
 
01:10:25.310 --> 01:10:25.320 align:start position:0%
could benefit from what the FDA is
 
01:10:27.790 --> 01:10:27.800 align:start position:0%
designated as a breakthrough therapy to
 
01:10:29.750 --> 01:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
suffer simply because there wasn't the
 
01:10:32.870 --> 01:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
effort to work on language um to revise
 
01:10:34.550 --> 01:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
his bill as opposed to come back in the
 
01:10:35.990 --> 01:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
future with one that would enable
 
01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:37.310 align:start position:0%
future with one that would enable
clinical

01:10:37.310 --> 01:10:37.320 align:start position:0%
clinical
 
01:10:40.750 --> 01:10:40.760 align:start position:0%
trials representative Weber and I would
 
01:10:42.550 --> 01:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
just say that I agree with absolutely
 
01:10:44.790 --> 01:10:44.800 align:start position:0%
everything you just said that I think
 
01:10:48.830 --> 01:10:48.840 align:start position:0%
the the place for the trials is within
 
01:10:52.149 --> 01:10:52.159 align:start position:0%
the medical community and under strict
 
01:10:55.510 --> 01:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
supervision but if the medical community
 
01:10:57.229 --> 01:10:57.239 align:start position:0%
needs the tools for us to be able to do
 
01:10:59.950 --> 01:10:59.960 align:start position:0%
it we should be helping them so that
 
01:11:02.910 --> 01:11:02.920 align:start position:0%
anything that shows promise as a
 
01:11:06.070 --> 01:11:06.080 align:start position:0%
treatment option can be appropriately
 
01:11:10.470 --> 01:11:10.480 align:start position:0%
evaluated and and moved forward as it is
 
01:11:12.709 --> 01:11:12.719 align:start position:0%
as it is shown to be useful so thank you
 
01:11:15.630 --> 01:11:15.640 align:start position:0%
for that representative Nel thank you Mr
 
01:11:17.310 --> 01:11:17.320 align:start position:0%
chairman I guess that gets me back to
 
01:11:19.630 --> 01:11:19.640 align:start position:0%
the pragmatics of this because I don't
 
01:11:21.550 --> 01:11:21.560 align:start position:0%
support this bill as written but I
 
01:11:24.030 --> 01:11:24.040 align:start position:0%
support everything you just
 
01:11:26.910 --> 01:11:26.920 align:start position:0%
said is is that like a vote Yes we want
 
01:11:29.470 --> 01:11:29.480 align:start position:0%
to look at further legislation or say no
 
01:11:30.630 --> 01:11:30.640 align:start position:0%
I want you to come up with something
 
01:11:32.790 --> 01:11:32.800 align:start position:0%
totally different next time
 
01:11:35.430 --> 01:11:35.440 align:start position:0%
representative lay on um so part of it
 
01:11:38.110 --> 01:11:38.120 align:start position:0%
is if you could agree with this as the
 
01:11:40.390 --> 01:11:40.400 align:start position:0%
committee report statement New Hampshire
 
01:11:42.390 --> 01:11:42.400 align:start position:0%
state law currently prevents research
 
01:11:44.350 --> 01:11:44.360 align:start position:0%
Andor treatments which use psychedelic
 
01:11:46.669 --> 01:11:46.679 align:start position:0%
drugs despite the expanding Research
 
01:11:48.510 --> 01:11:48.520 align:start position:0%
into this area the Veterans
 
01:11:50.470 --> 01:11:50.480 align:start position:0%
Administration and Massachusetts General
 
01:11:52.030 --> 01:11:52.040 align:start position:0%
Hospital are currently conducting
 
01:11:54.149 --> 01:11:54.159 align:start position:0%
research for a number of disorders and
 
01:11:56.110 --> 01:11:56.120 align:start position:0%
the FDA has granted breakthrough therapy
 
01:11:58.270 --> 01:11:58.280 align:start position:0%
designation for some psychedelics we
 
01:12:00.229 --> 01:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
recommend future legislation to permit
 
01:12:02.110 --> 01:12:02.120 align:start position:0%
patients access to clinical trials or
 
01:12:03.669 --> 01:12:03.679 align:start position:0%
other therapy without the need to cross
 
01:12:05.470 --> 01:12:05.480 align:start position:0%
state lines for care I could add
 
01:12:08.229 --> 01:12:08.239 align:start position:0%
language to say in um in a in a
 
01:12:10.390 --> 01:12:10.400 align:start position:0%
supervised medical one but that that is
 
01:12:13.750 --> 01:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
my intent of the language so a lot of
 
01:12:15.070 --> 01:12:15.080 align:start position:0%
this does come down to how we split
 
01:12:16.669 --> 01:12:16.679 align:start position:0%
hairs about the recommended for future
 
01:12:18.070 --> 01:12:18.080 align:start position:0%
legislation but I think that if we
 
01:12:20.070 --> 01:12:20.080 align:start position:0%
narrow the funnel and say what we think
 
01:12:21.510 --> 01:12:21.520 align:start position:0%
was good about a bill I think that's
 
01:12:25.270 --> 01:12:25.280 align:start position:0%
helpful for future legislators
 
01:12:28.470 --> 01:12:28.480 align:start position:0%
question of another person here sure go
 
01:12:32.430 --> 01:12:32.440 align:start position:0%
ahead representative Murphy sorry do you
 
01:12:36.590 --> 01:12:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:38.750 --> 01:12:38.760 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth because that's a psychedelic
 
01:12:40.430 --> 01:12:40.440 align:start position:0%
functionally and that you know we used
 
01:12:41.870 --> 01:12:41.880 align:start position:0%
to have to have patients go to Germany
 
01:12:45.910 --> 01:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
to get that ketamine infusions for pain
 
01:12:47.510 --> 01:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
retraction I don't know that for sure I
 
01:12:49.950 --> 01:12:49.960 align:start position:0%
know that we use ketamine in the O but I
 
01:12:52.590 --> 01:12:52.600 align:start position:0%
don't know that it's used as a treatment
 
01:12:54.550 --> 01:12:54.560 align:start position:0%
option uh it would be better asked of
 
01:12:56.629 --> 01:12:56.639 align:start position:0%
somebody from DH I'm just curious
 
01:12:57.990 --> 01:12:58.000 align:start position:0%
because we're already doing a
 
01:13:01.950 --> 01:13:01.960 align:start position:0%
psychedelic you know this is I left DH
 
01:13:05.470 --> 01:13:05.480 align:start position:0%
about quite a few years ago so I'm not
 
01:13:08.110 --> 01:13:08.120 align:start position:0%
sure if they do that right now they
 
01:13:10.229 --> 01:13:10.239 align:start position:0%
might you want to
 
01:13:12.830 --> 01:13:12.840 align:start position:0%
speak representative Weber I was just
 
01:13:14.629 --> 01:13:14.639 align:start position:0%
going to say in partial answer to your
 
01:13:16.950 --> 01:13:16.960 align:start position:0%
earlier question that certainly if
 
01:13:18.709 --> 01:13:18.719 align:start position:0%
that's the way the report's going to be
 
01:13:21.830 --> 01:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
written and it's recommended for further
 
01:13:24.189 --> 01:13:24.199 align:start position:0%
action I I certainly would vote for it I
 
01:13:26.430 --> 01:13:26.440 align:start position:0%
think I think the devils in
 
01:13:29.750 --> 01:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
the the the meat of the recommendation
 
01:13:32.350 --> 01:13:32.360 align:start position:0%
is in how you write the report and that
 
01:13:34.790 --> 01:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
seems to me to encapsulate all the
 
01:13:39.470 --> 01:13:39.480 align:start position:0%
concerns that I had and and put out very
 
01:13:42.590 --> 01:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
clearly uh what might be the scope of
 
01:13:44.470 --> 01:13:44.480 align:start position:0%
future action
 
01:13:46.830 --> 01:13:46.840 align:start position:0%
so representative
 
01:13:50.189 --> 01:13:50.199 align:start position:0%
McKay thank you Mr chairman could
 
01:13:56.110 --> 01:13:56.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:57.390 --> 01:13:57.400 align:start position:0%
yes I I don't know what that
 
01:13:58.790 --> 01:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
representative Leon is looking up the
 
01:14:01.110 --> 01:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
definition so um some of the drugs that
 
01:14:04.629 --> 01:14:04.639 align:start position:0%
are being researched for you um for
 
01:14:06.830 --> 01:14:06.840 align:start position:0%
Within These are psilocybin which is
 
01:14:10.430 --> 01:14:10.440 align:start position:0%
from the mushrooms um MDMA which um is
 
01:14:13.550 --> 01:14:13.560 align:start position:0%
called ecstasy that one I believe is for
 
01:14:16.550 --> 01:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
um I believe it's both for PTSD I know
 
01:14:19.070 --> 01:14:19.080 align:start position:0%
that it's also for um end of life
 
01:14:21.470 --> 01:14:21.480 align:start position:0%
concerns and fears when people are s
 
01:14:24.110 --> 01:14:24.120 align:start position:0%
suffering debilitating fears uh there's
 
01:14:25.910 --> 01:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
been a significant amount of research on
 
01:14:28.990 --> 01:14:29.000 align:start position:0%
it but a lot of this is looking to use
 
01:14:31.189 --> 01:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
some of these I guess some are lab
 
01:14:33.870 --> 01:14:33.880 align:start position:0%
created some are more naturally derived
 
01:14:35.830 --> 01:14:35.840 align:start position:0%
but um within the scope of this law it
 
01:14:37.550 --> 01:14:37.560 align:start position:0%
would it would be looking to be a
 
01:14:39.430 --> 01:14:39.440 align:start position:0%
clinical trial that's been approved from
 
01:14:42.709 --> 01:14:42.719 align:start position:0%
an IRB most likely um although I'm not
 
01:14:44.310 --> 01:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
sure exactly how tight we want to get on
 
01:14:46.189 --> 01:14:46.199 align:start position:0%
this um because we don't want to tie the
 
01:14:47.709 --> 01:14:47.719 align:start position:0%
hands but the intention would be for a
 
01:14:50.669 --> 01:14:50.679 align:start position:0%
clinical trial and I know soy and MD and
 
01:14:53.709 --> 01:14:53.719 align:start position:0%
MDMA both have breakthrough um status
 
01:14:57.470 --> 01:14:57.480 align:start position:0%
designation at the FD da thank
 
01:15:00.629 --> 01:15:00.639 align:start position:0%
you representative n i I just wanted to
 
01:15:02.430 --> 01:15:02.440 align:start position:0%
point out something interesting because
 
01:15:05.669 --> 01:15:05.679 align:start position:0%
this is my clinical experience but back
 
01:15:07.629 --> 01:15:07.639 align:start position:0%
in 1990 there was a gentleman that
 
01:15:09.709 --> 01:15:09.719 align:start position:0%
published a study looking at um elicit
 
01:15:11.550 --> 01:15:11.560 align:start position:0%
drug trade in New York City and he
 
01:15:13.790 --> 01:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
identified two different groups of drug
 
01:15:15.590 --> 01:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
dealers one were the people that dealt
 
01:15:17.629 --> 01:15:17.639 align:start position:0%
with it for you to get high the other
 
01:15:19.590 --> 01:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
ones that were dealing drugs to help you
 
01:15:22.030 --> 01:15:22.040 align:start position:0%
treat a symptom they called themselves
 
01:15:23.790 --> 01:15:23.800 align:start position:0%
Street doctors and they were totally
 
01:15:25.870 --> 01:15:25.880 align:start position:0%
illegal totally the reason they were
 
01:15:27.629 --> 01:15:27.639 align:start position:0%
doing it is because of the HMO
 
01:15:29.470 --> 01:15:29.480 align:start position:0%
flourishing in that time frame people
 
01:15:32.110 --> 01:15:32.120 align:start position:0%
couldn't get the drugs they needed what
 
01:15:34.550 --> 01:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
I've seen in my world that I'm a little
 
01:15:37.149 --> 01:15:37.159 align:start position:0%
bit silent about is that there's
 
01:15:39.830 --> 01:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
experimentation going on these drugs
 
01:15:42.149 --> 01:15:42.159 align:start position:0%
every day and in a substantial
 
01:15:44.350 --> 01:15:44.360 align:start position:0%
percentage of the patients that I see
 
01:15:46.550 --> 01:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
all the time there would be certainly a
 
01:15:49.229 --> 01:15:49.239 align:start position:0%
benefit to having oversight of that from
 
01:15:51.030 --> 01:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
you know a medical provider that's
 
01:15:53.229 --> 01:15:53.239 align:start position:0%
really not happening and that's really
 
01:15:55.550 --> 01:15:55.560 align:start position:0%
why what you said is really important
 
01:15:57.709 --> 01:15:57.719 align:start position:0%
so representative Weber and then
 
01:16:01.830 --> 01:16:01.840 align:start position:0%
representative Lon and just in in in
 
01:16:04.709 --> 01:16:04.719 align:start position:0%
further answer to um representative
 
01:16:09.030 --> 01:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
McKay's question uh the uh word
 
01:16:11.310 --> 01:16:11.320 align:start position:0%
psychedelics for the purpose of this
 
01:16:14.430 --> 01:16:14.440 align:start position:0%
bill is defined specifically as any of
 
01:16:17.629 --> 01:16:17.639 align:start position:0%
the following sub substances psilocybin
 
01:16:22.709 --> 01:16:22.719 align:start position:0%
lysergic acid DL LSD and musculine and
 
01:16:26.390 --> 01:16:26.400 align:start position:0%
then there's a further um
 
01:16:29.830 --> 01:16:29.840 align:start position:0%
definition of celoc cybin uh meaning
 
01:16:31.510 --> 01:16:31.520 align:start position:0%
anything that came from that particular
 
01:16:34.550 --> 01:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
fungus so it is limited to three very
 
01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:36.110 align:start position:0%
fungus so it is limited to three very
specific

01:16:36.110 --> 01:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
specific
 
01:16:40.149 --> 01:16:40.159 align:start position:0%
things um but uh I think I think it
 
01:16:44.390 --> 01:16:44.400 align:start position:0%
still Bears the the issue of let's let's
 
01:16:46.149 --> 01:16:46.159 align:start position:0%
look at it carefully under controlled
 
01:16:47.830 --> 01:16:47.840 align:start position:0%
circumstances and if we're standing in
 
01:16:50.189 --> 01:16:50.199 align:start position:0%
the way of that we ought to figure out
 
01:16:53.350 --> 01:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
how to quietly and with the least amount
 
01:16:58.110 --> 01:16:58.120 align:start position:0%
of um intervention get out of the way of
 
01:17:00.870 --> 01:17:00.880 align:start position:0%
progress representative Leon uh thank
 
01:17:02.629 --> 01:17:02.639 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman uh thank you for
 
01:17:04.110 --> 01:17:04.120 align:start position:0%
bringing up ketamine ketamine is a
 
01:17:07.470 --> 01:17:07.480 align:start position:0%
schedule three drug um just like binin
 
01:17:09.350 --> 01:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
and anabolic steroids so those can be
 
01:17:11.390 --> 01:17:11.400 align:start position:0%
prescribed and that's not against New
 
01:17:13.790 --> 01:17:13.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law schedule two which is RA
 
01:17:16.870 --> 01:17:16.880 align:start position:0%
opium oxycodone cocaine and Fentanyl uh
 
01:17:18.709 --> 01:17:18.719 align:start position:0%
those are all can be prescribed within
 
01:17:21.229 --> 01:17:21.239 align:start position:0%
certain scenarios but all of the drugs
 
01:17:23.790 --> 01:17:23.800 align:start position:0%
within this are in schedule one which
 
01:17:26.709 --> 01:17:26.719 align:start position:0%
are their deem as having no medical use
 
01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:28.320 align:start position:0%
and that's why New Hampshire law would
 
01:17:30.149 --> 01:17:30.159 align:start position:0%
need to carve out the ability for those
 
01:17:32.149 --> 01:17:32.159 align:start position:0%
these particular schedule one drugs to
 
01:17:34.750 --> 01:17:34.760 align:start position:0%
be used um and that's what that's why
 
01:17:35.990 --> 01:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
it's an issue and that's why we're in
 
01:17:37.510 --> 01:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
the way
 
01:17:40.510 --> 01:17:40.520 align:start position:0%
potentially representative Shapero thank
 
01:17:44.390 --> 01:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
you um I I would certainly um be happy
 
01:17:47.550 --> 01:17:47.560 align:start position:0%
to um vote Yes on representative Leon's
 
01:17:51.030 --> 01:17:51.040 align:start position:0%
language I actually feel
 
01:17:54.990 --> 01:17:55.000 align:start position:0%
um that a broader expansion and legal
 
01:17:56.669 --> 01:17:56.679 align:start position:0%
ation would be
 
01:18:00.510 --> 01:18:00.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate um than just clinical
 
01:18:02.669 --> 01:18:02.679 align:start position:0%
trials but I can't imagine that
 
01:18:04.709 --> 01:18:04.719 align:start position:0%
happening I mean it just seems like it's
 
01:18:08.910 --> 01:18:08.920 align:start position:0%
such an enormous amount of work to um
 
01:18:10.590 --> 01:18:10.600 align:start position:0%
that would have to go into it and we've
 
01:18:13.629 --> 01:18:13.639 align:start position:0%
seen from the attempts to
 
01:18:17.390 --> 01:18:17.400 align:start position:0%
legalize um recreational marijuana how
 
01:18:21.790 --> 01:18:21.800 align:start position:0%
you know the the way every element of a
 
01:18:25.430 --> 01:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
bill has to be considered and part first
 
01:18:29.430 --> 01:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
and um so it seems like any broader
 
01:18:33.709 --> 01:18:33.719 align:start position:0%
expansion of psychedelics would
 
01:18:37.390 --> 01:18:37.400 align:start position:0%
be enormous amount of work that I don't
 
01:18:41.310 --> 01:18:41.320 align:start position:0%
see anybody um working on in the legisl
 
01:18:44.070 --> 01:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
in the legislature um I mean there was
 
01:18:45.910 --> 01:18:45.920 align:start position:0%
this bill but it was just basically
 
01:18:48.030 --> 01:18:48.040 align:start position:0%
saying we should legalize all these
 
01:18:51.510 --> 01:18:51.520 align:start position:0%
things uh and so I think I think the
 
01:18:53.470 --> 01:18:53.480 align:start position:0%
word the language that you used would be
 
01:18:55.750 --> 01:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
a very good first step it would be it
 
01:18:57.990 --> 01:18:58.000 align:start position:0%
would allow certain things to happen in
 
01:19:00.430 --> 01:19:00.440 align:start position:0%
state that then people could consider
 
01:19:02.189 --> 01:19:02.199 align:start position:0%
into the
 
01:19:04.669 --> 01:19:04.679 align:start position:0%
future thank
 
01:19:08.350 --> 01:19:08.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:11.430 --> 01:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
else okay moving on to the next bill HP
 
01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:12.870 align:start position:0%
else okay moving on to the next bill HP

procedure anyone have any comments or
 
01:19:22.030 --> 01:19:22.040 align:start position:0%
thoughts on
 
01:19:25.470 --> 01:19:25.480 align:start position:0%

representative

Nels

01:19:29.990 --> 01:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
Nels
 
01:19:33.470 --> 01:19:33.480 align:start position:0%
um I I had a big problem with the bill
 
01:19:37.189 --> 01:19:37.199 align:start position:0%
as it is I saw it as a slippery
 
01:19:40.510 --> 01:19:40.520 align:start position:0%
slope um that would dictate an informed
 
01:19:42.790 --> 01:19:42.800 align:start position:0%
consent for one specific issue when we
 
01:19:44.669 --> 01:19:44.679 align:start position:0%
deal with hundreds of thousands of
 
01:19:46.830 --> 01:19:46.840 align:start position:0%
different medical issues and procedures
 
01:19:48.669 --> 01:19:48.679 align:start position:0%
and interventions and things like that
 
01:19:51.790 --> 01:19:51.800 align:start position:0%
with that said the bill brought up the
 
01:19:54.310 --> 01:19:54.320 align:start position:0%
important issue of informed consent that
 
01:19:56.790 --> 01:19:56.800 align:start position:0%
I think we're H is in our medical legal
 
01:19:59.629 --> 01:19:59.639 align:start position:0%
world right now is significantly flawed
 
01:20:02.830 --> 01:20:02.840 align:start position:0%
um it ceases to use a as a format to
 
01:20:04.629 --> 01:20:04.639 align:start position:0%
inform patients of what they're getting
 
01:20:07.189 --> 01:20:07.199 align:start position:0%
into but merely is a means of covering
 
01:20:10.990 --> 01:20:11.000 align:start position:0%
risk benefit and for the provider having
 
01:20:13.189 --> 01:20:13.199 align:start position:0%
had to rewrite about 10 informed
 
01:20:15.229 --> 01:20:15.239 align:start position:0%
consents last year that our Risk
 
01:20:17.149 --> 01:20:17.159 align:start position:0%
Management Department made me do and
 
01:20:19.790 --> 01:20:19.800 align:start position:0%
when I saw the outcome of them I was
 
01:20:21.590 --> 01:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
really appalled because they didn't
 
01:20:24.910 --> 01:20:24.920 align:start position:0%
inform the patient of anything um so I
 
01:20:26.470 --> 01:20:26.480 align:start position:0%
did think that this brought up an
 
01:20:29.070 --> 01:20:29.080 align:start position:0%
incredibly important issue and if we
 
01:20:32.870 --> 01:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
frame the report in terms of that and
 
01:20:35.629 --> 01:20:35.639 align:start position:0%
not the specific issue of circumcision
 
01:20:38.310 --> 01:20:38.320 align:start position:0%
then I'm very supportive of this if it's
 
01:20:40.470 --> 01:20:40.480 align:start position:0%
the circumcision issue specifically I
 
01:20:43.590 --> 01:20:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:48.070 --> 01:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
that representative Pap M commenting as
 
01:20:50.830 --> 01:20:50.840 align:start position:0%
a patient and God knows at my age I'm a
 
01:20:55.830 --> 01:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
patient here and there I have not seen a
 
01:20:58.390 --> 01:20:58.400 align:start position:0%
informed consent process which I felt
 
01:21:01.030 --> 01:21:01.040 align:start position:0%
was meaningful in a long long time you
 
01:21:02.709 --> 01:21:02.719 align:start position:0%
go there they give you the little black
 
01:21:03.910 --> 01:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
box and they tell you the name of the
 
01:21:05.870 --> 01:21:05.880 align:start position:0%
form you're signing you don't see it
 
01:21:08.189 --> 01:21:08.199 align:start position:0%
sure you could ask for it if you are
 
01:21:10.270 --> 01:21:10.280 align:start position:0%
willing to disrupt their process because
 
01:21:12.550 --> 01:21:12.560 align:start position:0%
they have five more people waiting I
 
01:21:13.870 --> 01:21:13.880 align:start position:0%
understand part of why the process
 
01:21:15.750 --> 01:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
evolved this way is that we do create
 
01:21:18.470 --> 01:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
all that red tape and the practices have
 
01:21:20.830 --> 01:21:20.840 align:start position:0%
to be able to streamline their
 
01:21:23.030 --> 01:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
operations and they meet the law in the
 
01:21:25.350 --> 01:21:25.360 align:start position:0%
best way they can so I'm not you know
 
01:21:27.709 --> 01:21:27.719 align:start position:0%
assuming any ill intent but I would
 
01:21:29.910 --> 01:21:29.920 align:start position:0%
welcome again a more Nuance discussion
 
01:21:32.030 --> 01:21:32.040 align:start position:0%
on informed consent that would make it
 
01:21:34.830 --> 01:21:34.840 align:start position:0%
meaningful without hamstringing medical
 
01:21:36.510 --> 01:21:36.520 align:start position:0%
service providers and I'm in no way
 
01:21:38.709 --> 01:21:38.719 align:start position:0%
saying this bill is the way to do it but
 
01:21:40.470 --> 01:21:40.480 align:start position:0%
I think the issue in general deserves
 
01:21:43.110 --> 01:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
more attention lately thank you
 
01:21:44.629 --> 01:21:44.639 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy thank you Mr
 
01:21:47.590 --> 01:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
chairman I I think this is basically
 
01:21:49.910 --> 01:21:49.920 align:start position:0%
what representative Nagel was getting at
 
01:21:53.270 --> 01:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
in and also um what you were talking
 
01:21:55.830 --> 01:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
about as well is
 
01:21:59.189 --> 01:21:59.199 align:start position:0%
that it's it's hard for me to have a
 
01:22:01.790 --> 01:22:01.800 align:start position:0%
bill go forward by legislators that
 
01:22:04.350 --> 01:22:04.360 align:start position:0%
deals with a specific procedure IE
 
01:22:07.950 --> 01:22:07.960 align:start position:0%
circumcision so you know parents make
 
01:22:10.070 --> 01:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
informed consents for their for the kids
 
01:22:11.550 --> 01:22:11.560 align:start position:0%
all the time up up until the age of
 
01:22:14.070 --> 01:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
their 21 they make informed decisions
 
01:22:17.270 --> 01:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
for them so you know my question is not
 
01:22:20.390 --> 01:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
specifically for any future legislation
 
01:22:24.550 --> 01:22:24.560 align:start position:0%
to be that specific but to be more
 
01:22:26.950 --> 01:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
generalized with informed consent
 
01:22:30.430 --> 01:22:30.440 align:start position:0%
informed consent is I would say in my
 
01:22:33.189 --> 01:22:33.199 align:start position:0%
experience uh gone the way of the dodo
 
01:22:35.790 --> 01:22:35.800 align:start position:0%
the way of the etel um I think that we
 
01:22:38.430 --> 01:22:38.440 align:start position:0%
oftentimes do not inform our patients
 
01:22:42.390 --> 01:22:42.400 align:start position:0%
well enough for instance to get a
 
01:22:44.270 --> 01:22:44.280 align:start position:0%
informed consent on the day of surgery
 
01:22:47.830 --> 01:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
to me is not informed consent I mean you
 
01:22:49.310 --> 01:22:49.320 align:start position:0%
could say to a patient I'm going to take
 
01:22:51.430 --> 01:22:51.440 align:start position:0%
your arm off and put it on your toe and
 
01:22:53.510 --> 01:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
they'll say sure I'll sign right here
 
01:22:55.790 --> 01:22:55.800 align:start position:0%
that just does not work so informed
 
01:22:58.709 --> 01:22:58.719 align:start position:0%
consent to me is a much broader issue I
 
01:23:01.149 --> 01:23:01.159 align:start position:0%
I don't and cannot support a bill that
 
01:23:03.750 --> 01:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
is so specific regarding circumcisions
 
01:23:05.510 --> 01:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
just like I couldn't be more specific
 
01:23:08.189 --> 01:23:08.199 align:start position:0%
about any other you know medication or
 
01:23:11.310 --> 01:23:11.320 align:start position:0%
treatment that we provide between a a
 
01:23:14.310 --> 01:23:14.320 align:start position:0%
parent and a child so to me any future
 
01:23:16.709 --> 01:23:16.719 align:start position:0%
legislation I would hope would have to
 
01:23:19.910 --> 01:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
do with more the informed consent versus
 
01:23:23.430 --> 01:23:23.440 align:start position:0%
the um specifics of a procedure thank
 
01:23:26.070 --> 01:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
01:23:28.390 --> 01:23:28.400 align:start position:0%
Shapero yes
 
01:23:31.030 --> 01:23:31.040 align:start position:0%
um I would hope that we recommend that
 
01:23:32.430 --> 01:23:32.440 align:start position:0%
this not be brought for further
 
01:23:36.110 --> 01:23:36.120 align:start position:0%
legislation um I I I
 
01:23:39.310 --> 01:23:39.320 align:start position:0%
absolutely um understand that informed
 
01:23:43.669 --> 01:23:43.679 align:start position:0%
consent is an issue and I cannot fathom
 
01:23:45.950 --> 01:23:45.960 align:start position:0%
the fact that it won't be brought up in
 
01:23:50.990 --> 01:23:51.000 align:start position:0%
in in other legislation coming up
 
01:23:54.950 --> 01:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
um but this bill in my mind people are
 
01:23:56.950 --> 01:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
probably sick of hearing me talk about
 
01:23:58.709 --> 01:23:58.719 align:start position:0%
this I'm sick of hearing me talk about
 
01:24:04.149 --> 01:24:04.159 align:start position:0%
this um this bill in my mind
 
01:24:07.270 --> 01:24:07.280 align:start position:0%
um while I
 
01:24:10.070 --> 01:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
understand while I understand the issue
 
01:24:13.310 --> 01:24:13.320 align:start position:0%
of people feel like they came to the
 
01:24:15.350 --> 01:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
situation where their child was going to
 
01:24:17.430 --> 01:24:17.440 align:start position:0%
be circumcised or not with without
 
01:24:19.830 --> 01:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
adequate information and there should be
 
01:24:22.470 --> 01:24:22.480 align:start position:0%
more education I support that completely
 
01:24:26.910 --> 01:24:26.920 align:start position:0%
but in my mind the the the the bill
 
01:24:28.990 --> 01:24:29.000 align:start position:0%
itself that was brought and the
 
01:24:33.149 --> 01:24:33.159 align:start position:0%
testimony we heard was so
 
01:24:40.510 --> 01:24:40.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:43.750 --> 01:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
about about people telling other people
 
01:24:45.070 --> 01:24:45.080 align:start position:0%
what they should do and what they
 
01:24:47.629 --> 01:24:47.639 align:start position:0%
shouldn't do and I don't think it's any
 
01:24:49.990 --> 01:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's the state's business
 
01:24:53.189 --> 01:24:53.199 align:start position:0%
to tell people what they should do and
 
01:24:54.870 --> 01:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
and what they shouldn't do
 
01:24:59.229 --> 01:24:59.239 align:start position:0%
do I I should take that back that's
 
01:25:03.470 --> 01:25:03.480 align:start position:0%
um in this regard I don't think I don't
 
01:25:06.590 --> 01:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
think the state has any place in making
 
01:25:10.790 --> 01:25:10.800 align:start position:0%
it in pressuring people um to make
 
01:25:12.950 --> 01:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
decisions one way or the other about
 
01:25:15.790 --> 01:25:15.800 align:start position:0%
circumcision and so I I just felt like
 
01:25:15.800 --> 01:25:18.229 align:start position:0%
circumcision and so I I just felt like
the

01:25:18.229 --> 01:25:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:21.390 --> 01:25:21.400 align:start position:0%
whole motivation that this was brought
 
01:25:25.189 --> 01:25:25.199 align:start position:0%
with um was offensive really offensive
 
01:25:29.550 --> 01:25:29.560 align:start position:0%
to me and um and so I'm certainly going
 
01:25:33.430 --> 01:25:33.440 align:start position:0%
to vote that this bill in is not brought
 
01:25:35.149 --> 01:25:35.159 align:start position:0%
this bill should not be brought forward
 
01:25:40.550 --> 01:25:40.560 align:start position:0%
in any um in any way representative Lon
 
01:25:42.629 --> 01:25:42.639 align:start position:0%
um thank you do you mind if I asked that
 
01:25:44.990 --> 01:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
you apologize for attributing motive on
 
01:25:47.109 --> 01:25:47.119 align:start position:0%
that I know that I I recognize you
 
01:25:48.830 --> 01:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
working through that but giving a motive
 
01:25:50.229 --> 01:25:50.239 align:start position:0%
to that is one of the things that we
 
01:25:57.910 --> 01:25:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:59.990 --> 01:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
um I know we've had really good
 
01:26:01.629 --> 01:26:01.639 align:start position:0%
discussions on this sort of thing before
 
01:26:03.590 --> 01:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
I just saying that say giving the motive
 
01:26:05.590 --> 01:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
in which you had offered it I think is
 
01:26:07.030 --> 01:26:07.040 align:start position:0%
just a little bit past where we should
 
01:26:08.310 --> 01:26:08.320 align:start position:0%
be but I respect everything else that
 
01:26:09.950 --> 01:26:09.960 align:start position:0%
you said you almost became a Libertarian
 
01:26:12.070 --> 01:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
there too representative
 
01:26:15.590 --> 01:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
Weber I heard it as uh describing a
 
01:26:17.669 --> 01:26:17.679 align:start position:0%
perception rather than ascribing a
 
01:26:19.870 --> 01:26:19.880 align:start position:0%
motive okay then I guess I'll withdraw
 
01:26:21.750 --> 01:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
that I just wanted to make sure we kept
 
01:26:23.070 --> 01:26:23.080 align:start position:0%
everything on really good and friendly
 
01:26:24.790 --> 01:26:24.800 align:start position:0%
terms because we've done such a good job
 
01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:26.310 align:start position:0%
terms because we've done such a good job
of

01:26:26.310 --> 01:26:26.320 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:26:29.830 --> 01:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
that representative Nal thank you Mr
 
01:26:33.629 --> 01:26:33.639 align:start position:0%
chair um I think that this gets me back
 
01:26:35.709 --> 01:26:35.719 align:start position:0%
to the pragmatic issue we had an
 
01:26:37.990 --> 01:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely wonderful discussion be on
 
01:26:40.590 --> 01:26:40.600 align:start position:0%
this issue between this bill and also
 
01:26:42.669 --> 01:26:42.679 align:start position:0%
another bill that uh representative
 
01:26:44.629 --> 01:26:44.639 align:start position:0%
kushman brought up about the whole
 
01:26:46.270 --> 01:26:46.280 align:start position:0%
concept of informed consent and it
 
01:26:48.830 --> 01:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
really touched a nerve with me and one
 
01:26:50.470 --> 01:26:50.480 align:start position:0%
of the things that I think that I said
 
01:26:53.830 --> 01:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
at the time um was that this is an issue
 
01:26:55.910 --> 01:26:55.920 align:start position:0%
that really warrants further I hate to
 
01:26:57.229 --> 01:26:57.239 align:start position:0%
do this because everybody hates it when
 
01:26:58.310 --> 01:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
you say this but further
 
01:27:00.870 --> 01:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
multi-stakeholder study on some level
 
01:27:02.790 --> 01:27:02.800 align:start position:0%
that we can actually look at this issue
 
01:27:04.229 --> 01:27:04.239 align:start position:0%
because I don't think informed consent
 
01:27:06.830 --> 01:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
works at all right now and I think it's
 
01:27:11.109 --> 01:27:11.119 align:start position:0%
important that we look at that um
 
01:27:14.070 --> 01:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
um is that a yes or a no or does it get
 
01:27:16.990 --> 01:27:17.000 align:start position:0%
back to how do we write up the report
 
01:27:19.270 --> 01:27:19.280 align:start position:0%
because I would write it up the way I
 
01:27:24.629 --> 01:27:24.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:26.430 --> 01:27:26.440 align:start position:0%
okay is that a general question yeah
 
01:27:29.270 --> 01:27:29.280 align:start position:0%
anybody you guys are way smarter than me
 
01:27:31.030 --> 01:27:31.040 align:start position:0%
I I'm not sure about in my case I'm not
 
01:27:33.830 --> 01:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
sure that about that but any other
 
01:27:35.470 --> 01:27:35.480 align:start position:0%
thoughts on representative naval's
 
01:27:39.870 --> 01:27:39.880 align:start position:0%
question or position representative
 
01:27:43.310 --> 01:27:43.320 align:start position:0%
King thank you um representative Shapiro
 
01:27:46.229 --> 01:27:46.239 align:start position:0%
brings up a interesting topic and that
 
01:27:49.470 --> 01:27:49.480 align:start position:0%
is um the fact that it was so one-sided
 
01:27:52.229 --> 01:27:52.239 align:start position:0%
during testimony and to me it seems like
 
01:27:54.550 --> 01:27:54.560 align:start position:0%
the silence is deafening
 
01:27:57.109 --> 01:27:57.119 align:start position:0%
why if I may ask the representative um
 
01:28:00.310 --> 01:28:00.320 align:start position:0%
why do you think there was no strong
 
01:28:03.590 --> 01:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
Lobby or concerned citizens or really
 
01:28:07.229 --> 01:28:07.239 align:start position:0%
anybody that came out against the bill
 
01:28:08.750 --> 01:28:08.760 align:start position:0%
why do you think there was I mean it's
 
01:28:11.550 --> 01:28:11.560 align:start position:0%
if this was really a bad idea why why
 
01:28:13.070 --> 01:28:13.080 align:start position:0%
didn't anybody come in and articulate
 
01:28:15.590 --> 01:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
that in testimony thank
 
01:28:18.629 --> 01:28:18.639 align:start position:0%
you Shapiro representative Shapiro
 
01:28:25.189 --> 01:28:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:27.390 --> 01:28:27.400 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm still kind of mulling over
 
01:28:30.030 --> 01:28:30.040 align:start position:0%
representative Leon's question of me and
 
01:28:35.870 --> 01:28:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:40.430 --> 01:28:40.440 align:start position:0%
um I'll speak for myself um you know I'm
 
01:28:44.510 --> 01:28:44.520 align:start position:0%
somebody who's 74 years old um when I'm
 
01:28:47.149 --> 01:28:47.159 align:start position:0%
Jewish so maybe that had something to do
 
01:28:51.590 --> 01:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
with why I was circumcised but also my
 
01:28:54.229 --> 01:28:54.239 align:start position:0%
age almost all men were being
 
01:28:58.669 --> 01:28:58.679 align:start position:0%
circumcised in the United States
 
01:29:03.109 --> 01:29:03.119 align:start position:0%
um a lot of the testimony involved um
 
01:29:07.550 --> 01:29:07.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:10.709 --> 01:29:10.719 align:start position:0%
um being damaged by
 
01:29:15.030 --> 01:29:15.040 align:start position:0%
circumcision um having PTSD from
 
01:29:18.910 --> 01:29:18.920 align:start position:0%
circumcision having um a rupture with
 
01:29:20.790 --> 01:29:20.800 align:start position:0%
their parents because their parents were
 
01:29:22.310 --> 01:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
the ones that made the decision to
 
01:29:25.149 --> 01:29:25.159 align:start position:0%
circumcise them her talk about people
 
01:29:30.550 --> 01:29:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:34.189 --> 01:29:34.199 align:start position:0%
um not having satisfactory sex lives
 
01:29:37.709 --> 01:29:37.719 align:start position:0%
because they were circumcised um so as
 
01:29:40.109 --> 01:29:40.119 align:start position:0%
one particular
 
01:29:43.830 --> 01:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
example those things you know I didn't
 
01:29:46.350 --> 01:29:46.360 align:start position:0%
have any of those experiences so I think
 
01:29:49.950 --> 01:29:49.960 align:start position:0%
people people the the vast majority of
 
01:29:53.070 --> 01:29:53.080 align:start position:0%
people who have had the experience of
 
01:29:53.080 --> 01:29:54.870 align:start position:0%
people who have had the experience of
circumcision

01:29:54.870 --> 01:29:54.880 align:start position:0%
circumcision
 
01:29:56.910 --> 01:29:56.920 align:start position:0%
and and I'm not saying it should happen
 
01:29:59.910 --> 01:29:59.920 align:start position:0%
or it shouldn't happen um you know if if
 
01:30:02.030 --> 01:30:02.040 align:start position:0%
I was a young parent now I don't know
 
01:30:05.470 --> 01:30:05.480 align:start position:0%
that I would circumcise a male child um
 
01:30:07.750 --> 01:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
but I think the vast majority of people
 
01:30:10.430 --> 01:30:10.440 align:start position:0%
who've had that procedure it just has
 
01:30:13.270 --> 01:30:13.280 align:start position:0%
not been a problem in their lives so you
 
01:30:14.830 --> 01:30:14.840 align:start position:0%
know there was not an outpouring of
 
01:30:18.629 --> 01:30:18.639 align:start position:0%
people coming out in defense of
 
01:30:21.590 --> 01:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
um of circumcision it's just a non
 
01:30:23.790 --> 01:30:23.800 align:start position:0%
non-issue for most people for most men I
 
01:30:23.800 --> 01:30:24.910 align:start position:0%
non-issue for most people for most men I
think

01:30:24.910 --> 01:30:24.920 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:30:27.750 --> 01:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
my perception representative Nal you
 
01:30:30.470 --> 01:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
really touched a nerve for me I this is
 
01:30:32.470 --> 01:30:32.480 align:start position:0%
the problem I have with the legislative
 
01:30:35.950 --> 01:30:35.960 align:start position:0%
process and why I like ad hoc groups um
 
01:30:38.990 --> 01:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
is that it's a you snooze you lose type
 
01:30:41.030 --> 01:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
thing you know if you're not aware that
 
01:30:42.910 --> 01:30:42.920 align:start position:0%
this is going on you're not coming here
 
01:30:44.709 --> 01:30:44.719 align:start position:0%
they came here with an organized group
 
01:30:47.590 --> 01:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
of PE a really organized group of people
 
01:30:49.430 --> 01:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
there's not an organized group of people
 
01:30:51.430 --> 01:30:51.440 align:start position:0%
out there that says I love circumcision
 
01:30:53.390 --> 01:30:53.400 align:start position:0%
you know with t-shirts and whatever you
 
01:30:55.550 --> 01:30:55.560 align:start position:0%
know it doesn't exist and so most people
 
01:30:57.270 --> 01:30:57.280 align:start position:0%
aren't even wear this ability even
 
01:31:00.109 --> 01:31:00.119 align:start position:0%
existed like when we do ad hoc groups
 
01:31:02.830 --> 01:31:02.840 align:start position:0%
what we do is we look at if you're not
 
01:31:05.310 --> 01:31:05.320 align:start position:0%
if if if you if who we look at who's not
 
01:31:07.070 --> 01:31:07.080 align:start position:0%
here and who needs to be here so that we
 
01:31:08.790 --> 01:31:08.800 align:start position:0%
have a balanced discussion on an issue
 
01:31:10.990 --> 01:31:11.000 align:start position:0%
and that frequently I think doesn't
 
01:31:12.669 --> 01:31:12.679 align:start position:0%
happen here and that's why I like that
 
01:31:15.070 --> 01:31:15.080 align:start position:0%
kind of group to solve these
 
01:31:18.229 --> 01:31:18.239 align:start position:0%
problems representative
 
01:31:20.550 --> 01:31:20.560 align:start position:0%
McKay thank you Mr
 
01:31:24.310 --> 01:31:24.320 align:start position:0%
chairman uh I have to
 
01:31:27.910 --> 01:31:27.920 align:start position:0%
admit that I was going to ask a question
 
01:31:27.920 --> 01:31:29.430 align:start position:0%
admit that I was going to ask a question
about

01:31:29.430 --> 01:31:29.440 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:31:33.709 --> 01:31:33.719 align:start position:0%
motivation and I do have some concerns
 
01:31:35.830 --> 01:31:35.840 align:start position:0%
about why we're
 
01:31:39.590 --> 01:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
only asking questions about
 
01:31:42.030 --> 01:31:42.040 align:start position:0%
circumcision uh but I won't ask that
 
01:31:46.510 --> 01:31:46.520 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:31:46.520 --> 01:31:48.750 align:start position:0%

other
 
01:31:51.870 --> 01:31:51.880 align:start position:0%
comments seeing none let's move on to
 
01:31:54.470 --> 01:31:54.480 align:start position:0%

thoughts seeing
 
01:32:06.470 --> 01:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
none okay moving on uh to SB 458
 
01:32:08.709 --> 01:32:08.719 align:start position:0%
relative to the dispensing of certain

one no
 
01:32:17.709 --> 01:32:17.719 align:start position:0%
okay and finally and I know
 
01:32:20.350 --> 01:32:20.360 align:start position:0%
representative McAn had a chair the
 
01:32:22.310 --> 01:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
subcommittee on this final
 
01:32:25.910 --> 01:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
one SB 95 relative to certification of
 
01:32:28.270 --> 01:32:28.280 align:start position:0%
Alcohol and Other Drug use treatment
 
01:32:30.270 --> 01:32:30.280 align:start position:0%
facilities I know we had at least one
 
01:32:33.510 --> 01:32:33.520 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting I I sat in on it um
 
01:32:35.109 --> 01:32:35.119 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately he can't be with us
 
01:32:36.629 --> 01:32:36.639 align:start position:0%
this morning he will be here this
 
01:32:38.950 --> 01:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
afternoon the executive session
 
01:32:38.960 --> 01:32:40.070 align:start position:0%
afternoon the executive session
representative

01:32:40.070 --> 01:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:32:43.790 --> 01:32:43.800 align:start position:0%
Shapiro yes um representative Weber and
 
01:32:45.709 --> 01:32:45.719 align:start position:0%
myself participated in those
 
01:32:49.470 --> 01:32:49.480 align:start position:0%
subcommittees and I think um can tell me
 
01:32:51.270 --> 01:32:51.280 align:start position:0%
if I've got this wrong but I think there
 
01:32:54.430 --> 01:32:54.440 align:start position:0%
was you know
 
01:32:55.669 --> 01:32:55.679 align:start position:0%
a general
 
01:32:59.109 --> 01:32:59.119 align:start position:0%
consensus that there was a usefulness
 
01:33:03.709 --> 01:33:03.719 align:start position:0%
that would come out of um certification
 
01:33:03.719 --> 01:33:05.550 align:start position:0%
that would come out of um certification
of

01:33:05.550 --> 01:33:05.560 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:33:08.629 --> 01:33:08.639 align:start position:0%
um certain substance use disorder
 
01:33:11.390 --> 01:33:11.400 align:start position:0%
programs that are currently not overseen
 
01:33:18.109 --> 01:33:18.119 align:start position:0%
by um any um by DHHS in any way and um I
 
01:33:20.870 --> 01:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
think those we kind of narrowed when we
 
01:33:22.390 --> 01:33:22.400 align:start position:0%
first had the hearing it was very
 
01:33:25.350 --> 01:33:25.360 align:start position:0%
confusing about what kind of
 
01:33:28.109 --> 01:33:28.119 align:start position:0%
um facilities we were talking about what
 
01:33:30.189 --> 01:33:30.199 align:start position:0%
kind of programs we were talking
 
01:33:35.870 --> 01:33:35.880 align:start position:0%
about and um and in fact um the news
 
01:33:37.790 --> 01:33:37.800 align:start position:0%
reports that had stirred us to bring
 
01:33:39.950 --> 01:33:39.960 align:start position:0%
this bill happened in a residential
 
01:33:42.149 --> 01:33:42.159 align:start position:0%
program and there already is oversight
 
01:33:45.030 --> 01:33:45.040 align:start position:0%
over residential program so it was very
 
01:33:47.070 --> 01:33:47.080 align:start position:0%
confusing um but I think in our
 
01:33:50.070 --> 01:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
subcommittee work we decided that it
 
01:33:52.430 --> 01:33:52.440 align:start position:0%
would be useful to have some level of
 
01:33:52.440 --> 01:33:54.070 align:start position:0%
would be useful to have some level of
certification

01:33:54.070 --> 01:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
certification
 
01:33:56.990 --> 01:33:57.000 align:start position:0%
of um I think they were broadly
 
01:34:00.590 --> 01:34:00.600 align:start position:0%
called out outpatient um substance use
 
01:34:04.510 --> 01:34:04.520 align:start position:0%
disorder programs which includes um day
 
01:34:06.669 --> 01:34:06.679 align:start position:0%
treatment intensive day treatment
 
01:34:10.629 --> 01:34:10.639 align:start position:0%
programs such as this and um
 
01:34:13.270 --> 01:34:13.280 align:start position:0%
representative mlan was pursuing getting
 
01:34:15.510 --> 01:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
more specific language written but I
 
01:34:17.990 --> 01:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
don't we didn't you know we agreed to
 
01:34:23.910 --> 01:34:23.920 align:start position:0%
vote on um suggesting that this bill um
 
01:34:25.830 --> 01:34:25.840 align:start position:0%
be approved for further legislation
 
01:34:28.189 --> 01:34:28.199 align:start position:0%
before we saw in the specific language
 
01:34:31.070 --> 01:34:31.080 align:start position:0%
so um I think it was the consensus of
 
01:34:33.950 --> 01:34:33.960 align:start position:0%
the group that it was a good idea to
 
01:34:36.510 --> 01:34:36.520 align:start position:0%
um recommend further
 
01:34:39.830 --> 01:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
legislation representative Weber and I
 
01:34:41.709 --> 01:34:41.719 align:start position:0%
would agree with all of that and I think
 
01:34:44.550 --> 01:34:44.560 align:start position:0%
that what this is an example of one
 
01:34:46.910 --> 01:34:46.920 align:start position:0%
where we did actually make some progress
 
01:34:49.669 --> 01:34:49.679 align:start position:0%
in the drafting it wasn't ready to go
 
01:34:52.189 --> 01:34:52.199 align:start position:0%
and of course it has to be as we have
 
01:34:54.669 --> 01:34:54.679 align:start position:0%
noted introduced in the next
 
01:34:56.950 --> 01:34:56.960 align:start position:0%
legislature but
 
01:35:01.669 --> 01:35:01.679 align:start position:0%
um the bill as it came to us had
 
01:35:04.669 --> 01:35:04.679 align:start position:0%
significant drafting issues in it and we
 
01:35:07.550 --> 01:35:07.560 align:start position:0%
had significant issues of understanding
 
01:35:09.310 --> 01:35:09.320 align:start position:0%
exactly what the aims were and what it
 
01:35:11.990 --> 01:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
was going to cover and in this case I
 
01:35:14.510 --> 01:35:14.520 align:start position:0%
think we came to a considerable amount
 
01:35:14.520 --> 01:35:15.470 align:start position:0%
think we came to a considerable amount
more

01:35:15.470 --> 01:35:15.480 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:35:17.709 --> 01:35:17.719 align:start position:0%
clarity um
 
01:35:21.109 --> 01:35:21.119 align:start position:0%
and uh the other part of the discussion
 
01:35:22.669 --> 01:35:22.679 align:start position:0%
and I'm sorry that representative
 
01:35:24.590 --> 01:35:24.600 align:start position:0%
Merchant couldn't be with us today but
 
01:35:29.950 --> 01:35:29.960 align:start position:0%
he's um otherwise engaged was that um
 
01:35:32.750 --> 01:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
there was the issue
 
01:35:37.189 --> 01:35:37.199 align:start position:0%
of certification of Staff members versus
 
01:35:39.310 --> 01:35:39.320 align:start position:0%
certification of a
 
01:35:45.229 --> 01:35:45.239 align:start position:0%
facility and the concerns that we had
 
01:35:49.149 --> 01:35:49.159 align:start position:0%
were if you only rely on the
 
01:35:51.669 --> 01:35:51.679 align:start position:0%
certification of Staff
 
01:35:55.189 --> 01:35:55.199 align:start position:0%
members um it's possible that the staff
 
01:35:56.669 --> 01:35:56.679 align:start position:0%
members go down the line but the
 
01:35:58.430 --> 01:35:58.440 align:start position:0%
facility hires somebody else and the
 
01:36:00.109 --> 01:36:00.119 align:start position:0%
problem occurs again and again and again
 
01:36:04.430 --> 01:36:04.440 align:start position:0%
because the the um facility has a
 
01:36:08.870 --> 01:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
particular bent that is perhaps not as
 
01:36:11.669 --> 01:36:11.679 align:start position:0%
appropriate and the concern I think for
 
01:36:14.870 --> 01:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
all of us is that the people who are
 
01:36:16.830 --> 01:36:16.840 align:start position:0%
being treated at these facilities are at
 
01:36:20.310 --> 01:36:20.320 align:start position:0%
a particular vulnerable spot in their
 
01:36:24.189 --> 01:36:24.199 align:start position:0%
lives and we want to be sure that the
 
01:36:28.709 --> 01:36:28.719 align:start position:0%
care that they are getting is optimal so
 
01:36:30.830 --> 01:36:30.840 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro I think in the
 
01:36:35.430 --> 01:36:35.440 align:start position:0%
end um in the initial um in the initial
 
01:36:37.990 --> 01:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
hearings that we had in this committee
 
01:36:40.270 --> 01:36:40.280 align:start position:0%
there was some discussion about um the
 
01:36:42.910 --> 01:36:42.920 align:start position:0%
facility itself like the building and I
 
01:36:45.149 --> 01:36:45.159 align:start position:0%
think we kind of narrow it in on we're
 
01:36:46.990 --> 01:36:47.000 align:start position:0%
not talking about the licensed
 
01:36:48.629 --> 01:36:48.639 align:start position:0%
clinicians because there's already
 
01:36:50.590 --> 01:36:50.600 align:start position:0%
oversight over them and we're not
 
01:36:53.629 --> 01:36:53.639 align:start position:0%
talking about the facility necessarily
 
01:36:55.669 --> 01:36:55.679 align:start position:0%
but we're really talking about the
 
01:37:01.430 --> 01:37:01.440 align:start position:0%
program um so um and and and we we did
 
01:37:05.310 --> 01:37:05.320 align:start position:0%
not want to kind of have oversight
 
01:37:07.910 --> 01:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
narrow the scope of the program because
 
01:37:11.030 --> 01:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
we know there's a lot of different um
 
01:37:13.229 --> 01:37:13.239 align:start position:0%
views on what makes a good substance use
 
01:37:15.270 --> 01:37:15.280 align:start position:0%
disorder program there's all kinds of
 
01:37:17.590 --> 01:37:17.600 align:start position:0%
models that have been used some of them
 
01:37:17.600 --> 01:37:18.390 align:start position:0%
models that have been used some of them
now

01:37:18.390 --> 01:37:18.400 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:37:20.590 --> 01:37:20.600 align:start position:0%
discredited um but certainly there's not
 
01:37:22.590 --> 01:37:22.600 align:start position:0%
full agreement about what the right way
 
01:37:24.470 --> 01:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
is to treat someone with a substance use
 
01:37:28.189 --> 01:37:28.199 align:start position:0%
disorder so we wanted to we wanted when
 
01:37:32.149 --> 01:37:32.159 align:start position:0%
this eventually happens to allow for
 
01:37:35.390 --> 01:37:35.400 align:start position:0%
Innovation and allow for um
 
01:37:38.870 --> 01:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
variation um but to have some oversight
 
01:37:38.880 --> 01:37:39.680 align:start position:0%
variation um but to have some oversight
on

01:37:39.680 --> 01:37:39.690 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:37:39.690 --> 01:37:41.430 align:start position:0%

01:37:47.870 --> 01:37:47.880 align:start position:0%
efficacy and and and efficacy and
 
01:37:50.470 --> 01:37:50.480 align:start position:0%
ethical considerations within that
 
01:37:53.229 --> 01:37:53.239 align:start position:0%
program thank you and can I just say one
 
01:37:55.709 --> 01:37:55.719 align:start position:0%
more sure which is I want I want to give
 
01:37:57.589 --> 01:37:57.599 align:start position:0%
representative mlan even though he's not
 
01:38:00.910 --> 01:38:00.920 align:start position:0%
here um my appreciation for pursuing
 
01:38:04.310 --> 01:38:04.320 align:start position:0%
this because it's kind of a dry subject
 
01:38:06.550 --> 01:38:06.560 align:start position:0%
and I think he had mixed feelings I
 
01:38:08.709 --> 01:38:08.719 align:start position:0%
think he
 
01:38:11.350 --> 01:38:11.360 align:start position:0%
um I think he didn't feel so positive
 
01:38:13.950 --> 01:38:13.960 align:start position:0%
about it then some but then some people
 
01:38:16.430 --> 01:38:16.440 align:start position:0%
his constituencies thought it was a a
 
01:38:19.589 --> 01:38:19.599 align:start position:0%
needed idea and he um really did a very
 
01:38:21.830 --> 01:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
very good job of chairing the committee
 
01:38:24.030 --> 01:38:24.040 align:start position:0%
and um gathering information
 
01:38:26.510 --> 01:38:26.520 align:start position:0%
and um encouraging people to come to
 
01:38:29.070 --> 01:38:29.080 align:start position:0%
talk about it so I give him a lot of
 
01:38:30.830 --> 01:38:30.840 align:start position:0%
credit thank
 
01:38:35.310 --> 01:38:35.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:38.709 --> 01:38:38.719 align:start position:0%
thoughts okay I'm seeing none all right
 
01:38:40.669 --> 01:38:40.679 align:start position:0%
that that concludes all of the bills
 
01:38:42.589 --> 01:38:42.599 align:start position:0%
that we're going to be considering this
 
01:38:45.550 --> 01:38:45.560 align:start position:0%
afternoon um any final thoughts oh yes
 
01:38:47.629 --> 01:38:47.639 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy uh just a question
 
01:38:50.470 --> 01:38:50.480 align:start position:0%
maybe your request um when we meet this
 
01:38:53.709 --> 01:38:53.719 align:start position:0%
afternoon to exact these bills at 1 o'
 
01:38:56.870 --> 01:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
is it possible to have um in in
 
01:38:58.310 --> 01:38:58.320 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro's comments made
 
01:39:00.709 --> 01:39:00.719 align:start position:0%
me think of this was were any of the
 
01:39:02.589 --> 01:39:02.599 align:start position:0%
bills acted upon during the summertime
 
01:39:04.189 --> 01:39:04.199 align:start position:0%
was there a subcommittee was there a
 
01:39:06.830 --> 01:39:06.840 align:start position:0%
recommendation if so what was it uh at
 
01:39:08.470 --> 01:39:08.480 align:start position:0%
the beginning so that you know we can
 
01:39:10.189 --> 01:39:10.199 align:start position:0%
table set the very beginning of every
 
01:39:12.470 --> 01:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
discussion that they did or did not have
 
01:39:14.990 --> 01:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
a subcommittee meeting and if so what
 
01:39:16.430 --> 01:39:16.440 align:start position:0%
were the outcomes what were the
 
01:39:18.510 --> 01:39:18.520 align:start position:0%
recommendations made at the time sure
 
01:39:19.589 --> 01:39:19.599 align:start position:0%
there are only two functioning
 
01:39:21.830 --> 01:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
subcommittees uh again that was on HP
 
01:39:27.830 --> 01:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
554 FN and SB 495 unfortunately okay
 
01:39:29.709 --> 01:39:29.719 align:start position:0%
that's what I thought because that's
 
01:39:32.910 --> 01:39:32.920 align:start position:0%
what I heard you know but um I was part
 
01:39:35.310 --> 01:39:35.320 align:start position:0%
of 554 I don't know if I was a true
 
01:39:38.350 --> 01:39:38.360 align:start position:0%
member or I just kind of sat in and made
 
01:39:41.950 --> 01:39:41.960 align:start position:0%
chair I don't know whatever uh I know
 
01:39:43.669 --> 01:39:43.679 align:start position:0%
what the recommendations out of that
 
01:39:46.390 --> 01:39:46.400 align:start position:0%
were and what the changes were so I
 
01:39:48.189 --> 01:39:48.199 align:start position:0%
appreciate that that those are the only
 
01:39:50.109 --> 01:39:50.119 align:start position:0%
two that people wanted to enjoy their
 
01:39:51.470 --> 01:39:51.480 align:start position:0%
summer they didn't want to be doing this
 
01:39:55.030 --> 01:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
stuff gotcha I understand that thank you

I'm
 
01:40:12.550 --> 01:40:12.560 align:start position:0%
thinking uh and I I just wanted to
 
01:40:15.430 --> 01:40:15.440 align:start position:0%
comment on the
 
01:40:19.350 --> 01:40:19.360 align:start position:0%
individuals uh who decided not to come
 
01:40:22.070 --> 01:40:22.080 align:start position:0%
back uh and I'm very appreciative of
 
01:40:25.790 --> 01:40:25.800 align:start position:0%
those who decided to come back but it's
 
01:40:29.629 --> 01:40:29.639 align:start position:0%
going to be a great loss to this uh
 
01:40:33.310 --> 01:40:33.320 align:start position:0%
committee uh for some of the people who
 
01:40:37.990 --> 01:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
become close friends uh over the session
 
01:40:41.270 --> 01:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
uh so I just wanted to comment and I'm
 
01:40:44.030 --> 01:40:44.040 align:start position:0%
kind of looking at the ones
 
01:40:49.070 --> 01:40:49.080 align:start position:0%
that are extremely important to me um
 
01:40:52.510 --> 01:40:52.520 align:start position:0%
and wanted to thank them for what they
 
01:40:53.230 --> 01:40:53.240 align:start position:0%
have done
 
01:40:53.240 --> 01:40:54.310 align:start position:0%
have done
[Music]

01:40:54.310 --> 01:40:54.320 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:40:58.390 --> 01:40:58.400 align:start position:0%
and encourage them as one of them said I
 
01:41:02.149 --> 01:41:02.159 align:start position:0%
may be over there that's not a threat
 
01:41:05.910 --> 01:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
that that that's a a wonderful thing
 
01:41:10.270 --> 01:41:10.280 align:start position:0%
that people can do and Joe is one of the
 
01:41:14.350 --> 01:41:14.360 align:start position:0%
last social workers left uh so I'm
 
01:41:18.350 --> 01:41:18.360 align:start position:0%
hoping that we can replace that person
 
01:41:21.550 --> 01:41:21.560 align:start position:0%
but I felt it was very important having
 
01:41:24.189 --> 01:41:24.199 align:start position:0%
served on this committee for a very long
 
01:41:28.109 --> 01:41:28.119 align:start position:0%
time that this is one of the best
 
01:41:31.550 --> 01:41:31.560 align:start position:0%
committees and I want to thank the chair

legislation representative Weber
 
03:39:46.790 --> 03:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
recommend for future legislation is
 
03:39:49.510 --> 03:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:52.389 --> 03:39:52.399 align:start position:0%
second representative Shapiro

to speak to your motion I simply think
 
03:39:56.640 --> 03:39:58.110 align:start position:0%
to speak to your motion I simply think
that

03:39:58.110 --> 03:39:58.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:40:01.229 --> 03:40:01.239 align:start position:0%
um an answer prevention is worth a pound
 
03:40:06.670 --> 03:40:06.680 align:start position:0%
of cure that um setting up a program and
 
03:40:08.670 --> 03:40:08.680 align:start position:0%
getting it instituted so kids get
 
03:40:12.110 --> 03:40:12.120 align:start position:0%
checked early and interventions if
 
03:40:15.910 --> 03:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
needed are started early is always a
 
03:40:18.590 --> 03:40:18.600 align:start position:0%
good thing and tends to save a
 
03:40:20.389 --> 03:40:20.399 align:start position:0%
significant amount of dollars in the
 
03:40:23.990 --> 03:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
long run as well as um changing people's
 
03:40:24.000 --> 03:40:25.150 align:start position:0%
long run as well as um changing people's
lives

03:40:25.150 --> 03:40:25.160 align:start position:0%
lives
 
03:40:29.070 --> 03:40:29.080 align:start position:0%
so thank you any other
 
03:40:31.510 --> 03:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Lon uh thank
 
03:40:34.030 --> 03:40:34.040 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman I would like to uh note
 
03:40:35.590 --> 03:40:35.600 align:start position:0%
that the reason this went to interim
 
03:40:37.590 --> 03:40:37.600 align:start position:0%
study is because there still were many
 
03:40:39.389 --> 03:40:39.399 align:start position:0%
many things that were uncertain given
 
03:40:41.429 --> 03:40:41.439 align:start position:0%
the language of this bill um and my
 
03:40:42.910 --> 03:40:42.920 align:start position:0%
question is whether or not this is
 
03:40:44.870 --> 03:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
recommending sort of notionally of this
 
03:40:47.710 --> 03:40:47.720 align:start position:0%
General idea for future legislation or
 
03:40:50.030 --> 03:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
to build it as a model off of this um
 
03:40:51.309 --> 03:40:51.319 align:start position:0%
this existing
 
03:40:53.870 --> 03:40:53.880 align:start position:0%
bill I would definitely say that it was
 
03:40:56.990 --> 03:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
the former it was the um concept rather
 
03:40:59.429 --> 03:40:59.439 align:start position:0%
than having this bill be the
 
03:41:02.229 --> 03:41:02.239 align:start position:0%
model um okay so I'm trying to figure
 
03:41:05.790 --> 03:41:05.800 align:start position:0%
out where I am okay um thank
 
03:41:08.870 --> 03:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
you other
 
03:41:12.389 --> 03:41:12.399 align:start position:0%
discussion representative L on um yes I
 
03:41:15.030 --> 03:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
the largest part within this um is some
 
03:41:16.950 --> 03:41:16.960 align:start position:0%
of the those details do matter to me a
 
03:41:18.469 --> 03:41:18.479 align:start position:0%
lot if we're looking at setting up more
 
03:41:20.229 --> 03:41:20.239 align:start position:0%
clinics within our schools we're
 
03:41:21.950 --> 03:41:21.960 align:start position:0%
bringing more and more opportunities
 
03:41:23.349 --> 03:41:23.359 align:start position:0%
where we're sort of blending the
 
03:41:24.990 --> 03:41:25.000 align:start position:0%
education Mission with the healthcare
 
03:41:26.750 --> 03:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
Mission I know there's been a larger
 
03:41:28.670 --> 03:41:28.680 align:start position:0%
move towards that and there's so many
 
03:41:30.990 --> 03:41:31.000 align:start position:0%
different open-ended questions that
 
03:41:33.389 --> 03:41:33.399 align:start position:0%
while I agree that in that we need to
 
03:41:35.429 --> 03:41:35.439 align:start position:0%
make sure that children can see and that
 
03:41:38.189 --> 03:41:38.199 align:start position:0%
there's a method to do so um the the
 
03:41:40.149 --> 03:41:40.159 align:start position:0%
process of expecting everything to fall
 
03:41:42.910 --> 03:41:42.920 align:start position:0%
within the Medicaid Program U or within
 
03:41:44.790 --> 03:41:44.800 align:start position:0%
the school program um there's some
 
03:41:46.750 --> 03:41:46.760 align:start position:0%
fundamental questions I have with how to
 
03:41:49.110 --> 03:41:49.120 align:start position:0%
execute that and while I support all
 
03:41:50.790 --> 03:41:50.800 align:start position:0%
children being able to see and getting
 
03:41:53.870 --> 03:41:53.880 align:start position:0%
the Vision Care they need um even the
 
03:41:55.429 --> 03:41:55.439 align:start position:0%
direction of doing this through Medicaid
 
03:41:57.550 --> 03:41:57.560 align:start position:0%
and tying it to school attendance raises
 
03:41:59.469 --> 03:41:59.479 align:start position:0%
significant concerns to me so while I
 
03:42:01.750 --> 03:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
support all children being able to see
 
03:42:03.309 --> 03:42:03.319 align:start position:0%
um even moving forward off of this
 
03:42:06.830 --> 03:42:06.840 align:start position:0%
notional one presents problems to
 
03:42:09.910 --> 03:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
me other
 
03:42:11.950 --> 03:42:11.960 align:start position:0%

redesign of the Bureau for developmental
 
03:46:30.550 --> 03:46:30.560 align:start position:0%
Services it was retained by the
 
03:46:32.309 --> 03:46:32.319 align:start position:0%
committee to continue the discussion
 
03:46:33.910 --> 03:46:33.920 align:start position:0%
surrounding the implementation of the
 
03:46:35.630 --> 03:46:35.640 align:start position:0%
redesign and we met both in the spring
 
03:46:38.550 --> 03:46:38.560 align:start position:0%
and fall of 2023 stakeholders were able
 
03:46:40.149 --> 03:46:40.159 align:start position:0%
to come together and while we
 
03:46:42.110 --> 03:46:42.120 align:start position:0%
recommended this for interim study to
 
03:46:44.389 --> 03:46:44.399 align:start position:0%
keep the Forum alive it was not needed
 
03:46:46.630 --> 03:46:46.640 align:start position:0%
um the process worked and future
 
03:46:49.070 --> 03:46:49.080 align:start position:0%
legislation is not
 
03:46:52.189 --> 03:46:52.199 align:start position:0%
needed any other
 
03:46:54.870 --> 03:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
discussion okay I'm saying
 
03:46:57.670 --> 03:46:57.680 align:start position:0%

03:48:25.910 --> 03:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
motion representative L I'll move
 
03:48:27.469 --> 03:48:27.479 align:start position:0%
recommended for future
 
03:48:30.950 --> 03:48:30.960 align:start position:0%

second representative kofalt
 
03:48:36.910 --> 03:48:36.920 align:start position:0%
representative kofalt seconds the motion
 
03:48:38.550 --> 03:48:38.560 align:start position:0%
to recommend for future legislation do
 
03:48:40.309 --> 03:48:40.319 align:start position:0%
you wish to speak to your motion uh yes
 
03:48:42.670 --> 03:48:42.680 align:start position:0%
thank you uh this bill sought to remove
 
03:48:44.269 --> 03:48:44.279 align:start position:0%
barriers to midwives attending home
 
03:48:46.790 --> 03:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
births um by setting some guard rails on
 
03:48:48.750 --> 03:48:48.760 align:start position:0%
what and what wasn't permitted within
 
03:48:51.149 --> 03:48:51.159 align:start position:0%
the administrative rules surrounding um
 
03:48:53.469 --> 03:48:53.479 align:start position:0%
the scope of practice for midwives um I
 
03:48:55.070 --> 03:48:55.080 align:start position:0%
think further discussion needs to happen
 
03:48:57.349 --> 03:48:57.359 align:start position:0%
in order to balance the risks and the
 
03:48:59.229 --> 03:48:59.239 align:start position:0%
opportunities however we do need to
 
03:49:00.870 --> 03:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
recognize that we're looking at the
 
03:49:02.950 --> 03:49:02.960 align:start position:0%
potential of um having more and more
 
03:49:04.830 --> 03:49:04.840 align:start position:0%
unattended home births if we're not able
 
03:49:07.510 --> 03:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
to accommodate U mothers whose wishes
 
03:49:09.910 --> 03:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
cannot be accommodated either with a
 
03:49:11.950 --> 03:49:11.960 align:start position:0%
certified midwife or in the hospital
 
03:49:13.790 --> 03:49:13.800 align:start position:0%
setting and where they may be going out
 
03:49:15.630 --> 03:49:15.640 align:start position:0%
of state to neighboring states like
 
03:49:17.429 --> 03:49:17.439 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts where some of these are
 
03:49:19.189 --> 03:49:19.199 align:start position:0%
permitted by their equivalent of
 
03:49:21.870 --> 03:49:21.880 align:start position:0%
certified midwives um while I recognize
 
03:49:24.189 --> 03:49:24.199 align:start position:0%
that there were s there were various
 
03:49:26.429 --> 03:49:26.439 align:start position:0%
concerns about the implementation and
 
03:49:28.189 --> 03:49:28.199 align:start position:0%
how it was done um that's why we would
 
03:49:30.750 --> 03:49:30.760 align:start position:0%
leave to a future legisl legislature how
 
03:49:34.630 --> 03:49:34.640 align:start position:0%
better to um how better to accommodate
 
03:49:37.149 --> 03:49:37.159 align:start position:0%
the risk preferences of different
 
03:49:40.030 --> 03:49:40.040 align:start position:0%
parents other discussion representative
 
03:49:43.110 --> 03:49:43.120 align:start position:0%
Shapiro yes thank you well well I think
 
03:49:48.950 --> 03:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
there's um Merit in um providing as um
 
03:49:52.469 --> 03:49:52.479 align:start position:0%
many options as possible for people to
 
03:49:56.870 --> 03:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
um decide on their own risk tolerance um
 
03:49:59.990 --> 03:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
and while I also think that there are
 
03:50:03.030 --> 03:50:03.040 align:start position:0%
merits to the arguments
 
03:50:06.110 --> 03:50:06.120 align:start position:0%
um from a lot of the more medically
 
03:50:08.309 --> 03:50:08.319 align:start position:0%
oriented people on on this committee
 
03:50:12.309 --> 03:50:12.319 align:start position:0%
that um these not might be very unsafe
 
03:50:14.910 --> 03:50:14.920 align:start position:0%
for me the the determining Factor is
 
03:50:20.510 --> 03:50:20.520 align:start position:0%
really that um in legislation we are
 
03:50:24.269 --> 03:50:24.279 align:start position:0%
um we are saying that the the
 
03:50:27.550 --> 03:50:27.560 align:start position:0%
the Midwifery Council which is the very
 
03:50:31.790 --> 03:50:31.800 align:start position:0%
Council that is tasked with um providing
 
03:50:34.309 --> 03:50:34.319 align:start position:0%
um the scope of practice then we are
 
03:50:35.870 --> 03:50:35.880 align:start position:0%
turning around and telling them what
 
03:50:37.910 --> 03:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
they can do and what they can't do and
 
03:50:41.389 --> 03:50:41.399 align:start position:0%
so for that reason alone I would vote um
 
03:50:45.349 --> 03:50:45.359 align:start position:0%
against recommending it for future um
 
03:50:47.030 --> 03:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
for future
 
03:50:51.269 --> 03:50:51.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:53.309 --> 03:50:53.319 align:start position:0%
discussion another
 
03:50:55.870 --> 03:50:55.880 align:start position:0%
discussion okay Mr clerk I'm sorry
 
03:50:59.790 --> 03:50:59.800 align:start position:0%
representative King thank you Mr chair
 
03:51:02.790 --> 03:51:02.800 align:start position:0%
um to address representative Shapiro's
 
03:51:04.389 --> 03:51:04.399 align:start position:0%
concerns I think
 
03:51:07.830 --> 03:51:07.840 align:start position:0%
that councils like the Midwifery Council
 
03:51:10.110 --> 03:51:10.120 align:start position:0%
they know that they're in a tough
 
03:51:13.750 --> 03:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
position because on the one hand they
 
03:51:15.950 --> 03:51:15.960 align:start position:0%
want to promote Midwifery they believe
 
03:51:19.710 --> 03:51:19.720 align:start position:0%
in the practice but they also know that
 
03:51:23.990 --> 03:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
if anything bad happens that they're
 
03:51:26.269 --> 03:51:26.279 align:start position:0%
going it's going to look bad for them
 
03:51:28.950 --> 03:51:28.960 align:start position:0%
and it could result in negative
 
03:51:31.710 --> 03:51:31.720 align:start position:0%
legislation against Midwifery so they
 
03:51:33.790 --> 03:51:33.800 align:start position:0%
they're maybe in a position where they
 
03:51:35.550 --> 03:51:35.560 align:start position:0%
feel they have to be more conservative
 
03:51:37.910 --> 03:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
than they otherwise would be I think if
 
03:51:40.030 --> 03:51:40.040 align:start position:0%
they if they have their DRS they
 
03:51:40.040 --> 03:51:41.309 align:start position:0%
they if they have their DRS they
probably

03:51:41.309 --> 03:51:41.319 align:start position:0%
probably
 
03:51:43.630 --> 03:51:43.640 align:start position:0%
support the provisions in this
 
03:51:43.640 --> 03:51:45.070 align:start position:0%
support the provisions in this
legislation

03:51:45.070 --> 03:51:45.080 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
03:51:48.110 --> 03:51:48.120 align:start position:0%
but they can't do it themselves because
 
03:51:50.309 --> 03:51:50.319 align:start position:0%
of the consequences that could come from
 
03:51:53.070 --> 03:51:53.080 align:start position:0%
it whereas we the legislator Branch who
 
03:51:55.469 --> 03:51:55.479 align:start position:0%
has the ultimate authority over these
 
03:51:59.429 --> 03:51:59.439 align:start position:0%
councils um and ultimately the law um we
 
03:52:02.269 --> 03:52:02.279 align:start position:0%
can we can let's just say be less
 
03:52:05.670 --> 03:52:05.680 align:start position:0%
conservative so that's uh to address
 
03:52:08.189 --> 03:52:08.199 align:start position:0%
your concern for me the reason why I'm
 
03:52:11.149 --> 03:52:11.159 align:start position:0%
supporting this is because um I just
 
03:52:15.189 --> 03:52:15.199 align:start position:0%
find it to be um in congruous as I as I
 
03:52:18.950 --> 03:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
said in the work session that um people
 
03:52:21.149 --> 03:52:21.159 align:start position:0%
have a legal authority to terminate
 
03:52:23.750 --> 03:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
intentionally a pregnancy but to not
 
03:52:25.149 --> 03:52:25.159 align:start position:0%
have access
 
03:52:28.590 --> 03:52:28.600 align:start position:0%
to Midwifery um that doesn't make any
 
03:52:33.269 --> 03:52:33.279 align:start position:0%
sense to me whatsoever um and then last
 
03:52:36.910 --> 03:52:36.920 align:start position:0%
um you know I'm a California Refugee and
 
03:52:38.149 --> 03:52:38.159 align:start position:0%
uh when I moved to the state of New
 
03:52:40.510 --> 03:52:40.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I met a a lady who is also
 
03:52:44.149 --> 03:52:44.159 align:start position:0%
from California and um she was a midwife
 
03:52:48.950 --> 03:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
and she was a felon because she she was
 
03:52:50.990 --> 03:52:51.000 align:start position:0%
in the room she wasn't the one
 
03:52:52.510 --> 03:52:52.520 align:start position:0%
delivering the baby but she was in the
 
03:52:54.950 --> 03:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
room and during the process she touched
 
03:52:56.389 --> 03:52:56.399 align:start position:0%
the baby and that was enough to make her
 
03:52:58.469 --> 03:52:58.479 align:start position:0%
a felon in the state of California so I
 
03:52:59.750 --> 03:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
don't know what the penalties would be
 
03:53:03.590 --> 03:53:03.600 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire but we have a situation
 
03:53:05.389 --> 03:53:05.399 align:start position:0%
where a person could be giving birth
 
03:53:07.870 --> 03:53:07.880 align:start position:0%
outside of a hospital and somebody who's
 
03:53:10.870 --> 03:53:10.880 align:start position:0%
just a random person not involved with
 
03:53:13.229 --> 03:53:13.239 align:start position:0%
Midwifery would potentially have the
 
03:53:16.469 --> 03:53:16.479 align:start position:0%
legal ability to deliver that baby but
 
03:53:18.349 --> 03:53:18.359 align:start position:0%
somebody who's professionally a
 
03:53:20.750 --> 03:53:20.760 align:start position:0%
midwife might not have the legal ability
 
03:53:22.510 --> 03:53:22.520 align:start position:0%
to deliver that baby that also doesn't
 
03:53:26.070 --> 03:53:26.080 align:start position:0%
make any sense so um to me I like the
 
03:53:29.070 --> 03:53:29.080 align:start position:0%
idea of decriminalizing people from
 
03:53:31.269 --> 03:53:31.279 align:start position:0%
doing something that our ancestors have
 
03:53:32.790 --> 03:53:32.800 align:start position:0%
done for thousands of years without
 
03:53:35.830 --> 03:53:35.840 align:start position:0%
legal repercussions so we need to end
 
03:53:38.429 --> 03:53:38.439 align:start position:0%
the one mid rerey thank
 
03:53:42.030 --> 03:53:42.040 align:start position:0%
you representative Nel um I just wanted
 
03:53:43.630 --> 03:53:43.640 align:start position:0%
to point out that I believe there's
 
03:53:45.110 --> 03:53:45.120 align:start position:0%
substantially better better ways to
 
03:53:47.110 --> 03:53:47.120 align:start position:0%
address the obstetrical crisis in this
 
03:53:48.269 --> 03:53:48.279 align:start position:0%
state than
 
03:53:53.790 --> 03:53:53.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:56.030 --> 03:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
discussion none I'll ask the CLK to call
 
03:53:56.040 --> 03:53:57.030 align:start position:0%
discussion none I'll ask the CLK to call
the

03:53:57.030 --> 03:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:53:59.510 --> 03:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
rooll motion before us is recommendation

barriers to ster sterilization treatment
 
03:55:35.910 --> 03:55:35.920 align:start position:0%
for Consulting consenting adults and to
 
03:55:37.670 --> 03:55:37.680 align:start position:0%

physician concern about their future

reproductive wishes additionally through
 
03:55:51.910 --> 03:55:51.920 align:start position:0%
this bill and others it's become
 
03:55:53.670 --> 03:55:53.680 align:start position:0%
apparent that P the patients Bill of
 
03:55:56.389 --> 03:55:56.399 align:start position:0%
Rights in RSA 151 only applies to care
 
03:55:58.149 --> 03:55:58.159 align:start position:0%
in certain Healthcare facilities in the
 
03:56:00.070 --> 03:56:00.080 align:start position:0%
state and not into patient rights in
 
03:56:02.710 --> 03:56:02.720 align:start position:0%
general so future legislation P should
 
03:56:04.990 --> 03:56:05.000 align:start position:0%
put place place patient protections
 
03:56:06.830 --> 03:56:06.840 align:start position:0%
including the access to sterilization
 
03:56:10.110 --> 03:56:10.120 align:start position:0%

03:56:15.710 --> 03:56:15.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:18.710 --> 03:56:18.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
03:56:23.670 --> 03:56:23.680 align:start position:0%
um my concern with this
 
03:56:26.229 --> 03:56:26.239 align:start position:0%
legislation is the way it was
 
03:56:31.990 --> 03:56:32.000 align:start position:0%
drafted um but my other concern is the
 
03:56:35.590 --> 03:56:35.600 align:start position:0%
stories that we heard of people
 
03:56:39.510 --> 03:56:39.520 align:start position:0%
who uh went through very very difficult
 
03:56:46.149 --> 03:56:46.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:48.429 --> 03:56:48.439 align:start position:0%
lack of the care that they believed they
 
03:56:51.990 --> 03:56:52.000 align:start position:0%
needed and that was proved later on to
 
03:56:53.550 --> 03:56:53.560 align:start position:0%
be helpful to
 
03:56:53.560 --> 03:56:55.750 align:start position:0%
be helpful to
them

03:56:55.750 --> 03:56:55.760 align:start position:0%
them
 
03:57:01.510 --> 03:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
um I have my my concern with the bill
 
03:57:04.030 --> 03:57:04.040 align:start position:0%
was all the particulars
 
03:57:06.990 --> 03:57:07.000 align:start position:0%
about how we were going to effectuate
 
03:57:10.830 --> 03:57:10.840 align:start position:0%
this if there was something very limited
 
03:57:14.550 --> 03:57:14.560 align:start position:0%
which stated that uh the procedure could
 
03:57:17.349 --> 03:57:17.359 align:start position:0%
not be denied solely on the
 
03:57:22.070 --> 03:57:22.080 align:start position:0%
basis that a medical professional about
 
03:57:24.149 --> 03:57:24.159 align:start position:0%
opinion about what you might want later
 
03:57:26.349 --> 03:57:26.359 align:start position:0%
on in your life was better for you than
 
03:57:30.189 --> 03:57:30.199 align:start position:0%
what you thought was good for you um I I
 
03:57:33.590 --> 03:57:33.600 align:start position:0%
would be much more favorably um inclined
 
03:57:35.070 --> 03:57:35.080 align:start position:0%
towards such
 
03:57:39.269 --> 03:57:39.279 align:start position:0%
legislation so um for that
 
03:57:42.510 --> 03:57:42.520 align:start position:0%
reason I come down on the side of voting
 
03:57:44.269 --> 03:57:44.279 align:start position:0%
uh recommend
 
03:57:48.110 --> 03:57:48.120 align:start position:0%
but um I do have real reservations about
 
03:57:51.469 --> 03:57:51.479 align:start position:0%
the mechanisms contained in this
 
03:57:54.149 --> 03:57:54.159 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you other discussion
 
03:57:57.189 --> 03:57:57.199 align:start position:0%
representative papichi Müller thank you
 
03:57:59.309 --> 03:57:59.319 align:start position:0%
I'm encouraged to hear the comments of
 
03:58:02.229 --> 03:58:02.239 align:start position:0%
my colleagues
 
03:58:05.550 --> 03:58:05.560 align:start position:0%
um in the previous few votes we've made
 
03:58:07.030 --> 03:58:07.040 align:start position:0%
it clear that we don't necessarily
 
03:58:08.830 --> 03:58:08.840 align:start position:0%
support the legislation as written but
 
03:58:10.510 --> 03:58:10.520 align:start position:0%
we support the intent with the
 
03:58:12.510 --> 03:58:12.520 align:start position:0%
understanding that future legislation
 
03:58:14.110 --> 03:58:14.120 align:start position:0%
may be written in such a way to address
 
03:58:15.830 --> 03:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
address concerns expressed by this
 
03:58:18.429 --> 03:58:18.439 align:start position:0%
committee so I would like to encourage
 
03:58:21.309 --> 03:58:21.319 align:start position:0%
you know everyone to uh consider
 
03:58:23.030 --> 03:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
supporting this important bill at the
 
03:58:25.750 --> 03:58:25.760 align:start position:0%
end of the day it comes down to our
 
03:58:29.189 --> 03:58:29.199 align:start position:0%
agency and our ability to control what
 
03:58:31.309 --> 03:58:31.319 align:start position:0%
happens to our body and I think that if
 
03:58:33.429 --> 03:58:33.439 align:start position:0%
we believe in Freedom and the freedom to
 
03:58:36.630 --> 03:58:36.640 align:start position:0%
control what you know is happening to us
 
03:58:38.950 --> 03:58:38.960 align:start position:0%
this is a prime example of a bill that
 
03:58:42.510 --> 03:58:42.520 align:start position:0%
you know deserves support and again I'm
 
03:58:44.990 --> 03:58:45.000 align:start position:0%
sure that every word in Bill matters and
 
03:58:48.269 --> 03:58:48.279 align:start position:0%
it can be maybe made clearer that you
 
03:58:50.550 --> 03:58:50.560 align:start position:0%
know the pre-procedure cannot be denied
 
03:58:52.389 --> 03:58:52.399 align:start position:0%
solely on the basis of that I thought
 
03:58:54.429 --> 03:58:54.439 align:start position:0%
the language was already doing that but
 
03:58:57.830 --> 03:58:57.840 align:start position:0%
I'm just one of 400 so um I would
 
03:59:00.670 --> 03:59:00.680 align:start position:0%
appreciate everybody's um support for
 
03:59:02.349 --> 03:59:02.359 align:start position:0%
this again knowing that future
 
03:59:03.950 --> 03:59:03.960 align:start position:0%
legislation will have to go through a
 
03:59:09.710 --> 03:59:09.720 align:start position:0%
full legislative process thank you other
 
03:59:12.710 --> 03:59:12.720 align:start position:0%

discussion about this this morning but
 
04:01:04.950 --> 04:01:04.960 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor um acknowledged when
 
04:01:07.389 --> 04:01:07.399 align:start position:0%
he came to present the bill that this
 
04:01:09.670 --> 04:01:09.680 align:start position:0%
didn't not really
 
04:01:12.790 --> 04:01:12.800 align:start position:0%
meet his intentions in putting this bill
 
04:01:15.750 --> 04:01:15.760 align:start position:0%
forward um
 
04:01:18.309 --> 04:01:18.319 align:start position:0%
um and um
 
04:01:21.189 --> 04:01:21.199 align:start position:0%
secondarily um
 
04:01:23.590 --> 04:01:23.600 align:start position:0%
the program within the Department of
 
04:01:27.950 --> 04:01:27.960 align:start position:0%
Human Services that um coordinates with
 
04:01:31.550 --> 04:01:31.560 align:start position:0%
private nonprofits resettlement um
 
04:01:34.550 --> 04:01:34.560 align:start position:0%
organizations um only works with a
 
04:01:37.750 --> 04:01:37.760 align:start position:0%
select very select group of immigrants
 
04:01:38.790 --> 04:01:38.800 align:start position:0%
which are
 
04:01:42.670 --> 04:01:42.680 align:start position:0%
refugees and um the money is provided
 
04:01:47.429 --> 04:01:47.439 align:start position:0%
for um their um Staffing and for the
 
04:01:48.870 --> 04:01:48.880 align:start position:0%
limited amount of money that they're
 
04:01:52.950 --> 04:01:52.960 align:start position:0%
able to um give out in terms of Grants
 
04:01:55.269 --> 04:01:55.279 align:start position:0%
it's all federal money and the bill
 
04:01:58.149 --> 04:01:58.159 align:start position:0%
itself talked only about State funds so
 
04:01:58.159 --> 04:02:01.030 align:start position:0%
itself talked only about State funds so
it

04:02:01.030 --> 04:02:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:04.389 --> 04:02:04.399 align:start position:0%
um I just think that the I just think
 
04:02:08.950 --> 04:02:08.960 align:start position:0%
that it's irrelevant and also that
 
04:02:12.469 --> 04:02:12.479 align:start position:0%
um it didn't really um meet the the
 
04:02:14.590 --> 04:02:14.600 align:start position:0%
sponsor's intention and terms of having
 
04:02:17.309 --> 04:02:17.319 align:start position:0%
a broader discussion about the effects
 
04:02:19.670 --> 04:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
of immigration on our country so I think
 
04:02:22.950 --> 04:02:22.960 align:start position:0%
that um any other bill that's put
 
04:02:24.830 --> 04:02:24.840 align:start position:0%
forward would be so different from this
 
04:02:28.070 --> 04:02:28.080 align:start position:0%
bill that it would not really be
 
04:02:31.389 --> 04:02:31.399 align:start position:0%
related thank you representative TZ I
 
04:02:33.070 --> 04:02:33.080 align:start position:0%
just want to reiterate having directed
 
04:02:35.790 --> 04:02:35.800 align:start position:0%
The Office in which this program resides
 
04:02:38.910 --> 04:02:38.920 align:start position:0%
um the as written it is completely
 
04:02:40.750 --> 04:02:40.760 align:start position:0%
untenable these federal funds are
 
04:02:42.670 --> 04:02:42.680 align:start position:0%
completely directed to one unique
 
04:02:45.469 --> 04:02:45.479 align:start position:0%
purpose and the refugee program all
 
04:02:47.110 --> 04:02:47.120 align:start position:0%
costs are completely federally funded
 
04:02:49.389 --> 04:02:49.399 align:start position:0%
and there would be no way for it to be
 
04:02:53.469 --> 04:02:53.479 align:start position:0%
changed to uh other people or um again
 
04:02:55.550 --> 04:02:55.560 align:start position:0%
as uh represent sh pointed out there are
 
04:02:58.349 --> 04:02:58.359 align:start position:0%
no State funds involved so untenable
 
04:03:01.790 --> 04:03:01.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:04.590 --> 04:03:04.600 align:start position:0%

seconds the motion representative kofalt
 
04:04:40.469 --> 04:04:40.479 align:start position:0%
do you wish to speak to your
 
04:04:44.510 --> 04:04:44.520 align:start position:0%
motion yes I I the intent of the bill
 
04:04:47.830 --> 04:04:47.840 align:start position:0%
is I believe to see that data is
 
04:04:51.030 --> 04:04:51.040 align:start position:0%
available um given the very serious
 
04:04:53.550 --> 04:04:53.560 align:start position:0%
concerns that have been raised about the
 
04:04:55.950 --> 04:04:55.960 align:start position:0%
safety of certain vaccines in particular
 
04:04:58.149 --> 04:04:58.159 align:start position:0%
the uh the covid
 
04:05:01.389 --> 04:05:01.399 align:start position:0%
vaccine that that data be made available
 
04:05:05.070 --> 04:05:05.080 align:start position:0%
such that uh it could be analyzed and
 
04:05:07.030 --> 04:05:07.040 align:start position:0%
better understood uh that we could
 
04:05:09.550 --> 04:05:09.560 align:start position:0%
better understand the the uh
 
04:05:12.349 --> 04:05:12.359 align:start position:0%
correlations between um certain
 
04:05:15.990 --> 04:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
vaccinations and certain causes of death
 
04:05:18.870 --> 04:05:18.880 align:start position:0%
having said that the bill as
 
04:05:22.990 --> 04:05:23.000 align:start position:0%
introduced um was I think uh
 
04:05:24.670 --> 04:05:24.680 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily detailed and and
 
04:05:26.670 --> 04:05:26.680 align:start position:0%
burdensome um it did not take a
 
04:05:29.550 --> 04:05:29.560 align:start position:0%
lightweight approach to providing this
 
04:05:29.560 --> 04:05:31.389 align:start position:0%
lightweight approach to providing this
information

04:05:31.389 --> 04:05:31.399 align:start position:0%
information
 
04:05:35.389 --> 04:05:35.399 align:start position:0%
um so I I sort of understand the the
 
04:05:37.950 --> 04:05:37.960 align:start position:0%
sentiment behind um going interim study
 
04:05:39.990 --> 04:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
as as opposed to moving the bill forward
 
04:05:42.269 --> 04:05:42.279 align:start position:0%
having said that I think um that if we
 
04:05:43.790 --> 04:05:43.800 align:start position:0%
indeed want to follow the science we
 
04:05:46.950 --> 04:05:46.960 align:start position:0%
ought to um we ought to have uh this
 
04:05:48.149 --> 04:05:48.159 align:start position:0%
kind of data
 
04:05:51.149 --> 04:05:51.159 align:start position:0%
available representative
 
04:05:53.429 --> 04:05:53.439 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you for that and I
 
04:05:55.590 --> 04:05:55.600 align:start position:0%
appreciate the caveat that it ought to
 
04:05:58.710 --> 04:05:58.720 align:start position:0%
be done in a very different way this one
 
04:06:01.550 --> 04:06:01.560 align:start position:0%
of the conversations we had this morning
 
04:06:01.560 --> 04:06:02.469 align:start position:0%
of the conversations we had this morning
was

04:06:02.469 --> 04:06:02.479 align:start position:0%
was
 
04:06:02.479 --> 04:06:04.189 align:start position:0%
was
about

04:06:04.189 --> 04:06:04.199 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:06:07.469 --> 04:06:07.479 align:start position:0%
um whether we recommend or not recommend
 
04:06:10.469 --> 04:06:10.479 align:start position:0%
when where where the line comes between
 
04:06:12.429 --> 04:06:12.439 align:start position:0%
recommendation and not recommendation
 
04:06:13.950 --> 04:06:13.960 align:start position:0%
when we don't agree with the approaching
 
04:06:17.349 --> 04:06:17.359 align:start position:0%
the bill uh this one for me crosses the
 
04:06:19.790 --> 04:06:19.800 align:start position:0%
line into not recommending so I'm going
 
04:06:21.590 --> 04:06:21.600 align:start position:0%
to oppose the
 
04:06:25.550 --> 04:06:25.560 align:start position:0%
recommendation uh the reasons are this
 
04:06:27.750 --> 04:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
uh the data that you're collect first of
 
04:06:29.269 --> 04:06:29.279 align:start position:0%
all it's it's collecting the data in the
 
04:06:33.389 --> 04:06:33.399 align:start position:0%
wrong Forum um because the amount uh the
 
04:06:36.189 --> 04:06:36.199 align:start position:0%
number of people who certify deaths who
 
04:06:37.550 --> 04:06:37.560 align:start position:0%
would have to be
 
04:06:41.269 --> 04:06:41.279 align:start position:0%
incorporated into having access to the
 
04:06:44.189 --> 04:06:44.199 align:start position:0%
vaccine registry is
 
04:06:48.309 --> 04:06:48.319 align:start position:0%
um burdensome and it's burdensome of a
 
04:06:53.469 --> 04:06:53.479 align:start position:0%
procedure that happens at a time when um
 
04:06:55.630 --> 04:06:55.640 align:start position:0%
collecting vaccine records is
 
04:06:58.790 --> 04:06:58.800 align:start position:0%
particularly inappropriate um in in my
 
04:07:01.229 --> 04:07:01.239 align:start position:0%
case my late husband died at home and
 
04:07:04.429 --> 04:07:04.439 align:start position:0%
the hospice nurse uh certified the death
 
04:07:08.070 --> 04:07:08.080 align:start position:0%
uh she would not have had any access to
 
04:07:11.389 --> 04:07:11.399 align:start position:0%
the vaccine data that's requested
 
04:07:14.349 --> 04:07:14.359 align:start position:0%
here if you collect the data however
 
04:07:18.950 --> 04:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
it's collected as this requires you have
 
04:07:21.309 --> 04:07:21.319 align:start position:0%
not two columns but three columns you
 
04:07:25.030 --> 04:07:25.040 align:start position:0%
have people whose data is in the
 
04:07:28.830 --> 04:07:28.840 align:start position:0%
registry and can be retrieved however
 
04:07:32.349 --> 04:07:32.359 align:start position:0%
burdensome that is then you have people
 
04:07:35.870 --> 04:07:35.880 align:start position:0%
for whose death certificate has no data
 
04:07:38.790 --> 04:07:38.800 align:start position:0%
but what you don't know is how many of
 
04:07:41.910 --> 04:07:41.920 align:start position:0%
those people for whom there is no data
 
04:07:45.429 --> 04:07:45.439 align:start position:0%
are people who were vaccinated but chose
 
04:07:47.910 --> 04:07:47.920 align:start position:0%
not to become part of the registry as is
 
04:07:51.590 --> 04:07:51.600 align:start position:0%
their right or how many of them are
 
04:07:53.389 --> 04:07:53.399 align:start position:0%
people who are not
 
04:07:57.590 --> 04:07:57.600 align:start position:0%
vaccinated as is also their right so I
 
04:07:59.910 --> 04:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
don't believe that when we look at this
 
04:08:03.269 --> 04:08:03.279 align:start position:0%
data we're comparing Apples to Apples we
 
04:08:06.630 --> 04:08:06.640 align:start position:0%
don't have any way of separating out in
 
04:08:08.349 --> 04:08:08.359 align:start position:0%
the no data colum whether that means
 
04:08:09.870 --> 04:08:09.880 align:start position:0%
that they weren't vaccinated or they
 
04:08:12.429 --> 04:08:12.439 align:start position:0%
simply didn't want to be reported and
 
04:08:14.550 --> 04:08:14.560 align:start position:0%
then there were the issues for
 
04:08:16.349 --> 04:08:16.359 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
04:08:19.550 --> 04:08:19.560 align:start position:0%
in terms of the amount of extra work
 
04:08:22.750 --> 04:08:22.760 align:start position:0%
that was going to be for them the other
 
04:08:25.269 --> 04:08:25.279 align:start position:0%
um thing that was mentioned this morning
 
04:08:29.790 --> 04:08:29.800 align:start position:0%
that I will just note was that um at a
 
04:08:32.469 --> 04:08:32.479 align:start position:0%
time when we are having medical
 
04:08:34.349 --> 04:08:34.359 align:start position:0%
professionals assume more and more and
 
04:08:36.870 --> 04:08:36.880 align:start position:0%
more clerical stuff and data collection
 
04:08:40.070 --> 04:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
stuff and Hoops to jump through this was
 
04:08:42.910 --> 04:08:42.920 align:start position:0%
one more hoop that perhaps came at a
 
04:08:46.429 --> 04:08:46.439 align:start position:0%
particular inappropriate time so and
 
04:08:48.510 --> 04:08:48.520 align:start position:0%
done in an inappropriate way so I'm
 
04:08:51.590 --> 04:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
coming down on the side of saying no to
 
04:08:56.469 --> 04:08:56.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:59.070 --> 04:08:59.080 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Nel I've been
 
04:09:01.149 --> 04:09:01.159 align:start position:0%
going back and forth on the thank you Mr
 
04:09:02.750 --> 04:09:02.760 align:start position:0%
chairman I've been going back and forth
 
04:09:06.910 --> 04:09:06.920 align:start position:0%
on this bill for a lot of reasons I the
 
04:09:09.030 --> 04:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
question that I was focusing a lot on
 
04:09:12.830 --> 04:09:12.840 align:start position:0%
this morning is what is our role here
 
04:09:15.229 --> 04:09:15.239 align:start position:0%
and and and you kind of addressed that
 
04:09:18.710 --> 04:09:18.720 align:start position:0%
again but this is one bill that I really
 
04:09:20.830 --> 04:09:20.840 align:start position:0%
think that should have had a study group
 
04:09:22.309 --> 04:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
and it should have really looked at this
 
04:09:25.189 --> 04:09:25.199 align:start position:0%
in detail and should have gotten um
 
04:09:26.750 --> 04:09:26.760 align:start position:0%
testimony from the people that were
 
04:09:28.389 --> 04:09:28.399 align:start position:0%
going to be involved in collecting this
 
04:09:30.349 --> 04:09:30.359 align:start position:0%
data to find out how burdensome it was
 
04:09:32.229 --> 04:09:32.239 align:start position:0%
and it wasn't and that was not done and
 
04:09:33.590 --> 04:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
it was actually when I looked at my
 
04:09:35.149 --> 04:09:35.159 align:start position:0%
notes that was something that I had
 
04:09:36.830 --> 04:09:36.840 align:start position:0%
recommended when we actually heard this
 
04:09:39.109 --> 04:09:39.119 align:start position:0%
bill originally because that
 
04:09:41.309 --> 04:09:41.319 align:start position:0%
information's not there I have to say
 
04:09:43.510 --> 04:09:43.520 align:start position:0%
that to me it crosses the line too I
 
04:09:46.910 --> 04:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
think the concept's good um I just think
 
04:09:49.590 --> 04:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
the way we collect the data and how we
 
04:09:52.550 --> 04:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
affect the the practice of healthc Care
 
04:09:55.469 --> 04:09:55.479 align:start position:0%
at a critical time has to be considered
 
04:09:57.750 --> 04:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
and and certainly what we're doing here
 
04:10:00.950 --> 04:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
is not changing that F future
 
04:10:03.149 --> 04:10:03.159 align:start position:0%
legislation can't come but what it is
 
04:10:05.429 --> 04:10:05.439 align:start position:0%
saying is it can't come in this format
 
04:10:07.870 --> 04:10:07.880 align:start position:0%
and that's why I'm going to vote
 
04:10:11.590 --> 04:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:14.389 --> 04:10:14.399 align:start position:0%
discussion representative t yes hi yes
 
04:10:18.870 --> 04:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
thank you um I I would to me uh given my
 
04:10:21.870 --> 04:10:21.880 align:start position:0%
training the desire for wanting to know
 
04:10:23.189 --> 04:10:23.199 align:start position:0%
if there's an association between
 
04:10:25.229 --> 04:10:25.239 align:start position:0%
certain diagnoses at time of death or
 
04:10:27.710 --> 04:10:27.720 align:start position:0%
causes of death and any historical
 
04:10:29.790 --> 04:10:29.800 align:start position:0%
vaccines that may have been administered
 
04:10:34.990 --> 04:10:35.000 align:start position:0%
is completely a um you know a historical
 
04:10:36.950 --> 04:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
uh or retrospective you look at data
 
04:10:38.670 --> 04:10:38.680 align:start position:0%
sets it's a it's a it's something you
 
04:10:40.750 --> 04:10:40.760 align:start position:0%
just do with a computer if you have
 
04:10:42.950 --> 04:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
access to the data and you don't need to
 
04:10:45.349 --> 04:10:45.359 align:start position:0%
have the person who's certifying the
 
04:10:48.590 --> 04:10:48.600 align:start position:0%
death know anything about it so How It
 
04:10:51.469 --> 04:10:51.479 align:start position:0%
Was Written is what makes it untenable
 
04:10:53.389 --> 04:10:53.399 align:start position:0%
the idea that the person certifying the
 
04:10:55.349 --> 04:10:55.359 align:start position:0%
death would be the one who would review
 
04:10:57.189 --> 04:10:57.199 align:start position:0%
the the records for immunization is
 
04:10:59.269 --> 04:10:59.279 align:start position:0%
completely unnecessary and it's what
 
04:11:01.510 --> 04:11:01.520 align:start position:0%
makes it impossible um and the cost
 
04:11:03.349 --> 04:11:03.359 align:start position:0%
would be much more than what was written
 
04:11:05.710 --> 04:11:05.720 align:start position:0%
in the fiscal note um given the burden
 
04:11:08.550 --> 04:11:08.560 align:start position:0%
that it would it would impose so again
 
04:11:13.870 --> 04:11:13.880 align:start position:0%
untenable thank you other discussion
 
04:11:16.349 --> 04:11:16.359 align:start position:0%
seeing none um I'll call for the vote
 
04:11:19.149 --> 04:11:19.159 align:start position:0%
ask cl to call a roll motion is to

Weber I'll move not recommended for

future legislation for all the reasons
 
04:12:39.030 --> 04:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
that we've also already stated and also
 
04:12:43.670 --> 04:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
I'm going to um raise the issue of the
 
04:12:45.389 --> 04:12:45.399 align:start position:0%
fact that Based
 
04:12:49.269 --> 04:12:49.279 align:start position:0%
on data from Massachusetts we were given
 
04:12:52.189 --> 04:12:52.199 align:start position:0%
actual names associated with some of the
 
04:12:54.070 --> 04:12:54.080 align:start position:0%
data when when we heard this the first
 
04:12:56.070 --> 04:12:56.080 align:start position:0%
time around and I think the privacy
 
04:13:00.269 --> 04:13:00.279 align:start position:0%
issues in this format are are simply A
 
04:13:04.550 --> 04:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
Bridge Too Far um although if I'm
 
04:13:08.550 --> 04:13:08.560 align:start position:0%
drafting a response is it fair for me to
 
04:13:11.429 --> 04:13:11.439 align:start position:0%
put in that response uh that everybody
 
04:13:13.469 --> 04:13:13.479 align:start position:0%
on the committee is concerned about
 
04:13:13.479 --> 04:13:15.149 align:start position:0%
on the committee is concerned about
about

04:13:15.149 --> 04:13:15.159 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:13:18.309 --> 04:13:18.319 align:start position:0%
um assembling appropriate data about
 
04:13:21.070 --> 04:13:21.080 align:start position:0%
vaccination and and consequences of
 
04:13:24.429 --> 04:13:24.439 align:start position:0%
vaccination it's just that for those of
 
04:13:26.710 --> 04:13:26.720 align:start position:0%
us in the majority we don't believe it's
 
04:13:30.189 --> 04:13:30.199 align:start position:0%
this format any objections to
 
04:13:30.199 --> 04:13:32.990 align:start position:0%

04:13:32.990 --> 04:13:33.000 align:start position:0%

care representative Weber
 
04:19:46.429 --> 04:19:46.439 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry representative kofalt she for
 
04:19:50.070 --> 04:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
me okay sorry and and I just wanted to
 
04:19:53.229 --> 04:19:53.239 align:start position:0%
um say thank you to representative Leon
 
04:19:55.550 --> 04:19:55.560 align:start position:0%
we we discussed this significantly
 
04:19:59.990 --> 04:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
earlier in the work session and uh she's
 
04:20:03.229 --> 04:20:03.239 align:start position:0%
very succinctly
 
04:20:06.389 --> 04:20:06.399 align:start position:0%
expressed uh the concerns that we had
 
04:20:08.389 --> 04:20:08.399 align:start position:0%
not to stand in the way of appropriate
 
04:20:10.550 --> 04:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
medical treatment and to encourage
 
04:20:13.070 --> 04:20:13.080 align:start position:0%
medical treatment but the con concerns
 
04:20:15.429 --> 04:20:15.439 align:start position:0%
we had with the bill is presented was it
 
04:20:18.149 --> 04:20:18.159 align:start position:0%
was far too broad created a whole new
 
04:20:20.389 --> 04:20:20.399 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy and it was
 
04:20:23.630 --> 04:20:23.640 align:start position:0%
unclear how the supervision was going to
 
04:20:25.670 --> 04:20:25.680 align:start position:0%
happen and that it was going to happen
 
04:20:27.590 --> 04:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
in an appropriate setting so we want to
 
04:20:29.670 --> 04:20:29.680 align:start position:0%
get out of the way of progress but we
 
04:20:31.149 --> 04:20:31.159 align:start position:0%
don't want to set up a whole new
 
04:20:33.550 --> 04:20:33.560 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy and I think that the
 
04:20:35.149 --> 04:20:35.159 align:start position:0%
statement does
 
04:20:35.159 --> 04:20:37.109 align:start position:0%
statement does
that

04:20:37.109 --> 04:20:37.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:20:39.229 --> 04:20:39.239 align:start position:0%
representative yeah I I think that
 
04:20:42.109 --> 04:20:42.119 align:start position:0%
representative Weber touched on what I
 
04:20:44.670 --> 04:20:44.680 align:start position:0%
wanted to to uh say which was that the
 
04:20:46.710 --> 04:20:46.720 align:start position:0%
original bill was modeled after cannabis
 
04:20:49.149 --> 04:20:49.159 align:start position:0%
legislation and this is a completely
 
04:20:53.149 --> 04:20:53.159 align:start position:0%
different um category of treatment um
 
04:20:55.229 --> 04:20:55.239 align:start position:0%
that what we are talking about is a
 
04:20:59.469 --> 04:20:59.479 align:start position:0%
situation in which the use of these
 
04:21:03.910 --> 04:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
substances is highly highly supervised
 
04:21:05.870 --> 04:21:05.880 align:start position:0%
and um I think is showing great
 
04:21:07.630 --> 04:21:07.640 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness in the treatment of PTSD
 
04:21:11.950 --> 04:21:11.960 align:start position:0%
and other um other maladies and so um I
 
04:21:13.790 --> 04:21:13.800 align:start position:0%
just want people to be very very clear
 
04:21:17.349 --> 04:21:17.359 align:start position:0%
that this is um to to reiterate a point
 
04:21:18.910 --> 04:21:18.920 align:start position:0%
we brought up earlier that this is is
 
04:21:21.550 --> 04:21:21.560 align:start position:0%
entirely different from the the kind of
 
04:21:24.229 --> 04:21:24.239 align:start position:0%
legislation that has uh made medical
 
04:21:26.510 --> 04:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
cannabis um
 
04:21:29.269 --> 04:21:29.279 align:start position:0%
legal representative n thank you Mr
 
04:21:30.990 --> 04:21:31.000 align:start position:0%
chairman I'm going to just demonstrate
 
04:21:32.990 --> 04:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
my hypocrisy and say that I really
 
04:21:34.870 --> 04:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
cannot stand the format of the way this
 
04:21:36.950 --> 04:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
bill was intended like the other Bill
 
04:21:39.309 --> 04:21:39.319 align:start position:0%
however I really greatly appreciate the
 
04:21:41.149 --> 04:21:41.159 align:start position:0%
way you wrote this up and I will support
 
04:21:41.159 --> 04:21:43.469 align:start position:0%
way you wrote this up and I will support
that

04:21:43.469 --> 04:21:43.479 align:start position:0%

seconds representative Nagel do you wish
 
04:23:25.189 --> 04:23:25.199 align:start position:0%
to speak to your motion um I think we
 
04:23:27.149 --> 04:23:27.159 align:start position:0%
talked a lot about it this morning I
 
04:23:29.510 --> 04:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
don't have a whole lot more to say I
 
04:23:32.309 --> 04:23:32.319 align:start position:0%
just I I do like the concept that this
 
04:23:34.349 --> 04:23:34.359 align:start position:0%
bill raised about looking at the whole
 
04:23:36.550 --> 04:23:36.560 align:start position:0%
concept of informed consent which I
 
04:23:39.229 --> 04:23:39.239 align:start position:0%
think really needs to be done however
 
04:23:42.070 --> 04:23:42.080 align:start position:0%
the concept of requiring or putting in
 
04:23:44.189 --> 04:23:44.199 align:start position:0%
stat statute and informed consent for a
 
04:23:46.349 --> 04:23:46.359 align:start position:0%
single procedure on the basis of a
 
04:23:48.469 --> 04:23:48.479 align:start position:0%
relatively small percentage of Americans
 
04:23:50.910 --> 04:23:50.920 align:start position:0%
who who feel that way and we never did
 
04:23:53.269 --> 04:23:53.279 align:start position:0%
hear from the others as we noted this
 
04:23:55.590 --> 04:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
morning bothers me a lot and therefore I
 
04:23:57.630 --> 04:23:57.640 align:start position:0%
I really can't support this it really
 
04:23:59.349 --> 04:23:59.359 align:start position:0%
interferes with medical practice and I
 
04:24:04.189 --> 04:24:04.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:06.510 --> 04:24:06.520 align:start position:0%

04:24:13.510 --> 04:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
consent for everything and not for the
 
04:24:16.309 --> 04:24:16.319 align:start position:0%
specific on this yeah okay and then I
 
04:24:18.229 --> 04:24:18.239 align:start position:0%
can support that so thank you to me
 
04:24:20.830 --> 04:24:20.840 align:start position:0%
that's a really important issue that I
 
04:24:22.670 --> 04:24:22.680 align:start position:0%
really was glad that this bill raised
 
04:24:24.550 --> 04:24:24.560 align:start position:0%
that and the other bill that
 
04:24:26.309 --> 04:24:26.319 align:start position:0%

04:26:36.550 --> 04:26:36.560 align:start position:0%
uh the testimony and the discussion at
 
04:26:38.670 --> 04:26:38.680 align:start position:0%
the time the bill was heard everybody
 
04:26:41.189 --> 04:26:41.199 align:start position:0%
agreed that you know the patients own
 
04:26:44.349 --> 04:26:44.359 align:start position:0%
their records um and I don't think it's
 
04:26:48.389 --> 04:26:48.399 align:start position:0%
fair that if you know someone engages an
 
04:26:50.950 --> 04:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
agent because they're incapacitated that
 
04:26:54.149 --> 04:26:54.159 align:start position:0%
they should be charged $4,000 as opposed
 
04:26:54.159 --> 04:26:55.870 align:start position:0%
they should be charged $4,000 as opposed
to

04:26:55.870 --> 04:26:55.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:26:59.790 --> 04:26:59.800 align:start position:0%
$6.50 however being practical um if you
 
04:27:02.790 --> 04:27:02.800 align:start position:0%
went $6.50 across the board the third
 
04:27:04.469 --> 04:27:04.479 align:start position:0%
party agencies that do the work would
 
04:27:07.189 --> 04:27:07.199 align:start position:0%
basically go out of business so we we
 
04:27:09.790 --> 04:27:09.800 align:start position:0%
did try to Amendment an amendment to try
 
04:27:11.670 --> 04:27:11.680 align:start position:0%
to thread the needle I don't think the
 
04:27:14.189 --> 04:27:14.199 align:start position:0%
amendment was able to settle in on the
 
04:27:16.349 --> 04:27:16.359 align:start position:0%
the final solution but I think the
 
04:27:19.309 --> 04:27:19.319 align:start position:0%
concept is good and if we can find a way
 
04:27:22.109 --> 04:27:22.119 align:start position:0%
you know to do that I I don't think we
 
04:27:25.109 --> 04:27:25.119 align:start position:0%
want to be punishing people that want
 
04:27:26.590 --> 04:27:26.600 align:start position:0%
access to their information but would
 
04:27:28.950 --> 04:27:28.960 align:start position:0%
want to engage another party to to
 
04:27:31.469 --> 04:27:31.479 align:start position:0%
assist them in doing that so um I would
 
04:27:33.429 --> 04:27:33.439 align:start position:0%
recommend for future legislation thank
 
04:27:38.149 --> 04:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:40.349 --> 04:27:40.359 align:start position:0%

there a second representative lay on
 
04:29:30.469 --> 04:29:30.479 align:start position:0%
seconds you wish to speak to your
 
04:29:33.950 --> 04:29:33.960 align:start position:0%
motion little bit I'm the expert on this
 
04:29:36.670 --> 04:29:36.680 align:start position:0%
thinking our our group is um not here
 
04:29:41.429 --> 04:29:41.439 align:start position:0%
today um I was drawn by his um uh
 
04:29:43.429 --> 04:29:43.439 align:start position:0%
committee report court on this bill
 
04:29:46.309 --> 04:29:46.319 align:start position:0%
originally um where he felt that unless
 
04:29:49.229 --> 04:29:49.239 align:start position:0%
certain things happened that he did not
 
04:29:51.349 --> 04:29:51.359 align:start position:0%
recommend further legislation as M I
 
04:29:53.349 --> 04:29:53.359 align:start position:0%
don't know if they have or they have not
 
04:29:55.870 --> 04:29:55.880 align:start position:0%
but um based on that alone I think that
 
04:29:58.630 --> 04:29:58.640 align:start position:0%
I would rely on his judgment and say
 
04:30:01.469 --> 04:30:01.479 align:start position:0%
no representative Lon uh thank you Mr
 
04:30:02.830 --> 04:30:02.840 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you representative
 
04:30:05.349 --> 04:30:05.359 align:start position:0%
Nagel um with that reviewing the
 
04:30:07.269 --> 04:30:07.279 align:start position:0%
previous information I would say that
 
04:30:08.830 --> 04:30:08.840 align:start position:0%
the current status is that it's not
 
04:30:10.630 --> 04:30:10.640 align:start position:0%
recommended for future legislation but
 
04:30:12.309 --> 04:30:12.319 align:start position:0%
if we find that there's additional Road
 
04:30:14.229 --> 04:30:14.239 align:start position:0%
Blocks with the Board of Pharmacy then
 
04:30:16.149 --> 04:30:16.159 align:start position:0%
the situation would have changed so as
 
04:30:17.710 --> 04:30:17.720 align:start position:0%
long as the Board of Pharmacy is moving
 
04:30:19.229 --> 04:30:19.239 align:start position:0%
ahead in order to find a way to
 
04:30:20.910 --> 04:30:20.920 align:start position:0%
accommodate these needs there's no need
 
04:30:20.920 --> 04:30:23.590 align:start position:0%
accommodate these needs there's no need
for

04:30:23.590 --> 04:30:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:27.149 --> 04:30:27.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:29.710 --> 04:30:29.720 align:start position:0%
discussion I'm seeing no other
 
04:30:32.750 --> 04:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
discussion the motion is against
 
04:30:35.229 --> 04:30:35.239 align:start position:0%

04:32:03.670 --> 04:32:03.680 align:start position:0%
motion representative McLean yes thank
 
04:32:06.109 --> 04:32:06.119 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um let me just look at my
 
04:32:08.269 --> 04:32:08.279 align:start position:0%
not we did have a subcommittee and uh we
 
04:32:12.349 --> 04:32:12.359 align:start position:0%
did meet um had a conversation with the
 
04:32:14.990 --> 04:32:15.000 align:start position:0%
new mayor Manchester and some of the
 
04:32:17.149 --> 04:32:17.159 align:start position:0%
most important legislation that we can
 
04:32:20.389 --> 04:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
address up here in in conquer is that
 
04:32:22.389 --> 04:32:22.399 align:start position:0%
you know relating to substance abuse
 
04:32:25.750 --> 04:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
treatment Manchester is Ground Zero in
 
04:32:30.070 --> 04:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
in many respects and so um even though
 
04:32:32.550 --> 04:32:32.560 align:start position:0%
I'm a limited government person um and
 
04:32:34.670 --> 04:32:34.680 align:start position:0%
really believe in in the market in a lot
 
04:32:37.550 --> 04:32:37.560 align:start position:0%
of areas you know when people are coming
 
04:32:40.389 --> 04:32:40.399 align:start position:0%
out and they're looking for treatment to
 
04:32:42.429 --> 04:32:42.439 align:start position:0%
deal with substance abuse it's not like
 
04:32:44.550 --> 04:32:44.560 align:start position:0%
going out and looking for someone you
 
04:32:46.630 --> 04:32:46.640 align:start position:0%
know on Angie's List to to to fix the
 
04:32:49.229 --> 04:32:49.239 align:start position:0%
roof on your house and in in
 
04:32:50.990 --> 04:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
conversation with the mayor who himself
 
04:32:53.109 --> 04:32:53.119 align:start position:0%
is a recovered addict you know he said
 
04:32:54.630 --> 04:32:54.640 align:start position:0%
if someone comes out of Valley Street
 
04:32:57.269 --> 04:32:57.279 align:start position:0%
jail clean we have a rare chance to keep
 
04:32:59.389 --> 04:32:59.399 align:start position:0%
them that way and if we send them to a
 
04:33:02.189 --> 04:33:02.199 align:start position:0%
place um that's you know the wild west
 
04:33:03.750 --> 04:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
and and the counselor is not fully
 
04:33:06.230 --> 04:33:06.240 align:start position:0%
through their own recovery Journey then
 
04:33:09.230 --> 04:33:09.240 align:start position:0%
that opportunity is really lost um and
 
04:33:10.230 --> 04:33:10.240 align:start position:0%
so the
 
04:33:13.310 --> 04:33:13.320 align:start position:0%
subcommittee Met and we went through a
 
04:33:15.470 --> 04:33:15.480 align:start position:0%
lot of the concerns that were brought
 
04:33:18.349 --> 04:33:18.359 align:start position:0%
forth by the full committee and we don't
 
04:33:20.750 --> 04:33:20.760 align:start position:0%
have uh the final language but we did go
 
04:33:22.910 --> 04:33:22.920 align:start position:0%
through and and develop a lot of what we
 
04:33:24.590 --> 04:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
think that final language should look
 
04:33:26.629 --> 04:33:26.639 align:start position:0%
like and we're not really voting on that
 
04:33:29.390 --> 04:33:29.400 align:start position:0%
as much as the concept um but the
 
04:33:31.629 --> 04:33:31.639 align:start position:0%
language that we did agree on uh gets
 
04:33:33.869 --> 04:33:33.879 align:start position:0%
rid of the residential stuff this is
 
04:33:36.789 --> 04:33:36.799 align:start position:0%
focusing on the outpatient and it really
 
04:33:38.750 --> 04:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
is limiting the scope and getting rid of
 
04:33:40.590 --> 04:33:40.600 align:start position:0%
some of the concerns that people like
 
04:33:42.349 --> 04:33:42.359 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant had is just
 
04:33:45.189 --> 04:33:45.199 align:start position:0%
going to infringe on AA and things like
 
04:33:48.310 --> 04:33:48.320 align:start position:0%
that so um a lot of members of the Phil
 
04:33:50.349 --> 04:33:50.359 align:start position:0%
full committee were saying why not just
 
04:33:53.990 --> 04:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
let oplc do this since the individual
 
04:33:56.189 --> 04:33:56.199 align:start position:0%
practitioners they're already licensed
 
04:34:00.070 --> 04:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
by oplc and and the response back over
 
04:34:02.189 --> 04:34:02.199 align:start position:0%
and over again in in the subcommittee
 
04:34:05.629 --> 04:34:05.639 align:start position:0%
hearings is that really we want to be
 
04:34:08.470 --> 04:34:08.480 align:start position:0%
understanding what is best practice in
 
04:34:10.551 --> 04:34:10.561 align:start position:0%
the facilities themselves and that kind
 
04:34:12.269 --> 04:34:12.279 align:start position:0%
of led to the next question
 
04:34:15.429 --> 04:34:15.439 align:start position:0%
is that going to choke off and maybe uh
 
04:34:18.910 --> 04:34:18.920 align:start position:0%
strangle Innovation but actually when we
 
04:34:21.789 --> 04:34:21.799 align:start position:0%
spoke to people such as Granite recovery
 
04:34:24.150 --> 04:34:24.160 align:start position:0%
that take Medicaid and they're already
 
04:34:26.390 --> 04:34:26.400 align:start position:0%
regulated they're saying this is a very
 
04:34:28.830 --> 04:34:28.840 align:start position:0%
Innovative field that is moving away
 
04:34:31.029 --> 04:34:31.039 align:start position:0%
from cookie cutter approaches to to more
 
04:34:33.910 --> 04:34:33.920 align:start position:0%
targeted approaches and that nothing
 
04:34:36.070 --> 04:34:36.080 align:start position:0%
within the Medicaid rule framework has
 
04:34:38.709 --> 04:34:38.719 align:start position:0%
stopped them from making you know those
 
04:34:41.470 --> 04:34:41.480 align:start position:0%
Innovations and so they don't anticipate
 
04:34:43.230 --> 04:34:43.240 align:start position:0%
that any rules that we would be bringing
 
04:34:46.789 --> 04:34:46.799 align:start position:0%
forth with with DHHS would do the same
 
04:34:49.510 --> 04:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
the the the consensus seemed to be from
 
04:34:51.590 --> 04:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
the people who were testifying is that a
 
04:34:53.910 --> 04:34:53.920 align:start position:0%
larger barrier to Innovation might be
 
04:34:55.949 --> 04:34:55.959 align:start position:0%
from the insurance companies which are a
 
04:34:58.310 --> 04:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
little bit more conservative and are
 
04:35:00.429 --> 04:35:00.439 align:start position:0%
thinking you know maybe we want to just
 
04:35:02.670 --> 04:35:02.680 align:start position:0%
be ensuring stuff that's already out
 
04:35:04.470 --> 04:35:04.480 align:start position:0%
there and is already well established
 
04:35:06.910 --> 04:35:06.920 align:start position:0%
but from a perspective of with these
 
04:35:09.830 --> 04:35:09.840 align:start position:0%
rules themselves impede Innovation I I
 
04:35:11.789 --> 04:35:11.799 align:start position:0%
think the consensus with that not the
 
04:35:14.029 --> 04:35:14.039 align:start position:0%
case the other thing we kind of asked
 
04:35:16.310 --> 04:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
was you know why not just rely heavily
 
04:35:18.670 --> 04:35:18.680 align:start position:0%
on the utsman if we have abuses or
 
04:35:22.230 --> 04:35:22.240 align:start position:0%
things like that um part of the bill
 
04:35:24.470 --> 04:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
brought forth the utsman provision and
 
04:35:25.830 --> 04:35:25.840 align:start position:0%
we we talked about some different
 
04:35:28.629 --> 04:35:28.639 align:start position:0%
examples such as uh the right to know
 
04:35:31.510 --> 04:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
edsman but the reason that the right to
 
04:35:34.869 --> 04:35:34.879 align:start position:0%
know edsman works is because there's
 
04:35:37.070 --> 04:35:37.080 align:start position:0%
already a set of rules that's there
 
04:35:40.990 --> 04:35:41.000 align:start position:0%
which is um RSA 91a and so if you were
 
04:35:43.390 --> 04:35:43.400 align:start position:0%
to go to the RSA to
 
04:35:46.349 --> 04:35:46.359 align:start position:0%
the the the right to know Ombudsman and
 
04:35:48.470 --> 04:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
say we're looking for a ruling on that
 
04:35:51.310 --> 04:35:51.320 align:start position:0%
if you don't have the rules then what do
 
04:35:55.390 --> 04:35:55.400 align:start position:0%
they refer to so again the rules kind of
 
04:35:57.590 --> 04:35:57.600 align:start position:0%
have to come first so I think that you
 
04:35:59.830 --> 04:35:59.840 align:start position:0%
know on balance we don't have the final
 
04:36:02.670 --> 04:36:02.680 align:start position:0%
language but I think this is something
 
04:36:04.510 --> 04:36:04.520 align:start position:0%
that that's really important to people
 
04:36:06.510 --> 04:36:06.520 align:start position:0%
going into recovery I think it's
 
04:36:08.390 --> 04:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
something that's really important to
 
04:36:09.949 --> 04:36:09.959 align:start position:0%
those of us who are in Manchester who
 
04:36:12.470 --> 04:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
are at the center of this thing and so
 
04:36:13.830 --> 04:36:13.840 align:start position:0%
what I would love to do is have the
 
04:36:15.510 --> 04:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
committee come forth with a
 
04:36:17.949 --> 04:36:17.959 align:start position:0%
recommendation for future legislation so
 
04:36:19.949 --> 04:36:19.959 align:start position:0%
that we can bring it back next year uh
 
04:36:22.629 --> 04:36:22.639 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you
 
04:36:24.109 --> 04:36:24.119 align:start position:0%
representative uh King and then
 
04:36:24.119 --> 04:36:25.269 align:start position:0%
representative uh King and then
representative

04:36:25.269 --> 04:36:25.279 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:36:27.869 --> 04:36:27.879 align:start position:0%
Pall thank you Mr chair I just want to
 
04:36:29.789 --> 04:36:29.799 align:start position:0%
thank uh representative mlan for the
 
04:36:32.869 --> 04:36:32.879 align:start position:0%
work you did on this and um and being in
 
04:36:35.670 --> 04:36:35.680 align:start position:0%
touch with uh mayor of Manchester um I
 
04:36:38.470 --> 04:36:38.480 align:start position:0%
initially was going to oppose uh
 
04:36:40.590 --> 04:36:40.600 align:start position:0%
recommending the bill but based on
 
04:36:42.590 --> 04:36:42.600 align:start position:0%
everything you just said now including
 
04:36:44.150 --> 04:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
the fact that you shared my concerns
 
04:36:45.990 --> 04:36:46.000 align:start position:0%
with the original language of the bill
 
04:36:47.709 --> 04:36:47.719 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm going to follow your lead and
 
04:36:50.750 --> 04:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
support this um thank you thank you
 
04:36:50.760 --> 04:36:52.349 align:start position:0%
support this um thank you thank you
representative

04:36:52.349 --> 04:36:52.359 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:36:54.390 --> 04:36:54.400 align:start position:0%
kofalt I'm I'm going to vote against
 
04:36:59.390 --> 04:36:59.400 align:start position:0%
this I I am Gravely concerned that um
 
04:37:02.310 --> 04:37:02.320 align:start position:0%
this stands in the way of innovation I
 
04:37:03.390 --> 04:37:03.400 align:start position:0%
understand that you've you've made some
 
04:37:06.990 --> 04:37:07.000 align:start position:0%
arguments that it it does not um I think
 
04:37:08.590 --> 04:37:08.600 align:start position:0%
it stands in the way of innovation I
 
04:37:11.029 --> 04:37:11.039 align:start position:0%
have serious concerns about the impact
 
04:37:11.039 --> 04:37:12.830 align:start position:0%
have serious concerns about the impact
on

04:37:12.830 --> 04:37:12.840 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:37:16.709 --> 04:37:16.719 align:start position:0%
um AA and similar programs that you know
 
04:37:19.029 --> 04:37:19.039 align:start position:0%
despite reassurances that this is not
 
04:37:21.990 --> 04:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
aimed at them um I think once we start
 
04:37:24.830 --> 04:37:24.840 align:start position:0%
down this path that is where it goes so
 
04:37:27.070 --> 04:37:27.080 align:start position:0%
I will be voting
 
04:37:29.429 --> 04:37:29.439 align:start position:0%
against other discussion representative
 
04:37:31.709 --> 04:37:31.719 align:start position:0%
Lon um thank you Mr chairman I think
 
04:37:33.349 --> 04:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
that there's been some interesting
 
04:37:34.629 --> 04:37:34.639 align:start position:0%
viewpoints that have come up I
 
04:37:37.470 --> 04:37:37.480 align:start position:0%
appreciate the work that you've done um
 
04:37:39.349 --> 04:37:39.359 align:start position:0%
I I haven't been able to read the work
 
04:37:41.629 --> 04:37:41.639 align:start position:0%
that you put together and um just trying
 
04:37:43.029 --> 04:37:43.039 align:start position:0%
to look at this trying to look at our
 
04:37:45.470 --> 04:37:45.480 align:start position:0%
impact Within These it looks to me by
 
04:37:47.029 --> 04:37:47.039 align:start position:0%
counting votes that there'll be the
 
04:37:48.990 --> 04:37:49.000 align:start position:0%
votes to pass it as recommended for
 
04:37:51.269 --> 04:37:51.279 align:start position:0%
future legislation but then also
 
04:37:53.551 --> 04:37:53.561 align:start position:0%
recognizing the other concerns I feel
 
04:37:55.470 --> 04:37:55.480 align:start position:0%
compelled personally to vote against the
 
04:37:57.869 --> 04:37:57.879 align:start position:0%
recommendation for future legislation
 
04:37:59.670 --> 04:37:59.680 align:start position:0%
not because I don't want to see what you
 
04:38:01.830 --> 04:38:01.840 align:start position:0%
bring forward and I do hope to see it
 
04:38:03.590 --> 04:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
filed but so that there's not an
 
04:38:05.349 --> 04:38:05.359 align:start position:0%
overwhelming number of us all supporting
 
04:38:07.590 --> 04:38:07.600 align:start position:0%
it giving it toward the Mandate because
 
04:38:10.150 --> 04:38:10.160 align:start position:0%
I am concerned about impacting the whole
 
04:38:14.429 --> 04:38:14.439 align:start position:0%
ecosystem of recovery because um drug
 
04:38:18.551 --> 04:38:18.561 align:start position:0%
abuse and Recovery takes many paths and
 
04:38:20.390 --> 04:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't want to stop anybody
 
04:38:21.629 --> 04:38:21.639 align:start position:0%
from getting the treatment they need
 
04:38:22.869 --> 04:38:22.879 align:start position:0%
while I also want to make sure that
 
04:38:24.590 --> 04:38:24.600 align:start position:0%
vulnerable people aren't taken advantage
 
04:38:28.230 --> 04:38:28.240 align:start position:0%
of so you know got to pick one way or
 
04:38:29.390 --> 04:38:29.400 align:start position:0%
the other and I'm just going to try not
 
04:38:31.310 --> 04:38:31.320 align:start position:0%
to stack that but I'm releasing anybody
 
04:38:33.150 --> 04:38:33.160 align:start position:0%
who's following my vote from uh
 
04:38:34.869 --> 04:38:34.879 align:start position:0%
following my vote on this
 
04:38:37.109 --> 04:38:37.119 align:start position:0%
one representative
 
04:38:39.750 --> 04:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
wber thank you and I I just really want
 
04:38:41.709 --> 04:38:41.719 align:start position:0%
to Second everything that um
 
04:38:47.510 --> 04:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
representative mlan said um the I we
 
04:38:49.709 --> 04:38:49.719 align:start position:0%
learned a lot in the subcommittee and I
 
04:38:52.551 --> 04:38:52.561 align:start position:0%
was persuaded you know I'm very much of
 
04:38:55.429 --> 04:38:55.439 align:start position:0%
the opinion that uh this is not an area
 
04:38:57.029 --> 04:38:57.039 align:start position:0%
where one size is going to fit all and
 
04:38:58.590 --> 04:38:58.600 align:start position:0%
that we need to have a range of
 
04:38:59.949 --> 04:38:59.959 align:start position:0%
treatments because some are going to be
 
04:39:01.830 --> 04:39:01.840 align:start position:0%
more effective for one person than for
 
04:39:06.470 --> 04:39:06.480 align:start position:0%
another person uh but I was persuaded in
 
04:39:08.590 --> 04:39:08.600 align:start position:0%
the course of our discussion that we
 
04:39:12.230 --> 04:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
were not putting roadblocks in the way
 
04:39:15.949 --> 04:39:15.959 align:start position:0%
uh but that we need to protect people
 
04:39:18.029 --> 04:39:18.039 align:start position:0%
who are in a vulnerable part of their
 
04:39:20.949 --> 04:39:20.959 align:start position:0%
life so uh I come out in favor and I
 
04:39:24.150 --> 04:39:24.160 align:start position:0%
just wanted to also pass along that um
 
04:39:26.830 --> 04:39:26.840 align:start position:0%
uh I'm I'm sure your ears were burning
 
04:39:28.269 --> 04:39:28.279 align:start position:0%
this morning because there were a lot of
 
04:39:30.310 --> 04:39:30.320 align:start position:0%
very complimentary remarks about your
 
04:39:32.150 --> 04:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
chairmanship of the committee and your
 
04:39:33.910 --> 04:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
approach to the process and your
 
04:39:35.910 --> 04:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
willingness to take it on so we're all
 
04:39:39.628 --> 04:39:39.638 align:start position:0%
grateful for that however we come
 
04:39:43.628 --> 04:39:43.638 align:start position:0%

04:41:26.070 --> 04:41:26.080 align:start position:0%
to all the members of the committee for
 
04:41:28.868 --> 04:41:28.878 align:start position:0%
all of the struggles we have faced
 
04:41:31.788 --> 04:41:31.798 align:start position:0%
together over the last two years and I
 
04:41:33.708 --> 04:41:33.718 align:start position:0%
wanted to particularly thank you for the
 
04:41:35.830 --> 04:41:35.840 align:start position:0%
way you have run this committee I I
