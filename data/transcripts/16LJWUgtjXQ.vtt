consent calendar is at your disposal is
 
00:06:45.309 --> 00:06:45.319 align:start position:0%
there a motion I'll move the consent
 
00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
calendar motion by uh Senator gray
 
00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:51.000 align:start position:0%

00:06:52.749 --> 00:06:52.759 align:start position:0%
rest of the consent calendar is any
 
00:06:54.749 --> 00:06:54.759 align:start position:0%
further discussion seeing none all in
 
00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
favor say I I oppose no consent calendar
 
00:07:00.869 --> 00:07:00.879 align:start position:0%
is adopted uh Mr to shair just a comment
 
00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:02.869 align:start position:0%
is adopted uh Mr to shair just a comment
on

00:07:02.869 --> 00:07:02.879 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:06.360 align:start position:0%
2557 is that part of that is it that I
 
00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
want to talk about so although
 
00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
transportation is involved uh they may
 
00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:14.120 align:start position:0%
also want to be sitting at the table
 
00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:16.680 align:start position:0%
when we talk director gou is present I'm
 
00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:18.680 align:start position:0%
sure he's ready to answer any questions
 
00:07:20.189 --> 00:07:20.199 align:start position:0%
I just didn't want him to make it to the
 
00:07:20.199 --> 00:07:23.150 align:start position:0%
I just didn't want him to make it to the
door

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:26.189 --> 00:07:26.199 align:start position:0%
before Department of Transportation is
 
00:07:29.909 --> 00:07:29.919 align:start position:0%
is uh requested a presence here for
 
00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
answers to FIS
 
00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:54.909 --> 00:07:54.919 align:start position:0%
4 good morning Mr chair and members of
 
00:07:57.029 --> 00:07:57.039 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record my name's
 
00:07:59.189 --> 00:07:59.199 align:start position:0%
David rodrig assistant commissioner and
 
00:08:01.469 --> 00:08:01.479 align:start position:0%
chief engineer for the Department of
 
00:08:01.479 --> 00:08:04.430 align:start position:0%
chief engineer for the Department of
Transportation

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:04.440 align:start position:0%
Transportation
 
00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:08.720 align:start position:0%
welcome Senator gray my question is
 
00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:12.440 align:start position:0%
about the 2.5
 
00:08:14.589 --> 00:08:14.599 align:start position:0%
million because we're going out we're
 
00:08:16.909 --> 00:08:16.919 align:start position:0%
buying a system
 
00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:19.560 align:start position:0%
we're buying other things and that's
 
00:08:21.869 --> 00:08:21.879 align:start position:0%
like you know
 
00:08:24.469 --> 00:08:24.479 align:start position:0%
750 million or
 
00:08:27.869 --> 00:08:27.879 align:start position:0%
750,000 but then I've got this 2 million
 
00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:30.360 align:start position:0%
plus uh that look like I'm hiring
 
00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
Consultants to do it normally I would
 
00:08:36.949 --> 00:08:36.959 align:start position:0%
see that I'm going to save money uh by
 
00:08:38.709 --> 00:08:38.719 align:start position:0%
buying a computer system that's going to
 
00:08:38.719 --> 00:08:39.509 align:start position:0%
buying a computer system that's going to
do

00:08:39.509 --> 00:08:39.519 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:08:42.509 --> 00:08:42.519 align:start position:0%
XYZ but then when I see this High
 
00:08:45.949 --> 00:08:45.959 align:start position:0%
Personnel cost I don't understand it I
 
00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:49.240 align:start position:0%
want to understand it yes and uh I'm I'm
 
00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:50.680 align:start position:0%
going to give you both the opportunity
 
00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:53.480 align:start position:0%
to talk well well thank you so much for
 
00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:56.440 align:start position:0%
that question any the opportunity to
 
00:09:00.069 --> 00:09:00.079 align:start position:0%
explain it what what does Grant is all
 
00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:03.200 align:start position:0%
about and what this project is all about
 
00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:07.560 align:start position:0%
is not one computer system the the do
 
00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
from the time we plan a a project design
 
00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
a project advertise it for construction
 
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
construct the project and then take all
 
00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:21.680 align:start position:0%
the information from that project into
 
00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:25.800 align:start position:0%
our systems to maintain and operate the
 
00:09:28.509 --> 00:09:28.519 align:start position:0%
our infrastructure and assets through
 
00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
the long-term life we have many many
 
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
many different systems some are paper
 
00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
some are electronic and so forth so a
 
00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:41.160 align:start position:0%
few examples surveyors go out with
 
00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:44.440 align:start position:0%
surveying in instruments and get
 
00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:48.360 align:start position:0%
information into a computer database
 
00:09:51.509 --> 00:09:51.519 align:start position:0%
that database then feeds a different
 
00:09:54.069 --> 00:09:54.079 align:start position:0%
design system what we use today is
 
00:09:57.509 --> 00:09:57.519 align:start position:0%
called an open road system that's a
 
00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:00.320 align:start position:0%
Bentley product that's what we use to
 
00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:04.120 align:start position:0%
design on that information then goes to
 
00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:07.680 align:start position:0%
the contractors who have computer
 
00:10:11.069 --> 00:10:11.079 align:start position:0%
automated instruments on their equipment
 
00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
that helps them to build the project we
 
00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
then create as buils and then we take
 
00:10:19.949 --> 00:10:19.959 align:start position:0%
that information for things like pipes
 
00:10:23.389 --> 00:10:23.399 align:start position:0%
guard rail and others into an asset
 
00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
management system so what we have is
 
00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
many different systems some some work
 
00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:33.680 align:start position:0%
well together today some don't work so
 
00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:36.880 align:start position:0%
well together today what this project
 
00:10:39.509 --> 00:10:39.519 align:start position:0%
does is lets us look at all those
 
00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:43.360 align:start position:0%
different systems establish standards
 
00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:46.760 align:start position:0%
data standards so we can start to get
 
00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:49.480 align:start position:0%
these systems to work together and
 
00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:52.240 align:start position:0%
coordinate together to be more efficient
 
00:10:54.269 --> 00:10:54.279 align:start position:0%
and more
 
00:10:58.430 --> 00:10:58.440 align:start position:0%
effective follow up well the line item
 
00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
that the two .
 
00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:04.040 align:start position:0%
405 million dollar is in is Consultants
 
00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:07.120 align:start position:0%
yes and so is it a consultant for you
 
00:11:10.629 --> 00:11:10.639 align:start position:0%
guys is a consultant for it what am I
 
00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:14.480 align:start position:0%
saving because I'm spending $2 million
 
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
on Consultants how much am I saving to
 
00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:20.240 align:start position:0%
get so that it makes sense to spend that
 
00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:23.000 align:start position:0%
that 2.4 million right so the only way
 
00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:26.200 align:start position:0%
we can do this work today with our
 
00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:28.720 align:start position:0%
current resources and our current
 
00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:29.949 align:start position:0%
current resources and our current
knowledge

00:11:29.949 --> 00:11:29.959 align:start position:0%
knowledge
 
00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:33.200 align:start position:0%
is with Consultants there is a huge
 
00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:36.920 align:start position:0%
amount of work and expertise to look at
 
00:11:39.949 --> 00:11:39.959 align:start position:0%
this these disperate systems and work
 
00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:42.720 align:start position:0%
with those vendors to establish a
 
00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
standards that lets us um con collect
 
00:11:50.509 --> 00:11:50.519 align:start position:0%
and maintain the data consistently
 
00:11:52.949 --> 00:11:52.959 align:start position:0%
throughout the entire process it's
 
00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
really a lot of leg work and a lot of
 
00:11:58.750 --> 00:11:58.760 align:start position:0%
documentation of our standards that
 
00:12:01.509 --> 00:12:01.519 align:start position:0%
we're set setting up to to help us be
 
00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
more efficient and effective in the long
 
00:12:07.509 --> 00:12:07.519 align:start position:0%
run run this is all part of what we call
 
00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:10.360 align:start position:0%
building information modeling or
 
00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:13.320 align:start position:0%
building Information Management it's
 
00:12:16.069 --> 00:12:16.079 align:start position:0%
been used in vertical construction for
 
00:12:19.509 --> 00:12:19.519 align:start position:0%
many years Transportation or horizontal
 
00:12:22.389 --> 00:12:22.399 align:start position:0%
construction has been using it for the
 
00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
last 20 or so Years and we're getting
 
00:12:28.389 --> 00:12:28.399 align:start position:0%
better at it New Hampshire is in the
 
00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:30.680 align:start position:0%
middle to make maybe a little bit behind
 
00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:33.440 align:start position:0%
the pack for the rest of the Dos across
 
00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
the country this grant will help us
 
00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
catch up and set up our systems to help
 
00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:42.240 align:start position:0%
us be most effective for the next 10 or
 
00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
more years it'll take us 10 or more
 
00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
years to get to the end of this the
 
00:12:50.389 --> 00:12:50.399 align:start position:0%
other thing this standardization does is
 
00:12:53.389 --> 00:12:53.399 align:start position:0%
helps us very much with with our
 
00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:56.240 align:start position:0%
attrition and helps us work through as
 
00:12:59.430 --> 00:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
we lose people and bring new people on
 
00:13:02.069 --> 00:13:02.079 align:start position:0%
it makes sure we have a very well
 
00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:04.600 align:start position:0%
documented system that's easy for
 
00:13:07.629 --> 00:13:07.639 align:start position:0%
everybody to follow so the majority of
 
00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
this work is consultant driven it's in
 
00:13:13.389 --> 00:13:13.399 align:start position:0%
documenting standards and putting
 
00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:16.360 align:start position:0%
processes in place to help us be more
 
00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:21.160 align:start position:0%
effective so is this a one-time cost and
 
00:13:22.629 --> 00:13:22.639 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to see it in your budget
 
00:13:24.069 --> 00:13:24.079 align:start position:0%
when you come before me in a couple of
 
00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
months or is this an ongoing cost for
 
00:13:29.829 --> 00:13:29.839 align:start position:0%
consultants and again go back back to
 
00:13:32.829 --> 00:13:32.839 align:start position:0%
what I asked before is what's this going
 
00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:36.160 align:start position:0%
to save me if not going to save me I'm
 
00:13:39.389 --> 00:13:39.399 align:start position:0%
wondering why I'm doing it so so what
 
00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
it's I'll take the the question of what
 
00:13:44.629 --> 00:13:44.639 align:start position:0%
it's going to save you first what it's
 
00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:47.800 align:start position:0%
going to save you is making our systems
 
00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:51.560 align:start position:0%
more efficient so our Survey System
 
00:13:54.949 --> 00:13:54.959 align:start position:0%
speaks better to our design system that
 
00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:57.680 align:start position:0%
then speaks better to the contractor
 
00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:00.680 align:start position:0%
system that they use to control their
 
00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:03.160 align:start position:0%
their equipment their automation that
 
00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
all works off of satellites and and GIS
 
00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
so forth and then helps us collect that
 
00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:12.880 align:start position:0%
information or use that information into
 
00:14:16.389 --> 00:14:16.399 align:start position:0%
the future as we maintain that asset so
 
00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:18.880 align:start position:0%
we know for instance what piece of
 
00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:21.880 align:start position:0%
guardrail is where and what type of of
 
00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
guardrail it is right now we have to
 
00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:27.680 align:start position:0%
collect that as as a separate effort
 
00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
once we have this system in place
 
00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:32.440 align:start position:0%
there's no additional collection
 
00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:35.000 align:start position:0%
everything flows through the system
 
00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:38.800 align:start position:0%
automatically so that's the the savings
 
00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:42.040 align:start position:0%
it also when not we don't do that uh the
 
00:14:44.829 --> 00:14:44.839 align:start position:0%
best these days for Asset Management so
 
00:14:47.629 --> 00:14:47.639 align:start position:0%
this will help us improve our asset
 
00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:50.600 align:start position:0%
management capabilities and reduce our
 
00:14:54.829 --> 00:14:54.839 align:start position:0%
overall life cycle cost of our assets
 
00:14:57.509 --> 00:14:57.519 align:start position:0%
the reason we need Consultants to do it
 
00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
one is because they have the expertise
 
00:15:03.749 --> 00:15:03.759 align:start position:0%
we've Chosen and we're in the process of
 
00:15:06.629 --> 00:15:06.639 align:start position:0%
finalizing a selection of a contractor
 
00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
that or a consultant that has National
 
00:15:12.629 --> 00:15:12.639 align:start position:0%
expertise with this and the other reason
 
00:15:16.069 --> 00:15:16.079 align:start position:0%
is we don't have the people in house to
 
00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:18.880 align:start position:0%
to do it when we work with a consultant
 
00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:22.040 align:start position:0%
on a project like this I like to say we
 
00:15:25.269 --> 00:15:25.279 align:start position:0%
want them to teach us to fish not give
 
00:15:27.829 --> 00:15:27.839 align:start position:0%
us a fish so to answer your question are
 
00:15:31.189 --> 00:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
you are we going to do this same thing
 
00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:34.040 align:start position:0%
again and and bring it before your
 
00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
committee no we are not but overall this
 
00:15:41.509 --> 00:15:41.519 align:start position:0%
is an evolution so we're taking the
 
00:15:44.949 --> 00:15:44.959 align:start position:0%
first five or six very big steps with
 
00:15:47.509 --> 00:15:47.519 align:start position:0%
this with this consultant we will
 
00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:50.160 align:start position:0%
continue to refine our systems and make
 
00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:53.800 align:start position:0%
them better in the future follow
 
00:15:56.710 --> 00:15:56.720 align:start position:0%
up we still haven't hit the thing how
 
00:15:59.790 --> 00:15:59.800 align:start position:0%
much I'm going to save okay
 
00:16:02.629 --> 00:16:02.639 align:start position:0%
um certainly outside of this meeting I'm
 
00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
going to ask you for where I'm going to
 
00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
save them where I'm going to see those
 
00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:10.040 align:start position:0%
line items reduced in the budget that
 
00:16:14.309 --> 00:16:14.319 align:start position:0%
comes to me from the house um so again
 
00:16:19.509 --> 00:16:19.519 align:start position:0%
right now what I'm going to spend $3
 
00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:22.720 align:start position:0%
million 700 almost $800,000 on the
 
00:16:25.749 --> 00:16:25.759 align:start position:0%
equipment and stuff and then 2.4 million
 
00:16:28.389 --> 00:16:28.399 align:start position:0%
on the people where's the savings and
 
00:16:31.949 --> 00:16:31.959 align:start position:0%
how much right and and I don't have that
 
00:16:35.829 --> 00:16:35.839 align:start position:0%
in a per dollar item I don't expect that
 
00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:38.720 align:start position:0%
you're going to save that in the budget
 
00:16:41.949 --> 00:16:41.959 align:start position:0%
that we're going to bring forward to you
 
00:16:44.949 --> 00:16:44.959 align:start position:0%
I do expect in the long term the the
 
00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:48.800 align:start position:0%
state is going to save considerably by
 
00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
The increased efficiency that that this
 
00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
brings I'd be happy for you to to or I'd
 
00:16:57.790 --> 00:16:57.800 align:start position:0%
be happy to share some information about
 
00:16:59.470 --> 00:16:59.480 align:start position:0%
this system with you
 
00:17:02.629 --> 00:17:02.639 align:start position:0%
offline so we can get in more details
 
00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:04.640 align:start position:0%
when when they talk about the the
 
00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:06.760 align:start position:0%
Savings in this they talk about
 
00:17:10.029 --> 00:17:10.039 align:start position:0%
efficiencies of 10% here and
 
00:17:13.909 --> 00:17:13.919 align:start position:0%
15% here and I'd rather have some of
 
00:17:17.029 --> 00:17:17.039 align:start position:0%
that documentation to to share with you
 
00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:20.480 align:start position:0%
specifically oh return on investment Is
 
00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:23.400 align:start position:0%
Not A New Concept and no when you come
 
00:17:26.949 --> 00:17:26.959 align:start position:0%
in and spend $3 million and and 2.4 that
 
00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:30.400 align:start position:0%
is on Consultants it makes me wonder
 
00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
what the return on the dollar is so I've
 
00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:35.720 align:start position:0%
got to vote on this today yes okay which
 
00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
makes it difficult for me so I I hear
 
00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
you and I'm sorry to to put you in the
 
00:17:45.789 --> 00:17:45.799 align:start position:0%
position of having to trust me that th
 
00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:49.000 align:start position:0%
this helps us to make our operations
 
00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
significantly more more efficient and
 
00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:55.240 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm asking you to
 
00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:00.120 align:start position:0%
do representative F and then Senator k
 
00:18:02.669 --> 00:18:02.679 align:start position:0%
no I oh you're all set all right Senator
 
00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:04.840 align:start position:0%
Carson for a question thank you Mr
 
00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:08.240 align:start position:0%
chairman good morning um I have uh two
 
00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:11.080 align:start position:0%
questions is this project AI a high
 
00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:13.880 align:start position:0%
priority for you for the Department for
 
00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:17.360 align:start position:0%
for me personally this project is a a
 
00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:20.440 align:start position:0%
higher priority a high priority this is
 
00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:23.720 align:start position:0%
where we need to go today our CAD
 
00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:27.200 align:start position:0%
specialist bill Caswell has 40 years
 
00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:30.360 align:start position:0%
with the Department he has been involved
 
00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:34.280 align:start position:0%
in our CAD System since it started in
 
00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:38.320 align:start position:0%
1987 he is a leader in New Hampshire and
 
00:18:41.789 --> 00:18:41.799 align:start position:0%
uh around he he's with us for a very
 
00:18:46.149 --> 00:18:46.159 align:start position:0%
very short time this project documents
 
00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
everything that that bill knows our
 
00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:52.760 align:start position:0%
current practice and takes us forward to
 
00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
where we need to be in the evolution of
 
00:18:59.110 --> 00:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
how we design our our roadways so it is
 
00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:01.960 align:start position:0%
a very high priority this is a Federal
 
00:19:05.669 --> 00:19:05.679 align:start position:0%
grant this is a we will not have this
 
00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:08.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity that I know of in the future
 
00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:11.240 align:start position:0%
with State funds or with federal funds
 
00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:13.320 align:start position:0%
that we are putting towards our
 
00:19:15.669 --> 00:19:15.679 align:start position:0%
construction projects that's that's what
 
00:19:18.789 --> 00:19:18.799 align:start position:0%
we do in here to Senator Gray's point we
 
00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:21.200 align:start position:0%
want to give you a return on on our
 
00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
investment so we try to put all our
 
00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:26.120 align:start position:0%
money right towards the maintenance
 
00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:28.240 align:start position:0%
operations and reconstruction of the
 
00:19:31.149 --> 00:19:31.159 align:start position:0%
road this is an opportunity to move
 
00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:34.240 align:start position:0%
ahead from a process perspective and a
 
00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:35.909 align:start position:0%
ahead from a process perspective and a
technological

00:19:35.909 --> 00:19:35.919 align:start position:0%
technological
 
00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:38.120 align:start position:0%
perspective follow up thank you Mr
 
00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
chairman what is the timeline on this
 
00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
when do you expect to start and when is
 
00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:45.320 align:start position:0%
this project going to be finished we
 
00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
expect to start this year and it's a 3
 
00:19:51.789 --> 00:19:51.799 align:start position:0%
to four year duration so may I follow up
 
00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:55.280 align:start position:0%
so in speaking to Senator Grave's point
 
00:19:58.750 --> 00:19:58.760 align:start position:0%
we're not going to see any real return
 
00:20:01.029 --> 00:20:01.039 align:start position:0%
from this until four years
 
00:20:05.149 --> 00:20:05.159 align:start position:0%
out we every there there will be steps
 
00:20:07.909 --> 00:20:07.919 align:start position:0%
along the way that we will see benefits
 
00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
and improvements as we document our
 
00:20:14.029 --> 00:20:14.039 align:start position:0%
standards better along this this new
 
00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:17.080 align:start position:0%
process makes our communication with
 
00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
private surveyors with engineering
 
00:20:22.909 --> 00:20:22.919 align:start position:0%
consultants and with contractors better
 
00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:25.480 align:start position:0%
and better all the time so we'll see
 
00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:29.360 align:start position:0%
some some step in improvements thank you
 
00:20:31.549 --> 00:20:31.559 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman any other member
 
00:20:34.029 --> 00:20:34.039 align:start position:0%
of the committee Senator
 
00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
rosenal thank you Mr chairman was this a
 
00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:41.640 align:start position:0%
competitive Grant this was a competitive
 
00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:45.880 align:start position:0%
Grant thank you so when you tell us
 
00:20:48.029 --> 00:20:48.039 align:start position:0%
efficiency that either means the project
 
00:20:50.549 --> 00:20:50.559 align:start position:0%
will be done quicker or fewer people
 
00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:53.640 align:start position:0%
will be required and that's that's what
 
00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
we're expecting to see perhaps not
 
00:20:57.990 --> 00:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
immediately but hopefully long term
 
00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
you'll be able to
 
00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:02.600 align:start position:0%
definitely say this is as a result of
 
00:21:05.789 --> 00:21:05.799 align:start position:0%
the system and I am confident we will
 
00:21:09.149 --> 00:21:09.159 align:start position:0%
deliver those two two things and the
 
00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:12.360 align:start position:0%
third thing that that the these systems
 
00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:16.440 align:start position:0%
provide for us is an overall lower life
 
00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
cycle cost of our assets as we keep
 
00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:22.440 align:start position:0%
better track of them and as we manage
 
00:21:24.789 --> 00:21:24.799 align:start position:0%
them best best for the longest
 
00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
serviceable life thank you f
 
00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
um just so everybody knows where I am
 
00:21:35.549 --> 00:21:35.559 align:start position:0%
okay this is this is federal
 
00:21:38.149 --> 00:21:38.159 align:start position:0%
dollars I am going to make a motion at
 
00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:40.440 align:start position:0%
the end of this uh you know for
 
00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:43.200 align:start position:0%
acceptance uh but I will be wanting
 
00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
additional information when you present
 
00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
your budget before the Senate uh that
 
00:21:51.149 --> 00:21:51.159 align:start position:0%
tells me how I'm saving you know money
 
00:21:53.669 --> 00:21:53.679 align:start position:0%
because I'm spending this money and with
 
00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:57.200 align:start position:0%
that I will move the Autumn to approve
 
00:22:01.789 --> 00:22:01.799 align:start position:0%

but okay moving on to tab five on the

and that's item
 
00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:36.120 align:start position:0%
25054 that's the uh Department of Health
 
00:22:38.149 --> 00:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
and Human Services any questions on the
 
00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:39.720 align:start position:0%
item Senator

Rosenwald thank you see finance officer

minute thank you Mr chairman good
morning

00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:52.360 align:start position:0%
morning
 
00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:53.909 align:start position:0%
morning
Nathan

00:22:53.909 --> 00:22:53.919 align:start position:0%
Nathan
 
00:22:58.549 --> 00:22:58.559 align:start position:0%
um I think I understand why there was
 
00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:02.720 align:start position:0%
extra money in the Managed Care lines
 
00:23:06.269 --> 00:23:06.279 align:start position:0%
but I'm wondering if you could tell us
 
00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
why there's a $16 million shortfall in
 
00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:12.440 align:start position:0%
the children's health insurance program
 
00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:14.200 align:start position:0%
is it more
 
00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:18.200 align:start position:0%
kids that didn't fall off the program or
 
00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
is it sicker kids or a
 
00:23:23.909 --> 00:23:23.919 align:start position:0%
combination that just seems like a
 
00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
really big amount sure uh Nathan white
 
00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:29.480 align:start position:0%
chief officer of the Department of
 
00:23:30.789 --> 00:23:30.799 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services I'm going to
 
00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
have Henry Litman talk about some of the
 
00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:35.080 align:start position:0%
trends that we've seen um I do want to
 
00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
point out though that in the past for
 
00:23:39.549 --> 00:23:39.559 align:start position:0%
the last state fiscal year we also had
 
00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:42.440 align:start position:0%
to make a similar transfer uh in this it
 
00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
in this area to the chip
 
00:23:47.789 --> 00:23:47.799 align:start position:0%
program so historically the then the
 
00:23:49.870 --> 00:23:49.880 align:start position:0%
children's health insurance program and
 
00:23:51.310 --> 00:23:51.320 align:start position:0%
for the record by the way Henry Litman
 
00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:56.240 align:start position:0%
State Medicaid director um we um did not
 
00:23:58.430 --> 00:23:58.440 align:start position:0%
separately have a line item for
 
00:23:59.789 --> 00:23:59.799 align:start position:0%
children's health insurance program it
 
00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:02.520 align:start position:0%
was mixed into the Medicaid managed care
 
00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
we started to um budget it separately so
 
00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:08.440 align:start position:0%
we could track it better um then the
 
00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
pandemic kicked in and enrollment with
 
00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
continuous enrollment affected the
 
00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:17.360 align:start position:0%
because that happened after we budgeted
 
00:24:20.029 --> 00:24:20.039 align:start position:0%
for it and so we've been between that
 
00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:22.120 align:start position:0%
and now that there's continuous coverage
 
00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
the federal requirement that started
 
00:24:26.789 --> 00:24:26.799 align:start position:0%
January 1 of 24 to cover kids for 12
 
00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
months continuously the assumptions that
 
00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
we had you know in beginning to break
 
00:24:34.669 --> 00:24:34.679 align:start position:0%
out that component um we're sort of
 
00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:37.320 align:start position:0%
chasing that I think as we prepare the
 
00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
26 27 budget we now have the experience
 
00:24:42.110 --> 00:24:42.120 align:start position:0%
and understanding to budget that better
 
00:24:45.389 --> 00:24:45.399 align:start position:0%
but the the dollars if you will had that
 
00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:48.200 align:start position:0%
we budgeted in the entirety of the medic
 
00:24:50.149 --> 00:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
Managed Care Program were adequate to
 
00:24:52.549 --> 00:24:52.559 align:start position:0%
cover it's just Distributing it between
 
00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:54.520 align:start position:0%
the lines that's what's going on here
 
00:24:57.149 --> 00:24:57.159 align:start position:0%
and we'll have a better accurate
 
00:24:59.750 --> 00:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
distribution as we go forward
 
00:25:03.389 --> 00:25:03.399 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you but aren't children
 
00:25:08.389 --> 00:25:08.399 align:start position:0%
all fee for service no um children are
 
00:25:10.269 --> 00:25:10.279 align:start position:0%
nearly all are children that are in the
 
00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:12.120 align:start position:0%
health insurance component they're
 
00:25:15.269 --> 00:25:15.279 align:start position:0%
covered by managed care as
 
00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
um when we see your
 
00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
budget um
 
00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:31.120 align:start position:0%
are we going to
 
00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:35.320 align:start position:0%
see a a truer
 
00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:37.600 align:start position:0%
more I mean you're going to account for
 
00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
this $32
 
00:25:42.510 --> 00:25:42.520 align:start position:0%
million yes I think we won't have the
 
00:25:44.909 --> 00:25:44.919 align:start position:0%
the um the public health emergency
 
00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:46.760 align:start position:0%
Distortion of three and three and a half
 
00:25:49.029 --> 00:25:49.039 align:start position:0%
years of continuous enrollment we won't
 
00:25:52.110 --> 00:25:52.120 align:start position:0%
have the new federal policy coming in
 
00:25:53.789 --> 00:25:53.799 align:start position:0%
all those things affected the accuracy
 
00:25:57.350 --> 00:25:57.360 align:start position:0%
of our our budgeting um and but in the
 
00:25:59.110 --> 00:25:59.120 align:start position:0%
aggregate we got it very
 
00:26:01.029 --> 00:26:01.039 align:start position:0%
close thank
 
00:26:04.389 --> 00:26:04.399 align:start position:0%
you further from the committee
 
00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:08.360 align:start position:0%

25054 is there any further
 
00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none all in favor say
 
00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
I I oppose no the item is adopted moving
 
00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:22.480 align:start position:0%

a
 
00:26:37.909 --> 00:26:37.919 align:start position:0%
question introduce yourself
 
00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
please good morning everyone uh jorth
 
00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:42.520 align:start position:0%
general manager at Kon Mountain Frank
 
00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
con State Park thank you for coming
 
00:26:46.990 --> 00:26:47.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thanks for
 
00:26:49.789 --> 00:26:49.799 align:start position:0%
taking my question so in the letter that
 
00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:53.120 align:start position:0%
we received on January 31st roughly it
 
00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
talks about a slight adjustment and a
 
00:26:58.510 --> 00:26:58.520 align:start position:0%
moderate rate increase in offseason and
 
00:27:02.590 --> 00:27:02.600 align:start position:0%
and uh cost and I was a little puzzled
 
00:27:04.149 --> 00:27:04.159 align:start position:0%
maybe I've been looking at numbers too
 
00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
long in the last couple of days but uh
 
00:27:08.990 --> 00:27:09.000 align:start position:0%
looking at your tier one and tier two
 
00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
and early bird uh the pop of the second
 
00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
page I'm not quite following that I see
 
00:27:19.870 --> 00:27:19.880 align:start position:0%
that the winter 2425 is 799 and then it
 
00:27:24.149 --> 00:27:24.159 align:start position:0%
says early bird 799 off season 899 and
 
00:27:28.230 --> 00:27:28.240 align:start position:0%
then over to in season 999 is that the
 
00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:30.640 align:start position:0%
increase to 999
 
00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:34.760 align:start position:0%
for offseason or inseason purchase or
 
00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:36.360 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit more complicated than
 
00:27:38.789 --> 00:27:38.799 align:start position:0%
that um first of all on the menu that
 
00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:40.640 align:start position:0%
you're looking at you're looking at two
 
00:27:42.789 --> 00:27:42.799 align:start position:0%
sets of prices for two different seasons
 
00:27:45.549 --> 00:27:45.559 align:start position:0%
first of all um under the tab winter
 
00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
2024 25 and then with columns in tier
 
00:27:52.269 --> 00:27:52.279 align:start position:0%
one and tier 2 those are the prices for
 
00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:54.720 align:start position:0%
this current season's uh winter season
 
00:27:57.669 --> 00:27:57.679 align:start position:0%
passes and you can see the date ranges
 
00:28:00.269 --> 00:28:00.279 align:start position:0%
at which those um past prices are in
 
00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
effect and that's what essentially we
 
00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:05.200 align:start position:0%
mean by tier um The Proposal on this uh
 
00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:08.240 align:start position:0%
next winter seasons passes is under the
 
00:28:11.789 --> 00:28:11.799 align:start position:0%
tab winter 2025 2026 there's just some
 
00:28:15.029 --> 00:28:15.039 align:start position:0%
nomenclature change to the to the tiers
 
00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:16.480 align:start position:0%
um you know first of all what I'm
 
00:28:18.669 --> 00:28:18.679 align:start position:0%
calling early bird is essentially the
 
00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:21.640 align:start position:0%
same as tier one um and it'd be
 
00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:23.360 align:start position:0%
important to note that as part of The
 
00:28:25.990 --> 00:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
Proposal um I'm I'm proposing a price
 
00:28:28.149 --> 00:28:28.159 align:start position:0%
freeze when we go out to market for now
 
00:28:30.149 --> 00:28:30.159 align:start position:0%
next season's winter passes I want to
 
00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
keep all passes at exactly the same
 
00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:37.080 align:start position:0%
price um secondly the offseason tier is
 
00:28:39.389 --> 00:28:39.399 align:start position:0%
uh it's expanded somewhat um I would
 
00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:44.200 align:start position:0%
seek to initiate that price on May 1st
 
00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:46.360 align:start position:0%
and run it all the way through um
 
00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
November 28th um of of next year which
 
00:28:51.269 --> 00:28:51.279 align:start position:0%
is when our anticipated opening date
 
00:28:54.509 --> 00:28:54.519 align:start position:0%
will be and then I think importantly is
 
00:28:57.070 --> 00:28:57.080 align:start position:0%
um I I have advocated and proposed to
 
00:28:58.789 --> 00:28:58.799 align:start position:0%
this committee that creation and
 
00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:00.840 align:start position:0%
delineation of a third tier for us
 
00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:01.630 align:start position:0%
delineation of a third tier for us
called

00:29:01.630 --> 00:29:01.640 align:start position:0%
called
 
00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:04.240 align:start position:0%
inseason um inseason passes are
 
00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
presently sold at Canon Mountain for
 
00:29:08.830 --> 00:29:08.840 align:start position:0%
sure and they essentially occupy what is
 
00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
presently our tier 2 rates um but I view
 
00:29:14.830 --> 00:29:14.840 align:start position:0%
it as critical and also consistent with
 
00:29:17.549 --> 00:29:17.559 align:start position:0%
uh the industry to create an inseason
 
00:29:21.149 --> 00:29:21.159 align:start position:0%
tier um and a subsequent price increase
 
00:29:23.789 --> 00:29:23.799 align:start position:0%
there uh this is done pretty commonly at
 
00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:25.480 align:start position:0%
a at a host of other mountains including
 
00:29:29.310 --> 00:29:29.320 align:start position:0%
in the state um most notably Gunstock
 
00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:33.200 align:start position:0%
ragged um some of our a mountain that is
 
00:29:36.509 --> 00:29:36.519 align:start position:0%
very similar to Canon uh J peak in
 
00:29:39.149 --> 00:29:39.159 align:start position:0%
Vermont operates very similarly and the
 
00:29:42.430 --> 00:29:42.440 align:start position:0%
idea behind this um sir is that uh you
 
00:29:44.509 --> 00:29:44.519 align:start position:0%
know as much as we can do to drive
 
00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:48.120 align:start position:0%
Advanced commitment um this is a tried
 
00:29:51.509 --> 00:29:51.519 align:start position:0%
andrue strategy to offer guests um and
 
00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:53.200 align:start position:0%
passholders the opportunity to purchase
 
00:29:56.430 --> 00:29:56.440 align:start position:0%
earlier at a discounted rate and uh
 
00:29:59.029 --> 00:29:59.039 align:start position:0%
encourage um folks prior to the season
 
00:30:02.190 --> 00:30:02.200 align:start position:0%
beginning to jump on the program so that
 
00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:04.120 align:start position:0%
would be a change pretty much as you
 
00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
look at the 2025 2026 um prices you'll
 
00:30:10.389 --> 00:30:10.399 align:start position:0%
see that early bird tier where when we
 
00:30:12.669 --> 00:30:12.679 align:start position:0%
would go on sale again those prices are
 
00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
Frozen um secondly as we go to the off
 
00:30:17.669 --> 00:30:17.679 align:start position:0%
season tier um the majority of those
 
00:30:22.909 --> 00:30:22.919 align:start position:0%
prices are I propose um to go up by 1.8%
 
00:30:25.509 --> 00:30:25.519 align:start position:0%
there's one tier in there the uh u29
 
00:30:28.549 --> 00:30:28.559 align:start position:0%
Group which I propose to go up 3.8
 
00:30:32.029 --> 00:30:32.039 align:start position:0%
% um but otherwise it's 1.8% across the
 
00:30:35.029 --> 00:30:35.039 align:start position:0%
board and no changes to military or
 
00:30:36.669 --> 00:30:36.679 align:start position:0%
special use passes like our uphill
 
00:30:40.029 --> 00:30:40.039 align:start position:0%
passes on any tier and then thirdly is
 
00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
on that inseason tier with its creation
 
00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
this would be valid um there's there's
 
00:30:47.029 --> 00:30:47.039 align:start position:0%
two important notes for Canon only
 
00:30:48.990 --> 00:30:49.000 align:start position:0%
passes these are for folks who are not
 
00:30:51.310 --> 00:30:51.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents that would go
 
00:30:55.149 --> 00:30:55.159 align:start position:0%
into effect on November 28th when um we
 
00:30:58.269 --> 00:30:58.279 align:start position:0%
anticipate being open and then for new
 
00:31:01.629 --> 00:31:01.639 align:start position:0%
residents um that inseason tier would
 
00:31:05.789 --> 00:31:05.799 align:start position:0%
take effect um after the RSA deadline so
 
00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:07.610 align:start position:0%
um as prescribed
 
00:31:07.610 --> 00:31:08.710 align:start position:0%
um as prescribed
[Music]

00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:08.720 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:31:14.110 --> 00:31:14.120 align:start position:0%
in um RSA 227 colon 14 reduce rates um
 
00:31:16.190 --> 00:31:16.200 align:start position:0%
there's the prescription for me as the
 
00:31:18.269 --> 00:31:18.279 align:start position:0%
mountain manager to offer discounted
 
00:31:20.110 --> 00:31:20.120 align:start position:0%
rates on season passes through December
 
00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:22.960 align:start position:0%
14th to New Hampshire residence that's
 
00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:27.000 align:start position:0%
commonly done um same thing here uh but
 
00:31:29.389 --> 00:31:29.399 align:start position:0%
our inseason for New Hampshire resident
 
00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
passes would then uh begin uh December
 
00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
15th that is also consistent with what
 
00:31:38.629 --> 00:31:38.639 align:start position:0%
we do presently um I just wanted to make
 
00:31:40.789 --> 00:31:40.799 align:start position:0%
sure it was is clear and and for you all
 
00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:43.200 align:start position:0%
to consider I hope that answered your
 
00:31:46.710 --> 00:31:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:49.509 --> 00:31:49.519 align:start position:0%
up I guess I'm concerned if I'm the
 
00:31:51.269 --> 00:31:51.279 align:start position:0%
resident here in New Hampshire and I log
 
00:31:54.029 --> 00:31:54.039 align:start position:0%
on to your site that I can say well gee
 
00:31:55.789 --> 00:31:55.799 align:start position:0%
if I buy my ticket now it's going to
 
00:31:59.669 --> 00:31:59.679 align:start position:0%
cost this much if I buy my ticket next
 
00:32:02.669 --> 00:32:02.679 align:start position:0%
season for The Following Season how much
 
00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:04.880 align:start position:0%
it's going to be it just seems it's it's
 
00:32:07.870 --> 00:32:07.880 align:start position:0%
not as clear but maybe it's just me but
 
00:32:11.310 --> 00:32:11.320 align:start position:0%
um I think uh for some additional
 
00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
context one thing that I see in terms of
 
00:32:16.389 --> 00:32:16.399 align:start position:0%
uh our pass unit sales the vast majority
 
00:32:18.669 --> 00:32:18.679 align:start position:0%
of our pass unit sales for Canon only
 
00:32:20.629 --> 00:32:20.639 align:start position:0%
passes these are mostly out of state
 
00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
visitors um those occur during um the
 
00:32:26.669 --> 00:32:26.679 align:start position:0%
spring and summer um that's when the
 
00:32:28.470 --> 00:32:28.480 align:start position:0%
vast majority of those are sold pretty
 
00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
much the same with New Hampshire
 
00:32:32.269 --> 00:32:32.279 align:start position:0%
resident passes although we do see a
 
00:32:33.950 --> 00:32:33.960 align:start position:0%
number of New Hampshire residents
 
00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:35.880 align:start position:0%
there's a larger percentage of them that
 
00:32:37.909 --> 00:32:37.919 align:start position:0%
buy later in the season and particularly
 
00:32:41.389 --> 00:32:41.399 align:start position:0%
in season so I I couldn't explain
 
00:32:43.669 --> 00:32:43.679 align:start position:0%
exactly why that is to you other than
 
00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
the fact that our New Hampshire
 
00:32:47.509 --> 00:32:47.519 align:start position:0%
residents tend to like buying season
 
00:32:47.519 --> 00:32:48.950 align:start position:0%
residents tend to like buying season
passes

00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
passes
 
00:32:51.269 --> 00:32:51.279 align:start position:0%
later okay well thanks thank you Mr
 
00:32:54.149 --> 00:32:54.159 align:start position:0%
chairman further from the committee how
 
00:32:56.269 --> 00:32:56.279 align:start position:0%
much have your operating costs gone up
 
00:32:58.710 --> 00:32:58.720 align:start position:0%
year-over year
 
00:33:01.789 --> 00:33:01.799 align:start position:0%
uh well uh you know anywhere between 5
 
00:33:05.470 --> 00:33:05.480 align:start position:0%
and 11% um we were aided by a
 
00:33:07.669 --> 00:33:07.679 align:start position:0%
renegotiation of a favor well an
 
00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:10.480 align:start position:0%
unfavorable utility contract we were uh
 
00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:12.760 align:start position:0%
able to get a new rate coming into this
 
00:33:15.870 --> 00:33:15.880 align:start position:0%
year so some of the impacts to Canon's
 
00:33:18.549 --> 00:33:18.559 align:start position:0%
budget which had affected the place um
 
00:33:20.350 --> 00:33:20.360 align:start position:0%
pretty unfavorably in the last two years
 
00:33:22.990 --> 00:33:23.000 align:start position:0%
have been corrected um with some further
 
00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:24.720 align:start position:0%
cost control and some contemporary
 
00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:27.960 align:start position:0%
financial management practices um you
 
00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:29.880 align:start position:0%
know we've sought to certainly control
 
00:33:32.629 --> 00:33:32.639 align:start position:0%
but we certainly see the impact of uh
 
00:33:35.310 --> 00:33:35.320 align:start position:0%
inflation um wage compression there were
 
00:33:37.029 --> 00:33:37.039 align:start position:0%
a number of wage increases that were
 
00:33:39.789 --> 00:33:39.799 align:start position:0%
authorized um at the park service and
 
00:33:41.149 --> 00:33:41.159 align:start position:0%
then at Canam Mountain within the last
 
00:33:43.629 --> 00:33:43.639 align:start position:0%
couple of years so it's important for us
 
00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
to uh maintain our level of uh of
 
00:33:50.509 --> 00:33:50.519 align:start position:0%
self-sufficiency um in our rates while
 
00:33:52.590 --> 00:33:52.600 align:start position:0%
also maintaining our position as a value
 
00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
leader in the
 
00:33:58.470 --> 00:33:58.480 align:start position:0%
market how's your snow been um this is
 
00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh this is probably the best the
 
00:34:02.789 --> 00:34:02.799 align:start position:0%
mountain has looked in several years um
 
00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
we have uh 99% of the mountain open um
 
00:34:07.950 --> 00:34:07.960 align:start position:0%
we're above median in terms of natural
 
00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:10.720 align:start position:0%
snowfall we've had uh huge success with
 
00:34:13.990 --> 00:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
snowmaking this year um the conditions
 
00:34:16.190 --> 00:34:16.200 align:start position:0%
have been uh really remarkable uh
 
00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:19.320 align:start position:0%
visitation been up revenues are up um
 
00:34:22.829 --> 00:34:22.839 align:start position:0%
costs are down um slightly and I think
 
00:34:24.589 --> 00:34:24.599 align:start position:0%
it's all really positive I think most
 
00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:26.040 align:start position:0%
notably I also wanted to share with the
 
00:34:29.389 --> 00:34:29.399 align:start position:0%
committee we uh we conduct um post visit
 
00:34:32.109 --> 00:34:32.119 align:start position:0%
surveys with all guests where we just we
 
00:34:33.869 --> 00:34:33.879 align:start position:0%
try to Benchmark ourselves against the
 
00:34:37.069 --> 00:34:37.079 align:start position:0%
industry and a host of uh metrics um
 
00:34:39.829 --> 00:34:39.839 align:start position:0%
National Skies Association releases a
 
00:34:41.710 --> 00:34:41.720 align:start position:0%
report called the key report where
 
00:34:44.909 --> 00:34:44.919 align:start position:0%
they look at industry benchmarks and in
 
00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
particular um they they asked the
 
00:34:49.069 --> 00:34:49.079 align:start position:0%
question and and we can pay ourselves
 
00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:50.280 align:start position:0%
against the question of what is the
 
00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
value for price paid of the products we
 
00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
asked that specific question of all of
 
00:34:57.710 --> 00:34:57.720 align:start position:0%
our product holders from day tickets um
 
00:35:00.750 --> 00:35:00.760 align:start position:0%
beginner tickets pass holders Etc Canon
 
00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:03.040 align:start position:0%
is in a very strong position as it
 
00:35:05.109 --> 00:35:05.119 align:start position:0%
relates to value for price paid right
 
00:35:08.790 --> 00:35:08.800 align:start position:0%
now we uh Trend at about an average of
 
00:35:12.109 --> 00:35:12.119 align:start position:0%
8.3 um out of 10 versus a regional
 
00:35:15.069 --> 00:35:15.079 align:start position:0%
Northeast industry average of eight so
 
00:35:17.589 --> 00:35:17.599 align:start position:0%
folks who especially
 
00:35:19.990 --> 00:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
passholders um highly utilize the
 
00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:24.160 align:start position:0%
mountain um they view it as a good value
 
00:35:26.430 --> 00:35:26.440 align:start position:0%
and um we're trending above our industry
 
00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:28.230 align:start position:0%
and um we're trending above our industry
peers

00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:28.240 align:start position:0%

00:36:29.790 --> 00:36:29.800 align:start position:0%
um you know I know the struggle over
 
00:36:32.589 --> 00:36:32.599 align:start position:0%
many years on Staffing and so forth and
 
00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
um I wanted to get a s a couple sense of
 
00:36:38.470 --> 00:36:38.480 align:start position:0%
a couple things for you um H how do you
 
00:36:40.829 --> 00:36:40.839 align:start position:0%
see the trends in Your Capacity to hire
 
00:36:43.710 --> 00:36:43.720 align:start position:0%
the staff you need and then secondly I
 
00:36:46.109 --> 00:36:46.119 align:start position:0%
noticed you've got 116 eligible for
 
00:36:48.190 --> 00:36:48.200 align:start position:0%
retirement and I you know it went the
 
00:36:49.790 --> 00:36:49.800 align:start position:0%
retirements went up a little bit when Co
 
00:36:51.230 --> 00:36:51.240 align:start position:0%
started and they're down a little bit
 
00:36:54.510 --> 00:36:54.520 align:start position:0%
and so on but um what do you anticipate
 
00:36:57.630 --> 00:36:57.640 align:start position:0%
in terms of that fairly large group um
 
00:36:59.069 --> 00:36:59.079 align:start position:0%
and what pressure that's going to put on
 
00:37:01.750 --> 00:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
you to have successful
 
00:37:03.670 --> 00:37:03.680 align:start position:0%
recruitment thank you for that question
 
00:37:05.510 --> 00:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
Senator the
 
00:37:07.990 --> 00:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
117 uh at the time of this report which
 
00:37:12.390 --> 00:37:12.400 align:start position:0%
was uh 123 2025 in fresh numbers this
 
00:37:14.910 --> 00:37:14.920 align:start position:0%
morning we have 107 who are in that
 
00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
retirement eligible uh category 60 of
 
00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
them are sworn law enforcement and of
 
00:37:23.870 --> 00:37:23.880 align:start position:0%
the 107 36 of them have 25 plus years or
 
00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
more of service I think it's a very um
 
00:37:29.390 --> 00:37:29.400 align:start position:0%
hard prediction uh to figure out uh how
 
00:37:31.950 --> 00:37:31.960 align:start position:0%
many may or may not choose to retire I
 
00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
think it's very also clear as the topic
 
00:37:38.750 --> 00:37:38.760 align:start position:0%
of group two retirement uh occurs if the
 
00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
retirement system is adjusted again more
 
00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:43.480 align:start position:0%
favorably we will see an uptick in the
 
00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
number of people who choose to retire
 
00:37:46.750 --> 00:37:46.760 align:start position:0%
and deservedly so given the hours
 
00:37:48.150 --> 00:37:48.160 align:start position:0%
they've put forward to the state of New
 
00:37:51.309 --> 00:37:51.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um but the promising number is
 
00:37:53.470 --> 00:37:53.480 align:start position:0%
watching our Trends in Recruitment and
 
00:37:55.470 --> 00:37:55.480 align:start position:0%
we continue to recruit and work to
 
00:37:57.750 --> 00:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
retain all of our staff across all of
 
00:37:59.069 --> 00:37:59.079 align:start position:0%
the professionals it takes to run the
 
00:38:00.829 --> 00:38:00.839 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections and just in
 
00:38:03.309 --> 00:38:03.319 align:start position:0%
the numbers we've hired uh three more
 
00:38:05.190 --> 00:38:05.200 align:start position:0%
since I uh sent the data so we're up to
 
00:38:07.109 --> 00:38:07.119 align:start position:0%
a total of 33 just in our law
 
00:38:10.349 --> 00:38:10.359 align:start position:0%
enforcement ranks and we have 32 or
 
00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:12.720 align:start position:0%
excuse me 34 in the cube so we're just
 
00:38:15.349 --> 00:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
being much more aggressive and assertive
 
00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:17.400 align:start position:0%
um recruiting for the same uh entry
 
00:38:18.670 --> 00:38:18.680 align:start position:0%
level individuals that all law
 
00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
enforcement does across the state of New
 
00:38:23.109 --> 00:38:23.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I may follow up follow so I
 
00:38:25.589 --> 00:38:25.599 align:start position:0%
mean this much what we're doing today is
 
00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
about the overtime and fairly not not
 
00:38:32.109 --> 00:38:32.119 align:start position:0%
not unexpected um but is do you have any
 
00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
sense about the relationship between the
 
00:38:37.430 --> 00:38:37.440 align:start position:0%
um you know what we're going to see
 
00:38:41.470 --> 00:38:41.480 align:start position:0%
trending on that overtime number uh
 
00:38:43.870 --> 00:38:43.880 align:start position:0%
based on what you see trending as your
 
00:38:46.750 --> 00:38:46.760 align:start position:0%
capacity to fill full-time positions
 
00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
Senator if our capacity to continue to
 
00:38:50.349 --> 00:38:50.359 align:start position:0%
recruit which is what I've always
 
00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
advocated for happens we are going to
 
00:38:56.990 --> 00:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
stay steady and continue to um mitigate
 
00:38:58.630 --> 00:38:58.640 align:start position:0%
anybody body's deserved retirement or
 
00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:01.200 align:start position:0%
departure from the agency I I did send
 
00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
out to house finance and others and I
 
00:39:04.950 --> 00:39:04.960 align:start position:0%
think it's important to note that the
 
00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:06.880 align:start position:0%
number of overtime hours is actually
 
00:39:09.069 --> 00:39:09.079 align:start position:0%
decreased so as we've recruited
 
00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
individuals and our population has
 
00:39:14.030 --> 00:39:14.040 align:start position:0%
declined so we've shut down and kept one
 
00:39:16.030 --> 00:39:16.040 align:start position:0%
whole floor shut down in one of our
 
00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:18.720 align:start position:0%
larger general population housing units
 
00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:20.480 align:start position:0%
that means there's 14 posts that we
 
00:39:22.910 --> 00:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
don't fill every day of the year I think
 
00:39:24.550 --> 00:39:24.560 align:start position:0%
another important piece we don't talk
 
00:39:26.109 --> 00:39:26.119 align:start position:0%
enough about is we've reduced our
 
00:39:27.910 --> 00:39:27.920 align:start position:0%
reincarceration rate we literally have
 
00:39:31.230 --> 00:39:31.240 align:start position:0%
reduced the number of people by 8% in 7
 
00:39:33.230 --> 00:39:33.240 align:start position:0%
years who come back to incarceration
 
00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:35.640 align:start position:0%
that represents just roughly under 20000
 
00:39:37.109 --> 00:39:37.119 align:start position:0%
people who have not come back to
 
00:39:39.270 --> 00:39:39.280 align:start position:0%
incarceration if you look at the daily
 
00:39:41.150 --> 00:39:41.160 align:start position:0%
incarceration rate which is
 
00:39:44.829 --> 00:39:44.839 align:start position:0%
$252 a day that's approximately $90,000
 
00:39:46.069 --> 00:39:46.079 align:start position:0%
of the Department of Corrections has
 
00:39:48.550 --> 00:39:48.560 align:start position:0%
saved the state in just individuals not
 
00:39:50.990 --> 00:39:51.000 align:start position:0%
returning to incarceration you do that
 
00:39:52.230 --> 00:39:52.240 align:start position:0%
multiplication that's somewhere around
 
00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
$14 million so it's really the totality
 
00:39:56.990 --> 00:39:57.000 align:start position:0%
of everything we're doing in the
 
00:39:59.390 --> 00:39:59.400 align:start position:0%
department both in recruitment treatment
 
00:40:01.150 --> 00:40:01.160 align:start position:0%
and programming and being truly the
 
00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:03.720 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections and as long as
 
00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
we're funded and continue that effort
 
00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
we're headed in the right direction on
 
00:40:09.270 --> 00:40:09.280 align:start position:0%

Roman Nal I our objective was to
 
00:43:19.549 --> 00:43:19.559 align:start position:0%
determine whether the commission
 
00:43:20.990 --> 00:43:21.000 align:start position:0%
efficiently and effectively enforced
 
00:43:23.230 --> 00:43:23.240 align:start position:0%
laws against discrimination when
 
00:43:25.910 --> 00:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
receiving investigating and making
 
00:43:28.150 --> 00:43:28.160 align:start position:0%
findings on complaints
 
00:43:29.829 --> 00:43:29.839 align:start position:0%
our audit period was State fiscal years
 
00:43:32.069 --> 00:43:32.079 align:start position:0%
2020 through
 
00:43:34.230 --> 00:43:34.240 align:start position:0%
2023 please turn to our executive
 
00:43:36.630 --> 00:43:36.640 align:start position:0%
summary on page one which describes the
 
00:43:38.670 --> 00:43:38.680 align:start position:0%
results of our
 
00:43:40.710 --> 00:43:40.720 align:start position:0%
audit we found the commission was
 
00:43:42.750 --> 00:43:42.760 align:start position:0%
inefficient and ineffective in
 
00:43:44.549 --> 00:43:44.559 align:start position:0%
investigating complaints and closing
 
00:43:47.549 --> 00:43:47.559 align:start position:0%
cases in a timely manner we also found
 
00:43:49.030 --> 00:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
the commission had not established a
 
00:43:51.270 --> 00:43:51.280 align:start position:0%
method to measure its Effectiveness such
 
00:43:53.870 --> 00:43:53.880 align:start position:0%
as tracking how long it took to process
 
00:43:56.309 --> 00:43:56.319 align:start position:0%
cases Effectiveness was negatively
 
00:43:57.950 --> 00:43:57.960 align:start position:0%
impacted by EXP spired administrative
 
00:44:00.109 --> 00:44:00.119 align:start position:0%
rules lengthy investigations and
 
00:44:00.119 --> 00:44:01.589 align:start position:0%
rules lengthy investigations and
inadequate

00:44:01.589 --> 00:44:01.599 align:start position:0%
inadequate
 
00:44:04.069 --> 00:44:04.079 align:start position:0%
training tools for managing extensions
 
00:44:06.510 --> 00:44:06.520 align:start position:0%
and other delays from parties appearing
 
00:44:09.470 --> 00:44:09.480 align:start position:0%
before the commission had also not been
 
00:44:11.470 --> 00:44:11.480 align:start position:0%
established we found the commission had
 
00:44:13.069 --> 00:44:13.079 align:start position:0%
long-standing issues that had not been
 
00:44:15.670 --> 00:44:15.680 align:start position:0%
adequately addressed case backlogs from
 
00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
as early as 1984 continue through the
 
00:44:21.109 --> 00:44:21.119 align:start position:0%
present day the legislature took steps
 
00:44:23.109 --> 00:44:23.119 align:start position:0%
to address the backlog in state fiscal
 
00:44:26.069 --> 00:44:26.079 align:start position:0%
year 2024 by adding four investigator
 
00:44:27.630 --> 00:44:27.640 align:start position:0%
positions and two administrative
 
00:44:29.870 --> 00:44:29.880 align:start position:0%
positions but filling these positions
 
00:44:32.710 --> 00:44:32.720 align:start position:0%
has been slow due to continued staff
 
00:44:35.190 --> 00:44:35.200 align:start position:0%
turnover case backlogs were worsened by
 
00:44:36.710 --> 00:44:36.720 align:start position:0%
the assignment of investigators to
 
00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:39.480 align:start position:0%
non-investing tasks when administrative
 
00:44:41.990 --> 00:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
positions were unfilled or
 
00:44:44.069 --> 00:44:44.079 align:start position:0%
unfunded we found a lack of basic
 
00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
management controls such as establishing
 
00:44:48.990 --> 00:44:49.000 align:start position:0%
a strategic plan identifying objectives
 
00:44:51.510 --> 00:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
developing per performance measures and
 
00:44:53.150 --> 00:44:53.160 align:start position:0%
identifying and responding to
 
00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:54.750 align:start position:0%
identifying and responding to
operational

00:44:54.750 --> 00:44:54.760 align:start position:0%
operational
 
00:44:57.069 --> 00:44:57.079 align:start position:0%
risks we also found policies and
 
00:44:58.390 --> 00:44:58.400 align:start position:0%
procedures for investigators and
 
00:45:01.030 --> 00:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
Commissioners were deficient the manuals
 
00:45:02.470 --> 00:45:02.480 align:start position:0%
used to communicate policies and
 
00:45:04.510 --> 00:45:04.520 align:start position:0%
procedures were disorganized contain
 
00:45:06.670 --> 00:45:06.680 align:start position:0%
typographical errors and referenced
 
00:45:08.829 --> 00:45:08.839 align:start position:0%
outdated statutes court rulings and
 
00:45:08.839 --> 00:45:10.150 align:start position:0%
outdated statutes court rulings and
expired

00:45:10.150 --> 00:45:10.160 align:start position:0%
expired
 
00:45:12.069 --> 00:45:12.079 align:start position:0%
rules the commission did not have
 
00:45:14.390 --> 00:45:14.400 align:start position:0%
reliable program data on which to base
 
00:45:15.870 --> 00:45:15.880 align:start position:0%
its operational
 
00:45:18.109 --> 00:45:18.119 align:start position:0%
decisions case data were maintained
 
00:45:19.790 --> 00:45:19.800 align:start position:0%
manually in several spreadsheets and
 
00:45:22.270 --> 00:45:22.280 align:start position:0%
publicly reported data were
 
00:45:24.549 --> 00:45:24.559 align:start position:0%
inaccurate finally we found several
 
00:45:27.030 --> 00:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
findings from our 2019 Financial audit
 
00:45:29.030 --> 00:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
report remained
 
00:45:31.230 --> 00:45:31.240 align:start position:0%
unresolved for example the commission's
 
00:45:33.589 --> 00:45:33.599 align:start position:0%
administrative rules had expired in
 
00:45:36.230 --> 00:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
2015 this was cited as a deficiency in
 
00:45:38.910 --> 00:45:38.920 align:start position:0%
our 2019 Financial audit yet the
 
00:45:40.750 --> 00:45:40.760 align:start position:0%
commission's rules remain unexpired to
 
00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:41.510 align:start position:0%
commission's rules remain unexpired to
this

00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:45:45.150 --> 00:45:45.160 align:start position:0%
day by banial reports had not been filed
 
00:45:47.190 --> 00:45:47.200 align:start position:0%
during the audit period additionally
 
00:45:48.430 --> 00:45:48.440 align:start position:0%
statements of financial interest
 
00:45:50.270 --> 00:45:50.280 align:start position:0%
required by Statute had not been filed
 
00:45:52.190 --> 00:45:52.200 align:start position:0%
by some Commissioners or had not been
 
00:45:54.390 --> 00:45:54.400 align:start position:0%
complet completed
 
00:45:56.470 --> 00:45:56.480 align:start position:0%
correctly our recommendation summary
 
00:45:59.910 --> 00:45:59.920 align:start position:0%
begins on page three and contains 20 25
 
00:46:01.589 --> 00:46:01.599 align:start position:0%
observations with
 
00:46:03.309 --> 00:46:03.319 align:start position:0%
recommendations the commission fully
 
00:46:05.069 --> 00:46:05.079 align:start position:0%
concurred with 24 observations and
 
00:46:07.630 --> 00:46:07.640 align:start position:0%
concurred in part with one observation
 
00:46:10.309 --> 00:46:10.319 align:start position:0%
two recommendations numbers 10 and 13
 
00:46:12.470 --> 00:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
may require legislative
 
00:46:15.150 --> 00:46:15.160 align:start position:0%
action turning to page

00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
commission's case process as you can see
 
00:46:31.990 --> 00:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
there are numerous steps in the process
 
00:46:33.950 --> 00:46:33.960 align:start position:0%
contributing to the time it takes to
 
00:46:36.109 --> 00:46:36.119 align:start position:0%
process a
 
00:46:38.589 --> 00:46:38.599 align:start position:0%

cases and table one on page 14 notes the
 
00:46:49.349 --> 00:46:49.359 align:start position:0%
commission's revenues and expenditures
 
00:46:51.670 --> 00:46:51.680 align:start position:0%
for the audit
 
00:46:53.710 --> 00:46:53.720 align:start position:0%
period I'd like to take a minute to
 
00:46:56.309 --> 00:46:56.319 align:start position:0%
discuss observation number one on page
 
00:46:56.319 --> 00:46:57.510 align:start position:0%
discuss observation number one on page
17

00:46:57.510 --> 00:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
17
 
00:46:58.750 --> 00:46:58.760 align:start position:0%
due to its significance to the
 
00:47:00.589 --> 00:47:00.599 align:start position:0%
commission and our audit
 
00:47:02.750 --> 00:47:02.760 align:start position:0%
objectives this observation discusses
 
00:47:03.829 --> 00:47:03.839 align:start position:0%
the average length of time the
 
00:47:05.589 --> 00:47:05.599 align:start position:0%
commission took to process
 
00:47:08.309 --> 00:47:08.319 align:start position:0%
cases figure three on page
 
00:47:11.270 --> 00:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
18 shows case processing time through
 
00:47:12.910 --> 00:47:12.920 align:start position:0%
various stages of the commission's
 
00:47:15.230 --> 00:47:15.240 align:start position:0%
process it's important to note not every
 
00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
case follows the same path some cases
 
00:47:20.150 --> 00:47:20.160 align:start position:0%
are withdrawn after filing or they could
 
00:47:22.309 --> 00:47:22.319 align:start position:0%
go through the entire process uh and
 
00:47:25.109 --> 00:47:25.119 align:start position:0%
have a public hearing cases can also be
 
00:47:26.510 --> 00:47:26.520 align:start position:0%
delayed if the parties to the case
 
00:47:29.230 --> 00:47:29.240 align:start position:0%
request more time the commission could
 
00:47:31.230 --> 00:47:31.240 align:start position:0%
administratively close a case under some
 
00:47:33.109 --> 00:47:33.119 align:start position:0%
circumstances such as the death of a
 
00:47:35.030 --> 00:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
complainant while the case is in is with
 
00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:35.829 align:start position:0%
complainant while the case is in is with
the

00:47:35.829 --> 00:47:35.839 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:47:37.790 --> 00:47:37.800 align:start position:0%
commission all these factors should be
 
00:47:39.430 --> 00:47:39.440 align:start position:0%
taken into consideration when I discuss
 
00:47:41.150 --> 00:47:41.160 align:start position:0%
average time
 
00:47:44.589 --> 00:47:44.599 align:start position:0%
frames figure three shows it took an
 
00:47:47.390 --> 00:47:47.400 align:start position:0%
average of 840 days or 2.3 years between
 
00:47:49.589 --> 00:47:49.599 align:start position:0%
case filing and case
 
00:47:51.750 --> 00:47:51.760 align:start position:0%
closure our Figures were calculated
 
00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
based on 228 cases with data sufficient
 
00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:55.030 align:start position:0%
based on 228 cases with data sufficient
for

00:47:55.030 --> 00:47:55.040 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:47:57.670 --> 00:47:57.680 align:start position:0%
analysis figure three also shows the
 
00:47:59.549 --> 00:47:59.559 align:start position:0%
time from case filing to investigator
 
00:48:00.990 --> 00:48:01.000 align:start position:0%
assignment for a subset of cases
 
00:48:04.710 --> 00:48:04.720 align:start position:0%
averaged 557 days or 1 and A2
 
00:48:07.510 --> 00:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
years following investigator assignment
 
00:48:09.309 --> 00:48:09.319 align:start position:0%
a case could take two different paths
 
00:48:10.870 --> 00:48:10.880 align:start position:0%
one of which is to proceed to a probable
 
00:48:13.230 --> 00:48:13.240 align:start position:0%
cause determination which on average
 
00:48:16.829 --> 00:48:16.839 align:start position:0%
took 398 days after the investigator was
 
00:48:19.150 --> 00:48:19.160 align:start position:0%
assigned if a case was closed after
 
00:48:20.630 --> 00:48:20.640 align:start position:0%
investigator assignment but before
 
00:48:22.829 --> 00:48:22.839 align:start position:0%
probable cause determination the case
 
00:48:25.230 --> 00:48:25.240 align:start position:0%
took an average of 384 days following
 
00:48:27.430 --> 00:48:27.440 align:start position:0%
investigator assignment
 
00:48:29.069 --> 00:48:29.079 align:start position:0%
no cases went to public hearing during
 
00:48:31.030 --> 00:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
State fiscal year
 
00:48:34.030 --> 00:48:34.040 align:start position:0%
2023 we found 62 cases or approximately
 
00:48:36.510 --> 00:48:36.520 align:start position:0%
27% of the cases we reviewed took so
 
00:48:38.270 --> 00:48:38.280 align:start position:0%
long to close that the complaintants
 
00:48:39.829 --> 00:48:39.839 align:start position:0%
could no longer remove the case to
 
00:48:42.230 --> 00:48:42.240 align:start position:0%
Superior Court within three-year statute
 
00:48:43.750 --> 00:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
of limitations
 
00:48:45.990 --> 00:48:46.000 align:start position:0%
deadline we recommended the commission
 
00:48:48.230 --> 00:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
ensure cases are processed timely by
 
00:48:51.470 --> 00:48:51.480 align:start position:0%
tracking dates of important case events
 
00:48:53.910 --> 00:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
for such for each case develop
 
00:48:55.430 --> 00:48:55.440 align:start position:0%
administrative rules to establish
 
00:48:57.710 --> 00:48:57.720 align:start position:0%
deadlines for amendments and extensions
 
00:48:59.510 --> 00:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
and evaluate the costs and benefits of
 
00:49:01.630 --> 00:49:01.640 align:start position:0%
different methods of tracking cases
 
00:49:05.750 --> 00:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:07.990 --> 00:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
system that was a very high level
 
00:49:09.990 --> 00:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
overview of our findings I mentioned
 
00:49:11.829 --> 00:49:11.839 align:start position:0%
earlier that the report includes 25
 
00:49:13.309 --> 00:49:13.319 align:start position:0%
findings with
 
00:49:15.069 --> 00:49:15.079 align:start position:0%
recommendations uh for improving
 
00:49:18.349 --> 00:49:18.359 align:start position:0%
management controls investigations and
 
00:49:20.470 --> 00:49:20.480 align:start position:0%
compliance corrective actions will take
 
00:49:22.390 --> 00:49:22.400 align:start position:0%
time to implement especially while the
 
00:49:24.230 --> 00:49:24.240 align:start position:0%
commission continues to conduct
 
00:49:27.710 --> 00:49:27.720 align:start position:0%
investigations and has uh position
 
00:49:29.230 --> 00:49:29.240 align:start position:0%
that remain
 
00:49:31.829 --> 00:49:31.839 align:start position:0%
unfilled the the appendices are found in
 
00:49:33.630 --> 00:49:33.640 align:start position:0%
tab sections of the report and include
 
00:49:35.750 --> 00:49:35.760 align:start position:0%

have been decades long this is not a
 
00:50:39.870 --> 00:50:39.880 align:start position:0%
recent phenomenon by any means um we
 
00:50:41.589 --> 00:50:41.599 align:start position:0%
really look forward to implementing
 
00:50:41.599 --> 00:50:42.349 align:start position:0%
really look forward to implementing
these

00:50:42.349 --> 00:50:42.359 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:50:44.910 --> 00:50:44.920 align:start position:0%

00:50:46.829 --> 00:50:46.839 align:start position:0%
transparency and
 
00:50:49.750 --> 00:50:49.760 align:start position:0%
efficiency um I do believe um I know I'm
 
00:50:51.710 --> 00:50:51.720 align:start position:0%
a temporary acting assistant director
 
00:50:54.549 --> 00:50:54.559 align:start position:0%
but I am very confident um that with
 
00:50:56.990 --> 00:50:57.000 align:start position:0%
these recommendations and the additional
 
00:50:59.069 --> 00:50:59.079 align:start position:0%
resources that we were allocated over
 
00:51:01.589 --> 00:51:01.599 align:start position:0%
this past budget cycle um that we are
 
00:51:04.789 --> 00:51:04.799 align:start position:0%
going to be able to better manage um the
 
00:51:08.430 --> 00:51:08.440 align:start position:0%
existing backlog and go forward um so I
 
00:51:10.109 --> 00:51:10.119 align:start position:0%
really again wanted to thank Mr clinch
 
00:51:12.069 --> 00:51:12.079 align:start position:0%

00:51:12.079 --> 00:51:13.030 align:start position:0%

gray uh certainly if note in appendix
 
00:51:26.950 --> 00:51:26.960 align:start position:0%
D um there's one two three four five six
 
00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:29.050 align:start position:0%

six 7 8
[Music]

00:51:32.470 --> 00:51:32.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:51:38.309 --> 00:51:38.319 align:start position:0%
n findings that go all the way back to
 
00:51:42.589 --> 00:51:42.599 align:start position:0%
2019 um and then there's two that are
 
00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:46.480 align:start position:0%
predate that by over 10 years and so
 
00:51:49.589 --> 00:51:49.599 align:start position:0%
what is the commitment to resolve those
 
00:51:52.549 --> 00:51:52.559 align:start position:0%
issues get your rules issued
 
00:51:55.589 --> 00:51:55.599 align:start position:0%
Etc yeah so unfortunately I was not in a
 
00:51:57.910 --> 00:51:57.920 align:start position:0%
position of man this is again I've
 
00:51:59.670 --> 00:51:59.680 align:start position:0%
acting assistant director it's very
 
00:52:02.710 --> 00:52:02.720 align:start position:0%
temporary very recent um so I cannot
 
00:52:05.549 --> 00:52:05.559 align:start position:0%
attest to that in my position is where
 
00:52:07.150 --> 00:52:07.160 align:start position:0%
I'm at right now with the Commissioners
 
00:52:08.870 --> 00:52:08.880 align:start position:0%
I know that we are all committed to
 
00:52:12.230 --> 00:52:12.240 align:start position:0%
moving forward um our priority right now
 
00:52:14.069 --> 00:52:14.079 align:start position:0%
especially is those administrative rules
 
00:52:15.829 --> 00:52:15.839 align:start position:0%
and that's from my perspective I don't
 
00:52:17.789 --> 00:52:17.799 align:start position:0%
know Sean wanted to add
 
00:52:19.789 --> 00:52:19.799 align:start position:0%
anything I would agree with that that's
 
00:52:23.710 --> 00:52:23.720 align:start position:0%
been a priority for the past um several
 
00:52:24.910 --> 00:52:24.920 align:start position:0%
years there was a person there was a
 
00:52:26.750 --> 00:52:26.760 align:start position:0%
staff person tasked with updating and
 
00:52:28.789 --> 00:52:28.799 align:start position:0%
revising the rules they Departed the
 
00:52:31.069 --> 00:52:31.079 align:start position:0%
commission um as that process was going
 
00:52:32.510 --> 00:52:32.520 align:start position:0%
forward but we are working the
 
00:52:34.270 --> 00:52:34.280 align:start position:0%
commission's working with OS and jail
 
00:52:35.470 --> 00:52:35.480 align:start position:0%
and getting ready for rules to be
 
00:52:38.109 --> 00:52:38.119 align:start position:0%
presented to jail car um to put rules in
 
00:52:39.470 --> 00:52:39.480 align:start position:0%
place and then there'll be follow-up
 
00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
amendments as kind of noted in the
 
00:52:43.190 --> 00:52:43.200 align:start position:0%
commission's responses to address some
 
00:52:46.190 --> 00:52:46.200 align:start position:0%
of the recommendations from the audit as
 
00:52:49.990 --> 00:52:50.000 align:start position:0%
well followup I will want someone to
 
00:52:53.309 --> 00:52:53.319 align:start position:0%
contact my office on a a good answer to
 
00:52:58.309 --> 00:52:58.319 align:start position:0%
this question so please have that happen
 
00:53:01.870 --> 00:53:01.880 align:start position:0%
absolutely Senator birdell did you have
 
00:53:04.190 --> 00:53:04.200 align:start position:0%
questions okay Senator Lehman and then
 
00:53:06.750 --> 00:53:06.760 align:start position:0%
Senator Waters a representative Lehman
 
00:53:08.270 --> 00:53:08.280 align:start position:0%
and then Senator Waters thanks for the
 
00:53:10.990 --> 00:53:11.000 align:start position:0%
promotion Mr chairman
 
00:53:14.069 --> 00:53:14.079 align:start position:0%
um so I don't know where to begin I feel
 
00:53:16.710 --> 00:53:16.720 align:start position:0%
sympathetic to the acting director but I
 
00:53:18.349 --> 00:53:18.359 align:start position:0%
read one of the comments from one of the
 
00:53:22.190 --> 00:53:22.200 align:start position:0%
attorneys back in section what C5 that
 
00:53:24.430 --> 00:53:24.440 align:start position:0%
it's been going on for 20 years that the
 
00:53:26.750 --> 00:53:26.760 align:start position:0%
service has been terrible I I think he
 
00:53:29.789 --> 00:53:29.799 align:start position:0%
used the word terrible or she doesn't
 
00:53:32.430 --> 00:53:32.440 align:start position:0%
um and I guess it begs the question
 
00:53:35.870 --> 00:53:35.880 align:start position:0%
because this has been a historic problem
 
00:53:38.150 --> 00:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
uh and your agency is asking for at
 
00:53:40.510 --> 00:53:40.520 align:start position:0%
least $3 million in general funds in
 
00:53:42.829 --> 00:53:42.839 align:start position:0%
this coming session does it make sense
 
00:53:45.870 --> 00:53:45.880 align:start position:0%
to continue because again things need to
 
00:53:49.349 --> 00:53:49.359 align:start position:0%
move forward uh it takes times for rules
 
00:53:51.309 --> 00:53:51.319 align:start position:0%
you've got a backlog I think was like
 
00:53:54.829 --> 00:53:54.839 align:start position:0%
259 cases I'm I'm just concerned that
 
00:53:56.430 --> 00:53:56.440 align:start position:0%
the request has been made for addition
 
00:53:59.309 --> 00:53:59.319 align:start position:0%
additional funding yet apparently this
 
00:54:01.990 --> 00:54:02.000 align:start position:0%
issue uh of cases being handled in a
 
00:54:04.190 --> 00:54:04.200 align:start position:0%
timely manner and number of other things
 
00:54:06.870 --> 00:54:06.880 align:start position:0%
that the audit folks found has been long
 
00:54:09.470 --> 00:54:09.480 align:start position:0%
term I just curious of your response or
 
00:54:11.710 --> 00:54:11.720 align:start position:0%
maybe a a better question for the
 
00:54:14.750 --> 00:54:14.760 align:start position:0%
gentleman from the Attorney General's
 
00:54:18.710 --> 00:54:18.720 align:start position:0%
office so I can speak again briefly um I
 
00:54:21.349 --> 00:54:21.359 align:start position:0%
can't speak for what has happened in the
 
00:54:23.230 --> 00:54:23.240 align:start position:0%
past I have been an employee there for
 
00:54:24.990 --> 00:54:25.000 align:start position:0%
11 and a half years but I've never been
 
00:54:27.670 --> 00:54:27.680 align:start position:0%
in management um um when I started our
 
00:54:30.910 --> 00:54:30.920 align:start position:0%
backlog was about 175 cases so again
 
00:54:34.549 --> 00:54:34.559 align:start position:0%
this is a long-existing issue I have no
 
00:54:36.190 --> 00:54:36.200 align:start position:0%
information right now in regards to the
 
00:54:38.390 --> 00:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
budget I was not the one who put that
 
00:54:41.190 --> 00:54:41.200 align:start position:0%
together um so I am going to be working
 
00:54:44.309 --> 00:54:44.319 align:start position:0%
with the doj in their business office um
 
00:54:46.069 --> 00:54:46.079 align:start position:0%
to answer those questions better in the
 
00:54:49.510 --> 00:54:49.520 align:start position:0%
next week or so I would just add here to
 
00:54:51.470 --> 00:54:51.480 align:start position:0%
that is you know one working with our
 
00:54:52.630 --> 00:54:52.640 align:start position:0%
business office because the agency is
 
00:54:54.190 --> 00:54:54.200 align:start position:0%
administratively attached to the
 
00:54:57.190 --> 00:54:57.200 align:start position:0%
department um but also you know some of
 
00:54:59.589 --> 00:54:59.599 align:start position:0%
this you know shortly after before
 
00:55:01.829 --> 00:55:01.839 align:start position:0%
Katrina had started with the commission
 
00:55:03.870 --> 00:55:03.880 align:start position:0%
the agency had had this would go back to
 
00:55:07.510 --> 00:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
about 2012 its Staffing cut by a third
 
00:55:09.349 --> 00:55:09.359 align:start position:0%
and it remained in that status despite
 
00:55:11.109 --> 00:55:11.119 align:start position:0%
requesting additional resources for
 
00:55:13.910 --> 00:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
almost a decade it wasn't until about
 
00:55:16.030 --> 00:55:16.040 align:start position:0%
2020 that they received additional
 
00:55:18.589 --> 00:55:18.599 align:start position:0%
resources and during that time that's
 
00:55:20.270 --> 00:55:20.280 align:start position:0%
when we see addition with staff turnover
 
00:55:21.870 --> 00:55:21.880 align:start position:0%
if you have Three Investigators and one
 
00:55:24.190 --> 00:55:24.200 align:start position:0%
investigator leaves you've lost a third
 
00:55:25.990 --> 00:55:26.000 align:start position:0%
of your capacity to M to manage the
 
00:55:28.150 --> 00:55:28.160 align:start position:0%
cases that are coming in the cases that
 
00:55:29.710 --> 00:55:29.720 align:start position:0%
have been coming in haven't decreased
 
00:55:32.150 --> 00:55:32.160 align:start position:0%
over time I've looked at legislative
 
00:55:33.750 --> 00:55:33.760 align:start position:0%
histories in different context going
 
00:55:36.390 --> 00:55:36.400 align:start position:0%
back to the 9s where comments were made
 
00:55:37.910 --> 00:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
you know about Staffing at the
 
00:55:39.829 --> 00:55:39.839 align:start position:0%
Commission in the backlog cases that
 
00:55:41.230 --> 00:55:41.240 align:start position:0%
hostile work environment claims
 
00:55:42.990 --> 00:55:43.000 align:start position:0%
disability discrimination claims these
 
00:55:44.510 --> 00:55:44.520 align:start position:0%
are new laws and they'd be temporary
 
00:55:46.670 --> 00:55:46.680 align:start position:0%
blips in the increase of cases the
 
00:55:48.549 --> 00:55:48.559 align:start position:0%
commission would receive that hasn't
 
00:55:51.109 --> 00:55:51.119 align:start position:0%
borne out over time they've remained
 
00:55:53.870 --> 00:55:53.880 align:start position:0%
significant sources of cases coming into
 
00:55:56.470 --> 00:55:56.480 align:start position:0%
the commission so it's it's an impact
 
00:55:59.309 --> 00:55:59.319 align:start position:0%
that is kind of cascaded from some
 
00:56:00.589 --> 00:56:00.599 align:start position:0%
requests the commit the efforts the
 
00:56:02.670 --> 00:56:02.680 align:start position:0%
commission has made to get its Staffing
 
00:56:04.430 --> 00:56:04.440 align:start position:0%
built up so it can manage the case load
 
00:56:07.029 --> 00:56:07.039 align:start position:0%
in front of it that's happened recently
 
00:56:08.750 --> 00:56:08.760 align:start position:0%
and so that's why the commission is
 
00:56:10.950 --> 00:56:10.960 align:start position:0%
optimistic that with these rules and
 
00:56:12.430 --> 00:56:12.440 align:start position:0%
these amendments and some of these
 
00:56:14.309 --> 00:56:14.319 align:start position:0%
proposals and recommendations were
 
00:56:16.109 --> 00:56:16.119 align:start position:0%
collaborations between the LBA Auditors
 
00:56:18.309 --> 00:56:18.319 align:start position:0%
and the commission and recommending time
 
00:56:19.910 --> 00:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
limits firm time limits that can be
 
00:56:22.150 --> 00:56:22.160 align:start position:0%
incorporated into the rules limitations
 
00:56:24.630 --> 00:56:24.640 align:start position:0%
on amendments to cases because we looked
 
00:56:26.910 --> 00:56:26.920 align:start position:0%
through the commission
 
00:56:28.390 --> 00:56:28.400 align:start position:0%
cases that had been pending for an
 
00:56:30.190 --> 00:56:30.200 align:start position:0%
extended period of time and found you
 
00:56:31.589 --> 00:56:31.599 align:start position:0%
know there'd be a case that was ready to
 
00:56:33.390 --> 00:56:33.400 align:start position:0%
go to a probable cause or no probable
 
00:56:35.510 --> 00:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
cause determination and the complainant
 
00:56:37.670 --> 00:56:37.680 align:start position:0%
would amend the charge to add a
 
00:56:39.750 --> 00:56:39.760 align:start position:0%
retaliation claim that charge now has to
 
00:56:41.670 --> 00:56:41.680 align:start position:0%
be investigated one of the
 
00:56:43.150 --> 00:56:43.160 align:start position:0%
recommendations would be that there's a
 
00:56:46.829 --> 00:56:46.839 align:start position:0%
limit on when that can occur when an
 
00:56:48.230 --> 00:56:48.240 align:start position:0%
amendment can be made as a matter of
 
00:56:49.549 --> 00:56:49.559 align:start position:0%
right or when a person would have to
 
00:56:51.789 --> 00:56:51.799 align:start position:0%
file a new charge of discrimination
 
00:56:53.390 --> 00:56:53.400 align:start position:0%
instead of amending and starting the
 
00:56:55.349 --> 00:56:55.359 align:start position:0%
process over which extends the time that
 
00:56:57.710 --> 00:56:57.720 align:start position:0%
it takes for a case to process other
 
00:56:59.510 --> 00:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
examples of issues that have Arisen that
 
00:57:01.109 --> 00:57:01.119 align:start position:0%
have kind of caused some cases to
 
00:57:03.549 --> 00:57:03.559 align:start position:0%
languish longer than others parties
 
00:57:05.549 --> 00:57:05.559 align:start position:0%
asking for additional time it's a
 
00:57:07.510 --> 00:57:07.520 align:start position:0%
recurring issue it was a recurring issue
 
00:57:09.829 --> 00:57:09.839 align:start position:0%
where I'm going on vacation I'm going to
 
00:57:10.990 --> 00:57:11.000 align:start position:0%
be out of the office I need an
 
00:57:12.470 --> 00:57:12.480 align:start position:0%
additional month to do something two
 
00:57:14.789 --> 00:57:14.799 align:start position:0%
months to do something those add up over
 
00:57:16.789 --> 00:57:16.799 align:start position:0%
time and that leads to again or
 
00:57:18.630 --> 00:57:18.640 align:start position:0%
attorney's Changing Hands the the
 
00:57:19.870 --> 00:57:19.880 align:start position:0%
business that's
 
00:57:22.910 --> 00:57:22.920 align:start position:0%
being investigated is you know their
 
00:57:24.230 --> 00:57:24.240 align:start position:0%
attorney leaves they get a new attorney
 
00:57:25.950 --> 00:57:25.960 align:start position:0%
I need six months to get up to speed on
 
00:57:28.510 --> 00:57:28.520 align:start position:0%
this it leads to those increases in time
 
00:57:31.510 --> 00:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
so it's not necessarily solely something
 
00:57:32.829 --> 00:57:32.839 align:start position:0%
within the commission's control it's
 
00:57:34.870 --> 00:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
also the parties appearing before but
 
00:57:36.870 --> 00:57:36.880 align:start position:0%
rules and more transparent rules about
 
00:57:39.309 --> 00:57:39.319 align:start position:0%
those processes would help facilitate
 
00:57:42.510 --> 00:57:42.520 align:start position:0%
and kind of prevent some of that maybe
 
00:57:44.390 --> 00:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
for lack of at word abuse of kind of
 
00:57:45.870 --> 00:57:45.880 align:start position:0%
their procedures that have existed in
 
00:57:49.910 --> 00:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
the past further question Mr chairman
 
00:57:52.910 --> 00:57:52.920 align:start position:0%
further thank you I guess I'm concerned
 
00:57:54.710 --> 00:57:54.720 align:start position:0%
because I said as the division chair
 
00:57:57.309 --> 00:57:57.319 align:start position:0%
that received the request last session
 
00:58:00.029 --> 00:58:00.039 align:start position:0%
for additional help we were told that I
 
00:58:02.750 --> 00:58:02.760 align:start position:0%
think if we had four more investigators
 
00:58:06.349 --> 00:58:06.359 align:start position:0%
added that uh there'd be a tick down if
 
00:58:10.390 --> 00:58:10.400 align:start position:0%
you will a number of cases uh we answer
 
00:58:12.750 --> 00:58:12.760 align:start position:0%
the requests not many people received
 
00:58:15.870 --> 00:58:15.880 align:start position:0%
additional staff in the last budget uh
 
00:58:17.950 --> 00:58:17.960 align:start position:0%
we provided that and yet again the case
 
00:58:19.470 --> 00:58:19.480 align:start position:0%
loads have gone up I understand maybe
 
00:58:21.630 --> 00:58:21.640 align:start position:0%
you haven't been able to fill but it's
 
00:58:24.029 --> 00:58:24.039 align:start position:0%
still very concerning to me and I'm sure
 
00:58:25.390 --> 00:58:25.400 align:start position:0%
the rest of the members up here that
 
00:58:27.349 --> 00:58:27.359 align:start position:0%
when people go V to the Human Rights
 
00:58:30.109 --> 00:58:30.119 align:start position:0%
Commission it takes years to get a
 
00:58:33.109 --> 00:58:33.119 align:start position:0%
response or a decision and we're just
 
00:58:34.990 --> 00:58:35.000 align:start position:0%
not meeting the needs of the people of
 
00:58:37.990 --> 00:58:38.000 align:start position:0%
our state and again my concern about
 
00:58:40.069 --> 00:58:40.079 align:start position:0%
again the amount of money that's been
 
00:58:42.710 --> 00:58:42.720 align:start position:0%
spent and we seem to be going backwards
 
00:58:44.510 --> 00:58:44.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thanks for taking
 
00:58:46.029 --> 00:58:46.039 align:start position:0%
my question Senator Waters and then
 
00:58:46.039 --> 00:58:47.069 align:start position:0%
my question Senator Waters and then
Senator

00:58:47.069 --> 00:58:47.079 align:start position:0%
Senator
 
00:58:49.589 --> 00:58:49.599 align:start position:0%
Carson thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:58:51.910 --> 00:58:51.920 align:start position:0%
you all and and you know assistant
 
00:58:53.390 --> 00:58:53.400 align:start position:0%
acting assistant director I appreciate
 
00:58:56.470 --> 00:58:56.480 align:start position:0%
your situation um so I guess Mr chairman
 
00:58:59.390 --> 00:58:59.400 align:start position:0%
what I would wonder is that um if we
 
00:59:01.309 --> 00:59:01.319 align:start position:0%
could have some follow-up information
 
00:59:05.390 --> 00:59:05.400 align:start position:0%
onto an exact a precise schedule for the
 
00:59:07.390 --> 00:59:07.400 align:start position:0%
um preparation and submission to rules
 
00:59:08.630 --> 00:59:08.640 align:start position:0%
to jail
 
00:59:12.190 --> 00:59:12.200 align:start position:0%
car that that I think we need to know
 
00:59:13.910 --> 00:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
it's rather vague in here we need I
 
00:59:15.230 --> 00:59:15.240 align:start position:0%
think we need to know how you're going
 
00:59:17.710 --> 00:59:17.720 align:start position:0%
to accomplish that um secondly I think
 
00:59:19.549 --> 00:59:19.559 align:start position:0%
this will probably come out through
 
00:59:21.710 --> 00:59:21.720 align:start position:0%
house finance but it would be good to
 
00:59:25.589 --> 00:59:25.599 align:start position:0%
know how the money has been applied um
 
00:59:27.349 --> 00:59:27.359 align:start position:0%
from the that increased from the last
 
00:59:29.870 --> 00:59:29.880 align:start position:0%
budget just you know H what has resulted
 
00:59:31.710 --> 00:59:31.720 align:start position:0%
and who is hired and how have the duties
 
00:59:33.390 --> 00:59:33.400 align:start position:0%
been maybe been separated out as they
 
00:59:35.230 --> 00:59:35.240 align:start position:0%
should be between the people working on
 
00:59:38.390 --> 00:59:38.400 align:start position:0%
cases and the administrative tasks um
 
00:59:41.549 --> 00:59:41.559 align:start position:0%
but thirdly uh Mr chairman I I think on
 
00:59:44.069 --> 00:59:44.079 align:start position:0%
this one we we need to have a mechanism
 
00:59:46.750 --> 00:59:46.760 align:start position:0%
here in this committee to follow up and
 
00:59:48.150 --> 00:59:48.160 align:start position:0%
I don't know what schedule you'd want to
 
00:59:49.670 --> 00:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
put whether it be you know once a month
 
00:59:51.829 --> 00:59:51.839 align:start position:0%
or every couple months that they come in
 
00:59:54.630 --> 00:59:54.640 align:start position:0%
we have to work through this um because
 
00:59:57.950 --> 00:59:57.960 align:start position:0%
it I I do not I'm not con I'm not
 
01:00:00.630 --> 01:00:00.640 align:start position:0%
confident there's the capacity for the
 
01:00:05.150 --> 01:00:05.160 align:start position:0%
commission to um implement the
 
01:00:07.549 --> 01:00:07.559 align:start position:0%
recommendations and if and I I think
 
01:00:08.710 --> 01:00:08.720 align:start position:0%
that's why we're just going to have to
 
01:00:10.510 --> 01:00:10.520 align:start position:0%
monitor because this situation can't
 
01:00:13.069 --> 01:00:13.079 align:start position:0%
continue thank you Mr
 
01:00:16.670 --> 01:00:16.680 align:start position:0%
chairman Senator Carson thank you excuse
 
01:00:19.510 --> 01:00:19.520 align:start position:0%
me thank you Mr chairman uh my question
 
01:00:23.109 --> 01:00:23.119 align:start position:0%
is for turnning lock um in going through
 
01:00:24.990 --> 01:00:25.000 align:start position:0%
these it seems like part of the problem
 
01:00:27.710 --> 01:00:27.720 align:start position:0%
are is the large number of prosay
 
01:00:30.190 --> 01:00:30.200 align:start position:0%
litigants they they're really ignorant
 
01:00:32.230 --> 01:00:32.240 align:start position:0%
of the legal process and they don't
 
01:00:33.950 --> 01:00:33.960 align:start position:0%
understand everything that's going
 
01:00:35.990 --> 01:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
through and I think back to what the
 
01:00:38.950 --> 01:00:38.960 align:start position:0%
legislature did a few years ago by
 
01:00:41.430 --> 01:00:41.440 align:start position:0%
allowing paral legals to work under the
 
01:00:43.349 --> 01:00:43.359 align:start position:0%
direction of an attorney to work with
 
01:00:46.270 --> 01:00:46.280 align:start position:0%
prosade litigant in Family Court do you
 
01:00:48.349 --> 01:00:48.359 align:start position:0%
think that that is something that would
 
01:00:50.829 --> 01:00:50.839 align:start position:0%
help this process going
 
01:00:53.309 --> 01:00:53.319 align:start position:0%
forward I think representation could
 
01:00:56.470 --> 01:00:56.480 align:start position:0%
help in those capacities um would still
 
01:00:58.390 --> 01:00:58.400 align:start position:0%
come down to are those people able to
 
01:01:00.150 --> 01:01:00.160 align:start position:0%
even find paralal services to assist
 
01:01:02.510 --> 01:01:02.520 align:start position:0%
them but um it could help because it
 
01:01:04.029 --> 01:01:04.039 align:start position:0%
helps it would help with kind of keeping
 
01:01:06.029 --> 01:01:06.039 align:start position:0%
the cases more organized I think some of
 
01:01:07.630 --> 01:01:07.640 align:start position:0%
the challenges with self-represented
 
01:01:09.589 --> 01:01:09.599 align:start position:0%
individuals is that tracking them down
 
01:01:11.309 --> 01:01:11.319 align:start position:0%
being in contact with them getting the
 
01:01:13.589 --> 01:01:13.599 align:start position:0%
records you need and I think uh
 
01:01:15.270 --> 01:01:15.280 align:start position:0%
Katrina's even better poised to answer
 
01:01:17.789 --> 01:01:17.799 align:start position:0%
that question speak to that than I am um
 
01:01:20.230 --> 01:01:20.240 align:start position:0%
it it does create significant challenges
 
01:01:22.750 --> 01:01:22.760 align:start position:0%
um and and it can again lead to delays
 
01:01:25.549 --> 01:01:25.559 align:start position:0%
because there might not be the the rapid
 
01:01:27.430 --> 01:01:27.440 align:start position:0%
response some people are in difficult
 
01:01:29.589 --> 01:01:29.599 align:start position:0%
situations if they've lost employment
 
01:01:30.670 --> 01:01:30.680 align:start position:0%
they're looking for new employment
 
01:01:32.069 --> 01:01:32.079 align:start position:0%
they're not as concerned with responding
 
01:01:34.349 --> 01:01:34.359 align:start position:0%
to a request from the commission so and
 
01:01:36.829 --> 01:01:36.839 align:start position:0%
I'll let uh Kina speak to that even more
 
01:01:39.430 --> 01:01:39.440 align:start position:0%
okay yeah um I think and again it's
 
01:01:41.190 --> 01:01:41.200 align:start position:0%
really for me it goes down to the volume
 
01:01:44.750 --> 01:01:44.760 align:start position:0%
of complaints um we get at least 25
 
01:01:47.430 --> 01:01:47.440 align:start position:0%
complaints per month um and so the
 
01:01:50.150 --> 01:01:50.160 align:start position:0%
consistence volume I don't for me I'm
 
01:01:51.910 --> 01:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
not sure I do think it would help those
 
01:01:54.750 --> 01:01:54.760 align:start position:0%
folks absolutely um but for me I don't
 
01:01:56.510 --> 01:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
know if it would decrease the number of
 
01:01:59.789 --> 01:01:59.799 align:start position:0%
filings that we see um every
 
01:02:01.870 --> 01:02:01.880 align:start position:0%
year thank
 
01:02:04.349 --> 01:02:04.359 align:start position:0%
you further questions from the committee
 
01:02:04.359 --> 01:02:05.950 align:start position:0%
you further questions from the committee
Senator

01:02:05.950 --> 01:02:05.960 align:start position:0%
Senator
 
01:02:09.829 --> 01:02:09.839 align:start position:0%
gray um the recommendation was made that
 
01:02:13.150 --> 01:02:13.160 align:start position:0%
there may be um need for legislative
 
01:02:17.269 --> 01:02:17.279 align:start position:0%
action on 10 and
 
01:02:20.269 --> 01:02:20.279 align:start position:0%
13 I would like some more information
 
01:02:20.279 --> 01:02:21.349 align:start position:0%
13 I would like some more information
about

01:02:21.349 --> 01:02:21.359 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:02:24.789 --> 01:02:24.799 align:start position:0%
what you believe that legislative action
 
01:02:26.549 --> 01:02:26.559 align:start position:0%
could be
 
01:02:30.309 --> 01:02:30.319 align:start position:0%
uh the Senate has a lot more leeway in
 
01:02:33.510 --> 01:02:33.520 align:start position:0%
adding things to bills that they
 
01:02:38.589 --> 01:02:38.599 align:start position:0%
have uh so picking a senator to uh at
 
01:02:40.630 --> 01:02:40.640 align:start position:0%
least have that discussion with whether
 
01:02:42.309 --> 01:02:42.319 align:start position:0%
it's me or someone
 
01:02:46.510 --> 01:02:46.520 align:start position:0%
else uh would be to to me it may help
 
01:02:49.630 --> 01:02:49.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:51.990 --> 01:02:52.000 align:start position:0%
along I can speak from a statutory
 
01:02:54.309 --> 01:02:54.319 align:start position:0%
standpoint looking at recommendation 10
 
01:02:55.470 --> 01:02:55.480 align:start position:0%
um what it boils down to is some
 
01:02:57.069 --> 01:02:57.079 align:start position:0%
additional language that could be added
 
01:02:59.630 --> 01:02:59.640 align:start position:0%
to the statute to make it very clear
 
01:03:01.829 --> 01:03:01.839 align:start position:0%
that um the Commissioners can rely on
 
01:03:03.910 --> 01:03:03.920 align:start position:0%
staff to facilitate the conciliation
 
01:03:06.390 --> 01:03:06.400 align:start position:0%
process so it's pretty straightforward I
 
01:03:08.349 --> 01:03:08.359 align:start position:0%
think recommendation 13 you'll see in
 
01:03:10.309 --> 01:03:10.319 align:start position:0%
why it's a concurrent part is that the
 
01:03:11.789 --> 01:03:11.799 align:start position:0%
commission doesn't necessarily agree
 
01:03:13.990 --> 01:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
that statutory changes are necessary
 
01:03:16.589 --> 01:03:16.599 align:start position:0%
although the LBA
 
01:03:19.670 --> 01:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
does well we can't attempt to do it
 
01:03:22.710 --> 01:03:22.720 align:start position:0%
until you get either myself or one of
 
01:03:26.150 --> 01:03:26.160 align:start position:0%
the other Senators that language okay
 
01:03:27.910 --> 01:03:27.920 align:start position:0%
and it should be on 10 and it should be
 
01:03:32.029 --> 01:03:32.039 align:start position:0%
on 13 and if we have a bill that
 
01:03:35.990 --> 01:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
is close or deals with that same statute
 
01:03:39.549 --> 01:03:39.559 align:start position:0%
or whether we hold a public hearing you
 
01:03:41.269 --> 01:03:41.279 align:start position:0%
know we might be able to help you if you
 
01:03:44.549 --> 01:03:44.559 align:start position:0%
come see us thank you Senator
 
01:03:48.750 --> 01:03:48.760 align:start position:0%
gr uh I value very much the audits that
 
01:03:51.309 --> 01:03:51.319 align:start position:0%
come from the audit division and where
 
01:03:53.190 --> 01:03:53.200 align:start position:0%
they since we are the first legislative
 
01:03:56.510 --> 01:03:56.520 align:start position:0%
group to see them when they suggest
 
01:03:59.510 --> 01:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
that legislative fixes are involved I
 
01:04:01.990 --> 01:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
will file that legislation we have the
 
01:04:04.470 --> 01:04:04.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity to put it in hb2 but I need
 
01:04:07.829 --> 01:04:07.839 align:start position:0%
to get the suggestion within three weeks
 
01:04:09.870 --> 01:04:09.880 align:start position:0%
sure thank you so much we' also be
 
01:04:12.150 --> 01:04:12.160 align:start position:0%
anxious to learn by the next meeting
 
01:04:16.390 --> 01:04:16.400 align:start position:0%
your progress on the uh the adoption of
 
01:04:18.710 --> 01:04:18.720 align:start position:0%
your rules sure so we'd like to see
 
01:04:22.190 --> 01:04:22.200 align:start position:0%
those either by next meeting or the one
 
01:04:24.470 --> 01:04:24.480 align:start position:0%
succeeding if you're not finished by
 
01:04:27.589 --> 01:04:27.599 align:start position:0%
then but I always take the uh
 
01:04:29.910 --> 01:04:29.920 align:start position:0%
appreciation of the of the work done by
 
01:04:31.589 --> 01:04:31.599 align:start position:0%
audit division and I always file the
 
01:04:34.150 --> 01:04:34.160 align:start position:0%
legislation when I see any that's needed
 
01:04:37.109 --> 01:04:37.119 align:start position:0%
so we need to get that input from you
 
01:04:40.029 --> 01:04:40.039 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we have a an opportunity
 
01:04:42.829 --> 01:04:42.839 align:start position:0%
to put it in hb2 so sure we'll look
 
01:04:44.390 --> 01:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
forward to getting those
 
01:04:47.430 --> 01:04:47.440 align:start position:0%
soon further from the committee uh
 
01:04:50.470 --> 01:04:50.480 align:start position:0%
representative walner I just wanted to
 
01:04:53.349 --> 01:04:53.359 align:start position:0%
uh make a statement that the house
 
01:04:55.309 --> 01:04:55.319 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee should probably be
 
01:04:55.319 --> 01:04:56.870 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee should probably be
involved

01:04:56.870 --> 01:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
involved
 
01:05:01.029 --> 01:05:01.039 align:start position:0%
in um in looking at this audit and
 
01:05:03.109 --> 01:05:03.119 align:start position:0%
monitoring it we will make sure that
 
01:05:08.029 --> 01:05:08.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:10.069 --> 01:05:10.079 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
01:05:14.670 --> 01:05:14.680 align:start position:0%
Griffin thank you I ju I just uh I'm
 
01:05:18.630 --> 01:05:18.640 align:start position:0%
really concerned that a uh person who
 
01:05:22.150 --> 01:05:22.160 align:start position:0%
petitions the board is going to be
 
01:05:25.029 --> 01:05:25.039 align:start position:0%
really depressed about the amount of
 
01:05:29.630 --> 01:05:29.640 align:start position:0%
time at takes to react to the
 
01:05:33.390 --> 01:05:33.400 align:start position:0%
petition and uh it seems to me that the
 
01:05:36.910 --> 01:05:36.920 align:start position:0%
old adage that Justice delayed is
 
01:05:41.510 --> 01:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
Justice denied really comes into play
 
01:05:43.390 --> 01:05:43.400 align:start position:0%
when the time
 
01:05:47.789 --> 01:05:47.799 align:start position:0%
period uh from the initial filing to the
 
01:05:50.069 --> 01:05:50.079 align:start position:0%
case being determined and
 
01:05:54.349 --> 01:05:54.359 align:start position:0%
closed is as long as it is and it's got
 
01:05:56.269 --> 01:05:56.279 align:start position:0%
to be discouraging
 
01:06:01.430 --> 01:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
to a uh petitioner who goes there I know
 
01:06:04.549 --> 01:06:04.559 align:start position:0%
from my own experience I've had
 
01:06:09.230 --> 01:06:09.240 align:start position:0%
constituents call me up and complain
 
01:06:14.670 --> 01:06:14.680 align:start position:0%
about the time period and U somehow
 
01:06:16.870 --> 01:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
we've got to figure out how to shorten
 
01:06:19.549 --> 01:06:19.559 align:start position:0%
that period because
 
01:06:22.109 --> 01:06:22.119 align:start position:0%
otherwise the whole existence of the
 
01:06:27.789 --> 01:06:27.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:30.390 --> 01:06:30.400 align:start position:0%
further from the committee so our new
 
01:06:33.549 --> 01:06:33.559 align:start position:0%
procedure says that we have at the time
 
01:06:37.230 --> 01:06:37.240 align:start position:0%
that these are released the LBA releases
 
01:06:41.349 --> 01:06:41.359 align:start position:0%
it so the normal motion is to accept the
 
01:06:43.190 --> 01:06:43.200 align:start position:0%
report place it on file and release in
 
01:06:45.109 --> 01:06:45.119 align:start position:0%
the usual manner that has already been
 
01:06:45.119 --> 01:06:46.510 align:start position:0%
the usual manner that has already been
done

01:06:46.510 --> 01:06:46.520 align:start position:0%
done
 
01:06:49.630 --> 01:06:49.640 align:start position:0%
so that that has been accomplished so
 
01:06:51.549 --> 01:06:51.559 align:start position:0%
you've been instructed as to what we
 
01:06:56.109 --> 01:06:56.119 align:start position:0%
expect to get back uh pretty soon from
 
01:06:58.430 --> 01:06:58.440 align:start position:0%
this audit and appreciate the
 
01:07:00.789 --> 01:07:00.799 align:start position:0%
thoroughness of the audit division as
 
01:07:03.349 --> 01:07:03.359 align:start position:0%
usual anything else on this audit we
 
01:07:23.309 --> 01:07:23.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:27.630 --> 01:07:27.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:30.390 --> 01:07:30.400 align:start position:0%
okay they always do that put them in you
 
01:07:32.990 --> 01:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
can do it if you got more thorough way
 
01:07:34.430 --> 01:07:34.440 align:start position:0%
to do it that's
 
01:07:37.549 --> 01:07:37.559 align:start position:0%
fine I always fall love because nobody
 
01:07:37.559 --> 01:07:45.549 align:start position:0%
fine I always fall love because nobody
else

01:07:45.549 --> 01:07:45.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:49.829 --> 01:07:49.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:54.069 --> 01:07:54.079 align:start position:0%

presenting on behalf of our firm we have
 
01:08:59.030 --> 01:08:59.040 align:start position:0%

is just fine um those materials are for
 
01:09:08.309 --> 01:09:08.319 align:start position:0%
your reference there's one page that
 
01:09:10.470 --> 01:09:10.480 align:start position:0%
I'll speak to in a moment and that'll
 
01:09:13.669 --> 01:09:13.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:15.990 --> 01:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
comments so as I said the the fiscal
 
01:09:17.229 --> 01:09:17.239 align:start position:0%
year end of these structures are
 
01:09:20.390 --> 01:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
September 30th um in November of
 
01:09:23.309 --> 01:09:23.319 align:start position:0%
2024 uh we presented the state of New
 
01:09:25.470 --> 01:09:25.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the treasurer's office
 
01:09:27.630 --> 01:09:27.640 align:start position:0%
with our audit results and those audit
 
01:09:29.669 --> 01:09:29.679 align:start position:0%
results have been positive and then on
 
01:09:33.990 --> 01:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
December 12th and December 19th I issued
 
01:09:36.269 --> 01:09:36.279 align:start position:0%
clean unqualified opinions on the
 
01:09:39.269 --> 01:09:39.279 align:start position:0%
results of both of those structures so
 
01:09:40.990 --> 01:09:41.000 align:start position:0%
if I could direct your attention to page
 
01:09:43.430 --> 01:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
five that'll be a good page that we can
 
01:09:48.590 --> 01:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:51.030 --> 01:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
from the title of that page is the
 
01:09:52.829 --> 01:09:52.839 align:start position:0%
status of our
 
01:09:55.030 --> 01:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
Audits and I just wanted to focus on our
 
01:09:57.830 --> 01:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
discuss today so I did Issue unqualified
 
01:10:00.229 --> 01:10:00.239 align:start position:0%
opinions uh meaning clean opinions on
 
01:10:02.310 --> 01:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
the results uh for each of the
 
01:10:04.950 --> 01:10:04.960 align:start position:0%
structures and those were issued on
 
01:10:06.790 --> 01:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
again December 12th and December
 
01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:07.669 align:start position:0%
again December 12th and December
December

01:10:07.669 --> 01:10:07.679 align:start position:0%
December
 
01:10:10.709 --> 01:10:10.719 align:start position:0%
19th my team did not identify any
 
01:10:12.990 --> 01:10:13.000 align:start position:0%
controll deficiencies that Rose to the
 
01:10:14.430 --> 01:10:14.440 align:start position:0%
level of material weakness or
 
01:10:16.910 --> 01:10:16.920 align:start position:0%
significant deficiency so not just good
 
01:10:19.430 --> 01:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
audit results but also good impacts and
 
01:10:22.590 --> 01:10:22.600 align:start position:0%
good uh assessments on internal controls
 
01:10:24.510 --> 01:10:24.520 align:start position:0%
uh we received the full cooperation of
 
01:10:27.270 --> 01:10:27.280 align:start position:0%
all the service providers um that we
 
01:10:29.270 --> 01:10:29.280 align:start position:0%
came into contact with that includes the
 
01:10:30.870 --> 01:10:30.880 align:start position:0%
individuals at Fidelity and also the
 
01:10:32.630 --> 01:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
folks at the State of New
 
01:10:35.430 --> 01:10:35.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um similarily uh my team
 
01:10:37.790 --> 01:10:37.800 align:start position:0%
achieved every objective that we had set
 
01:10:40.630 --> 01:10:40.640 align:start position:0%
forth in our plan we had no restrictions
 
01:10:42.630 --> 01:10:42.640 align:start position:0%
on where we wanted to go on what we
 
01:10:45.790 --> 01:10:45.800 align:start position:0%
needed to see as it related to um some
 
01:10:49.870 --> 01:10:49.880 align:start position:0%
very specific audit objectives we um
 
01:10:52.910 --> 01:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
independently confirmed the existence of
 
01:10:55.790 --> 01:10:55.800 align:start position:0%
100% of the assets we
 
01:10:58.470 --> 01:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
uh repriced independently without error
 
01:11:01.870 --> 01:11:01.880 align:start position:0%
or uh without issue 100% of the items
 
01:11:04.550 --> 01:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
that were in for valuation and as it
 
01:11:07.390 --> 01:11:07.400 align:start position:0%
relates to the p&amp;l items income into the
 
01:11:09.630 --> 01:11:09.640 align:start position:0%
funds and expenses that went out of the
 
01:11:12.270 --> 01:11:12.280 align:start position:0%
funds uh we observed no material
 
01:11:14.229 --> 01:11:14.239 align:start position:0%
differences in any of our audit results
 
01:11:17.070 --> 01:11:17.080 align:start position:0%
so very very clean audit results uh as
 
01:11:19.510 --> 01:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
as is customary with these
 
01:11:21.750 --> 01:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
structures finally I'll just highlight
 
01:11:23.149 --> 01:11:23.159 align:start position:0%
as it relates to the state of New
 
01:11:24.470 --> 01:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire fees that go to the State of
 
01:11:27.870 --> 01:11:27.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um those uh those um
 
01:11:30.229 --> 01:11:30.239 align:start position:0%
results that I shared with you extend to
 
01:11:31.709 --> 01:11:31.719 align:start position:0%
the fees that are received by the state
 
01:11:34.189 --> 01:11:34.199 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire we had no differences
 
01:11:36.350 --> 01:11:36.360 align:start position:0%
no audit differences noted in our
 
01:11:39.629 --> 01:11:39.639 align:start position:0%
independent recalculation of those fees
 
01:11:42.270 --> 01:11:42.280 align:start position:0%
okay so the remainder report is again
 
01:11:44.510 --> 01:11:44.520 align:start position:0%
for your reference unfortunately it's
 
01:11:46.590 --> 01:11:46.600 align:start position:0%
called required Communications and so
 
01:11:48.030 --> 01:11:48.040 align:start position:0%
it's very similar to what we've
 
01:11:50.430 --> 01:11:50.440 align:start position:0%
presented to you in the past but it it
 
01:11:53.910 --> 01:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
highlights and reaffirms for the group
 
01:11:55.950 --> 01:11:55.960 align:start position:0%
that uh our firm is is independent of
 
01:11:59.149 --> 01:11:59.159 align:start position:0%
the structures we identified no fraud
 
01:12:00.870 --> 01:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
all of the related party transactions
 
01:12:02.870 --> 01:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
that are required to be disclosed have
 
01:12:06.070 --> 01:12:06.080 align:start position:0%
been disclosed um and that um and that
 
01:12:07.270 --> 01:12:07.280 align:start position:0%
there were no disagreements with
 
01:12:09.390 --> 01:12:09.400 align:start position:0%
managements and again no issues errors
 
01:12:11.590 --> 01:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
unadjusted items or audit adjustments
 
01:12:12.950 --> 01:12:12.960 align:start position:0%
that were
 
01:12:14.950 --> 01:12:14.960 align:start position:0%
identified at this time I'm happy to
 
01:12:17.070 --> 01:12:17.080 align:start position:0%
answer any questions that anyone has on
 
01:12:18.189 --> 01:12:18.199 align:start position:0%
those audit
 
01:12:20.629 --> 01:12:20.639 align:start position:0%
results questions from the
 
01:12:23.790 --> 01:12:23.800 align:start position:0%
committee happy to say that some of us
 
01:12:27.270 --> 01:12:27.280 align:start position:0%
in present uh with the um guidance of
 
01:12:29.950 --> 01:12:29.960 align:start position:0%
our Madam Treasurer we look at all these
 
01:12:32.550 --> 01:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
accounts quarterly so we have a lot of
 
01:12:35.310 --> 01:12:35.320 align:start position:0%
familiarity with these and uh I know
 
01:12:37.110 --> 01:12:37.120 align:start position:0%
she's keeping track of every dollar as
 
01:12:40.270 --> 01:12:40.280 align:start position:0%
she always does so there any other
 
01:12:43.990 --> 01:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee so the
 
01:12:45.910 --> 01:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
motion has been made that the report be
 
01:12:47.629 --> 01:12:47.639 align:start position:0%
accepted placed on file and released in
 
01:12:51.990 --> 01:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
the usual Manner and that will be done
 
01:12:53.950 --> 01:12:53.960 align:start position:0%
if there's no other
 
01:12:55.990 --> 01:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
questions then and I guess the next
 
01:12:58.110 --> 01:12:58.120 align:start position:0%
thing is to pick a date thank you very
 
01:13:00.270 --> 01:13:00.280 align:start position:0%
much for your good work welcome to New
 
01:13:05.270 --> 01:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:07.390 align:start position:0%
 
kindly

01:13:07.390 --> 01:13:07.400 align:start position:0%
kindly
 
01:13:13.030 --> 01:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
so we'll discuss the usual third Friday
 
01:13:15.510 --> 01:13:15.520 align:start position:0%
third Friday would bring to um the 21st
 
01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:20.229 align:start position:0%
third Friday would bring to um the 21st
of

01:13:20.229 --> 01:13:20.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:22.669 --> 01:13:22.679 align:start position:0%
March so let's take a look at our
 
01:13:24.629 --> 01:13:24.639 align:start position:0%
schedules and see if anybody has any
 
01:13:26.149 --> 01:13:26.159 align:start position:0%
restriction or
 
01:13:26.159 --> 01:13:28.390 align:start position:0%
restriction or
any

01:13:28.390 --> 01:13:28.400 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:31.110 align:start position:0%
any
um

01:13:31.110 --> 01:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:34.790 --> 01:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
request for any particular starting time
 
01:13:36.790 --> 01:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
I have
 
01:13:40.310 --> 01:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
a senator gray I have a university
 
01:13:44.030 --> 01:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
system Board of Trustees meeting
 
01:13:47.470 --> 01:13:47.480 align:start position:0%
that uh usually it gets out around noon
 
01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:49.189 align:start position:0%
that uh usually it gets out around noon
time

01:13:49.189 --> 01:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:13:52.750 --> 01:13:52.760 align:start position:0%
so I wouldn't be available until the
 
01:13:55.669 --> 01:13:55.679 align:start position:0%
afternoon but that
 
01:13:58.110 --> 01:13:58.120 align:start position:0%
I'm not the only one any other conflicts
 
01:14:00.629 --> 01:14:00.639 align:start position:0%
with anybody on most of us aren't
 
01:14:03.470 --> 01:14:03.480 align:start position:0%
scheduled that far ahead Senator Carson
 
01:14:07.070 --> 01:14:07.080 align:start position:0%
I um I have the children's oversight
 
01:14:09.310 --> 01:14:09.320 align:start position:0%
Commission in the morning which usually
 
01:14:13.350 --> 01:14:13.360 align:start position:0%
can go between 10 and between 9 and 11
 
01:14:15.430 --> 01:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
and then in the afternoon I have the um
 
01:14:18.070 --> 01:14:18.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Ireland trade council at
 
01:14:21.629 --> 01:14:21.639 align:start position:0%
1:30 so up your day doesn't it yeah oh
 
01:14:26.070 --> 01:14:26.080 align:start position:0%
that's okay um so if I mean 11:00 worked
 
01:14:30.550 --> 01:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
well for me um because this doesn't seem
 
01:14:33.430 --> 01:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
I mean I know it can run long but
 
01:14:35.750 --> 01:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
um you think it might be able to be
 
01:14:37.550 --> 01:14:37.560 align:start position:0%
present for most of it if we had it at
 
01:14:40.590 --> 01:14:40.600 align:start position:0%
11: yeah I think so chairman
 
01:14:42.790 --> 01:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
Representatives any preference one way
 
01:14:46.990 --> 01:14:47.000 align:start position:0%
or the other all right let's schedule it
 
01:14:49.990 --> 01:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
Mr Kane yes so we're talking Friday the
 
01:14:53.270 --> 01:14:53.280 align:start position:0%
21st 11:00 for fiscal if we have a pre
 
01:14:56.070 --> 01:14:56.080 align:start position:0%
fiscal we'll probably do it at at 10:00
 
01:14:59.629 --> 01:14:59.639 align:start position:0%
for the members of the house
 
01:15:02.550 --> 01:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
okay all right
 
01:15:05.550 --> 01:15:05.560 align:start position:0%
11:00 Friday the 21st for the next
 
01:15:08.750 --> 01:15:08.760 align:start position:0%
month's fiscal yes
 
01:15:11.149 --> 01:15:11.159 align:start position:0%
welcome representative Smith I know you
 
01:15:13.790 --> 01:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
wanted to hear this audit and I think
 
01:15:15.310 --> 01:15:15.320 align:start position:0%
both you and I would be impressed from
 
01:15:16.870 --> 01:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
what we've seen in the quarterly
 
01:15:38.709 --> 01:15:38.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:43.750 --> 01:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:47.590 --> 01:15:47.600 align:start position:0%
the while you and I have are involved in
 
01:15:50.709 --> 01:15:50.719 align:start position:0%
the issues that the treasurer just
 
01:15:53.990 --> 01:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
presented and I'm always pleased to see
 
01:15:55.910 --> 01:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
how well that's going I what brought me
 
01:15:59.750 --> 01:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
here today of course is the very very
 
01:16:02.350 --> 01:16:02.360 align:start position:0%
longstanding and serious problem of the
 
01:16:05.629 --> 01:16:05.639 align:start position:0%
Human Rights Commission and I will tell
 
01:16:10.229 --> 01:16:10.239 align:start position:0%
you that the house Judiciary Committee
 
01:16:12.910 --> 01:16:12.920 align:start position:0%
uh starting in uh
 
01:16:16.990 --> 01:16:17.000 align:start position:0%
2021 has been involved in this problem
 
01:16:19.310 --> 01:16:19.320 align:start position:0%
and finally in
 
01:16:23.070 --> 01:16:23.080 align:start position:0%
2022 went to the Joint performance audit
 
01:16:25.550 --> 01:16:25.560 align:start position:0%
committee to ask for the
 
01:16:28.430 --> 01:16:28.440 align:start position:0%
um to ask for the performance audit
 
01:16:31.270 --> 01:16:31.280 align:start position:0%
knowing the incredibly fine work that
 
01:16:36.229 --> 01:16:36.239 align:start position:0%
the LBA always does and knowing what a
 
01:16:38.950 --> 01:16:38.960 align:start position:0%
difficult conundrum this was going to
 
01:16:41.950 --> 01:16:41.960 align:start position:0%
present I think they've done their usual
 
01:16:46.709 --> 01:16:46.719 align:start position:0%
incredibly fine job um where they do
 
01:16:50.310 --> 01:16:50.320 align:start position:0%
just the facts ma'am and um I will also
 
01:16:53.189 --> 01:16:53.199 align:start position:0%
tell you that while the chair of the
 
01:16:54.910 --> 01:16:54.920 align:start position:0%
house Judiciary Committee has been at
 
01:16:57.110 --> 01:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
out of the country for a few weeks he
 
01:17:00.990 --> 01:17:01.000 align:start position:0%
and I have been in uh uh touch about
 
01:17:03.990 --> 01:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
this issue and he is planning to
 
01:17:08.110 --> 01:17:08.120 align:start position:0%
schedule um a meeting to which the uh
 
01:17:11.270 --> 01:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
Human Rights Commission um and the LBA
 
01:17:15.070 --> 01:17:15.080 align:start position:0%
will be invited for them to make a
 
01:17:17.709 --> 01:17:17.719 align:start position:0%
presentation and to talk about what we
 
01:17:20.110 --> 01:17:20.120 align:start position:0%
can do and of course even under existing
 
01:17:22.990 --> 01:17:23.000 align:start position:0%
house rules although Senator gray is
 
01:17:25.510 --> 01:17:25.520 align:start position:0%
right that the Senate has so much more
 
01:17:29.830 --> 01:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
flexibility a committee can uh with good
 
01:17:33.310 --> 01:17:33.320 align:start position:0%
reason uh without regard to the ordinary
 
01:17:35.910 --> 01:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
time schedule um come forward with
 
01:17:38.270 --> 01:17:38.280 align:start position:0%
legislation so between House Bill two
 
01:17:40.350 --> 01:17:40.360 align:start position:0%
and what the house Judiciary Committee
 
01:17:44.669 --> 01:17:44.679 align:start position:0%
might do we might be able to try to see
 
01:17:47.030 --> 01:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
if we can solve a problem that's
 
01:17:49.629 --> 01:17:49.639 align:start position:0%
essential because while the easiest
 
01:17:52.149 --> 01:17:52.159 align:start position:0%
thing for us to all do is throw up our
 
01:17:54.830 --> 01:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
hands and say let's just get rid of the
 
01:17:57.470 --> 01:17:57.480 align:start position:0%
the Human Rights Commission that does
 
01:18:00.350 --> 01:18:00.360 align:start position:0%
not do justice to the citizens of the
 
01:18:04.550 --> 01:18:04.560 align:start position:0%
state who should be able to depend upon
 
01:18:08.390 --> 01:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
um a more responsible
 
01:18:12.110 --> 01:18:12.120 align:start position:0%
reliable uh commission we have the
 
01:18:14.870 --> 01:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
federal EOC at least at the moment who
 
01:18:16.910 --> 01:18:16.920 align:start position:0%
might be able to do some employment
 
01:18:19.270 --> 01:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
stuff but that's not the only problem
 
01:18:22.390 --> 01:18:22.400 align:start position:0%
and I am very appreciative of the fact
 
01:18:25.030 --> 01:18:25.040 align:start position:0%
that the fiscal committee has moved this
 
01:18:27.470 --> 01:18:27.480 align:start position:0%
along and thank you very much well I'm
 
01:18:29.590 --> 01:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
going to see to it that Mr Kaine gives
 
01:18:31.590 --> 01:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
you enough copies to present to the
 
01:18:34.350 --> 01:18:34.360 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee and give them your
 
01:18:37.030 --> 01:18:37.040 align:start position:0%
impression of of the audit delivery well
 
01:18:39.270 --> 01:18:39.280 align:start position:0%
thank you of course I know that Mr Kain
 
01:18:41.149 --> 01:18:41.159 align:start position:0%
will do absolutely everything that needs
 
01:18:43.070 --> 01:18:43.080 align:start position:0%
to be done to make this work because he
 
01:18:45.669 --> 01:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
always has Senator Waters thanks you Mr
 
01:18:48.270 --> 01:18:48.280 align:start position:0%
chairman just a comment um I'm I really
 
01:18:50.229 --> 01:18:50.239 align:start position:0%
appreciate the house Judiciary Committee
 
01:18:51.790 --> 01:18:51.800 align:start position:0%
taking this on I think we heard another
 
01:18:53.550 --> 01:18:53.560 align:start position:0%
suggestion from Senator Carson about an
 
01:18:56.149 --> 01:18:56.159 align:start position:0%
area because it does seem to me just
 
01:18:59.390 --> 01:18:59.400 align:start position:0%
aside from 10 and 13 in the audit I read
 
01:19:01.550 --> 01:19:01.560 align:start position:0%
through and I see a lot of other things
 
01:19:04.629 --> 01:19:04.639 align:start position:0%
that may require legislative uh uh
 
01:19:06.750 --> 01:19:06.760 align:start position:0%
attention and I I'm sure you'll be very
 
01:19:09.669 --> 01:19:09.679 align:start position:0%
thorough on it but um I think there's
 
01:19:12.030 --> 01:19:12.040 align:start position:0%
much more here that needs to be looked
 
01:19:13.310 --> 01:19:13.320 align:start position:0%
at from a legislative perspective than
 
01:19:15.430 --> 01:19:15.440 align:start position:0%
just 10 and 13 so I just wanted to
 
01:19:17.950 --> 01:19:17.960 align:start position:0%
mention that Mr chairman thank you the
 
01:19:19.790 --> 01:19:19.800 align:start position:0%
senator if I could comment on that CER
 
01:19:22.910 --> 01:19:22.920 align:start position:0%
where you're absolutely right um there
 
01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:26.070 align:start position:0%
where you're absolutely right um there
are

01:19:26.070 --> 01:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:28.629 --> 01:19:28.639 align:start position:0%
there have been procedures which have
 
01:19:28.639 --> 01:19:29.430 align:start position:0%
there have been procedures which have
been

01:19:29.430 --> 01:19:29.440 align:start position:0%
been
 
01:19:32.950 --> 01:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
followed which I hope this is not too
 
01:19:35.590 --> 01:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
strong a word which have been
 
01:19:39.229 --> 01:19:39.239 align:start position:0%
unconscionable um and show a a lack of
 
01:19:42.110 --> 01:19:42.120 align:start position:0%
respect for the institutions of the
 
01:19:45.629 --> 01:19:45.639 align:start position:0%
state including not only the rsas but
 
01:19:49.750 --> 01:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
the rules and um that should not be
 
01:19:53.790 --> 01:19:53.800 align:start position:0%
allowed to go on and this uh performance
 
01:19:56.350 --> 01:19:56.360 align:start position:0%
audit has cre created an opportunity for
 
01:19:59.950 --> 01:19:59.960 align:start position:0%
us to do the right thing thank you
 
01:20:02.390 --> 01:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
anything further from the committee okay
 
01:20:04.990 --> 01:20:05.000 align:start position:0%
I guess we all got a 1:00 so we will
 
01:20:23.629 --> 01:20:23.639 align:start position:0%
