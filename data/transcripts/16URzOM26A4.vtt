00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 align:start position:0%
good morning it is 1002 we're gonna get
 
00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 align:start position:0%
started special committee on housing I'm
 
00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 align:start position:0%
gonna get started with the Pledge of
 
00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.290 align:start position:0%
gonna get started with the Pledge of
Allegiance

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 align:start position:0%
pledge allegiance to the flag of the
 
00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 align:start position:0%
United States of America and to the
 
00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 align:start position:0%
Republic for which it stands one nation
 
00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
under God indivisible with liberty
 
00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:46.979 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
okay so the reason why I wanted the
 
00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 align:start position:0%
committee to get together
 
00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:54.540 align:start position:0%
um right the last week of June is to
 
00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 align:start position:0%
pretty much hash out
 
00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 align:start position:0%
um give everybody a task uh while we're
 
00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:01.259 align:start position:0%
on break and form small subcommittees on
 
00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 align:start position:0%
some of these issues we've been looking
 
00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 align:start position:0%
at so that we can get concrete language
 
00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
for the first week of September
 
00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.469 align:start position:0%
for the first week of September
so

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:09.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 align:start position:0%
um everybody should have uh this memo
 
00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:13.919 align:start position:0%
that Kristen grant our researcher put
 
00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600 align:start position:0%
together regarding
 
00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:16.919 align:start position:0%
um kind of the things that we've
 
00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
identified as impediments to Housing
 
00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 align:start position:0%
Development and some things over the
 
00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:25.199 align:start position:0%
six months of research that we've come
 
00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:28.740 align:start position:0%
up with so I kind of want to go down one
 
00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 align:start position:0%
by one and either if there's a need for
 
00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 align:start position:0%
a subcommittee or if the committee
 
00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:34.380 align:start position:0%
thinks that you know one person can
 
00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:35.880 align:start position:0%
tackle a language on this and can
 
00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
present their language at the next
 
00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 align:start position:0%
meeting that works too
 
00:05:41.749 --> 00:05:41.759 align:start position:0%
um definitely if there is a need for a
 
00:05:43.249 --> 00:05:43.259 align:start position:0%
subcommittee I'm happy to appoint a
 
00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.360 align:start position:0%
chair the only thing is that the meeting
 
00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
needs to be noticed 24 hours in advance
 
00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:50.220 align:start position:0%
and just being conquered I'll work on
 
00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:51.960 align:start position:0%
getting permission from the speaker and
 
00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:54.060 align:start position:0%
if there needs to be an exception to
 
00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:55.860 align:start position:0%
meet during break but if not the last
 
00:05:59.870 --> 00:05:59.880 align:start position:0%
the last half of August also works times
 
00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:02.039 align:start position:0%
for the subcommittee to meet on concrete
 
00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:02.810 align:start position:0%
for the subcommittee to meet on concrete
language

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:02.820 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:05.759 align:start position:0%
are there any questions on that good
 
00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:07.380 align:start position:0%
okay and then
 
00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.560 align:start position:0%
um the one thing is because there's no
 
00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:13.139 align:start position:0%
specific bill yet you're welcome to file
 
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:16.560 align:start position:0%
an amendment onto another bill and work
 
00:06:19.249 --> 00:06:19.259 align:start position:0%
work from that or
 
00:06:21.529 --> 00:06:21.539 align:start position:0%
um file a placeholder with OLS and they
 
00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:22.860 align:start position:0%
can start drafting your language I
 
00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:25.380 align:start position:0%
believe the the window is only four days
 
00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:27.720 align:start position:0%
but if we file the legislation we can
 
00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:29.639 align:start position:0%
just file a placeholder and get language
 
00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:32.039 align:start position:0%
afterwards good morning
 
00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
morning Mark
 
00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:46.740 align:start position:0%
okay so the first thing we're going to
 
00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:49.560 align:start position:0%
go down is um accessory dwelling unit so
 
00:06:50.749 --> 00:06:50.759 align:start position:0%
I'm going to kick this off to
 
00:06:52.969 --> 00:06:52.979 align:start position:0%
representative Reed and representative
 
00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:54.900 align:start position:0%
Reed first I'd love for you to go over
 
00:06:59.330 --> 00:06:59.340 align:start position:0%
kind of your language and then if if you
 
00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:00.780 align:start position:0%
think there needs to be a subcommittee
 
00:07:01.909 --> 00:07:01.919 align:start position:0%
or if
 
00:07:03.529 --> 00:07:03.539 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm Gonna Leave This up to you okay
 
00:07:04.969 --> 00:07:04.979 align:start position:0%
oh thank you all right thank you Mr
 
00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:07.380 align:start position:0%
chair uh and first of all um let me just
 
00:07:11.629 --> 00:07:11.639 align:start position:0%
uh notice the committee and you now that
 
00:07:13.969 --> 00:07:13.979 align:start position:0%
I will be leaving for a summer job in
 
00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:16.380 align:start position:0%
Alaska in two weeks I'm captaining a
 
00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:20.220 align:start position:0%
whale watch vessel and so uh I won't be
 
00:07:23.029 --> 00:07:23.039 align:start position:0%
available until October which means I
 
00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
would have to refile
 
00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:26.940 align:start position:0%
before I would be available to meet in
 
00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:28.500 align:start position:0%
person again but I'm happy to work with
 
00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:30.180 align:start position:0%
people over Zoom I'll have time to do
 
00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:33.300 align:start position:0%
all of that so um but saying having said
 
00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:36.780 align:start position:0%
that let's see if we can get as much on
 
00:07:38.809 --> 00:07:38.819 align:start position:0%
the language done
 
00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:41.880 align:start position:0%
um today so as you know as the committee
 
00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:45.720 align:start position:0%
knows the purpose of hb423 which was
 
00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
tabled this year
 
00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
was to expand our current uh buy right
 
00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:55.500 align:start position:0%
one Adu that towns cannot take away from
 
00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:00.120 align:start position:0%
homeowners to two and also increase
 
00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:03.240 align:start position:0%
um the size uh limitations that that
 
00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:05.340 align:start position:0%
towns are not allowed that's weird
 
00:08:07.969 --> 00:08:07.979 align:start position:0%
triple negative wording but um towns
 
00:08:10.189 --> 00:08:10.199 align:start position:0%
would not be allowed to restrict it
 
00:08:13.189 --> 00:08:13.199 align:start position:0%
underneath a certain size and also
 
00:08:16.129 --> 00:08:16.139 align:start position:0%
increase the definition of attached so
 
00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:20.340 align:start position:0%
that uh more different kinds of adus
 
00:08:22.969 --> 00:08:22.979 align:start position:0%
would be permitted by homeowners by the
 
00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:25.620 align:start position:0%
towns for homeowners so the amendment
 
00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:28.740 align:start position:0%
that is before you right now
 
00:08:30.409 --> 00:08:30.419 align:start position:0%
um so I'm just going to walk through the
 
00:08:31.969 --> 00:08:31.979 align:start position:0%
different sections I realize that it's
 
00:08:33.829 --> 00:08:33.839 align:start position:0%
you know a couple pages long but if you
 
00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:35.700 align:start position:0%
just would bear with me and I'm happy to
 
00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:37.320 align:start position:0%
like if people have comments or
 
00:08:39.290 --> 00:08:39.300 align:start position:0%
questions in the middle of it we can we
 
00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:40.800 align:start position:0%
can do that
 
00:08:42.589 --> 00:08:42.599 align:start position:0%
um starting with the first paragraph the
 
00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
definition of accessory dwelling unit
 
00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:46.140 align:start position:0%
originally it was defined just as
 
00:08:47.509 --> 00:08:47.519 align:start position:0%
something that was physically attached
 
00:08:50.269 --> 00:08:50.279 align:start position:0%
to the primary structure we are saying
 
00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:52.860 align:start position:0%
that it's anything on the lot itself and
 
00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:55.200 align:start position:0%
then going on further to Define what
 
00:08:58.850 --> 00:08:58.860 align:start position:0%
attached is and detached so that's where
 
00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:01.260 align:start position:0%
that strike is on line six and then the
 
00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:03.540 align:start position:0%
new language then paragraph Roman
 
00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:06.360 align:start position:0%
numeral two attached
 
00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:09.480 align:start position:0%
it there it sorry
 
00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:11.940 align:start position:0%
this one's mine
 
00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:27.650 align:start position:0%
 
perfect

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:27.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:30.829 --> 00:09:30.839 align:start position:0%
uh paragraph two defines attached
 
00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
um because we had gone back and forth
 
00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:34.440 align:start position:0%
with wording this actually needs to be
 
00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
cleaned up so it says shall also but it
 
00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
should just say shall include and then
 
00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:43.680 align:start position:0%
say in addition to units sharing a wall
 
00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:45.060 align:start position:0%
or directly attached to the primary
 
00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:47.880 align:start position:0%
dwelling shall include units that are
 
00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:49.620 align:start position:0%
within or physically connected to a
 
00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:51.240 align:start position:0%
primary single family dwelling or
 
00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:52.980 align:start position:0%
completely contained oh I'm sorry it
 
00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
does say that within or physically
 
00:09:56.449 --> 00:09:56.459 align:start position:0%
connected to the primary single
 
00:09:58.190 --> 00:09:58.200 align:start position:0%
family dwelling or completely contained
 
00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
within a pre-existing detached structure
 
00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:01.620 align:start position:0%
so we just need to strike the word also
 
00:10:03.769 --> 00:10:03.779 align:start position:0%
because it's a little bit
 
00:10:06.889 --> 00:10:06.899 align:start position:0%
confusing so what that's saying is if
 
00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:09.540 align:start position:0%
someone has a detached garage or shed or
 
00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:10.740 align:start position:0%
what have you that's already been
 
00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:12.540 align:start position:0%
approved by the town it was already
 
00:10:14.389 --> 00:10:14.399 align:start position:0%
built it already has the existing
 
00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:17.640 align:start position:0%
footprint it's not adding anything in
 
00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:19.620 align:start position:0%
terms of footprint to
 
00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:22.200 align:start position:0%
um to building if you put an Adu within
 
00:10:23.449 --> 00:10:23.459 align:start position:0%
completely contained within that
 
00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:25.500 align:start position:0%
pre-existing structure because the town
 
00:10:27.889 --> 00:10:27.899 align:start position:0%
already approved that structure to be
 
00:10:27.899 --> 00:10:28.790 align:start position:0%
already approved that structure to be
built

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
built
 
00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:30.490 align:start position:0%
built
foreign

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:30.500 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:33.180 align:start position:0%
limitation that most towns prevent most
 
00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:35.820 align:start position:0%
towns do not allow people to put an Adu
 
00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
within a detached structure
 
00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
and then it defines detached as
 
00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:42.240 align:start position:0%
something that is completely new
 
00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
completely separate
 
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.530 align:start position:0%
completely separate
yes

00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:48.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:50.220 align:start position:0%
so since you said we could ask questions
 
00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:52.260 align:start position:0%
a long time yeah it seems more efficient
 
00:10:53.569 --> 00:10:53.579 align:start position:0%
to me
 
00:10:53.579 --> 00:10:54.650 align:start position:0%
to me
um

00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:54.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:57.000 align:start position:0%
just to be clear that I'm understanding
 
00:10:59.090 --> 00:10:59.100 align:start position:0%
this correctly in Roman numeral 3 when
 
00:11:01.009 --> 00:11:01.019 align:start position:0%
you define detached and you use the
 
00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:03.480 align:start position:0%
example of an existing garage
 
00:11:07.009 --> 00:11:07.019 align:start position:0%
and if a property owner wants to build a
 
00:11:07.019 --> 00:11:08.150 align:start position:0%
and if a property owner wants to build a
separate

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:08.160 align:start position:0%
separate
 
00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:10.620 align:start position:0%
detached building on that same lot is
 
00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
that included in this definition can you
 
00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:14.940 align:start position:0%
say that one more time I'm sorry sure so
 
00:11:17.509 --> 00:11:17.519 align:start position:0%
in Roman numeral three if a property
 
00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:19.500 align:start position:0%
owner wants to build you're right a
 
00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:21.480 align:start position:0%
detached unit on that same lot it
 
00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to just be a pre-existing
 
00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:25.860 align:start position:0%
building correct detached does not
 
00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:30.240 align:start position:0%
include pre-existing building so so
 
00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:33.420 align:start position:0%
go ahead I thought your example of the
 
00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:35.420 align:start position:0%
existing garage
 
00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:38.160 align:start position:0%
that would be an attached Adu we're
 
00:11:39.949 --> 00:11:39.959 align:start position:0%
excited it's not actually attacked
 
00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
correct because that was the
 
00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
interpretation that most towns are
 
00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:46.250 align:start position:0%
interpretation that most towns are
taking

00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:46.260 align:start position:0%
taking
 
00:11:49.009 --> 00:11:49.019 align:start position:0%
um right now a town can limit a detached
 
00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
Adu completely even if you're not
 
00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:54.660 align:start position:0%
building any new structure so I had
 
00:11:56.210 --> 00:11:56.220 align:start position:0%
constituents this is actually how I got
 
00:11:58.370 --> 00:11:58.380 align:start position:0%
involved with the Adu conversation to
 
00:11:59.690 --> 00:11:59.700 align:start position:0%
begin with I had a constituent who
 
00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:01.740 align:start position:0%
wanted to build an apartment within his
 
00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:04.200 align:start position:0%
detached garage for his mother-in-law
 
00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:06.300 align:start position:0%
had Acres had you know beautiful
 
00:12:08.509 --> 00:12:08.519 align:start position:0%
farmland and in town absolutely
 
00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:10.500 align:start position:0%
prevented him even though just to pass
 
00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:12.120 align:start position:0%
by it wouldn't change the rural
 
00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:13.800 align:start position:0%
character you would never know that his
 
00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:16.680 align:start position:0%
mother was living in the garage but the
 
00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:18.120 align:start position:0%
town prevented him which I didn't think
 
00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:19.860 align:start position:0%
was reasonable especially in our housing
 
00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:22.200 align:start position:0%
situation that was several years ago so
 
00:12:23.329 --> 00:12:23.339 align:start position:0%
the housing Situation's gotten much
 
00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
worse so detached will now be only
 
00:12:28.009 --> 00:12:28.019 align:start position:0%
something that has been built
 
00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:30.660 align:start position:0%
specifically as an Adu not attached to
 
00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:37.860 align:start position:0%
thank you for having me clarify that
 
00:12:39.889 --> 00:12:39.899 align:start position:0%
um so now we get into uh starting with
 
00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:43.320 align:start position:0%
line 16 this is all existing RSA except
 
00:12:46.449 --> 00:12:46.459 align:start position:0%
for the Bold so on line 19 we're
 
00:12:48.829 --> 00:12:48.839 align:start position:0%
striking one and saying two accessory
 
00:12:50.329 --> 00:12:50.339 align:start position:0%
dwelling units will be allowed without
 
00:12:51.889 --> 00:12:51.899 align:start position:0%
additional requirement except as
 
00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:54.540 align:start position:0%
described later on we have and these are
 
00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:56.220 align:start position:0%
things that the committee can decide but
 
00:12:57.949 --> 00:12:57.959 align:start position:0%
um that I kind of put forward is what I
 
00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:00.180 align:start position:0%
think maybe might be a happy balance
 
00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:01.740 align:start position:0%
between all all interested parties
 
00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:03.720 align:start position:0%
including the municipal Association
 
00:13:06.769 --> 00:13:06.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:10.440 align:start position:0%
um so and and all but it says describing
 
00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
this section setbacks aesthetic
 
00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:13.500 align:start position:0%
requirements design review requirements
 
00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
so basically no additional requirements
 
00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:17.940 align:start position:0%
for adus except what will be described
 
00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:19.200 align:start position:0%
in just a second
 
00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:21.300 align:start position:0%
the municipality is not required to
 
00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:24.180 align:start position:0%
allow more than two units for any single
 
00:13:26.449 --> 00:13:26.459 align:start position:0%
family dwelling so they can they could
 
00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
allow three or more adus but we're
 
00:13:32.629 --> 00:13:32.639 align:start position:0%
saying you have to at least allow two
 
00:13:34.129 --> 00:13:34.139 align:start position:0%
um and I think this helps a lot of
 
00:13:35.449 --> 00:13:35.459 align:start position:0%
people because what that means is that
 
00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:37.500 align:start position:0%
you could have an in-law suite for your
 
00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
aging parents or for your adult children
 
00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:41.700 align:start position:0%
or what have you and still have a unit
 
00:13:44.629 --> 00:13:44.639 align:start position:0%
that you could rent out and add supply
 
00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:47.600 align:start position:0%
to the the market
 
00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:52.380 align:start position:0%
the rest is uh existing language it's
 
00:13:56.629 --> 00:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
important to note here that uh adus are
 
00:13:58.310 --> 00:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
not it goes in to talk about things
 
00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:00.300 align:start position:0%
attached to townhouses or manufactured
 
00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:03.420 align:start position:0%
homes or Condominiums and that because
 
00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:05.100 align:start position:0%
there was a question in the municipal
 
00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:07.980 align:start position:0%
committee well can you have an Adu onto
 
00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
a duplex and according to the the
 
00:14:12.769 --> 00:14:12.779 align:start position:0%
existing RSA which I tried to point out
 
00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:14.700 align:start position:0%
no you cannot
 
00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:16.440 align:start position:0%
if a zoning ordinance contains no
 
00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:17.940 align:start position:0%
Provisions pertaining to accessory
 
00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:19.200 align:start position:0%
dwelling units then two accessory
 
00:14:20.509 --> 00:14:20.519 align:start position:0%
dwelling units shall be deemed a
 
00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:22.380 align:start position:0%
permanent new success or a permitted
 
00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:24.540 align:start position:0%
accessory use as a matter of right so
 
00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:26.370 align:start position:0%
that just kind of continues
 
00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:27.949 align:start position:0%
that just kind of continues
[Music]

00:14:27.949 --> 00:14:27.959 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
for a test so this is the next page
 
00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
paragraph three for attached dwelling
 
00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:34.740 align:start position:0%
units an interior door the previous uh
 
00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
wording was shall I spoke with two Town
 
00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:40.500 align:start position:0%
planners when I drafted the original
 
00:14:43.189 --> 00:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
bill they didn't really understand why
 
00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:46.500 align:start position:0%
it was necessary to give an interior
 
00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:49.260 align:start position:0%
door that would connect especially if
 
00:14:51.889 --> 00:14:51.899 align:start position:0%
we're now allowing detached adus as a
 
00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:54.060 align:start position:0%
matter of right as well so we thought
 
00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
rather than striking it out just change
 
00:14:59.269 --> 00:14:59.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
representative color
 
00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:03.300 align:start position:0%
um why didn't you just write this whole
 
00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
paragraph because once you do a tat a
 
00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:18.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:21.420 align:start position:0%
that definition
 
00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:22.069 align:start position:0%
that definition
um

00:15:22.069 --> 00:15:22.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:25.129 --> 00:15:25.139 align:start position:0%
is it more expansive than the principal
 
00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:27.420 align:start position:0%
dwelling unit like the garage isn't
 
00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:28.980 align:start position:0%
technically the principal dwelling unit
 
00:15:33.069 --> 00:15:33.079 align:start position:0%
so if they could require an interior
 
00:15:36.889 --> 00:15:36.899 align:start position:0%
door between the accessory dwelling unit
 
00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:42.600 align:start position:0%
um principle dwelling unit then they've
 
00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:45.860 align:start position:0%
essentially nullified your change for
 
00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:49.260 align:start position:0%
detached so just within a existing
 
00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:51.060 align:start position:0%
structure no I agree with you but just
 
00:15:53.389 --> 00:15:53.399 align:start position:0%
so this is an amendment to my original
 
00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:55.260 align:start position:0%
bill and I had a strategic reason
 
00:15:57.710 --> 00:15:57.720 align:start position:0%
because the more you change in current
 
00:16:01.189 --> 00:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
RSA the less likely they're going to
 
00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
accept it and so I wanted to change as
 
00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
little as possible so rather than
 
00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
striking the entire paragraph I just
 
00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
stroke struck shall and changed it to
 
00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:12.300 align:start position:0%
may but may in this sentence does not
 
00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:14.820 align:start position:0%
mean the town has a right to require it
 
00:16:17.629 --> 00:16:17.639 align:start position:0%
it just says it may be provided but it
 
00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:21.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't say the town may require it
 
00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
it's a meaningless statement at this
 
00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
point it literally does not say anything
 
00:16:27.769 --> 00:16:27.779 align:start position:0%
it's just like maybe there's a door we
 
00:16:29.269 --> 00:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
don't know but it does not allow the
 
00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:32.220 align:start position:0%
town to require the door
 
00:16:35.449 --> 00:16:35.459 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to strike it
 
00:16:37.009 --> 00:16:37.019 align:start position:0%
but the reason I didn't strike it
 
00:16:38.689 --> 00:16:38.699 align:start position:0%
already was to minimize the number of
 
00:16:42.829 --> 00:16:42.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:44.940 align:start position:0%
representative Walsh
 
00:16:47.269 --> 00:16:47.279 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh just as a matter
 
00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:49.560 align:start position:0%
of History I believe I was I was here
 
00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:52.380 align:start position:0%
when this was adopted in 2013 if I'm not
 
00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
mistaken uh the reason it says shall an
 
00:16:57.829 --> 00:16:57.839 align:start position:0%
interior door shall be provided between
 
00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:00.300 align:start position:0%
the principal dwelling unit Etc is
 
00:17:03.889 --> 00:17:03.899 align:start position:0%
because the whole concept of adus was
 
00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
never intended for people in
 
00:17:07.669 --> 00:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
single-family neighborhoods to get into
 
00:17:10.610 --> 00:17:10.620 align:start position:0%
the rental business the whole purpose of
 
00:17:13.309 --> 00:17:13.319 align:start position:0%
this this chapter was to allow what it
 
00:17:15.049 --> 00:17:15.059 align:start position:0%
is an accessory dwelling unit for your
 
00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:17.640 align:start position:0%
your aging parents your kids etc etc
 
00:17:19.850 --> 00:17:19.860 align:start position:0%
that's why it said shell that was a big
 
00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:21.240 align:start position:0%
sticking point when the bill was
 
00:17:23.929 --> 00:17:23.939 align:start position:0%
originally passed thank you thank you no
 
00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for that um
 
00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:29.220 align:start position:0%
institutional memory that I even find
 
00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:31.200 align:start position:0%
now with this being my seventh year
 
00:17:33.289 --> 00:17:33.299 align:start position:0%
there's so much institutional memory I
 
00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:35.460 align:start position:0%
have compared to like maybe uh
 
00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:37.140 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of the the people who have
 
00:17:39.409 --> 00:17:39.419 align:start position:0%
been elected since I was originally so I
 
00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate that history a lot
 
00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
um the purpose of my my bill hb423 this
 
00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
year is to increase the opportunities
 
00:17:51.049 --> 00:17:51.059 align:start position:0%
for homeowners to enter the rental
 
00:17:54.430 --> 00:17:54.440 align:start position:0%
market and become landlords be because
 
00:17:57.710 --> 00:17:57.720 align:start position:0%
several fold a primarily it helps people
 
00:17:59.930 --> 00:17:59.940 align:start position:0%
buy homes if they can have a revenue
 
00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:03.780 align:start position:0%
stream off of that home B it provides
 
00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:06.900 align:start position:0%
extra housing supply to the market and
 
00:18:09.610 --> 00:18:09.620 align:start position:0%
see I think if we have a market where
 
00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
investment landlords have completely
 
00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:14.340 align:start position:0%
controlled rental units in the prices
 
00:18:16.789 --> 00:18:16.799 align:start position:0%
and the quality of rental units it's
 
00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:19.140 align:start position:0%
essentially a type of Monopoly whereas
 
00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:20.940 align:start position:0%
if you have these kind of I would call
 
00:18:23.570 --> 00:18:23.580 align:start position:0%
Mom and Pop landlords who aren't making
 
00:18:26.029 --> 00:18:26.039 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars off of rinsing out
 
00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:28.500 align:start position:0%
units but just are basically helping to
 
00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
fray their own mortgage then there's
 
00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
going to be a lot more good faith in
 
00:18:34.789 --> 00:18:34.799 align:start position:0%
that process a lot less gouging and
 
00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:36.440 align:start position:0%
predatory behavior
 
00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
amongst those types of landlords so that
 
00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:41.940 align:start position:0%
is in fact the the purpose of my
 
00:18:44.029 --> 00:18:44.039 align:start position:0%
original bill so let me let me ask
 
00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:45.660 align:start position:0%
representative Walsh on the first page
 
00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
line 29 it's paragraph two if a zoning
 
00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:49.980 align:start position:0%
audience contains no Provisions
 
00:18:52.789 --> 00:18:52.799 align:start position:0%
pertaining to adus then two shall be
 
00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:54.720 align:start position:0%
deemed permanent necessary there's
 
00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
nothing technically stopping a local
 
00:18:59.210 --> 00:18:59.220 align:start position:0%
municipality from zoning in a
 
00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:00.600 align:start position:0%
single-family neighborhood and saying no
 
00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
adus are allowed here right I mean
 
00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:04.380 align:start position:0%
that's the way I that's the way I read
 
00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
it so I see it as kind of like not
 
00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:10.340 align:start position:0%
really mattering or can you explain that
 
00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:13.860 align:start position:0%
a lot of it was passed in 2013 said that
 
00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:17.640 align:start position:0%
municipalities could not ban adus
 
00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:19.260 align:start position:0%
um this is just merely an expansion of
 
00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:22.020 align:start position:0%
it to a direction it was not intended to
 
00:19:24.650 --> 00:19:24.660 align:start position:0%
be this like she like we said allows
 
00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:27.320 align:start position:0%
people to get into the rental business
 
00:19:31.669 --> 00:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
uh in in single-family neighborhoods uh
 
00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:34.260 align:start position:0%
that's I'm just explaining what was what
 
00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
we have and what this is trying to do is
 
00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:38.220 align:start position:0%
completely different but but the bill
 
00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:40.980 align:start position:0%
that passed in 2013 it became law
 
00:19:43.549 --> 00:19:43.559 align:start position:0%
Allowed adus by rate
 
00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:46.140 align:start position:0%
and so that's where it is right now as
 
00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
far as I know okay
 
00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
one Adu by right
 
00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
the chair brings up a really good I'm
 
00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:53.880 align:start position:0%
sorry I didn't get recognized
 
00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:55.620 align:start position:0%
thank you the chair brings up a very
 
00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
good point which was that was troubling
 
00:19:59.930 --> 00:19:59.940 align:start position:0%
language to me because my understanding
 
00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:01.260 align:start position:0%
was that
 
00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:04.980 align:start position:0%
one Adu is provided by right and so I
 
00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
wasn't clear on how to interpret that
 
00:20:09.529 --> 00:20:09.539 align:start position:0%
paragraph that you just quoted so
 
00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
um and if anyone has any clarifying
 
00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
interpretation as to how that doesn't
 
00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:17.340 align:start position:0%
mean that a town can prevent adus
 
00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:19.740 align:start position:0%
completely which is what I understand is
 
00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:22.140 align:start position:0%
not the case then I would like to hear
 
00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:25.140 align:start position:0%
it well are you I mean are you okay with
 
00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
striking or changing that from two back
 
00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
to one and we'll just expand or is that
 
00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:32.700 align:start position:0%
the whole point that's the whole point
 
00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:35.820 align:start position:0%
of the bill I I almost want to suggest
 
00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:37.620 align:start position:0%
striking lines that whole paragraph
 
00:20:44.890 --> 00:20:44.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
you can continue representative okay
 
00:20:49.610 --> 00:20:49.620 align:start position:0%
um I think representative I thought
 
00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:51.240 align:start position:0%
representative De Lorenzo's hand was up
 
00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
earlier but I don't know if she forgot
 
00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
what is the purpose of the door between
 
00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
the two units
 
00:21:12.049 --> 00:21:12.059 align:start position:0%
I think that might be a better question
 
00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:13.980 align:start position:0%
for representative Walsh since he seemed
 
00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
to remember the reason that they put
 
00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:17.640 align:start position:0%
that in to begin with because I am fine
 
00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:19.860 align:start position:0%
with getting rid of that well I did get
 
00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
rid of it in the bill
 
00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:22.860 align:start position:0%
um and I'm fine with striking that
 
00:21:24.890 --> 00:21:24.900 align:start position:0%
entire paragraph entirely and saying
 
00:21:26.090 --> 00:21:26.100 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't really matter whether
 
00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:27.720 align:start position:0%
you put a door between the two units or
 
00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:28.549 align:start position:0%
you put a door between the two units or
not

00:21:28.549 --> 00:21:28.559 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:30.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:33.480 align:start position:0%
if I may as I said the original intent
 
00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:35.880 align:start position:0%
of this law when it was adopted in 2013
 
00:21:38.570 --> 00:21:38.580 align:start position:0%
I believe it was not too for people to
 
00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:40.140 align:start position:0%
get into the rental business it was to
 
00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:43.380 align:start position:0%
allow for family members a an accessory
 
00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:45.240 align:start position:0%
dwelling unit and that's the reason for
 
00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:46.200 align:start position:0%
the door
 
00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:49.080 align:start position:0%
uh so as soon as you detach it or take
 
00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
the door away now you have Apartments I
 
00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:52.380 align:start position:0%
mean that was it was for pretty much
 
00:21:55.130 --> 00:21:55.140 align:start position:0%
intended for expansion uses for family
 
00:21:57.169 --> 00:21:57.179 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative Reed
 
00:22:00.770 --> 00:22:00.780 align:start position:0%
hi thank you I will say that given the
 
00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
choice like we all know that we need
 
00:22:05.810 --> 00:22:05.820 align:start position:0%
like 60 000 units uh built and given the
 
00:22:08.029 --> 00:22:08.039 align:start position:0%
choice between a cute little garage
 
00:22:10.010 --> 00:22:10.020 align:start position:0%
apartment here and a little expansion
 
00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:12.120 align:start position:0%
because let's be very honest it's not
 
00:22:14.149 --> 00:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
like every homeowner is going to all of
 
00:22:16.130 --> 00:22:16.140 align:start position:0%
a sudden tomorrow the day after it's
 
00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
signed build an Adu but this is I think
 
00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
in Committee in the hearing we refer to
 
00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:23.820 align:start position:0%
it as gentle density it really is the
 
00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:26.580 align:start position:0%
gentlest of density and people given the
 
00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
choice because we know we have like
 
00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
nimbies we've said it in this committee
 
00:22:31.970 --> 00:22:31.980 align:start position:0%
before but given the choice between a
 
00:22:35.330 --> 00:22:35.340 align:start position:0%
massive project and this gentle density
 
00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
where there's a little tucked in
 
00:22:38.029 --> 00:22:38.039 align:start position:0%
apartment that you probably can't see
 
00:22:40.789 --> 00:22:40.799 align:start position:0%
from the road anyway here and there they
 
00:22:43.610 --> 00:22:43.620 align:start position:0%
would much rather have that and I know
 
00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:45.240 align:start position:0%
that most of the tenants would rather
 
00:22:46.850 --> 00:22:46.860 align:start position:0%
have that because that's usually a
 
00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:48.240 align:start position:0%
better relationship with your landlord
 
00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
better amenities and usually a fair
 
00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.730 align:start position:0%
better amenities and usually a fair
price

00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:52.740 align:start position:0%
price
 
00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:55.130 align:start position:0%
price
representative

00:22:55.130 --> 00:22:55.140 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:22:57.110 --> 00:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
so I want to go back to your question
 
00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:58.130 align:start position:0%
so I want to go back to your question
about

00:22:58.130 --> 00:22:58.140 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:22:58.140 --> 00:22:59.810 align:start position:0%
about
um

00:22:59.810 --> 00:22:59.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:02.280 align:start position:0%
um how if a
 
00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
uh if a zoning ordinance
 
00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:06.649 align:start position:0%
uh if a zoning ordinance
um

00:23:06.649 --> 00:23:06.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
how is this actually a requirement that
 
00:23:10.610 --> 00:23:10.620 align:start position:0%
there's there would be um accessory
 
00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
dwellings I would point you to
 
00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:15.049 align:start position:0%
dwellings I would point you to
um

00:23:15.049 --> 00:23:15.059 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
chat uh line 16 and 17 on page one it
 
00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:21.000 align:start position:0%
says a municipality that adopts a zoning
 
00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:22.500 align:start position:0%
ordinance pursuant to the authority
 
00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:24.900 align:start position:0%
granted in this chapter shall allow
 
00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
accessory dwelling units as a matter of
 
00:23:30.529 --> 00:23:30.539 align:start position:0%
right and so Roman 2 is only if they
 
00:23:35.169 --> 00:23:35.179 align:start position:0%
have not gotcha except uh done the um
 
00:23:38.090 --> 00:23:38.100 align:start position:0%
Provisions or said in their zoning
 
00:23:41.029 --> 00:23:41.039 align:start position:0%
ordinance it's allowed by right then it
 
00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:43.140 align:start position:0%
would default to they have a right way
 
00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:45.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for for that clarification
 
00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:47.400 align:start position:0%
that I was asking for earlier I
 
00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:50.100 align:start position:0%
appreciate that representative
 
00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:51.960 align:start position:0%
um if there's no further questions or
 
00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
comments okay so moving on on page two
 
00:23:57.770 --> 00:23:57.780 align:start position:0%
with paragraph Roman numeral four any
 
00:23:59.570 --> 00:23:59.580 align:start position:0%
Municipal regulation applicable to a
 
00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
single family drawing shall also apply
 
00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:02.940 align:start position:0%
to the combination of a principal
 
00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
dwelling unit in the accessory dwelling
 
00:24:06.289 --> 00:24:06.299 align:start position:0%
unit including but not limited to lot
 
00:24:08.270 --> 00:24:08.280 align:start position:0%
coverage standards and standards for
 
00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:10.140 align:start position:0%
maximum occupancy per bedroom consistent
 
00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
with the policy provided that such
 
00:24:15.049 --> 00:24:15.059 align:start position:0%
Municipal regulations shall not be more
 
00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
restrictive for adus than for the
 
00:24:19.909 --> 00:24:19.919 align:start position:0%
principal dwelling unit so the town
 
00:24:22.909 --> 00:24:22.919 align:start position:0%
can't come up with their own ordinances
 
00:24:24.770 --> 00:24:24.780 align:start position:0%
specific to adus that would prevent
 
00:24:27.789 --> 00:24:27.799 align:start position:0%
somebody who has all those regular
 
00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
ordinances apply to the house but then
 
00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:32.220 align:start position:0%
they would have additional ordinances
 
00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:34.980 align:start position:0%
for the Adu the municipality may require
 
00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
adequate parking to accommodate an
 
00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:38.460 align:start position:0%
accessory dwelling unit but shall not
 
00:24:40.549 --> 00:24:40.559 align:start position:0%
require more than one parking space per
 
00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
accessory dwelling unit on the lot this
 
00:24:43.669 --> 00:24:43.679 align:start position:0%
is something that has been brought up in
 
00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:45.900 align:start position:0%
this committee a few times I took a stab
 
00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:47.820 align:start position:0%
by saying one
 
00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:52.440 align:start position:0%
um space per Adu but I'm open to what uh
 
00:24:54.409 --> 00:24:54.419 align:start position:0%
the committee members think of this and
 
00:24:57.669 --> 00:24:57.679 align:start position:0%
also whether or not they want to specify
 
00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:00.780 align:start position:0%
off-road or on-road parking
 
00:25:02.810 --> 00:25:02.820 align:start position:0%
um whether we want to say a town cannot
 
00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
restrict based on parking spots at all
 
00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:09.240 align:start position:0%
or whether we want to have more parking
 
00:25:12.250 --> 00:25:12.260 align:start position:0%
spots per Adu as I'm sure that the
 
00:25:17.149 --> 00:25:17.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:19.380 align:start position:0%
um I'm gonna just speak for myself I
 
00:25:21.649 --> 00:25:21.659 align:start position:0%
would prefer if you do
 
00:25:24.490 --> 00:25:24.500 align:start position:0%
um shall not require more than one
 
00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:29.340 align:start position:0%
off-road parking per bedroom per Adu or
 
00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:34.260 align:start position:0%
or more than one and it may be off-road
 
00:25:37.909 --> 00:25:37.919 align:start position:0%
right no it well no oh it has to be yeah
 
00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:40.260 align:start position:0%
it shall not require more than one
 
00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:43.260 align:start position:0%
per bedroom per bedroom
 
00:25:45.409 --> 00:25:45.419 align:start position:0%
so I would allow for street parking or
 
00:25:46.909 --> 00:25:46.919 align:start position:0%
whatever okay
 
00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
I don't know how the committee feels
 
00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:51.409 align:start position:0%
I don't know how the committee feels
representative

00:25:51.409 --> 00:25:51.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:54.360 align:start position:0%
thank you if you would just inform me
 
00:25:56.330 --> 00:25:56.340 align:start position:0%
why the preference for that parking
 
00:25:58.850 --> 00:25:58.860 align:start position:0%
space being off-road well it just it
 
00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:01.140 align:start position:0%
would designate it would designate only
 
00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:04.740 align:start position:0%
one off-road I I guess like they could
 
00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:08.100 align:start position:0%
they can require two but
 
00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:11.640 align:start position:0%
can we one only one can be off-road I
 
00:26:13.789 --> 00:26:13.799 align:start position:0%
wasn't questioning about the number of
 
00:26:15.769 --> 00:26:15.779 align:start position:0%
parking spaces at the moment
 
00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
but about specifying on-road versus
 
00:26:22.370 --> 00:26:22.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:24.169 --> 00:26:24.179 align:start position:0%
to me the issue is simply there needs to
 
00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:25.620 align:start position:0%
be adequate parking I don't think it
 
00:26:27.049 --> 00:26:27.059 align:start position:0%
matters a whole lot whether it's on or
 
00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
off road
 
00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:29.940 align:start position:0%
probably matters in the winter but that
 
00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:31.980 align:start position:0%
matters no matter what
 
00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:33.720 align:start position:0%
representative Walsh and representative
 
00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:34.850 align:start position:0%
representative Walsh and representative
Reed

00:26:34.850 --> 00:26:34.860 align:start position:0%
Reed
 
00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you again Mr chairman I
 
00:26:38.450 --> 00:26:38.460 align:start position:0%
believe this came up because uh it was
 
00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:39.960 align:start position:0%
stated that some towns or something
 
00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities were actually insisting
 
00:26:44.330 --> 00:26:44.340 align:start position:0%
on six or eight parking spaces for an
 
00:26:46.669 --> 00:26:46.679 align:start position:0%
Adu as a way to get around the ordinance
 
00:26:48.649 --> 00:26:48.659 align:start position:0%
because the current rules current law
 
00:26:50.810 --> 00:26:50.820 align:start position:0%
says adequate so that's pretty
 
00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:52.440 align:start position:0%
subjective in towns were taking
 
00:26:53.930 --> 00:26:53.940 align:start position:0%
advantage of the word adequate and
 
00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
overdoing it oh complete reversal from
 
00:26:59.450 --> 00:26:59.460 align:start position:0%
that statement I think after seeing or
 
00:27:01.789 --> 00:27:01.799 align:start position:0%
being involved in planning for 12 years
 
00:27:03.649 --> 00:27:03.659 align:start position:0%
I think one
 
00:27:05.289 --> 00:27:05.299 align:start position:0%
is too little
 
00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
I think that would be problematic
 
00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
especially because some of these things
 
00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:10.380 align:start position:0%
are getting on the larger side we're
 
00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:12.120 align:start position:0%
going up to a thousand square feet which
 
00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
accommodate two bedrooms very easily
 
00:27:17.450 --> 00:27:17.460 align:start position:0%
um actually that's a ranch so yeah it
 
00:27:19.549 --> 00:27:19.559 align:start position:0%
could be three bedrooms unless it's
 
00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
unless it says otherwise so I I would
 
00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
not be in favor of the one parking uh
 
00:27:27.769 --> 00:27:27.779 align:start position:0%
whether it's on-site or off-site one per
 
00:27:29.029 --> 00:27:29.039 align:start position:0%
bedroom would you
 
00:27:31.789 --> 00:27:31.799 align:start position:0%
that would be more fair
 
00:27:34.490 --> 00:27:34.500 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chair
 
00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:37.140 align:start position:0%
um so how do we feel about splitting the
 
00:27:38.930 --> 00:27:38.940 align:start position:0%
baby between the current language and
 
00:27:42.169 --> 00:27:42.179 align:start position:0%
what the chair has suggested and say one
 
00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
parking spot per bedroom and one of
 
00:27:49.250 --> 00:27:49.260 align:start position:0%
those must be off-road
 
00:27:52.970 --> 00:27:52.980 align:start position:0%
so one off-road per Adu and for every
 
00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:54.720 align:start position:0%
extra bedroom one spot that may be
 
00:27:59.510 --> 00:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:01.250 --> 00:28:01.260 align:start position:0%
I think you're
 
00:28:03.890 --> 00:28:03.900 align:start position:0%
I think just saying
 
00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
um one parking spot per bedroom like
 
00:28:09.049 --> 00:28:09.059 align:start position:0%
obviously I prefer no parking spot
 
00:28:10.789 --> 00:28:10.799 align:start position:0%
requirements but
 
00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:13.980 align:start position:0%
um one parking spot per bedroom
 
00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:15.350 align:start position:0%
um one parking spot per bedroom
um

00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:18.730 --> 00:28:18.740 align:start position:0%
I think is uh
 
00:28:23.269 --> 00:28:23.279 align:start position:0%
one it takes up less room in the and is
 
00:28:27.169 --> 00:28:27.179 align:start position:0%
less confusing to the members
 
00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
and uh also
 
00:28:33.470 --> 00:28:33.480 align:start position:0%
I as we're discussing it if you're
 
00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:36.049 align:start position:0%
I as we're discussing it if you're
limiting

00:28:36.049 --> 00:28:36.059 align:start position:0%
limiting
 
00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:38.520 align:start position:0%
um saying oh you can only have one
 
00:28:40.850 --> 00:28:40.860 align:start position:0%
off-road but you don't say anything
 
00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:44.400 align:start position:0%
about on-road then maybe they require 10
 
00:28:47.810 --> 00:28:47.820 align:start position:0%
spaces on road and one space off-road
 
00:28:50.510 --> 00:28:50.520 align:start position:0%
and technically they're still in Rec in
 
00:28:53.330 --> 00:28:53.340 align:start position:0%
in compliance or something like that and
 
00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
so I don't want to create those
 
00:28:57.350 --> 00:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
loopholes and so if you just say one
 
00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:00.840 align:start position:0%
parking space per per bedroom then they
 
00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:03.720 align:start position:0%
can't get around that by saying okay you
 
00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
need one off-road and one on-road for
 
00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
every bedroom no no no not one office so
 
00:29:11.029 --> 00:29:11.039 align:start position:0%
just to be clear my personal preference
 
00:29:13.610 --> 00:29:13.620 align:start position:0%
is nothing like the town cannot restrict
 
00:29:17.570 --> 00:29:17.580 align:start position:0%
based on parking at all I put this in as
 
00:29:19.909 --> 00:29:19.919 align:start position:0%
a step forward towards what I presume
 
00:29:22.370 --> 00:29:22.380 align:start position:0%
the municipal Association and others
 
00:29:25.549 --> 00:29:25.559 align:start position:0%
with a similar mindset would want
 
00:29:29.269 --> 00:29:29.279 align:start position:0%
um so the what I I didn't understand the
 
00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
loophole you were describing but what
 
00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
I'm suggesting is if one per bedroom and
 
00:29:35.149 --> 00:29:35.159 align:start position:0%
I would like to say I kind of think one
 
00:29:37.370 --> 00:29:37.380 align:start position:0%
per bedroom is too onerous because if
 
00:29:39.169 --> 00:29:39.179 align:start position:0%
you have multiple bedrooms most likely
 
00:29:41.570 --> 00:29:41.580 align:start position:0%
what's happening in that situation is
 
00:29:45.409 --> 00:29:45.419 align:start position:0%
children who don't need a car right like
 
00:29:46.610 --> 00:29:46.620 align:start position:0%
you know your eight-year-old doesn't
 
00:29:49.549 --> 00:29:49.559 align:start position:0%
need a car so I think if you had a two
 
00:29:50.990 --> 00:29:51.000 align:start position:0%
bedroom or three bedroom requiring two
 
00:29:53.389 --> 00:29:53.399 align:start position:0%
or three parking spots is too onerous
 
00:29:56.930 --> 00:29:56.940 align:start position:0%
having said that if you did one per
 
00:29:59.510 --> 00:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
bedroom at all then I think it's only
 
00:30:01.130 --> 00:30:01.140 align:start position:0%
fair to allow some of those to be
 
00:30:04.610 --> 00:30:04.620 align:start position:0%
off-road and only require one on sorry
 
00:30:06.649 --> 00:30:06.659 align:start position:0%
allow some of those to be on-road and
 
00:30:09.950 --> 00:30:09.960 align:start position:0%
only require one of those for the entire
 
00:30:13.250 --> 00:30:13.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:18.289 --> 00:30:18.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:21.049 --> 00:30:21.059 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I I would be in
 
00:30:24.590 --> 00:30:24.600 align:start position:0%
favor of one parking space per bedroom I
 
00:30:26.810 --> 00:30:26.820 align:start position:0%
I just went through this process into
 
00:30:31.130 --> 00:30:31.140 align:start position:0%
town to add employee housing and one and
 
00:30:35.029 --> 00:30:35.039 align:start position:0%
one space is I think should be in there
 
00:30:39.769 --> 00:30:39.779 align:start position:0%
and if if a developer feels that that is
 
00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:42.240 align:start position:0%
onerous to them they can always go
 
00:30:44.810 --> 00:30:44.820 align:start position:0%
through an appeal process and and come
 
00:30:47.330 --> 00:30:47.340 align:start position:0%
up with congregate parking spaces which
 
00:30:50.990 --> 00:30:51.000 align:start position:0%
is what we do in my area in villages so
 
00:30:53.389 --> 00:30:53.399 align:start position:0%
I won't support open end but I will
 
00:30:56.149 --> 00:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
support one parking space per bedroom
 
00:30:58.789 --> 00:30:58.799 align:start position:0%
representable yeah thank you Mr chair
 
00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:00.120 align:start position:0%
and this is something which probably
 
00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
should be checked into uh typically and
 
00:31:05.149 --> 00:31:05.159 align:start position:0%
again we keep talking off-road on-road
 
00:31:07.549 --> 00:31:07.559 align:start position:0%
it's actually on-site off-site
 
00:31:10.010 --> 00:31:10.020 align:start position:0%
um I believe
 
00:31:12.470 --> 00:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
I don't believe you can count off-site
 
00:31:14.269 --> 00:31:14.279 align:start position:0%
parking if you're going to try to do
 
00:31:16.190 --> 00:31:16.200 align:start position:0%
something like this you should be
 
00:31:18.169 --> 00:31:18.179 align:start position:0%
looking at specifically what is required
 
00:31:21.409 --> 00:31:21.419 align:start position:0%
on site as a maximum to prohibit
 
00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities from trying to overuse
 
00:31:28.190 --> 00:31:28.200 align:start position:0%
the word adequate and make it more than
 
00:31:31.130 --> 00:31:31.140 align:start position:0%
no to make it ridiculous so I mean so
 
00:31:32.990 --> 00:31:33.000 align:start position:0%
just to clarify what you said a
 
00:31:36.529 --> 00:31:36.539 align:start position:0%
municipality cannot require 10 off-site
 
00:31:38.269 --> 00:31:38.279 align:start position:0%
parking they can only require what's on
 
00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
site in approval process usually you're
 
00:31:42.169 --> 00:31:42.179 align:start position:0%
dealing with on-site parking spaces
 
00:31:44.930 --> 00:31:44.940 align:start position:0%
again I'm in Hooksett not Manchester I
 
00:31:47.330 --> 00:31:47.340 align:start position:0%
don't know if the larger cities can
 
00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:49.200 align:start position:0%
count city streets for parking for
 
00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
development but I would guess no I just
 
00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:52.620 align:start position:0%
think it's something needs to be checked
 
00:31:55.490 --> 00:31:55.500 align:start position:0%
into okay so the language should read
 
00:31:59.810 --> 00:31:59.820 align:start position:0%
shall not require more than one on-site
 
00:32:03.169 --> 00:32:03.179 align:start position:0%
parking space per bedroom per unit
 
00:32:06.350 --> 00:32:06.360 align:start position:0%
in life okay do you get that down
 
00:32:08.510 --> 00:32:08.520 align:start position:0%
representative Reed yeah per unit per
 
00:32:11.570 --> 00:32:11.580 align:start position:0%
unit no no no no not unit
 
00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
shall not require more than one on-site
 
00:32:18.830 --> 00:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
parking space per accessory dwelling
 
00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:21.230 align:start position:0%
parking space per accessory dwelling
bedroom

00:32:21.230 --> 00:32:21.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:22.669 --> 00:32:22.679 align:start position:0%
because you don't want to be including
 
00:32:25.490 --> 00:32:25.500 align:start position:0%
the bedrooms of the actual principal
 
00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
dwelling right okay got it represent
 
00:32:30.769 --> 00:32:30.779 align:start position:0%
Broody thank you Mr chairman that's what
 
00:32:33.169 --> 00:32:33.179 align:start position:0%
I was going to bring up if we have an
 
00:32:34.909 --> 00:32:34.919 align:start position:0%
existing host right now we're going to
 
00:32:38.570 --> 00:32:38.580 align:start position:0%
put in another one bedroom unit on that
 
00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
it should work the wording should be one
 
00:32:44.269 --> 00:32:44.279 align:start position:0%
additional parking space
 
00:32:46.850 --> 00:32:46.860 align:start position:0%
so if I have a three bedroom right now
 
00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:48.600 align:start position:0%
or a four bedroom right now and I got
 
00:32:50.690 --> 00:32:50.700 align:start position:0%
two or three spaces and I want to put
 
00:32:53.269 --> 00:32:53.279 align:start position:0%
another unit on only one additional
 
00:32:55.730 --> 00:32:55.740 align:start position:0%
parking space should be required
 
00:32:57.950 --> 00:32:57.960 align:start position:0%
instead of one per bedroom
 
00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
we could ask for you know if it was a
 
00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:01.740 align:start position:0%
three bedroom house now and there's only
 
00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:03.960 align:start position:0%
two parking spaces now
 
00:33:06.350 --> 00:33:06.360 align:start position:0%
and we're going to add one more
 
00:33:08.389 --> 00:33:08.399 align:start position:0%
the way we're going one bedroom that
 
00:33:10.490 --> 00:33:10.500 align:start position:0%
would be four spaces
 
00:33:12.950 --> 00:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
so if we're going to add a unit add one
 
00:33:15.529 --> 00:33:15.539 align:start position:0%
bedroom just one additional to what's
 
00:33:18.590 --> 00:33:18.600 align:start position:0%
there now so one additional on-site
 
00:33:22.630 --> 00:33:22.640 align:start position:0%
parking space per unit right one
 
00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:25.260 align:start position:0%
additional on-site parking space per
 
00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:28.250 align:start position:0%
additional on-site parking space per
unit

00:33:28.250 --> 00:33:28.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:30.720 align:start position:0%
per bedroom per unit bedroom
 
00:33:33.889 --> 00:33:33.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:35.930 --> 00:33:35.940 align:start position:0%
sticky little technicality
 
00:33:39.409 --> 00:33:39.419 align:start position:0%
um a studio is considered zerobr or zero
 
00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
bedroom so
 
00:33:45.769 --> 00:33:45.779 align:start position:0%
when we say one packing space per why
 
00:33:47.269 --> 00:33:47.279 align:start position:0%
are you sure why are you messing with
 
00:33:50.210 --> 00:33:50.220 align:start position:0%
them maybe it should be one packing
 
00:33:52.730 --> 00:33:52.740 align:start position:0%
space per unit
 
00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:54.769 align:start position:0%
space per unit
Plus

00:33:54.769 --> 00:33:54.779 align:start position:0%
Plus
 
00:33:54.779 --> 00:33:56.750 align:start position:0%
Plus
additional

00:33:56.750 --> 00:33:56.760 align:start position:0%
additional
 
00:33:59.389 --> 00:33:59.399 align:start position:0%
and add the bedroom numbers
 
00:34:01.009 --> 00:34:01.019 align:start position:0%
so how do you how do you count a studio
 
00:34:02.810 --> 00:34:02.820 align:start position:0%
that's my question okay representative
 
00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:05.220 align:start position:0%
thank you uh thank you Mr chairman thank
 
00:34:06.889 --> 00:34:06.899 align:start position:0%
you for the question uh Department of
 
00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services considers the
 
00:34:10.909 --> 00:34:10.919 align:start position:0%
studio one bedroom
 
00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
so I I think we should we should stay
 
00:34:15.409 --> 00:34:15.419 align:start position:0%
with just ignore that stick with it okay
 
00:34:15.419 --> 00:34:18.710 align:start position:0%
with just ignore that stick with it okay
representative

00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:20.690 --> 00:34:20.700 align:start position:0%
so with all that's been said would it
 
00:34:24.470 --> 00:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
then be correct that line nine
 
00:34:27.169 --> 00:34:27.179 align:start position:0%
we take out the word adequate parking or
 
00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
that is we take it out and we replace it
 
00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:32.040 align:start position:0%
with additional and then the definitions
 
00:34:34.190 --> 00:34:34.200 align:start position:0%
that we've been floating around here I
 
00:34:35.869 --> 00:34:35.879 align:start position:0%
don't think we say adequate
 
00:34:37.810 --> 00:34:37.820 align:start position:0%
and additional Edition
 
00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
additional parking and I really want to
 
00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:43.280 align:start position:0%
Circle back around
 
00:34:49.010 --> 00:34:49.020 align:start position:0%
to it is onerous and in my mind silly to
 
00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
require two three parking spots per unit
 
00:34:57.349 --> 00:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
because children don't drive like it the
 
00:34:58.609 --> 00:34:58.619 align:start position:0%
reason and I was going to get to this
 
00:34:59.930 --> 00:34:59.940 align:start position:0%
later but I might as well bring it up
 
00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
now the reason I increased the size of
 
00:35:05.089 --> 00:35:05.099 align:start position:0%
the adus is because right now at 750
 
00:35:06.770 --> 00:35:06.780 align:start position:0%
square feet you're basically talking
 
00:35:08.990 --> 00:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
about like college students single
 
00:35:12.109 --> 00:35:12.119 align:start position:0%
people people don't have long-term
 
00:35:14.089 --> 00:35:14.099 align:start position:0%
stable housing in something that size if
 
00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
they want a dog if they want a spouse
 
00:35:18.829 --> 00:35:18.839 align:start position:0%
maybe start a family they need a little
 
00:35:21.349 --> 00:35:21.359 align:start position:0%
bit more room than 750 square feet so
 
00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
that's why I increased and that thousand
 
00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
is only for the first the one Adu any
 
00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:27.240 align:start position:0%
other additional Aid you may be
 
00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
restricted down to 850 in the languages
 
00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
I have and we can we can talk about that
 
00:35:34.609 --> 00:35:34.619 align:start position:0%
but the point is is that it's not that
 
00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
much and if you have if you do happen to
 
00:35:38.870 --> 00:35:38.880 align:start position:0%
have an Adu with an extra bedroom with
 
00:35:40.730 --> 00:35:40.740 align:start position:0%
two bedrooms that's going to be for a
 
00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
kid that's not going to be for you know
 
00:35:46.130 --> 00:35:46.140 align:start position:0%
like all these like I don't even know
 
00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:47.640 align:start position:0%
like maybe the town could restrict
 
00:35:50.329 --> 00:35:50.339 align:start position:0%
subletting of the renter who's renting
 
00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
the Adu from subletting the bedroom or
 
00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:55.200 align:start position:0%
something but
 
00:35:56.990 --> 00:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
um we're talking about people having
 
00:35:59.690 --> 00:35:59.700 align:start position:0%
kids not you know all these adults
 
00:36:03.609 --> 00:36:03.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:05.930 --> 00:36:05.940 align:start position:0%
representative yokelo
 
00:36:09.050 --> 00:36:09.060 align:start position:0%
so I think that I understand and
 
00:36:11.089 --> 00:36:11.099 align:start position:0%
obviously I agree with your points but
 
00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
it doesn't need to be that big we're
 
00:36:16.910 --> 00:36:16.920 align:start position:0%
already moving in a good direction by
 
00:36:19.790 --> 00:36:19.800 align:start position:0%
not letting them have unlimited
 
00:36:23.089 --> 00:36:23.099 align:start position:0%
number of bedrooms and so I don't think
 
00:36:24.950 --> 00:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
that this is the hill to die on in this
 
00:36:28.430 --> 00:36:28.440 align:start position:0%
in this bill and and
 
00:36:29.870 --> 00:36:29.880 align:start position:0%
um also
 
00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
um just for clarification this because
 
00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
we've passed all the deadlines and stuff
 
00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:36.240 align:start position:0%
like this this is going to be a new bill
 
00:36:38.810 --> 00:36:38.820 align:start position:0%
right and
 
00:36:40.730 --> 00:36:40.740 align:start position:0%
um in it and
 
00:36:45.589 --> 00:36:45.599 align:start position:0%
um I would prefer that um line six on
 
00:36:48.050 --> 00:36:48.060 align:start position:0%
page one be
 
00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
um not
 
00:36:54.050 --> 00:36:54.060 align:start position:0%
uh located within a lot but on a lot
 
00:36:54.060 --> 00:36:55.730 align:start position:0%
uh located within a lot but on a lot
okay

00:36:55.730 --> 00:36:55.740 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:36:59.870 --> 00:36:59.880 align:start position:0%
um and I also just for
 
00:37:03.530 --> 00:37:03.540 align:start position:0%
like my preference I think that
 
00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:04.190 align:start position:0%
like my preference I think that
um

00:37:04.190 --> 00:37:04.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:09.349 --> 00:37:09.359 align:start position:0%
that it would behoove us to consider
 
00:37:09.359 --> 00:37:10.910 align:start position:0%
that it would behoove us to consider
um

00:37:10.910 --> 00:37:10.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:15.349 --> 00:37:15.359 align:start position:0%
slicing this bill into two bills
 
00:37:18.829 --> 00:37:18.839 align:start position:0%
um specifically regarding the these
 
00:37:20.930 --> 00:37:20.940 align:start position:0%
attached detach fix
 
00:37:24.230 --> 00:37:24.240 align:start position:0%
as possibly one part of the bill and
 
00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:26.640 align:start position:0%
then the increasing the
 
00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
um number of adus to a separate bill
 
00:37:31.790 --> 00:37:31.800 align:start position:0%
since they don't they're kind of
 
00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:34.200 align:start position:0%
independent of each other and one of
 
00:37:36.770 --> 00:37:36.780 align:start position:0%
them is benef
 
00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:37.790 align:start position:0%
them is benef
um

00:37:37.790 --> 00:37:37.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:40.200 align:start position:0%
and both of them would help either if
 
00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
either of them passed and so I just you
 
00:37:45.290 --> 00:37:45.300 align:start position:0%
know if we're if we end up going into a
 
00:37:46.790 --> 00:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
subcommittee or whatever I think that
 
00:37:49.609 --> 00:37:49.619 align:start position:0%
the you know possibly
 
00:37:54.170 --> 00:37:54.180 align:start position:0%
um dividing that or considering what
 
00:37:57.290 --> 00:37:57.300 align:start position:0%
things might be able to improve like
 
00:37:59.930 --> 00:37:59.940 align:start position:0%
whether the parking requirement change
 
00:38:04.730 --> 00:38:04.740 align:start position:0%
and this attached detach thing might be
 
00:38:06.890 --> 00:38:06.900 align:start position:0%
considered like a fix to the existing
 
00:38:08.810 --> 00:38:08.820 align:start position:0%
law whereas this other thing is an
 
00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:10.550 align:start position:0%
law whereas this other thing is an
expansion

00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
expansion
 
00:38:13.250 --> 00:38:13.260 align:start position:0%
of it right and so I don't know
 
00:38:15.230 --> 00:38:15.240 align:start position:0%
something to consider recognized to
 
00:38:17.690 --> 00:38:17.700 align:start position:0%
respond thank you um I completely agree
 
00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
with you on your first couple points and
 
00:38:21.589 --> 00:38:21.599 align:start position:0%
I'm not suggesting that the parking is a
 
00:38:23.390 --> 00:38:23.400 align:start position:0%
hill I'm going to die on I think uh
 
00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
clarifying adequate is a step in the
 
00:38:27.829 --> 00:38:27.839 align:start position:0%
right direction in any case and I
 
00:38:29.990 --> 00:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely am fine with saying on
 
00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
instead of Within
 
00:38:34.130 --> 00:38:34.140 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what the difference is but
 
00:38:35.930 --> 00:38:35.940 align:start position:0%
I'm fine with it
 
00:38:39.109 --> 00:38:39.119 align:start position:0%
um I at this point I don't see the sense
 
00:38:40.910 --> 00:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
in dividing this into two bills because
 
00:38:43.370 --> 00:38:43.380 align:start position:0%
I think if it if we all can get on the
 
00:38:45.770 --> 00:38:45.780 align:start position:0%
same page about the entire thing and it
 
00:38:47.810 --> 00:38:47.820 align:start position:0%
just it hits whatever committee maybe
 
00:38:49.790 --> 00:38:49.800 align:start position:0%
this own committee with the unanimous
 
00:38:52.010 --> 00:38:52.020 align:start position:0%
recommendation of this committee I think
 
00:38:53.930 --> 00:38:53.940 align:start position:0%
it's a strong bill and it's dealing with
 
00:38:56.870 --> 00:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
the same exact RSA so I would hate to
 
00:38:59.270 --> 00:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
like parse that up and you know try to
 
00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:00.720 align:start position:0%
figure out which part belongs and what
 
00:39:03.950 --> 00:39:03.960 align:start position:0%
but if we are so what I think that we're
 
00:39:07.370 --> 00:39:07.380 align:start position:0%
at now is to say additional instead of
 
00:39:07.380 --> 00:39:08.390 align:start position:0%
at now is to say additional instead of
adequate

00:39:08.390 --> 00:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
adequate
 
00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
and to say one on-site parking space
 
00:39:15.290 --> 00:39:15.300 align:start position:0%
that they cannot require more than one
 
00:39:20.089 --> 00:39:20.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:22.730 --> 00:39:22.740 align:start position:0%
accessory dwelling unit bedroom I I'm
 
00:39:27.950 --> 00:39:27.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:30.720 align:start position:0%
per Adu bedroom
 
00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:32.450 align:start position:0%
per Adu bedroom
representative

00:39:32.450 --> 00:39:32.460 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:39:34.730 --> 00:39:34.740 align:start position:0%
representative Walsh
 
00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
actually I'm just once we're done with
 
00:39:38.109 --> 00:39:38.119 align:start position:0%
parking I just want to bring up one more
 
00:39:40.849 --> 00:39:40.859 align:start position:0%
topic before we move on is everyone okay
 
00:39:42.530 --> 00:39:42.540 align:start position:0%
with that language
 
00:39:44.930 --> 00:39:44.940 align:start position:0%
representative Damon we just asked the
 
00:39:46.609 --> 00:39:46.619 align:start position:0%
municipal Association to weigh in on
 
00:39:49.609 --> 00:39:49.619 align:start position:0%
that language I would be happy to ask Mr
 
00:39:57.290 --> 00:39:57.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:00.470 --> 00:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:01.670 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
ready

00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
ready
 
00:40:03.530 --> 00:40:03.540 align:start position:0%
um nature Grace for the municipal
 
00:40:06.349 --> 00:40:06.359 align:start position:0%
Association assuming that I've taken
 
00:40:09.050 --> 00:40:09.060 align:start position:0%
notes correctly I think what the
 
00:40:11.750 --> 00:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
committee is proposing is it would read
 
00:40:14.569 --> 00:40:14.579 align:start position:0%
a municipality may require adequate
 
00:40:16.190 --> 00:40:16.200 align:start position:0%
parking to accommodate an accessory
 
00:40:18.109 --> 00:40:18.119 align:start position:0%
dwelling unit but shall not require more
 
00:40:20.750 --> 00:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
than one additional on-site parking
 
00:40:23.930 --> 00:40:23.940 align:start position:0%
space per bedroom per accessory dwelling
 
00:40:25.790 --> 00:40:25.800 align:start position:0%
unit on the lot
 
00:40:28.010 --> 00:40:28.020 align:start position:0%
that sounds right
 
00:40:28.020 --> 00:40:29.210 align:start position:0%
that sounds right
yep

00:40:29.210 --> 00:40:29.220 align:start position:0%
yep
 
00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
representative Damon I thought we
 
00:40:33.890 --> 00:40:33.900 align:start position:0%
figured out the word adequate and put
 
00:40:35.870 --> 00:40:35.880 align:start position:0%
additional where the word adequate is
 
00:40:38.450 --> 00:40:38.460 align:start position:0%
not quite where you said I think it
 
00:40:40.069 --> 00:40:40.079 align:start position:0%
means the same but I would say that what
 
00:40:42.530 --> 00:40:42.540 align:start position:0%
I wrote in mine version which is messy a
 
00:40:44.210 --> 00:40:44.220 align:start position:0%
municipality may require additional
 
00:40:45.890 --> 00:40:45.900 align:start position:0%
parking to accommodate an accessory
 
00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:49.200 align:start position:0%
drilling unit but shall not require more
 
00:40:52.010 --> 00:40:52.020 align:start position:0%
than one on-site parking space per
 
00:40:54.050 --> 00:40:54.060 align:start position:0%
accessory dwelling unit bedroom on the
 
00:40:54.060 --> 00:40:55.670 align:start position:0%
accessory dwelling unit bedroom on the
lot

00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
lot
 
00:40:57.470 --> 00:40:57.480 align:start position:0%
which I think means the same as what you
 
00:40:58.849 --> 00:40:58.859 align:start position:0%
said yeah I don't think you need the on
 
00:41:00.650 --> 00:41:00.660 align:start position:0%
the lot just Crush out on the lot and
 
00:41:02.750 --> 00:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
just say accessory unit bedroom sure
 
00:41:06.290 --> 00:41:06.300 align:start position:0%
it's okay happy to accommodate that okay
 
00:41:08.810 --> 00:41:08.820 align:start position:0%
so did representative Damon did you want
 
00:41:10.490 --> 00:41:10.500 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association away in on that
 
00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:11.750 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association away in on that
language

00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:41:13.849 --> 00:41:13.859 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
00:41:16.510 --> 00:41:16.520 align:start position:0%
municipality may require
 
00:41:19.370 --> 00:41:19.380 align:start position:0%
uh additional parking to accommodate an
 
00:41:21.050 --> 00:41:21.060 align:start position:0%
accessory dwelling unit but shall not
 
00:41:22.490 --> 00:41:22.500 align:start position:0%
require more than
 
00:41:27.170 --> 00:41:27.180 align:start position:0%
one on-site parking space per bedroom
 
00:41:29.690 --> 00:41:29.700 align:start position:0%
per accessory dwelling unit
 
00:41:35.089 --> 00:41:35.099 align:start position:0%
I think that's clear that the maximum
 
00:41:35.099 --> 00:41:36.950 align:start position:0%
I think that's clear that the maximum
limit

00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
limit
 
00:41:39.349 --> 00:41:39.359 align:start position:0%
that could be in the local zoning
 
00:41:42.650 --> 00:41:42.660 align:start position:0%
ordinances is one space per bedroom they
 
00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
could obviously put into place something
 
00:41:46.970 --> 00:41:46.980 align:start position:0%
that's less than that so the local
 
00:41:49.130 --> 00:41:49.140 align:start position:0%
option would be you know if you're
 
00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
building a
 
00:41:52.190 --> 00:41:52.200 align:start position:0%
I don't know three bedroom accessory
 
00:41:53.569 --> 00:41:53.579 align:start position:0%
dwelling unit
 
00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:56.160 align:start position:0%
um they may only require two parking
 
00:41:58.370 --> 00:41:58.380 align:start position:0%
spaces instead of three right that's
 
00:42:01.130 --> 00:42:01.140 align:start position:0%
true so I think representative Damon
 
00:42:02.750 --> 00:42:02.760 align:start position:0%
looks a little confused so we're we're
 
00:42:05.329 --> 00:42:05.339 align:start position:0%
yeah and this is true of the entire all
 
00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
of enabling language really any enabling
 
00:42:09.290 --> 00:42:09.300 align:start position:0%
Bill gets confusing this way because
 
00:42:11.569 --> 00:42:11.579 align:start position:0%
you're not saying what the town will
 
00:42:13.569 --> 00:42:13.579 align:start position:0%
require you're saying they can't require
 
00:42:17.569 --> 00:42:17.579 align:start position:0%
more than this so we don't want a town
 
00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
to say you need 20 spaces to build an
 
00:42:22.370 --> 00:42:22.380 align:start position:0%
Adu you can't say more than one per
 
00:42:24.530 --> 00:42:24.540 align:start position:0%
bedroom but the town can say actually we
 
00:42:26.030 --> 00:42:26.040 align:start position:0%
don't need you to prove that you've
 
00:42:27.950 --> 00:42:27.960 align:start position:0%
you've got like a five Acre Farm we
 
00:42:29.390 --> 00:42:29.400 align:start position:0%
don't need you to prove that you have
 
00:42:31.450 --> 00:42:31.460 align:start position:0%
you know adequate parking or whatever
 
00:42:34.069 --> 00:42:34.079 align:start position:0%
they if they wanted to they just can't
 
00:42:35.329 --> 00:42:35.339 align:start position:0%
require more
 
00:42:38.329 --> 00:42:38.339 align:start position:0%
it's the it's the upper limit yeah
 
00:42:40.310 --> 00:42:40.320 align:start position:0%
um while I'm up here if I can make one
 
00:42:43.250 --> 00:42:43.260 align:start position:0%
other comment also from a comment that
 
00:42:44.930 --> 00:42:44.940 align:start position:0%
representative Damon made
 
00:42:47.150 --> 00:42:47.160 align:start position:0%
um under the definition of detached on
 
00:42:50.930 --> 00:42:50.940 align:start position:0%
page one section three there
 
00:42:50.940 --> 00:42:52.730 align:start position:0%
page one section three there
um

00:42:52.730 --> 00:42:52.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:52.740 --> 00:42:54.050 align:start position:0%
um
it

00:42:54.050 --> 00:42:54.060 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:42:55.970 --> 00:42:55.980 align:start position:0%
may be
 
00:42:59.630 --> 00:42:59.640 align:start position:0%
useful to include uh
 
00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:01.130 align:start position:0%
useful to include uh
the

00:43:01.130 --> 00:43:01.140 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:43:04.910 --> 00:43:04.920 align:start position:0%
part of the attached definition that
 
00:43:07.430 --> 00:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
helps Define what is attached versus
 
00:43:09.290 --> 00:43:09.300 align:start position:0%
detached so it would read something
 
00:43:11.690 --> 00:43:11.700 align:start position:0%
along the lines of detached show include
 
00:43:13.550 --> 00:43:13.560 align:start position:0%
units completely contained within a lot
 
00:43:14.930 --> 00:43:14.940 align:start position:0%
that are not physically connected to the
 
00:43:17.390 --> 00:43:17.400 align:start position:0%
primary single family dwelling or
 
00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
completely contained within pre-existing
 
00:43:22.010 --> 00:43:22.020 align:start position:0%
detached structures because
 
00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:24.720 align:start position:0%
under attached you already have defined
 
00:43:27.349 --> 00:43:27.359 align:start position:0%
everything within that right
 
00:43:30.410 --> 00:43:30.420 align:start position:0%
um you know detached garage if it's
 
00:43:32.750 --> 00:43:32.760 align:start position:0%
within then it would be
 
00:43:35.150 --> 00:43:35.160 align:start position:0%
um considered attached you're absolutely
 
00:43:38.510 --> 00:43:38.520 align:start position:0%
right Mr graze and I actually I said it
 
00:43:40.069 --> 00:43:40.079 align:start position:0%
very quickly as I was going through that
 
00:43:43.010 --> 00:43:43.020 align:start position:0%
and it's for clarity's sake okay
 
00:43:45.890 --> 00:43:45.900 align:start position:0%
anything else thank you thank you
 
00:43:48.530 --> 00:43:48.540 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
00:43:48.540 --> 00:43:49.130 align:start position:0%
all right so
um

00:43:49.130 --> 00:43:49.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:52.309 --> 00:43:52.319 align:start position:0%
the only I I think representative
 
00:43:56.390 --> 00:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
is a voice of reason and I think he's
 
00:43:56.400 --> 00:44:00.829 align:start position:0%
is a voice of reason and I think he's
right

00:44:00.829 --> 00:44:00.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:02.569 --> 00:44:02.579 align:start position:0%
I know it's going to be screened it's
 
00:44:04.370 --> 00:44:04.380 align:start position:0%
gonna be clipped
 
00:44:07.130 --> 00:44:07.140 align:start position:0%
um our next campaign there's some Merit
 
00:44:09.470 --> 00:44:09.480 align:start position:0%
to what he says in the sense of the
 
00:44:11.930 --> 00:44:11.940 align:start position:0%
heaviest lift in this bill is the one to
 
00:44:15.650 --> 00:44:15.660 align:start position:0%
two and then the easier lift is the
 
00:44:17.569 --> 00:44:17.579 align:start position:0%
clarifying definitions clarifying
 
00:44:19.490 --> 00:44:19.500 align:start position:0%
adequate parking
 
00:44:21.290 --> 00:44:21.300 align:start position:0%
um you know maybe expanding the
 
00:44:22.309 --> 00:44:22.319 align:start position:0%
definition of what it looks like
 
00:44:24.349 --> 00:44:24.359 align:start position:0%
attached detached but the
 
00:44:25.730 --> 00:44:25.740 align:start position:0%
I I don't want to speak for other
 
00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
members of the committee but I want to
 
00:44:28.550 --> 00:44:28.560 align:start position:0%
say that I think the heaviest lift is
 
00:44:31.550 --> 00:44:31.560 align:start position:0%
the one to two and I will say and this
 
00:44:32.990 --> 00:44:33.000 align:start position:0%
is true because I do a lot of like
 
00:44:37.849 --> 00:44:37.859 align:start position:0%
reform centered bills that if you reform
 
00:44:40.670 --> 00:44:40.680 align:start position:0%
a thing in a small way that frequently
 
00:44:42.650 --> 00:44:42.660 align:start position:0%
takes away the argument for the larger
 
00:44:45.349 --> 00:44:45.359 align:start position:0%
reform and I would hate to shoot the
 
00:44:47.630 --> 00:44:47.640 align:start position:0%
extension to 2A to use in the foot
 
00:44:50.089 --> 00:44:50.099 align:start position:0%
because the committee goes oh well we
 
00:44:53.210 --> 00:44:53.220 align:start position:0%
you know we increased um the uh the the
 
00:44:55.370 --> 00:44:55.380 align:start position:0%
attached and detached and the square
 
00:44:57.349 --> 00:44:57.359 align:start position:0%
footage and everything and then they're
 
00:44:58.790 --> 00:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
like so we don't need to increase it to
 
00:45:00.349 --> 00:45:00.359 align:start position:0%
two and I think two is extremely
 
00:45:02.230 --> 00:45:02.240 align:start position:0%
important both for the housing market
 
00:45:05.210 --> 00:45:05.220 align:start position:0%
and for homeowners who are looking to
 
00:45:07.670 --> 00:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
buy but need that Revenue stream
 
00:45:10.550 --> 00:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
um so I I that's my argument to keep
 
00:45:12.770 --> 00:45:12.780 align:start position:0%
them all together and to send one very
 
00:45:15.050 --> 00:45:15.060 align:start position:0%
strong Bill to the committee with the
 
00:45:17.270 --> 00:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
unanimous approval of this committee
 
00:45:19.130 --> 00:45:19.140 align:start position:0%
if we don't end up getting it ourselves
 
00:45:25.910 --> 00:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:26.990 --> 00:45:27.000 align:start position:0%
would you like to continue on your bill
 
00:45:28.550 --> 00:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
I would love to continue on if nobody
 
00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
else has anything okay okay represent
 
00:45:34.309 --> 00:45:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:36.530 --> 00:45:36.540 align:start position:0%
um we're just on right moving on from
 
00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
parking and now we're on to paragraph
 
00:45:39.950 --> 00:45:39.960 align:start position:0%
five which I don't change anything in it
 
00:45:42.109 --> 00:45:42.119 align:start position:0%
just says that a town can require
 
00:45:46.250 --> 00:45:46.260 align:start position:0%
adequate water and sewage systems so a
 
00:45:47.750 --> 00:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
septic or what have you
 
00:45:49.630 --> 00:45:49.640 align:start position:0%
that they can approve that
 
00:45:52.730 --> 00:45:52.740 align:start position:0%
uh and paragraph six says municipality
 
00:45:54.589 --> 00:45:54.599 align:start position:0%
may require owner occupancy of one of
 
00:45:55.970 --> 00:45:55.980 align:start position:0%
the dwelling units but it shall not
 
00:45:58.190 --> 00:45:58.200 align:start position:0%
specify which unit the owner must occupy
 
00:46:00.589 --> 00:46:00.599 align:start position:0%
I think this is fine this is from the
 
00:46:03.290 --> 00:46:03.300 align:start position:0%
original RSA that was current law
 
00:46:06.050 --> 00:46:06.060 align:start position:0%
um that we're saying now there's nothing
 
00:46:08.450 --> 00:46:08.460 align:start position:0%
saying that the owner then can't sell
 
00:46:12.109 --> 00:46:12.119 align:start position:0%
that house that has that uh Adu but in
 
00:46:14.089 --> 00:46:14.099 align:start position:0%
order to do this we're excluding
 
00:46:17.030 --> 00:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
developers investment developers that
 
00:46:19.010 --> 00:46:19.020 align:start position:0%
are looking to make money off of renters
 
00:46:21.589 --> 00:46:21.599 align:start position:0%
we are saying you're a homeowner this is
 
00:46:23.809 --> 00:46:23.819 align:start position:0%
your home you live there and you just
 
00:46:26.089 --> 00:46:26.099 align:start position:0%
want to build something either for a
 
00:46:29.770 --> 00:46:29.780 align:start position:0%
family member or one extra rental
 
00:46:33.829 --> 00:46:33.839 align:start position:0%
income so I think that's fine the owner
 
00:46:35.450 --> 00:46:35.460 align:start position:0%
occupancy requirement that currently
 
00:46:35.460 --> 00:46:37.010 align:start position:0%
occupancy requirement that currently
exists

00:46:37.010 --> 00:46:37.020 align:start position:0%
exists
 
00:46:39.829 --> 00:46:39.839 align:start position:0%
paragraph seven if there's nothing a
 
00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
municipality May establish standards for
 
00:46:43.309 --> 00:46:43.319 align:start position:0%
accessory dwelling units for the purpose
 
00:46:45.109 --> 00:46:45.119 align:start position:0%
of maintaining the aesthetic continuity
 
00:46:46.970 --> 00:46:46.980 align:start position:0%
of the principal dwelling unit as a
 
00:46:48.470 --> 00:46:48.480 align:start position:0%
single family dwelling Unit A
 
00:46:50.150 --> 00:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
municipality may also establish minimum
 
00:46:53.030 --> 00:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
maximum sizes for adus provided that the
 
00:46:55.130 --> 00:46:55.140 align:start position:0%
size may not be restricted to less than
 
00:46:59.030 --> 00:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
striking out 750 1000 square feet for
 
00:47:01.130 --> 00:47:01.140 align:start position:0%
one of the units Allowed by Wright and
 
00:47:03.050 --> 00:47:03.060 align:start position:0%
850 square feet for any other unit
 
00:47:05.390 --> 00:47:05.400 align:start position:0%
provided that it is the primary that
 
00:47:07.130 --> 00:47:07.140 align:start position:0%
provided and this is a new piece that I
 
00:47:08.990 --> 00:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
did add after hearing one of the
 
00:47:11.210 --> 00:47:11.220 align:start position:0%
presentations provided that if the
 
00:47:12.950 --> 00:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
primary structure is a thousand square
 
00:47:15.530 --> 00:47:15.540 align:start position:0%
feet or less the municipality May
 
00:47:17.809 --> 00:47:17.819 align:start position:0%
restrict the accessory dwelling unit to
 
00:47:20.930 --> 00:47:20.940 align:start position:0%
800 square feet so one of our presenters
 
00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
and I forget who I apologize talked
 
00:47:27.170 --> 00:47:27.180 align:start position:0%
about this being or an 80 rule being
 
00:47:29.630 --> 00:47:29.640 align:start position:0%
something that some towns do
 
00:47:31.250 --> 00:47:31.260 align:start position:0%
um saying that because you don't want
 
00:47:33.650 --> 00:47:33.660 align:start position:0%
the Adu to be larger than the primary
 
00:47:35.870 --> 00:47:35.880 align:start position:0%
dwelling unit or the primary structure
 
00:47:37.870 --> 00:47:37.880 align:start position:0%
the primary yeah marriage dwelling unit
 
00:47:40.609 --> 00:47:40.619 align:start position:0%
so that makes sense to me because then
 
00:47:42.530 --> 00:47:42.540 align:start position:0%
it kind of loses the purpose of being an
 
00:47:46.069 --> 00:47:46.079 align:start position:0%
Adu so I thought that was fine and we
 
00:47:47.870 --> 00:47:47.880 align:start position:0%
are allowing again this is not
 
00:47:50.270 --> 00:47:50.280 align:start position:0%
legislation that is saying this is what
 
00:47:51.950 --> 00:47:51.960 align:start position:0%
has to happen this is legislation
 
00:47:55.490 --> 00:47:55.500 align:start position:0%
allowing towns to do this so
 
00:47:55.500 --> 00:47:56.150 align:start position:0%
allowing towns to do this so
um

00:47:56.150 --> 00:47:56.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:58.970 --> 00:47:58.980 align:start position:0%
so is everybody clear on what that bold
 
00:48:01.790 --> 00:48:01.800 align:start position:0%
does it expands the size for the for for
 
00:48:04.609 --> 00:48:04.619 align:start position:0%
all of them but a thousand for one of
 
00:48:07.550 --> 00:48:07.560 align:start position:0%
the 80s Allowed by right 850 for any of
 
00:48:09.410 --> 00:48:09.420 align:start position:0%
them but in any case if it's a small
 
00:48:10.849 --> 00:48:10.859 align:start position:0%
house a thousand square foot house
 
00:48:13.309 --> 00:48:13.319 align:start position:0%
you're not going to build an extra
 
00:48:15.829 --> 00:48:15.839 align:start position:0%
thousand square foot um Adu onto that
 
00:48:17.630 --> 00:48:17.640 align:start position:0%
thousand square foot house
 
00:48:19.010 --> 00:48:19.020 align:start position:0%
you're going to build something that is
 
00:48:19.020 --> 00:48:21.410 align:start position:0%
you're going to build something that is
smaller

00:48:21.410 --> 00:48:21.420 align:start position:0%
smaller
 
00:48:23.930 --> 00:48:23.940 align:start position:0%
all right uh
 
00:48:26.150 --> 00:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
paragraph eight a municipality may not
 
00:48:27.710 --> 00:48:27.720 align:start position:0%
require a familial relationship between
 
00:48:29.210 --> 00:48:29.220 align:start position:0%
the occupants of the accessory dwelling
 
00:48:30.650 --> 00:48:30.660 align:start position:0%
unit and occupants of principal dwelling
 
00:48:33.290 --> 00:48:33.300 align:start position:0%
unit this is in current RSA this is law
 
00:48:36.650 --> 00:48:36.660 align:start position:0%
currently so that is I understand that
 
00:48:39.230 --> 00:48:39.240 align:start position:0%
the as representative uh Walsh said that
 
00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:40.670 align:start position:0%
the as representative uh Walsh said that
the

00:48:40.670 --> 00:48:40.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:48:42.410 --> 00:48:42.420 align:start position:0%
um the intent of the original bill in
 
00:48:45.109 --> 00:48:45.119 align:start position:0%
2013 was to extend it to family members
 
00:48:47.630 --> 00:48:47.640 align:start position:0%
but in fact the law currently in that
 
00:48:50.150 --> 00:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
bill actually made sure that it wasn't
 
00:48:53.270 --> 00:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
limited to only family members uh nine a
 
00:48:54.829 --> 00:48:54.839 align:start position:0%
municipality may not limit an accessory
 
00:48:57.770 --> 00:48:57.780 align:start position:0%
drawing unit to only one bedroom
 
00:48:58.790 --> 00:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
um I think the square footage
 
00:49:01.609 --> 00:49:01.619 align:start position:0%
restrictions are fine and then there's
 
00:49:03.050 --> 00:49:03.060 align:start position:0%
also of course those additional
 
00:49:05.089 --> 00:49:05.099 align:start position:0%
ordinances that bedrooms be of a certain
 
00:49:07.490 --> 00:49:07.500 align:start position:0%
size that the town may have uh 10 an
 
00:49:09.530 --> 00:49:09.540 align:start position:0%
accessory dwelling unit may be deemed a
 
00:49:11.270 --> 00:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
unit of Workforce housing for purposes
 
00:49:13.370 --> 00:49:13.380 align:start position:0%
of satisfying the municipality's
 
00:49:15.190 --> 00:49:15.200 align:start position:0%
obligation under RSA
 
00:49:17.630 --> 00:49:17.640 align:start position:0%
67459 if the unit meets the Criterion
 
00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:18.849 align:start position:0%
67459 if the unit meets the Criterion
RSA

00:49:18.849 --> 00:49:18.859 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
00:49:22.430 --> 00:49:22.440 align:start position:0%
674-58 four for rental units so this is
 
00:49:23.750 --> 00:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
really an important I'm going to read
 
00:49:26.089 --> 00:49:26.099 align:start position:0%
the rest of it and talk about this the
 
00:49:27.890 --> 00:49:27.900 align:start position:0%
municipality may require that if a
 
00:49:31.069 --> 00:49:31.079 align:start position:0%
property has two
 
00:49:31.079 --> 00:49:32.630 align:start position:0%
property has two
sorry

00:49:32.630 --> 00:49:32.640 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:49:34.730 --> 00:49:34.740 align:start position:0%
or more accessory dwelling units one of
 
00:49:37.250 --> 00:49:37.260 align:start position:0%
them shall meet the criteria for the
 
00:49:40.069 --> 00:49:40.079 align:start position:0%
workforce housing for rental units this
 
00:49:42.109 --> 00:49:42.119 align:start position:0%
was something I worked really closely
 
00:49:44.630 --> 00:49:44.640 align:start position:0%
with Mr Gray's of Municipal association
 
00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:46.069 align:start position:0%
with Mr Gray's of Municipal association
with

00:49:46.069 --> 00:49:46.079 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:49:48.290 --> 00:49:48.300 align:start position:0%
um this is important for two reasons
 
00:49:50.390 --> 00:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
first of all if the entire purpose of
 
00:49:52.730 --> 00:49:52.740 align:start position:0%
this bill as it was
 
00:49:56.150 --> 00:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
um is to help the housing market then we
 
00:49:57.829 --> 00:49:57.839 align:start position:0%
want to be able to meet that Workforce
 
00:50:00.829 --> 00:50:00.839 align:start position:0%
housing so this allows towns without
 
00:50:02.569 --> 00:50:02.579 align:start position:0%
building big projects without building
 
00:50:04.010 --> 00:50:04.020 align:start position:0%
big giant apartment buildings without
 
00:50:06.050 --> 00:50:06.060 align:start position:0%
these giant developments that people get
 
00:50:08.569 --> 00:50:08.579 align:start position:0%
you know nimby-esque about it allows
 
00:50:11.650 --> 00:50:11.660 align:start position:0%
towns to meet in a decentralized way
 
00:50:11.660 --> 00:50:13.210 align:start position:0%
towns to meet in a decentralized way
those

00:50:13.210 --> 00:50:13.220 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:50:15.829 --> 00:50:15.839 align:start position:0%
the workforce housing requirements so
 
00:50:20.390 --> 00:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
and help our overall housing crisis it
 
00:50:22.670 --> 00:50:22.680 align:start position:0%
also de facto because another
 
00:50:25.130 --> 00:50:25.140 align:start position:0%
consideration we were worried about and
 
00:50:26.990 --> 00:50:27.000 align:start position:0%
in my one of the early drafts of this
 
00:50:30.710 --> 00:50:30.720 align:start position:0%
bill I had prohibited or allowed towns
 
00:50:33.230 --> 00:50:33.240 align:start position:0%
to prohibit on the second unit
 
00:50:35.510 --> 00:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
um short-term rentals by putting in the
 
00:50:37.849 --> 00:50:37.859 align:start position:0%
workforce housing definition because
 
00:50:39.650 --> 00:50:39.660 align:start position:0%
short-term rentals are so much more
 
00:50:39.660 --> 00:50:41.450 align:start position:0%
short-term rentals are so much more
expensive

00:50:41.450 --> 00:50:41.460 align:start position:0%
expensive
 
00:50:44.510 --> 00:50:44.520 align:start position:0%
um this de facto allows towns to
 
00:50:49.790 --> 00:50:49.800 align:start position:0%
prohibit uh short-term rentals on uh any
 
00:50:51.950 --> 00:50:51.960 align:start position:0%
any unit that they require the workforce
 
00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
housing again they can only require it
 
00:50:57.410 --> 00:50:57.420 align:start position:0%
on uh one of the two adus they can't
 
00:50:59.390 --> 00:50:59.400 align:start position:0%
require the workforce housing rental
 
00:51:02.809 --> 00:51:02.819 align:start position:0%
limit on both but they can require it on
 
00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
one and for that one there is no that
 
00:51:07.309 --> 00:51:07.319 align:start position:0%
would de facto prevent short-term
 
00:51:11.329 --> 00:51:11.339 align:start position:0%
rentals yeah I see a hand
 
00:51:13.730 --> 00:51:13.740 align:start position:0%
um representative donkey
 
00:51:16.670 --> 00:51:16.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I would assume
 
00:51:18.430 --> 00:51:18.440 align:start position:0%
that RSA
 
00:51:23.270 --> 00:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
674-58 is a relatively short item and if
 
00:51:25.130 --> 00:51:25.140 align:start position:0%
we could committee could get a copy of
 
00:51:28.730 --> 00:51:28.740 align:start position:0%
that at some point during a break I just
 
00:51:30.650 --> 00:51:30.660 align:start position:0%
want to be able to read that
 
00:51:32.930 --> 00:51:32.940 align:start position:0%
right representative thank you I was
 
00:51:37.010 --> 00:51:37.020 align:start position:0%
looking it up as we were talking so
 
00:51:41.990 --> 00:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
um 674 58 Roman 4 reads it's the
 
00:51:44.510 --> 00:51:44.520 align:start position:0%
definition section of that's uh of of
 
00:51:46.670 --> 00:51:46.680 align:start position:0%
the workforce housing
 
00:51:50.450 --> 00:51:50.460 align:start position:0%
um it's it says Workforce housing means
 
00:51:53.089 --> 00:51:53.099 align:start position:0%
housing which is intended for sale
 
00:51:56.510 --> 00:51:56.520 align:start position:0%
and which is Affordable to a household
 
00:52:01.250 --> 00:52:01.260 align:start position:0%
with an income of no more than 100 of
 
00:52:03.170 --> 00:52:03.180 align:start position:0%
the median income for a four-person
 
00:52:06.829 --> 00:52:06.839 align:start position:0%
household for a metropolitan area or
 
00:52:09.109 --> 00:52:09.119 align:start position:0%
county in which the housing is located
 
00:52:11.930 --> 00:52:11.940 align:start position:0%
as published annually by the United

States of Housing and Urban Development
 
00:52:19.309 --> 00:52:19.319 align:start position:0%
Workforce housing also means rental
 
00:52:22.010 --> 00:52:22.020 align:start position:0%
housing which is Affordable to the
 
00:52:24.049 --> 00:52:24.059 align:start position:0%
household with an income of no more than
 
00:52:26.329 --> 00:52:26.339 align:start position:0%
60 percent of the median income for a
 
00:52:27.650 --> 00:52:27.660 align:start position:0%
three-person household for the
 
00:52:31.130 --> 00:52:31.140 align:start position:0%
metropolitan area or county in which the
 
00:52:33.309 --> 00:52:33.319 align:start position:0%
housing is located as published by
 
00:52:36.230 --> 00:52:36.240 align:start position:0%
annually by the United States Department
 
00:52:38.750 --> 00:52:38.760 align:start position:0%
of Housing and Urban Development housing
 
00:52:41.270 --> 00:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
developments that excludes minor
 
00:52:43.309 --> 00:52:43.319 align:start position:0%
children for more than 20 percent of the
 
00:52:44.690 --> 00:52:44.700 align:start position:0%
units in which
 
00:52:46.730 --> 00:52:46.740 align:start position:0%
have more than 50 percent of the
 
00:52:49.069 --> 00:52:49.079 align:start position:0%
dwelling units uh have fewer than two
 
00:52:50.630 --> 00:52:50.640 align:start position:0%
bedrooms shall not constitute Workforce
 
00:52:51.710 --> 00:52:51.720 align:start position:0%
housing for the purpose of the
 
00:52:53.630 --> 00:52:53.640 align:start position:0%
subdivision so essentially that that
 
00:52:55.250 --> 00:52:55.260 align:start position:0%
middle sentence where it's talking about
 
00:52:58.190 --> 00:52:58.200 align:start position:0%
rental is what we're talking about 60
 
00:53:00.950 --> 00:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
years 60 of the area median income so
 
00:53:03.829 --> 00:53:03.839 align:start position:0%
sixty percent of a median income for a
 
00:53:09.290 --> 00:53:09.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:13.849 --> 00:53:13.859 align:start position:0%
okay all set mark okay could be if it
 
00:53:15.410 --> 00:53:15.420 align:start position:0%
could be narrowed and I don't know that
 
00:53:17.630 --> 00:53:17.640 align:start position:0%
it can to exclude the beginning where it
 
00:53:21.950 --> 00:53:21.960 align:start position:0%
talks about sale of a unit because
 
00:53:21.960 --> 00:53:23.329 align:start position:0%
talks about sale of a unit because
um

00:53:23.329 --> 00:53:23.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:24.950 --> 00:53:24.960 align:start position:0%
I don't know if there's a point to break
 
00:53:27.530 --> 00:53:27.540 align:start position:0%
in there because the word sale is going
 
00:53:30.109 --> 00:53:30.119 align:start position:0%
to cause heartburn to some people where
 
00:53:33.049 --> 00:53:33.059 align:start position:0%
is the word sale I mean in this bill in
 
00:53:37.210 --> 00:53:37.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:41.329 --> 00:53:41.339 align:start position:0%
You couldn't possibly sell the the um
 
00:53:41.339 --> 00:53:43.430 align:start position:0%
You couldn't possibly sell the the um
the

00:53:43.430 --> 00:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:46.130 --> 00:53:46.140 align:start position:0%
accessory dwelling
 
00:53:49.130 --> 00:53:49.140 align:start position:0%
separate from the
 
00:53:52.430 --> 00:53:52.440 align:start position:0%
I I I understand I'd like to see it
 
00:53:53.870 --> 00:53:53.880 align:start position:0%
writing just so we have it and be able
 
00:53:55.790 --> 00:53:55.800 align:start position:0%
to hold it apart I think that what
 
00:53:57.950 --> 00:53:57.960 align:start position:0%
you're saying is that since this
 
00:54:00.890 --> 00:54:00.900 align:start position:0%
definition is all in one part that it
 
00:54:02.870 --> 00:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
would almost be better to just grab that
 
00:54:05.030 --> 00:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
set that middle sentence and stick it in
 
00:54:07.130 --> 00:54:07.140 align:start position:0%
the bill instead of referencing the RSA
 
00:54:09.710 --> 00:54:09.720 align:start position:0%
is what you're suggesting I I believe so
 
00:54:12.829 --> 00:54:12.839 align:start position:0%
okay okay Helen did you get that
 
00:54:12.839 --> 00:54:13.849 align:start position:0%
okay okay Helen did you get that
no

00:54:13.849 --> 00:54:13.859 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:54:15.349 --> 00:54:15.359 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:54:17.030 --> 00:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
um there's a middle can you
 
00:54:18.890 --> 00:54:18.900 align:start position:0%
can you modify
 
00:54:21.710 --> 00:54:21.720 align:start position:0%
Workforce housing also means so can you
 
00:54:23.450 --> 00:54:23.460 align:start position:0%
just read it out loud just say it out
 
00:54:26.990 --> 00:54:27.000 align:start position:0%
loud so instead of saying or or
 
00:54:31.370 --> 00:54:31.380 align:start position:0%
referencing RSA 674-58
 
00:54:35.870 --> 00:54:35.880 align:start position:0%
Roman 4. he is suggesting that you quote
 
00:54:40.970 --> 00:54:40.980 align:start position:0%
a section of that saying oh
 
00:54:44.750 --> 00:54:44.760 align:start position:0%
that qualifies uh me
 
00:54:47.569 --> 00:54:47.579 align:start position:0%
um it meets the
 
00:54:50.450 --> 00:54:50.460 align:start position:0%
um criteria of
 
00:54:53.870 --> 00:54:53.880 align:start position:0%
um affordable to a household with an
 
00:54:56.450 --> 00:54:56.460 align:start position:0%
income of no more than 60 percent of the
 
00:54:57.770 --> 00:54:57.780 align:start position:0%
median income for a three-person
 
00:54:59.870 --> 00:54:59.880 align:start position:0%
household for a metropolitan area or
 
00:55:01.609 --> 00:55:01.619 align:start position:0%
county in which the housing is located
 
00:55:03.950 --> 00:55:03.960 align:start position:0%
as published annually by the United
 
00:55:06.049 --> 00:55:06.059 align:start position:0%
States Department of Housing and Urban
 
00:55:08.990 --> 00:55:09.000 align:start position:0%
Development period okay can you read the
 
00:55:11.030 --> 00:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
part that was giving heartburn the sale
 
00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:12.290 align:start position:0%
part that was giving heartburn the sale
piece

00:55:12.290 --> 00:55:12.300 align:start position:0%
piece
 
00:55:14.870 --> 00:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
yes he did well it's referencing it's
 
00:55:16.609 --> 00:55:16.619 align:start position:0%
referencing the whole thing but yeah
 
00:55:20.329 --> 00:55:20.339 align:start position:0%
inside of the four it says Workforce
 
00:55:22.250 --> 00:55:22.260 align:start position:0%
housing means housing which is intended
 
00:55:25.010 --> 00:55:25.020 align:start position:0%
for sale and which is Affordable to and
 
00:55:26.569 --> 00:55:26.579 align:start position:0%
so he's trying to avoid that but you
 
00:55:29.270 --> 00:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
could also just say quote uh rental we
 
00:55:30.650 --> 00:55:30.660 align:start position:0%
could like just specify the rental
 
00:55:33.770 --> 00:55:33.780 align:start position:0%
portion of that section well it you kind
 
00:55:35.690 --> 00:55:35.700 align:start position:0%
of already did in the in the thing
 
00:55:39.609 --> 00:55:39.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:41.750 --> 00:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh colon
 
00:55:44.390 --> 00:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
or Roman four four rental units is
 
00:55:45.950 --> 00:55:45.960 align:start position:0%
already in the bill but he's saying hey
 
00:55:47.809 --> 00:55:47.819 align:start position:0%
what he's thinking that it should be
 
00:55:49.670 --> 00:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
more clear and just okay essentially
 
00:55:51.650 --> 00:55:51.660 align:start position:0%
take that part against reference I can
 
00:55:52.910 --> 00:55:52.920 align:start position:0%
get clarifying language to make sure
 
00:55:54.530 --> 00:55:54.540 align:start position:0%
we're pinpointing that specific section
 
00:55:54.540 --> 00:55:56.030 align:start position:0%
we're pinpointing that specific section
okay

00:55:56.030 --> 00:55:56.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:55:57.730 --> 00:55:57.740 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:56:00.049 --> 00:56:00.059 align:start position:0%
we're wrapping up we got like three more
 
00:56:02.750 --> 00:56:02.760 align:start position:0%
paragraphs and we're done uh Roman
 
00:56:05.089 --> 00:56:05.099 align:start position:0%
numeral 11 paragraph 11 a municipality
 
00:56:06.890 --> 00:56:06.900 align:start position:0%
shall allow detached accessory dwelling
 
00:56:09.170 --> 00:56:09.180 align:start position:0%
units to be cited on a lot line if the
 
00:56:11.450 --> 00:56:11.460 align:start position:0%
lot line abuts a public alley unless the
 
00:56:13.730 --> 00:56:13.740 align:start position:0%
municipality routinely plows snow on the
 
00:56:15.950 --> 00:56:15.960 align:start position:0%
public alley this is directly out of the
 
00:56:18.710 --> 00:56:18.720 align:start position:0%
missing middle uh language that a lot of
 
00:56:20.210 --> 00:56:20.220 align:start position:0%
states have adopted and that I worked
 
00:56:22.970 --> 00:56:22.980 align:start position:0%
with the oh my gosh what is the
 
00:56:25.210 --> 00:56:25.220 align:start position:0%
University people that came
 
00:56:28.490 --> 00:56:28.500 align:start position:0%
mercatus uh people this is what they
 
00:56:31.549 --> 00:56:31.559 align:start position:0%
specifically yes uh specifically
 
00:56:31.559 --> 00:56:33.890 align:start position:0%
specifically yes uh specifically
suggested

00:56:33.890 --> 00:56:33.900 align:start position:0%
suggested
 
00:56:35.089 --> 00:56:35.099 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if anybody has a problem
 
00:56:38.470 --> 00:56:38.480 align:start position:0%
with that but it seemed reasonable
 
00:56:41.510 --> 00:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
representative McConkey today
 
00:56:43.430 --> 00:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
um could I ask why it would seem
 
00:56:46.430 --> 00:56:46.440 align:start position:0%
reasonable to allow a building to be
 
00:56:48.650 --> 00:56:48.660 align:start position:0%
built on a lot line
 
00:56:51.829 --> 00:56:51.839 align:start position:0%
if if it's not a budding another owner
 
00:56:54.890 --> 00:56:54.900 align:start position:0%
but is a budding a public alley and that
 
00:56:56.890 --> 00:56:56.900 align:start position:0%
Ally is not plowed
 
00:56:59.210 --> 00:56:59.220 align:start position:0%
then that's why it'd be reasonable
 
00:57:01.069 --> 00:57:01.079 align:start position:0%
because you're not really hurting anyone
 
00:57:03.470 --> 00:57:03.480 align:start position:0%
it kind of that public alley provides
 
00:57:06.349 --> 00:57:06.359 align:start position:0%
its own buffer I
 
00:57:08.690 --> 00:57:08.700 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm thinking like blind spots and
 
00:57:10.190 --> 00:57:10.200 align:start position:0%
corners and things like that like is
 
00:57:12.349 --> 00:57:12.359 align:start position:0%
there anything that would like restrict
 
00:57:14.690 --> 00:57:14.700 align:start position:0%
a municipality from
 
00:57:17.450 --> 00:57:17.460 align:start position:0%
not allowing that I'm happy to strike it
 
00:57:19.370 --> 00:57:19.380 align:start position:0%
it was by the cheers recommendation I
 
00:57:23.270 --> 00:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
work with the mercatus center people
 
00:57:24.829 --> 00:57:24.839 align:start position:0%
um and this is what they suggested and
 
00:57:27.589 --> 00:57:27.599 align:start position:0%
it is um out of part of what's out of
 
00:57:29.450 --> 00:57:29.460 align:start position:0%
some other State's language but I'm
 
00:57:31.549 --> 00:57:31.559 align:start position:0%
happy to strike it if people find it
 
00:57:31.559 --> 00:57:34.130 align:start position:0%
happy to strike it if people find it
problematic

00:57:34.130 --> 00:57:34.140 align:start position:0%
problematic
 
00:57:37.730 --> 00:57:37.740 align:start position:0%
I think that is a good call all right
 
00:57:39.290 --> 00:57:39.300 align:start position:0%
um in that case that's what I have noted
 
00:57:41.750 --> 00:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
and um and when we get to the end of
 
00:57:43.970 --> 00:57:43.980 align:start position:0%
this I will have OLS draft up according
 
00:57:45.589 --> 00:57:45.599 align:start position:0%
to our notes today and I'll have that
 
00:57:47.329 --> 00:57:47.339 align:start position:0%
sent out to everyone
 
00:57:50.150 --> 00:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
um Roman numeral 12 a municipality
 
00:57:51.890 --> 00:57:51.900 align:start position:0%
shallow accessory drilling units to be
 
00:57:53.510 --> 00:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
converted from existing structures
 
00:57:55.549 --> 00:57:55.559 align:start position:0%
include instructors including but not
 
00:57:57.170 --> 00:57:57.180 align:start position:0%
limited to detached garages regardless
 
00:57:58.609 --> 00:57:58.619 align:start position:0%
of whether such structure violates
 
00:58:00.109 --> 00:58:00.119 align:start position:0%
current code requirements for setbacks
 
00:58:02.450 --> 00:58:02.460 align:start position:0%
or lot coverage this is also from
 
00:58:02.460 --> 00:58:03.710 align:start position:0%
or lot coverage this is also from
mercatus

00:58:03.710 --> 00:58:03.720 align:start position:0%
mercatus
 
00:58:05.990 --> 00:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
um it's really kind of in my mind like
 
00:58:08.089 --> 00:58:08.099 align:start position:0%
extra because we already kind of said
 
00:58:10.790 --> 00:58:10.800 align:start position:0%
that but I'm fine with leaving it in
 
00:58:13.670 --> 00:58:13.680 align:start position:0%
I I like the language because it's like
 
00:58:15.530 --> 00:58:15.540 align:start position:0%
already a building that is built on a
 
00:58:17.990 --> 00:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
lot and it just like if if somebody
 
00:58:19.549 --> 00:58:19.559 align:start position:0%
wants to renovate that building to make
 
00:58:21.650 --> 00:58:21.660 align:start position:0%
it an Adu right it just can't be
 
00:58:23.150 --> 00:58:23.160 align:start position:0%
restricted but it's already it's already
 
00:58:24.530 --> 00:58:24.540 align:start position:0%
an existing structure I like that
 
00:58:24.540 --> 00:58:25.309 align:start position:0%
an existing structure I like that
language

00:58:25.309 --> 00:58:25.319 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:58:28.430 --> 00:58:28.440 align:start position:0%
representative yokella yes I would agree
 
00:58:32.210 --> 00:58:32.220 align:start position:0%
with you just on the because sometimes
 
00:58:32.220 --> 00:58:33.349 align:start position:0%
with you just on the because sometimes
um

00:58:33.349 --> 00:58:33.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:33.359 --> 00:58:34.910 align:start position:0%
um
is

00:58:34.910 --> 00:58:34.920 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:58:34.920 --> 00:58:35.710 align:start position:0%
is
um

00:58:35.710 --> 00:58:35.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:38.150 --> 00:58:38.160 align:start position:0%
non-conforming structures have
 
00:58:41.390 --> 00:58:41.400 align:start position:0%
additional restrictions
 
00:58:41.400 --> 00:58:42.829 align:start position:0%
additional restrictions
um

00:58:42.829 --> 00:58:42.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:45.710 --> 00:58:45.720 align:start position:0%
and so this is essentially saying that
 
00:58:47.150 --> 00:58:47.160 align:start position:0%
you can't
 
00:58:49.609 --> 00:58:49.619 align:start position:0%
um you're still you're allowed to keep
 
00:58:51.589 --> 00:58:51.599 align:start position:0%
non-conforming structures and you should
 
00:58:54.829 --> 00:58:54.839 align:start position:0%
be able to you know modify within them
 
00:58:57.109 --> 00:58:57.119 align:start position:0%
right and so I think that the key point
 
00:58:58.849 --> 00:58:58.859 align:start position:0%
is regardless of whether such structures
 
00:59:00.589 --> 00:59:00.599 align:start position:0%
violate current code requirements for
 
00:59:02.510 --> 00:59:02.520 align:start position:0%
setbacks yeah
 
00:59:04.849 --> 00:59:04.859 align:start position:0%
um and then the final paragraph uh
 
00:59:06.770 --> 00:59:06.780 align:start position:0%
originally detached accessory dwelling
 
00:59:10.849 --> 00:59:10.859 align:start position:0%
units were allowed to be not permitted
 
00:59:13.430 --> 00:59:13.440 align:start position:0%
um towns were allowed to prohibit them
 
00:59:14.809 --> 00:59:14.819 align:start position:0%
um but we're changing that to
 
00:59:17.210 --> 00:59:17.220 align:start position:0%
municipality is required to permit
 
00:59:19.250 --> 00:59:19.260 align:start position:0%
detached accessory drawing units for at
 
00:59:20.930 --> 00:59:20.940 align:start position:0%
least one unit Allowed by right under
 
00:59:23.329 --> 00:59:23.339 align:start position:0%
this chapter but may require any other
 
00:59:26.089 --> 00:59:26.099 align:start position:0%
units to be attached detached accessory
 
00:59:27.530 --> 00:59:27.540 align:start position:0%
dwelling units shall comply with
 
00:59:29.870 --> 00:59:29.880 align:start position:0%
requirements of and any Municipal
 
00:59:31.789 --> 00:59:31.799 align:start position:0%
ordinances or regulations adopt and
 
00:59:35.630 --> 00:59:35.640 align:start position:0%
pursuant to RSA 670 472 four through
 
00:59:39.530 --> 00:59:39.540 align:start position:0%
nine and I did add this in my original
 
00:59:41.750 --> 00:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
Bill a municip and this is based on a
 
00:59:44.690 --> 00:59:44.700 align:start position:0%
couple planners recommendation a
 
00:59:46.609 --> 00:59:46.619 align:start position:0%
municipality may require a property to
 
00:59:48.589 --> 00:59:48.599 align:start position:0%
have a minimum lot size of up to one
 
00:59:50.930 --> 00:59:50.940 align:start position:0%
half acre in order to have two or more
 
00:59:52.970 --> 00:59:52.980 align:start position:0%
accessory dwelling units so that doesn't
 
00:59:55.490 --> 00:59:55.500 align:start position:0%
touch our one Adu right now it doesn't
 
00:59:56.870 --> 00:59:56.880 align:start position:0%
matter if you have an eighth of an acre
 
00:59:59.390 --> 00:59:59.400 align:start position:0%
or whatever you can still build one Adu
 
01:00:01.430 --> 01:00:01.440 align:start position:0%
what we're saying is yes that second one
 
01:00:03.890 --> 01:00:03.900 align:start position:0%
is allowed by right but the town can say
 
01:00:05.510 --> 01:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
you have to have a half acre for a
 
01:00:07.250 --> 01:00:07.260 align:start position:0%
second one
 
01:00:08.930 --> 01:00:08.940 align:start position:0%
um which I thought was reasonable
 
01:00:10.370 --> 01:00:10.380 align:start position:0%
because you are adding a whole entire
 
01:00:10.380 --> 01:00:11.150 align:start position:0%
because you are adding a whole entire
second

01:00:11.150 --> 01:00:11.160 align:start position:0%
second
 
01:00:12.349 --> 01:00:12.359 align:start position:0%
um Adu
 
01:00:13.910 --> 01:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
um but I'm happy to open that up to
 
01:00:15.349 --> 01:00:15.359 align:start position:0%
discussion and see what the committee
 
01:00:15.359 --> 01:00:16.730 align:start position:0%
discussion and see what the committee
thinks

01:00:16.730 --> 01:00:16.740 align:start position:0%
thinks
 
01:00:21.049 --> 01:00:21.059 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:24.770 --> 01:00:24.780 align:start position:0%
okay so uh representative Delorenzo
 
01:00:27.289 --> 01:00:27.299 align:start position:0%
let's have a general question
 
01:00:29.630 --> 01:00:29.640 align:start position:0%
um about unit size and you know
 
01:00:31.849 --> 01:00:31.859 align:start position:0%
requirements and is that and the
 
01:00:34.190 --> 01:00:34.200 align:start position:0%
question is that have
 
01:00:36.049 --> 01:00:36.059 align:start position:0%
you considered
 
01:00:39.530 --> 01:00:39.540 align:start position:0%
um handicapped accessible units and I'm
 
01:00:43.190 --> 01:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
asking that because I could imagine
 
01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:43.849 align:start position:0%
asking that because I could imagine
um

01:00:43.849 --> 01:00:43.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:46.730 --> 01:00:46.740 align:start position:0%
doing a Adu
 
01:00:49.190 --> 01:00:49.200 align:start position:0%
for with accessibility requirements for
 
01:00:51.170 --> 01:00:51.180 align:start position:0%
a wheelchair person
 
01:00:54.890 --> 01:00:54.900 align:start position:0%
um and then if the will the person who
 
01:00:57.710 --> 01:00:57.720 align:start position:0%
uses the wheelchair needs to have
 
01:00:59.210 --> 01:00:59.220 align:start position:0%
um an aid
 
01:01:01.970 --> 01:01:01.980 align:start position:0%
a living Aid would any of that be
 
01:01:05.329 --> 01:01:05.339 align:start position:0%
considered in the Adu bill
 
01:01:08.510 --> 01:01:08.520 align:start position:0%
well I mean there
 
01:01:10.970 --> 01:01:10.980 align:start position:0%
there's still like the like Ada that
 
01:01:15.109 --> 01:01:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:16.910 --> 01:01:16.920 align:start position:0%
well I get I get I mean does anybody
 
01:01:19.190 --> 01:01:19.200 align:start position:0%
have an answer that no yeah I'd ordered
 
01:01:21.289 --> 01:01:21.299 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't know if you can plan for
 
01:01:22.970 --> 01:01:22.980 align:start position:0%
the future like that maybe if this
 
01:01:25.609 --> 01:01:25.619 align:start position:0%
happens you know I don't think
 
01:01:27.650 --> 01:01:27.660 align:start position:0%
for our purpose I don't think that would
 
01:01:31.010 --> 01:01:31.020 align:start position:0%
work okay right representative yokella
 
01:01:35.870 --> 01:01:35.880 align:start position:0%
um I think that uh hopefully I mean what
 
01:01:37.910 --> 01:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
you're seem to be talking about is is
 
01:01:41.270 --> 01:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
there enough room for such a situation
 
01:01:43.609 --> 01:01:43.619 align:start position:0%
and hopefully
 
01:01:43.619 --> 01:01:45.410 align:start position:0%
and hopefully
um

01:01:45.410 --> 01:01:45.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:47.329 --> 01:01:47.339 align:start position:0%
personally I think that a thousand
 
01:01:50.210 --> 01:01:50.220 align:start position:0%
square feet is probably enough room to
 
01:01:52.789 --> 01:01:52.799 align:start position:0%
be able to house two people
 
01:01:55.309 --> 01:01:55.319 align:start position:0%
um in different rooms but
 
01:01:55.319 --> 01:01:56.270 align:start position:0%
um in different rooms but
um

01:01:56.270 --> 01:01:56.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:01.430 --> 01:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
but also hopefully municipalities don't
 
01:02:04.370 --> 01:02:04.380 align:start position:0%
as they seem to frequently just go to
 
01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:07.200 align:start position:0%
the bare minimum that we put in law and
 
01:02:09.289 --> 01:02:09.299 align:start position:0%
actually are more
 
01:02:09.299 --> 01:02:10.849 align:start position:0%
actually are more
um

01:02:10.849 --> 01:02:10.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:13.789 --> 01:02:13.799 align:start position:0%
allowing and so therefore if they did
 
01:02:15.530 --> 01:02:15.540 align:start position:0%
not have a size requirement then it
 
01:02:17.750 --> 01:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
would just be up to the the property
 
01:02:20.210 --> 01:02:20.220 align:start position:0%
owner to to build the
 
01:02:23.450 --> 01:02:23.460 align:start position:0%
design the thing for to meet the needs
 
01:02:25.010 --> 01:02:25.020 align:start position:0%
of the people that were planning the
 
01:02:28.010 --> 01:02:28.020 align:start position:0%
house right thank you thank you
 
01:02:30.230 --> 01:02:30.240 align:start position:0%
okay um representative Damon then
 
01:02:33.710 --> 01:02:33.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:36.710 --> 01:02:36.720 align:start position:0%
on the half acre
 
01:02:38.390 --> 01:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
um the option of municipalities
 
01:02:41.089 --> 01:02:41.099 align:start position:0%
requiring that minimum lot size
 
01:02:45.349 --> 01:02:45.359 align:start position:0%
depending on the municipality and
 
01:02:47.690 --> 01:02:47.700 align:start position:0%
the density of the area where this might
 
01:02:49.490 --> 01:02:49.500 align:start position:0%
be happening that's actually fairly
 
01:02:53.270 --> 01:02:53.280 align:start position:0%
generous and therefore it is a way to
 
01:02:55.370 --> 01:02:55.380 align:start position:0%
limit adus
 
01:02:55.380 --> 01:02:56.930 align:start position:0%
limit adus
I

01:02:56.930 --> 01:02:56.940 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:02:58.730 --> 01:02:58.740 align:start position:0%
inquire what people think about making
 
01:03:01.549 --> 01:03:01.559 align:start position:0%
it a third or a quarter or maybe yeah
 
01:03:03.829 --> 01:03:03.839 align:start position:0%
yeah that's I'm open to I have to note I
 
01:03:05.450 --> 01:03:05.460 align:start position:0%
just looked at a house with one of my
 
01:03:08.089 --> 01:03:08.099 align:start position:0%
daughters in one of the burbs north of
 
01:03:10.789 --> 01:03:10.799 align:start position:0%
New York on Friday that was a third acre
 
01:03:13.069 --> 01:03:13.079 align:start position:0%
and I was actually pretty impressed
 
01:03:15.650 --> 01:03:15.660 align:start position:0%
visually see how much third of an acre
 
01:03:17.569 --> 01:03:17.579 align:start position:0%
was I think I had a personally but
 
01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:20.640 align:start position:0%
visual of that yeah
 
01:03:23.210 --> 01:03:23.220 align:start position:0%
I did a community supported agriculture
 
01:03:25.549 --> 01:03:25.559 align:start position:0%
project and like it was the whole thing
 
01:03:26.750 --> 01:03:26.760 align:start position:0%
was like a quarter acre you'd be
 
01:03:29.150 --> 01:03:29.160 align:start position:0%
surprised it's quite large
 
01:03:32.450 --> 01:03:32.460 align:start position:0%
yeah but I'm I'm fine with reducing that
 
01:03:32.460 --> 01:03:33.650 align:start position:0%
yeah but I'm I'm fine with reducing that
down

01:03:33.650 --> 01:03:33.660 align:start position:0%
down
 
01:03:35.750 --> 01:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
um but hold on one second um
 
01:03:37.910 --> 01:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
representative Walsh
 
01:03:40.010 --> 01:03:40.020 align:start position:0%
huh yeah I'm not even sure where to
 
01:03:41.510 --> 01:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
start thank you Mr chair
 
01:03:43.309 --> 01:03:43.319 align:start position:0%
um it's funny you mentioned that you
 
01:03:45.890 --> 01:03:45.900 align:start position:0%
thought a half acre was generous I was
 
01:03:47.450 --> 01:03:47.460 align:start position:0%
going in the opposite direction of that
 
01:03:50.210 --> 01:03:50.220 align:start position:0%
of course uh because I I don't know I've
 
01:03:51.470 --> 01:03:51.480 align:start position:0%
been looking at this for a long time to
 
01:03:52.910 --> 01:03:52.920 align:start position:0%
be quite honest with you if it's okay I
 
01:03:54.950 --> 01:03:54.960 align:start position:0%
just make a statement I do give this
 
01:03:56.210 --> 01:03:56.220 align:start position:0%
stuff some thought I thought we were
 
01:03:57.710 --> 01:03:57.720 align:start position:0%
going to be looking at a bill that maybe
 
01:03:59.450 --> 01:03:59.460 align:start position:0%
changed the law around accessory
 
01:04:01.549 --> 01:04:01.559 align:start position:0%
dwelling units to prohibit
 
01:04:04.370 --> 01:04:04.380 align:start position:0%
municipalities from replacing ordinances
 
01:04:07.309 --> 01:04:07.319 align:start position:0%
in place that stop them you know as
 
01:04:10.430 --> 01:04:10.440 align:start position:0%
guide reels this is not just going to be
 
01:04:12.289 --> 01:04:12.299 align:start position:0%
a heavy lift I don't think I can get
 
01:04:13.970 --> 01:04:13.980 align:start position:0%
behind it either and and I'll tell you
 
01:04:15.289 --> 01:04:15.299 align:start position:0%
why and I'm sure I'm going to get the
 
01:04:18.170 --> 01:04:18.180 align:start position:0%
NIMBY labeling for this but
 
01:04:21.950 --> 01:04:21.960 align:start position:0%
I own 0.8 Acres I don't but according to
 
01:04:24.289 --> 01:04:24.299 align:start position:0%
this I would be able to put and it's
 
01:04:26.809 --> 01:04:26.819 align:start position:0%
only it's 100 feet wide and 450 feet
 
01:04:29.450 --> 01:04:29.460 align:start position:0%
deep I could put four units
 
01:04:31.970 --> 01:04:31.980 align:start position:0%
in mine according to this
 
01:04:34.549 --> 01:04:34.559 align:start position:0%
that's crazy but but even more than that
 
01:04:36.950 --> 01:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
my neighbor has two and a half acres how
 
01:04:39.710 --> 01:04:39.720 align:start position:0%
many buildings could they put up now the
 
01:04:42.470 --> 01:04:42.480 align:start position:0%
reason the reason when this whole Adu
 
01:04:44.089 --> 01:04:44.099 align:start position:0%
thing went into place and they were
 
01:04:44.099 --> 01:04:45.289 align:start position:0%
thing went into place and they were
attached

01:04:45.289 --> 01:04:45.299 align:start position:0%
attached
 
01:04:48.049 --> 01:04:48.059 align:start position:0%
it's so people that weren't building
 
01:04:50.569 --> 01:04:50.579 align:start position:0%
apartments all over their properties and
 
01:04:52.609 --> 01:04:52.619 align:start position:0%
why that's a problem then and I still
 
01:04:54.710 --> 01:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
think it is now again here we go with
 
01:04:56.450 --> 01:04:56.460 align:start position:0%
the NIMBY labels that's fine but if we
 
01:04:57.829 --> 01:04:57.839 align:start position:0%
don't speak our opinions what's the
 
01:05:00.049 --> 01:05:00.059 align:start position:0%
purpose even coming here if you look at
 
01:05:02.569 --> 01:05:02.579 align:start position:0%
most residential subdivisions you've got
 
01:05:04.549 --> 01:05:04.559 align:start position:0%
your front set back to house which is
 
01:05:06.589 --> 01:05:06.599 align:start position:0%
usually 50 feet even if they go more
 
01:05:08.030 --> 01:05:08.040 align:start position:0%
than that they usually have all the
 
01:05:10.370 --> 01:05:10.380 align:start position:0%
houses about the same distance off the
 
01:05:12.349 --> 01:05:12.359 align:start position:0%
road so when everybody's looking at each
 
01:05:13.789 --> 01:05:13.799 align:start position:0%
other's windows and looking in the other
 
01:05:16.490 --> 01:05:16.500 align:start position:0%
windows they accept that people use
 
01:05:17.930 --> 01:05:17.940 align:start position:0%
their backyards for their little
 
01:05:20.270 --> 01:05:20.280 align:start position:0%
Serenity their little privacy they're
 
01:05:22.190 --> 01:05:22.200 align:start position:0%
all they're a fence or a tree or a bush
 
01:05:24.410 --> 01:05:24.420 align:start position:0%
away from having some sanity and now
 
01:05:25.490 --> 01:05:25.500 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to do with this
 
01:05:27.410 --> 01:05:27.420 align:start position:0%
expansion is allow one neighbor over
 
01:05:29.569 --> 01:05:29.579 align:start position:0%
here or one neighbor over there to start
 
01:05:31.370 --> 01:05:31.380 align:start position:0%
building buildings all the way down into
 
01:05:34.789 --> 01:05:34.799 align:start position:0%
that backyard this this is crazy I
 
01:05:36.950 --> 01:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
cannot see this so that's my opinion
 
01:05:39.170 --> 01:05:39.180 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
01:05:42.770 --> 01:05:42.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for the
 
01:05:42.780 --> 01:05:44.569 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for the
um opinion

01:05:44.569 --> 01:05:44.579 align:start position:0%
um opinion
 
01:05:47.750 --> 01:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
um so first of all I need to there were
 
01:05:49.370 --> 01:05:49.380 align:start position:0%
two bills that kind of were sort of
 
01:05:52.430 --> 01:05:52.440 align:start position:0%
similar this year this bill and the four
 
01:05:53.750 --> 01:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
Plex bill
 
01:05:55.970 --> 01:05:55.980 align:start position:0%
when you say this bill would allow you
 
01:05:58.789 --> 01:05:58.799 align:start position:0%
to build four units on a 0.8 acre that
 
01:06:00.950 --> 01:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
that literally is untrue of this bill
 
01:06:04.190 --> 01:06:04.200 align:start position:0%
completely what it would do is up to
 
01:06:08.270 --> 01:06:08.280 align:start position:0%
allow you to build up to three units
 
01:06:11.150 --> 01:06:11.160 align:start position:0%
um with one having to be attached to the
 
01:06:14.089 --> 01:06:14.099 align:start position:0%
primary dwelling unit so that is all
 
01:06:16.609 --> 01:06:16.619 align:start position:0%
this bill does the four Plex bill would
 
01:06:20.809 --> 01:06:20.819 align:start position:0%
have allowed for independent units on a
 
01:06:22.910 --> 01:06:22.920 align:start position:0%
property and it would have been open to
 
01:06:25.130 --> 01:06:25.140 align:start position:0%
developers to do that meaning developers
 
01:06:26.809 --> 01:06:26.819 align:start position:0%
would that would encourage the current
 
01:06:28.849 --> 01:06:28.859 align:start position:0%
problem which is developers investment
 
01:06:31.010 --> 01:06:31.020 align:start position:0%
developers buying these uh the land up
 
01:06:34.789 --> 01:06:34.799 align:start position:0%
and building expensive buildings that is
 
01:06:36.289 --> 01:06:36.299 align:start position:0%
the problem that is why people are being
 
01:06:38.809 --> 01:06:38.819 align:start position:0%
priced out that this bill does not do
 
01:06:40.849 --> 01:06:40.859 align:start position:0%
that this bill only allows an owner
 
01:06:43.849 --> 01:06:43.859 align:start position:0%
occupier so they have to live there to
 
01:06:45.710 --> 01:06:45.720 align:start position:0%
build an extra one extra Adu than they
 
01:06:48.890 --> 01:06:48.900 align:start position:0%
already have with one of those two being
 
01:06:51.529 --> 01:06:51.539 align:start position:0%
attached having to be attached so when
 
01:06:53.329 --> 01:06:53.339 align:start position:0%
you say Apartments all over my property
 
01:06:55.010 --> 01:06:55.020 align:start position:0%
that's is literally untrue the only
 
01:06:56.690 --> 01:06:56.700 align:start position:0%
thing that you might possibly and it's
 
01:06:57.770 --> 01:06:57.780 align:start position:0%
not again it's not like everybody's
 
01:06:59.870 --> 01:06:59.880 align:start position:0%
going to do this tomorrow but you might
 
01:07:02.329 --> 01:07:02.339 align:start position:0%
possibly see an extra building go up in
 
01:07:04.609 --> 01:07:04.619 align:start position:0%
a backyard as long as it's a half acre
 
01:07:06.529 --> 01:07:06.539 align:start position:0%
or more currently according to this
 
01:07:08.029 --> 01:07:08.039 align:start position:0%
language but you would not see
 
01:07:10.549 --> 01:07:10.559 align:start position:0%
Apartments everywhere that's that's that
 
01:07:13.250 --> 01:07:13.260 align:start position:0%
is a straw man of what this bill is and
 
01:07:15.349 --> 01:07:15.359 align:start position:0%
I have said this before but I will give
 
01:07:17.569 --> 01:07:17.579 align:start position:0%
it to you again which is you only have
 
01:07:19.750 --> 01:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
two choices we are sixty thousand units
 
01:07:22.789 --> 01:07:22.799 align:start position:0%
below where we need to be for people to
 
01:07:25.670 --> 01:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
not be pushed out and homeless so you
 
01:07:28.190 --> 01:07:28.200 align:start position:0%
can either approve all these massive
 
01:07:29.930 --> 01:07:29.940 align:start position:0%
apartment buildings that neither tenants
 
01:07:32.690 --> 01:07:32.700 align:start position:0%
want nor the as you call them nimbes
 
01:07:35.450 --> 01:07:35.460 align:start position:0%
would want or you can allow regular old
 
01:07:37.370 --> 01:07:37.380 align:start position:0%
folk who are just working regular jobs
 
01:07:39.410 --> 01:07:39.420 align:start position:0%
to have one extra apartment on their lot
 
01:07:42.289 --> 01:07:42.299 align:start position:0%
if they want and that being a gentle
 
01:07:45.349 --> 01:07:45.359 align:start position:0%
over a long period of time development
 
01:07:47.870 --> 01:07:47.880 align:start position:0%
right representative Walsh
 
01:07:50.630 --> 01:07:50.640 align:start position:0%
lion 14 page three a municipality may
 
01:07:52.430 --> 01:07:52.440 align:start position:0%
require a property to have a minimum lot
 
01:07:54.529 --> 01:07:54.539 align:start position:0%
size of up to one half acre in order to
 
01:07:57.109 --> 01:07:57.119 align:start position:0%
have two or more accessory dwelling
 
01:07:59.690 --> 01:07:59.700 align:start position:0%
units we only have 15 foot setbacks
 
01:08:01.549 --> 01:08:01.559 align:start position:0%
which means on my lot according to that
 
01:08:03.170 --> 01:08:03.180 align:start position:0%
statement I could build four of them
 
01:08:04.789 --> 01:08:04.799 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:08:04.799 --> 01:08:06.109 align:start position:0%
thank you
one

01:08:06.109 --> 01:08:06.119 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:08:10.430 --> 01:08:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:15.109 --> 01:08:15.119 align:start position:0%
thank you for uh recognizing me I think
 
01:08:15.119 --> 01:08:17.110 align:start position:0%
thank you for uh recognizing me I think
um

01:08:17.110 --> 01:08:17.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:21.169 --> 01:08:21.179 align:start position:0%
one of the things in this bill is that
 
01:08:28.130 --> 01:08:28.140 align:start position:0%
it is setting a bar of a minimum and if
 
01:08:34.070 --> 01:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
the municipality chose to allow 70
 
01:08:36.169 --> 01:08:36.179 align:start position:0%
um accessory dwelling units on a
 
01:08:38.990 --> 01:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
property they are allowed to do that as
 
01:08:41.870 --> 01:08:41.880 align:start position:0%
a municipality this so what you're
 
01:08:44.450 --> 01:08:44.460 align:start position:0%
talking about is not a requirement by
 
01:08:48.010 --> 01:08:48.020 align:start position:0%
this bill that is the municipality
 
01:08:51.289 --> 01:08:51.299 align:start position:0%
allowing for accessory dwelling units
 
01:08:53.689 --> 01:08:53.699 align:start position:0%
that is not requirement under this bill
 
01:08:56.269 --> 01:08:56.279 align:start position:0%
the accessory dwelling unit requirement
 
01:09:00.110 --> 01:09:00.120 align:start position:0%
under this bill is a minimum of two and
 
01:09:03.709 --> 01:09:03.719 align:start position:0%
that and so that would only make three
 
01:09:06.650 --> 01:09:06.660 align:start position:0%
you're saying more that is the option
 
01:09:08.930 --> 01:09:08.940 align:start position:0%
for municipalities to allow as many as
 
01:09:10.130 --> 01:09:10.140 align:start position:0%
they want
 
01:09:13.070 --> 01:09:13.080 align:start position:0%
and and that would be on the
 
01:09:13.080 --> 01:09:14.809 align:start position:0%
and and that would be on the
municipality

01:09:14.809 --> 01:09:14.819 align:start position:0%
municipality
 
01:09:14.819 --> 01:09:15.590 align:start position:0%
municipality
um

01:09:15.590 --> 01:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:17.870 --> 01:09:17.880 align:start position:0%
um discretion so
 
01:09:20.749 --> 01:09:20.759 align:start position:0%
um the four is just up to municipalities
 
01:09:23.749 --> 01:09:23.759 align:start position:0%
four or five or seventy or however many
 
01:09:26.209 --> 01:09:26.219 align:start position:0%
they want is up to their
 
01:09:29.269 --> 01:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
um discretion I'd also disagree with
 
01:09:33.349 --> 01:09:33.359 align:start position:0%
that um that people don't want the
 
01:09:36.050 --> 01:09:36.060 align:start position:0%
um the rentals that are being built as
 
01:09:37.550 --> 01:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
they are
 
01:09:40.789 --> 01:09:40.799 align:start position:0%
like like completely full as soon as
 
01:09:44.390 --> 01:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
someone builds them so I I don't agree
 
01:09:47.390 --> 01:09:47.400 align:start position:0%
that that the bill that the rental units
 
01:09:50.689 --> 01:09:50.699 align:start position:0%
being built are unpopular I'm I'm gonna
 
01:09:52.849 --> 01:09:52.859 align:start position:0%
go to representative Damon
 
01:09:54.830 --> 01:09:54.840 align:start position:0%
did you have your hand up
 
01:09:56.510 --> 01:09:56.520 align:start position:0%
I did
 
01:09:59.030 --> 01:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
um thank you
 
01:10:00.590 --> 01:10:00.600 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if what I'm thinking makes
 
01:10:02.090 --> 01:10:02.100 align:start position:0%
sense so I'm just going to say it out
 
01:10:04.729 --> 01:10:04.739 align:start position:0%
loud and people will help me sort it out
 
01:10:08.030 --> 01:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
so in that last statement line 14 15 on
 
01:10:10.669 --> 01:10:10.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:12.290 --> 01:10:12.300 align:start position:0%
what happens
 
01:10:16.070 --> 01:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:18.950 --> 01:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
does that address representative Walsh's
 
01:10:21.130 --> 01:10:21.140 align:start position:0%
concern is it a little
 
01:10:23.990 --> 01:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
clearer even though it doesn't change
 
01:10:26.750 --> 01:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
the intent of the bill let me let me ask
 
01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:28.610 align:start position:0%
the intent of the bill let me let me ask
something

01:10:28.610 --> 01:10:28.620 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:10:33.050 --> 01:10:33.060 align:start position:0%
is there like language in this bill that
 
01:10:36.050 --> 01:10:36.060 align:start position:0%
you can sign off on get behind that
 
01:10:38.450 --> 01:10:38.460 align:start position:0%
would further clarify
 
01:10:42.050 --> 01:10:42.060 align:start position:0%
the current edu law or is there not I
 
01:10:43.790 --> 01:10:43.800 align:start position:0%
guess like I'm kind of trying to the
 
01:10:46.550 --> 01:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
goal is to get everybody on board so if
 
01:10:48.950 --> 01:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
there is some part of the bill you know
 
01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:49.970 align:start position:0%
there is some part of the bill you know
if

01:10:49.970 --> 01:10:49.980 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:10:51.770 --> 01:10:51.780 align:start position:0%
if there's something where we clarify
 
01:10:53.930 --> 01:10:53.940 align:start position:0%
and then you know some of the committee
 
01:10:55.729 --> 01:10:55.739 align:start position:0%
signs off on one part of the bill and
 
01:10:58.070 --> 01:10:58.080 align:start position:0%
some of it signs off on another bill I'm
 
01:10:59.750 --> 01:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
I'm okay with that too
 
01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:00.729 align:start position:0%
I'm okay with that too
um

01:11:00.729 --> 01:11:00.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:02.750 --> 01:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
representative Walsh
 
01:11:04.550 --> 01:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
um yeah thanks Mr chair yeah again like
 
01:11:06.350 --> 01:11:06.360 align:start position:0%
I said before there were certain things
 
01:11:07.850 --> 01:11:07.860 align:start position:0%
I thought we could all come to uh
 
01:11:10.130 --> 01:11:10.140 align:start position:0%
agreement on in terms of people trying
 
01:11:12.470 --> 01:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
to sabotage the the current law I get
 
01:11:13.850 --> 01:11:13.860 align:start position:0%
that and I think we should be able to do
 
01:11:15.649 --> 01:11:15.659 align:start position:0%
that in terms of what you just asked me
 
01:11:19.130 --> 01:11:19.140 align:start position:0%
with with line 14 I agree I was off by a
 
01:11:22.490 --> 01:11:22.500 align:start position:0%
unit okay I get we but I get that it's
 
01:11:24.709 --> 01:11:24.719 align:start position:0%
up to the municipalities to adopt as
 
01:11:26.990 --> 01:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
many as they want however we are still
 
01:11:30.310 --> 01:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
as a state with this law moving the bar
 
01:11:33.290 --> 01:11:33.300 align:start position:0%
it's still going to be a tough lift yeah
 
01:11:36.050 --> 01:11:36.060 align:start position:0%
okay representative Rudy thank you Mr
 
01:11:36.060 --> 01:11:37.430 align:start position:0%
okay representative Rudy thank you Mr
chairman

01:11:37.430 --> 01:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:11:39.050 --> 01:11:39.060 align:start position:0%
um what if we
 
01:11:41.930 --> 01:11:41.940 align:start position:0%
um had to have
 
01:11:46.189 --> 01:11:46.199 align:start position:0%
um take out the two or more units
 
01:11:50.570 --> 01:11:50.580 align:start position:0%
that that would help wouldn't it
 
01:11:52.130 --> 01:11:52.140 align:start position:0%
representative Reed
 
01:11:54.649 --> 01:11:54.659 align:start position:0%
so I I think I'm just going to be saying
 
01:11:56.149 --> 01:11:56.159 align:start position:0%
in a different way what representatives
 
01:11:57.950 --> 01:11:57.960 align:start position:0%
yokella and
 
01:12:00.590 --> 01:12:00.600 align:start position:0%
um Damon already said but this is not
 
01:12:02.810 --> 01:12:02.820 align:start position:0%
the only place in this bill that says or
 
01:12:05.090 --> 01:12:05.100 align:start position:0%
more and the reason it says or more is
 
01:12:07.790 --> 01:12:07.800 align:start position:0%
because a town can allow three adus 4A
 
01:12:09.290 --> 01:12:09.300 align:start position:0%
to use they can allow currently
 
01:12:11.810 --> 01:12:11.820 align:start position:0%
currently they can allow as many adus as
 
01:12:14.570 --> 01:12:14.580 align:start position:0%
they want the language of our current
 
01:12:18.110 --> 01:12:18.120 align:start position:0%
RSA says but they have to allow one and
 
01:12:20.630 --> 01:12:20.640 align:start position:0%
all I'm saying is but they have to allow
 
01:12:23.330 --> 01:12:23.340 align:start position:0%
two and one of them had they can
 
01:12:25.729 --> 01:12:25.739 align:start position:0%
restrict to being attached so the worst
 
01:12:27.770 --> 01:12:27.780 align:start position:0%
case scenario provided a town does what
 
01:12:29.689 --> 01:12:29.699 align:start position:0%
we expect that they will do which is
 
01:12:31.130 --> 01:12:31.140 align:start position:0%
restricted all the way down to what
 
01:12:33.709 --> 01:12:33.719 align:start position:0%
they're legally required to allow
 
01:12:36.110 --> 01:12:36.120 align:start position:0%
the worst case scenario the most Urban
 
01:12:39.530 --> 01:12:39.540 align:start position:0%
most apartmenty looking a property would
 
01:12:42.530 --> 01:12:42.540 align:start position:0%
be a half acre lot that has an attached
 
01:12:44.750 --> 01:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
Adu that's part of the primary structure
 
01:12:47.870 --> 01:12:47.880 align:start position:0%
and one extra building in the back
 
01:12:50.270 --> 01:12:50.280 align:start position:0%
that is the worst case scenario that is
 
01:12:52.430 --> 01:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
the most oh my God they're building
 
01:12:54.590 --> 01:12:54.600 align:start position:0%
apartments everywhere we're freaking out
 
01:12:56.450 --> 01:12:56.460 align:start position:0%
this isn't real character anymore that's
 
01:12:58.430 --> 01:12:58.440 align:start position:0%
the worst I don't think that's that bad
 
01:13:00.350 --> 01:13:00.360 align:start position:0%
it looks like in a detached garage
 
01:13:03.229 --> 01:13:03.239 align:start position:0%
that's all it looks like so
 
01:13:05.330 --> 01:13:05.340 align:start position:0%
I think we can we have to do something
 
01:13:07.610 --> 01:13:07.620 align:start position:0%
about housing that's why we exist as a
 
01:13:10.189 --> 01:13:10.199 align:start position:0%
committee we have to do something so we
 
01:13:12.590 --> 01:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
either keep doing what we've been doing
 
01:13:14.209 --> 01:13:14.219 align:start position:0%
and more and more people will be kicked
 
01:13:15.229 --> 01:13:15.239 align:start position:0%
out of the state and more and more
 
01:13:17.689 --> 01:13:17.699 align:start position:0%
people will be homeless or this this is
 
01:13:19.689 --> 01:13:19.699 align:start position:0%
the lowest hanging fruit you can imagine
 
01:13:22.669 --> 01:13:22.679 align:start position:0%
just let homeowners build one extra
 
01:13:25.070 --> 01:13:25.080 align:start position:0%
thing on their home and if you are
 
01:13:26.270 --> 01:13:26.280 align:start position:0%
scared that all of a sudden tomorrow
 
01:13:28.250 --> 01:13:28.260 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a free-for-all with all
 
01:13:31.790 --> 01:13:31.800 align:start position:0%
these adus we currently allow 1adu how
 
01:13:36.610 --> 01:13:36.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:38.689 --> 01:13:38.699 align:start position:0%
one last thing
 
01:13:41.149 --> 01:13:41.159 align:start position:0%
that is my point that currently the
 
01:13:44.090 --> 01:13:44.100 align:start position:0%
municipalities can do or approve as many
 
01:13:46.250 --> 01:13:46.260 align:start position:0%
of them as they want they just haven't
 
01:13:48.950 --> 01:13:48.960 align:start position:0%
done it yet in 11 years imagine that and
 
01:13:50.570 --> 01:13:50.580 align:start position:0%
now we're telling them we're proposing
 
01:13:52.430 --> 01:13:52.440 align:start position:0%
to tell them that now they have to thank
 
01:13:52.440 --> 01:13:53.570 align:start position:0%
to tell them that now they have to thank
you

01:13:53.570 --> 01:13:53.580 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:13:55.870 --> 01:13:55.880 align:start position:0%
so I
 
01:14:01.250 --> 01:14:01.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:05.750 --> 01:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman of all my years in
 
01:14:08.390 --> 01:14:08.400 align:start position:0%
excess of seven
 
01:14:11.390 --> 01:14:11.400 align:start position:0%
um I have a
 
01:14:13.970 --> 01:14:13.980 align:start position:0%
I've delved in a committee Public Works
 
01:14:16.370 --> 01:14:16.380 align:start position:0%
and highways where a level of passion
 
01:14:19.070 --> 01:14:19.080 align:start position:0%
never rises above and beyond asphalt and
 
01:14:20.770 --> 01:14:20.780 align:start position:0%
concrete prices
 
01:14:24.350 --> 01:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
I have prided myself have being part of
 
01:14:26.750 --> 01:14:26.760 align:start position:0%
a committee that reaches consensus or we
 
01:14:28.310 --> 01:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
don't move forward
 
01:14:33.229 --> 01:14:33.239 align:start position:0%
so the way other people conduct their
 
01:14:34.910 --> 01:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
business and their committees is what
 
01:14:37.130 --> 01:14:37.140 align:start position:0%
they are I'd like to keep this back to a
 
01:14:42.050 --> 01:14:42.060 align:start position:0%
level of not condescending but trying to
 
01:14:44.149 --> 01:14:44.159 align:start position:0%
work in cooperation
 
01:14:47.750 --> 01:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
I think I think that Anne Moore would
 
01:14:50.110 --> 01:14:50.120 align:start position:0%
make me happy to be out of there because
 
01:14:52.790 --> 01:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
towns can always do or municipalities
 
01:14:55.910 --> 01:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
can always do more if they choose to I
 
01:14:57.770 --> 01:14:57.780 align:start position:0%
think when you I think when you get to
 
01:14:59.090 --> 01:14:59.100 align:start position:0%
that line if it were to stay
 
01:15:01.070 --> 01:15:01.080 align:start position:0%
municipality may require a property of
 
01:15:03.950 --> 01:15:03.960 align:start position:0%
minimum lot size of up to one half acre
 
01:15:05.450 --> 01:15:05.460 align:start position:0%
or to have
 
01:15:09.110 --> 01:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
up to two cessary dwelling units but you
 
01:15:12.110 --> 01:15:12.120 align:start position:0%
might you might want to key it back to
 
01:15:12.120 --> 01:15:14.410 align:start position:0%
might you might want to key it back to
providing

01:15:14.410 --> 01:15:14.420 align:start position:0%
providing
 
01:15:17.930 --> 01:15:17.940 align:start position:0%
it meets the requirements there's a
 
01:15:19.729 --> 01:15:19.739 align:start position:0%
requirement in here from
 
01:15:25.669 --> 01:15:25.679 align:start position:0%
Section 5 that talks about disposal of
 
01:15:29.450 --> 01:15:29.460 align:start position:0%
sewage unless it's a municipality that
 
01:15:31.490 --> 01:15:31.500 align:start position:0%
has water and sewer
 
01:15:34.189 --> 01:15:34.199 align:start position:0%
you're never you're never going to
 
01:15:34.199 --> 01:15:35.149 align:start position:0%
you're never you're never going to
permit

01:15:35.149 --> 01:15:35.159 align:start position:0%
permit
 
01:15:38.030 --> 01:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
two accessory units to be on a lot
 
01:15:40.310 --> 01:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
that's less than a half an acre it just
 
01:15:42.169 --> 01:15:42.179 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen
 
01:15:44.570 --> 01:15:44.580 align:start position:0%
so I I think you need to tie that back
 
01:15:47.330 --> 01:15:47.340 align:start position:0%
you say it either with with Municipal
 
01:15:50.090 --> 01:15:50.100 align:start position:0%
Water and Sewer or just say per the
 
01:15:53.330 --> 01:15:53.340 align:start position:0%
requirements of number five because in
 
01:15:55.250 --> 01:15:55.260 align:start position:0%
my neck of the woods where we don't have
 
01:15:58.070 --> 01:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
water and sewer that you're you're
 
01:16:00.590 --> 01:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
giving a glimmer of hope to a developer
 
01:16:03.890 --> 01:16:03.900 align:start position:0%
that they can never get to so if the
 
01:16:05.510 --> 01:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
goal is to get through this through
 
01:16:08.270 --> 01:16:08.280 align:start position:0%
today so that we can have an individual
 
01:16:10.850 --> 01:16:10.860 align:start position:0%
bill then I say nay if we're going to
 
01:16:13.790 --> 01:16:13.800 align:start position:0%
work on it I'm happy to work on it
 
01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:15.290 align:start position:0%
work on it I'm happy to work on it
okay

01:16:15.290 --> 01:16:15.300 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:16:19.189 --> 01:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
representative Reed thank you Mr chair
 
01:16:21.350 --> 01:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
um so right now this is the most
 
01:16:22.970 --> 01:16:22.980 align:start position:0%
restrictive form of what you're saying
 
01:16:24.410 --> 01:16:24.420 align:start position:0%
what you're suggesting would actually
 
01:16:26.689 --> 01:16:26.699 align:start position:0%
make it less restrictive we're saying
 
01:16:29.510 --> 01:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
currently the town can require a half
 
01:16:32.149 --> 01:16:32.159 align:start position:0%
acre and in addition the water
 
01:16:33.950 --> 01:16:33.960 align:start position:0%
restrictions the sewage restrictions
 
01:16:36.530 --> 01:16:36.540 align:start position:0%
we're saying a town can require both if
 
01:16:38.810 --> 01:16:38.820 align:start position:0%
you take out the half acre and tie it
 
01:16:40.850 --> 01:16:40.860 align:start position:0%
back to five then what you're saying is
 
01:16:43.669 --> 01:16:43.679 align:start position:0%
there's only the sewage restrictions so
 
01:16:46.010 --> 01:16:46.020 align:start position:0%
this is the more restrictive version
 
01:16:47.750 --> 01:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
right here
 
01:16:49.490 --> 01:16:49.500 align:start position:0%
um I want to go back to the original
 
01:16:52.870 --> 01:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
comment made about passion and
 
01:16:56.689 --> 01:16:56.699 align:start position:0%
the supposed definition of Civility so I
 
01:16:58.010 --> 01:16:58.020 align:start position:0%
understand that people of different
 
01:17:01.090 --> 01:17:01.100 align:start position:0%
Generations May perceive how especially
 
01:17:04.850 --> 01:17:04.860 align:start position:0%
some Sexes Express themselves as being
 
01:17:08.330 --> 01:17:08.340 align:start position:0%
maybe out of what they expect no I'm
 
01:17:10.850 --> 01:17:10.860 align:start position:0%
representing I am
 
01:17:12.530 --> 01:17:12.540 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to ask you ask you my
 
01:17:15.770 --> 01:17:15.780 align:start position:0%
point was that the original passion that
 
01:17:19.250 --> 01:17:19.260 align:start position:0%
I saw was someone a member calling this
 
01:17:22.010 --> 01:17:22.020 align:start position:0%
bill ridiculous and saying
 
01:17:24.470 --> 01:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
I I we're trying we're trying to get to
 
01:17:26.689 --> 01:17:26.699 align:start position:0%
a consensus Here Right Moving us away
 
01:17:29.090 --> 01:17:29.100 align:start position:0%
from that but my passion is with making
 
01:17:30.950 --> 01:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
sure that people are not kicked out of
 
01:17:33.110 --> 01:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
where they live kicked out of the state
 
01:17:35.030 --> 01:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
and kicked out of having housing at all
 
01:17:37.970 --> 01:17:37.980 align:start position:0%
okay so I think I do understand that and
 
01:17:40.550 --> 01:17:40.560 align:start position:0%
I understand his passion on both sides I
 
01:17:44.149 --> 01:17:44.159 align:start position:0%
or all sides I guess
 
01:17:46.130 --> 01:17:46.140 align:start position:0%
we've been at this for an hour and 15
 
01:17:50.030 --> 01:17:50.040 align:start position:0%
minutes is there a way for us to
 
01:17:53.510 --> 01:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
maybe send language to representative
 
01:17:56.090 --> 01:17:56.100 align:start position:0%
Reed that would get you to a yes on this
 
01:17:56.100 --> 01:17:57.050 align:start position:0%
Reed that would get you to a yes on this
bill

01:17:57.050 --> 01:17:57.060 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:18:00.770 --> 01:18:00.780 align:start position:0%
Crossing things out making changes
 
01:18:02.750 --> 01:18:02.760 align:start position:0%
um this
 
01:18:04.610 --> 01:18:04.620 align:start position:0%
it can't be to the entire committee it
 
01:18:06.770 --> 01:18:06.780 align:start position:0%
can be one-on-one sent
 
01:18:08.570 --> 01:18:08.580 align:start position:0%
um I guess I'm kind of wondering how the
 
01:18:09.709 --> 01:18:09.719 align:start position:0%
committee wants to move forward we have
 
01:18:11.750 --> 01:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
a couple other things to talk about
 
01:18:15.470 --> 01:18:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:19.850 --> 01:18:19.860 align:start position:0%
okay representative yokella
 
01:18:22.490 --> 01:18:22.500 align:start position:0%
um I think that
 
01:18:26.689 --> 01:18:26.699 align:start position:0%
the language obviously the language that
 
01:18:29.450 --> 01:18:29.460 align:start position:0%
we've talked about thus far and the
 
01:18:32.209 --> 01:18:32.219 align:start position:0%
changes that we've talked about thus far
 
01:18:32.219 --> 01:18:33.229 align:start position:0%
changes that we've talked about thus far
um

01:18:33.229 --> 01:18:33.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:37.070 --> 01:18:37.080 align:start position:0%
I support all of them and so I don't
 
01:18:40.330 --> 01:18:40.340 align:start position:0%
feel the need to submit anything
 
01:18:42.890 --> 01:18:42.900 align:start position:0%
necessarily to representative Reed but I
 
01:18:44.630 --> 01:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
definitely do think that there are
 
01:18:47.930 --> 01:18:47.940 align:start position:0%
things potentially within this bill that
 
01:18:51.770 --> 01:18:51.780 align:start position:0%
other members may have that we've talked
 
01:18:53.750 --> 01:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
about that may have issues with and so
 
01:18:56.930 --> 01:18:56.940 align:start position:0%
those members I think could reach out to
 
01:18:58.550 --> 01:18:58.560 align:start position:0%
representative Reed and that would
 
01:19:01.490 --> 01:19:01.500 align:start position:0%
impress upon her what I was previously
 
01:19:03.410 --> 01:19:03.420 align:start position:0%
stating as the benefit of having two
 
01:19:06.290 --> 01:19:06.300 align:start position:0%
bills and that you could get one of them
 
01:19:07.970 --> 01:19:07.980 align:start position:0%
with unanimous support and one of them
 
01:19:10.790 --> 01:19:10.800 align:start position:0%
with majority support potentially
 
01:19:11.750 --> 01:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
that's what I was thinking
 
01:19:14.870 --> 01:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
representative Reed thank you and if it
 
01:19:16.970 --> 01:19:16.980 align:start position:0%
turns out that this committee cannot get
 
01:19:18.470 --> 01:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
behind one strong bill which is what I
 
01:19:21.110 --> 01:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
said was the intent the reason I thought
 
01:19:22.669 --> 01:19:22.679 align:start position:0%
it was good to have one bill is to have
 
01:19:23.689 --> 01:19:23.699 align:start position:0%
one strong bill that the entire
 
01:19:25.550 --> 01:19:25.560 align:start position:0%
committee supported if that turns out to
 
01:19:28.070 --> 01:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
be impossible then it makes a lot more
 
01:19:30.530 --> 01:19:30.540 align:start position:0%
sense to separate it out having said
 
01:19:32.810 --> 01:19:32.820 align:start position:0%
that everything we've been through so
 
01:19:36.950 --> 01:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
far every point we seem to move on from
 
01:19:38.750 --> 01:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
without any
 
01:19:41.030 --> 01:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
um problems until we got to this very
 
01:19:43.189 --> 01:19:43.199 align:start position:0%
last sentence and the two
 
01:19:45.229 --> 01:19:45.239 align:start position:0%
recommendations I heard about this very
 
01:19:46.970 --> 01:19:46.980 align:start position:0%
lesson well there's three there was one
 
01:19:49.610 --> 01:19:49.620 align:start position:0%
saying bring it down to a like a quarter
 
01:19:51.649 --> 01:19:51.659 align:start position:0%
or a third of an acre but then the other
 
01:19:53.149 --> 01:19:53.159 align:start position:0%
that's moving in the opposite direction
 
01:19:55.250 --> 01:19:55.260 align:start position:0%
of what some of the concerns of the the
 
01:19:57.950 --> 01:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
other members are one was to get rid of
 
01:20:00.050 --> 01:20:00.060 align:start position:0%
it entirely I'm open to that the other
 
01:20:02.990 --> 01:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
one was to just get rid of or more and
 
01:20:05.870 --> 01:20:05.880 align:start position:0%
I'm open to that as well I don't think
 
01:20:08.750 --> 01:20:08.760 align:start position:0%
either one changes the overall meaning
 
01:20:10.790 --> 01:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
at all except for to get rid of
 
01:20:13.130 --> 01:20:13.140 align:start position:0%
completely half acre requirement but
 
01:20:16.070 --> 01:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
that makes it less restrictive so I if
 
01:20:18.470 --> 01:20:18.480 align:start position:0%
if the committee wants to vote on which
 
01:20:20.630 --> 01:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
version of that right now or just kind
 
01:20:24.290 --> 01:20:24.300 align:start position:0%
of unofficially vote uh straw poll which
 
01:20:26.149 --> 01:20:26.159 align:start position:0%
version I'm happy to accept whatever the
 
01:20:29.209 --> 01:20:29.219 align:start position:0%
committee says and put that in a draft
 
01:20:32.149 --> 01:20:32.159 align:start position:0%
so let me
 
01:20:35.689 --> 01:20:35.699 align:start position:0%
let me ask so I I think there is there's
 
01:20:37.370 --> 01:20:37.380 align:start position:0%
a heavy lift Bill and then there's kind
 
01:20:39.649 --> 01:20:39.659 align:start position:0%
of like a low-hanging fruit bill
 
01:20:42.350 --> 01:20:42.360 align:start position:0%
like from what I'm seeing
 
01:20:44.990 --> 01:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
um and you might you might get
 
01:20:47.450 --> 01:20:47.460 align:start position:0%
you know unanimous on one and maybe be
 
01:20:49.130 --> 01:20:49.140 align:start position:0%
half on the other
 
01:20:52.370 --> 01:20:52.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:53.630 --> 01:20:53.640 align:start position:0%
representative Walsh if I'm
 
01:20:55.610 --> 01:20:55.620 align:start position:0%
understanding you right
 
01:20:58.850 --> 01:20:58.860 align:start position:0%
if we keep it just 180u
 
01:21:01.970 --> 01:21:01.980 align:start position:0%
limit the parking language that we put
 
01:21:04.729 --> 01:21:04.739 align:start position:0%
out there and then
 
01:21:07.450 --> 01:21:07.460 align:start position:0%
attached and detached
 
01:21:10.370 --> 01:21:10.380 align:start position:0%
is in the square footage
 
01:21:12.530 --> 01:21:12.540 align:start position:0%
is that language that we talked about
 
01:21:14.810 --> 01:21:14.820 align:start position:0%
okay with you and then the second the
 
01:21:17.689 --> 01:21:17.699 align:start position:0%
other bill would be making it one to two
 
01:21:19.189 --> 01:21:19.199 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:21:21.169 --> 01:21:21.179 align:start position:0%
the second one could be required as
 
01:21:24.830 --> 01:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:26.750 --> 01:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
stuff yeah thank you Mr chair before I
 
01:21:28.550 --> 01:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
answer you I do apologize for my
 
01:21:30.530 --> 01:21:30.540 align:start position:0%
passionate comments I don't get a chance
 
01:21:33.350 --> 01:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
on Transportation too often either
 
01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:34.430 align:start position:0%
on Transportation too often either
um

01:21:34.430 --> 01:21:34.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:36.290 --> 01:21:36.300 align:start position:0%
I guess why I have a hard time with such
 
01:21:38.330 --> 01:21:38.340 align:start position:0%
uh to answer your question first yes I
 
01:21:40.430 --> 01:21:40.440 align:start position:0%
think now after this debate it would
 
01:21:42.350 --> 01:21:42.360 align:start position:0%
make sense to separate the easy from the
 
01:21:44.570 --> 01:21:44.580 align:start position:0%
difficult lists and again I think the
 
01:21:47.330 --> 01:21:47.340 align:start position:0%
easy lift is just to re you know make
 
01:21:48.770 --> 01:21:48.780 align:start position:0%
sure the municipalities are passing
 
01:21:51.050 --> 01:21:51.060 align:start position:0%
ordinance to just get around the whole
 
01:21:51.060 --> 01:21:52.130 align:start position:0%
ordinance to just get around the whole
step

01:21:52.130 --> 01:21:52.140 align:start position:0%
step
 
01:21:55.310 --> 01:21:55.320 align:start position:0%
um get around the whole statute
 
01:21:57.410 --> 01:21:57.420 align:start position:0%
um but I guess I just in general in
 
01:21:59.870 --> 01:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
terms of why I may have a passion for
 
01:22:03.830 --> 01:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
this I I just I don't look at the local
 
01:22:05.870 --> 01:22:05.880 align:start position:0%
planning boards and zoning boards as
 
01:22:07.970 --> 01:22:07.980 align:start position:0%
being always nefarious for the reasons
 
01:22:10.669 --> 01:22:10.679 align:start position:0%
they do things uh and so when I see us
 
01:22:12.470 --> 01:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
trying to push back on that there's all
 
01:22:14.870 --> 01:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
we don't know the situations on anything
 
01:22:17.870 --> 01:22:17.880 align:start position:0%
that goes on and we're still trying to
 
01:22:19.850 --> 01:22:19.860 align:start position:0%
Edge away a little more of the
 
01:22:21.169 --> 01:22:21.179 align:start position:0%
decision-making of the people that
 
01:22:23.090 --> 01:22:23.100 align:start position:0%
actually live there that's why I have
 
01:22:25.130 --> 01:22:25.140 align:start position:0%
the passion I do about these discussions
 
01:22:27.229 --> 01:22:27.239 align:start position:0%
But to answer your question we should
 
01:22:30.709 --> 01:22:30.719 align:start position:0%
separate if so to clarify if we separate
 
01:22:34.010 --> 01:22:34.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:35.330 --> 01:22:35.340 align:start position:0%
just now
 
01:22:37.610 --> 01:22:37.620 align:start position:0%
is that something where if I mean
 
01:22:38.810 --> 01:22:38.820 align:start position:0%
obviously you have to see language but
 
01:22:41.030 --> 01:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
if we split it up from expanding it from
 
01:22:42.470 --> 01:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
one to two and adding a Workforce
 
01:22:43.910 --> 01:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
housing that would be like a different
 
01:22:46.610 --> 01:22:46.620 align:start position:0%
bill and the other one would be attached
 
01:22:50.149 --> 01:22:50.159 align:start position:0%
detached parking clarifications and then
 
01:22:50.159 --> 01:22:50.810 align:start position:0%
detached parking clarifications and then
um

01:22:50.810 --> 01:22:50.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:54.169 --> 01:22:54.179 align:start position:0%
square foot requirements
 
01:22:55.669 --> 01:22:55.679 align:start position:0%
I'd like to see the language but I think
 
01:22:57.290 --> 01:22:57.300 align:start position:0%
that's a direction to go that would be
 
01:22:59.510 --> 01:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
more productive okay so the other one I
 
01:23:01.370 --> 01:23:01.380 align:start position:0%
have a fear of the setbacks too
 
01:23:04.010 --> 01:23:04.020 align:start position:0%
but again that's all in that same that
 
01:23:06.229 --> 01:23:06.239 align:start position:0%
first bill that easier lift Bill okay so
 
01:23:08.450 --> 01:23:08.460 align:start position:0%
we have flexibility we have time on this
 
01:23:08.460 --> 01:23:09.410 align:start position:0%
we have flexibility we have time on this
so

01:23:09.410 --> 01:23:09.420 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:23:10.850 --> 01:23:10.860 align:start position:0%
um what I'm going to ask representative
 
01:23:13.250 --> 01:23:13.260 align:start position:0%
Reed I know this is not obviously what
 
01:23:14.930 --> 01:23:14.940 align:start position:0%
you want I mean I
 
01:23:18.110 --> 01:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
personally am in favor of both but
 
01:23:21.050 --> 01:23:21.060 align:start position:0%
I want to get a consensus from everybody
 
01:23:23.990 --> 01:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
on lease one so can you work on this and
 
01:23:25.370 --> 01:23:25.380 align:start position:0%
then send us language for two different
 
01:23:28.910 --> 01:23:28.920 align:start position:0%
bills with the uh chairs blessing I will
 
01:23:33.830 --> 01:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
prepare both separate uh bills as well
 
01:23:36.169 --> 01:23:36.179 align:start position:0%
as one combined bill in case we can get
 
01:23:38.149 --> 01:23:38.159 align:start position:0%
to consensus on the combined because I
 
01:23:40.970 --> 01:23:40.980 align:start position:0%
do fear very much that despite the
 
01:23:43.130 --> 01:23:43.140 align:start position:0%
increase to two adus having broad
 
01:23:45.950 --> 01:23:45.960 align:start position:0%
support across both parties and across
 
01:23:47.470 --> 01:23:47.480 align:start position:0%
multiple organizations
 
01:23:51.050 --> 01:23:51.060 align:start position:0%
that if we separate it out separately we
 
01:23:52.970 --> 01:23:52.980 align:start position:0%
are shooting it in the foot so I would
 
01:23:56.090 --> 01:23:56.100 align:start position:0%
like to propose or prepare three
 
01:23:58.850 --> 01:23:58.860 align:start position:0%
different bills okay and there have been
 
01:24:00.530 --> 01:24:00.540 align:start position:0%
a lot of edits to the one that we have
 
01:24:02.090 --> 01:24:02.100 align:start position:0%
here today so I'd like to see that
 
01:24:03.830 --> 01:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
language too I have all of that
 
01:24:05.330 --> 01:24:05.340 align:start position:0%
um I just still have the question of
 
01:24:07.310 --> 01:24:07.320 align:start position:0%
what people want me to do with the last
 
01:24:09.530 --> 01:24:09.540 align:start position:0%
sentence here
 
01:24:12.649 --> 01:24:12.659 align:start position:0%
is it is it fine the way it is or would
 
01:24:18.050 --> 01:24:18.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:20.149 --> 01:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
representative Damon
 
01:24:23.450 --> 01:24:23.460 align:start position:0%
so if we strike that last statement
 
01:24:23.460 --> 01:24:25.669 align:start position:0%
so if we strike that last statement
entirely

01:24:25.669 --> 01:24:25.679 align:start position:0%
entirely
 
01:24:27.530 --> 01:24:27.540 align:start position:0%
then that
 
01:24:30.950 --> 01:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't change existing law
 
01:24:33.530 --> 01:24:33.540 align:start position:0%
in any municipality so they in fact
 
01:24:35.689 --> 01:24:35.699 align:start position:0%
could correct me if I'm wrong here could
 
01:24:38.030 --> 01:24:38.040 align:start position:0%
still have a minimum lot size
 
01:24:41.870 --> 01:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
no representative yeah go ahead
 
01:24:44.149 --> 01:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
yep so thank you
 
01:24:46.910 --> 01:24:46.920 align:start position:0%
um so right now we're only allowing them
 
01:24:50.630 --> 01:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
to do certain certain types of uh
 
01:24:52.610 --> 01:24:52.620 align:start position:0%
restrictions on Accessory dwelling units
 
01:24:54.950 --> 01:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
which it includes like setbacks and
 
01:24:57.229 --> 01:24:57.239 align:start position:0%
aesthetic and design review and stuff
 
01:25:00.350 --> 01:25:00.360 align:start position:0%
like that and and Frontage but we're not
 
01:25:05.149 --> 01:25:05.159 align:start position:0%
allowing them to set size requirements
 
01:25:08.510 --> 01:25:08.520 align:start position:0%
um for those adus so the first Adu could
 
01:25:11.209 --> 01:25:11.219 align:start position:0%
be added as long as there was space
 
01:25:14.689 --> 01:25:14.699 align:start position:0%
right now there this this language is
 
01:25:16.390 --> 01:25:16.400 align:start position:0%
essentially trying to
 
01:25:19.669 --> 01:25:19.679 align:start position:0%
empower the municipality that if there
 
01:25:22.189 --> 01:25:22.199 align:start position:0%
was going to be two that they could set
 
01:25:25.370 --> 01:25:25.380 align:start position:0%
a minimum floor for that lot requirement
 
01:25:27.410 --> 01:25:27.420 align:start position:0%
whereas right now they're not they're
 
01:25:28.910 --> 01:25:28.920 align:start position:0%
not able to do that
 
01:25:28.920 --> 01:25:33.550 align:start position:0%
not able to do that
is

01:25:33.550 --> 01:25:33.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:36.709 --> 01:25:36.719 align:start position:0%
prohibits a municipality from putting a
 
01:25:40.130 --> 01:25:40.140 align:start position:0%
minimum lot size on RSA on paid to use
 
01:25:43.550 --> 01:25:43.560 align:start position:0%
go ahead represent no but currently the
 
01:25:46.250 --> 01:25:46.260 align:start position:0%
1ad Allowed by right is allowed by right
 
01:25:49.070 --> 01:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
without any additional requirements so
 
01:25:51.410 --> 01:25:51.420 align:start position:0%
that I mean and it's actually referenced
 
01:25:54.590 --> 01:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
earlier yes
 
01:25:58.550 --> 01:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
uh 19 through 21 yeah um on page one
 
01:26:02.810 --> 01:26:02.820 align:start position:0%
okay no additional requirements so by me
 
01:26:04.790 --> 01:26:04.800 align:start position:0%
inserting this I was doing what I
 
01:26:06.709 --> 01:26:06.719 align:start position:0%
thought the quote-unquote nimbies or the
 
01:26:08.689 --> 01:26:08.699 align:start position:0%
municipal Association would like which
 
01:26:10.669 --> 01:26:10.679 align:start position:0%
is to say okay we're not just allowing a
 
01:26:12.169 --> 01:26:12.179 align:start position:0%
free-for-all you know if you're on an
 
01:26:14.209 --> 01:26:14.219 align:start position:0%
eighth of an acre you have to have at
 
01:26:16.070 --> 01:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
least a half an acre to have a second
 
01:26:20.090 --> 01:26:20.100 align:start position:0%
Adu so if we strike it and just revert
 
01:26:23.090 --> 01:26:23.100 align:start position:0%
it back to section five with just only
 
01:26:26.810 --> 01:26:26.820 align:start position:0%
the sewage that is less restrictive if
 
01:26:28.370 --> 01:26:28.380 align:start position:0%
you want more restrictions than you
 
01:26:30.470 --> 01:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
leave it in the or more is a
 
01:26:32.090 --> 01:26:32.100 align:start position:0%
technicality because
 
01:26:34.669 --> 01:26:34.679 align:start position:0%
towns can allow more if they want and
 
01:26:37.370 --> 01:26:37.380 align:start position:0%
that goes throughout the current RSA the
 
01:26:39.709 --> 01:26:39.719 align:start position:0%
or more language but if people are
 
01:26:41.270 --> 01:26:41.280 align:start position:0%
feeling very strongly about getting rid
 
01:26:43.129 --> 01:26:43.139 align:start position:0%
of or more because it just freaks them
 
01:26:44.990 --> 01:26:45.000 align:start position:0%
out then I'm happy to get rid of it Nate
 
01:26:46.370 --> 01:26:46.380 align:start position:0%
Nate would you be able to weigh in on
 
01:26:48.350 --> 01:26:48.360 align:start position:0%
this for us and I'm hoping to move on
 
01:26:49.669 --> 01:26:49.679 align:start position:0%
from this so we can talk about a couple
 
01:26:51.410 --> 01:26:51.420 align:start position:0%
other things and have the rest of our
 
01:26:51.420 --> 01:26:57.530 align:start position:0%
other things and have the rest of our
afternoon

01:26:57.530 --> 01:26:57.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:59.689 --> 01:26:59.699 align:start position:0%
Mr chair as you as you'd like to move on
 
01:27:02.810 --> 01:27:02.820 align:start position:0%
I'm certainly well happy to to work with
 
01:27:04.970 --> 01:27:04.980 align:start position:0%
representative Reed to uh to work on
 
01:27:06.950 --> 01:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
this language
 
01:27:06.960 --> 01:27:07.790 align:start position:0%
this language
um

01:27:07.790 --> 01:27:07.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:11.629 --> 01:27:11.639 align:start position:0%
as I understand it the intent here in
 
01:27:16.310 --> 01:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
this I guess newly revised um 674-73
 
01:27:18.530 --> 01:27:18.540 align:start position:0%
lines 10 through 15.
 
01:27:22.270 --> 01:27:22.280 align:start position:0%
is to clarify that
 
01:27:27.530 --> 01:27:27.540 align:start position:0%
one of the accessory dwelling units is
 
01:27:27.540 --> 01:27:28.189 align:start position:0%
one of the accessory dwelling units is
um

01:27:28.189 --> 01:27:28.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:31.970 --> 01:27:31.980 align:start position:0%
allowed to be detached by right and then
 
01:27:34.850 --> 01:27:34.860 align:start position:0%
the other one could either be attached
 
01:27:38.330 --> 01:27:38.340 align:start position:0%
or detached and
 
01:27:40.250 --> 01:27:40.260 align:start position:0%
obviously the the municipality could
 
01:27:43.430 --> 01:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
allow more than two units
 
01:27:45.530 --> 01:27:45.540 align:start position:0%
um and as part of that
 
01:27:49.250 --> 01:27:49.260 align:start position:0%
I think the intent is to ensure that
 
01:27:51.110 --> 01:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
there's adequate
 
01:27:51.120 --> 01:27:52.430 align:start position:0%
there's adequate
um

01:27:52.430 --> 01:27:52.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:54.950 --> 01:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
lot size to accommodate things like
 
01:27:58.550 --> 01:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
septic sewer Wells
 
01:27:58.560 --> 01:27:59.750 align:start position:0%
septic sewer Wells
Etc

01:27:59.750 --> 01:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
01:27:59.760 --> 01:28:00.709 align:start position:0%
Etc
um

01:28:00.709 --> 01:28:00.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:02.870 --> 01:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
based in the committee's conversations
 
01:28:04.430 --> 01:28:04.440 align:start position:0%
it appears there needs to be a little
 
01:28:06.290 --> 01:28:06.300 align:start position:0%
bit more tweaking of this language I'm
 
01:28:07.490 --> 01:28:07.500 align:start position:0%
happy to work on that but I don't have
 
01:28:10.610 --> 01:28:10.620 align:start position:0%
any language at the moment okay
 
01:28:12.649 --> 01:28:12.659 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
01:28:14.750 --> 01:28:14.760 align:start position:0%
representative Damon
 
01:28:16.790 --> 01:28:16.800 align:start position:0%
so as a new rep here I just have a
 
01:28:18.169 --> 01:28:18.179 align:start position:0%
process question
 
01:28:20.870 --> 01:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
what is permitted
 
01:28:24.070 --> 01:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
for conversations outside committee
 
01:28:26.510 --> 01:28:26.520 align:start position:0%
for example if I want to have an
 
01:28:28.370 --> 01:28:28.380 align:start position:0%
individual conversations with various
 
01:28:29.870 --> 01:28:29.880 align:start position:0%
different members of the committee
 
01:28:32.689 --> 01:28:32.699 align:start position:0%
that's a lot but then
 
01:28:35.810 --> 01:28:35.820 align:start position:0%
the conversation with party a may come
 
01:28:38.330 --> 01:28:38.340 align:start position:0%
up in the conversation with party B so
 
01:28:41.149 --> 01:28:41.159 align:start position:0%
that's all fine
 
01:28:43.070 --> 01:28:43.080 align:start position:0%
so we can bounce things back and forth
 
01:28:44.870 --> 01:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
and we can do it by email as well as
 
01:28:47.090 --> 01:28:47.100 align:start position:0%
whatever else okay I just wanted to be
 
01:28:49.850 --> 01:28:49.860 align:start position:0%
sure I wasn't violating if I form a
 
01:28:52.129 --> 01:28:52.139 align:start position:0%
subcommittee on this it would have to be
 
01:28:54.410 --> 01:28:54.420 align:start position:0%
noticed and but if if if you want to
 
01:28:55.850 --> 01:28:55.860 align:start position:0%
work on some part of specific language
 
01:28:57.830 --> 01:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
representative read or any member of the
 
01:28:59.930 --> 01:28:59.940 align:start position:0%
committee or certainly not to do and it
 
01:29:03.410 --> 01:29:03.420 align:start position:0%
just to add on to that if you have a
 
01:29:05.629 --> 01:29:05.639 align:start position:0%
meeting of your any meeting you have
 
01:29:08.870 --> 01:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
zoom or otherwise with more than half a
 
01:29:11.390 --> 01:29:11.400 align:start position:0%
half or more of the committee would
 
01:29:14.450 --> 01:29:14.460 align:start position:0%
require a notice by 91a but less than
 
01:29:18.229 --> 01:29:18.239 align:start position:0%
half is fine okay yeah so I am hoping
 
01:29:20.870 --> 01:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping to move on from this do we
 
01:29:22.910 --> 01:29:22.920 align:start position:0%
have action items on this representative
 
01:29:25.129 --> 01:29:25.139 align:start position:0%
you can have it okay
 
01:29:27.649 --> 01:29:27.659 align:start position:0%
I'm going to prepare three different uh
 
01:29:31.430 --> 01:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
bills one two of them are separated from
 
01:29:33.050 --> 01:29:33.060 align:start position:0%
this and one will be a combined based on
 
01:29:34.189 --> 01:29:34.199 align:start position:0%
the notes that we've talked about today
 
01:29:34.199 --> 01:29:35.030 align:start position:0%
the notes that we've talked about today
okay

01:29:35.030 --> 01:29:35.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:29:36.229 --> 01:29:36.239 align:start position:0%
okay so I'm going to move on for number
 
01:29:37.669 --> 01:29:37.679 align:start position:0%
two I'm gonna go to number three on
 
01:29:39.050 --> 01:29:39.060 align:start position:0%
Demar Department of Environmental
 
01:29:39.060 --> 01:29:40.610 align:start position:0%
Demar Department of Environmental
Services

01:29:40.610 --> 01:29:40.620 align:start position:0%
Services
 
01:29:43.250 --> 01:29:43.260 align:start position:0%
um I don't I'm sorry
 
01:29:45.709 --> 01:29:45.719 align:start position:0%
okay um I am hoping that representative
 
01:29:46.970 --> 01:29:46.980 align:start position:0%
McConkey would be willing to put
 
01:29:49.129 --> 01:29:49.139 align:start position:0%
together some language on this stuff and
 
01:29:50.810 --> 01:29:50.820 align:start position:0%
we don't need a specific subcommittee on
 
01:29:50.820 --> 01:29:53.209 align:start position:0%
we don't need a specific subcommittee on
that

01:29:53.209 --> 01:29:53.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:55.669 --> 01:29:55.679 align:start position:0%
that's fine Mr chairman I think that's
 
01:29:57.709 --> 01:29:57.719 align:start position:0%
pretty straightforward yeah and I
 
01:29:59.750 --> 01:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
actually we were doing some research
 
01:29:59.760 --> 01:30:00.709 align:start position:0%
actually we were doing some research
about

01:30:00.709 --> 01:30:00.719 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:30:03.830 --> 01:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
um it's gallons per day usage and we're
 
01:30:05.810 --> 01:30:05.820 align:start position:0%
the highest in New England I like a lot
 
01:30:08.450 --> 01:30:08.460 align:start position:0%
so I kind of want to see like
 
01:30:10.610 --> 01:30:10.620 align:start position:0%
is it it's it's through a rule making
 
01:30:13.010 --> 01:30:13.020 align:start position:0%
process but I kind of want to see like a
 
01:30:14.990 --> 01:30:15.000 align:start position:0%
way to update the legislature and you
 
01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:15.649 align:start position:0%
way to update the legislature and you
know

01:30:15.649 --> 01:30:15.659 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:30:15.659 --> 01:30:17.149 align:start position:0%
know
identify

01:30:17.149 --> 01:30:17.159 align:start position:0%
identify
 
01:30:18.709 --> 01:30:18.719 align:start position:0%
what rules have been in place for a
 
01:30:20.450 --> 01:30:20.460 align:start position:0%
while that could be lack like lacks
 
01:30:22.370 --> 01:30:22.380 align:start position:0%
things things like that lacked up to the
 
01:30:22.380 --> 01:30:24.950 align:start position:0%
things things like that lacked up to the
legislature

01:30:24.950 --> 01:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:24.960 --> 01:30:25.729 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:30:25.729 --> 01:30:25.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:25.739 --> 01:30:28.010 align:start position:0%
um
representative

01:30:28.010 --> 01:30:28.020 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:30:31.550 --> 01:30:31.560 align:start position:0%
thank you um Ari
 
01:30:35.090 --> 01:30:35.100 align:start position:0%
are I mean I definitely I guess I would
 
01:30:37.209 --> 01:30:37.219 align:start position:0%
like to
 
01:30:40.070 --> 01:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
uh kind of get a sense of where we're
 
01:30:42.649 --> 01:30:42.659 align:start position:0%
headed with the Environmental Services
 
01:30:44.510 --> 01:30:44.520 align:start position:0%
thing because the way you described it
 
01:30:46.850 --> 01:30:46.860 align:start position:0%
with 150 gallons I think that it should
 
01:30:49.129 --> 01:30:49.139 align:start position:0%
be changed I wouldn't
 
01:30:53.090 --> 01:30:53.100 align:start position:0%
like I don't care to get a report from
 
01:30:56.750 --> 01:30:56.760 align:start position:0%
Des about we've had it for 30 years or
 
01:30:58.430 --> 01:30:58.440 align:start position:0%
10 years or in two years it doesn't
 
01:31:00.050 --> 01:31:00.060 align:start position:0%
really matter to me I think it should
 
01:31:02.330 --> 01:31:02.340 align:start position:0%
just be changed and so
 
01:31:02.340 --> 01:31:03.430 align:start position:0%
just be changed and so
um

01:31:03.430 --> 01:31:03.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:08.149 --> 01:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
the so I guess the wording that you said
 
01:31:10.370 --> 01:31:10.380 align:start position:0%
it seemed like give me an update of like
 
01:31:12.350 --> 01:31:12.360 align:start position:0%
how often this has changed or whatever
 
01:31:14.510 --> 01:31:14.520 align:start position:0%
and I'm going in a different direction
 
01:31:18.290 --> 01:31:18.300 align:start position:0%
with that and so I guess where where
 
01:31:20.810 --> 01:31:20.820 align:start position:0%
we're where's the committee I guess
 
01:31:22.610 --> 01:31:22.620 align:start position:0%
planning I think I was splitting hairs I
 
01:31:24.110 --> 01:31:24.120 align:start position:0%
think representative cocky kind of gets
 
01:31:26.090 --> 01:31:26.100 align:start position:0%
a an idea of the direction that we want
 
01:31:28.010 --> 01:31:28.020 align:start position:0%
to head with this stuff so I'm gonna let
 
01:31:30.229 --> 01:31:30.239 align:start position:0%
him put together a language and then
 
01:31:32.450 --> 01:31:32.460 align:start position:0%
um present it at our meeting at the end
 
01:31:32.460 --> 01:31:33.830 align:start position:0%
um present it at our meeting at the end
of

01:31:33.830 --> 01:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:31:35.390 --> 01:31:35.400 align:start position:0%
um August first week of September on
 
01:31:37.310 --> 01:31:37.320 align:start position:0%
what you came up with and if there needs
 
01:31:39.290 --> 01:31:39.300 align:start position:0%
to be tweaks we can do it then
 
01:31:41.570 --> 01:31:41.580 align:start position:0%
um so I want to go back to number two
 
01:31:42.950 --> 01:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
um appeals of unfavorable board
 
01:31:44.990 --> 01:31:45.000 align:start position:0%
decisions so we talked a little bit
 
01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:46.189 align:start position:0%
decisions so we talked a little bit
about

01:31:46.189 --> 01:31:46.199 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:31:50.090 --> 01:31:50.100 align:start position:0%
expanding the hab but further clarifying
 
01:31:52.010 --> 01:31:52.020 align:start position:0%
um appeals that can be made to the hab
 
01:31:52.020 --> 01:31:54.470 align:start position:0%
um appeals that can be made to the hab
so

01:31:54.470 --> 01:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:31:56.930 --> 01:31:56.940 align:start position:0%
we want to add all these other like if
 
01:31:58.669 --> 01:31:58.679 align:start position:0%
if there's an unfavorable decision by
 
01:31:59.629 --> 01:31:59.639 align:start position:0%
the fire department Health Department
 
01:32:02.810 --> 01:32:02.820 align:start position:0%
State Fire Marshal obviously zoning
 
01:32:04.790 --> 01:32:04.800 align:start position:0%
um Heritage commission a dangerous
 
01:32:06.950 --> 01:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
species any of those things that those
 
01:32:08.990 --> 01:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
suits or appeals can be done through the
 
01:32:11.450 --> 01:32:11.460 align:start position:0%
hab so I have um Catherine Kerry Fox
 
01:32:13.370 --> 01:32:13.380 align:start position:0%
here at least can you come up and
 
01:32:15.290 --> 01:32:15.300 align:start position:0%
explain the language currently in the
 
01:32:18.770 --> 01:32:18.780 align:start position:0%
hab and you say it's not necessarily
 
01:32:21.350 --> 01:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
needed to clarify this language but
 
01:32:23.629 --> 01:32:23.639 align:start position:0%
um could you give us kind of a direction
 
01:32:26.330 --> 01:32:26.340 align:start position:0%
for this committee please
 
01:32:28.189 --> 01:32:28.199 align:start position:0%
this is one of the issues that we
 
01:32:30.290 --> 01:32:30.300 align:start position:0%
identified as a problem where people are
 
01:32:31.970 --> 01:32:31.980 align:start position:0%
receiving unfavorable decisions from
 
01:32:31.980 --> 01:32:33.129 align:start position:0%
receiving unfavorable decisions from
local

01:32:33.129 --> 01:32:33.139 align:start position:0%
local
 
01:32:35.209 --> 01:32:35.219 align:start position:0%
officials and we want to make sure that
 
01:32:37.669 --> 01:32:37.679 align:start position:0%
they have an Avenue to appeal that I'm
 
01:32:40.370 --> 01:32:40.380 align:start position:0%
happy to assist if I can so good morning
 
01:32:42.590 --> 01:32:42.600 align:start position:0%
I guess Kathy Corey Fox and I am with
 
01:32:44.810 --> 01:32:44.820 align:start position:0%
the Bernstein Shore group I work with
 
01:32:46.430 --> 01:32:46.440 align:start position:0%
one of the attorneys who was the former
 
01:32:48.530 --> 01:32:48.540 align:start position:0%
chair of the housing appeals board and
 
01:32:50.270 --> 01:32:50.280 align:start position:0%
when I heard previous discussions on
 
01:32:52.189 --> 01:32:52.199 align:start position:0%
their duties and such I reached out to
 
01:32:53.870 --> 01:32:53.880 align:start position:0%
Greg Michaels
 
01:32:58.070 --> 01:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
and he shared with me it's RSA 679 and
 
01:33:01.070 --> 01:33:01.080 align:start position:0%
uh 679 colon five spells out the duties
 
01:33:03.169 --> 01:33:03.179 align:start position:0%
of the housing appeals board
 
01:33:05.330 --> 01:33:05.340 align:start position:0%
and I think at that time at your meeting
 
01:33:07.550 --> 01:33:07.560 align:start position:0%
a few weeks ago some of the concerns
 
01:33:10.370 --> 01:33:10.380 align:start position:0%
were raised he it was his opinion that
 
01:33:13.129 --> 01:33:13.139 align:start position:0%
the housing appeals board could hear
 
01:33:15.050 --> 01:33:15.060 align:start position:0%
um such cases
 
01:33:17.990 --> 01:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
the question did come up about I think
 
01:33:20.030 --> 01:33:20.040 align:start position:0%
you would ask about this state fine
 
01:33:22.370 --> 01:33:22.380 align:start position:0%
martial nose codes and he was kind of
 
01:33:24.410 --> 01:33:24.420 align:start position:0%
questionable about that his comment to
 
01:33:26.330 --> 01:33:26.340 align:start position:0%
me if it was part of the overall plan
 
01:33:28.910 --> 01:33:28.920 align:start position:0%
possibly but again it would be have to
 
01:33:31.490 --> 01:33:31.500 align:start position:0%
look at case per case
 
01:33:35.030 --> 01:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
so my my request is that
 
01:33:37.610 --> 01:33:37.620 align:start position:0%
um could you send us maybe some language
 
01:33:39.590 --> 01:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
or something that he was working on that
 
01:33:41.570 --> 01:33:41.580 align:start position:0%
he was out of town and he said he would
 
01:33:43.070 --> 01:33:43.080 align:start position:0%
get me that and I haven't I will follow
 
01:33:46.149 --> 01:33:46.159 align:start position:0%
up with him absolutely to present you
 
01:33:48.590 --> 01:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
that would be great because I I want to
 
01:33:50.629 --> 01:33:50.639 align:start position:0%
make sure that um we clarify with the
 
01:33:52.550 --> 01:33:52.560 align:start position:0%
hab and then I believe was there the
 
01:33:54.950 --> 01:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
land you stalk it passed as well right
 
01:33:57.169 --> 01:33:57.179 align:start position:0%
that is correct so I think we would also
 
01:33:58.850 --> 01:33:58.860 align:start position:0%
want to clarify it with the land you
 
01:34:00.530 --> 01:34:00.540 align:start position:0%
stock it which kind of is another
 
01:34:02.629 --> 01:34:02.639 align:start position:0%
mirrors the have in another it's another
 
01:34:04.189 --> 01:34:04.199 align:start position:0%
Avenue right of course it is and I'm
 
01:34:06.110 --> 01:34:06.120 align:start position:0%
sure representative Lynn would be more
 
01:34:08.030 --> 01:34:08.040 align:start position:0%
of a resource for that with the what he
 
01:34:10.970 --> 01:34:10.980 align:start position:0%
envisions so happy to do some awesome
 
01:34:13.669 --> 01:34:13.679 align:start position:0%
okay anything else on this actually item
 
01:34:16.930 --> 01:34:16.940 align:start position:0%
good there okay um representative
 
01:34:21.950 --> 01:34:21.960 align:start position:0%
is the point so it seemed to me that
 
01:34:21.960 --> 01:34:22.669 align:start position:0%
is the point so it seemed to me that
um

01:34:22.669 --> 01:34:22.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:25.430 --> 01:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
there was a representative
 
01:34:27.490 --> 01:34:27.500 align:start position:0%
um that was most
 
01:34:31.189 --> 01:34:31.199 align:start position:0%
uh impassioned about this and
 
01:34:32.870 --> 01:34:32.880 align:start position:0%
um maybe should be the point person are
 
01:34:34.729 --> 01:34:34.739 align:start position:0%
you planning on on putting a point
 
01:34:37.870 --> 01:34:37.880 align:start position:0%
person as far as like the person to be
 
01:34:40.250 --> 01:34:40.260 align:start position:0%
drafting legislation on this or are you
 
01:34:41.990 --> 01:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
planning on taking that on yourself or
 
01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:43.310 align:start position:0%
planning on taking that on yourself or
what

01:34:43.310 --> 01:34:43.320 align:start position:0%

01:34:49.790 --> 01:34:49.800 align:start position:0%
that on and present it to the committee
 
01:34:51.410 --> 01:34:51.420 align:start position:0%

we talked a little bit about
 
01:35:50.520 --> 01:35:52.910 align:start position:0%
we talked a little bit about
um how

01:35:52.910 --> 01:35:52.920 align:start position:0%
um how
 
01:35:56.689 --> 01:35:56.699 align:start position:0%
well a lot about how uh
 
01:36:00.290 --> 01:36:00.300 align:start position:0%
like restrictions and how how we could
 
01:36:02.689 --> 01:36:02.699 align:start position:0%
um help incentivize I
 
01:36:05.510 --> 01:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
um the streamlining of processes and and
 
01:36:07.370 --> 01:36:07.380 align:start position:0%
how we can
 
01:36:07.380 --> 01:36:08.689 align:start position:0%
how we can
um

01:36:08.689 --> 01:36:08.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:11.870 --> 01:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
affect I guess municipal
 
01:36:16.189 --> 01:36:16.199 align:start position:0%
um ins inspections and or make things go
 
01:36:18.950 --> 01:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
more smoothly and quickly
 
01:36:22.189 --> 01:36:22.199 align:start position:0%
um the idea that one of the ideas that
 
01:36:25.430 --> 01:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
I'm working on or have been asked the
 
01:36:27.470 --> 01:36:27.480 align:start position:0%
researcher not not the committee
 
01:36:29.330 --> 01:36:29.340 align:start position:0%
researcher but the actual like OLS
 
01:36:31.669 --> 01:36:31.679 align:start position:0%
researchers is to find
 
01:36:34.970 --> 01:36:34.980 align:start position:0%
um how Seattle did their um
 
01:36:39.350 --> 01:36:39.360 align:start position:0%
did their accepting of plans and
 
01:36:41.990 --> 01:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
approving of plans like regionally or or
 
01:36:44.149 --> 01:36:44.159 align:start position:0%
at the state level
 
01:36:47.510 --> 01:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
um and so I have have already asked
 
01:36:49.370 --> 01:36:49.380 align:start position:0%
about that
 
01:36:52.610 --> 01:36:52.620 align:start position:0%
um and was planning on
 
01:36:54.709 --> 01:36:54.719 align:start position:0%
um trying to get some language for it
 
01:36:57.709 --> 01:36:57.719 align:start position:0%
for the committee on that
 
01:37:01.550 --> 01:37:01.560 align:start position:0%
um they gave me information that was
 
01:37:02.629 --> 01:37:02.639 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
01:37:04.729 --> 01:37:04.739 align:start position:0%
off to the side of that not exactly what
 
01:37:07.310 --> 01:37:07.320 align:start position:0%
I was looking for and so I don't have
 
01:37:09.709 --> 01:37:09.719 align:start position:0%
that for you guys today all I have is
 
01:37:12.530 --> 01:37:12.540 align:start position:0%
this other Amendment which is is
 
01:37:12.540 --> 01:37:13.310 align:start position:0%
this other Amendment which is is
um

01:37:13.310 --> 01:37:13.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:16.870 --> 01:37:16.880 align:start position:0%
trying to help
 
01:37:20.750 --> 01:37:20.760 align:start position:0%
allow more municipality or to to have
 
01:37:24.350 --> 01:37:24.360 align:start position:0%
kind of the effect of uh
 
01:37:26.689 --> 01:37:26.699 align:start position:0%
um allowing more
 
01:37:29.930 --> 01:37:29.940 align:start position:0%
encouraging municipalities to improve
 
01:37:31.490 --> 01:37:31.500 align:start position:0%
their processes
 
01:37:35.090 --> 01:37:35.100 align:start position:0%
um or improve their regulations to be
 
01:37:36.610 --> 01:37:36.620 align:start position:0%
um more
 
01:37:39.970 --> 01:37:39.980 align:start position:0%
accepting of you know
 
01:37:43.430 --> 01:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
smaller lot sizes and smaller structures
 
01:37:47.990 --> 01:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
without going down the road of that um
 
01:37:50.390 --> 01:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
that some on this committee oppose which
 
01:37:52.910 --> 01:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
is mandating it from the state level and
 
01:37:56.350 --> 01:37:56.360 align:start position:0%
this this amendment
 
01:37:59.990 --> 01:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
to HB 313 that I've I've drafted of two
 
01:38:02.390 --> 01:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
two three five H
 
01:38:07.189 --> 01:38:07.199 align:start position:0%
um is essentially incentivizing them by
 
01:38:08.990 --> 01:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
tying it to the housing appeals board
 
01:38:10.910 --> 01:38:10.920 align:start position:0%
which or not the housing housing
 
01:38:13.790 --> 01:38:13.800 align:start position:0%
Champion designation which we just
 
01:38:15.770 --> 01:38:15.780 align:start position:0%
um created inside of the budget and
 
01:38:18.110 --> 01:38:18.120 align:start position:0%
saying that if you need if you want to
 
01:38:19.850 --> 01:38:19.860 align:start position:0%
become a housing champion and get the
 
01:38:22.729 --> 01:38:22.739 align:start position:0%
money that might come with that
 
01:38:25.189 --> 01:38:25.199 align:start position:0%
then you would need to
 
01:38:27.590 --> 01:38:27.600 align:start position:0%
um have not unreasonable lot size
 
01:38:31.310 --> 01:38:31.320 align:start position:0%
requirements and or actually very very
 
01:38:31.320 --> 01:38:31.850 align:start position:0%
requirements and or actually very very
um

01:38:31.850 --> 01:38:31.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:34.790 --> 01:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
good lot size requirements for housing
 
01:38:37.729 --> 01:38:37.739 align:start position:0%
and um and then municipality shall not
 
01:38:40.129 --> 01:38:40.139 align:start position:0%
require minimum sizes for structures now
 
01:38:41.750 --> 01:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
that we have this new
 
01:38:45.189 --> 01:38:45.199 align:start position:0%
um small uh
 
01:38:47.810 --> 01:38:47.820 align:start position:0%
small structure
 
01:38:52.189 --> 01:38:52.199 align:start position:0%
um uh zoning or not uh building code and
 
01:38:54.770 --> 01:38:54.780 align:start position:0%
so that would not this would not be a
 
01:38:56.570 --> 01:38:56.580 align:start position:0%
mandate it would just be if they wanted
 
01:38:58.550 --> 01:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
to become be considered for the housing
 
01:39:00.050 --> 01:39:00.060 align:start position:0%
Champion they would need to do this and
 
01:39:02.689 --> 01:39:02.699 align:start position:0%
so I felt like this was
 
01:39:05.450 --> 01:39:05.460 align:start position:0%
um kind of a way to
 
01:39:08.750 --> 01:39:08.760 align:start position:0%
encourage them uh okay without doing the
 
01:39:11.870 --> 01:39:11.880 align:start position:0%
Mandate so so let me yeah to there's a
 
01:39:13.669 --> 01:39:13.679 align:start position:0%
housing Champion designation that has
 
01:39:15.709 --> 01:39:15.719 align:start position:0%
been created through the budget
 
01:39:17.629 --> 01:39:17.639 align:start position:0%
um currently the rulemaking process to
 
01:39:20.090 --> 01:39:20.100 align:start position:0%
be a housing Champion is up to
 
01:39:24.410 --> 01:39:24.420 align:start position:0%
um which office of is Bea yeah yeah Bea
 
01:39:26.930 --> 01:39:26.940 align:start position:0%
so this this amendment would just
 
01:39:30.530 --> 01:39:30.540 align:start position:0%
clarify some of the rules that are the
 
01:39:31.729 --> 01:39:31.739 align:start position:0%
law something you would like to be
 
01:39:34.010 --> 01:39:34.020 align:start position:0%
required in order to be a housing
 
01:39:36.050 --> 01:39:36.060 align:start position:0%
Champion so this is a completely opt-in
 
01:39:40.310 --> 01:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
program right housing okay so I I see no
 
01:39:41.689 --> 01:39:41.699 align:start position:0%
problem with this it's an odd it's
 
01:39:43.129 --> 01:39:43.139 align:start position:0%
opt-in it's further clarifying the
 
01:39:44.570 --> 01:39:44.580 align:start position:0%
legislature is giving some guidance to
 
01:39:44.580 --> 01:39:45.770 align:start position:0%
legislature is giving some guidance to
Bea

01:39:45.770 --> 01:39:45.780 align:start position:0%
Bea
 
01:39:47.510 --> 01:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
um with this but does anybody on the
 
01:39:48.530 --> 01:39:48.540 align:start position:0%
committee have anything to say about
 
01:39:51.050 --> 01:39:51.060 align:start position:0%
this amendment representative McConkey
 
01:39:54.350 --> 01:39:54.360 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm unfamiliar with the um the
 
01:39:56.090 --> 01:39:56.100 align:start position:0%
language and I'd like to see the
 
01:39:58.129 --> 01:39:58.139 align:start position:0%
language for that
 
01:39:59.990 --> 01:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
um perhaps you could educate me a little
 
01:40:02.709 --> 01:40:02.719 align:start position:0%
under uh line 10.
 
01:40:05.209 --> 01:40:05.219 align:start position:0%
for properties they're not connected
 
01:40:07.790 --> 01:40:07.800 align:start position:0%
Municipal Water and Sewer lines adopt
 
01:40:11.990 --> 01:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
adopt adoption of minimum lot size no
 
01:40:14.570 --> 01:40:14.580 align:start position:0%
greater than double the required septic
 
01:40:17.030 --> 01:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
radius for four bedroom septic system
 
01:40:19.430 --> 01:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
should be based on soil type
 
01:40:22.129 --> 01:40:22.139 align:start position:0%
I'm completely unfamiliar and I don't
 
01:40:24.290 --> 01:40:24.300 align:start position:0%
know if something was meant to be in
 
01:40:27.110 --> 01:40:27.120 align:start position:0%
there to say well radius is for four
 
01:40:30.830 --> 01:40:30.840 align:start position:0%
bedroom but the required septic radius
 
01:40:35.090 --> 01:40:35.100 align:start position:0%
radius is not a term that's used
 
01:40:35.100 --> 01:40:36.770 align:start position:0%
radius is not a term that's used
um

01:40:36.770 --> 01:40:36.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:39.910 --> 01:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
for the determination of
 
01:40:39.920 --> 01:40:42.070 align:start position:0%
for the determination of
environmental

01:40:42.070 --> 01:40:42.080 align:start position:0%
environmental
 
01:40:45.669 --> 01:40:45.679 align:start position:0%
rules and regulations subsurface
 
01:40:48.770 --> 01:40:48.780 align:start position:0%
ws-1000 so perhaps you know something
 
01:40:53.629 --> 01:40:53.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:57.590 --> 01:40:57.600 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you I was trying to so
 
01:41:01.370 --> 01:41:01.380 align:start position:0%
um on the plans there's a well there's a
 
01:41:05.149 --> 01:41:05.159 align:start position:0%
septic radius and a well radius that
 
01:41:07.189 --> 01:41:07.199 align:start position:0%
like I guess can't intersect or
 
01:41:09.229 --> 01:41:09.239 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
01:41:10.910 --> 01:41:10.920 align:start position:0%
um maybe you'd be more familiar with
 
01:41:13.610 --> 01:41:13.620 align:start position:0%
that but there is an actual radius
 
01:41:16.610 --> 01:41:16.620 align:start position:0%
usually drawn on the
 
01:41:19.490 --> 01:41:19.500 align:start position:0%
on the maps right I maybe it's a Well
 
01:41:21.770 --> 01:41:21.780 align:start position:0%
radius that that the septic can't be
 
01:41:24.169 --> 01:41:24.179 align:start position:0%
within or something like that um can you
 
01:41:27.350 --> 01:41:27.360 align:start position:0%
be sure yeah is there a way to better
 
01:41:30.229 --> 01:41:30.239 align:start position:0%
write that sentence well I I'd like I'd
 
01:41:32.810 --> 01:41:32.820 align:start position:0%
like to see where it came out of but so
 
01:41:34.970 --> 01:41:34.980 align:start position:0%
if you are creating a new subdivision
 
01:41:34.980 --> 01:41:36.770 align:start position:0%
if you are creating a new subdivision
and

01:41:36.770 --> 01:41:36.780 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:41:39.169 --> 01:41:39.179 align:start position:0%
um you would you would designate that
 
01:41:42.709 --> 01:41:42.719 align:start position:0%
and it was under five acres you would
 
01:41:44.330 --> 01:41:44.340 align:start position:0%
designate an area as part of the
 
01:41:46.129 --> 01:41:46.139 align:start position:0%
subdivision requirement that there was
 
01:41:48.050 --> 01:41:48.060 align:start position:0%
at least a four thousand square foot
 
01:41:51.250 --> 01:41:51.260 align:start position:0%
area that a septic system could go into
 
01:41:54.470 --> 01:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
so you you put that on your plan
 
01:41:57.470 --> 01:41:57.480 align:start position:0%
so anyone buying a lot that's less than
 
01:41:59.750 --> 01:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
five acres knows that they can put a
 
01:42:01.790 --> 01:42:01.800 align:start position:0%
septic system and they can buy it
 
01:42:03.470 --> 01:42:03.480 align:start position:0%
without a design they already know what
 
01:42:06.169 --> 01:42:06.179 align:start position:0%
happens then on top of that you would
 
01:42:09.950 --> 01:42:09.960 align:start position:0%
have a well radius which would be for a
 
01:42:11.810 --> 01:42:11.820 align:start position:0%
simple house up to five bedrooms would
 
01:42:13.270 --> 01:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
be 75
 
01:42:16.729 --> 01:42:16.739 align:start position:0%
footwell radius which works out to be uh
 
01:42:19.790 --> 01:42:19.800 align:start position:0%
0.41 Acres
 
01:42:19.800 --> 01:42:20.530 align:start position:0%
0.41 Acres
um

01:42:20.530 --> 01:42:20.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:24.290 --> 01:42:24.300 align:start position:0%
they they don't necessarily the way this
 
01:42:29.149 --> 01:42:29.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:32.689 --> 01:42:32.699 align:start position:0%
um and I I'm not I'm just saying that
 
01:42:35.810 --> 01:42:35.820 align:start position:0%
needs to be reworked and the the well
 
01:42:38.570 --> 01:42:38.580 align:start position:0%
the septic radius is is not a term
 
01:42:42.050 --> 01:42:42.060 align:start position:0%
that's used it's it depends on how good
 
01:42:45.410 --> 01:42:45.420 align:start position:0%
your soil is or how bad your soil is how
 
01:42:48.050 --> 01:42:48.060 align:start position:0%
many square foot of space you need
 
01:42:49.850 --> 01:42:49.860 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:42:52.729 --> 01:42:52.739 align:start position:0%
if you're willing to do what is still
 
01:42:55.370 --> 01:42:55.380 align:start position:0%
somewhat conventional systems you don't
 
01:42:57.229 --> 01:42:57.239 align:start position:0%
need all the four thousand square feet
 
01:42:59.510 --> 01:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
you may only need a thousand square feet
 
01:42:59.520 --> 01:43:01.850 align:start position:0%
you may only need a thousand square feet
so

01:43:01.850 --> 01:43:01.860 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:43:03.649 --> 01:43:03.659 align:start position:0%
um I I don't think you're getting what
 
01:43:07.850 --> 01:43:07.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:09.290 --> 01:43:09.300 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:43:13.550 --> 01:43:13.560 align:start position:0%
um what I'm trying to do mainly with
 
01:43:16.430 --> 01:43:16.440 align:start position:0%
this is is to
 
01:43:16.440 --> 01:43:18.709 align:start position:0%
this is is to
Thai

01:43:18.709 --> 01:43:18.719 align:start position:0%
Thai
 
01:43:21.490 --> 01:43:21.500 align:start position:0%
um the needs for water and septic
 
01:43:24.770 --> 01:43:24.780 align:start position:0%
and the soil type
 
01:43:24.780 --> 01:43:27.410 align:start position:0%
and the soil type
to

01:43:27.410 --> 01:43:27.420 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:43:27.420 --> 01:43:29.090 align:start position:0%
to
um

01:43:29.090 --> 01:43:29.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:31.430 --> 01:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
all combined
 
01:43:31.440 --> 01:43:33.129 align:start position:0%
all combined
um

01:43:33.129 --> 01:43:33.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:37.370 --> 01:43:37.380 align:start position:0%
and say that that size
 
01:43:39.530 --> 01:43:39.540 align:start position:0%
um let's say double that size
 
01:43:43.430 --> 01:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
requirement is the minimum
 
01:43:45.290 --> 01:43:45.300 align:start position:0%
is the maximum minimum that a
 
01:43:48.109 --> 01:43:48.119 align:start position:0%
municipality could put
 
01:43:50.810 --> 01:43:50.820 align:start position:0%
and be considered for housing Champion
 
01:43:54.649 --> 01:43:54.659 align:start position:0%
designation and so I'm trying to
 
01:43:57.350 --> 01:43:57.360 align:start position:0%
um get away encourage the municipalities
 
01:43:59.750 --> 01:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
to get away from the two-acre
 
01:44:02.270 --> 01:44:02.280 align:start position:0%
thing and say okay we're going to you
 
01:44:04.550 --> 01:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
know base it off of you know Des says
 
01:44:05.930 --> 01:44:05.940 align:start position:0%
we're going to need this much for septic
 
01:44:08.390 --> 01:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
and we're going to need this much for
 
01:44:10.850 --> 01:44:10.860 align:start position:0%
um water let's say and and
 
01:44:13.129 --> 01:44:13.139 align:start position:0%
um and then the municipality can go
 
01:44:15.109 --> 01:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
above and beyond that but not more than
 
01:44:17.270 --> 01:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
double that or something like that and
 
01:44:19.070 --> 01:44:19.080 align:start position:0%
that would be the minimum
 
01:44:21.470 --> 01:44:21.480 align:start position:0%
because after all we've we've stated
 
01:44:24.590 --> 01:44:24.600 align:start position:0%
before that it's all about help the
 
01:44:26.330 --> 01:44:26.340 align:start position:0%
purpose of zoning is about health and
 
01:44:30.410 --> 01:44:30.420 align:start position:0%
safety and so the double is you know I
 
01:44:32.810 --> 01:44:32.820 align:start position:0%
think the the
 
01:44:35.570 --> 01:44:35.580 align:start position:0%
you know what I'm trying to go for as
 
01:44:38.750 --> 01:44:38.760 align:start position:0%
like the flexibility of you know health
 
01:44:41.570 --> 01:44:41.580 align:start position:0%
and safety versus you know preference
 
01:44:44.330 --> 01:44:44.340 align:start position:0%
and then that would be if you go above
 
01:44:45.590 --> 01:44:45.600 align:start position:0%
that then you're not really a housing
 
01:44:48.070 --> 01:44:48.080 align:start position:0%
Champion you're just a regular
 
01:44:50.149 --> 01:44:50.159 align:start position:0%
municipality seems like such a special
 
01:44:50.159 --> 01:44:51.290 align:start position:0%
municipality seems like such a special
program

01:44:51.290 --> 01:44:51.300 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:44:53.629 --> 01:44:53.639 align:start position:0%
so is there a way that
 
01:44:54.830 --> 01:44:54.840 align:start position:0%
um yeah that's what I was trying to go
 
01:44:56.930 --> 01:44:56.940 align:start position:0%
for so if I if you have language or if
 
01:44:58.010 --> 01:44:58.020 align:start position:0%
you have a better sentence for
 
01:45:01.189 --> 01:45:01.199 align:start position:0%
representing if if the um if the um
 
01:45:02.810 --> 01:45:02.820 align:start position:0%
representative could send me the
 
01:45:04.550 --> 01:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
language or someone send me the language
 
01:45:06.470 --> 01:45:06.480 align:start position:0%
that's required to be a part of this
 
01:45:08.930 --> 01:45:08.940 align:start position:0%
program and I'm more than happy to see
 
01:45:11.930 --> 01:45:11.940 align:start position:0%
if I can help you craft that to to meet
 
01:45:14.870 --> 01:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
what you want so in the in the programs
 
01:45:17.270 --> 01:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
in its very infant stages so I think
 
01:45:19.729 --> 01:45:19.739 align:start position:0%
this is a good time to provide some
 
01:45:21.770 --> 01:45:21.780 align:start position:0%
additional guidance I I we're leaving a
 
01:45:24.109 --> 01:45:24.119 align:start position:0%
lot of the discretion up to Bea
 
01:45:26.750 --> 01:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
um but if we want to provide like some
 
01:45:28.970 --> 01:45:28.980 align:start position:0%
guidance I think that would be important
 
01:45:30.590 --> 01:45:30.600 align:start position:0%
um representative yokella then
 
01:45:35.109 --> 01:45:35.119 align:start position:0%
representative yeah um so so the only
 
01:45:37.609 --> 01:45:37.619 align:start position:0%
language right now there is no language
 
01:45:40.910 --> 01:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
for the housing designation yet because
 
01:45:43.129 --> 01:45:43.139 align:start position:0%
it hasn't officially become I don't
 
01:45:46.790 --> 01:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
think it's um in enacted yet I mean it
 
01:45:48.470 --> 01:45:48.480 align:start position:0%
depends if we if the governor signed the
 
01:45:51.470 --> 01:45:51.480 align:start position:0%
budget and you know if if they're the
 
01:45:54.410 --> 01:45:54.420 align:start position:0%
enacting Clause has gone into effect so
 
01:45:55.669 --> 01:45:55.679 align:start position:0%
I don't think that they've built
 
01:45:59.030 --> 01:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
anything so all I'm doing is just adding
 
01:46:00.530 --> 01:46:00.540 align:start position:0%
to a different
 
01:46:02.330 --> 01:46:02.340 align:start position:0%
um so the only
 
01:46:04.430 --> 01:46:04.440 align:start position:0%
only requirements right now are a
 
01:46:05.510 --> 01:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
through d
 
01:46:11.209 --> 01:46:11.219 align:start position:0%
in this uh uh RSA 12071 Roman 3. so a
 
01:46:13.550 --> 01:46:13.560 align:start position:0%
through D and then I'm just adding e f
 
01:46:16.550 --> 01:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
and g to say you know when you're doing
 
01:46:18.169 --> 01:46:18.179 align:start position:0%
these requirements they have to include
 
01:46:21.050 --> 01:46:21.060 align:start position:0%
these things otherwise they they
 
01:46:23.390 --> 01:46:23.400 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be qualified
 
01:46:25.129 --> 01:46:25.139 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
01:46:28.310 --> 01:46:28.320 align:start position:0%
um not to uh belabor the point but if I
 
01:46:31.189 --> 01:46:31.199 align:start position:0%
can see what's a through D I think your
 
01:46:34.430 --> 01:46:34.440 align:start position:0%
uh your statement f
 
01:46:38.330 --> 01:46:38.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:38.340 --> 01:46:39.169 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:46:39.169 --> 01:46:39.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:42.609 --> 01:46:42.619 align:start position:0%
and E and G is probably perfectly fine
 
01:46:48.169 --> 01:46:48.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:50.689 --> 01:46:50.699 align:start position:0%
okay so action item representative
 
01:46:53.629 --> 01:46:53.639 align:start position:0%
yokella I'm letting you take that
 
01:46:56.570 --> 01:46:56.580 align:start position:0%
representative Reed thank you and this
 
01:46:58.310 --> 01:46:58.320 align:start position:0%
is just a first of all I'd like to thank
 
01:46:59.810 --> 01:46:59.820 align:start position:0%
representative for working on this
 
01:47:02.510 --> 01:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
because I wholeheartedly agree and
 
01:47:04.850 --> 01:47:04.860 align:start position:0%
um and appreciate the work here
 
01:47:06.649 --> 01:47:06.659 align:start position:0%
um I know that we heard in presentation
 
01:47:08.750 --> 01:47:08.760 align:start position:0%
that according to the technology
 
01:47:10.010 --> 01:47:10.020 align:start position:0%
available that there were Technologies
 
01:47:12.290 --> 01:47:12.300 align:start position:0%
available that would even further reduce
 
01:47:15.410 --> 01:47:15.420 align:start position:0%
the the footage requirement
 
01:47:18.050 --> 01:47:18.060 align:start position:0%
um might there not be language in here
 
01:47:20.330 --> 01:47:20.340 align:start position:0%
that ties That to the to say that the
 
01:47:22.490 --> 01:47:22.500 align:start position:0%
municipality shall allow because I
 
01:47:23.810 --> 01:47:23.820 align:start position:0%
understand that they don't allow a lot
 
01:47:24.950 --> 01:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
of those Technologies but the
 
01:47:26.149 --> 01:47:26.159 align:start position:0%
municipality shall allow those
 
01:47:29.030 --> 01:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
Technologies and tie the minimum to what
 
01:47:31.250 --> 01:47:31.260 align:start position:0%
that technology would like it could
 
01:47:32.870 --> 01:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
still be twice of whatever the
 
01:47:34.430 --> 01:47:34.440 align:start position:0%
requirement but what that technology
 
01:47:37.490 --> 01:47:37.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:40.609 --> 01:47:40.619 align:start position:0%
so that'd be something to think about
 
01:47:42.770 --> 01:47:42.780 align:start position:0%
therapy thank you for the suggestion
 
01:47:44.810 --> 01:47:44.820 align:start position:0%
I'll I will be considering that thank
 
01:47:44.820 --> 01:47:45.590 align:start position:0%
I'll I will be considering that thank
you

01:47:45.590 --> 01:47:45.600 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:47:45.600 --> 01:47:47.330 align:start position:0%
you
guys

01:47:47.330 --> 01:47:47.340 align:start position:0%
guys
 
01:47:50.810 --> 01:47:50.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:53.209 --> 01:47:53.219 align:start position:0%
so reasonable parking requirements I
 
01:47:55.970 --> 01:47:55.980 align:start position:0%
know we identified
 
01:48:02.450 --> 01:48:02.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:06.350 --> 01:48:06.360 align:start position:0%
down and streamline I'm on commercials
 
01:48:08.450 --> 01:48:08.460 align:start position:0%
I mean does anyone else worked on
 
01:48:10.669 --> 01:48:10.679 align:start position:0%
streamlining Municipal I guess yeah I'm
 
01:48:12.950 --> 01:48:12.960 align:start position:0%
looking at is there anything that we've
 
01:48:14.870 --> 01:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
heard from our presentations about
 
01:48:16.669 --> 01:48:16.679 align:start position:0%
streamlining Municipal inspections that
 
01:48:18.590 --> 01:48:18.600 align:start position:0%
we think that we could
 
01:48:18.600 --> 01:48:19.370 align:start position:0%
we think that we could
um

01:48:19.370 --> 01:48:19.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:21.109 --> 01:48:21.119 align:start position:0%
help clarify or this committee could
 
01:48:23.209 --> 01:48:23.219 align:start position:0%
look at and is there anybody that wants
 
01:48:25.189 --> 01:48:25.199 align:start position:0%
to take that on or look at what the
 
01:48:27.050 --> 01:48:27.060 align:start position:0%
inspection process is for municipalities
 
01:48:28.310 --> 01:48:28.320 align:start position:0%
and how we can
 
01:48:33.109 --> 01:48:33.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:35.870 --> 01:48:35.880 align:start position:0%
okay um representative Walsh can you
 
01:48:37.669 --> 01:48:37.679 align:start position:0%
just give us an outline of
 
01:48:40.189 --> 01:48:40.199 align:start position:0%
the inspection process
 
01:48:43.310 --> 01:48:43.320 align:start position:0%
yeah I was just going to suggest um
 
01:48:44.930 --> 01:48:44.940 align:start position:0%
because I did talk about this a few
 
01:48:46.010 --> 01:48:46.020 align:start position:0%
times and I thought it was one of the
 
01:48:47.450 --> 01:48:47.460 align:start position:0%
things we could certainly all agree on
 
01:48:49.250 --> 01:48:49.260 align:start position:0%
it's just for it helps everybody to
 
01:48:51.950 --> 01:48:51.960 align:start position:0%
streamline these these approvals and I
 
01:48:53.209 --> 01:48:53.219 align:start position:0%
had a conversation with somebody else
 
01:48:56.030 --> 01:48:56.040 align:start position:0%
too uh and I have not verified it yet
 
01:48:58.850 --> 01:48:58.860 align:start position:0%
whether or not the current housing
 
01:49:01.430 --> 01:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
appeals board can even hear situations
 
01:49:04.430 --> 01:49:04.440 align:start position:0%
of appeals from say fire or or building
 
01:49:04.440 --> 01:49:06.109 align:start position:0%
of appeals from say fire or or building
codes

01:49:06.109 --> 01:49:06.119 align:start position:0%
codes
 
01:49:08.390 --> 01:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
um I don't I'm not prepared to speak too
 
01:49:10.189 --> 01:49:10.199 align:start position:0%
much in detail but I certainly think it
 
01:49:12.169 --> 01:49:12.179 align:start position:0%
deserves a subcommittee to try to come
 
01:49:14.030 --> 01:49:14.040 align:start position:0%
up to some answers yeah so I think you
 
01:49:15.709 --> 01:49:15.719 align:start position:0%
stepped out of the room we went so
 
01:49:17.810 --> 01:49:17.820 align:start position:0%
number two
 
01:49:20.629 --> 01:49:20.639 align:start position:0%
um we're getting language from a former
 
01:49:23.030 --> 01:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
chair of the hab who can
 
01:49:23.040 --> 01:49:24.109 align:start position:0%
chair of the hab who can
um

01:49:24.109 --> 01:49:24.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:26.629 --> 01:49:26.639 align:start position:0%
subject suggest clarifying a language
 
01:49:29.030 --> 01:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
that would allow so I'm looking at on
 
01:49:32.750 --> 01:49:32.760 align:start position:0%
the memo to C and looking at adding all
 
01:49:34.310 --> 01:49:34.320 align:start position:0%
of these is like reasons you could
 
01:49:38.209 --> 01:49:38.219 align:start position:0%
appeal and we'll have that mirror that
 
01:49:40.669 --> 01:49:40.679 align:start position:0%
language mirrored in the
 
01:49:43.250 --> 01:49:43.260 align:start position:0%
um land you socket that we also just
 
01:49:44.990 --> 01:49:45.000 align:start position:0%
passed so that it's kind of two
 
01:49:46.970 --> 01:49:46.980 align:start position:0%
different Avenues
 
01:49:50.030 --> 01:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
um and we can clarify that how they're a
 
01:49:52.070 --> 01:49:52.080 align:start position:0%
ruling from the State Fire Marshal or
 
01:49:54.050 --> 01:49:54.060 align:start position:0%
Etc that could be
 
01:49:55.850 --> 01:49:55.860 align:start position:0%
um appealed there so maybe that would
 
01:49:57.890 --> 01:49:57.900 align:start position:0%
help solve some of that
 
01:49:59.750 --> 01:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
and streamline it yeah the only concern
 
01:50:02.689 --> 01:50:02.699 align:start position:0%
is we may hear if we we keep specifying
 
01:50:02.699 --> 01:50:04.189 align:start position:0%
is we may hear if we we keep specifying
more

01:50:04.189 --> 01:50:04.199 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:50:07.370 --> 01:50:07.380 align:start position:0%
responsibilities to that they may not
 
01:50:08.689 --> 01:50:08.699 align:start position:0%
have the Manpower I don't know what
 
01:50:10.790 --> 01:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
their docket looks like currently so it
 
01:50:12.410 --> 01:50:12.420 align:start position:0%
is a concern but it's worth looking into
 
01:50:14.870 --> 01:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
okay so we're gonna get some we're gonna
 
01:50:16.490 --> 01:50:16.500 align:start position:0%
get some language so I'll I'll be the
 
01:50:17.810 --> 01:50:17.820 align:start position:0%
point person on that and I'll be able to
 
01:50:21.410 --> 01:50:21.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:24.410 --> 01:50:24.420 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
01:50:26.689 --> 01:50:26.699 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at the rest of these
 
01:50:28.310 --> 01:50:28.320 align:start position:0%
right here on the memo is there anything
 
01:50:30.350 --> 01:50:30.360 align:start position:0%
that anybody would like to discuss
 
01:50:32.330 --> 01:50:32.340 align:start position:0%
further down so
 
01:50:36.410 --> 01:50:36.420 align:start position:0%
impact fees building code or via review
 
01:50:43.970 --> 01:50:43.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:46.609 --> 01:50:46.619 align:start position:0%
I mean I'm intrigued by
 
01:50:48.890 --> 01:50:48.900 align:start position:0%
did we are I'm sorry I kind of blanked
 
01:50:51.530 --> 01:50:51.540 align:start position:0%
out we were already covering the
 
01:50:53.450 --> 01:50:53.460 align:start position:0%
expansion of commercially to include
 
01:50:57.290 --> 01:50:57.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:59.510 --> 01:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
um is that already being taken care of
 
01:51:02.030 --> 01:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
by somebody no I I don't know if I would
 
01:51:04.129 --> 01:51:04.139 align:start position:0%
be in favor of that but I would like to
 
01:51:07.490 --> 01:51:07.500 align:start position:0%
at least see language on that okay
 
01:51:10.070 --> 01:51:10.080 align:start position:0%
um I Kristen also put together a memo on
 
01:51:12.470 --> 01:51:12.480 align:start position:0%
impact fees I don't think
 
01:51:14.629 --> 01:51:14.639 align:start position:0%
you printed you printed like half and on
 
01:51:17.390 --> 01:51:17.400 align:start position:0%
all of it so we also have an opportunity
 
01:51:19.970 --> 01:51:19.980 align:start position:0%
to designate that a certain amount of
 
01:51:22.490 --> 01:51:22.500 align:start position:0%
impact fees goes towards
 
01:51:24.649 --> 01:51:24.659 align:start position:0%
some funding mechanism and municipality
 
01:51:26.570 --> 01:51:26.580 align:start position:0%
is that something that anybody
 
01:51:28.669 --> 01:51:28.679 align:start position:0%
wanted to look further into
 
01:51:30.470 --> 01:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
because some municipalities charge it
 
01:51:32.390 --> 01:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
some don't so maybe we could say if you
 
01:51:36.050 --> 01:51:36.060 align:start position:0%
do charge it it goes towards you know
 
01:51:38.330 --> 01:51:38.340 align:start position:0%
what should the impact fees go ahead
 
01:51:39.890 --> 01:51:39.900 align:start position:0%
just put it back on
 
01:51:42.109 --> 01:51:42.119 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman most of the impact
 
01:51:44.510 --> 01:51:44.520 align:start position:0%
fees are already designated for
 
01:51:47.149 --> 01:51:47.159 align:start position:0%
something like schools fire and things
 
01:51:48.890 --> 01:51:48.900 align:start position:0%
like that and I think that's already
 
01:51:52.850 --> 01:51:52.860 align:start position:0%
being done as far as designations
 
01:51:54.830 --> 01:51:54.840 align:start position:0%
okay I didn't know if we wanted to make
 
01:51:57.470 --> 01:51:57.480 align:start position:0%
it more targeted or leave it flexible I
 
01:51:59.870 --> 01:51:59.880 align:start position:0%
mean I I don't think it's fair for them
 
01:52:02.870 --> 01:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
to charge in fact fees uh on smaller
 
01:52:05.209 --> 01:52:05.219 align:start position:0%
units that you know aren't going to have
 
01:52:07.430 --> 01:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
any children but the schools also have
 
01:52:10.010 --> 01:52:10.020 align:start position:0%
that impact feat so they want to build a
 
01:52:11.270 --> 01:52:11.280 align:start position:0%
building with a bunch of efficiency
 
01:52:13.490 --> 01:52:13.500 align:start position:0%
apartments and they're going to require
 
01:52:16.310 --> 01:52:16.320 align:start position:0%
me to pay a school fee you know you know
 
01:52:18.649 --> 01:52:18.659 align:start position:0%
there's no kids going to live there you
 
01:52:22.310 --> 01:52:22.320 align:start position:0%
know that's something we could look into
 
01:52:25.850 --> 01:52:25.860 align:start position:0%
represent Damon or my apartment home
 
01:52:29.570 --> 01:52:29.580 align:start position:0%
we might want to look at newer research
 
01:52:29.580 --> 01:52:32.090 align:start position:0%
we might want to look at newer research
on

01:52:32.090 --> 01:52:32.100 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:52:34.490 --> 01:52:34.500 align:start position:0%
School utilization because Public School
 
01:52:37.430 --> 01:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
enrollment has declined so much
 
01:52:40.609 --> 01:52:40.619 align:start position:0%
there's a threshold we're increasing the
 
01:52:42.709 --> 01:52:42.719 align:start position:0%
number of children attending schools is
 
01:52:45.109 --> 01:52:45.119 align:start position:0%
not increasing cost because you're not
 
01:52:47.510 --> 01:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
needing greater facilities or greater
 
01:52:47.520 --> 01:52:48.709 align:start position:0%
needing greater facilities or greater
staff

01:52:48.709 --> 01:52:48.719 align:start position:0%
staff
 
01:52:51.590 --> 01:52:51.600 align:start position:0%
and I think there is some preliminary
 
01:52:54.709 --> 01:52:54.719 align:start position:0%
research on that maybe out of Yukon
 
01:52:56.750 --> 01:52:56.760 align:start position:0%
um but that should be incorporated into
 
01:53:01.490 --> 01:53:01.500 align:start position:0%
that there or could be incorporated it
 
01:53:01.500 --> 01:53:04.550 align:start position:0%
that there or could be incorporated it
representative

01:53:04.550 --> 01:53:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:04.560 --> 01:53:04.910 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:53:04.910 --> 01:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:53:04.920 --> 01:53:07.010 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

01:53:07.010 --> 01:53:07.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:10.790 --> 01:53:10.800 align:start position:0%
if if I remember correctly the impact
 
01:53:12.590 --> 01:53:12.600 align:start position:0%
fees are designated for a specific
 
01:53:16.729 --> 01:53:16.739 align:start position:0%
purpose so if they were if they were for
 
01:53:20.330 --> 01:53:20.340 align:start position:0%
um school and that school
 
01:53:22.550 --> 01:53:22.560 align:start position:0%
um and have to be
 
01:53:22.560 --> 01:53:24.709 align:start position:0%
um and have to be
um

01:53:24.709 --> 01:53:24.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:26.930 --> 01:53:26.940 align:start position:0%
and if they're not used then they would
 
01:53:29.090 --> 01:53:29.100 align:start position:0%
be returned to the
 
01:53:32.930 --> 01:53:32.940 align:start position:0%
to the people that um
 
01:53:36.830 --> 01:53:36.840 align:start position:0%
that paid them right so if they if those
 
01:53:39.169 --> 01:53:39.179 align:start position:0%
those P that development that the
 
01:53:40.910 --> 01:53:40.920 align:start position:0%
representative was talking about did not
 
01:53:43.370 --> 01:53:43.380 align:start position:0%
have an impact wouldn't the money just
 
01:53:46.609 --> 01:53:46.619 align:start position:0%
be returned or you're trying to
 
01:53:46.619 --> 01:53:47.830 align:start position:0%
be returned or you're trying to
um

01:53:47.830 --> 01:53:47.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:50.750 --> 01:53:50.760 align:start position:0%
reduce the cost of that borrowing of
 
01:53:53.330 --> 01:53:53.340 align:start position:0%
that money or is there any is there any
 
01:53:57.290 --> 01:53:57.300 align:start position:0%
way I think developers indicated that
 
01:53:59.990 --> 01:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
impact fees are an impediment towards
 
01:54:01.850 --> 01:54:01.860 align:start position:0%
development so is there any way to
 
01:54:04.910 --> 01:54:04.920 align:start position:0%
create language that would allow is
 
01:54:06.470 --> 01:54:06.480 align:start position:0%
there anything stopping Miss Pally from
 
01:54:09.109 --> 01:54:09.119 align:start position:0%
allowing 20 years to pay the impact fee
 
01:54:11.330 --> 01:54:11.340 align:start position:0%
instead of one year or
 
01:54:13.669 --> 01:54:13.679 align:start position:0%
um could we
 
01:54:15.950 --> 01:54:15.960 align:start position:0%
you know say that
 
01:54:19.310 --> 01:54:19.320 align:start position:0%
a developer or somebody that makes a it
 
01:54:21.290 --> 01:54:21.300 align:start position:0%
creates a proposal
 
01:54:21.300 --> 01:54:21.890 align:start position:0%
creates a proposal
um

01:54:21.890 --> 01:54:21.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:24.649 --> 01:54:24.659 align:start position:0%
may ask for a 10-year payment plan
 
01:54:26.270 --> 01:54:26.280 align:start position:0%
instead of a one year I don't know how
 
01:54:28.850 --> 01:54:28.860 align:start position:0%
the committee feels about that I think
 
01:54:30.470 --> 01:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
that would be a good idea because that
 
01:54:31.910 --> 01:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
does stop people
 
01:54:33.830 --> 01:54:33.840 align:start position:0%
I mean the guy from Riddle was a good
 
01:54:36.050 --> 01:54:36.060 align:start position:0%
example of what what he was saying and
 
01:54:39.709 --> 01:54:39.719 align:start position:0%
agonized too and it's a lot of sort of
 
01:54:42.169 --> 01:54:42.179 align:start position:0%
upfront money it can spread it out and
 
01:54:44.090 --> 01:54:44.100 align:start position:0%
even maybe charge interest or something
 
01:54:47.390 --> 01:54:47.400 align:start position:0%
well they're making payments it would
 
01:54:49.850 --> 01:54:49.860 align:start position:0%
help people get in help people get
 
01:54:52.129 --> 01:54:52.139 align:start position:0%
started bring down the cost of the
 
01:54:55.070 --> 01:54:55.080 align:start position:0%
construction is what we're looking at so
 
01:54:57.290 --> 01:54:57.300 align:start position:0%
um my resident planning board member is
 
01:54:58.370 --> 01:54:58.380 align:start position:0%
um representative Walsh is there
 
01:55:00.410 --> 01:55:00.420 align:start position:0%
anything required um
 
01:55:02.629 --> 01:55:02.639 align:start position:0%
prohibiting a municipality from doing
 
01:55:06.350 --> 01:55:06.360 align:start position:0%
that now or do you think there could be
 
01:55:08.810 --> 01:55:08.820 align:start position:0%
language put in there that would clarify
 
01:55:10.669 --> 01:55:10.679 align:start position:0%
that they're allowed to a developer can
 
01:55:12.350 --> 01:55:12.360 align:start position:0%
request that or municipality is allowed
 
01:55:14.510 --> 01:55:14.520 align:start position:0%
to do it so I understand you your
 
01:55:16.250 --> 01:55:16.260 align:start position:0%
question correctly as far as I know it's
 
01:55:18.109 --> 01:55:18.119 align:start position:0%
upfront money I don't know of any
 
01:55:19.850 --> 01:55:19.860 align:start position:0%
mechanism or tool for them to stretch it
 
01:55:22.430 --> 01:55:22.440 align:start position:0%
out I will also say as being part of a
 
01:55:25.790 --> 01:55:25.800 align:start position:0%
town that that does impose impact fees I
 
01:55:27.830 --> 01:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
cannot tell you an example where any
 
01:55:30.770 --> 01:55:30.780 align:start position:0%
money was returned uh it's just when you
 
01:55:32.570 --> 01:55:32.580 align:start position:0%
see and I'm not targeting anybody but
 
01:55:34.669 --> 01:55:34.679 align:start position:0%
whether it's fire school or whatever the
 
01:55:37.189 --> 01:55:37.199 align:start position:0%
budgets go up every year anyway so it's
 
01:55:39.290 --> 01:55:39.300 align:start position:0%
so long as budgets are going up based on
 
01:55:41.450 --> 01:55:41.460 align:start position:0%
and development's going up there's a
 
01:55:43.070 --> 01:55:43.080 align:start position:0%
justification for the money to disappear
 
01:55:45.649 --> 01:55:45.659 align:start position:0%
so do we need enabling language that
 
01:55:48.109 --> 01:55:48.119 align:start position:0%
would allow municipality I got your
 
01:55:49.550 --> 01:55:49.560 align:start position:0%
representative that would allow
 
01:55:51.950 --> 01:55:51.960 align:start position:0%
municipality to charge impact fees for
 
01:55:54.050 --> 01:55:54.060 align:start position:0%
20 years instead of one year yeah if you
 
01:55:56.330 --> 01:55:56.340 align:start position:0%
want to take that as an angle uh I can
 
01:55:58.729 --> 01:55:58.739 align:start position:0%
see that the legitimate legitimacy of
 
01:56:00.830 --> 01:56:00.840 align:start position:0%
that we would need language you can't do
 
01:56:03.229 --> 01:56:03.239 align:start position:0%
it right now as far as I know yep okay I
 
01:56:04.729 --> 01:56:04.739 align:start position:0%
will um
 
01:56:06.890 --> 01:56:06.900 align:start position:0%
does any I don't mind working on that as
 
01:56:08.030 --> 01:56:08.040 align:start position:0%
somebody else or unless somebody else
 
01:56:10.070 --> 01:56:10.080 align:start position:0%
really so chopping at the bit
 
01:56:12.290 --> 01:56:12.300 align:start position:0%
representative Reed specifically that's
 
01:56:14.750 --> 01:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
what Manchester was requesting was a
 
01:56:17.689 --> 01:56:17.699 align:start position:0%
20-year return I believe we currently
 
01:56:21.590 --> 01:56:21.600 align:start position:0%
have a requirement for a six-year return
 
01:56:25.070 --> 01:56:25.080 align:start position:0%
um so just to clarify so we expand um
 
01:56:27.229 --> 01:56:27.239 align:start position:0%
sixth year to 20 year
 
01:56:32.270 --> 01:56:32.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:35.330 --> 01:56:35.340 align:start position:0%
representative yokello so representative
 
01:56:37.850 --> 01:56:37.860 align:start position:0%
was talking about how how fast you have
 
01:56:39.410 --> 01:56:39.420 align:start position:0%
to return the money
 
01:56:39.420 --> 01:56:40.250 align:start position:0%
to return the money
um

01:56:40.250 --> 01:56:40.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:42.010 --> 01:56:42.020 align:start position:0%
what I'm
 
01:56:44.570 --> 01:56:44.580 align:start position:0%
thinking about as you talk about like oh
 
01:56:46.850 --> 01:56:46.860 align:start position:0%
being able to collect you know some
 
01:56:48.050 --> 01:56:48.060 align:start position:0%
amount of money let's say a hundred
 
01:56:49.669 --> 01:56:49.679 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars over
 
01:56:52.910 --> 01:56:52.920 align:start position:0%
um you know 20 years or whatever
 
01:56:52.920 --> 01:56:54.010 align:start position:0%
um you know 20 years or whatever
um

01:56:54.010 --> 01:56:54.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:57.169 --> 01:56:57.179 align:start position:0%
the mechanism for that for someone that
 
01:56:59.270 --> 01:56:59.280 align:start position:0%
is building the property and then
 
01:57:01.609 --> 01:57:01.619 align:start position:0%
selling the property
 
01:57:03.770 --> 01:57:03.780 align:start position:0%
um it would seem like that would need to
 
01:57:05.810 --> 01:57:05.820 align:start position:0%
be as par like part of the deed or
 
01:57:07.850 --> 01:57:07.860 align:start position:0%
whatever that they're supposed to be you
 
01:57:10.189 --> 01:57:10.199 align:start position:0%
know payments and the amount of you know
 
01:57:13.430 --> 01:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
you know you know one thousand dollars
 
01:57:18.350 --> 01:57:18.360 align:start position:0%
per per month until you know such date
 
01:57:21.470 --> 01:57:21.480 align:start position:0%
you know 2027 or whatever the case may
 
01:57:23.089 --> 01:57:23.099 align:start position:0%
be being in the deed or something like
 
01:57:25.010 --> 01:57:25.020 align:start position:0%
that I don't know how you would do that
 
01:57:26.990 --> 01:57:27.000 align:start position:0%
while if the person sells it to the
 
01:57:28.609 --> 01:57:28.619 align:start position:0%
weeds I think all we need to do is go in
 
01:57:31.370 --> 01:57:31.380 align:start position:0%
and say if you want to you can charge
 
01:57:33.109 --> 01:57:33.119 align:start position:0%
this and then they have to figure that
 
01:57:34.850 --> 01:57:34.860 align:start position:0%
out we don't have to clarify that for
 
01:57:37.550 --> 01:57:37.560 align:start position:0%
them yeah and if somebody's building it
 
01:57:39.109 --> 01:57:39.119 align:start position:0%
and selling it it could be part of the
 
01:57:40.970 --> 01:57:40.980 align:start position:0%
sales agreement that that's paid during
 
01:57:43.430 --> 01:57:43.440 align:start position:0%
the sale but that'll be between the
 
01:57:47.649 --> 01:57:47.659 align:start position:0%
developer municipality and the buyer
 
01:57:50.470 --> 01:57:50.480 align:start position:0%
uh representative Walsh yeah
 
01:57:53.750 --> 01:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
I'm all set I had the same questions uh
 
01:57:56.330 --> 01:57:56.340 align:start position:0%
representative okay no thank you just
 
01:57:58.850 --> 01:57:58.860 align:start position:0%
for clarity just so I'm clear too I must
 
01:58:00.410 --> 01:58:00.420 align:start position:0%
I must have misunderstood you it is
 
01:58:02.570 --> 01:58:02.580 align:start position:0%
correct it's upfront money now and
 
01:58:04.970 --> 01:58:04.980 align:start position:0%
you've got six years to use it uh before
 
01:58:06.890 --> 01:58:06.900 align:start position:0%
you have to give it back my point is
 
01:58:09.050 --> 01:58:09.060 align:start position:0%
I've never seen it given back because
 
01:58:11.570 --> 01:58:11.580 align:start position:0%
the budgets keep climbing every year and
 
01:58:14.330 --> 01:58:14.340 align:start position:0%
that money uh from the impact fees is
 
01:58:15.950 --> 01:58:15.960 align:start position:0%
part of it so
 
01:58:17.930 --> 01:58:17.940 align:start position:0%
so I thought you were looking at a way
 
01:58:20.030 --> 01:58:20.040 align:start position:0%
to reduce The Upfront money yes that's
 
01:58:21.649 --> 01:58:21.659 align:start position:0%
what I was expecting we were mixing two
 
01:58:22.669 --> 01:58:22.679 align:start position:0%
things so
 
01:58:24.890 --> 01:58:24.900 align:start position:0%
I want to put in enabling language that
 
01:58:26.510 --> 01:58:26.520 align:start position:0%
would allow municipality to charge
 
01:58:28.790 --> 01:58:28.800 align:start position:0%
impact fees for an extended period of
 
01:58:31.910 --> 01:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
time at a at a smaller rate and then
 
01:58:34.070 --> 01:58:34.080 align:start position:0%
allow charge reasonable interest or
 
01:58:34.080 --> 01:58:34.970 align:start position:0%
allow charge reasonable interest or
something

01:58:34.970 --> 01:58:34.980 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:58:37.490 --> 01:58:37.500 align:start position:0%
on it if a developer if that agreement
 
01:58:40.010 --> 01:58:40.020 align:start position:0%
is reached between misspelling developer
 
01:58:41.689 --> 01:58:41.699 align:start position:0%
so I'll send language over but is there
 
01:58:44.450 --> 01:58:44.460 align:start position:0%
anybody that's totally against that idea
 
01:58:47.270 --> 01:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
nobody okay we're gonna work on that
 
01:58:49.250 --> 01:58:49.260 align:start position:0%
did you have something representative I
 
01:58:52.430 --> 01:58:52.440 align:start position:0%
would just say on um thinking through if
 
01:58:54.410 --> 01:58:54.420 align:start position:0%
it's a larger development that the
 
01:58:56.209 --> 01:58:56.219 align:start position:0%
impact fees would only be by whatever
 
01:58:59.689 --> 01:58:59.699 align:start position:0%
phase they're in and if a unit if it's a
 
01:59:02.030 --> 01:59:02.040 align:start position:0%
unit should be sold then you should
 
01:59:04.550 --> 01:59:04.560 align:start position:0%
consider that unit when it sold that
 
01:59:07.310 --> 01:59:07.320 align:start position:0%
money has to be paid okay and try and
 
01:59:09.589 --> 01:59:09.599 align:start position:0%
keep out of making people Bond you know
 
01:59:11.390 --> 01:59:11.400 align:start position:0%
the total number because that becomes
 
01:59:15.530 --> 01:59:15.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:16.669 --> 01:59:16.679 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:59:21.169 --> 01:59:21.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:25.550 --> 01:59:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:27.950 --> 01:59:27.960 align:start position:0%
as far as number eight the pre-approval
 
01:59:29.629 --> 01:59:29.639 align:start position:0%
for multi-family housing developments
 
01:59:32.270 --> 01:59:32.280 align:start position:0%
that meet fire safety design and health
 
01:59:32.280 --> 01:59:33.470 align:start position:0%
that meet fire safety design and health
standards

01:59:33.470 --> 01:59:33.480 align:start position:0%
standards
 
01:59:35.270 --> 01:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
would that be according to our national
 
01:59:35.280 --> 01:59:37.370 align:start position:0%
would that be according to our national
standard

01:59:37.370 --> 01:59:37.380 align:start position:0%
standard
 
01:59:39.290 --> 01:59:39.300 align:start position:0%
um or a regional standard or a state
 
01:59:41.030 --> 01:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
standard because I'm thinking of more of
 
01:59:43.189 --> 01:59:43.199 align:start position:0%
like a plug and play type Building
 
01:59:47.089 --> 01:59:47.099 align:start position:0%
Development so how would how would that
 
01:59:48.890 --> 01:59:48.900 align:start position:0%
why it's good
 
01:59:51.050 --> 01:59:51.060 align:start position:0%
um representative color
 
01:59:52.370 --> 01:59:52.380 align:start position:0%
so if
 
01:59:54.290 --> 01:59:54.300 align:start position:0%
um as I was kind of talking about before
 
01:59:56.330 --> 01:59:56.340 align:start position:0%
I was looking into kind of the
 
01:59:59.570 --> 01:59:59.580 align:start position:0%
pre-approval for the Adu and Seattle's
 
02:00:03.470 --> 02:00:03.480 align:start position:0%
situation but what I'm what I am
 
02:00:06.649 --> 02:00:06.659 align:start position:0%
envisioning is not something that was
 
02:00:09.709 --> 02:00:09.719 align:start position:0%
limited to adus but limited is is
 
02:00:12.410 --> 02:00:12.420 align:start position:0%
available for you know people that do 3D
 
02:00:16.729 --> 02:00:16.739 align:start position:0%
houses or do construction off-site that
 
02:00:18.589 --> 02:00:18.599 align:start position:0%
might that
 
02:00:18.599 --> 02:00:19.790 align:start position:0%
might that
um

02:00:19.790 --> 02:00:19.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:22.669 --> 02:00:22.679 align:start position:0%
you know the pl those the blocks that
 
02:00:25.430 --> 02:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
that fit together all these different
 
02:00:28.910 --> 02:00:28.920 align:start position:0%
kind of designs that that are being
 
02:00:28.920 --> 02:00:31.430 align:start position:0%
kind of designs that that are being
produced

02:00:31.430 --> 02:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
produced
 
02:00:35.030 --> 02:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
um should be able to go to what I'm
 
02:00:36.830 --> 02:00:36.840 align:start position:0%
thinking as either the regional Planning
 
02:00:38.629 --> 02:00:38.639 align:start position:0%
Commission or something like that and
 
02:00:40.370 --> 02:00:40.380 align:start position:0%
they would go through kind of the
 
02:00:42.290 --> 02:00:42.300 align:start position:0%
approval process instead of at the local
 
02:00:44.270 --> 02:00:44.280 align:start position:0%
level they would do it at the regional
 
02:00:46.669 --> 02:00:46.679 align:start position:0%
or the state level and they would go
 
02:00:48.530 --> 02:00:48.540 align:start position:0%
through kind of the exact same process
 
02:00:50.570 --> 02:00:50.580 align:start position:0%
that they would do at the local level
 
02:00:52.790 --> 02:00:52.800 align:start position:0%
except Joe is do it at the state level
 
02:00:54.169 --> 02:00:54.179 align:start position:0%
and then it would just be approved for
 
02:00:56.330 --> 02:00:56.340 align:start position:0%
all kind of the subdivisions below that
 
02:00:59.089 --> 02:00:59.099 align:start position:0%
and then they would have to kind of go
 
02:01:02.209 --> 02:01:02.219 align:start position:0%
separately for you know the footings and
 
02:01:03.709 --> 02:01:03.719 align:start position:0%
the drainage and all of that stuff for
 
02:01:06.770 --> 02:01:06.780 align:start position:0%
that specific site so that's kind of
 
02:01:08.390 --> 02:01:08.400 align:start position:0%
what I have envisioned
 
02:01:08.400 --> 02:01:09.890 align:start position:0%
what I have envisioned
um

02:01:09.890 --> 02:01:09.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:13.070 --> 02:01:13.080 align:start position:0%
um so it would be at the
 
02:01:15.709 --> 02:01:15.719 align:start position:0%
I guess to answer your question it would
 
02:01:15.719 --> 02:01:17.149 align:start position:0%
I guess to answer your question it would
be

02:01:17.149 --> 02:01:17.159 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:01:19.729 --> 02:01:19.739 align:start position:0%
at these
 
02:01:21.350 --> 02:01:21.360 align:start position:0%
state level
 
02:01:24.709 --> 02:01:24.719 align:start position:0%
and and obviously it would have to be
 
02:01:27.770 --> 02:01:27.780 align:start position:0%
allowed in all of the
 
02:01:29.870 --> 02:01:29.880 align:start position:0%
the levels I guess
 
02:01:31.910 --> 02:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
it would have to be allowed like that
 
02:01:33.589 --> 02:01:33.599 align:start position:0%
type of building would have to be
 
02:01:36.649 --> 02:01:36.659 align:start position:0%
allowed I guess in all like you wouldn't
 
02:01:38.089 --> 02:01:38.099 align:start position:0%
be able to build something that's not
 
02:01:40.250 --> 02:01:40.260 align:start position:0%
prohibited by a federal law right that
 
02:01:41.530 --> 02:01:41.540 align:start position:0%
would be
 
02:01:45.589 --> 02:01:45.599 align:start position:0%
that would be weird okay
 
02:01:47.530 --> 02:01:47.540 align:start position:0%
is there
 
02:01:50.270 --> 02:01:50.280 align:start position:0%
specific language that we can put
 
02:01:52.310 --> 02:01:52.320 align:start position:0%
together so I'm thinking I'm happy to do
 
02:01:55.129 --> 02:01:55.139 align:start position:0%
the sub subcommittee on it I I tried to
 
02:01:58.070 --> 02:01:58.080 align:start position:0%
get language but I have not got the the
 
02:02:02.089 --> 02:02:02.099 align:start position:0%
like how did they actually do this you
 
02:02:05.390 --> 02:02:05.400 align:start position:0%
know receiving of the of the plans
 
02:02:08.689 --> 02:02:08.699 align:start position:0%
approval of the plans and how did they
 
02:02:11.570 --> 02:02:11.580 align:start position:0%
um work that in with these other kind of
 
02:02:13.550 --> 02:02:13.560 align:start position:0%
plans for the you know the drainage and
 
02:02:15.169 --> 02:02:15.179 align:start position:0%
the footings and all of that stuff how
 
02:02:16.729 --> 02:02:16.739 align:start position:0%
did all of that interplay and other
 
02:02:18.950 --> 02:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
municipality or end of their states or
 
02:02:21.649 --> 02:02:21.659 align:start position:0%
whoever has also done that
 
02:02:24.050 --> 02:02:24.060 align:start position:0%
um so I wasn't able to
 
02:02:26.750 --> 02:02:26.760 align:start position:0%
create anything yet but I have the
 
02:02:29.030 --> 02:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
researcher you know the OLS researchers
 
02:02:31.189 --> 02:02:31.199 align:start position:0%
looking for that language and then I
 
02:02:34.430 --> 02:02:34.440 align:start position:0%
plan on developing it yeah over the over
 
02:02:35.810 --> 02:02:35.820 align:start position:0%
the would you like to put together a
 
02:02:37.310 --> 02:02:37.320 align:start position:0%
small committee on that to look into
 
02:02:39.830 --> 02:02:39.840 align:start position:0%
that and I'm I'm act yeah that's fine
 
02:02:42.470 --> 02:02:42.480 align:start position:0%
okay is would you like to be a part of
 
02:02:44.390 --> 02:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
that okay so representative Lorenzo
 
02:02:46.129 --> 02:02:46.139 align:start position:0%
representative can you guys work
 
02:02:47.510 --> 02:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
together I'll have you chair it
 
02:02:50.330 --> 02:02:50.340 align:start position:0%
representative okay call call a meeting
 
02:02:52.010 --> 02:02:52.020 align:start position:0%
before the first week of September so
 
02:02:54.470 --> 02:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
that we can kind of get some language
 
02:02:56.990 --> 02:02:57.000 align:start position:0%
um get just okay
 
02:02:59.089 --> 02:02:59.099 align:start position:0%
okay so you just like I said you need 24
 
02:03:01.129 --> 02:03:01.139 align:start position:0%
hours to call a meeting so okay does
 
02:03:02.990 --> 02:03:03.000 align:start position:0%
anybody else want to be a part of it
 
02:03:06.109 --> 02:03:06.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:07.850 --> 02:03:07.860 align:start position:0%
I have a question um I'm gonna
 
02:03:09.169 --> 02:03:09.179 align:start position:0%
representative McConkey then
 
02:03:09.179 --> 02:03:10.430 align:start position:0%
representative McConkey then
representative

02:03:10.430 --> 02:03:10.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:03:13.790 --> 02:03:13.800 align:start position:0%
so um I I like what you're you're going
 
02:03:15.410 --> 02:03:15.420 align:start position:0%
for there I believe during the
 
02:03:18.649 --> 02:03:18.659 align:start position:0%
conversation when we talked about
 
02:03:22.370 --> 02:03:22.380 align:start position:0%
um 3D but modular in manufactured
 
02:03:26.030 --> 02:03:26.040 align:start position:0%
housing that already has a standard that
 
02:03:28.250 --> 02:03:28.260 align:start position:0%
meets fire safety design and health
 
02:03:28.260 --> 02:03:29.450 align:start position:0%
meets fire safety design and health
standards

02:03:29.450 --> 02:03:29.460 align:start position:0%
standards
 
02:03:31.669 --> 02:03:31.679 align:start position:0%
if if you're Pro and you're going to see
 
02:03:33.589 --> 02:03:33.599 align:start position:0%
more and more of that and I've seen in
 
02:03:34.850 --> 02:03:34.860 align:start position:0%
some of those cities you're talking
 
02:03:38.450 --> 02:03:38.460 align:start position:0%
about infill and so forth so I I think
 
02:03:40.669 --> 02:03:40.679 align:start position:0%
you I think you're you're going to find
 
02:03:42.830 --> 02:03:42.840 align:start position:0%
that you're going to need some sort of
 
02:03:45.350 --> 02:03:45.360 align:start position:0%
federal standard that's accepted whether
 
02:03:47.629 --> 02:03:47.639 align:start position:0%
it's the HUD seal or whatever it is and
 
02:03:50.030 --> 02:03:50.040 align:start position:0%
and I totally agree and then at that
 
02:03:54.290 --> 02:03:54.300 align:start position:0%
point when we in rural areas when when
 
02:03:54.300 --> 02:03:56.510 align:start position:0%
point when we in rural areas when when
um

02:03:56.510 --> 02:03:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:59.450 --> 02:03:59.460 align:start position:0%
um a GC modulars and that sort of thing
 
02:04:01.490 --> 02:04:01.500 align:start position:0%
so the plans when they go the building
 
02:04:04.070 --> 02:04:04.080 align:start position:0%
department stamps are already on and the
 
02:04:06.229 --> 02:04:06.239 align:start position:0%
review stops and then we come back now
 
02:04:07.790 --> 02:04:07.800 align:start position:0%
to what where it's going to be on site
 
02:04:10.910 --> 02:04:10.920 align:start position:0%
and Zoning so I think it's a great idea
 
02:04:13.070 --> 02:04:13.080 align:start position:0%
and uh but I think you're going to have
 
02:04:15.649 --> 02:04:15.659 align:start position:0%
to tie it to some higher providing it
 
02:04:18.109 --> 02:04:18.119 align:start position:0%
meets that standard you you move forward
 
02:04:18.119 --> 02:04:20.089 align:start position:0%
meets that standard you you move forward
quicker

02:04:20.089 --> 02:04:20.099 align:start position:0%
quicker
 
02:04:22.310 --> 02:04:22.320 align:start position:0%
so he's saying start at the federal
 
02:04:22.320 --> 02:04:23.390 align:start position:0%
so he's saying start at the federal
level

02:04:23.390 --> 02:04:23.400 align:start position:0%
level
 
02:04:25.750 --> 02:04:25.760 align:start position:0%
and work your way down is that correct
 
02:04:29.149 --> 02:04:29.159 align:start position:0%
yeah so when I when I the pre-approval
 
02:04:31.010 --> 02:04:31.020 align:start position:0%
for multi-family Housing Development
 
02:04:34.310 --> 02:04:34.320 align:start position:0%
meets Federal safety uh Health standards
 
02:04:36.290 --> 02:04:36.300 align:start position:0%
I think you're going to find to do that
 
02:04:39.050 --> 02:04:39.060 align:start position:0%
you're going to need some higher
 
02:04:41.930 --> 02:04:41.940 align:start position:0%
certification or this or the state
 
02:04:44.570 --> 02:04:44.580 align:start position:0%
develops what that standard is but well
 
02:04:47.089 --> 02:04:47.099 align:start position:0%
I I think it'd be valuable to connect
 
02:04:48.709 --> 02:04:48.719 align:start position:0%
with Ben frost on this because he'll
 
02:04:50.089 --> 02:04:50.099 align:start position:0%
probably have an idea of that stuff so
 
02:04:52.250 --> 02:04:52.260 align:start position:0%
maybe he's probably listening right now
 
02:04:52.260 --> 02:04:54.290 align:start position:0%
maybe he's probably listening right now
so

02:04:54.290 --> 02:04:54.300 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:04:57.129 --> 02:04:57.139 align:start position:0%
then wherever you are shoot us an email
 
02:04:59.990 --> 02:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
I have a question I think representative
 
02:05:02.629 --> 02:05:02.639 align:start position:0%
Gibbs might be interested in that aspect
 
02:05:04.010 --> 02:05:04.020 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
02:05:04.020 --> 02:05:04.850 align:start position:0%
okay so
um

02:05:04.850 --> 02:05:04.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:06.950 --> 02:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
I would be happy if you'd like to reach
 
02:05:08.390 --> 02:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
out we'll put her on that committee as
 
02:05:10.850 --> 02:05:10.860 align:start position:0%
well okay representative Reed I have a
 
02:05:13.189 --> 02:05:13.199 align:start position:0%
question and I think we loosened
 
02:05:13.199 --> 02:05:14.930 align:start position:0%
question and I think we loosened
requirements

02:05:14.930 --> 02:05:14.940 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
02:05:17.570 --> 02:05:17.580 align:start position:0%
um for remote meetings of this sort not
 
02:05:20.570 --> 02:05:20.580 align:start position:0%
public hearings but no so would we not
 
02:05:22.070 --> 02:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
be able to do a subcommittee remotely
 
02:05:24.410 --> 02:05:24.420 align:start position:0%
over the summer no it's just um it's
 
02:05:28.070 --> 02:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
it's state boards okay all right
 
02:05:31.129 --> 02:05:31.139 align:start position:0%
um I if we're done with that like number
 
02:05:34.609 --> 02:05:34.619 align:start position:0%
uh eight I would like to bring up number
 
02:05:34.619 --> 02:05:36.229 align:start position:0%
uh eight I would like to bring up number
seven

02:05:36.229 --> 02:05:36.239 align:start position:0%
seven
 
02:05:40.010 --> 02:05:40.020 align:start position:0%
I I would love to see something but I'm
 
02:05:41.689 --> 02:05:41.699 align:start position:0%
you know not willing to just do it all
 
02:05:43.189 --> 02:05:43.199 align:start position:0%
on my own but I would love to see
 
02:05:45.169 --> 02:05:45.179 align:start position:0%
something that
 
02:05:49.609 --> 02:05:49.619 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:52.250 --> 02:05:52.260 align:start position:0%
um above you know whatever to allow tiny
 
02:05:53.930 --> 02:05:53.940 align:start position:0%
homes or small starter homes more
 
02:05:55.910 --> 02:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
affordable homes
 
02:05:57.589 --> 02:05:57.599 align:start position:0%
um I would love to see something along
 
02:05:58.970 --> 02:05:58.980 align:start position:0%
those minimum square footage
 
02:06:00.709 --> 02:06:00.719 align:start position:0%
requirements the minimum square footage
 
02:06:02.870 --> 02:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
requirements so that towns cannot say
 
02:06:04.850 --> 02:06:04.860 align:start position:0%
you have to build something over 2 000
 
02:06:11.089 --> 02:06:11.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:13.430 --> 02:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
is there
 
02:06:16.189 --> 02:06:16.199 align:start position:0%
I it depends on
 
02:06:18.109 --> 02:06:18.119 align:start position:0%
me personally it depends on what that
 
02:06:20.570 --> 02:06:20.580 align:start position:0%
square footage looks like before I could
 
02:06:22.609 --> 02:06:22.619 align:start position:0%
personally get on board with it so
 
02:06:24.410 --> 02:06:24.420 align:start position:0%
um what about does everybody I would
 
02:06:26.990 --> 02:06:27.000 align:start position:0%
kick in my ideas around on that too I'm
 
02:06:28.669 --> 02:06:28.679 align:start position:0%
okay kicking the ideas around I just
 
02:06:30.770 --> 02:06:30.780 align:start position:0%
don't want to make it too too onerous on
 
02:06:34.970 --> 02:06:34.980 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:37.669 --> 02:06:37.679 align:start position:0%
I want to give them the flexibility
 
02:06:40.070 --> 02:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
as much as possible you have a number in
 
02:06:41.810 --> 02:06:41.820 align:start position:0%
mind you have too many too many with
 
02:06:43.669 --> 02:06:43.679 align:start position:0%
lights on
 
02:06:45.169 --> 02:06:45.179 align:start position:0%
too many people with lights on I don't
 
02:06:46.790 --> 02:06:46.800 align:start position:0%
have a number I don't have a number in
 
02:06:46.800 --> 02:06:47.570 align:start position:0%
have a number I don't have a number in
mind

02:06:47.570 --> 02:06:47.580 align:start position:0%
mind
 
02:06:47.580 --> 02:06:53.530 align:start position:0%
mind
okay

02:06:53.530 --> 02:06:53.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:56.450 --> 02:06:56.460 align:start position:0%
answer the question does anybody have
 
02:06:59.870 --> 02:06:59.880 align:start position:0%
any number representative color
 
02:07:03.410 --> 02:07:03.420 align:start position:0%
um so obviously my my amendment that I
 
02:07:07.129 --> 02:07:07.139 align:start position:0%
already talked about HP into HB 13 or
 
02:07:11.030 --> 02:07:11.040 align:start position:0%
313 already was kind of
 
02:07:15.350 --> 02:07:15.360 align:start position:0%
trying to get them to adopt uh
 
02:07:16.970 --> 02:07:16.980 align:start position:0%
a good
 
02:07:16.980 --> 02:07:18.649 align:start position:0%
a good
standard

02:07:18.649 --> 02:07:18.659 align:start position:0%
standard
 
02:07:20.629 --> 02:07:20.639 align:start position:0%
um are you talking about kind of doing
 
02:07:23.629 --> 02:07:23.639 align:start position:0%
the opposite and saying hey if you don't
 
02:07:27.229 --> 02:07:27.239 align:start position:0%
want to be a housing Champion you can't
 
02:07:30.169 --> 02:07:30.179 align:start position:0%
have a lot requirement of a hundred
 
02:07:33.649 --> 02:07:33.659 align:start position:0%
acres and a building size requirement of
 
02:07:37.149 --> 02:07:37.159 align:start position:0%
one thousand square feet minimum
 
02:07:39.709 --> 02:07:39.719 align:start position:0%
what if we just Loop that language into
 
02:07:41.930 --> 02:07:41.940 align:start position:0%
this housing Champion stuff so that way
 
02:07:43.550 --> 02:07:43.560 align:start position:0%
it's not a requirement but if you want
 
02:07:44.810 --> 02:07:44.820 align:start position:0%
to be a housing Champion you can't
 
02:07:47.089 --> 02:07:47.099 align:start position:0%
require more than this amount in a
 
02:07:49.189 --> 02:07:49.199 align:start position:0%
single family zoned area
 
02:07:50.629 --> 02:07:50.639 align:start position:0%
does that make sense why don't we add
 
02:07:52.609 --> 02:07:52.619 align:start position:0%
the square foot into the
 
02:07:54.589 --> 02:07:54.599 align:start position:0%
housing Champion language clarification
 
02:07:57.490 --> 02:07:57.500 align:start position:0%
well isn't the hair square foot
 
02:08:00.070 --> 02:08:00.080 align:start position:0%
you have a lot
 
02:08:02.510 --> 02:08:02.520 align:start position:0%
line 15.
 
02:08:04.189 --> 02:08:04.199 align:start position:0%
shall not require minimum sizes for
 
02:08:07.189 --> 02:08:07.199 align:start position:0%
structures good point it's already done
 
02:08:09.709 --> 02:08:09.719 align:start position:0%
okay so then
 
02:08:12.229 --> 02:08:12.239 align:start position:0%
that's what I was going for so okay that
 
02:08:14.810 --> 02:08:14.820 align:start position:0%
makes sense I mean to be fair I kind of
 
02:08:17.149 --> 02:08:17.159 align:start position:0%
like so many of the ideas out of the 313
 
02:08:18.290 --> 02:08:18.300 align:start position:0%
that we've talked about I kind of just
 
02:08:20.629 --> 02:08:20.639 align:start position:0%
want to make them their own bills for
 
02:08:22.310 --> 02:08:22.320 align:start position:0%
towns but I understand you want to be
 
02:08:25.250 --> 02:08:25.260 align:start position:0%
nice to the towns I mean I'm happy with
 
02:08:27.890 --> 02:08:27.900 align:start position:0%
doing a bill you know I'm I'm happy with
 
02:08:29.570 --> 02:08:29.580 align:start position:0%
co-sponsoring your bill to mandate all
 
02:08:31.550 --> 02:08:31.560 align:start position:0%
of this but I'm also want this to pass
 
02:08:35.890 --> 02:08:35.900 align:start position:0%
so I I want that's why I have this bill
 
02:08:38.629 --> 02:08:38.639 align:start position:0%
well again representative Yokel is the
 
02:08:40.430 --> 02:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
voice of reason
 
02:08:41.870 --> 02:08:41.880 align:start position:0%
um does anybody have any would you like
 
02:08:44.270 --> 02:08:44.280 align:start position:0%
to contribute on on that one that yeah
 
02:08:46.010 --> 02:08:46.020 align:start position:0%
if you added into the housing Champion
 
02:08:48.709 --> 02:08:48.719 align:start position:0%
it I don't I'm I'm intrigued about the
 
02:08:49.910 --> 02:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
housing Champion thing I have no
 
02:08:52.370 --> 02:08:52.380 align:start position:0%
objection to that I just did I just did
 
02:08:54.350 --> 02:08:54.360 align:start position:0%
want to mention a reality and when if we
 
02:08:56.510 --> 02:08:56.520 align:start position:0%
start looking at lot sizes and house
 
02:08:58.430 --> 02:08:58.440 align:start position:0%
sizes and I don't even think we have a
 
02:09:00.350 --> 02:09:00.360 align:start position:0%
lot minimum I mean a house size minimum
 
02:09:03.109 --> 02:09:03.119 align:start position:0%
we might uh and it's we did a study
 
02:09:04.910 --> 02:09:04.920 align:start position:0%
about 15 years ago I didn't bother going
 
02:09:07.550 --> 02:09:07.560 align:start position:0%
to get it uh because the numbers are so
 
02:09:09.950 --> 02:09:09.960 align:start position:0%
far outdated now but believe it or not
 
02:09:11.390 --> 02:09:11.400 align:start position:0%
it in hooks that we established the
 
02:09:13.490 --> 02:09:13.500 align:start position:0%
planning department did it on their own
 
02:09:15.050 --> 02:09:15.060 align:start position:0%
um because this obviously what we're
 
02:09:17.209 --> 02:09:17.219 align:start position:0%
debating now has been talked about for
 
02:09:19.129 --> 02:09:19.139 align:start position:0%
free for decades
 
02:09:21.410 --> 02:09:21.420 align:start position:0%
there is actually a threshold in the
 
02:09:24.589 --> 02:09:24.599 align:start position:0%
value of a home where it actually the
 
02:09:26.510 --> 02:09:26.520 align:start position:0%
revenues taken in from the property are
 
02:09:28.010 --> 02:09:28.020 align:start position:0%
actually black and a little bit of a
 
02:09:30.050 --> 02:09:30.060 align:start position:0%
bonus to the town and below that
 
02:09:32.450 --> 02:09:32.460 align:start position:0%
threshold if I remember correctly for
 
02:09:34.609 --> 02:09:34.619 align:start position:0%
every dollar taken in Revenue it costs a
 
02:09:36.470 --> 02:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
town a dollar Seventeen to provide all
 
02:09:37.910 --> 02:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
the services so I mean these are
 
02:09:39.470 --> 02:09:39.480 align:start position:0%
realities that are there and it's some
 
02:09:41.089 --> 02:09:41.099 align:start position:0%
of the pushback you're going to get if
 
02:09:43.669 --> 02:09:43.679 align:start position:0%
we start going down the road of moving
 
02:09:46.609 --> 02:09:46.619 align:start position:0%
of the bar if you will just those and
 
02:09:47.810 --> 02:09:47.820 align:start position:0%
I'm sure we're not the only Town that's
 
02:09:50.149 --> 02:09:50.159 align:start position:0%
actually has looked at this before so I
 
02:09:51.770 --> 02:09:51.780 align:start position:0%
would see that probably that
 
02:09:56.930 --> 02:09:56.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:59.030 --> 02:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
in this language in the housing the
 
02:10:00.709 --> 02:10:00.719 align:start position:0%
housing Champion certification if you
 
02:10:02.089 --> 02:10:02.099 align:start position:0%
want to if you want to provide
 
02:10:05.089 --> 02:10:05.099 align:start position:0%
additional guidance the the mandating on
 
02:10:06.350 --> 02:10:06.360 align:start position:0%
municipalities I'd like to stay away
 
02:10:08.270 --> 02:10:08.280 align:start position:0%
from as much as possible but if you
 
02:10:09.890 --> 02:10:09.900 align:start position:0%
would like to put that bill into I'm
 
02:10:13.609 --> 02:10:13.619 align:start position:0%
sure you will so go ahead I mean we we
 
02:10:15.169 --> 02:10:15.179 align:start position:0%
kind of talked about like we were
 
02:10:17.689 --> 02:10:17.699 align:start position:0%
talking about the um
 
02:10:20.870 --> 02:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
the commercially zoned
 
02:10:23.410 --> 02:10:23.420 align:start position:0%
um residential stuff I was I was
 
02:10:26.870 --> 02:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
considering just adding one of these
 
02:10:28.370 --> 02:10:28.380 align:start position:0%
things in here
 
02:10:31.010 --> 02:10:31.020 align:start position:0%
um into this housing Champion that said
 
02:10:35.750 --> 02:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
that um that they allow residential by
 
02:10:38.089 --> 02:10:38.099 align:start position:0%
right in all the zones and that would
 
02:10:40.609 --> 02:10:40.619 align:start position:0%
qualify them for the housing Champion
 
02:10:43.250 --> 02:10:43.260 align:start position:0%
thing too also and so that we
 
02:10:46.490 --> 02:10:46.500 align:start position:0%
we can we can reach that happy place
 
02:10:50.030 --> 02:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
again with that that um
 
02:10:52.609 --> 02:10:52.619 align:start position:0%
instead of uh because it sounded like
 
02:10:54.109 --> 02:10:54.119 align:start position:0%
you were not not in favor of the
 
02:10:56.510 --> 02:10:56.520 align:start position:0%
mandating it but but maybe as part of
 
02:10:58.370 --> 02:10:58.380 align:start position:0%
the housing Champion thing you would be
 
02:10:59.930 --> 02:10:59.940 align:start position:0%
fine with it so
 
02:11:02.629 --> 02:11:02.639 align:start position:0%
I I feel like this this uh idea is a
 
02:11:02.639 --> 02:11:03.589 align:start position:0%
I I feel like this this uh idea is a
winner

02:11:03.589 --> 02:11:03.599 align:start position:0%
winner
 
02:11:06.530 --> 02:11:06.540 align:start position:0%
great representative Reed I just wanna
 
02:11:09.830 --> 02:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
for the record clarify that if I were to
 
02:11:12.950 --> 02:11:12.960 align:start position:0%
work on language to mandate towns that I
 
02:11:15.370 --> 02:11:15.380 align:start position:0%
would be more nuanced than simply saying
 
02:11:18.290 --> 02:11:18.300 align:start position:0%
no structure minimum sizes I would say
 
02:11:20.810 --> 02:11:20.820 align:start position:0%
like maybe areas that were tiny home
 
02:11:23.810 --> 02:11:23.820 align:start position:0%
friendly for example but you know I
 
02:11:25.669 --> 02:11:25.679 align:start position:0%
would I would do more than just say
 
02:11:25.679 --> 02:11:28.609 align:start position:0%
would I would do more than just say
nothing

02:11:28.609 --> 02:11:28.619 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:30.410 --> 02:11:30.420 align:start position:0%
so um
 
02:11:32.390 --> 02:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
I have I have I'll put this all together
 
02:11:34.609 --> 02:11:34.619 align:start position:0%
in an email so number one representative
 
02:11:36.830 --> 02:11:36.840 align:start position:0%
Reed you're the point person for this I
 
02:11:39.290 --> 02:11:39.300 align:start position:0%
don't see us needing yep I don't see us
 
02:11:40.790 --> 02:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
needing to talk about this until the
 
02:11:43.129 --> 02:11:43.139 align:start position:0%
first week of September number two I'll
 
02:11:45.770 --> 02:11:45.780 align:start position:0%
be the point person I'll connect with um
 
02:11:47.030 --> 02:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
the housing appeals board people and
 
02:11:48.470 --> 02:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
make sure we can get language that would
 
02:11:51.950 --> 02:11:51.960 align:start position:0%
expand the appeal process to allow for
 
02:11:55.070 --> 02:11:55.080 align:start position:0%
um on unfair or or unreasonable or
 
02:11:57.109 --> 02:11:57.119 align:start position:0%
perceived unreasonable
 
02:12:01.129 --> 02:12:01.139 align:start position:0%
um rulings by state or local Health fire
 
02:12:03.410 --> 02:12:03.420 align:start position:0%
um or Heritage commission Des all these
 
02:12:06.169 --> 02:12:06.179 align:start position:0%
things allow people process through the
 
02:12:08.810 --> 02:12:08.820 align:start position:0%
hab or the Circuit Court
 
02:12:11.750 --> 02:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
the land review docket number three
 
02:12:13.310 --> 02:12:13.320 align:start position:0%
representative McConkey is going to send
 
02:12:14.930 --> 02:12:14.940 align:start position:0%
us language on
 
02:12:17.030 --> 02:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
um Des
 
02:12:20.750 --> 02:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:22.910 --> 02:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
um who was looking into that Municipal
 
02:12:22.920 --> 02:12:24.229 align:start position:0%
um who was looking into that Municipal
inspections

02:12:24.229 --> 02:12:24.239 align:start position:0%
inspections
 
02:12:28.850 --> 02:12:28.860 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:30.890 --> 02:12:30.900 align:start position:0%
or you're looking into so do we not want
 
02:12:33.589 --> 02:12:33.599 align:start position:0%
to touch that right now
 
02:12:35.570 --> 02:12:35.580 align:start position:0%
I didn't take no
 
02:12:35.580 --> 02:12:38.330 align:start position:0%
I didn't take no
um

02:12:38.330 --> 02:12:38.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:40.609 --> 02:12:40.619 align:start position:0%
I mean Municipal inspections my thing
 
02:12:43.070 --> 02:12:43.080 align:start position:0%
was kind of the pre-approval thing it's
 
02:12:45.649 --> 02:12:45.659 align:start position:0%
a little bit of streamlining the process
 
02:12:47.510 --> 02:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
because then if it was pre-approved then
 
02:12:49.430 --> 02:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't have to right so we'll
 
02:12:52.129 --> 02:12:52.139 align:start position:0%
probably we'll combine that with the
 
02:12:55.330 --> 02:12:55.340 align:start position:0%
pre-approval and I'll foreign
 
02:12:58.609 --> 02:12:58.619 align:start position:0%
Delorenzo representative Gibbs on that
 
02:12:58.619 --> 02:13:00.589 align:start position:0%
Delorenzo representative Gibbs on that
um

02:13:00.589 --> 02:13:00.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:13:03.890 --> 02:13:03.900 align:start position:0%
number six we've dealt with
 
02:13:05.689 --> 02:13:05.699 align:start position:0%
number seven square footage requirement
 
02:13:07.550 --> 02:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with in the um housing
 
02:13:10.129 --> 02:13:10.139 align:start position:0%
Champion language and then number nine
 
02:13:12.470 --> 02:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
impact fees I'll put together some
 
02:13:14.149 --> 02:13:14.159 align:start position:0%
language on
 
02:13:16.250 --> 02:13:16.260 align:start position:0%
um allowing a municipality to extend the
 
02:13:17.930 --> 02:13:17.940 align:start position:0%
impact fees over a certain amount of
 
02:13:17.940 --> 02:13:19.370 align:start position:0%
impact fees over a certain amount of
time

02:13:19.370 --> 02:13:19.380 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:13:21.290 --> 02:13:21.300 align:start position:0%
um and charge reasonable interest and
 
02:13:24.410 --> 02:13:24.420 align:start position:0%
administrative fees so that will allow a
 
02:13:26.089 --> 02:13:26.099 align:start position:0%
developer the flexibility of paying
 
02:13:28.790 --> 02:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
those upfront or
 
02:13:30.410 --> 02:13:30.420 align:start position:0%
um spreading it out over a 20 up to
 
02:13:32.750 --> 02:13:32.760 align:start position:0%
20-year process
 
02:13:32.760 --> 02:13:34.069 align:start position:0%
20-year process
okay

02:13:34.069 --> 02:13:34.079 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:13:37.970 --> 02:13:37.980 align:start position:0%
is there anything else that we need to
 
02:13:39.770 --> 02:13:39.780 align:start position:0%
talk about before we break for the
 
02:13:39.780 --> 02:13:44.149 align:start position:0%
talk about before we break for the
summer

02:13:44.149 --> 02:13:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:46.310 --> 02:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
did I miss you saying who's doing the
 
02:13:49.069 --> 02:13:49.079 align:start position:0%
follow-up on impact fees that's me
 
02:13:51.770 --> 02:13:51.780 align:start position:0%
yep I'll take care of that
 
02:13:54.109 --> 02:13:54.119 align:start position:0%
representative we didn't
 
02:13:56.990 --> 02:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
um we didn't really talk about the D.O.T
 
02:13:59.569 --> 02:13:59.579 align:start position:0%
um standard stuff did we
 
02:14:01.910 --> 02:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
is anyone did
 
02:14:04.550 --> 02:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
did we skip that on purpose or are we
 
02:14:06.229 --> 02:14:06.239 align:start position:0%
um is anyone interested in that I guess
 
02:14:08.330 --> 02:14:08.340 align:start position:0%
yeah I didn't understand
 
02:14:10.129 --> 02:14:10.139 align:start position:0%
um I didn't remember that conversation
 
02:14:12.410 --> 02:14:12.420 align:start position:0%
as well as I probably should I think
 
02:14:14.330 --> 02:14:14.340 align:start position:0%
that there was a conversation that a
 
02:14:16.850 --> 02:14:16.860 align:start position:0%
developer made about how
 
02:14:19.010 --> 02:14:19.020 align:start position:0%
there need to be two sidewalks or
 
02:14:21.470 --> 02:14:21.480 align:start position:0%
something on a road I think that they
 
02:14:24.109 --> 02:14:24.119 align:start position:0%
were suggesting that
 
02:14:24.119 --> 02:14:25.030 align:start position:0%
were suggesting that
um

02:14:25.030 --> 02:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:30.410 --> 02:14:30.420 align:start position:0%
that d e d o t has some
 
02:14:36.229 --> 02:14:36.239 align:start position:0%
guidance that often is just adopted
 
02:14:39.109 --> 02:14:39.119 align:start position:0%
wholesale at the local level
 
02:14:43.310 --> 02:14:43.320 align:start position:0%
um and for inappropriate roads
 
02:14:45.950 --> 02:14:45.960 align:start position:0%
like you know a cul-de-sac or something
 
02:14:45.960 --> 02:14:48.189 align:start position:0%
like you know a cul-de-sac or something
being

02:14:48.189 --> 02:14:48.199 align:start position:0%
being
 
02:14:50.810 --> 02:14:50.820 align:start position:0%
built to you know Highway standards
 
02:14:50.820 --> 02:14:52.609 align:start position:0%
built to you know Highway standards
essentially

02:14:52.609 --> 02:14:52.619 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
02:14:55.970 --> 02:14:55.980 align:start position:0%
um right and just because it was adopted
 
02:14:55.980 --> 02:14:57.050 align:start position:0%
um right and just because it was adopted
wholesale

02:14:57.050 --> 02:14:57.060 align:start position:0%
wholesale
 
02:15:01.010 --> 02:15:01.020 align:start position:0%
um at the at the local level and maybe
 
02:15:01.020 --> 02:15:01.850 align:start position:0%
um at the at the local level and maybe
um

02:15:01.850 --> 02:15:01.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:06.069 --> 02:15:06.079 align:start position:0%
trying to find some lower level
 
02:15:08.810 --> 02:15:08.820 align:start position:0%
recommendations for that
 
02:15:12.010 --> 02:15:12.020 align:start position:0%
um for those side or ancillary streets
 
02:15:15.290 --> 02:15:15.300 align:start position:0%
that municipalities or encourage them to
 
02:15:17.629 --> 02:15:17.639 align:start position:0%
adopt you know lower standards for those
 
02:15:20.209 --> 02:15:20.219 align:start position:0%
ancillary streets instead of the highway
 
02:15:22.729 --> 02:15:22.739 align:start position:0%
standards so I think that is something
 
02:15:25.189 --> 02:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
that we can Loop in with the hab and say
 
02:15:27.709 --> 02:15:27.719 align:start position:0%
if if you disagree with
 
02:15:30.770 --> 02:15:30.780 align:start position:0%
that guidance for that specific
 
02:15:32.990 --> 02:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
area you can appeal it
 
02:15:35.510 --> 02:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
through the hab
 
02:15:37.250 --> 02:15:37.260 align:start position:0%
you know representative Washington yeah
 
02:15:38.390 --> 02:15:38.400 align:start position:0%
thank you if I remember right that was
 
02:15:40.310 --> 02:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
kind of an afterthought from The God Who
 
02:15:42.470 --> 02:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
giving us the presentation that day I
 
02:15:43.490 --> 02:15:43.500 align:start position:0%
think it was even during the question
 
02:15:45.709 --> 02:15:45.719 align:start position:0%
and answer period that's fine we can
 
02:15:47.810 --> 02:15:47.820 align:start position:0%
look at it uh I'll even take a look at
 
02:15:49.550 --> 02:15:49.560 align:start position:0%
it as far as our requirements I don't
 
02:15:51.589 --> 02:15:51.599 align:start position:0%
know what other towns are doing
 
02:15:54.410 --> 02:15:54.420 align:start position:0%
but the reason they do make it easy and
 
02:15:56.709 --> 02:15:56.719 align:start position:0%
I'm sure it's not interstate highway
 
02:15:59.569 --> 02:15:59.579 align:start position:0%
standards that they're applying
 
02:16:01.370 --> 02:16:01.380 align:start position:0%
um but that you know after a subdivision
 
02:16:02.990 --> 02:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
is built the town actually has to take
 
02:16:05.750 --> 02:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
ownership of that road and that includes
 
02:16:08.870 --> 02:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
maintenance and replacing it and so
 
02:16:11.569 --> 02:16:11.579 align:start position:0%
that's why you see the the towns going
 
02:16:15.050 --> 02:16:15.060 align:start position:0%
with a pretty strict standardized so I
 
02:16:16.189 --> 02:16:16.199 align:start position:0%
don't know how much we want to look into
 
02:16:18.410 --> 02:16:18.420 align:start position:0%
it but but I'll take a piece and they
 
02:16:20.089 --> 02:16:20.099 align:start position:0%
have to plow it and they want room for
 
02:16:21.830 --> 02:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
the fire engines to go up and be able to
 
02:16:25.629 --> 02:16:25.639 align:start position:0%
turn around so they're a chance
 
02:16:27.770 --> 02:16:27.780 align:start position:0%
and keep in mind it's not just a
 
02:16:29.689 --> 02:16:29.699 align:start position:0%
pavement either with all your substrates
 
02:16:32.330 --> 02:16:32.340 align:start position:0%
a lot of these with curbs and sidewalks
 
02:16:33.589 --> 02:16:33.599 align:start position:0%
now that you've got structures
 
02:16:35.389 --> 02:16:35.399 align:start position:0%
underneath I mean there's a lot to it so
 
02:16:38.570 --> 02:16:38.580 align:start position:0%
okay representative Reed uh tangentially
 
02:16:41.629 --> 02:16:41.639 align:start position:0%
I would ask that representative viokella
 
02:16:43.849 --> 02:16:43.859 align:start position:0%
consider for his uh housing Champions
 
02:16:47.690 --> 02:16:47.700 align:start position:0%
313 to add or just consider adding a
 
02:16:51.849 --> 02:16:51.859 align:start position:0%
piece about walkability and bicycle uh
 
02:16:56.870 --> 02:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
that why are you looking like that
 
02:17:00.530 --> 02:17:00.540 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing that towns can
 
02:17:02.810 --> 02:17:02.820 align:start position:0%
provide makes
 
02:17:05.150 --> 02:17:05.160 align:start position:0%
um housing more livable more housing
 
02:17:06.950 --> 02:17:06.960 align:start position:0%
more livable for people
 
02:17:10.610 --> 02:17:10.620 align:start position:0%
so it's it's just something to consider
 
02:17:12.709 --> 02:17:12.719 align:start position:0%
and we can consider things without the
 
02:17:12.719 --> 02:17:14.169 align:start position:0%
and we can consider things without the
faces

02:17:14.169 --> 02:17:14.179 align:start position:0%
faces
 
02:17:16.549 --> 02:17:16.559 align:start position:0%
representative Walsh
 
02:17:19.549 --> 02:17:19.559 align:start position:0%
well if we're considering things because
 
02:17:21.709 --> 02:17:21.719 align:start position:0%
I know we're looking at affordability
 
02:17:24.650 --> 02:17:24.660 align:start position:0%
especially in terms of Apartments but I
 
02:17:26.330 --> 02:17:26.340 align:start position:0%
did get a call this morning from
 
02:17:28.849 --> 02:17:28.859 align:start position:0%
somebody who was just appointed to the
 
02:17:31.250 --> 02:17:31.260 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle charging station in
 
02:17:33.169 --> 02:17:33.179 align:start position:0%
apartment study committee that's going
 
02:17:35.929 --> 02:17:35.939 align:start position:0%
on so are we looking at affordable
 
02:17:37.849 --> 02:17:37.859 align:start position:0%
apartments as a goal or are we going to
 
02:17:39.770 --> 02:17:39.780 align:start position:0%
start mandating electric vehicle
 
02:17:41.570 --> 02:17:41.580 align:start position:0%
charging stations too because their
 
02:17:43.790 --> 02:17:43.800 align:start position:0%
suggestion was should this committee's
 
02:17:46.009 --> 02:17:46.019 align:start position:0%
topic come to this committee and I said
 
02:17:48.950 --> 02:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
I don't know but it's a good question
 
02:17:51.889 --> 02:17:51.899 align:start position:0%
well I yeah I mean I live in a townhouse
 
02:17:54.169 --> 02:17:54.179 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't I don't have a garage I
 
02:17:56.270 --> 02:17:56.280 align:start position:0%
have no if I want an electric vehicle I
 
02:17:58.490 --> 02:17:58.500 align:start position:0%
wouldn't even know where to put it
 
02:18:02.690 --> 02:18:02.700 align:start position:0%
I don't own that spot either so
 
02:18:04.370 --> 02:18:04.380 align:start position:0%
um okay do you wanna do you want to look
 
02:18:06.830 --> 02:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
further into the the um planning
 
02:18:08.629 --> 02:18:08.639 align:start position:0%
requirements on dot standards
 
02:18:11.810 --> 02:18:11.820 align:start position:0%
representative Walsh all right all right
 
02:18:15.290 --> 02:18:15.300 align:start position:0%
so does that cover everyone
 
02:18:16.969 --> 02:18:16.979 align:start position:0%
um everyone in the committee I'll send
 
02:18:19.009 --> 02:18:19.019 align:start position:0%
I'll send an email in the next day or
 
02:18:20.330 --> 02:18:20.340 align:start position:0%
two that'll kind of outline everything
 
02:18:21.950 --> 02:18:21.960 align:start position:0%
we talked about today
 
02:18:24.169 --> 02:18:24.179 align:start position:0%
is there anything else that anyone would
 
02:18:25.669 --> 02:18:25.679 align:start position:0%
like to look at
 
02:18:27.950 --> 02:18:27.960 align:start position:0%
representative Damon
 
02:18:30.049 --> 02:18:30.059 align:start position:0%
I don't think anybody took the updating
 
02:18:31.849 --> 02:18:31.859 align:start position:0%
the building code I could do some
 
02:18:34.250 --> 02:18:34.260 align:start position:0%
background work on that to see what
 
02:18:36.830 --> 02:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
happens appreciate anybody's input who
 
02:18:38.690 --> 02:18:38.700 align:start position:0%
knows more than I which is everything I
 
02:18:40.070 --> 02:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
believe it's a rule making process I
 
02:18:41.990 --> 02:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
think there's a new code coming out this
 
02:18:44.929 --> 02:18:44.939 align:start position:0%
year there was a seven there's a code in
 
02:18:46.910 --> 02:18:46.920 align:start position:0%
17 right and it's just not even said 17
 
02:18:48.169 --> 02:18:48.179 align:start position:0%
or 18.
 
02:18:54.169 --> 02:18:54.179 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:56.929 --> 02:18:56.939 align:start position:0%
so the uh legislature formalized the
 
02:18:59.209 --> 02:18:59.219 align:start position:0%
building code and other codes updated
 
02:19:02.870 --> 02:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
update process uh I think it was last
 
02:19:02.880 --> 02:19:04.370 align:start position:0%
update process uh I think it was last
year

02:19:04.370 --> 02:19:04.380 align:start position:0%
year
 
02:19:07.549 --> 02:19:07.559 align:start position:0%
um they you all I think finished
 
02:19:10.310 --> 02:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
tweaking that process so essentially for
 
02:19:11.389 --> 02:19:11.399 align:start position:0%
the building code there's the building
 
02:19:14.209 --> 02:19:14.219 align:start position:0%
code review board they look at
 
02:19:16.790 --> 02:19:16.800 align:start position:0%
um the codes come out every three years
 
02:19:19.070 --> 02:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
um so the state is currently the 2018
 
02:19:21.410 --> 02:19:21.420 align:start position:0%
codes our initial codes are 2015.
 
02:19:24.830 --> 02:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
they're looking at the 2021 codes
 
02:19:26.810 --> 02:19:26.820 align:start position:0%
a new code will be coming out from the
 
02:19:28.310 --> 02:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
international code
 
02:19:32.030 --> 02:19:32.040 align:start position:0%
um people but uh the State Building Code
 
02:19:33.830 --> 02:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
review board is looking at the 2021
 
02:19:37.009 --> 02:19:37.019 align:start position:0%
codes suggesting changes
 
02:19:38.570 --> 02:19:38.580 align:start position:0%
um and then that kind of an
 
02:19:41.270 --> 02:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
administrative process continues there
 
02:19:44.030 --> 02:19:44.040 align:start position:0%
will have to be a adoption via vote of
 
02:19:48.049 --> 02:19:48.059 align:start position:0%
the legislature for any updates to that
 
02:19:50.630 --> 02:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
code but presumably it'll be
 
02:19:53.230 --> 02:19:53.240 align:start position:0%
mostly the same as the 2021 codes
 
02:19:55.870 --> 02:19:55.880 align:start position:0%
International codes but with some
 
02:19:58.010 --> 02:19:58.020 align:start position:0%
state-specific tweaks
 
02:19:59.330 --> 02:19:59.340 align:start position:0%
and I can certainly put you in contact
 
02:20:02.030 --> 02:20:02.040 align:start position:0%
with the people who would know way more
 
02:20:04.070 --> 02:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
about that than I do yeah Bill McKinney
 
02:20:05.630 --> 02:20:05.640 align:start position:0%
who presented to us probably would be
 
02:20:07.550 --> 02:20:07.560 align:start position:0%
your best point of contact for that and
 
02:20:09.230 --> 02:20:09.240 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to send or nature can send you
 
02:20:10.790 --> 02:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
his contact information
 
02:20:13.130 --> 02:20:13.140 align:start position:0%
he's the chair of the state New
 
02:20:14.990 --> 02:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire boa or yeah
 
02:20:18.530 --> 02:20:18.540 align:start position:0%
yes yep okay represent Walsh yeah and
 
02:20:20.090 --> 02:20:20.100 align:start position:0%
the fire codes work the same way or
 
02:20:20.100 --> 02:20:21.550 align:start position:0%
the fire codes work the same way or
similarly

02:20:21.550 --> 02:20:21.560 align:start position:0%
similarly
 
02:20:25.250 --> 02:20:25.260 align:start position:0%
nfpa1 is a National Standard we adopt it
 
02:20:26.889 --> 02:20:26.899 align:start position:0%
with our own exceptions
 
02:20:29.570 --> 02:20:29.580 align:start position:0%
after the fact usually we were just on
 
02:20:32.570 --> 02:20:32.580 align:start position:0%
18 I believe and we might have moved up
 
02:20:38.210 --> 02:20:38.220 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:40.370 --> 02:20:40.380 align:start position:0%
all right we have all of our chores for
 
02:20:42.290 --> 02:20:42.300 align:start position:0%
the summer so I hope everybody has a
 
02:20:44.389 --> 02:20:44.399 align:start position:0%
good summer and gets much needed break
 
02:20:46.309 --> 02:20:46.319 align:start position:0%
from the legislature as I will
 
02:20:48.170 --> 02:20:48.180 align:start position:0%
representative Damon
 
02:20:50.270 --> 02:20:50.280 align:start position:0%
so just planning ahead it sounds like we
 
02:20:52.010 --> 02:20:52.020 align:start position:0%
will have a committee meeting in the
 
02:20:53.630 --> 02:20:53.640 align:start position:0%
first week of September plan the first
 
02:20:55.550 --> 02:20:55.560 align:start position:0%
week of September is that meaning Labor
 
02:20:59.330 --> 02:20:59.340 align:start position:0%
Day week that is what
 
02:21:00.969 --> 02:21:00.979 align:start position:0%
what are you laughing about
 
02:21:04.849 --> 02:21:04.859 align:start position:0%
oh yeah no I I I really don't have an
 
02:21:05.990 --> 02:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
intention of doing it the day after
 
02:21:07.550 --> 02:21:07.560 align:start position:0%
Labor Day but
 
02:21:09.170 --> 02:21:09.180 align:start position:0%
um because filing the filing period is
 
02:21:11.349 --> 02:21:11.359 align:start position:0%
the second week of September
 
02:21:14.990 --> 02:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
so it starts September 11th right
 
02:21:18.349 --> 02:21:18.359 align:start position:0%
okay so Labor day is the fourth yeah the
 
02:21:21.230 --> 02:21:21.240 align:start position:0%
filing period starts the Monday after
 
02:21:23.150 --> 02:21:23.160 align:start position:0%
late in the legislation the legislature
 
02:21:25.070 --> 02:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
isn't where you're going to meet so we
 
02:21:26.330 --> 02:21:26.340 align:start position:0%
have flexibility for Wednesday or
 
02:21:28.250 --> 02:21:28.260 align:start position:0%
Thursdays to get together I'm pretty
 
02:21:29.929 --> 02:21:29.939 align:start position:0%
sure there's going to be other committee
 
02:21:34.190 --> 02:21:34.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:34.200 --> 02:22:00.230 align:start position:0%
 
tonight

02:22:00.230 --> 02:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:03.110 --> 02:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
thank you everyone have a good summer
