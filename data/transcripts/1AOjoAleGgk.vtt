00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 align:start position:0%
you all i'm opening the interim study
 
00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.030 align:start position:0%
you all i'm opening the interim study
committee

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 align:start position:0%
meeting on house bill 1229
 
00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 align:start position:0%
which i have affectionately dubbed the s
 
00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 align:start position:0%
interim study on whether or not we
 
00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
should have a study
 
00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 align:start position:0%
that's the way that it's written but i
 
00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 align:start position:0%
want to clarify for those of you that
 
00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:20.949 align:start position:0%
want to clarify for those of you that
are

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 align:start position:0%
watching and with us
 
00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:26.479 align:start position:0%
i'm representative sue mullen from
 
00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 align:start position:0%
bedford i chair this interim study
 
00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 align:start position:0%
with me to my right is representative
 
00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 align:start position:0%
art ellison
 
00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
and to my left representative oliver
 
00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 align:start position:0%
ford two members of the interim study
 
00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:41.199 align:start position:0%
committee as well
 
00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
so when we were looking at
 
00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 align:start position:0%
uh the group of
 
00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
school meal or nutrition related
 
00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:54.639 align:start position:0%
standards bills that we heard
 
00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
this past session
 
00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.070 align:start position:0%
this past session
um

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 align:start position:0%
the question became you know
 
00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
would one of those bills be a vehicle
 
00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
for further study so
 
00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:08.320 align:start position:0%
while it may look like this interim
 
00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 align:start position:0%
study is merely about whether or not we
 
00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:12.479 align:start position:0%
should study this
 
00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.280 align:start position:0%
it actually is the umbrella that we're
 
00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:17.600 align:start position:0%
going to be looking at a variety of
 
00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:18.710 align:start position:0%
going to be looking at a variety of
bills

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
bills
 
00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.230 align:start position:0%
bills
under

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 align:start position:0%
under
 
00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
those bills are house bill 1229 which is
 
00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
the interim study bill
 
00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:28.880 align:start position:0%
house bill 1561
 
00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:34.280 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 align:start position:0%
1657 and house bill 1660 which uh i know
 
00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:42.320 align:start position:0%
you gentlemen have information on that
 
00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:44.320 align:start position:0%
if anybody else wants to
 
00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
look at those bills as we address them
 
00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.360 align:start position:0%
then you're free to
 
00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:51.440 align:start position:0%
grab one of these
 
00:05:56.309 --> 00:05:56.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 align:start position:0%
also in the audience today is
 
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
representative timothy horrigan who is
 
00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor of
 
00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:07.039 align:start position:0%
1229 and also tim of
 
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
our representative horgan of 1660 which
 
00:06:12.309 --> 00:06:12.319 align:start position:0%
was the breakfast bill would you like to
 
00:06:14.309 --> 00:06:14.319 align:start position:0%
come up and just say a couple of words
 
00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
about school meals and
 
00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:19.039 align:start position:0%
sort of what the impetus has been for
 
00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:23.850 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:24.950 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
when i first got about thinking about
 
00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
this relatively
 
00:06:30.309 --> 00:06:30.319 align:start position:0%
recently one wise
 
00:06:32.309 --> 00:06:32.319 align:start position:0%
i've always thought
 
00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
i've always thought that more students
 
00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:35.360 align:start position:0%
should be getting uh
 
00:06:37.189 --> 00:06:37.199 align:start position:0%
all students should be fed at school and
 
00:06:39.029 --> 00:06:39.039 align:start position:0%
if you do it for free that's fine even
 
00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:41.600 align:start position:0%
the relatively affluent families um
 
00:06:43.029 --> 00:06:43.039 align:start position:0%
i don't have a problem
 
00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:44.560 align:start position:0%
problem with that and i especially got
 
00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:46.560 align:start position:0%
thinking of it during the pandemic when
 
00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
in my school district and
 
00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:50.960 align:start position:0%
i think probably
 
00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:53.120 align:start position:0%
just about every other one
 
00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
they uh instituted a free lunch for
 
00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
everybody because the they were going
 
00:06:59.270 --> 00:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
around the school buses were going
 
00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:02.080 align:start position:0%
around everybody's house and delivering
 
00:07:04.309 --> 00:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
it was easier for various reasons to
 
00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:06.560 align:start position:0%
deliver the lunches
 
00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:09.440 align:start position:0%
to everyone along with the instructional
 
00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:10.960 align:start position:0%
materials for
 
00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:13.120 align:start position:0%
several reasons one of which was simply
 
00:07:15.029 --> 00:07:15.039 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
in the interest of confidentialities
 
00:07:18.629 --> 00:07:18.639 align:start position:0%
otherwise the kids would notice like
 
00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:21.360 align:start position:0%
which houses were getting if you limited
 
00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
to just the free reduced uh the free
 
00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
lunch kids the other kids would um
 
00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
definitely notice like who's getting the
 
00:07:29.589 --> 00:07:29.599 align:start position:0%
lunch and who isn't so you know they're
 
00:07:31.749 --> 00:07:31.759 align:start position:0%
very smart about that very clever about
 
00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:34.800 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing you know so um
 
00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
and i also want to make sure the uh
 
00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:38.720 align:start position:0%
school breakfast was uh was it was
 
00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:41.120 align:start position:0%
expanded and so i've been um
 
00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:42.230 align:start position:0%
expanded and so i've been um
hacking

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
hacking
 
00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
i've been like
 
00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
working in that issue for uh for several
 
00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:47.840 align:start position:0%
years without uh with i guess a certain
 
00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
amount of success but we haven't like
 
00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:52.400 align:start position:0%
actually passed anything and um
 
00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:54.080 align:start position:0%
and then other other groups of
 
00:07:55.909 --> 00:07:55.919 align:start position:0%
representatives have similar ideas in
 
00:07:58.629 --> 00:07:58.639 align:start position:0%
there too so that was uh i'm not sure
 
00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:00.560 align:start position:0%
what else more there is no i think it's
 
00:08:02.869 --> 00:08:02.879 align:start position:0%
uh i i think your efforts have been
 
00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:04.720 align:start position:0%
admirable because i think you've kept
 
00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:07.360 align:start position:0%
the issue alive in the eyes of many of
 
00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
us from uh year to year
 
00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:11.360 align:start position:0%
and i
 
00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:13.360 align:start position:0%
i think all of us in looking at these
 
00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:15.440 align:start position:0%
bills are
 
00:08:18.469 --> 00:08:18.479 align:start position:0%
pleased with the bipartisanship that
 
00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:21.680 align:start position:0%
is present on most of them that these uh
 
00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:24.080 align:start position:0%
you know hungry kids are hungry kids
 
00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:25.189 align:start position:0%
you know hungry kids are hungry kids
period

00:08:25.189 --> 00:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
period
 
00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
so i i certainly have admired your
 
00:08:30.869 --> 00:08:30.879 align:start position:0%
efforts on this and uh
 
00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:32.560 align:start position:0%
is there um
 
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
well let me let me let me just go
 
00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:37.360 align:start position:0%
through the process of introducing what
 
00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
we're going to do
 
00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
today next week and then maybe uh if you
 
00:08:43.829 --> 00:08:43.839 align:start position:0%
have further information you want to
 
00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
share with us we'd be happy to have have
 
00:08:46.949 --> 00:08:46.959 align:start position:0%
you come up then
 
00:08:51.269 --> 00:08:51.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:55.269 --> 00:08:55.279 align:start position:0%
all right so 1229 as i mentioned is the
 
00:08:58.070 --> 00:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
study committee bill
 
00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:00.160 align:start position:0%
and as an interim study you know what
 
00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:02.160 align:start position:0%
we're going to be doing is looking at
 
00:09:04.949 --> 00:09:04.959 align:start position:0%
whether or not we are recommending or
 
00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:13.269 --> 00:09:13.279 align:start position:0%
we'll put that aside
 
00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
at this point and maybe at a future date
 
00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
decide whether or not we actually need
 
00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:20.080 align:start position:0%
the study committee or if we're able to
 
00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.269 align:start position:0%
the study committee or if we're able to
study

00:09:21.269 --> 00:09:21.279 align:start position:0%
study
 
00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
the issue without the study committee
 
00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:28.480 align:start position:0%
1561 if we go in chronological order is
 
00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:33.200 align:start position:0%
a school nutrition standards bill
 
00:09:35.509 --> 00:09:35.519 align:start position:0%
we are going to have the department of
 
00:09:35.519 --> 00:09:36.470 align:start position:0%
we are going to have the department of
education

00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
food and nutrition services with us next
 
00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:41.360 align:start position:0%
week at our meeting
 
00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:42.550 align:start position:0%
week at our meeting
so

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:42.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
00:09:46.949 --> 00:09:46.959 align:start position:0%
getting their input and reflection on
 
00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:50.560 align:start position:0%
what was being proposed
 
00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
by uh house bill 1561 would probably be
 
00:09:57.829 --> 00:09:57.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
and perhaps representative deschez will
 
00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:05.120 align:start position:0%
be able to be with us then also
 
00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
15 house bill 1564 is a breakfast build
 
00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
that too
 
00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
came before us
 
00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
and along the same lines as
 
00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
representative oregon 1660 it looks to
 
00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:23.269 align:start position:0%
representative oregon 1660 it looks to
address

00:10:23.269 --> 00:10:23.279 align:start position:0%
address
 
00:10:27.269 --> 00:10:27.279 align:start position:0%
food insecurity and meal needs uh in the
 
00:10:27.279 --> 00:10:28.470 align:start position:0%
food insecurity and meal needs uh in the
morning

00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:28.480 align:start position:0%
morning
 
00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
in addition to
 
00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:33.440 align:start position:0%
just offering the required meal at noon
 
00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:34.470 align:start position:0%
just offering the required meal at noon
time

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
so we'll get some information about that
 
00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:40.069 align:start position:0%
so we'll get some information about that
the

00:10:40.069 --> 00:10:40.079 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:10:40.079 --> 00:10:41.470 align:start position:0%
the
15

00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:41.480 align:start position:0%
15
 
00:10:45.269 --> 00:10:45.279 align:start position:0%
1657 which was the farm to school
 
00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
reimbursement program
 
00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
those folks have been contacted and they
 
00:10:52.389 --> 00:10:52.399 align:start position:0%
have asked
 
00:10:52.399 --> 00:10:53.509 align:start position:0%
have asked
to

00:10:53.509 --> 00:10:53.519 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
meet with us in september as opposed to
 
00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:56.949 align:start position:0%
meet with us in september as opposed to
now

00:10:56.949 --> 00:10:56.959 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:10:58.550 --> 00:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
so that they can pull some additional
 
00:11:00.389 --> 00:11:00.399 align:start position:0%
information together for us
 
00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
so unless anybody has an objection to
 
00:11:05.509 --> 00:11:05.519 align:start position:0%
waiting until september then i think
 
00:11:06.949 --> 00:11:06.959 align:start position:0%
we'll do that
 
00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
and 1660 is
 
00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:11.360 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned representative horgan's
 
00:11:14.069 --> 00:11:14.079 align:start position:0%
breakfast bill so perhaps representative
 
00:11:16.389 --> 00:11:16.399 align:start position:0%
horrigan and representative duchess will
 
00:11:19.269 --> 00:11:19.279 align:start position:0%
be working on one
 
00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:27.829 --> 00:11:27.839 align:start position:0%
if you're both re-elected right if not
 
00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
then we will pass that baton on to
 
00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
whoever is successful and
 
00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
wants to make sure that we don't have
 
00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
school children that go hungry
 
00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:40.160 align:start position:0%
i also
 
00:11:42.389 --> 00:11:42.399 align:start position:0%
have a couple of points of information
 
00:11:46.389 --> 00:11:46.399 align:start position:0%
for us uh i have an outline of
 
00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:48.160 align:start position:0%
topics that we're going to be talking
 
00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
about today
 
00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:51.680 align:start position:0%
if representative ellison if i could get
 
00:11:54.629 --> 00:11:54.639 align:start position:0%
you to hand this to representative hall
 
00:11:58.629 --> 00:11:58.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:01.760 align:start position:0%
an article came out
 
00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
yesterday i believe in
 
00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
a publication called k-12 dive
 
00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.509 align:start position:0%
a publication called k-12 dive
that

00:12:09.509 --> 00:12:09.519 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:12:12.389 --> 00:12:12.399 align:start position:0%
indicates that you the usda is about to
 
00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:15.200 align:start position:0%
invest 100 million dollars in school
 
00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:18.320 align:start position:0%
meal programs that are innovative
 
00:12:20.949 --> 00:12:20.959 align:start position:0%
so i think uh once
 
00:12:20.959 --> 00:12:21.750 align:start position:0%
so i think uh once
we

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:12:24.949 --> 00:12:24.959 align:start position:0%
get to the farm to school initiative we
 
00:12:24.959 --> 00:12:25.829 align:start position:0%
get to the farm to school initiative we
might

00:12:25.829 --> 00:12:25.839 align:start position:0%
might
 
00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:28.160 align:start position:0%
be looking at that as well
 
00:12:29.829 --> 00:12:29.839 align:start position:0%
and also
 
00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:33.200 align:start position:0%
excitingly today we have two people from
 
00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:36.320 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire hunger solutions
 
00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:39.120 align:start position:0%

[Music]

00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:13:09.269 --> 00:13:09.279 align:start position:0%

heard sure i thought we could sort of
 
00:13:18.949 --> 00:13:18.959 align:start position:0%
share but
 
00:13:18.959 --> 00:13:20.790 align:start position:0%
share but
um

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:20.800 align:start position:0%

00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:24.240 align:start position:0%
so uh we have a packet of materials that
 
00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
so as laura's handing that out i'm
 
00:13:30.629 --> 00:13:30.639 align:start position:0%
jessica goran i'm the deputy director of

new hampshire hunger solutions

and we're here today to
 
00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
you know talk to you about the the bills
 
00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
that were presented this year but as
 
00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
well as maybe look at some opportunities
 
00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:41.590 align:start position:0%
well as maybe look at some opportunities
for

00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:13:42.949 --> 00:13:42.959 align:start position:0%
for next year
 
00:13:42.959 --> 00:13:43.910 align:start position:0%
for next year
um

00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:46.389 --> 00:13:46.399 align:start position:0%
in all of the information you'll see new
 
00:13:48.389 --> 00:13:48.399 align:start position:0%
hampshire does really poorly in school
 
00:13:50.949 --> 00:13:50.959 align:start position:0%
breakfast participation we're 47th in
 
00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:52.240 align:start position:0%
the nation
 
00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:53.990 align:start position:0%
the nation
um

00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:55.829 --> 00:13:55.839 align:start position:0%
and what that means is that we miss
 
00:13:59.509 --> 00:13:59.519 align:start position:0%
about 7 800 kids a day
 
00:14:01.829 --> 00:14:01.839 align:start position:0%
feeding them school breakfast
 
00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
and we all know that when you have
 
00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
breakfast you can learn better
 
00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:08.240 align:start position:0%
the letters go home to
 
00:14:10.629 --> 00:14:10.639 align:start position:0%
uh families the day before any big
 
00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
standardized testing reminding famous so
 
00:14:15.509 --> 00:14:15.519 align:start position:0%
that they can do really well on those
 
00:14:15.519 --> 00:14:16.470 align:start position:0%
that they can do really well on those
tests

00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
tests
 
00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
but we know if we feed children every
 
00:14:20.629 --> 00:14:20.639 align:start position:0%
day they'll do better in school every
 
00:14:22.389 --> 00:14:22.399 align:start position:0%
day and do better on those tests every
 
00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:26.320 align:start position:0%
day um so not only do we miss feeding 7
 
00:14:28.949 --> 00:14:28.959 align:start position:0%
800 children a day but because of that
 
00:14:31.189 --> 00:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
we leave about 1.5 million
 
00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
federal dollars on the table that would
 
00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:34.880 align:start position:0%
go to
 
00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:35.750 align:start position:0%
go to
um

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:38.160 align:start position:0%
school nutrition departments they are
 
00:14:40.629 --> 00:14:40.639 align:start position:0%
separately funded they are not funded by
 
00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:42.240 align:start position:0%
the school budget they have their own
 
00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
budget and so
 
00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:45.680 align:start position:0%
when they have increased participation
 
00:14:48.069 --> 00:14:48.079 align:start position:0%
they have increased income
 
00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
and those federal dollars can help to
 
00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
support things like farm to school when
 
00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
those those dollars come in so any
 
00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:56.480 align:start position:0%
policies that we can put in place that
 
00:14:58.150 --> 00:14:58.160 align:start position:0%
will help to improve school breakfast
 
00:14:58.160 --> 00:14:59.430 align:start position:0%
will help to improve school breakfast
participation

00:14:59.430 --> 00:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
participation
 
00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:00.389 align:start position:0%
participation
will

00:15:00.389 --> 00:15:00.399 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:15:02.389 --> 00:15:02.399 align:start position:0%
help with those dollars help with
 
00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:04.480 align:start position:0%
feeding more children and also help with
 
00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:05.430 align:start position:0%
feeding more children and also help with
better

00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:05.440 align:start position:0%
better
 
00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
health outcomes and reducing food
 
00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
does anyone have any questions for uh
 
00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
representative ellison
 
00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um
 
00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:26.560 align:start position:0%
in terms of the the 47 percent
 
00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:27.670 align:start position:0%
in terms of the the 47 percent
nationally

00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:27.680 align:start position:0%
nationally
 
00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:30.240 align:start position:0%
obviously that's a that's a statewide
 
00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:31.350 align:start position:0%
obviously that's a that's a statewide
average

00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:31.360 align:start position:0%
average
 
00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:33.680 align:start position:0%
is there information available
 
00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:36.240 align:start position:0%
for the municipality by municipality
 
00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:38.800 align:start position:0%
school district by school district that
 
00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:40.880 align:start position:0%
gives us specific numbers that make up
 
00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:42.880 align:start position:0%
the 47
 
00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
so we are 47th out of 50 states right um
 
00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:47.670 align:start position:0%
so we are 47th out of 50 states right um
so

00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:47.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:15:49.829 --> 00:15:49.839 align:start position:0%
it's our it's our ranking
 
00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
but yes we do break it down by percent
 
00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
by school district
 
00:15:55.749 --> 00:15:55.759 align:start position:0%
when we get those numbers from the
 
00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:57.440 align:start position:0%
department of education
 
00:15:58.870 --> 00:15:58.880 align:start position:0%
um but just to kind of give you an
 
00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:01.120 align:start position:0%
example we work really closely with the
 
00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
nashua school district
 
00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:03.749 align:start position:0%
nashua school district
and

00:16:03.749 --> 00:16:03.759 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:16:03.759 --> 00:16:05.509 align:start position:0%
and
um

00:16:05.509 --> 00:16:05.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:07.269 --> 00:16:07.279 align:start position:0%
there are certain policies that can
 
00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:08.800 align:start position:0%
happen within a school district like
 
00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:10.480 align:start position:0%
breakfast offering breakfast after the
 
00:16:12.629 --> 00:16:12.639 align:start position:0%
bell which increases school
 
00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:14.560 align:start position:0%
breakfast participation
 
00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:16.470 align:start position:0%
breakfast participation
um

00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:16.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:19.269 --> 00:16:19.279 align:start position:0%
of the five title one elementary schools
 
00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
in nashua four have implemented
 
00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:22.480 align:start position:0%
breakfast after the bell during the
 
00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
pandemic when school meals were free and
 
00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
they are feeding about eighty percent of
 
00:16:29.269 --> 00:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
their students when they have about 72
 
00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
percent free and reduced eligibility the
 
00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
one school who is not offering breakfast
 
00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
after the bell that is a title one
 
00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
school with about 70 percent free and
 
00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
reduced eligibility is only serving 26
 
00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:42.160 align:start position:0%
of their students
 
00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:43.030 align:start position:0%
of their students
okay

00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:16:44.629 --> 00:16:44.639 align:start position:0%
so that's the kind of thing that would
 
00:16:47.189 --> 00:16:47.199 align:start position:0%
be very helpful for us and we do
 
00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:49.440 align:start position:0%
you have access to it you can get it to
 
00:16:51.749 --> 00:16:51.759 align:start position:0%
us the department of ed can get it to us
 
00:16:51.759 --> 00:16:53.030 align:start position:0%
us the department of ed can get it to us
uh

00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:54.720 align:start position:0%
not only school district by school
 
00:16:56.629 --> 00:16:56.639 align:start position:0%
district but school by school which is
 
00:16:58.790 --> 00:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
what you've just done which is what
 
00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:00.240 align:start position:0%
that's information that would be very
 
00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:02.800 align:start position:0%
helpful to us or to me yeah we're happy
 
00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:10.400 align:start position:0%
i have a question for you laura if um
 
00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:11.189 align:start position:0%
i have a question for you laura if um
so

00:17:11.189 --> 00:17:11.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:17:13.350 --> 00:17:13.360 align:start position:0%
you mentioned the nashua school district
 
00:17:16.309 --> 00:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
in particular how many school districts
 
00:17:18.870 --> 00:17:18.880 align:start position:0%
are you interfacing with
 
00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:20.240 align:start position:0%
at this point
 
00:17:22.549 --> 00:17:22.559 align:start position:0%
currently just manchester and nashua on
 
00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
and my my own follow-up is uh is that
 
00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:33.830 align:start position:0%
and my my own follow-up is uh is that
because

00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
other school districts aren't aware of
 
00:17:37.909 --> 00:17:37.919 align:start position:0%
what you're doing is it because of a
 
00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:40.400 align:start position:0%
lack of funding is
 
00:17:42.549 --> 00:17:42.559 align:start position:0%
both of those things all of the above
 
00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
and if i may jump in we're certainly
 
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:50.320 align:start position:0%
looking to expand our capacity to help
 
00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:52.160 align:start position:0%
all school districts who want to uh do
 
00:17:54.789 --> 00:17:54.799 align:start position:0%
better in their breakfast participation
 
00:17:54.799 --> 00:17:56.150 align:start position:0%
better in their breakfast participation
um

00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:57.280 align:start position:0%
i have
 
00:17:59.270 --> 00:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
if i may be so bold i have two
 
00:18:01.669 --> 00:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
suggestions for um for
 
00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:04.400 align:start position:0%
focus areas that i suggest
 
00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:05.110 align:start position:0%
focus areas that i suggest
so

00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
one is there's an opportunity to to do
 
00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
what's called medicaid direct
 
00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:11.350 align:start position:0%
what's called medicaid direct
certification

00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
certification
 
00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
you may remember that there was an uh an
 
00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:16.640 align:start position:0%
amendment to a non-germane bill
 
00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:20.320 align:start position:0%
i think it was 1620 hb 1627
 
00:18:23.029 --> 00:18:23.039 align:start position:0%
that asked the department of education
 
00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:24.400 align:start position:0%
the department of health and human
 
00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
services to participate in a medicaid
 
00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:28.960 align:start position:0%
direct certification demonstration
 
00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:32.320 align:start position:0%
project that the usda had available
 
00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:38.320 align:start position:0%
between kids who are eligible for
 
00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:40.240 align:start position:0%
medicaid and
 
00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
at the right income levels for free and
 
00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:44.240 align:start position:0%
reduced meals would be directly
 
00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:45.510 align:start position:0%
reduced meals would be directly
certified

00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:45.520 align:start position:0%
certified
 
00:18:48.789 --> 00:18:48.799 align:start position:0%
um and we um
 
00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
estimate that there would be a huge
 
00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:54.160 align:start position:0%
impact um for hungry kids in the state
 
00:18:57.190 --> 00:18:57.200 align:start position:0%
yes that actually came before us right
 
00:18:59.430 --> 00:18:59.440 align:start position:0%
at the end of the session
 
00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
i know that there was
 
00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:02.870 align:start position:0%
i know that there was
some

00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:05.440 align:start position:0%
concern about
 
00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:08.080 align:start position:0%
client privacy i believe it was the
 
00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
privacy of the data that was the red
 
00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:12.789 align:start position:0%
privacy of the data that was the red
flag

00:19:12.789 --> 00:19:12.799 align:start position:0%
flag
 
00:19:12.799 --> 00:19:13.669 align:start position:0%
flag
that

00:19:13.669 --> 00:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:19:13.679 --> 00:19:15.510 align:start position:0%
that
prevented

00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
prevented
 
00:19:17.029 --> 00:19:17.039 align:start position:0%
certain members from
 
00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
from feeling comfortable signing on so
 
00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
we have a
 
00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
in your packet the third
 
00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
handout is all about medicaid direct
 
00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:27.350 align:start position:0%
handout is all about medicaid direct
certification

00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
certification
 
00:19:29.029 --> 00:19:29.039 align:start position:0%
and certainly there were concerns
 
00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:33.280 align:start position:0%
expressed about privacy
 
00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
i think that some of the testimony
 
00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:40.000 align:start position:0%
was somewhat misinformed
 
00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
there is no sharing of of data parent
 
00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:45.520 align:start position:0%
especially parent data with the federal
 
00:19:47.909 --> 00:19:47.919 align:start position:0%
government that's just that is not what
 
00:19:47.919 --> 00:19:49.669 align:start position:0%
government that's just that is not what
happens

00:19:49.669 --> 00:19:49.679 align:start position:0%
happens
 
00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
there would be there would be data
 
00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
sharing between dhhs and doe
 
00:19:58.630 --> 00:19:58.640 align:start position:0%
but they are already sharing data to
 
00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:02.240 align:start position:0%
directly certify children on snap
 
00:20:05.110 --> 00:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
for free and reduced meals so they there
 
00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
is a track record of them doing it uh in
 
00:20:11.909 --> 00:20:11.919 align:start position:0%
a way that is respectful of of data and
 
00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
at no time is parent level data shared
 
00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:16.400 align:start position:0%
we're only talking about child level
 
00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:17.510 align:start position:0%
we're only talking about child level
data

00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
data
 
00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:19.350 align:start position:0%
data
um

00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:19.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:21.029 --> 00:20:21.039 align:start position:0%
can i'm sorry
 
00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:23.120 align:start position:0%
can i add to that real quick i just i
 
00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
have been working really closely with
 
00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
manchester nashua as i said and i spent
 
00:20:27.909 --> 00:20:27.919 align:start position:0%
some time with their free and reduced
 
00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:30.320 align:start position:0%
eligibility administrators their free
 
00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
and reduced eligibility administrators
 
00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
are the only ones in the school district
 
00:20:37.029 --> 00:20:37.039 align:start position:0%
that have any access to the student data
 
00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:40.400 align:start position:0%
when it comes in and it's only to um
 
00:20:42.549 --> 00:20:42.559 align:start position:0%
identify them as free or reduced
 
00:20:42.559 --> 00:20:43.669 align:start position:0%
identify them as free or reduced
eligible

00:20:43.669 --> 00:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
eligible
 
00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:46.480 align:start position:0%
and then it is all coded electronically
 
00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
so when that student comes with their id
 
00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
um they swipe their id and their meal is
 
00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
taken care of right there's no
 
00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:55.110 align:start position:0%
taken care of right there's no
additional

00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
additional
 
00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
identification that that child would be
 
00:20:59.270 --> 00:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
free or reduced and so and every student
 
00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:00.880 align:start position:0%
pays for their meal that way so it
 
00:21:02.789 --> 00:21:02.799 align:start position:0%
doesn't identify those students in any
 
00:21:04.149 --> 00:21:04.159 align:start position:0%
way at all
 
00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:06.400 align:start position:0%
and that one person is the only person
 
00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:08.720 align:start position:0%
that has access to the data they're so
 
00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
careful with it that if they know that
 
00:21:13.029 --> 00:21:13.039 align:start position:0%
social services in their school district
 
00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:15.200 align:start position:0%
is working with a family that is free
 
00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:16.400 align:start position:0%
and reduced eligible
 
00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:18.400 align:start position:0%
they cannot reach out to that social
 
00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:21.440 align:start position:0%
services teacher and ask for them to
 
00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:23.360 align:start position:0%
help fill out that form
 
00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
because um
 
00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:32.390 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:34.549 --> 00:21:34.559 align:start position:0%
so i'm happy to answer more questions
 
00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
about medicaid direct certification if
 
00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:38.480 align:start position:0%
that's um the other thing that i sort of
 
00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to throw out there is that summer
 
00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
meals is a real issue um
 
00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
and you know is uh similarly
 
00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
administered although some
 
00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
some summer meal sites are not schools
 
00:21:51.909 --> 00:21:51.919 align:start position:0%
they are community based
 
00:21:51.919 --> 00:21:53.510 align:start position:0%
they are community based
um

00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:55.909 --> 00:21:55.919 align:start position:0%
it seems to me to be an extension of
 
00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
school meals
 
00:21:59.510 --> 00:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
it's sort of what do we do when
 
00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:02.480 align:start position:0%
children are not in school
 
00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
and are hungry
 
00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:04.870 align:start position:0%
and are hungry
so

00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:06.390 align:start position:0%
so
i

00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:06.400 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
respectfully suggest representative
 
00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
ellison and
 
00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:12.400 align:start position:0%
following up on that are the
 
00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rates for for summer meals
 
00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
however they're being delivered the same
 
00:22:18.549 --> 00:22:18.559 align:start position:0%
as they are during the school year are
 
00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
they different
 
00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:21.440 align:start position:0%
well it's a bit of a complicated
 
00:22:23.909 --> 00:22:23.919 align:start position:0%
question because it depends on where you
 
00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
are and you're on the community's level
 
00:22:27.029 --> 00:22:27.039 align:start position:0%
of poverty
 
00:22:28.549 --> 00:22:28.559 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:22:28.559 --> 00:22:29.590 align:start position:0%
um so
um

00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:34.720 align:start position:0%
can you answer that more clearly and
 
00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
there's two summer feeding programs one
 
00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
for um areas that
 
00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:43.200 align:start position:0%
are not eligible to feed all children 0
 
00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
to 18 and that's this
 
00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:48.320 align:start position:0%
summer feeding program and then there's
 
00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:50.240 align:start position:0%
a seamless summer option and seymour
 
00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
seamless summer option is what the
 
00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:54.400 align:start position:0%
school districts are using right now to
 
00:22:56.789 --> 00:22:56.799 align:start position:0%
feed all kids year round and that's at a
 
00:22:58.870 --> 00:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
higher reimbursement because it's based
 
00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
on higher poverty rates
 
00:23:02.149 --> 00:23:02.159 align:start position:0%
and that's where the medicaid direct
 
00:23:04.149 --> 00:23:04.159 align:start position:0%
certification that laura is talking
 
00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:06.480 align:start position:0%
about would also be beneficial because
 
00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
when more students are identified
 
00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:12.320 align:start position:0%
as being eligible it increases that area
 
00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:14.240 align:start position:0%
eligibility and it would increase the
 
00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
communities in new hampshire that can
 
00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:19.280 align:start position:0%
offer free summer meals for all
 
00:23:24.549 --> 00:23:24.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:26.480 align:start position:0%
just to add one more thing
 
00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:28.400 align:start position:0%
sorry to keep switching back and forth
 
00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:29.510 align:start position:0%
sorry to keep switching back and forth
but

00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:23:31.909 --> 00:23:31.919 align:start position:0%
there is a genuine crisis that's about
 
00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
to happen um countrywide but certainly
 
00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire as the
 
00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
uh the waivers that have allowed schools
 
00:23:41.909 --> 00:23:41.919 align:start position:0%
and summer meal programs to feed all
 
00:23:43.909 --> 00:23:43.919 align:start position:0%
children will end at the end of june
 
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
unless congress acts
 
00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:46.950 align:start position:0%
unless congress acts
so

00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
but if those waivers end
 
00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
you know we have already been contacted
 
00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:53.360 align:start position:0%
by a number of summer meals programs
 
00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:55.200 align:start position:0%
that are not going to be able to do the
 
00:23:56.950 --> 00:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
the level of service that they did last
 
00:23:58.549 --> 00:23:58.559 align:start position:0%
year or not going to be able to offer
 
00:24:00.549 --> 00:24:00.559 align:start position:0%
summer meals at all
 
00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:02.320 align:start position:0%
and school districts
 
00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:03.190 align:start position:0%
and school districts
will

00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:03.200 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
have a very very difficult time you know
 
00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:08.320 align:start position:0%
figuring out how to feed as many kids as
 
00:24:10.149 --> 00:24:10.159 align:start position:0%
as they did before most of them will
 
00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
only be able to serve children who are
 
00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
eligible for free and reduced meals
 
00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
at those respective costs um and
 
00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:21.200 align:start position:0%
and that will
 
00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:23.360 align:start position:0%
no doubt create hunger
 
00:24:28.789 --> 00:24:28.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:31.669 --> 00:24:31.679 align:start position:0%
uh yeah i've uh so
 
00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:34.720 align:start position:0%
does your organization have uh
 
00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
any access to
 
00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:40.880 align:start position:0%
what implementing a breakfast program
 
00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
for instance we have a couple of bills
 
00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
that were that are specifically looking
 
00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:46.720 align:start position:0%
at breakfast programs
 
00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
we heard
 
00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
some facts and figures during the
 
00:24:54.390 --> 00:24:54.400 align:start position:0%
lap during this session
 
00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:55.190 align:start position:0%
lap during this session
that

00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:24:57.750 --> 00:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
it was estimated that maybe 30 schools
 
00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:01.200 align:start position:0%
were not providing breakfast
 
00:25:03.669 --> 00:25:03.679 align:start position:0%
and that maybe one of the reasons they
 
00:25:05.430 --> 00:25:05.440 align:start position:0%
weren't providing breakfast was because
 
00:25:07.669 --> 00:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
they could not
 
00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
absorb the startup costs for a breakfast
 
00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:12.070 align:start position:0%
absorb the startup costs for a breakfast
program

00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
does new hampshire
 
00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
hunger solutions have any data
 
00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:20.960 align:start position:0%
at all on what those startup costs
 
00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:24.240 align:start position:0%
might be per student or
 
00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:28.720 align:start position:0%
do you have anecdotal information about
 
00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
places where
 
00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:32.240 align:start position:0%
it was thought to be impossible and yet
 
00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:34.480 align:start position:0%
here it is and it's working
 
00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:37.430 align:start position:0%
here it is and it's working
effectively

00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
we don't have that data on hand at this
 
00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
moment in time but as a part of this you
 
00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
know committee we could get we could
 
00:25:46.549 --> 00:25:46.559 align:start position:0%
gather that data i would say that it's
 
00:25:48.789 --> 00:25:48.799 align:start position:0%
um probably the majority of it is a
 
00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
staffing issue and funds for staffing
 
00:25:52.549 --> 00:25:52.559 align:start position:0%
because those staff members would have
 
00:25:55.029 --> 00:25:55.039 align:start position:0%
to come in at an earlier hour so it's
 
00:25:56.470 --> 00:25:56.480 align:start position:0%
the initial
 
00:25:59.029 --> 00:25:59.039 align:start position:0%
it would be the initial labor hours that
 
00:26:00.789 --> 00:26:00.799 align:start position:0%
are needed in order to start up a
 
00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
breakfast program
 
00:26:03.909 --> 00:26:03.919 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
in food purchasing but
 
00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
i know that
 
00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:08.480 align:start position:0%
that gets reimbursed and the commodity
 
00:26:09.669 --> 00:26:09.679 align:start position:0%
foods that come into the school
 
00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
districts can cover that initially so
 
00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
um in my opinion it would be labor hours
 
00:26:16.789 --> 00:26:16.799 align:start position:0%
initially but laura has something else
 
00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
oh i was just going to say that i think
 
00:26:20.149 --> 00:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
that the best people to ask that
 
00:26:21.909 --> 00:26:21.919 align:start position:0%
question to is the do
 
00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
or at the doe i mean i think that um
 
00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
that uh they've probably
 
00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:29.360 align:start position:0%
well there's not
 
00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
so much turnover there but i think that
 
00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:32.870 align:start position:0%
so much turnover there but i think that
um

00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:33.750 align:start position:0%
um
uh

00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:26:36.149 --> 00:26:36.159 align:start position:0%
there are people probably who have um
 
00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:38.480 align:start position:0%
shepherded people through so
 
00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:39.269 align:start position:0%
shepherded people through so
um

00:26:39.269 --> 00:26:39.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
our own board chair uh
 
00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:44.640 align:start position:0%
uh ran the nutrition uh
 
00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
programs at the doe and we could
 
00:26:49.990 --> 00:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
certainly uh talk to her about how um
 
00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:51.440 align:start position:0%
sherry white
 
00:26:53.909 --> 00:26:53.919 align:start position:0%
oh no before sherry i'll be fortunate
 
00:26:55.830 --> 00:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
okay all right i'm like
 
00:26:58.549 --> 00:26:58.559 align:start position:0%
sherry white now retired go and do this
 
00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:00.320 align:start position:0%
oh sherry retired
 
00:27:03.029 --> 00:27:03.039 align:start position:0%
all right no i'm sure sherry would know
 
00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:04.960 align:start position:0%
yes yes
 
00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you as i mentioned um we have
 
00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:09.200 align:start position:0%
them scheduled to come in and meet with
 
00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
us next week
 
00:27:14.549 --> 00:27:14.559 align:start position:0%
um but you folks were so on top of
 
00:27:17.269 --> 00:27:17.279 align:start position:0%
things and so enthusiastic about coming
 
00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
in today it
 
00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
was bring it on down absolutely if you
 
00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
have information for us
 
00:27:25.029 --> 00:27:25.039 align:start position:0%
share it
 
00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:27.200 align:start position:0%
i i think what we'll
 
00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
what i see us doing during this meeting
 
00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
and then piggybacking on the doe is
 
00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
maybe coming up with a list of questions
 
00:27:37.669 --> 00:27:37.679 align:start position:0%
that we would like answered and
 
00:27:37.679 --> 00:27:39.110 align:start position:0%
that we would like answered and
certainly

00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:40.720 align:start position:0%
on this committee
 
00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:42.640 align:start position:0%
we look at
 
00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:44.950 align:start position:0%
we look at
cost

00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
cost
 
00:27:47.669 --> 00:27:47.679 align:start position:0%
and i know that
 
00:27:49.669 --> 00:27:49.679 align:start position:0%
whether it was the structure of the
 
00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:52.720 align:start position:0%
bills themselves or
 
00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:54.720 align:start position:0%
i i don't have the answer for why it
 
00:27:58.470 --> 00:27:58.480 align:start position:0%
seemed so difficult to estimate
 
00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
what exactly things would cost
 
00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:03.200 align:start position:0%
but um
 
00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:06.320 align:start position:0%
you know representative horgan's bill i
 
00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
i think was somewhere around six hundred
 
00:28:11.269 --> 00:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
and fifty thousand dollars and
 
00:28:13.870 --> 00:28:13.880 align:start position:0%
representative de shea's bill it was
 
00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:16.960 align:start position:0%
determined that they couldn't estimate a
 
00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:23.669 --> 00:28:23.679 align:start position:0%
anything you can do to sort of give us
 
00:28:23.679 --> 00:28:24.630 align:start position:0%
anything you can do to sort of give us
uh

00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:24.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
any thriving indicators that you have
 
00:28:29.029 --> 00:28:29.039 align:start position:0%
would be greatly helpful for us as a
 
00:28:29.039 --> 00:28:31.830 align:start position:0%
would be greatly helpful for us as a
committee

00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:35.440 align:start position:0%
representative allison uh just another
 
00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:38.240 align:start position:0%
question to to tie down numbers here
 
00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
that bill that we dealt with with the 30
 
00:28:42.789 --> 00:28:42.799 align:start position:0%
school districts that didn't have
 
00:28:44.389 --> 00:28:44.399 align:start position:0%
breakfast and
 
00:28:46.549 --> 00:28:46.559 align:start position:0%
that was a struggle uh
 
00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:48.640 align:start position:0%
just on that alone
 
00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:49.909 align:start position:0%
just on that alone
but

00:28:49.909 --> 00:28:49.919 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
you're talking here about
 
00:28:55.909 --> 00:28:55.919 align:start position:0%
7 869 students without school breakfast
 
00:28:57.830 --> 00:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that goes beyond 30
 
00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
school districts then doesn't it yes
 
00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:04.880 align:start position:0%
yeah those are the um students that we
 
00:29:07.669 --> 00:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
so i'll start with the formula there's
 
00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
food research and action center provides
 
00:29:12.389 --> 00:29:12.399 align:start position:0%
a formula to measure school breakfast
 
00:29:15.269 --> 00:29:15.279 align:start position:0%
participation um so they look at for
 
00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
every 100 students that are free and
 
00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
reduced eligible participating in lunch
 
00:29:21.669 --> 00:29:21.679 align:start position:0%
that there would be 70 free and reduced
 
00:29:23.190 --> 00:29:23.200 align:start position:0%
eligible students participating in
 
00:29:25.669 --> 00:29:25.679 align:start position:0%
breakfast in each school okay so that's
 
00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:28.720 align:start position:0%
where that that measurement of and the 7
 
00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:29.669 align:start position:0%
where that that measurement of and the 7
800

00:29:29.669 --> 00:29:29.679 align:start position:0%
800
 
00:29:33.029 --> 00:29:33.039 align:start position:0%
100 um that number comes from frack
 
00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:35.440 align:start position:0%
so um that's only for school districts
 
00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
that are participating in the school
 
00:29:38.549 --> 00:29:38.559 align:start position:0%
breakfast program that would it would be
 
00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:40.640 align:start position:0%
additional to include the 30 school
 
00:29:42.710 --> 00:29:42.720 align:start position:0%
districts that do not have a school
 
00:29:44.549 --> 00:29:44.559 align:start position:0%
breakfast program
 
00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:47.120 align:start position:0%
so we're we're talking about in the 78
 
00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
69 we're talking about school districts
 
00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
that offer a breakfast program but not
 
00:29:53.029 --> 00:29:53.039 align:start position:0%
everyone who is eligible for the
 
00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
breakfast program is participating and
 
00:29:56.389 --> 00:29:56.399 align:start position:0%
that's the
 
00:29:58.710 --> 00:29:58.720 align:start position:0%
that's the difference is am i correct
 
00:29:58.720 --> 00:29:59.830 align:start position:0%
that's the difference is am i correct
and

00:29:59.830 --> 00:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:15.269 --> 00:30:15.279 align:start position:0%
any questions representative ford or
 
00:30:17.269 --> 00:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
representative hall any additional
 
00:30:17.279 --> 00:30:21.269 align:start position:0%
representative hall any additional
questions

00:30:21.269 --> 00:30:21.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:23.830 --> 00:30:23.840 align:start position:0%
anything that you folks would
 
00:30:29.669 --> 00:30:29.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:31.200 align:start position:0%
well certainly work to answer the
 
00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
questions you've raised um although i
 
00:30:35.269 --> 00:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
think we'll need help from the doa for
 
00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:37.120 align:start position:0%
much of it right um
 
00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
and um and we look forward to addressing
 
00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:41.360 align:start position:0%
this we um
 
00:30:43.430 --> 00:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
you know uh have been
 
00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
trying to increase our capacity
 
00:30:48.549 --> 00:30:48.559 align:start position:0%
to address this issue um and and to
 
00:30:50.389 --> 00:30:50.399 align:start position:0%
assist schools
 
00:30:51.909 --> 00:30:51.919 align:start position:0%
in expanding their breakfast
 
00:30:54.230 --> 00:30:54.240 align:start position:0%
participation by changing the way they
 
00:30:56.310 --> 00:30:56.320 align:start position:0%
offer breakfast
 
00:30:58.470 --> 00:30:58.480 align:start position:0%
this is a challenging time for schools
 
00:31:00.389 --> 00:31:00.399 align:start position:0%
and we're really well aware of that
 
00:31:02.789 --> 00:31:02.799 align:start position:0%
right both because of supply chain
 
00:31:02.799 --> 00:31:04.310 align:start position:0%
right both because of supply chain
issues

00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:31:07.029 --> 00:31:07.039 align:start position:0%
with food and because of staffing issues
 
00:31:07.039 --> 00:31:07.750 align:start position:0%
with food and because of staffing issues
so

00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:31:11.509 --> 00:31:11.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:14.720 align:start position:0%
clear that we are
 
00:31:17.590 --> 00:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
very cautious about asking schools to do
 
00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:20.240 align:start position:0%
more without adequate support right you
 
00:31:22.549 --> 00:31:22.559 align:start position:0%
have to have an infrastructure and
 
00:31:24.470 --> 00:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
for the building to stand representative
 
00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:29.360 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:31:31.669 --> 00:31:31.679 align:start position:0%
i have a
 
00:31:34.149 --> 00:31:34.159 align:start position:0%
sort of an untechnical question if you
 
00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:35.840 align:start position:0%
will it's more of an attitudinal
 
00:31:38.389 --> 00:31:38.399 align:start position:0%
question but you probably experienced it
 
00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to ask you
 
00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
without reference to any particular
 
00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:43.190 align:start position:0%
without reference to any particular
school

00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:43.200 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:31:45.669 --> 00:31:45.679 align:start position:0%
but one of the comments we heard when we
 
00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:48.480 align:start position:0%
were talking about this
 
00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
though several months ago
 
00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:53.120 align:start position:0%
was that if the school system wanted to
 
00:31:55.269 --> 00:31:55.279 align:start position:0%
have breakfast and they should decide to
 
00:31:58.549 --> 00:31:58.559 align:start position:0%
have breakfast and there was kind of a
 
00:32:01.669 --> 00:32:01.679 align:start position:0%
they choose not to kind of
 
00:32:04.149 --> 00:32:04.159 align:start position:0%
propose our statement and
 
00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
not i mean the last school lunch i ate
 
00:32:09.590 --> 00:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
was in 1957 so i don't claim any
 
00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
expertise in this at all
 
00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:12.950 align:start position:0%
expertise in this at all
um

00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:16.630 --> 00:32:16.640 align:start position:0%
but it was just sort of
 
00:32:19.509 --> 00:32:19.519 align:start position:0%
is it just a question of the um
 
00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
shall we say wealth of the town the
 
00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:24.320 align:start position:0%
budget kinds of sensitivity that they
 
00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:26.640 align:start position:0%
might choose not to have breakfast for
 
00:32:29.269 --> 00:32:29.279 align:start position:0%
children an occasion quite a flurry in
 
00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:32.960 align:start position:0%
our committee about people who would say
 
00:32:34.789 --> 00:32:34.799 align:start position:0%
how can you tell that these kids come to
 
00:32:36.470 --> 00:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
school hungry
 
00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
well then the people who had been
 
00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
teachers and principals spoke up and
 
00:32:42.389 --> 00:32:42.399 align:start position:0%
said they don't perform very well
 
00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
and so i was just sort of looking for
 
00:32:47.909 --> 00:32:47.919 align:start position:0%
your read when you see it
 
00:32:51.269 --> 00:32:51.279 align:start position:0%
what do you sense is is the kind of
 
00:32:53.909 --> 00:32:53.919 align:start position:0%
i guess knee-jerk reaction when you say
 
00:32:56.230 --> 00:32:56.240 align:start position:0%
we need to have more food in the schools
 
00:32:58.470 --> 00:32:58.480 align:start position:0%
or more breakfast or something like that
 
00:33:00.310 --> 00:33:00.320 align:start position:0%
if you feel free to comment on that i
 
00:33:02.389 --> 00:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
would appreciate it thank you
 
00:33:03.750 --> 00:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
you know and you don't have to bag
 
00:33:05.509 --> 00:33:05.519 align:start position:0%
anybody in particular it can be a broad
 
00:33:11.590 --> 00:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:13.190 --> 00:33:13.200 align:start position:0%
i think laura and i probably both have
 
00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:14.960 align:start position:0%
different stories to share and things
 
00:33:17.909 --> 00:33:17.919 align:start position:0%
that we can add so i'll start with just
 
00:33:17.919 --> 00:33:18.950 align:start position:0%
that we can add so i'll start with just
um

00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:20.720 align:start position:0%
i know in
 
00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:22.070 align:start position:0%
i know in
um

00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:23.269 --> 00:33:23.279 align:start position:0%
schools that we've worked with and
 
00:33:24.549 --> 00:33:24.559 align:start position:0%
talked to that
 
00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
school nurses have 25 visit 25 hunger
 
00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
related visits a day per school in the
 
00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:31.590 align:start position:0%
related visits a day per school in the
district

00:33:31.590 --> 00:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
district
 
00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:33.440 align:start position:0%
um that's kids going to the nurse's
 
00:33:34.950 --> 00:33:34.960 align:start position:0%
office because they have a headache a
 
00:33:38.070 --> 00:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
stomach ache they're feeling tired um a
 
00:33:40.389 --> 00:33:40.399 align:start position:0%
variety of reasons and then the nurse
 
00:33:42.630 --> 00:33:42.640 align:start position:0%
codes that because they're that that
 
00:33:44.789 --> 00:33:44.799 align:start position:0%
student was um
 
00:33:44.799 --> 00:33:45.909 align:start position:0%
student was um
their

00:33:45.909 --> 00:33:45.919 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:33:48.149 --> 00:33:48.159 align:start position:0%
symptoms were alleviated by being by
 
00:33:50.389 --> 00:33:50.399 align:start position:0%
having a snack or given a breakfast um
 
00:33:52.389 --> 00:33:52.399 align:start position:0%
because they weren't able to have
 
00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
breakfast when they left the house or
 
00:33:55.350 --> 00:33:55.360 align:start position:0%
maybe they left the house at six a.m and
 
00:33:57.590 --> 00:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
by nine they're really hungry again
 
00:33:59.269 --> 00:33:59.279 align:start position:0%
right um
 
00:34:01.269 --> 00:34:01.279 align:start position:0%
so when a school district does not offer
 
00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
breakfast at all there's not even that
 
00:34:06.149 --> 00:34:06.159 align:start position:0%
other opportunity so i think that the
 
00:34:07.669 --> 00:34:07.679 align:start position:0%
you know when we start asking these
 
00:34:09.349 --> 00:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
questions we have to look deeper right
 
00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
and asking the school nurse like how
 
00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
many visits are they seeing how much
 
00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:14.800 align:start position:0%
money is the school nurse spending out
 
00:34:17.190 --> 00:34:17.200 align:start position:0%
of their own pocket to provide snacks
 
00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:18.800 align:start position:0%
how much money is the are the teachers
 
00:34:20.470 --> 00:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
spending out of their own money
 
00:34:22.869 --> 00:34:22.879 align:start position:0%
to provide snacks or um some schools
 
00:34:24.629 --> 00:34:24.639 align:start position:0%
even have pantry programs how much money
 
00:34:26.550 --> 00:34:26.560 align:start position:0%
are they spending out of their pantry
 
00:34:29.109 --> 00:34:29.119 align:start position:0%
project in order to offer snacks in the
 
00:34:30.950 --> 00:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
morning when the school breakfast is no
 
00:34:33.109 --> 00:34:33.119 align:start position:0%
longer available um whether it's because
 
00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:35.200 align:start position:0%
there's a breakfast isn't offered after
 
00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:36.720 align:start position:0%
the bell or
 
00:34:38.389 --> 00:34:38.399 align:start position:0%
breakfast is not offered by that school
 
00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
at all um and i think that in general
 
00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:42.720 align:start position:0%
people have been really surprised when
 
00:34:46.389 --> 00:34:46.399 align:start position:0%
they hear the percent of students that
 
00:34:47.750 --> 00:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
are having hunger hunger-related visits
 
00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
but that might not even have had dinner
 
00:34:51.669 --> 00:34:51.679 align:start position:0%
the night before so the only meal
 
00:34:53.829 --> 00:34:53.839 align:start position:0%
they're getting a day is school lunch if
 
00:34:56.310 --> 00:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
they participate in that
 
00:34:58.069 --> 00:34:58.079 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:35:00.069 --> 00:35:00.079 align:start position:0%
and one thing that i would add is that i
 
00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:02.240 align:start position:0%
think that
 
00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
schools often are very busy being
 
00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
schools and educating students and
 
00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
aren't as focused on their school meal
 
00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:13.760 align:start position:0%
programs i think that despite the fact
 
00:35:15.589 --> 00:35:15.599 align:start position:0%
that there are quite a number of studies
 
00:35:17.910 --> 00:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
now that show the benefits of breakfast
 
00:35:20.069 --> 00:35:20.079 align:start position:0%
to students not just in the short term
 
00:35:21.670 --> 00:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
but really
 
00:35:24.069 --> 00:35:24.079 align:start position:0%
in the long term and i've included a
 
00:35:27.349 --> 00:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
couple of uh of articles um
 
00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:28.480 align:start position:0%
with the
 
00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:32.480 align:start position:0%
study sources uh cited
 
00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:34.240 align:start position:0%
so despite the fact that there is all
 
00:35:35.910 --> 00:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
this great research that shows how
 
00:35:37.750 --> 00:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
important breakfast is i think it's not
 
00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:40.640 align:start position:0%
well understood i think people i think
 
00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:42.720 align:start position:0%
that often schools think well we offer
 
00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:44.230 align:start position:0%
that often schools think well we offer
breakfast

00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:44.240 align:start position:0%
breakfast
 
00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:46.720 align:start position:0%
you know not realizing that the
 
00:35:49.349 --> 00:35:49.359 align:start position:0%
breakfast participation because kids
 
00:35:51.349 --> 00:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
have to come in early and sort of be
 
00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:57.990 --> 00:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
so often kids don't participate as they
 
00:35:59.510 --> 00:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
get older because they don't want to be
 
00:36:03.349 --> 00:36:03.359 align:start position:0%
stigmatized so i i think there's a lot
 
00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
of education to do i guess this
 
00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
is the takeaway i think that
 
00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:09.030 align:start position:0%
is the takeaway i think that
um

00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:09.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
that schools
 
00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
need to better understand and they need
 
00:36:15.990 --> 00:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
the support to to make changes
 
00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
i i have a question for you um do you
 
00:36:22.150 --> 00:36:22.160 align:start position:0%
have a sense of uh
 
00:36:25.270 --> 00:36:25.280 align:start position:0%
i mean manchester and nashua are similar
 
00:36:27.670 --> 00:36:27.680 align:start position:0%
in the sense that they're both cities
 
00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:29.430 align:start position:0%
in the sense that they're both cities
but

00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:29.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:32.720 align:start position:0%
different certainly in
 
00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:35.440 align:start position:0%
makeup and
 
00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:37.109 align:start position:0%
makeup and
population

00:36:37.109 --> 00:36:37.119 align:start position:0%
population
 
00:36:39.589 --> 00:36:39.599 align:start position:0%
do you have a sense of
 
00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
what the percentage of
 
00:36:44.470 --> 00:36:44.480 align:start position:0%
you know total population of students
 
00:36:47.589 --> 00:36:47.599 align:start position:0%
what the percentage of kids
 
00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
who would benefit from
 
00:36:53.990 --> 00:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
a program like this is and how the
 
00:36:59.349 --> 00:36:59.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:02.950 --> 00:37:02.960 align:start position:0%
i mean is it 50 of the students is it 75
 
00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
percent of the students or does it vary
 
00:37:06.829 --> 00:37:06.839 align:start position:0%
from neighborhood to
 
00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
neighborhood so it'll vary from school
 
00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:13.280 align:start position:0%
to school um and then by school district
 
00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:14.069 align:start position:0%
to school um and then by school district
and

00:37:14.069 --> 00:37:14.079 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:37:15.990 --> 00:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
um and then by community in new
 
00:37:18.310 --> 00:37:18.320 align:start position:0%
hampshire right so it is it's a little
 
00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
bit of it's
 
00:37:21.990 --> 00:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
um it can be complicated math but the
 
00:37:24.069 --> 00:37:24.079 align:start position:0%
doe does a great job of breaking down
 
00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
all of the percents of free and reduced
 
00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
applications that are of eligibility by
 
00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:30.880 align:start position:0%
community so what we do at new hampshire
 
00:37:32.310 --> 00:37:32.320 align:start position:0%
hunger solutions is when we're working
 
00:37:34.390 --> 00:37:34.400 align:start position:0%
with the community we look at on percent
 
00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:35.430 align:start position:0%
with the community we look at on percent
poverty

00:37:35.430 --> 00:37:35.440 align:start position:0%
poverty
 
00:37:37.750 --> 00:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
and then we look at on percent poverty
 
00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:40.640 align:start position:0%
by census tract and and look at it with
 
00:37:42.310 --> 00:37:42.320 align:start position:0%
um free and reduced eligibility for
 
00:37:45.510 --> 00:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
example manchester has about 46 percent
 
00:37:48.310 --> 00:37:48.320 align:start position:0%
overall free and reduced eligibility
 
00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:50.720 align:start position:0%
but there are schools in their district
 
00:37:52.390 --> 00:37:52.400 align:start position:0%
that have eighty percent so when we're
 
00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:54.720 align:start position:0%
looking at that census tract or that
 
00:37:56.630 --> 00:37:56.640 align:start position:0%
school district um we would look at the
 
00:37:57.990 --> 00:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
census tracts
 
00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
that attend that school
 
00:38:01.510 --> 00:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
to measure that so
 
00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:02.630 align:start position:0%
to measure that so
um

00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:02.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
for the 30 schools that don't have a
 
00:38:07.109 --> 00:38:07.119 align:start position:0%
breakfast program we would have to have
 
00:38:08.790 --> 00:38:08.800 align:start position:0%
a list of those schools and then we
 
00:38:09.750 --> 00:38:09.760 align:start position:0%
could then
 
00:38:11.430 --> 00:38:11.440 align:start position:0%
go and look at their free and reduced
 
00:38:13.030 --> 00:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
eligibility and see the percent of
 
00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:14.640 align:start position:0%
students that would be impacted by
 
00:38:16.870 --> 00:38:16.880 align:start position:0%
having a breakfast program
 
00:38:19.109 --> 00:38:19.119 align:start position:0%
and then base it on
 
00:38:21.190 --> 00:38:21.200 align:start position:0%
lunch participation so
 
00:38:22.310 --> 00:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
it's that
 
00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:24.720 align:start position:0%
percent of free and reduced eligible
 
00:38:26.069 --> 00:38:26.079 align:start position:0%
students participating in lunch we're
 
00:38:28.390 --> 00:38:28.400 align:start position:0%
looking for 70 of them to participate in
 
00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:31.670 align:start position:0%
looking for 70 of them to participate in
breakfast

00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:33.910 --> 00:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for that and my the second
 
00:38:37.589 --> 00:38:37.599 align:start position:0%
part of my question was how are they
 
00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:40.160 align:start position:0%
managing this in terms of
 
00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:42.880 align:start position:0%
resources i mean you mentioned
 
00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:44.630 align:start position:0%
resources i mean you mentioned
staffing

00:38:44.630 --> 00:38:44.640 align:start position:0%
staffing
 
00:38:45.829 --> 00:38:45.839 align:start position:0%
obviously if you're going to serve
 
00:38:47.109 --> 00:38:47.119 align:start position:0%
breakfast you have to have at least a
 
00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
few people in in the morning to sort of
 
00:38:50.870 --> 00:38:50.880 align:start position:0%
get things up and rolling so the
 
00:38:53.829 --> 00:38:53.839 align:start position:0%
districts would be um
 
00:38:55.589 --> 00:38:55.599 align:start position:0%
on the hook for that
 
00:38:57.589 --> 00:38:57.599 align:start position:0%
uh what about what
 
00:38:59.750 --> 00:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
or would they the districts the the
 
00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:03.200 align:start position:0%
school district budget is separate from
 
00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
the school food service budget
 
00:39:07.589 --> 00:39:07.599 align:start position:0%
which in a lot of communities in new
 
00:39:10.150 --> 00:39:10.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire um they actually source that
 
00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
out to other programs like cafe services
 
00:39:15.109 --> 00:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
um and i'm losing the other ones but
 
00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
there's a couple other in the state that
 
00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:18.800 align:start position:0%
off that that provide the programs and
 
00:39:21.109 --> 00:39:21.119 align:start position:0%
it's because they're funded separately
 
00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
so um their funds come from the
 
00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:25.200 align:start position:0%
reimbursement from school meals
 
00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:26.710 align:start position:0%
reimbursement from school meals
so

00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:26.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:39:28.310 --> 00:39:28.320 align:start position:0%
i apologize for not having these numbers
 
00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:30.640 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head but like this was
 
00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
supposed to be an organizational meeting
 
00:39:35.270 --> 00:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
we're gonna we'll be meeting again okay
 
00:39:38.069 --> 00:39:38.079 align:start position:0%
good so uh school breakfast is about two
 
00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:40.160 align:start position:0%
dollars and sixty cents reimbursement
 
00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
for a um
 
00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
free a student who is eligible for for
 
00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
uh for free breakfast so of that 2.61
 
00:39:55.109 --> 00:39:55.119 align:start position:0%
or 60 cents per student um that meal
 
00:39:56.950 --> 00:39:56.960 align:start position:0%
reimbursement pays for the cost of the
 
00:39:59.270 --> 00:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
meal and pays for the labor hours
 
00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
and anything any other overhead that's
 
00:40:04.309 --> 00:40:04.319 align:start position:0%
associated with serving that one meal
 
00:40:06.309 --> 00:40:06.319 align:start position:0%
per student so
 
00:40:09.190 --> 00:40:09.200 align:start position:0%
um so again it's numbers the more
 
00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
students that participate and
 
00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
by protect providing breakfast after the
 
00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
bowel you get more students to
 
00:40:17.589 --> 00:40:17.599 align:start position:0%
participate um then they'll have more
 
00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:18.720 align:start position:0%
money to
 
00:40:21.109 --> 00:40:21.119 align:start position:0%
fund a breakfast program there may be
 
00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
some there definitely are startup costs
 
00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
um involved and again like laura said
 
00:40:27.270 --> 00:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
the doe would know more about that but
 
00:40:29.430 --> 00:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
as far as once it's up and running um
 
00:40:31.270 --> 00:40:31.280 align:start position:0%
those are the types of that's how those
 
00:40:35.270 --> 00:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:37.109 --> 00:40:37.119 align:start position:0%
representative paul
 
00:40:38.470 --> 00:40:38.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:40:42.309 --> 00:40:42.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:43.280 align:start position:0%
are there
 
00:40:45.270 --> 00:40:45.280 align:start position:0%
any kids who are left out because
 
00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
parents aren't
 
00:40:49.910 --> 00:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
willing to do the paperwork to
 
00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
and how is that
 
00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:53.440 align:start position:0%
handled so
 
00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
you know how if they're not willing to
 
00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
say hey i need help
 
00:40:58.390 --> 00:40:58.400 align:start position:0%
i'm too proud
 
00:40:59.750 --> 00:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
you know what about like cause i have a
 
00:41:01.510 --> 00:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
feeling that might be
 
00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:02.550 align:start position:0%
feeling that might be
super

00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
super
 
00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:04.560 align:start position:0%
population out there yeah and that is
 
00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:06.720 align:start position:0%
when the school district is impacted
 
00:41:09.109 --> 00:41:09.119 align:start position:0%
when a parent doesn't fill out the form
 
00:41:10.470 --> 00:41:10.480 align:start position:0%
that that
 
00:41:12.309 --> 00:41:12.319 align:start position:0%
is presented to
 
00:41:13.910 --> 00:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
the school district
 
00:41:16.390 --> 00:41:16.400 align:start position:0%
to reimburse that debt so
 
00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
if a child is eligible but not
 
00:41:19.829 --> 00:41:19.839 align:start position:0%
identified as eligible because the form
 
00:41:21.030 --> 00:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
is not completed and they're not
 
00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:23.200 align:start position:0%
directly certified through snap tanf or
 
00:41:24.550 --> 00:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
foster care
 
00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:26.800 align:start position:0%
then um
 
00:41:28.790 --> 00:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
then they just keep tap
 
00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
receiving a bill
 
00:41:32.069 --> 00:41:32.079 align:start position:0%
every time they participate in school
 
00:41:33.750 --> 00:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
lunch and depending on the school
 
00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
district and it's not a great thing to
 
00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
say but
 
00:41:39.109 --> 00:41:39.119 align:start position:0%
um some kids will then only be allowed a
 
00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
sun butter sandwich
 
00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
some kids will
 
00:41:46.069 --> 00:41:46.079 align:start position:0%
be denied and they'll say you have
 
00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
a little announcement will go off at the
 
00:41:49.349 --> 00:41:49.359 align:start position:0%
register that says you have a high
 
00:41:49.359 --> 00:41:50.630 align:start position:0%
register that says you have a high
balance

00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:50.640 align:start position:0%
balance
 
00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:52.720 align:start position:0%
um and you can't receive your lunch and
 
00:41:54.550 --> 00:41:54.560 align:start position:0%
we've also heard stories and these are
 
00:41:56.550 --> 00:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
stories so i can't and i don't know um
 
00:41:57.829 --> 00:41:57.839 align:start position:0%
which school districts but these are
 
00:42:00.630 --> 00:42:00.640 align:start position:0%
stories um that food service staff have
 
00:42:02.470 --> 00:42:02.480 align:start position:0%
thrown away the lunch when the student
 
00:42:04.630 --> 00:42:04.640 align:start position:0%
gets there and they have too high of a
 
00:42:07.750 --> 00:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
balance to receive the meal
 
00:42:11.430 --> 00:42:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
representative ellison
 
00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:14.069 align:start position:0%
representative ellison
uh

00:42:14.069 --> 00:42:14.079 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:42:17.109 --> 00:42:17.119 align:start position:0%
following up on that uh if the waivers
 
00:42:19.430 --> 00:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
go away are we back to
 
00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:20.790 align:start position:0%
go away are we back to
then

00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:20.800 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
which parents fill out the forms and
 
00:42:24.790 --> 00:42:24.800 align:start position:0%
which ones don't i mean back which is
 
00:42:27.030 --> 00:42:27.040 align:start position:0%
the situation we had for years anyway is
 
00:42:28.950 --> 00:42:28.960 align:start position:0%
that correct that is correct so that was
 
00:42:30.870 --> 00:42:30.880 align:start position:0%
kind of the disappointment of um the
 
00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:32.960 align:start position:0%
medicaid direct certification bill not
 
00:42:34.309 --> 00:42:34.319 align:start position:0%
passing this year
 
00:42:36.390 --> 00:42:36.400 align:start position:0%
um we're still trying to the
 
00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
application's not due until september so
 
00:42:39.829 --> 00:42:39.839 align:start position:0%
if we can figure out a way to get the
 
00:42:39.839 --> 00:42:41.030 align:start position:0%
if we can figure out a way to get the
approval

00:42:41.030 --> 00:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
approval
 
00:42:43.589 --> 00:42:43.599 align:start position:0%
for doe and dhhs to fill that form out
 
00:42:43.599 --> 00:42:44.790 align:start position:0%
for doe and dhhs to fill that form out
um

00:42:44.790 --> 00:42:44.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:46.470 --> 00:42:46.480 align:start position:0%
then we would
 
00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
in the 2023-2024
 
00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
school year would use medicaid direct
 
00:42:55.670 --> 00:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
certification as the eligibility
 
00:42:57.430 --> 00:42:57.440 align:start position:0%
measurement versus
 
00:42:59.109 --> 00:42:59.119 align:start position:0%
having to fill out the form
 
00:43:01.750 --> 00:43:01.760 align:start position:0%
and do the waivers are they going to at
 
00:43:03.670 --> 00:43:03.680 align:start position:0%
this point without further congressional
 
00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:04.630 align:start position:0%
this point without further congressional
action

00:43:04.630 --> 00:43:04.640 align:start position:0%
action
 
00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
going away this june or next year this
 
00:43:11.349 --> 00:43:11.359 align:start position:0%
june 30th this month yeah thank you
 
00:43:14.309 --> 00:43:14.319 align:start position:0%
and i'll just you know not to go down
 
00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
a rabbit hole but i'll just flag for the
 
00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
committee that
 
00:43:20.870 --> 00:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
um that the
 
00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
the way that we measure poverty in new
 
00:43:24.870 --> 00:43:24.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire turns on free and reduced
 
00:43:27.109 --> 00:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
meals um so
 
00:43:29.430 --> 00:43:29.440 align:start position:0%
uh you know it is significant that there
 
00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
are a number of parents you know who who
 
00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:35.200 align:start position:0%
can't or won't or are afraid to fill out
 
00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:38.640 align:start position:0%
free and reduced meal forms
 
00:43:40.630 --> 00:43:40.640 align:start position:0%
um you know not not just in the school
 
00:43:43.750 --> 00:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
meal space but in a whole range of
 
00:43:45.349 --> 00:43:45.359 align:start position:0%

um

00:43:59.030 --> 00:43:59.040 align:start position:0%

before us next week with some answers
 
00:47:08.950 --> 00:47:08.960 align:start position:0%

00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
developing the questions
 
00:47:13.349 --> 00:47:13.359 align:start position:0%
if not then at least we know
 
00:47:15.750 --> 00:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
they'll know uh what
 
00:47:19.109 --> 00:47:19.119 align:start position:0%
july and august will mean in terms of
 
00:47:20.710 --> 00:47:20.720 align:start position:0%
what kinds of things we're looking for
 
00:47:34.390 --> 00:47:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:36.710 --> 00:47:36.720 align:start position:0%
i was going to yell at you
 
00:47:38.870 --> 00:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
you should
 
00:47:42.069 --> 00:47:42.079 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of uh
 
00:47:45.430 --> 00:47:45.440 align:start position:0%
your perception of where we go we're
 
00:47:47.109 --> 00:47:47.119 align:start position:0%
we're looking then
 
00:47:47.119 --> 00:47:48.309 align:start position:0%
we're looking then
obviously

00:47:48.309 --> 00:47:48.319 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
00:47:52.069 --> 00:47:52.079 align:start position:0%
at the fall in a series of meetings and
 
00:47:54.069 --> 00:47:54.079 align:start position:0%
coming to some conclusions i would
 
00:47:56.390 --> 00:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
suspect before
 
00:47:58.790 --> 00:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
those of you who those of us who may or
 
00:48:01.030 --> 00:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
be re-elected or coming back in january
 
00:48:03.030 --> 00:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
that we would have a package we would
 
00:48:05.670 --> 00:48:05.680 align:start position:0%
have a recommendation for the committee
 
00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
prior to
 
00:48:09.270 --> 00:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
january 1st with that is that a fair
 
00:48:11.990 --> 00:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
assumption uh yes
 
00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:13.670 align:start position:0%
assumption uh yes
yes

00:48:13.670 --> 00:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:48:15.349 --> 00:48:15.359 align:start position:0%
certainly by
 
00:48:17.109 --> 00:48:17.119 align:start position:0%
the report i believe is due at the end
 
00:48:19.750 --> 00:48:19.760 align:start position:0%
of october so we have to have our
 
00:48:22.470 --> 00:48:22.480 align:start position:0%
interim study report in and
 
00:48:25.430 --> 00:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
what we will be doing is saying either
 
00:48:28.470 --> 00:48:28.480 align:start position:0%
yes we recommend future legislation or
 
00:48:32.069 --> 00:48:32.079 align:start position:0%
no we don't recommend future legislation
 
00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
that legislation does not necessarily
 
00:48:37.990 --> 00:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
need to have been written by then
 
00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
but certainly
 
00:48:42.390 --> 00:48:42.400 align:start position:0%
incumbent legislators
 
00:48:45.270 --> 00:48:45.280 align:start position:0%
can start with ols i believe the first
 
00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:47.200 align:start position:0%
week in september
 
00:48:49.670 --> 00:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
so i would think
 
00:48:51.750 --> 00:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
because i'm looking at representative
 
00:48:55.510 --> 00:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
horrigan who's nodding up and down our
 
00:49:00.069 --> 00:49:00.079 align:start position:0%
school meals cheerleader that um
 
00:49:02.150 --> 00:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
any any member of this committee or any
 
00:49:04.069 --> 00:49:04.079 align:start position:0%
other member of the general court who is
 
00:49:06.950 --> 00:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
running for reelection can certainly
 
00:49:10.230 --> 00:49:10.240 align:start position:0%
draft legislation based on what we hear
 
00:49:12.390 --> 00:49:12.400 align:start position:0%
as a part of the centrum study
 
00:49:15.190 --> 00:49:15.200 align:start position:0%
uh on their own and then the committee
 
00:49:17.510 --> 00:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
will need to decide whether or not you
 
00:49:18.630 --> 00:49:18.640 align:start position:0%
know it's a
 
00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
straight up yes we think that this needs
 
00:49:24.309 --> 00:49:24.319 align:start position:0%
additional legislation or uh
 
00:49:27.589 --> 00:49:27.599 align:start position:0%
no we don't for whatever reasons
 
00:49:30.549 --> 00:49:30.559 align:start position:0%
yeah does that make any sense
 
00:49:30.559 --> 00:49:31.510 align:start position:0%
yeah does that make any sense
okay

00:49:31.510 --> 00:49:31.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:49:33.190 --> 00:49:33.200 align:start position:0%
uh and and
 
00:49:35.109 --> 00:49:35.119 align:start position:0%
additionally regardless of what we
 
00:49:37.430 --> 00:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
recommend legislation may go forward on
 
00:49:39.589 --> 00:49:39.599 align:start position:0%
this topic i would anticipate that it
 
00:49:42.790 --> 00:49:42.800 align:start position:0%
would i uh you know the this
 
00:49:44.549 --> 00:49:44.559 align:start position:0%
we're a study committee
 
00:49:47.270 --> 00:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
so we're low on the totem pole
 
00:49:50.390 --> 00:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
um i would think that there will in fact
 
00:49:52.790 --> 00:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
be people who will
 
00:49:54.710 --> 00:49:54.720 align:start position:0%
on either side of the issue ultimately
 
00:49:56.150 --> 00:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
go forward
 
00:50:00.470 --> 00:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:01.430 align:start position:0%
 
oh

00:50:01.430 --> 00:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:50:04.230 --> 00:50:04.240 align:start position:0%
madam chair yes sir representative ford
 
00:50:07.030 --> 00:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
get where i can be heard um
 
00:50:08.710 --> 00:50:08.720 align:start position:0%
are we going to
 
00:50:12.230 --> 00:50:12.240 align:start position:0%
consider schools that are uh
 
00:50:14.230 --> 00:50:14.240 align:start position:0%
charter schools and things like that in
 
00:50:15.670 --> 00:50:15.680 align:start position:0%
addition to
 
00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:16.470 align:start position:0%
addition to
the

00:50:16.470 --> 00:50:16.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:50:18.710 --> 00:50:18.720 align:start position:0%
traditional public schools yeah i would
 
00:50:21.109 --> 00:50:21.119 align:start position:0%
think that we when the department of
 
00:50:21.119 --> 00:50:22.549 align:start position:0%
think that we when the department of
education

00:50:22.549 --> 00:50:22.559 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:50:24.150 --> 00:50:24.160 align:start position:0%
is with us
 
00:50:25.670 --> 00:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
one of the things that i would think
 
00:50:27.829 --> 00:50:27.839 align:start position:0%
that we would want to be looking at are
 
00:50:30.630 --> 00:50:30.640 align:start position:0%
school meals period yeah you know
 
00:50:33.030 --> 00:50:33.040 align:start position:0%
regardless of where those school meals
 
00:50:34.950 --> 00:50:34.960 align:start position:0%
because i i'm curious i want to know
 
00:50:37.270 --> 00:50:37.280 align:start position:0%
because we have some private schools in
 
00:50:39.190 --> 00:50:39.200 align:start position:0%
new hampshire that participate in the
 
00:50:41.670 --> 00:50:41.680 align:start position:0%
school meals program we have public
 
00:50:43.430 --> 00:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
schools in new hampshire that don't
 
00:50:46.069 --> 00:50:46.079 align:start position:0%
participate in this so i'm i i would
 
00:50:48.390 --> 00:50:48.400 align:start position:0%
really like the doe to use this
 
00:50:50.309 --> 00:50:50.319 align:start position:0%
opportunity to
 
00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
educate us on the variety of scenarios
 
00:50:55.670 --> 00:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
that are out there
 
00:50:57.829 --> 00:50:57.839 align:start position:0%
because i you know as i've said
 
00:51:00.150 --> 00:51:00.160 align:start position:0%
you you've heard me say that ad nauseam
 
00:51:02.230 --> 00:51:02.240 align:start position:0%
right a hungry child is a hungry child
 
00:51:04.549 --> 00:51:04.559 align:start position:0%
no matter where they live or where they
 
00:51:06.549 --> 00:51:06.559 align:start position:0%
attend school and we need to be looking
 
00:51:09.430 --> 00:51:09.440 align:start position:0%
at all of them i think i uh
 
00:51:11.190 --> 00:51:11.200 align:start position:0%
when i first got put on this committee
 
00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
began asking because this is outside my
 
00:51:15.750 --> 00:51:15.760 align:start position:0%
realm of experience
 
00:51:18.309 --> 00:51:18.319 align:start position:0%
since i was a child i've had no
 
00:51:20.390 --> 00:51:20.400 align:start position:0%
experience with this business except for
 
00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
running a kitchen when i was in college
 
00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:24.309 align:start position:0%
running a kitchen when i was in college
but

00:51:24.309 --> 00:51:24.319 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:51:28.549 --> 00:51:28.559 align:start position:0%
the whole funding and and the issue of
 
00:51:30.630 --> 00:51:30.640 align:start position:0%
call it shaming or whatever it might be
 
00:51:32.309 --> 00:51:32.319 align:start position:0%
of people who had to admit they couldn't
 
00:51:35.750 --> 00:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
afford to feed their children breakfast
 
00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:36.390 align:start position:0%
afford to feed their children breakfast
is

00:51:36.390 --> 00:51:36.400 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:51:38.630 --> 00:51:38.640 align:start position:0%
entirely new to me so i began asking
 
00:51:41.190 --> 00:51:41.200 align:start position:0%
around and i stumbled upon a lady who
 
00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:41.910 align:start position:0%
around and i stumbled upon a lady who
was

00:51:41.910 --> 00:51:41.920 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:43.270 align:start position:0%
was
running

00:51:43.270 --> 00:51:43.280 align:start position:0%
running
 
00:51:46.150 --> 00:51:46.160 align:start position:0%
a collective of
 
00:51:50.470 --> 00:51:50.480 align:start position:0%
70 or 80 homeschooling people our home
 
00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
type school things and she has already
 
00:51:56.950 --> 00:51:56.960 align:start position:0%
conducted a survey
 
00:52:01.270 --> 00:52:01.280 align:start position:0%
and given me 80 something responses
 
00:52:03.589 --> 00:52:03.599 align:start position:0%
to questions about meals and so forth
 
00:52:05.030 --> 00:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
and of course we can
 
00:52:06.790 --> 00:52:06.800 align:start position:0%
change the questions and send them back
 
00:52:08.470 --> 00:52:08.480 align:start position:0%
out and so forth but
 
00:52:10.710 --> 00:52:10.720 align:start position:0%
what i was basically saying i'm sure
 
00:52:12.710 --> 00:52:12.720 align:start position:0%
each of you has those same kinds of
 
00:52:15.190 --> 00:52:15.200 align:start position:0%
conducts contacts and that we might want
 
00:52:17.910 --> 00:52:17.920 align:start position:0%
to reach out and and find out you know
 
00:52:19.430 --> 00:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
just more because for me it's a
 
00:52:22.309 --> 00:52:22.319 align:start position:0%
discovery process from day one i mean i
 
00:52:24.470 --> 00:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
i i admit uh
 
00:52:27.030 --> 00:52:27.040 align:start position:0%
my knowledge is very slender on this and
 
00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:27.829 align:start position:0%
my knowledge is very slender on this and
so

00:52:27.829 --> 00:52:27.839 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:52:30.470 --> 00:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
yes i think it it needs to be i think
 
00:52:32.790 --> 00:52:32.800 align:start position:0%
the question is how much of it needs
 
00:52:35.589 --> 00:52:35.599 align:start position:0%
legislative address how much needs some
 
00:52:38.710 --> 00:52:38.720 align:start position:0%
other form of address or even just full
 
00:52:40.470 --> 00:52:40.480 align:start position:0%
public conversation
 
00:52:42.630 --> 00:52:42.640 align:start position:0%
about that as an issue
 
00:52:45.270 --> 00:52:45.280 align:start position:0%
and uh you know i quite agree that that
 
00:52:47.190 --> 00:52:47.200 align:start position:0%
this is something that we certainly
 
00:52:48.790 --> 00:52:48.800 align:start position:0%
ought to be able to get to a point where
 
00:52:51.030 --> 00:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
we can say this something needs to be
 
00:52:53.109 --> 00:52:53.119 align:start position:0%
done we're not sure what but
 
00:52:55.270 --> 00:52:55.280 align:start position:0%
you know this needs to be addressed and
 
00:52:58.230 --> 00:52:58.240 align:start position:0%
considered yeah i don't um
 
00:53:00.790 --> 00:53:00.800 align:start position:0%
i really
 
00:53:02.950 --> 00:53:02.960 align:start position:0%
homeschooled students i think may fall
 
00:53:06.230 --> 00:53:06.240 align:start position:0%
under a different category than
 
00:53:08.950 --> 00:53:08.960 align:start position:0%
federally funded public school programs
 
00:53:10.710 --> 00:53:10.720 align:start position:0%
charter schools or public schools in new
 
00:53:13.349 --> 00:53:13.359 align:start position:0%
hampshire so that's that they're already
 
00:53:15.670 --> 00:53:15.680 align:start position:0%
in the bucket in terms of they may have
 
00:53:17.829 --> 00:53:17.839 align:start position:0%
different rules and regulations but in
 
00:53:19.829 --> 00:53:19.839 align:start position:0%
terms of the eligibility is being
 
00:53:22.390 --> 00:53:22.400 align:start position:0%
considered as a public school right the
 
00:53:25.349 --> 00:53:25.359 align:start position:0%
charter schools won't be uh won't be uh
 
00:53:26.950 --> 00:53:26.960 align:start position:0%
there was some discussion in the
 
00:53:28.950 --> 00:53:28.960 align:start position:0%
committee earlier when later people were
 
00:53:30.630 --> 00:53:30.640 align:start position:0%
asking questions they're legitimate
 
00:53:32.790 --> 00:53:32.800 align:start position:0%
questions should they be required to
 
00:53:34.710 --> 00:53:34.720 align:start position:0%
meet the same standards when they have a
 
00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:35.670 align:start position:0%
meet the same standards when they have a
lunch

00:53:35.670 --> 00:53:35.680 align:start position:0%
lunch
 
00:53:38.150 --> 00:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
compared to that and so all right that's
 
00:53:40.069 --> 00:53:40.079 align:start position:0%
a question that needs to be answered
 
00:53:43.430 --> 00:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
absolutely yeah and and i i don't have
 
00:53:45.190 --> 00:53:45.200 align:start position:0%
an opinion i'm sure they haven't i
 
00:53:47.030 --> 00:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
haven't read any of the responses i've
 
00:53:49.270 --> 00:53:49.280 align:start position:0%
gotten yet i just got them last night
 
00:53:51.589 --> 00:53:51.599 align:start position:0%
last night but i think that these are
 
00:53:54.150 --> 00:53:54.160 align:start position:0%
things that we might explore just
 
00:53:56.549 --> 00:53:56.559 align:start position:0%
because we don't know the answer you bet
 
00:53:59.349 --> 00:53:59.359 align:start position:0%
yeah yep um i i hear your representative
 
00:54:01.349 --> 00:54:01.359 align:start position:0%
for it and uh i'm game for the
 
00:54:03.270 --> 00:54:03.280 align:start position:0%
discussion what
 
00:54:06.710 --> 00:54:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:11.589 --> 00:54:11.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:13.589 --> 00:54:13.599 align:start position:0%
the starting point is clearly we need to
 
00:54:16.309 --> 00:54:16.319 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that there is a problem
 
00:54:18.230 --> 00:54:18.240 align:start position:0%
right i mean
 
00:54:19.829 --> 00:54:19.839 align:start position:0%
that's the bottom line that we have a
 
00:54:24.309 --> 00:54:24.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:25.670 --> 00:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that everybody agrees
 
00:54:30.309 --> 00:54:30.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:30.319 --> 00:54:32.549 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:54:32.549 --> 00:54:32.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:34.150 --> 00:54:34.160 align:start position:0%
in terms of whether or not we have the
 
00:54:37.510 --> 00:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
responsibility to feed hungry children
 
00:54:39.190 --> 00:54:39.200 align:start position:0%
well i think we
 
00:54:40.950 --> 00:54:40.960 align:start position:0%
i'm saying start with the idea the
 
00:54:43.109 --> 00:54:43.119 align:start position:0%
notion that we do have hungry children
 
00:54:45.109 --> 00:54:45.119 align:start position:0%
yeah that was a question i was asking
 
00:54:47.190 --> 00:54:47.200 align:start position:0%
you is that what you're saying oh yeah
 
00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:56.069 align:start position:0%
you is that what you're saying oh yeah
yeah

00:54:56.069 --> 00:54:56.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:00.630 --> 00:55:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:03.030 --> 00:55:03.040 align:start position:0%
as i said representative ford i'm game
 
00:55:04.950 --> 00:55:04.960 align:start position:0%
for the discussion
 
00:55:06.710 --> 00:55:06.720 align:start position:0%
thinking of that kid that comes over and
 
00:55:08.390 --> 00:55:08.400 align:start position:0%
eats all the stuff in your fridge with
 
00:55:10.549 --> 00:55:10.559 align:start position:0%
you and your kids and them
 
00:55:12.710 --> 00:55:12.720 align:start position:0%
are sitting there having snacks after
 
00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:14.789 align:start position:0%
are sitting there having snacks after
cooling

00:55:14.789 --> 00:55:14.799 align:start position:0%
cooling
 
00:55:18.829 --> 00:55:18.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:21.030 --> 00:55:21.040 align:start position:0%
yeah well i'm
 
00:55:25.109 --> 00:55:25.119 align:start position:0%
i feel fairly confident that
 
00:55:27.670 --> 00:55:27.680 align:start position:0%
the refrigerator in in the in the school
 
00:55:30.230 --> 00:55:30.240 align:start position:0%
building probably has a lock on it so
 
00:55:33.589 --> 00:55:33.599 align:start position:0%
nobody's coming in after practice and uh
 
00:55:36.069 --> 00:55:36.079 align:start position:0%
and eating out of that refrigerator but
 
00:55:38.309 --> 00:55:38.319 align:start position:0%
uh you know i do think that we have to
 
00:55:42.309 --> 00:55:42.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:44.950 --> 00:55:44.960 align:start position:0%
whether we like it or not we have to
 
00:55:48.309 --> 00:55:48.319 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that there are hungry kids
 
00:55:50.230 --> 00:55:50.240 align:start position:0%
and that it's through no fault of their
 
00:55:50.240 --> 00:55:52.150 align:start position:0%
and that it's through no fault of their
own

00:55:52.150 --> 00:55:52.160 align:start position:0%
own
 
00:55:52.160 --> 00:55:53.589 align:start position:0%
own
so

00:55:53.589 --> 00:55:53.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:55:55.750 --> 00:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
what do we what do we do you know food
 
00:55:58.630 --> 00:55:58.640 align:start position:0%
insecurity is is
 
00:56:01.510 --> 00:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
a quasi disability you know
 
00:56:03.750 --> 00:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
food insecurity affects
 
00:56:07.750 --> 00:56:07.760 align:start position:0%
how you approach the day that you're in
 
00:56:10.150 --> 00:56:10.160 align:start position:0%
and if it's chronic food insecurity i
 
00:56:11.910 --> 00:56:11.920 align:start position:0%
mean i'm sure that we could
 
00:56:14.309 --> 00:56:14.319 align:start position:0%
sit here and listen to
 
00:56:17.430 --> 00:56:17.440 align:start position:0%
thousands of stories of
 
00:56:19.910 --> 00:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
siblings taking care of younger children
 
00:56:22.789 --> 00:56:22.799 align:start position:0%
of teachers taking care of students of
 
00:56:25.109 --> 00:56:25.119 align:start position:0%
neighbors taking you know
 
00:56:27.510 --> 00:56:27.520 align:start position:0%
um because we have populations that not
 
00:56:29.030 --> 00:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
only live in poverty but we have
 
00:56:32.150 --> 00:56:32.160 align:start position:0%
homeless pop populations we have
 
00:56:34.150 --> 00:56:34.160 align:start position:0%
populations of kids whose parents are
 
00:56:34.160 --> 00:56:35.670 align:start position:0%
populations of kids whose parents are
incarcerated

00:56:35.670 --> 00:56:35.680 align:start position:0%
incarcerated
 
00:56:37.190 --> 00:56:37.200 align:start position:0%
we uh
 
00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:40.069 align:start position:0%
we uh
so

00:56:40.069 --> 00:56:40.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:43.190 --> 00:56:43.200 align:start position:0%
this is i i want to i i want to to the
 
00:56:45.030 --> 00:56:45.040 align:start position:0%
best of our ability i want to focus on
 
00:56:46.950 --> 00:56:46.960 align:start position:0%
the child
 
00:56:48.950 --> 00:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
not on whether or not the mother or the
 
00:56:52.390 --> 00:56:52.400 align:start position:0%
father or grandparent or whatever is not
 
00:56:55.030 --> 00:56:55.040 align:start position:0%
doing what they're supposed to do
 
00:56:56.630 --> 00:56:56.640 align:start position:0%
i think what we need to focus on is the
 
00:56:58.789 --> 00:56:58.799 align:start position:0%
fact that we have hungry kids in the
 
00:57:00.230 --> 00:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
 
00:57:01.670 --> 00:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
and every morning i pick up the
 
00:57:03.990 --> 00:57:04.000 align:start position:0%
newspaper and there's another million
 
00:57:06.470 --> 00:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
dollars in surplus being touted on the
 
00:57:09.829 --> 00:57:09.839 align:start position:0%
front page of the paper and i'm thinking
 
00:57:11.829 --> 00:57:11.839 align:start position:0%
holy toledo you know we almost had a
 
00:57:15.190 --> 00:57:15.200 align:start position:0%
stroke when we saw 650 000 to feed
 
00:57:16.710 --> 00:57:16.720 align:start position:0%
hungry kids
 
00:57:19.190 --> 00:57:19.200 align:start position:0%
to feed all kids basically breakfast in
 
00:57:28.230 --> 00:57:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:30.710 --> 00:57:30.720 align:start position:0%
representative hall
 
00:57:32.309 --> 00:57:32.319 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and to follow up
 
00:57:33.990 --> 00:57:34.000 align:start position:0%
with your comment before yes i think it
 
00:57:36.069 --> 00:57:36.079 align:start position:0%
is our responsibility
 
00:57:37.510 --> 00:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
to um
 
00:57:39.270 --> 00:57:39.280 align:start position:0%
make sure that their kids are fed if not
 
00:57:42.230 --> 00:57:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:47.030 --> 00:57:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:48.470 --> 00:57:48.480 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
00:57:51.349 --> 00:57:51.359 align:start position:0%
again if you have specific information
 
00:57:53.670 --> 00:57:53.680 align:start position:0%

terrific because then that would at
 
00:58:05.750 --> 00:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:07.589 --> 00:58:07.599 align:start position:0%
