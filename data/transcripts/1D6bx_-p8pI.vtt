investigation and compliance within the
 
00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:46.680 align:start position:0%
Lottery Commission
 
00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:48.840 align:start position:0%
the bill creates a structure really a
 
00:07:49.909 --> 00:07:49.919 align:start position:0%
structure only
 
00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
to be staffed by existing
 
00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:55.620 align:start position:0%
employees this bill does not ask for
 
00:07:57.529 --> 00:07:57.539 align:start position:0%
additional staff it's very important to

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
duties of investigation and compliance
 
00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:07.500 align:start position:0%
again most of these Duties are being
 
00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:09.720 align:start position:0%
done today but he wants this caught a
 
00:08:12.409 --> 00:08:12.419 align:start position:0%
codified in law as to what the duty of
 
00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:16.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:18.660 align:start position:0%
the second thing it does it changes the
 
00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
way in which the lottery interacts with
 
00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:23.160 align:start position:0%
the AG's office when it comes to
 
00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:26.220 align:start position:0%
background checks required for licenses
 
00:08:29.089 --> 00:08:29.099 align:start position:0%
in short a lot of the lottery will do a
 
00:08:32.029 --> 00:08:32.039 align:start position:0%
lot of the data Gathering
 
00:08:36.769 --> 00:08:36.779 align:start position:0%
uh more closely with the AG's office but
 
00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:39.180 align:start position:0%
the AG's office will still have the
 
00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
final stay as to the fitness of an
 
00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
applicant that receives a license
 
00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:46.920 align:start position:0%
the thought behind this is that it will
 
00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:49.800 align:start position:0%
speed up the process if these people do
 
00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:51.420 align:start position:0%
this data Gathering
 
00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:54.180 align:start position:0%
uh and this is not taking any final
 
00:08:56.389 --> 00:08:56.399 align:start position:0%
Authority away from the AG's office in
 
00:08:57.829 --> 00:08:57.839 align:start position:0%
this this regard
 
00:09:00.769 --> 00:09:00.779 align:start position:0%
and the fourth thing is it uh it does
 
00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:03.360 align:start position:0%
give the investiga this division this
 
00:09:05.269 --> 00:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
new division of Investigation
 
00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:08.940 align:start position:0%
enforcement of the rule-making authority
 
00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:11.580 align:start position:0%
and the last thing and for new members
 
00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:14.580 align:start position:0%
uh I just want to spend a second uh
 
00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:16.260 align:start position:0%
using this bill to hopefully have the
 
00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:17.880 align:start position:0%
bill in front of you
 
00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:20.820 align:start position:0%
uh the first thing the creation of
 
00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:23.100 align:start position:0%
division is on page one of the Bell
 
00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:26.760 align:start position:0%
lines 1 to 22. what it does is it says
 
00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:28.310 align:start position:0%
lines 1 to 22. what it does is it says
amend

00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:28.320 align:start position:0%
amend
 
00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:30.360 align:start position:0%
by adding a new section so this is a
 
00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
whole new section of law
 
00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:36.500 align:start position:0%
the second the second portion is on page
 
00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
123p line 23 to 31 and page two line one
 
00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
to line 18.
 
00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:46.680 align:start position:0%
and it says it starts with amend section
 
00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:49.080 align:start position:0%
of statue this amends a section of
 
00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:49.970 align:start position:0%
of statue this amends a section of
statute

00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:49.980 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:52.680 align:start position:0%
and you will see bold italic that's the
 
00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:55.140 align:start position:0%
new words for this section and you'll
 
00:09:58.190 --> 00:09:58.200 align:start position:0%
see crossed out uh words and that is
 
00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:01.860 align:start position:0%
eliminating current words from statute
 
00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
and then if you go to uh line 19 to 23
 
00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:10.440 align:start position:0%
on on page two that is the proportion
 
00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
that adds new language new section to
 
00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
the current statute uh that gives them
 
00:10:18.769 --> 00:10:18.779 align:start position:0%
uh rule making Authority
 
00:10:20.449 --> 00:10:20.459 align:start position:0%
so it's important for new members to
 
00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:22.380 align:start position:0%
understand and again this is nothing new
 
00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:24.660 align:start position:0%
with the bill it's just me just pointing
 
00:10:26.329 --> 00:10:26.339 align:start position:0%
it out since I was the first stop on
 
00:10:26.339 --> 00:10:27.170 align:start position:0%
it out since I was the first stop on
this

00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:27.180 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:30.540 align:start position:0%
so uh the again and the final thing was
 
00:10:32.509 --> 00:10:32.519 align:start position:0%
the effective date which was January 1
 
00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:34.680 align:start position:0%
of 2022.
 
00:10:36.769 --> 00:10:36.779 align:start position:0%
you're going to come to find ways to
 
00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:37.860 align:start position:0%
meet members that there's a difference
 
00:10:39.769 --> 00:10:39.779 align:start position:0%
between applicability date and effective
 
00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:42.320 align:start position:0%
date so the law will be signed into law
 
00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:45.180 align:start position:0%
by let's say if we pass this probably in
 
00:10:47.569 --> 00:10:47.579 align:start position:0%
June or July about the signature of the
 
00:10:48.829 --> 00:10:48.839 align:start position:0%
governor for passes through the house
 
00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:50.540 align:start position:0%
and the Senate
 
00:10:53.389 --> 00:10:53.399 align:start position:0%
but the law is not effective
 
00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:57.000 align:start position:0%
until January 1st of 2022. that's what
 
00:10:58.069 --> 00:10:58.079 align:start position:0%
that means
 
00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:02.700 align:start position:0%
so with that uh I know uh
 
00:11:05.210 --> 00:11:05.220 align:start position:0%
executive director Charlie McIntyre is
 
00:11:07.069 --> 00:11:07.079 align:start position:0%
hopefully Mr chair we can hear from him
 
00:11:09.769 --> 00:11:09.779 align:start position:0%
next to explain a little further and uh
 
00:11:12.769 --> 00:11:12.779 align:start position:0%
I'll take questions but I think uh okay
 
00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
Tom oh
 
00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:17.640 align:start position:0%
so you'll take questions now yeah
 
00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
although uh yeah I'll take a few I think
 
00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:22.380 align:start position:0%
Charlie will do a better job explaining
 
00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:24.860 align:start position:0%
are there any questions
 
00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:30.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:33.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh I think it's a
 
00:11:35.569 --> 00:11:35.579 align:start position:0%
very important
 
00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
approach you're taking on this because
 
00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:40.680 align:start position:0%
of dealing with money uh we need
 
00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement to make sure people are
 
00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:44.160 align:start position:0%
following rules only question I have do
 
00:11:47.329 --> 00:11:47.339 align:start position:0%
you have a uh Financial note to go with
 
00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:50.420 align:start position:0%
this yet representative abrami again
 
00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:52.700 align:start position:0%
there's no because
 
00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
he's not asking for new positions here
 
00:11:58.670 --> 00:11:58.680 align:start position:0%
he's asking for this division to be
 
00:12:01.009 --> 00:12:01.019 align:start position:0%
codified in law this and he wants to
 
00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:02.820 align:start position:0%
create a formally created division now
 
00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:05.820 align:start position:0%
you can ask Charlie I mean executive
 
00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
director McIntyre uh that question as
 
00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
well but thank you my understanding is
 
00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
that it's just creating the structure
 
00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:15.240 align:start position:0%
is going to fill up with existing people
 
00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:17.940 align:start position:0%
now down the road he may ask for people
 
00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:19.620 align:start position:0%
but through the normal budget process
 
00:12:21.829 --> 00:12:21.839 align:start position:0%
through his budget request that would go
 
00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:23.820 align:start position:0%
to finance that's my understanding of
 
00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:26.100 align:start position:0%
the situation thank you any further
 
00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:27.050 align:start position:0%
the situation thank you any further
questions

00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:27.060 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:12:32.269 --> 00:12:32.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:32.279 --> 00:12:33.949 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:12:33.949 --> 00:12:33.959 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:42.720 align:start position:0%
is uh next would be Charlie McIntyre
 
00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:51.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:53.329 --> 00:12:53.339 align:start position:0%
Charlie McIntyre
 
00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
you gotta you gotta we gotta let him in
 
00:12:59.569 --> 00:12:59.579 align:start position:0%
I I just did it might take a second
 
00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:01.740 align:start position:0%
good morning I'm I'm actually in it took
 
00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:03.420 align:start position:0%
it takes about three seconds
 
00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:12.060 align:start position:0%
can you folks hear me
 
00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:13.740 align:start position:0%
okay perfect
 
00:13:15.829 --> 00:13:15.839 align:start position:0%
so uh good morning Mr chairman members
 
00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:16.740 align:start position:0%
of the committee this is Charlie
 
00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:18.540 align:start position:0%
McIntyre New Hampshire lottery director
 
00:13:20.569 --> 00:13:20.579 align:start position:0%
and with me in my office is our chief
 
00:13:23.569 --> 00:13:23.579 align:start position:0%
compliance officer uh John Conforti to
 
00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
answer any questions you might have
 
00:13:28.269 --> 00:13:28.279 align:start position:0%
um fundamentally this is
 
00:13:30.829 --> 00:13:30.839 align:start position:0%
enhancing and codifying the area
 
00:13:32.509 --> 00:13:32.519 align:start position:0%
regarding an investigation and
 
00:13:35.269 --> 00:13:35.279 align:start position:0%
compliance and gambling in the state and
 
00:13:36.829 --> 00:13:36.839 align:start position:0%
doing a couple things as representative
 
00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:41.100 align:start position:0%
abrami correctly points out one is
 
00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:43.380 align:start position:0%
allowing us to do the investigation and
 
00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:45.480 align:start position:0%
background work for the AG's office so
 
00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:46.980 align:start position:0%
that we can do it and present it to them
 
00:13:48.889 --> 00:13:48.899 align:start position:0%
they still have the authority to say yes
 
00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:51.240 align:start position:0%
or no but certainly it would be a
 
00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
priority for us also we are steeped in
 
00:13:57.110 --> 00:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
gambling so we tend to know areas a
 
00:13:58.670 --> 00:13:58.680 align:start position:0%
little bit better
 
00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:00.660 align:start position:0%
um than they would it's so that it would
 
00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:03.420 align:start position:0%
be a faster turnaround for us and we
 
00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:06.120 align:start position:0%
take a burden off of them uh there's no
 
00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:08.760 align:start position:0%
additional requests for Staffing
 
00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:10.680 align:start position:0%
um based on the merger with charitable
 
00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:14.040 align:start position:0%
gambling and racing from four years ago
 
00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:16.260 align:start position:0%
we have increased the amount of staff to
 
00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:18.660 align:start position:0%
do this function so now there's about 12
 
00:14:21.949 --> 00:14:21.959 align:start position:0%
to do it regularly versus when I took it
 
00:14:23.329 --> 00:14:23.339 align:start position:0%
I think there were three
 
00:14:26.170 --> 00:14:26.180 align:start position:0%
so we're far more
 
00:14:29.509 --> 00:14:29.519 align:start position:0%
staffed up in investigation function
 
00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:31.380 align:start position:0%
um it also enhances penalties for
 
00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:34.260 align:start position:0%
illegal gambling under current law we
 
00:14:35.509 --> 00:14:35.519 align:start position:0%
have the authority to investigate
 
00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:37.380 align:start position:0%
illegal gambling and then do nothing
 
00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:39.660 align:start position:0%
with it which doesn't seem to make a
 
00:14:41.569 --> 00:14:41.579 align:start position:0%
whole lot of sense
 
00:14:44.509 --> 00:14:44.519 align:start position:0%
um and so there's that function as well
 
00:14:47.389 --> 00:14:47.399 align:start position:0%
and then there's an enhanced
 
00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:49.740 align:start position:0%
authorization to
 
00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:50.930 align:start position:0%
authorization to
um

00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:50.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:52.620 align:start position:0%
connect with other law enforcement
 
00:14:54.889 --> 00:14:54.899 align:start position:0%
receive information from them
 
00:14:57.170 --> 00:14:57.180 align:start position:0%
um is part of the bill so that's our
 
00:14:59.449 --> 00:14:59.459 align:start position:0%
request uh like I said happy to answer
 
00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:03.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:06.180 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
 
00:15:08.389 --> 00:15:08.399 align:start position:0%
representative schanberg thank you Mr
 
00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:10.680 align:start position:0%

00:15:12.949 --> 00:15:12.959 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
if the day comes
 
00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:16.620 align:start position:0%
when you need an increase in this
 
00:15:19.569 --> 00:15:19.579 align:start position:0%
division of investigators
 
00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
will that be automatically done within
 
00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:24.240 align:start position:0%
your office or will you return to one of
 
00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:28.009 --> 00:15:28.019 align:start position:0%
um actually that's a good question
 
00:15:30.769 --> 00:15:30.779 align:start position:0%
representative so um we have a number of
 
00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
open positions that are funded that we
 
00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:34.680 align:start position:0%
haven't filled yet because we didn't see
 
00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:35.940 align:start position:0%
a need
 
00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:38.100 align:start position:0%
um we're not you know fans of just staff
 
00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:39.240 align:start position:0%
and folks because we have to open
 
00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:41.880 align:start position:0%
positions we use them judiciously as you
 
00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:45.480 align:start position:0%
can imagine so absent an expansion of
 
00:15:47.389 --> 00:15:47.399 align:start position:0%
gambling we wouldn't need to come back
 
00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:49.380 align:start position:0%
to the legislature for additional
 
00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:50.569 align:start position:0%
to the legislature for additional
positions

00:15:50.569 --> 00:15:50.579 align:start position:0%
positions
 
00:15:53.689 --> 00:15:53.699 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chairman
 
00:15:57.650 --> 00:15:57.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:02.889 --> 00:16:02.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:04.680 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:07.150 align:start position:0%
all right
um

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:07.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:09.949 --> 00:16:09.959 align:start position:0%
representative Amanda
 
00:16:11.269 --> 00:16:11.279 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:15.300 align:start position:0%
thank you um director this is
 
00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:16.980 align:start position:0%
representative Amanda gorg and I have
 
00:16:18.889 --> 00:16:18.899 align:start position:0%
just a quick question for you
 
00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:21.240 align:start position:0%
um what can you share the conversations
 
00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:22.620 align:start position:0%
that you've had with the attorney
 
00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:25.980 align:start position:0%
generals uh and let us know what their
 
00:16:28.069 --> 00:16:28.079 align:start position:0%
thoughts are on this change
 
00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:30.420 align:start position:0%
so certainly um so our chief compliance
 
00:16:32.689 --> 00:16:32.699 align:start position:0%
officer John good 40 was formerly the
 
00:16:34.189 --> 00:16:34.199 align:start position:0%
AG's office and he had the conversation
 
00:16:37.249 --> 00:16:37.259 align:start position:0%
so he'll answer for us sure so we we did
 
00:16:38.629 --> 00:16:38.639 align:start position:0%
have a conversation with the
 
00:16:41.269 --> 00:16:41.279 align:start position:0%
investigators who have been assisting us
 
00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
um and I think they're aware that this
 
00:16:46.189 --> 00:16:46.199 align:start position:0%
change is happening and from my
 
00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:47.820 align:start position:0%
understanding there isn't any objection
 
00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:50.220 align:start position:0%
from um from the Department of Justice
 
00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:52.860 align:start position:0%
at this point in time I know that at
 
00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
presently the investigations that we
 
00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
send over are
 
00:16:59.689 --> 00:16:59.699 align:start position:0%
um our lower priority for them obviously
 
00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:01.740 align:start position:0%
uh given the other uh very important
 
00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:03.420 align:start position:0%
work that they do
 
00:17:06.409 --> 00:17:06.419 align:start position:0%
um and so again as uh director McIntyre
 
00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:08.640 align:start position:0%
said this isn't taking them out of the
 
00:17:10.309 --> 00:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
equation for the decision making it's
 
00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
just taking some of the legwork off of
 
00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:15.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:17.220 align:start position:0%
right and there's been nobody from the
 
00:17:20.169 --> 00:17:20.179 align:start position:0%
ages officer just signed up on this bill
 
00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:23.240 align:start position:0%
uh representative Ames
 
00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you this is for director
 
00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:31.340 align:start position:0%
McIntyre and my question relates to the
 
00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:33.049 align:start position:0%
McIntyre and my question relates to the
subparagraph

00:17:33.049 --> 00:17:33.059 align:start position:0%
subparagraph
 
00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:39.320 align:start position:0%
for of node 284 3A that uh sets up a
 
00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:41.880 align:start position:0%
system for
 
00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
uh petitioning for Equity relief with
 
00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:47.820 align:start position:0%
the superior court for uh pen enhanced
 
00:17:51.049 --> 00:17:51.059 align:start position:0%
penalty uh not to see a fifty thousand
 
00:17:54.409 --> 00:17:54.419 align:start position:0%
dollars per violation and uh could you
 
00:17:57.289 --> 00:17:57.299 align:start position:0%
uh sort of fully explain that you you
 
00:18:00.049 --> 00:18:00.059 align:start position:0%
referred to this new Authority but I'd
 
00:18:03.409 --> 00:18:03.419 align:start position:0%
like to know the uh the reasoning and
 
00:18:06.169 --> 00:18:06.179 align:start position:0%
what's new about it as compared with
 
00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:08.700 align:start position:0%
where you are now great we're glad John
 
00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:11.400 align:start position:0%
sure uh representative this is Jonathan
 
00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
for you again I'm going to jump in and
 
00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
answer that question so the thought
 
00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:18.360 align:start position:0%
process behind this is uh presently
 
00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
there is some finding Authority uh with
 
00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
respect to certain violations but they
 
00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:24.289 align:start position:0%
respect to certain violations but they
are

00:18:24.289 --> 00:18:24.299 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:18:25.549 --> 00:18:25.559 align:start position:0%
um very
 
00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:28.980 align:start position:0%
um the the dollar amounts are very small
 
00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:31.980 align:start position:0%
um and so there it was a concern that
 
00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:35.640 align:start position:0%
um as charitable gaming May uh get uh
 
00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:36.950 align:start position:0%
um as charitable gaming May uh get uh
larger

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
larger
 
00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:38.280 align:start position:0%
um that some of the fines would be
 
00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
effective uh would be ineffective uh as
 
00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:45.440 align:start position:0%
a turn so this section
 
00:18:48.049 --> 00:18:48.059 align:start position:0%
basically permits us to go over the
 
00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
existing fine structure by going to
 
00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:53.700 align:start position:0%
court that will be fleshed out
 
00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
completely within rulemaking in terms of
 
00:18:59.810 --> 00:18:59.820 align:start position:0%
uh what what would uh what would
 
00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
constitute an enhanced uh penalty under
 
00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
the statute
 
00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:07.260 align:start position:0%
um what we are what we anticipate would
 
00:19:10.909 --> 00:19:10.919 align:start position:0%
be things like repeated violations uh or
 
00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:12.600 align:start position:0%
or things that strike at the very heart
 
00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:14.820 align:start position:0%
of the Integrity of the charitable
 
00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:16.760 align:start position:0%
gaming or the charitable gaming system
 
00:19:19.669 --> 00:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
and that would permit us uh of course
 
00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
with the assistance of the Attorney
 
00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
General's office to go to court and get
 
00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:25.980 align:start position:0%
a very particular relief that isn't
 
00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:28.200 align:start position:0%
available to us within the current
 
00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:30.900 align:start position:0%
statutory framework
 
00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
Charlie you might have done this but
 
00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
could you re-identify the person that
 
00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
just spoke oh certainly sorry it's uh
 
00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:43.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:47.700 align:start position:0%
next questions from representative John
 
00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:52.150 align:start position:0%
next questions from representative John
Janine

00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:55.500 align:start position:0%
hi James thank you Mr chairman
 
00:19:57.770 --> 00:19:57.780 align:start position:0%
um my my question is uh more of a
 
00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:00.720 align:start position:0%
general nature is there was there any
 
00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:03.240 align:start position:0%
one event that that triggered the need
 
00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:05.940 align:start position:0%
for this bill or is it kind of a sense
 
00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:08.580 align:start position:0%
that gambling operations are growing and
 
00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:11.220 align:start position:0%
there needs to be more oversight or
 
00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:13.380 align:start position:0%
something else yeah representative thank
 
00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:14.150 align:start position:0%
something else yeah representative thank
you

00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:14.160 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:15.900 align:start position:0%
for the more of the latter
 
00:20:18.289 --> 00:20:18.299 align:start position:0%
um certainly I I took over this agency
 
00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
10 years ago and we were doing 200
 
00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:22.860 align:start position:0%
million dollars a year in revenue and
 
00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
this year we'll perhaps in terms of
 
00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:27.240 align:start position:0%
overall betting it'll across a billion
 
00:20:30.169 --> 00:20:30.179 align:start position:0%
dollars all all in sports betting
 
00:20:31.669 --> 00:20:31.679 align:start position:0%
charitable gambling
 
00:20:34.549 --> 00:20:34.559 align:start position:0%
Kino internet traditional lottery so
 
00:20:34.559 --> 00:20:35.930 align:start position:0%
Kino internet traditional lottery so
it's

00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:35.940 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:20:38.150 --> 00:20:38.160 align:start position:0%
it's hard to scale the business and this
 
00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
is part of that scaling up is really
 
00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:41.220 align:start position:0%
enhancing our compliance and
 
00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:43.320 align:start position:0%
investigation function which in any
 
00:20:45.289 --> 00:20:45.299 align:start position:0%
gambling operation is a critical
 
00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
function it's one of the three major
 
00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:50.220 align:start position:0%
functions you would have so it's more to
 
00:20:52.909 --> 00:20:52.919 align:start position:0%
their latter Point representative
 
00:20:58.490 --> 00:20:58.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
no no follow-up I don't see any more
 
00:21:07.549 --> 00:21:07.559 align:start position:0%
hands raised
 
00:21:07.559 --> 00:21:16.810 align:start position:0%
hands raised
okay

00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:16.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:20.029 --> 00:21:20.039 align:start position:0%
you represented Spielberg thank you Mr
 
00:21:20.039 --> 00:21:20.990 align:start position:0%
you represented Spielberg thank you Mr
chairman

00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.549 align:start position:0%
chairman
uh

00:21:22.549 --> 00:21:22.559 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:21:24.529 --> 00:21:24.539 align:start position:0%
so it's my understanding that this
 
00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:26.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't really change the nature of
 
00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:28.140 align:start position:0%
enforcement it just shifts the
 
00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
responsibility from the Attorney
 
00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:32.220 align:start position:0%
General's office into your office where
 
00:21:33.770 --> 00:21:33.780 align:start position:0%
it's going to get more urgency and more
 
00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:34.909 align:start position:0%
it's going to get more urgency and more
Focus

00:21:34.909 --> 00:21:34.919 align:start position:0%
Focus
 
00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:37.740 align:start position:0%
and that seems fine to me my question is
 
00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:40.440 align:start position:0%
what is the special fund
 
00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:43.580 align:start position:0%
established in RSA 284
 
00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:47.400 align:start position:0%
21-j into which fines are deposited
 
00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:49.320 align:start position:0%
that's our that's our normal that's
 
00:21:51.770 --> 00:21:51.780 align:start position:0%
education fund so that's the fund all of
 
00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
our revenues are deposited into from
 
00:21:56.450 --> 00:21:56.460 align:start position:0%
which our expenses are
 
00:21:59.090 --> 00:21:59.100 align:start position:0%
paid and then the residual is left over
 
00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:01.200 align:start position:0%
for the education trust fund transfer
 
00:22:06.529 --> 00:22:06.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:08.580 align:start position:0%

there are about 750 licensees
 
00:23:10.490 --> 00:23:10.500 align:start position:0%
working in that industry we support over

annually going to Charities from these
 
00:23:22.789 --> 00:23:22.799 align:start position:0%
rooms and we are here uh to briefly uh
 
00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
support this legislation the the number
 
00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:28.310 align:start position:0%
support this legislation the the number
one

00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:32.460 align:start position:0%
um item of importance in any gambling is
 
00:23:35.870 --> 00:23:35.880 align:start position:0%
integrity and that it's imperative that
 
00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:39.000 align:start position:0%
the public and Regulators legislators
 
00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:42.240 align:start position:0%
are confident that any gambling whether
 
00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
it be
 
00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:46.200 align:start position:0%
in Las Vegas Atlantic City or Manchester
 
00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that there is integrity in
 
00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
the game and we are committed
 
00:23:53.690 --> 00:23:53.700 align:start position:0%
uh to seeing that that happens I think
 
00:23:55.970 --> 00:23:55.980 align:start position:0%
just to give you one example of a change
 
00:23:58.490 --> 00:23:58.500 align:start position:0%
that is of substance in this bill the
 
00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:01.740 align:start position:0%
current law direct mentioned it I just
 
00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:04.740 align:start position:0%
want to re re-emphasize it is that
 
00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:06.289 align:start position:0%
want to re re-emphasize it is that
currently

00:24:06.289 --> 00:24:06.299 align:start position:0%
currently
 
00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
while there are certainly illegal
 
00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:11.220 align:start position:0%
gambling is illegal there have been
 
00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
times when there's been
 
00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
suspected illegal gambling and it really
 
00:24:16.850 --> 00:24:16.860 align:start position:0%
while you can point it out there's
 
00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:19.260 align:start position:0%
nothing anyone can do about it this bill
 
00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:21.240 align:start position:0%
gives some specific authority to the
 
00:24:22.549 --> 00:24:22.559 align:start position:0%
Lottery Commission
 
00:24:25.669 --> 00:24:25.679 align:start position:0%
to be able to enforce and penalize those
 
00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:29.460 align:start position:0%
who might engage in illegal gambling
 
00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
um so I I believe that this is a very
 
00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
good change uh it will make enforcement
 
00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:38.940 align:start position:0%
efficient and our members support it
 
00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:40.490 align:start position:0%
efficient and our members support it
wholeheartedly

00:24:40.490 --> 00:24:40.500 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly
 
00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:44.100 align:start position:0%

00:28:08.330 --> 00:28:08.340 align:start position:0%
representative from Belknap County
 
00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:11.100 align:start position:0%

Guilford and Meredith
 
00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
I'm the prime sponsor of the bill and
 
00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
there are numerous co-sponsors in the
 
00:28:20.090 --> 00:28:20.100 align:start position:0%
house and a couple from the Senate
 
00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
what the bill seeks to do is to
 
00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:25.980 align:start position:0%
currently the interest in dividends tax
 
00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
which we've had for a long time in New
 
00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is a flat five percent above a
 
00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:31.430 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is a flat five percent above a
threshold

00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
threshold
 
00:28:33.649 --> 00:28:33.659 align:start position:0%
the threshold has varied right now the
 
00:28:36.110 --> 00:28:36.120 align:start position:0%
threshold is uh twenty four hundred
 
00:28:37.909 --> 00:28:37.919 align:start position:0%
dollars for an individual and double
 
00:28:39.769 --> 00:28:39.779 align:start position:0%
that for a married couple
 
00:28:42.049 --> 00:28:42.059 align:start position:0%
the bill would increase the throughout
 
00:28:43.850 --> 00:28:43.860 align:start position:0%
the filing threshold it would double it
 
00:28:48.409 --> 00:28:48.419 align:start position:0%
next year triple it in 2023 quadruple it
 
00:28:51.529 --> 00:28:51.539 align:start position:0%
in 2024 and in 2025 the tax would
 
00:28:53.210 --> 00:28:53.220 align:start position:0%
disappear entirely
 
00:28:58.610 --> 00:28:58.620 align:start position:0%
the um right now there are six states in
 
00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:00.360 align:start position:0%
the country that have no personal income
 
00:29:03.169 --> 00:29:03.179 align:start position:0%
tax and 11 that have a personal income
 
00:29:04.909 --> 00:29:04.919 align:start position:0%
tax with a rate lower than our five
 
00:29:07.029 --> 00:29:07.039 align:start position:0%
percent rate
 
00:29:11.630 --> 00:29:11.640 align:start position:0%
the revenues from the IND tax to the
 
00:29:13.549 --> 00:29:13.559 align:start position:0%
state based on the latest information
 
00:29:16.850 --> 00:29:16.860 align:start position:0%
from the dra from their website is that
 
00:29:20.510 --> 00:29:20.520 align:start position:0%
the only element of revenues that is
 
00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:24.120 align:start position:0%
smaller than the IND tax there's two the
 
00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:26.220 align:start position:0%
communications tax and the tobacco
 
00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:29.820 align:start position:0%
settlement right now uh total uh
 
00:29:33.169 --> 00:29:33.179 align:start position:0%
revenues from the IND tax are less than
 
00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
two percent of the total revenues
 
00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:37.130 align:start position:0%
two percent of the total revenues
so

00:29:37.130 --> 00:29:37.140 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:29:40.250 --> 00:29:40.260 align:start position:0%
what the problem is here is that this
 
00:29:42.529 --> 00:29:42.539 align:start position:0%
there's two problems one is
 
00:29:45.590 --> 00:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
on whom does the tax fall and the second
 
00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
is uh basically a truth in taxation type
 
00:29:50.570 --> 00:29:50.580 align:start position:0%
of argument
 
00:29:53.029 --> 00:29:53.039 align:start position:0%
we have been holding ourselves out in
 
00:29:55.070 --> 00:29:55.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire for a very long time as
 
00:29:57.470 --> 00:29:57.480 align:start position:0%
having no personal income tax but the
 
00:29:59.149 --> 00:29:59.159 align:start position:0%
reality is is that we do have a personal
 
00:30:02.149 --> 00:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
income tax and it's the IND tax
 
00:30:04.850 --> 00:30:04.860 align:start position:0%
um in fact chapter 77 of the RSA is
 
00:30:08.389 --> 00:30:08.399 align:start position:0%
entitled taxation of incomes so we're
 
00:30:10.850 --> 00:30:10.860 align:start position:0%
really misleading people who might
 
00:30:12.590 --> 00:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
consider moving to New Hampshire that we
 
00:30:14.149 --> 00:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
don't have a personal income tax when in
 
00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
fact we do
 
00:30:17.570 --> 00:30:17.580 align:start position:0%
um there's not a lot of there is a lot
 
00:30:19.909 --> 00:30:19.919 align:start position:0%
of anecdotal evidence that people might
 
00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
be deterred from moving to New Hampshire
 
00:30:23.649 --> 00:30:23.659 align:start position:0%
because of the IND tax particularly
 
00:30:25.970 --> 00:30:25.980 align:start position:0%
retirees who have substantial savings
 
00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
and Investments and I have personally
 
00:30:30.590 --> 00:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
been contacted by some people from out
 
00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
of state asking about the IND tax and
 
00:30:35.330 --> 00:30:35.340 align:start position:0%
whether it was ever going to be
 
00:30:37.370 --> 00:30:37.380 align:start position:0%
eliminated or you know repealed or
 
00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:39.480 align:start position:0%
reduced because they were thinking about
 
00:30:41.690 --> 00:30:41.700 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire versus Florida aside from
 
00:30:43.909 --> 00:30:43.919 align:start position:0%
weather considerations
 
00:30:48.769 --> 00:30:48.779 align:start position:0%
so basically uh what who gets who gets
 
00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:51.480 align:start position:0%
hit with the tax Savers investors
 
00:30:54.169 --> 00:30:54.179 align:start position:0%
seniors and retirees who have
 
00:30:56.029 --> 00:30:56.039 align:start position:0%
accumulated Investments on which they
 
00:30:59.870 --> 00:30:59.880 align:start position:0%
rely to live so the people who can
 
00:31:01.970 --> 00:31:01.980 align:start position:0%
probably least afford to pay the tax or
 
00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
who am I just up and move to another
 
00:31:05.570 --> 00:31:05.580 align:start position:0%
state without such an onerous tax get
 
00:31:08.510 --> 00:31:08.520 align:start position:0%
hit with a tax it's a very small portion
 
00:31:12.169 --> 00:31:12.179 align:start position:0%
of our state's Revenue uh it contributes
 
00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:14.640 align:start position:0%
to misleading the public I see ads
 
00:31:16.789 --> 00:31:16.799 align:start position:0%
sometimes On The Wall Street Journal for
 
00:31:18.889 --> 00:31:18.899 align:start position:0%
from real estate brokers advertising
 
00:31:20.510 --> 00:31:20.520 align:start position:0%
properties in New Hampshire and one of
 
00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:21.960 align:start position:0%
the reasons I say why to move to New
 
00:31:23.570 --> 00:31:23.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is we have no personal income
 
00:31:25.310 --> 00:31:25.320 align:start position:0%
tax well we know that's that's just not
 
00:31:27.769 --> 00:31:27.779 align:start position:0%
true so what we're trying to do is
 
00:31:31.549 --> 00:31:31.559 align:start position:0%
basically conform our tax policy to what
 
00:31:33.649 --> 00:31:33.659 align:start position:0%
we've been saying it is which is that we
 
00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
have no personal income tax
 
00:31:38.389 --> 00:31:38.399 align:start position:0%
um do we continue to misrepresent to the
 
00:31:39.529 --> 00:31:39.539 align:start position:0%
rest of the world that we have no
 
00:31:41.930 --> 00:31:41.940 align:start position:0%
personal income tax and my view is that
 
00:31:44.510 --> 00:31:44.520 align:start position:0%
we should not uh it is a very small
 
00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
portion of our revenues and we should uh
 
00:31:51.529 --> 00:31:51.539 align:start position:0%
engender trust in our citizens by
 
00:31:54.409 --> 00:31:54.419 align:start position:0%
saying the truth and doing the tax the
 
00:31:57.409 --> 00:31:57.419 align:start position:0%
tax policy should be truthful I'm sure
 
00:31:59.510 --> 00:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
there are other arguments that can be
 
00:32:02.149 --> 00:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
made on both sides of this but there is
 
00:32:05.450 --> 00:32:05.460 align:start position:0%
a lot of support for phasing us out we
 
00:32:08.570 --> 00:32:08.580 align:start position:0%
can wean ourselves off this text over a
 
00:32:11.810 --> 00:32:11.820 align:start position:0%
period of four years uh I would in 2017
 
00:32:14.149 --> 00:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
I introduced a bill that would have
 
00:32:16.669 --> 00:32:16.679 align:start position:0%
basically wiped out the tax in one swoop
 
00:32:19.730 --> 00:32:19.740 align:start position:0%
and that did not appeal to anyone so
 
00:32:21.529 --> 00:32:21.539 align:start position:0%
this way the way it's designed by
 
00:32:22.970 --> 00:32:22.980 align:start position:0%
increasing the filing threshold
 
00:32:25.789 --> 00:32:25.799 align:start position:0%
gradually over three years in the fourth
 
00:32:28.250 --> 00:32:28.260 align:start position:0%
year of repeal we can wean ourselves off
 
00:32:30.649 --> 00:32:30.659 align:start position:0%
because we can see how what the revenue
 
00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:32.760 align:start position:0%
decline is and adjust the budget
 
00:32:34.850 --> 00:32:34.860 align:start position:0%
accordingly so that's the reason for
 
00:32:39.289 --> 00:32:39.299 align:start position:0%
this I would like to see uh an ODP from
 
00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:41.880 align:start position:0%
the committee on this and I'm available
 
00:32:45.769 --> 00:32:45.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:48.120 align:start position:0%
okay any questions for the represent
 
00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:58.210 align:start position:0%
okay any questions for the represent
inside

00:32:58.210 --> 00:32:58.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:02.330 --> 00:33:02.340 align:start position:0%
the next we will go to Greg Moore right
 
00:33:05.090 --> 00:33:05.100 align:start position:0%
as a lobbyist in American for prosperity
 
00:33:07.490 --> 00:33:07.500 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and supported the bill
 
00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:09.240 align:start position:0%
and wants to testify
 
00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:11.880 align:start position:0%
Greg Moore
 
00:33:15.289 --> 00:33:15.299 align:start position:0%
I don't see him on the attendees list is
 
00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:18.360 align:start position:0%
it Aiden by chance
 
00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:24.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:30.610 --> 00:33:30.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:33.769 --> 00:33:33.779 align:start position:0%
I don't know
 
00:33:33.779 --> 00:33:34.789 align:start position:0%
I don't know
okay

00:33:34.789 --> 00:33:34.799 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:39.409 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:33:39.409 --> 00:33:39.419 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
let me try one more time
 
00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:43.130 align:start position:0%
let me try one more time
is

00:33:43.130 --> 00:33:43.140 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:33:54.590 --> 00:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:56.509 --> 00:33:56.519 align:start position:0%
it's like we've muted Maurice from The
 
00:33:58.070 --> 00:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission
 
00:33:59.450 --> 00:33:59.460 align:start position:0%
Aiden Moore is from The Liquor
 
00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:03.649 align:start position:0%
Aiden Moore is from The Liquor
Commission

00:34:03.649 --> 00:34:03.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:15.240 align:start position:0%
would you like me to move on to Devin
 
00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:25.810 align:start position:0%
would you like me to move on to Devin
Broderick

00:34:25.810 --> 00:34:25.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:30.169 --> 00:34:30.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:30.179 --> 00:34:33.909 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:34:33.909 --> 00:34:33.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:35.810 --> 00:34:35.820 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman members of the
 
00:34:37.430 --> 00:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Devin Roderick I'm
 
00:34:38.690 --> 00:34:38.700 align:start position:0%
a financial analyst with the New
 
00:34:40.250 --> 00:34:40.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Revenue tax
 
00:34:42.649 --> 00:34:42.659 align:start position:0%
policy legislative analysis group I'm
 
00:34:44.389 --> 00:34:44.399 align:start position:0%
also joined by Melissa Rollins I was
 
00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
hoping you could also promote her in
 
00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
case she needs answer any questions as
 
00:34:53.470 --> 00:34:53.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:55.790 --> 00:34:55.800 align:start position:0%
as uh representative silver had
 
00:35:00.070 --> 00:35:00.080 align:start position:0%
explained the proposed Bill increases
 
00:35:03.410 --> 00:35:03.420 align:start position:0%
both the filing threshold for the IND
 
00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:04.609 align:start position:0%
both the filing threshold for the IND
tax

00:35:04.609 --> 00:35:04.619 align:start position:0%
tax
 
00:35:07.130 --> 00:35:07.140 align:start position:0%
in basically three increments as well as
 
00:35:09.829 --> 00:35:09.839 align:start position:0%
increasing the exemptions that are
 
00:35:13.490 --> 00:35:13.500 align:start position:0%
provided for the IND tax those include
 
00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:16.270 align:start position:0%
provided for the IND tax those include
the

00:35:16.270 --> 00:35:16.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:19.320 align:start position:0%
exemption Force being 65 years of age or
 
00:35:22.490 --> 00:35:22.500 align:start position:0%
older is also a blind exemption in a
 
00:35:24.170 --> 00:35:24.180 align:start position:0%
disabled exemption and those apply to
 
00:35:27.050 --> 00:35:27.060 align:start position:0%
both the principal Filer and the spouse
 
00:35:29.690 --> 00:35:29.700 align:start position:0%
for those who file joint returns
 
00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
it increases those exemptions like I
 
00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
said over three three taxable years
 
00:35:38.870 --> 00:35:38.880 align:start position:0%
and then eventually repeals the IND tax
 
00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
applicable to taxable periods beginning
 
00:35:44.810 --> 00:35:44.820 align:start position:0%
after December 31st 2024.
 
00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
there is no way for the Department of
 
00:35:48.530 --> 00:35:48.540 align:start position:0%
Revenue to determine the exact fiscal
 
00:35:50.210 --> 00:35:50.220 align:start position:0%
impact of increasing exemptions under
 
00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:52.440 align:start position:0%
the IND tax and repealing it all
 
00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:53.510 align:start position:0%
the IND tax and repealing it all
together

00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:55.200 align:start position:0%
hence in our fiscal note it was an
 
00:35:57.829 --> 00:35:57.839 align:start position:0%
indeterminable decrease in general fund
 
00:35:59.750 --> 00:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
Revenue such as where the IND tax is
 
00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:01.329 align:start position:0%
Revenue such as where the IND tax is
deposited

00:36:01.329 --> 00:36:01.339 align:start position:0%
deposited
 
00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:03.720 align:start position:0%
the department has no definitive method
 
00:36:06.170 --> 00:36:06.180 align:start position:0%
also to determine any future IND tax
 
00:36:07.730 --> 00:36:07.740 align:start position:0%
liability or credit carry forward
 
00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:09.050 align:start position:0%
liability or credit carry forward
amounts

00:36:09.050 --> 00:36:09.060 align:start position:0%
amounts
 
00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
however using available data from tax
 
00:36:14.690 --> 00:36:14.700 align:start position:0%
year 2019 we are able to estimate the
 
00:36:18.190 --> 00:36:18.200 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact from the proposed bill
 
00:36:23.450 --> 00:36:23.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:25.560 align:start position:0%
um tax year 2019 liabilities being
 
00:36:29.050 --> 00:36:29.060 align:start position:0%
reported by taxpayers as being
 
00:36:31.450 --> 00:36:31.460 align:start position:0%
113.8 million
 
00:36:34.730 --> 00:36:34.740 align:start position:0%
exemptions actually claimed in 2019 were
 
00:36:36.530 --> 00:36:36.540 align:start position:0%
used to estimate the proposed increases
 
00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
per year
 
00:36:40.310 --> 00:36:40.320 align:start position:0%
we also did an analysis based on prior
 
00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
years breakout to apply that tax year
 
00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
Revenue to a fiscal year basis
 
00:36:50.329 --> 00:36:50.339 align:start position:0%
um in the fiscal known and also in the
 
00:36:50.339 --> 00:36:51.050 align:start position:0%
um in the fiscal known and also in the
um

00:36:51.050 --> 00:36:51.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:53.810 --> 00:36:53.820 align:start position:0%
fiscal quick guide we attached a chart
 
00:36:57.230 --> 00:36:57.240 align:start position:0%
which shows the estimated revenue on a
 
00:37:00.050 --> 00:37:00.060 align:start position:0%
year-over-year basis as well as well as
 
00:37:02.270 --> 00:37:02.280 align:start position:0%
the cumulative fiscal impact eventually
 
00:37:06.530 --> 00:37:06.540 align:start position:0%
reaching the 113.8 million as mentioned
 
00:37:08.810 --> 00:37:08.820 align:start position:0%
a minute ago as being the tax year 19
 
00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
total liability
 
00:37:13.790 --> 00:37:13.800 align:start position:0%
just please note that our fiscal
 
00:37:15.950 --> 00:37:15.960 align:start position:0%
estimated fiscal impact does not take
 
00:37:17.569 --> 00:37:17.579 align:start position:0%
into account any overpayments or credit
 
00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:19.560 align:start position:0%
carry forwards on file the use of these
 
00:37:22.250 --> 00:37:22.260 align:start position:0%
overpayments could further increase the
 
00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
loss in Revenue as taxpayers stop making
 
00:37:25.430 --> 00:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
payments and supplement the payments
 
00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:26.640 align:start position:0%
with overpayments they haven't file
 
00:37:28.910 --> 00:37:28.920 align:start position:0%
before the taxes repealed
 
00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:30.720 align:start position:0%
we also have no way of determining how
 
00:37:31.910 --> 00:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
the taxpayer would utilize the
 
00:37:33.650 --> 00:37:33.660 align:start position:0%
overpayment whether they would use it or
 
00:37:35.390 --> 00:37:35.400 align:start position:0%
multiple years or they would claim it as
 
00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:38.520 align:start position:0%
a refund once the tax is repealed
 
00:37:40.310 --> 00:37:40.320 align:start position:0%
similarly similarly there could be
 
00:37:42.530 --> 00:37:42.540 align:start position:0%
trailing amounts of IND tax collected
 
00:37:45.170 --> 00:37:45.180 align:start position:0%
even once the uh the tax is fully
 
00:37:47.150 --> 00:37:47.160 align:start position:0%
repealed from audit and collection
 
00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:48.829 align:start position:0%
repealed from audit and collection
activity

00:37:48.829 --> 00:37:48.839 align:start position:0%
activity
 
00:37:51.530 --> 00:37:51.540 align:start position:0%
please note that there were a couple
 
00:37:53.810 --> 00:37:53.820 align:start position:0%
there are a couple outstanding items
 
00:37:55.790 --> 00:37:55.800 align:start position:0%
that we identified as technical defects
 
00:37:57.290 --> 00:37:57.300 align:start position:0%
with the bill
 
00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
um section 13 of the proposed bill would
 
00:38:02.329 --> 00:38:02.339 align:start position:0%
interfere with dra collection and audit
 
00:38:04.490 --> 00:38:04.500 align:start position:0%
activity which may occur after the
 
00:38:06.589 --> 00:38:06.599 align:start position:0%
proposed repeal based on the way it's
 
00:38:06.599 --> 00:38:07.730 align:start position:0%
proposed repeal based on the way it's
written

00:38:07.730 --> 00:38:07.740 align:start position:0%
written
 
00:38:09.650 --> 00:38:09.660 align:start position:0%
it interferes with the statute
 
00:38:13.670 --> 00:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
limitations as outlined in RSA 21j29
 
00:38:15.349 --> 00:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
we would recommend a repeal that
 
00:38:16.849 --> 00:38:16.859 align:start position:0%
accommodates the collection audit
 
00:38:18.050 --> 00:38:18.060 align:start position:0%
activity within the statute of
 
00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:19.490 align:start position:0%
activity within the statute of
limitations

00:38:19.490 --> 00:38:19.500 align:start position:0%
limitations
 
00:38:23.089 --> 00:38:23.099 align:start position:0%
and lastly section two of the proposed
 
00:38:25.910 --> 00:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
bill which addresses the increases in
 
00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:27.170 align:start position:0%
bill which addresses the increases in
exemptions

00:38:27.170 --> 00:38:27.180 align:start position:0%
exemptions
 
00:38:30.790 --> 00:38:30.800 align:start position:0%
uses the terminology tax year
 
00:38:33.829 --> 00:38:33.839 align:start position:0%
ending December 31st of each change the
 
00:38:35.150 --> 00:38:35.160 align:start position:0%
department would recommend stating
 
00:38:37.250 --> 00:38:37.260 align:start position:0%
taxable periods ending on or after
 
00:38:39.410 --> 00:38:39.420 align:start position:0%
December 31st instead of the word tax
 
00:38:40.910 --> 00:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
year for purposes of Fairly
 
00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
administering the tax
 
00:38:45.530 --> 00:38:45.540 align:start position:0%
I am available for any questions if you
 
00:38:48.410 --> 00:38:48.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:53.270 align:start position:0%
 
questions

00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:55.849 --> 00:38:55.859 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you Devin yes
 
00:38:59.030 --> 00:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
representative schanberg here
 
00:39:02.270 --> 00:39:02.280 align:start position:0%
what questions if I may Mr chair
 
00:39:04.310 --> 00:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
do you have the total number
 
00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:07.040 align:start position:0%
of taxpayers in this
 
00:39:10.609 --> 00:39:10.619 align:start position:0%
IND and secondly
 
00:39:13.490 --> 00:39:13.500 align:start position:0%
is there a statistical breakdown of
 
00:39:15.530 --> 00:39:15.540 align:start position:0%
individuals versus
 
00:39:17.569 --> 00:39:17.579 align:start position:0%
Partnerships limited reliability
 
00:39:19.790 --> 00:39:19.800 align:start position:0%
companies and associations that pay into
 
00:39:20.990 --> 00:39:21.000 align:start position:0%
the IND
 
00:39:23.390 --> 00:39:23.400 align:start position:0%
just numbers
 
00:39:26.750 --> 00:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
uh so I can answer the first part now
 
00:39:29.630 --> 00:39:29.640 align:start position:0%
um for for tax year 2019 data there were
 
00:39:33.530 --> 00:39:33.540 align:start position:0%
a total of 70 437 IMD returns filed for
 
00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:35.510 align:start position:0%
a total of 70 437 IMD returns filed for
2019.

00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
2019.
 
00:39:40.250 --> 00:39:40.260 align:start position:0%
um 37 340 of those returns claimed
 
00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:42.470 align:start position:0%
um 37 340 of those returns claimed
exemptions

00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
exemptions
 
00:39:45.470 --> 00:39:45.480 align:start position:0%
as far as the breakdown by entity if you
 
00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:51.950 --> 00:39:51.960 align:start position:0%
so in our I would like to point out one
 
00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
resource or the dra annual report
 
00:39:56.569 --> 00:39:56.579 align:start position:0%
available on our websites
 
00:39:59.030 --> 00:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
um under tax year
 
00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:01.630 align:start position:0%
um under tax year
2018

00:40:01.630 --> 00:40:01.640 align:start position:0%

Estates and Partnerships
 
00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:18.240 align:start position:0%

00:40:30.890 --> 00:40:30.900 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:33.589 align:start position:0%

00:40:52.020 --> 00:40:53.930 align:start position:0%
sorry representative Roy another
question

00:40:53.930 --> 00:40:53.940 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:40:57.470 --> 00:40:57.480 align:start position:0%
yes sir thank you for uh taking uh thank
 
00:41:00.050 --> 00:41:00.060 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman for
 
00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:00.890 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman for
um

00:41:00.890 --> 00:41:00.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:03.650 --> 00:41:03.660 align:start position:0%
recognize me and uh
 
00:41:06.290 --> 00:41:06.300 align:start position:0%
thank you representative uh silver for
 
00:41:08.270 --> 00:41:08.280 align:start position:0%
uh taking my question
 
00:41:11.870 --> 00:41:11.880 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm sorry uh Devin
 
00:41:16.370 --> 00:41:16.380 align:start position:0%
um uh maybe this is a naive question but
 
00:41:19.190 --> 00:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
is it possible is it reasonable or
 
00:41:21.410 --> 00:41:21.420 align:start position:0%
possible or should we even try to
 
00:41:24.890 --> 00:41:24.900 align:start position:0%
separate out what is an individual tax
 
00:41:28.370 --> 00:41:28.380 align:start position:0%
as opposed to the IND taxes on on
 
00:41:30.530 --> 00:41:30.540 align:start position:0%
businesses and corporations that's just
 
00:41:33.290 --> 00:41:33.300 align:start position:0%
a question and I don't know that there's
 
00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
an answer to that and I uh
 
00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:43.800 align:start position:0%
as far as uh breaking out what this bill
 
00:41:45.770 --> 00:41:45.780 align:start position:0%
does to certain entities is that what
 
00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:48.720 align:start position:0%
your question is uh let me be um Let me
 
00:41:55.370 --> 00:41:55.380 align:start position:0%
clarify would it be a in your opinion a
 
00:42:00.170 --> 00:42:00.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:02.030 --> 00:42:02.040 align:start position:0%
two it would be a different build would
 
00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
it be a better Bill to or not to have a
 
00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
bill for uh doing this for individuals
 
00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:11.640 align:start position:0%
and have a bill for doing this for uh
 
00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:13.250 align:start position:0%
and have a bill for doing this for uh
businesses

00:42:13.250 --> 00:42:13.260 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
00:42:16.069 --> 00:42:16.079 align:start position:0%
two separate instead of rolling this
 
00:42:18.290 --> 00:42:18.300 align:start position:0%
into one that's something that I would
 
00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
have to consult with our with some other
 
00:42:22.630 --> 00:42:22.640 align:start position:0%
folks in our department as far as the
 
00:42:25.609 --> 00:42:25.619 align:start position:0%
constitutionality of that goes and as
 
00:42:27.470 --> 00:42:27.480 align:start position:0%
well as the feasibility of that I'd have
 
00:42:28.849 --> 00:42:28.859 align:start position:0%
to give back to the committee on that
 
00:42:31.130 --> 00:42:31.140 align:start position:0%
but I definitely will
 
00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:32.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you for your
 
00:42:36.770 --> 00:42:36.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:36.780 --> 00:42:40.190 align:start position:0%
 
s

00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:40.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:42.589 --> 00:42:42.599 align:start position:0%
we're going to break more uh thank you
 
00:42:44.030 --> 00:42:44.040 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman members of the committee and
 
00:42:45.950 --> 00:42:45.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for working uh with me through
 
00:42:47.690 --> 00:42:47.700 align:start position:0%
my technical difficulties
 
00:42:50.329 --> 00:42:50.339 align:start position:0%
um in this new world we're living in uh
 
00:42:52.010 --> 00:42:52.020 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Greg Moore I
 
00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
am the state director with Americans for
 
00:42:56.690 --> 00:42:56.700 align:start position:0%
Prosperity here in New Hampshire and I'm
 
00:42:57.950 --> 00:42:57.960 align:start position:0%
here today to offer Americans for
 
00:42:59.569 --> 00:42:59.579 align:start position:0%
Prosperity New Hampshire's full support
 
00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
for the goal of phasing out the interest
 
00:43:03.770 --> 00:43:03.780 align:start position:0%
in dividends tax as I'm sure everyone
 
00:43:06.770 --> 00:43:06.780 align:start position:0%
knows May and New Hampshire are fond of
 
00:43:08.450 --> 00:43:08.460 align:start position:0%
saying that we don't have an income tax
 
00:43:10.329 --> 00:43:10.339 align:start position:0%
and while it's true that the state
 
00:43:13.250 --> 00:43:13.260 align:start position:0%
doesn't generally tax wages uh of course
 
00:43:15.650 --> 00:43:15.660 align:start position:0%
as this committee knows granted stated
 
00:43:17.829 --> 00:43:17.839 align:start position:0%
our tax on interest and dividends income
 
00:43:20.750 --> 00:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
moreover in recent years dra has
 
00:43:22.490 --> 00:43:22.500 align:start position:0%
indicated that the majority of IND tax
 
00:43:25.130 --> 00:43:25.140 align:start position:0%
filers are seniors many of them many of
 
00:43:26.450 --> 00:43:26.460 align:start position:0%
whom are taxing their retirement
 
00:43:28.250 --> 00:43:28.260 align:start position:0%
instruments like annuities
 
00:43:30.650 --> 00:43:30.660 align:start position:0%
unfortunately this has had the effect of
 
00:43:32.210 --> 00:43:32.220 align:start position:0%
motivating many of these seniors to
 
00:43:33.589 --> 00:43:33.599 align:start position:0%
become residents of states that don't
 
00:43:35.990 --> 00:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
tax US income like Florida I personally
 
00:43:37.370 --> 00:43:37.380 align:start position:0%
know a number of seniors who have left
 
00:43:38.930 --> 00:43:38.940 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire as a direct result of this
 
00:43:41.329 --> 00:43:41.339 align:start position:0%
tax and when they declare residency in
 
00:43:43.010 --> 00:43:43.020 align:start position:0%
another state it follows a predictable
 
00:43:45.650 --> 00:43:45.660 align:start position:0%
pattern that the mid net worth retirees
 
00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
leave entirely while a high net worth
 
00:43:49.609 --> 00:43:49.619 align:start position:0%
individuals simply spend more than half
 
00:43:51.589 --> 00:43:51.599 align:start position:0%
their year in another state and keep
 
00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
their homes here while they come from
 
00:43:55.490 --> 00:43:55.500 align:start position:0%
late spring to early fall and the
 
00:43:56.990 --> 00:43:57.000 align:start position:0%
economic impact of losing these
 
00:43:59.390 --> 00:43:59.400 align:start position:0%
individuals is substantial not only do
 
00:44:00.829 --> 00:44:00.839 align:start position:0%
they do they not spend their money here
 
00:44:02.569 --> 00:44:02.579 align:start position:0%
to grow our economy they're also not
 
00:44:04.550 --> 00:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
investing here which undermines future
 
00:44:06.349 --> 00:44:06.359 align:start position:0%
successful businesses from taking root
 
00:44:09.290 --> 00:44:09.300 align:start position:0%
it certainly wasn't lost on me when
 
00:44:10.970 --> 00:44:10.980 align:start position:0%
during the worst of pandemic for those
 
00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
States New York Governor Andrew Cuomo
 
00:44:15.829 --> 00:44:15.839 align:start position:0%
and New Jersey governor Murphy use their
 
00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
coveted press conferences to beg High
 
00:44:19.430 --> 00:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
net worth individuals not to abandon
 
00:44:20.750 --> 00:44:20.760 align:start position:0%
those States because they said the
 
00:44:22.790 --> 00:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
economic impact would be in their words
 
00:44:24.770 --> 00:44:24.780 align:start position:0%
devastating and yet here in New
 
00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have a vehicle that takes
 
00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
these folks right out of our state
 
00:44:30.589 --> 00:44:30.599 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to offer the committee a
 
00:44:32.329 --> 00:44:32.339 align:start position:0%
concrete example to drive home the point
 
00:44:35.569 --> 00:44:35.579 align:start position:0%
as a former member of the House our a
 
00:44:37.010 --> 00:44:37.020 align:start position:0%
former member of the House in fact
 
00:44:38.450 --> 00:44:38.460 align:start position:0%
someone who served with the chair and
 
00:44:39.589 --> 00:44:39.599 align:start position:0%
the vice chair in the Rock and Camp
 
00:44:41.569 --> 00:44:41.579 align:start position:0%
County delegation The Honorable Will
 
00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
Smith who made abundantly clear that he
 
00:44:44.990 --> 00:44:45.000 align:start position:0%
changed his residency from New Hampshire
 
00:44:46.970 --> 00:44:46.980 align:start position:0%
to Florida exclusively to avoid paying
 
00:44:49.609 --> 00:44:49.619 align:start position:0%
this tax now we'll still still spends
 
00:44:51.230 --> 00:44:51.240 align:start position:0%
time here at his home in Newcastle for
 
00:44:53.210 --> 00:44:53.220 align:start position:0%
about five months a year but that's down
 
00:44:54.890 --> 00:44:54.900 align:start position:0%
from the nine months he would used to
 
00:44:56.569 --> 00:44:56.579 align:start position:0%
spend here before before he moved as a
 
00:45:00.349 --> 00:45:00.359 align:start position:0%
result of the IND tax while the loss of
 
00:45:02.210 --> 00:45:02.220 align:start position:0%
additional uh lost the addition to the
 
00:45:04.130 --> 00:45:04.140 align:start position:0%
economy he would have added over those
 
00:45:06.109 --> 00:45:06.119 align:start position:0%
additional four months is real there's a
 
00:45:08.089 --> 00:45:08.099 align:start position:0%
bigger issue when will was a full-time
 
00:45:10.010 --> 00:45:10.020 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire resident he was involved
 
00:45:12.050 --> 00:45:12.060 align:start position:0%
in Angel Investing here however now that
 
00:45:13.849 --> 00:45:13.859 align:start position:0%
he's a floral resident he no longer is
 
00:45:15.530 --> 00:45:15.540 align:start position:0%
involved in that area
 
00:45:17.450 --> 00:45:17.460 align:start position:0%
so losing four months from Will has a
 
00:45:19.309 --> 00:45:19.319 align:start position:0%
magnified economic impact on our state
 
00:45:20.930 --> 00:45:20.940 align:start position:0%
and that's just one example I have
 
00:45:22.609 --> 00:45:22.619 align:start position:0%
several other individuals I know who
 
00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
have stories just like Wills I also have
 
00:45:26.870 --> 00:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
stories that over our middle middle
 
00:45:28.910 --> 00:45:28.920 align:start position:0%
class individuals who are activists of
 
00:45:30.710 --> 00:45:30.720 align:start position:0%
ours who simply packed up and left for
 
00:45:33.710 --> 00:45:33.720 align:start position:0%
good as a result of this tax what's most
 
00:45:35.870 --> 00:45:35.880 align:start position:0%
personally impactful is when they asked
 
00:45:38.150 --> 00:45:38.160 align:start position:0%
for contact information from an AFP
 
00:45:40.069 --> 00:45:40.079 align:start position:0%
chapter in States like Florida Texas or
 
00:45:41.870 --> 00:45:41.880 align:start position:0%
Arizona where they're moving so that
 
00:45:43.430 --> 00:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
they can still stay involved but they
 
00:45:45.290 --> 00:45:45.300 align:start position:0%
wish that they could have stayed here
 
00:45:47.329 --> 00:45:47.339 align:start position:0%
have you even had one of our activists
 
00:45:49.370 --> 00:45:49.380 align:start position:0%
move to Alaska over this tax which is
 
00:45:50.870 --> 00:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
hardly where I suppose I'd want to spend
 
00:45:53.450 --> 00:45:53.460 align:start position:0%
my uh retirement the point here is that
 
00:45:55.190 --> 00:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
losing these folks is not good for our
 
00:45:57.290 --> 00:45:57.300 align:start position:0%
economy period the good news is that we
 
00:45:59.210 --> 00:45:59.220 align:start position:0%
have an example of a state that phased
 
00:46:01.370 --> 00:46:01.380 align:start position:0%
out its IND tax to understand its impact
 
00:46:04.130 --> 00:46:04.140 align:start position:0%
Tennessee as of this past New Year's day
 
00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
did away with its Hall income tax which
 
00:46:08.450 --> 00:46:08.460 align:start position:0%
was its own IND tax and like us
 
00:46:10.970 --> 00:46:10.980 align:start position:0%
Tennessee also doesn't tax wages the
 
00:46:12.470 --> 00:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
beacon Center of Tennessee a policy
 
00:46:13.849 --> 00:46:13.859 align:start position:0%
Think Tank has been tracking the effect
 
00:46:15.710 --> 00:46:15.720 align:start position:0%
of the phase out of the whole income tax
 
00:46:17.990 --> 00:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
over time their research has shown that
 
00:46:19.490 --> 00:46:19.500 align:start position:0%
the estimated anticipated overall
 
00:46:21.890 --> 00:46:21.900 align:start position:0%
revenue losses from phasing out this tax
 
00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
have not materialized in the state
 
00:46:24.589 --> 00:46:24.599 align:start position:0%
stands in a stronger position
 
00:46:26.390 --> 00:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
economically as a result
 
00:46:28.670 --> 00:46:28.680 align:start position:0%
so while a static analysis of the
 
00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:30.720 align:start position:0%
reduction Revenue will seem significant
 
00:46:32.450 --> 00:46:32.460 align:start position:0%
it's also important to balance that
 
00:46:34.010 --> 00:46:34.020 align:start position:0%
against the potential economic growth
 
00:46:36.109 --> 00:46:36.119 align:start position:0%
which can also benefit State revenues
 
00:46:38.690 --> 00:46:38.700 align:start position:0%
that's why we fully support the the idea
 
00:46:40.790 --> 00:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
of the phase out of a 90 tax Not only
 
00:46:42.230 --> 00:46:42.240 align:start position:0%
would it make New Hampshire a truly
 
00:46:44.569 --> 00:46:44.579 align:start position:0%
income tax free but it would add new
 
00:46:47.030 --> 00:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
unexpected economic growth to our state
 
00:46:49.130 --> 00:46:49.140 align:start position:0%
now while we fully support the phase out
 
00:46:50.450 --> 00:46:50.460 align:start position:0%
of the IND text we would do it
 
00:46:52.849 --> 00:46:52.859 align:start position:0%
differently than the manner included in
 
00:46:55.670 --> 00:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
House Bill 568 instead of increasing
 
00:46:57.290 --> 00:46:57.300 align:start position:0%
exemptions we would suggest a matter
 
00:46:59.990 --> 00:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
similar to House Bill 529 which came to
 
00:47:01.910 --> 00:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
this Committee in 2017 sponsored by
 
00:47:04.010 --> 00:47:04.020 align:start position:0%
representative Ken Weiler that bill
 
00:47:07.130 --> 00:47:07.140 align:start position:0%
gradually reduced the int tax rate which
 
00:47:08.270 --> 00:47:08.280 align:start position:0%
we believe is a better phase out
 
00:47:10.250 --> 00:47:10.260 align:start position:0%
strategy and one that matches how
 
00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
Tennessee phased out its Hall income tax
 
00:47:14.210 --> 00:47:14.220 align:start position:0%
the reason why we prefer that route is
 
00:47:16.550 --> 00:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
because in our view the best tax reform
 
00:47:19.010 --> 00:47:19.020 align:start position:0%
strategy is to keep the base as broad as
 
00:47:21.470 --> 00:47:21.480 align:start position:0%
possible until and to reduce rates well
 
00:47:24.950 --> 00:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
the uh Hospital 568 shrinks the base and
 
00:47:27.050 --> 00:47:27.060 align:start position:0%
keeps the rates at a higher level
 
00:47:29.569 --> 00:47:29.579 align:start position:0%
moreover we are concerned about that if
 
00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:32.640 align:start position:0%
in 2025 the state legislature would have
 
00:47:34.490 --> 00:47:34.500 align:start position:0%
choose to stop the phase out then the
 
00:47:36.650 --> 00:47:36.660 align:start position:0%
reduction in the base of the tax as a
 
00:47:38.390 --> 00:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
result of the increase in the exemption
 
00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:40.200 align:start position:0%
could leave the state vulnerable to
 
00:47:42.290 --> 00:47:42.300 align:start position:0%
litigation the state no longer has a
 
00:47:44.750 --> 00:47:44.760 align:start position:0%
broadly based IND tax and puts us in a
 
00:47:46.250 --> 00:47:46.260 align:start position:0%
constitutional Jeopardy similar to the
 
00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
BPT litigation from the late 80s and
 
00:47:49.430 --> 00:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
early 90s
 
00:47:51.710 --> 00:47:51.720 align:start position:0%
it is for that reason we support the
 
00:47:53.870 --> 00:47:53.880 align:start position:0%
phase out similar to House Bill 529 from
 
00:47:56.030 --> 00:47:56.040 align:start position:0%
two legislatures ago thank you for the
 
00:47:58.069 --> 00:47:58.079 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify here today and
 
00:48:00.050 --> 00:48:00.060 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to answer any questions and
 
00:48:01.550 --> 00:48:01.560 align:start position:0%
and I have a cold it is not the
 
00:48:03.770 --> 00:48:03.780 align:start position:0%
coronavirus so thank you thank you
 
00:48:06.290 --> 00:48:06.300 align:start position:0%
members of the committee

00:48:17.690 --> 00:48:17.700 align:start position:0%
here so then we will
 
00:48:20.170 --> 00:48:20.180 align:start position:0%
go Dan McGuire
 
00:48:26.630 --> 00:48:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:29.210 --> 00:48:29.220 align:start position:0%
and also the Granite State taxpayers
 
00:48:31.670 --> 00:48:31.680 align:start position:0%
Association who's in support of the bill
 
00:48:35.089 --> 00:48:35.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:37.250 --> 00:48:37.260 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman may I be
 
00:48:40.609 --> 00:48:40.619 align:start position:0%
permitted to testify via video I did put
 
00:48:42.170 --> 00:48:42.180 align:start position:0%
my tie on this morning
 
00:48:54.290 --> 00:48:54.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:56.750 --> 00:48:56.760 align:start position:0%
Mr chair would you like me to
 
00:48:56.760 --> 00:48:59.030 align:start position:0%
Mr chair would you like me to
um

00:48:59.030 --> 00:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:17.390 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:49:17.390 --> 00:49:17.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:20.329 --> 00:49:20.339 align:start position:0%
you should be
 
00:49:25.089 --> 00:49:25.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:28.069 --> 00:49:28.079 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman and
 
00:49:29.270 --> 00:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
00:49:32.569 --> 00:49:32.579 align:start position:0%
my name is Dan McGuire and today I'm
 
00:49:34.609 --> 00:49:34.619 align:start position:0%
representing Granite State taxpayers
 
00:49:37.430 --> 00:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
I've been a member of the board for over
 
00:49:39.230 --> 00:49:39.240 align:start position:0%
10 years
 
00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:39.890 align:start position:0%
10 years
um

00:49:39.890 --> 00:49:39.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:44.329 --> 00:49:44.339 align:start position:0%
we're in support of this bill
 
00:49:47.930 --> 00:49:47.940 align:start position:0%
um reduce the interest in dividends tax
 
00:49:47.940 --> 00:49:49.370 align:start position:0%
um reduce the interest in dividends tax
no

00:49:49.370 --> 00:49:49.380 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:49:51.970 --> 00:49:51.980 align:start position:0%
hold on a second
 
00:49:51.980 --> 00:49:59.829 align:start position:0%
hold on a second
[Music]

00:49:59.829 --> 00:49:59.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:02.569 --> 00:50:02.579 align:start position:0%
my cell phone is muted but my phone is
 
00:50:02.579 --> 00:50:03.650 align:start position:0%
my cell phone is muted but my phone is
not

00:50:03.650 --> 00:50:03.660 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:50:05.870 --> 00:50:05.880 align:start position:0%
um so we're in support of this bill to
 
00:50:08.990 --> 00:50:09.000 align:start position:0%
eliminate the interest and dividends tax
 
00:50:10.970 --> 00:50:10.980 align:start position:0%
um because in our opinion and in my
 
00:50:14.030 --> 00:50:14.040 align:start position:0%
opinion this is the worst tax that we
 
00:50:18.170 --> 00:50:18.180 align:start position:0%
have the most destructive to our economy
 
00:50:21.170 --> 00:50:21.180 align:start position:0%
um of all the ones you know the BPT the
 
00:50:23.750 --> 00:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
other taxes and so on
 
00:50:25.329 --> 00:50:25.339 align:start position:0%
in general
 
00:50:29.150 --> 00:50:29.160 align:start position:0%
attacks uh discourages whatever it is
 
00:50:32.329 --> 00:50:32.339 align:start position:0%
that's being taxed the activity or the
 
00:50:35.390 --> 00:50:35.400 align:start position:0%
item or what have you and and sometimes
 
00:50:37.670 --> 00:50:37.680 align:start position:0%
that's explicit because things like
 
00:50:41.750 --> 00:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
these attacks on Tobacco we explicit in
 
00:50:45.410 --> 00:50:45.420 align:start position:0%
other syntaxes we explicitly want less
 
00:50:49.490 --> 00:50:49.500 align:start position:0%
of what a less tobacco use uh less
 
00:50:53.329 --> 00:50:53.339 align:start position:0%
liquor use Etc because they're they're
 
00:50:56.210 --> 00:50:56.220 align:start position:0%
um distracted to the public health and
 
00:50:58.430 --> 00:50:58.440 align:start position:0%
so it's it's very effective the high tax
 
00:51:00.290 --> 00:51:00.300 align:start position:0%
on cigarettes
 
00:51:02.329 --> 00:51:02.339 align:start position:0%
um causes fewer people to smoke people
 
00:51:07.309 --> 00:51:07.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:10.130 --> 00:51:10.140 align:start position:0%
which is which but this tax the interest
 
00:51:14.210 --> 00:51:14.220 align:start position:0%
in dividends tax is a tax on savings
 
00:51:17.750 --> 00:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
and savings is the most
 
00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:18.370 align:start position:0%
and savings is the most
um

00:51:18.370 --> 00:51:18.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:21.770 --> 00:51:21.780 align:start position:0%
important thing for the economy to move
 
00:51:24.829 --> 00:51:24.839 align:start position:0%
forward because savings creates Capital
 
00:51:27.109 --> 00:51:27.119 align:start position:0%
it creates businesses it creates
 
00:51:30.530 --> 00:51:30.540 align:start position:0%
machines it creates innovation
 
00:51:34.069 --> 00:51:34.079 align:start position:0%
and that is how the economy gets better
 
00:51:36.470 --> 00:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
year after year
 
00:51:38.990 --> 00:51:39.000 align:start position:0%
and and it's an improving and common
 
00:51:43.490 --> 00:51:43.500 align:start position:0%
economy which helps the citizens of New

um improves their lives
 
00:51:49.490 --> 00:51:49.500 align:start position:0%
um makes one year better than the next
 
00:51:53.390 --> 00:51:53.400 align:start position:0%
and so on why was 2020 such a horrible
 
00:51:56.950 --> 00:51:56.960 align:start position:0%
year right 2019 was a very fine year
 
00:52:00.049 --> 00:52:00.059 align:start position:0%
2020 was horrible because it wasn't as
 
00:52:02.089 --> 00:52:02.099 align:start position:0%
good as 2019.
 
00:52:04.970 --> 00:52:04.980 align:start position:0%
and so for for our
 
00:52:04.980 --> 00:52:06.410 align:start position:0%
and so for for our

00:52:16.250 --> 00:52:16.260 align:start position:0%
economy what definition
 
00:52:19.490 --> 00:52:19.500 align:start position:0%
um today is better than yesterday
 
00:52:21.109 --> 00:52:21.119 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:52:23.690 --> 00:52:23.700 align:start position:0%
um it's the interest in dividends tax or
 
00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:26.640 align:start position:0%
it's savings really which create a
 
00:52:29.809 --> 00:52:29.819 align:start position:0%
better tomorrow than today and so um
 
00:52:32.930 --> 00:52:32.940 align:start position:0%
it's it's it needs to be eliminated
 
00:52:35.990 --> 00:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
um if if there's any tax you cut this is
 
00:52:38.569 --> 00:52:38.579 align:start position:0%
the one that should be cut thank you Mr
 
00:52:42.890 --> 00:52:42.900 align:start position:0%

and represent you early
 
00:58:22.190 --> 00:58:22.200 align:start position:0%
yeah I remember yesterday I mentioned uh
 
00:58:24.589 --> 00:58:24.599 align:start position:0%
that they had some problems uh in the
 
00:58:26.930 --> 00:58:26.940 align:start position:0%
committee rooms with uh in Commerce
 
00:58:29.750 --> 00:58:29.760 align:start position:0%

um
 
00:58:33.530 --> 00:58:33.540 align:start position:0%
that's the same kind of issue they're
 
00:58:36.289 --> 00:58:36.299 align:start position:0%
having here that the table mics don't
 
00:58:38.930 --> 00:58:38.940 align:start position:0%
seem to be picking up uh as
 
00:58:42.410 --> 00:58:42.420 align:start position:0%
um efficiently as they could and also a
 
00:58:44.390 --> 00:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
little hack you don't have to upload
 
00:58:48.230 --> 00:58:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:50.210 --> 00:58:50.220 align:start position:0%
should we do a test for the table mics
 
00:58:52.190 --> 00:58:52.200 align:start position:0%
to see if we can hear us but yeah all
 
00:58:53.870 --> 00:58:53.880 align:start position:0%
you have to do is press the space bar
 
00:58:57.589 --> 00:58:57.599 align:start position:0%
and it'll unmute you temporarily let's
 
00:59:00.470 --> 00:59:00.480 align:start position:0%
try something different
 
00:59:04.250 --> 00:59:04.260 align:start position:0%
they just moved the table my closet yeah
 
00:59:05.809 --> 00:59:05.819 align:start position:0%
a little bit closer do I need to take it
 
00:59:11.890 --> 00:59:11.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:15.109 --> 00:59:15.119 align:start position:0%
how is that
 
00:59:19.789 --> 00:59:19.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:21.829 --> 00:59:21.839 align:start position:0%
representative major there is an
 
00:59:24.829 --> 00:59:24.839 align:start position:0%
attendee that's on a telephone with
 
00:59:26.569 --> 00:59:26.579 align:start position:0%
their hand up shall I give them
 
00:59:28.490 --> 00:59:28.500 align:start position:0%
permission to talk
 
00:59:28.500 --> 00:59:35.030 align:start position:0%
permission to talk
yes

00:59:35.030 --> 00:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:38.030 --> 00:59:38.040 align:start position:0%
and who is that that's what we're trying
 
00:59:39.770 --> 00:59:39.780 align:start position:0%
to figure out
 
00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:43.200 align:start position:0%
I believe it is uh Chris Christensen
 
00:59:43.200 --> 00:59:44.210 align:start position:0%
I believe it is uh Chris Christensen
um

00:59:44.210 --> 00:59:44.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:47.030 --> 00:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
but the caller needs to press star 6 to
 
00:59:54.069 --> 00:59:54.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:57.530 --> 00:59:57.540 align:start position:0%
well get these bugs worked out
 
00:59:57.540 --> 01:00:08.569 align:start position:0%
well get these bugs worked out
eventually

01:00:08.569 --> 01:00:08.579 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:11.530 --> 01:00:11.540 align:start position:0%
the name is the person on the telephone
 
01:00:14.329 --> 01:00:14.339 align:start position:0%
they've just unmuted and I believe it
 
01:00:16.609 --> 01:00:16.619 align:start position:0%
may be Chris Christensen but we'll need
 
01:00:20.870 --> 01:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:24.170 --> 01:00:24.180 align:start position:0%

01:00:52.370 --> 01:00:52.380 align:start position:0%
silber's comments about this I would
 
01:00:54.069 --> 01:00:54.079 align:start position:0%
like to add
 
01:00:54.079 --> 01:00:55.970 align:start position:0%
like to add
one

01:00:55.970 --> 01:00:55.980 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:00:59.170 --> 01:00:59.180 align:start position:0%
set of circumstances that I
 
01:01:02.870 --> 01:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
think is pretty ironic actually and that
 
01:01:04.970 --> 01:01:04.980 align:start position:0%
is that this interest in dividends tax
 
01:01:07.010 --> 01:01:07.020 align:start position:0%
started many years ago
 
01:01:09.230 --> 01:01:09.240 align:start position:0%
with an exemption
 
01:01:11.329 --> 01:01:11.339 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire savings institutions
 
01:01:14.329 --> 01:01:14.339 align:start position:0%
and Vermont uh
 
01:01:17.210 --> 01:01:17.220 align:start position:0%
and the intent was to bring more money
 
01:01:20.390 --> 01:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
into the banking system in New Hampshire
 
01:01:23.990 --> 01:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
and I think for a time it was successful
 
01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:26.760 align:start position:0%
in the 80s mag started doing National
 
01:01:30.589 --> 01:01:30.599 align:start position:0%
mergers and that exemption was seen as a
 
01:01:32.870 --> 01:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
Restraint of trade and instead of
 
01:01:35.390 --> 01:01:35.400 align:start position:0%
eliminating the tax completely it was
 
01:01:38.750 --> 01:01:38.760 align:start position:0%
extended to all interests and dividends
 
01:01:40.789 --> 01:01:40.799 align:start position:0%
seemed like a good idea at the time I
 
01:01:40.799 --> 01:01:41.809 align:start position:0%
seemed like a good idea at the time I
guess

01:01:41.809 --> 01:01:41.819 align:start position:0%
guess
 
01:01:45.589 --> 01:01:45.599 align:start position:0%
but now we've heard testimony and I have
 
01:01:48.530 --> 01:01:48.540 align:start position:0%
personal experience with friends in the
 
01:01:48.540 --> 01:01:50.750 align:start position:0%
personal experience with friends in the
state

01:01:50.750 --> 01:01:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:52.670 --> 01:01:52.680 align:start position:0%
that it is chasing people out of the
 
01:01:54.650 --> 01:01:54.660 align:start position:0%
state they're leaving and going to
 
01:01:57.589 --> 01:01:57.599 align:start position:0%
Florida or wherever it might be to avoid
 
01:02:01.370 --> 01:02:01.380 align:start position:0%
this particular tax and sometimes to
 
01:02:03.650 --> 01:02:03.660 align:start position:0%
avoid some cold weather I guess
 
01:02:05.510 --> 01:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
in the meantime
 
01:02:08.750 --> 01:02:08.760 align:start position:0%
I think we've done a good job bringing
 
01:02:10.450 --> 01:02:10.460 align:start position:0%
some money into the state
 
01:02:14.150 --> 01:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
with such things as
 
01:02:15.890 --> 01:02:15.900 align:start position:0%
tax exemptions
 
01:02:19.910 --> 01:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire trust and
 
01:02:22.069 --> 01:02:22.079 align:start position:0%
I think if we're going to be a complete
 
01:02:24.589 --> 01:02:24.599 align:start position:0%
picture that eliminating the interest in
 
01:02:27.890 --> 01:02:27.900 align:start position:0%
dividends tax would continue in that
 
01:02:30.109 --> 01:02:30.119 align:start position:0%
direction and attract more money into
 
01:02:33.770 --> 01:02:33.780 align:start position:0%
the state rather than chasing it out
 
01:02:35.930 --> 01:02:35.940 align:start position:0%
other than that I I think everything
 
01:02:38.690 --> 01:02:38.700 align:start position:0%
else has been said by others and I'm
 
01:02:41.630 --> 01:02:41.640 align:start position:0%
willing to accept any questions
 
01:02:45.710 --> 01:02:45.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:49.609 --> 01:02:49.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:53.930 --> 01:02:53.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:57.950 --> 01:02:57.960 align:start position:0%
I do not see the raised hands
 
01:03:03.170 --> 01:03:03.180 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:04.970 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:03:04.970 --> 01:03:04.980 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:03:07.309 --> 01:03:07.319 align:start position:0%
I'm going to close the public hearing on
 
01:03:42.349 --> 01:03:42.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:43.910 --> 01:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
okay I'm going to open the public
 
01:03:50.109 --> 01:03:50.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:52.309 --> 01:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
exemption under the interest and
 
01:03:55.130 --> 01:03:55.140 align:start position:0%
dividend tax and decreasing the total
 
01:03:56.809 --> 01:03:56.819 align:start position:0%
amount of research and development
 
01:04:00.109 --> 01:04:00.119 align:start position:0%

yes thank you Mr chair thank you I'm not
 
01:04:09.410 --> 01:04:09.420 align:start position:0%
sure if they can hear me with the mic
 
01:04:11.690 --> 01:04:11.700 align:start position:0%
Loops but you can take the mic over to
 
01:04:20.450 --> 01:04:20.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:20.460 --> 01:04:23.790 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

01:04:29.390 --> 01:04:29.400 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you I'm glad to be
 
01:04:31.010 --> 01:04:31.020 align:start position:0%
back in front of ways of things I just
 
01:04:32.569 --> 01:04:32.579 align:start position:0%
said here earlier it's my second most
 
01:04:34.069 --> 01:04:34.079 align:start position:0%
favorite committee because now I'm a
 
01:04:35.510 --> 01:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
chair fishing game I think that has to
 
01:04:37.910 --> 01:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
be my primary committee but thank you
 
01:04:40.190 --> 01:04:40.200 align:start position:0%
for having me back I appreciate uh being
 
01:04:41.930 --> 01:04:41.940 align:start position:0%
able to speak on this this important
 
01:04:45.950 --> 01:04:45.960 align:start position:0%
bill this bill does two basic things it
 
01:04:47.990 --> 01:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
allows New Hampshire citizens to keep
 
01:04:49.430 --> 01:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
their money
 
01:04:51.890 --> 01:04:51.900 align:start position:0%
and it requires New Hampshire businesses
 
01:04:53.930 --> 01:04:53.940 align:start position:0%
not the other Tax Services that we're
 
01:04:57.170 --> 01:04:57.180 align:start position:0%
giving them right now for tax credit
 
01:04:58.730 --> 01:04:58.740 align:start position:0%
um the second part of this bill
 
01:05:00.349 --> 01:05:00.359 align:start position:0%
basically creates a liability on first
 
01:05:02.630 --> 01:05:02.640 align:start position:0%
part of this bill in other words we're
 
01:05:04.430 --> 01:05:04.440 align:start position:0%
giving up businesses an increased tax
 
01:05:06.589 --> 01:05:06.599 align:start position:0%
credit then someone has to pay for that
 
01:05:08.930 --> 01:05:08.940 align:start position:0%
budget and that comes from people who
 
01:05:10.549 --> 01:05:10.559 align:start position:0%
pay taxes like people who paid interest
 
01:05:13.010 --> 01:05:13.020 align:start position:0%
in giving that stats what I tried to do
 
01:05:14.990 --> 01:05:15.000 align:start position:0%
here because having served two terms on
 
01:05:16.789 --> 01:05:16.799 align:start position:0%
this community one of the things I used
 
01:05:19.190 --> 01:05:19.200 align:start position:0%
to dislike which I think maybe with a a
 
01:05:21.530 --> 01:05:21.540 align:start position:0%
reduction bill is they didn't explain
 
01:05:23.150 --> 01:05:23.160 align:start position:0%
how they're going to pay for the hole in
 
01:05:25.190 --> 01:05:25.200 align:start position:0%
the budget that they were created this
 
01:05:28.430 --> 01:05:28.440 align:start position:0%
bill seeks to do that it Nets out the
 
01:05:30.710 --> 01:05:30.720 align:start position:0%
difference so the as you see from the
 
01:05:33.289 --> 01:05:33.299 align:start position:0%
fiscal note part one of this bill that
 
01:05:35.270 --> 01:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
increased the exceptions for people who
 
01:05:38.270 --> 01:05:38.280 align:start position:0%
are subject to the dividend stocks as a
 
01:05:41.089 --> 01:05:41.099 align:start position:0%
rough cost of about five million dollars
 
01:05:42.770 --> 01:05:42.780 align:start position:0%
um the second half of this bill which
 
01:05:44.530 --> 01:05:44.540 align:start position:0%
reduces the
 
01:05:46.750 --> 01:05:46.760 align:start position:0%
research and development tax credit
 
01:05:49.069 --> 01:05:49.079 align:start position:0%
reduces that by five million dollars
 
01:05:52.069 --> 01:05:52.079 align:start position:0%
getting out of zero difference in our
 
01:05:53.630 --> 01:05:53.640 align:start position:0%
income so we're not creating a budget
 
01:05:56.089 --> 01:05:56.099 align:start position:0%
deficit our budget pull uh in this bill
 
01:05:57.950 --> 01:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
of any significance
 
01:05:57.960 --> 01:05:59.089 align:start position:0%
of any significance
um

01:05:59.089 --> 01:05:59.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:01.370 --> 01:06:01.380 align:start position:0%
one thing I will I will say again having
 
01:06:03.010 --> 01:06:03.020 align:start position:0%
Services community
 
01:06:06.589 --> 01:06:06.599 align:start position:0%
and and dra both in on this on this bill
 
01:06:06.599 --> 01:06:07.970 align:start position:0%
and and dra both in on this on this bill
speaking

01:06:07.970 --> 01:06:07.980 align:start position:0%
speaking
 
01:06:07.980 --> 01:06:09.230 align:start position:0%
speaking
um

01:06:09.230 --> 01:06:09.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:11.329 --> 01:06:11.339 align:start position:0%
every time you ask for the direct
 
01:06:14.630 --> 01:06:14.640 align:start position:0%
correlation of a tax credit to
 
01:06:16.370 --> 01:06:16.380 align:start position:0%
um State benefit
 
01:06:19.130 --> 01:06:19.140 align:start position:0%
on this particular one usually what we
 
01:06:21.770 --> 01:06:21.780 align:start position:0%
hear is it's a checkbox when businesses
 
01:06:23.510 --> 01:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
are coming into the state one of the
 
01:06:25.250 --> 01:06:25.260 align:start position:0%
questions they always ask is does the
 
01:06:26.870 --> 01:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
state have a research development tax
 
01:06:29.750 --> 01:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
rate yes or no it's a checkbox on a form
 
01:06:32.270 --> 01:06:32.280 align:start position:0%
not how much it is but merely do you
 
01:06:34.490 --> 01:06:34.500 align:start position:0%
have one this bill still keeps that
 
01:06:36.470 --> 01:06:36.480 align:start position:0%
check box checked to reduce the
 
01:06:38.390 --> 01:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
different interest the research
 
01:06:40.370 --> 01:06:40.380 align:start position:0%
development tax credit from seven
 
01:06:42.410 --> 01:06:42.420 align:start position:0%
million dollars back to 2 million
 
01:06:42.420 --> 01:06:43.910 align:start position:0%
million dollars back to 2 million
dollars

01:06:43.910 --> 01:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:06:46.609 --> 01:06:46.619 align:start position:0%
this was originally when the research
 
01:06:48.349 --> 01:06:48.359 align:start position:0%
development tax credit was implemented
 
01:06:51.410 --> 01:06:51.420 align:start position:0%
by staff by law by a bill it was
 
01:06:53.690 --> 01:06:53.700 align:start position:0%
implemented at two million dollars
 
01:06:56.510 --> 01:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
through a budget negotiation
 
01:06:59.329 --> 01:06:59.339 align:start position:0%
into one of the house bill twos all of a
 
01:07:00.770 --> 01:07:00.780 align:start position:0%
sudden five million dollars appeared on
 
01:07:02.450 --> 01:07:02.460 align:start position:0%
Research development tax credit and the
 
01:07:04.910 --> 01:07:04.920 align:start position:0%
cow was increased instead
 
01:07:07.430 --> 01:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
which is not the proper way of doing
 
01:07:09.650 --> 01:07:09.660 align:start position:0%
budgeting and billing and shipping them
 
01:07:11.690 --> 01:07:11.700 align:start position:0%
back someone wants to bring it back up
 
01:07:15.410 --> 01:07:15.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:17.089 --> 01:07:17.099 align:start position:0%
in the profitability and not through a
 
01:07:18.710 --> 01:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
budget deal that was made in House Bill
 
01:07:22.609 --> 01:07:22.619 align:start position:0%
too so if this bill also seeks to fix
 
01:07:25.010 --> 01:07:25.020 align:start position:0%
the contestants that was done and ran
 
01:07:26.870 --> 01:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
for that business subsidy in a tax
 
01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:27.950 align:start position:0%
for that business subsidy in a tax
credit

01:07:27.950 --> 01:07:27.960 align:start position:0%
credit
 
01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:29.710 align:start position:0%
credit
um

01:07:29.710 --> 01:07:29.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:32.089 --> 01:07:32.099 align:start position:0%

01:08:27.410 --> 01:08:27.420 align:start position:0%
um what you're proposing on the face of
 
01:08:29.689 --> 01:08:29.699 align:start position:0%
it seems to make sense I guess my
 
01:08:31.249 --> 01:08:31.259 align:start position:0%
question would be based on the testimony
 
01:08:32.769 --> 01:08:32.779 align:start position:0%
we heard on the previous Bill
 
01:08:34.849 --> 01:08:34.859 align:start position:0%
eliminating the interest in dividends
 
01:08:34.859 --> 01:08:36.169 align:start position:0%
eliminating the interest in dividends
tax

01:08:36.169 --> 01:08:36.179 align:start position:0%
tax
 
01:08:36.179 --> 01:08:36.890 align:start position:0%
tax
um

01:08:36.890 --> 01:08:36.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:39.349 --> 01:08:39.359 align:start position:0%
but many of those arguments were that
 
01:08:41.209 --> 01:08:41.219 align:start position:0%
we're losing a lot of
 
01:08:41.219 --> 01:08:41.930 align:start position:0%
we're losing a lot of
um

01:08:41.930 --> 01:08:41.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:44.990 --> 01:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
High income investors or high you know
 
01:08:48.110 --> 01:08:48.120 align:start position:0%
people who are benefiting from they're
 
01:08:50.930 --> 01:08:50.940 align:start position:0%
moving to Florida to avoid the tax so if
 
01:08:54.229 --> 01:08:54.239 align:start position:0%
if you go from a 2400 exemption to a 3
 
01:08:57.590 --> 01:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
500 exemption is that really going to
 
01:08:57.600 --> 01:08:59.030 align:start position:0%
500 exemption is that really going to
stop

01:08:59.030 --> 01:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
stop
 
01:09:01.430 --> 01:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
um you know what we heard previously
 
01:09:03.950 --> 01:09:03.960 align:start position:0%
were a lot of these uh people are
 
01:09:06.709 --> 01:09:06.719 align:start position:0%
moving to Florida and other states
 
01:09:11.450 --> 01:09:11.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:13.430 --> 01:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
for investors right we're increasing
 
01:09:15.650 --> 01:09:15.660 align:start position:0%
that exemption and the threshold before
 
01:09:18.110 --> 01:09:18.120 align:start position:0%
you have to pay this tax and so the
 
01:09:19.970 --> 01:09:19.980 align:start position:0%
smaller investors would become now no
 
01:09:21.709 --> 01:09:21.719 align:start position:0%
longer subject to the Caps you know to
 
01:09:23.809 --> 01:09:23.819 align:start position:0%
keep their money larger investors are
 
01:09:27.970 --> 01:09:27.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:30.990 --> 01:09:31.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.789 align:start position:0%
thank you

01:09:33.789 --> 01:09:33.799 align:start position:0%

01:09:38.090 --> 01:09:38.100 align:start position:0%
so if you do the next testifying would
 
01:09:38.100 --> 01:09:39.650 align:start position:0%
so if you do the next testifying would
be

01:09:39.650 --> 01:09:39.660 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:09:42.289 --> 01:09:42.299 align:start position:0%

01:09:50.689 --> 01:09:50.699 align:start position:0%
would you like that
 
01:09:56.510 --> 01:09:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:59.030 --> 01:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
I do not see
 
01:10:01.610 --> 01:10:01.620 align:start position:0%
oh Julie Demers but it looks like the
 
01:10:03.709 --> 01:10:03.719 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Tech Alliance which is
 
01:10:03.719 --> 01:10:04.250 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Tech Alliance which is
um

01:10:04.250 --> 01:10:04.260 align:start position:0%

Mr mers's
um

01:10:07.370 --> 01:10:07.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:10.370 --> 01:10:10.380 align:start position:0%
organization has raised their hand
 
01:10:10.380 --> 01:10:11.870 align:start position:0%
organization has raised their hand
um

01:10:11.870 --> 01:10:11.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:14.570 --> 01:10:14.580 align:start position:0%
I've just allowed them to talk please
 
01:10:16.669 --> 01:10:16.679 align:start position:0%
um unmute yourself
 
01:10:18.770 --> 01:10:18.780 align:start position:0%
hi thank you so much um can everyone
 
01:10:20.750 --> 01:10:20.760 align:start position:0%

01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:21.950 align:start position:0%
hear me okay
yes

01:10:21.950 --> 01:10:21.960 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:10:23.810 --> 01:10:23.820 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you all for your
 
01:10:24.830 --> 01:10:24.840 align:start position:0%
time today
 
01:10:26.689 --> 01:10:26.699 align:start position:0%
um so as it was noted my name is Julie
 
01:10:28.910 --> 01:10:28.920 align:start position:0%
Demars and I'm here on behalf of the New
 
01:10:30.890 --> 01:10:30.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Tech Alliance
 
01:10:32.330 --> 01:10:32.340 align:start position:0%
um the tech Alliance is the largest
 
01:10:34.669 --> 01:10:34.679 align:start position:0%
member driven technology Association in
 
01:10:37.370 --> 01:10:37.380 align:start position:0%
the state we support research Innovation
 
01:10:39.290 --> 01:10:39.300 align:start position:0%
economic and Workforce Development
 
01:10:40.729 --> 01:10:40.739 align:start position:0%
efforts that have helped New Hampshire
 
01:10:42.729 --> 01:10:42.739 align:start position:0%
become a national leader in
 
01:10:45.050 --> 01:10:45.060 align:start position:0%
technology-based industrial and
 
01:10:47.110 --> 01:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
development and entrepreneurism
 
01:10:50.209 --> 01:10:50.219 align:start position:0%
our organization Works to promote and
 
01:10:52.189 --> 01:10:52.199 align:start position:0%
grow our Tech sector by reducing
 
01:10:54.050 --> 01:10:54.060 align:start position:0%
barriers to growth and finding better
 
01:10:56.390 --> 01:10:56.400 align:start position:0%
ways to access capital and the human
 
01:10:58.550 --> 01:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
resources needed to support the New
 
01:11:01.310 --> 01:11:01.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire economy in years like this and
 
01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:02.510 align:start position:0%
Hampshire economy in years like this and
Beyond

01:11:02.510 --> 01:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
Beyond
 
01:11:05.209 --> 01:11:05.219 align:start position:0%
so our government Affairs efforts which
 
01:11:06.890 --> 01:11:06.900 align:start position:0%
is a comprehensive team representative
 
01:11:09.590 --> 01:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
of our membership focus on ensuring that
 
01:11:11.570 --> 01:11:11.580 align:start position:0%
the regulatory structure is as business
 
01:11:13.550 --> 01:11:13.560 align:start position:0%
friendly as possible and that growth
 
01:11:15.290 --> 01:11:15.300 align:start position:0%
incentives are in place to serve our
 
01:11:17.750 --> 01:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
members therefore today we're standing
 
01:11:20.390 --> 01:11:20.400 align:start position:0%
in opposition to this bill we recognize
 
01:11:22.790 --> 01:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
that a healthy r d tax credit is a
 
01:11:25.010 --> 01:11:25.020 align:start position:0%
critical component of a larger effort to
 
01:11:27.050 --> 01:11:27.060 align:start position:0%
better the business climate for New
 
01:11:29.330 --> 01:11:29.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire high-tech companies and it is
 
01:11:31.370 --> 01:11:31.380 align:start position:0%
a key component in attracting high-tech
 
01:11:33.590 --> 01:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
businesses I would argue that it's not
 
01:11:35.169 --> 01:11:35.179 align:start position:0%
just a box to check
 
01:11:38.450 --> 01:11:38.460 align:start position:0%
a cut to the existing credit Will impede
 
01:11:40.250 --> 01:11:40.260 align:start position:0%
our ability to continue to grow the tech
 
01:11:43.070 --> 01:11:43.080 align:start position:0%
sector in New Hampshire so Tech stands
 
01:11:45.470 --> 01:11:45.480 align:start position:0%
alongside Advanced manufacturing as one
 
01:11:47.570 --> 01:11:47.580 align:start position:0%
of the leading drivers of our economy so
 
01:11:49.790 --> 01:11:49.800 align:start position:0%
the technology sector alone contributed
 
01:11:53.750 --> 01:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
10.9 billion or 13.7 percent of the
 
01:11:55.130 --> 01:11:55.140 align:start position:0%
state's GDP
 
01:11:58.729 --> 01:11:58.739 align:start position:0%
um in 2019 and jobs in this sector pay
 
01:12:00.890 --> 01:12:00.900 align:start position:0%
higher wages and Export products from
 
01:12:02.830 --> 01:12:02.840 align:start position:0%
the state to other areas
 
01:12:05.810 --> 01:12:05.820 align:start position:0%
in the world so this is effectively
 
01:12:07.970 --> 01:12:07.980 align:start position:0%
transferring outside money into the
 
01:12:10.790 --> 01:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
state's economy these sectors provide
 
01:12:12.470 --> 01:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
Healthy Living wages to New Hampshire
 
01:12:14.630 --> 01:12:14.640 align:start position:0%
individuals and their families
 
01:12:16.250 --> 01:12:16.260 align:start position:0%
so you're looking at technology
 
01:12:17.870 --> 01:12:17.880 align:start position:0%
companies whose media and Tech
 
01:12:20.870 --> 01:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
occupation wages continue to increase
 
01:12:23.689 --> 01:12:23.699 align:start position:0%
and they're 85 percent higher than New
 
01:12:26.209 --> 01:12:26.219 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's median State wages so that's
 
01:12:28.669 --> 01:12:28.679 align:start position:0%
continuing to grow that's up from 80 in
 
01:12:32.030 --> 01:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
2018. so I understand the argument that
 
01:12:34.189 --> 01:12:34.199 align:start position:0%
we want New Hampshire citizens to keep
 
01:12:35.870 --> 01:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
their money but this is at the expense
 
01:12:38.390 --> 01:12:38.400 align:start position:0%
of the com companies that are bringing
 
01:12:40.370 --> 01:12:40.380 align:start position:0%
these really high paying jobs with
 
01:12:42.950 --> 01:12:42.960 align:start position:0%
healthy wages and although New Hampshire
 
01:12:44.930 --> 01:12:44.940 align:start position:0%
arguably does have a very high quality
 
01:12:46.970 --> 01:12:46.980 align:start position:0%
of life it also has one of the highest
 
01:12:49.970 --> 01:12:49.980 align:start position:0%
tax business tax rates in the nation our
 
01:12:52.370 --> 01:12:52.380 align:start position:0%
current r d tax credit program supports
 
01:12:54.290 --> 01:12:54.300 align:start position:0%
the growth in the tech sector it allows
 
01:12:56.090 --> 01:12:56.100 align:start position:0%
us to remain competitive in the global
 
01:12:59.510 --> 01:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
marketplace with um especially in this
 
01:13:01.729 --> 01:13:01.739 align:start position:0%
environment with remote workforces being
 
01:13:03.709 --> 01:13:03.719 align:start position:0%
increasingly more accepted we're
 
01:13:06.709 --> 01:13:06.719 align:start position:0%
Fielding calls every week of technology
 
01:13:08.750 --> 01:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
companies that are looking to move here
 
01:13:10.130 --> 01:13:10.140 align:start position:0%
and they have an interest in New
 
01:13:13.189 --> 01:13:13.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm just asking that we do not
 
01:13:15.590 --> 01:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
give these companies a reason in to look
 
01:13:16.910 --> 01:13:16.920 align:start position:0%
to other states that have more
 
01:13:19.250 --> 01:13:19.260 align:start position:0%
attractive r d tax credits lower energy
 
01:13:22.070 --> 01:13:22.080 align:start position:0%
costs more favorable environmental and
 
01:13:24.290 --> 01:13:24.300 align:start position:0%
labor regulations and and lower business
 
01:13:26.750 --> 01:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
taxes I'm going to reiterate again that
 
01:13:28.430 --> 01:13:28.440 align:start position:0%
it was mentioned that this is just a box
 
01:13:30.709 --> 01:13:30.719 align:start position:0%
to check it's really not these companies
 
01:13:32.930 --> 01:13:32.940 align:start position:0%
are comparing Apples to Apples and it
 
01:13:34.610 --> 01:13:34.620 align:start position:0%
could be the make or break between a
 
01:13:37.310 --> 01:13:37.320 align:start position:0%
company coming here bringing high-paying
 
01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:38.570 align:start position:0%
company coming here bringing high-paying
jobs

01:13:38.570 --> 01:13:38.580 align:start position:0%
jobs
 
01:13:42.470 --> 01:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
um or going elsewhere so in 2018 I think
 
01:13:43.850 --> 01:13:43.860 align:start position:0%
there was an interest in understanding
 
01:13:46.490 --> 01:13:46.500 align:start position:0%
the impact of this and I'm sure you have
 
01:13:49.250 --> 01:13:49.260 align:start position:0%
this information but in 2018 the first
 
01:13:50.870 --> 01:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
year that that tax credit was available
 
01:13:53.930 --> 01:13:53.940 align:start position:0%
you had 71 companies reporting more than
 
01:13:56.630 --> 01:13:56.640 align:start position:0%
112 million of qualified research and
 
01:13:58.850 --> 01:13:58.860 align:start position:0%
development related wages that it
 
01:14:01.610 --> 01:14:01.620 align:start position:0%
engaged and applied for that credit in
 
01:14:04.490 --> 01:14:04.500 align:start position:0%
2020 that that increased to 230
 
01:14:06.709 --> 01:14:06.719 align:start position:0%
companies so companies are taking
 
01:14:09.110 --> 01:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
advantage of this so our membership
 
01:14:11.090 --> 01:14:11.100 align:start position:0%
specifically which ranges from small
 
01:14:13.250 --> 01:14:13.260 align:start position:0%
startups to large companies that conduct
 
01:14:16.610 --> 01:14:16.620 align:start position:0%
Commerce both nationally and globally
 
01:14:19.010 --> 01:14:19.020 align:start position:0%
um benefits from a healthy r d tax
 
01:14:22.070 --> 01:14:22.080 align:start position:0%
credit program so ultimately we feel
 
01:14:24.770 --> 01:14:24.780 align:start position:0%
that a change to the existing
 
01:14:27.050 --> 01:14:27.060 align:start position:0%
um r d tax credit would be a huge step
 
01:14:29.689 --> 01:14:29.699 align:start position:0%
backwards for our membership the the
 
01:14:31.970 --> 01:14:31.980 align:start position:0%
sector and the state overall when you're
 
01:14:33.890 --> 01:14:33.900 align:start position:0%
looking at the companies that are
 
01:14:35.570 --> 01:14:35.580 align:start position:0%
looking to grow here and what we want
 
01:14:37.250 --> 01:14:37.260 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to be
 
01:14:39.229 --> 01:14:39.239 align:start position:0%
about four or five years down the road
 
01:14:42.290 --> 01:14:42.300 align:start position:0%
so thank you I I appreciate the time
 
01:14:45.590 --> 01:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
today and I'd be open to any questions
 
01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:46.890 align:start position:0%
here we have a question
 
01:14:46.890 --> 01:14:54.310 align:start position:0%
here we have a question
[Music]

01:14:54.310 --> 01:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:59.090 --> 01:14:59.100 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chairman uh Mr
 
01:15:03.410 --> 01:15:03.420 align:start position:0%
Merz on I was the uh chair at the time
 
01:15:07.669 --> 01:15:07.679 align:start position:0%
that we set up the r d on tax credit it
 
01:15:09.189 --> 01:15:09.199 align:start position:0%
is from
 
01:15:13.130 --> 01:15:13.140 align:start position:0%
2009 I believe maybe eight eight
 
01:15:15.530 --> 01:15:15.540 align:start position:0%
on and
 
01:15:19.669 --> 01:15:19.679 align:start position:0%
at that time it was meant as a million
 
01:15:24.950 --> 01:15:24.960 align:start position:0%
on and it got raised to 2 million and
 
01:15:26.990 --> 01:15:27.000 align:start position:0%
then all of a sudden to 7 million
 
01:15:31.010 --> 01:15:31.020 align:start position:0%
because uh so many more companies wanted
 
01:15:35.330 --> 01:15:35.340 align:start position:0%
to use it but everybody that uh uses
 
01:15:37.910 --> 01:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
this Credit First has to take the
 
01:15:40.310 --> 01:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
Federal Credit and we have never been
 
01:15:43.310 --> 01:15:43.320 align:start position:0%
given information that would allow us to
 
01:15:46.430 --> 01:15:46.440 align:start position:0%
understand what percentage of the
 
01:15:48.890 --> 01:15:48.900 align:start position:0%
federal tax credit is what they are
 
01:15:50.810 --> 01:15:50.820 align:start position:0%
getting from the state one since the
 
01:15:53.149 --> 01:15:53.159 align:start position:0%
state really can't afford very much
 
01:15:55.490 --> 01:15:55.500 align:start position:0%
money for things like this and it goes
 
01:15:58.130 --> 01:15:58.140 align:start position:0%
on your local property tax if we cut our
 
01:16:00.830 --> 01:16:00.840 align:start position:0%
taxes at the state level too much
 
01:16:04.189 --> 01:16:04.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:07.430 --> 01:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
thank you you have information on this
 
01:16:09.950 --> 01:16:09.960 align:start position:0%
on when someone gets the federal tax
 
01:16:11.810 --> 01:16:11.820 align:start position:0%
credit and then they turn around and get
 
01:16:14.390 --> 01:16:14.400 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire tax credit what what
 
01:16:18.709 --> 01:16:18.719 align:start position:0%
is the ratio in terms of money acquired
 
01:16:21.169 --> 01:16:21.179 align:start position:0%
I do not have that information but I
 
01:16:23.510 --> 01:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
just made a note um to have that be a
 
01:16:25.490 --> 01:16:25.500 align:start position:0%
talking point and have our government
 
01:16:27.410 --> 01:16:27.420 align:start position:0%
Affairs committee and also our executive
 
01:16:29.689 --> 01:16:29.699 align:start position:0%
committee look into seeing if this can
 
01:16:31.370 --> 01:16:31.380 align:start position:0%
be information that we could actively
 
01:16:34.310 --> 01:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
gather for future reference
 
01:16:36.169 --> 01:16:36.179 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:16:36.179 --> 01:16:38.149 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

01:16:38.149 --> 01:16:38.159 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:16:39.950 --> 01:16:39.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you Mr
 
01:16:42.770 --> 01:16:42.780 align:start position:0%
nurse for testifying with us today uh in
 
01:16:46.250 --> 01:16:46.260 align:start position:0%
your testimony you uh you alluded to a
 
01:16:48.850 --> 01:16:48.860 align:start position:0%
statistics statistics from other states
 
01:16:51.950 --> 01:16:51.960 align:start position:0%
uh on this r d do you have any
 
01:16:53.870 --> 01:16:53.880 align:start position:0%
information on those other states that
 
01:16:55.130 --> 01:16:55.140 align:start position:0%
you were talking about so that we can
 
01:16:58.490 --> 01:16:58.500 align:start position:0%
have a comparison to their their rights
 
01:17:00.830 --> 01:17:00.840 align:start position:0%
as a comparison to ours
 
01:17:03.169 --> 01:17:03.179 align:start position:0%
I have it anecdotally but if that would
 
01:17:04.790 --> 01:17:04.800 align:start position:0%
be helpful for you to see I think that
 
01:17:05.990 --> 01:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
could be something we could pull
 
01:17:08.750 --> 01:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
together thank you
 
01:17:11.510 --> 01:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
01:17:13.310 --> 01:17:13.320 align:start position:0%
and none
 
01:17:15.649 --> 01:17:15.659 align:start position:0%
we will go to
 
01:17:17.990 --> 01:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
Dan McGuire
 
01:17:33.890 --> 01:17:33.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:44.990 --> 01:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:47.870 --> 01:17:47.880 align:start position:0%
okay then why
 
01:17:49.729 --> 01:17:49.739 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman and
 
01:17:50.810 --> 01:17:50.820 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
01:17:52.970 --> 01:17:52.980 align:start position:0%
my name is Dan McGuire I'm from Epsom
 
01:17:55.310 --> 01:17:55.320 align:start position:0%
and I'm a member of the board of Granite
 
01:17:57.410 --> 01:17:57.420 align:start position:0%
State taxpayers
 
01:17:57.420 --> 01:17:58.130 align:start position:0%
State taxpayers
um

01:17:58.130 --> 01:17:58.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:00.950 --> 01:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
I'm previously on the on the previous
 
01:18:04.490 --> 01:18:04.500 align:start position:0%
Bill uh testified why we think the
 
01:18:06.709 --> 01:18:06.719 align:start position:0%
um interest in dividends tax should be
 
01:18:09.350 --> 01:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
reduced if and eliminate ideally
 
01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:11.270 align:start position:0%
reduced if and eliminate ideally
eliminated

01:18:11.270 --> 01:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
eliminated
 
01:18:14.510 --> 01:18:14.520 align:start position:0%
um but I also am in favor or we are also
 
01:18:16.550 --> 01:18:16.560 align:start position:0%
in favor of the other half of this bill
 
01:18:19.189 --> 01:18:19.199 align:start position:0%
which is reducing or eliminating
 
01:18:22.130 --> 01:18:22.140 align:start position:0%
research and development tax credit
 
01:18:25.310 --> 01:18:25.320 align:start position:0%
now I personally am an angel investor
 
01:18:27.709 --> 01:18:27.719 align:start position:0%
and frequently invest in Tech startups
 
01:18:29.750 --> 01:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
and so you might think that I've gone in
 
01:18:31.189 --> 01:18:31.199 align:start position:0%
favor of the research and development
 
01:18:35.630 --> 01:18:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:38.030 --> 01:18:38.040 align:start position:0%
I've heard in any meeting where we
 
01:18:38.040 --> 01:18:39.470 align:start position:0%
I've heard in any meeting where we
consider

01:18:39.470 --> 01:18:39.480 align:start position:0%
consider
 
01:18:42.229 --> 01:18:42.239 align:start position:0%
um investing in a in a tech company that
 
01:18:45.890 --> 01:18:45.900 align:start position:0%
this is any kind of issue
 
01:18:48.470 --> 01:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
um or that any kind of a benefit or
 
01:18:53.410 --> 01:18:53.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:56.570 --> 01:18:56.580 align:start position:0%
is exactly correct and let me expand her
 
01:18:56.580 --> 01:18:57.350 align:start position:0%
is exactly correct and let me expand her
point

01:18:57.350 --> 01:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
point
 
01:19:00.050 --> 01:19:00.060 align:start position:0%
if you go into this bill and look at the
 
01:19:01.669 --> 01:19:01.679 align:start position:0%
RSA that has the research and
 
01:19:04.970 --> 01:19:04.980 align:start position:0%
development tax credit it refers to a
 
01:19:08.689 --> 01:19:08.699 align:start position:0%
section of the U.S tax code and if you
 
01:19:12.290 --> 01:19:12.300 align:start position:0%
go search for that and and read who is
 
01:19:13.610 --> 01:19:13.620 align:start position:0%
actually getting the credit the
 
01:19:15.950 --> 01:19:15.960 align:start position:0%
definition of this credit because we
 
01:19:18.709 --> 01:19:18.719 align:start position:0%
just give some fraction of the Federal
 
01:19:21.410 --> 01:19:21.420 align:start position:0%
Credit to to New Hampshire companies so
 
01:19:23.990 --> 01:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
we we're adding on to the Federal Credit
 
01:19:26.450 --> 01:19:26.460 align:start position:0%
you will find that this is not a simple
 
01:19:30.470 --> 01:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
you know you did so much research last
 
01:19:32.090 --> 01:19:32.100 align:start position:0%
year so we're going to give you a
 
01:19:34.490 --> 01:19:34.500 align:start position:0%
fraction of it back
 
01:19:37.070 --> 01:19:37.080 align:start position:0%
um this is not based on just last year's
 
01:19:37.080 --> 01:19:40.209 align:start position:0%
um this is not based on just last year's
activity

01:19:40.209 --> 01:19:40.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:45.290 --> 01:19:45.300 align:start position:0%
definition of the research Credit in
 
01:19:48.350 --> 01:19:48.360 align:start position:0%
um in federal tax law is based on uh
 
01:19:50.390 --> 01:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
it's a very complicated formula but it
 
01:19:52.850 --> 01:19:52.860 align:start position:0%
has to do with you know what did you do
 
01:19:56.330 --> 01:19:56.340 align:start position:0%
since 1981 how much research have you
 
01:19:59.510 --> 01:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
done in the past Etc so so in my opinion
 
01:20:02.290 --> 01:20:02.300 align:start position:0%
what's what it really does is benefit
 
01:20:07.189 --> 01:20:07.199 align:start position:0%
companies that were small uh at in you
 
01:20:09.770 --> 01:20:09.780 align:start position:0%
know 20 30 years ago such as Microsoft
 
01:20:12.890 --> 01:20:12.900 align:start position:0%
Apple Intel Etc they're the ones getting
 
01:20:16.370 --> 01:20:16.380 align:start position:0%
the bulk of this of this credit
 
01:20:19.189 --> 01:20:19.199 align:start position:0%
um it's not about how much research did
 
01:20:21.169 --> 01:20:21.179 align:start position:0%
you do last year and therefore if you're
 
01:20:22.490 --> 01:20:22.500 align:start position:0%
increasing it you're going to get a
 
01:20:24.890 --> 01:20:24.900 align:start position:0%
better you know pay less tax this year
 
01:20:30.910 --> 01:20:30.920 align:start position:0%
so so my point is it's not good to
 
01:20:34.070 --> 01:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
distort the tax code in this way and and
 
01:20:37.430 --> 01:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
say that somehow a high-tech company is
 
01:20:38.990 --> 01:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
better than some other kind of company
 
01:20:44.270 --> 01:20:44.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:47.209 --> 01:20:47.219 align:start position:0%
it's code that's that's favoring
 
01:20:49.970 --> 01:20:49.980 align:start position:0%
specific large companies
 
01:20:52.790 --> 01:20:52.800 align:start position:0%
um as opposed to to other companies in
 
01:20:55.130 --> 01:20:55.140 align:start position:0%
the same business so
 
01:20:55.140 --> 01:20:55.790 align:start position:0%
the same business so
um

01:20:55.790 --> 01:20:55.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:59.270 --> 01:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
we are in very much in favor of as I
 
01:21:02.149 --> 01:21:02.159 align:start position:0%
said reducing or eliminating uh this
 
01:21:05.149 --> 01:21:05.159 align:start position:0%
particular tax credit it is not a it's
 
01:21:07.310 --> 01:21:07.320 align:start position:0%
not what you think it is just based on
 
01:21:09.770 --> 01:21:09.780 align:start position:0%
the name of it thank you very much Mr
 
01:21:09.780 --> 01:21:11.450 align:start position:0%
the name of it thank you very much Mr
chairman

01:21:11.450 --> 01:21:11.460 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:21:11.460 --> 01:21:12.470 align:start position:0%
chairman
questions

01:21:12.470 --> 01:21:12.480 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:21:12.480 --> 01:21:12.680 align:start position:0%
questions
um

01:21:12.680 --> 01:21:12.690 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:12.690 --> 01:21:19.990 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

01:21:19.990 --> 01:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:21:22.970 --> 01:21:22.980 align:start position:0%
uh this is more of a question for the
 
01:21:27.110 --> 01:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
chair uh because of um The Honorable uh
 
01:21:31.070 --> 01:21:31.080 align:start position:0%
Mr McGuire uh his testimony kind of cut
 
01:21:32.390 --> 01:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
out a little bit is there going to be a
 
01:21:35.750 --> 01:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
written testimony submitted from him
 
01:21:38.090 --> 01:21:38.100 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to do that
 
01:21:40.370 --> 01:21:40.380 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr Barr we you just cut out
 
01:21:41.689 --> 01:21:41.699 align:start position:0%
just a little bit and I think that there
 
01:21:43.490 --> 01:21:43.500 align:start position:0%
may have been some important pieces that
 
01:21:45.050 --> 01:21:45.060 align:start position:0%
we might have missed
 
01:21:49.189 --> 01:21:49.199 align:start position:0%
no problem my home internet is not the
 
01:21:49.199 --> 01:21:50.510 align:start position:0%
no problem my home internet is not the
best

01:21:50.510 --> 01:21:50.520 align:start position:0%
best
 
01:21:54.950 --> 01:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:01.570 --> 01:22:01.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:06.169 --> 01:22:06.179 align:start position:0%
I do see one representative oh
 
01:22:16.510 --> 01:22:16.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:19.310 --> 01:22:19.320 align:start position:0%
I guess it went away this is John
 
01:22:21.470 --> 01:22:21.480 align:start position:0%
representative jinigian
 
01:22:24.890 --> 01:22:24.900 align:start position:0%
um I have a question for Mr McGuire
 
01:22:27.530 --> 01:22:27.540 align:start position:0%
um I guess in considering your I'm
 
01:22:29.510 --> 01:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
someone who spent 25 years in high tech
 
01:22:32.270 --> 01:22:32.280 align:start position:0%
uh not necessarily as an investor more
 
01:22:35.030 --> 01:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
as a participant but as you're looking
 
01:22:36.890 --> 01:22:36.900 align:start position:0%
at companies
 
01:22:39.649 --> 01:22:39.659 align:start position:0%
it seems to me counterintuitive that I
 
01:22:40.850 --> 01:22:40.860 align:start position:0%
mean I can see where there's certain
 
01:22:44.209 --> 01:22:44.219 align:start position:0%
companies of certain sizes that uh you
 
01:22:45.470 --> 01:22:45.480 align:start position:0%
know if you're a one or two person
 
01:22:47.750 --> 01:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
startup the seven million exemption
 
01:22:50.330 --> 01:22:50.340 align:start position:0%
isn't going to help you that much but if
 
01:22:53.709 --> 01:22:53.719 align:start position:0%
you are large enough
 
01:22:55.850 --> 01:22:55.860 align:start position:0%
that you know I don't know what that
 
01:22:58.010 --> 01:22:58.020 align:start position:0%
number would be 10 15 employees 20
 
01:22:58.020 --> 01:22:59.870 align:start position:0%
number would be 10 15 employees 20
employees

01:22:59.870 --> 01:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
employees
 
01:23:02.030 --> 01:23:02.040 align:start position:0%
um 30 employees wear that 7 million
 
01:23:03.830 --> 01:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
makes a huge difference in your r d
 
01:23:03.840 --> 01:23:05.390 align:start position:0%
makes a huge difference in your r d
budget

01:23:05.390 --> 01:23:05.400 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:23:07.430 --> 01:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
um I guess my concern would be are we
 
01:23:09.770 --> 01:23:09.780 align:start position:0%
losing chances for Innovation because
 
01:23:13.010 --> 01:23:13.020 align:start position:0%
while you're saying large companies
 
01:23:15.169 --> 01:23:15.179 align:start position:0%
um you know it's just a benefit for them
 
01:23:18.050 --> 01:23:18.060 align:start position:0%
these mid-size small to mid-sized
 
01:23:19.850 --> 01:23:19.860 align:start position:0%
companies are we possibly losing
 
01:23:21.850 --> 01:23:21.860 align:start position:0%
opportunities for future Innovation
 
01:23:25.669 --> 01:23:25.679 align:start position:0%
which could lead to economic growth
 
01:23:27.350 --> 01:23:27.360 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for the question
 
01:23:31.130 --> 01:23:31.140 align:start position:0%
representative I think you'll find that
 
01:23:33.110 --> 01:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
well seven million sounds like a
 
01:23:35.330 --> 01:23:35.340 align:start position:0%
significant number
 
01:23:38.390 --> 01:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
um this is being spread over I don't
 
01:23:40.189 --> 01:23:40.199 align:start position:0%
know 50 to 100 companies you could ask
 
01:23:43.310 --> 01:23:43.320 align:start position:0%
the dra specifically how many companies
 
01:23:46.130 --> 01:23:46.140 align:start position:0%
um take advantage of this but now you're
 
01:23:48.350 --> 01:23:48.360 align:start position:0%
talking about if it were a hundred
 
01:23:50.750 --> 01:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
companies at seventy thousand dollars
 
01:23:54.649 --> 01:23:54.659 align:start position:0%
per company and seventy thousand dollars
 
01:23:57.590 --> 01:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
um for a company like Microsoft is a
 
01:23:59.870 --> 01:23:59.880 align:start position:0%
nothing right so
 
01:24:03.890 --> 01:24:03.900 align:start position:0%
um I don't think it is a significant uh
 
01:24:07.250 --> 01:24:07.260 align:start position:0%
factor in where they where they want to
 
01:24:09.410 --> 01:24:09.420 align:start position:0%
be and and where they want to do
 
01:24:15.350 --> 01:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:17.510 --> 01:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
um it's much more is the ability of
 
01:24:20.630 --> 01:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
these that's a huge part of you know
 
01:24:23.689 --> 01:24:23.699 align:start position:0%
high-tech industry as to
 
01:24:26.630 --> 01:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
um where where you locate
 
01:24:28.729 --> 01:24:28.739 align:start position:0%
um and you know we're somewhat of a
 
01:24:31.130 --> 01:24:31.140 align:start position:0%
subsidiary of the Boston area so which
 
01:24:33.950 --> 01:24:33.960 align:start position:0%
is a hotbed of high-tech
 
01:24:39.110 --> 01:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:43.370 --> 01:24:43.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:43.380 --> 01:24:44.649 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:24:44.649 --> 01:24:44.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:47.149 --> 01:24:47.159 align:start position:0%
so if we look at the Boston area do you
 
01:24:48.470 --> 01:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
know what the
 
01:24:50.330 --> 01:24:50.340 align:start position:0%
uh in Massachusetts what they're
 
01:24:59.510 --> 01:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:02.450 --> 01:25:02.460 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:25:02.460 --> 01:25:04.630 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
okay

01:25:04.630 --> 01:25:04.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:25:08.510 --> 01:25:08.520 align:start position:0%
there is one that can be
 
01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:12.430 align:start position:0%
there is one that can be
wrong

01:25:12.430 --> 01:25:12.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:16.669 --> 01:25:16.679 align:start position:0%
I was just asking Jen about this do we
 
01:25:19.070 --> 01:25:19.080 align:start position:0%
do we need to find out who it is
 
01:25:19.080 --> 01:25:22.070 align:start position:0%
do we need to find out who it is
g-t-h-a-l

01:25:22.070 --> 01:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
g-t-h-a-l
 
01:25:25.729 --> 01:25:25.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:27.290 --> 01:25:27.300 align:start position:0%
representative major if you want to
 
01:25:29.149 --> 01:25:29.159 align:start position:0%
continue with your
 
01:25:29.159 --> 01:25:30.350 align:start position:0%
continue with your
um

01:25:30.350 --> 01:25:30.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:33.950 --> 01:25:33.960 align:start position:0%
preferred list or order of calling on
 
01:25:36.290 --> 01:25:36.300 align:start position:0%
speakers you could call on others at the
 
01:25:36.300 --> 01:25:37.430 align:start position:0%
speakers you could call on others at the
end

01:25:37.430 --> 01:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
end
 
01:25:40.070 --> 01:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Jen
 
01:25:42.229 --> 01:25:42.239 align:start position:0%
I'm only
 
01:25:45.229 --> 01:25:45.239 align:start position:0%
responding to hands up to questions at
 
01:25:49.250 --> 01:25:49.260 align:start position:0%
this point in time next breaker
 
01:25:51.850 --> 01:25:51.860 align:start position:0%
is Dave Gervais representing the
 
01:25:56.209 --> 01:25:56.219 align:start position:0%
business and industry Association
 
01:25:58.910 --> 01:25:58.920 align:start position:0%
and he's opposing the bill
 
01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:07.729 align:start position:0%
and he's opposing the bill
David

01:26:07.729 --> 01:26:07.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:09.950 --> 01:26:09.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and members of the
 
01:26:11.510 --> 01:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
House Ways and Means Committee I trust
 
01:26:13.790 --> 01:26:13.800 align:start position:0%
everyone can hear me okay
 
01:26:17.149 --> 01:26:17.159 align:start position:0%
yes for the record my name is Dave Juve
 
01:26:18.890 --> 01:26:18.900 align:start position:0%
I'm a senior vice president for public
 
01:26:20.870 --> 01:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
policy at the business and industry
 
01:26:24.470 --> 01:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
Association we are a New Hampshire based
 
01:26:26.570 --> 01:26:26.580 align:start position:0%
Statewide Chamber of Commerce with
 
01:26:29.810 --> 01:26:29.820 align:start position:0%
approximately 400 members businesses of
 
01:26:31.669 --> 01:26:31.679 align:start position:0%
all sizes from the state's largest
 
01:26:34.610 --> 01:26:34.620 align:start position:0%
companies down to single sole owner
 
01:26:36.830 --> 01:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
operators I appreciate the opportunity
 
01:26:40.010 --> 01:26:40.020 align:start position:0%
to testify in opposition to House Bill
 
01:26:43.669 --> 01:26:43.679 align:start position:0%
210 and the opportunity to explain why
 
01:26:45.890 --> 01:26:45.900 align:start position:0%
this would be a
 
01:26:49.070 --> 01:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
really unfortunate move for for the
 
01:26:51.470 --> 01:26:51.480 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire to take I first
 
01:26:53.870 --> 01:26:53.880 align:start position:0%
want to comment on a couple of things
 
01:26:57.410 --> 01:26:57.420 align:start position:0%
from previous testifiers to I hope
 
01:26:59.470 --> 01:26:59.480 align:start position:0%
um clear up what may be some
 
01:27:02.090 --> 01:27:02.100 align:start position:0%
misunderstandings the first was
 
01:27:02.100 --> 01:27:04.610 align:start position:0%
misunderstandings the first was
representative

01:27:04.610 --> 01:27:04.620 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:27:07.490 --> 01:27:07.500 align:start position:0%
said that the seven million dollars
 
01:27:10.669 --> 01:27:10.679 align:start position:0%
which the state is investing in research
 
01:27:14.530 --> 01:27:14.540 align:start position:0%
and development tax credits was uh in
 
01:27:17.510 --> 01:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
inappropriate budget process or an
 
01:27:19.729 --> 01:27:19.739 align:start position:0%
inappropriate legislative process and I
 
01:27:22.310 --> 01:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
think what he meant by that was there
 
01:27:24.410 --> 01:27:24.420 align:start position:0%
was not a bill that originated in the
 
01:27:26.390 --> 01:27:26.400 align:start position:0%
house increasing the state investment to
 
01:27:29.990 --> 01:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
7 million it was added to the state
 
01:27:33.110 --> 01:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
budget negotiations in the Senate but
 
01:27:36.229 --> 01:27:36.239 align:start position:0%
that bill has all budget bills to come
 
01:27:38.270 --> 01:27:38.280 align:start position:0%
back to the house for concurrence or
 
01:27:40.510 --> 01:27:40.520 align:start position:0%
non-concurrence in this case the house
 
01:27:42.410 --> 01:27:42.420 align:start position:0%
non-concurred which they almost always
 
01:27:44.149 --> 01:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
do and requested a committee of
 
01:27:46.669 --> 01:27:46.679 align:start position:0%
conference and at that point that was
 
01:27:48.649 --> 01:27:48.659 align:start position:0%
the opportunity for the house to
 
01:27:52.250 --> 01:27:52.260 align:start position:0%
question this uh increase in in the
 
01:27:56.450 --> 01:27:56.460 align:start position:0%
state investment or uh if if they felt
 
01:27:59.510 --> 01:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
it was that critical to non-concur on
 
01:28:01.189 --> 01:28:01.199 align:start position:0%
the budget but but it didn't even come
 
01:28:03.950 --> 01:28:03.960 align:start position:0%
up in the discussion so I want to make
 
01:28:06.050 --> 01:28:06.060 align:start position:0%
sure Committee Member understand that
 
01:28:08.450 --> 01:28:08.460 align:start position:0%
the increase in seven million wasn't the
 
01:28:10.370 --> 01:28:10.380 align:start position:0%
result of a specific bill but there was
 
01:28:12.350 --> 01:28:12.360 align:start position:0%
nothing improper about the budgeting
 
01:28:15.050 --> 01:28:15.060 align:start position:0%
process that was undertaken
 
01:28:17.090 --> 01:28:17.100 align:start position:0%
I'd also like to comment on the check
 
01:28:20.810 --> 01:28:20.820 align:start position:0%
box and the representatives correct if
 
01:28:24.649 --> 01:28:24.659 align:start position:0%
we have a research and development tax
 
01:28:27.169 --> 01:28:27.179 align:start position:0%
credit even at a de minimis amount there
 
01:28:29.390 --> 01:28:29.400 align:start position:0%
will be a box that will be checked but I
 
01:28:32.750 --> 01:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
can assure you that uh the program
 
01:28:34.970 --> 01:28:34.980 align:start position:0%
itself and that box will become a
 
01:28:37.310 --> 01:28:37.320 align:start position:0%
laughing stock because if you reduce the
 
01:28:39.890 --> 01:28:39.900 align:start position:0%
state investment to 2 million based on
 
01:28:42.530 --> 01:28:42.540 align:start position:0%
the number of companies that applied in
 
01:28:45.830 --> 01:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
uh fiscal year 2020 they'll be getting a
 
01:28:47.990 --> 01:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
less than 10 cents on the dollar for
 
01:28:50.390 --> 01:28:50.400 align:start position:0%
what they are eligible for under the
 
01:28:51.890 --> 01:28:51.900 align:start position:0%
research and development tax credit
 
01:28:51.900 --> 01:28:53.030 align:start position:0%
research and development tax credit
program

01:28:53.030 --> 01:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:28:54.830 --> 01:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
I'd also like to address a couple of
 
01:28:56.689 --> 01:28:56.699 align:start position:0%
other things
 
01:28:59.149 --> 01:28:59.159 align:start position:0%
um and I worked with with representative
 
01:29:02.810 --> 01:29:02.820 align:start position:0%
Almy back in 2007 the 2007 session where
 
01:29:04.790 --> 01:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
this bill passed it was it was
 
01:29:07.550 --> 01:29:07.560 align:start position:0%
implemented in 2008 that was the first
 
01:29:09.470 --> 01:29:09.480 align:start position:0%
year that companies could take advantage
 
01:29:12.169 --> 01:29:12.179 align:start position:0%
of it and we worked closely together on
 
01:29:14.090 --> 01:29:14.100 align:start position:0%
it and one of the things we worked on
 
01:29:16.070 --> 01:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
that hasn't been brought up was the
 
01:29:16.080 --> 01:29:17.510 align:start position:0%
that hasn't been brought up was the
original

01:29:17.510 --> 01:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
original
 
01:29:19.310 --> 01:29:19.320 align:start position:0%
um language for the bill was the tax
 
01:29:21.709 --> 01:29:21.719 align:start position:0%
credit only applied to business profits
 
01:29:25.970 --> 01:29:25.980 align:start position:0%
taxpayers but we realized early on that
 
01:29:29.030 --> 01:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
our intent uh was that this also be
 
01:29:31.310 --> 01:29:31.320 align:start position:0%
available for for smaller companies that
 
01:29:33.229 --> 01:29:33.239 align:start position:0%
that may not be profitable and are there
 
01:29:35.090 --> 01:29:35.100 align:start position:0%
five therefore only paying the business
 
01:29:37.910 --> 01:29:37.920 align:start position:0%
Enterprise tax and that was added to the
 
01:29:40.129 --> 01:29:40.139 align:start position:0%
bill and that exists in the law to this
 
01:29:42.770 --> 01:29:42.780 align:start position:0%
day we also did some other things to
 
01:29:44.390 --> 01:29:44.400 align:start position:0%
make sure that smaller companies could
 
01:29:46.370 --> 01:29:46.380 align:start position:0%
take advantage of it and that is we
 
01:29:49.129 --> 01:29:49.139 align:start position:0%
capped the total amount of credit that
 
01:29:51.950 --> 01:29:51.960 align:start position:0%
would be given out in any uh given tax
 
01:29:54.950 --> 01:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
year to a maximum of fifty thousand
 
01:29:59.330 --> 01:29:59.340 align:start position:0%
dollars per company and in fact the uh
 
01:30:01.189 --> 01:30:01.199 align:start position:0%
information from the Department of
 
01:30:04.250 --> 01:30:04.260 align:start position:0%
Revenue Administration on the tax
 
01:30:05.990 --> 01:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
research and development tax credit
 
01:30:10.250 --> 01:30:10.260 align:start position:0%
summary which I did uh submit to the
 
01:30:12.110 --> 01:30:12.120 align:start position:0%
committee via email this morning so I'm
 
01:30:14.510 --> 01:30:14.520 align:start position:0%
hoping all committee members will have a
 
01:30:16.850 --> 01:30:16.860 align:start position:0%
chance to review it
 
01:30:16.860 --> 01:30:17.629 align:start position:0%
chance to review it
um

01:30:17.629 --> 01:30:17.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:22.370 --> 01:30:22.380 align:start position:0%
over 230 New Hampshire companies applied
 
01:30:25.129 --> 01:30:25.139 align:start position:0%
for the credit for fiscal year or for uh
 
01:30:28.209 --> 01:30:28.219 align:start position:0%
tax year 2020 so it's more than double
 
01:30:31.970 --> 01:30:31.980 align:start position:0%
uh the hundred dollars at a previous or
 
01:30:33.350 --> 01:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
the 100 companies that are previous
 
01:30:33.360 --> 01:30:35.270 align:start position:0%
the 100 companies that are previous
testifier

01:30:35.270 --> 01:30:35.280 align:start position:0%
testifier
 
01:30:37.910 --> 01:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
um said it's 230 companies and by the
 
01:30:40.250 --> 01:30:40.260 align:start position:0%
way that is increased from the first
 
01:30:44.510 --> 01:30:44.520 align:start position:0%
year of the program from 71 companies so
 
01:30:47.209 --> 01:30:47.219 align:start position:0%
clearly something is going on either
 
01:30:49.189 --> 01:30:49.199 align:start position:0%
there are more companies doing research
 
01:30:52.070 --> 01:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
and development which uh this tax credit
 
01:30:53.709 --> 01:30:53.719 align:start position:0%
is meant to
 
01:30:57.290 --> 01:30:57.300 align:start position:0%
encourage or somehow over the years more
 
01:30:59.629 --> 01:30:59.639 align:start position:0%
companies have heard about it which if
 
01:31:02.930 --> 01:31:02.940 align:start position:0%
if they have uh good accountants they
 
01:31:05.450 --> 01:31:05.460 align:start position:0%
should have heard about it in 2008 but
 
01:31:09.950 --> 01:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
in any event of of those 230 companies
 
01:31:13.370 --> 01:31:13.380 align:start position:0%
uh 94 of the companies received
 
01:31:15.649 --> 01:31:15.659 align:start position:0%
requested less than the fifty thousand
 
01:31:18.050 --> 01:31:18.060 align:start position:0%
dollars in and that's a good indicator
 
01:31:20.149 --> 01:31:20.159 align:start position:0%
that smaller companies are also taking
 
01:31:21.590 --> 01:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
advantage of this research and
 
01:31:23.450 --> 01:31:23.460 align:start position:0%
development tax credit and by the way
 
01:31:26.149 --> 01:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
one of those smaller companies is uh
 
01:31:29.149 --> 01:31:29.159 align:start position:0%
graphic cast which is in Jaffrey I also
 
01:31:31.490 --> 01:31:31.500 align:start position:0%
included in the email this morning a
 
01:31:34.610 --> 01:31:34.620 align:start position:0%
recent uh op-ed piece by Val zanchuk
 
01:31:37.370 --> 01:31:37.380 align:start position:0%
who's the president of graphic cast he
 
01:31:39.470 --> 01:31:39.480 align:start position:0%
is someone who takes advantage of the
 
01:31:41.330 --> 01:31:41.340 align:start position:0%
research and development tax credit in
 
01:31:44.510 --> 01:31:44.520 align:start position:0%
his op-ed says why graphic cast has 23
 
01:31:47.209 --> 01:31:47.219 align:start position:0%
employees so they are not by any stretch
 
01:31:50.510 --> 01:31:50.520 align:start position:0%
of the imagination a large high-tech or
 
01:31:53.390 --> 01:31:53.400 align:start position:0%
large uh manufacturing company but it is
 
01:31:55.729 --> 01:31:55.739 align:start position:0%
critical for them
 
01:31:58.970 --> 01:31:58.980 align:start position:0%
um just a couple of other things
 
01:31:58.980 --> 01:32:00.709 align:start position:0%
um just a couple of other things
um

01:32:00.709 --> 01:32:00.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:03.110 --> 01:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
why does the state do this well one
 
01:32:06.830 --> 01:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
reason is that 33 other states around
 
01:32:09.770 --> 01:32:09.780 align:start position:0%
the country uh have research and
 
01:32:11.930 --> 01:32:11.940 align:start position:0%
development tax credits so this is not
 
01:32:15.649 --> 01:32:15.659 align:start position:0%
exactly an unusual thing and but it is
 
01:32:17.270 --> 01:32:17.280 align:start position:0%
something that New Hampshire needs to be
 
01:32:19.189 --> 01:32:19.199 align:start position:0%
aware of in terms of recruiting
 
01:32:21.229 --> 01:32:21.239 align:start position:0%
companies uh to the state and wanting
 
01:32:23.570 --> 01:32:23.580 align:start position:0%
companies who are already here to expand
 
01:32:26.330 --> 01:32:26.340 align:start position:0%
their operations
 
01:32:28.910 --> 01:32:28.920 align:start position:0%
um but there's more than that uh it is
 
01:32:32.750 --> 01:32:32.760 align:start position:0%
in a compelling State interest to uh
 
01:32:35.330 --> 01:32:35.340 align:start position:0%
encourage and Foster manufacturing and
 
01:32:38.450 --> 01:32:38.460 align:start position:0%
high technology jobs I
 
01:32:41.570 --> 01:32:41.580 align:start position:0%
um have a document here from our state
 
01:32:43.550 --> 01:32:43.560 align:start position:0%
uh Department of Employment Security
 
01:32:47.030 --> 01:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
every year they track average wages and
 
01:32:49.550 --> 01:32:49.560 align:start position:0%
for the entire State uh the average
 
01:32:53.030 --> 01:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
weekly wage for private sector jobs is
 
01:32:54.709 --> 01:32:54.719 align:start position:0%
one thousand one hundred and forty five
 
01:32:57.649 --> 01:32:57.659 align:start position:0%
that's for uh 2019 which is the most
 
01:33:00.490 --> 01:33:00.500 align:start position:0%
recent year they have data for
 
01:33:03.649 --> 01:33:03.659 align:start position:0%
1145 dollars per week
 
01:33:06.830 --> 01:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
um for private sector employment in New
 
01:33:06.840 --> 01:33:08.570 align:start position:0%
um for private sector employment in New
Hampshire

01:33:08.570 --> 01:33:08.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:33:11.870 --> 01:33:11.880 align:start position:0%
in manufacturing they break it out by
 
01:33:14.450 --> 01:33:14.460 align:start position:0%
economic sectors and Manufacturing the
 
01:33:17.510 --> 01:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
average weekly wage is one thousand four
 
01:33:19.790 --> 01:33:19.800 align:start position:0%
hundred and three dollars
 
01:33:22.870 --> 01:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
um roughly
 
01:33:26.930 --> 01:33:26.940 align:start position:0%
250 dollars more uh roughly and if you
 
01:33:28.729 --> 01:33:28.739 align:start position:0%
look at chemical manufacturing they're
 
01:33:30.830 --> 01:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
one thousand six hundred dollars a week
 
01:33:33.530 --> 01:33:33.540 align:start position:0%
and if you look at computer and
 
01:33:35.390 --> 01:33:35.400 align:start position:0%
electronic product manufacturing they're
 
01:33:37.310 --> 01:33:37.320 align:start position:0%
one thousand nine hundred dollars a week
 
01:33:40.669 --> 01:33:40.679 align:start position:0%
so not only are these types of companies
 
01:33:43.970 --> 01:33:43.980 align:start position:0%
providing high-wage jobs which benefits
 
01:33:46.010 --> 01:33:46.020 align:start position:0%
the economy because those wages get
 
01:33:48.890 --> 01:33:48.900 align:start position:0%
plowed back into the economy
 
01:33:50.390 --> 01:33:50.400 align:start position:0%
um but they also benefit the state
 
01:33:52.129 --> 01:33:52.139 align:start position:0%
because as you all know the business
 
01:33:55.189 --> 01:33:55.199 align:start position:0%
Enterprise tax is is is
 
01:33:55.199 --> 01:33:56.450 align:start position:0%
Enterprise tax is is is
um uh

01:33:56.450 --> 01:33:56.460 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
01:33:59.149 --> 01:33:59.159 align:start position:0%
uh almost entirely based on company
 
01:34:02.090 --> 01:34:02.100 align:start position:0%
compensation so if a company is is
 
01:34:04.550 --> 01:34:04.560 align:start position:0%
paying out more in compensation their
 
01:34:06.770 --> 01:34:06.780 align:start position:0%
business Enterprise tax payments will be
 
01:34:09.169 --> 01:34:09.179 align:start position:0%
higher to the state so there is a
 
01:34:10.729 --> 01:34:10.739 align:start position:0%
compelling interest why I'm not
 
01:34:12.530 --> 01:34:12.540 align:start position:0%
suggesting one company is better than
 
01:34:14.450 --> 01:34:14.460 align:start position:0%
the other one economic sector is better
 
01:34:17.330 --> 01:34:17.340 align:start position:0%
than the other uh one job is better than
 
01:34:19.970 --> 01:34:19.980 align:start position:0%
the other but there are differences and
 
01:34:22.430 --> 01:34:22.440 align:start position:0%
uh it's clear that it is in the state's
 
01:34:24.770 --> 01:34:24.780 align:start position:0%
best interest to maintain a healthy
 
01:34:27.050 --> 01:34:27.060 align:start position:0%
manufacturing and high-tech economy and
 
01:34:29.570 --> 01:34:29.580 align:start position:0%
then finally I want to address uh the
 
01:34:32.810 --> 01:34:32.820 align:start position:0%
the issue of this five million dollars
 
01:34:36.169 --> 01:34:36.179 align:start position:0%
now I guess I should state that Bia does
 
01:34:39.110 --> 01:34:39.120 align:start position:0%
not have a position on increasing
 
01:34:40.970 --> 01:34:40.980 align:start position:0%
exemptions for the interest in dividends
 
01:34:43.310 --> 01:34:43.320 align:start position:0%
tax or eliminating it entirely we leave
 
01:34:46.010 --> 01:34:46.020 align:start position:0%
that up to the wisdom of the legislature
 
01:34:48.890 --> 01:34:48.900 align:start position:0%
I would suggest you don't need to rob
 
01:34:50.870 --> 01:34:50.880 align:start position:0%
from one of the state's most successful
 
01:34:53.689 --> 01:34:53.699 align:start position:0%
Economic Development programs to fund
 
01:34:57.610 --> 01:34:57.620 align:start position:0%
that uh in using the department of
 
01:35:00.590 --> 01:35:00.600 align:start position:0%
administrative services
 
01:35:02.810 --> 01:35:02.820 align:start position:0%
um most recent Revenue Focus which is
 
01:35:07.189 --> 01:35:07.199 align:start position:0%
for December of 2020 or uh FY 2021 but
 
01:35:11.149 --> 01:35:11.159 align:start position:0%
December of 2020 uh they say that the
 
01:35:13.250 --> 01:35:13.260 align:start position:0%
state in terms of business profits tax
 
01:35:16.250 --> 01:35:16.260 align:start position:0%
and business Enterprise tax is running
 
01:35:20.149 --> 01:35:20.159 align:start position:0%
in excess of 65 million dollars that's
 
01:35:22.790 --> 01:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
65 million dollars higher than what
 
01:35:25.669 --> 01:35:25.679 align:start position:0%
budgeted projections were for so let's
 
01:35:28.430 --> 01:35:28.440 align:start position:0%
not pretend we can't find five million
 
01:35:32.510 --> 01:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
dollars somewhere if the state uh wants
 
01:35:34.850 --> 01:35:34.860 align:start position:0%
to to increase exemptions or or or
 
01:35:38.750 --> 01:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
eliminate the IND tax uh uh in its
 
01:35:41.810 --> 01:35:41.820 align:start position:0%
entirety you don't need to a
 
01:35:43.729 --> 01:35:43.739 align:start position:0%
successful economic development program
 
01:35:45.410 --> 01:35:45.420 align:start position:0%
one of the few that the state of New
 
01:35:47.629 --> 01:35:47.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire offers in order to do that uh
 
01:35:49.970 --> 01:35:49.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I would be happy to
 
01:35:52.250 --> 01:35:52.260 align:start position:0%
address any questions
 
01:35:55.850 --> 01:35:55.860 align:start position:0%
questions or Representatives chamber
 
01:35:58.689 --> 01:35:58.699 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you Mr Goulet
 
01:36:01.370 --> 01:36:01.380 align:start position:0%
uh a question
 
01:36:05.209 --> 01:36:05.219 align:start position:0%
does the Bia have a statistical number
 
01:36:07.729 --> 01:36:07.739 align:start position:0%
of the new products or improvements to
 
01:36:10.729 --> 01:36:10.739 align:start position:0%
products or jobs or salary increases
 
01:36:13.129 --> 01:36:13.139 align:start position:0%
that are directly related
 
01:36:15.770 --> 01:36:15.780 align:start position:0%
to the last 12 years of research and
 
01:36:19.490 --> 01:36:19.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:21.950 --> 01:36:21.960 align:start position:0%
uh the answer to that question is no and
 
01:36:25.070 --> 01:36:25.080 align:start position:0%
part of the reason why is the Bia nor
 
01:36:27.110 --> 01:36:27.120 align:start position:0%
anyone else outside of the Department of
 
01:36:29.090 --> 01:36:29.100 align:start position:0%
Revenue Administration knows who the
 
01:36:31.430 --> 01:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
companies are I know a few within the
 
01:36:34.010 --> 01:36:34.020 align:start position:0%
Bia membership because they've expressed
 
01:36:37.669 --> 01:36:37.679 align:start position:0%
some concern about uh the research and
 
01:36:40.990 --> 01:36:41.000 align:start position:0%
development tax credit being rolled back
 
01:36:44.149 --> 01:36:44.159 align:start position:0%
as this bill would would uh purport to
 
01:36:46.250 --> 01:36:46.260 align:start position:0%
do in fact the committee heard from two
 
01:36:48.530 --> 01:36:48.540 align:start position:0%
two members valzan Chuck and Tom white
 
01:36:50.330 --> 01:36:50.340 align:start position:0%
from New England wire who spoke about
 
01:36:52.430 --> 01:36:52.440 align:start position:0%
the research and development tax credit
 
01:36:54.410 --> 01:36:54.420 align:start position:0%
when you had your economic briefing
 
01:36:57.470 --> 01:36:57.480 align:start position:0%
several weeks ago but but specifically
 
01:36:59.570 --> 01:36:59.580 align:start position:0%
your question we don't have any way to
 
01:37:01.310 --> 01:37:01.320 align:start position:0%
track that
 
01:37:03.709 --> 01:37:03.719 align:start position:0%
um because we don't know who who all the
 
01:37:07.790 --> 01:37:07.800 align:start position:0%
companies are I can tell you that uh in
 
01:37:12.290 --> 01:37:12.300 align:start position:0%
terms of employment since the tax was
 
01:37:16.550 --> 01:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
implemented in 2008 uh New Hampshire
 
01:37:19.430 --> 01:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
qualified raises New Hampshire qualified
 
01:37:22.310 --> 01:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
wages those that qualified for the
 
01:37:24.110 --> 01:37:24.120 align:start position:0%
research and development tax credit Rose
 
01:37:28.870 --> 01:37:28.880 align:start position:0%
from 112 million per year to over
 
01:37:31.850 --> 01:37:31.860 align:start position:0%
510 million now over a half a billion
 
01:37:33.890 --> 01:37:33.900 align:start position:0%
dollars that's a pretty significant
 
01:37:36.830 --> 01:37:36.840 align:start position:0%
increase over a 12-year period of time
 
01:37:38.689 --> 01:37:38.699 align:start position:0%
and I would suggest that it has
 
01:37:41.689 --> 01:37:41.699 align:start position:0%
increased every year and those first
 
01:37:45.229 --> 01:37:45.239 align:start position:0%
years 2008 2009 and into 2010 you will
 
01:37:47.390 --> 01:37:47.400 align:start position:0%
remember was
 
01:37:47.400 --> 01:37:48.050 align:start position:0%
remember was
um

01:37:48.050 --> 01:37:48.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:51.649 --> 01:37:51.659 align:start position:0%
the uh the Great Recession so even in
 
01:37:54.110 --> 01:37:54.120 align:start position:0%
the Great Recession there was increased
 
01:37:57.709 --> 01:37:57.719 align:start position:0%
uh usage of r d tax credits
 
01:38:04.250 --> 01:38:04.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:06.770 --> 01:38:06.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:38:08.649 --> 01:38:08.659 align:start position:0%
Dave on
 
01:38:14.990 --> 01:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:19.129 --> 01:38:19.139 align:start position:0%
like a reverse waterfall on this this uh
 
01:38:22.430 --> 01:38:22.440 align:start position:0%
tax credit it was started at 1 million
 
01:38:24.470 --> 01:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
in order to
 
01:38:27.229 --> 01:38:27.239 align:start position:0%
to be able
 
01:38:31.430 --> 01:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
to check that box and there were not
 
01:38:34.310 --> 01:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
that many people using it at the
 
01:38:38.110 --> 01:38:38.120 align:start position:0%
beginning because we were targeting
 
01:38:41.510 --> 01:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
on new companies we were targeting young
 
01:38:43.430 --> 01:38:43.440 align:start position:0%
companies the only way we could do it
 
01:38:45.110 --> 01:38:45.120 align:start position:0%
was to keep the amount of money
 
01:38:50.330 --> 01:38:50.340 align:start position:0%
available low per capita we we did cap
 
01:38:53.870 --> 01:38:53.880 align:start position:0%
it as you said and but we had to use the
 
01:38:54.950 --> 01:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
federal tax credit because
 
01:38:56.930 --> 01:38:56.940 align:start position:0%
administratively the state couldn't have
 
01:38:58.669 --> 01:38:58.679 align:start position:0%
handled anything else
 
01:39:03.169 --> 01:39:03.179 align:start position:0%
on but when it was doubled to 2 million
 
01:39:04.910 --> 01:39:04.920 align:start position:0%
because too many people were starting to
 
01:39:06.950 --> 01:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
use it and they were only getting 25 000
 
01:39:12.830 --> 01:39:12.840 align:start position:0%
each uh because it's prorated on they on
 
01:39:15.110 --> 01:39:15.120 align:start position:0%
the number Grow Again to take care of
 
01:39:18.010 --> 01:39:18.020 align:start position:0%
the 2 million and we were back down to
 
01:39:22.070 --> 01:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
2025 each I think it was 17 each the
 
01:39:26.510 --> 01:39:26.520 align:start position:0%
last year on and they put 5 million more
 
01:39:29.810 --> 01:39:29.820 align:start position:0%
in it and it's been growing since then
 
01:39:31.550 --> 01:39:31.560 align:start position:0%
it's under
 
01:39:31.560 --> 01:39:33.290 align:start position:0%
it's under
50

01:39:33.290 --> 01:39:33.300 align:start position:0%
50
 
01:39:35.810 --> 01:39:35.820 align:start position:0%
000 on
 
01:39:39.649 --> 01:39:39.659 align:start position:0%
Sunday if we keep this up and you Bia is
 
01:39:42.350 --> 01:39:42.360 align:start position:0%
the one that that started that has been
 
01:39:45.470 --> 01:39:45.480 align:start position:0%
asking for this on we're going to have a
 
01:39:48.470 --> 01:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
tax credit that's worth 50 million
 
01:39:50.689 --> 01:39:50.699 align:start position:0%
dollars or something like that so how do
 
01:39:54.410 --> 01:39:54.420 align:start position:0%
we avoid that without on going against
 
01:39:57.110 --> 01:39:57.120 align:start position:0%
the the principle of the Constitution
 
01:39:59.990 --> 01:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
that on we have to treat everybody
 
01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:03.050 align:start position:0%
that on we have to treat everybody
equally

01:40:03.050 --> 01:40:03.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:05.090 --> 01:40:05.100 align:start position:0%
um thank you representative almi for the
 
01:40:08.090 --> 01:40:08.100 align:start position:0%
question I have to confess my memory on
 
01:40:11.270 --> 01:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
this is a little different than yours
 
01:40:14.270 --> 01:40:14.280 align:start position:0%
um the the original language of the bill
 
01:40:17.570 --> 01:40:17.580 align:start position:0%
there was no cap at all
 
01:40:20.930 --> 01:40:20.940 align:start position:0%
and uh in house Ways and Means Committee
 
01:40:24.050 --> 01:40:24.060 align:start position:0%
uh there was significant concern about
 
01:40:26.510 --> 01:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
well how do we know what the uh fiscal
 
01:40:28.550 --> 01:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
impact will be how do we know how many
 
01:40:31.310 --> 01:40:31.320 align:start position:0%
people will be taking these credits and
 
01:40:34.550 --> 01:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
the answer was we didn't know nor could
 
01:40:36.770 --> 01:40:36.780 align:start position:0%
we forecast because it had never existed
 
01:40:39.709 --> 01:40:39.719 align:start position:0%
before or at least hadn't existed since
 
01:40:43.010 --> 01:40:43.020 align:start position:0%
the the mid-1990s and so the decision
 
01:40:46.010 --> 01:40:46.020 align:start position:0%
was made uh first of all that we need to
 
01:40:50.510 --> 01:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
somehow uh create a cap to make sure the
 
01:40:52.790 --> 01:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
state is not exposed you know in a way
 
01:40:54.470 --> 01:40:54.480 align:start position:0%
that would be detrimental to the budget
 
01:40:56.570 --> 01:40:56.580 align:start position:0%
and then the decision and this was
 
01:40:59.810 --> 01:40:59.820 align:start position:0%
really uh negotiation and pulling a
 
01:41:01.729 --> 01:41:01.739 align:start position:0%
number out of the air was to have it at
 
01:41:04.729 --> 01:41:04.739 align:start position:0%
a million dollars per year so we could
 
01:41:06.830 --> 01:41:06.840 align:start position:0%
see what the
 
01:41:06.840 --> 01:41:07.490 align:start position:0%
see what the
um

01:41:07.490 --> 01:41:07.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:11.030 --> 01:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
interest and and usage of the r d tax
 
01:41:13.790 --> 01:41:13.800 align:start position:0%
credit was and we all agreed to that it
 
01:41:16.610 --> 01:41:16.620 align:start position:0%
was it was done by Design
 
01:41:18.530 --> 01:41:18.540 align:start position:0%
um as you've noted over the years that's
 
01:41:21.050 --> 01:41:21.060 align:start position:0%
increased from uh one million per year
 
01:41:23.990 --> 01:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
to the current 7 million per year and
 
01:41:25.790 --> 01:41:25.800 align:start position:0%
and by the way I would say at the 1
 
01:41:28.010 --> 01:41:28.020 align:start position:0%
million per year companies that applied
 
01:41:31.490 --> 01:41:31.500 align:start position:0%
in 2008 were only getting 41 of their
 
01:41:33.890 --> 01:41:33.900 align:start position:0%
requests because of the 1 million dollar
 
01:41:37.310 --> 01:41:37.320 align:start position:0%
cap when it was increased to seven
 
01:41:41.390 --> 01:41:41.400 align:start position:0%
million dollars in 2017 uh companies
 
01:41:43.609 --> 01:41:43.619 align:start position:0%
were now getting 92 percent of their
 
01:41:45.169 --> 01:41:45.179 align:start position:0%
requests so still not a hundred percent
 
01:41:49.370 --> 01:41:49.380 align:start position:0%
but close that has gone down since 2017
 
01:41:52.310 --> 01:41:52.320 align:start position:0%
and companies are now as of 2020
 
01:41:55.550 --> 01:41:55.560 align:start position:0%
receiving 76 percent
 
01:41:58.430 --> 01:41:58.440 align:start position:0%
um and I guess the response my response
 
01:42:01.010 --> 01:42:01.020 align:start position:0%
to your question would be
 
01:42:01.020 --> 01:42:02.570 align:start position:0%
to your question would be
um

01:42:02.570 --> 01:42:02.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:06.109 --> 01:42:06.119 align:start position:0%
it's really a matter of State policy and
 
01:42:07.910 --> 01:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
what keeps it from going up to 50
 
01:42:11.149 --> 01:42:11.159 align:start position:0%
million is is that the state has this
 
01:42:15.050 --> 01:42:15.060 align:start position:0%
cap that that uh they won't go beyond
 
01:42:17.030 --> 01:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
and then it's a state decision if how
 
01:42:20.510 --> 01:42:20.520 align:start position:0%
closely they want that cap to match uh
 
01:42:22.790 --> 01:42:22.800 align:start position:0%
demand for the r d tax credit right now
 
01:42:25.310 --> 01:42:25.320 align:start position:0%
they're matching at 75 cents on the
 
01:42:25.320 --> 01:42:26.209 align:start position:0%
they're matching at 75 cents on the
dollar

01:42:26.209 --> 01:42:26.219 align:start position:0%
dollar
 
01:42:27.950 --> 01:42:27.960 align:start position:0%
um if anything we would argue that it
 
01:42:31.070 --> 01:42:31.080 align:start position:0%
might be appropriate to increase uh the
 
01:42:33.470 --> 01:42:33.480 align:start position:0%
cap it hasn't been increased since 2017
 
01:42:35.390 --> 01:42:35.400 align:start position:0%
but we're not asking for that this year
 
01:42:38.870 --> 01:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
but you know everyone knows this is an
 
01:42:41.990 --> 01:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
unusual time in in our country and in
 
01:42:43.970 --> 01:42:43.980 align:start position:0%
the state in the budgeting process is
 
01:42:46.729 --> 01:42:46.739 align:start position:0%
going to be difficult as it is we're not
 
01:42:49.430 --> 01:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
asking for an increase but we are
 
01:42:53.450 --> 01:42:53.460 align:start position:0%
certainly opposing any type of decrease
 
01:43:10.850 --> 01:43:10.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:13.490 --> 01:43:13.500 align:start position:0%
who's talking
 
01:43:16.669 --> 01:43:16.679 align:start position:0%
or push your space bar and talk and hold
 
01:43:20.270 --> 01:43:20.280 align:start position:0%
up yep sorry uh I don't have a question
 
01:43:23.209 --> 01:43:23.219 align:start position:0%
for the president speaker but my
 
01:43:25.669 --> 01:43:25.679 align:start position:0%
question is for representative Lang it's
 
01:43:27.229 --> 01:43:27.239 align:start position:0%
a simple question
 
01:43:29.570 --> 01:43:29.580 align:start position:0%
on page one
 
01:43:32.990 --> 01:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
line 18 and 19
 
01:43:36.109 --> 01:43:36.119 align:start position:0%
where it says exemptions each taxpayer
 
01:43:38.890 --> 01:43:38.900 align:start position:0%
shall have the following exemptions
 
01:43:38.900 --> 01:43:41.050 align:start position:0%
shall have the following exemptions
representative

01:43:41.050 --> 01:43:41.060 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:43:43.790 --> 01:43:43.800 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:43:45.890 --> 01:43:45.900 align:start position:0%
can you hear me Mr Speaker
 
01:43:48.169 --> 01:43:48.179 align:start position:0%
I mean Mr chairman representative
 
01:43:51.850 --> 01:43:51.860 align:start position:0%
Elliott replying doesn't happen to be
 
01:43:56.149 --> 01:43:56.159 align:start position:0%
uh in the room with us right now all
 
01:43:59.270 --> 01:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
right maybe you know then the answer on
 
01:44:01.790 --> 01:44:01.800 align:start position:0%
line 19 the income of thirty five
 
01:44:04.910 --> 01:44:04.920 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars it doesn't say how long
 
01:44:07.370 --> 01:44:07.380 align:start position:0%
that is and the previous speaker
 
01:44:11.350 --> 01:44:11.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned that the average per week is
 
01:44:14.810 --> 01:44:14.820 align:start position:0%
1145 dollars a week which comes to
 
01:44:18.109 --> 01:44:18.119 align:start position:0%
almost sixty thousand dollars so I don't
 
01:44:21.770 --> 01:44:21.780 align:start position:0%
understand line 19 where it says income
 
01:44:24.530 --> 01:44:24.540 align:start position:0%
of thirty five hundred dollars how long
 
01:44:29.270 --> 01:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:31.910 --> 01:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
and how can you live on that that's one
 
01:44:33.050 --> 01:44:33.060 align:start position:0%
year Bob
 
01:44:35.209 --> 01:44:35.219 align:start position:0%
that's for one year
 
01:44:35.219 --> 01:44:37.430 align:start position:0%
that's for one year
yeah

01:44:37.430 --> 01:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:37.440 --> 01:44:38.750 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:44:38.750 --> 01:44:38.760 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:44:41.570 --> 01:44:41.580 align:start position:0%
on representative Elliott that's only
 
01:44:45.050 --> 01:44:45.060 align:start position:0%
the interest in dividends
 
01:44:47.330 --> 01:44:47.340 align:start position:0%
oh okay that's
 
01:44:49.729 --> 01:44:49.739 align:start position:0%
that that's not their total income
 
01:44:52.550 --> 01:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
that's just on the dividend okay thank
 
01:45:01.669 --> 01:45:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:04.550 --> 01:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
I don't see any other raised fans right
 
01:45:05.920 --> 01:45:05.930 align:start position:0%
now if there is
 
01:45:05.930 --> 01:45:07.729 align:start position:0%
now if there is
[Music]

01:45:07.729 --> 01:45:07.739 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:45:07.739 --> 01:45:11.870 align:start position:0%
[Music]
continue

01:45:11.870 --> 01:45:11.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:14.149 --> 01:45:14.159 align:start position:0%
since it was more about raised hands and
 
01:45:19.669 --> 01:45:19.679 align:start position:0%
we'll go to Devin Radford from the dra
 
01:45:19.679 --> 01:45:22.490 align:start position:0%
we'll go to Devin Radford from the dra
um

01:45:22.490 --> 01:45:22.500 align:start position:0%

if you could if you could unmute both of

Devin thank you so
 
01:46:01.609 --> 01:46:01.619 align:start position:0%
HP 210 Section 1 would increase the
 
01:46:05.450 --> 01:46:05.460 align:start position:0%
filing threshold from 24 to 3500 in
 
01:46:07.430 --> 01:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
section 2 it increases the additional
 
01:46:10.070 --> 01:46:10.080 align:start position:0%
exemptions of being blind disabled or 65
 
01:46:12.770 --> 01:46:12.780 align:start position:0%
years of age or older including spouses
 
01:46:16.310 --> 01:46:16.320 align:start position:0%
from 1200 to 1750. these two sections
 
01:46:19.010 --> 01:46:19.020 align:start position:0%
would take effect January 1st 2022
 
01:46:20.990 --> 01:46:21.000 align:start position:0%
and apply to tax years ending on or
 
01:46:25.370 --> 01:46:25.380 align:start position:0%
after December 31st 2022.
 
01:46:27.950 --> 01:46:27.960 align:start position:0%
we've applied these changes to tax your
 
01:46:29.810 --> 01:46:29.820 align:start position:0%
2018 data
 
01:46:32.090 --> 01:46:32.100 align:start position:0%
and it would have resulted in a decrease
 
01:46:36.350 --> 01:46:36.360 align:start position:0%
in revenue of about 5.1 million
 
01:46:39.290 --> 01:46:39.300 align:start position:0%
lastly is important to note that this
 
01:46:40.430 --> 01:46:40.440 align:start position:0%
does not take into account any
 
01:46:42.050 --> 01:46:42.060 align:start position:0%
overpayments or credits that are on file
 
01:46:44.750 --> 01:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
much like the previous bill
 
01:46:46.310 --> 01:46:46.320 align:start position:0%
section three of the proposed
 
01:46:48.350 --> 01:46:48.360 align:start position:0%
legislation as previously explained
 
01:46:50.810 --> 01:46:50.820 align:start position:0%
decreases the aggregate amount that we
 
01:46:53.149 --> 01:46:53.159 align:start position:0%
can award for the r d taxpayer program
 
01:46:56.149 --> 01:46:56.159 align:start position:0%
from 7 million Down 2 million
 
01:46:58.070 --> 01:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
um for any fiscal year effective July
 
01:47:01.129 --> 01:47:01.139 align:start position:0%
1st 2021 this would result in an
 
01:47:01.139 --> 01:47:02.149 align:start position:0%
1st 2021 this would result in an
increase

01:47:02.149 --> 01:47:02.159 align:start position:0%
increase
 
01:47:04.669 --> 01:47:04.679 align:start position:0%
of up to 5 million state general and
 
01:47:07.189 --> 01:47:07.199 align:start position:0%
education trust fund revenues
 
01:47:09.290 --> 01:47:09.300 align:start position:0%
the dra cannot determine the potential
 
01:47:10.790 --> 01:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
increase in Revenue in future years
 
01:47:12.530 --> 01:47:12.540 align:start position:0%
because it has no way of knowing the
 
01:47:14.570 --> 01:47:14.580 align:start position:0%
extent to which they would use these
 
01:47:17.149 --> 01:47:17.159 align:start position:0%
previously awarded r d tax credits
 
01:47:19.310 --> 01:47:19.320 align:start position:0%
because it's important to note that the
 
01:47:21.290 --> 01:47:21.300 align:start position:0%
r d tax credit New Hampshire as a
 
01:47:23.209 --> 01:47:23.219 align:start position:0%
basically a five-year carry forward
 
01:47:25.129 --> 01:47:25.139 align:start position:0%
they're able to use that r d tax credit
 
01:47:27.890 --> 01:47:27.900 align:start position:0%
toward business liability within the
 
01:47:30.169 --> 01:47:30.179 align:start position:0%
five subsequent taxable periods beyond
 
01:47:32.570 --> 01:47:32.580 align:start position:0%
the period which it's earned
 
01:47:34.430 --> 01:47:34.440 align:start position:0%
if you have any other any questions I'll
 
01:47:36.709 --> 01:47:36.719 align:start position:0%
be happy to answer them
 
01:47:36.719 --> 01:47:37.790 align:start position:0%
be happy to answer them
okay

01:47:37.790 --> 01:47:37.800 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:47:48.649 --> 01:47:48.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:48.659 --> 01:47:49.609 align:start position:0%
 
on

01:47:49.609 --> 01:47:49.619 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:47:53.870 --> 01:47:53.880 align:start position:0%
Devin and Melissa on two things one of
 
01:47:57.470 --> 01:47:57.480 align:start position:0%
them could you give us a historical list
 
01:47:59.990 --> 01:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
of the numbers that got the tax credit
 
01:48:03.649 --> 01:48:03.659 align:start position:0%
since it began per year and how much
 
01:48:07.550 --> 01:48:07.560 align:start position:0%
they got each time of that 50
 
01:48:10.609 --> 01:48:10.619 align:start position:0%
000 cap yes that's actually provided in
 
01:48:13.090 --> 01:48:13.100 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Department of Revenue
 
01:48:15.350 --> 01:48:15.360 align:start position:0%
research development tax credit summary
 
01:48:17.629 --> 01:48:17.639 align:start position:0%
women happy to forward that along to the
 
01:48:19.669 --> 01:48:19.679 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I believe Mr
 
01:48:21.229 --> 01:48:21.239 align:start position:0%
Juve did mention the email that this
 
01:48:23.090 --> 01:48:23.100 align:start position:0%
morning as well but we can go ahead and
 
01:48:24.530 --> 01:48:24.540 align:start position:0%
report that to you
 
01:48:27.770 --> 01:48:27.780 align:start position:0%
um if it's in his email I didn't have a
 
01:48:29.390 --> 01:48:29.400 align:start position:0%
chance to look at it yet I had another
 
01:48:31.550 --> 01:48:31.560 align:start position:0%
meeting that's no problem and just to
 
01:48:33.350 --> 01:48:33.360 align:start position:0%
confirm I'll uh I believe all the
 
01:48:34.970 --> 01:48:34.980 align:start position:0%
information he gave you off that sharp
 
01:48:38.270 --> 01:48:38.280 align:start position:0%
is accurate when you see that chart
 
01:48:39.890 --> 01:48:39.900 align:start position:0%
um just note that the the top of the
 
01:48:41.330 --> 01:48:41.340 align:start position:0%
chart is obviously the first year of the
 
01:48:43.189 --> 01:48:43.199 align:start position:0%
program and if you were to look to the
 
01:48:45.350 --> 01:48:45.360 align:start position:0%
far right of that chart it shows a
 
01:48:47.510 --> 01:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
percentage of requested value that's
 
01:48:50.390 --> 01:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
actually awarded so the r d tax credit
 
01:48:52.250 --> 01:48:52.260 align:start position:0%
is based on 10 percent of qualified
 
01:48:54.470 --> 01:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
wages to New Hampshire
 
01:48:56.689 --> 01:48:56.699 align:start position:0%
capped at fifty thousand
 
01:48:59.390 --> 01:48:59.400 align:start position:0%
or prorated whichever is lesser of the
 
01:49:01.310 --> 01:49:01.320 align:start position:0%
three every year the program has
 
01:49:03.109 --> 01:49:03.119 align:start position:0%
previously stated the requested amounts
 
01:49:04.609 --> 01:49:04.619 align:start position:0%
that exceeded the amount of the
 
01:49:06.830 --> 01:49:06.840 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue award so every
 
01:49:08.810 --> 01:49:08.820 align:start position:0%
year there's a proration that's applied
 
01:49:11.510 --> 01:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
equally across all applicants those
 
01:49:13.070 --> 01:49:13.080 align:start position:0%
percentages are listed in the far right
 
01:49:15.669 --> 01:49:15.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:19.129 --> 01:49:19.139 align:start position:0%
thank you the other question was I
 
01:49:21.410 --> 01:49:21.420 align:start position:0%
wasn't able to be here for the last bill
 
01:49:24.890 --> 01:49:24.900 align:start position:0%
but in the last bill you calculated on
 
01:49:27.370 --> 01:49:27.380 align:start position:0%
the base of tax year
 
01:49:31.790 --> 01:49:31.800 align:start position:0%
on 19. and for this one you use tax year
 
01:49:31.800 --> 01:49:33.229 align:start position:0%
on 19. and for this one you use tax year
18.

01:49:33.229 --> 01:49:33.239 align:start position:0%
18.
 
01:49:35.390 --> 01:49:35.400 align:start position:0%
yeah and for another one I think it was
 
01:49:37.550 --> 01:49:37.560 align:start position:0%
tax year 20 so
 
01:49:40.430 --> 01:49:40.440 align:start position:0%
for these for these two IND bills that
 
01:49:41.990 --> 01:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
was a timing thing of when we when we
 
01:49:43.729 --> 01:49:43.739 align:start position:0%
received the fiscal when we completed it
 
01:49:46.850 --> 01:49:46.860 align:start position:0%
I did take a look at the applied this
 
01:49:49.790 --> 01:49:49.800 align:start position:0%
bill to tax your 2019 liability and the
 
01:49:52.070 --> 01:49:52.080 align:start position:0%
difference was minimal was about 400 000
 
01:49:54.590 --> 01:49:54.600 align:start position:0%
difference on the IND portion of this
 
01:49:54.600 --> 01:49:56.209 align:start position:0%
difference on the IND portion of this
bill

01:49:56.209 --> 01:49:56.219 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:49:58.370 --> 01:49:58.380 align:start position:0%
so the number the overall impact did not
 
01:50:00.590 --> 01:50:00.600 align:start position:0%
change very much with this depending on
 
01:50:03.770 --> 01:50:03.780 align:start position:0%
which tattoo you applied it to
 
01:50:06.229 --> 01:50:06.239 align:start position:0%
normally I I guess the other bill that
 
01:50:07.850 --> 01:50:07.860 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that tax your 20 but we
 
01:50:09.649 --> 01:50:09.659 align:start position:0%
don't have complete data for tax year 20
 
01:50:11.870 --> 01:50:11.880 align:start position:0%
yet so in this particular instance I
 
01:50:13.970 --> 01:50:13.980 align:start position:0%
would not have used that for IND
 
01:50:13.980 --> 01:50:18.590 align:start position:0%
would not have used that for IND
analysis

01:50:18.590 --> 01:50:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:21.830 --> 01:50:21.840 align:start position:0%

01:53:20.689 --> 01:53:20.699 align:start position:0%
good morning this is representative
 
01:53:23.450 --> 01:53:23.460 align:start position:0%
Daryl Abbas I uh represent a Rockingham
 
01:53:25.790 --> 01:53:25.800 align:start position:0%
County District 8. I wanted to thank the
 
01:53:27.890 --> 01:53:27.900 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for all right
 
01:53:32.330 --> 01:53:32.340 align:start position:0%
hearing me today uh the reason this bill
 
01:53:36.290 --> 01:53:36.300 align:start position:0%
I put this bill forward is so in in S
 
01:53:38.149 --> 01:53:38.159 align:start position:0%
Corp in Massachusetts that operates
 
01:53:40.070 --> 01:53:40.080 align:start position:0%
solely in Massachusetts
 
01:53:41.990 --> 01:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh what is occurring
 
01:53:44.870 --> 01:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
is it if you are a resident of New
 
01:53:44.880 --> 01:53:45.770 align:start position:0%
is it if you are a resident of New
Hampshire

01:53:45.770 --> 01:53:45.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:53:47.750 --> 01:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
and even though you're operating solely
 
01:53:50.330 --> 01:53:50.340 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts you are paying a double
 
01:53:54.530 --> 01:53:54.540 align:start position:0%
tax on the income earned through being
 
01:53:56.629 --> 01:53:56.639 align:start position:0%
paid to dividends a dividend as a
 
01:53:59.270 --> 01:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
shareholder of the corporation
 
01:54:02.870 --> 01:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
even if the that S Corp operates solely
 
01:54:04.930 --> 01:54:04.940 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts
 
01:54:08.090 --> 01:54:08.100 align:start position:0%
and all the work is performed there but
 
01:54:09.470 --> 01:54:09.480 align:start position:0%
you just happen to reside in New
 
01:54:09.480 --> 01:54:10.129 align:start position:0%
you just happen to reside in New
Hampshire

01:54:10.129 --> 01:54:10.139 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:54:13.669 --> 01:54:13.679 align:start position:0%
now the problem occurs is that and why
 
01:54:16.729 --> 01:54:16.739 align:start position:0%
that's happening is in Massachusetts the
 
01:54:18.470 --> 01:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
dividend that is paid
 
01:54:21.470 --> 01:54:21.480 align:start position:0%
they are classifying that as
 
01:54:23.990 --> 01:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
an income tax so it's being it's
 
01:54:26.149 --> 01:54:26.159 align:start position:0%
categorized as an individual income tax
 
01:54:28.910 --> 01:54:28.920 align:start position:0%
tax at the same rate and just put into
 
01:54:30.830 --> 01:54:30.840 align:start position:0%
uh when you file your tax that's what it
 
01:54:31.850 --> 01:54:31.860 align:start position:0%
falls under
 
01:54:33.649 --> 01:54:33.659 align:start position:0%
because in New Hampshire we don't have
 
01:54:35.570 --> 01:54:35.580 align:start position:0%
an income tax and I pray to God we never
 
01:54:35.580 --> 01:54:36.350 align:start position:0%
an income tax and I pray to God we never
do

01:54:36.350 --> 01:54:36.360 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:54:39.050 --> 01:54:39.060 align:start position:0%
we are class New Hampshire we classify
 
01:54:41.209 --> 01:54:41.219 align:start position:0%
that as a dividends tax so what is
 
01:54:44.930 --> 01:54:44.940 align:start position:0%
happening is that normally they were
 
01:54:46.550 --> 01:54:46.560 align:start position:0%
both in income tax they would be an
 
01:54:46.560 --> 01:54:47.570 align:start position:0%
both in income tax they would be an
offset

01:54:47.570 --> 01:54:47.580 align:start position:0%
offset
 
01:54:49.550 --> 01:54:49.560 align:start position:0%
from between the states but we are not
 
01:54:51.290 --> 01:54:51.300 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is not offering that
 
01:54:54.590 --> 01:54:54.600 align:start position:0%
offset or that credit because they're
 
01:54:56.450 --> 01:54:56.460 align:start position:0%
calling it something different
 
01:54:58.370 --> 01:54:58.380 align:start position:0%
I looked I've always looked at that it's
 
01:55:01.010 --> 01:55:01.020 align:start position:0%
When in Rome if you're earning it in
 
01:55:03.890 --> 01:55:03.900 align:start position:0%
Rome it should be taxed under homes law
 
01:55:06.169 --> 01:55:06.179 align:start position:0%
so if you're operating solely in
 
01:55:07.970 --> 01:55:07.980 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and all the works done
 
01:55:09.229 --> 01:55:09.239 align:start position:0%
there you just happen to have a New
 
01:55:10.490 --> 01:55:10.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire address
 
01:55:12.350 --> 01:55:12.360 align:start position:0%
and that's where you reside
 
01:55:13.669 --> 01:55:13.679 align:start position:0%
it shouldn't be called something
 
01:55:15.890 --> 01:55:15.900 align:start position:0%
different by New Hampshire so
 
01:55:19.669 --> 01:55:19.679 align:start position:0%
it's been well set by
 
01:55:21.590 --> 01:55:21.600 align:start position:0%
Supreme the Supreme Court on more than
 
01:55:24.250 --> 01:55:24.260 align:start position:0%
one occasion at a double taxation is
 
01:55:26.990 --> 01:55:27.000 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional and violates the
 
01:55:29.810 --> 01:55:29.820 align:start position:0%
dormant uh Commerce Clause
 
01:55:29.820 --> 01:55:31.070 align:start position:0%
dormant uh Commerce Clause
and

01:55:31.070 --> 01:55:31.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:55:34.070 --> 01:55:34.080 align:start position:0%
I would call this a violation of the
 
01:55:34.080 --> 01:55:35.209 align:start position:0%
I would call this a violation of the
dormant

01:55:35.209 --> 01:55:35.219 align:start position:0%
dormant
 
01:55:37.070 --> 01:55:37.080 align:start position:0%
Commerce Clause that's my interpretation
 
01:55:39.530 --> 01:55:39.540 align:start position:0%
that it looks like that is happening
 
01:55:42.830 --> 01:55:42.840 align:start position:0%
what I would say is that in this case if
 
01:55:44.450 --> 01:55:44.460 align:start position:0%
anything they would need to be an offset
 
01:55:46.310 --> 01:55:46.320 align:start position:0%
which we're just not doing
 
01:55:49.490 --> 01:55:49.500 align:start position:0%
now not everyone agrees with me on on
 
01:55:52.370 --> 01:55:52.380 align:start position:0%
this I have shown some of the research
 
01:55:53.810 --> 01:55:53.820 align:start position:0%
I've done to other members and I
 
01:55:55.910 --> 01:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
understand it's a disagreement but
 
01:55:58.430 --> 01:55:58.440 align:start position:0%
that aside the disagreement aside I
 
01:56:00.890 --> 01:56:00.900 align:start position:0%
still look at it as a bad policy it
 
01:56:03.169 --> 01:56:03.179 align:start position:0%
would completely disincent uh
 
01:56:05.810 --> 01:56:05.820 align:start position:0%
anyone from who's a shareholder in a
 
01:56:07.550 --> 01:56:07.560 align:start position:0%
corporation from wanting to live in New
 
01:56:10.010 --> 01:56:10.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if they primarily working in
 
01:56:13.129 --> 01:56:13.139 align:start position:0%
another state having to pay that State's
 
01:56:15.109 --> 01:56:15.119 align:start position:0%
income tax and New Hampshire's dividends
 
01:56:15.119 --> 01:56:16.129 align:start position:0%
income tax and New Hampshire's dividends
tax

01:56:16.129 --> 01:56:16.139 align:start position:0%
tax
 
01:56:18.950 --> 01:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
it just to me that's an extra high cost
 
01:56:21.950 --> 01:56:21.960 align:start position:0%
that you can be paying in taxes
 
01:56:24.590 --> 01:56:24.600 align:start position:0%
so I I look at I really look at that as
 
01:56:26.750 --> 01:56:26.760 align:start position:0%
a bad policy
 
01:56:26.760 --> 01:56:28.370 align:start position:0%
a bad policy
where

01:56:28.370 --> 01:56:28.380 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:56:30.229 --> 01:56:30.239 align:start position:0%
if you don't agree with them on the
 
01:56:32.030 --> 01:56:32.040 align:start position:0%
legality of this I would still ask this
 
01:56:32.040 --> 01:56:33.709 align:start position:0%
legality of this I would still ask this
uh

01:56:33.709 --> 01:56:33.719 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:56:36.590 --> 01:56:36.600 align:start position:0%
support and passing this I've been asked
 
01:56:38.209 --> 01:56:38.219 align:start position:0%
a lot of questions about how would this
 
01:56:41.750 --> 01:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
impact the current uh lawsuit going on
 
01:56:44.209 --> 01:56:44.219 align:start position:0%
that's before The Supreme Court I don't
 
01:56:45.530 --> 01:56:45.540 align:start position:0%
believe this would have any any
 
01:56:46.790 --> 01:56:46.800 align:start position:0%
influence on that because that's
 
01:56:49.250 --> 01:56:49.260 align:start position:0%
involving a person working in solely in
 
01:56:50.270 --> 01:56:50.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
01:56:52.910 --> 01:56:52.920 align:start position:0%
it's not and then they're being taxed
 
01:56:56.030 --> 01:56:56.040 align:start position:0%
income tax in Massachusetts so it's
 
01:56:58.070 --> 01:56:58.080 align:start position:0%
actually somewhat the opposite this is
 
01:57:00.709 --> 01:57:00.719 align:start position:0%
in this scenario the person the
 
01:57:02.750 --> 01:57:02.760 align:start position:0%
individual is still working and
 
01:57:05.330 --> 01:57:05.340 align:start position:0%
operating in in Massachusetts and
 
01:57:06.530 --> 01:57:06.540 align:start position:0%
they're still going that way they're
 
01:57:07.790 --> 01:57:07.800 align:start position:0%
going there for work and they're still
 
01:57:09.890 --> 01:57:09.900 align:start position:0%
being subject to the double taxation I
 
01:57:10.970 --> 01:57:10.980 align:start position:0%
think it's very different when we're
 
01:57:12.350 --> 01:57:12.360 align:start position:0%
talking about an individual income tax
 
01:57:14.030 --> 01:57:14.040 align:start position:0%
not the dividends not the shareholder
 
01:57:16.129 --> 01:57:16.139 align:start position:0%
just the actual employee so I don't
 
01:57:18.050 --> 01:57:18.060 align:start position:0%
believe the two uh would have any impact
 
01:57:19.310 --> 01:57:19.320 align:start position:0%
on each other
 
01:57:21.890 --> 01:57:21.900 align:start position:0%
so I'm looking at this as something that
 
01:57:23.450 --> 01:57:23.460 align:start position:0%
would encourage people who are living
 
01:57:25.129 --> 01:57:25.139 align:start position:0%
here to stay here but also even more
 
01:57:27.350 --> 01:57:27.360 align:start position:0%
people to move here and I think it would
 
01:57:27.360 --> 01:57:28.609 align:start position:0%
people to move here and I think it would
really

01:57:28.609 --> 01:57:28.619 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:57:30.890 --> 01:57:30.900 align:start position:0%
result in an economic boost especially
 
01:57:33.649 --> 01:57:33.659 align:start position:0%
along the bordering towns all through
 
01:57:35.089 --> 01:57:35.099 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire not just the southern
 
01:57:36.649 --> 01:57:36.659 align:start position:0%
border I think it would support the
 
01:57:39.830 --> 01:57:39.840 align:start position:0%
borders on both uh by Vermont and Maine
 
01:57:43.070 --> 01:57:43.080 align:start position:0%
as well and I can answer any questions
 
01:57:43.080 --> 01:57:58.450 align:start position:0%
as well and I can answer any questions
foreign

01:57:58.450 --> 01:57:58.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:58.460 --> 01:58:00.850 align:start position:0%
 
I

01:58:00.850 --> 01:58:00.860 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:58:03.290 --> 01:58:03.300 align:start position:0%
think what you're you're talking about
 
01:58:05.390 --> 01:58:05.400 align:start position:0%
is uh distributions
 
01:58:08.030 --> 01:58:08.040 align:start position:0%
that are given uh I was an owner of a
 
01:58:10.609 --> 01:58:10.619 align:start position:0%
company or co-owner of a company in
 
01:58:10.619 --> 01:58:12.050 align:start position:0%
company or co-owner of a company in
Massachusetts

01:58:12.050 --> 01:58:12.060 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts
 
01:58:14.689 --> 01:58:14.699 align:start position:0%
and then uh when we incorporate it as an
 
01:58:17.350 --> 01:58:17.360 align:start position:0%
S corp we didn't realize that
 
01:58:20.270 --> 01:58:20.280 align:start position:0%
distributions that I got to pay
 
01:58:23.229 --> 01:58:23.239 align:start position:0%
my income taxes my federal taxes
 
01:58:26.229 --> 01:58:26.239 align:start position:0%
was treated I also had to pay state
 
01:58:29.089 --> 01:58:29.099 align:start position:0%
taxes on it on Massachusetts
 
01:58:31.689 --> 01:58:31.699 align:start position:0%
uh but that distribution was counted as
 
01:58:36.070 --> 01:58:36.080 align:start position:0%
Inc uh uh a dividend kind of uh
 
01:58:40.250 --> 01:58:40.260 align:start position:0%
income in New Hampshire so I I for 38
 
01:58:43.550 --> 01:58:43.560 align:start position:0%
years I've I had to pay the double tax I
 
01:58:46.250 --> 01:58:46.260 align:start position:0%
agree that this is a quirk and we had a
 
01:58:48.109 --> 01:58:48.119 align:start position:0%
bill about
 
01:58:51.589 --> 01:58:51.599 align:start position:0%
um maybe eight years ago seven years ago
 
01:58:55.370 --> 01:58:55.380 align:start position:0%
very much like this uh where we we
 
01:58:57.649 --> 01:58:57.659 align:start position:0%
discussed this and I was I was very
 
01:58:59.990 --> 01:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
happy thinking that this would get me
 
01:59:01.550 --> 01:59:01.560 align:start position:0%
out from underneath it
 
01:59:05.209 --> 01:59:05.219 align:start position:0%
uh but what happened then was that the
 
01:59:08.209 --> 01:59:08.219 align:start position:0%
uh we did the math on it and there were
 
01:59:11.089 --> 01:59:11.099 align:start position:0%
a lot more winners than losers or losers
 
01:59:12.169 --> 01:59:12.179 align:start position:0%
or winners depending on which
 
01:59:14.510 --> 01:59:14.520 align:start position:0%
perspective you had in terms of state
 
01:59:16.970 --> 01:59:16.980 align:start position:0%
revenue so but I just want to clarify
 
01:59:18.229 --> 01:59:18.239 align:start position:0%
that's what you're talking about the
 
01:59:20.689 --> 01:59:20.699 align:start position:0%
correct distribution
 
01:59:23.930 --> 01:59:23.940 align:start position:0%
and I think the dra will uh add a little
 
01:59:26.089 --> 01:59:26.099 align:start position:0%
clarity as well when they testify but
 
01:59:28.010 --> 01:59:28.020 align:start position:0%
you're talking about distributions I
 
01:59:29.689 --> 01:59:29.699 align:start position:0%
mean I mean that's exactly what I'm
 
01:59:31.250 --> 01:59:31.260 align:start position:0%
talking about the distributions from
 
01:59:34.129 --> 01:59:34.139 align:start position:0%
being paid a dividend and I'm sorry that
 
01:59:35.990 --> 01:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
you had to do that for 38 years because
 
01:59:38.330 --> 01:59:38.340 align:start position:0%
I I look at that the case that I'm
 
01:59:41.030 --> 01:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
referenced from the Supreme Court that
 
01:59:42.470 --> 01:59:42.480 align:start position:0%
clarified this
 
01:59:45.950 --> 01:59:45.960 align:start position:0%
came out in 2015 and the the caution
 
01:59:47.510 --> 01:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
with that and I understand they can be
 
01:59:49.310 --> 01:59:49.320 align:start position:0%
winners and losers but the caution is is
 
01:59:52.609 --> 01:59:52.619 align:start position:0%
that Maryland lost and what happened to
 
01:59:54.350 --> 01:59:54.360 align:start position:0%
Maryland is and I believe another state
 
01:59:57.290 --> 01:59:57.300 align:start position:0%
was caused they had to refund a lot of
 
02:00:01.250 --> 02:00:01.260 align:start position:0%
tax revenue to to taxpayers so there is
 
02:00:03.229 --> 02:00:03.239 align:start position:0%
a a concern that if someone were to
 
02:00:05.390 --> 02:00:05.400 align:start position:0%
challenge this and be successful and I
 
02:00:07.490 --> 02:00:07.500 align:start position:0%
know if it was me and I just to give
 
02:00:09.589 --> 02:00:09.599 align:start position:0%
full disclosure I don't have any share I
 
02:00:10.729 --> 02:00:10.739 align:start position:0%
don't own any shares in any S
 
02:00:13.609 --> 02:00:13.619 align:start position:0%
corporation I'm just if someone did
 
02:00:16.790 --> 02:00:16.800 align:start position:0%
challenges they can be a large bill that
 
02:00:18.229 --> 02:00:18.239 align:start position:0%
the state would have to pay
 
02:00:20.810 --> 02:00:20.820 align:start position:0%
uh this doesn't necessarily remove that
 
02:00:23.810 --> 02:00:23.820 align:start position:0%
liability but it also it is I've been a
 
02:00:27.709 --> 02:00:27.719 align:start position:0%
Talk Amongst a lot of CPAs throughout uh
 
02:00:29.570 --> 02:00:29.580 align:start position:0%
both States and I've I've had it I've
 
02:00:31.370 --> 02:00:31.380 align:start position:0%
had even the conversation my own CPA
 
02:00:33.290 --> 02:00:33.300 align:start position:0%
about it just you know what does he
 
02:00:35.990 --> 02:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
think and it can be a big problem this
 
02:00:37.550 --> 02:00:37.560 align:start position:0%
actually came to a head so this is also
 
02:00:40.250 --> 02:00:40.260 align:start position:0%
a proactive situation just kind of put
 
02:00:42.350 --> 02:00:42.360 align:start position:0%
put an end to this so it's not a problem
 
02:00:43.430 --> 02:00:43.440 align:start position:0%
going forward
 
02:00:49.070 --> 02:00:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:50.990 --> 02:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh thank you
 
02:00:52.910 --> 02:00:52.920 align:start position:0%
representative Abbas for bringing this
 
02:00:54.410 --> 02:00:54.420 align:start position:0%
to us today
 
02:00:56.030 --> 02:00:56.040 align:start position:0%
um I I'm going to give a little analogy
 
02:00:57.410 --> 02:00:57.420 align:start position:0%
and then ask you I'm just trying to
 
02:00:59.990 --> 02:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
clear up my head on this
 
02:01:02.450 --> 02:01:02.460 align:start position:0%
um I worked in the payroll uh for many
 
02:01:05.209 --> 02:01:05.219 align:start position:0%
many years and uh inside those
 
02:01:07.129 --> 02:01:07.139 align:start position:0%
computations we would always get into
 
02:01:08.870 --> 02:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
arguments on whether or not you were
 
02:01:10.910 --> 02:01:10.920 align:start position:0%
going to be taxed where you live or
 
02:01:12.890 --> 02:01:12.900 align:start position:0%
where you worked and I had many
 
02:01:15.050 --> 02:01:15.060 align:start position:0%
different uh conversations with those
 
02:01:16.550 --> 02:01:16.560 align:start position:0%
above me and the different companies
 
02:01:18.410 --> 02:01:18.420 align:start position:0%
that I work for about
 
02:01:20.570 --> 02:01:20.580 align:start position:0%
is this is this sort of applying the
 
02:01:23.030 --> 02:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
same here of what I'm understanding is
 
02:01:25.189 --> 02:01:25.199 align:start position:0%
that you live in New Hampshire you're
 
02:01:27.229 --> 02:01:27.239 align:start position:0%
being taxed in New Hampshire and you're
 
02:01:29.270 --> 02:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
being taxed in Massachusetts is this a
 
02:01:32.750 --> 02:01:32.760 align:start position:0%
live work or live operate uh uh
 
02:01:34.669 --> 02:01:34.679 align:start position:0%
suggestion here
 
02:01:36.890 --> 02:01:36.900 align:start position:0%
it's it's that thank you for the
 
02:01:38.750 --> 02:01:38.760 align:start position:0%
question it's actually more of a hybrid
 
02:01:38.760 --> 02:01:40.010 align:start position:0%
question it's actually more of a hybrid
so

02:01:40.010 --> 02:01:40.020 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:01:41.810 --> 02:01:41.820 align:start position:0%
the difference between just individual
 
02:01:43.310 --> 02:01:43.320 align:start position:0%
income tax if you let's say you're
 
02:01:45.470 --> 02:01:45.480 align:start position:0%
working in New Hampshire remotely but
 
02:01:47.030 --> 02:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
it's through a Massachusetts company
 
02:01:51.350 --> 02:01:51.360 align:start position:0%
that scenario is where the individual is
 
02:01:53.450 --> 02:01:53.460 align:start position:0%
working the dividend the distribution
 
02:01:56.510 --> 02:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
payout has to do with the company of the
 
02:01:57.589 --> 02:01:57.599 align:start position:0%
S Corps
 
02:01:59.270 --> 02:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
profit margin and then they're
 
02:02:00.709 --> 02:02:00.719 align:start position:0%
distributing some of those profits
 
02:02:02.870 --> 02:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
making a distribution to its
 
02:02:05.149 --> 02:02:05.159 align:start position:0%
shareholders at a certain time those
 
02:02:07.129 --> 02:02:07.139 align:start position:0%
profits are then those are actually
 
02:02:09.530 --> 02:02:09.540 align:start position:0%
still realized in the other state and
 
02:02:11.990 --> 02:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
that's that's the company the ownership
 
02:02:13.189 --> 02:02:13.199 align:start position:0%
of the company's different than the
 
02:02:14.810 --> 02:02:14.820 align:start position:0%
individual income is that the company
 
02:02:16.850 --> 02:02:16.860 align:start position:0%
operation is still out of state
 
02:02:21.530 --> 02:02:21.540 align:start position:0%
so in that case it to me with this
 
02:02:24.290 --> 02:02:24.300 align:start position:0%
scenario it's the reverse you're being
 
02:02:26.510 --> 02:02:26.520 align:start position:0%
taxed because of where you live but
 
02:02:28.129 --> 02:02:28.139 align:start position:0%
you're also being taxed because where
 
02:02:29.629 --> 02:02:29.639 align:start position:0%
the S Corp is performing you're actually
 
02:02:30.890 --> 02:02:30.900 align:start position:0%
getting both
 
02:02:33.890 --> 02:02:33.900 align:start position:0%
so my whole the whole point of this is
 
02:02:35.990 --> 02:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
that you're getting hit twice where you
 
02:02:37.669 --> 02:02:37.679 align:start position:0%
should only be getting hit once whether
 
02:02:39.229 --> 02:02:39.239 align:start position:0%
whether we agree that that should be
 
02:02:40.910 --> 02:02:40.920 align:start position:0%
paid to New Hampshire or that should be
 
02:02:43.010 --> 02:02:43.020 align:start position:0%
paid to Massachusetts that's a different
 
02:02:44.629 --> 02:02:44.639 align:start position:0%
discussion but you should not be paying
 
02:02:46.550 --> 02:02:46.560 align:start position:0%
both normally what happens is that the
 
02:02:48.589 --> 02:02:48.599 align:start position:0%
states will have a reciprocal agreement
 
02:02:51.350 --> 02:02:51.360 align:start position:0%
but because the states are calling it
 
02:02:52.669 --> 02:02:52.679 align:start position:0%
different they're classifying it
 
02:02:53.990 --> 02:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
differently I'm calling it apple and
 
02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:54.950 align:start position:0%
differently I'm calling it apple and
orange

02:02:54.950 --> 02:02:54.960 align:start position:0%
orange
 
02:02:57.649 --> 02:02:57.659 align:start position:0%
there's not there's no offset
 
02:02:59.629 --> 02:02:59.639 align:start position:0%
so that's the problem there should be a
 
02:03:02.390 --> 02:03:02.400 align:start position:0%
credit and it should go both ways if it
 
02:03:05.450 --> 02:03:05.460 align:start position:0%
was the reverse situation and you're a
 
02:03:07.310 --> 02:03:07.320 align:start position:0%
Incorporated in New Hampshire but you
 
02:03:09.229 --> 02:03:09.239 align:start position:0%
slowly live in Massachusetts they're
 
02:03:10.550 --> 02:03:10.560 align:start position:0%
actually doing the same thing and
 
02:03:12.589 --> 02:03:12.599 align:start position:0%
they're violating it just as bad as the
 
02:03:13.850 --> 02:03:13.860 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire
 
02:03:15.290 --> 02:03:15.300 align:start position:0%
I would say
 
02:03:17.450 --> 02:03:17.460 align:start position:0%
that's something that when you come to
 
02:03:20.089 --> 02:03:20.099 align:start position:0%
those agreements on the on the offset
 
02:03:22.070 --> 02:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
that's usually that's a that's a
 
02:03:23.689 --> 02:03:23.699 align:start position:0%
different conversation to have with the
 
02:03:24.770 --> 02:03:24.780 align:start position:0%
states because sometimes it is
 
02:03:26.870 --> 02:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
disproportionate but
 
02:03:28.850 --> 02:03:28.860 align:start position:0%
that I I would say it's kind of in
 
02:03:29.930 --> 02:03:29.940 align:start position:0%
between the two because you're really
 
02:03:31.370 --> 02:03:31.380 align:start position:0%
getting hit twice so regardless of where
 
02:03:33.649 --> 02:03:33.659 align:start position:0%
you live and where your company is it's
 
02:03:35.330 --> 02:03:35.340 align:start position:0%
both so
 
02:03:38.810 --> 02:03:38.820 align:start position:0%
that's the way I was looking at it
 
02:03:38.820 --> 02:03:40.370 align:start position:0%
that's the way I was looking at it
represents

02:03:40.370 --> 02:03:40.380 align:start position:0%
represents
 
02:03:43.189 --> 02:03:43.199 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman
 
02:03:45.229 --> 02:03:45.239 align:start position:0%
um thank you representative Abbas I
 
02:03:47.209 --> 02:03:47.219 align:start position:0%
think your explanation makes a great
 
02:03:48.950 --> 02:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
deal of sense but I just want to make
 
02:03:51.229 --> 02:03:51.239 align:start position:0%
sure I understand correctly we're not
 
02:03:53.510 --> 02:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
talking about dividends or distributions
 
02:03:56.390 --> 02:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
from companies who may own shares in
 
02:03:58.850 --> 02:03:58.860 align:start position:0%
that are located in other states I think
 
02:04:00.649 --> 02:04:00.659 align:start position:0%
we're talking only about pass-through
 
02:04:04.430 --> 02:04:04.440 align:start position:0%
entities where the business tax goes on
 
02:04:07.129 --> 02:04:07.139 align:start position:0%
the personal return uh in other words
 
02:04:11.330 --> 02:04:11.340 align:start position:0%
Partnerships sub chapter S uh and llc's
 
02:04:13.850 --> 02:04:13.860 align:start position:0%
am I correct in making that distinction
 
02:04:16.609 --> 02:04:16.619 align:start position:0%
so when I answer you when we answer this
 
02:04:18.410 --> 02:04:18.420 align:start position:0%
and just say that I am not a tax expert
 
02:04:20.450 --> 02:04:20.460 align:start position:0%
I I don't practice tax law I'm not a
 
02:04:23.629 --> 02:04:23.639 align:start position:0%
certified CPA so when I look at I'm
 
02:04:26.089 --> 02:04:26.099 align:start position:0%
talking mostly with dividends paid
 
02:04:27.709 --> 02:04:27.719 align:start position:0%
through an S corporation
 
02:04:30.290 --> 02:04:30.300 align:start position:0%
and when I look at that that's what's
 
02:04:32.390 --> 02:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
getting to me I'm is being taxed twice
 
02:04:33.830 --> 02:04:33.840 align:start position:0%
the business profits tax my
 
02:04:37.129 --> 02:04:37.139 align:start position:0%
understanding is is not
 
02:04:39.950 --> 02:04:39.960 align:start position:0%
oh it's not the same situation that if
 
02:04:41.870 --> 02:04:41.880 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong about that then it it would
 
02:04:43.070 --> 02:04:43.080 align:start position:0%
still be I still would think that's
 
02:04:44.570 --> 02:04:44.580 align:start position:0%
violating that the Commerce Clause too
 
02:04:47.570 --> 02:04:47.580 align:start position:0%
but I'm looking at this is where the
 
02:04:48.770 --> 02:04:48.780 align:start position:0%
person's working in Massachusetts
 
02:04:51.169 --> 02:04:51.179 align:start position:0%
they're not contesting that they should
 
02:04:53.209 --> 02:04:53.219 align:start position:0%
be taxing to Massachusetts they're just
 
02:04:55.370 --> 02:04:55.380 align:start position:0%
everything's done there they just simply
 
02:04:58.790 --> 02:04:58.800 align:start position:0%
reside here and by living here you're
 
02:05:01.790 --> 02:05:01.800 align:start position:0%
being taxed a dividends tax that's
 
02:05:04.250 --> 02:05:04.260 align:start position:0%
already been taxed in Massachusetts
 
02:05:05.990 --> 02:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
whether it's but it's whether it's an
 
02:05:08.810 --> 02:05:08.820 align:start position:0%
LLC or a partnership it would be the
 
02:05:11.149 --> 02:05:11.159 align:start position:0%
same principle being violated it just
 
02:05:13.490 --> 02:05:13.500 align:start position:0%
it's just another analogy to be made but
 
02:05:14.990 --> 02:05:15.000 align:start position:0%
I think there I would put all those in
 
02:05:16.850 --> 02:05:16.860 align:start position:0%
the same category but this is where it's
 
02:05:18.169 --> 02:05:18.179 align:start position:0%
happening the most
 
02:05:20.510 --> 02:05:20.520 align:start position:0%
so so just to clarify the way I'm
 
02:05:22.310 --> 02:05:22.320 align:start position:0%
understanding your answer
 
02:05:25.609 --> 02:05:25.619 align:start position:0%
I don't believe this is applies to a
 
02:05:28.790 --> 02:05:28.800 align:start position:0%
situation where a C corporation exists
 
02:05:31.430 --> 02:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
in another state and Massachusetts does
 
02:05:34.970 --> 02:05:34.980 align:start position:0%
not purport to apply attacks on a
 
02:05:37.070 --> 02:05:37.080 align:start position:0%
dividend sent to a resident of New
 
02:05:40.250 --> 02:05:40.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it applies in the case of tax
 
02:05:42.890 --> 02:05:42.900 align:start position:0%
uh pass-through entities where the
 
02:05:44.689 --> 02:05:44.699 align:start position:0%
individual receiving the dividend or
 
02:05:46.729 --> 02:05:46.739 align:start position:0%
distribution is actually the person
 
02:05:48.169 --> 02:05:48.179 align:start position:0%
receiving the profit on the
 
02:05:49.810 --> 02:05:49.820 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts company
 
02:05:55.850 --> 02:05:55.860 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:55.860 --> 02:06:01.129 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:06:01.129 --> 02:06:01.139 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:05.810 --> 02:06:05.820 align:start position:0%
on president of Abbas on
 
02:06:08.510 --> 02:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
it's I'm wondering
 
02:06:12.550 --> 02:06:12.560 align:start position:0%
on if you're you're asking us to
 
02:06:15.890 --> 02:06:15.900 align:start position:0%
unilaterally on
 
02:06:18.589 --> 02:06:18.599 align:start position:0%
remove ourselves from taxing anything
 
02:06:22.550 --> 02:06:22.560 align:start position:0%
that Massachusetts is taxing it sounds
 
02:06:24.950 --> 02:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
like to me because we can't get
 
02:06:27.410 --> 02:06:27.420 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts to do agreements with us
 
02:06:30.830 --> 02:06:30.840 align:start position:0%
as far as I can tell on do you realize
 
02:06:34.189 --> 02:06:34.199 align:start position:0%
that if we have lower taxes at the state
 
02:06:37.490 --> 02:06:37.500 align:start position:0%
level here your property tax is going up
 
02:06:38.930 --> 02:06:38.940 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:06:41.450 --> 02:06:41.460 align:start position:0%
well just to thank you for the question
 
02:06:42.950 --> 02:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
first of all I think that's an
 
02:06:44.750 --> 02:06:44.760 align:start position:0%
assumption that the property taxes go up
 
02:06:48.649 --> 02:06:48.659 align:start position:0%
and to make a grand over broad statement
 
02:06:51.350 --> 02:06:51.360 align:start position:0%
about how the local governments will
 
02:06:53.570 --> 02:06:53.580 align:start position:0%
change their tax rates and I I think
 
02:06:55.430 --> 02:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
that's that's over that's too broad of a
 
02:06:56.570 --> 02:06:56.580 align:start position:0%
statement to make
 
02:07:00.169 --> 02:07:00.179 align:start position:0%
and I what I'm referring to here is
 
02:07:02.030 --> 02:07:02.040 align:start position:0%
this is something the Supreme Court has
 
02:07:04.850 --> 02:07:04.860 align:start position:0%
decided whether I like it or not is not
 
02:07:06.770 --> 02:07:06.780 align:start position:0%
it's that's I can have my own personal
 
02:07:08.810 --> 02:07:08.820 align:start position:0%
opinion on it but I just look at the
 
02:07:11.030 --> 02:07:11.040 align:start position:0%
this is something that they've ruled on
 
02:07:12.950 --> 02:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
several times saying a double taxation
 
02:07:15.410 --> 02:07:15.420 align:start position:0%
is inappropriate and just just like any
 
02:07:17.750 --> 02:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
other presidents I'm looking at it and I
 
02:07:20.750 --> 02:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
see it happening and I'll be honest if I
 
02:07:22.729 --> 02:07:22.739 align:start position:0%
was the plaintiff or if I was hit with
 
02:07:24.169 --> 02:07:24.179 align:start position:0%
this I would challenge it and I would
 
02:07:25.729 --> 02:07:25.739 align:start position:0%
say well I'm not sure that you're
 
02:07:28.310 --> 02:07:28.320 align:start position:0%
allowed to do this so that would cost
 
02:07:29.689 --> 02:07:29.699 align:start position:0%
the state a lot of money having to
 
02:07:32.570 --> 02:07:32.580 align:start position:0%
refund all that money and when it comes
 
02:07:35.450 --> 02:07:35.460 align:start position:0%
to property taxes if if there was
 
02:07:36.890 --> 02:07:36.900 align:start position:0%
there's already a lot of great
 
02:07:38.570 --> 02:07:38.580 align:start position:0%
incentives to live in New Hampshire and
 
02:07:40.070 --> 02:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
it's I it's one of the I would say the
 
02:07:42.050 --> 02:07:42.060 align:start position:0%
best state to live in the entire country
 
02:07:44.450 --> 02:07:44.460 align:start position:0%
but there are people that would make the
 
02:07:46.250 --> 02:07:46.260 align:start position:0%
financial decision to not live here for
 
02:07:48.649 --> 02:07:48.659 align:start position:0%
that reason simply to avoid this double
 
02:07:48.659 --> 02:07:49.850 align:start position:0%
that reason simply to avoid this double
taxation

02:07:49.850 --> 02:07:49.860 align:start position:0%
taxation
 
02:07:53.510 --> 02:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
I would believe that this would create a
 
02:07:56.089 --> 02:07:56.099 align:start position:0%
more of an incentive to move here which
 
02:07:58.310 --> 02:07:58.320 align:start position:0%
would perhaps develop more areas which
 
02:08:00.530 --> 02:08:00.540 align:start position:0%
would create more revenue and property
 
02:08:02.570 --> 02:08:02.580 align:start position:0%
taxes just by developing more homes but
 
02:08:04.669 --> 02:08:04.679 align:start position:0%
it would also improve the economic
 
02:08:06.709 --> 02:08:06.719 align:start position:0%
activity in the area where you have
 
02:08:09.050 --> 02:08:09.060 align:start position:0%
people who perceivably have disposal
 
02:08:10.430 --> 02:08:10.440 align:start position:0%
income to spend to support local
 
02:08:13.729 --> 02:08:13.739 align:start position:0%
businesses there will be a lot of domino
 
02:08:16.970 --> 02:08:16.980 align:start position:0%
effects of actually having uh getting
 
02:08:18.350 --> 02:08:18.360 align:start position:0%
rid of this it's just not it's not
 
02:08:19.669 --> 02:08:19.679 align:start position:0%
simply black and white like this so I
 
02:08:21.530 --> 02:08:21.540 align:start position:0%
don't actually agree that real estate
 
02:08:24.050 --> 02:08:24.060 align:start position:0%
taxes would go up especially along the
 
02:08:25.970 --> 02:08:25.980 align:start position:0%
bordering parts of the state but I also
 
02:08:29.810 --> 02:08:29.820 align:start position:0%
believe that it is still a policy that's
 
02:08:32.089 --> 02:08:32.099 align:start position:0%
really it's negatively impacting a lot
 
02:08:35.209 --> 02:08:35.219 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:35.219 --> 02:08:36.589 align:start position:0%
 
sure

02:08:36.589 --> 02:08:36.599 align:start position:0%
sure
 
02:08:40.689 --> 02:08:40.699 align:start position:0%
any further questions Mr chair
 
02:08:40.699 --> 02:08:42.649 align:start position:0%
any further questions Mr chair
representative

02:08:42.649 --> 02:08:42.659 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:08:45.050 --> 02:08:45.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr a question for you
 
02:08:47.930 --> 02:08:47.940 align:start position:0%
will we see a fiscal note come on this
 
02:08:50.030 --> 02:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
from someone
 
02:08:53.450 --> 02:08:53.460 align:start position:0%
we have two other people signed up to
 
02:08:56.689 --> 02:08:56.699 align:start position:0%
testify one from the pi all right
 
02:09:00.229 --> 02:09:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:02.209 --> 02:09:02.219 align:start position:0%
for the questions
 
02:09:07.250 --> 02:09:07.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:11.870 --> 02:09:11.880 align:start position:0%
I will go to Eric Blackburn and thank
 
02:09:16.910 --> 02:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:18.950 --> 02:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
oh okay I'm sorry
 
02:09:18.960 --> 02:09:20.209 align:start position:0%
oh okay I'm sorry
and

02:09:20.209 --> 02:09:20.219 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:09:24.609 --> 02:09:24.619 align:start position:0%
we're going down here
 
02:09:31.189 --> 02:09:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:35.030 --> 02:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
Carol good morning Mr chair members of
 
02:09:37.189 --> 02:09:37.199 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Carolyn Lear
 
02:09:39.350 --> 02:09:39.360 align:start position:0%
and I'm the assistant commissioner at
 
02:09:41.870 --> 02:09:41.880 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Department of Revenue
 
02:09:44.510 --> 02:09:44.520 align:start position:0%
um and I think representative of Abbas
 
02:09:47.149 --> 02:09:47.159 align:start position:0%
did a really nice job of really framing
 
02:09:50.390 --> 02:09:50.400 align:start position:0%
this issue for you all
 
02:09:53.510 --> 02:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
um I took his testimony to really frame
 
02:09:56.330 --> 02:09:56.340 align:start position:0%
this as a two-part issue for you to
 
02:10:00.830 --> 02:10:00.840 align:start position:0%
consider one would you consider whether
 
02:10:03.649 --> 02:10:03.659 align:start position:0%
to amend the interest in dividends tax
 
02:10:07.010 --> 02:10:07.020 align:start position:0%
statute because of constitutionality
 
02:10:10.430 --> 02:10:10.440 align:start position:0%
concerns and the other is for you to
 
02:10:14.510 --> 02:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
amend the statute based on um sort of a
 
02:10:17.629 --> 02:10:17.639 align:start position:0%
policy uh policy-based cost benefit
 
02:10:21.589 --> 02:10:21.599 align:start position:0%
analysis is this good for New Hampshire
 
02:10:23.689 --> 02:10:23.699 align:start position:0%
um and I would like to address both of
 
02:10:27.109 --> 02:10:27.119 align:start position:0%
those sort of issues in turn
 
02:10:31.430 --> 02:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
so relative to the constitutionality of
 
02:10:34.010 --> 02:10:34.020 align:start position:0%
how um New Hampshire
 
02:10:37.729 --> 02:10:37.739 align:start position:0%
taxes um the pass-through income of
 
02:10:42.109 --> 02:10:42.119 align:start position:0%
Resident S corporation shareholders I
 
02:10:42.119 --> 02:10:43.189 align:start position:0%
Resident S corporation shareholders I
think

02:10:43.189 --> 02:10:43.199 align:start position:0%
think
 
02:10:46.850 --> 02:10:46.860 align:start position:0%
all I would caution you with is this
 
02:10:49.990 --> 02:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
idea of conceding the
 
02:10:53.030 --> 02:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
unconstitutionality of the statute
 
02:10:55.750 --> 02:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
um I think if we were to
 
02:11:00.470 --> 02:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
get this as a lawsuit we would say that
 
02:11:02.870 --> 02:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
it is not unconstitutional
 
02:11:05.930 --> 02:11:05.940 align:start position:0%
um the reason being that
 
02:11:07.870 --> 02:11:07.880 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire and Massachusetts
 
02:11:10.609 --> 02:11:10.619 align:start position:0%
really has a functionally different
 
02:11:15.350 --> 02:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
method of taxing both individuals and
 
02:11:15.360 --> 02:11:17.390 align:start position:0%
method of taxing both individuals and
businesses

02:11:17.390 --> 02:11:17.400 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
02:11:19.430 --> 02:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
um in Massachusetts as everyone
 
02:11:22.810 --> 02:11:22.820 align:start position:0%
correctly heard if you're a corporation
 
02:11:27.530 --> 02:11:27.540 align:start position:0%
you will pay income tax at the corporate
 
02:11:27.540 --> 02:11:28.550 align:start position:0%
you will pay income tax at the corporate
level

02:11:28.550 --> 02:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
level
 
02:11:31.189 --> 02:11:31.199 align:start position:0%
and then if the shareholders receive
 
02:11:34.370 --> 02:11:34.380 align:start position:0%
income from that Corporation
 
02:11:38.030 --> 02:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
um they will also pay income tax on
 
02:11:39.709 --> 02:11:39.719 align:start position:0%
those distributions
 
02:11:42.530 --> 02:11:42.540 align:start position:0%
somewhat different in Massachusetts is
 
02:11:45.830 --> 02:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
that an S corporation doesn't pay tax at
 
02:11:48.890 --> 02:11:48.900 align:start position:0%
the entity level those profits just get
 
02:11:50.629 --> 02:11:50.639 align:start position:0%
sent right down to their shareholders
 
02:11:53.629 --> 02:11:53.639 align:start position:0%
and as representative Abbas mentioned
 
02:11:55.189 --> 02:11:55.199 align:start position:0%
our tax
 
02:11:57.410 --> 02:11:57.420 align:start position:0%
if those shareholders
 
02:12:01.370 --> 02:12:01.380 align:start position:0%
um are in New Hampshire we then look to
 
02:12:04.669 --> 02:12:04.679 align:start position:0%
those shareholders for IND tax and
 
02:12:06.530 --> 02:12:06.540 align:start position:0%
that's very similar to what we would do
 
02:12:09.589 --> 02:12:09.599 align:start position:0%
to a shareholder of a C Corp or a
 
02:12:11.870 --> 02:12:11.880 align:start position:0%
partner in a partnership
 
02:12:13.609 --> 02:12:13.619 align:start position:0%
um so for that reason we would just
 
02:12:16.070 --> 02:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
caution on just conceding that
 
02:12:18.350 --> 02:12:18.360 align:start position:0%
constitutional issue I think we might
 
02:12:20.089 --> 02:12:20.099 align:start position:0%
want to assert
 
02:12:22.550 --> 02:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
um that the IND tax is just different
 
02:12:25.490 --> 02:12:25.500 align:start position:0%
from what Massachusetts is doing and
 
02:12:27.890 --> 02:12:27.900 align:start position:0%
perhaps consistent with our overall
 
02:12:32.149 --> 02:12:32.159 align:start position:0%
scheme of how we tax interest
 
02:12:34.729 --> 02:12:34.739 align:start position:0%
um of individuals and tax businesses at
 
02:12:36.410 --> 02:12:36.420 align:start position:0%
the entity level
 
02:12:38.709 --> 02:12:38.719 align:start position:0%
moving on to sort of the more
 
02:12:41.570 --> 02:12:41.580 align:start position:0%
policy-based reason why you might want
 
02:12:41.580 --> 02:12:42.890 align:start position:0%
policy-based reason why you might want
to

02:12:42.890 --> 02:12:42.900 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:12:45.890 --> 02:12:45.900 align:start position:0%
um consider this bill as you might
 
02:12:47.510 --> 02:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
expect we don't really take a position
 
02:12:50.689 --> 02:12:50.699 align:start position:0%
on that I think that's for you folks to
 
02:12:50.699 --> 02:12:52.010 align:start position:0%
on that I think that's for you folks to
really

02:12:52.010 --> 02:12:52.020 align:start position:0%
really
 
02:12:54.470 --> 02:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
um evaluate and decide I know there was
 
02:12:57.069 --> 02:12:57.079 align:start position:0%
some interest earlier in the potential
 
02:13:01.010 --> 02:13:01.020 align:start position:0%
impact of this legislation we were not
 
02:13:03.950 --> 02:13:03.960 align:start position:0%
asked to do a fiscal note for this
 
02:13:05.930 --> 02:13:05.940 align:start position:0%
legislation and I'm not sure that we
 
02:13:08.870 --> 02:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
would have the data to come up with a
 
02:13:08.880 --> 02:13:09.709 align:start position:0%
would have the data to come up with a
good

02:13:09.709 --> 02:13:09.719 align:start position:0%
good
 
02:13:13.370 --> 02:13:13.380 align:start position:0%
um fiscal note for this bill but um I
 
02:13:15.470 --> 02:13:15.480 align:start position:0%
would suspect
 
02:13:17.629 --> 02:13:17.639 align:start position:0%
um that it would have a fiscal impact
 
02:13:20.450 --> 02:13:20.460 align:start position:0%
simply be because of the cross-border
 
02:13:23.330 --> 02:13:23.340 align:start position:0%
nature of a lot of shareholders in New
 
02:13:26.569 --> 02:13:26.579 align:start position:0%
Hampshire who live in New Hampshire but
 
02:13:29.209 --> 02:13:29.219 align:start position:0%
own an interest in an entity that's in
 
02:13:32.750 --> 02:13:32.760 align:start position:0%
Maine or Massachusetts or Vermont
 
02:13:35.689 --> 02:13:35.699 align:start position:0%
um where there are income taxes
 
02:13:37.490 --> 02:13:37.500 align:start position:0%
um so it could have a fiscal impact and
 
02:13:39.709 --> 02:13:39.719 align:start position:0%
I think that's really not my prerogative
 
02:13:42.830 --> 02:13:42.840 align:start position:0%
to sort of weigh in on whether
 
02:13:47.330 --> 02:13:47.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:49.490 --> 02:13:49.500 align:start position:0%
otherwise I am happy to answer any
 
02:13:55.330 --> 02:13:55.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:02.089 --> 02:14:02.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:04.550 --> 02:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
and it's later how are you good how are
 
02:14:05.870 --> 02:14:05.880 align:start position:0%
you good
 
02:14:08.030 --> 02:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
so as I mentioned earlier this issue
 
02:14:10.129 --> 02:14:10.139 align:start position:0%
came up uh probably seven or eight years
 
02:14:10.139 --> 02:14:11.810 align:start position:0%
came up uh probably seven or eight years
ago

02:14:11.810 --> 02:14:11.820 align:start position:0%
ago
 
02:14:13.850 --> 02:14:13.860 align:start position:0%
um and it came up even before then there
 
02:14:15.589 --> 02:14:15.599 align:start position:0%
was a commission to look at all our
 
02:14:15.599 --> 02:14:17.450 align:start position:0%
was a commission to look at all our
taxes

02:14:17.450 --> 02:14:17.460 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
02:14:21.169 --> 02:14:21.179 align:start position:0%
um maybe representative major and uh I
 
02:14:22.370 --> 02:14:22.380 align:start position:0%
don't remember this
 
02:14:25.370 --> 02:14:25.380 align:start position:0%
and it was identified that this was one
 
02:14:27.229 --> 02:14:27.239 align:start position:0%
of our more quirky
 
02:14:30.709 --> 02:14:30.719 align:start position:0%
kind of thing of the way we
 
02:14:33.830 --> 02:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
tax businesses I remember that word
 
02:14:39.229 --> 02:14:39.239 align:start position:0%
clearly was quirky uh and uh but at that
 
02:14:42.229 --> 02:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
time when this became a bill there was a
 
02:14:44.750 --> 02:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
bill that we dealt with we did get some
 
02:14:46.850 --> 02:14:46.860 align:start position:0%
estimates of revenues
 
02:14:50.109 --> 02:14:50.119 align:start position:0%
uh maybe it was a rough estimate
 
02:14:53.270 --> 02:14:53.280 align:start position:0%
because that's what made the committee
 
02:14:56.030 --> 02:14:56.040 align:start position:0%
shy away from doing anything about this
 
02:14:56.040 --> 02:14:57.229 align:start position:0%
shy away from doing anything about this
because

02:14:57.229 --> 02:14:57.239 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:15:00.890 --> 02:15:00.900 align:start position:0%
it was it was it appeared that there'd
 
02:15:02.629 --> 02:15:02.639 align:start position:0%
be a lot of loss Revenue to the state at
 
02:15:04.970 --> 02:15:04.980 align:start position:0%
a time where we couldn't afford that
 
02:15:07.550 --> 02:15:07.560 align:start position:0%
lost Revenue now obviously
 
02:15:10.189 --> 02:15:10.199 align:start position:0%
I was I would have been in a beneficiary
 
02:15:13.669 --> 02:15:13.679 align:start position:0%
of this bill that you know this type of
 
02:15:15.850 --> 02:15:15.860 align:start position:0%
Bill passing when I was still working
 
02:15:20.990 --> 02:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
I'm retired now so uh but um so is there
 
02:15:23.750 --> 02:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
any way possible that we can
 
02:15:26.270 --> 02:15:26.280 align:start position:0%
get at least a rough estimate of somehow
 
02:15:28.790 --> 02:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
fiscal of a fiscal amount on this
 
02:15:30.950 --> 02:15:30.960 align:start position:0%
I could take that back to
 
02:15:33.589 --> 02:15:33.599 align:start position:0%
um our financial analysts and see what
 
02:15:36.050 --> 02:15:36.060 align:start position:0%
they could come up with
 
02:15:38.050 --> 02:15:38.060 align:start position:0%
um perhaps we could
 
02:15:39.950 --> 02:15:39.960 align:start position:0%
cross-reference if there's any
 
02:15:42.109 --> 02:15:42.119 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts or federal data available
 
02:15:44.450 --> 02:15:44.460 align:start position:0%
that might help us hone in on a rough
 
02:15:46.729 --> 02:15:46.739 align:start position:0%
estimate right okay I appreciate
 
02:15:56.810 --> 02:15:56.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:58.069 --> 02:15:58.079 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:15:58.079 --> 02:16:07.689 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

02:16:07.689 --> 02:16:07.699 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:12.350 --> 02:16:12.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:12.360 --> 02:16:16.189 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:16:16.189 --> 02:16:16.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:18.950 --> 02:16:18.960 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
02:16:22.669 --> 02:16:22.679 align:start position:0%
um yeah my question goes to the uh Point
 
02:16:24.589 --> 02:16:24.599 align:start position:0%
made by representative abrami the
 
02:16:27.470 --> 02:16:27.480 align:start position:0%
question or request for a fiscal note I
 
02:16:29.209 --> 02:16:29.219 align:start position:0%
think we really need to have a fiscal
 
02:16:31.729 --> 02:16:31.739 align:start position:0%
note I understand it may be difficult
 
02:16:33.650 --> 02:16:33.660 align:start position:0%
all fiscal notes in fact have
 
02:16:38.030 --> 02:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
difficulties uh and uh we get uh in the
 
02:16:41.570 --> 02:16:41.580 align:start position:0%
course of dra doing a fiscal note we get
 
02:16:44.209 --> 02:16:44.219 align:start position:0%
a good explanation of what the bill in
 
02:16:47.810 --> 02:16:47.820 align:start position:0%
fact uh as they understand it would
 
02:16:50.209 --> 02:16:50.219 align:start position:0%
would do and I think we really need that
 
02:16:52.310 --> 02:16:52.320 align:start position:0%
in this case because there was uh
 
02:16:55.250 --> 02:16:55.260 align:start position:0%
confusion I think amongst those who are
 
02:16:58.849 --> 02:16:58.859 align:start position:0%
asking questions and uh and the answers
 
02:16:58.859 --> 02:16:59.990 align:start position:0%
asking questions and uh and the answers
given

02:16:59.990 --> 02:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
given
 
02:17:02.209 --> 02:17:02.219 align:start position:0%
um and it left me wondering scratching
 
02:17:05.690 --> 02:17:05.700 align:start position:0%
my head exactly what is the uh situation
 
02:17:09.230 --> 02:17:09.240 align:start position:0%
that's of concern so I really hope that
 
02:17:12.950 --> 02:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
we can get a uh fiscal note from dra
 
02:17:15.169 --> 02:17:15.179 align:start position:0%
that explains their understanding of the
 
02:17:17.270 --> 02:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
bill and then
 
02:17:21.169 --> 02:17:21.179 align:start position:0%
um their identification if they can't do
 
02:17:23.750 --> 02:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
a bottom line estimate of the factors
 
02:17:25.790 --> 02:17:25.800 align:start position:0%
the cost factors
 
02:17:28.969 --> 02:17:28.979 align:start position:0%
that go both ways that would weigh into
 
02:17:34.070 --> 02:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
the impact so that's my uh it's really a
 
02:17:38.209 --> 02:17:38.219 align:start position:0%
request to era
 
02:17:38.219 --> 02:17:40.629 align:start position:0%
request to era
representative

02:17:40.629 --> 02:17:40.639 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:17:44.750 --> 02:17:44.760 align:start position:0%
uh yeah another question uh Slayer uh
 
02:17:47.629 --> 02:17:47.639 align:start position:0%
could you help us out and and direct us
 
02:17:51.169 --> 02:17:51.179 align:start position:0%
to exactly where in the statutes
 
02:17:54.770 --> 02:17:54.780 align:start position:0%
uh we should be looking for can you find
 
02:17:56.629 --> 02:17:56.639 align:start position:0%
a line in the in the statute current
 
02:17:58.070 --> 02:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
statutes that
 
02:18:00.709 --> 02:18:00.719 align:start position:0%
make these out of state distributions
 
02:18:00.719 --> 02:18:03.049 align:start position:0%
make these out of state distributions
taxable

02:18:03.049 --> 02:18:03.059 align:start position:0%
taxable
 
02:18:15.969 --> 02:18:15.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:18.530 --> 02:18:18.540 align:start position:0%
so as not to
 
02:18:18.540 --> 02:18:20.270 align:start position:0%
so as not to
um

02:18:20.270 --> 02:18:20.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:21.889 --> 02:18:21.899 align:start position:0%
waste your time
 
02:18:25.030 --> 02:18:25.040 align:start position:0%
perhaps I could follow up in an email
 
02:18:28.190 --> 02:18:28.200 align:start position:0%
with identification of the exact
 
02:18:30.549 --> 02:18:30.559 align:start position:0%
Provisions as I try to pull them up
 
02:18:33.169 --> 02:18:33.179 align:start position:0%
that's what I was requesting okay sure
 
02:18:36.230 --> 02:18:36.240 align:start position:0%
absolutely sorry I misunderstood oh no
 
02:18:37.730 --> 02:18:37.740 align:start position:0%
no I don't want you I haven't scrambled
 
02:18:39.410 --> 02:18:39.420 align:start position:0%
now to do that thank you perfect it'll
 
02:18:40.310 --> 02:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
be helpful
 
02:18:45.530 --> 02:18:45.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:50.270 --> 02:18:50.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman on Carolyn can we
 
02:18:53.690 --> 02:18:53.700 align:start position:0%
is there some way that we could get
 
02:18:53.700 --> 02:18:55.969 align:start position:0%
is there some way that we could get
um a

02:18:55.969 --> 02:18:55.979 align:start position:0%
um a
 
02:18:58.790 --> 02:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
history for the last 10 years or more of
 
02:19:04.490 --> 02:19:04.500 align:start position:0%
of uh the number of high income uh pairs
 
02:19:08.509 --> 02:19:08.519 align:start position:0%
of the IND that have uh disappeared I
 
02:19:09.950 --> 02:19:09.960 align:start position:0%
know some of them will have disappeared
 
02:19:12.190 --> 02:19:12.200 align:start position:0%
simply because they died
 
02:19:18.049 --> 02:19:18.059 align:start position:0%
but we've had both I think this Bill and
 
02:19:19.129 --> 02:19:19.139 align:start position:0%
for it
 
02:19:20.690 --> 02:19:20.700 align:start position:0%
talk about high-end High income people
 
02:19:22.870 --> 02:19:22.880 align:start position:0%
leaving the state because of this tax
 
02:19:26.929 --> 02:19:26.939 align:start position:0%
and my remembrance of what the state
 
02:19:29.209 --> 02:19:29.219 align:start position:0%
demographer has been telling us the last
 
02:19:32.209 --> 02:19:32.219 align:start position:0%
couple of times is that we have more
 
02:19:34.610 --> 02:19:34.620 align:start position:0%
low-income people leaving and high
 
02:19:36.889 --> 02:19:36.899 align:start position:0%
income people coming in
 
02:19:44.450 --> 02:19:44.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:49.070 --> 02:19:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:52.010 --> 02:19:52.020 align:start position:0%
anybody else wish to testify for against
 
02:19:59.870 --> 02:19:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:04.310 --> 02:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
huh say I'm not then I pause the public
 
02:20:24.530 --> 02:20:24.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:27.410 --> 02:20:27.420 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman yes
 
02:20:30.349 --> 02:20:30.359 align:start position:0%
could I just ask there was another bill
 
02:20:34.010 --> 02:20:34.020 align:start position:0%
that on we were trying to get a fiscal
 
02:20:36.250 --> 02:20:36.260 align:start position:0%
note on
 
02:20:38.990 --> 02:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
and I'm trying to remember which number
 
02:20:41.330 --> 02:20:41.340 align:start position:0%
it is now
 
02:20:45.230 --> 02:20:45.240 align:start position:0%
um but that on they told us that we'd
 
02:20:47.929 --> 02:20:47.939 align:start position:0%
have to do a vote in committee
 
02:20:50.450 --> 02:20:50.460 align:start position:0%
in order to ask for one
 
02:20:54.610 --> 02:20:54.620 align:start position:0%
oh it was the uh 346.
 
02:20:57.050 --> 02:20:57.060 align:start position:0%
funding source for domestic violence
 
02:20:57.060 --> 02:21:03.670 align:start position:0%
funding source for domestic violence

02:21:03.670 --> 02:21:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:06.290 --> 02:21:06.300 align:start position:0%
that's not for today
 
02:21:09.349 --> 02:21:09.359 align:start position:0%
no it's not until the 17th but it takes
 
02:21:10.969 --> 02:21:10.979 align:start position:0%
a while to get those fiscal notes
 
02:21:10.979 --> 02:21:18.640 align:start position:0%
a while to get those fiscal notes
sometimes

02:21:18.640 --> 02:21:18.650 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:18.650 --> 02:21:21.730 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
02:21:24.830 --> 02:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
on if I remember correctly you told me
 
02:21:26.750 --> 02:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
that they said we had to do a vote in
 
02:21:29.510 --> 02:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
Committee in order to ask for one and I
 
02:21:31.490 --> 02:21:31.500 align:start position:0%
remember that from previous rules too
 
02:21:33.349 --> 02:21:33.359 align:start position:0%
we've never done it
 
02:21:35.389 --> 02:21:35.399 align:start position:0%
but we've never had this many bills
 
02:21:37.429 --> 02:21:37.439 align:start position:0%
without fiscal notes that should have
 
02:21:40.670 --> 02:21:40.680 align:start position:0%
had them HB 102 also should have a
 
02:21:43.370 --> 02:21:43.380 align:start position:0%
fiscal note but on
 
02:21:46.730 --> 02:21:46.740 align:start position:0%
I don't think that the sponsor expects
 
02:21:52.730 --> 02:21:52.740 align:start position:0%
it to to go ahead as an actual bill but
 
02:21:55.190 --> 02:21:55.200 align:start position:0%
as a retained study
 
02:21:59.620 --> 02:21:59.630 align:start position:0%

04:01:15.429 --> 04:01:15.439 align:start position:0%
one of our uh former speakers
 
04:01:18.290 --> 04:01:18.300 align:start position:0%
uh bills I mean when he passed away I
 
04:01:19.610 --> 04:01:19.620 align:start position:0%
took over
 
04:01:21.590 --> 04:01:21.600 align:start position:0%
it uh
 
04:01:24.170 --> 04:01:24.180 align:start position:0%
I'm sure all of you have read it pretty
 
04:01:24.180 --> 04:01:25.429 align:start position:0%
I'm sure all of you have read it pretty
simple

04:01:25.429 --> 04:01:25.439 align:start position:0%
simple
 
04:01:28.790 --> 04:01:28.800 align:start position:0%
it reduces the business profit stacks
 
04:01:30.710 --> 04:01:30.720 align:start position:0%
and the business Enterprise tax
 
04:01:33.710 --> 04:01:33.720 align:start position:0%
until we get down to 7.5 percent for the
 
04:01:35.269 --> 04:01:35.279 align:start position:0%
business profit
 
04:01:38.689 --> 04:01:38.699 align:start position:0%
and point five percent for the
 
04:01:38.699 --> 04:01:41.150 align:start position:0%
and point five percent for the
business

04:01:41.150 --> 04:01:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:45.050 --> 04:01:45.060 align:start position:0%
that's what it says okay thank you
 
04:01:46.670 --> 04:01:46.680 align:start position:0%
you're probably only either going to
 
04:01:48.950 --> 04:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
agree with it or disagree with it but
 
04:01:51.160 --> 04:01:51.170 align:start position:0%
that's that's the whole context
 
04:01:51.170 --> 04:01:52.330 align:start position:0%
that's that's the whole context
[Music]

04:01:52.330 --> 04:01:52.340 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:01:57.070 --> 04:01:57.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:59.750 --> 04:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
04:02:01.550 --> 04:02:01.560 align:start position:0%
representative Packard for making the
 
04:02:01.560 --> 04:02:03.229 align:start position:0%
representative Packard for making the
presentation

04:02:03.229 --> 04:02:03.239 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
04:02:05.510 --> 04:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
at least a simple bill here I I do have
 
04:02:07.010 --> 04:02:07.020 align:start position:0%
a question
 
04:02:10.550 --> 04:02:10.560 align:start position:0%
uh do you have any uh data that shows of
 
04:02:13.969 --> 04:02:13.979 align:start position:0%
a tax rate reduction in the BPT or the
 
04:02:17.150 --> 04:02:17.160 align:start position:0%
BET as proposed by this bill would have
 
04:02:19.790 --> 04:02:19.800 align:start position:0%
a positive impact
 
04:02:23.990 --> 04:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:26.090 --> 04:02:26.100 align:start position:0%
well I mean being from purple you honest
 
04:02:28.130 --> 04:02:28.140 align:start position:0%
we're not 100 sure we'll have a positive
 
04:02:30.170 --> 04:02:30.180 align:start position:0%
impact but we do know that when you
 
04:02:32.389 --> 04:02:32.399 align:start position:0%
reduce taxes it has a positive impact on
 
04:02:35.450 --> 04:02:35.460 align:start position:0%
business and uh business Enterprise and
 
04:02:37.969 --> 04:02:37.979 align:start position:0%
the money that extra the business extra
 
04:02:40.490 --> 04:02:40.500 align:start position:0%
money that they have to spend so we
 
04:02:42.349 --> 04:02:42.359 align:start position:0%
believe it's an absolute positive move
 
04:02:44.450 --> 04:02:44.460 align:start position:0%
forward that will bring more business
 
04:02:47.210 --> 04:02:47.220 align:start position:0%
into the state it will help businesses
 
04:02:50.990 --> 04:02:51.000 align:start position:0%
in the state stay in business and uh
 
04:02:53.570 --> 04:02:53.580 align:start position:0%
help them expand once we get out of this
 
04:02:56.630 --> 04:02:56.640 align:start position:0%
pandem thank you representative uh any
 
04:02:58.130 --> 04:02:58.140 align:start position:0%

problem in our rsas which has been there
 
04:03:22.550 --> 04:03:22.560 align:start position:0%
since you started cutting the business
 
04:03:27.830 --> 04:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
taxes on that I just realized on in both
 
04:03:33.590 --> 04:03:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:36.950 --> 04:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
we just lost our audio you muted
 
04:03:38.750 --> 04:03:38.760 align:start position:0%
yourself accidentally
 
04:03:47.349 --> 04:03:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:52.010 --> 04:03:52.020 align:start position:0%

where I started but on I want to read
 
04:03:58.859 --> 04:04:00.130 align:start position:0%
where I started but on I want to read
from

04:04:00.130 --> 04:04:00.140 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:04:03.610 --> 04:04:03.620 align:start position:0%
uh section
 
04:04:06.229 --> 04:04:06.239 align:start position:0%
77a20a distribution of funds for the
 
04:04:08.269 --> 04:04:08.279 align:start position:0%
business profits tax and the business
 
04:04:11.570 --> 04:04:11.580 align:start position:0%
Enterprise tax uh is approximately the
 
04:04:13.429 --> 04:04:13.439 align:start position:0%
same thing the commissioner shall
 
04:04:14.990 --> 04:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
determine the additional amounts of
 
04:04:17.689 --> 04:04:17.699 align:start position:0%
Revenue produced by an increase of 1.5
 
04:04:21.250 --> 04:04:21.260 align:start position:0%
percent in the rate of tax imposed by
 
04:04:24.530 --> 04:04:24.540 align:start position:0%
77.82 for each fiscal year and she'll
 
04:04:26.750 --> 04:04:26.760 align:start position:0%
certify such amounts to the state
 
04:04:28.910 --> 04:04:28.920 align:start position:0%
treasurer by October 1 of that year for
 
04:04:31.550 --> 04:04:31.560 align:start position:0%
deposit in the education trust fund
 
04:04:34.150 --> 04:04:34.160 align:start position:0%
established by RSA
 
04:04:37.969 --> 04:04:37.979 align:start position:0%
198.39 on now
 
04:04:41.150 --> 04:04:41.160 align:start position:0%
I've consulted Phil sletton of the New
 
04:04:43.250 --> 04:04:43.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire fiscal policy Institute he
 
04:04:46.429 --> 04:04:46.439 align:start position:0%
says that people have been finessing
 
04:04:46.439 --> 04:04:47.330 align:start position:0%
says that people have been finessing
this

04:04:47.330 --> 04:04:47.340 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:04:50.389 --> 04:04:50.399 align:start position:0%
for quite a while but essentially what
 
04:04:54.050 --> 04:04:54.060 align:start position:0%
they're saying is that if each time you
 
04:04:56.450 --> 04:04:56.460 align:start position:0%
lower the tax less money should be going
 
04:04:59.630 --> 04:04:59.640 align:start position:0%
into the education trust fund so my
 
04:05:01.189 --> 04:05:01.199 align:start position:0%
question is
 
04:05:05.330 --> 04:05:05.340 align:start position:0%
is this going to be amended and if so in
 
04:05:08.210 --> 04:05:08.220 align:start position:0%
which way are we going to continue to
 
04:05:11.450 --> 04:05:11.460 align:start position:0%
ignore the law and just send what we
 
04:05:14.510 --> 04:05:14.520 align:start position:0%
originally promised to the education uh
 
04:05:19.370 --> 04:05:19.380 align:start position:0%
trust fund on or are we going to remove
 
04:05:21.410 --> 04:05:21.420 align:start position:0%
it from the general fund who's going to
 
04:05:23.389 --> 04:05:23.399 align:start position:0%
lose on this
 
04:05:26.809 --> 04:05:26.819 align:start position:0%
thank you well it's an assumption uh
 
04:05:28.309 --> 04:05:28.319 align:start position:0%
representative that we're going to lose
 
04:05:30.110 --> 04:05:30.120 align:start position:0%
on this we don't believe you are going
 
04:05:32.389 --> 04:05:32.399 align:start position:0%
to lose in the long run so I guess I
 
04:05:34.370 --> 04:05:34.380 align:start position:0%
would just have to disagree with your
 
04:05:34.380 --> 04:05:37.750 align:start position:0%
would just have to disagree with your
assessment

04:05:37.750 --> 04:05:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:41.330 --> 04:05:41.340 align:start position:0%
any other uh oh any other well I guess
 
04:05:43.849 --> 04:05:43.859 align:start position:0%
we do have two more questions uh uh
 
04:05:46.189 --> 04:05:46.199 align:start position:0%
Edith uh Tucker police Senator
 
04:05:49.189 --> 04:05:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:53.630 --> 04:05:53.640 align:start position:0%
yes uh did you consider lowering the
 
04:05:57.170 --> 04:05:57.180 align:start position:0%
business Enterprise tax War
 
04:06:00.110 --> 04:06:00.120 align:start position:0%
and why did you reject that as an as a
 
04:06:04.429 --> 04:06:04.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:07.070 --> 04:06:07.080 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm not sure I mean to reduce it
 
04:06:09.170 --> 04:06:09.180 align:start position:0%
below 0.5 percent
 
04:06:09.180 --> 04:06:11.150 align:start position:0%
below 0.5 percent
yeah

04:06:11.150 --> 04:06:11.160 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:06:13.910 --> 04:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
uh this well honestly representative
 
04:06:16.729 --> 04:06:16.739 align:start position:0%
this is the bill that working Center had
 
04:06:18.410 --> 04:06:18.420 align:start position:0%
written I just took over the final
 
04:06:21.889 --> 04:06:21.899 align:start position:0%
Quantum so obviously I can't ask them
 
04:06:24.469 --> 04:06:24.479 align:start position:0%
why you take point five percent I was
 
04:06:26.269 --> 04:06:26.279 align:start position:0%
around when the business Enterprise tax
 
04:06:28.189 --> 04:06:28.199 align:start position:0%
was first put in place
 
04:06:28.199 --> 04:06:31.030 align:start position:0%
was first put in place
and

04:06:31.030 --> 04:06:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:34.429 --> 04:06:34.439 align:start position:0%
at that point it was 0.25 and it's
 
04:06:37.849 --> 04:06:37.859 align:start position:0%
placed it went up as high as 0.275 and
 
04:06:40.010 --> 04:06:40.020 align:start position:0%
now we're bringing this we're suggesting
 
04:06:46.910 --> 04:06:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:50.210 --> 04:06:50.220 align:start position:0%
could I follow up please let's follow up
 
04:06:53.450 --> 04:06:53.460 align:start position:0%
uh the reason I ask is that
 
04:06:56.389 --> 04:06:56.399 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that the BET really
 
04:06:59.809 --> 04:06:59.819 align:start position:0%
is the sort of the mom-and-pop branch of
 
04:07:02.809 --> 04:07:02.819 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire this is the group that has
 
04:07:02.819 --> 04:07:04.130 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire this is the group that has
really

04:07:04.130 --> 04:07:04.140 align:start position:0%
really
 
04:07:09.469 --> 04:07:09.479 align:start position:0%
been pained and hurt by the pandemic
 
04:07:11.870 --> 04:07:11.880 align:start position:0%
so I was wondering whether we shouldn't
 
04:07:15.469 --> 04:07:15.479 align:start position:0%
be considering even a lower amount for
 
04:07:17.229 --> 04:07:17.239 align:start position:0%
the vet
 
04:07:19.550 --> 04:07:19.560 align:start position:0%
representative anytime you want to lower
 
04:07:23.689 --> 04:07:23.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:25.370 --> 04:07:25.380 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I couldn't understand you
 
04:07:27.410 --> 04:07:27.420 align:start position:0%
representative anytime you want to lower
 
04:07:29.689 --> 04:07:29.699 align:start position:0%
taxes you won't get an argument from me
 
04:07:32.630 --> 04:07:32.640 align:start position:0%
I'm absolutely fine with it will lower
 
04:07:35.269 --> 04:07:35.279 align:start position:0%
it more that's fine with me great thank
 
04:07:37.010 --> 04:07:37.020 align:start position:0%

04:08:50.150 --> 04:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
no I guess we don't I guess we don't
 
04:08:52.189 --> 04:08:52.199 align:start position:0%
have it but Norm uh representative major
 
04:08:54.830 --> 04:08:54.840 align:start position:0%
will talk us through the charts
 
04:08:57.229 --> 04:08:57.239 align:start position:0%
and then uh make sure that everybody
 
04:08:59.750 --> 04:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
gets these these charts uh
 
04:08:59.760 --> 04:09:01.550 align:start position:0%
gets these these charts uh
afterwards

04:09:01.550 --> 04:09:01.560 align:start position:0%
afterwards
 
04:09:04.130 --> 04:09:04.140 align:start position:0%
representative major
 
04:09:06.170 --> 04:09:06.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
04:09:10.269 --> 04:09:10.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:13.070 --> 04:09:13.080 align:start position:0%
to better understand
 
04:09:16.150 --> 04:09:16.160 align:start position:0%
what's happening to the DCT
 
04:09:19.849 --> 04:09:19.859 align:start position:0%
we've changed the rate and what and what
 
04:09:21.889 --> 04:09:21.899 align:start position:0%
happens to the revenues that question
 
04:09:25.130 --> 04:09:25.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:28.550 --> 04:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
what I did is I made a copy of the chart
 
04:09:30.830 --> 04:09:30.840 align:start position:0%
from one of the handouts that was given
 
04:09:33.349 --> 04:09:33.359 align:start position:0%
to us in our orientation
 
04:09:37.370 --> 04:09:37.380 align:start position:0%
and on page 17
 
04:09:44.689 --> 04:09:44.699 align:start position:0%
a it's the bptvt revenue 10-year trend
 
04:09:47.750 --> 04:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
and I looked at that and that 10-year
 
04:09:50.330 --> 04:09:50.340 align:start position:0%
Trend was from 2011.
 
04:09:53.710 --> 04:09:53.720 align:start position:0%
to 2020.
 
04:09:56.150 --> 04:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
what's striking
 
04:09:58.309 --> 04:09:58.319 align:start position:0%
if you take
 
04:10:01.670 --> 04:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
from 2011
 
04:10:01.680 --> 04:10:02.290 align:start position:0%
from 2011
to

04:10:02.290 --> 04:10:02.300 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:10:05.870 --> 04:10:05.880 align:start position:0%
2015 that was before
 
04:10:09.110 --> 04:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
there's a break changes in the p-e-t OR
 
04:10:09.120 --> 04:10:10.790 align:start position:0%
there's a break changes in the p-e-t OR
BPT

04:10:10.790 --> 04:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
BPT
 
04:10:13.910 --> 04:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
that the changes in the total revenue
 
04:10:18.550 --> 04:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:21.170 --> 04:10:21.180 align:start position:0%
490.2 million dollars
 
04:10:25.670 --> 04:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
to 560 61 million dollars
 
04:10:29.510 --> 04:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
or 71.5 million dollar increase
 
04:10:32.830 --> 04:10:32.840 align:start position:0%
from 2011 to 2015
 
04:10:35.570 --> 04:10:35.580 align:start position:0%
14.6 increase
 
04:10:39.229 --> 04:10:39.239 align:start position:0%
and that was the vpt rate of eight and a
 
04:10:41.030 --> 04:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
half percent which I've been there for a
 
04:10:46.070 --> 04:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
while and the BBT rate of 0.75
 
04:10:48.830 --> 04:10:48.840 align:start position:0%
the next four years
 
04:10:51.590 --> 04:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
from 2015
 
04:10:56.269 --> 04:10:56.279 align:start position:0%
the 2019 we started reducing the rates
 
04:10:58.010 --> 04:10:58.020 align:start position:0%
of the business profits on the business
 
04:11:00.110 --> 04:11:00.120 align:start position:0%
Enterprise tax
 
04:11:03.950 --> 04:11:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:06.830 --> 04:11:06.840 align:start position:0%
a rate of eight and a half percent in
 
04:11:13.790 --> 04:11:13.800 align:start position:0%
2015 to 7.7 percent in 2019 over four
 
04:11:18.309 --> 04:11:18.319 align:start position:0%
weight loss from 825 to 8.2
 
04:11:20.870 --> 04:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
7.97.7 percent
 
04:11:23.769 --> 04:11:23.779 align:start position:0%
which is a total drop of
 
04:11:25.969 --> 04:11:25.979 align:start position:0%
0.8 percent
 
04:11:28.429 --> 04:11:28.439 align:start position:0%
in the same time we dropped the rate of
 
04:11:30.170 --> 04:11:30.180 align:start position:0%
the bet
 
04:11:32.349 --> 04:11:32.359 align:start position:0%
from 0.75
 
04:11:35.990 --> 04:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
to 0.6 percent
 
04:11:39.349 --> 04:11:39.359 align:start position:0%
over that same time period over four
 
04:11:41.150 --> 04:11:41.160 align:start position:0%
different weight loss
 
04:11:44.929 --> 04:11:44.939 align:start position:0%
and what happened to the revenues
 
04:11:49.729 --> 04:11:49.739 align:start position:0%
well the revenues fly Under the Red Rock
 
04:11:51.830 --> 04:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
over those four years
 
04:11:55.429 --> 04:11:55.439 align:start position:0%
had risen 14.6 percent
 
04:11:58.429 --> 04:11:58.439 align:start position:0%
over the next four years and dropping
 
04:12:02.450 --> 04:12:02.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:04.929 --> 04:12:04.939 align:start position:0%
the rivers grew
 
04:12:09.250 --> 04:12:09.260 align:start position:0%
243.9 million dollars or a total of
 
04:12:13.550 --> 04:12:13.560 align:start position:0%
43.7 percent in this in four years the
 
04:12:16.309 --> 04:12:16.319 align:start position:0%
previous boy is that without any rate
 
04:12:20.929 --> 04:12:20.939 align:start position:0%
drops the revenue increase 14.6 let me
 
04:12:22.370 --> 04:12:22.380 align:start position:0%
say that again
 
04:12:24.889 --> 04:12:24.899 align:start position:0%
in these four years when you saw the
 
04:12:26.269 --> 04:12:26.279 align:start position:0%
rape drops
 
04:12:28.929 --> 04:12:28.939 align:start position:0%
the revenues increased by
 
04:12:31.490 --> 04:12:31.500 align:start position:0%
243.9 million dollars
 
04:12:33.950 --> 04:12:33.960 align:start position:0%
so that question of what happened when
 
04:12:38.389 --> 04:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
you make rate drops and to the revenues
 
04:12:42.830 --> 04:12:42.840 align:start position:0%
in this case what it did it encouraged
 
04:12:46.429 --> 04:12:46.439 align:start position:0%
more economic activity which you can
 
04:12:50.030 --> 04:12:50.040 align:start position:0%
tell it's greater revenues
 
04:12:56.090 --> 04:12:56.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:59.630 --> 04:12:59.640 align:start position:0%
questions questions press the button
 
04:13:02.510 --> 04:13:02.520 align:start position:0%
any other questions of Representative
 
04:13:02.520 --> 04:13:06.590 align:start position:0%
any other questions of Representative
major

04:13:06.590 --> 04:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:06.600 --> 04:13:07.670 align:start position:0%
 
oh

04:13:07.670 --> 04:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
oh
 
04:13:12.710 --> 04:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:12.720 --> 04:13:21.410 align:start position:0%
 
unmute

04:13:21.410 --> 04:13:21.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:24.769 --> 04:13:24.779 align:start position:0%
sorry I suggest that we first compare
 
04:13:28.849 --> 04:13:28.859 align:start position:0%
these growth rates with uh the national
 
04:13:32.929 --> 04:13:32.939 align:start position:0%
GDP and the stock market rates which
 
04:13:35.389 --> 04:13:35.399 align:start position:0%
seem to have quite a lot to do with our
 
04:13:39.410 --> 04:13:39.420 align:start position:0%
our tax growth on and also would remind
 
04:13:42.830 --> 04:13:42.840 align:start position:0%
you I think it was 2016 the first year
 
04:13:46.130 --> 04:13:46.140 align:start position:0%
there that you're talking about that we
 
04:13:48.290 --> 04:13:48.300 align:start position:0%
finally recovered from the Great
 
04:13:51.950 --> 04:13:51.960 align:start position:0%
Recession and started to grow again
 
04:13:53.990 --> 04:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:13:59.349 --> 04:13:59.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:03.530 --> 04:14:03.540 align:start position:0%
the question was uh shouldn't we compare
 
04:14:05.929 --> 04:14:05.939 align:start position:0%
it with the source of our Revenue which
 
04:14:11.090 --> 04:14:11.100 align:start position:0%
is mostly outside this outside the state
 
04:14:13.130 --> 04:14:13.140 align:start position:0%
representative major you want to respond
 
04:14:18.610 --> 04:14:18.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:21.650 --> 04:14:21.660 align:start position:0%
what I did in this announcement that the
 
04:14:25.130 --> 04:14:25.140 align:start position:0%
total revenue growth the revenue is made
 
04:14:28.849 --> 04:14:28.859 align:start position:0%
up of corporate taxes yes a lot of the
 
04:14:30.469 --> 04:14:30.479 align:start position:0%
corporate taxes
 
04:14:32.750 --> 04:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
comes from corporations outside the
 
04:14:35.570 --> 04:14:35.580 align:start position:0%
state and the profits that they make in
 
04:14:37.550 --> 04:14:37.560 align:start position:0%
that state
 
04:14:39.229 --> 04:14:39.239 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
04:14:42.050 --> 04:14:42.060 align:start position:0%
the reason that they put profits within
 
04:14:50.570 --> 04:14:50.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:00.950 --> 04:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:04.189 --> 04:15:04.199 align:start position:0%
as far as the DVP
 
04:15:06.050 --> 04:15:06.060 align:start position:0%
if you look
 
04:15:09.189 --> 04:15:09.199 align:start position:0%
the very recession is
 
04:15:13.790 --> 04:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
0708 and 9 it took a while to run out
 
04:15:18.290 --> 04:15:18.300 align:start position:0%
started this analysis into the positive
 
04:15:21.250 --> 04:15:21.260 align:start position:0%
in 2011
 
04:15:23.929 --> 04:15:23.939 align:start position:0%
the world was stagnant
 
04:15:25.790 --> 04:15:25.800 align:start position:0%
I mean it went up
 
04:15:30.429 --> 04:15:30.439 align:start position:0%
from 2011 490 million dollars
 
04:15:34.030 --> 04:15:34.040 align:start position:0%
516 million in 2012
 
04:15:37.429 --> 04:15:37.439 align:start position:0%
551 in 2013.
 
04:15:41.330 --> 04:15:41.340 align:start position:0%
in 549 2014.
 
04:15:44.929 --> 04:15:44.939 align:start position:0%
in 2015 was 561. it was
 
04:15:50.150 --> 04:15:50.160 align:start position:0%
the growth is it was almost why
 
04:15:50.160 --> 04:15:51.830 align:start position:0%
the growth is it was almost why
no

04:15:51.830 --> 04:15:51.840 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:15:54.950 --> 04:15:54.960 align:start position:0%
in 2016
 
04:15:57.950 --> 04:15:57.960 align:start position:0%
we had our first record
 
04:16:00.769 --> 04:16:00.779 align:start position:0%
and it was a 699
 
04:16:03.110 --> 04:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
and then
 
04:16:06.429 --> 04:16:06.439 align:start position:0%
through 2019
 
04:16:09.050 --> 04:16:09.060 align:start position:0%
805. seconds
 
04:16:10.849 --> 04:16:10.859 align:start position:0%
so it was
 
04:16:13.790 --> 04:16:13.800 align:start position:0%
quite a steep whoa
 
04:16:15.710 --> 04:16:15.720 align:start position:0%
in those four years while we were
 
04:16:22.309 --> 04:16:22.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:22.319 --> 04:16:23.870 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:16:23.870 --> 04:16:23.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:16:23.880 --> 04:16:25.010 align:start position:0%
okay
um

04:16:25.010 --> 04:16:25.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:16:25.020 --> 04:16:33.349 align:start position:0%
um
yeah

04:16:33.349 --> 04:16:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:34.969 --> 04:16:34.979 align:start position:0%
can you hear me
 
04:16:37.490 --> 04:16:37.500 align:start position:0%
yes okay
 
04:16:40.610 --> 04:16:40.620 align:start position:0%
um I guess my question is uh along the
 
04:16:42.590 --> 04:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
same lines as the question that was just
 
04:16:46.550 --> 04:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
asked and I think
 
04:16:49.490 --> 04:16:49.500 align:start position:0%
we all know that there are many
 
04:16:52.969 --> 04:16:52.979 align:start position:0%
variables that affect uh the prophets
 
04:16:55.729 --> 04:16:55.739 align:start position:0%
reported by our time the taxable
 
04:16:58.550 --> 04:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
businesses in New Hampshire
 
04:17:02.990 --> 04:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
um and those variables obviously uh then
 
04:17:03.000 --> 04:17:03.830 align:start position:0%
um and those variables obviously uh then
um

04:17:03.830 --> 04:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:17:08.410 --> 04:17:08.420 align:start position:0%
well the variables in the tax collected
 
04:17:11.809 --> 04:17:11.819 align:start position:0%
is dependent on
 
04:17:11.819 --> 04:17:15.769 align:start position:0%
is dependent on
the

04:17:15.769 --> 04:17:15.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:20.030 --> 04:17:20.040 align:start position:0%
factors that representative Ami spoke to
 
04:17:25.010 --> 04:17:25.020 align:start position:0%
um and to the uh and I'm not saying this
 
04:17:28.729 --> 04:17:28.739 align:start position:0%
very well there there's tax rates and
 
04:17:31.550 --> 04:17:31.560 align:start position:0%
there's the profit amount and the amount
 
04:17:35.330 --> 04:17:35.340 align:start position:0%
of profit that's reported each year is a
 
04:17:37.910 --> 04:17:37.920 align:start position:0%
function of many things and one is the
 
04:17:40.670 --> 04:17:40.680 align:start position:0%
larger National economy another is the
 
04:17:43.370 --> 04:17:43.380 align:start position:0%
international economy and another is the
 
04:17:45.170 --> 04:17:45.180 align:start position:0%
state economy and
 
04:17:47.510 --> 04:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
than the amount collected depends on the
 
04:17:50.030 --> 04:17:50.040 align:start position:0%
rates and I my question to you
 
04:17:52.429 --> 04:17:52.439 align:start position:0%
representative major is wouldn't you
 
04:17:56.809 --> 04:17:56.819 align:start position:0%
agree that in making any judgment
 
04:17:59.570 --> 04:17:59.580 align:start position:0%
as to how
 
04:18:02.870 --> 04:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
what the impact of a rate change at the
 
04:18:04.150 --> 04:18:04.160 align:start position:0%
state level
 
04:18:06.849 --> 04:18:06.859 align:start position:0%
has been would be
 
04:18:10.910 --> 04:18:10.920 align:start position:0%
that's a very careful assessment of
 
04:18:13.670 --> 04:18:13.680 align:start position:0%
those other factors including changes in
 
04:18:16.630 --> 04:18:16.640 align:start position:0%
the federal tax law for example
 
04:18:19.429 --> 04:18:19.439 align:start position:0%
is needed and that when you go through
 
04:18:22.790 --> 04:18:22.800 align:start position:0%
such an examination it's uh it's not
 
04:18:24.769 --> 04:18:24.779 align:start position:0%
easy to do other kind of conclusions
 
04:18:27.550 --> 04:18:27.560 align:start position:0%
that you suggested we should draw
 
04:18:27.560 --> 04:18:29.469 align:start position:0%
that you suggested we should draw
from

04:18:29.469 --> 04:18:29.479 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:18:34.200 --> 04:18:34.210 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:34.210 --> 04:18:36.969 align:start position:0%

04:18:36.969 --> 04:18:36.979 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:18:39.590 --> 04:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
I'm having a hard time hearing you I'm
 
04:18:39.600 --> 04:18:40.490 align:start position:0%
I'm having a hard time hearing you I'm
sorry

04:18:40.490 --> 04:18:40.500 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
04:18:42.349 --> 04:18:42.359 align:start position:0%
I gotta talk into the microphone
 
04:18:42.359 --> 04:18:44.210 align:start position:0%
I gotta talk into the microphone
representative

04:18:44.210 --> 04:18:44.220 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:18:47.330 --> 04:18:47.340 align:start position:0%
yeah right the amount of vectors
 
04:18:52.370 --> 04:18:52.380 align:start position:0%
involved in determining uh
 
04:18:54.590 --> 04:18:54.600 align:start position:0%
represent major yes you may want to take
 
04:18:57.050 --> 04:18:57.060 align:start position:0%
your face mask down with the help
 
04:18:57.060 --> 04:19:02.929 align:start position:0%
your face mask down with the help
question

04:19:02.929 --> 04:19:02.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:04.849 --> 04:19:04.859 align:start position:0%
he's very socially distanced for those
 
04:19:06.410 --> 04:19:06.420 align:start position:0%
not in the room
 
04:19:08.809 --> 04:19:08.819 align:start position:0%
right there's at least six feet apart
 
04:19:10.550 --> 04:19:10.560 align:start position:0%
between us
 
04:19:13.309 --> 04:19:13.319 align:start position:0%
yeah you're right there's a lot of
 
04:19:18.050 --> 04:19:18.060 align:start position:0%
vectors involved in determining what the
 
04:19:23.150 --> 04:19:23.160 align:start position:0%
economic effects today on total revenue
 
04:19:23.160 --> 04:19:27.290 align:start position:0%
economic effects today on total revenue
GDP

04:19:27.290 --> 04:19:27.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:30.110 --> 04:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
unemployment right now is the pandemic
 
04:19:34.189 --> 04:19:34.199 align:start position:0%
rate changes a lot of variables but
 
04:19:34.199 --> 04:19:35.630 align:start position:0%
rate changes a lot of variables but
overall

04:19:35.630 --> 04:19:35.640 align:start position:0%
overall
 
04:19:38.510 --> 04:19:38.520 align:start position:0%
what I did is I looked at the two
 
04:19:41.269 --> 04:19:41.279 align:start position:0%
periods generally professional first
 
04:19:43.969 --> 04:19:43.979 align:start position:0%
period of four years you had all kinds
 
04:19:46.490 --> 04:19:46.500 align:start position:0%
of things going on the same as you have
 
04:19:50.389 --> 04:19:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:53.030 --> 04:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
but the sum of everything
 
04:19:56.570 --> 04:19:56.580 align:start position:0%
is that while these great changes were
 
04:20:00.650 --> 04:20:00.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:03.530 --> 04:20:03.540 align:start position:0%
there wasn't a year that wasn't any
 
04:20:03.540 --> 04:20:04.910 align:start position:0%
there wasn't a year that wasn't any
better

04:20:04.910 --> 04:20:04.920 align:start position:0%
better
 
04:20:07.849 --> 04:20:07.859 align:start position:0%
that was worse than the previous four
 
04:20:11.870 --> 04:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:16.309 --> 04:20:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:16.319 --> 04:20:17.889 align:start position:0%
 
that

04:20:17.889 --> 04:20:17.899 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:20:22.670 --> 04:20:22.680 align:start position:0%
this does show where rate changes
 
04:20:25.490 --> 04:20:25.500 align:start position:0%
and they're very small incremental
 
04:20:25.500 --> 04:20:26.750 align:start position:0%
and they're very small incremental
rating

04:20:26.750 --> 04:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
rating
 
04:20:28.729 --> 04:20:28.739 align:start position:0%
could not
 
04:20:33.530 --> 04:20:33.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:36.469 --> 04:20:36.479 align:start position:0%
but there is you know if you lower the
 
04:20:36.479 --> 04:20:37.250 align:start position:0%
but there is you know if you lower the
rate

04:20:37.250 --> 04:20:37.260 align:start position:0%
rate
 
04:20:39.290 --> 04:20:39.300 align:start position:0%
you may just get
 
04:20:42.889 --> 04:20:42.899 align:start position:0%
more businesses to come in here more
 
04:20:51.130 --> 04:20:51.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:53.450 --> 04:20:53.460 align:start position:0%
you said
 
04:20:57.349 --> 04:20:57.359 align:start position:0%
I think I am for now I I look forward to
 
04:21:00.229 --> 04:21:00.239 align:start position:0%
continuing dialogue and discussion with
 
04:21:02.150 --> 04:21:02.160 align:start position:0%
representative major and others as we go
 
04:21:04.189 --> 04:21:04.199 align:start position:0%
into work sessions to look at the facts
 
04:21:09.189 --> 04:21:09.199 align:start position:0%
facts are facts and uh we uh can try to
 
04:21:13.910 --> 04:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
come to a common understanding of what
 
04:21:15.830 --> 04:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
has happened to help us forecast what
 
04:21:18.590 --> 04:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
will happen I think this is very murky
 
04:21:20.689 --> 04:21:20.699 align:start position:0%
territory I'm sure representative major
 
04:21:23.990 --> 04:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
would agree it's incredibly complex as
 
04:21:26.469 --> 04:21:26.479 align:start position:0%
he says there are many different vectors
 
04:21:30.050 --> 04:21:30.060 align:start position:0%
come into play and uh let's all look at
 
04:21:31.969 --> 04:21:31.979 align:start position:0%
it together and do an honest assessment
 
04:21:34.370 --> 04:21:34.380 align:start position:0%
uh if
 
04:21:37.250 --> 04:21:37.260 align:start position:0%
yeah I'll leave it at that and I
 
04:21:39.290 --> 04:21:39.300 align:start position:0%
certainly would love
 
04:21:41.880 --> 04:21:41.890 align:start position:0%
I'll be glad we can sit down
 
04:21:41.890 --> 04:21:45.229 align:start position:0%
I'll be glad we can sit down
[Music]

04:21:45.229 --> 04:21:45.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:47.689 --> 04:21:47.699 align:start position:0%
yes I I agree we are definitely have
 
04:21:50.389 --> 04:21:50.399 align:start position:0%
work session on this bill so uh so
 
04:21:53.450 --> 04:21:53.460 align:start position:0%
there's two more uh members no uh okay
 
04:21:56.030 --> 04:21:56.040 align:start position:0%
representative uh Schomburg waves off uh
 
04:21:58.070 --> 04:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
representative ulery we have a question
 
04:22:01.429 --> 04:22:01.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:05.030 --> 04:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:05.040 --> 04:22:06.229 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:22:06.229 --> 04:22:06.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:09.530 --> 04:22:09.540 align:start position:0%
if I recall correctly in the past
 
04:22:12.710 --> 04:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
with the exception of the tobacco tax
 
04:22:14.570 --> 04:22:14.580 align:start position:0%
when there's been a modification
 
04:22:14.580 --> 04:22:16.130 align:start position:0%
when there's been a modification
downward

04:22:16.130 --> 04:22:16.140 align:start position:0%
downward
 
04:22:18.769 --> 04:22:18.779 align:start position:0%
of our taxes
 
04:22:21.950 --> 04:22:21.960 align:start position:0%
there's been an increase in Revenue
 
04:22:26.689 --> 04:22:26.699 align:start position:0%
all right yes Susan I see you smile
 
04:22:28.429 --> 04:22:28.439 align:start position:0%
that's the nice thing about this
 
04:22:30.950 --> 04:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
distance stuff at any rate
 
04:22:33.170 --> 04:22:33.180 align:start position:0%
I remember getting
 
04:22:37.250 --> 04:22:37.260 align:start position:0%
um some facts as representative Ames uh
 
04:22:41.870 --> 04:22:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:46.250 --> 04:22:46.260 align:start position:0%
from LBA regarding what has happened in
 
04:22:50.090 --> 04:22:50.100 align:start position:0%
uh over time whenever we've done this uh
 
04:22:53.050 --> 04:22:53.060 align:start position:0%
that may be helpful don't you agree
 
04:22:56.030 --> 04:22:56.040 align:start position:0%
representative major
 
04:22:56.040 --> 04:22:57.490 align:start position:0%
representative major
yes

04:22:57.490 --> 04:22:57.500 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:23:00.349 --> 04:23:00.359 align:start position:0%
you know there are certain things that
 
04:23:03.349 --> 04:23:03.359 align:start position:0%
aren't as complex such as the bear tax
 
04:23:05.990 --> 04:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
if we rate if we lower the rate on that
 
04:23:08.229 --> 04:23:08.239 align:start position:0%
we would definitely reduce our revenues
 
04:23:12.950 --> 04:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
because the same set over the years the
 
04:23:18.170 --> 04:23:18.180 align:start position:0%
volume of the there that is taxed has
 
04:23:20.030 --> 04:23:20.040 align:start position:0%
been very consistent
 
04:23:27.769 --> 04:23:27.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:30.170 --> 04:23:30.180 align:start position:0%
hey uh any other questions of
 
04:23:32.929 --> 04:23:32.939 align:start position:0%
Representative major I see none thank
 
04:23:34.090 --> 04:23:34.100 align:start position:0%
you very much
 
04:23:37.189 --> 04:23:37.199 align:start position:0%
so look we have uh two other uh well we
 
04:23:39.769 --> 04:23:39.779 align:start position:0%
have uh one other uh individual who
 
04:23:41.330 --> 04:23:41.340 align:start position:0%
would stand up in a pink card if you
 
04:23:42.950 --> 04:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
will and then we have Department of
 
04:23:45.650 --> 04:23:45.660 align:start position:0%
Revenue and then we have two other hands
 
04:23:47.269 --> 04:23:47.279 align:start position:0%
that are up so I'm going to start with
 
04:23:49.910 --> 04:23:49.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue and then uh Greg
 
04:23:52.130 --> 04:23:52.140 align:start position:0%
Moore your next Tim representative
 
04:23:54.290 --> 04:23:54.300 align:start position:0%
Horrigan your next after that and then
 
04:23:57.290 --> 04:23:57.300 align:start position:0%
Jewel Klein your next after that so
 
04:23:58.490 --> 04:23:58.500 align:start position:0%
let's start with Department Revenue
 
04:24:01.870 --> 04:24:01.880 align:start position:0%
that's uh uh do you want to be honest
 
04:24:05.090 --> 04:24:05.100 align:start position:0%
Melissa Rollins and uh Carolyn Lair do
 
04:24:07.429 --> 04:24:07.439 align:start position:0%
you want to do this together
 
04:24:09.290 --> 04:24:09.300 align:start position:0%
oh can we can we open about both
 
04:24:09.300 --> 04:24:12.469 align:start position:0%
oh can we can we open about both
together

04:24:12.469 --> 04:24:12.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:14.630 --> 04:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
great thank you representative abrami
 
04:24:16.309 --> 04:24:16.319 align:start position:0%
thanks for promoting both Carol and Lear
 
04:24:17.809 --> 04:24:17.819 align:start position:0%
the assistant commissioner of the
 
04:24:19.189 --> 04:24:19.199 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue as well as myself
 
04:24:21.590 --> 04:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
Melissa Rollins senior financial analyst
 
04:24:23.389 --> 04:24:23.399 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Revenue I just
 
04:24:24.769 --> 04:24:24.779 align:start position:0%
want to make sure you can hear me first
 
04:24:27.410 --> 04:24:27.420 align:start position:0%
yes Ken okay perfect
 
04:24:30.229 --> 04:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
all right so I um you've seem pretty
 
04:24:32.210 --> 04:24:32.220 align:start position:0%
familiar with the bill so far it's been
 
04:24:34.429 --> 04:24:34.439 align:start position:0%
explained very well that the business
 
04:24:36.889 --> 04:24:36.899 align:start position:0%
rates go down twice in this bill so I'm
 
04:24:38.269 --> 04:24:38.279 align:start position:0%
just going to speak to our fiscal note
 
04:24:40.550 --> 04:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
and our fiscal analysis
 
04:24:42.650 --> 04:24:42.660 align:start position:0%
we have provided a fiscal note quick
 
04:24:45.050 --> 04:24:45.060 align:start position:0%
guide which basically mirrors the fiscal
 
04:24:46.370 --> 04:24:46.380 align:start position:0%
note that you have in front of you
 
04:24:48.110 --> 04:24:48.120 align:start position:0%
that's back to the bill so if you want
 
04:24:49.309 --> 04:24:49.319 align:start position:0%
to look at that while I'm chatting it
 
04:24:51.050 --> 04:24:51.060 align:start position:0%
might make a little bit more sense as I
 
04:24:52.490 --> 04:24:52.500 align:start position:0%
go through
 
04:24:54.710 --> 04:24:54.720 align:start position:0%
first off I want to note this is a
 
04:24:57.830 --> 04:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
static analysis our fiscal impact is
 
04:24:57.840 --> 04:25:00.229 align:start position:0%
static analysis our fiscal impact is
indeterminable

04:25:00.229 --> 04:25:00.239 align:start position:0%
indeterminable
 
04:25:02.809 --> 04:25:02.819 align:start position:0%
during the static analysis our starting
 
04:25:06.530 --> 04:25:06.540 align:start position:0%
point was fiscal year 2020 Cash basis
 
04:25:09.590 --> 04:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
plus anomalous Revenue you've heard us
 
04:25:11.090 --> 04:25:11.100 align:start position:0%
in the past couple of weeks talk a lot
 
04:25:13.070 --> 04:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
about this anomalous Revenue you know
 
04:25:15.170 --> 04:25:15.180 align:start position:0%
that it belongs back in fiscal year 20.
 
04:25:17.210 --> 04:25:17.220 align:start position:0%
so our starting point for business taxes
 
04:25:20.590 --> 04:25:20.600 align:start position:0%
as a whole is the 69 or
 
04:25:23.510 --> 04:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
697.5 million
 
04:25:26.030 --> 04:25:26.040 align:start position:0%
so we take that amount and then we need
 
04:25:28.189 --> 04:25:28.199 align:start position:0%
to tweak it a little bit to get it to be
 
04:25:30.889 --> 04:25:30.899 align:start position:0%
the true amount for fiscal year 20 which
 
04:25:33.830 --> 04:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
is bringing it to 691.5 million and
 
04:25:35.150 --> 04:25:35.160 align:start position:0%
that's because you've heard me speak
 
04:25:38.149 --> 04:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
before about how tax years cross
 
04:25:41.269 --> 04:25:41.279 align:start position:0%
multiple fiscal fiscal years
 
04:25:44.090 --> 04:25:44.100 align:start position:0%
and in fiscal year 20 we are feeling the
 
04:25:46.429 --> 04:25:46.439 align:start position:0%
last impact of excuse me in fiscally or
 
04:25:48.170 --> 04:25:48.180 align:start position:0%
21 we're feeling the last impact of our
 
04:25:50.330 --> 04:25:50.340 align:start position:0%
last rate reduction so we need to adjust
 
04:25:53.809 --> 04:25:53.819 align:start position:0%
for that prior to this bill being put
 
04:25:56.750 --> 04:25:56.760 align:start position:0%
forth so our starting point is 691.5
 
04:26:00.469 --> 04:26:00.479 align:start position:0%
million we then take that amount
 
04:26:03.469 --> 04:26:03.479 align:start position:0%
and we apply the applicable rates based
 
04:26:05.750 --> 04:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
on each fiscal year to get our to get us
 
04:26:08.870 --> 04:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
to our bases and once we have the bases
 
04:26:11.809 --> 04:26:11.819 align:start position:0%
we then are applying the rates as we
 
04:26:14.450 --> 04:26:14.460 align:start position:0%
move forward and the reason we have the
 
04:26:16.070 --> 04:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
chart that's in the sheet it's called
 
04:26:19.309 --> 04:26:19.319 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation rates in splits
 
04:26:22.010 --> 04:26:22.020 align:start position:0%
it's a good visual to show you how the
 
04:26:24.290 --> 04:26:24.300 align:start position:0%
tax years cross each fiscal year because
 
04:26:25.969 --> 04:26:25.979 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of moving parts from
 
04:26:28.729 --> 04:26:28.739 align:start position:0%
making this calculation
 
04:26:31.189 --> 04:26:31.199 align:start position:0%
so using those rates and splits and
 
04:26:33.410 --> 04:26:33.420 align:start position:0%
applying the base to each of those race
 
04:26:35.210 --> 04:26:35.220 align:start position:0%
rates and splits
 
04:26:37.370 --> 04:26:37.380 align:start position:0%
we end up with a final estimated
 
04:26:39.530 --> 04:26:39.540 align:start position:0%
cumulative fiscal impact
 
04:26:41.809 --> 04:26:41.819 align:start position:0%
starting in fiscal year one fiscal year
 
04:26:46.429 --> 04:26:46.439 align:start position:0%
21 of negative 5.9 million with a total
 
04:26:50.389 --> 04:26:50.399 align:start position:0%
cumulative fiscal impact of 53.7 million
 
04:26:52.969 --> 04:26:52.979 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 24 which is the time
 
04:26:54.889 --> 04:26:54.899 align:start position:0%
we'll feel the full impact of all of
 
04:26:58.849 --> 04:26:58.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:01.610 --> 04:27:01.620 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions
 
04:27:03.950 --> 04:27:03.960 align:start position:0%
any questions from anyone
 
04:27:06.649 --> 04:27:06.659 align:start position:0%
any hands up
 
04:27:09.410 --> 04:27:09.420 align:start position:0%
okay thank you I'm sure we'll be talking
 
04:27:11.750 --> 04:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
to you both more about this as we
 
04:27:14.570 --> 04:27:14.580 align:start position:0%
proceed forward on this oops I think
 
04:27:16.910 --> 04:27:16.920 align:start position:0%
representative Almy has a question I
 
04:27:19.729 --> 04:27:19.739 align:start position:0%
can't see hands warm okay sorry I need
 
04:27:23.210 --> 04:27:23.220 align:start position:0%
uh Jenny I need your help on that so so
 
04:27:26.210 --> 04:27:26.220 align:start position:0%
remember I mean yep
 
04:27:30.710 --> 04:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Melissa thank you Mr chairman
 
04:27:33.530 --> 04:27:33.540 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming we're starting with fiscal
 
04:27:36.410 --> 04:27:36.420 align:start position:0%
year 20 which
 
04:27:36.420 --> 04:27:37.910 align:start position:0%
year 20 which
is

04:27:37.910 --> 04:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:27:41.510 --> 04:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
probably going to be our lowest but it
 
04:27:43.550 --> 04:27:43.560 align:start position:0%
may be our second lowest Suite it won't
 
04:27:47.769 --> 04:27:47.779 align:start position:0%
know until April on on Revenue
 
04:27:55.910 --> 04:27:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:58.729 --> 04:27:58.739 align:start position:0%
so it really is how much we actually
 
04:28:01.910 --> 04:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
lose from this is going to depend on how
 
04:28:06.229 --> 04:28:06.239 align:start position:0%
much revenue we get from uh the re
 
04:28:08.750 --> 04:28:08.760 align:start position:0%
rebound from the
 
04:28:13.070 --> 04:28:13.080 align:start position:0%
on recession though that in the past has
 
04:28:15.290 --> 04:28:15.300 align:start position:0%
always been slower in New Hampshire than
 
04:28:18.670 --> 04:28:18.680 align:start position:0%
elsewhere uh what I was
 
04:28:22.490 --> 04:28:22.500 align:start position:0%
asking for other than why we started in
 
04:28:22.500 --> 04:28:23.870 align:start position:0%
asking for other than why we started in
20.

04:28:23.870 --> 04:28:23.880 align:start position:0%
20.
 
04:28:27.729 --> 04:28:27.739 align:start position:0%
um is you're using for this whole thing
 
04:28:32.750 --> 04:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
the division of bet from BPT according
 
04:28:37.130 --> 04:28:37.140 align:start position:0%
to the 37 percent that it was in 20 on
 
04:28:40.790 --> 04:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
but we know that we hope that a lot of
 
04:28:43.429 --> 04:28:43.439 align:start position:0%
that is going to change again towards
 
04:28:45.950 --> 04:28:45.960 align:start position:0%
the 40 percent that you always use as
 
04:28:48.349 --> 04:28:48.359 align:start position:0%
the general number
 
04:28:49.910 --> 04:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
um once
 
04:28:52.490 --> 04:28:52.500 align:start position:0%
we are all are vaccinated for coven
 
04:28:54.110 --> 04:28:54.120 align:start position:0%
which in my case is going to be a long
 
04:28:54.120 --> 04:28:55.269 align:start position:0%
which in my case is going to be a long
time

04:28:55.269 --> 04:28:55.279 align:start position:0%
time
 
04:28:59.090 --> 04:28:59.100 align:start position:0%
and uh could go back to restaurants and
 
04:29:00.769 --> 04:29:00.779 align:start position:0%
the restaurants could start opening
 
04:29:00.779 --> 04:29:01.670 align:start position:0%
the restaurants could start opening
again

04:29:01.670 --> 04:29:01.680 align:start position:0%
again
 
04:29:03.950 --> 04:29:03.960 align:start position:0%
given that they've turned a lot
 
04:29:05.870 --> 04:29:05.880 align:start position:0%
hopefully they're going to come back
 
04:29:09.410 --> 04:29:09.420 align:start position:0%
almost to what they were before so on
 
04:29:12.590 --> 04:29:12.600 align:start position:0%
the BET should be growing back relative
 
04:29:14.750 --> 04:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
to BPT and I'm not sure what that does
 
04:29:17.269 --> 04:29:17.279 align:start position:0%
to your conclusions
 
04:29:18.530 --> 04:29:18.540 align:start position:0%
yeah but that's a great Point
 
04:29:21.050 --> 04:29:21.060 align:start position:0%
representative elmy we do always try to
 
04:29:23.809 --> 04:29:23.819 align:start position:0%
put in a little note to say if the
 
04:29:25.429 --> 04:29:25.439 align:start position:0%
starting point of our revenue is
 
04:29:27.590 --> 04:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
adjusted then our Revenue impact will be
 
04:29:31.429 --> 04:29:31.439 align:start position:0%
off it's very hard we did we did do this
 
04:29:34.370 --> 04:29:34.380 align:start position:0%
um these fiscal impacts at the end of
 
04:29:36.469 --> 04:29:36.479 align:start position:0%
fiscal year excuse me at the end of
 
04:29:38.870 --> 04:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
December beginning of November so we
 
04:29:40.370 --> 04:29:40.380 align:start position:0%
weren't exactly sure where fiscal year
 
04:29:43.250 --> 04:29:43.260 align:start position:0%
21 was going to end and because of covid
 
04:29:45.830 --> 04:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
it made it really hard to say let's use
 
04:29:47.750 --> 04:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 21 plan because we weren't
 
04:29:49.370 --> 04:29:49.380 align:start position:0%
we weren't sure at that time if we were
 
04:29:51.590 --> 04:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
even going to meet plan or not so our
 
04:29:53.809 --> 04:29:53.819 align:start position:0%
safest gas at that point was to use
 
04:29:55.849 --> 04:29:55.859 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 20. so obviously if the
 
04:29:58.550 --> 04:29:58.560 align:start position:0%
revenues increase or if that split does
 
04:30:01.250 --> 04:30:01.260 align:start position:0%
change between the BET and BP team there
 
04:30:03.229 --> 04:30:03.239 align:start position:0%
will be some impacts however I'm not
 
04:30:06.050 --> 04:30:06.060 align:start position:0%
sure if it will be a drastically impact
 
04:30:08.689 --> 04:30:08.699 align:start position:0%
just because of the Back Credit against
 
04:30:12.649 --> 04:30:12.659 align:start position:0%
the BPT might offset that a little bit
 
04:30:15.110 --> 04:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
all right I was wondering if we could
 
04:30:17.750 --> 04:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
possibly get just one sensitivity
 
04:30:20.870 --> 04:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
analysis on that
 
04:30:23.870 --> 04:30:23.880 align:start position:0%
for this this group and we've we've
 
04:30:28.250 --> 04:30:28.260 align:start position:0%
never really looked at the impact of of
 
04:30:29.830 --> 04:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
the bet
 
04:30:34.490 --> 04:30:34.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:36.050 --> 04:30:36.060 align:start position:0%
it's wrong with you you want to respond
 
04:30:37.250 --> 04:30:37.260 align:start position:0%
to that
 
04:30:39.769 --> 04:30:39.779 align:start position:0%
sure we can we can look into that and
 
04:30:41.389 --> 04:30:41.399 align:start position:0%
see if we can come up with
 
04:30:43.429 --> 04:30:43.439 align:start position:0%
um see if we can come up with a
 
04:30:45.469 --> 04:30:45.479 align:start position:0%
sensitivity analysis to see how much it
 
04:30:47.269 --> 04:30:47.279 align:start position:0%
does impact it or not we can absolutely
 
04:30:49.550 --> 04:30:49.560 align:start position:0%
take a look at that so so for all the
 
04:30:51.410 --> 04:30:51.420 align:start position:0%
members you know we're going to get into
 
04:30:53.090 --> 04:30:53.100 align:start position:0%
the weeds with Barbara view on this one
 
04:30:56.090 --> 04:30:56.100 align:start position:0%
so uh you know these people when we do
 
04:30:57.769 --> 04:30:57.779 align:start position:0%
our work sessions I'm sure we're gonna
 
04:31:00.410 --> 04:31:00.420 align:start position:0%
we're gonna dig into this so
 
04:31:04.130 --> 04:31:04.140 align:start position:0%
so any other questions for uh Melissa
 
04:31:04.140 --> 04:31:05.030 align:start position:0%
so any other questions for uh Melissa
Rollins

04:31:05.030 --> 04:31:05.040 align:start position:0%
Rollins
 
04:31:09.229 --> 04:31:09.239 align:start position:0%
no okay thank you Melissa thank you
 
04:31:10.969 --> 04:31:10.979 align:start position:0%
um I want to apologize to representative
 
04:31:12.769 --> 04:31:12.779 align:start position:0%
Harrigan uh protocol is that
 
04:31:16.250 --> 04:31:16.260 align:start position:0%
Representatives go before others so I'm
 
04:31:18.229 --> 04:31:18.239 align:start position:0%
going to call on representative Oregon
 
04:31:20.149 --> 04:31:20.159 align:start position:0%
if you're still there well I'm still
 
04:31:20.159 --> 04:31:21.110 align:start position:0%
if you're still there well I'm still
there

04:31:21.110 --> 04:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:31:22.790 --> 04:31:22.800 align:start position:0%
I just start speaking now or do you want
 
04:31:24.469 --> 04:31:24.479 align:start position:0%
to add me to the panel I'm happy either
 
04:31:26.450 --> 04:31:26.460 align:start position:0%
way you're not missing much by not being
 
04:31:28.670 --> 04:31:28.680 align:start position:0%
able to see me the representative we
 
04:31:30.170 --> 04:31:30.180 align:start position:0%
can't hear you okay thank you very much
 
04:31:31.370 --> 04:31:31.380 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
04:31:31.380 --> 04:31:32.030 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
um

04:31:32.030 --> 04:31:32.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:31:34.429 --> 04:31:34.439 align:start position:0%
so I guess so you well this is I guess
 
04:31:36.830 --> 04:31:36.840 align:start position:0%
right now I'm uh an attendee but I'm I'm
 
04:31:38.450 --> 04:31:38.460 align:start position:0%
able to speak that's good enough you
 
04:31:39.769 --> 04:31:39.779 align:start position:0%
won't be able to see me probably but
 
04:31:42.769 --> 04:31:42.779 align:start position:0%
you're not missing much um so I'm in
 
04:31:45.469 --> 04:31:45.479 align:start position:0%
opposition uh opposition to this bill I
 
04:31:47.689 --> 04:31:47.699 align:start position:0%
think um I think it would do nothing but
 
04:31:49.309 --> 04:31:49.319 align:start position:0%
reduce the amount of Revenue coming into
 
04:31:51.110 --> 04:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
the state and um
 
04:31:53.210 --> 04:31:53.220 align:start position:0%
both the speaker and representative
 
04:31:55.250 --> 04:31:55.260 align:start position:0%
major made what are what many of you
 
04:31:57.469 --> 04:31:57.479 align:start position:0%
recognize as Laffer Curve Arguments for
 
04:32:00.170 --> 04:32:00.180 align:start position:0%
the tax cuts which is supposedly when
 
04:32:03.229 --> 04:32:03.239 align:start position:0%
you cut taxes business activity will go
 
04:32:04.969 --> 04:32:04.979 align:start position:0%
up so much you'll get the same revenue
 
04:32:07.790 --> 04:32:07.800 align:start position:0%
or more that's
 
04:32:09.950 --> 04:32:09.960 align:start position:0%
an unrealistic assumption I actually
 
04:32:12.769 --> 04:32:12.779 align:start position:0%
studied economics with Dr Laffer and I
 
04:32:14.269 --> 04:32:14.279 align:start position:0%
don't know whether he would have been
 
04:32:15.769 --> 04:32:15.779 align:start position:0%
opposed or in favor of this bill he
 
04:32:16.670 --> 04:32:16.680 align:start position:0%
actually probably would have been more
 
04:32:18.950 --> 04:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
likely in favor but
 
04:32:20.830 --> 04:32:20.840 align:start position:0%
um first of all the rates to which that
 
04:32:23.990 --> 04:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
kicks in are much higher than um higher
 
04:32:26.269 --> 04:32:26.279 align:start position:0%
than what the rate of our business taxes
 
04:32:27.710 --> 04:32:27.720 align:start position:0%
and business profits have been an
 
04:32:30.110 --> 04:32:30.120 align:start position:0%
Enterprise tax so the inflection point
 
04:32:31.729 --> 04:32:31.739 align:start position:0%
on that curve where you start losing
 
04:32:34.250 --> 04:32:34.260 align:start position:0%
money raise taxes is for most types of
 
04:32:36.110 --> 04:32:36.120 align:start position:0%
taxes weigh up around 90 you know we're
 
04:32:37.870 --> 04:32:37.880 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
04:32:40.729 --> 04:32:40.739 align:start position:0%
0.55 percent of something the business
 
04:32:43.070 --> 04:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
profits tax versus just on profits which
 
04:32:44.870 --> 04:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
is just part of what business has taken
 
04:32:48.410 --> 04:32:48.420 align:start position:0%
you know it's whatever seven seven point
 
04:32:49.910 --> 04:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
seven percent now
 
04:32:52.309 --> 04:32:52.319 align:start position:0%
um the business Enterprise tax which
 
04:32:54.349 --> 04:32:54.359 align:start position:0%
it's kind of like an income tax
 
04:32:57.649 --> 04:32:57.659 align:start position:0%
but it's paid by the employer not by the
 
04:33:00.050 --> 04:33:00.060 align:start position:0%
employee and it's not every employer and
 
04:33:02.090 --> 04:33:02.100 align:start position:0%
every employee so I guess that makes it
 
04:33:03.769 --> 04:33:03.779 align:start position:0%
narrow enough not to be a broad-based
 
04:33:06.109 --> 04:33:06.119 align:start position:0%
income tax but it works very much like
 
04:33:08.209 --> 04:33:08.219 align:start position:0%
the income tax of everybody who works
 
04:33:10.250 --> 04:33:10.260 align:start position:0%
for a covered um thing that's
 
04:33:13.250 --> 04:33:13.260 align:start position:0%
0.6 percent and I think these are also
 
04:33:15.470 --> 04:33:15.480 align:start position:0%
the Laffer Curve effect you know supply
 
04:33:18.769 --> 04:33:18.779 align:start position:0%
side effect depiction only when the uh
 
04:33:21.470 --> 04:33:21.480 align:start position:0%
when only only when there's a
 
04:33:23.510 --> 04:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
significant change when there's also
 
04:33:25.369 --> 04:33:25.379 align:start position:0%
there's structural because they can kick
 
04:33:27.470 --> 04:33:27.480 align:start position:0%
in and also people have to be confident
 
04:33:29.029 --> 04:33:29.039 align:start position:0%
it's going to stick around and none of
 
04:33:30.490 --> 04:33:30.500 align:start position:0%
these apply to this you could probably
 
04:33:32.330 --> 04:33:32.340 align:start position:0%
totally eliminate the business
 
04:33:34.131 --> 04:33:34.141 align:start position:0%
Enterprise tax and you do nothing but
 
04:33:35.810 --> 04:33:35.820 align:start position:0%
lose all that Revenue I think that would
 
04:33:38.150 --> 04:33:38.160 align:start position:0%
probably have little or no effect on
 
04:33:41.090 --> 04:33:41.100 align:start position:0%
businesses on this also growth in
 
04:33:43.490 --> 04:33:43.500 align:start position:0%
business it um relies a lot more than
 
04:33:47.090 --> 04:33:47.100 align:start position:0%
low taxes um you need you need a good
 
04:33:48.830 --> 04:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
government for businesses to grow you
 
04:33:50.810 --> 04:33:50.820 align:start position:0%
need businesses need a Workforce you
 
04:33:52.551 --> 04:33:52.561 align:start position:0%
know they need a Judicial System they
 
04:33:54.230 --> 04:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
need Transportation they need all kinds
 
04:33:55.910 --> 04:33:55.920 align:start position:0%
of things that government pays for so
 
04:33:57.949 --> 04:33:57.959 align:start position:0%
like at least some of what government
 
04:34:00.289 --> 04:34:00.299 align:start position:0%
does it's very beneficial the business
 
04:34:02.449 --> 04:34:02.459 align:start position:0%
community so and also
 
04:34:04.490 --> 04:34:04.500 align:start position:0%
um the government also is a major
 
04:34:07.010 --> 04:34:07.020 align:start position:0%
customer for private business so they're
 
04:34:09.590 --> 04:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
one of the largest uh you know there are
 
04:34:11.570 --> 04:34:11.580 align:start position:0%
many many businesses rely on the
 
04:34:13.670 --> 04:34:13.680 align:start position:0%
government as a as a customer too and of
 
04:34:16.070 --> 04:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
course also government spending we also
 
04:34:17.929 --> 04:34:17.939 align:start position:0%
saw that it's not inherently bad for the
 
04:34:20.090 --> 04:34:20.100 align:start position:0%
economy when we had essentially
 
04:34:23.029 --> 04:34:23.039 align:start position:0%
1.25 billion dollars of free
 
04:34:25.369 --> 04:34:25.379 align:start position:0%
virtually free Federal money was dumped
 
04:34:27.349 --> 04:34:27.359 align:start position:0%
on us you know government spending
 
04:34:29.869 --> 04:34:29.879 align:start position:0%
um government spend it all and um
 
04:34:32.390 --> 04:34:32.400 align:start position:0%
economy improved as a result so it
 
04:34:32.400 --> 04:34:34.510 align:start position:0%
economy improved as a result so it
perfect

04:34:34.510 --> 04:34:34.520 align:start position:0%
perfect
 
04:34:37.609 --> 04:34:37.619 align:start position:0%
we're really running behind uh yes my
 
04:34:39.830 --> 04:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
last comment is um thank you last
 
04:34:41.869 --> 04:34:41.879 align:start position:0%
comment is
 
04:34:41.879 --> 04:34:42.650 align:start position:0%
comment is
um

04:34:42.650 --> 04:34:42.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:44.449 --> 04:34:44.459 align:start position:0%
these tax cuts are the way they are
 
04:34:46.551 --> 04:34:46.561 align:start position:0%
because and it's been in there for
 
04:34:48.170 --> 04:34:48.180 align:start position:0%
several budget Cycles I think dating
 
04:34:51.170 --> 04:34:51.180 align:start position:0%
back to the 2015 budget and uh
 
04:34:53.631 --> 04:34:53.641 align:start position:0%
so there was a possibility the tax rate
 
04:34:55.670 --> 04:34:55.680 align:start position:0%
could go up if economy shrank and it
 
04:34:58.789 --> 04:34:58.799 align:start position:0%
never shrank until uh the pandemic
 
04:35:00.230 --> 04:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
happened so we had an unexpected
 
04:35:02.150 --> 04:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
catastrophe so it actually
 
04:35:03.830 --> 04:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
shrank released prior to the year so
 
04:35:06.410 --> 04:35:06.420 align:start position:0%
that was the first time impact increase
 
04:35:08.269 --> 04:35:08.279 align:start position:0%
through these the way these trigger this
 
04:35:09.410 --> 04:35:09.420 align:start position:0%
law is written
 
04:35:12.769 --> 04:35:12.779 align:start position:0%
it could even happen and um it was uh
 
04:35:14.750 --> 04:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
you know effective the amount that it
 
04:35:16.310 --> 04:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
goes up would have gone up is very
 
04:35:17.810 --> 04:35:17.820 align:start position:0%
exaggerated I remember even back then we
 
04:35:19.609 --> 04:35:19.619 align:start position:0%
had the budget briefing I asked Neil
 
04:35:19.619 --> 04:35:20.750 align:start position:0%
had the budget briefing I asked Neil
Kirk

04:35:20.750 --> 04:35:20.760 align:start position:0%
Kirk
 
04:35:22.010 --> 04:35:22.020 align:start position:0%
um this looks like
 
04:35:24.410 --> 04:35:24.420 align:start position:0%
tax rate could actually go up under
 
04:35:25.970 --> 04:35:25.980 align:start position:0%
certain circumstances my friends would
 
04:35:27.949 --> 04:35:27.959 align:start position:0%
be really amazed at such that he would
 
04:35:30.709 --> 04:35:30.719 align:start position:0%
consider such a thing and he assured me
 
04:35:33.051 --> 04:35:33.061 align:start position:0%
and there's a reasonable answer that
 
04:35:34.970 --> 04:35:34.980 align:start position:0%
that would be virtually impossible but
 
04:35:36.890 --> 04:35:36.900 align:start position:0%
then last year many things that are
 
04:35:38.209 --> 04:35:38.219 align:start position:0%
virtually impossible actually happened
 
04:35:40.609 --> 04:35:40.619 align:start position:0%
and one of them was that uh
 
04:35:43.670 --> 04:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
these triggers that these uh you know
 
04:35:45.349 --> 04:35:45.359 align:start position:0%
the economy shrank enough to trigger a
 
04:35:47.209 --> 04:35:47.219 align:start position:0%
possible tax increase so anyway I think
 
04:35:47.219 --> 04:35:48.349 align:start position:0%
possible tax increase so anyway I think
uh

04:35:48.349 --> 04:35:48.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:35:49.551 --> 04:35:49.561 align:start position:0%
you know you'll have plenty of work
 
04:35:51.830 --> 04:35:51.840 align:start position:0%
sessions and I'm I know a lot less about
 
04:35:53.869 --> 04:35:53.879 align:start position:0%
this than the uh the committee and
 
04:35:55.189 --> 04:35:55.199 align:start position:0%
you'll have plenty of Works Essence a
 
04:35:57.830 --> 04:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
wide variety of sessions but I think
 
04:36:00.109 --> 04:36:00.119 align:start position:0%
I think this bill is a bad Bill I think
 
04:36:03.470 --> 04:36:03.480 align:start position:0%
it will do nothing except uh just lower
 
04:36:06.349 --> 04:36:06.359 align:start position:0%
the revenue and we'd either have to uh
 
04:36:08.029 --> 04:36:08.039 align:start position:0%
thank you very much we had to get it
 
04:36:09.349 --> 04:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
somewhere else so that's that's why I'm
 
04:36:10.910 --> 04:36:10.920 align:start position:0%
opposed to it so thank you very much
 
04:36:12.230 --> 04:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
Horrigan any questions for
 
04:36:14.029 --> 04:36:14.039 align:start position:0%
representative Horgan I would first off
 
04:36:15.890 --> 04:36:15.900 align:start position:0%
do willing to take questions sure yes
 
04:36:19.609 --> 04:36:19.619 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:21.529 --> 04:36:21.539 align:start position:0%
no thank you thank you very much thanks
 
04:36:23.990 --> 04:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
a lot thanks okay
 
04:36:27.170 --> 04:36:27.180 align:start position:0%
um we have two more that will uh I'm

waiting for the next meeting uh the next
 
04:36:36.650 --> 04:36:36.660 align:start position:0%
meeting the next is uh house bill 15.
 
04:36:38.390 --> 04:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
will probably be another 10 or 15
 
04:36:40.490 --> 04:36:40.500 align:start position:0%
minutes on this on this bill so just
 
04:36:41.929 --> 04:36:41.939 align:start position:0%
hang in there please

04:37:02.510 --> 04:37:02.520 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman members of committee on I'm
 
04:37:04.551 --> 04:37:04.561 align:start position:0%
I'm glad I'm more punctual for this uh
 
04:37:06.349 --> 04:37:06.359 align:start position:0%
hearing than for the one this morning so
 
04:37:08.750 --> 04:37:08.760 align:start position:0%
so I appreciate your patience with that
 
04:37:11.390 --> 04:37:11.400 align:start position:0%
uh as you may know I'm Greg Moore I'm
 
04:37:12.890 --> 04:37:12.900 align:start position:0%
the state director with Americans for
 
04:37:15.890 --> 04:37:15.900 align:start position:0%
Prosperity here in New Hampshire and so
 
04:37:17.810 --> 04:37:17.820 align:start position:0%
the veteran members of the committee you
 
04:37:19.910 --> 04:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
know that we have long been proponents
 
04:37:21.830 --> 04:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
for reducing the states to business
 
04:37:25.310 --> 04:37:25.320 align:start position:0%
primary business taxes and uh we've been
 
04:37:27.289 --> 04:37:27.299 align:start position:0%
involved since this began even before
 
04:37:31.010 --> 04:37:31.020 align:start position:0%
2015 and and we believe that this is as
 
04:37:34.131 --> 04:37:34.141 align:start position:0%
a hugely beneficial opportunity for this
 
04:37:36.369 --> 04:37:36.379 align:start position:0%
day to grow our economy uh
 
04:37:38.510 --> 04:37:38.520 align:start position:0%
representative major did a great job of
 
04:37:40.970 --> 04:37:40.980 align:start position:0%
outlining how even with lower rates the
 
04:37:42.590 --> 04:37:42.600 align:start position:0%
state was seeing record business tax
 
04:37:45.769 --> 04:37:45.779 align:start position:0%
revenues and I think it's important to
 
04:37:48.051 --> 04:37:48.061 align:start position:0%
look Beyond just the impact on revenues
 
04:37:49.670 --> 04:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
I know that's this committee's purview
 
04:37:52.070 --> 04:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
but to look beyond the impact of Revenue
 
04:37:53.929 --> 04:37:53.939 align:start position:0%
and look at the other economic factors
 
04:37:55.670 --> 04:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
and and the impact that's having on the
 
04:37:58.189 --> 04:37:58.199 align:start position:0%
lives of people across the state we saw
 
04:38:00.949 --> 04:38:00.959 align:start position:0%
a tremendous job growth wage growth we
 
04:38:02.810 --> 04:38:02.820 align:start position:0%
had a Workforce participation number
 
04:38:05.570 --> 04:38:05.580 align:start position:0%
that was uh in the top five nationally
 
04:38:08.750 --> 04:38:08.760 align:start position:0%
prior to the pandemic and and that's
 
04:38:10.010 --> 04:38:10.020 align:start position:0%
great we had
 
04:38:14.330 --> 04:38:14.340 align:start position:0%
um 72 percent pushing 73 of of uh the
 
04:38:16.730 --> 04:38:16.740 align:start position:0%
people in the work people in the
 
04:38:18.410 --> 04:38:18.420 align:start position:0%
workforce age were actually engaged in
 
04:38:19.849 --> 04:38:19.859 align:start position:0%
work which is which is absolutely
 
04:38:22.010 --> 04:38:22.020 align:start position:0%
fantastic and I would submit to you that
 
04:38:25.429 --> 04:38:25.439 align:start position:0%
the the the track of the growth in our
 
04:38:27.769 --> 04:38:27.779 align:start position:0%
Workforce participation number uh
 
04:38:30.230 --> 04:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
aligned pretty closely with with the
 
04:38:32.869 --> 04:38:32.879 align:start position:0%
business tax reductions we started in 20
 
04:38:35.029 --> 04:38:35.039 align:start position:0%
in the 2015 budget that actually began
 
04:38:38.330 --> 04:38:38.340 align:start position:0%
January 1st of 2016. and these benefits
 
04:38:40.310 --> 04:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
come as a result of just becoming more
 
04:38:42.590 --> 04:38:42.600 align:start position:0%
competitive through the three rounds of
 
04:38:44.029 --> 04:38:44.039 align:start position:0%
tax relief we have now lowered our
 
04:38:45.830 --> 04:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
corporate profits tax below that of
 
04:38:48.470 --> 04:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and we're now better
 
04:38:50.330 --> 04:38:50.340 align:start position:0%
positioned regionally with our business
 
04:38:52.730 --> 04:38:52.740 align:start position:0%
tax environment to compete for those for
 
04:38:54.230 --> 04:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
those employers to come to New Hampshire
 
04:38:56.510 --> 04:38:56.520 align:start position:0%
or to have existing employers grow here
 
04:38:58.609 --> 04:38:58.619 align:start position:0%
and I think that's an important factor
 
04:39:00.709 --> 04:39:00.719 align:start position:0%
to keep in mind that making sure that we
 
04:39:02.689 --> 04:39:02.699 align:start position:0%
have good jobs particularly as we come
 
04:39:04.490 --> 04:39:04.500 align:start position:0%
out of a pandemic this is going to be
 
04:39:06.289 --> 04:39:06.299 align:start position:0%
critical over the long term House Bill
 
04:39:07.970 --> 04:39:07.980 align:start position:0%
10 would continue to expand that
 
04:39:10.609 --> 04:39:10.619 align:start position:0%
Advantage with a particular focus on
 
04:39:12.769 --> 04:39:12.779 align:start position:0%
small businesses because of the nature
 
04:39:15.230 --> 04:39:15.240 align:start position:0%
of the the focus of this one the first
 
04:39:16.849 --> 04:39:16.859 align:start position:0%
two rounds the ones that were included
 
04:39:18.730 --> 04:39:18.740 align:start position:0%
in the 2015 budget really were
 
04:39:22.070 --> 04:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
emphasizing the business profits tax uh
 
04:39:24.170 --> 04:39:24.180 align:start position:0%
the the two rounds that were included in
 
04:39:27.590 --> 04:39:27.600 align:start position:0%
the 2017 budget which of which this bill
 
04:39:29.390 --> 04:39:29.400 align:start position:0%
would actually finally Implement that
 
04:39:32.449 --> 04:39:32.459 align:start position:0%
fourth round over two years we'll really
 
04:39:33.830 --> 04:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
focus more on the business Enterprise
 
04:39:36.470 --> 04:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
tax which as this committee knows truly
 
04:39:38.810 --> 04:39:38.820 align:start position:0%
benefits to small businesses that have
 
04:39:41.750 --> 04:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
been ravaged so dramatically uh and
 
04:39:44.330 --> 04:39:44.340 align:start position:0%
through as a result of the pandemic uh
 
04:39:45.470 --> 04:39:45.480 align:start position:0%
there's one other thing I want to point
 
04:39:47.330 --> 04:39:47.340 align:start position:0%
out I know that one of the things we
 
04:39:48.890 --> 04:39:48.900 align:start position:0%
talk about is revenue but it's important
 
04:39:50.630 --> 04:39:50.640 align:start position:0%
as we're talking about Revenue to sort
 
04:39:52.310 --> 04:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
of look at some of the changes in the
 
04:39:54.590 --> 04:39:54.600 align:start position:0%
last legislature looking at the Surplus
 
04:39:56.810 --> 04:39:56.820 align:start position:0%
statement that was attached with with
 
04:39:58.610 --> 04:39:58.620 align:start position:0%
the last budget house bills three and
 
04:40:01.490 --> 04:40:01.500 align:start position:0%
four from 2019 one of the things we note
 
04:40:03.288 --> 04:40:03.298 align:start position:0%
is just by going through that Surplus
 
04:40:06.650 --> 04:40:06.660 align:start position:0%
statement tax law changes as a result of
 
04:40:09.190 --> 04:40:09.200 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 190 and House Bill 4
 
04:40:12.050 --> 04:40:12.060 align:start position:0%
resulted in at least estimated but at
 
04:40:15.350 --> 04:40:15.360 align:start position:0%
the time 41 41 and a quarter million
 
04:40:17.208 --> 04:40:17.218 align:start position:0%
dollars in tax increases on businesses
 
04:40:20.330 --> 04:40:20.340 align:start position:0%
and that's that's a result of changing
 
04:40:22.190 --> 04:40:22.200 align:start position:0%
things on reinforcement reinforcement
 
04:40:24.890 --> 04:40:24.900 align:start position:0%
and Conformity as well as taxing of
 
04:40:27.470 --> 04:40:27.480 align:start position:0%
global investment low tax income or GI
 
04:40:32.030 --> 04:40:32.040 align:start position:0%
LTI uh now I'll say the the policy
 
04:40:34.130 --> 04:40:34.140 align:start position:0%
changes the policy changes that took
 
04:40:36.410 --> 04:40:36.420 align:start position:0%
place through reapportionment the policy
 
04:40:38.270 --> 04:40:38.280 align:start position:0%
changes that took place as a result of
 
04:40:40.730 --> 04:40:40.740 align:start position:0%
Conformity they stand up on their own
 
04:40:43.010 --> 04:40:43.020 align:start position:0%
those policy changes make sense made
 
04:40:44.868 --> 04:40:44.878 align:start position:0%
sense on their own however as you
 
04:40:46.670 --> 04:40:46.680 align:start position:0%
broaden that base it's also important to
 
04:40:49.190 --> 04:40:49.200 align:start position:0%
to reduce rates and the way I view it
 
04:40:51.050 --> 04:40:51.060 align:start position:0%
that the changes that are included in
 
04:40:52.490 --> 04:40:52.500 align:start position:0%
House Bill 10
 
04:40:52.500 --> 04:40:53.590 align:start position:0%
House Bill 10
do

04:40:53.590 --> 04:40:53.600 align:start position:0%
do
 
04:40:57.230 --> 04:40:57.240 align:start position:0%
follow up to the tax law changes in in
 
04:40:59.570 --> 04:40:59.580 align:start position:0%
the last legislature to basically get
 
04:41:02.150 --> 04:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
business back to even and that and again
 
04:41:04.310 --> 04:41:04.320 align:start position:0%
we are fully supportive of the idea of
 
04:41:07.190 --> 04:41:07.200 align:start position:0%
Broad and base and lower rates so with
 
04:41:09.830 --> 04:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
that in mind uh we stand fully
 
04:41:11.690 --> 04:41:11.700 align:start position:0%
supportive of House Bill 10 and I'd be
 
04:41:12.890 --> 04:41:12.900 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions from the
 
04:41:12.900 --> 04:41:14.208 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions from the
committee

04:41:14.208 --> 04:41:14.218 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:41:16.970 --> 04:41:16.980 align:start position:0%
next question
 
04:41:16.980 --> 04:41:19.670 align:start position:0%
next question
um

04:41:19.670 --> 04:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:22.070 --> 04:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Vice chair uh and
 
04:41:24.230 --> 04:41:24.240 align:start position:0%
representative Nunez I'm sorry thank you
 
04:41:24.240 --> 04:41:25.430 align:start position:0%
representative Nunez I'm sorry thank you
Mr

04:41:25.430 --> 04:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
04:41:27.230 --> 04:41:27.240 align:start position:0%
chair thank you Mr Moore for testifying
 
04:41:29.150 --> 04:41:29.160 align:start position:0%
to us today it's good to see you on a
 
04:41:30.170 --> 04:41:30.180 align:start position:0%
screen even though it's just your
 
04:41:30.180 --> 04:41:31.490 align:start position:0%
screen even though it's just your
picture

04:41:31.490 --> 04:41:31.500 align:start position:0%
picture
 
04:41:33.650 --> 04:41:33.660 align:start position:0%
um uh when we talk about economic
 
04:41:37.190 --> 04:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
downturns I think that we all need could
 
04:41:44.990 --> 04:41:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:47.150 --> 04:41:47.160 align:start position:0%
you want me to take down my mask is that
 
04:41:47.160 --> 04:41:48.110 align:start position:0%
you want me to take down my mask is that
better

04:41:48.110 --> 04:41:48.120 align:start position:0%
better
 
04:41:50.930 --> 04:41:50.940 align:start position:0%
it's better I couldn't hear before thank
 
04:41:52.788 --> 04:41:52.798 align:start position:0%
you so much and thank you for letting me
 
04:41:54.230 --> 04:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
know that because I certainly want to be
 
04:41:56.150 --> 04:41:56.160 align:start position:0%
heard uh Mr Moore when we talk about
 
04:41:58.910 --> 04:41:58.920 align:start position:0%
economic economic downturns
 
04:42:00.410 --> 04:42:00.420 align:start position:0%
um I think sometimes that we forget that
 
04:42:01.670 --> 04:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
there are different there are different
 
04:42:03.590 --> 04:42:03.600 align:start position:0%
levels of economic downturns some of
 
04:42:06.250 --> 04:42:06.260 align:start position:0%
that is is a lack of consumer confidence
 
04:42:09.410 --> 04:42:09.420 align:start position:0%
sometimes it is bad Planning by the feds
 
04:42:11.690 --> 04:42:11.700 align:start position:0%
and sometimes it's about bad policy
 
04:42:13.730 --> 04:42:13.740 align:start position:0%
introduction to the state level I think
 
04:42:16.970 --> 04:42:16.980 align:start position:0%
that when we compare 2020
 
04:42:20.628 --> 04:42:20.638 align:start position:0%
to other years a pandemic hit in 2020
 
04:42:22.550 --> 04:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
and I don't think it's fair for us to
 
04:42:26.150 --> 04:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
judge in 2020 but for us to look back in
 
04:42:28.190 --> 04:42:28.200 align:start position:0%
the past and look at the growth that
 
04:42:30.170 --> 04:42:30.180 align:start position:0%
we've had from reduction in business
 
04:42:32.990 --> 04:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
taxes uh Mr Moore can you touch a little
 
04:42:36.050 --> 04:42:36.060 align:start position:0%
bit more on the growth that we had over
 
04:42:37.970 --> 04:42:37.980 align:start position:0%
the past several years before the
 
04:42:40.550 --> 04:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
pandemic and looking at our unemployment
 
04:42:43.010 --> 04:42:43.020 align:start position:0%
rate and where we're going right now and
 
04:42:44.690 --> 04:42:44.700 align:start position:0%
the possibility for businesses to be
 
04:42:46.970 --> 04:42:46.980 align:start position:0%
coming open again as they are in
 
04:42:48.830 --> 04:42:48.840 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and other areas that are
 
04:42:50.750 --> 04:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
opening up their businesses right now I
 
04:42:52.010 --> 04:42:52.020 align:start position:0%
think that we'll be following soon
 
04:42:52.020 --> 04:42:53.448 align:start position:0%
think that we'll be following soon
hopefully

04:42:53.448 --> 04:42:53.458 align:start position:0%
hopefully
 
04:42:54.948 --> 04:42:54.958 align:start position:0%
um can you talk to the level of
 
04:42:56.330 --> 04:42:56.340 align:start position:0%
confidence that we'll have in our
 
04:42:59.288 --> 04:42:59.298 align:start position:0%
economy here in the state and why
 
04:43:03.650 --> 04:43:03.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:07.128 --> 04:43:07.138 align:start position:0%
well at first I'd say uh I I tend to
 
04:43:09.530 --> 04:43:09.540 align:start position:0%
look back at this as as a five-year
 
04:43:11.090 --> 04:43:11.100 align:start position:0%
discussion not necessarily a one-year
 
04:43:11.100 --> 04:43:12.230 align:start position:0%
discussion not necessarily a one-year
discussion

04:43:12.230 --> 04:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
04:43:14.868 --> 04:43:14.878 align:start position:0%
um it's clear that without question what
 
04:43:17.810 --> 04:43:17.820 align:start position:0%
happened what happened last year
 
04:43:19.670 --> 04:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
I think we can all say that none of us
 
04:43:21.170 --> 04:43:21.180 align:start position:0%
hopes that would ever happen again or
 
04:43:23.930 --> 04:43:23.940 align:start position:0%
any time again in a near near term uh
 
04:43:26.270 --> 04:43:26.280 align:start position:0%
but there's no question that as we
 
04:43:28.310 --> 04:43:28.320 align:start position:0%
become more competitive that that gives
 
04:43:31.850 --> 04:43:31.860 align:start position:0%
us an opportunity to go go and make the
 
04:43:33.590 --> 04:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
case to businesses in other states and
 
04:43:36.530 --> 04:43:36.540 align:start position:0%
the folks the folks over at Bea I think
 
04:43:38.270 --> 04:43:38.280 align:start position:0%
do an outstanding job of recruiting
 
04:43:40.850 --> 04:43:40.860 align:start position:0%
these businesses to come here so it's a
 
04:43:43.368 --> 04:43:43.378 align:start position:0%
two-fold part it's it's the the lower
 
04:43:44.570 --> 04:43:44.580 align:start position:0%
taxes particularly in the business
 
04:43:47.628 --> 04:43:47.638 align:start position:0%
Enterprise tax side help our existing
 
04:43:49.910 --> 04:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
small businesses here get back on their
 
04:43:51.890 --> 04:43:51.900 align:start position:0%
feet particularly talking food service
 
04:43:54.830 --> 04:43:54.840 align:start position:0%
and hospitality industry but uh
 
04:43:56.570 --> 04:43:56.580 align:start position:0%
particularly the lowering of the
 
04:43:58.430 --> 04:43:58.440 align:start position:0%
business profits tax is also important
 
04:44:00.470 --> 04:44:00.480 align:start position:0%
even though even though this this
 
04:44:02.448 --> 04:44:02.458 align:start position:0%
particular bill is focused more in the
 
04:44:04.250 --> 04:44:04.260 align:start position:0%
business Enterprise because it allows us
 
04:44:06.410 --> 04:44:06.420 align:start position:0%
to make the case businesses outside of
 
04:44:08.628 --> 04:44:08.638 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire places like Massachusetts
 
04:44:11.030 --> 04:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
places places like all across New
 
04:44:12.830 --> 04:44:12.840 align:start position:0%
England and say this is the place to be
 
04:44:14.448 --> 04:44:14.458 align:start position:0%
this is a place that wants to do
 
04:44:16.368 --> 04:44:16.378 align:start position:0%
business with you and is going to be a
 
04:44:17.868 --> 04:44:17.878 align:start position:0%
partner with you and we're sending a
 
04:44:20.090 --> 04:44:20.100 align:start position:0%
clear Direction by saying that we are
 
04:44:22.670 --> 04:44:22.680 align:start position:0%
going to continue a pro-growth economic
 
04:44:24.650 --> 04:44:24.660 align:start position:0%
policy that that we're going to be on
 
04:44:26.270 --> 04:44:26.280 align:start position:0%
your side and that's I think right now
 
04:44:27.650 --> 04:44:27.660 align:start position:0%
and I think particularly coming out of
 
04:44:29.628 --> 04:44:29.638 align:start position:0%
this pandemic what I think a lot of
 
04:44:31.910 --> 04:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
employers want to hear that's that's
 
04:44:33.350 --> 04:44:33.360 align:start position:0%
exactly the message we want to be
 
04:44:36.590 --> 04:44:36.600 align:start position:0%
sending so so I think it's critical and
 
04:44:38.628 --> 04:44:38.638 align:start position:0%
it's critical for us to keep sending
 
04:44:41.510 --> 04:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
these positive positive messages to uh
 
04:44:43.010 --> 04:44:43.020 align:start position:0%
to the community business Community to
 
04:44:44.510 --> 04:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
say we we're going to be with you we're
 
04:44:46.430 --> 04:44:46.440 align:start position:0%
going to we understand that it's you're
 
04:44:48.350 --> 04:44:48.360 align:start position:0%
going through some tough times and even
 
04:44:49.730 --> 04:44:49.740 align:start position:0%
even if some businesses who haven't
 
04:44:52.250 --> 04:44:52.260 align:start position:0%
never been negatively impacted we want
 
04:44:54.170 --> 04:44:54.180 align:start position:0%
to say we're the place that one wants to
 
04:44:55.970 --> 04:44:55.980 align:start position:0%
work with you and wants to have you come
 
04:44:58.128 --> 04:44:58.138 align:start position:0%
and be here and be part of our economy
 
04:45:00.530 --> 04:45:00.540 align:start position:0%
so I think that that the message is this
 
04:45:03.350 --> 04:45:03.360 align:start position:0%
sense directionally is also critical as
 
04:45:03.360 --> 04:45:08.350 align:start position:0%
sense directionally is also critical as
well

04:45:08.350 --> 04:45:08.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:14.570 --> 04:45:14.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:18.170 --> 04:45:18.180 align:start position:0%
uh excuse me representative Rory
 
04:45:21.830 --> 04:45:21.840 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair uh Mr Moore uh the
 
04:45:23.868 --> 04:45:23.878 align:start position:0%
same question I asked earlier about a
 
04:45:26.330 --> 04:45:26.340 align:start position:0%
historical analysis uh you and I have
 
04:45:29.208 --> 04:45:29.218 align:start position:0%
both attended conferences with um Dr
 
04:45:31.550 --> 04:45:31.560 align:start position:0%
Laffer who
 
04:45:35.990 --> 04:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
is funny or Economist is funny but
 
04:45:36.000 --> 04:45:36.708 align:start position:0%
is funny or Economist is funny but
um

04:45:36.708 --> 04:45:36.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:45:39.948 --> 04:45:39.958 align:start position:0%
excuse me but at any rate Tom do you
 
04:45:42.230 --> 04:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
have any information from AFP regarding
 
04:45:46.128 --> 04:45:46.138 align:start position:0%
the uh practical effect of reducing
 
04:45:49.550 --> 04:45:49.560 align:start position:0%
um uh uh taxes and their and increasing
 
04:45:52.788 --> 04:45:52.798 align:start position:0%
generation of revenue from uh any other
 
04:45:56.390 --> 04:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
sources that we could uh uh use a study
 
04:46:00.050 --> 04:46:00.060 align:start position:0%
for uh what representative Ames um uh is
 
04:46:03.470 --> 04:46:03.480 align:start position:0%
seeking uh facts thank you
 
04:46:06.288 --> 04:46:06.298 align:start position:0%
uh I I have done a bit of a literature
 
04:46:09.288 --> 04:46:09.298 align:start position:0%
review on this uh certainly certainly
 
04:46:12.110 --> 04:46:12.120 align:start position:0%
there there is plenty of uh confirmatory
 
04:46:14.628 --> 04:46:14.638 align:start position:0%
evidence if that's the case of of
 
04:46:16.730 --> 04:46:16.740 align:start position:0%
increased business activity but I think
 
04:46:18.948 --> 04:46:18.958 align:start position:0%
it also depends uh as representative
 
04:46:21.530 --> 04:46:21.540 align:start position:0%
major pointed out in his testimony that
 
04:46:24.948 --> 04:46:24.958 align:start position:0%
uh that that sometimes consumption is
 
04:46:27.050 --> 04:46:27.060 align:start position:0%
fairly stable and
 
04:46:29.090 --> 04:46:29.100 align:start position:0%
um and increases in reduction in some
 
04:46:29.100 --> 04:46:30.230 align:start position:0%
um and increases in reduction in some
taxes

04:46:30.230 --> 04:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
04:46:32.990 --> 04:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
we'll have little or no little no impact
 
04:46:35.510 --> 04:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
on the actual level of consumption uh as
 
04:46:37.070 --> 04:46:37.080 align:start position:0%
much as I hate to say it the we've seen
 
04:46:38.990 --> 04:46:39.000 align:start position:0%
that quite a bit with the meals and
 
04:46:41.628 --> 04:46:41.638 align:start position:0%
Rental tax where increasing the tax rate
 
04:46:43.850 --> 04:46:43.860 align:start position:0%
has not resulted necessarily in a drop
 
04:46:47.330 --> 04:46:47.340 align:start position:0%
in consumption uh whereas there are a
 
04:46:50.570 --> 04:46:50.580 align:start position:0%
lot of other taxes where where the
 
04:46:53.990 --> 04:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
economic impact is more sensitive and I
 
04:46:55.190 --> 04:46:55.200 align:start position:0%
think that that
 
04:46:57.410 --> 04:46:57.420 align:start position:0%
um certainly certainly there's a great
 
04:46:59.330 --> 04:46:59.340 align:start position:0%
deal of body of research and to the
 
04:47:01.010 --> 04:47:01.020 align:start position:0%
extent that I can be helpful to the
 
04:47:03.410 --> 04:47:03.420 align:start position:0%
committee I'd be happy to to look up and
 
04:47:05.810 --> 04:47:05.820 align:start position:0%
try to identify any of that research and
 
04:47:07.730 --> 04:47:07.740 align:start position:0%
provide it to the committee as as you
 
04:47:10.970 --> 04:47:10.980 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:13.550 --> 04:47:13.560 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much
 
04:47:16.430 --> 04:47:16.440 align:start position:0%
uh thank you uh Mr Moore appreciate your
 
04:47:20.330 --> 04:47:20.340 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you okay next up is uh
 
04:47:24.650 --> 04:47:24.660 align:start position:0%
Drew Klein can we uh open him up
 
04:47:26.628 --> 04:47:26.638 align:start position:0%
hi there thank you
 
04:47:28.788 --> 04:47:28.798 align:start position:0%
um if everybody can hear me I think you
 
04:47:30.770 --> 04:47:30.780 align:start position:0%
missed it so can you uh let us know who
 
04:47:33.110 --> 04:47:33.120 align:start position:0%
you're representing these days sure yeah
 
04:47:35.628 --> 04:47:35.638 align:start position:0%
so um I'll turn it up my volume a little
 
04:47:37.730 --> 04:47:37.740 align:start position:0%
bit here I'm Drew Klein I'm president of
 
04:47:39.288 --> 04:47:39.298 align:start position:0%
the Josiah Bartlett Center for Public
 
04:47:41.990 --> 04:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
Policy the free market think tank in New
 
04:47:44.510 --> 04:47:44.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and my interest in this is
 
04:47:47.930 --> 04:47:47.940 align:start position:0%
testimony today is just to actually
 
04:47:49.368 --> 04:47:49.378 align:start position:0%
answer some of the questions that I've
 
04:47:52.070 --> 04:47:52.080 align:start position:0%
heard uh brought up by members of the
 
04:47:52.080 --> 04:47:53.050 align:start position:0%
heard uh brought up by members of the
committee

04:47:53.050 --> 04:47:53.060 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:47:55.490 --> 04:47:55.500 align:start position:0%
regarding the effect of business tax
 
04:47:57.890 --> 04:47:57.900 align:start position:0%
rate reductions on state revenues in the
 
04:48:01.150 --> 04:48:01.160 align:start position:0%
past few years so if you go back to 2015
 
04:48:04.128 --> 04:48:04.138 align:start position:0%
when you had the state budget debate
 
04:48:06.170 --> 04:48:06.180 align:start position:0%
over the tax rate reductions Governor
 
04:48:07.850 --> 04:48:07.860 align:start position:0%
Hassan predicted that the business tax
 
04:48:10.970 --> 04:48:10.980 align:start position:0%
rate tax rate reductions would create a
 
04:48:13.010 --> 04:48:13.020 align:start position:0%
90 million dollar hole in the upcoming
 
04:48:15.230 --> 04:48:15.240 align:start position:0%
two-year budget
 
04:48:17.208 --> 04:48:17.218 align:start position:0%
but what actually happened
 
04:48:20.530 --> 04:48:20.540 align:start position:0%
instead business tax revenues came in
 
04:48:24.050 --> 04:48:24.060 align:start position:0%
132.8 million or 23.4 percent above plan
 
04:48:26.770 --> 04:48:26.780 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 2016.
 
04:48:30.170 --> 04:48:30.180 align:start position:0%
72.7 million or 12.9 percent above plan
 
04:48:34.030 --> 04:48:34.040 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 2017. the next budget
 
04:48:36.610 --> 04:48:36.620 align:start position:0%
business taxes came in
 
04:48:40.670 --> 04:48:40.680 align:start position:0%
118.8 million or 17.9 percent above plan
 
04:48:43.930 --> 04:48:43.940 align:start position:0%
and fiscal year 2018. and
 
04:48:47.810 --> 04:48:47.820 align:start position:0%
151.6 million or 23.2 percent above plan
 
04:48:50.750 --> 04:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
and FY 2019.
 
04:48:52.550 --> 04:48:52.560 align:start position:0%
so you look back at those four years
 
04:48:55.190 --> 04:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
since the business tax rate reductions
 
04:48:57.350 --> 04:48:57.360 align:start position:0%
began in 2016
 
04:48:59.690 --> 04:48:59.700 align:start position:0%
business tax revenues exceeded budget
 
04:49:02.530 --> 04:49:02.540 align:start position:0%
projections by a combined
 
04:49:05.510 --> 04:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
475.6 million dollars
 
04:49:07.610 --> 04:49:07.620 align:start position:0%
so we're talking about almost half a
 
04:49:10.628 --> 04:49:10.638 align:start position:0%
billion dollars in new Revenue
 
04:49:10.638 --> 04:49:12.230 align:start position:0%
billion dollars in new Revenue
unanticipated

04:49:12.230 --> 04:49:12.240 align:start position:0%
unanticipated
 
04:49:15.288 --> 04:49:15.298 align:start position:0%
um above budget projections
 
04:49:17.448 --> 04:49:17.458 align:start position:0%
in 2017
 
04:49:19.430 --> 04:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
the office of legislative budget
 
04:49:21.110 --> 04:49:21.120 align:start position:0%
assistant projected that the additional
 
04:49:23.510 --> 04:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
business tax rate reductions passed in
 
04:49:23.520 --> 04:49:24.830 align:start position:0%
business tax rate reductions passed in
2017

04:49:24.830 --> 04:49:24.840 align:start position:0%
2017
 
04:49:26.810 --> 04:49:26.820 align:start position:0%
would cause an 11 million dollar
 
04:49:29.150 --> 04:49:29.160 align:start position:0%
reduction in business tax revenues in
 
04:49:31.970 --> 04:49:31.980 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2019.
 
04:49:35.110 --> 04:49:35.120 align:start position:0%
instead business tax revenues came in
 
04:49:39.170 --> 04:49:39.180 align:start position:0%
15.16 million above plan that year
 
04:49:41.208 --> 04:49:41.218 align:start position:0%
I am not saying that the business tax
 
04:49:43.550 --> 04:49:43.560 align:start position:0%
revenues it caused all of those
 
04:49:46.368 --> 04:49:46.378 align:start position:0%
increases as representative Bellamy
 
04:49:48.590 --> 04:49:48.600 align:start position:0%
points out there was economic growth
 
04:49:50.750 --> 04:49:50.760 align:start position:0%
elsewhere in the country
 
04:49:52.610 --> 04:49:52.620 align:start position:0%
but I would point out
 
04:49:56.150 --> 04:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
that GDP growth in the United States in
 
04:49:57.708 --> 04:49:57.718 align:start position:0%
those four years and I just did this
 
04:49:59.930 --> 04:49:59.940 align:start position:0%
quick calculation looking at Federal
 
04:50:02.090 --> 04:50:02.100 align:start position:0%
Reserve data
 
04:50:04.610 --> 04:50:04.620 align:start position:0%
economic growth in the U.S GDP growth
 
04:50:08.810 --> 04:50:08.820 align:start position:0%
was 9.3 percent from 2016 to 2019. in
 
04:50:11.030 --> 04:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire GDP growth was 11.6
 
04:50:12.910 --> 04:50:12.920 align:start position:0%
percent so it was more than two percent
 
04:50:16.310 --> 04:50:16.320 align:start position:0%
greater than the U.S average since we've
 
04:50:18.770 --> 04:50:18.780 align:start position:0%
been cutting these business tax rates
 
04:50:18.780 --> 04:50:20.510 align:start position:0%
been cutting these business tax rates
um

04:50:20.510 --> 04:50:20.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:50:24.050 --> 04:50:24.060 align:start position:0%
I think the obvious takeaway is that the
 
04:50:25.850 --> 04:50:25.860 align:start position:0%
way when you have this physical note
 
04:50:28.670 --> 04:50:28.680 align:start position:0%
done by the Legislative budget assistant
 
04:50:28.680 --> 04:50:29.628 align:start position:0%
done by the Legislative budget assistant
um

04:50:29.628 --> 04:50:29.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:50:32.448 --> 04:50:32.458 align:start position:0%
that is as they say static it is not
 
04:50:34.610 --> 04:50:34.620 align:start position:0%
Dynamic and what that means is that they
 
04:50:36.350 --> 04:50:36.360 align:start position:0%
do not take into account when they do
 
04:50:39.948 --> 04:50:39.958 align:start position:0%
this calculation what the effects of the
 
04:50:42.890 --> 04:50:42.900 align:start position:0%
business tax rate changes would be on
 
04:50:46.128 --> 04:50:46.138 align:start position:0%
Behavior I simply look at numbers on a
 
04:50:47.990 --> 04:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet and when you consider what
 
04:50:52.010 --> 04:50:52.020 align:start position:0%
the changes to business Behavior are you
 
04:50:52.020 --> 04:50:52.990 align:start position:0%
the changes to business Behavior are you
see

04:50:52.990 --> 04:50:53.000 align:start position:0%
see
 
04:50:56.390 --> 04:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
that it does in fact stimulate some
 
04:50:58.730 --> 04:50:58.740 align:start position:0%
additional economic activity and we know
 
04:51:01.730 --> 04:51:01.740 align:start position:0%
this not just from art laugher who has
 
04:51:03.050 --> 04:51:03.060 align:start position:0%
been brought up several times here as
 
04:51:05.750 --> 04:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
the Godfather of supply side economics
 
04:51:08.930 --> 04:51:08.940 align:start position:0%
but since then there's been a tremendous
 
04:51:11.150 --> 04:51:11.160 align:start position:0%
amount of research from all sorts of
 
04:51:13.970 --> 04:51:13.980 align:start position:0%
economists on the effects of business
 
04:51:17.090 --> 04:51:17.100 align:start position:0%
tax rate changes and so you will find
 
04:51:19.368 --> 04:51:19.378 align:start position:0%
some outlier Studies by and large they
 
04:51:22.788 --> 04:51:22.798 align:start position:0%
do show that there is a negative effect
 
04:51:24.470 --> 04:51:24.480 align:start position:0%
on economic growth from high business
 
04:51:26.868 --> 04:51:26.878 align:start position:0%
tax rates and a positive effect on
 
04:51:28.430 --> 04:51:28.440 align:start position:0%
economic growth from lower business tax
 
04:51:31.190 --> 04:51:31.200 align:start position:0%
rates in addition in since this bill
 
04:51:33.410 --> 04:51:33.420 align:start position:0%
does focus a little bit more on the bet
 
04:51:35.990 --> 04:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
I think it's worth pointing out that
 
04:51:38.390 --> 04:51:38.400 align:start position:0%
that effect is particularly strong with
 
04:51:41.628 --> 04:51:41.638 align:start position:0%
small businesses I would point to a 2018
 
04:51:44.270 --> 04:51:44.280 align:start position:0%
study by their Federal Reserve
 
04:51:46.368 --> 04:51:46.378 align:start position:0%
so just a couple years ago
 
04:51:47.930 --> 04:51:47.940 align:start position:0%
they did a study looking at
 
04:51:51.288 --> 04:51:51.298 align:start position:0%
entrepreneurship and state Taxation and
 
04:51:53.690 --> 04:51:53.700 align:start position:0%
their conclusion was
 
04:51:55.850 --> 04:51:55.860 align:start position:0%
um and I can I can quote from the study
 
04:51:59.628 --> 04:51:59.638 align:start position:0%
we find a quote we find that new firm
 
04:52:01.430 --> 04:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
employment is negatively and
 
04:52:03.170 --> 04:52:03.180 align:start position:0%
disproportionately affected by corporate
 
04:52:04.970 --> 04:52:04.980 align:start position:0%
tax rates end quote
 
04:52:07.070 --> 04:52:07.080 align:start position:0%
so there is a great body of literature
 
04:52:09.890 --> 04:52:09.900 align:start position:0%
showing that lowering business tax rates
 
04:52:12.650 --> 04:52:12.660 align:start position:0%
corporate tax rates does have a bit of a
 
04:52:14.930 --> 04:52:14.940 align:start position:0%
stimulative effect on the economy can
 
04:52:17.350 --> 04:52:17.360 align:start position:0%
help GDP growth and can particularly
 
04:52:21.288 --> 04:52:21.298 align:start position:0%
help small businesses and since almost
 
04:52:22.970 --> 04:52:22.980 align:start position:0%
all businesses in New Hampshire the
 
04:52:25.788 --> 04:52:25.798 align:start position:0%
large majority are small businesses I
 
04:52:27.288 --> 04:52:27.298 align:start position:0%
think one of the takeaways you can have
 
04:52:29.570 --> 04:52:29.580 align:start position:0%
from lowering these rates particularly
 
04:52:31.610 --> 04:52:31.620 align:start position:0%
the bet is that it would have a positive
 
04:52:36.170 --> 04:52:36.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:39.350 --> 04:52:39.360 align:start position:0%
and that's all I have thank you Mr Klein
 
04:52:41.830 --> 04:52:41.840 align:start position:0%

hanging in here with us I just want to
 
04:54:04.010 --> 04:54:04.020 align:start position:0%
say for the committee this is the bill
 
04:54:06.050 --> 04:54:06.060 align:start position:0%
relatively including under the meals and
 
04:54:08.050 --> 04:54:08.060 align:start position:0%
rooms tax facilitators of Internet
 
04:54:10.610 --> 04:54:10.620 align:start position:0%

04:54:16.910 --> 04:54:16.920 align:start position:0%
transactions of room uh occupancies
 
04:54:18.470 --> 04:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
I just want to point out to the
 
04:54:21.350 --> 04:54:21.360 align:start position:0%
committee those new nine members this is
 
04:54:22.850 --> 04:54:22.860 align:start position:0%
a bill that we've worked on very hard
 
04:54:26.510 --> 04:54:26.520 align:start position:0%
last year uh and that uh for whatever
 
04:54:28.010 --> 04:54:28.020 align:start position:0%
reason didn't make it through the Senate
 
04:54:31.368 --> 04:54:31.378 align:start position:0%
uh but I think and we merged
 
04:54:34.730 --> 04:54:34.740 align:start position:0%
representative uh had a he was a sponsor
 
04:54:38.330 --> 04:54:38.340 align:start position:0%
of the uh last year was the sponsor of
 
04:54:42.770 --> 04:54:42.780 align:start position:0%
the uh uh the not the room of meals but
 
04:54:45.170 --> 04:54:45.180 align:start position:0%
the auto the motor vehicle rentals piece
 
04:54:46.970 --> 04:54:46.980 align:start position:0%
of this we merged the two bills last
 
04:54:49.730 --> 04:54:49.740 align:start position:0%
year into one but with that I'll turn it
 
04:54:54.110 --> 04:54:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:56.930 --> 04:54:56.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman actually this is
 
04:54:58.430 --> 04:54:58.440 align:start position:0%
the third session we've had this because
 
04:55:00.350 --> 04:55:00.360 align:start position:0%
remember in the first session
 
04:55:02.208 --> 04:55:02.218 align:start position:0%
it was the Wayfarer decision we were
 
04:55:04.070 --> 04:55:04.080 align:start position:0%
waiting for right exactly and then we
 
04:55:06.770 --> 04:55:06.780 align:start position:0%
went into the second session and last uh
 
04:55:09.410 --> 04:55:09.420 align:start position:0%
last year because of the pandemic it got
 
04:55:11.990 --> 04:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
thrown in for the mix and it was one of
 
04:55:13.788 --> 04:55:13.798 align:start position:0%
those 30 or 40 bills the Senate put
 
04:55:15.650 --> 04:55:15.660 align:start position:0%
together and um and that one didn't make
 
04:55:17.270 --> 04:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
it that one didn't make it through right
 
04:55:19.570 --> 04:55:19.580 align:start position:0%
so this is the third try
 
04:55:23.810 --> 04:55:23.820 align:start position:0%
uh first of all I want to I uh some
 
04:55:26.090 --> 04:55:26.100 align:start position:0%
people have said that this is a tax a
 
04:55:29.810 --> 04:55:29.820 align:start position:0%
new tax or a tax increase uh I want to
 
04:55:34.190 --> 04:55:34.200 align:start position:0%
make sure everyone understands it is not
 
04:55:37.128 --> 04:55:37.138 align:start position:0%
I think it was about 15 years ago
 
04:55:40.970 --> 04:55:40.980 align:start position:0%
uh the legislature voted to include uh
 
04:55:43.310 --> 04:55:43.320 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle rentals into the rooms and
 
04:55:45.050 --> 04:55:45.060 align:start position:0%
meal Stacks I can't remember exactly how
 
04:55:46.010 --> 04:55:46.020 align:start position:0%
many years
 
04:55:49.850 --> 04:55:49.860 align:start position:0%
since then we've had a new type of um
 
04:55:53.810 --> 04:55:53.820 align:start position:0%
rental company come into existence
 
04:55:58.310 --> 04:55:58.320 align:start position:0%
um they have people it's it's I think
 
04:56:00.350 --> 04:56:00.360 align:start position:0%
it's based some way on the same thing as
 
04:56:02.570 --> 04:56:02.580 align:start position:0%
Uber is where people use their personal
 
04:56:06.350 --> 04:56:06.360 align:start position:0%
cars only this one the people rent their
 
04:56:07.730 --> 04:56:07.740 align:start position:0%
personal cars
 
04:56:11.390 --> 04:56:11.400 align:start position:0%
uh through different companies and one
 
04:56:13.250 --> 04:56:13.260 align:start position:0%
of the bigger ones that we run into was
 
04:56:14.750 --> 04:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
a company called churro out of
 
04:56:14.760 --> 04:56:17.330 align:start position:0%
a company called churro out of
California

04:56:17.330 --> 04:56:17.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:19.250 --> 04:56:19.260 align:start position:0%
the other facilitator
 
04:56:21.288 --> 04:56:21.298 align:start position:0%
of the rental
 
04:56:23.750 --> 04:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
and let's say representative Doucette
 
04:56:26.510 --> 04:56:26.520 align:start position:0%
has an extra cash he wants to rent it
 
04:56:29.510 --> 04:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
well he can rent that car through Toro
 
04:56:31.610 --> 04:56:31.620 align:start position:0%
and then he gets a percentage of the
 
04:56:31.620 --> 04:56:33.350 align:start position:0%
and then he gets a percentage of the
money

04:56:33.350 --> 04:56:33.360 align:start position:0%
money
 
04:56:36.050 --> 04:56:36.060 align:start position:0%
so what we discovered and it was brought
 
04:56:37.788 --> 04:56:37.798 align:start position:0%
to our attention by the rental car
 
04:56:41.390 --> 04:56:41.400 align:start position:0%
companies is that
 
04:56:43.368 --> 04:56:43.378 align:start position:0%
if we're going to charge the rental car
 
04:56:45.650 --> 04:56:45.660 align:start position:0%
companies the nine percent
 
04:56:47.750 --> 04:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
than anybody renting a car should be
 
04:56:50.030 --> 04:56:50.040 align:start position:0%
charged to nine percent
 
04:56:52.910 --> 04:56:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:55.850 --> 04:56:55.860 align:start position:0%
that's why I I am I am insistent that
 
04:56:57.410 --> 04:56:57.420 align:start position:0%
this is not a new tax this is something
 
04:56:58.730 --> 04:56:58.740 align:start position:0%
that's fair
 
04:56:59.930 --> 04:56:59.940 align:start position:0%
if you want to get rid of the nine
 
04:57:02.270 --> 04:57:02.280 align:start position:0%
percent in the rental car companies go
 
04:57:04.310 --> 04:57:04.320 align:start position:0%
for it I'm all for it but if you're
 
04:57:05.690 --> 04:57:05.700 align:start position:0%
going to keep the nine percent on the
 
04:57:08.810 --> 04:57:08.820 align:start position:0%
rental car companies then I think any
 
04:57:11.270 --> 04:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
company renting a car should have to pay
 
04:57:12.708 --> 04:57:12.718 align:start position:0%
the nine percent
 
04:57:15.530 --> 04:57:15.540 align:start position:0%
that's pretty much what this uh what
 
04:57:18.288 --> 04:57:18.298 align:start position:0%
this bill does uh I'll let you address
 
04:57:21.350 --> 04:57:21.360 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman the other part on the Airbnb
 
04:57:23.930 --> 04:57:23.940 align:start position:0%
part because obviously that was a thing
 
04:57:26.628 --> 04:57:26.638 align:start position:0%
that you instituted you know into this
 
04:57:27.948 --> 04:57:27.958 align:start position:0%
bill there were two bills and I
 
04:57:29.330 --> 04:57:29.340 align:start position:0%
understand that
 
04:57:29.340 --> 04:57:30.708 align:start position:0%
understand that
so

04:57:30.708 --> 04:57:30.718 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:57:33.890 --> 04:57:33.900 align:start position:0%
that's all this bill does is it makes it
 
04:57:37.730 --> 04:57:37.740 align:start position:0%
a plain a fair playing field it's that
 
04:57:39.288 --> 04:57:39.298 align:start position:0%
if one company is going to be charged
 
04:57:41.270 --> 04:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
nine percent and this company is over
 
04:57:43.970 --> 04:57:43.980 align:start position:0%
here it's a different model they do it
 
04:57:46.850 --> 04:57:46.860 align:start position:0%
differently but it's still a rental car
 
04:57:46.860 --> 04:57:48.110 align:start position:0%
differently but it's still a rental car
company

04:57:48.110 --> 04:57:48.120 align:start position:0%
company
 
04:57:48.120 --> 04:57:50.930 align:start position:0%
company
so

04:57:50.930 --> 04:57:50.940 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:54.288 --> 04:57:54.298 align:start position:0%
all I'm asking is that um we will
 
04:57:56.628 --> 04:57:56.638 align:start position:0%
forward with this bill and make it fair
 
04:58:03.368 --> 04:58:03.378 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:06.288 --> 04:58:06.298 align:start position:0%
okay we just discovered that I'm also a
 
04:58:08.390 --> 04:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
sponsor on the bill so I I shouldn't be
 
04:58:09.890 --> 04:58:09.900 align:start position:0%
chairing this so we're going to ask Alan
 
04:58:12.650 --> 04:58:12.660 align:start position:0%
Bernstein to to uh this is for the
 
04:58:15.410 --> 04:58:15.420 align:start position:0%
committee well actually Mr chairman you
 
04:58:17.510 --> 04:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
can share as long as you don't get into
 
04:58:19.490 --> 04:58:19.500 align:start position:0%
any discussion or ask any questions okay
 
04:58:22.310 --> 04:58:22.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:58:24.530 --> 04:58:24.540 align:start position:0%
as long as you don't testify and you
 
04:58:25.970 --> 04:58:25.980 align:start position:0%
don't ask questions
 
04:58:29.708 --> 04:58:29.718 align:start position:0%
all right you cannot or I could care
 
04:58:33.230 --> 04:58:33.240 align:start position:0%
is a member uh is a member of the
 
04:58:34.788 --> 04:58:34.798 align:start position:0%
committee whether president here who was
 
04:58:36.890 --> 04:58:36.900 align:start position:0%
here last year or on I want to explain
 
04:58:38.810 --> 04:58:38.820 align:start position:0%
the airbn but we used to call it the
 
04:58:40.128 --> 04:58:40.138 align:start position:0%
Airbnb bill
 
04:58:41.750 --> 04:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh to someone want to just add a little
 
04:58:43.730 --> 04:58:43.740 align:start position:0%
light on that for for the rest of the
 
04:58:46.430 --> 04:58:46.440 align:start position:0%
members representative Al May will
 
04:58:49.610 --> 04:58:49.620 align:start position:0%
okay representative recognize
 
04:58:55.368 --> 04:58:55.378 align:start position:0%
thank you on last year we we had been
 
04:58:57.530 --> 04:58:57.540 align:start position:0%
dealing the dra had been dealing for
 
04:58:59.930 --> 04:58:59.940 align:start position:0%
quite some time with this issue with
 
04:59:04.670 --> 04:59:04.680 align:start position:0%
Hotel lodgings uh the hotel lodging
 
04:59:08.208 --> 04:59:08.218 align:start position:0%
companies that arranged on the internet
 
04:59:08.218 --> 04:59:10.010 align:start position:0%
companies that arranged on the internet
for

04:59:10.010 --> 04:59:10.020 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:59:12.350 --> 04:59:12.360 align:start position:0%
um they would buy up large quantities of
 
04:59:16.128 --> 04:59:16.138 align:start position:0%
hotel rooms in in New Hampshire for
 
04:59:19.490 --> 04:59:19.500 align:start position:0%
instance and then offer them at lower
 
04:59:23.270 --> 04:59:23.280 align:start position:0%
prices than what they would be be
 
04:59:26.750 --> 04:59:26.760 align:start position:0%
offered at by the hotel itself and it
 
04:59:29.208 --> 04:59:29.218 align:start position:0%
did that because it was not paying the
 
04:59:30.530 --> 04:59:30.540 align:start position:0%
nine percent
 
04:59:34.128 --> 04:59:34.138 align:start position:0%
it declared that the nine percent was a
 
04:59:36.288 --> 04:59:36.298 align:start position:0%
commission that had nothing to do with
 
04:59:37.970 --> 04:59:37.980 align:start position:0%
the regular cost
 
04:59:40.970 --> 04:59:40.980 align:start position:0%
and the dra can probably correct me on
 
04:59:44.448 --> 04:59:44.458 align:start position:0%
this if if they want to but on and the
 
04:59:46.788 --> 04:59:46.798 align:start position:0%
DIA finally managed to reach an
 
04:59:49.610 --> 04:59:49.620 align:start position:0%
agreement with Airbnb that they would
 
04:59:52.550 --> 04:59:52.560 align:start position:0%
pay the nine percent but that left all
 
04:59:54.590 --> 04:59:54.600 align:start position:0%
the smaller companies that were doing
 
04:59:57.770 --> 04:59:57.780 align:start position:0%
this and it left Airbnb at a
 
05:00:00.650 --> 05:00:00.660 align:start position:0%
disadvantage with those companies
 
05:00:02.810 --> 05:00:02.820 align:start position:0%
so on
 
05:00:06.110 --> 05:00:06.120 align:start position:0%
that it was brought there was a lawsuit
 
05:00:07.850 --> 05:00:07.860 align:start position:0%
which the dra can tell you more about
 
05:00:10.310 --> 05:00:10.320 align:start position:0%
there was a lawsuit on by some of those
 
05:00:11.690 --> 05:00:11.700 align:start position:0%
companies saying we don't have to pay
 
05:00:14.090 --> 05:00:14.100 align:start position:0%
this and it went to our Supreme Court
 
05:00:17.230 --> 05:00:17.240 align:start position:0%
and our Supreme Court New Hampshire said
 
05:00:20.208 --> 05:00:20.218 align:start position:0%
uh you're right under the law the way it
 
05:00:22.368 --> 05:00:22.378 align:start position:0%
is now you can't you don't have to pay
 
05:00:25.010 --> 05:00:25.020 align:start position:0%
this but if they just change this piece
 
05:00:27.708 --> 05:00:27.718 align:start position:0%
yes yes you should be paying this
 
05:00:31.368 --> 05:00:31.378 align:start position:0%
and so that's why that bill came in it
 
05:00:33.350 --> 05:00:33.360 align:start position:0%
was sponsored by representative Butler
 
05:00:37.490 --> 05:00:37.500 align:start position:0%
who uh did not run again this term who
 
05:00:39.650 --> 05:00:39.660 align:start position:0%
runs a small BNB which was being
 
05:00:43.190 --> 05:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
discriminated against by this also on
 
05:00:43.200 --> 05:00:44.810 align:start position:0%
discriminated against by this also on
and

05:00:44.810 --> 05:00:44.820 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:00:44.820 --> 05:00:46.490 align:start position:0%
and
on

05:00:46.490 --> 05:00:46.500 align:start position:0%
on
 
05:00:49.970 --> 05:00:49.980 align:start position:0%
that bill also it was something that we
 
05:00:52.070 --> 05:00:52.080 align:start position:0%
were going to put through very easily
 
05:00:55.128 --> 05:00:55.138 align:start position:0%
there was no opposition to it on
 
05:00:59.570 --> 05:00:59.580 align:start position:0%
developing it all and uh we got hit by
 
05:01:01.190 --> 05:01:01.200 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
05:01:04.090 --> 05:01:04.100 align:start position:0%
the sentence on the bus
 
05:01:08.868 --> 05:01:08.878 align:start position:0%
requirements and we put those together
 
05:01:11.930 --> 05:01:11.940 align:start position:0%
largely because they're they are doing
 
05:01:14.510 --> 05:01:14.520 align:start position:0%
exactly the same thing from two
 
05:01:17.270 --> 05:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
different segments of Industry on to
 
05:01:19.788 --> 05:01:19.798 align:start position:0%
exactly the same sections of the statute
 
05:01:22.128 --> 05:01:22.138 align:start position:0%
and we wanted to make sure that it was
 
05:01:22.138 --> 05:01:23.628 align:start position:0%
and we wanted to make sure that it was
consistent

05:01:23.628 --> 05:01:23.638 align:start position:0%
consistent
 
05:01:28.070 --> 05:01:28.080 align:start position:0%
so that's why that piece of this is in
 
05:01:30.590 --> 05:01:30.600 align:start position:0%
here and
 
05:01:33.830 --> 05:01:33.840 align:start position:0%
um it seems to it there may be a company
 
05:01:36.470 --> 05:01:36.480 align:start position:0%
or two still trying to avoid being paxed
 
05:01:39.470 --> 05:01:39.480 align:start position:0%
for the same thing Airbnb is paying and
 
05:01:42.910 --> 05:01:42.920 align:start position:0%
and all of our brick and mortar hotels
 
05:01:48.050 --> 05:01:48.060 align:start position:0%
and bnbs are paying uh but
 
05:01:49.730 --> 05:01:49.740 align:start position:0%
um we heard very little if any
 
05:01:49.740 --> 05:01:55.090 align:start position:0%
um we heard very little if any
opposition

05:01:55.090 --> 05:01:55.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:59.390 --> 05:01:59.400 align:start position:0%
if I may add to them that um
 
05:02:02.510 --> 05:02:02.520 align:start position:0%
the one of the other discrepancies here
 
05:02:04.490 --> 05:02:04.500 align:start position:0%
in which we didn't take into effect
 
05:02:07.250 --> 05:02:07.260 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't affect the state is
 
05:02:08.990 --> 05:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
the airport
 
05:02:12.830 --> 05:02:12.840 align:start position:0%
also charges uh the rental car companies
 
05:02:15.530 --> 05:02:15.540 align:start position:0%
a 10 fee
 
05:02:18.530 --> 05:02:18.540 align:start position:0%
on in the state charges the nine percent
 
05:02:20.810 --> 05:02:20.820 align:start position:0%
so uh you know some of the rental car
 
05:02:24.110 --> 05:02:24.120 align:start position:0%
companies hurts Davis Enterprise were
 
05:02:25.850 --> 05:02:25.860 align:start position:0%
paying when they rented a car at the
 
05:02:27.550 --> 05:02:27.560 align:start position:0%
airport the next 20
 
05:02:31.190 --> 05:02:31.200 align:start position:0%
and these uh companies that were doing
 
05:02:34.430 --> 05:02:34.440 align:start position:0%
renting the past privately would still
 
05:02:37.190 --> 05:02:37.200 align:start position:0%
deliver the cost to the airport
 
05:02:39.948 --> 05:02:39.958 align:start position:0%
yeah parking in the parking lot have
 
05:02:39.958 --> 05:02:40.910 align:start position:0%
yeah parking in the parking lot have
somebody

05:02:40.910 --> 05:02:40.920 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
05:02:43.010 --> 05:02:43.020 align:start position:0%
pick the car up they would have a cold
 
05:02:44.810 --> 05:02:44.820 align:start position:0%
they would pick the car up bring it back
 
05:02:46.010 --> 05:02:46.020 align:start position:0%
to the airport
 
05:02:47.930 --> 05:02:47.940 align:start position:0%
and not paying the airport 10 percent
 
05:02:47.940 --> 05:02:49.310 align:start position:0%
and not paying the airport 10 percent
fee

05:02:49.310 --> 05:02:49.320 align:start position:0%
fee
 
05:02:51.350 --> 05:02:51.360 align:start position:0%
now that's a different and quite a few
 
05:02:53.628 --> 05:02:53.638 align:start position:0%
of the airports in the country got a
 
05:02:56.690 --> 05:02:56.700 align:start position:0%
hold of this and have made changes we
 
05:02:58.670 --> 05:02:58.680 align:start position:0%
haven't touched the airport but this is
 
05:03:01.430 --> 05:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
strictly the state fire but uh you can
 
05:03:04.610 --> 05:03:04.620 align:start position:0%
see how unfair it is I mean if we want a
 
05:03:06.530 --> 05:03:06.540 align:start position:0%
fair playing field for our businesses
 
05:03:09.590 --> 05:03:09.600 align:start position:0%
and these brick and motor businesses uh
 
05:03:13.610 --> 05:03:13.620 align:start position:0%
contribute a lot I think the manager of
 
05:03:16.490 --> 05:03:16.500 align:start position:0%
the uh Enterprise is going to also be on
 
05:03:19.070 --> 05:03:19.080 align:start position:0%
the uh and tell you how many people they
 
05:03:20.810 --> 05:03:20.820 align:start position:0%
employ and how many how many dollars
 
05:03:22.368 --> 05:03:22.378 align:start position:0%
they contribute to the economy of the
 
05:03:24.170 --> 05:03:24.180 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire so all we're
 
05:03:25.970 --> 05:03:25.980 align:start position:0%
asking is to share planes here that's
 
05:03:27.770 --> 05:03:27.780 align:start position:0%
all this bill does
 
05:03:29.810 --> 05:03:29.820 align:start position:0%
um again if you want me to get rid of
 
05:03:31.730 --> 05:03:31.740 align:start position:0%
the nine percent it wouldn't bother me a
 
05:03:33.890 --> 05:03:33.900 align:start position:0%
bit but assuming that we're going to
 
05:03:36.830 --> 05:03:36.840 align:start position:0%
keep the nine percent uh I asked that um
 
05:03:39.170 --> 05:03:39.180 align:start position:0%
you uh consider this bill I know it
 
05:03:41.628 --> 05:03:41.638 align:start position:0%
passed out a committee last section on a
 
05:03:44.510 --> 05:03:44.520 align:start position:0%
unanimous vote and uh hopefully we'll
 
05:03:46.788 --> 05:03:46.798 align:start position:0%
get the same unanimous vote and we can
 
05:03:48.708 --> 05:03:48.718 align:start position:0%
give a little bit of fairness to uh
 
05:03:50.628 --> 05:03:50.638 align:start position:0%
those people that are working and
 
05:03:53.570 --> 05:03:53.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:55.190 --> 05:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
um any any other questions for the
 
05:03:58.610 --> 05:03:58.620 align:start position:0%
speaker uh representative Schaumburg
 
05:04:00.470 --> 05:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
05:04:02.390 --> 05:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
 
05:04:02.400 --> 05:04:03.770 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
presentation

05:04:03.770 --> 05:04:03.780 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
05:04:07.010 --> 05:04:07.020 align:start position:0%
uh I guess my question comes down
 
05:04:09.670 --> 05:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
to this do our New Hampshire
 
05:04:12.410 --> 05:04:12.420 align:start position:0%
entrepreneurial individuals who remain
 
05:04:15.590 --> 05:04:15.600 align:start position:0%
as individuals seeking to improve their
 
05:04:18.110 --> 05:04:18.120 align:start position:0%
financial status have to worry about
 
05:04:21.350 --> 05:04:21.360 align:start position:0%
being classified as a company from now
 
05:04:23.868 --> 05:04:23.878 align:start position:0%
on the use of the internet to spread
 
05:04:27.128 --> 05:04:27.138 align:start position:0%
that their own entrepreneurial Spirit
 
05:04:31.490 --> 05:04:31.500 align:start position:0%
uh no no representative uh and that was
 
05:04:33.470 --> 05:04:33.480 align:start position:0%
all taken that that's why this bill sat
 
05:04:35.750 --> 05:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
in this committee last year for two two
 
05:04:37.730 --> 05:04:37.740 align:start position:0%
years almost before it was passed out of
 
05:04:40.448 --> 05:04:40.458 align:start position:0%
committee so dra can work on all of the
 
05:04:43.730 --> 05:04:43.740 align:start position:0%
particulars of it and if I'm correct if
 
05:04:46.490 --> 05:04:46.500 align:start position:0%
I remember correctly uh They said that
 
05:04:48.948 --> 05:04:48.958 align:start position:0%
the individual would not be and you
 
05:04:50.270 --> 05:04:50.280 align:start position:0%
could direct me as a chairman if I'm
 
05:04:51.530 --> 05:04:51.540 align:start position:0%
wrong I know you worked on this
 
05:04:53.930 --> 05:04:53.940 align:start position:0%
extensively the individual would not be
 
05:04:55.788 --> 05:04:55.798 align:start position:0%
the one that would be paying it it would
 
05:04:57.590 --> 05:04:57.600 align:start position:0%
be the company itself that actually
 
05:05:00.050 --> 05:05:00.060 align:start position:0%
collects the money correct and it's in
 
05:05:03.350 --> 05:05:03.360 align:start position:0%
the same the same way that Airbnb done
 
05:05:05.510 --> 05:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
correct the company collects the money
 
05:05:07.610 --> 05:05:07.620 align:start position:0%
and then you know turns into percentage
 
05:05:09.830 --> 05:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
over to you know the person that owns
 
05:05:12.050 --> 05:05:12.060 align:start position:0%
the small house or whatever
 
05:05:14.090 --> 05:05:14.100 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:05:16.970 --> 05:05:16.980 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions can I just add
 
05:05:20.208 --> 05:05:20.218 align:start position:0%
something to that yes thank you I'm
 
05:05:24.530 --> 05:05:24.540 align:start position:0%
sorry to be out of line on the
 
05:05:29.030 --> 05:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
the individual under our current law the
 
05:05:31.610 --> 05:05:31.620 align:start position:0%
individuals are responsible for renting
 
05:05:33.708 --> 05:05:33.718 align:start position:0%
that car the individuals are responsible
 
05:05:37.550 --> 05:05:37.560 align:start position:0%
for renting that home whole uh
 
05:05:42.470 --> 05:05:42.480 align:start position:0%
uh hotel room if they do not pay and the
 
05:05:44.930 --> 05:05:44.940 align:start position:0%
and the hotel
 
05:05:50.350 --> 05:05:50.360 align:start position:0%
or the online company does not pay then
 
05:05:54.708 --> 05:05:54.718 align:start position:0%
the dra can and has sometimes I believe
 
05:05:57.288 --> 05:05:57.298 align:start position:0%
they can talk to you about it go after
 
05:06:00.230 --> 05:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
the individual who had no idea he had a
 
05:06:02.030 --> 05:06:02.040 align:start position:0%
tax to be levied
 
05:06:10.270 --> 05:06:10.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:13.250 --> 05:06:13.260 align:start position:0%
is right but um
 
05:06:15.530 --> 05:06:15.540 align:start position:0%
the uh the thing I'm the thing I'm
 
05:06:17.810 --> 05:06:17.820 align:start position:0%
saying is that these people that are
 
05:06:19.850 --> 05:06:19.860 align:start position:0%
renting their private vehicles
 
05:06:22.970 --> 05:06:22.980 align:start position:0%
uh really don't have a platform unless
 
05:06:24.410 --> 05:06:24.420 align:start position:0%
you know when something some of the
 
05:06:26.090 --> 05:06:26.100 align:start position:0%
things were all brought up as well my
 
05:06:28.250 --> 05:06:28.260 align:start position:0%
neighbor takes my vehicle to go pick up
 
05:06:29.810 --> 05:06:29.820 align:start position:0%
a refrigerator or something are they
 
05:06:30.948 --> 05:06:30.958 align:start position:0%
going to have to pay the nine percent
 
05:06:33.110 --> 05:06:33.120 align:start position:0%
well that's just crazy that's just
 
05:06:35.810 --> 05:06:35.820 align:start position:0%
Ludacris this is the people that sign up
 
05:06:37.910 --> 05:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
with these companies like Toro and a few
 
05:06:40.010 --> 05:06:40.020 align:start position:0%
others out there so they're already in
 
05:06:42.288 --> 05:06:42.298 align:start position:0%
the system and their cars get rented
 
05:06:43.850 --> 05:06:43.860 align:start position:0%
through Turlock
 
05:06:47.150 --> 05:06:47.160 align:start position:0%
or the other companies so it's not like
 
05:06:49.550 --> 05:06:49.560 align:start position:0%
you're going to have anybody out there
 
05:06:52.190 --> 05:06:52.200 align:start position:0%
if somebody out there can successfully
 
05:06:54.788 --> 05:06:54.798 align:start position:0%
individually just rent their vehicle
 
05:06:57.110 --> 05:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
somehow then
 
05:07:00.530 --> 05:07:00.540 align:start position:0%
I'm I I realistically don't think uh you
 
05:07:02.590 --> 05:07:02.600 align:start position:0%
know yeah
 
05:07:05.510 --> 05:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
a couple of times a year but this is the
 
05:07:08.030 --> 05:07:08.040 align:start position:0%
company itself the amount of money right
 
05:07:10.970 --> 05:07:10.980 align:start position:0%
now is small but remember Ubers first
 
05:07:13.368 --> 05:07:13.378 align:start position:0%
started the amount of people using Uber
 
05:07:15.288 --> 05:07:15.298 align:start position:0%
was small and then it got bigger and
 
05:07:17.510 --> 05:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
bigger so if we're going to have a fair
 
05:07:19.910 --> 05:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
playing field then this is I think the
 
05:07:21.948 --> 05:07:21.958 align:start position:0%
way we go otherwise make a change in
 
05:07:26.270 --> 05:07:26.280 align:start position:0%
your taxes uh can I just interject me if
 
05:07:28.430 --> 05:07:28.440 align:start position:0%
you refer to the second page of the bill
 
05:07:32.030 --> 05:07:32.040 align:start position:0%
lines 13 through 18.
 
05:07:34.310 --> 05:07:34.320 align:start position:0%
I think this is addressed
 
05:07:37.490 --> 05:07:37.500 align:start position:0%
that we can't go after
 
05:07:40.128 --> 05:07:40.138 align:start position:0%
the person that owns the room or the
 
05:07:40.138 --> 05:07:42.708 align:start position:0%
the person that owns the room or the
vehicle

05:07:42.708 --> 05:07:42.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:44.510 --> 05:07:44.520 align:start position:0%
I think I think we covered that last
 
05:07:45.948 --> 05:07:45.958 align:start position:0%
year so
 
05:07:48.470 --> 05:07:48.480 align:start position:0%
it's in the bill yeah it was brought up
 
05:07:51.288 --> 05:07:51.298 align:start position:0%
last year yeah yeah I think you're
 
05:07:51.298 --> 05:07:53.390 align:start position:0%
last year yeah yeah I think you're
protected

05:07:53.390 --> 05:07:53.400 align:start position:0%
protected
 
05:07:56.208 --> 05:07:56.218 align:start position:0%
okay very good and it's it's in the bill
 
05:07:58.670 --> 05:07:58.680 align:start position:0%
but it's in the bill with the basis that
 
05:08:00.708 --> 05:08:00.718 align:start position:0%
that somebody else is going to pay it
 
05:08:03.590 --> 05:08:03.600 align:start position:0%
namely the the online company that has
 
05:08:05.270 --> 05:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
been providing the insurance that has
 
05:08:08.690 --> 05:08:08.700 align:start position:0%
been providing uh cleaning and all sorts
 
05:08:11.150 --> 05:08:11.160 align:start position:0%
of things like that
 
05:08:14.270 --> 05:08:14.280 align:start position:0%
okay so we'll have a discussions when we
 
05:08:16.490 --> 05:08:16.500 align:start position:0%
when we meet in uh and we'll be meeting
 
05:08:18.830 --> 05:08:18.840 align:start position:0%
on this bill as a committee thank you
 
05:08:22.010 --> 05:08:22.020 align:start position:0%
very much Mr Speaker okay thank you
 
05:08:24.230 --> 05:08:24.240 align:start position:0%
Dennis says I'm sorry sorry we have one
 
05:08:29.030 --> 05:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:32.330 --> 05:08:32.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair for uh recognizing me
 
05:08:35.030 --> 05:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
and and uh thank you uh Mr Speaker for
 
05:08:38.270 --> 05:08:38.280 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh and this is really
 
05:08:39.530 --> 05:08:39.540 align:start position:0%
for the benefit of the whole committee
 
05:08:42.770 --> 05:08:42.780 align:start position:0%
I'm hopeful that would you agree that uh
 
05:08:46.128 --> 05:08:46.138 align:start position:0%
the work that we did on this bill uh
 
05:08:48.770 --> 05:08:48.780 align:start position:0%
last session was thorough and complete
 
05:08:51.310 --> 05:08:51.320 align:start position:0%
and it's really
 
05:08:53.868 --> 05:08:53.878 align:start position:0%
we put a lot of effort into this to make
 
05:08:56.390 --> 05:08:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:59.810 --> 05:08:59.820 align:start position:0%
uh I would agree 100 representative and
 
05:09:02.208 --> 05:09:02.218 align:start position:0%
that's why it took his you know the two
 
05:09:04.070 --> 05:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
years to do it and I believe you came
 
05:09:05.990 --> 05:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
out with a damn good product so
 
05:09:08.270 --> 05:09:08.280 align:start position:0%
hopefully we can move it forward
 
05:09:10.610 --> 05:09:10.620 align:start position:0%
thank you okay thank you both thank you
 
05:09:11.930 --> 05:09:11.940 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker
 
05:09:15.350 --> 05:09:15.360 align:start position:0%
okay so we have uh seven seven others
 
05:09:17.330 --> 05:09:17.340 align:start position:0%
that want to testify so
 
05:09:19.250 --> 05:09:19.260 align:start position:0%
if we can all be because we're way
 
05:09:20.750 --> 05:09:20.760 align:start position:0%
behind now
 
05:09:20.760 --> 05:09:21.530 align:start position:0%
behind now
um

05:09:21.530 --> 05:09:21.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:09:23.208 --> 05:09:23.218 align:start position:0%
if we could try to keep it to three
 
05:09:25.970 --> 05:09:25.980 align:start position:0%
minutes each that'd be great uh I really
 
05:09:28.490 --> 05:09:28.500 align:start position:0%
appreciate it uh I won't cut you off uh
 
05:09:31.128 --> 05:09:31.138 align:start position:0%
if you go a few minutes all over but we
 
05:09:32.570 --> 05:09:32.580 align:start position:0%
got to kind of keep it down to Adult
 
05:09:34.490 --> 05:09:34.500 align:start position:0%
World here so we can we can get through
 
05:09:34.500 --> 05:09:35.208 align:start position:0%
World here so we can we can get through
this

05:09:35.208 --> 05:09:35.218 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:09:38.330 --> 05:09:38.340 align:start position:0%
so uh we'll start with uh
 
05:09:38.340 --> 05:09:39.830 align:start position:0%
so uh we'll start with uh
Carissa

05:09:39.830 --> 05:09:39.840 align:start position:0%
Carissa
 
05:09:39.840 --> 05:09:41.390 align:start position:0%
Carissa
Alexis

05:09:41.390 --> 05:09:41.400 align:start position:0%
Alexis
 
05:09:43.730 --> 05:09:43.740 align:start position:0%
uh which represents Enterprise Holdings
 
05:09:49.330 --> 05:09:49.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:53.030 --> 05:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
I thought I put her in there we go I
 
05:09:56.410 --> 05:09:56.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:58.850 --> 05:09:58.860 align:start position:0%
Alexis can you also touch why since
 
05:10:00.350 --> 05:10:00.360 align:start position:0%

Enterprise car rental uh can you touch
 
05:10:06.890 --> 05:10:06.900 align:start position:0%

05:10:15.530 --> 05:10:15.540 align:start position:0%

05:10:25.850 --> 05:10:25.860 align:start position:0%
unanimous vote to pass the legislation
 
05:10:27.410 --> 05:10:27.420 align:start position:0%
last session
 
05:10:29.510 --> 05:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
um for those of you that I don't know my
 
05:10:31.730 --> 05:10:31.740 align:start position:0%
name is Chris Alexis I'm a New Hampshire
 
05:10:35.570 --> 05:10:35.580 align:start position:0%
resident I live in Windham my office is
 
05:10:38.090 --> 05:10:38.100 align:start position:0%
based out of Londonderry and I'm also an
 
05:10:40.610 --> 05:10:40.620 align:start position:0%
employer of nearly 400 residents with
 
05:10:43.850 --> 05:10:43.860 align:start position:0%
over 30 locations across the state as
 
05:10:45.830 --> 05:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
the regional vice president overseeing
 
05:10:47.930 --> 05:10:47.940 align:start position:0%
Enterprise Holdings operations in New
 
05:10:50.270 --> 05:10:50.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and as of the last time we
 
05:10:52.730 --> 05:10:52.740 align:start position:0%
were discussing this bill we were proud
 
05:10:54.590 --> 05:10:54.600 align:start position:0%
to have contributed over eight million
 
05:10:57.410 --> 05:10:57.420 align:start position:0%
dollars in state tax revenues we spent
 
05:10:59.390 --> 05:10:59.400 align:start position:0%
over 7 million with local New Hampshire
 
05:11:01.788 --> 05:11:01.798 align:start position:0%
businesses in the Auto industry and
 
05:11:03.590 --> 05:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
donated more than forty six thousand
 
05:11:05.868 --> 05:11:05.878 align:start position:0%
dollars to charitable organizations in
 
05:11:08.570 --> 05:11:08.580 align:start position:0%
our great state so needless to say but I
 
05:11:10.430 --> 05:11:10.440 align:start position:0%
will we're heavily invested in New
 
05:11:12.650 --> 05:11:12.660 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh to the continued prosperity
 
05:11:14.570 --> 05:11:14.580 align:start position:0%
of the families we employ into our
 
05:11:14.580 --> 05:11:15.530 align:start position:0%
of the families we employ into our
communities

05:11:15.530 --> 05:11:15.540 align:start position:0%
communities
 
05:11:17.810 --> 05:11:17.820 align:start position:0%
so my involvement began
 
05:11:19.310 --> 05:11:19.320 align:start position:0%
um in this bill began because Enterprise
 
05:11:21.590 --> 05:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
supports a very simple principle which
 
05:11:23.270 --> 05:11:23.280 align:start position:0%
is equal rules of the road for all
 
05:11:25.190 --> 05:11:25.200 align:start position:0%
rental car transactions and I think
 
05:11:26.990 --> 05:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
speaker Packard represented that
 
05:11:29.330 --> 05:11:29.340 align:start position:0%
perfectly we are not looking to create
 
05:11:30.948 --> 05:11:30.958 align:start position:0%
new taxes
 
05:11:33.230 --> 05:11:33.240 align:start position:0%
um what we do know is the way rental car
 
05:11:35.390 --> 05:11:35.400 align:start position:0%
transactions are conducted has changed
 
05:11:37.550 --> 05:11:37.560 align:start position:0%
and evolved since the original tax rules
 
05:11:39.410 --> 05:11:39.420 align:start position:0%
were written and we're looking to expand
 
05:11:41.510 --> 05:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
the platforms that are covered to create
 
05:11:43.010 --> 05:11:43.020 align:start position:0%
a Level Playing Field for everyone
 
05:11:44.990 --> 05:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
running a car
 
05:11:46.670 --> 05:11:46.680 align:start position:0%
um Enterprise we've been exploring an
 
05:11:48.350 --> 05:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity to offer peer-to-peer car
 
05:11:50.990 --> 05:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
rentals as well and we want to play by
 
05:11:52.788 --> 05:11:52.798 align:start position:0%
the rules when we do so making sure
 
05:11:55.310 --> 05:11:55.320 align:start position:0%
we're paying taxes following consumer
 
05:11:58.010 --> 05:11:58.020 align:start position:0%
protection safety and privacy laws that
 
05:11:59.690 --> 05:11:59.700 align:start position:0%
go along with making Vehicles available
 
05:12:02.090 --> 05:12:02.100 align:start position:0%
for rent to our public because some
 
05:12:03.948 --> 05:12:03.958 align:start position:0%
peer-to-peer companies claim that these
 
05:12:05.868 --> 05:12:05.878 align:start position:0%
laws don't apply to them everyone needs
 
05:12:08.090 --> 05:12:08.100 align:start position:0%
clarities on the rule of the road
 
05:12:10.550 --> 05:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
when we rolled up our sleeves and really
 
05:12:12.350 --> 05:12:12.360 align:start position:0%
started digging into this legislation
 
05:12:16.070 --> 05:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
back in 2019 the opponents argued the
 
05:12:18.530 --> 05:12:18.540 align:start position:0%
language definitions and premise of the
 
05:12:20.150 --> 05:12:20.160 align:start position:0%
bill they tried to create fear about
 
05:12:21.350 --> 05:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
what would happen if the online
 
05:12:23.868 --> 05:12:23.878 align:start position:0%
platforms were to be taxed the way they
 
05:12:26.208 --> 05:12:26.218 align:start position:0%
should be they kept offering to work
 
05:12:27.830 --> 05:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
together to come up with agreeable
 
05:12:29.868 --> 05:12:29.878 align:start position:0%
language that would address all of their
 
05:12:31.850 --> 05:12:31.860 align:start position:0%
concerns but after two years of working
 
05:12:34.490 --> 05:12:34.500 align:start position:0%
on this and the opposite opposition
 
05:12:36.708 --> 05:12:36.718 align:start position:0%
being given a working platform an open
 
05:12:38.810 --> 05:12:38.820 align:start position:0%
discussion to make recommendations they
 
05:12:41.090 --> 05:12:41.100 align:start position:0%
just didn't they kept waning about how
 
05:12:42.590 --> 05:12:42.600 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't work but didn't really give
 
05:12:44.810 --> 05:12:44.820 align:start position:0%
us anything to work with
 
05:12:46.550 --> 05:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
um also in those two years many other
 
05:12:48.230 --> 05:12:48.240 align:start position:0%
states have passed similar legislation
 
05:12:50.208 --> 05:12:50.218 align:start position:0%
and has not stifled the growth of the
 
05:12:52.190 --> 05:12:52.200 align:start position:0%
platforms or any new online rental car
 
05:12:52.200 --> 05:12:54.650 align:start position:0%
platforms or any new online rental car
initiatives

05:12:54.650 --> 05:12:54.660 align:start position:0%
initiatives
 
05:12:56.810 --> 05:12:56.820 align:start position:0%
um I agree with representative Malloy
 
05:12:59.150 --> 05:12:59.160 align:start position:0%
our representative worked really hard to
 
05:13:01.128 --> 05:13:01.138 align:start position:0%
create a bill that was fair and works
 
05:13:03.470 --> 05:13:03.480 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire representative Ami
 
05:13:05.150 --> 05:13:05.160 align:start position:0%
did a great job leading the discussions
 
05:13:07.070 --> 05:13:07.080 align:start position:0%
that got us the bill to a place everyone
 
05:13:10.128 --> 05:13:10.138 align:start position:0%
agreed on and when we passed this
 
05:13:11.930 --> 05:13:11.940 align:start position:0%
through the committee last year the dra
 
05:13:14.090 --> 05:13:14.100 align:start position:0%
agreed this bill was easily applied and
 
05:13:14.100 --> 05:13:16.550 align:start position:0%
agreed this bill was easily applied and
enforceable

05:13:16.550 --> 05:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
enforceable
 
05:13:18.650 --> 05:13:18.660 align:start position:0%
um so at the end of the day to me uh
 
05:13:20.750 --> 05:13:20.760 align:start position:0%
this bill is about fairness and we
 
05:13:22.190 --> 05:13:22.200 align:start position:0%
should not let some peer-to-peer
 
05:13:24.530 --> 05:13:24.540 align:start position:0%
companies Dodge taxes just as many
 
05:13:26.510 --> 05:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
states have already decided and other
 
05:13:28.730 --> 05:13:28.740 align:start position:0%
gig economy debates we're simply asking
 
05:13:30.708 --> 05:13:30.718 align:start position:0%
for equal rules of the road for everyone
 
05:13:33.770 --> 05:13:33.780 align:start position:0%
in the car rental space competition is
 
05:13:36.170 --> 05:13:36.180 align:start position:0%
good and healthy and welcome we just
 
05:13:37.970 --> 05:13:37.980 align:start position:0%
want a fair shot at winning every rental
 
05:13:40.070 --> 05:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
we can and we believe in an even playing
 
05:13:42.830 --> 05:13:42.840 align:start position:0%
field for all rental car providers is
 
05:13:44.868 --> 05:13:44.878 align:start position:0%
necessary to keep a healthy market and
 
05:13:47.628 --> 05:13:47.638 align:start position:0%
Industry I believe there was a request
 
05:13:49.310 --> 05:13:49.320 align:start position:0%
for me to comment on the airport market
 
05:13:52.430 --> 05:13:52.440 align:start position:0%
and here in New Hampshire we work very
 
05:13:58.490 --> 05:13:58.500 align:start position:0%
closely with both MHT and PSM and I know
 
05:14:01.910 --> 05:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
um Ted and the team over at MHT this is
 
05:14:04.190 --> 05:14:04.200 align:start position:0%
very topical for them and you know he's
 
05:14:05.990 --> 05:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
had other legislation that he's brought
 
05:14:07.430 --> 05:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
to the table
 
05:14:09.350 --> 05:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
um but we have had the support of our
 
05:14:11.330 --> 05:14:11.340 align:start position:0%
airport directors here as well to create
 
05:14:13.070 --> 05:14:13.080 align:start position:0%
an even playing field when it comes to
 
05:14:15.350 --> 05:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
rental uh car transactions and
 
05:14:16.850 --> 05:14:16.860 align:start position:0%
facilitators years
 
05:14:18.170 --> 05:14:18.180 align:start position:0%
I don't know if that answered the
 
05:14:21.948 --> 05:14:21.958 align:start position:0%
question but I'm absolutely open to and
 
05:14:23.448 --> 05:14:23.458 align:start position:0%
welcome to any other questions the
 
05:14:26.390 --> 05:14:26.400 align:start position:0%
committee may have okay thank you other
 
05:14:28.430 --> 05:14:28.440 align:start position:0%
questions are there any uh hands up
 
05:14:28.440 --> 05:14:29.470 align:start position:0%
questions are there any uh hands up
please

05:14:29.470 --> 05:14:29.480 align:start position:0%
please
 
05:14:31.788 --> 05:14:31.798 align:start position:0%
representative Alma representative Army
 
05:14:38.150 --> 05:14:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:41.750 --> 05:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman on could you give
 
05:14:44.510 --> 05:14:44.520 align:start position:0%
us a list of the other states that have
 
05:14:46.490 --> 05:14:46.500 align:start position:0%
passed similar legislation now because
 
05:14:49.430 --> 05:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
last time we did this I think
 
05:14:51.830 --> 05:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
we were the only hold out and there were
 
05:14:54.830 --> 05:14:54.840 align:start position:0%
some other states considering things
 
05:14:59.330 --> 05:14:59.340 align:start position:0%
uh correct so we I do have a list and um
 
05:15:02.030 --> 05:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
maybe I will email that over to you guys
 
05:15:03.770 --> 05:15:03.780 align:start position:0%
um because I need to pull it up but I do
 
05:15:06.650 --> 05:15:06.660 align:start position:0%
know when we were talking last session
 
05:15:09.350 --> 05:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
um there was legislation that was passed
 
05:15:11.750 --> 05:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
in the state of Maine they split the tax
 
05:15:14.208 --> 05:15:14.218 align:start position:0%
and the insurance apart I know the
 
05:15:16.250 --> 05:15:16.260 align:start position:0%
insurance doesn't apply here but the tax
 
05:15:18.650 --> 05:15:18.660 align:start position:0%
bill that they put through was very much
 
05:15:19.850 --> 05:15:19.860 align:start position:0%
in line
 
05:15:21.470 --> 05:15:21.480 align:start position:0%
um with what we were looking to do in
 
05:15:22.910 --> 05:15:22.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I think our New Hampshire
 
05:15:25.610 --> 05:15:25.620 align:start position:0%
Bill though works good with what a
 
05:15:27.410 --> 05:15:27.420 align:start position:0%
legislation and tax rules we already
 
05:15:29.448 --> 05:15:29.458 align:start position:0%
have in place in the state
 
05:15:31.670 --> 05:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
um so I can send you a list um that I
 
05:15:32.930 --> 05:15:32.940 align:start position:0%
have I'll email that over to the
 
05:15:32.940 --> 05:15:35.390 align:start position:0%
have I'll email that over to the
committee

05:15:35.390 --> 05:15:35.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:38.270 --> 05:15:38.280 align:start position:0%

we open him up
 
05:16:06.530 --> 05:16:06.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:08.570 --> 05:16:08.580 align:start position:0%
good afternoon members of the committee

are you all able to hear me yes we can
 
05:16:13.670 --> 05:16:13.680 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you for the
 
05:16:15.770 --> 05:16:15.780 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak with you today
 
05:16:17.390 --> 05:16:17.400 align:start position:0%
my name is Steve Sher I'm the president
 
05:16:19.430 --> 05:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
of the travel technology Association I
 
05:16:21.350 --> 05:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
represent companies like Expedia and
 
05:16:23.150 --> 05:16:23.160 align:start position:0%
Priceline and verbo
 
05:16:26.510 --> 05:16:26.520 align:start position:0%
all of whom Inspire and facilitate
 
05:16:28.670 --> 05:16:28.680 align:start position:0%
travel bookings in the state of New
 
05:16:31.730 --> 05:16:31.740 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but before I get into the
 
05:16:33.470 --> 05:16:33.480 align:start position:0%
testimony that I prepared today I wanted
 
05:16:34.550 --> 05:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
to just
 
05:16:37.368 --> 05:16:37.378 align:start position:0%
take a moment and reflect on the
 
05:16:38.810 --> 05:16:38.820 align:start position:0%
speaker's introduction to the
 
05:16:40.910 --> 05:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
legislation and if this bill is really
 
05:16:43.910 --> 05:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
about car sharing then I believe that
 
05:16:46.550 --> 05:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
there's a way to draft the legislation
 
05:16:49.610 --> 05:16:49.620 align:start position:0%
that that narrowly addresses the car
 
05:16:51.650 --> 05:16:51.660 align:start position:0%
sharing issue that's not my issue uh
 
05:16:53.570 --> 05:16:53.580 align:start position:0%
here today my concern with the
 
05:16:56.208 --> 05:16:56.218 align:start position:0%
legislation is that it
 
05:16:59.690 --> 05:16:59.700 align:start position:0%
uh it applies the meals and rooms tax to
 
05:17:01.850 --> 05:17:01.860 align:start position:0%
travel agent fees and I can explain that
 
05:17:04.250 --> 05:17:04.260 align:start position:0%
and that would apply to not only car
 
05:17:06.830 --> 05:17:06.840 align:start position:0%
rentals for people who book uh car
 
05:17:08.750 --> 05:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
rentals through platforms like Expedia
 
05:17:11.030 --> 05:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
and Priceline but also hotels and
 
05:17:12.590 --> 05:17:12.600 align:start position:0%
short-term rentals
 
05:17:14.150 --> 05:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
think of it this way online travel
 
05:17:16.430 --> 05:17:16.440 align:start position:0%
agents like those companies operate much
 
05:17:19.128 --> 05:17:19.138 align:start position:0%
like brick and mortar travel agents they
 
05:17:21.470 --> 05:17:21.480 align:start position:0%
facilitate the booking they don't have
 
05:17:23.330 --> 05:17:23.340 align:start position:0%
possession of the vehicles or the rooms
 
05:17:26.208 --> 05:17:26.218 align:start position:0%
uh simply providing a service and what
 
05:17:28.610 --> 05:17:28.620 align:start position:0%
this bill would do would is would apply
 
05:17:30.410 --> 05:17:30.420 align:start position:0%
the meals and rooms tax to that new
 
05:17:32.868 --> 05:17:32.878 align:start position:0%
service fee and it would apply to New
 
05:17:35.930 --> 05:17:35.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire travel agents as well
 
05:17:38.270 --> 05:17:38.280 align:start position:0%
so when you book a room or a car or a
 
05:17:39.350 --> 05:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
short-term rental on one of those
 
05:17:41.930 --> 05:17:41.940 align:start position:0%
platforms typically what happens is that
 
05:17:44.030 --> 05:17:44.040 align:start position:0%
platform collects the room rate or the
 
05:17:45.470 --> 05:17:45.480 align:start position:0%
car rental rate and all the applicable
 
05:17:48.770 --> 05:17:48.780 align:start position:0%
taxes and passes those on to the hotel
 
05:17:50.868 --> 05:17:50.878 align:start position:0%
or to the car rental company for
 
05:17:53.090 --> 05:17:53.100 align:start position:0%
remittance to the local jurisdiction or
 
05:17:55.368 --> 05:17:55.378 align:start position:0%
the state and then they also charge the
 
05:17:57.530 --> 05:17:57.540 align:start position:0%
traveler a small travel agent service
 
05:18:00.170 --> 05:18:00.180 align:start position:0%
fee that service fee will be subject to
 
05:18:02.330 --> 05:18:02.340 align:start position:0%
this new tax and that's why in my
 
05:18:04.310 --> 05:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
testimony that I that I provided in my
 
05:18:07.070 --> 05:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
Written Letter to the committee as well
 
05:18:09.590 --> 05:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
as the written testimony of the American
 
05:18:11.868 --> 05:18:11.878 align:start position:0%
Society of travel advisors we're
 
05:18:15.230 --> 05:18:15.240 align:start position:0%
concerned that the broad nature of the
 
05:18:18.050 --> 05:18:18.060 align:start position:0%
use of this tax uh that would apply to
 
05:18:20.810 --> 05:18:20.820 align:start position:0%
hotel bookings through third party and
 
05:18:23.948 --> 05:18:23.958 align:start position:0%
travel agents as well as car rentals
 
05:18:26.448 --> 05:18:26.458 align:start position:0%
would be detrimental to the state as
 
05:18:27.830 --> 05:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
you're all aware
 
05:18:30.110 --> 05:18:30.120 align:start position:0%
the pandemic has had a dramatic impact
 
05:18:31.550 --> 05:18:31.560 align:start position:0%
on the travel and tourism industry
 
05:18:35.090 --> 05:18:35.100 align:start position:0%
that's no secret to anyone and we just
 
05:18:36.708 --> 05:18:36.718 align:start position:0%
firmly believe at this point that now is
 
05:18:39.410 --> 05:18:39.420 align:start position:0%
not the time to tax any aspect of travel
 
05:18:40.550 --> 05:18:40.560 align:start position:0%
and tourism
 
05:18:43.250 --> 05:18:43.260 align:start position:0%
uh and rather look ahead towards
 
05:18:45.350 --> 05:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
recovery we think this tax will have a
 
05:18:48.050 --> 05:18:48.060 align:start position:0%
negative effect on the recovery in that
 
05:18:49.250 --> 05:18:49.260 align:start position:0%
it will make accommodations more
 
05:18:51.230 --> 05:18:51.240 align:start position:0%
expensive and even for New Hampshire
 
05:18:53.628 --> 05:18:53.638 align:start position:0%
citizens our research shows that about
 
05:18:56.390 --> 05:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
25 of hotel rooms booked on online
 
05:18:59.390 --> 05:18:59.400 align:start position:0%
travel sites are in-state bookings and
 
05:19:01.010 --> 05:19:01.020 align:start position:0%
given the pandemic and travel
 
05:19:02.628 --> 05:19:02.638 align:start position:0%
restrictions Etc we're seeing actually
 
05:19:05.390 --> 05:19:05.400 align:start position:0%
higher rates of in-state travel and so
 
05:19:08.330 --> 05:19:08.340 align:start position:0%
like all taxes this will be passed on to
 
05:19:10.190 --> 05:19:10.200 align:start position:0%
the consumer in the form of higher room
 
05:19:12.050 --> 05:19:12.060 align:start position:0%
rates higher car rental rates as those
 
05:19:14.990 --> 05:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
taxes are recalculated into the total
 
05:19:17.750 --> 05:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
cost of the trip and so I would urge you
 
05:19:20.090 --> 05:19:20.100 align:start position:0%
if the true goal of this legislation is
 
05:19:23.530 --> 05:19:23.540 align:start position:0%
to narrow the focus uh to car sharing
 
05:19:26.810 --> 05:19:26.820 align:start position:0%
then do so but the way it's drafted now
 
05:19:29.330 --> 05:19:29.340 align:start position:0%
would unnecessarily tax travel agents
 
05:19:31.788 --> 05:19:31.798 align:start position:0%
and online travel agents for everything
 
05:19:34.730 --> 05:19:34.740 align:start position:0%
from hotel hotel bookings to car rental
 
05:19:36.230 --> 05:19:36.240 align:start position:0%
companies and I'm happy to answer any
 
05:19:39.288 --> 05:19:39.298 align:start position:0%
questions I appreciate your time did you
 
05:19:41.628 --> 05:19:41.638 align:start position:0%
uh you said you said something you have
 
05:19:43.010 --> 05:19:43.020 align:start position:0%
sent something to us
 
05:19:46.070 --> 05:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
yes I did I sent a letter committee
 
05:19:48.050 --> 05:19:48.060 align:start position:0%
we'll take a look at that I know we had
 
05:19:49.368 --> 05:19:49.378 align:start position:0%
this discussion
 
05:19:52.550 --> 05:19:52.560 align:start position:0%
last year and here before uh
 
05:19:54.530 --> 05:19:54.540 align:start position:0%
well let us take a look at that um
 
05:19:57.230 --> 05:19:57.240 align:start position:0%
thanks for bringing it to our attention
 
05:19:57.240 --> 05:19:57.890 align:start position:0%
thanks for bringing it to our attention
um

05:19:57.890 --> 05:19:57.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:20:00.948 --> 05:20:00.958 align:start position:0%
thank you questions for Mr Shore
 
05:20:00.958 --> 05:20:02.350 align:start position:0%
thank you questions for Mr Shore
representative

05:20:02.350 --> 05:20:02.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:20:05.990 --> 05:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:09.650 --> 05:20:09.660 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Mr short uh I'm sure you
 
05:20:14.090 --> 05:20:14.100 align:start position:0%
heard the previous speaker on she said
 
05:20:17.448 --> 05:20:17.458 align:start position:0%
that uh they'd asked for information
 
05:20:20.030 --> 05:20:20.040 align:start position:0%
from you and how to
 
05:20:23.270 --> 05:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
um word things so that it would avoid I
 
05:20:24.830 --> 05:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
presume this issue which I don't
 
05:20:28.128 --> 05:20:28.138 align:start position:0%
remember frankly on do you have such
 
05:20:29.930 --> 05:20:29.940 align:start position:0%
language at this point to share with the
 
05:20:29.940 --> 05:20:32.208 align:start position:0%
language at this point to share with the
committee

05:20:32.208 --> 05:20:32.218 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:20:33.590 --> 05:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
um I certainly could provide that to
 
05:20:35.448 --> 05:20:35.458 align:start position:0%
many other states have as as was
 
05:20:36.890 --> 05:20:36.900 align:start position:0%
mentioned previously have have done
 
05:20:39.590 --> 05:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
something similar and again if the goal
 
05:20:43.128 --> 05:20:43.138 align:start position:0%
is to address ride sharing harsh I'm
 
05:20:45.530 --> 05:20:45.540 align:start position:0%
sorry car sharing not ride sharing
 
05:20:47.810 --> 05:20:47.820 align:start position:0%
um in this context there is a way to
 
05:20:49.430 --> 05:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
draft the legislation that doesn't
 
05:20:49.440 --> 05:20:50.690 align:start position:0%
draft the legislation that doesn't
involve

05:20:50.690 --> 05:20:50.700 align:start position:0%
involve
 
05:20:52.490 --> 05:20:52.500 align:start position:0%
traditional car rental bookings on
 
05:20:54.770 --> 05:20:54.780 align:start position:0%
platforms like Expedia and Priceline as
 
05:20:56.448 --> 05:20:56.458 align:start position:0%
well as hotel room bookings on those
 
05:20:57.890 --> 05:20:57.900 align:start position:0%
same platforms so I'd be happy to follow
 
05:20:59.090 --> 05:20:59.100 align:start position:0%
up with you and the members of the
 
05:21:01.010 --> 05:21:01.020 align:start position:0%
committee on that
 
05:21:03.050 --> 05:21:03.060 align:start position:0%
thank you you realize we don't have a
 
05:21:06.230 --> 05:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
lot of time so we need it by next week
 
05:21:08.208 --> 05:21:08.218 align:start position:0%
certainly be happy to provide that in
 
05:21:11.690 --> 05:21:11.700 align:start position:0%
that time thank you thank you Mr
 
05:21:13.550 --> 05:21:13.560 align:start position:0%

Zebo Zebo
 
05:22:14.410 --> 05:22:14.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:17.208 --> 05:22:17.218 align:start position:0%
yes committee members can you hear me
 
05:22:20.448 --> 05:22:20.458 align:start position:0%
please yes we can excellent
 
05:22:23.330 --> 05:22:23.340 align:start position:0%
my name is Carl Zabo I am vice president
 
05:22:26.208 --> 05:22:26.218 align:start position:0%
and general counsel of net choice and I
 
05:22:28.368 --> 05:22:28.378 align:start position:0%
do want to thank you all for letting me
 
05:22:29.930 --> 05:22:29.940 align:start position:0%
speak here today
 
05:22:32.390 --> 05:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
just be clear I have been fighting for
 
05:22:35.270 --> 05:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
the past decade vehemently to help
 
05:22:37.670 --> 05:22:37.680 align:start position:0%
protect New Hampshire from out of state
 
05:22:39.890 --> 05:22:39.900 align:start position:0%
overreach with respect to online sales
 
05:22:39.900 --> 05:22:41.090 align:start position:0%
overreach with respect to online sales
taxes

05:22:41.090 --> 05:22:41.100 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
05:22:45.230 --> 05:22:45.240 align:start position:0%
high five net Choice was the first group
 
05:22:47.330 --> 05:22:47.340 align:start position:0%
to bring suit against the state of South
 
05:22:49.788 --> 05:22:49.798 align:start position:0%
Dakota when they tried to Institute
 
05:22:53.030 --> 05:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
their legislation I filed an amicus
 
05:22:55.310 --> 05:22:55.320 align:start position:0%
brief at the U.S Supreme Court I've
 
05:22:58.070 --> 05:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
spoken with many of you on panels and
 
05:23:01.128 --> 05:23:01.138 align:start position:0%
stood by by you as we defend the rights
 
05:23:03.770 --> 05:23:03.780 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire residents to avoid
 
05:23:06.410 --> 05:23:06.420 align:start position:0%
unlawful taxation from other states
 
05:23:08.810 --> 05:23:08.820 align:start position:0%
and one thing I noticed that I found
 
05:23:11.570 --> 05:23:11.580 align:start position:0%
rather jarring to me today was hearing
 
05:23:13.310 --> 05:23:13.320 align:start position:0%
much of the same rhetoric
 
05:23:16.910 --> 05:23:16.920 align:start position:0%
that I fought so hard against when it
 
05:23:19.490 --> 05:23:19.500 align:start position:0%
came to online sales taxation
 
05:23:23.150 --> 05:23:23.160 align:start position:0%
when it comes to Hotel lodging Services
 
05:23:25.610 --> 05:23:25.620 align:start position:0%
Taxation and car rental
 
05:23:29.570 --> 05:23:29.580 align:start position:0%
Services Taxation and it was the Level
 
05:23:31.448 --> 05:23:31.458 align:start position:0%
Playing Field
 
05:23:34.610 --> 05:23:34.620 align:start position:0%
unfairness these were terms I heard time
 
05:23:36.050 --> 05:23:36.060 align:start position:0%
and time again for the past decade
 
05:23:37.850 --> 05:23:37.860 align:start position:0%
coming from rila and other brick and
 
05:23:40.250 --> 05:23:40.260 align:start position:0%
mortar stores as they said it's unfair
 
05:23:42.470 --> 05:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
and we need to level the playing field
 
05:23:45.470 --> 05:23:45.480 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire businesses aren't
 
05:23:49.190 --> 05:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
paying their fair share of taxes
 
05:23:51.530 --> 05:23:51.540 align:start position:0%
so once again it was very surprising and
 
05:23:54.170 --> 05:23:54.180 align:start position:0%
and uh frustrating for me to hear those
 
05:23:56.830 --> 05:23:56.840 align:start position:0%
types of phrases from my colleagues and
 
05:23:59.868 --> 05:23:59.878 align:start position:0%
uh the representatives in New Hampshire
 
05:24:01.610 --> 05:24:01.620 align:start position:0%
now speaking to the merits of this
 
05:24:05.150 --> 05:24:05.160 align:start position:0%
legislation I did submit testimony uh I
 
05:24:08.030 --> 05:24:08.040 align:start position:0%
opposed both components of it with
 
05:24:11.810 --> 05:24:11.820 align:start position:0%
respect to the hotel tax as well as the
 
05:24:14.090 --> 05:24:14.100 align:start position:0%
new tax on car rental now it is
 
05:24:16.128 --> 05:24:16.138 align:start position:0%
important to be clear that this is a new
 
05:24:19.250 --> 05:24:19.260 align:start position:0%
tax this is a new tax on services
 
05:24:20.930 --> 05:24:20.940 align:start position:0%
currently there are only three states in
 
05:24:22.730 --> 05:24:22.740 align:start position:0%
the union The Tax Services New Hampshire
 
05:24:24.910 --> 05:24:24.920 align:start position:0%
thankfully is not one of them
 
05:24:27.948 --> 05:24:27.958 align:start position:0%
but when we're talking about the
 
05:24:29.750 --> 05:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
services being provided here
 
05:24:31.250 --> 05:24:31.260 align:start position:0%
this is not where the tax is being
 
05:24:33.410 --> 05:24:33.420 align:start position:0%
applied the amount of money that it
 
05:24:36.110 --> 05:24:36.120 align:start position:0%
costs to actually rent a room in a hotel
 
05:24:39.110 --> 05:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
is being fully taxed today what we're
 
05:24:41.570 --> 05:24:41.580 align:start position:0%
talking about is applying a new tax to
 
05:24:43.250 --> 05:24:43.260 align:start position:0%
any additional Services provided by
 
05:24:45.470 --> 05:24:45.480 align:start position:0%
travel agencies whether it's the service
 
05:24:47.270 --> 05:24:47.280 align:start position:0%
fee they charge to basically make a
 
05:24:47.280 --> 05:24:48.470 align:start position:0%
fee they charge to basically make a
living

05:24:48.470 --> 05:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
living
 
05:24:51.170 --> 05:24:51.180 align:start position:0%
called their service fee whether it's a
 
05:24:53.750 --> 05:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
new tax on part of a bundled provision
 
05:24:55.490 --> 05:24:55.500 align:start position:0%
so you would still get the occupancy tax
 
05:24:57.708 --> 05:24:57.718 align:start position:0%
on a hotel room but if we combine that
 
05:25:00.650 --> 05:25:00.660 align:start position:0%
now with lift tickets or transportation
 
05:25:03.830 --> 05:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
to ski slopes that's now being taxed at
 
05:25:05.868 --> 05:25:05.878 align:start position:0%
the occupancy rate that's the effort
 
05:25:08.270 --> 05:25:08.280 align:start position:0%
that's being sought here and it's being
 
05:25:10.850 --> 05:25:10.860 align:start position:0%
pushed by big hotels and why do they
 
05:25:12.530 --> 05:25:12.540 align:start position:0%
want to push this because they don't
 
05:25:15.170 --> 05:25:15.180 align:start position:0%
want you using small travel agents they
 
05:25:16.850 --> 05:25:16.860 align:start position:0%
don't want you using online travel agent
 
05:25:19.070 --> 05:25:19.080 align:start position:0%
websites they want you going directly to
 
05:25:20.868 --> 05:25:20.878 align:start position:0%
marriott.com and not finding those
 
05:25:22.490 --> 05:25:22.500 align:start position:0%
boutique hotels who can't otherwise
 
05:25:24.050 --> 05:25:24.060 align:start position:0%
break out
 
05:25:27.110 --> 05:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
on the car sharing side
 
05:25:29.510 --> 05:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
you heard from Hertz well we just want a
 
05:25:31.910 --> 05:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
fair playing field Level Playing Field
 
05:25:31.920 --> 05:25:33.830 align:start position:0%
fair playing field Level Playing Field
fairness

05:25:33.830 --> 05:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
fairness
 
05:25:36.770 --> 05:25:36.780 align:start position:0%
the number of cars that Tura owns today
 
05:25:40.190 --> 05:25:40.200 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire is zero
 
05:25:43.788 --> 05:25:43.798 align:start position:0%
the number of car rental locations they
 
05:25:46.730 --> 05:25:46.740 align:start position:0%
have at the airports is zero essentially
 
05:25:48.650 --> 05:25:48.660 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about is applying a
 
05:25:52.250 --> 05:25:52.260 align:start position:0%
new tax to the basic action when a
 
05:25:54.288 --> 05:25:54.298 align:start position:0%
neighbor says can I borrow your truck
 
05:25:56.810 --> 05:25:56.820 align:start position:0%
now I do appreciate the fact that you
 
05:25:58.970 --> 05:25:58.980 align:start position:0%
did include in subsection 7 exemption
 
05:26:00.530 --> 05:26:00.540 align:start position:0%
that you can't go after the individuals
 
05:26:03.708 --> 05:26:03.718 align:start position:0%
of your state for the collection of
 
05:26:05.868 --> 05:26:05.878 align:start position:0%
these taxes however with the broad
 
05:26:08.930 --> 05:26:08.940 align:start position:0%
definition included in the legislation
 
05:26:14.330 --> 05:26:14.340 align:start position:0%
of the terms of rental uh service
 
05:26:16.670 --> 05:26:16.680 align:start position:0%
it could easily be applied
 
05:26:18.650 --> 05:26:18.660 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire residents and the term
 
05:26:19.970 --> 05:26:19.980 align:start position:0%
I was referring to is rental
 
05:26:23.090 --> 05:26:23.100 align:start position:0%
facilitators so broadly written that if
 
05:26:24.770 --> 05:26:24.780 align:start position:0%
I were the Department of Taxation I
 
05:26:26.208 --> 05:26:26.218 align:start position:0%
could easily make that apply to New
 
05:26:27.590 --> 05:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens
 
05:26:29.390 --> 05:26:29.400 align:start position:0%
I would ask that you not Advance this
 
05:26:30.948 --> 05:26:30.958 align:start position:0%
bill I do appreciate the fact that it
 
05:26:32.750 --> 05:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
has been worked on for three years but
 
05:26:34.430 --> 05:26:34.440 align:start position:0%
that doesn't necessarily make it a bill
 
05:26:37.128 --> 05:26:37.138 align:start position:0%
worthy of moving forward to answer uh
 
05:26:39.230 --> 05:26:39.240 align:start position:0%
representative almi's question about do
 
05:26:41.570 --> 05:26:41.580 align:start position:0%
we have recommended language I did
 
05:26:44.030 --> 05:26:44.040 align:start position:0%
include in my testimony two
 
05:26:45.530 --> 05:26:45.540 align:start position:0%
possibilities of recommended language
 
05:26:49.128 --> 05:26:49.138 align:start position:0%
with respect to the uh Hotel occupancy
 
05:26:51.830 --> 05:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
tax agent component and they both come
 
05:26:54.708 --> 05:26:54.718 align:start position:0%
as models from Alec who has repeatedly
 
05:26:57.650 --> 05:26:57.660 align:start position:0%
stood against these forms of new taxes
 
05:27:00.230 --> 05:27:00.240 align:start position:0%
I was trying to be fast and I covered a
 
05:27:02.330 --> 05:27:02.340 align:start position:0%
lot so I welcome any questions you may
 
05:27:05.090 --> 05:27:05.100 align:start position:0%
have thank you for your testimony uh are
 
05:27:07.970 --> 05:27:07.980 align:start position:0%
there any hands up not in the room any
 
05:27:10.910 --> 05:27:10.920 align:start position:0%
uh any hands up
 
05:27:14.330 --> 05:27:14.340 align:start position:0%
okay yes representative
 
05:27:19.190 --> 05:27:19.200 align:start position:0%
um what types of taxes online
 
05:27:22.010 --> 05:27:22.020 align:start position:0%
uh businesses like yours or the ones you
 
05:27:25.368 --> 05:27:25.378 align:start position:0%
represent pay and in what states and how
 
05:27:27.650 --> 05:27:27.660 align:start position:0%
do you do how is it decided what state
 
05:27:29.570 --> 05:27:29.580 align:start position:0%
it's paid to
 
05:27:31.788 --> 05:27:31.798 align:start position:0%
that was that was representative Camaro
 
05:27:33.770 --> 05:27:33.780 align:start position:0%
by the way yes thank you thank you
 
05:27:36.110 --> 05:27:36.120 align:start position:0%
representative excellent question so
 
05:27:37.730 --> 05:27:37.740 align:start position:0%
just to be clear
 
05:27:40.368 --> 05:27:40.378 align:start position:0%
the uh taxes are always paid so let's
 
05:27:43.550 --> 05:27:43.560 align:start position:0%
use the example of hotels if I were to
 
05:27:46.128 --> 05:27:46.138 align:start position:0%
go and use a travel agent
 
05:27:49.070 --> 05:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
to book a hotel in New Hampshire
 
05:27:51.708 --> 05:27:51.718 align:start position:0%
that hotel and let's presume the cost of
 
05:27:53.810 --> 05:27:53.820 align:start position:0%
the hotel is eighty dollars
 
05:27:55.250 --> 05:27:55.260 align:start position:0%
for the room
 
05:27:58.670 --> 05:27:58.680 align:start position:0%
a hundred percent of the hotel occupancy
 
05:28:01.550 --> 05:28:01.560 align:start position:0%
tax on that eighty dollars is paid
 
05:28:03.830 --> 05:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
now if my travel agent here in Maryland
 
05:28:06.650 --> 05:28:06.660 align:start position:0%
charged me five additional dollars for a
 
05:28:10.430 --> 05:28:10.440 align:start position:0%
total of it will be 88 dollars for the
 
05:28:11.810 --> 05:28:11.820 align:start position:0%
room because that includes the occupancy
 
05:28:13.610 --> 05:28:13.620 align:start position:0%
tax plus five and they bundle that all
 
05:28:13.620 --> 05:28:15.110 align:start position:0%
tax plus five and they bundle that all
together

05:28:15.110 --> 05:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
together
 
05:28:17.410 --> 05:28:17.420 align:start position:0%
the five dollar tax for that service
 
05:28:19.610 --> 05:28:19.620 align:start position:0%
since they are not a resident of New
 
05:28:21.830 --> 05:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would not be paid by New
 
05:28:24.948 --> 05:28:24.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire now a lot of people especially
 
05:28:26.868 --> 05:28:26.878 align:start position:0%
those outside of the great state of New
 
05:28:28.788 --> 05:28:28.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire have tried to make it seem as
 
05:28:30.590 --> 05:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
though the Wayfarer decision has let
 
05:28:32.448 --> 05:28:32.458 align:start position:0%
loose the tax collectors from every
 
05:28:34.970 --> 05:28:34.980 align:start position:0%
foreign state that is not the case that
 
05:28:37.670 --> 05:28:37.680 align:start position:0%
decision is narrowly tailored to sales
 
05:28:39.708 --> 05:28:39.718 align:start position:0%
tax and what we were talking about are
 
05:28:41.990 --> 05:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
issues well outside the area of sales
 
05:28:43.850 --> 05:28:43.860 align:start position:0%
tax we are talking essentially about
 
05:28:46.970 --> 05:28:46.980 align:start position:0%
business service taxes and I can promise
 
05:28:49.128 --> 05:28:49.138 align:start position:0%
you you do not want in New Hampshire
 
05:28:50.868 --> 05:28:50.878 align:start position:0%
other states Reaching Across their
 
05:28:52.430 --> 05:28:52.440 align:start position:0%
borders and trying to apply their
 
05:28:54.170 --> 05:28:54.180 align:start position:0%
business service or business activity
 
05:28:56.570 --> 05:28:56.580 align:start position:0%
taxes to New Hampshire businesses
 
05:28:57.948 --> 05:28:57.958 align:start position:0%
because that's essentially what we're
 
05:29:01.510 --> 05:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:05.150 --> 05:29:05.160 align:start position:0%
any other questions any other hands up
 
05:29:08.150 --> 05:29:08.160 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Mr Zebo
 
05:29:09.948 --> 05:29:09.958 align:start position:0%
we'll take a look at your written
 
05:29:13.250 --> 05:29:13.260 align:start position:0%
testimony as well thank you thank you
 
05:29:17.390 --> 05:29:17.400 align:start position:0%
okay next up is uh John Olson
 
05:29:20.330 --> 05:29:20.340 align:start position:0%
who's with any internet Association in
 
05:29:22.190 --> 05:29:22.200 align:start position:0%
the opposition of the bill and uh for
 
05:29:24.230 --> 05:29:24.240 align:start position:0%
the committee I'm going to step away for
 
05:29:25.788 --> 05:29:25.798 align:start position:0%
a second and representative is going to
 
05:29:27.288 --> 05:29:27.298 align:start position:0%
take over
 
05:29:33.470 --> 05:29:33.480 align:start position:0%

thank you chair and members of the
 
05:29:40.250 --> 05:29:40.260 align:start position:0%
committee my name is John Olson I'm the
 
05:29:41.570 --> 05:29:41.580 align:start position:0%
regional director for the internet
 
05:29:44.570 --> 05:29:44.580 align:start position:0%
Association representing the Northeast
 
05:29:47.390 --> 05:29:47.400 align:start position:0%
um I represent most of the companies uh
 
05:29:49.490 --> 05:29:49.500 align:start position:0%
this tax would apply to with respect to
 
05:29:53.448 --> 05:29:53.458 align:start position:0%
Expedia Airbnb anturo
 
05:29:55.910 --> 05:29:55.920 align:start position:0%
um I will refrain from repeating my
 
05:29:57.650 --> 05:29:57.660 align:start position:0%
written testimony I submitted last night
 
05:29:59.570 --> 05:29:59.580 align:start position:0%
so you should have had time to look at
 
05:30:01.970 --> 05:30:01.980 align:start position:0%
it I would just say from my perspective
 
05:30:05.330 --> 05:30:05.340 align:start position:0%
uh representing the internet industry
 
05:30:06.890 --> 05:30:06.900 align:start position:0%
um you know this is a very unique time
 
05:30:09.948 --> 05:30:09.958 align:start position:0%
we are still under the throes of a
 
05:30:12.050 --> 05:30:12.060 align:start position:0%
pandemic and experiencing economic
 
05:30:14.868 --> 05:30:14.878 align:start position:0%
recovery across the states uh and I
 
05:30:16.910 --> 05:30:16.920 align:start position:0%
don't think that's any less true in New
 
05:30:16.920 --> 05:30:17.628 align:start position:0%
don't think that's any less true in New
Hampshire

05:30:17.628 --> 05:30:17.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
05:30:21.170 --> 05:30:21.180 align:start position:0%
uh generally the services that this
 
05:30:23.570 --> 05:30:23.580 align:start position:0%
rooms and meals tax would be applied to
 
05:30:27.350 --> 05:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
have become uh almost a Lifeline to New
 
05:30:29.628 --> 05:30:29.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents in general I think
 
05:30:33.288 --> 05:30:33.298 align:start position:0%
the car sharing aspect has allowed most
 
05:30:35.750 --> 05:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
new New Hampshire residents that utilize
 
05:30:38.868 --> 05:30:38.878 align:start position:0%
turo and other car sharing platforms to
 
05:30:42.230 --> 05:30:42.240 align:start position:0%
help offset a significant liability in
 
05:30:44.810 --> 05:30:44.820 align:start position:0%
the form of their vehicle I think the
 
05:30:47.330 --> 05:30:47.340 align:start position:0%
same can be said for renting out rooms
 
05:30:50.208 --> 05:30:50.218 align:start position:0%
or second homes through travel platforms
 
05:30:54.650 --> 05:30:54.660 align:start position:0%
such as the rbo HomeAway or Airbnb uh in
 
05:30:56.448 --> 05:30:56.458 align:start position:0%
general as Carl mentioned previously
 
05:30:59.510 --> 05:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
this is a new tax and it's likely a tax
 
05:31:02.150 --> 05:31:02.160 align:start position:0%
that will either directly be impacting
 
05:31:05.090 --> 05:31:05.100 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents or you know pass
 
05:31:07.368 --> 05:31:07.378 align:start position:0%
the cost along to them for using these
 
05:31:10.430 --> 05:31:10.440 align:start position:0%
platforms uh so I would just ask the
 
05:31:12.288 --> 05:31:12.298 align:start position:0%
committee uh to consider you know the
 
05:31:14.270 --> 05:31:14.280 align:start position:0%
current environment is this the right
 
05:31:17.750 --> 05:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
time to uh to assess new fees and taxes
 
05:31:20.930 --> 05:31:20.940 align:start position:0%
on New Hampshire residents and is it
 
05:31:24.170 --> 05:31:24.180 align:start position:0%
really a wise decision to use the
 
05:31:25.670 --> 05:31:25.680 align:start position:0%
platforms as a means of generating
 
05:31:28.610 --> 05:31:28.620 align:start position:0%
Revenue when they become almost the
 
05:31:32.628 --> 05:31:32.638 align:start position:0%
exclusive ability for uh folks in the in
 
05:31:34.970 --> 05:31:34.980 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and other states from uh
 
05:31:36.470 --> 05:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
from making a living or earning
 
05:31:38.150 --> 05:31:38.160 align:start position:0%
supplemental income
 
05:31:40.010 --> 05:31:40.020 align:start position:0%
and I welcome any questions related to
 
05:31:43.550 --> 05:31:43.560 align:start position:0%
that or my written testimony thank you
 
05:31:52.610 --> 05:31:52.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:56.868 --> 05:31:56.878 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh Mr Olson did
 
05:31:56.878 --> 05:31:57.770 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh Mr Olson did
you

05:31:57.770 --> 05:31:57.780 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:32:00.890 --> 05:32:00.900 align:start position:0%
um do you have any idea how many much
 
05:32:03.230 --> 05:32:03.240 align:start position:0%
business tarot does in this state yet
 
05:32:06.110 --> 05:32:06.120 align:start position:0%
because when we discussed this last year
 
05:32:08.330 --> 05:32:08.340 align:start position:0%
as I recall there wasn't
 
05:32:11.628 --> 05:32:11.638 align:start position:0%
so he could wasn't sure we had he had
 
05:32:15.350 --> 05:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
any customers at all in New Hampshire uh
 
05:32:17.448 --> 05:32:17.458 align:start position:0%
they were just trying to make sure we
 
05:32:19.670 --> 05:32:19.680 align:start position:0%
didn't set a precedent which apparently
 
05:32:21.288 --> 05:32:21.298 align:start position:0%
has been set
 
05:32:24.410 --> 05:32:24.420 align:start position:0%
I I don't believe that's correct I think
 
05:32:26.930 --> 05:32:26.940 align:start position:0%
the number from at least last year was
 
05:32:29.208 --> 05:32:29.218 align:start position:0%
around 4 000 residents utilizing the
 
05:32:32.570 --> 05:32:32.580 align:start position:0%
platform I can only imagine it's grown
 
05:32:35.628 --> 05:32:35.638 align:start position:0%
um you know I think you find that
 
05:32:38.570 --> 05:32:38.580 align:start position:0%
cars have become pretty expensive and
 
05:32:38.580 --> 05:32:40.850 align:start position:0%
cars have become pretty expensive and
almost

05:32:40.850 --> 05:32:40.860 align:start position:0%
almost
 
05:32:43.550 --> 05:32:43.560 align:start position:0%
useless piece of property for some
 
05:32:46.910 --> 05:32:46.920 align:start position:0%
people but you know there are others who
 
05:32:49.250 --> 05:32:49.260 align:start position:0%
like to travel and find it the most
 
05:32:52.490 --> 05:32:52.500 align:start position:0%
affordable means of obtaining a car that
 
05:32:54.890 --> 05:32:54.900 align:start position:0%
they may not otherwise have so I don't
 
05:32:56.390 --> 05:32:56.400 align:start position:0%
think it's correct to say there are no
 
05:32:58.970 --> 05:32:58.980 align:start position:0%
customers in in New Hampshire and I
 
05:33:00.890 --> 05:33:00.900 align:start position:0%
imagine there may be someone from turo
 
05:33:03.650 --> 05:33:03.660 align:start position:0%
testifying today if not that information
 
05:33:07.190 --> 05:33:07.200 align:start position:0%
can readily be given to you but in
 
05:33:08.628 --> 05:33:08.638 align:start position:0%
general I would say New Hampshire does
 
05:33:11.510 --> 05:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
have many people using turo and using it
 
05:33:13.670 --> 05:33:13.680 align:start position:0%
to uh to supplement their income in some
 
05:33:13.680 --> 05:33:16.430 align:start position:0%
to uh to supplement their income in some
respects

05:33:16.430 --> 05:33:16.440 align:start position:0%
respects
 
05:33:22.490 --> 05:33:22.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:25.850 --> 05:33:25.860 align:start position:0%

05:34:28.910 --> 05:34:28.920 align:start position:0%
this opportunity to testify today Mr
 
05:34:30.590 --> 05:34:30.600 align:start position:0%
chair members of the committee my name
 
05:34:33.350 --> 05:34:33.360 align:start position:0%
is moral Weston and I am testifying
 
05:34:35.628 --> 05:34:35.638 align:start position:0%
today on behalf of turo which is an
 
05:34:37.910 --> 05:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
internet-based peer-to-peer car sharing
 
05:34:41.090 --> 05:34:41.100 align:start position:0%
platform I submitted written testimony
 
05:34:42.708 --> 05:34:42.718 align:start position:0%
for the record last evening so you
 
05:34:45.530 --> 05:34:45.540 align:start position:0%
should have that for your review
 
05:34:49.368 --> 05:34:49.378 align:start position:0%
we testify today in opposition to HB 15.
 
05:34:51.708 --> 05:34:51.718 align:start position:0%
however I want to stress that my client
 
05:34:53.690 --> 05:34:53.700 align:start position:0%
and I are willing to work with the
 
05:34:56.150 --> 05:34:56.160 align:start position:0%
committee on developing a fair way to
 
05:34:59.448 --> 05:34:59.458 align:start position:0%
address peer-to-peer car sharing as a
 
05:35:01.910 --> 05:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
unique business model without creating
 
05:35:05.270 --> 05:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
overly burdensome barriers to entry
 
05:35:07.368 --> 05:35:07.378 align:start position:0%
turo is an internet platform that
 
05:35:09.288 --> 05:35:09.298 align:start position:0%
provides a service
 
05:35:12.530 --> 05:35:12.540 align:start position:0%
a service so that car owner hosts can
 
05:35:14.510 --> 05:35:14.520 align:start position:0%
list their vehicles for sharing with
 
05:35:17.150 --> 05:35:17.160 align:start position:0%
guests in need of a vehicle
 
05:35:19.128 --> 05:35:19.138 align:start position:0%
turo's peer-to-peer car sharing
 
05:35:21.230 --> 05:35:21.240 align:start position:0%
Marketplace enables New Hampshire
 
05:35:23.090 --> 05:35:23.100 align:start position:0%
citizens to share their personal car
 
05:35:25.550 --> 05:35:25.560 align:start position:0%
with neighbors or members of their
 
05:35:25.560 --> 05:35:26.810 align:start position:0%
with neighbors or members of their
community

05:35:26.810 --> 05:35:26.820 align:start position:0%
community
 
05:35:30.110 --> 05:35:30.120 align:start position:0%
this Marketplace as I said provides a
 
05:35:33.230 --> 05:35:33.240 align:start position:0%
service it's an economic opportunity for
 
05:35:35.930 --> 05:35:35.940 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire car owners to earn a small
 
05:35:38.208 --> 05:35:38.218 align:start position:0%
amount of extra income
 
05:35:40.730 --> 05:35:40.740 align:start position:0%
it also provides drivers in search of
 
05:35:43.550 --> 05:35:43.560 align:start position:0%
Mobility options or specific type of
 
05:35:45.948 --> 05:35:45.958 align:start position:0%
vehicle a solution
 
05:35:47.990 --> 05:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
when you think about the implications of
 
05:35:49.970 --> 05:35:49.980 align:start position:0%
this bill think about the New Hampshire
 
05:35:52.610 --> 05:35:52.620 align:start position:0%
citizen who's the host think about
 
05:35:55.070 --> 05:35:55.080 align:start position:0%
perhaps the college student who may only
 
05:35:57.410 --> 05:35:57.420 align:start position:0%
need to use a car two days a week for
 
05:35:59.810 --> 05:35:59.820 align:start position:0%
his or her internship and wants to
 
05:36:01.730 --> 05:36:01.740 align:start position:0%
offset a bit of their debt
 
05:36:04.190 --> 05:36:04.200 align:start position:0%
or think about the family who's cleaning
 
05:36:06.590 --> 05:36:06.600 align:start position:0%
out their basement and may perhaps like
 
05:36:08.448 --> 05:36:08.458 align:start position:0%
to share a pickup truck for a day but
 
05:36:10.670 --> 05:36:10.680 align:start position:0%
otherwise couldn't afford one
 
05:36:14.030 --> 05:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
or think about the retiree on fixed
 
05:36:16.250 --> 05:36:16.260 align:start position:0%
income who doesn't need to use their car
 
05:36:18.650 --> 05:36:18.660 align:start position:0%
every day of the week and could use a
 
05:36:20.510 --> 05:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
small bit of extra money to help make
 
05:36:22.788 --> 05:36:22.798 align:start position:0%
ends meet
 
05:36:25.730 --> 05:36:25.740 align:start position:0%
peer-to-peer car sharing can also be a
 
05:36:28.610 --> 05:36:28.620 align:start position:0%
great resource in rural areas where
 
05:36:30.350 --> 05:36:30.360 align:start position:0%
access to public transportation simply
 
05:36:32.570 --> 05:36:32.580 align:start position:0%
does not exist
 
05:36:35.868 --> 05:36:35.878 align:start position:0%
neither tarot nor our host our car
 
05:36:37.730 --> 05:36:37.740 align:start position:0%
rental companies
 
05:36:40.788 --> 05:36:40.798 align:start position:0%
neither should be taxed or regulated as
 
05:36:44.868 --> 05:36:44.878 align:start position:0%
one to be clear turo owns no vehicles
 
05:36:47.208 --> 05:36:47.218 align:start position:0%
there is no Fleet
 
05:36:49.730 --> 05:36:49.740 align:start position:0%
the vehicles that are shared are owned
 
05:36:53.510 --> 05:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
by individual New Hampshire citizens
 
05:36:56.030 --> 05:36:56.040 align:start position:0%
we do oppose House Bill 15 because we
 
05:36:57.948 --> 05:36:57.958 align:start position:0%
believe it does in fact create a new tax
 
05:37:00.230 --> 05:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
on New Hampshire citizens who choose to
 
05:37:01.368 --> 05:37:01.378 align:start position:0%
share their car
 
05:37:03.910 --> 05:37:03.920 align:start position:0%
this is akin to taxing a family's
 
05:37:07.310 --> 05:37:07.320 align:start position:0%
neighborhood lemonade stand as if they
 
05:37:09.170 --> 05:37:09.180 align:start position:0%
were Minute Maid
 
05:37:11.990 --> 05:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
currently to answer representative Ami's
 
05:37:16.250 --> 05:37:16.260 align:start position:0%
question there are about 400 turo hosts
 
05:37:17.510 --> 05:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
05:37:20.030 --> 05:37:20.040 align:start position:0%
and those average host earnings per
 
05:37:22.448 --> 05:37:22.458 align:start position:0%
month are around three hundred dollars
 
05:37:26.030 --> 05:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
we are talking about just a small amount
 
05:37:28.550 --> 05:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
of extra income for people who are
 
05:37:33.288 --> 05:37:33.298 align:start position:0%
looking to offset debt or make ends meet
 
05:37:36.590 --> 05:37:36.600 align:start position:0%
in addition to imposing this new tax
 
05:37:39.350 --> 05:37:39.360 align:start position:0%
the bill and relevant regulations would
 
05:37:41.990 --> 05:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
require any operator
 
05:37:44.690 --> 05:37:44.700 align:start position:0%
or host to register with the Department
 
05:37:46.310 --> 05:37:46.320 align:start position:0%
of Revenue and provide the name and
 
05:37:47.810 --> 05:37:47.820 align:start position:0%
place of their business within the state
 
05:37:50.510 --> 05:37:50.520 align:start position:0%
I believe those licenses also have to be
 
05:37:50.520 --> 05:37:51.890 align:start position:0%
I believe those licenses also have to be
posted

05:37:51.890 --> 05:37:51.900 align:start position:0%
posted
 
05:37:54.708 --> 05:37:54.718 align:start position:0%
the Taxation and regulation imposed by
 
05:37:56.868 --> 05:37:56.878 align:start position:0%
this bill is government interference
 
05:38:00.350 --> 05:38:00.360 align:start position:0%
with the use of personal property
 
05:38:03.170 --> 05:38:03.180 align:start position:0%
for all practical purposes this bill
 
05:38:06.050 --> 05:38:06.060 align:start position:0%
would shut down the opportunity for
 
05:38:07.368 --> 05:38:07.378 align:start position:0%
peer-to-peer car sharing in New
 
05:38:07.378 --> 05:38:08.628 align:start position:0%
peer-to-peer car sharing in New
Hampshire

05:38:08.628 --> 05:38:08.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
05:38:10.670 --> 05:38:10.680 align:start position:0%
if New Hampshire wants to address
 
05:38:13.070 --> 05:38:13.080 align:start position:0%
peer-to-peer car sharing we suggest
 
05:38:15.708 --> 05:38:15.718 align:start position:0%
consideration of the 2019 and coil model
 
05:38:15.718 --> 05:38:16.610 align:start position:0%
consideration of the 2019 and coil model
bill

05:38:16.610 --> 05:38:16.620 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:38:19.310 --> 05:38:19.320 align:start position:0%
the end coil model provides a regulatory
 
05:38:21.230 --> 05:38:21.240 align:start position:0%
framework for peer-to-peer car sharing
 
05:38:25.090 --> 05:38:25.100 align:start position:0%
many states I believe approximately 14
 
05:38:27.708 --> 05:38:27.718 align:start position:0%
currently have peer-to-peer car sharing
 
05:38:30.890 --> 05:38:30.900 align:start position:0%
laws on the books there is significant
 
05:38:33.410 --> 05:38:33.420 align:start position:0%
precedence for treating peer-to-peer car
 
05:38:36.890 --> 05:38:36.900 align:start position:0%
sharing as distinct and different from
 
05:38:38.570 --> 05:38:38.580 align:start position:0%
car rental companies
 
05:38:42.770 --> 05:38:42.780 align:start position:0%
uh the end coil model does that there is
 
05:38:45.410 --> 05:38:45.420 align:start position:0%
a background from the U.S department of
 
05:38:47.868 --> 05:38:47.878 align:start position:0%
transportation that distinguishes those
 
05:38:49.788 --> 05:38:49.798 align:start position:0%
two industries and we would encourage
 
05:38:52.850 --> 05:38:52.860 align:start position:0%
you to look at that and follow that lead
 
05:38:55.788 --> 05:38:55.798 align:start position:0%
so today we respectfully oppose House
 
05:38:58.788 --> 05:38:58.798 align:start position:0%
Bill 15 the new tax it would impose on
 
05:39:00.830 --> 05:39:00.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire citizens but we would be
 
05:39:03.288 --> 05:39:03.298 align:start position:0%
happy to continue to work with you on
 
05:39:07.190 --> 05:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
alternative approaches thank you
 
05:39:08.460 --> 05:39:08.470 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:39:08.470 --> 05:39:10.610 align:start position:0%
thank you
[Music]

05:39:10.610 --> 05:39:10.620 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:39:10.620 --> 05:39:20.510 align:start position:0%
[Music]
certainly

05:39:20.510 --> 05:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:23.390 --> 05:39:23.400 align:start position:0%
did you I'm sorry did you call on me Mr
 
05:39:25.610 --> 05:39:25.620 align:start position:0%
Speaker or Mr chairman
 
05:39:28.430 --> 05:39:28.440 align:start position:0%
well I call on
 
05:39:31.670 --> 05:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
okay okay sorry you're sorry chairman
 
05:39:33.110 --> 05:39:33.120 align:start position:0%
you're you're just you're a little fuzzy
 
05:39:34.490 --> 05:39:34.500 align:start position:0%
you're hard to hear
 
05:39:36.170 --> 05:39:36.180 align:start position:0%
um but thank you
 
05:39:38.810 --> 05:39:38.820 align:start position:0%
um Ms Weston thank you so much for your
 
05:39:40.310 --> 05:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
testimony I'm just gonna be really
 
05:39:41.868 --> 05:39:41.878 align:start position:0%
honest I've been in the hospitality
 
05:39:44.810 --> 05:39:44.820 align:start position:0%
industry for over 25 years and I'm
 
05:39:48.350 --> 05:39:48.360 align:start position:0%
actually a customer of churro I'm having
 
05:39:50.930 --> 05:39:50.940 align:start position:0%
difficulty with your testimony just
 
05:39:55.190 --> 05:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
because turo is known as the Airbnb of
 
05:39:59.090 --> 05:39:59.100 align:start position:0%
cars and the fact that you both have a
 
05:40:01.970 --> 05:40:01.980 align:start position:0%
very similar business model of not
 
05:40:04.490 --> 05:40:04.500 align:start position:0%
owning a fleet not holding and then
 
05:40:07.910 --> 05:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
Airbnb doesn't own any hotel rooms or
 
05:40:11.930 --> 05:40:11.940 align:start position:0%
any rooms you're both providing Services
 
05:40:14.810 --> 05:40:14.820 align:start position:0%
um I stay at airbnbs when I travel and I
 
05:40:17.690 --> 05:40:17.700 align:start position:0%
use Toro so I'm very familiar with both
 
05:40:17.700 --> 05:40:19.990 align:start position:0%
use Toro so I'm very familiar with both
services

05:40:19.990 --> 05:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
services
 
05:40:23.208 --> 05:40:23.218 align:start position:0%
Airbnb pays taxes
 
05:40:26.030 --> 05:40:26.040 align:start position:0%
um they pay into the meals and rentals
 
05:40:30.050 --> 05:40:30.060 align:start position:0%
tax so my question to you is why do you
 
05:40:33.890 --> 05:40:33.900 align:start position:0%
think Airbnb should but turo shouldn't
 
05:40:38.330 --> 05:40:38.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:42.470 --> 05:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
I I believe I believe that Airbnb uh
 
05:40:44.510 --> 05:40:44.520 align:start position:0%
entered into an agreement with the
 
05:40:46.010 --> 05:40:46.020 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue on their own
 
05:40:49.788 --> 05:40:49.798 align:start position:0%
accord and in fact this bill
 
05:40:52.550 --> 05:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
um would extend to entities similar to
 
05:40:55.970 --> 05:40:55.980 align:start position:0%
Airbnb and other platforms
 
05:40:59.390 --> 05:40:59.400 align:start position:0%
um so we oppose the bill and we do
 
05:41:03.050 --> 05:41:03.060 align:start position:0%
distinguish our service from Airbnb and
 
05:41:04.368 --> 05:41:04.378 align:start position:0%
airbnb's made their own business
 
05:41:04.378 --> 05:41:05.628 align:start position:0%
airbnb's made their own business
decisions

05:41:05.628 --> 05:41:05.638 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
05:41:07.730 --> 05:41:07.740 align:start position:0%
um and
 
05:41:11.030 --> 05:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
um I can't speak for them but we have a
 
05:41:14.570 --> 05:41:14.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:17.208 --> 05:41:17.218 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative Dennis
 
05:41:17.218 --> 05:41:18.470 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative Dennis
Maloney

05:41:18.470 --> 05:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
Maloney
 
05:41:21.230 --> 05:41:21.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
05:41:23.270 --> 05:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
05:41:28.490 --> 05:41:28.500 align:start position:0%
um and I I I I apologize if this
 
05:41:30.708 --> 05:41:30.718 align:start position:0%
comes across as
 
05:41:30.718 --> 05:41:33.670 align:start position:0%
comes across as
um

05:41:33.670 --> 05:41:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:37.070 --> 05:41:37.080 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to be very delicate here uh
 
05:41:39.770 --> 05:41:39.780 align:start position:0%
in the committee work that we did on
 
05:41:44.090 --> 05:41:44.100 align:start position:0%
this bill last term if I'm not mistaken
 
05:41:47.770 --> 05:41:47.780 align:start position:0%
we were presented with printed material
 
05:41:51.410 --> 05:41:51.420 align:start position:0%
advertising material that said true or
 
05:41:53.690 --> 05:41:53.700 align:start position:0%
is a car rental company it said that on
 
05:41:55.610 --> 05:41:55.620 align:start position:0%
this I might be mistaken I might be not
 
05:41:59.270 --> 05:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
uh remembering quite clearly enough but
 
05:42:02.208 --> 05:42:02.218 align:start position:0%
in your testimony you said turo uh you
 
05:42:05.270 --> 05:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
are not you are not a car rental company
 
05:42:08.030 --> 05:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
so I would ask you to
 
05:42:11.990 --> 05:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
if you would please uh reconcile those
 
05:42:15.050 --> 05:42:15.060 align:start position:0%
statements if they need reconciliation
 
05:42:18.170 --> 05:42:18.180 align:start position:0%
thank you very much sure I'm happy to do
 
05:42:19.970 --> 05:42:19.980 align:start position:0%
my best I recall that representative
 
05:42:22.910 --> 05:42:22.920 align:start position:0%
Packard held up some materials last
 
05:42:27.050 --> 05:42:27.060 align:start position:0%
session that used the word rental and
 
05:42:30.770 --> 05:42:30.780 align:start position:0%
you know there aren't too many ways to
 
05:42:30.780 --> 05:42:31.970 align:start position:0%
you know there aren't too many ways to
describe

05:42:31.970 --> 05:42:31.980 align:start position:0%
describe
 
05:42:34.670 --> 05:42:34.680 align:start position:0%
uh the sharing of something or the use
 
05:42:37.190 --> 05:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
of something for consideration
 
05:42:40.850 --> 05:42:40.860 align:start position:0%
um so if the term rental is used on the
 
05:42:44.330 --> 05:42:44.340 align:start position:0%
turo website it is it's because a host
 
05:42:46.190 --> 05:42:46.200 align:start position:0%
is looking to share its car for
 
05:42:46.200 --> 05:42:48.050 align:start position:0%
is looking to share its car for
consideration

05:42:48.050 --> 05:42:48.060 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
05:42:50.570 --> 05:42:50.580 align:start position:0%
um that's the colloquial word would be
 
05:42:54.410 --> 05:42:54.420 align:start position:0%
rent that doesn't make turo itself a car
 
05:42:57.350 --> 05:42:57.360 align:start position:0%
rental company we don't have a fleet we
 
05:42:59.930 --> 05:42:59.940 align:start position:0%
don't own cars we don't rent the cars we
 
05:43:03.230 --> 05:43:03.240 align:start position:0%
provide a service to our hosts
 
05:43:08.030 --> 05:43:08.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:10.970 --> 05:43:10.980 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you we'll

hello Mr chair Carolyn Lear assistant

commissioner at the department of rev I

apologize I couldn't answer your
 
05:45:08.570 --> 05:45:08.580 align:start position:0%
question because I wasn't yet unmuted
 
05:45:08.580 --> 05:45:09.470 align:start position:0%
question because I wasn't yet unmuted
um

05:45:09.470 --> 05:45:09.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:45:12.230 --> 05:45:12.240 align:start position:0%
very happy to just quickly uh talk to
 
05:45:15.410 --> 05:45:15.420 align:start position:0%
you about House Bill 15
 
05:45:17.510 --> 05:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
um as you all know
 
05:45:19.490 --> 05:45:19.500 align:start position:0%
um we've been talking about this issue
 
05:45:21.770 --> 05:45:21.780 align:start position:0%
with you for a while
 
05:45:24.048 --> 05:45:24.058 align:start position:0%
um since the creation of room sharing
 
05:45:27.590 --> 05:45:27.600 align:start position:0%
and car sharing platforms really every
 
05:45:30.470 --> 05:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
state in the U.S has been dealing with
 
05:45:33.830 --> 05:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
the issue of the application of their
 
05:45:37.190 --> 05:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
rooms and meals or other taxes to these
 
05:45:40.850 --> 05:45:40.860 align:start position:0%
platform facilitated transactions and
 
05:45:44.208 --> 05:45:44.218 align:start position:0%
particularly which party the platform or
 
05:45:47.390 --> 05:45:47.400 align:start position:0%
the property owner is obligated and to
 
05:45:50.208 --> 05:45:50.218 align:start position:0%
collect obligated to collect and remit
 
05:45:52.490 --> 05:45:52.500 align:start position:0%
m r tax
 
05:45:54.288 --> 05:45:54.298 align:start position:0%
um to the state
 
05:45:57.170 --> 05:45:57.180 align:start position:0%
and additionally whether the tax applies
 
05:46:00.310 --> 05:46:00.320 align:start position:0%
to the entire price paid by the consumer
 
05:46:03.530 --> 05:46:03.540 align:start position:0%
as is currently stated in the New
 
05:46:06.708 --> 05:46:06.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire m r statute litigation over
 
05:46:08.930 --> 05:46:08.940 align:start position:0%
this issue has occurred in every single
 
05:46:11.270 --> 05:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
state and New Hampshire was one of the
 
05:46:13.368 --> 05:46:13.378 align:start position:0%
last states to receive a decision from
 
05:46:16.310 --> 05:46:16.320 align:start position:0%
our state supreme court in the Priceline
 
05:46:19.128 --> 05:46:19.138 align:start position:0%
case which was decided about three years
 
05:46:21.110 --> 05:46:21.120 align:start position:0%
ago where New Hampshire lost that case
 
05:46:23.150 --> 05:46:23.160 align:start position:0%
it was a really it was really an
 
05:46:27.170 --> 05:46:27.180 align:start position:0%
instance where the um the the pace of
 
05:46:29.810 --> 05:46:29.820 align:start position:0%
technology and
 
05:46:31.970 --> 05:46:31.980 align:start position:0%
um businesses changing how they operate
 
05:46:35.330 --> 05:46:35.340 align:start position:0%
wasn't kept up with by the statute
 
05:46:36.830 --> 05:46:36.840 align:start position:0%
um the proposed legislation would
 
05:46:39.170 --> 05:46:39.180 align:start position:0%
require room and car rental facilitators
 
05:46:42.288 --> 05:46:42.298 align:start position:0%
to collect and remit the m r tax for the
 
05:46:45.110 --> 05:46:45.120 align:start position:0%
transactions they facilitate and
 
05:46:47.208 --> 05:46:47.218 align:start position:0%
clarifies that the tax applies to the
 
05:46:49.730 --> 05:46:49.740 align:start position:0%
full price or consideration paid by the
 
05:46:49.740 --> 05:46:51.708 align:start position:0%
full price or consideration paid by the
consumer

05:46:51.708 --> 05:46:51.718 align:start position:0%
consumer
 
05:46:54.708 --> 05:46:54.718 align:start position:0%
um these transactions facilitate hated
 
05:46:57.590 --> 05:46:57.600 align:start position:0%
by these third-party platforms have
 
05:47:00.070 --> 05:47:00.080 align:start position:0%
always been taxable in New Hampshire
 
05:47:04.070 --> 05:47:04.080 align:start position:0%
this bill simply clarifies that it's the
 
05:47:07.548 --> 05:47:07.558 align:start position:0%
platform that's liable for collecting
 
05:47:09.708 --> 05:47:09.718 align:start position:0%
and remitting this tax I think this is
 
05:47:12.530 --> 05:47:12.540 align:start position:0%
important and uh speaker Packard talked
 
05:47:15.530 --> 05:47:15.540 align:start position:0%
about this in his testimony that these
 
05:47:19.250 --> 05:47:19.260 align:start position:0%
transactions have always been taxable
 
05:47:21.708 --> 05:47:21.718 align:start position:0%
um the question has just been is it the
 
05:47:24.288 --> 05:47:24.298 align:start position:0%
platform for the property owner that
 
05:47:27.590 --> 05:47:27.600 align:start position:0%
must collect and remit we think that the
 
05:47:29.150 --> 05:47:29.160 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation will improve
 
05:47:31.788 --> 05:47:31.798 align:start position:0%
compliance because the obligation of
 
05:47:34.490 --> 05:47:34.500 align:start position:0%
collecting and remitting will fall to
 
05:47:37.010 --> 05:47:37.020 align:start position:0%
the small number of platforms instead of
 
05:47:40.788 --> 05:47:40.798 align:start position:0%
the tens of thousands of property owners
 
05:47:42.288 --> 05:47:42.298 align:start position:0%
um in New Hampshire that are currently
 
05:47:44.750 --> 05:47:44.760 align:start position:0%
using these platforms and generally
 
05:47:46.910 --> 05:47:46.920 align:start position:0%
these platforms are the party that also
 
05:47:49.310 --> 05:47:49.320 align:start position:0%
receives the money including the tax
 
05:47:51.590 --> 05:47:51.600 align:start position:0%
from the consumer so it seems only
 
05:47:53.570 --> 05:47:53.580 align:start position:0%
appropriate that they should be the
 
05:47:57.288 --> 05:47:57.298 align:start position:0%
party um submitting the tax to the state
 
05:47:59.030 --> 05:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
um so we think that the proposed
 
05:48:00.890 --> 05:48:00.900 align:start position:0%
legislation could result in an increase
 
05:48:03.770 --> 05:48:03.780 align:start position:0%
in Revenue due to better compliance
 
05:48:07.070 --> 05:48:07.080 align:start position:0%
um and overall will serve to help us
 
05:48:08.570 --> 05:48:08.580 align:start position:0%
more efficiently and effectively
 
05:48:12.170 --> 05:48:12.180 align:start position:0%
administer the tax and to answer any
 
05:48:12.180 --> 05:48:13.548 align:start position:0%
administer the tax and to answer any
questions

05:48:13.548 --> 05:48:13.558 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:48:15.470 --> 05:48:15.480 align:start position:0%
you look forward
 
05:48:15.480 --> 05:48:17.620 align:start position:0%
you look forward
to me

05:48:17.620 --> 05:48:17.630 align:start position:0%
to me
 
05:48:17.630 --> 05:48:25.670 align:start position:0%
to me

on button on sorry Carolyn could you
 
05:48:34.788 --> 05:48:34.798 align:start position:0%
provide what uh the testimony you said

05:48:37.080 --> 05:48:39.650 align:start position:0%
in writing to the committee
absolutely

05:48:39.650 --> 05:48:39.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:41.208 --> 05:48:41.218 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:48:41.218 --> 05:48:44.868 align:start position:0%
thank you
questions

05:48:44.868 --> 05:48:44.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:46.970 --> 05:48:46.980 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I've got my hand up
 
05:48:46.980 --> 05:48:49.250 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I've got my hand up
representative

05:48:49.250 --> 05:48:49.260 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:48:52.910 --> 05:48:52.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman on we had a couple
 
05:48:57.770 --> 05:48:57.780 align:start position:0%
of assertions that I think uh are not in
 
05:49:00.830 --> 05:49:00.840 align:start position:0%
our law one of them was that if this
 
05:49:05.270 --> 05:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
passes the individual uh what turo calls
 
05:49:08.150 --> 05:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
hosts that on
 
05:49:11.288 --> 05:49:11.298 align:start position:0%
that provide their cars to be rented out
 
05:49:16.250 --> 05:49:16.260 align:start position:0%
on would have to set up as taxpayers
 
05:49:18.670 --> 05:49:18.680 align:start position:0%
under your system
 
05:49:21.830 --> 05:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
no I don't think that's true um I think
 
05:49:24.770 --> 05:49:24.780 align:start position:0%
the the goal of this legislation is I
 
05:49:28.330 --> 05:49:28.340 align:start position:0%
understand it is to actually prevent
 
05:49:31.310 --> 05:49:31.320 align:start position:0%
these off these car owners from having
 
05:49:35.810 --> 05:49:35.820 align:start position:0%
to individually become licensed instead
 
05:49:37.788 --> 05:49:37.798 align:start position:0%
um it imposes that obligation on the
 
05:49:41.270 --> 05:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
platform itself so instead of having
 
05:49:44.570 --> 05:49:44.580 align:start position:0%
um you know 10 000 operators licensed
 
05:49:46.730 --> 05:49:46.740 align:start position:0%
you just have one operator who's
 
05:49:49.548 --> 05:49:49.558 align:start position:0%
licensed and remitting the tax on behalf
 
05:49:52.128 --> 05:49:52.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:56.830 --> 05:49:56.840 align:start position:0%
thank you and if I could another on
 
05:50:01.128 --> 05:50:01.138 align:start position:0%
assertion was that the
 
05:50:01.138 --> 05:50:03.288 align:start position:0%
assertion was that the
on

05:50:03.288 --> 05:50:03.298 align:start position:0%
on
 
05:50:05.690 --> 05:50:05.700 align:start position:0%
oh dear which one was it
 
05:50:07.430 --> 05:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
I should have written all of these down
 
05:50:10.010 --> 05:50:10.020 align:start position:0%
in a separate place as we went along
 
05:50:13.670 --> 05:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
on all that on what they're being
 
05:50:17.390 --> 05:50:17.400 align:start position:0%
charged agency fees which a hotel Etc I
 
05:50:20.510 --> 05:50:20.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't pay on when we charge the rooms
 
05:50:22.970 --> 05:50:22.980 align:start position:0%
and meal Stacks do we separate out the
 
05:50:25.690 --> 05:50:25.700 align:start position:0%
their cost of advertising and
 
05:50:27.770 --> 05:50:27.780 align:start position:0%
and um
 
05:50:29.750 --> 05:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
booking and things
 
05:50:31.670 --> 05:50:31.680 align:start position:0%
representative only I think that's a
 
05:50:33.890 --> 05:50:33.900 align:start position:0%
really great question
 
05:50:38.030 --> 05:50:38.040 align:start position:0%
um so normally when you buy a a room
 
05:50:41.448 --> 05:50:41.458 align:start position:0%
from a hotel all of the hotels costs are
 
05:50:43.730 --> 05:50:43.740 align:start position:0%
sort of baked into that one price that
 
05:50:47.208 --> 05:50:47.218 align:start position:0%
you pay and the m r tax applies to that
 
05:50:50.628 --> 05:50:50.638 align:start position:0%
full price and certainly some portion of
 
05:50:52.788 --> 05:50:52.798 align:start position:0%
that is attributable to the advertising
 
05:50:54.948 --> 05:50:54.958 align:start position:0%
cost of that hotel
 
05:50:56.750 --> 05:50:56.760 align:start position:0%
um I think that's the logic behind
 
05:50:58.850 --> 05:50:58.860 align:start position:0%
including these service fees and the tax
 
05:51:02.208 --> 05:51:02.218 align:start position:0%
base for the m r tax the idea being that
 
05:51:05.930 --> 05:51:05.940 align:start position:0%
separating out charges isn't um a way to
 
05:51:08.810 --> 05:51:08.820 align:start position:0%
sort of shave away the underlying tax
 
05:51:08.820 --> 05:51:10.730 align:start position:0%
sort of shave away the underlying tax
base

05:51:10.730 --> 05:51:10.740 align:start position:0%
base
 
05:51:13.150 --> 05:51:13.160 align:start position:0%
thank you but could you also say whether
 
05:51:16.970 --> 05:51:16.980 align:start position:0%
on if you're renting a room at the Mount
 
05:51:18.948 --> 05:51:18.958 align:start position:0%
Washington and they include three days
 
05:51:21.590 --> 05:51:21.600 align:start position:0%
of skiing we charge a tax on the three
 
05:51:22.970 --> 05:51:22.980 align:start position:0%
days of skiing
 
05:51:25.250 --> 05:51:25.260 align:start position:0%
also a great question the answer to that
 
05:51:27.410 --> 05:51:27.420 align:start position:0%
would be no
 
05:51:31.910 --> 05:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
um the statute and rules provide that um
 
05:51:34.610 --> 05:51:34.620 align:start position:0%
really all that's taxable are charges
 
05:51:38.150 --> 05:51:38.160 align:start position:0%
that are commonly associated with a room
 
05:51:40.090 --> 05:51:40.100 align:start position:0%
or a car rental
 
05:51:43.430 --> 05:51:43.440 align:start position:0%
so for example if your your room rental
 
05:51:46.430 --> 05:51:46.440 align:start position:0%
has a separate cleaning fee that would
 
05:51:48.110 --> 05:51:48.120 align:start position:0%
be something that would be commonly
 
05:51:50.868 --> 05:51:50.878 align:start position:0%
associated with a room rental and the
 
05:51:53.390 --> 05:51:53.400 align:start position:0%
tax would be applied to it but if you
 
05:51:55.490 --> 05:51:55.500 align:start position:0%
for example make long distance phone
 
05:51:57.470 --> 05:51:57.480 align:start position:0%
calls from your room
 
05:51:59.690 --> 05:51:59.700 align:start position:0%
and there's a separately stated charge
 
05:52:01.788 --> 05:52:01.798 align:start position:0%
for those long-distance phone calls the
 
05:52:03.890 --> 05:52:03.900 align:start position:0%
m r tax wouldn't apply to that because
 
05:52:06.170 --> 05:52:06.180 align:start position:0%
that's not commonly associated with a
 
05:52:08.810 --> 05:52:08.820 align:start position:0%
hotel stay
 
05:52:11.448 --> 05:52:11.458 align:start position:0%
thank you can you put those answers also
 
05:52:14.750 --> 05:52:14.760 align:start position:0%
in what you send us all right thank you
 
05:52:14.760 --> 05:52:19.788 align:start position:0%
in what you send us all right thank you
representative

05:52:19.788 --> 05:52:19.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:19.798 --> 05:52:22.010 align:start position:0%
 
again

05:52:22.010 --> 05:52:22.020 align:start position:0%
again
 
05:52:24.410 --> 05:52:24.420 align:start position:0%
um yes thank you Mr chairman
 
05:52:24.420 --> 05:52:25.250 align:start position:0%
um yes thank you Mr chairman
um

05:52:25.250 --> 05:52:25.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:52:29.208 --> 05:52:29.218 align:start position:0%
my question would be that the discussion
 
05:52:31.250 --> 05:52:31.260 align:start position:0%
that was about whether individuals would
 
05:52:35.170 --> 05:52:35.180 align:start position:0%
potentially pay or the sharing app
 
05:52:37.670 --> 05:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
individuals my understanding of the
 
05:52:39.948 --> 05:52:39.958 align:start position:0%
business of the proprietorship let's say
 
05:52:43.070 --> 05:52:43.080 align:start position:0%
proprietorship business profits tax
 
05:52:45.470 --> 05:52:45.480 align:start position:0%
um you would isn't the threshold fifty
 
05:52:47.390 --> 05:52:47.400 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars so that if an
 
05:52:49.610 --> 05:52:49.620 align:start position:0%
individual is making about 300 a week as
 
05:52:51.048 --> 05:52:51.058 align:start position:0%
was suggested
 
05:52:53.448 --> 05:52:53.458 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't even get anywhere near the
 
05:52:55.610 --> 05:52:55.620 align:start position:0%
threshold for for
 
05:52:59.090 --> 05:52:59.100 align:start position:0%
um filing a BPT proprietorship BPT and
 
05:53:01.610 --> 05:53:01.620 align:start position:0%
therefore there'd be no tax on the
 
05:53:04.430 --> 05:53:04.440 align:start position:0%
individual is that correct
 
05:53:06.948 --> 05:53:06.958 align:start position:0%
that's correct for business profits tax
 
05:53:09.110 --> 05:53:09.120 align:start position:0%
purposes so you're right you know
 
05:53:10.610 --> 05:53:10.620 align:start position:0%
someone who's renting their car
 
05:53:13.010 --> 05:53:13.020 align:start position:0%
occasionally is never going to trip the
 
05:53:15.110 --> 05:53:15.120 align:start position:0%
threshold for becoming a business tax
 
05:53:15.120 --> 05:53:17.030 align:start position:0%
threshold for becoming a business tax
taxpayer

05:53:17.030 --> 05:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
taxpayer
 
05:53:19.310 --> 05:53:19.320 align:start position:0%
um however there is no threshold for the
 
05:53:22.490 --> 05:53:22.500 align:start position:0%
m r tax so there's no sort of de minimis
 
05:53:24.410 --> 05:53:24.420 align:start position:0%
threshold where if you engage in
 
05:53:26.690 --> 05:53:26.700 align:start position:0%
transactions under a certain amount your
 
05:53:29.390 --> 05:53:29.400 align:start position:0%
transactions aren't subject to tax
 
05:53:33.110 --> 05:53:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:36.230 --> 05:53:36.240 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
05:53:36.240 --> 05:53:45.070 align:start position:0%
any further questions

05:53:48.890 --> 05:53:48.900 align:start position:0%
yeah on the
 
05:53:51.948 --> 05:53:51.958 align:start position:0%

that happens sometimes
 
05:54:45.530 --> 05:54:45.540 align:start position:0%
you know Mr chairman when you gave up
 
05:54:52.360 --> 05:54:52.370 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:52.370 --> 05:54:57.590 align:start position:0%

representative Brown thank you Mr chair
 
05:55:25.368 --> 05:55:25.378 align:start position:0%
um we're leaving the best for last I
 
05:55:27.230 --> 05:55:27.240 align:start position:0%
would say and the most complicated for
 
05:55:27.240 --> 05:55:28.310 align:start position:0%
would say and the most complicated for
Less

05:55:28.310 --> 05:55:28.320 align:start position:0%
Less
 
05:55:30.470 --> 05:55:30.480 align:start position:0%
I'm the only speaker on this other than

the dra so just bear with me here uh I
 
05:55:35.628 --> 05:55:35.638 align:start position:0%
want to try to use this at the moment
 
05:55:37.930 --> 05:55:37.940 align:start position:0%
for the new members to try to understand
 
05:55:39.948 --> 05:55:39.958 align:start position:0%
market-based sourcing and single sales
 
05:55:41.810 --> 05:55:41.820 align:start position:0%
Factor if you can
 
05:55:43.610 --> 05:55:43.620 align:start position:0%
and then we'll have more discussions and
 
05:55:45.530 --> 05:55:45.540 align:start position:0%
what sessions on this
 
05:55:48.830 --> 05:55:48.840 align:start position:0%
uh but I'm here to introduce first off
 
05:55:50.810 --> 05:55:50.820 align:start position:0%

shoot yourself go 281 represent
 
05:55:58.730 --> 05:55:58.740 align:start position:0%
representative Ames is to co-sponsor
 
05:56:00.110 --> 05:56:00.120 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
05:56:02.990 --> 05:56:03.000 align:start position:0%
uh this is a very much a bipartisan bill
 
05:56:05.690 --> 05:56:05.700 align:start position:0%
from our work from last year another one
 
05:56:07.250 --> 05:56:07.260 align:start position:0%
of those bills that we've worked on as a
 
05:56:07.260 --> 05:56:08.208 align:start position:0%
of those bills that we've worked on as a
group

05:56:08.208 --> 05:56:08.218 align:start position:0%
group
 
05:56:11.030 --> 05:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
and came to our conclusions
 
05:56:13.510 --> 05:56:13.520 align:start position:0%
if anything this is a
 
05:56:17.150 --> 05:56:17.160 align:start position:0%
philosophical bills house versus Senate
 
05:56:19.490 --> 05:56:19.500 align:start position:0%
a senator has a different position on
 
05:56:22.670 --> 05:56:22.680 align:start position:0%
this bill and we have one on this bill
 
05:56:25.970 --> 05:56:25.980 align:start position:0%
uh the bill does four things it amends
 
05:56:29.208 --> 05:56:29.218 align:start position:0%
the tax expenditure uh thank you
 
05:56:31.850 --> 05:56:31.860 align:start position:0%
men's Which tax expenditures must be
 
05:56:34.190 --> 05:56:34.200 align:start position:0%
reported upon each year within the tax
 
05:56:36.230 --> 05:56:36.240 align:start position:0%
percentage report and I'll explain that
 
05:56:37.430 --> 05:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
in a minute
 
05:56:39.410 --> 05:56:39.420 align:start position:0%
delays the implementation of single
 
05:56:42.048 --> 05:56:42.058 align:start position:0%
satisfactor under the BPT from taxable
 
05:56:45.010 --> 05:56:45.020 align:start position:0%
periods ending on or after December 31st
 
05:56:49.070 --> 05:56:49.080 align:start position:0%
2022 which is next year's so it's not in
 
05:56:50.690 --> 05:56:50.700 align:start position:0%
effect right now it'll be in effect next
 
05:56:50.700 --> 05:56:51.650 align:start position:0%
effect right now it'll be in effect next
year

05:56:51.650 --> 05:56:51.660 align:start position:0%
year
 
05:56:54.048 --> 05:56:54.058 align:start position:0%
uh to periods ending on or after
 
05:56:57.288 --> 05:56:57.298 align:start position:0%
December 31st 2026.
 
05:56:59.990 --> 05:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
you know after I the more I review this
 
05:57:02.150 --> 05:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
bill uh that that may be a little bit
 
05:57:04.610 --> 05:57:04.620 align:start position:0%
far out and something we want to talk
 
05:57:07.368 --> 05:57:07.378 align:start position:0%
about as we proceed here
 
05:57:09.110 --> 05:57:09.120 align:start position:0%
the third thing is for that period
 
05:57:12.350 --> 05:57:12.360 align:start position:0%
meaning that the period between 22 and
 
05:57:15.230 --> 05:57:15.240 align:start position:0%
26 reverts back to the bill also
 
05:57:16.730 --> 05:57:16.740 align:start position:0%
reverses back to the enforcement
 
05:57:20.690 --> 05:57:20.700 align:start position:0%
methodology being used for tax tax uh
 
05:57:25.548 --> 05:57:25.558 align:start position:0%
periods that uh ended on or after on uh
 
05:57:29.628 --> 05:57:29.638 align:start position:0%
December 31st 2021 which is really this
 
05:57:32.390 --> 05:57:32.400 align:start position:0%
year's current methodology which for the
 
05:57:35.628 --> 05:57:35.638 align:start position:0%
first time includes market-based sources
 
05:57:38.030 --> 05:57:38.040 align:start position:0%
it's all important to know that this is
 
05:57:40.250 --> 05:57:40.260 align:start position:0%
the first time this year that we we're
 
05:57:41.868 --> 05:57:41.878 align:start position:0%
including market-based sourcing I'm
 
05:57:42.948 --> 05:57:42.958 align:start position:0%
going to explain what market-based
 
05:57:44.690 --> 05:57:44.700 align:start position:0%
sources in a minute
 
05:57:47.628 --> 05:57:47.638 align:start position:0%
and the final thing it does is it amends
 
05:57:49.610 --> 05:57:49.620 align:start position:0%
the duties of a legislative Commission
 
05:57:51.530 --> 05:57:51.540 align:start position:0%
on apportionment
 
05:57:54.770 --> 05:57:54.780 align:start position:0%
so let's pause a minute and talk about
 
05:57:54.780 --> 05:57:56.570 align:start position:0%
so let's pause a minute and talk about
apportionment

05:57:56.570 --> 05:57:56.580 align:start position:0%
apportionment
 
05:57:59.448 --> 05:57:59.458 align:start position:0%
uh what is apportionment and why is it
 
05:57:59.458 --> 05:58:00.830 align:start position:0%
uh what is apportionment and why is it
needed

05:58:00.830 --> 05:58:00.840 align:start position:0%
needed
 
05:58:02.930 --> 05:58:02.940 align:start position:0%
so if you you hold on the business in
 
05:58:04.190 --> 05:58:04.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
05:58:06.288 --> 05:58:06.298 align:start position:0%
and you only did business in New
 
05:58:07.910 --> 05:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you only had brick and mortar
 
05:58:09.350 --> 05:58:09.360 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire you had employees
 
05:58:11.570 --> 05:58:11.580 align:start position:0%
employed here and you're only sold in
 
05:58:12.890 --> 05:58:12.900 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
05:58:14.690 --> 05:58:14.700 align:start position:0%
your product
 
05:58:15.650 --> 05:58:15.660 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't have to worry about
 
05:58:15.660 --> 05:58:16.850 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't have to worry about
apportionment

05:58:16.850 --> 05:58:16.860 align:start position:0%
apportionment
 
05:58:19.850 --> 05:58:19.860 align:start position:0%
because you'd be 100 of of your profits
 
05:58:23.868 --> 05:58:23.878 align:start position:0%
would be taxed under New Hampshire law
 
05:58:25.128 --> 05:58:25.138 align:start position:0%
but that's
 
05:58:28.430 --> 05:58:28.440 align:start position:0%
not what most businesses even smaller
 
05:58:30.890 --> 05:58:30.900 align:start position:0%
businesses do have a reach into even the
 
05:58:32.448 --> 05:58:32.458 align:start position:0%
surrounding states like Maine and
 
05:58:34.128 --> 05:58:34.138 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Vermont
 
05:58:34.138 --> 05:58:35.590 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Vermont
so

05:58:35.590 --> 05:58:35.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:58:38.410 --> 05:58:38.420 align:start position:0%
bigger companies have
 
05:58:40.430 --> 05:58:40.440 align:start position:0%
reach across the country and
 
05:58:42.110 --> 05:58:42.120 align:start position:0%
internationally as well
 
05:58:45.230 --> 05:58:45.240 align:start position:0%
so there needs to be a way of
 
05:58:47.770 --> 05:58:47.780 align:start position:0%
apportioning the profits of a business
 
05:58:51.410 --> 05:58:51.420 align:start position:0%
across all the states that they in one
 
05:58:53.990 --> 05:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
way or another do some business in or
 
05:58:56.390 --> 05:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
have a presidency
 
05:58:58.730 --> 05:58:58.740 align:start position:0%
so that's what a portionment is
 
05:58:59.990 --> 05:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
so let's talk about the history
 
05:59:00.000 --> 05:59:01.368 align:start position:0%
so let's talk about the history
apportionment

05:59:01.368 --> 05:59:01.378 align:start position:0%
apportionment
 
05:59:05.030 --> 05:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
years and years ago uh
 
05:59:08.030 --> 05:59:08.040 align:start position:0%
it was very simple Most states all use
 
05:59:09.650 --> 05:59:09.660 align:start position:0%
the same methodology
 
05:59:12.708 --> 05:59:12.718 align:start position:0%
they use the one one the formula was
 
05:59:15.368 --> 05:59:15.378 align:start position:0%
based on one-third where your sales were
 
05:59:18.350 --> 05:59:18.360 align:start position:0%
one one-third on your tangible property
 
05:59:22.190 --> 05:59:22.200 align:start position:0%
Awards I want their way your payroll was
 
05:59:24.770 --> 05:59:24.780 align:start position:0%
and basically each each they use the
 
05:59:26.208 --> 05:59:26.218 align:start position:0%
same methodology so it was pretty fair
 
05:59:30.470 --> 05:59:30.480 align:start position:0%
and consistent approach to uh fortunate
 
05:59:34.128 --> 05:59:34.138 align:start position:0%
now with time though many states started
 
05:59:35.330 --> 05:59:35.340 align:start position:0%
to gain this
 
05:59:37.730 --> 05:59:37.740 align:start position:0%
and they decided that
 
05:59:39.770 --> 05:59:39.780 align:start position:0%
how can we maximize the revenue coming
 
05:59:41.448 --> 05:59:41.458 align:start position:0%
to our state
 
05:59:44.150 --> 05:59:44.160 align:start position:0%
and uh for those of you and I remember
 
05:59:46.250 --> 05:59:46.260 align:start position:0%
when I was first heard about this I said
 
05:59:47.930 --> 05:59:47.940 align:start position:0%
well why why isn't there a uniform
 
05:59:50.390 --> 05:59:50.400 align:start position:0%
approach across all states
 
05:59:52.430 --> 05:59:52.440 align:start position:0%
the federal government has stayed away
 
05:59:53.990 --> 05:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
from this question the only way that
 
05:59:56.628 --> 05:59:56.638 align:start position:0%
would happen is if they decided to have
 
05:59:58.548 --> 05:59:58.558 align:start position:0%
a law that says that the states will
 
06:00:01.150 --> 06:00:01.160 align:start position:0%
have the same uh formulas
 
06:00:03.410 --> 06:00:03.420 align:start position:0%
but there's no directive from the
 
06:00:04.730 --> 06:00:04.740 align:start position:0%
federal government on this just in case
 
06:00:06.048 --> 06:00:06.058 align:start position:0%
you're curious
 
06:00:07.850 --> 06:00:07.860 align:start position:0%
even New Hampshire
 
06:00:11.510 --> 06:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
a while back took the step of changing
 
06:00:13.850 --> 06:00:13.860 align:start position:0%
that one-third one-third one-third by
 
06:00:16.128 --> 06:00:16.138 align:start position:0%
doubling up on the sales portion of it
 
06:00:19.788 --> 06:00:19.798 align:start position:0%
so not this uh
 
06:00:19.798 --> 06:00:21.288 align:start position:0%
so not this uh
currently

06:00:21.288 --> 06:00:21.298 align:start position:0%
currently
 
06:00:23.868 --> 06:00:23.878 align:start position:0%
including tax period this year are
 
06:00:26.150 --> 06:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
apportionated one half on sales one
 
06:00:27.890 --> 06:00:27.900 align:start position:0%
quarter untangible property and one
 
06:00:30.530 --> 06:00:30.540 align:start position:0%
quarter on payroll
 
06:00:32.150 --> 06:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
so let me let me pause here and just
 
06:00:34.430 --> 06:00:34.440 align:start position:0%
touch on the the first uh point of the
 
06:00:37.490 --> 06:00:37.500 align:start position:0%
bill or which is the expenditure report
 
06:00:38.930 --> 06:00:38.940 align:start position:0%
and then we're going to go back to the
 
06:00:40.970 --> 06:00:40.980 align:start position:0%
history here
 
06:00:43.250 --> 06:00:43.260 align:start position:0%
so this this thing called a tax
 
06:00:45.530 --> 06:00:45.540 align:start position:0%
expenditure report that the dra puts out
 
06:00:47.090 --> 06:00:47.100 align:start position:0%
every year
 
06:00:49.730 --> 06:00:49.740 align:start position:0%
and meet in Ways and Means take a look
 
06:00:52.670 --> 06:00:52.680 align:start position:0%
at that several years ago
 
06:00:56.090 --> 06:00:56.100 align:start position:0%
uh they presented an is uh I asked the
 
06:00:57.708 --> 06:00:57.718 align:start position:0%
question because if you go to if you go
 
06:00:58.850 --> 06:00:58.860 align:start position:0%
to the bill
 
06:01:02.690 --> 06:01:02.700 align:start position:0%
uh that section is on uh page one line
 
06:01:04.910 --> 06:01:04.920 align:start position:0%
three to ten
 
06:01:08.330 --> 06:01:08.340 align:start position:0%
it basically is the language of of the
 
06:01:10.310 --> 06:01:10.320 align:start position:0%
what's required of the expenditure
 
06:01:10.320 --> 06:01:11.150 align:start position:0%
what's required of the expenditure
report

06:01:11.150 --> 06:01:11.160 align:start position:0%
report
 
06:01:13.190 --> 06:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
and you can see we took out
 
06:01:14.990 --> 06:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
uh we crossed out the weighted
 
06:01:18.890 --> 06:01:18.900 align:start position:0%
apportionment factors under RSA 77.
 
06:01:22.128 --> 06:01:22.138 align:start position:0%
that was put in years ago to monitor
 
06:01:23.810 --> 06:01:23.820 align:start position:0%
what we want to double sale double sales
 
06:01:25.490 --> 06:01:25.500 align:start position:0%
double sales
 
06:01:29.150 --> 06:01:29.160 align:start position:0%
and it got to a point where no one was
 
06:01:30.708 --> 06:01:30.718 align:start position:0%
really looking down at me we wanted to
 
06:01:34.190 --> 06:01:34.200 align:start position:0%
monitor the progress of that and it was
 
06:01:35.570 --> 06:01:35.580 align:start position:0%
the sidere said we really don't need
 
06:01:37.910 --> 06:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
that anymore I was the final I was going
 
06:01:40.548 --> 06:01:40.558 align:start position:0%
to file the bill simple Bill the
 
06:01:42.288 --> 06:01:42.298 align:start position:0%
original bill was just to get rid of
 
06:01:44.810 --> 06:01:44.820 align:start position:0%
that Salesforce that that piece in the
 
06:01:48.170 --> 06:01:48.180 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:51.410 --> 06:01:51.420 align:start position:0%
now it'll become clear that that bill
 
06:01:53.448 --> 06:01:53.458 align:start position:0%
became the vehicle that bill became the
 
06:01:56.510 --> 06:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
vehicle for other things As Time marched
 
06:01:58.548 --> 06:01:58.558 align:start position:0%
on here so
 
06:02:01.310 --> 06:02:01.320 align:start position:0%
so let me continue
 
06:02:03.650 --> 06:02:03.660 align:start position:0%
now I'm trying to piece this all
 
06:02:06.410 --> 06:02:06.420 align:start position:0%
together about three or four years ago
 
06:02:08.750 --> 06:02:08.760 align:start position:0%
we received the Senate bill
 
06:02:11.628 --> 06:02:11.638 align:start position:0%
uh that was filed by uh
 
06:02:13.548 --> 06:02:13.558 align:start position:0%
Senator Birdsall
 
06:02:15.948 --> 06:02:15.958 align:start position:0%
uh something about forming a commission
 
06:02:19.070 --> 06:02:19.080 align:start position:0%
to study market-based source
 
06:02:21.890 --> 06:02:21.900 align:start position:0%
and the reason she filed it is he had a
 
06:02:23.810 --> 06:02:23.820 align:start position:0%
constituent constituent we'll just call
 
06:02:25.070 --> 06:02:25.080 align:start position:0%
him out
 
06:02:26.948 --> 06:02:26.958 align:start position:0%
well Al had a business
 
06:02:31.070 --> 06:02:31.080 align:start position:0%
that brokered food across the country
 
06:02:33.530 --> 06:02:33.540 align:start position:0%
but all his business was based in New
 
06:02:33.540 --> 06:02:34.490 align:start position:0%
but all his business was based in New
Hampshire

06:02:34.490 --> 06:02:34.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
06:02:37.368 --> 06:02:37.378 align:start position:0%
and market-based sourcing has to do with
 
06:02:40.910 --> 06:02:40.920 align:start position:0%
Services how do you how do you apportion
 
06:02:44.448 --> 06:02:44.458 align:start position:0%
services like his where he's a broker
 
06:02:47.208 --> 06:02:47.218 align:start position:0%
but he broke his products to other
 
06:02:47.218 --> 06:02:48.230 align:start position:0%
but he broke his products to other
states

06:02:48.230 --> 06:02:48.240 align:start position:0%
states
 
06:02:50.930 --> 06:02:50.940 align:start position:0%
that let's use turkeys because that's
 
06:02:53.030 --> 06:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
that's easy to get food so he would he
 
06:02:55.010 --> 06:02:55.020 align:start position:0%
would buy turkeys in in the Carolinas
 
06:02:58.788 --> 06:02:58.798 align:start position:0%
and sell it to supermarkets in
 
06:03:01.190 --> 06:03:01.200 align:start position:0%
in uh in Maine
 
06:03:02.930 --> 06:03:02.940 align:start position:0%
the reason I'm using man is you have to
 
06:03:05.930 --> 06:03:05.940 align:start position:0%
you'll see why in a minute so
 
06:03:08.990 --> 06:03:09.000 align:start position:0%
so we
 
06:03:09.000 --> 06:03:12.770 align:start position:0%
so we
uh

06:03:12.770 --> 06:03:12.780 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:14.990 --> 06:03:15.000 align:start position:0%
so we had this we had this commission we
 
06:03:17.750 --> 06:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
had this commission that was made up of
 
06:03:19.970 --> 06:03:19.980 align:start position:0%
a variety of people I'll get to that in
 
06:03:22.128 --> 06:03:22.138 align:start position:0%
a minute but here's the difference
 
06:03:24.350 --> 06:03:24.360 align:start position:0%
between what we do
 
06:03:26.930 --> 06:03:26.940 align:start position:0%
we were doing and what we do now we did
 
06:03:29.270 --> 06:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
cost of performance and what cost the
 
06:03:31.910 --> 06:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
performance is is where the service is
 
06:03:34.548 --> 06:03:34.558 align:start position:0%
performed gets the tax benefit
 
06:03:37.910 --> 06:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
so New Hampshire it was where
 
06:03:40.128 --> 06:03:40.138 align:start position:0%
the people doing the brokering in this
 
06:03:41.810 --> 06:03:41.820 align:start position:0%
case or if you're a computer company
 
06:03:44.628 --> 06:03:44.638 align:start position:0%
we're doing from their offices in New
 
06:03:46.610 --> 06:03:46.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but providing service to
 
06:03:48.708 --> 06:03:48.718 align:start position:0%
another state or a company in another
 
06:03:48.718 --> 06:03:49.670 align:start position:0%
another state or a company in another
state

06:03:49.670 --> 06:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
state
 
06:03:52.730 --> 06:03:52.740 align:start position:0%
all of that tax was apportioned to New
 
06:03:52.740 --> 06:03:54.590 align:start position:0%
all of that tax was apportioned to New
Hampshire

06:03:54.590 --> 06:03:54.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
06:03:57.048 --> 06:03:57.058 align:start position:0%
what happened to Al
 
06:04:00.890 --> 06:04:00.900 align:start position:0%
uh several years ago is that Maine went
 
06:04:03.048 --> 06:04:03.058 align:start position:0%
to market-based sources
 
06:04:05.350 --> 06:04:05.360 align:start position:0%
so what's market-based on
 
06:04:09.708 --> 06:04:09.718 align:start position:0%
where the benefit is where market-based
 
06:04:11.990 --> 06:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
sourcing emphasizes where the benefit is
 
06:04:15.708 --> 06:04:15.718 align:start position:0%
received the person the the state that
 
06:04:17.990 --> 06:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
in which the company is that receives
 
06:04:20.930 --> 06:04:20.940 align:start position:0%
the benefit is is where the tax benefit
 
06:04:23.448 --> 06:04:23.458 align:start position:0%
goes so it's just the opposite
 
06:04:25.368 --> 06:04:25.378 align:start position:0%
so what happened was
 
06:04:28.070 --> 06:04:28.080 align:start position:0%
there there was Al minding his own
 
06:04:29.990 --> 06:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
business and he gets a tax notice from
 
06:04:30.000 --> 06:04:31.010 align:start position:0%
business and he gets a tax notice from
Maine

06:04:31.010 --> 06:04:31.020 align:start position:0%
Maine
 
06:04:34.190 --> 06:04:34.200 align:start position:0%
saying you always all this back taxes
 
06:04:34.200 --> 06:04:35.390 align:start position:0%
saying you always all this back taxes
because

06:04:35.390 --> 06:04:35.400 align:start position:0%
because
 
06:04:37.368 --> 06:04:37.378 align:start position:0%
you're doing business with this company
 
06:04:40.010 --> 06:04:40.020 align:start position:0%
name receiving your turkeys
 
06:04:42.830 --> 06:04:42.840 align:start position:0%
okay and you didn't pay taxes because we
 
06:04:46.490 --> 06:04:46.500 align:start position:0%
got market-based sourcing and and our
 
06:04:50.810 --> 06:04:50.820 align:start position:0%
law says that you you owe us money
 
06:04:54.288 --> 06:04:54.298 align:start position:0%
so uh so
 
06:04:56.810 --> 06:04:56.820 align:start position:0%
so there's a situation where
 
06:05:00.110 --> 06:05:00.120 align:start position:0%
both Al of Al you know New Hampshire
 
06:05:03.170 --> 06:05:03.180 align:start position:0%
collected a tax from him and Main
 
06:05:05.150 --> 06:05:05.160 align:start position:0%
Collective attacks he was double tasked
 
06:05:06.830 --> 06:05:06.840 align:start position:0%
for this
 
06:05:08.750 --> 06:05:08.760 align:start position:0%
so what happened was we did form this
 
06:05:08.760 --> 06:05:09.770 align:start position:0%
so what happened was we did form this
Commission

06:05:09.770 --> 06:05:09.780 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
06:05:11.930 --> 06:05:11.940 align:start position:0%
representative major and I were on it uh
 
06:05:13.730 --> 06:05:13.740 align:start position:0%
representative Lovejoy
 
06:05:17.090 --> 06:05:17.100 align:start position:0%
was on it represent around me would stop
 
06:05:18.890 --> 06:05:18.900 align:start position:0%
by and try to attend as many meetings we
 
06:05:20.230 --> 06:05:20.240 align:start position:0%
also had
 
06:05:22.910 --> 06:05:22.920 align:start position:0%
dalessandro and bertzok chaired
 
06:05:25.548 --> 06:05:25.558 align:start position:0%
uh we had commissioner step on it but we
 
06:05:28.070 --> 06:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
also had I what I would characterize as
 
06:05:31.250 --> 06:05:31.260 align:start position:0%
probably the two of the best uh one of
 
06:05:33.470 --> 06:05:33.480 align:start position:0%
the two of the best tax accountants and
 
06:05:36.048 --> 06:05:36.058 align:start position:0%
tax lawyers in the state on this
 
06:05:36.058 --> 06:05:37.430 align:start position:0%
tax lawyers in the state on this
Commission

06:05:37.430 --> 06:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
06:05:39.230 --> 06:05:39.240 align:start position:0%
uh to go through this we actually
 
06:05:41.270 --> 06:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
extended this commission to make it a
 
06:05:43.368 --> 06:05:43.378 align:start position:0%
year and a half uh we went through it
 
06:05:46.190 --> 06:05:46.200 align:start position:0%
all and we concluded at the very end
 
06:05:48.110 --> 06:05:48.120 align:start position:0%
that that market bait we should go to
 
06:05:49.610 --> 06:05:49.620 align:start position:0%
market-based sources
 
06:05:49.620 --> 06:05:51.048 align:start position:0%
market-based sources
so

06:05:51.048 --> 06:05:51.058 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:05:52.970 --> 06:05:52.980 align:start position:0%
market-based sourcing is now in effect
 
06:05:55.850 --> 06:05:55.860 align:start position:0%
this year okay this taxable year that
 
06:05:58.490 --> 06:05:58.500 align:start position:0%
ends in the periods ending December 31st
 
06:06:01.190 --> 06:06:01.200 align:start position:0%
of 2001 we forward our
 
06:06:03.590 --> 06:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
our we are now market-based Force
 
06:06:07.868 --> 06:06:07.878 align:start position:0%
sources so this year for the first time
 
06:06:11.270 --> 06:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
well be out from under being double taps
 
06:06:14.090 --> 06:06:14.100 align:start position:0%
that's all fine and good but what where
 
06:06:17.628 --> 06:06:17.638 align:start position:0%
a lot of our conversation was is
 
06:06:20.750 --> 06:06:20.760 align:start position:0%
for us to go to market-based sourcing
 
06:06:24.350 --> 06:06:24.360 align:start position:0%
the dra has to identify businesses
 
06:06:26.330 --> 06:06:26.340 align:start position:0%
unless you choose Maine to be simpler
 
06:06:28.368 --> 06:06:28.378 align:start position:0%
all over the country but let's say Maine
 
06:06:30.110 --> 06:06:30.120 align:start position:0%
you have to go and find all those
 
06:06:31.788 --> 06:06:31.798 align:start position:0%
companies in Maine
 
06:06:35.390 --> 06:06:35.400 align:start position:0%
that are providing services
 
06:06:36.948 --> 06:06:36.958 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire
 
06:06:39.170 --> 06:06:39.180 align:start position:0%
let's say a computer company
 
06:06:43.128 --> 06:06:43.138 align:start position:0%
okay that the software uh or just you
 
06:06:45.830 --> 06:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
know but they never set foot in New
 
06:06:47.690 --> 06:06:47.700 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but they're they're providing
 
06:06:50.208 --> 06:06:50.218 align:start position:0%
service to companies in New Hampshire we
 
06:06:52.250 --> 06:06:52.260 align:start position:0%
have to find all those those companies
 
06:06:53.330 --> 06:06:53.340 align:start position:0%
so that's
 
06:06:55.850 --> 06:06:55.860 align:start position:0%
that's important because this is part of
 
06:06:57.650 --> 06:06:57.660 align:start position:0%
our reasoning about wanting to swallow
 
06:07:02.030 --> 06:07:02.040 align:start position:0%
up a single sales Factor uh we'll get to
 
06:07:02.040 --> 06:07:02.868 align:start position:0%
up a single sales Factor uh we'll get to
that

06:07:02.868 --> 06:07:02.878 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:07:02.878 --> 06:07:04.070 align:start position:0%
that
so

06:07:04.070 --> 06:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:07:06.650 --> 06:07:06.660 align:start position:0%
uh but the other thing in that
 
06:07:06.660 --> 06:07:08.810 align:start position:0%
uh but the other thing in that
Commission

06:07:08.810 --> 06:07:08.820 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
06:07:11.030 --> 06:07:11.040 align:start position:0%
we did touch on briefly at the end on
 
06:07:14.030 --> 06:07:14.040 align:start position:0%
single sales Factor and there were two
 
06:07:17.270 --> 06:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
senators on this three three house
 
06:07:21.288 --> 06:07:21.298 align:start position:0%
members we we agreed not to touch single
 
06:07:24.110 --> 06:07:24.120 align:start position:0%
single sales factor for a while
 
06:07:27.770 --> 06:07:27.780 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:27.780 --> 06:07:29.690 align:start position:0%
 
so

06:07:29.690 --> 06:07:29.700 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:07:31.610 --> 06:07:31.620 align:start position:0%
what happened
 
06:07:31.620 --> 06:07:36.410 align:start position:0%
what happened
uh

06:07:36.410 --> 06:07:36.420 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:37.970 --> 06:07:37.980 align:start position:0%
all right that's what I lost my spot
 
06:07:37.980 --> 06:07:39.530 align:start position:0%
all right that's what I lost my spot
here

06:07:39.530 --> 06:07:39.540 align:start position:0%
here
 
06:07:42.170 --> 06:07:42.180 align:start position:0%
so where are we today
 
06:07:46.970 --> 06:07:46.980 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:50.750 --> 06:07:50.760 align:start position:0%
which was let's go back to 2019.
 
06:07:52.850 --> 06:07:52.860 align:start position:0%
the budget there was a budget the budget
 
06:07:54.770 --> 06:07:54.780 align:start position:0%
was veto
 
06:07:57.948 --> 06:07:57.958 align:start position:0%
uh last year who recall there were three
 
06:08:01.310 --> 06:08:01.320 align:start position:0%
months of of downtime
 
06:08:04.548 --> 06:08:04.558 align:start position:0%
then it was compromised
 
06:08:08.150 --> 06:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
and in the compromise
 
06:08:09.890 --> 06:08:09.900 align:start position:0%
you know one of the last things stuck in
 
06:08:12.470 --> 06:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
there by the Senate
 
06:08:15.890 --> 06:08:15.900 align:start position:0%
without hearings for us was single sales
 
06:08:18.110 --> 06:08:18.120 align:start position:0%
Factor okay
 
06:08:21.048 --> 06:08:21.058 align:start position:0%
now to appease us
 
06:08:22.850 --> 06:08:22.860 align:start position:0%
they put
 
06:08:25.610 --> 06:08:25.620 align:start position:0%
they created our commit a a joint
 
06:08:28.070 --> 06:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
committee three three house Men Four
 
06:08:30.230 --> 06:08:30.240 align:start position:0%
house members three senators
 
06:08:32.448 --> 06:08:32.458 align:start position:0%
and they were supposed to be
 
06:08:32.458 --> 06:08:33.830 align:start position:0%
and they were supposed to be
twice

06:08:33.830 --> 06:08:33.840 align:start position:0%
twice
 
06:08:37.430 --> 06:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
and then they were supposed to vote
 
06:08:39.470 --> 06:08:39.480 align:start position:0%
they were supposed to vote
 
06:08:42.830 --> 06:08:42.840 align:start position:0%
uh whether to rescind just a single SAS
 
06:08:42.840 --> 06:08:43.788 align:start position:0%
uh whether to rescind just a single SAS
back

06:08:43.788 --> 06:08:43.798 align:start position:0%
back
 
06:08:43.798 --> 06:08:46.070 align:start position:0%
back
okay

06:08:46.070 --> 06:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:08:49.010 --> 06:08:49.020 align:start position:0%
again then the virus hit it was they
 
06:08:50.930 --> 06:08:50.940 align:start position:0%
never met the first time
 
06:08:52.910 --> 06:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
and then when they tried and Robertson
 
06:08:54.410 --> 06:08:54.420 align:start position:0%
around me you can chime in later about
 
06:08:56.510 --> 06:08:56.520 align:start position:0%
this but my understanding is
 
06:08:59.990 --> 06:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
that uh this all blew up in a
 
06:09:00.000 --> 06:09:01.548 align:start position:0%
that uh this all blew up in a
technicality

06:09:01.548 --> 06:09:01.558 align:start position:0%
technicality
 
06:09:05.048 --> 06:09:05.058 align:start position:0%
that it was basically against our rules
 
06:09:09.230 --> 06:09:09.240 align:start position:0%
to have a committee Within
 
06:09:11.628 --> 06:09:11.638 align:start position:0%
something in the budget without going to
 
06:09:14.448 --> 06:09:14.458 align:start position:0%
the house for the center floor it was it
 
06:09:17.150 --> 06:09:17.160 align:start position:0%
wasn't allowed although it was in the
 
06:09:19.368 --> 06:09:19.378 align:start position:0%
world it was it was in what we all
 
06:09:22.670 --> 06:09:22.680 align:start position:0%
thought we were going to do so so what
 
06:09:24.170 --> 06:09:24.180 align:start position:0%
what happened was
 
06:09:24.180 --> 06:09:26.110 align:start position:0%
what happened was
uh

06:09:26.110 --> 06:09:26.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:09:30.170 --> 06:09:30.180 align:start position:0%
right now as we sit here single sales
 
06:09:31.970 --> 06:09:31.980 align:start position:0%
factor is coming
 
06:09:33.650 --> 06:09:33.660 align:start position:0%
in um
 
06:09:37.128 --> 06:09:37.138 align:start position:0%
for the taxable periods ending December
 
06:09:37.138 --> 06:09:38.208 align:start position:0%
for the taxable periods ending December
uh

06:09:38.208 --> 06:09:38.218 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:09:42.048 --> 06:09:42.058 align:start position:0%
uh beginning on or after December 31st
 
06:09:45.650 --> 06:09:45.660 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:48.350 --> 06:09:48.360 align:start position:0%
so with this legislative legislation
 
06:09:48.360 --> 06:09:50.570 align:start position:0%
so with this legislative legislation
does

06:09:50.570 --> 06:09:50.580 align:start position:0%
does
 
06:09:50.580 --> 06:09:51.850 align:start position:0%
does
is

06:09:51.850 --> 06:09:51.860 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:09:55.490 --> 06:09:55.500 align:start position:0%
we're basically reversing
 
06:09:59.390 --> 06:09:59.400 align:start position:0%
we're saying we want to delay that
 
06:10:06.830 --> 06:10:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:09.708 --> 06:10:09.718 align:start position:0%
the real thing here is that
 
06:10:12.650 --> 06:10:12.660 align:start position:0%
you wanted to lay it
 
06:10:15.110 --> 06:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
on market-based sourcing settle in that
 
06:10:16.788 --> 06:10:16.798 align:start position:0%
one here
 
06:10:18.890 --> 06:10:18.900 align:start position:0%
and then and then have a baseline of
 
06:10:21.590 --> 06:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
what happened to the business revenues
 
06:10:24.890 --> 06:10:24.900 align:start position:0%
and then give us time to
 
06:10:26.810 --> 06:10:26.820 align:start position:0%
get more and then we're also giving time
 
06:10:32.150 --> 06:10:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:34.310 --> 06:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
we get more information on it
 
06:10:36.890 --> 06:10:36.900 align:start position:0%
so we want to buy some time it isn't
 
06:10:39.010 --> 06:10:39.020 align:start position:0%
like we're against single sash Factory
 
06:10:41.570 --> 06:10:41.580 align:start position:0%
we just don't want to go on blindly the
 
06:10:43.610 --> 06:10:43.620 align:start position:0%
reason we don't I say we
 
06:10:46.730 --> 06:10:46.740 align:start position:0%
this is I'm speaking for the for the
 
06:10:48.890 --> 06:10:48.900 align:start position:0%
committee what is the means from last
 
06:10:51.048 --> 06:10:51.058 align:start position:0%
year after this one but
 
06:10:55.310 --> 06:10:55.320 align:start position:0%
last year we were concerned that if we
 
06:10:58.490 --> 06:10:58.500 align:start position:0%
make a mistake on this one it could be a
 
06:10:59.930 --> 06:10:59.940 align:start position:0%
major mistake
 
06:11:02.448 --> 06:11:02.458 align:start position:0%
you got to understand that what oh I
 
06:11:04.610 --> 06:11:04.620 align:start position:0%
didn't expect it
 
06:11:08.270 --> 06:11:08.280 align:start position:0%
single sales factor is do you take away
 
06:11:10.548 --> 06:11:10.558 align:start position:0%
where the people are you take away what
 
06:11:13.368 --> 06:11:13.378 align:start position:0%
the client is what you're left with your
 
06:11:16.190 --> 06:11:16.200 align:start position:0%
abortion simply on sales
 
06:11:19.250 --> 06:11:19.260 align:start position:0%
so if your sales are out of state
 
06:11:23.410 --> 06:11:23.420 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:28.730 --> 06:11:28.740 align:start position:0%
gets their credit for not not so if you
 
06:11:31.190 --> 06:11:31.200 align:start position:0%
look at our upside down triangle for
 
06:11:32.570 --> 06:11:32.580 align:start position:0%
business taxes
 
06:11:34.430 --> 06:11:34.440 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of large companies that
 
06:11:36.350 --> 06:11:36.360 align:start position:0%
work that represent most of our profit
 
06:11:36.360 --> 06:11:38.330 align:start position:0%
work that represent most of our profit
stocks

06:11:38.330 --> 06:11:38.340 align:start position:0%
stocks
 
06:11:41.690 --> 06:11:41.700 align:start position:0%
and what what we're concerned about is a
 
06:11:44.090 --> 06:11:44.100 align:start position:0%
lot of our manufacturers when you look
 
06:11:46.910 --> 06:11:46.920 align:start position:0%
at the biggest ones like uh bae
 
06:11:50.570 --> 06:11:50.580 align:start position:0%
uh their narrow streets you know
 
06:11:52.430 --> 06:11:52.440 align:start position:0%
they don't sell here
 
06:11:53.868 --> 06:11:53.878 align:start position:0%
they sell
 
06:11:57.170 --> 06:11:57.180 align:start position:0%
you know to all over the country
 
06:12:00.650 --> 06:12:00.660 align:start position:0%
so where we are concerned about what the
 
06:12:02.390 --> 06:12:02.400 align:start position:0%
impact is going to be
 
06:12:04.610 --> 06:12:04.620 align:start position:0%
other states because one thing to
 
06:12:06.350 --> 06:12:06.360 align:start position:0%
Grapple within the commission
 
06:12:08.750 --> 06:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
but data we want data I know looks at a
 
06:12:11.150 --> 06:12:11.160 align:start position:0%
major we want data to see what
 
06:12:12.948 --> 06:12:12.958 align:start position:0%
it's going to do to us unfortunately the
 
06:12:14.448 --> 06:12:14.458 align:start position:0%
data we really want is very hard to get
 
06:12:14.458 --> 06:12:15.350 align:start position:0%
data we really want is very hard to get
at

06:12:15.350 --> 06:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
at
 
06:12:15.360 --> 06:12:17.090 align:start position:0%
at
okay

06:12:17.090 --> 06:12:17.100 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:12:19.548 --> 06:12:19.558 align:start position:0%
um so so we wanted to because other
 
06:12:21.470 --> 06:12:21.480 align:start position:0%
states when we asked about how how did
 
06:12:22.548 --> 06:12:22.558 align:start position:0%
other states
 
06:12:25.368 --> 06:12:25.378 align:start position:0%
decide to jump in
 
06:12:28.850 --> 06:12:28.860 align:start position:0%
no data data decided to jump in
 
06:12:31.310 --> 06:12:31.320 align:start position:0%
so yeah but
 
06:12:33.890 --> 06:12:33.900 align:start position:0%
all those other states have an income
 
06:12:35.650 --> 06:12:35.660 align:start position:0%
tax and a sales tax
 
06:12:39.070 --> 06:12:39.080 align:start position:0%
this is our major tax business taxes
 
06:12:41.150 --> 06:12:41.160 align:start position:0%
last two weeks
 
06:12:43.128 --> 06:12:43.138 align:start position:0%
so we're just trying to build across
 
06:12:45.110 --> 06:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
this year we're gonna we're making an
 
06:12:45.120 --> 06:12:46.070 align:start position:0%
this year we're gonna we're making an
attempt

06:12:46.070 --> 06:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
attempt
 
06:12:48.650 --> 06:12:48.660 align:start position:0%
uh to to
 
06:12:50.990 --> 06:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
slow this down a bit so that we can
 
06:12:53.930 --> 06:12:53.940 align:start position:0%
actually evaluate the impact of this
 
06:12:55.548 --> 06:12:55.558 align:start position:0%
I don't think the play is going to be
 
06:12:57.350 --> 06:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
here in the house it's really going to
 
06:13:00.110 --> 06:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
be the kids or the Senate
 
06:13:01.490 --> 06:13:01.500 align:start position:0%
because the senators are going to have
 
06:13:03.948 --> 06:13:03.958 align:start position:0%
to agree with this is
 
06:13:03.958 --> 06:13:05.390 align:start position:0%
to agree with this is
now

06:13:05.390 --> 06:13:05.400 align:start position:0%
now
 
06:13:07.910 --> 06:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
I had a call a zoom meeting yesterday
 
06:13:07.920 --> 06:13:09.770 align:start position:0%
I had a call a zoom meeting yesterday
his

06:13:09.770 --> 06:13:09.780 align:start position:0%
his
 
06:13:12.350 --> 06:13:12.360 align:start position:0%
Bill harbinger
 
06:13:14.090 --> 06:13:14.100 align:start position:0%
one of the probably one of the top tax
 
06:13:17.390 --> 06:13:17.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:21.730 --> 06:13:21.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:24.230 --> 06:13:24.240 align:start position:0%
he was he was saying oh you got to
 
06:13:26.208 --> 06:13:26.218 align:start position:0%
really do this guy you've got to reel it
 
06:13:29.150 --> 06:13:29.160 align:start position:0%
says super satisfactory
 
06:13:31.670 --> 06:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
and I said I explained to him
 
06:13:32.930 --> 06:13:32.940 align:start position:0%
now we're in the house we're a little
 
06:13:36.170 --> 06:13:36.180 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:38.270 --> 06:13:38.280 align:start position:0%
um but what he said what was passed us
 
06:13:42.708 --> 06:13:42.718 align:start position:0%
on is that 30 states have done this now
 
06:13:45.530 --> 06:13:45.540 align:start position:0%
so is it just a matter of time before
 
06:13:48.470 --> 06:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire does it probably yes
 
06:13:52.490 --> 06:13:52.500 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:53.750 --> 06:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
I'm not quite sure if we're surround
 
06:13:55.910 --> 06:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
advisable sales Factor we'll find that
 
06:13:58.730 --> 06:13:58.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:00.890 --> 06:14:00.900 align:start position:0%
so again this is our attempt to slow it
 
06:14:02.270 --> 06:14:02.280 align:start position:0%
down a bit
 
06:14:04.610 --> 06:14:04.620 align:start position:0%
of the spell the other thing the bill
 
06:14:07.730 --> 06:14:07.740 align:start position:0%
does is it that that committee that
 
06:14:11.448 --> 06:14:11.458 align:start position:0%
joined committee we've reactivated it
 
06:14:13.730 --> 06:14:13.740 align:start position:0%
and he said let us it'll be a committee
 
06:14:16.250 --> 06:14:16.260 align:start position:0%
that monitors
 
06:14:19.128 --> 06:14:19.138 align:start position:0%
partners of market-based sourcing and
 
06:14:20.510 --> 06:14:20.520 align:start position:0%
going forward
 
06:14:20.520 --> 06:14:22.190 align:start position:0%
going forward
so

06:14:22.190 --> 06:14:22.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:14:25.490 --> 06:14:25.500 align:start position:0%
that's the big picture of what's going
 
06:14:25.500 --> 06:14:27.650 align:start position:0%
that's the big picture of what's going
on

06:14:27.650 --> 06:14:27.660 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:33.548 --> 06:14:33.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:36.530 --> 06:14:36.540 align:start position:0%
representative major I like data
 
06:14:40.090 --> 06:14:40.100 align:start position:0%
just like I like data questions
 
06:14:43.368 --> 06:14:43.378 align:start position:0%
thank you my hand is up and you had also
 
06:14:45.530 --> 06:14:45.540 align:start position:0%
said that maybe I should say something
 
06:14:48.530 --> 06:14:48.540 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:50.628 --> 06:14:50.638 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
06:14:50.638 --> 06:14:52.128 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
on

06:14:52.128 --> 06:14:52.138 align:start position:0%
on
 
06:14:54.770 --> 06:14:54.780 align:start position:0%
first of all this is just historical at
 
06:14:57.470 --> 06:14:57.480 align:start position:0%
this point but on that special committee
 
06:15:00.230 --> 06:15:00.240 align:start position:0%
I was told during we were told during
 
06:15:03.530 --> 06:15:03.540 align:start position:0%
the budget and negotiations that uh it
 
06:15:05.810 --> 06:15:05.820 align:start position:0%
was constitutional for that special
 
06:15:09.948 --> 06:15:09.958 align:start position:0%
committee to remove the part of the
 
06:15:12.110 --> 06:15:12.120 align:start position:0%
budget that was about single sales
 
06:15:15.470 --> 06:15:15.480 align:start position:0%
Factor on six months later the same
 
06:15:18.470 --> 06:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
person told us that it was not
 
06:15:21.530 --> 06:15:21.540 align:start position:0%
constitutional and we couldn't do it or
 
06:15:24.110 --> 06:15:24.120 align:start position:0%
three months later whatever it was no it
 
06:15:26.990 --> 06:15:27.000 align:start position:0%
was a year uh so
 
06:15:30.830 --> 06:15:30.840 align:start position:0%
so anyway we are what we're trying to do
 
06:15:34.310 --> 06:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
is what we really wanted to do back when
 
06:15:36.230 --> 06:15:36.240 align:start position:0%
we did the special committee which was
 
06:15:39.948 --> 06:15:39.958 align:start position:0%
to to delay it so that we can have the
 
06:15:42.650 --> 06:15:42.660 align:start position:0%
time to know how much money we're going
 
06:15:45.708 --> 06:15:45.718 align:start position:0%
to lose it seems highly likely where
 
06:15:48.610 --> 06:15:48.620 align:start position:0%
you're going to lose Revenue over this
 
06:15:52.010 --> 06:15:52.020 align:start position:0%
because we are an elderly State we
 
06:15:55.250 --> 06:15:55.260 align:start position:0%
consume less than other states and we
 
06:15:56.990 --> 06:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
have a very large number of
 
06:16:00.410 --> 06:16:00.420 align:start position:0%
Manufacturers for our size and they
 
06:16:03.048 --> 06:16:03.058 align:start position:0%
almost all sell most almost entirely
 
06:16:05.330 --> 06:16:05.340 align:start position:0%
outside the state so they would not be
 
06:16:08.330 --> 06:16:08.340 align:start position:0%
paying business profits tax
 
06:16:11.510 --> 06:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
uh if this happens they'd only be paying
 
06:16:11.520 --> 06:16:13.010 align:start position:0%
uh if this happens they'd only be paying
bet

06:16:13.010 --> 06:16:13.020 align:start position:0%
bet
 
06:16:15.350 --> 06:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
and um
 
06:16:15.360 --> 06:16:17.390 align:start position:0%
and um
but

06:16:17.390 --> 06:16:17.400 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:16:17.400 --> 06:16:19.070 align:start position:0%
but
on

06:16:19.070 --> 06:16:19.080 align:start position:0%
on
 
06:16:22.970 --> 06:16:22.980 align:start position:0%
that we we need the bill both to find
 
06:16:26.330 --> 06:16:26.340 align:start position:0%
out how much we would lose because all
 
06:16:29.150 --> 06:16:29.160 align:start position:0%
those other states have changed over
 
06:16:31.970 --> 06:16:31.980 align:start position:0%
we're we're going to have major double
 
06:16:34.010 --> 06:16:34.020 align:start position:0%
taxation issues we're going to have to
 
06:16:37.070 --> 06:16:37.080 align:start position:0%
do something at some point but to find
 
06:16:39.650 --> 06:16:39.660 align:start position:0%
out what's going on and the reason it
 
06:16:44.990 --> 06:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
goes to 2026 is that on the dra in
 
06:16:48.048 --> 06:16:48.058 align:start position:0%
orientation told us that they had just
 
06:16:51.708 --> 06:16:51.718 align:start position:0%
they were just finishing bringing out a
 
06:16:55.368 --> 06:16:55.378 align:start position:0%
new online tax system they also have a
 
06:16:58.850 --> 06:16:58.860 align:start position:0%
tax uh analysis system that is in place
 
06:17:02.628 --> 06:17:02.638 align:start position:0%
now we had very bad data 10 years ago
 
06:17:05.868 --> 06:17:05.878 align:start position:0%
even a huge very bad data 10 years ago
 
06:17:05.878 --> 06:17:07.670 align:start position:0%
even a huge very bad data 10 years ago
and

06:17:07.670 --> 06:17:07.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:17:11.448 --> 06:17:11.458 align:start position:0%
um this will bring us up to par with
 
06:17:17.570 --> 06:17:17.580 align:start position:0%
most other states at least on and but it
 
06:17:19.430 --> 06:17:19.440 align:start position:0%
is only going online for the business
 
06:17:22.150 --> 06:17:22.160 align:start position:0%
taxes this year we are starting
 
06:17:24.948 --> 06:17:24.958 align:start position:0%
market-based sourcing this year so we
 
06:17:27.650 --> 06:17:27.660 align:start position:0%
don't know what market-based sourcing is
 
06:17:31.788 --> 06:17:31.798 align:start position:0%
going to do to these revenues on and we
 
06:17:34.430 --> 06:17:34.440 align:start position:0%
can't distinguish the businesses that
 
06:17:36.410 --> 06:17:36.420 align:start position:0%
are selling until this year we can't
 
06:17:38.750 --> 06:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
distinguish the businesses that are
 
06:17:40.670 --> 06:17:40.680 align:start position:0%
selling mostly out of state from the
 
06:17:41.868 --> 06:17:41.878 align:start position:0%
rest of them
 
06:17:44.750 --> 06:17:44.760 align:start position:0%
in order to be able to do an analysis
 
06:17:47.208 --> 06:17:47.218 align:start position:0%
and I think dra can say this better than
 
06:17:48.530 --> 06:17:48.540 align:start position:0%
I can
 
06:17:51.708 --> 06:17:51.718 align:start position:0%
um but it's going to take two good years
 
06:17:55.368 --> 06:17:55.378 align:start position:0%
of complete data and we won't have be
 
06:17:58.670 --> 06:17:58.680 align:start position:0%
mostly complete until a year after the
 
06:18:01.128 --> 06:18:01.138 align:start position:0%
tax year that we're talking about so
 
06:18:04.970 --> 06:18:04.980 align:start position:0%
that takes us to Middle 25 which means
 
06:18:07.628 --> 06:18:07.638 align:start position:0%
that we'd have to pass a bill
 
06:18:07.638 --> 06:18:09.470 align:start position:0%
that we'd have to pass a bill
426.

06:18:09.470 --> 06:18:09.480 align:start position:0%
426.
 
06:18:13.010 --> 06:18:13.020 align:start position:0%
so on I see that we've got Carolyn and
 
06:18:14.990 --> 06:18:15.000 align:start position:0%
Melissa up and I'm going to stop talking
 
06:18:17.150 --> 06:18:17.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:18:19.010 --> 06:18:19.020 align:start position:0%
well thank you
 
06:18:19.020 --> 06:18:23.270 align:start position:0%
well thank you
um

06:18:23.270 --> 06:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:25.150 --> 06:18:25.160 align:start position:0%
can I say something
 
06:18:28.910 --> 06:18:28.920 align:start position:0%
because I'd like to get the era go ahead
 
06:18:28.920 --> 06:18:30.010 align:start position:0%
because I'd like to get the era go ahead
um

06:18:30.010 --> 06:18:30.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:18:32.690 --> 06:18:32.700 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
06:18:34.670 --> 06:18:34.680 align:start position:0%
what I what I told
 
06:18:36.830 --> 06:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
interestingly enough
 
06:18:40.430 --> 06:18:40.440 align:start position:0%
to probably stand up rather than dra
 
06:18:43.448 --> 06:18:43.458 align:start position:0%
you know what was missing last year
 
06:18:45.770 --> 06:18:45.780 align:start position:0%
I need enough senate had hearings on
 
06:18:47.330 --> 06:18:47.340 align:start position:0%
this but
 
06:18:50.530 --> 06:18:50.540 align:start position:0%
we like to have errands I told Bill RMG
 
06:18:53.810 --> 06:18:53.820 align:start position:0%
we get a few companies you think it's a
 
06:18:55.970 --> 06:18:55.980 align:start position:0%
great idea we want to hear from you
 
06:18:58.730 --> 06:18:58.740 align:start position:0%
I want to know what aesthetic was told I
 
06:18:59.750 --> 06:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
want to know what the government was
 
06:18:59.760 --> 06:19:01.850 align:start position:0%
want to know what the government was
called

06:19:01.850 --> 06:19:01.860 align:start position:0%
called
 
06:19:04.730 --> 06:19:04.740 align:start position:0%
we have no idea what they were talking
 
06:19:07.610 --> 06:19:07.620 align:start position:0%
and they should come and testify before
 
06:19:10.730 --> 06:19:10.740 align:start position:0%
us as to what what made them think that
 
06:19:13.850 --> 06:19:13.860 align:start position:0%
this was risk for you
 
06:19:16.128 --> 06:19:16.138 align:start position:0%
that that's basically my position I
 
06:19:19.070 --> 06:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
think most of us had agreed last year
 
06:19:20.890 --> 06:19:20.900 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:19:23.868 --> 06:19:23.878 align:start position:0%
I think before we go to questions I'd
 
06:19:27.590 --> 06:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
like to get the IRA
 
06:19:29.628 --> 06:19:29.638 align:start position:0%
have their input and then we'll go to
 
06:19:29.638 --> 06:19:32.470 align:start position:0%
have their input and then we'll go to
questions

06:19:32.470 --> 06:19:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:36.590 --> 06:19:36.600 align:start position:0%
okay so uh from the dra we have both
 
06:19:40.510 --> 06:19:40.520 align:start position:0%
Carolyn and Melissa we both want to
 
06:19:43.970 --> 06:19:43.980 align:start position:0%
join o1
 
06:19:47.510 --> 06:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
at least you want to listen from the dra
 
06:19:49.368 --> 06:19:49.378 align:start position:0%
sure thank you Mr chair for the record
 
06:19:50.990 --> 06:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
Melissa Rollins again with New Hampshire
 
06:19:53.270 --> 06:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue and with me online
 
06:19:55.548 --> 06:19:55.558 align:start position:0%
also is Karen Carolyn Lear assistant
 
06:19:56.990 --> 06:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner for the Department of
 
06:19:57.000 --> 06:19:57.830 align:start position:0%
commissioner for the Department of
Revenue

06:19:57.830 --> 06:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
Revenue
 
06:20:00.110 --> 06:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
thank you representative abrami for
 
06:20:01.730 --> 06:20:01.740 align:start position:0%
doing such a great job of explaining
 
06:20:03.830 --> 06:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
this bill as well as being supplemented
 
06:20:06.288 --> 06:20:06.298 align:start position:0%
by representative Ami making my job a
 
06:20:07.730 --> 06:20:07.740 align:start position:0%
little bit easier
 
06:20:10.368 --> 06:20:10.378 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to cover section one first
 
06:20:13.010 --> 06:20:13.020 align:start position:0%
just to get that part out of the way um
 
06:20:14.448 --> 06:20:14.458 align:start position:0%
because it's sort of quick and easy
 
06:20:16.430 --> 06:20:16.440 align:start position:0%
representative Brahma you covered this
 
06:20:18.590 --> 06:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
well the section one of this bill is
 
06:20:20.510 --> 06:20:20.520 align:start position:0%
really just removing
 
06:20:22.430 --> 06:20:22.440 align:start position:0%
um the statute for weighted
 
06:20:25.128 --> 06:20:25.138 align:start position:0%
apportionment Factor under the tax
 
06:20:27.708 --> 06:20:27.718 align:start position:0%
expenditure report statute for a report
 
06:20:30.230 --> 06:20:30.240 align:start position:0%
that typically takes us a few hours to
 
06:20:32.270 --> 06:20:32.280 align:start position:0%
complete yet really doesn't have any
 
06:20:33.948 --> 06:20:33.958 align:start position:0%
valid information anymore so it's
 
06:20:37.070 --> 06:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
swapping that out with a now more valid
 
06:20:39.530 --> 06:20:39.540 align:start position:0%
statute for a new credit Regional Career
 
06:20:42.170 --> 06:20:42.180 align:start position:0%
and Technical education credit adding
 
06:20:43.970 --> 06:20:43.980 align:start position:0%
that to the statute so we can make sure
 
06:20:46.190 --> 06:20:46.200 align:start position:0%
we meet our statutory obligation and
 
06:20:47.810 --> 06:20:47.820 align:start position:0%
report that each year
 
06:20:49.970 --> 06:20:49.980 align:start position:0%
so we we really like that part of the
 
06:20:49.980 --> 06:20:51.470 align:start position:0%
so we we really like that part of the
statue

06:20:51.470 --> 06:20:51.480 align:start position:0%
statue
 
06:20:53.690 --> 06:20:53.700 align:start position:0%
um now on to a market big sourcing
 
06:20:55.730 --> 06:20:55.740 align:start position:0%
in single sales Factor again I think
 
06:20:57.590 --> 06:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
representative abrami did a great job
 
06:21:01.368 --> 06:21:01.378 align:start position:0%
explaining this statue again just as a
 
06:21:03.708 --> 06:21:03.718 align:start position:0%
high level to hit it again for the new
 
06:21:06.948 --> 06:21:06.958 align:start position:0%
members cost to Performance is where we
 
06:21:10.310 --> 06:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
are at last year we just started with
 
06:21:12.650 --> 06:21:12.660 align:start position:0%
Market base the beginning of this year
 
06:21:16.670 --> 06:21:16.680 align:start position:0%
so you know 27 days ago
 
06:21:18.948 --> 06:21:18.958 align:start position:0%
um so cost of performance again is that
 
06:21:21.230 --> 06:21:21.240 align:start position:0%
when it's intangible sales and services
 
06:21:23.930 --> 06:21:23.940 align:start position:0%
are portioned based on where the
 
06:21:26.150 --> 06:21:26.160 align:start position:0%
services was performed
 
06:21:28.788 --> 06:21:28.798 align:start position:0%
right and now switching to market-based
 
06:21:31.128 --> 06:21:31.138 align:start position:0%
sourcing starting this year it's where
 
06:21:33.170 --> 06:21:33.180 align:start position:0%
those intangible sales and services are
 
06:21:34.730 --> 06:21:34.740 align:start position:0%
now a portioned to where the End
 
06:21:36.110 --> 06:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
customer is
 
06:21:37.730 --> 06:21:37.740 align:start position:0%
so that's the biggest difference there
 
06:21:40.368 --> 06:21:40.378 align:start position:0%
so the timing for this switching those
 
06:21:42.590 --> 06:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
single sales out and pushing the date
 
06:21:45.470 --> 06:21:45.480 align:start position:0%
out is really like representative abrami
 
06:21:47.750 --> 06:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
said is to give time
 
06:21:47.760 --> 06:21:49.788 align:start position:0%
said is to give time
for

06:21:49.788 --> 06:21:49.798 align:start position:0%
for
 
06:21:52.070 --> 06:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
a report to be done and really Analyze
 
06:21:54.830 --> 06:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
That full impact of Market market-based
 
06:21:57.230 --> 06:21:57.240 align:start position:0%
sourcing I think again representative
 
06:21:59.090 --> 06:21:59.100 align:start position:0%
Almy also alluded to this with
 
06:22:00.890 --> 06:22:00.900 align:start position:0%
market-based sourcing You're Now sort of
 
06:22:02.750 --> 06:22:02.760 align:start position:0%
switching your customer base you're
 
06:22:06.110 --> 06:22:06.120 align:start position:0%
pulling in new customers based on those
 
06:22:08.090 --> 06:22:08.100 align:start position:0%
sales being to the End customer we
 
06:22:09.890 --> 06:22:09.900 align:start position:0%
didn't have those before so we're
 
06:22:11.448 --> 06:22:11.458 align:start position:0%
pulling in this new customer base that
 
06:22:13.910 --> 06:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
we didn't have previously and we're also
 
06:22:17.090 --> 06:22:17.100 align:start position:0%
losing some because it's people who were
 
06:22:18.770 --> 06:22:18.780 align:start position:0%
now based at where they perform and they
 
06:22:21.650 --> 06:22:21.660 align:start position:0%
only Outsource outside of New Hampshire
 
06:22:23.330 --> 06:22:23.340 align:start position:0%
we're losing those and there's no way
 
06:22:25.548 --> 06:22:25.558 align:start position:0%
for us to identify that fiscal impact at
 
06:22:27.890 --> 06:22:27.900 align:start position:0%
this point so in order to get a fiscal
 
06:22:31.250 --> 06:22:31.260 align:start position:0%
impact we really need the implementation
 
06:22:33.170 --> 06:22:33.180 align:start position:0%
um pushed out some before single sales
 
06:22:35.690 --> 06:22:35.700 align:start position:0%
comes in with current law having single
 
06:22:38.690 --> 06:22:38.700 align:start position:0%
sales start is fine we can administer
 
06:22:40.788 --> 06:22:40.798 align:start position:0%
that yet it does
 
06:22:42.530 --> 06:22:42.540 align:start position:0%
um sort of
 
06:22:44.868 --> 06:22:44.878 align:start position:0%
make the situation a little bit murky
 
06:22:47.628 --> 06:22:47.638 align:start position:0%
because you have these new taxpayers and
 
06:22:49.250 --> 06:22:49.260 align:start position:0%
now they're filing single sales and we
 
06:22:52.690 --> 06:22:52.700 align:start position:0%
don't know which impact is due to which
 
06:22:55.128 --> 06:22:55.138 align:start position:0%
apportionment change
 
06:22:58.070 --> 06:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
so it does sound like it's pushed out
 
06:23:01.330 --> 06:23:01.340 align:start position:0%
far when we say December 31st 2026
 
06:23:04.548 --> 06:23:04.558 align:start position:0%
however it's important to note that a
 
06:23:06.590 --> 06:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
tax year doesn't complete until two
 
06:23:08.448 --> 06:23:08.458 align:start position:0%
years later and that's because of fiscal
 
06:23:11.810 --> 06:23:11.820 align:start position:0%
year filers so we won't have for just
 
06:23:13.670 --> 06:23:13.680 align:start position:0%
market-based sourcing alone we won't
 
06:23:15.948 --> 06:23:15.958 align:start position:0%
have a complete tax year on market-based
 
06:23:20.510 --> 06:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
sourcing until August of 2023
 
06:23:23.030 --> 06:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
and that will be our first year and then
 
06:23:24.708 --> 06:23:24.718 align:start position:0%
it adds another year and there to sort
 
06:23:26.570 --> 06:23:26.580 align:start position:0%
of get us that compliance going of
 
06:23:28.430 --> 06:23:28.440 align:start position:0%
getting those new taxpayers on board to
 
06:23:30.948 --> 06:23:30.958 align:start position:0%
file market-based sourcing so then when
 
06:23:33.890 --> 06:23:33.900 align:start position:0%
we can file our anticipated report which
 
06:23:35.990 --> 06:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
is in section three of the bill which is
 
06:23:39.650 --> 06:23:39.660 align:start position:0%
due November 1st 2024 we now have
 
06:23:41.570 --> 06:23:41.580 align:start position:0%
relevant data because at that point we
 
06:23:43.730 --> 06:23:43.740 align:start position:0%
should have the bulk of these
 
06:23:47.208 --> 06:23:47.218 align:start position:0%
market-based sourcing taxpayers into our
 
06:23:49.310 --> 06:23:49.320 align:start position:0%
system and we can do that analysis to
 
06:23:51.650 --> 06:23:51.660 align:start position:0%
say hey what would it look like now if
 
06:23:53.868 --> 06:23:53.878 align:start position:0%
we switched from that three Factor
 
06:23:55.610 --> 06:23:55.620 align:start position:0%
apportionment which we are currently at
 
06:23:57.770 --> 06:23:57.780 align:start position:0%
again payroll property double weighted
 
06:24:00.190 --> 06:24:00.200 align:start position:0%
sales where we switch it over to that
 
06:24:02.330 --> 06:24:02.340 align:start position:0%
single sales
 
06:24:05.090 --> 06:24:05.100 align:start position:0%
Factor so that's the reason for that
 
06:24:06.770 --> 06:24:06.780 align:start position:0%
push out and then it gives you time to
 
06:24:08.750 --> 06:24:08.760 align:start position:0%
implement the bill and see what the
 
06:24:11.030 --> 06:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact is and decide if you if
 
06:24:13.128 --> 06:24:13.138 align:start position:0%
you want that bill
 
06:24:14.990 --> 06:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
I think I covered everything I wanted
 
06:24:17.390 --> 06:24:17.400 align:start position:0%
but happy to answer any questions if I
 
06:24:19.490 --> 06:24:19.500 align:start position:0%
missed something now that we've heard
 
06:24:23.030 --> 06:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:25.190 --> 06:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
do we have any questions
 
06:24:25.200 --> 06:24:29.340 align:start position:0%
do we have any questions
panelists

06:24:29.340 --> 06:24:29.350 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:29.350 --> 06:24:35.510 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

06:24:35.510 --> 06:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:37.490 --> 06:24:37.500 align:start position:0%
wow you guys have done a great job
 
06:24:41.350 --> 06:24:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:44.448 --> 06:24:44.458 align:start position:0%
correct I don't see any wins don't keep
 
06:24:44.458 --> 06:24:45.230 align:start position:0%
correct I don't see any wins don't keep
looking

06:24:45.230 --> 06:24:45.240 align:start position:0%
looking
 
06:24:48.970 --> 06:24:48.980 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:54.048 --> 06:24:54.058 align:start position:0%
one name on the blue sheet or Rock bomb
 
06:24:56.150 --> 06:24:56.160 align:start position:0%
representing himself
 
06:25:00.470 --> 06:25:00.480 align:start position:0%
and he supports the bill
 
06:25:02.270 --> 06:25:02.280 align:start position:0%
since there's nobody else there to
 
06:25:05.448 --> 06:25:05.458 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:07.850 --> 06:25:07.860 align:start position:0%
care contact versus representative
 
06:25:10.548 --> 06:25:10.558 align:start position:0%
LeBron in your example you used a
 
06:25:14.170 --> 06:25:14.180 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:19.128 --> 06:25:19.138 align:start position:0%
we prefer this until 2024. nothing
 
06:25:19.138 --> 06:25:24.610 align:start position:0%
we prefer this until 2024. nothing
because

06:25:24.610 --> 06:25:24.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:27.650 --> 06:25:27.660 align:start position:0%
he's a service provider
 
06:25:30.670 --> 06:25:30.680 align:start position:0%
based Justin New Hampshire this
 
06:25:33.048 --> 06:25:33.058 align:start position:0%
facilities in New Hampshire
 
06:25:35.330 --> 06:25:35.340 align:start position:0%
and his employees are in the future
 
06:25:38.628 --> 06:25:38.638 align:start position:0%
so he won't be impacted by the other two
 
06:25:38.638 --> 06:25:46.910 align:start position:0%
so he won't be impacted by the other two
factors

06:25:46.910 --> 06:25:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:48.350 --> 06:25:48.360 align:start position:0%
in other words
 
06:25:51.230 --> 06:25:51.240 align:start position:0%
he doesn't have facility in other states
 
06:25:53.810 --> 06:25:53.820 align:start position:0%
and he doesn't have employees working in
 
06:25:55.548 --> 06:25:55.558 align:start position:0%
other states which are the other two
 
06:25:58.970 --> 06:25:58.980 align:start position:0%
factors right so he's basically sales
 
06:26:01.070 --> 06:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
but he's he's a different kind of sales
 
06:26:03.230 --> 06:26:03.240 align:start position:0%
and that he's
 
06:26:05.390 --> 06:26:05.400 align:start position:0%
uh Services he providing service sales
 
06:26:08.448 --> 06:26:08.458 align:start position:0%
of service essentially
 
06:26:16.750 --> 06:26:16.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:19.788 --> 06:26:19.798 align:start position:0%
don't pay taxes or pain
 
06:26:25.810 --> 06:26:25.820 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:35.868 --> 06:26:35.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:40.730 --> 06:26:40.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:44.030 --> 06:26:44.040 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit hard for me to hear so
 
06:26:45.890 --> 06:26:45.900 align:start position:0%
I couldn't hear the original question or
 
06:26:48.170 --> 06:26:48.180 align:start position:0%
the response sorry about that
 
06:26:48.180 --> 06:26:50.690 align:start position:0%
the response sorry about that
route

06:26:50.690 --> 06:26:50.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:50.700 --> 06:26:52.310 align:start position:0%
 
yes

06:26:52.310 --> 06:26:52.320 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:26:52.320 --> 06:26:53.628 align:start position:0%
yes
so

06:26:53.628 --> 06:26:53.638 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:26:56.150 --> 06:26:56.160 align:start position:0%
um his business is a service business
 
06:26:58.430 --> 06:26:58.440 align:start position:0%
all this facility is based in New
 
06:27:00.288 --> 06:27:00.298 align:start position:0%
Hampshire this building
 
06:27:03.110 --> 06:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
his employees are all in New Hampshire
 
06:27:04.788 --> 06:27:04.798 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
06:27:06.948 --> 06:27:06.958 align:start position:0%
and he but he sells to other states
 
06:27:09.770 --> 06:27:09.780 align:start position:0%
without the product he's buying another
 
06:27:11.510 --> 06:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
from other states selling a product
 
06:27:13.190 --> 06:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
never stuck the product never touched
 
06:27:15.288 --> 06:27:15.298 align:start position:0%
space in New Hampshire for those users
 
06:27:16.430 --> 06:27:16.440 align:start position:0%
are broken
 
06:27:19.850 --> 06:27:19.860 align:start position:0%
so the question is if Will single sales
 
06:27:23.570 --> 06:27:23.580 align:start position:0%
going the single sales Factor impact 10.
 
06:27:26.810 --> 06:27:26.820 align:start position:0%
I think it will pay no tax in New
 
06:27:26.820 --> 06:27:32.650 align:start position:0%
I think it will pay no tax in New
Hampshire

06:27:32.650 --> 06:27:32.660 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:35.690 --> 06:27:35.700 align:start position:0%
in that scenario
 
06:27:39.170 --> 06:27:39.180 align:start position:0%
okay he's a service company
 
06:27:41.628 --> 06:27:41.638 align:start position:0%
uh with all this physical plants here
 
06:27:43.250 --> 06:27:43.260 align:start position:0%
and all those payroll here
 
06:27:46.128 --> 06:27:46.138 align:start position:0%
what will happen to his taxes
 
06:27:50.048 --> 06:27:50.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:52.070 --> 06:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
this is Carolyn Lear assistant
 
06:27:53.390 --> 06:27:53.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner at the Department of
 
06:27:55.070 --> 06:27:55.080 align:start position:0%
Revenue I think
 
06:27:58.490 --> 06:27:58.500 align:start position:0%
certainly single sales Factor would
 
06:27:58.500 --> 06:28:00.470 align:start position:0%
certainly single sales Factor would
impact

06:28:00.470 --> 06:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
impact
 
06:28:03.548 --> 06:28:03.558 align:start position:0%
um this hypothetical taxpayer who has
 
06:28:06.830 --> 06:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire employees and property
 
06:28:11.150 --> 06:28:11.160 align:start position:0%
because currently his um tax base is in
 
06:28:14.830 --> 06:28:14.840 align:start position:0%
part being dictated by his New Hampshire
 
06:28:17.510 --> 06:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
employees and property that makes up
 
06:28:19.970 --> 06:28:19.980 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of how we calculate his tax
 
06:28:23.570 --> 06:28:23.580 align:start position:0%
liability going forward single sales
 
06:28:26.868 --> 06:28:26.878 align:start position:0%
Factor would be the only way we would um
 
06:28:28.730 --> 06:28:28.740 align:start position:0%
calculate his New Hampshire tax
 
06:28:31.850 --> 06:28:31.860 align:start position:0%
liability so his New Hampshire
 
06:28:34.250 --> 06:28:34.260 align:start position:0%
um employees and property would no
 
06:28:38.510 --> 06:28:38.520 align:start position:0%
longer dictate his overall tax liability
 
06:28:40.730 --> 06:28:40.740 align:start position:0%
um that being said I think the
 
06:28:42.830 --> 06:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
unfairness that this hypothetical
 
06:28:45.350 --> 06:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
taxpayer was concerned with initially
 
06:28:49.610 --> 06:28:49.620 align:start position:0%
was mostly the market-based sourcing
 
06:28:52.490 --> 06:28:52.500 align:start position:0%
versus cost of performance inconsistency
 
06:28:55.670 --> 06:28:55.680 align:start position:0%
among the states and not so much the
 
06:28:57.788 --> 06:28:57.798 align:start position:0%
sales Factor
 
06:29:01.430 --> 06:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
follow up but with that
 
06:29:01.440 --> 06:29:02.690 align:start position:0%
follow up but with that
um

06:29:02.690 --> 06:29:02.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:29:04.670 --> 06:29:04.680 align:start position:0%
basically he wouldn't be paying any tax
 
06:29:06.470 --> 06:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire correct if we want a
 
06:29:07.850 --> 06:29:07.860 align:start position:0%
single sales Factor
 
06:29:11.570 --> 06:29:11.580 align:start position:0%
if a taxpayer who has no
 
06:29:14.390 --> 06:29:14.400 align:start position:0%
um no clients in the state and is
 
06:29:16.490 --> 06:29:16.500 align:start position:0%
providing services to you know if their
 
06:29:18.288 --> 06:29:18.298 align:start position:0%
business is the provision of services to
 
06:29:20.810 --> 06:29:20.820 align:start position:0%
clients and his clients are all future
 
06:29:22.670 --> 06:29:22.680 align:start position:0%
states he probably does not have a
 
06:29:24.350 --> 06:29:24.360 align:start position:0%
liability in New Hampshire under single
 
06:29:26.510 --> 06:29:26.520 align:start position:0%
sales Factor
 
06:29:30.890 --> 06:29:30.900 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:33.048 --> 06:29:33.058 align:start position:0%
I was solved when we went to Miami
 
06:29:33.058 --> 06:29:35.150 align:start position:0%
I was solved when we went to Miami
resource

06:29:35.150 --> 06:29:35.160 align:start position:0%
resource
 
06:29:37.010 --> 06:29:37.020 align:start position:0%
and now
 
06:29:39.890 --> 06:29:39.900 align:start position:0%
we're not really sure
 
06:29:39.900 --> 06:29:41.628 align:start position:0%
we're not really sure
about

06:29:41.628 --> 06:29:41.638 align:start position:0%
about
 
06:29:46.090 --> 06:29:46.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:48.410 --> 06:29:48.420 align:start position:0%
all right all right we're going to lose
 
06:29:54.650 --> 06:29:54.660 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:56.448 --> 06:29:56.458 align:start position:0%
how many owls are out there in New
 
06:29:58.010 --> 06:29:58.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that are going to not have
 
06:30:01.070 --> 06:30:01.080 align:start position:0%
that liability but also how many
 
06:30:03.670 --> 06:30:03.680 align:start position:0%
Sam's are out there from other states
 
06:30:07.430 --> 06:30:07.440 align:start position:0%
that they're gonna that we can tax okay
 
06:30:10.430 --> 06:30:10.440 align:start position:0%
now that's done now could could I just
 
06:30:14.030 --> 06:30:14.040 align:start position:0%
another question yes thank you
 
06:30:14.040 --> 06:30:14.570 align:start position:0%
another question yes thank you
um

06:30:14.570 --> 06:30:14.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:30:16.788 --> 06:30:16.798 align:start position:0%
so I couldn't remember
 
06:30:20.150 --> 06:30:20.160 align:start position:0%
he wouldn't have to pay bet either so he
 
06:30:23.330 --> 06:30:23.340 align:start position:0%
would be paying nothing at state level
 
06:30:27.830 --> 06:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
only his property tax on to to take care
 
06:30:30.288 --> 06:30:30.298 align:start position:0%
of his employees to take care of his
 
06:30:33.048 --> 06:30:33.058 align:start position:0%
Public Safety to take care of a whole
 
06:30:35.208 --> 06:30:35.218 align:start position:0%
range of other government services that
 
06:30:37.368 --> 06:30:37.378 align:start position:0%
he uses in the state
 
06:30:39.770 --> 06:30:39.780 align:start position:0%
he'd be paying them to Maine
 
06:30:41.990 --> 06:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
I was just turning into the discussion
 
06:30:46.310 --> 06:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
with the chair but uh Melissa our
 
06:30:46.320 --> 06:30:48.470 align:start position:0%
with the chair but uh Melissa our
property

06:30:48.470 --> 06:30:48.480 align:start position:0%
property
 
06:30:51.170 --> 06:30:51.180 align:start position:0%
what what uh
 
06:30:54.048 --> 06:30:54.058 align:start position:0%
he would he has employees here so he
 
06:30:56.810 --> 06:30:56.820 align:start position:0%
would call him smoking banks in bet
 
06:30:59.448 --> 06:30:59.458 align:start position:0%
right a taxpayer who has employees in
 
06:31:03.650 --> 06:31:03.660 align:start position:0%
the state would still pay the BET
 
06:31:05.570 --> 06:31:05.580 align:start position:0%
um apportionment doesn't really impact
 
06:31:10.910 --> 06:31:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:13.250 --> 06:31:13.260 align:start position:0%
always played
