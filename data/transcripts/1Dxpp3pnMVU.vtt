00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:08.360 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 1333 and called
 
00:04:12.429 --> 00:04:12.439 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 align:start position:0%
Day good morning Madam chair and the
 
00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 align:start position:0%
rest of the
 
00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 align:start position:0%
committee uh for the record my name is
 
00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 align:start position:0%
Mark PR I represent Hillsboro 15 which
 
00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
is Manchester Ward 8 I feel like I'm
 
00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 align:start position:0%
back in the committee I've been here so
 
00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 align:start position:0%
often but that's okay nice to see
 
00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 align:start position:0%
friendly faces so I'm bringing uh this
 
00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
bill forward to prevent the state from
 
00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 align:start position:0%
using electric vehicles for 10 years
 
00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 align:start position:0%
because I don't believe that technology
 
00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
is where it needs to be and it'll end up
 
00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.600 align:start position:0%
costing the state more
 
00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 align:start position:0%
money uh my first concern as a
 
00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 align:start position:0%
firefighter wrer um I've been reading
 
00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880 align:start position:0%
about it seeing it haven't really
 
00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:06.919 align:start position:0%
experienced firsthand but Town Two Towns
 
00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
over had had one um the safety hazard is
 
00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:15.199 align:start position:0%
fire uh the batteries tend to run away
 
00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:17.759 align:start position:0%
fairly easy and it's called a thermal
 
00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:21.759 align:start position:0%
runaway and they just kind of ignite
 
00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:24.600 align:start position:0%
burn twice as hot as a regular
 
00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.150 align:start position:0%
burn twice as hot as a regular
carire

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
carire
 
00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:29.639 align:start position:0%
uh the bad part of that is soon as that
 
00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:32.360 align:start position:0%
happens the electrical system in the car
 
00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
shuts down and the doors are electric
 
00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:39.160 align:start position:0%
you cannot get out and now due to
 
00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:41.039 align:start position:0%
Federal mandates all the windows are
 
00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:43.199 align:start position:0%
laminate so you can't just hit them with
 
00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.240 align:start position:0%
a hammer and they crumble like they used
 
00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:47.800 align:start position:0%
to you have to actually rip the windows
 
00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:49.840 align:start position:0%
out or cut them with a
 
00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
saw um so it makes it harder to get out
 
00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:57.720 align:start position:0%
uh we have noticed that in a lot of
 
00:05:59.469 --> 00:05:59.479 align:start position:0%
these carf fires you find all the
 
00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:01.240 align:start position:0%
occupants in the back seat trying to get
 
00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:05.560 align:start position:0%
away from the smoke and the fire the
 
00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.120 align:start position:0%
other thing that happens when these
 
00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:10.160 align:start position:0%
batteries run away they create toxic
 
00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:12.639 align:start position:0%
fumes that kill you before the smoke
 
00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:17.039 align:start position:0%
would so you can't get out you
 
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 align:start position:0%
trapped and for us on the fire side what
 
00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
used to take us less than a th000
 
00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
gallons to put out a carire now it takes
 
00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:28.919 align:start position:0%
us 30 to 40,000 gallons to manage these
 
00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:31.840 align:start position:0%
and I say manage cuz we really can't put
 
00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:33.880 align:start position:0%
them out for a long period we're cooling
 
00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:36.639 align:start position:0%
it down so the thermal stops we have to
 
00:06:38.589 --> 00:06:38.599 align:start position:0%
cool it for an hour wait 45 minutes to
 
00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:40.720 align:start position:0%
see if it starts then if you can get a
 
00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
tow truck to actually take it the
 
00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:44.680 align:start position:0%
firetruck has to follow the tow truck in
 
00:06:47.309 --> 00:06:47.319 align:start position:0%
case it starts again in their lot they
 
00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:49.720 align:start position:0%
have to keep them separate
 
00:06:52.629 --> 00:06:52.639 align:start position:0%
right that's the safety
 
00:06:58.230 --> 00:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
thing now we get into the batteries
 
00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
right with with these big batteries the
 
00:07:03.469 --> 00:07:03.479 align:start position:0%
weight of the car is twice of what the
 
00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:05.919 align:start position:0%
uh regular vehicle would
 
00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:08.280 align:start position:0%
be um I have another build that
 
00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:09.720 align:start position:0%
addresses some of
 
00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
that but replacement is pretty expensive
 
00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:18.800 align:start position:0%
I was uh just watching a report
 
00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:23.360 align:start position:0%
um that Hyundai a person was driving ran
 
00:07:25.629 --> 00:07:25.639 align:start position:0%
over a muffler that fell off dented the
 
00:07:27.869 --> 00:07:27.879 align:start position:0%
battery bad enough that it was damaged
 
00:07:30.189 --> 00:07:30.199 align:start position:0%
first of all noal local shop will touch
 
00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:32.440 align:start position:0%
it the autobodies won't touch it it has
 
00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:35.160 align:start position:0%
to go back to the dealer the price to
 
00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:43.029 --> 00:07:43.039 align:start position:0%
$61,000 because they don't keep them in
 
00:07:44.749 --> 00:07:44.759 align:start position:0%
stock they weigh so much and they have
 
00:07:46.589 --> 00:07:46.599 align:start position:0%
to come for the Hyundai they have to
 
00:07:47.749 --> 00:07:47.759 align:start position:0%
come from
 
00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:51.080 align:start position:0%
Korea and for the battery it was
 
00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
61,000 I got to think that's got to be
 
00:07:57.909 --> 00:07:57.919 align:start position:0%
the almost the price of the car but and
 
00:07:59.589 --> 00:07:59.599 align:start position:0%
that's what happens the batteries
 
00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:02.800 align:start position:0%
eventually wear out up here in New
 
00:08:06.469 --> 00:08:06.479 align:start position:0%
England cold affects any battery
 
00:08:10.749 --> 00:08:10.759 align:start position:0%
shortens the life of that charge so you
 
00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:12.800 align:start position:0%
used to be able to get 300 if it's
 
00:08:15.909 --> 00:08:15.919 align:start position:0%
really cold that day you may get 150
 
00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:18.520 align:start position:0%
miles right so there's definitely
 
00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:21.400 align:start position:0%
problems with these um finding charging
 
00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:23.400 align:start position:0%
stations for
 
00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:25.360 align:start position:0%
them and
 
00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:28.280 align:start position:0%
then when that battery does wear out
 
00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:32.080 align:start position:0%
three four five years are you going to
 
00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:34.680 align:start position:0%
replace it or are you going to get rid
 
00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
of the car I know and this is a little
 
00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:40.919 align:start position:0%
bit of an older story that in Paris when
 
00:08:43.029 --> 00:08:43.039 align:start position:0%
they kind of first all came out they
 
00:08:45.949 --> 00:08:45.959 align:start position:0%
went all electric the battery started
 
00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:48.360 align:start position:0%
wearing out on these cars they went to
 
00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
replace them and found out that it was
 
00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:52.680 align:start position:0%
very expensive to do so they said well
 
00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:54.920 align:start position:0%
we don't want to do that we'll just buy
 
00:08:57.269 --> 00:08:57.279 align:start position:0%
new ones and get rid of these cars
 
00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:00.160 align:start position:0%
nobody wanted them because the battery
 
00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:01.760 align:start position:0%
is a hazardous
 
00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:05.000 align:start position:0%
material so they had a big field that
 
00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:08.120 align:start position:0%
the city owned and now there are cars
 
00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:09.880 align:start position:0%
sitting there rotting away because
 
00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:14.320 align:start position:0%
there's no place else to get rid of them
 
00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:19.160 align:start position:0%
so I see at this time uh the other piece
 
00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:22.200 align:start position:0%
is the material raw materials for the
 
00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:25.160 align:start position:0%
batteries a lot of it comes from
 
00:09:27.069 --> 00:09:27.079 align:start position:0%
countries that really don't like
 
00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:29.880 align:start position:0%
us and at any time they could would say
 
00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
yeah we're not sending you anymore or
 
00:09:34.269 --> 00:09:34.279 align:start position:0%
not building you any more batteries and
 
00:09:36.389 --> 00:09:36.399 align:start position:0%
now we're kind of stuck with all these
 
00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:38.360 align:start position:0%
cars or this technology that we're
 
00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:42.880 align:start position:0%
moving to that you can't continue so I
 
00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
just see that there's a lot of problems
 
00:09:46.069 --> 00:09:46.079 align:start position:0%
with it I see that it's going to cost
 
00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:49.000 align:start position:0%
State payers more money in the long run
 
00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:52.720 align:start position:0%
at least that's what I believe um and
 
00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
with that I'll end my testimony and take
 
00:09:57.790 --> 00:09:57.800 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative are
 
00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:00.040 align:start position:0%
there questions
 
00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:03.030 align:start position:0%
there questions
representative

00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:05.560 align:start position:0%
Schmid now why don't you tell us how you
 
00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:06.509 align:start position:0%
Schmid now why don't you tell us how you
really

00:10:06.509 --> 00:10:06.519 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:09.480 align:start position:0%
feel you don't want representative
 
00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
Schmid that was that was just a that was
 
00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:15.040 align:start position:0%
disrespectful representative Pro and I
 
00:10:17.269 --> 00:10:17.279 align:start position:0%
are long time long time friends he
 
00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:19.880 align:start position:0%
wouldn't believe it was me if I didn't
 
00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:24.240 align:start position:0%
correct so uh thank you for this very
 
00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:25.590 align:start position:0%
correct so uh thank you for this very
interesting

00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
interesting
 
00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:28.720 align:start position:0%
presentation and I'm wondering why why
 
00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
do you think that the state would even
 
00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:33.200 align:start position:0%
possibly be interested you you can't be
 
00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:35.200 align:start position:0%
the only one that knows the problems
 
00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:37.320 align:start position:0%
there's a request for bid for electric
 
00:10:41.389 --> 00:10:41.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:44.069 --> 00:10:44.079 align:start position:0%
state thank you that's interesting to
 
00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
know okay anyone
 
00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
else representative Brown good morning
 
00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh thanks for
 
00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
taking my question do you have a an idea
 
00:10:58.750 --> 00:10:58.760 align:start position:0%
of how many EV car fires we're seeing in
 
00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:00.670 align:start position:0%
of how many EV car fires we're seeing in
New

00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:00.680 align:start position:0%
New
 
00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I don't have an exact number
 
00:11:06.269 --> 00:11:06.279 align:start position:0%
but I know they're on the increase and I
 
00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:09.480 align:start position:0%
can tell you other carire stories if you
 
00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:11.320 align:start position:0%
want but I figured I wouldn't waste your
 
00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:15.160 align:start position:0%
time with it there are some and
 
00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:19.800 align:start position:0%
and they are twice as hot twice as fast
 
00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
and sometimes they
 
00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:24.760 align:start position:0%
catastrophic they'll
 
00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
detonate black thank you so you talked
 
00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:31.880 align:start position:0%
about some departments you know Public
 
00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:34.720 align:start position:0%
Safety out uh departments uh buying
 
00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
these things are they buying cars or
 
00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
they're actually trying to buy trucks
 
00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:39.750 align:start position:0%
they're actually trying to buy trucks
or

00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
so they're electric there are electric
 
00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
fire trucks and I can't believe that
 
00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
there are uh so but it's a dual power
 
00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
system right so the battery drives the
 
00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
truck to the fire but they use a diesel
 
00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:00.240 align:start position:0%
engine to drive the pump because we know
 
00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:02.440 align:start position:0%
the battery would not last long enough
 
00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:05.320 align:start position:0%
at a big fire and how can you charge it
 
00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:07.880 align:start position:0%
when you're at a fire you can bring
 
00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:12.160 align:start position:0%
diesel to it but you can't bring the big
 
00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:16.440 align:start position:0%
extension cord right thank you okay
 
00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:19.000 align:start position:0%
Representative Patrick thank you madam
 
00:12:22.509 --> 00:12:22.519 align:start position:0%
chair uh through my own research as a
 
00:12:26.509 --> 00:12:26.519 align:start position:0%
consumer I I I can certainly verify
 
00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
everything that you've said uh have you
 
00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
taken into consideration
 
00:12:35.069 --> 00:12:35.079 align:start position:0%
hybrids there still that
 
00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:37.560 align:start position:0%
battery well the hybrids oh I'm not
 
00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
going to get into an argument thank you
 
00:12:41.509 --> 00:12:41.519 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank
 
00:12:45.069 --> 00:12:45.079 align:start position:0%
you representative uh thank
 
00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
you well following on from what he asked
 
00:12:50.069 --> 00:12:50.079 align:start position:0%
are there some brands or types that are
 
00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
better than others or they all have the
 
00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:54.240 align:start position:0%
same problem they all have the same
 
00:12:56.430 --> 00:12:56.440 align:start position:0%
problem they're all the same
 
00:12:58.870 --> 00:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
technology give or take maybe a little a
 
00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:02.480 align:start position:0%
little bit but the battery itself is all
 
00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
the same
 
00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:06.269 align:start position:0%
the same
technology

00:13:06.269 --> 00:13:06.279 align:start position:0%
technology
 
00:13:10.069 --> 00:13:10.079 align:start position:0%
uh they all can have that uh ability to
 
00:13:14.389 --> 00:13:14.399 align:start position:0%
Thermal runaway and and from
 
00:13:17.829 --> 00:13:17.839 align:start position:0%
hoverboards the automobiles same
 
00:13:20.389 --> 00:13:20.399 align:start position:0%
technology we've seen the
 
00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:24.720 align:start position:0%
hoverboards uh detonate in a house while
 
00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:28.040 align:start position:0%
it's charging right and uh they have the
 
00:13:29.389 --> 00:13:29.399 align:start position:0%
electric bike
 
00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:30.720 align:start position:0%
well they don't want to bring them in
 
00:13:32.389 --> 00:13:32.399 align:start position:0%
into the house so they charge them in
 
00:13:34.389 --> 00:13:34.399 align:start position:0%
the hallway of the apartment building
 
00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:35.880 align:start position:0%
and now they have a fire in the hallway
 
00:13:38.389 --> 00:13:38.399 align:start position:0%
and nobody can get out those are some of
 
00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:40.360 align:start position:0%
the things but we're not talking about
 
00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:43.800 align:start position:0%
those but the technology is the same the
 
00:13:46.269 --> 00:13:46.279 align:start position:0%
batteries are the same and they all act
 
00:13:49.509 --> 00:13:49.519 align:start position:0%
the same way thank you
 
00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much thank you
 
00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:57.749 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much thank you

the country last week gave proof that
 
00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
the elect elect car industry though well
 
00:14:32.749 --> 00:14:32.759 align:start position:0%

00:14:46.189 --> 00:14:46.199 align:start position:0%
they don't hold their charge and their
 
00:14:49.189 --> 00:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
mile mileage range is cut by 30 to
 
00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:52.040 align:start position:0%
40% insurance rates are higher for EVS
 
00:14:54.829 --> 00:14:54.839 align:start position:0%
according to a AAA report they're more
 
00:14:56.949 --> 00:14:56.959 align:start position:0%
more prone to damage in an accident and
 
00:15:00.069 --> 00:15:00.079 align:start position:0%
more costly to repair I was privileged
 
00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
to attend a higher uh sorry lost my
 
00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:04.720 align:start position:0%

00:15:14.189 --> 00:15:14.199 align:start position:0%
was shocked to hear some of the concerns
 
00:15:16.069 --> 00:15:16.079 align:start position:0%
brought to light from this training here
 
00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
are some here are just a few electric
 
00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:20.600 align:start position:0%
vehicles immediately shut down when the
 
00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:23.120 align:start position:0%

00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
unless they know where the release is
 
00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
for that vehicle and it's different in
 
00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
every electric brand the fire
 
00:15:34.949 --> 00:15:34.959 align:start position:0%
temperature starts at 2800° and the fire
 
00:15:38.309 --> 00:15:38.319 align:start position:0%
size doubles every 15 seconds the smoke
 
00:15:41.509 --> 00:15:41.519 align:start position:0%
from an EV fire is not smoke it's toxic
 
00:15:44.389 --> 00:15:44.399 align:start position:0%
gas consisting of hydrogen volatile
 
00:15:46.949 --> 00:15:46.959 align:start position:0%

Responders there is currently no fire
 
00:15:55.389 --> 00:15:55.399 align:start position:0%
fighting protocol to fight these fires
 
00:15:57.710 --> 00:15:57.720 align:start position:0%
the fires burn until they burn out and
 
00:16:00.189 --> 00:16:00.199 align:start position:0%
when deprived of ox oxygen they reignite
 
00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
when oxygen hits them as long as a month
 
00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:05.480 align:start position:0%
later these temperatures are so hot that
 
00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
First Responders can't get near the fire
 
00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:10.160 align:start position:0%
as their gear is rated for just 800 de
 
00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:12.600 align:start position:0%
degrees thermal runaway which
 
00:16:14.749 --> 00:16:14.759 align:start position:0%
representative PR talked about it's a
 
00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:16.440 align:start position:0%
chain of events that typically starts
 
00:16:18.829 --> 00:16:18.839 align:start position:0%
with the gradual breakdown of EV battery
 
00:16:22.829 --> 00:16:22.839 align:start position:0%
cells causing preheating of the EV cells
 
00:16:25.389 --> 00:16:25.399 align:start position:0%
and battery pack the elevated
 
00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:27.560 align:start position:0%
temperatures within the EV battery
 
00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:29.560 align:start position:0%
causes the organic solvents to break
 
00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:31.880 align:start position:0%
down resulting in the release of gas
 
00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:33.720 align:start position:0%
increased pressure and temperatures
 
00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
Beyond flash point so it pops and it
 
00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:38.360 align:start position:0%
spreads to all the
 
00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
um all the um materials around it fires
 
00:16:44.189 --> 00:16:44.199 align:start position:0%
and EV batteries are triggered by
 
00:16:47.389 --> 00:16:47.399 align:start position:0%
thermal runaway as a known safety hazard
 
00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:50.440 align:start position:0%
in all lithium ion batteries can be
 
00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
caused by short circuiting mechanical

uh you heard some of the reasons already
 
00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
cold happens yes cold does happen in New
 
00:18:29.149 --> 00:18:29.159 align:start position:0%

00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:35.880 align:start position:0%
I just I did a little search even last
 
00:18:39.149 --> 00:18:39.159 align:start position:0%
night on uh news articles with problems
 
00:18:43.549 --> 00:18:43.559 align:start position:0%

00:19:27.029 --> 00:19:27.039 align:start position:0%
and rainstorm that left hundreds of
 
00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:29.320 align:start position:0%
thousands of people without power and
 
00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:31.360 align:start position:0%
that cause significant flooding and
 
00:19:34.029 --> 00:19:34.039 align:start position:0%
infrastructure damage including town and
 
00:19:34.039 --> 00:19:35.430 align:start position:0%
infrastructure damage including town and
state

00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:35.440 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
roadways now I want to point out that I
 
00:19:41.909 --> 00:19:41.919 align:start position:0%
said rain not snow it's even worse when
 
00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:51.240 align:start position:0%
snow representative golden noted that
 
00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
that week the storm strong would render
 
00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles useless giving the
 
00:19:58.830 --> 00:19:58.840 align:start position:0%
need for Reliable electric generation
 
00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
uh given their need for Reliable El
 
00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:08.909 --> 00:20:08.919 align:start position:0%
supplies the same article noted that
 
00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
Connecticut has abandoned its EV mandate
 
00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:16.440 align:start position:0%
because of various Associated
 
00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
problems uh you saw I think if you have
 
00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:22.880 align:start position:0%
a phone wonderful little memes and
 
00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
pictures of what happened in Chicago uh
 
00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:28.400 align:start position:0%
last week with with the uh with the
 
00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:31.320 align:start position:0%
storm there that left all the Teslas at
 
00:20:33.789 --> 00:20:33.799 align:start position:0%
the charging station and no charging
 
00:20:36.669 --> 00:20:36.679 align:start position:0%
happened and then having to be towed to
 
00:20:36.679 --> 00:20:38.549 align:start position:0%
happened and then having to be towed to
the

00:20:38.549 --> 00:20:38.559 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
dealership Herz just announced rental
 
00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:45.080 align:start position:0%
giant Herz dumps EVS including Teslas
 
00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
for gas
 
00:20:50.549 --> 00:20:50.559 align:start position:0%
cars rental firm Hertz Global Holdings
 
00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:54.480 align:start position:0%
selling about 20,000 EVS including
 
00:20:58.110 --> 00:20:58.120 align:start position:0%
Teslas from a US Fleet about uh 2 years
 
00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:00.360 align:start position:0%
years old after uh a deal with the
 
00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
automaker to offer the vehicles for rent
 
00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:07.240 align:start position:0%
in another sign that EV mandate has
 
00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
cooled what's the reason citing
 
00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
collision and damage for EVS the costs
 
00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
of those uh are much higher than they
 
00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:17.070 align:start position:0%
of those uh are much higher than they
had

00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:17.080 align:start position:0%
had
 
00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:18.630 align:start position:0%
had
expected

00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:18.640 align:start position:0%
expected
 
00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
so that's what's going on particularly
 
00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:25.640 align:start position:0%
around the the northern states um and I
 
00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:28.600 align:start position:0%
want to add another uh area of
 
00:21:31.669 --> 00:21:31.679 align:start position:0%
problems EVS require further building
 
00:21:34.549 --> 00:21:34.559 align:start position:0%
out of our infrastructure and you have
 
00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
heard I think many times that uh New
 
00:21:40.789 --> 00:21:40.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is is Teeters on the edge of
 
00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:43.320 align:start position:0%
blackouts in the winter when we have
 
00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:46.520 align:start position:0%
severe winter storms because winter is
 
00:21:49.909 --> 00:21:49.919 align:start position:0%
one of our electric demand Peaks we also
 
00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:54.360 align:start position:0%
have a a demand peak in the summer but
 
00:21:58.430 --> 00:21:58.440 align:start position:0%
what we're doing when we add EVS to the
 
00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:00.880 align:start position:0%
system is we're adding a larger
 
00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:03.640 align:start position:0%
requirement for electricity to the grid
 
00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:06.400 align:start position:0%
and that requires building out of more
 
00:22:08.549 --> 00:22:08.559 align:start position:0%
trans uh transmission and distribution
 
00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:11.720 align:start position:0%
lines more Transformers and all those
 
00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
costs are paid by all of us as rate
 
00:22:17.789 --> 00:22:17.799 align:start position:0%
payers not the buyers of the EVS but all
 
00:22:19.909 --> 00:22:19.919 align:start position:0%
of us are going to see our electric
 
00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:23.320 align:start position:0%
rates go up further because we need more
 
00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
Transportation more excuse me more
 
00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:26.430 align:start position:0%
Transportation more excuse me more
distribution

00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:26.440 align:start position:0%
distribution
 
00:22:28.669 --> 00:22:28.679 align:start position:0%
lines you heard two of the other
 
00:22:31.149 --> 00:22:31.159 align:start position:0%
speakers discuss the issue of weight a
 
00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:33.440 align:start position:0%
typical EV is about
 
00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:37.480 align:start position:0%
150% of the weight of a of a regular gas
 
00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:40.200 align:start position:0%
driven car that adds more wear and tear
 
00:22:42.909 --> 00:22:42.919 align:start position:0%
to our to our roads and they're not
 
00:22:44.669 --> 00:22:44.679 align:start position:0%
paying the gas
 
00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:46.880 align:start position:0%
tax and I'm not going to go over the
 
00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:49.360 align:start position:0%
safety issues which were well documented
 
00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:52.120 align:start position:0%
by representative Hobson and PR uh so
 
00:22:54.950 --> 00:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
I'll take any questions at this time
 
00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
thank you are
 
00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:58.630 align:start position:0%
thank you are
questions

00:22:58.630 --> 00:22:58.640 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:05.440 align:start position:0%
you John
 
00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
Gage mam chair yes if I could just ask
 
00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:11.240 align:start position:0%
the people who are testifying seem to
 
00:23:13.149 --> 00:23:13.159 align:start position:0%
have prepared documents I'm wondering
 
00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:15.640 align:start position:0%
whether they can hand some of those in
 
00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:17.880 align:start position:0%
for the clerk that would be
 
00:23:24.909 --> 00:23:24.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:27.480 align:start position:0%
please thank you chairwoman uh committee
 
00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:28.590 align:start position:0%
please thank you chairwoman uh committee
members

00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:28.600 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:30.760 align:start position:0%
um you may remember me from last week
 
00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
asking for um a bill that would require
 
00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:36.880 align:start position:0%
the state procurement of transportation
 
00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:38.720 align:start position:0%
and building heating equipment to use
 
00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:42.240 align:start position:0%
proxy carbon pricing um which will tilt
 
00:23:44.789 --> 00:23:44.799 align:start position:0%
the decision making process in favor of
 
00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:48.640 align:start position:0%
EVs and heat pumps um 10 years is a long
 
00:23:50.909 --> 00:23:50.919 align:start position:0%
time as far as technology goes do you
 
00:23:52.269 --> 00:23:52.279 align:start position:0%
remember what your cell phone looked
 
00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
like 10 years ago um we we don't know
 
00:23:56.029 --> 00:23:56.039 align:start position:0%
what EES are going to look like 10 years
 
00:23:59.110 --> 00:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
from now even three years from now
 
00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:02.120 align:start position:0%
I came here in an EV I bought it about a
 
00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:04.960 align:start position:0%
month and a half ago uh it works fine in
 
00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:06.760 align:start position:0%
snow it's allel drive it has a little
 
00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:08.600 align:start position:0%
high clearance it's AIA
 
00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:13.360 align:start position:0%
ev6 um in warm weather 100 280 mil range
 
00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:16.440 align:start position:0%
in cold weather I lose about 20% of that
 
00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
um and that's because heat takes a lot
 
00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:20.600 align:start position:0%
of energy if I don't mind being cold I
 
00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:24.120 align:start position:0%
get better range than that um what the
 
00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
state is lacking is infrastructure for
 
00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
my car um um I drove 200 miles round
 
00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
trip to the White Mountains to do a hike
 
00:24:34.669 --> 00:24:34.679 align:start position:0%
a couple weeks ago and I made it back
 
00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:37.720 align:start position:0%
with 40 mil range left but that's not a
 
00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
good feeling knowing that there's no
 
00:24:41.389 --> 00:24:41.399 align:start position:0%
superchargers north of conquered that I
 
00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:45.080 align:start position:0%
can use so rather than the state using
 
00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
um a mandate not to use EVS I'd like the
 
00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:51.200 align:start position:0%
state to look forward to the the people
 
00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:53.080 align:start position:0%
that are coming from out of state in EVs
 
00:24:55.789 --> 00:24:55.799 align:start position:0%
and and how can we best support them
 
00:24:56.990 --> 00:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
coming here so that they don't have
 
00:24:58.950 --> 00:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
range anxiety thinking New Hampshire is
 
00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:01.320 align:start position:0%
a a dark spot on the map that they dare
 
00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:02.230 align:start position:0%
a a dark spot on the map that they dare
not

00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:02.240 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:06.950 align:start position:0%
not
go

00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:11.120 align:start position:0%
um all costs are paid by the public uh
 
00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi claimed um
 
00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:16.200 align:start position:0%
there's enormous external costs in our
 
00:25:18.269 --> 00:25:18.279 align:start position:0%
using fossil fuels that we are all
 
00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
paying for much more than a slight
 
00:25:24.190 --> 00:25:24.200 align:start position:0%
increase in rates um that could pay for
 
00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
just deploying a good EV charging
 
00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:28.480 align:start position:0%
infrastructure so in conclusion I just
 
00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
hope you will I oppose this bill and I
 
00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:33.480 align:start position:0%
hope you will vote it down um looking
 
00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
forward to what how the state can save
 
00:25:39.149 --> 00:25:39.159 align:start position:0%
money uh EVS are cheaper per mile in
 
00:25:41.230 --> 00:25:41.240 align:start position:0%
total cost of ownership now and they're
 
00:25:44.149 --> 00:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
just going to keep getting better um so
 
00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
please look ahead and plan on electric
 
00:25:49.909 --> 00:25:49.919 align:start position:0%
future for our state um Don't Look Back
 
00:25:51.909 --> 00:25:51.919 align:start position:0%
to the last century and think that we're
 
00:25:55.950 --> 00:25:55.960 align:start position:0%
going to really succeed if we go back um
 
00:25:57.269 --> 00:25:57.279 align:start position:0%
and keep trying to do the same things
 
00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:05.669 --> 00:26:05.679 align:start position:0%
much thank you are there questions
 
00:26:05.679 --> 00:26:06.870 align:start position:0%
much thank you are there questions
represent

00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:06.880 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:09.480 align:start position:0%
Manti thank you madam chair thank you
 
00:26:12.789 --> 00:26:12.799 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
um from your perspective you the
 
00:26:18.909 --> 00:26:18.919 align:start position:0%
technology changes what is the
 
00:26:22.269 --> 00:26:22.279 align:start position:0%
typical period in which the technology
 
00:26:26.389 --> 00:26:26.399 align:start position:0%
advances happen period of 6 months a
 
00:26:29.549 --> 00:26:29.559 align:start position:0%
year two years what is
 
00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:32.320 align:start position:0%
your understanding of Technology thanks
 
00:26:34.669 --> 00:26:34.679 align:start position:0%
I worked in technology for 40 years at
 
00:26:36.789 --> 00:26:36.799 align:start position:0%
Sun Microsystems and an Oracle
 
00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:39.480 align:start position:0%
corporation uh it's hard to predict
 
00:26:41.389 --> 00:26:41.399 align:start position:0%
where the advances are going to come
 
00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
other than advances are going to come
 
00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:45.520 align:start position:0%
but I've read recently Toyota is working
 
00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
on a battery that has 750 miles range
 
00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:51.200 align:start position:0%
it's I think solid state charges really
 
00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
fast um that's going to be here in a
 
00:26:58.230 --> 00:26:58.240 align:start position:0%
couple years right um we we should not
 
00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
do mandates to prevent ourselves from
 
00:27:03.269 --> 00:27:03.279 align:start position:0%
preparing for the future that's a bad
 
00:27:05.950 --> 00:27:05.960 align:start position:0%
idea and most of you don't want mandate
 
00:27:07.909 --> 00:27:07.919 align:start position:0%
so I I would be surprised if you voted
 
00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:10.720 align:start position:0%
for a mandate against looking ahead uh
 
00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
to save the state money um yeah what
 
00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:16.600 align:start position:0%
what is electric vehicle options going
 
00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:18.120 align:start position:0%
to be like well five years ago there
 
00:27:19.669 --> 00:27:19.679 align:start position:0%
were very few options if you wanted an
 
00:27:22.029 --> 00:27:22.039 align:start position:0%
EV and you need to get somewhere you b a
 
00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
Tesla now there's you know a dozen major
 
00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:27.960 align:start position:0%
Mar manufacturers with many models
 
00:27:31.549 --> 00:27:31.559 align:start position:0%
available um and I love my EV it's
 
00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:34.480 align:start position:0%
really a cool car it's it's quiet
 
00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
comfortable um and you feel good because
 
00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:41.200 align:start position:0%
you're polluting a lot less um and you
 
00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
just want charging infrastructure so
 
00:27:46.669 --> 00:27:46.679 align:start position:0%
that you have no worry about where to go
 
00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
charge and I think the state um if it
 
00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:50.720 align:start position:0%
was using electric vehicles it would be
 
00:27:53.909 --> 00:27:53.919 align:start position:0%
motivated to help make that happen Okay
 
00:27:53.919 --> 00:27:55.990 align:start position:0%
motivated to help make that happen Okay
representative

00:27:55.990 --> 00:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:27:58.909 --> 00:27:58.919 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you Madam chair uh good
 
00:28:01.870 --> 00:28:01.880 align:start position:0%
morning uh what are they doing okay so
 
00:28:03.950 --> 00:28:03.960 align:start position:0%
they're getting more charging stations
 
00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
that's good however what are they doing
 
00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:08.320 align:start position:0%
about the batteries themselves are they
 
00:28:10.430 --> 00:28:10.440 align:start position:0%
improving are they working on that so
 
00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
that they don't catch fire what are they
 
00:28:15.269 --> 00:28:15.279 align:start position:0%
doing for the glass around the windows
 
00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
are they making it less or more
 
00:28:21.789 --> 00:28:21.799 align:start position:0%
breakable so that in an accident you can
 
00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:24.760 align:start position:0%
get out or you can also breathe some
 
00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:26.960 align:start position:0%
fresh air what are they doing along
 
00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:28.720 align:start position:0%
those lines
 
00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:30.360 align:start position:0%
yeah there's mechanical ways I mean
 
00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:32.720 align:start position:0%
breaking glass uh there's a a device
 
00:28:35.029 --> 00:28:35.039 align:start position:0%
police have that you just has a really
 
00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:36.640 align:start position:0%
sharp point that will work on a car
 
00:28:39.470 --> 00:28:39.480 align:start position:0%
window anymore but it doesn't work yeah
 
00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:41.200 align:start position:0%
what are they doing to improve it
 
00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:42.760 align:start position:0%
otherwise you're in a box and you're
 
00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:46.760 align:start position:0%
stuck there with that Co that gas coming
 
00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:49.640 align:start position:0%
at you um you know that you got to
 
00:28:52.149 --> 00:28:52.159 align:start position:0%
protect the people driving you do but
 
00:28:53.950 --> 00:28:53.960 align:start position:0%
we're not stopping everybody from buying
 
00:28:56.149 --> 00:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
EVS there there are a lot of EVS on the
 
00:28:58.310 --> 00:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
road and there a lot of EVS coming into
 
00:29:00.789 --> 00:29:00.799 align:start position:0%
State um New Hampshire is not going to
 
00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:03.960 align:start position:0%
prevent EV deployment um this is a a
 
00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
rapidly growing solution to replace
 
00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:10.880 align:start position:0%
fossil fuel powered vehicles um we need
 
00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:13.360 align:start position:0%
to train our police and fire on the
 
00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:16.000 align:start position:0%
different ways of handling EVS versus
 
00:29:17.950 --> 00:29:17.960 align:start position:0%
combustion engines but just as they had
 
00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:21.200 align:start position:0%
to understand how to manage a gasoline
 
00:29:22.750 --> 00:29:22.760 align:start position:0%
Leak with stuff spread all over the
 
00:29:26.269 --> 00:29:26.279 align:start position:0%
ground that that's not safe um there's
 
00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:28.320 align:start position:0%
different ways of being safe with an EV
 
00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:29.880 align:start position:0%
and we should know both of them because
 
00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:32.720 align:start position:0%
we have drivers in the state with both
 
00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:35.360 align:start position:0%
Technologies but 10 years would give a
 
00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:39.080 align:start position:0%
chance for more uh research and trial
 
00:29:42.149 --> 00:29:42.159 align:start position:0%
and error than what we have right now
 
00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:44.840 align:start position:0%
that's all okay thank you for answering
 
00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:48.120 align:start position:0%
was that a question thank you
 
00:29:50.669 --> 00:29:50.679 align:start position:0%
no representative
 
00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
Brown thank you madam chair uh thank you
 
00:29:56.470 --> 00:29:56.480 align:start position:0%
Mr Gage for taking my question G to kind
 
00:29:58.669 --> 00:29:58.679 align:start position:0%
of follow up on what I asked you last
 
00:30:02.389 --> 00:30:02.399 align:start position:0%
week um that Madame chair helped me
 
00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:04.640 align:start position:0%
understand a little bit so I want to be
 
00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:07.200 align:start position:0%
clear from you when you
 
00:30:09.509 --> 00:30:09.519 align:start position:0%
say it's a feel-good that you're not
 
00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
polluting as much and we had the
 
00:30:13.470 --> 00:30:13.480 align:start position:0%
conversation last week that CO2 hasn't
 
00:30:15.549 --> 00:30:15.559 align:start position:0%
been classified as a pollutant
 
00:30:19.389 --> 00:30:19.399 align:start position:0%
so and let's set aside the battery life
 
00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:22.480 align:start position:0%
cycle and development what do you see as
 
00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:25.480 align:start position:0%
you're saving it um
 
00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:28.880 align:start position:0%
as when you say you're driving an EV to
 
00:30:30.789 --> 00:30:30.799 align:start position:0%
be less polluting can you tell me what
 
00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
you mean by that yeah sure well I'm
 
00:30:35.870 --> 00:30:35.880 align:start position:0%
saving money first of all the total cost
 
00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:38.240 align:start position:0%
of ownership of a car miles driven it's
 
00:30:41.230 --> 00:30:41.240 align:start position:0%
less than an EV and you know I got mine
 
00:30:44.789 --> 00:30:44.799 align:start position:0%
Green Wave EV uh one-year-old model so I
 
00:30:48.990 --> 00:30:49.000 align:start position:0%
saved some money that way U but as far
 
00:30:52.470 --> 00:30:52.480 align:start position:0%
as um carbon dioxide being a pollutant
 
00:30:54.789 --> 00:30:54.799 align:start position:0%
um we have a state climate scientist Dr
 
00:30:56.669 --> 00:30:56.679 align:start position:0%
Mary stampone of University of New
 
00:30:59.029 --> 00:30:59.039 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and she is far more qualified
 
00:31:01.629 --> 00:31:01.639 align:start position:0%
than I am to explain to you what we are
 
00:31:04.909 --> 00:31:04.919 align:start position:0%
doing at a from a expert level I've read
 
00:31:07.909 --> 00:31:07.919 align:start position:0%
a lot of reports from uh the United
 
00:31:09.629 --> 00:31:09.639 align:start position:0%
States Global change research program
 
00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:12.120 align:start position:0%
the international government um panel on
 
00:31:15.509 --> 00:31:15.519 align:start position:0%
climate change and out of the 200
 
00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:17.240 align:start position:0%
scientific organizations that I know
 
00:31:18.669 --> 00:31:18.679 align:start position:0%
about none of them dispute the
 
00:31:21.070 --> 00:31:21.080 align:start position:0%
scientific consensus that carbon dioxide
 
00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:23.200 align:start position:0%
from burning fossil fuels is changing
 
00:31:27.269 --> 00:31:27.279 align:start position:0%
the physical and chemical nature of our
 
00:31:30.149 --> 00:31:30.159 align:start position:0%
air land and water in ways that cost us
 
00:31:33.149 --> 00:31:33.159 align:start position:0%
greatly um I think the EPA did rule that
 
00:31:38.269 --> 00:31:38.279 align:start position:0%
CO2 is pollution um the a more recent
 
00:31:40.789 --> 00:31:40.799 align:start position:0%
ruling okay thank
 
00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:43.200 align:start position:0%
you thank you for your
 
00:31:56.149 --> 00:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:56.159 --> 00:32:01.389 align:start position:0%
 
Fitzgerald

00:32:01.389 --> 00:32:01.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:03.389 --> 00:32:03.399 align:start position:0%
morning Madam chair and members of the
 
00:32:06.549 --> 00:32:06.559 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Mike Fitzgerald um
 
00:32:08.750 --> 00:32:08.760 align:start position:0%
I am the assistant director of the air
 
00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:10.360 align:start position:0%
Resources Division at the Department of
 
00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services uh we take no
 
00:32:14.830 --> 00:32:14.840 align:start position:0%
particular position on this bill um
 
00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
there are numerous bills related to
 
00:32:18.590 --> 00:32:18.600 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles as a matter of fact
 
00:32:20.269 --> 00:32:20.279 align:start position:0%
you have another one come being heard
 
00:32:23.110 --> 00:32:23.120 align:start position:0%
this morning um what I just wanted to
 
00:32:24.789 --> 00:32:24.799 align:start position:0%
bring to your attention is that there
 
00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
are currently uh two bills that would
 
00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:30.320 align:start position:0%
create study commissions uh one in the
 
00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:33.440 align:start position:0%
house and one in the Senate s sp430 and
 
00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:34.669 align:start position:0%
house and one in the Senate s sp430 and
HB

00:32:34.669 --> 00:32:34.679 align:start position:0%
HB
 
00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:40.200 align:start position:0%
1510 these two uh uh commissions would
 
00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
uh propose to study uh barriers to
 
00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle entry into the markets
 
00:32:49.350 --> 00:32:49.360 align:start position:0%
and also uh issues such as these fires
 
00:32:52.110 --> 00:32:52.120 align:start position:0%
and so on last week at the Senate Bill
 
00:32:55.870 --> 00:32:55.880 align:start position:0%
430 uh uh study commission Bill hearing
 
00:32:58.110 --> 00:32:58.120 align:start position:0%
the State Fire Marshall was asked about
 
00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:00.600 align:start position:0%
the number of fires and his indication
 
00:33:02.470 --> 00:33:02.480 align:start position:0%
at that time was that to the best of his
 
00:33:04.590 --> 00:33:04.600 align:start position:0%
knowledge and the data that he had
 
00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:06.600 align:start position:0%
access to here in the state that um
 
00:33:11.029 --> 00:33:11.039 align:start position:0%
we've had two EV fires um the uh uh we
 
00:33:14.830 --> 00:33:14.840 align:start position:0%
have approximately 10 um at least 12,000
 
00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:20.240 align:start position:0%
EVS currently operating on the the uh
 
00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:23.480 align:start position:0%
uh cities and streets of U of New
 
00:33:27.190 --> 00:33:27.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so um but again uh the these
 
00:33:30.590 --> 00:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
two commissions would uh uh we think
 
00:33:32.789 --> 00:33:32.799 align:start position:0%
would be good uh Vehicles no pun
 
00:33:37.990 --> 00:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
intended for uh uh the uh study of some
 
00:33:40.509 --> 00:33:40.519 align:start position:0%
of the issues that have been raised here
 
00:33:43.549 --> 00:33:43.559 align:start position:0%
um we do think and the fire marshal uh I
 
00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
know agrees that um there there are some
 
00:33:48.389 --> 00:33:48.399 align:start position:0%
safety issues and they need they need to
 
00:33:50.389 --> 00:33:50.399 align:start position:0%
be looked at proper training as was
 
00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:54.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned by Mr Gage um so on uh you
 
00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:57.480 align:start position:0%
know the these these when we need to
 
00:33:59.470 --> 00:33:59.480 align:start position:0%
look at the real data um get the
 
00:34:02.310 --> 00:34:02.320 align:start position:0%
information and uh and and then make
 
00:34:04.029 --> 00:34:04.039 align:start position:0%
decisions and both of these committees
 
00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:08.280 align:start position:0%
would proposed to do that so um we would
 
00:34:10.430 --> 00:34:10.440 align:start position:0%
suggest that the committee at least
 
00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
consider um uh holding these bills for
 
00:34:16.430 --> 00:34:16.440 align:start position:0%
interim study until these Comm whether
 
00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:18.240 align:start position:0%
there's a decision made to to create
 
00:34:22.149 --> 00:34:22.159 align:start position:0%
these commissions and uh um and allow
 
00:34:24.829 --> 00:34:24.839 align:start position:0%
them to do some some work getting uh
 
00:34:27.270 --> 00:34:27.280 align:start position:0%
good accurate information and providing
 
00:34:29.389 --> 00:34:29.399 align:start position:0%
that to the legislature and making any
 
00:34:32.430 --> 00:34:32.440 align:start position:0%
recommendations for legislation we do
 
00:34:35.669 --> 00:34:35.679 align:start position:0%
convene at Dees in or a group of state
 
00:34:39.149 --> 00:34:39.159 align:start position:0%
agencies that have uh interests in uh
 
00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles this is a tourism
 
00:34:44.270 --> 00:34:44.280 align:start position:0%
issue as well State of New Hampshire uh
 
00:34:48.109 --> 00:34:48.119 align:start position:0%
as was noted does have um a lack of
 
00:34:51.149 --> 00:34:51.159 align:start position:0%
infrastructure for electric vehicles um
 
00:34:53.149 --> 00:34:53.159 align:start position:0%
we we administer the Volkswagen
 
00:34:56.349 --> 00:34:56.359 align:start position:0%
mitigation trust that um was created
 
00:34:58.310 --> 00:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
several years years ago that supplies
 
00:35:00.030 --> 00:35:00.040 align:start position:0%
$30 million to the state of New
 
00:35:02.910 --> 00:35:02.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to um mitigate the the issues
 
00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
associated with the Volkswagen cheating
 
00:35:09.870 --> 00:35:09.880 align:start position:0%
scandal and um the governor did allow uh
 
00:35:13.510 --> 00:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
us and and directed us to uh uh set
 
00:35:17.109 --> 00:35:17.119 align:start position:0%
aside the maximum of 15% of that uh $30
 
00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
million to uh use for um electric
 
00:35:24.870 --> 00:35:24.880 align:start position:0%
vehicle infrastructure Etc noting that
 
00:35:27.670 --> 00:35:27.680 align:start position:0%
you know we need we needed to do this um
 
00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
several agencies are involved in in um
 
00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:33.560 align:start position:0%
this group that we facilitate and there
 
00:35:34.990 --> 00:35:35.000 align:start position:0%
are a number of agencies that are
 
00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:37.560 align:start position:0%
promoting and I know some are here today
 
00:35:40.750 --> 00:35:40.760 align:start position:0%
um to uh uh to possibly to discuss their
 
00:35:42.829 --> 00:35:42.839 align:start position:0%
efforts in in getting additional EV
 
00:35:45.470 --> 00:35:45.480 align:start position:0%
infrastructure here in the state um if
 
00:35:48.069 --> 00:35:48.079 align:start position:0%
you look at a map of EV charging in New
 
00:35:50.349 --> 00:35:50.359 align:start position:0%
England um where the hole in the donnut
 
00:35:53.550 --> 00:35:53.560 align:start position:0%
there's there's a lot of uh EV charging
 
00:35:57.150 --> 00:35:57.160 align:start position:0%
in uh all the states around us um and
 
00:35:59.990 --> 00:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
we're trying to to uh uh to work to
 
00:36:03.069 --> 00:36:03.079 align:start position:0%
catch up on that so um with that I'd be
 
00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
happy to take uh questions I also have
 
00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
with me today Jessica Wilcox who's in
 
00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:10.720 align:start position:0%
charge of our motor uh vehicle emissions
 
00:36:14.030 --> 00:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
programs and uh our efforts and the VW
 
00:36:16.750 --> 00:36:16.760 align:start position:0%
trust um so if you have questions about
 
00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
any of that um I might ask her to join
 
00:36:22.470 --> 00:36:22.480 align:start position:0%
me and and uh provide some information
 
00:36:24.910 --> 00:36:24.920 align:start position:0%
but I'll do the best I can if if there
 
00:36:27.230 --> 00:36:27.240 align:start position:0%
there are questions thank you for your
 
00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:29.680 align:start position:0%
attention I would like you to repeat the
 
00:36:33.550 --> 00:36:33.560 align:start position:0%
numbers of those two bills SB
 
00:36:37.309 --> 00:36:37.319 align:start position:0%
430 and HB 1510
 
00:36:40.790 --> 00:36:40.800 align:start position:0%
1510 yes thank you very much are there
 
00:36:43.790 --> 00:36:43.800 align:start position:0%
any questions representative Benjy thank
 
00:36:46.670 --> 00:36:46.680 align:start position:0%
you madam chair um thank you for taking
 
00:36:51.510 --> 00:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
my question um you talked about uh two
 
00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:54.400 align:start position:0%
vehicles EV Vehicles catching on fire do
 
00:36:57.630 --> 00:36:57.640 align:start position:0%
you have any statistics for
 
00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:02.480 align:start position:0%
um gas vehicle the number of on the road
 
00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:04.309 align:start position:0%
um gas vehicle the number of on the road
um

00:37:04.309 --> 00:37:04.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:07.200 align:start position:0%
and representative manuti he reported
 
00:37:09.589 --> 00:37:09.599 align:start position:0%
that as secondhand from the fire
 
00:37:13.069 --> 00:37:13.079 align:start position:0%
marshal so he may not have that in May
 
00:37:15.790 --> 00:37:15.800 align:start position:0%
well not have that information available
 
00:37:18.109 --> 00:37:18.119 align:start position:0%
can I ask a different question please
 
00:37:21.309 --> 00:37:21.319 align:start position:0%
thank you so how are our neighboring
 
00:37:24.190 --> 00:37:24.200 align:start position:0%
states addressing the safety with the
 
00:37:26.829 --> 00:37:26.839 align:start position:0%
eveve you mentioned this is a donnut ho
 
00:37:29.710 --> 00:37:29.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is a donut hold well my my
 
00:37:31.589 --> 00:37:31.599 align:start position:0%
reference there was in terms of EV
 
00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:34.160 align:start position:0%
infrastructure charging infrastructure
 
00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:36.520 align:start position:0%
um uh I I know the Fire Marshall has
 
00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:40.240 align:start position:0%
been in touch with uh a number of his uh
 
00:37:42.270 --> 00:37:42.280 align:start position:0%
uh cohorts in in in other states
 
00:37:45.630 --> 00:37:45.640 align:start position:0%
relative to the safety issues um I can't
 
00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:47.680 align:start position:0%
again I would not want to testify on his
 
00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
behalf I just wanted to mention that
 
00:37:51.870 --> 00:37:51.880 align:start position:0%
anecdotally that um because the question
 
00:37:55.790 --> 00:37:55.800 align:start position:0%
was asked um and uh I I would certainly
 
00:37:58.349 --> 00:37:58.359 align:start position:0%
recommend that um you reach out I I will
 
00:38:01.109 --> 00:38:01.119 align:start position:0%
speak to him and and let him know but uh
 
00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:02.800 align:start position:0%
uh what the other states are doing I'm
 
00:38:04.589 --> 00:38:04.599 align:start position:0%
I'm unaware of any other states
 
00:38:08.950 --> 00:38:08.960 align:start position:0%
proposing uh moratoriums um at least in
 
00:38:11.870 --> 00:38:11.880 align:start position:0%
in the Northeast but um I certainly
 
00:38:14.430 --> 00:38:14.440 align:start position:0%
would not you know I'd want to research
 
00:38:16.069 --> 00:38:16.079 align:start position:0%
that and get back to you on
 
00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
it thank you other
 
00:38:21.870 --> 00:38:21.880 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much thank
 
00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:34.950 align:start position:0%

David Rodriguez please speak in the
 
00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:44.480 align:start position:0%
microphone thank you sorry about that
 
00:38:46.309 --> 00:38:46.319 align:start position:0%
good morning for the record my name is

Hampshire Department of
 
00:38:53.870 --> 00:38:53.880 align:start position:0%
Transportation thank you for hearing my
 
00:38:57.470 --> 00:38:57.480 align:start position:0%
testimony on HB 1333
 
00:38:59.750 --> 00:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
the department does not support or
 
00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
oppose a bill however we do have some
 
00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
concerns and a suggestion the department
 
00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
understands that like many new
 
00:39:09.790 --> 00:39:09.800 align:start position:0%
technologies there are challenges and
 
00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
complexities with the growth of electric
 
00:39:15.349 --> 00:39:15.359 align:start position:0%
vehicles not the least of which include
 
00:39:18.309 --> 00:39:18.319 align:start position:0%
cost of the vehicles cost construction
 
00:39:19.829 --> 00:39:19.839 align:start position:0%
and maintenance of charging
 
00:39:22.069 --> 00:39:22.079 align:start position:0%
infrastructure for the individual for
 
00:39:25.670 --> 00:39:25.680 align:start position:0%
the public and for for vehicle fleets
 
00:39:28.349 --> 00:39:28.359 align:start position:0%
limitations to our electricity Supply
 
00:39:31.150 --> 00:39:31.160 align:start position:0%
and distribution limitations to
 
00:39:33.589 --> 00:39:33.599 align:start position:0%

vehicles that do not contribute to the
 
00:40:04.030 --> 00:40:04.040 align:start position:0%
road toll or fuel tax the department
 
00:40:05.990 --> 00:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
also understands that while these
 
00:40:08.910 --> 00:40:08.920 align:start position:0%
challenges and complexities are
 
00:40:11.390 --> 00:40:11.400 align:start position:0%
difficult and real they will be worked
 
00:40:15.109 --> 00:40:15.119 align:start position:0%
out in time as the technology develops
 
00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
from a DOT Fleet perspective the
 
00:40:20.950 --> 00:40:20.960 align:start position:0%
department Fleet includes over 1,250
 
00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
pieces at a replacement cost exceeding
 
00:40:28.190 --> 00:40:28.200 align:start position:0%
$120 million the we contains 71
 
00:40:31.950 --> 00:40:31.960 align:start position:0%
passenger Autos 146 light duty trucks
 
00:40:37.190 --> 00:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
SUVs and vans and 163 3/4 ton trucks the
 
00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:40.480 align:start position:0%
department currently owns zero electric
 
00:40:43.710 --> 00:40:43.720 align:start position:0%
vehicles as we consider adding electric
 
00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
vehicles to our Fleet our number one
 
00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
concern is what job function can use the
 
00:40:51.829 --> 00:40:51.839 align:start position:0%
vehicle efficiently and effectively and
 
00:40:55.190 --> 00:40:55.200 align:start position:0%
how will we charge the vehicle we next
 
00:40:57.550 --> 00:40:57.560 align:start position:0%
consider short-term long-term cost
 
00:40:59.870 --> 00:40:59.880 align:start position:0%
maintenance and function to date our
 
00:41:03.230 --> 00:41:03.240 align:start position:0%
analysis has not identified an efficient
 
00:41:05.910 --> 00:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
effective electric vehicle for our Fleet
 
00:41:08.550 --> 00:41:08.560 align:start position:0%
range cold weather performance cost the
 
00:41:11.670 --> 00:41:11.680 align:start position:0%
ability to reassign the vehicle to other
 
00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
functions in the department charging
 
00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:16.440 align:start position:0%
infrastructure as well as maintenance
 
00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:18.560 align:start position:0%
technician training and tooling have
 
00:41:20.910 --> 00:41:20.920 align:start position:0%
prevented us from finding a positive
 
00:41:23.550 --> 00:41:23.560 align:start position:0%
cost benefit ratio that would lead to
 
00:41:26.910 --> 00:41:26.920 align:start position:0%
our purchase of electric vehicles
 
00:41:29.069 --> 00:41:29.079 align:start position:0%
however the department includes many
 
00:41:31.349 --> 00:41:31.359 align:start position:0%
professionals committed to providing the
 
00:41:34.270 --> 00:41:34.280 align:start position:0%
best transportation system at the best
 
00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:36.400 align:start position:0%
cost for the citizens of New Hampshire
 
00:41:39.109 --> 00:41:39.119 align:start position:0%
and our visitors we need many different
 
00:41:41.710 --> 00:41:41.720 align:start position:0%
skilled people Technologies equipment
 
00:41:44.670 --> 00:41:44.680 align:start position:0%
tools and material to do that work we
 
00:41:46.870 --> 00:41:46.880 align:start position:0%
analyze the complexities of every
 
00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
decision point when it comes to
 
00:41:51.470 --> 00:41:51.480 align:start position:0%
providing this system and we follow the
 
00:41:54.349 --> 00:41:54.359 align:start position:0%
laws of our state even those laws that
 
00:41:56.230 --> 00:41:56.240 align:start position:0%
do not lead us to the best trans
 
00:41:59.309 --> 00:41:59.319 align:start position:0%
transportation system at the best cost
 
00:42:01.710 --> 00:42:01.720 align:start position:0%
while we have zero electric vehicles
 
00:42:04.670 --> 00:42:04.680 align:start position:0%
today we are concerned that a law which
 
00:42:07.309 --> 00:42:07.319 align:start position:0%
prohibits us from purchasing or leasing
 
00:42:10.750 --> 00:42:10.760 align:start position:0%
any electric vehicles for 10 years May
 
00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
in the end Force us to make Fleet
 
00:42:15.790 --> 00:42:15.800 align:start position:0%
decisions that do not lead to the best
 
00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:18.720 align:start position:0%
transportation system at the best cost
 
00:42:21.390 --> 00:42:21.400 align:start position:0%
for our citizens the department would
 
00:42:24.270 --> 00:42:24.280 align:start position:0%
like to highlight the final report of
 
00:42:26.309 --> 00:42:26.319 align:start position:0%
the electric vehicle charging state
 
00:42:28.750 --> 00:42:28.760 align:start position:0%
ations infrastructure commission
 
00:42:33.549 --> 00:42:33.559 align:start position:0%
established under SP 517 in 2018 the
 
00:42:35.630 --> 00:42:35.640 align:start position:0%
commission suggested using the
 
00:42:37.510 --> 00:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
transportation Council that's
 
00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
established under RSA 238 A2 as a body
 
00:42:44.790 --> 00:42:44.800 align:start position:0%
best suited to continue their work the
 
00:42:47.470 --> 00:42:47.480 align:start position:0%
department suggests that this bill and
 
00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
others addressing the complex issues
 
00:42:52.270 --> 00:42:52.280 align:start position:0%
coming from electric vehicles be
 
00:42:54.589 --> 00:42:54.599 align:start position:0%
referred to the transportation Council
 
00:42:57.109 --> 00:42:57.119 align:start position:0%
for investigation with recommendations
 
00:42:59.870 --> 00:42:59.880 align:start position:0%
coming back to the general court the New
 
00:43:01.950 --> 00:43:01.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Transportation Council was
 
00:43:04.910 --> 00:43:04.920 align:start position:0%
established by the legislature to look
 
00:43:06.030 --> 00:43:06.040 align:start position:0%
at new
 
00:43:08.790 --> 00:43:08.800 align:start position:0%
Transportation Technologies and modes
 
00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
such as electric vehicles given the
 
00:43:13.910 --> 00:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
number of EV related bills filed a
 
00:43:16.510 --> 00:43:16.520 align:start position:0%
session and the related various complex
 
00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
issue the council is a good resource for
 
00:43:23.510 --> 00:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
the legisl to use to look at those bills
 
00:43:25.390 --> 00:43:25.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for hearing my testimony and
 
00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:28.200 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to answer any questions
 
00:43:29.750 --> 00:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
thank you we would like to have a copy
 
00:43:32.069 --> 00:43:32.079 align:start position:0%
of your uh your testimony thank you that
 
00:43:34.630 --> 00:43:34.640 align:start position:0%
would be helpful representative leus
 
00:43:36.750 --> 00:43:36.760 align:start position:0%
thank you um seem to imply that there
 
00:43:38.670 --> 00:43:38.680 align:start position:0%
might be existing statutes that prevent
 
00:43:40.950 --> 00:43:40.960 align:start position:0%
the department from buying what would be
 
00:43:42.630 --> 00:43:42.640 align:start position:0%
the best vehicles for the state if there
 
00:43:44.790 --> 00:43:44.800 align:start position:0%
are such could you please send a list of
 
00:43:46.270 --> 00:43:46.280 align:start position:0%
those to the
 
00:43:49.349 --> 00:43:49.359 align:start position:0%
committee sure basically they are our
 
00:43:52.270 --> 00:43:52.280 align:start position:0%
procurement standards which require us
 
00:43:55.390 --> 00:43:55.400 align:start position:0%
to to do low bid and make it very
 
00:43:58.630 --> 00:43:58.640 align:start position:0%
difficult for us to do a best life life
 
00:44:02.589 --> 00:44:02.599 align:start position:0%
cycle cost uh analysis in the overhead
 
00:44:05.270 --> 00:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
that's that's required to go through
 
00:44:07.549 --> 00:44:07.559 align:start position:0%
those processes okay thank you okay
 
00:44:11.230 --> 00:44:11.240 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions representative
 
00:44:13.630 --> 00:44:13.640 align:start position:0%
Schmidt I I'm sure you're thinking in
 
00:44:15.430 --> 00:44:15.440 align:start position:0%
the same direction that several of us
 
00:44:17.990 --> 00:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
are that uh some of the issues
 
00:44:20.510 --> 00:44:20.520 align:start position:0%
especially that the commissioner is uh
 
00:44:23.990 --> 00:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
raising suggest that uh this may need to
 
00:44:26.430 --> 00:44:26.440 align:start position:0%
go to subcommittee have you decided that
 
00:44:29.230 --> 00:44:29.240 align:start position:0%
yet no but I know that if it does it
 
00:44:31.870 --> 00:44:31.880 align:start position:0%
will go to the representative Shu
 
00:44:34.670 --> 00:44:34.680 align:start position:0%
subcommittee thank
 
00:44:38.270 --> 00:44:38.280 align:start position:0%
you okay other
 
00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:58.270 align:start position:0%
 
Fredericks

00:44:58.270 --> 00:44:58.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:00.670 --> 00:45:00.680 align:start position:0%
good morning and thank you uh my name is
 
00:45:04.390 --> 00:45:04.400 align:start position:0%
m friedricks um and I am with 350 New
 
00:45:06.150 --> 00:45:06.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire action but I am also an
 
00:45:08.549 --> 00:45:08.559 align:start position:0%
elected official in Durham and I will
 
00:45:11.790 --> 00:45:11.800 align:start position:0%
speak mainly um from my experience there
 
00:45:15.069 --> 00:45:15.079 align:start position:0%
um there are a number of issues in this
 
00:45:18.230 --> 00:45:18.240 align:start position:0%
bill um that raised a lot of concern in
 
00:45:21.390 --> 00:45:21.400 align:start position:0%
terms of its um preparedness for being
 
00:45:24.230 --> 00:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
considered um one is that um when we
 
00:45:27.790 --> 00:45:27.800 align:start position:0%
look at line five includes um any hybrid
 
00:45:30.430 --> 00:45:30.440 align:start position:0%
vehicles hybrid vehicles do not connect
 
00:45:32.710 --> 00:45:32.720 align:start position:0%
to the electric grid uh plug-in hybrid
 
00:45:35.190 --> 00:45:35.200 align:start position:0%
vehicles do hybrid vehicles are a
 
00:45:36.750 --> 00:45:36.760 align:start position:0%
technology that have been around since
 
00:45:39.549 --> 00:45:39.559 align:start position:0%
the early 2000s um in fact the car I
 
00:45:43.309 --> 00:45:43.319 align:start position:0%
drove in this morning is a 2007 Hybrid
 
00:45:45.150 --> 00:45:45.160 align:start position:0%
uh it does not connect to the electric
 
00:45:48.829 --> 00:45:48.839 align:start position:0%
grid um and the concern from a a a town
 
00:45:50.549 --> 00:45:50.559 align:start position:0%
standpoint extends to really what it
 
00:45:53.470 --> 00:45:53.480 align:start position:0%
means to be a taxpayer in this state so
 
00:45:55.309 --> 00:45:55.319 align:start position:0%
um the town of Durham has been using
 
00:45:58.549 --> 00:45:58.559 align:start position:0%
hybrid vehicles within its Town Fleet um
 
00:46:01.990 --> 00:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
for more than 10 years at this point um
 
00:46:03.870 --> 00:46:03.880 align:start position:0%
the cost savings have been so
 
00:46:06.430 --> 00:46:06.440 align:start position:0%
significant that we have managed to um
 
00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
expand considerably the number of town
 
00:46:10.870 --> 00:46:10.880 align:start position:0%
vehicles and how frequently we are able
 
00:46:14.030 --> 00:46:14.040 align:start position:0%
to replace those Vehicles while keeping
 
00:46:16.950 --> 00:46:16.960 align:start position:0%
the town budget flat um and the tax rate
 
00:46:19.710 --> 00:46:19.720 align:start position:0%
flat for the last seven or eight years I
 
00:46:21.069 --> 00:46:21.079 align:start position:0%
don't know how many towns in New
 
00:46:23.390 --> 00:46:23.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire can say the same thing so
 
00:46:25.230 --> 00:46:25.240 align:start position:0%
there have been significant cost savings
 
00:46:28.870 --> 00:46:28.880 align:start position:0%
to the town by adopting um you know
 
00:46:31.309 --> 00:46:31.319 align:start position:0%
adopting um hybrid vehicles and we are
 
00:46:32.990 --> 00:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
now starting to incorporate electric
 
00:46:35.190 --> 00:46:35.200 align:start position:0%
vehicles into the town Fleet for the
 
00:46:37.670 --> 00:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
same reason um we obviously vet that
 
00:46:39.870 --> 00:46:39.880 align:start position:0%
through our fire department first and
 
00:46:42.069 --> 00:46:42.079 align:start position:0%
there are occasions where it's been
 
00:46:44.430 --> 00:46:44.440 align:start position:0%
determined that it's not appropriate um
 
00:46:46.950 --> 00:46:46.960 align:start position:0%
because the technology isn't there yet
 
00:46:49.430 --> 00:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
um but the State Fire Marshall has
 
00:46:52.710 --> 00:46:52.720 align:start position:0%
testified that EVs do not represent um
 
00:46:55.430 --> 00:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
are are not more likely to catch fire um
 
00:46:58.349 --> 00:46:58.359 align:start position:0%
I myself have seen data suggesting that
 
00:47:01.470 --> 00:47:01.480 align:start position:0%
um that uh EVS are actually less likely
 
00:47:03.470 --> 00:47:03.480 align:start position:0%
to catch fire than traditional internal
 
00:47:06.549 --> 00:47:06.559 align:start position:0%
combus combustion vehicles um so I I
 
00:47:08.030 --> 00:47:08.040 align:start position:0%
hope that the committee would look into
 
00:47:11.430 --> 00:47:11.440 align:start position:0%
that research further um of course EV as
 
00:47:14.510 --> 00:47:14.520 align:start position:0%
um they do burn hotter um and so there
 
00:47:16.349 --> 00:47:16.359 align:start position:0%
are some concerns about whether that
 
00:47:17.950 --> 00:47:17.960 align:start position:0%
would take fire departments who are
 
00:47:20.270 --> 00:47:20.280 align:start position:0%
unprepared or untrained longer to put
 
00:47:22.470 --> 00:47:22.480 align:start position:0%
out those fires but that's where I think
 
00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:24.400 align:start position:0%
that proper training is up utmost
 
00:47:27.270 --> 00:47:27.280 align:start position:0%
important um we had do that throughout
 
00:47:28.990 --> 00:47:29.000 align:start position:0%
you know our history as a state as the
 
00:47:30.790 --> 00:47:30.800 align:start position:0%
state Incorporated new technologies when
 
00:47:32.829 --> 00:47:32.839 align:start position:0%
we added natural gas systems when we
 
00:47:36.750 --> 00:47:36.760 align:start position:0%
started using petroleum gas um we have
 
00:47:38.630 --> 00:47:38.640 align:start position:0%
systems in place to deal with natural
 
00:47:41.030 --> 00:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
gas leaks uh we have training for our
 
00:47:43.630 --> 00:47:43.640 align:start position:0%
officials and the same with um petroleum
 
00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:46.640 align:start position:0%
fires like the major six alarm fire that
 
00:47:48.510 --> 00:47:48.520 align:start position:0%
occurred in eping last week which was a
 
00:47:51.109 --> 00:47:51.119 align:start position:0%
petroleum spill coming from internal
 
00:47:54.190 --> 00:47:54.200 align:start position:0%
combustion engine vehicles um so there
 
00:47:55.950 --> 00:47:55.960 align:start position:0%
are serious cost savings to to the
 
00:47:58.589 --> 00:47:58.599 align:start position:0%
taxpayers of New Hampshire that may be
 
00:48:01.630 --> 00:48:01.640 align:start position:0%
available by adopting um these types of
 
00:48:04.549 --> 00:48:04.559 align:start position:0%
Technologies um and carbon pollution um
 
00:48:06.470 --> 00:48:06.480 align:start position:0%
has been established as a pollution by
 
00:48:08.549 --> 00:48:08.559 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire um in this
 
00:48:10.910 --> 00:48:10.920 align:start position:0%
past year because the state has accepted
 
00:48:14.470 --> 00:48:14.480 align:start position:0%
um funding to do um several different
 
00:48:17.549 --> 00:48:17.559 align:start position:0%
initiatives that specifically uh their
 
00:48:19.870 --> 00:48:19.880 align:start position:0%
their goal and this is through um some
 
00:48:23.829 --> 00:48:23.839 align:start position:0%
of the the um well the inflation
 
00:48:26.190 --> 00:48:26.200 align:start position:0%
reduction act funding for our CL action
 
00:48:27.589 --> 00:48:27.599 align:start position:0%
plan which our governor and our
 
00:48:29.790 --> 00:48:29.800 align:start position:0%
executive Council decided to support and
 
00:48:32.790 --> 00:48:32.800 align:start position:0%
accept um but also the um Volkswagen
 
00:48:35.870 --> 00:48:35.880 align:start position:0%
fund specifically the the details of
 
00:48:38.270 --> 00:48:38.280 align:start position:0%
those funds name that the goal of those
 
00:48:40.510 --> 00:48:40.520 align:start position:0%
expenditures has to be to reduce carbon
 
00:48:42.870 --> 00:48:42.880 align:start position:0%
pollution um so carbon pollution in
 
00:48:45.150 --> 00:48:45.160 align:start position:0%
practice has been uh accepted as a
 
00:48:48.470 --> 00:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
pollution within our state um and thank
 
00:48:50.150 --> 00:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
you very much for for hearing my
 
00:48:51.829 --> 00:48:51.839 align:start position:0%
testimony and happy to accept any
 
00:48:54.589 --> 00:48:54.599 align:start position:0%
questions if there are
 
00:48:54.599 --> 00:48:56.510 align:start position:0%
questions if there are
any

00:48:56.510 --> 00:48:56.520 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:48:59.270 --> 00:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
beny thank you madam chair thank you for
 
00:49:02.950 --> 00:49:02.960 align:start position:0%
taking my question um how is the need
 
00:49:07.710 --> 00:49:07.720 align:start position:0%
for Ev or hybrid plug-in hybrid from the
 
00:49:09.829 --> 00:49:09.839 align:start position:0%
student body because Durham has the
 
00:49:13.670 --> 00:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
large student body is there a big
 
00:49:16.789 --> 00:49:16.799 align:start position:0%
request coming from out of state
 
00:49:20.309 --> 00:49:20.319 align:start position:0%
students um so uh and I apologize I
 
00:49:22.270 --> 00:49:22.280 align:start position:0%
can't speak into the microphone and
 
00:49:25.030 --> 00:49:25.040 align:start position:0%
easily see you but um I would say that
 
00:49:27.190 --> 00:49:27.200 align:start position:0%
at this point point no there's not been
 
00:49:30.190 --> 00:49:30.200 align:start position:0%
um a large adoption by students of using
 
00:49:32.630 --> 00:49:32.640 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles um we are seeing it
 
00:49:34.549 --> 00:49:34.559 align:start position:0%
more from their family members that come
 
00:49:36.870 --> 00:49:36.880 align:start position:0%
to visit or the University of New
 
00:49:39.030 --> 00:49:39.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire obviously receives a lot of
 
00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
visitors and so um the town at this
 
00:49:45.750 --> 00:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
point we have four town-owned um uh EV
 
00:49:48.510 --> 00:49:48.520 align:start position:0%
Chargers and we have at least another
 
00:49:50.470 --> 00:49:50.480 align:start position:0%
two that are operated by private
 
00:49:52.910 --> 00:49:52.920 align:start position:0%
businesses um we have seen an increase
 
00:49:55.950 --> 00:49:55.960 align:start position:0%
from just in the past year of 300 %
 
00:49:57.789 --> 00:49:57.799 align:start position:0%
increase in the demand for the use of
 
00:50:01.069 --> 00:50:01.079 align:start position:0%
those Chargers um and we're not able to
 
00:50:03.630 --> 00:50:03.640 align:start position:0%
know though um whether that is coming
 
00:50:05.430 --> 00:50:05.440 align:start position:0%
you know entirely locally or from out of
 
00:50:07.829 --> 00:50:07.839 align:start position:0%
state but we are seeing an increased
 
00:50:11.470 --> 00:50:11.480 align:start position:0%
demand um so I we do anticipate that the
 
00:50:14.069 --> 00:50:14.079 align:start position:0%
demand will grow and that also um you
 
00:50:17.589 --> 00:50:17.599 align:start position:0%
know UNH uh is looking at various
 
00:50:19.670 --> 00:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
different um Technologies for its
 
00:50:21.829 --> 00:50:21.839 align:start position:0%
vehicle Fleet um they share some of that
 
00:50:24.069 --> 00:50:24.079 align:start position:0%
information with us and Durham you know
 
00:50:26.030 --> 00:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
we continue to go by what is most cost
 
00:50:29.990 --> 00:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
effective for the town um and and that
 
00:50:32.510 --> 00:50:32.520 align:start position:0%
has been now for over a decade to go
 
00:50:34.190 --> 00:50:34.200 align:start position:0%
hybrid wherever possible and now we're
 
00:50:38.510 --> 00:50:38.520 align:start position:0%
starting to incorporate EV vehicles or
 
00:50:40.750 --> 00:50:40.760 align:start position:0%
EVS thank
 
00:50:43.069 --> 00:50:43.079 align:start position:0%
you all right thank you for your
 
00:50:45.190 --> 00:50:45.200 align:start position:0%
testimony is there anyone else who
 
00:50:49.030 --> 00:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
wishes to testify on House Bill
 
00:50:52.150 --> 00:50:52.160 align:start position:0%
1333 seeing none I'll close the hearing
 
00:50:55.910 --> 00:50:55.920 align:start position:0%

representative Tony leus representing
 
00:51:10.150 --> 00:51:10.160 align:start position:0%
towns of Hudson and Lichfield uh
 
00:51:12.990 --> 00:51:13.000 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro District 38 um the prime
 
00:51:14.829 --> 00:51:14.839 align:start position:0%
sponsor representative n could not be
 
00:51:16.270 --> 00:51:16.280 align:start position:0%
here and just asked me to introduce the
 
00:51:18.309 --> 00:51:18.319 align:start position:0%
bill and that's all I'm doing I believe
 
00:51:20.390 --> 00:51:20.400 align:start position:0%
there are other people here to uh speak
 
00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:21.430 align:start position:0%
there are other people here to uh speak
on

00:51:21.430 --> 00:51:21.440 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:51:25.470 --> 00:51:25.480 align:start position:0%
it um basically this would uh prohibit
 
00:51:27.870 --> 00:51:27.880 align:start position:0%
the uh government procurement of
 
00:51:29.670 --> 00:51:29.680 align:start position:0%
electric electric veh vehicles
 
00:51:31.829 --> 00:51:31.839 align:start position:0%
containing components uh created through
 
00:51:35.030 --> 00:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
in use of force labor and it goes on uh
 
00:51:38.750 --> 00:51:38.760 align:start position:0%
to you know detail just what that means
 
00:51:40.230 --> 00:51:40.240 align:start position:0%
and I really don't have anything else to
 
00:51:43.789 --> 00:51:43.799 align:start position:0%
say on this all right thank
 
00:51:54.349 --> 00:51:54.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:54.359 --> 00:51:56.710 align:start position:0%
 
Paul

00:51:56.710 --> 00:51:56.720 align:start position:0%
Paul
 
00:51:58.630 --> 00:51:58.640 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you for having me uh
 
00:52:00.670 --> 00:52:00.680 align:start position:0%
my name is Nick Paul I'm the director of
 
00:52:02.630 --> 00:52:02.640 align:start position:0%
legislative affairs for clean energy New
 
00:52:05.549 --> 00:52:05.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we're usually over in st&amp; so
 
00:52:07.069 --> 00:52:07.079 align:start position:0%
if you're not familiar with clean energy
 
00:52:09.630 --> 00:52:09.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh we are a bipartisan
 
00:52:12.150 --> 00:52:12.160 align:start position:0%
nonprofit 501c3
 
00:52:14.829 --> 00:52:14.839 align:start position:0%
organization uh seeking to lead the
 
00:52:16.510 --> 00:52:16.520 align:start position:0%
clean energy transition here in New
 
00:52:17.950 --> 00:52:17.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire looking at these issues
 
00:52:20.390 --> 00:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
through a fact-based lens I don't have
 
00:52:22.870 --> 00:52:22.880 align:start position:0%
prepared testimony today uh I'm going to
 
00:52:26.910 --> 00:52:26.920 align:start position:0%
be uh very brief um because our position
 
00:52:28.230 --> 00:52:28.240 align:start position:0%
on this bill is is fairly
 
00:52:30.030 --> 00:52:30.040 align:start position:0%
straightforward uh the first point I
 
00:52:32.630 --> 00:52:32.640 align:start position:0%
would make is that while uh there are
 
00:52:35.309 --> 00:52:35.319 align:start position:0%
several thousand pure electric vehicles
 
00:52:38.430 --> 00:52:38.440 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire today uh forecasts from
 
00:52:41.829 --> 00:52:41.839 align:start position:0%
ISO New England uh predict that by 2032
 
00:52:44.190 --> 00:52:44.200 align:start position:0%
that number will be at least 165,000
 
00:52:46.950 --> 00:52:46.960 align:start position:0%
there will be 2.2 million in surrounding
 
00:52:51.230 --> 00:52:51.240 align:start position:0%
states and many more uh in Canadian
 
00:52:55.670 --> 00:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
provinces uh so uh whether we personally
 
00:52:57.390 --> 00:52:57.400 align:start position:0%
believe that electric vehicles are a
 
00:52:58.950 --> 00:52:58.960 align:start position:0%
technology that's ready for prime time
 
00:53:02.230 --> 00:53:02.240 align:start position:0%
or not uh they are coming and I I I'm
 
00:53:04.430 --> 00:53:04.440 align:start position:0%
sure uh folks on this committee don't
 
00:53:08.150 --> 00:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
need to be reminded that 2032 is not uh
 
00:53:10.109 --> 00:53:10.119 align:start position:0%
way off into the future it's eight eight
 
00:53:13.630 --> 00:53:13.640 align:start position:0%
years from now um the second thing is I
 
00:53:15.789 --> 00:53:15.799 align:start position:0%
would like to talk a little bit about
 
00:53:19.950 --> 00:53:19.960 align:start position:0%
Cobalt um Cobalt is used for many many
 
00:53:22.710 --> 00:53:22.720 align:start position:0%
many many things that we use every day
 
00:53:26.109 --> 00:53:26.119 align:start position:0%
um it's used in medicine uh it's used in
 
00:53:29.069 --> 00:53:29.079 align:start position:0%
the manufacturing of Prosthetics it's
 
00:53:32.589 --> 00:53:32.599 align:start position:0%
used uh in its Cobalt 60 form to treat
 
00:53:34.430 --> 00:53:34.440 align:start position:0%
some forms of cancer and to sterilize
 
00:53:37.030 --> 00:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
medical supplies uh as we know we're
 
00:53:38.789 --> 00:53:38.799 align:start position:0%
talking about here today it's used in
 
00:53:40.789 --> 00:53:40.799 align:start position:0%
lithium ion batteries that are used in
 
00:53:42.270 --> 00:53:42.280 align:start position:0%
several different devices not just
 
00:53:45.030 --> 00:53:45.040 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles uh it is used in
 
00:53:47.589 --> 00:53:47.599 align:start position:0%
industry uh to make super Alloys for
 
00:53:51.190 --> 00:53:51.200 align:start position:0%
turbine engine parts um it is used to
 
00:53:56.030 --> 00:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
make magnets uh uh that are used in
 
00:53:57.750 --> 00:53:57.760 align:start position:0%
microphones the connection to this bill
 
00:53:59.950 --> 00:53:59.960 align:start position:0%
is hearing aids oh I I assure you I'm
 
00:54:04.270 --> 00:54:04.280 align:start position:0%
bringing it right there uh hearing aids
 
00:54:07.150 --> 00:54:07.160 align:start position:0%
microphones uh it is used in drying
 
00:54:09.670 --> 00:54:09.680 align:start position:0%
agents for paints and varnishes and if
 
00:54:12.190 --> 00:54:12.200 align:start position:0%
none of that is compelling because we're
 
00:54:14.349 --> 00:54:14.359 align:start position:0%
not as a state procuring all of these
 
00:54:18.349 --> 00:54:18.359 align:start position:0%
things right now right um I I would uh
 
00:54:20.829 --> 00:54:20.839 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that you're aware that
 
00:54:22.670 --> 00:54:22.680 align:start position:0%
Cobalt is also used to
 
00:54:25.309 --> 00:54:25.319 align:start position:0%
manufacture uh airbags and radial tires
 
00:54:28.630 --> 00:54:28.640 align:start position:0%
that are on uh I would assume all of the
 
00:54:31.870 --> 00:54:31.880 align:start position:0%
internal combustion engine cars that we
 
00:54:33.870 --> 00:54:33.880 align:start position:0%
uh used to get here today unless you
 
00:54:35.829 --> 00:54:35.839 align:start position:0%
have a cool antique car in which case I
 
00:54:40.309 --> 00:54:40.319 align:start position:0%
would love to check it out um so
 
00:54:42.910 --> 00:54:42.920 align:start position:0%
uh bringing it back to this bill uh
 
00:54:44.230 --> 00:54:44.240 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about any of those
 
00:54:45.710 --> 00:54:45.720 align:start position:0%
other products today we're not talking
 
00:54:47.990 --> 00:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
about the Cobalt that's being used in
 
00:54:49.510 --> 00:54:49.520 align:start position:0%
our internal combustion engine cars
 
00:54:51.069 --> 00:54:51.079 align:start position:0%
we're just talking about electric
 
00:54:53.670 --> 00:54:53.680 align:start position:0%
vehicles right so we're targeting one
 
00:54:56.109 --> 00:54:56.119 align:start position:0%
product um with which suggests to me
 
00:54:57.829 --> 00:54:57.839 align:start position:0%
that perhaps we're not talking about
 
00:55:00.750 --> 00:55:00.760 align:start position:0%
forced labor or child labor we're
 
00:55:03.589 --> 00:55:03.599 align:start position:0%
talking about our our personal political
 
00:55:06.109 --> 00:55:06.119 align:start position:0%
feelings about electric vehicles I would
 
00:55:08.190 --> 00:55:08.200 align:start position:0%
suggest that folks uh look at Senate
 
00:55:10.789 --> 00:55:10.799 align:start position:0%
Bill 430 which has been brought by
 
00:55:13.710 --> 00:55:13.720 align:start position:0%
senator berdel in the Senate that looks
 
00:55:18.750 --> 00:55:18.760 align:start position:0%
to study and understand uh the the real
 
00:55:20.510 --> 00:55:20.520 align:start position:0%
challenges and questions we have to
 
00:55:22.190 --> 00:55:22.200 align:start position:0%
answer in terms of electric vehicle
 
00:55:24.390 --> 00:55:24.400 align:start position:0%
adoption again we are a nonpartisan
 
00:55:26.349 --> 00:55:26.359 align:start position:0%
organization we do not pick technologies
 
00:55:28.029 --> 00:55:28.039 align:start position:0%
that we like and ignore the problems
 
00:55:30.029 --> 00:55:30.039 align:start position:0%
with them there are questions that need
 
00:55:32.270 --> 00:55:32.280 align:start position:0%
to be answered that is a bill that I
 
00:55:34.150 --> 00:55:34.160 align:start position:0%
would encourage folks to look at and
 
00:55:36.309 --> 00:55:36.319 align:start position:0%
support uh I would encourage you to look
 
00:55:38.230 --> 00:55:38.240 align:start position:0%
back on the testimony of the State Fire
 
00:55:40.589 --> 00:55:40.599 align:start position:0%
Marshall during that bill which refutes
 
00:55:42.470 --> 00:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
some of the misinformation on electric
 
00:55:43.990 --> 00:55:44.000 align:start position:0%
vehicles that you've heard in this room
 
00:55:46.470 --> 00:55:46.480 align:start position:0%
today um and I believe this afternoon
 
00:55:48.789 --> 00:55:48.799 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1510 is being heard uh which
 
00:55:51.510 --> 00:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
is a slightly different bill but again
 
00:55:53.230 --> 00:55:53.240 align:start position:0%
is a is a
 
00:55:56.870 --> 00:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
serious uh attempt to understand and
 
00:55:58.069 --> 00:55:58.079 align:start position:0%
solve these
 
00:56:00.029 --> 00:56:00.039 align:start position:0%
problems and that's all I have to say
 
00:56:04.430 --> 00:56:04.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:07.990 --> 00:56:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:09.990 --> 00:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
Fitzgerald oh excuse me representative
 
00:56:13.069 --> 00:56:13.079 align:start position:0%
Schmid you have a question well I Mr
 
00:56:14.910 --> 00:56:14.920 align:start position:0%
Paul seems to have quite a bit of
 
00:56:17.069 --> 00:56:17.079 align:start position:0%
knowledge that might be helpful to the
 
00:56:19.430 --> 00:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
committee if we go to subcommittee I'm
 
00:56:21.510 --> 00:56:21.520 align:start position:0%
just wondering whether you might be
 
00:56:25.710 --> 00:56:25.720 align:start position:0%
available because um we need get at the
 
00:56:28.990 --> 00:56:29.000 align:start position:0%
entire problem complex that is involved
 
00:56:30.950 --> 00:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
here if we're going to make a
 
00:56:33.109 --> 00:56:33.119 align:start position:0%
responsible decision for the state on
 
00:56:34.349 --> 00:56:34.359 align:start position:0%
this and other
 
00:56:37.349 --> 00:56:37.359 align:start position:0%
bills uh you're clearly informed would
 
00:56:40.069 --> 00:56:40.079 align:start position:0%
you be available for assisting the
 
00:56:43.069 --> 00:56:43.079 align:start position:0%
committee in our further research and
 
00:56:45.670 --> 00:56:45.680 align:start position:0%
study of this issue if we go to
 
00:56:48.470 --> 00:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
subcommittee uh certainly so I I
 
00:56:53.349 --> 00:56:53.359 align:start position:0%
appreciate your your earnest uh
 
00:56:56.309 --> 00:56:56.319 align:start position:0%
uh pursuit of more information I would
 
00:56:58.829 --> 00:56:58.839 align:start position:0%
suggest that I'm not a technical expert
 
00:57:01.589 --> 00:57:01.599 align:start position:0%
um but I my colleague Chris gogland who
 
00:57:03.630 --> 00:57:03.640 align:start position:0%
heads our Drive Electric New Hampshire
 
00:57:06.309 --> 00:57:06.319 align:start position:0%
initiative um would be more than happy
 
00:57:07.710 --> 00:57:07.720 align:start position:0%
to make himself available to the
 
00:57:09.270 --> 00:57:09.280 align:start position:0%
committee to answer your technical
 
00:57:10.950 --> 00:57:10.960 align:start position:0%
questions about electric vehicles and
 
00:57:12.470 --> 00:57:12.480 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle adoption we'd be more
 
00:57:14.870 --> 00:57:14.880 align:start position:0%
than happy to help with that thank you
 
00:57:19.029 --> 00:57:19.039 align:start position:0%
great thank you thank you m
 
00:57:22.349 --> 00:57:22.359 align:start position:0%
Fredericks what happened to Mr oh F
 
00:57:25.029 --> 00:57:25.039 align:start position:0%
sorry we still haven't gotten to Mr
 
00:57:36.390 --> 00:57:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:38.710 --> 00:57:38.720 align:start position:0%
that's good morning members of the
 
00:57:40.829 --> 00:57:40.839 align:start position:0%
committee Madam chair again uh Mike
 
00:57:42.230 --> 00:57:42.240 align:start position:0%
Fitzgerald with the Department of
 
00:57:43.870 --> 00:57:43.880 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services I'm the assistant
 
00:57:46.029 --> 00:57:46.039 align:start position:0%
director of the air Resources Division
 
00:57:48.230 --> 00:57:48.240 align:start position:0%
my testimony on this bill uh largely
 
00:57:51.029 --> 00:57:51.039 align:start position:0%
mirrors the testimony on the last bill
 
00:57:53.710 --> 00:57:53.720 align:start position:0%
so I won't repeat that um but I would
 
00:57:55.750 --> 00:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
would add that um we certainly concur
 
00:57:58.349 --> 00:57:58.359 align:start position:0%
with the uh uh testimony you just heard
 
00:58:01.670 --> 00:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
that there are a wide range of products
 
00:58:04.029 --> 00:58:04.039 align:start position:0%
that we use today modern Electronics
 
00:58:08.390 --> 00:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
vehicles um U medicine Etc um that have
 
00:58:10.270 --> 00:58:10.280 align:start position:0%
many of these components that are of
 
00:58:12.430 --> 00:58:12.440 align:start position:0%
concern uh it's not just related to
 
00:58:14.710 --> 00:58:14.720 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles and so we would
 
00:58:18.390 --> 00:58:18.400 align:start position:0%
question um why this bill targets only
 
00:58:23.390 --> 00:58:23.400 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles um but uh uh we think
 
00:58:25.270 --> 00:58:25.280 align:start position:0%
that's certainly a valid point but um
 
00:58:27.150 --> 00:58:27.160 align:start position:0%
the rest of my testimony again would be
 
00:58:30.789 --> 00:58:30.799 align:start position:0%
uh very similar to uh ask you to direct
 
00:58:34.990 --> 00:58:35.000 align:start position:0%
your um uh these to potentially consider
 
00:58:38.309 --> 00:58:38.319 align:start position:0%
interim study and uh U allow the s sp430
 
00:58:40.630 --> 00:58:40.640 align:start position:0%
or hb1 1510 commissions to consider
 
00:58:40.640 --> 00:58:41.670 align:start position:0%
or hb1 1510 commissions to consider
these

00:58:41.670 --> 00:58:41.680 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:58:44.750 --> 00:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
issues thank
 
00:58:53.710 --> 00:58:53.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:53.720 --> 00:59:01.670 align:start position:0%
 
frericks

00:59:01.670 --> 00:59:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:03.589 --> 00:59:03.599 align:start position:0%
turn please turn your microphone on
 
00:59:06.750 --> 00:59:06.760 align:start position:0%
thank you um em friedricks again uh from
 
00:59:10.230 --> 00:59:10.240 align:start position:0%
350 New Hampshire action and also um
 
00:59:12.710 --> 00:59:12.720 align:start position:0%
elected official in the town of Durham
 
00:59:16.150 --> 00:59:16.160 align:start position:0%
um so uh while I really commend the um
 
00:59:18.150 --> 00:59:18.160 align:start position:0%
this the co-sponsors of this bill for
 
00:59:20.109 --> 00:59:20.119 align:start position:0%
wanting to take an an ethical approach
 
00:59:22.589 --> 00:59:22.599 align:start position:0%
to State procurement uh I want to just
 
00:59:25.750 --> 00:59:25.760 align:start position:0%
concur that um I think this B is not
 
00:59:28.109 --> 00:59:28.119 align:start position:0%
really doing that because the large
 
00:59:31.470 --> 00:59:31.480 align:start position:0%
majority of sourcing um of cobalt um is
 
00:59:33.109 --> 00:59:33.119 align:start position:0%
not necessarily directed to electric
 
00:59:35.829 --> 00:59:35.839 align:start position:0%
vehicles so um it seems to rather than
 
00:59:37.470 --> 00:59:37.480 align:start position:0%
be really focusing on an ethical
 
00:59:40.309 --> 00:59:40.319 align:start position:0%
approach to procuring materials um to
 
00:59:43.270 --> 00:59:43.280 align:start position:0%
rather be looking for um a way to Target
 
00:59:45.710 --> 00:59:45.720 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles and very specifically
 
00:59:47.670 --> 00:59:47.680 align:start position:0%
how this would affect um for example
 
00:59:49.829 --> 00:59:49.839 align:start position:0%
Durham taxpayers is that in this last
 
00:59:52.990 --> 00:59:53.000 align:start position:0%
budget season we um received a $900,000
 
00:59:56.309 --> 00:59:56.319 align:start position:0%
grant which is about 4% of our annual
 
01:00:00.109 --> 01:00:00.119 align:start position:0%
budget um to help us uh fix and replace
 
01:00:02.870 --> 01:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
our garbage truck Fleet um we needed to
 
01:00:06.190 --> 01:00:06.200 align:start position:0%
procur three new vehicles um for our
 
01:00:08.510 --> 01:00:08.520 align:start position:0%
garbage and recycling trucks and the
 
01:00:12.470 --> 01:00:12.480 align:start position:0%
fund that helped us with that um was uh
 
01:00:16.589 --> 01:00:16.599 align:start position:0%
distributed by the um nhdes and it was
 
01:00:19.789 --> 01:00:19.799 align:start position:0%
the Volkswagen fund um so the town of
 
01:00:22.150 --> 01:00:22.160 align:start position:0%
Durham and its taxpayers would suddenly
 
01:00:26.069 --> 01:00:26.079 align:start position:0%
have a $900,000 gap in our budget a 4%
 
01:00:28.150 --> 01:00:28.160 align:start position:0%
difference in our budget if the state
 
01:00:32.829 --> 01:00:32.839 align:start position:0%
were not able to support um support the
 
01:00:34.870 --> 01:00:34.880 align:start position:0%
procurement of electric vehicles and so
 
01:00:38.670 --> 01:00:38.680 align:start position:0%
there are very real um uh consequences
 
01:00:42.270 --> 01:00:42.280 align:start position:0%
for um State residents and for um the
 
01:00:44.910 --> 01:00:44.920 align:start position:0%
budgets of um of other entities across
 
01:00:48.150 --> 01:00:48.160 align:start position:0%
the state by um by putting forward a
 
01:00:51.109 --> 01:00:51.119 align:start position:0%
bill like this um that's the if I'll
 
01:00:52.829 --> 01:00:52.839 align:start position:0%
take any questions if you may have them
 
01:00:55.950 --> 01:00:55.960 align:start position:0%
but that's all I wanted to add
 
01:00:57.750 --> 01:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
representative Brown uh thank you madam
 
01:01:00.470 --> 01:01:00.480 align:start position:0%
chair uh thank you could you clarify for
 
01:01:03.270 --> 01:01:03.280 align:start position:0%
me what you just said if um if this
 
01:01:04.670 --> 01:01:04.680 align:start position:0%
passes you wouldn't be able to spend the
 
01:01:07.069 --> 01:01:07.079 align:start position:0%
$900,000 you received from
 
01:01:09.789 --> 01:01:09.799 align:start position:0%
Dees I'm assuming because you're going
 
01:01:12.270 --> 01:01:12.280 align:start position:0%
to buy electric waste Vehicles that's
 
01:01:15.309 --> 01:01:15.319 align:start position:0%
the plan that's correct so um our public
 
01:01:17.470 --> 01:01:17.480 align:start position:0%
works department did due diligence to
 
01:01:19.069 --> 01:01:19.079 align:start position:0%
figure out what was most cost effective
 
01:01:20.789 --> 01:01:20.799 align:start position:0%
for the town these were the models that
 
01:01:24.069 --> 01:01:24.079 align:start position:0%
were selected um and we were able to pay
 
01:01:26.109 --> 01:01:26.119 align:start position:0%
for that in our budget um we have not
 
01:01:27.910 --> 01:01:27.920 align:start position:0%
yet received those funds so that's not
 
01:01:29.750 --> 01:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
that the town currently holds them so if
 
01:01:32.029 --> 01:01:32.039 align:start position:0%
this bill were to pass um and we hadn't
 
01:01:34.870 --> 01:01:34.880 align:start position:0%
yet received the funds um we would be
 
01:01:36.750 --> 01:01:36.760 align:start position:0%
short almost a million dollars which is
 
01:01:39.349 --> 01:01:39.359 align:start position:0%
4% of our town
 
01:01:45.349 --> 01:01:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:48.789 --> 01:01:48.799 align:start position:0%
you does anyone else wish to testify on
 
01:01:51.349 --> 01:01:51.359 align:start position:0%
House Bill 15 to
 
01:01:54.150 --> 01:01:54.160 align:start position:0%
80 okay seeing none I will close the
 
01:01:57.190 --> 01:01:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:57.200 --> 01:02:00.750 align:start position:0%
 
hearing

01:02:00.750 --> 01:02:00.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:02.710 --> 01:02:02.720 align:start position:0%
and what's
 
01:02:06.069 --> 01:02:06.079 align:start position:0%
up and I'd like to go into executive
 
01:02:09.269 --> 01:02:09.279 align:start position:0%
session on House Bill 1580 and I will
 
01:02:12.349 --> 01:02:12.359 align:start position:0%
entertain a motion Madam chair I make a
 
01:02:14.950 --> 01:02:14.960 align:start position:0%
motion to itl House Bill
 
01:02:17.950 --> 01:02:17.960 align:start position:0%
1580 do we have a
 
01:02:23.349 --> 01:02:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:25.910 --> 01:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
okay wish to speak to your
 
01:02:28.109 --> 01:02:28.119 align:start position:0%
motion yes thank you madam chair
 
01:02:31.069 --> 01:02:31.079 align:start position:0%
although perhaps well intentioned the um
 
01:02:35.029 --> 01:02:35.039 align:start position:0%
bill um prohibits the use of other
 
01:02:36.710 --> 01:02:36.720 align:start position:0%
materials in New Hampshire other than
 
01:02:38.430 --> 01:02:38.440 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles I don't think it's
 
01:02:42.589 --> 01:02:42.599 align:start position:0%
really well thought out and um that's my
 
01:02:45.829 --> 01:02:45.839 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm making that motion repres
 
01:02:48.750 --> 01:02:48.760 align:start position:0%
schm I don't have anything additional
 
01:02:51.750 --> 01:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
other than what the prime mover has
 
01:02:56.829 --> 01:02:56.839 align:start position:0%
suggested represent laus um well I you
 
01:02:58.109 --> 01:02:58.119 align:start position:0%
know I may believe there are some
 
01:02:59.630 --> 01:02:59.640 align:start position:0%
problems with how electric vehicles are
 
01:03:01.390 --> 01:03:01.400 align:start position:0%
made I think that uh trying to solve
 
01:03:02.990 --> 01:03:03.000 align:start position:0%
those problems by burdening the
 
01:03:05.349 --> 01:03:05.359 align:start position:0%
procurement process with the job of
 
01:03:06.910 --> 01:03:06.920 align:start position:0%
trying to figure it out and enforce it
 
01:03:09.670 --> 01:03:09.680 align:start position:0%
is not the way to
 
01:03:11.710 --> 01:03:11.720 align:start position:0%
go I would have to agree with
 
01:03:13.990 --> 01:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
representative leus on that any other
 
01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:14.990 align:start position:0%
representative leus on that any other
representative

01:03:14.990 --> 01:03:15.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:03:17.829 --> 01:03:17.839 align:start position:0%
manuti thank you madam chair uh my
 
01:03:21.630 --> 01:03:21.640 align:start position:0%
question is it's it's directed to
 
01:03:23.910 --> 01:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle what percentage of
 
01:03:27.029 --> 01:03:27.039 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles are manufactured and
 
01:03:31.549 --> 01:03:31.559 align:start position:0%
assembled in the US and so that would
 
01:03:31.559 --> 01:03:32.990 align:start position:0%
assembled in the US and so that would
exclude

01:03:32.990 --> 01:03:33.000 align:start position:0%
exclude
 
01:03:37.589 --> 01:03:37.599 align:start position:0%
anything so this uh by putting a
 
01:03:40.470 --> 01:03:40.480 align:start position:0%
Prohibition on procurement this would
 
01:03:43.349 --> 01:03:43.359 align:start position:0%
make it harder to go forward with the
 
01:03:45.069 --> 01:03:45.079 align:start position:0%
right we're not going to we're not we're
 
01:03:47.029 --> 01:03:47.039 align:start position:0%
killing we would like to itl the bill so
 
01:03:49.510 --> 01:03:49.520 align:start position:0%
that's not right yeah I I am supporting
 
01:03:52.710 --> 01:03:52.720 align:start position:0%
the killing of the uh okay yes the
 
01:03:55.670 --> 01:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
whether it's made or assembled in the US
 
01:03:56.950 --> 01:03:56.960 align:start position:0%
they're talking
 
01:03:59.990 --> 01:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
about constituent parts or mining or
 
01:04:02.990 --> 01:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
other sourcing of any other materials
 
01:04:06.349 --> 01:04:06.359 align:start position:0%
and the mining of many of the materials
 
01:04:12.069 --> 01:04:12.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:15.069 --> 01:04:15.079 align:start position:0%
people okay representative leus yeah
 
01:04:17.349 --> 01:04:17.359 align:start position:0%
just briefly to clarify if you look at
 
01:04:19.789 --> 01:04:19.799 align:start position:0%
uh the last section said it applies both
 
01:04:21.630 --> 01:04:21.640 align:start position:0%
domestic and international Force labor
 
01:04:24.549 --> 01:04:24.559 align:start position:0%
so it's uh it applies wherever the world
 
01:04:26.109 --> 01:04:26.119 align:start position:0%
it takes
 
01:04:28.069 --> 01:04:28.079 align:start position:0%
place all
 
01:04:30.069 --> 01:04:30.079 align:start position:0%
right which is part of the problem with
 
01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
the Department trying to figure this
 
01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:33.510 align:start position:0%
the Department trying to figure this
out

01:04:33.510 --> 01:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:04:39.029 --> 01:04:39.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:41.910 --> 01:04:41.920 align:start position:0%
would even if it were obvious what
 
01:04:45.349 --> 01:04:45.359 align:start position:0%
materials were from Forced labor or
 
01:04:49.069 --> 01:04:49.079 align:start position:0%
whatever it the documentation would be a
 
01:04:52.750 --> 01:04:52.760 align:start position:0%
handicap to every town city county and
 
01:04:57.190 --> 01:04:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:59.670 --> 01:04:59.680 align:start position:0%
any other like us and just briefly I
 
01:05:02.510 --> 01:05:02.520 align:start position:0%
mean um I really don't want to set the
 
01:05:04.390 --> 01:05:04.400 align:start position:0%
precent of doing things this way because
 
01:05:06.870 --> 01:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
it might be convenient to enforce almost
 
01:05:10.269 --> 01:05:10.279 align:start position:0%
anything um by forcing the procurement
 
01:05:12.230 --> 01:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
system to deal with it but that's just
 
01:05:13.990 --> 01:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
not the way to go it's going to burn the
 
01:05:15.829 --> 01:05:15.839 align:start position:0%
procurement system and there's if
 
01:05:17.230 --> 01:05:17.240 align:start position:0%
somebody believes it's a problem then
 
01:05:19.750 --> 01:05:19.760 align:start position:0%
there should be other laws whatever to
 
01:05:22.150 --> 01:05:22.160 align:start position:0%
deal with it anyone
 
01:05:25.150 --> 01:05:25.160 align:start position:0%
else okay then the motion is is itl by
 
01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:27.230 align:start position:0%
else okay then the motion is is itl by
representative

01:05:27.230 --> 01:05:27.240 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:05:30.109 --> 01:05:30.119 align:start position:0%
groer and the clerk can call the
 
01:05:33.430 --> 01:05:33.440 align:start position:0%
role okay
 
01:05:37.549 --> 01:05:37.559 align:start position:0%
um representative Boyd yes
 
01:05:37.559 --> 01:05:40.829 align:start position:0%
um representative Boyd yes

01:07:22.309 --> 01:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
to your
 
01:07:25.269 --> 01:07:25.279 align:start position:0%
motion um sure Ian there are concerns
 
01:07:27.670 --> 01:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
around um the electric vehicles it's not
 
01:07:29.390 --> 01:07:29.400 align:start position:0%
clear it's a good idea for the state to
 
01:07:31.670 --> 01:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
be procuring them although the the
 
01:07:34.430 --> 01:07:34.440 align:start position:0%
fellow from do said that they they
 
01:07:37.910 --> 01:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
haven't been um but given that there's
 
01:07:40.829 --> 01:07:40.839 align:start position:0%
there may very well be um a commission
 
01:07:42.670 --> 01:07:42.680 align:start position:0%
looking into the larger issues around
 
01:07:45.829 --> 01:07:45.839 align:start position:0%
this um I'm fine with deferring to see
 
01:07:48.510 --> 01:07:48.520 align:start position:0%
what happens with that and I'd rather
 
01:07:50.789 --> 01:07:50.799 align:start position:0%
not do itl well it's not going to be the
 
01:07:53.549 --> 01:07:53.559 align:start position:0%
second year but still um I don't know
 
01:07:55.230 --> 01:07:55.240 align:start position:0%
that it's wrong so interim study seems
 
01:07:58.750 --> 01:07:58.760 align:start position:0%
like a reasonable way to go all right
 
01:07:58.760 --> 01:07:59.950 align:start position:0%
like a reasonable way to go all right
representa

01:07:59.950 --> 01:07:59.960 align:start position:0%

01:08:02.870 --> 01:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
goalie thank you madam chair well
 
01:08:06.789 --> 01:08:06.799 align:start position:0%
understanding the issues uh surrounding
 
01:08:06.799 --> 01:08:08.069 align:start position:0%
understanding the issues uh surrounding
you

01:08:08.069 --> 01:08:08.079 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:08:11.870 --> 01:08:11.880 align:start position:0%
know the toxicities and the fires that
 
01:08:14.069 --> 01:08:14.079 align:start position:0%
may happen with these vehicles um with
 
01:08:17.110 --> 01:08:17.120 align:start position:0%
my expertise in the fire service um I
 
01:08:19.269 --> 01:08:19.279 align:start position:0%
think that the bill out there that looks
 
01:08:22.590 --> 01:08:22.600 align:start position:0%
to study these going forward to get all
 
01:08:24.349 --> 01:08:24.359 align:start position:0%
the information needed um because it
 
01:08:25.510 --> 01:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
sounds like there is a lot more
 
01:08:27.590 --> 01:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
information to gather that it would be
 
01:08:28.870 --> 01:08:28.880 align:start position:0%
better to wait for those two bills to
 
01:08:30.990 --> 01:08:31.000 align:start position:0%
come forward um before moving this bill
 
01:08:34.789 --> 01:08:34.799 align:start position:0%
okay does anyone else repr man buy uh a
 
01:08:38.630 --> 01:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
just a quick comment about yes this is
 
01:08:40.669 --> 01:08:40.679 align:start position:0%
studies needed but this is the second
 
01:08:44.030 --> 01:08:44.040 align:start position:0%
year of the session so how effective is
 
01:08:47.229 --> 01:08:47.239 align:start position:0%
the interim study in terms of getting it
 
01:08:49.430 --> 01:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
well if we were to itl it were to pass
 
01:08:51.870 --> 01:08:51.880 align:start position:0%
the house that would prohibit bringing a
 
01:08:54.550 --> 01:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
similar bill in from the Senate
 
01:08:57.430 --> 01:08:57.440 align:start position:0%
which which if they have studied it and
 
01:08:59.349 --> 01:08:59.359 align:start position:0%
or gathered more information might not
 
01:09:03.189 --> 01:09:03.199 align:start position:0%
be what you want thank
 
01:09:05.669 --> 01:09:05.679 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
01:09:09.630 --> 01:09:09.640 align:start position:0%
Smith the C thank thank you mad chair uh
 
01:09:11.789 --> 01:09:11.799 align:start position:0%
excuse me I was represen representative
 
01:09:14.070 --> 01:09:14.080 align:start position:0%
Schmid and she hasn't spoken
 
01:09:18.950 --> 01:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
yet sorry I beg your pardon a thousand
 
01:09:22.550 --> 01:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
times one is good enough okay Madame
 
01:09:26.349 --> 01:09:26.359 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for calling on me um the
 
01:09:28.990 --> 01:09:29.000 align:start position:0%
cost of replacing a battery is going to
 
01:09:33.229 --> 01:09:33.239 align:start position:0%
be as expensive as buying a new vehicle
 
01:09:34.870 --> 01:09:34.880 align:start position:0%
I think we need to think about that some
 
01:09:36.950 --> 01:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
of these places that the fire
 
01:09:38.669 --> 01:09:38.679 align:start position:0%
departments or the police departments or
 
01:09:41.430 --> 01:09:41.440 align:start position:0%
even individuals if you buy a car and
 
01:09:44.070 --> 01:09:44.080 align:start position:0%
you pay $75,000 for it and you have to
 
01:09:46.829 --> 01:09:46.839 align:start position:0%
replace the battery within a couple of
 
01:09:50.070 --> 01:09:50.080 align:start position:0%
years you're paying another 60 how many
 
01:09:52.309 --> 01:09:52.319 align:start position:0%
people I granted it's good for the
 
01:09:54.390 --> 01:09:54.400 align:start position:0%
environment I agree
 
01:09:56.229 --> 01:09:56.239 align:start position:0%
but how many people can afford to
 
01:09:58.709 --> 01:09:58.719 align:start position:0%
operate a an electric
 
01:10:01.310 --> 01:10:01.320 align:start position:0%
vehicle and you have to put money into
 
01:10:04.910 --> 01:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
building the places for them to plug in
 
01:10:06.270 --> 01:10:06.280 align:start position:0%
along the
 
01:10:09.830 --> 01:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
highways how practical is all of this
 
01:10:14.510 --> 01:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I regardless of the uh EPA
 
01:10:18.750 --> 01:10:18.760 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure it's a expedient thing for
 
01:10:22.630 --> 01:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:24.149 align:start position:0%
 
will

01:10:24.149 --> 01:10:24.159 align:start position:0%
will
 
01:10:25.790 --> 01:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
but not
 
01:10:29.550 --> 01:10:29.560 align:start position:0%
yet thank you representative
 
01:10:33.070 --> 01:10:33.080 align:start position:0%
Schmidt okay I have to get my ears fixed
 
01:10:34.990 --> 01:10:35.000 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I misunderstood you when you
 
01:10:37.030 --> 01:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
called representative
 
01:10:42.550 --> 01:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
Smith uh so this is clearly an extremely
 
01:10:45.630 --> 01:10:45.640 align:start position:0%
involved situation which we need to get
 
01:10:48.430 --> 01:10:48.440 align:start position:0%
a lot more information before we make a
 
01:10:51.390 --> 01:10:51.400 align:start position:0%
wise decision so interim study would be
 
01:10:54.350 --> 01:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
the the appropriate step to take in my
 
01:10:56.189 --> 01:10:56.199 align:start position:0%
opinion I'll be voting yes on interim
 
01:10:58.790 --> 01:10:58.800 align:start position:0%

01:19:33.350 --> 01:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
made by the president of the United
 
01:19:35.669 --> 01:19:35.679 align:start position:0%
States this was basically to help them
 
01:19:38.510 --> 01:19:38.520 align:start position:0%
pay for repair work essentially Tiding
 
01:19:40.270 --> 01:19:40.280 align:start position:0%
them over until reimbursement is
 
01:19:43.110 --> 01:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
received from FEMA the problem with this
 
01:19:46.510 --> 01:19:46.520 align:start position:0%
method is that it is wholly unworkable
 
01:19:49.350 --> 01:19:49.360 align:start position:0%
and ex inexpedient for the municipality
 
01:19:51.830 --> 01:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
for a few reasons number
 
01:19:55.149 --> 01:19:55.159 align:start position:0%
one you have to wait many weeks and
 
01:19:57.310 --> 01:19:57.320 align:start position:0%
often months for a federal disaster
 
01:19:59.229 --> 01:19:59.239 align:start position:0%
declaration to be made by the president
 
01:20:01.830 --> 01:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
of the United States towns don't have
 
01:20:03.550 --> 01:20:03.560 align:start position:0%
the luxury of waiting weeks and months
 
01:20:05.910 --> 01:20:05.920 align:start position:0%
to make their roads passable and safe
 
01:20:08.270 --> 01:20:08.280 align:start position:0%
you cannot access State loan money until
 
01:20:10.310 --> 01:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
a federal disaster is
 
01:20:13.709 --> 01:20:13.719 align:start position:0%
declared number two the timing to obtain
 
01:20:15.790 --> 01:20:15.800 align:start position:0%
a loan from the state is way too long
 
01:20:17.709 --> 01:20:17.719 align:start position:0%
considering a municipality cannot get a
 
01:20:19.990 --> 01:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
loan until they get approval from the
 
01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:20.790 align:start position:0%
loan until they get approval from the
town

01:20:20.790 --> 01:20:20.800 align:start position:0%
town
 
01:20:23.350 --> 01:20:23.360 align:start position:0%
voters that involves setting up a town
 
01:20:25.870 --> 01:20:25.880 align:start position:0%
meeting it can take two months for a
 
01:20:27.950 --> 01:20:27.960 align:start position:0%
town meeting to get arranged especially
 
01:20:30.510 --> 01:20:30.520 align:start position:0%
if a bond attorney is needed by the town
 
01:20:32.830 --> 01:20:32.840 align:start position:0%
for obtaining a state loan plus a
 
01:20:34.990 --> 01:20:35.000 align:start position:0%
special town meeting can be a huge
 
01:20:37.790 --> 01:20:37.800 align:start position:0%
expense for a small town this is
 
01:20:39.990 --> 01:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
problematic for towns who wish to get
 
01:20:41.830 --> 01:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
the zero interest loans from the state
 
01:20:43.390 --> 01:20:43.400 align:start position:0%
as per RSA
 
01:20:48.350 --> 01:20:48.360 align:start position:0%
2-p colon 37 hyphen C for further
 
01:20:50.189 --> 01:20:50.199 align:start position:0%
legislation would be needed to
 
01:20:51.990 --> 01:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
streamline this special town meeting
 
01:20:54.669 --> 01:20:54.679 align:start position:0%
process in the event of a natural
 
01:20:58.149 --> 01:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
disaster it took aworth 66 days to get
 
01:20:59.750 --> 01:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
permission to hold and schedule a
 
01:21:02.510 --> 01:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
special town meeting in 2021 and I've
 
01:21:05.590 --> 01:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
passed out um a paper that shows you the
 
01:21:08.310 --> 01:21:08.320 align:start position:0%
timeline of how that
 
01:21:11.189 --> 01:21:11.199 align:start position:0%
happened that was back in 2022 when our
 
01:21:13.350 --> 01:21:13.360 align:start position:0%
state was flush with arpa funding a
 
01:21:13.360 --> 01:21:14.310 align:start position:0%
state was flush with arpa funding a
healthy

01:21:14.310 --> 01:21:14.320 align:start position:0%
healthy
 
01:21:16.870 --> 01:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
Surplus yet aworth couldn't get any
 
01:21:19.229 --> 01:21:19.239 align:start position:0%
immediate financial help from the
 
01:21:22.110 --> 01:21:22.120 align:start position:0%
state from the loan process set up by S
 
01:21:25.470 --> 01:21:25.480 align:start position:0%
sp4 in 2022 sought to fix that but it
 
01:21:28.590 --> 01:21:28.600 align:start position:0%
that didn't work there was and still is
 
01:21:31.510 --> 01:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
no other emergency statutory vehicle to
 
01:21:33.990 --> 01:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
help municipalities get back on their
 
01:21:38.709 --> 01:21:38.719 align:start position:0%
feet quickly so in 2022 aworth had to go
 
01:21:40.669 --> 01:21:40.679 align:start position:0%
get help elsewhere we held a town
 
01:21:44.910 --> 01:21:44.920 align:start position:0%
meeting to authorize a 2.1 loan dollar a
 
01:21:48.470 --> 01:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
$2.1 million loan from Mesa Bank who was
 
01:21:51.629 --> 01:21:51.639 align:start position:0%
willing to work with us it is
 
01:21:54.870 --> 01:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
2024 and we are still struggling to pay
 
01:21:57.950 --> 01:21:57.960 align:start position:0%
back that loan along with the $40,000
 
01:22:00.950 --> 01:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
interest because FEMA reimbursement has
 
01:22:03.470 --> 01:22:03.480 align:start position:0%
been so excruciatingly
 
01:22:06.270 --> 01:22:06.280 align:start position:0%
slow musoma bank has been patient and
 
01:22:08.350 --> 01:22:08.360 align:start position:0%
has been working with the town and our
 
01:22:10.430 --> 01:22:10.440 align:start position:0%
town has enormous Financial challenges
 
01:22:13.910 --> 01:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
facing us and 10 roads are still
 
01:22:17.350 --> 01:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
closed since s sp49 was ped I don't know
 
01:22:19.189 --> 01:22:19.199 align:start position:0%
of any town that has gotten any state
 
01:22:22.030 --> 01:22:22.040 align:start position:0%
loan after a flooding event aworth
 
01:22:23.830 --> 01:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
didn't even apply for the state loan
 
01:22:26.990 --> 01:22:27.000 align:start position:0%
after the 2023 flood because the process
 
01:22:29.629 --> 01:22:29.639 align:start position:0%
wasn't even in place and because we had
 
01:22:31.350 --> 01:22:31.360 align:start position:0%
already exceeded the amount the town
 
01:22:33.590 --> 01:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
could borrow and also because we didn't
 
01:22:35.629 --> 01:22:35.639 align:start position:0%
want to incur the expense of another
 
01:22:38.870 --> 01:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:41.270 --> 01:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
meeting number three the reimbursement
 
01:22:44.110 --> 01:22:44.120 align:start position:0%
for FEMA can take years it's been three
 
01:22:47.070 --> 01:22:47.080 align:start position:0%
years since the July 2021
 
01:22:49.990 --> 01:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
flood and we've still not received all
 
01:22:51.629 --> 01:22:51.639 align:start position:0%
the reimbursement for the work that's
 
01:22:54.629 --> 01:22:54.639 align:start position:0%
been done in the meantime we had that
 
01:22:57.189 --> 01:22:57.199 align:start position:0%
other flood in July 2023 that washed
 
01:22:59.110 --> 01:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
away all the work that we did to repair
 
01:23:01.950 --> 01:23:01.960 align:start position:0%
the roads from the 2021 flood had we
 
01:23:03.990 --> 01:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
gotten all the financial help we needed
 
01:23:07.310 --> 01:23:07.320 align:start position:0%
to get repairs done from the 2021 flood
 
01:23:08.990 --> 01:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't have had so much more damage
 
01:23:12.830 --> 01:23:12.840 align:start position:0%
in 2023 the fact is small towns like
 
01:23:16.229 --> 01:23:16.239 align:start position:0%
aworth that have about 850 people cannot
 
01:23:18.350 --> 01:23:18.360 align:start position:0%
absorb the kind of damage done overnight
 
01:23:21.189 --> 01:23:21.199 align:start position:0%
by these kinds of natural
 
01:23:24.070 --> 01:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
disasters they could save money for 20
 
01:23:29.870 --> 01:23:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:32.030 --> 01:23:32.040 align:start position:0%
whole because they just don't have the
 
01:23:34.510 --> 01:23:34.520 align:start position:0%
tax base and the resources to recover
 
01:23:34.520 --> 01:23:37.110 align:start position:0%
tax base and the resources to recover
from

01:23:37.110 --> 01:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:39.590 --> 01:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
it Decades of investment in their roads
 
01:23:41.430 --> 01:23:41.440 align:start position:0%
and bridges were demolished in one night
 
01:23:43.229 --> 01:23:43.239 align:start position:0%
causing issues concerning safety
 
01:23:45.030 --> 01:23:45.040 align:start position:0%
Commerce and environment and quality of
 
01:23:47.110 --> 01:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
life and I can tell you that my town
 
01:23:48.830 --> 01:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
suffered millions of dollars of road
 
01:23:51.149 --> 01:23:51.159 align:start position:0%
damage Bridge damage and crop damage
 
01:23:52.950 --> 01:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
Road repair work has been slow and
 
01:23:55.669 --> 01:23:55.679 align:start position:0%
expensive and not all of it is eligible
 
01:23:58.390 --> 01:23:58.400 align:start position:0%
for FEMA reimbursement on top of that
 
01:24:00.950 --> 01:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
FEMA only pays to put the road back to
 
01:24:03.149 --> 01:24:03.159 align:start position:0%
the condition it was before the disaster
 
01:24:05.990 --> 01:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
event so there may not even be coverage
 
01:24:08.510 --> 01:24:08.520 align:start position:0%
for mitigation efforts for larger
 
01:24:10.709 --> 01:24:10.719 align:start position:0%
culverts or Road diversion to prevent
 
01:24:13.229 --> 01:24:13.239 align:start position:0%
similar destruction from reoccurring and
 
01:24:15.790 --> 01:24:15.800 align:start position:0%
number four towns need access to funding
 
01:24:17.870 --> 01:24:17.880 align:start position:0%
as quickly as possible especially when
 
01:24:19.550 --> 01:24:19.560 align:start position:0%
the window of time to do construction
 
01:24:22.149 --> 01:24:22.159 align:start position:0%
work before the winter may be short
 
01:24:23.910 --> 01:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
again again current processes are
 
01:24:26.430 --> 01:24:26.440 align:start position:0%
extremely time consuming and I can tell
 
01:24:29.189 --> 01:24:29.199 align:start position:0%
you after the July 2021 flooding in
 
01:24:31.510 --> 01:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
aworth Dees and Homeland Security
 
01:24:34.030 --> 01:24:34.040 align:start position:0%
emergency management did not come until
 
01:24:36.510 --> 01:24:36.520 align:start position:0%
September 8th 2021 to assess damage a
 
01:24:38.709 --> 01:24:38.719 align:start position:0%
full month and a half after the floods
 
01:24:42.270 --> 01:24:42.280 align:start position:0%
hit us yet in that time period we had to
 
01:24:44.070 --> 01:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
make roads passable not only for
 
01:24:45.790 --> 01:24:45.800 align:start position:0%
emergency vehicles but are for our
 
01:24:48.310 --> 01:24:48.320 align:start position:0%
citizens safety we literally had one
 
01:24:50.149 --> 01:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
road available to get in and out of town
 
01:24:52.709 --> 01:24:52.719 align:start position:0%
for a time and currently at after the
 
01:24:55.470 --> 01:24:55.480 align:start position:0%
July 2023 floods we still have 10 roads
 
01:24:57.590 --> 01:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
that are closed and a totally destroyed
 
01:24:58.990 --> 01:24:59.000 align:start position:0%
bridge that won't be repaired for
 
01:25:01.590 --> 01:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
another two years I have a crater and an
 
01:25:03.870 --> 01:25:03.880 align:start position:0%
impassible bridge at the bottom of my
 
01:25:06.149 --> 01:25:06.159 align:start position:0%
driveway and every time I have asked
 
01:25:07.990 --> 01:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
about getting immediate State financial
 
01:25:10.270 --> 01:25:10.280 align:start position:0%
help from municipality that has suffered
 
01:25:12.030 --> 01:25:12.040 align:start position:0%
incredible loss due to this kind of
 
01:25:15.109 --> 01:25:15.119 align:start position:0%
extreme flooding I get the same answer
 
01:25:17.709 --> 01:25:17.719 align:start position:0%
we have AA available funds in the state
 
01:25:19.910 --> 01:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
but no statutory vehicle to get any kind
 
01:25:23.310 --> 01:25:23.320 align:start position:0%
of emergency funding to a municipality
 
01:25:26.229 --> 01:25:26.239 align:start position:0%
so here I am today with a plan to create
 
01:25:28.990 --> 01:25:29.000 align:start position:0%
a statutory vehicle we have a fund
 
01:25:31.390 --> 01:25:31.400 align:start position:0%
already established let's put money in
 
01:25:33.910 --> 01:25:33.920 align:start position:0%
it and allow towns that need help after
 
01:25:36.550 --> 01:25:36.560 align:start position:0%
disaster to access it I know there are
 
01:25:38.629 --> 01:25:38.639 align:start position:0%
some Kinks that need to be worked out
 
01:25:40.350 --> 01:25:40.360 align:start position:0%
but I'm open to any amendments to fix
 
01:25:41.910 --> 01:25:41.920 align:start position:0%
them especially as it relates to the
 
01:25:44.470 --> 01:25:44.480 align:start position:0%
funding timing and approval process
 
01:25:47.030 --> 01:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
through the fiscal committee Etc and
 
01:25:48.790 --> 01:25:48.800 align:start position:0%
just as presidential Declaration of
 
01:25:51.149 --> 01:25:51.159 align:start position:0%
emergency is the trigger for federal
 
01:25:53.189 --> 01:25:53.199 align:start position:0%
funds to be made available able I'm
 
01:25:54.550 --> 01:25:54.560 align:start position:0%
proposing that the commissioner of
 
01:25:57.430 --> 01:25:57.440 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety declare a natural
 
01:25:59.709 --> 01:25:59.719 align:start position:0%
disaster in the state which would allow
 
01:26:01.470 --> 01:26:01.480 align:start position:0%
municipalities to apply for grant
 
01:26:03.310 --> 01:26:03.320 align:start position:0%
funding from the existing emergency
 
01:26:05.910 --> 01:26:05.920 align:start position:0%
response and Recovery Fund that's in RSA
 
01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:08.149 align:start position:0%
response and Recovery Fund that's in RSA
21-

01:26:08.149 --> 01:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
21-
 
01:26:11.830 --> 01:26:11.840 align:start position:0%
p46 this bill amends that RSA to include
 
01:26:13.830 --> 01:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
municipalities to be able to access
 
01:26:16.350 --> 01:26:16.360 align:start position:0%
funding we can put money into this fund
 
01:26:18.629 --> 01:26:18.639 align:start position:0%
from our rainy day fund it would go a
 
01:26:20.669 --> 01:26:20.679 align:start position:0%
long way to help municipalities get back
 
01:26:22.790 --> 01:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
on their feet more quickly than waiting
 
01:26:24.430 --> 01:26:24.440 align:start position:0%
months and years for anything to come
 
01:26:26.910 --> 01:26:26.920 align:start position:0%
from the federal government FEA
 
01:26:29.070 --> 01:26:29.080 align:start position:0%
reimbursement program I've put some
 
01:26:30.350 --> 01:26:30.360 align:start position:0%
Provisions in the bill which would
 
01:26:32.229 --> 01:26:32.239 align:start position:0%
ensure that only towns with significant
 
01:26:34.430 --> 01:26:34.440 align:start position:0%
damage and with limited resources can
 
01:26:37.510 --> 01:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
get assistance as for the notion that if
 
01:26:39.790 --> 01:26:39.800 align:start position:0%
a town gets State grant money they may
 
01:26:42.390 --> 01:26:42.400 align:start position:0%
be ineligible to receive FEMA
 
01:26:44.709 --> 01:26:44.719 align:start position:0%
funding I can tell you that towns I
 
01:26:46.590 --> 01:26:46.600 align:start position:0%
represent are tired and disgusted in
 
01:26:48.430 --> 01:26:48.440 align:start position:0%
working with femma it's been a
 
01:26:50.669 --> 01:26:50.679 align:start position:0%
bureaucratic Nightmare and they don't
 
01:26:52.470 --> 01:26:52.480 align:start position:0%
get back nearly as much money as is they
 
01:26:54.910 --> 01:26:54.920 align:start position:0%
put in claims for they simply don't have
 
01:26:58.070 --> 01:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
the town staff or time to deal with FEMA
 
01:26:59.550 --> 01:26:59.560 align:start position:0%
they're telling me that they would much
 
01:27:01.350 --> 01:27:01.360 align:start position:0%
rather have a state program in place to
 
01:27:03.470 --> 01:27:03.480 align:start position:0%
help them and they feel it would be more
 
01:27:06.149 --> 01:27:06.159 align:start position:0%
expedient and efficient other states do
 
01:27:08.830 --> 01:27:08.840 align:start position:0%
this and I would also add that with the
 
01:27:10.790 --> 01:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
very poor response time of FEMA
 
01:27:13.510 --> 01:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
reimbursement and the overall horrendous
 
01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:14.629 align:start position:0%
reimbursement and the overall horrendous
FEMA

01:27:14.629 --> 01:27:14.639 align:start position:0%
FEMA
 
01:27:18.430 --> 01:27:18.440 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy um we need to change this
 
01:27:20.270 --> 01:27:20.280 align:start position:0%
FEMA has made statements about their
 
01:27:22.750 --> 01:27:22.760 align:start position:0%
programs running low on funds so the
 
01:27:24.510 --> 01:27:24.520 align:start position:0%
wait times might be even longer in the
 
01:27:30.109 --> 01:27:30.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:34.030 --> 01:27:34.040 align:start position:0%
them as for the notion
 
01:27:37.229 --> 01:27:37.239 align:start position:0%
um oh wait a state program like what I'm
 
01:27:40.109 --> 01:27:40.119 align:start position:0%
proposing is by In This bipartisan bill
 
01:27:41.830 --> 01:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
would go a long way to helping a small
 
01:27:43.709 --> 01:27:43.719 align:start position:0%
town with little resources to begin to
 
01:27:45.990 --> 01:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
rebuild after a natural disaster and
 
01:27:47.990 --> 01:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
make roads and other infrastructure safe
 
01:27:50.430 --> 01:27:50.440 align:start position:0%
for its citizens and businesses so I
 
01:27:51.910 --> 01:27:51.920 align:start position:0%
hope that you'll consider what I present
 
01:27:54.310 --> 01:27:54.320 align:start position:0%
today today it's time we allow the state
 
01:27:56.470 --> 01:27:56.480 align:start position:0%
to step in to help a municipality in
 
01:27:59.350 --> 01:27:59.360 align:start position:0%
time of need I asked also that you look
 
01:28:01.590 --> 01:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
over the link that I sent to you all via
 
01:28:04.430 --> 01:28:04.440 align:start position:0%
email a report from the Pew trust about
 
01:28:07.109 --> 01:28:07.119 align:start position:0%
how States pay for natural disasters in
 
01:28:09.550 --> 01:28:09.560 align:start position:0%
this era of rising costs it's
 
01:28:11.629 --> 01:28:11.639 align:start position:0%
Illuminating to see how poorly New
 
01:28:14.470 --> 01:28:14.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire fares against other states and
 
01:28:16.629 --> 01:28:16.639 align:start position:0%
lastly reports indicate that the
 
01:28:18.470 --> 01:28:18.480 align:start position:0%
expenditures for the Federal Emergency
 
01:28:20.830 --> 01:28:20.840 align:start position:0%
Management agency's public assistance
 
01:28:22.390 --> 01:28:22.400 align:start position:0%
program which municipality seek
 
01:28:24.590 --> 01:28:24.600 align:start position:0%
reimbursement from after a natural
 
01:28:27.790 --> 01:28:27.800 align:start position:0%
disaster alone increased by 23% When
 
01:28:29.910 --> 01:28:29.920 align:start position:0%
comparing the
 
01:28:34.149 --> 01:28:34.159 align:start position:0%
20209 and 2010 to 2019 decades the
 
01:28:36.390 --> 01:28:36.400 align:start position:0%
federal government as a whole spent at
 
01:28:39.790 --> 01:28:39.800 align:start position:0%
least $460 billion on disaster costs
 
01:28:43.750 --> 01:28:43.760 align:start position:0%
from 2005 to 2019 we're already hearing
 
01:28:45.189 --> 01:28:45.199 align:start position:0%
that FEMA is beginning to run out of
 
01:28:47.229 --> 01:28:47.239 align:start position:0%
reimbursement money and they're backing
 
01:28:49.870 --> 01:28:49.880 align:start position:0%
away from funding reimbursement requests
 
01:28:51.669 --> 01:28:51.679 align:start position:0%
as a state we have to be prepared to
 
01:28:54.590 --> 01:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
help ourselves we should start that
 
01:28:57.390 --> 01:28:57.400 align:start position:0%
process and I thank you appreciate your
 
01:29:01.350 --> 01:29:01.360 align:start position:0%
time and I'm open for any
 
01:29:03.910 --> 01:29:03.920 align:start position:0%
questions thank
 
01:29:06.510 --> 01:29:06.520 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
01:29:09.229 --> 01:29:09.239 align:start position:0%
Shu thank you madam chair thank you
 
01:29:12.990 --> 01:29:13.000 align:start position:0%
representative Aaron um I'm curious um
 
01:29:16.550 --> 01:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
if at any point during this um these two
 
01:29:19.950 --> 01:29:19.960 align:start position:0%
floods particularly if either your town
 
01:29:22.229 --> 01:29:22.239 align:start position:0%
or you as a representative your town of
 
01:29:24.270 --> 01:29:24.280 align:start position:0%
your town reached out to our
 
01:29:26.390 --> 01:29:26.400 align:start position:0%
Congressional Delegation to see if they
 
01:29:30.149 --> 01:29:30.159 align:start position:0%
could accelerate uh FEMA and Homeland
 
01:29:34.470 --> 01:29:34.480 align:start position:0%
Security response yes we have and they
 
01:29:36.709 --> 01:29:36.719 align:start position:0%
haven't been able to do anything thank
 
01:29:40.629 --> 01:29:40.639 align:start position:0%
you and um I mean to their credit down
 
01:29:42.590 --> 01:29:42.600 align:start position:0%
in uh New Hampshire Homeland Security
 
01:29:44.709 --> 01:29:44.719 align:start position:0%
emergency management director Rob
 
01:29:47.510 --> 01:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
buckton has been incredible he's been
 
01:29:50.910 --> 01:29:50.920 align:start position:0%
doing a lot of work to help um run
 
01:29:50.920 --> 01:29:52.830 align:start position:0%
doing a lot of work to help um run
interference

01:29:52.830 --> 01:29:52.840 align:start position:0%
interference
 
01:29:55.070 --> 01:29:55.080 align:start position:0%
with between the municipality and
 
01:29:58.390 --> 01:29:58.400 align:start position:0%
between FEMA uh and trying to get
 
01:30:01.629 --> 01:30:01.639 align:start position:0%
FEMA you know they they had a lot of PE
 
01:30:03.430 --> 01:30:03.440 align:start position:0%
they've changed the way they do things
 
01:30:07.470 --> 01:30:07.480 align:start position:0%
too and they they had a constant bunch
 
01:30:11.390 --> 01:30:11.400 align:start position:0%
of people in and out of the project so
 
01:30:13.790 --> 01:30:13.800 align:start position:0%
there was always we always had to spend
 
01:30:15.950 --> 01:30:15.960 align:start position:0%
time bringing people up to speed which
 
01:30:19.149 --> 01:30:19.159 align:start position:0%
was a waste of time too we gave them
 
01:30:22.149 --> 01:30:22.159 align:start position:0%
documentation that they lost three four
 
01:30:23.390 --> 01:30:23.400 align:start position:0%
five six
 
01:30:26.910 --> 01:30:26.920 align:start position:0%
times um it's just been miserable to
 
01:30:29.430 --> 01:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
work with them but again I would say
 
01:30:31.669 --> 01:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
director buckton has also done a really
 
01:30:34.229 --> 01:30:34.239 align:start position:0%
good job in so far as a lot of the rules
 
01:30:38.189 --> 01:30:38.199 align:start position:0%
that FEMA uh has us follow or
 
01:30:39.950 --> 01:30:39.960 align:start position:0%
information that they are requesting
 
01:30:39.960 --> 01:30:41.109 align:start position:0%
information that they are requesting
from

01:30:41.109 --> 01:30:41.119 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:30:45.270 --> 01:30:45.280 align:start position:0%
us SI simply is just not
 
01:30:49.149 --> 01:30:49.159 align:start position:0%
um it's difficult for or even impossible
 
01:30:50.950 --> 01:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
for municipality to provide that
 
01:30:50.960 --> 01:30:52.470 align:start position:0%
for municipality to provide that
information

01:30:52.470 --> 01:30:52.480 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:30:55.030 --> 01:30:55.040 align:start position:0%
and so he has tried in various ways to
 
01:30:58.149 --> 01:30:58.159 align:start position:0%
get exemptions when we are required to
 
01:31:00.390 --> 01:31:00.400 align:start position:0%
give certain documents or certain
 
01:31:04.470 --> 01:31:04.480 align:start position:0%
information whatever and so he's done a
 
01:31:06.790 --> 01:31:06.800 align:start position:0%
really good job in trying to accelerate
 
01:31:08.709 --> 01:31:08.719 align:start position:0%
accelerate the process and also trying
 
01:31:11.149 --> 01:31:11.159 align:start position:0%
to find ways in which we may be exempt
 
01:31:12.510 --> 01:31:12.520 align:start position:0%
from certain things that they're asking
 
01:31:15.790 --> 01:31:15.800 align:start position:0%
for so yes I mean we've tried what we
 
01:31:19.950 --> 01:31:19.960 align:start position:0%
can to help move things along but it's a
 
01:31:23.149 --> 01:31:23.159 align:start position:0%
huge bureaucracy aworth and towns in New
 
01:31:25.070 --> 01:31:25.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire who have experienced flooding
 
01:31:27.750 --> 01:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
are not the only ones who are requesting
 
01:31:30.350 --> 01:31:30.360 align:start position:0%
reimbursement from FEMA we have all
 
01:31:32.310 --> 01:31:32.320 align:start position:0%
kinds of disasters and things happening
 
01:31:34.910 --> 01:31:34.920 align:start position:0%
all over the country and I have to tell
 
01:31:34.920 --> 01:31:37.109 align:start position:0%
all over the country and I have to tell
you

01:31:37.109 --> 01:31:37.119 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:31:41.990 --> 01:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
too um I a couple of months ago I had um
 
01:31:43.709 --> 01:31:43.719 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to speak with Governor
 
01:31:46.870 --> 01:31:46.880 align:start position:0%
Ronda santis of Florida and I spoke to
 
01:31:49.270 --> 01:31:49.280 align:start position:0%
him and asked him because Florida gets
 
01:31:52.270 --> 01:31:52.280 align:start position:0%
hit with uh disasters all the time
 
01:31:55.629 --> 01:31:55.639 align:start position:0%
and I asked him so what does your state
 
01:31:58.310 --> 01:31:58.320 align:start position:0%
do do you do you help municipalities do
 
01:32:01.270 --> 01:32:01.280 align:start position:0%
you help individuals what how do you how
 
01:32:03.990 --> 01:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
do you handle this he said well we got
 
01:32:06.990 --> 01:32:07.000 align:start position:0%
tired of waiting for FEMA and granted
 
01:32:08.669 --> 01:32:08.679 align:start position:0%
it's Florida it's a much bigger State
 
01:32:10.910 --> 01:32:10.920 align:start position:0%
than New Hampshire but he said we set up
 
01:32:14.149 --> 01:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
our own $500 million fund and when
 
01:32:15.390 --> 01:32:15.400 align:start position:0%
there's a bridge that needs to be
 
01:32:18.270 --> 01:32:18.280 align:start position:0%
replaced after a hurricane or something
 
01:32:19.910 --> 01:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
we take money out of that fund and we
 
01:32:22.550 --> 01:32:22.560 align:start position:0%
replace it right away especially if it's
 
01:32:26.109 --> 01:32:26.119 align:start position:0%
in a highly trafficked area or very
 
01:32:29.669 --> 01:32:29.679 align:start position:0%
important to Commerce he said if we need
 
01:32:33.149 --> 01:32:33.159 align:start position:0%
housing for people to live in like an RV
 
01:32:35.470 --> 01:32:35.480 align:start position:0%
or some other um
 
01:32:39.750 --> 01:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
small um house or something we provide
 
01:32:42.470 --> 01:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
that funding for those families while
 
01:32:45.149 --> 01:32:45.159 align:start position:0%
their house is being rebuilt so there
 
01:32:48.350 --> 01:32:48.360 align:start position:0%
are states and and in this Pew report
 
01:32:51.669 --> 01:32:51.679 align:start position:0%
that I um I sent you the link to it it
 
01:32:54.709 --> 01:32:54.719 align:start position:0%
it shows that different states handle
 
01:32:57.390 --> 01:32:57.400 align:start position:0%
these natural disasters differently in
 
01:33:00.149 --> 01:33:00.159 align:start position:0%
terms of the way they fund um they may
 
01:33:01.990 --> 01:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
have reimbursement programs Grant
 
01:33:04.189 --> 01:33:04.199 align:start position:0%
programs loan programs there's all
 
01:33:06.229 --> 01:33:06.239 align:start position:0%
different kinds of things that are
 
01:33:08.109 --> 01:33:08.119 align:start position:0%
offered to the municipalities and the
 
01:33:10.910 --> 01:33:10.920 align:start position:0%
citizens of their states and I find that
 
01:33:12.950 --> 01:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is sorely lacking in that
 
01:33:16.590 --> 01:33:16.600 align:start position:0%
we have completely put ourselves um to
 
01:33:18.390 --> 01:33:18.400 align:start position:0%
depend on FEMA
 
01:33:20.750 --> 01:33:20.760 align:start position:0%
reimbursement and while like I said sp
 
01:33:24.030 --> 01:33:24.040 align:start position:0%
sp 409 allows for a loan
 
01:33:28.350 --> 01:33:28.360 align:start position:0%
program that is also um a
 
01:33:31.910 --> 01:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
time time um
 
01:33:34.750 --> 01:33:34.760 align:start position:0%
sensitive process you have to wait a
 
01:33:36.350 --> 01:33:36.360 align:start position:0%
couple of months before you can have a
 
01:33:39.070 --> 01:33:39.080 align:start position:0%
special election to get a loan it's not
 
01:33:42.109 --> 01:33:42.119 align:start position:0%
like the um select board in your town
 
01:33:43.870 --> 01:33:43.880 align:start position:0%
can say oh we're going to go take a loan
 
01:33:46.030 --> 01:33:46.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to go get money they can't
 
01:33:49.189 --> 01:33:49.199 align:start position:0%
do that without the voters saying
 
01:33:53.990 --> 01:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
so okay I have so two questions sure the
 
01:33:56.870 --> 01:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
first one is that it looks as though the
 
01:33:58.709 --> 01:33:58.719 align:start position:0%
department of safety requires five
 
01:34:00.350 --> 01:34:00.360 align:start position:0%
people to implement
 
01:34:00.360 --> 01:34:02.030 align:start position:0%
people to implement
this

01:34:02.030 --> 01:34:02.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:34:05.030 --> 01:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
um is was that your intention and if so
 
01:34:09.149 --> 01:34:09.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:14.390 --> 01:34:14.400 align:start position:0%
it well you know I hadn't uh I I hadn't
 
01:34:17.470 --> 01:34:17.480 align:start position:0%
talked to Department of Safety as to
 
01:34:19.390 --> 01:34:19.400 align:start position:0%
whether or not you know what they would
 
01:34:22.070 --> 01:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
need in terms of resources to Implement
 
01:34:23.109 --> 01:34:23.119 align:start position:0%
such a
 
01:34:27.350 --> 01:34:27.360 align:start position:0%
program but I don't know how they need
 
01:34:29.990 --> 01:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
five people to do that I mean you have
 
01:34:33.149 --> 01:34:33.159 align:start position:0%
the the commissioner who can see they
 
01:34:36.510 --> 01:34:36.520 align:start position:0%
already have people in uh New Hampshire
 
01:34:38.629 --> 01:34:38.639 align:start position:0%
Homeland Security emergency management
 
01:34:41.510 --> 01:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
that work on these
 
01:34:43.790 --> 01:34:43.800 align:start position:0%
disasters I don't know how they would
 
01:34:46.109 --> 01:34:46.119 align:start position:0%
need five more people to implement any
 
01:34:50.430 --> 01:34:50.440 align:start position:0%
kind of grant program to help towns okay
 
01:34:52.910 --> 01:34:52.920 align:start position:0%
thank you the other question question is
 
01:34:55.629 --> 01:34:55.639 align:start position:0%
as was pointed out in the fiscal note
 
01:34:57.870 --> 01:34:57.880 align:start position:0%
that you required the department of
 
01:35:00.709 --> 01:35:00.719 align:start position:0%
safety to make emergency funds available
 
01:35:04.990 --> 01:35:05.000 align:start position:0%
within 24 hours after approval of fiscal
 
01:35:07.669 --> 01:35:07.679 align:start position:0%
which meets once a month yeah I saw that
 
01:35:09.470 --> 01:35:09.480 align:start position:0%
and that's I that's something that I
 
01:35:11.790 --> 01:35:11.800 align:start position:0%
would need to fix in this bill um
 
01:35:15.189 --> 01:35:15.199 align:start position:0%
perhaps we wouldn't have to go prob
 
01:35:18.830 --> 01:35:18.840 align:start position:0%
perhaps the uh the director of Homeland
 
01:35:21.430 --> 01:35:21.440 align:start position:0%
Security emergency management can
 
01:35:23.229 --> 01:35:23.239 align:start position:0%
anticipate how much funding he may need
 
01:35:26.830 --> 01:35:26.840 align:start position:0%
to put into this existing fund and go to
 
01:35:29.390 --> 01:35:29.400 align:start position:0%
fiscal and have that
 
01:35:32.629 --> 01:35:32.639 align:start position:0%
funded and then having the money in the
 
01:35:34.910 --> 01:35:34.920 align:start position:0%
fund we can make those funds available
 
01:35:37.510 --> 01:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
to municipalities right away you
 
01:35:38.709 --> 01:35:38.719 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to go through fiscal
 
01:35:41.070 --> 01:35:41.080 align:start position:0%
committee for that so I think there's a
 
01:35:43.669 --> 01:35:43.679 align:start position:0%
there's an element in the bill here that
 
01:35:46.709 --> 01:35:46.719 align:start position:0%
I do need to fix and I don't know if I
 
01:35:46.719 --> 01:35:47.590 align:start position:0%
I do need to fix and I don't know if I
do

01:35:47.590 --> 01:35:47.600 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:35:50.270 --> 01:35:50.280 align:start position:0%
that within this committee here or if
 
01:35:52.590 --> 01:35:52.600 align:start position:0%
this goes off to finance
 
01:35:55.270 --> 01:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
after I'm not sure how that concerned
 
01:35:58.189 --> 01:35:58.199 align:start position:0%
about that and I'm I would be very
 
01:36:00.550 --> 01:36:00.560 align:start position:0%
concerned if you tried to fix it so that
 
01:36:03.550 --> 01:36:03.560 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of emerg of Homeland
 
01:36:06.310 --> 01:36:06.320 align:start position:0%
Security could had a multi-million
 
01:36:08.870 --> 01:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
dollar fund he could just give away to
 
01:36:11.709 --> 01:36:11.719 align:start position:0%
towns without any
 
01:36:14.030 --> 01:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
oversight I get that and that's
 
01:36:16.910 --> 01:36:16.920 align:start position:0%
something I'd be willing to work with um
 
01:36:19.189 --> 01:36:19.199 align:start position:0%
someone from fiscal or someone from
 
01:36:22.270 --> 01:36:22.280 align:start position:0%
finance committee to fix in this Bill
 
01:36:24.550 --> 01:36:24.560 align:start position:0%
okay thank you because I think you know
 
01:36:27.310 --> 01:36:27.320 align:start position:0%
we have a fund that's there it does as
 
01:36:29.229 --> 01:36:29.239 align:start position:0%
far as I know right now there's only
 
01:36:33.950 --> 01:36:33.960 align:start position:0%
$45,000 in it and um I think if we have
 
01:36:36.629 --> 01:36:36.639 align:start position:0%
a fund we ought to make some put some
 
01:36:38.109 --> 01:36:38.119 align:start position:0%
money in it and make some grants
 
01:36:40.270 --> 01:36:40.280 align:start position:0%
available to municipalities who really
 
01:36:42.109 --> 01:36:42.119 align:start position:0%
need it in their time of
 
01:36:46.109 --> 01:36:46.119 align:start position:0%
need okay um this will be going to
 
01:36:47.990 --> 01:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
representative shu's
 
01:36:52.430 --> 01:36:52.440 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and we will um um since
 
01:36:55.430 --> 01:36:55.440 align:start position:0%
it's an early Bill we need to meet soon
 
01:36:58.149 --> 01:36:58.159 align:start position:0%
because it has to be exact by the middle
 
01:37:01.350 --> 01:37:01.360 align:start position:0%
of February okay but I'd be willing to
 
01:37:04.270 --> 01:37:04.280 align:start position:0%
sit down and you know work through that
 
01:37:06.669 --> 01:37:06.679 align:start position:0%
that timing issue and um money
 
01:37:09.870 --> 01:37:09.880 align:start position:0%
allocation issue okay yes I those are
 
01:37:13.149 --> 01:37:13.159 align:start position:0%
issues y okay any other questions
 
01:37:15.590 --> 01:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt thank you madam
 
01:37:19.590 --> 01:37:19.600 align:start position:0%
chair well I I I I was a moment late in
 
01:37:22.189 --> 01:37:22.199 align:start position:0%
coming back into the room so I missed
 
01:37:25.390 --> 01:37:25.400 align:start position:0%
something at the very beginning of your
 
01:37:25.400 --> 01:37:26.229 align:start position:0%
something at the very beginning of your
uh

01:37:26.229 --> 01:37:26.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:37:31.189 --> 01:37:31.199 align:start position:0%
testimony uh but um I I
 
01:37:35.510 --> 01:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
recall looking around uh I think maybe
 
01:37:37.870 --> 01:37:37.880 align:start position:0%
representative Shu was here at the time
 
01:37:41.470 --> 01:37:41.480 align:start position:0%
but when alad had the infamous flood
 
01:37:45.589 --> 01:37:45.599 align:start position:0%
about 18 years ago I think um it was
 
01:37:47.870 --> 01:37:47.880 align:start position:0%
actually during the off season I think
 
01:37:50.589 --> 01:37:50.599 align:start position:0%
it was like in the in July or August or
 
01:37:52.910 --> 01:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
something like that and I mean the
 
01:37:55.750 --> 01:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
center of town was just ripped out by
 
01:37:59.790 --> 01:37:59.800 align:start position:0%
the the river getting damned up and then
 
01:38:03.550 --> 01:38:03.560 align:start position:0%
the the the the that dam broke if you
 
01:38:05.910 --> 01:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
will and it it just ripped the center of
 
01:38:08.669 --> 01:38:08.679 align:start position:0%
town completely out but we had a special
 
01:38:11.510 --> 01:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
session and we we took action very
 
01:38:14.070 --> 01:38:14.080 align:start position:0%
quickly that was under Governor Lynch uh
 
01:38:17.709 --> 01:38:17.719 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering uh this is clearly a
 
01:38:21.470 --> 01:38:21.480 align:start position:0%
major issue and a FEMA has been so I me
 
01:38:25.910 --> 01:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
functionally derelict um in and acting
 
01:38:30.430 --> 01:38:30.440 align:start position:0%
on behalf of aor um then we got to do
 
01:38:33.589 --> 01:38:33.599 align:start position:0%
something so uh the the idea of a more
 
01:38:36.149 --> 01:38:36.159 align:start position:0%
coordinated and expanded effort I think
 
01:38:38.750 --> 01:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
is appropriate so seems like the
 
01:38:42.229 --> 01:38:42.239 align:start position:0%
subcommittee the chairs selected is
 
01:38:45.229 --> 01:38:45.239 align:start position:0%
going to be helpful for that so um and
 
01:38:46.870 --> 01:38:46.880 align:start position:0%
you you already indicated that you're
 
01:38:50.830 --> 01:38:50.840 align:start position:0%
willing to make some changes to so yeah
 
01:38:53.149 --> 01:38:53.159 align:start position:0%
good okay and I might add you know this
 
01:38:56.589 --> 01:38:56.599 align:start position:0%
isn't just an aworth issue we've seen
 
01:38:59.669 --> 01:38:59.679 align:start position:0%
just in this past July 2023 floods a lot
 
01:39:03.390 --> 01:39:03.400 align:start position:0%
more um municipalities were hit with
 
01:39:05.950 --> 01:39:05.960 align:start position:0%
severe flooding and problems with their
 
01:39:09.990 --> 01:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
infrastructure um so I think that it's
 
01:39:14.750 --> 01:39:14.760 align:start position:0%
time that we we look as a at a state to
 
01:39:17.430 --> 01:39:17.440 align:start position:0%
be a little bit more serious about um
 
01:39:19.550 --> 01:39:19.560 align:start position:0%
taking on some of the responsibilities
 
01:39:22.870 --> 01:39:22.880 align:start position:0%
of helping the these towns through this
 
01:39:24.990 --> 01:39:25.000 align:start position:0%
and while home Homeland Security
 
01:39:26.669 --> 01:39:26.679 align:start position:0%
emergency management in New Hampshire
 
01:39:29.589 --> 01:39:29.599 align:start position:0%
has been really great in um their
 
01:39:32.790 --> 01:39:32.800 align:start position:0%
response in helping us and guiding us
 
01:39:36.830 --> 01:39:36.840 align:start position:0%
through the whole bureaucratic um moras
 
01:39:40.629 --> 01:39:40.639 align:start position:0%
from FEMA um I think if we could do
 
01:39:43.030 --> 01:39:43.040 align:start position:0%
something simpler and more expedient for
 
01:39:45.470 --> 01:39:45.480 align:start position:0%
ourselves in the state that would be to
 
01:39:48.629 --> 01:39:48.639 align:start position:0%
our credit I mean
 
01:39:52.550 --> 01:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
um you know events like
 
01:39:55.470 --> 01:39:55.480 align:start position:0%
this though are they're hardest on our
 
01:39:58.430 --> 01:39:58.440 align:start position:0%
smallest towns that have small tax bases
 
01:39:59.750 --> 01:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
and limited
 
01:40:02.149 --> 01:40:02.159 align:start position:0%
resources and you know I believe New
 
01:40:03.950 --> 01:40:03.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire spirit is to lend a helping
 
01:40:07.189 --> 01:40:07.199 align:start position:0%
hand where it's needed so I I would hope
 
01:40:08.990 --> 01:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
that we can do
 
01:40:11.350 --> 01:40:11.360 align:start position:0%
something I certainly think it's a it's
 
01:40:14.149 --> 01:40:14.159 align:start position:0%
worth a uh concerted effort to see if we
 
01:40:16.950 --> 01:40:16.960 align:start position:0%
can't improve the mechanism of
 
01:40:18.830 --> 01:40:18.840 align:start position:0%
addressing these issues as opposed to
 
01:40:20.629 --> 01:40:20.639 align:start position:0%
kind of waiting for the FED federal
 
01:40:22.430 --> 01:40:22.440 align:start position:0%
government has got a much much deeper
 
01:40:24.510 --> 01:40:24.520 align:start position:0%
pockets of course we all know that but
 
01:40:26.790 --> 01:40:26.800 align:start position:0%
but to the degree that it's it's not a
 
01:40:30.950 --> 01:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
very functional or Speedy uh resolution
 
01:40:34.030 --> 01:40:34.040 align:start position:0%
of the issue we got to try something so
 
01:40:37.070 --> 01:40:37.080 align:start position:0%
and I I had had um discussions with
 
01:40:41.149 --> 01:40:41.159 align:start position:0%
representative Wier from finance and he
 
01:40:43.589 --> 01:40:43.599 align:start position:0%
uh he indicated to me when I was asking
 
01:40:45.550 --> 01:40:45.560 align:start position:0%
you know does a state have funding to do
 
01:40:48.109 --> 01:40:48.119 align:start position:0%
this he said I could give you $4 million
 
01:40:51.149 --> 01:40:51.159 align:start position:0%
tomorrow and allocate that funds for you
 
01:40:53.910 --> 01:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
but there's no statutory mechanism to do
 
01:40:56.310 --> 01:40:56.320 align:start position:0%
it and I kept hearing that from the
 
01:40:58.070 --> 01:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
governor's office I kept hearing that
 
01:41:02.790 --> 01:41:02.800 align:start position:0%
from the Senators Jeb Senator Bradley um
 
01:41:05.030 --> 01:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
there's just no statutory mechanism
 
01:41:08.430 --> 01:41:08.440 align:start position:0%
other than the loan process which again
 
01:41:11.430 --> 01:41:11.440 align:start position:0%
is very limited because a town can only
 
01:41:14.229 --> 01:41:14.239 align:start position:0%
take out a loan for as much as they are
 
01:41:16.790 --> 01:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
uh they're available to do based on what
 
01:41:20.070 --> 01:41:20.080 align:start position:0%
their assets are and everything else uh
 
01:41:23.430 --> 01:41:23.440 align:start position:0%
and and the process is more lengthy it
 
01:41:25.470 --> 01:41:25.480 align:start position:0%
takes a couple of months to get a a
 
01:41:27.950 --> 01:41:27.960 align:start position:0%
special uh town meeting
 
01:41:31.510 --> 01:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
going okay thank you is there anyone
 
01:41:36.070 --> 01:41:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:38.430 --> 01:41:38.440 align:start position:0%
1466 all right seeing none thank you
 
01:41:40.470 --> 01:41:40.480 align:start position:0%
representative Aaron thank you so much
 
01:41:42.430 --> 01:41:42.440 align:start position:0%
for taking the time and listening to me

subcommittee and coming up with uh
 
01:41:48.709 --> 01:41:48.719 align:start position:0%
something that's more fiscally uh
 
01:41:51.390 --> 01:41:51.400 align:start position:0%
workable okay Madam chair if I
 
01:41:54.629 --> 01:41:54.639 align:start position:0%
just add uh since both your community

and mine were involved in the famous
 
01:42:00.790 --> 01:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
Mother's Day aulion for our towns and
 
01:42:03.390 --> 01:42:03.400 align:start position:0%
neighboring towns uh we're very
 
01:42:05.270 --> 01:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
sympathetic to this and I hope we can
 
01:42:07.950 --> 01:42:07.960 align:start position:0%
get something worked out okay okay thank
 
01:42:10.390 --> 01:42:10.400 align:start position:0%
you very much all right in that case I'm
 
01:42:12.430 --> 01:42:12.440 align:start position:0%
going to close the hearing we're due
 
01:42:15.550 --> 01:42:15.560 align:start position:0%

brials yum yes exactly get your lunch
 
01:42:19.760 --> 01:42:23.270 align:start position:0%
brials yum yes exactly get your lunch
first

01:42:23.270 --> 01:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:25.430 --> 01:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
and this will this will be going going
 
01:42:25.440 --> 01:42:49.750 align:start position:0%
and this will this will be going going
to

01:42:49.750 --> 01:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:49.760 --> 03:17:39.910 align:start position:0%
 
subcommittee

03:17:39.910 --> 03:17:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:44.070 --> 03:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
I'm opening the hearing on House Bill
 
03:17:48.510 --> 03:17:48.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:53.229 --> 03:17:53.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:56.910 --> 03:17:56.920 align:start position:0%
montine uh hello I'm Jessica lontine a
 
03:17:58.870 --> 03:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
representative from
 
03:18:02.189 --> 03:18:02.199 align:start position:0%
do and I thank you for letting me
 
03:18:03.990 --> 03:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
present here
 
03:18:07.389 --> 03:18:07.399 align:start position:0%
today I I want to talk about how uh this
 
03:18:11.349 --> 03:18:11.359 align:start position:0%
bill came into being briefly and also go
 
03:18:15.150 --> 03:18:15.160 align:start position:0%
over some of the basic concepts about
 
03:18:17.110 --> 03:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
green burials and natural organic
 
03:18:20.309 --> 03:18:20.319 align:start position:0%
reduction as well as general practices
 
03:18:23.950 --> 03:18:23.960 align:start position:0%
we have about burial and death
 
03:18:28.150 --> 03:18:28.160 align:start position:0%
care um so I first uh started thinking
 
03:18:31.710 --> 03:18:31.720 align:start position:0%
about this because last friend a uh last
 
03:18:34.510 --> 03:18:34.520 align:start position:0%
spring a good family friend passed away
 
03:18:34.520 --> 03:18:35.630 align:start position:0%
spring a good family friend passed away
in

03:18:35.630 --> 03:18:35.640 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:18:38.469 --> 03:18:38.479 align:start position:0%
Vermont and he had already made himself
 
03:18:42.269 --> 03:18:42.279 align:start position:0%
a pine casket and one for his wife and
 
03:18:45.150 --> 03:18:45.160 align:start position:0%
he was buried on his own land in a very
 
03:18:46.950 --> 03:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
remote place of
 
03:18:50.229 --> 03:18:50.239 align:start position:0%
Vermont and I found that to be such a
 
03:18:53.309 --> 03:18:53.319 align:start position:0%
moving experience and it got me thinking
 
03:18:54.469 --> 03:18:54.479 align:start position:0%
a lot
 
03:18:57.630 --> 03:18:57.640 align:start position:0%
about my own family's experience with
 
03:19:01.389 --> 03:19:01.399 align:start position:0%
how we've handled death my grandparents
 
03:19:06.309 --> 03:19:06.319 align:start position:0%
had open casket wakes and were in bombed
 
03:19:08.429 --> 03:19:08.439 align:start position:0%
and I remember as a child that that was
 
03:19:11.030 --> 03:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
not a positive experience for
 
03:19:16.030 --> 03:19:16.040 align:start position:0%
me and both my parents have opted for
 
03:19:18.150 --> 03:19:18.160 align:start position:0%
cremation and I hadn't really thought
 
03:19:20.710 --> 03:19:20.720 align:start position:0%
much about what I would like for myself
 
03:19:23.670 --> 03:19:23.680 align:start position:0%
and most of us don't it's not a subject
 
03:19:26.590 --> 03:19:26.600 align:start position:0%
that is talked about
 
03:19:29.150 --> 03:19:29.160 align:start position:0%
though we will all have
 
03:19:32.510 --> 03:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
to experience that
 
03:19:36.189 --> 03:19:36.199 align:start position:0%
ultimately um but what at this friend's
 
03:19:39.910 --> 03:19:39.920 align:start position:0%
funeral um our mutual friend said oh you
 
03:19:41.710 --> 03:19:41.720 align:start position:0%
know Jeff worked really hard to change
 
03:19:44.870 --> 03:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
thew laws in Vermont so that he could
 
03:19:47.189 --> 03:19:47.199 align:start position:0%
have this green burial and I thought
 
03:19:49.070 --> 03:19:49.080 align:start position:0%
well I'm a State Rep I think I'm going
 
03:19:52.070 --> 03:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
to look at what the laws are in New
 
03:19:54.349 --> 03:19:54.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and so I've done a lot of
 
03:19:57.590 --> 03:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
research and talking about it talking
 
03:20:00.389 --> 03:20:00.399 align:start position:0%
about it with um my
 
03:20:02.870 --> 03:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
colleagues and so a lot of them are here
 
03:20:04.910 --> 03:20:04.920 align:start position:0%
today I was worked especially hard with
 
03:20:08.229 --> 03:20:08.239 align:start position:0%
will uh Darby and Allison knob on this
 
03:20:10.510 --> 03:20:10.520 align:start position:0%
project and they're both here
 
03:20:12.910 --> 03:20:12.920 align:start position:0%
today so
 
03:20:16.990 --> 03:20:17.000 align:start position:0%
and that's how the um it evolved to also
 
03:20:19.150 --> 03:20:19.160 align:start position:0%
include natural organic reduction not
 
03:20:20.670 --> 03:20:20.680 align:start position:0%
just green
 
03:20:24.189 --> 03:20:24.199 align:start position:0%
barrial so I chose to have a slideshow
 
03:20:26.630 --> 03:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
because you know pictures can hopefully
 
03:20:30.030 --> 03:20:30.040 align:start position:0%
save us a lot of words well but why why
 
03:20:31.910 --> 03:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
have a build on green burials in natural
 
03:20:33.830 --> 03:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
organic reduction there's growing
 
03:20:36.030 --> 03:20:36.040 align:start position:0%
interest in alternatives to Conventional
 
03:20:37.670 --> 03:20:37.680 align:start position:0%
burials and
 
03:20:40.189 --> 03:20:40.199 align:start position:0%
cremation their green burial and natural
 
03:20:41.990 --> 03:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
organic reduction are ways of carrying
 
03:20:43.990 --> 03:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
ing for the Dead with minimal
 
03:20:46.910 --> 03:20:46.920 align:start position:0%
environmental impact it aids in the
 
03:20:49.269 --> 03:20:49.279 align:start position:0%
conservation of Natural
 
03:20:52.670 --> 03:20:52.680 align:start position:0%
Resources both reduce carbon emissions
 
03:20:56.030 --> 03:20:56.040 align:start position:0%
protect worker health help restore or
 
03:20:57.510 --> 03:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
preserve natural
 
03:21:03.269 --> 03:21:03.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:06.750 --> 03:21:06.760 align:start position:0%
space there's a lot of resources used um
 
03:21:09.150 --> 03:21:09.160 align:start position:0%
and other drawbacks to Conventional
 
03:21:11.630 --> 03:21:11.640 align:start position:0%
burial they take up valuable space in
 
03:21:13.070 --> 03:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
our cities and
 
03:21:16.429 --> 03:21:16.439 align:start position:0%
towns and bombing fluids are highly
 
03:21:19.189 --> 03:21:19.199 align:start position:0%
toxic morticians who do this work have
 
03:21:21.630 --> 03:21:21.640 align:start position:0%
eight times the leukemia rate as the
 
03:21:24.950 --> 03:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
general population and 13 times the rate
 
03:21:28.590 --> 03:21:28.600 align:start position:0%
of early death due to many other
 
03:21:30.830 --> 03:21:30.840 align:start position:0%
diseases and we also potentially
 
03:21:32.910 --> 03:21:32.920 align:start position:0%
contaminate the soil and groundwater
 
03:21:35.110 --> 03:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
with these
 
03:21:38.469 --> 03:21:38.479 align:start position:0%
toxins and caskets and B also take up
 
03:21:38.479 --> 03:21:39.750 align:start position:0%
toxins and caskets and B also take up
valuable

03:21:39.750 --> 03:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
valuable
 
03:21:43.269 --> 03:21:43.279 align:start position:0%
resources hardwood Steel and concrete
 
03:21:47.389 --> 03:21:47.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:50.710 --> 03:21:50.720 align:start position:0%
ground in many ways green burial is
 
03:21:52.870 --> 03:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
returning to the way humans have buried
 
03:21:54.630 --> 03:21:54.640 align:start position:0%
their loved ones for
 
03:21:57.510 --> 03:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
Millennia really interrupted only in the
 
03:21:57.520 --> 03:21:59.110 align:start position:0%
Millennia really interrupted only in the
last

03:21:59.110 --> 03:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
last
 
03:22:02.110 --> 03:22:02.120 align:start position:0%
century yeah this shows a a photo of a
 
03:22:06.110 --> 03:22:06.120 align:start position:0%
grave that's it's not that deep um and
 
03:22:08.750 --> 03:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
people have scattered flowers and it's
 
03:22:10.750 --> 03:22:10.760 align:start position:0%
clearly in a wild
 
03:22:10.760 --> 03:22:13.590 align:start position:0%
clearly in a wild
location

03:22:13.590 --> 03:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
location
 
03:22:16.590 --> 03:22:16.600 align:start position:0%
green burial cemeteries um have been
 
03:22:18.950 --> 03:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
growing in recent
 
03:22:22.030 --> 03:22:22.040 align:start position:0%
years and this this shows a chart just
 
03:22:25.309 --> 03:22:25.319 align:start position:0%
um in the last 18 years or so how it's
 
03:22:27.790 --> 03:22:27.800 align:start position:0%
continued to grow and I passed out one
 
03:22:29.510 --> 03:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
of the handouts is a list of all the
 
03:22:33.189 --> 03:22:33.199 align:start position:0%
green cemeteries in the state of New
 
03:22:35.950 --> 03:22:35.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and when I first saw this list
 
03:22:38.429 --> 03:22:38.439 align:start position:0%
I was surprised there weren't any in
 
03:22:42.710 --> 03:22:42.720 align:start position:0%
do my town and only till to learn that
 
03:22:45.950 --> 03:22:45.960 align:start position:0%
um we actually the Quaker Cemetery in do
 
03:22:50.670 --> 03:22:50.680 align:start position:0%
was on the list at one point and that
 
03:22:52.790 --> 03:22:52.800 align:start position:0%
congregation asked to be taken off the
 
03:22:54.389 --> 03:22:54.399 align:start position:0%
list because they're getting so many
 
03:22:56.510 --> 03:22:56.520 align:start position:0%
calls from people asking if they could
 
03:22:58.469 --> 03:22:58.479 align:start position:0%
be buried there and they felt they
 
03:23:01.389 --> 03:23:01.399 align:start position:0%
weren't really equipped that to handle
 
03:23:01.399 --> 03:23:05.630 align:start position:0%
weren't really equipped that to handle
that

03:23:05.630 --> 03:23:05.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:05.640 --> 03:23:08.389 align:start position:0%
 
demand

03:23:08.389 --> 03:23:08.399 align:start position:0%
demand
 
03:23:12.309 --> 03:23:12.319 align:start position:0%
sorry so HB 1324
 
03:23:14.269 --> 03:23:14.279 align:start position:0%
introduces new definitions to the
 
03:23:15.870 --> 03:23:15.880 align:start position:0%
chapter on
 
03:23:18.630 --> 03:23:18.640 align:start position:0%
cemeteries what is a natural burial it
 
03:23:20.750 --> 03:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
means the interment of an unembalmed
 
03:23:23.429 --> 03:23:23.439 align:start position:0%
human remains or human remains embalmed
 
03:23:26.070 --> 03:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
using non-toxic and bombing fluids and
 
03:23:28.429 --> 03:23:28.439 align:start position:0%
that rest in a non-toxic non-hazardous
 
03:23:32.910 --> 03:23:32.920 align:start position:0%
plant derived disposition container or
 
03:23:36.429 --> 03:23:36.439 align:start position:0%
shroud and this is a picture of two
 
03:23:39.630 --> 03:23:39.640 align:start position:0%
caskets that would break down relatively
 
03:23:43.429 --> 03:23:43.439 align:start position:0%
quickly you know wicker or a pine casket
 
03:23:45.349 --> 03:23:45.359 align:start position:0%
yes representative you don't really need
 
03:23:47.469 --> 03:23:47.479 align:start position:0%
to read the slides to us since you're
 
03:23:50.349 --> 03:23:50.359 align:start position:0%
providing all of them okay yes I do have
 
03:23:53.269 --> 03:23:53.279 align:start position:0%
the handouts mhm
 
03:23:55.389 --> 03:23:55.399 align:start position:0%
okay oops
 
03:23:58.510 --> 03:23:58.520 align:start position:0%
sorry um I also found out that green
 
03:24:01.189 --> 03:24:01.199 align:start position:0%
barar is are already legal in New
 
03:24:03.670 --> 03:24:03.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um so you can have one in your
 
03:24:05.389 --> 03:24:05.399 align:start position:0%
backyard if you want to but that's not
 
03:24:08.349 --> 03:24:08.359 align:start position:0%
really practical unless you live on a
 
03:24:11.110 --> 03:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
land that's not going to be developed um
 
03:24:11.120 --> 03:24:12.269 align:start position:0%
land that's not going to be developed um
because

03:24:12.269 --> 03:24:12.279 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:24:15.389 --> 03:24:15.399 align:start position:0%
we can see what happens uh to some old
 
03:24:21.389 --> 03:24:21.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:23.750 --> 03:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
field but most people would like to be
 
03:24:26.590 --> 03:24:26.600 align:start position:0%
buried in the cemetery and our statutes
 
03:24:29.189 --> 03:24:29.199 align:start position:0%
require that municipalities provide a
 
03:24:31.910 --> 03:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
cemetery for for people to be buried in
 
03:24:34.710 --> 03:24:34.720 align:start position:0%
in their Town yeah I went over the list
 
03:24:36.429 --> 03:24:36.439 align:start position:0%
of green
 
03:24:36.439 --> 03:24:38.750 align:start position:0%
of green
burials

03:24:38.750 --> 03:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
burials
 
03:24:42.429 --> 03:24:42.439 align:start position:0%
already but HB 1324 also Al defines what
 
03:24:45.309 --> 03:24:45.319 align:start position:0%
a natural burial ground
 
03:24:49.309 --> 03:24:49.319 align:start position:0%
is um the the the main reason you know
 
03:24:51.550 --> 03:24:51.560 align:start position:0%
so green Barrow is already legal in New
 
03:24:53.790 --> 03:24:53.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but the main reason it's hard
 
03:24:56.750 --> 03:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
to get one is the cemetery bylaws
 
03:24:59.710 --> 03:24:59.720 align:start position:0%
prohibit it by still
 
03:25:02.950 --> 03:25:02.960 align:start position:0%
requiring uh vaults and this is a
 
03:25:06.870 --> 03:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
picture of a whole stack of vaults in a
 
03:25:09.990 --> 03:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
warehouse the vault is what requires the
 
03:25:14.269 --> 03:25:14.279 align:start position:0%
burial to be so much deeper commonly
 
03:25:16.670 --> 03:25:16.680 align:start position:0%
referred to as 6 feet
 
03:25:20.150 --> 03:25:20.160 align:start position:0%
under um actually the the law that was
 
03:25:22.750 --> 03:25:22.760 align:start position:0%
changed in Vermont the only thing they
 
03:25:25.950 --> 03:25:25.960 align:start position:0%
had to change was the burial depth they
 
03:25:29.950 --> 03:25:29.960 align:start position:0%
had a statute that the grave had to be I
 
03:25:32.229 --> 03:25:32.239 align:start position:0%
think it was five or six feet
 
03:25:38.510 --> 03:25:38.520 align:start position:0%
deep um but that's not ideal for green
 
03:25:42.070 --> 03:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
burial um other things that the alts do
 
03:25:45.309 --> 03:25:45.319 align:start position:0%
is they um they increase the depth and
 
03:25:48.229 --> 03:25:48.239 align:start position:0%
width that's needed the width as well
 
03:25:50.309 --> 03:25:50.319 align:start position:0%
and a lot of that's just for running the
 
03:25:52.910 --> 03:25:52.920 align:start position:0%
lawnmowers and to prevent the ground
 
03:25:52.920 --> 03:25:55.750 align:start position:0%
lawnmowers and to prevent the ground
from

03:25:55.750 --> 03:25:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:58.150 --> 03:25:58.160 align:start position:0%
sinking but with the grain
 
03:26:00.590 --> 03:26:00.600 align:start position:0%
burial you really want to be about 3 and
 
03:26:04.550 --> 03:26:04.560 align:start position:0%
1/2 ft underground which allows for
 
03:26:07.070 --> 03:26:07.080 align:start position:0%
natural decomposition to
 
03:26:10.389 --> 03:26:10.399 align:start position:0%
happen um and you could
 
03:26:14.870 --> 03:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
pile um more organic material on top or
 
03:26:17.469 --> 03:26:17.479 align:start position:0%
soil a big Mound on top of the Grave
 
03:26:21.269 --> 03:26:21.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:24.830 --> 03:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
gradually and this is a picture from the
 
03:26:26.870 --> 03:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
Green Mountain Cemetery in M pear
 
03:26:29.590 --> 03:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
Vermont where they've chosen just to
 
03:26:31.590 --> 03:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
have a more natural way of managing the
 
03:26:33.710 --> 03:26:33.720 align:start position:0%
grounds and not mowing it
 
03:26:36.590 --> 03:26:36.600 align:start position:0%
tight uh like a playing field or golf
 
03:26:38.269 --> 03:26:38.279 align:start position:0%
course but just let it grow a little
 
03:26:40.910 --> 03:26:40.920 align:start position:0%
wild and bushwack it once or twice a
 
03:26:40.920 --> 03:26:45.790 align:start position:0%
wild and bushwack it once or twice a
year

03:26:45.790 --> 03:26:45.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:48.269 --> 03:26:48.279 align:start position:0%
you know all cemeteries take up a lot of
 
03:26:50.469 --> 03:26:50.479 align:start position:0%
space but we we think they're going to
 
03:26:52.870 --> 03:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
be there forever but they're probably
 
03:26:56.309 --> 03:26:56.319 align:start position:0%
not um you know this is a picture of the
 
03:26:58.269 --> 03:26:58.279 align:start position:0%
catacombs in Paris where they they had
 
03:27:00.429 --> 03:27:00.439 align:start position:0%
to dig up a lot of cemeteries and move
 
03:27:04.550 --> 03:27:04.560 align:start position:0%
the bones to a big underground
 
03:27:08.590 --> 03:27:08.600 align:start position:0%
chamber a friend of mine went back to
 
03:27:11.710 --> 03:27:11.720 align:start position:0%
Switzerland where his mother had died 40
 
03:27:13.870 --> 03:27:13.880 align:start position:0%
years or so before so he went to visit
 
03:27:16.550 --> 03:27:16.560 align:start position:0%
her grave and he was told he couldn't
 
03:27:18.950 --> 03:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
find it and they said well that's that's
 
03:27:23.429 --> 03:27:23.439 align:start position:0%
gone now we we after 35 years we just
 
03:27:26.630 --> 03:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
remov that grave and he couldn't really
 
03:27:28.510 --> 03:27:28.520 align:start position:0%
get an explanation of what happened to
 
03:27:28.520 --> 03:27:31.070 align:start position:0%
get an explanation of what happened to
her

03:27:31.070 --> 03:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
her
 
03:27:34.590 --> 03:27:34.600 align:start position:0%
remains but the the other alternative to
 
03:27:37.469 --> 03:27:37.479 align:start position:0%
burial is to really leave leave no
 
03:27:40.070 --> 03:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
pernament Monument to our
 
03:27:44.590 --> 03:27:44.600 align:start position:0%
lives and reducing the body to ashes or
 
03:27:47.030 --> 03:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
soil which leads us to
 
03:27:49.550 --> 03:27:49.560 align:start position:0%
Cremation which is now the most common
 
03:27:52.269 --> 03:27:52.279 align:start position:0%
means of final disposition in New
 
03:27:59.750 --> 03:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:02.429 --> 03:28:02.439 align:start position:0%
cremation and why is cremation
 
03:28:04.269 --> 03:28:04.279 align:start position:0%
increasing in popularity it's it's
 
03:28:07.309 --> 03:28:07.319 align:start position:0%
cheaper doesn't take up space in a
 
03:28:09.469 --> 03:28:09.479 align:start position:0%
cemetery space is less available than it
 
03:28:12.429 --> 03:28:12.439 align:start position:0%
used to and you have more options for
 
03:28:14.590 --> 03:28:14.600 align:start position:0%
what you decide to do with the op the
 
03:28:14.600 --> 03:28:16.189 align:start position:0%
what you decide to do with the op the
the

03:28:16.189 --> 03:28:16.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:28:20.030 --> 03:28:20.040 align:start position:0%
ashes but you could see that um
 
03:28:23.510 --> 03:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
cremation in a way it's very um it's
 
03:28:25.790 --> 03:28:25.800 align:start position:0%
like death sort of
 
03:28:28.710 --> 03:28:28.720 align:start position:0%
disappears for me I spent a lot of time
 
03:28:31.309 --> 03:28:31.319 align:start position:0%
with my dad right up to the end of his
 
03:28:32.510 --> 03:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
life when he
 
03:28:36.150 --> 03:28:36.160 align:start position:0%
died and then when he went to be
 
03:28:38.630 --> 03:28:38.640 align:start position:0%
cremated we weren't even it wasn't
 
03:28:40.830 --> 03:28:40.840 align:start position:0%
suggested that we go along and witness
 
03:28:40.840 --> 03:28:42.269 align:start position:0%
suggested that we go along and witness
that

03:28:42.269 --> 03:28:42.279 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:28:46.590 --> 03:28:46.600 align:start position:0%
process at all it's he was just gone and
 
03:28:49.349 --> 03:28:49.359 align:start position:0%
then a couple weeks later we we got the
 
03:28:49.359 --> 03:28:50.189 align:start position:0%
then a couple weeks later we we got the
the

03:28:50.189 --> 03:28:50.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:28:54.950 --> 03:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
ashes where with a a natural bars more
 
03:28:58.309 --> 03:28:58.319 align:start position:0%
gentle I think I think of it as a gentle
 
03:29:02.510 --> 03:29:02.520 align:start position:0%
disposition that family members can
 
03:29:05.710 --> 03:29:05.720 align:start position:0%
witness um this is just a little more
 
03:29:09.349 --> 03:29:09.359 align:start position:0%
of you can also choose to bury ashes
 
03:29:13.469 --> 03:29:13.479 align:start position:0%
cremated ashes in a cemetery as well or
 
03:29:16.830 --> 03:29:16.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:20.030 --> 03:29:20.040 align:start position:0%
columbarium but why not
 
03:29:22.070 --> 03:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
cremation why would we want an
 
03:29:24.550 --> 03:29:24.560 align:start position:0%
alternative to that since it's so
 
03:29:27.150 --> 03:29:27.160 align:start position:0%
popular well it uses a lot of fossil
 
03:29:30.710 --> 03:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
fuels to burn a body at a really high
 
03:29:35.790 --> 03:29:35.800 align:start position:0%
temperature andits a lot of CO2 into the
 
03:29:38.710 --> 03:29:38.720 align:start position:0%
air it uses a lot of fuel up and it
 
03:29:40.110 --> 03:29:40.120 align:start position:0%
creates air
 
03:29:43.630 --> 03:29:43.640 align:start position:0%
pollution locally and can release um
 
03:29:46.750 --> 03:29:46.760 align:start position:0%
heavy metals and other elements into the
 
03:29:51.030 --> 03:29:51.040 align:start position:0%
air which leads us to natural organic
 
03:29:54.189 --> 03:29:54.199 align:start position:0%
reduction which can be seen as an
 
03:29:56.229 --> 03:29:56.239 align:start position:0%
alternative to
 
03:29:58.670 --> 03:29:58.680 align:start position:0%
Cremation likewise it's considered the
 
03:29:58.680 --> 03:30:00.070 align:start position:0%
Cremation likewise it's considered the
final

03:30:00.070 --> 03:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
final
 
03:30:03.670 --> 03:30:03.680 align:start position:0%
disposition and instead of getting ashes
 
03:30:06.349 --> 03:30:06.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:10.030 --> 03:30:10.040 align:start position:0%
soil so HP 1324
 
03:30:12.630 --> 03:30:12.640 align:start position:0%
authorizes natural organic reduction and
 
03:30:15.150 --> 03:30:15.160 align:start position:0%
we have definitions of that in the
 
03:30:18.110 --> 03:30:18.120 align:start position:0%
cemetery chapter as well as the soil
 
03:30:21.110 --> 03:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
that results and a big part of that long
 
03:30:26.950 --> 03:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
bill you received is a new chapter under
 
03:30:29.110 --> 03:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
325 which is under the funeral
 
03:30:32.910 --> 03:30:32.920 align:start position:0%
director's um chapter to establish how
 
03:30:35.750 --> 03:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
The Lure and oversight of natural
 
03:30:38.349 --> 03:30:38.359 align:start position:0%
organic reduction will happen in New
 
03:30:41.830 --> 03:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and it's modeled very much
 
03:30:44.189 --> 03:30:44.199 align:start position:0%
after the chapter on
 
03:30:46.790 --> 03:30:46.800 align:start position:0%
cremation I think we would all agree
 
03:30:49.710 --> 03:30:49.720 align:start position:0%
that when it comes to handling dead
 
03:30:52.349 --> 03:30:52.359 align:start position:0%
bodies that we would want it carefully
 
03:30:54.590 --> 03:30:54.600 align:start position:0%
regulated and
 
03:30:57.309 --> 03:30:57.319 align:start position:0%
overseen a natural organic reduction is
 
03:30:59.189 --> 03:30:59.199 align:start position:0%
now legal in seven
 
03:31:02.950 --> 03:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
states and there's legislation underway
 
03:31:04.790 --> 03:31:04.800 align:start position:0%
in many states especially in New
 
03:31:04.800 --> 03:31:06.229 align:start position:0%
in many states especially in New
Hampshire

03:31:06.229 --> 03:31:06.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
03:31:10.189 --> 03:31:10.199 align:start position:0%
now um and it's a new means of
 
03:31:10.199 --> 03:31:11.630 align:start position:0%
now um and it's a new means of
disposition

03:31:11.630 --> 03:31:11.640 align:start position:0%
disposition
 
03:31:14.189 --> 03:31:14.199 align:start position:0%
of human remains though the science
 
03:31:16.469 --> 03:31:16.479 align:start position:0%
behind it has been used for composting
 
03:31:20.990 --> 03:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:24.469 --> 03:31:24.479 align:start position:0%
decades and how it
 
03:31:26.710 --> 03:31:26.720 align:start position:0%
works I don't know if you want me to go
 
03:31:28.189 --> 03:31:28.199 align:start position:0%
through this at all but I think people
 
03:31:30.550 --> 03:31:30.560 align:start position:0%
really don't understand but the body's
 
03:31:31.990 --> 03:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
placed in a
 
03:31:35.389 --> 03:31:35.399 align:start position:0%
vessel wrapped in cotton or wood shroud
 
03:31:39.750 --> 03:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
wool shroud and laid on a bed of organic
 
03:31:42.950 --> 03:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
material and in a cemetery friends can
 
03:31:46.189 --> 03:31:46.199 align:start position:0%
add flowers and they can have or other
 
03:31:48.750 --> 03:31:48.760 align:start position:0%
meaningful organic material
 
03:31:51.670 --> 03:31:51.680 align:start position:0%
to into the
 
03:31:54.389 --> 03:31:54.399 align:start position:0%
chamber and air and water is sometimes
 
03:31:56.630 --> 03:31:56.640 align:start position:0%
pumped in the vessel to create ideal
 
03:31:57.910 --> 03:31:57.920 align:start position:0%
conditions for
 
03:32:00.630 --> 03:32:00.640 align:start position:0%
decomposition and these are naturally
 
03:32:02.269 --> 03:32:02.279 align:start position:0%
microbes that are in the body and the
 
03:32:04.670 --> 03:32:04.680 align:start position:0%
soil naturally go to work and break
 
03:32:07.790 --> 03:32:07.800 align:start position:0%
everything down and its temperature and
 
03:32:10.070 --> 03:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
the air flow are carefully monitored and
 
03:32:10.080 --> 03:32:11.550 align:start position:0%
the air flow are carefully monitored and
controlled

03:32:11.550 --> 03:32:11.560 align:start position:0%
controlled
 
03:32:15.150 --> 03:32:15.160 align:start position:0%
and any gases are filtered out before
 
03:32:15.160 --> 03:32:16.349 align:start position:0%
and any gases are filtered out before
being

03:32:16.349 --> 03:32:16.359 align:start position:0%
being
 
03:32:19.910 --> 03:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
released and then a month and a half or
 
03:32:23.150 --> 03:32:23.160 align:start position:0%
so the body is completely transformed at
 
03:32:25.710 --> 03:32:25.720 align:start position:0%
the end there are just bones left there
 
03:32:27.590 --> 03:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
might be medical implants that are
 
03:32:31.030 --> 03:32:31.040 align:start position:0%
filtered out and remaining bones are
 
03:32:33.469 --> 03:32:33.479 align:start position:0%
ground into a powder and a cremulator
 
03:32:36.150 --> 03:32:36.160 align:start position:0%
which is what happens in cremation as
 
03:32:38.870 --> 03:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
well it's the same
 
03:32:41.269 --> 03:32:41.279 align:start position:0%
technology and the soil is car carefully
 
03:32:44.790 --> 03:32:44.800 align:start position:0%
tested for heavy metals and any bacteria
 
03:32:47.070 --> 03:32:47.080 align:start position:0%
it's usually stored for a month or
 
03:32:50.990 --> 03:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
two and then the resulting soil though
 
03:32:53.750 --> 03:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
is about a cubic yard of material
 
03:32:56.870 --> 03:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
because so much other matter was added
 
03:32:59.030 --> 03:32:59.040 align:start position:0%
to the
 
03:33:01.790 --> 03:33:01.800 align:start position:0%
vessel and I'm going to show some slides
 
03:33:03.990 --> 03:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
here that were provided by
 
03:33:06.830 --> 03:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
recompose which was really the first
 
03:33:09.750 --> 03:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
operator for natural organic reduction
 
03:33:11.510 --> 03:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
in the state of Washington and the
 
03:33:14.150 --> 03:33:14.160 align:start position:0%
picture here is Katrina Spade who's a
 
03:33:16.750 --> 03:33:16.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire n um
 
03:33:20.070 --> 03:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
Native and she founded this
 
03:33:24.389 --> 03:33:24.399 align:start position:0%
company so you have these in your um the
 
03:33:27.670 --> 03:33:27.680 align:start position:0%
handout but it basically goes over the
 
03:33:27.680 --> 03:33:28.630 align:start position:0%
handout but it basically goes over the
same

03:33:28.630 --> 03:33:28.640 align:start position:0%
same
 
03:33:32.229 --> 03:33:32.239 align:start position:0%
process and this fall I was out in the
 
03:33:35.469 --> 03:33:35.479 align:start position:0%
Pacific Northwest visiting family so I
 
03:33:38.469 --> 03:33:38.479 align:start position:0%
made a point of of touring the recompose
 
03:33:41.510 --> 03:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
facility I took this picture they
 
03:33:45.189 --> 03:33:45.199 align:start position:0%
operate as a funeral home so the
 
03:33:47.790 --> 03:33:47.800 align:start position:0%
cemeteries I mean I'm sorry the
 
03:33:51.670 --> 03:33:51.680 align:start position:0%
ceremony um is run like the funeral
 
03:33:54.110 --> 03:33:54.120 align:start position:0%
there and this is a picture of like the
 
03:33:56.309 --> 03:33:56.319 align:start position:0%
ceremonial chamber in the room while
 
03:33:58.990 --> 03:33:59.000 align:start position:0%
they'll have the ceremony and then it's
 
03:34:01.110 --> 03:34:01.120 align:start position:0%
transferred to the back
 
03:34:03.309 --> 03:34:03.319 align:start position:0%
room for the
 
03:34:07.750 --> 03:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
process and this is a picture of the
 
03:34:10.790 --> 03:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
soil which the resulting material is
 
03:34:12.790 --> 03:34:12.800 align:start position:0%
safe and Rich and you can use it on
 
03:34:16.670 --> 03:34:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:21.510 --> 03:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
Gardens um and families can choose well
 
03:34:23.870 --> 03:34:23.880 align:start position:0%
I'll skip over some of that because you
 
03:34:23.880 --> 03:34:25.389 align:start position:0%
I'll skip over some of that because you
have

03:34:25.389 --> 03:34:25.399 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:34:27.990 --> 03:34:28.000 align:start position:0%
that um but there's really careful
 
03:34:30.189 --> 03:34:30.199 align:start position:0%
recordkeeping in Seattle and other
 
03:34:32.150 --> 03:34:32.160 align:start position:0%
states where it's
 
03:34:35.070 --> 03:34:35.080 align:start position:0%
legalized for both the chain of custody
 
03:34:37.189 --> 03:34:37.199 align:start position:0%
for the body and the
 
03:34:42.349 --> 03:34:42.359 align:start position:0%
soil and um temperature soil testing
 
03:34:45.269 --> 03:34:45.279 align:start position:0%
this is another um vessel from a
 
03:34:50.710 --> 03:34:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:53.950 --> 03:34:53.960 align:start position:0%
Washington so of the soil some people
 
03:34:55.389 --> 03:34:55.399 align:start position:0%
would take it home just like they would
 
03:34:57.950 --> 03:34:57.960 align:start position:0%
pick up ashes and bring it home and at
 
03:35:00.189 --> 03:35:00.199 align:start position:0%
that point it's not considered a body
 
03:35:02.469 --> 03:35:02.479 align:start position:0%
anymore there actually aren't any traces
 
03:35:04.750 --> 03:35:04.760 align:start position:0%
of of
 
03:35:08.510 --> 03:35:08.520 align:start position:0%
DNA remaining so it can be planted in
 
03:35:10.750 --> 03:35:10.760 align:start position:0%
your own garden if you want but most
 
03:35:12.510 --> 03:35:12.520 align:start position:0%
people aren't going to take a pickup
 
03:35:16.910 --> 03:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
truck full of material home so most of
 
03:35:23.429 --> 03:35:23.439 align:start position:0%
the operators will donate that soil to a
 
03:35:26.030 --> 03:35:26.040 align:start position:0%
um a land conservation program or
 
03:35:26.040 --> 03:35:29.030 align:start position:0%
um a land conservation program or
reforest

03:35:29.030 --> 03:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:29.040 --> 03:35:31.229 align:start position:0%
 
station

03:35:31.229 --> 03:35:31.239 align:start position:0%
station
 
03:35:34.710 --> 03:35:34.720 align:start position:0%
and and this is a picture of some of the
 
03:35:38.429 --> 03:35:38.439 align:start position:0%
land where the unclaimed soil from
 
03:35:40.269 --> 03:35:40.279 align:start position:0%
recomposed goes and each of those little
 
03:35:46.389 --> 03:35:46.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:50.349 --> 03:35:50.359 align:start position:0%
sapling so I just want to review what HB
 
03:35:54.349 --> 03:35:54.359 align:start position:0%
1324 does not do is mandate green
 
03:35:57.309 --> 03:35:57.319 align:start position:0%
burials it does not prohibit and bombing
 
03:35:59.469 --> 03:35:59.479 align:start position:0%
or conventional
 
03:36:02.030 --> 03:36:02.040 align:start position:0%
burials it doesn't change any laws
 
03:36:04.229 --> 03:36:04.239 align:start position:0%
regarding cemeteries or burials we just
 
03:36:06.269 --> 03:36:06.279 align:start position:0%
have added more definitions to the
 
03:36:09.469 --> 03:36:09.479 align:start position:0%
cemetery chapter and it does not
 
03:36:12.630 --> 03:36:12.640 align:start position:0%
authorize Al Aline
 
03:36:15.150 --> 03:36:15.160 align:start position:0%
hydrolysis what it does do is offer
 
03:36:17.189 --> 03:36:17.199 align:start position:0%
greater choice for New Hampshire
 
03:36:19.550 --> 03:36:19.560 align:start position:0%
residents and addition to Conventional
 
03:36:21.349 --> 03:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
burial and natural burial and Flame
 
03:36:24.950 --> 03:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
cremation and what happens to our bodies
 
03:36:24.960 --> 03:36:25.990 align:start position:0%
cremation and what happens to our bodies
after

03:36:25.990 --> 03:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
after
 
03:36:28.870 --> 03:36:28.880 align:start position:0%
death it will hopefully facilitate more
 
03:36:32.070 --> 03:36:32.080 align:start position:0%
cemeteries to adopt green green burial
 
03:36:35.590 --> 03:36:35.600 align:start position:0%
ideas if they choose and it clarifies
 
03:36:37.710 --> 03:36:37.720 align:start position:0%
scattering Gardens and rights in
 
03:36:37.720 --> 03:36:39.469 align:start position:0%
scattering Gardens and rights in
Memorial

03:36:39.469 --> 03:36:39.479 align:start position:0%
Memorial
 
03:36:39.479 --> 03:36:41.469 align:start position:0%
Memorial
forests

03:36:41.469 --> 03:36:41.479 align:start position:0%
forests
 
03:36:46.030 --> 03:36:46.040 align:start position:0%
so I am uh open to any
 
03:36:48.349 --> 03:36:48.359 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
03:36:51.790 --> 03:36:51.800 align:start position:0%
sh thank you madam chair um I have quite
 
03:36:56.269 --> 03:36:56.279 align:start position:0%
a few questions actually um I'm assuming
 
03:36:59.830 --> 03:36:59.840 align:start position:0%
that um you are talking about possibly
 
03:37:03.070 --> 03:37:03.080 align:start position:0%
being incorporated into cemeteries that
 
03:37:05.349 --> 03:37:05.359 align:start position:0%
already exist within our
 
03:37:08.269 --> 03:37:08.279 align:start position:0%
municipalities not just new uh
 
03:37:11.070 --> 03:37:11.080 align:start position:0%
cemeteries is that true
 
03:37:14.750 --> 03:37:14.760 align:start position:0%
do you mean the soil or well you talk
 
03:37:19.510 --> 03:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
about green cemeteries yes uh and I'm
 
03:37:23.630 --> 03:37:23.640 align:start position:0%
I'm looking and you don't change any of
 
03:37:27.990 --> 03:37:28.000 align:start position:0%
the existing for example 289 colon 2
 
03:37:30.830 --> 03:37:30.840 align:start position:0%
which says that Municipal cemeteries are
 
03:37:33.830 --> 03:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
subject to the regulations of the
 
03:37:36.670 --> 03:37:36.680 align:start position:0%
municipality so each municipality would
 
03:37:39.189 --> 03:37:39.199 align:start position:0%
then have to change its rules or
 
03:37:41.830 --> 03:37:41.840 align:start position:0%
ordinances in in order to allow that is
 
03:37:45.189 --> 03:37:45.199 align:start position:0%
that true that is correct Okay and like
 
03:37:46.910 --> 03:37:46.920 align:start position:0%
I have already gone to the Dober
 
03:37:46.920 --> 03:37:48.189 align:start position:0%
I have already gone to the Dober
Cemetery

03:37:48.189 --> 03:37:48.199 align:start position:0%
Cemetery
 
03:37:50.790 --> 03:37:50.800 align:start position:0%
board to promote the idea of changing
 
03:37:53.229 --> 03:37:53.239 align:start position:0%
their Cemetery laws but it's is not a
 
03:37:55.710 --> 03:37:55.720 align:start position:0%
state mandate that every municipality
 
03:37:59.550 --> 03:37:59.560 align:start position:0%
has to but each municipality would have
 
03:38:02.950 --> 03:38:02.960 align:start position:0%
to make uh changes in order to allow it
 
03:38:07.349 --> 03:38:07.359 align:start position:0%
yes okay U followup followup um I'm also
 
03:38:10.710 --> 03:38:10.720 align:start position:0%
concerned um you talk about being able
 
03:38:14.070 --> 03:38:14.080 align:start position:0%
to do a burial on your own private
 
03:38:17.349 --> 03:38:17.359 align:start position:0%
property um would there be some kind of
 
03:38:20.150 --> 03:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
stipulation that if and when that
 
03:38:23.309 --> 03:38:23.319 align:start position:0%
property changes hands if it gets sold
 
03:38:26.150 --> 03:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
that the new buyer should be informed
 
03:38:28.950 --> 03:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
that yes that is existing statute that
 
03:38:31.510 --> 03:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
you may bury you may may be buried on
 
03:38:34.469 --> 03:38:34.479 align:start position:0%
your own property and you do have to
 
03:38:38.510 --> 03:38:38.520 align:start position:0%
record that grave on the deed so future
 
03:38:41.990 --> 03:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
residents know but that's already in
 
03:38:46.030 --> 03:38:46.040 align:start position:0%
statute okay thank you and follow follow
 
03:38:50.309 --> 03:38:50.319 align:start position:0%
up um on page one line
 
03:38:55.830 --> 03:38:55.840 align:start position:0%
22 uh talking about um crated remains or
 
03:38:58.550 --> 03:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
natural organic
 
03:39:02.510 --> 03:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
reduction uh can be mixed with or placed
 
03:39:06.510 --> 03:39:06.520 align:start position:0%
on top of the soil or ground and I
 
03:39:08.469 --> 03:39:08.479 align:start position:0%
understanding that this would be placed
 
03:39:12.150 --> 03:39:12.160 align:start position:0%
on top of the ground not covered in any
 
03:39:15.429 --> 03:39:15.439 align:start position:0%
way that might be and that in that case
 
03:39:17.710 --> 03:39:17.720 align:start position:0%
we are talking about the
 
03:39:20.950 --> 03:39:20.960 align:start position:0%
soil so it it is
 
03:39:24.469 --> 03:39:24.479 align:start position:0%
not once natural or redu organic
 
03:39:26.990 --> 03:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
reduction has taken place that's
 
03:39:29.309 --> 03:39:29.319 align:start position:0%
considered the final disposition it's
 
03:39:31.830 --> 03:39:31.840 align:start position:0%
not considered a body
 
03:39:35.990 --> 03:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
anymore and it the material can be
 
03:39:38.030 --> 03:39:38.040 align:start position:0%
treated as
 
03:39:42.630 --> 03:39:42.640 align:start position:0%
soil as soil okay okay and it's so
 
03:39:45.830 --> 03:39:45.840 align:start position:0%
there is there any concern that that
 
03:39:49.110 --> 03:39:49.120 align:start position:0%
would um attract animals that might be
 
03:39:49.120 --> 03:39:50.389 align:start position:0%
would um attract animals that might be
attracted

03:39:50.389 --> 03:39:50.399 align:start position:0%
attracted
 
03:39:54.349 --> 03:39:54.359 align:start position:0%
to no more than any other soil would be
 
03:39:57.910 --> 03:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
there's really no Trace left of what was
 
03:40:00.710 --> 03:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
a body thank
 
03:40:04.590 --> 03:40:04.600 align:start position:0%
you represent leus this is kind of a
 
03:40:06.990 --> 03:40:07.000 align:start position:0%
maybe clarification question for what
 
03:40:11.269 --> 03:40:11.279 align:start position:0%
representative Shu asked so you said if
 
03:40:13.590 --> 03:40:13.600 align:start position:0%
you know it's put on private land
 
03:40:15.510 --> 03:40:15.520 align:start position:0%
there's still there's current statute
 
03:40:18.150 --> 03:40:18.160 align:start position:0%
about recording that but if it's not
 
03:40:20.429 --> 03:40:20.439 align:start position:0%
considered a body and it's just soil is
 
03:40:23.309 --> 03:40:23.319 align:start position:0%
that really required now that well you
 
03:40:26.389 --> 03:40:26.399 align:start position:0%
have to record if you're burying a body
 
03:40:28.269 --> 03:40:28.279 align:start position:0%
if you're making a
 
03:40:31.670 --> 03:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
grave so with the soil it's not
 
03:40:33.990 --> 03:40:34.000 align:start position:0%
considered a body
 
03:40:38.110 --> 03:40:38.120 align:start position:0%
anymore people routinely scatter ashes
 
03:40:40.590 --> 03:40:40.600 align:start position:0%
that we have nothing in statute about
 
03:40:43.590 --> 03:40:43.600 align:start position:0%
their right to do that which we actually
 
03:40:46.990 --> 03:40:47.000 align:start position:0%
do in here we did clarify that you have
 
03:40:50.469 --> 03:40:50.479 align:start position:0%
a right to scatter ashes or the soil on
 
03:40:53.189 --> 03:40:53.199 align:start position:0%
private property with
 
03:40:55.830 --> 03:40:55.840 align:start position:0%
permission and likewise if you were to
 
03:41:02.429 --> 03:41:02.439 align:start position:0%
donate it the soil to a a conservation
 
03:41:02.439 --> 03:41:04.030 align:start position:0%
donate it the soil to a a conservation
land

03:41:04.030 --> 03:41:04.040 align:start position:0%
land
 
03:41:06.469 --> 03:41:06.479 align:start position:0%
um you that would that you could have an
 
03:41:08.910 --> 03:41:08.920 align:start position:0%
arrangement to do that whether it's a a
 
03:41:11.910 --> 03:41:11.920 align:start position:0%
a green Cemetery where they may use the
 
03:41:15.070 --> 03:41:15.080 align:start position:0%
soil as fill cemeteries actually are
 
03:41:19.150 --> 03:41:19.160 align:start position:0%
looking for fill all the time um you
 
03:41:21.349 --> 03:41:21.359 align:start position:0%
know my husband and I are uh work in
 
03:41:23.710 --> 03:41:23.720 align:start position:0%
construction and we once had a chimney
 
03:41:25.469 --> 03:41:25.479 align:start position:0%
taken down and we're trying to find a
 
03:41:27.870 --> 03:41:27.880 align:start position:0%
way like wow it's a very expensive thing
 
03:41:30.030 --> 03:41:30.040 align:start position:0%
to bury and someone said oh just go ask
 
03:41:32.750 --> 03:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
Tom Duffy the grav digger he takes the
 
03:41:36.229 --> 03:41:36.239 align:start position:0%
bricks and sure enough we delivered the
 
03:41:38.269 --> 03:41:38.279 align:start position:0%
bricks to the cemetery which we used to
 
03:41:40.630 --> 03:41:40.640 align:start position:0%
fill in holes so this would be an
 
03:41:42.630 --> 03:41:42.640 align:start position:0%
alternative of perhaps some more
 
03:41:45.309 --> 03:41:45.319 align:start position:0%
appropriate material to fill in holes in
 
03:41:45.319 --> 03:41:46.070 align:start position:0%
appropriate material to fill in holes in
the

03:41:46.070 --> 03:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:41:49.469 --> 03:41:49.479 align:start position:0%
cemetery because it's just soil and if
 
03:41:52.550 --> 03:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
people want to take it to a place that
 
03:41:55.229 --> 03:41:55.239 align:start position:0%
they consider sacred or
 
03:41:57.710 --> 03:41:57.720 align:start position:0%
protected a cemetery might be a good
 
03:41:59.149 --> 03:41:59.159 align:start position:0%
place to take
 
03:42:01.389 --> 03:42:01.399 align:start position:0%
that great thank
 
03:42:05.189 --> 03:42:05.199 align:start position:0%
you representative Brown thank you madam
 
03:42:08.950 --> 03:42:08.960 align:start position:0%
chair um
 
03:42:10.990 --> 03:42:11.000 align:start position:0%
composting sludge from wastewater
 
03:42:13.110 --> 03:42:13.120 align:start position:0%
treatment plants which can have
 
03:42:16.429 --> 03:42:16.439 align:start position:0%
pathogens from humans requires some
 
03:42:18.950 --> 03:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
significant monitoring and certain steps
 
03:42:20.469 --> 03:42:20.479 align:start position:0%
that have to be reached in temperature
 
03:42:23.830 --> 03:42:23.840 align:start position:0%
and time to assure that you have
 
03:42:27.389 --> 03:42:27.399 align:start position:0%
pathogen reduction yes I would assume
 
03:42:29.950 --> 03:42:29.960 align:start position:0%
the potential is there from any any
 
03:42:32.110 --> 03:42:32.120 align:start position:0%
human remain so is that incorporated
 
03:42:35.110 --> 03:42:35.120 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe it will be come up later but
 
03:42:38.269 --> 03:42:38.279 align:start position:0%
yes we we did not put in the chapter
 
03:42:42.149 --> 03:42:42.159 align:start position:0%
very specific things about
 
03:42:45.950 --> 03:42:45.960 align:start position:0%
how the soil will be tested and
 
03:42:49.229 --> 03:42:49.239 align:start position:0%
monitored but it's clear that um since
 
03:42:50.870 --> 03:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
it would be
 
03:42:53.750 --> 03:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
regulated by
 
03:42:58.710 --> 03:42:58.720 align:start position:0%
oplc um that those rules could be set up
 
03:43:00.590 --> 03:43:00.600 align:start position:0%
and could be modeled
 
03:43:03.429 --> 03:43:03.439 align:start position:0%
after how the process is done in other
 
03:43:05.910 --> 03:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
states where they do the testing and the
 
03:43:08.870 --> 03:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
state does not pay for the testing the
 
03:43:13.149 --> 03:43:13.159 align:start position:0%
operator assumes all the cost it's just
 
03:43:16.469 --> 03:43:16.479 align:start position:0%
um checked on by the
 
03:43:19.870 --> 03:43:19.880 align:start position:0%
state thank you representative leus
 
03:43:23.110 --> 03:43:23.120 align:start position:0%
thank you so uh in the I haven't care I
 
03:43:24.590 --> 03:43:24.600 align:start position:0%
don't remember the whole thing but is
 
03:43:26.710 --> 03:43:26.720 align:start position:0%
there someone here that deals with that
 
03:43:29.229 --> 03:43:29.239 align:start position:0%
issue that he just raised uh that
 
03:43:32.630 --> 03:43:32.640 align:start position:0%
actually gives oplc 541a rul making
 
03:43:36.110 --> 03:43:36.120 align:start position:0%
authority to to come up with those rules
 
03:43:37.990 --> 03:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
is that in
 
03:43:41.269 --> 03:43:41.279 align:start position:0%
here you know that I I am not sure about
 
03:43:45.910 --> 03:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
that we we did ask when we worked with
 
03:43:49.149 --> 03:43:49.159 align:start position:0%
OS and drafting this they wanted to be
 
03:43:54.870 --> 03:43:54.880 align:start position:0%
sure that all their recent changes in Ru
 
03:43:58.309 --> 03:43:58.319 align:start position:0%
making that they have for cremation were
 
03:44:00.870 --> 03:44:00.880 align:start position:0%
included in this bill so I'm not sure
 
03:44:03.030 --> 03:44:03.040 align:start position:0%
about the exact wording of that but I
 
03:44:06.670 --> 03:44:06.680 align:start position:0%
will look into it was my understanding
 
03:44:09.870 --> 03:44:09.880 align:start position:0%
that that would happen yes thank you yes
 
03:44:13.710 --> 03:44:13.720 align:start position:0%
yes there it's on page 11 Ru making
 
03:44:17.349 --> 03:44:17.359 align:start position:0%
Authority that gives the board authority
 
03:44:22.229 --> 03:44:22.239 align:start position:0%
including um lure
 
03:44:24.110 --> 03:44:24.120 align:start position:0%
requirements uh Public Health
 
03:44:26.630 --> 03:44:26.640 align:start position:0%
requirements sanitation and inspection
 
03:44:29.309 --> 03:44:29.319 align:start position:0%
requirements yeah I thought it was in
 
03:44:31.550 --> 03:44:31.560 align:start position:0%
there but I wasn't quite
 
03:44:31.560 --> 03:44:33.349 align:start position:0%
there but I wasn't quite
sure

03:44:33.349 --> 03:44:33.359 align:start position:0%
sure
 
03:44:35.590 --> 03:44:35.600 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
03:44:38.269 --> 03:44:38.279 align:start position:0%
MTI thank you madam chair thank you
 
03:44:39.870 --> 03:44:39.880 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
03:44:42.950 --> 03:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
question you in your presentation you
 
03:44:46.269 --> 03:44:46.279 align:start position:0%
alluded to the fact that embodying uh
 
03:44:50.830 --> 03:44:50.840 align:start position:0%
EMB bombing does use chemicals and that
 
03:44:55.070 --> 03:44:55.080 align:start position:0%
leeches once the body is buried it's
 
03:44:55.080 --> 03:44:56.710 align:start position:0%
leeches once the body is buried it's
already

03:44:56.710 --> 03:44:56.720 align:start position:0%
already
 
03:45:00.510 --> 03:45:00.520 align:start position:0%
leeching some toxins how is that
 
03:45:03.710 --> 03:45:03.720 align:start position:0%
measured who is responsible for that in
 
03:45:03.720 --> 03:45:05.950 align:start position:0%
measured who is responsible for that in
a

03:45:05.950 --> 03:45:05.960 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:45:10.510 --> 03:45:10.520 align:start position:0%
cemetery that I do not know um
 
03:45:12.389 --> 03:45:12.399 align:start position:0%
we have someone from the funeral
 
03:45:14.429 --> 03:45:14.439 align:start position:0%
director's board who might be able to
 
03:45:16.830 --> 03:45:16.840 align:start position:0%
answer that sort of technical question
 
03:45:18.710 --> 03:45:18.720 align:start position:0%
that's that's about current status and
 
03:45:22.229 --> 03:45:22.239 align:start position:0%
current law not not this
 
03:45:27.389 --> 03:45:27.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:29.870 --> 03:45:29.880 align:start position:0%
Dees okay any other
 
03:45:32.269 --> 03:45:32.279 align:start position:0%
questions all right thank you very much
 
03:45:38.670 --> 03:45:38.680 align:start position:0%

03:46:02.830 --> 03:46:02.840 align:start position:0%
okay need yes represent Montaine if you
 
03:46:04.149 --> 03:46:04.159 align:start position:0%
would fill out a pink card we'd
 
03:46:04.159 --> 03:46:08.590 align:start position:0%
would fill out a pink card we'd
appreciate

03:46:08.590 --> 03:46:08.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:08.600 --> 03:46:27.469 align:start position:0%

thing pleas thank you uh um chair
 
03:46:42.110 --> 03:46:42.120 align:start position:0%
McGuire honorable members of the
 
03:46:43.670 --> 03:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Will Derby I'm
 
03:46:45.950 --> 03:46:45.960 align:start position:0%
representative from national award 8
 
03:46:47.790 --> 03:46:47.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me to testify uh
 
03:46:51.309 --> 03:46:51.319 align:start position:0%
on behalf of HB 1325 this this
 
03:46:53.910 --> 03:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
afternoon like many of us as we age I
 
03:46:56.269 --> 03:46:56.279 align:start position:0%
recently began to think about life Derby
 
03:46:57.830 --> 03:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
could you please speak into the
 
03:47:00.070 --> 03:47:00.080 align:start position:0%
microphone it's very hard to hear you
 
03:47:01.149 --> 03:47:01.159 align:start position:0%
yes thank
 
03:47:01.159 --> 03:47:03.349 align:start position:0%
yes thank
you

03:47:03.349 --> 03:47:03.359 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:47:06.790 --> 03:47:06.800 align:start position:0%
um like many of us uh as we age I
 
03:47:08.790 --> 03:47:08.800 align:start position:0%
recently began to think about life's end
 
03:47:11.510 --> 03:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
and the arrangement of my remains as an
 
03:47:13.670 --> 03:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
Outdoorsman and conservationist my goal
 
03:47:15.030 --> 03:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
was to give back to the Earth that has
 
03:47:17.550 --> 03:47:17.560 align:start position:0%
given so much to me and I thought uh
 
03:47:19.189 --> 03:47:19.199 align:start position:0%
cremation and spreading the resultant
 
03:47:21.309 --> 03:47:21.319 align:start position:0%
ashes would enrich the soil and allow my
 
03:47:23.070 --> 03:47:23.080 align:start position:0%
wife and family to plan it free using
 
03:47:25.710 --> 03:47:25.720 align:start position:0%
them in my memory I was dispayed
 
03:47:27.750 --> 03:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
dismayed to learn that cremated remains
 
03:47:29.630 --> 03:47:29.640 align:start position:0%
have high alkaline and sodium content
 
03:47:31.590 --> 03:47:31.600 align:start position:0%
that is harmful to plants and must be
 
03:47:33.790 --> 03:47:33.800 align:start position:0%
neutralized before being used in
 
03:47:36.070 --> 03:47:36.080 align:start position:0%
plantings not exactly giving back to the
 
03:47:38.269 --> 03:47:38.279 align:start position:0%
Earth the way that I had hoped with a
 
03:47:40.110 --> 03:47:40.120 align:start position:0%
little research I learned a burgeoning
 
03:47:41.389 --> 03:47:41.399 align:start position:0%
technique called natural organic
 
03:47:44.309 --> 03:47:44.319 align:start position:0%
reduction which literally produces soil
 
03:47:46.030 --> 03:47:46.040 align:start position:0%
and can be used for planting a tree at
 
03:47:48.110 --> 03:47:48.120 align:start position:0%
home or rejuvenating a conservation
 
03:47:50.510 --> 03:47:50.520 align:start position:0%
Forest elsewhere in New Hampshire while
 
03:47:52.429 --> 03:47:52.439 align:start position:0%
natural organic reduction is legal in
 
03:47:54.950 --> 03:47:54.960 align:start position:0%
seven states New Hampshire only allows
 
03:47:57.429 --> 03:47:57.439 align:start position:0%
bodies to be buried cremated or donated
 
03:47:59.710 --> 03:47:59.720 align:start position:0%
to science and I was not looking to
 
03:48:01.349 --> 03:48:01.359 align:start position:0%
leave the state I
 
03:48:04.030 --> 03:48:04.040 align:start position:0%
love as I learned more I was excited to
 
03:48:05.670 --> 03:48:05.680 align:start position:0%
find natural organic reduction provides
 
03:48:09.469 --> 03:48:09.479 align:start position:0%
a myriad of benefits for example no soil
 
03:48:10.870 --> 03:48:10.880 align:start position:0%
which results from the process does not
 
03:48:12.469 --> 03:48:12.479 align:start position:0%
take up Cemetery space which many
 
03:48:14.070 --> 03:48:14.080 align:start position:0%
communities are struggling to make
 
03:48:16.990 --> 03:48:17.000 align:start position:0%
available as required by law as a soil
 
03:48:19.830 --> 03:48:19.840 align:start position:0%
can be taken home by loved ones uh for
 
03:48:22.349 --> 03:48:22.359 align:start position:0%
use in for example flower gardens or
 
03:48:24.110 --> 03:48:24.120 align:start position:0%
spread in conservation land like
 
03:48:24.120 --> 03:48:25.229 align:start position:0%
spread in conservation land like
Memorial

03:48:25.229 --> 03:48:25.239 align:start position:0%
Memorial
 
03:48:28.229 --> 03:48:28.239 align:start position:0%
forests ecological benef benefits in my
 
03:48:30.590 --> 03:48:30.600 align:start position:0%
opinion are another important reason to
 
03:48:32.670 --> 03:48:32.680 align:start position:0%
F to favor natural organic reduction
 
03:48:34.670 --> 03:48:34.680 align:start position:0%
over conventional methods of remains
 
03:48:37.710 --> 03:48:37.720 align:start position:0%
disposition not notably a dramatic
 
03:48:40.510 --> 03:48:40.520 align:start position:0%
reduction in carbon emissions and use of
 
03:48:41.910 --> 03:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
other materials such as EMB bombing
 
03:48:44.349 --> 03:48:44.359 align:start position:0%
fluids concrete and steel while New
 
03:48:46.590 --> 03:48:46.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does permit green burials
 
03:48:48.149 --> 03:48:48.159 align:start position:0%
there are few green cemeteries in the
 
03:48:50.389 --> 03:48:50.399 align:start position:0%
state and I personally want my family to
 
03:48:52.750 --> 03:48:52.760 align:start position:0%
be able to have a permanent reminder at
 
03:48:55.110 --> 03:48:55.120 align:start position:0%
home ultimately this bill is about
 
03:48:57.510 --> 03:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
choice and provide providing choices to
 
03:48:59.389 --> 03:48:59.399 align:start position:0%
families and to funeral service
 
03:49:01.590 --> 03:49:01.600 align:start position:0%
consumers as to how to honor their loved
 
03:49:04.110 --> 03:49:04.120 align:start position:0%
ones after they're passing this is
 
03:49:06.269 --> 03:49:06.279 align:start position:0%
simply an enabling bill that does not
 
03:49:08.790 --> 03:49:08.800 align:start position:0%
alter limit existing disposition methods
 
03:49:09.910 --> 03:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
in any way
 
03:49:11.870 --> 03:49:11.880 align:start position:0%
and does not add requirements to funeral
 
03:49:14.309 --> 03:49:14.319 align:start position:0%
homes that choose not to offer natural
 
03:49:16.630 --> 03:49:16.640 align:start position:0%
organic reduction to their clients
 
03:49:18.510 --> 03:49:18.520 align:start position:0%
instead this bill allows runer homes to
 
03:49:20.429 --> 03:49:20.439 align:start position:0%
work with one of the five companies
 
03:49:22.550 --> 03:49:22.560 align:start position:0%
nationally that provide no to make these
 
03:49:25.030 --> 03:49:25.040 align:start position:0%
services available in their facility or
 
03:49:26.830 --> 03:49:26.840 align:start position:0%
through a partnership following the
 
03:49:29.349 --> 03:49:29.359 align:start position:0%
approach used for Cremation Services
 
03:49:31.950 --> 03:49:31.960 align:start position:0%
numerous Studies have found green burial
 
03:49:33.750 --> 03:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
options to be widely popular with over
 
03:49:35.790 --> 03:49:35.800 align:start position:0%
50% of people in pursuing green burials
 
03:49:37.550 --> 03:49:37.560 align:start position:0%
and techniques like natural organic
 
03:49:39.510 --> 03:49:39.520 align:start position:0%
production some experts even even
 
03:49:41.550 --> 03:49:41.560 align:start position:0%
believe this Market will mature into a
 
03:49:44.229 --> 03:49:44.239 align:start position:0%
billion dollar industry over
 
03:49:46.710 --> 03:49:46.720 align:start position:0%
time many people are not familiar with
 
03:49:48.790 --> 03:49:48.800 align:start position:0%
natural granic reduction and as I have
 
03:49:50.510 --> 03:49:50.520 align:start position:0%
talked to other Representatives friend
 
03:49:52.590 --> 03:49:52.600 align:start position:0%
friends and constituents I've often been
 
03:49:55.349 --> 03:49:55.359 align:start position:0%
asked a few questions such as what
 
03:49:58.229 --> 03:49:58.239 align:start position:0%
happens to the bones the nolr process
 
03:50:00.429 --> 03:50:00.439 align:start position:0%
breaks down the body into nutrient-rich
 
03:50:03.630 --> 03:50:03.640 align:start position:0%
soil and eliminates all traces of DNA
 
03:50:06.229 --> 03:50:06.239 align:start position:0%
however as with cremation bone fragments
 
03:50:07.590 --> 03:50:07.600 align:start position:0%
remain which are reduced into
 
03:50:10.110 --> 03:50:10.120 align:start position:0%
unidentified Dem un identifiable
 
03:50:12.189 --> 03:50:12.199 align:start position:0%
dimensions and added back to the
 
03:50:14.990 --> 03:50:15.000 align:start position:0%
resultant soil to provide additional
 
03:50:17.830 --> 03:50:17.840 align:start position:0%
nutrients this is similar to the process
 
03:50:21.149 --> 03:50:21.159 align:start position:0%
um used for cremation rins um it also
 
03:50:24.070 --> 03:50:24.080 align:start position:0%
includes removing non- Organics like
 
03:50:26.429 --> 03:50:26.439 align:start position:0%
implants what about diseases and
 
03:50:29.309 --> 03:50:29.319 align:start position:0%
bacteria the NR process heats the body
 
03:50:31.710 --> 03:50:31.720 align:start position:0%
to temperatures exceeding 131 degrees
 
03:50:33.950 --> 03:50:33.960 align:start position:0%
for several days eliminating pathogens
 
03:50:35.990 --> 03:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
the resultant soil is tested for
 
03:50:39.269 --> 03:50:39.279 align:start position:0%
contaminants including testing for salon
 
03:50:41.990 --> 03:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
salmonella to ensure pathogens have been
 
03:50:44.309 --> 03:50:44.319 align:start position:0%
destroyed prior to releasing the no soil
 
03:50:48.149 --> 03:50:48.159 align:start position:0%
to the family for worker safety um this
 
03:50:50.229 --> 03:50:50.239 align:start position:0%
uh service cannot be provided to those
 
03:50:52.950 --> 03:50:52.960 align:start position:0%
with a few rare diseases such as Ebola
 
03:50:56.870 --> 03:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
or tuberculosis or those with radiation
 
03:51:01.149 --> 03:51:01.159 align:start position:0%
seed does the process smell the no U
 
03:51:03.189 --> 03:51:03.199 align:start position:0%
natural organic reduction does not smell
 
03:51:05.229 --> 03:51:05.239 align:start position:0%
as microorganisms break down resultant
 
03:51:07.790 --> 03:51:07.800 align:start position:0%
gases into carbon dioxide and water and
 
03:51:10.229 --> 03:51:10.239 align:start position:0%
filters eliminate remaining ERS
 
03:51:11.950 --> 03:51:11.960 align:start position:0%
additionally this bill allows a
 
03:51:13.750 --> 03:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
municipality to restrict the location of
 
03:51:16.149 --> 03:51:16.159 align:start position:0%
no facilities as it does as happens
 
03:51:18.870 --> 03:51:18.880 align:start position:0%
today for cremation facilities um and
 
03:51:21.070 --> 03:51:21.080 align:start position:0%
also requires sending notice to nearby
 
03:51:22.990 --> 03:51:23.000 align:start position:0%
Property Owners prior to establishing an
 
03:51:26.469 --> 03:51:26.479 align:start position:0%
no facility no soil is exactly like
 
03:51:28.750 --> 03:51:28.760 align:start position:0%
other compost in texture and
 
03:51:32.030 --> 03:51:32.040 align:start position:0%
odor what happens to the soil the no
 
03:51:33.510 --> 03:51:33.520 align:start position:0%
process results in approximately
 
03:51:35.510 --> 03:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
approximately one cubic yard of soil
 
03:51:37.950 --> 03:51:37.960 align:start position:0%
about the volume of a pickup truck bed
 
03:51:39.870 --> 03:51:39.880 align:start position:0%
as organic materials are added to help
 
03:51:40.830 --> 03:51:40.840 align:start position:0%
with the
 
03:51:42.870 --> 03:51:42.880 align:start position:0%
transformation while families can take
 
03:51:45.469 --> 03:51:45.479 align:start position:0%
all of the uh soil from their loved ones
 
03:51:47.309 --> 03:51:47.319 align:start position:0%
remains they typically opt for small
 
03:51:49.389 --> 03:51:49.399 align:start position:0%
portion to plant a tree or use in a
 
03:51:52.510 --> 03:51:52.520 align:start position:0%
garden as a memorial an soil cannot be
 
03:51:55.590 --> 03:51:55.600 align:start position:0%
sold or used for growing food instead
 
03:51:57.349 --> 03:51:57.359 align:start position:0%
remaining soil is usually donated to
 
03:51:59.750 --> 03:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
conservation force with establishment
 
03:52:01.830 --> 03:52:01.840 align:start position:0%
with established agreements uh with the
 
03:52:04.950 --> 03:52:04.960 align:start position:0%
no facility this bill requires the no
 
03:52:07.630 --> 03:52:07.640 align:start position:0%
operator to notify the family as to the
 
03:52:10.269 --> 03:52:10.279 align:start position:0%
disposition of unclaimed or
 
03:52:12.630 --> 03:52:12.640 align:start position:0%
soil this bill was drafted following
 
03:52:15.269 --> 03:52:15.279 align:start position:0%
consultation with industry experts the N
 
03:52:16.510 --> 03:52:16.520 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire Funeral Directors
 
03:52:18.870 --> 03:52:18.880 align:start position:0%
Association oplc and the board of
 
03:52:20.870 --> 03:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
funeral directors and EMB bombers the
 
03:52:22.990 --> 03:52:23.000 align:start position:0%
licensure model is uh directly derived
 
03:52:24.590 --> 03:52:24.600 align:start position:0%
from that used for cremation which
 
03:52:26.550 --> 03:52:26.560 align:start position:0%
requires Ru making by the board to
 
03:52:29.750 --> 03:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
regulate no authorities no facilities
 
03:52:31.149 --> 03:52:31.159 align:start position:0%
and no
 
03:52:33.309 --> 03:52:33.319 align:start position:0%
operators while this bill contains a
 
03:52:35.910 --> 03:52:35.920 align:start position:0%
fiscal note oplc indicated the cost
 
03:52:37.910 --> 03:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
related to licensing could be absorbed
 
03:52:39.950 --> 03:52:39.960 align:start position:0%
in their existing budget
 
03:52:42.110 --> 03:52:42.120 align:start position:0%
as rules must be adopted before natural
 
03:52:43.950 --> 03:52:43.960 align:start position:0%
organic reduction can be licensed there
 
03:52:46.710 --> 03:52:46.720 align:start position:0%
are no near-term expenditures if natural
 
03:52:49.309 --> 03:52:49.319 align:start position:0%
organic reduction became wildly popular
 
03:52:50.950 --> 03:52:50.960 align:start position:0%
to the level of adoption of cremation
 
03:52:53.349 --> 03:52:53.359 align:start position:0%
today additional staff for a clerk and
 
03:52:54.990 --> 03:52:55.000 align:start position:0%
inspector Could Be Imagined but
 
03:52:57.070 --> 03:52:57.080 align:start position:0%
realistically in the foreseeable future
 
03:53:00.110 --> 03:53:00.120 align:start position:0%
a very small number of no oper oper
 
03:53:02.710 --> 03:53:02.720 align:start position:0%
facilities maybe only one would be
 
03:53:04.830 --> 03:53:04.840 align:start position:0%
introduced which could in all likelihood
 
03:53:07.790 --> 03:53:07.800 align:start position:0%
be handled by opl C's existing staff
 
03:53:08.990 --> 03:53:09.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for your attention and
 
03:53:11.110 --> 03:53:11.120 align:start position:0%
interest in this bill I hope you agree
 
03:53:13.590 --> 03:53:13.600 align:start position:0%
this bill simply provides more options
 
03:53:15.670 --> 03:53:15.680 align:start position:0%
to remember and honor our loved ones as
 
03:53:17.469 --> 03:53:17.479 align:start position:0%
well as opening new markets to Funeral
 
03:53:19.630 --> 03:53:19.640 align:start position:0%
Home operators of course I'll be happy
 
03:53:21.750 --> 03:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
to take
 
03:53:23.630 --> 03:53:23.640 align:start position:0%
questions repr
 
03:53:27.630 --> 03:53:27.640 align:start position:0%
black uh thank you um just
 
03:53:30.030 --> 03:53:30.040 align:start position:0%
curious just in general terms what's the
 
03:53:32.550 --> 03:53:32.560 align:start position:0%
cost of doing this compared to let's say
 
03:53:36.790 --> 03:53:36.800 align:start position:0%
cremation um so cremation um at the low
 
03:53:39.070 --> 03:53:39.080 align:start position:0%
end of cremation I understand is about 2
 
03:53:42.590 --> 03:53:42.600 align:start position:0%
,000 um the average price that I've read
 
03:53:44.389 --> 03:53:44.399 align:start position:0%
um can be up to about
 
03:53:48.189 --> 03:53:48.199 align:start position:0%
$6,000 um a full burial is um the
 
03:53:51.510 --> 03:53:51.520 align:start position:0%
average price I've read is $8 to $9,000
 
03:53:53.910 --> 03:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
this is going to fall in the 8,000 about
 
03:53:57.670 --> 03:53:57.680 align:start position:0%
$8,000 range good thank you
 
03:54:00.229 --> 03:54:00.239 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much for your
 
03:54:04.030 --> 03:54:04.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:06.429 --> 03:54:06.439 align:start position:0%
 oh sorry D excuse me
 
03:54:12.630 --> 03:54:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:16.269 --> 03:54:16.279 align:start position:0%
thank you just just briefly um there's a
 
03:54:21.229 --> 03:54:21.239 align:start position:0%
reference uh in your uh paper about um
 
03:54:24.630 --> 03:54:24.640 align:start position:0%
bodies with a radiation seed is that one
 
03:54:27.189 --> 03:54:27.199 align:start position:0%
of those items where they try and Trace
 
03:54:30.750 --> 03:54:30.760 align:start position:0%
through your body various um am I
 
03:54:32.510 --> 03:54:32.520 align:start position:0%
understanding that
 
03:54:35.830 --> 03:54:35.840 align:start position:0%
correctly to to be uh truthful I'm not a
 
03:54:37.710 --> 03:54:37.720 align:start position:0%
medical expert in this area but what I
 
03:54:41.349 --> 03:54:41.359 align:start position:0%
did read is is that um active radiation
 
03:54:43.189 --> 03:54:43.199 align:start position:0%
in the body for example if you have an
 
03:54:45.750 --> 03:54:45.760 align:start position:0%
active seed that is irradiating or
 
03:54:48.550 --> 03:54:48.560 align:start position:0%
you've had act uh very recent radiation
 
03:54:52.149 --> 03:54:52.159 align:start position:0%
treatment would disqualify the body so
 
03:54:54.990 --> 03:54:55.000 align:start position:0%
okay that was my next question if you
 
03:54:57.750 --> 03:54:57.760 align:start position:0%
have gone undergone radiation for cancer
 
03:54:59.550 --> 03:54:59.560 align:start position:0%
treatment and so forth that would
 
03:55:03.870 --> 03:55:03.880 align:start position:0%
disqualify you it it would um it would
 
03:55:06.229 --> 03:55:06.239 align:start position:0%
be within something like the last 30
 
03:55:08.910 --> 03:55:08.920 align:start position:0%
days I can't recall the exact timeline
 
03:55:11.790 --> 03:55:11.800 align:start position:0%
but um normal radiation like for cancer
 
03:55:14.309 --> 03:55:14.319 align:start position:0%
dissipates over time the this radiation
 
03:55:16.110 --> 03:55:16.120 align:start position:0%
seed as I understand it something they
 
03:55:17.790 --> 03:55:17.800 align:start position:0%
actually implant in the body that
 
03:55:20.790 --> 03:55:20.800 align:start position:0%
actively um actively radiates the body
 
03:55:23.070 --> 03:55:23.080 align:start position:0%
and so because it's act there's an
 
03:55:25.189 --> 03:55:25.199 align:start position:0%
active radiation at the time of death
 
03:55:27.469 --> 03:55:27.479 align:start position:0%
that would disqualify the body as if you
 
03:55:29.510 --> 03:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
the same way as if you had a radiation
 
03:55:31.510 --> 03:55:31.520 align:start position:0%
treatment the week before you
 
03:55:35.670 --> 03:55:35.680 align:start position:0%
passed thank you thank
 
03:55:37.790 --> 03:55:37.800 align:start position:0%
you okay Mr
 
03:55:37.800 --> 03:55:51.189 align:start position:0%
you okay Mr
Moren

03:55:51.189 --> 03:55:51.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:54.070 --> 03:55:54.080 align:start position:0%
that's there we go uh good sorry good
 
03:55:57.030 --> 03:55:57.040 align:start position:0%
afternoon uh representative Maguire and
 
03:55:59.790 --> 03:55:59.800 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee uh my name
 
03:56:03.590 --> 03:56:03.600 align:start position:0%
is Peter Moren I am the executive uh uh
 
03:56:05.189 --> 03:56:05.199 align:start position:0%
director of the New Hampshire funeral
 
03:56:06.870 --> 03:56:06.880 align:start position:0%
directors and bombers Association here
 
03:56:08.269 --> 03:56:08.279 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire you may have seen me
 
03:56:10.670 --> 03:56:10.680 align:start position:0%
another committee hearings in the past
 
03:56:13.469 --> 03:56:13.479 align:start position:0%
uh and uh I'm also a licensed New
 
03:56:16.269 --> 03:56:16.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire field director n Balmer and uh
 
03:56:17.670 --> 03:56:17.680 align:start position:0%
I've been doing this for the association
 
03:56:20.389 --> 03:56:20.399 align:start position:0%
for the past 16 years and I'm here today
 
03:56:22.229 --> 03:56:22.239 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the association to speak in
 
03:56:23.590 --> 03:56:23.600 align:start position:0%
opposition to the bill the way it's
 
03:56:26.790 --> 03:56:26.800 align:start position:0%
written uh initially we met with the the
 
03:56:29.670 --> 03:56:29.680 align:start position:0%
sponsors of the bill back last fall and
 
03:56:31.469 --> 03:56:31.479 align:start position:0%
we did have some discussions with them
 
03:56:34.030 --> 03:56:34.040 align:start position:0%
initially it looked at first glance to
 
03:56:35.630 --> 03:56:35.640 align:start position:0%
be pretty straightforward but then the
 
03:56:37.349 --> 03:56:37.359 align:start position:0%
more I researched that and and really
 
03:56:40.550 --> 03:56:40.560 align:start position:0%
dug into it um having lost my brother
 
03:56:42.229 --> 03:56:42.239 align:start position:0%
back in September there was a period
 
03:56:44.189 --> 03:56:44.199 align:start position:0%
there where I wasn't really doing a lot
 
03:56:46.630 --> 03:56:46.640 align:start position:0%
but I've uh I'm back on on my uh on
 
03:56:48.269 --> 03:56:48.279 align:start position:0%
track again here and we've really
 
03:56:51.910 --> 03:56:51.920 align:start position:0%
researched this very carefully and um
 
03:56:54.550 --> 03:56:54.560 align:start position:0%
let me just uh get my things here watch
 
03:56:58.030 --> 03:56:58.040 align:start position:0%
my notes here so I don't drift off
 
03:57:00.510 --> 03:57:00.520 align:start position:0%
um and what I'm here to represent is the
 
03:57:02.309 --> 03:57:02.319 align:start position:0%
concerns and questions from our members
 
03:57:05.229 --> 03:57:05.239 align:start position:0%
we had our our uh our annual meeting
 
03:57:09.030 --> 03:57:09.040 align:start position:0%
back on uh January 14th uh 13th actually
 
03:57:11.030 --> 03:57:11.040 align:start position:0%
in Meredith New Hampshire and over half
 
03:57:12.510 --> 03:57:12.520 align:start position:0%
of the fial directors in the state were
 
03:57:15.790 --> 03:57:15.800 align:start position:0%
there for our annual meeting um the
 
03:57:18.349 --> 03:57:18.359 align:start position:0%
overall uh concerns which I'll address
 
03:57:22.590 --> 03:57:22.600 align:start position:0%
here briefly um were raised U that there
 
03:57:24.510 --> 03:57:24.520 align:start position:0%
was a general consensus that there was
 
03:57:26.349 --> 03:57:26.359 align:start position:0%
no need for this that they hadn't seen a
 
03:57:28.670 --> 03:57:28.680 align:start position:0%
demand for this or any interest in it uh
 
03:57:30.389 --> 03:57:30.399 align:start position:0%
and there were concerns about custody
 
03:57:32.429 --> 03:57:32.439 align:start position:0%
and control and about uh chain of
 
03:57:34.750 --> 03:57:34.760 align:start position:0%
custody and basically the other things
 
03:57:37.389 --> 03:57:37.399 align:start position:0%
that came up in our our discussions were
 
03:57:40.429 --> 03:57:40.439 align:start position:0%
potential environmental ISS issues um I
 
03:57:41.990 --> 03:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
guess primarily is
 
03:57:45.990 --> 03:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
that and I like to use the term human as
 
03:57:48.309 --> 03:57:48.319 align:start position:0%
composting you know we have where great
 
03:57:50.630 --> 03:57:50.640 align:start position:0%
ones even Funeral Directors were guilty
 
03:57:52.790 --> 03:57:52.800 align:start position:0%
of using a lot of euphemisms you know we
 
03:57:55.070 --> 03:57:55.080 align:start position:0%
like to it makes it sound nicer and
 
03:57:56.870 --> 03:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
everything we call it natural organic
 
03:57:59.429 --> 03:57:59.439 align:start position:0%
reduction um you know that could be what
 
03:58:01.070 --> 03:58:01.080 align:start position:0%
occurs in a green barrial could be
 
03:58:04.269 --> 03:58:04.279 align:start position:0%
occurs in any number of situations but
 
03:58:06.950 --> 03:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
um our concern here too is that the term
 
03:58:10.189 --> 03:58:10.199 align:start position:0%
natural organic reduction and no which
 
03:58:11.429 --> 03:58:11.439 align:start position:0%
are always
 
03:58:13.790 --> 03:58:13.800 align:start position:0%
capitalized um is it could be a
 
03:58:15.950 --> 03:58:15.960 align:start position:0%
copyrighted term could be owned by
 
03:58:18.510 --> 03:58:18.520 align:start position:0%
someone uh I haven't researched that we
 
03:58:20.189 --> 03:58:20.199 align:start position:0%
want I would we would prefer that
 
03:58:22.630 --> 03:58:22.640 align:start position:0%
generic terms be used and call it human
 
03:58:26.030 --> 03:58:26.040 align:start position:0%
composting the previous statute 325A
 
03:58:28.750 --> 03:58:28.760 align:start position:0%
which is our cremation statutes are uh
 
03:58:30.429 --> 03:58:30.439 align:start position:0%
you know Cremation of human remains and
 
03:58:32.269 --> 03:58:32.279 align:start position:0%
that we call this composting human
 
03:58:35.550 --> 03:58:35.560 align:start position:0%
remains just say call it what it is uh
 
03:58:37.149 --> 03:58:37.159 align:start position:0%
you know we don't need to do anything to
 
03:58:39.110 --> 03:58:39.120 align:start position:0%
confuse the the public
 
03:58:40.710 --> 03:58:40.720 align:start position:0%
uh into this is something same thing
 
03:58:42.790 --> 03:58:42.800 align:start position:0%
with alkaline hydrolysis when we talked
 
03:58:45.910 --> 03:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
about that years ago um is that you know
 
03:58:48.110 --> 03:58:48.120 align:start position:0%
the terms were resummation and this well
 
03:58:50.030 --> 03:58:50.040 align:start position:0%
what is it no it's alkaline hydrolysis
 
03:58:52.349 --> 03:58:52.359 align:start position:0%
okay we can figure out how that process
 
03:58:55.870 --> 03:58:55.880 align:start position:0%
works that's one of our concerns um and
 
03:58:57.950 --> 03:58:57.960 align:start position:0%
of course this is a it's funny I've
 
03:59:00.710 --> 03:59:00.720 align:start position:0%
heard a 4 to 8 to 12we process with
 
03:59:03.030 --> 03:59:03.040 align:start position:0%
natural organic reduction or with human
 
03:59:05.269 --> 03:59:05.279 align:start position:0%
composting and we're not clear how long
 
03:59:09.149 --> 03:59:09.159 align:start position:0%
it actually does take um and as far as
 
03:59:11.189 --> 03:59:11.199 align:start position:0%
you know to the average person this may
 
03:59:13.870 --> 03:59:13.880 align:start position:0%
sound like a very basic straightforward
 
03:59:16.389 --> 03:59:16.399 align:start position:0%
uh biologically sound kind of a holistic
 
03:59:18.550 --> 03:59:18.560 align:start position:0%
approach you know I mean it kind of you
 
03:59:20.910 --> 03:59:20.920 align:start position:0%
know might make you feel good and and I
 
03:59:22.309 --> 03:59:22.319 align:start position:0%
understand that everyone is looking for
 
03:59:25.469 --> 03:59:25.479 align:start position:0%
something different here and but I don't
 
03:59:27.229 --> 03:59:27.239 align:start position:0%
think it's nearly that simple we're
 
03:59:28.590 --> 03:59:28.600 align:start position:0%
concerned that there's a lot more this
 
03:59:31.510 --> 03:59:31.520 align:start position:0%
is a relatively new process in terms of
 
03:59:34.590 --> 03:59:34.600 align:start position:0%
human uh disposition of human bodies
 
03:59:36.429 --> 03:59:36.439 align:start position:0%
been using it in agricultural now for
 
03:59:39.030 --> 03:59:39.040 align:start position:0%
several decades in for farming animals
 
03:59:40.389 --> 03:59:40.399 align:start position:0%
which I won't go into that that's not
 
03:59:43.189 --> 03:59:43.199 align:start position:0%
the scope of this hearing um you know
 
03:59:45.750 --> 03:59:45.760 align:start position:0%
it's done quite differently there um but
 
03:59:47.389 --> 03:59:47.399 align:start position:0%
here you know we are worried about the
 
03:59:49.309 --> 03:59:49.319 align:start position:0%
the soil and the water and any uh
 
03:59:51.189 --> 03:59:51.199 align:start position:0%
possible air contamination because there
 
03:59:53.070 --> 03:59:53.080 align:start position:0%
is you know there's a process of
 
03:59:54.710 --> 03:59:54.720 align:start position:0%
maintaining the right temperatures
 
03:59:57.149 --> 03:59:57.159 align:start position:0%
there's ventilation in these systems and
 
03:59:59.229 --> 03:59:59.239 align:start position:0%
then of course what we're dealing with
 
04:00:01.030 --> 04:00:01.040 align:start position:0%
afterwards you know they refer to it as
 
04:00:03.110 --> 04:00:03.120 align:start position:0%
a soil but you're going to have the
 
04:00:05.550 --> 04:00:05.560 align:start position:0%
byproducts of every part of that
 
04:00:07.389 --> 04:00:07.399 align:start position:0%
decomposition of that body because
 
04:00:08.710 --> 04:00:08.720 align:start position:0%
that's really what we're talking about
 
04:00:10.349 --> 04:00:10.359 align:start position:0%
is the decomposition of the body
 
04:00:12.149 --> 04:00:12.159 align:start position:0%
breaking down our body and back into the
 
04:00:13.950 --> 04:00:13.960 align:start position:0%
most basic elements those are all going
 
04:00:16.149 --> 04:00:16.159 align:start position:0%
to be contained in this soil or whatever
 
04:00:18.110 --> 04:00:18.120 align:start position:0%
this product is that that comes
 
04:00:21.110 --> 04:00:21.120 align:start position:0%
afterwards uh the long bones as in
 
04:00:24.110 --> 04:00:24.120 align:start position:0%
cremation will survive this process 3
 
04:00:27.309 --> 04:00:27.319 align:start position:0%
months is nearly not enough uh and I do
 
04:00:29.550 --> 04:00:29.560 align:start position:0%
raise the question I believe that DNA is
 
04:00:32.469 --> 04:00:32.479 align:start position:0%
still held in the bones they found that
 
04:00:34.870 --> 04:00:34.880 align:start position:0%
in in ancient Graves they're able to
 
04:00:37.950 --> 04:00:37.960 align:start position:0%
extract DNA from uh individuals who were
 
04:00:40.110 --> 04:00:40.120 align:start position:0%
buried for hundreds if not thousands of
 
04:00:44.030 --> 04:00:44.040 align:start position:0%
years uh and uh apparently um anyway
 
04:00:45.389 --> 04:00:45.399 align:start position:0%
there's other issues like that that
 
04:00:47.830 --> 04:00:47.840 align:start position:0%
we're we're concerned about um the cost
 
04:00:49.389 --> 04:00:49.399 align:start position:0%
efficiency doesn't well you know it
 
04:00:52.070 --> 04:00:52.080 align:start position:0%
isn't the most cost effective thing and
 
04:00:55.469 --> 04:00:55.479 align:start position:0%
that's up to the individual um mainly
 
04:00:57.229 --> 04:00:57.239 align:start position:0%
again then the other issue would be uh
 
04:00:59.349 --> 04:00:59.359 align:start position:0%
soil the transportation of this material
 
04:01:01.110 --> 04:01:01.120 align:start position:0%
and where it goes right now the bill
 
04:01:03.030 --> 04:01:03.040 align:start position:0%
would state that it just it can be
 
04:01:05.149 --> 04:01:05.159 align:start position:0%
placed anywhere with permission of the
 
04:01:07.550 --> 04:01:07.560 align:start position:0%
landowner well you know that can occur
 
04:01:08.990 --> 04:01:09.000 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
04:01:11.070 --> 04:01:11.080 align:start position:0%
without anyone knowing about it you know
 
04:01:13.349 --> 04:01:13.359 align:start position:0%
as far as EPA and and the uh Department
 
04:01:16.590 --> 04:01:16.600 align:start position:0%
of Environmental Services um that you
 
04:01:17.910 --> 04:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
know we're not talking about a small
 
04:01:21.750 --> 04:01:21.760 align:start position:0%
amount of material um and then of course
 
04:01:23.950 --> 04:01:23.960 align:start position:0%
in terms of coming out of the pandemic
 
04:01:25.670 --> 04:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
as we did we realized that you know what
 
04:01:28.550 --> 04:01:28.560 align:start position:0%
we need is an effective means of taking
 
04:01:31.189 --> 04:01:31.199 align:start position:0%
care of our dead and cremation our
 
04:01:33.309 --> 04:01:33.319 align:start position:0%
crematories were we stayed ahead of
 
04:01:34.710 --> 04:01:34.720 align:start position:0%
everything during the because we weren't
 
04:01:37.229 --> 04:01:37.239 align:start position:0%
hit with a uh with a surge like other
 
04:01:39.030 --> 04:01:39.040 align:start position:0%
states were but we had other states
 
04:01:40.910 --> 04:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and Connecticut who are
 
04:01:43.030 --> 04:01:43.040 align:start position:0%
transporting their dead to New Hampshire
 
04:01:45.389 --> 04:01:45.399 align:start position:0%
to use our crematories because the
 
04:01:47.070 --> 04:01:47.080 align:start position:0%
cremation can be done in a Four 3 to
 
04:01:49.269 --> 04:01:49.279 align:start position:0%
four hour period turn them around they
 
04:01:51.189 --> 04:01:51.199 align:start position:0%
could bring several individuals up and
 
04:01:53.510 --> 04:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
pick them up a few days later uh their
 
04:01:55.950 --> 04:01:55.960 align:start position:0%
crated remains it would be very
 
04:01:57.790 --> 04:01:57.800 align:start position:0%
effective I mean from a business
 
04:02:00.429 --> 04:02:00.439 align:start position:0%
perspective this I don't think has a lot
 
04:02:02.229 --> 04:02:02.239 align:start position:0%
of appeal because of the sheer amount of
 
04:02:04.349 --> 04:02:04.359 align:start position:0%
time that it takes in order to
 
04:02:06.269 --> 04:02:06.279 align:start position:0%
accommodate uh an individual and that's
 
04:02:08.510 --> 04:02:08.520 align:start position:0%
up to the individual uh situation of
 
04:02:10.590 --> 04:02:10.600 align:start position:0%
course uh they did mention that you know
 
04:02:12.670 --> 04:02:12.680 align:start position:0%
there seven states I only had six but I
 
04:02:14.510 --> 04:02:14.520 align:start position:0%
guess there's one more but among them
 
04:02:16.590 --> 04:02:16.600 align:start position:0%
are Vermont and Massachusetts and then
 
04:02:18.590 --> 04:02:18.600 align:start position:0%
New York a little further away so we
 
04:02:20.830 --> 04:02:20.840 align:start position:0%
have two neighboring states who have
 
04:02:23.670 --> 04:02:23.680 align:start position:0%
approved this but over a year later
 
04:02:25.429 --> 04:02:25.439 align:start position:0%
there and I spoke with my colleagues in
 
04:02:27.590 --> 04:02:27.600 align:start position:0%
those uh in Vermont massachusett they're
 
04:02:30.710 --> 04:02:30.720 align:start position:0%
still working on their regulations after
 
04:02:33.790 --> 04:02:33.800 align:start position:0%
a year they're still kind of slogging
 
04:02:35.189 --> 04:02:35.199 align:start position:0%
their way through the regulations so
 
04:02:36.670 --> 04:02:36.680 align:start position:0%
that tells me there's a there may be
 
04:02:40.790 --> 04:02:40.800 align:start position:0%
more to this then meets the eye uh and
 
04:02:43.670 --> 04:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
uh so of course here it's it's a little
 
04:02:45.790 --> 04:02:45.800 align:start position:0%
confusing too because we're dealing with
 
04:02:47.429 --> 04:02:47.439 align:start position:0%
two different statutes you know we're
 
04:02:49.630 --> 04:02:49.640 align:start position:0%
dealing with a new section
 
04:02:53.830 --> 04:02:53.840 align:start position:0%
325b which I understand you know mimics
 
04:02:56.990 --> 04:02:57.000 align:start position:0%
if not duplicates the The Cremation
 
04:02:59.950 --> 04:02:59.960 align:start position:0%
Statute in that it just interchanges
 
04:03:01.870 --> 04:03:01.880 align:start position:0%
cremation and other similar words for
 
04:03:03.630 --> 04:03:03.640 align:start position:0%
the natural organic reduction or the
 
04:03:05.950 --> 04:03:05.960 align:start position:0%
human composting but we can't
 
04:03:08.349 --> 04:03:08.359 align:start position:0%
interchange these two processes there
 
04:03:10.630 --> 04:03:10.640 align:start position:0%
very very different incredibly different
 
04:03:11.870 --> 04:03:11.880 align:start position:0%
particularly when it comes to the
 
04:03:13.910 --> 04:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
disposition or the scattering of this
 
04:03:16.830 --> 04:03:16.840 align:start position:0%
material um again as they' said you know
 
04:03:19.269 --> 04:03:19.279 align:start position:0%
in cremation what remains after
 
04:03:22.070 --> 04:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
cremation and of course cremation occurs
 
04:03:25.950 --> 04:03:25.960 align:start position:0%
between 1500 and 18800 degrees it's hot
 
04:03:28.469 --> 04:03:28.479 align:start position:0%
okay everything uh the container the
 
04:03:30.870 --> 04:03:30.880 align:start position:0%
body is in whatever clothing whatever
 
04:03:32.670 --> 04:03:32.680 align:start position:0%
things they're doing those are consumed
 
04:03:34.830 --> 04:03:34.840 align:start position:0%
first in the process that's gone and
 
04:03:37.070 --> 04:03:37.080 align:start position:0%
then All That Remains are the the
 
04:03:37.080 --> 04:03:38.830 align:start position:0%
then All That Remains are the the
calcified

04:03:38.830 --> 04:03:38.840 align:start position:0%
calcified
 
04:03:40.990 --> 04:03:41.000 align:start position:0%
large bones that are left and they are
 
04:03:42.990 --> 04:03:43.000 align:start position:0%
very brittle because of extreme heat
 
04:03:44.750 --> 04:03:44.760 align:start position:0%
those are broken down in a process and
 
04:03:46.990 --> 04:03:47.000 align:start position:0%
pulverized into a uniform size so
 
04:03:49.990 --> 04:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
they'll fit into a container uh an urn
 
04:03:51.429 --> 04:03:51.439 align:start position:0%
or something similar to that you know I
 
04:03:54.389 --> 04:03:54.399 align:start position:0%
always joke and say a 2B coffee can if
 
04:03:57.189 --> 04:03:57.199 align:start position:0%
anyone uses bulk coffee anymore would
 
04:03:59.469 --> 04:03:59.479 align:start position:0%
accommodate that 5 to six pounds very
 
04:04:02.070 --> 04:04:02.080 align:start position:0%
easily with this with the material and
 
04:04:04.590 --> 04:04:04.600 align:start position:0%
we're talking about a cubic yard now I
 
04:04:06.469 --> 04:04:06.479 align:start position:0%
know most everybody in New Hampshire
 
04:04:08.750 --> 04:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
probably has a pickup truck or or they
 
04:04:11.110 --> 04:04:11.120 align:start position:0%
know someone that does so you know but
 
04:04:13.149 --> 04:04:13.159 align:start position:0%
again we're wondering what you know if
 
04:04:15.030 --> 04:04:15.040 align:start position:0%
there's anything in this if there's any
 
04:04:16.910 --> 04:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
environmental issue does this envir
 
04:04:19.710 --> 04:04:19.720 align:start position:0%
involve either Department of V vital
 
04:04:22.149 --> 04:04:22.159 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services or
 
04:04:25.070 --> 04:04:25.080 align:start position:0%
EPA or the uh the
 
04:04:28.149 --> 04:04:28.159 align:start position:0%
USDA and uh but having the same
 
04:04:30.110 --> 04:04:30.120 align:start position:0%
requirements for for scattering which is
 
04:04:31.429 --> 04:04:31.439 align:start position:0%
placed into
 
04:04:35.910 --> 04:04:35.920 align:start position:0%
289 um would would again would lump the
 
04:04:39.710 --> 04:04:39.720 align:start position:0%
uh crem cremations with the this organic
 
04:04:43.030 --> 04:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
this composting soil
 
04:04:45.710 --> 04:04:45.720 align:start position:0%
um let's see just don't want to repeat
 
04:04:48.189 --> 04:04:48.199 align:start position:0%
here I've already covered that and of
 
04:04:49.830 --> 04:04:49.840 align:start position:0%
course you know New Hampshire has an 80%
 
04:04:51.990 --> 04:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
creation rate which is is rising all the
 
04:04:54.070 --> 04:04:54.080 align:start position:0%
time and they're always going to be
 
04:04:56.269 --> 04:04:56.279 align:start position:0%
those who want to have a traditional
 
04:04:59.349 --> 04:04:59.359 align:start position:0%
burial and uh and they're those who will
 
04:05:01.229 --> 04:05:01.239 align:start position:0%
donate their body or science or they'll
 
04:05:03.309 --> 04:05:03.319 align:start position:0%
they will leave they'll be taken to you
 
04:05:05.830 --> 04:05:05.840 align:start position:0%
know another state for their disposition
 
04:05:07.590 --> 04:05:07.600 align:start position:0%
I've always said in funeral service that
 
04:05:10.469 --> 04:05:10.479 align:start position:0%
when people die they go home you know a
 
04:05:11.870 --> 04:05:11.880 align:start position:0%
few people that die in Florida who came
 
04:05:13.590 --> 04:05:13.600 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire they they tend to
 
04:05:17.110 --> 04:05:17.120 align:start position:0%
come back um so there's other other
 
04:05:19.710 --> 04:05:19.720 align:start position:0%
issues there I do want to just address
 
04:05:21.590 --> 04:05:21.600 align:start position:0%
before I close I do want to address a
 
04:05:24.149 --> 04:05:24.159 align:start position:0%
few of my concerns here that came up you
 
04:05:26.189 --> 04:05:26.199 align:start position:0%
know we we kind of discussed this last
 
04:05:28.309 --> 04:05:28.319 align:start position:0%
year with another bill and I just want
 
04:05:30.189 --> 04:05:30.199 align:start position:0%
to clarify some of this you know I know
 
04:05:33.110 --> 04:05:33.120 align:start position:0%
we're we're kind of nobody
 
04:05:35.429 --> 04:05:35.439 align:start position:0%
wants you know nobody wants the funeral
 
04:05:36.870 --> 04:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
director sitting next to them in the
 
04:05:38.550 --> 04:05:38.560 align:start position:0%
reception after the the funeral you know
 
04:05:40.189 --> 04:05:40.199 align:start position:0%
it's like it's like a priest once told
 
04:05:42.469 --> 04:05:42.479 align:start position:0%
me no one wants the the clergy sitting
 
04:05:44.269 --> 04:05:44.279 align:start position:0%
with them in a wedding
 
04:05:46.590 --> 04:05:46.600 align:start position:0%
reception so they've already seen enough
 
04:05:48.790 --> 04:05:48.800 align:start position:0%
of us but they're misconceptions here
 
04:05:50.870 --> 04:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
often and we're kind of often made to
 
04:05:54.030 --> 04:05:54.040 align:start position:0%
look like the bad guy and we tend to try
 
04:05:56.389 --> 04:05:56.399 align:start position:0%
or the bad woman but we tend to try we
 
04:05:58.110 --> 04:05:58.120 align:start position:0%
do our best to help the families in in
 
04:06:00.469 --> 04:06:00.479 align:start position:0%
the State uh we have a real sense of
 
04:06:05.110 --> 04:06:05.120 align:start position:0%
service and Duty um basically
 
04:06:08.550 --> 04:06:08.560 align:start position:0%
uh we're very careful in our funeral
 
04:06:09.830 --> 04:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
service and here in New Hampshire
 
04:06:11.429 --> 04:06:11.439 align:start position:0%
particularly is that we're not in a
 
04:06:13.590 --> 04:06:13.600 align:start position:0%
position we don't want to dictate what
 
04:06:16.429 --> 04:06:16.439 align:start position:0%
any individual should do or shouldn't do
 
04:06:18.990 --> 04:06:19.000 align:start position:0%
or in this case what the cemeteries
 
04:06:21.149 --> 04:06:21.159 align:start position:0%
should or shouldn't do you know each
 
04:06:23.910 --> 04:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
each city or town dictates their own
 
04:06:25.389 --> 04:06:25.399 align:start position:0%
controls their own cemeteries now we're
 
04:06:26.590 --> 04:06:26.600 align:start position:0%
not going to tell them what they need to
 
04:06:28.910 --> 04:06:28.920 align:start position:0%
do there are some cemeteries in New
 
04:06:30.750 --> 04:06:30.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that provide for green
 
04:06:34.030 --> 04:06:34.040 align:start position:0%
burial and of course there is nothing in
 
04:06:36.710 --> 04:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
our statute that prohibits green Barrel
 
04:06:38.870 --> 04:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
alkaline hydrolysis is prohibited
 
04:06:41.229 --> 04:06:41.239 align:start position:0%
expressly as a result of a legislative
 
04:06:44.510 --> 04:06:44.520 align:start position:0%
issue a few years ago and but there's
 
04:06:45.990 --> 04:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
nothing that prohibits green burial or
 
04:06:47.790 --> 04:06:47.800 align:start position:0%
you doing that that process on your own
 
04:06:50.229 --> 04:06:50.239 align:start position:0%
property and so forth uh and if the
 
04:06:52.910 --> 04:06:52.920 align:start position:0%
cemetery offers that space then then you
 
04:06:56.229 --> 04:06:56.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:59.670 --> 04:06:59.680 align:start position:0%
um and that also there's no requirement
 
04:07:01.149 --> 04:07:01.159 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire that you
 
04:07:04.630 --> 04:07:04.640 align:start position:0%
must be embalmed the only part of the
 
04:07:07.510 --> 04:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
statute actually it's in the rules that
 
04:07:09.710 --> 04:07:09.720 align:start position:0%
if you're going to be inomed for the
 
04:07:12.710 --> 04:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
winter okay between for a spring burial
 
04:07:14.349 --> 04:07:14.359 align:start position:0%
because many cemeteries particularly the
 
04:07:17.269 --> 04:07:17.279 align:start position:0%
small ones Clos for the winter you know
 
04:07:18.710 --> 04:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
we didn't often don't have an open
 
04:07:21.349 --> 04:07:21.359 align:start position:0%
winter like we do this year uh and many
 
04:07:23.550 --> 04:07:23.560 align:start position:0%
of these old cemeteries are very small
 
04:07:25.950 --> 04:07:25.960 align:start position:0%
very hard to negotiate even in the
 
04:07:28.149 --> 04:07:28.159 align:start position:0%
summertime uh and of course these were
 
04:07:29.950 --> 04:07:29.960 align:start position:0%
cemeteries were set up back when Graves
 
04:07:32.590 --> 04:07:32.600 align:start position:0%
were dug by hand and even then they
 
04:07:34.429 --> 04:07:34.439 align:start position:0%
would hold these bodies over for the
 
04:07:35.870 --> 04:07:35.880 align:start position:0%
spring Barrel because the ground was
 
04:07:38.550 --> 04:07:38.560 align:start position:0%
frozen solid bigger cemeteries have the
 
04:07:40.670 --> 04:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
means to thaw that and do that city of
 
04:07:43.149 --> 04:07:43.159 align:start position:0%
keing down where I'm from they bury year
 
04:07:45.550 --> 04:07:45.560 align:start position:0%
round but that's a cemetery issue it's
 
04:07:47.510 --> 04:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
not for us to dictate what they do or
 
04:07:47.520 --> 04:07:48.670 align:start position:0%
not for us to dictate what they do or
don't

04:07:48.670 --> 04:07:48.680 align:start position:0%
don't
 
04:07:51.269 --> 04:07:51.279 align:start position:0%
do what I said last year when we had
 
04:07:53.109 --> 04:07:53.119 align:start position:0%
another bill talking about EMB bombing
 
04:07:54.750 --> 04:07:54.760 align:start position:0%
and it was really basically about green
 
04:07:57.030 --> 04:07:57.040 align:start position:0%
burial and I I'm going to say it again
 
04:07:58.950 --> 04:07:58.960 align:start position:0%
is that why doesn't someone who's
 
04:08:02.109 --> 04:08:02.119 align:start position:0%
interested in this or a group of people
 
04:08:06.550 --> 04:08:06.560 align:start position:0%
get together and form have a establish a
 
04:08:09.870 --> 04:08:09.880 align:start position:0%
a New Hampshire green burial uh cemetery
 
04:08:11.710 --> 04:08:11.720 align:start position:0%
and just have it so it's like with our
 
04:08:14.070 --> 04:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire veterans cemetery there's
 
04:08:15.910 --> 04:08:15.920 align:start position:0%
that one you know which covers all of
 
04:08:18.030 --> 04:08:18.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire but there could be a
 
04:08:20.109 --> 04:08:20.119 align:start position:0%
private Cemetery that would offer this
 
04:08:22.510 --> 04:08:22.520 align:start position:0%
to to individuals who who wanted to have
 
04:08:24.790 --> 04:08:24.800 align:start position:0%
it rather than trying to get every city
 
04:08:28.149 --> 04:08:28.159 align:start position:0%
in town you know to forcing them to do
 
04:08:30.670 --> 04:08:30.680 align:start position:0%
this uh that's not an argument I want to
 
04:08:32.670 --> 04:08:32.680 align:start position:0%
be in you know I know I come from a
 
04:08:36.670 --> 04:08:36.680 align:start position:0%
small town of sui and uh and the other
 
04:08:38.429 --> 04:08:38.439 align:start position:0%
question is that the other thing I want
 
04:08:41.790 --> 04:08:41.800 align:start position:0%
to clarify is that as far as private
 
04:08:43.510 --> 04:08:43.520 align:start position:0%
burial I know yes it's permitted in the
 
04:08:45.710 --> 04:08:45.720 align:start position:0%
state has been for a very long time the
 
04:08:48.590 --> 04:08:48.600 align:start position:0%
last I did check is that there was is no
 
04:08:51.229 --> 04:08:51.239 align:start position:0%
longer an acreage requirement the main
 
04:08:52.750 --> 04:08:52.760 align:start position:0%
it was brought it was pointed out the
 
04:08:55.429 --> 04:08:55.439 align:start position:0%
only requirement is that the location of
 
04:08:58.670 --> 04:08:58.680 align:start position:0%
where that body is buried uh is listed
 
04:09:01.070 --> 04:09:01.080 align:start position:0%
the GPS coordinates are filed with the
 
04:09:03.109 --> 04:09:03.119 align:start position:0%
registry of deeds so it is on the
 
04:09:05.149 --> 04:09:05.159 align:start position:0%
document that someone is buried there
 
04:09:06.429 --> 04:09:06.439 align:start position:0%
you might see that you know there's old
 
04:09:09.670 --> 04:09:09.680 align:start position:0%
cemeteries all over the place um and
 
04:09:13.070 --> 04:09:13.080 align:start position:0%
then I'm just going to close up here um
 
04:09:15.229 --> 04:09:15.239 align:start position:0%
I just had a few more things I wanted to
 
04:09:19.070 --> 04:09:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:22.910 --> 04:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
uh I think I've about covered everything
 
04:09:25.950 --> 04:09:25.960 align:start position:0%
um but in conclusion I just want to just
 
04:09:26.990 --> 04:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
say that you know we have our
 
04:09:28.910 --> 04:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
neighboring states that have approved
 
04:09:30.349 --> 04:09:30.359 align:start position:0%
this and they're working on their
 
04:09:32.910 --> 04:09:32.920 align:start position:0%
regulations I would just urge the
 
04:09:35.710 --> 04:09:35.720 align:start position:0%
committee to maybe was just pause I
 
04:09:38.910 --> 04:09:38.920 align:start position:0%
would like to pause and see how they
 
04:09:41.790 --> 04:09:41.800 align:start position:0%
navigate how they navigate this process
 
04:09:43.349 --> 04:09:43.359 align:start position:0%
you know another year or two or whatever
 
04:09:45.630 --> 04:09:45.640 align:start position:0%
once they're up and running and see what
 
04:09:47.189 --> 04:09:47.199 align:start position:0%
I and I want to talk further with my
 
04:09:49.870 --> 04:09:49.880 align:start position:0%
colleague in New York state you know to
 
04:09:52.070 --> 04:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
see what what issues they've approached
 
04:09:54.189 --> 04:09:54.199 align:start position:0%
I I really like to error on the side of
 
04:09:57.109 --> 04:09:57.119 align:start position:0%
caution I'm a very careful person myself
 
04:09:59.030 --> 04:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
and I think even more so as a funeral
 
04:10:01.630 --> 04:10:01.640 align:start position:0%
director um you know and I just want to
 
04:10:03.830 --> 04:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
evaluate then we can re-evaluate this
 
04:10:05.229 --> 04:10:05.239 align:start position:0%
and then see if it's something that's
 
04:10:07.950 --> 04:10:07.960 align:start position:0%
going to be a good fit for um you know
 
04:10:10.269 --> 04:10:10.279 align:start position:0%
here in the granite state so I want to
 
04:10:11.309 --> 04:10:11.319 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time and
 
04:10:12.990 --> 04:10:13.000 align:start position:0%
consideration I went way over my
 
04:10:15.550 --> 04:10:15.560 align:start position:0%
requested time but I had a lot more uh
 
04:10:19.229 --> 04:10:19.239 align:start position:0%
here to cover and um I'm welcome Happy
 
04:10:21.510 --> 04:10:21.520 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions you might
 
04:10:24.269 --> 04:10:24.279 align:start position:0%
have okay thank
 
04:10:27.309 --> 04:10:27.319 align:start position:0%
you representative uh
 
04:10:30.469 --> 04:10:30.479 align:start position:0%
MTI thank you madam chair thank you for
 
04:10:34.790 --> 04:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question Mr Moren um I have a
 
04:10:36.630 --> 04:10:36.640 align:start position:0%
couple of questions but I'll start with
 
04:10:40.189 --> 04:10:40.199 align:start position:0%
the one with the EMB bombing and when
 
04:10:43.229 --> 04:10:43.239 align:start position:0%
the body is buried after who is
 
04:10:48.990 --> 04:10:49.000 align:start position:0%
responsible for testing the Le um soil
 
04:10:53.070 --> 04:10:53.080 align:start position:0%
around where the bodies of embomb emomed
 
04:10:56.070 --> 04:10:56.080 align:start position:0%
bodies are buried and if there are any
 
04:10:58.870 --> 04:10:58.880 align:start position:0%
leeching pardon me represent manui that
 
04:11:01.189 --> 04:11:01.199 align:start position:0%
really isn't relevant to this bill and
 
04:11:04.229 --> 04:11:04.239 align:start position:0%
we're already over time so if you could
 
04:11:06.349 --> 04:11:06.359 align:start position:0%
take that offline I'd appreciate
 
04:11:06.359 --> 04:11:08.710 align:start position:0%
take that offline I'd appreciate
it

04:11:08.710 --> 04:11:08.720 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:11:14.510 --> 04:11:14.520 align:start position:0%
okay my okay second question was if the
 
04:11:18.550 --> 04:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
neighboring states are doing don't we
 
04:11:20.790 --> 04:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
have the obligation to provide that kind
 
04:11:24.550 --> 04:11:24.560 align:start position:0%
of a alternative a choices to our
 
04:11:29.510 --> 04:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
residents now like you said people come
 
04:11:34.710 --> 04:11:34.720 align:start position:0%
home so to have that option at home
 
04:11:36.349 --> 04:11:36.359 align:start position:0%
rather than go
 
04:11:39.910 --> 04:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
outside so won't that be an option to
 
04:11:42.349 --> 04:11:42.359 align:start position:0%
look at consider
 
04:11:45.070 --> 04:11:45.080 align:start position:0%
this well to answer answer your second
 
04:11:48.469 --> 04:11:48.479 align:start position:0%
question um yes people do in general
 
04:11:51.910 --> 04:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
come home when they die um one of the
 
04:11:54.630 --> 04:11:54.640 align:start position:0%
advantages if we had it now as we say
 
04:11:56.870 --> 04:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
with alkaline hydrolysis it specifically
 
04:11:58.469 --> 04:11:58.479 align:start position:0%
states in the statute and I'm not sure
 
04:12:00.269 --> 04:12:00.279 align:start position:0%
how exactly that happened well actually
 
04:12:02.590 --> 04:12:02.600 align:start position:0%
I do and I won't get into that is that
 
04:12:04.109 --> 04:12:04.119 align:start position:0%
even though it's prohibited here in New
 
04:12:06.870 --> 04:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we still allow for that
 
04:12:09.389 --> 04:12:09.399 align:start position:0%
individ ual's body to be shipped to
 
04:12:11.550 --> 04:12:11.560 align:start position:0%
Maine where there is an alkaline
 
04:12:14.469 --> 04:12:14.479 align:start position:0%
hydrolysis facility the process can be
 
04:12:18.189 --> 04:12:18.199 align:start position:0%
done and their little container of
 
04:12:21.429 --> 04:12:21.439 align:start position:0%
basically their bone residue is returned
 
04:12:25.030 --> 04:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
to the family so um and I think the same
 
04:12:26.830 --> 04:12:26.840 align:start position:0%
thing would be with the natural organic
 
04:12:29.070 --> 04:12:29.080 align:start position:0%
sorry trying to a couple different
 
04:12:30.510 --> 04:12:30.520 align:start position:0%
places but with natural organic
 
04:12:32.429 --> 04:12:32.439 align:start position:0%
reduction or human composting if they
 
04:12:34.670 --> 04:12:34.680 align:start position:0%
was allowed in Vermont and that it would
 
04:12:36.950 --> 04:12:36.960 align:start position:0%
just be a matter of transporting uh the
 
04:12:41.590 --> 04:12:41.600 align:start position:0%
body to that facility and uh and to uh
 
04:12:44.349 --> 04:12:44.359 align:start position:0%
and then it the the the remains would be
 
04:12:46.229 --> 04:12:46.239 align:start position:0%
returned to the family however that's
 
04:12:48.950 --> 04:12:48.960 align:start position:0%
done but I think um
 
04:12:52.189 --> 04:12:52.199 align:start position:0%
yeah I would I would personally prefer
 
04:12:54.269 --> 04:12:54.279 align:start position:0%
having done this for a while I would
 
04:12:56.389 --> 04:12:56.399 align:start position:0%
prefer to kind of sort out whatever
 
04:12:58.349 --> 04:12:58.359 align:start position:0%
questions and issues we think we might
 
04:13:01.550 --> 04:13:01.560 align:start position:0%
have before we make it statute make it
 
04:13:03.830 --> 04:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
law because once we do it's a lot harder
 
04:13:05.550 --> 04:13:05.560 align:start position:0%
to come back here and ask you folks to
 
04:13:07.950 --> 04:13:07.960 align:start position:0%
change things uh just don't want us to
 
04:13:09.429 --> 04:13:09.439 align:start position:0%
get into something that we'll regret a
 
04:13:11.870 --> 04:13:11.880 align:start position:0%
little later uh and I may be totally
 
04:13:14.349 --> 04:13:14.359 align:start position:0%
wrong I may be totally wrong I'm just I
 
04:13:16.469 --> 04:13:16.479 align:start position:0%
always air on the side of caution so I
 
04:13:21.309 --> 04:13:21.319 align:start position:0%
will yield Madam chair thank you else
 
04:13:21.319 --> 04:13:22.469 align:start position:0%
will yield Madam chair thank you else
reprentative

04:13:22.469 --> 04:13:22.479 align:start position:0%
reprentative
 
04:13:25.030 --> 04:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
Brown thank you madam chair I tried to
 
04:13:27.870 --> 04:13:27.880 align:start position:0%
write down uh all of your concerns as
 
04:13:29.469 --> 04:13:29.479 align:start position:0%
you were going through them he did
 
04:13:31.269 --> 04:13:31.279 align:start position:0%
provide written
 
04:13:35.189 --> 04:13:35.199 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you um it seems like a
 
04:13:37.149 --> 04:13:37.159 align:start position:0%
number of those could be fairly easy
 
04:13:39.910 --> 04:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
easily handled in Ru making so if you
 
04:13:42.790 --> 04:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
take out chain of custody which is is
 
04:13:45.269 --> 04:13:45.279 align:start position:0%
handled through in cremation in rules
 
04:13:48.750 --> 04:13:48.760 align:start position:0%
right and whether or not you call it no
 
04:13:50.670 --> 04:13:50.680 align:start position:0%
you call it something different those
 
04:13:53.269 --> 04:13:53.279 align:start position:0%
aren't huge hurdles in my
 
04:13:57.710 --> 04:13:57.720 align:start position:0%
estimation if you take those maybe less
 
04:14:01.070 --> 04:14:01.080 align:start position:0%
drastic pieces out what's the the the
 
04:14:03.790 --> 04:14:03.800 align:start position:0%
biggest concern that you have about this
 
04:14:06.429 --> 04:14:06.439 align:start position:0%
if if that makes any sense the question
 
04:14:08.550 --> 04:14:08.560 align:start position:0%
you elicit a number that I think aren't
 
04:14:10.830 --> 04:14:10.840 align:start position:0%
maybe as critical as
 
04:14:14.309 --> 04:14:14.319 align:start position:0%
others no uh thank you representative um
 
04:14:15.910 --> 04:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
well obviously there there is a
 
04:14:17.550 --> 04:14:17.560 align:start position:0%
difference there's a variation in how
 
04:14:22.349 --> 04:14:22.359 align:start position:0%
critical our concerns are um it's it's a
 
04:14:25.309 --> 04:14:25.319 align:start position:0%
general I guess our con main concern is
 
04:14:27.510 --> 04:14:27.520 align:start position:0%
that we don't know I think there's more
 
04:14:29.870 --> 04:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
about this process than we really know
 
04:14:34.309 --> 04:14:34.319 align:start position:0%
it's all Rel it's all very new um and uh
 
04:14:35.790 --> 04:14:35.800 align:start position:0%
you know if we have other neighboring
 
04:14:38.030 --> 04:14:38.040 align:start position:0%
states doing this so that we can get
 
04:14:39.910 --> 04:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
real information about the issues that
 
04:14:42.309 --> 04:14:42.319 align:start position:0%
they're finding we can hopefully avoid
 
04:14:45.109 --> 04:14:45.119 align:start position:0%
those issues and then and I also believe
 
04:14:46.550 --> 04:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
if if we're going to if we're going to
 
04:14:48.950 --> 04:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
permit human composting we should go
 
04:14:50.990 --> 04:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
back and lift the prohibition on
 
04:14:53.590 --> 04:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
alkaline hydrolysis I mean there no
 
04:14:55.030 --> 04:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
one's going to agree with everything
 
04:14:57.950 --> 04:14:57.960 align:start position:0%
believe me and and I understand that and
 
04:15:00.469 --> 04:15:00.479 align:start position:0%
I appreciate that I do I so I try to
 
04:15:02.030 --> 04:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
keep my own feelings out of this
 
04:15:03.750 --> 04:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
entirely uh you know I'm a great
 
04:15:05.269 --> 04:15:05.279 align:start position:0%
believer as everyone says you know about
 
04:15:06.710 --> 04:15:06.720 align:start position:0%
offering the people of New Hampshire
 
04:15:06.720 --> 04:15:08.030 align:start position:0%
offering the people of New Hampshire
choice

04:15:08.030 --> 04:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
choice
 
04:15:10.870 --> 04:15:10.880 align:start position:0%
and I think we can do that in in several
 
04:15:13.349 --> 04:15:13.359 align:start position:0%
ways like I said what I explained to the
 
04:15:15.750 --> 04:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
representative here is that you know we
 
04:15:17.269 --> 04:15:17.279 align:start position:0%
have neighboring states and once this
 
04:15:19.030 --> 04:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
process is online then we can see how it
 
04:15:21.469 --> 04:15:21.479 align:start position:0%
works and and then if we want to adopt
 
04:15:24.109 --> 04:15:24.119 align:start position:0%
it i' I'd be up here advocating for it
 
04:15:27.710 --> 04:15:27.720 align:start position:0%
yeah absolutely thank thank
 
04:15:29.910 --> 04:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
you all right thank you very much for
 
04:15:32.429 --> 04:15:32.439 align:start position:0%
your testimony thank you madam
 
04:15:35.990 --> 04:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:36.000 --> 04:15:56.030 align:start position:0%
 
Clark

04:15:56.030 --> 04:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:58.910 --> 04:15:58.920 align:start position:0%
so I'm oh I'm passing around my
 
04:16:01.870 --> 04:16:01.880 align:start position:0%
testimonial and a green burial flyer for
 
04:16:03.790 --> 04:16:03.800 align:start position:0%
you to look at and I'll read a shortened
 
04:16:06.750 --> 04:16:06.760 align:start position:0%
version of what I'm passing out to you
 
04:16:09.309 --> 04:16:09.319 align:start position:0%
um um my name is Sarah Clark I live in
 
04:16:11.309 --> 04:16:11.319 align:start position:0%
New Market New Hampshire and I'm a
 
04:16:13.469 --> 04:16:13.479 align:start position:0%
caregiver in death Dua working to create
 
04:16:16.469 --> 04:16:16.479 align:start position:0%
a green burial cemetery and I'm in
 
04:16:18.710 --> 04:16:18.720 align:start position:0%
support of House Bill 1324 and I'll tell
 
04:16:21.910 --> 04:16:21.920 align:start position:0%
you why through my death duel training I
 
04:16:23.830 --> 04:16:23.840 align:start position:0%
learned how to provide holistic support
 
04:16:25.550 --> 04:16:25.560 align:start position:0%
for those in the intense transition of
 
04:16:27.510 --> 04:16:27.520 align:start position:0%
dying something I had already been doing
 
04:16:30.269 --> 04:16:30.279 align:start position:0%
in my personal life for years I also
 
04:16:32.030 --> 04:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
learned about the environmental issues
 
04:16:34.269 --> 04:16:34.279 align:start position:0%
with cremation and immediately resonated
 
04:16:36.950 --> 04:16:36.960 align:start position:0%
with the idea of a green burial and I
 
04:16:38.830 --> 04:16:38.840 align:start position:0%
hope to start a green burial Cemetery
 
04:16:42.030 --> 04:16:42.040 align:start position:0%
sometime in my life then last summer a
 
04:16:43.990 --> 04:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
friend who works as a funeral director
 
04:16:45.910 --> 04:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
in the Sea Coast shared that she
 
04:16:48.269 --> 04:16:48.279 align:start position:0%
receives many requests for alternative
 
04:16:51.030 --> 04:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
interment options and is disappointed
 
04:16:52.830 --> 04:16:52.840 align:start position:0%
she has so little to offer to meet the
 
04:16:55.510 --> 04:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
wishes of these families since that
 
04:16:57.590 --> 04:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
fateful conversation an idea was born
 
04:16:59.389 --> 04:16:59.399 align:start position:0%
and she and I and numerous others have
 
04:17:01.109 --> 04:17:01.119 align:start position:0%
been working hard to create a green
 
04:17:03.750 --> 04:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
Barrel Cemetery in the Sea Coast what
 
04:17:05.950 --> 04:17:05.960 align:start position:0%
started as an exploratory idea has been
 
04:17:07.990 --> 04:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
solidified into to an incorporated
 
04:17:10.269 --> 04:17:10.279 align:start position:0%
nonprofit propelled by an astounding
 
04:17:12.510 --> 04:17:12.520 align:start position:0%
amount of interest and support seemingly
 
04:17:15.750 --> 04:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
everywhere we turn we have few two
 
04:17:19.229 --> 04:17:19.239 align:start position:0%
funeral homes that are um committed to
 
04:17:21.870 --> 04:17:21.880 align:start position:0%
partnering with us based on how much
 
04:17:24.750 --> 04:17:24.760 align:start position:0%
interest they get from their clients and
 
04:17:26.910 --> 04:17:26.920 align:start position:0%
we're also in talks with land trusts to
 
04:17:28.469 --> 04:17:28.479 align:start position:0%
find the right piece of conservation
 
04:17:31.389 --> 04:17:31.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:35.349 --> 04:17:35.359 align:start position:0%
cemetery I have extras of
 
04:17:39.149 --> 04:17:39.159 align:start position:0%
those um and and yeah we aim to fit
 
04:17:41.870 --> 04:17:41.880 align:start position:0%
collaboratively into the existing death
 
04:17:44.510 --> 04:17:44.520 align:start position:0%
care framework in our area you can see
 
04:17:47.229 --> 04:17:47.239 align:start position:0%
more about the project on our website
 
04:17:48.990 --> 04:17:49.000 align:start position:0%
through my green burial Cemetery efforts
 
04:17:50.429 --> 04:17:50.439 align:start position:0%
I was introduced to representative
 
04:17:52.349 --> 04:17:52.359 align:start position:0%
lamantine and learned of her work to
 
04:17:54.389 --> 04:17:54.399 align:start position:0%
further Define green burial terms in our
 
04:17:56.750 --> 04:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
state statutes I'm so pleased to
 
04:17:58.349 --> 04:17:58.359 align:start position:0%
lawmaker is paying attention to this
 
04:18:00.309 --> 04:18:00.319 align:start position:0%
rapidly growing movement and seeks to
 
04:18:01.990 --> 04:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
expand it even further with natural
 
04:18:04.349 --> 04:18:04.359 align:start position:0%
organic reduction although I'm not
 
04:18:06.750 --> 04:18:06.760 align:start position:0%
looking to open a nor facility I'm in
 
04:18:08.790 --> 04:18:08.800 align:start position:0%
rep of anything that further clarifies
 
04:18:10.790 --> 04:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
the legality around these alternative
 
04:18:13.189 --> 04:18:13.199 align:start position:0%
death care options and I would be
 
04:18:15.070 --> 04:18:15.080 align:start position:0%
delighted to collaborate with any future
 
04:18:17.429 --> 04:18:17.439 align:start position:0%
North facilities and potentially receive
 
04:18:19.990 --> 04:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
their excess soil to use to further
 
04:18:22.790 --> 04:18:22.800 align:start position:0%
conservation efforts on the cemetery
 
04:18:25.389 --> 04:18:25.399 align:start position:0%
property I'm here today to support these
 
04:18:27.229 --> 04:18:27.239 align:start position:0%
initiatives because of their gentler
 
04:18:29.710 --> 04:18:29.720 align:start position:0%
environmental impact and because they
 
04:18:31.510 --> 04:18:31.520 align:start position:0%
reflect the desires of the many
 
04:18:33.710 --> 04:18:33.720 align:start position:0%
environmentally conscious individuals in
 
04:18:35.710 --> 04:18:35.720 align:start position:0%
our community who are asking for more
 
04:18:35.720 --> 04:18:37.590 align:start position:0%
our community who are asking for more
options

04:18:37.590 --> 04:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
options
 
04:18:39.510 --> 04:18:39.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for your attention any
 
04:18:42.670 --> 04:18:42.680 align:start position:0%
questions other questions representative
 
04:18:45.189 --> 04:18:45.199 align:start position:0%
Andi thank you madam chair a quick
 
04:18:47.990 --> 04:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
question are you aware of any other
 
04:18:50.950 --> 04:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
cultures anywhere else in the world that
 
04:18:55.030 --> 04:18:55.040 align:start position:0%
is using this process
 
04:18:55.040 --> 04:18:57.710 align:start position:0%
is using this process
of

04:18:57.710 --> 04:18:57.720 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:18:59.630 --> 04:18:59.640 align:start position:0%
death good
 
04:18:59.640 --> 04:19:01.309 align:start position:0%
death good
question

04:19:01.309 --> 04:19:01.319 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:19:05.469 --> 04:19:05.479 align:start position:0%
um so not not fully I know there's a lot
 
04:19:08.349 --> 04:19:08.359 align:start position:0%
more flexibility Europe around these
 
04:19:11.830 --> 04:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
practices um and that's less of a hurdle
 
04:19:14.670 --> 04:19:14.680 align:start position:0%
and I know that indigenous cultures
 
04:19:18.910 --> 04:19:18.920 align:start position:0%
really support this type of practice um
 
04:19:20.630 --> 04:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
but I haven't done a full Deep dive into
 
04:19:22.830 --> 04:19:22.840 align:start position:0%
the other cultures it's a great idea
 
04:19:22.840 --> 04:19:23.590 align:start position:0%
the other cultures it's a great idea
thank

04:19:23.590 --> 04:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:19:26.189 --> 04:19:26.199 align:start position:0%
you I don't see any other questions so
 
04:19:28.790 --> 04:19:28.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
04:19:28.800 --> 04:19:35.630 align:start position:0%

Dunn

04:19:43.790 --> 04:19:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:45.630 --> 04:19:45.640 align:start position:0%
afterno turn your mic on please there
 
04:19:47.469 --> 04:19:47.479 align:start position:0%
you go good afternoon Madam chair and
 
04:19:49.269 --> 04:19:49.279 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I'm Bob Dunn
 
04:19:51.109 --> 04:19:51.119 align:start position:0%
the director of public policy for the
 
04:19:53.950 --> 04:19:53.960 align:start position:0%
Roman Catholic dasis of Manchester and
 
04:19:55.870 --> 04:19:55.880 align:start position:0%
I'm here today on behalf of Bishop Peter
 
04:19:58.830 --> 04:19:58.840 align:start position:0%
labashi to respectfully register our
 
04:20:01.349 --> 04:20:01.359 align:start position:0%
opposition to House Bill
 
04:20:03.630 --> 04:20:03.640 align:start position:0%
1324 and I should say right at the
 
04:20:05.870 --> 04:20:05.880 align:start position:0%
outset obviously the Catholic church has
 
04:20:08.309 --> 04:20:08.319 align:start position:0%
teachings on the disposal of human
 
04:20:11.750 --> 04:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
remains and I am not here to suggest
 
04:20:14.349 --> 04:20:14.359 align:start position:0%
that you should act in any particular
 
04:20:16.990 --> 04:20:17.000 align:start position:0%
way because that's what the Catholic
 
04:20:20.950 --> 04:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
Church teaches all I would like to do is
 
04:20:25.870 --> 04:20:25.880 align:start position:0%
to uh ask you to consider the principle
 
04:20:28.070 --> 04:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
that is at the heart not just of
 
04:20:29.790 --> 04:20:29.800 align:start position:0%
Catholic teaching but it's at the heart
 
04:20:33.030 --> 04:20:33.040 align:start position:0%
of the secular body politic as well and
 
04:20:35.550 --> 04:20:35.560 align:start position:0%
that is the principle of the inherent
 
04:20:37.790 --> 04:20:37.800 align:start position:0%
Dignity of each human
 
04:20:40.550 --> 04:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
being as you look at the various laws
 
04:20:43.870 --> 04:20:43.880 align:start position:0%
and rules that deal with the disposal of
 
04:20:47.349 --> 04:20:47.359 align:start position:0%
human remains it's pretty obvious that
 
04:20:50.149 --> 04:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
they're uh proceeding from the starting
 
04:20:52.469 --> 04:20:52.479 align:start position:0%
point that those remains are entitled to
 
04:20:56.189 --> 04:20:56.199 align:start position:0%
be treated with respect and that's
 
04:20:58.710 --> 04:20:58.720 align:start position:0%
clearly a consequence of the dignity
 
04:21:01.870 --> 04:21:01.880 align:start position:0%
that that human being possessed in life
 
04:21:04.469 --> 04:21:04.479 align:start position:0%
and it also serves as a reminder of and
 
04:21:06.950 --> 04:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
a reinforcement for
 
04:21:09.550 --> 04:21:09.560 align:start position:0%
the dignity that human beings possess
 
04:21:12.630 --> 04:21:12.640 align:start position:0%
and so the way that we treat uh human
 
04:21:17.389 --> 04:21:17.399 align:start position:0%
bodies is to some degree uh it an it it
 
04:21:19.710 --> 04:21:19.720 align:start position:0%
has an impact on the way that we treat
 
04:21:23.469 --> 04:21:23.479 align:start position:0%
living people as well and that's why we
 
04:21:26.269 --> 04:21:26.279 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill because in our view
 
04:21:29.950 --> 04:21:29.960 align:start position:0%
natural uh natural organic reduction of
 
04:21:33.510 --> 04:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
remains uh is a process process that
 
04:21:36.590 --> 04:21:36.600 align:start position:0%
simply isn't consistent with human
 
04:21:39.750 --> 04:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
dignity especially in so far as it's
 
04:21:43.229 --> 04:21:43.239 align:start position:0%
tied to human composting because to
 
04:21:47.830 --> 04:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
treat the human uh body in a utilitarian
 
04:21:51.710 --> 04:21:51.720 align:start position:0%
way um is something that reinforces the
 
04:21:54.790 --> 04:21:54.800 align:start position:0%
principle that H living humans can be
 
04:21:58.750 --> 04:21:58.760 align:start position:0%
treated in a utilitarian way in our view
 
04:22:00.990 --> 04:22:01.000 align:start position:0%
uh now I recognize there are going to be
 
04:22:03.469 --> 04:22:03.479 align:start position:0%
differences of opinion on what is
 
04:22:05.389 --> 04:22:05.399 align:start position:0%
consistent with human dignity but I
 
04:22:07.109 --> 04:22:07.119 align:start position:0%
simply ask that
 
04:22:10.109 --> 04:22:10.119 align:start position:0%
uh in all of the the the discussions
 
04:22:11.910 --> 04:22:11.920 align:start position:0%
that you're having on this and we've
 
04:22:15.149 --> 04:22:15.159 align:start position:0%
heard a lot of technical things today
 
04:22:18.510 --> 04:22:18.520 align:start position:0%
that um as you deliberate you uh answer
 
04:22:20.990 --> 04:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
for yourselves in your own minds first
 
04:22:23.870 --> 04:22:23.880 align:start position:0%
of all the question of whether this
 
04:22:26.670 --> 04:22:26.680 align:start position:0%
process comports with human dignity
 
04:22:29.309 --> 04:22:29.319 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you any
 
04:22:32.510 --> 04:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
questions for Mr dun representative
 
04:22:37.030 --> 04:22:37.040 align:start position:0%
Schmid thank you madam chair uh
 
04:22:39.990 --> 04:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
so I I'm I'm
 
04:22:42.469 --> 04:22:42.479 align:start position:0%
wondering it seems like there's a kind
 
04:22:45.429 --> 04:22:45.439 align:start position:0%
of a value judgment with regard
 
04:22:51.990 --> 04:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:56.109 --> 04:22:56.119 align:start position:0%
um composting com that's I was trying to
 
04:22:58.550 --> 04:22:58.560 align:start position:0%
remember exactly the word the composting
 
04:23:02.790 --> 04:23:02.800 align:start position:0%
example but when representative ltin was
 
04:23:04.870 --> 04:23:04.880 align:start position:0%
testifying she talked about the fact
 
04:23:10.349 --> 04:23:10.359 align:start position:0%
that once the a certain status is is
 
04:23:13.510 --> 04:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
reached or state is reached there is no
 
04:23:16.670 --> 04:23:16.680 align:start position:0%
more DNA there's it's not it's not human
 
04:23:19.349 --> 04:23:19.359 align:start position:0%
remains anymore it's just
 
04:23:21.750 --> 04:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
stuff she didn't use that word but I'm
 
04:23:24.429 --> 04:23:24.439 align:start position:0%
using it if there's no
 
04:23:28.990 --> 04:23:29.000 align:start position:0%
human no DNA there's nothing left of the
 
04:23:32.670 --> 04:23:32.680 align:start position:0%
human body right it's just stuff right
 
04:23:34.910 --> 04:23:34.920 align:start position:0%
well I'd answer that I guess uh by
 
04:23:37.990 --> 04:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
saying two things first first of all um
 
04:23:41.469 --> 04:23:41.479 align:start position:0%
I would that was a human body okay so
 
04:23:44.189 --> 04:23:44.199 align:start position:0%
it's it's something that I think is
 
04:23:47.990 --> 04:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
inescapably still human remains and if
 
04:23:50.149 --> 04:23:50.159 align:start position:0%
it's not human remains scientifically it
 
04:23:53.309 --> 04:23:53.319 align:start position:0%
certainly is I think existentially or
 
04:23:57.149 --> 04:23:57.159 align:start position:0%
philosophically but secondly um Mr Moren
 
04:24:00.630 --> 04:24:00.640 align:start position:0%
testified uh that there are still uh
 
04:24:03.830 --> 04:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
there is still DNA that's uh associated
 
04:24:04.910 --> 04:24:04.920 align:start position:0%
with the
 
04:24:09.469 --> 04:24:09.479 align:start position:0%
bones that are in the uh soil as they're
 
04:24:13.710 --> 04:24:13.720 align:start position:0%
calling it um so uh I I guess I would
 
04:24:16.710 --> 04:24:16.720 align:start position:0%
just simply respectfully disagree that
 
04:24:20.309 --> 04:24:20.319 align:start position:0%
this is something that is separated from
 
04:24:23.710 --> 04:24:23.720 align:start position:0%
that human being that existed
 
04:24:27.550 --> 04:24:27.560 align:start position:0%
previously okay thank you thank
 
04:24:30.349 --> 04:24:30.359 align:start position:0%
you thanks very
 
04:24:32.469 --> 04:24:32.479 align:start position:0%
much m b
 
04:24:35.590 --> 04:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
yet representative Brown sorry I do have
 
04:24:36.710 --> 04:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
a question
 
04:24:39.389 --> 04:24:39.399 align:start position:0%
a question sorry I I thought you saw me
 
04:24:42.950 --> 04:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:45.710 --> 04:24:45.720 align:start position:0%
apologies uh thank you for being here
 
04:24:50.710 --> 04:24:50.720 align:start position:0%
refreshing change of outlook on this
 
04:24:54.750 --> 04:24:54.760 align:start position:0%
um a person that's buried in a pine box
 
04:24:58.910 --> 04:24:58.920 align:start position:0%
or a or some other easily decomposable
 
04:25:01.870 --> 04:25:01.880 align:start position:0%
container that isn't
 
04:25:05.070 --> 04:25:05.080 align:start position:0%
involed sort of ends up in the same
 
04:25:05.080 --> 04:25:07.630 align:start position:0%
involed sort of ends up in the same
condition

04:25:07.630 --> 04:25:07.640 align:start position:0%
condition
 
04:25:11.030 --> 04:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
and do you find a difference in that So
 
04:25:12.870 --> 04:25:12.880 align:start position:0%
eventually this body that's buried in
 
04:25:15.510 --> 04:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
the soil decomposes and becomes part of
 
04:25:17.710 --> 04:25:17.720 align:start position:0%
the soil or it doesn't get
 
04:25:17.720 --> 04:25:20.429 align:start position:0%
the soil or it doesn't get
moved

04:25:20.429 --> 04:25:20.439 align:start position:0%
moved
 
04:25:22.630 --> 04:25:22.640 align:start position:0%
and forgive me for asking this way do
 
04:25:24.070 --> 04:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
you have a problem with that let me see
 
04:25:25.149 --> 04:25:25.159 align:start position:0%
if I could be
 
04:25:28.309 --> 04:25:28.319 align:start position:0%
simple uh do I have a problem with so
 
04:25:29.990 --> 04:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
there's a is there you see a difference
 
04:25:32.070 --> 04:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
there between human composting I guess
 
04:25:34.670 --> 04:25:34.680 align:start position:0%
you're taking the soil elsewhere or just
 
04:25:36.389 --> 04:25:36.399 align:start position:0%
human composting that happens in the
 
04:25:39.550 --> 04:25:39.560 align:start position:0%
ground on its own well the I think the
 
04:25:41.670 --> 04:25:41.680 align:start position:0%
the body that's buried in a traditional
 
04:25:45.870 --> 04:25:45.880 align:start position:0%
way is not being composted right it's
 
04:25:48.790 --> 04:25:48.800 align:start position:0%
not being used for the purpose of of
 
04:25:52.229 --> 04:25:52.239 align:start position:0%
growing other things it it is a given
 
04:25:57.349 --> 04:25:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:59.910 --> 04:25:59.920 align:start position:0%
place thank
 
04:26:04.309 --> 04:26:04.319 align:start position:0%
you Mel Bennett and Jessica
 
04:26:19.389 --> 04:26:19.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:22.550 --> 04:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
confusion good afternoon I'm Jessica
 
04:26:25.870 --> 04:26:25.880 align:start position:0%

04:26:31.790 --> 04:26:31.800 align:start position:0%

Forest is a nonprofit conservation
 
04:26:42.510 --> 04:26:42.520 align:start position:0%
Cemetery as I said located in Hillsboro
 
04:26:44.950 --> 04:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
we provide plots and Memorial trees for
 
04:26:47.429 --> 04:26:47.439 align:start position:0%
the burial of cremated remains only at
 
04:26:50.429 --> 04:26:50.439 align:start position:0%
this time life forest was founded on the
 
04:26:52.710 --> 04:26:52.720 align:start position:0%
need for alternative burial and Memorial
 
04:26:55.070 --> 04:26:55.080 align:start position:0%
options so we are always in support of
 
04:26:57.790 --> 04:26:57.800 align:start position:0%
new disposition methods for families to
 
04:26:59.990 --> 04:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
memorialize their loved
 
04:27:02.630 --> 04:27:02.640 align:start position:0%
ones it has been life forest's hope and
 
04:27:04.309 --> 04:27:04.319 align:start position:0%
vision that we would eventually have the
 
04:27:07.030 --> 04:27:07.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity to provide very options for
 
04:27:09.109 --> 04:27:09.119 align:start position:0%
those choosing the process of natural
 
04:27:12.109 --> 04:27:12.119 align:start position:0%
organic reduction or nor so we are
 
04:27:14.109 --> 04:27:14.119 align:start position:0%
thrilled that a bill authorizing the
 
04:27:15.870 --> 04:27:15.880 align:start position:0%
natural organic reduction of human
 
04:27:17.389 --> 04:27:17.399 align:start position:0%

however after reading the bill carefully
 
04:27:24.149 --> 04:27:24.159 align:start position:0%
we are here to ask you to consider one
 
04:27:26.710 --> 04:27:26.720 align:start position:0%
important detail which hasn't
 
04:27:28.870 --> 04:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
significantly been addressed in the bill
 
04:27:31.189 --> 04:27:31.199 align:start position:0%
and that is the actual definition of the
 
04:27:34.469 --> 04:27:34.479 align:start position:0%
resulting material of the nor process is
 
04:27:37.710 --> 04:27:37.720 align:start position:0%
it human remains or or is it a product
 
04:27:40.670 --> 04:27:40.680 align:start position:0%
if it is a product is it actually soil a
 
04:27:43.950 --> 04:27:43.960 align:start position:0%

operating a cemetery in New Hampshire
 
04:30:34.389 --> 04:30:34.399 align:start position:0%
for about four years and went through
 
04:30:38.109 --> 04:30:38.119 align:start position:0%
the legisl all the process I have um
 
04:30:41.469 --> 04:30:41.479 align:start position:0%
done some very deep research with the

national level Environmental Protection
 
04:30:48.309 --> 04:30:48.319 align:start position:0%
Agency as well as the USDA I opened
 
04:30:51.469 --> 04:30:51.479 align:start position:0%
several inquisitive cases with both

04:31:03.710 --> 04:31:03.720 align:start position:0%
different people have different ways of
 
04:31:07.429 --> 04:31:07.439 align:start position:0%
healing their heart and we do get a lot
 
04:31:11.229 --> 04:31:11.239 align:start position:0%
of people who wish for this and I wish
 
04:31:13.109 --> 04:31:13.119 align:start position:0%
that anybody that wants to heal their
 
04:31:14.870 --> 04:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
heart in whatever way makes sense to
 
04:31:18.189 --> 04:31:18.199 align:start position:0%
them I want that to be available to
 
04:31:21.469 --> 04:31:21.479 align:start position:0%
them but when I made the calls to my
 
04:31:23.990 --> 04:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
contacts in my ommen at the Department
 
04:31:26.710 --> 04:31:26.720 align:start position:0%
of Environmental Services there were no
 
04:31:30.389 --> 04:31:30.399 align:start position:0%
clear answers because any amount of soil
 
04:31:33.030 --> 04:31:33.040 align:start position:0%
in which you take whether
 
04:31:33.040 --> 04:31:34.550 align:start position:0%
in which you take whether
permanent

04:31:34.550 --> 04:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
permanent
 
04:31:38.550 --> 04:31:38.560 align:start position:0%
or non-permanent placement on land
 
04:31:39.870 --> 04:31:39.880 align:start position:0%
requires a
 
04:31:43.030 --> 04:31:43.040 align:start position:0%
permit so when I asked how do I get a
 
04:31:46.030 --> 04:31:46.040 align:start position:0%
permit for no they said well what is it
 
04:31:48.550 --> 04:31:48.560 align:start position:0%
so we get you to the right department
 
04:31:51.309 --> 04:31:51.319 align:start position:0%
and I said it's soil and they said okay
 
04:31:53.990 --> 04:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
you need to go to the USDA and the USDA
 
04:31:55.349 --> 04:31:55.359 align:start position:0%
said well you
 
04:31:58.389 --> 04:31:58.399 align:start position:0%
need even for a small amount a handheld
 
04:32:00.429 --> 04:32:00.439 align:start position:0%
of soil that's going to go across States
 
04:32:01.990 --> 04:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
much like
 
04:32:04.630 --> 04:32:04.640 align:start position:0%
firewood local firewood cannot be
 
04:32:06.469 --> 04:32:06.479 align:start position:0%

04:32:09.790 --> 04:32:09.800 align:start position:0%
lines but firewood that has been
 
04:32:12.309 --> 04:32:12.319 align:start position:0%
approved sealed and recognized as a
 
04:32:15.229 --> 04:32:15.239 align:start position:0%
product can you can buy it at Home
 
04:32:17.309 --> 04:32:17.319 align:start position:0%
Depot but it's because it's been
 
04:32:19.710 --> 04:32:19.720 align:start position:0%
regulated in a safe
 
04:32:23.309 --> 04:32:23.319 align:start position:0%
way so my fear is that they're going to
 
04:32:26.550 --> 04:32:26.560 align:start position:0%
be asking Funeral Directors to become
 
04:32:29.710 --> 04:32:29.720 align:start position:0%
agricultural experts and then at the end
 
04:32:32.710 --> 04:32:32.720 align:start position:0%
if we don't have a legal definition of
 
04:32:33.590 --> 04:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
what it
 
04:32:36.349 --> 04:32:36.359 align:start position:0%
is there will be a a lot of
 
04:32:39.030 --> 04:32:39.040 align:start position:0%
responsibility placed on the end result
 
04:32:41.830 --> 04:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
on where it can go legally and we can't
 
04:32:43.510 --> 04:32:43.520 align:start position:0%
take it legally because we can't get a
 
04:32:46.309 --> 04:32:46.319 align:start position:0%
permit for it because the descriptions
 
04:32:47.510 --> 04:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
are not
 
04:32:50.269 --> 04:32:50.279 align:start position:0%
clear so this is our concerns do we have
 
04:32:53.030 --> 04:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
any but I I love the idea I love the
 
04:32:55.229 --> 04:32:55.239 align:start position:0%
idea that heals Hearts but I just
 
04:32:59.189 --> 04:32:59.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:02.510 --> 04:33:02.520 align:start position:0%
is thank you that's serious concern any
 
04:33:02.520 --> 04:33:03.789 align:start position:0%
is thank you that's serious concern any
other

04:33:03.789 --> 04:33:03.799 align:start position:0%
other
 
04:33:06.670 --> 04:33:06.680 align:start position:0%
questions all right thank you very much
 
04:33:06.680 --> 04:33:18.029 align:start position:0%
questions all right thank you very much
you're

04:33:18.029 --> 04:33:18.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:20.230 --> 04:33:20.240 align:start position:0%
welcome I take it that someone else who
 
04:33:25.709 --> 04:33:25.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:28.029 --> 04:33:28.039 align:start position:0%
testify thank you madam chair and thank
 
04:33:30.150 --> 04:33:30.160 align:start position:0%
you committee for taking my testimony I
 
04:33:31.310 --> 04:33:31.320 align:start position:0%
understand we're you're running behind
 
04:33:33.750 --> 04:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
so I apologize um my name is Alison nap
 
04:33:34.910 --> 04:33:34.920 align:start position:0%
I'm the state representative from
 
04:33:36.990 --> 04:33:37.000 align:start position:0%
Rockingham M2 stratum and one of the
 
04:33:39.029 --> 04:33:39.039 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors of this bill um I just
 
04:33:40.470 --> 04:33:40.480 align:start position:0%
wanted to address a couple of things
 
04:33:42.470 --> 04:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
that have been mentioned here today one
 
04:33:44.429 --> 04:33:44.439 align:start position:0%
is that in talking two companies that
 
04:33:45.750 --> 04:33:45.760 align:start position:0%
are already doing this across the
 
04:33:47.910 --> 04:33:47.920 align:start position:0%
country um many people choose this for
 
04:33:49.629 --> 04:33:49.639 align:start position:0%
environmental reasons so the idea that
 
04:33:51.789 --> 04:33:51.799 align:start position:0%
you would have it done in another state
 
04:33:53.349 --> 04:33:53.359 align:start position:0%
or have your body transferred to another
 
04:33:54.869 --> 04:33:54.879 align:start position:0%
state to have this done and transferred
 
04:33:57.310 --> 04:33:57.320 align:start position:0%
back sort of negates the effect of the
 
04:33:58.949 --> 04:33:58.959 align:start position:0%
environmental concerns that people are
 
04:34:01.949 --> 04:34:01.959 align:start position:0%
doing this for so um I respect the idea
 
04:34:03.109 --> 04:34:03.119 align:start position:0%
that you could do it in another state
 
04:34:04.510 --> 04:34:04.520 align:start position:0%
but I think many people would want this
 
04:34:07.269 --> 04:34:07.279 align:start position:0%
available in New Hampshire and and want
 
04:34:09.629 --> 04:34:09.639 align:start position:0%
the option here um I would also just
 
04:34:11.910 --> 04:34:11.920 align:start position:0%
remind people that this is enabling
 
04:34:13.869 --> 04:34:13.879 align:start position:0%
legislation it allows people another
 
04:34:15.910 --> 04:34:15.920 align:start position:0%
option and for many people this is
 
04:34:17.990 --> 04:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
something desire they desire when I talk
 
04:34:19.869 --> 04:34:19.879 align:start position:0%
to people about this bill having been a
 
04:34:22.029 --> 04:34:22.039 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor um so many people are really
 
04:34:23.830 --> 04:34:23.840 align:start position:0%
excited about the idea and it's a really
 
04:34:25.150 --> 04:34:25.160 align:start position:0%
I think it's a really important option
 
04:34:27.789 --> 04:34:27.799 align:start position:0%
for people to have in the state and
 
04:34:29.349 --> 04:34:29.359 align:start position:0%
lastly I will say that um we have
 
04:34:31.429 --> 04:34:31.439 align:start position:0%
reached out to Dees the solid waste
 
04:34:32.670 --> 04:34:32.680 align:start position:0%
division has said that they would not
 
04:34:34.830 --> 04:34:34.840 align:start position:0%
regulate compost derived from natural
 
04:34:37.990 --> 04:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
organic production so um there might be
 
04:34:39.510 --> 04:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
a question remaining on that that the
 
04:34:40.750 --> 04:34:40.760 align:start position:0%
committee would would need to
 
04:34:42.510 --> 04:34:42.520 align:start position:0%
investigate but it has not been our
 
04:34:43.629 --> 04:34:43.639 align:start position:0%
understanding that it is something that
 
04:34:46.189 --> 04:34:46.199 align:start position:0%
would have to be regulated in this way
 
04:34:49.510 --> 04:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
um and we also believe that that could
 
04:34:51.390 --> 04:34:51.400 align:start position:0%
be addressed in rul making the
 
04:34:53.949 --> 04:34:53.959 align:start position:0%
disposition well if the statute defines
 
04:34:56.990 --> 04:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
your product as soil which and looking
 
04:34:59.429 --> 04:34:59.439 align:start position:0%
at the bill that's what it does then it
 
04:35:02.910 --> 04:35:02.920 align:start position:0%
needs to fill be regulated as soil if
 
04:35:05.269 --> 04:35:05.279 align:start position:0%
you're going to declare it as compost
 
04:35:07.629 --> 04:35:07.639 align:start position:0%
and get a different set of regulations
 
04:35:10.629 --> 04:35:10.639 align:start position:0%
than we need to to work on the bill okay
 
04:35:13.230 --> 04:35:13.240 align:start position:0%
so so we're in agreement okay thank you
 
04:35:14.590 --> 04:35:14.600 align:start position:0%
all right um thank you very much for
 
04:35:16.150 --> 04:35:16.160 align:start position:0%

my
testimony

04:37:42.109 --> 04:37:42.119 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
04:37:45.070 --> 04:37:45.080 align:start position:0%
um for several years you might have
 
04:37:46.949 --> 04:37:46.959 align:start position:0%
remembered a gentleman by the name of Mr
 
04:37:49.869 --> 04:37:49.879 align:start position:0%
Burnham he lived on Route 13 in
 
04:37:53.150 --> 04:37:53.160 align:start position:0%
Dunbarton who made national headlines
 
04:37:56.189 --> 04:37:56.199 align:start position:0%
because he refused to recognize daylight
 
04:37:59.150 --> 04:37:59.160 align:start position:0%
savings time because he said the cows
 
04:38:01.789 --> 04:38:01.799 align:start position:0%
don't understand it my crops don't
 
04:38:04.310 --> 04:38:04.320 align:start position:0%
understand it and neither does my body I
 
04:38:05.709 --> 04:38:05.719 align:start position:0%
go by the
 
04:38:08.029 --> 04:38:08.039 align:start position:0%
on I know we've all
 
04:38:11.470 --> 04:38:11.480 align:start position:0%
experienced waking up that day after the
 
04:38:13.349 --> 04:38:13.359 align:start position:0%
clocks are
 
04:38:17.429 --> 04:38:17.439 align:start position:0%
changed um tired and exhausted and
 
04:38:18.429 --> 04:38:18.439 align:start position:0%
wondering how we're going to make it
 
04:38:19.830 --> 04:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
through the day and it usually takes us
 
04:38:21.949 --> 04:38:21.959 align:start position:0%
about a week to get
 
04:38:25.429 --> 04:38:25.439 align:start position:0%
adjusted as a mom getting our kids
 
04:38:28.349 --> 04:38:28.359 align:start position:0%
ready during that time is also very
 
04:38:29.670 --> 04:38:29.680 align:start position:0%
difficult because we have to wake them
 
04:38:31.990 --> 04:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
up an hour earlier than usual it's been
 
04:38:32.000 --> 04:38:33.029 align:start position:0%
up an hour earlier than usual it's been
very

04:38:33.029 --> 04:38:33.039 align:start position:0%
very
 
04:38:35.869 --> 04:38:35.879 align:start position:0%
difficult and as a high school teacher
 
04:38:39.670 --> 04:38:39.680 align:start position:0%
for 26 years I can tell you how much it
 
04:38:43.390 --> 04:38:43.400 align:start position:0%
is a detriment to students as a teacher
 
04:38:45.750 --> 04:38:45.760 align:start position:0%
of Juniors and seniors in high school
 
04:38:48.269 --> 04:38:48.279 align:start position:0%
who are tired they don't get enough
 
04:38:52.470 --> 04:38:52.480 align:start position:0%
sleep to begin with daylight savings
 
04:38:55.551 --> 04:38:55.561 align:start position:0%
time does hurt their performance in
 
04:38:57.990 --> 04:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
class and it usually again takes about a
 
04:38:59.590 --> 04:38:59.600 align:start position:0%
week two weeks to get
 
04:39:03.269 --> 04:39:03.279 align:start position:0%
adjusted I think the sun should be the
 
04:39:04.869 --> 04:39:04.879 align:start position:0%
guide for our bodies it's the natural
 
04:39:04.879 --> 04:39:07.510 align:start position:0%
guide for our bodies it's the natural
natural

04:39:07.510 --> 04:39:07.520 align:start position:0%
natural
 
04:39:10.470 --> 04:39:10.480 align:start position:0%
um the natural way that our bodies react
 
04:39:11.869 --> 04:39:11.879 align:start position:0%
I mean I don't know about you but I've
 
04:39:13.789 --> 04:39:13.799 align:start position:0%
never had to use an alarm clock because
 
04:39:17.070 --> 04:39:17.080 align:start position:0%
my body knows what time it is so I am in
 
04:39:20.230 --> 04:39:20.240 align:start position:0%
support of House Bill
 
04:39:22.910 --> 04:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
1075 and hope you are too thank you for
 
04:39:25.949 --> 04:39:25.959 align:start position:0%
taking my testimony thank you any
 
04:39:33.830 --> 04:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:33.840 --> 04:39:41.628 align:start position:0%
 
spaling

04:39:41.628 --> 04:39:41.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:42.830 --> 04:39:42.840 align:start position:0%
good afternoon members of the committee
 
04:39:44.110 --> 04:39:44.120 align:start position:0%
my name is Scott spradling I'm
 
04:39:45.670 --> 04:39:45.680 align:start position:0%
representing the New Hampshire

Association of
 
04:39:50.230 --> 04:39:50.240 align:start position:0%
broadcasters um this is a uh Repeat
 
04:39:51.830 --> 04:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
Performance of sorts I think we've had
 
04:39:53.990 --> 04:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
this conversation around this idea in
 
04:39:56.510 --> 04:39:56.520 align:start position:0%
multiple sessions before and let me make
 
04:39:59.190 --> 04:39:59.200 align:start position:0%
it very clear that um uh the the
 
04:40:01.270 --> 04:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
previous speaker's message absolutely
 
04:40:02.708 --> 04:40:02.718 align:start position:0%
resonates with the men and women who
 
04:40:04.430 --> 04:40:04.440 align:start position:0%
work in radio and television every
 
04:40:06.590 --> 04:40:06.600 align:start position:0%
single day and if it was a matter of our
 
04:40:08.868 --> 04:40:08.878 align:start position:0%
clock hours in our schedules being set
 
04:40:12.310 --> 04:40:12.320 align:start position:0%
by the Sun and by the cows we'd be in
 
04:40:14.150 --> 04:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
great shape but I think it's really
 
04:40:16.070 --> 04:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
important to understand the reason why
 
04:40:18.150 --> 04:40:18.160 align:start position:0%
we oppose this bill is because it will
 
04:40:21.030 --> 04:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
create some very serious uh financial
 
04:40:23.868 --> 04:40:23.878 align:start position:0%
and scheduling impacts on us radio and
 
04:40:26.430 --> 04:40:26.440 align:start position:0%
TV works in the clock business many of
 
04:40:29.190 --> 04:40:29.200 align:start position:0%
our members have radio stations that are
 
04:40:31.830 --> 04:40:31.840 align:start position:0%
in more than one state the way this bill
 
04:40:34.830 --> 04:40:34.840 align:start position:0%
and the follow-up Bill are structured it
 
04:40:36.990 --> 04:40:37.000 align:start position:0%
uh bifurcates all of New England and
 
04:40:38.670 --> 04:40:38.680 align:start position:0%
sets us apart from the rest of the
 
04:40:41.190 --> 04:40:41.200 align:start position:0%
region and creates some very real
 
04:40:43.350 --> 04:40:43.360 align:start position:0%
dramatic and absolutely measurable
 
04:40:46.230 --> 04:40:46.240 align:start position:0%
fiscal impacts Great Eastern radio
 
04:40:49.150 --> 04:40:49.160 align:start position:0%
operates along the Connecticut Valley uh
 
04:40:51.628 --> 04:40:51.638 align:start position:0%
in Claremont in Lebanon up and down the
 
04:40:53.628 --> 04:40:53.638 align:start position:0%
western part of our great state they
 
04:40:56.390 --> 04:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
also have stations in Vermont there was
 
04:40:58.750 --> 04:40:58.760 align:start position:0%
a great deal of simoc casting in New
 
04:41:01.310 --> 04:41:01.320 align:start position:0%
England radio stations and before anyone
 
04:41:04.270 --> 04:41:04.280 align:start position:0%
argues well we have already time zones
 
04:41:06.270 --> 04:41:06.280 align:start position:0%
around the country you are absolutely
 
04:41:08.030 --> 04:41:08.040 align:start position:0%
right and they were established before
 
04:41:10.590 --> 04:41:10.600 align:start position:0%
broadcast radio got started so our radio
 
04:41:13.670 --> 04:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
stations came together after we already
 
04:41:16.550 --> 04:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
had established time zones not before
 
04:41:18.750 --> 04:41:18.760 align:start position:0%
this type of an approach this type of a
 
04:41:20.750 --> 04:41:20.760 align:start position:0%
bill will do immediate damage to an
 
04:41:22.470 --> 04:41:22.480 align:start position:0%
industry that is already working very
 
04:41:24.390 --> 04:41:24.400 align:start position:0%
very hard as we watch technological
 
04:41:26.390 --> 04:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
changes happen around our country I
 
04:41:28.708 --> 04:41:28.718 align:start position:0%
would respectfully ask that you take a
 
04:41:30.230 --> 04:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
different approach to something like
 
04:41:32.310 --> 04:41:32.320 align:start position:0%
this it is admittedly the harder way to
 
04:41:34.110 --> 04:41:34.120 align:start position:0%
do it but I would hope that our the
 
04:41:36.708 --> 04:41:36.718 align:start position:0%
sponsor of this bill and the next bill
 
04:41:39.230 --> 04:41:39.240 align:start position:0%
who have keep offering this proposal
 
04:41:40.990 --> 04:41:41.000 align:start position:0%
would start collaborating with our
 
04:41:42.750 --> 04:41:42.760 align:start position:0%
federal delegation and have this
 
04:41:45.150 --> 04:41:45.160 align:start position:0%
conversation with a 50-state strategy
 
04:41:47.190 --> 04:41:47.200 align:start position:0%
and not pick a handful of states around
 
04:41:49.070 --> 04:41:49.080 align:start position:0%
us I think it's also important to note
 
04:41:50.230 --> 04:41:50.240 align:start position:0%
that at least one of the bills that
 
04:41:52.510 --> 04:41:52.520 align:start position:0%
you're hearing talks about linking to
 
04:41:55.470 --> 04:41:55.480 align:start position:0%
Maine and Massachusetts it is our
 
04:41:57.310 --> 04:41:57.320 align:start position:0%
understanding because the nhab has to
 
04:41:59.390 --> 04:41:59.400 align:start position:0%
track this with other broadcasters in
 
04:42:01.270 --> 04:42:01.280 align:start position:0%
other states that these conversations
 
04:42:02.910 --> 04:42:02.920 align:start position:0%
are not happening elsewhere so you're
 
04:42:05.270 --> 04:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
wasting your time so I would please ask
 
04:42:06.910 --> 04:42:06.920 align:start position:0%
that you respect the fact that a
 
04:42:09.510 --> 04:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
decision like this would have a very
 
04:42:11.750 --> 04:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
measurable negative effect on the
 
04:42:13.550 --> 04:42:13.560 align:start position:0%
broadcasters please don't mess with the
 
04:42:15.150 --> 04:42:15.160 align:start position:0%
clock radio let's go have this
 
04:42:16.990 --> 04:42:17.000 align:start position:0%
conversation in Washington where it
 
04:42:18.948 --> 04:42:18.958 align:start position:0%
belongs I'm happy to take
 
04:42:21.550 --> 04:42:21.560 align:start position:0%
questions thank you are there questions
 
04:42:23.708 --> 04:42:23.718 align:start position:0%
R Schmidt and the man
 
04:42:27.948 --> 04:42:27.958 align:start position:0%
py thank you very much Madam chair
 
04:42:31.030 --> 04:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
welcome Scott thank you representa so uh
 
04:42:33.110 --> 04:42:33.120 align:start position:0%
we've had bills in the past as you know
 
04:42:36.550 --> 04:42:36.560 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a an
 
04:42:40.550 --> 04:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
eternal Timeless shall we say Timeless
 
04:42:45.270 --> 04:42:45.280 align:start position:0%
subject um uh but but in the past some
 
04:42:47.030 --> 04:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
of the bills have Incorporated a
 
04:42:50.830 --> 04:42:50.840 align:start position:0%
provision which says we will we we
 
04:42:52.390 --> 04:42:52.400 align:start position:0%
really should be in a different time
 
04:42:55.310 --> 04:42:55.320 align:start position:0%
zone yes sir okay but we will not
 
04:42:57.510 --> 04:42:57.520 align:start position:0%
representative Schmid this one only says
 
04:43:00.110 --> 04:43:00.120 align:start position:0%
get rid of just get rid I understand bu
 
04:43:03.788 --> 04:43:03.798 align:start position:0%
I'm speaking to his point uh we would
 
04:43:06.948 --> 04:43:06.958 align:start position:0%
only change ours if they change theirs
 
04:43:09.590 --> 04:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
because New Hampshire is clearly linked
 
04:43:12.310 --> 04:43:12.320 align:start position:0%
extremely closely to Massachusetts and
 
04:43:15.230 --> 04:43:15.240 align:start position:0%
also to Maine but much more to
 
04:43:17.430 --> 04:43:17.440 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts we ain't going anywhere
 
04:43:20.708 --> 04:43:20.718 align:start position:0%
without Massachusetts moving there too
 
04:43:22.910 --> 04:43:22.920 align:start position:0%
so would the bill be any less
 
04:43:25.788 --> 04:43:25.798 align:start position:0%
objectionable if Massachusetts changed
 
04:43:28.150 --> 04:43:28.160 align:start position:0%
to a time zone that would be better as
 
04:43:30.910 --> 04:43:30.920 align:start position:0%
far as the son is concerned as the
 
04:43:33.110 --> 04:43:33.120 align:start position:0%
previous witness was testified sure and
 
04:43:34.150 --> 04:43:34.160 align:start position:0%
I certainly don't dispute what the
 
04:43:35.750 --> 04:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
previous witness said and the sort of
 
04:43:37.470 --> 04:43:37.480 align:start position:0%
the science behind the sunlight
 
04:43:39.550 --> 04:43:39.560 align:start position:0%
completely understand that but um it
 
04:43:41.430 --> 04:43:41.440 align:start position:0%
creates problems for our broadcasters
 
04:43:42.910 --> 04:43:42.920 align:start position:0%
because we have business relationships
 
04:43:44.470 --> 04:43:44.480 align:start position:0%
not just with Massachusetts and with
 
04:43:46.590 --> 04:43:46.600 align:start position:0%
Maine but also with Vermont and even
 
04:43:48.190 --> 04:43:48.200 align:start position:0%
Eastern New York so from the
 
04:43:49.750 --> 04:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
broadcaster's perspective it just
 
04:43:52.150 --> 04:43:52.160 align:start position:0%
creates real clock hour fiscal
 
04:43:54.788 --> 04:43:54.798 align:start position:0%
management problems because we can have
 
04:43:56.670 --> 04:43:56.680 align:start position:0%
if you change the hour schedule but you
 
04:43:59.750 --> 04:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
maintain your overall primary schedule
 
04:44:01.670 --> 04:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
that you have for radio stations you can
 
04:44:04.110 --> 04:44:04.120 align:start position:0%
have um real problems especially with
 
04:44:05.628 --> 04:44:05.638 align:start position:0%
night time broadcasting there are
 
04:44:07.670 --> 04:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
decency and indecency laws that start
 
04:44:09.990 --> 04:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
with 10 p.m. radio broadcast you can
 
04:44:12.070 --> 04:44:12.080 align:start position:0%
have as you can imagine if a couple of
 
04:44:13.910 --> 04:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
states in New England are at 9:00 and a
 
04:44:15.110 --> 04:44:15.120 align:start position:0%
couple of states of New England are at
 
04:44:17.190 --> 04:44:17.200 align:start position:0%
10:00 and you've got simoc casting
 
04:44:19.430 --> 04:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
you're creating some real programming
 
04:44:21.350 --> 04:44:21.360 align:start position:0%
challenges for local
 
04:44:24.830 --> 04:44:24.840 align:start position:0%
radio okay thank you very much thank you
 
04:44:26.470 --> 04:44:26.480 align:start position:0%
madam chair thank you for taking my
 
04:44:29.830 --> 04:44:29.840 align:start position:0%
question sure if the you totally abolish
 
04:44:32.310 --> 04:44:32.320 align:start position:0%
daylight saving time or across the
 
04:44:34.628 --> 04:44:34.638 align:start position:0%
country then you would be okay with no
 
04:44:37.310 --> 04:44:37.320 align:start position:0%
problem thank
 
04:44:39.390 --> 04:44:39.400 align:start position:0%
you all right thank you very much thank
 
04:45:00.430 --> 04:45:00.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:03.270 --> 04:45:03.280 align:start position:0%
tomier I
 
04:45:03.280 --> 04:45:14.270 align:start position:0%
tomier I
need

04:45:14.270 --> 04:45:14.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:17.788 --> 04:45:17.798 align:start position:0%
okay ladies and gentlemen uh Eastern
 
04:45:20.910 --> 04:45:20.920 align:start position:0%
Standard time is the mean solar time the
 
04:45:24.310 --> 04:45:24.320 align:start position:0%
75 degree Meridian west of the grenwich
 
04:45:27.310 --> 04:45:27.320 align:start position:0%
meridian daylight saving time is the
 
04:45:29.150 --> 04:45:29.160 align:start position:0%
same as Atlantic Standard time which is
 
04:45:32.670 --> 04:45:32.680 align:start position:0%
the mean solar time of the 60 degrees
 
04:45:34.948 --> 04:45:34.958 align:start position:0%
west of grenwich
 
04:45:36.948 --> 04:45:36.958 align:start position:0%
now what does it mean when you say mean
 
04:45:40.150 --> 04:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
solar time learn something new every day
 
04:45:43.788 --> 04:45:43.798 align:start position:0%
the Earth rotates in 23 hours 56 minutes
 
04:45:47.510 --> 04:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
and 4 seconds meanwhile she is moving on
 
04:45:50.510 --> 04:45:50.520 align:start position:0%
her orbit so when she goes to face the
 
04:45:52.868 --> 04:45:52.878 align:start position:0%
sun again the same hemisphere takes a
 
04:45:55.590 --> 04:45:55.600 align:start position:0%
few more minutes to face the Sun from a
 
04:45:57.510 --> 04:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
new position on her
 
04:46:00.310 --> 04:46:00.320 align:start position:0%
orbit the exact amount varies during the
 
04:46:03.110 --> 04:46:03.120 align:start position:0%
year because the orbit is not a circle
 
04:46:04.910 --> 04:46:04.920 align:start position:0%
it's an ellipse
 
04:46:06.470 --> 04:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
so sometimes it takes a little more than
 
04:46:09.070 --> 04:46:09.080 align:start position:0%
24 hours for the same hemisphere to face
 
04:46:11.430 --> 04:46:11.440 align:start position:0%
the sun again for the sun to Transit the
 
04:46:14.390 --> 04:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
meridian so sometimes a solar day is
 
04:46:16.788 --> 04:46:16.798 align:start position:0%
more than 24 hours sometimes it's a few
 
04:46:19.868 --> 04:46:19.878 align:start position:0%
seconds less and these add up uh during
 
04:46:23.150 --> 04:46:23.160 align:start position:0%
the months so the average day however is
 
04:46:26.990 --> 04:46:27.000 align:start position:0%
24 hours what do we mean by mean solar
 
04:46:29.868 --> 04:46:29.878 align:start position:0%
time well if the sun transits your
 
04:46:33.270 --> 04:46:33.280 align:start position:0%
Meridian on average 12 hours after your
 
04:46:35.948 --> 04:46:35.958 align:start position:0%
clock strikes midnight then your clock
 
04:46:39.310 --> 04:46:39.320 align:start position:0%
is on average solar time the average of
 
04:46:40.948 --> 04:46:40.958 align:start position:0%
12 hours after midnight that's when the
 
04:46:44.030 --> 04:46:44.040 align:start position:0%
sun should be crossing the Meridian on
 
04:46:45.948 --> 04:46:45.958 align:start position:0%
mean solar
 
04:46:49.830 --> 04:46:49.840 align:start position:0%
time as I said uh Atlantic time is the
 
04:46:54.030 --> 04:46:54.040 align:start position:0%
mean solar time for 60° West and Eastern
 
04:46:56.470 --> 04:46:56.480 align:start position:0%
Standard time is the mean solar time for
 
04:46:59.670 --> 04:46:59.680 align:start position:0%
75 degrees west and the Legislative
 
04:47:01.590 --> 04:47:01.600 align:start position:0%
Office B building in which we are
 
04:47:06.070 --> 04:47:06.080 align:start position:0%
sitting is 71.5 4 degrees west a lot
 
04:47:10.670 --> 04:47:10.680 align:start position:0%
closer to 75 than to 60 so it makes
 
04:47:14.190 --> 04:47:14.200 align:start position:0%
sense for New Hampshire to be in the
 
04:47:17.708 --> 04:47:17.718 align:start position:0%
Standard time zone and not the Atlantic
 
04:47:21.590 --> 04:47:21.600 align:start position:0%
time zone I want to debunk the myth here
 
04:47:24.430 --> 04:47:24.440 align:start position:0%
with these Maps the myth that New
 
04:47:26.070 --> 04:47:26.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire belongs in the Atlantic time
 
04:47:29.070 --> 04:47:29.080 align:start position:0%
zone you can see in the lower map there
 
04:47:31.750 --> 04:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
the the map of the time zone it kind of
 
04:47:33.548 --> 04:47:33.558 align:start position:0%
looks like G it's so far east maybe it
 
04:47:35.350 --> 04:47:35.360 align:start position:0%
belongs in the the Atlantic time zone
 
04:47:37.708 --> 04:47:37.718 align:start position:0%
but no uh it's because the western
 
04:47:40.270 --> 04:47:40.280 align:start position:0%
boundary is so far west that it just
 
04:47:42.190 --> 04:47:42.200 align:start position:0%
kind of creates that illusion in a lot
 
04:47:44.990 --> 04:47:45.000 align:start position:0%
of people's minds take a look at
 
04:47:48.788 --> 04:47:48.798 align:start position:0%
Michigan Northern Michigan is on the
 
04:47:50.948 --> 04:47:50.958 align:start position:0%
most of it is on Eastern
 
04:47:54.190 --> 04:47:54.200 align:start position:0%
time the boundary actually belongs 82
 
04:47:56.708 --> 04:47:56.718 align:start position:0%
and a half degrees west and most of
 
04:47:59.548 --> 04:47:59.558 align:start position:0%
Michigan belongs in central time so just
 
04:48:03.030 --> 04:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
as Maine would be split by a time zone
 
04:48:06.070 --> 04:48:06.080 align:start position:0%
line at 67 and a half Washington County
 
04:48:08.750 --> 04:48:08.760 align:start position:0%
Maine would be split and the line would
 
04:48:11.430 --> 04:48:11.440 align:start position:0%
go through Western New
 
04:48:14.150 --> 04:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
Brunswick most of New England almost all
 
04:48:16.948 --> 04:48:16.958 align:start position:0%
of New England belongs on Eastern time
 
04:48:19.708 --> 04:48:19.718 align:start position:0%
and why not just draw the line that so
 
04:48:22.510 --> 04:48:22.520 align:start position:0%
that all of Michigan would be in the
 
04:48:25.230 --> 04:48:25.240 align:start position:0%
central time zone people are led to
 
04:48:27.470 --> 04:48:27.480 align:start position:0%
think that New Hampshire is so far east
 
04:48:28.990 --> 04:48:29.000 align:start position:0%
that it belongs in Atlantic time because
 
04:48:31.830 --> 04:48:31.840 align:start position:0%
of the illusion because Michigan is
 
04:48:34.830 --> 04:48:34.840 align:start position:0%
mostly on Eastern Time so why don't they
 
04:48:37.070 --> 04:48:37.080 align:start position:0%
just draw the boundary lines halfway
 
04:48:40.708 --> 04:48:40.718 align:start position:0%
between the meridians oh sure let's see
 
04:48:43.990 --> 04:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
now 75 degrees west 90 degre West
 
04:48:46.750 --> 04:48:46.760 align:start position:0%
halfway between is 82 and 1 half degrees
 
04:48:48.868 --> 04:48:48.878 align:start position:0%
west right smack dab through the city of
 
04:48:52.628 --> 04:48:52.638 align:start position:0%
Tampa Florida H and it gets
 
04:48:57.190 --> 04:48:57.200 align:start position:0%
better 90° West 105 degrees West let's
 
04:49:01.070 --> 04:49:01.080 align:start position:0%
go halfway in between 97 and2 degre west
 
04:49:03.510 --> 04:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
right smack through the middle of the
 
04:49:06.270 --> 04:49:06.280 align:start position:0%
heart of downtown Oklahoma City missing
 
04:49:08.230 --> 04:49:08.240 align:start position:0%
the state capital building by a couple
 
04:49:10.670 --> 04:49:10.680 align:start position:0%
of blocks imagine having a time zone
 
04:49:12.390 --> 04:49:12.400 align:start position:0%
boundary through conquered missing the
 
04:49:15.510 --> 04:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
state house by a couple of blocks lots
 
04:49:18.990 --> 04:49:19.000 align:start position:0%
of fun so it makes sense to adjust the
 
04:49:21.708 --> 04:49:21.718 align:start position:0%
boundaries a little bit to follow county
 
04:49:24.868 --> 04:49:24.878 align:start position:0%
lines and international borders for
 
04:49:27.470 --> 04:49:27.480 align:start position:0%
convenience but uh that's would be a
 
04:49:30.110 --> 04:49:30.120 align:start position:0%
difference between maybe uh 28 minutes
 
04:49:32.990 --> 04:49:33.000 align:start position:0%
slow or 32 minutes fast but here we have
 
04:49:34.670 --> 04:49:34.680 align:start position:0%
a situation where we have a choice
 
04:49:37.788 --> 04:49:37.798 align:start position:0%
between being 13 minutes and 51 seconds
 
04:49:40.788 --> 04:49:40.798 align:start position:0%
slow behind local mean solar time of
 
04:49:44.070 --> 04:49:44.080 align:start position:0%
this building or 46 minutes and 9
 
04:49:46.948 --> 04:49:46.958 align:start position:0%
seconds fast by being on daylight saving
 
04:49:50.110 --> 04:49:50.120 align:start position:0%
time so for this reason while we should
 
04:49:53.390 --> 04:49:53.400 align:start position:0%
discontinue the changing of clocks we
 
04:49:56.430 --> 04:49:56.440 align:start position:0%
also need to select uh Eastern Standard
 
04:49:59.230 --> 04:49:59.240 align:start position:0%
Time as the standard and not permanent
 
04:50:01.670 --> 04:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
daylight saving time which by the way is
 
04:50:03.510 --> 04:50:03.520 align:start position:0%
singular contrary to what some people
 
04:50:06.830 --> 04:50:06.840 align:start position:0%
test ifying here today have done it's uh
 
04:50:08.948 --> 04:50:08.958 align:start position:0%
not daylight savings time it's daylight
 
04:50:10.510 --> 04:50:10.520 align:start position:0%
saving time take a look at the text of
 
04:50:13.150 --> 04:50:13.160 align:start position:0%
the bill there okay
 
04:50:16.190 --> 04:50:16.200 align:start position:0%
so uh as Benjamin Franklin said facts
 
04:50:19.070 --> 04:50:19.080 align:start position:0%
are stubborn John Adams excuse me said
 
04:50:20.830 --> 04:50:20.840 align:start position:0%
facts are stubborn things and whatever
 
04:50:22.708 --> 04:50:22.718 align:start position:0%
may be our wishes our inclinations or
 
04:50:24.510 --> 04:50:24.520 align:start position:0%
the dictates of our passions they cannot
 
04:50:27.990 --> 04:50:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:30.910 --> 04:50:30.920 align:start position:0%
evidence thank
 
04:50:32.830 --> 04:50:32.840 align:start position:0%
you Karen
 
04:50:32.840 --> 04:50:40.788 align:start position:0%
you Karen
Johnson

04:50:40.788 --> 04:50:40.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:40.798 --> 04:50:45.150 align:start position:0%
 
been

04:50:45.150 --> 04:50:45.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:49.390 --> 04:50:49.400 align:start position:0%
C thank you madam chairperson committee
 
04:50:54.948 --> 04:50:54.958 align:start position:0%
um I am here um in support of HB
 
04:50:58.788 --> 04:50:58.798 align:start position:0%
1075 um and oppose HB
 
04:51:01.910 --> 04:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
1679 for permanent daylight savings time
 
04:51:04.548 --> 04:51:04.558 align:start position:0%
um my name is Dr Karen Johnson I'm a
 
04:51:07.270 --> 04:51:07.280 align:start position:0%
sleep physician a neurologist I actually
 
04:51:09.788 --> 04:51:09.798 align:start position:0%
live in Springfield Massachusetts but I
 
04:51:12.150 --> 04:51:12.160 align:start position:0%
have a family in New Hampshire my family
 
04:51:14.230 --> 04:51:14.240 align:start position:0%
owns land in New Hampshire I come up
 
04:51:17.230 --> 04:51:17.240 align:start position:0%
here for skiing and hiking and um
 
04:51:21.470 --> 04:51:21.480 align:start position:0%
Recreation um and so I really strongly
 
04:51:24.150 --> 04:51:24.160 align:start position:0%
urge you to support um permanent
 
04:51:28.070 --> 04:51:28.080 align:start position:0%
Standard Time and age 1075 um for three
 
04:51:30.510 --> 04:51:30.520 align:start position:0%
main reasons permanent Standard Time as
 
04:51:33.070 --> 04:51:33.080 align:start position:0%
we just heard is the more naturally
 
04:51:35.548 --> 04:51:35.558 align:start position:0%
aligned time time and more naturally
 
04:51:39.070 --> 04:51:39.080 align:start position:0%
aligned um suntime is best for our sleep
 
04:51:41.590 --> 04:51:41.600 align:start position:0%
our circadian rhythms which stay aligned
 
04:51:43.670 --> 04:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
with the sun no matter what time we set
 
04:51:47.030 --> 04:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
on our watches and our phones and sleep
 
04:51:48.948 --> 04:51:48.958 align:start position:0%
circadian rhythms is really the pillar
 
04:51:51.590 --> 04:51:51.600 align:start position:0%
of not only physical health um but
 
04:51:54.270 --> 04:51:54.280 align:start position:0%
mental health as well as our cognitive
 
04:51:56.670 --> 04:51:56.680 align:start position:0%
um function which as a neurologist um I
 
04:52:00.190 --> 04:52:00.200 align:start position:0%
think is of of great importance um as we
 
04:52:02.948 --> 04:52:02.958 align:start position:0%
heard before um when we're on the wrong
 
04:52:05.628 --> 04:52:05.638 align:start position:0%
time it affects um you know our ability
 
04:52:07.390 --> 04:52:07.400 align:start position:0%
to get up our ability to get our kids to
 
04:52:09.350 --> 04:52:09.360 align:start position:0%
school our ability for our kids to do
 
04:52:12.310 --> 04:52:12.320 align:start position:0%
well in school um and that affects um
 
04:52:15.190 --> 04:52:15.200 align:start position:0%
our families um it affects our children
 
04:52:17.230 --> 04:52:17.240 align:start position:0%
adolescents have a natural delay in
 
04:52:19.190 --> 04:52:19.200 align:start position:0%
their rhythms so they actually have the
 
04:52:21.470 --> 04:52:21.480 align:start position:0%
highest impact from being on daylight
 
04:52:23.990 --> 04:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
savings time um leading to the most
 
04:52:25.868 --> 04:52:25.878 align:start position:0%
impacts and it's also bad for our
 
04:52:30.830 --> 04:52:30.840 align:start position:0%
overall Workforce most um jobs start um
 
04:52:33.750 --> 04:52:33.760 align:start position:0%
before 8:00 a.m. and those people are
 
04:52:37.270 --> 04:52:37.280 align:start position:0%
more likely to lose sleep um even though
 
04:52:40.150 --> 04:52:40.160 align:start position:0%
a lot of people if you ask them um you
 
04:52:42.350 --> 04:52:42.360 align:start position:0%
know how do you want to end time change
 
04:52:44.510 --> 04:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
most people about 60 to 70% of Americans
 
04:52:46.390 --> 04:52:46.400 align:start position:0%
say we we hate the clock Change we want
 
04:52:48.590 --> 04:52:48.600 align:start position:0%
to end it and and people aren't really
 
04:52:51.070 --> 04:52:51.080 align:start position:0%
sure of what which way to go um a lot of
 
04:52:52.948 --> 04:52:52.958 align:start position:0%
people default to Daylight Savings time
 
04:52:54.510 --> 04:52:54.520 align:start position:0%
because they think of Summer and they
 
04:52:56.070 --> 04:52:56.080 align:start position:0%
think daylight savings time will bring
 
04:52:58.110 --> 04:52:58.120 align:start position:0%
Endless Summer daylight savings time
 
04:53:00.470 --> 04:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
does not add any hours to the day it
 
04:53:03.830 --> 04:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
just shifts the timing of that sun later
 
04:53:06.310 --> 04:53:06.320 align:start position:0%
and um the maps I showed you show what
 
04:53:08.948 --> 04:53:08.958 align:start position:0%
effect it has on the mornings so in New
 
04:53:11.470 --> 04:53:11.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire there would be 60 to 70 days
 
04:53:13.910 --> 04:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
with the sun rising after 8:00 a.m. it
 
04:53:16.788 --> 04:53:16.798 align:start position:0%
would be as late as about 8:20 um in the
 
04:53:19.150 --> 04:53:19.160 align:start position:0%
morning in New Hampshire those dark
 
04:53:21.750 --> 04:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
mornings um again make it harder to get
 
04:53:24.070 --> 04:53:24.080 align:start position:0%
up to get going there's more icy roads
 
04:53:26.430 --> 04:53:26.440 align:start position:0%
to drive on there's kids standing at
 
04:53:29.430 --> 04:53:29.440 align:start position:0%
their bus stops back in 1974 the last
 
04:53:31.110 --> 04:53:31.120 align:start position:0%
time we tried permanent Daylight Savings
 
04:53:32.430 --> 04:53:32.440 align:start position:0%
Time one of the reasons it was so
 
04:53:34.868 --> 04:53:34.878 align:start position:0%
unpopular were kids dying at their bus
 
04:53:37.548 --> 04:53:37.558 align:start position:0%
stops um and again you're basically
 
04:53:40.230 --> 04:53:40.240 align:start position:0%
telling people get up um go to work an
 
04:53:43.510 --> 04:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
hour earlier then your body um is
 
04:53:45.868 --> 04:53:45.878 align:start position:0%
ready in terms of some of the health
 
04:53:48.150 --> 04:53:48.160 align:start position:0%
impacts a lot of people think the only
 
04:53:50.670 --> 04:53:50.680 align:start position:0%
problem is when we make that switch and
 
04:53:52.190 --> 04:53:52.200 align:start position:0%
there are more heart attacks more
 
04:53:54.628 --> 04:53:54.638 align:start position:0%
Strokes more car accidents that happen
 
04:53:56.270 --> 04:53:56.280 align:start position:0%
especially in the spring after we go to
 
04:53:58.310 --> 04:53:58.320 align:start position:0%
Daylight Savings time but what what a
 
04:53:59.830 --> 04:53:59.840 align:start position:0%
lot of people don't realize is our
 
04:54:02.390 --> 04:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
bodies don't adjust within a week or two
 
04:54:05.390 --> 04:54:05.400 align:start position:0%
our bodies stay Al IGN to the um natural
 
04:54:08.788 --> 04:54:08.798 align:start position:0%
Sun time and so that misalignment causes
 
04:54:11.190 --> 04:54:11.200 align:start position:0%
us to lose sleep throughout the whole
 
04:54:13.470 --> 04:54:13.480 align:start position:0%
period of daylight savings time um
 
04:54:15.510 --> 04:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
places that have later sunrises and
 
04:54:17.910 --> 04:54:17.920 align:start position:0%
sunsets have higher rates of obesity
 
04:54:20.430 --> 04:54:20.440 align:start position:0%
higher rates of cancer have higher rates
 
04:54:22.948 --> 04:54:22.958 align:start position:0%
of fatal car crashes higher rates of
 
04:54:24.948 --> 04:54:24.958 align:start position:0%
seasonal depression higher rates of
 
04:54:27.548 --> 04:54:27.558 align:start position:0%
suicide these have been proven with
 
04:54:30.030 --> 04:54:30.040 align:start position:0%
studies that have separated the effect
 
04:54:33.270 --> 04:54:33.280 align:start position:0%
of what is sort of the length of the day
 
04:54:34.788 --> 04:54:34.798 align:start position:0%
so so some of these things get better in
 
04:54:37.350 --> 04:54:37.360 align:start position:0%
summer so you think oh Daylight Savings
 
04:54:38.868 --> 04:54:38.878 align:start position:0%
Time must be better but when you
 
04:54:41.110 --> 04:54:41.120 align:start position:0%
separate that length of the day effect
 
04:54:43.868 --> 04:54:43.878 align:start position:0%
from the time we set our clock effect we
 
04:54:46.150 --> 04:54:46.160 align:start position:0%
know that it's those later clock times
 
04:54:47.590 --> 04:54:47.600 align:start position:0%
that are causing that circadian
 
04:54:50.670 --> 04:54:50.680 align:start position:0%
disruption and causing um these worst
 
04:54:56.590 --> 04:54:56.600 align:start position:0%
outcomes um I want to um talk about uh
 
04:54:59.590 --> 04:54:59.600 align:start position:0%
it was mentioned with the radios um we
 
04:55:03.150 --> 04:55:03.160 align:start position:0%
do think that a national option would be
 
04:55:03.160 --> 04:55:04.030 align:start position:0%
do think that a national option would be
best

04:55:04.030 --> 04:55:04.040 align:start position:0%
best
 
04:55:06.350 --> 04:55:06.360 align:start position:0%
so permanent Standard time is already
 
04:55:09.590 --> 04:55:09.600 align:start position:0%
federally preapproved so any state can
 
04:55:11.350 --> 04:55:11.360 align:start position:0%
just say we want to go on Standard time
 
04:55:13.708 --> 04:55:13.718 align:start position:0%
and it can happen immediately and that
 
04:55:15.948 --> 04:55:15.958 align:start position:0%
is why for the most part we do endorse
 
04:55:18.948 --> 04:55:18.958 align:start position:0%
packed bills to avoid the economic and
 
04:55:21.868 --> 04:55:21.878 align:start position:0%
radio and other issues that we heard
 
04:55:24.070 --> 04:55:24.080 align:start position:0%
before um we have a growing number of
 
04:55:25.948 --> 04:55:25.958 align:start position:0%
states introducing Standard Time bills
 
04:55:29.150 --> 04:55:29.160 align:start position:0%
some are immediate um but for example
 
04:55:31.788 --> 04:55:31.798 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts is saying we would only go
 
04:55:34.910 --> 04:55:34.920 align:start position:0%
forward if New Hampshire Rhode Island um
 
04:55:38.270 --> 04:55:38.280 align:start position:0%
Connecticut and uh who am I forgetting
 
04:55:41.510 --> 04:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
um uh and Rhode Island would um adopt it
 
04:55:44.270 --> 04:55:44.280 align:start position:0%
too Connecticut's Bill is saying you
 
04:55:46.350 --> 04:55:46.360 align:start position:0%
know we will only do it if Massachusetts
 
04:55:48.788 --> 04:55:48.798 align:start position:0%
and New York will only do it so you get
 
04:55:51.830 --> 04:55:51.840 align:start position:0%
these ever increasing packs where it
 
04:55:55.230 --> 04:55:55.240 align:start position:0%
won't actually happen um unless again a
 
04:55:59.110 --> 04:55:59.120 align:start position:0%
bous region um goes forward or more
 
04:56:01.030 --> 04:56:01.040 align:start position:0%
importantly we hope that it just signals
 
04:56:03.750 --> 04:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
the federal government to go forward um
 
04:56:06.868 --> 04:56:06.878 align:start position:0%
we really need to have these State bills
 
04:56:09.110 --> 04:56:09.120 align:start position:0%
pass to show the federal government that
 
04:56:10.990 --> 04:56:11.000 align:start position:0%
there's interest in standard time
 
04:56:13.390 --> 04:56:13.400 align:start position:0%
because the Assumption right now um
 
04:56:15.270 --> 04:56:15.280 align:start position:0%
because some Daylight Savings Time bills
 
04:56:16.910 --> 04:56:16.920 align:start position:0%
have passed before we got out there
 
04:56:19.430 --> 04:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
saying the harms of this that that is
 
04:56:21.830 --> 04:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
what people want we need to tell people
 
04:56:24.230 --> 04:56:24.240 align:start position:0%
in the F girl amendment that no we are
 
04:56:27.750 --> 04:56:27.760 align:start position:0%
interested in um having Standard time so
 
04:56:30.430 --> 04:56:30.440 align:start position:0%
if you want to expand the P you know the
 
04:56:32.310 --> 04:56:32.320 align:start position:0%
states that are listed on this bill I
 
04:56:33.628 --> 04:56:33.638 align:start position:0%
think that could be reason reasonable if
 
04:56:35.230 --> 04:56:35.240 align:start position:0%
you want to make sure that vermonts in
 
04:56:38.350 --> 04:56:38.360 align:start position:0%
there and other ones but just the way
 
04:56:40.110 --> 04:56:40.120 align:start position:0%
the other states are having with their
 
04:56:42.670 --> 04:56:42.680 align:start position:0%
bills um it will be this sort of ever
 
04:56:46.830 --> 04:56:46.840 align:start position:0%
growing pact um you know overall again
 
04:56:49.510 --> 04:56:49.520 align:start position:0%
the reason we made time zones was to
 
04:56:52.070 --> 04:56:52.080 align:start position:0%
align economic interests trains going
 
04:56:54.430 --> 04:56:54.440 align:start position:0%
across um and it was called Standard
 
04:56:56.030 --> 04:56:56.040 align:start position:0%
time because the sun was overhead at
 
04:56:58.470 --> 04:56:58.480 align:start position:0%
noon at the Meridian at the midpoint of
 
04:57:00.788 --> 04:57:00.798 align:start position:0%
the time zone this is the more natural
 
04:57:03.350 --> 04:57:03.360 align:start position:0%
time um daylight savings time was Broad
 
04:57:06.868 --> 04:57:06.878 align:start position:0%
in first in World War II um and then in
 
04:57:09.750 --> 04:57:09.760 align:start position:0%
1974 um as a way to try to get people to
 
04:57:12.430 --> 04:57:12.440 align:start position:0%
go to work an hour earlier um and to
 
04:57:14.628 --> 04:57:14.638 align:start position:0%
save energy they never found that they
 
04:57:17.868 --> 04:57:17.878 align:start position:0%
saved energy um and in fact more recent
 
04:57:19.670 --> 04:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
studies Indiana that used to be mostly
 
04:57:21.350 --> 04:57:21.360 align:start position:0%
on Standard Time found that when they
 
04:57:23.548 --> 04:57:23.558 align:start position:0%
ended Standard time there was actually a
 
04:57:26.548 --> 04:57:26.558 align:start position:0%
1% increase um in energy cost related to
 
04:57:28.868 --> 04:57:28.878 align:start position:0%
increase Heating and Cooling bills so a
 
04:57:31.110 --> 04:57:31.120 align:start position:0%
lot of the more recent um data shows
 
04:57:33.510 --> 04:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
that daylight savings time is actually
 
04:57:36.390 --> 04:57:36.400 align:start position:0%
um causes an increase in energy other
 
04:57:38.548 --> 04:57:38.558 align:start position:0%
data out of Indiana showed that students
 
04:57:42.110 --> 04:57:42.120 align:start position:0%
do worse um on standardized tests um
 
04:57:44.590 --> 04:57:44.600 align:start position:0%
when uh they were in even partial
 
04:57:47.230 --> 04:57:47.240 align:start position:0%
daylight savings time than when they um
 
04:57:50.510 --> 04:57:50.520 align:start position:0%
were on Standard Time so the choice of
 
04:57:52.430 --> 04:57:52.440 align:start position:0%
time is really important affects all our
 
04:57:54.430 --> 04:57:54.440 align:start position:0%
lives we want to end the time change but
 
04:57:56.190 --> 04:57:56.200 align:start position:0%
we need to do it the right way with
 
04:57:58.628 --> 04:57:58.638 align:start position:0%
permanent Standard Time um I'm here on
 
04:58:00.390 --> 04:58:00.400 align:start position:0%
behalf of the Coalition of permanent
 
04:58:03.590 --> 04:58:03.600 align:start position:0%
Standard time which is um made up of the
 
04:58:05.990 --> 04:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
American um Academy of sleep medicine
 
04:58:07.868 --> 04:58:07.878 align:start position:0%
the Sleep research Society the society
 
04:58:11.430 --> 04:58:11.440 align:start position:0%
for research on biological diseases um
 
04:58:13.270 --> 04:58:13.280 align:start position:0%
the national sleep foundation and Stave
 
04:58:15.590 --> 04:58:15.600 align:start position:0%
Standard Time um the American Academy of
 
04:58:17.750 --> 04:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
Neurology also has endorsed it the
 
04:58:19.788 --> 04:58:19.798 align:start position:0%
American thoracic Society um the
 
04:58:23.430 --> 04:58:23.440 align:start position:0%
American Medical Association um other uh
 
04:58:25.110 --> 04:58:25.120 align:start position:0%
teachers groups like the parent teacher
 
04:58:26.910 --> 04:58:26.920 align:start position:0%
Association has endorsed it some
 
04:58:28.788 --> 04:58:28.798 align:start position:0%
religious groups have endorsed permanent
 
04:58:29.948 --> 04:58:29.958 align:start position:0%
Standard time because of the way it
 
04:58:32.590 --> 04:58:32.600 align:start position:0%
affects prayer times so there's a lot of
 
04:58:34.628 --> 04:58:34.638 align:start position:0%
um support report um for a permanent
 
04:58:36.470 --> 04:58:36.480 align:start position:0%
Standard time and we hope you will
 
04:58:37.830 --> 04:58:37.840 align:start position:0%
consider this
 
04:58:40.510 --> 04:58:40.520 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you are there any
 
04:58:46.548 --> 04:58:46.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:50.190 --> 04:58:50.200 align:start position:0%
subte I'm not sure I don't not entirely
 
04:58:53.070 --> 04:58:53.080 align:start position:0%
don't not sure it needs subcommittee but
 
04:58:53.080 --> 04:59:00.670 align:start position:0%
don't not sure it needs subcommittee but
thank

04:59:00.670 --> 04:59:00.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:04.548 --> 04:59:04.558 align:start position:0%
you exactly
 
04:59:07.150 --> 04:59:07.160 align:start position:0%
all right it thank you all right is
 
04:59:09.030 --> 04:59:09.040 align:start position:0%
there anyone else who wishes to testify
 
04:59:12.310 --> 04:59:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:18.708 --> 04:59:18.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:22.430 --> 04:59:22.440 align:start position:0%
elier I won't need to debunk the idea
 
04:59:24.548 --> 04:59:24.558 align:start position:0%
that the argument that the people are
 
04:59:28.628 --> 04:59:28.638 align:start position:0%
more habituated to Daylight Saving Time
 
04:59:30.868 --> 04:59:30.878 align:start position:0%
first of all if we're habituated to
 
04:59:32.070 --> 04:59:32.080 align:start position:0%
Daylight Saving Time when are we going
 
04:59:34.990 --> 04:59:35.000 align:start position:0%
to break that bad half habit if not now
 
04:59:36.670 --> 04:59:36.680 align:start position:0%
and secondly the only reason that we're
 
04:59:38.350 --> 04:59:38.360 align:start position:0%
habituated toward daylight saving time
 
04:59:41.190 --> 04:59:41.200 align:start position:0%
is because we've been forced to if
 
04:59:43.190 --> 04:59:43.200 align:start position:0%
you're told to bring your kids to school
 
04:59:45.948 --> 04:59:45.958 align:start position:0%
by 7:30 they better get there by 6:30
 
04:59:47.830 --> 04:59:47.840 align:start position:0%
when they're pretending it's 7:30 or
 
04:59:50.190 --> 04:59:50.200 align:start position:0%
you're going to get in trouble uh that's
 
04:59:51.590 --> 04:59:51.600 align:start position:0%
what daylight saving time is it's
 
04:59:53.190 --> 04:59:53.200 align:start position:0%
pretending it's an hour later than it
 
04:59:55.070 --> 04:59:55.080 align:start position:0%
really is and if you have to be in court
 
04:59:57.350 --> 04:59:57.360 align:start position:0%
by 9:00 a.m. you better be there at 8:00
 
04:59:59.030 --> 04:59:59.040 align:start position:0%
a.m. when they're pretending it's 9:00
 
05:00:01.910 --> 05:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
a.m. or you're going to jail so it's
 
05:00:03.948 --> 05:00:03.958 align:start position:0%
only because we've been for
 
05:00:06.990 --> 05:00:07.000 align:start position:0%
uh to be habituated to Daylight Saving
 
05:00:11.110 --> 05:00:11.120 align:start position:0%
Time that so uh that's I'm just uh
 
05:00:14.350 --> 05:00:14.360 align:start position:0%
finish with that thank you is there
 
05:00:16.150 --> 05:00:16.160 align:start position:0%
anyone else who wishes to testify on
 
05:00:17.868 --> 05:00:17.878 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
05:00:20.310 --> 05:00:20.320 align:start position:0%
1075 all right not seeing anybody I'm
 
05:00:22.628 --> 05:00:22.638 align:start position:0%
going to close the hearing and open the
 
05:00:25.830 --> 05:00:25.840 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 1679 and call
 
05:00:25.840 --> 05:00:31.910 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 1679 and call
Representative

05:00:31.910 --> 05:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:31.920 --> 05:00:39.990 align:start position:0%
 
Ella

05:00:39.990 --> 05:00:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:42.510 --> 05:00:42.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and members of the
 
05:00:45.150 --> 05:00:45.160 align:start position:0%
committee my name for the record is
 
05:00:48.150 --> 05:00:48.160 align:start position:0%
representative Josh Oella from Fremont
 
05:00:50.030 --> 05:00:50.040 align:start position:0%
Danville and
 
05:00:52.788 --> 05:00:52.798 align:start position:0%
Brentwood and I'm here today to
 
05:00:54.788 --> 05:00:54.798 align:start position:0%
introduce HB
 
05:00:59.310 --> 05:00:59.320 align:start position:0%
1679 um relative to changing to
 
05:01:04.788 --> 05:01:04.798 align:start position:0%
Atlantic time and you um
 
05:01:08.510 --> 05:01:08.520 align:start position:0%
in in um my five years in this
 
05:01:11.150 --> 05:01:11.160 align:start position:0%
legislature I've brought this this bill
 
05:01:16.150 --> 05:01:16.160 align:start position:0%
multiple times and much of the um stuff
 
05:01:18.510 --> 05:01:18.520 align:start position:0%
I've talked about about the the changing
 
05:01:22.110 --> 05:01:22.120 align:start position:0%
of the times has already been said about
 
05:01:23.990 --> 05:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
its detrimental
 
05:01:27.910 --> 05:01:27.920 align:start position:0%
effects however um in the last hearing
 
05:01:31.470 --> 05:01:31.480 align:start position:0%
and in years prior so I uh did not print
 
05:01:35.110 --> 05:01:35.120 align:start position:0%
out the voluminous documentation on that
 
05:01:39.868 --> 05:01:39.878 align:start position:0%
um so it seems like today there's um uh
 
05:01:43.030 --> 05:01:43.040 align:start position:0%
two different approaches what both are
 
05:01:44.990 --> 05:01:45.000 align:start position:0%
in agreement that switching the the
 
05:01:49.948 --> 05:01:49.958 align:start position:0%
times are are uh not beneficial both
 
05:01:53.430 --> 05:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
healthwise economic wise for a host of
 
05:01:58.548 --> 05:01:58.558 align:start position:0%
reasons um and this method of uh
 
05:02:00.948 --> 05:02:00.958 align:start position:0%
changing to Atlantic Atlantic Standard
 
05:02:03.670 --> 05:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
time is the
 
05:02:09.868 --> 05:02:09.878 align:start position:0%
uh preferred method uh by many people um
 
05:02:15.948 --> 05:02:15.958 align:start position:0%
by their advocacy for not dislike for uh
 
05:02:18.670 --> 05:02:18.680 align:start position:0%
super early
 
05:02:22.830 --> 05:02:22.840 align:start position:0%
uh uh sunsets and and getting off of
 
05:02:26.868 --> 05:02:26.878 align:start position:0%
work essentially in the dark and um I
 
05:02:30.548 --> 05:02:30.558 align:start position:0%
would point you to the uh 2017 special
 
05:02:33.110 --> 05:02:33.120 align:start position:0%
Commission on the Commonwealth uh time
 
05:02:35.110 --> 05:02:35.120 align:start position:0%
zone that I had previously uh given in
 
05:02:37.510 --> 05:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
years past to this committee but can be
 
05:02:39.628 --> 05:02:39.638 align:start position:0%
uh can be found
 
05:02:44.830 --> 05:02:44.840 align:start position:0%
online uh that talks about uh this this
 
05:02:47.070 --> 05:02:47.080 align:start position:0%
issue and the benefits of it in in
 
05:02:50.868 --> 05:02:50.878 align:start position:0%
relation to the uh
 
05:02:55.708 --> 05:02:55.718 align:start position:0%
Northeast and I bring this uh and I am
 
05:02:59.510 --> 05:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
in agreement obviously that that uh the
 
05:03:02.110 --> 05:03:02.120 align:start position:0%
Senate at the federal level I'm I'm
 
05:03:05.350 --> 05:03:05.360 align:start position:0%
happy what they did as far as passing um
 
05:03:07.590 --> 05:03:07.600 align:start position:0%
a bill that would have allowed uh
 
05:03:10.150 --> 05:03:10.160 align:start position:0%
daylight savings time all year round uh
 
05:03:12.110 --> 05:03:12.120 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill
 
05:03:18.030 --> 05:03:18.040 align:start position:0%
1623 um in 2022 in Congress but uh that
 
05:03:21.990 --> 05:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
bill was uh failed in in the um house it
 
05:03:25.230 --> 05:03:25.240 align:start position:0%
wasn't acted upon and so there is still
 
05:03:28.510 --> 05:03:28.520 align:start position:0%
an effort in the Northeast by many of
 
05:03:32.030 --> 05:03:32.040 align:start position:0%
the states ongoing to move to Daylight
 
05:03:35.708 --> 05:03:35.718 align:start position:0%
Savings Time or uh all year round or uh
 
05:03:39.750 --> 05:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
Atlantic's time zone there is no um
 
05:03:42.230 --> 05:03:42.240 align:start position:0%
other state considering doing Standard
 
05:03:45.150 --> 05:03:45.160 align:start position:0%
time all year round in the Northeast um
 
05:03:48.470 --> 05:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh Massachusetts currently
 
05:03:49.910 --> 05:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
has a bill
 
05:03:53.788 --> 05:03:53.798 align:start position:0%
3050 that is doing Atlantic time zone
 
05:03:55.350 --> 05:03:55.360 align:start position:0%
all year
 
05:03:59.390 --> 05:03:59.400 align:start position:0%
round uh Connecticut is doing at uh
 
05:04:02.110 --> 05:04:02.120 align:start position:0%
proposing a bill for Atlantic time zone
 
05:04:03.868 --> 05:04:03.878 align:start position:0%
all year
 
05:04:07.270 --> 05:04:07.280 align:start position:0%
uh Vermont is proposing daylight savings
 
05:04:08.750 --> 05:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
time all year
 
05:04:12.510 --> 05:04:12.520 align:start position:0%
round uh and New York is proposing
 
05:04:14.910 --> 05:04:14.920 align:start position:0%
daylight savings time all year
 
05:04:18.230 --> 05:04:18.240 align:start position:0%
round those all have the same net effect
 
05:04:21.430 --> 05:04:21.440 align:start position:0%
of being on the exact same time and it's
 
05:04:24.390 --> 05:04:24.400 align:start position:0%
not the Eastern Standard time
 
05:04:31.910 --> 05:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
zone um and so if you were to um be uh
 
05:04:36.150 --> 05:04:36.160 align:start position:0%
trying to go so with the the rest of the
 
05:04:38.830 --> 05:04:38.840 align:start position:0%
uh states in the region they have
 
05:04:42.390 --> 05:04:42.400 align:start position:0%
unanimously decided that doing either
 
05:04:44.350 --> 05:04:44.360 align:start position:0%
daylight savings time all year round if
 
05:04:47.270 --> 05:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
the federal government allows that or Mo
 
05:04:50.230 --> 05:04:50.240 align:start position:0%
requesting to move to Atlantic time
 
05:04:53.150 --> 05:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
zone uh from the Secretary of
 
05:04:56.830 --> 05:04:56.840 align:start position:0%
Transportation those are the methods uh
 
05:04:58.868 --> 05:04:58.878 align:start position:0%
that that the states have been ProMag
 
05:05:02.190 --> 05:05:02.200 align:start position:0%
gating in the legislature um currently
 
05:05:02.200 --> 05:05:03.030 align:start position:0%
gating in the legislature um currently
and

05:05:03.030 --> 05:05:03.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:05:05.830 --> 05:05:05.840 align:start position:0%
so my my bill this time is a little bit
 
05:05:08.788 --> 05:05:08.798 align:start position:0%
more complicated than in years past and
 
05:05:12.548 --> 05:05:12.558 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons for that is um the
 
05:05:15.708 --> 05:05:15.718 align:start position:0%
the piece of paper that I passed around
 
05:05:19.910 --> 05:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
is uh the document from the Department
 
05:05:22.430 --> 05:05:22.440 align:start position:0%
of Transportation uh the US Department
 
05:05:25.590 --> 05:05:25.600 align:start position:0%
of Transportation on um kind of how they
 
05:05:27.788 --> 05:05:27.798 align:start position:0%
decide whether or not you're allowed to
 
05:05:30.110 --> 05:05:30.120 align:start position:0%
move to a different time zone or not and
 
05:05:34.310 --> 05:05:34.320 align:start position:0%
some of the things that they require is
 
05:05:37.788 --> 05:05:37.798 align:start position:0%
information about um where do businesses
 
05:05:39.030 --> 05:05:39.040 align:start position:0%
get their supplies and where do they
 
05:05:41.310 --> 05:05:41.320 align:start position:0%
ship their goods and products and and
 
05:05:43.750 --> 05:05:43.760 align:start position:0%
and even the media uh broadcast where
 
05:05:46.910 --> 05:05:46.920 align:start position:0%
those come from and uh
 
05:05:51.030 --> 05:05:51.040 align:start position:0%
so the the intro the bill as introduced
 
05:05:54.430 --> 05:05:54.440 align:start position:0%
would essentially have a commission of
 
05:05:58.230 --> 05:05:58.240 align:start position:0%
all those states that agree um come
 
05:06:01.070 --> 05:06:01.080 align:start position:0%
together form together and um compile
 
05:06:03.948 --> 05:06:03.958 align:start position:0%
that information for the and submit that
 
05:06:06.948 --> 05:06:06.958 align:start position:0%
to the Secretary of Transportation um so
 
05:06:08.990 --> 05:06:09.000 align:start position:0%
so that it's a unified message so that
 
05:06:12.390 --> 05:06:12.400 align:start position:0%
we can get approved for the moving of
 
05:06:17.110 --> 05:06:17.120 align:start position:0%
the time zone um so that is the why the
 
05:06:18.948 --> 05:06:18.958 align:start position:0%
bill is a little bit longer than than
 
05:06:21.030 --> 05:06:21.040 align:start position:0%
before other states just say we're just
 
05:06:24.470 --> 05:06:24.480 align:start position:0%
going to move um or you know once once
 
05:06:27.628 --> 05:06:27.638 align:start position:0%
the other other states adopt it but in
 
05:06:28.910 --> 05:06:28.920 align:start position:0%
fact you have to request that
 
05:06:31.590 --> 05:06:31.600 align:start position:0%
information from the uh or that that
 
05:06:34.030 --> 05:06:34.040 align:start position:0%
change from the the the Secretary of
 
05:06:37.150 --> 05:06:37.160 align:start position:0%
Transportation and this bill helps uh
 
05:06:39.590 --> 05:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
you prepare the information to go to
 
05:06:41.390 --> 05:06:41.400 align:start position:0%
there so that it can get approved so I'm
 
05:06:49.510 --> 05:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:54.390 --> 05:06:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:58.150 --> 05:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
Bic years ago many years ago I guess my
 
05:06:59.990 --> 05:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
company sent me to California for a
 
05:07:05.590 --> 05:07:05.600 align:start position:0%
month sorry and uh all the TV shows we
 
05:07:07.708 --> 05:07:07.718 align:start position:0%
traditionally thought of as evening TV
 
05:07:10.788 --> 05:07:10.798 align:start position:0%
shows right were all on in the late
 
05:07:13.390 --> 05:07:13.400 align:start position:0%
afternoon I
 
05:07:16.470 --> 05:07:16.480 align:start position:0%
guess I guess that was their cow Towing
 
05:07:18.868 --> 05:07:18.878 align:start position:0%
to New York maybe or the East
 
05:07:20.910 --> 05:07:20.920 align:start position:0%
Coast because they were all the evening
 
05:07:23.190 --> 05:07:23.200 align:start position:0%
shows but late
 
05:07:25.788 --> 05:07:25.798 align:start position:0%
afternoon uh do we give a damn what
 
05:07:27.708 --> 05:07:27.718 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and Main think let's just
 
05:07:33.350 --> 05:07:33.360 align:start position:0%
do it thank you for the question um from
 
05:07:34.910 --> 05:07:34.920 align:start position:0%
California's perspective I'm sure they
 
05:07:36.948 --> 05:07:36.958 align:start position:0%
consider them afternoon shows and you
 
05:07:38.788 --> 05:07:38.798 align:start position:0%
and uh that you're just watching them at
 
05:07:44.150 --> 05:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
the wrong time um but uh I I do think
 
05:07:47.030 --> 05:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
that the uh I do agree that it would be
 
05:07:51.470 --> 05:07:51.480 align:start position:0%
beneficial to move however there is um
 
05:07:54.030 --> 05:07:54.040 align:start position:0%
significant uh
 
05:07:54.040 --> 05:07:56.110 align:start position:0%
significant uh
economic

05:07:56.110 --> 05:07:56.120 align:start position:0%
economic
 
05:07:58.628 --> 05:07:58.638 align:start position:0%
um ties between New Hampshire and
 
05:08:01.190 --> 05:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and the and and Maine and
 
05:08:04.350 --> 05:08:04.360 align:start position:0%
so for the people that that live in New
 
05:08:08.230 --> 05:08:08.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and work in those uh States I
 
05:08:10.350 --> 05:08:10.360 align:start position:0%
think it's a little bit different than
 
05:08:13.990 --> 05:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
the the Arizona example where most uh
 
05:08:16.230 --> 05:08:16.240 align:start position:0%
that there are isn't really big cities
 
05:08:20.230 --> 05:08:20.240 align:start position:0%
right on the the border that would be
 
05:08:23.270 --> 05:08:23.280 align:start position:0%
majorly affected um as as much as
 
05:08:25.628 --> 05:08:25.638 align:start position:0%
essentially our a significant portion of
 
05:08:25.638 --> 05:08:26.510 align:start position:0%
essentially our a significant portion of
our

05:08:26.510 --> 05:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
our
 
05:08:29.590 --> 05:08:29.600 align:start position:0%
population uh going across state lines
 
05:08:33.868 --> 05:08:33.878 align:start position:0%
for for work and stuff like that so I do
 
05:08:36.548 --> 05:08:36.558 align:start position:0%
I do agree that there is um that there
 
05:08:39.670 --> 05:08:39.680 align:start position:0%
is some benefit of going as as a group
 
05:08:41.990 --> 05:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
but I'm not opposed to just going going
 
05:08:44.190 --> 05:08:44.200 align:start position:0%
on our own but I don't I don't work in
 
05:08:45.670 --> 05:08:45.680 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts so I wouldn't be
 
05:08:47.150 --> 05:08:47.160 align:start position:0%
negatively affected like some other
 
05:08:49.670 --> 05:08:49.680 align:start position:0%
people so I
 
05:08:53.230 --> 05:08:53.240 align:start position:0%
followup would we then say that
 
05:08:55.390 --> 05:08:55.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is the tail being wagged by
 
05:08:55.400 --> 05:09:00.230 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is the tail being wagged by
the

05:09:00.230 --> 05:09:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:03.270 --> 05:09:03.280 align:start position:0%
dog I'm not sure how to respond to that
 
05:09:06.150 --> 05:09:06.160 align:start position:0%
I will than you never thank
 
05:09:09.270 --> 05:09:09.280 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
05:09:11.510 --> 05:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
Brown thank you madam
 
05:09:15.430 --> 05:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
chair based on some of the handouts and
 
05:09:19.510 --> 05:09:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:19.520 --> 05:09:21.430 align:start position:0%
 
already

05:09:21.430 --> 05:09:21.440 align:start position:0%
already
 
05:09:24.070 --> 05:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
there's it is said that your circadian
 
05:09:26.350 --> 05:09:26.360 align:start position:0%
rhythm doesn't change if I'm
 
05:09:28.270 --> 05:09:28.280 align:start position:0%
understanding it correctly and there's a
 
05:09:30.310 --> 05:09:30.320 align:start position:0%
certain time frame that's better for
 
05:09:32.788 --> 05:09:32.798 align:start position:0%
that so
 
05:09:35.350 --> 05:09:35.360 align:start position:0%
let's say you moved to
 
05:09:37.910 --> 05:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
California your circadian
 
05:09:40.270 --> 05:09:40.280 align:start position:0%
rhythm stays the way it was as a New
 
05:09:40.280 --> 05:09:41.868 align:start position:0%
rhythm stays the way it was as a New
Hampshire

05:09:41.868 --> 05:09:41.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
05:09:45.990 --> 05:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:49.150 --> 05:09:49.160 align:start position:0%
relate so being being that question if
 
05:09:51.590 --> 05:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
we change the time zone here and someone
 
05:09:53.310 --> 05:09:53.320 align:start position:0%
moves how does that help them or how
 
05:09:55.788 --> 05:09:55.798 align:start position:0%
does it not help them thank you thank
 
05:09:57.030 --> 05:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
you for the question that makes the
 
05:09:59.310 --> 05:09:59.320 align:start position:0%
slightest bit of sense um I think I
 
05:10:02.190 --> 05:10:02.200 align:start position:0%
think thank you for the question but um
 
05:10:03.868 --> 05:10:03.878 align:start position:0%
um as someone that was born in
 
05:10:07.270 --> 05:10:07.280 align:start position:0%
California and I moved here I do uh
 
05:10:10.190 --> 05:10:10.200 align:start position:0%
think your uh the circadium rhythm is
 
05:10:12.510 --> 05:10:12.520 align:start position:0%
based on the sunlight and so you have
 
05:10:15.310 --> 05:10:15.320 align:start position:0%
different sunlight here and so you're
 
05:10:17.590 --> 05:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
over a certain amount of time of living
 
05:10:19.230 --> 05:10:19.240 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire your circum Rhythm
 
05:10:21.310 --> 05:10:21.320 align:start position:0%
would would reflect the sunlight that
 
05:10:22.990 --> 05:10:23.000 align:start position:0%
you're getting here you're not no longer
 
05:10:24.548 --> 05:10:24.558 align:start position:0%
getting the sunlight in California right
 
05:10:27.510 --> 05:10:27.520 align:start position:0%
so your cirium Rhythm would slowly over
 
05:10:32.070 --> 05:10:32.080 align:start position:0%
um overtime shift to reflect that uh new
 
05:10:34.590 --> 05:10:34.600 align:start position:0%
place that you're living and so uh that
 
05:10:36.548 --> 05:10:36.558 align:start position:0%
is kind of what a lot of people talk
 
05:10:37.990 --> 05:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
about is like jet lag and stuff like
 
05:10:39.910 --> 05:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
that is your circadian rhythm kind of
 
05:10:43.190 --> 05:10:43.200 align:start position:0%
adjusting again um to that other other
 
05:10:43.200 --> 05:10:44.150 align:start position:0%
adjusting again um to that other other
time

05:10:44.150 --> 05:10:44.160 align:start position:0%
time
 
05:10:48.070 --> 05:10:48.080 align:start position:0%
zone um so I think that hopefully that
 
05:10:50.270 --> 05:10:50.280 align:start position:0%
answers your question that's thank you
 
05:10:52.910 --> 05:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
other questions all right I don't see
 
05:10:54.470 --> 05:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
any other questions thank you for your
 
05:10:57.390 --> 05:10:57.400 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you is there anyone else
 
05:11:00.948 --> 05:11:00.958 align:start position:0%
who wishes to testify on House Bill
 
05:11:00.958 --> 05:11:14.150 align:start position:0%
who wishes to testify on House Bill
1679

05:11:14.150 --> 05:11:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:18.990 --> 05:11:19.000 align:start position:0%
yes I just do want to clarify
 
05:11:22.190 --> 05:11:22.200 align:start position:0%
please I do just want to uh clarify
 
05:11:25.628 --> 05:11:25.638 align:start position:0%
where the bills stand there are both um
 
05:11:27.110 --> 05:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
permanent daylight savings time which
 
05:11:28.990 --> 05:11:29.000 align:start position:0%
are couched as Atlantic Standard Time
 
05:11:30.110 --> 05:11:30.120 align:start position:0%
the reason they're doing that is they're
 
05:11:31.990 --> 05:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
trying to get around the Federal
 
05:11:33.948 --> 05:11:33.958 align:start position:0%
prohibition against Daylight Savings
 
05:11:35.990 --> 05:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
Time by changing the time zone rather
 
05:11:39.628 --> 05:11:39.638 align:start position:0%
than changing to the the the whether
 
05:11:40.990 --> 05:11:41.000 align:start position:0%
you're on Standard time or daylight
 
05:11:44.350 --> 05:11:44.360 align:start position:0%
savings time um but there are bills in
 
05:11:48.990 --> 05:11:49.000 align:start position:0%
um Massachusetts in um Vermont and in
 
05:11:51.510 --> 05:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire for both directions right
 
05:11:53.708 --> 05:11:53.718 align:start position:0%
now um last year they haven't been
 
05:11:55.830 --> 05:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
reintroduced in 2024 there were
 
05:11:57.990 --> 05:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
Connecticut bills so there are a lot of
 
05:12:00.070 --> 05:12:00.080 align:start position:0%
bills in our area Maine currently has a
 
05:12:02.470 --> 05:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
study that is studying it so there's a
 
05:12:04.590 --> 05:12:04.600 align:start position:0%
lot of active bills um and they're
 
05:12:06.948 --> 05:12:06.958 align:start position:0%
equally as much for standard time in
 
05:12:08.590 --> 05:12:08.600 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts we actually have more
 
05:12:10.708 --> 05:12:10.718 align:start position:0%
sponsors for the Standard Time bill then
 
05:12:12.750 --> 05:12:12.760 align:start position:0%
the daylight savings time Bill in the
 
05:12:15.708 --> 05:12:15.718 align:start position:0%
federal government they tried to sneak
 
05:12:19.470 --> 05:12:19.480 align:start position:0%
the um bill past uh the the how they
 
05:12:22.110 --> 05:12:22.120 align:start position:0%
brought up for emergency vote uh sort of
 
05:12:24.548 --> 05:12:24.558 align:start position:0%
last minute vote um and it did pass the
 
05:12:27.310 --> 05:12:27.320 align:start position:0%
Senate but was not taken up by the house
 
05:12:29.110 --> 05:12:29.120 align:start position:0%
um there was actually less sponsors that
 
05:12:31.510 --> 05:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
signed on for the 2023 version of the
 
05:12:34.110 --> 05:12:34.120 align:start position:0%
bill than the 2022 version bill so we
 
05:12:36.590 --> 05:12:36.600 align:start position:0%
are seeing the movement towards more and
 
05:12:38.990 --> 05:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
more Standard Time bills less support
 
05:12:41.030 --> 05:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
for Daylight Savings Time bills last
 
05:12:43.070 --> 05:12:43.080 align:start position:0%
year no Daylight Savings Time bills
 
05:12:45.548 --> 05:12:45.558 align:start position:0%
passed any states um for the first time
 
05:12:47.868 --> 05:12:47.878 align:start position:0%
in a few years because of the increasing
 
05:12:50.430 --> 05:12:50.440 align:start position:0%
education um that it is less aligned
 
05:12:53.910 --> 05:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
with our Natural Body thank you thank
 
05:12:57.750 --> 05:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
you all right anyone else all right I'm
 
05:13:00.750 --> 05:13:00.760 align:start position:0%
closing the hearing on House Bill
 
05:13:00.760 --> 05:13:02.868 align:start position:0%
closing the hearing on House Bill
1679

05:13:02.868 --> 05:13:02.878 align:start position:0%
1679
 
05:13:05.750 --> 05:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
and we're going on to the subcommittee
 
05:13:09.910 --> 05:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:12.750 --> 05:13:12.760 align:start position:0%
bill House Bill
 
05:13:15.390 --> 05:13:15.400 align:start position:0%
1689 relative to the use of person
 
05:13:17.788 --> 05:13:17.798 align:start position:0%
identifying information by state
 
05:13:19.788 --> 05:13:19.798 align:start position:0%
agencies but first we're going to take a
 
05:13:21.070 --> 05:13:21.080 align:start position:0%
five minute break we are going to take a
 
05:13:22.150 --> 05:13:22.160 align:start position:0%
five minute
 
05:13:30.750 --> 05:13:30.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:30.760 --> 05:13:32.270 align:start position:0%
 
you

05:13:32.270 --> 05:13:32.280 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:13:34.868 --> 05:13:34.878 align:start position:0%
it's always nice that the
 
05:13:38.590 --> 05:13:38.600 align:start position:0%
uh that the Standard Time folks are
 
05:13:41.070 --> 05:13:41.080 align:start position:0%
opposed to the daylight this was going
 
05:13:44.548 --> 05:13:44.558 align:start position:0%
to subit I didn't mean to say no but at
 
05:13:46.948 --> 05:13:46.958 align:start position:0%
the same time I'm think oh my why do we
 
05:13:48.868 --> 05:13:48.878 align:start position:0%
need to talk about this some
 
05:13:52.310 --> 05:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
more you're not on subte you're
 
05:13:54.708 --> 05:13:54.718 align:start position:0%
done if you're not on the subcommittee
 
05:14:00.670 --> 05:14:00.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:00.680 --> 05:18:54.390 align:start position:0%
 
forward

05:18:54.390 --> 05:18:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:56.948 --> 05:18:56.958 align:start position:0%
we going to stop at 4:30 because that
 
05:18:59.230 --> 05:18:59.240 align:start position:0%
way we don't have to have extra
 
05:19:01.510 --> 05:19:01.520 align:start position:0%
security um clearance because as the
 
05:19:03.788 --> 05:19:03.798 align:start position:0%
building closes at
 
05:19:06.510 --> 05:19:06.520 align:start position:0%
4:30 which but we should have plenty of
 
05:19:18.030 --> 05:19:18.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:20.150 --> 05:19:20.160 align:start position:0%
hopefully you're going to be stuck here
 
05:19:30.230 --> 05:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:30.240 --> 05:21:12.390 align:start position:0%
 
California

05:21:12.390 --> 05:21:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:13.868 --> 05:21:13.878 align:start position:0%
I'm going to start the subcommittee
 
05:21:16.868 --> 05:21:16.878 align:start position:0%
meeting um the way that I'd like to have
 
05:21:16.878 --> 05:21:18.310 align:start position:0%
meeting um the way that I'd like to have
this

05:21:18.310 --> 05:21:18.320 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:21:22.350 --> 05:21:22.360 align:start position:0%
subcommittee um go today is that we have
 
05:21:24.868 --> 05:21:24.878 align:start position:0%
some um people here from the Secretary
 
05:21:26.910 --> 05:21:26.920 align:start position:0%
of State's office who are going to talk
 
05:21:31.070 --> 05:21:31.080 align:start position:0%
about the um safety and the Privacy meas
 
05:21:32.310 --> 05:21:32.320 align:start position:0%
measures that they take and the
 
05:21:34.628 --> 05:21:34.638 align:start position:0%
information that they need and then
 
05:21:38.070 --> 05:21:38.080 align:start position:0%

them and then we can discuss the HHS
 
05:21:43.990 --> 05:21:44.000 align:start position:0%

05:22:36.110 --> 05:22:36.120 align:start position:0%
statutes that I had identified as we
 
05:22:38.510 --> 05:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
could have some um we would need
 
05:22:40.590 --> 05:22:40.600 align:start position:0%
clarification on and I gave that
 
05:22:43.430 --> 05:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
testimony the other day where um we need
 
05:22:45.030 --> 05:22:45.040 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we're very clearly
 
05:22:47.590 --> 05:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
handling this bill if it passes I need
 
05:22:49.030 --> 05:22:49.040 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we can still issue
 
05:22:51.110 --> 05:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
certified copies to other um
 
05:22:53.310 --> 05:22:53.320 align:start position:0%

05:22:56.200 --> 05:22:57.430 align:start position:0%
DHHS because we do deal a lot with um
Social

05:22:57.430 --> 05:22:57.440 align:start position:0%
Social
 
05:23:00.350 --> 05:23:00.360 align:start position:0%
Security Department of Justice um
 
05:23:02.910 --> 05:23:02.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections we have anou
 
05:23:05.110 --> 05:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
with um so I'm I'm basically here to
 
05:23:08.990 --> 05:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
answer any questions you have as far as
 
05:23:12.510 --> 05:23:12.520 align:start position:0%
um how we handle our
 
05:23:14.670 --> 05:23:14.680 align:start position:0%
information there seems to be a lot of
 
05:23:18.070 --> 05:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
concern about the Privacy issue so how
 
05:23:20.350 --> 05:23:20.360 align:start position:0%
is it that this is maintained and how is
 
05:23:23.590 --> 05:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
it audited so that we know that it's um
 
05:23:26.830 --> 05:23:26.840 align:start position:0%
always up to date so when information is
 
05:23:29.110 --> 05:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
input into our neverin database and our
 
05:23:31.270 --> 05:23:31.280 align:start position:0%
never database is um the new Hampshire
 
05:23:33.230 --> 05:23:33.240 align:start position:0%
Vital Records Information Network it's
 
05:23:35.670 --> 05:23:35.680 align:start position:0%
it's a just a what's the word I'm
 
05:23:38.830 --> 05:23:38.840 align:start position:0%
looking for acronym thank you for what
 
05:23:40.548 --> 05:23:40.558 align:start position:0%
that stands for that's our database that
 
05:23:43.030 --> 05:23:43.040 align:start position:0%
holds all of our Vital Records right now
 
05:23:45.310 --> 05:23:45.320 align:start position:0%
so it gets entered in and anybody who
 
05:23:48.708 --> 05:23:48.718 align:start position:0%
accesses it is um a user that signs up
 
05:23:50.628 --> 05:23:50.638 align:start position:0%
and they get clearance depending on what
 
05:23:52.670 --> 05:23:52.680 align:start position:0%
their role is we assign them certain
 
05:23:54.830 --> 05:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
access levels within that system it's
 
05:23:56.590 --> 05:23:56.600 align:start position:0%
very very strict so when you start
 
05:23:57.628 --> 05:23:57.638 align:start position:0%
getting to the point that we're
 
05:23:59.670 --> 05:23:59.680 align:start position:0%
involving health statistics that are
 
05:24:01.788 --> 05:24:01.798 align:start position:0%
being collected as part a vital record
 
05:24:03.390 --> 05:24:03.400 align:start position:0%
there's only a handful of us that
 
05:24:05.110 --> 05:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
actually can see it within the division
 
05:24:07.470 --> 05:24:07.480 align:start position:0%
of Vital Records um there was a bill
 
05:24:09.110 --> 05:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
that I testified on this morning and I
 
05:24:10.708 --> 05:24:10.718 align:start position:0%
just make a clarifying point that when
 
05:24:12.590 --> 05:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
they say the Secretary of State's office
 
05:24:13.990 --> 05:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
has access to this they're actually
 
05:24:16.390 --> 05:24:16.400 align:start position:0%
referring to my division and only those
 
05:24:19.150 --> 05:24:19.160 align:start position:0%
of us with high admin levels at the at
 
05:24:22.390 --> 05:24:22.400 align:start position:0%
the division um as far as access to
 
05:24:23.750 --> 05:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
Vital Records the state of New Hampshire
 
05:24:25.830 --> 05:24:25.840 align:start position:0%
all V vital records are closed so you
 
05:24:27.510 --> 05:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
can't just go in and ask for a copy of
 
05:24:29.190 --> 05:24:29.200 align:start position:0%
anybody's record you actually have to
 
05:24:30.788 --> 05:24:30.798 align:start position:0%
have what's called a direct and tangible
 
05:24:32.310 --> 05:24:32.320 align:start position:0%
interest in the record in order to
 
05:24:35.590 --> 05:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
obtain it right now um DHHS is
 
05:24:37.310 --> 05:24:37.320 align:start position:0%
considered having a direct and tangible
 
05:24:39.270 --> 05:24:39.280 align:start position:0%
interest in our Vital Records and
 
05:24:41.470 --> 05:24:41.480 align:start position:0%
statistics just based off of their work
 
05:24:43.350 --> 05:24:43.360 align:start position:0%
in our memorandum of understanding that
 
05:24:46.868 --> 05:24:46.878 align:start position:0%
we have in place um so this bill we need
 
05:24:49.670 --> 05:24:49.680 align:start position:0%
to clarify how that would affect their
 
05:24:51.470 --> 05:24:51.480 align:start position:0%
direct and tangible interest if it's
 
05:24:53.750 --> 05:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
only to the identifying information
 
05:24:55.270 --> 05:24:55.280 align:start position:0%
that's being collected with the health
 
05:24:57.470 --> 05:24:57.480 align:start position:0%
statistics or if I'm not allowed to give
 
05:24:59.990 --> 05:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
them um certified copies of Records like
 
05:25:01.990 --> 05:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
what does that look like for us at the
 
05:25:04.868 --> 05:25:04.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:06.830 --> 05:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
division anyone on the committee have
 
05:25:06.840 --> 05:25:09.390 align:start position:0%
division anyone on the committee have
any

05:25:09.390 --> 05:25:09.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:12.390 --> 05:25:12.400 align:start position:0%
questions this is sort of along the same
 
05:25:15.150 --> 05:25:15.160 align:start position:0%
lines um when I was listening to the
 
05:25:17.948 --> 05:25:17.958 align:start position:0%
testimony the other day I I have to ask
 
05:25:20.430 --> 05:25:20.440 align:start position:0%
you do you think there's anything
 
05:25:23.750 --> 05:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
broken that that was trying to be fixed
 
05:25:25.590 --> 05:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
from an administrative standpoint from
 
05:25:27.470 --> 05:25:27.480 align:start position:0%
an administrative standpoint I've not
 
05:25:30.270 --> 05:25:30.280 align:start position:0%
had any concerns uh we're very careful
 
05:25:32.590 --> 05:25:32.600 align:start position:0%
with the data that we're giving
 
05:25:35.150 --> 05:25:35.160 align:start position:0%
out thank you it's one of our top
 
05:25:37.548 --> 05:25:37.558 align:start position:0%
priorities um we actually even take hipa
 
05:25:39.150 --> 05:25:39.160 align:start position:0%
training even though we're not required
 
05:25:41.310 --> 05:25:41.320 align:start position:0%
to because we're not hipa entities we go
 
05:25:45.948 --> 05:25:45.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:45.958 --> 05:25:48.390 align:start position:0%
 
beyond

05:25:48.390 --> 05:25:48.400 align:start position:0%
beyond
 
05:25:51.350 --> 05:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
and are there policies that you know how
 
05:25:54.230 --> 05:25:54.240 align:start position:0%
do you maintain the confidentiality I
 
05:25:56.190 --> 05:25:56.200 align:start position:0%
mean how is this communicated within
 
05:25:57.910 --> 05:25:57.920 align:start position:0%
your organization it's all within the
 
05:26:01.070 --> 05:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
statutes and for anybody who's in house
 
05:26:02.510 --> 05:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
um we work very closely together with
 
05:26:04.350 --> 05:26:04.360 align:start position:0%
training so any of the division of idal
 
05:26:07.788 --> 05:26:07.798 align:start position:0%
Records users um it's all in training we
 
05:26:09.190 --> 05:26:09.200 align:start position:0%
can't give this information now you
 
05:26:10.628 --> 05:26:10.638 align:start position:0%
can't just go in and start looking
 
05:26:12.110 --> 05:26:12.120 align:start position:0%
things up because you feel like looking
 
05:26:14.070 --> 05:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
things up that's not how this works it's
 
05:26:16.708 --> 05:26:16.718 align:start position:0%
got to be initiated for a specific
 
05:26:19.350 --> 05:26:19.360 align:start position:0%
purpose and and your role only allows
 
05:26:22.510 --> 05:26:22.520 align:start position:0%
you a certain um Viewpoint of what you
 
05:26:25.270 --> 05:26:25.280 align:start position:0%
can see within the record itself the
 
05:26:27.270 --> 05:26:27.280 align:start position:0%
other users like for example your your
 
05:26:29.670 --> 05:26:29.680 align:start position:0%
town clerk's users or Funeral Directors
 
05:26:32.190 --> 05:26:32.200 align:start position:0%
whoever it is that can have access when
 
05:26:34.628 --> 05:26:34.638 align:start position:0%
they sign up to gain access there's a
 
05:26:37.390 --> 05:26:37.400 align:start position:0%
very strict list of what you can and
 
05:26:40.948 --> 05:26:40.958 align:start position:0%
cannot do this is your activity within
 
05:26:44.310 --> 05:26:44.320 align:start position:0%
the system is being monitored um you and
 
05:26:46.990 --> 05:26:47.000 align:start position:0%
limited so depending on what the role is
 
05:26:49.030 --> 05:26:49.040 align:start position:0%
they can only see so
 
05:26:51.868 --> 05:26:51.878 align:start position:0%
much thank you Mr Wilder can you explain
 
05:26:54.110 --> 05:26:54.120 align:start position:0%
to the commit subcommittee your invol
 
05:26:58.788 --> 05:26:58.798 align:start position:0%
your work in in this role um I have
 
05:27:01.310 --> 05:27:01.320 align:start position:0%
worked for the division now for six
 
05:27:03.590 --> 05:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
years first five years was as an
 
05:27:03.600 --> 05:27:04.708 align:start position:0%
years first five years was as an
independent

05:27:04.708 --> 05:27:04.718 align:start position:0%
independent
 
05:27:08.150 --> 05:27:08.160 align:start position:0%
consultant and the last year plus has
 
05:27:11.070 --> 05:27:11.080 align:start position:0%
been as an actual full-time employee um
 
05:27:13.470 --> 05:27:13.480 align:start position:0%
initially starting out as a mortality
 
05:27:16.670 --> 05:27:16.680 align:start position:0%
surveillance agent I was brought on to
 
05:27:21.270 --> 05:27:21.280 align:start position:0%
register train and educate both Funeral
 
05:27:24.548 --> 05:27:24.558 align:start position:0%
Directors doctors nurses hospitals
 
05:27:27.150 --> 05:27:27.160 align:start position:0%
funeral homes Etc on the use of the
 
05:27:30.070 --> 05:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
system um this last year has been a
 
05:27:32.110 --> 05:27:32.120 align:start position:0%
little bit more broadened in scope but I
 
05:27:35.230 --> 05:27:35.240 align:start position:0%
still handle all of the registrations
 
05:27:38.230 --> 05:27:38.240 align:start position:0%
for or most of the registrations for new
 
05:27:40.190 --> 05:27:40.200 align:start position:0%
users applying for application the
 
05:27:42.948 --> 05:27:42.958 align:start position:0%
vetting of those applicants and the
 
05:27:46.190 --> 05:27:46.200 align:start position:0%
registration process of them um I also
 
05:27:50.830 --> 05:27:50.840 align:start position:0%
work closely with our team to help
 
05:27:53.948 --> 05:27:53.958 align:start position:0%
um when we do any redesigns of any of
 
05:27:57.270 --> 05:27:57.280 align:start position:0%
our modules and what needs to be changed
 
05:28:01.150 --> 05:28:01.160 align:start position:0%
within the modules um I troubleshoot
 
05:28:04.670 --> 05:28:04.680 align:start position:0%
problems from calls that come in uh so
 
05:28:10.750 --> 05:28:10.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:13.868 --> 05:28:13.878 align:start position:0%
division Ro
 
05:28:18.670 --> 05:28:18.680 align:start position:0%
Schmid thank you madam chair so as you
 
05:28:23.030 --> 05:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
know we've been in this trench
 
05:28:27.830 --> 05:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
before uh and and and we've had
 
05:28:30.788 --> 05:28:30.798 align:start position:0%
considerable problems with conflicting
 
05:28:32.868 --> 05:28:32.878 align:start position:0%
interests there are the interests of
 
05:28:34.430 --> 05:28:34.440 align:start position:0%
citizens in
 
05:28:38.110 --> 05:28:38.120 align:start position:0%
privacy um but there are also certain
 
05:28:41.350 --> 05:28:41.360 align:start position:0%
medical aspects in which uh
 
05:28:41.360 --> 05:28:43.230 align:start position:0%
medical aspects in which uh
identification

05:28:43.230 --> 05:28:43.240 align:start position:0%
identification
 
05:28:46.788 --> 05:28:46.798 align:start position:0%
of children with early health problems
 
05:28:50.230 --> 05:28:50.240 align:start position:0%
where immediate treatment is vital for
 
05:28:52.510 --> 05:28:52.520 align:start position:0%
these children
 
05:28:55.390 --> 05:28:55.400 align:start position:0%
represent this is the Secretary of
 
05:28:56.788 --> 05:28:56.798 align:start position:0%
State's office I think the question that
 
05:28:59.628 --> 05:28:59.638 align:start position:0%
you want to ask is for HHS so can you
 
05:29:02.270 --> 05:29:02.280 align:start position:0%
just wait for that well but I have to
 
05:29:04.310 --> 05:29:04.320 align:start position:0%
frame it to to these people as well
 
05:29:06.430 --> 05:29:06.440 align:start position:0%
because they're the ones that that are
 
05:29:11.190 --> 05:29:11.200 align:start position:0%
in control of the creation uh the usage
 
05:29:12.150 --> 05:29:12.160 align:start position:0%
and the
 
05:29:15.708 --> 05:29:15.718 align:start position:0%
maintenance uh of the record system um
 
05:29:18.708 --> 05:29:18.718 align:start position:0%
and to the degree that they are uh doing
 
05:29:22.270 --> 05:29:22.280 align:start position:0%
something which is helping the one side
 
05:29:26.310 --> 05:29:26.320 align:start position:0%
and hurting the other side go ahead so
 
05:29:28.990 --> 05:29:29.000 align:start position:0%
uh if you're dealing with especially
 
05:29:34.310 --> 05:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
with a a a newborn okay you have to know
 
05:29:37.030 --> 05:29:37.040 align:start position:0%
who the parent is and you have to be
 
05:29:41.470 --> 05:29:41.480 align:start position:0%
able to identify the medical emergency
 
05:29:44.390 --> 05:29:44.400 align:start position:0%
that arises in some cases I think it's a
 
05:29:47.590 --> 05:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
relatively small number of uh percentage
 
05:29:49.190 --> 05:29:49.200 align:start position:0%
but you have children who must be
 
05:29:52.270 --> 05:29:52.280 align:start position:0%
treated in very short order or they are
 
05:29:57.230 --> 05:29:57.240 align:start position:0%
going to be uh lifelong sufferers from
 
05:30:01.390 --> 05:30:01.400 align:start position:0%
the some some kind of an illness uh that
 
05:30:03.230 --> 05:30:03.240 align:start position:0%
that could have been prevented had they
 
05:30:05.510 --> 05:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
been treated immediately and if they're
 
05:30:07.750 --> 05:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
not they they're going to suffer a
 
05:30:11.350 --> 05:30:11.360 align:start position:0%
lifelong disability and we had people
 
05:30:14.350 --> 05:30:14.360 align:start position:0%
the last time around talking about and I
 
05:30:16.510 --> 05:30:16.520 align:start position:0%
met some of the parents who were here
 
05:30:18.910 --> 05:30:18.920 align:start position:0%
with their children who had not been
 
05:30:22.070 --> 05:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
recognized early enough because Med
 
05:30:25.310 --> 05:30:25.320 align:start position:0%
medical science was not there yet and
 
05:30:26.910 --> 05:30:26.920 align:start position:0%
therefore they were not
 
05:30:30.390 --> 05:30:30.400 align:start position:0%
treated um and so that's one one of the
 
05:30:32.510 --> 05:30:32.520 align:start position:0%
things I'm very concerned about and is
 
05:30:35.948 --> 05:30:35.958 align:start position:0%
there is there a way of of having a
 
05:30:38.548 --> 05:30:38.558 align:start position:0%
record package if you will that
 
05:30:42.788 --> 05:30:42.798 align:start position:0%
initially has all the data in terms of
 
05:30:46.190 --> 05:30:46.200 align:start position:0%
name address contact information and so
 
05:30:49.750 --> 05:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
forth tying mother and child together
 
05:30:51.390 --> 05:30:51.400 align:start position:0%
and if that child is one of those that
 
05:30:53.350 --> 05:30:53.360 align:start position:0%
needs immediate treatment that they're
 
05:30:54.390 --> 05:30:54.400 align:start position:0%
going to get
 
05:30:57.750 --> 05:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
it but at some point the form can be
 
05:31:00.788 --> 05:31:00.798 align:start position:0%
pulled apart so that some of the crucial
 
05:31:03.788 --> 05:31:03.798 align:start position:0%
information that is needed at the
 
05:31:07.590 --> 05:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
beginning uh serves that purpose and
 
05:31:10.670 --> 05:31:10.680 align:start position:0%
then when the form is pulled apart in my
 
05:31:14.788 --> 05:31:14.798 align:start position:0%
concept pulled apart then it's no longer
 
05:31:17.788 --> 05:31:17.798 align:start position:0%
a is not connected to be anymore and you
 
05:31:20.788 --> 05:31:20.798 align:start position:0%
and the that person's privacy and so
 
05:31:24.948 --> 05:31:24.958 align:start position:0%
forth is there protected but you you get
 
05:31:27.430 --> 05:31:27.440 align:start position:0%
the medical benefit is there some way
 
05:31:30.230 --> 05:31:30.240 align:start position:0%
that your forms are currently designed
 
05:31:34.750 --> 05:31:34.760 align:start position:0%
or could be designed uh to to to achieve
 
05:31:36.830 --> 05:31:36.840 align:start position:0%
what I've been talking about because
 
05:31:39.830 --> 05:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
you're the ones that can that well to
 
05:31:42.150 --> 05:31:42.160 align:start position:0%
some degree the forms are under your
 
05:31:43.830 --> 05:31:43.840 align:start position:0%
control but I think some of the forms
 
05:31:46.788 --> 05:31:46.798 align:start position:0%
are also generated and dictated by the
 
05:31:49.470 --> 05:31:49.480 align:start position:0%
federal government right it's federal
 
05:31:52.548 --> 05:31:52.558 align:start position:0%
law so you C you can't disregard that
 
05:31:54.948 --> 05:31:54.958 align:start position:0%
without getting in considerable
 
05:31:57.590 --> 05:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
difficulty from that respect so can you
 
05:32:00.390 --> 05:32:00.400 align:start position:0%
speak to that um I will try to answer
 
05:32:02.470 --> 05:32:02.480 align:start position:0%
your question on that so uh the way the
 
05:32:03.990 --> 05:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
form is designed does follow the
 
05:32:06.510 --> 05:32:06.520 align:start position:0%
National Standard for what um the
 
05:32:07.670 --> 05:32:07.680 align:start position:0%
federal government is saying we should
 
05:32:09.310 --> 05:32:09.320 align:start position:0%
be collecting for information that is
 
05:32:10.990 --> 05:32:11.000 align:start position:0%
both on the demographic piece that we're
 
05:32:12.230 --> 05:32:12.240 align:start position:0%
collecting to create the birth
 
05:32:14.030 --> 05:32:14.040 align:start position:0%
certificate itself and also on the
 
05:32:15.708 --> 05:32:15.718 align:start position:0%
statistical piece that is used for
 
05:32:18.548 --> 05:32:18.558 align:start position:0%
public health um currently the form has
 
05:32:21.510 --> 05:32:21.520 align:start position:0%
it all collected together and it is put
 
05:32:24.948 --> 05:32:24.958 align:start position:0%
into our Nan database together so when
 
05:32:29.070 --> 05:32:29.080 align:start position:0%
it goes to DHHS right now it is going as
 
05:32:32.270 --> 05:32:32.280 align:start position:0%
one de data set it's not being separated
 
05:32:34.510 --> 05:32:34.520 align:start position:0%
out they're separating out their data on
 
05:32:36.628 --> 05:32:36.638 align:start position:0%
their end for anybody who has access to
 
05:32:38.110 --> 05:32:38.120 align:start position:0%
it which they can speak to that there's
 
05:32:40.548 --> 05:32:40.558 align:start position:0%
very similarly structured to us where
 
05:32:43.390 --> 05:32:43.400 align:start position:0%
they have um access granted only certain
 
05:32:46.430 --> 05:32:46.440 align:start position:0%
people and then again we're focusing on
 
05:32:48.910 --> 05:32:48.920 align:start position:0%
data quality and on the birth
 
05:32:52.230 --> 05:32:52.240 align:start position:0%
certificate that all facilitates the the
 
05:32:55.030 --> 05:32:55.040 align:start position:0%
the ability to perform these vital
 
05:32:58.788 --> 05:32:58.798 align:start position:0%
medical uh testing and and potentially
 
05:33:01.070 --> 05:33:01.080 align:start position:0%
treatment operation
 
05:33:04.070 --> 05:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
where they are needed uh at at at the
 
05:33:05.750 --> 05:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
time they are needed that correct that
 
05:33:07.270 --> 05:33:07.280 align:start position:0%
is well that's something you probably
 
05:33:10.390 --> 05:33:10.400 align:start position:0%
want to ask I will ask them we're going
 
05:33:13.910 --> 05:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
to have this handled by HHS I'd like to
 
05:33:16.670 --> 05:33:16.680 align:start position:0%
have thank you very much I'd like um and
 
05:33:18.708 --> 05:33:18.718 align:start position:0%
Mr Kirk if you could kindly come forth
 
05:33:21.670 --> 05:33:21.680 align:start position:0%
and express your concerns with this
 
05:33:23.470 --> 05:33:23.480 align:start position:0%
legislation or the passage of this
 
05:33:25.868 --> 05:33:25.878 align:start position:0%
legislation and representative Bolton if
 
05:33:28.708 --> 05:33:28.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:32.270 --> 05:33:32.280 align:start position:0%
too did did Mr Kirk hear
 
05:33:32.280 --> 05:33:43.390 align:start position:0%
too did did Mr Kirk hear
me

05:33:43.390 --> 05:33:43.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:43.400 --> 05:33:45.030 align:start position:0%
 
y

05:33:45.030 --> 05:33:45.040 align:start position:0%
y
 
05:33:49.070 --> 05:33:49.080 align:start position:0%
right actually um I was going to defer U
 
05:33:49.080 --> 05:33:49.868 align:start position:0%
right actually um I was going to defer U
uh

05:33:49.868 --> 05:33:49.878 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:33:52.548 --> 05:33:52.558 align:start position:0%
honorable Kirk but I've got a question
 
05:33:55.788 --> 05:33:55.798 align:start position:0%
just about the um the way this bill is
 
05:33:57.670 --> 05:33:57.680 align:start position:0%
going to be handled in committee I know
 
05:34:00.788 --> 05:34:00.798 align:start position:0%
it's an early Bill and um um I guess
 
05:34:02.350 --> 05:34:02.360 align:start position:0%
some of the Committees are looking at
 
05:34:04.470 --> 05:34:04.480 align:start position:0%
February 15th before they have to get
 
05:34:07.310 --> 05:34:07.320 align:start position:0%
the bills out or for your information
 
05:34:09.670 --> 05:34:09.680 align:start position:0%
the deadline for this committee to
 
05:34:13.070 --> 05:34:13.080 align:start position:0%
report out the bill is February 15th
 
05:34:14.910 --> 05:34:14.920 align:start position:0%
okay I have scheduled an executive
 
05:34:17.590 --> 05:34:17.600 align:start position:0%
session for February 7th which will
 
05:34:20.430 --> 05:34:20.440 align:start position:0%
allow us time to get an amendment if or
 
05:34:22.948 --> 05:34:22.958 align:start position:0%
some or you know we we'll get most of
 
05:34:24.750 --> 05:34:24.760 align:start position:0%
our bills out then we could delay a
 
05:34:27.788 --> 05:34:27.798 align:start position:0%
little bit but okay we're up against a
 
05:34:31.390 --> 05:34:31.400 align:start position:0%
deadline thank you thank you
 
05:34:31.400 --> 05:34:35.390 align:start position:0%
deadline thank you thank you
go

05:34:35.390 --> 05:34:35.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:38.670 --> 05:34:38.680 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you madam chairman for uh
 
05:34:41.628 --> 05:34:41.638 align:start position:0%
allowing me to speak
 
05:34:46.230 --> 05:34:46.240 align:start position:0%
um this bill is is one of many which
 
05:34:47.788 --> 05:34:47.798 align:start position:0%
have been and will be introduced over
 
05:34:50.830 --> 05:34:50.840 align:start position:0%
the next few years in order to bring the
 
05:34:52.948 --> 05:34:52.958 align:start position:0%
state into compliance with the
 
05:34:54.830 --> 05:34:54.840 align:start position:0%
Constitutional privacy Amendment which
 
05:34:56.628 --> 05:34:56.638 align:start position:0%
passed in
 
05:35:01.310 --> 05:35:01.320 align:start position:0%
2018 um that Amendment basically um
 
05:35:04.910 --> 05:35:04.920 align:start position:0%
requires or forbids the state agencies
 
05:35:06.750 --> 05:35:06.760 align:start position:0%
or the state to have access to
 
05:35:08.628 --> 05:35:08.638 align:start position:0%
personally identifiable information
 
05:35:12.030 --> 05:35:12.040 align:start position:0%
except under uh extraordinary
 
05:35:13.830 --> 05:35:13.840 align:start position:0%
circumstances this
 
05:35:16.510 --> 05:35:16.520 align:start position:0%
bill primarily is saying that with
 
05:35:20.948 --> 05:35:20.958 align:start position:0%
respect to certain Vital Records um
 
05:35:22.830 --> 05:35:22.840 align:start position:0%
statistical data about them will go to
 
05:35:24.310 --> 05:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
the Departments but no personal
 
05:35:26.390 --> 05:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
information but personal information
 
05:35:29.230 --> 05:35:29.240 align:start position:0%
will be retained by uh the Secretary of
 
05:35:31.350 --> 05:35:31.360 align:start position:0%
State's office vital records and will
 
05:35:34.190 --> 05:35:34.200 align:start position:0%
not be shared this bill doesn't address
 
05:35:36.788 --> 05:35:36.798 align:start position:0%
the issue of whether the state
 
05:35:38.830 --> 05:35:38.840 align:start position:0%
Department's acquisition of that
 
05:35:41.070 --> 05:35:41.080 align:start position:0%
information is constitutional or not
 
05:35:42.670 --> 05:35:42.680 align:start position:0%
that's a separate question for another
 
05:35:44.948 --> 05:35:44.958 align:start position:0%
day the question this bill addresses is
 
05:35:47.310 --> 05:35:47.320 align:start position:0%
information sharing what information
 
05:35:51.110 --> 05:35:51.120 align:start position:0%
that agency that one agency Vital
 
05:35:54.030 --> 05:35:54.040 align:start position:0%
Records gets uh can be shared with other
 
05:35:56.670 --> 05:35:56.680 align:start position:0%
agencies in the state where its
 
05:35:58.708 --> 05:35:58.718 align:start position:0%
personally identifiable information is
 
05:36:00.830 --> 05:36:00.840 align:start position:0%
involved if it's plain statistical
 
05:36:02.590 --> 05:36:02.600 align:start position:0%
information this bill really doesn't
 
05:36:04.510 --> 05:36:04.520 align:start position:0%
relate to that it just bars the
 
05:36:07.230 --> 05:36:07.240 align:start position:0%
transmission of personally identifiable
 
05:36:11.110 --> 05:36:11.120 align:start position:0%
information from Vital Records to others
 
05:36:13.670 --> 05:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
um the registar and she just
 
05:36:17.910 --> 05:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
testified uh wrote a I thought rather
 
05:36:21.070 --> 05:36:21.080 align:start position:0%
compelling brief that explained how
 
05:36:23.948 --> 05:36:23.958 align:start position:0%
complex this area is and how
 
05:36:26.310 --> 05:36:26.320 align:start position:0%
intertwined the various sections of
 
05:36:28.830 --> 05:36:28.840 align:start position:0%
current law is and how some of the
 
05:36:31.030 --> 05:36:31.040 align:start position:0%
provisions of this Bill left unanswered
 
05:36:33.390 --> 05:36:33.400 align:start position:0%
questions for her as to how she was to
 
05:36:36.030 --> 05:36:36.040 align:start position:0%
administer the law should this bill pass
 
05:36:37.230 --> 05:36:37.240 align:start position:0%
and whether or not there were some
 
05:36:39.230 --> 05:36:39.240 align:start position:0%
conflicts between what this bill was
 
05:36:41.590 --> 05:36:41.600 align:start position:0%
doing and what current law
 
05:36:41.600 --> 05:36:44.030 align:start position:0%
doing and what current law
was

05:36:44.030 --> 05:36:44.040 align:start position:0%
was
 
05:36:47.390 --> 05:36:47.400 align:start position:0%
um because it's such a complex area uh I
 
05:36:48.708 --> 05:36:48.718 align:start position:0%
know that if I were sitting on this
 
05:36:50.190 --> 05:36:50.200 align:start position:0%
subcommittee I would not be able to
 
05:36:52.910 --> 05:36:52.920 align:start position:0%
address it in any reasonable time frame
 
05:36:55.750 --> 05:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
so I'd like to offer a suggestion that
 
05:36:59.868 --> 05:36:59.878 align:start position:0%
works with the Chairman's time frame and
 
05:37:02.070 --> 05:37:02.080 align:start position:0%
might be a a reasonable way to get the
 
05:37:03.830 --> 05:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
best possible result in the shortest
 
05:37:05.350 --> 05:37:05.360 align:start position:0%
period of
 
05:37:05.360 --> 05:37:07.190 align:start position:0%
period of
time

05:37:07.190 --> 05:37:07.200 align:start position:0%
time
 
05:37:09.910 --> 05:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
um before I do that I just like to make
 
05:37:11.708 --> 05:37:11.718 align:start position:0%
one OBS one General observation which
 
05:37:14.070 --> 05:37:14.080 align:start position:0%
folks need I hope will keep in
 
05:37:16.708 --> 05:37:16.718 align:start position:0%
mind a lot of the testimony on privacy
 
05:37:19.310 --> 05:37:19.320 align:start position:0%
bills that I've heard today 484 in the
 
05:37:21.750 --> 05:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
Senate and this bill when it was
 
05:37:24.390 --> 05:37:24.400 align:start position:0%
originally uh coming before the
 
05:37:24.400 --> 05:37:27.310 align:start position:0%
originally uh coming before the
committee

05:37:27.310 --> 05:37:27.320 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:37:30.350 --> 05:37:30.360 align:start position:0%
um focused a lot on how how well state
 
05:37:32.830 --> 05:37:32.840 align:start position:0%
agencies did in protecting personal
 
05:37:35.270 --> 05:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
information from people who weren't
 
05:37:37.910 --> 05:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
supposed to have access to it that's not
 
05:37:39.590 --> 05:37:39.600 align:start position:0%
what this bill is
 
05:37:42.628 --> 05:37:42.638 align:start position:0%
about the real question is what
 
05:37:44.350 --> 05:37:44.360 align:start position:0%
information should this personal
 
05:37:46.150 --> 05:37:46.160 align:start position:0%
information should the state be able to
 
05:37:49.190 --> 05:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
get and keep in the first
 
05:37:51.310 --> 05:37:51.320 align:start position:0%
place not a question of what they do
 
05:37:52.990 --> 05:37:53.000 align:start position:0%
with the information when they get it
 
05:37:54.390 --> 05:37:54.400 align:start position:0%
it's a question of what personally
 
05:37:56.350 --> 05:37:56.360 align:start position:0%
identifiable information under the
 
05:37:58.990 --> 05:37:59.000 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Amendment the state is
 
05:37:59.000 --> 05:38:01.750 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Amendment the state is
allowed

05:38:01.750 --> 05:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:05.190 --> 05:38:05.200 align:start position:0%
get this bill says in effect whatever
 
05:38:07.548 --> 05:38:07.558 align:start position:0%
Vital Records can get it can't share
 
05:38:08.948 --> 05:38:08.958 align:start position:0%
personally identifiable part the
 
05:38:11.510 --> 05:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
statistical part it can share so here's
 
05:38:14.910 --> 05:38:14.920 align:start position:0%
my suggestion to to try to work this
 
05:38:19.110 --> 05:38:19.120 align:start position:0%
out establish a working group um headed
 
05:38:21.590 --> 05:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
by with the sponsor and and two members
 
05:38:23.230 --> 05:38:23.240 align:start position:0%
from this committee a Republican and a
 
05:38:27.110 --> 05:38:27.120 align:start position:0%
Democrat to work with the registar and
 
05:38:29.750 --> 05:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
produce by next what's today Wednesday
 
05:38:32.788 --> 05:38:32.798 align:start position:0%
by next Wednesday a working draft it
 
05:38:34.788 --> 05:38:34.798 align:start position:0%
would largely be written by the
 
05:38:37.788 --> 05:38:37.798 align:start position:0%
registar with the legislators involved
 
05:38:41.190 --> 05:38:41.200 align:start position:0%
making sure that her draft complied with
 
05:38:44.230 --> 05:38:44.240 align:start position:0%
the principles that I'm going to suggest
 
05:38:44.240 --> 05:38:45.788 align:start position:0%
the principles that I'm going to suggest
be

05:38:45.788 --> 05:38:45.798 align:start position:0%
be
 
05:38:47.868 --> 05:38:47.878 align:start position:0%
incorporated if if that approach were
 
05:38:50.350 --> 05:38:50.360 align:start position:0%
followed it would be possible for the
 
05:38:52.910 --> 05:38:52.920 align:start position:0%
committee to be assured that whatever
 
05:38:55.430 --> 05:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
came out uh met whatever standards it
 
05:38:57.868 --> 05:38:57.878 align:start position:0%
had um without themselves becoming
 
05:39:00.070 --> 05:39:00.080 align:start position:0%
expert in the minutia of these very
 
05:39:03.030 --> 05:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
complicated intertwined
 
05:39:07.110 --> 05:39:07.120 align:start position:0%
sections the principles that I would um
 
05:39:09.910 --> 05:39:09.920 align:start position:0%
suggest guide this group and indeed if
 
05:39:12.468 --> 05:39:12.478 align:start position:0%
you don't establish this group guide the
 
05:39:17.590 --> 05:39:17.600 align:start position:0%
subcommittee is that number one a no um
 
05:39:17.600 --> 05:39:18.670 align:start position:0%
subcommittee is that number one a no um
personally

05:39:18.670 --> 05:39:18.680 align:start position:0%
personally
 
05:39:18.680 --> 05:39:20.430 align:start position:0%
personally
identifiable

05:39:20.430 --> 05:39:20.440 align:start position:0%
identifiable
 
05:39:22.788 --> 05:39:22.798 align:start position:0%
information that vital records has
 
05:39:24.468 --> 05:39:24.478 align:start position:0%
should be shared with any other state
 
05:39:26.270 --> 05:39:26.280 align:start position:0%
agency Health and Human
 
05:39:28.948 --> 05:39:28.958 align:start position:0%
Services um Corrections the retirement
 
05:39:28.958 --> 05:39:33.030 align:start position:0%

05:39:37.030 --> 05:39:37.040 align:start position:0%
um number two B that no
 
05:39:39.110 --> 05:39:39.120 align:start position:0%
personally that's hospitals let's leave
 
05:39:43.230 --> 05:39:43.240 align:start position:0%
that aside um third that informed
 
05:39:46.788 --> 05:39:46.798 align:start position:0%

identifiable information in other words
 
05:39:55.910 --> 05:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
the person involved needs to agree yes
 
05:39:57.430 --> 05:39:57.440 align:start position:0%
the state may have this information
 
05:39:58.990 --> 05:39:59.000 align:start position:0%
personally identifiable information
 
05:39:59.000 --> 05:40:01.590 align:start position:0%
personally identifiable information
about

05:40:01.590 --> 05:40:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:04.150 --> 05:40:04.160 align:start position:0%
C that any access to personally
 
05:40:05.948 --> 05:40:05.958 align:start position:0%
identifiable information by a state
 
05:40:08.230 --> 05:40:08.240 align:start position:0%
department is on a caseby Case basis in
 
05:40:09.390 --> 05:40:09.400 align:start position:0%
other words they don't get the whole
 
05:40:11.590 --> 05:40:11.600 align:start position:0%
data set but they get whatever they need
 
05:40:13.230 --> 05:40:13.240 align:start position:0%
in a particular case to deal with a
 
05:40:15.708 --> 05:40:15.718 align:start position:0%
particular individual again with that
 
05:40:15.718 --> 05:40:18.430 align:start position:0%
particular individual again with that
individual's

05:40:18.430 --> 05:40:18.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:18.440 --> 05:40:20.510 align:start position:0%
 
consent

05:40:20.510 --> 05:40:20.520 align:start position:0%
consent
 
05:40:22.708 --> 05:40:22.718 align:start position:0%
um finally an
 
05:40:26.310 --> 05:40:26.320 align:start position:0%
observation um this bill has financial
 
05:40:30.590 --> 05:40:30.600 align:start position:0%
implications and it's an FN uh
 
05:40:32.230 --> 05:40:32.240 align:start position:0%
the department has in other cases and
 
05:40:34.708 --> 05:40:34.718 align:start position:0%
I'm sure they would he explain why we
 
05:40:36.910 --> 05:40:36.920 align:start position:0%
will lose all sorts of federal revenue
 
05:40:39.708 --> 05:40:39.718 align:start position:0%
if this bill goes forward um my
 
05:40:42.310 --> 05:40:42.320 align:start position:0%
suggestion to the committee is that to
 
05:40:44.468 --> 05:40:44.478 align:start position:0%
focus on the PRI the policy aspects of
 
05:40:47.110 --> 05:40:47.120 align:start position:0%
this and leave the questions of finances
 
05:40:49.990 --> 05:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
and loss of federal revenue to the
 
05:40:52.310 --> 05:40:52.320 align:start position:0%
finance committee this is an FN bill and
 
05:40:53.788 --> 05:40:53.798 align:start position:0%
I suspect the finance committee will
 
05:40:56.708 --> 05:40:56.718 align:start position:0%
take it division 3 will look at this and
 
05:40:58.788 --> 05:40:58.798 align:start position:0%
get information not just from Health and
 
05:41:00.390 --> 05:41:00.400 align:start position:0%
Human Service serves our department but
 
05:41:02.510 --> 05:41:02.520 align:start position:0%
from the federal departments to confirm
 
05:41:04.310 --> 05:41:04.320 align:start position:0%
in fact if there will be a loss of
 
05:41:06.548 --> 05:41:06.558 align:start position:0%
Revenue if certain information that
 
05:41:08.868 --> 05:41:08.878 align:start position:0%
traditionally has been passed on will
 
05:41:11.310 --> 05:41:11.320 align:start position:0%
will not be passed on in the future so
 
05:41:14.310 --> 05:41:14.320 align:start position:0%
those three principles would enable this
 
05:41:16.110 --> 05:41:16.120 align:start position:0%
working group to come up with a bill
 
05:41:17.990 --> 05:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
which then the committee as a policy
 
05:41:19.990 --> 05:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
matter could make an informed decision
 
05:41:22.430 --> 05:41:22.440 align:start position:0%
on thank you madam
 
05:41:25.430 --> 05:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
chairman you your time and thank you for
 
05:41:30.948 --> 05:41:30.958 align:start position:0%
your um your breakdown on on your um
 
05:41:37.110 --> 05:41:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:41.628 --> 05:41:41.638 align:start position:0%
Kirk so Neil have you provided the
 
05:41:45.310 --> 05:41:45.320 align:start position:0%
details of the the points that you were
 
05:41:47.788 --> 05:41:47.798 align:start position:0%
just enunciating you already provided
 
05:41:49.390 --> 05:41:49.400 align:start position:0%
that inwriting
 
05:41:52.390 --> 05:41:52.400 align:start position:0%
to uh the appropriate
 
05:41:55.510 --> 05:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
departments no this is the very first
 
05:41:57.230 --> 05:41:57.240 align:start position:0%
opportunity I've had to do this and I
 
05:41:59.830 --> 05:41:59.840 align:start position:0%
thought it's not my position to do that
 
05:42:01.350 --> 05:42:01.360 align:start position:0%
it's a question for the subcommittee as
 
05:42:04.030 --> 05:42:04.040 align:start position:0%
to what they want to do my proposal is
 
05:42:05.190 --> 05:42:05.200 align:start position:0%
just a
 
05:42:07.350 --> 05:42:07.360 align:start position:0%
suggestion and it involves two things
 
05:42:09.868 --> 05:42:09.878 align:start position:0%
one how do we get how do you folks get
 
05:42:12.350 --> 05:42:12.360 align:start position:0%
past a very complicated area in a very
 
05:42:15.230 --> 05:42:15.240 align:start position:0%
short period of time and B what
 
05:42:17.510 --> 05:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
principles what policy directives do you
 
05:42:18.750 --> 05:42:18.760 align:start position:0%
want to give the folks who are going to
 
05:42:21.390 --> 05:42:21.400 align:start position:0%
do this work I suggested the three that
 
05:42:23.070 --> 05:42:23.080 align:start position:0%
I would give them but obviously you
 
05:42:25.390 --> 05:42:25.400 align:start position:0%
folks could give them those others
 
05:42:27.390 --> 05:42:27.400 align:start position:0%
whatever you wanted to do so nope
 
05:42:29.310 --> 05:42:29.320 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt I have not spoken
 
05:42:31.270 --> 05:42:31.280 align:start position:0%
to anyone except this committee and
 
05:42:34.430 --> 05:42:34.440 align:start position:0%
representative Bolton about this I I
 
05:42:36.430 --> 05:42:36.440 align:start position:0%
took diligent notes because I think it's
 
05:42:38.468 --> 05:42:38.478 align:start position:0%
very important obviously your years of
 
05:42:41.830 --> 05:42:41.840 align:start position:0%
experience should not be you know left
 
05:42:45.708 --> 05:42:45.718 align:start position:0%
aside for foolishness like the fact that
 
05:42:48.590 --> 05:42:48.600 align:start position:0%
you're no longer in office uh you you're
 
05:42:51.708 --> 05:42:51.718 align:start position:0%
still very much up on all these issues
 
05:42:54.548 --> 05:42:54.558 align:start position:0%
and I I'd like to make sure that we that
 
05:42:58.830 --> 05:42:58.840 align:start position:0%
we make this this proposed solution as
 
05:43:01.110 --> 05:43:01.120 align:start position:0%
per perfect as possible even if we don't
 
05:43:04.230 --> 05:43:04.240 align:start position:0%
get it to perfect I share your concern
 
05:43:04.240 --> 05:43:04.948 align:start position:0%
get it to perfect I share your concern
thank

05:43:04.948 --> 05:43:04.958 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:43:08.788 --> 05:43:08.798 align:start position:0%
you thank you um I'd like to call Trish
 
05:43:11.910 --> 05:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
Chile to the uh the
 
05:43:15.510 --> 05:43:15.520 align:start position:0%
table and what I've asked um AJ chess to
 
05:43:18.270 --> 05:43:18.280 align:start position:0%
do is to review with the
 
05:43:20.868 --> 05:43:20.878 align:start position:0%
subcommittee the
 
05:43:20.878 --> 05:43:22.830 align:start position:0%
subcommittee the
um

05:43:22.830 --> 05:43:22.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:43:25.590 --> 05:43:25.600 align:start position:0%
invol the loss the financial loss of
 
05:43:27.548 --> 05:43:27.558 align:start position:0%
funding per
 
05:43:30.430 --> 05:43:30.440 align:start position:0%
the per the subgroup of people that are
 
05:43:31.830 --> 05:43:31.840 align:start position:0%
involved I thought it would be helpful
 
05:43:36.110 --> 05:43:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:39.070 --> 05:43:39.080 align:start position:0%
that representative per Kirk said this
 
05:43:41.830 --> 05:43:41.840 align:start position:0%
is going to go to finance we don't
 
05:43:44.750 --> 05:43:44.760 align:start position:0%
really need to go into great detail on
 
05:43:47.230 --> 05:43:47.240 align:start position:0%
the finance in my opinion but your
 
05:43:51.230 --> 05:43:51.240 align:start position:0%
committee right I I'm sorry I we're
 
05:43:52.910 --> 05:43:52.920 align:start position:0%
happy to do whatever the committee would
 
05:43:55.390 --> 05:43:55.400 align:start position:0%
like us to do well if you can do it in
 
05:43:57.070 --> 05:43:57.080 align:start position:0%
the next like 10 minutes that would be
 
05:43:59.830 --> 05:43:59.840 align:start position:0%
great great um so again thank you so
 
05:44:01.468 --> 05:44:01.478 align:start position:0%
much for having me my name is Patricia
 
05:44:03.150 --> 05:44:03.160 align:start position:0%
Tilly I am an associate commissioner at
 
05:44:04.270 --> 05:44:04.280 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
05:44:06.670 --> 05:44:06.680 align:start position:0%
Services and I had the pleasure of
 
05:44:08.750 --> 05:44:08.760 align:start position:0%
speaking with you earlier about this
 
05:44:14.150 --> 05:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
bill um we all understand um that 1689
 
05:44:16.670 --> 05:44:16.680 align:start position:0%
has far-reaching consequences impacting
 
05:44:19.310 --> 05:44:19.320 align:start position:0%
needed Health Services economic supports
 
05:44:21.750 --> 05:44:21.760 align:start position:0%
and fraud prevention for New Hampshire
 
05:44:23.708 --> 05:44:23.718 align:start position:0%
residents understandably there was a
 
05:44:25.708 --> 05:44:25.718 align:start position:0%
tsunami of information the last time
 
05:44:27.670 --> 05:44:27.680 align:start position:0%
that we were here and at the direction
 
05:44:29.390 --> 05:44:29.400 align:start position:0%
of the committee we are happy to walk
 
05:44:31.548 --> 05:44:31.558 align:start position:0%
through quickly several examples where
 
05:44:33.468 --> 05:44:33.478 align:start position:0%
the department uses our direct and
 
05:44:35.430 --> 05:44:35.440 align:start position:0%
tangible interest to assist New
 
05:44:37.750 --> 05:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents and the financial
 
05:44:39.310 --> 05:44:39.320 align:start position:0%
impact if those Services were not
 
05:44:41.070 --> 05:44:41.080 align:start position:0%
available we will do that quickly you
 
05:44:44.030 --> 05:44:44.040 align:start position:0%
can you know get the gong show U hook on
 
05:44:47.510 --> 05:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
us as as you would like um we also want
 
05:44:49.270 --> 05:44:49.280 align:start position:0%
to just I want to suggest right in the
 
05:44:51.150 --> 05:44:51.160 align:start position:0%
beginning that we're all here to provide
 
05:44:54.150 --> 05:44:54.160 align:start position:0%
input on this policy discussion about
 
05:44:56.230 --> 05:44:56.240 align:start position:0%
balancing New Hampshire's intrinsic
 
05:44:59.750 --> 05:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
belief in privacy with the need of
 
05:45:01.868 --> 05:45:01.878 align:start position:0%
government's efficient effective and
 
05:45:04.670 --> 05:45:04.680 align:start position:0%
necessary flow of information to provide
 
05:45:06.230 --> 05:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
those Essential Health and Social
 
05:45:08.628 --> 05:45:08.638 align:start position:0%
Services for New Hampshire's infants and
 
05:45:11.350 --> 05:45:11.360 align:start position:0%
mothers in particular for this dead this
 
05:45:14.310 --> 05:45:14.320 align:start position:0%
is a balance um you know I always Le
 
05:45:16.750 --> 05:45:16.760 align:start position:0%
learn from former representative Kirk he
 
05:45:18.070 --> 05:45:18.080 align:start position:0%
has kept me on the straight and narrow
 
05:45:20.150 --> 05:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
for many years but I know that this
 
05:45:21.590 --> 05:45:21.600 align:start position:0%
committee is going to be considering
 
05:45:23.230 --> 05:45:23.240 align:start position:0%
these things so there are four broad
 
05:45:24.948 --> 05:45:24.958 align:start position:0%
areas for us to consider there's the
 
05:45:27.350 --> 05:45:27.360 align:start position:0%
public health aspects of what it would
 
05:45:28.990 --> 05:45:29.000 align:start position:0%
mean for the Department of Health and
 
05:45:32.110 --> 05:45:32.120 align:start position:0%
Human Services to not have both um the
 
05:45:35.270 --> 05:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
identifier the name of the individual as
 
05:45:37.510 --> 05:45:37.520 align:start position:0%
well as the medical information that we
 
05:45:39.830 --> 05:45:39.840 align:start position:0%
learned is on the back end of the the
 
05:45:42.150 --> 05:45:42.160 align:start position:0%
birth certificate we need to talk about
 
05:45:44.910 --> 05:45:44.920 align:start position:0%
the legitimate investigations of fraud
 
05:45:48.150 --> 05:45:48.160 align:start position:0%
or abuse of public surfaces um if we
 
05:45:50.910 --> 05:45:50.920 align:start position:0%
cannot look up and and determine if an
 
05:45:54.230 --> 05:45:54.240 align:start position:0%
individual is a mother a father or a
 
05:45:56.510 --> 05:45:56.520 align:start position:0%
child of a per certain person we're
 
05:45:57.590 --> 05:45:57.600 align:start position:0%
going to we know that there's going to
 
05:45:59.270 --> 05:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
be federal funds that are lost we can do
 
05:46:00.830 --> 05:46:00.840 align:start position:0%
that here we can talk about that in
 
05:46:03.468 --> 05:46:03.478 align:start position:0%
finance committee as well that also
 
05:46:05.468 --> 05:46:05.478 align:start position:0%
affects the efficiency and accessibility
 
05:46:08.390 --> 05:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
of services available to Residents and
 
05:46:10.150 --> 05:46:10.160 align:start position:0%
as Miss kenniston noted there are a
 
05:46:12.270 --> 05:46:12.280 align:start position:0%
number of statutes with which this bill
 
05:46:14.030 --> 05:46:14.040 align:start position:0%
conflicts it sounds like she's done a
 
05:46:17.070 --> 05:46:17.080 align:start position:0%
phenomenal job of of drafting those out
 
05:46:20.510 --> 05:46:20.520 align:start position:0%
we won't need to um add anything to that
 
05:46:22.390 --> 05:46:22.400 align:start position:0%
so and the last thing that I would just
 
05:46:24.548 --> 05:46:24.558 align:start position:0%
sort of put out in the ether is there
 
05:46:26.830 --> 05:46:26.840 align:start position:0%
are some of the program as we talk May
 
05:46:28.590 --> 05:46:28.600 align:start position:0%
address or may not in the interest of
 
05:46:29.948 --> 05:46:29.958 align:start position:0%
time time that there's also
 
05:46:29.958 --> 05:46:31.190 align:start position:0%
time time that there's also
interjurisdictional

05:46:31.190 --> 05:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
interjurisdictional
 
05:46:34.548 --> 05:46:34.558 align:start position:0%
issues um as you know all 50 states have
 
05:46:37.070 --> 05:46:37.080 align:start position:0%
adopted the same type of data that get
 
05:46:39.868 --> 05:46:39.878 align:start position:0%
collected in the same way 49 states do
 
05:46:41.590 --> 05:46:41.600 align:start position:0%
it through their Departments of Health
 
05:46:43.150 --> 05:46:43.160 align:start position:0%
one state New Hampshire does it through
 
05:46:45.150 --> 05:46:45.160 align:start position:0%
their um through their division of Vital
 
05:46:46.788 --> 05:46:46.798 align:start position:0%
Records which is not in the Department
 
05:46:50.030 --> 05:46:50.040 align:start position:0%
of Health regardless the information is
 
05:46:51.590 --> 05:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
very important to be able to be
 
05:46:54.190 --> 05:46:54.200 align:start position:0%
exchanged when we know that you know 10%
 
05:46:56.030 --> 05:46:56.040 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire residents give birth in
 
05:46:58.750 --> 05:46:58.760 align:start position:0%
New in a different state and roughly 10%
 
05:47:01.270 --> 05:47:01.280 align:start position:0%
% of people who give birth in New
 
05:47:03.548 --> 05:47:03.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire who would be respond would
 
05:47:06.868 --> 05:47:06.878 align:start position:0%
need um live in a different state so I
 
05:47:09.628 --> 05:47:09.638 align:start position:0%
am going to um ask some folks to come up
 
05:47:11.468 --> 05:47:11.478 align:start position:0%
here we're going to start with even
 
05:47:14.270 --> 05:47:14.280 align:start position:0%
though representative um Kirk noted that
 
05:47:15.868 --> 05:47:15.878 align:start position:0%
security is not an issue I actually
 
05:47:17.868 --> 05:47:17.878 align:start position:0%
think it's important to ground Us in the
 
05:47:19.948 --> 05:47:19.958 align:start position:0%
fact that the data is secure I also
 
05:47:21.310 --> 05:47:21.320 align:start position:0%
think that they can talk a little bit
 
05:47:23.310 --> 05:47:23.320 align:start position:0%
about the financial implication of
 
05:47:25.310 --> 05:47:25.320 align:start position:0%
upending every single system that we
 
05:47:26.510 --> 05:47:26.520 align:start position:0%
have in the Department of Health and
 
05:47:28.190 --> 05:47:28.200 align:start position:0%
Human Services so we're going to start
 
05:47:30.150 --> 05:47:30.160 align:start position:0%
with them then we're going to talk about
 
05:47:32.270 --> 05:47:32.280 align:start position:0%
how we do the statistics and how we use
 
05:47:34.310 --> 05:47:34.320 align:start position:0%
maternal and Child Health Data and then
 
05:47:35.990 --> 05:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
to the degree that you're interested we
 
05:47:37.670 --> 05:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
can go through all of the economic
 
05:47:39.670 --> 05:47:39.680 align:start position:0%
supports child support estate recovery
 
05:47:42.390 --> 05:47:42.400 align:start position:0%
tan up snap or just do a few we have
 
05:47:44.788 --> 05:47:44.798 align:start position:0%
experts in newborn screening um
 
05:47:46.510 --> 05:47:46.520 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt in the room we
 
05:47:48.430 --> 05:47:48.440 align:start position:0%
have other experts we have lawyers we
 
05:47:50.510 --> 05:47:50.520 align:start position:0%
have analysts all here to answer the
 
05:47:52.230 --> 05:47:52.240 align:start position:0%
questions you have so I'm talking fast
 
05:47:54.510 --> 05:47:54.520 align:start position:0%
so we can give time to Dave weers and to
 
05:47:57.628 --> 05:47:57.638 align:start position:0%
come up and um start us
 
05:47:57.638 --> 05:48:02.670 align:start position:0%
come up and um start us
off

05:48:02.670 --> 05:48:02.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:05.468 --> 05:48:05.478 align:start position:0%
so did commissioner did you hear
 
05:48:08.830 --> 05:48:08.840 align:start position:0%
anything from representative Kirk um in
 
05:48:12.390 --> 05:48:12.400 align:start position:0%
his initial re go round that uh that
 
05:48:15.590 --> 05:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
troubled you with regard to
 
05:48:18.310 --> 05:48:18.320 align:start position:0%
workability so uh we are troubled with
 
05:48:20.150 --> 05:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
the notion that the Department of Health
 
05:48:22.150 --> 05:48:22.160 align:start position:0%
and Human Services would no longer have
 
05:48:24.230 --> 05:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
the direct intangible interest in
 
05:48:27.110 --> 05:48:27.120 align:start position:0%
identifiable information we know that
 
05:48:29.590 --> 05:48:29.600 align:start position:0%
this is a place that we have a uh a an
 
05:48:31.830 --> 05:48:31.840 align:start position:0%
honest disagreement on and it's a place
 
05:48:33.670 --> 05:48:33.680 align:start position:0%
where as the the legislature you're
 
05:48:35.310 --> 05:48:35.320 align:start position:0%
going to have to make a decision moving
 
05:48:37.788 --> 05:48:37.798 align:start position:0%
forward we are always happy to spend
 
05:48:39.708 --> 05:48:39.718 align:start position:0%
some time thinking about the ways that
 
05:48:41.270 --> 05:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
we can make this better but there is
 
05:48:44.750 --> 05:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
some fundamental um impasses that we
 
05:48:45.990 --> 05:48:46.000 align:start position:0%
might not be able to get around but
 
05:48:47.510 --> 05:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
there are also probably other areas for
 
05:48:51.468 --> 05:48:51.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:54.548 --> 05:48:54.558 align:start position:0%
you um Madam chair members of the
 
05:48:55.830 --> 05:48:55.840 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for having me here
 
05:48:57.948 --> 05:48:57.958 align:start position:0%
my name is David weeders um the
 
05:49:00.310 --> 05:49:00.320 align:start position:0%
information Services director for
 
05:49:04.030 --> 05:49:04.040 align:start position:0%
DHHS and I'd like to start with once we
 
05:49:06.230 --> 05:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
receive the data in order to perform
 
05:49:08.030 --> 05:49:08.040 align:start position:0%
Services all the different services that
 
05:49:09.750 --> 05:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
you've heard um associate commissioner
 
05:49:13.350 --> 05:49:13.360 align:start position:0%
Trisha Tilly speak to we have to ingest
 
05:49:15.708 --> 05:49:15.718 align:start position:0%
it and move it through our very robust
 
05:49:17.670 --> 05:49:17.680 align:start position:0%
data governance and data security and
 
05:49:21.070 --> 05:49:21.080 align:start position:0%
privacy practices and so we take this
 
05:49:23.750 --> 05:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
very seriously but as part of doing that
 
05:49:25.510 --> 05:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
we integrate with a lot of different
 
05:49:28.070 --> 05:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
systems each of those systems are under
 
05:49:31.190 --> 05:49:31.200 align:start position:0%
contract with different vendors and
 
05:49:34.150 --> 05:49:34.160 align:start position:0%
those contracts follow our security and
 
05:49:35.948 --> 05:49:35.958 align:start position:0%
privacy or privacy and security
 
05:49:38.150 --> 05:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
practices to ensure that they're hippot
 
05:49:40.830 --> 05:49:40.840 align:start position:0%
trained that they're following all state
 
05:49:42.468 --> 05:49:42.478 align:start position:0%
and federal laws and that they're
 
05:49:44.468 --> 05:49:44.478 align:start position:0%
following our specific data governance
 
05:49:46.628 --> 05:49:46.638 align:start position:0%
practices for how data is managed
 
05:49:49.468 --> 05:49:49.478 align:start position:0%
throughout the department so we when
 
05:49:52.030 --> 05:49:52.040 align:start position:0%
earlier in the discussion I think
 
05:49:53.830 --> 05:49:53.840 align:start position:0%
represent Schmidt you asked about
 
05:49:55.548 --> 05:49:55.558 align:start position:0%
policies for Secretary State and how
 
05:49:57.788 --> 05:49:57.798 align:start position:0%
they managed and they had a number of
 
05:49:59.750 --> 05:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
laws that govern how they manage the
 
05:50:02.430 --> 05:50:02.440 align:start position:0%
data we have the same laws but then on
 
05:50:03.948 --> 05:50:03.958 align:start position:0%
top of that just like they have with
 
05:50:06.788 --> 05:50:06.798 align:start position:0%
HIPPA training we also because we
 
05:50:08.708 --> 05:50:08.718 align:start position:0%
receive all that information into what
 
05:50:11.468 --> 05:50:11.478 align:start position:0%
we call an Enterprise data warehouse we
 
05:50:14.150 --> 05:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
have very specific policies as how that
 
05:50:16.990 --> 05:50:17.000 align:start position:0%
is managed so we have confidentiality
 
05:50:18.628 --> 05:50:18.638 align:start position:0%
and business use agreements for every
 
05:50:20.670 --> 05:50:20.680 align:start position:0%
individual regardless if they're a state
 
05:50:23.788 --> 05:50:23.798 align:start position:0%
employee or a contractor that has to be
 
05:50:26.750 --> 05:50:26.760 align:start position:0%
signed in order to control what they are
 
05:50:28.510 --> 05:50:28.520 align:start position:0%
allowed to do and what the ramification
 
05:50:30.670 --> 05:50:30.680 align:start position:0%
ations are if they do not manage the
 
05:50:33.430 --> 05:50:33.440 align:start position:0%
data properly we also have asset use
 
05:50:35.350 --> 05:50:35.360 align:start position:0%
agreements on how they manage our assets
 
05:50:37.230 --> 05:50:37.240 align:start position:0%
how they utilize assets that we give to
 
05:50:39.868 --> 05:50:39.878 align:start position:0%
them we have our data classification
 
05:50:42.830 --> 05:50:42.840 align:start position:0%
policy in this case um we have multiple
 
05:50:45.390 --> 05:50:45.400 align:start position:0%
levels um this is the highest level so
 
05:50:46.948 --> 05:50:46.958 align:start position:0%
Vital Records data is the highest level
 
05:50:48.990 --> 05:50:49.000 align:start position:0%
it's regulated and Regulatory and
 
05:50:51.910 --> 05:50:51.920 align:start position:0%
compliance data so it's marked in our
 
05:50:54.868 --> 05:50:54.878 align:start position:0%
Data Systems as the most stringent
 
05:50:56.910 --> 05:50:56.920 align:start position:0%
access what that means is we follow
 
05:50:59.628 --> 05:50:59.638 align:start position:0%
minimal use and so minimal use really
 
05:51:01.868 --> 05:51:01.878 align:start position:0%
comes to if you're in child support you
 
05:51:04.628 --> 05:51:04.638 align:start position:0%
need specific fields in order to move
 
05:51:06.390 --> 05:51:06.400 align:start position:0%
forward with the child support services
 
05:51:07.948 --> 05:51:07.958 align:start position:0%
you might not need the health related
 
05:51:11.070 --> 05:51:11.080 align:start position:0%
data that public health needs and in
 
05:51:13.070 --> 05:51:13.080 align:start position:0%
economic stability you also need
 
05:51:14.590 --> 05:51:14.600 align:start position:0%
specific Fields I'm not going to go into
 
05:51:15.990 --> 05:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
the details of the fields because you
 
05:51:17.390 --> 05:51:17.400 align:start position:0%
probably get pretty bored of all the
 
05:51:19.030 --> 05:51:19.040 align:start position:0%
tables and all the other components
 
05:51:21.070 --> 05:51:21.080 align:start position:0%
associated with that but you don't need
 
05:51:23.590 --> 05:51:23.600 align:start position:0%
the entire record set so we manage that
 
05:51:25.190 --> 05:51:25.200 align:start position:0%
through our Enterprise statea warehouse
 
05:51:27.270 --> 05:51:27.280 align:start position:0%
and Enterprise business intelligence Pro
 
05:51:29.868 --> 05:51:29.878 align:start position:0%
system and the data governance processes
 
05:51:32.670 --> 05:51:32.680 align:start position:0%
that we have within that data governance
 
05:51:35.910 --> 05:51:35.920 align:start position:0%
we have data stewards and so what what
 
05:51:38.390 --> 05:51:38.400 align:start position:0%
we did did on purpose we identified data
 
05:51:41.230 --> 05:51:41.240 align:start position:0%
storage within every program area that
 
05:51:42.788 --> 05:51:42.798 align:start position:0%
is responsible for understanding the
 
05:51:45.430 --> 05:51:45.440 align:start position:0%
laws governing the data including our
 
05:51:48.110 --> 05:51:48.120 align:start position:0%
state constitutional rights regarding
 
05:51:51.590 --> 05:51:51.600 align:start position:0%
privacy as well as the best practices on
 
05:51:54.868 --> 05:51:54.878 align:start position:0%
how to secure that data so once you know
 
05:51:56.628 --> 05:51:56.638 align:start position:0%
what data you're getting and the privacy
 
05:51:58.868 --> 05:51:58.878 align:start position:0%
laws regarding it now you have to make
 
05:52:00.590 --> 05:52:00.600 align:start position:0%
sure you're securing that information so
 
05:52:01.788 --> 05:52:01.798 align:start position:0%
that's what the data Steward is supposed
 
05:52:04.548 --> 05:52:04.558 align:start position:0%
to do and they are trained through
 
05:52:06.030 --> 05:52:06.040 align:start position:0%
multiple different training we have a
 
05:52:08.270 --> 05:52:08.280 align:start position:0%
training policy that requires everyone
 
05:52:10.390 --> 05:52:10.400 align:start position:0%
to go through that training and then
 
05:52:14.868 --> 05:52:14.878 align:start position:0%
they tell our our my division or Bureau
 
05:52:17.468 --> 05:52:17.478 align:start position:0%
who can have access and to what What
 
05:52:19.150 --> 05:52:19.160 align:start position:0%
fields and data that they can have
 
05:52:21.350 --> 05:52:21.360 align:start position:0%
access to I'm trying to express that
 
05:52:22.948 --> 05:52:22.958 align:start position:0%
specifically so you understand that we
 
05:52:26.670 --> 05:52:26.680 align:start position:0%
don't just give 3,000 people in DHHS
 
05:52:29.190 --> 05:52:29.200 align:start position:0%
access to the data it's actually 338
 
05:52:32.830 --> 05:52:32.840 align:start position:0%
people and out out of those 338 people
 
05:52:34.390 --> 05:52:34.400 align:start position:0%
not all of them have access to the
 
05:52:37.310 --> 05:52:37.320 align:start position:0%
entire data set and so it's really it
 
05:52:39.110 --> 05:52:39.120 align:start position:0%
gets even smaller and smaller as it goes
 
05:52:43.990 --> 05:52:44.000 align:start position:0%
forward so the the chances of um misuse
 
05:52:46.230 --> 05:52:46.240 align:start position:0%
is very small and the chances of
 
05:52:47.990 --> 05:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
actually providing care and better
 
05:52:50.670 --> 05:52:50.680 align:start position:0%
Client Services is very high because
 
05:52:51.948 --> 05:52:51.958 align:start position:0%
we're sharing this
 
05:52:54.150 --> 05:52:54.160 align:start position:0%
information we have other policies that
 
05:52:56.430 --> 05:52:56.440 align:start position:0%
I won't go into but I'm certainly here
 
05:52:58.990 --> 05:52:59.000 align:start position:0%
to address some of that if you have any
 
05:53:00.510 --> 05:53:00.520 align:start position:0%
questions specifically regarding
 
05:53:02.548 --> 05:53:02.558 align:start position:0%
security and privacy as it relates to
 
05:53:06.030 --> 05:53:06.040 align:start position:0%
the data the other component is because
 
05:53:07.548 --> 05:53:07.558 align:start position:0%
of the integration with some of our
 
05:53:09.270 --> 05:53:09.280 align:start position:0%
systems and you might have heard terms
 
05:53:10.910 --> 05:53:10.920 align:start position:0%
like new heights which is our integrated
 
05:53:13.230 --> 05:53:13.240 align:start position:0%
eligibility and enrollment system which
 
05:53:16.270 --> 05:53:16.280 align:start position:0%
manages access to food stamps um cash
 
05:53:19.030 --> 05:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
assistance and U Medicaid as well as
 
05:53:21.548 --> 05:53:21.558 align:start position:0%
foster care programming and then our
 
05:53:23.548 --> 05:53:23.558 align:start position:0%
Nexus system which is our child support
 
05:53:26.350 --> 05:53:26.360 align:start position:0%
system our Medicaid system for Medicaid
 
05:53:28.350 --> 05:53:28.360 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries and it goes on there's a
 
05:53:30.350 --> 05:53:30.360 align:start position:0%
number of different systems each one of
 
05:53:32.868 --> 05:53:32.878 align:start position:0%
those systems are managed by a vendor in
 
05:53:35.230 --> 05:53:35.240 align:start position:0%
order to change our practices we would
 
05:53:37.548 --> 05:53:37.558 align:start position:0%
have to change amend all of those
 
05:53:40.910 --> 05:53:40.920 align:start position:0%
contracts and change and pull that data
 
05:53:44.190 --> 05:53:44.200 align:start position:0%
out and make sure that it's expunged and
 
05:53:46.830 --> 05:53:46.840 align:start position:0%
in its entirety which would cost
 
05:53:48.708 --> 05:53:48.718 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars across the different
 
05:53:50.430 --> 05:53:50.440 align:start position:0%
contracted systems and the reason why I
 
05:53:52.110 --> 05:53:52.120 align:start position:0%
say it's millions of dollars and not a
 
05:53:54.070 --> 05:53:54.080 align:start position:0%
specific number is we would have to
 
05:53:56.150 --> 05:53:56.160 align:start position:0%
actually go and engage with them do an
 
05:53:57.788 --> 05:53:57.798 align:start position:0%
amendment get it approved through
 
05:53:59.990 --> 05:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
government executive counsel and then
 
05:54:01.548 --> 05:54:01.558 align:start position:0%
move forward with the initiative to
 
05:54:04.350 --> 05:54:04.360 align:start position:0%
actually do the work um historically
 
05:54:07.868 --> 05:54:07.878 align:start position:0%
those amendments are upwards of 800,000
 
05:54:10.468 --> 05:54:10.478 align:start position:0%
to anywhere in the three to four million
 
05:54:12.948 --> 05:54:12.958 align:start position:0%
depending on the vendor and so I'm using
 
05:54:14.868 --> 05:54:14.878 align:start position:0%
it based off a historical knowledge of
 
05:54:17.990 --> 05:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
those amendments to do this type of work
 
05:54:20.868 --> 05:54:20.878 align:start position:0%
um I'm certainly open to more discussion
 
05:54:23.110 --> 05:54:23.120 align:start position:0%
if you have questions I can go into
 
05:54:24.670 --> 05:54:24.680 align:start position:0%
detail and bore you even more if you
 
05:54:26.430 --> 05:54:26.440 align:start position:0%
wish and it's up to
 
05:54:33.628 --> 05:54:33.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:37.468 --> 05:54:37.478 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um this data
 
05:54:40.750 --> 05:54:40.760 align:start position:0%
collection and sharing how has it
 
05:54:44.788 --> 05:54:44.798 align:start position:0%
shifted from physical record to
 
05:54:48.548 --> 05:54:48.558 align:start position:0%
electronic medical record that shift is
 
05:54:49.628 --> 05:54:49.638 align:start position:0%
a huge
 
05:54:52.868 --> 05:54:52.878 align:start position:0%
shift click of one button can go to
 
05:54:55.510 --> 05:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
different places versus
 
05:55:00.350 --> 05:55:00.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:02.628 --> 05:55:02.638 align:start position:0%
world thank you representative that's a
 
05:55:05.070 --> 05:55:05.080 align:start position:0%
very good question um since the Advent
 
05:55:07.468 --> 05:55:07.478 align:start position:0%
of technology and electronic health
 
05:55:09.628 --> 05:55:09.638 align:start position:0%
record systems and that interoperability
 
05:55:12.430 --> 05:55:12.440 align:start position:0%
and exchange of data in a digital world
 
05:55:14.468 --> 05:55:14.478 align:start position:0%
it allows for actually even more
 
05:55:17.628 --> 05:55:17.638 align:start position:0%
stringent controls over the data yes you
 
05:55:20.230 --> 05:55:20.240 align:start position:0%
can at a click of a button potentially
 
05:55:23.708 --> 05:55:23.718 align:start position:0%
share it with more people however we
 
05:55:25.548 --> 05:55:25.558 align:start position:0%
have Protections in place which are
 
05:55:28.030 --> 05:55:28.040 align:start position:0%
called like data leakage protection so
 
05:55:30.468 --> 05:55:30.478 align:start position:0%
on our email systems in order to send
 
05:55:32.788 --> 05:55:32.798 align:start position:0%
data out if you send data out with
 
05:55:34.708 --> 05:55:34.718 align:start position:0%
social security number or a birth date
 
05:55:36.628 --> 05:55:36.638 align:start position:0%
or any that type of information it
 
05:55:39.670 --> 05:55:39.680 align:start position:0%
actually catches that and securely and
 
05:55:41.310 --> 05:55:41.320 align:start position:0%
encrypts it on purpose and actually
 
05:55:43.110 --> 05:55:43.120 align:start position:0%
sends you back saying hey you're you're
 
05:55:45.628 --> 05:55:45.638 align:start position:0%
sending this data to an outside Source
 
05:55:47.230 --> 05:55:47.240 align:start position:0%
are you sure you want to move it forward
 
05:55:51.270 --> 05:55:51.280 align:start position:0%
and it presents a secure connection and
 
05:55:53.030 --> 05:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
we have reports on that so if somebody
 
05:55:58.030 --> 05:55:58.040 align:start position:0%
sends out data inadvertently to 100
 
05:55:59.868 --> 05:55:59.878 align:start position:0%
people that would be considered a
 
05:56:02.750 --> 05:56:02.760 align:start position:0%
security event first and we'd go and we
 
05:56:04.390 --> 05:56:04.400 align:start position:0%
actually have what we call a security
 
05:56:07.590 --> 05:56:07.600 align:start position:0%
incident response team that gets gets
 
05:56:09.830 --> 05:56:09.840 align:start position:0%
enacted and goes and finds out exactly
 
05:56:13.110 --> 05:56:13.120 align:start position:0%
who that data was shared with and was it
 
05:56:14.708 --> 05:56:14.718 align:start position:0%
was was it shared with people that were
 
05:56:16.788 --> 05:56:16.798 align:start position:0%
contracted with the department and are
 
05:56:18.510 --> 05:56:18.520 align:start position:0%
covered under Hippa and all the other
 
05:56:20.468 --> 05:56:20.478 align:start position:0%
concerns or if they're not and if
 
05:56:22.230 --> 05:56:22.240 align:start position:0%
they're not it becomes a reportable
 
05:56:25.788 --> 05:56:25.798 align:start position:0%
event to both CMS and OCR and other
 
05:56:30.190 --> 05:56:30.200 align:start position:0%
Federal Regulation or fed regulatory um
 
05:56:32.590 --> 05:56:32.600 align:start position:0%
organizations and we have a mitigation
 
05:56:34.510 --> 05:56:34.520 align:start position:0%
plan to say how do we prevent that in
 
05:56:36.670 --> 05:56:36.680 align:start position:0%
the future it's the same as if if you
 
05:56:39.590 --> 05:56:39.600 align:start position:0%
had a paper system and someone came in
 
05:56:43.030 --> 05:56:43.040 align:start position:0%
having forbid and robbed your office and
 
05:56:45.030 --> 05:56:45.040 align:start position:0%
took all your files you would also be
 
05:56:47.390 --> 05:56:47.400 align:start position:0%
obligated to do the same exact instant
 
05:56:50.548 --> 05:56:50.558 align:start position:0%
response at which point you would um
 
05:56:52.830 --> 05:56:52.840 align:start position:0%
still have to report because the data in
 
05:56:54.708 --> 05:56:54.718 align:start position:0%
physical form and digital form you still
 
05:56:57.548 --> 05:56:57.558 align:start position:0%
have to do the same protections so when
 
05:56:59.590 --> 05:56:59.600 align:start position:0%
I look at this from a perspective of
 
05:57:01.350 --> 05:57:01.360 align:start position:0%
security and
 
05:57:04.430 --> 05:57:04.440 align:start position:0%
privacy um I personally would rather my
 
05:57:06.310 --> 05:57:06.320 align:start position:0%
data in the digital world because I know
 
05:57:09.150 --> 05:57:09.160 align:start position:0%
that there's keys in multiple doors in
 
05:57:11.510 --> 05:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
front of that data so in order to get
 
05:57:14.468 --> 05:57:14.478 align:start position:0%
access to that information it in its
 
05:57:16.868 --> 05:57:16.878 align:start position:0%
entirety you have to know all those
 
05:57:18.390 --> 05:57:18.400 align:start position:0%
doors go through data governance
 
05:57:20.190 --> 05:57:20.200 align:start position:0%
processes follow the right forms get the
 
05:57:22.270 --> 05:57:22.280 align:start position:0%
data stewards to approve it and move it
 
05:57:25.510 --> 05:57:25.520 align:start position:0%
forward can a few records be shared
 
05:57:27.990 --> 05:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
inadvertently yes you have that risk in
 
05:57:32.270 --> 05:57:32.280 align:start position:0%
a physical or a digital world either
 
05:57:34.590 --> 05:57:34.600 align:start position:0%
way the only thing that I would add is
 
05:57:36.190 --> 05:57:36.200 align:start position:0%
just the opportunity sometime you may
 
05:57:37.670 --> 05:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
want to talk with the division of Vital
 
05:57:40.670 --> 05:57:40.680 align:start position:0%
Records they've really been um and
 
05:57:42.750 --> 05:57:42.760 align:start position:0%
probably uh representative boltim is
 
05:57:45.468 --> 05:57:45.478 align:start position:0%
also to um be credited for this the
 
05:57:47.350 --> 05:57:47.360 align:start position:0%
digital uh work that we have done in
 
05:57:48.468 --> 05:57:48.478 align:start position:0%
vital records has really been
 
05:57:50.110 --> 05:57:50.120 align:start position:0%
extraordinary and long I've worked for
 
05:57:51.468 --> 05:57:51.478 align:start position:0%
the Department for close to a quarter
 
05:57:53.548 --> 05:57:53.558 align:start position:0%
Century that has been electronic and New
 
05:57:55.150 --> 05:57:55.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's really led the way in some
 
05:57:57.868 --> 05:57:57.878 align:start position:0%
of these issues around security of of
 
05:58:02.270 --> 05:58:02.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:04.468 --> 05:58:04.478 align:start position:0%
data if the committee doesn't have any
 
05:58:06.670 --> 05:58:06.680 align:start position:0%
other questions do you have any other
 
05:58:08.750 --> 05:58:08.760 align:start position:0%
we'll move up so um thank you I would
 
05:58:11.150 --> 05:58:11.160 align:start position:0%
like to invite chawe and Lisa to come up
 
05:58:13.070 --> 05:58:13.080 align:start position:0%
right now um they're going to talk very
 
05:58:15.468 --> 05:58:15.478 align:start position:0%
shortly about what we do especially with
 
05:58:17.190 --> 05:58:17.200 align:start position:0%
some of the health information because I
 
05:58:18.830 --> 05:58:18.840 align:start position:0%
know that's a concern and then we'll get
 
05:58:21.110 --> 05:58:21.120 align:start position:0%
to the economics so how do we use this
 
05:58:23.708 --> 05:58:23.718 align:start position:0%
how do we create health statistics um
 
05:58:26.030 --> 05:58:26.040 align:start position:0%
and how is that used in the community
 
05:58:27.788 --> 05:58:27.798 align:start position:0%
and we're going to be very short I'm
 
05:58:29.430 --> 05:58:29.440 align:start position:0%
going to hand something out to you stack
 
05:58:31.990 --> 05:58:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:34.350 --> 05:58:34.360 align:start position:0%
reports what I will do right now we have
 
05:58:36.590 --> 05:58:36.600 align:start position:0%
two reports that are just examples of
 
05:58:38.708 --> 05:58:38.718 align:start position:0%
things that simply would not exist
 
05:58:40.910 --> 05:58:40.920 align:start position:0%
anymore if we did not have access to
 
05:58:40.920 --> 05:58:56.628 align:start position:0%
anymore if we did not have access to
this

05:58:56.628 --> 05:58:56.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:56.638 --> 05:59:02.430 align:start position:0%
 
data

05:59:02.430 --> 05:59:02.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:04.548 --> 05:59:04.558 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry let me just are these two
 
05:59:07.030 --> 05:59:07.040 align:start position:0%
separate handouts okay okay thank you
 
05:59:07.040 --> 05:59:11.628 align:start position:0%
separate handouts okay okay thank you
thank

05:59:11.628 --> 05:59:11.638 align:start position:0%

06:00:42.190 --> 06:00:42.200 align:start position:0%
department and with the mou that the
 
06:00:44.230 --> 06:00:44.240 align:start position:0%
department has with division of Vital
 
06:00:46.868 --> 06:00:46.878 align:start position:0%
Records under the Secretary of State uh
 
06:00:48.750 --> 06:00:48.760 align:start position:0%
the bureau also perform Vital Records
 
06:00:52.788 --> 06:00:52.798 align:start position:0%
data QA which is very important uh part
 
06:00:54.788 --> 06:00:54.798 align:start position:0%
uh under this agreement that the
 
06:00:57.750 --> 06:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
department provided the data uh quality
 
06:00:59.948 --> 06:00:59.958 align:start position:0%
control and Assurance result back to
 
06:01:02.948 --> 06:01:02.958 align:start position:0%
division of Vital Records so because of
 
06:01:06.468 --> 06:01:06.478 align:start position:0%
this we have found uh several data
 
06:01:09.548 --> 06:01:09.558 align:start position:0%
issues um and we report back to division
 
06:01:12.628 --> 06:01:12.638 align:start position:0%
of Vital Records some example is like
 
06:01:15.310 --> 06:01:15.320 align:start position:0%
during the inter uh jurisdictional
 
06:01:19.150 --> 06:01:19.160 align:start position:0%
exchange the out of state records we
 
06:01:22.030 --> 06:01:22.040 align:start position:0%
received from uh Massachusetts for the
 
06:01:24.468 --> 06:01:24.478 align:start position:0%
death records uh some of them did not
 
06:01:29.430 --> 06:01:29.440 align:start position:0%
have ICD code um which is a very key
 
06:01:32.708 --> 06:01:32.718 align:start position:0%
information for us to understand um the
 
06:01:34.868 --> 06:01:34.878 align:start position:0%
cause of the death and we work with the
 
06:01:37.990 --> 06:01:38.000 align:start position:0%
battle record for them to con contact
 
06:01:40.708 --> 06:01:40.718 align:start position:0%
the massachusett to understand uh you
 
06:01:42.750 --> 06:01:42.760 align:start position:0%
know if there was any issues in their
 
06:01:45.230 --> 06:01:45.240 align:start position:0%
system so the the purpose I mentioned
 
06:01:47.468 --> 06:01:47.478 align:start position:0%
this is uh the department performed this
 
06:01:50.070 --> 06:01:50.080 align:start position:0%
type of a qway and in order for us to
 
06:01:51.990 --> 06:01:52.000 align:start position:0%
perform this type of qway we do need to
 
06:01:54.310 --> 06:01:54.320 align:start position:0%
have identifiers in order to report back
 
06:01:56.510 --> 06:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
to division of battle records which
 
06:01:59.390 --> 06:01:59.400 align:start position:0%
records or which records have some
 
06:02:02.190 --> 06:02:02.200 align:start position:0%
specific issues and the finding that we
 
06:02:05.750 --> 06:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
found uh during the record um
 
06:02:08.230 --> 06:02:08.240 align:start position:0%
validation another part that the
 
06:02:10.910 --> 06:02:10.920 align:start position:0%
identifiers is very important at Le for
 
06:02:14.990 --> 06:02:15.000 align:start position:0%
the uh Health statistic work is address
 
06:02:18.030 --> 06:02:18.040 align:start position:0%
um validation so the data quality
 
06:02:21.548 --> 06:02:21.558 align:start position:0%
provided by V records uh DVR excuse me
 
06:02:24.948 --> 06:02:24.958 align:start position:0%
is pretty good uh we do found we do find
 
06:02:28.430 --> 06:02:28.440 align:start position:0%
uh some records that um you know address
 
06:02:31.110 --> 06:02:31.120 align:start position:0%
is not pared correctly in terms of a
 
06:02:34.468 --> 06:02:34.478 align:start position:0%
county or public health regions that may
 
06:02:37.350 --> 06:02:37.360 align:start position:0%
be because uh the record was updated or
 
06:02:39.310 --> 06:02:39.320 align:start position:0%
maybe because those records are from out
 
06:02:41.990 --> 06:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
of state uh on New Hampshire residents
 
06:02:45.670 --> 06:02:45.680 align:start position:0%
that um this type of address is not um
 
06:02:48.708 --> 06:02:48.718 align:start position:0%
accurate or or coded wrongly some
 
06:02:51.310 --> 06:02:51.320 align:start position:0%
example is like bad firm New Hampshire
 
06:02:53.990 --> 06:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
may have Massachusetts ZIP code or bford
 
06:02:55.708 --> 06:02:55.718 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts may have New Hampshire ZIP
 
06:02:58.350 --> 06:02:58.360 align:start position:0%
code and the county we also found that
 
06:03:02.110 --> 06:03:02.120 align:start position:0%
some record has C conquered address on
 
06:03:04.788 --> 06:03:04.798 align:start position:0%
uh City conquered however the county is
 
06:03:08.190 --> 06:03:08.200 align:start position:0%
coas County so this type of data qual um
 
06:03:10.868 --> 06:03:10.878 align:start position:0%
validation and QA work we work very
 
06:03:13.548 --> 06:03:13.558 align:start position:0%
closely with the division of V records
 
06:03:16.230 --> 06:03:16.240 align:start position:0%
and uh the bureau also perform us a uh
 
06:03:18.948 --> 06:03:18.958 align:start position:0%
point of contact to work with the V
 
06:03:18.958 --> 06:03:21.070 align:start position:0%
point of contact to work with the V
record

06:03:21.070 --> 06:03:21.080 align:start position:0%
record
 
06:03:24.150 --> 06:03:24.160 align:start position:0%
directly as for the health
 
06:03:28.270 --> 06:03:28.280 align:start position:0%
statistics the bureau um also produ uh
 
06:03:31.150 --> 06:03:31.160 align:start position:0%
produce excuse me the DHHS data portal
 
06:03:33.868 --> 06:03:33.878 align:start position:0%
currently we have more than 50 uh
 
06:03:36.708 --> 06:03:36.718 align:start position:0%
indicators from both birth and death uh
 
06:03:40.230 --> 06:03:40.240 align:start position:0%
V records datas and
 
06:03:44.830 --> 06:03:44.840 align:start position:0%
um I just want to emphasize that uh the
 
06:03:47.990 --> 06:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
if this bill um in
 
06:03:50.868 --> 06:03:50.878 align:start position:0%
act that will restrict the department to
 
06:03:53.830 --> 06:03:53.840 align:start position:0%
receive interjurisdictional data that is
 
06:03:58.670 --> 06:03:58.680 align:start position:0%
a huge um impact on us so I just want to
 
06:04:02.230 --> 06:04:02.240 align:start position:0%
provide some information uh regarding
 
06:04:05.030 --> 06:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
the neighbor State or how we we we we
 
06:04:08.070 --> 06:04:08.080 align:start position:0%
have um the the out of state data for
 
06:04:10.190 --> 06:04:10.200 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire residents so apparent
 
06:04:13.948 --> 06:04:13.958 align:start position:0%
um averagely 10% of the data in B
 
06:04:17.030 --> 06:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
recular birth and and that is from out
 
06:04:20.190 --> 06:04:20.200 align:start position:0%
of state on New Hampshire residence so
 
06:04:23.830 --> 06:04:23.840 align:start position:0%
uh between 2019 and
 
06:04:27.270 --> 06:04:27.280 align:start position:0%
2023 um several towns has have
 
06:04:29.548 --> 06:04:29.558 align:start position:0%
significantly out of state birth and
 
06:04:33.390 --> 06:04:33.400 align:start position:0%
death so for example PLO uh in between
 
06:04:35.788 --> 06:04:35.798 align:start position:0%
2019 and
 
06:04:39.788 --> 06:04:39.798 align:start position:0%
2023 63% of babies were born out of
 
06:04:43.350 --> 06:04:43.360 align:start position:0%
state so without this data we won't know
 
06:04:49.270 --> 06:04:49.280 align:start position:0%
63% of um birth records how you know we
 
06:04:51.270 --> 06:04:51.280 align:start position:0%
won't have the the accit to those birth
 
06:04:55.830 --> 06:04:55.840 align:start position:0%
records and in Salem similar with plasto
 
06:04:59.590 --> 06:04:59.600 align:start position:0%
62.9 B is were born out of
 
06:05:02.548 --> 06:05:02.558 align:start position:0%
state yeah yeah and and that has huge
 
06:05:04.670 --> 06:05:04.680 align:start position:0%
impacts in terms of our ability to again
 
06:05:06.110 --> 06:05:06.120 align:start position:0%
to not only the public health the
 
06:05:08.270 --> 06:05:08.280 align:start position:0%
statistics but also the economic
 
06:05:09.910 --> 06:05:09.920 align:start position:0%
supports because we simply would not
 
06:05:12.270 --> 06:05:12.280 align:start position:0%
have that information on a b a Salem
 
06:05:14.948 --> 06:05:14.958 align:start position:0%
resident who was born across the board
 
06:05:18.310 --> 06:05:18.320 align:start position:0%
yes um so other than that the bureau
 
06:05:21.628 --> 06:05:21.638 align:start position:0%
also performed uh data linkage project
 
06:05:24.750 --> 06:05:24.760 align:start position:0%
um I also sorry before we go to data
 
06:05:26.830 --> 06:05:26.840 align:start position:0%
linkage project I just want to um also
 
06:05:29.310 --> 06:05:29.320 align:start position:0%
mention mentioned that under the mou uh
 
06:05:31.910 --> 06:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
the department um and the division of V
 
06:05:34.670 --> 06:05:34.680 align:start position:0%
records uh established the V record
 
06:05:37.070 --> 06:05:37.080 align:start position:0%
privacy board and this board the purpose
 
06:05:39.110 --> 06:05:39.120 align:start position:0%
of this board is to review all the
 
06:05:41.270 --> 06:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
confidential data request for Vital
 
06:05:45.150 --> 06:05:45.160 align:start position:0%
Records data uh all the application and
 
06:05:47.910 --> 06:05:47.920 align:start position:0%
also the um contined use application
 
06:05:50.468 --> 06:05:50.478 align:start position:0%
will go to the board uh for review and
 
06:05:53.990 --> 06:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
approval once the request is approved
 
06:05:55.830 --> 06:05:55.840 align:start position:0%
then the Department of Health Human
 
06:05:58.750 --> 06:05:58.760 align:start position:0%
Services will distributed the data based
 
06:06:01.948 --> 06:06:01.958 align:start position:0%
on the approval uh from the board uh if
 
06:06:04.350 --> 06:06:04.360 align:start position:0%
we are not able to uh receive all the
 
06:06:06.670 --> 06:06:06.680 align:start position:0%
identifiers then the department will not
 
06:06:09.070 --> 06:06:09.080 align:start position:0%
be able to perform this type of work
 
06:06:10.670 --> 06:06:10.680 align:start position:0%
because all the confidential data
 
06:06:13.548 --> 06:06:13.558 align:start position:0%
request most of them or all of them
 
06:06:16.230 --> 06:06:16.240 align:start position:0%
require like a names address and all the
 
06:06:18.350 --> 06:06:18.360 align:start position:0%
identifiers and of course they all have
 
06:06:21.030 --> 06:06:21.040 align:start position:0%
IRB approval that's the part that the
 
06:06:22.468 --> 06:06:22.478 align:start position:0%
board will review and all the
 
06:06:24.390 --> 06:06:24.400 align:start position:0%
applications and also supplemental
 
06:06:26.670 --> 06:06:26.680 align:start position:0%
documents will uh provide to the board
 
06:06:29.190 --> 06:06:29.200 align:start position:0%
for review and approval not all the
 
06:06:31.230 --> 06:06:31.240 align:start position:0%
studies will be approved they need to
 
06:06:34.468 --> 06:06:34.478 align:start position:0%
have a very specific study designs and
 
06:06:38.150 --> 06:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
purpose and good uh study um Logic for
 
06:06:40.670 --> 06:06:40.680 align:start position:0%
the board to be able to consider and
 
06:06:43.110 --> 06:06:43.120 align:start position:0%
approve this type of study so the
 
06:06:45.270 --> 06:06:45.280 align:start position:0%
department also perform this kind of a
 
06:06:48.830 --> 06:06:48.840 align:start position:0%
um discrimination on This Confidential
 
06:06:51.390 --> 06:06:51.400 align:start position:0%
data request if the department is not
 
06:06:55.788 --> 06:06:55.798 align:start position:0%
able to receive all the identifiers uh
 
06:06:57.830 --> 06:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
and also the house statistic
 
06:07:00.430 --> 06:07:00.440 align:start position:0%
informations then for this type of work
 
06:07:02.548 --> 06:07:02.558 align:start position:0%
we won't be able to
 
06:07:07.190 --> 06:07:07.200 align:start position:0%
perform yeah um before Lisa starts as we
 
06:07:08.548 --> 06:07:08.558 align:start position:0%
get ready Lisa is going to talk a little
 
06:07:09.990 --> 06:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
bit about the programmatic I believe
 
06:07:11.830 --> 06:07:11.840 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire has a question
 
06:07:14.270 --> 06:07:14.280 align:start position:0%
yes thank you the vital records privacy
 
06:07:16.628 --> 06:07:16.638 align:start position:0%
board how was that created who I mean
 
06:07:22.510 --> 06:07:22.520 align:start position:0%
who authorized it uh it's under um sorry
 
06:07:22.520 --> 06:07:24.150 align:start position:0%
who authorized it uh it's under um sorry
1262

06:07:24.150 --> 06:07:24.160 align:start position:0%
1262
 
06:07:28.670 --> 06:07:28.680 align:start position:0%
12625 C uh under the um mou that we have
 
06:07:30.548 --> 06:07:30.558 align:start position:0%
the department has with the division of
 
06:07:32.868 --> 06:07:32.878 align:start position:0%
V records and the SOS and I and I would
 
06:07:34.708 --> 06:07:34.718 align:start position:0%
just add that part of the reason why um
 
06:07:36.990 --> 06:07:37.000 align:start position:0%
DHHS is tasked with that is because we
 
06:07:39.350 --> 06:07:39.360 align:start position:0%
are the hippoc covered entity not the
 
06:07:41.468 --> 06:07:41.478 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office I was just

statute it is in statute thank you it's
 
06:07:47.548 --> 06:07:47.558 align:start position:0%
a statute and statute also say that
 
06:07:49.868 --> 06:07:49.878 align:start position:0%
three uh three members will be appointed
 
06:07:52.628 --> 06:07:52.638 align:start position:0%
by the commissioner of DHHS and three
 
06:07:55.150 --> 06:07:55.160 align:start position:0%
members will be appointed by the SOS

06:08:32.310 --> 06:08:32.320 align:start position:0%
one is just a report that we're working
 
06:08:35.350 --> 06:08:35.360 align:start position:0%
that's used right now to um to design
 
06:08:37.510 --> 06:08:37.520 align:start position:0%
Medicaid services what's our rate
 
06:08:40.830 --> 06:08:40.840 align:start position:0%
setting and our U Med Medicaid Managed
 
06:08:42.788 --> 06:08:42.798 align:start position:0%
Care Program those are just
 
06:08:44.708 --> 06:08:44.718 align:start position:0%
informational but it's exactly the type
 
06:08:46.948 --> 06:08:46.958 align:start position:0%
of data that chawe was discussing that
 
06:08:49.070 --> 06:08:49.080 align:start position:0%
we would no we simply would not be able
 
06:08:51.390 --> 06:08:51.400 align:start position:0%
to perform any of that data analysis
 
06:08:53.390 --> 06:08:53.400 align:start position:0%
anymore if this bill were to move
 
06:08:55.990 --> 06:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
forward these have fiscal implications
 
06:08:58.190 --> 06:08:58.200 align:start position:0%
which I think um Lisa can talk about
 
06:09:00.430 --> 06:09:00.440 align:start position:0%
because um in general and we were asked
 
06:09:02.110 --> 06:09:02.120 align:start position:0%
this in the previous committee what does
 
06:09:04.110 --> 06:09:04.120 align:start position:0%
it mean you'll lose this money well
 
06:09:06.788 --> 06:09:06.798 align:start position:0%
oftentimes in our federal reports to get
 
06:09:09.070 --> 06:09:09.080 align:start position:0%
the Federal grant you have to show a
 
06:09:11.430 --> 06:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
certain level of data you have to say we
 
06:09:14.990 --> 06:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
have x% of um pre-term births or we have
 
06:09:17.750 --> 06:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
x% of maternal mortality that's to even
 
06:09:19.628 --> 06:09:19.638 align:start position:0%
be considered for the funding to
 
06:09:21.670 --> 06:09:21.680 align:start position:0%
continue the funding we have to show
 
06:09:23.750 --> 06:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
evaluations did you make a difference
 
06:09:25.948 --> 06:09:25.958 align:start position:0%
and you have to use this data to make a
 
06:09:28.270 --> 06:09:28.280 align:start position:0%
difference to uh show that you've made a
 
06:09:29.628 --> 06:09:29.638 align:start position:0%
difference in order to continue the
 
06:09:32.390 --> 06:09:32.400 align:start position:0%
funding so it's a bit down the in the
 
06:09:34.830 --> 06:09:34.840 align:start position:0%
weeds but without it's fundamental if
 
06:09:37.350 --> 06:09:37.360 align:start position:0%
you don't have the data you don't get
 
06:09:38.830 --> 06:09:38.840 align:start position:0%
the money so I'm going to hand that over
 
06:09:41.788 --> 06:09:41.798 align:start position:0%
to Lisa can may I address one more thing
 
06:09:45.190 --> 06:09:45.200 align:start position:0%
regarding the uh data modernization so
 
06:09:48.390 --> 06:09:48.400 align:start position:0%
CDC uh recently not recently they have
 
06:09:50.030 --> 06:09:50.040 align:start position:0%
been pushing data modernization
 
06:09:52.868 --> 06:09:52.878 align:start position:0%
initiative to provide states fundings to
 
06:09:55.350 --> 06:09:55.360 align:start position:0%
modernize their data system V record
 
06:09:58.030 --> 06:09:58.040 align:start position:0%
statistic data system is one of the
 
06:09:59.990 --> 06:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
modernization however New Hampshire is
 
06:10:02.910 --> 06:10:02.920 align:start position:0%
the only state that the V statistic uh
 
06:10:06.190 --> 06:10:06.200 align:start position:0%
system is not on the DHHS so division of
 
06:10:08.510 --> 06:10:08.520 align:start position:0%
V records cannot receive this data
 
06:10:11.270 --> 06:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
modernization funding which is um about
 
06:10:15.110 --> 06:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
$2.7 million uh for two years and
 
06:10:17.868 --> 06:10:17.878 align:start position:0%
because of DHHS we are able to establish
 
06:10:21.468 --> 06:10:21.478 align:start position:0%
another number and other mou in order to
 
06:10:23.788 --> 06:10:23.798 align:start position:0%
um you know receive the funding and
 
06:10:26.030 --> 06:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
support uh division of V record
 
06:10:27.788 --> 06:10:27.798 align:start position:0%
Administration for their data
 
06:10:30.310 --> 06:10:30.320 align:start position:0%
modernization initiative I just want to
 
06:10:33.788 --> 06:10:33.798 align:start position:0%
emphasize that uh if there's a
 
06:10:37.150 --> 06:10:37.160 align:start position:0%
um a chance that the DJ just is not able
 
06:10:40.430 --> 06:10:40.440 align:start position:0%
to receive uh based on our statute uh
 
06:10:43.468 --> 06:10:43.478 align:start position:0%
direct and and tangable inch to use V
 
06:10:45.910 --> 06:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
record data this part of funding may be
 
06:10:45.920 --> 06:10:47.430 align:start position:0%
record data this part of funding may be
discontinued

06:10:47.430 --> 06:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
discontinued
 
06:10:50.830 --> 06:10:50.840 align:start position:0%
to yeah did you have a question I could
 
06:10:54.350 --> 06:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
yeah um so you I've seen seen this
 
06:10:56.310 --> 06:10:56.320 align:start position:0%
report you've talked about my question
 
06:10:56.320 --> 06:10:57.830 align:start position:0%
report you've talked about my question
is

06:10:57.830 --> 06:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:10:59.868 --> 06:10:59.878 align:start position:0%
why do you need the personal identified
 
06:11:03.150 --> 06:11:03.160 align:start position:0%
information to generate this why
 
06:11:07.150 --> 06:11:07.160 align:start position:0%
specifically yes whoever can answer yeah
 
06:11:09.468 --> 06:11:09.478 align:start position:0%
I can talk about the maternal one okay
 
06:11:11.868 --> 06:11:11.878 align:start position:0%
great pleas um hi good morning uh good
 
06:11:14.310 --> 06:11:14.320 align:start position:0%
afternoon my name is Lisa sarice I'm a
 
06:11:15.788 --> 06:11:15.798 align:start position:0%
bureau chief for family health and
 
06:11:17.548 --> 06:11:17.558 align:start position:0%
nutrition in public health and so my
 
06:11:19.430 --> 06:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
Bureau works very closely with chia's
 
06:11:21.990 --> 06:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
Bureau with the data and so I have the
 
06:11:24.030 --> 06:11:24.040 align:start position:0%
program folks Who oversee newborn
 
06:11:25.670 --> 06:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
screening so I'll speak to a little bit
 
06:11:27.390 --> 06:11:27.400 align:start position:0%
about what that work does as well as the
 
06:11:30.548 --> 06:11:30.558 align:start position:0%
maternal mortality program so they
 
06:11:32.430 --> 06:11:32.440 align:start position:0%
oversee the committee that does this
 
06:11:35.270 --> 06:11:35.280 align:start position:0%
work who who have generated that report
 
06:11:38.910 --> 06:11:38.920 align:start position:0%
so for example in order for our team to
 
06:11:41.990 --> 06:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
know the details of what maternal deaths
 
06:11:45.030 --> 06:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
happen in our state we utilize vital
 
06:11:47.510 --> 06:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
Vital Records to query that information
 
06:11:50.270 --> 06:11:50.280 align:start position:0%
so that we know what our recent maternal
 
06:11:52.468 --> 06:11:52.478 align:start position:0%
deaths were in a year in those who were
 
06:11:55.510 --> 06:11:55.520 align:start position:0%
pregnant so then under statute we have
 
06:11:58.190 --> 06:11:58.200 align:start position:0%
permission to then do chart abstractions
 
06:11:59.990 --> 06:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
to learn a little bit more about what
 
06:12:02.070 --> 06:12:02.080 align:start position:0%
some of the factors were associated with
 
06:12:04.390 --> 06:12:04.400 align:start position:0%
that death or with that woman and then
 
06:12:06.830 --> 06:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
we use that data to then allocate
 
06:12:09.350 --> 06:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
resources program funding to do that
 
06:12:12.150 --> 06:12:12.160 align:start position:0%
preventative work if I could inter so um
 
06:12:14.590 --> 06:12:14.600 align:start position:0%
is the issue that if you don't have the
 
06:12:18.190 --> 06:12:18.200 align:start position:0%
uh pii then you can't connect that to
 
06:12:20.670 --> 06:12:20.680 align:start position:0%
the Chart or other information okay
 
06:12:23.110 --> 06:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
thank you the other thing I'll just add
 
06:12:26.430 --> 06:12:26.440 align:start position:0%
to that is it also makes our overall dat
 
06:12:28.270 --> 06:12:28.280 align:start position:0%
data incomplete so again just
 
06:12:30.510 --> 06:12:30.520 align:start position:0%
prematurity rates teen birth rates all
 
06:12:33.390 --> 06:12:33.400 align:start position:0%
of that because with just uh aggregate
 
06:12:35.750 --> 06:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
numbers or non-statistical there may be
 
06:12:38.548 --> 06:12:38.558 align:start position:0%
four things that happen to a particular
 
06:12:40.628 --> 06:12:40.638 align:start position:0%
individual but that's going to look like
 
06:12:42.910 --> 06:12:42.920 align:start position:0%
perhaps four individuals that the math
 
06:12:45.230 --> 06:12:45.240 align:start position:0%
just won't work out correctly at the end
 
06:12:47.788 --> 06:12:47.798 align:start position:0%
of the day unless you can attach and
 
06:12:49.868 --> 06:12:49.878 align:start position:0%
again to the security point we have a
 
06:12:51.990 --> 06:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
very small handful of people who do this
 
06:12:54.270 --> 06:12:54.280 align:start position:0%
who do that data linkage and then drop
 
06:12:56.868 --> 06:12:56.878 align:start position:0%
the identifiers once the linkage happens
 
06:13:00.230 --> 06:13:00.240 align:start position:0%
quick followup if I could y so I
 
06:13:02.548 --> 06:13:02.558 align:start position:0%
mean I've been involved in some of this
 
06:13:05.350 --> 06:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
in Private Industry so couldn't you
 
06:13:07.868 --> 06:13:07.878 align:start position:0%
get um
 
06:13:09.670 --> 06:13:09.680 align:start position:0%
information I guess the question is
 
06:13:12.230 --> 06:13:12.240 align:start position:0%
could you get something that wasn't
 
06:13:15.590 --> 06:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
didn't have pii in it but you could
 
06:13:18.910 --> 06:13:18.920 align:start position:0%
somehow you know connect that the uh
 
06:13:20.468 --> 06:13:20.478 align:start position:0%
that these people are together but you
 
06:13:22.708 --> 06:13:22.718 align:start position:0%
don't know who they are so for some of
 
06:13:24.868 --> 06:13:24.878 align:start position:0%
our work that could work
 
06:13:26.910 --> 06:13:26.920 align:start position:0%
so potentially
 
06:13:28.708 --> 06:13:28.718 align:start position:0%
but then you have things like maternal
 
06:13:30.430 --> 06:13:30.440 align:start position:0%
mortality where you actually need the
 
06:13:32.830 --> 06:13:32.840 align:start position:0%
name in order to find that out newborn
 
06:13:34.510 --> 06:13:34.520 align:start position:0%
screening where you need the name
 
06:13:37.150 --> 06:13:37.160 align:start position:0%
there's other areas where you absolutely
 
06:13:39.468 --> 06:13:39.478 align:start position:0%
need the address because we know that
 
06:13:41.230 --> 06:13:41.240 align:start position:0%
there is a higher teen birth rate in
 
06:13:44.030 --> 06:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
Coos County than there is in conquered
 
06:13:46.948 --> 06:13:46.958 align:start position:0%
there are all the pii serves different
 
06:13:48.670 --> 06:13:48.680 align:start position:0%
function and then ultimately for the
 
06:13:50.628 --> 06:13:50.638 align:start position:0%
Human Services side of the house you
 
06:13:52.910 --> 06:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
need to be able to establish um
 
06:13:56.350 --> 06:13:56.360 align:start position:0%
paternity parentage um address
 
06:13:59.310 --> 06:13:59.320 align:start position:0%
citizenship and those all require names
 
06:14:02.030 --> 06:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
I can add on
 
06:14:05.948 --> 06:14:05.958 align:start position:0%
that sorry if I may yeah sorry so pii is
 
06:14:08.468 --> 06:14:08.478 align:start position:0%
not just about names we also use date of
 
06:14:10.948 --> 06:14:10.958 align:start position:0%
birth and also address for date of birth
 
06:14:14.430 --> 06:14:14.440 align:start position:0%
we calculate um the the mother's age and
 
06:14:17.030 --> 06:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
the father's age and also we also use
 
06:14:19.628 --> 06:14:19.638 align:start position:0%
date of death and date of birth to
 
06:14:22.750 --> 06:14:22.760 align:start position:0%
calculate a disase uh age sometimes this
 
06:14:25.030 --> 06:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
information is not really derived uh
 
06:14:28.830 --> 06:14:28.840 align:start position:0%
correctly in the uh V record uh data for
 
06:14:31.948 --> 06:14:31.958 align:start position:0%
example for newborn or fedal death uh
 
06:14:34.230 --> 06:14:34.240 align:start position:0%
they recorded as a month so it will be
 
06:14:37.110 --> 06:14:37.120 align:start position:0%
23 but the column we got is ear so we
 
06:14:39.310 --> 06:14:39.320 align:start position:0%
will if we don't have the date of birth
 
06:14:41.868 --> 06:14:41.878 align:start position:0%
and date of death which is part of pii
 
06:14:44.190 --> 06:14:44.200 align:start position:0%
to do the validation this part This
 
06:14:46.150 --> 06:14:46.160 align:start position:0%
Record will not be considered as a baby
 
06:14:48.948 --> 06:14:48.958 align:start position:0%
or newborn death so this a part of a pii
 
06:14:51.868 --> 06:14:51.878 align:start position:0%
that we we use to calculate age and
 
06:14:54.628 --> 06:14:54.638 align:start position:0%
other Pi that we use like address not
 
06:14:57.390 --> 06:14:57.400 align:start position:0%
only to do the uh the address validation
 
06:15:00.670 --> 06:15:00.680 align:start position:0%
we also use address to do G coding so
 
06:15:03.750 --> 06:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
the department uh over Public Health use
 
06:15:06.350 --> 06:15:06.360 align:start position:0%
address to Dr code into sensor track and
 
06:15:09.390 --> 06:15:09.400 align:start position:0%
sensor block for small area uh data
 
06:15:14.910 --> 06:15:14.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:17.030 --> 06:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
Outlook if I could I'll just share a
 
06:15:18.190 --> 06:15:18.200 align:start position:0%
little bit more about some of the
 
06:15:20.230 --> 06:15:20.240 align:start position:0%
Practical programming that we do when we
 
06:15:21.990 --> 06:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
utilize the vital records data so
 
06:15:24.190 --> 06:15:24.200 align:start position:0%
similar to the maternal mortality Review
 
06:15:25.910 --> 06:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
Committee we have a sudden death in the
 
06:15:27.990 --> 06:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
youth child fatality Review Committee
 
06:15:30.628 --> 06:15:30.638 align:start position:0%
which is also under statute and so the
 
06:15:32.670 --> 06:15:32.680 align:start position:0%
information that is accessed through the
 
06:15:35.150 --> 06:15:35.160 align:start position:0%
vital records also allows us to know
 
06:15:36.830 --> 06:15:36.840 align:start position:0%
which child deaths we had for the year
 
06:15:39.468 --> 06:15:39.478 align:start position:0%
so that we can similarly do chart
 
06:15:41.270 --> 06:15:41.280 align:start position:0%
abstraction um and it's important to
 
06:15:43.150 --> 06:15:43.160 align:start position:0%
know when these review committees are
 
06:15:45.190 --> 06:15:45.200 align:start position:0%
happening that that personal information
 
06:15:48.548 --> 06:15:48.558 align:start position:0%
is not shared with the group um another
 
06:15:50.910 --> 06:15:50.920 align:start position:0%
program that we have is our uh newborn
 
06:15:53.350 --> 06:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
screening programs and so we've heard a
 
06:15:56.190 --> 06:15:56.200 align:start position:0%
lot about those so there is statute that
 
06:15:58.628 --> 06:15:58.638 align:start position:0%
requires the hospitals to report to our
 
06:16:01.150 --> 06:16:01.160 align:start position:0%
newborn screening program however we use
 
06:16:03.750 --> 06:16:03.760 align:start position:0%
the vital records data to sort of be a
 
06:16:05.990 --> 06:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
safety net to make sure that no infant
 
06:16:08.830 --> 06:16:08.840 align:start position:0%
is missed in that process and so a query
 
06:16:12.310 --> 06:16:12.320 align:start position:0%
is done to make sure that those um blood
 
06:16:13.948 --> 06:16:13.958 align:start position:0%
spots happen that they come to the
 
06:16:15.468 --> 06:16:15.478 align:start position:0%
program and those families are followed
 
06:16:18.030 --> 06:16:18.040 align:start position:0%
up on um in a timely manner and not
 
06:16:19.868 --> 06:16:19.878 align:start position:0%
missed because we know that it's could
 
06:16:22.190 --> 06:16:22.200 align:start position:0%
be lifethreatening similarly to the
 
06:16:24.110 --> 06:16:24.120 align:start position:0%
blood spot we have a hearing detection
 
06:16:26.788 --> 06:16:26.798 align:start position:0%
program so similarly we use the vital
 
06:16:28.750 --> 06:16:28.760 align:start position:0%
records for that safety net to make sure
 
06:16:30.948 --> 06:16:30.958 align:start position:0%
that infants aren't missed for important
 
06:16:32.708 --> 06:16:32.718 align:start position:0%
screenings that happen in those few days
 
06:16:35.548 --> 06:16:35.558 align:start position:0%
after life we have the birth conditions
 
06:16:38.270 --> 06:16:38.280 align:start position:0%
program that we oversee that also we
 
06:16:40.948 --> 06:16:40.958 align:start position:0%
utilize that pii information and vital
 
06:16:43.590 --> 06:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
records and then we have a pregnancy
 
06:16:46.468 --> 06:16:46.478 align:start position:0%
risk assessment U System a survey system
 
06:16:49.670 --> 06:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
where we pull a sample of women who
 
06:16:51.628 --> 06:16:51.638 align:start position:0%
recently were pregnant and then we
 
06:16:53.310 --> 06:16:53.320 align:start position:0%
follow up with a survey to learn a
 
06:16:54.390 --> 06:16:54.400 align:start position:0%
little bit more about what their
 
06:16:56.190 --> 06:16:56.200 align:start position:0%
birthing experience was like through
 
06:16:59.510 --> 06:16:59.520 align:start position:0%
their healthare providers um and so we
 
06:17:02.350 --> 06:17:02.360 align:start position:0%
use that information to then do program
 
06:17:05.230 --> 06:17:05.240 align:start position:0%
planning resource allotment so that we
 
06:17:07.070 --> 06:17:07.080 align:start position:0%
can put preventative and treatment
 
06:17:08.948 --> 06:17:08.958 align:start position:0%
programs out into the community in the
 
06:17:11.230 --> 06:17:11.240 align:start position:0%
areas that need them
 
06:17:13.910 --> 06:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
most I think that's good um and with
 
06:17:15.310 --> 06:17:15.320 align:start position:0%
your Indulgence we'll we'll try and get
 
06:17:17.670 --> 06:17:17.680 align:start position:0%
somebody else up here too unless there
 
06:17:21.110 --> 06:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
question nope I'm going the questions I
 
06:17:23.910 --> 06:17:23.920 align:start position:0%
just we just have to leave in
 
06:17:28.230 --> 06:17:28.240 align:start position:0%
like let's say 10 okay so um I will let
 
06:17:30.590 --> 06:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
the economic supports people decide
 
06:17:32.830 --> 06:17:32.840 align:start position:0%
amongst themselves who would like to be
 
06:17:34.468 --> 06:17:34.478 align:start position:0%
representative of the group whether it's
 
06:17:37.070 --> 06:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
the child care folks or tan or whatever
 
06:17:39.270 --> 06:17:39.280 align:start position:0%
because I think similarly I think
 
06:17:42.190 --> 06:17:42.200 align:start position:0%
similarly they all use the information
 
06:17:44.708 --> 06:17:44.718 align:start position:0%
to do things like establishing parentage
 
06:17:46.628 --> 06:17:46.638 align:start position:0%
to ensure that economic supports are
 
06:17:49.070 --> 06:17:49.080 align:start position:0%
available to New Hampshire residents so
 
06:17:54.910 --> 06:17:54.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:54.920 --> 06:17:58.070 align:start position:0%
 
up

06:17:58.070 --> 06:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:01.430 --> 06:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
good afternoon um Madam chair and um
 
06:18:03.670 --> 06:18:03.680 align:start position:0%
members of the committee uh for the
 
06:18:09.190 --> 06:18:09.200 align:start position:0%
record my name is Lisa decowski D Kut
 
06:18:12.350 --> 06:18:12.360 align:start position:0%
oi I'm the bureau chief with the Bureau
 
06:18:16.110 --> 06:18:16.120 align:start position:0%
of Child Support Services so our program
 
06:18:18.230 --> 06:18:18.240 align:start position:0%
under the department administers the
 
06:18:21.390 --> 06:18:21.400 align:start position:0%
child support program um of course our
 
06:18:25.270 --> 06:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
program is a federal state um and tribal
 
06:18:27.230 --> 06:18:27.240 align:start position:0%
partnership program that was established
 
06:18:30.910 --> 06:18:30.920 align:start position:0%
by the Social Security Act uh part title
 
06:18:35.230 --> 06:18:35.240 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral 4D um and naturally our
 
06:18:37.110 --> 06:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
program seeks to promote economic
 
06:18:39.868 --> 06:18:39.878 align:start position:0%
stability and as it is already uh stated
 
06:18:42.310 --> 06:18:42.320 align:start position:0%
one of the primary functions of our
 
06:18:46.230 --> 06:18:46.240 align:start position:0%
program is to establish legal parentage
 
06:18:49.190 --> 06:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
and legal paternity specifically legal
 
06:18:52.990 --> 06:18:53.000 align:start position:0%
fatherhood as well as locating parents
 
06:18:56.190 --> 06:18:56.200 align:start position:0%
for families and establishing legal Ord
 
06:19:00.110 --> 06:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
of child support and medical support uh
 
06:19:04.030 --> 06:19:04.040 align:start position:0%
for our um customers so the Bureau of
 
06:19:08.670 --> 06:19:08.680 align:start position:0%
Child Support Services um uh as a
 
06:19:12.670 --> 06:19:12.680 align:start position:0%
federally um you know uh uh invested
 
06:19:15.670 --> 06:19:15.680 align:start position:0%
program uh certainly has a direct and
 
06:19:17.788 --> 06:19:17.798 align:start position:0%
tangible interest in accessing the vital
 
06:19:19.910 --> 06:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
records information for our program to
 
06:19:23.830 --> 06:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
be able to execute our uh child support
 
06:19:26.510 --> 06:19:26.520 align:start position:0%
responsibilities um as it has already
 
06:19:30.230 --> 06:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
stated you know we also follow the same
 
06:19:32.030 --> 06:19:32.040 align:start position:0%
uh stringent state and federal
 
06:19:34.150 --> 06:19:34.160 align:start position:0%
safeguarding and confidentiality
 
06:19:37.390 --> 06:19:37.400 align:start position:0%
requirements um but because one of our
 
06:19:39.670 --> 06:19:39.680 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of the department is to
 
06:19:41.910 --> 06:19:41.920 align:start position:0%
establish the legal parentage access to
 
06:19:43.990 --> 06:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
that vital records information is
 
06:19:46.468 --> 06:19:46.478 align:start position:0%
actually specified within the federal
 
06:19:48.788 --> 06:19:48.798 align:start position:0%
law of the Social Security Act of our
 
06:19:50.708 --> 06:19:50.718 align:start position:0%
part D which I believe had already been
 
06:19:54.190 --> 06:19:54.200 align:start position:0%
stated in prior testimony um and often
 
06:19:57.948 --> 06:19:57.958 align:start position:0%
times um there are a variety of areas
 
06:20:01.468 --> 06:20:01.478 align:start position:0%
that our program um is intertwined with
 
06:20:04.830 --> 06:20:04.840 align:start position:0%
the work of Vital Records um and so if
 
06:20:07.628 --> 06:20:07.638 align:start position:0%
we were not to have access to these
 
06:20:09.750 --> 06:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
personal identifiers um and the
 
06:20:11.628 --> 06:20:11.638 align:start position:0%
information we would not be able to
 
06:20:14.830 --> 06:20:14.840 align:start position:0%
execute our program um it would be very
 
06:20:16.430 --> 06:20:16.440 align:start position:0%
difficult for us to establish child
 
06:20:19.310 --> 06:20:19.320 align:start position:0%
support for families establish parentage
 
06:20:21.990 --> 06:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
um and so it would be very difficult for
 
06:20:24.990 --> 06:20:25.000 align:start position:0%
us to assist and locate um functions
 
06:20:26.468 --> 06:20:26.478 align:start position:0%
both for the Department department for
 
06:20:28.510 --> 06:20:28.520 align:start position:0%
locate investigations things of that
 
06:20:31.110 --> 06:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
nature that we are allowed to do Under
 
06:20:33.830 --> 06:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
the Social Security Act of the child
 
06:20:36.948 --> 06:20:36.958 align:start position:0%
support program um and you
 
06:20:39.548 --> 06:20:39.558 align:start position:0%
know the birth certificate the birth
 
06:20:42.150 --> 06:20:42.160 align:start position:0%
record is is a one of the most widely
 
06:20:45.468 --> 06:20:45.478 align:start position:0%
used documents that we use um there and
 
06:20:47.390 --> 06:20:47.400 align:start position:0%
so it would be essential for us to
 
06:20:49.150 --> 06:20:49.160 align:start position:0%
continue to be able to have that for our
 
06:20:52.150 --> 06:20:52.160 align:start position:0%
program to run um you know our program
 
06:20:55.030 --> 06:20:55.040 align:start position:0%
Services about 30,000 families in the
 
06:20:57.190 --> 06:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
child uh in New Hampshire currently but
 
06:20:59.910 --> 06:20:59.920 align:start position:0%
we also service U folks out of state as
 
06:21:01.990 --> 06:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
well as internationally and tribal
 
06:21:04.628 --> 06:21:04.638 align:start position:0%
communities um our program brings uh
 
06:21:06.708 --> 06:21:06.718 align:start position:0%
collects money for families roughly
 
06:21:09.350 --> 06:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
about $74 million on the last Federal
 
06:21:11.070 --> 06:21:11.080 align:start position:0%
fiscal year that we've distributed for
 
06:21:13.628 --> 06:21:13.638 align:start position:0%
collections to families so our work is
 
06:21:17.230 --> 06:21:17.240 align:start position:0%
really power Mount um but our program is
 
06:21:20.548 --> 06:21:20.558 align:start position:0%
um our state plan under our state plan
 
06:21:22.628 --> 06:21:22.638 align:start position:0%
the Department's child support program
 
06:21:24.510 --> 06:21:24.520 align:start position:0%
is federally funded and we're federally
 
06:21:27.350 --> 06:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
funded at a rate of 6 6 6% so we are
 
06:21:29.670 --> 06:21:29.680 align:start position:0%
conditioned on ensuring that we are in
 
06:21:31.750 --> 06:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
full compliance with all of our federal
 
06:21:33.910 --> 06:21:33.920 align:start position:0%
requirements to be able to administer
 
06:21:36.390 --> 06:21:36.400 align:start position:0%
our program and the concern here would
 
06:21:39.190 --> 06:21:39.200 align:start position:0%
be that um if if we were not allowed to
 
06:21:41.230 --> 06:21:41.240 align:start position:0%
have the per personal identifiers we
 
06:21:43.430 --> 06:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
would be at risk of violation of those
 
06:21:46.030 --> 06:21:46.040 align:start position:0%
um Federal requirements to be able to
 
06:21:47.830 --> 06:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
perform our duties and there would be
 
06:21:49.830 --> 06:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
significant loss of federal funding so
 
06:21:53.708 --> 06:21:53.718 align:start position:0%
we would not be able to um um have a
 
06:21:56.150 --> 06:21:56.160 align:start position:0%
program here for the child support uh
 
06:21:58.310 --> 06:21:58.320 align:start position:0%
recipients that we serve in New
 
06:22:01.548 --> 06:22:01.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um I am certainly available to
 
06:22:03.110 --> 06:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
answer or ask any questions I know we're
 
06:22:05.708 --> 06:22:05.718 align:start position:0%
under a time straint but um if you have
 
06:22:07.468 --> 06:22:07.478 align:start position:0%
any specific questions I'd be happy to
 
06:22:07.478 --> 06:22:10.430 align:start position:0%
any specific questions I'd be happy to
answer

06:22:10.430 --> 06:22:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:15.070 --> 06:22:15.080 align:start position:0%
them I do have a recommendation to the
 
06:22:17.830 --> 06:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
subcommittee which consists of
 
06:22:20.750 --> 06:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
myself um representative Fitzpatrick
 
06:22:24.548 --> 06:22:24.558 align:start position:0%
representative mipi and representative
 
06:22:28.110 --> 06:22:28.120 align:start position:0%
Maguire because this is a very
 
06:22:31.548 --> 06:22:31.558 align:start position:0%
complicated issue and doesn't seem to be
 
06:22:34.750 --> 06:22:34.760 align:start position:0%
one that is going to go
 
06:22:38.070 --> 06:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
away I'm I would like to make a Rec
 
06:22:40.110 --> 06:22:40.120 align:start position:0%
recommendation to the subcommittee that
 
06:22:42.990 --> 06:22:43.000 align:start position:0%
we recommend to our committee interim
 
06:22:46.548 --> 06:22:46.558 align:start position:0%
study on this bill that way we can
 
06:22:48.350 --> 06:22:48.360 align:start position:0%
discuss it in more detail over the
 
06:22:51.750 --> 06:22:51.760 align:start position:0%
summer and we can address this once and
 
06:22:54.468 --> 06:22:54.478 align:start position:0%
for all does that make sense with the
 
06:22:54.478 --> 06:22:57.670 align:start position:0%
for all does that make sense with the
subcommittee

06:22:57.670 --> 06:22:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:00.310 --> 06:23:00.320 align:start position:0%
I support that yes it makes a great deal
 
06:23:03.670 --> 06:23:03.680 align:start position:0%
of sense yes because the more we hear
 
06:23:05.390 --> 06:23:05.400 align:start position:0%
about it the more
 
06:23:09.110 --> 06:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
pieces pop up that need to be changed
 
06:23:13.070 --> 06:23:13.080 align:start position:0%
and I don't want to take a meex to a
 
06:23:16.310 --> 06:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
system that seems to be
 
06:23:18.990 --> 06:23:19.000 align:start position:0%
working but on the other hand I do want
 
06:23:21.910 --> 06:23:21.920 align:start position:0%
to continue to implement priv our
 
06:23:24.990 --> 06:23:25.000 align:start position:0%
privacy protections and but this is not
 
06:23:25.000 --> 06:23:26.230 align:start position:0%
privacy protections and but this is not
a

06:23:26.230 --> 06:23:26.240 align:start position:0%
a
 
06:23:28.030 --> 06:23:28.040 align:start position:0%
a a simple
 
06:23:31.110 --> 06:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
issue if nothing else the testimony at
 
06:23:31.120 --> 06:23:32.190 align:start position:0%
issue if nothing else the testimony at
the

06:23:32.190 --> 06:23:32.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:23:35.948 --> 06:23:35.958 align:start position:0%
first what we we heard before the full
 
06:23:38.070 --> 06:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
committee was that there's a whole lot
 
06:23:41.070 --> 06:23:41.080 align:start position:0%
of other rsas that are affected by this
 
06:23:43.190 --> 06:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
process that would need to be changed
 
06:23:46.030 --> 06:23:46.040 align:start position:0%
it's not just what's in the bill we'd
 
06:23:48.670 --> 06:23:48.680 align:start position:0%
have to go through a whole lot of other
 
06:23:51.310 --> 06:23:51.320 align:start position:0%
areas to make sure we weren't creating
 
06:23:53.350 --> 06:23:53.360 align:start position:0%
conflicts and I don't think we can do
 
06:23:56.670 --> 06:23:56.680 align:start position:0%
that in the time available
 
06:23:59.390 --> 06:23:59.400 align:start position:0%
just for attenders knowledge I'm not on
 
06:24:01.990 --> 06:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee so I'm not being asked
 
06:24:06.750 --> 06:24:06.760 align:start position:0%
my opinions but I share the the opinions
 
06:24:08.548 --> 06:24:08.558 align:start position:0%
that were expressed by my
 
06:24:12.750 --> 06:24:12.760 align:start position:0%
colleagues so I'll move um interm study
 
06:24:16.190 --> 06:24:16.200 align:start position:0%
