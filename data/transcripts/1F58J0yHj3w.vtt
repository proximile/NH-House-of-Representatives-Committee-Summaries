would you please lead us in the Pledge
 
00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:11.479 align:start position:0%

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
morning allegiance to the flag of the
 
00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:22.240 align:start position:0%
United States of America and to the
 
00:06:25.469 --> 00:06:25.479 align:start position:0%
Republic for which it stands one nation
 
00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:28.680 align:start position:0%
under God indivisible with liberty and
 
00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:36.749 --> 00:06:36.759 align:start position:0%
thank you we're gonna begin this morning
 
00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:39.280 align:start position:0%
with a work session on Two
 
00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:43.919 align:start position:0%
Bills um I know we're waiting on
 
00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:49.160 align:start position:0%
some uh final draft of the uh Amendment
 
00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:52.000 align:start position:0%
for the architectural paint recycling so
 
00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:56.120 align:start position:0%
why don't we talk about HB 1698 first
 
00:06:59.589 --> 00:06:59.599 align:start position:0%
which is um relative to the use of
 
00:07:02.189 --> 00:07:02.199 align:start position:0%
drones for the aerial application of
 
00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:05.000 align:start position:0%
pesticides um I did have a copy of the
 
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
amendment um on the table there if
 
00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
you're if you'd like it um but basically
 
00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:13.120 align:start position:0%
what this amendment
 
00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:15.360 align:start position:0%
does uh different than the amendment
 
00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
that I presented when I brought the bill
 
00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
to the committee last week is that now I
 
00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:26.240 align:start position:0%
am pointing uh to on line five uh as you
 
00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:29.560 align:start position:0%
have a copy in front of you uh that un
 
00:07:33.469 --> 00:07:33.479 align:start position:0%
and aircraft as defined in RSA 422 colon
 
00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:39.080 align:start position:0%
3 Roman numeral 30 and that one as
 
00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:41.000 align:start position:0%
opposed to the one that I had before
 
00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
which was I think
 
00:07:45.469 --> 00:07:45.479 align:start position:0%
27 um points to the definition of
 
00:07:48.309 --> 00:07:48.319 align:start position:0%
unmanned aircraft as opposed to small
 
00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:51.080 align:start position:0%
unmanned aircraft uh the definition the
 
00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
federal definition of small unmanned
 
00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
aircraft had a um a weight limit of 55
 
00:08:01.749 --> 00:08:01.759 align:start position:0%
pounds and I believe some of these um
 
00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:04.960 align:start position:0%
drones that spray pesticides on crops
 
00:08:08.869 --> 00:08:08.879 align:start position:0%
are a little bit heavier than that so uh
 
00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:11.720 align:start position:0%
so as not to have a
 
00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:16.280 align:start position:0%
problem um I I am now pointing it to the
 
00:08:18.629 --> 00:08:18.639 align:start position:0%
correct RSA as well as Federal
 
00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:21.280 align:start position:0%
definition for unmanned space uh
 
00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:22.390 align:start position:0%
definition for unmanned space uh
spacecraft

00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:22.400 align:start position:0%
spacecraft
 
00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:25.120 align:start position:0%
aircraft and
 
00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:29.680 align:start position:0%
um so the this amendment to the original
 
00:08:33.829 --> 00:08:33.839 align:start position:0%
Bill also um makes that that spraying
 
00:08:37.269 --> 00:08:37.279 align:start position:0%
cannot happen above 20 ft above ground
 
00:08:41.310 --> 00:08:41.320 align:start position:0%
level so uh and I checked with the uh
 
00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:44.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Farm Bureau and also the
 
00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:46.480 align:start position:0%
agriculture commissioner and everybody
 
00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:49.480 align:start position:0%
was all okay with that so this is the
 
00:08:52.269 --> 00:08:52.279 align:start position:0%
amendment that I would be uh presenting
 
00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:55.160 align:start position:0%
this afternoon when we exec the
 
00:08:58.230 --> 00:08:58.240 align:start position:0%
bill I'm sorry this morning yes this
 
00:09:00.269 --> 00:09:00.279 align:start position:0%
morning hopefully we'll be done done by
 
00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:04.480 align:start position:0%
noon we can get out of here um you have
 
00:09:06.949 --> 00:09:06.959 align:start position:0%
a comment representing kraton yeah yes
 
00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:09.640 align:start position:0%
ma'am um I read through the amendment
 
00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:12.240 align:start position:0%
and answered
 
00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
uh three of my questions the first was
 
00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
uh bringing it down to 20 feet and
 
00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:20.069 align:start position:0%
uh bringing it down to 20 feet and
spraying

00:09:20.069 --> 00:09:20.079 align:start position:0%
spraying
 
00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
down uh created actually less of a
 
00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
footprint from a blowing perspective
 
00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
than spraying up from the ground so
 
00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:30.680 align:start position:0%
those two
 
00:09:38.069 --> 00:09:38.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:40.800 align:start position:0%
uh yeah and then the the third one was
 
00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:42.560 align:start position:0%
just the weight they said they weigh up
 
00:09:44.829 --> 00:09:44.839 align:start position:0%
to 400 pounds and this this accomplishes
 
00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:47.360 align:start position:0%
that so I'm I'm good with this uh with
 
00:09:49.509 --> 00:09:49.519 align:start position:0%
this bill with this amendment over
 
00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:54.440 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby so um the uh there
 
00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:57.440 align:start position:0%
was a person who was supposed to uh who
 
00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:00.720 align:start position:0%
who is uh in the business of uh doing
 
00:10:03.069 --> 00:10:03.079 align:start position:0%
contract spraying with drones uh from
 
00:10:06.389 --> 00:10:06.399 align:start position:0%
New York State who is going to uh be
 
00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
with us for our hearing last week but
 
00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:12.440 align:start position:0%
got called back for a family emergency
 
00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
uh so wasn't able to join us he did send
 
00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:18.240 align:start position:0%
a letter and uh he indicated that the
 
00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:20.800 align:start position:0%
changes that uh this current amendment
 
00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:24.360 align:start position:0%
makes uh resolve all the issues that um
 
00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:28.360 align:start position:0%
that he saw in terms of being able to um
 
00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:32.440 align:start position:0%
get the proper permit in and uh uh and
 
00:10:36.389 --> 00:10:36.399 align:start position:0%
to do the spraying in New Hampshire and
 
00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
uh so I think that it's important to
 
00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
know that the the people in the industry
 
00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:42.240 align:start position:0%
feel that this is an appropriate
 
00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh I would second uh what
 
00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
representative kraton said about uh this
 
00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:50.680 align:start position:0%
being uh the the Drone spraying being a
 
00:10:52.949 --> 00:10:52.959 align:start position:0%
lower impact method of applying
 
00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
pesticides than ground spraying uh
 
00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:00.720 align:start position:0%
because uh it can be uh um more targeted
 
00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
and it uh because the propellers
 
00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:06.680 align:start position:0%
actually drive this the uh the spray
 
00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:10.880 align:start position:0%
downward uh it it reduces the uh level
 
00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:14.200 align:start position:0%
of drift uh in a way that you don't that
 
00:11:15.949 --> 00:11:15.959 align:start position:0%
would be below what you get with a a
 
00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
ground spraying rig representative ktoa
 
00:11:21.949 --> 00:11:21.959 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um I believe that
 
00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:24.760 align:start position:0%
this is a must pass bill for
 
00:11:27.389 --> 00:11:27.399 align:start position:0%
agriculture um and as everyone said the
 
00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:31.880 align:start position:0%
20 foot uh height is sufficient um the
 
00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:34.040 align:start position:0%
other thing is is when you're down
 
00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:35.680 align:start position:0%
spraying you're actually getting into
 
00:11:38.949 --> 00:11:38.959 align:start position:0%
the plants better to better uh get
 
00:11:40.069 --> 00:11:40.079 align:start position:0%
better uh
 
00:11:43.269 --> 00:11:43.279 align:start position:0%
coverage um and this will actually help
 
00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
agriculture across the state uh because
 
00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:48.240 align:start position:0%
it'll help with reducing uh Capital
 
00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:52.440 align:start position:0%
costs and um being able to Target things
 
00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:53.800 align:start position:0%
a little bit better instead of just
 
00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:56.240 align:start position:0%
doing an overspray of areas that don't
 
00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:57.790 align:start position:0%
doing an overspray of areas that don't
need

00:11:57.790 --> 00:11:57.800 align:start position:0%
need
 
00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:00.360 align:start position:0%
it represent
 
00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:02.399 align:start position:0%
ger thank you madam chair and I also
 
00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:05.560 align:start position:0%
wanted to uh say I fully support this
 
00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:08.240 align:start position:0%
bill I appreciate Madam chair's uh
 
00:12:11.389 --> 00:12:11.399 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh originally I it heard as I
 
00:12:13.389 --> 00:12:13.399 align:start position:0%
think some of us did from from
 
00:12:15.389 --> 00:12:15.399 align:start position:0%
beekeepers who had concerns but I was
 
00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
glad to hear in the testimony uh that
 
00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:19.800 align:start position:0%
the the issue around the neonix I guess
 
00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:21.320 align:start position:0%
is what it's called right that that
 
00:12:23.189 --> 00:12:23.199 align:start position:0%
isn't an issue we're talking about here
 
00:12:25.389 --> 00:12:25.399 align:start position:0%
anyway but especially with the amendment
 
00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
uh that Madam chair has offered to
 
00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:29.320 align:start position:0%
reduce the height from 50 to 20 feet I
 
00:12:32.389 --> 00:12:32.399 align:start position:0%
think um makes this an even better bill
 
00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
it's important for our Farmers so I
 
00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:36.600 align:start position:0%
definitely fully support the direction
 
00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:38.480 align:start position:0%
it's going in
 
00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:41.160 align:start position:0%
okay all right any other discussion
 
00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:44.240 align:start position:0%
about the amendment or this bill or okay
 
00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
I think we're good with that um so next
 
00:12:52.509 --> 00:12:52.519 align:start position:0%
on our um discussion list this morning
 
00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:55.880 align:start position:0%
for our work session is
 
00:12:57.550 --> 00:12:57.560 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:00.360 align:start position:0%
1504 relative to architectural paint
 
00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
recycling and I believe there is an
 
00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
amendment uh on being printed as we
 
00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:08.920 align:start position:0%
speak and I'd like uh representative

has the ability to uh address some of
 
00:13:29.629 --> 00:13:29.639 align:start position:0%
the concerns that this this
 
00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:32.240 align:start position:0%
subcommittee yes I can give you copies

so does anyone else need this
 
00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
preliminary draft I believe I gave it to
 
00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
representative Kenny
 
00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
yes um do you have another one yes of
 
00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:53.629 align:start position:0%
 
that

00:13:53.629 --> 00:13:53.639 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:56.160 align:start position:0%
okay sorry about that Madam sure go
 
00:13:57.790 --> 00:13:57.800 align:start position:0%
right ahead I'm sorry to interrupt no
 
00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
that was my my F so um when we're
 
00:14:03.629 --> 00:14:03.639 align:start position:0%
looking at the program I took into
 
00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:05.800 align:start position:0%
consideration the subcommittee's um
 
00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
thoughts and listened very intently I
 
00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:10.680 align:start position:0%
know that this this body has had a a lot
 
00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:13.680 align:start position:0%
of um focus and energy on this program
 
00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:15.240 align:start position:0%
and wanting to make sure that we had
 
00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:18.120 align:start position:0%
something that we felt could stand up um
 
00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:21.240 align:start position:0%
to any sort of entity that comes uh
 
00:14:23.189 --> 00:14:23.199 align:start position:0%
through an RFP process and seeks to
 
00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
standup uh recycling stewardship program
 
00:14:29.189 --> 00:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
so I wanted to take folks through um
 
00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:32.240 align:start position:0%
generally the organization of it um the
 
00:14:34.269 --> 00:14:34.279 align:start position:0%
paint stewardship program starts to
 
00:14:38.069 --> 00:14:38.079 align:start position:0%
Define things through 149 M um one of
 
00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:41.720 align:start position:0%
the pieces of information that is on
 
00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
page I believe it's five if we're
 
00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:46.440 align:start position:0%
looking at things it's
 
00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:49.560 align:start position:0%
uh starts with let me double since I
 
00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:53.800 align:start position:0%
don't have it two one two three four yes
 
00:14:58.389 --> 00:14:58.399 align:start position:0%
five um we have 149 M proposals to
 
00:15:00.389 --> 00:15:00.399 align:start position:0%
establish a p stewardship program at the
 
00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
very bottom um section one it says any
 
00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:05.320 align:start position:0%
producer representative organization
 
00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
that wishes to become a stewardship
 
00:15:13.629 --> 00:15:13.639 align:start position:0%
organization shall um by um January 1
 
00:15:16.949 --> 00:15:16.959 align:start position:0%
2024 thank you five submit a plan for
 
00:15:18.389 --> 00:15:18.399 align:start position:0%
the establishment of paint stewardship
 
00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:20.240 align:start position:0%
program for the Department for approval
 
00:15:21.629 --> 00:15:21.639 align:start position:0%
together with a non-refundable
 
00:15:24.389 --> 00:15:24.399 align:start position:0%
application fee specified in paragraph
 
00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
three below and also establish rules I
 
00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
have stitched together various iter
 
00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
ations of the bill and some of them had
 
00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:34.160 align:start position:0%
an initial application fee listed inside
 
00:15:36.069 --> 00:15:36.079 align:start position:0%
the text of the bill but I felt like
 
00:15:38.309 --> 00:15:38.319 align:start position:0%
that was a better conversation for rules
 
00:15:41.749 --> 00:15:41.759 align:start position:0%
to establish the fee structure um we had
 
00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:43.120 align:start position:0%
talked about that we've seen that in
 
00:15:46.069 --> 00:15:46.079 align:start position:0%
many other circumstances where um rules
 
00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:48.680 align:start position:0%
establishes those types of fees on the
 
00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:51.440 align:start position:0%
very next page at the top in um section
 
00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:54.160 align:start position:0%
two um this talks about a retailer or
 
00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
political subdivision and that was this
 
00:15:57.910 --> 00:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
was our conversation on the Maze and the
 
00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
shs about participation versus
 
00:16:02.949 --> 00:16:02.959 align:start position:0%
collecting a fee and what our our
 
00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:05.880 align:start position:0%
general consensus was and um the
 
00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:07.360 align:start position:0%
statement says that a retailer or
 
00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:09.800 align:start position:0%
political sub uh subdivision May
 
00:16:11.829 --> 00:16:11.839 align:start position:0%
participate in being a collection site
 
00:16:13.629 --> 00:16:13.639 align:start position:0%
but paint manufacturers shall
 
00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
participate in the paint stewardship
 
00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:17.600 align:start position:0%
program and fees Associated uh within
 
00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire to ensure the
 
00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:20.920 align:start position:0%
paint stewardship program remains viable
 
00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:23.480 align:start position:0%
for years to come so in the event that
 
00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:26.120 align:start position:0%
they do not want to be a collection site
 
00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:28.120 align:start position:0%
they if they sell certain brands of
 
00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
paint they still still must collect um
 
00:16:34.269 --> 00:16:34.279 align:start position:0%
through the manufacturers um fees that
 
00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:37.000 align:start position:0%
are established on the paint prior to
 
00:16:39.509 --> 00:16:39.519 align:start position:0%
sale that still must be collected to
 
00:16:42.389 --> 00:16:42.399 align:start position:0%
ensure that when folks are then going to
 
00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:44.480 align:start position:0%
any other site that is available that
 
00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:47.240 align:start position:0%
that money is there for the program to
 
00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:50.120 align:start position:0%
run um then just a little bit further
 
00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
down under that section it also talks
 
00:16:56.749 --> 00:16:56.759 align:start position:0%
about um a radius um 25 miles seemed to
 
00:16:58.590 --> 00:16:58.600 align:start position:0%
be the conversation that we were having
 
00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:01.000 align:start position:0%
around around um a permanent collection
 
00:17:03.269 --> 00:17:03.279 align:start position:0%
Point whether it's a municipality that
 
00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:05.360 align:start position:0%
stands one up or a retailer that stands
 
00:17:07.549 --> 00:17:07.559 align:start position:0%
one up there should be one within a 25
 
00:17:09.909 --> 00:17:09.919 align:start position:0%
mile radius throughout the
 
00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
state the next page on subsection
 
00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:17.000 align:start position:0%
four um at the very top says that a
 
00:17:18.949 --> 00:17:18.959 align:start position:0%
non-refundable application fee shall be
 
00:17:20.590 --> 00:17:20.600 align:start position:0%
paid by the applicant to review the
 
00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:22.280 align:start position:0%
paint stewardship plan again it just
 
00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
Reen numerates the fact that the fee
 
00:17:27.309 --> 00:17:27.319 align:start position:0%
structure should be determined in
 
00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
rules um
 
00:17:33.549 --> 00:17:33.559 align:start position:0%
the very next page we talk about um 1A
 
00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:36.360 align:start position:0%
where it starts with the text the
 
00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
original assessment shall not uh shall
 
00:17:43.029 --> 00:17:43.039 align:start position:0%
shall not be more than $3.50 for cans
 
00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:45.240 align:start position:0%
above one gallon and no less than 75
 
00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:47.000 align:start position:0%
cents for quantities less than or equal
 
00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
to one pint so this was addressing some
 
00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:52.400 align:start position:0%
of the conversation around um fee
 
00:17:55.149 --> 00:17:55.159 align:start position:0%
structures being um adjusted in other
 
00:17:59.470 --> 00:17:59.480 align:start position:0%
states I will also note that in uh
 
00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:01.400 align:start position:0%
within this bill we also have a
 
00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:03.240 align:start position:0%
requirement that annually the fee
 
00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
structure should be Revisited so that we
 
00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:08.120 align:start position:0%
do not have a circumstance that comes
 
00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:11.000 align:start position:0%
upon us where um we need to do that
 
00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:12.280 align:start position:0%
because the fees had not been
 
00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:14.320 align:start position:0%
re-evaluated in some time or anything
 
00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:17.720 align:start position:0%
like that so every year um that fee
 
00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
structure should get looked at to make
 
00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:21.080 align:start position:0%
sure that that is keeping up with what
 
00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:23.110 align:start position:0%
sure that that is keeping up with what
is

00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:18:25.390 --> 00:18:25.400 align:start position:0%
necessary uh the next page I don't
 
00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:36.600 align:start position:0%
note H same with the following page and
 
00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:40.400 align:start position:0%
then we go to
 
00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:44.280 align:start position:0%
um two pages uh afterwards it says where
 
00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:46.240 align:start position:0%
Financial Assurance is required there's
 
00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:49.360 align:start position:0%
a subsection six above that I don't know
 
00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:52.840 align:start position:0%
if folks are there um paint received at
 
00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:54.320 align:start position:0%
a collection location shall be
 
00:18:56.029 --> 00:18:56.039 align:start position:0%
considered universal waste this is
 
00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:57.280 align:start position:0%
something that we heard from the
 
00:18:59.710 --> 00:18:59.720 align:start position:0%
Department that they had concerned over
 
00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
hazardous waste um versus universal
 
00:19:06.789 --> 00:19:06.799 align:start position:0%
waste and um I think I have the correct
 
00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:09.320 align:start position:0%
um environmental statute there and it
 
00:19:11.149 --> 00:19:11.159 align:start position:0%
says nothing in this section shall
 
00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:13.400 align:start position:0%
otherwise reclassify paint as uh
 
00:19:15.549 --> 00:19:15.559 align:start position:0%
Universal waste elsewhere in the statute
 
00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:17.720 align:start position:0%
this strictly applies to the re the
 
00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:20.720 align:start position:0%
places that receive the paint uh for
 
00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:24.280 align:start position:0%
drop off locations anything else um
 
00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:27.440 align:start position:0%
would stay as it should be um with the
 
00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:29.440 align:start position:0%
classifications for hazardous waste
 
00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:31.070 align:start position:0%
classifications for hazardous waste
materials

00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
materials
 
00:19:34.549 --> 00:19:34.559 align:start position:0%
um the following page there's nothing of
 
00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:38.200 align:start position:0%
major consideration um
 
00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
that we didn't really discuss I the
 
00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:43.360 align:start position:0%
other portion of this conversation I
 
00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:45.640 align:start position:0%
think we had just wanted to make sure
 
00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
that if for some reason an entity seeks
 
00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:52.440 align:start position:0%
to exist any longer and is no longer
 
00:19:56.350 --> 00:19:56.360 align:start position:0%
um operating under uh the program that
 
00:19:59.070 --> 00:19:59.080 align:start position:0%
there is an opportunity that um um there
 
00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:00.760 align:start position:0%
are notifications to the state and
 
00:20:02.549 --> 00:20:02.559 align:start position:0%
there's an ability to recoup any funds
 
00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
owed to the state or um with regard to
 
00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:08.760 align:start position:0%
the um those fees so there's like sort
 
00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
of an um requirement for fiscal
 
00:20:14.110 --> 00:20:14.120 align:start position:0%
oversight and management and assurity
 
00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
that those things are being met other
 
00:20:19.789 --> 00:20:19.799 align:start position:0%
than that I think that we have addressed
 
00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:21.880 align:start position:0%
by and large the things that we had
 
00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
talked about the other um
 
00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:34.840 align:start position:0%
to when we looked at I I just want to
 
00:20:36.909 --> 00:20:36.919 align:start position:0%
continue on so
 
00:20:39.789 --> 00:20:39.799 align:start position:0%
one Beyond page six we're looking at one
 
00:20:39.799 --> 00:20:42.430 align:start position:0%
one Beyond page six we're looking at one
two

00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:42.440 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:20:48.789 --> 00:20:48.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
subsection six it's um subsection H an
 
00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
evaluation of the effectiveness of paint
 
00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:55.190 align:start position:0%
evaluation of the effectiveness of paint
stewardship

00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:55.200 align:start position:0%
stewardship
 
00:20:58.630 --> 00:20:58.640 align:start position:0%
programs okay so in this conversation is
 
00:21:00.789 --> 00:21:00.799 align:start position:0%
regarding Trade Secrets and proprietary
 
00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:02.720 align:start position:0%
information by a
 
00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:05.320 align:start position:0%
manufacturer um that information is
 
00:21:07.710 --> 00:21:07.720 align:start position:0%
there to make sure that uh their
 
00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:10.360 align:start position:0%
interests are also protected I mean
 
00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:12.400 align:start position:0%
because the paint is reclassified so
 
00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:15.200 align:start position:0%
there's antitrust carve outs and things
 
00:21:17.549 --> 00:21:17.559 align:start position:0%
like that however there have been new
 
00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
EPA regulations with regard to um
 
00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
certain classes of chemicals not being
 
00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
considered proprietary information and
 
00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:29.000 align:start position:0%
so long as that regulation um comp with
 
00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:32.960 align:start position:0%
EPA regulations I think that that um
 
00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:36.760 align:start position:0%
that should stand the way it should be
 
00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:39.480 align:start position:0%
and with that that that's
 
00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:41.960 align:start position:0%
it hey does anybody have any questions
 
00:21:44.669 --> 00:21:44.679 align:start position:0%
representative kalk thank you madam
 
00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
chair um just a couple questions uh let
 
00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:51.400 align:start position:0%
me just get to the page on when we're
 
00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:53.240 align:start position:0%
talking about any producer
 
00:21:55.269 --> 00:21:55.279 align:start position:0%
representative that wishes to become a
 
00:21:57.029 --> 00:21:57.039 align:start position:0%
the stewardship organization shall by
 
00:21:59.470 --> 00:21:59.480 align:start position:0%
January 1 submit a plan
 
00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
um what happens if someone decides after
 
00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:03.480 align:start position:0%
that date that they want to be part of
 
00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:06.360 align:start position:0%
the program um is there anything in here
 
00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
that um talks about
 
00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
that thank you so this would open up a
 
00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
uh an opportunity for applications for
 
00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
the the plan and then the department
 
00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:19.080 align:start position:0%
will then review certain plans so there
 
00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:20.840 align:start position:0%
will be an opportunity establishing
 
00:22:24.430 --> 00:22:24.440 align:start position:0%
rules for them to set a window for when
 
00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:26.120 align:start position:0%
they receive those and when the last
 
00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:29.000 align:start position:0%
date is for the for that uh the plans to
 
00:22:32.789 --> 00:22:32.799 align:start position:0%
be received by um and that is in January
 
00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:34.400 align:start position:0%
and then the goal would be to give
 
00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
entities a full calendar year to get up
 
00:22:40.789 --> 00:22:40.799 align:start position:0%
to speed before the program would launch
 
00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:44.120 align:start position:0%
so follow thank you madam chair um
 
00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:46.640 align:start position:0%
another question is is we have in couple
 
00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:48.440 align:start position:0%
sections about non-refundable
 
00:22:52.789 --> 00:22:52.799 align:start position:0%
application fees but there is no limit
 
00:22:55.269 --> 00:22:55.279 align:start position:0%
on what we're going to charart I mean I
 
00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:56.440 align:start position:0%
understand it's going to be done on
 
00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
rules but if we make it
 
00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
honorous then people won't sign up for
 
00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:04.240 align:start position:0%
it so I just want to be cautious of that
 
00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:07.909 align:start position:0%
it so I just want to be cautious of that
also

00:23:07.909 --> 00:23:07.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:11.640 align:start position:0%
um and may I sure follow thank thank you
 
00:23:14.029 --> 00:23:14.039 align:start position:0%
madam chair um the other thing is is uh
 
00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:15.200 align:start position:0%
where we talk about the original
 
00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:17.360 align:start position:0%
assessment shall not be more than 350
 
00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:19.400 align:start position:0%
for cans above 1 gallon and no less than
 
00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
75 cents for quantity less than or equal
 
00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
to one pint do we have a not not more
 
00:23:27.789 --> 00:23:27.799 align:start position:0%
than for those smaller quantities or
 
00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:29.480 align:start position:0%
we're just setting that saying it can't
 
00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:32.600 align:start position:0%
be less than 75 cents that's correct I
 
00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
feel like at at that point we're getting
 
00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:39.240 align:start position:0%
into 75 cents is not that much of a you
 
00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:41.080 align:start position:0%
know whether it's half a pint or a pint
 
00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:43.720 align:start position:0%
I think that that's probably sufficient
 
00:23:46.510 --> 00:23:46.520 align:start position:0%
and if it needs adjusted as the statute
 
00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
notes um they can do that adjustment and
 
00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
there is also a provision that they can
 
00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
go through Jael car to request
 
00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:57.430 align:start position:0%
go through Jael car to request
adjustments

00:23:57.430 --> 00:23:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:59.350 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:23:59.350 --> 00:23:59.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
um representative kraton has a
 
00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
question uh thank you madam chair
 
00:24:06.789 --> 00:24:06.799 align:start position:0%
actually just a comment U as someone who
 
00:24:09.269 --> 00:24:09.279 align:start position:0%
uses a ton of different paints and stuff
 
00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
like that I think this is a welcome bill
 
00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:17.240 align:start position:0%
and if you look at the the fee of
 
00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
basically a buck a gallon or whatever
 
00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:21.640 align:start position:0%
whatever they come up with in my man
 
00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:24.760 align:start position:0%
that's a a fee that's on me I buy the
 
00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:26.720 align:start position:0%
paint I use the paint I should dispose
 
00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:31.000 align:start position:0%
of the paint uh today there's no easy
 
00:24:34.149 --> 00:24:34.159 align:start position:0%
way to do it and from what we heard in
 
00:24:37.230 --> 00:24:37.240 align:start position:0%
testimony and and what I've read this
 
00:24:39.149 --> 00:24:39.159 align:start position:0%
this makes that possible in an
 
00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
environmentally sound way and so I I
 
00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
commend um representative Murray on her
 
00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
work uh with the amendment that I think
 
00:24:50.669 --> 00:24:50.679 align:start position:0%
answers a lot of the questions from last
 
00:24:53.669 --> 00:24:53.679 align:start position:0%
week thank you represent Bixby so I
 
00:24:56.149 --> 00:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
think that um representative Murray has
 
00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
done an amazing job on this and uh the
 
00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:05.880 align:start position:0%
uh and we uh it it is still coming is
 
00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:08.200 align:start position:0%
still being you know getting through the
 
00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:11.200 align:start position:0%
end of the process at um at ol I hope
 
00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
it's might be upstairs and printed at
 
00:25:16.269 --> 00:25:16.279 align:start position:0%
this point but uh it is conceivable that
 
00:25:19.990 --> 00:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
OMS might have made a couple of uh
 
00:25:22.510 --> 00:25:22.520 align:start position:0%
typographical errors in the process of
 
00:25:24.750 --> 00:25:24.760 align:start position:0%
of of doing this and we're going to be
 
00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:26.840 align:start position:0%
doing a proof reading this week to make
 
00:25:29.149 --> 00:25:29.159 align:start position:0%
sure that that any type of graphical
 
00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
errors get noted uh if they are of no
 
00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:34.600 align:start position:0%
significant importance in terms of the
 
00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
content then that's the sort of thing
 
00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
that can be ironed out in the Senate uh
 
00:25:43.269 --> 00:25:43.279 align:start position:0%
or even in uh the enrolled bills process
 
00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:47.120 align:start position:0%
um but um so we we will be doing a proof
 
00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:48.440 align:start position:0%
reading of the bill before it actually
 
00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
comes to the floor uh and um to make
 
00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:54.320 align:start position:0%
sure that there there are no clerical
 
00:25:57.990 --> 00:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
errors that need to be addressed uh but
 
00:26:00.149 --> 00:26:00.159 align:start position:0%
uh I think that what we have before us
 
00:26:04.029 --> 00:26:04.039 align:start position:0%
here really is the core of uh the
 
00:26:07.149 --> 00:26:07.159 align:start position:0%
content and I think that um I think that
 
00:26:08.669 --> 00:26:08.679 align:start position:0%
uh representative Murray has done a
 
00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:10.840 align:start position:0%
really good job of putting this together
 
00:26:12.269 --> 00:26:12.279 align:start position:0%
uh and I think that's something we need
 
00:26:15.149 --> 00:26:15.159 align:start position:0%
to go forward with representative kto
 
00:26:17.789 --> 00:26:17.799 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and I also will
 
00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:21.480 align:start position:0%
Echo uh represent Bigby's praise for
 
00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:22.960 align:start position:0%
representing Mar really taking the lead
 
00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
on this I think this is an important
 
00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:27.240 align:start position:0%
program um I do have one last question
 
00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:30.120 align:start position:0%
though on regarding retailers and I want
 
00:26:32.669 --> 00:26:32.679 align:start position:0%
to make sure I understand this if a
 
00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
retailer buys paint before the start of
 
00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
this program they're not going to have
 
00:26:38.830 --> 00:26:38.840 align:start position:0%
to worry about the fees on that existing
 
00:26:41.389 --> 00:26:41.399 align:start position:0%
paint order is that correct because it's
 
00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
going to be on the
 
00:26:45.269 --> 00:26:45.279 align:start position:0%
manufacturer so um they won't be
 
00:26:46.870 --> 00:26:46.880 align:start position:0%
prohibited from selling that paint in
 
00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:50.120 align:start position:0%
the state is that correct correct so
 
00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
when it goes into effect that's when
 
00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
those fees will start um and that's why
 
00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
we're giving this a year to like ramp up
 
00:26:58.750 --> 00:26:58.760 align:start position:0%
so that folks have time to adjust
 
00:27:01.269 --> 00:27:01.279 align:start position:0%
apply signage in their um in their
 
00:27:03.789 --> 00:27:03.799 align:start position:0%
establishments and have clear direction
 
00:27:07.149 --> 00:27:07.159 align:start position:0%
from an entity on on what it is that
 
00:27:10.149 --> 00:27:10.159 align:start position:0%
they're actually um going to let folks
 
00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
know again like I said there's no fee
 
00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
collections um at the register and there
 
00:27:17.669 --> 00:27:17.679 align:start position:0%
are no fees uh being collected at the
 
00:27:20.669 --> 00:27:20.679 align:start position:0%
depositing site so and I think we had
 
00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:23.640 align:start position:0%
some conversation around Legacy paint um
 
00:27:26.389 --> 00:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
my feeling is that Legacy paint will um
 
00:27:28.230 --> 00:27:28.240 align:start position:0%
ultimately probably arrive at those
 
00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
locations but it will quickly phase
 
00:27:32.909 --> 00:27:32.919 align:start position:0%
itself out as a you know Aunt Sally's
 
00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:35.200 align:start position:0%
under cabinet is being cleaned out and
 
00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
being brought into in and I think that
 
00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:42.480 align:start position:0%
that is um the desire is to see um that
 
00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:44.840 align:start position:0%
any future paint sales has something
 
00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:46.480 align:start position:0%
like this to keep it out of landfilling
 
00:27:49.509 --> 00:27:49.519 align:start position:0%
and also then to keep um these items
 
00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:51.960 align:start position:0%
from being poured into you know whether
 
00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
it's kitty litter or any any other type
 
00:27:56.310 --> 00:27:56.320 align:start position:0%
of thing um and keeping our environment
 
00:27:59.630 --> 00:27:59.640 align:start position:0%
as clean as possible

subcommittee as well um this is a really
 
00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:21.640 align:start position:0%
a really good piece of legislation as
 
00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:25.200 align:start position:0%
far as I can see and in so far as if you
 
00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
know typographically if there's
 
00:28:29.909 --> 00:28:29.919 align:start position:0%
something missing or whatever I mean I
 
00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:31.360 align:start position:0%
plan to
 
00:28:34.269 --> 00:28:34.279 align:start position:0%
um once we get the uh
 
00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:37.720 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh for the exec session I plan
 
00:28:40.590 --> 00:28:40.600 align:start position:0%
to vote for the amendment and you know
 
00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
we just so the committee knows we did
 
00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:44.720 align:start position:0%
have a bill that passed out of our
 
00:28:47.470 --> 00:28:47.480 align:start position:0%
committee that didn't have that OS had
 
00:28:50.389 --> 00:28:50.399 align:start position:0%
omitted the effective date from uh one
 
00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:52.960 align:start position:0%
of our bills and I had to have it fixed
 
00:28:54.669 --> 00:28:54.679 align:start position:0%
in ways and means when it when it went
 
00:28:56.950 --> 00:28:56.960 align:start position:0%
to the second committee so I mean it's
 
00:28:59.590 --> 00:28:59.600 align:start position:0%
not like we haven't had that happen to
 
00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
us with a typographical error or an
 
00:29:06.549 --> 00:29:06.559 align:start position:0%
Omission but um overall this bill is uh
 
00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:08.760 align:start position:0%

exec session our first bill that we are
 
00:33:27.909 --> 00:33:27.919 align:start position:0%
going to uh consider for executive
 
00:33:30.509 --> 00:33:30.519 align:start position:0%
session is HB
 
00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:33.440 align:start position:0%
1574 removing regulations on the direct
 
00:33:36.430 --> 00:33:36.440 align:start position:0%
sale of raw milk to
 
00:33:40.110 --> 00:33:40.120 align:start position:0%
Consumers um do I hear a motion for that
 
00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:43.360 align:start position:0%
bill representative Duty uh yes thank
 
00:33:45.789 --> 00:33:45.799 align:start position:0%
you Madame chair uh I would like to move
 
00:33:49.509 --> 00:33:49.519 align:start position:0%
itl on hb1 1574
 
00:33:52.590 --> 00:33:52.600 align:start position:0%
dfn do I hear a second representative
 
00:33:56.110 --> 00:33:56.120 align:start position:0%
Kenny um I'll second that thank you
 
00:33:57.830 --> 00:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
representative Duty would you like to
 
00:34:00.629 --> 00:34:00.639 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion please uh yes I
 
00:34:02.509 --> 00:34:02.519 align:start position:0%
believe it was in the last year or two
 
00:34:04.990 --> 00:34:05.000 align:start position:0%
that we heard a bill very similar to
 
00:34:08.109 --> 00:34:08.119 align:start position:0%
this uh and I think at that time uh we
 
00:34:11.470 --> 00:34:11.480 align:start position:0%
did increase um the amount of raw mil
 
00:34:14.470 --> 00:34:14.480 align:start position:0%
that could be sold to Consumers so I
 
00:34:17.430 --> 00:34:17.440 align:start position:0%
think um because enough time has not
 
00:34:20.750 --> 00:34:20.760 align:start position:0%
passed for us to see how that bill uh
 
00:34:23.430 --> 00:34:23.440 align:start position:0%
plays out in um in the retail the
 
00:34:25.909 --> 00:34:25.919 align:start position:0%
consumer Market uh I believe we should
 
00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
itl this bill
 
00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
any other further discussion
 
00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:30.829 align:start position:0%
any other further discussion
representative

00:34:30.829 --> 00:34:30.839 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:34:35.389 --> 00:34:35.399 align:start position:0%
Bixby so over the last uh decade or so
 
00:34:36.990 --> 00:34:37.000 align:start position:0%
we've had a number of bills dealing with
 
00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
raw milk um and uh there are currently
 
00:34:45.389 --> 00:34:45.399 align:start position:0%
two ways that raw milk is dealt with
 
00:34:47.669 --> 00:34:47.679 align:start position:0%
with in the state one is through Farms
 
00:34:49.510 --> 00:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
that are inspected and certified by the
 
00:34:51.430 --> 00:34:51.440 align:start position:0%
state and that can be a larger amount
 
00:34:55.909 --> 00:34:55.919 align:start position:0%
than 20 gallons or or uh and uh there
 
00:34:58.710 --> 00:34:58.720 align:start position:0%
and then there are operations that are
 
00:35:01.870 --> 00:35:01.880 align:start position:0%
very small and uh can produce up to 20
 
00:35:05.349 --> 00:35:05.359 align:start position:0%
gallons and can produce ice cream in
 
00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:08.720 align:start position:0%
quantities no larger than uh a uh 6
 
00:35:11.790 --> 00:35:11.800 align:start position:0%
ounce serving the reasons for those are
 
00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
were worked out um by a former member of
 
00:35:16.510 --> 00:35:16.520 align:start position:0%
this committee who was in the dairy
 
00:35:21.390 --> 00:35:21.400 align:start position:0%
industry for uh many decades and uh I
 
00:35:23.910 --> 00:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
think that his expertise on helping
 
00:35:27.829 --> 00:35:27.839 align:start position:0%
craft the what we currently have uh has
 
00:35:30.190 --> 00:35:30.200 align:start position:0%
been a has been really good and I think
 
00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
that we don't need to change what we
 
00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:32.990 align:start position:0%
that we don't need to change what we
have

00:35:32.990 --> 00:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:35:36.510 --> 00:35:36.520 align:start position:0%
now represent kraton yeah thank you
 
00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
madam chair I I agree with the the I
 
00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
motion the thing that really struck out
 
00:35:47.550 --> 00:35:47.560 align:start position:0%
to me and testimony was 150 times risk
 
00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:49.960 align:start position:0%
to health issues associated with this
 
00:35:53.829 --> 00:35:53.839 align:start position:0%
bill as as per uh DHHS that really
 
00:35:56.430 --> 00:35:56.440 align:start position:0%
struck home so I I agree with the itl
 
00:35:59.150 --> 00:35:59.160 align:start position:0%
motion thank you
 
00:36:01.829 --> 00:36:01.839 align:start position:0%
okay representative ktoa thank you madam
 
00:36:01.839 --> 00:36:03.589 align:start position:0%
okay representative ktoa thank you madam
chair

00:36:03.589 --> 00:36:03.599 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:06.160 align:start position:0%
um this bill just
 
00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
eliminated any amount uh restrictions
 
00:36:15.470 --> 00:36:15.480 align:start position:0%
and um we need to be very cautious
 
00:36:19.470 --> 00:36:19.480 align:start position:0%
because um we have some really great raw
 
00:36:21.589 --> 00:36:21.599 align:start position:0%
milk legislation in this state actually
 
00:36:23.230 --> 00:36:23.240 align:start position:0%
I believe we were one of the leaders at
 
00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
a time when uh people were fearful of
 
00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:28.480 align:start position:0%
raw milk
 
00:36:32.030 --> 00:36:32.040 align:start position:0%
and um we the farmers can take that 20
 
00:36:33.589 --> 00:36:33.599 align:start position:0%
gallons and can
 
00:36:38.109 --> 00:36:38.119 align:start position:0%
produce uh hard cheese butter kefir all
 
00:36:41.550 --> 00:36:41.560 align:start position:0%
types of products with that on a daily
 
00:36:45.390 --> 00:36:45.400 align:start position:0%
basis so I think um and we need to be
 
00:36:48.069 --> 00:36:48.079 align:start position:0%
cognizant that we want to make sure that
 
00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:51.680 align:start position:0%
we keep our freedoms um I would not have
 
00:36:53.710 --> 00:36:53.720 align:start position:0%
been imposed to a small incremental
 
00:36:58.349 --> 00:36:58.359 align:start position:0%
increase but to have no restrictions uh
 
00:37:00.270 --> 00:37:00.280 align:start position:0%
would not be in the best interest of
 
00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:03.950 align:start position:0%
would not be in the best interest of
Public

00:37:03.950 --> 00:37:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:06.870 --> 00:37:06.880 align:start position:0%
Health I yeah representative Penza and
 
00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:08.870 align:start position:0%
Health I yeah representative Penza and
then

00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:37:12.349 --> 00:37:12.359 align:start position:0%
ger yeah I being new I just think it it
 
00:37:14.390 --> 00:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
makes the most sense
 
00:37:18.349 --> 00:37:18.359 align:start position:0%
um how things have been progressed and
 
00:37:20.670 --> 00:37:20.680 align:start position:0%
that we let this settle for the
 
00:37:22.430 --> 00:37:22.440 align:start position:0%
legislation that just passed either last
 
00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
year or the year before um and have
 
00:37:28.030 --> 00:37:28.040 align:start position:0%
incremental changes as you know
 
00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
let this settle um before just kind of
 
00:37:33.790 --> 00:37:33.800 align:start position:0%
wiping out all restrictions so um I yeah
 
00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
I think this is premature representative
 
00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
gerana thank you madam chair uh I think
 
00:37:40.670 --> 00:37:40.680 align:start position:0%
that representative ktoa made an
 
00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:42.640 align:start position:0%
excellent point I think that that the
 
00:37:44.470 --> 00:37:44.480 align:start position:0%
legislation that has been enacted has
 
00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
been very good it's been very good for
 
00:37:47.630 --> 00:37:47.640 align:start position:0%
the state and for our farmers and
 
00:37:49.750 --> 00:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
there's a chance of you know legislation
 
00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:51.720 align:start position:0%
kind of going too far and reversing some
 
00:37:55.109 --> 00:37:55.119 align:start position:0%
of that if we have some issues so uh I
 
00:37:57.069 --> 00:37:57.079 align:start position:0%
also think that an incremental approach
 
00:37:59.069 --> 00:37:59.079 align:start position:0%
is a but as you said I wanted to Second
 
00:38:00.829 --> 00:38:00.839 align:start position:0%
representative comtois point that what
 
00:38:03.190 --> 00:38:03.200 align:start position:0%
we have done has worked really really
 
00:38:04.630 --> 00:38:04.640 align:start position:0%
well and it's important that we don't
 
00:38:07.150 --> 00:38:07.160 align:start position:0%
take any steps backwards so thank you
 
00:38:09.710 --> 00:38:09.720 align:start position:0%
thank you and I Echo those sentiments as
 
00:38:12.349 --> 00:38:12.359 align:start position:0%
well I think you know what we we have
 
00:38:15.870 --> 00:38:15.880 align:start position:0%
the most liberal um raw milk uh
 
00:38:18.430 --> 00:38:18.440 align:start position:0%
production I think in the nation is what
 
00:38:22.710 --> 00:38:22.720 align:start position:0%
I had heard and um I I do think that uh
 
00:38:24.550 --> 00:38:24.560 align:start position:0%
some of the the restrictions that we
 
00:38:27.150 --> 00:38:27.160 align:start position:0%
have put in place in the past um really
 
00:38:29.990 --> 00:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
have to do with risk management and I
 
00:38:31.950 --> 00:38:31.960 align:start position:0%
think we've done it pretty well and
 
00:38:35.550 --> 00:38:35.560 align:start position:0%
seeing how um how the how it works um
 
00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:37.640 align:start position:0%
and we haven't really seen any of the
 
00:38:40.750 --> 00:38:40.760 align:start position:0%
farmers uh protesting that they want
 
00:38:43.069 --> 00:38:43.079 align:start position:0%
bigger you know less restriction or
 
00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:46.720 align:start position:0%
whatever um they seem to have um settled
 
00:38:49.470 --> 00:38:49.480 align:start position:0%
in on this pretty well and and are are
 
00:38:53.349 --> 00:38:53.359 align:start position:0%
selling their raw milk products um and
 
00:38:56.349 --> 00:38:56.359 align:start position:0%
so I I'm absolutely uh for it Ling this
 
00:38:58.870 --> 00:38:58.880 align:start position:0%
bill because I don't see any need really
 
00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
to lift entirely lift the restrictions
 
00:39:04.109 --> 00:39:04.119 align:start position:0%
that we've put in place in the
 
00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:06.680 align:start position:0%
past so if there's any no other
 
00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:09.200 align:start position:0%
discussion on this bill I would uh ask
 
00:39:11.430 --> 00:39:11.440 align:start position:0%

of drones for the aerial application of
 
00:40:40.589 --> 00:40:40.599 align:start position:0%
pesticides and I would like to move um
 
00:40:43.309 --> 00:40:43.319 align:start position:0%

and I will second I see representative
 
00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
Bixby seconding that thank you very much
 
00:41:05.470 --> 00:41:05.480 align:start position:0%
and I'll speak to my Amendment which we
 
00:41:08.750 --> 00:41:08.760 align:start position:0%
had discussed earlier um the amendment
 
00:41:13.309 --> 00:41:13.319 align:start position:0%
to this bill uh points to uh RSA 422
 
00:41:13.319 --> 00:41:14.390 align:start position:0%
to this bill uh points to uh RSA 422
colon

00:41:14.390 --> 00:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
colon
 
00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
3 uh Roman numeral Roman numeral 30
 
00:41:22.589 --> 00:41:22.599 align:start position:0%
which um defines what unmanned aircraft
 
00:41:25.470 --> 00:41:25.480 align:start position:0%
means uh which points to the federal
 
00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
definition of unmanned aircraft
 
00:41:30.750 --> 00:41:30.760 align:start position:0%
uh and that uh the amendment also
 
00:41:33.790 --> 00:41:33.800 align:start position:0%
changes the height at which um spraying
 
00:41:37.109 --> 00:41:37.119 align:start position:0%
can occur uh it may not exceed 20 feet
 
00:41:40.109 --> 00:41:40.119 align:start position:0%
above ground level any discussion on
 
00:41:43.390 --> 00:41:43.400 align:start position:0%
this amendment representative
 
00:41:47.710 --> 00:41:47.720 align:start position:0%
kraton uh yes ma'am um this amendment
 
00:41:51.430 --> 00:41:51.440 align:start position:0%
answered the questions that I had uh one
 
00:41:56.109 --> 00:41:56.119 align:start position:0%
the height in fact reduces the amount of
 
00:41:59.069 --> 00:41:59.079 align:start position:0%
uh wind impact and spray over um
 
00:42:01.990 --> 00:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
especially because the Drone pushes the
 
00:42:06.030 --> 00:42:06.040 align:start position:0%
pesticide down whereas if you're going
 
00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:08.640 align:start position:0%
from the from the ground is going up and
 
00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:10.240 align:start position:0%
getting more into the atmosphere and
 
00:42:12.390 --> 00:42:12.400 align:start position:0%
there's more spread and then the other
 
00:42:15.950 --> 00:42:15.960 align:start position:0%
thing to discussion we had with rep
 
00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:19.280 align:start position:0%
Penza that I think is important is the
 
00:42:23.990 --> 00:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
application of this drone um pesticide
 
00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
is by professionally licensed folks and
 
00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:30.480 align:start position:0%
so most of these um Farms that are using
 
00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:32.240 align:start position:0%
this technique are
 
00:42:35.270 --> 00:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
Contracting licensed professionals if
 
00:42:36.870 --> 00:42:36.880 align:start position:0%
they're doing it by themselves and they
 
00:42:40.309 --> 00:42:40.319 align:start position:0%
are in fact licensed professionals so I
 
00:42:43.349 --> 00:42:43.359 align:start position:0%
I think uh again great work working with
 
00:42:45.390 --> 00:42:45.400 align:start position:0%
folks to overcome some of the issues
 
00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
that we found last week and I will be
 
00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
voting OTP on this amendment represent
 
00:42:54.349 --> 00:42:54.359 align:start position:0%
Bixby yeah so the amendment addresses uh
 
00:42:57.190 --> 00:42:57.200 align:start position:0%
a couple of things one is the uh the
 
00:42:58.950 --> 00:42:58.960 align:start position:0%
spray height which in the original bill
 
00:43:01.589 --> 00:43:01.599 align:start position:0%
was 5050 feet this drops it to 20 feet
 
00:43:04.990 --> 00:43:05.000 align:start position:0%
that uh is a a great Improvement uh the
 
00:43:08.589 --> 00:43:08.599 align:start position:0%
other is that it cites uh the
 
00:43:13.349 --> 00:43:13.359 align:start position:0%
appropriate other statutes uh that are
 
00:43:17.109 --> 00:43:17.119 align:start position:0%
that govern uh aerial spraying uh and it
 
00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
allows for drones that are greater than
 
00:43:23.630 --> 00:43:23.640 align:start position:0%
55 pounds uh and those drones have not
 
00:43:26.150 --> 00:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
only uh so there there are pesticide
 
00:43:28.069 --> 00:43:28.079 align:start position:0%
regulations at the state level and then
 
00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
there are uh pilot regulations at the
 
00:43:32.470 --> 00:43:32.480 align:start position:0%
federal level
 
00:43:38.109 --> 00:43:38.119 align:start position:0%
so uh the um the so the one needs to be
 
00:43:39.870 --> 00:43:39.880 align:start position:0%
licensed not only as a pesticide
 
00:43:43.950 --> 00:43:43.960 align:start position:0%
applicator but also as a drone drone
 
00:43:45.910 --> 00:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
pilot in order to be able to do this
 
00:43:49.349 --> 00:43:49.359 align:start position:0%
work uh that's typically going to be as
 
00:43:51.069 --> 00:43:51.079 align:start position:0%
representative Katon said a contractor
 
00:43:53.349 --> 00:43:53.359 align:start position:0%
although a farmer could in fact you get
 
00:43:56.270 --> 00:43:56.280 align:start position:0%
all those licensing if if he or she
 
00:43:57.750 --> 00:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
chose to
 
00:43:59.430 --> 00:43:59.440 align:start position:0%
so I think this is a really great bill
 
00:44:01.589 --> 00:44:01.599 align:start position:0%
and we should just pass
 
00:44:01.599 --> 00:44:04.190 align:start position:0%
and we should just pass
it

00:44:04.190 --> 00:44:04.200 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:44:07.630 --> 00:44:07.640 align:start position:0%
okay all right and any other
 
00:44:10.549 --> 00:44:10.559 align:start position:0%
discussion um representive kto thank you
 
00:44:13.390 --> 00:44:13.400 align:start position:0%
madam chair um and I'd like to thank you
 
00:44:16.190 --> 00:44:16.200 align:start position:0%
uh for working on this uh this will be a
 
00:44:18.109 --> 00:44:18.119 align:start position:0%
huge win for agriculture in New
 
00:44:21.750 --> 00:44:21.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire not only will it help um with
 
00:44:25.309 --> 00:44:25.319 align:start position:0%
really targeting where the pesticides go
 
00:44:28.109 --> 00:44:28.119 align:start position:0%
uh but will also help um um with
 
00:44:30.190 --> 00:44:30.200 align:start position:0%
overspray and I think we'll see a
 
00:44:32.349 --> 00:44:32.359 align:start position:0%
reduction in pesticides through use of
 
00:44:34.790 --> 00:44:34.800 align:start position:0%
drones and it will also help reduce the
 
00:44:37.829 --> 00:44:37.839 align:start position:0%
capital outlay that Farms have to uh
 
00:44:40.510 --> 00:44:40.520 align:start position:0%
make if they utilize these drone
 
00:44:42.790 --> 00:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
operators thank
 
00:44:45.950 --> 00:44:45.960 align:start position:0%
you seeing no other uh discussion for
 
00:44:49.309 --> 00:44:49.319 align:start position:0%
this bill um this amendment I would ask

1703 relative to the sale of kangaroo
 
00:46:52.670 --> 00:46:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:56.430 --> 00:46:56.440 align:start position:0%
motion yes' representative Katon I rep
 
00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:00.160 align:start position:0%
uh I recommend itl do I hear a second
 
00:47:03.430 --> 00:47:03.440 align:start position:0%
representative NAB I second the motion
 
00:47:05.109 --> 00:47:05.119 align:start position:0%
thank you representative kraton would
 
00:47:07.990 --> 00:47:08.000 align:start position:0%
you like to speak to your motion yeah
 
00:47:10.430 --> 00:47:10.440 align:start position:0%
yes Madam chair the the
 
00:47:13.270 --> 00:47:13.280 align:start position:0%
overwhelming argument uh that pushed me
 
00:47:16.870 --> 00:47:16.880 align:start position:0%
to itl was the fear and the threat to
 
00:47:19.510 --> 00:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
carbon wasting disease in in the state
 
00:47:22.109 --> 00:47:22.119 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire uh we heard testimony
 
00:47:24.430 --> 00:47:24.440 align:start position:0%
that that was not a problem right now
 
00:47:26.109 --> 00:47:26.119 align:start position:0%
but that could be a significant problem
 
00:47:30.750 --> 00:47:30.760 align:start position:0%
bringing Carib in uh even if you Fen the
 
00:47:33.630 --> 00:47:33.640 align:start position:0%
Caribou uh appropriately that doesn't
 
00:47:35.630 --> 00:47:35.640 align:start position:0%
mean they couldn't get out or that the
 
00:47:37.230 --> 00:47:37.240 align:start position:0%
disease could not be brought into the
 
00:47:39.829 --> 00:47:39.839 align:start position:0%
state and I think that the risk of
 
00:47:42.270 --> 00:47:42.280 align:start position:0%
chronic wasting disease to the state
 
00:47:46.750 --> 00:47:46.760 align:start position:0%
overwhelms the desire to uh commercially
 
00:47:49.030 --> 00:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
grow kangaroo or Caribou meat in the
 
00:47:53.710 --> 00:47:53.720 align:start position:0%
state over okay any other comment on
 
00:47:55.950 --> 00:47:55.960 align:start position:0%

1703 and I open up the exec session for
 
00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:03.430 align:start position:0%
1703 and I open up the exec session for
HB

00:49:03.430 --> 00:49:03.440 align:start position:0%
HB
 
00:49:06.230 --> 00:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
1145 prohibiting the private ownership
 
00:49:08.789 --> 00:49:08.799 align:start position:0%
of landfills and I would like to make
 
00:49:10.109 --> 00:49:10.119 align:start position:0%
the motion of
 
00:49:12.670 --> 00:49:12.680 align:start position:0%
itl do I hear a second representative
 
00:49:16.510 --> 00:49:16.520 align:start position:0%
Katon ma'am I second that motion okay um
 
00:49:18.990 --> 00:49:19.000 align:start position:0%
I will speak to my motion then um I
 
00:49:23.109 --> 00:49:23.119 align:start position:0%
believe that um this bill should be ited
 
00:49:23.119 --> 00:49:24.309 align:start position:0%
believe that um this bill should be ited
simply

00:49:24.309 --> 00:49:24.319 align:start position:0%
simply
 
00:49:27.150 --> 00:49:27.160 align:start position:0%
because there is nothing prohib hibiting
 
00:49:30.589 --> 00:49:30.599 align:start position:0%
the state right now from opening a
 
00:49:34.829 --> 00:49:34.839 align:start position:0%
landfill and um prohibiting private
 
00:49:38.510 --> 00:49:38.520 align:start position:0%
ownership I I certainly have problems
 
00:49:42.870 --> 00:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
with um prohibiting private ownership of
 
00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:44.630 align:start position:0%
with um prohibiting private ownership of
anything

00:49:44.630 --> 00:49:44.640 align:start position:0%
anything
 
00:49:48.990 --> 00:49:49.000 align:start position:0%
um but this this bill is meant to deal
 
00:49:51.670 --> 00:49:51.680 align:start position:0%
with the issue of out of state trash and
 
00:49:54.430 --> 00:49:54.440 align:start position:0%
the amount of out ofate trash that comes
 
00:49:55.470 --> 00:49:55.480 align:start position:0%
into New
 
00:49:58.309 --> 00:49:58.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um
 
00:49:59.789 --> 00:49:59.799 align:start position:0%
well I believe this bill is
 
00:50:03.270 --> 00:50:03.280 align:start position:0%
well-intentioned I just don't see that
 
00:50:07.309 --> 00:50:07.319 align:start position:0%
um this is a necessary thing to do
 
00:50:09.789 --> 00:50:09.799 align:start position:0%
simply because as I stated before the
 
00:50:12.190 --> 00:50:12.200 align:start position:0%
state has full ability right now to open
 
00:50:16.430 --> 00:50:16.440 align:start position:0%
up uh a landfill and um that's all I
 
00:50:18.829 --> 00:50:18.839 align:start position:0%
would have to say and I welcome any
 
00:50:21.990 --> 00:50:22.000 align:start position:0%
other comments representative Bixby so
 
00:50:26.470 --> 00:50:26.480 align:start position:0%
um the the issue the the core issue with
 
00:50:29.750 --> 00:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
it is in fact out ofate trash
 
00:50:33.430 --> 00:50:33.440 align:start position:0%
and the problem with out ofate trash is
 
00:50:36.390 --> 00:50:36.400 align:start position:0%
that uh the state does not have the
 
00:50:40.789 --> 00:50:40.799 align:start position:0%
authority to uh fully regulate out ofate
 
00:50:44.670 --> 00:50:44.680 align:start position:0%
trash uh from or or can't can't regulate
 
00:50:47.349 --> 00:50:47.359 align:start position:0%
out ofate trash any differently than
 
00:50:52.030 --> 00:50:52.040 align:start position:0%
instate trash uh because of the um
 
00:50:54.030 --> 00:50:54.040 align:start position:0%
interstate commerce clause in the
 
00:50:57.109 --> 00:50:57.119 align:start position:0%
Constitution and that means that we
 
00:51:00.309 --> 00:51:00.319 align:start position:0%
can't do things that would prohibit
 
00:51:03.309 --> 00:51:03.319 align:start position:0%
putting out ofate trash into our
 
00:51:06.069 --> 00:51:06.079 align:start position:0%
landfills uh unless we had that those
 
00:51:08.990 --> 00:51:09.000 align:start position:0%
same prohibitions on instate trash uh
 
00:51:11.150 --> 00:51:11.160 align:start position:0%
which this really constrains our ability
 
00:51:14.069 --> 00:51:14.079 align:start position:0%
to control what sort of out ofate trash
 
00:51:18.670 --> 00:51:18.680 align:start position:0%
we is coming in it also um uh the the
 
00:51:20.789 --> 00:51:20.799 align:start position:0%
interstate commerce clause also indicate
 
00:51:23.150 --> 00:51:23.160 align:start position:0%
would say that we can't charge diff
 
00:51:25.630 --> 00:51:25.640 align:start position:0%
differential rates for out ofate out
 
00:51:29.349 --> 00:51:29.359 align:start position:0%
ofate trash and in state trash we can't
 
00:51:32.109 --> 00:51:32.119 align:start position:0%
uh make exclusions on particular types
 
00:51:34.910 --> 00:51:34.920 align:start position:0%
of outer State trash if we put those if
 
00:51:38.510 --> 00:51:38.520 align:start position:0%
if any of that um sort of trash is put
 
00:51:40.510 --> 00:51:40.520 align:start position:0%
into landfills from instate
 
00:51:43.390 --> 00:51:43.400 align:start position:0%
sources uh by making by requiring that
 
00:51:46.910 --> 00:51:46.920 align:start position:0%
new landfills be publicly owned and that
 
00:51:49.549 --> 00:51:49.559 align:start position:0%
could be either at the state level or at
 
00:51:53.710 --> 00:51:53.720 align:start position:0%
a county or Min Municipal level uh that
 
00:51:57.750 --> 00:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
would give us the power to say
 
00:52:01.990 --> 00:52:02.000 align:start position:0%
that uh the uh we could we would be able
 
00:52:04.270 --> 00:52:04.280 align:start position:0%
to charge differential rates for out of
 
00:52:07.270 --> 00:52:07.280 align:start position:0%
state in and inate trash at a publicly
 
00:52:11.150 --> 00:52:11.160 align:start position:0%
owned landfill we would be able to say
 
00:52:13.190 --> 00:52:13.200 align:start position:0%
there are certain things that we will
 
00:52:15.789 --> 00:52:15.799 align:start position:0%
not accept from out of state in a public
 
00:52:19.109 --> 00:52:19.119 align:start position:0%
landfill we would be able to say that uh
 
00:52:22.230 --> 00:52:22.240 align:start position:0%
we can put a cap of you know any amount
 
00:52:26.069 --> 00:52:26.079 align:start position:0%
that we any any a cap of any severity or
 
00:52:28.789 --> 00:52:28.799 align:start position:0%
or strength on on the total amount of
 
00:52:33.030 --> 00:52:33.040 align:start position:0%
out ofate trash coming in so that uh it
 
00:52:35.230 --> 00:52:35.240 align:start position:0%
really gives us a whole lot more control
 
00:52:39.710 --> 00:52:39.720 align:start position:0%
in terms of how this works with um with
 
00:52:42.870 --> 00:52:42.880 align:start position:0%
uh business uh the bill actually says
 
00:52:45.789 --> 00:52:45.799 align:start position:0%
that the that if it's a state-owned
 
00:52:49.549 --> 00:52:49.559 align:start position:0%
landfill it would have to be operated by
 
00:52:52.789 --> 00:52:52.799 align:start position:0%
a uh a private uh um company that would
 
00:52:56.710 --> 00:52:56.720 align:start position:0%
be hired uh through the full RFP process
 
00:53:00.390 --> 00:53:00.400 align:start position:0%
to manage that landfill uh
 
00:53:03.430 --> 00:53:03.440 align:start position:0%
and this is actually some so across the
 
00:53:07.230 --> 00:53:07.240 align:start position:0%
country uh roughly half of the landfills
 
00:53:08.950 --> 00:53:08.960 align:start position:0%
that are operating across the country
 
00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:12.240 align:start position:0%
right now are publicly owned and the
 
00:53:15.589 --> 00:53:15.599 align:start position:0%
ones of those that are uh most
 
00:53:18.829 --> 00:53:18.839 align:start position:0%
successful are the ones that are using a
 
00:53:21.910 --> 00:53:21.920 align:start position:0%
pro public private man uh partnership
 
00:53:24.549 --> 00:53:24.559 align:start position:0%
like uh what this bill would create so I
 
00:53:27.510 --> 00:53:27.520 align:start position:0%
think that um this is really way of
 
00:53:29.990 --> 00:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
helping New Hampshire take control of
 
00:53:31.750 --> 00:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
what trash comes into the state and how
 
00:53:32.950 --> 00:53:32.960 align:start position:0%
it's dealt
 
00:53:36.270 --> 00:53:36.280 align:start position:0%
with representative kto thank you madam
 
00:53:39.910 --> 00:53:39.920 align:start position:0%
chair and although I understand with rep
 
00:53:41.829 --> 00:53:41.839 align:start position:0%
what representative Bixby is trying to
 
00:53:45.870 --> 00:53:45.880 align:start position:0%
say we do not currently prohibit that in
 
00:53:50.150 --> 00:53:50.160 align:start position:0%
statute we also know that we have
 
00:53:52.230 --> 00:53:52.240 align:start position:0%
municipalities that have their own
 
00:53:54.789 --> 00:53:54.799 align:start position:0%
landfills and do prohibit trash from out
 
00:53:56.990 --> 00:53:57.000 align:start position:0%
ofate and can dictate
 
00:54:01.270 --> 00:54:01.280 align:start position:0%
currently um what is taken in um and
 
00:54:02.430 --> 00:54:02.440 align:start position:0%
then we have
 
00:54:05.309 --> 00:54:05.319 align:start position:0%
Cooperative St places that have that
 
00:54:07.549 --> 00:54:07.559 align:start position:0%
also so there is nothing
 
00:54:11.910 --> 00:54:11.920 align:start position:0%
prohibiting the publicly owned landfills
 
00:54:11.920 --> 00:54:13.470 align:start position:0%
prohibiting the publicly owned landfills
now

00:54:13.470 --> 00:54:13.480 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:54:17.390 --> 00:54:17.400 align:start position:0%
so if a county or municipality thinks
 
00:54:19.870 --> 00:54:19.880 align:start position:0%
that this is an important
 
00:54:22.630 --> 00:54:22.640 align:start position:0%
issue they can take this up on their own
 
00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:24.470 align:start position:0%
issue they can take this up on their own
without

00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
without
 
00:54:27.309 --> 00:54:27.319 align:start position:0%
legislation representative ger
 
00:54:28.950 --> 00:54:28.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh representative
 
00:54:30.430 --> 00:54:30.440 align:start position:0%
Bixby hit a lot of the points that I
 
00:54:32.750 --> 00:54:32.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to hit this is the one bill
 
00:54:35.069 --> 00:54:35.079 align:start position:0%
dealing with out estate waste that
 
00:54:37.549 --> 00:54:37.559 align:start position:0%
allows us to do several things I won't
 
00:54:39.069 --> 00:54:39.079 align:start position:0%
go over them again as representative
 
00:54:41.390 --> 00:54:41.400 align:start position:0%
Bixby has already explained it well also
 
00:54:43.190 --> 00:54:43.200 align:start position:0%
the point that this is not Reinventing
 
00:54:44.910 --> 00:54:44.920 align:start position:0%
the wheel more than half of the
 
00:54:46.829 --> 00:54:46.839 align:start position:0%
landfills in the United States today
 
00:54:48.349 --> 00:54:48.359 align:start position:0%
including several in states around us
 
00:54:50.990 --> 00:54:51.000 align:start position:0%
here in New England are uh publicly
 
00:54:53.190 --> 00:54:53.200 align:start position:0%
owned uh and of course some we have here
 
00:54:55.190 --> 00:54:55.200 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire uh there are two points
 
00:54:56.910 --> 00:54:56.920 align:start position:0%
that I I want to emphasize
 
00:54:59.430 --> 00:54:59.440 align:start position:0%
um one in response to the to the point
 
00:55:01.150 --> 00:55:01.160 align:start position:0%
which is well taken the representative
 
00:55:02.950 --> 00:55:02.960 align:start position:0%
comad just made about there's nothing in
 
00:55:05.230 --> 00:55:05.240 align:start position:0%
legislation Madam chair made this point
 
00:55:06.630 --> 00:55:06.640 align:start position:0%
before that would prohibit the state
 
00:55:08.670 --> 00:55:08.680 align:start position:0%
from doing this now the fact of the
 
00:55:10.990 --> 00:55:11.000 align:start position:0%
matter is we will not need more than one
 
00:55:13.670 --> 00:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
landfill in the state especially if we
 
00:55:15.349 --> 00:55:15.359 align:start position:0%
get our act together on some of our
 
00:55:16.990 --> 00:55:17.000 align:start position:0%
reduction goals which I'm skeptical
 
00:55:19.150 --> 00:55:19.160 align:start position:0%
about but even with the track that we're
 
00:55:21.150 --> 00:55:21.160 align:start position:0%
currently on we're not going to need
 
00:55:23.029 --> 00:55:23.039 align:start position:0%
more than one landfill in this state for
 
00:55:25.109 --> 00:55:25.119 align:start position:0%
the next Century for the rest of this
 
00:55:28.309 --> 00:55:28.319 align:start position:0%
Century if if private companies are
 
00:55:30.750 --> 00:55:30.760 align:start position:0%
allowed to continue to open landfills in
 
00:55:33.630 --> 00:55:33.640 align:start position:0%
the state it's not about need it's about
 
00:55:36.029 --> 00:55:36.039 align:start position:0%
profit it's about being able to continue
 
00:55:38.390 --> 00:55:38.400 align:start position:0%
to take unlimited outof State waste if
 
00:55:40.029 --> 00:55:40.039 align:start position:0%
we're looking at one more landfill in
 
00:55:41.309 --> 00:55:41.319 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire to get us
 
00:55:43.470 --> 00:55:43.480 align:start position:0%
through the rest of the 21st century it
 
00:55:45.589 --> 00:55:45.599 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be a private landfill that can
 
00:55:47.230 --> 00:55:47.240 align:start position:0%
take as much out of state waste as it
 
00:55:50.190 --> 00:55:50.200 align:start position:0%
wants to uh as they want to it should be
 
00:55:52.510 --> 00:55:52.520 align:start position:0%
a publicly owned and privately operated
 
00:55:55.069 --> 00:55:55.079 align:start position:0%
if it's if it's state ownership entity
 
00:55:57.710 --> 00:55:57.720 align:start position:0%
that can give us the benefits that
 
00:56:00.430 --> 00:56:00.440 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby referred to before
 
00:56:02.029 --> 00:56:02.039 align:start position:0%
and I want to reiterate a point that I
 
00:56:04.150 --> 00:56:04.160 align:start position:0%
made when we heard the bill in the first
 
00:56:06.430 --> 00:56:06.440 align:start position:0%
place was that we're talking about the
 
00:56:09.829 --> 00:56:09.839 align:start position:0%
public expense here I think it is clear
 
00:56:11.950 --> 00:56:11.960 align:start position:0%
uh if any of us asked our constituents
 
00:56:13.589 --> 00:56:13.599 align:start position:0%
how they feel about being The Dumping
 
00:56:15.270 --> 00:56:15.280 align:start position:0%
Ground of waste from all over New
 
00:56:17.430 --> 00:56:17.440 align:start position:0%
England I think that where they stand on
 
00:56:19.630 --> 00:56:19.640 align:start position:0%
that is pretty clear I think what our
 
00:56:21.230 --> 00:56:21.240 align:start position:0%
duty in terms of representing their
 
00:56:23.589 --> 00:56:23.599 align:start position:0%
wishes is also pretty clear and I think
 
00:56:26.750 --> 00:56:26.760 align:start position:0%
if we asked them uh our con consents
 
00:56:29.270 --> 00:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
across the state if they would be
 
00:56:32.470 --> 00:56:32.480 align:start position:0%
willing to take that hit per person on
 
00:56:35.750 --> 00:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
their taxes in order to buy the land in
 
00:56:37.789 --> 00:56:37.799 align:start position:0%
order to assure that we will not be The
 
00:56:39.710 --> 00:56:39.720 align:start position:0%
Dumping Ground for out ofate waste in
 
00:56:42.390 --> 00:56:42.400 align:start position:0%
perpetuity I'm confident that that our
 
00:56:44.990 --> 00:56:45.000 align:start position:0%
constituents on either side of the aisle
 
00:56:47.230 --> 00:56:47.240 align:start position:0%
uh would absolutely support that in a
 
00:56:49.870 --> 00:56:49.880 align:start position:0%
heartbeat so uh for all of those reasons
 
00:56:52.309 --> 00:56:52.319 align:start position:0%
I think that this is the right direction
 
00:56:55.589 --> 00:56:55.599 align:start position:0%
for us to go uh so I I also want to
 
00:56:57.630 --> 00:56:57.640 align:start position:0%
point out
 
00:57:00.029 --> 00:57:00.039 align:start position:0%
that with the study committee for out of
 
00:57:01.670 --> 00:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
state waste at least when we produced
 
00:57:05.950 --> 00:57:05.960 align:start position:0%
the report we had support from all
 
00:57:08.670 --> 00:57:08.680 align:start position:0%
members of that committee that was three
 
00:57:10.630 --> 00:57:10.640 align:start position:0%
Republicans and one Democrat and we all
 
00:57:13.630 --> 00:57:13.640 align:start position:0%
supported that when we approved the
 
00:57:16.510 --> 00:57:16.520 align:start position:0%
final report uh we also have bipartisan
 
00:57:17.670 --> 00:57:17.680 align:start position:0%
support as you can see on the
 
00:57:20.470 --> 00:57:20.480 align:start position:0%
sponsorship including bipartisan support
 
00:57:22.230 --> 00:57:22.240 align:start position:0%
on this committee I want to thank
 
00:57:24.589 --> 00:57:24.599 align:start position:0%
representative Penza who has worked on
 
00:57:26.230 --> 00:57:26.240 align:start position:0%
uh these issues regarding out ofate
 
00:57:29.029 --> 00:57:29.039 align:start position:0%
trash so uh I think that this is an
 
00:57:32.150 --> 00:57:32.160 align:start position:0%
issue that we can get bipartisan support
 
00:57:33.990 --> 00:57:34.000 align:start position:0%
for uh on the floor and I have
 
00:57:35.870 --> 00:57:35.880 align:start position:0%
absolutely no question that it has broad
 
00:57:38.430 --> 00:57:38.440 align:start position:0%
support across the state thank you
 
00:57:39.870 --> 00:57:39.880 align:start position:0%
representative kraton and then
 
00:57:42.390 --> 00:57:42.400 align:start position:0%
representative Morris thank you madam
 
00:57:45.990 --> 00:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
chair yeah I I'm not as confident as my
 
00:57:48.430 --> 00:57:48.440 align:start position:0%
neighbor here about uh everyone in this
 
00:57:50.750 --> 00:57:50.760 align:start position:0%
state willing to pay the additional cost
 
00:57:54.390 --> 00:57:54.400 align:start position:0%
I I'm not uh the other thing is this
 
00:57:58.230 --> 00:57:58.240 align:start position:0%
bill I think limits options to the state
 
00:58:01.990 --> 00:58:02.000 align:start position:0%
in terms of if there is only one to make
 
00:58:03.990 --> 00:58:04.000 align:start position:0%
it the most effective the most efficient
 
00:58:06.109 --> 00:58:06.119 align:start position:0%
and the safest it can be I think we
 
00:58:07.630 --> 00:58:07.640 align:start position:0%
should look at all options whether it's
 
00:58:10.029 --> 00:58:10.039 align:start position:0%
public or private if we pass this bill
 
00:58:12.150 --> 00:58:12.160 align:start position:0%
then that takes options off the table
 
00:58:14.230 --> 00:58:14.240 align:start position:0%
that could make it more safe more
 
00:58:16.470 --> 00:58:16.480 align:start position:0%
efficient and more effective over thank
 
00:58:20.630 --> 00:58:20.640 align:start position:0%
you representative Morris thank you um I
 
00:58:22.829 --> 00:58:22.839 align:start position:0%
just would like to sort of second um a
 
00:58:24.190 --> 00:58:24.200 align:start position:0%
lot of the comments that were made by
 
00:58:27.510 --> 00:58:27.520 align:start position:0%
representative gerna um and I I
 
00:58:29.789 --> 00:58:29.799 align:start position:0%
understand the hesitation to limit
 
00:58:32.670 --> 00:58:32.680 align:start position:0%
private ownership of businesses and
 
00:58:34.910 --> 00:58:34.920 align:start position:0%
respect that position however I do think
 
00:58:37.190 --> 00:58:37.200 align:start position:0%
that when it comes down to public health
 
00:58:39.390 --> 00:58:39.400 align:start position:0%
and safety we need to make sure that we
 
00:58:41.630 --> 00:58:41.640 align:start position:0%
are being very careful about making sure
 
00:58:43.069 --> 00:58:43.079 align:start position:0%
that that's going to be regulated to the
 
00:58:44.789 --> 00:58:44.799 align:start position:0%
best of our abilities so that we don't
 
00:58:47.789 --> 00:58:47.799 align:start position:0%
continue to see New Hampshire um you
 
00:58:49.589 --> 00:58:49.599 align:start position:0%
know be number one for different types
 
00:58:52.309 --> 00:58:52.319 align:start position:0%
of cancer in New England and you know so
 
00:58:54.430 --> 00:58:54.440 align:start position:0%
many health concerns that that we see on
 
00:58:57.750 --> 00:58:57.760 align:start position:0%
the rise here largely due to um seeing
 
00:58:59.670 --> 00:58:59.680 align:start position:0%
all of this out ofate trash come into
 
00:59:02.750 --> 00:59:02.760 align:start position:0%
our communities and and cause further
 
00:59:04.829 --> 00:59:04.839 align:start position:0%
concerns for our environment and our
 
00:59:06.430 --> 00:59:06.440 align:start position:0%
constituents than you okay
 
00:59:06.440 --> 00:59:08.430 align:start position:0%
constituents than you okay
representative

00:59:08.430 --> 00:59:08.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:59:11.349 --> 00:59:11.359 align:start position:0%
Penza yeah I just wanted to reiterate or
 
00:59:13.710 --> 00:59:13.720 align:start position:0%
ditto um so much of what representative
 
00:59:17.190 --> 00:59:17.200 align:start position:0%
J said I think the clear piece here is
 
00:59:20.069 --> 00:59:20.079 align:start position:0%
that it it's not just it's a public
 
00:59:22.950 --> 00:59:22.960 align:start position:0%
private partnership because it's not
 
00:59:26.549 --> 00:59:26.559 align:start position:0%
just eliminating private
 
00:59:30.230 --> 00:59:30.240 align:start position:0%
and it's need-based I I think that's the
 
00:59:32.430 --> 00:59:32.440 align:start position:0%
most important thing here we do we
 
00:59:35.150 --> 00:59:35.160 align:start position:0%
really want a private company just you
 
00:59:38.630 --> 00:59:38.640 align:start position:0%
know buying up land to put a landfill in
 
00:59:40.630 --> 00:59:40.640 align:start position:0%
if there's no need it it just doesn't
 
00:59:43.829 --> 00:59:43.839 align:start position:0%
seem to make sense this isn't a a person
 
00:59:46.789 --> 00:59:46.799 align:start position:0%
coming in here and Manufacturing widgets
 
00:59:49.549 --> 00:59:49.559 align:start position:0%
we're talking about trash and we're
 
00:59:51.430 --> 00:59:51.440 align:start position:0%
talking about environmental impact we're
 
00:59:53.430 --> 00:59:53.440 align:start position:0%
talking about the health and safety of
 
00:59:55.789 --> 00:59:55.799 align:start position:0%
all our New Hampshire citizens I think
 
00:59:58.470 --> 00:59:58.480 align:start position:0%
this is a good balance um I very much
 
01:00:01.670 --> 01:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
support the bill and uh that's it thank
 
01:00:03.670 --> 01:00:03.680 align:start position:0%
you any other representative sofikitis
 
01:00:05.910 --> 01:00:05.920 align:start position:0%
and the representative H
 
01:00:09.390 --> 01:00:09.400 align:start position:0%
Haskins we have found in these years
 
01:00:11.549 --> 01:00:11.559 align:start position:0%
since um I've been on this committee
 
01:00:16.309 --> 01:00:16.319 align:start position:0%
that um it was a business model to find
 
01:00:17.750 --> 01:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
towns that were
 
01:00:20.829 --> 01:00:20.839 align:start position:0%
unzoned and um to have a private company
 
01:00:26.190 --> 01:00:26.200 align:start position:0%
come in and say that we that this area
 
01:00:30.069 --> 01:00:30.079 align:start position:0%
needs a landfill and that um they would
 
01:00:32.950 --> 01:00:32.960 align:start position:0%
set people in these small towns against
 
01:00:36.270 --> 01:00:36.280 align:start position:0%
each other by business practices and it
 
01:00:40.430 --> 01:00:40.440 align:start position:0%
was very distressing for me to see um
 
01:00:43.069 --> 01:00:43.079 align:start position:0%
when I go around when I would go around
 
01:00:46.270 --> 01:00:46.280 align:start position:0%
I would see and ask about the capacity
 
01:00:48.029 --> 01:00:48.039 align:start position:0%
and and people would say at the
 
01:00:51.270 --> 01:00:51.280 align:start position:0%
landfills oh we have a 40-year capacity
 
01:00:55.670 --> 01:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
or we have a 50 60 that's a lot of years
 
01:00:58.230 --> 01:00:58.240 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:01:01.270 --> 01:01:01.280 align:start position:0%
so people were being told that that we
 
01:01:03.789 --> 01:01:03.799 align:start position:0%
need these landfills and they don't need
 
01:01:06.150 --> 01:01:06.160 align:start position:0%
them and then what they were doing is
 
01:01:09.150 --> 01:01:09.160 align:start position:0%
just bringing trash from out of state so
 
01:01:11.789 --> 01:01:11.799 align:start position:0%
something to increase knowledge I think
 
01:01:15.430 --> 01:01:15.440 align:start position:0%
that getting people to start
 
01:01:19.270 --> 01:01:19.280 align:start position:0%
understanding that um we all make Trash
 
01:01:22.470 --> 01:01:22.480 align:start position:0%
that's for sure but we um we can dispose
 
01:01:26.510 --> 01:01:26.520 align:start position:0%
of it smartly and that we don't need to
 
01:01:29.990 --> 01:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh pollute or uh for lack of a better
 
01:01:33.270 --> 01:01:33.280 align:start position:0%
word rape our environment to um to put
 
01:01:35.910 --> 01:01:35.920 align:start position:0%
these these um
 
01:01:40.069 --> 01:01:40.079 align:start position:0%
huge landfills in our most pristine and
 
01:01:43.950 --> 01:01:43.960 align:start position:0%
lovely places so I um I think this is a
 
01:01:47.309 --> 01:01:47.319 align:start position:0%
wonderful Bill and I'm glad to support
 
01:01:50.390 --> 01:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
it thank you representative H Haskins
 
01:01:53.309 --> 01:01:53.319 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair we heard very
 
01:01:56.230 --> 01:01:56.240 align:start position:0%
compelling testimony about this bill we
 
01:02:00.230 --> 01:02:00.240 align:start position:0%
had 311 people sign in in support we
 
01:02:03.470 --> 01:02:03.480 align:start position:0%
have a trash problem in the state I
 
01:02:06.549 --> 01:02:06.559 align:start position:0%
think a public private partnership is
 
01:02:09.430 --> 01:02:09.440 align:start position:0%
one of the ways we can attack that
 
01:02:12.109 --> 01:02:12.119 align:start position:0%
problem um people have talked about the
 
01:02:16.190 --> 01:02:16.200 align:start position:0%
environmental impacts some 38 years ago
 
01:02:18.870 --> 01:02:18.880 align:start position:0%
it was decided that we needed private
 
01:02:21.670 --> 01:02:21.680 align:start position:0%
landfills and now we have come to the
 
01:02:24.430 --> 01:02:24.440 align:start position:0%
point where we understand we need local
 
01:02:27.670 --> 01:02:27.680 align:start position:0%
control local control is a very popular
 
01:02:30.349 --> 01:02:30.359 align:start position:0%
Topic in the house so I think that will
 
01:02:33.549 --> 01:02:33.559 align:start position:0%
augur in our favor with this bill I
 
01:02:36.029 --> 01:02:36.039 align:start position:0%
think it's timely I think we need it and
 
01:02:38.910 --> 01:02:38.920 align:start position:0%
I hope people will support it thank
 
01:02:41.549 --> 01:02:41.559 align:start position:0%

01:02:47.029 --> 01:02:47.039 align:start position:0%

Minority Report I will write The
 
01:05:33.750 --> 01:05:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:36.349 --> 01:05:36.359 align:start position:0%
you okay I'm going to close out the
 
01:05:37.990 --> 01:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
exact for HB
 
01:05:42.150 --> 01:05:42.160 align:start position:0%
1145 and open up the exact for hb1
 
01:05:46.510 --> 01:05:46.520 align:start position:0%
1632 relative to outof State waste and
 
01:05:48.789 --> 01:05:48.799 align:start position:0%
do I hear a motion representative gerana
 
01:05:52.109 --> 01:05:52.119 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I move OTP on HB
 
01:05:54.750 --> 01:05:54.760 align:start position:0%
1632 and I will second that and
 
01:05:56.309 --> 01:05:56.319 align:start position:0%
representative ger would you like to
 
01:05:58.109 --> 01:05:58.119 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion thank you madam
 
01:06:00.870 --> 01:06:00.880 align:start position:0%
chair yes this is another approach that
 
01:06:02.870 --> 01:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
came out of the study committee on out
 
01:06:05.710 --> 01:06:05.720 align:start position:0%
of state waste uh we heard testimony
 
01:06:08.349 --> 01:06:08.359 align:start position:0%
from the Attorney General's office that
 
01:06:11.029 --> 01:06:11.039 align:start position:0%
uh there are ways regarding that that we
 
01:06:13.269 --> 01:06:13.279 align:start position:0%
can in effect challenge the interstate
 
01:06:16.190 --> 01:06:16.200 align:start position:0%
commerce clause if we can demonstrate uh
 
01:06:18.470 --> 01:06:18.480 align:start position:0%
that there are sufficient needs in this
 
01:06:20.670 --> 01:06:20.680 align:start position:0%
case the argument would be we're talking
 
01:06:23.870 --> 01:06:23.880 align:start position:0%
about an impact on public resources the
 
01:06:25.789 --> 01:06:25.799 align:start position:0%
land the air the water are public
 
01:06:28.910 --> 01:06:28.920 align:start position:0%
resources and uh given the capacity that
 
01:06:32.109 --> 01:06:32.119 align:start position:0%
we have to meet the needs of instate
 
01:06:35.630 --> 01:06:35.640 align:start position:0%
waste um that it is in the public
 
01:06:36.950 --> 01:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
interest of the people of the State of
 
01:06:38.670 --> 01:06:38.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to be able to restrict the
 
01:06:41.269 --> 01:06:41.279 align:start position:0%
amount that uh we get from out of state
 
01:06:43.269 --> 01:06:43.279 align:start position:0%
that will be a challenge to the
 
01:06:45.269 --> 01:06:45.279 align:start position:0%
interstate commerce clause it I suspect
 
01:06:48.349 --> 01:06:48.359 align:start position:0%
will likely be uh the subject of some uh
 
01:06:51.630 --> 01:06:51.640 align:start position:0%
legal consideration but uh as I said the
 
01:06:53.549 --> 01:06:53.559 align:start position:0%
the recommendation for this legislation
 
01:06:55.109 --> 01:06:55.119 align:start position:0%
came out of that discussion with the
 
01:06:57.510 --> 01:06:57.520 align:start position:0%
attorney General's office and uh and I
 
01:07:00.150 --> 01:07:00.160 align:start position:0%
think that this is definitely a worthy
 
01:07:04.190 --> 01:07:04.200 align:start position:0%
um effort on our part to uh limit that
 
01:07:06.710 --> 01:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
out of state waste from coming in so I
 
01:07:08.670 --> 01:07:08.680 align:start position:0%
hope folks will support the motion
 
01:07:11.150 --> 01:07:11.160 align:start position:0%
representative kraton thank you madam
 
01:07:15.190 --> 01:07:15.200 align:start position:0%
chair I I agree completely that it's a
 
01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:16.109 align:start position:0%
chair I I agree completely that it's a
worthy

01:07:16.109 --> 01:07:16.119 align:start position:0%
worthy
 
01:07:21.150 --> 01:07:21.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:24.349 --> 01:07:24.359 align:start position:0%
OTP I do have a concern that that has
 
01:07:26.470 --> 01:07:26.480 align:start position:0%
been I've just discussed at length with
 
01:07:28.950 --> 01:07:28.960 align:start position:0%
several folks and I still have some
 
01:07:30.630 --> 01:07:30.640 align:start position:0%
concern but I'm going to vote OTP my
 
01:07:35.230 --> 01:07:35.240 align:start position:0%
concern is that if you're taking 35% of
 
01:07:38.029 --> 01:07:38.039 align:start position:0%
the tips away from each one of these
 
01:07:39.950 --> 01:07:39.960 align:start position:0%
folks that that's going to have a
 
01:07:42.069 --> 01:07:42.079 align:start position:0%
significant impact on the bottom line
 
01:07:43.109 --> 01:07:43.119 align:start position:0%
for those
 
01:07:47.750 --> 01:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
companies that those tips uh that that
 
01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:50.029 align:start position:0%
companies that those tips uh that that
35%

01:07:50.029 --> 01:07:50.039 align:start position:0%
35%
 
01:07:55.829 --> 01:07:55.839 align:start position:0%
will potentially be assumed by the the
 
01:07:58.349 --> 01:07:58.359 align:start position:0%
current users and the instate users so
 
01:08:01.829 --> 01:08:01.839 align:start position:0%
my my fear is that the cost to the
 
01:08:05.430 --> 01:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
instate users will go up
 
01:08:08.390 --> 01:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
and that's still a concern but I feel
 
01:08:10.990 --> 01:08:11.000 align:start position:0%
that the the benefits outweigh the cost
 
01:08:14.549 --> 01:08:14.559 align:start position:0%
and I'll I will vote OTP M chair
 
01:08:16.990 --> 01:08:17.000 align:start position:0%
representative ger thank you madam chair
 
01:08:18.030 --> 01:08:18.040 align:start position:0%
I just want to say and I hear
 
01:08:20.229 --> 01:08:20.239 align:start position:0%
representative kraton's uh concerns and
 
01:08:21.630 --> 01:08:21.640 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate his his support for the
 
01:08:23.829 --> 01:08:23.839 align:start position:0%
bill I will say that the bill uh
 
01:08:26.709 --> 01:08:26.719 align:start position:0%
grandfathers in current landfills and
 
01:08:29.430 --> 01:08:29.440 align:start position:0%
and expansions of those landfills so uh
 
01:08:31.309 --> 01:08:31.319 align:start position:0%
while there may down the road be an
 
01:08:33.269 --> 01:08:33.279 align:start position:0%
effect uh that representative kraton was
 
01:08:34.590 --> 01:08:34.600 align:start position:0%
referring to it certainly wouldn't be
 
01:08:36.070 --> 01:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
for quite a long time because our
 
01:08:38.110 --> 01:08:38.120 align:start position:0%
current landfills will continue to
 
01:08:40.510 --> 01:08:40.520 align:start position:0%
operate under the under the rules as
 
01:08:43.110 --> 01:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
they exist now so any uh any addition
 
01:08:45.309 --> 01:08:45.319 align:start position:0%
will not be for sometime down the road
 
01:08:45.319 --> 01:08:46.470 align:start position:0%
will not be for sometime down the road
representative

01:08:46.470 --> 01:08:46.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:08:48.910 --> 01:08:48.920 align:start position:0%
ktoa thank you madam chair and I want to
 
01:08:51.110 --> 01:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
thank uh represent Jamar for reminding
 
01:08:53.149 --> 01:08:53.159 align:start position:0%
us that those the landfills are
 
01:08:55.110 --> 01:08:55.120 align:start position:0%
grandfathered and are exempt for for
 
01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:57.590 align:start position:0%
grandfathered and are exempt for for
this

01:08:57.590 --> 01:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:02.229 --> 01:09:02.239 align:start position:0%
um and so I will vote OTP on this but
 
01:09:05.110 --> 01:09:05.120 align:start position:0%
because we only need one more landfill
 
01:09:07.269 --> 01:09:07.279 align:start position:0%
and if it is going to be a public
 
01:09:08.950 --> 01:09:08.960 align:start position:0%
private ownership this bill in my
 
01:09:12.070 --> 01:09:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:15.590 --> 01:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
needed representative Bixby yeah
 
01:09:19.269 --> 01:09:19.279 align:start position:0%
so um it is
 
01:09:24.950 --> 01:09:24.960 align:start position:0%
uh the um the probabilities of is
 
01:09:29.550 --> 01:09:29.560 align:start position:0%
difficult to uh gauge from the votes
 
01:09:31.110 --> 01:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
that we take in this committee the
 
01:09:35.229 --> 01:09:35.239 align:start position:0%
probability of a bill becoming law uh
 
01:09:37.070 --> 01:09:37.080 align:start position:0%
that it still needs to make it through
 
01:09:39.789 --> 01:09:39.799 align:start position:0%
several several other steps so I think
 
01:09:43.390 --> 01:09:43.400 align:start position:0%
that if we have two uh possible options
 
01:09:45.149 --> 01:09:45.159 align:start position:0%
that increases the chance that we're
 
01:09:48.910 --> 01:09:48.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:52.070 --> 01:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
problem representative Penza yeah I just
 
01:09:54.790 --> 01:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
wanted to speak to that I think that um
 
01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:55.830 align:start position:0%

01:17:59.510 --> 01:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
having that kind of schedule but um I
 
01:18:01.430 --> 01:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
want to thank everybody for their
 
01:18:04.350 --> 01:18:04.360 align:start position:0%
wonderful work and working together and
 
01:18:08.350 --> 01:18:08.360 align:start position:0%
uh it's been a great couple of months
 
01:18:10.669 --> 01:18:10.679 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby and I'd like to
 
01:18:15.189 --> 01:18:15.199 align:start position:0%
thank chair Aaron for uh the great job
 
01:18:17.270 --> 01:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
that she did in terms of organizing the
 
01:18:19.110 --> 01:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
processing of these bills I think that
 
01:18:21.629 --> 01:18:21.639 align:start position:0%
we moved through them effectively and it
 
01:18:23.070 --> 01:18:23.080 align:start position:0%
was a little bit tough when we were
 
01:18:26.030 --> 01:18:26.040 align:start position:0%
doing two two sessions a week but um I
 
01:18:28.830 --> 01:18:28.840 align:start position:0%
think that uh the way that she put
 
01:18:31.750 --> 01:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
together a a pattern of doing the
 
01:18:34.790 --> 01:18:34.800 align:start position:0%
hearings doing work sessions promptly so
 
01:18:36.310 --> 01:18:36.320 align:start position:0%
we could assess the bills and then doing
 
01:18:39.629 --> 01:18:39.639 align:start position:0%
the exacts uh really uh move things
 
01:18:41.950 --> 01:18:41.960 align:start position:0%
through very effectively thank you
 
01:18:44.590 --> 01:18:44.600 align:start position:0%
