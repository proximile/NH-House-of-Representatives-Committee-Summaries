00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:32.280 align:start position:0%
okay I'm going to call the interim study
 
00:06:36.529 --> 00:06:36.539 align:start position:0%
committee on house bill 1229 to order
 
00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:39.300 align:start position:0%
thank you very much to all of you who
 
00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:41.340 align:start position:0%
are here chairman Ladd representative
 
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
Lucas representative Hall representative

00:06:51.529 --> 00:06:51.539 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock and
 
00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
representative Ellison you asked for uh
 
00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:00.180 align:start position:0%
an explanation from the doe of the
 
00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
school meals data figures that were
 
00:07:06.529 --> 00:07:06.539 align:start position:0%
given to us at the last meeting do you
 
00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:09.780 align:start position:0%
feel that you satisfactorily
 
00:07:17.809 --> 00:07:17.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
congratulations you you have arrived

congratulations you you have arrived
Kelly

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
Kelly
 
00:07:24.589 --> 00:07:24.599 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:28.500 align:start position:0%
um what I asked that people do is to
 
00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:31.560 align:start position:0%
prepare themselves for the meeting uh by
 
00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:34.860 align:start position:0%
reading the research packet of
 
00:07:37.969 --> 00:07:37.979 align:start position:0%
information that Jennifer Ford provided
 
00:07:42.589 --> 00:07:42.599 align:start position:0%
us on the 5th of August so that we can
 
00:07:45.529 --> 00:07:45.539 align:start position:0%
take a look at where this research came
 
00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:48.680 align:start position:0%
from and what the impetus was behind it
 
00:07:53.029 --> 00:07:53.039 align:start position:0%
so at some point in time in July
 
00:07:57.170 --> 00:07:57.180 align:start position:0%
Jennifer Ford put out an email that said
 
00:07:59.629 --> 00:07:59.639 align:start position:0%
probably much to her Chagrin at this
 
00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
point if anyone needs any research done
 
00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:05.460 align:start position:0%
this would be a good time to ask for it
 
00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
because it's kind of quiet in the LLP
 
00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:09.780 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:14.360 align:start position:0%
so through some subsequent email
 
00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
I requested that Jen look at which
 
00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:24.180 align:start position:0%
states have similar demographics to New
 
00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:25.930 align:start position:0%
states have similar demographics to New
Hampshire

00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:25.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:28.800 align:start position:0%
and if she wouldn't mind doing a bit of
 
00:08:31.369 --> 00:08:31.379 align:start position:0%
a compare and contrast between what
 
00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
we're doing with food services and what
 
00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:37.020 align:start position:0%
those other states were doing so in
 
00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:38.209 align:start position:0%
those other states were doing so in
particular

00:08:38.209 --> 00:08:38.219 align:start position:0%
particular
 
00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:42.380 align:start position:0%
she looked at Delaware Maine New Mexico
 
00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
Vermont and West Virginia
 
00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:48.240 align:start position:0%
and that's the summary of information
 
00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:50.940 align:start position:0%
that you have in the memo in front of
 
00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:52.009 align:start position:0%
that you have in the memo in front of
you

00:08:52.009 --> 00:08:52.019 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:08:52.019 --> 00:08:53.530 align:start position:0%
you
so

00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:53.540 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
barring anybody feeling like they can
 
00:08:59.690 --> 00:08:59.700 align:start position:0%
quote Page by Page uh I guess what we'll
 
00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:03.420 align:start position:0%
do is just take a look at Delaware and
 
00:09:05.509 --> 00:09:05.519 align:start position:0%
see whether or not there's anything of
 
00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:07.740 align:start position:0%
interest in that information
 
00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:10.260 align:start position:0%
I for one
 
00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:11.389 align:start position:0%
I for one
um

00:09:11.389 --> 00:09:11.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:14.329 --> 00:09:14.339 align:start position:0%
was immediately taken
 
00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:17.880 align:start position:0%
that an RSA had been evidently drafted
 
00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:19.800 align:start position:0%
in Delaware that says that all public
 
00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:22.860 align:start position:0%
schools including Charter Schools must
 
00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:25.980 align:start position:0%
offer breakfast through an alternative
 
00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:29.700 align:start position:0%
service model so as we all know the use
 
00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
of that word must is exceptionally
 
00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:36.240 align:start position:0%
meaningful because it's not an option if
 
00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:40.980 align:start position:0%
if it's a must on page two the research
 
00:09:44.329 --> 00:09:44.339 align:start position:0%
goes on and looks at the state funding
 
00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
for Food Service employees in Delaware
 
00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:50.580 align:start position:0%
which again was something that was an
 
00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:52.260 align:start position:0%
interesting concept
 
00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:53.090 align:start position:0%
interesting concept
um

00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:53.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
the state supplements up to 70 percent
 
00:09:59.210 --> 00:09:59.220 align:start position:0%
of the salaries of food service staff
 
00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:02.820 align:start position:0%
with funds not derived from the school
 
00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:06.180 align:start position:0%
lunch options in particular the statute
 
00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
reads the salaries prescribed in this
 
00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:12.660 align:start position:0%
section are for school lunch manager and
 
00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:15.720 align:start position:0%
district managers and shall be paid from
 
00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:17.220 align:start position:0%
State funds
 
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
then it goes on to talk about uh where
 
00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:23.030 align:start position:0%
then it goes on to talk about uh where
the

00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
you know cafeteria staff where the cooks
 
00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:28.380 align:start position:0%
and and service people are funded from
 
00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
and that states a minimum of 25 percent
 
00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:35.060 align:start position:0%
of the salary prescribed in subsection C
 
00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:38.040 align:start position:0%
shall be paid by the state from funds
 
00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:40.140 align:start position:0%
not derived from school lunch operations
 
00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:45.300 align:start position:0%
so I I'm only assuming and jump in here
 
00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:46.260 align:start position:0%
if anybody has a different
 
00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:48.120 align:start position:0%
interpretation of it
 
00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:51.660 align:start position:0%
um I'm assuming that that funding would
 
00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:54.300 align:start position:0%
have been roadblocked for individual
 
00:10:57.290 --> 00:10:57.300 align:start position:0%
districts without
 
00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:00.540 align:start position:0%
it being subsidized to a certain extent
 
00:11:03.949 --> 00:11:03.959 align:start position:0%
from the state coffers is that how you
 
00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:19.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:33.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:42.530 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:42.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:50.949 --> 00:11:50.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:54.949 --> 00:11:54.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:54.959 --> 00:12:00.530 align:start position:0%
 
kins

00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:00.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:06.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:09.769 --> 00:12:09.779 align:start position:0%
well I'll tell you I feel a whole lot
 
00:12:12.889 --> 00:12:12.899 align:start position:0%
better about you as a whole because I
 
00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:15.180 align:start position:0%
first thought to myself well clearly
 
00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:18.240 align:start position:0%
these people have not read this page uh
 
00:12:20.449 --> 00:12:20.459 align:start position:0%
and then I thought
 
00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
well can these people read this page
 
00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:25.800 align:start position:0%
because there's nothing there's no
 
00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:29.820 align:start position:0%
feedback from either side so uh yeah so
 
00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
that state funding portion uh has to do
 
00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:35.640 align:start position:0%
with subsidizing local districts I
 
00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
believe and that's I don't think that's
 
00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:42.060 align:start position:0%
a foreign concept to us because we've
 
00:12:46.069 --> 00:12:46.079 align:start position:0%
heard about the roadblock that having to
 
00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
hire additional staff and food directors
 
00:12:55.810 --> 00:12:55.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:00.540 align:start position:0%
it was 70 for the food director and
 
00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:03.380 align:start position:0%
managers and 25
 
00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:07.860 align:start position:0%
of the cost of cooks and cafeteria
 
00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:10.129 align:start position:0%
of the cost of cooks and cafeteria
workers

00:13:10.129 --> 00:13:10.139 align:start position:0%
workers
 
00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
the other thing that Delaware did
 
00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:14.210 align:start position:0%
the other thing that Delaware did
um

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:14.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:16.500 align:start position:0%
not that I'm an idiot savant on the
 
00:13:19.069 --> 00:13:19.079 align:start position:0%
package but I did have page two in front
 
00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:21.500 align:start position:0%
of me until Jen took it
 
00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
they required that uh charter schools
 
00:13:28.129 --> 00:13:28.139 align:start position:0%
which evidently are also public in
 
00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
Delaware uh provide some sort of
 
00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
breakfast and lunch program at least to
 
00:13:38.269 --> 00:13:38.279 align:start position:0%
kids who qualify for free or reduced
 
00:13:38.279 --> 00:13:39.050 align:start position:0%
kids who qualify for free or reduced
lunch

00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:39.060 align:start position:0%
lunch
 
00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:40.250 align:start position:0%
lunch
so

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:40.260 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:42.180 align:start position:0%
I don't know how I feel about that
 
00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:45.240 align:start position:0%
because I I
 
00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:48.360 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools tend to be small
 
00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:51.420 align:start position:0%
and I don't know how you would protect
 
00:13:54.829 --> 00:13:54.839 align:start position:0%
the confidentiality of the students
 
00:13:57.050 --> 00:13:57.060 align:start position:0%
if Kelly's nodding her head back there
 
00:13:57.060 --> 00:13:59.150 align:start position:0%
if Kelly's nodding her head back there
if

00:13:59.150 --> 00:13:59.160 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:00.540 align:start position:0%
you have
 
00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
12 kids in a classroom and four of them
 
00:14:05.569 --> 00:14:05.579 align:start position:0%
have to go get their lunch from a
 
00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:07.500 align:start position:0%
cafeteria or whatever an eight of them
 
00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:09.540 align:start position:0%
or brown bag in it from home yeah
 
00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:11.940 align:start position:0%
representative fleecus
 
00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
well that actually starts on the bottom
 
00:14:17.449 --> 00:14:17.459 align:start position:0%
of page one and I notice it says all
 
00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:19.760 align:start position:0%
public schools including Charter Schools
 
00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:22.260 align:start position:0%
participating in the community eligible
 
00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
eligibility provision to offer that so
 
00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:27.480 align:start position:0%
the question is do they have the option
 
00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:30.300 align:start position:0%
of not participating
 
00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:31.980 align:start position:0%
yeah that's a good question
 
00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
it's a good question
 
00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
throughout this packet what you're going
 
00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:38.160 align:start position:0%
to find is that
 
00:14:41.629 --> 00:14:41.639 align:start position:0%
some states require that all public
 
00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:43.940 align:start position:0%
schools and or Charter Schools
 
00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:46.440 align:start position:0%
participate in the national school lunch
 
00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
program but then as soon as they require
 
00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:52.980 align:start position:0%
it they also allow for the opportunity
 
00:14:56.449 --> 00:14:56.459 align:start position:0%
to apply for waivers so I would think
 
00:14:58.129 --> 00:14:58.139 align:start position:0%
that each of those individual states
 
00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:00.660 align:start position:0%
must have some sort of threshold
 
00:15:04.129 --> 00:15:04.139 align:start position:0%
Financial threshold by which they're
 
00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
judging what
 
00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:09.480 align:start position:0%
actually presents as an undue burden on
 
00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
a local District because on the one hand
 
00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:13.980 align:start position:0%
they're saying You must participate and
 
00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:16.500 align:start position:0%
then on the other hand but using myself
 
00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
as an example
 
00:15:20.689 --> 00:15:20.699 align:start position:0%
Bedford New Hampshire is not going to
 
00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:24.540 align:start position:0%
apply for a waiver and have it granted
 
00:15:27.889 --> 00:15:27.899 align:start position:0%
if they choose not to participate in the
 
00:15:29.569 --> 00:15:29.579 align:start position:0%
National lunch program
 
00:15:29.579 --> 00:15:31.250 align:start position:0%
National lunch program
however

00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:31.260 align:start position:0%
however
 
00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:34.260 align:start position:0%
someone else's Community might very well
 
00:15:37.129 --> 00:15:37.139 align:start position:0%
you know whether it's uh property values
 
00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:40.920 align:start position:0%
or the burden of the school budget on
 
00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:42.540 align:start position:0%
the community or whatever they may in
 
00:15:44.389 --> 00:15:44.399 align:start position:0%
fact qualify
 
00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:46.740 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Jen
 
00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:48.720 align:start position:0%
lucky thing you came to see us today
 
00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:50.829 align:start position:0%
lucky thing you came to see us today
John

00:15:50.829 --> 00:15:50.839 align:start position:0%
John
 
00:15:53.629 --> 00:15:53.639 align:start position:0%
Wallace is the question that will sort
 
00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:55.680 align:start position:0%
of fall up in your commentary
 
00:15:59.810 --> 00:15:59.820 align:start position:0%
um we we now have those uh I think it's
 
00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:02.760 align:start position:0%
40 schools or 30 schools
 
00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:04.860 align:start position:0%
um 30 45th exact number somewhere
 
00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:07.620 align:start position:0%
between those two uh that do participate
 
00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:11.820 align:start position:0%
in our lunch program but yet out of
 
00:16:13.189 --> 00:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
participating in The Breakfast program
 
00:16:16.189 --> 00:16:16.199 align:start position:0%
correct so there has to be some uh thank
 
00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:17.880 align:start position:0%
you again it has to be some way that
 
00:16:18.949 --> 00:16:18.959 align:start position:0%
they do that
 
00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:21.000 align:start position:0%
you know they have that option well I
 
00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:22.620 align:start position:0%
don't think it's mandatory though but
 
00:16:26.389 --> 00:16:26.399 align:start position:0%
the uh and certainly if um the doe wants
 
00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:28.500 align:start position:0%
to chime in on this feel free to jump up
 
00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:30.420 align:start position:0%
at the microphone
 
00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:34.980 align:start position:0%
um but it's not in in these statutes it
 
00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:37.800 align:start position:0%
says it's mandatory to participate in
 
00:16:40.249 --> 00:16:40.259 align:start position:0%
the school lunch program and in many of
 
00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:43.560 align:start position:0%
the states it's mandatory if you offer a
 
00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:45.240 align:start position:0%
lunch program then you must offer
 
00:16:47.569 --> 00:16:47.579 align:start position:0%
breakfast but that's not in our current
 
00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:51.240 align:start position:0%
statute so uh it's optional and that was
 
00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:52.860 align:start position:0%
that was something that was moving down
 
00:16:59.329 --> 00:16:59.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:02.100 align:start position:0%
so in Maine all public schools must
 
00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:04.079 align:start position:0%
participate in the national school lunch
 
00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:06.780 align:start position:0%
program but there's an exemption for
 
00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:10.079 align:start position:0%
secondary schools and grades 9 through
 
00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
12. in a subsection of the statute so
 
00:17:17.449 --> 00:17:17.459 align:start position:0%
again you know there I I believe that
 
00:17:19.610 --> 00:17:19.620 align:start position:0%
the spirit of that is in reading the
 
00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
statute is to allow for communities that
 
00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:27.480 align:start position:0%
prove that they can sustain a program to
 
00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:30.780 align:start position:0%
be required to do so but in communities
 
00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:33.960 align:start position:0%
where in in some of the states it's you
 
00:17:36.409 --> 00:17:36.419 align:start position:0%
know if more than 80 percent of the kids
 
00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:38.460 align:start position:0%
in the school district qualify for free
 
00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:41.400 align:start position:0%
and reduced lunch then they can in fact
 
00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:44.340 align:start position:0%
be waived off but I think it goes like
 
00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:49.250 align:start position:0%
 
Maine

00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:49.260 align:start position:0%
Maine
 
00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
um if you I did not photocopy all of the
 
00:17:56.570 --> 00:17:56.580 align:start position:0%
literature that Jen provided from the
 
00:17:58.610 --> 00:17:58.620 align:start position:0%
main statutes you have them
 
00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
electronically in email that I sent out
 
00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:07.320 align:start position:0%
to you on or around August 5th or 6th
 
00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
somewhere in there
 
00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:10.610 align:start position:0%
somewhere in there
um

00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:10.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
it's there for you to go back and and
 
00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
look through because I think the
 
00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
language is fairly interesting and
 
00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
certainly will be moving forward for us
 
00:18:26.289 --> 00:18:26.299 align:start position:0%
but uh Maine has instituted a universal
 
00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:29.700 align:start position:0%
no-cost School meals program
 
00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:31.190 align:start position:0%
no-cost School meals program
so

00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:31.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:34.260 align:start position:0%
there's uh in the literature that is not
 
00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:36.720 align:start position:0%
here but you do have electronically are
 
00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
the fiscal statement on it I think it
 
00:18:42.169 --> 00:18:42.179 align:start position:0%
was 34 million was the 34 million in
 
00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:44.280 align:start position:0%
change right Nancy's nodding her head uh
 
00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:49.080 align:start position:0%
was the was the total on on no cost
 
00:18:55.610 --> 00:18:55.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:59.510 --> 00:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
they also uh established something
 
00:19:04.789 --> 00:19:04.799 align:start position:0%
called the meals for students fund which
 
00:19:07.909 --> 00:19:07.919 align:start position:0%
is a non-lapsing dedicated fund within
 
00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:10.020 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education
 
00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:12.780 align:start position:0%
to provide funds for the cost to the
 
00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:15.900 align:start position:0%
state to pay the difference between the
 
00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
federal reimbursement
 
00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:19.860 align:start position:0%
for a free breakfast or lunch and the
 
00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:22.740 align:start position:0%
full price of breakfast or lunch for
 
00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:26.340 align:start position:0%
students that are ineligible for free or
 
00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:28.620 align:start position:0%
reduced let me say that again because
 
00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:30.660 align:start position:0%
there are so many eligibles and
 
00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
ineligibles when you're looking at the
 
00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
universal meals program there are kids
 
00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
that would qualify for
 
00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:42.240 align:start position:0%
free lunch so schools would be
 
00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:44.460 align:start position:0%
reimbursed full amounts for them the
 
00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
federal full amount there are kids that
 
00:19:51.650 --> 00:19:51.660 align:start position:0%
are eligible for reduced cost meals and
 
00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:53.580 align:start position:0%
therefore the government the federal
 
00:19:57.130 --> 00:19:57.140 align:start position:0%
government would reimburse at that rate
 
00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:00.900 align:start position:0%
Then There are kids that are ineligible
 
00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
for free and reduced meals that's
 
00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
basically everybody else so this fund
 
00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:10.940 align:start position:0%
this meals for student fund was
 
00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:15.660 align:start position:0%
established to come up with the funding
 
00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:18.470 align:start position:0%
established to come up with the funding
mechanism

00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:22.860 align:start position:0%
for the state to use to fund meals for
 
00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:25.860 align:start position:0%
kids that are not being reimbursed from
 
00:20:28.909 --> 00:20:28.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:31.490 --> 00:20:31.500 align:start position:0%
at least that's my read on it if you'll
 
00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
remember correctly I asked Jennifer at
 
00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:35.640 align:start position:0%
the last meeting if she was prepared to
 
00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:38.700 align:start position:0%
answer any questions on This research
 
00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:40.610 align:start position:0%
answer any questions on This research
um

00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:40.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:42.360 align:start position:0%
she would have to be she would have to
 
00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
be a full-time expert in school meals
 
00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:47.340 align:start position:0%
programs Nationwide to be able to answer
 
00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
these questions so I think it was
 
00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
somewhat of an unrealistic ask but
 
00:20:57.650 --> 00:20:57.660 align:start position:0%
Jen jump in if I present to anything
 
00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:00.780 align:start position:0%
that you take issue with will you jump
 
00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:09.970 align:start position:0%
that you take issue with will you jump
okay

00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:09.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
well you may be digging
 
00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
um for different reasons it may not be
 
00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
for this study committee you may be
 
00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:20.100 align:start position:0%
digging for the people that come after
 
00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:22.610 align:start position:0%
digging for the people that come after
us

00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:22.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:26.450 --> 00:21:26.460 align:start position:0%
the other thing that Maine is looking at
 
00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:28.860 align:start position:0%
uh is
 
00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:33.480 align:start position:0%
providing summer Food Services which
 
00:21:36.649 --> 00:21:36.659 align:start position:0%
was part of the covet relief effort you
 
00:21:38.029 --> 00:21:38.039 align:start position:0%
know kids were getting food right
 
00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:41.460 align:start position:0%
through the summer now that New
 
00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is no longer particip well the
 
00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:47.220 align:start position:0%
program Ended as of September 30th and
 
00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:50.520 align:start position:0%
we uh did not
 
00:21:53.169 --> 00:21:53.179 align:start position:0%
fill out applications to continue
 
00:21:58.610 --> 00:21:58.620 align:start position:0%
through any of the available means so
 
00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:01.140 align:start position:0%
moving through the future that means
 
00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
that summer meals you know would not be
 
00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:05.580 align:start position:0%
offered that they would end with the
 
00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:08.280 align:start position:0%
school year unless uh
 
00:22:11.570 --> 00:22:11.580 align:start position:0%
uh unless other Provisions had been had
 
00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:14.760 align:start position:0%
been made in some schools some schools
 
00:22:18.649 --> 00:22:18.659 align:start position:0%
qualify for summer meal programs because
 
00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
of the population
 
00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:23.240 align:start position:0%
but again it's that
 
00:22:26.029 --> 00:22:26.039 align:start position:0%
you know if you're hungry and your
 
00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:27.960 align:start position:0%
parents make
 
00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:30.360 align:start position:0%
thirty eight thousand dollars a year for
 
00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:32.820 align:start position:0%
a family for it does that mean that you
 
00:22:35.810 --> 00:22:35.820 align:start position:0%
you know you're ineligible to be fed
 
00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:41.580 align:start position:0%
yeah under under current law does so uh
 
00:22:43.730 --> 00:22:43.740 align:start position:0%
we'll have to take a look at that at
 
00:22:46.130 --> 00:22:46.140 align:start position:0%
some point in time jump in here you guys
 
00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:48.360 align:start position:0%
if you have any questions or comments to
 
00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:53.930 align:start position:0%
if you have any questions or comments to
uh

00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:53.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:58.370 --> 00:22:58.380 align:start position:0%
they also main look at look at the state
 
00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
domain name is it's their model the way
 
00:23:04.549 --> 00:23:04.559 align:start position:0%
life ought to be is that
 
00:23:04.559 --> 00:23:06.049 align:start position:0%
life ought to be is that
uh

00:23:06.049 --> 00:23:06.059 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:08.820 align:start position:0%
their former moral correct that that was
 
00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:10.740 align:start position:0%
that well they also had those signs that
 
00:23:12.409 --> 00:23:12.419 align:start position:0%
on the highway that said stay alert
 
00:23:14.930 --> 00:23:14.940 align:start position:0%
which I thought were pretty important as
 
00:23:17.149 --> 00:23:17.159 align:start position:0%
well the people from New Hampshire yes
 
00:23:22.370 --> 00:23:22.380 align:start position:0%
exactly wake up uh they established a
 
00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
local produce fund
 
00:23:29.570 --> 00:23:29.580 align:start position:0%
under 20 a main revive statute the local
 
00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:33.960 align:start position:0%
food fund which I think you know we we
 
00:23:37.130 --> 00:23:37.140 align:start position:0%
heard from our own uh Farm to school
 
00:23:39.649 --> 00:23:39.659 align:start position:0%
people last time we met
 
00:23:43.490 --> 00:23:43.500 align:start position:0%
and I believe that a lot of what they
 
00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:45.900 align:start position:0%
were proposing through the bill that did
 
00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:47.820 align:start position:0%
not go through last time around but
 
00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
we're likely to see again is uh in Maine
 
00:23:55.330 --> 00:23:55.340 align:start position:0%
it's a five thousand dollar per School
 
00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:57.110 align:start position:0%
it's a five thousand dollar per School
allocation

00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
allocation
 
00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:01.620 align:start position:0%
if you purchase foods from local theirs
 
00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:05.400 align:start position:0%
is very specific in the sense that uh
 
00:24:08.029 --> 00:24:08.039 align:start position:0%
it's from a farmer a farmer's
 
00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:10.020 align:start position:0%
Cooperative a local food Hub a local
 
00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
food processor or Food Service
 
00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:15.049 align:start position:0%
food processor or Food Service
distributor

00:24:15.049 --> 00:24:15.059 align:start position:0%
distributor
 
00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:17.940 align:start position:0%
and it's only to be used to purchase
 
00:24:21.289 --> 00:24:21.299 align:start position:0%
Foods grown or produced in Maine
 
00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
it's authorized to accept public and
 
00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
private Revenue so again they're looking
 
00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
for alternative funding sources
 
00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:32.820 align:start position:0%
and it's not lapsing so I can't imagine
 
00:24:34.490 --> 00:24:34.500 align:start position:0%
that it would lapse anyhow if you're
 
00:24:38.149 --> 00:24:38.159 align:start position:0%
talking about five thousand dollars but
 
00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:41.700 align:start position:0%
but that it looks to they look to be uh
 
00:24:44.570 --> 00:24:44.580 align:start position:0%
somebody who Maine looks to be somebody
 
00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:46.500 align:start position:0%
who's put looks to be a state that's
 
00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:53.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:55.669 --> 00:24:55.679 align:start position:0%
dungeons or comments on Delaware and
 
00:24:55.679 --> 00:24:58.450 align:start position:0%
dungeons or comments on Delaware and
Maine

00:24:58.450 --> 00:24:58.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:01.740 align:start position:0%
representative Ellison or more general
 
00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:05.220 align:start position:0%
question Madam chair could you refresh
 
00:25:07.850 --> 00:25:07.860 align:start position:0%
our memory as in in terms of the charge
 
00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:10.020 align:start position:0%
of this subcommittee and what what is
 
00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
expected or what alternatives might be
 
00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:14.820 align:start position:0%
expected at the end of this well it's an
 
00:25:16.970 --> 00:25:16.980 align:start position:0%
interesting question because you know I
 
00:25:19.789 --> 00:25:19.799 align:start position:0%
laughed early on about the study
 
00:25:21.649 --> 00:25:21.659 align:start position:0%
committee to determine if we needed a
 
00:25:23.450 --> 00:25:23.460 align:start position:0%
study committee
 
00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:26.760 align:start position:0%
it's not seeming so funny anymore now it
 
00:25:28.970 --> 00:25:28.980 align:start position:0%
seems like the study committee may be
 
00:25:32.269 --> 00:25:32.279 align:start position:0%
recommending that we need a continued
 
00:25:36.289 --> 00:25:36.299 align:start position:0%
study committee our charge is uh to
 
00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:40.740 align:start position:0%
basically say yes or no
 
00:25:43.610 --> 00:25:43.620 align:start position:0%
to recommending future legislation
 
00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
we do not have to write the legislation
 
00:25:48.769 --> 00:25:48.779 align:start position:0%
we can make recommendations in fact
 
00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:51.240 align:start position:0%
chairman Ladd who I sought some advice
 
00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
from at one point in time said that um
 
00:25:57.649 --> 00:25:57.659 align:start position:0%
yes that if in fact you're moving
 
00:25:59.750 --> 00:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
forward with a with a recommendation for
 
00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
yes then it would be helpful to uh
 
00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:07.140 align:start position:0%
gather the committee's thoughts and talk
 
00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:08.169 align:start position:0%
gather the committee's thoughts and talk
about

00:26:08.169 --> 00:26:08.179 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:11.700 align:start position:0%
potential legislative areas that we
 
00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
might want to devote some time to
 
00:26:16.250 --> 00:26:16.260 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question it's very
 
00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:19.020 align:start position:0%
helpful thank you
 
00:26:20.769 --> 00:26:20.779 align:start position:0%
chairman Ladd
 
00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:23.820 align:start position:0%
in looking at several of these which you
 
00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:25.860 align:start position:0%
haven't come to yet but uh including
 
00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:26.930 align:start position:0%
haven't come to yet but uh including
Delaware

00:26:26.930 --> 00:26:26.940 align:start position:0%
Delaware
 
00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:29.220 align:start position:0%
there's a requirement that the state
 
00:26:32.149 --> 00:26:32.159 align:start position:0%
supplement up to 70 or the others in
 
00:26:32.159 --> 00:26:33.049 align:start position:0%
supplement up to 70 or the others in
Delaware

00:26:33.049 --> 00:26:33.059 align:start position:0%
Delaware
 
00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:36.120 align:start position:0%
where are the dollars and are these
 
00:26:38.090 --> 00:26:38.100 align:start position:0%
people that are working in this program
 
00:26:41.149 --> 00:26:41.159 align:start position:0%
eligible for State retirement are they
 
00:26:43.130 --> 00:26:43.140 align:start position:0%
eligible for the benefits within the
 
00:26:44.690 --> 00:26:44.700 align:start position:0%
school district that there may be
 
00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:48.720 align:start position:0%
working maybe I.E Medical Dental
 
00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
um those would be added costs which
 
00:26:54.649 --> 00:26:54.659 align:start position:0%
would be captured
 
00:26:57.049 --> 00:26:57.059 align:start position:0%
in in some states by the local other
 
00:26:58.490 --> 00:26:58.500 align:start position:0%
states partially by the local and
 
00:27:00.649 --> 00:27:00.659 align:start position:0%
partially by the state but is something
 
00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:03.960 align:start position:0%
we should get a handle on as far as the
 
00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
retirement how's that you know because
 
00:27:07.549 --> 00:27:07.559 align:start position:0%
that's always something that's coming to
 
00:27:11.570 --> 00:27:11.580 align:start position:0%
haunt us dealing with the teacher system
 
00:27:14.529 --> 00:27:14.539 align:start position:0%
right now the police fire
 
00:27:17.390 --> 00:27:17.400 align:start position:0%
community college system definitely has
 
00:27:20.930 --> 00:27:20.940 align:start position:0%
got an issue with that so um
 
00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:24.240 align:start position:0%
yeah that's an area which you should you
 
00:27:25.850 --> 00:27:25.860 align:start position:0%
know if you're going to move something
 
00:27:28.669 --> 00:27:28.679 align:start position:0%
forward put that as a concern that the
 
00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:30.120 align:start position:0%
state's going to be working where's
 
00:27:31.610 --> 00:27:31.620 align:start position:0%
where's the retirement and how they
 
00:27:36.010 --> 00:27:36.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
I I don't have an answer to your
 
00:27:40.850 --> 00:27:40.860 align:start position:0%
question but I recognize the importance
 
00:27:51.490 --> 00:27:51.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:53.690 --> 00:27:53.700 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock thank you uh
 
00:27:56.149 --> 00:27:56.159 align:start position:0%
default from representative comment um
 
00:27:58.310 --> 00:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
wouldn't their assumption wreck be that
 
00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:01.200 align:start position:0%
whatever these I'm just asking whatever
 
00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:03.240 align:start position:0%
the school district currently is doing
 
00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
for their their culinary staff would
 
00:28:07.909 --> 00:28:07.919 align:start position:0%
continue in terms of if they pay every
 
00:28:10.190 --> 00:28:10.200 align:start position:0%
time if they pay in why would that
 
00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:11.690 align:start position:0%
time if they pay in why would that
change

00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:11.700 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:28:14.029 --> 00:28:14.039 align:start position:0%
well you're adding to the program it's
 
00:28:15.169 --> 00:28:15.179 align:start position:0%
not something will you turn your
 
00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:17.940 align:start position:0%
microphone on your answer to the program
 
00:28:21.289 --> 00:28:21.299 align:start position:0%
by way of a state statute
 
00:28:25.549 --> 00:28:25.559 align:start position:0%
and the local benefits the packages for
 
00:28:28.370 --> 00:28:28.380 align:start position:0%
medical and dental and all usually and
 
00:28:31.909 --> 00:28:31.919 align:start position:0%
always come from the local so you're
 
00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
talking about the local having to
 
00:28:36.649 --> 00:28:36.659 align:start position:0%
contribute some dollars to this as well
 
00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:39.240 align:start position:0%
um who's going to make the decision
 
00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:41.880 align:start position:0%
um yeah it may the local may say well
 
00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:43.200 align:start position:0%
we'll just tie it in but that's there's
 
00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:44.940 align:start position:0%
going to be an additional cost depending
 
00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
upon the type of system you've set up
 
00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
certainly the person that's employed is
 
00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
going to have to contribute some to it
 
00:28:56.710 --> 00:28:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:59.090 --> 00:28:59.100 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm a little confused my
 
00:29:01.850 --> 00:29:01.860 align:start position:0%
thinking is if I'm working 30 hours a
 
00:29:04.789 --> 00:29:04.799 align:start position:0%
week in school X right now and as a
 
00:29:06.769 --> 00:29:06.779 align:start position:0%
member of the The Culinary staff in the
 
00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
kitchen and say the chef whatever
 
00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:12.120 align:start position:0%
um and they're they're providing x
 
00:29:15.010 --> 00:29:15.020 align:start position:0%
amount of meals and for 30 hours a week
 
00:29:17.570 --> 00:29:17.580 align:start position:0%
and next year the year after year
 
00:29:20.570 --> 00:29:20.580 align:start position:0%
afterward they change the uh funding
 
00:29:22.490 --> 00:29:22.500 align:start position:0%
mechanism but that's not going to change
 
00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:25.080 align:start position:0%
my 30 a week if my hours don't expend
 
00:29:27.409 --> 00:29:27.419 align:start position:0%
this there's a contract for the culinary
 
00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:30.240 align:start position:0%
folks and the the cafeteria folks what
 
00:29:31.730 --> 00:29:31.740 align:start position:0%
they already have so if nothing's going
 
00:29:34.130 --> 00:29:34.140 align:start position:0%
to change except how it's funded I don't
 
00:29:35.210 --> 00:29:35.220 align:start position:0%
understand why that would change the
 
00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
local contribution if they don't offer
 
00:29:39.169 --> 00:29:39.179 align:start position:0%
Dental now they don't offer medical now
 
00:29:41.149 --> 00:29:41.159 align:start position:0%
which they may but if they don't I mean
 
00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:42.360 align:start position:0%
that would be a whole new contract
 
00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:44.830 align:start position:0%
that would be a whole new contract
correct

00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:44.840 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:29:48.649 --> 00:29:48.659 align:start position:0%
I think we ought to look at okay uh we
 
00:29:50.149 --> 00:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
we're seeing that when we're looking at
 
00:29:52.250 --> 00:29:52.260 align:start position:0%
teacher shortages right now retirements
 
00:29:54.769 --> 00:29:54.779 align:start position:0%
come up to be an issue okay uh that we
 
00:29:57.289 --> 00:29:57.299 align:start position:0%
need to look at uh there's a lot of
 
00:29:58.370 --> 00:29:58.380 align:start position:0%
different ways of doing this could be
 
00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:00.720 align:start position:0%
through contract and services okay
 
00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:02.520 align:start position:0%
um and that could be buried into the the
 
00:30:04.909 --> 00:30:04.919 align:start position:0%
labor costs yeah I think all right so
 
00:30:06.409 --> 00:30:06.419 align:start position:0%
it's a point I think you're both right
 
00:30:09.649 --> 00:30:09.659 align:start position:0%
right I think that if additional staff
 
00:30:12.289 --> 00:30:12.299 align:start position:0%
is needed because we're expanding
 
00:30:14.330 --> 00:30:14.340 align:start position:0%
breakfasts and the number of kids that
 
00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:16.260 align:start position:0%
are being fed at lunch or whatever then
 
00:30:18.769 --> 00:30:18.779 align:start position:0%
we have to be mindful of whether or not
 
00:30:20.990 --> 00:30:21.000 align:start position:0%
there are benefit and retirement
 
00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.610 align:start position:0%
there are benefit and retirement
implications

00:30:22.610 --> 00:30:22.620 align:start position:0%
implications
 
00:30:26.450 --> 00:30:26.460 align:start position:0%
uh if additional staff is not needed
 
00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:29.360 align:start position:0%
then it shouldn't affect it right and
 
00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:31.440 align:start position:0%
correct and it's nice to hear that
 
00:30:33.370 --> 00:30:33.380 align:start position:0%
representative both corrected
 
00:30:35.930 --> 00:30:35.940 align:start position:0%
you're you're both yeah you're both
 
00:30:37.789 --> 00:30:37.799 align:start position:0%
correct oh we agree on many things out
 
00:30:38.690 --> 00:30:38.700 align:start position:0%
of here
 
00:30:41.029 --> 00:30:41.039 align:start position:0%
um but that that being said that the
 
00:30:43.970 --> 00:30:43.980 align:start position:0%
staff um representative Mullen that
 
00:30:46.130 --> 00:30:46.140 align:start position:0%
you're talking about
 
00:30:48.649 --> 00:30:48.659 align:start position:0%
there is a contract in place uh already
 
00:30:51.649 --> 00:30:51.659 align:start position:0%
in these school systems so whatever I
 
00:30:52.730 --> 00:30:52.740 align:start position:0%
guess my point is whatever they're
 
00:30:55.010 --> 00:30:55.020 align:start position:0%
offering now is local costs they've only
 
00:30:57.409 --> 00:30:57.419 align:start position:0%
seem to be extended if in fact we extend
 
00:30:58.909 --> 00:30:58.919 align:start position:0%
the hours to add new staff for local
 
00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
thoughts correct it doesn't mean that
 
00:31:02.389 --> 00:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
they necessarily have to get a a benefit
 
00:31:04.610 --> 00:31:04.620 align:start position:0%
uh like I say dental insurance they
 
00:31:06.409 --> 00:31:06.419 align:start position:0%
aren't getting it now right okay that's
 
00:31:08.570 --> 00:31:08.580 align:start position:0%
my point yes okay thank you thank you
 
00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:10.640 align:start position:0%
representatively constitu have a comment
 
00:31:12.529 --> 00:31:12.539 align:start position:0%
well I was
 
00:31:15.649 --> 00:31:15.659 align:start position:0%
I'm just gonna say that yes if they're
 
00:31:18.409 --> 00:31:18.419 align:start position:0%
not hiring new staff but if they're
 
00:31:20.690 --> 00:31:20.700 align:start position:0%
putting but if they are hiring new staff
 
00:31:23.570 --> 00:31:23.580 align:start position:0%
that's a cost we have mandated to the
 
00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
local people and are we you know Mandy
 
00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:30.360 align:start position:0%
are we mandating they spend money
 
00:31:32.750 --> 00:31:32.760 align:start position:0%
without providing the money for it and
 
00:31:35.029 --> 00:31:35.039 align:start position:0%
so that's the question if all of the
 
00:31:37.789 --> 00:31:37.799 align:start position:0%
people if their contract says they get
 
00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:40.200 align:start position:0%
medical and dental and now they have to
 
00:31:42.289 --> 00:31:42.299 align:start position:0%
hire two more staff because we've told
 
00:31:45.289 --> 00:31:45.299 align:start position:0%
them they had to provide breakfast
 
00:31:47.210 --> 00:31:47.220 align:start position:0%
who's paying
 
00:31:49.970 --> 00:31:49.980 align:start position:0%
for that additional cost that they're
 
00:31:51.470 --> 00:31:51.480 align:start position:0%
going to have that's the question we
 
00:31:54.649 --> 00:31:54.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:58.730 --> 00:31:58.740 align:start position:0%
okay rapidly moving on to New Mexico
 
00:32:01.730 --> 00:32:01.740 align:start position:0%
breakfast after the Bell required in
 
00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
certain schools
 
00:32:07.190 --> 00:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
namely schools that have 85 percent or
 
00:32:09.590 --> 00:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
more of their student body that is
 
00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:17.330 --> 00:32:17.340 align:start position:0%
funding for breakfast after the Bell
 
00:32:19.730 --> 00:32:19.740 align:start position:0%
again this is one
 
00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:21.289 align:start position:0%
again this is one
um

00:32:21.289 --> 00:32:21.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:25.250 --> 00:32:25.260 align:start position:0%
where the state is establishing they
 
00:32:27.529 --> 00:32:27.539 align:start position:0%
evidently have a pot of money
 
00:32:31.090 --> 00:32:31.100 align:start position:0%
and what they've said is that the
 
00:32:34.190 --> 00:32:34.200 align:start position:0%
disbursements of the funding is going to
 
00:32:37.610 --> 00:32:37.620 align:start position:0%
be based on the percentage of kids in
 
00:32:39.529 --> 00:32:39.539 align:start position:0%
the building that qualify for free and
 
00:32:42.169 --> 00:32:42.179 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch so your neediest buildings
 
00:32:45.529 --> 00:32:45.539 align:start position:0%
are going to get money first
 
00:32:48.049 --> 00:32:48.059 align:start position:0%
with the idea that it's uh that
 
00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
disbursement is done on a needs basis
 
00:32:56.029 --> 00:32:56.039 align:start position:0%
which is again an interesting
 
00:32:59.510 --> 00:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
concept and I have more questions than
 
00:33:02.389 --> 00:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
the answer is when I when I read that
 
00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:04.860 align:start position:0%
uh no question for you in that one Sue
 
00:33:07.850 --> 00:33:07.860 align:start position:0%
yes sir um if you're looking at for
 
00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:11.340 align:start position:0%
example how we are reimbursing schools
 
00:33:12.649 --> 00:33:12.659 align:start position:0%
for tuition the Career Technical
 
00:33:14.810 --> 00:33:14.820 align:start position:0%
education centers
 
00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
um if there are more kids that are
 
00:33:18.289 --> 00:33:18.299 align:start position:0%
qualifying than the previous year of
 
00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
course you're gonna have to pay more for
 
00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:21.720 align:start position:0%
tuition but we allocate blank nine
 
00:33:24.289 --> 00:33:24.299 align:start position:0%
million dollars a year so the way we're
 
00:33:26.210 --> 00:33:26.220 align:start position:0%
allocating those tuition dollars after
 
00:33:30.169 --> 00:33:30.179 align:start position:0%
we pay transportation is by a prorated
 
00:33:32.570 --> 00:33:32.580 align:start position:0%
or a proportionate amount if we divide
 
00:33:34.549 --> 00:33:34.559 align:start position:0%
the number of students in you may the
 
00:33:36.409 --> 00:33:36.419 align:start position:0%
state may say we're supposed to allocate
 
00:33:39.769 --> 00:33:39.779 align:start position:0%
75 percent of tuition but in fact it's
 
00:33:42.889 --> 00:33:42.899 align:start position:0%
only 62 percent so there is a difference
 
00:33:42.899 --> 00:33:44.149 align:start position:0%
only 62 percent so there is a difference
there

00:33:44.149 --> 00:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
um but if I were one of those districts
 
00:33:49.130 --> 00:33:49.140 align:start position:0%
that had this program and I'm the you
 
00:33:50.570 --> 00:33:50.580 align:start position:0%
know the on the bottom side of there
 
00:33:52.190 --> 00:33:52.200 align:start position:0%
where our percentage of free and reduced
 
00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:54.120 align:start position:0%
in the building is a smaller number but
 
00:33:57.830 --> 00:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
I'm still having to serve students and
 
00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
have the staff there the same staff
 
00:34:01.789 --> 00:34:01.799 align:start position:0%
there to cook and all that
 
00:34:04.490 --> 00:34:04.500 align:start position:0%
I'd be kind of you know concerned that
 
00:34:05.570 --> 00:34:05.580 align:start position:0%
I'm not getting any of that
 
00:34:07.310 --> 00:34:07.320 align:start position:0%
reimbursement because you ran out of the
 
00:34:09.829 --> 00:34:09.839 align:start position:0%
money in the pot so if you if we go
 
00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
forward the program right here I'd like
 
00:34:13.609 --> 00:34:13.619 align:start position:0%
to make sure that all programs are
 
00:34:17.329 --> 00:34:17.339 align:start position:0%
supporting you uh the the school to that
 
00:34:20.690 --> 00:34:20.700 align:start position:0%
has those type of students in it uh it's
 
00:34:22.430 --> 00:34:22.440 align:start position:0%
just going to be probably a good
 
00:34:24.409 --> 00:34:24.419 align:start position:0%
rationale for the district to be upset
 
00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:26.580 align:start position:0%
if they don't receive that money and to
 
00:34:30.190 --> 00:34:30.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:32.629 --> 00:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:34:35.930 --> 00:34:35.940 align:start position:0%
uh the next point out of the New Mexico
 
00:34:38.089 --> 00:34:38.099 align:start position:0%
research that I would draw your
 
00:34:41.389 --> 00:34:41.399 align:start position:0%
attention to is a point that seems to be
 
00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:44.720 align:start position:0%
uh fairly popular in a number of states
 
00:34:47.389 --> 00:34:47.399 align:start position:0%
and that is
 
00:34:50.210 --> 00:34:50.220 align:start position:0%
providing no-cost meals breakfast and
 
00:34:53.869 --> 00:34:53.879 align:start position:0%
lunch for kids who are eligible for
 
00:34:53.879 --> 00:34:55.550 align:start position:0%
lunch for kids who are eligible for
reduced

00:34:55.550 --> 00:34:55.560 align:start position:0%
reduced
 
00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:56.930 align:start position:0%
reduced
meals

00:34:56.930 --> 00:34:56.940 align:start position:0%
meals
 
00:34:59.930 --> 00:34:59.940 align:start position:0%
so rather in other words eliminating
 
00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:03.720 align:start position:0%
basically the reduced meal category and
 
00:35:06.349 --> 00:35:06.359 align:start position:0%
just making it a
 
00:35:09.230 --> 00:35:09.240 align:start position:0%
free meal for anybody who qualifies for
 
00:35:13.370 --> 00:35:13.380 align:start position:0%
either free or reduced uh
 
00:35:16.250 --> 00:35:16.260 align:start position:0%
and the again the the funding for that
 
00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
the the department shall provide funding
 
00:35:21.410 --> 00:35:21.420 align:start position:0%
to each School District that administers
 
00:35:24.170 --> 00:35:24.180 align:start position:0%
such a program
 
00:35:27.530 --> 00:35:27.540 align:start position:0%
and when calculating the amount due if a
 
00:35:30.410 --> 00:35:30.420 align:start position:0%
school district or Charter School is not
 
00:35:32.569 --> 00:35:32.579 align:start position:0%
previously had a program
 
00:35:34.849 --> 00:35:34.859 align:start position:0%
the department will work with the school
 
00:35:37.430 --> 00:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
to determine an accurate estimate of
 
00:35:39.890 --> 00:35:39.900 align:start position:0%
funding for the program
 
00:35:42.109 --> 00:35:42.119 align:start position:0%
that means you're going to be hiring six
 
00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:49.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:52.250 --> 00:35:52.260 align:start position:0%
concept that I of
 
00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:54.589 align:start position:0%
concept that I of
um

00:35:54.589 --> 00:35:54.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:59.690 --> 00:35:59.700 align:start position:0%
the stigma of free and reduced meals is
 
00:36:02.270 --> 00:36:02.280 align:start position:0%
something that we talked about at length
 
00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
during the last session and you know if
 
00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:09.240 align:start position:0%
there is a way that students can
 
00:36:12.130 --> 00:36:12.140 align:start position:0%
who qualify can receive meals without
 
00:36:14.990 --> 00:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
having to have attention drawn to
 
00:36:16.490 --> 00:36:16.500 align:start position:0%
themselves because they're in one
 
00:36:18.050 --> 00:36:18.060 align:start position:0%
category or the other depending upon
 
00:36:20.930 --> 00:36:20.940 align:start position:0%
what the price tag is then I think we
 
00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:21.950 align:start position:0%
what the price tag is then I think we
certainly

00:36:21.950 --> 00:36:21.960 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
00:36:24.950 --> 00:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
could consider that
 
00:36:27.470 --> 00:36:27.480 align:start position:0%
all right moving on to Vermont
 
00:36:29.810 --> 00:36:29.820 align:start position:0%
all public schools must participate in
 
00:36:32.089 --> 00:36:32.099 align:start position:0%
the National lunch program and the
 
00:36:35.810 --> 00:36:35.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:38.450 --> 00:36:38.460 align:start position:0%
no cost breakfast and lunches for
 
00:36:40.490 --> 00:36:40.500 align:start position:0%
students eligible for reduced price
 
00:36:43.370 --> 00:36:43.380 align:start position:0%
meals there it is again so now that was
 
00:36:45.950 --> 00:36:45.960 align:start position:0%
that was just what I was referring to in
 
00:36:48.050 --> 00:36:48.060 align:start position:0%
New Mexico and now Vermont is doing the
 
00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:50.280 align:start position:0%
same thing
 
00:36:55.849 --> 00:36:55.859 align:start position:0%
uh 20 22 2023 free breakfast and lunches
 
00:36:59.870 --> 00:36:59.880 align:start position:0%
for all public school students so
 
00:37:03.170 --> 00:37:03.180 align:start position:0%
they extended
 
00:37:06.589 --> 00:37:06.599 align:start position:0%
this law will be repealed effective July
 
00:37:09.170 --> 00:37:09.180 align:start position:0%
1 2023
 
00:37:11.930 --> 00:37:11.940 align:start position:0%
but calls on the State Education Agency
 
00:37:14.329 --> 00:37:14.339 align:start position:0%
to report to the legislature no later
 
00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
than January 15 on the impact and status
 
00:37:20.450 --> 00:37:20.460 align:start position:0%
of implementation of the law with
 
00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
various participation data and
 
00:37:25.310 --> 00:37:25.320 align:start position:0%
strategies for minimizing the use of
 
00:37:28.250 --> 00:37:28.260 align:start position:0%
State funds that's what I I'm very
 
00:37:30.890 --> 00:37:30.900 align:start position:0%
interested in that it also calls on the
 
00:37:34.130 --> 00:37:34.140 align:start position:0%
joint fiscal office to report on
 
00:37:37.130 --> 00:37:37.140 align:start position:0%
possible Revenue sources including and
 
00:37:39.290 --> 00:37:39.300 align:start position:0%
here comes the death of it the expansion
 
00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:40.130 align:start position:0%
here comes the death of it the expansion
of

00:37:40.130 --> 00:37:40.140 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:37:44.750 --> 00:37:44.760 align:start position:0%
sales tax the enactment of an excise tax
 
00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
on sugar sweetened Beverages and other
 
00:37:50.990 --> 00:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
sources of revenue not ordinarily used
 
00:37:54.589 --> 00:37:54.599 align:start position:0%
for general fund purposes so at least in
 
00:37:57.290 --> 00:37:57.300 align:start position:0%
the state of Vermont
 
00:38:00.290 --> 00:38:00.300 align:start position:0%
it looks like they are
 
00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:00.890 align:start position:0%
it looks like they are
um

00:38:00.890 --> 00:38:00.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:04.069 --> 00:38:04.079 align:start position:0%
looking at either instituting a new tax
 
00:38:10.250 --> 00:38:10.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:14.690 --> 00:38:14.700 align:start position:0%
doing something to the sales tax base
 
00:38:16.670 --> 00:38:16.680 align:start position:0%
yes sir
 
00:38:18.890 --> 00:38:18.900 align:start position:0%
and I know this has been recorded So I I
 
00:38:22.310 --> 00:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
ask you to read uh
 
00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:24.720 align:start position:0%
um repeat or present the last paragraph
 
00:38:26.750 --> 00:38:26.760 align:start position:0%
of this from one piece I find that
 
00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:28.310 align:start position:0%
of this from one piece I find that
critical

00:38:28.310 --> 00:38:28.320 align:start position:0%
critical
 
00:38:30.710 --> 00:38:30.720 align:start position:0%
the one that starts despite the
 
00:38:32.870 --> 00:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
perspective repeal okay thank you
 
00:38:36.050 --> 00:38:36.060 align:start position:0%
despite the perspective repeal the law
 
00:38:39.230 --> 00:38:39.240 align:start position:0%
includes a section declaring the
 
00:38:42.490 --> 00:38:42.500 align:start position:0%
legislature's intent to use information
 
00:38:45.349 --> 00:38:45.359 align:start position:0%
collected to identify the revenue
 
00:38:48.530 --> 00:38:48.540 align:start position:0%
amounts and sources necessary to
 
00:38:50.990 --> 00:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
establish long-term funding for
 
00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
Universal School meals
 
00:38:55.609 --> 00:38:55.619 align:start position:0%
so they're the review is not a diminish
 
00:38:57.349 --> 00:38:57.359 align:start position:0%
of the program it's just saying let's
 
00:38:59.569 --> 00:38:59.579 align:start position:0%
find it by the way right okay and I do
 
00:39:00.890 --> 00:39:00.900 align:start position:0%
have a follow-up to that yes sir you
 
00:39:02.990 --> 00:39:03.000 align:start position:0%
know or if there's an attorney if you
 
00:39:05.990 --> 00:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
want to know if if Vermont is a annual
 
00:39:07.730 --> 00:39:07.740 align:start position:0%
budget or biennial budget Brickman
 
00:39:10.609 --> 00:39:10.619 align:start position:0%
always lives over there okay is it may I
 
00:39:13.730 --> 00:39:13.740 align:start position:0%
ask sure is the Vermont budget annual
 
00:39:16.990 --> 00:39:17.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:28.569 --> 00:39:28.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:30.720 align:start position:0%
okay so they're looking at where they
 
00:39:32.510 --> 00:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
were appealing it and bring it back in
 
00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:34.560 align:start position:0%
the same calendar year I'm thinking it
 
00:39:35.930 --> 00:39:35.940 align:start position:0%
was the annual budget we're in New
 
00:39:37.069 --> 00:39:37.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we couldn't do that because it
 
00:39:39.770 --> 00:39:39.780 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be because it's by anyway yeah
 
00:39:43.010 --> 00:39:43.020 align:start position:0%
I mean obviously the I think the intent
 
00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
I think the intent of the statement
 
00:39:50.390 --> 00:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
the last thing is to yeah is to indicate
 
00:39:54.470 --> 00:39:54.480 align:start position:0%
that even if the law is repealed
 
00:39:56.870 --> 00:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
that they would be they'll be using the
 
00:39:59.950 --> 00:39:59.960 align:start position:0%
feeding information to
 
00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
find another Revenue Source if they have
 
00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
to to yeah to keep it going thank you
 
00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
thank you very much here
 
00:40:11.390 --> 00:40:11.400 align:start position:0%
what's the student population in Vermont
 
00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:14.050 align:start position:0%
do you have any ideas
 
00:40:14.050 --> 00:40:14.510 align:start position:0%
do you have any ideas
[Music]

00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:14.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:15.430 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

00:40:15.430 --> 00:40:15.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:18.290 --> 00:40:18.300 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at the cost of this program
 
00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
being 29 million dollars
 
00:40:23.089 --> 00:40:23.099 align:start position:0%
but I've always been on the impression
 
00:40:27.170 --> 00:40:27.180 align:start position:0%
that it's almost half what we have
 
00:40:30.170 --> 00:40:30.180 align:start position:0%
well I can tell you based on 20 whoops
 
00:40:33.410 --> 00:40:33.420 align:start position:0%
2018 and 2019 our numbers
 
00:40:38.510 --> 00:40:38.520 align:start position:0%
it's estimated uh that if we based on
 
00:40:41.329 --> 00:40:41.339 align:start position:0%
the 1819 numbers which are the last ones
 
00:40:45.470 --> 00:40:45.480 align:start position:0%
that were pre-covered it would cost us
 
00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:49.200 align:start position:0%
uh 24 million 696 thousand nine hundred
 
00:40:52.970 --> 00:40:52.980 align:start position:0%
and twelve dollars and 80 cents uh to
 
00:40:54.890 --> 00:40:54.900 align:start position:0%
feed everybody
 
00:40:57.170 --> 00:40:57.180 align:start position:0%
after Federal after the federal
 
00:41:00.050 --> 00:41:00.060 align:start position:0%
reimbursement those are the eligible yep
 
00:41:02.950 --> 00:41:02.960 align:start position:0%
prayer reduced no this is everybody
 
00:41:08.089 --> 00:41:08.099 align:start position:0%
that's 164 000 kids everybody yep
 
00:41:08.099 --> 00:41:10.250 align:start position:0%
that's 164 000 kids everybody yep
and

00:41:10.250 --> 00:41:10.260 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:41:13.970 --> 00:41:13.980 align:start position:0%
Vermont has two our kids than we do
 
00:41:16.490 --> 00:41:16.500 align:start position:0%
and yet ours is coming out at less costs
 
00:41:18.349 --> 00:41:18.359 align:start position:0%
that mean we have
 
00:41:22.430 --> 00:41:22.440 align:start position:0%
a lower poverty rate committed or we we
 
00:41:25.250 --> 00:41:25.260 align:start position:0%
might have a lower participation rate in
 
00:41:26.990 --> 00:41:27.000 align:start position:0%
the school meals program you know it's
 
00:41:30.650 --> 00:41:30.660 align:start position:0%
based on the number of meals served
 
00:41:33.589 --> 00:41:33.599 align:start position:0%
feeding everybody over there
 
00:41:36.829 --> 00:41:36.839 align:start position:0%
yeah if they're feeding everybody
 
00:41:39.530 --> 00:41:39.540 align:start position:0%
then we may have a higher participation
 
00:41:42.170 --> 00:41:42.180 align:start position:0%
rate we may have a lower number because
 
00:41:43.970 --> 00:41:43.980 align:start position:0%
we're getting more money back from the
 
00:41:45.589 --> 00:41:45.599 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
00:41:47.930 --> 00:41:47.940 align:start position:0%
but if we got less money back it would
 
00:41:50.690 --> 00:41:50.700 align:start position:0%
cost us even more
 
00:41:52.730 --> 00:41:52.740 align:start position:0%
because we just can't guess that we
 
00:41:55.550 --> 00:41:55.560 align:start position:0%
don't know yeah right right I mean we
 
00:41:57.410 --> 00:41:57.420 align:start position:0%
have to base numbers on something and
 
00:41:58.970 --> 00:41:58.980 align:start position:0%
what we're basing it on are the total
 
00:41:58.980 --> 00:42:00.050 align:start position:0%
what we're basing it on are the total
meals

00:42:00.050 --> 00:42:00.060 align:start position:0%
meals
 
00:42:03.470 --> 00:42:03.480 align:start position:0%
that were Freedom reduced the
 
00:42:05.690 --> 00:42:05.700 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rate on breakfast and
 
00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
lunch frame reduced and then the regular
 
00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
the number of regular meals served six
 
00:42:17.150 --> 00:42:17.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:20.510 --> 00:42:20.520 align:start position:0%
but this comes from uh
 
00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
the doe so if you have questions then
 
00:42:26.810 --> 00:42:26.820 align:start position:0%
I would say take advantage uh
 
00:42:32.290 --> 00:42:32.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:45.650 --> 00:42:45.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
I know okay Kelly Rambo from the
 
00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Education
 
00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
um so the document that
 
00:42:55.250 --> 00:42:55.260 align:start position:0%
um representative Mullen is speaking
 
00:42:55.260 --> 00:42:56.329 align:start position:0%
um representative Mullen is speaking
about

00:42:56.329 --> 00:42:56.339 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:42:59.030 --> 00:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
um she's in fact correct in um
 
00:43:02.270 --> 00:43:02.280 align:start position:0%
describing it so the way that it is
 
00:43:05.630 --> 00:43:05.640 align:start position:0%
written out is the
 
00:43:09.530 --> 00:43:09.540 align:start position:0%
difference between the
 
00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
um what the federal reimbursement what
 
00:43:13.849 --> 00:43:13.859 align:start position:0%
they would pay and then the state would
 
00:43:16.010 --> 00:43:16.020 align:start position:0%
pick up the difference as far as that's
 
00:43:17.870 --> 00:43:17.880 align:start position:0%
concerned so
 
00:43:20.030 --> 00:43:20.040 align:start position:0%
um also
 
00:43:22.010 --> 00:43:22.020 align:start position:0%
um representative Woodcock is also
 
00:43:22.020 --> 00:43:23.329 align:start position:0%
um representative Woodcock is also
correct

00:43:23.329 --> 00:43:23.339 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:43:26.089 --> 00:43:26.099 align:start position:0%
um in stating that it is very hard to
 
00:43:28.130 --> 00:43:28.140 align:start position:0%
figure out the exact number that this
 
00:43:31.010 --> 00:43:31.020 align:start position:0%
would be due to the fact that we are
 
00:43:33.230 --> 00:43:33.240 align:start position:0%
basing the numbers um in front of you
 
00:43:37.010 --> 00:43:37.020 align:start position:0%
off of meals that are served so if you
 
00:43:40.430 --> 00:43:40.440 align:start position:0%
were to want a different number on every
 
00:43:42.650 --> 00:43:42.660 align:start position:0%
single student that was in the state of
 
00:43:43.630 --> 00:43:43.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:43:47.210 --> 00:43:47.220 align:start position:0%
that could possibly get a meal that
 
00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:48.720 align:start position:0%
would be a different number than the
 
00:43:50.030 --> 00:43:50.040 align:start position:0%
number that's in front of you so the
 
00:43:51.829 --> 00:43:51.839 align:start position:0%
number that's in front of you is actual
 
00:43:55.430 --> 00:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
meals that were served in all of the
 
00:43:58.250 --> 00:43:58.260 align:start position:0%
Child Nutrition national school lunch
 
00:44:01.790 --> 00:44:01.800 align:start position:0%
program meals for 1819 but if you're
 
00:44:03.890 --> 00:44:03.900 align:start position:0%
wanting a different number that's
 
00:44:06.290 --> 00:44:06.300 align:start position:0%
something that I can get you um as well
 
00:44:08.710 --> 00:44:08.720 align:start position:0%
it might be a shocking amount
 
00:44:11.809 --> 00:44:11.819 align:start position:0%
to see that the difference between those
 
00:44:13.130 --> 00:44:13.140 align:start position:0%
two but if it's something that you're
 
00:44:17.390 --> 00:44:17.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:19.910 --> 00:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
representative Ellison uh following
 
00:44:22.130 --> 00:44:22.140 align:start position:0%
along with that then and trying to get
 
00:44:27.230 --> 00:44:27.240 align:start position:0%
to the shocking number uh we would if if
 
00:44:29.990 --> 00:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
the participation rate it free reduced
 
00:44:32.750 --> 00:44:32.760 align:start position:0%
prices fit 40 percent or whatever it is
 
00:44:34.390 --> 00:44:34.400 align:start position:0%
52 percent
 
00:44:37.069 --> 00:44:37.079 align:start position:0%
you're you're saying if we push it to a
 
00:44:38.809 --> 00:44:38.819 align:start position:0%
hundred percent there would be a new
 
00:44:41.329 --> 00:44:41.339 align:start position:0%
figure is that what you're saying
 
00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
um yes and no
 
00:44:45.530 --> 00:44:45.540 align:start position:0%
um so the the number that's in front of
 
00:44:48.349 --> 00:44:48.359 align:start position:0%
you is based off of the meals that were
 
00:44:50.089 --> 00:44:50.099 align:start position:0%
served for free the meals that were
 
00:44:51.890 --> 00:44:51.900 align:start position:0%
served for reducing the meals that were
 
00:44:53.690 --> 00:44:53.700 align:start position:0%
served for paid
 
00:44:55.849 --> 00:44:55.859 align:start position:0%
um something to consider and think about
 
00:44:57.710 --> 00:44:57.720 align:start position:0%
in the states that we're speaking about
 
00:44:59.569 --> 00:44:59.579 align:start position:0%
and how they're running their programs
 
00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
they still need to collect in order to
 
00:45:04.550 --> 00:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
get Federal reimbursement they still
 
00:45:06.410 --> 00:45:06.420 align:start position:0%
need to collect the application so they
 
00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
still need to determine those students
 
00:45:10.069 --> 00:45:10.079 align:start position:0%
free reduced or paid
 
00:45:12.890 --> 00:45:12.900 align:start position:0%
um so depending on the outcome of that
 
00:45:14.690 --> 00:45:14.700 align:start position:0%
that's going to be what's going to
 
00:45:17.990 --> 00:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
change your federal reimbursement and
 
00:45:20.450 --> 00:45:20.460 align:start position:0%
that would in fact then change the state
 
00:45:23.390 --> 00:45:23.400 align:start position:0%
let's call it State match or state state
 
00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:24.550 align:start position:0%
let's call it State match or state state
funding

00:45:24.550 --> 00:45:24.560 align:start position:0%
funding
 
00:45:28.870 --> 00:45:28.880 align:start position:0%
follow-up I'm sure yes then then I guess
 
00:45:32.089 --> 00:45:32.099 align:start position:0%
I I don't want to do a lot a lot more
 
00:45:34.910 --> 00:45:34.920 align:start position:0%
calculations but if a hundred percent of
 
00:45:37.730 --> 00:45:37.740 align:start position:0%
this student families students in the
 
00:45:40.430 --> 00:45:40.440 align:start position:0%
state who are who are eligible for free
 
00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
reduced price launch or fed regardless
 
00:45:45.410 --> 00:45:45.420 align:start position:0%
of whether they put an application or
 
00:45:47.569 --> 00:45:47.579 align:start position:0%
not what would that I'm interested in
 
00:45:49.069 --> 00:45:49.079 align:start position:0%
that figure
 
00:45:51.050 --> 00:45:51.060 align:start position:0%
and I can I can get that for you that
 
00:45:52.790 --> 00:45:52.800 align:start position:0%
would be great thank you
 
00:45:55.069 --> 00:45:55.079 align:start position:0%
representative flickas
 
00:45:56.690 --> 00:45:56.700 align:start position:0%
just trying to figure out the number
 
00:46:00.290 --> 00:46:00.300 align:start position:0%
that you have so you looked at
 
00:46:03.470 --> 00:46:03.480 align:start position:0%
my right the not just the free and
 
00:46:06.829 --> 00:46:06.839 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch but all kids who bought
 
00:46:10.190 --> 00:46:10.200 align:start position:0%
lunch from the school as in that would
 
00:46:13.309 --> 00:46:13.319 align:start position:0%
be the meal served that's correct and
 
00:46:14.750 --> 00:46:14.760 align:start position:0%
the rest would have brought their lunch
 
00:46:18.410 --> 00:46:18.420 align:start position:0%
or whatever that's correct and so
 
00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:20.640 align:start position:0%
if we were to say well let's feed
 
00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:21.890 align:start position:0%
if we were to say well let's feed
everybody

00:46:21.890 --> 00:46:21.900 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
00:46:24.410 --> 00:46:24.420 align:start position:0%
that number may change because kids who
 
00:46:27.290 --> 00:46:27.300 align:start position:0%
bring their lunch if it's free might
 
00:46:29.150 --> 00:46:29.160 align:start position:0%
take the free lunch
 
00:46:31.670 --> 00:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
and so we would have to make a new
 
00:46:34.609 --> 00:46:34.619 align:start position:0%
estimation that's correct
 
00:46:37.490 --> 00:46:37.500 align:start position:0%
um and so the way that the program has
 
00:46:40.130 --> 00:46:40.140 align:start position:0%
run in the past for the past two years
 
00:46:42.890 --> 00:46:42.900 align:start position:0%
due to covid was
 
00:46:46.130 --> 00:46:46.140 align:start position:0%
there was no eligibility determination
 
00:46:48.430 --> 00:46:48.440 align:start position:0%
needed for that so that's why everybody
 
00:46:52.130 --> 00:46:52.140 align:start position:0%
received a free lunch then in turn for
 
00:46:54.890 --> 00:46:54.900 align:start position:0%
those meals every school received the
 
00:46:58.250 --> 00:46:58.260 align:start position:0%
free Federal reimbursement rate but now
 
00:47:01.490 --> 00:47:01.500 align:start position:0%
that we are shifting back into the mslp
 
00:47:03.250 --> 00:47:03.260 align:start position:0%
national school lunch program
 
00:47:05.210 --> 00:47:05.220 align:start position:0%
reimbursement that's when you're going
 
00:47:07.609 --> 00:47:07.619 align:start position:0%
to see the free reduced and and the paid
 
00:47:08.870 --> 00:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
reimbursements from the federal
 
00:47:11.630 --> 00:47:11.640 align:start position:0%
government so would we be able to get an
 
00:47:15.829 --> 00:47:15.839 align:start position:0%
estimate based on the last two years
 
00:47:19.550 --> 00:47:19.560 align:start position:0%
of what the basic cost per student
 
00:47:22.609 --> 00:47:22.619 align:start position:0%
getting lunch is and then apply that to
 
00:47:24.950 --> 00:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
the earlier ones when we had more kids
 
00:47:26.450 --> 00:47:26.460 align:start position:0%
in school
 
00:47:26.460 --> 00:47:28.069 align:start position:0%
in school
so

00:47:28.069 --> 00:47:28.079 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:47:29.030 --> 00:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
um I just want to make sure I understand
 
00:47:30.950 --> 00:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
so I get you the correct information so
 
00:47:34.370 --> 00:47:34.380 align:start position:0%
you want the what the free reimbursement
 
00:47:37.069 --> 00:47:37.079 align:start position:0%
was for last year
 
00:47:38.990 --> 00:47:39.000 align:start position:0%
the free reimbursement rate from the
 
00:47:41.809 --> 00:47:41.819 align:start position:0%
federal government and apply that to
 
00:47:43.490 --> 00:47:43.500 align:start position:0%
um the 1819
 
00:47:46.670 --> 00:47:46.680 align:start position:0%
yeah basically what did it cost us when
 
00:47:49.910 --> 00:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
we were feeding everybody for free
 
00:47:52.550 --> 00:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
what was the actual cost I mean yes I
 
00:47:53.870 --> 00:47:53.880 align:start position:0%
know we got money back from the
 
00:47:55.550 --> 00:47:55.560 align:start position:0%
government but what did it actually cost
 
00:47:59.150 --> 00:47:59.160 align:start position:0%
us to provide that per pupil and then
 
00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
multiply that by the
 
00:48:04.250 --> 00:48:04.260 align:start position:0%
numbers from the sem 1819 because those
 
00:48:06.650 --> 00:48:06.660 align:start position:0%
are more like the number of pupils we
 
00:48:06.660 --> 00:48:07.550 align:start position:0%
are more like the number of pupils we
have

00:48:07.550 --> 00:48:07.560 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:48:09.530 --> 00:48:09.540 align:start position:0%
okay it makes sense I can get you that
 
00:48:11.270 --> 00:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
number so
 
00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:12.650 align:start position:0%
number so
um

00:48:12.650 --> 00:48:12.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:15.829 --> 00:48:15.839 align:start position:0%
it would be for for me to get you that
 
00:48:17.809 --> 00:48:17.819 align:start position:0%
number for
 
00:48:17.819 --> 00:48:18.550 align:start position:0%
number for
um

00:48:18.550 --> 00:48:18.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:23.829 --> 00:48:23.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:26.510 --> 00:48:26.520 align:start position:0%
two years ago maybe
 
00:48:30.290 --> 00:48:30.300 align:start position:0%
two oh no they weren't in the building
 
00:48:31.970 --> 00:48:31.980 align:start position:0%
oh so it's going to be completely
 
00:48:34.609 --> 00:48:34.619 align:start position:0%
different never mind I'm just trying to
 
00:48:36.950 --> 00:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
figure out but we know meals served so
 
00:48:40.130 --> 00:48:40.140 align:start position:0%
we can figure out per pupil cost and
 
00:48:42.589 --> 00:48:42.599 align:start position:0%
multiply that if everybody decided to
 
00:48:44.510 --> 00:48:44.520 align:start position:0%
eat a free meal as opposed to bringing
 
00:48:46.250 --> 00:48:46.260 align:start position:0%
their lunch
 
00:48:50.210 --> 00:48:50.220 align:start position:0%
so we have um how many meals were served
 
00:48:51.589 --> 00:48:51.599 align:start position:0%
for last year
 
00:48:54.050 --> 00:48:54.060 align:start position:0%
um and the way that it's in our system
 
00:48:56.270 --> 00:48:56.280 align:start position:0%
um they're all it's free
 
00:48:58.790 --> 00:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
breakfast and free lunch we don't have
 
00:49:01.190 --> 00:49:01.200 align:start position:0%
it separate out in free reducing paid
 
00:49:02.809 --> 00:49:02.819 align:start position:0%
because of the way that the claims were
 
00:49:04.430 --> 00:49:04.440 align:start position:0%
paid out for last year for the federal
 
00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:06.290 align:start position:0%
paid out for last year for the federal
reimbursement

00:49:06.290 --> 00:49:06.300 align:start position:0%
reimbursement
 
00:49:09.109 --> 00:49:09.119 align:start position:0%
um so I can take the total amount of
 
00:49:12.410 --> 00:49:12.420 align:start position:0%
breakfast that was served last year
 
00:49:15.470 --> 00:49:15.480 align:start position:0%
um I believe I might have worked
 
00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:16.069 align:start position:0%
um I believe I might have worked
um

00:49:16.069 --> 00:49:16.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:18.710 --> 00:49:18.720 align:start position:0%
Jen with you on that
 
00:49:21.829 --> 00:49:21.839 align:start position:0%
um so I will I'll reconfigure that and
 
00:49:24.109 --> 00:49:24.119 align:start position:0%
and get those numbers for you
 
00:49:25.430 --> 00:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
um and if it's not what you're looking
 
00:49:28.069 --> 00:49:28.079 align:start position:0%
for then I'll try and try my best to get
 
00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
you what you are looking just just
 
00:49:31.490 --> 00:49:31.500 align:start position:0%
trying to get an idea of what if
 
00:49:33.170 --> 00:49:33.180 align:start position:0%
everybody ate lunch what would it really
 
00:49:36.109 --> 00:49:36.119 align:start position:0%
cost yes yeah and I can tell you that in
 
00:49:38.750 --> 00:49:38.760 align:start position:0%
in federal reimbursement
 
00:49:41.089 --> 00:49:41.099 align:start position:0%
um we have pushed out over a hundred
 
00:49:44.930 --> 00:49:44.940 align:start position:0%
million dollars out of our office for
 
00:49:47.630 --> 00:49:47.640 align:start position:0%
last year alone thank you
 
00:49:51.650 --> 00:49:51.660 align:start position:0%
okay yeah I'd be interested in
 
00:49:55.250 --> 00:49:55.260 align:start position:0%
I mean I know that we have
 
00:49:59.770 --> 00:49:59.780 align:start position:0%
well I we have not tallied but the
 
00:50:04.670 --> 00:50:04.680 align:start position:0%
455 000 free breakfast the 65 000 what
 
00:50:07.010 --> 00:50:07.020 align:start position:0%
What's the total number of meals served
 
00:50:10.609 --> 00:50:10.619 align:start position:0%
in 1819 and then the total number of
 
00:50:13.910 --> 00:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
meals served last year
 
00:50:16.970 --> 00:50:16.980 align:start position:0%
just as a comparison in numbers because
 
00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:18.650 align:start position:0%
just as a comparison in numbers because
I

00:50:18.650 --> 00:50:18.660 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:50:18.660 --> 00:50:19.370 align:start position:0%
I
um

00:50:19.370 --> 00:50:19.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:22.609 --> 00:50:22.619 align:start position:0%
did cafeteria Duty for 39 years of my
 
00:50:22.619 --> 00:50:23.630 align:start position:0%
did cafeteria Duty for 39 years of my
life

00:50:23.630 --> 00:50:23.640 align:start position:0%
life
 
00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:28.140 align:start position:0%
and I believe that even if the food was
 
00:50:30.770 --> 00:50:30.780 align:start position:0%
free there would be some kids that would
 
00:50:33.730 --> 00:50:33.740 align:start position:0%
brown bag it because they just
 
00:50:36.890 --> 00:50:36.900 align:start position:0%
yeah in fact members of this committee
 
00:50:40.430 --> 00:50:40.440 align:start position:0%
have taken great joy in teasing me for
 
00:50:43.069 --> 00:50:43.079 align:start position:0%
being a brown bagger for the past four
 
00:50:46.069 --> 00:50:46.079 align:start position:0%
years and not
 
00:50:49.309 --> 00:50:49.319 align:start position:0%
availing myself of the opportunity of uh
 
00:50:50.990 --> 00:50:51.000 align:start position:0%
cafeteria dining
 
00:50:54.349 --> 00:50:54.359 align:start position:0%
so so I think that there would be you
 
00:50:56.089 --> 00:50:56.099 align:start position:0%
know that there would be kids that I
 
00:50:58.130 --> 00:50:58.140 align:start position:0%
don't I don't think it's a foregone
 
00:50:59.870 --> 00:50:59.880 align:start position:0%
conclusion that just because it's free
 
00:51:01.430 --> 00:51:01.440 align:start position:0%
they're going to eat it
 
00:51:03.589 --> 00:51:03.599 align:start position:0%
and so what I can do is I can provide
 
00:51:05.870 --> 00:51:05.880 align:start position:0%
the total meals for
 
00:51:05.880 --> 00:51:06.890 align:start position:0%
the total meals for
um

00:51:06.890 --> 00:51:06.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:09.950 --> 00:51:09.960 align:start position:0%
in its entirety for 1819 between
 
00:51:11.569 --> 00:51:11.579 align:start position:0%
breakfast and lunch I won't break it
 
00:51:13.849 --> 00:51:13.859 align:start position:0%
down for your reduced paid
 
00:51:16.609 --> 00:51:16.619 align:start position:0%
um and then um I will do the same for 21
 
00:51:20.690 --> 00:51:20.700 align:start position:0%
22 and then we can I'll give you what
 
00:51:22.490 --> 00:51:22.500 align:start position:0%
the federal reimbursement rate was for
 
00:51:25.250 --> 00:51:25.260 align:start position:0%
free and then we can figure out the
 
00:51:27.230 --> 00:51:27.240 align:start position:0%
equation from there to get the the total
 
00:51:28.549 --> 00:51:28.559 align:start position:0%
amount great
 
00:51:31.970 --> 00:51:31.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:34.370 --> 00:51:34.380 align:start position:0%
yes sir representative Woodcock yes
 
00:51:36.230 --> 00:51:36.240 align:start position:0%
thank you I don't know why
 
00:51:37.849 --> 00:51:37.859 align:start position:0%
representative Hall would do that do you
 
00:51:39.410 --> 00:51:39.420 align:start position:0%
keep on ridiculing you a bunch of brown
 
00:51:40.670 --> 00:51:40.680 align:start position:0%
bag but
 
00:51:43.250 --> 00:51:43.260 align:start position:0%
um just a question for uh Kenneth I may
 
00:51:45.849 --> 00:51:45.859 align:start position:0%
uh is the
 
00:51:48.770 --> 00:51:48.780 align:start position:0%
percentage rate of youngsters to
 
00:51:51.950 --> 00:51:51.960 align:start position:0%
participate across the board uh annually
 
00:51:54.589 --> 00:51:54.599 align:start position:0%
in our free reduced meals relatively
 
00:51:57.349 --> 00:51:57.359 align:start position:0%
similar every year or is there a big I
 
00:51:59.630 --> 00:51:59.640 align:start position:0%
mean is one year like 25 is in this 12
 
00:52:01.250 --> 00:52:01.260 align:start position:0%
or is it normally a certain number
 
00:52:03.710 --> 00:52:03.720 align:start position:0%
within a margin so every year so you
 
00:52:06.829 --> 00:52:06.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:06.839 --> 00:52:09.470 align:start position:0%
 
um I

00:52:09.470 --> 00:52:09.480 align:start position:0%
um I
 
00:52:11.150 --> 00:52:11.160 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to remember all the numbers
 
00:52:13.490 --> 00:52:13.500 align:start position:0%
that I had pulled um for the committee
 
00:52:14.990 --> 00:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
for last time
 
00:52:17.569 --> 00:52:17.579 align:start position:0%
um I would say it's within you know 10
 
00:52:17.579 --> 00:52:19.190 align:start position:0%
um I would say it's within you know 10
10

00:52:19.190 --> 00:52:19.200 align:start position:0%
10
 
00:52:21.770 --> 00:52:21.780 align:start position:0%
um up or down um give or take
 
00:52:25.250 --> 00:52:25.260 align:start position:0%
um and all of that information is
 
00:52:28.430 --> 00:52:28.440 align:start position:0%
um is on the the web
 
00:52:29.809 --> 00:52:29.819 align:start position:0%
um our web page
 
00:52:33.530 --> 00:52:33.540 align:start position:0%
um but as far in my capacity and my role
 
00:52:34.970 --> 00:52:34.980 align:start position:0%
just for this
 
00:52:37.010 --> 00:52:37.020 align:start position:0%
um I would say it's either
 
00:52:37.020 --> 00:52:38.270 align:start position:0%
um I would say it's either
10

00:52:38.270 --> 00:52:38.280 align:start position:0%
10
 
00:52:39.770 --> 00:52:39.780 align:start position:0%
um up or down
 
00:52:42.230 --> 00:52:42.240 align:start position:0%
um but I'm I just uh can I ask you
 
00:52:44.270 --> 00:52:44.280 align:start position:0%
clarifying real sure
 
00:52:46.990 --> 00:52:47.000 align:start position:0%
um just uh she likes you
 
00:52:50.690 --> 00:52:50.700 align:start position:0%
most definitely without hesitation thank
 
00:52:50.700 --> 00:52:51.770 align:start position:0%
most definitely without hesitation thank
you

00:52:51.770 --> 00:52:51.780 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:52:53.690 --> 00:52:53.700 align:start position:0%
um so I just want to make sure I
 
00:52:55.190 --> 00:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
understand your question correctly are
 
00:52:57.109 --> 00:52:57.119 align:start position:0%
you asking in in the entirety of the
 
00:52:59.150 --> 00:52:59.160 align:start position:0%
like let's say the United States or just
 
00:53:01.630 --> 00:53:01.640 align:start position:0%
for for our our state in and of itself
 
00:53:05.089 --> 00:53:05.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:09.349 --> 00:53:09.359 align:start position:0%
um yes I would say um give or take up um
 
00:53:11.329 --> 00:53:11.339 align:start position:0%
up or down 10
 
00:53:13.250 --> 00:53:13.260 align:start position:0%
um in that in that range yes for the
 
00:53:15.730 --> 00:53:15.740 align:start position:0%
data that we have okay
 
00:53:18.410 --> 00:53:18.420 align:start position:0%
yes sir is
 
00:53:23.870 --> 00:53:23.880 align:start position:0%
um does the federal uh rate change uh
 
00:53:26.210 --> 00:53:26.220 align:start position:0%
during the year once it said it stays
 
00:53:27.650 --> 00:53:27.660 align:start position:0%
that way I was thinking about the cost
 
00:53:31.190 --> 00:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
of food products across uh the country
 
00:53:33.710 --> 00:53:33.720 align:start position:0%
and internationally right now and the
 
00:53:35.809 --> 00:53:35.819 align:start position:0%
inflation now is international so is
 
00:53:37.790 --> 00:53:37.800 align:start position:0%
that the rate going to change will be
 
00:53:39.290 --> 00:53:39.300 align:start position:0%
adjusted once it's set annually they
 
00:53:41.270 --> 00:53:41.280 align:start position:0%
just set it and keep it regardless
 
00:53:43.670 --> 00:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
um it's set annually so
 
00:53:46.190 --> 00:53:46.200 align:start position:0%
um the reimbursement rates
 
00:53:48.589 --> 00:53:48.599 align:start position:0%
um normally I say
 
00:53:52.430 --> 00:53:52.440 align:start position:0%
um would come out in July or
 
00:53:54.890 --> 00:53:54.900 align:start position:0%
um maybe August they were pretty late
 
00:53:56.930 --> 00:53:56.940 align:start position:0%
this year for um and they came out in
 
00:53:59.510 --> 00:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
August but they normally the the rates
 
00:54:03.890 --> 00:54:03.900 align:start position:0%
run from July to um to June 30th so for
 
00:54:06.530 --> 00:54:06.540 align:start position:0%
this particular year the rate was a
 
00:54:09.049 --> 00:54:09.059 align:start position:0%
little bit higher than it normally was
 
00:54:11.630 --> 00:54:11.640 align:start position:0%
due to the the act that that was in
 
00:54:14.390 --> 00:54:14.400 align:start position:0%
place for that so that will stay the
 
00:54:16.490 --> 00:54:16.500 align:start position:0%
same until the end of this school year
 
00:54:17.990 --> 00:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
and then once a new school year begins
 
00:54:20.870 --> 00:54:20.880 align:start position:0%
new rates will come out okay
 
00:54:23.089 --> 00:54:23.099 align:start position:0%
um if I may I like to present just an
 
00:54:25.130 --> 00:54:25.140 align:start position:0%
anecdotal fact
 
00:54:27.109 --> 00:54:27.119 align:start position:0%
um in preparing for today's meeting I
 
00:54:29.930 --> 00:54:29.940 align:start position:0%
was speaking with the family liaison in
 
00:54:32.150 --> 00:54:32.160 align:start position:0%
one of the schools in our district uh
 
00:54:34.490 --> 00:54:34.500 align:start position:0%
back home and asked about what she saw
 
00:54:36.589 --> 00:54:36.599 align:start position:0%
for the difference if any with people in
 
00:54:38.329 --> 00:54:38.339 align:start position:0%
the brown bags and the those that don't
 
00:54:41.750 --> 00:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
yada yada and what she said was the most
 
00:54:44.630 --> 00:54:44.640 align:start position:0%
significant difference she saw that was
 
00:54:48.530 --> 00:54:48.540 align:start position:0%
youngsters who typically uh did not were
 
00:54:50.829 --> 00:54:50.839 align:start position:0%
not in that breakfast lunch category
 
00:54:53.930 --> 00:54:53.940 align:start position:0%
we're stopping to taking breakfasts to
 
00:54:56.210 --> 00:54:56.220 align:start position:0%
go she said they they come in all the
 
00:54:57.349 --> 00:54:57.359 align:start position:0%
time we wouldn't have had breakfast but
 
00:54:58.910 --> 00:54:58.920 align:start position:0%
they didn't care she said this is the
 
00:55:00.770 --> 00:55:00.780 align:start position:0%
biggest thing she saw when the federal
 
00:55:02.150 --> 00:55:02.160 align:start position:0%
government came to free to do this was
 
00:55:04.190 --> 00:55:04.200 align:start position:0%
the youngsters in the elementary school
 
00:55:06.589 --> 00:55:06.599 align:start position:0%
and there for elementary schools those
 
00:55:09.290 --> 00:55:09.300 align:start position:0%
kids would come down and eagerly take
 
00:55:12.049 --> 00:55:12.059 align:start position:0%
their lunch to go back in that period
 
00:55:14.329 --> 00:55:14.339 align:start position:0%
um that would just before never met any
 
00:55:16.069 --> 00:55:16.079 align:start position:0%
criteria and never had it she said
 
00:55:19.010 --> 00:55:19.020 align:start position:0%
that's the biggest difference she had so
 
00:55:21.290 --> 00:55:21.300 align:start position:0%
um is my last my last I hope last
 
00:55:24.049 --> 00:55:24.059 align:start position:0%
question yeah um if you were and I know
 
00:55:25.670 --> 00:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
we spoke about this earlier and
 
00:55:27.770 --> 00:55:27.780 align:start position:0%
representative Ellison followed me up
 
00:55:30.230 --> 00:55:30.240 align:start position:0%
and understanding it again if there was
 
00:55:32.809 --> 00:55:32.819 align:start position:0%
a number if we took the number that
 
00:55:35.030 --> 00:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
representative Ladd said 164 000 I think
 
00:55:36.950 --> 00:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
was the number of Youth of youngsters in
 
00:55:39.109 --> 00:55:39.119 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire his school is that Brooke
 
00:55:41.750 --> 00:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
is that right 164. that's around it okay
 
00:55:44.750 --> 00:55:44.760 align:start position:0%
so we took that number of 164 youngsters
 
00:55:47.930 --> 00:55:47.940 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire uh and we have to K-12
 
00:55:50.569 --> 00:55:50.579 align:start position:0%
schools right now uh and assume that all
 
00:55:54.170 --> 00:55:54.180 align:start position:0%
qualify and the federal system of uh
 
00:55:56.210 --> 00:55:56.220 align:start position:0%
Alicia talked about signing up or the
 
00:55:58.250 --> 00:55:58.260 align:start position:0%
Medicaid production that all the options
 
00:56:00.349 --> 00:56:00.359 align:start position:0%
looking in fact we sign up
 
00:56:03.190 --> 00:56:03.200 align:start position:0%
is there a can you give us a guesstimate
 
00:56:07.130 --> 00:56:07.140 align:start position:0%
uh what two figures what the cost might
 
00:56:10.210 --> 00:56:10.220 align:start position:0%
be for the program
 
00:56:15.710 --> 00:56:15.720 align:start position:0%
uh for all 164 and what particularly uh
 
00:56:18.290 --> 00:56:18.300 align:start position:0%
what the guesstimation may be in your
 
00:56:20.210 --> 00:56:20.220 align:start position:0%
best you know now
 
00:56:21.950 --> 00:56:21.960 align:start position:0%
um for what it might cost for the State
 
00:56:23.930 --> 00:56:23.940 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire assuming all the
 
00:56:25.309 --> 00:56:25.319 align:start position:0%
federal reimbursement fees that come to
 
00:56:27.049 --> 00:56:27.059 align:start position:0%
your office would came in like they
 
00:56:27.059 --> 00:56:28.190 align:start position:0%
your office would came in like they
should

00:56:28.190 --> 00:56:28.200 align:start position:0%
should
 
00:56:29.750 --> 00:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
um what would it what would it cost what
 
00:56:30.829 --> 00:56:30.839 align:start position:0%
were we looking at for a number of
 
00:56:33.470 --> 00:56:33.480 align:start position:0%
defeat to do a two of them on to do or
 
00:56:34.910 --> 00:56:34.920 align:start position:0%
you know to feed all the youngsters
 
00:56:36.470 --> 00:56:36.480 align:start position:0%
every youngster that comes through that
 
00:56:37.910 --> 00:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
they make sure they have healthy meals
 
00:56:39.770 --> 00:56:39.780 align:start position:0%
to start the day and and be fed at least
 
00:56:41.630 --> 00:56:41.640 align:start position:0%
two days two meals a day what would that
 
00:56:44.329 --> 00:56:44.339 align:start position:0%
cost to stay in New Hampshire
 
00:56:46.130 --> 00:56:46.140 align:start position:0%
you may not have a secret of your tongue
 
00:56:48.290 --> 00:56:48.300 align:start position:0%
I mean I am not a mathematician that is
 
00:56:49.430 --> 00:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
for sure
 
00:56:51.650 --> 00:56:51.660 align:start position:0%
um so that's a critical figure
 
00:56:51.660 --> 00:56:52.490 align:start position:0%
um so that's a critical figure
um

00:56:52.490 --> 00:56:52.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:54.470 --> 00:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
if you go off by five cents we'll be
 
00:56:54.480 --> 00:56:56.569 align:start position:0%
if you go off by five cents we'll be
aggravated

00:56:56.569 --> 00:56:56.579 align:start position:0%
aggravated
 
00:56:57.950 --> 00:56:57.960 align:start position:0%
um so I will have to get that cost for
 
00:56:57.960 --> 00:56:58.849 align:start position:0%
um so I will have to get that cost for
you

00:56:58.849 --> 00:56:58.859 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:57:01.370 --> 00:57:01.380 align:start position:0%
um but I just wanted to
 
00:57:04.370 --> 00:57:04.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:06.829 --> 00:57:06.839 align:start position:0%
it's very difficult to get that number
 
00:57:10.190 --> 00:57:10.200 align:start position:0%
without having the free and reduced
 
00:57:13.130 --> 00:57:13.140 align:start position:0%
information because that's the point of
 
00:57:15.349 --> 00:57:15.359 align:start position:0%
how we're going to get that figure that
 
00:57:18.410 --> 00:57:18.420 align:start position:0%
the state is going to need to pay for
 
00:57:21.290 --> 00:57:21.300 align:start position:0%
um and to make up that difference so we
 
00:57:23.990 --> 00:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
need to have what the federal government
 
00:57:27.530 --> 00:57:27.540 align:start position:0%
is going to be providing so that
 
00:57:29.210 --> 00:57:29.220 align:start position:0%
um I mean I could definitely give you a
 
00:57:30.890 --> 00:57:30.900 align:start position:0%
number if
 
00:57:34.430 --> 00:57:34.440 align:start position:0%
um you told me that there was a 164
 
00:57:37.130 --> 00:57:37.140 align:start position:0%
000 that were reduced we can you know we
 
00:57:38.990 --> 00:57:39.000 align:start position:0%
can get you that number if they're the
 
00:57:40.309 --> 00:57:40.319 align:start position:0%
federal reimbursement was going to be
 
00:57:41.809 --> 00:57:41.819 align:start position:0%
the reduced rate I could do the
 
00:57:43.250 --> 00:57:43.260 align:start position:0%
difference between and I could get you
 
00:57:44.750 --> 00:57:44.760 align:start position:0%
that number
 
00:57:47.809 --> 00:57:47.819 align:start position:0%
um if they were all free then the
 
00:57:48.829 --> 00:57:48.839 align:start position:0%
federal government would pay for them
 
00:57:50.930 --> 00:57:50.940 align:start position:0%
all and would cost you nothing
 
00:57:54.410 --> 00:57:54.420 align:start position:0%
um so we need to have some sort of data
 
00:57:57.349 --> 00:57:57.359 align:start position:0%
to be able to kind of plug in and play
 
00:58:00.589 --> 00:58:00.599 align:start position:0%
so to speak to get a figure for um for
 
00:58:02.829 --> 00:58:02.839 align:start position:0%
what you're asking
 
00:58:06.170 --> 00:58:06.180 align:start position:0%
yes sir thank you I only asked that I'm
 
00:58:07.970 --> 00:58:07.980 align:start position:0%
not trying to be pursue this any further
 
00:58:09.349 --> 00:58:09.359 align:start position:0%
than the committee may want to know what
 
00:58:11.450 --> 00:58:11.460 align:start position:0%
they're going to vote but if in fact
 
00:58:13.250 --> 00:58:13.260 align:start position:0%
anything comes out in legislative
 
00:58:15.470 --> 00:58:15.480 align:start position:0%
requests next year there's going to be
 
00:58:18.530 --> 00:58:18.540 align:start position:0%
that FN number next to it so somewhere
 
00:58:21.710 --> 00:58:21.720 align:start position:0%
between January and the start of session
 
00:58:22.910 --> 00:58:22.920 align:start position:0%
if there's any legislative that comes
 
00:58:25.069 --> 00:58:25.079 align:start position:0%
here that that number is going to have
 
00:58:27.290 --> 00:58:27.300 align:start position:0%
to be calculated somehow
 
00:58:28.849 --> 00:58:28.859 align:start position:0%
because there will be a cost that
 
00:58:30.589 --> 00:58:30.599 align:start position:0%
someone's gonna have to look at with an
 
00:58:33.049 --> 00:58:33.059 align:start position:0%
ethnic number of legislation so I'm just
 
00:58:36.829 --> 00:58:36.839 align:start position:0%
saying that no and um and I understand
 
00:58:40.010 --> 00:58:40.020 align:start position:0%
what you're saying I just it's hard to
 
00:58:42.950 --> 00:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
get the number without having
 
00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:43.549 align:start position:0%
get the number without having
um

00:58:43.549 --> 00:58:43.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:47.150 --> 00:58:47.160 align:start position:0%
the free and reduced information to
 
00:58:50.390 --> 00:58:50.400 align:start position:0%
offset the federal government cost yeah
 
00:58:53.150 --> 00:58:53.160 align:start position:0%
one more Yep is October is October 31
 
00:58:55.370 --> 00:58:55.380 align:start position:0%
the the deadline for for participation
 
00:58:57.109 --> 00:58:57.119 align:start position:0%
that or September when the kids come to
 
00:58:57.119 --> 00:58:58.250 align:start position:0%
that or September when the kids come to
school

00:58:58.250 --> 00:58:58.260 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:59:01.010 --> 00:59:01.020 align:start position:0%
fix this year right now today
 
00:59:04.130 --> 00:59:04.140 align:start position:0%
um for the the Department of Education
 
00:59:08.329 --> 00:59:08.339 align:start position:0%
it we collect that data in October
 
00:59:10.190 --> 00:59:10.200 align:start position:0%
um they can apply for free and reduce at
 
00:59:13.010 --> 00:59:13.020 align:start position:0%
any point in time during the school year
 
00:59:15.349 --> 00:59:15.359 align:start position:0%
um so there's no deadline for them to to
 
00:59:18.049 --> 00:59:18.059 align:start position:0%
apply for it but we we do data point
 
00:59:20.750 --> 00:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
collection yes October 31 is the end of
 
00:59:24.049 --> 00:59:24.059 align:start position:0%
the data point collection yes so so for
 
00:59:25.490 --> 00:59:25.500 align:start position:0%
the projection we're talking about
 
00:59:27.049 --> 00:59:27.059 align:start position:0%
somewhere after say November
 
00:59:29.690 --> 00:59:29.700 align:start position:0%
december-ish somewhere at some point doe
 
00:59:32.270 --> 00:59:32.280 align:start position:0%
prior to January would have at least the
 
00:59:32.280 --> 00:59:33.589 align:start position:0%
prior to January would have at least the
number

00:59:33.589 --> 00:59:33.599 align:start position:0%
number
 
00:59:35.750 --> 00:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
um that are there this year I think he's
 
00:59:37.910 --> 00:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
as a baseline absolutely two thousand
 
00:59:39.349 --> 00:59:39.359 align:start position:0%
something better than something this
 
00:59:41.030 --> 00:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
matter is good and I appreciate you
 
00:59:43.609 --> 00:59:43.619 align:start position:0%
getting that and no disrespect but it's
 
00:59:45.289 --> 00:59:45.299 align:start position:0%
six five years old
 
00:59:47.990 --> 00:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
it's not your fault you bring Kobe but
 
00:59:49.849 --> 00:59:49.859 align:start position:0%
that so when we go back in you know what
 
00:59:52.430 --> 00:59:52.440 align:start position:0%
I mean yeah no I mean I'm just saying
 
00:59:54.530 --> 00:59:54.540 align:start position:0%
that that's all I do think it's thank
 
00:59:57.470 --> 00:59:57.480 align:start position:0%
you very helpful though to be able to
 
00:59:57.480 --> 00:59:58.549 align:start position:0%
you very helpful though to be able to
look

00:59:58.549 --> 00:59:58.559 align:start position:0%
look
 
01:00:00.069 --> 01:00:00.079 align:start position:0%
um at
 
01:00:03.890 --> 01:00:03.900 align:start position:0%
ratios and percentages uh from 2018 and
 
01:00:06.470 --> 01:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
19. you know what not what percentage of
 
01:00:08.930 --> 01:00:08.940 align:start position:0%
kids were reduced were free we're full
 
01:00:08.940 --> 01:00:10.490 align:start position:0%
kids were reduced were free we're full
Fair

01:00:10.490 --> 01:00:10.500 align:start position:0%
Fair
 
01:00:14.030 --> 01:00:14.040 align:start position:0%
um because we would hope that that's at
 
01:00:16.609 --> 01:00:16.619 align:start position:0%
least a ballpark figure and that's why I
 
01:00:17.930 --> 01:00:17.940 align:start position:0%
was asking percentage rate over here
 
01:00:19.730 --> 01:00:19.740 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you
 
01:00:19.740 --> 01:00:21.710 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you
question

01:00:21.710 --> 01:00:21.720 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:00:24.589 --> 01:00:24.599 align:start position:0%
um I wanted to answer yep answer
 
01:00:30.349 --> 01:00:30.359 align:start position:0%
um so what I can do is I can use the
 
01:00:30.359 --> 01:00:30.950 align:start position:0%
um so what I can do is I can use the
um

01:00:30.950 --> 01:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:35.750 --> 01:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
eligibility from 2021 so you can have an
 
01:00:38.690 --> 01:00:38.700 align:start position:0%
answer before so you can have some sort
 
01:00:41.809 --> 01:00:41.819 align:start position:0%
of answer based off of the free reduced
 
01:00:46.069 --> 01:00:46.079 align:start position:0%
and then everybody else from the 164
 
01:00:48.289 --> 01:00:48.299 align:start position:0%
that does not fit into the free or
 
01:00:50.990 --> 01:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
reduce would be uh would be paid so then
 
01:00:53.150 --> 01:00:53.160 align:start position:0%
you'd have that cost associated with
 
01:00:55.670 --> 01:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
that does that sound that is superb okay
 
01:00:57.670 --> 01:00:57.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:01:00.770 --> 01:01:00.780 align:start position:0%
representative Lucas I just wanted to
 
01:01:02.210 --> 01:01:02.220 align:start position:0%
comment on what you said about the
 
01:01:04.490 --> 01:01:04.500 align:start position:0%
number of kids grabbing lunches and
 
01:01:06.289 --> 01:01:06.299 align:start position:0%
picturing back when I was in school and
 
01:01:08.750 --> 01:01:08.760 align:start position:0%
I had I mean breakfasts I had breakfast
 
01:01:10.730 --> 01:01:10.740 align:start position:0%
every morning but believe me if I'd have
 
01:01:12.710 --> 01:01:12.720 align:start position:0%
been able to grab and go it would have
 
01:01:14.270 --> 01:01:14.280 align:start position:0%
meant I could have slept in later I'd
 
01:01:15.770 --> 01:01:15.780 align:start position:0%
have grabbed and gone
 
01:01:17.210 --> 01:01:17.220 align:start position:0%
you had to walk up and down the hill
 
01:01:22.030 --> 01:01:22.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:24.950 --> 01:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
chairman Ladd thank you very much for
 
01:01:26.510 --> 01:01:26.520 align:start position:0%
the Department
 
01:01:30.410 --> 01:01:30.420 align:start position:0%
um is there any way that we can find out
 
01:01:31.789 --> 01:01:31.799 align:start position:0%
in the high school
 
01:01:34.490 --> 01:01:34.500 align:start position:0%
all the students which are eligible I
 
01:01:36.170 --> 01:01:36.180 align:start position:0%
know that I used to as a school
 
01:01:38.630 --> 01:01:38.640 align:start position:0%
principal by looking at the elementary
 
01:01:41.510 --> 01:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
applications that came in we'd also see
 
01:01:43.490 --> 01:01:43.500 align:start position:0%
that they had X number of students in
 
01:01:45.829 --> 01:01:45.839 align:start position:0%
the high school and we gave credit for
 
01:01:48.410 --> 01:01:48.420 align:start position:0%
those kids even those students very
 
01:01:50.450 --> 01:01:50.460 align:start position:0%
rarely in the high school brought the
 
01:01:52.130 --> 01:01:52.140 align:start position:0%
application back in
 
01:01:54.410 --> 01:01:54.420 align:start position:0%
so if we were to add in all those
 
01:01:56.750 --> 01:01:56.760 align:start position:0%
youngsters that are from eligible
 
01:01:59.270 --> 01:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
families I think we'd get a better
 
01:02:01.250 --> 01:02:01.260 align:start position:0%
number another thought that I've had
 
01:02:03.250 --> 01:02:03.260 align:start position:0%
after listening to conversation here
 
01:02:06.589 --> 01:02:06.599 align:start position:0%
that where I see this happening in
 
01:02:08.690 --> 01:02:08.700 align:start position:0%
Vermont right now and I see it happening
 
01:02:10.670 --> 01:02:10.680 align:start position:0%
even at the high school where I have a
 
01:02:12.470 --> 01:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
couple high schoolers attending at St
 
01:02:14.030 --> 01:02:14.040 align:start position:0%
Johnsbury Academy which is a Vermont
 
01:02:16.069 --> 01:02:16.079 align:start position:0%
high school and then some in the Middle
 
01:02:18.589 --> 01:02:18.599 align:start position:0%
School in West Barnet uh the ones in
 
01:02:20.990 --> 01:02:21.000 align:start position:0%
West Barnett absolutely depend upon that
 
01:02:22.730 --> 01:02:22.740 align:start position:0%
breakfast even though they're capable of
 
01:02:24.170 --> 01:02:24.180 align:start position:0%
having but they usually are getting up
 
01:02:26.089 --> 01:02:26.099 align:start position:0%
late trying to get on the bus and
 
01:02:27.589 --> 01:02:27.599 align:start position:0%
there's probably no breakfast in them
 
01:02:29.329 --> 01:02:29.339 align:start position:0%
but they get to school and there is
 
01:02:32.450 --> 01:02:32.460 align:start position:0%
would it be but the ones that get to the
 
01:02:34.490 --> 01:02:34.500 align:start position:0%
academy which has a thousand kids and
 
01:02:36.650 --> 01:02:36.660 align:start position:0%
it's about one-third size Pinkerton but
 
01:02:38.530 --> 01:02:38.540 align:start position:0%
it's a good side school
 
01:02:41.150 --> 01:02:41.160 align:start position:0%
they go right into their structured
 
01:02:43.010 --> 01:02:43.020 align:start position:0%
schedule day where they have to go and
 
01:02:44.510 --> 01:02:44.520 align:start position:0%
all the block scheduling and they're on
 
01:02:46.490 --> 01:02:46.500 align:start position:0%
their way and they very rarely have the
 
01:02:47.990 --> 01:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
chance to do something like this because
 
01:02:49.309 --> 01:02:49.319 align:start position:0%
they're traveling from eight different
 
01:02:51.770 --> 01:02:51.780 align:start position:0%
communities and they time it so they
 
01:02:53.450 --> 01:02:53.460 align:start position:0%
just get that they're on time for
 
01:02:55.730 --> 01:02:55.740 align:start position:0%
getting into what they call they call it
 
01:02:57.530 --> 01:02:57.540 align:start position:0%
Chapel but it's basically the First
 
01:02:59.089 --> 01:02:59.099 align:start position:0%
Assembly of the day where they give all
 
01:03:00.530 --> 01:03:00.540 align:start position:0%
the information about what's happening
 
01:03:02.210 --> 01:03:02.220 align:start position:0%
that day and then on to their classes
 
01:03:04.490 --> 01:03:04.500 align:start position:0%
and they're required to be in that first
 
01:03:08.329 --> 01:03:08.339 align:start position:0%
session so I it would be a good idea to
 
01:03:10.849 --> 01:03:10.859 align:start position:0%
try to phase in a program like this
 
01:03:14.270 --> 01:03:14.280 align:start position:0%
phase it in first with the grades which
 
01:03:16.309 --> 01:03:16.319 align:start position:0%
I feel are really critical and that's
 
01:03:18.829 --> 01:03:18.839 align:start position:0%
your they're all critical yes but the
 
01:03:21.589 --> 01:03:21.599 align:start position:0%
Elementary grades K through six or or
 
01:03:23.530 --> 01:03:23.540 align:start position:0%
even if it's a k through eight building
 
01:03:26.690 --> 01:03:26.700 align:start position:0%
to face this program in see how it's
 
01:03:28.730 --> 01:03:28.740 align:start position:0%
work and then take the next leap to the
 
01:03:30.589 --> 01:03:30.599 align:start position:0%
high school are there any states which
 
01:03:32.450 --> 01:03:32.460 align:start position:0%
are phasing this type of program and
 
01:03:34.069 --> 01:03:34.079 align:start position:0%
rather than going Whole Hog like Vermont
 
01:03:37.010 --> 01:03:37.020 align:start position:0%
by fy23 we're gonna We appropriate these
 
01:03:38.210 --> 01:03:38.220 align:start position:0%
dollars and everybody's in the program
 
01:03:41.270 --> 01:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
yeah I I don't know about states that
 
01:03:43.370 --> 01:03:43.380 align:start position:0%
are facing them in the only information
 
01:03:47.030 --> 01:03:47.040 align:start position:0%
that I asked for from uh Jennifer four
 
01:03:49.849 --> 01:03:49.859 align:start position:0%
was on States that had similar
 
01:03:52.549 --> 01:03:52.559 align:start position:0%
demographics to New Hampshire so there
 
01:03:54.829 --> 01:03:54.839 align:start position:0%
may be other states out there that are
 
01:03:56.990 --> 01:03:57.000 align:start position:0%
doing a whole host of things that we
 
01:03:59.030 --> 01:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
haven't even taken a look at we were
 
01:04:02.109 --> 01:04:02.119 align:start position:0%
looking at you know population
 
01:04:07.130 --> 01:04:07.140 align:start position:0%
uh annual income size that kind of
 
01:04:10.549 --> 01:04:10.559 align:start position:0%
so uh yeah that would take additional
 
01:04:12.170 --> 01:04:12.180 align:start position:0%
research yeah in the Medicaid
 
01:04:13.789 --> 01:04:13.799 align:start position:0%
Eligibility thing which we've talked so
 
01:04:15.650 --> 01:04:15.660 align:start position:0%
much about in the past is absolutely
 
01:04:17.690 --> 01:04:17.700 align:start position:0%
critical to this yeah they met more
 
01:04:21.049 --> 01:04:21.059 align:start position:0%
students it will more students we we've
 
01:04:22.849 --> 01:04:22.859 align:start position:0%
got that data from the Health and Human
 
01:04:24.589 --> 01:04:24.599 align:start position:0%
Service that's the direct certification
 
01:04:28.010 --> 01:04:28.020 align:start position:0%
yes yeah USDA they're they're involved
 
01:04:29.210 --> 01:04:29.220 align:start position:0%
with this and there are some states
 
01:04:31.970 --> 01:04:31.980 align:start position:0%
doing rather than free and reduce f r
 
01:04:33.530 --> 01:04:33.540 align:start position:0%
program now they're using the Medicaid
 
01:04:36.650 --> 01:04:36.660 align:start position:0%
information to identify all the eligible
 
01:04:39.890 --> 01:04:39.900 align:start position:0%
students in in the K-12 schools
 
01:04:41.930 --> 01:04:41.940 align:start position:0%
I would just know because I'm glad if I
 
01:04:44.930 --> 01:04:44.940 align:start position:0%
could um New Mexico
 
01:04:48.589 --> 01:04:48.599 align:start position:0%
um requires their statute requires
 
01:04:50.270 --> 01:04:50.280 align:start position:0%
um funding for the breakfast after
 
01:04:53.870 --> 01:04:53.880 align:start position:0%
developed for all the schools but only
 
01:04:56.809 --> 01:04:56.819 align:start position:0%
elementary schools have been funded so
 
01:04:59.349 --> 01:04:59.359 align:start position:0%
far something yeah so it's a phase
 
01:05:02.089 --> 01:05:02.099 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah
 
01:05:03.829 --> 01:05:03.839 align:start position:0%
that was the one I think that it said it
 
01:05:05.569 --> 01:05:05.579 align:start position:0%
doesn't apply to metal and nine through
 
01:05:11.270 --> 01:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:14.630 --> 01:05:14.640 align:start position:0%
as a former High School principal I I
 
01:05:16.910 --> 01:05:16.920 align:start position:0%
would be reluctant to wave those
 
01:05:18.589 --> 01:05:18.599 align:start position:0%
youngsters off and let them phase in
 
01:05:21.789 --> 01:05:21.799 align:start position:0%
they're equally hungry in the morning
 
01:05:21.799 --> 01:05:23.329 align:start position:0%
they're equally hungry in the morning
yeah

01:05:23.329 --> 01:05:23.339 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:05:25.490 --> 01:05:25.500 align:start position:0%
they're hungry right
 
01:05:27.289 --> 01:05:27.299 align:start position:0%
they're big they're growing especially
 
01:05:30.370 --> 01:05:30.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:38.990 --> 01:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:42.230 --> 01:05:42.240 align:start position:0%
Kelly thank you so very much for coming
 
01:05:45.230 --> 01:05:45.240 align:start position:0%
again and being able to uh review the
 
01:05:47.030 --> 01:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
information that you gave us you're
 
01:05:49.130 --> 01:05:49.140 align:start position:0%
welcome I'm happy to whatever
 
01:05:51.289 --> 01:05:51.299 align:start position:0%
information I can get I'm happy to
 
01:05:53.589 --> 01:05:53.599 align:start position:0%
provide that yeah well we we
 
01:05:57.109 --> 01:05:57.119 align:start position:0%
sincerely appreciate it you're welcome
 
01:06:00.109 --> 01:06:00.119 align:start position:0%
okay so the last state that we looked at
 
01:06:02.150 --> 01:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
was West Virginia
 
01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:03.530 align:start position:0%
was West Virginia
and

01:06:03.530 --> 01:06:03.540 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:06:05.630 --> 01:06:05.640 align:start position:0%
um you know how you have sister
 
01:06:08.809 --> 01:06:08.819 align:start position:0%
communities in other countries or other
 
01:06:11.150 --> 01:06:11.160 align:start position:0%
states I read West Virginia and I
 
01:06:14.030 --> 01:06:14.040 align:start position:0%
thought oh these are a lot like the fine
 
01:06:17.210 --> 01:06:17.220 align:start position:0%
folks in New Hampshire they require a
 
01:06:19.670 --> 01:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
school nutrition program but it doesn't
 
01:06:22.010 --> 01:06:22.020 align:start position:0%
have to be the federal one
 
01:06:25.190 --> 01:06:25.200 align:start position:0%
the West Virginia feed to achieve act
 
01:06:27.410 --> 01:06:27.420 align:start position:0%
requires the Board of Education to
 
01:06:29.750 --> 01:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
establish and operate nutritional
 
01:06:33.410 --> 01:06:33.420 align:start position:0%
programs for breakfast and lunch and the
 
01:06:35.809 --> 01:06:35.819 align:start position:0%
legislation envisions building funding
 
01:06:39.230 --> 01:06:39.240 align:start position:0%
through donations contributions payments
 
01:06:41.329 --> 01:06:41.339 align:start position:0%
made by individuals
 
01:06:45.049 --> 01:06:45.059 align:start position:0%
communities businesses organizations and
 
01:06:47.029 --> 01:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
parents or Guardians on behalf of
 
01:06:50.690 --> 01:06:50.700 align:start position:0%
students so what they're proposing is
 
01:06:53.150 --> 01:06:53.160 align:start position:0%
their own nutrition system that each
 
01:06:55.069 --> 01:06:55.079 align:start position:0%
School must provide breakfast and lunch
 
01:06:59.690 --> 01:06:59.700 align:start position:0%
but they're going to uh basically at
 
01:07:03.470 --> 01:07:03.480 align:start position:0%
least to some degree privately funded uh
 
01:07:06.410 --> 01:07:06.420 align:start position:0%
as I said breakfast is required also
 
01:07:10.549 --> 01:07:10.559 align:start position:0%
part of the Virginia code is the
 
01:07:12.950 --> 01:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
requirement that each County Board and
 
01:07:16.130 --> 01:07:16.140 align:start position:0%
Department of Education establish a fund
 
01:07:19.789 --> 01:07:19.799 align:start position:0%
or a non-profit Foundation to accept
 
01:07:22.789 --> 01:07:22.799 align:start position:0%
gifts grants or be Quests for the
 
01:07:25.849 --> 01:07:25.859 align:start position:0%
purpose of funding approved School meals
 
01:07:25.859 --> 01:07:27.650 align:start position:0%
purpose of funding approved School meals
programs

01:07:27.650 --> 01:07:27.660 align:start position:0%
programs
 
01:07:29.750 --> 01:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
the funds may also be used
 
01:07:32.390 --> 01:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock to supply
 
01:07:35.390 --> 01:07:35.400 align:start position:0%
students with nutritious Foods over the
 
01:07:37.849 --> 01:07:37.859 align:start position:0%
weekend you and I had a conversation
 
01:07:41.470 --> 01:07:41.480 align:start position:0%
about the 68 hours of hunger program
 
01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:43.029 align:start position:0%
about the 68 hours of hunger program
which

01:07:43.029 --> 01:07:43.039 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:07:45.470 --> 01:07:45.480 align:start position:0%
quite a few of our New Hampshire schools
 
01:07:47.750 --> 01:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
are participating in the backpack
 
01:07:51.770 --> 01:07:51.780 align:start position:0%
initiative that kids go home with a
 
01:07:54.529 --> 01:07:54.539 align:start position:0%
backpack full of food at the end of the
 
01:07:56.210 --> 01:07:56.220 align:start position:0%
week so that they can get over the
 
01:07:58.250 --> 01:07:58.260 align:start position:0%
weekend before they're coming back to
 
01:08:00.589 --> 01:08:00.599 align:start position:0%
school where many of them are having
 
01:08:00.599 --> 01:08:01.690 align:start position:0%
school where many of them are having
their

01:08:01.690 --> 01:08:01.700 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:08:04.730 --> 01:08:04.740 align:start position:0%
most substantial food in intake during
 
01:08:06.049 --> 01:08:06.059 align:start position:0%
the day
 
01:08:08.450 --> 01:08:08.460 align:start position:0%
there's no school the school provides
 
01:08:09.710 --> 01:08:09.720 align:start position:0%
the alternative Monday through Friday
 
01:08:11.630 --> 01:08:11.640 align:start position:0%
but they still have nothing to eat on
 
01:08:13.250 --> 01:08:13.260 align:start position:0%
the weekends that's exactly right rather
 
01:08:16.970 --> 01:08:16.980 align:start position:0%
them all right uh West Virginia also is
 
01:08:21.010 --> 01:08:21.020 align:start position:0%
uh has a shared table initiative
 
01:08:24.410 --> 01:08:24.420 align:start position:0%
we looked into that last session we went
 
01:08:29.269 --> 01:08:29.279 align:start position:0%
as far as uh adopting the frozen food
 
01:08:32.709 --> 01:08:32.719 align:start position:0%
aspect of what to do with excess Foods
 
01:08:36.769 --> 01:08:36.779 align:start position:0%
so we did take that step in West
 
01:08:39.650 --> 01:08:39.660 align:start position:0%
Virginia they're also looking at the
 
01:08:42.789 --> 01:08:42.799 align:start position:0%
health requirements through the USDA
 
01:08:46.490 --> 01:08:46.500 align:start position:0%
through the county health boards and
 
01:08:48.829 --> 01:08:48.839 align:start position:0%
also looking at what kinds of foods have
 
01:08:52.309 --> 01:08:52.319 align:start position:0%
to be are allowed to be distributed we
 
01:08:54.590 --> 01:08:54.600 align:start position:0%
talked a little bit about that last time
 
01:08:58.249 --> 01:08:58.259 align:start position:0%
or around last session but we didn't
 
01:09:00.769 --> 01:09:00.779 align:start position:0%
we we had we had information that where
 
01:09:03.550 --> 01:09:03.560 align:start position:0%
we were limited and what could be
 
01:09:06.470 --> 01:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
redistributed but
 
01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:07.669 align:start position:0%
redistributed but
um

01:09:07.669 --> 01:09:07.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:09.769 --> 01:09:09.779 align:start position:0%
I don't know how that would apply to a
 
01:09:11.870 --> 01:09:11.880 align:start position:0%
privately run program
 
01:09:14.269 --> 01:09:14.279 align:start position:0%
you know if it's a privately run and
 
01:09:15.829 --> 01:09:15.839 align:start position:0%
privately funded program I don't know
 
01:09:17.470 --> 01:09:17.480 align:start position:0%
whether or not the law would be the same
 
01:09:20.209 --> 01:09:20.219 align:start position:0%
but it's an interesting concept
 
01:09:23.030 --> 01:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
representative Lucas yeah the the uh
 
01:09:25.309 --> 01:09:25.319 align:start position:0%
what I've seen in a number of states it
 
01:09:28.189 --> 01:09:28.199 align:start position:0%
seems like yeah they regulate all kinds
 
01:09:30.789 --> 01:09:30.799 align:start position:0%
of stuff and even when people have had
 
01:09:33.709 --> 01:09:33.719 align:start position:0%
meals you know Sunday lunch meals or
 
01:09:37.070 --> 01:09:37.080 align:start position:0%
weekday meals in the park that volunteer
 
01:09:39.890 --> 01:09:39.900 align:start position:0%
organizations were providing the
 
01:09:43.130 --> 01:09:43.140 align:start position:0%
wonderful USDA came and shut them down
 
01:09:50.150 --> 01:09:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:52.789 --> 01:09:52.799 align:start position:0%
certainly discouraging if you're trying
 
01:09:55.189 --> 01:09:55.199 align:start position:0%
to feed hungry kids right you know you
 
01:09:56.930 --> 01:09:56.940 align:start position:0%
hate to see them
 
01:09:59.570 --> 01:09:59.580 align:start position:0%
cherry picking off of their lunch trays
 
01:10:03.410 --> 01:10:03.420 align:start position:0%
and then uh somebody who might want what
 
01:10:06.110 --> 01:10:06.120 align:start position:0%
Muriel isn't going to eat is denied the
 
01:10:07.970 --> 01:10:07.980 align:start position:0%
opportunity because murals had it
 
01:10:10.910 --> 01:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
sitting in front of her so yeah
 
01:10:16.450 --> 01:10:16.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:21.410 --> 01:10:21.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:24.169 --> 01:10:24.179 align:start position:0%
the program which we discussed several
 
01:10:26.930 --> 01:10:26.940 align:start position:0%
years ago was the program in Indiana
 
01:10:29.030 --> 01:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
and I'd be curious to know that was
 
01:10:31.610 --> 01:10:31.620 align:start position:0%
where the leftover frozen food was taken
 
01:10:33.950 --> 01:10:33.960 align:start position:0%
home and distributed to the families I'd
 
01:10:36.050 --> 01:10:36.060 align:start position:0%
be curious to know how that program has
 
01:10:36.060 --> 01:10:38.149 align:start position:0%
be curious to know how that program has
progressed

01:10:38.149 --> 01:10:38.159 align:start position:0%
progressed
 
01:10:40.850 --> 01:10:40.860 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire adopted its own program
 
01:10:42.770 --> 01:10:42.780 align:start position:0%
curious to see there they started before
 
01:10:45.290 --> 01:10:45.300 align:start position:0%
we did right right what they may have
 
01:10:47.149 --> 01:10:47.159 align:start position:0%
found out about it or anything to make
 
01:10:48.590 --> 01:10:48.600 align:start position:0%
it a stronger program that'd be great
 
01:10:50.689 --> 01:10:50.699 align:start position:0%
for us yep
 
01:10:53.450 --> 01:10:53.460 align:start position:0%
the other thing when we talk local when
 
01:10:55.490 --> 01:10:55.500 align:start position:0%
we talk about local produce and locally
 
01:10:59.090 --> 01:10:59.100 align:start position:0%
raised here I hope we don't go to the
 
01:11:01.430 --> 01:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
degree that Maine has gone and it has to
 
01:11:03.649 --> 01:11:03.659 align:start position:0%
be from the state of Maine
 
01:11:06.649 --> 01:11:06.659 align:start position:0%
uh local up my neck of the woods is both
 
01:11:08.209 --> 01:11:08.219 align:start position:0%
sides of the river
 
01:11:11.270 --> 01:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
and in fact most of the land now that's
 
01:11:13.790 --> 01:11:13.800 align:start position:0%
been farmed in New Hampshire is owned by
 
01:11:15.290 --> 01:11:15.300 align:start position:0%
people in Vermont
 
01:11:18.050 --> 01:11:18.060 align:start position:0%
and so I would think that we'd want to
 
01:11:21.830 --> 01:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
have produce local by maybe some kind of
 
01:11:26.149 --> 01:11:26.159 align:start position:0%
a radius or or or New England yeah
 
01:11:29.209 --> 01:11:29.219 align:start position:0%
there's something we want to look at
 
01:11:30.830 --> 01:11:30.840 align:start position:0%
I know the Hannaford when they're
 
01:11:32.270 --> 01:11:32.280 align:start position:0%
selling food in the stores now they're
 
01:11:35.090 --> 01:11:35.100 align:start position:0%
calling locally raised produced food is
 
01:11:38.149 --> 01:11:38.159 align:start position:0%
from me and and uh which that's where
 
01:11:40.910 --> 01:11:40.920 align:start position:0%
Hannaford's out of but uh that they
 
01:11:43.790 --> 01:11:43.800 align:start position:0%
consider that still local here in uh
 
01:11:46.550 --> 01:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
where I shop over in Bradford Vermont I
 
01:11:48.709 --> 01:11:48.719 align:start position:0%
haven't seen that down in the Hanford
 
01:11:51.410 --> 01:11:51.420 align:start position:0%
store in Plymouth but uh I think it's
 
01:11:53.570 --> 01:11:53.580 align:start position:0%
important that we try to spread it out a
 
01:11:57.410 --> 01:11:57.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:57.420 --> 01:12:01.250 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:12:01.250 --> 01:12:01.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:04.669 --> 01:12:04.679 align:start position:0%
okay so that's all I have in terms of
 
01:12:07.990 --> 01:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
the research that Jen provided us with
 
01:12:11.570 --> 01:12:11.580 align:start position:0%
at the very least I think we have a body
 
01:12:15.430 --> 01:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
of information here that begs questions
 
01:12:19.130 --> 01:12:19.140 align:start position:0%
uh that would be worthwhile to answer if
 
01:12:20.330 --> 01:12:20.340 align:start position:0%
we can
 
01:12:24.890 --> 01:12:24.900 align:start position:0%
certainly get answers to the questions
 
01:12:24.900 --> 01:12:25.729 align:start position:0%
certainly get answers to the questions
um

01:12:25.729 --> 01:12:25.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:29.470 --> 01:12:29.480 align:start position:0%
on a personal note I will say that I
 
01:12:33.830 --> 01:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:35.510 --> 01:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
again I'll go back to that word
 
01:12:37.689 --> 01:12:37.699 align:start position:0%
disheartening I I have found it
 
01:12:41.330 --> 01:12:41.340 align:start position:0%
disheartening not to be able to do
 
01:12:44.090 --> 01:12:44.100 align:start position:0%
something about feeding hungry kids you
 
01:12:50.209 --> 01:12:50.219 align:start position:0%
know uh and I I I understand that
 
01:12:52.490 --> 01:12:52.500 align:start position:0%
we need to have Federal reimbursement
 
01:12:55.610 --> 01:12:55.620 align:start position:0%
obviously to the best of our abilities
 
01:12:58.030 --> 01:12:58.040 align:start position:0%
we need to be able to access the federal
 
01:13:01.610 --> 01:13:01.620 align:start position:0%
dollars that are out there uh and you
 
01:13:03.169 --> 01:13:03.179 align:start position:0%
know whether or not we should be looking
 
01:13:06.709 --> 01:13:06.719 align:start position:0%
at how we go about collecting the data
 
01:13:08.689 --> 01:13:08.699 align:start position:0%
on free and reduced lunch kids and
 
01:13:11.390 --> 01:13:11.400 align:start position:0%
whether or not there is a way that we
 
01:13:13.130 --> 01:13:13.140 align:start position:0%
can collect data to get higher
 
01:13:15.709 --> 01:13:15.719 align:start position:0%
participation from people that are
 
01:13:18.110 --> 01:13:18.120 align:start position:0%
actually eligible for the program I mean
 
01:13:20.570 --> 01:13:20.580 align:start position:0%
that certainly would be something that I
 
01:13:23.270 --> 01:13:23.280 align:start position:0%
would be interested in uh representative
 
01:13:25.370 --> 01:13:25.380 align:start position:0%
Woodcock and I would call it from the
 
01:13:26.930 --> 01:13:26.940 align:start position:0%
meeting we had with representative Ladd
 
01:13:30.590 --> 01:13:30.600 align:start position:0%
and his committee on 1680 last week
 
01:13:33.310 --> 01:13:33.320 align:start position:0%
There's clearly a lot of dialogue about
 
01:13:35.990 --> 01:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh how we measure achievement
 
01:13:37.430 --> 01:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
standardized tests and all those things
 
01:13:39.410 --> 01:13:39.420 align:start position:0%
it seems pretty clear to me that
 
01:13:41.990 --> 01:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
regardless how we measure uh those
 
01:13:44.870 --> 01:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
numbers uh for the state Rick are going
 
01:13:46.850 --> 01:13:46.860 align:start position:0%
to go up when we have a whole County of
 
01:13:48.770 --> 01:13:48.780 align:start position:0%
youngsters New Hampshire that have fed
 
01:13:50.570 --> 01:13:50.580 align:start position:0%
and get the nutrition the meal the in
 
01:13:52.310 --> 01:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
every single day that our achievous boys
 
01:13:54.649 --> 01:13:54.659 align:start position:0%
have to go up and have hungry kids try
 
01:13:56.090 --> 01:13:56.100 align:start position:0%
to take tests you don't have to convince
 
01:13:59.209 --> 01:13:59.219 align:start position:0%
me on that oh no no I agree with you I'm
 
01:14:01.310 --> 01:14:01.320 align:start position:0%
there yeah no no are you my wife you
 
01:14:02.270 --> 01:14:02.280 align:start position:0%
brought the light the other day yeah
 
01:14:05.810 --> 01:14:05.820 align:start position:0%
yeah and my biggest concern is that I'm
 
01:14:07.970 --> 01:14:07.980 align:start position:0%
looking at a number of programs which we
 
01:14:10.430 --> 01:14:10.440 align:start position:0%
you know require or have for the state
 
01:14:12.890 --> 01:14:12.900 align:start position:0%
has to support school districts in
 
01:14:14.990 --> 01:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
various tasks like building a
 
01:14:17.870 --> 01:14:17.880 align:start position:0%
and whether we have those programs
 
01:14:19.970 --> 01:14:19.980 align:start position:0%
there's some ownership on the part of
 
01:14:24.410 --> 01:14:24.420 align:start position:0%
the locals the state may provide uh 70
 
01:14:28.270 --> 01:14:28.280 align:start position:0%
of a grant and 30 has to be done locally
 
01:14:30.590 --> 01:14:30.600 align:start position:0%
I think with a little ownership in the
 
01:14:32.990 --> 01:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
game I think that would help uh when
 
01:14:35.810 --> 01:14:35.820 align:start position:0%
we're talking about you know 29 30
 
01:14:38.149 --> 01:14:38.159 align:start position:0%
million dollars you know we're talking
 
01:14:39.950 --> 01:14:39.960 align:start position:0%
about the availability of the school
 
01:14:42.490 --> 01:14:42.500 align:start position:0%
building Aid each year of being now
 
01:14:45.410 --> 01:14:45.420 align:start position:0%
upwards towards 25 million dollars a
 
01:14:47.630 --> 01:14:47.640 align:start position:0%
year we out we appropriate 50 million
 
01:14:51.350 --> 01:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
but half of that's David and so and and
 
01:14:53.209 --> 01:14:53.219 align:start position:0%
the same thing with all those types of
 
01:14:57.590 --> 01:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
programs so it'd be really it I I kind
 
01:14:59.870 --> 01:14:59.880 align:start position:0%
of concur we shouldn't the phase in just
 
01:15:01.790 --> 01:15:01.800 align:start position:0%
certain grades that's maybe one option
 
01:15:04.070 --> 01:15:04.080 align:start position:0%
to try and get it in all grades is a
 
01:15:06.290 --> 01:15:06.300 align:start position:0%
better option but to do that there may
 
01:15:09.050 --> 01:15:09.060 align:start position:0%
be have to be some optional buy-in on
 
01:15:12.050 --> 01:15:12.060 align:start position:0%
the part of the local saying that and
 
01:15:13.850 --> 01:15:13.860 align:start position:0%
showing the benefits in marketing this
 
01:15:17.630 --> 01:15:17.640 align:start position:0%
program properly and then I see in terms
 
01:15:19.850 --> 01:15:19.860 align:start position:0%
of my town which is a rural community
 
01:15:21.649 --> 01:15:21.659 align:start position:0%
but one that's always been very
 
01:15:24.169 --> 01:15:24.179 align:start position:0%
thoughtful of social organizations when
 
01:15:25.669 --> 01:15:25.679 align:start position:0%
it comes to our warrant articles they
 
01:15:27.410 --> 01:15:27.420 align:start position:0%
would probably be the same when it came
 
01:15:29.950 --> 01:15:29.960 align:start position:0%
to feeding kids
 
01:15:33.470 --> 01:15:33.480 align:start position:0%
thank you my point was that youngsters
 
01:15:35.630 --> 01:15:35.640 align:start position:0%
who get a good nice rest
 
01:15:38.870 --> 01:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
and have a full nutritional uh system of
 
01:15:40.850 --> 01:15:40.860 align:start position:0%
meals throughout the day I'm going to
 
01:15:40.860 --> 01:15:42.070 align:start position:0%
meals throughout the day I'm going to
succeed

01:15:42.070 --> 01:15:42.080 align:start position:0%
succeed
 
01:15:44.330 --> 01:15:44.340 align:start position:0%
academically better than those
 
01:15:45.770 --> 01:15:45.780 align:start position:0%
youngsters that can't sleep at night
 
01:15:46.729 --> 01:15:46.739 align:start position:0%
because they're hungry will come to
 
01:15:48.709 --> 01:15:48.719 align:start position:0%
school hungry all day so the numbers
 
01:15:51.050 --> 01:15:51.060 align:start position:0%
that we're talking in 1680 on the
 
01:15:52.970 --> 01:15:52.980 align:start position:0%
academic achievement of New Hampshire
 
01:15:55.250 --> 01:15:55.260 align:start position:0%
clearly this is one part of that that
 
01:15:58.149 --> 01:15:58.159 align:start position:0%
could help thank you
 
01:16:00.590 --> 01:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
representative Lucas
 
01:16:02.750 --> 01:16:02.760 align:start position:0%
yeah I just wanted to mention two
 
01:16:07.370 --> 01:16:07.380 align:start position:0%
cautions one is in uh saying that a
 
01:16:10.189 --> 01:16:10.199 align:start position:0%
school one of the states said that all
 
01:16:11.930 --> 01:16:11.940 align:start position:0%
schools must participate in the federal
 
01:16:15.290 --> 01:16:15.300 align:start position:0%
program and the federal program mandates
 
01:16:17.810 --> 01:16:17.820 align:start position:0%
all kinds of things including the type
 
01:16:20.930 --> 01:16:20.940 align:start position:0%
of food Etc and if kids don't like it
 
01:16:22.610 --> 01:16:22.620 align:start position:0%
they don't eat it look at Londonderry
 
01:16:24.950 --> 01:16:24.960 align:start position:0%
they decided not to do it
 
01:16:27.229 --> 01:16:27.239 align:start position:0%
because the kids were not eating the
 
01:16:28.910 --> 01:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
food because they thought it was
 
01:16:32.930 --> 01:16:32.940 align:start position:0%
disgusting and I can understand that I
 
01:16:35.270 --> 01:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
remember Michelle Obama apples and my
 
01:16:37.070 --> 01:16:37.080 align:start position:0%
daughter would take her Max Apple Farm
 
01:16:40.130 --> 01:16:40.140 align:start position:0%
Apple in and say I have an apple I just
 
01:16:42.169 --> 01:16:42.179 align:start position:0%
want to buy the carton of milk and
 
01:16:44.030 --> 01:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
they'd say no you can't buy the carton
 
01:16:46.370 --> 01:16:46.380 align:start position:0%
of milk unless you have a Michelle Obama
 
01:16:49.070 --> 01:16:49.080 align:start position:0%
apple and the Michelle Obama apples were
 
01:16:51.290 --> 01:16:51.300 align:start position:0%
hard and bitter and terrible and she had
 
01:16:54.530 --> 01:16:54.540 align:start position:0%
a wonderful Max apple and so they ended
 
01:16:57.470 --> 01:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
up with a barrel of apples that they fed
 
01:16:59.510 --> 01:16:59.520 align:start position:0%
the donkeys with because we have an AG
 
01:16:59.520 --> 01:17:00.830 align:start position:0%
the donkeys with because we have an AG
School

01:17:00.830 --> 01:17:00.840 align:start position:0%
School
 
01:17:03.470 --> 01:17:03.480 align:start position:0%
and so I just want to wanna because they
 
01:17:05.390 --> 01:17:05.400 align:start position:0%
weren't allowed to mandating serve the
 
01:17:09.530 --> 01:17:09.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:12.649 --> 01:17:12.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:14.770 --> 01:17:14.780 align:start position:0%
so careful when we mandate things right
 
01:17:17.149 --> 01:17:17.159 align:start position:0%
and then the other
 
01:17:17.159 --> 01:17:18.010 align:start position:0%
and then the other
um

01:17:18.010 --> 01:17:18.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:20.570 --> 01:17:20.580 align:start position:0%
Ronald Reagan jelly beans I totally
 
01:17:26.649 --> 01:17:26.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:31.030 --> 01:17:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:37.330 --> 01:17:37.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:40.790 --> 01:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
I took full full responsibility for that
 
01:17:43.130 --> 01:17:43.140 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock yeah I I
 
01:17:44.570 --> 01:17:44.580 align:start position:0%
understand what you're saying
 
01:17:46.669 --> 01:17:46.679 align:start position:0%
representative Lucas and I and I do
 
01:17:48.770 --> 01:17:48.780 align:start position:0%
really as you would expect like the West
 
01:17:50.590 --> 01:17:50.600 align:start position:0%
Virginia Way
 
01:17:53.990 --> 01:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
I I think I even knew that before I
 
01:17:56.030 --> 01:17:56.040 align:start position:0%
brought that up representative I guess
 
01:17:57.709 --> 01:17:57.719 align:start position:0%
but I don't remember what the other
 
01:17:59.870 --> 01:17:59.880 align:start position:0%
thing was totally yeah I mean like
 
01:18:03.470 --> 01:18:03.480 align:start position:0%
anything else you know this we we all
 
01:18:05.570 --> 01:18:05.580 align:start position:0%
acknowledge the fact that we have a pot
 
01:18:08.570 --> 01:18:08.580 align:start position:0%
of money and that the money needs to be
 
01:18:11.510 --> 01:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
distributed and used for different
 
01:18:15.530 --> 01:18:15.540 align:start position:0%
things and uh at some level we all have
 
01:18:17.649 --> 01:18:17.659 align:start position:0%
to decide uh
 
01:18:21.350 --> 01:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
what are how our priorities are our rent
 
01:18:25.430 --> 01:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
and you know uh representative Ladd will
 
01:18:28.970 --> 01:18:28.980 align:start position:0%
talk about ctes with great passion and
 
01:18:31.850 --> 01:18:31.860 align:start position:0%
authority and I will talk about hungry
 
01:18:34.610 --> 01:18:34.620 align:start position:0%
kids in the cafeteria with equal passion
 
01:18:37.430 --> 01:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
uh I won't say Authority though because
 
01:18:39.890 --> 01:18:39.900 align:start position:0%
he probably did cafeteria Duty himself
 
01:18:41.870 --> 01:18:41.880 align:start position:0%
when he was many years yeah
 
01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:46.450 align:start position:0%
when he was many years yeah
representative

01:18:46.450 --> 01:18:46.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:49.070 --> 01:18:49.080 align:start position:0%
I remembered what the other one was and
 
01:18:53.090 --> 01:18:53.100 align:start position:0%
that's sharing personal data and that
 
01:18:55.669 --> 01:18:55.679 align:start position:0%
was the problem with the Medicaid
 
01:18:58.430 --> 01:18:58.440 align:start position:0%
Program is that they were sharing data
 
01:19:00.590 --> 01:19:00.600 align:start position:0%
they would be sharing data with the
 
01:19:02.090 --> 01:19:02.100 align:start position:0%
federal government that people didn't
 
01:19:05.770 --> 01:19:05.780 align:start position:0%
necessarily want shared and given our
 
01:19:08.810 --> 01:19:08.820 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Amendment which says you
 
01:19:08.820 --> 01:19:09.649 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Amendment which says you
know

01:19:09.649 --> 01:19:09.659 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:19:11.750 --> 01:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
another step towards guaranteeing
 
01:19:15.350 --> 01:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
people's privacy we really have to look
 
01:19:17.689 --> 01:19:17.699 align:start position:0%
at that before just saying oh we're
 
01:19:19.430 --> 01:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
going to do this that's another number
 
01:19:21.229 --> 01:19:21.239 align:start position:0%
that I would love to be able to get my
 
01:19:24.169 --> 01:19:24.179 align:start position:0%
hands on like how many people uh you
 
01:19:28.130 --> 01:19:28.140 align:start position:0%
know what what is the percentage of
 
01:19:29.870 --> 01:19:29.880 align:start position:0%
people that would have difficulty
 
01:19:32.390 --> 01:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
sharing their personal data we don't we
 
01:19:34.970 --> 01:19:34.980 align:start position:0%
don't know you know that's uh
 
01:19:36.350 --> 01:19:36.360 align:start position:0%
because of course they're not going to
 
01:19:38.630 --> 01:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
share that because they don't want to
 
01:19:41.030 --> 01:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
it's we are fooling ourselves thinking
 
01:19:42.290 --> 01:19:42.300 align:start position:0%
the federal government doesn't have that
 
01:19:46.010 --> 01:19:46.020 align:start position:0%
data right now when you have an uh IRS
 
01:19:48.470 --> 01:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
is basically knows everything that's in
 
01:19:51.229 --> 01:19:51.239 align:start position:0%
your forms there uh and we wouldn't be
 
01:19:52.850 --> 01:19:52.860 align:start position:0%
through this Medicaid looking for
 
01:19:54.229 --> 01:19:54.239 align:start position:0%
anything further than what's already
 
01:19:56.810 --> 01:19:56.820 align:start position:0%
possessed by them so I think it's a
 
01:19:59.990 --> 01:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
process which would allow us to uh
 
01:20:02.270 --> 01:20:02.280 align:start position:0%
strengthen all our federal grants coming
 
01:20:04.850 --> 01:20:04.860 align:start position:0%
to this state and we're looking at where
 
01:20:07.070 --> 01:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
we can get more Revenue more sources of
 
01:20:09.229 --> 01:20:09.239 align:start position:0%
money we would be look at the CTE
 
01:20:11.689 --> 01:20:11.699 align:start position:0%
program that funding on basically when
 
01:20:13.370 --> 01:20:13.380 align:start position:0%
we're looking at the Carl Perkins Grant
 
01:20:16.850 --> 01:20:16.860 align:start position:0%
is based on part of the fnr uh
 
01:20:19.669 --> 01:20:19.679 align:start position:0%
eligibility and and that it goes down
 
01:20:21.470 --> 01:20:21.480 align:start position:0%
through all of the Esser stuff as well
 
01:20:25.010 --> 01:20:25.020 align:start position:0%
so uh I think we should be open to
 
01:20:27.709 --> 01:20:27.719 align:start position:0%
looking at every Avenue of revenue for
 
01:20:30.110 --> 01:20:30.120 align:start position:0%
this state to function on so
 
01:20:31.729 --> 01:20:31.739 align:start position:0%
um I kind of disagree a little bit with
 
01:20:33.410 --> 01:20:33.420 align:start position:0%
that I think the Peds already have that
 
01:20:33.420 --> 01:20:37.689 align:start position:0%
that I think the Peds already have that
information

01:20:37.689 --> 01:20:37.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:40.310 --> 01:20:40.320 align:start position:0%
representative Ellison I just two quick
 
01:20:42.950 --> 01:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
comments one based on our latest
 
01:20:46.430 --> 01:20:46.440 align:start position:0%
discussion and I was on that that it was
 
01:20:48.470 --> 01:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
a formal it was an informal study
 
01:20:50.870 --> 01:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
committee that that Rick sat up set up
 
01:20:54.110 --> 01:20:54.120 align:start position:0%
and we went through looking at sort of
 
01:20:56.090 --> 01:20:56.100 align:start position:0%
free reduced price the issues we're
 
01:20:57.950 --> 01:20:57.960 align:start position:0%
talking about what are the numbers how
 
01:21:00.709 --> 01:21:00.719 align:start position:0%
can we improve them how and and and I
 
01:21:03.050 --> 01:21:03.060 align:start position:0%
think and I mean I think I'm right that
 
01:21:07.550 --> 01:21:07.560 align:start position:0%
there were four or five states who had
 
01:21:10.729 --> 01:21:10.739 align:start position:0%
figured out how to use Medicaid data in
 
01:21:13.669 --> 01:21:13.679 align:start position:0%
order to vastly increase the number of
 
01:21:15.470 --> 01:21:15.480 align:start position:0%
students who are eligible for free
 
01:21:18.350 --> 01:21:18.360 align:start position:0%
reduced price lunch so I I'm not in the
 
01:21:20.570 --> 01:21:20.580 align:start position:0%
camp of saying well we got privacy
 
01:21:22.850 --> 01:21:22.860 align:start position:0%
issues here so no State should do it
 
01:21:25.430 --> 01:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
because some states are doing it uh
 
01:21:28.070 --> 01:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
secondly just in terms of the the work
 
01:21:30.610 --> 01:21:30.620 align:start position:0%
that we've done and we're going to do
 
01:21:34.970 --> 01:21:34.980 align:start position:0%
there are a whole lot of issues that uh
 
01:21:38.090 --> 01:21:38.100 align:start position:0%
questions issues that need to be studied
 
01:21:41.450 --> 01:21:41.460 align:start position:0%
but I for one need to see action on this
 
01:21:44.090 --> 01:21:44.100 align:start position:0%
kids have to be thin I do not want to
 
01:21:47.090 --> 01:21:47.100 align:start position:0%
spend however many years I have left in
 
01:21:50.990 --> 01:21:51.000 align:start position:0%
this body studying this issue
 
01:21:53.689 --> 01:21:53.699 align:start position:0%
we need to move we need to move quickly
 
01:21:55.610 --> 01:21:55.620 align:start position:0%
we need to get questions answered and I
 
01:21:57.350 --> 01:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
think that's what's happening and and
 
01:21:59.570 --> 01:21:59.580 align:start position:0%
Madam chair I would congratulate you on
 
01:22:02.270 --> 01:22:02.280 align:start position:0%
moving us through this process very
 
01:22:05.209 --> 01:22:05.219 align:start position:0%
rapidly uh but my patience has run out
 
01:22:10.250 --> 01:22:10.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:13.130 --> 01:22:13.140 align:start position:0%
president do you need do you need a uh
 
01:22:16.070 --> 01:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
if you're willing to entertain are you
 
01:22:18.410 --> 01:22:18.420 align:start position:0%
at the point and your deliberations and
 
01:22:19.550 --> 01:22:19.560 align:start position:0%
you're thinking that you're willing to
 
01:22:22.610 --> 01:22:22.620 align:start position:0%
entertain a motion to to uh take a vote
 
01:22:24.169 --> 01:22:24.179 align:start position:0%
of this committee to see if we want to
 
01:22:26.510 --> 01:22:26.520 align:start position:0%
continue the study and bring a forward a
 
01:22:29.570 --> 01:22:29.580 align:start position:0%
positive affirmation to the uh committee
 
01:22:33.169 --> 01:22:33.179 align:start position:0%
for the or or not or whatever well where
 
01:22:35.390 --> 01:22:35.400 align:start position:0%
where are we in that uh process I know
 
01:22:37.370 --> 01:22:37.380 align:start position:0%
you started with that's the culmination
 
01:22:39.229 --> 01:22:39.239 align:start position:0%
right right that we're ready to
 
01:22:41.470 --> 01:22:41.480 align:start position:0%
culminate well I had originally uh
 
01:22:43.790 --> 01:22:43.800 align:start position:0%
indicated that I thought today would be
 
01:22:46.850 --> 01:22:46.860 align:start position:0%
our last meeting day just because I felt
 
01:22:48.530 --> 01:22:48.540 align:start position:0%
like we had heard
 
01:22:51.709 --> 01:22:51.719 align:start position:0%
a lot of information from the public and
 
01:22:55.729 --> 01:22:55.739 align:start position:0%
uh and our our own agencies and that
 
01:22:58.070 --> 01:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
once we reviewed this
 
01:23:01.970 --> 01:23:01.980 align:start position:0%
well done uh research that we would make
 
01:23:04.130 --> 01:23:04.140 align:start position:0%
a decision so
 
01:23:06.110 --> 01:23:06.120 align:start position:0%
um I I don't know how individual members
 
01:23:07.970 --> 01:23:07.980 align:start position:0%
feel about making that determination
 
01:23:09.410 --> 01:23:09.420 align:start position:0%
today I certainly would want to hear
 
01:23:11.630 --> 01:23:11.640 align:start position:0%
from you okay possible for you to
 
01:23:14.630 --> 01:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
restate the the frame as you did we when
 
01:23:16.790 --> 01:23:16.800 align:start position:0%
we began a discussion today about what
 
01:23:19.250 --> 01:23:19.260 align:start position:0%
vote is needed for affirmative or
 
01:23:21.770 --> 01:23:21.780 align:start position:0%
negative for this I I am going to say it
 
01:23:24.350 --> 01:23:24.360 align:start position:0%
and then I'm going to ask uh that the
 
01:23:27.890 --> 01:23:27.900 align:start position:0%
man who knows more about how this works
 
01:23:30.790 --> 01:23:30.800 align:start position:0%
uh if I say anything that is
 
01:23:34.250 --> 01:23:34.260 align:start position:0%
untoward or out of line please let me
 
01:23:37.790 --> 01:23:37.800 align:start position:0%
know I believe that our charge today
 
01:23:41.450 --> 01:23:41.460 align:start position:0%
based on the fact that we are an interim
 
01:23:43.930 --> 01:23:43.940 align:start position:0%
study committee on house bill
 
01:23:49.669 --> 01:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
1229 which was a bill to establish a
 
01:23:52.550 --> 01:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
study committee on food service programs
 
01:23:55.669 --> 01:23:55.679 align:start position:0%
I believe that what the question we're
 
01:23:59.689 --> 01:23:59.699 align:start position:0%
answering is whether or not we feel that
 
01:24:02.530 --> 01:24:02.540 align:start position:0%
additional legislation
 
01:24:05.930 --> 01:24:05.940 align:start position:0%
related to House Bill 1229 is
 
01:24:08.930 --> 01:24:08.940 align:start position:0%
appropriate or not
 
01:24:11.689 --> 01:24:11.699 align:start position:0%
uh let me read the title of that bill
 
01:24:14.149 --> 01:24:14.159 align:start position:0%
because you're very close to what it
 
01:24:16.610 --> 01:24:16.620 align:start position:0%
said 1229 establishing a committee to
 
01:24:18.290 --> 01:24:18.300 align:start position:0%
study school meal programs in New
 
01:24:20.149 --> 01:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Public Schools and
 
01:24:22.430 --> 01:24:22.440 align:start position:0%
non-sectarian schools that accept public
 
01:24:25.970 --> 01:24:25.980 align:start position:0%
funds so as to establish a committee
 
01:24:29.810 --> 01:24:29.820 align:start position:0%
now what we had in the blurb on this was
 
01:24:31.430 --> 01:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
the education committee has been
 
01:24:33.350 --> 01:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
approached this year with several bills
 
01:24:35.750 --> 01:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
that request we study what food programs
 
01:24:38.030 --> 01:24:38.040 align:start position:0%
schools are using and what programs are
 
01:24:40.189 --> 01:24:40.199 align:start position:0%
not working we have been approached with
 
01:24:42.169 --> 01:24:42.179 align:start position:0%
bills that want to explore how Granite
 
01:24:44.149 --> 01:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
State students can take advantage of our
 
01:24:46.729 --> 01:24:46.739 align:start position:0%
natural resources in the Farms that will
 
01:24:48.950 --> 01:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
benefit the students nutritionally and
 
01:24:51.290 --> 01:24:51.300 align:start position:0%
our Farmers financially some questions
 
01:24:54.110 --> 01:24:54.120 align:start position:0%
revolve around whether local resources
 
01:24:56.390 --> 01:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
can alleviate supply chain issues and
 
01:24:57.770 --> 01:24:57.780 align:start position:0%
whether we can rely on them
 
01:25:00.410 --> 01:25:00.420 align:start position:0%
systematically for these reasons more we
 
01:25:02.090 --> 01:25:02.100 align:start position:0%
need to decide on a preliminary
 
01:25:04.610 --> 01:25:04.620 align:start position:0%
structure of how to study these topics
 
01:25:06.950 --> 01:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
uh my my
 
01:25:08.630 --> 01:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
understanding of where we are in
 
01:25:11.090 --> 01:25:11.100 align:start position:0%
commissions and committees that we have
 
01:25:13.189 --> 01:25:13.199 align:start position:0%
enough commissions and committees I
 
01:25:14.870 --> 01:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
think it's time to say
 
01:25:17.270 --> 01:25:17.280 align:start position:0%
we feel that there's no need to kick
 
01:25:19.070 --> 01:25:19.080 align:start position:0%
this can down the road further that
 
01:25:21.649 --> 01:25:21.659 align:start position:0%
there's no need for additional study or
 
01:25:23.750 --> 01:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
a committee we need to bring forward
 
01:25:25.850 --> 01:25:25.860 align:start position:0%
legislation of some kind to address the
 
01:25:29.810 --> 01:25:29.820 align:start position:0%
issue of uh hunger in schools and and so
 
01:25:31.970 --> 01:25:31.980 align:start position:0%
um and with some Snippets that you've
 
01:25:34.070 --> 01:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
taken from your committee here
 
01:25:36.709 --> 01:25:36.719 align:start position:0%
um so basically there's no need for this
 
01:25:38.750 --> 01:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
bill to go forward this bill is a
 
01:25:42.229 --> 01:25:42.239 align:start position:0%
committee study we've just done that and
 
01:25:42.239 --> 01:25:43.370 align:start position:0%
committee study we've just done that and
and

01:25:43.370 --> 01:25:43.380 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:25:46.189 --> 01:25:46.199 align:start position:0%
um we've studied a lot of this over the
 
01:25:48.050 --> 01:25:48.060 align:start position:0%
years and we have doe here that's able
 
01:25:49.250 --> 01:25:49.260 align:start position:0%
to provide the information we have
 
01:25:52.669 --> 01:25:52.679 align:start position:0%
research assistant Gen4 here also
 
01:25:54.830 --> 01:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
um I think you're at the point where you
 
01:25:56.410 --> 01:25:56.420 align:start position:0%
want to bring some legislation forward
 
01:25:58.669 --> 01:25:58.679 align:start position:0%
based upon some of the discussions
 
01:26:00.169 --> 01:26:00.179 align:start position:0%
you've had be it with West Virginia
 
01:26:02.990 --> 01:26:03.000 align:start position:0%
Virginia Maine Delaware Etc
 
01:26:05.209 --> 01:26:05.219 align:start position:0%
so the answer to the question would be
 
01:26:09.649 --> 01:26:09.659 align:start position:0%
no we do not need additional study
 
01:26:13.610 --> 01:26:13.620 align:start position:0%
we feel that additional legislation is
 
01:26:15.649 --> 01:26:15.659 align:start position:0%
warranted in
 
01:26:18.350 --> 01:26:18.360 align:start position:0%
the following areas the purpose of the
 
01:26:21.530 --> 01:26:21.540 align:start position:0%
study has been met by this subcommittee
 
01:26:24.229 --> 01:26:24.239 align:start position:0%
now we feel now take that next step
 
01:26:26.390 --> 01:26:26.400 align:start position:0%
forward with
 
01:26:28.729 --> 01:26:28.739 align:start position:0%
creative legislation that's going to you
 
01:26:28.739 --> 01:26:29.450 align:start position:0%
creative legislation that's going to you
know

01:26:29.450 --> 01:26:29.460 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:26:31.550 --> 01:26:31.560 align:start position:0%
meet some of these these goals in which
 
01:26:32.930 --> 01:26:32.940 align:start position:0%
we have so you ought to come up with
 
01:26:34.490 --> 01:26:34.500 align:start position:0%
some general aspirations that this
 
01:26:37.250 --> 01:26:37.260 align:start position:0%
committee really wants to see yeah
 
01:26:40.490 --> 01:26:40.500 align:start position:0%
um and so that that should be spoken to
 
01:26:42.530 --> 01:26:42.540 align:start position:0%
you know if you're going to take that
 
01:26:45.350 --> 01:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
vein then you want to really try to
 
01:26:47.930 --> 01:26:47.940 align:start position:0%
speak a little bit too so
 
01:26:49.970 --> 01:26:49.980 align:start position:0%
you don't have to
 
01:26:51.649 --> 01:26:51.659 align:start position:0%
um it could be just brought forward it'd
 
01:26:53.030 --> 01:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
be nice to keep it all on the same page
 
01:26:54.709 --> 01:26:54.719 align:start position:0%
though yeah the only thing I'm thinking
 
01:26:57.410 --> 01:26:57.420 align:start position:0%
about is whether or not that can be done
 
01:26:57.420 --> 01:26:59.709 align:start position:0%
about is whether or not that can be done
uh

01:26:59.709 --> 01:26:59.719 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:27:01.910 --> 01:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
whether or not I can put something
 
01:27:05.689 --> 01:27:05.699 align:start position:0%
together and uh
 
01:27:07.550 --> 01:27:07.560 align:start position:0%
circulate it or whether or not we have
 
01:27:09.290 --> 01:27:09.300 align:start position:0%
to have another meeting
 
01:27:11.930 --> 01:27:11.940 align:start position:0%
you could always you know put together
 
01:27:14.390 --> 01:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
some bullets or what what whatever right
 
01:27:17.990 --> 01:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
now and or in in a interim period here
 
01:27:21.350 --> 01:27:21.360 align:start position:0%
we have till the 24th you could meet
 
01:27:24.169 --> 01:27:24.179 align:start position:0%
early just before the committee of the
 
01:27:26.990 --> 01:27:27.000 align:start position:0%
whole meets to take executing these
 
01:27:30.169 --> 01:27:30.179 align:start position:0%
bills and possibly look at that
 
01:27:32.930 --> 01:27:32.940 align:start position:0%
distribute this by way of you know email
 
01:27:36.470 --> 01:27:36.480 align:start position:0%
to everybody and then come back in and
 
01:27:38.390 --> 01:27:38.400 align:start position:0%
ask people that if any comments on one
 
01:27:40.070 --> 01:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
just strike it and modify it a little
 
01:27:42.169 --> 01:27:42.179 align:start position:0%
bit of whatever yeah uh then try to come
 
01:27:43.610 --> 01:27:43.620 align:start position:0%
in and get that I don't think there's
 
01:27:47.149 --> 01:27:47.159 align:start position:0%
need for any more study on this thing
 
01:27:49.550 --> 01:27:49.560 align:start position:0%
all right then I will be looking for a
 
01:27:51.910 --> 01:27:51.920 align:start position:0%
motion from somebody
 
01:27:57.530 --> 01:27:57.540 align:start position:0%
to uh I'm looking for emotion made that
 
01:28:01.490 --> 01:28:01.500 align:start position:0%
there is uh no further need for
 
01:28:04.669 --> 01:28:04.679 align:start position:0%
additional study
 
01:28:08.930 --> 01:28:08.940 align:start position:0%
and uh the following recommendations are
 
01:28:12.590 --> 01:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:13.970 --> 01:28:13.980 align:start position:0%
I think we'll tell you Allison who's
 
01:28:16.010 --> 01:28:16.020 align:start position:0%
making that motion actually
 
01:28:19.070 --> 01:28:19.080 align:start position:0%
no I think I I think uh representative
 
01:28:22.490 --> 01:28:22.500 align:start position:0%
lekkas beat him to it so so you are
 
01:28:27.590 --> 01:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
making the motion I make I move that we
 
01:28:32.290 --> 01:28:32.300 align:start position:0%
recommend that a uh we there is no need
 
01:28:35.930 --> 01:28:35.940 align:start position:0%
for a study committee that the work has
 
01:28:37.790 --> 01:28:37.800 align:start position:0%
been done already
 
01:28:41.330 --> 01:28:41.340 align:start position:0%
during our interim study and that
 
01:28:45.110 --> 01:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
instead we recommend that legislation be
 
01:28:48.410 --> 01:28:48.420 align:start position:0%
put forward in the following areas
 
01:28:50.870 --> 01:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
to be filled out and agreed upon during
 
01:28:52.850 --> 01:28:52.860 align:start position:0%
the next week or two
 
01:28:55.550 --> 01:28:55.560 align:start position:0%
okay do I have a second
 
01:28:58.910 --> 01:28:58.920 align:start position:0%
uh representative Ellison you second the
 
01:28:58.920 --> 01:28:59.990 align:start position:0%
uh representative Ellison you second the
motion

01:28:59.990 --> 01:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
motion
 
01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.149 align:start position:0%
motion
okay

01:29:02.149 --> 01:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:29:07.370 --> 01:29:07.380 align:start position:0%
so with that in mind then I will ask for
 
01:29:10.010 --> 01:29:10.020 align:start position:0%
a vote on the motion
 
01:29:12.470 --> 01:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
and I'm just going to go from right to
 
01:29:16.510 --> 01:29:16.520 align:start position:0%
left representative Woodcock yes
 
01:29:20.290 --> 01:29:20.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:23.950 --> 01:29:23.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:27.890 --> 01:29:27.900 align:start position:0%
representative lekkis yes
 
01:29:32.149 --> 01:29:32.159 align:start position:0%
and I am also a voting member and I am a
 
01:29:35.570 --> 01:29:35.580 align:start position:0%
yes no uh chairman Ladd is not a member
 
01:29:40.270 --> 01:29:40.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:40.280 --> 01:29:41.810 align:start position:0%
 
thanks

01:29:41.810 --> 01:29:41.820 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
01:29:45.229 --> 01:29:45.239 align:start position:0%
yeah so so the motion passes anyhow yes
 
01:29:47.810 --> 01:29:47.820 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to pass on one piece of
 
01:29:50.330 --> 01:29:50.340 align:start position:0%
information I got since our last meeting
 
01:29:53.810 --> 01:29:53.820 align:start position:0%
about the farm to school program when I
 
01:29:55.729 --> 01:29:55.739 align:start position:0%
was last buying my vegetables at our
 
01:29:58.070 --> 01:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
local Farm Stand I mentioned that we
 
01:29:59.870 --> 01:29:59.880 align:start position:0%
were working on that and he said and he
 
01:30:01.729 --> 01:30:01.739 align:start position:0%
just almost shouted it that won't work
 
01:30:03.649 --> 01:30:03.659 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and I was kind of taken
 
01:30:05.990 --> 01:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
back I'm like what he said Alvernon
 
01:30:08.030 --> 01:30:08.040 align:start position:0%
Alvern approached them years ago and
 
01:30:09.770 --> 01:30:09.780 align:start position:0%
they spent about three years trying to
 
01:30:11.689 --> 01:30:11.699 align:start position:0%
figure out how to make it work he said
 
01:30:15.050 --> 01:30:15.060 align:start position:0%
the problem is we're about done with our
 
01:30:17.930 --> 01:30:17.940 align:start position:0%
Harvest about the time school starts and
 
01:30:19.850 --> 01:30:19.860 align:start position:0%
so maybe they can provide things for
 
01:30:23.030 --> 01:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
September October and that's it and so
 
01:30:25.129 --> 01:30:25.139 align:start position:0%
he's and they did what he said we worked
 
01:30:27.050 --> 01:30:27.060 align:start position:0%
really hard for like three or four years
 
01:30:29.810 --> 01:30:29.820 align:start position:0%
trying to make it work and that's in the
 
01:30:31.370 --> 01:30:31.380 align:start position:0%
southern part of the south central part
 
01:30:32.990 --> 01:30:33.000 align:start position:0%
of the state where the weather is a
 
01:30:34.669 --> 01:30:34.679 align:start position:0%
little better than up north
 
01:30:37.490 --> 01:30:37.500 align:start position:0%
and I know other Farms that I know of in
 
01:30:39.530 --> 01:30:39.540 align:start position:0%
the state they're pretty much in the
 
01:30:41.990 --> 01:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
same I mean you have meat farms that
 
01:30:44.689 --> 01:30:44.699 align:start position:0%
could provide meat for freezers or
 
01:30:44.699 --> 01:30:46.129 align:start position:0%
could provide meat for freezers or
whatever

01:30:46.129 --> 01:30:46.139 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
01:30:49.010 --> 01:30:49.020 align:start position:0%
but yeah the squash is about the end of
 
01:30:50.330 --> 01:30:50.340 align:start position:0%
the season
 
01:30:52.090 --> 01:30:52.100 align:start position:0%
squash and apples
 
01:30:54.229 --> 01:30:54.239 align:start position:0%
representative Paul
 
01:30:57.770 --> 01:30:57.780 align:start position:0%
I would say we grew potatoes up north
 
01:31:00.110 --> 01:31:00.120 align:start position:0%
and they were year round we had them
 
01:31:01.790 --> 01:31:01.800 align:start position:0%
right in our basement and we sold them
 
01:31:04.010 --> 01:31:04.020 align:start position:0%
to the school year round so there are
 
01:31:06.890 --> 01:31:06.900 align:start position:0%
some products that are year-round
 
01:31:10.070 --> 01:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
and representative Allison and I would
 
01:31:11.810 --> 01:31:11.820 align:start position:0%
suggest apples may fall into that
 
01:31:14.950 --> 01:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
category correct yeah add those carrots
 
01:31:16.850 --> 01:31:16.860 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock did you have
 
01:31:18.410 --> 01:31:18.420 align:start position:0%
something I got two things why not add
 
01:31:19.850 --> 01:31:19.860 align:start position:0%
carrots to that are they still buy them
 
01:31:21.590 --> 01:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
from our local Farm in January February
 
01:31:21.600 --> 01:31:22.850 align:start position:0%
from our local Farm in January February
March

01:31:22.850 --> 01:31:22.860 align:start position:0%
March
 
01:31:24.890 --> 01:31:24.900 align:start position:0%
um but in all seriousness representative
 
01:31:26.390 --> 01:31:26.400 align:start position:0%
I want to thank you
 
01:31:28.129 --> 01:31:28.139 align:start position:0%
um for the diligence that you put in
 
01:31:29.570 --> 01:31:29.580 align:start position:0%
this committee to make sure we all have
 
01:31:30.709 --> 01:31:30.719 align:start position:0%
the information we needed and Jennifer
 
01:31:32.450 --> 01:31:32.460 align:start position:0%
for her work
 
01:31:34.189 --> 01:31:34.199 align:start position:0%
um this has been a pleasure to serve on
 
01:31:36.229 --> 01:31:36.239 align:start position:0%
this with you and I appreciate your
 
01:31:38.030 --> 01:31:38.040 align:start position:0%
leadership well thank you very much I
 
01:31:41.149 --> 01:31:41.159 align:start position:0%
appreciate your comments uh it's as I
 
01:31:43.010 --> 01:31:43.020 align:start position:0%
said near and near and dear to my heart
 
01:31:45.350 --> 01:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
Uh Hungry kids
 
01:31:47.330 --> 01:31:47.340 align:start position:0%
we've got work to do
 
01:31:49.790 --> 01:31:49.800 align:start position:0%
don't give up on the locally grown stuff
 
01:31:51.950 --> 01:31:51.960 align:start position:0%
either up in Grafton County we have a
 
01:31:54.709 --> 01:31:54.719 align:start position:0%
Grafton County Farm which provides the
 
01:31:56.810 --> 01:31:56.820 align:start position:0%
produce for the Grafton County Nursing
 
01:32:00.530 --> 01:32:00.540 align:start position:0%
Home and it offsets the costs of food in
 
01:32:03.950 --> 01:32:03.960 align:start position:0%
that particular County operation we also
 
01:32:06.950 --> 01:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
have the food pantry in Woodsville which
 
01:32:10.970 --> 01:32:10.980 align:start position:0%
we get donations from local stores be it
 
01:32:12.890 --> 01:32:12.900 align:start position:0%
Shaw's or Hannaford and that's
 
01:32:14.629 --> 01:32:14.639 align:start position:0%
distributed to those that are in need
 
01:32:16.250 --> 01:32:16.260 align:start position:0%
within the community not to the schools
 
01:32:18.169 --> 01:32:18.179 align:start position:0%
but there's no reason why programs like
 
01:32:21.530 --> 01:32:21.540 align:start position:0%
this can't be also helping schools if we
 
01:32:24.830 --> 01:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
look at the season and we look at you
 
01:32:26.510 --> 01:32:26.520 align:start position:0%
know what the availability of what
 
01:32:30.950 --> 01:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
produce or crop is there but there are a
 
01:32:33.129 --> 01:32:33.139 align:start position:0%
number of small locally operated
 
01:32:35.149 --> 01:32:35.159 align:start position:0%
operations here in the state I know the
 
01:32:36.950 --> 01:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
commissioner came here represent Jasper
 
01:32:38.570 --> 01:32:38.580 align:start position:0%
and he said well sustainability is a
 
01:32:39.950 --> 01:32:39.960 align:start position:0%
major issue that you speak to
 
01:32:43.370 --> 01:32:43.380 align:start position:0%
representative Lakers and I agree but I
 
01:32:45.350 --> 01:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
wouldn't say that's enough rationale to
 
01:32:48.110 --> 01:32:48.120 align:start position:0%
stop and not really pursue right
 
01:32:50.870 --> 01:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
continue to pursue it yeah thank you
 
01:32:50.880 --> 01:32:52.490 align:start position:0%
continue to pursue it yeah thank you
yeah

01:32:52.490 --> 01:32:52.500 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:32:54.350 --> 01:32:54.360 align:start position:0%
um I am interested before you all go
 
01:32:56.330 --> 01:32:56.340 align:start position:0%
dashing out the door if you would like
 
01:32:58.010 --> 01:32:58.020 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
01:33:00.669 --> 01:33:00.679 align:start position:0%
speak to me about
 
01:33:02.930 --> 01:33:02.940 align:start position:0%
what sort of recommendations you would
 
01:33:04.610 --> 01:33:04.620 align:start position:0%
like to go into this report we can do
 
01:33:06.470 --> 01:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
one of two things we can I can either
 
01:33:08.510 --> 01:33:08.520 align:start position:0%
take your suggestions now we can
 
01:33:13.310 --> 01:33:13.320 align:start position:0%
continue to meet or you can email me uh
 
01:33:15.970 --> 01:33:15.980 align:start position:0%
have having digested this information
 
01:33:19.129 --> 01:33:19.139 align:start position:0%
but I would ask that you email me within
 
01:33:21.770 --> 01:33:21.780 align:start position:0%
the next couple of days or so so that I
 
01:33:24.350 --> 01:33:24.360 align:start position:0%
can get this done with any
 
01:33:26.810 --> 01:33:26.820 align:start position:0%
recommendations that resonated with you
 
01:33:30.590 --> 01:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
from all of our discussions and I will
 
01:33:32.450 --> 01:33:32.460 align:start position:0%
try to put something together yes
 
01:33:34.669 --> 01:33:34.679 align:start position:0%
representative Hall I just wonder about
 
01:33:37.010 --> 01:33:37.020 align:start position:0%
how we can capture these folks that
 
01:33:37.020 --> 01:33:38.030 align:start position:0%
how we can capture these folks that
aren't

01:33:38.030 --> 01:33:38.040 align:start position:0%
aren't
 
01:33:40.310 --> 01:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
on the record as being free and reduced
 
01:33:42.290 --> 01:33:42.300 align:start position:0%
but they really are and so that for me
 
01:33:44.330 --> 01:33:44.340 align:start position:0%
is like how do we yeah how do we get
 
01:33:46.490 --> 01:33:46.500 align:start position:0%
those folks because I think we used to
 
01:33:48.649 --> 01:33:48.659 align:start position:0%
refer to those as the fourth stay nine
 
01:33:51.290 --> 01:33:51.300 align:start position:0%
kids when I was in school that if you
 
01:33:53.930 --> 01:33:53.940 align:start position:0%
were in one two and three you got loads
 
01:33:55.970 --> 01:33:55.980 align:start position:0%
of services and if you were gifted and
 
01:33:58.970 --> 01:33:58.980 align:start position:0%
talented you got services but yeah if
 
01:34:02.390 --> 01:34:02.400 align:start position:0%
you're slightly above that eligibility
 
01:34:07.790 --> 01:34:07.800 align:start position:0%
criteria or if you're eligible but you
 
01:34:09.890 --> 01:34:09.900 align:start position:0%
don't have your family doesn't have the
 
01:34:12.709 --> 01:34:12.719 align:start position:0%
wherewithal to know how to apply or when
 
01:34:15.890 --> 01:34:15.900 align:start position:0%
to apply or yeah that would go beyond
 
01:34:17.810 --> 01:34:17.820 align:start position:0%
that so I'm talking about the ones that
 
01:34:20.510 --> 01:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
are do would certainly qualify I know
 
01:34:23.390 --> 01:34:23.400 align:start position:0%
for myself personally I the cafeteria
 
01:34:25.970 --> 01:34:25.980 align:start position:0%
woman when I would go to Lexington I
 
01:34:27.590 --> 01:34:27.600 align:start position:0%
don't know why your parents don't with
 
01:34:31.750 --> 01:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:34.010 --> 01:34:34.020 align:start position:0%
uh sure you know
 
01:34:35.570 --> 01:34:35.580 align:start position:0%
um and following up what representative
 
01:34:43.030 --> 01:34:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:46.370 --> 01:34:46.380 align:start position:0%
I just uh representative Vlad I want to
 
01:34:47.750 --> 01:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
give representative Paul an opportunity
 
01:34:50.930 --> 01:34:50.940 align:start position:0%
to finish okay so so it was why aren't
 
01:34:52.490 --> 01:34:52.500 align:start position:0%
you and it wasn't they didn't have the
 
01:34:52.500 --> 01:34:53.629 align:start position:0%
you and it wasn't they didn't have the
wherewithal

01:34:53.629 --> 01:34:53.639 align:start position:0%
wherewithal
 
01:34:56.629 --> 01:34:56.639 align:start position:0%
it was just they chose not to the the
 
01:34:59.090 --> 01:34:59.100 align:start position:0%
pride and whatnot and so I think that
 
01:35:01.430 --> 01:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
there are people
 
01:35:04.370 --> 01:35:04.380 align:start position:0%
um in that category I'm guessing
 
01:35:06.169 --> 01:35:06.179 align:start position:0%
so how do we catch that so when I was a
 
01:35:06.179 --> 01:35:07.129 align:start position:0%
so how do we catch that so when I was a
principal

01:35:07.129 --> 01:35:07.139 align:start position:0%
principal
 
01:35:09.530 --> 01:35:09.540 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure our reps in whitcock you've
 
01:35:11.450 --> 01:35:11.460 align:start position:0%
done the same thing
 
01:35:13.310 --> 01:35:13.320 align:start position:0%
um you knew that there were some kids
 
01:35:14.810 --> 01:35:14.820 align:start position:0%
which were eligible that were not
 
01:35:17.930 --> 01:35:17.940 align:start position:0%
bringing this into school for a either
 
01:35:19.490 --> 01:35:19.500 align:start position:0%
the upper levels of middle school or
 
01:35:23.090 --> 01:35:23.100 align:start position:0%
high school but we checked them off as
 
01:35:26.209 --> 01:35:26.219 align:start position:0%
receiving that we we used our ability to
 
01:35:27.709 --> 01:35:27.719 align:start position:0%
make an exception
 
01:35:30.770 --> 01:35:30.780 align:start position:0%
by allowing the student to qualify we
 
01:35:33.290 --> 01:35:33.300 align:start position:0%
qualify them the administrators all the
 
01:35:34.930 --> 01:35:34.940 align:start position:0%
principals in the district got together
 
01:35:37.129 --> 01:35:37.139 align:start position:0%
and we went through all these
 
01:35:39.770 --> 01:35:39.780 align:start position:0%
applications every October
 
01:35:42.470 --> 01:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
um so is that something that's done
 
01:35:47.090 --> 01:35:47.100 align:start position:0%
still today is it legal or what
 
01:35:47.100 --> 01:35:48.129 align:start position:0%
still today is it legal or what
um

01:35:48.129 --> 01:35:48.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:51.350 --> 01:35:51.360 align:start position:0%
that is not done today
 
01:35:55.370 --> 01:35:55.380 align:start position:0%
um there are certain circumstances
 
01:35:56.750 --> 01:35:56.760 align:start position:0%
um that
 
01:35:59.450 --> 01:35:59.460 align:start position:0%
it could be
 
01:36:03.830 --> 01:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
um depending upon the situation
 
01:36:06.050 --> 01:36:06.060 align:start position:0%
um but in the way that you're describing
 
01:36:07.790 --> 01:36:07.800 align:start position:0%
it it
 
01:36:09.770 --> 01:36:09.780 align:start position:0%
um would not happen
 
01:36:13.250 --> 01:36:13.260 align:start position:0%
um in that way so if we had a an
 
01:36:16.430 --> 01:36:16.440 align:start position:0%
application from Susan Jones down in the
 
01:36:19.250 --> 01:36:19.260 align:start position:0%
sixth grade and the parent said you know
 
01:36:22.189 --> 01:36:22.199 align:start position:0%
we also have Johnny and Ralph and etc
 
01:36:24.649 --> 01:36:24.659 align:start position:0%
etc in our family and the other grades
 
01:36:26.689 --> 01:36:26.699 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't suffice
 
01:36:29.270 --> 01:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
no that's a different situation
 
01:36:32.030 --> 01:36:32.040 align:start position:0%
um so the families now only have to fill
 
01:36:34.070 --> 01:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
out one application they can include
 
01:36:37.250 --> 01:36:37.260 align:start position:0%
everybody on that application
 
01:36:39.950 --> 01:36:39.960 align:start position:0%
um so they would be all encumbrance of
 
01:36:41.990 --> 01:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
whoever is in the household
 
01:36:44.570 --> 01:36:44.580 align:start position:0%
um and it's a local level
 
01:36:47.090 --> 01:36:47.100 align:start position:0%
um at the Department of Education we
 
01:36:48.649 --> 01:36:48.659 align:start position:0%
don't have anything to do with that
 
01:36:51.110 --> 01:36:51.120 align:start position:0%
determine determination and eligibility
 
01:36:55.370 --> 01:36:55.380 align:start position:0%
that's done at a local level so it's in
 
01:36:58.550 --> 01:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
fact the nutrition directors that are
 
01:37:01.970 --> 01:37:01.980 align:start position:0%
the ones that are doing that again due
 
01:37:05.030 --> 01:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
to you know data privacy and and privacy
 
01:37:07.010 --> 01:37:07.020 align:start position:0%
of those people that fill out those
 
01:37:08.689 --> 01:37:08.699 align:start position:0%
applications that's something that's
 
01:37:11.930 --> 01:37:11.940 align:start position:0%
very um taken very seriously is this a
 
01:37:14.090 --> 01:37:14.100 align:start position:0%
state application no it's a USDA
 
01:37:15.830 --> 01:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
application it's USD does on that
 
01:37:18.050 --> 01:37:18.060 align:start position:0%
application does it say please fill out
 
01:37:21.290 --> 01:37:21.300 align:start position:0%
all children within your family on that
 
01:37:24.110 --> 01:37:24.120 align:start position:0%
individual application or to say State
 
01:37:27.050 --> 01:37:27.060 align:start position:0%
the it's coming from elementary to
 
01:37:29.270 --> 01:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
school X so you're filling out as a
 
01:37:30.770 --> 01:37:30.780 align:start position:0%
parent the kids which are attending
 
01:37:33.709 --> 01:37:33.719 align:start position:0%
Elementary X school not including your
 
01:37:36.290 --> 01:37:36.300 align:start position:0%
other children in the instructions it
 
01:37:40.370 --> 01:37:40.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:43.669 --> 01:37:43.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:46.370 --> 01:37:46.380 align:start position:0%
um just to finish that's just part of
 
01:37:48.530 --> 01:37:48.540 align:start position:0%
um the packet that goes to every single
 
01:37:50.689 --> 01:37:50.699 align:start position:0%
student at the beginning of every single
 
01:37:52.250 --> 01:37:52.260 align:start position:0%
school year that's a required that's a
 
01:37:54.709 --> 01:37:54.719 align:start position:0%
USDA requirement printed out and handed
 
01:37:57.290 --> 01:37:57.300 align:start position:0%
to every single student
 
01:38:00.350 --> 01:38:00.360 align:start position:0%
representative Ladd if we had an office
 
01:38:02.030 --> 01:38:02.040 align:start position:0%
of School counseling at the Department
 
01:38:04.129 --> 01:38:04.139 align:start position:0%
of Education
 
01:38:06.470 --> 01:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
that person would be able to tell you
 
01:38:10.930 --> 01:38:10.940 align:start position:0%
that it is a school counselor's purview
 
01:38:14.270 --> 01:38:14.280 align:start position:0%
to reach out to families to be in touch
 
01:38:17.209 --> 01:38:17.219 align:start position:0%
with families to uh and or a school
 
01:38:20.450 --> 01:38:20.460 align:start position:0%
social worker if they're in existence I
 
01:38:22.970 --> 01:38:22.980 align:start position:0%
I would agree but I also agree as a
 
01:38:25.790 --> 01:38:25.800 align:start position:0%
principal and an assistant principal in
 
01:38:28.070 --> 01:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
your building we laid it on ourselves to
 
01:38:29.930 --> 01:38:29.940 align:start position:0%
get that done and didn't have to be
 
01:38:31.729 --> 01:38:31.739 align:start position:0%
necessarily the counselor or it could be
 
01:38:33.290 --> 01:38:33.300 align:start position:0%
anybody in the administration doing it
 
01:38:35.810 --> 01:38:35.820 align:start position:0%
and we did make those contacts but it
 
01:38:37.610 --> 01:38:37.620 align:start position:0%
would be nice if they in instead of
 
01:38:39.970 --> 01:38:39.980 align:start position:0%
saying just house all household members
 
01:38:42.790 --> 01:38:42.800 align:start position:0%
including children yeah
 
01:38:45.530 --> 01:38:45.540 align:start position:0%
I also think too that you know the
 
01:38:48.790 --> 01:38:48.800 align:start position:0%
stigma and shame of of hunger
 
01:38:52.970 --> 01:38:52.980 align:start position:0%
is huge it is huge we I know staff
 
01:38:56.149 --> 01:38:56.159 align:start position:0%
members in buildings that are hesitant
 
01:38:58.189 --> 01:38:58.199 align:start position:0%
to address
 
01:39:01.430 --> 01:39:01.440 align:start position:0%
a family a parent you know they've got
 
01:39:03.709 --> 01:39:03.719 align:start position:0%
kids in their classrooms that are hungry
 
01:39:06.890 --> 01:39:06.900 align:start position:0%
and they're hesitant because they don't
 
01:39:08.510 --> 01:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
want to make the parent feel
 
01:39:12.050 --> 01:39:12.060 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable or have the parent think
 
01:39:13.910 --> 01:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
that somehow or another there's judgment
 
01:39:18.229 --> 01:39:18.239 align:start position:0%
involved but uh but no kid you know no
 
01:39:21.290 --> 01:39:21.300 align:start position:0%
family no child should feel shame over
 
01:39:23.750 --> 01:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
Hunger yes representative Woodcock thank
 
01:39:25.330 --> 01:39:25.340 align:start position:0%
you um
 
01:39:28.970 --> 01:39:28.980 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm I
 
01:39:31.850 --> 01:39:31.860 align:start position:0%
I was under the misnomer when we were
 
01:39:33.709 --> 01:39:33.719 align:start position:0%
talking with representative Ladd's uh
 
01:39:35.510 --> 01:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
other committee about Medicaid and
 
01:39:38.030 --> 01:39:38.040 align:start position:0%
helping that the large applications a
 
01:39:40.129 --> 01:39:40.139 align:start position:0%
lot of youngsters are included I was
 
01:39:41.450 --> 01:39:41.460 align:start position:0%
still thinking that we were losing
 
01:39:43.010 --> 01:39:43.020 align:start position:0%
youngsters in the upper levels because
 
01:39:45.110 --> 01:39:45.120 align:start position:0%
they weren't included can you tell me
 
01:39:47.149 --> 01:39:47.159 align:start position:0%
what year we changed that I mean I'm I
 
01:39:48.950 --> 01:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
was really on the wrong information that
 
01:39:50.390 --> 01:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
all youngsters were included under one
 
01:39:50.400 --> 01:39:51.590 align:start position:0%
all youngsters were included under one
application

01:39:51.590 --> 01:39:51.600 align:start position:0%
application
 
01:39:54.050 --> 01:39:54.060 align:start position:0%
as far as I as long as I have been in
 
01:39:55.850 --> 01:39:55.860 align:start position:0%
Child Nutrition which will this will be
 
01:39:58.430 --> 01:39:58.440 align:start position:0%
my 11th year they have always been on
 
01:40:00.470 --> 01:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
the application wow um and they're
 
01:40:03.830 --> 01:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
they're approved on one application yes
 
01:40:06.110 --> 01:40:06.120 align:start position:0%
the family can fill out one application
 
01:40:09.050 --> 01:40:09.060 align:start position:0%
right um so I had that misinformation on
 
01:40:11.149 --> 01:40:11.159 align:start position:0%
my brain thank you no terrific um and
 
01:40:12.530 --> 01:40:12.540 align:start position:0%
the local level
 
01:40:14.330 --> 01:40:14.340 align:start position:0%
um you know it's a best practice and
 
01:40:16.729 --> 01:40:16.739 align:start position:0%
that they they make that connection and
 
01:40:18.830 --> 01:40:18.840 align:start position:0%
look in their system to make sure that
 
01:40:20.750 --> 01:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
they're connecting
 
01:40:22.970 --> 01:40:22.980 align:start position:0%
um those two together and and the way
 
01:40:24.830 --> 01:40:24.840 align:start position:0%
the application
 
01:40:27.770 --> 01:40:27.780 align:start position:0%
um is separated out students are at the
 
01:40:30.649 --> 01:40:30.659 align:start position:0%
top you can identify what school they're
 
01:40:30.659 --> 01:40:31.910 align:start position:0%
top you can identify what school they're
at

01:40:31.910 --> 01:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:40:32.930 --> 01:40:32.940 align:start position:0%
um and there's there's different
 
01:40:35.090 --> 01:40:35.100 align:start position:0%
criteria in that and that's when the
 
01:40:36.830 --> 01:40:36.840 align:start position:0%
bottom is when where the parents are
 
01:40:39.590 --> 01:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
parents Guardians um
 
01:40:42.770 --> 01:40:42.780 align:start position:0%
they're identifying follow up to that so
 
01:40:44.570 --> 01:40:44.580 align:start position:0%
when a student is attending Woodsville
 
01:40:47.870 --> 01:40:47.880 align:start position:0%
High School who is from Bath
 
01:40:49.370 --> 01:40:49.380 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire
 
01:40:52.010 --> 01:40:52.020 align:start position:0%
uh that's a separate School District
 
01:40:54.830 --> 01:40:54.840 align:start position:0%
within the co uh within the school
 
01:40:56.510 --> 01:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
administrative district and school
 
01:41:00.229 --> 01:41:00.239 align:start position:0%
administrative Union and does bath then
 
01:41:02.870 --> 01:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
contact Woodsville High School
 
01:41:06.890 --> 01:41:06.900 align:start position:0%
or the central office for SAU 23 that
 
01:41:09.649 --> 01:41:09.659 align:start position:0%
this kid in bath
 
01:41:11.990 --> 01:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
along with those other students which
 
01:41:13.669 --> 01:41:13.679 align:start position:0%
are attending your high school there in
 
01:41:16.370 --> 01:41:16.380 align:start position:0%
Woodsville are eligible or or is that
 
01:41:18.410 --> 01:41:18.420 align:start position:0%
something that's just kept that path and
 
01:41:21.229 --> 01:41:21.239 align:start position:0%
we miss out on that child that's maybe
 
01:41:23.510 --> 01:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
attending the older one that's attending
 
01:41:26.149 --> 01:41:26.159 align:start position:0%
the high school that's on the that other
 
01:41:28.370 --> 01:41:28.380 align:start position:0%
application comes in a bath
 
01:41:30.910 --> 01:41:30.920 align:start position:0%
I can't speak particularly to that
 
01:41:33.770 --> 01:41:33.780 align:start position:0%
situation I'd have to look at the SAU to
 
01:41:37.609 --> 01:41:37.619 align:start position:0%
find out the makeup of do they have one
 
01:41:39.830 --> 01:41:39.840 align:start position:0%
nutrition director do they
 
01:41:41.930 --> 01:41:41.940 align:start position:0%
um I would like to say I'm fluent in all
 
01:41:45.169 --> 01:41:45.179 align:start position:0%
of the saus but in my 10 months director
 
01:41:49.490 --> 01:41:49.500 align:start position:0%
right there in North Haverhill okay and
 
01:41:52.370 --> 01:41:52.380 align:start position:0%
so it's it and she has quite a burden
 
01:41:53.990 --> 01:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
trying to collect money that's owed to
 
01:41:57.169 --> 01:41:57.179 align:start position:0%
them and on and on it goes but I'm I'm
 
01:41:59.390 --> 01:41:59.400 align:start position:0%
just hoping we're counting all the kids
 
01:42:01.370 --> 01:42:01.380 align:start position:0%
and even from those sending communities
 
01:42:03.770 --> 01:42:03.780 align:start position:0%
like Benton and bath and Warren and
 
01:42:06.169 --> 01:42:06.179 align:start position:0%
Piermont all those communities we want
 
01:42:08.270 --> 01:42:08.280 align:start position:0%
to catch them all and the applications
 
01:42:10.550 --> 01:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
although they're done at the local
 
01:42:13.129 --> 01:42:13.139 align:start position:0%
school district
 
01:42:17.090 --> 01:42:17.100 align:start position:0%
um they are collected at the SAU level
 
01:42:19.129 --> 01:42:19.139 align:start position:0%
so that would be
 
01:42:21.290 --> 01:42:21.300 align:start position:0%
um fully captured at the SAU level
 
01:42:23.030 --> 01:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
because there's certain
 
01:42:25.490 --> 01:42:25.500 align:start position:0%
um steps that need to be done as per the
 
01:42:28.790 --> 01:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
USA USDA on verification of the
 
01:42:31.430 --> 01:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
applications and so on and so forth so
 
01:42:33.950 --> 01:42:33.960 align:start position:0%
that's done at an FAU level and not at a
 
01:42:38.390 --> 01:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:41.930 --> 01:42:41.940 align:start position:0%
other questions for
 
01:42:45.229 --> 01:42:45.239 align:start position:0%
representative just to comment all these
 
01:42:47.810 --> 01:42:47.820 align:start position:0%
brilliant brains here we need to be look
 
01:42:49.209 --> 01:42:49.219 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
01:42:52.790 --> 01:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
think outside the box and see if there's
 
01:42:55.910 --> 01:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
another way of figuring out needy
 
01:42:58.129 --> 01:42:58.139 align:start position:0%
students other than free and reduced
 
01:43:00.830 --> 01:43:00.840 align:start position:0%
lunch or needs in a community or
 
01:43:03.050 --> 01:43:03.060 align:start position:0%
whatever because we base everything on
 
01:43:06.050 --> 01:43:06.060 align:start position:0%
free and reduced lunch and then when we
 
01:43:08.330 --> 01:43:08.340 align:start position:0%
don't get applications filled out or
 
01:43:12.229 --> 01:43:12.239 align:start position:0%
whatever we don't get it so we need to
 
01:43:14.990 --> 01:43:15.000 align:start position:0%
be trying to I don't know see if there's
 
01:43:16.490 --> 01:43:16.500 align:start position:0%
some totally different way we haven't
 
01:43:19.790 --> 01:43:19.800 align:start position:0%
looked at yet to figure out where needs
 
01:43:21.410 --> 01:43:21.420 align:start position:0%
are and where they aren't because free
 
01:43:24.350 --> 01:43:24.360 align:start position:0%
and reduced lunch has issues I would
 
01:43:26.689 --> 01:43:26.699 align:start position:0%
agree with you just it's just that so
 
01:43:30.169 --> 01:43:30.179 align:start position:0%
much funding is attached to the data for
 
01:43:33.410 --> 01:43:33.420 align:start position:0%
free and reduced lunch uh that while
 
01:43:34.910 --> 01:43:34.920 align:start position:0%
we're thinking outside the box I think
 
01:43:37.490 --> 01:43:37.500 align:start position:0%
we got to do a better job at collecting
 
01:43:41.030 --> 01:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
numbers too so Kelly can I ask you a
 
01:43:41.040 --> 01:43:42.050 align:start position:0%
numbers too so Kelly can I ask you a
question

01:43:42.050 --> 01:43:42.060 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:43:42.060 --> 01:43:42.709 align:start position:0%
question
um

01:43:42.709 --> 01:43:42.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:46.250 --> 01:43:46.260 align:start position:0%
okay in your office it's the office of
 
01:43:48.169 --> 01:43:48.179 align:start position:0%
school nutrition is that what that what
 
01:43:48.179 --> 01:43:49.729 align:start position:0%
school nutrition is that what that what
you're

01:43:49.729 --> 01:43:49.739 align:start position:0%
you're
 
01:43:51.410 --> 01:43:51.420 align:start position:0%
um yes nutrition programs and services
 
01:43:53.450 --> 01:43:53.460 align:start position:0%
okay all right I
 
01:43:56.450 --> 01:43:56.460 align:start position:0%
things uh how many people are working in
 
01:43:58.070 --> 01:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
that office
 
01:44:01.370 --> 01:44:01.380 align:start position:0%
um currently right now we have six okay
 
01:44:03.950 --> 01:44:03.960 align:start position:0%
and that is encumbrance of
 
01:44:06.169 --> 01:44:06.179 align:start position:0%
um not only national school lunch so we
 
01:44:09.410 --> 01:44:09.420 align:start position:0%
handle the child and adult care programs
 
01:44:11.930 --> 01:44:11.940 align:start position:0%
summer programs
 
01:44:11.940 --> 01:44:13.189 align:start position:0%
summer programs
um

01:44:13.189 --> 01:44:13.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:14.810 --> 01:44:14.820 align:start position:0%
fresh fruit and vegetable program
 
01:44:18.590 --> 01:44:18.600 align:start position:0%
special milk program so all of the Child
 
01:44:20.209 --> 01:44:20.219 align:start position:0%
Nutrition programs that are funded by
 
01:44:25.270 --> 01:44:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:28.850 --> 01:44:28.860 align:start position:0%
if I if I were evil I would ask you
 
01:44:30.410 --> 01:44:30.420 align:start position:0%
whether or not you think that you have
 
01:44:33.530 --> 01:44:33.540 align:start position:0%
adequate Staffing in your office but uh
 
01:44:35.330 --> 01:44:35.340 align:start position:0%
you I I don't know that you could
 
01:44:37.850 --> 01:44:37.860 align:start position:0%
probably answer that question I
 
01:44:40.430 --> 01:44:40.440 align:start position:0%
appreciate not and and answering that
 
01:44:41.930 --> 01:44:41.940 align:start position:0%
question well I just want you to know
 
01:44:44.149 --> 01:44:44.159 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking it thank you thank you
 
01:44:46.370 --> 01:44:46.380 align:start position:0%
you're welcome I think she's a volunteer
 
01:44:50.410 --> 01:44:50.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:53.990 --> 01:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
yes I I would agree
 
01:44:56.270 --> 01:44:56.280 align:start position:0%
representative Paul I was just going to
 
01:44:57.890 --> 01:44:57.900 align:start position:0%
follow up on an earlier statement that I
 
01:44:59.930 --> 01:44:59.940 align:start position:0%
made I want to make clear that I would I
 
01:45:01.790 --> 01:45:01.800 align:start position:0%
do not go to school hungry and our
 
01:45:05.030 --> 01:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
family was probably the best one best
 
01:45:07.729 --> 01:45:07.739 align:start position:0%
fed family in town living on a farm so I
 
01:45:09.169 --> 01:45:09.179 align:start position:0%
didn't want to suggest that I went to
 
01:45:10.609 --> 01:45:10.619 align:start position:0%
school hungry because I definitely did
 
01:45:10.619 --> 01:45:12.470 align:start position:0%
school hungry because I definitely did
not

01:45:12.470 --> 01:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:45:14.750 --> 01:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
representative Fleck is
 
01:45:17.870 --> 01:45:17.880 align:start position:0%
so I have a question you you deal with
 
01:45:19.729 --> 01:45:19.739 align:start position:0%
fresh fruits and vegetables and all that
 
01:45:21.830 --> 01:45:21.840 align:start position:0%
kind of stuff
 
01:45:23.570 --> 01:45:23.580 align:start position:0%
um and the program we were talking about
 
01:45:26.270 --> 01:45:26.280 align:start position:0%
Farm to school had an administrator and
 
01:45:28.550 --> 01:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
testing and you just all kind you know
 
01:45:31.450 --> 01:45:31.460 align:start position:0%
tracking food and all kinds of stuff
 
01:45:35.090 --> 01:45:35.100 align:start position:0%
if we were to do if we were to and that
 
01:45:36.590 --> 01:45:36.600 align:start position:0%
seemed like it was going to spend a
 
01:45:39.229 --> 01:45:39.239 align:start position:0%
chunk of the available money on on
 
01:45:41.750 --> 01:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
overhead and administration so the
 
01:45:43.970 --> 01:45:43.980 align:start position:0%
question is
 
01:45:43.980 --> 01:45:45.410 align:start position:0%
question is
um

01:45:45.410 --> 01:45:45.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:47.689 --> 01:45:47.699 align:start position:0%
I guess if we had a volunteer program
 
01:45:49.790 --> 01:45:49.800 align:start position:0%
the schools with the local
 
01:45:49.800 --> 01:45:51.310 align:start position:0%
the schools with the local
Farms

01:45:51.310 --> 01:45:51.320 align:start position:0%
Farms
 
01:45:55.310 --> 01:45:55.320 align:start position:0%
would we need administration at the at
 
01:45:58.550 --> 01:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
your level and would you be able to do
 
01:46:01.689 --> 01:46:01.699 align:start position:0%
you know help out with that with the
 
01:46:05.149 --> 01:46:05.159 align:start position:0%
people and funding that you have now
 
01:46:07.790 --> 01:46:07.800 align:start position:0%
with the current funding with the
 
01:46:09.470 --> 01:46:09.480 align:start position:0%
current people that you have you know
 
01:46:13.270 --> 01:46:13.280 align:start position:0%
the funding for your admin your
 
01:46:16.669 --> 01:46:16.679 align:start position:0%
employees and with the current staff
 
01:46:19.910 --> 01:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
that you have now as far as just helping
 
01:46:21.709 --> 01:46:21.719 align:start position:0%
schools make arrangements if they want
 
01:46:23.870 --> 01:46:23.880 align:start position:0%
to do it if things have to be done I
 
01:46:28.910 --> 01:46:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:28.920 --> 01:46:31.209 align:start position:0%
 
sure

01:46:31.209 --> 01:46:31.219 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:46:36.410 --> 01:46:36.420 align:start position:0%
uh okay so just a reminder that you're
 
01:46:38.470 --> 01:46:38.480 align:start position:0%
going to email me
 
01:46:42.050 --> 01:46:42.060 align:start position:0%
with potential suggestions for
 
01:46:47.270 --> 01:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
legislation or areas of uh study or
 
01:46:49.310 --> 01:46:49.320 align:start position:0%
investigation or whatever however you
 
01:46:51.830 --> 01:46:51.840 align:start position:0%
want to phrase it
 
01:46:54.229 --> 01:46:54.239 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:46:57.470 --> 01:46:57.480 align:start position:0%
uh and I will put something together and
 
01:46:57.480 --> 01:46:58.570 align:start position:0%
uh and I will put something together and
then

01:46:58.570 --> 01:46:58.580 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:47:01.609 --> 01:47:01.619 align:start position:0%
I would assume that what that we're
 
01:47:03.290 --> 01:47:03.300 align:start position:0%
probably going to do what representative
 
01:47:06.709 --> 01:47:06.719 align:start position:0%
Ladd had suggested and that is meet ever
 
01:47:09.709 --> 01:47:09.719 align:start position:0%
so briefly on the morning of the 24th
 
01:47:13.189 --> 01:47:13.199 align:start position:0%
before the meeting begins
 
01:47:15.410 --> 01:47:15.420 align:start position:0%
we're here for a full day I'm not sure
 
01:47:17.629 --> 01:47:17.639 align:start position:0%
what time we're coming in that day we
 
01:47:17.639 --> 01:47:22.430 align:start position:0%
what time we're coming in that day we
started

01:47:22.430 --> 01:47:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:24.169 --> 01:47:24.179 align:start position:0%
starting up a work deal we at one
 
01:47:26.090 --> 01:47:26.100 align:start position:0%
o'clock so I'm hoping to get things done
 
01:47:28.910 --> 01:47:28.920 align:start position:0%
in the morning right so you're gonna
 
01:47:31.189 --> 01:47:31.199 align:start position:0%
have if you're going to meet briefly
 
01:47:34.669 --> 01:47:34.679 align:start position:0%
before yep the meaning you should put it
 
01:47:38.270 --> 01:47:38.280 align:start position:0%
in the calendar because it's going to be
 
01:47:38.280 --> 01:47:39.550 align:start position:0%
in the calendar because it's going to be
um

01:47:39.550 --> 01:47:39.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:42.590 --> 01:47:42.600 align:start position:0%
would you all be able to meet at nine
 
01:47:42.600 --> 01:47:53.290 align:start position:0%
would you all be able to meet at nine
foreign

01:47:53.290 --> 01:47:53.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:55.970 --> 01:47:55.980 align:start position:0%
I'm just procedurally I'm just wondering
 
01:47:59.090 --> 01:47:59.100 align:start position:0%
whether or not it has to be uh a meeting
 
01:48:02.629 --> 01:48:02.639 align:start position:0%
that can be witnessed whether it has to
 
01:48:05.330 --> 01:48:05.340 align:start position:0%
be a public meeting so
 
01:48:07.370 --> 01:48:07.380 align:start position:0%
you could do it in two minutes yeah yeah
 
01:48:16.189 --> 01:48:16.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:19.970 --> 01:48:19.980 align:start position:0%
all right 9 15 Jen would you mind uh
 
01:48:21.950 --> 01:48:21.960 align:start position:0%
asking Lindsay if she'll
 
01:48:23.870 --> 01:48:23.880 align:start position:0%
notice that
 
01:48:26.629 --> 01:48:26.639 align:start position:0%
and then I will make sure that you folks
 
01:48:28.490 --> 01:48:28.500 align:start position:0%
have the document ahead of time but we
 
01:48:30.590 --> 01:48:30.600 align:start position:0%
will just for the sake of public record
 
01:48:33.830 --> 01:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
be able to uh read it into do you know
 
01:48:35.629 --> 01:48:35.639 align:start position:0%
if one that on that day all the
 
01:48:40.930 --> 01:48:40.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:43.790 --> 01:48:43.800 align:start position:0%
oh yeah this are all the Committees
 
01:48:46.189 --> 01:48:46.199 align:start position:0%
having something on that day no okay so
 
01:48:48.350 --> 01:48:48.360 align:start position:0%
I guess my question too is and it just
 
01:48:51.109 --> 01:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
for Expedition Expediting the issue if
 
01:48:53.390 --> 01:48:53.400 align:start position:0%
uh you could have the meeting in another
 
01:48:56.090 --> 01:48:56.100 align:start position:0%
room since Rick's meeting at 9 30 people
 
01:48:57.109 --> 01:48:57.119 align:start position:0%
will be assembly while we're trying to
 
01:48:59.629 --> 01:48:59.639 align:start position:0%
do this stuff if you could just let me
 
01:49:04.870 --> 01:49:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:07.490 --> 01:49:07.500 align:start position:0%
I was really hoping
 
01:49:58.689 --> 01:49:58.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:02.090 --> 01:50:02.100 align:start position:0%
not a horrible idea just trying to
 
01:50:05.030 --> 01:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
follow procedure so that we're legit
 
01:50:07.850 --> 01:50:07.860 align:start position:0%
that's all
 
01:50:11.990 --> 01:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
so Jen for my edification I could would
 
01:50:15.410 --> 01:50:15.420 align:start position:0%
you set that meeting at nine
 
01:50:15.420 --> 01:50:16.490 align:start position:0%
you set that meeting at nine
and

01:50:16.490 --> 01:50:16.500 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:50:19.310 --> 01:50:19.320 align:start position:0%
yeah and that way if people get stuck in
 
01:50:22.189 --> 01:50:22.199 align:start position:0%
traffic if there's uh so we'll we'll
 
01:50:25.189 --> 01:50:25.199 align:start position:0%
meet at nine on the 24th
 
01:50:27.169 --> 01:50:27.179 align:start position:0%
and that way we'll be uh sorry about
 
01:50:29.990 --> 01:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
that representative Woodcock will be as
 
01:50:32.510 --> 01:50:32.520 align:start position:0%
gentle as we possibly can be if you're
 
01:50:32.520 --> 01:50:38.830 align:start position:0%
gentle as we possibly can be if you're
late

01:50:38.830 --> 01:50:38.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:41.990 --> 01:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
so beforehand we can be
 
01:50:44.629 --> 01:50:44.639 align:start position:0%
putting comments ins and saying no
 
01:50:47.510 --> 01:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
please change no I don't you know Etc so
 
01:50:49.250 --> 01:50:49.260 align:start position:0%
that pretty much by the time we're done
 
01:50:51.470 --> 01:50:51.480 align:start position:0%
with our document
 
01:50:53.570 --> 01:50:53.580 align:start position:0%
we're ready to go
 
01:51:08.570 --> 01:51:08.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:12.669 --> 01:51:12.679 align:start position:0%
we adjourn this meeting uh I second that
 
01:51:15.169 --> 01:51:15.179 align:start position:0%

01:51:18.050 --> 01:51:18.060 align:start position:0%
