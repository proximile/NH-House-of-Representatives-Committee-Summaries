hearing
 
00:03:04.369 --> 00:03:04.379 align:start position:0%
um this bill requires a tabulation of
 
00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 align:start position:0%
votes in an election to be done in
 
00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:07.790 align:start position:0%
votes in an election to be done in
public

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 align:start position:0%
public
 
00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 align:start position:0%
um I don't have any pink cards for HB
 
00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
243 oh there's representative catab
 
00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 align:start position:0%
there's a cop we just introduced your
 
00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:25.130 align:start position:0%
there's a cop we just introduced your
bill

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 align:start position:0%
all right we'll uh we'll do the old
 
00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
do-over we'll act like we like
 
00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 align:start position:0%
representative wood didn't just do that
 
00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 align:start position:0%
we'll start from the top representative
 
00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 align:start position:0%
you want to take a moment to gather
 
00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 align:start position:0%
yourself or you said you good to go
 
00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 align:start position:0%
um it's all right I'll just get going so
 
00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 align:start position:0%
um for the record I'm representative
 
00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 align:start position:0%
Caitlin kutab I represent Rockingham
 
00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 align:start position:0%
District 17 Windham
 
00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 align:start position:0%
this Bell
 
00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:51.599 align:start position:0%
this is Maya
 
00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:56.159 align:start position:0%
um this bill seeks to clarify that the
 
00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 align:start position:0%
tabulation of votes must be done in
 
00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:59.869 align:start position:0%
tabulation of votes must be done in
public

00:03:59.869 --> 00:03:59.879 align:start position:0%
public
 
00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:02.819 align:start position:0%
it's a bit ambiguous now so some towns
 
00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 align:start position:0%
are doing the tabulation public others
 
00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 align:start position:0%
are not in Windham we did not as a
 
00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:10.970 align:start position:0%
are not in Windham we did not as a
result

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 align:start position:0%
result
 
00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 align:start position:0%
it was late at night some mistakes
 
00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 align:start position:0%
were thought to have been made and
 
00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
the tabulation was later corrected
 
00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.790 align:start position:0%
the tabulation was later corrected
and

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 align:start position:0%
I would say it was a bit
 
00:04:26.749 --> 00:04:26.759 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional because the
 
00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
Constitution does provide that if you're
 
00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
counting votes it must be done in the
 
00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 align:start position:0%
presence of the selectman and it didn't
 
00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 align:start position:0%
happen but nonetheless the winner of the
 
00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 align:start position:0%
floaterial seat in the primary was
 
00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 align:start position:0%
incorrectly changed
 
00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
after on Monday after the election and
 
00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:50.759 align:start position:0%
the deadline to request a recount is
 
00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:52.129 align:start position:0%
the deadline to request a recount is
Friday

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:52.139 align:start position:0%
Friday
 
00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 align:start position:0%
so at that point
 
00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
you couldn't request a recount
 
00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
thankfully the person who had lost
 
00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 align:start position:0%
had already requested the recount and
 
00:05:02.749 --> 00:05:02.759 align:start position:0%
didn't rescind his request for the
 
00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.100 align:start position:0%
recount so when we did the recount it
 
00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 align:start position:0%
was determined that
 
00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:09.479 align:start position:0%
actually the original winner did win so
 
00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 align:start position:0%
this is just seeking to clarify so that
 
00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 align:start position:0%
we can make sure that the tabulation is
 
00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:16.940 align:start position:0%
done correctly and that we're not
 
00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620 align:start position:0%
disenfranchising voters you know we can
 
00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:21.600 align:start position:0%
watch and see within the the four foot
 
00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 align:start position:0%
rail we can watch as their
 
00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 align:start position:0%
counting any of the manual ballots we
 
00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 align:start position:0%
can see the vote tapes but what we don't
 
00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560 align:start position:0%
get to see afterwards is then putting it
 
00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 align:start position:0%
all together and although the tapes are
 
00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 align:start position:0%
posted afterwards on a whiteboard
 
00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.610 align:start position:0%
posted afterwards on a whiteboard
the

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:37.620 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.230 align:start position:0%
the
um

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
calculation sheets are not my dad said
 
00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 align:start position:0%
um the tabulation sheets are not posted
 
00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 align:start position:0%
afterwards for any of the
 
00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
um manual vote counts so this is just
 
00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
clarifying that they both have to be
 
00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:54.419 align:start position:0%
done in public happy to take any
 
00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:56.090 align:start position:0%
done in public happy to take any
questions

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:56.100 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:57.240 align:start position:0%
the questions from the committee yes
 
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.120 align:start position:0%
representative Lane um thank you
 
00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:03.539 align:start position:0%
Mr Vice chair and representative
 
00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:04.610 align:start position:0%
Mr Vice chair and representative
um

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:04.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:06.360 align:start position:0%
was when you were talking about the
 
00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.000 align:start position:0%
results was that this past election or
 
00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:12.840 align:start position:0%
the election okay so is this password it
 
00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
was this past election
 
00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:16.860 align:start position:0%
okay could I have a follow-up please of
 
00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:17.689 align:start position:0%
okay could I have a follow-up please of
course

00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:17.699 align:start position:0%
course
 
00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:21.360 align:start position:0%
um logistically is it possible I I'm not
 
00:06:22.969 --> 00:06:22.979 align:start position:0%
familiar with the setup at Wyndham but
 
00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:25.380 align:start position:0%
is it possible to set it up so it can be
 
00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:29.060 align:start position:0%
seen yes so
 
00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:31.919 align:start position:0%
to my knowledge every polling place has
 
00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:33.660 align:start position:0%
to do the counting in public so they
 
00:06:35.749 --> 00:06:35.759 align:start position:0%
have to have that they have to have that
 
00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
four foot rail in place
 
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
so all of the towns have that four foot
 
00:06:41.809 --> 00:06:41.819 align:start position:0%
rail in place it's just a matter of if
 
00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:44.220 align:start position:0%
they're choosing to use that four foot
 
00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:46.919 align:start position:0%
rail to then do their tabulation or not
 
00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:49.380 align:start position:0%
in my town they decided not to
 
00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:50.940 align:start position:0%
they did it way in the corner of the gym
 
00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:54.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:56.100 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
representative Hamer
 
00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:02.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:06.840 align:start position:0%
voting machine is a tabulator
 
00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:11.400 align:start position:0%
it adds them up adds up the votes
 
00:07:14.629 --> 00:07:14.639 align:start position:0%
so yes for for the for the machines
 
00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:16.080 align:start position:0%
that's correct
 
00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:19.860 align:start position:0%
but then what doesn't happen I guess is
 
00:07:22.189 --> 00:07:22.199 align:start position:0%
the final tabulation between the machine
 
00:07:24.529 --> 00:07:24.539 align:start position:0%
count of all the votes and remember like
 
00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:26.940 align:start position:0%
many of the towns have you know multiple
 
00:07:29.089 --> 00:07:29.099 align:start position:0%
machines like Windham for example has
 
00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
four different machines and then we also
 
00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
had the hand counted ballots from each
 
00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:39.300 align:start position:0%
of the machines and the all of that so
 
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:41.400 align:start position:0%
it's the tabulation of everything coming
 
00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:44.830 align:start position:0%
it's the tabulation of everything coming
together

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:47.749 --> 00:07:47.759 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up
 
00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:49.730 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up
um

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:49.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:51.589 --> 00:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
when do you expect this is going to be
 
00:07:55.129 --> 00:07:55.139 align:start position:0%
done because voting stops at seven eight
 
00:07:57.710 --> 00:07:57.720 align:start position:0%
and then it takes time to go through
 
00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
everything are people going to hang
 
00:08:01.969 --> 00:08:01.979 align:start position:0%
around that long
 
00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:04.440 align:start position:0%
they did in Windham I was there until 3
 
00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:06.900 align:start position:0%
30 in the morning while they did it it
 
00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:08.940 align:start position:0%
the under the Constitution you have to
 
00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:11.400 align:start position:0%
do it within five days so they can break
 
00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
and and come back the next day but it
 
00:08:16.309 --> 00:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
still has to be done in public in the
 
00:08:19.369 --> 00:08:19.379 align:start position:0%
presence of the select bin so
 
00:08:21.409 --> 00:08:21.419 align:start position:0%
um I'm just simply asking that that
 
00:08:23.689 --> 00:08:23.699 align:start position:0%
tabulation piece is also public so that
 
00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:26.220 align:start position:0%
we're being transparent and that we can
 
00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
have confidence in the elections because
 
00:08:30.469 --> 00:08:30.479 align:start position:0%
I think right now there's
 
00:08:32.449 --> 00:08:32.459 align:start position:0%
a confidence issue and we need to make
 
00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:35.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:37.860 align:start position:0%
voters are confident that that their
 
00:08:39.649 --> 00:08:39.659 align:start position:0%
vote is indeed counting because I think
 
00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:41.640 align:start position:0%
we have many people that are like why
 
00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
should I bother to go out and vote
 
00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
because it's not going to count anyway
 
00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
we need them to know that yes your vote
 
00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:50.540 align:start position:0%
is counting it's all happening in public
 
00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:52.380 align:start position:0%
I think this will give them that
 
00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:54.550 align:start position:0%
I think this will give them that
confidence

00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
confidence
 
00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
representative Hamlet thank you Mr chair
 
00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:00.600 align:start position:0%
Mr Vice chair and thank you for taking
 
00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:05.640 align:start position:0%
my question so in Windham are the four
 
00:09:08.389 --> 00:09:08.399 align:start position:0%
voting machines in the same place or are
 
00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:10.140 align:start position:0%
they in different like in different
 
00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:11.810 align:start position:0%
they in different like in different
wards

00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:11.820 align:start position:0%
wards
 
00:09:14.389 --> 00:09:14.399 align:start position:0%
Barrel in the same location
 
00:09:16.329 --> 00:09:16.339 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
so in Portsmouth we have
 
00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:21.300 align:start position:0%
uh five Awards so there are five
 
00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:23.940 align:start position:0%
different voting locations so when you
 
00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:27.240 align:start position:0%
mean tabulating uh tabulating the total
 
00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:29.940 align:start position:0%
votes from all five Wards those would be
 
00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
done at City Hall
 
00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:33.720 align:start position:0%
after the
 
00:09:35.269 --> 00:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
um you know after all the words have
 
00:09:38.269 --> 00:09:38.279 align:start position:0%
turned in their uh totals from their
 
00:09:38.279 --> 00:09:39.350 align:start position:0%
turned in their uh totals from their
Ward

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:39.360 align:start position:0%
Ward
 
00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:43.260 align:start position:0%
so is that the tabulation that you want
 
00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
to be public that would occur at
 
00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:48.240 align:start position:0%
probably at 1am usually
 
00:09:50.509 --> 00:09:50.519 align:start position:0%
um so I'd like all the tabulation to be
 
00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:52.620 align:start position:0%
in public but ideally what I mean is in
 
00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:54.240 align:start position:0%
each of those Wards we're going to be
 
00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:57.240 align:start position:0%
tabulating together the
 
00:09:59.690 --> 00:09:59.700 align:start position:0%
vote Counts from the machines and then
 
00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:01.860 align:start position:0%
the hand count tabulation sheets and
 
00:10:03.769 --> 00:10:03.779 align:start position:0%
adding all those up together for each of
 
00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:06.120 align:start position:0%
the awards and I think it's very
 
00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:09.480 align:start position:0%
important that that be public because if
 
00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:11.220 align:start position:0%
there's somebody in each of those five
 
00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
words for example then those people
 
00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:15.060 align:start position:0%
would have already known like what they
 
00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:16.740 align:start position:0%
are and what the final should be but yes
 
00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:19.860 align:start position:0%
I don't in the in the town hall I mean
 
00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:21.480 align:start position:0%
it's required under the Constitution for
 
00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:23.220 align:start position:0%
a tip for for all of the accounting to
 
00:10:25.009 --> 00:10:25.019 align:start position:0%
be public so that should be public as
 
00:10:25.019 --> 00:10:27.470 align:start position:0%
be public so that should be public as
well

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:29.700 align:start position:0%
representative Bay
 
00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
so um similar to representative Hamlet's
 
00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:35.220 align:start position:0%
uh question because uh I live in Dover
 
00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
and we have six Wars each one has a
 
00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:39.660 align:start position:0%
counting machine so I think that the
 
00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:41.640 align:start position:0%
counting is is public people are there
 
00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
but uh given that they're all in in
 
00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:46.380 align:start position:0%
different words you're saying the
 
00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:48.540 align:start position:0%
tabulation is to put together all of
 
00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:51.300 align:start position:0%
those numbers in one and the way that it
 
00:10:54.949 --> 00:10:54.959 align:start position:0%
happens in in our uh in in Dover is that
 
00:10:57.829 --> 00:10:57.839 align:start position:0%
uh the next day we see
 
00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:00.420 align:start position:0%
um the the sheets that were submitted
 
00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
from each Ward and to me anyway the
 
00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
tabulation is online because the all the
 
00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:10.380 align:start position:0%
votes are are counted so would you
 
00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
consider that type of tabulation where
 
00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:14.220 align:start position:0%
all the numbers are there counted
 
00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:16.140 align:start position:0%
publicly so you can check whether the
 
00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:18.540 align:start position:0%
numbers that were put together are are
 
00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:21.720 align:start position:0%
the same numbers and the tabulation is
 
00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:24.120 align:start position:0%
online it's available on the Internet is
 
00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
that what uh would that qualify as uh
 
00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
your recommendation as far as tabulation
 
00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
being public yes as long as again like
 
00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:35.880 align:start position:0%
in those individual Awards they could
 
00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:39.480 align:start position:0%
watch the voting tapes be added up with
 
00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:40.850 align:start position:0%
watch the voting tapes be added up with
the

00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:40.860 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:41.990 align:start position:0%
the
um

00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:44.220 align:start position:0%
hand count ballot sheets being added
 
00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:45.050 align:start position:0%
hand count ballot sheets being added
together

00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:45.060 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:48.180 align:start position:0%
if in terms of like combining all six
 
00:11:50.449 --> 00:11:50.459 align:start position:0%
together as long as that was public and
 
00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:52.440 align:start position:0%
that they had each been able to see like
 
00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:54.180 align:start position:0%
hey from each Ward this was accurate
 
00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:57.060 align:start position:0%
absolutely that's fine
 
00:11:59.389 --> 00:11:59.399 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chair further
 
00:12:01.069 --> 00:12:01.079 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:03.180 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none um thank you
 
00:12:05.389 --> 00:12:05.399 align:start position:0%
representative kutab
 
00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
um next up is representative uh papovisi
 
00:12:11.509 --> 00:12:11.519 align:start position:0%
Mueller did I get that
 
00:12:13.069 --> 00:12:13.079 align:start position:0%
how close was I there you're gonna have
 
00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:16.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:19.009 --> 00:12:19.019 align:start position:0%
I think Mr chairman I know it's my turn
 
00:12:20.569 --> 00:12:20.579 align:start position:0%
to speak every time when I see that
 
00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:22.380 align:start position:0%
chair take a couple of seconds to figure
 
00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
out the name so you don't even really
 
00:12:26.449 --> 00:12:26.459 align:start position:0%
need to pronounce it technically it's
 
00:12:29.269 --> 00:12:29.279 align:start position:0%
Popovich Mueller but it's fine
 
00:12:31.009 --> 00:12:31.019 align:start position:0%
um I just want to take one minute from
 
00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:33.060 align:start position:0%
the committee I try to keep my testimony
 
00:12:35.269 --> 00:12:35.279 align:start position:0%
really short for obvious reasons you
 
00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:37.200 align:start position:0%
guys have a really long day ahead of you
 
00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:39.300 align:start position:0%
and it will feature quite a lot of bills
 
00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:41.160 align:start position:0%
that my name is on I don't know how the
 
00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
scheduling work worked this is one of
 
00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:46.380 align:start position:0%
the simplest all it asks for is
 
00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:48.050 align:start position:0%
the simplest all it asks for is
transparency

00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:48.060 align:start position:0%
transparency
 
00:12:50.449 --> 00:12:50.459 align:start position:0%
transparency is important to build to
 
00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:53.000 align:start position:0%
build trust in the election system and
 
00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
unfortunately in Windham we have had
 
00:13:00.009 --> 00:13:00.019 align:start position:0%
quite a recent set of experiences that
 
00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:02.940 align:start position:0%
led to town people feeling less than
 
00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
confident in what's going on this
 
00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:07.260 align:start position:0%
incident that we are talking about could
 
00:13:10.009 --> 00:13:10.019 align:start position:0%
have changed the election result in ways
 
00:13:11.569 --> 00:13:11.579 align:start position:0%
that would have made it impossible for
 
00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:13.740 align:start position:0%
the person who you know was going to
 
00:13:16.009 --> 00:13:16.019 align:start position:0%
lose if that incorrect set of results
 
00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:18.120 align:start position:0%
would have been upheld
 
00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:19.680 align:start position:0%
you know and they wouldn't have had the
 
00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:20.760 align:start position:0%
recourse because they announced the
 
00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:22.500 align:start position:0%
change after the deadline to ask for a
 
00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:25.380 align:start position:0%
recount so it was a pretty significant
 
00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:27.480 align:start position:0%
issue and for the record to this day we
 
00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:29.100 align:start position:0%
don't know exactly what the error was
 
00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:31.500 align:start position:0%
the town is not talking about it they
 
00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
were asked and all that they are saying
 
00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:34.069 align:start position:0%
were asked and all that they are saying
is

00:13:34.069 --> 00:13:34.079 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:37.380 align:start position:0%
pretty much a nothing to see here if
 
00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:39.720 align:start position:0%
you've ever watched Leslie Nielsen Naked
 
00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:42.720 align:start position:0%
Gun that scene in front of the fireworks
 
00:13:44.569 --> 00:13:44.579 align:start position:0%
store everything exploding that's that's
 
00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:46.620 align:start position:0%
kind of how the town handled this they
 
00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:47.880 align:start position:0%
basically said
 
00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:49.800 align:start position:0%
from the beginning first they said there
 
00:13:51.949 --> 00:13:51.959 align:start position:0%
is nothing wrong
 
00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:54.060 align:start position:0%
then the recount happened and it proved
 
00:13:56.690 --> 00:13:56.700 align:start position:0%
that yeah something was wrong then they
 
00:13:58.670 --> 00:13:58.680 align:start position:0%
said oh we know exactly what was wrong
 
00:14:02.449 --> 00:14:02.459 align:start position:0%
trastas I mean they never said exactly
 
00:14:03.889 --> 00:14:03.899 align:start position:0%
what they draw what what happened that
 
00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:06.360 align:start position:0%
was wrong so we need more transparency
 
00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:08.700 align:start position:0%
in the process and it's not just Windham
 
00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
Windham is just happens to be the town I
 
00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
live in
 
00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:13.740 align:start position:0%
there is a lot of distrust in the
 
00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:16.380 align:start position:0%
election process and allowing people to
 
00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:18.120 align:start position:0%
monitor more of it creating more
 
00:14:20.449 --> 00:14:20.459 align:start position:0%
transparency should be a very bipartisan
 
00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:22.860 align:start position:0%
goal where we all agree we need
 
00:14:24.889 --> 00:14:24.899 align:start position:0%
confidence in the system and allowing
 
00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:27.660 align:start position:0%
people to observe more would build some
 
00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:30.300 align:start position:0%
of that confidence and that's all I
 
00:14:32.329 --> 00:14:32.339 align:start position:0%
wanted to say thank you okay questions
 
00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
will you be taking questions first
 
00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:40.189 --> 00:14:40.199 align:start position:0%
okay seeing none thank you thank you I
 
00:14:41.090 --> 00:14:41.100 align:start position:0%
think there's some more pink cards
 
00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
making their way here let's see if
 
00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:49.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:56.820 align:start position:0%
um sorry nope there's neither number for
 
00:14:58.430 --> 00:14:58.440 align:start position:0%
this bill uh are there anyone anyone
 
00:15:01.129 --> 00:15:01.139 align:start position:0%
else wishing to speak on this bill
 
00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:03.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
it's good to see you again I think we've
 
00:15:07.009 --> 00:15:07.019 align:start position:0%
have we seen you yet this year
 
00:15:08.810 --> 00:15:08.820 align:start position:0%
oh man
 
00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:11.220 align:start position:0%
you're out of Nashua now right I was
 
00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:13.980 align:start position:0%
watching you on the uh the city I'm I'm
 
00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:17.220 align:start position:0%
the guy that watches those uh those uh
 
00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:19.860 align:start position:0%
city clerk hearings or city council
 
00:15:21.829 --> 00:15:21.839 align:start position:0%
hearings I'm that guy can you turn your
 
00:15:25.189 --> 00:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
mic on for us so Dan Healy I'm
 
00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
representing uh myself uh so our
 
00:15:30.889 --> 00:15:30.899 align:start position:0%
associate our clerk Association
 
00:15:32.569 --> 00:15:32.579 align:start position:0%
um we don't have an opinion on this bill
 
00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
so basically
 
00:15:36.949 --> 00:15:36.959 align:start position:0%
our feeling is that we believe the
 
00:15:39.769 --> 00:15:39.779 align:start position:0%
tabulation and Counting already takes
 
00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:42.300 align:start position:0%
place in public I just wanted to clarify
 
00:15:45.949 --> 00:15:45.959 align:start position:0%
some comments made by the sponsor so on
 
00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:48.300 align:start position:0%
Election night all the results are done
 
00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:49.740 align:start position:0%
in public
 
00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:51.720 align:start position:0%
um inside the guardrail the counting the
 
00:15:53.689 --> 00:15:53.699 align:start position:0%
tabulation you add up the machine tapes
 
00:15:57.530 --> 00:15:57.540 align:start position:0%
you add up the hand counts and that's
 
00:16:01.009 --> 00:16:01.019 align:start position:0%
what's sent to the Secretary of State if
 
00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
it's a state election and if it's a town
 
00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:05.100 align:start position:0%
or a local election that's the results
 
00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
that we put
 
00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:09.720 align:start position:0%
the next day most clerks or I would
 
00:16:11.509 --> 00:16:11.519 align:start position:0%
assume all clerks go in and they check
 
00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:13.260 align:start position:0%
their paperwork they check the machine
 
00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:15.540 align:start position:0%
tapes they check the hand count tallies
 
00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
and if they see that any adjustments are
 
00:16:20.689 --> 00:16:20.699 align:start position:0%
needed because something you know at one
 
00:16:21.949 --> 00:16:21.959 align:start position:0%
in the morning
 
00:16:25.189 --> 00:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
was written down incorrectly that's when
 
00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
they do it I believe that's what the
 
00:16:30.889 --> 00:16:30.899 align:start position:0%
representative was mentioning and so
 
00:16:34.069 --> 00:16:34.079 align:start position:0%
Windham came in you know the next day or
 
00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:36.540 align:start position:0%
whenever they did this and they noticed
 
00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:39.540 align:start position:0%
that there was a discrepancy on their
 
00:16:41.689 --> 00:16:41.699 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet so they corrected it
 
00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:43.980 align:start position:0%
their votes for that night of the
 
00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:46.860 align:start position:0%
election were counted in public inside
 
00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:49.560 align:start position:0%
the guardrail so
 
00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:53.100 align:start position:0%
I believe we already do this
 
00:16:55.189 --> 00:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
in what the representative was speaking
 
00:16:57.710 --> 00:16:57.720 align:start position:0%
to was a clerk noticing an error and
 
00:16:59.749 --> 00:16:59.759 align:start position:0%
then fixing it which is what we would
 
00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:01.500 align:start position:0%
want to happen
 
00:17:04.549 --> 00:17:04.559 align:start position:0%
I know Windham had an election monitor
 
00:17:07.429 --> 00:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
assigned to them and the report is
 
00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:10.079 align:start position:0%
available for those I believe it was for
 
00:17:13.429 --> 00:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
the primary in the election monitor gave
 
00:17:16.449 --> 00:17:16.459 align:start position:0%
them a great review for that election
 
00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:19.500 align:start position:0%
so I would be open to any questions if
 
00:17:20.689 --> 00:17:20.699 align:start position:0%
you have them
 
00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:21.780 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
representative Muirhead good to see you
 
00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:26.220 align:start position:0%
today thank you Mr chair
 
00:17:27.409 --> 00:17:27.419 align:start position:0%
could you explain what the difference
 
00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:30.540 align:start position:0%
between counting and tabulation is
 
00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:32.700 align:start position:0%
I believe
 
00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:35.340 align:start position:0%
um the counting is maybe adding the
 
00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:37.320 align:start position:0%
machine tape with the hand counts
 
00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:41.100 align:start position:0%
together because tabulation is the
 
00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
printout from the machine I believe the
 
00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:44.940 align:start position:0%
accuvote machine and then I think it's
 
00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:47.400 align:start position:0%
putting the two numbers together and you
 
00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
have to have the results that night you
 
00:17:53.450 --> 00:17:53.460 align:start position:0%
you can't you know end for the night and
 
00:17:55.970 --> 00:17:55.980 align:start position:0%
come back in and start adding them up
 
00:17:59.150 --> 00:17:59.160 align:start position:0%
but Clerk's check the next day you know
 
00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:03.780 align:start position:0%
for the last two elections in Nashua I
 
00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
left the city hall at four in the
 
00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
morning so
 
00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:09.480 align:start position:0%
you really want to go back and make sure
 
00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:11.640 align:start position:0%
that all those numbers tie out so what
 
00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:13.500 align:start position:0%
I'll do first thing in the morning when
 
00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:16.200 align:start position:0%
I get in is I'll look at the accuvo tape
 
00:18:18.169 --> 00:18:18.179 align:start position:0%
and I'll pull out the hand counts and
 
00:18:19.909 --> 00:18:19.919 align:start position:0%
we'll make sure that the number is total
 
00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:23.220 align:start position:0%
and that that's the correct numbers that
 
00:18:25.549 --> 00:18:25.559 align:start position:0%
we reported so I believe in this case
 
00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:27.960 align:start position:0%
Windham went back they noticed that
 
00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:29.940 align:start position:0%
there was a discrepancy and they they
 
00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:32.700 align:start position:0%
corrected it I think that's what you
 
00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:34.760 align:start position:0%
want to happen
 
00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:38.160 align:start position:0%
further questions represent Blaine
 
00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:47.700 align:start position:0%
with you that you explain why you're
 
00:18:49.669 --> 00:18:49.679 align:start position:0%
changing it to or do you make a notation
 
00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:53.100 align:start position:0%
or are you doing this solely on your own
 
00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:55.980 align:start position:0%
so for a town or municipal election it
 
00:18:59.210 --> 00:18:59.220 align:start position:0%
usually with the deputy or some other uh
 
00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:02.280 align:start position:0%
office staff if it's a state or a
 
00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:03.900 align:start position:0%
federal election we would make the
 
00:19:06.049 --> 00:19:06.059 align:start position:0%
change contact the Secretary of State
 
00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:08.520 align:start position:0%
and you'd send an amended amended
 
00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:09.590 align:start position:0%
and you'd send an amended amended
results

00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
results
 
00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:11.820 align:start position:0%
but you would have someone there that's
 
00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:13.620 align:start position:0%
looking at it with you and you'd say you
 
00:19:15.169 --> 00:19:15.179 align:start position:0%
know you have the accuvo tape out and
 
00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:17.220 align:start position:0%
you say well this number when they put
 
00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:19.320 align:start position:0%
it into the Excel spreadsheet they type
 
00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:22.140 align:start position:0%
this wrong digit in you know the two of
 
00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:24.600 align:start position:0%
you would verify that
 
00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:26.100 align:start position:0%
representative weary
 
00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:28.200 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for your testimony you
 
00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
commented that uh Windham tabulation was
 
00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:35.100 align:start position:0%
conducted in a public setting were you
 
00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:36.250 align:start position:0%
conducted in a public setting were you
there

00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:36.260 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:40.260 align:start position:0%
no I was not at uh Wyndham but the
 
00:19:42.409 --> 00:19:42.419 align:start position:0%
counting in the tabulation has to be
 
00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:47.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:49.549 --> 00:19:49.559 align:start position:0%
so if it's done in a follow-up yeah
 
00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:51.960 align:start position:0%
follow-up please thank you Mr chair
 
00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:52.549 align:start position:0%
follow-up please thank you Mr chair
um

00:19:52.549 --> 00:19:52.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:56.570 --> 00:19:56.580 align:start position:0%
so was it done in a spot where
 
00:19:59.630 --> 00:19:59.640 align:start position:0%
the actual activities could be clearly
 
00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
observed or was it just done publicly in
 
00:20:04.669 --> 00:20:04.679 align:start position:0%
a large room
 
00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:06.840 align:start position:0%
I I believe that they hold their
 
00:20:10.669 --> 00:20:10.679 align:start position:0%
elections at the high school gym in for
 
00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
the primary election they had a state
 
00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
assigned election monitor so
 
00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:16.130 align:start position:0%
assigned election monitor so
um

00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:16.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:19.100 align:start position:0%
I'm fairly confident for that election
 
00:20:22.669 --> 00:20:22.679 align:start position:0%
that it was done in an area where they
 
00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:23.820 align:start position:0%
could see but it would be in the
 
00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:26.900 align:start position:0%
election monitors report
 
00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:29.400 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
00:20:31.909 --> 00:20:31.919 align:start position:0%
oh yes representative Barnum
 
00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:34.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Vice chair
 
00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:37.140 align:start position:0%
um does the counting also include the
 
00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
ballots that have been released from the
 
00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:42.360 align:start position:0%
supervisor of the checklist total
 
00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:46.380 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I'm not following the question
 
00:20:48.169 --> 00:20:48.179 align:start position:0%
the checklist has a final total of how
 
00:20:51.529 --> 00:20:51.539 align:start position:0%
many how many ballots are given that day
 
00:20:53.570 --> 00:20:53.580 align:start position:0%
does that include count as well there's
 
00:20:55.610 --> 00:20:55.620 align:start position:0%
a just accounting of the voting
 
00:20:57.830 --> 00:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
ballots are you referring to the
 
00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:59.029 align:start position:0%
ballots are you referring to the
checklist

00:20:59.029 --> 00:20:59.039 align:start position:0%
checklist
 
00:21:01.010 --> 00:21:01.020 align:start position:0%
the the number of Voters off the
 
00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:03.240 align:start position:0%
checklist I think that he's trying to
 
00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
clarify the question for him so you're
 
00:21:06.169 --> 00:21:06.179 align:start position:0%
talking about the number of people who
 
00:21:08.150 --> 00:21:08.160 align:start position:0%
are crossed off the checklist
 
00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:11.580 align:start position:0%
when you enter to vote
 
00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
and you get your ballot they check your
 
00:21:16.669 --> 00:21:16.679 align:start position:0%
name usually there's a count for that
 
00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
how many ballots have been released is
 
00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
that part of the count as well or is it
 
00:21:22.549 --> 00:21:22.559 align:start position:0%
just the counting from the hand count
 
00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
balance that number would be on the
 
00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
moderators worksheet which needs to be
 
00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
provided to the Secretary of State
 
00:21:31.909 --> 00:21:31.919 align:start position:0%
within 48 Hours of the election so those
 
00:21:33.529 --> 00:21:33.539 align:start position:0%
numbers you want to tie out all your
 
00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:35.640 align:start position:0%
numbers so you count how many voters
 
00:21:38.570 --> 00:21:38.580 align:start position:0%
checked in you count how many ballots
 
00:21:40.010 --> 00:21:40.020 align:start position:0%
went through the machine how many were
 
00:21:41.810 --> 00:21:41.820 align:start position:0%
hand counted there's like three or four
 
00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
categories and the goal is that all
 
00:21:46.669 --> 00:21:46.679 align:start position:0%
those numbers match because you should
 
00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
have the you know the ballots that you
 
00:21:50.029 --> 00:21:50.039 align:start position:0%
counted at the end of the night you
 
00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:56.510 --> 00:21:56.520 align:start position:0%
yes representative Kennedy
 
00:21:58.789 --> 00:21:58.799 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Vice chairman and thanks
 
00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh you began your
 
00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:03.240 align:start position:0%
testimony by saying you were speaking
 
00:22:04.549 --> 00:22:04.559 align:start position:0%
for yourself
 
00:22:06.770 --> 00:22:06.780 align:start position:0%
so you are not talking for any other
 
00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:08.940 align:start position:0%
clerk in the state
 
00:22:11.149 --> 00:22:11.159 align:start position:0%
I I am not
 
00:22:13.370 --> 00:22:13.380 align:start position:0%
um I am in
 
00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:15.480 align:start position:0%
um contact with the Windham Town Clerk
 
00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:20.700 align:start position:0%
and I know she feels the same way on on
 
00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:24.360 align:start position:0%
this but besides that I'm not speaking
 
00:22:27.289 --> 00:22:27.299 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the clerk's Association we
 
00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
didn't take an opinion on this bill
 
00:22:32.149 --> 00:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
um so I don't want to speak for them
 
00:22:34.130 --> 00:22:34.140 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
00:22:36.529 --> 00:22:36.539 align:start position:0%
yes representative Brennan thank you for
 
00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:39.900 align:start position:0%
taking my question are you aware of any
 
00:22:42.649 --> 00:22:42.659 align:start position:0%
instance where counting or tabulating
 
00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
has happened behind closed doors in a
 
00:22:48.169 --> 00:22:48.179 align:start position:0%
secret room or closet or anything like
 
00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:50.340 align:start position:0%
that have are you aware of any instance
 
00:22:52.669 --> 00:22:52.679 align:start position:0%
like that no and and that would that
 
00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:54.840 align:start position:0%
would violate it in our sale it has to
 
00:22:56.510 --> 00:22:56.520 align:start position:0%
be done into the guard rail in public
 
00:22:58.730 --> 00:22:58.740 align:start position:0%
view okay
 
00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
00:23:03.289 --> 00:23:03.299 align:start position:0%

else wish to speak on HB 243
[Music]

00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:07.260 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:10.390 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:14.210 --> 00:23:14.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:25.490 --> 00:23:25.500 align:start position:0%
I generally don't testify a second time
 
00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
but it is just a matter of correcting
 
00:23:30.049 --> 00:23:30.059 align:start position:0%
facts on the record
 
00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:31.980 align:start position:0%
I just sent everybody on the committee
 
00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:33.720 align:start position:0%
an email and I succeed Caitlyn that's
 
00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
why what I was desperately trying to
 
00:23:37.549 --> 00:23:37.559 align:start position:0%
type in
 
00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:41.220 align:start position:0%
it is a link to the press release on
 
00:23:43.789 --> 00:23:43.799 align:start position:0%
September 20 2022
 
00:23:46.909 --> 00:23:46.919 align:start position:0%
which was issued after town residents
 
00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:48.600 align:start position:0%
noticed the change in the election
 
00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
results that changed it you know and you
 
00:23:53.930 --> 00:23:53.940 align:start position:0%
can read it it is the press release that
 
00:23:56.450 --> 00:23:56.460 align:start position:0%
I refer to by uh you know pointing out
 
00:23:59.330 --> 00:23:59.340 align:start position:0%
to the Leslie Nielsen movie
 
00:24:02.330 --> 00:24:02.340 align:start position:0%
it basically says that um
 
00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:04.140 align:start position:0%
it's all good
 
00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:07.020 align:start position:0%
this is just a complex process and it's
 
00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:09.780 align:start position:0%
all good nothing to see here move along
 
00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
it uses different language
 
00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:14.940 align:start position:0%
the error was not found
 
00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:17.640 align:start position:0%
it was not investigated even after these
 
00:24:19.789 --> 00:24:19.799 align:start position:0%
results were brought to the attention of
 
00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:22.200 align:start position:0%
the Town officials nothing was done
 
00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
other than this press release
 
00:24:26.810 --> 00:24:26.820 align:start position:0%
at least nothing that was talked about
 
00:24:28.669 --> 00:24:28.679 align:start position:0%
publicly and God knows they should have
 
00:24:31.010 --> 00:24:31.020 align:start position:0%
until after the Secretary of State
 
00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:33.900 align:start position:0%
recount proved that the initial results
 
00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
published The Night of the election were
 
00:24:39.049 --> 00:24:39.059 align:start position:0%
correct and this was wrong
 
00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:43.260 align:start position:0%
then new press releases showed up this
 
00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:47.340 align:start position:0%
is all that the town saw until after the
 
00:24:49.789 --> 00:24:49.799 align:start position:0%
Secretary of the State recount I just
 
00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:51.240 align:start position:0%
want to have that fact on the record
 
00:24:53.810 --> 00:24:53.820 align:start position:0%
because statements were made to the
 
00:24:56.690 --> 00:24:56.700 align:start position:0%
contrary and this establishes facts so
 
00:24:58.430 --> 00:24:58.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:00.600 align:start position:0%
okay all right
 
00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
anyone else wishing to testify on this
 
00:25:05.029 --> 00:25:05.039 align:start position:0%
bill okay um representative what could
 
00:25:22.549 --> 00:25:22.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:25.549 --> 00:25:25.559 align:start position:0%
okay oops well that's just really easy
 
00:25:27.649 --> 00:25:27.659 align:start position:0%
um one person signed in and they were
 
00:25:29.149 --> 00:25:29.159 align:start position:0%
against it with that I'm going to close
 
00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
the public hearing for two HP 243 we
 
00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:35.640 align:start position:0%
will reconvene in seven minutes to do
 
00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:37.320 align:start position:0%
the public hearing for 244 and I'm gonna
 
00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
run to my car and get my cell phone so
 
00:26:28.610 --> 00:26:28.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:33.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:01.090 --> 00:32:01.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:03.950 --> 00:32:03.960 align:start position:0%
okay it's 10 30 so we're going to open
 
00:32:06.970 --> 00:32:06.980 align:start position:0%
up the hearing for our house bill 244
 
00:32:09.529 --> 00:32:09.539 align:start position:0%
relative to the printing of the election
 
00:32:12.289 --> 00:32:12.299 align:start position:0%
day checklist representative cutab is up
 
00:32:12.299 --> 00:32:20.210 align:start position:0%
day checklist representative cutab is up
again

00:32:20.210 --> 00:32:20.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Vice chairman for the
 
00:32:23.450 --> 00:32:23.460 align:start position:0%
record my name is representative Caitlin
 
00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:27.360 align:start position:0%
kutab and I represent Rockingham 17.
 
00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:28.669 align:start position:0%
kutab and I represent Rockingham 17.
so

00:32:28.669 --> 00:32:28.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:32.760 align:start position:0%
this bill seeks to do two things one
 
00:32:35.810 --> 00:32:35.820 align:start position:0%
it's clarifying the clerk
 
00:32:38.510 --> 00:32:38.520 align:start position:0%
shall mail verified absentee ballots
 
00:32:40.850 --> 00:32:40.860 align:start position:0%
until 12 pm on the day before the
 
00:32:43.549 --> 00:32:43.559 align:start position:0%
election instead of 5 PM
 
00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
I do think it's important to note that
 
00:32:48.049 --> 00:32:48.059 align:start position:0%
there are several towns who don't even
 
00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:52.980 align:start position:0%
have post office open until 5 PM and so
 
00:32:55.130 --> 00:32:55.140 align:start position:0%
I think we're disenfranchising voters a
 
00:32:56.630 --> 00:32:56.640 align:start position:0%
little bit to make them think that a
 
00:32:59.210 --> 00:32:59.220 align:start position:0%
ballot May reach them if they request it
 
00:33:03.169 --> 00:33:03.179 align:start position:0%
at 4 55 pm and
 
00:33:05.149 --> 00:33:05.159 align:start position:0%
the clerk is dropping it off at a post
 
00:33:07.730 --> 00:33:07.740 align:start position:0%
office that's already closed for the day
 
00:33:10.549 --> 00:33:10.559 align:start position:0%
so this isn't prohibiting them from
 
00:33:12.769 --> 00:33:12.779 align:start position:0%
going down to the town hall filling out
 
00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:14.640 align:start position:0%
their absentee ballot at the Town Hall
 
00:33:16.250 --> 00:33:16.260 align:start position:0%
that same day this is just saying that
 
00:33:18.529 --> 00:33:18.539 align:start position:0%
they don't have to mail them after that
 
00:33:18.539 --> 00:33:20.870 align:start position:0%
they don't have to mail them after that
point

00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:24.049 --> 00:33:24.059 align:start position:0%
further this is seeking to
 
00:33:26.509 --> 00:33:26.519 align:start position:0%
make the names of anybody who requested
 
00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
an absentee ballot on the voter
 
00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:29.630 align:start position:0%
an absentee ballot on the voter
checklist

00:33:29.630 --> 00:33:29.640 align:start position:0%
checklist
 
00:33:33.289 --> 00:33:33.299 align:start position:0%
to be bold that way anybody who is
 
00:33:36.289 --> 00:33:36.299 align:start position:0%
observing or or watching at the polls
 
00:33:38.930 --> 00:33:38.940 align:start position:0%
can see kind of from far away who has or
 
00:33:41.810 --> 00:33:41.820 align:start position:0%
hasn't requested an absentee ballot and
 
00:33:43.549 --> 00:33:43.559 align:start position:0%
they can they can watch that person and
 
00:33:45.409 --> 00:33:45.419 align:start position:0%
and make sure that things are being done
 
00:33:47.810 --> 00:33:47.820 align:start position:0%
fairly and accurately
 
00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:50.389 align:start position:0%
fairly and accurately
so

00:33:50.389 --> 00:33:50.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:33:53.570 --> 00:33:53.580 align:start position:0%
it makes it easier to audit it and it
 
00:33:56.029 --> 00:33:56.039 align:start position:0%
also prevents the case of
 
00:33:58.190 --> 00:33:58.200 align:start position:0%
somebody bringing in an absentee ballot
 
00:33:59.509 --> 00:33:59.519 align:start position:0%
with them and collecting another
 
00:34:01.669 --> 00:34:01.679 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot and putting it through
 
00:34:02.930 --> 00:34:02.940 align:start position:0%
the machine if you're not carefully
 
00:34:04.909 --> 00:34:04.919 align:start position:0%
watching them could pretty easily be
 
00:34:06.049 --> 00:34:06.059 align:start position:0%
done right
 
00:34:07.970 --> 00:34:07.980 align:start position:0%
so we just want to make sure that again
 
00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:14.810 --> 00:34:14.820 align:start position:0%
okay oh you've been taking questions yes
 
00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:16.020 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions questions
 
00:34:18.470 --> 00:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
00:34:20.930 --> 00:34:20.940 align:start position:0%
representative Muirhead thank you Mr
 
00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
chair what could could you repeat and
 
00:34:24.950 --> 00:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
explain again what could pretty easily
 
00:34:26.389 --> 00:34:26.399 align:start position:0%
be done
 
00:34:29.149 --> 00:34:29.159 align:start position:0%
so if I request an absentee ballot from
 
00:34:31.250 --> 00:34:31.260 align:start position:0%
the clerk they mail me one
 
00:34:33.829 --> 00:34:33.839 align:start position:0%
I can still go to the polls
 
00:34:36.950 --> 00:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:40.250 --> 00:34:40.260 align:start position:0%
and if I had mailed in my absentee
 
00:34:41.810 --> 00:34:41.820 align:start position:0%
ballot they would be checking at the end
 
00:34:43.490 --> 00:34:43.500 align:start position:0%
of the night to see
 
00:34:45.409 --> 00:34:45.419 align:start position:0%
was this mailed in and did the person
 
00:34:47.329 --> 00:34:47.339 align:start position:0%
come out to vote at the same time and if
 
00:34:49.669 --> 00:34:49.679 align:start position:0%
if that was the case they would remove
 
00:34:51.230 --> 00:34:51.240 align:start position:0%
my envelope from the stack and they
 
00:34:53.829 --> 00:34:53.839 align:start position:0%
wouldn't count it however if I just
 
00:34:55.970 --> 00:34:55.980 align:start position:0%
unfolded the ballot and I put it through
 
00:34:57.410 --> 00:34:57.420 align:start position:0%
the machine at the same time as my other
 
00:34:59.089 --> 00:34:59.099 align:start position:0%
ballot there are towns that do have
 
00:35:01.010 --> 00:35:01.020 align:start position:0%
multiple ballots you could put them both
 
00:35:02.450 --> 00:35:02.460 align:start position:0%
through what's to stop you from doing
 
00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:09.650 --> 00:35:09.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:11.640 align:start position:0%
do you have a question
 
00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:13.490 align:start position:0%
do you have a question
yes

00:35:13.490 --> 00:35:13.500 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:14.390 align:start position:0%
yes
um

00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:19.250 --> 00:35:19.260 align:start position:0%
well thank you for taking my question
 
00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:21.349 align:start position:0%
well thank you for taking my question
so

00:35:21.349 --> 00:35:21.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:35:24.349 --> 00:35:24.359 align:start position:0%
well I guess I have two questions so
 
00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:28.680 align:start position:0%
in our ward in our town it would be
 
00:35:31.490 --> 00:35:31.500 align:start position:0%
impossible for somebody to put two
 
00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:33.960 align:start position:0%
ballots into the machine
 
00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
at the same time the clerk who's
 
00:35:38.089 --> 00:35:38.099 align:start position:0%
standing the clerk of the Monterey who's
 
00:35:39.650 --> 00:35:39.660 align:start position:0%
standing at the machine watches very
 
00:35:42.589 --> 00:35:42.599 align:start position:0%
carefully so all right my second real
 
00:35:44.930 --> 00:35:44.940 align:start position:0%
question is
 
00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:46.569 align:start position:0%
question is
um

00:35:46.569 --> 00:35:46.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:49.130 --> 00:35:49.140 align:start position:0%
it sounds like the way this is worded
 
00:35:53.210 --> 00:35:53.220 align:start position:0%
that if your name is bolded for having
 
00:35:55.609 --> 00:35:55.619 align:start position:0%
had an absentee ballot mailed to you
 
00:35:58.310 --> 00:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
that you would then not be allowed to
 
00:35:59.870 --> 00:35:59.880 align:start position:0%
vote in person
 
00:36:09.770 --> 00:36:09.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:13.010 --> 00:36:13.020 align:start position:0%
so right now they currently place an an
 
00:36:15.770 --> 00:36:15.780 align:start position:0%
AV next to the person's name this is
 
00:36:18.770 --> 00:36:18.780 align:start position:0%
just saying that they're gonna bold the
 
00:36:21.470 --> 00:36:21.480 align:start position:0%
name to make it more easily seen by the
 
00:36:26.630 --> 00:36:26.640 align:start position:0%
people that are observing or watching so
 
00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
I don't believe that that's the that
 
00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
that's the way that it's currently done
 
00:36:35.270 --> 00:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
um I believe right now if you haven't
 
00:36:36.829 --> 00:36:36.839 align:start position:0%
at the end of the night what they do is
 
00:36:39.290 --> 00:36:39.300 align:start position:0%
they check to see if you have a mailed
 
00:36:41.690 --> 00:36:41.700 align:start position:0%
in ballot and if you came in that same
 
00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
day then they just don't count your mail
 
00:36:46.730 --> 00:36:46.740 align:start position:0%
then ballot and I I heard what you said
 
00:36:48.109 --> 00:36:48.119 align:start position:0%
about your town and I think for some
 
00:36:49.609 --> 00:36:49.619 align:start position:0%
small towns where they maybe only have
 
00:36:51.050 --> 00:36:51.060 align:start position:0%
one machine and the clerk can carefully
 
00:36:53.270 --> 00:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
watch that's certainly doable but you
 
00:36:54.650 --> 00:36:54.660 align:start position:0%
know we had Representatives here talking
 
00:36:56.569 --> 00:36:56.579 align:start position:0%
about five different polling locations
 
00:36:58.250 --> 00:36:58.260 align:start position:0%
eight different polling locations we
 
00:37:00.290 --> 00:37:00.300 align:start position:0%
can't have a clerk obviously in each one
 
00:37:02.329 --> 00:37:02.339 align:start position:0%
that's carefully watching a lot of times
 
00:37:05.930 --> 00:37:05.940 align:start position:0%
they're volunteers that are watching so
 
00:37:08.270 --> 00:37:08.280 align:start position:0%
representative Brennan
 
00:37:09.770 --> 00:37:09.780 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
00:37:13.609 --> 00:37:13.619 align:start position:0%
question on line 22 of this bill
 
00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
um which is unchanged it says the names
 
00:37:18.770 --> 00:37:18.780 align:start position:0%
of all voters who have requested an
 
00:37:21.770 --> 00:37:21.780 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot shall be printed in bold
 
00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:23.210 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot shall be printed in bold
so

00:37:23.210 --> 00:37:23.220 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:37:26.510 --> 00:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
this is already happening in towns and
 
00:37:28.849 --> 00:37:28.859 align:start position:0%
municipalities that someone who requests
 
00:37:29.930 --> 00:37:29.940 align:start position:0%
about it
 
00:37:32.770 --> 00:37:32.780 align:start position:0%
is printed in bold already and then
 
00:37:36.890 --> 00:37:36.900 align:start position:0%
when they mail back their ballot the red
 
00:37:40.910 --> 00:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
ink AV marks that they have actually
 
00:37:44.210 --> 00:37:44.220 align:start position:0%
cast their ballot so am I understanding
 
00:37:45.950 --> 00:37:45.960 align:start position:0%
this correctly that
 
00:37:50.290 --> 00:37:50.300 align:start position:0%
just by requesting a ballot but not
 
00:37:53.710 --> 00:37:53.720 align:start position:0%
necessarily returning that ballot
 
00:37:56.690 --> 00:37:56.700 align:start position:0%
that a voter would be prohibited from
 
00:37:58.670 --> 00:37:58.680 align:start position:0%
voting in person
 
00:38:00.650 --> 00:38:00.660 align:start position:0%
on Election Day
 
00:38:02.450 --> 00:38:02.460 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna pause you right there
 
00:38:03.890 --> 00:38:03.900 align:start position:0%
representative representative Brennan
 
00:38:05.810 --> 00:38:05.820 align:start position:0%
your question is very valid
 
00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:07.010 align:start position:0%
your question is very valid
um

00:38:07.010 --> 00:38:07.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:08.270 --> 00:38:08.280 align:start position:0%
representative Ward and I were
 
00:38:09.710 --> 00:38:09.720 align:start position:0%
discussing it looks like that's a change
 
00:38:12.109 --> 00:38:12.119 align:start position:0%
in the bill to the existing RSA I'm
 
00:38:13.609 --> 00:38:13.619 align:start position:0%
looking it up right now
 
00:38:16.670 --> 00:38:16.680 align:start position:0%
um 254 26.
 
00:38:18.050 --> 00:38:18.060 align:start position:0%
um so I'll just read it just to kind of
 
00:38:19.910 --> 00:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
clarify I think this is an error not I
 
00:38:22.130 --> 00:38:22.140 align:start position:0%
think this is an uh it was repealed
 
00:38:24.170 --> 00:38:24.180 align:start position:0%
previously so it's reenacting it so it's
 
00:38:25.970 --> 00:38:25.980 align:start position:0%
reenacting it okay so I think that's
 
00:38:28.970 --> 00:38:28.980 align:start position:0%
supposed to be bold in the bill in the
 
00:38:31.609 --> 00:38:31.619 align:start position:0%
bill because the current RSA at least as
 
00:38:33.170 --> 00:38:33.180 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at it right now make sure
 
00:38:34.970 --> 00:38:34.980 align:start position:0%
before I really just put my foot in my
 
00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:36.470 align:start position:0%
before I really just put my foot in my
mouth

00:38:36.470 --> 00:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
mouth
 
00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:38.030 align:start position:0%
mouth
um

00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:38.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:40.069 --> 00:38:40.079 align:start position:0%
just looking at two different it doesn't
 
00:38:44.750 --> 00:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:47.450 --> 00:38:47.460 align:start position:0%
it does yeah so OLS said that in the
 
00:38:49.550 --> 00:38:49.560 align:start position:0%
case of something that's like a whole
 
00:38:51.650 --> 00:38:51.660 align:start position:0%
new section they don't bold it they just
 
00:38:53.630 --> 00:38:53.640 align:start position:0%
note that that would be a new section
 
00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
they don't bold the whole thing they
 
00:38:56.930 --> 00:38:56.940 align:start position:0%
only bold it when you're changing like a
 
00:38:58.250 --> 00:38:58.260 align:start position:0%
small amount in it or if it's too
 
00:38:59.630 --> 00:38:59.640 align:start position:0%
confusing they don't bold the whole
 
00:39:01.130 --> 00:39:01.140 align:start position:0%
thing yeah so there's certain
 
00:39:02.810 --> 00:39:02.820 align:start position:0%
circumstances which I guess they do or
 
00:39:04.849 --> 00:39:04.859 align:start position:0%
don't yeah they probably but that is a
 
00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:06.720 align:start position:0%
new that is an entirely new section so
 
00:39:08.930 --> 00:39:08.940 align:start position:0%
that's a new it's a new
 
00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
is it there
 
00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:16.010 --> 00:39:16.020 align:start position:0%
yeah they just didn't really do a good
 
00:39:17.329 --> 00:39:17.339 align:start position:0%
job of it okay sorry about the reason
 
00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:18.720 align:start position:0%
you want to ask your question before I
 
00:39:20.450 --> 00:39:20.460 align:start position:0%
sort of rudely interrupted you um I just
 
00:39:21.410 --> 00:39:21.420 align:start position:0%
want to make sure we're all on the same
 
00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:22.370 align:start position:0%
want to make sure we're all on the same
page

00:39:22.370 --> 00:39:22.380 align:start position:0%
page
 
00:39:25.609 --> 00:39:25.619 align:start position:0%
thank you I just want to make sure that
 
00:39:27.849 --> 00:39:27.859 align:start position:0%
I'm understanding this bill correctly
 
00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:31.560 align:start position:0%
that someone who has requested a ballot
 
00:39:35.210 --> 00:39:35.220 align:start position:0%
but has not turned that ballot in
 
00:39:38.450 --> 00:39:38.460 align:start position:0%
will not be turned away at the polling
 
00:39:40.250 --> 00:39:40.260 align:start position:0%
place because
 
00:39:42.829 --> 00:39:42.839 align:start position:0%
you're a mom I'm a mom plans change
 
00:39:45.290 --> 00:39:45.300 align:start position:0%
right so I want to make sure that
 
00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:47.880 align:start position:0%
someone who has not
 
00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
um returned their ballot simply because
 
00:39:51.650 --> 00:39:51.660 align:start position:0%
their plans have changed and they want
 
00:39:53.870 --> 00:39:53.880 align:start position:0%
to make sure their vote is counted they
 
00:39:57.349 --> 00:39:57.359 align:start position:0%
show up on Election Day that they will
 
00:40:00.050 --> 00:40:00.060 align:start position:0%
still have the opportunity to vote can
 
00:40:03.650 --> 00:40:03.660 align:start position:0%
you just explain how this changed this
 
00:40:06.349 --> 00:40:06.359 align:start position:0%
particular change will impact real world
 
00:40:09.050 --> 00:40:09.060 align:start position:0%
situations yeah so that wasn't the
 
00:40:10.609 --> 00:40:10.619 align:start position:0%
intention and actually the way I'm
 
00:40:12.109 --> 00:40:12.119 align:start position:0%
reading it is kind of similar to how
 
00:40:14.210 --> 00:40:14.220 align:start position:0%
you're reading it and I think
 
00:40:16.730 --> 00:40:16.740 align:start position:0%
currently it it does say that although I
 
00:40:17.930 --> 00:40:17.940 align:start position:0%
don't think it's actually happening so I
 
00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
think it should be fixed and I'm happy
 
00:40:21.170 --> 00:40:21.180 align:start position:0%
to put in an amendment for that the
 
00:40:22.970 --> 00:40:22.980 align:start position:0%
purpose was just to bold the name so
 
00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:24.720 align:start position:0%
that again when people were watching at
 
00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
the polls
 
00:40:28.910 --> 00:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
they could just be you know making sure
 
00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:29.930 align:start position:0%
they could just be you know making sure
that

00:40:29.930 --> 00:40:29.940 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:40:31.609 --> 00:40:31.619 align:start position:0%
the person was only turning in one
 
00:40:33.710 --> 00:40:33.720 align:start position:0%
ballot and yes I agree sometimes plans
 
00:40:36.650 --> 00:40:36.660 align:start position:0%
change and somebody may need to vote in
 
00:40:40.069 --> 00:40:40.079 align:start position:0%
person at the time and so I think
 
00:40:42.829 --> 00:40:42.839 align:start position:0%
though it does read like that although I
 
00:40:44.569 --> 00:40:44.579 align:start position:0%
didn't think of it that way only because
 
00:40:45.650 --> 00:40:45.660 align:start position:0%
that's not what's currently being
 
00:40:47.870 --> 00:40:47.880 align:start position:0%
practiced so I do think even with the
 
00:40:50.089 --> 00:40:50.099 align:start position:0%
the red AV on there as well which I
 
00:40:51.829 --> 00:40:51.839 align:start position:0%
think you can't see from as far away I
 
00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
certainly don't want to turn away voters
 
00:40:54.890 --> 00:40:54.900 align:start position:0%
in that case either so I do I do think
 
00:40:56.089 --> 00:40:56.099 align:start position:0%
that that should be clarified and I'm
 
00:40:59.030 --> 00:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
happy to put in an amendment with OLS
 
00:41:01.750 --> 00:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:04.430 --> 00:41:04.440 align:start position:0%
representative Muirhead thank you Mr
 
00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:05.690 align:start position:0%
representative Muirhead thank you Mr
chair

00:41:05.690 --> 00:41:05.700 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:41:07.250 --> 00:41:07.260 align:start position:0%
um on this section that we're discussing
 
00:41:11.329 --> 00:41:11.339 align:start position:0%
which is lines uh 20 to 23
 
00:41:13.569 --> 00:41:13.579 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
00:41:17.569 --> 00:41:17.579 align:start position:0%
my reading is that the current law
 
00:41:20.030 --> 00:41:20.040 align:start position:0%
um well it says that the uh
 
00:41:22.310 --> 00:41:22.320 align:start position:0%
the the supervisor shall make and post
 
00:41:25.069 --> 00:41:25.079 align:start position:0%
copies of the current checklist
 
00:41:27.230 --> 00:41:27.240 align:start position:0%
of the office of the town or city clerk
 
00:41:29.390 --> 00:41:29.400 align:start position:0%
or at Town Hall
 
00:41:31.609 --> 00:41:31.619 align:start position:0%
not later than the fourth Tuesday before
 
00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:33.000 align:start position:0%
the day
 
00:41:35.930 --> 00:41:35.940 align:start position:0%
of any state election
 
00:41:38.690 --> 00:41:38.700 align:start position:0%
and this one this bill deletes that
 
00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:40.440 align:start position:0%
repeals it
 
00:41:42.109 --> 00:41:42.119 align:start position:0%
and says that the checklist shall be
 
00:41:42.119 --> 00:41:43.210 align:start position:0%
and says that the checklist shall be
posted

00:41:43.210 --> 00:41:43.220 align:start position:0%
posted
 
00:41:46.069 --> 00:41:46.079 align:start position:0%
no sooner than 12 p.m on the Monday
 
00:41:49.130 --> 00:41:49.140 align:start position:0%
before the election so that would be
 
00:41:52.490 --> 00:41:52.500 align:start position:0%
less than 24 hours before polls open
 
00:41:56.530 --> 00:41:56.540 align:start position:0%
that's a major change in in the law
 
00:41:59.750 --> 00:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
and that this list that's published on
 
00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:01.800 align:start position:0%
the Monday before the election
 
00:42:04.250 --> 00:42:04.260 align:start position:0%
would include all the names of people
 
00:42:06.410 --> 00:42:06.420 align:start position:0%
requesting an absentee ballot and in
 
00:42:06.420 --> 00:42:07.190 align:start position:0%
requesting an absentee ballot and in
bold

00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:07.200 align:start position:0%
bold
 
00:42:09.770 --> 00:42:09.780 align:start position:0%
would that allow would-be thieves to
 
00:42:11.810 --> 00:42:11.820 align:start position:0%
check the to check to see whose
 
00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:14.640 align:start position:0%
requested an absentee ballot in order to
 
00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
determine which homes in a town might be
 
00:42:19.609 --> 00:42:19.619 align:start position:0%
empty and which homes might be right
 
00:42:25.010 --> 00:42:25.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:26.990 --> 00:42:27.000 align:start position:0%
well I think that if you're posting it
 
00:42:30.170 --> 00:42:30.180 align:start position:0%
way in advance that would be
 
00:42:32.450 --> 00:42:32.460 align:start position:0%
kind of offering the same thing as if
 
00:42:34.130 --> 00:42:34.140 align:start position:0%
you posted it soon or two it would give
 
00:42:37.670 --> 00:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
a less opportunity to do so
 
00:42:41.329 --> 00:42:41.339 align:start position:0%
and I I have heard from some of the the
 
00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
clerks that that they would
 
00:42:46.849 --> 00:42:46.859 align:start position:0%
like to allow for the posting to be a
 
00:42:49.970 --> 00:42:49.980 align:start position:0%
little bit sooner and perhaps to
 
00:42:49.980 --> 00:42:51.109 align:start position:0%
little bit sooner and perhaps to
um

00:42:51.109 --> 00:42:51.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:52.849 --> 00:42:52.859 align:start position:0%
highlight the name or some or something
 
00:42:54.530 --> 00:42:54.540 align:start position:0%
different in the meantime just in the
 
00:42:55.790 --> 00:42:55.800 align:start position:0%
case of
 
00:42:57.950 --> 00:42:57.960 align:start position:0%
having the time to prepare the checklist
 
00:43:00.410 --> 00:43:00.420 align:start position:0%
and I'm certainly amenable to that I
 
00:43:02.809 --> 00:43:02.819 align:start position:0%
just this this just seeks to be more
 
00:43:05.089 --> 00:43:05.099 align:start position:0%
transparent in the process that's that's
 
00:43:08.990 --> 00:43:09.000 align:start position:0%
the purpose of it and I you know
 
00:43:10.430 --> 00:43:10.440 align:start position:0%
I do think
 
00:43:12.410 --> 00:43:12.420 align:start position:0%
currently like us having that we send
 
00:43:14.870 --> 00:43:14.880 align:start position:0%
them out until 5 PM the ballots we're
 
00:43:17.150 --> 00:43:17.160 align:start position:0%
telling people that in this RSA we're
 
00:43:19.550 --> 00:43:19.560 align:start position:0%
kind of implying that you actually may
 
00:43:21.349 --> 00:43:21.359 align:start position:0%
receive your ballot and in several towns
 
00:43:22.910 --> 00:43:22.920 align:start position:0%
we know that the post office isn't even
 
00:43:24.829 --> 00:43:24.839 align:start position:0%
open so why would we even apply to the
 
00:43:27.170 --> 00:43:27.180 align:start position:0%
voters that it may when it's completely
 
00:43:28.609 --> 00:43:28.619 align:start position:0%
impossible that they're going to get the
 
00:43:28.619 --> 00:43:29.870 align:start position:0%
impossible that they're going to get the
ballot

00:43:29.870 --> 00:43:29.880 align:start position:0%
ballot
 
00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:31.069 align:start position:0%
ballot
um

00:43:31.069 --> 00:43:31.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:32.870 --> 00:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
I think we're just enfranchising those
 
00:43:36.950 --> 00:43:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:40.550 --> 00:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
beautiful thank you thank you
 
00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
no thank you no thank you okay sorry uh
 
00:43:44.510 --> 00:43:44.520 align:start position:0%
representative Lane
 
00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:45.530 align:start position:0%
representative Lane
you

00:43:45.530 --> 00:43:45.540 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:43:45.540 --> 00:43:46.190 align:start position:0%
you
um

00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:46.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:48.720 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna follow up along the same line
 
00:43:51.470 --> 00:43:51.480 align:start position:0%
that representative mirror had had so
 
00:43:53.690 --> 00:43:53.700 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm curious about the change about
 
00:43:57.050 --> 00:43:57.060 align:start position:0%
not later than the fourth Tuesday to not
 
00:43:59.390 --> 00:43:59.400 align:start position:0%
later than 12 p.m on the Monday before
 
00:44:03.050 --> 00:44:03.060 align:start position:0%
the election and why what was the
 
00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
purpose of that so the purpose was so
 
00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
that the names of anybody who had
 
00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:09.349 align:start position:0%
that the names of anybody who had
requested

00:44:09.349 --> 00:44:09.359 align:start position:0%
requested
 
00:44:13.550 --> 00:44:13.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:13.560 --> 00:44:16.670 align:start position:0%
 
yep

00:44:16.670 --> 00:44:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:16.680 --> 00:44:20.390 align:start position:0%
 
today

00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:23.210 --> 00:44:23.220 align:start position:0%
you have to register to vote a month
 
00:44:25.550 --> 00:44:25.560 align:start position:0%
before and if you don't then you have to
 
00:44:28.670 --> 00:44:28.680 align:start position:0%
do same-day election so I'm not sure
 
00:44:31.370 --> 00:44:31.380 align:start position:0%
that anybody I'm just wondering if
 
00:44:34.430 --> 00:44:34.440 align:start position:0%
that's why they do that I and it and you
 
00:44:36.050 --> 00:44:36.060 align:start position:0%
may not know the answer to that but I
 
00:44:37.609 --> 00:44:37.619 align:start position:0%
think that's something I want to find
 
00:44:40.069 --> 00:44:40.079 align:start position:0%
out because it is a big change to do it
 
00:44:43.790 --> 00:44:43.800 align:start position:0%
yeah so I'd be fine changing it to say
 
00:44:46.250 --> 00:44:46.260 align:start position:0%
um you know instead of Bolding it if
 
00:44:47.930 --> 00:44:47.940 align:start position:0%
they printed it out but highlighted the
 
00:44:50.089 --> 00:44:50.099 align:start position:0%
names that would also be fine
 
00:44:53.210 --> 00:44:53.220 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted it to be again obvious
 
00:44:55.370 --> 00:44:55.380 align:start position:0%
who had requested these absentee ballots
 
00:44:58.910 --> 00:44:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:01.130 --> 00:45:01.140 align:start position:0%
members of the bank
 
00:45:03.109 --> 00:45:03.119 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:45:05.210 --> 00:45:05.220 align:start position:0%
my question this is actually a follow-up
 
00:45:06.829 --> 00:45:06.839 align:start position:0%
question on something that was mentioned
 
00:45:10.309 --> 00:45:10.319 align:start position:0%
earlier about those Sinister voters who
 
00:45:12.650 --> 00:45:12.660 align:start position:0%
tried to vote twice so are you referring
 
00:45:16.849 --> 00:45:16.859 align:start position:0%
to actually uh bringing in the absentee
 
00:45:18.770 --> 00:45:18.780 align:start position:0%
ballot that was requested to the mail
 
00:45:22.609 --> 00:45:22.619 align:start position:0%
and getting another ballot and so you're
 
00:45:25.309 --> 00:45:25.319 align:start position:0%
not referring to uh those people who
 
00:45:27.470 --> 00:45:27.480 align:start position:0%
might have already sent in their field
 
00:45:30.250 --> 00:45:30.260 align:start position:0%
ballot and showing up at the
 
00:45:32.930 --> 00:45:32.940 align:start position:0%
no so the second case is already covered
 
00:45:34.849 --> 00:45:34.859 align:start position:0%
because they do they do go through and
 
00:45:36.530 --> 00:45:36.540 align:start position:0%
see if you came that day at the end of
 
00:45:38.329 --> 00:45:38.339 align:start position:0%
the night so that case is already
 
00:45:40.430 --> 00:45:40.440 align:start position:0%
accounted for but what's not accounted
 
00:45:42.470 --> 00:45:42.480 align:start position:0%
for would be in the case of large
 
00:45:44.150 --> 00:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
polling places
 
00:45:45.770 --> 00:45:45.780 align:start position:0%
somebody putting through two ballots
 
00:45:48.589 --> 00:45:48.599 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:45:50.750 --> 00:45:50.760 align:start position:0%
further questions from the community
 
00:45:53.390 --> 00:45:53.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question did you
 
00:45:55.550 --> 00:45:55.560 align:start position:0%
know when Manchester has 12 polling
 
00:45:55.560 --> 00:45:56.569 align:start position:0%
know when Manchester has 12 polling
spots

00:45:56.569 --> 00:45:56.579 align:start position:0%
spots
 
00:45:59.569 --> 00:45:59.579 align:start position:0%
and in those polling spots we have three
 
00:46:02.870 --> 00:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
Selectmen one wood clerk one moderator
 
00:46:06.170 --> 00:46:06.180 align:start position:0%
and numerous ballot inspectors they're
 
00:46:09.589 --> 00:46:09.599 align:start position:0%
all there to watch the ballots go in the
 
00:46:11.030 --> 00:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
machine so
 
00:46:14.329 --> 00:46:14.339 align:start position:0%
how could anybody put in two ballots
 
00:46:16.609 --> 00:46:16.619 align:start position:0%
so I agree that in some places they're
 
00:46:18.470 --> 00:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
well staffed and it would be unlikely to
 
00:46:20.569 --> 00:46:20.579 align:start position:0%
happen but that's not the case in all of
 
00:46:22.790 --> 00:46:22.800 align:start position:0%
the towns having
 
00:46:24.710 --> 00:46:24.720 align:start position:0%
a person standing at each of those
 
00:46:26.329 --> 00:46:26.339 align:start position:0%
machines it's just it's it's different
 
00:46:31.069 --> 00:46:31.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:33.770 --> 00:46:33.780 align:start position:0%
resume your head thank you Mr chair you
 
00:46:35.510 --> 00:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
testified this morning that it'd be very
 
00:46:37.970 --> 00:46:37.980 align:start position:0%
easy for someone to vote twice to put
 
00:46:39.650 --> 00:46:39.660 align:start position:0%
two ballots in
 
00:46:42.589 --> 00:46:42.599 align:start position:0%
and and I just don't understand how it
 
00:46:44.569 --> 00:46:44.579 align:start position:0%
be anything other than very difficult
 
00:46:47.809 --> 00:46:47.819 align:start position:0%
for a voter to submit two ballots while
 
00:46:50.030 --> 00:46:50.040 align:start position:0%
the moderator clerk is watching the
 
00:46:53.150 --> 00:46:53.160 align:start position:0%
machine into which you submit the ballot
 
00:46:54.890 --> 00:46:54.900 align:start position:0%
could you explain again how it'd be very
 
00:46:54.900 --> 00:46:55.970 align:start position:0%
could you explain again how it'd be very
easy

00:46:55.970 --> 00:46:55.980 align:start position:0%
easy
 
00:46:59.390 --> 00:46:59.400 align:start position:0%
so my moderator isn't isn't standing
 
00:47:02.569 --> 00:47:02.579 align:start position:0%
there watching he actually is sitting
 
00:47:04.309 --> 00:47:04.319 align:start position:0%
down across the room
 
00:47:04.319 --> 00:47:05.630 align:start position:0%
down across the room
um

00:47:05.630 --> 00:47:05.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:07.609 --> 00:47:07.619 align:start position:0%
but I mean I guess the only way I could
 
00:47:08.990 --> 00:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
show you how easy it would be would be
 
00:47:10.309 --> 00:47:10.319 align:start position:0%
to put a blank ballot through the
 
00:47:12.290 --> 00:47:12.300 align:start position:0%
machine and right on the top blank
 
00:47:13.910 --> 00:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
ballot for the purposes of demonstrating
 
00:47:15.410 --> 00:47:15.420 align:start position:0%
because otherwise it would be illegal
 
00:47:19.089 --> 00:47:19.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:22.190 --> 00:47:22.200 align:start position:0%
all right seeing no more questions uh
 
00:47:25.069 --> 00:47:25.079 align:start position:0%
well thank you representative catab next
 
00:47:26.690 --> 00:47:26.700 align:start position:0%
up representative
 
00:47:29.630 --> 00:47:29.640 align:start position:0%
um Popovich Mueller did I get closer
 
00:47:30.950 --> 00:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
that time
 
00:47:33.950 --> 00:47:33.960 align:start position:0%
I feel like I was close
 
00:47:36.530 --> 00:47:36.540 align:start position:0%
it's about a 9 out of ten and by the end
 
00:47:38.270 --> 00:47:38.280 align:start position:0%
of the day you will be at 10 with
 
00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:40.790 align:start position:0%
of the day you will be at 10 with
practice

00:47:40.790 --> 00:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:43.010 --> 00:47:43.020 align:start position:0%
I just want you to take one minute to
 
00:47:45.050 --> 00:47:45.060 align:start position:0%
talk about the intent of this bill
 
00:47:46.849 --> 00:47:46.859 align:start position:0%
because the first question that I asked
 
00:47:48.589 --> 00:47:48.599 align:start position:0%
the representative Carter when she
 
00:47:51.170 --> 00:47:51.180 align:start position:0%
showed me the bill was
 
00:47:53.450 --> 00:47:53.460 align:start position:0%
how can we make sure that no voter gets
 
00:47:55.250 --> 00:47:55.260 align:start position:0%
disenfranchised by this bill because
 
00:47:57.829 --> 00:47:57.839 align:start position:0%
obviously you are you know saying that
 
00:48:00.650 --> 00:48:00.660 align:start position:0%
it's now no longer mandatory for the
 
00:48:03.770 --> 00:48:03.780 align:start position:0%
clerk to send absentee ballots uh until
 
00:48:06.349 --> 00:48:06.359 align:start position:0%
5 PM you are moving it to 12 technically
 
00:48:08.150 --> 00:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
there is a possibility of people asking
 
00:48:09.890 --> 00:48:09.900 align:start position:0%
at the last moment
 
00:48:09.900 --> 00:48:11.329 align:start position:0%
at the last moment
so

00:48:11.329 --> 00:48:11.339 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:48:14.030 --> 00:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
the issue with you know 5 PM as
 
00:48:17.030 --> 00:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
representative kotep said is that you
 
00:48:18.589 --> 00:48:18.599 align:start position:0%
may be physically and able to do it
 
00:48:20.809 --> 00:48:20.819 align:start position:0%
clerks you know receiver request at the
 
00:48:22.430 --> 00:48:22.440 align:start position:0%
last moment there is no time to actually
 
00:48:25.210 --> 00:48:25.220 align:start position:0%
do that and creating that expectation is
 
00:48:28.010 --> 00:48:28.020 align:start position:0%
dangerous because we're putting voters
 
00:48:30.530 --> 00:48:30.540 align:start position:0%
in a position where they exert their
 
00:48:32.329 --> 00:48:32.339 align:start position:0%
laws it know the rights according to the
 
00:48:35.630 --> 00:48:35.640 align:start position:0%
law and it doesn't work that way
 
00:48:38.270 --> 00:48:38.280 align:start position:0%
um in regards to the copies of the
 
00:48:40.910 --> 00:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
current checklist the intent of changing
 
00:48:42.829 --> 00:48:42.839 align:start position:0%
the time when they should be posted was
 
00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:44.640 align:start position:0%
to make sure that all the requests for
 
00:48:47.270 --> 00:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
absentee's ballots were received at the
 
00:48:49.790 --> 00:48:49.800 align:start position:0%
time when the checklist was printed so
 
00:48:51.589 --> 00:48:51.599 align:start position:0%
that when the checklist is printed
 
00:48:53.750 --> 00:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
everybody who has an absentee ballot is
 
00:48:55.970 --> 00:48:55.980 align:start position:0%
properly marked so it's clear to all the
 
00:48:57.890 --> 00:48:57.900 align:start position:0%
volunteers that run our polling stations
 
00:48:59.950 --> 00:48:59.960 align:start position:0%
and give ballots you know who's
 
00:49:03.530 --> 00:49:03.540 align:start position:0%
requested an absentee ballot or not I
 
00:49:06.730 --> 00:49:06.740 align:start position:0%
cannot comment on How likely it is for a
 
00:49:09.770 --> 00:49:09.780 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot that was mailed but not
 
00:49:12.230 --> 00:49:12.240 align:start position:0%
returned to the clerk to find its way
 
00:49:14.950 --> 00:49:14.960 align:start position:0%
into the you know
 
00:49:17.390 --> 00:49:17.400 align:start position:0%
machines but
 
00:49:20.630 --> 00:49:20.640 align:start position:0%
given the huge variety of setups you
 
00:49:22.670 --> 00:49:22.680 align:start position:0%
know with all the towns trying to meet
 
00:49:25.130 --> 00:49:25.140 align:start position:0%
their legal requirements it's very hard
 
00:49:26.809 --> 00:49:26.819 align:start position:0%
to say that that's not possible I mean
 
00:49:28.849 --> 00:49:28.859 align:start position:0%
when I vote for the town I have three
 
00:49:30.349 --> 00:49:30.359 align:start position:0%
different ballots right each of them
 
00:49:32.030 --> 00:49:32.040 align:start position:0%
with a different color
 
00:49:34.970 --> 00:49:34.980 align:start position:0%
you know I've been known to put one in a
 
00:49:36.650 --> 00:49:36.660 align:start position:0%
machine and one in another machine and
 
00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:38.640 align:start position:0%
if you move around a little you know you
 
00:49:40.490 --> 00:49:40.500 align:start position:0%
can come you can see a scenario whether
 
00:49:42.650 --> 00:49:42.660 align:start position:0%
it's possible I you know cannot say
 
00:49:44.829 --> 00:49:44.839 align:start position:0%
likely I cannot comment on how you know
 
00:49:48.190 --> 00:49:48.200 align:start position:0%
possible that is but it's just
 
00:49:51.410 --> 00:49:51.420 align:start position:0%
healthy to ensure that those absentee
 
00:49:53.270 --> 00:49:53.280 align:start position:0%
ballots that were sent out are accounted
 
00:49:55.010 --> 00:49:55.020 align:start position:0%
for in one way or the other whenever
 
00:49:55.020 --> 00:49:56.150 align:start position:0%
for in one way or the other whenever
possible

00:49:56.150 --> 00:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
possible
 
00:49:56.160 --> 00:49:58.550 align:start position:0%
possible
and

00:49:58.550 --> 00:49:58.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:50:02.030 --> 00:50:02.040 align:start position:0%
let's see no I think that was all that I
 
00:50:04.010 --> 00:50:04.020 align:start position:0%
really wanted to cover and I'm trying to
 
00:50:06.170 --> 00:50:06.180 align:start position:0%
keep it short so thank you
 
00:50:08.089 --> 00:50:08.099 align:start position:0%
questions on the committee
 
00:50:10.370 --> 00:50:10.380 align:start position:0%
okay none thank you
 
00:50:19.790 --> 00:50:19.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:21.410 --> 00:50:21.420 align:start position:0%
good morning members of the committee
 
00:50:25.309 --> 00:50:25.319 align:start position:0%
Dan Healy Nashua city clerk representing
 
00:50:26.990 --> 00:50:27.000 align:start position:0%

Association

00:50:28.430 --> 00:50:28.440 align:start position:0%
Association
 
00:50:31.670 --> 00:50:31.680 align:start position:0%
so we are opposed to this bill uh for
 
00:50:34.250 --> 00:50:34.260 align:start position:0%
the reason of printing the checklist and
 
00:50:37.030 --> 00:50:37.040 align:start position:0%
having it available on that Monday
 
00:50:40.130 --> 00:50:40.140 align:start position:0%
that's simply it's not enough time for
 
00:50:43.069 --> 00:50:43.079 align:start position:0%
our office to get you know
 
00:50:45.950 --> 00:50:45.960 align:start position:0%
I have nine Wards I have nine checklists
 
00:50:47.809 --> 00:50:47.819 align:start position:0%
that I would need to print we start
 
00:50:49.670 --> 00:50:49.680 align:start position:0%
printing after the supervisors of the
 
00:50:51.170 --> 00:50:51.180 align:start position:0%
checklist of the board of registrars
 
00:50:53.690 --> 00:50:53.700 align:start position:0%
have their session because it takes a
 
00:50:56.329 --> 00:50:56.339 align:start position:0%
long time to print say five six hundred
 
00:50:59.030 --> 00:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
pages and then the same checklist that
 
00:51:01.130 --> 00:51:01.140 align:start position:0%
we would post to the lobby has to go to
 
00:51:02.510 --> 00:51:02.520 align:start position:0%
the polling place so you have to
 
00:51:04.670 --> 00:51:04.680 align:start position:0%
separate that out you know a through C
 
00:51:06.950 --> 00:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
or whatever my clerks are doing that
 
00:51:09.349 --> 00:51:09.359 align:start position:0%
over the course of the days leading up
 
00:51:11.870 --> 00:51:11.880 align:start position:0%
to the election because they're also
 
00:51:14.530 --> 00:51:14.540 align:start position:0%
they're giving out absentee ballots and
 
00:51:17.450 --> 00:51:17.460 align:start position:0%
doing other things at the window they
 
00:51:19.730 --> 00:51:19.740 align:start position:0%
you know separate the checklist
 
00:51:23.870 --> 00:51:23.880 align:start position:0%
um as they can throughout the day so 12
 
00:51:26.630 --> 00:51:26.640 align:start position:0%
p.m the day prior just it's simply not
 
00:51:31.510 --> 00:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:35.390 --> 00:51:35.400 align:start position:0%
and we have some concerns too you know I
 
00:51:38.170 --> 00:51:38.180 align:start position:0%
start printing it as soon as I can
 
00:51:40.730 --> 00:51:40.740 align:start position:0%
because what if the printer breaks or
 
00:51:42.290 --> 00:51:42.300 align:start position:0%
what if there's other issues you're not
 
00:51:43.730 --> 00:51:43.740 align:start position:0%
going to have a checklist available for
 
00:51:45.650 --> 00:51:45.660 align:start position:0%
the election I don't think it's a good
 
00:51:49.309 --> 00:51:49.319 align:start position:0%
idea to start printing at 12 pm the day
 
00:51:49.319 --> 00:51:50.329 align:start position:0%
idea to start printing at 12 pm the day
prior

00:51:50.329 --> 00:51:50.339 align:start position:0%
prior
 
00:51:54.109 --> 00:51:54.119 align:start position:0%
so we are okay with the absentee cut off
 
00:51:56.990 --> 00:51:57.000 align:start position:0%
of 12. we didn't have any issues with
 
00:51:59.270 --> 00:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
that but we are against this bill
 
00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:01.849 align:start position:0%
that but we are against this bill
because

00:52:01.849 --> 00:52:01.859 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:52:03.470 --> 00:52:03.480 align:start position:0%
um it's just it's simply not enough time
 
00:52:07.130 --> 00:52:07.140 align:start position:0%
to get that checklist printed and as
 
00:52:09.530 --> 00:52:09.540 align:start position:0%
voters come in and request absentee
 
00:52:12.109 --> 00:52:12.119 align:start position:0%
ballots their name gets bolded so say
 
00:52:14.030 --> 00:52:14.040 align:start position:0%
you had the cutoff time on Friday you're
 
00:52:15.349 --> 00:52:15.359 align:start position:0%
going to have the majority of the
 
00:52:15.359 --> 00:52:16.750 align:start position:0%
going to have the majority of the
absentee

00:52:16.750 --> 00:52:16.760 align:start position:0%
absentee
 
00:52:20.329 --> 00:52:20.339 align:start position:0%
requests in bold already
 
00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:24.240 align:start position:0%
on Election Day when we start processing
 
00:52:25.970 --> 00:52:25.980 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots
 
00:52:28.309 --> 00:52:28.319 align:start position:0%
we then go over to the checklist and
 
00:52:29.990 --> 00:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
make sure that the name's not crossed
 
00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:30.670 align:start position:0%
make sure that the name's not crossed
out

00:52:30.670 --> 00:52:30.680 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:52:32.990 --> 00:52:33.000 align:start position:0%
they didn't come in in the morning and
 
00:52:34.490 --> 00:52:34.500 align:start position:0%
vote before
 
00:52:37.609 --> 00:52:37.619 align:start position:0%
so we we process the absentee we get it
 
00:52:39.829 --> 00:52:39.839 align:start position:0%
ready and then before it goes any
 
00:52:42.109 --> 00:52:42.119 align:start position:0%
further before it goes into the machine
 
00:52:44.750 --> 00:52:44.760 align:start position:0%
before it's counted they bring the list
 
00:52:47.150 --> 00:52:47.160 align:start position:0%
over to the ballot clerk that verifies
 
00:52:49.490 --> 00:52:49.500 align:start position:0%
the name's not crossed off then it's
 
00:52:52.190 --> 00:52:52.200 align:start position:0%
crossed off in red marked as an absentee
 
00:52:54.890 --> 00:52:54.900 align:start position:0%
voter and then the ballots processed so
 
00:52:57.430 --> 00:52:57.440 align:start position:0%
I think it would be very difficult to
 
00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:00.720 align:start position:0%
vote absentee and then come in and vote
 
00:53:02.650 --> 00:53:02.660 align:start position:0%
in person
 
00:53:05.450 --> 00:53:05.460 align:start position:0%
referencing putting two ballots in the
 
00:53:05.460 --> 00:53:06.490 align:start position:0%
referencing putting two ballots in the
machine

00:53:06.490 --> 00:53:06.500 align:start position:0%
machine
 
00:53:10.849 --> 00:53:10.859 align:start position:0%
most polling locations have someone at
 
00:53:13.849 --> 00:53:13.859 align:start position:0%
the machine at The Ballot Box or someone
 
00:53:15.710 --> 00:53:15.720 align:start position:0%
that's in the area whether it's the
 
00:53:18.170 --> 00:53:18.180 align:start position:0%
clerk the moderator an inspector of
 
00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:20.640 align:start position:0%
election there's people watching I I
 
00:53:23.510 --> 00:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
would find it very very difficult to put
 
00:53:25.849 --> 00:53:25.859 align:start position:0%
in your absentee ballot in the machine
 
00:53:28.370 --> 00:53:28.380 align:start position:0%
and also the ballot that you received
 
00:53:30.710 --> 00:53:30.720 align:start position:0%
that day
 
00:53:32.690 --> 00:53:32.700 align:start position:0%
um so with that I'd be open to any
 
00:53:32.700 --> 00:53:35.569 align:start position:0%
um so with that I'd be open to any
questions

00:53:35.569 --> 00:53:35.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:37.190 --> 00:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
we'll start from the left and work our
 
00:53:38.809 --> 00:53:38.819 align:start position:0%
way over representative weary
 
00:53:40.670 --> 00:53:40.680 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair and thank you Mr
 
00:53:42.470 --> 00:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
Healy for your testimony
 
00:53:44.589 --> 00:53:44.599 align:start position:0%
um just uh so I could be clear about
 
00:53:46.849 --> 00:53:46.859 align:start position:0%
what what you're objecting to and what
 
00:53:49.549 --> 00:53:49.559 align:start position:0%
you're not objecting to just so you're
 
00:53:52.250 --> 00:53:52.260 align:start position:0%
not objecting to placing the red ink AV
 
00:53:55.069 --> 00:53:55.079 align:start position:0%
or any of that or making the names of
 
00:53:58.010 --> 00:53:58.020 align:start position:0%
absentee voters distinguishable from
 
00:54:01.010 --> 00:54:01.020 align:start position:0%
other voters on that list
 
00:54:03.349 --> 00:54:03.359 align:start position:0%
it's it's really the timing of the
 
00:54:05.809 --> 00:54:05.819 align:start position:0%
printing of the checklist or the list is
 
00:54:08.270 --> 00:54:08.280 align:start position:0%
that correct yes that's correct
 
00:54:10.370 --> 00:54:10.380 align:start position:0%
um the day prior to the election there's
 
00:54:12.290 --> 00:54:12.300 align:start position:0%
so many things that clerks have to do
 
00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
some clerks are responsible for setting
 
00:54:16.010 --> 00:54:16.020 align:start position:0%
up their polling place we have to verify
 
00:54:19.309 --> 00:54:19.319 align:start position:0%
all the absentees that came in Prior it
 
00:54:22.069 --> 00:54:22.079 align:start position:0%
just it's not enough time to then print
 
00:54:24.290 --> 00:54:24.300 align:start position:0%
thousands of pages of the checklist and
 
00:54:28.450 --> 00:54:28.460 align:start position:0%
separate it out and currently
 
00:54:31.730 --> 00:54:31.740 align:start position:0%
voters that request an absentee ballot
 
00:54:34.370 --> 00:54:34.380 align:start position:0%
their names are already in bold on the
 
00:54:37.069 --> 00:54:37.079 align:start position:0%
checklist that I believe took effect a
 
00:54:38.750 --> 00:54:38.760 align:start position:0%
year or two ago so when the checklist
 
00:54:41.569 --> 00:54:41.579 align:start position:0%
prints if someone requests an absentee
 
00:54:43.549 --> 00:54:43.559 align:start position:0%
ballot up until the time the checklist
 
00:54:46.609 --> 00:54:46.619 align:start position:0%
is printed they would be in bold so
 
00:54:48.829 --> 00:54:48.839 align:start position:0%
you're really if if it was moved say to
 
00:54:50.690 --> 00:54:50.700 align:start position:0%
Friday you're really only talking the
 
00:54:52.970 --> 00:54:52.980 align:start position:0%
ballots that would come in on Monday
 
00:54:55.430 --> 00:54:55.440 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't be in bold
 
00:54:55.440 --> 00:54:57.970 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't be in bold
foreign

00:54:57.970 --> 00:54:57.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:02.809 --> 00:55:02.819 align:start position:0%
so would you be amenable to having the
 
00:55:05.150 --> 00:55:05.160 align:start position:0%
additional names from or from the
 
00:55:06.829 --> 00:55:06.839 align:start position:0%
additional requests highlighted or
 
00:55:09.950 --> 00:55:09.960 align:start position:0%
distinguished in some way
 
00:55:11.510 --> 00:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
um in addition to the ones that are
 
00:55:16.069 --> 00:55:16.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:18.290 --> 00:55:18.300 align:start position:0%
I would be open to what I I would find
 
00:55:21.349 --> 00:55:21.359 align:start position:0%
it still to be difficult a day prior but
 
00:55:23.329 --> 00:55:23.339 align:start position:0%
if if that's what the committee decides
 
00:55:24.530 --> 00:55:24.540 align:start position:0%
I mean
 
00:55:27.710 --> 00:55:27.720 align:start position:0%
um it's it's better than having to print
 
00:55:30.410 --> 00:55:30.420 align:start position:0%
the whole checklist a day prior but it's
 
00:55:32.210 --> 00:55:32.220 align:start position:0%
still I think it would be a tough task
 
00:55:34.490 --> 00:55:34.500 align:start position:0%
for larger communities the day prior
 
00:55:36.950 --> 00:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
some smaller communities you know if you
 
00:55:38.870 --> 00:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
have 10 people come in it wouldn't be
 
00:55:40.849 --> 00:55:40.859 align:start position:0%
that challenging but if you have a few
 
00:55:43.190 --> 00:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
hundred that are requesting it could be
 
00:55:45.829 --> 00:55:45.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:47.510 --> 00:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
representative Bay
 
00:55:49.490 --> 00:55:49.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Vice chair thank you for
 
00:55:50.930 --> 00:55:50.940 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:55:55.370 --> 00:55:55.380 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you say that if you uh or
 
00:55:58.790 --> 00:55:58.800 align:start position:0%
tasked with uh watching the ballots as
 
00:56:00.530 --> 00:56:00.540 align:start position:0%
they go in the machine
 
00:56:05.329 --> 00:56:05.339 align:start position:0%
that it would be easy to tell that the
 
00:56:07.430 --> 00:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
ballot was from an absentee ballot
 
00:56:09.829 --> 00:56:09.839 align:start position:0%
because they would have been folded
 
00:56:12.950 --> 00:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
yes I I believe it would be rather easy
 
00:56:14.210 --> 00:56:14.220 align:start position:0%
to see
 
00:56:16.730 --> 00:56:16.740 align:start position:0%
um an absentee ballot going into the
 
00:56:19.730 --> 00:56:19.740 align:start position:0%
machine over uh an election day ballot
 
00:56:22.430 --> 00:56:22.440 align:start position:0%
that was received from the ballot clerks
 
00:56:25.250 --> 00:56:25.260 align:start position:0%
that day thank you
 
00:56:26.690 --> 00:56:26.700 align:start position:0%
we're coming back we're swinging back
 
00:56:28.670 --> 00:56:28.680 align:start position:0%
around uh representative Hamlet
 
00:56:30.470 --> 00:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:56:32.450 --> 00:56:32.460 align:start position:0%
my question
 
00:56:34.790 --> 00:56:34.800 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:56:38.569 --> 00:56:38.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:38.579 --> 00:56:41.089 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:56:41.089 --> 00:56:41.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:44.450 --> 00:56:44.460 align:start position:0%
it's it's either a law or a rule it's in
 
00:56:46.370 --> 00:56:46.380 align:start position:0%
the procedure manual that somebody has
 
00:56:49.490 --> 00:56:49.500 align:start position:0%
to be standing at the voting machine
 
00:56:52.309 --> 00:56:52.319 align:start position:0%
is it possible that
 
00:56:54.470 --> 00:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
in Windham or in sometimes there is not
 
00:56:56.109 --> 00:56:56.119 align:start position:0%
somebody standing at the voting machine
 
00:56:58.430 --> 00:56:58.440 align:start position:0%
watching carefully
 
00:57:00.710 --> 00:57:00.720 align:start position:0%
I mean I would say it's possible but
 
00:57:05.750 --> 00:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
it's probably not likely there's usually
 
00:57:08.809 --> 00:57:08.819 align:start position:0%
um yeah that someone is assigned to to
 
00:57:11.390 --> 00:57:11.400 align:start position:0%
be there to watch it and if they need a
 
00:57:14.630 --> 00:57:14.640 align:start position:0%
break or something say someone has a say
 
00:57:16.069 --> 00:57:16.079 align:start position:0%
it's the moderator and a voter has a
 
00:57:17.809 --> 00:57:17.819 align:start position:0%
question for the moderator they would
 
00:57:19.730 --> 00:57:19.740 align:start position:0%
make sure that someone else is watching
 
00:57:23.990 --> 00:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:25.910 --> 00:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
all right moving down from the left all
 
00:57:26.930 --> 00:57:26.940 align:start position:0%
right now we'll swing back to you
 
00:57:29.870 --> 00:57:29.880 align:start position:0%
representative Brennan thank you am I
 
00:57:31.430 --> 00:57:31.440 align:start position:0%
understanding your testimony correctly
 
00:57:33.650 --> 00:57:33.660 align:start position:0%
that when
 
00:57:36.589 --> 00:57:36.599 align:start position:0%
a voter requests an absentee ballot
 
00:57:39.770 --> 00:57:39.780 align:start position:0%
their name is bolded on
 
00:57:41.270 --> 00:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
the checklist
 
00:57:44.690 --> 00:57:44.700 align:start position:0%
yes so it's it's relatively new
 
00:57:47.630 --> 00:57:47.640 align:start position:0%
um electionnet which we enter absentee
 
00:57:49.910 --> 00:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
ballots into when the checklist is
 
00:57:51.950 --> 00:57:51.960 align:start position:0%
printed as long as they had requested an
 
00:57:54.370 --> 00:57:54.380 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot prior to us
 
00:58:00.589 --> 00:58:00.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:02.510 --> 00:58:02.520 align:start position:0%
it seemed like there was a little bit of
 
00:58:05.270 --> 00:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
confusion but that is already happening
 
00:58:08.630 --> 00:58:08.640 align:start position:0%
that absentee voters are marked in bold
 
00:58:10.490 --> 00:58:10.500 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:58:13.730 --> 00:58:13.740 align:start position:0%
sorry let me just follow up please it
 
00:58:15.349 --> 00:58:15.359 align:start position:0%
has to be not to be a sticker but it has
 
00:58:19.490 --> 00:58:19.500 align:start position:0%
to be a question yes if I believe that
 
00:58:19.500 --> 00:58:20.150 align:start position:0%
to be a question yes if I believe that
um

00:58:20.150 --> 00:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:22.790 --> 00:58:22.800 align:start position:0%
and when that apps CNT voter turns in
 
00:58:25.010 --> 00:58:25.020 align:start position:0%
their ballot am I understanding
 
00:58:26.990 --> 00:58:27.000 align:start position:0%
correctly that the checklist is then
 
00:58:30.829 --> 00:58:30.839 align:start position:0%
marked with a red ink AV to declare that
 
00:58:33.650 --> 00:58:33.660 align:start position:0%
that vote has been cast yes on Election
 
00:58:35.210 --> 00:58:35.220 align:start position:0%
Day so
 
00:58:38.750 --> 00:58:38.760 align:start position:0%
uh two hours after the polls open with
 
00:58:42.230 --> 00:58:42.240 align:start position:0%
notice the clerk and moderator can start
 
00:58:44.450 --> 00:58:44.460 align:start position:0%
processing apps and T ballots and at
 
00:58:47.150 --> 00:58:47.160 align:start position:0%
that time during their processing when
 
00:58:49.190 --> 00:58:49.200 align:start position:0%
they get to that point they go bring the
 
00:58:52.190 --> 00:58:52.200 align:start position:0%
list over to the ballot Clerk and they
 
00:58:54.710 --> 00:58:54.720 align:start position:0%
can cross the name off in red and right
 
00:58:58.670 --> 00:58:58.680 align:start position:0%
mark them as an AV absentee voter and at
 
00:59:02.270 --> 00:59:02.280 align:start position:0%
that point in current law a resident
 
00:59:04.130 --> 00:59:04.140 align:start position:0%
couldn't come in and vote in person
 
00:59:08.450 --> 00:59:08.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:10.609 --> 00:59:10.619 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
00:59:12.349 --> 00:59:12.359 align:start position:0%
okay seeing none thank you Mr Healy
 
00:59:14.450 --> 00:59:14.460 align:start position:0%
thank you all right
 
00:59:14.460 --> 00:59:15.430 align:start position:0%
thank you all right
um

00:59:15.430 --> 00:59:15.440 align:start position:0%

00:59:21.720 --> 00:59:23.210 align:start position:0%
um deputy secretary of state Aaron
Hennessey

00:59:23.210 --> 00:59:23.220 align:start position:0%
Hennessey
 
00:59:24.789 --> 00:59:24.799 align:start position:0%
oh I apologize
 
00:59:26.450 --> 00:59:26.460 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna
 
00:59:28.190 --> 00:59:28.200 align:start position:0%
uh it came around the wrong direction I
 
00:59:33.650 --> 00:59:33.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:39.430 --> 00:59:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:42.289 --> 00:59:42.299 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair my name is Liz
 
00:59:46.370 --> 00:59:46.380 align:start position:0%
tantarelli I'm testifying today as an
 
00:59:48.230 --> 00:59:48.240 align:start position:0%
individual not for my League of Women
 
00:59:50.089 --> 00:59:50.099 align:start position:0%
Voters position
 
00:59:53.030 --> 00:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
and uh in all honesty I already signed
 
00:59:57.049 --> 00:59:57.059 align:start position:0%
in opposed I wasn't planning to speak so
 
00:59:59.630 --> 00:59:59.640 align:start position:0%
I'm not trying to vote twice but
 
00:59:59.640 --> 01:00:01.549 align:start position:0%
I'm not trying to vote twice but
whatever

01:00:01.549 --> 01:00:01.559 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
01:00:03.950 --> 01:00:03.960 align:start position:0%
um I I was surprised at the testimony
 
01:00:07.190 --> 01:00:07.200 align:start position:0%
this bill has taken because it's not
 
01:00:11.089 --> 01:00:11.099 align:start position:0%
what I saw as the issue my issue is the
 
01:00:14.870 --> 01:00:14.880 align:start position:0%
changing of the time from 5 PM to noon
 
01:00:18.230 --> 01:00:18.240 align:start position:0%
on the day before election day because
 
01:00:21.230 --> 01:00:21.240 align:start position:0%
the legislature and its wisdom
 
01:00:24.109 --> 01:00:24.119 align:start position:0%
several years ago realized that there
 
01:00:27.950 --> 01:00:27.960 align:start position:0%
may be occasions such as blizzards on
 
01:00:30.650 --> 01:00:30.660 align:start position:0%
Election Day in town meeting remember we
 
01:00:33.650 --> 01:00:33.660 align:start position:0%
had that twice in a row two years in a
 
01:00:36.710 --> 01:00:36.720 align:start position:0%
row when people will decide the day
 
01:00:40.430 --> 01:00:40.440 align:start position:0%
before as I did that my little car isn't
 
01:00:43.030 --> 01:00:43.040 align:start position:0%
going to make that hill on Election Day
 
01:00:47.030 --> 01:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
not safely anyway and so I went in and
 
01:00:50.450 --> 01:00:50.460 align:start position:0%
voted absentee at about 4 30 in the
 
01:00:53.990 --> 01:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
afternoon on the day before election day
 
01:00:57.829 --> 01:00:57.839 align:start position:0%
so I was reading this bill and objecting
 
01:01:01.849 --> 01:01:01.859 align:start position:0%
to it in that an absentee ballot would
 
01:01:05.270 --> 01:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
not be able to be handed to me
 
01:01:08.390 --> 01:01:08.400 align:start position:0%
at 4 30 in the afternoon on the day
 
01:01:11.030 --> 01:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
before the blizzard when I realized I'm
 
01:01:13.370 --> 01:01:13.380 align:start position:0%
not going to get here tomorrow
 
01:01:17.150 --> 01:01:17.160 align:start position:0%
so that's just that line seven changing
 
01:01:20.750 --> 01:01:20.760 align:start position:0%
it from 5 PM to noon and if I'm
 
01:01:22.849 --> 01:01:22.859 align:start position:0%
misreading that and it doesn't change
 
01:01:25.750 --> 01:01:25.760 align:start position:0%
that then I apologize for my
 
01:01:29.030 --> 01:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding but it seems to say the
 
01:01:32.569 --> 01:01:32.579 align:start position:0%
clerk shall send absentee ballots and
 
01:01:34.730 --> 01:01:34.740 align:start position:0%
send I'm taking in the broadest sense
 
01:01:37.250 --> 01:01:37.260 align:start position:0%
not bringing to them not bringing to the
 
01:01:40.250 --> 01:01:40.260 align:start position:0%
post office but delivering to the voter
 
01:01:43.250 --> 01:01:43.260 align:start position:0%
the clerk shall send absentee ballots in
 
01:01:45.589 --> 01:01:45.599 align:start position:0%
response to verified absentee ballot
 
01:01:48.410 --> 01:01:48.420 align:start position:0%
requests until noon on the day before
 
01:01:51.470 --> 01:01:51.480 align:start position:0%
the election day and that was not the
 
01:01:53.089 --> 01:01:53.099 align:start position:0%
intent of that bill that this
 
01:01:55.730 --> 01:01:55.740 align:start position:0%
legislature so wisely passed several
 
01:01:57.109 --> 01:01:57.119 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
01:01:59.329 --> 01:01:59.339 align:start position:0%
so I'll leave the rest of the argument
 
01:02:01.010 --> 01:02:01.020 align:start position:0%
to the other people who have testified
 
01:02:02.990 --> 01:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
but I would like to see that time
 
01:02:06.049 --> 01:02:06.059 align:start position:0%
changed back to the 5 PM that was in
 
01:02:08.569 --> 01:02:08.579 align:start position:0%
that bill if there are questions about
 
01:02:11.690 --> 01:02:11.700 align:start position:0%
that I'd happily answer them
 
01:02:14.030 --> 01:02:14.040 align:start position:0%
represent Flame
 
01:02:18.470 --> 01:02:18.480 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chair and Ms tantarelli
 
01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:19.010 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chair and Ms tantarelli
um

01:02:19.010 --> 01:02:19.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:21.470 --> 01:02:21.480 align:start position:0%
would you be comfortable if we made it
 
01:02:24.170 --> 01:02:24.180 align:start position:0%
that they would send it by mail by noon
 
01:02:28.490 --> 01:02:28.500 align:start position:0%
because or and then by hand by 5 PM or
 
01:02:31.250 --> 01:02:31.260 align:start position:0%
by whenever they close I I suppose I'd
 
01:02:33.349 --> 01:02:33.359 align:start position:0%
be comfortable if you change the word
 
01:02:35.150 --> 01:02:35.160 align:start position:0%
sin to deliver
 
01:02:38.510 --> 01:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
because deliver could be by hand at the
 
01:02:41.210 --> 01:02:41.220 align:start position:0%
at the clerk's office which is what I
 
01:02:43.849 --> 01:02:43.859 align:start position:0%
did draw that one year
 
01:02:43.859 --> 01:02:44.890 align:start position:0%
did draw that one year
um

01:02:44.890 --> 01:02:44.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:47.510 --> 01:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
the post office is an issue you know
 
01:02:50.569 --> 01:02:50.579 align:start position:0%
trying to to mail something at 5 PM but
 
01:02:53.630 --> 01:02:53.640 align:start position:0%
deliver allows for the uh the
 
01:02:55.609 --> 01:02:55.619 align:start position:0%
recognition in the first several lines
 
01:02:58.250 --> 01:02:58.260 align:start position:0%
of this bill which I believe is not a
 
01:03:01.910 --> 01:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
change of text that delivery can be done
 
01:03:04.069 --> 01:03:04.079 align:start position:0%
in a number of ways by a number of
 
01:03:06.950 --> 01:03:06.960 align:start position:0%
elected officials
 
01:03:08.210 --> 01:03:08.220 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
01:03:11.270 --> 01:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
representative Weir so I I think the
 
01:03:13.730 --> 01:03:13.740 align:start position:0%
sponsor when talking about this portion
 
01:03:17.150 --> 01:03:17.160 align:start position:0%
was talking very specifically about
 
01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:18.890 align:start position:0%
was talking very specifically about
the

01:03:18.890 --> 01:03:18.900 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:03:18.900 --> 01:03:20.530 align:start position:0%
the
uh

01:03:20.530 --> 01:03:20.540 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:03:25.430 --> 01:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
sending by mail and so do you see any
 
01:03:29.210 --> 01:03:29.220 align:start position:0%
problems with the as representative Lane
 
01:03:31.730 --> 01:03:31.740 align:start position:0%
mentioned sending by mail and or
 
01:03:34.190 --> 01:03:34.200 align:start position:0%
delivering by hand you know and having
 
01:03:37.430 --> 01:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
distinct times for the two to
 
01:03:39.950 --> 01:03:39.960 align:start position:0%
you accommodate the closure of post
 
01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:41.089 align:start position:0%
you accommodate the closure of post
offices

01:03:41.089 --> 01:03:41.099 align:start position:0%
offices
 
01:03:44.750 --> 01:03:44.760 align:start position:0%
as well as you know
 
01:03:46.789 --> 01:03:46.799 align:start position:0%
Town Halls that might be open for an
 
01:03:48.530 --> 01:03:48.540 align:start position:0%
extended period of time to accommodate
 
01:03:50.930 --> 01:03:50.940 align:start position:0%
walk-ins who are requesting absentee
 
01:03:53.109 --> 01:03:53.119 align:start position:0%
ballots such as you Illustrated yourself
 
01:03:55.789 --> 01:03:55.799 align:start position:0%
well I I think something has to be
 
01:03:58.549 --> 01:03:58.559 align:start position:0%
clarified here frankly anybody who
 
01:04:01.609 --> 01:04:01.619 align:start position:0%
trusts my mail but my post office to
 
01:04:04.010 --> 01:04:04.020 align:start position:0%
deliver something that's dropped off at
 
01:04:07.630 --> 01:04:07.640 align:start position:0%
noon by the next day is naive
 
01:04:10.730 --> 01:04:10.740 align:start position:0%
this is not going to happen so that's
 
01:04:13.630 --> 01:04:13.640 align:start position:0%
why I think the notion of deliver
 
01:04:17.329 --> 01:04:17.339 align:start position:0%
allows for the town clerk to say the
 
01:04:20.210 --> 01:04:20.220 align:start position:0%
only way this person who suddenly landed
 
01:04:23.030 --> 01:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
in a hospital can possibly get this
 
01:04:26.210 --> 01:04:26.220 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot as if I get the select
 
01:04:28.490 --> 01:04:28.500 align:start position:0%
board member who's willing to do this to
 
01:04:29.990 --> 01:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
hand deliver it
 
01:04:33.410 --> 01:04:33.420 align:start position:0%
so I I don't
 
01:04:35.990 --> 01:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
that's why I would just say exchange sin
 
01:04:39.250 --> 01:04:39.260 align:start position:0%
to deliver and and leave it up to the
 
01:04:41.690 --> 01:04:41.700 align:start position:0%
officials to figure out the way that
 
01:04:45.230 --> 01:04:45.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:47.569 --> 01:04:47.579 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
01:04:49.970 --> 01:04:49.980 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you thank you
 
01:04:49.980 --> 01:04:50.870 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you thank you
um

01:04:50.870 --> 01:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:53.450 --> 01:04:53.460 align:start position:0%
we'll do um
 
01:05:02.210 --> 01:05:02.220 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:05.930 --> 01:05:05.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:07.730 --> 01:05:07.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and I really
 
01:05:10.490 --> 01:05:10.500 align:start position:0%
appreciate the flexibility as the sole
 
01:05:12.170 --> 01:05:12.180 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of the bill in the room I
 
01:05:14.690 --> 01:05:14.700 align:start position:0%
just wanted to talk to the very valid
 
01:05:16.789 --> 01:05:16.799 align:start position:0%
concerns raised and to make it clear
 
01:05:19.549 --> 01:05:19.559 align:start position:0%
that it is absolutely not the intent of
 
01:05:22.849 --> 01:05:22.859 align:start position:0%
this bill to prevent a you know town
 
01:05:25.490 --> 01:05:25.500 align:start position:0%
clerk from delivering ballots to
 
01:05:27.589 --> 01:05:27.599 align:start position:0%
somebody who walks in this is strictly
 
01:05:29.930 --> 01:05:29.940 align:start position:0%
about the concern that if you try to
 
01:05:32.150 --> 01:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
mail something at 5 PM through the U.S
 
01:05:34.910 --> 01:05:34.920 align:start position:0%
Postal Service it won't make it I
 
01:05:37.010 --> 01:05:37.020 align:start position:0%
actually asked the primary sponsor why
 
01:05:39.410 --> 01:05:39.420 align:start position:0%
is she comfortable with even 12 because
 
01:05:42.049 --> 01:05:42.059 align:start position:0%
Gardner is delivering mail you know one
 
01:05:43.970 --> 01:05:43.980 align:start position:0%
day after the other is kind of difficult
 
01:05:46.190 --> 01:05:46.200 align:start position:0%
and by the way if you are at home to
 
01:05:48.049 --> 01:05:48.059 align:start position:0%
receive the mail how you are you gonna
 
01:05:51.710 --> 01:05:51.720 align:start position:0%
not be there to be able to vote so you
 
01:05:54.950 --> 01:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
know this is absolutely and I was told
 
01:05:58.609 --> 01:05:58.619 align:start position:0%
specifically that this language just
 
01:06:00.829 --> 01:06:00.839 align:start position:0%
makes it clear that your obligation to
 
01:06:03.589 --> 01:06:03.599 align:start position:0%
mail the ballots ends at 12s you can
 
01:06:05.870 --> 01:06:05.880 align:start position:0%
still mail the ballots after 12 if you
 
01:06:08.329 --> 01:06:08.339 align:start position:0%
feel that you know the Postal Service
 
01:06:11.450 --> 01:06:11.460 align:start position:0%
you know will get it done and there is
 
01:06:13.609 --> 01:06:13.619 align:start position:0%
absolutely zero intent to remove the
 
01:06:15.470 --> 01:06:15.480 align:start position:0%
ability of anybody to walk in for as
 
01:06:17.270 --> 01:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
long as the town clerk is open and vote
 
01:06:18.230 --> 01:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
in person
 
01:06:20.809 --> 01:06:20.819 align:start position:0%
that you know if clarifying language is
 
01:06:23.990 --> 01:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
needed I'll be happy to you know
 
01:06:26.150 --> 01:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
try to work with the OLS or leave it to
 
01:06:28.130 --> 01:06:28.140 align:start position:0%
the committee to provide the clarifying
 
01:06:30.710 --> 01:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
language but there is zero intent you
 
01:06:32.809 --> 01:06:32.819 align:start position:0%
know to create that type of situation
 
01:06:35.210 --> 01:06:35.220 align:start position:0%
and I would oppose those types of laws
 
01:06:38.750 --> 01:06:38.760 align:start position:0%
as fiercely as I can I mean seriously
 
01:06:40.549 --> 01:06:40.559 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:06:40.559 --> 01:06:41.690 align:start position:0%
thank you
okay

01:06:41.690 --> 01:06:41.700 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:06:44.630 --> 01:06:44.640 align:start position:0%
next up uh deputy secretary Aaron
 
01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:53.750 align:start position:0%
next up uh deputy secretary Aaron
Hennessey

01:06:53.750 --> 01:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:55.309 --> 01:06:55.319 align:start position:0%
good morning everyone nice to see you
 
01:06:56.990 --> 01:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
all again Aaron Hennessey deputy
 
01:06:59.690 --> 01:06:59.700 align:start position:0%
secretary of state I just wanted to
 
01:07:02.510 --> 01:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
give some clarification on some of the
 
01:07:04.370 --> 01:07:04.380 align:start position:0%
points that were raised also probably
 
01:07:06.170 --> 01:07:06.180 align:start position:0%
just repeat a lot of things that
 
01:07:06.180 --> 01:07:07.370 align:start position:0%
just repeat a lot of things that
unfortunately

01:07:07.370 --> 01:07:07.380 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
01:07:09.170 --> 01:07:09.180 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately repeat but some of the
 
01:07:11.569 --> 01:07:11.579 align:start position:0%
things that other people have said
 
01:07:14.770 --> 01:07:14.780 align:start position:0%
um the first section the 12 pm change
 
01:07:17.210 --> 01:07:17.220 align:start position:0%
there would need to be a clarification
 
01:07:19.670 --> 01:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
made an amendment made to this because
 
01:07:21.890 --> 01:07:21.900 align:start position:0%
the way it is written it would be all
 
01:07:25.970 --> 01:07:25.980 align:start position:0%
delivery of balance and our office is
 
01:07:29.029 --> 01:07:29.039 align:start position:0%
okay with the time of the mailing of 12
 
01:07:31.730 --> 01:07:31.740 align:start position:0%
pm being changed but we would oppose any
 
01:07:33.650 --> 01:07:33.660 align:start position:0%
legislation that restricts somebody from
 
01:07:36.650 --> 01:07:36.660 align:start position:0%
coming in until 5 PM to get a absentee
 
01:07:36.660 --> 01:07:38.630 align:start position:0%
coming in until 5 PM to get a absentee
ballot

01:07:38.630 --> 01:07:38.640 align:start position:0%
ballot
 
01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:39.549 align:start position:0%
ballot
um

01:07:39.549 --> 01:07:39.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:42.710 --> 01:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
the and again that that would need to be
 
01:07:44.510 --> 01:07:44.520 align:start position:0%
clarified via an amendment
 
01:07:46.250 --> 01:07:46.260 align:start position:0%
um the intent is not clear and it would
 
01:07:48.829 --> 01:07:48.839 align:start position:0%
change change the 5 PM to 12 p.m
 
01:07:48.839 --> 01:07:50.450 align:start position:0%
change change the 5 PM to 12 p.m
currently

01:07:50.450 --> 01:07:50.460 align:start position:0%
currently
 
01:07:50.460 --> 01:07:52.490 align:start position:0%
currently
um

01:07:52.490 --> 01:07:52.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:55.910 --> 01:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
the the checklist if you if you look on
 
01:07:59.029 --> 01:07:59.039 align:start position:0%
lines 20 and 21 and the posting of the
 
01:08:01.789 --> 01:08:01.799 align:start position:0%
checklist by the supervisors
 
01:08:05.150 --> 01:08:05.160 align:start position:0%
um there's a few things with this on 21
 
01:08:09.710 --> 01:08:09.720 align:start position:0%
it says not sooner than 12 pm
 
01:08:11.930 --> 01:08:11.940 align:start position:0%
so if for those of you legislators that
 
01:08:13.849 --> 01:08:13.859 align:start position:0%
have been around for a while the devil's
 
01:08:15.589 --> 01:08:15.599 align:start position:0%
always in the details and how you write
 
01:08:17.870 --> 01:08:17.880 align:start position:0%
something in shall or may but not sooner
 
01:08:19.669 --> 01:08:19.679 align:start position:0%
than is much different than the current
 
01:08:22.010 --> 01:08:22.020 align:start position:0%
language if not later then and not
 
01:08:23.510 --> 01:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
sooner than means that somebody could
 
01:08:27.530 --> 01:08:27.540 align:start position:0%
post it possibly after the election
 
01:08:27.540 --> 01:08:28.870 align:start position:0%
post it possibly after the election
um

01:08:28.870 --> 01:08:28.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:31.189 --> 01:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
so that would mean to need to be
 
01:08:33.410 --> 01:08:33.420 align:start position:0%
clarified but we're also opposed to the
 
01:08:35.689 --> 01:08:35.699 align:start position:0%
the 12 p.m time and for for a few
 
01:08:37.130 --> 01:08:37.140 align:start position:0%
different reasons
 
01:08:37.140 --> 01:08:38.689 align:start position:0%
different reasons
um

01:08:38.689 --> 01:08:38.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:42.169 --> 01:08:42.179 align:start position:0%
um we're we are in favor of posting the
 
01:08:44.870 --> 01:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
checklist as soon it is corrected by the
 
01:08:47.570 --> 01:08:47.580 align:start position:0%
supervisors the checklist so there's
 
01:08:49.550 --> 01:08:49.560 align:start position:0%
um the current laws the fourth Tuesday
 
01:08:52.550 --> 01:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
or sorry I haven't had it memorized yet
 
01:08:54.530 --> 01:08:54.540 align:start position:0%
soon enough hopefully I'll be like Dave
 
01:08:56.150 --> 01:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
Scanlon and have all this information
 
01:08:58.910 --> 01:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
just flowing out of my head but
 
01:09:00.289 --> 01:09:00.299 align:start position:0%
um and then they have once it's
 
01:09:02.809 --> 01:09:02.819 align:start position:0%
corrected six to 13 days before the
 
01:09:06.169 --> 01:09:06.179 align:start position:0%
election it's it's reposted
 
01:09:09.050 --> 01:09:09.060 align:start position:0%
um the the form of the checklist that's
 
01:09:12.050 --> 01:09:12.060 align:start position:0%
posted is not does not have absentee
 
01:09:13.910 --> 01:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
voters bolded
 
01:09:15.709 --> 01:09:15.719 align:start position:0%
um one of the I think one of the
 
01:09:17.209 --> 01:09:17.219 align:start position:0%
committee members and somebody else who
 
01:09:19.669 --> 01:09:19.679 align:start position:0%
testified said that this would be an
 
01:09:21.709 --> 01:09:21.719 align:start position:0%
issue for privacy rights for for
 
01:09:21.719 --> 01:09:23.090 align:start position:0%
issue for privacy rights for for
individuals

01:09:23.090 --> 01:09:23.100 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
01:09:23.100 --> 01:09:23.870 align:start position:0%
individuals
um

01:09:23.870 --> 01:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:25.789 --> 01:09:25.799 align:start position:0%
I know when I go on vacation I never
 
01:09:28.070 --> 01:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
Post online that I'm on vacation it's
 
01:09:30.289 --> 01:09:30.299 align:start position:0%
for reasons why I don't want somebody to
 
01:09:32.150 --> 01:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
know that I'm not home so they can
 
01:09:34.370 --> 01:09:34.380 align:start position:0%
easily go and rob my house but that that
 
01:09:36.050 --> 01:09:36.060 align:start position:0%
would be the same concern for voters
 
01:09:38.090 --> 01:09:38.100 align:start position:0%
some of them who request an absentee
 
01:09:39.590 --> 01:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
ballot is because they're not going to
 
01:09:41.689 --> 01:09:41.699 align:start position:0%
be home at the time of the election and
 
01:09:43.430 --> 01:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
this would just notify the entire public
 
01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:44.689 align:start position:0%
this would just notify the entire public
that

01:09:44.689 --> 01:09:44.699 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:09:46.490 --> 01:09:46.500 align:start position:0%
um that they're not home so the current
 
01:09:50.090 --> 01:09:50.100 align:start position:0%
checklist that's um posted does not have
 
01:09:52.550 --> 01:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
absentee voters bolded and if you know
 
01:09:55.490 --> 01:09:55.500 align:start position:0%
if you've ever requested a a checklist
 
01:09:58.130 --> 01:09:58.140 align:start position:0%
from the supervisors uh sorry Secretary
 
01:10:00.770 --> 01:10:00.780 align:start position:0%
of State for absentee voters only
 
01:10:03.350 --> 01:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
candidates and parties and political
 
01:10:06.610 --> 01:10:06.620 align:start position:0%
committees can request an absentee voter
 
01:10:09.290 --> 01:10:09.300 align:start position:0%
some a list of absentee voters who've
 
01:10:11.930 --> 01:10:11.940 align:start position:0%
requested so that information before an
 
01:10:14.450 --> 01:10:14.460 align:start position:0%
election is not public information about
 
01:10:16.610 --> 01:10:16.620 align:start position:0%
absentee voters
 
01:10:19.250 --> 01:10:19.260 align:start position:0%
um so we would be opposed to the Bolding
 
01:10:21.590 --> 01:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
on the checklist prior to an election
 
01:10:24.709 --> 01:10:24.719 align:start position:0%
just for security information
 
01:10:24.719 --> 01:10:27.590 align:start position:0%
just for security information
um

01:10:27.590 --> 01:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:31.070 --> 01:10:31.080 align:start position:0%
the the next piece in section three
 
01:10:32.870 --> 01:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
um and I believe many people spoke to
 
01:10:35.270 --> 01:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
this was that someone may believe that
 
01:10:36.950 --> 01:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
they're going to be absent prior to the
 
01:10:38.689 --> 01:10:38.699 align:start position:0%
election but on the day of the election
 
01:10:40.669 --> 01:10:40.679 align:start position:0%
their work schedule changes or their
 
01:10:42.890 --> 01:10:42.900 align:start position:0%
vacation plans change and they want to
 
01:10:45.649 --> 01:10:45.659 align:start position:0%
follow the letter of the law and they
 
01:10:47.090 --> 01:10:47.100 align:start position:0%
um want to come in and vote in person
 
01:10:49.370 --> 01:10:49.380 align:start position:0%
before their absentee ballot is
 
01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
processed and the way the verbiage of is
 
01:10:54.530 --> 01:10:54.540 align:start position:0%
currently written this would not allow
 
01:10:56.810 --> 01:10:56.820 align:start position:0%
somebody to do that so they would kind
 
01:10:59.570 --> 01:10:59.580 align:start position:0%
of have to break current law and not
 
01:11:01.669 --> 01:11:01.679 align:start position:0%
vote in person even though they're not
 
01:11:04.010 --> 01:11:04.020 align:start position:0%
going to be absent and just the Optics
 
01:11:06.290 --> 01:11:06.300 align:start position:0%
of that is not great when you realize
 
01:11:08.930 --> 01:11:08.940 align:start position:0%
your neighbor voted via absentee ballot
 
01:11:10.669 --> 01:11:10.679 align:start position:0%
and you saw them in Shaw's that's not
 
01:11:12.530 --> 01:11:12.540 align:start position:0%
it's not a great look for somebody so
 
01:11:14.930 --> 01:11:14.940 align:start position:0%
some people when their chip plans change
 
01:11:16.850 --> 01:11:16.860 align:start position:0%
do want to vote in person in the way
 
01:11:18.410 --> 01:11:18.420 align:start position:0%
this is written currently wouldn't allow
 
01:11:18.420 --> 01:11:20.149 align:start position:0%
this is written currently wouldn't allow
that

01:11:20.149 --> 01:11:20.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:11:20.159 --> 01:11:25.729 align:start position:0%
that
um

01:11:25.729 --> 01:11:25.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:27.709 --> 01:11:27.719 align:start position:0%
I think that's all I have fair enough
 
01:11:30.830 --> 01:11:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:32.990 --> 01:11:33.000 align:start position:0%
wow okay thanks you
 
01:11:34.490 --> 01:11:34.500 align:start position:0%
um not surprising are there anyone else
 
01:11:38.990 --> 01:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
who wishes to speak on House Bill 244 I
 
01:11:39.950 --> 01:11:39.960 align:start position:0%
don't know why I'm gonna do that I'm
 
01:11:41.630 --> 01:11:41.640 align:start position:0%
sorry sorry
 
01:11:44.390 --> 01:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
all right uh can you grab the blue sheet
 
01:11:46.310 --> 01:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
for me I'm gonna close I actually need
 
01:11:47.330 --> 01:11:47.340 align:start position:0%
to read the blue sheet first before I
 
01:11:58.430 --> 01:11:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:01.130 --> 01:12:01.140 align:start position:0%
all right okay
 
01:12:02.689 --> 01:12:02.699 align:start position:0%
um well we gotta take off that one gotta
 
01:12:03.830 --> 01:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
take off that one
 
01:12:06.530 --> 01:12:06.540 align:start position:0%
okay so there were
 
01:12:08.090 --> 01:12:08.100 align:start position:0%
two people signed in that didn't speak
 
01:12:10.550 --> 01:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
they were both signed in against it with
 
01:12:12.470 --> 01:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
that I will close the public hearing on
 
01:12:15.050 --> 01:12:15.060 align:start position:0%
HB 244 and I will immediately open the
 
01:12:18.709 --> 01:12:18.719 align:start position:0%
uh here uh the hearing on House Bill 316
 
01:12:21.110 --> 01:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
relative to meetings of the supervisor
 
01:12:23.390 --> 01:12:23.400 align:start position:0%
the checklist representative Leon you're
 
01:12:24.709 --> 01:12:24.719 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor of the Bill thank you
 
01:12:26.689 --> 01:12:26.699 align:start position:0%
welcome to election law um thank you Mr
 
01:12:28.189 --> 01:12:28.199 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you members of the
 
01:12:32.390 --> 01:12:32.400 align:start position:0%
committee House Bill 316 is probably the
 
01:12:34.850 --> 01:12:34.860 align:start position:0%
most extreme solution to a problem that
 
01:12:37.610 --> 01:12:37.620 align:start position:0%
I've identified two years ago we passed
 
01:12:39.890 --> 01:12:39.900 align:start position:0%
a bill that creates more categories of
 
01:12:41.870 --> 01:12:41.880 align:start position:0%
reasons and ways to notify the
 
01:12:44.090 --> 01:12:44.100 align:start position:0%
supervisors of the checklist of people
 
01:12:45.950 --> 01:12:45.960 align:start position:0%
who may have moved from town and
 
01:12:48.010 --> 01:12:48.020 align:start position:0%
therefore are subject to 30-day notices
 
01:12:51.050 --> 01:12:51.060 align:start position:0%
it's come to my attention that in some
 
01:12:52.790 --> 01:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
communities the supervisors of the
 
01:12:55.250 --> 01:12:55.260 align:start position:0%
checklist are only meeting at the
 
01:12:57.709 --> 01:12:57.719 align:start position:0%
required meetings immediately before the
 
01:12:59.810 --> 01:12:59.820 align:start position:0%
elections and they're not meeting sooner
 
01:13:02.149 --> 01:13:02.159 align:start position:0%
in order to deal with potential 30-day
 
01:13:02.159 --> 01:13:03.290 align:start position:0%
in order to deal with potential 30-day
notices

01:13:03.290 --> 01:13:03.300 align:start position:0%
notices
 
01:13:06.350 --> 01:13:06.360 align:start position:0%
by requiring them to meet every 45 days
 
01:13:08.390 --> 01:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
it would give an opportunity to clear
 
01:13:10.850 --> 01:13:10.860 align:start position:0%
out those notices that would be the
 
01:13:12.890 --> 01:13:12.900 align:start position:0%
shortest possible time because if you're
 
01:13:15.229 --> 01:13:15.239 align:start position:0%
going to mail a 30-day notice and then
 
01:13:17.030 --> 01:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
receive it you couldn't do it any
 
01:13:18.709 --> 01:13:18.719 align:start position:0%
shorter than that
 
01:13:20.510 --> 01:13:20.520 align:start position:0%
um I definitely understand that if we're
 
01:13:23.090 --> 01:13:23.100 align:start position:0%
to require some frequency of meetings
 
01:13:25.430 --> 01:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
those should be waived if there's no
 
01:13:27.649 --> 01:13:27.659 align:start position:0%
notifications to be made and it should
 
01:13:30.050 --> 01:13:30.060 align:start position:0%
be maybe 60 or 90 days but that's
 
01:13:31.430 --> 01:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
something that I would leave to the
 
01:13:33.530 --> 01:13:33.540 align:start position:0%
committee and their input there is
 
01:13:36.890 --> 01:13:36.900 align:start position:0%
another potential solution too we may
 
01:13:39.590 --> 01:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
want to put a limitation on how long
 
01:13:41.510 --> 01:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
supervisors of the chocolate checklist
 
01:13:45.770 --> 01:13:45.780 align:start position:0%
have to act upon a reason to notify an
 
01:13:47.570 --> 01:13:47.580 align:start position:0%
individual that they are to be removed
 
01:13:49.370 --> 01:13:49.380 align:start position:0%
there potentially to be removed from the
 
01:13:52.010 --> 01:13:52.020 align:start position:0%
checklist we could say that or you could
 
01:13:54.530 --> 01:13:54.540 align:start position:0%
choose to say that within 90 days a
 
01:13:57.110 --> 01:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
30-day notice would need to be sent or
 
01:13:59.209 --> 01:13:59.219 align:start position:0%
it could be done by these meetings I'm
 
01:14:01.610 --> 01:14:01.620 align:start position:0%
open to either approach but I do want to
 
01:14:04.070 --> 01:14:04.080 align:start position:0%
make sure that the this ongoing
 
01:14:05.870 --> 01:14:05.880 align:start position:0%
maintenance does happen in a timely
 
01:14:08.330 --> 01:14:08.340 align:start position:0%
manner that people are removed removed
 
01:14:10.550 --> 01:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
appropriately and that also we don't
 
01:14:12.649 --> 01:14:12.659 align:start position:0%
accidentally remove people just before
 
01:14:14.630 --> 01:14:14.640 align:start position:0%
the election because they missed their
 
01:14:16.370 --> 01:14:16.380 align:start position:0%
mail I think that there should be more
 
01:14:18.050 --> 01:14:18.060 align:start position:0%
opportunities for this and it should be
 
01:14:20.450 --> 01:14:20.460 align:start position:0%
dealt with on an ongoing basis so that's
 
01:14:22.970 --> 01:14:22.980 align:start position:0%
the Genesis of the bill and I am open to
 
01:14:25.370 --> 01:14:25.380 align:start position:0%
questions and better solutions to this
 
01:14:28.810 --> 01:14:28.820 align:start position:0%
problem questions from the committee
 
01:14:32.990 --> 01:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
okay well that oh episode of Lane
 
01:14:37.970 --> 01:14:37.980 align:start position:0%
thank you um you mentioned uh not doing
 
01:14:40.850 --> 01:14:40.860 align:start position:0%
it a certain like not doing it before a
 
01:14:43.610 --> 01:14:43.620 align:start position:0%
certain time and I I guess before the
 
01:14:45.290 --> 01:14:45.300 align:start position:0%
election and I might question you with
 
01:14:47.209 --> 01:14:47.219 align:start position:0%
what would that recommendation be so
 
01:14:49.070 --> 01:14:49.080 align:start position:0%
that people don't show up at the poll
 
01:14:52.070 --> 01:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
and be told that I'm sorry you're no
 
01:14:54.050 --> 01:14:54.060 align:start position:0%
longer registered
 
01:14:55.970 --> 01:14:55.980 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question
 
01:14:57.770 --> 01:14:57.780 align:start position:0%
um I believe that the super the
 
01:14:59.630 --> 01:14:59.640 align:start position:0%
checklist is essentially locked a
 
01:15:01.310 --> 01:15:01.320 align:start position:0%
certain time before the election it's
 
01:15:02.750 --> 01:15:02.760 align:start position:0%
just I believe just bullet for the
 
01:15:05.630 --> 01:15:05.640 align:start position:0%
filing deadline and so statutorily the
 
01:15:07.370 --> 01:15:07.380 align:start position:0%
supervisors need to meet a certain
 
01:15:09.229 --> 01:15:09.239 align:start position:0%
amount of time before that in order to
 
01:15:11.870 --> 01:15:11.880 align:start position:0%
process these requests what I'm asking
 
01:15:14.209 --> 01:15:14.219 align:start position:0%
is for there to be a mechanism for
 
01:15:16.370 --> 01:15:16.380 align:start position:0%
supervisors to be required to meet more
 
01:15:21.110 --> 01:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
frequently if if they do have notices to
 
01:15:23.630 --> 01:15:23.640 align:start position:0%
process or to have a required meeting
 
01:15:25.610 --> 01:15:25.620 align:start position:0%
that could be waived if there were no
 
01:15:28.490 --> 01:15:28.500 align:start position:0%
outstanding requests okay thank you for
 
01:15:30.709 --> 01:15:30.719 align:start position:0%
the question representative weary so so
 
01:15:32.990 --> 01:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:15:35.390 --> 01:15:35.400 align:start position:0%
your testimony uh so with the timing of
 
01:15:38.149 --> 01:15:38.159 align:start position:0%
the various you know local elections or
 
01:15:40.610 --> 01:15:40.620 align:start position:0%
city elections and
 
01:15:40.620 --> 01:15:41.689 align:start position:0%
city elections and
um

01:15:41.689 --> 01:15:41.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:43.910 --> 01:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
I'm just I'm just sort of wondering
 
01:15:47.390 --> 01:15:47.400 align:start position:0%
about uh how that all gets timed out so
 
01:15:51.070 --> 01:15:51.080 align:start position:0%
as not to preclude anybody from being
 
01:15:54.169 --> 01:15:54.179 align:start position:0%
removed from a list prior to you know on
 
01:15:57.530 --> 01:15:57.540 align:start position:0%
an ongoing election cycle in for towns
 
01:15:59.810 --> 01:15:59.820 align:start position:0%
in March and cities you know a few
 
01:16:02.030 --> 01:16:02.040 align:start position:0%
months later and and then primaries and
 
01:16:02.040 --> 01:16:03.050 align:start position:0%
months later and and then primaries and
then

01:16:03.050 --> 01:16:03.060 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:16:05.229 --> 01:16:05.239 align:start position:0%
uh you know those sorts of things
 
01:16:07.790 --> 01:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
obviously ongoing maintenance needs to
 
01:16:09.229 --> 01:16:09.239 align:start position:0%
be made but do you have any
 
01:16:11.450 --> 01:16:11.460 align:start position:0%
recommendations along those lines
 
01:16:12.950 --> 01:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question right now
 
01:16:15.290 --> 01:16:15.300 align:start position:0%
they do meet just before those election
 
01:16:17.870 --> 01:16:17.880 align:start position:0%
events but those are the only times that
 
01:16:20.149 --> 01:16:20.159 align:start position:0%
they're required by law to meet if you
 
01:16:22.850 --> 01:16:22.860 align:start position:0%
have a large stack of say 200 requests
 
01:16:25.070 --> 01:16:25.080 align:start position:0%
to send out you may or may not have the
 
01:16:27.050 --> 01:16:27.060 align:start position:0%
time to to deal with all of those in
 
01:16:29.390 --> 01:16:29.400 align:start position:0%
that time frame I know in Dairy at the
 
01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:30.490 align:start position:0%
that time frame I know in Dairy at the
10-year

01:16:30.490 --> 01:16:30.500 align:start position:0%
10-year
 
01:16:33.530 --> 01:16:33.540 align:start position:0%
checklist maintenance there have been so
 
01:16:35.750 --> 01:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
many that they handle those in processes
 
01:16:37.250 --> 01:16:37.260 align:start position:0%
so those are the ones that happen every
 
01:16:40.070 --> 01:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
decade and right after the census you go
 
01:16:41.870 --> 01:16:41.880 align:start position:0%
through and anybody who hasn't voted in
 
01:16:44.689 --> 01:16:44.699 align:start position:0%
four years receives one of these notices
 
01:16:44.699 --> 01:16:45.410 align:start position:0%
four years receives one of these notices
um

01:16:45.410 --> 01:16:45.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:47.870 --> 01:16:47.880 align:start position:0%
because the volume is so high they need
 
01:16:49.430 --> 01:16:49.440 align:start position:0%
to meet more frequently in order to
 
01:16:52.010 --> 01:16:52.020 align:start position:0%
process it in a reasonable way if you
 
01:16:54.830 --> 01:16:54.840 align:start position:0%
have a town where there are a lot of
 
01:16:58.070 --> 01:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
these potential notices you may have
 
01:16:59.870 --> 01:16:59.880 align:start position:0%
several hundred and if you're trying to
 
01:17:01.669 --> 01:17:01.679 align:start position:0%
deal with those while dealing with all
 
01:17:02.930 --> 01:17:02.940 align:start position:0%
of the other routine checklist
 
01:17:05.689 --> 01:17:05.699 align:start position:0%
maintenance at one meeting that's a huge
 
01:17:08.870 --> 01:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
burden and having a way to spread this
 
01:17:11.090 --> 01:17:11.100 align:start position:0%
out where the supervisors would need to
 
01:17:12.950 --> 01:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
meet more frequently if they did have
 
01:17:16.010 --> 01:17:16.020 align:start position:0%
pending requests would help smooth that
 
01:17:18.830 --> 01:17:18.840 align:start position:0%
curve and smooth their workload so that
 
01:17:21.410 --> 01:17:21.420 align:start position:0%
they could meet before that handle these
 
01:17:22.970 --> 01:17:22.980 align:start position:0%
requests and then deal with the very
 
01:17:24.950 --> 01:17:24.960 align:start position:0%
important maintenance that happens just
 
01:17:26.870 --> 01:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
before the primaries and the town
 
01:17:29.570 --> 01:17:29.580 align:start position:0%
elections in the general
 
01:17:31.010 --> 01:17:31.020 align:start position:0%
for the person it's represent Meerhead
 
01:17:33.590 --> 01:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:17:35.930 --> 01:17:35.940 align:start position:0%
how often are supervisors required to
 
01:17:38.090 --> 01:17:38.100 align:start position:0%
meet now thank you for the question
 
01:17:40.850 --> 01:17:40.860 align:start position:0%
right now they're required to meet one
 
01:17:42.590 --> 01:17:42.600 align:start position:0%
or two times before each of the times
 
01:17:44.930 --> 01:17:44.940 align:start position:0%
that the checklist closes I should have
 
01:17:46.729 --> 01:17:46.739 align:start position:0%
brought that specific language but it's
 
01:17:49.310 --> 01:17:49.320 align:start position:0%
only immediately before elections before
 
01:17:51.110 --> 01:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
this checklist is closed
 
01:17:53.750 --> 01:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow
 
01:17:56.390 --> 01:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
you're proposing that they meet twice a
 
01:17:58.610 --> 01:17:58.620 align:start position:0%
quarter about eight times a year is that
 
01:17:58.620 --> 01:17:59.810 align:start position:0%
quarter about eight times a year is that
correct

01:17:59.810 --> 01:17:59.820 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:18:01.729 --> 01:18:01.739 align:start position:0%
um that is what the language is that is
 
01:18:04.189 --> 01:18:04.199 align:start position:0%
the most frequently that I think anybody
 
01:18:06.110 --> 01:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
could rationally expect them to meet for
 
01:18:09.410 --> 01:18:09.420 align:start position:0%
30-day notices I fully expect that if we
 
01:18:12.290 --> 01:18:12.300 align:start position:0%
go with periodic meetings that it would
 
01:18:14.330 --> 01:18:14.340 align:start position:0%
be longer than 45 days but I know it's
 
01:18:15.950 --> 01:18:15.960 align:start position:0%
always harder to Shorter a Time shorten
 
01:18:17.630 --> 01:18:17.640 align:start position:0%
a time frame so I thought it best to
 
01:18:19.970 --> 01:18:19.980 align:start position:0%
start with the shortest possible and so
 
01:18:21.830 --> 01:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
the highest frequency and then find
 
01:18:25.810 --> 01:18:25.820 align:start position:0%
where that reasonable time frame is
 
01:18:27.950 --> 01:18:27.960 align:start position:0%
are you aware whether whether
 
01:18:29.390 --> 01:18:29.400 align:start position:0%
supervisors of the checklists are
 
01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:31.370 align:start position:0%
supervisors of the checklists are
compensated

01:18:31.370 --> 01:18:31.380 align:start position:0%
compensated
 
01:18:32.570 --> 01:18:32.580 align:start position:0%
um thank you I believe they're better
 
01:18:34.610 --> 01:18:34.620 align:start position:0%
compensated than we are
 
01:18:36.830 --> 01:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
it's a bar solo you could trip over it
 
01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:39.890 align:start position:0%
it's a bar solo you could trip over it
okay

01:18:39.890 --> 01:18:39.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:41.630 --> 01:18:41.640 align:start position:0%
you have further questions
 
01:18:43.130 --> 01:18:43.140 align:start position:0%
I representative Hamlet
 
01:18:43.140 --> 01:18:45.490 align:start position:0%
I representative Hamlet
oops

01:18:45.490 --> 01:18:45.500 align:start position:0%
oops
 
01:18:48.950 --> 01:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
01:18:48.960 --> 01:18:49.610 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
um

01:18:49.610 --> 01:18:49.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:51.050 --> 01:18:51.060 align:start position:0%
I think
 
01:18:53.930 --> 01:18:53.940 align:start position:0%
this bill is better better than the I
 
01:18:56.390 --> 01:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
think this is a great bill and I I
 
01:18:59.390 --> 01:18:59.400 align:start position:0%
because in Portsmouth the supervisors of
 
01:19:01.550 --> 01:19:01.560 align:start position:0%
the checklist meet every month
 
01:19:04.189 --> 01:19:04.199 align:start position:0%
and they re you know clean up the
 
01:19:06.290 --> 01:19:06.300 align:start position:0%
checklist every month so
 
01:19:08.570 --> 01:19:08.580 align:start position:0%
um and I was surprised to recently find
 
01:19:10.430 --> 01:19:10.440 align:start position:0%
out that and sometimes they don't meet
 
01:19:15.229 --> 01:19:15.239 align:start position:0%
everyone's so it seems like the year 6
 
01:19:19.250 --> 01:19:19.260 align:start position:0%
27 a is is better
 
01:19:25.669 --> 01:19:25.679 align:start position:0%
than uh just 6 27. can can we just amend
 
01:19:30.890 --> 01:19:30.900 align:start position:0%
the wording uh in 65427 instead of
 
01:19:34.370 --> 01:19:34.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:37.070 --> 01:19:37.080 align:start position:0%
um so I I my first question is is the
 
01:19:39.290 --> 01:19:39.300 align:start position:0%
627 the one that requires them to meet
 
01:19:42.229 --> 01:19:42.239 align:start position:0%
just before every election yes
 
01:19:43.729 --> 01:19:43.739 align:start position:0%
um thank you I think it should be in
 
01:19:45.709 --> 01:19:45.719 align:start position:0%
addition to that because if you were to
 
01:19:47.689 --> 01:19:47.699 align:start position:0%
schedule the meetings and then be 44
 
01:19:50.209 --> 01:19:50.219 align:start position:0%
days before the best time to update the
 
01:19:52.070 --> 01:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
checklist for the election you could
 
01:19:54.290 --> 01:19:54.300 align:start position:0%
lose some options there too those
 
01:19:56.750 --> 01:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
meetings my intention is that these
 
01:19:59.209 --> 01:19:59.219 align:start position:0%
meetings here would also satisfy that
 
01:20:01.189 --> 01:20:01.199 align:start position:0%
requirement and that it wouldn't be an
 
01:20:03.590 --> 01:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
addition to it wouldn't be on top of it
 
01:20:05.810 --> 01:20:05.820 align:start position:0%
it would just simply add to it so that
 
01:20:07.610 --> 01:20:07.620 align:start position:0%
throughout the year the supervisors were
 
01:20:09.950 --> 01:20:09.960 align:start position:0%
meeting and I'd just like to say that
 
01:20:12.110 --> 01:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
it's fantastic that the supervisors in
 
01:20:15.110 --> 01:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth meet monthly thank you
 
01:20:17.090 --> 01:20:17.100 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
01:20:18.830 --> 01:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
okay seeing nothing representative Leon
 
01:20:22.010 --> 01:20:22.020 align:start position:0%
only one pink card for this
 
01:20:25.689 --> 01:20:25.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:28.490 --> 01:20:28.500 align:start position:0%
Mr Healy you are what is between us and
 
01:20:31.850 --> 01:20:31.860 align:start position:0%
lunch so be wary I'll be quick so Dan
 
01:20:34.070 --> 01:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
Haley uh representing New Hampshire City
 
01:20:37.010 --> 01:20:37.020 align:start position:0%
and town clerks Association uh so we do
 
01:20:39.169 --> 01:20:39.179 align:start position:0%
support this bill
 
01:20:41.270 --> 01:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
um representative Leon spoke to a little
 
01:20:43.189 --> 01:20:43.199 align:start position:0%
bit we would just like the change to be
 
01:20:45.530 --> 01:20:45.540 align:start position:0%
to 60 days
 
01:20:47.750 --> 01:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
um and it's say like supervisors must
 
01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:48.950 align:start position:0%
um and it's say like supervisors must
meet

01:20:48.950 --> 01:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
meet
 
01:20:51.050 --> 01:20:51.060 align:start position:0%
um at minimum within six days because
 
01:20:53.570 --> 01:20:53.580 align:start position:0%
their statutory meeting requirements
 
01:20:54.890 --> 01:20:54.900 align:start position:0%
already in place so if you have a
 
01:20:57.229 --> 01:20:57.239 align:start position:0%
statutory requirement to meet we want to
 
01:20:59.630 --> 01:20:59.640 align:start position:0%
be want to be on a you know the timer
 
01:21:01.910 --> 01:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
should start again after that meeting so
 
01:21:05.930 --> 01:21:05.940 align:start position:0%
we're recommending 60 days or a set
 
01:21:09.590 --> 01:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
amount of days per year say six or ten
 
01:21:12.229 --> 01:21:12.239 align:start position:0%
or whatever it is because of the
 
01:21:14.090 --> 01:21:14.100 align:start position:0%
statutory requirements already in place
 
01:21:16.010 --> 01:21:16.020 align:start position:0%
to meet on certain days so you wouldn't
 
01:21:18.290 --> 01:21:18.300 align:start position:0%
want to say like every 45 days they need
 
01:21:20.930 --> 01:21:20.940 align:start position:0%
to meet because they're meeting anyway
 
01:21:24.169 --> 01:21:24.179 align:start position:0%
so our only recommendation would be the
 
01:21:26.570 --> 01:21:26.580 align:start position:0%
60 days instead of 40 five but we do
 
01:21:29.930 --> 01:21:29.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:32.149 --> 01:21:32.159 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee look at
 
01:21:34.370 --> 01:21:34.380 align:start position:0%
that see when you threaten lunch no one
 
01:21:35.330 --> 01:21:35.340 align:start position:0%
wants to ask questions all right thank
 
01:21:37.370 --> 01:21:37.380 align:start position:0%
you uh representative can you grab us
 
01:21:50.090 --> 01:21:50.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:53.810 --> 01:21:53.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:55.669 --> 01:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
okay uh there were two people three
 
01:21:57.830 --> 01:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
people signed in two against one four
 
01:21:59.930 --> 01:21:59.940 align:start position:0%
um when with that I will close the here
 
01:22:03.229 --> 01:22:03.239 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on House Bill 316. uh
 
01:22:05.330 --> 01:22:05.340 align:start position:0%
we will reconvene
 
01:22:09.350 --> 01:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
um at one o'clock for HP 415 uh enjoy a
 
01:23:06.830 --> 01:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:06.840 --> 03:04:07.070 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:04:07.070 --> 03:04:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:10.330 --> 03:04:10.340 align:start position:0%
okay thank you oh this is very loud here
 
03:04:12.889 --> 03:04:12.899 align:start position:0%
I'll back up
 
03:04:15.230 --> 03:04:15.240 align:start position:0%
thank you committee for your time and
 
03:04:18.650 --> 03:04:18.660 align:start position:0%
listening to hb415 I'm here to introduce
 
03:04:20.330 --> 03:04:20.340 align:start position:0%
this bill on behalf of the sponsor
 
03:04:22.610 --> 03:04:22.620 align:start position:0%
representative panic
 
03:04:24.410 --> 03:04:24.420 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State commissioned the
 
03:04:26.030 --> 03:04:26.040 align:start position:0%
committee for voter confidence and
 
03:04:28.429 --> 03:04:28.439 align:start position:0%
testimony revealed that half of those
 
03:04:30.469 --> 03:04:30.479 align:start position:0%
who came forward had concerns about New
 
03:04:32.630 --> 03:04:32.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's elections we need to take
 
03:04:35.170 --> 03:04:35.180 align:start position:0%
steps to improve this confidence level
 
03:04:37.969 --> 03:04:37.979 align:start position:0%
and one very important way of doing this
 
03:04:40.849 --> 03:04:40.859 align:start position:0%
is by creating election transparency
 
03:04:42.950 --> 03:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
we have many people in New Hampshire who
 
03:04:45.530 --> 03:04:45.540 align:start position:0%
are concerned about our voting machines
 
03:04:47.630 --> 03:04:47.640 align:start position:0%
with the results of the Wyndham audit
 
03:04:49.490 --> 03:04:49.500 align:start position:0%
demonstrating issues that rendered
 
03:04:51.710 --> 03:04:51.720 align:start position:0%
incorrect results many have become
 
03:04:53.990 --> 03:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
election Skeptics and they have no way
 
03:04:56.269 --> 03:04:56.279 align:start position:0%
to lessen their concerns as voters
 
03:04:58.490 --> 03:04:58.500 align:start position:0%
cannot see the ballots that make up
 
03:05:02.269 --> 03:05:02.279 align:start position:0%
their elections why is this there are no
 
03:05:03.710 --> 03:05:03.720 align:start position:0%
federal laws that prohibit making
 
03:05:05.990 --> 03:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
ballots public information
 
03:05:08.450 --> 03:05:08.460 align:start position:0%
federal law leaves this up to the states
 
03:05:11.510 --> 03:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
to decide so why does the New Hampshire
 
03:05:14.330 --> 03:05:14.340 align:start position:0%
why does New Hampshire prevent access to
 
03:05:17.450 --> 03:05:17.460 align:start position:0%
ballots from 91a requests through
 
03:05:20.330 --> 03:05:20.340 align:start position:0%
research and Records requests it appears
 
03:05:22.730 --> 03:05:22.740 align:start position:0%
that legislation
 
03:05:25.690 --> 03:05:25.700 align:start position:0%
is to exclude ballots and it came off
 
03:05:29.650 --> 03:05:29.660 align:start position:0%
after recount results in the Hampstead
 
03:05:32.030 --> 03:05:32.040 align:start position:0%
elections were overturned when a citizen
 
03:05:34.429 --> 03:05:34.439 align:start position:0%
requested to see the ballots in the late
 
03:05:34.439 --> 03:05:35.450 align:start position:0%
requested to see the ballots in the late
80s

03:05:35.450 --> 03:05:35.460 align:start position:0%
80s
 
03:05:37.250 --> 03:05:37.260 align:start position:0%
this was described in a public
 
03:05:39.349 --> 03:05:39.359 align:start position:0%
selectman's hearing and testimony during
 
03:05:40.969 --> 03:05:40.979 align:start position:0%
the Wyndham audit
 
03:05:44.150 --> 03:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
in 2003 a superior court judge ruled
 
03:05:47.210 --> 03:05:47.220 align:start position:0%
ballots were in fact part of 91a
 
03:05:50.030 --> 03:05:50.040 align:start position:0%
so a request was made by then deputy
 
03:05:52.670 --> 03:05:52.680 align:start position:0%
secretary of state Scanlon and Bud Fitch
 
03:05:54.889 --> 03:05:54.899 align:start position:0%
assistant AG
 
03:05:59.030 --> 03:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
to add an amendment to HB 627 a memo
 
03:06:00.950 --> 03:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
authored by the pair requesting the
 
03:06:04.130 --> 03:06:04.140 align:start position:0%
following add a new section to hb627
 
03:06:06.290 --> 03:06:06.300 align:start position:0%
exempting ballots used for elections
 
03:06:10.070 --> 03:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
from RSA 91a this proposed amendment is
 
03:06:12.889 --> 03:06:12.899 align:start position:0%
prompted by a recent superior court
 
03:06:16.010 --> 03:06:16.020 align:start position:0%
order declaring that the ballots cast in
 
03:06:17.990 --> 03:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
an election are not exempt from the
 
03:06:20.690 --> 03:06:20.700 align:start position:0%
right to no law and requiring a town to
 
03:06:23.929 --> 03:06:23.939 align:start position:0%
provide a person making a 91a request
 
03:06:27.110 --> 03:06:27.120 align:start position:0%
demand to have access to all the ballots
 
03:06:29.690 --> 03:06:29.700 align:start position:0%
preserved from a recent town meeting
 
03:06:31.790 --> 03:06:31.800 align:start position:0%
the Integrity of ballots and the
 
03:06:34.309 --> 03:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
finality of election results requires
 
03:06:36.290 --> 03:06:36.300 align:start position:0%
that there be limited and highly
 
03:06:38.630 --> 03:06:38.640 align:start position:0%
controlled access to the ballots used
 
03:06:40.190 --> 03:06:40.200 align:start position:0%
for elections
 
03:06:42.830 --> 03:06:42.840 align:start position:0%
the existing recount and recount appeal
 
03:06:45.170 --> 03:06:45.180 align:start position:0%
Provisions provide adequate access to
 
03:06:46.610 --> 03:06:46.620 align:start position:0%
ballots under
 
03:06:46.620 --> 03:06:48.530 align:start position:0%
ballots under
circumstances

03:06:48.530 --> 03:06:48.540 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
03:06:50.929 --> 03:06:50.939 align:start position:0%
the logic behind the request is
 
03:06:53.630 --> 03:06:53.640 align:start position:0%
unfortunately flawed every citizen in
 
03:06:55.190 --> 03:06:55.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has the right to election
 
03:06:58.910 --> 03:06:58.920 align:start position:0%
transparency not just candidates who are
 
03:07:01.010 --> 03:07:01.020 align:start position:0%
the only eligible parties to request a
 
03:07:01.020 --> 03:07:02.269 align:start position:0%
the only eligible parties to request a
recount

03:07:02.269 --> 03:07:02.279 align:start position:0%
recount
 
03:07:05.690 --> 03:07:05.700 align:start position:0%
and for their race only after this
 
03:07:07.849 --> 03:07:07.859 align:start position:0%
provision was made law of New Hampshire
 
03:07:10.070 --> 03:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
citizens lost their ability to validate
 
03:07:12.710 --> 03:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
election results making it impossible to
 
03:07:16.130 --> 03:07:16.140 align:start position:0%
tie reported results to votes cast
 
03:07:18.349 --> 03:07:18.359 align:start position:0%
citizens have no ability to ensure the
 
03:07:20.630 --> 03:07:20.640 align:start position:0%
reported election results are in fact
 
03:07:22.670 --> 03:07:22.680 align:start position:0%
the will of the people without using
 
03:07:22.680 --> 03:07:23.809 align:start position:0%
the will of the people without using
ballots

03:07:23.809 --> 03:07:23.819 align:start position:0%
ballots
 
03:07:26.389 --> 03:07:26.399 align:start position:0%
this erodes voter confidence and worse
 
03:07:28.910 --> 03:07:28.920 align:start position:0%
preventing access to ballots adds fuel
 
03:07:31.490 --> 03:07:31.500 align:start position:0%
to the fire that they're being withheld
 
03:07:33.830 --> 03:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
be because of the agenda not because
 
03:07:35.929 --> 03:07:35.939 align:start position:0%
that this is good policy
 
03:07:38.929 --> 03:07:38.939 align:start position:0%
concerns in the past have been raised
 
03:07:41.750 --> 03:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
that public ballot access violates voter
 
03:07:44.269 --> 03:07:44.279 align:start position:0%
privacy however all recounts make
 
03:07:44.279 --> 03:07:45.230 align:start position:0%
privacy however all recounts make
visible

03:07:45.230 --> 03:07:45.240 align:start position:0%
visible
 
03:07:48.050 --> 03:07:48.060 align:start position:0%
every ballot and privacy has never been
 
03:07:49.490 --> 03:07:49.500 align:start position:0%
an issue
 
03:07:51.530 --> 03:07:51.540 align:start position:0%
other concerns about public ballot
 
03:07:53.929 --> 03:07:53.939 align:start position:0%
access centered on voters selling or
 
03:07:56.030 --> 03:07:56.040 align:start position:0%
being coerced to use their ballot and
 
03:07:57.710 --> 03:07:57.720 align:start position:0%
marketing it for future confirmation
 
03:08:00.889 --> 03:08:00.899 align:start position:0%
however technology would allow a simple
 
03:08:03.950 --> 03:08:03.960 align:start position:0%
photo to confirm a voter's ballot
 
03:08:08.090 --> 03:08:08.100 align:start position:0%
so no markings would be needed
 
03:08:10.309 --> 03:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
we recognize public access to ballots
 
03:08:13.070 --> 03:08:13.080 align:start position:0%
will need to be organized and balanced
 
03:08:16.190 --> 03:08:16.200 align:start position:0%
with the workloads of towns but we owe
 
03:08:17.990 --> 03:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
it to our voters to make this happen
 
03:08:20.690 --> 03:08:20.700 align:start position:0%
Public Access is done in other states
 
03:08:22.969 --> 03:08:22.979 align:start position:0%
today and most certainly can be done
 
03:08:25.670 --> 03:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire Vermont uses the
 
03:08:27.469 --> 03:08:27.479 align:start position:0%
identical voting machines and ballots as
 
03:08:29.330 --> 03:08:29.340 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire they make their ballots
 
03:08:31.610 --> 03:08:31.620 align:start position:0%
available to the public this is a great
 
03:08:34.370 --> 03:08:34.380 align:start position:0%
source of voter confidence for Vermont
 
03:08:36.530 --> 03:08:36.540 align:start position:0%
Arizona just passed bipartisan
 
03:08:38.269 --> 03:08:38.279 align:start position:0%
legislation to make all ballot images
 
03:08:41.510 --> 03:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
available to the public by passing HB
 
03:08:41.520 --> 03:08:43.190 align:start position:0%
available to the public by passing HB
2560.

03:08:43.190 --> 03:08:43.200 align:start position:0%
2560.
 
03:08:44.929 --> 03:08:44.939 align:start position:0%
they recognize that their citizens
 
03:08:46.670 --> 03:08:46.680 align:start position:0%
deserve to have the confidence in the
 
03:08:48.710 --> 03:08:48.720 align:start position:0%
election results and one of the most
 
03:08:51.349 --> 03:08:51.359 align:start position:0%
important ways to do this is to make the
 
03:08:52.670 --> 03:08:52.680 align:start position:0%
results Audible
 
03:08:54.889 --> 03:08:54.899 align:start position:0%
through publicly available ballot images
 
03:08:57.110 --> 03:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
so we are asking this committee to
 
03:08:59.030 --> 03:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
restore access to ballots as part of the
 
03:09:00.769 --> 03:09:00.779 align:start position:0%
public record for New Hampshire citizens
 
03:09:03.590 --> 03:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
just like the bipartisan efforts just
 
03:09:05.090 --> 03:09:05.100 align:start position:0%
announced in Arizona
 
03:09:06.950 --> 03:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
03:09:09.290 --> 03:09:09.300 align:start position:0%
for We the People for everyone to be
 
03:09:11.330 --> 03:09:11.340 align:start position:0%
able to verify election results for
 
03:09:11.340 --> 03:09:12.469 align:start position:0%
able to verify election results for
themselves

03:09:12.469 --> 03:09:12.479 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
03:09:14.330 --> 03:09:14.340 align:start position:0%
thank you for listening
 
03:09:17.690 --> 03:09:17.700 align:start position:0%
thank you will you take questions
 
03:09:19.610 --> 03:09:19.620 align:start position:0%
um I
 
03:09:21.830 --> 03:09:21.840 align:start position:0%
okay I'm just introducing it so if
 
03:09:23.570 --> 03:09:23.580 align:start position:0%
there's anybody here that is also
 
03:09:25.370 --> 03:09:25.380 align:start position:0%
supporting you I'll let them yeah thank
 
03:09:27.170 --> 03:09:27.180 align:start position:0%
you thank you
 
03:09:34.190 --> 03:09:34.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:36.349 --> 03:09:36.359 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:09:38.330 --> 03:09:38.340 align:start position:0%
honorable members of the election law
 
03:09:39.530 --> 03:09:39.540 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is
 
03:09:41.389 --> 03:09:41.399 align:start position:0%
Ellen Reed I represent rockinghamton
 
03:09:44.389 --> 03:09:44.399 align:start position:0%
that is Newmark in new fields and I'm
 
03:09:46.849 --> 03:09:46.859 align:start position:0%
coming before you today I am not a
 
03:09:48.590 --> 03:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor I don't think I knew that
 
03:09:51.650 --> 03:09:51.660 align:start position:0%
this was getting filed but I filed this
 
03:09:54.889 --> 03:09:54.899 align:start position:0%
bill in various forms uh I believe 2018
 
03:09:57.170 --> 03:09:57.180 align:start position:0%
the second year I was in office again in
 
03:09:59.630 --> 03:09:59.640 align:start position:0%
2019 in my second term and in my third
 
03:10:01.429 --> 03:10:01.439 align:start position:0%
term I asked the Republican to file it
 
03:10:04.070 --> 03:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
for me thinking maybe someone across the
 
03:10:06.410 --> 03:10:06.420 align:start position:0%
aisle might have more luck than me
 
03:10:09.410 --> 03:10:09.420 align:start position:0%
um so for the record the historically we
 
03:10:12.349 --> 03:10:12.359 align:start position:0%
always had ballots available as 91a
 
03:10:15.290 --> 03:10:15.300 align:start position:0%
public documents as a matter of
 
03:10:17.330 --> 03:10:17.340 align:start position:0%
transparency it is in our state
 
03:10:20.030 --> 03:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
constitution that elections shall be
 
03:10:22.030 --> 03:10:22.040 align:start position:0%
counted and I'm sure you heard earlier
 
03:10:24.469 --> 03:10:24.479 align:start position:0%
tabulated may be different than counted
 
03:10:26.389 --> 03:10:26.399 align:start position:0%
or may not be
 
03:10:28.190 --> 03:10:28.200 align:start position:0%
um but the idea I think the spirit of
 
03:10:30.110 --> 03:10:30.120 align:start position:0%
that part of the Constitution is that
 
03:10:33.469 --> 03:10:33.479 align:start position:0%
everything has to be done in public and
 
03:10:36.349 --> 03:10:36.359 align:start position:0%
certainly that is the Constitution says
 
03:10:38.450 --> 03:10:38.460 align:start position:0%
that we have to do these things in
 
03:10:41.269 --> 03:10:41.279 align:start position:0%
public in the open
 
03:10:43.610 --> 03:10:43.620 align:start position:0%
um the history and I won't speak I think
 
03:10:45.590 --> 03:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
the previous testimony spoke a little
 
03:10:47.870 --> 03:10:47.880 align:start position:0%
bit to the history of why
 
03:10:50.269 --> 03:10:50.279 align:start position:0%
um it was removed from 91a but the
 
03:10:51.950 --> 03:10:51.960 align:start position:0%
actual mechanism by which it was removed
 
03:10:55.010 --> 03:10:55.020 align:start position:0%
from 91a I find suspect it was put into
 
03:10:57.889 --> 03:10:57.899 align:start position:0%
a bill it was a non-germane amendment in
 
03:11:00.230 --> 03:11:00.240 align:start position:0%
the Senate side in a bill and that
 
03:11:01.730 --> 03:11:01.740 align:start position:0%
non-germaine amendment that removed
 
03:11:05.210 --> 03:11:05.220 align:start position:0%
ballots is 91a documents uh did not have
 
03:11:09.230 --> 03:11:09.240 align:start position:0%
a hearing so I find that problematic on
 
03:11:11.929 --> 03:11:11.939 align:start position:0%
its face but here we are today without
 
03:11:15.950 --> 03:11:15.960 align:start position:0%
ballots being 91a
 
03:11:18.469 --> 03:11:18.479 align:start position:0%
um I so as I said I've I've Prime
 
03:11:20.090 --> 03:11:20.100 align:start position:0%
sponsored this and assisted in this
 
03:11:22.849 --> 03:11:22.859 align:start position:0%
being Prime sponsored three times prior
 
03:11:25.070 --> 03:11:25.080 align:start position:0%
all of which were prior or I think all
 
03:11:26.929 --> 03:11:26.939 align:start position:0%
of which at least two of which were
 
03:11:29.090 --> 03:11:29.100 align:start position:0%
prior to the 2020 election and I really
 
03:11:32.210 --> 03:11:32.220 align:start position:0%
feel strongly that if we had had this in
 
03:11:34.130 --> 03:11:34.140 align:start position:0%
place we may have at least as a state
 
03:11:37.429 --> 03:11:37.439 align:start position:0%
experience less divisiveness during the
 
03:11:40.429 --> 03:11:40.439 align:start position:0%
2020 election because my Approach has
 
03:11:43.130 --> 03:11:43.140 align:start position:0%
always been since way before it became a
 
03:11:45.769 --> 03:11:45.779 align:start position:0%
you know a major topic of national
 
03:11:48.110 --> 03:11:48.120 align:start position:0%
discourse that
 
03:11:50.870 --> 03:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
sunlight is the best disinfectant if you
 
03:11:52.730 --> 03:11:52.740 align:start position:0%
that that conspiracy theories cannot
 
03:11:56.170 --> 03:11:56.180 align:start position:0%
grow in complete and pure transparency
 
03:11:58.969 --> 03:11:58.979 align:start position:0%
so while I may not believe that there's
 
03:12:00.769 --> 03:12:00.779 align:start position:0%
any you know
 
03:12:03.349 --> 03:12:03.359 align:start position:0%
bad things afoot with how ballots are
 
03:12:05.269 --> 03:12:05.279 align:start position:0%
counted it doesn't matter what I believe
 
03:12:07.309 --> 03:12:07.319 align:start position:0%
what matters is what other people have
 
03:12:09.950 --> 03:12:09.960 align:start position:0%
informed have information for and if we
 
03:12:12.590 --> 03:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
are completely transparent about it then
 
03:12:14.870 --> 03:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
we can't have you just don't have an
 
03:12:16.250 --> 03:12:16.260 align:start position:0%
environment where conspiracy theories
 
03:12:20.030 --> 03:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
can take off and as as a prime sponsor
 
03:12:23.230 --> 03:12:23.240 align:start position:0%
of this in 2018 and 2019 I'm on record
 
03:12:26.269 --> 03:12:26.279 align:start position:0%
with that position long before any of
 
03:12:29.450 --> 03:12:29.460 align:start position:0%
those conversations got started
 
03:12:32.330 --> 03:12:32.340 align:start position:0%
so for the record my bills and prior had
 
03:12:33.889 --> 03:12:33.899 align:start position:0%
some slightly different language I'd
 
03:12:35.269 --> 03:12:35.279 align:start position:0%
like to just tell you really briefly
 
03:12:37.490 --> 03:12:37.500 align:start position:0%
about it in case for whatever reason the
 
03:12:39.530 --> 03:12:39.540 align:start position:0%
committee sees fit to try to amend this
 
03:12:42.170 --> 03:12:42.180 align:start position:0%
particular one my bill and this is a
 
03:12:44.630 --> 03:12:44.640 align:start position:0%
little bit outside the the realm of just
 
03:12:46.790 --> 03:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
this bill but I allowed moderators to do
 
03:12:49.490 --> 03:12:49.500 align:start position:0%
public audits of machines random audits
 
03:12:50.870 --> 03:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
of a particular race and particular
 
03:12:53.750 --> 03:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
machine I allowed the townspeople to buy
 
03:12:57.170 --> 03:12:57.180 align:start position:0%
petition before the election ask for a
 
03:12:59.630 --> 03:12:59.640 align:start position:0%
random audit of a machine just to verify
 
03:13:02.090 --> 03:13:02.100 align:start position:0%
that the machines are producing reliable
 
03:13:06.110 --> 03:13:06.120 align:start position:0%
results and I also had in my previous
 
03:13:08.210 --> 03:13:08.220 align:start position:0%
iterations of this bill very specific
 
03:13:11.330 --> 03:13:11.340 align:start position:0%
language exempting ballots that had
 
03:13:14.870 --> 03:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
identifiable markings and ballots that
 
03:13:17.090 --> 03:13:17.100 align:start position:0%
for example absentee ballots look
 
03:13:19.250 --> 03:13:19.260 align:start position:0%
different so if you had a district where
 
03:13:21.110 --> 03:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
maybe you only had two people vote
 
03:13:23.210 --> 03:13:23.220 align:start position:0%
absentee those would be Exempted because
 
03:13:25.490 --> 03:13:25.500 align:start position:0%
it would be too narrow of a field of
 
03:13:26.990 --> 03:13:27.000 align:start position:0%
people you could potentially narrow it
 
03:13:30.590 --> 03:13:30.600 align:start position:0%
down to who had what ballot so so
 
03:13:32.030 --> 03:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
um if the committee is interested in
 
03:13:33.590 --> 03:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
that language I'm happy to provide it to
 
03:13:35.870 --> 03:13:35.880 align:start position:0%
you if you want if you see fit that the
 
03:13:37.250 --> 03:13:37.260 align:start position:0%
the incentive of the bill is good but
 
03:13:39.349 --> 03:13:39.359 align:start position:0%
you want to get into the Weeds on
 
03:13:39.359 --> 03:13:40.929 align:start position:0%
you want to get into the Weeds on
language

03:13:40.929 --> 03:13:40.939 align:start position:0%
language
 
03:13:43.370 --> 03:13:43.380 align:start position:0%
the only argument that I ever heard
 
03:13:46.370 --> 03:13:46.380 align:start position:0%
against this that I can recall and the
 
03:13:49.010 --> 03:13:49.020 align:start position:0%
many times that I had presented it
 
03:13:52.730 --> 03:13:52.740 align:start position:0%
um was that there was a bit of concern
 
03:13:55.550 --> 03:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
around the concept of buying a vote so
 
03:13:58.429 --> 03:13:58.439 align:start position:0%
the idea that someone could say that
 
03:14:00.230 --> 03:14:00.240 align:start position:0%
I'll accept money in order to vote a
 
03:14:01.610 --> 03:14:01.620 align:start position:0%
certain way then they vote a certain way
 
03:14:03.769 --> 03:14:03.779 align:start position:0%
that's 91a now it's completely
 
03:14:06.110 --> 03:14:06.120 align:start position:0%
accessible to the public and then I
 
03:14:09.110 --> 03:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
could go and check I found this argument
 
03:14:11.330 --> 03:14:11.340 align:start position:0%
absolutely but to be frank quite
 
03:14:13.730 --> 03:14:13.740 align:start position:0%
ridiculous so first of all you can take
 
03:14:16.730 --> 03:14:16.740 align:start position:0%
a picture of your ballot as we know and
 
03:14:20.389 --> 03:14:20.399 align:start position:0%
that would suffice as proof of your vote
 
03:14:22.370 --> 03:14:22.380 align:start position:0%
if you were to be a bad actor and sell
 
03:14:24.830 --> 03:14:24.840 align:start position:0%
your vote but if you were a bad actor
 
03:14:27.469 --> 03:14:27.479 align:start position:0%
and tried to buy a vote I would strongly
 
03:14:29.870 --> 03:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
warn against the idea of going and
 
03:14:32.929 --> 03:14:32.939 align:start position:0%
requesting a 91a record on those ballots
 
03:14:35.330 --> 03:14:35.340 align:start position:0%
to then basically admit that you have
 
03:14:37.910 --> 03:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
bought a vote it would be an impractical
 
03:14:40.490 --> 03:14:40.500 align:start position:0%
way to verify that illegally bought vote
 
03:14:43.550 --> 03:14:43.560 align:start position:0%
and a very transparent way of of showing
 
03:14:45.889 --> 03:14:45.899 align:start position:0%
that you are probably not a great actor
 
03:14:48.530 --> 03:14:48.540 align:start position:0%
but as I said in my previous bills I did
 
03:14:50.830 --> 03:14:50.840 align:start position:0%
exempt personally identifying
 
03:14:54.110 --> 03:14:54.120 align:start position:0%
marked ballots from that bill and with
 
03:14:55.969 --> 03:14:55.979 align:start position:0%
that I'm happy to attempt to answer any
 
03:14:55.979 --> 03:14:57.349 align:start position:0%
that I'm happy to attempt to answer any
questions

03:14:57.349 --> 03:14:57.359 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:14:59.750 --> 03:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
thank you we have any questions
 
03:15:01.550 --> 03:15:01.560 align:start position:0%
representative weary
 
03:15:03.050 --> 03:15:03.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you
 
03:15:06.110 --> 03:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
representative Reed for your testimony
 
03:15:06.120 --> 03:15:07.910 align:start position:0%
representative Reed for your testimony
um

03:15:07.910 --> 03:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:15:10.130 --> 03:15:10.140 align:start position:0%
just curious if your previous bills
 
03:15:12.050 --> 03:15:12.060 align:start position:0%
addressed the concept of ballot images
 
03:15:16.070 --> 03:15:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:19.130 --> 03:15:19.140 align:start position:0%
no I don't I don't so what you mean like
 
03:15:21.070 --> 03:15:21.080 align:start position:0%
the actual Counseling of ballots versus
 
03:15:23.750 --> 03:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
the access to the image so it's just the
 
03:15:25.370 --> 03:15:25.380 align:start position:0%
image and again my language also
 
03:15:25.380 --> 03:15:26.570 align:start position:0%
image and again my language also
included

03:15:26.570 --> 03:15:26.580 align:start position:0%
included
 
03:15:29.150 --> 03:15:29.160 align:start position:0%
um guidelines around how that would be
 
03:15:31.910 --> 03:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
available so for example like we do with
 
03:15:31.920 --> 03:15:33.349 align:start position:0%
available so for example like we do with
recounts

03:15:33.349 --> 03:15:33.359 align:start position:0%
recounts
 
03:15:35.870 --> 03:15:35.880 align:start position:0%
um uh you can have like screens and then
 
03:15:37.070 --> 03:15:37.080 align:start position:0%
there's a person in the other room
 
03:15:39.530 --> 03:15:39.540 align:start position:0%
showing you the ballot over a screen and
 
03:15:41.330 --> 03:15:41.340 align:start position:0%
then you can say okay next Ballot or
 
03:15:43.670 --> 03:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
look at this part or what have you so it
 
03:15:46.010 --> 03:15:46.020 align:start position:0%
doesn't require the person being in
 
03:15:47.570 --> 03:15:47.580 align:start position:0%
person with the ballot or physically
 
03:15:49.490 --> 03:15:49.500 align:start position:0%
touching the ballot and you can also if
 
03:15:51.530 --> 03:15:51.540 align:start position:0%
once we had the technology have the
 
03:15:53.809 --> 03:15:53.819 align:start position:0%
valid images available
 
03:15:57.590 --> 03:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
well follow up Mr chair
 
03:15:59.510 --> 03:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
so so
 
03:16:01.610 --> 03:16:01.620 align:start position:0%
you're not asked this doesn't make a
 
03:16:04.309 --> 03:16:04.319 align:start position:0%
provision necessarily for a recount per
 
03:16:08.510 --> 03:16:08.520 align:start position:0%
se but just access to ballot images so
 
03:16:11.929 --> 03:16:11.939 align:start position:0%
that people can go in and verify it
 
03:16:14.330 --> 03:16:14.340 align:start position:0%
right without without the mechanisms of
 
03:16:17.210 --> 03:16:17.220 align:start position:0%
a recount correct exactly precisely so
 
03:16:19.429 --> 03:16:19.439 align:start position:0%
we don't have machines currently that
 
03:16:20.870 --> 03:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
automatically create valid images
 
03:16:22.790 --> 03:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
although I'm sure that whatever machine
 
03:16:25.550 --> 03:16:25.560 align:start position:0%
we end up with probably will have that
 
03:16:28.849 --> 03:16:28.859 align:start position:0%
ability but this like any other 91a
 
03:16:31.130 --> 03:16:31.140 align:start position:0%
request this simply allows us to be
 
03:16:33.650 --> 03:16:33.660 align:start position:0%
transparent so that anyone could see oh
 
03:16:36.710 --> 03:16:36.720 align:start position:0%
yeah it really was 300 votes that voted
 
03:16:39.530 --> 03:16:39.540 align:start position:0%
for this candidate for example so it's
 
03:16:41.510 --> 03:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
just the ability to see the actual
 
03:16:43.670 --> 03:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
ballots which I think is completely in
 
03:16:45.110 --> 03:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
keeping with the spirit of the
 
03:16:46.429 --> 03:16:46.439 align:start position:0%
Constitution that says that we have to
 
03:16:48.349 --> 03:16:48.359 align:start position:0%
do this in public
 
03:16:53.389 --> 03:16:53.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:54.889 --> 03:16:54.899 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
03:16:54.899 --> 03:16:56.090 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
question

03:16:56.090 --> 03:16:56.100 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:16:58.550 --> 03:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
in your previous bills and in this bill
 
03:17:01.790 --> 03:17:01.800 align:start position:0%
is there a time frame by which someone
 
03:17:04.130 --> 03:17:04.140 align:start position:0%
would be able to make this request or a
 
03:17:05.170 --> 03:17:05.180 align:start position:0%
time limit
 
03:17:09.349 --> 03:17:09.359 align:start position:0%
there's there's not and uh to the extent
 
03:17:11.450 --> 03:17:11.460 align:start position:0%
that there is a time limit for the
 
03:17:14.570 --> 03:17:14.580 align:start position:0%
government to respond to a 91a request I
 
03:17:16.309 --> 03:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
understand that is also a topic that's
 
03:17:19.250 --> 03:17:19.260 align:start position:0%
being legislated currently but um that
 
03:17:21.290 --> 03:17:21.300 align:start position:0%
it's it's a pretty squishy but the
 
03:17:23.809 --> 03:17:23.819 align:start position:0%
government is expected to respond to 91a
 
03:17:25.910 --> 03:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
requests in a timely manner follow it
 
03:17:29.450 --> 03:17:29.460 align:start position:0%
please follow up thank you so
 
03:17:32.450 --> 03:17:32.460 align:start position:0%
under 91a someone can request records
 
03:17:32.460 --> 03:17:33.830 align:start position:0%
under 91a someone can request records
from

03:17:33.830 --> 03:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
from
 
03:17:38.290 --> 03:17:38.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:41.170 --> 03:17:41.180 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to understand if this bill
 
03:17:44.330 --> 03:17:44.340 align:start position:0%
would allow someone to make a 91a
 
03:17:47.690 --> 03:17:47.700 align:start position:0%
request for ballots from an election
 
03:17:51.050 --> 03:17:51.060 align:start position:0%
10 years ago 15 years ago 20 years ago
 
03:17:55.670 --> 03:17:55.680 align:start position:0%
so there's yes there's no limit on 91a
 
03:17:58.670 --> 03:17:58.680 align:start position:0%
having said that 91a and the point of
 
03:18:00.769 --> 03:18:00.779 align:start position:0%
91a is that the government provides the
 
03:18:03.230 --> 03:18:03.240 align:start position:0%
records that it has to the extent we
 
03:18:04.849 --> 03:18:04.859 align:start position:0%
don't have those records the government
 
03:18:07.849 --> 03:18:07.859 align:start position:0%
is not beholden to provide them so I
 
03:18:09.769 --> 03:18:09.779 align:start position:0%
could make a 91a request for maybe the
 
03:18:11.929 --> 03:18:11.939 align:start position:0%
year of 1800 for what a particular town
 
03:18:14.929 --> 03:18:14.939 align:start position:0%
did in the year 1800 certainly that town
 
03:18:16.190 --> 03:18:16.200 align:start position:0%
probably doesn't have those records
 
03:18:18.290 --> 03:18:18.300 align:start position:0%
anymore and that's fine
 
03:18:20.510 --> 03:18:20.520 align:start position:0%
and we do dispose of ballots after a
 
03:18:23.570 --> 03:18:23.580 align:start position:0%
certain period in this state thank you
 
03:18:25.190 --> 03:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
moving forward though it would be
 
03:18:27.230 --> 03:18:27.240 align:start position:0%
consistent and then once we have the
 
03:18:29.450 --> 03:18:29.460 align:start position:0%
technology we would have those images in
 
03:18:29.460 --> 03:18:33.070 align:start position:0%
technology we would have those images in
perpetuity

03:18:33.070 --> 03:18:33.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:34.910 --> 03:18:34.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:18:34.920 --> 03:18:35.650 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

03:18:35.650 --> 03:18:35.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:18:38.510 --> 03:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
so to get to images at least when I read
 
03:18:40.610 --> 03:18:40.620 align:start position:0%
the bill it doesn't talk about images it
 
03:18:43.309 --> 03:18:43.319 align:start position:0%
talks about the actual balance although
 
03:18:45.889 --> 03:18:45.899 align:start position:0%
in the heading it talks about
 
03:18:48.830 --> 03:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
that I mean the analysis images of
 
03:18:51.710 --> 03:18:51.720 align:start position:0%
ballots so is this to get the actual
 
03:18:54.349 --> 03:18:54.359 align:start position:0%
balance or is this to get the images of
 
03:18:56.150 --> 03:18:56.160 align:start position:0%
the ballots I believe the inconsistency
 
03:18:58.070 --> 03:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
in wording here is because of the
 
03:19:00.769 --> 03:19:00.779 align:start position:0%
development of technology so up until
 
03:19:03.769 --> 03:19:03.779 align:start position:0%
recently having access to about the
 
03:19:05.870 --> 03:19:05.880 align:start position:0%
ballots would be simply access to see
 
03:19:08.990 --> 03:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
the ballots not to lay hold on of them
 
03:19:11.450 --> 03:19:11.460 align:start position:0%
obviously but to see them so the idea of
 
03:19:13.670 --> 03:19:13.680 align:start position:0%
the image now we have digital technology
 
03:19:15.530 --> 03:19:15.540 align:start position:0%
that can allow us to do that digitally
 
03:19:17.690 --> 03:19:17.700 align:start position:0%
and that's the same as if you were to do
 
03:19:20.630 --> 03:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
a 91a for your town whatever kind of
 
03:19:22.730 --> 03:19:22.740 align:start position:0%
meeting you had they would provide you
 
03:19:25.309 --> 03:19:25.319 align:start position:0%
in in today's world they would provide
 
03:19:26.929 --> 03:19:26.939 align:start position:0%
you a digital record of those things
 
03:19:28.910 --> 03:19:28.920 align:start position:0%
that you're requesting not the actual
 
03:19:32.349 --> 03:19:32.359 align:start position:0%
physical record okay so to clarify
 
03:19:35.530 --> 03:19:35.540 align:start position:0%
providing I'm sorry
 
03:19:39.410 --> 03:19:39.420 align:start position:0%
to clarify uh
 
03:19:41.990 --> 03:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
if a 918
 
03:19:45.410 --> 03:19:45.420 align:start position:0%
is requested providing the images of
 
03:19:47.570 --> 03:19:47.580 align:start position:0%
those ballots would be deemed sufficient
 
03:19:50.090 --> 03:19:50.100 align:start position:0%
that's how I understand all of 91a to
 
03:19:52.010 --> 03:19:52.020 align:start position:0%
work at this point if for whatever
 
03:19:53.750 --> 03:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
reason this committee decided that that
 
03:19:55.730 --> 03:19:55.740 align:start position:0%
was not clear enough for your liking in
 
03:19:57.950 --> 03:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
this particular bill I think it would be
 
03:19:59.809 --> 03:19:59.819 align:start position:0%
wise to amend it to make sure that we
 
03:20:01.849 --> 03:20:01.859 align:start position:0%
are kind of like a future proofing so
 
03:20:04.070 --> 03:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
we're clear that images count as a
 
03:20:07.070 --> 03:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
delivery of 91a thank you
 
03:20:10.070 --> 03:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
03:20:12.830 --> 03:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
representative Bay
 
03:20:14.929 --> 03:20:14.939 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
03:20:16.849 --> 03:20:16.859 align:start position:0%
question so
 
03:20:20.269 --> 03:20:20.279 align:start position:0%
um again uh with regard to the statement
 
03:20:22.250 --> 03:20:22.260 align:start position:0%
of to the extent that ballots or images
 
03:20:23.870 --> 03:20:23.880 align:start position:0%
are available they should be made
 
03:20:27.769 --> 03:20:27.779 align:start position:0%
available uh is there a current law on
 
03:20:31.190 --> 03:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
uh for how long
 
03:20:33.290 --> 03:20:33.300 align:start position:0%
um whoever's the responsible party is
 
03:20:35.990 --> 03:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
for how long they are supposed to keep
 
03:20:38.710 --> 03:20:38.720 align:start position:0%
those images or videos
 
03:20:42.410 --> 03:20:42.420 align:start position:0%
so I believe it this committee would
 
03:20:44.030 --> 03:20:44.040 align:start position:0%
know better than me I believe the town
 
03:20:46.429 --> 03:20:46.439 align:start position:0%
keeps it you say three okay I thought it
 
03:20:48.050 --> 03:20:48.060 align:start position:0%
was two for whatever reason but so the
 
03:20:51.290 --> 03:20:51.300 align:start position:0%
town keeps it for the physical ballots
 
03:20:54.590 --> 03:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
for three years we as far as I know and
 
03:20:55.670 --> 03:20:55.680 align:start position:0%
again this committee would have more
 
03:20:57.830 --> 03:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
expertise in this field than I do as far
 
03:21:00.590 --> 03:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
as I know we don't have language in
 
03:21:02.990 --> 03:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
terms of keeping the image of the ballot
 
03:21:04.730 --> 03:21:04.740 align:start position:0%
because we don't currently automatically
 
03:21:07.910 --> 03:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
make images of ballots so I would
 
03:21:10.969 --> 03:21:10.979 align:start position:0%
suggest that you all address that issue
 
03:21:12.530 --> 03:21:12.540 align:start position:0%
um because again it's a it's a matter of
 
03:21:15.230 --> 03:21:15.240 align:start position:0%
future proofing certainly whatever next
 
03:21:16.910 --> 03:21:16.920 align:start position:0%
generation of machines are coming our
 
03:21:19.550 --> 03:21:19.560 align:start position:0%
way will likely have the ability to make
 
03:21:21.349 --> 03:21:21.359 align:start position:0%
those automatic images of the ballots
 
03:21:23.990 --> 03:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
and that would be far more efficient and
 
03:21:26.929 --> 03:21:26.939 align:start position:0%
long-term than keeping a warehouse of
 
03:21:28.610 --> 03:21:28.620 align:start position:0%
physical ballots
 
03:21:31.070 --> 03:21:31.080 align:start position:0%
thank you you have no follow-up any
 
03:21:32.510 --> 03:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
03:21:34.250 --> 03:21:34.260 align:start position:0%
representative weary
 
03:21:36.710 --> 03:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
so just I think there's a federal
 
03:21:39.349 --> 03:21:39.359 align:start position:0%
requirement for 21 22 months something
 
03:21:41.809 --> 03:21:41.819 align:start position:0%
like that for a general election so I
 
03:21:41.819 --> 03:21:43.370 align:start position:0%
like that for a general election so I
think

03:21:43.370 --> 03:21:43.380 align:start position:0%
think
 
03:21:45.650 --> 03:21:45.660 align:start position:0%
uh maybe maybe there ought to be some
 
03:21:47.990 --> 03:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
Provisions about you know use as you
 
03:21:50.690 --> 03:21:50.700 align:start position:0%
said you indicated that
 
03:21:52.969 --> 03:21:52.979 align:start position:0%
91a applies to the records that are
 
03:21:55.429 --> 03:21:55.439 align:start position:0%
maintained and and maybe we need to make
 
03:21:58.010 --> 03:21:58.020 align:start position:0%
record-keeping Provisions accordingly
 
03:22:00.769 --> 03:22:00.779 align:start position:0%
for for ballot images
 
03:22:02.929 --> 03:22:02.939 align:start position:0%
uh so the question is do you think we
 
03:22:04.450 --> 03:22:04.460 align:start position:0%
should keep record keep you know
 
03:22:06.950 --> 03:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
Institute record-keeping requirements
 
03:22:09.590 --> 03:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
for valid images I I do so that's what I
 
03:22:11.570 --> 03:22:11.580 align:start position:0%
I was hoping to address in the previous
 
03:22:14.210 --> 03:22:14.220 align:start position:0%
question but obviously since our
 
03:22:16.849 --> 03:22:16.859 align:start position:0%
technology has developed it was in the
 
03:22:20.210 --> 03:22:20.220 align:start position:0%
past it was Impractical to tell towns or
 
03:22:22.429 --> 03:22:22.439 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State to keep all the
 
03:22:24.830 --> 03:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
ballots forever and ever and ever
 
03:22:26.630 --> 03:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
because eventually your Warehouse is
 
03:22:28.730 --> 03:22:28.740 align:start position:0%
just too big but
 
03:22:31.370 --> 03:22:31.380 align:start position:0%
um now that we have digital images it
 
03:22:33.410 --> 03:22:33.420 align:start position:0%
would be a very easy thing to do and
 
03:22:36.349 --> 03:22:36.359 align:start position:0%
easy to make available to the public so
 
03:22:38.929 --> 03:22:38.939 align:start position:0%
I would suggest again if you would like
 
03:22:41.210 --> 03:22:41.220 align:start position:0%
to amend this there are other things in
 
03:22:42.590 --> 03:22:42.600 align:start position:0%
terms of restricting certain ballots
 
03:22:46.010 --> 03:22:46.020 align:start position:0%
that are identifiable but also the idea
 
03:22:48.110 --> 03:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
of addressing the difference between yes
 
03:22:50.030 --> 03:22:50.040 align:start position:0%
the town and in the 22-month figure may
 
03:22:51.650 --> 03:22:51.660 align:start position:0%
be why I had it in my head that was two
 
03:22:56.030 --> 03:22:56.040 align:start position:0%
years but uh addressing yes the towns
 
03:22:57.730 --> 03:22:57.740 align:start position:0%
have to keep it for three years
 
03:23:01.610 --> 03:23:01.620 align:start position:0%
physically but the images the digital
 
03:23:04.969 --> 03:23:04.979 align:start position:0%
images shall be kept in perpetuity or
 
03:23:08.510 --> 03:23:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:10.250 --> 03:23:10.260 align:start position:0%
and it may be the the purview of the
 
03:23:12.050 --> 03:23:12.060 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State to keep that database
 
03:23:14.750 --> 03:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
rather than the towns
 
03:23:17.330 --> 03:23:17.340 align:start position:0%
representative wood per question
 
03:23:19.490 --> 03:23:19.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
03:23:21.650 --> 03:23:21.660 align:start position:0%
my question uh I don't know if this is
 
03:23:23.690 --> 03:23:23.700 align:start position:0%
appropriate but can you tell me why the
 
03:23:25.670 --> 03:23:25.680 align:start position:0%
bill didn't pass before
 
03:23:29.150 --> 03:23:29.160 align:start position:0%
as I so the Secretary of State
 
03:23:30.590 --> 03:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
um who I and this is the previous
 
03:23:32.630 --> 03:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State but I believe the
 
03:23:34.190 --> 03:23:34.200 align:start position:0%
current Secretary of State was acting in
 
03:23:35.690 --> 03:23:35.700 align:start position:0%
his stead in that committee room that
 
03:23:37.849 --> 03:23:37.859 align:start position:0%
day as I recall
 
03:23:39.769 --> 03:23:39.779 align:start position:0%
um and the argument was what about
 
03:23:41.990 --> 03:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
buying votes and that was the only
 
03:23:44.510 --> 03:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
argument that I remember
 
03:23:46.729 --> 03:23:46.739 align:start position:0%
um but we didn't seem to have a problem
 
03:23:48.889 --> 03:23:48.899 align:start position:0%
with buying votes beforehand and
 
03:23:50.630 --> 03:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
certainly today with cell phones you
 
03:23:51.950 --> 03:23:51.960 align:start position:0%
could easily buy a vote and more
 
03:23:54.050 --> 03:23:54.060 align:start position:0%
secretly buy a vote just by having a
 
03:23:56.150 --> 03:23:56.160 align:start position:0%
picture of that vote I'm certainly not
 
03:23:58.010 --> 03:23:58.020 align:start position:0%
advocating anyone buy or sell their
 
03:24:01.309 --> 03:24:01.319 align:start position:0%
votes but it this allowing it to be 91a
 
03:24:04.010 --> 03:24:04.020 align:start position:0%
addresses a huge transparency issue that
 
03:24:05.809 --> 03:24:05.819 align:start position:0%
we have and it doesn't increase any
 
03:24:07.670 --> 03:24:07.680 align:start position:0%
danger of the selling and buying of
 
03:24:09.670 --> 03:24:09.680 align:start position:0%
votes at all
 
03:24:12.410 --> 03:24:12.420 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up please
 
03:24:14.330 --> 03:24:14.340 align:start position:0%
um so the buying of votes was what came
 
03:24:16.969 --> 03:24:16.979 align:start position:0%
out because I I couldn't find follow
 
03:24:18.769 --> 03:24:18.779 align:start position:0%
your argument too well and you said it
 
03:24:21.650 --> 03:24:21.660 align:start position:0%
was confusing so I'm sorry no no I
 
03:24:24.290 --> 03:24:24.300 align:start position:0%
haven't I've never been to be confusing
 
03:24:27.650 --> 03:24:27.660 align:start position:0%
the so how can you just repeat that one
 
03:24:29.630 --> 03:24:29.640 align:start position:0%
more time to buy in a vote so since that
 
03:24:31.010 --> 03:24:31.020 align:start position:0%
was a critical piece because I don't get
 
03:24:32.870 --> 03:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
it thank you so in my previous
 
03:24:34.849 --> 03:24:34.859 align:start position:0%
iterations of the bill I made the
 
03:24:36.290 --> 03:24:36.300 align:start position:0%
arguments that I made before you today
 
03:24:38.570 --> 03:24:38.580 align:start position:0%
about transparency and doing things in
 
03:24:40.630 --> 03:24:40.640 align:start position:0%
the public and this being the the
 
03:24:43.910 --> 03:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
underlying like point of democracy or
 
03:24:46.130 --> 03:24:46.140 align:start position:0%
underlying basis of democracies that we
 
03:24:48.769 --> 03:24:48.779 align:start position:0%
all understand what's going on and the
 
03:24:50.809 --> 03:24:50.819 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State the deputy secretary
 
03:24:53.870 --> 03:24:53.880 align:start position:0%
of state then uh argued when against the
 
03:24:56.510 --> 03:24:56.520 align:start position:0%
bills saying he is concerned that if we
 
03:25:00.050 --> 03:25:00.060 align:start position:0%
return it to 91a this may assist people
 
03:25:01.849 --> 03:25:01.859 align:start position:0%
in the buying and selling of votes
 
03:25:04.429 --> 03:25:04.439 align:start position:0%
illegally the argument is that if those
 
03:25:06.590 --> 03:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
images of those ballots or the ballots
 
03:25:08.690 --> 03:25:08.700 align:start position:0%
themselves are available to the public
 
03:25:12.050 --> 03:25:12.060 align:start position:0%
then I as a bad actor having bought your
 
03:25:15.530 --> 03:25:15.540 align:start position:0%
vote can go make a 91a request check and
 
03:25:17.750 --> 03:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
see and you may have marked your ballot
 
03:25:21.050 --> 03:25:21.060 align:start position:0%
in identical diet identifiable way for
 
03:25:23.269 --> 03:25:23.279 align:start position:0%
example you told me ahead of time that
 
03:25:24.889 --> 03:25:24.899 align:start position:0%
you were going to write Donald duck in
 
03:25:26.630 --> 03:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
for a write-in for a particular race
 
03:25:29.690 --> 03:25:29.700 align:start position:0%
then I find that particular ballot I
 
03:25:30.889 --> 03:25:30.899 align:start position:0%
look and then you voted for the
 
03:25:33.410 --> 03:25:33.420 align:start position:0%
candidate I want and then I pay you my
 
03:25:35.750 --> 03:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
argument is a if you're buying someone's
 
03:25:37.070 --> 03:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
vote you probably shouldn't make a
 
03:25:38.450 --> 03:25:38.460 align:start position:0%
public record of the fact that you then
 
03:25:40.729 --> 03:25:40.739 align:start position:0%
went and checked to see and make sure
 
03:25:42.530 --> 03:25:42.540 align:start position:0%
that the vote you bought was was correct
 
03:25:44.990 --> 03:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
and then B there's a much more simple
 
03:25:46.670 --> 03:25:46.680 align:start position:0%
way of doing that which is simply the
 
03:25:49.190 --> 03:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
person whose vote you are buying takes a
 
03:25:51.290 --> 03:25:51.300 align:start position:0%
photograph of their ballot with their
 
03:25:54.229 --> 03:25:54.239 align:start position:0%
camera so I do not think that making
 
03:25:57.050 --> 03:25:57.060 align:start position:0%
this public record increases the
 
03:25:58.729 --> 03:25:58.739 align:start position:0%
likelihood of anyone buying or selling
 
03:26:00.710 --> 03:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
votes it may increase the likelihood of
 
03:26:04.309 --> 03:26:04.319 align:start position:0%
catching people who buy votes but but it
 
03:26:06.349 --> 03:26:06.359 align:start position:0%
does address a major transparency issue
 
03:26:09.170 --> 03:26:09.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:13.070 --> 03:26:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:14.990 --> 03:26:15.000 align:start position:0%
this is with regard to your comment
 
03:26:17.389 --> 03:26:17.399 align:start position:0%
about keeping the images in perpetuity
 
03:26:20.690 --> 03:26:20.700 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious do you believe that the
 
03:26:22.849 --> 03:26:22.859 align:start position:0%
cloud is infinite
 
03:26:22.859 --> 03:26:24.170 align:start position:0%
cloud is infinite
no

03:26:24.170 --> 03:26:24.180 align:start position:0%
no
 
03:26:28.490 --> 03:26:28.500 align:start position:0%
so every server exists somewhere and to
 
03:26:31.429 --> 03:26:31.439 align:start position:0%
the extent servers exist somewhere they
 
03:26:34.010 --> 03:26:34.020 align:start position:0%
are susceptible to being damaged broken
 
03:26:38.210 --> 03:26:38.220 align:start position:0%
what have you so there are flaws but
 
03:26:40.969 --> 03:26:40.979 align:start position:0%
that's why we have redundancy so you
 
03:26:42.530 --> 03:26:42.540 align:start position:0%
know if you ever have tried to remove
 
03:26:44.210 --> 03:26:44.220 align:start position:0%
like um
 
03:26:47.690 --> 03:26:47.700 align:start position:0%
a negative article or a image or a post
 
03:26:49.490 --> 03:26:49.500 align:start position:0%
or something from the internet
 
03:26:51.830 --> 03:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
it's hard to get rid of it it's hard to
 
03:26:53.570 --> 03:26:53.580 align:start position:0%
get take something completely off of the
 
03:26:55.309 --> 03:26:55.319 align:start position:0%
internet because there's so many copies
 
03:26:57.769 --> 03:26:57.779 align:start position:0%
that get made of that information so
 
03:27:00.410 --> 03:27:00.420 align:start position:0%
using that same premise
 
03:27:02.929 --> 03:27:02.939 align:start position:0%
um the cloud while Eddie one particular
 
03:27:05.090 --> 03:27:05.100 align:start position:0%
server is vulnerable when you have
 
03:27:07.190 --> 03:27:07.200 align:start position:0%
multiple copies you have so much
 
03:27:09.410 --> 03:27:09.420 align:start position:0%
redundancy that in effect you can keep
 
03:27:12.170 --> 03:27:12.180 align:start position:0%
things in perpetuity
 
03:27:15.229 --> 03:27:15.239 align:start position:0%
okay thank you I the only thank you
 
03:27:17.330 --> 03:27:17.340 align:start position:0%
representative thank you the only other
 
03:27:19.550 --> 03:27:19.560 align:start position:0%
card I have is for
 
03:27:29.570 --> 03:27:29.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:31.790 --> 03:27:31.800 align:start position:0%
just a minute
 
03:27:35.090 --> 03:27:35.100 align:start position:0%
I have one for you sir for 460 but not
 
03:27:44.110 --> 03:27:44.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:52.490 --> 03:27:52.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:52.500 --> 03:27:53.269 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:27:53.269 --> 03:27:53.279 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
03:27:55.190 --> 03:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
good afternoon members of the committee
 
03:27:57.830 --> 03:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
Dan Healy representing New Hampshire
 
03:28:01.250 --> 03:28:01.260 align:start position:0%
City and town clerks Association and we
 
03:28:03.910 --> 03:28:03.920 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill there's too many
 
03:28:07.130 --> 03:28:07.140 align:start position:0%
concerns that we have with this bill the
 
03:28:09.830 --> 03:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
way it's currently written at the end of
 
03:28:12.710 --> 03:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
the night on an election we have to seal
 
03:28:15.650 --> 03:28:15.660 align:start position:0%
the boxes with red security tape we have
 
03:28:19.670 --> 03:28:19.680 align:start position:0%
to have a town clerk and moderator and
 
03:28:22.070 --> 03:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
sign the seal along with Selectmen and
 
03:28:24.550 --> 03:28:24.560 align:start position:0%
we place that on the box
 
03:28:26.830 --> 03:28:26.840 align:start position:0%
the current law
 
03:28:29.630 --> 03:28:29.640 align:start position:0%
only a court order you can then go back
 
03:28:31.610 --> 03:28:31.620 align:start position:0%
and open that box so this doesn't
 
03:28:32.929 --> 03:28:32.939 align:start position:0%
address that
 
03:28:34.969 --> 03:28:34.979 align:start position:0%
so we have some concerns within
 
03:28:37.490 --> 03:28:37.500 align:start position:0%
retrieving the ballots and bringing them
 
03:28:40.790 --> 03:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
out for our 91a request in the larger
 
03:28:44.690 --> 03:28:44.700 align:start position:0%
communities I have probably 50 60 ballot
 
03:28:47.809 --> 03:28:47.819 align:start position:0%
boxes from the general election
 
03:28:47.819 --> 03:28:48.469 align:start position:0%
boxes from the general election
um

03:28:48.469 --> 03:28:48.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:28:50.690 --> 03:28:50.700 align:start position:0%
in a resident could come in there's no
 
03:28:52.490 --> 03:28:52.500 align:start position:0%
timeline on this a resident could come
 
03:28:55.250 --> 03:28:55.260 align:start position:0%
in or any any citizen can come in any
 
03:28:57.590 --> 03:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
time and request to see all these
 
03:28:59.990 --> 03:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
ballots there's no procedure for the
 
03:29:00.000 --> 03:29:01.550 align:start position:0%
ballots there's no procedure for the
viewing

03:29:01.550 --> 03:29:01.560 align:start position:0%
viewing
 
03:29:03.590 --> 03:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
um there's no guidelines on how to do
 
03:29:03.600 --> 03:29:05.690 align:start position:0%
um there's no guidelines on how to do
this

03:29:05.690 --> 03:29:05.700 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:29:08.330 --> 03:29:08.340 align:start position:0%
um for as far as transparency goes to
 
03:29:10.130 --> 03:29:10.140 align:start position:0%
and the communities that I've worked
 
03:29:12.410 --> 03:29:12.420 align:start position:0%
we've asked people that have concerns
 
03:29:14.330 --> 03:29:14.340 align:start position:0%
about elections to work the elections
 
03:29:16.070 --> 03:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
they can see the process they can see
 
03:29:18.889 --> 03:29:18.899 align:start position:0%
the ballots at recounts you're seeing
 
03:29:20.389 --> 03:29:20.399 align:start position:0%
the ballots you're seeing what was
 
03:29:20.399 --> 03:29:21.790 align:start position:0%
the ballots you're seeing what was
marked

03:29:21.790 --> 03:29:21.800 align:start position:0%
marked
 
03:29:24.530 --> 03:29:24.540 align:start position:0%
so just overall we just have a lot of
 
03:29:27.530 --> 03:29:27.540 align:start position:0%
concerns with this this bill and I'd be
 
03:29:29.630 --> 03:29:29.640 align:start position:0%
open to any questions
 
03:29:29.640 --> 03:29:32.269 align:start position:0%
open to any questions
representative

03:29:32.269 --> 03:29:32.279 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:29:35.330 --> 03:29:35.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you Mr Healy
 
03:29:35.340 --> 03:29:36.650 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you Mr Healy
um

03:29:36.650 --> 03:29:36.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:29:36.660 --> 03:29:38.269 align:start position:0%
um
for

03:29:38.269 --> 03:29:38.279 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:29:41.269 --> 03:29:41.279 align:start position:0%
ballot images you have the same
 
03:29:42.950 --> 03:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
objections that you have with the
 
03:29:45.889 --> 03:29:45.899 align:start position:0%
current ballot process so I agree that
 
03:29:50.929 --> 03:29:50.939 align:start position:0%
there are I think huge difficulties with
 
03:29:53.870 --> 03:29:53.880 align:start position:0%
uh the language here at perhaps
 
03:29:56.950 --> 03:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
instituting a a recount process
 
03:30:00.110 --> 03:30:00.120 align:start position:0%
inadvertently but if there were ballot
 
03:30:02.510 --> 03:30:02.520 align:start position:0%
images if the machine through capturing
 
03:30:05.570 --> 03:30:05.580 align:start position:0%
those images and then having those made
 
03:30:08.269 --> 03:30:08.279 align:start position:0%
available to the public
 
03:30:11.150 --> 03:30:11.160 align:start position:0%
with the clerk's Association have any
 
03:30:13.010 --> 03:30:13.020 align:start position:0%
objections with that we didn't
 
03:30:16.790 --> 03:30:16.800 align:start position:0%
specifically um discuss that I know the
 
03:30:20.210 --> 03:30:20.220 align:start position:0%
high image scanners are rather expensive
 
03:30:21.830 --> 03:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
I don't know if every Community would be
 
03:30:24.590 --> 03:30:24.600 align:start position:0%
able to afford those and then what's the
 
03:30:27.710 --> 03:30:27.720 align:start position:0%
process after the ballots are sealed to
 
03:30:30.410 --> 03:30:30.420 align:start position:0%
then run them through the scanner so
 
03:30:33.229 --> 03:30:33.239 align:start position:0%
there's not much that's really laid out
 
03:30:35.150 --> 03:30:35.160 align:start position:0%
for the procedure so even if we were to
 
03:30:38.090 --> 03:30:38.100 align:start position:0%
scan the images how would that how would
 
03:30:40.309 --> 03:30:40.319 align:start position:0%
we then do that so then after the
 
03:30:42.170 --> 03:30:42.180 align:start position:0%
election say a week or two later would
 
03:30:44.990 --> 03:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
we then be allowed to open the boxes up
 
03:30:48.050 --> 03:30:48.060 align:start position:0%
and run them through the scanner and
 
03:30:50.929 --> 03:30:50.939 align:start position:0%
then you know what about the towns that
 
03:30:52.729 --> 03:30:52.739 align:start position:0%
may not be able to afford I think it
 
03:30:55.309 --> 03:30:55.319 align:start position:0%
might be five thousand dollars for a
 
03:30:56.889 --> 03:30:56.899 align:start position:0%
scan a
 
03:31:00.349 --> 03:31:00.359 align:start position:0%
fast scanner I'm not quite sure on the
 
03:31:02.210 --> 03:31:02.220 align:start position:0%
cost on that but I know they're rather
 
03:31:02.220 --> 03:31:05.269 align:start position:0%
cost on that but I know they're rather
expensive

03:31:05.269 --> 03:31:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:07.610 --> 03:31:07.620 align:start position:0%
representative Brennan thank you and
 
03:31:10.070 --> 03:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my
 
03:31:12.110 --> 03:31:12.120 align:start position:0%
tweaking about the financial impact of
 
03:31:12.120 --> 03:31:14.170 align:start position:0%
tweaking about the financial impact of
municipalities

03:31:14.170 --> 03:31:14.180 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
03:31:17.090 --> 03:31:17.100 align:start position:0%
given that this bill does not outline a
 
03:31:18.530 --> 03:31:18.540 align:start position:0%
procedure and we're talking about
 
03:31:21.710 --> 03:31:21.720 align:start position:0%
digital scanning would you say there is
 
03:31:26.150 --> 03:31:26.160 align:start position:0%
in a heavy burden for municipalities and
 
03:31:29.510 --> 03:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
town employees If This Were to be
 
03:31:29.520 --> 03:31:31.670 align:start position:0%
town employees If This Were to be
implemented

03:31:31.670 --> 03:31:31.680 align:start position:0%
implemented
 
03:31:34.729 --> 03:31:34.739 align:start position:0%
uh yeah I would say so if if this bill
 
03:31:37.429 --> 03:31:37.439 align:start position:0%
passes the way it is and someone could
 
03:31:39.410 --> 03:31:39.420 align:start position:0%
come in and request to see all our
 
03:31:42.050 --> 03:31:42.060 align:start position:0%
ballots I believe in Nashua for the
 
03:31:45.050 --> 03:31:45.060 align:start position:0%
general election we had I want to say 33
 
03:31:48.170 --> 03:31:48.180 align:start position:0%
000 ballots cast
 
03:31:50.330 --> 03:31:50.340 align:start position:0%
um and there's you know they're in a
 
03:31:53.630 --> 03:31:53.640 align:start position:0%
secure location to then bring those uh
 
03:31:57.290 --> 03:31:57.300 align:start position:0%
to City Hall and to have them you know I
 
03:31:59.450 --> 03:31:59.460 align:start position:0%
don't know I don't know how you would do
 
03:32:02.950 --> 03:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
it really how I'd get 33 000 ballots
 
03:32:06.290 --> 03:32:06.300 align:start position:0%
there and uh be able to have someone
 
03:32:09.590 --> 03:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:11.570 --> 03:32:11.580 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
03:32:13.550 --> 03:32:13.560 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thanks
 
03:32:17.570 --> 03:32:17.580 align:start position:0%
okay representative popovichi Moa
 
03:32:20.990 --> 03:32:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:23.090 --> 03:32:23.100 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman you must
 
03:32:24.650 --> 03:32:24.660 align:start position:0%
have taken uh lessons from
 
03:32:27.590 --> 03:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
representative very earlier right
 
03:32:29.450 --> 03:32:29.460 align:start position:0%
um I I do want to apologize by the way
 
03:32:31.250 --> 03:32:31.260 align:start position:0%
for forgetting to turn in my pin card
 
03:32:34.670 --> 03:32:34.680 align:start position:0%
you are correct I submitted 144.60 I
 
03:32:36.530 --> 03:32:36.540 align:start position:0%
thought I submitted one for this but I
 
03:32:39.229 --> 03:32:39.239 align:start position:0%
recall I only turned it on so
 
03:32:42.170 --> 03:32:42.180 align:start position:0%
I want to be very quick but since I
 
03:32:45.530 --> 03:32:45.540 align:start position:0%
inadvertently ended up at the tail end
 
03:32:47.630 --> 03:32:47.640 align:start position:0%
of this I would rather instead of
 
03:32:49.130 --> 03:32:49.140 align:start position:0%
telling you what I was gonna tell you if
 
03:32:51.110 --> 03:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
I was allowed to speak first address a
 
03:32:52.729 --> 03:32:52.739 align:start position:0%
couple of the things that may be concern
 
03:32:54.349 --> 03:32:54.359 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
03:32:56.210 --> 03:32:56.220 align:start position:0%
the only thing that I'll say that I was
 
03:32:57.830 --> 03:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
going to say first is that this is
 
03:33:00.469 --> 03:33:00.479 align:start position:0%
purely transparency bill you know the
 
03:33:03.410 --> 03:33:03.420 align:start position:0%
intent is to to just help people gain
 
03:33:04.910 --> 03:33:04.920 align:start position:0%
confidence in the way the government
 
03:33:07.309 --> 03:33:07.319 align:start position:0%
works by requiring the government to be
 
03:33:10.010 --> 03:33:10.020 align:start position:0%
transparent and you all understand how
 
03:33:12.349 --> 03:33:12.359 align:start position:0%
critical elections are and Trust in the
 
03:33:14.090 --> 03:33:14.100 align:start position:0%
elections are and I don't need to you
 
03:33:16.670 --> 03:33:16.680 align:start position:0%
know sell you on that point
 
03:33:19.429 --> 03:33:19.439 align:start position:0%
just a couple of things first we had
 
03:33:21.650 --> 03:33:21.660 align:start position:0%
this in the past this is not a
 
03:33:24.349 --> 03:33:24.359 align:start position:0%
unforeseen situation ballots have been
 
03:33:27.110 --> 03:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
produced in response to 91a requests and
 
03:33:29.510 --> 03:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
nothing terrible happened if anything at
 
03:33:31.550 --> 03:33:31.560 align:start position:0%
least in one case
 
03:33:35.269 --> 03:33:35.279 align:start position:0%
that process resulted in an error that
 
03:33:36.710 --> 03:33:36.720 align:start position:0%
would have changed the results being
 
03:33:39.710 --> 03:33:39.720 align:start position:0%
caught and found in time but the intent
 
03:33:42.050 --> 03:33:42.060 align:start position:0%
of this bill is not to do that
 
03:33:44.330 --> 03:33:44.340 align:start position:0%
I think that the healthy way to look at
 
03:33:45.830 --> 03:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
the election process is to understand
 
03:33:48.349 --> 03:33:48.359 align:start position:0%
that whatever results are certified by
 
03:33:50.809 --> 03:33:50.819 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State are final that it
 
03:33:53.210 --> 03:33:53.220 align:start position:0%
is the best effort the intent of this is
 
03:33:55.490 --> 03:33:55.500 align:start position:0%
to not reopen that Pandora's Box is just
 
03:33:57.950 --> 03:33:57.960 align:start position:0%
to allow people after the fact
 
03:34:00.650 --> 03:34:00.660 align:start position:0%
to take a look at uh you know how the
 
03:34:02.690 --> 03:34:02.700 align:start position:0%
sausage was made for the lack of a
 
03:34:03.950 --> 03:34:03.960 align:start position:0%
better term
 
03:34:06.710 --> 03:34:06.720 align:start position:0%
and yes not every restaurant is happy
 
03:34:09.410 --> 03:34:09.420 align:start position:0%
with people looking in their kitchen but
 
03:34:11.030 --> 03:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
good restaurants are
 
03:34:13.610 --> 03:34:13.620 align:start position:0%
I know that there is concern that people
 
03:34:14.809 --> 03:34:14.819 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:34:16.550 --> 03:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
are worried about
 
03:34:18.950 --> 03:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
people taking too close of a look but I
 
03:34:20.929 --> 03:34:20.939 align:start position:0%
would urge you to consider the
 
03:34:23.809 --> 03:34:23.819 align:start position:0%
importance of trust and the ability of
 
03:34:25.910 --> 03:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
people to check the work
 
03:34:27.469 --> 03:34:27.479 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:34:30.590 --> 03:34:30.600 align:start position:0%
in regards to the procedure that is
 
03:34:30.600 --> 03:34:31.490 align:start position:0%
in regards to the procedure that is
needed

03:34:31.490 --> 03:34:31.500 align:start position:0%
needed
 
03:34:33.769 --> 03:34:33.779 align:start position:0%
representative read was kind enough to
 
03:34:35.330 --> 03:34:35.340 align:start position:0%
remind me that her previous build
 
03:34:37.729 --> 03:34:37.739 align:start position:0%
language had procedures
 
03:34:39.889 --> 03:34:39.899 align:start position:0%
and frankly it has been my experience
 
03:34:42.290 --> 03:34:42.300 align:start position:0%
that you know if one tries to keep a
 
03:34:44.510 --> 03:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
bill simple like this one is this one
 
03:34:46.610 --> 03:34:46.620 align:start position:0%
literally removes a paragraph and adds a
 
03:34:48.889 --> 03:34:48.899 align:start position:0%
line people are gonna say oh my God you
 
03:34:50.690 --> 03:34:50.700 align:start position:0%
don't have procedure well I just had
 
03:34:52.250 --> 03:34:52.260 align:start position:0%
another bill which had a lot of
 
03:34:54.229 --> 03:34:54.239 align:start position:0%
procedure eviscerated because the
 
03:34:56.030 --> 03:34:56.040 align:start position:0%
procedure was present and I shouldn't
 
03:34:59.090 --> 03:34:59.100 align:start position:0%
tell the Departments how to do their job
 
03:35:01.190 --> 03:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
if the Departments would like to have
 
03:35:03.170 --> 03:35:03.180 align:start position:0%
procedure I'm sure the legislature is
 
03:35:05.389 --> 03:35:05.399 align:start position:0%
happy to provide it and this you know
 
03:35:06.889 --> 03:35:06.899 align:start position:0%
committee has all the knowledge they
 
03:35:08.570 --> 03:35:08.580 align:start position:0%
need and again they have previous bills
 
03:35:10.490 --> 03:35:10.500 align:start position:0%
where they can address that if that's
 
03:35:12.769 --> 03:35:12.779 align:start position:0%
what holding this bill back my
 
03:35:14.630 --> 03:35:14.640 align:start position:0%
philosophy on this bill is that I
 
03:35:16.309 --> 03:35:16.319 align:start position:0%
absolutely trust the people who are
 
03:35:19.490 --> 03:35:19.500 align:start position:0%
already handling 91a requests to handle
 
03:35:21.229 --> 03:35:21.239 align:start position:0%
requests for ballots in the same way
 
03:35:23.990 --> 03:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
they handle any other 91a request we
 
03:35:25.969 --> 03:35:25.979 align:start position:0%
don't give people the original contract
 
03:35:28.670 --> 03:35:28.680 align:start position:0%
we give them a copy of it and by the way
 
03:35:30.769 --> 03:35:30.779 align:start position:0%
in regards to cost we have the ability
 
03:35:32.630 --> 03:35:32.640 align:start position:0%
to charge them a reasonable cost per
 
03:35:34.910 --> 03:35:34.920 align:start position:0%
copy because there is a cost in you know
 
03:35:37.429 --> 03:35:37.439 align:start position:0%
the materials and everything so
 
03:35:39.889 --> 03:35:39.899 align:start position:0%
you know if you are a small town you
 
03:35:41.990 --> 03:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
don't need to buy a high speed scanner
 
03:35:44.510 --> 03:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
you can share one with 15 other towns
 
03:35:46.190 --> 03:35:46.200 align:start position:0%
and use it when it's needed and I'm sure
 
03:35:48.110 --> 03:35:48.120 align:start position:0%
there will be an enterprising soul that
 
03:35:51.590 --> 03:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
will buy a truck and buy a scanner and
 
03:35:53.690 --> 03:35:53.700 align:start position:0%
go around helping towns that don't have
 
03:35:56.030 --> 03:35:56.040 align:start position:0%
their own scanners
 
03:35:59.510 --> 03:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
I believe that we have a duty
 
03:36:02.389 --> 03:36:02.399 align:start position:0%
to be open to our people I think that
 
03:36:04.490 --> 03:36:04.500 align:start position:0%
this bill is very simple and very
 
03:36:04.500 --> 03:36:06.110 align:start position:0%
this bill is very simple and very
straightforward

03:36:06.110 --> 03:36:06.120 align:start position:0%
straightforward
 
03:36:08.030 --> 03:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:36:10.670 --> 03:36:10.680 align:start position:0%
I believe that it is a bill that the
 
03:36:12.530 --> 03:36:12.540 align:start position:0%
committee should support actually out of
 
03:36:14.330 --> 03:36:14.340 align:start position:0%
all the bills that I'm presenting and
 
03:36:16.729 --> 03:36:16.739 align:start position:0%
God knows I'm coming here for 460 and
 
03:36:18.830 --> 03:36:18.840 align:start position:0%
I'm excluding that one from this
 
03:36:18.840 --> 03:36:19.910 align:start position:0%
I'm excluding that one from this
statement

03:36:19.910 --> 03:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
statement
 
03:36:22.370 --> 03:36:22.380 align:start position:0%
I think this is the one that honestly
 
03:36:25.070 --> 03:36:25.080 align:start position:0%
should be the most bipartisan everybody
 
03:36:27.349 --> 03:36:27.359 align:start position:0%
in this room I would hope understand the
 
03:36:29.150 --> 03:36:29.160 align:start position:0%
importance of the transparencies this is
 
03:36:32.030 --> 03:36:32.040 align:start position:0%
not a Republican or a Democrat point of
 
03:36:34.370 --> 03:36:34.380 align:start position:0%
view it's simply a we are accountable to
 
03:36:36.290 --> 03:36:36.300 align:start position:0%
the people that we serve and that
 
03:36:38.929 --> 03:36:38.939 align:start position:0%
includes showing them you know the
 
03:36:40.729 --> 03:36:40.739 align:start position:0%
public records that are generated I
 
03:36:42.290 --> 03:36:42.300 align:start position:0%
really appreciate your patience thank
 
03:36:45.170 --> 03:36:45.180 align:start position:0%
you thank you any questions
 
03:36:48.710 --> 03:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
with that thank you and
 
03:36:51.469 --> 03:36:51.479 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you and now call on
 
03:37:01.670 --> 03:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:03.710 --> 03:37:03.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair good afternoon
 
03:37:05.870 --> 03:37:05.880 align:start position:0%
everyone Aaron Hennessey deputy
 
03:37:08.809 --> 03:37:08.819 align:start position:0%
secretary of state we are opposed to
 
03:37:11.389 --> 03:37:11.399 align:start position:0%
this bill as written
 
03:37:11.399 --> 03:37:12.410 align:start position:0%
this bill as written
um

03:37:12.410 --> 03:37:12.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:14.510 --> 03:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
a little information
 
03:37:16.130 --> 03:37:16.140 align:start position:0%
um just quickly
 
03:37:18.769 --> 03:37:18.779 align:start position:0%
um the read the sorry I can't see all of
 
03:37:18.779 --> 03:37:19.610 align:start position:0%
um the read the sorry I can't see all of
you

03:37:19.610 --> 03:37:19.620 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:37:22.550 --> 03:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
um so for federal elections ballots have
 
03:37:23.510 --> 03:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
to be
 
03:37:25.550 --> 03:37:25.560 align:start position:0%
um election materials have to be kept
 
03:37:28.490 --> 03:37:28.500 align:start position:0%
for 22 months and for local elections
 
03:37:31.790 --> 03:37:31.800 align:start position:0%
it's 60 days but that that's if there's
 
03:37:34.790 --> 03:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
no pending litigation going on so just
 
03:37:36.349 --> 03:37:36.359 align:start position:0%
uh I know there was a lot of talk about
 
03:37:38.750 --> 03:37:38.760 align:start position:0%
what the timelines are
 
03:37:38.760 --> 03:37:40.190 align:start position:0%
what the timelines are
um

03:37:40.190 --> 03:37:40.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:42.290 --> 03:37:42.300 align:start position:0%
so as I said we are opposed to this
 
03:37:44.990 --> 03:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
legislation uh currently if you want to
 
03:37:45.000 --> 03:37:46.190 align:start position:0%
legislation uh currently if you want to
open

03:37:46.190 --> 03:37:46.200 align:start position:0%
open
 
03:37:48.050 --> 03:37:48.060 align:start position:0%
um election materials and I say election
 
03:37:49.849 --> 03:37:49.859 align:start position:0%
materials because this just does not
 
03:37:52.790 --> 03:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
relate to the nice flat ballots it
 
03:37:54.889 --> 03:37:54.899 align:start position:0%
relates to the wrinkled up outer
 
03:37:58.309 --> 03:37:58.319 align:start position:0%
envelopes the affidavit envelopes the
 
03:37:58.319 --> 03:37:59.090 align:start position:0%
envelopes the affidavit envelopes the
um

03:37:59.090 --> 03:37:59.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:38:03.050 --> 03:38:03.060 align:start position:0%
the absentee ballot applications and all
 
03:38:05.809 --> 03:38:05.819 align:start position:0%
of the other materials and and the
 
03:38:09.170 --> 03:38:09.180 align:start position:0%
folded ballots the anything that you if
 
03:38:10.670 --> 03:38:10.680 align:start position:0%
you've been to a recount that you've
 
03:38:12.170 --> 03:38:12.180 align:start position:0%
seen that we go through at a recount
 
03:38:13.910 --> 03:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
that's all of the election materials
 
03:38:16.490 --> 03:38:16.500 align:start position:0%
that this relates to so
 
03:38:16.500 --> 03:38:17.450 align:start position:0%
that this relates to so
um

03:38:17.450 --> 03:38:17.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:38:17.460 --> 03:38:18.229 align:start position:0%
um
um

03:38:18.229 --> 03:38:18.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:38:20.809 --> 03:38:20.819 align:start position:0%
currently as some of the other speakers
 
03:38:24.229 --> 03:38:24.239 align:start position:0%
noted the these boxes can only be opened
 
03:38:28.610 --> 03:38:28.620 align:start position:0%
at a recount by a court order or if if
 
03:38:31.370 --> 03:38:31.380 align:start position:0%
um accidentally someone election night
 
03:38:34.490 --> 03:38:34.500 align:start position:0%
put their return of votes form sealed it
 
03:38:36.530 --> 03:38:36.540 align:start position:0%
up into a box which occasionally does
 
03:38:39.110 --> 03:38:39.120 align:start position:0%
happen then there is a process where the
 
03:38:41.990 --> 03:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
state has to come and that box is open
 
03:38:44.750 --> 03:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
in front of the state this legislation
 
03:38:47.510 --> 03:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't account for any of that so our
 
03:38:49.790 --> 03:38:49.800 align:start position:0%
reading of it is that if
 
03:38:53.450 --> 03:38:53.460 align:start position:0%
um someone locally requests for a state
 
03:38:56.389 --> 03:38:56.399 align:start position:0%
election material box to be opened and
 
03:38:58.070 --> 03:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
to access those materials that we would
 
03:39:00.830 --> 03:39:00.840 align:start position:0%
have to go around to every locality and
 
03:39:03.889 --> 03:39:03.899 align:start position:0%
observe that opening of the materials so
 
03:39:05.929 --> 03:39:05.939 align:start position:0%
if you were to pass that just take that
 
03:39:08.349 --> 03:39:08.359 align:start position:0%
into consideration
 
03:39:10.910 --> 03:39:10.920 align:start position:0%
one other thing to consider is that
 
03:39:13.490 --> 03:39:13.500 align:start position:0%
approximately half of our towns in New
 
03:39:15.110 --> 03:39:15.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire do not have ballot counting
 
03:39:17.870 --> 03:39:17.880 align:start position:0%
devices the wording the language in this
 
03:39:19.550 --> 03:39:19.560 align:start position:0%
bill also I'm not considering any
 
03:39:21.469 --> 03:39:21.479 align:start position:0%
proposed amendments that were spoken of
 
03:39:24.769 --> 03:39:24.779 align:start position:0%
does not talk about scanned images it if
 
03:39:26.450 --> 03:39:26.460 align:start position:0%
the reading of it is that ballot
 
03:39:29.030 --> 03:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
election materials so it's full access
 
03:39:31.550 --> 03:39:31.560 align:start position:0%
to all of the pieces of paper
 
03:39:35.210 --> 03:39:35.220 align:start position:0%
so a lot of towns in New Hampshire if a
 
03:39:36.950 --> 03:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
ballot if the ballot law commission does
 
03:39:39.410 --> 03:39:39.420 align:start position:0%
approve a new accounting device which I
 
03:39:41.870 --> 03:39:41.880 align:start position:0%
anticipate they do those new devices can
 
03:39:44.090 --> 03:39:44.100 align:start position:0%
scan and store those images
 
03:39:45.650 --> 03:39:45.660 align:start position:0%
but half the towns in New Hampshire
 
03:39:47.690 --> 03:39:47.700 align:start position:0%
currently don't have a ballot counting
 
03:39:49.250 --> 03:39:49.260 align:start position:0%
device and they probably won't have the
 
03:39:51.110 --> 03:39:51.120 align:start position:0%
new one either so they won't have those
 
03:39:53.330 --> 03:39:53.340 align:start position:0%
images scanned and again the pallet
 
03:39:56.090 --> 03:39:56.100 align:start position:0%
counting devices that will be approved
 
03:39:57.469 --> 03:39:57.479 align:start position:0%
in the future are not going to be
 
03:40:00.469 --> 03:40:00.479 align:start position:0%
scanning envelopes affidavits and other
 
03:40:02.210 --> 03:40:02.220 align:start position:0%
election materials so there's there's
 
03:40:03.889 --> 03:40:03.899 align:start position:0%
not going to be all of that information
 
03:40:06.830 --> 03:40:06.840 align:start position:0%
in the cloud someplace
 
03:40:06.840 --> 03:40:08.090 align:start position:0%
in the cloud someplace
um

03:40:08.090 --> 03:40:08.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:40:08.100 --> 03:40:09.469 align:start position:0%
um
the

03:40:09.469 --> 03:40:09.479 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:40:09.479 --> 03:40:10.370 align:start position:0%
the
um

03:40:10.370 --> 03:40:10.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:40:12.590 --> 03:40:12.600 align:start position:0%
the individual's right to a private
 
03:40:12.600 --> 03:40:14.090 align:start position:0%
the individual's right to a private
ballot

03:40:14.090 --> 03:40:14.100 align:start position:0%
ballot
 
03:40:16.429 --> 03:40:16.439 align:start position:0%
um we we take that
 
03:40:18.590 --> 03:40:18.600 align:start position:0%
um if you when you walk into a polling
 
03:40:20.450 --> 03:40:20.460 align:start position:0%
location and you go and you see you can
 
03:40:22.370 --> 03:40:22.380 align:start position:0%
walk into a ballot Booth or use one of
 
03:40:23.990 --> 03:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
the screens there's a reason why we have
 
03:40:26.030 --> 03:40:26.040 align:start position:0%
that because in New Hampshire we want to
 
03:40:27.710 --> 03:40:27.720 align:start position:0%
protect your right to or your private
 
03:40:27.720 --> 03:40:29.269 align:start position:0%
protect your right to or your private
ballot

03:40:29.269 --> 03:40:29.279 align:start position:0%
ballot
 
03:40:32.450 --> 03:40:32.460 align:start position:0%
um and in in the cases where
 
03:40:34.490 --> 03:40:34.500 align:start position:0%
um images are maybe scanned or just
 
03:40:37.010 --> 03:40:37.020 align:start position:0%
shared in general somebody has access to
 
03:40:40.490 --> 03:40:40.500 align:start position:0%
the papers we feel that that imp that
 
03:40:42.830 --> 03:40:42.840 align:start position:0%
privacy may be violated especially if
 
03:40:44.889 --> 03:40:44.899 align:start position:0%
there's somebody
 
03:40:48.889 --> 03:40:48.899 align:start position:0%
has a disability and uses the um the
 
03:40:50.750 --> 03:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
machine to help them vote those ballots
 
03:40:52.070 --> 03:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
look a little different if somebody's
 
03:40:55.070 --> 03:40:55.080 align:start position:0%
used to yokava ballot and in some
 
03:40:56.630 --> 03:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
instances some people actually sign
 
03:40:58.670 --> 03:40:58.680 align:start position:0%
their name to their ballot so those
 
03:41:01.429 --> 03:41:01.439 align:start position:0%
individuals would lose that right to a
 
03:41:03.110 --> 03:41:03.120 align:start position:0%
private ballot
 
03:41:03.120 --> 03:41:04.250 align:start position:0%
private ballot
um

03:41:04.250 --> 03:41:04.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:41:07.010 --> 03:41:07.020 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of talk about
 
03:41:09.410 --> 03:41:09.420 align:start position:0%
um the um
 
03:41:13.490 --> 03:41:13.500 align:start position:0%
the why this 91a was removed initially
 
03:41:16.250 --> 03:41:16.260 align:start position:0%
and that has to do with um possible
 
03:41:19.370 --> 03:41:19.380 align:start position:0%
possible buying of ballots we do still
 
03:41:21.229 --> 03:41:21.239 align:start position:0%
have that concern
 
03:41:22.790 --> 03:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
um there are very
 
03:41:25.070 --> 03:41:25.080 align:start position:0%
um schemey people out there you know you
 
03:41:26.210 --> 03:41:26.220 align:start position:0%
read about
 
03:41:28.429 --> 03:41:28.439 align:start position:0%
um abuses happening all the time Elder
 
03:41:32.030 --> 03:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
abuses Financial related but there's
 
03:41:33.710 --> 03:41:33.720 align:start position:0%
um very talented folks out there who
 
03:41:35.150 --> 03:41:35.160 align:start position:0%
could come up with some sort of scheme
 
03:41:38.690 --> 03:41:38.700 align:start position:0%
to buy ballots and buy your vote
 
03:41:42.050 --> 03:41:42.060 align:start position:0%
um say if if I know if I want you to
 
03:41:43.849 --> 03:41:43.859 align:start position:0%
vote for this person you're going to
 
03:41:45.349 --> 03:41:45.359 align:start position:0%
have to put on the county commissioner
 
03:41:48.469 --> 03:41:48.479 align:start position:0%
line Aaron Hennessey and there'd be some
 
03:41:49.790 --> 03:41:49.800 align:start position:0%
sort of scheme where they'd be able to
 
03:41:51.349 --> 03:41:51.359 align:start position:0%
do that and then check and make sure
 
03:41:52.790 --> 03:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
you've done that
 
03:41:54.469 --> 03:41:54.479 align:start position:0%
um this used to happen
 
03:41:57.469 --> 03:41:57.479 align:start position:0%
um and that's why in the 1800s
 
03:41:59.929 --> 03:41:59.939 align:start position:0%
um the United States got away from that
 
03:42:02.690 --> 03:42:02.700 align:start position:0%
option and moved to secret ballots so
 
03:42:02.700 --> 03:42:03.769 align:start position:0%
option and moved to secret ballots so
that

03:42:03.769 --> 03:42:03.779 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:42:06.830 --> 03:42:06.840 align:start position:0%
um people weren't or at least instances
 
03:42:10.010 --> 03:42:10.020 align:start position:0%
of that were reduced so that's one of
 
03:42:12.769 --> 03:42:12.779 align:start position:0%
our concern another concern is that
 
03:42:14.870 --> 03:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
there is no FN on this note and I know
 
03:42:16.729 --> 03:42:16.739 align:start position:0%
since I used to be on the finance
 
03:42:17.990 --> 03:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
committee in both the house and the
 
03:42:20.269 --> 03:42:20.279 align:start position:0%
Senate that um you're not supposed to
 
03:42:21.830 --> 03:42:21.840 align:start position:0%
look at the fiscal impact because you're
 
03:42:23.210 --> 03:42:23.220 align:start position:0%
a policy committee but I just want to
 
03:42:25.309 --> 03:42:25.319 align:start position:0%
say that this bill did not come to our
 
03:42:27.290 --> 03:42:27.300 align:start position:0%
office for a fiscal note and if it did
 
03:42:29.090 --> 03:42:29.100 align:start position:0%
it would be
 
03:42:30.950 --> 03:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
um it would be very it would be a high
 
03:42:33.469 --> 03:42:33.479 align:start position:0%
dollar amount and I can imagine that if
 
03:42:35.389 --> 03:42:35.399 align:start position:0%
it went to the municipal Association I
 
03:42:36.769 --> 03:42:36.779 align:start position:0%
don't think they've testified on this
 
03:42:40.190 --> 03:42:40.200 align:start position:0%
that they would also have a very a big
 
03:42:42.889 --> 03:42:42.899 align:start position:0%
fiscal concern whether it be to buying a
 
03:42:45.650 --> 03:42:45.660 align:start position:0%
scanner or a person's time and the the
 
03:42:47.990 --> 03:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
biggest thing is the time so right now
 
03:42:51.110 --> 03:42:51.120 align:start position:0%
ballots are are not accessible because
 
03:42:53.809 --> 03:42:53.819 align:start position:0%
of 91a but ballot boxes are
 
03:42:56.630 --> 03:42:56.640 align:start position:0%
and people do come to our office and ask
 
03:42:59.870 --> 03:42:59.880 align:start position:0%
to see our logs to measure the boxes to
 
03:43:02.450 --> 03:43:02.460 align:start position:0%
count the boxes to look at the seals and
 
03:43:04.969 --> 03:43:04.979 align:start position:0%
that's a very time consuming process and
 
03:43:07.670 --> 03:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
we are in favor of that process because
 
03:43:09.530 --> 03:43:09.540 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that
 
03:43:12.590 --> 03:43:12.600 align:start position:0%
um we're very transparent and open about
 
03:43:14.990 --> 03:43:15.000 align:start position:0%
our elections and we follow the laws as
 
03:43:16.429 --> 03:43:16.439 align:start position:0%
they're written but I do want to say
 
03:43:18.229 --> 03:43:18.239 align:start position:0%
that there would be a huge fiscal impact
 
03:43:20.990 --> 03:43:21.000 align:start position:0%
for people being able to come in and
 
03:43:23.469 --> 03:43:23.479 align:start position:0%
look at each of the ballot or affidavit
 
03:43:23.479 --> 03:43:25.269 align:start position:0%
look at each of the ballot or affidavit
envelope

03:43:25.269 --> 03:43:25.279 align:start position:0%
envelope
 
03:43:27.950 --> 03:43:27.960 align:start position:0%
in addition we want to make sure that
 
03:43:30.429 --> 03:43:30.439 align:start position:0%
this these are the official election
 
03:43:33.170 --> 03:43:33.180 align:start position:0%
materials and if somebody has access to
 
03:43:34.849 --> 03:43:34.859 align:start position:0%
the physical election materials and can
 
03:43:36.349 --> 03:43:36.359 align:start position:0%
touch them
 
03:43:38.269 --> 03:43:38.279 align:start position:0%
um there there could be things that
 
03:43:40.250 --> 03:43:40.260 align:start position:0%
happen to those materials so
 
03:43:42.469 --> 03:43:42.479 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take questions
 
03:43:44.450 --> 03:43:44.460 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
03:43:48.889 --> 03:43:48.899 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chairman
 
03:43:52.309 --> 03:43:52.319 align:start position:0%
it was talked about in a another
 
03:43:55.550 --> 03:43:55.560 align:start position:0%
person's testimony that this is done in
 
03:43:57.889 --> 03:43:57.899 align:start position:0%
Vermont are you aware of it being done
 
03:44:01.550 --> 03:44:01.560 align:start position:0%
in any other state I ask because Vermont
 
03:44:04.250 --> 03:44:04.260 align:start position:0%
uses the same electronic ballot counting
 
03:44:06.229 --> 03:44:06.239 align:start position:0%
machines that we do which at this point
 
03:44:08.389 --> 03:44:08.399 align:start position:0%
doesn't have that capability so are they
 
03:44:08.399 --> 03:44:09.290 align:start position:0%
doesn't have that capability so are they
using

03:44:09.290 --> 03:44:09.300 align:start position:0%
using
 
03:44:12.290 --> 03:44:12.300 align:start position:0%
additional equipment what do you know I
 
03:44:13.790 --> 03:44:13.800 align:start position:0%
actually don't know what they do but I'm
 
03:44:16.790 --> 03:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
happy to find out for you thank you
 
03:44:20.090 --> 03:44:20.100 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative thank
 
03:44:22.250 --> 03:44:22.260 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
03:44:25.190 --> 03:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
question would you also consider the
 
03:44:27.950 --> 03:44:27.960 align:start position:0%
storage of ballot images to have fiscal
 
03:44:27.960 --> 03:44:30.110 align:start position:0%
storage of ballot images to have fiscal
impact

03:44:30.110 --> 03:44:30.120 align:start position:0%
impact
 
03:44:30.120 --> 03:44:31.309 align:start position:0%
impact
yes

03:44:31.309 --> 03:44:31.319 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:44:33.229 --> 03:44:33.239 align:start position:0%
they will they will have a fiscal impact
 
03:44:33.239 --> 03:44:34.429 align:start position:0%
they will they will have a fiscal impact
they're

03:44:34.429 --> 03:44:34.439 align:start position:0%
they're
 
03:44:36.590 --> 03:44:36.600 align:start position:0%
um sorry thank you for the question
 
03:44:37.849 --> 03:44:37.859 align:start position:0%
um we would have to come up with a
 
03:44:39.710 --> 03:44:39.720 align:start position:0%
process to store them
 
03:44:42.950 --> 03:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
um at the state level to make
 
03:44:44.990 --> 03:44:45.000 align:start position:0%
to scan them and store everything and
 
03:44:46.670 --> 03:44:46.680 align:start position:0%
again it's election materials it's not
 
03:44:48.530 --> 03:44:48.540 align:start position:0%
just the ballots I mean at the local
 
03:44:50.929 --> 03:44:50.939 align:start position:0%
level there would be a fiscal impact to
 
03:44:53.210 --> 03:44:53.220 align:start position:0%
them as well especially
 
03:44:56.090 --> 03:44:56.100 align:start position:0%
um for for local elections
 
03:44:58.550 --> 03:44:58.560 align:start position:0%
follow up follow-up
 
03:45:02.389 --> 03:45:02.399 align:start position:0%
um so uh you said that currently there's
 
03:45:04.849 --> 03:45:04.859 align:start position:0%
a requirement to um store the ballots
 
03:45:06.830 --> 03:45:06.840 align:start position:0%
for 22 months or something like that
 
03:45:10.070 --> 03:45:10.080 align:start position:0%
what would be your recommendation uh if
 
03:45:14.410 --> 03:45:14.420 align:start position:0%
you would have one uh for how long the
 
03:45:18.950 --> 03:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:20.809 --> 03:45:20.819 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that the ballot
 
03:45:23.750 --> 03:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
images if we were to move to a different
 
03:45:25.610 --> 03:45:25.620 align:start position:0%
ballot counting device which again I'm
 
03:45:28.250 --> 03:45:28.260 align:start position:0%
sure that we will be that those would be
 
03:45:31.190 --> 03:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
stored for 22 months as well
 
03:45:32.570 --> 03:45:32.580 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:45:35.450 --> 03:45:35.460 align:start position:0%
representative Bruno
 
03:45:38.990 --> 03:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair uh thank you for
 
03:45:40.910 --> 03:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
this question I just first wanted to
 
03:45:43.969 --> 03:45:43.979 align:start position:0%
confirm the new devices can scan and
 
03:45:46.130 --> 03:45:46.140 align:start position:0%
take images of ballots is that correct
 
03:45:49.990 --> 03:45:50.000 align:start position:0%
that's correct and um follow up please
 
03:45:53.389 --> 03:45:53.399 align:start position:0%
uh who's going to be paying for these
 
03:45:55.910 --> 03:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
new devices the state or the town and
 
03:45:55.920 --> 03:45:57.969 align:start position:0%
new devices the state or the town and
cities

03:45:57.969 --> 03:45:57.979 align:start position:0%
cities
 
03:46:01.309 --> 03:46:01.319 align:start position:0%
generally the towns and cities elect
 
03:46:03.889 --> 03:46:03.899 align:start position:0%
locally to use a ballot counting device
 
03:46:06.650 --> 03:46:06.660 align:start position:0%
and they pay for that themselves along
 
03:46:07.849 --> 03:46:07.859 align:start position:0%
with the
 
03:46:11.690 --> 03:46:11.700 align:start position:0%
um Annual fees okay thank you
 
03:46:13.969 --> 03:46:13.979 align:start position:0%
thank you and in terms of time I think
 
03:46:16.910 --> 03:46:16.920 align:start position:0%
we end in questions and this closes the
 
03:46:19.670 --> 03:46:19.680 align:start position:0%

New Boston
 
03:48:19.859 --> 03:48:21.469 align:start position:0%
New Boston
so

03:48:21.469 --> 03:48:21.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:48:24.469 --> 03:48:24.479 align:start position:0%
house pool 484 was
 
03:48:27.290 --> 03:48:27.300 align:start position:0%
um uh constituent bill from My Town
 
03:48:32.210 --> 03:48:32.220 align:start position:0%
Clerk and during covid we experienced
 
03:48:35.269 --> 03:48:35.279 align:start position:0%
that opening the ballots the day before
 
03:48:38.150 --> 03:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
which we were allowed to do during covid
 
03:48:42.050 --> 03:48:42.060 align:start position:0%
gave us a quiet time to open the ballots
 
03:48:44.929 --> 03:48:44.939 align:start position:0%
and make sure that the ballots the outer
 
03:48:48.950 --> 03:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
envelope that the affidavit envelope was
 
03:48:52.670 --> 03:48:52.680 align:start position:0%
completely signed and everything was
 
03:48:55.010 --> 03:48:55.020 align:start position:0%
all right with it and then we would
 
03:48:58.610 --> 03:48:58.620 align:start position:0%
highlight in our
 
03:49:01.550 --> 03:49:01.560 align:start position:0%
in our book the person's name
 
03:49:04.969 --> 03:49:04.979 align:start position:0%
so that the next day during election
 
03:49:06.769 --> 03:49:06.779 align:start position:0%
when the moderator when we had a quiet
 
03:49:09.790 --> 03:49:09.800 align:start position:0%
time if there was a quiet time
 
03:49:13.729 --> 03:49:13.739 align:start position:0%
the moderator would call out
 
03:49:16.250 --> 03:49:16.260 align:start position:0%
that name and we would put a line
 
03:49:19.490 --> 03:49:19.500 align:start position:0%
underneath we would note the ballot
 
03:49:21.769 --> 03:49:21.779 align:start position:0%
after it was opened whether it was a
 
03:49:23.929 --> 03:49:23.939 align:start position:0%
Democrat or Republican and then it was
 
03:49:27.410 --> 03:49:27.420 align:start position:0%
put in to the election box we are a hand
 
03:49:29.210 --> 03:49:29.220 align:start position:0%
count town and there's a lot of hand
 
03:49:31.910 --> 03:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
count towns in New Hampshire so this
 
03:49:34.090 --> 03:49:34.100 align:start position:0%
bill would help
 
03:49:38.510 --> 03:49:38.520 align:start position:0%
people who are running the election to
 
03:49:42.370 --> 03:49:42.380 align:start position:0%
be able to hear the moderator
 
03:49:44.929 --> 03:49:44.939 align:start position:0%
even when it's busy because they already
 
03:49:47.269 --> 03:49:47.279 align:start position:0%
know what's coming things are in order
 
03:49:49.250 --> 03:49:49.260 align:start position:0%
we know they're going to call they're
 
03:49:50.990 --> 03:49:51.000 align:start position:0%
going to call them in order and we're
 
03:49:52.490 --> 03:49:52.500 align:start position:0%
just going to go to that checkbook and
 
03:49:56.510 --> 03:49:56.520 align:start position:0%
say yes now now this ballot is going
 
03:49:58.910 --> 03:49:58.920 align:start position:0%
into the box
 
03:50:01.490 --> 03:50:01.500 align:start position:0%
so it's it's a simple build but it helps
 
03:50:04.070 --> 03:50:04.080 align:start position:0%
and it's transparent it's open to the
 
03:50:04.080 --> 03:50:04.790 align:start position:0%
and it's transparent it's open to the
public

03:50:04.790 --> 03:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
public
 
03:50:07.070 --> 03:50:07.080 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't
 
03:50:10.370 --> 03:50:10.380 align:start position:0%
um hurt anyone and it actually helps
 
03:50:12.710 --> 03:50:12.720 align:start position:0%
folks who may have forgot to put in a
 
03:50:15.650 --> 03:50:15.660 align:start position:0%
signature on it or their address so that
 
03:50:18.290 --> 03:50:18.300 align:start position:0%
as a clerk we can call them and say if
 
03:50:21.469 --> 03:50:21.479 align:start position:0%
it's the day before or two days before
 
03:50:23.210 --> 03:50:23.220 align:start position:0%
um It's usually the day before that we
 
03:50:25.729 --> 03:50:25.739 align:start position:0%
open it so it's the day before we can
 
03:50:28.910 --> 03:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
call that person and say are you still
 
03:50:32.330 --> 03:50:32.340 align:start position:0%
here today are you willing to come and
 
03:50:34.790 --> 03:50:34.800 align:start position:0%
sign your Ballot or whatever they forgot
 
03:50:38.510 --> 03:50:38.520 align:start position:0%
to put in so I think this is simple and
 
03:50:42.050 --> 03:50:42.060 align:start position:0%
easy and effective for small towns and
 
03:50:45.769 --> 03:50:45.779 align:start position:0%
I'd like to see the schematic committee
 
03:50:48.590 --> 03:50:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:51.490 --> 03:50:51.500 align:start position:0%
any questions questions
 
03:50:55.130 --> 03:50:55.140 align:start position:0%
Hamlet thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:50:57.110 --> 03:50:57.120 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
03:50:59.809 --> 03:50:59.819 align:start position:0%
um I like I like the idea of being able
 
03:51:01.729 --> 03:51:01.739 align:start position:0%
to open the outer envelopes before
 
03:51:04.370 --> 03:51:04.380 align:start position:0%
election day and I think what during
 
03:51:07.190 --> 03:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
covet I think in Portsmouth we started
 
03:51:09.530 --> 03:51:09.540 align:start position:0%
the opening process on Friday or
 
03:51:12.710 --> 03:51:12.720 align:start position:0%
Saturday before the election of course
 
03:51:14.510 --> 03:51:14.520 align:start position:0%
there were a lot more absentee ballots
 
03:51:16.910 --> 03:51:16.920 align:start position:0%
than what would you be willing to change
 
03:51:20.090 --> 03:51:20.100 align:start position:0%
the date instead of the Monday prior to
 
03:51:22.969 --> 03:51:22.979 align:start position:0%
a few days earlier I would absolutely
 
03:51:25.070 --> 03:51:25.080 align:start position:0%
like that because then it gives if that
 
03:51:28.190 --> 03:51:28.200 align:start position:0%
person was leaving the day that we are
 
03:51:31.429 --> 03:51:31.439 align:start position:0%
opening them obviously we won't have
 
03:51:34.190 --> 03:51:34.200 align:start position:0%
that ability to help them so I I would
 
03:51:35.570 --> 03:51:35.580 align:start position:0%
definitely do that I think we picked
 
03:51:37.910 --> 03:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
that date because that's what we were
 
03:51:40.849 --> 03:51:40.859 align:start position:0%
given during coven that day before and I
 
03:51:42.349 --> 03:51:42.359 align:start position:0%
don't know if it was a decision by our
 
03:51:44.630 --> 03:51:44.640 align:start position:0%
moderator or whether it came down from
 
03:51:47.570 --> 03:51:47.580 align:start position:0%
the state so yes we would be happy to do
 
03:51:49.130 --> 03:51:49.140 align:start position:0%
that okay thank you
 
03:51:51.590 --> 03:51:51.600 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
03:51:53.690 --> 03:51:53.700 align:start position:0%
I I have a question
 
03:51:53.700 --> 03:51:54.349 align:start position:0%
I I have a question
um

03:51:54.349 --> 03:51:54.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:51:56.330 --> 03:51:56.340 align:start position:0%
how does this not create two classes of
 
03:51:58.610 --> 03:51:58.620 align:start position:0%
Voters so you've got the voters who will
 
03:52:00.170 --> 03:52:00.180 align:start position:0%
receive your ballot curing protections
 
03:52:01.729 --> 03:52:01.739 align:start position:0%
the Monday before the election and
 
03:52:02.809 --> 03:52:02.819 align:start position:0%
you'll have the voters who are having
 
03:52:04.490 --> 03:52:04.500 align:start position:0%
their absentee ballots that arrive on
 
03:52:06.290 --> 03:52:06.300 align:start position:0%
Election Day they will not receive that
 
03:52:06.300 --> 03:52:07.910 align:start position:0%
Election Day they will not receive that
protection

03:52:07.910 --> 03:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
protection
 
03:52:10.130 --> 03:52:10.140 align:start position:0%
um you said in there your intention is
 
03:52:11.570 --> 03:52:11.580 align:start position:0%
to allow people to ballot cure that's
 
03:52:12.530 --> 03:52:12.540 align:start position:0%
what it's called it's called ballot
 
03:52:12.540 --> 03:52:14.870 align:start position:0%
what it's called it's called ballot
caring

03:52:14.870 --> 03:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
caring
 
03:52:16.370 --> 03:52:16.380 align:start position:0%
um how do you how are you not creating
 
03:52:18.469 --> 03:52:18.479 align:start position:0%
two classes of Voters at that point and
 
03:52:20.090 --> 03:52:20.100 align:start position:0%
if you move it even farther forward
 
03:52:21.830 --> 03:52:21.840 align:start position:0%
you're even you're creating even more
 
03:52:25.250 --> 03:52:25.260 align:start position:0%
you're loading up that second class
 
03:52:28.370 --> 03:52:28.380 align:start position:0%
I I don't have an answer to that
 
03:52:28.380 --> 03:52:29.690 align:start position:0%
I I don't have an answer to that
um I

03:52:29.690 --> 03:52:29.700 align:start position:0%
um I
 
03:52:31.550 --> 03:52:31.560 align:start position:0%
people send in their ballots and it gets
 
03:52:33.889 --> 03:52:33.899 align:start position:0%
there uh by that date those people have
 
03:52:35.990 --> 03:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
the ability to
 
03:52:39.710 --> 03:52:39.720 align:start position:0%
um you know receive a call or be able to
 
03:52:42.769 --> 03:52:42.779 align:start position:0%
change not change anything but fill in
 
03:52:44.510 --> 03:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
informations that you've left for a
 
03:52:44.520 --> 03:52:45.530 align:start position:0%
informations that you've left for a
blank

03:52:45.530 --> 03:52:45.540 align:start position:0%
blank
 
03:52:48.170 --> 03:52:48.180 align:start position:0%
um I I understand that your thought is
 
03:52:50.870 --> 03:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
there's another class of people that
 
03:52:50.880 --> 03:52:51.950 align:start position:0%
there's another class of people that
aren't

03:52:51.950 --> 03:52:51.960 align:start position:0%
aren't
 
03:52:54.910 --> 03:52:54.920 align:start position:0%
um now able to change their ballot
 
03:52:58.250 --> 03:52:58.260 align:start position:0%
because it is election day but
 
03:53:00.650 --> 03:53:00.660 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I mean it's the same thing
 
03:53:03.110 --> 03:53:03.120 align:start position:0%
with people who are voting who don't
 
03:53:06.769 --> 03:53:06.779 align:start position:0%
fill out an absentee ballot in time to
 
03:53:09.469 --> 03:53:09.479 align:start position:0%
get to us that don't really get counted
 
03:53:11.450 --> 03:53:11.460 align:start position:0%
so I think there is already another
 
03:53:15.050 --> 03:53:15.060 align:start position:0%
class of of people that don't have that
 
03:53:17.210 --> 03:53:17.220 align:start position:0%
ability to
 
03:53:19.490 --> 03:53:19.500 align:start position:0%
um have that same consideration
 
03:53:21.110 --> 03:53:21.120 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
03:53:22.849 --> 03:53:22.859 align:start position:0%
representative Grill
 
03:53:24.110 --> 03:53:24.120 align:start position:0%
uh yeah I sort of have a question
 
03:53:25.910 --> 03:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
following up on representative Barry's
 
03:53:27.710 --> 03:53:27.720 align:start position:0%
question and thank you for
 
03:53:29.510 --> 03:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr Karen thanks for taking
 
03:53:30.830 --> 03:53:30.840 align:start position:0%
the question I should have started with
 
03:53:30.840 --> 03:53:32.090 align:start position:0%
the question I should have started with
that

03:53:32.090 --> 03:53:32.100 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:53:32.100 --> 03:53:32.750 align:start position:0%
that
um

03:53:32.750 --> 03:53:32.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:53:35.210 --> 03:53:35.220 align:start position:0%
the um absentee ballots
 
03:53:36.769 --> 03:53:36.779 align:start position:0%
um in terms of like the envelopes and
 
03:53:37.969 --> 03:53:37.979 align:start position:0%
the additional materials that come with
 
03:53:37.979 --> 03:53:38.809 align:start position:0%
the additional materials that come with
them

03:53:38.809 --> 03:53:38.819 align:start position:0%
them
 
03:53:41.690 --> 03:53:41.700 align:start position:0%
um do in-person ballots cast
 
03:53:44.030 --> 03:53:44.040 align:start position:0%
um require the same process as far as
 
03:53:46.190 --> 03:53:46.200 align:start position:0%
completing the affidavit and the
 
03:53:48.469 --> 03:53:48.479 align:start position:0%
envelope yes they do so that that
 
03:53:50.450 --> 03:53:50.460 align:start position:0%
envelope goes out with
 
03:53:52.070 --> 03:53:52.080 align:start position:0%
um I believe three envelopes there's an
 
03:53:53.929 --> 03:53:53.939 align:start position:0%
outer envelope there's the affidavit
 
03:53:55.370 --> 03:53:55.380 align:start position:0%
envelope and then there's the ballot
 
03:53:57.830 --> 03:53:57.840 align:start position:0%
envelope and the ballot envelope isn't
 
03:54:00.889 --> 03:54:00.899 align:start position:0%
opened at all until the day of the
 
03:54:03.050 --> 03:54:03.060 align:start position:0%
election and the problems that we have
 
03:54:05.210 --> 03:54:05.220 align:start position:0%
in our town is we have a very high
 
03:54:07.550 --> 03:54:07.560 align:start position:0%
ceiling and when people are coming in
 
03:54:09.769 --> 03:54:09.779 align:start position:0%
going through it's really noisy so
 
03:54:13.309 --> 03:54:13.319 align:start position:0%
having that ability to avoid mistakes in
 
03:54:15.349 --> 03:54:15.359 align:start position:0%
our checklist is really important
 
03:54:17.870 --> 03:54:17.880 align:start position:0%
because the end of the night when and
 
03:54:19.250 --> 03:54:19.260 align:start position:0%
especially during a presidential
 
03:54:19.260 --> 03:54:20.349 align:start position:0%
especially during a presidential
election

03:54:20.349 --> 03:54:20.359 align:start position:0%
election
 
03:54:24.050 --> 03:54:24.060 align:start position:0%
you have different ballot clerks that
 
03:54:27.469 --> 03:54:27.479 align:start position:0%
have messed up they checked another name
 
03:54:29.689 --> 03:54:29.699 align:start position:0%
it's a similar name and things like that
 
03:54:31.429 --> 03:54:31.439 align:start position:0%
and we spend all night trying to figure
 
03:54:34.729 --> 03:54:34.739 align:start position:0%
out you know how to fix this and where
 
03:54:37.849 --> 03:54:37.859 align:start position:0%
the problem is so I I do think it's a
 
03:54:42.650 --> 03:54:42.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:45.290 --> 03:54:45.300 align:start position:0%
um so if a voter is asked to cure their
 
03:54:47.689 --> 03:54:47.699 align:start position:0%
ballot in advance of the election day um
 
03:54:49.490 --> 03:54:49.500 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't be allowed to alter any
 
03:54:51.769 --> 03:54:51.779 align:start position:0%
markings on the ballot itself just the
 
03:54:53.389 --> 03:54:53.399 align:start position:0%
um envelope and additional materials
 
03:54:54.469 --> 03:54:54.479 align:start position:0%
that come with the absentee ballot
 
03:54:57.170 --> 03:54:57.180 align:start position:0%
correct correct okay thank you I'd like
 
03:54:58.969 --> 03:54:58.979 align:start position:0%
to follow that why not
 
03:55:01.849 --> 03:55:01.859 align:start position:0%
why not why not well it depends what
 
03:55:03.830 --> 03:55:03.840 align:start position:0%
whether we've already opened the
 
03:55:08.090 --> 03:55:08.100 align:start position:0%
envelope right it it if it's ballot day
 
03:55:10.849 --> 03:55:10.859 align:start position:0%
and they come in and they decide
 
03:55:12.889 --> 03:55:12.899 align:start position:0%
um it's election day excuse me and they
 
03:55:16.070 --> 03:55:16.080 align:start position:0%
come in and we've already opened the
 
03:55:18.950 --> 03:55:18.960 align:start position:0%
ballots to put in the box that that's
 
03:55:21.290 --> 03:55:21.300 align:start position:0%
said and done we can't change that we
 
03:55:23.630 --> 03:55:23.640 align:start position:0%
can't take it out of The Ballot Box if
 
03:55:26.150 --> 03:55:26.160 align:start position:0%
they come in early enough before we do
 
03:55:28.969 --> 03:55:28.979 align:start position:0%
it then there is a possibility they can
 
03:55:31.250 --> 03:55:31.260 align:start position:0%
pull that ballot back
 
03:55:34.969 --> 03:55:34.979 align:start position:0%
but but it's it depends on the timing
 
03:55:37.070 --> 03:55:37.080 align:start position:0%
couldn't they just come in before 8 A.M
 
03:55:38.870 --> 03:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
and vote regularly That's the Law as it
 
03:55:39.830 --> 03:55:39.840 align:start position:0%
is today
 
03:55:42.349 --> 03:55:42.359 align:start position:0%
well we don't open till 8 A.M so was it
 
03:55:43.849 --> 03:55:43.859 align:start position:0%
eight hours in noon I can't forget it I
 
03:55:45.769 --> 03:55:45.779 align:start position:0%
think it's eight Ryan
 
03:55:47.510 --> 03:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
03:55:49.250 --> 03:55:49.260 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
03:55:50.630 --> 03:55:50.640 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
03:55:50.640 --> 03:55:51.410 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
question

03:55:51.410 --> 03:55:51.420 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:55:53.330 --> 03:55:53.340 align:start position:0%
the text in this bill
 
03:55:55.490 --> 03:55:55.500 align:start position:0%
s about the voters
 
03:55:58.070 --> 03:55:58.080 align:start position:0%
shall be announced and an opportunity
 
03:56:00.170 --> 03:56:00.180 align:start position:0%
for a challenge of the ballot shall be
 
03:56:00.180 --> 03:56:01.429 align:start position:0%
for a challenge of the ballot shall be
given

03:56:01.429 --> 03:56:01.439 align:start position:0%
given
 
03:56:04.070 --> 03:56:04.080 align:start position:0%
and then it also talks about identifying
 
03:56:08.750 --> 03:56:08.760 align:start position:0%
in a primary if there is a if they've
 
03:56:13.070 --> 03:56:13.080 align:start position:0%
pulled a Dem or a republican ballot is
 
03:56:16.309 --> 03:56:16.319 align:start position:0%
there any concern about
 
03:56:16.319 --> 03:56:17.090 align:start position:0%
there any concern about
um

03:56:17.090 --> 03:56:17.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:56:20.689 --> 03:56:20.699 align:start position:0%
privacy and the you know
 
03:56:22.429 --> 03:56:22.439 align:start position:0%
secret ballot
 
03:56:24.650 --> 03:56:24.660 align:start position:0%
so with the first section where the
 
03:56:27.889 --> 03:56:27.899 align:start position:0%
outer envelope is being opened we're not
 
03:56:30.969 --> 03:56:30.979 align:start position:0%
announcing a name we're looking to see
 
03:56:34.429 --> 03:56:34.439 align:start position:0%
if all the information on the affidavit
 
03:56:36.290 --> 03:56:36.300 align:start position:0%
because the affidavit is on the outside
 
03:56:38.929 --> 03:56:38.939 align:start position:0%
of the envelope that they fill out and
 
03:56:41.210 --> 03:56:41.220 align:start position:0%
they we open the the first envelope and
 
03:56:43.189 --> 03:56:43.199 align:start position:0%
there's the affidavit envelope and
 
03:56:45.590 --> 03:56:45.600 align:start position:0%
inside the Avid envelope is then their
 
03:56:48.229 --> 03:56:48.239 align:start position:0%
ballot so we just look at the front is
 
03:56:51.229 --> 03:56:51.239 align:start position:0%
this a valid affidavit is it signed is
 
03:56:54.530 --> 03:56:54.540 align:start position:0%
it completed and and that is all we're
 
03:56:58.610 --> 03:56:58.620 align:start position:0%
looking for and at that point we
 
03:57:01.670 --> 03:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
highlight the names of that person on
 
03:57:05.510 --> 03:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
the ballot on on the checklist excuse me
 
03:57:07.309 --> 03:57:07.319 align:start position:0%
Paula yeah of course
 
03:57:07.319 --> 03:57:08.689 align:start position:0%
Paula yeah of course
so

03:57:08.689 --> 03:57:08.699 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:57:12.650 --> 03:57:12.660 align:start position:0%
why would it say the voter's name shall
 
03:57:15.229 --> 03:57:15.239 align:start position:0%
be announced and and let me just clarify
 
03:57:15.239 --> 03:57:16.490 align:start position:0%
be announced and and let me just clarify
that

03:57:16.490 --> 03:57:16.500 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:57:19.670 --> 03:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
um part of your testimony was that this
 
03:57:21.769 --> 03:57:21.779 align:start position:0%
is about transparency and the public
 
03:57:23.689 --> 03:57:23.699 align:start position:0%
would be able to view this and now
 
03:57:25.790 --> 03:57:25.800 align:start position:0%
you're going to have people opening
 
03:57:31.490 --> 03:57:31.500 align:start position:0%
these envelopes announcing voters names
 
03:57:34.070 --> 03:57:34.080 align:start position:0%
um identifying that that voter has voted
 
03:57:36.229 --> 03:57:36.239 align:start position:0%
absentee to the public is that something
 
03:57:38.450 --> 03:57:38.460 align:start position:0%
that is standard practice and that is
 
03:57:40.670 --> 03:57:40.680 align:start position:0%
standard practice for us
 
03:57:43.130 --> 03:57:43.140 align:start position:0%
um I I don't know how others towns do it
 
03:57:46.090 --> 03:57:46.100 align:start position:0%
but whether it be
 
03:57:50.389 --> 03:57:50.399 align:start position:0%
we are you know in the middle of of the
 
03:57:50.399 --> 03:57:51.130 align:start position:0%
we are you know in the middle of of the
election

03:57:51.130 --> 03:57:51.140 align:start position:0%
election
 
03:57:55.130 --> 03:57:55.140 align:start position:0%
we try to wait for a law and the
 
03:57:58.670 --> 03:57:58.680 align:start position:0%
moderator and this is without this the
 
03:58:01.610 --> 03:58:01.620 align:start position:0%
moderator announces uh the person's name
 
03:58:06.650 --> 03:58:06.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:08.330 --> 03:58:08.340 align:start position:0%
representative way
 
03:58:10.010 --> 03:58:10.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
03:58:13.070 --> 03:58:13.080 align:start position:0%
my question so the first part is really
 
03:58:16.130 --> 03:58:16.140 align:start position:0%
just about verification of the affidavit
 
03:58:16.140 --> 03:58:17.389 align:start position:0%
just about verification of the affidavit
correct

03:58:17.389 --> 03:58:17.399 align:start position:0%
correct
 
03:58:21.590 --> 03:58:21.600 align:start position:0%
that's all it is and it it during covid
 
03:58:23.150 --> 03:58:23.160 align:start position:0%
um there was and and they everybody
 
03:58:25.670 --> 03:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
talks about election Integrity now this
 
03:58:28.250 --> 03:58:28.260 align:start position:0%
helps election Integrity because now
 
03:58:31.849 --> 03:58:31.859 align:start position:0%
these folks who would have
 
03:58:33.710 --> 03:58:33.720 align:start position:0%
um their ballots may not have been
 
03:58:33.720 --> 03:58:35.269 align:start position:0%
um their ballots may not have been
counted

03:58:35.269 --> 03:58:35.279 align:start position:0%
counted
 
03:58:38.809 --> 03:58:38.819 align:start position:0%
um were validated to be counted
 
03:58:40.250 --> 03:58:40.260 align:start position:0%
um then
 
03:58:42.170 --> 03:58:42.180 align:start position:0%
now they have the opportunity to do that
 
03:58:44.510 --> 03:58:44.520 align:start position:0%
so that gives you know a little more
 
03:58:48.950 --> 03:58:48.960 align:start position:0%

03:58:58.189 --> 03:58:58.199 align:start position:0%
further questions on the committee
 
03:59:00.710 --> 03:59:00.720 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative O'Brien thank you

thank you Mr chairman
 
03:59:02.520 --> 03:59:04.490 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
uh

03:59:04.490 --> 03:59:04.500 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:59:07.809 --> 03:59:07.819 align:start position:0%
has the amount of absentee ballots
 
03:59:11.809 --> 03:59:11.819 align:start position:0%
remained consistent since covid or has
 
03:59:13.990 --> 03:59:14.000 align:start position:0%
it changed it's it's
 
03:59:17.510 --> 03:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
yeah yes it has changed during covet a
 
03:59:18.710 --> 03:59:18.720 align:start position:0%
lot of people used it because they could
 
03:59:20.929 --> 03:59:20.939 align:start position:0%
use it for anything so now we've gone
 
03:59:23.929 --> 03:59:23.939 align:start position:0%
back to just the normal I mean uh we're
 
03:59:27.410 --> 03:59:27.420 align:start position:0%
a small town and we have a great voter
 
03:59:30.170 --> 03:59:30.180 align:start position:0%
turnout and people want to come out and
 
03:59:32.389 --> 03:59:32.399 align:start position:0%
see their neighbors and talk and have
 
03:59:37.010 --> 03:59:37.020 align:start position:0%
chili and gather so at least for us as a
 
03:59:40.550 --> 03:59:40.560 align:start position:0%
community we find more people want to be
 
03:59:43.670 --> 03:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
out see their neighbors especially if
 
03:59:46.550 --> 03:59:46.560 align:start position:0%
there's not a lot of snow on the ground
 
03:59:48.290 --> 03:59:48.300 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
03:59:50.330 --> 03:59:50.340 align:start position:0%
we'll find out about snow today
 
03:59:52.309 --> 03:59:52.319 align:start position:0%
all right well that's uh that I think
 
03:59:54.170 --> 03:59:54.180 align:start position:0%
only have one other card
 
03:59:56.809 --> 03:59:56.819 align:start position:0%
um Dan Healy oh thank you I assume
 
03:59:58.250 --> 03:59:58.260 align:start position:0%
there's nobody in the question so I I
 
04:00:09.710 --> 04:00:09.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:12.170 --> 04:00:12.180 align:start position:0%
hi Dan Healy uh representing New
 
04:00:13.490 --> 04:00:13.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire City and town clerks
 
04:00:15.950 --> 04:00:15.960 align:start position:0%
Association I'll be real brief with this
 
04:00:19.969 --> 04:00:19.979 align:start position:0%
our association supports this bill uh we
 
04:00:21.590 --> 04:00:21.600 align:start position:0%
would just like to see the date move
 
04:00:24.410 --> 04:00:24.420 align:start position:0%
from Monday to Friday to give us a
 
04:00:28.269 --> 04:00:28.279 align:start position:0%
couple days to actually process
 
04:00:31.309 --> 04:00:31.319 align:start position:0%
those ballots so if it could be moved to
 
04:00:34.550 --> 04:00:34.560 align:start position:0%
Friday we could start Friday we could do
 
04:00:38.210 --> 04:00:38.220 align:start position:0%
it Saturday Sunday Monday give clerks
 
04:00:40.750 --> 04:00:40.760 align:start position:0%
some time to to get this accomplished
 
04:00:44.870 --> 04:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:44.880 --> 04:00:47.150 align:start position:0%
 
representative

04:00:47.150 --> 04:00:47.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:00:52.250 --> 04:00:52.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:55.969 --> 04:00:55.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:59.150 --> 04:00:59.160 align:start position:0%
in the bill for during covid when it was
 
04:01:01.130 --> 04:01:01.140 align:start position:0%
changed it talked about you had to
 
04:01:02.929 --> 04:01:02.939 align:start position:0%
publicly announce when you were going to
 
04:01:05.450 --> 04:01:05.460 align:start position:0%
do this so if we're going to change it
 
04:01:08.689 --> 04:01:08.699 align:start position:0%
to Friday would you be okay with the
 
04:01:10.490 --> 04:01:10.500 align:start position:0%
provision that you have to announce when
 
04:01:11.630 --> 04:01:11.640 align:start position:0%
you're going to do it because it could
 
04:01:13.550 --> 04:01:13.560 align:start position:0%
be Friday Saturday I doubt you're going
 
04:01:16.010 --> 04:01:16.020 align:start position:0%
to do Sunday but or Monday so that would
 
04:01:18.950 --> 04:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
be okay to do that okay thank you
 
04:01:21.050 --> 04:01:21.060 align:start position:0%
representative weary
 
04:01:22.790 --> 04:01:22.800 align:start position:0%
and just kind of following up on that
 
04:01:24.710 --> 04:01:24.720 align:start position:0%
that those would be like reasonable
 
04:01:27.710 --> 04:01:27.720 align:start position:0%
hours you know normal kind of business
 
04:01:30.110 --> 04:01:30.120 align:start position:0%
hours yes
 
04:01:33.710 --> 04:01:33.720 align:start position:0%
um in having it you know start Friday so
 
04:01:35.870 --> 04:01:35.880 align:start position:0%
we could post that we're doing this
 
04:01:38.450 --> 04:01:38.460 align:start position:0%
Saturday during you know during the day
 
04:01:41.330 --> 04:01:41.340 align:start position:0%
or something along those lines where we
 
04:01:43.550 --> 04:01:43.560 align:start position:0%
would have the staff to do it and people
 
04:01:49.309 --> 04:01:49.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:51.469 --> 04:01:51.479 align:start position:0%
okay are there any other questions
 
04:01:55.309 --> 04:01:55.319 align:start position:0%
I have one why not just count them there
 
04:01:57.710 --> 04:01:57.720 align:start position:0%
on Election Day no you've already opened
 
04:02:01.010 --> 04:02:01.020 align:start position:0%
up the ballots why not just count them
 
04:02:02.510 --> 04:02:02.520 align:start position:0%
if you're pre-processing them it's gonna
 
04:02:04.370 --> 04:02:04.380 align:start position:0%
be faster I want to just count them
 
04:02:06.349 --> 04:02:06.359 align:start position:0%
I don't believe with current law we can
 
04:02:08.349 --> 04:02:08.359 align:start position:0%
until election day
 
04:02:11.510 --> 04:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
all right any other questions
 
04:02:14.450 --> 04:02:14.460 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you uh next up is Luis
 
04:02:14.460 --> 04:02:20.870 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you uh next up is Luis
Spencer

04:02:20.870 --> 04:02:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:23.689 --> 04:02:23.699 align:start position:0%
welcome hi thank you for taking my last
 
04:02:25.729 --> 04:02:25.739 align:start position:0%
minute request to speak
 
04:02:28.370 --> 04:02:28.380 align:start position:0%
um I'm Louise Spencer I'm from Concord
 
04:02:31.250 --> 04:02:31.260 align:start position:0%
I'm with the Kent Street Coalition which
 
04:02:33.830 --> 04:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
is an all volunteer Grassroots advocacy
 
04:02:36.590 --> 04:02:36.600 align:start position:0%
organization today I'm speaking on my
 
04:02:39.530 --> 04:02:39.540 align:start position:0%
own behalf I obviously had not planned
 
04:02:41.689 --> 04:02:41.699 align:start position:0%
to speak but hearing the sponsor on this
 
04:02:41.699 --> 04:02:42.469 align:start position:0%
to speak but hearing the sponsor on this
bill

04:02:42.469 --> 04:02:42.479 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:02:46.189 --> 04:02:46.199 align:start position:0%
and having observed pre-processing
 
04:02:46.199 --> 04:02:46.790 align:start position:0%
and having observed pre-processing
um

04:02:46.790 --> 04:02:46.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:02:50.870 --> 04:02:50.880 align:start position:0%
in in several different towns I
 
04:02:54.889 --> 04:02:54.899 align:start position:0%
um I really do underscore and the value
 
04:02:58.450 --> 04:02:58.460 align:start position:0%
of having that ability to do that
 
04:03:01.309 --> 04:03:01.319 align:start position:0%
my concern about this bill was that it
 
04:03:03.650 --> 04:03:03.660 align:start position:0%
was uh so late on Monday that it it
 
04:03:06.349 --> 04:03:06.359 align:start position:0%
would not necessarily give a lot of time
 
04:03:08.689 --> 04:03:08.699 align:start position:0%
to the um
 
04:03:12.170 --> 04:03:12.180 align:start position:0%
to do the curing of the ballots and also
 
04:03:15.349 --> 04:03:15.359 align:start position:0%
that it you know clerks are very busy
 
04:03:17.090 --> 04:03:17.100 align:start position:0%
getting ready
 
04:03:20.150 --> 04:03:20.160 align:start position:0%
um for the election the next day
 
04:03:22.610 --> 04:03:22.620 align:start position:0%
um so the Monday dates seemed
 
04:03:25.610 --> 04:03:25.620 align:start position:0%
problematic but to the extent that the
 
04:03:27.830 --> 04:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
date as several have mentioned here
 
04:03:30.610 --> 04:03:30.620 align:start position:0%
would be moved even to Friday
 
04:03:34.429 --> 04:03:34.439 align:start position:0%
I would fully support this bill I will
 
04:03:37.370 --> 04:03:37.380 align:start position:0%
say that having participated in
 
04:03:40.910 --> 04:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
observing this process and seeing
 
04:03:44.090 --> 04:03:44.100 align:start position:0%
um clerks and other election officials
 
04:03:46.670 --> 04:03:46.680 align:start position:0%
reaching out to voters they are so
 
04:03:49.370 --> 04:03:49.380 align:start position:0%
grateful uh you know if they just forgot
 
04:03:51.590 --> 04:03:51.600 align:start position:0%
to sign the affidavit they're so
 
04:03:53.630 --> 04:03:53.640 align:start position:0%
grateful for that opportunity to fix
 
04:03:56.330 --> 04:03:56.340 align:start position:0%
that and this is both Republicans and
 
04:03:59.870 --> 04:03:59.880 align:start position:0%
Democrats it's not a this is a very
 
04:04:03.950 --> 04:04:03.960 align:start position:0%
bipartisan issue a very easy mistake to
 
04:04:07.610 --> 04:04:07.620 align:start position:0%
make I often am out observing elections
 
04:04:10.790 --> 04:04:10.800 align:start position:0%
on Election Day I usually vote absentee
 
04:04:13.250 --> 04:04:13.260 align:start position:0%
ballot I get nervous every single time I
 
04:04:15.729 --> 04:04:15.739 align:start position:0%
do it like have I gotten it all right
 
04:04:19.429 --> 04:04:19.439 align:start position:0%
it's you know people worry about this
 
04:04:21.110 --> 04:04:21.120 align:start position:0%
and they want to do it right but
 
04:04:23.570 --> 04:04:23.580 align:start position:0%
sometimes they don't so this provides a
 
04:04:25.969 --> 04:04:25.979 align:start position:0%
great opportunity for every vote to be
 
04:04:29.150 --> 04:04:29.160 align:start position:0%
counted so thank you very much
 
04:04:31.250 --> 04:04:31.260 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
04:04:34.189 --> 04:04:34.199 align:start position:0%
all right that was easy
 
04:04:35.330 --> 04:04:35.340 align:start position:0%
um with that Q uh representative
 
04:04:46.969 --> 04:04:46.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:49.070 --> 04:04:49.080 align:start position:0%
okay thank you this is yeah it's
 
04:04:49.080 --> 04:04:50.570 align:start position:0%
okay thank you this is yeah it's

04:04:50.570 --> 04:04:50.580 align:start position:0%
extensive
 
04:04:50.580 --> 04:04:51.469 align:start position:0%
extensive

04:04:51.469 --> 04:04:51.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:04:53.870 --> 04:04:53.880 align:start position:0%
so uh out of those who did not speak uh
 
04:04:56.630 --> 04:04:56.640 align:start position:0%
one person signed in and they were for
 
04:04:59.510 --> 04:04:59.520 align:start position:0%

04:05:55.189 --> 04:05:55.199 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman and
 
04:05:56.269 --> 04:05:56.279 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
04:05:58.550 --> 04:05:58.560 align:start position:0%
my name is Dan McGuire I represent the
 
04:06:00.050 --> 04:06:00.060 align:start position:0%
town of Epsom
 
04:06:03.830 --> 04:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
so the this is a non-partisan election
 
04:06:06.050 --> 04:06:06.060 align:start position:0%
law bill it's it's a simple and
 
04:06:08.570 --> 04:06:08.580 align:start position:0%
hopefully a little bit fun
 
04:06:12.010 --> 04:06:12.020 align:start position:0%
um it stems from an experience I had
 
04:06:14.809 --> 04:06:14.819 align:start position:0%
observing a recount
 
04:06:16.910 --> 04:06:16.920 align:start position:0%
so if you've never done that before I
 
04:06:20.750 --> 04:06:20.760 align:start position:0%
highly recommend that you go and watch a
 
04:06:23.630 --> 04:06:23.640 align:start position:0%
recount because actually seeing actual
 
04:06:26.689 --> 04:06:26.699 align:start position:0%
ballots tells you something about the
 
04:06:28.670 --> 04:06:28.680 align:start position:0%
minds of Voters and things like that you
 
04:06:30.110 --> 04:06:30.120 align:start position:0%
would think that it would be just very
 
04:06:32.990 --> 04:06:33.000 align:start position:0%
dry but it actually isn't it's it's it's
 
04:06:33.000 --> 04:06:35.090 align:start position:0%
dry but it actually isn't it's it's it's
interesting

04:06:35.090 --> 04:06:35.100 align:start position:0%
interesting
 
04:06:39.229 --> 04:06:39.239 align:start position:0%
um and and you know 98 or something of
 
04:06:41.809 --> 04:06:41.819 align:start position:0%
all all uh ballots are voted normally
 
04:06:44.210 --> 04:06:44.220 align:start position:0%
there's nothing weird about them and so
 
04:06:46.670 --> 04:06:46.680 align:start position:0%
on but every once in a while there are
 
04:06:49.670 --> 04:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
strange marks on the ballots and people
 
04:06:51.590 --> 04:06:51.600 align:start position:0%
have to the people doing the counting
 
04:06:54.950 --> 04:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
have to use some judgment about what was
 
04:06:56.929 --> 04:06:56.939 align:start position:0%
the intention of the voter in that case
 
04:06:59.929 --> 04:06:59.939 align:start position:0%
right so and when you're doing a recount
 
04:07:04.130 --> 04:07:04.140 align:start position:0%
it's very important that every vote be
 
04:07:06.410 --> 04:07:06.420 align:start position:0%
judged correctly and consistently
 
04:07:09.650 --> 04:07:09.660 align:start position:0%
because that's a very close election I
 
04:07:11.389 --> 04:07:11.399 align:start position:0%
mean by definition you're in a recount
 
04:07:13.969 --> 04:07:13.979 align:start position:0%
because it's within a few votes of
 
04:07:17.450 --> 04:07:17.460 align:start position:0%
deciding who wins so in this particular
 
04:07:20.030 --> 04:07:20.040 align:start position:0%
recount that I was in watching years ago
 
04:07:21.950 --> 04:07:21.960 align:start position:0%
if you look at the left hand side of
 
04:07:24.410 --> 04:07:24.420 align:start position:0%
your page there was a ballot that looked
 
04:07:26.750 --> 04:07:26.760 align:start position:0%
very much like that all right you see
 
04:07:29.990 --> 04:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
this this is a a ballot from some
 
04:07:33.410 --> 04:07:33.420 align:start position:0%
partisan voter right the the voters the
 
04:07:36.769 --> 04:07:36.779 align:start position:0%
member of the dog party right and uh but
 
04:07:39.889 --> 04:07:39.899 align:start position:0%
we were in we were recounting
 
04:07:41.750 --> 04:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
um the election for executive counselor
 
04:07:45.110 --> 04:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
in this case right so the question is is
 
04:07:47.510 --> 04:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
this of is there a vote on this ballot
 
04:07:52.010 --> 04:07:52.020 align:start position:0%
from for H Jones or not
 
04:07:55.490 --> 04:07:55.500 align:start position:0%
okay and there's no right answer right
 
04:07:57.650 --> 04:07:57.660 align:start position:0%
just think about it to yourself if you
 
04:07:59.990 --> 04:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
were seeing this valid
 
04:08:02.330 --> 04:08:02.340 align:start position:0%
um and and you were recounting the
 
04:08:04.849 --> 04:08:04.859 align:start position:0%
executive counselor is it's either they
 
04:08:06.769 --> 04:08:06.779 align:start position:0%
didn't vote for executive counselor or
 
04:08:09.349 --> 04:08:09.359 align:start position:0%
they voted for H Jones right so the
 
04:08:12.410 --> 04:08:12.420 align:start position:0%
question is which one is it and so when
 
04:08:15.650 --> 04:08:15.660 align:start position:0%
I was watching I had in my mind that
 
04:08:18.650 --> 04:08:18.660 align:start position:0%
they did not vote for H Jones in this
 
04:08:18.660 --> 04:08:19.849 align:start position:0%
they did not vote for H Jones in this
case

04:08:19.849 --> 04:08:19.859 align:start position:0%
case
 
04:08:22.550 --> 04:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
um but when this ballot went to the
 
04:08:25.670 --> 04:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State to be counted the
 
04:08:27.650 --> 04:08:27.660 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State said yes that's a
 
04:08:31.370 --> 04:08:31.380 align:start position:0%
vote for H Jones okay and and I thought
 
04:08:33.530 --> 04:08:33.540 align:start position:0%
well that's kind of weird right what's
 
04:08:36.370 --> 04:08:36.380 align:start position:0%
the logic so so in my mind the logic is
 
04:08:39.229 --> 04:08:39.239 align:start position:0%
this person clearly knows how to vote
 
04:08:42.290 --> 04:08:42.300 align:start position:0%
you know simply and correctly uh their
 
04:08:43.849 --> 04:08:43.859 align:start position:0%
pen didn't run out of ink or something
 
04:08:46.490 --> 04:08:46.500 align:start position:0%
like that they started to vote for H
 
04:08:48.830 --> 04:08:48.840 align:start position:0%
Jones right they circled the edge of the
 
04:08:51.469 --> 04:08:51.479 align:start position:0%
bat of the circle but then they stopped
 
04:08:55.969 --> 04:08:55.979 align:start position:0%
so they said maybe not right and so
 
04:08:58.790 --> 04:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
therefore it's not a vote but but the
 
04:09:01.010 --> 04:09:01.020 align:start position:0%
secretary do you have state ruled well
 
04:09:02.630 --> 04:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a mark there so
 
04:09:04.490 --> 04:09:04.500 align:start position:0%
therefore it is about right you know I
 
04:09:05.570 --> 04:09:05.580 align:start position:0%
don't think there's a right or wrong
 
04:09:08.990 --> 04:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
answer it's just it's just the point is
 
04:09:12.290 --> 04:09:12.300 align:start position:0%
I think that two people doing this
 
04:09:15.410 --> 04:09:15.420 align:start position:0%
process of of determining votes should
 
04:09:17.450 --> 04:09:17.460 align:start position:0%
be do the same thing
 
04:09:22.910 --> 04:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
right in in all cases if as possible
 
04:09:24.590 --> 04:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
um two people looking at the same ballot
 
04:09:26.870 --> 04:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
should come to the same conclusion all
 
04:09:29.090 --> 04:09:29.100 align:start position:0%
right and therefore because right now
 
04:09:31.309 --> 04:09:31.319 align:start position:0%
all we do is we say to the Secretary of
 
04:09:33.410 --> 04:09:33.420 align:start position:0%
State or the moderator or the assistant
 
04:09:35.750 --> 04:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State use your judgment
 
04:09:38.269 --> 04:09:38.279 align:start position:0%
right and or the you know the the about
 
04:09:41.750 --> 04:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
law commission use your judgment but I
 
04:09:45.290 --> 04:09:45.300 align:start position:0%
think we could decide on judgment for
 
04:09:47.870 --> 04:09:47.880 align:start position:0%
common cases like this one
 
04:09:51.050 --> 04:09:51.060 align:start position:0%
so so that's what this bill does so this
 
04:09:55.370 --> 04:09:55.380 align:start position:0%
bill picks lists a bunch of cases that
 
04:09:57.950 --> 04:09:57.960 align:start position:0%
I've actually seen on ballots and you
 
04:09:59.689 --> 04:09:59.699 align:start position:0%
could certainly I'd be perfectly happy
 
04:10:01.910 --> 04:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
if you added other cases that you you
 
04:10:05.090 --> 04:10:05.100 align:start position:0%
know of or you changed you know cases
 
04:10:08.210 --> 04:10:08.220 align:start position:0%
that I've put on but it goes through and
 
04:10:10.790 --> 04:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
says well in this case do this and in
 
04:10:13.189 --> 04:10:13.199 align:start position:0%
this case do that and so on and if this
 
04:10:17.090 --> 04:10:17.100 align:start position:0%
became law then then ballots would be in
 
04:10:18.889 --> 04:10:18.899 align:start position:0%
recounts I mean this only really affects
 
04:10:20.269 --> 04:10:20.279 align:start position:0%
recounts it has nothing to do with
 
04:10:24.290 --> 04:10:24.300 align:start position:0%
machine voting but it's in recounts
 
04:10:26.689 --> 04:10:26.699 align:start position:0%
um we would do something consistently
 
04:10:28.849 --> 04:10:28.859 align:start position:0%
from one recount to the next which I
 
04:10:31.010 --> 04:10:31.020 align:start position:0%
think would be Advanced an advantage so
 
04:10:32.809 --> 04:10:32.819 align:start position:0%
what is the bill list well that's the
 
04:10:34.250 --> 04:10:34.260 align:start position:0%
right hand column
 
04:10:37.670 --> 04:10:37.680 align:start position:0%
so the bill basically says if everything
 
04:10:41.510 --> 04:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
on the ballot is consistent except for
 
04:10:45.889 --> 04:10:45.899 align:start position:0%
one spot or possibly two spots then the
 
04:10:48.950 --> 04:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
bill applies right so if somebody votes
 
04:10:52.250 --> 04:10:52.260 align:start position:0%
their whole ballot by doing slashes or
 
04:10:54.710 --> 04:10:54.720 align:start position:0%
check marks or plus signs or whatever
 
04:10:57.469 --> 04:10:57.479 align:start position:0%
they do if they do it consistently over
 
04:10:59.630 --> 04:10:59.640 align:start position:0%
their whole ballot that's fine there's
 
04:11:03.050 --> 04:11:03.060 align:start position:0%
no question about that it's only when
 
04:11:05.929 --> 04:11:05.939 align:start position:0%
one particular spot or possibly two
 
04:11:08.210 --> 04:11:08.220 align:start position:0%
spots is different than the rest of the
 
04:11:11.150 --> 04:11:11.160 align:start position:0%
ballot then this bill the the actions of
 
04:11:12.889 --> 04:11:12.899 align:start position:0%
this bill applies so what are things
 
04:11:14.809 --> 04:11:14.819 align:start position:0%
that could be different well in this
 
04:11:17.090 --> 04:11:17.100 align:start position:0%
case the person crossed off the name
 
04:11:19.610 --> 04:11:19.620 align:start position:0%
they voted but then they crossed off the
 
04:11:22.010 --> 04:11:22.020 align:start position:0%
name so according to the bill that would
 
04:11:23.750 --> 04:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
be not a vote
 
04:11:27.229 --> 04:11:27.239 align:start position:0%
in the second one the person would have
 
04:11:29.269 --> 04:11:29.279 align:start position:0%
had an overvote but they did something
 
04:11:32.630 --> 04:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
weird on one of them and so the one
 
04:11:34.849 --> 04:11:34.859 align:start position:0%
that's weird is not a vote right so
 
04:11:36.769 --> 04:11:36.779 align:start position:0%
therefore this would not be an over this
 
04:11:39.530 --> 04:11:39.540 align:start position:0%
would be a vote for O Jones okay
 
04:11:42.110 --> 04:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
in the third one they put a little dot
 
04:11:44.090 --> 04:11:44.100 align:start position:0%
in the middle of their Circle so what
 
04:11:46.130 --> 04:11:46.140 align:start position:0%
you find when you look at ballots is
 
04:11:48.950 --> 04:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes people like touch their pen to
 
04:11:51.349 --> 04:11:51.359 align:start position:0%
all the spots and then decide to fill in
 
04:11:53.570 --> 04:11:53.580 align:start position:0%
right so just touching your pen in a
 
04:11:55.550 --> 04:11:55.560 align:start position:0%
little dot when that's inconsistent with
 
04:11:57.469 --> 04:11:57.479 align:start position:0%
the rest of the ballot that would not be
 
04:11:58.550 --> 04:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
a vote
 
04:12:00.830 --> 04:12:00.840 align:start position:0%
the fourth one is very common people
 
04:12:04.070 --> 04:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
cross off votes and and vote elsewhere
 
04:12:07.490 --> 04:12:07.500 align:start position:0%
so a cross-off this is not a vote this
 
04:12:09.769 --> 04:12:09.779 align:start position:0%
is commonly done today
 
04:12:12.410 --> 04:12:12.420 align:start position:0%
um common practice the fifth one is the
 
04:12:14.330 --> 04:12:14.340 align:start position:0%
one we talked about I would say that's
 
04:12:17.750 --> 04:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
not a vote uh the sixth one
 
04:12:20.870 --> 04:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
this one I saw once
 
04:12:23.090 --> 04:12:23.100 align:start position:0%
um it's a very weird one because they
 
04:12:24.950 --> 04:12:24.960 align:start position:0%
they essentially decorated this
 
04:12:27.530 --> 04:12:27.540 align:start position:0%
particular vote right so so I interpret
 
04:12:29.929 --> 04:12:29.939 align:start position:0%
this as they really like this one right
 
04:12:32.389 --> 04:12:32.399 align:start position:0%
you know this is this is a really good
 
04:12:35.389 --> 04:12:35.399 align:start position:0%
one so so that one would be a vote and
 
04:12:37.729 --> 04:12:37.739 align:start position:0%
and the seventh one is a write-in where
 
04:12:40.790 --> 04:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
they forgot to fill in the circle so as
 
04:12:42.349 --> 04:12:42.359 align:start position:0%
long as that doesn't create an overvote
 
04:12:44.570 --> 04:12:44.580 align:start position:0%
I would say go ahead with the write-in
 
04:12:47.630 --> 04:12:47.640 align:start position:0%
all right and that's what this bill does
 
04:12:50.330 --> 04:12:50.340 align:start position:0%
okay questions and they're I'm sure you
 
04:12:51.469 --> 04:12:51.479 align:start position:0%
know anything about election law we get
 
04:12:52.670 --> 04:12:52.680 align:start position:0%
into this sort of stuff there's a lot of
 
04:12:55.189 --> 04:12:55.199 align:start position:0%
questions uh representative O'Brien
 
04:12:57.769 --> 04:12:57.779 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you to chairman
 
04:13:00.830 --> 04:13:00.840 align:start position:0%
I like to go to uh the number six for S
 
04:13:03.410 --> 04:13:03.420 align:start position:0%
Jones the one you I think it looks like
 
04:13:04.689 --> 04:13:04.699 align:start position:0%
a spider
 
04:13:09.170 --> 04:13:09.180 align:start position:0%
but you say that you think it means they
 
04:13:11.210 --> 04:13:11.220 align:start position:0%
really like the person but couldn't it
 
04:13:13.330 --> 04:13:13.340 align:start position:0%
also be interpreted as they really
 
04:13:15.590 --> 04:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
changed their mind because they might
 
04:13:17.269 --> 04:13:17.279 align:start position:0%
have filled in the oval and then started
 
04:13:21.309 --> 04:13:21.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:24.710 --> 04:13:24.720 align:start position:0%
absolutely right you could decide to say
 
04:13:27.349 --> 04:13:27.359 align:start position:0%
no to that one and I would be that would
 
04:13:29.389 --> 04:13:29.399 align:start position:0%
be fine with me right I I'm only
 
04:13:32.330 --> 04:13:32.340 align:start position:0%
interested in consistency but in this
 
04:13:34.309 --> 04:13:34.319 align:start position:0%
particular case and in the ballot I saw
 
04:13:37.130 --> 04:13:37.140 align:start position:0%
they did not vote for anyone else
 
04:13:39.349 --> 04:13:39.359 align:start position:0%
right so it's a little different from
 
04:13:43.070 --> 04:13:43.080 align:start position:0%
number four because they made it into a
 
04:13:45.050 --> 04:13:45.060 align:start position:0%
sun or something right they made it into
 
04:13:47.809 --> 04:13:47.819 align:start position:0%
what to me looks like you know extra
 
04:13:50.150 --> 04:13:50.160 align:start position:0%
like but you know to you it could be a
 
04:13:53.870 --> 04:13:53.880 align:start position:0%
CrossFit that's fine you know it it it's
 
04:13:55.849 --> 04:13:55.859 align:start position:0%
all judgment
 
04:13:58.250 --> 04:13:58.260 align:start position:0%
representative Baum
 
04:14:01.969 --> 04:14:01.979 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman now in in our town
 
04:14:04.309 --> 04:14:04.319 align:start position:0%
when I've told a lot of Voters if you
 
04:14:06.410 --> 04:14:06.420 align:start position:0%
make a mistake on the ballot ask for
 
04:14:10.030 --> 04:14:10.040 align:start position:0%
another one so why wouldn't people
 
04:14:12.590 --> 04:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
04:14:14.809 --> 04:14:14.819 align:start position:0%
messing things up just ask for another
 
04:14:16.429 --> 04:14:16.439 align:start position:0%
battle yes thank you for the question
 
04:14:19.429 --> 04:14:19.439 align:start position:0%
and I agree with you absolutely and if
 
04:14:22.610 --> 04:14:22.620 align:start position:0%
you look at line 14
 
04:14:25.309 --> 04:14:25.319 align:start position:0%
um of the bill on the I guess the first
 
04:14:27.170 --> 04:14:27.180 align:start position:0%
first page
 
04:14:27.180 --> 04:14:27.950 align:start position:0%
first page
um

04:14:27.950 --> 04:14:27.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:31.189 --> 04:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
I actually add that to the instructions
 
04:14:33.650 --> 04:14:33.660 align:start position:0%
specifically the current instructions
 
04:14:37.910 --> 04:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
don't say that and and uh so I say if
 
04:14:40.010 --> 04:14:40.020 align:start position:0%
you incorrectly Mark your ballot you may
 
04:14:41.750 --> 04:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
request a new ballot from the moderator
 
04:14:44.389 --> 04:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
right so I think it's good to add the
 
04:14:46.309 --> 04:14:46.319 align:start position:0%
instructions but obviously these are for
 
04:14:49.309 --> 04:14:49.319 align:start position:0%
cases when they don't bother right so
 
04:14:51.189 --> 04:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions
 
04:14:53.870 --> 04:14:53.880 align:start position:0%
representative Grill
 
04:14:55.429 --> 04:14:55.439 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thanks for taking
 
04:14:56.990 --> 04:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
my question
 
04:14:59.269 --> 04:14:59.279 align:start position:0%
um in terms of who would be
 
04:15:01.490 --> 04:15:01.500 align:start position:0%
um responsible for making a judgment I
 
04:15:03.290 --> 04:15:03.300 align:start position:0%
know at the end of election night um
 
04:15:06.410 --> 04:15:06.420 align:start position:0%
there's the hand count process so um
 
04:15:08.689 --> 04:15:08.699 align:start position:0%
so far we've discussed more when you
 
04:15:09.710 --> 04:15:09.720 align:start position:0%
know during your recount when the
 
04:15:11.030 --> 04:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
secretary of state is making a judgment
 
04:15:14.689 --> 04:15:14.699 align:start position:0%
but would a moderator or um town clerk
 
04:15:17.570 --> 04:15:17.580 align:start position:0%
also follow this bill in terms of making
 
04:15:20.929 --> 04:15:20.939 align:start position:0%
those calls the answer is yes it's to be
 
04:15:22.969 --> 04:15:22.979 align:start position:0%
consistent across the whole state yes
 
04:15:24.550 --> 04:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions
 
04:15:27.410 --> 04:15:27.420 align:start position:0%
representative Howard thank you Mr chair
 
04:15:29.210 --> 04:15:29.220 align:start position:0%
and uh thank you for sharing your
 
04:15:33.290 --> 04:15:33.300 align:start position:0%
testimony today I I wanted to ask how uh
 
04:15:34.910 --> 04:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
what are the shortcomings in the ballot
 
04:15:37.670 --> 04:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
law commissions decisions on any of
 
04:15:40.969 --> 04:15:40.979 align:start position:0%
these markings on the on the ballot
 
04:15:42.290 --> 04:15:42.300 align:start position:0%
um well thank you for the question I
 
04:15:45.590 --> 04:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
don't know specifically about ballot law
 
04:15:47.870 --> 04:15:47.880 align:start position:0%
commission decisions
 
04:15:50.150 --> 04:15:50.160 align:start position:0%
um I know about the one case I told you
 
04:15:52.370 --> 04:15:52.380 align:start position:0%
about this one on the left was the
 
04:15:55.550 --> 04:15:55.560 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's decision now I I
 
04:15:57.170 --> 04:15:57.180 align:start position:0%
don't think that in that particular
 
04:15:57.180 --> 04:15:58.550 align:start position:0%
don't think that in that particular
election

04:15:58.550 --> 04:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
election
 
04:16:02.210 --> 04:16:02.220 align:start position:0%
after the recount I don't think it went
 
04:16:03.590 --> 04:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
to the ballot law commission I think
 
04:16:05.269 --> 04:16:05.279 align:start position:0%
there was enough votes one way or the
 
04:16:07.790 --> 04:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
other that it was dispositive you know
 
04:16:09.349 --> 04:16:09.359 align:start position:0%
what I mean so
 
04:16:12.050 --> 04:16:12.060 align:start position:0%
um so you know I can't really answer but
 
04:16:14.510 --> 04:16:14.520 align:start position:0%
but like I said specifically the
 
04:16:16.849 --> 04:16:16.859 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State made a decision that
 
04:16:18.889 --> 04:16:18.899 align:start position:0%
I would have made personally would have
 
04:16:20.990 --> 04:16:21.000 align:start position:0%
made the opposite decision so that's the
 
04:16:21.000 --> 04:16:22.910 align:start position:0%
made the opposite decision so that's the
basis

04:16:22.910 --> 04:16:22.920 align:start position:0%
basis
 
04:16:25.910 --> 04:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
further questions representative Lane
 
04:16:27.650 --> 04:16:27.660 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:16:27.660 --> 04:16:28.429 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

04:16:28.429 --> 04:16:28.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:16:31.910 --> 04:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
I have done recounts and I have so and
 
04:16:34.550 --> 04:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
you're right you see everything so so
 
04:16:37.370 --> 04:16:37.380 align:start position:0%
what if this isn't everything and it
 
04:16:39.290 --> 04:16:39.300 align:start position:0%
does your the bill doesn't seem to
 
04:16:41.809 --> 04:16:41.819 align:start position:0%
address that so it would be up to the
 
04:16:43.849 --> 04:16:43.859 align:start position:0%
discretion of the election officer to
 
04:16:46.130 --> 04:16:46.140 align:start position:0%
make it in that instance yes thank you
 
04:16:47.450 --> 04:16:47.460 align:start position:0%
for the question yes it would default
 
04:16:50.410 --> 04:16:50.420 align:start position:0%
back to if it's not one of these things
 
04:16:52.849 --> 04:16:52.859 align:start position:0%
discussed it would default back to the
 
04:16:54.710 --> 04:16:54.720 align:start position:0%
moderator or the Secretary of State or
 
04:16:57.950 --> 04:16:57.960 align:start position:0%
whatever no yes but if you can think of
 
04:17:00.349 --> 04:17:00.359 align:start position:0%
others you know I'd be happy for you to
 
04:17:01.729 --> 04:17:01.739 align:start position:0%
add them
 
04:17:03.830 --> 04:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
just it's just led me to make all of a
 
04:17:03.840 --> 04:17:05.510 align:start position:0%
just it's just led me to make all of a
decision

04:17:05.510 --> 04:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
decision
 
04:17:07.610 --> 04:17:07.620 align:start position:0%
further I get a follow-up I was just a
 
04:17:09.469 --> 04:17:09.479 align:start position:0%
fall it's not really a question but
 
04:17:11.510 --> 04:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
um every time you do that you always
 
04:17:13.849 --> 04:17:13.859 align:start position:0%
leave one out at least that's been my
 
04:17:15.950 --> 04:17:15.960 align:start position:0%
experience yeah I'm not claiming these
 
04:17:19.969 --> 04:17:19.979 align:start position:0%
are exhaustive it's it's the Royal you
 
04:17:21.469 --> 04:17:21.479 align:start position:0%
um further questions representative
 
04:17:21.479 --> 04:17:24.410 align:start position:0%
um further questions representative
Muirhead

04:17:24.410 --> 04:17:24.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:27.469 --> 04:17:27.479 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
04:17:29.750 --> 04:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
so first uh
 
04:17:32.330 --> 04:17:32.340 align:start position:0%
if if a voter puts a little dot in the
 
04:17:34.189 --> 04:17:34.199 align:start position:0%
middle of the oval every time they vote
 
04:17:35.990 --> 04:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
for candidate they'll vote for too many
 
04:17:38.150 --> 04:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
then then all those little dots could
 
04:17:39.889 --> 04:17:39.899 align:start position:0%
counter if they just trace the outline
 
04:17:41.809 --> 04:17:41.819 align:start position:0%
of the oval those things okay so because
 
04:17:46.610 --> 04:17:46.620 align:start position:0%
two to to be takes precedence over 2C as
 
04:17:48.950 --> 04:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
it does logically okay yes do you just
 
04:17:51.469 --> 04:17:51.479 align:start position:0%
happen to know how how an election how
 
04:17:54.410 --> 04:17:54.420 align:start position:0%
those uh Optical readers see things like
 
04:17:55.550 --> 04:17:55.560 align:start position:0%
the little dot in the middle of the
 
04:17:57.769 --> 04:17:57.779 align:start position:0%
circle or the outline of the outsider
 
04:17:59.929 --> 04:17:59.939 align:start position:0%
they count those as votes
 
04:18:02.269 --> 04:18:02.279 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question
 
04:18:02.279 --> 04:18:03.410 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question
um

04:18:03.410 --> 04:18:03.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:18:06.590 --> 04:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
I don't know for sure but I would I
 
04:18:09.530 --> 04:18:09.540 align:start position:0%
would assume that on let's say my H
 
04:18:12.530 --> 04:18:12.540 align:start position:0%
Jones case the optical reader might read
 
04:18:14.210 --> 04:18:14.220 align:start position:0%
that as a blank right it might not have
 
04:18:16.570 --> 04:18:16.580 align:start position:0%
I would assume they they look for some
 
04:18:20.389 --> 04:18:20.399 align:start position:0%
some amount of dark right and and they
 
04:18:23.330 --> 04:18:23.340 align:start position:0%
they have a threshold right of if it's
 
04:18:25.010 --> 04:18:25.020 align:start position:0%
some more than this and less than that
 
04:18:27.170 --> 04:18:27.180 align:start position:0%
and maybe they look at all the spots and
 
04:18:29.269 --> 04:18:29.279 align:start position:0%
say Well they're all light therefore I
 
04:18:31.729 --> 04:18:31.739 align:start position:0%
move my threshold down and you know I
 
04:18:33.229 --> 04:18:33.239 align:start position:0%
mean if I were writing the software that
 
04:18:35.090 --> 04:18:35.100 align:start position:0%
might be how I would do it right and if
 
04:18:36.769 --> 04:18:36.779 align:start position:0%
they're all very dark I'll move my
 
04:18:39.889 --> 04:18:39.899 align:start position:0%
threshold up right so so uh I can't
 
04:18:43.130 --> 04:18:43.140 align:start position:0%
answer the question specifically but
 
04:18:45.349 --> 04:18:45.359 align:start position:0%
uh you follow
 
04:18:47.030 --> 04:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
I I'm tempted to ask a follow-up
 
04:18:49.429 --> 04:18:49.439 align:start position:0%
question just do it just do it you know
 
04:18:51.530 --> 04:18:51.540 align:start position:0%
why not we have we have another we have
 
04:18:53.210 --> 04:18:53.220 align:start position:0%
another 13 minutes till the next one so
 
04:18:55.430 --> 04:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
I mean do you know how chat GPT would
 
04:18:55.440 --> 04:18:58.070 align:start position:0%
I mean do you know how chat GPT would
[Laughter]

04:18:58.070 --> 04:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
04:19:00.050 --> 04:19:00.060 align:start position:0%
does it have a camera input or something
 
04:19:03.170 --> 04:19:03.180 align:start position:0%
it can
 
04:19:05.210 --> 04:19:05.220 align:start position:0%
uh okay any other questions
 
04:19:07.490 --> 04:19:07.500 align:start position:0%

04:19:54.110 --> 04:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
so close don't worry unless you guys tie
 
04:19:56.389 --> 04:19:56.399 align:start position:0%
up the deputy secretary um we're still
 
04:19:59.030 --> 04:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
gonna have some time sorry Aaron
 
04:20:00.769 --> 04:20:00.779 align:start position:0%
Hennessy deputy Deputy Terry State thank
 
04:20:03.469 --> 04:20:03.479 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman for my late remark I
 
04:20:05.269 --> 04:20:05.279 align:start position:0%
just want to point out one thing in this
 
04:20:06.469 --> 04:20:06.479 align:start position:0%
legislation and it goes to
 
04:20:08.510 --> 04:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
representative Lane's question about
 
04:20:11.389 --> 04:20:11.399 align:start position:0%
what if some an oval is not filled in
 
04:20:12.950 --> 04:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
according to the examples that are
 
04:20:15.290 --> 04:20:15.300 align:start position:0%
provided in the legislation and on lines
 
04:20:20.030 --> 04:20:20.040 align:start position:0%
25 and 26 it says shall determine and
 
04:20:22.070 --> 04:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
then blah blah blah as follows so it
 
04:20:24.229 --> 04:20:24.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't it doesn't account for anything
 
04:20:26.750 --> 04:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
other than what's one of the examples
 
04:20:29.030 --> 04:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
given here so
 
04:20:31.309 --> 04:20:31.319 align:start position:0%
um my concern is is that if somebody's
 
04:20:34.370 --> 04:20:34.380 align:start position:0%
pen is running out of ink and in the
 
04:20:36.229 --> 04:20:36.239 align:start position:0%
last two ovals there's just a little bit
 
04:20:38.689 --> 04:20:38.699 align:start position:0%
of a dot in each left those would not be
 
04:20:40.250 --> 04:20:40.260 align:start position:0%
counted as a vote because they don't
 
04:20:40.260 --> 04:20:41.210 align:start position:0%
counted as a vote because they don't
follow

04:20:41.210 --> 04:20:41.220 align:start position:0%
follow
 
04:20:43.849 --> 04:20:43.859 align:start position:0%
what's here but when you look at the
 
04:20:45.410 --> 04:20:45.420 align:start position:0%
ballot as a whole you can see the inks
 
04:20:47.809 --> 04:20:47.819 align:start position:0%
running out which I've seen before
 
04:20:49.429 --> 04:20:49.439 align:start position:0%
um but that doesn't fit into one of the
 
04:20:51.769 --> 04:20:51.779 align:start position:0%
descriptions here and so those votes
 
04:20:53.330 --> 04:20:53.340 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be counted so I just want to
 
04:20:55.610 --> 04:20:55.620 align:start position:0%
say this is not an exhaustive list but
 
04:20:58.729 --> 04:20:58.739 align:start position:0%
the language of the bill says that it
 
04:21:01.969 --> 04:21:01.979 align:start position:0%
shall be counted according to only these
 
04:21:05.229 --> 04:21:05.239 align:start position:0%
examples here okay questions
 
04:21:09.290 --> 04:21:09.300 align:start position:0%
representative wood yes uh then it was
 
04:21:11.030 --> 04:21:11.040 align:start position:0%
said that if we looked at the example
 
04:21:13.429 --> 04:21:13.439 align:start position:0%
the first set of examples H Jones with
 
04:21:16.910 --> 04:21:16.920 align:start position:0%
just a circle outline was selected by
 
04:21:19.670 --> 04:21:19.680 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General as
 
04:21:22.309 --> 04:21:22.319 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State sorry as as a valid
 
04:21:24.050 --> 04:21:24.060 align:start position:0%
vote that's not one of the examples that
 
04:21:26.210 --> 04:21:26.220 align:start position:0%
I've ever seen but can you help me with
 
04:21:28.550 --> 04:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
that sorry I I'm only looking at the
 
04:21:30.469 --> 04:21:30.479 align:start position:0%
legislation I don't have what you have
 
04:21:32.990 --> 04:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
in front of oh I'm sorry can I hand it
 
04:21:35.630 --> 04:21:35.640 align:start position:0%
to her yeah um go for it we got 35
 
04:21:39.050 --> 04:21:39.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:41.750 --> 04:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
Fold It Up make origami do whatever you
 
04:21:50.030 --> 04:21:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:53.330 --> 04:21:53.340 align:start position:0%
the circle yes okay thank you so for H
 
04:21:56.389 --> 04:21:56.399 align:start position:0%
Jones versus G Jones yes I've seen that
 
04:21:56.399 --> 04:22:01.610 align:start position:0%
Jones versus G Jones yes I've seen that
before

04:22:01.610 --> 04:22:01.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:03.590 --> 04:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
I've seen someone do this on a ballot
 
04:22:05.710 --> 04:22:05.720 align:start position:0%
before and that's
 
04:22:08.210 --> 04:22:08.220 align:start position:0%
if they were consistent with it
 
04:22:10.309 --> 04:22:10.319 align:start position:0%
yesterday representative this doesn't
 
04:22:11.809 --> 04:22:11.819 align:start position:0%
even begin to touch which you will see
 
04:22:13.729 --> 04:22:13.739 align:start position:0%
on those ballots
 
04:22:19.790 --> 04:22:19.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:21.349 --> 04:22:21.359 align:start position:0%
question just uh
 
04:22:24.889 --> 04:22:24.899 align:start position:0%
uh would you rather see regulation or
 
04:22:27.349 --> 04:22:27.359 align:start position:0%
guidance from the Secretary of State for
 
04:22:29.990 --> 04:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
these type of examples
 
04:22:31.969 --> 04:22:31.979 align:start position:0%
you have does the Secretary of State's
 
04:22:33.950 --> 04:22:33.960 align:start position:0%
office have a preference
 
04:22:36.710 --> 04:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the good question
 
04:22:38.689 --> 04:22:38.699 align:start position:0%
um I would rather see guidance in the
 
04:22:40.870 --> 04:22:40.880 align:start position:0%
election procedure manual versus
 
04:22:43.550 --> 04:22:43.560 align:start position:0%
stipulation in law just because again
 
04:22:46.130 --> 04:22:46.140 align:start position:0%
you're not going to have an exhaustive
 
04:22:50.689 --> 04:22:50.699 align:start position:0%
list follow yeah so so just like
 
04:22:55.130 --> 04:22:55.140 align:start position:0%
um line 14 on the first page so
 
04:22:57.410 --> 04:22:57.420 align:start position:0%
I think the idea of of
 
04:22:59.330 --> 04:22:59.340 align:start position:0%
regulating the requesting of a new
 
04:23:01.610 --> 04:23:01.620 align:start position:0%
ballot is not a bad
 
04:23:04.070 --> 04:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
thing but
 
04:23:06.830 --> 04:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
but I I take I take it with some of the
 
04:23:09.950 --> 04:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
the other that the guidance would be
 
04:23:14.030 --> 04:23:14.040 align:start position:0%
perhaps preferable and
 
04:23:17.030 --> 04:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure the office the Secretary of
 
04:23:19.429 --> 04:23:19.439 align:start position:0%
State's office would have an even more
 
04:23:21.590 --> 04:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
comprehensive list than the cat and dog
 
04:23:25.070 --> 04:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:27.769 --> 04:23:27.779 align:start position:0%
yes I'm sure if we got everyone around
 
04:23:30.170 --> 04:23:30.180 align:start position:0%
and started chatting we would come up
 
04:23:32.150 --> 04:23:32.160 align:start position:0%
with a really really long list of
 
04:23:32.160 --> 04:23:34.250 align:start position:0%
with a really really long list of
possibilities

04:23:34.250 --> 04:23:34.260 align:start position:0%
possibilities
 
04:23:37.210 --> 04:23:37.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:40.070 --> 04:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
question sorry yeah Mike was off Mike
 
04:23:43.370 --> 04:23:43.380 align:start position:0%
was on representative Lane thank you
 
04:23:43.380 --> 04:23:48.650 align:start position:0%
was on representative Lane thank you
so

04:23:48.650 --> 04:23:48.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:51.590 --> 04:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
ask that you provide guidance because I
 
04:23:53.510 --> 04:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
know and I don't remember which other
 
04:23:56.210 --> 04:23:56.220 align:start position:0%
bill it was but
 
04:23:58.910 --> 04:23:58.920 align:start position:0%
um secretary Scanlon seemed to think he
 
04:24:01.969 --> 04:24:01.979 align:start position:0%
needed some kind of authority to make
 
04:24:04.729 --> 04:24:04.739 align:start position:0%
those regulations so would that be
 
04:24:06.410 --> 04:24:06.420 align:start position:0%
something you think you would need
 
04:24:10.610 --> 04:24:10.620 align:start position:0%
rather than itemize them out or not so
 
04:24:12.530 --> 04:24:12.540 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um no we
 
04:24:14.210 --> 04:24:14.220 align:start position:0%
already do provide guidance in our
 
04:24:15.830 --> 04:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
training sessions that we do we go
 
04:24:17.809 --> 04:24:17.819 align:start position:0%
around the state and do trainings before
 
04:24:20.150 --> 04:24:20.160 align:start position:0%
every Statewide election and that's when
 
04:24:22.189 --> 04:24:22.199 align:start position:0%
I first started in this position having
 
04:24:25.070 --> 04:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
no other election law experience
 
04:24:27.889 --> 04:24:27.899 align:start position:0%
um and so that's how I learned about all
 
04:24:30.950 --> 04:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
these different weird anomalies was in
 
04:24:33.290 --> 04:24:33.300 align:start position:0%
the training and how to look at the
 
04:24:35.990 --> 04:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
intent of the voter as a whole
 
04:24:38.870 --> 04:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
where's the Murat thank you does the
 
04:24:40.550 --> 04:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
guidance that we ought that your office
 
04:24:43.010 --> 04:24:43.020 align:start position:0%
offers align with the guidance that's in
 
04:24:45.290 --> 04:24:45.300 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:24:48.590 --> 04:24:48.600 align:start position:0%
uh I would say in general yes
 
04:24:50.269 --> 04:24:50.279 align:start position:0%
um I I can't say specifically I don't
 
04:24:53.510 --> 04:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
have it in front of me but the intent of
 
04:24:55.010 --> 04:24:55.020 align:start position:0%
when you look at someone how someone's
 
04:24:57.349 --> 04:24:57.359 align:start position:0%
voting is always to look at what the
 
04:25:00.650 --> 04:25:00.660 align:start position:0%
intent of the voter was so if they
 
04:25:02.090 --> 04:25:02.100 align:start position:0%
I mean you will see a lot of different
 
04:25:04.189 --> 04:25:04.199 align:start position:0%
stuff but if they've crossed out a name
 
04:25:07.070 --> 04:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
and wrote definitely not ever you know
 
04:25:09.349 --> 04:25:09.359 align:start position:0%
that representative Muirhead is familiar
 
04:25:11.030 --> 04:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
with those on the ballots that he looks
 
04:25:13.849 --> 04:25:13.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:13.859 --> 04:25:15.349 align:start position:0%
 
uh

04:25:15.349 --> 04:25:15.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:25:17.990 --> 04:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
I can I can get the committee what's in
 
04:25:19.550 --> 04:25:19.560 align:start position:0%
the election
 
04:25:20.929 --> 04:25:20.939 align:start position:0%
procedure oh you have the election
 
04:25:23.809 --> 04:25:23.819 align:start position:0%
procedure manual but we go in beyond
 
04:25:25.610 --> 04:25:25.620 align:start position:0%
what the procedure manual has in our
 
04:25:28.370 --> 04:25:28.380 align:start position:0%
trainings we go into things like this
 
04:25:30.170 --> 04:25:30.180 align:start position:0%
um in-person trainings
 
04:25:31.969 --> 04:25:31.979 align:start position:0%
representative Brennan
 
04:25:33.410 --> 04:25:33.420 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
04:25:36.349 --> 04:25:36.359 align:start position:0%
question if this bill were to be amended
 
04:25:39.070 --> 04:25:39.080 align:start position:0%
to keep the
 
04:25:42.170 --> 04:25:42.180 align:start position:0%
line 1415 where it says if you
 
04:25:43.849 --> 04:25:43.859 align:start position:0%
incorrectly Mark your ballot you may
 
04:25:45.530 --> 04:25:45.540 align:start position:0%
request a new ballot from the moderator
 
04:25:47.149 --> 04:25:47.159 align:start position:0%
so that that was part of the
 
04:25:50.349 --> 04:25:50.359 align:start position:0%
instructions on the ballot and then
 
04:25:53.330 --> 04:25:53.340 align:start position:0%
simply added that
 
04:25:53.340 --> 04:25:54.050 align:start position:0%
simply added that
[Music]

04:25:54.050 --> 04:25:54.060 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:25:54.060 --> 04:25:54.889 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

04:25:54.889 --> 04:25:54.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:57.469 --> 04:25:57.479 align:start position:0%
the that the Secretary of State's office
 
04:26:01.130 --> 04:26:01.140 align:start position:0%
must provide specific guidance
 
04:26:05.510 --> 04:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
on interpreting uh ballot marks
 
04:26:08.210 --> 04:26:08.220 align:start position:0%
as part of the required part of the
 
04:26:11.090 --> 04:26:11.100 align:start position:0%
training is that something that would
 
04:26:13.729 --> 04:26:13.739 align:start position:0%
sufficiently address this issue
 
04:26:13.739 --> 04:26:15.469 align:start position:0%
sufficiently address this issue
appropriately

04:26:15.469 --> 04:26:15.479 align:start position:0%
appropriately
 
04:26:17.149 --> 04:26:17.159 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I can't speak
 
04:26:19.849 --> 04:26:19.859 align:start position:0%
to the sponsors response to that but I
 
04:26:22.849 --> 04:26:22.859 align:start position:0%
think that since we do do that in our
 
04:26:24.889 --> 04:26:24.899 align:start position:0%
trainings we we would be
 
04:26:26.269 --> 04:26:26.279 align:start position:0%
happy with
 
04:26:28.370 --> 04:26:28.380 align:start position:0%
that requirement
 
04:26:30.050 --> 04:26:30.060 align:start position:0%
fair enough further questions
 
04:26:32.570 --> 04:26:32.580 align:start position:0%
representative weary
 
04:26:34.550 --> 04:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
04:26:39.649 --> 04:26:39.659 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:41.750 --> 04:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
I I guess you know there can be a
 
04:26:43.790 --> 04:26:43.800 align:start position:0%
difference between guidance or
 
04:26:46.969 --> 04:26:46.979 align:start position:0%
guidelines and training training can go
 
04:26:49.250 --> 04:26:49.260 align:start position:0%
and I'm thinking
 
04:26:51.769 --> 04:26:51.779 align:start position:0%
I don't want to misinterpret what the
 
04:26:54.830 --> 04:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
sponsor wants but it appears that they
 
04:26:58.790 --> 04:26:58.800 align:start position:0%
want some kind of more detailed
 
04:27:01.250 --> 04:27:01.260 align:start position:0%
um thing so is it possible to provide
 
04:27:01.260 --> 04:27:02.330 align:start position:0%
um thing so is it possible to provide
that

04:27:02.330 --> 04:27:02.340 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:27:06.530 --> 04:27:06.540 align:start position:0%
more detailed guidance within the manual
 
04:27:08.929 --> 04:27:08.939 align:start position:0%
or the materials Beyond just the
 
04:27:12.349 --> 04:27:12.359 align:start position:0%
training seminars so that it's codified
 
04:27:14.389 --> 04:27:14.399 align:start position:0%
in some way but not at the regulatory
 
04:27:14.399 --> 04:27:16.729 align:start position:0%
in some way but not at the regulatory
level

04:27:16.729 --> 04:27:16.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:18.469 --> 04:27:18.479 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:27:18.479 --> 04:27:19.309 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
um

04:27:19.309 --> 04:27:19.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:27:21.590 --> 04:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
so this
 
04:27:21.600 --> 04:27:23.750 align:start position:0%
so this
um

04:27:23.750 --> 04:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:25.429 --> 04:27:25.439 align:start position:0%
and again I just got up to talk about
 
04:27:30.290 --> 04:27:30.300 align:start position:0%
the shall part or the um as follows but
 
04:27:31.849 --> 04:27:31.859 align:start position:0%
um you made a mistake I think the
 
04:27:34.370 --> 04:27:34.380 align:start position:0%
difference between what the and I can't
 
04:27:36.950 --> 04:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
speak to these sponsors intent but the
 
04:27:38.929 --> 04:27:38.939 align:start position:0%
way this is written it's election
 
04:27:43.130 --> 04:27:43.140 align:start position:0%
officials shall do this in our office we
 
04:27:45.889 --> 04:27:45.899 align:start position:0%
provide training we provide forms and
 
04:27:48.290 --> 04:27:48.300 align:start position:0%
guidance we put in an election that we
 
04:27:50.389 --> 04:27:50.399 align:start position:0%
put it in the manual we put it in online
 
04:27:52.189 --> 04:27:52.199 align:start position:0%
training we put it in person training
 
04:27:55.309 --> 04:27:55.319 align:start position:0%
but we can't require election officials
 
04:27:56.990 --> 04:27:57.000 align:start position:0%
to do something
 
04:27:57.000 --> 04:28:00.590 align:start position:0%
to do something
so

04:28:00.590 --> 04:28:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:02.090 --> 04:28:02.100 align:start position:0%
for the questions
 
04:28:05.149 --> 04:28:05.159 align:start position:0%
I'll follow up so
 
04:28:05.159 --> 04:28:07.250 align:start position:0%
I'll follow up so
um

04:28:07.250 --> 04:28:07.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:28:10.610 --> 04:28:10.620 align:start position:0%
so do we so kind of teasing that out a
 
04:28:12.290 --> 04:28:12.300 align:start position:0%
little bit then do we need to clarify
 
04:28:13.670 --> 04:28:13.680 align:start position:0%
the language to say that election
 
04:28:16.330 --> 04:28:16.340 align:start position:0%
officers will follow the guidance
 
04:28:18.889 --> 04:28:18.899 align:start position:0%
provided by the Secretary of State's
 
04:28:20.870 --> 04:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
office on this matter
 
04:28:25.030 --> 04:28:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:27.950 --> 04:28:27.960 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that yeah I'd have to I
 
04:28:29.450 --> 04:28:29.460 align:start position:0%
think that's more of a legal question
 
04:28:31.969 --> 04:28:31.979 align:start position:0%
the Lord uh representative prude home
 
04:28:35.210 --> 04:28:35.220 align:start position:0%
O'Brien thank you Mr chairman
 
04:28:36.910 --> 04:28:36.920 align:start position:0%
I've seen
 
04:28:39.649 --> 04:28:39.659 align:start position:0%
ballots that are filled out during a
 
04:28:42.290 --> 04:28:42.300 align:start position:0%
recap when I was working a recount
 
04:28:44.149 --> 04:28:44.159 align:start position:0%
and I remember
 
04:28:46.429 --> 04:28:46.439 align:start position:0%
voting myself
 
04:28:48.410 --> 04:28:48.420 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong but aren't there
 
04:28:52.750 --> 04:28:52.760 align:start position:0%
instructions on the table that tell you
 
04:28:57.349 --> 04:28:57.359 align:start position:0%
how to fill out the oval when you're
 
04:29:01.030 --> 04:29:01.040 align:start position:0%
voting they're right there
 
04:29:05.090 --> 04:29:05.100 align:start position:0%
so the voter can see that and would you
 
04:29:05.100 --> 04:29:06.349 align:start position:0%
so the voter can see that and would you
agree

04:29:06.349 --> 04:29:06.359 align:start position:0%
agree
 
04:29:08.870 --> 04:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
with what I observed and that is that
 
04:29:12.110 --> 04:29:12.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire voters are pretty good
 
04:29:15.110 --> 04:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
I I don't I find these to be in a vast
 
04:29:18.710 --> 04:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
minority stuff like this and what you
 
04:29:21.110 --> 04:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
know what you're talking about thank you
 
04:29:22.910 --> 04:29:22.920 align:start position:0%
for the question without statistically
 
04:29:24.530 --> 04:29:24.540 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
04:29:26.750 --> 04:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
our ballots I would definitely agree
 
04:29:28.130 --> 04:29:28.140 align:start position:0%
with you from the recounts that I've
 
04:29:30.769 --> 04:29:30.779 align:start position:0%
seen that it's this paper is
 
04:29:32.870 --> 04:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
um not the norm of Voters
 
04:29:34.910 --> 04:29:34.920 align:start position:0%
and that there are instructions in the
 
04:29:36.229 --> 04:29:36.239 align:start position:0%
ballot booth and I believe those
 
04:29:38.689 --> 04:29:38.699 align:start position:0%
instructions also say you can get if you
 
04:29:41.030 --> 04:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
make a mistake you can get a new ballot
 
04:29:43.490 --> 04:29:43.500 align:start position:0%
yes oh sorry he's saying you can get up
 
04:29:47.450 --> 04:29:47.460 align:start position:0%
to three ballots yeah yes
 
04:29:50.990 --> 04:29:51.000 align:start position:0%
further questions for the definition of
 
04:29:51.000 --> 04:29:52.550 align:start position:0%
further questions for the definition of
shall

04:29:52.550 --> 04:29:52.560 align:start position:0%
shall
 
04:29:52.560 --> 04:29:54.110 align:start position:0%
shall
okay

04:29:54.110 --> 04:29:54.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:29:59.050 --> 04:29:59.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:01.670 --> 04:30:01.680 align:start position:0%
you know the answer to that
 
04:30:01.680 --> 04:30:05.030 align:start position:0%
you know the answer to that
um

04:30:05.030 --> 04:30:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:07.250 --> 04:30:07.260 align:start position:0%
on the blue sheet we have
 
04:30:07.260 --> 04:30:07.969 align:start position:0%
on the blue sheet we have
um

04:30:07.969 --> 04:30:07.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:30:11.630 --> 04:30:11.640 align:start position:0%
three people signed up uh not testifying
 
04:30:13.490 --> 04:30:13.500 align:start position:0%
all of which were opposed and with that
 
04:30:17.870 --> 04:30:17.880 align:start position:0%
I will close the hearing on HB 495 we
 
04:30:20.929 --> 04:30:20.939 align:start position:0%
will reconvene at three o'clock
 
04:30:23.229 --> 04:30:23.239 align:start position:0%
um for our final bill of the day which
 
05:01:08.868 --> 05:01:08.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:12.770 --> 05:01:12.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:16.070 --> 05:01:16.080 align:start position:0%
all right here you hear you
 
05:01:19.190 --> 05:01:19.200 align:start position:0%
um going to I'm gonna I'm gonna open up
 
05:01:21.770 --> 05:01:21.780 align:start position:0%
the house election law committee on
 
05:01:26.810 --> 05:01:26.820 align:start position:0%
house bill 460. one two three four five
 
05:01:26.820 --> 05:01:27.470 align:start position:0%
house bill 460. one two three four five
um

05:01:27.470 --> 05:01:27.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:01:30.230 --> 05:01:30.240 align:start position:0%
yeah is the representative Lynn
 
05:01:32.390 --> 05:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
um before we start looks like we're
 
05:01:34.010 --> 05:01:34.020 align:start position:0%
gonna have quite a few pink cards so we
 
05:01:36.590 --> 05:01:36.600 align:start position:0%
can get those down to me real fast
 
05:01:36.600 --> 05:01:37.368 align:start position:0%
can get those down to me real fast
um

05:01:37.368 --> 05:01:37.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:01:43.490 --> 05:01:43.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:46.190 --> 05:01:46.200 align:start position:0%
how dare you
 
05:01:48.050 --> 05:01:48.060 align:start position:0%
um okay so it looks like we have quite a
 
05:01:50.208 --> 05:01:50.218 align:start position:0%
few people sign up to speak on this
 
05:01:54.310 --> 05:01:54.320 align:start position:0%
um so with the um uh ranking members
 
05:01:56.570 --> 05:01:56.580 align:start position:0%
Indulgence I am going to put in a time
 
05:01:58.850 --> 05:01:58.860 align:start position:0%
limit for each speaker not including the
 
05:02:00.590 --> 05:02:00.600 align:start position:0%
primary sponsor it was the own objection
 
05:02:02.570 --> 05:02:02.580 align:start position:0%
of that
 
05:02:04.670 --> 05:02:04.680 align:start position:0%
it depends on how long the primary
 
05:02:08.150 --> 05:02:08.160 align:start position:0%
sponsor is given I think both sides need
 
05:02:11.510 --> 05:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
to be have equal time to be heard okay
 
05:02:12.890 --> 05:02:12.900 align:start position:0%
um if that's the case we'll put in a
 
05:02:14.628 --> 05:02:14.638 align:start position:0%
five minute limit for everyone
 
05:02:16.128 --> 05:02:16.138 align:start position:0%
does that work for you representative
 
05:02:16.138 --> 05:02:17.090 align:start position:0%
does that work for you representative
one

05:02:17.090 --> 05:02:17.100 align:start position:0%
one
 
05:02:19.788 --> 05:02:19.798 align:start position:0%
oh yes absolutely it does and we have a
 
05:02:21.830 --> 05:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
card for you representative way no you
 
05:02:23.690 --> 05:02:23.700 align:start position:0%
don't and I'm I'm filling it out right
 
05:02:23.700 --> 05:02:24.788 align:start position:0%
don't and I'm I'm filling it out right
now

05:02:24.788 --> 05:02:24.798 align:start position:0%
now
 
05:02:31.310 --> 05:02:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:34.490 --> 05:02:34.500 align:start position:0%
and I'll get my clock going here
 
05:02:35.690 --> 05:02:35.700 align:start position:0%
all right
 
05:02:35.700 --> 05:02:36.708 align:start position:0%
all right
um

05:02:36.708 --> 05:02:36.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:02:38.810 --> 05:02:38.820 align:start position:0%
well thank you uh Mr chair members of
 
05:02:40.310 --> 05:02:40.320 align:start position:0%
the committee um
 
05:02:44.030 --> 05:02:44.040 align:start position:0%
actually this this bill
 
05:02:47.390 --> 05:02:47.400 align:start position:0%
I think is relatively simple
 
05:02:51.590 --> 05:02:51.600 align:start position:0%
um and and I'll I think I can explain it
 
05:02:53.628 --> 05:02:53.638 align:start position:0%
fairly simply
 
05:02:57.410 --> 05:02:57.420 align:start position:0%
my intent in drafting this bill
 
05:03:03.110 --> 05:03:03.120 align:start position:0%
was simply to set to to say we want to
 
05:03:03.120 --> 05:03:04.430 align:start position:0%
was simply to set to to say we want to
preserve

05:03:04.430 --> 05:03:04.440 align:start position:0%
preserve
 
05:03:08.110 --> 05:03:08.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire same day registration
 
05:03:10.610 --> 05:03:10.620 align:start position:0%
to allow people to come in and register
 
05:03:12.350 --> 05:03:12.360 align:start position:0%
on the same day that they vote even if
 
05:03:15.170 --> 05:03:15.180 align:start position:0%
they haven't done so earlier we want to
 
05:03:15.180 --> 05:03:16.550 align:start position:0%
they haven't done so earlier we want to
preserve

05:03:16.550 --> 05:03:16.560 align:start position:0%
preserve
 
05:03:18.110 --> 05:03:18.120 align:start position:0%
the sort of
 
05:03:18.120 --> 05:03:20.050 align:start position:0%
the sort of
uh

05:03:20.050 --> 05:03:20.060 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:03:23.030 --> 05:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
pre-same day registration the same as it
 
05:03:24.708 --> 05:03:24.718 align:start position:0%
kind of exists now but the one thing
 
05:03:27.770 --> 05:03:27.780 align:start position:0%
that we want to do away with
 
05:03:27.780 --> 05:03:29.448 align:start position:0%
that we want to do away with
is

05:03:29.448 --> 05:03:29.458 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:03:33.830 --> 05:03:33.840 align:start position:0%
the sort of excuses if you will for not
 
05:03:37.010 --> 05:03:37.020 align:start position:0%
providing the required documentation to
 
05:03:37.020 --> 05:03:37.990 align:start position:0%
providing the required documentation to
prove

05:03:37.990 --> 05:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
prove
 
05:03:41.270 --> 05:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
citizenship domicile age and identity
 
05:03:44.030 --> 05:03:44.040 align:start position:0%
and essentially what this build does is
 
05:03:46.490 --> 05:03:46.500 align:start position:0%
it does away with all that it says you
 
05:03:47.868 --> 05:03:47.878 align:start position:0%
want to come in and register on Election
 
05:03:49.190 --> 05:03:49.200 align:start position:0%
Day great
 
05:03:52.070 --> 05:03:52.080 align:start position:0%
bring the documents if you don't bring
 
05:03:54.530 --> 05:03:54.540 align:start position:0%
the documents you don't vote it's as
 
05:03:57.288 --> 05:03:57.298 align:start position:0%
simple as that and this and obviously on
 
05:03:59.890 --> 05:03:59.900 align:start position:0%
an earlier day if you register before
 
05:04:02.810 --> 05:04:02.820 align:start position:0%
election day then you don't have to
 
05:04:04.788 --> 05:04:04.798 align:start position:0%
prove again on Election Day your
 
05:04:08.208 --> 05:04:08.218 align:start position:0%
citizenship or your domicile
 
05:04:09.770 --> 05:04:09.780 align:start position:0%
um or that kind of thing all you need to
 
05:04:12.230 --> 05:04:12.240 align:start position:0%
prove is your identity on Election Day
 
05:04:15.050 --> 05:04:15.060 align:start position:0%
and that's really that's that's sort of
 
05:04:17.990 --> 05:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
the end of it it's it basically says we
 
05:04:20.030 --> 05:04:20.040 align:start position:0%
have voter ID and we really mean it you
 
05:04:21.830 --> 05:04:21.840 align:start position:0%
you don't get to say if you don't show
 
05:04:23.690 --> 05:04:23.700 align:start position:0%
up with your identification well I
 
05:04:26.330 --> 05:04:26.340 align:start position:0%
really am trust me we don't we don't you
 
05:04:28.550 --> 05:04:28.560 align:start position:0%
don't do that you you provide the
 
05:04:32.150 --> 05:04:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:33.830 --> 05:04:33.840 align:start position:0%
I'll be happy to take questions well
 
05:04:35.030 --> 05:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
that was easy you're well within your
 
05:04:39.410 --> 05:04:39.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:41.690 --> 05:04:41.700 align:start position:0%
representative Lane
 
05:04:43.070 --> 05:04:43.080 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chair thank you very
 
05:04:45.350 --> 05:04:45.360 align:start position:0%
much I'm not counting questions in
 
05:04:46.550 --> 05:04:46.560 align:start position:0%
anyone's time
 
05:04:48.948 --> 05:04:48.958 align:start position:0%
um so opening five minutes opening Salvo
 
05:04:50.150 --> 05:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
however long the questions go the
 
05:04:57.830 --> 05:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:00.890 --> 05:05:00.900 align:start position:0%
evidence that the existing law has been
 
05:05:02.810 --> 05:05:02.820 align:start position:0%
abused or if anyone or if there's
 
05:05:02.820 --> 05:05:05.510 align:start position:0%
abused or if anyone or if there's
widespread

05:05:05.510 --> 05:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
widespread
 
05:05:07.368 --> 05:05:07.378 align:start position:0%
um fraud in connection with this
 
05:05:09.708 --> 05:05:09.718 align:start position:0%
existing law that there's widespread
 
05:05:12.470 --> 05:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
fraud no I've actually the existing law
 
05:05:15.288 --> 05:05:15.298 align:start position:0%
with the with the affidavit ballot that
 
05:05:17.330 --> 05:05:17.340 align:start position:0%
we now have now has not actually been
 
05:05:18.650 --> 05:05:18.660 align:start position:0%
used yet
 
05:05:19.970 --> 05:05:19.980 align:start position:0%
um but if you're asking is there
 
05:05:22.610 --> 05:05:22.620 align:start position:0%
existing is there widespread existing
 
05:05:24.948 --> 05:05:24.958 align:start position:0%
fraud the real answer is I don't know
 
05:05:27.708 --> 05:05:27.718 align:start position:0%
and the problem the problem is that the
 
05:05:29.690 --> 05:05:29.700 align:start position:0%
election laws the way they exist now
 
05:05:32.150 --> 05:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
make it pretty hard make it pretty hard
 
05:05:34.788 --> 05:05:34.798 align:start position:0%
to prove fraud I mean we've had we've
 
05:05:37.368 --> 05:05:37.378 align:start position:0%
seen a few cases of people voting you
 
05:05:39.050 --> 05:05:39.060 align:start position:0%
know who have voted voted multiple times
 
05:05:41.270 --> 05:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
and have been and have been charged with
 
05:05:43.910 --> 05:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
it but as a practical matter it's pretty
 
05:05:46.788 --> 05:05:46.798 align:start position:0%
hard to prove fraud so so the fact that
 
05:05:49.190 --> 05:05:49.200 align:start position:0%
you know we have we don't have a ton of
 
05:05:52.070 --> 05:05:52.080 align:start position:0%
cases I'm not sure I guess I would I
 
05:05:54.650 --> 05:05:54.660 align:start position:0%
guess I would agree it probably means
 
05:05:58.070 --> 05:05:58.080 align:start position:0%
that there's not widespread fraud it
 
05:06:00.590 --> 05:06:00.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that there may not be a
 
05:06:02.030 --> 05:06:02.040 align:start position:0%
fair amount of fraud that we just don't
 
05:06:04.490 --> 05:06:04.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:06.530 --> 05:06:06.540 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
05:06:10.128 --> 05:06:10.138 align:start position:0%
thank you representative is there uh I
 
05:06:13.550 --> 05:06:13.560 align:start position:0%
guess to focus on uh double voting I'm
 
05:06:16.368 --> 05:06:16.378 align:start position:0%
talking about with the affidavits is
 
05:06:18.830 --> 05:06:18.840 align:start position:0%
there anyone that you're aware of that
 
05:06:21.170 --> 05:06:21.180 align:start position:0%
has been prosecuted or has there been
 
05:06:24.590 --> 05:06:24.600 align:start position:0%
evidence that someone has voted when
 
05:06:26.570 --> 05:06:26.580 align:start position:0%
they weren't supposed to when they
 
05:06:28.310 --> 05:06:28.320 align:start position:0%
signed an affidavit when they signed it
 
05:06:30.288 --> 05:06:30.298 align:start position:0%
after I'm frankly not sure about the
 
05:06:32.510 --> 05:06:32.520 align:start position:0%
people who were prosecuted whether they
 
05:06:36.650 --> 05:06:36.660 align:start position:0%
had signed an affidavit or not
 
05:06:40.250 --> 05:06:40.260 align:start position:0%
um about as to their identity but I do
 
05:06:42.288 --> 05:06:42.298 align:start position:0%
know that that from from what I've heard
 
05:06:44.208 --> 05:06:44.218 align:start position:0%
from both the Attorney General's office
 
05:06:46.250 --> 05:06:46.260 align:start position:0%
and secretary of state is that they've
 
05:06:48.830 --> 05:06:48.840 align:start position:0%
had they've had a fair amount of
 
05:06:51.170 --> 05:06:51.180 align:start position:0%
difficulty in following up there have
 
05:06:52.850 --> 05:06:52.860 align:start position:0%
been a number of cases where they have
 
05:06:55.368 --> 05:06:55.378 align:start position:0%
not been able to follow up on people who
 
05:06:58.070 --> 05:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
said who filed affidavits which I think
 
05:07:02.990 --> 05:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:04.850 --> 05:07:04.860 align:start position:0%
representative weary
 
05:07:07.190 --> 05:07:07.200 align:start position:0%
okay just follow up on thank you Mr
 
05:07:08.628 --> 05:07:08.638 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
05:07:11.030 --> 05:07:11.040 align:start position:0%
can I just follow up on that comment you
 
05:07:12.890 --> 05:07:12.900 align:start position:0%
made about the attorney general and the
 
05:07:15.050 --> 05:07:15.060 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State not right following
 
05:07:17.510 --> 05:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
up could you expand on that a little bit
 
05:07:19.910 --> 05:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
or you know is that lack of resources is
 
05:07:21.830 --> 05:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
that lack of
 
05:07:24.890 --> 05:07:24.900 align:start position:0%
time to pursue whether or not these
 
05:07:26.810 --> 05:07:26.820 align:start position:0%
affidavits are valid no I'm sorry you
 
05:07:29.030 --> 05:07:29.040 align:start position:0%
know I guess maybe I I misspoke a little
 
05:07:30.590 --> 05:07:30.600 align:start position:0%
bit when I when I when I said not follow
 
05:07:32.510 --> 05:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
up what I meant was it's my
 
05:07:33.708 --> 05:07:33.718 align:start position:0%
understanding that there have been a
 
05:07:37.310 --> 05:07:37.320 align:start position:0%
number of situations in which this I
 
05:07:39.050 --> 05:07:39.060 align:start position:0%
either the Secretary of State or the
 
05:07:41.628 --> 05:07:41.638 align:start position:0%
attorney general has sent out the you
 
05:07:43.910 --> 05:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
know the follow-up letters that are
 
05:07:45.288 --> 05:07:45.298 align:start position:0%
supposed to be said and they have not
 
05:07:47.330 --> 05:07:47.340 align:start position:0%
been they have not been returned
 
05:07:50.270 --> 05:07:50.280 align:start position:0%
indicating that you know confirming the
 
05:07:53.510 --> 05:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
person's address as an example now there
 
05:07:55.610 --> 05:07:55.620 align:start position:0%
may there may also be other it I I don't
 
05:07:57.530 --> 05:07:57.540 align:start position:0%
mean to say that the attorney general
 
05:08:00.050 --> 05:08:00.060 align:start position:0%
and the Secretary of State have you know
 
05:08:03.410 --> 05:08:03.420 align:start position:0%
in every case uh sent out the letter I
 
05:08:04.730 --> 05:08:04.740 align:start position:0%
just don't know the answer to that
 
05:08:04.740 --> 05:08:06.770 align:start position:0%
just don't know the answer to that
question

05:08:06.770 --> 05:08:06.780 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:08:09.170 --> 05:08:09.180 align:start position:0%
hello thank you okay and further
 
05:08:09.770 --> 05:08:09.780 align:start position:0%

05:08:32.448 --> 05:08:32.458 align:start position:0%
again the section because I I don't have
 
05:08:34.730 --> 05:08:34.740 align:start position:0%
the same copy of the bill that you do it
 
05:08:39.010 --> 05:08:39.020 align:start position:0%
I think it's RSA 659 colon 13
 
05:08:43.670 --> 05:08:43.680 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral two B okay
 
05:08:46.788 --> 05:08:46.798 align:start position:0%

05:09:03.128 --> 05:09:03.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:05.628 --> 05:09:05.638 align:start position:0%

05:09:11.990 --> 05:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
no yes I'm sorry okay so 13 uh 2B so
 
05:09:13.670 --> 05:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
does this
 
05:09:16.670 --> 05:09:16.680 align:start position:0%
change remove and election officials
 
05:09:19.670 --> 05:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
ability to verify the identity of a
 
05:09:19.680 --> 05:09:21.170 align:start position:0%
ability to verify the identity of a
voter

05:09:21.170 --> 05:09:21.180 align:start position:0%
voter
 
05:09:24.470 --> 05:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
no it would not no in fact I thought I
 
05:09:26.208 --> 05:09:26.218 align:start position:0%
had I thought there's
 
05:09:28.368 --> 05:09:28.378 align:start position:0%
there should be language in there that
 
05:09:28.378 --> 05:09:29.930 align:start position:0%
there should be language in there that
says

05:09:29.930 --> 05:09:29.940 align:start position:0%
says
 
05:09:29.940 --> 05:09:30.830 align:start position:0%
says
um

05:09:30.830 --> 05:09:30.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:09:34.190 --> 05:09:34.200 align:start position:0%
the election official specifically
 
05:09:36.770 --> 05:09:36.780 align:start position:0%
has the authority to do that I believe I
 
05:09:40.310 --> 05:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
mean that the old okay and follow-up
 
05:09:40.320 --> 05:09:43.490 align:start position:0%
mean that the old okay and follow-up
question

05:09:43.490 --> 05:09:43.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:45.350 --> 05:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
yes I'm sorry I was just discovering I
 
05:09:46.730 --> 05:09:46.740 align:start position:0%
was struggling to find that section
 
05:09:48.650 --> 05:09:48.660 align:start position:0%
because I was reading the wrong bill so
 
05:09:50.930 --> 05:09:50.940 align:start position:0%
okay okay so I'm sorry follow-up
 
05:09:52.970 --> 05:09:52.980 align:start position:0%
question so I don't know I I guess I'm
 
05:09:54.490 --> 05:09:54.500 align:start position:0%
confused so
 
05:09:57.590 --> 05:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
yes you do say that the moderator or
 
05:10:00.948 --> 05:10:00.958 align:start position:0%
supervisor to the checklist or Clerk
 
05:10:04.550 --> 05:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:06.708 --> 05:10:06.718 align:start position:0%
to verify a voter
 
05:10:09.590 --> 05:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
and but then it says
 
05:10:09.600 --> 05:10:11.030 align:start position:0%
and but then it says
um

05:10:11.030 --> 05:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:10:13.430 --> 05:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
as if no verification was made so
 
05:10:16.128 --> 05:10:16.138 align:start position:0%
someone can challenge the voter will be
 
05:10:18.170 --> 05:10:18.180 align:start position:0%
required to execute a challenge but or
 
05:10:21.368 --> 05:10:21.378 align:start position:0%
affidavit as if no verification was made
 
05:10:24.110 --> 05:10:24.120 align:start position:0%
and then the rest of the section is
 
05:10:25.510 --> 05:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
crossed out
 
05:10:28.490 --> 05:10:28.500 align:start position:0%
you know what uh you know representative
 
05:10:31.128 --> 05:10:31.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:35.090 --> 05:10:35.100 align:start position:0%
I I filed with the committee an
 
05:10:38.030 --> 05:10:38.040 align:start position:0%
amendment to the original bill
 
05:10:39.708 --> 05:10:39.718 align:start position:0%
um which I I thought I sent to all
 
05:10:41.030 --> 05:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
members of the committee it's Amendment
 
05:10:45.010 --> 05:10:45.020 align:start position:0%
the amendment number is 2023
 
05:10:48.470 --> 05:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
0208h and it
 
05:10:51.170 --> 05:10:51.180 align:start position:0%
when when I got the original Bill back
 
05:10:53.030 --> 05:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
from OLS
 
05:10:56.150 --> 05:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
that it was it was like 90 right but
 
05:10:58.190 --> 05:10:58.200 align:start position:0%
there were a couple of sections sort of
 
05:11:00.170 --> 05:11:00.180 align:start position:0%
towards the end that I I'm not quite
 
05:11:02.570 --> 05:11:02.580 align:start position:0%
sure what what happened but there were
 
05:11:04.910 --> 05:11:04.920 align:start position:0%
some mistakes and it was it was so close
 
05:11:06.830 --> 05:11:06.840 align:start position:0%
to the deadline that I just you know I
 
05:11:08.510 --> 05:11:08.520 align:start position:0%
said I approve and I'll make the changes
 
05:11:11.208 --> 05:11:11.218 align:start position:0%
later and then I did make them and I
 
05:11:13.368 --> 05:11:13.378 align:start position:0%
thought I had sent that amendment to all
 
05:11:15.288 --> 05:11:15.298 align:start position:0%
members of this committee if I didn't I
 
05:11:17.990 --> 05:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
apologize and I will certainly get it to
 
05:11:22.010 --> 05:11:22.020 align:start position:0%
you but it made it it it made some of
 
05:11:23.690 --> 05:11:23.700 align:start position:0%
the it sounds some of the language that
 
05:11:26.770 --> 05:11:26.780 align:start position:0%
you were reading about you know
 
05:11:29.868 --> 05:11:29.878 align:start position:0%
affidavit ballot I that that was some of
 
05:11:31.550 --> 05:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
the language that was left in by mistake
 
05:11:33.770 --> 05:11:33.780 align:start position:0%
and I took out so I think now with the
 
05:11:37.390 --> 05:11:37.400 align:start position:0%
with the amendment it it does sort of
 
05:11:39.410 --> 05:11:39.420 align:start position:0%
straighten out that problem I believe
 
05:11:41.270 --> 05:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
okay thank you I haven't seen the
 
05:11:44.390 --> 05:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
amendment okay I apologize for that as I
 
05:11:45.770 --> 05:11:45.780 align:start position:0%
say I thought I sent it to all members
 
05:11:47.270 --> 05:11:47.280 align:start position:0%
in the committee a while ago but I
 
05:11:49.490 --> 05:11:49.500 align:start position:0%
believe our clerk has it and she is
 
05:11:51.170 --> 05:11:51.180 align:start position:0%
going to distribute it to us shortly
 
05:11:54.170 --> 05:11:54.180 align:start position:0%
okay um I have not seen the amendment
 
05:12:02.570 --> 05:12:02.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:05.570 --> 05:12:05.580 align:start position:0%
um thank you you and thank you again
 
05:12:07.850 --> 05:12:07.860 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot of expansion in the
 
05:12:07.860 --> 05:12:08.830 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot of expansion in the
bill

05:12:08.830 --> 05:12:08.840 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:12:12.530 --> 05:12:12.540 align:start position:0%
about challenges and how those work
 
05:12:15.590 --> 05:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
can you give a rationale for those
 
05:12:17.810 --> 05:12:17.820 align:start position:0%
particularly if they're happening on the
 
05:12:21.470 --> 05:12:21.480 align:start position:0%
same day as as the election sure I mean
 
05:12:24.050 --> 05:12:24.060 align:start position:0%
I guess what the what the um
 
05:12:24.060 --> 05:12:25.250 align:start position:0%
I guess what the what the um
the

05:12:25.250 --> 05:12:25.260 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:12:28.690 --> 05:12:28.700 align:start position:0%
the bill doesn't change
 
05:12:31.610 --> 05:12:31.620 align:start position:0%
existing law all that much with regard
 
05:12:34.190 --> 05:12:34.200 align:start position:0%
to the way challenges are made but it's
 
05:12:36.770 --> 05:12:36.780 align:start position:0%
it's simply I mean the main change that
 
05:12:41.208 --> 05:12:41.218 align:start position:0%
it says is if if a challenge is made and
 
05:12:43.368 --> 05:12:43.378 align:start position:0%
the grounds for the challenge
 
05:12:45.470 --> 05:12:45.480 align:start position:0%
don't really change you know what they
 
05:12:47.810 --> 05:12:47.820 align:start position:0%
are under existing law but if they're if
 
05:12:51.708 --> 05:12:51.718 align:start position:0%
a challenge is made then the mod the
 
05:12:54.650 --> 05:12:54.660 align:start position:0%
moderator or election official makes the
 
05:12:57.410 --> 05:12:57.420 align:start position:0%
decision on the challenge and if that is
 
05:13:00.530 --> 05:13:00.540 align:start position:0%
if the if a person whoever is not happy
 
05:13:02.990 --> 05:13:03.000 align:start position:0%
with that decision has an immediate
 
05:13:05.150 --> 05:13:05.160 align:start position:0%
opportunity to go to Superior Court to
 
05:13:06.470 --> 05:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
challenge it
 
05:13:08.510 --> 05:13:08.520 align:start position:0%
um that that part the immediately going
 
05:13:12.350 --> 05:13:12.360 align:start position:0%
to Superior Court is is is new
 
05:13:14.930 --> 05:13:14.940 align:start position:0%
um because under the you know under you
 
05:13:17.448 --> 05:13:17.458 align:start position:0%
that was less necessary under the system
 
05:13:19.310 --> 05:13:19.320 align:start position:0%
where you had this affidavit ballot and
 
05:13:20.930 --> 05:13:20.940 align:start position:0%
a certain waiting period so this
 
05:13:23.270 --> 05:13:23.280 align:start position:0%
provides for an immediate challenge to
 
05:13:25.310 --> 05:13:25.320 align:start position:0%
the Superior Court
 
05:13:28.190 --> 05:13:28.200 align:start position:0%
um that's that's I guess I would say
 
05:13:30.288 --> 05:13:30.298 align:start position:0%
that's probably the main the main
 
05:13:30.298 --> 05:13:34.610 align:start position:0%
that's probably the main the main
difference

05:13:34.610 --> 05:13:34.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:35.990 --> 05:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:13:39.410 --> 05:13:39.420 align:start position:0%
um so if you're voting at six o'clock at
 
05:13:42.110 --> 05:13:42.120 align:start position:0%
night and you weren't challenged
 
05:13:44.270 --> 05:13:44.280 align:start position:0%
Superior Court is closed and the
 
05:13:45.948 --> 05:13:45.958 align:start position:0%
election is going to close in an hour or
 
05:13:50.510 --> 05:13:50.520 align:start position:0%
two is that really a remedy that's gonna
 
05:13:53.150 --> 05:13:53.160 align:start position:0%
work sure you know I I mean I I guess I
 
05:13:55.430 --> 05:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
agree with you that that you know that
 
05:13:56.690 --> 05:13:56.700 align:start position:0%
could present a problem in that
 
05:13:59.270 --> 05:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
circumstance you know I
 
05:14:02.448 --> 05:14:02.458 align:start position:0%
what all of this incl including the no
 
05:14:07.550 --> 05:14:07.560 align:start position:0%
excuse absentee I mean no excuse uh uh I
 
05:14:09.590 --> 05:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
voter identification
 
05:14:11.990 --> 05:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
I think one of the things that it says
 
05:14:13.788 --> 05:14:13.798 align:start position:0%
and I think it's entirely proper to say
 
05:14:14.930 --> 05:14:14.940 align:start position:0%
this is
 
05:14:18.050 --> 05:14:18.060 align:start position:0%
you know we want voting to be
 
05:14:21.170 --> 05:14:21.180 align:start position:0%
open and accessible and all that but it
 
05:14:23.750 --> 05:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that you know it's that you
 
05:14:25.550 --> 05:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
don't have to exercise some
 
05:14:28.490 --> 05:14:28.500 align:start position:0%
responsibility so that maybe it means if
 
05:14:31.310 --> 05:14:31.320 align:start position:0%
you know that you you know you don't
 
05:14:33.830 --> 05:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
have identification or that there's some
 
05:14:35.810 --> 05:14:35.820 align:start position:0%
that there might be some reason for your
 
05:14:37.610 --> 05:14:37.620 align:start position:0%
being challenged maybe you ought to get
 
05:14:39.770 --> 05:14:39.780 align:start position:0%
to the polls a little earlier
 
05:14:42.410 --> 05:14:42.420 align:start position:0%
um that's you know and and if and I
 
05:14:44.270 --> 05:14:44.280 align:start position:0%
suppose if you had a situation where
 
05:14:47.090 --> 05:14:47.100 align:start position:0%
somebody you know it really was a
 
05:14:49.670 --> 05:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
circumstance where a challenge just kind
 
05:14:51.350 --> 05:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
of came out of the blue
 
05:14:52.970 --> 05:14:52.980 align:start position:0%
um and it was and it was late and the
 
05:14:55.310 --> 05:14:55.320 align:start position:0%
person couldn't get that challenge in
 
05:14:57.948 --> 05:14:57.958 align:start position:0%
superior court within the time you know
 
05:15:00.470 --> 05:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
before the polls closed I suppose if it
 
05:15:02.810 --> 05:15:02.820 align:start position:0%
was a valid challenge the person could
 
05:15:05.690 --> 05:15:05.700 align:start position:0%
go to Superior Court and have and have a
 
05:15:07.310 --> 05:15:07.320 align:start position:0%
ruling that the person's vote would
 
05:15:09.530 --> 05:15:09.540 align:start position:0%
count and you know I suppose again in
 
05:15:11.990 --> 05:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
the unlikely circumstance that it made a
 
05:15:12.000 --> 05:15:13.250 align:start position:0%
the unlikely circumstance that it made a
difference

05:15:13.250 --> 05:15:13.260 align:start position:0%
difference
 
05:15:15.410 --> 05:15:15.420 align:start position:0%
um that maybe you know maybe that would
 
05:15:17.510 --> 05:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
change the result of an election
 
05:15:19.430 --> 05:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
I think that's unlikely but it possibly
 
05:15:21.350 --> 05:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
could happen
 
05:15:23.750 --> 05:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
further questions representative
 
05:15:25.430 --> 05:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
05:15:25.440 --> 05:15:26.390 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
question

05:15:26.390 --> 05:15:26.400 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:15:29.690 --> 05:15:29.700 align:start position:0%
when a voter signs an affidavit is it
 
05:15:32.208 --> 05:15:32.218 align:start position:0%
not true that they are signing in
 
05:15:36.770 --> 05:15:36.780 align:start position:0%
accordance with RSA 659 colon 34 the
 
05:15:38.628 --> 05:15:38.638 align:start position:0%
penalty for knowingly and purposely
 
05:15:40.368 --> 05:15:40.378 align:start position:0%
providing false information when
 
05:15:42.650 --> 05:15:42.660 align:start position:0%
registering to vote or voting is a class
 
05:15:45.890 --> 05:15:45.900 align:start position:0%
A misdemeanor with obviously penalties
 
05:15:49.490 --> 05:15:49.500 align:start position:0%
Associated for violating the law right
 
05:15:53.288 --> 05:15:53.298 align:start position:0%
is that oh that's true you know the the
 
05:15:57.590 --> 05:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
perjury is is one of the most difficult
 
05:16:01.368 --> 05:16:01.378 align:start position:0%
things to prove and so you know as a
 
05:16:04.310 --> 05:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
practical matter perjury happens in the
 
05:16:06.890 --> 05:16:06.900 align:start position:0%
courts a lot and it never gets
 
05:16:08.690 --> 05:16:08.700 align:start position:0%
prosecuted because it's very hard to
 
05:16:08.700 --> 05:16:09.948 align:start position:0%
prosecuted because it's very hard to
prove

05:16:09.948 --> 05:16:09.958 align:start position:0%
prove
 
05:16:13.850 --> 05:16:13.860 align:start position:0%
um and so you know it would it uh it it
 
05:16:16.850 --> 05:16:16.860 align:start position:0%
it is is the the need to sign an
 
05:16:19.910 --> 05:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
affidavit under oath a deterrent yeah I
 
05:16:21.470 --> 05:16:21.480 align:start position:0%
would agree it's some deterrent it's
 
05:16:23.330 --> 05:16:23.340 align:start position:0%
certainly better than not having not
 
05:16:25.788 --> 05:16:25.798 align:start position:0%
saying anything but is it you know does
 
05:16:29.270 --> 05:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
it is it is it a better alternative than
 
05:16:31.070 --> 05:16:31.080 align:start position:0%
requiring somebody to provide
 
05:16:33.230 --> 05:16:33.240 align:start position:0%
identification doesn't come close in my
 
05:16:33.240 --> 05:16:34.010 align:start position:0%
identification doesn't come close in my
view

05:16:34.010 --> 05:16:34.020 align:start position:0%
view
 
05:16:37.128 --> 05:16:37.138 align:start position:0%
follow up please and are you aware of
 
05:16:40.550 --> 05:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
any evidence to suggest that
 
05:16:43.850 --> 05:16:43.860 align:start position:0%
there is a major issue with our Avid
 
05:16:46.850 --> 05:16:46.860 align:start position:0%
affidavit process am I aware of any
 
05:16:49.190 --> 05:16:49.200 align:start position:0%
evidence that as I said before I don't
 
05:16:50.868 --> 05:16:50.878 align:start position:0%
know on the cases that have been
 
05:16:53.270 --> 05:16:53.280 align:start position:0%
prosecuted involving somebody who voted
 
05:16:55.330 --> 05:16:55.340 align:start position:0%
more than once
 
05:16:57.530 --> 05:16:57.540 align:start position:0%
whether any of those had filed
 
05:17:00.350 --> 05:17:00.360 align:start position:0%
affidavits and I also don't I don't have
 
05:17:02.390 --> 05:17:02.400 align:start position:0%
an answer but I think the very fact that
 
05:17:05.270 --> 05:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
we asked the question raises an issue in
 
05:17:08.330 --> 05:17:08.340 align:start position:0%
itself of the all the you know
 
05:17:11.270 --> 05:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
verification letters that are sent out
 
05:17:14.030 --> 05:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
and have not been returned
 
05:17:15.770 --> 05:17:15.780 align:start position:0%
um those you know I don't again I don't
 
05:17:17.390 --> 05:17:17.400 align:start position:0%
know how many of them there are but my
 
05:17:19.368 --> 05:17:19.378 align:start position:0%
understanding from the reading from the
 
05:17:21.110 --> 05:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
Press is that there have been a fair
 
05:17:23.750 --> 05:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
number of those and so again that raises
 
05:17:26.150 --> 05:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
a question of
 
05:17:27.830 --> 05:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
where are those people who are those
 
05:17:27.840 --> 05:17:30.708 align:start position:0%
where are those people who are those
people

05:17:30.708 --> 05:17:30.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:32.750 --> 05:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
05:17:37.128 --> 05:17:37.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:38.810 --> 05:17:38.820 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
05:17:39.948 --> 05:17:39.958 align:start position:0%
my question
 
05:17:42.470 --> 05:17:42.480 align:start position:0%
in your response to representative
 
05:17:46.490 --> 05:17:46.500 align:start position:0%
Brennan uh with regard to uh
 
05:17:49.730 --> 05:17:49.740 align:start position:0%
it being hard to prove perjury are you
 
05:17:53.390 --> 05:17:53.400 align:start position:0%
implying that maybe one of the intents
 
05:17:55.910 --> 05:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
for this bill is because of the weakness
 
05:17:58.310 --> 05:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
of our justice system I'm sorry the the
 
05:18:01.310 --> 05:18:01.320 align:start position:0%
weakness because the weakness the
 
05:18:04.128 --> 05:18:04.138 align:start position:0%
weakness justice system
 
05:18:06.230 --> 05:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
I mean I suppose in some sense it's hard
 
05:18:08.750 --> 05:18:08.760 align:start position:0%
you know I'm not quite sure
 
05:18:10.490 --> 05:18:10.500 align:start position:0%
how we
 
05:18:13.788 --> 05:18:13.798 align:start position:0%
how we make it less difficult to prove
 
05:18:15.708 --> 05:18:15.718 align:start position:0%
perjury that but but to the extent that
 
05:18:17.270 --> 05:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
you say that's a weakness in the justice
 
05:18:20.030 --> 05:18:20.040 align:start position:0%
system I guess I agree with it
 
05:18:21.770 --> 05:18:21.780 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:18:23.150 --> 05:18:23.160 align:start position:0%
okay further questions from the
 
05:18:23.160 --> 05:18:24.890 align:start position:0%
okay further questions from the
committee

05:18:24.890 --> 05:18:24.900 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:18:26.150 --> 05:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
um I have a few
 
05:18:30.050 --> 05:18:30.060 align:start position:0%
first one is so I'm looking at how
 
05:18:33.110 --> 05:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
you've restructured the
 
05:18:33.120 --> 05:18:34.010 align:start position:0%
you've restructured the
um

05:18:34.010 --> 05:18:34.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:18:35.750 --> 05:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
the identification you have to prove to
 
05:18:37.670 --> 05:18:37.680 align:start position:0%
provide citizenship So currently you
 
05:18:39.350 --> 05:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
have to provide citizenship
 
05:18:41.628 --> 05:18:41.638 align:start position:0%
um It's actually kind of hard
 
05:18:43.070 --> 05:18:43.080 align:start position:0%
um you have to basically produce
 
05:18:44.868 --> 05:18:44.878 align:start position:0%
effectively two government documents so
 
05:18:46.788 --> 05:18:46.798 align:start position:0%
if I think like that uh yours actually
 
05:18:48.590 --> 05:18:48.600 align:start position:0%
makes it easier to prove citizenship you
 
05:18:51.050 --> 05:18:51.060 align:start position:0%
may you are taking
 
05:18:51.060 --> 05:18:51.770 align:start position:0%
may you are taking
um

05:18:51.770 --> 05:18:51.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:18:53.570 --> 05:18:53.580 align:start position:0%
basically you're putting at least my
 
05:18:55.010 --> 05:18:55.020 align:start position:0%
understanding of this bill is is the
 
05:18:56.510 --> 05:18:56.520 align:start position:0%
citizenship would be underneath the same
 
05:18:59.448 --> 05:18:59.458 align:start position:0%
requirement as section D on the second
 
05:19:04.010 --> 05:19:04.020 align:start position:0%
page lines 23 so you take a photo
 
05:19:05.810 --> 05:19:05.820 align:start position:0%
driver's license issued by any federal
 
05:19:07.250 --> 05:19:07.260 align:start position:0%
or state government United States
 
05:19:09.110 --> 05:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
passport service identification photo
 
05:19:11.570 --> 05:19:11.580 align:start position:0%
notification photo application issued by
 
05:19:13.730 --> 05:19:13.740 align:start position:0%
state or local government or any other
 
05:19:15.530 --> 05:19:15.540 align:start position:0%
evidence that reasonably establishes
 
05:19:17.930 --> 05:19:17.940 align:start position:0%
that it is more than likely that it's
 
05:19:19.788 --> 05:19:19.798 align:start position:0%
more likely than not that the person is
 
05:19:23.208 --> 05:19:23.218 align:start position:0%
who he or she claims to be so basically
 
05:19:24.650 --> 05:19:24.660 align:start position:0%
you're saying if they show up with
 
05:19:24.660 --> 05:19:25.788 align:start position:0%
you're saying if they show up with
anything

05:19:25.788 --> 05:19:25.798 align:start position:0%
anything
 
05:19:28.490 --> 05:19:28.500 align:start position:0%
that is reasonable we're going to let
 
05:19:29.930 --> 05:19:29.940 align:start position:0%
them vote no that's you know what you're
 
05:19:31.730 --> 05:19:31.740 align:start position:0%
reading under the identities that's how
 
05:19:33.770 --> 05:19:33.780 align:start position:0%
you prove identity okay so this is for
 
05:19:35.570 --> 05:19:35.580 align:start position:0%
when they're that's for identity so what
 
05:19:37.490 --> 05:19:37.500 align:start position:0%
is it for registration first for
 
05:19:37.500 --> 05:19:38.810 align:start position:0%
is it for registration first for
citizenship

05:19:38.810 --> 05:19:38.820 align:start position:0%
citizenship
 
05:19:42.230 --> 05:19:42.240 align:start position:0%
the supervisor it's in subsection 1A on
 
05:19:44.448 --> 05:19:44.458 align:start position:0%
the first page the supervisors of the
 
05:19:46.250 --> 05:19:46.260 align:start position:0%
checklist or the town or city clerk
 
05:19:48.890 --> 05:19:48.900 align:start position:0%
shall accept from the applicant any one
 
05:19:50.990 --> 05:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
of the following as proof of citizenship
 
05:19:52.970 --> 05:19:52.980 align:start position:0%
the applicant's birth certificate
 
05:19:55.970 --> 05:19:55.980 align:start position:0%
passport naturalization papers if the
 
05:19:58.430 --> 05:19:58.440 align:start position:0%
applicant is a naturalized citizen or
 
05:20:01.128 --> 05:20:01.138 align:start position:0%
any other reasonable documentation which
 
05:20:02.750 --> 05:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
indicates the applicant is a United
 
05:20:05.150 --> 05:20:05.160 align:start position:0%
States citizen and it's although it
 
05:20:06.708 --> 05:20:06.718 align:start position:0%
seems to me that you know there I mean
 
05:20:11.270 --> 05:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
to some extent if if the current law
 
05:20:13.970 --> 05:20:13.980 align:start position:0%
does not have that last clause about any
 
05:20:16.550 --> 05:20:16.560 align:start position:0%
other reasonable documentation then you
 
05:20:17.868 --> 05:20:17.878 align:start position:0%
know then I guess I would agree that
 
05:20:20.810 --> 05:20:20.820 align:start position:0%
this does open up the categories of how
 
05:20:23.030 --> 05:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
you prove citizenship I'm just not sure
 
05:20:25.910 --> 05:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
what the uh if the current loss has has
 
05:20:29.390 --> 05:20:29.400 align:start position:0%
uh the catch-all phrase that is in this
 
05:20:31.490 --> 05:20:31.500 align:start position:0%
bill I don't know if it does or not um
 
05:20:32.570 --> 05:20:32.580 align:start position:0%
that's a great question I don't know at
 
05:20:33.708 --> 05:20:33.718 align:start position:0%
the top of my head I thought it didn't
 
05:20:35.448 --> 05:20:35.458 align:start position:0%
but I definitely reserve the right to be
 
05:20:36.770 --> 05:20:36.780 align:start position:0%
wrong about that
 
05:20:38.208 --> 05:20:38.218 align:start position:0%
um and one final question so you were a
 
05:20:38.218 --> 05:20:39.410 align:start position:0%
um and one final question so you were a
judge

05:20:39.410 --> 05:20:39.420 align:start position:0%
judge
 
05:20:41.090 --> 05:20:41.100 align:start position:0%
um you deal with prosecutors how do you
 
05:20:43.730 --> 05:20:43.740 align:start position:0%
find somebody uh who's committed a crime
 
05:20:46.070 --> 05:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
perjury Class A misdemeanor uh when you
 
05:20:49.128 --> 05:20:49.138 align:start position:0%
don't have their name their address or
 
05:20:50.570 --> 05:20:50.580 align:start position:0%
any other piece of information from them
 
05:20:51.948 --> 05:20:51.958 align:start position:0%
other than a signature on a piece of
 
05:20:51.958 --> 05:20:53.030 align:start position:0%
other than a signature on a piece of
paper

05:20:53.030 --> 05:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
paper
 
05:20:55.250 --> 05:20:55.260 align:start position:0%
pretty hard okay pretty hard to uh
 
05:20:57.050 --> 05:20:57.060 align:start position:0%
pretty hard to to get that information
 
05:20:59.810 --> 05:20:59.820 align:start position:0%
to make a prosecution thank you uh
 
05:21:00.948 --> 05:21:00.958 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
05:21:03.170 --> 05:21:03.180 align:start position:0%
all right thank you thank you uh it's
 
05:21:03.890 --> 05:21:03.900 align:start position:0%
always hard for me to call
 
05:21:06.110 --> 05:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
Representative Justice Lynn
 
05:21:09.530 --> 05:21:09.540 align:start position:0%
but Bob is fine thank you very much okay
 
05:21:10.850 --> 05:21:10.860 align:start position:0%
um we've got quite a few people assigned
 
05:21:12.470 --> 05:21:12.480 align:start position:0%
to speak let me kind of address how I
 
05:21:13.850 --> 05:21:13.860 align:start position:0%
ordered these
 
05:21:15.288 --> 05:21:15.298 align:start position:0%
um I did state representatives first
 
05:21:16.850 --> 05:21:16.860 align:start position:0%
only one that's pretty common in
 
05:21:19.010 --> 05:21:19.020 align:start position:0%
practice uh after that I did names that
 
05:21:21.350 --> 05:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
I didn't recognize uh so we'll call up
 
05:21:23.208 --> 05:21:23.218 align:start position:0%
not our frequent flyers uh welcome to
 
05:21:24.770 --> 05:21:24.780 align:start position:0%
election law and then after that anyone
 
05:21:27.230 --> 05:21:27.240 align:start position:0%
who is here on behalf of an organization
 
05:21:29.390 --> 05:21:29.400 align:start position:0%
uh is going towards the tail end uh
 
05:21:30.948 --> 05:21:30.958 align:start position:0%
because you're probably probably getting
 
05:21:32.810 --> 05:21:32.820 align:start position:0%
paid so you can hang out
 
05:21:35.510 --> 05:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
um so uh not everybody to be fair not
 
05:21:37.850 --> 05:21:37.860 align:start position:0%
everybody but you you are here versus
 
05:21:40.490 --> 05:21:40.500 align:start position:0%
our normal people uh so the first one uh
 
05:21:42.948 --> 05:21:42.958 align:start position:0%
representative uh pope of each Mueller
 
05:21:52.250 --> 05:21:52.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:54.948 --> 05:21:54.958 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair
 
05:21:57.650 --> 05:21:57.660 align:start position:0%
um using my cell phone to time myself I
 
05:21:59.868 --> 05:21:59.878 align:start position:0%
want to stick to the three minutes I uh
 
05:22:04.390 --> 05:22:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:07.610 --> 05:22:07.620 align:start position:0%
hard as it may be to believe my intent
 
05:22:10.550 --> 05:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
when co-sponsoring this bill is to have
 
05:22:13.368 --> 05:22:13.378 align:start position:0%
it as a non-partisan bill I do recognize
 
05:22:15.050 --> 05:22:15.060 align:start position:0%
this is not how it's seen by a lot of
 
05:22:17.270 --> 05:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
the people in the room I'm not that
 
05:22:22.190 --> 05:22:22.200 align:start position:0%
naive but as far as I can tell we all
 
05:22:24.230 --> 05:22:24.240 align:start position:0%
have an interest in making sure our
 
05:22:27.650 --> 05:22:27.660 align:start position:0%
elections are run the right way and that
 
05:22:29.750 --> 05:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
the right people who have the right to
 
05:22:31.610 --> 05:22:31.620 align:start position:0%
vote vote and the people who don't have
 
05:22:33.708 --> 05:22:33.718 align:start position:0%
the right to vote are not allowed to
 
05:22:33.718 --> 05:22:36.590 align:start position:0%
the right to vote are not allowed to
vote

05:22:36.590 --> 05:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:39.230 --> 05:22:39.240 align:start position:0%
I'm a naturalized citizen
 
05:22:42.050 --> 05:22:42.060 align:start position:0%
came from Eastern Europe Romania may as
 
05:22:44.030 --> 05:22:44.040 align:start position:0%
well ruin the whole against Daniel's
 
05:22:45.970 --> 05:22:45.980 align:start position:0%
action game for everybody
 
05:22:50.090 --> 05:22:50.100 align:start position:0%
but I spend a long time working towards
 
05:22:52.550 --> 05:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
my citizenship and I think we should
 
05:22:54.170 --> 05:22:54.180 align:start position:0%
make it easier for people to get
 
05:22:56.090 --> 05:22:56.100 align:start position:0%
naturalized but that's a different story
 
05:22:57.590 --> 05:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
what I want to tell you is what happened
 
05:22:59.690 --> 05:22:59.700 align:start position:0%
to me when I went to register as a voter
 
05:23:01.910 --> 05:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
in Walton Massachusetts where I lived at
 
05:23:03.110 --> 05:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
the time
 
05:23:06.050 --> 05:23:06.060 align:start position:0%
it's around 2008 I finally get my
 
05:23:08.390 --> 05:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
naturalization certificate literally the
 
05:23:10.550 --> 05:23:10.560 align:start position:0%
next day I walk with it proudly to the
 
05:23:13.330 --> 05:23:13.340 align:start position:0%
city hall and say I want to be
 
05:23:15.590 --> 05:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
registered as a voter and I put the
 
05:23:19.310 --> 05:23:19.320 align:start position:0%
naturalization certificate on the desk
 
05:23:21.350 --> 05:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
and the nice lady who worked the desk
 
05:23:24.770 --> 05:23:24.780 align:start position:0%
literally walked back and just hands up
 
05:23:26.990 --> 05:23:27.000 align:start position:0%
and said you have to remove that from my
 
05:23:29.208 --> 05:23:29.218 align:start position:0%
counter like what are you talking about
 
05:23:30.530 --> 05:23:30.540 align:start position:0%
well it's your naturalization
 
05:23:32.990 --> 05:23:33.000 align:start position:0%
certificate we are not allowed to look
 
05:23:35.030 --> 05:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
at those
 
05:23:36.530 --> 05:23:36.540 align:start position:0%
what do you mean
 
05:23:38.990 --> 05:23:39.000 align:start position:0%
well you know you just file an affidavit
 
05:23:41.810 --> 05:23:41.820 align:start position:0%
the city specifically says you are not
 
05:23:43.670 --> 05:23:43.680 align:start position:0%
allowed to check even if it's offered
 
05:23:46.430 --> 05:23:46.440 align:start position:0%
you may not look at the documents I
 
05:23:48.230 --> 05:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
swear to God this is exactly what
 
05:23:50.330 --> 05:23:50.340 align:start position:0%
happened to me personally this is not a
 
05:23:52.250 --> 05:23:52.260 align:start position:0%
story from somebody else this is my
 
05:23:53.810 --> 05:23:53.820 align:start position:0%
personal experience
 
05:23:56.930 --> 05:23:56.940 align:start position:0%
and I'm like how do you know people
 
05:23:59.570 --> 05:23:59.580 align:start position:0%
don't lie on the affidavit and they say
 
05:24:01.190 --> 05:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
oh it's a ten thousand dollar fine
 
05:24:03.288 --> 05:24:03.298 align:start position:0%
nobody would risk that
 
05:24:05.448 --> 05:24:05.458 align:start position:0%
so of course I asked them so how many of
 
05:24:07.730 --> 05:24:07.740 align:start position:0%
those did you issue
 
05:24:09.590 --> 05:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
you all know the answer is zero already
 
05:24:09.600 --> 05:24:12.708 align:start position:0%
you all know the answer is zero already
right

05:24:12.708 --> 05:24:12.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:14.750 --> 05:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
this is
 
05:24:17.330 --> 05:24:17.340 align:start position:0%
both a true story and my answer to the
 
05:24:19.670 --> 05:24:19.680 align:start position:0%
ones of you that ask well can you prove
 
05:24:21.708 --> 05:24:21.718 align:start position:0%
there is a problem
 
05:24:24.110 --> 05:24:24.120 align:start position:0%
there are sometimes situations in which
 
05:24:26.868 --> 05:24:26.878 align:start position:0%
systems are set up that it is impossible
 
05:24:28.788 --> 05:24:28.798 align:start position:0%
to measure the problem because there is
 
05:24:30.410 --> 05:24:30.420 align:start position:0%
no way to actually
 
05:24:33.948 --> 05:24:33.958 align:start position:0%
capture the data how am I gonna
 
05:24:36.530 --> 05:24:36.540 align:start position:0%
find out who the people are and whether
 
05:24:39.590 --> 05:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
they broke the law if I cannot find them
 
05:24:42.948 --> 05:24:42.958 align:start position:0%
after they voted if they are gone from
 
05:24:44.628 --> 05:24:44.638 align:start position:0%
whatever the address they said they were
 
05:24:47.868 --> 05:24:47.878 align:start position:0%
gonna live in how do I locate them to
 
05:24:51.230 --> 05:24:51.240 align:start position:0%
establish who they were and I don't know
 
05:24:53.750 --> 05:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
of any way to fix that
 
05:24:55.910 --> 05:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
other than maybe use all those you know
 
05:24:58.430 --> 05:24:58.440 align:start position:0%
letters of confirmation that we sent and
 
05:25:00.470 --> 05:25:00.480 align:start position:0%
hopefully use it as a proxy for people
 
05:25:02.390 --> 05:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
that are suspicious
 
05:25:05.090 --> 05:25:05.100 align:start position:0%
but I agree that not that's not very
 
05:25:07.070 --> 05:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
good data
 
05:25:09.110 --> 05:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
the intent of this legislation is not to
 
05:25:11.510 --> 05:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
disenfranchise anyone and I say that as
 
05:25:13.730 --> 05:25:13.740 align:start position:0%
a co-sponsor of this legislation and I
 
05:25:16.010 --> 05:25:16.020 align:start position:0%
swear to God that's true this being said
 
05:25:18.530 --> 05:25:18.540 align:start position:0%
is it possible to come up with a
 
05:25:21.230 --> 05:25:21.240 align:start position:0%
scenario in which somebody who should be
 
05:25:23.150 --> 05:25:23.160 align:start position:0%
a voter due to a certain set of
 
05:25:25.850 --> 05:25:25.860 align:start position:0%
circumstances may be unable to vote at
 
05:25:26.990 --> 05:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
some point
 
05:25:29.390 --> 05:25:29.400 align:start position:0%
of course we can hypotheticals are fun
 
05:25:31.788 --> 05:25:31.798 align:start position:0%
and we can always argue over How likely
 
05:25:32.750 --> 05:25:32.760 align:start position:0%
they are
 
05:25:36.050 --> 05:25:36.060 align:start position:0%
when we try to pass legislation we have
 
05:25:38.628 --> 05:25:38.638 align:start position:0%
to look at it as
 
05:25:41.330 --> 05:25:41.340 align:start position:0%
on the balance does the good does it do
 
05:25:43.970 --> 05:25:43.980 align:start position:0%
that it does outweigh the potential
 
05:25:47.090 --> 05:25:47.100 align:start position:0%
negative consequences that are not in
 
05:25:48.590 --> 05:25:48.600 align:start position:0%
the spirit of the law
 
05:25:51.110 --> 05:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
it is my honest belief that this
 
05:25:53.990 --> 05:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
legislation if passed will have good
 
05:25:55.970 --> 05:25:55.980 align:start position:0%
consequences that will outweigh the bad
 
05:25:58.250 --> 05:25:58.260 align:start position:0%
I also recognize that a lot of the
 
05:26:00.530 --> 05:26:00.540 align:start position:0%
people I spoke with you know for half an
 
05:26:02.390 --> 05:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
hour at 9 30 this morning that were
 
05:26:05.030 --> 05:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
holding signs opposing this bill Phil
 
05:26:07.788 --> 05:26:07.798 align:start position:0%
otherwise and I recognize that's a
 
05:26:07.798 --> 05:26:08.690 align:start position:0%
otherwise and I recognize that's a
difference

05:26:08.690 --> 05:26:08.700 align:start position:0%
difference
 
05:26:12.110 --> 05:26:12.120 align:start position:0%
and I respect that but where I'm coming
 
05:26:14.090 --> 05:26:14.100 align:start position:0%
from based on all the data and my
 
05:26:16.550 --> 05:26:16.560 align:start position:0%
experience I believe this to be a bill
 
05:26:18.530 --> 05:26:18.540 align:start position:0%
where the good outweighs the bad I
 
05:26:20.448 --> 05:26:20.458 align:start position:0%
really appreciate you allowing me to
 
05:26:22.250 --> 05:26:22.260 align:start position:0%
cheat a little bit on the three minutes
 
05:26:24.470 --> 05:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
it was not International thank you it's
 
05:26:27.110 --> 05:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
okay you still have 40 seconds
 
05:26:29.810 --> 05:26:29.820 align:start position:0%
um questions from the committee
 
05:26:32.510 --> 05:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
uh represent around thank you and thank
 
05:26:34.788 --> 05:26:34.798 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
 
05:26:36.590 --> 05:26:36.600 align:start position:0%
um we're in the middle of a housing
 
05:26:38.530 --> 05:26:38.540 align:start position:0%
crisis here in New Hampshire
 
05:26:43.310 --> 05:26:43.320 align:start position:0%
do homeless folks have the right to vote
 
05:26:45.410 --> 05:26:45.420 align:start position:0%
I believe that as long as they are
 
05:26:48.350 --> 05:26:48.360 align:start position:0%
residents of the state and that they are
 
05:26:50.750 --> 05:26:50.760 align:start position:0%
citizens of the US absolutely they have
 
05:26:52.970 --> 05:26:52.980 align:start position:0%
the right to vote Yes they should meet
 
05:26:54.590 --> 05:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
the four criteria but you know what the
 
05:26:56.810 --> 05:26:56.820 align:start position:0%
four criteria are thank you follow up
 
05:26:58.190 --> 05:26:58.200 align:start position:0%
please yep
 
05:26:58.200 --> 05:26:59.448 align:start position:0%
please yep
and

05:26:59.448 --> 05:26:59.458 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:27:03.230 --> 05:27:03.240 align:start position:0%
is it your interpretation of this bill
 
05:27:03.240 --> 05:27:05.810 align:start position:0%
is it your interpretation of this bill
that

05:27:05.810 --> 05:27:05.820 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:27:08.448 --> 05:27:08.458 align:start position:0%
someone who is currently without a home
 
05:27:11.208 --> 05:27:11.218 align:start position:0%
and without perhaps a legal address
 
05:27:14.090 --> 05:27:14.100 align:start position:0%
without a utility bill would this bill
 
05:27:17.330 --> 05:27:17.340 align:start position:0%
make it harder or easier for them to
 
05:27:17.340 --> 05:27:18.890 align:start position:0%
make it harder or easier for them to
vote

05:27:18.890 --> 05:27:18.900 align:start position:0%
vote
 
05:27:21.708 --> 05:27:21.718 align:start position:0%
I would expect that as long as the state
 
05:27:24.708 --> 05:27:24.718 align:start position:0%
is willing to provide them with a
 
05:27:26.208 --> 05:27:26.218 align:start position:0%
documentation that they are State
 
05:27:28.310 --> 05:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
residents it should be a very simple
 
05:27:30.410 --> 05:27:30.420 align:start position:0%
manner for them to provide that they are
 
05:27:32.208 --> 05:27:32.218 align:start position:0%
eligible to vote we already have statute
 
05:27:34.670 --> 05:27:34.680 align:start position:0%
that statutes that regulate you know how
 
05:27:36.610 --> 05:27:36.620 align:start position:0%
to handle people without a clear address
 
05:27:39.410 --> 05:27:39.420 align:start position:0%
and I would expect those to apply also I
 
05:27:40.670 --> 05:27:40.680 align:start position:0%
want to make it very clear and actually
 
05:27:42.050 --> 05:27:42.060 align:start position:0%
thank you for asking the question
 
05:27:44.030 --> 05:27:44.040 align:start position:0%
because I did forget to mention a very
 
05:27:45.470 --> 05:27:45.480 align:start position:0%
important point
 
05:27:47.990 --> 05:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
I would strengthen us strenuously argue
 
05:27:50.510 --> 05:27:50.520 align:start position:0%
that any ID that may be required to
 
05:27:53.150 --> 05:27:53.160 align:start position:0%
comply with this registration should not
 
05:27:56.090 --> 05:27:56.100 align:start position:0%
have any fear associated with it in this
 
05:27:57.770 --> 05:27:57.780 align:start position:0%
case a driver's license I would expect
 
05:27:59.750 --> 05:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
that you know the state would have to
 
05:28:01.910 --> 05:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
provide that for free because uh you
 
05:28:04.368 --> 05:28:04.378 align:start position:0%
know it's not okay to have any kind of
 
05:28:11.570 --> 05:28:11.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:14.090 --> 05:28:14.100 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
05:28:14.100 --> 05:28:15.948 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
representatively

05:28:15.948 --> 05:28:15.958 align:start position:0%
representatively
 
05:28:15.958 --> 05:28:16.850 align:start position:0%
representatively
um

05:28:16.850 --> 05:28:16.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:28:19.788 --> 05:28:19.798 align:start position:0%
with regard to your last comment thank
 
05:28:21.948 --> 05:28:21.958 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking
 
05:28:23.628 --> 05:28:23.638 align:start position:0%
the question
 
05:28:26.390 --> 05:28:26.400 align:start position:0%
um right now that is not the case the
 
05:28:29.150 --> 05:28:29.160 align:start position:0%
state does not provide that and homeless
 
05:28:32.150 --> 05:28:32.160 align:start position:0%
and low-income folks are most hurt by
 
05:28:35.510 --> 05:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
that they often cannot get to the city
 
05:28:37.730 --> 05:28:37.740 align:start position:0%
clerk's office or the Town Hall that's
 
05:28:39.948 --> 05:28:39.958 align:start position:0%
only open certain times because they're
 
05:28:41.690 --> 05:28:41.700 align:start position:0%
working two or three jobs
 
05:28:41.700 --> 05:28:44.330 align:start position:0%
working two or three jobs
so

05:28:44.330 --> 05:28:44.340 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:28:46.730 --> 05:28:46.740 align:start position:0%
when I read this bill and I know it's
 
05:28:49.010 --> 05:28:49.020 align:start position:0%
not your intent but does it not seem
 
05:28:51.708 --> 05:28:51.718 align:start position:0%
that you are excluding some people who
 
05:28:54.050 --> 05:28:54.060 align:start position:0%
cannot get that kind of ID
 
05:28:56.390 --> 05:28:56.400 align:start position:0%
who who do not have a lot of the
 
05:28:59.270 --> 05:28:59.280 align:start position:0%
Comforts that I have
 
05:29:02.150 --> 05:29:02.160 align:start position:0%
and we're excluding them from voting and
 
05:29:04.910 --> 05:29:04.920 align:start position:0%
is that worth it to exclude those folks
 
05:29:08.510 --> 05:29:08.520 align:start position:0%
in order to get this bill
 
05:29:10.788 --> 05:29:10.798 align:start position:0%
I really appreciate the question
 
05:29:13.430 --> 05:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
and first let me State for the record
 
05:29:16.070 --> 05:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
that absolutely it is not the intent of
 
05:29:18.590 --> 05:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
the bill to exclude anyone if somebody
 
05:29:20.690 --> 05:29:20.700 align:start position:0%
has legitimate
 
05:29:22.550 --> 05:29:22.560 align:start position:0%
difficulties complying with the
 
05:29:24.350 --> 05:29:24.360 align:start position:0%
requirements I would expect that between
 
05:29:27.530 --> 05:29:27.540 align:start position:0%
State support and you know town is
 
05:29:29.448 --> 05:29:29.458 align:start position:0%
offering support and Charities and
 
05:29:31.910 --> 05:29:31.920 align:start position:0%
everything we should be able to make
 
05:29:34.490 --> 05:29:34.500 align:start position:0%
everybody you know
 
05:29:36.830 --> 05:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
meet the requirements needed to register
 
05:29:39.350 --> 05:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
and vote the expenditures are not really
 
05:29:41.570 --> 05:29:41.580 align:start position:0%
material in any way shape or form we are
 
05:29:43.670 --> 05:29:43.680 align:start position:0%
just talking about speaking for my town
 
05:29:46.010 --> 05:29:46.020 align:start position:0%
which of course is one town in the state
 
05:29:47.810 --> 05:29:47.820 align:start position:0%
and the other towns are different but in
 
05:29:48.770 --> 05:29:48.780 align:start position:0%
my town
 
05:29:50.750 --> 05:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
the town will happily give you a ride
 
05:29:53.270 --> 05:29:53.280 align:start position:0%
you know if you're a senior or if you're
 
05:29:54.708 --> 05:29:54.718 align:start position:0%
a person who needs a ride there are
 
05:29:56.150 --> 05:29:56.160 align:start position:0%
progress where you can call and they
 
05:29:57.770 --> 05:29:57.780 align:start position:0%
will come and pick you up and drive you
 
05:30:00.288 --> 05:30:00.298 align:start position:0%
anywhere you can go to the town hall and
 
05:30:02.090 --> 05:30:02.100 align:start position:0%
get a piece of paper from the clerk
 
05:30:03.410 --> 05:30:03.420 align:start position:0%
saying that you cannot pay for your
 
05:30:05.448 --> 05:30:05.458 align:start position:0%
driver's license and the DMV will take
 
05:30:07.368 --> 05:30:07.378 align:start position:0%
care of that for you
 
05:30:10.128 --> 05:30:10.138 align:start position:0%
but again I I recognize that some people
 
05:30:12.470 --> 05:30:12.480 align:start position:0%
may have difficulty you know accessing
 
05:30:15.110 --> 05:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
those types of services this being said
 
05:30:16.970 --> 05:30:16.980 align:start position:0%
I think the way to address that which I
 
05:30:18.948 --> 05:30:18.958 align:start position:0%
would fully support you know legislative
 
05:30:21.170 --> 05:30:21.180 align:start position:0%
and personal is to make sure those
 
05:30:23.270 --> 05:30:23.280 align:start position:0%
services are provided rather than avoid
 
05:30:28.368 --> 05:30:28.378 align:start position:0%
passing you know this bill I you know
 
05:30:32.690 --> 05:30:32.700 align:start position:0%
I fully support making every effort to
 
05:30:36.110 --> 05:30:36.120 align:start position:0%
allow every person who is should be who
 
05:30:38.930 --> 05:30:38.940 align:start position:0%
is allowed to vote to vote
 
05:30:41.390 --> 05:30:41.400 align:start position:0%
I worked very hard for my right to vote
 
05:30:43.550 --> 05:30:43.560 align:start position:0%
I would never take it from anybody who's
 
05:30:46.670 --> 05:30:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:47.990 --> 05:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
some further questions from the
 
05:30:52.560 --> 05:30:52.570 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:52.570 --> 05:30:56.770 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

05:30:56.770 --> 05:30:56.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:00.530 --> 05:31:00.540 align:start position:0%
and has a terrific record of finding
 
05:31:04.250 --> 05:31:04.260 align:start position:0%
voters who have used the affidavits for
 
05:31:09.530 --> 05:31:09.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:11.690 --> 05:31:11.700 align:start position:0%
they honestly the only Dick Tracy that I
 
05:31:13.788 --> 05:31:13.798 align:start position:0%
know of is a fictional character so the
 
05:31:15.410 --> 05:31:15.420 align:start position:0%
answer to the first part of the question
 
05:31:17.448 --> 05:31:17.458 align:start position:0%
is no
 
05:31:20.930 --> 05:31:20.940 align:start position:0%
my concerns are
 
05:31:23.690 --> 05:31:23.700 align:start position:0%
that while Mr Tracy or his colleagues
 
05:31:26.270 --> 05:31:26.280 align:start position:0%
may do an exceptional job and I have no
 
05:31:28.010 --> 05:31:28.020 align:start position:0%
reason to question that
 
05:31:30.110 --> 05:31:30.120 align:start position:0%
I think those questions a lot of the
 
05:31:32.868 --> 05:31:32.878 align:start position:0%
times do not get asked because it's very
 
05:31:34.368 --> 05:31:34.378 align:start position:0%
hard for the supervisors of the
 
05:31:36.230 --> 05:31:36.240 align:start position:0%
checklist given the limited resources
 
05:31:38.690 --> 05:31:38.700 align:start position:0%
and time they have to even identify you
 
05:31:41.030 --> 05:31:41.040 align:start position:0%
know all the possible situations in
 
05:31:43.730 --> 05:31:43.740 align:start position:0%
which these things may happen it has
 
05:31:46.128 --> 05:31:46.138 align:start position:0%
been my experience in general that when
 
05:31:48.890 --> 05:31:48.900 align:start position:0%
instance is a potential voter fraud have
 
05:31:51.050 --> 05:31:51.060 align:start position:0%
been referred to the AG's office the
 
05:31:54.410 --> 05:31:54.420 align:start position:0%
answer the outcome of those referrals
 
05:31:57.890 --> 05:31:57.900 align:start position:0%
has been inconsistent as far as I would
 
05:31:59.628 --> 05:31:59.638 align:start position:0%
like to see it I'm aware of times when
 
05:32:01.310 --> 05:32:01.320 align:start position:0%
they didn't pursue things when I think
 
05:32:03.050 --> 05:32:03.060 align:start position:0%
they should have pursued them and I'm
 
05:32:04.910 --> 05:32:04.920 align:start position:0%
sure that they have pursued things that
 
05:32:06.530 --> 05:32:06.540 align:start position:0%
I don't know about where you know they
 
05:32:08.628 --> 05:32:08.638 align:start position:0%
also did a great job but
 
05:32:08.638 --> 05:32:10.550 align:start position:0%
also did a great job but
again

05:32:10.550 --> 05:32:10.560 align:start position:0%
again
 
05:32:13.430 --> 05:32:13.440 align:start position:0%
it's it's a concern when there is a
 
05:32:15.650 --> 05:32:15.660 align:start position:0%
gaping hole in our voting laws and by
 
05:32:18.708 --> 05:32:18.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:22.190 --> 05:32:22.200 align:start position:0%
I knocked on about 2 900 dollars to get
 
05:32:25.430 --> 05:32:25.440 align:start position:0%
elected to this 100 a year job
 
05:32:27.350 --> 05:32:27.360 align:start position:0%
and um
 
05:32:30.110 --> 05:32:30.120 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of people I spoke
 
05:32:32.690 --> 05:32:32.700 align:start position:0%
about and I brought up the voter ID laws
 
05:32:35.690 --> 05:32:35.700 align:start position:0%
we're not even aware that voter IDs are
 
05:32:38.270 --> 05:32:38.280 align:start position:0%
not mandatory already because every time
 
05:32:40.310 --> 05:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
they go to vote they get asked for their
 
05:32:43.310 --> 05:32:43.320 align:start position:0%
ID they provide it and that's it
 
05:32:45.288 --> 05:32:45.298 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of residents don't
 
05:32:48.050 --> 05:32:48.060 align:start position:0%
know about it and at least from the over
 
05:32:49.850 --> 05:32:49.860 align:start position:0%
a thousand people that actually opened
 
05:32:51.830 --> 05:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
the door and spoke with me the vast
 
05:32:54.650 --> 05:32:54.660 align:start position:0%
majority of them were in disbelief that
 
05:32:56.990 --> 05:32:57.000 align:start position:0%
this is allowed mind you I knocked on
 
05:32:58.970 --> 05:32:58.980 align:start position:0%
specific doors in town
 
05:33:00.830 --> 05:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
other doors may have gotten different
 
05:33:04.850 --> 05:33:04.860 align:start position:0%
answers but I literally had two people
 
05:33:06.650 --> 05:33:06.660 align:start position:0%
who said I cannot support you because
 
05:33:11.570 --> 05:33:11.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:13.310 --> 05:33:13.320 align:start position:0%
president Brennan
 
05:33:14.810 --> 05:33:14.820 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
05:33:14.820 --> 05:33:16.190 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
question

05:33:16.190 --> 05:33:16.200 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:33:17.868 --> 05:33:17.878 align:start position:0%
um representative Lynn who's introduced
 
05:33:20.990 --> 05:33:21.000 align:start position:0%
the bill was unaware of how many
 
05:33:21.000 --> 05:33:23.990 align:start position:0%
the bill was unaware of how many
affidavit

05:33:23.990 --> 05:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
affidavit
 
05:33:24.000 --> 05:33:24.788 align:start position:0%
affidavit
um

05:33:24.788 --> 05:33:24.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:33:27.310 --> 05:33:27.320 align:start position:0%
affidavits had not been
 
05:33:30.708 --> 05:33:30.718 align:start position:0%
cured by the AG's office are you aware
 
05:33:34.368 --> 05:33:34.378 align:start position:0%
of how many outstanding affidavits are
 
05:33:37.970 --> 05:33:37.980 align:start position:0%
flying in unknown territory
 
05:33:37.980 --> 05:33:40.310 align:start position:0%
flying in unknown territory
no

05:33:40.310 --> 05:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
no
 
05:33:41.810 --> 05:33:41.820 align:start position:0%
follow-up please
 
05:33:41.820 --> 05:33:43.070 align:start position:0%
follow-up please
yes

05:33:43.070 --> 05:33:43.080 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:33:43.080 --> 05:33:44.810 align:start position:0%
yes
so

05:33:44.810 --> 05:33:44.820 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:33:46.730 --> 05:33:46.740 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
05:33:49.910 --> 05:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
would be attempting to solve a problem
 
05:33:53.930 --> 05:33:53.940 align:start position:0%
that we don't really know is
 
05:33:56.390 --> 05:33:56.400 align:start position:0%
an issue
 
05:33:58.490 --> 05:33:58.500 align:start position:0%
of course we know it's an issue we just
 
05:34:00.590 --> 05:34:00.600 align:start position:0%
don't know how big necessarily
 
05:34:02.090 --> 05:34:02.100 align:start position:0%
I agree
 
05:34:04.550 --> 05:34:04.560 align:start position:0%
and I conceded from the beginning that
 
05:34:07.190 --> 05:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
the way system is set up it is very hard
 
05:34:09.890 --> 05:34:09.900 align:start position:0%
to measure what the impact is because of
 
05:34:12.170 --> 05:34:12.180 align:start position:0%
just the nature of you know people
 
05:34:14.990 --> 05:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
without an ID you know disappearing into
 
05:34:18.770 --> 05:34:18.780 align:start position:0%
the night and good luck finding them
 
05:34:20.868 --> 05:34:20.878 align:start position:0%
the other thing that I would submit for
 
05:34:23.270 --> 05:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
your consideration is that
 
05:34:26.270 --> 05:34:26.280 align:start position:0%
we fix laws not only because they get
 
05:34:28.788 --> 05:34:28.798 align:start position:0%
grievously abused but it also because
 
05:34:31.190 --> 05:34:31.200 align:start position:0%
there is the potential for future abuse
 
05:34:33.410 --> 05:34:33.420 align:start position:0%
or you know increased abuse in the
 
05:34:36.830 --> 05:34:36.840 align:start position:0%
future do we wait until you know
 
05:34:39.410 --> 05:34:39.420 align:start position:0%
it's terrible until we fixed what I
 
05:34:41.570 --> 05:34:41.580 align:start position:0%
believe to be an obvious problem I don't
 
05:34:43.850 --> 05:34:43.860 align:start position:0%
think that's the right approach but I do
 
05:34:46.128 --> 05:34:46.138 align:start position:0%
agree that you know it is absolutely
 
05:34:48.410 --> 05:34:48.420 align:start position:0%
difficult to measure the scope of this
 
05:34:48.420 --> 05:34:50.990 align:start position:0%
difficult to measure the scope of this
yes

05:34:50.990 --> 05:34:51.000 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:34:53.510 --> 05:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
further questions all right sing them
 
05:34:54.708 --> 05:34:54.718 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:34:55.670 --> 05:34:55.680 align:start position:0%
um thank you no other state
 
05:34:56.810 --> 05:34:56.820 align:start position:0%
representatives are signed up to speak
 
05:34:59.510 --> 05:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
so we're going on to the citizenry uh
 
05:35:02.150 --> 05:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
first up is Curtis register from Durham
 
05:35:04.610 --> 05:35:04.620 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
05:35:04.620 --> 05:35:33.590 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
no

05:35:33.590 --> 05:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:35.448 --> 05:35:35.458 align:start position:0%
good afternoon make sure you press the
 
05:35:37.070 --> 05:35:37.080 align:start position:0%
button right in front of you
 
05:35:38.510 --> 05:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
there you go
 
05:35:40.430 --> 05:35:40.440 align:start position:0%
good afternoon honorable members of the
 
05:35:42.708 --> 05:35:42.718 align:start position:0%
election uh law committee I'm very
 
05:35:44.270 --> 05:35:44.280 align:start position:0%
honored to be here and I'm very grateful
 
05:35:46.670 --> 05:35:46.680 align:start position:0%
to have the moment to speak with you my
 
05:35:48.948 --> 05:35:48.958 align:start position:0%
name is Curtis register this is Lord
 
05:35:50.930 --> 05:35:50.940 align:start position:0%
Remington register he's the more
 
05:35:52.910 --> 05:35:52.920 align:start position:0%
important member of uh this discussion
 
05:35:55.730 --> 05:35:55.740 align:start position:0%
but we are both residents of Durham New
 
05:35:58.430 --> 05:35:58.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh and I stand in steadfast
 
05:36:07.490 --> 05:36:07.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:09.410 --> 05:36:09.420 align:start position:0%
this is the bill that seeks to solve a
 
05:36:11.090 --> 05:36:11.100 align:start position:0%
problem that doesn't exist
 
05:36:13.610 --> 05:36:13.620 align:start position:0%
especially in New Hampshire
 
05:36:15.590 --> 05:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
and it adds obstacles to voters without
 
05:36:20.090 --> 05:36:20.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:22.030 --> 05:36:22.040 align:start position:0%
investigative journalists from AP
 
05:36:24.948 --> 05:36:24.958 align:start position:0%
Washington Post and then reinforced by
 
05:36:26.510 --> 05:36:26.520 align:start position:0%
the ACLU
 
05:36:27.948 --> 05:36:27.958 align:start position:0%
went through a comprehensive
 
05:36:31.730 --> 05:36:31.740 align:start position:0%
investigation and reviewed 22 years of
 
05:36:33.110 --> 05:36:33.120 align:start position:0%
voting history in the United States
 
05:36:36.470 --> 05:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
national elections and found 500 cases
 
05:36:39.890 --> 05:36:39.900 align:start position:0%
of voter fraud that were credible in 500
 
05:36:43.490 --> 05:36:43.500 align:start position:0%
years even or in 22 years even less than
 
05:36:43.500 --> 05:36:45.050 align:start position:0%
years even or in 22 years even less than
500

05:36:45.050 --> 05:36:45.060 align:start position:0%
500
 
05:36:49.490 --> 05:36:49.500 align:start position:0%
were actually convicted with evidence
 
05:36:53.390 --> 05:36:53.400 align:start position:0%
in contrast voter ID laws Across the
 
05:36:55.788 --> 05:36:55.798 align:start position:0%
Nation that has become a nice Trend uh
 
05:36:58.788 --> 05:36:58.798 align:start position:0%
have thrown out thousands of votes each
 
05:37:01.788 --> 05:37:01.798 align:start position:0%
election with a fantastic grand total
 
05:37:03.230 --> 05:37:03.240 align:start position:0%
coming out of our favorite state of
 
05:37:05.690 --> 05:37:05.700 align:start position:0%
Texas of a whopping 18
 
05:37:10.670 --> 05:37:10.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:13.190 --> 05:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
in addition to voter ID laws coming from
 
05:37:15.770 --> 05:37:15.780 align:start position:0%
a legacy of voter suppression and racism
 
05:37:19.128 --> 05:37:19.138 align:start position:0%
which can be found with research in the
 
05:37:25.128 --> 05:37:25.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:27.890 --> 05:37:27.900 align:start position:0%
and from many law professors from many
 
05:37:29.868 --> 05:37:29.878 align:start position:0%
universities to include Harvard
 
05:37:32.390 --> 05:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
with many working deliberately to
 
05:37:35.868 --> 05:37:35.878 align:start position:0%
alienate and refute minority votes
 
05:37:38.090 --> 05:37:38.100 align:start position:0%
there is a cost associated with voter ID
 
05:37:38.100 --> 05:37:39.288 align:start position:0%
there is a cost associated with voter ID
laws

05:37:39.288 --> 05:37:39.298 align:start position:0%
laws
 
05:37:41.690 --> 05:37:41.700 align:start position:0%
not just the cost that's incurred by the
 
05:37:43.610 --> 05:37:43.620 align:start position:0%
individual that has to go and get an ID
 
05:37:45.350 --> 05:37:45.360 align:start position:0%
and go through all the logistics of
 
05:37:47.270 --> 05:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
making sure their paperwork is in a row
 
05:37:48.770 --> 05:37:48.780 align:start position:0%
so the individual doesn't turn them away
 
05:37:51.170 --> 05:37:51.180 align:start position:0%
at the desk as the cost incurred by the
 
05:37:51.180 --> 05:37:52.190 align:start position:0%
at the desk as the cost incurred by the
state

05:37:52.190 --> 05:37:52.200 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:37:55.610 --> 05:37:55.620 align:start position:0%
I see on the on the hb460 that we did a
 
05:37:58.010 --> 05:37:58.020 align:start position:0%
nice uh Financial worksheet here
 
05:38:02.050 --> 05:38:02.060 align:start position:0%
that has fiscal years 23 24 and 25
 
05:38:06.050 --> 05:38:06.060 align:start position:0%
coming out at a a boon for the budget of
 
05:38:09.470 --> 05:38:09.480 align:start position:0%
a couple hundred thousand dollars
 
05:38:12.708 --> 05:38:12.718 align:start position:0%
Texas when they implemented theirs back
 
05:38:14.330 --> 05:38:14.340 align:start position:0%
in 2015
 
05:38:17.810 --> 05:38:17.820 align:start position:0%
had to pay up to 2 million dollars
 
05:38:19.910 --> 05:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
in education
 
05:38:21.530 --> 05:38:21.540 align:start position:0%
and in training for their election
 
05:38:21.540 --> 05:38:22.670 align:start position:0%
and in training for their election
workers

05:38:22.670 --> 05:38:22.680 align:start position:0%
workers
 
05:38:24.948 --> 05:38:24.958 align:start position:0%
and that's without giving them IDs to
 
05:38:26.570 --> 05:38:26.580 align:start position:0%
their voters
 
05:38:26.580 --> 05:38:28.490 align:start position:0%
their voters
Indiana

05:38:28.490 --> 05:38:28.500 align:start position:0%
Indiana
 
05:38:31.250 --> 05:38:31.260 align:start position:0%
in 2014 when they also put their voter
 
05:38:33.830 --> 05:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
ID law into effect had to give 10
 
05:38:35.510 --> 05:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
05:38:37.490 --> 05:38:37.500 align:start position:0%
and training
 
05:38:41.208 --> 05:38:41.218 align:start position:0%
election day training and education as
 
05:38:43.128 --> 05:38:43.138 align:start position:0%
well as funding
 
05:38:45.948 --> 05:38:45.958 align:start position:0%
licenses to uh the citizens that need to
 
05:38:49.550 --> 05:38:49.560 align:start position:0%
vote and this is all online ACLU is what
 
05:38:52.730 --> 05:38:52.740 align:start position:0%
I use to find the sources that link to
 
05:38:57.530 --> 05:38:57.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:58.970 --> 05:38:58.980 align:start position:0%
but this is a lot of costs that's
 
05:38:58.980 --> 05:39:00.110 align:start position:0%
but this is a lot of costs that's
incurred

05:39:00.110 --> 05:39:00.120 align:start position:0%
incurred
 
05:39:02.150 --> 05:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
for a citizen to be able to execut
 
05:39:09.050 --> 05:39:09.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:10.970 --> 05:39:10.980 align:start position:0%
this does the opposite of increasing
 
05:39:12.350 --> 05:39:12.360 align:start position:0%
voter confidence
 
05:39:16.128 --> 05:39:16.138 align:start position:0%
it adds a variable of uncertainty
 
05:39:18.830 --> 05:39:18.840 align:start position:0%
of if the form of identification is
 
05:39:21.288 --> 05:39:21.298 align:start position:0%
going to be accepted if the voter
 
05:39:23.570 --> 05:39:23.580 align:start position:0%
registration went through or is up to
 
05:39:25.430 --> 05:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
date I myself have experienced
 
05:39:28.550 --> 05:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
uncertainty and I'm as uh you know like
 
05:39:31.128 --> 05:39:31.138 align:start position:0%
of means and capable of getting an ID as
 
05:39:34.250 --> 05:39:34.260 align:start position:0%
anybody else and it was still fairly
 
05:39:35.990 --> 05:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
nerve-wracking to go and get registered
 
05:39:39.650 --> 05:39:39.660 align:start position:0%
to vote because you have you worry
 
05:39:41.270 --> 05:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
you're concerned that your vote's not
 
05:39:44.990 --> 05:39:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:47.628 --> 05:39:47.638 align:start position:0%
it opens the door for more Extreme
 
05:39:50.628 --> 05:39:50.638 align:start position:0%
Measures for voter suppression
 
05:39:53.208 --> 05:39:53.218 align:start position:0%
voter ID laws are a current Trend but
 
05:39:55.610 --> 05:39:55.620 align:start position:0%
they're not new they've been around for
 
05:39:57.230 --> 05:39:57.240 align:start position:0%
a very long time
 
05:39:59.510 --> 05:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
and voter ID laws happen to end up being
 
05:40:01.010 --> 05:40:01.020 align:start position:0%
a gateway drug
 
05:40:03.708 --> 05:40:03.718 align:start position:0%
to more extreme forms of voter
 
05:40:03.718 --> 05:40:04.970 align:start position:0%
to more extreme forms of voter
suppression

05:40:04.970 --> 05:40:04.980 align:start position:0%
suppression
 
05:40:08.090 --> 05:40:08.100 align:start position:0%
and now we've seen some measures back in
 
05:40:10.490 --> 05:40:10.500 align:start position:0%
1966 you have the Harper V Board of
 
05:40:12.650 --> 05:40:12.660 align:start position:0%
Virginia Board of Education incurring
 
05:40:14.510 --> 05:40:14.520 align:start position:0%
that the 14th Amendment invokes no poll
 
05:40:18.410 --> 05:40:18.420 align:start position:0%
tax though this is not a direct poll tax
 
05:40:22.368 --> 05:40:22.378 align:start position:0%
it ties up under an indirect poll tax
 
05:40:24.050 --> 05:40:24.060 align:start position:0%
just as awareness you have about 30
 
05:40:26.330 --> 05:40:26.340 align:start position:0%
seconds left sir Roger that there are
 
05:40:28.310 --> 05:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
ways to shore up our already secure
 
05:40:30.530 --> 05:40:30.540 align:start position:0%
elections the New Hampshire campaign for
 
05:40:33.050 --> 05:40:33.060 align:start position:0%
voting rights has put out information to
 
05:40:35.390 --> 05:40:35.400 align:start position:0%
push out there as well as the Secretary
 
05:40:37.070 --> 05:40:37.080 align:start position:0%
of State of New Hampshire who had their
 
05:40:39.590 --> 05:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
special session on voter confidence that
 
05:40:41.868 --> 05:40:41.878 align:start position:0%
listed a whole Myriad of fantastic ideas
 
05:40:44.170 --> 05:40:44.180 align:start position:0%
to include
 
05:40:47.050 --> 05:40:47.060 align:start position:0%
updating modernizing election equipment
 
05:40:49.550 --> 05:40:49.560 align:start position:0%
respecting our election officials paying
 
05:40:51.470 --> 05:40:51.480 align:start position:0%
them what they're worth and helping
 
05:40:54.170 --> 05:40:54.180 align:start position:0%
support them when controversy arises
 
05:40:57.110 --> 05:40:57.120 align:start position:0%
as well as post-selection audits we've
 
05:40:59.628 --> 05:40:59.638 align:start position:0%
heard the sponsors today
 
05:41:01.610 --> 05:41:01.620 align:start position:0%
there is no data to support this bill
 
05:41:03.890 --> 05:41:03.900 align:start position:0%
from their own mouths
 
05:41:06.650 --> 05:41:06.660 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire elections are safe this
 
05:41:10.970 --> 05:41:10.980 align:start position:0%
bill solves nothing vote down HB 460.
 
05:41:12.650 --> 05:41:12.660 align:start position:0%
thank you very much will you be taking
 
05:41:14.390 --> 05:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
questions I will take whatever questions
 
05:41:15.470 --> 05:41:15.480 align:start position:0%
you want to throw at me yes
 
05:41:17.090 --> 05:41:17.100 align:start position:0%

coming and sharing your testimony today
 
05:41:22.128 --> 05:41:22.138 align:start position:0%
I was wondering if you could elaborate a
 
05:41:24.708 --> 05:41:24.718 align:start position:0%
little bit further on some of the uh
 
05:41:28.010 --> 05:41:28.020 align:start position:0%
laws that you kind of described or uh
 
05:41:30.170 --> 05:41:30.180 align:start position:0%
not necessarily described but alluded to
 
05:41:32.810 --> 05:41:32.820 align:start position:0%
in uh in your previous statement so
 
05:41:35.030 --> 05:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
Texas implemented a voter ID law that
 
05:41:38.270 --> 05:41:38.280 align:start position:0%
was photo ID only in 2015 Indiana did
 
05:41:41.390 --> 05:41:41.400 align:start position:0%
something similar uh outside of the
 
05:41:43.310 --> 05:41:43.320 align:start position:0%
Google machine I can't give you any more
 
05:41:44.990 --> 05:41:45.000 align:start position:0%
than that
 
05:41:47.270 --> 05:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
yeah further questions from the
 
05:41:49.010 --> 05:41:49.020 align:start position:0%

uh do you have any documented cases of
 
05:41:56.330 --> 05:41:56.340 align:start position:0%
voter suppression
 
05:41:59.330 --> 05:41:59.340 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire negative
 
05:42:01.430 --> 05:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:42:03.350 --> 05:42:03.360 align:start position:0%

05:42:34.310 --> 05:42:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:36.050 --> 05:42:36.060 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
 
05:42:38.628 --> 05:42:38.638 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and members of house election
 
05:42:41.330 --> 05:42:41.340 align:start position:0%
law committee my name is Linda Bundy and
 
05:42:43.128 --> 05:42:43.138 align:start position:0%
I'm from Antrim
 
05:42:47.150 --> 05:42:47.160 align:start position:0%
I oppose HB 460 relative to eliminating
 
05:42:50.810 --> 05:42:50.820 align:start position:0%
voter identification ex exceptions
 
05:42:53.448 --> 05:42:53.458 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire elections are safe and
 
05:42:53.458 --> 05:42:54.470 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire elections are safe and
secure

05:42:54.470 --> 05:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
secure
 
05:42:56.810 --> 05:42:56.820 align:start position:0%
confirmed by bipartisan leaders
 
05:43:00.650 --> 05:43:00.660 align:start position:0%
committees and members of the public
 
05:43:03.050 --> 05:43:03.060 align:start position:0%
this bill eliminates a legitimate
 
05:43:05.868 --> 05:43:05.878 align:start position:0%
process for voters who either don't have
 
05:43:08.270 --> 05:43:08.280 align:start position:0%
or have forgotten documents needed to
 
05:43:11.570 --> 05:43:11.580 align:start position:0%
register by repealing the rsas governing
 
05:43:13.310 --> 05:43:13.320 align:start position:0%
the use of the challenged voter
 
05:43:13.320 --> 05:43:15.110 align:start position:0%
the use of the challenged voter
affidavit

05:43:15.110 --> 05:43:15.120 align:start position:0%
affidavit
 
05:43:18.890 --> 05:43:18.900 align:start position:0%
an affidavit is a serious legal document
 
05:43:21.948 --> 05:43:21.958 align:start position:0%
when voters sign affidavits they are
 
05:43:24.708 --> 05:43:24.718 align:start position:0%
swearing and affirming the truth of
 
05:43:26.330 --> 05:43:26.340 align:start position:0%
their statements
 
05:43:28.368 --> 05:43:28.378 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Office of the Attorney
 
05:43:31.910 --> 05:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
General checks all affidavits to verify
 
05:43:35.448 --> 05:43:35.458 align:start position:0%
voters identities conviction of lying on
 
05:43:38.390 --> 05:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
an affidavit results in a fine of up to
 
05:43:40.550 --> 05:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
five thousand dollars and up to one year
 
05:43:42.590 --> 05:43:42.600 align:start position:0%
in jail
 
05:43:45.470 --> 05:43:45.480 align:start position:0%
removing exceptions for proving voter
 
05:43:48.890 --> 05:43:48.900 align:start position:0%
identification and voter affidavits as
 
05:43:52.190 --> 05:43:52.200 align:start position:0%
proof of identification makes this bill
 
05:43:54.948 --> 05:43:54.958 align:start position:0%
a form of voter suppression
 
05:43:57.230 --> 05:43:57.240 align:start position:0%
the groups of Voters most of most
 
05:44:00.230 --> 05:44:00.240 align:start position:0%
affected by this are the elderly new
 
05:44:04.030 --> 05:44:04.040 align:start position:0%
Americans and houseless individuals
 
05:44:06.890 --> 05:44:06.900 align:start position:0%
affidavits have been proven to be a safe
 
05:44:09.830 --> 05:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
and secure way for voters to exercise
 
05:44:12.770 --> 05:44:12.780 align:start position:0%
their right to cast a ballot
 
05:44:15.708 --> 05:44:15.718 align:start position:0%
election Integrity relies on all
 
05:44:18.170 --> 05:44:18.180 align:start position:0%
qualified voters being able to
 
05:44:20.570 --> 05:44:20.580 align:start position:0%
participate in the process
 
05:44:24.110 --> 05:44:24.120 align:start position:0%
limiting access to the vote weakens our
 
05:44:24.120 --> 05:44:25.788 align:start position:0%
limiting access to the vote weakens our
democracy

05:44:25.788 --> 05:44:25.798 align:start position:0%
democracy
 
05:44:28.128 --> 05:44:28.138 align:start position:0%
I ask that you vote in expedient to
 
05:44:31.250 --> 05:44:31.260 align:start position:0%
legislate on HB 460.
 
05:44:33.830 --> 05:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for this opportunity to speak
 
05:44:36.048 --> 05:44:36.058 align:start position:0%
excellent will you be taking questions
 
05:44:38.510 --> 05:44:38.520 align:start position:0%
no thank you all right next up is
 
05:44:41.510 --> 05:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
Elizabeth Corell
 
05:44:41.520 --> 05:44:54.830 align:start position:0%
Elizabeth Corell
okay

05:44:54.830 --> 05:44:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:56.628 --> 05:44:56.638 align:start position:0%
uh you turned it off so hit it again
 
05:44:58.430 --> 05:44:58.440 align:start position:0%
there you go thank you Mr chairman and
 
05:45:00.230 --> 05:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
05:45:02.830 --> 05:45:02.840 align:start position:0%
Elizabeth Carrell I live here in Concord
 
05:45:05.990 --> 05:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
and I sit before you because I serve as
 
05:45:08.330 --> 05:45:08.340 align:start position:0%
a supervisor of the checklist so I can
 
05:45:11.510 --> 05:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
just um share some of my observations
 
05:45:14.708 --> 05:45:14.718 align:start position:0%
and experiences in that capacity
 
05:45:18.470 --> 05:45:18.480 align:start position:0%
generally I oppose this idea because I
 
05:45:20.690 --> 05:45:20.700 align:start position:0%
think there are many messages we've
 
05:45:24.230 --> 05:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
received over a long-term period of time
 
05:45:26.330 --> 05:45:26.340 align:start position:0%
now I have been serving more than a
 
05:45:28.070 --> 05:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
Dozen Years
 
05:45:28.080 --> 05:45:28.850 align:start position:0%
Dozen Years
um

05:45:28.850 --> 05:45:28.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:45:31.548 --> 05:45:31.558 align:start position:0%
for many quarters but I'm thinking about
 
05:45:34.128 --> 05:45:34.138 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State in particular
 
05:45:36.830 --> 05:45:36.840 align:start position:0%
for probably the last four years they
 
05:45:38.930 --> 05:45:38.940 align:start position:0%
have really impressed upon us as
 
05:45:42.590 --> 05:45:42.600 align:start position:0%
supervisors do not send voters away when
 
05:45:45.048 --> 05:45:45.058 align:start position:0%
they don't have the right documentation
 
05:45:47.510 --> 05:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
there was a time when we might say well
 
05:45:49.070 --> 05:45:49.080 align:start position:0%
do you have something in your car do you
 
05:45:50.810 --> 05:45:50.820 align:start position:0%
have your car registration
 
05:45:52.970 --> 05:45:52.980 align:start position:0%
why don't you go out and get it kind of
 
05:45:55.490 --> 05:45:55.500 align:start position:0%
thing we are not supposed to be doing
 
05:45:58.190 --> 05:45:58.200 align:start position:0%
that much more recently they've been
 
05:46:01.070 --> 05:46:01.080 align:start position:0%
saying don't send them away have them do
 
05:46:03.110 --> 05:46:03.120 align:start position:0%
the paperwork if you send them away they
 
05:46:05.690 --> 05:46:05.700 align:start position:0%
may not come back and the message there
 
05:46:09.288 --> 05:46:09.298 align:start position:0%
has been consistent we want them to vote
 
05:46:12.048 --> 05:46:12.058 align:start position:0%
we don't want to present obstacles now
 
05:46:14.208 --> 05:46:14.218 align:start position:0%
I'm talking about all the varieties of
 
05:46:14.218 --> 05:46:15.650 align:start position:0%
I'm talking about all the varieties of
affidavits

05:46:15.650 --> 05:46:15.660 align:start position:0%
affidavits
 
05:46:18.288 --> 05:46:18.298 align:start position:0%
very often someone will come in and they
 
05:46:20.448 --> 05:46:20.458 align:start position:0%
think they have what they need
 
05:46:23.690 --> 05:46:23.700 align:start position:0%
um they've in cases they've voted before
 
05:46:25.850 --> 05:46:25.860 align:start position:0%
they just haven't necessarily voted
 
05:46:27.948 --> 05:46:27.958 align:start position:0%
where they are you know whether they're
 
05:46:30.530 --> 05:46:30.540 align:start position:0%
coming from out of state or from another
 
05:46:32.750 --> 05:46:32.760 align:start position:0%
part of the state
 
05:46:35.270 --> 05:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
the other factor that I would raise to
 
05:46:37.970 --> 05:46:37.980 align:start position:0%
you and perhaps to one or more of our
 
05:46:41.930 --> 05:46:41.940 align:start position:0%
sponsors is we'll value voting but we
 
05:46:43.910 --> 05:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
don't all think about it the way you and
 
05:46:46.548 --> 05:46:46.558 align:start position:0%
I sitting around these tables do a lot
 
05:46:49.788 --> 05:46:49.798 align:start position:0%
of people participate in the even year
 
05:46:52.730 --> 05:46:52.740 align:start position:0%
elections we know voter turnout is huge
 
05:46:54.410 --> 05:46:54.420 align:start position:0%
for a presidential
 
05:46:57.410 --> 05:46:57.420 align:start position:0%
it's pretty high for the state elections
 
05:46:59.810 --> 05:46:59.820 align:start position:0%
and pretty low for the municipal
 
05:47:02.628 --> 05:47:02.638 align:start position:0%
especially if you're a city as opposed
 
05:47:04.010 --> 05:47:04.020 align:start position:0%
to a town
 
05:47:06.650 --> 05:47:06.660 align:start position:0%
the average person isn't tuned into the
 
05:47:09.110 --> 05:47:09.120 align:start position:0%
it the way you and I are if they're
 
05:47:10.250 --> 05:47:10.260 align:start position:0%
going to vote and they're not going to
 
05:47:11.810 --> 05:47:11.820 align:start position:0%
think about what does it take to vote
 
05:47:13.010 --> 05:47:13.020 align:start position:0%
they're thinking about who are they
 
05:47:14.448 --> 05:47:14.458 align:start position:0%
going to vote for
 
05:47:16.368 --> 05:47:16.378 align:start position:0%
and they know what time they're going to
 
05:47:18.530 --> 05:47:18.540 align:start position:0%
vote often you know you have the early
 
05:47:20.628 --> 05:47:20.638 align:start position:0%
comers who do it before work but you
 
05:47:22.970 --> 05:47:22.980 align:start position:0%
have a lot of people ask anybody who
 
05:47:24.890 --> 05:47:24.900 align:start position:0%
works at the polls who come in after
 
05:47:24.900 --> 05:47:25.970 align:start position:0%
works at the polls who come in after
work

05:47:25.970 --> 05:47:25.980 align:start position:0%
work
 
05:47:28.610 --> 05:47:28.620 align:start position:0%
and after work varies depending on where
 
05:47:31.310 --> 05:47:31.320 align:start position:0%
they live they may be coming in at 6 15
 
05:47:33.470 --> 05:47:33.480 align:start position:0%
because they're coming from out of town
 
05:47:36.470 --> 05:47:36.480 align:start position:0%
they work out of town they're in a rush
 
05:47:39.048 --> 05:47:39.058 align:start position:0%
you tell that person they don't have the
 
05:47:41.810 --> 05:47:41.820 align:start position:0%
right thing and they don't have the
 
05:47:44.510 --> 05:47:44.520 align:start position:0%
option now you might say well why don't
 
05:47:47.390 --> 05:47:47.400 align:start position:0%
they know what the problem is they've
 
05:47:49.490 --> 05:47:49.500 align:start position:0%
voted so many times
 
05:47:51.410 --> 05:47:51.420 align:start position:0%
well let me remind you we've just been
 
05:47:53.030 --> 05:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
through a census
 
05:47:56.810 --> 05:47:56.820 align:start position:0%
in my ward so I'm in Ward 5 and Concord
 
05:47:59.750 --> 05:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
we used to operate right behind City
 
05:47:59.760 --> 05:48:00.590 align:start position:0%
we used to operate right behind City
Hall

05:48:00.590 --> 05:48:00.600 align:start position:0%
Hall
 
05:48:03.890 --> 05:48:03.900 align:start position:0%
my ward location changed how many people
 
05:48:07.070 --> 05:48:07.080 align:start position:0%
came in the door of our Ward
 
05:48:08.990 --> 05:48:09.000 align:start position:0%
for that election
 
05:48:11.390 --> 05:48:11.400 align:start position:0%
and they came to the wrong place so
 
05:48:12.770 --> 05:48:12.780 align:start position:0%
first of all they're in the wrong place
 
05:48:15.650 --> 05:48:15.660 align:start position:0%
now they have to get over the other site
 
05:48:17.868 --> 05:48:17.878 align:start position:0%
and we have to make sure they know where
 
05:48:20.330 --> 05:48:20.340 align:start position:0%
that is because there's been a Juggle
 
05:48:22.310 --> 05:48:22.320 align:start position:0%
that's a result of the census
 
05:48:24.410 --> 05:48:24.420 align:start position:0%
and the result of the decision the city
 
05:48:26.990 --> 05:48:27.000 align:start position:0%
made about where the sites would be
 
05:48:28.610 --> 05:48:28.620 align:start position:0%
that has nothing to do with their
 
05:48:31.128 --> 05:48:31.138 align:start position:0%
ability to vote the census created
 
05:48:33.948 --> 05:48:33.958 align:start position:0%
another challenge some people got
 
05:48:33.958 --> 05:48:35.090 align:start position:0%
another challenge some people got
dropped

05:48:35.090 --> 05:48:35.100 align:start position:0%
dropped
 
05:48:40.070 --> 05:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
and try as any City Hall might mistakes
 
05:48:42.548 --> 05:48:42.558 align:start position:0%
are made
 
05:48:46.190 --> 05:48:46.200 align:start position:0%
we had voters who have always voted in
 
05:48:49.490 --> 05:48:49.500 align:start position:0%
the same ward and two elections in a row
 
05:48:51.830 --> 05:48:51.840 align:start position:0%
their name's not on the list now try
 
05:48:54.048 --> 05:48:54.058 align:start position:0%
telling them they don't have the right
 
05:48:56.930 --> 05:48:56.940 align:start position:0%
documentation to vote I mean really if
 
05:48:58.850 --> 05:48:58.860 align:start position:0%
you want to see anger that's where
 
05:49:00.470 --> 05:49:00.480 align:start position:0%
you're going to see it because they're
 
05:49:03.048 --> 05:49:03.058 align:start position:0%
the ones who have always voted and
 
05:49:05.390 --> 05:49:05.400 align:start position:0%
they've always shown up at what they
 
05:49:07.430 --> 05:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
understood to be the right place and now
 
05:49:10.610 --> 05:49:10.620 align:start position:0%
they're being told nah you can't do it
 
05:49:13.368 --> 05:49:13.378 align:start position:0%
I I think the underlying message that I
 
05:49:16.910 --> 05:49:16.920 align:start position:0%
would share though is as supervisors as
 
05:49:20.090 --> 05:49:20.100 align:start position:0%
moderator clerk the whole Spectrum we're
 
05:49:23.390 --> 05:49:23.400 align:start position:0%
there to serve and we've been told we're
 
05:49:26.868 --> 05:49:26.878 align:start position:0%
here to help enable people to vote don't
 
05:49:29.628 --> 05:49:29.638 align:start position:0%
create obstacles try to help them
 
05:49:31.548 --> 05:49:31.558 align:start position:0%
achieve this
 
05:49:34.670 --> 05:49:34.680 align:start position:0%
and with that I think setting in rules
 
05:49:37.490 --> 05:49:37.500 align:start position:0%
like this do just the opposite so I
 
05:49:39.110 --> 05:49:39.120 align:start position:0%
would suggest you oppose this
 
05:49:39.120 --> 05:49:40.490 align:start position:0%
would suggest you oppose this
legislation

05:49:40.490 --> 05:49:40.500 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
05:49:43.070 --> 05:49:43.080 align:start position:0%
okay will you be taking questions yes
 
05:49:44.448 --> 05:49:44.458 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
 
05:49:44.458 --> 05:49:45.890 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
committee

05:49:45.890 --> 05:49:45.900 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:49:48.350 --> 05:49:48.360 align:start position:0%
oh yes uh representative Brennan thank
 
05:49:52.670 --> 05:49:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:54.650 --> 05:49:54.660 align:start position:0%
it's voting right
 
05:49:57.650 --> 05:49:57.660 align:start position:0%
or a privilege
 
05:50:01.430 --> 05:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
well in my opinion it's a right uh that
 
05:50:03.890 --> 05:50:03.900 align:start position:0%
you can exercise
 
05:50:03.900 --> 05:50:04.548 align:start position:0%
you can exercise
um

05:50:04.548 --> 05:50:04.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:50:07.010 --> 05:50:07.020 align:start position:0%
as a citizen of the country
 
05:50:09.530 --> 05:50:09.540 align:start position:0%
follow-up please yes
 
05:50:12.170 --> 05:50:12.180 align:start position:0%
does this bill make it
 
05:50:16.910 --> 05:50:16.920 align:start position:0%
easier or more difficult to exercise the
 
05:50:18.288 --> 05:50:18.298 align:start position:0%
right to vote
 
05:50:20.448 --> 05:50:20.458 align:start position:0%
it's putting some obstacles in the way
 
05:50:22.610 --> 05:50:22.620 align:start position:0%
of some people who should be able to
 
05:50:25.490 --> 05:50:25.500 align:start position:0%
vote in my view thank you further
 
05:50:27.530 --> 05:50:27.540 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
05:50:30.590 --> 05:50:30.600 align:start position:0%
okay uh thank you thank you
 
05:50:37.670 --> 05:50:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:37.680 --> 05:50:39.170 align:start position:0%
 
sales

05:50:39.170 --> 05:50:39.180 align:start position:0%
sales
 
05:50:40.670 --> 05:50:40.680 align:start position:0%
um so the so the committee knows I'm
 
05:50:42.530 --> 05:50:42.540 align:start position:0%
going to have to depart here because
 
05:50:43.610 --> 05:50:43.620 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I have to go to something
 
05:50:47.030 --> 05:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
that actually will pay me 100 a year
 
05:50:48.708 --> 05:50:48.718 align:start position:0%
um normally representative Bowman would
 
05:50:50.390 --> 05:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
take over at my stud but he is not here
 
05:50:52.010 --> 05:50:52.020 align:start position:0%
so uh representative pruhome O'Brien
 
05:50:54.830 --> 05:50:54.840 align:start position:0%
when she returns uh will be in charge of
 
05:50:59.150 --> 05:50:59.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:02.448 --> 05:51:02.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:04.128 --> 05:51:04.138 align:start position:0%
good afternoon members of the committee
 
05:51:07.010 --> 05:51:07.020 align:start position:0%
uh I'm sales castan I live in Dover I'm
 
05:51:08.448 --> 05:51:08.458 align:start position:0%
here representing New Hampshire youth
 
05:51:10.250 --> 05:51:10.260 align:start position:0%
movement and I'm here to testify an
 
05:51:14.090 --> 05:51:14.100 align:start position:0%
opposition of hb460
 
05:51:16.610 --> 05:51:16.620 align:start position:0%
the most accessible part of our voting
 
05:51:18.890 --> 05:51:18.900 align:start position:0%
system is that voters can register at
 
05:51:21.230 --> 05:51:21.240 align:start position:0%
the polls with few barriers through a
 
05:51:23.090 --> 05:51:23.100 align:start position:0%
safe secure and efficient affidavit
 
05:51:25.548 --> 05:51:25.558 align:start position:0%
process when necessary we should not put
 
05:51:27.350 --> 05:51:27.360 align:start position:0%
that process in Jeopardy by passing
 
05:51:27.360 --> 05:51:29.090 align:start position:0%
that process in Jeopardy by passing
hb460

05:51:29.090 --> 05:51:29.100 align:start position:0%
hb460
 
05:51:31.368 --> 05:51:31.378 align:start position:0%
personally I've volunteered my time to
 
05:51:33.230 --> 05:51:33.240 align:start position:0%
help community members and my peers vote
 
05:51:35.030 --> 05:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
since my first election when I was 18
 
05:51:37.368 --> 05:51:37.378 align:start position:0%
years old currently I'm affiliated with
 
05:51:39.048 --> 05:51:39.058 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire youth movement
 
05:51:40.490 --> 05:51:40.500 align:start position:0%
while New Hampshire youth movement does
 
05:51:42.048 --> 05:51:42.058 align:start position:0%
endorse candidates the majority of our
 
05:51:44.510 --> 05:51:44.520 align:start position:0%
work on college campuses is nonpartisan
 
05:51:46.250 --> 05:51:46.260 align:start position:0%
we provide information and how and when
 
05:51:48.590 --> 05:51:48.600 align:start position:0%
to vote and provide and direct voters to
 
05:51:50.570 --> 05:51:50.580 align:start position:0%
free rides to the polls regardless of
 
05:51:52.128 --> 05:51:52.138 align:start position:0%
the candidates they vote for or the
 
05:51:53.810 --> 05:51:53.820 align:start position:0%
issues that are important to them
 
05:51:55.910 --> 05:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
I personally have spent my time in three
 
05:51:57.590 --> 05:51:57.600 align:start position:0%
elections giving rise to the polls to
 
05:51:59.810 --> 05:51:59.820 align:start position:0%
voters who didn't have cars I didn't ask
 
05:52:02.868 --> 05:52:02.878 align:start position:0%
who they were voting for and for when I
 
05:52:04.490 --> 05:52:04.500 align:start position:0%
gave them a ride nor would I deny any
 
05:52:06.530 --> 05:52:06.540 align:start position:0%
voter a ride if I knew they were voting
 
05:52:08.810 --> 05:52:08.820 align:start position:0%
for a candidate I did not support I do
 
05:52:10.128 --> 05:52:10.138 align:start position:0%
this because I believe that every
 
05:52:12.110 --> 05:52:12.120 align:start position:0%
eligible voter ought to be able to vote
 
05:52:14.270 --> 05:52:14.280 align:start position:0%
in an easy and safe process and that no
 
05:52:15.708 --> 05:52:15.718 align:start position:0%
one should be denied that opportunity
 
05:52:18.350 --> 05:52:18.360 align:start position:0%
for something like not having a car or a
 
05:52:18.360 --> 05:52:19.190 align:start position:0%
for something like not having a car or a
bike

05:52:19.190 --> 05:52:19.200 align:start position:0%
bike
 
05:52:20.750 --> 05:52:20.760 align:start position:0%
I know for my time working with
 
05:52:22.670 --> 05:52:22.680 align:start position:0%
first-time voters there's already a lot
 
05:52:24.830 --> 05:52:24.840 align:start position:0%
of confusion about voting many possible
 
05:52:26.868 --> 05:52:26.878 align:start position:0%
voters do not know when where and
 
05:52:28.788 --> 05:52:28.798 align:start position:0%
importantly for today what materials
 
05:52:31.010 --> 05:52:31.020 align:start position:0%
they need to register to vote to People
 
05:52:32.690 --> 05:52:32.700 align:start position:0%
Like Us who are deeply engaged in
 
05:52:34.850 --> 05:52:34.860 align:start position:0%
politics it's easy to forget that most
 
05:52:36.650 --> 05:52:36.660 align:start position:0%
people don't think about things like
 
05:52:38.750 --> 05:52:38.760 align:start position:0%
voter registration until election day or
 
05:52:40.970 --> 05:52:40.980 align:start position:0%
a few days before and newer voters are
 
05:52:42.410 --> 05:52:42.420 align:start position:0%
not familiar with the registration or
 
05:52:44.330 --> 05:52:44.340 align:start position:0%
absentee process unless someone has
 
05:52:46.430 --> 05:52:46.440 align:start position:0%
taken the time to walk them through it
 
05:52:48.590 --> 05:52:48.600 align:start position:0%
specifically the barriers related to
 
05:52:50.510 --> 05:52:50.520 align:start position:0%
registration disproportionately affect
 
05:52:53.330 --> 05:52:53.340 align:start position:0%
voters who move a lot renters students
 
05:52:55.310 --> 05:52:55.320 align:start position:0%
new New Hampshire citizens and people
 
05:52:57.410 --> 05:52:57.420 align:start position:0%
who work who move for work like travel
 
05:52:59.810 --> 05:52:59.820 align:start position:0%
nurses and those in the military because
 
05:53:01.310 --> 05:53:01.320 align:start position:0%
they constantly have to re-register at
 
05:53:02.470 --> 05:53:02.480 align:start position:0%
the new address
 
05:53:04.788 --> 05:53:04.798 align:start position:0%
hb460 would place a burden on these
 
05:53:06.770 --> 05:53:06.780 align:start position:0%
people by limit by eliminating a
 
05:53:08.868 --> 05:53:08.878 align:start position:0%
time-tested affidavit system that gives
 
05:53:10.730 --> 05:53:10.740 align:start position:0%
law-abiding voters a way to prove their
 
05:53:12.410 --> 05:53:12.420 align:start position:0%
identity if they don't have other
 
05:53:15.048 --> 05:53:15.058 align:start position:0%
documents available when registering we
 
05:53:16.430 --> 05:53:16.440 align:start position:0%
should oppose laws that make it harder
 
05:53:18.470 --> 05:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
for eligible voters to navigate the
 
05:53:20.990 --> 05:53:21.000 align:start position:0%
registration and voting processes
 
05:53:22.610 --> 05:53:22.620 align:start position:0%
I am proud to say that in New Hampshire
 
05:53:25.010 --> 05:53:25.020 align:start position:0%
we currently have strong safeguards at
 
05:53:26.510 --> 05:53:26.520 align:start position:0%
every stage of the voting process to
 
05:53:28.490 --> 05:53:28.500 align:start position:0%
guarantee safe and accurate elections
 
05:53:30.830 --> 05:53:30.840 align:start position:0%
however we do not have a system that is
 
05:53:33.288 --> 05:53:33.298 align:start position:0%
easily navigable by a sizable chunk of
 
05:53:35.810 --> 05:53:35.820 align:start position:0%
eligible voters I believe and experts
 
05:53:38.208 --> 05:53:38.218 align:start position:0%
agree that we can have accessibility and
 
05:53:40.850 --> 05:53:40.860 align:start position:0%
safety but HP 460 would not make our
 
05:53:43.010 --> 05:53:43.020 align:start position:0%
election safer and instead would make
 
05:53:45.590 --> 05:53:45.600 align:start position:0%
them less accessible we have already we
 
05:53:47.030 --> 05:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
already have a secure and reasonably
 
05:53:49.490 --> 05:53:49.500 align:start position:0%
accessible voter registration process we
 
05:53:50.990 --> 05:53:51.000 align:start position:0%
should not put that process in jeopardy
 
05:53:54.048 --> 05:53:54.058 align:start position:0%
with this bill please oppose HP 460.
 
05:53:56.628 --> 05:53:56.638 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:53:59.208 --> 05:53:59.218 align:start position:0%
there any questions
 
05:54:19.090 --> 05:54:19.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:23.090 --> 05:54:23.100 align:start position:0%
hi hi Mr chairman committee thank you
 
05:54:25.910 --> 05:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
for taking my testimony today
 
05:54:28.670 --> 05:54:28.680 align:start position:0%
um my name is Louise Spencer I am
 
05:54:30.670 --> 05:54:30.680 align:start position:0%
co-founder of the Ken Street Coalition
 
05:54:33.610 --> 05:54:33.620 align:start position:0%
which is an all-volunteer Grassroots
 
05:54:36.230 --> 05:54:36.240 align:start position:0%
organization I'm not paid to be here
 
05:54:36.240 --> 05:54:38.110 align:start position:0%
organization I'm not paid to be here
today

05:54:38.110 --> 05:54:38.120 align:start position:0%
today
 
05:54:40.910 --> 05:54:40.920 align:start position:0%
and I just want to start off by saying I
 
05:54:42.650 --> 05:54:42.660 align:start position:0%
I think I have a
 
05:54:46.010 --> 05:54:46.020 align:start position:0%
very different sense of Voters and then
 
05:54:48.770 --> 05:54:48.780 align:start position:0%
some have expressed which is I've done a
 
05:54:50.390 --> 05:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
lot of work at the polls I've done a lot
 
05:54:51.650 --> 05:54:51.660 align:start position:0%
of canvassing
 
05:54:54.948 --> 05:54:54.958 align:start position:0%
most people really want to vote and
 
05:54:56.570 --> 05:54:56.580 align:start position:0%
really want to participate the people
 
05:54:58.970 --> 05:54:58.980 align:start position:0%
that show up are there because they
 
05:55:02.090 --> 05:55:02.100 align:start position:0%
think it's their Duty as a citizen and
 
05:55:04.030 --> 05:55:04.040 align:start position:0%
they do that in good faith
 
05:55:08.270 --> 05:55:08.280 align:start position:0%
so I'm very opposed to a bill that would
 
05:55:10.610 --> 05:55:10.620 align:start position:0%
put obstacles in the way of Voters who
 
05:55:13.430 --> 05:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
are otherwise qualified to vote
 
05:55:13.440 --> 05:55:15.470 align:start position:0%
are otherwise qualified to vote
um

05:55:15.470 --> 05:55:15.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:55:17.810 --> 05:55:17.820 align:start position:0%
I am also I do want to make clear today
 
05:55:19.850 --> 05:55:19.860 align:start position:0%
that I am speaking on behalf of the
 
05:55:23.090 --> 05:55:23.100 align:start position:0%
chemistry Coalition this is a very
 
05:55:26.570 --> 05:55:26.580 align:start position:0%
um big priority for our organization to
 
05:55:28.970 --> 05:55:28.980 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill
 
05:55:31.548 --> 05:55:31.558 align:start position:0%
um I know it's hard for some of us to
 
05:55:34.190 --> 05:55:34.200 align:start position:0%
imagine just how difficult it might be
 
05:55:37.070 --> 05:55:37.080 align:start position:0%
for people to have some of the documents
 
05:55:39.890 --> 05:55:39.900 align:start position:0%
that are required by this bill that
 
05:55:41.990 --> 05:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
includes the housing insecure or those
 
05:55:44.330 --> 05:55:44.340 align:start position:0%
with no housing those who have lost
 
05:55:46.730 --> 05:55:46.740 align:start position:0%
important documents Through Fire flood
 
05:55:50.208 --> 05:55:50.218 align:start position:0%
or other natural disasters new Americans
 
05:55:52.850 --> 05:55:52.860 align:start position:0%
especially young adult voters whose
 
05:55:55.430 --> 05:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
parents might have the documents and
 
05:55:58.070 --> 05:55:58.080 align:start position:0%
victims of domestic violence it also
 
05:56:00.890 --> 05:56:00.900 align:start position:0%
presents challenges for seniors and for
 
05:56:04.670 --> 05:56:04.680 align:start position:0%
those with disabilities I want to tell a
 
05:56:06.590 --> 05:56:06.600 align:start position:0%
story about a man I recently met in
 
05:56:09.590 --> 05:56:09.600 align:start position:0%
Concord who was house lit who did not
 
05:56:12.470 --> 05:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
have a home he was holding a sign that
 
05:56:16.730 --> 05:56:16.740 align:start position:0%
said need work no ID he had lost access
 
05:56:19.070 --> 05:56:19.080 align:start position:0%
to his important documents including his
 
05:56:21.470 --> 05:56:21.480 align:start position:0%
driver's license when he broke up with
 
05:56:22.970 --> 05:56:22.980 align:start position:0%
his girlfriend they have been living
 
05:56:26.510 --> 05:56:26.520 align:start position:0%
together and she refused to return any
 
05:56:30.288 --> 05:56:30.298 align:start position:0%
of his documents or their possessions
 
05:56:32.868 --> 05:56:32.878 align:start position:0%
in addition he was estranged from his
 
05:56:35.948 --> 05:56:35.958 align:start position:0%
his parents and was not sure
 
05:56:38.270 --> 05:56:38.280 align:start position:0%
if they had a copy of his birth
 
05:56:40.010 --> 05:56:40.020 align:start position:0%
certificate because we talked about
 
05:56:42.650 --> 05:56:42.660 align:start position:0%
voting he wasn't even sure what town he
 
05:56:46.128 --> 05:56:46.138 align:start position:0%
or state he was born in
 
05:56:48.288 --> 05:56:48.298 align:start position:0%
um so he wasn't sure where to go to
 
05:56:51.170 --> 05:56:51.180 align:start position:0%
apply to get a duplicate certificate he
 
05:56:53.690 --> 05:56:53.700 align:start position:0%
had gone to the DMV several times to get
 
05:56:55.970 --> 05:56:55.980 align:start position:0%
a replacement license but without these
 
05:56:59.030 --> 05:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
other documents he was unable to do so
 
05:57:00.948 --> 05:57:00.958 align:start position:0%
I was aware that the Concord coalition
 
05:57:03.230 --> 05:57:03.240 align:start position:0%
to end homelessness provided help to
 
05:57:06.230 --> 05:57:06.240 align:start position:0%
people like this man and so I he took me
 
05:57:08.330 --> 05:57:08.340 align:start position:0%
up on his the offer to drive him over
 
05:57:11.090 --> 05:57:11.100 align:start position:0%
there and was thrilled that there might
 
05:57:12.770 --> 05:57:12.780 align:start position:0%
be someone who could finally help him
 
05:57:15.070 --> 05:57:15.080 align:start position:0%
navigate this process
 
05:57:17.810 --> 05:57:17.820 align:start position:0%
we spoke to a representative at the
 
05:57:20.030 --> 05:57:20.040 align:start position:0%
Coalition and they said it it is often a
 
05:57:23.448 --> 05:57:23.458 align:start position:0%
several months-long process
 
05:57:23.458 --> 05:57:24.048 align:start position:0%
several months-long process
um

05:57:24.048 --> 05:57:24.058 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:57:26.810 --> 05:57:26.820 align:start position:0%
a friend's parents recently lost their
 
05:57:30.530 --> 05:57:30.540 align:start position:0%
home in the Colorado fires fortunately
 
05:57:32.090 --> 05:57:32.100 align:start position:0%
they had all their documents together
 
05:57:32.100 --> 05:57:33.890 align:start position:0%
they had all their documents together
but

05:57:33.890 --> 05:57:33.900 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:57:35.750 --> 05:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
some of their friends and others they
 
05:57:37.910 --> 05:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
knew escaped with barely their lives
 
05:57:40.010 --> 05:57:40.020 align:start position:0%
they did not have any of their documents
 
05:57:42.470 --> 05:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
they then entered into a horrible
 
05:57:46.368 --> 05:57:46.378 align:start position:0%
catch-2 Catch-22 situation where they
 
05:57:49.310 --> 05:57:49.320 align:start position:0%
were unable to to get the documents they
 
05:57:52.970 --> 05:57:52.980 align:start position:0%
needed to proceed forward with their
 
05:57:52.980 --> 05:57:54.010 align:start position:0%
needed to proceed forward with their
lives

05:57:54.010 --> 05:57:54.020 align:start position:0%
lives
 
05:57:57.948 --> 05:57:57.958 align:start position:0%
some places let a parent swear to you
 
05:57:59.810 --> 05:57:59.820 align:start position:0%
know where you were born you can do that
 
05:58:01.788 --> 05:58:01.798 align:start position:0%
they can do an affidavit for you but a
 
05:58:03.230 --> 05:58:03.240 align:start position:0%
lot of these folks were in their 80s
 
05:58:05.930 --> 05:58:05.940 align:start position:0%
their parents were no longer living
 
05:58:07.788 --> 05:58:07.798 align:start position:0%
I also checked with an immigration
 
05:58:10.310 --> 05:58:10.320 align:start position:0%
attorney about for those people that
 
05:58:12.890 --> 05:58:12.900 align:start position:0%
might have lost or not had access to
 
05:58:15.350 --> 05:58:15.360 align:start position:0%
their naturalization certificates
 
05:58:20.708 --> 05:58:20.718 align:start position:0%
to get a replacement with the n565 is
 
05:58:24.470 --> 05:58:24.480 align:start position:0%
555 dollars plus some additional fees
 
05:58:27.948 --> 05:58:27.958 align:start position:0%
bringing the cost to about 700 and it's
 
05:58:31.730 --> 05:58:31.740 align:start position:0%
a 10 to 12 month processing time
 
05:58:34.310 --> 05:58:34.320 align:start position:0%
and not everyone has a passport in fact
 
05:58:36.650 --> 05:58:36.660 align:start position:0%
it appears currently it's hard to get
 
05:58:39.470 --> 05:58:39.480 align:start position:0%
the specific data that about half of
 
05:58:42.170 --> 05:58:42.180 align:start position:0%
Americans have valid passports some may
 
05:58:44.750 --> 05:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
have expired passports but it leaves a
 
05:58:46.368 --> 05:58:46.378 align:start position:0%
good number of people who don't have
 
05:58:49.850 --> 05:58:49.860 align:start position:0%
that option approving citizenship
 
05:58:49.860 --> 05:58:51.070 align:start position:0%
that option approving citizenship
since

05:58:51.070 --> 05:58:51.080 align:start position:0%
since
 
05:58:54.288 --> 05:58:54.298 align:start position:0%
2006 the Heritage Foundation has cited
 
05:58:57.670 --> 05:58:57.680 align:start position:0%
20 cases of voter fraud in New Hampshire
 
05:59:00.770 --> 05:59:00.780 align:start position:0%
that have been successfully
 
05:59:00.780 --> 05:59:01.850 align:start position:0%
that have been successfully
um

05:59:01.850 --> 05:59:01.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:59:01.860 --> 05:59:04.490 align:start position:0%
um
verified

05:59:04.490 --> 05:59:04.500 align:start position:0%
verified
 
05:59:06.890 --> 05:59:06.900 align:start position:0%
um and that's out of millions of votes
 
05:59:10.730 --> 05:59:10.740 align:start position:0%
cast Over multiple elections
 
05:59:10.740 --> 05:59:12.048 align:start position:0%
cast Over multiple elections
um

05:59:12.048 --> 05:59:12.058 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:59:14.090 --> 05:59:14.100 align:start position:0%
I want to ask the question we've heard
 
05:59:17.270 --> 05:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
that it's hard to verify you know what
 
05:59:19.670 --> 05:59:19.680 align:start position:0%
the voter fraud might be it's much
 
05:59:22.030 --> 05:59:22.040 align:start position:0%
harder to verify the voter
 
05:59:24.470 --> 05:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
disenfranchisement who are the people
 
05:59:27.948 --> 05:59:27.958 align:start position:0%
that are not going to be able to uh that
 
05:59:29.690 --> 05:59:29.700 align:start position:0%
get turned away we might be able to
 
05:59:32.208 --> 05:59:32.218 align:start position:0%
count some of those people but what
 
05:59:33.948 --> 05:59:33.958 align:start position:0%
about the people who say oh I don't have
 
05:59:35.750 --> 05:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
a birth certificate I'm not going to go
 
05:59:38.510 --> 05:59:38.520 align:start position:0%
or who feel overwhelmed I've talked to
 
05:59:40.910 --> 05:59:40.920 align:start position:0%
plenty of those people at the door who
 
05:59:43.548 --> 05:59:43.558 align:start position:0%
really feel like voting registering to
 
05:59:45.708 --> 05:59:45.718 align:start position:0%
vote is a very complex and difficult
 
05:59:48.288 --> 05:59:48.298 align:start position:0%
process how many people who are
 
05:59:51.410 --> 05:59:51.420 align:start position:0%
legitimately qualified constitutionally
 
05:59:54.230 --> 05:59:54.240 align:start position:0%
qualified in our state to vote are not
 
05:59:56.270 --> 05:59:56.280 align:start position:0%
going to be able to vote that's what's
 
05:59:58.430 --> 05:59:58.440 align:start position:0%
going to sway our elections not the
 
06:00:01.368 --> 06:00:01.378 align:start position:0%
occasional person who perhaps
 
06:00:04.368 --> 06:00:04.378 align:start position:0%
you know perhaps you know one of these
 
06:00:07.070 --> 06:00:07.080 align:start position:0%
20 there's never been an indication that
 
06:00:09.110 --> 06:00:09.120 align:start position:0%
it's swayed actually swayed an election
 
06:00:12.170 --> 06:00:12.180 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State Bill Gardner qualif
 
06:00:12.180 --> 06:00:12.830 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State Bill Gardner qualif
um

06:00:12.830 --> 06:00:12.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:00:14.690 --> 06:00:14.700 align:start position:0%
spoke to that issue
 
06:00:16.128 --> 06:00:16.138 align:start position:0%
I also want to point out that an
 
06:00:18.948 --> 06:00:18.958 align:start position:0%
affidavit is a document it's a piece of
 
06:00:21.530 --> 06:00:21.540 align:start position:0%
paper that you sign and it's a legal
 
06:00:25.010 --> 06:00:25.020 align:start position:0%
document signed under penalty of law
 
06:00:28.010 --> 06:00:28.020 align:start position:0%
and finally I want to point out that I
 
06:00:30.288 --> 06:00:30.298 align:start position:0%
have seen those people as an election
 
06:00:33.590 --> 06:00:33.600 align:start position:0%
Observer I'm at the polls almost every
 
06:00:37.070 --> 06:00:37.080 align:start position:0%
election every election in all the towns
 
06:00:39.650 --> 06:00:39.660 align:start position:0%
I've been at not through malfeasance or
 
06:00:42.048 --> 06:00:42.058 align:start position:0%
I'm not accusing anybody of trying to
 
06:00:44.810 --> 06:00:44.820 align:start position:0%
purposely drop people from the rolls but
 
06:00:47.810 --> 06:00:47.820 align:start position:0%
people get dropped for whatever reason
 
06:00:51.048 --> 06:00:51.058 align:start position:0%
and those people are not showing up with
 
06:00:52.730 --> 06:00:52.740 align:start position:0%
their documentation thinking they're
 
06:00:55.070 --> 06:00:55.080 align:start position:0%
going to have to re-register and as one
 
06:00:57.048 --> 06:00:57.058 align:start position:0%
person testified to these are sometimes
 
06:00:59.448 --> 06:00:59.458 align:start position:0%
people who they haven't moved they've
 
06:01:01.670 --> 06:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
voted in every other election and yet
 
06:01:04.250 --> 06:01:04.260 align:start position:0%
mysteriously they're not on the the
 
06:01:04.260 --> 06:01:07.070 align:start position:0%
mysteriously they're not on the the
rolls

06:01:07.070 --> 06:01:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:09.590 --> 06:01:09.600 align:start position:0%
let me point out that I know you read
 
06:01:13.490 --> 06:01:13.500 align:start position:0%
from the blue sheets but as of 147 uh
 
06:01:17.628 --> 06:01:17.638 align:start position:0%
one o'clock at 1 47 today it's what I'm
 
06:01:19.730 --> 06:01:19.740 align:start position:0%
meaning to say the general court
 
06:01:22.610 --> 06:01:22.620 align:start position:0%
registered 11 people in support of this
 
06:01:27.410 --> 06:01:27.420 align:start position:0%
bill and 619 opposed with zero neutral I
 
06:01:29.110 --> 06:01:29.120 align:start position:0%
think that's because people understand
 
06:01:31.548 --> 06:01:31.558 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire doesn't need this
 
06:01:34.548 --> 06:01:34.558 align:start position:0%
bill we have a voting system that works
 
06:01:37.850 --> 06:01:37.860 align:start position:0%
we have checks and balances built into
 
06:01:42.830 --> 06:01:42.840 align:start position:0%
our system we want our sit in three to
 
06:01:45.170 --> 06:01:45.180 align:start position:0%
participate that's the foundation of a
 
06:01:47.690 --> 06:01:47.700 align:start position:0%
democracy and it's the most fundamental
 
06:01:50.868 --> 06:01:50.878 align:start position:0%
right in our democracy so I urge you
 
06:01:55.910 --> 06:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
please to um itl this Bill thank you
 
06:01:59.690 --> 06:01:59.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:02.208 --> 06:02:02.218 align:start position:0%
representative Brennan oh I'm sorry
 
06:02:03.830 --> 06:02:03.840 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
06:02:05.690 --> 06:02:05.700 align:start position:0%
question I just want to go back to the
 
06:02:07.670 --> 06:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
part of your testimony where you spoke
 
06:02:09.770 --> 06:02:09.780 align:start position:0%
about measuring
 
06:02:12.590 --> 06:02:12.600 align:start position:0%
um disenfranchisement yes
 
06:02:12.600 --> 06:02:13.310 align:start position:0%
um disenfranchisement yes
um

06:02:13.310 --> 06:02:13.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:02:15.350 --> 06:02:15.360 align:start position:0%
is it your testimony that this bill
 
06:02:17.510 --> 06:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
would have a chilling effect on voter
 
06:02:17.520 --> 06:02:19.070 align:start position:0%
would have a chilling effect on voter
participation

06:02:19.070 --> 06:02:19.080 align:start position:0%
participation
 
06:02:22.850 --> 06:02:22.860 align:start position:0%
yes I I believe it would and I think
 
06:02:24.770 --> 06:02:24.780 align:start position:0%
that there are
 
06:02:27.708 --> 06:02:27.718 align:start position:0%
you know if you look back at some of the
 
06:02:31.070 --> 06:02:31.080 align:start position:0%
testimony for example in sb3 and the
 
06:02:34.670 --> 06:02:34.680 align:start position:0%
court case set ensued with that case we
 
06:02:36.410 --> 06:02:36.420 align:start position:0%
did have people testifying about
 
06:02:38.448 --> 06:02:38.458 align:start position:0%
different restrictions that get put in
 
06:02:42.350 --> 06:02:42.360 align:start position:0%
place that can discourage voters
 
06:02:45.170 --> 06:02:45.180 align:start position:0%
um from voting so
 
06:02:47.868 --> 06:02:47.878 align:start position:0%
I I think that
 
06:02:51.288 --> 06:02:51.298 align:start position:0%
having talked with many many people many
 
06:02:54.770 --> 06:02:54.780 align:start position:0%
voters over 25 years at the doors I know
 
06:02:57.350 --> 06:02:57.360 align:start position:0%
that people worry about the process of
 
06:02:59.510 --> 06:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
voting and they don't want to commit a
 
06:03:02.090 --> 06:03:02.100 align:start position:0%
crime that's the last thing in the world
 
06:03:04.368 --> 06:03:04.378 align:start position:0%
that people want to do when it comes to
 
06:03:07.730 --> 06:03:07.740 align:start position:0%
voting so they want to do what they need
 
06:03:09.470 --> 06:03:09.480 align:start position:0%
to do and they want to do it correctly
 
06:03:11.448 --> 06:03:11.458 align:start position:0%
and most of the time they try to bring
 
06:03:13.548 --> 06:03:13.558 align:start position:0%
the documents that they need but
 
06:03:15.530 --> 06:03:15.540 align:start position:0%
sometimes life intervenes and it makes
 
06:03:18.650 --> 06:03:18.660 align:start position:0%
it impossible and I would be very sad if
 
06:03:20.448 --> 06:03:20.458 align:start position:0%
there were voters in our community and I
 
06:03:21.890 --> 06:03:21.900 align:start position:0%
don't care if they're Democrats I don't
 
06:03:23.208 --> 06:03:23.218 align:start position:0%
care if they're Republicans or
 
06:03:25.850 --> 06:03:25.860 align:start position:0%
independents I want those who are
 
06:03:28.850 --> 06:03:28.860 align:start position:0%
qualified to vote in my community to be
 
06:03:31.010 --> 06:03:31.020 align:start position:0%
able to come in and share in that
 
06:03:34.128 --> 06:03:34.138 align:start position:0%
process so that we can get a sense of
 
06:03:38.030 --> 06:03:38.040 align:start position:0%
what our electorate wants so I have no
 
06:03:40.070 --> 06:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
interest in limiting anybody who's
 
06:03:42.288 --> 06:03:42.298 align:start position:0%
qualified to vote from being able to
 
06:03:45.770 --> 06:03:45.780 align:start position:0%
vote thank you any other questions
 
06:03:50.150 --> 06:03:50.160 align:start position:0%
with that thank you thank you I now call
 
06:04:14.030 --> 06:04:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:16.310 --> 06:04:16.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and the committee for
 
06:04:18.350 --> 06:04:18.360 align:start position:0%
this opportunity to speak I'm Liz
 
06:04:20.448 --> 06:04:20.458 align:start position:0%
tentarelli I'm president of the League
 
06:04:23.090 --> 06:04:23.100 align:start position:0%
of Women Voters of New Hampshire
 
06:04:26.628 --> 06:04:26.638 align:start position:0%
we are a non-partisan organization and
 
06:04:30.170 --> 06:04:30.180 align:start position:0%
our primary mission is empowering voters
 
06:04:33.530 --> 06:04:33.540 align:start position:0%
that has been our mission for 103 years
 
06:04:37.070 --> 06:04:37.080 align:start position:0%
we try to explain the voting process and
 
06:04:39.590 --> 06:04:39.600 align:start position:0%
the registration process in the simplest
 
06:04:42.530 --> 06:04:42.540 align:start position:0%
terms possible and that becomes harder
 
06:04:45.650 --> 06:04:45.660 align:start position:0%
and harder the more laws we pass we
 
06:04:48.350 --> 06:04:48.360 align:start position:0%
often get calls or emails asking for
 
06:04:50.628 --> 06:04:50.638 align:start position:0%
advice from would-be voters
 
06:04:53.030 --> 06:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
especially after a bill like this is in
 
06:04:55.850 --> 06:04:55.860 align:start position:0%
the news people ask about registering to
 
06:04:58.010 --> 06:04:58.020 align:start position:0%
vote after they've just moved and they
 
06:05:00.530 --> 06:05:00.540 align:start position:0%
don't have a tax bill or a utility bill
 
06:05:02.990 --> 06:05:03.000 align:start position:0%
or an updated driver's license
 
06:05:06.110 --> 06:05:06.120 align:start position:0%
parents ask how their eager 18 year olds
 
06:05:08.810 --> 06:05:08.820 align:start position:0%
can register if they don't drive and
 
06:05:10.610 --> 06:05:10.620 align:start position:0%
they have no other proof of where they
 
06:05:13.610 --> 06:05:13.620 align:start position:0%
live except the parents word and the
 
06:05:15.770 --> 06:05:15.780 align:start position:0%
town clerk once told me of a young man
 
06:05:18.288 --> 06:05:18.298 align:start position:0%
who showed up with a birthday card in
 
06:05:21.110 --> 06:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
its envelope addressed to him from his
 
06:05:23.570 --> 06:05:23.580 align:start position:0%
grandma and said it was the best he
 
06:05:26.810 --> 06:05:26.820 align:start position:0%
could find to prove where he lives she
 
06:05:28.430 --> 06:05:28.440 align:start position:0%
accepted it
 
06:05:31.190 --> 06:05:31.200 align:start position:0%
but you know for people like us with
 
06:05:33.770 --> 06:05:33.780 align:start position:0%
stable homes passports drivers licenses
 
06:05:36.048 --> 06:05:36.058 align:start position:0%
this bill is not an issue
 
06:05:38.330 --> 06:05:38.340 align:start position:0%
but the League of Women Voters opposes
 
06:05:40.190 --> 06:05:40.200 align:start position:0%
this bill on the grounds that it makes
 
06:05:43.128 --> 06:05:43.138 align:start position:0%
voter registration harder for New
 
06:05:45.830 --> 06:05:45.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents that it gets rid of
 
06:05:48.128 --> 06:05:48.138 align:start position:0%
affidavits to prove qualifications
 
06:05:49.970 --> 06:05:49.980 align:start position:0%
affidavits which have been used
 
06:05:53.448 --> 06:05:53.458 align:start position:0%
successfully for at least a decade and
 
06:05:56.208 --> 06:05:56.218 align:start position:0%
it puts the voter last in the interests
 
06:06:00.110 --> 06:06:00.120 align:start position:0%
of the law it raises conspiracy theories
 
06:06:03.170 --> 06:06:03.180 align:start position:0%
of widespread illegal voting which have
 
06:06:05.810 --> 06:06:05.820 align:start position:0%
never been supported by evidence above
 
06:06:08.230 --> 06:06:08.240 align:start position:0%
the goal of a representative government
 
06:06:11.510 --> 06:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
in which all eligible voters have a
 
06:06:14.868 --> 06:06:14.878 align:start position:0%
voice I want to address three points of
 
06:06:18.350 --> 06:06:18.360 align:start position:0%
bad policy about the use of affidavits
 
06:06:20.090 --> 06:06:20.100 align:start position:0%
in this bill
 
06:06:25.368 --> 06:06:25.378 align:start position:0%
on page 2 lines 15 and 20 section I
 
06:06:28.810 --> 06:06:28.820 align:start position:0%
it talks about reasonable documentation
 
06:06:31.788 --> 06:06:31.798 align:start position:0%
about domicile
 
06:06:34.548 --> 06:06:34.558 align:start position:0%
and what I highlighted in my testimony
 
06:06:38.390 --> 06:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
for you says that a written statement
 
06:06:41.390 --> 06:06:41.400 align:start position:0%
from a person who is listed as the owner
 
06:06:44.530 --> 06:06:44.540 align:start position:0%
of the property where someone lives
 
06:06:47.708 --> 06:06:47.718 align:start position:0%
is is appropriate
 
06:06:50.690 --> 06:06:50.700 align:start position:0%
documentation signed by that person
 
06:06:53.868 --> 06:06:53.878 align:start position:0%
under penalty of voter fraud
 
06:06:56.510 --> 06:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
there's an example where we're going to
 
06:06:59.750 --> 06:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
take someone else's word a signed
 
06:07:03.410 --> 06:07:03.420 align:start position:0%
document as verification but we won't
 
06:07:06.410 --> 06:07:06.420 align:start position:0%
take the signed document the Affidavit
 
06:07:08.930 --> 06:07:08.940 align:start position:0%
of the person registering to vote
 
06:07:13.368 --> 06:07:13.378 align:start position:0%
himself now I'm glad this option this
 
06:07:16.490 --> 06:07:16.500 align:start position:0%
option exists to get proof from a
 
06:07:19.250 --> 06:07:19.260 align:start position:0%
property owner or property manager my
 
06:07:22.250 --> 06:07:22.260 align:start position:0%
20-something grandson is is moving this
 
06:07:25.850 --> 06:07:25.860 align:start position:0%
weekend in fact for a new job in a new
 
06:07:27.530 --> 06:07:27.540 align:start position:0%
city New State
 
06:07:29.990 --> 06:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
and um you know he's moving in with
 
06:07:32.330 --> 06:07:32.340 align:start position:0%
several guys he doesn't have anything to
 
06:07:34.010 --> 06:07:34.020 align:start position:0%
prove he lives there yet he'll
 
06:07:35.750 --> 06:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
eventually have something but he's not
 
06:07:37.610 --> 06:07:37.620 align:start position:0%
got a utility bill
 
06:07:39.470 --> 06:07:39.480 align:start position:0%
I don't know how he's going to do it at
 
06:07:41.448 --> 06:07:41.458 align:start position:0%
least he's got some time before the next
 
06:07:44.270 --> 06:07:44.280 align:start position:0%
election low-income people who couch
 
06:07:47.030 --> 06:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
surf have nothing to prove where they
 
06:07:49.970 --> 06:07:49.980 align:start position:0%
live and elderly people might like my
 
06:07:51.708 --> 06:07:51.718 align:start position:0%
neighbor's mother move in with their
 
06:07:53.390 --> 06:07:53.400 align:start position:0%
grown children and they never get
 
06:07:56.330 --> 06:07:56.340 align:start position:0%
utility bills or a lease in their own
 
06:07:56.340 --> 06:07:58.490 align:start position:0%
utility bills or a lease in their own
names

06:07:58.490 --> 06:07:58.500 align:start position:0%
names
 
06:08:00.830 --> 06:08:00.840 align:start position:0%
so at least they had the option of
 
06:08:03.410 --> 06:08:03.420 align:start position:0%
getting someone to vouch for them why
 
06:08:05.868 --> 06:08:05.878 align:start position:0%
can they not sign an affidavit on their
 
06:08:08.628 --> 06:08:08.638 align:start position:0%
own why will we not believe them
 
06:08:13.368 --> 06:08:13.378 align:start position:0%
now on page two lines 34 and 35
 
06:08:13.378 --> 06:08:14.030 align:start position:0%
now on page two lines 34 and 35
um

06:08:14.030 --> 06:08:14.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:08:15.850 --> 06:08:15.860 align:start position:0%
we talk about
 
06:08:18.650 --> 06:08:18.660 align:start position:0%
challenges to voters you know that that
 
06:08:21.170 --> 06:08:21.180 align:start position:0%
the presumptions may be defeated by
 
06:08:24.110 --> 06:08:24.120 align:start position:0%
evidence establishing it's more likely
 
06:08:26.448 --> 06:08:26.458 align:start position:0%
than not that the applicant is not
 
06:08:28.250 --> 06:08:28.260 align:start position:0%
qualified I've never seen so many
 
06:08:30.190 --> 06:08:30.200 align:start position:0%
negatives in one sentence
 
06:08:34.368 --> 06:08:34.378 align:start position:0%
but anyway it goes on eventually on page
 
06:08:39.170 --> 06:08:39.180 align:start position:0%
eight on lines 1 through 23 to talk
 
06:08:42.230 --> 06:08:42.240 align:start position:0%
about the affidavit signed by a
 
06:08:44.810 --> 06:08:44.820 align:start position:0%
challenger so you're going to take an
 
06:08:47.570 --> 06:08:47.580 align:start position:0%
affidavit from someone who wants to
 
06:08:51.048 --> 06:08:51.058 align:start position:0%
challenge a voter as being unqualified
 
06:08:53.690 --> 06:08:53.700 align:start position:0%
but you won't take an affidavit by the
 
06:08:56.208 --> 06:08:56.218 align:start position:0%
would-be voter
 
06:08:58.490 --> 06:08:58.500 align:start position:0%
whose interests are here
 
06:09:01.128 --> 06:09:01.138 align:start position:0%
the voter who has the right to register
 
06:09:04.208 --> 06:09:04.218 align:start position:0%
and vote or other people
 
06:09:07.548 --> 06:09:07.558 align:start position:0%
decide you've got to figure this out
 
06:09:09.670 --> 06:09:09.680 align:start position:0%
and finally
 
06:09:12.948 --> 06:09:12.958 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn alluded to the part
 
06:09:16.070 --> 06:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
at the end where if on Election Day
 
06:09:18.650 --> 06:09:18.660 align:start position:0%
somebody is challenged and the moderator
 
06:09:20.690 --> 06:09:20.700 align:start position:0%
isn't sure what to do about this and
 
06:09:22.310 --> 06:09:22.320 align:start position:0%
says well I don't think you should vote
 
06:09:24.650 --> 06:09:24.660 align:start position:0%
that that person then has the right to
 
06:09:28.548 --> 06:09:28.558 align:start position:0%
go to superior court that day to find a
 
06:09:31.010 --> 06:09:31.020 align:start position:0%
judge willing to hear the case to
 
06:09:33.770 --> 06:09:33.780 align:start position:0%
somehow round up that paperwork and then
 
06:09:35.930 --> 06:09:35.940 align:start position:0%
scoop back to the polls and be given a
 
06:09:35.940 --> 06:09:37.070 align:start position:0%
scoop back to the polls and be given a
ballot

06:09:37.070 --> 06:09:37.080 align:start position:0%
ballot
 
06:09:37.080 --> 06:09:39.708 align:start position:0%
ballot
really

06:09:39.708 --> 06:09:39.718 align:start position:0%
really
 
06:09:42.530 --> 06:09:42.540 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:44.448 --> 06:09:44.458 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
06:09:48.230 --> 06:09:48.240 align:start position:0%
with that thank you thank you I now call
 
06:09:55.310 --> 06:09:55.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:01.970 --> 06:10:01.980 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:03.650 --> 06:10:03.660 align:start position:0%
good afternoon members of the committee
 
06:10:05.990 --> 06:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
my name is Mackenzie Saint-Germain I'm
 
06:10:07.548 --> 06:10:07.558 align:start position:0%
the campaign director for the New
 
06:10:09.110 --> 06:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire campaign for voting rights
 
06:10:11.150 --> 06:10:11.160 align:start position:0%
which is a project of America votes New
 
06:10:13.190 --> 06:10:13.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm here today in opposition
 
06:10:16.610 --> 06:10:16.620 align:start position:0%
to HB 460. our New Hampshire elections
 
06:10:19.368 --> 06:10:19.378 align:start position:0%
are safe secure and accurate voters have
 
06:10:21.170 --> 06:10:21.180 align:start position:0%
really high levels of confidence in our
 
06:10:26.090 --> 06:10:26.100 align:start position:0%
elections after the 2022 election 91 of
 
06:10:28.610 --> 06:10:28.620 align:start position:0%
those polled in a UNH poll so that they
 
06:10:30.708 --> 06:10:30.718 align:start position:0%
were confident that our election results
 
06:10:32.868 --> 06:10:32.878 align:start position:0%
were accurately counted and granite
 
06:10:34.310 --> 06:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
theaters have good reason to be
 
06:10:36.530 --> 06:10:36.540 align:start position:0%
confident in our elections we have an
 
06:10:38.810 --> 06:10:38.820 align:start position:0%
accessible and secure same-day
 
06:10:41.030 --> 06:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
registration process where voters do
 
06:10:44.628 --> 06:10:44.638 align:start position:0%
prove their identity age citizenship and
 
06:10:47.030 --> 06:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
domicile when registering right now they
 
06:10:49.010 --> 06:10:49.020 align:start position:0%
do so by either providing documents
 
06:10:51.470 --> 06:10:51.480 align:start position:0%
proving those things or by signing a
 
06:10:53.270 --> 06:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
legal document under oath called
 
06:10:56.150 --> 06:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
affidavit these are legal documents they
 
06:10:58.310 --> 06:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
have serious penalties and it's
 
06:11:00.530 --> 06:11:00.540 align:start position:0%
important to note also that they are
 
06:11:02.150 --> 06:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
reviewed by the Secretary of State's
 
06:11:03.708 --> 06:11:03.718 align:start position:0%
office and if needed the Attorney
 
06:11:05.810 --> 06:11:05.820 align:start position:0%
General so those documents don't just go
 
06:11:07.970 --> 06:11:07.980 align:start position:0%
away after they're used they are looked
 
06:11:07.980 --> 06:11:08.750 align:start position:0%
away after they're used they are looked
into

06:11:08.750 --> 06:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
into
 
06:11:10.910 --> 06:11:10.920 align:start position:0%
this Builder moved that affidavit system
 
06:11:13.310 --> 06:11:13.320 align:start position:0%
which is the only system that exists for
 
06:11:15.350 --> 06:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
granite Staters who do not have or
 
06:11:17.750 --> 06:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
forget any of the requirement acquired
 
06:11:19.490 --> 06:11:19.500 align:start position:0%
documents to be able to exercise their
 
06:11:21.230 --> 06:11:21.240 align:start position:0%
right to vote and it really isn't
 
06:11:22.730 --> 06:11:22.740 align:start position:0%
difficult to find voters who have
 
06:11:25.070 --> 06:11:25.080 align:start position:0%
registered using affidavits no I'm one
 
06:11:27.530 --> 06:11:27.540 align:start position:0%
of probably many in this room
 
06:11:29.270 --> 06:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
um I registered to vote as an 18 year
 
06:11:31.910 --> 06:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
old in high school I had a free period
 
06:11:34.190 --> 06:11:34.200 align:start position:0%
And I went down to the cafeteria to
 
06:11:35.990 --> 06:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
register and vote in our town elections
 
06:11:39.590 --> 06:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
I had my ID with me as an 18 year old
 
06:11:41.690 --> 06:11:41.700 align:start position:0%
who had a driver's license but I did not
 
06:11:43.970 --> 06:11:43.980 align:start position:0%
have anything to show my citizenship I
 
06:11:45.590 --> 06:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
didn't have a passport and I was not
 
06:11:47.510 --> 06:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
carrying around my birth certificate
 
06:11:49.670 --> 06:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
which I think my parents had in a
 
06:11:52.670 --> 06:11:52.680 align:start position:0%
firebox under lock and key so I signed
 
06:11:54.530 --> 06:11:54.540 align:start position:0%
an affidavit to show that I was a U.S
 
06:11:56.990 --> 06:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
citizen there's other countless stories
 
06:11:58.970 --> 06:11:58.980 align:start position:0%
like mine um and I know they've been
 
06:12:00.650 --> 06:12:00.660 align:start position:0%
talked about quite a bit today so
 
06:12:02.330 --> 06:12:02.340 align:start position:0%
instead I wanted to take a moment to
 
06:12:04.670 --> 06:12:04.680 align:start position:0%
discuss how unnecessary this legislation
 
06:12:07.670 --> 06:12:07.680 align:start position:0%
is especially in the light of the
 
06:12:09.890 --> 06:12:09.900 align:start position:0%
special committee on voter confidence
 
06:12:11.270 --> 06:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
um the Secretary of State put together
 
06:12:13.548 --> 06:12:13.558 align:start position:0%
last year and the New Hampshire campaign
 
06:12:14.930 --> 06:12:14.940 align:start position:0%
for voting rights really closely
 
06:12:18.288 --> 06:12:18.298 align:start position:0%
followed they had over 37 hours of
 
06:12:20.570 --> 06:12:20.580 align:start position:0%
meetings and public testimony
 
06:12:22.610 --> 06:12:22.620 align:start position:0%
um so and it was you know a bipartisan
 
06:12:26.270 --> 06:12:26.280 align:start position:0%
group and they had both folks come in
 
06:12:27.830 --> 06:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
from across the state and a presentation
 
06:12:29.930 --> 06:12:29.940 align:start position:0%
by the Attorney General's office so I
 
06:12:31.070 --> 06:12:31.080 align:start position:0%
wanted to just look back through the
 
06:12:33.110 --> 06:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
report today and wanted to share some of
 
06:12:34.910 --> 06:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
their findings which were created
 
06:12:37.190 --> 06:12:37.200 align:start position:0%
through bipartisan consensus and I think
 
06:12:38.810 --> 06:12:38.820 align:start position:0%
paint a really good picture about why
 
06:12:41.090 --> 06:12:41.100 align:start position:0%
this bill is not necessary so they
 
06:12:42.948 --> 06:12:42.958 align:start position:0%
include that most New Hampshire voters
 
06:12:44.930 --> 06:12:44.940 align:start position:0%
have confidence in our elections New
 
06:12:46.490 --> 06:12:46.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire elections are accurate and
 
06:12:47.990 --> 06:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
testimony from the Attorney General's
 
06:12:50.510 --> 06:12:50.520 align:start position:0%
office and others supports this finding
 
06:12:52.670 --> 06:12:52.680 align:start position:0%
there's no evidence of widespread
 
06:12:54.350 --> 06:12:54.360 align:start position:0%
election fraud in New Hampshire
 
06:12:56.810 --> 06:12:56.820 align:start position:0%
same day registration facilitates the
 
06:12:58.070 --> 06:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
ease of voting
 
06:13:00.350 --> 06:13:00.360 align:start position:0%
ongoing efforts are needed to serve all
 
06:13:02.330 --> 06:13:02.340 align:start position:0%
voters state and local election
 
06:13:04.310 --> 06:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
officials should make continuous efforts
 
06:13:06.470 --> 06:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
so all voters feel respected and
 
06:13:08.810 --> 06:13:08.820 align:start position:0%
included in the voting process including
 
06:13:10.670 --> 06:13:10.680 align:start position:0%
people with disabilities foreign
 
06:13:12.650 --> 06:13:12.660 align:start position:0%
language speaking voters and members of
 
06:13:14.930 --> 06:13:14.940 align:start position:0%
marginalized communities and their
 
06:13:16.910 --> 06:13:16.920 align:start position:0%
conclusion they said they're only rare
 
06:13:19.548 --> 06:13:19.558 align:start position:0%
and isolated incidence of fraud checks
 
06:13:22.128 --> 06:13:22.138 align:start position:0%
and balances are in place to deter and
 
06:13:24.350 --> 06:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
prevent such occurrences and processes
 
06:13:26.810 --> 06:13:26.820 align:start position:0%
exist to investigate in correct errors
 
06:13:29.270 --> 06:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
when they occur these findings are
 
06:13:30.410 --> 06:13:30.420 align:start position:0%
really clear that New Hampshire
 
06:13:32.868 --> 06:13:32.878 align:start position:0%
elections are accurate they are free of
 
06:13:35.090 --> 06:13:35.100 align:start position:0%
widespread fraud and this bill is really
 
06:13:37.368 --> 06:13:37.378 align:start position:0%
ins answer in search of a problem that
 
06:13:39.470 --> 06:13:39.480 align:start position:0%
does not exist New Hampshire voters have
 
06:13:41.030 --> 06:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
really high confidence in our elections
 
06:13:43.250 --> 06:13:43.260 align:start position:0%
and there are already important checks
 
06:13:45.650 --> 06:13:45.660 align:start position:0%
and processes to ensure that our
 
06:13:47.628 --> 06:13:47.638 align:start position:0%
elections continue to be accessible and
 
06:13:50.570 --> 06:13:50.580 align:start position:0%
accurate the only thing that HP 460 will
 
06:13:53.030 --> 06:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
do is disenfranchise voters not improve
 
06:13:55.070 --> 06:13:55.080 align:start position:0%
our elections thank you and I am happy
 
06:13:56.330 --> 06:13:56.340 align:start position:0%
to take any questions thank you we have
 
06:13:57.288 --> 06:13:57.298 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
06:14:00.110 --> 06:14:00.120 align:start position:0%
Catherine thank you Mr chairman
 
06:14:04.670 --> 06:14:04.680 align:start position:0%
uh my question is when you registered to
 
06:14:06.590 --> 06:14:06.600 align:start position:0%
vote did you register to vote in New
 
06:14:09.350 --> 06:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and if so was their follow-up
 
06:14:11.990 --> 06:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
on that citizenship uh so I did register
 
06:14:13.850 --> 06:14:13.860 align:start position:0%
to vote in New Hampshire I know from
 
06:14:16.250 --> 06:14:16.260 align:start position:0%
being involved that the Secretary of
 
06:14:17.810 --> 06:14:17.820 align:start position:0%
State's office looks into that process
 
06:14:20.150 --> 06:14:20.160 align:start position:0%
there was not personal follow-up for me
 
06:14:22.490 --> 06:14:22.500 align:start position:0%
on my citizenship
 
06:14:23.990 --> 06:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
um I used my New Hampshire driver's
 
06:14:27.890 --> 06:14:27.900 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:30.650 --> 06:14:30.660 align:start position:0%
thank any other questions
 
06:14:32.510 --> 06:14:32.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:14:34.670 --> 06:14:34.680 align:start position:0%
I now call and I don't want to butcher
 
06:14:41.690 --> 06:14:41.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:44.288 --> 06:14:44.298 align:start position:0%
people need to learn how to print
 
06:14:46.190 --> 06:14:46.200 align:start position:0%
I've been getting that since
 
06:14:46.200 --> 06:14:47.690 align:start position:0%
I've been getting that since
kindergarten

06:14:47.690 --> 06:14:47.700 align:start position:0%
kindergarten
 
06:14:49.430 --> 06:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
um good afternoon my name is Henry
 
06:14:51.350 --> 06:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
clementowicz I'm a lawyer with the
 
06:14:53.090 --> 06:14:53.100 align:start position:0%
American civil liberties Union of New
 
06:14:53.100 --> 06:14:54.368 align:start position:0%
American civil liberties Union of New
Hampshire

06:14:54.368 --> 06:14:54.378 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
06:14:56.810 --> 06:14:56.820 align:start position:0%
I've been involved in probably the last
 
06:14:58.548 --> 06:14:58.558 align:start position:0%
five or six pieces of election law
 
06:15:01.070 --> 06:15:01.080 align:start position:0%
litigation in New Hampshire and other
 
06:15:03.470 --> 06:15:03.480 align:start position:0%
people have talked about this bill so
 
06:15:05.150 --> 06:15:05.160 align:start position:0%
I'm I really just want to make three
 
06:15:07.270 --> 06:15:07.280 align:start position:0%
quick points if I may
 
06:15:09.708 --> 06:15:09.718 align:start position:0%
first I wanted to let the committee know
 
06:15:11.150 --> 06:15:11.160 align:start position:0%
how many people would be affected by
 
06:15:12.128 --> 06:15:12.138 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
06:15:14.330 --> 06:15:14.340 align:start position:0%
according to a right to know request
 
06:15:17.090 --> 06:15:17.100 align:start position:0%
response from the Secretary of State in
 
06:15:17.100 --> 06:15:18.410 align:start position:0%
response from the Secretary of State in
2022

06:15:18.410 --> 06:15:18.420 align:start position:0%
2022
 
06:15:20.510 --> 06:15:20.520 align:start position:0%
at the general election so that's a
 
06:15:22.510 --> 06:15:22.520 align:start position:0%
midterm election
 
06:15:25.670 --> 06:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
739 voters use the qualified voter
 
06:15:27.788 --> 06:15:27.798 align:start position:0%
affidavit to prove citizenship
 
06:15:30.410 --> 06:15:30.420 align:start position:0%
219 voters use the qualified voter
 
06:15:33.890 --> 06:15:33.900 align:start position:0%
affidavit to prove identity in 1643
 
06:15:35.990 --> 06:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
voters use the domicile affidavit so
 
06:15:39.230 --> 06:15:39.240 align:start position:0%
that's about 25 100 people in a midterm
 
06:15:41.868 --> 06:15:41.878 align:start position:0%
election who would potentially be not
 
06:15:45.048 --> 06:15:45.058 align:start position:0%
able to vote if this Bill had been law
 
06:15:46.670 --> 06:15:46.680 align:start position:0%
at the time because they would not have
 
06:15:49.430 --> 06:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
been allowed to register uh not having
 
06:15:51.830 --> 06:15:51.840 align:start position:0%
those documents we've also been talking
 
06:15:54.470 --> 06:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
about this bill largely as a voter ID
 
06:15:56.510 --> 06:15:56.520 align:start position:0%
bill and I think it's worth pointing out
 
06:15:58.788 --> 06:15:58.798 align:start position:0%
that one of the more pernicious aspects
 
06:16:00.288 --> 06:16:00.298 align:start position:0%
of this bill is the way that it treats
 
06:16:03.830 --> 06:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
citizenship which is I in my opinion the
 
06:16:06.170 --> 06:16:06.180 align:start position:0%
the qualification for voting that's most
 
06:16:08.270 --> 06:16:08.280 align:start position:0%
difficult to prove
 
06:16:10.430 --> 06:16:10.440 align:start position:0%
um the statute and I know representative
 
06:16:12.890 --> 06:16:12.900 align:start position:0%
Barry isn't here but uh I did get an
 
06:16:15.048 --> 06:16:15.058 align:start position:0%
answer to his question both under
 
06:16:17.208 --> 06:16:17.218 align:start position:0%
current law and on under this proposed
 
06:16:19.970 --> 06:16:19.980 align:start position:0%
Bill reasonable proof of of citizenship
 
06:16:22.430 --> 06:16:22.440 align:start position:0%
is allowed the problem is that other
 
06:16:24.590 --> 06:16:24.600 align:start position:0%
than a birth certificate and a passport
 
06:16:26.628 --> 06:16:26.638 align:start position:0%
and Naturalization paper there really
 
06:16:28.310 --> 06:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
aren't other documents that people have
 
06:16:30.650 --> 06:16:30.660 align:start position:0%
to prove citizenship you don't need to
 
06:16:32.448 --> 06:16:32.458 align:start position:0%
be a United States citizen to get a
 
06:16:34.610 --> 06:16:34.620 align:start position:0%
driver's license in New Hampshire or in
 
06:16:36.410 --> 06:16:36.420 align:start position:0%
Most states so that's that's not proof
 
06:16:38.090 --> 06:16:38.100 align:start position:0%
you really need either a birth
 
06:16:39.830 --> 06:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
certificate or a passport
 
06:16:42.288 --> 06:16:42.298 align:start position:0%
it costs a hundred and ten dollars to
 
06:16:44.690 --> 06:16:44.700 align:start position:0%
get a new passport book and routine
 
06:16:48.110 --> 06:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
service takes 10 to 12 weeks the time
 
06:16:49.910 --> 06:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
and cost to acquire a birth certificate
 
06:16:52.310 --> 06:16:52.320 align:start position:0%
depends on where you're born in New
 
06:16:54.128 --> 06:16:54.138 align:start position:0%
Hampshire a birth certificate costs 15
 
06:16:56.510 --> 06:16:56.520 align:start position:0%
but if you are an American who is born
 
06:16:59.208 --> 06:16:59.218 align:start position:0%
abroad and thus a natural born American
 
06:17:01.850 --> 06:17:01.860 align:start position:0%
uh it requires fifty dollars and a
 
06:17:03.170 --> 06:17:03.180 align:start position:0%
notarized request to the state
 
06:17:05.810 --> 06:17:05.820 align:start position:0%
department I I can only assume uh that
 
06:17:07.250 --> 06:17:07.260 align:start position:0%
that process is pretty time intensive
 
06:17:09.170 --> 06:17:09.180 align:start position:0%
too and those are the only ways that you
 
06:17:11.270 --> 06:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
can prove citizenship that's probably
 
06:17:14.570 --> 06:17:14.580 align:start position:0%
why in 2020 the 10th circuit in a case
 
06:17:17.330 --> 06:17:17.340 align:start position:0%
called fish versus Schwab struck down a
 
06:17:20.330 --> 06:17:20.340 align:start position:0%
similar Kansas laws unconstitutional uh
 
06:17:24.110 --> 06:17:24.120 align:start position:0%
finding that uh the state's requirement
 
06:17:25.970 --> 06:17:25.980 align:start position:0%
for what they call documentary proof of
 
06:17:28.250 --> 06:17:28.260 align:start position:0%
citizenship the state's interests were
 
06:17:30.110 --> 06:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
insufficiently waiting to justify the
 
06:17:32.390 --> 06:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
limitations on the right to vote imposed
 
06:17:35.750 --> 06:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
by that requirement and in 2020 the
 
06:17:38.208 --> 06:17:38.218 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court decline cert so that's the
 
06:17:39.830 --> 06:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
last case I was able to find it's two
 
06:17:41.170 --> 06:17:41.180 align:start position:0%
years old
 
06:17:44.330 --> 06:17:44.340 align:start position:0%
saying that this type of citizenship
 
06:17:46.490 --> 06:17:46.500 align:start position:0%
proof requirement is unconstitutional
 
06:17:48.110 --> 06:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
finally I just want to hit on the
 
06:17:49.910 --> 06:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
challenges again
 
06:17:49.920 --> 06:17:50.510 align:start position:0%
challenges again
um

06:17:50.510 --> 06:17:50.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:17:52.788 --> 06:17:52.798 align:start position:0%
I respectfully I differ from
 
06:17:54.830 --> 06:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn in terms of what
 
06:17:56.208 --> 06:17:56.218 align:start position:0%
this bill would do to challenges I think
 
06:17:58.310 --> 06:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
the biggest change is that under current
 
06:18:00.590 --> 06:18:00.600 align:start position:0%
law if a voter is challenged and the
 
06:18:01.910 --> 06:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
challenge is well grounded they're
 
06:18:03.410 --> 06:18:03.420 align:start position:0%
allowed to vote if they execute the
 
06:18:04.788 --> 06:18:04.798 align:start position:0%
challenged voter affidavit that's
 
06:18:06.410 --> 06:18:06.420 align:start position:0%
actually why the challenge voter
 
06:18:08.690 --> 06:18:08.700 align:start position:0%
affidavit was created under this statute
 
06:18:11.230 --> 06:18:11.240 align:start position:0%
however uh if it were to become law
 
06:18:14.810 --> 06:18:14.820 align:start position:0%
under a well-challenged a well-founded
 
06:18:16.610 --> 06:18:16.620 align:start position:0%
challenge the voter would not be allowed
 
06:18:18.650 --> 06:18:18.660 align:start position:0%
to vote so basically what happens is you
 
06:18:21.110 --> 06:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
have moderators and supervisors of the
 
06:18:21.120 --> 06:18:22.310 align:start position:0%
have moderators and supervisors of the
checklist

06:18:22.310 --> 06:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
checklist
 
06:18:24.288 --> 06:18:24.298 align:start position:0%
using What's called the preponderance of
 
06:18:25.670 --> 06:18:25.680 align:start position:0%
the evidence standard which is one of
 
06:18:27.230 --> 06:18:27.240 align:start position:0%
the lowest standards we have in the law
 
06:18:29.270 --> 06:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
to determine whether a person can vote
 
06:18:32.690 --> 06:18:32.700 align:start position:0%
or not with I think many lacking due
 
06:18:34.910 --> 06:18:34.920 align:start position:0%
process protection so there's no
 
06:18:36.830 --> 06:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
guaranteed opportunity for the voter to
 
06:18:38.868 --> 06:18:38.878 align:start position:0%
introduce Witnesses or evidence no
 
06:18:42.010 --> 06:18:42.020 align:start position:0%
advance notice no right to an attorney
 
06:18:45.110 --> 06:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
no provision for a neutral fact finder
 
06:18:46.730 --> 06:18:46.740 align:start position:0%
in the event that the supervisor of the
 
06:18:49.788 --> 06:18:49.798 align:start position:0%
checklist or moderator is conflicted and
 
06:18:51.788 --> 06:18:51.798 align:start position:0%
no meaningful right of judicial review
 
06:18:53.810 --> 06:18:53.820 align:start position:0%
representative Lin is right that this
 
06:18:55.970 --> 06:18:55.980 align:start position:0%
does introduce and appeal to Superior
 
06:18:59.208 --> 06:18:59.218 align:start position:0%
Court but the very the very shortest
 
06:19:00.708 --> 06:19:00.718 align:start position:0%
period of time I've ever seen a court
 
06:19:04.010 --> 06:19:04.020 align:start position:0%
take is in a matter of hours as noted
 
06:19:05.510 --> 06:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
before the courts closed about three
 
06:19:07.128 --> 06:19:07.138 align:start position:0%
hours before the polls close in Most
 
06:19:10.850 --> 06:19:10.860 align:start position:0%
states and the the current cost to file
 
06:19:14.270 --> 06:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
an appeal in Superior Court is 280 which
 
06:19:15.650 --> 06:19:15.660 align:start position:0%
is a lot of money for someone to have to
 
06:19:17.150 --> 06:19:17.160 align:start position:0%
pay if they're
 
06:19:17.160 --> 06:19:17.750 align:start position:0%
pay if they're
um

06:19:17.750 --> 06:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:19:19.670 --> 06:19:19.680 align:start position:0%
just to vote if a challenge against them
 
06:19:22.310 --> 06:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
was well deemed well-pounded so
 
06:19:25.070 --> 06:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
um I'm happy to take questions
 
06:19:26.810 --> 06:19:26.820 align:start position:0%
um if there are any but I I think that
 
06:19:28.368 --> 06:19:28.378 align:start position:0%
there's a number of reasons why this is
 
06:19:30.708 --> 06:19:30.718 align:start position:0%
better more ahead
 
06:19:32.270 --> 06:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:19:35.030 --> 06:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
um you your numbers on a number of
 
06:19:36.830 --> 06:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
Voters uh your statistics on the numbers
 
06:19:38.868 --> 06:19:38.878 align:start position:0%
of Voters who use the qualified voter
 
06:19:41.628 --> 06:19:41.638 align:start position:0%
affidavit did that include people using
 
06:19:43.010 --> 06:19:43.020 align:start position:0%
those affidavits who are same-day
 
06:19:45.170 --> 06:19:45.180 align:start position:0%
registrants it was that's a great
 
06:19:46.850 --> 06:19:46.860 align:start position:0%
question and that was
 
06:19:49.070 --> 06:19:49.080 align:start position:0%
um it was anyone who executed one of
 
06:19:51.830 --> 06:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
those affidavits in 2022. I assume it
 
06:19:53.930 --> 06:19:53.940 align:start position:0%
was I assume but don't know that it was
 
06:19:55.970 --> 06:19:55.980 align:start position:0%
mostly same-day registrants because
 
06:19:58.250 --> 06:19:58.260 align:start position:0%
that's when most registrations happen I
 
06:19:59.810 --> 06:19:59.820 align:start position:0%
should say you can also use the
 
06:20:01.670 --> 06:20:01.680 align:start position:0%
qualified voter affidavit to prove age
 
06:20:04.548 --> 06:20:04.558 align:start position:0%
which is the easiest I think
 
06:20:06.288 --> 06:20:06.298 align:start position:0%
um qualification approved but the
 
06:20:07.430 --> 06:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
secretary of state does not keep track
 
06:20:09.490 --> 06:20:09.500 align:start position:0%
of how many people do that
 
06:20:11.990 --> 06:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
and and this bill does not address
 
06:20:14.930 --> 06:20:14.940 align:start position:0%
same-day voter registration is that
 
06:20:16.490 --> 06:20:16.500 align:start position:0%
correct my understanding is that this
 
06:20:18.470 --> 06:20:18.480 align:start position:0%
bill would have the same effects on
 
06:20:20.270 --> 06:20:20.280 align:start position:0%
people regardless of when and where they
 
06:20:22.208 --> 06:20:22.218 align:start position:0%
registered to vote
 
06:20:25.010 --> 06:20:25.020 align:start position:0%
last one okay is this one is this bill
 
06:20:27.708 --> 06:20:27.718 align:start position:0%
addresses you know RSA 65412 my
 
06:20:29.750 --> 06:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
understanding is that IT addresses those
 
06:20:31.970 --> 06:20:31.980 align:start position:0%
who are registering to vote
 
06:20:34.970 --> 06:20:34.980 align:start position:0%
um mostly 30 days before an election not
 
06:20:36.650 --> 06:20:36.660 align:start position:0%
those who are voting on the day of
 
06:20:37.910 --> 06:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
election is that your understanding well
 
06:20:39.890 --> 06:20:39.900 align:start position:0%
I I think it's a little bit complicated
 
06:20:41.390 --> 06:20:41.400 align:start position:0%
because some of the language that was
 
06:20:43.430 --> 06:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
put in this bill was drawn from the sp3
 
06:20:45.890 --> 06:20:45.900 align:start position:0%
case which is currently in the statutes
 
06:20:47.810 --> 06:20:47.820 align:start position:0%
but is subject to an injunction by the
 
06:20:49.250 --> 06:20:49.260 align:start position:0%
courts and so I think it was kind of
 
06:20:49.260 --> 06:20:50.990 align:start position:0%
courts and so I think it was kind of
reincorporating

06:20:50.990 --> 06:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
reincorporating
 
06:20:53.150 --> 06:20:53.160 align:start position:0%
dead law if that makes sense I'm not
 
06:20:55.670 --> 06:20:55.680 align:start position:0%
sure whether the intent was to only
 
06:20:58.970 --> 06:20:58.980 align:start position:0%
apply outside the 30 days but currently
 
06:21:00.048 --> 06:21:00.058 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire doesn't draw that
 
06:21:01.788 --> 06:21:01.798 align:start position:0%
distinction because of the New Hampshire
 
06:21:03.410 --> 06:21:03.420 align:start position:0%
Democratic party versus Secretary of
 
06:21:05.448 --> 06:21:05.458 align:start position:0%
State kiss thank you
 
06:21:07.850 --> 06:21:07.860 align:start position:0%
let me know Howard
 
06:21:11.570 --> 06:21:11.580 align:start position:0%
so uh thank you uh Mr chair and uh thank
 
06:21:14.448 --> 06:21:14.458 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question uh so you you
 
06:21:16.368 --> 06:21:16.378 align:start position:0%
had mentioned uh that there could be
 
06:21:19.250 --> 06:21:19.260 align:start position:0%
somebody an individual who could go to a
 
06:21:23.628 --> 06:21:23.638 align:start position:0%
superior court uh and file a a a a
 
06:21:28.128 --> 06:21:28.138 align:start position:0%
reversal of the uh of of their ballot uh
 
06:21:31.548 --> 06:21:31.558 align:start position:0%
so uh how many Courts are there in the
 
06:21:34.190 --> 06:21:34.200 align:start position:0%
State uh that could hear this cave well
 
06:21:36.410 --> 06:21:36.420 align:start position:0%
I think it's a the superior court and
 
06:21:38.150 --> 06:21:38.160 align:start position:0%
there are 11 Superior Courts in the
 
06:21:38.160 --> 06:21:42.170 align:start position:0%
there are 11 Superior Courts in the
state

06:21:42.170 --> 06:21:42.180 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:44.750 --> 06:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
any further questions okay thank you
 
06:21:46.910 --> 06:21:46.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:21:51.708 --> 06:21:51.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:00.948 --> 06:22:00.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:04.570 --> 06:22:04.580 align:start position:0%
smooshian you did great thank you
 
06:22:06.650 --> 06:22:06.660 align:start position:0%
uh good afternoon members of the
 
06:22:09.590 --> 06:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
committee uh my name is Matt mushian I
 
06:22:11.208 --> 06:22:11.218 align:start position:0%
live in Claremont where I serve as a
 
06:22:13.128 --> 06:22:13.138 align:start position:0%
city councilor and today I'm here
 
06:22:16.510 --> 06:22:16.520 align:start position:0%
representing 603 Ford a nonpartisan
 
06:22:19.190 --> 06:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
non-profit organization dedicated to
 
06:22:21.708 --> 06:22:21.718 align:start position:0%
educating activating and empowering
 
06:22:23.990 --> 06:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
young people in our state
 
06:22:26.690 --> 06:22:26.700 align:start position:0%
I'm here today to testify in opposition
 
06:22:29.628 --> 06:22:29.638 align:start position:0%
of House Bill 460 which would eliminate
 
06:22:31.368 --> 06:22:31.378 align:start position:0%
the ability to register to vote by
 
06:22:34.368 --> 06:22:34.378 align:start position:0%
assigned affidavit as you've heard today
 
06:22:36.350 --> 06:22:36.360 align:start position:0%
this is a bill in search of a problem
 
06:22:40.430 --> 06:22:40.440 align:start position:0%
we've seen numerous studies reports and
 
06:22:43.010 --> 06:22:43.020 align:start position:0%
investigations that have all confirmed
 
06:22:45.590 --> 06:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire elections are safe
 
06:22:47.510 --> 06:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
and secure and that our existing
 
06:22:49.628 --> 06:22:49.638 align:start position:0%
affidavit system works
 
06:22:52.548 --> 06:22:52.558 align:start position:0%
6034 it opposes this legislation because
 
06:22:55.250 --> 06:22:55.260 align:start position:0%
it will disproportionately negatively
 
06:22:57.350 --> 06:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
impact the right to vote for young
 
06:22:57.360 --> 06:22:58.610 align:start position:0%
impact the right to vote for young
voters

06:22:58.610 --> 06:22:58.620 align:start position:0%
voters
 
06:23:00.410 --> 06:23:00.420 align:start position:0%
which is why I urge the committee to
 
06:23:02.390 --> 06:23:02.400 align:start position:0%
vote in expedient to legislate on House
 
06:23:04.490 --> 06:23:04.500 align:start position:0%
Bill 460.
 
06:23:08.090 --> 06:23:08.100 align:start position:0%
when I was 18 uh in College at New
 
06:23:10.670 --> 06:23:10.680 align:start position:0%
England College I wanted to register and
 
06:23:12.530 --> 06:23:12.540 align:start position:0%
vote in the election just like anybody
 
06:23:15.530 --> 06:23:15.540 align:start position:0%
else but all I had with me was my state
 
06:23:18.048 --> 06:23:18.058 align:start position:0%
issued driver's license which would not
 
06:23:20.030 --> 06:23:20.040 align:start position:0%
count as proof of citizenship
 
06:23:22.970 --> 06:23:22.980 align:start position:0%
luckily I was able to sign an affidavit
 
06:23:24.890 --> 06:23:24.900 align:start position:0%
to prove that I was a citizen and I was
 
06:23:27.230 --> 06:23:27.240 align:start position:0%
able to cast my ballot under this new
 
06:23:29.390 --> 06:23:29.400 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation I would have not
 
06:23:31.610 --> 06:23:31.620 align:start position:0%
been able to sign the affidavit and I
 
06:23:33.048 --> 06:23:33.058 align:start position:0%
would have been turned away without
 
06:23:33.058 --> 06:23:35.690 align:start position:0%
would have been turned away without
voting

06:23:35.690 --> 06:23:35.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:37.670 --> 06:23:37.680 align:start position:0%
the problem is that this legislation
 
06:23:39.590 --> 06:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't just attack the right to vote
 
06:23:42.170 --> 06:23:42.180 align:start position:0%
for young voters and student voters but
 
06:23:44.510 --> 06:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
also new Americans people experiencing
 
06:23:48.230 --> 06:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
homelessness and the elderly
 
06:23:50.750 --> 06:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
I've worked at my local polling location
 
06:23:53.448 --> 06:23:53.458 align:start position:0%
before and I've seen how common it can
 
06:23:55.670 --> 06:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
be for someone to forget or to simply
 
06:23:58.250 --> 06:23:58.260 align:start position:0%
not have a proper proof they need but
 
06:24:00.410 --> 06:24:00.420 align:start position:0%
I've also seen how hard our election
 
06:24:02.930 --> 06:24:02.940 align:start position:0%
officials work to keep our elections
 
06:24:05.208 --> 06:24:05.218 align:start position:0%
safe and secure
 
06:24:07.490 --> 06:24:07.500 align:start position:0%
you've heard them today and there are
 
06:24:10.788 --> 06:24:10.798 align:start position:0%
legitimate concerns about House Bill 460
 
06:24:13.310 --> 06:24:13.320 align:start position:0%
and its impact on granite Staters
 
06:24:15.410 --> 06:24:15.420 align:start position:0%
exercising their constitutional right to
 
06:24:17.390 --> 06:24:17.400 align:start position:0%
vote and this committee should listen
 
06:24:19.970 --> 06:24:19.980 align:start position:0%
and take heat of them
 
06:24:22.150 --> 06:24:22.160 align:start position:0%
furthermore this body should be
 
06:24:25.250 --> 06:24:25.260 align:start position:0%
prioritizing policies like implementing
 
06:24:28.490 --> 06:24:28.500 align:start position:0%
an online voter registration becoming a
 
06:24:30.410 --> 06:24:30.420 align:start position:0%
member state of the electronic
 
06:24:33.048 --> 06:24:33.058 align:start position:0%
registration information Set uh
 
06:24:36.410 --> 06:24:36.420 align:start position:0%
Center and really dedicate its focus to
 
06:24:39.048 --> 06:24:39.058 align:start position:0%
making more secure while efficient
 
06:24:41.990 --> 06:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
elections for people to participate and
 
06:24:44.090 --> 06:24:44.100 align:start position:0%
what is the Bedrock of our democracy are
 
06:24:46.310 --> 06:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
free and fair elections so I ask you
 
06:24:48.230 --> 06:24:48.240 align:start position:0%
please vote and expedient to legislate
 
06:24:50.810 --> 06:24:50.820 align:start position:0%
on how to spell 460.
 
06:24:52.430 --> 06:24:52.440 align:start position:0%
and I I can't take questions because I
 
06:24:53.570 --> 06:24:53.580 align:start position:0%
have to run back for city council
 
06:24:57.830 --> 06:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:09.530 --> 06:25:09.540 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:11.390 --> 06:25:11.400 align:start position:0%
uh good afternoon chairman members of
 
06:25:13.368 --> 06:25:13.378 align:start position:0%
the committee I'll keep this brief my
 
06:25:14.868 --> 06:25:14.878 align:start position:0%
name is Lucas Meyer I live in Manchester
 
06:25:16.730 --> 06:25:16.740 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I'm here representing
 
06:25:19.788 --> 06:25:19.798 align:start position:0%
myself but I am also the co-founder and
 
06:25:22.850 --> 06:25:22.860 align:start position:0%
board chair of 603 forward I just hope
 
06:25:24.830 --> 06:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
it is not lost on the committee that
 
06:25:27.288 --> 06:25:27.298 align:start position:0%
today there is a special election in
 
06:25:30.288 --> 06:25:30.298 align:start position:0%
Rochester where SB 418 for the first
 
06:25:32.868 --> 06:25:32.878 align:start position:0%
time is being implemented no shorter
 
06:25:34.970 --> 06:25:34.980 align:start position:0%
than a week in change after that
 
06:25:37.128 --> 06:25:37.138 align:start position:0%
guidance was sent to local election
 
06:25:39.708 --> 06:25:39.718 align:start position:0%
officials I think we look at the intent
 
06:25:41.570 --> 06:25:41.580 align:start position:0%
of this bill about improving voter
 
06:25:43.990 --> 06:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
confidence and we look at the good work
 
06:25:46.310 --> 06:25:46.320 align:start position:0%
that the Secretary of State's committee
 
06:25:47.868 --> 06:25:47.878 align:start position:0%
on voter confidence did over the summer
 
06:25:50.570 --> 06:25:50.580 align:start position:0%
and the emphasis that was placed on
 
06:25:52.310 --> 06:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
supporting our local election officials
 
06:25:55.250 --> 06:25:55.260 align:start position:0%
and ceasing this game of moving the goal
 
06:25:57.708 --> 06:25:57.718 align:start position:0%
posts on them year after year
 
06:25:59.330 --> 06:25:59.340 align:start position:0%
I think is really striking when you
 
06:26:01.310 --> 06:26:01.320 align:start position:0%
consider the sponsor of this bill was
 
06:26:03.890 --> 06:26:03.900 align:start position:0%
also the sponsor of SB 418 and he is now
 
06:26:06.410 --> 06:26:06.420 align:start position:0%
looking to change what has already
 
06:26:09.708 --> 06:26:09.718 align:start position:0%
implemented an SB 418 just a year later
 
06:26:12.470 --> 06:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
and today the day that law is first
 
06:26:15.410 --> 06:26:15.420 align:start position:0%
being put into place so I think that is
 
06:26:16.970 --> 06:26:16.980 align:start position:0%
important context as we have this
 
06:26:20.090 --> 06:26:20.100 align:start position:0%
conversation secondly we look to the
 
06:26:22.010 --> 06:26:22.020 align:start position:0%
intent of this bill and the purpose of
 
06:26:24.770 --> 06:26:24.780 align:start position:0%
this bill which assuming best intentions
 
06:26:27.410 --> 06:26:27.420 align:start position:0%
which I will indulge for the moment is
 
06:26:29.510 --> 06:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
to improve voter confidence in New
 
06:26:33.170 --> 06:26:33.180 align:start position:0%
Hampshire elections the supposition is
 
06:26:36.110 --> 06:26:36.120 align:start position:0%
that there is perhaps not recorded but
 
06:26:38.090 --> 06:26:38.100 align:start position:0%
voter fraud or voter impropriety
 
06:26:40.190 --> 06:26:40.200 align:start position:0%
happening in New Hampshire and that we
 
06:26:42.830 --> 06:26:42.840 align:start position:0%
need more data to find it we just had
 
06:26:46.190 --> 06:26:46.200 align:start position:0%
the ACLU testify to the raw numbers of
 
06:26:48.530 --> 06:26:48.540 align:start position:0%
folks who'd be disenfranchised by this
 
06:26:50.628 --> 06:26:50.638 align:start position:0%
but we don't have data about what some
 
06:26:53.270 --> 06:26:53.280 align:start position:0%
of the sponsors theorize for what there
 
06:26:55.430 --> 06:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
is for improper voting in New Hampshire
 
06:26:58.368 --> 06:26:58.378 align:start position:0%
and I would urge this committee that if
 
06:27:01.190 --> 06:27:01.200 align:start position:0%
that is the sincere purpose and intent
 
06:27:03.288 --> 06:27:03.298 align:start position:0%
to find in the state
 
06:27:06.770 --> 06:27:06.780 align:start position:0%
cases of possible voter fraud that this
 
06:27:09.110 --> 06:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
committee make a movement for New
 
06:27:10.490 --> 06:27:10.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to join the electronic
 
06:27:12.890 --> 06:27:12.900 align:start position:0%
registration information center and
 
06:27:15.470 --> 06:27:15.480 align:start position:0%
let's apply some real data to this
 
06:27:15.480 --> 06:27:16.490 align:start position:0%
let's apply some real data to this
debate

06:27:16.490 --> 06:27:16.500 align:start position:0%
debate
 
06:27:20.208 --> 06:27:20.218 align:start position:0%
if you look at where a majority of
 
06:27:22.490 --> 06:27:22.500 align:start position:0%
out-of-state IDs are used to register in
 
06:27:24.948 --> 06:27:24.958 align:start position:0%
the state usually same day and you look
 
06:27:27.110 --> 06:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
at the member states of Eric the
 
06:27:28.430 --> 06:27:28.440 align:start position:0%
electronic registration information
 
06:27:31.850 --> 06:27:31.860 align:start position:0%
center there is a striking overlap
 
06:27:35.390 --> 06:27:35.400 align:start position:0%
between those States meaning after an
 
06:27:37.490 --> 06:27:37.500 align:start position:0%
election New Hampshire along with 32
 
06:27:39.170 --> 06:27:39.180 align:start position:0%
other States including Washington DC
 
06:27:42.350 --> 06:27:42.360 align:start position:0%
would be able to receive a report
 
06:27:44.750 --> 06:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
for anyone who had moved out of state to
 
06:27:46.070 --> 06:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
06:27:48.708 --> 06:27:48.718 align:start position:0%
or within New Hampshire's border or who
 
06:27:50.930 --> 06:27:50.940 align:start position:0%
had died or changed address and we would
 
06:27:53.510 --> 06:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
have that information sent to us so we
 
06:27:56.270 --> 06:27:56.280 align:start position:0%
would no longer have to wonder who is
 
06:27:58.250 --> 06:27:58.260 align:start position:0%
this person who showed up same day maybe
 
06:28:00.830 --> 06:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
they voted in Massachusetts too we would
 
06:28:02.330 --> 06:28:02.340 align:start position:0%
have the data
 
06:28:05.030 --> 06:28:05.040 align:start position:0%
to show everybody in this state if that
 
06:28:07.430 --> 06:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
was true or not now I am a particular
 
06:28:09.230 --> 06:28:09.240 align:start position:0%
proponent of this as a voting rights
 
06:28:11.510 --> 06:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
Advocate because I would like to put
 
06:28:13.670 --> 06:28:13.680 align:start position:0%
some data down on paper let's have an
 
06:28:15.288 --> 06:28:15.298 align:start position:0%
honest debate about what is happening in
 
06:28:17.150 --> 06:28:17.160 align:start position:0%
this state and let's look
 
06:28:20.810 --> 06:28:20.820 align:start position:0%
at what's happening now
 
06:28:23.510 --> 06:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
we can do this we actually don't have to
 
06:28:25.788 --> 06:28:25.798 align:start position:0%
pass a bill to join Eric the Secretary
 
06:28:29.150 --> 06:28:29.160 align:start position:0%
of State could do that himself today uh
 
06:28:32.270 --> 06:28:32.280 align:start position:0%
I do not often agree with the governor
 
06:28:34.310 --> 06:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
of Florida on issues of voting rights
 
06:28:37.070 --> 06:28:37.080 align:start position:0%
but I do agree with him that their that
 
06:28:38.930 --> 06:28:38.940 align:start position:0%
joining Eric is a smart thing for a
 
06:28:40.368 --> 06:28:40.378 align:start position:0%
state to do which is why Republican
 
06:28:42.048 --> 06:28:42.058 align:start position:0%
states and Democratic states have joined
 
06:28:45.650 --> 06:28:45.660 align:start position:0%
it so before we yet again
 
06:28:49.070 --> 06:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
seek to confuse and complicate the same
 
06:28:50.750 --> 06:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
day voter registration process because
 
06:28:53.150 --> 06:28:53.160 align:start position:0%
last year it was 4 18 this year it is
 
06:28:55.010 --> 06:28:55.020 align:start position:0%
this bill next year it will be a
 
06:28:56.390 --> 06:28:56.400 align:start position:0%
different bill just to get rid of it
 
06:28:56.400 --> 06:28:58.010 align:start position:0%
different bill just to get rid of it
entirely

06:28:58.010 --> 06:28:58.020 align:start position:0%
entirely
 
06:29:00.890 --> 06:29:00.900 align:start position:0%
before we have that debate let's join
 
06:29:03.590 --> 06:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
Eric let's add some confidence to our
 
06:29:05.330 --> 06:29:05.340 align:start position:0%
elections let's stop moving the goal
 
06:29:06.650 --> 06:29:06.660 align:start position:0%
post on our local election officials
 
06:29:08.030 --> 06:29:08.040 align:start position:0%
must have an honest conversation about
 
06:29:08.040 --> 06:29:08.868 align:start position:0%
must have an honest conversation about
this

06:29:08.868 --> 06:29:08.878 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:29:10.730 --> 06:29:10.740 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:29:12.530 --> 06:29:12.540 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
06:29:15.288 --> 06:29:15.298 align:start position:0%
good thank you thank you
 
06:29:17.208 --> 06:29:17.218 align:start position:0%
last card
 
06:29:27.890 --> 06:29:27.900 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:31.430 --> 06:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:34.070 --> 06:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thank you my name is
 
06:29:35.810 --> 06:29:35.820 align:start position:0%
David Trumbull I'm from where in New
 
06:29:35.820 --> 06:29:36.650 align:start position:0%
David Trumbull I'm from where in New
Hampshire

06:29:36.650 --> 06:29:36.660 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
06:29:39.530 --> 06:29:39.540 align:start position:0%
I was a candidate for State Rep this
 
06:29:41.690 --> 06:29:41.700 align:start position:0%
past term I did not win but I'm still
 
06:29:43.070 --> 06:29:43.080 align:start position:0%
very interested in the issues going
 
06:29:45.350 --> 06:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
forward I'm opposed to this bill for
 
06:29:47.868 --> 06:29:47.878 align:start position:0%
three reasons first voting is a
 
06:29:49.788 --> 06:29:49.798 align:start position:0%
fundamental right and it's not just any
 
06:29:51.170 --> 06:29:51.180 align:start position:0%
old fundamental right it's the
 
06:29:53.208 --> 06:29:53.218 align:start position:0%
fundamental right that upholds every
 
06:29:55.910 --> 06:29:55.920 align:start position:0%
other single right that we have this is
 
06:29:57.470 --> 06:29:57.480 align:start position:0%
from a case that was mentioned earlier
 
06:29:59.270 --> 06:29:59.280 align:start position:0%
today Harper versus the Virginia State
 
06:30:01.690 --> 06:30:01.700 align:start position:0%
Board of Elections U.S Supreme Court
 
06:30:05.270 --> 06:30:05.280 align:start position:0%
1966 Justice Douglas he said that the
 
06:30:06.890 --> 06:30:06.900 align:start position:0%
court referred to voting as a
 
06:30:09.708 --> 06:30:09.718 align:start position:0%
fundamental political right especially
 
06:30:11.510 --> 06:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
since the right to exercise the
 
06:30:13.548 --> 06:30:13.558 align:start position:0%
franchise in a free and unimpaired
 
06:30:16.788 --> 06:30:16.798 align:start position:0%
manner is preservative of other basic
 
06:30:19.610 --> 06:30:19.620 align:start position:0%
civil and political rights any alleged
 
06:30:21.530 --> 06:30:21.540 align:start position:0%
infringement of the right of citizens to
 
06:30:24.190 --> 06:30:24.200 align:start position:0%
vote must be carefully and meticulously
 
06:30:26.810 --> 06:30:26.820 align:start position:0%
scrutinized so if you want to pass this
 
06:30:29.448 --> 06:30:29.458 align:start position:0%
bill today you have to have it be
 
06:30:31.310 --> 06:30:31.320 align:start position:0%
definitely proven that there's a need
 
06:30:33.530 --> 06:30:33.540 align:start position:0%
for this bill and the testimony has been
 
06:30:36.230 --> 06:30:36.240 align:start position:0%
that there is no need for this bill the
 
06:30:37.850 --> 06:30:37.860 align:start position:0%
second reason I impose this bill is that
 
06:30:39.350 --> 06:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is the most difficult
 
06:30:41.650 --> 06:30:41.660 align:start position:0%
state to vote in in the United States
 
06:30:44.208 --> 06:30:44.218 align:start position:0%
there is a survey that is done every
 
06:30:46.070 --> 06:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
year and updated it's called the cost of
 
06:30:48.110 --> 06:30:48.120 align:start position:0%
voting in the American states and it's
 
06:30:50.208 --> 06:30:50.218 align:start position:0%
reported in the election Law Journal in
 
06:30:52.448 --> 06:30:52.458 align:start position:0%
September of 2022 they wrote this
 
06:30:55.610 --> 06:30:55.620 align:start position:0%
Mississippi in 49th Place in New
 
06:30:58.610 --> 06:30:58.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire 50th stay at the bottom of the
 
06:31:00.830 --> 06:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
rankings as the most difficult States
 
06:31:03.770 --> 06:31:03.780 align:start position:0%
for voting their failure to move is
 
06:31:05.990 --> 06:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
large moving up the rankings is largely
 
06:31:08.570 --> 06:31:08.580 align:start position:0%
due to these states failing to keep Pace
 
06:31:11.448 --> 06:31:11.458 align:start position:0%
with reforms like online voter
 
06:31:14.208 --> 06:31:14.218 align:start position:0%
registration no excuse absentee voting
 
06:31:16.430 --> 06:31:16.440 align:start position:0%
an automatic voter registration which
 
06:31:18.590 --> 06:31:18.600 align:start position:0%
have taken place in other states we're
 
06:31:20.750 --> 06:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
not keeping Pace the reason this bill
 
06:31:23.390 --> 06:31:23.400 align:start position:0%
was presented in other bills like it is
 
06:31:25.670 --> 06:31:25.680 align:start position:0%
to create the mindset that we have a
 
06:31:27.948 --> 06:31:27.958 align:start position:0%
voting problem in the state we don't
 
06:31:29.810 --> 06:31:29.820 align:start position:0%
have a problem in the state but when
 
06:31:31.730 --> 06:31:31.740 align:start position:0%
bills like this come up it makes people
 
06:31:34.070 --> 06:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
afraid so they're not willing to do the
 
06:31:35.270 --> 06:31:35.280 align:start position:0%
things that they've done in the other
 
06:31:38.090 --> 06:31:38.100 align:start position:0%
four 49 states which is things like
 
06:31:40.730 --> 06:31:40.740 align:start position:0%
online voter registration and no excuse
 
06:31:42.830 --> 06:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots it's time for us to
 
06:31:45.650 --> 06:31:45.660 align:start position:0%
join the 24th Cent first century in New
 
06:31:47.690 --> 06:31:47.700 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and make it easier for our
 
06:31:50.690 --> 06:31:50.700 align:start position:0%
citizens to vote and lastly third is
 
06:31:52.670 --> 06:31:52.680 align:start position:0%
that this bill would disenfranchise
 
06:31:55.430 --> 06:31:55.440 align:start position:0%
thousands of New Hampshire voters now
 
06:31:57.708 --> 06:31:57.718 align:start position:0%
the attorney from the ACLU gave you some
 
06:32:01.070 --> 06:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
statistics from the uh off-year election
 
06:32:04.250 --> 06:32:04.260 align:start position:0%
in 2022 go back to an article in New
 
06:32:06.410 --> 06:32:06.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Business review and November
 
06:32:09.350 --> 06:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
7th of 2021 it's a quoting from Bill
 
06:32:11.930 --> 06:32:11.940 align:start position:0%
Gardner former Secretary of State he
 
06:32:14.510 --> 06:32:14.520 align:start position:0%
said I don't have one example to give
 
06:32:16.970 --> 06:32:16.980 align:start position:0%
you where a person won an election in
 
06:32:19.548 --> 06:32:19.558 align:start position:0%
this state who should not have won it he
 
06:32:21.110 --> 06:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
discussed Protections in the New
 
06:32:22.610 --> 06:32:22.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law allowing people to
 
06:32:24.350 --> 06:32:24.360 align:start position:0%
register to vote on the day of an
 
06:32:26.628 --> 06:32:26.638 align:start position:0%
election those who don't have the proper
 
06:32:28.610 --> 06:32:28.620 align:start position:0%
documents to prove residency and other
 
06:32:31.310 --> 06:32:31.320 align:start position:0%
qualifications can sign an affidavit and
 
06:32:33.230 --> 06:32:33.240 align:start position:0%
the state follows up with a verification
 
06:32:35.628 --> 06:32:35.638 align:start position:0%
process through the mail about 4
 
06:32:37.970 --> 06:32:37.980 align:start position:0%
thousand voters had to sign such an
 
06:32:40.010 --> 06:32:40.020 align:start position:0%
affidavit in the state's primary and
 
06:32:42.890 --> 06:32:42.900 align:start position:0%
general elections in 2020 of those the
 
06:32:44.628 --> 06:32:44.638 align:start position:0%
state has not been able to authenticate
 
06:32:46.610 --> 06:32:46.620 align:start position:0%
the voter qualifications for about 600
 
06:32:48.530 --> 06:32:48.540 align:start position:0%
people although they were continuing to
 
06:32:50.090 --> 06:32:50.100 align:start position:0%
work upon it that's out of eight hundred
 
06:32:52.670 --> 06:32:52.680 align:start position:0%
thousand votes so Bill Gardner said
 
06:32:55.190 --> 06:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
never an election in the state has voter
 
06:32:57.948 --> 06:32:57.958 align:start position:0%
fraud changed an election four thousand
 
06:33:00.830 --> 06:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
people would be disenfranchised by this
 
06:33:00.840 --> 06:33:02.270 align:start position:0%
people would be disenfranchised by this
bill

06:33:02.270 --> 06:33:02.280 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:33:05.270 --> 06:33:05.280 align:start position:0%
the testimony from Louise Spencer was
 
06:33:07.430 --> 06:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
that the Heritage Foundation has looked
 
06:33:09.890 --> 06:33:09.900 align:start position:0%
at almost 20 years of Elections and has
 
06:33:12.350 --> 06:33:12.360 align:start position:0%
found 20 cases of voter fraud in New
 
06:33:15.350 --> 06:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that's one per election so are
 
06:33:17.390 --> 06:33:17.400 align:start position:0%
you willing and we don't really know the
 
06:33:19.548 --> 06:33:19.558 align:start position:0%
extent of that but one per election are
 
06:33:22.910 --> 06:33:22.920 align:start position:0%
you willing to disenfranchise 4
 
06:33:25.670 --> 06:33:25.680 align:start position:0%
000 residents of our state because there
 
06:33:28.610 --> 06:33:28.620 align:start position:0%
may be one case of voter fraud that
 
06:33:29.930 --> 06:33:29.940 align:start position:0%
really doesn't seem like a very good
 
06:33:32.270 --> 06:33:32.280 align:start position:0%
trade-off because voting is how people
 
06:33:34.910 --> 06:33:34.920 align:start position:0%
choose all of you who come here and
 
06:33:36.948 --> 06:33:36.958 align:start position:0%
debate about policies regarding
 
06:33:39.350 --> 06:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
education and health care and gun
