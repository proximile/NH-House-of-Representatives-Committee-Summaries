so if somebody wanted to file it I mean
 

00:13:32.959 --> 00:13:34.030 align:start position:0%
so if somebody wanted to file it I mean
we<00:13:33.040><c> could</c><00:13:33.160><c> hear</c><00:13:33.320><c> it</c><00:13:33.440><c> out</c><00:13:33.600><c> and</c><00:13:33.680><c> I</c><00:13:33.760><c> think</c><00:13:33.880><c> each</c>

00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:34.040 align:start position:0%
we could hear it out and I think each

00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:35.480 align:start position:0%
one of those like depending on what it
 

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:37.230 align:start position:0%
one of those like depending on what it

00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:37.240 align:start position:0%
is perhaps it has Merit like I don't
 

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:38.670 align:start position:0%
is perhaps it has Merit like I don't

can't I think after the first couple of
 

00:13:40.519 --> 00:13:41.470 align:start position:0%
can't I think after the first couple of

00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:41.480 align:start position:0%
these where it's like well we can't
 

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:43.189 align:start position:0%
these where it's like well we can't
really<00:13:41.800><c> do</c><00:13:42.040><c> anything</c><00:13:42.720><c> we're</c><00:13:42.880><c> just</c><00:13:43.000><c> going</c><00:13:43.120><c> to</c>

00:13:43.189 --> 00:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
really do anything we're just going to
 

00:13:43.199 --> 00:13:45.870 align:start position:0%
really do anything we're just going to
do<00:13:43.320><c> an</c><00:13:43.440><c> information</c><00:13:43.959><c> gathering</c><00:13:44.440><c> thing</c><00:13:45.440><c> right</c>

00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:45.880 align:start position:0%
do an information gathering thing right
 

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:48.350 align:start position:0%
do an information gathering thing right
go<00:13:46.040><c> from</c><00:13:46.279><c> there</c><00:13:46.440><c> and</c><00:13:46.600><c> hope</c><00:13:46.839><c> the</c><00:13:47.040><c> TS</c><00:13:47.760><c> pick</c><00:13:47.959><c> it</c><00:13:48.040><c> up</c>

00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:48.360 align:start position:0%
go from there and hope the TS pick it up
 

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:50.150 align:start position:0%
go from there and hope the TS pick it up
yeah<00:13:48.720><c> so</c><00:13:48.880><c> I</c><00:13:49.000><c> think</c><00:13:49.399><c> after</c><00:13:49.600><c> the</c><00:13:49.720><c> results</c><00:13:50.040><c> of</c>
