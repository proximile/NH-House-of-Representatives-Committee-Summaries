00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:58.830 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:44.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:47.159 align:start position:0%
do I'm gonna open the uh work session
 
00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 align:start position:0%
1485 good all right want me do that yeah
 
00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:54.879 align:start position:0%
oh yeah you got a much better knock than
 
00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
me yeah I used to break
 
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 align:start position:0%
po back in the old days
 
00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 align:start position:0%
so this was an act establishing a study
 
00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:04.519 align:start position:0%
committee for the totality of
 
00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 align:start position:0%
circumstances surrounding the covid-19
 
00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.030 align:start position:0%
circumstances surrounding the covid-19
pandemic

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 align:start position:0%
um I I get it right here if anybody
 
00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 align:start position:0%
wants to read it it's it's pretty simple
 
00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 align:start position:0%
right want set up a commission y my
 
00:03:18.149 --> 00:03:18.159 align:start position:0%
understanding yeah three members of the
 
00:03:20.589 --> 00:03:20.599 align:start position:0%
House appointed by the the the speaker
 
00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:21.799 align:start position:0%
one by the Senate by the president of
 
00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 align:start position:0%
the Senate one appointed by the governor
 
00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:25.599 align:start position:0%
the idea here is that uh from uh
 
00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
speaking with the bill uh Prime sponsor
 
00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 align:start position:0%
he mentioned that we already have a a
 
00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:31.599 align:start position:0%
there is an somewhat of an existing
 
00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 align:start position:0%
version of this that's covering kind of
 
00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519 align:start position:0%
how the state of New Hampshire handled
 
00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:36.599 align:start position:0%
it the idea for buying this bill was to
 
00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 align:start position:0%
see how the um like interactions between
 
00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:39.799 align:start position:0%
the federal governments and like
 
00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 align:start position:0%
non-governmental organizations whatever
 
00:03:43.149 --> 00:03:43.159 align:start position:0%
whether they be pharmaceutical
 
00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 align:start position:0%
Industries or International
 
00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 align:start position:0%
organizations like the World Health
 
00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 align:start position:0%
Organization and uh un Etc like may have
 
00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 align:start position:0%
had influence over policy decisions made
 
00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 align:start position:0%
here at the state level and how they may
 
00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:55.879 align:start position:0%
have filtered down to the schools Etc um
 
00:03:58.869 --> 00:03:58.879 align:start position:0%
there's a whole list of things yep that
 
00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
they wanted to protect potentially cover
 
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 align:start position:0%
here like and it's like covering
 
00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 align:start position:0%
everything from like operation War speed
 
00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 align:start position:0%
whether that was handled censorship
 
00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 align:start position:0%
efforts that were done by big Tech
 
00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 align:start position:0%
during the time um that we saw from like
 
00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 align:start position:0%
Twitter files things like that coming
 
00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 align:start position:0%
out uh especially the federal government
 
00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 align:start position:0%
putting the their thumb on the scales uh
 
00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 align:start position:0%
the FBI in particular um as with like I
 
00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 align:start position:0%
think a lot of these study committees I
 
00:04:21.749 --> 00:04:21.759 align:start position:0%
don't know how much we can glean from
 
00:04:23.189 --> 00:04:23.199 align:start position:0%
like the federal level like how like
 
00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 align:start position:0%
we're not going to be able it's another
 
00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 align:start position:0%
study committee it's another study
 
00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 align:start position:0%
committee um we' got a ton of those
 
00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 align:start position:0%
right um
 
00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 align:start position:0%
what's what's the breakdown the
 
00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 align:start position:0%
breakdown is three from the house one
 
00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 align:start position:0%
from the Senate one from the governor um
 
00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
it's not as broad like I know when we
 
00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 align:start position:0%
get to the um the this one has to be
 
00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 align:start position:0%
amended when we get to the uh the
 
00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 align:start position:0%
Liberty Bill like that one was like a
 
00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919 align:start position:0%
gigantic commission with all kinds of
 
00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 align:start position:0%
international individuals this is
 
00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:48.479 align:start position:0%
straightforward this is something that I
 
00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 align:start position:0%
think we can handle uh I don't know how
 
00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 align:start position:0%
much information we're going to be able
 
00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
to gain from like uh you know asking the
 
00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 align:start position:0%
federal government hey did you guys
 
00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 align:start position:0%
censor things and whether or not they'll
 
00:04:59.710 --> 00:04:59.720 align:start position:0%
be honest with us but uh it would be we
 
00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:01.479 align:start position:0%
could of course ask like uh you know
 
00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.720 align:start position:0%
hospitals like whether there was a
 
00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 align:start position:0%
coercion from the feds with Medicare
 
00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 align:start position:0%
funding or any other kind of funding
 
00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
whether it be in the schools like for
 
00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:12.280 align:start position:0%
compliance persuasion yeah of course
 
00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:13.880 align:start position:0%
yeah persuasion from the federal
 
00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600 align:start position:0%
government or other
 
00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 align:start position:0%
bill so I I'm inclined to uh recommend
 
00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:26.600 align:start position:0%
for further study uh I don't see any
 
00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:28.280 align:start position:0%
harm stud for legislation for the
 
00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:30.919 align:start position:0%
legislation for yeah exactly I have no
 
00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:36.039 align:start position:0%
problem with that inine you incline mhm
 
00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:38.720 align:start position:0%
so vote yeah we we could vote as a
 
00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.080 align:start position:0%
subcommittee like uh yeah do you want to
 
00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:44.560 align:start position:0%
call the role I guess sure thank you
 
00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 align:start position:0%
okay so you're making recommendation for
 
00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:49.199 align:start position:0%
further reg legisl future legislation
 
00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:50.830 align:start position:0%
further reg legisl future legislation
yeah

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:50.840 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:55.360 align:start position:0%
yeah I think it'll be for you okay I
 
00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
sub committee voted unanimously to
 
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
recommend further
 
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.160 align:start position:0%

you want to knock we'll close the work
 
00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
session on 1485 and we'll open the work
 
00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:40.680 align:start position:0%
session on uh HB 1041 this is the uh
 
00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:42.280 align:start position:0%
relative to establishing a commission to
 
00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:44.240 align:start position:0%
investigate the USS Liberty incident and
 
00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.390 align:start position:0%
investigate the USS Liberty incident and
its

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:45.400 align:start position:0%
its
 
00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:49.960 align:start position:0%
aftermath um so uh I have spoken to like
 
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
some of the activists with this and the
 
00:06:53.189 --> 00:06:53.199 align:start position:0%
Bill's Prime sponsor and uh I remember
 
00:06:55.309 --> 00:06:55.319 align:start position:0%
the representative shift did bring point
 
00:06:57.589 --> 00:06:57.599 align:start position:0%
out that some of the members of this the
 
00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
as written were problem IC we probably
 
00:07:02.309 --> 00:07:02.319 align:start position:0%
don't want like this International organ
 
00:07:03.869 --> 00:07:03.879 align:start position:0%
like some of these International
 
00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:06.080 align:start position:0%
organizations uh I have seen language
 
00:07:07.629 --> 00:07:07.639 align:start position:0%
that was floated to me after we already
 
00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:09.440 align:start position:0%
like interim studied this so like
 
00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:11.080 align:start position:0%
there's there's a path forward for this
 
00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
that I think requires uh scoping it down
 
00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:15.080 align:start position:0%
to something similar to just like 1485
 
00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:16.560 align:start position:0%
that we just did something that's like
 
00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:18.400 align:start position:0%
House and Senate and perhaps anybody
 
00:07:19.869 --> 00:07:19.879 align:start position:0%
else that wants to be involved whether
 
00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:21.680 align:start position:0%
it be like uh the American Legion or any
 
00:07:23.189 --> 00:07:23.199 align:start position:0%
of these other or veterans organizations
 
00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:25.360 align:start position:0%
in the state maybe somebody from esvac
 
00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:27.400 align:start position:0%
we can tap to come and be a member that
 
00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:29.000 align:start position:0%
that can represent the veteran Community
 
00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:30.240 align:start position:0%
as a whole
 
00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:31.560 align:start position:0%
uh but I mean that's up for the the
 
00:07:33.029 --> 00:07:33.039 align:start position:0%
whoever the bill writer is I I think
 
00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:36.280 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of Merit with this bill
 
00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:38.560 align:start position:0%
um I personally I believe that the
 
00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:40.560 align:start position:0%
federal government uh didn't do these
 
00:07:43.589 --> 00:07:43.599 align:start position:0%
men Justice uh the the entire
 
00:07:45.469 --> 00:07:45.479 align:start position:0%
investigation I think they said lasted
 
00:07:47.589 --> 00:07:47.599 align:start position:0%
like a week or so like there have been
 
00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:49.560 align:start position:0%
things like a stain on aess that took
 
00:07:50.869 --> 00:07:50.879 align:start position:0%
months and months and months of
 
00:07:52.749 --> 00:07:52.759 align:start position:0%
Investigation at the federal level and
 
00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:54.360 align:start position:0%
here we're talking about service members
 
00:07:56.909 --> 00:07:56.919 align:start position:0%
that were poent that were killed by a
 
00:07:58.469 --> 00:07:58.479 align:start position:0%
friendly fire incident got like less
 
00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
than a week of Investigation swept under
 
00:08:03.309 --> 00:08:03.319 align:start position:0%
the rug um I think that's a travesty and
 
00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:05.840 align:start position:0%
I feel like it you this happened in 1967
 
00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:07.120 align:start position:0%
these men aren't getting any younger and
 
00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:09.680 align:start position:0%
it' be great to bring these guys up
 
00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:12.440 align:start position:0%
before anything like my age level get
 
00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:14.560 align:start position:0%
them on the record get them tell their
 
00:08:16.309 --> 00:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
side of the story and we could try to
 
00:08:18.029 --> 00:08:18.039 align:start position:0%
get to the bottom as best we can as a
 
00:08:19.909 --> 00:08:19.919 align:start position:0%
state uh once again we're going to run
 
00:08:21.469 --> 00:08:21.479 align:start position:0%
into the same roadblocks trying to ask
 
00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
the federal government for to be for
 
00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:24.560 align:start position:0%
transparency or information that they
 
00:08:27.309 --> 00:08:27.319 align:start position:0%
have it'd be fantastic as you had
 
00:08:28.469 --> 00:08:28.479 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier that if we get like
 
00:08:30.149 --> 00:08:30.159 align:start position:0%
the our federal delegation to perhaps
 
00:08:35.149 --> 00:08:35.159 align:start position:0%
help us um in this I I don't you know I
 
00:08:37.149 --> 00:08:37.159 align:start position:0%
know that when this was filed there was
 
00:08:38.709 --> 00:08:38.719 align:start position:0%
there had just been attacks in Israel so
 
00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
there was like a some of this felt like
 
00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:43.880 align:start position:0%
uh bad timing but this is something this
 
00:08:45.949 --> 00:08:45.959 align:start position:0%
goes back this is from the 60s like this
 
00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
is an incident that happened a long time
 
00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:48.720 align:start position:0%
ago federal government looks the other
 
00:08:50.509 --> 00:08:50.519 align:start position:0%
way they feel like a lot of people
 
00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
believe this to be a settled issue but
 
00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:53.640 align:start position:0%
it's only because the federal government
 
00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
swept it under the rug and uh we got
 
00:08:57.190 --> 00:08:57.200 align:start position:0%
some kind of apology from Israel that
 
00:08:59.710 --> 00:08:59.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't justif that doesn't give osure
 
00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:01.360 align:start position:0%
to these men that experienced this then
 
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
were ultimately betrayed by the federal
 
00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:05.120 align:start position:0%
government when it came to getting
 
00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:07.560 align:start position:0%
Justice that they deserve or at least
 
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:09.760 align:start position:0%
acknowledgement a thorough investigation
 
00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:11.120 align:start position:0%
to find all the people potentially
 
00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:15.560 align:start position:0%
responsible for this a lot of suspicious
 
00:09:17.829 --> 00:09:17.839 align:start position:0%
consequences yep thank
 
00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:19.760 align:start position:0%
you do want to do the mic I don't know
 
00:09:22.949 --> 00:09:22.959 align:start position:0%
if this being broadcast I don't see the
 
00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:25.720 align:start position:0%
camer I don't know I guess I'm not sure
 
00:09:28.949 --> 00:09:28.959 align:start position:0%
they report any anyway all I know from
 
00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:36.509 --> 00:09:36.519 align:start position:0%
ship the Personnel on that ship the most
 
00:09:38.509 --> 00:09:38.519 align:start position:0%
decorated ship in the
 
00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:41.640 align:start position:0%
navor the Israelis paid Millions upon
 
00:09:44.509 --> 00:09:44.519 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars in
 
00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
reparation there were two Congressional
 
00:09:49.829 --> 00:09:49.839 align:start position:0%
Medal of Honor winners on that ship an
 
00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:51.880 align:start position:0%
unarmed ship that couldn't fight back
 
00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
why did they do that plenty of multiple
 
00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:55.949 align:start position:0%
why did they do that plenty of multiple
silver

00:09:55.949 --> 00:09:55.959 align:start position:0%
silver
 
00:09:59.069 --> 00:09:59.079 align:start position:0%
stars uh why was that done you trying to
 
00:09:59.910 --> 00:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
buy the
 
00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:02.440 align:start position:0%
silence I've been in the Navy I've been
 
00:10:04.509 --> 00:10:04.519 align:start position:0%
on ship but I was on a fighting ship a
 
00:10:06.949 --> 00:10:06.959 align:start position:0%
destroyer and we could at least fight
 
00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:11.240 align:start position:0%
back and supposedly Israel I'm pro
 
00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
Israel 100% however in my opinion what I
 
00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:17.000 align:start position:0%
see you don't
 
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.470 align:start position:0%
see you don't
strafe

00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:19.480 align:start position:0%
strafe
 
00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:23.240 align:start position:0%
um a friendly a friendly country to to
 
00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:25.640 align:start position:0%
you you don't Strife the the sailors
 
00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:27.200 align:start position:0%
that are on their lifeboats because the
 
00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:29.800 align:start position:0%
ship is sinking MH and you don't stra
 
00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:31.320 align:start position:0%
they went after the Japanese in World
 
00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
War II for doing just that yeah so uh I
 
00:10:38.949 --> 00:10:38.959 align:start position:0%
think this was egregious on the Israelis
 
00:10:43.269 --> 00:10:43.279 align:start position:0%
part but my thoughts were what gave them
 
00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:46.120 align:start position:0%
the idea that they could do that and get
 
00:10:48.829 --> 00:10:48.839 align:start position:0%
away with it do completely without any
 
00:10:51.829 --> 00:10:51.839 align:start position:0%
push back from a friendly nation which
 
00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
the United States was what was the
 
00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:56.360 align:start position:0%
Liberty doing it's a spice ship all you
 
00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:00.440 align:start position:0%
unarmed not one gun on the SP ship
 
00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:02.240 align:start position:0%
usually sometimes they have an escort
 
00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:04.360 align:start position:0%
but most of the time they go alone well
 
00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:06.360 align:start position:0%
what were they doing in the war zone to
 
00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
gather information for what and what was
 
00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
the excuse I know the size of a flag on
 
00:11:13.949 --> 00:11:13.959 align:start position:0%
a on a ship that's moving that that's
 
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
underway that the flag is very very
 
00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:20.560 align:start position:0%
visible from I was a signalman and they
 
00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:22.680 align:start position:0%
and even without binoculars from about
 
00:11:24.829 --> 00:11:24.839 align:start position:0%
maybe three miles away I could see that
 
00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
flag because it it was almost as big as
 
00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:30.440 align:start position:0%
this as as tables there a couple of
 
00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:33.160 align:start position:0%
these tables put together and you can we
 
00:11:35.269 --> 00:11:35.279 align:start position:0%
had to know how be able to identify
 
00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:38.360 align:start position:0%
which flag from which country yeah and
 
00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
so the
 
00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
Israelis I don't care how fast you're
 
00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:44.320 align:start position:0%
going in those Jets you see that flag
 
00:11:47.829 --> 00:11:47.839 align:start position:0%
yeah the PT boats see that flag clearly
 
00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:50.720 align:start position:0%
the testimony I see this guy right here
 
00:11:52.069 --> 00:11:52.079 align:start position:0%
there's no place to go where you going
 
00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:54.120 align:start position:0%
to hide you go to below deck you get
 
00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
steel shrap you're done or you take it
 
00:12:01.509 --> 00:12:01.519 align:start position:0%
you take my water so I'm f in favor of
 
00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
recommending this for further
 
00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:06.360 align:start position:0%
legislation with the recommendation that
 
00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
our uh Federal delegation gets involved
 
00:12:11.069 --> 00:12:11.079 align:start position:0%
in this they're the only ones that are
 
00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:13.320 align:start position:0%
going to have the clout to be able to to
 
00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
to maybe get any answers we won't we're
 
00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:17.000 align:start position:0%
just I'm just talking in the wind right
 
00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:18.880 align:start position:0%
now yeah we can have the men come and
 
00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
testify again get it on the record but
 
00:12:22.389 --> 00:12:22.399 align:start position:0%
that's like I think that's the limit of
 
00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:24.680 align:start position:0%
our abilities they may show up for the
 
00:12:27.269 --> 00:12:27.279 align:start position:0%
exec session yeah yep they may but but
 
00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:29.160 align:start position:0%
my recommendation if you need a
 
00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
recommendation from someone is that uh
 
00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:34.880 align:start position:0%
this is recommended
 
00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:38.320 align:start position:0%
for future
 
00:12:41.629 --> 00:12:41.639 align:start position:0%
legislation and and including uh a
 
00:12:44.829 --> 00:12:44.839 align:start position:0%
request that our federal delegation gets
 
00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:47.160 align:start position:0%
involved in this if they don't know
 
00:12:49.949 --> 00:12:49.959 align:start position:0%
about it now agree make it known to them
 
00:12:53.189 --> 00:12:53.199 align:start position:0%
I agree I agree with everything is said
 
00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:56.360 align:start position:0%
I was talking with someone and they said
 
00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
will this though open up committee to a
 
00:13:03.069 --> 00:13:03.079 align:start position:0%
lot of other things that happened that
 
00:13:05.509 --> 00:13:05.519 align:start position:0%
would we just way back when and will we
 
00:13:08.189 --> 00:13:08.199 align:start position:0%
be bombarded by it because of the fact
 
00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:12.800 align:start position:0%
that we did it for one now we expect
 
00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
to if it I would say I mean I could
 
00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:17.800 align:start position:0%
understand that
 
00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
the would you like anything that the US
 
00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
has potentially been involved in like
 
00:13:26.069 --> 00:13:26.079 align:start position:0%
elsewhere I mean uh and then it falls on
 
00:13:28.629 --> 00:13:28.639 align:start position:0%
the it'd be up to us to file it right
 
00:13:31.389 --> 00:13:31.399 align:start position:0%
like we like anybody could file anything
 
00:13:32.949 --> 00:13:32.959 align:start position:0%
so if somebody wanted to file it I mean
 
00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:34.040 align:start position:0%
we could hear it out and I think each
 
00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:35.480 align:start position:0%
one of those like depending on what it
 
00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:37.240 align:start position:0%
is perhaps it has Merit like I don't
 
00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:38.680 align:start position:0%
know like a lot of these things like we
 
00:13:40.509 --> 00:13:40.519 align:start position:0%
can't I think after the first couple of
 
00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:41.480 align:start position:0%
these where it's like well we can't
 
00:13:43.189 --> 00:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
really do anything we're just going to
 
00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:45.880 align:start position:0%
do an information gathering thing right
 
00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:48.360 align:start position:0%
go from there and hope the TS pick it up
 
00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:50.160 align:start position:0%
yeah so I think after the results of
 
00:13:51.749 --> 00:13:51.759 align:start position:0%
something like this they'll be like well
 
00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:53.680 align:start position:0%
you know we got it on record we did what
 
00:13:55.949 --> 00:13:55.959 align:start position:0%
we could do but it's not like we could
 
00:13:58.509 --> 00:13:58.519 align:start position:0%
we we as a state cannot necessarily hold
 
00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
a form country you know responsible so
 
00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:02.560 align:start position:0%
like nothing's gonna happen so they can
 
00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
file future bills based off of the
 
00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
precedent of filing this one but I don't
 
00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
know what they may not see value in it
 
00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:11.680 align:start position:0%
um I don't I don't necessarily worry
 
00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:13.279 align:start position:0%
about it we can debate it here as this
 
00:14:14.749 --> 00:14:14.759 align:start position:0%
it'll probably come to us I have no
 
00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:16.120 align:start position:0%
problem debating anything that anybody
 
00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:18.440 align:start position:0%
wants to file something along those
 
00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
lines there may be Merit who knows yeah
 
00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:22.240 align:start position:0%
I just want to bring that forward
 
00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
because that was valid concern said
 
00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
especially if it's within the United
 
00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
States involving another country then
 
00:14:35.949 --> 00:14:35.959 align:start position:0%
are we will like right yeah my because I
 
00:14:37.829 --> 00:14:37.839 align:start position:0%
agree with what you said my only concern
 
00:14:40.749 --> 00:14:40.759 align:start position:0%
is is is yeah my concern is
 
00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:44.440 align:start position:0%
that keep thinking
 
00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:46.269 align:start position:0%
that keep thinking
that

00:14:46.269 --> 00:14:46.279 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:52.440 align:start position:0%
a an ally does not attack another Ally
 
00:14:55.509 --> 00:14:55.519 align:start position:0%
without no there no argument what was
 
00:14:58.310 --> 00:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
the reasoning behind it that's yeah
 
00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:00.680 align:start position:0%
sticking in my because these guys I'm 80
 
00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
years old so these guys are are probably
 
00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:05.920 align:start position:0%
in the late 70s and into their 80s some
 
00:15:09.069 --> 00:15:09.079 align:start position:0%
of them are barely walking right so I I
 
00:15:11.829 --> 00:15:11.839 align:start position:0%
can understand what and I was on a
 
00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
warship you could fight back these guys
 
00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:16.440 align:start position:0%
couldn't fight back there's the flag hey
 
00:15:19.269 --> 00:15:19.279 align:start position:0%
this's a star of David there're our
 
00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:22.040 align:start position:0%
allies right yeah and I'm getting shot
 
00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:24.120 align:start position:0%
at there's nothing I can do about this
 
00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:26.160 align:start position:0%
this would almost make a very good Ken
 
00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:28.720 align:start position:0%
Burns type document and that would get
 
00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
it to the public so much better who
 
00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:33.800 align:start position:0%
knows Ken than a committee you know
 
00:15:37.949 --> 00:15:37.959 align:start position:0%
report yeah that's it's true because
 
00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:39.560 align:start position:0%
it's you know a lot of things like that
 
00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
out there what struck me at a very
 
00:15:45.269 --> 00:15:45.279 align:start position:0%
emotional level was the v's coming and
 
00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:48.160 align:start position:0%
testifying to us and I didn't want to
 
00:15:50.309 --> 00:15:50.319 align:start position:0%
give them false hope about what we could
 
00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:53.240 align:start position:0%
do to change their situation yes that
 
00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:55.120 align:start position:0%
that has to I think be very clear like
 
00:15:56.269 --> 00:15:56.279 align:start position:0%
there's not much we can do we can't
 
00:15:58.150 --> 00:15:58.160 align:start position:0%
necessarily hold anybody blow off
 
00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:00.120 align:start position:0%
exactly yeah
 
00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:01.880 align:start position:0%
uh I keep looking at this picture and
 
00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:03.560 align:start position:0%
I'm haunted I I got about three hours
 
00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
sleep last night because I knew we were
 
00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
going to appear today and I know what
 
00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:11.000 align:start position:0%
it's like there's no place to go no
 
00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
place to hide I was on a on the signal
 
00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:15.240 align:start position:0%
bridge above the Pilot House on the
 
00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:18.680 align:start position:0%
Destroyer my the used to the the bean
 
00:16:21.269 --> 00:16:21.279 align:start position:0%
counters would say that my you know in
 
00:16:24.509 --> 00:16:24.519 align:start position:0%
the gunfight in know right in a battle
 
00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:27.160 align:start position:0%
my survivability rate would be like 35
 
00:16:30.309 --> 00:16:30.319 align:start position:0%
seconds y you know but when you're 20
 
00:16:31.749 --> 00:16:31.759 align:start position:0%
years old you're going to live forever
 
00:16:34.189 --> 00:16:34.199 align:start position:0%
yeah right doesn't get you until it hits
 
00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:37.880 align:start position:0%
you until it gets you so is there any
 
00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:40.720 align:start position:0%
federal committee or whatever that
 
00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
grievances like this can be brought to
 
00:16:47.189 --> 00:16:47.199 align:start position:0%
them or do they not have anything like
 
00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:48.680 align:start position:0%
they have a
 
00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:51.240 align:start position:0%
federal I'm not armed services committee
 
00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:52.440 align:start position:0%
there is an armed services committee I
 
00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
don't know it would probably be this and
 
00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:56.680 align:start position:0%
like through the VA like you'd have to
 
00:16:58.269 --> 00:16:58.279 align:start position:0%
probably like work with the Veterans
 
00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:00.160 align:start position:0%
Administration to see what what they
 
00:17:01.629 --> 00:17:01.639 align:start position:0%
could do like but it would have to be
 
00:17:02.629 --> 00:17:02.639 align:start position:0%
something similar to like what we're
 
00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
doing here theyd probably have to form
 
00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:06.520 align:start position:0%
something specific about this incident I
 
00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:08.640 align:start position:0%
was just wondering Ted should have
 
00:17:11.110 --> 00:17:11.120 align:start position:0%
something that we could say okay we're
 
00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:14.480 align:start position:0%
recommending this um for you know future
 
00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:17.160 align:start position:0%
legislation but that it can move on to
 
00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:19.480 align:start position:0%
the next step which would be yeah
 
00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:22.520 align:start position:0%
whatever I mean as opposed to getting to
 
00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:24.669 align:start position:0%
whatever I mean as opposed to getting to
a

00:17:24.669 --> 00:17:24.679 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:27.280 align:start position:0%
wall well there's uh standards of
 
00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:34.280 align:start position:0%
they each have grievances reviews you
 
00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:37.280 align:start position:0%
know boards but is that more about like
 
00:17:41.789 --> 00:17:41.799 align:start position:0%
interm militaries yeah it is to
 
00:17:46.669 --> 00:17:46.679 align:start position:0%
me if I really wanted to make change now
 
00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:49.000 align:start position:0%
I would talk to someone like a Ken Burns
 
00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
and say listen these people are still
 
00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
alive get their story while they're here
 
00:17:55.909 --> 00:17:55.919 align:start position:0%
because I will tell you I I couldn't
 
00:17:58.070 --> 00:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
leave my seat listening to what they had
 
00:17:59.870 --> 00:17:59.880 align:start position:0%
to say oh I know and I was close to
 
00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:02.120 align:start position:0%
tears I actually was close to tears they
 
00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:06.360 align:start position:0%
are the best Advocates that exist yeah
 
00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:08.440 align:start position:0%
and telling their story is the best way
 
00:18:11.470 --> 00:18:11.480 align:start position:0%
to get people to understand and demand
 
00:18:15.149 --> 00:18:15.159 align:start position:0%
change it's good idea we'll work on that
 
00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:17.320 align:start position:0%
yeah I know I'm looking at I'm looking
 
00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
at the review boards like I just don't
 
00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:21.480 align:start position:0%
think this is going to go
 
00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
anywhere the one thing about so them
 
00:18:25.789 --> 00:18:25.799 align:start position:0%
coming before us like raise their
 
00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:28.120 align:start position:0%
profile and perhaps like if if we do go
 
00:18:29.669 --> 00:18:29.679 align:start position:0%
ahead with the legislation on this in
 
00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:31.280 align:start position:0%
the future that would also raise the
 
00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:32.520 align:start position:0%
profile it's things like that you have
 
00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:33.960 align:start position:0%
to just keep mentioning it so it doesn't
 
00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:36.520 align:start position:0%
disappear put it yeah right put a bird
 
00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:37.400 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:39.320 align:start position:0%
saddle of the
 
00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:42.760 align:start position:0%
federal those responsible I'm I'm sure
 
00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:44.230 align:start position:0%
federal those responsible I'm I'm sure
that

00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:44.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:18:47.149 --> 00:18:47.159 align:start position:0%
that the ones who made the
 
00:18:47.159 --> 00:18:48.830 align:start position:0%
that the ones who made the
decisions

00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:51.240 align:start position:0%
to squash
 
00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
this most of them are dead now oh oh
 
00:18:59.750 --> 00:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
yeah we're talking 67 yeah you know the
 
00:19:01.549 --> 00:19:01.559 align:start position:0%
guys who were Admiral back then were in
 
00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:04.240 align:start position:0%
their 50s and 60s yeah they're not I
 
00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:06.240 align:start position:0%
think they're gone so right so anybody
 
00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
who's trying tose we have to stir the
 
00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:11.480 align:start position:0%
ashes yeah but this this this is the one
 
00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:12.510 align:start position:0%
ashes yeah but this this this is the one
that

00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:12.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:19:14.950 --> 00:19:14.960 align:start position:0%
really the report from the
 
00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:19.240 align:start position:0%
ja where the time was a a full bird
 
00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
Captain where
 
00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:25.280 align:start position:0%
is this guy right here yeah David
 
00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:27.640 align:start position:0%
Lewis and all this information they want
 
00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:29.240 align:start position:0%
to give him like days
 
00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:32.720 align:start position:0%
to put something together M and then
 
00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:34.600 align:start position:0%
when they were ready to
 
00:19:40.029 --> 00:19:40.039 align:start position:0%
go to the uh what do they call that an
 
00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
inquiry an inquiry na inquiry that uh
 
00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:46.480 align:start position:0%
they were told by the one who was the
 
00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
Admiral the four star who was in
 
00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:51.480 align:start position:0%
responsible for that theater of
 
00:19:54.669 --> 00:19:54.679 align:start position:0%
operations at six or seven I think uh
 
00:19:57.669 --> 00:19:57.679 align:start position:0%
told me squash it but we have this this
 
00:19:59.950 --> 00:19:59.960 align:start position:0%
this information you do
 
00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:05.080 align:start position:0%
not it's horrible you do not yeah and he
 
00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:06.600 align:start position:0%
he didn't make that decision on his own
 
00:20:10.909 --> 00:20:10.919 align:start position:0%
no a fourstar takes his orders from guys
 
00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:14.280 align:start position:0%
in suits y
 
00:20:17.549 --> 00:20:17.559 align:start position:0%
yeah so that's uh that's my two sets oh
 
00:20:17.559 --> 00:20:18.470 align:start position:0%
yeah so that's uh that's my two sets oh
that's

00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:18.480 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
good I mean I so I would like to make a
 
00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
motion to recommend for future
 
00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
legislation you need yeah I'm not sure
 
00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:35.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
unanimous this yes
 
00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:46.840 align:start position:0%
yeah because I assume when we meet again
 
00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
after veto day we're going to just go
 
00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:52.360 align:start position:0%

00:21:11.549 --> 00:21:11.559 align:start position:0%
yeah the year before I was like in that
 
00:21:11.559 --> 00:21:14.110 align:start position:0%
yeah the year before I was like in that
neighborhood

00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:14.120 align:start position:0%
neighborhood
 
00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:17.320 align:start position:0%

00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
right now could you read back what the
 
00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:32.510 align:start position:0%
right now could you read back what the
the

00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:36.320 align:start position:0%
official um what we're recommending so
 
00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:38.200 align:start position:0%
Manion makes a motion to recommend for
 
00:21:40.789 --> 00:21:40.799 align:start position:0%
further future legislation but up here
 
00:21:42.029 --> 00:21:42.039 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:21:45.029 --> 00:21:45.039 align:start position:0%
discussion um we talked about the
 
00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
inadequate investigation back in
 
00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
1967 statement of concerned getting
 
00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
information from the federal government
 
00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:53.400 align:start position:0%
and felt our federal delegation should
 
00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:56.320 align:start position:0%
request a proper investigation beautiful
 
00:21:58.029 --> 00:21:58.039 align:start position:0%
okay if he can get a hold of somebody if
 
00:21:58.039 --> 00:21:59.430 align:start position:0%
okay if he can get a hold of somebody if
can

00:21:59.430 --> 00:21:59.440 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
get a hold of some of these people
 
00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:04.440 align:start position:0%
survivors oh yeah and get a hold of the
 
00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
uh the survivors of the Dead this guy is
 
00:22:12.549 --> 00:22:12.559 align:start position:0%
dead but I'm sure there the family
 
00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:14.520 align:start position:0%
probably has all kinds of notes and
 
00:22:16.669 --> 00:22:16.679 align:start position:0%
archives yeah that I think that would
 
00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:18.520 align:start position:0%
make I would I would definitely watch
 
00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:20.600 align:start position:0%
that yeah and for future if we do the
 
00:22:22.149 --> 00:22:22.159 align:start position:0%
they refile this amend it like one of
 
00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:24.760 align:start position:0%
the uh guidelines of the the committee
 
00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:26.360 align:start position:0%
could be whatever report we generate is
 
00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:28.200 align:start position:0%
sent to the federal delegation yeah we
 
00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:29.400 align:start position:0%
could do that that could be written in
 
00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:31.960 align:start position:0%
the in the future Bill all right so I
 
00:22:34.269 --> 00:22:34.279 align:start position:0%
guess with that we can uh close the the
 
00:22:35.669 --> 00:22:35.679 align:start position:0%
work session on
 
00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:38.760 align:start position:0%
10:41 youate a motion to adjourn uh
 
00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:41.400 align:start position:0%
motion to adjourn so moved all right
 
00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:42.720 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you thank you guys for
 
00:22:57.430 --> 00:22:57.440 align:start position:0%
