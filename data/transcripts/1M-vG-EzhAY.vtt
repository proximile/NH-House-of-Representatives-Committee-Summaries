00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.110 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:41.879 align:start position:0%
being 10 o'clock Apple time
 
00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 align:start position:0%
we will open the
 
00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 align:start position:0%
budget work session for the community
 
00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
colleges when we welcome Chancellor
 
00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:52.379 align:start position:0%
Rubenstein and director Reed
 
00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 align:start position:0%
good morning and thank you for having us
 
00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 align:start position:0%
back I assume this is the opportunity
 
00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 align:start position:0%
now that the governor's budget is out
 
00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 align:start position:0%
for us to get into a little bit more
 
00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 align:start position:0%
detail uh once again you have a
 
00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 align:start position:0%
presentation in front of you and this
 
00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:14.099 align:start position:0%
time I'm going to try and do a little
 
00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 align:start position:0%
bit better job of staying with script
 
00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 align:start position:0%
but we'll certainly be here more to
 
00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
answer questions that the committee has
 
00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 align:start position:0%
so appreciate your time this morning
 
00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 align:start position:0%
as a second slide illustrates our
 
00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 align:start position:0%
service to the state as Educators is a
 
00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 align:start position:0%
Statewide mission
 
00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:34.979 align:start position:0%
campuses placed in regions throughout
 
00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 align:start position:0%
93 percent of our students are New
 
00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:40.979 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents and the information
 
00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 align:start position:0%
we have suggests that most of them work
 
00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
and persist after graduation in the
 
00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 align:start position:0%
communities where they live so the the
 
00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 align:start position:0%
education they receive continues to
 
00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:53.759 align:start position:0%
resonate for New Hampshire
 
00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 align:start position:0%
our programs include our dual enrollment
 
00:04:59.749 --> 00:04:59.759 align:start position:0%
in high schools more than 100 high
 
00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 align:start position:0%
schools participate in running start but
 
00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 align:start position:0%
we also have Early College Programs we
 
00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:07.199 align:start position:0%
host a couple of charter school programs
 
00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:09.419 align:start position:0%
on our campuses
 
00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 align:start position:0%
our core work is reflected in associate
 
00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 align:start position:0%
degree and certificate programs the
 
00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:16.380 align:start position:0%
associate degrees being in some cases
 
00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020 align:start position:0%
career focused and Automotive for
 
00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:21.320 align:start position:0%
instance and Welding in other cases
 
00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:24.419 align:start position:0%
leading to transfer Pathways University
 
00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:27.320 align:start position:0%
system and other four-year institutions
 
00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 align:start position:0%
and then we also increasingly have been
 
00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:32.039 align:start position:0%
doing more with career focus training
 
00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:34.520 align:start position:0%
not what's currently non-credit
 
00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 align:start position:0%
programming intended to help people
 
00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 align:start position:0%
already in the workforce or entering the
 
00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:42.539 align:start position:0%
workforce shorter time frame more more
 
00:05:44.749 --> 00:05:44.759 align:start position:0%
immediate access and impact for their
 
00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 align:start position:0%
personal circumstances and for their
 
00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.749 align:start position:0%
personal circumstances and for their
employers

00:05:50.749 --> 00:05:50.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:53.460 align:start position:0%
when we put together our budget request
 
00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.120 align:start position:0%
for the governor we had a core set of
 
00:05:59.930 --> 00:05:59.940 align:start position:0%
priorities one has to do with our
 
00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:02.580 align:start position:0%
long-term mission of supporting access
 
00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:04.380 align:start position:0%
to post-secondary education through
 
00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:07.380 align:start position:0%
affordability uh reflected in the
 
00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:10.320 align:start position:0%
programs that we do in high schools but
 
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
also the pathways to the community
 
00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
college system and then through the
 
00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:15.780 align:start position:0%
community college system to the
 
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:17.940 align:start position:0%
university system and beyond
 
00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:19.919 align:start position:0%
we're continuing to focus on
 
00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:22.380 align:start position:0%
strengthening New Hampshire's Workforce
 
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
and increasingly want to find ways that
 
00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:27.479 align:start position:0%
our physical resources our campuses
 
00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:30.380 align:start position:0%
across the state can serve as uh
 
00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:32.940 align:start position:0%
resources for their communities beyond
 
00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:43.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:46.860 align:start position:0%
the following slide it's page four is
 
00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:49.620 align:start position:0%
our current appropriation the three
 
00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
percent efficiency and the specific in
 
00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
the fiscal 23 budget the specific
 
00:06:58.249 --> 00:06:58.259 align:start position:0%
scholarship support for dual enrollment
 
00:06:59.749 --> 00:06:59.759 align:start position:0%
concurrent enrollment courses
 
00:07:01.909 --> 00:07:01.919 align:start position:0%
specifically scholarships for stem and
 
00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:04.020 align:start position:0%
CTE courses
 
00:07:06.409 --> 00:07:06.419 align:start position:0%
building on that we made some very
 
00:07:08.749 --> 00:07:08.759 align:start position:0%
particular requests of the governor
 
00:07:11.689 --> 00:07:11.699 align:start position:0%
we asked that the state allow us to
 
00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:14.220 align:start position:0%
continue to freeze tuition we've kept
 
00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
tuition virtually flat for the last 12
 
00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:20.220 align:start position:0%
years it was 210 dollars a credit in
 
00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:24.180 align:start position:0%
2011. it's 215 dollars a credit today
 
00:07:27.469 --> 00:07:27.479 align:start position:0%
and our goal was to keep that flat in
 
00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:30.080 align:start position:0%
part because we're allowing uh
 
00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
affordability to catch up with us if you
 
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:33.969 align:start position:0%
affordability to catch up with us if you
will

00:07:33.969 --> 00:07:33.979 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:36.660 align:start position:0%
we're in a position now where the value
 
00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:39.360 align:start position:0%
of federal Pell Grant now exceeds the
 
00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:41.460 align:start position:0%
cost of full-time enrollment for a New
 
00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:43.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire resident in the coming year
 
00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:45.300 align:start position:0%
that's a threshold that wouldn't have
 
00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:48.300 align:start position:0%
been true 10 years ago or five years ago
 
00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
and if we had simply allowed tuition to
 
00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:52.380 align:start position:0%
increase over time with the rate of
 
00:07:55.189 --> 00:07:55.199 align:start position:0%
inflation it still wouldn't be true so
 
00:07:57.890 --> 00:07:57.900 align:start position:0%
the combination of State support and and
 
00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:00.300 align:start position:0%
fiscal discipline we've we've reached an
 
00:08:02.629 --> 00:08:02.639 align:start position:0%
important milestone for the state
 
00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:06.120 align:start position:0%
we asked specifically for support for
 
00:08:08.089 --> 00:08:08.099 align:start position:0%
Workforce programs these are typically
 
00:08:10.249 --> 00:08:10.259 align:start position:0%
short-term programs not currently
 
00:08:13.249 --> 00:08:13.259 align:start position:0%
eligible for federal financial aid
 
00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:15.900 align:start position:0%
over the last several years there have
 
00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:18.180 align:start position:0%
been competing bills in Congress the U.S
 
00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
Congress that have not gotten through
 
00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:23.160 align:start position:0%
the jobs act and more recently uh
 
00:08:25.129 --> 00:08:25.139 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation with the acronym
 
00:08:28.129 --> 00:08:28.139 align:start position:0%
Pell intended to support lifelong
 
00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:30.780 align:start position:0%
learning either of those would help
 
00:08:33.529 --> 00:08:33.539 align:start position:0%
address this issue which is creating Aid
 
00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
to support short-term programs with a
 
00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:39.180 align:start position:0%
work for Workforce Focus but in the
 
00:08:41.089 --> 00:08:41.099 align:start position:0%
absence of that kind of support for a
 
00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:43.740 align:start position:0%
lot of Learners this is what they need
 
00:08:47.509 --> 00:08:47.519 align:start position:0%
not a semester not a credit based not a
 
00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
degree based learning opportunity maybe
 
00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
it's a certificate in lean Six Sigma
 
00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:56.100 align:start position:0%
maybe it's a CDL program but on a
 
00:08:59.030 --> 00:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
different calendar than a semester-based
 
00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:00.420 align:start position:0%
program like the one we have at White
 
00:09:02.269 --> 00:09:02.279 align:start position:0%
Mountains Community College
 
00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:05.160 align:start position:0%
so that was a second request
 
00:09:08.389 --> 00:09:08.399 align:start position:0%
we asked for support to expand access to
 
00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:10.440 align:start position:0%
our early childhood education programs
 
00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
because we think we're in a position to
 
00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:14.820 align:start position:0%
make a contribution to the state's need
 
00:09:17.449 --> 00:09:17.459 align:start position:0%
for more high quality accessible
 
00:09:20.269 --> 00:09:20.279 align:start position:0%
affordable child care and we think that
 
00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:22.380 align:start position:0%
this would contribute to expanding the
 
00:09:24.769 --> 00:09:24.779 align:start position:0%
pathway in the pipeline increase the
 
00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:27.540 align:start position:0%
availability of affordable child care in
 
00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
we ask for support for the Dual and
 
00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:33.480 align:start position:0%
concurrent enrollment program as I
 
00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:35.220 align:start position:0%
described earlier currently it's a
 
00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:36.720 align:start position:0%
million and a half in scholarship
 
00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:39.060 align:start position:0%
support and it's specifically stem and
 
00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:41.700 align:start position:0%
CTE courses we wanted to expand that to
 
00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:44.580 align:start position:0%
up to five courses a year and Beyond
 
00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:47.880 align:start position:0%
just stem and CTE courses and as I
 
00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:49.620 align:start position:0%
described when I was here last time in
 
00:09:52.009 --> 00:09:52.019 align:start position:0%
some ways dual enrollment is our primary
 
00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:54.240 align:start position:0%
contribution to affordability for middle
 
00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:55.800 align:start position:0%
class families who are not going to be
 
00:09:57.290 --> 00:09:57.300 align:start position:0%
eligible for federal grants for
 
00:09:59.570 --> 00:09:59.580 align:start position:0%
post-secondary but if we can assist them
 
00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:02.100 align:start position:0%
in more more affordable access to
 
00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
completing a path to college while still
 
00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:07.380 align:start position:0%
in high school we can help manage the
 
00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
the longer term costs help them avoid
 
00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:10.670 align:start position:0%
the longer term costs help them avoid
debt

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:10.680 align:start position:0%
debt
 
00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
we did ask for sufficient funds at the
 
00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
time what we thought would be required
 
00:10:17.509 --> 00:10:17.519 align:start position:0%
to bring a promise program effectively
 
00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:20.220 align:start position:0%
covering the cost of community college
 
00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:24.080 align:start position:0%
for students who had high need
 
00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:26.820 align:start position:0%
we've subsequently refined the estimate
 
00:10:29.509 --> 00:10:29.519 align:start position:0%
of what that would take and then we'd
 
00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:32.160 align:start position:0%
ask for some support for Energy
 
00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:34.440 align:start position:0%
Efficiency projects as I mentioned we've
 
00:10:36.769 --> 00:10:36.779 align:start position:0%
got campuses across the state a growing
 
00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
part of our expense has been utilities
 
00:10:41.449 --> 00:10:41.459 align:start position:0%
and thinking long term trying to
 
00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:44.640 align:start position:0%
mitigate those costs with renewable
 
00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:49.250 align:start position:0%
mitigate those costs with renewable
alternatives

00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:49.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:52.740 align:start position:0%
so with the governor's budget first let
 
00:10:56.389 --> 00:10:56.399 align:start position:0%
me say we're grateful that was um we
 
00:10:58.970 --> 00:10:58.980 align:start position:0%
appreciate the support in addition to
 
00:11:02.329 --> 00:11:02.339 align:start position:0%
the the foundation of three percent from
 
00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:04.980 align:start position:0%
the efficiency budget support sufficient
 
00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
to allow us to keep tuition Frozen for
 
00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:10.260 align:start position:0%
the biennium and specific investment in
 
00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:12.720 align:start position:0%
that early childhood education we we
 
00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:15.240 align:start position:0%
greatly appreciated although I don't
 
00:11:17.329 --> 00:11:17.339 align:start position:0%
know that we've seen it my understanding
 
00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:20.480 align:start position:0%
is House Bill 2 also has an increased
 
00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:22.680 align:start position:0%
additional half a million dollars to
 
00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:24.240 align:start position:0%
support dual and concurrent enrollment
 
00:11:26.389 --> 00:11:26.399 align:start position:0%
and give us a little bit more latitude
 
00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:28.680 align:start position:0%
because part of what we currently have
 
00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:30.540 align:start position:0%
is scholarships to continue to deliver
 
00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:33.300 align:start position:0%
running start in high schools in some
 
00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
schools they may not have the teachers
 
00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
who are academically qualified to
 
00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:38.640 align:start position:0%
deliver parts of the curriculum for us
 
00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:41.100 align:start position:0%
to have more ability to be creative in
 
00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:43.200 align:start position:0%
deploying our faculty to support that
 
00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:45.660 align:start position:0%
instruction can expand opportunities for
 
00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:48.180 align:start position:0%
students beyond the scholarship
 
00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:49.130 align:start position:0%
students beyond the scholarship
um

00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:49.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:52.069 --> 00:11:52.079 align:start position:0%
we'd also ask for and in the language we
 
00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:54.600 align:start position:0%
understand uh Board of Trustees would
 
00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
have authority to address the
 
00:11:59.870 --> 00:11:59.880 align:start position:0%
participation of future employees not
 
00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:01.980 align:start position:0%
current and not currently employed and
 
00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
eligible but future employees not
 
00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:06.300 align:start position:0%
otherwise eligible to participate in the
 
00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:09.240 align:start position:0%
state Employee Retirement System this is
 
00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:11.940 align:start position:0%
a long-term uh issue for managing
 
00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:14.640 align:start position:0%
expense when the universe community
 
00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:16.500 align:start position:0%
college system became an independent
 
00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:20.220 align:start position:0%
entity in 2007 property transferred to
 
00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:22.680 align:start position:0%
the Board of Trustees in 2011 but no
 
00:12:25.069 --> 00:12:25.079 align:start position:0%
change was made in participation in the
 
00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:27.240 align:start position:0%
state Employee Retirement System we
 
00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
currently have some employees in a
 
00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
separate 403 b plan majority of our
 
00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:34.620 align:start position:0%
employees are still in the state
 
00:12:36.829 --> 00:12:36.839 align:start position:0%
Employee Retirement System and it's an
 
00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:39.300 align:start position:0%
area where expense continues to grow and
 
00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:41.220 align:start position:0%
over which the board has no Authority so
 
00:12:42.829 --> 00:12:42.839 align:start position:0%
we had requested the board have that
 
00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:45.720 align:start position:0%
authority to make a decision not to make
 
00:12:47.509 --> 00:12:47.519 align:start position:0%
the decision but the authority when they
 
00:12:49.069 --> 00:12:49.079 align:start position:0%
made the when the time came that they
 
00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:54.050 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:54.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:56.329 --> 00:12:56.339 align:start position:0%
as you can see at the bottom of Slide
 
00:12:56.339 --> 00:12:57.190 align:start position:0%
as you can see at the bottom of Slide
Five

00:12:57.190 --> 00:12:57.200 align:start position:0%
Five
 
00:12:59.870 --> 00:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
several of the items that we requested
 
00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
were not part of the funding from the
 
00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
governor's budget and certainly
 
00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:05.220 align:start position:0%
understand competing pressures and
 
00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:07.730 align:start position:0%
understand competing pressures and
priorities

00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:07.740 align:start position:0%
priorities
 
00:13:09.769 --> 00:13:09.779 align:start position:0%
among those and and perhaps really
 
00:13:11.889 --> 00:13:11.899 align:start position:0%
absent from them
 
00:13:16.009 --> 00:13:16.019 align:start position:0%
we were a little bit surprised and to
 
00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:18.300 align:start position:0%
see no Capital funding for the community
 
00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
college system in the next biennium
 
00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
proposed we weren't necessarily looking
 
00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:25.340 align:start position:0%
proposed we weren't necessarily looking
for

00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:25.350 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:26.930 align:start position:0%
for
[Music]

00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:26.940 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
on slide six we weren't necessarily
 
00:13:33.829 --> 00:13:33.839 align:start position:0%
looking for uh new buildings but we have
 
00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:36.120 align:start position:0%
appreciated the support we've had for
 
00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
critical maintenance needs for I.T in
 
00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
particular in recent years and and so
 
00:13:44.509 --> 00:13:44.519 align:start position:0%
had anticipated there'd be some coverage
 
00:13:46.069 --> 00:13:46.079 align:start position:0%
for that
 
00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
among the things that we had
 
00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
specifically asked for and for which
 
00:13:52.129 --> 00:13:52.139 align:start position:0%
funding wasn't allocated we still
 
00:13:55.069 --> 00:13:55.079 align:start position:0%
believe that absent Federal funding in
 
00:13:58.129 --> 00:13:58.139 align:start position:0%
either the jobs act or the Pell Bill in
 
00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:01.200 align:start position:0%
Congress that funding for Workforce
 
00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:03.420 align:start position:0%
programs will help particularly working
 
00:14:07.069 --> 00:14:07.079 align:start position:0%
adults looking to upskill for different
 
00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:09.660 align:start position:0%
Industries or change careers into
 
00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:11.220 align:start position:0%
different industries that are vital to
 
00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:15.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:17.389 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:14:17.389 --> 00:14:17.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:19.740 align:start position:0%
just some notes
 
00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:20.329 align:start position:0%
just some notes
um

00:14:20.329 --> 00:14:20.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:22.500 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned earlier about the
 
00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:24.420 align:start position:0%
affordability part of that has been the
 
00:14:26.509 --> 00:14:26.519 align:start position:0%
state's continued support for our work
 
00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:28.440 align:start position:0%
part of it has been our efforts to
 
00:14:30.889 --> 00:14:30.899 align:start position:0%
manage our own expenses
 
00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:32.820 align:start position:0%
we've reduced our Workforce by 30
 
00:14:35.269 --> 00:14:35.279 align:start position:0%
percent primarily by attrition as
 
00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:37.380 align:start position:0%
attrition has occurred reorganizing how
 
00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
we do that work to be able to maintain
 
00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:42.120 align:start position:0%
services and deliver our programs in a
 
00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:44.100 align:start position:0%
more efficient way
 
00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:46.680 align:start position:0%
we continue to look at ways to identify
 
00:14:48.949 --> 00:14:48.959 align:start position:0%
services that can be centralized we're
 
00:14:50.569 --> 00:14:50.579 align:start position:0%
currently working on some of that with
 
00:14:50.579 --> 00:14:52.189 align:start position:0%
currently working on some of that with
it

00:14:52.189 --> 00:14:52.199 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:54.660 align:start position:0%
looking at shared positions Regional
 
00:14:57.470 --> 00:14:57.480 align:start position:0%
positions within the system again just
 
00:14:59.810 --> 00:14:59.820 align:start position:0%
capitalizing on the efficiency and the
 
00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
talent that we have to deploy more
 
00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:05.689 align:start position:0%
talent that we have to deploy more
effectively

00:15:05.689 --> 00:15:05.699 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:08.389 --> 00:15:08.399 align:start position:0%
one other note about our programs I
 
00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:10.680 align:start position:0%
think I touched upon this in in previous
 
00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:12.170 align:start position:0%
think I touched upon this in in previous
discussion

00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:12.180 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:14.940 align:start position:0%
as our portfolio of academic programs
 
00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:16.860 align:start position:0%
has shifted one of the things that's
 
00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:20.100 align:start position:0%
most clear is that the place where we
 
00:15:22.189 --> 00:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
continue to have a critical role are
 
00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:24.120 align:start position:0%
programs that are
 
00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
in healthcare whether it's nursing
 
00:15:29.829 --> 00:15:29.839 align:start position:0%
dental hygiene
 
00:15:32.949 --> 00:15:32.959 align:start position:0%
welding automotive technology
 
00:15:35.329 --> 00:15:35.339 align:start position:0%
engineering technologies that do not
 
00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
have Alternatives within the state those
 
00:15:39.769 --> 00:15:39.779 align:start position:0%
programs also tend to be some of the
 
00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:42.360 align:start position:0%
most expensive that we deliver and as
 
00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:43.800 align:start position:0%
our enrollments are increasingly
 
00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
concentrated in that area
 
00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:49.320 align:start position:0%
it's it becomes one of the balance
 
00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:51.300 align:start position:0%
points as we try and maintain
 
00:15:53.569 --> 00:15:53.579 align:start position:0%
affordability but ensure the quality of
 
00:15:55.850 --> 00:15:55.860 align:start position:0%
those programs and although we're not
 
00:15:57.889 --> 00:15:57.899 align:start position:0%
making a specific ask it's simply
 
00:15:59.629 --> 00:15:59.639 align:start position:0%
helpful I think for you to understand
 
00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:02.100 align:start position:0%
that that's part of the dynamic that we
 
00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
we work with to sustain programs that
 
00:16:07.269 --> 00:16:07.279 align:start position:0%
are significantly more costly to deliver
 
00:16:10.189 --> 00:16:10.199 align:start position:0%
that that simply don't have Alternatives
 
00:16:12.829 --> 00:16:12.839 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
00:16:12.839 --> 00:16:14.710 align:start position:0%
in the state
foreign

00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:14.720 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:16:17.689 --> 00:16:17.699 align:start position:0%
happy to stop if questions have come up
 
00:16:20.569 --> 00:16:20.579 align:start position:0%
but we've reached a familiar slide this
 
00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:22.680 align:start position:0%
is reinforcing the point that I made had
 
00:16:25.129 --> 00:16:25.139 align:start position:0%
we simply allowed tuition to rise at the
 
00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
rate of consumer inflation not even
 
00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
higher education inflation which is
 
00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:31.560 align:start position:0%
notoriously more fast-paced than
 
00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:33.480 align:start position:0%
consumer inflation but it at the
 
00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
consumer rate uh tuition would be close
 
00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
to 280 a credit
 
00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:40.380 align:start position:0%
we've kept it virtually flat for 12
 
00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:43.800 align:start position:0%
years that that increases the buying
 
00:16:47.689 --> 00:16:47.699 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:47.699 --> 00:16:54.530 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:54.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:57.710 --> 00:16:57.720 align:start position:0%
to the extent that it's helpful on slide
 
00:17:00.069 --> 00:17:00.079 align:start position:0%
nine an overview of our
 
00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
revenue and allocation of our expenses
 
00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:06.240 align:start position:0%
these are both for fiscal 23.
 
00:17:08.689 --> 00:17:08.699 align:start position:0%
just for context the total figure on
 
00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
Revenue about 124 million total figure
 
00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:20.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
and I think at this point I'll stop and
 
00:17:25.789 --> 00:17:25.799 align:start position:0%
entertain any questions the committee
 
00:17:25.799 --> 00:17:30.169 align:start position:0%
entertain any questions the committee
has

00:17:30.169 --> 00:17:30.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chairman I I have
 
00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:36.480 align:start position:0%
two questions well first of all since
 
00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:38.220 align:start position:0%
you're talking about your revenues and
 
00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:39.529 align:start position:0%
you're talking about your revenues and
expenses

00:17:39.529 --> 00:17:39.539 align:start position:0%
expenses
 
00:17:39.539 --> 00:17:40.310 align:start position:0%
expenses
um

00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:44.029 --> 00:17:44.039 align:start position:0%
do you have a ballpark figure about what
 
00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:46.020 align:start position:0%
for the unmet needs
 
00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:48.480 align:start position:0%
to be added that would have to be added
 
00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:49.549 align:start position:0%
to be added that would have to be added
to

00:17:49.549 --> 00:17:49.559 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:51.780 align:start position:0%
what's in the in the governor's budget
 
00:17:55.010 --> 00:17:55.020 align:start position:0%
here yeah if if we were going to try and
 
00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
deliver a promise program for New
 
00:17:59.029 --> 00:17:59.039 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents who are Pell
 
00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
eligible those students from the federal
 
00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
government judges have be eligible for
 
00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
that Grant to pick up the balance of
 
00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
what they don't cover this would be for
 
00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:09.720 align:start position:0%
students who don't have a zero
 
00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:11.340 align:start position:0%
contribution but then something larger
 
00:18:13.669 --> 00:18:13.679 align:start position:0%
best estimate would be about three and a
 
00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:16.500 align:start position:0%
half million dollars so roughly half of
 
00:18:18.289 --> 00:18:18.299 align:start position:0%
what we had originally been looking at
 
00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:19.860 align:start position:0%
and part of that is that the value of
 
00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
the Pell Grant projected for next year
 
00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:24.600 align:start position:0%
has increased thank you
 
00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
um I follow up I want to thank you both
 
00:18:28.909 --> 00:18:28.919 align:start position:0%
for putting me in touch with President
 
00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
Lloyd and White Mountains Community
 
00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
College and and when I did speak with
 
00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:34.740 align:start position:0%
him last week he was just getting ready
 
00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:36.660 align:start position:0%
to make a presentation to the local
 
00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:40.140 align:start position:0%
school board instead of instead of
 
00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:42.780 align:start position:0%
um keeping the the North Conway office
 
00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:44.940 align:start position:0%
open they're going to close that and
 
00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:46.440 align:start position:0%
blend everything into the high school
 
00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:48.780 align:start position:0%
program can can you just give me any
 
00:18:51.169 --> 00:18:51.179 align:start position:0%
little more specifics on what will be
 
00:18:53.029 --> 00:18:53.039 align:start position:0%
included in the high school
 
00:18:55.789 --> 00:18:55.799 align:start position:0%
so I I I won't be able to go into
 
00:18:57.830 --> 00:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
complete depth on that one and I didn't
 
00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:01.080 align:start position:0%
mean to be uh vague when we last met but
 
00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
I knew that he president Lloyd wanted to
 
00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:04.980 align:start position:0%
have that conversation with his
 
00:19:06.669 --> 00:19:06.679 align:start position:0%
Community First
 
00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:10.440 align:start position:0%
current facility is a lease facility
 
00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:13.860 align:start position:0%
yeah and relatively low it uh activity
 
00:19:17.090 --> 00:19:17.100 align:start position:0%
So the plan I believe is primarily
 
00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:19.260 align:start position:0%
related to
 
00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:22.620 align:start position:0%
um biological sciences and they're going
 
00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:25.020 align:start position:0%
to partner with the high school to make
 
00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
the programs that much more accessible
 
00:19:29.029 --> 00:19:29.039 align:start position:0%
in the same way that we're looking for
 
00:19:31.549 --> 00:19:31.559 align:start position:0%
ways to make our campuses more engaged
 
00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:34.140 align:start position:0%
this is just turning the coin the other
 
00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
way and capitalizing on the relationship
 
00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:38.940 align:start position:0%
we have with the high school so
 
00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:41.460 align:start position:0%
most of the programs currently offered
 
00:19:43.549 --> 00:19:43.559 align:start position:0%
at that location in Conway will continue
 
00:19:46.669 --> 00:19:46.679 align:start position:0%
to be available but not all of them and
 
00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
part of that's a function of demand yes
 
00:19:51.049 --> 00:19:51.059 align:start position:0%
thank you it sounded like a sensible
 
00:19:54.650 --> 00:19:54.660 align:start position:0%
plan and and to um
 
00:19:58.370 --> 00:19:58.380 align:start position:0%
to have the to in order to have more
 
00:20:00.529 --> 00:20:00.539 align:start position:0%
people take advantage of it by putting
 
00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:02.940 align:start position:0%
it in high school instead of having to
 
00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:05.240 align:start position:0%
be a whole separate
 
00:20:09.529 --> 00:20:09.539 align:start position:0%
program we are trying to remove those
 
00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
kinds of barriers for students and to
 
00:20:13.789 --> 00:20:13.799 align:start position:0%
the extent that students are accustomed
 
00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
to learning in their High School
 
00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:17.700 align:start position:0%
environment and capitalize on that
 
00:20:20.210 --> 00:20:20.220 align:start position:0%
relationship we can we can do better and
 
00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:22.860 align:start position:0%
simply a better use of resources for us
 
00:20:24.770 --> 00:20:24.780 align:start position:0%
but also to put that facility that
 
00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
wasn't getting a lot of activity to
 
00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:28.980 align:start position:0%
better use for that community that least
 
00:20:32.029 --> 00:20:32.039 align:start position:0%
facility can probably serve some private
 
00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:33.480 align:start position:0%
business better than it was able to
 
00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:34.500 align:start position:0%
serve us
 
00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:36.240 align:start position:0%
thank you I appreciate that and that's
 
00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:38.460 align:start position:0%
that's really what what I was asking you
 
00:20:40.909 --> 00:20:40.919 align:start position:0%
last week but was it's long to how to
 
00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:43.200 align:start position:0%
get local people to take take advantage
 
00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:45.780 align:start position:0%
of the programs more more advantage of
 
00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:47.160 align:start position:0%
it than they were
 
00:20:52.669 --> 00:20:52.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:52.679 --> 00:20:53.330 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:53.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
when I look at the things that were not
 
00:20:59.029 --> 00:20:59.039 align:start position:0%
funded it seems to me that uh you've got
 
00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:01.100 align:start position:0%
apples and bananas going on here because
 
00:21:04.510 --> 00:21:04.520 align:start position:0%
uh Energy Efficiency or like one-time
 
00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:06.900 align:start position:0%
Investments but the trouble with the
 
00:21:09.289 --> 00:21:09.299 align:start position:0%
budget process is if that is a budget
 
00:21:12.289 --> 00:21:12.299 align:start position:0%
line then that becomes a budget budgeted
 
00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:14.220 align:start position:0%
item ah nausea you know I mean it
 
00:21:15.890 --> 00:21:15.900 align:start position:0%
doesn't it doesn't go away
 
00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:17.690 align:start position:0%
doesn't it doesn't go away
so

00:21:17.690 --> 00:21:17.700 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:20.520 align:start position:0%
I'm just observing I'm not criticizing
 
00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:23.460 align:start position:0%
yeah that that's entirely true um in his
 
00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
budget address the governor did note
 
00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:28.620 align:start position:0%
that he was using
 
00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
um the surplus funds to fund one-time
 
00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:34.260 align:start position:0%
projects and the energy improvement work
 
00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:35.940 align:start position:0%
that would be a one time that would not
 
00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:37.620 align:start position:0%
be in addition to base that would
 
00:21:41.029 --> 00:21:41.039 align:start position:0%
continue indefinitely similarly on side
 
00:21:43.909 --> 00:21:43.919 align:start position:0%
six we outline a most significant unmet
 
00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:45.960 align:start position:0%
need in the Capital Area and the
 
00:21:47.690 --> 00:21:47.700 align:start position:0%
governor had also indicated that he used
 
00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:50.280 align:start position:0%
in his budget formulation he used some
 
00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:52.380 align:start position:0%
Surplus dollars to fund those kind of
 
00:21:55.490 --> 00:21:55.500 align:start position:0%
one-time capital projects we have not
 
00:21:57.830 --> 00:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
seen House Bill 2 to know what
 
00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
specifically is funded that way in it
 
00:22:04.810 --> 00:22:04.820 align:start position:0%
with fy23 surplus funds but we are
 
00:22:07.669 --> 00:22:07.679 align:start position:0%
hoping that that the committee may see
 
00:22:10.010 --> 00:22:10.020 align:start position:0%
some room there to make adjustments to
 
00:22:12.409 --> 00:22:12.419 align:start position:0%
help us meet these Capital needs
 
00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:13.860 align:start position:0%
particularly for critical maintenance
 
00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:17.640 align:start position:0%
and I.T infrastructure upgrades which
 
00:22:19.549 --> 00:22:19.559 align:start position:0%
again would not go to base those would
 
00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
be one time
 
00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
runs for FY 24 and 25
 
00:22:25.490 --> 00:22:25.500 align:start position:0%
but it would seem that you could also
 
00:22:29.930 --> 00:22:29.940 align:start position:0%
use one-time funds for buying equipment
 
00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
that lasts more than five years or you
 
00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:34.010 align:start position:0%
that lasts more than five years or you
know

00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:34.020 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:35.580 align:start position:0%
I'm just saying it's going to push the
 
00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:41.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:45.649 --> 00:22:45.659 align:start position:0%
right I I think we're we're trying we're
 
00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
trying to be respectful of the process
 
00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
and not overreach even our request for
 
00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:52.980 align:start position:0%
the promise program that eight million
 
00:22:56.090 --> 00:22:56.100 align:start position:0%
dollars which was uh our best estimate
 
00:22:59.210 --> 00:22:59.220 align:start position:0%
at the time we felt a little bit of of
 
00:23:01.850 --> 00:23:01.860 align:start position:0%
angst about that so I think we're just
 
00:23:03.409 --> 00:23:03.419 align:start position:0%
trying to be respectful of competing
 
00:23:03.419 --> 00:23:04.549 align:start position:0%
trying to be respectful of competing
priorities

00:23:04.549 --> 00:23:04.559 align:start position:0%
priorities
 
00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:06.480 align:start position:0%
so what would your total one-time
 
00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:18.240 align:start position:0%
our Capital request had been had been
 
00:23:19.669 --> 00:23:19.679 align:start position:0%
quite High
 
00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
um initially we had outlined almost 20
 
00:23:23.210 --> 00:23:23.220 align:start position:0%
million dollars worth of capital
 
00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
projects and and none of that was
 
00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:26.270 align:start position:0%
projects and and none of that was
included

00:23:26.270 --> 00:23:26.280 align:start position:0%
included
 
00:23:29.810 --> 00:23:29.820 align:start position:0%
we have been reassessing what our kind
 
00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
of most most critical priorities are in
 
00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
the capital realm and it's frankly it's
 
00:23:35.149 --> 00:23:35.159 align:start position:0%
critical maintenance of our facilities
 
00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
we have seven colleges across the state
 
00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:39.200 align:start position:0%
many of them were built in the 1960s
 
00:23:42.289 --> 00:23:42.299 align:start position:0%
these require just ongoing kind of
 
00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
attention and specific projects like
 
00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:47.580 align:start position:0%
um rooftop units and boilers and roofs
 
00:23:50.409 --> 00:23:50.419 align:start position:0%
and some energy efficient
 
00:23:53.450 --> 00:23:53.460 align:start position:0%
upgrades such as Windows as outlined on
 
00:23:55.549 --> 00:23:55.559 align:start position:0%
slide six we have kind of trimmed that
 
00:23:57.850 --> 00:23:57.860 align:start position:0%
to a six million dollar
 
00:24:00.529 --> 00:24:00.539 align:start position:0%
The Six Million Dollar ask for that work
 
00:24:01.970 --> 00:24:01.980 align:start position:0%
you can see that in the first bullet
 
00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:05.330 align:start position:0%
you can see that in the first bullet
point

00:24:05.330 --> 00:24:05.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:08.149 --> 00:24:08.159 align:start position:0%
is that per year or for by any of that
 
00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:13.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:16.669 --> 00:24:16.679 align:start position:0%
question wouldn't the Solar projects for
 
00:24:19.210 --> 00:24:19.220 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency fall in the same uh
 
00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
category that chairman Emerick was
 
00:24:24.529 --> 00:24:24.539 align:start position:0%
asking about yes they would so now we
 
00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:26.700 align:start position:0%
are looking at you know 15-6 for the
 
00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:28.200 align:start position:0%
critical maintenance and the nine
 
00:24:30.169 --> 00:24:30.179 align:start position:0%
requested for efficiency
 
00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
yes the six for critical maintenance is
 
00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:33.590 align:start position:0%
yes the six for critical maintenance is
really

00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
um critical And Timely right the the
 
00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
Solar projects are something that we
 
00:24:40.669 --> 00:24:40.679 align:start position:0%
would we would we would really love to
 
00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
be able to do
 
00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:44.460 align:start position:0%
um because that it would help not just
 
00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:46.020 align:start position:0%
our campuses
 
00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
um address utility costs but it would it
 
00:24:51.169 --> 00:24:51.179 align:start position:0%
would have broader effects on on energy
 
00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:53.580 align:start position:0%
use in our in our regions right if we
 
00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
were to if we were able to mount solar
 
00:24:56.149 --> 00:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
arrays that could generate a lot of
 
00:24:58.250 --> 00:24:58.260 align:start position:0%
energy then that would reduce demand for
 
00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:00.120 align:start position:0%
other types of energy generation quick
 
00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:01.450 align:start position:0%
other types of energy generation quick
follow-up

00:25:01.450 --> 00:25:01.460 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:04.260 align:start position:0%
do you have an estimate of the you know
 
00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
savings that you will achieve by
 
00:25:07.850 --> 00:25:07.860 align:start position:0%
investing the 9 million in solar energy
 
00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:09.720 align:start position:0%
obviously it's hard to predict
 
00:25:12.169 --> 00:25:12.179 align:start position:0%
electricity prices I I'll grant you that
 
00:25:13.909 --> 00:25:13.919 align:start position:0%
but and we cannot assume that at the
 
00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:16.620 align:start position:0%
current levels but do you have you know
 
00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:19.020 align:start position:0%
uh expectation that your operational
 
00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
costs will be reduced by a certain
 
00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:28.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:31.020 align:start position:0%
sorry Scott Fields Chief Operating
 
00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
Officer we've estimated with the new
 
00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:34.980 align:start position:0%
energy contract that we've just signed
 
00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:37.260 align:start position:0%
if we could do the solar array we would
 
00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
produce roughly 50 to 60 percent of our
 
00:25:41.330 --> 00:25:41.340 align:start position:0%
energy consumption
 
00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:43.740 align:start position:0%
utility bills planned for this year over
 
00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:45.480 align:start position:0%
three million dollars so over time that
 
00:25:48.529 --> 00:25:48.539 align:start position:0%
would pay off in 45 years so if I
 
00:25:50.029 --> 00:25:50.039 align:start position:0%
understand correctly or saying about
 
00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:52.740 align:start position:0%
half of your bill would be cut so we are
 
00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
looking at one to one point five million
 
00:25:57.289 --> 00:25:57.299 align:start position:0%
at the current rates which again change
 
00:25:59.750 --> 00:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
well we've locked into a contract for
 
00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:01.260 align:start position:0%
the current rate so that would be right
 
00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:03.000 align:start position:0%
and fairly static what's the life
 
00:26:05.210 --> 00:26:05.220 align:start position:0%
expectation of the solar panels I'm
 
00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:07.320 align:start position:0%
sorry what's the life expectancy of the
 
00:26:09.769 --> 00:26:09.779 align:start position:0%
solar panels we did preliminary research
 
00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
and it was
 
00:26:13.669 --> 00:26:13.679 align:start position:0%
I have to go back and double check but
 
00:26:15.370 --> 00:26:15.380 align:start position:0%
it's at least 15.
 
00:26:19.909 --> 00:26:19.919 align:start position:0%
and one last clarification
 
00:26:21.769 --> 00:26:21.779 align:start position:0%
um actually I lost my train of thought I
 
00:26:21.779 --> 00:26:24.669 align:start position:0%
um actually I lost my train of thought I
yield

00:26:24.669 --> 00:26:24.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:28.370 --> 00:26:28.380 align:start position:0%
thank you is this for all campuses or
 
00:26:37.610 --> 00:26:37.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
um just a concern of mine
 
00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:40.370 align:start position:0%
um just a concern of mine
um

00:26:40.370 --> 00:26:40.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:42.769 --> 00:26:42.779 align:start position:0%
enrollment you have a number of
 
00:26:44.930 --> 00:26:44.940 align:start position:0%
facilities they
 
00:26:48.049 --> 00:26:48.059 align:start position:0%
used to full capacity
 
00:26:49.970 --> 00:26:49.980 align:start position:0%
um is there I think what you're doing in
 
00:26:52.549 --> 00:26:52.559 align:start position:0%
Conway is a great idea
 
00:26:55.010 --> 00:26:55.020 align:start position:0%
um I hate to see a lot of money invested
 
00:26:58.190 --> 00:26:58.200 align:start position:0%
in facilities that might end up on a for
 
00:26:58.200 --> 00:26:59.210 align:start position:0%
in facilities that might end up on a for
sale

00:26:59.210 --> 00:26:59.220 align:start position:0%
sale
 
00:27:02.810 --> 00:27:02.820 align:start position:0%
at some future date so where are you in
 
00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:07.260 align:start position:0%
terms of your enrollment and how
 
00:27:10.190 --> 00:27:10.200 align:start position:0%
based on that what are the real needs in
 
00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
terms of your actual structures
 
00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:16.440 align:start position:0%
so you're correct the long-term trend
 
00:27:18.529 --> 00:27:18.539 align:start position:0%
for physical enrollment in our campuses
 
00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:20.700 align:start position:0%
has been down part of what we're looking
 
00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:23.340 align:start position:0%
at is how do we make our campuses more
 
00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
accessible for other purposes
 
00:27:28.549 --> 00:27:28.559 align:start position:0%
find Partners whose work is compatible
 
00:27:30.409 --> 00:27:30.419 align:start position:0%
with ours and that will bring more value
 
00:27:32.510 --> 00:27:32.520 align:start position:0%
and more activity more activity of the
 
00:27:34.909 --> 00:27:34.919 align:start position:0%
camps more value to the community as an
 
00:27:36.890 --> 00:27:36.900 align:start position:0%
example in Littleton another part of
 
00:27:38.269 --> 00:27:38.279 align:start position:0%
White Mountains Community College
 
00:27:40.789 --> 00:27:40.799 align:start position:0%
there's a Head Start program and a New
 
00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire employment security office on
 
00:27:45.769 --> 00:27:45.779 align:start position:0%
that campus we're looking for similar
 
00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
Partnerships that bring value to the
 
00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:50.700 align:start position:0%
state and to the communities that we
 
00:27:53.630 --> 00:27:53.640 align:start position:0%
serve by co-locating those kinds of
 
00:27:58.070 --> 00:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
offices so we don't Envision giving up
 
00:28:00.409 --> 00:28:00.419 align:start position:0%
the campuses we have we're trying to
 
00:28:03.049 --> 00:28:03.059 align:start position:0%
revitalize them to make them more useful
 
00:28:08.149 --> 00:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
more more impactful in those ways if I
 
00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
could just add um in our original
 
00:28:12.110 --> 00:28:12.120 align:start position:0%
capital request which we developed
 
00:28:14.210 --> 00:28:14.220 align:start position:0%
almost a year ago the timetable of the
 
00:28:15.769 --> 00:28:15.779 align:start position:0%
state capital budget process goes back
 
00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:18.120 align:start position:0%
that far we had some requests in there
 
00:28:20.330 --> 00:28:20.340 align:start position:0%
that was that related to specific
 
00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:23.880 align:start position:0%
buildings and um Renovations those are
 
00:28:26.390 --> 00:28:26.400 align:start position:0%
not in what you see before you today in
 
00:28:28.850 --> 00:28:28.860 align:start position:0%
part for that very reason we are in a
 
00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:30.720 align:start position:0%
process of kind of reimagining how we're
 
00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:33.000 align:start position:0%
going to be using our space given
 
00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:35.940 align:start position:0%
um a greater shift to online education
 
00:28:37.549 --> 00:28:37.559 align:start position:0%
given you know a number of different
 
00:28:40.549 --> 00:28:40.559 align:start position:0%
factors so we're not attempting to kind
 
00:28:42.769 --> 00:28:42.779 align:start position:0%
of bring those those projects forward
 
00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
right now what we're focusing on right
 
00:28:46.909 --> 00:28:46.919 align:start position:0%
now are keeping our buildings
 
00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
basically sound
 
00:28:53.390 --> 00:28:53.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:57.470 align:start position:0%
 
Joe

00:28:57.470 --> 00:28:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:59.690 --> 00:28:59.700 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman oh thank you for
 
00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:02.760 align:start position:0%
being here again uh one question I asked
 
00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:04.380 align:start position:0%
a dumb question what's Esso New
 
00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:05.330 align:start position:0%
a dumb question what's Esso New
Hampshire

00:29:05.330 --> 00:29:05.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:29:08.029 --> 00:29:08.039 align:start position:0%
or s-o-n-h
 
00:29:11.090 --> 00:29:11.100 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry that's that's probably too
 
00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:14.090 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry that's that's probably too
obvious

00:29:14.090 --> 00:29:14.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:16.669 --> 00:29:16.679 align:start position:0%
um yeah uh you got some other questions
 
00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
too is there any uh talk of combining
 
00:29:23.570 --> 00:29:23.580 align:start position:0%
CTE with uh Community call system
 
00:29:25.730 --> 00:29:25.740 align:start position:0%
because we're I mean we're heading in
 
00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:27.720 align:start position:0%
that direction but uh that that would
 
00:29:30.169 --> 00:29:30.179 align:start position:0%
seem to be an all logical move because
 
00:29:32.389 --> 00:29:32.399 align:start position:0%
like like welding once you know welding
 
00:29:36.049 --> 00:29:36.059 align:start position:0%
even in high school it'll you know it it
 
00:29:37.789 --> 00:29:37.799 align:start position:0%
goes right into the community call
 
00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:39.480 align:start position:0%
system I mean you once once you know how
 
00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:41.460 align:start position:0%
to weld you know how to weld well I know
 
00:29:43.250 --> 00:29:43.260 align:start position:0%
commissioner edelblue has talked about
 
00:29:45.769 --> 00:29:45.779 align:start position:0%
some potential joint facilities in the
 
00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:47.880 align:start position:0%
future that would would be an efficient
 
00:29:50.149 --> 00:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
use of resources and recently we've
 
00:29:53.690 --> 00:29:53.700 align:start position:0%
spoken and on behalf of nhti have spoken
 
00:29:55.310 --> 00:29:55.320 align:start position:0%
with the Concord Regional Technical
 
00:29:57.289 --> 00:29:57.299 align:start position:0%
Center about the possibility of
 
00:29:59.690 --> 00:29:59.700 align:start position:0%
co-location and collaboration around
 
00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:02.520 align:start position:0%
specifically their program so the
 
00:30:04.610 --> 00:30:04.620 align:start position:0%
opportunities are there and some of that
 
00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:06.720 align:start position:0%
is already happening I expect we'll see
 
00:30:08.510 --> 00:30:08.520 align:start position:0%
more of it over time
 
00:30:11.090 --> 00:30:11.100 align:start position:0%
like uh follow-up
 
00:30:14.029 --> 00:30:14.039 align:start position:0%
um capital reserve funds in in this
 
00:30:15.889 --> 00:30:15.899 align:start position:0%
school districts we use capital reserve
 
00:30:18.049 --> 00:30:18.059 align:start position:0%
funds because you don't replace a roof
 
00:30:20.269 --> 00:30:20.279 align:start position:0%
every year I mean you're going to have
 
00:30:22.370 --> 00:30:22.380 align:start position:0%
several roofs in the in the future can
 
00:30:24.590 --> 00:30:24.600 align:start position:0%
you use Capital do we have a system in
 
00:30:25.730 --> 00:30:25.740 align:start position:0%
the state to
 
00:30:28.430 --> 00:30:28.440 align:start position:0%
you know put money away for for those uh
 
00:30:29.930 --> 00:30:29.940 align:start position:0%
timely uh
 
00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:31.370 align:start position:0%
timely uh
endeavors

00:30:31.370 --> 00:30:31.380 align:start position:0%
endeavors
 
00:30:36.409 --> 00:30:36.419 align:start position:0%
but we we we do have reserves yes
 
00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:39.480 align:start position:0%
um specific to Capital
 
00:30:42.350 --> 00:30:42.360 align:start position:0%
Capital Reserves
 
00:30:45.470 --> 00:30:45.480 align:start position:0%
or general reserves General reserves are
 
00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:50.570 --> 00:30:50.580 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:30:53.690 --> 00:30:53.700 align:start position:0%
everything so it's not earmarked as
 
00:30:56.090 --> 00:30:56.100 align:start position:0%
capital reserves it's it's a broader
 
00:30:56.100 --> 00:31:00.289 align:start position:0%
capital reserves it's it's a broader
bucket

00:31:00.289 --> 00:31:00.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:02.930 --> 00:31:02.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so I remembered
 
00:31:05.029 --> 00:31:05.039 align:start position:0%
what my last question on the electricity
 
00:31:07.669 --> 00:31:07.679 align:start position:0%
was how what's the duration of the fixed
 
00:31:10.730 --> 00:31:10.740 align:start position:0%
rate contract you're currently in
 
00:31:13.010 --> 00:31:13.020 align:start position:0%
five years I'll repeat the answer so we
 
00:31:16.010 --> 00:31:16.020 align:start position:0%
don't have to move people around and I
 
00:31:16.970 --> 00:31:16.980 align:start position:0%
would really appreciate it I don't know
 
00:31:19.430 --> 00:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
if I missed that I'm looking on slide
 
00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
four in the bottom table there is a
 
00:31:23.630 --> 00:31:23.640 align:start position:0%
freeze tuition for the next two years
 
00:31:26.029 --> 00:31:26.039 align:start position:0%
and the tuition reset to bring down the
 
00:31:28.370 --> 00:31:28.380 align:start position:0%
cost of Education I understand the free
 
00:31:30.169 --> 00:31:30.179 align:start position:0%
situation but I'm not sure I understand
 
00:31:33.049 --> 00:31:33.059 align:start position:0%
the tuition reset line
 
00:31:36.470 --> 00:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
so the the original proposal when we
 
00:31:38.450 --> 00:31:38.460 align:start position:0%
were trying to figure out how we could
 
00:31:40.789 --> 00:31:40.799 align:start position:0%
bring a promise program what's sometimes
 
00:31:43.490 --> 00:31:43.500 align:start position:0%
called that I got it thank you sorry the
 
00:31:45.169 --> 00:31:45.179 align:start position:0%
the wording didn't
 
00:31:51.470 --> 00:31:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:53.389 --> 00:31:53.399 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:31:55.430 --> 00:31:55.440 align:start position:0%
what what are the qualifications for
 
00:31:56.750 --> 00:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
someone that teaches in a community
 
00:31:59.149 --> 00:31:59.159 align:start position:0%
called system and you know like like a
 
00:32:01.490 --> 00:32:01.500 align:start position:0%
welder does he you have to have a degree
 
00:32:05.149 --> 00:32:05.159 align:start position:0%
or or just have the knowledge to uh to
 
00:32:08.029 --> 00:32:08.039 align:start position:0%
teach yeah typically there's a
 
00:32:10.909 --> 00:32:10.919 align:start position:0%
requirement for uh and pay on discipline
 
00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
to be a master's degree or above in the
 
00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:15.720 align:start position:0%
discipline in the case of specialized
 
00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:19.080 align:start position:0%
knowledge Automotive or welding it's
 
00:32:21.230 --> 00:32:21.240 align:start position:0%
going to be more industry certifications
 
00:32:24.590 --> 00:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
but also with experience teaching some
 
00:32:30.370 --> 00:32:30.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:32.570 --> 00:32:32.580 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
00:32:34.909 --> 00:32:34.919 align:start position:0%
as you know I did that for a living for
 
00:32:36.950 --> 00:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
about a decade in the it field you know
 
00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:39.240 align:start position:0%
it was exactly that process and for the
 
00:32:41.269 --> 00:32:41.279 align:start position:0%
record when I got hired some of the
 
00:32:43.669 --> 00:32:43.679 align:start position:0%
training centers universities actually
 
00:32:46.549 --> 00:32:46.559 align:start position:0%
ask you to you know present in front of
 
00:32:48.169 --> 00:32:48.179 align:start position:0%
their audience to determine whether you
 
00:32:49.850 --> 00:32:49.860 align:start position:0%
can teach not only whether you can
 
00:32:52.850 --> 00:32:52.860 align:start position:0%
Master the topic so while requirements
 
00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:54.360 align:start position:0%
may vary they are generally very
 
00:32:55.909 --> 00:32:55.919 align:start position:0%
effective in determining who's going to
 
00:32:57.590 --> 00:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
do a good job
 
00:32:59.029 --> 00:32:59.039 align:start position:0%
um so you know those are the type of
 
00:33:02.269 --> 00:33:02.279 align:start position:0%
programs I think are very beneficial
 
00:33:04.909 --> 00:33:04.919 align:start position:0%
do you have any statistics in terms of
 
00:33:07.549 --> 00:33:07.559 align:start position:0%
what's the impact you know the positive
 
00:33:09.529 --> 00:33:09.539 align:start position:0%
impact on the people that take them you
 
00:33:11.630 --> 00:33:11.640 align:start position:0%
know are you looking at their you know
 
00:33:13.789 --> 00:33:13.799 align:start position:0%
do they get better job opportunities do
 
00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
they get a raise is there any kind of
 
00:33:19.549 --> 00:33:19.559 align:start position:0%
outcome you know information
 
00:33:22.490 --> 00:33:22.500 align:start position:0%
to help explain why those Investments
 
00:33:25.310 --> 00:33:25.320 align:start position:0%
really pay off for the taxpayers
 
00:33:28.909 --> 00:33:28.919 align:start position:0%
right I I wish I could give you us uh
 
00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:31.080 align:start position:0%
specific set of Statistics I think when
 
00:33:33.529 --> 00:33:33.539 align:start position:0%
we spoke the first time as a when we
 
00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
joined the committee I mentioned for
 
00:33:41.149 --> 00:33:41.159 align:start position:0%
instance 34 3200 nurses registered
 
00:33:43.009 --> 00:33:43.019 align:start position:0%
nurses prepared by the community college
 
00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
system over the last 12 years
 
00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
at least four and we're waiting for the
 
00:33:50.090 --> 00:33:50.100 align:start position:0%
data on the fifth year to see if New
 
00:33:52.190 --> 00:33:52.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire continues to have the highest
 
00:33:56.750 --> 00:33:56.760 align:start position:0%
national pass rate on NCLEX licensure so
 
00:33:58.669 --> 00:33:58.679 align:start position:0%
you know whether it's Automotive we can
 
00:34:01.130 --> 00:34:01.140 align:start position:0%
go field by field and we've prepared
 
00:34:03.370 --> 00:34:03.380 align:start position:0%
roughly a thousand welders with
 
00:34:05.149 --> 00:34:05.159 align:start position:0%
certifications and advanced
 
00:34:07.549 --> 00:34:07.559 align:start position:0%
certifications over the last 12 years as
 
00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:10.200 align:start position:0%
well we can go career area by career
 
00:34:12.470 --> 00:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
area and look at the earnings for people
 
00:34:14.570 --> 00:34:14.580 align:start position:0%
in those fields and demonstrate that
 
00:34:16.730 --> 00:34:16.740 align:start position:0%
value but I don't have a concise chart
 
00:34:19.369 --> 00:34:19.379 align:start position:0%
that I can point to if just as a quick
 
00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
follow-up obviously you know it would be
 
00:34:24.649 --> 00:34:24.659 align:start position:0%
very useful if even something brief
 
00:34:26.329 --> 00:34:26.339 align:start position:0%
could be prepared and shared with us
 
00:34:28.669 --> 00:34:28.679 align:start position:0%
because it's good to be able to show the
 
00:34:30.409 --> 00:34:30.419 align:start position:0%
return on that investment to be able to
 
00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:32.280 align:start position:0%
justify an investment and you know it
 
00:34:35.810 --> 00:34:35.820 align:start position:0%
would be very useful thank you thank you
 
00:34:39.290 --> 00:34:39.300 align:start position:0%
thinking uh Shipyard do you work with
 
00:34:41.990 --> 00:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
them uh you know to further there
 
00:34:44.329 --> 00:34:44.339 align:start position:0%
because it is a lot of use for what you
 
00:34:47.149 --> 00:34:47.159 align:start position:0%
what you teach from from a number of
 
00:34:49.010 --> 00:34:49.020 align:start position:0%
years Great Bay Community College has
 
00:34:50.930 --> 00:34:50.940 align:start position:0%
had a partnership with a port safe
 
00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth Naval Shipyard
 
00:34:56.089 --> 00:34:56.099 align:start position:0%
and does that I mean do you do you work
 
00:34:58.670 --> 00:34:58.680 align:start position:0%
concurrently or do you do you teach and
 
00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:00.720 align:start position:0%
then or do they get in your program and
 
00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
then because they they have a they have
 
00:35:04.730 --> 00:35:04.740 align:start position:0%
an apprenticeship program of their own
 
00:35:07.370 --> 00:35:07.380 align:start position:0%
you you work within that program
 
00:35:09.829 --> 00:35:09.839 align:start position:0%
we I guess I would say it's parallel
 
00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
it's not their apprenticeship program
 
00:35:14.510 --> 00:35:14.520 align:start position:0%
but we provide education professional
 
00:35:22.670 --> 00:35:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:24.170 --> 00:35:24.180 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to talk about two
 
00:35:26.690 --> 00:35:26.700 align:start position:0%
universes that are starting to cross
 
00:35:28.970 --> 00:35:28.980 align:start position:0%
uh you're talking about facility
 
00:35:28.980 --> 00:35:30.829 align:start position:0%
uh you're talking about facility
utilization

00:35:30.829 --> 00:35:30.839 align:start position:0%
utilization
 
00:35:33.589 --> 00:35:33.599 align:start position:0%
if you go to Health and Human Services
 
00:35:37.490 --> 00:35:37.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:40.440 align:start position:0%
I know that the developmentally disabled
 
00:35:43.490 --> 00:35:43.500 align:start position:0%
Community has seven regions uh
 
00:35:47.089 --> 00:35:47.099 align:start position:0%
distributed around the state uh and and
 
00:35:50.450 --> 00:35:50.460 align:start position:0%
they're they're have developed Mental
 
00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:51.410 align:start position:0%
they're they're have developed Mental
Health

00:35:51.410 --> 00:35:51.420 align:start position:0%
Health
 
00:35:54.170 --> 00:35:54.180 align:start position:0%
emergency units that go out into the
 
00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:55.430 align:start position:0%
emergency units that go out into the
areas

00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:55.440 align:start position:0%
areas
 
00:35:57.890 --> 00:35:57.900 align:start position:0%
so my thought process and this is where
 
00:36:00.290 --> 00:36:00.300 align:start position:0%
the two universes cross is get together
 
00:36:02.270 --> 00:36:02.280 align:start position:0%
with whoever it is in health and human
 
00:36:04.730 --> 00:36:04.740 align:start position:0%
services that needs locations
 
00:36:07.310 --> 00:36:07.320 align:start position:0%
and you may you may find you know a new
 
00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:08.950 align:start position:0%
and you may you may find you know a new
tenant

00:36:08.950 --> 00:36:08.960 align:start position:0%
tenant
 
00:36:11.870 --> 00:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
we are having conversations our
 
00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
Rochester uh facilities currently
 
00:36:18.170 --> 00:36:18.180 align:start position:0%
hosting career counselors from DHHS for
 
00:36:19.849 --> 00:36:19.859 align:start position:0%
instance those are the kinds of
 
00:36:22.190 --> 00:36:22.200 align:start position:0%
Partnerships that we think are helpful
 
00:36:24.170 --> 00:36:24.180 align:start position:0%
for us to establish and we'll continue
 
00:36:26.210 --> 00:36:26.220 align:start position:0%
to explore those
 
00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:27.890 align:start position:0%
to explore those
foreign

00:36:27.890 --> 00:36:27.900 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:36:30.410 --> 00:36:30.420 align:start position:0%
thank you um can you talk a little bit
 
00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:31.310 align:start position:0%
thank you um can you talk a little bit
about

00:36:31.310 --> 00:36:31.320 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:36:33.530 --> 00:36:33.540 align:start position:0%
um expand Workforce credential programs
 
00:36:36.170 --> 00:36:36.180 align:start position:0%
I think that that and could you relate
 
00:36:39.950 --> 00:36:39.960 align:start position:0%
that to would that be income driving for
 
00:36:42.670 --> 00:36:42.680 align:start position:0%
your programs
 
00:36:45.790 --> 00:36:45.800 align:start position:0%
they they would be currently most of our
 
00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
Workforce uh related programs are Break
 
00:36:50.569 --> 00:36:50.579 align:start position:0%
Even roughly
 
00:36:50.579 --> 00:36:51.770 align:start position:0%
Even roughly
well

00:36:51.770 --> 00:36:51.780 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:53.569 align:start position:0%
well
um

00:36:53.569 --> 00:36:53.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:55.440 align:start position:0%
medical assisting
 
00:36:59.089 --> 00:36:59.099 align:start position:0%
yeah l and a type programs but also
 
00:36:59.099 --> 00:37:00.650 align:start position:0%
yeah l and a type programs but also
um

00:37:00.650 --> 00:37:00.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:03.050 --> 00:37:03.060 align:start position:0%
trying to think of some of the other uh
 
00:37:05.690 --> 00:37:05.700 align:start position:0%
exams do a lot of training on things
 
00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:08.640 align:start position:0%
like Excel basically off you know office
 
00:37:11.089 --> 00:37:11.099 align:start position:0%
tools for people already in the
 
00:37:11.099 --> 00:37:12.710 align:start position:0%
tools for people already in the
workforce

00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:12.720 align:start position:0%
workforce
 
00:37:15.230 --> 00:37:15.240 align:start position:0%
um but almost anything we currently do
 
00:37:17.870 --> 00:37:17.880 align:start position:0%
on a credit basis and I'll offer the
 
00:37:20.329 --> 00:37:20.339 align:start position:0%
example earlier we currently offer a CDL
 
00:37:21.950 --> 00:37:21.960 align:start position:0%
program as a credit based program
 
00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
through White Mountains Community
 
00:37:25.810 --> 00:37:25.820 align:start position:0%
College that could be turned into a
 
00:37:29.530 --> 00:37:29.540 align:start position:0%
non-credit Workforce program with a more
 
00:37:32.210 --> 00:37:32.220 align:start position:0%
concise timeline to allow people to be
 
00:37:35.329 --> 00:37:35.339 align:start position:0%
up and running more quickly
 
00:37:37.970 --> 00:37:37.980 align:start position:0%
just as a follow-up actually to build on
 
00:37:40.730 --> 00:37:40.740 align:start position:0%
what you were asking about our mental
 
00:37:43.849 --> 00:37:43.859 align:start position:0%
health centers are really struggling
 
00:37:47.390 --> 00:37:47.400 align:start position:0%
um do you offer programs
 
00:37:49.609 --> 00:37:49.619 align:start position:0%
um that would produce workers I the
 
00:37:51.410 --> 00:37:51.420 align:start position:0%
whole problem is we have a shortage of
 
00:37:54.290 --> 00:37:54.300 align:start position:0%
Workforce quite frankly but in Preparing
 
00:37:56.210 --> 00:37:56.220 align:start position:0%
People to work in the field of mental
 
00:37:57.650 --> 00:37:57.660 align:start position:0%
health because that's really an area
 
00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:00.720 align:start position:0%
that's problematic right now we we do we
 
00:38:03.050 --> 00:38:03.060 align:start position:0%
have a certified community support
 
00:38:05.589 --> 00:38:05.599 align:start position:0%
workers we have
 
00:38:08.810 --> 00:38:08.820 align:start position:0%
programs with substance misuse and
 
00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
recovery programs along those lines and
 
00:38:13.910 --> 00:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
again we also have the potential to
 
00:38:16.550 --> 00:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
build programs that would align with
 
00:38:18.170 --> 00:38:18.180 align:start position:0%
those needs particularly for Frontline
 
00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:19.849 align:start position:0%
those needs particularly for Frontline
workers

00:38:19.849 --> 00:38:19.859 align:start position:0%
workers
 
00:38:24.530 --> 00:38:24.540 align:start position:0%
so that potential would cost 1.5 million
 
00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:25.810 align:start position:0%
so that potential would cost 1.5 million
well

00:38:25.810 --> 00:38:25.820 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:38:28.130 --> 00:38:28.140 align:start position:0%
we thought that was a reasonable
 
00:38:30.829 --> 00:38:30.839 align:start position:0%
investment to request to allow us to
 
00:38:33.170 --> 00:38:33.180 align:start position:0%
begin to scale those kinds of programs
 
00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
it's potentially a limitless opportunity
 
00:38:37.849 --> 00:38:37.859 align:start position:0%
but we are trying to make sure that we
 
00:38:40.990 --> 00:38:41.000 align:start position:0%
could do it in a in a in a way that
 
00:38:44.750 --> 00:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
reflected quality and and allowed us to
 
00:38:47.690 --> 00:38:47.700 align:start position:0%
focus on what we could do well
 
00:38:51.349 --> 00:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:51.359 --> 00:38:52.910 align:start position:0%
 
start

00:38:52.910 --> 00:38:52.920 align:start position:0%
start
 
00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:54.170 align:start position:0%
start
um I

00:38:54.170 --> 00:38:54.180 align:start position:0%
um I
 
00:38:56.810 --> 00:38:56.820 align:start position:0%
I believe it's it's a way to get a
 
00:38:59.690 --> 00:38:59.700 align:start position:0%
pathway to your programs
 
00:39:01.970 --> 00:39:01.980 align:start position:0%
um and it's really cost effective for
 
00:39:04.970 --> 00:39:04.980 align:start position:0%
our students in terms of reducing the
 
00:39:08.030 --> 00:39:08.040 align:start position:0%
four-year cost of their education
 
00:39:11.630 --> 00:39:11.640 align:start position:0%
um so by increasing
 
00:39:14.690 --> 00:39:14.700 align:start position:0%
what how many more students would you be
 
00:39:18.190 --> 00:39:18.200 align:start position:0%
able to offer scholarships to with the
 
00:39:21.069 --> 00:39:21.079 align:start position:0%
3.25 of the pre
 
00:39:25.069 --> 00:39:25.079 align:start position:0%
3.25 million well in a typical Year
 
00:39:28.250 --> 00:39:28.260 align:start position:0%
we're serving about 8 000 students
 
00:39:30.730 --> 00:39:30.740 align:start position:0%
through that program
 
00:39:33.290 --> 00:39:33.300 align:start position:0%
the increase in funding that we're
 
00:39:36.050 --> 00:39:36.060 align:start position:0%
looking at potentially an additional two
 
00:39:38.930 --> 00:39:38.940 align:start position:0%
to four thousand students they want to
 
00:39:40.910 --> 00:39:40.920 align:start position:0%
qualify because part of the way this is
 
00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
structured is that students could take
 
00:39:45.050 --> 00:39:45.060 align:start position:0%
more classes so it may not be
 
00:39:47.030 --> 00:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
two to four thousand more students it
 
00:39:48.770 --> 00:39:48.780 align:start position:0%
may be one or two thousand more students
 
00:39:50.510 --> 00:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
but those students having opportunity at
 
00:39:52.190 --> 00:39:52.200 align:start position:0%
least some of them to take more courses
 
00:39:54.589 --> 00:39:54.599 align:start position:0%
than they currently have and the cost
 
00:39:57.770 --> 00:39:57.780 align:start position:0%
continues at 150 for those choosing to
 
00:40:04.130 --> 00:40:04.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:05.810 --> 00:40:05.820 align:start position:0%
um two quick questions I missed
 
00:40:07.250 --> 00:40:07.260 align:start position:0%
something around the Board of Trustees
 
00:40:08.450 --> 00:40:08.460 align:start position:0%
and the retirement plans they have
 
00:40:10.250 --> 00:40:10.260 align:start position:0%
authority to make decisions what
 
00:40:10.260 --> 00:40:11.930 align:start position:0%
authority to make decisions what
decision

00:40:11.930 --> 00:40:11.940 align:start position:0%
decision
 
00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:13.010 align:start position:0%
decision
well

00:40:13.010 --> 00:40:13.020 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:40:15.290 --> 00:40:15.300 align:start position:0%
and presently in statute that's
 
00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
something that has to be negotiated
 
00:40:20.410 --> 00:40:20.420 align:start position:0%
whether or not uh the
 
00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
employees represented by collective
 
00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:24.720 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreements will choose an
 
00:40:27.589 --> 00:40:27.599 align:start position:0%
alternative plan for our staff who are
 
00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
represented by the sca they several
 
00:40:32.270 --> 00:40:32.280 align:start position:0%
years ago introduced that as an option
 
00:40:33.829 --> 00:40:33.839 align:start position:0%
that they can choose either this state
 
00:40:36.170 --> 00:40:36.180 align:start position:0%
Employee Retirement System or a program
 
00:40:38.930 --> 00:40:38.940 align:start position:0%
administered by a private provider a 403
 
00:40:42.109 --> 00:40:42.119 align:start position:0%
b plan for our full-time faculty there's
 
00:40:45.410 --> 00:40:45.420 align:start position:0%
no option and the only option is the the
 
00:40:48.349 --> 00:40:48.359 align:start position:0%
state Employee Retirement System this
 
00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:50.640 align:start position:0%
would give the Board of Trustees the
 
00:40:52.490 --> 00:40:52.500 align:start position:0%
authority to make a decision that that
 
00:40:54.349 --> 00:40:54.359 align:start position:0%
is an option
 
00:40:57.170 --> 00:40:57.180 align:start position:0%
what's the option that's just an
 
00:40:59.089 --> 00:40:59.099 align:start position:0%
alternative plan to the state Employee
 
00:41:00.410 --> 00:41:00.420 align:start position:0%
Retirement System so it's offering The
 
00:41:03.290 --> 00:41:03.300 align:start position:0%
Faculty an alternative plan okay or I I
 
00:41:05.390 --> 00:41:05.400 align:start position:0%
want to be clear I haven't seen the
 
00:41:08.990 --> 00:41:09.000 align:start position:0%
precise language but if if it falls it
 
00:41:10.130 --> 00:41:10.140 align:start position:0%
could be the board would have the
 
00:41:11.690 --> 00:41:11.700 align:start position:0%
authority to make a decision that after
 
00:41:14.510 --> 00:41:14.520 align:start position:0%
a certain date newly hired employees
 
00:41:18.650 --> 00:41:18.660 align:start position:0%
would have only that alternative option
 
00:41:22.130 --> 00:41:22.140 align:start position:0%
and I think the university system opted
 
00:41:24.050 --> 00:41:24.060 align:start position:0%
out of the state plan
 
00:41:26.930 --> 00:41:26.940 align:start position:0%
two two years ago three years ago so I I
 
00:41:28.730 --> 00:41:28.740 align:start position:0%
I I I don't know that the university
 
00:41:31.609 --> 00:41:31.619 align:start position:0%
system has been in that plan if ever
 
00:41:35.569 --> 00:41:35.579 align:start position:0%
certainly for decades okay I I I was in
 
00:41:37.910 --> 00:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
division one before and there was some
 
00:41:41.329 --> 00:41:41.339 align:start position:0%
of this in hb2 having to do with UNH and
 
00:41:43.730 --> 00:41:43.740 align:start position:0%
I can't remember what the machinations
 
00:41:46.970 --> 00:41:46.980 align:start position:0%
were all about but I I
 
00:41:50.510 --> 00:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter now the the old
 
00:41:55.010 --> 00:41:55.020 align:start position:0%
I I can I can think of one element that
 
00:41:56.690 --> 00:41:56.700 align:start position:0%
would have come up but I don't know that
 
00:41:58.490 --> 00:41:58.500 align:start position:0%
it's Jermaine
 
00:41:58.500 --> 00:42:00.010 align:start position:0%
it's Jermaine
foreign

00:42:00.010 --> 00:42:00.020 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:42:03.470 --> 00:42:03.480 align:start position:0%
I always think I ask this some of the
 
00:42:05.089 --> 00:42:05.099 align:start position:0%
areas in which you train people which
 
00:42:06.650 --> 00:42:06.660 align:start position:0%
are critical you know the Early
 
00:42:08.569 --> 00:42:08.579 align:start position:0%
Childhood the nursing they're still
 
00:42:11.870 --> 00:42:11.880 align:start position:0%
underpaid and it's a blessing to them
 
00:42:13.550 --> 00:42:13.560 align:start position:0%
that they have an alternative to go with
 
00:42:15.589 --> 00:42:15.599 align:start position:0%
you as opposed to I always go back to
 
00:42:17.690 --> 00:42:17.700 align:start position:0%
the Dartmouth student who all she wanted
 
00:42:19.609 --> 00:42:19.619 align:start position:0%
to do was teach Pilates and ended up
 
00:42:23.150 --> 00:42:23.160 align:start position:0%
with you know 160 000 of debt
 
00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:23.810 align:start position:0%
with you know 160 000 of debt
um

00:42:23.810 --> 00:42:23.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:27.170 --> 00:42:27.180 align:start position:0%
what can you do as advocates for
 
00:42:29.930 --> 00:42:29.940 align:start position:0%
increasing salary ranges or you know
 
00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
what can you do to help these students
 
00:42:33.349 --> 00:42:33.359 align:start position:0%
that you're training to go into
 
00:42:35.150 --> 00:42:35.160 align:start position:0%
basically what I still consider to be
 
00:42:37.970 --> 00:42:37.980 align:start position:0%
low-income jobs
 
00:42:40.250 --> 00:42:40.260 align:start position:0%
um I'll be honest say there may be
 
00:42:42.410 --> 00:42:42.420 align:start position:0%
limits on what we can do but what we're
 
00:42:44.690 --> 00:42:44.700 align:start position:0%
trying to do is manage the pieces we can
 
00:42:48.410 --> 00:42:48.420 align:start position:0%
control if we can help people get the
 
00:42:50.810 --> 00:42:50.820 align:start position:0%
foundation that they need to pursue the
 
00:42:53.390 --> 00:42:53.400 align:start position:0%
career they care about without incurring
 
00:42:55.730 --> 00:42:55.740 align:start position:0%
the expense or the debt that accompanies
 
00:42:57.650 --> 00:42:57.660 align:start position:0%
it we're at least creating the
 
00:42:59.809 --> 00:42:59.819 align:start position:0%
opportunity that for the subsequent
 
00:43:02.150 --> 00:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
education they may need to progress in
 
00:43:05.089 --> 00:43:05.099 align:start position:0%
that field that they're not saddled with
 
00:43:07.370 --> 00:43:07.380 align:start position:0%
with the earlier debt that that may be a
 
00:43:09.650 --> 00:43:09.660 align:start position:0%
barrier so our efforts are to try and
 
00:43:12.109 --> 00:43:12.119 align:start position:0%
enable as much forward motion as we can
 
00:43:16.430 --> 00:43:16.440 align:start position:0%
within our scope of ability thank you
 
00:43:19.069 --> 00:43:19.079 align:start position:0%
I may shed a bit more light on this
 
00:43:21.290 --> 00:43:21.300 align:start position:0%
situation I worked when I worked you
 
00:43:23.390 --> 00:43:23.400 align:start position:0%
know taught those classes I worked for
 
00:43:25.790 --> 00:43:25.800 align:start position:0%
both private employed training centers
 
00:43:27.770 --> 00:43:27.780 align:start position:0%
and public universities that had these
 
00:43:29.270 --> 00:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
types of programs
 
00:43:31.970 --> 00:43:31.980 align:start position:0%
none of them had to directly advocate
 
00:43:34.690 --> 00:43:34.700 align:start position:0%
for their graduates to get higher wages
 
00:43:37.730 --> 00:43:37.740 align:start position:0%
because what they did in improving their
 
00:43:40.130 --> 00:43:40.140 align:start position:0%
skills made them significantly more
 
00:43:43.069 --> 00:43:43.079 align:start position:0%
valuable and frankly you know that may
 
00:43:45.770 --> 00:43:45.780 align:start position:0%
lead to people going out of state to get
 
00:43:47.690 --> 00:43:47.700 align:start position:0%
a higher paid job but people who are
 
00:43:50.750 --> 00:43:50.760 align:start position:0%
highly skilled have access to you know
 
00:43:53.329 --> 00:43:53.339 align:start position:0%
better jobs without the need for the
 
00:43:55.670 --> 00:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
entity who trains them to take care of
 
00:43:57.589 --> 00:43:57.599 align:start position:0%
that but by giving them the skills we
 
00:44:00.349 --> 00:44:00.359 align:start position:0%
are empowering them to negotiate and get
 
00:44:02.270 --> 00:44:02.280 align:start position:0%
into the right situation for themselves
 
00:44:04.609 --> 00:44:04.619 align:start position:0%
and I think that's a highly valuable you
 
00:44:07.730 --> 00:44:07.740 align:start position:0%
know effort and I think doing that makes
 
00:44:09.410 --> 00:44:09.420 align:start position:0%
much more difference than you would
 
00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
possibly make by you know lobbying for
 
00:44:16.490 --> 00:44:16.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:16.500 --> 00:44:17.450 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:44:17.450 --> 00:44:17.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:20.809 --> 00:44:20.819 align:start position:0%
how much land do you have or
 
00:44:23.270 --> 00:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
the ability to expand
 
00:44:26.990 --> 00:44:27.000 align:start position:0%
I I really uh I want to comment on the
 
00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
uh Great Bay use of uh the old uh
 
00:44:33.829 --> 00:44:33.839 align:start position:0%
buildings on the mall and uh on the on
 
00:44:36.130 --> 00:44:36.140 align:start position:0%
the Milton Road I mean that's a great
 
00:44:39.290 --> 00:44:39.300 align:start position:0%
repurpose of uh and it and it fits
 
00:44:41.690 --> 00:44:41.700 align:start position:0%
almost perfectly with with the high
 
00:44:44.210 --> 00:44:44.220 align:start position:0%
school you know Spalding High School in
 
00:44:46.490 --> 00:44:46.500 align:start position:0%
Rochester I mean that's that's that's
 
00:44:49.790 --> 00:44:49.800 align:start position:0%
brilliant as far as I'm concerned but uh
 
00:44:51.589 --> 00:44:51.599 align:start position:0%
how much other you know how much other
 
00:44:54.530 --> 00:44:54.540 align:start position:0%
properties and going along with uh
 
00:44:56.990 --> 00:44:57.000 align:start position:0%
chairman emmerich here uh you know some
 
00:44:59.270 --> 00:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
of these could be repurp you know you
 
00:45:02.390 --> 00:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
could expand you know so DHHS could
 
00:45:05.089 --> 00:45:05.099 align:start position:0%
co-locate with you and save uh you know
 
00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
the save of the state money and DHHS
 
00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:08.030 align:start position:0%
the save of the state money and DHHS
money

00:45:08.030 --> 00:45:08.040 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
yeah it's going to vary by by college
 
00:45:13.730 --> 00:45:13.740 align:start position:0%
around the state and particular location
 
00:45:16.550 --> 00:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
I'll tell you that the place where we've
 
00:45:18.349 --> 00:45:18.359 align:start position:0%
spent the most time discussing this
 
00:45:22.069 --> 00:45:22.079 align:start position:0%
happens to be nhti the largest physical
 
00:45:25.550 --> 00:45:25.560 align:start position:0%
footprint of any of our colleges and has
 
00:45:28.970 --> 00:45:28.980 align:start position:0%
some great potential for reallocation of
 
00:45:31.670 --> 00:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
space I spoke with Patrick Tompkins the
 
00:45:33.290 --> 00:45:33.300 align:start position:0%
new president of Manchester this morning
 
00:45:36.109 --> 00:45:36.119 align:start position:0%
about this and they are looking at the
 
00:45:38.210 --> 00:45:38.220 align:start position:0%
physical footprint they currently occupy
 
00:45:40.190 --> 00:45:40.200 align:start position:0%
how they're using that space and the
 
00:45:43.010 --> 00:45:43.020 align:start position:0%
intent is to figure out is there a way
 
00:45:46.190 --> 00:45:46.200 align:start position:0%
to bring their primary uses of the space
 
00:45:49.430 --> 00:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
together more cohesively to free up
 
00:45:51.109 --> 00:45:51.119 align:start position:0%
other parts of the campus for other
 
00:45:54.109 --> 00:45:54.119 align:start position:0%
purposes and again whether it's state
 
00:45:56.770 --> 00:45:56.780 align:start position:0%
agencies or
 
00:45:58.790 --> 00:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
non-profit agencies or other
 
00:46:00.530 --> 00:46:00.540 align:start position:0%
organizations whose missions are
 
00:46:02.270 --> 00:46:02.280 align:start position:0%
complementary to the work that we do
 
00:46:04.730 --> 00:46:04.740 align:start position:0%
that would make more impact for those
 
00:46:07.970 --> 00:46:07.980 align:start position:0%
communities we see real potential there
 
00:46:10.970 --> 00:46:10.980 align:start position:0%
I I will say I I had reached out to
 
00:46:12.829 --> 00:46:12.839 align:start position:0%
commissioner arlinghaus to acknowledge
 
00:46:15.349 --> 00:46:15.359 align:start position:0%
that the state has right of first
 
00:46:18.170 --> 00:46:18.180 align:start position:0%
refusal on anything that we have and and
 
00:46:20.450 --> 00:46:20.460 align:start position:0%
for me that's probably one of the best
 
00:46:22.190 --> 00:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
opportunities to partner with the state
 
00:46:24.530 --> 00:46:24.540 align:start position:0%
uh to see if there's some co-locations
 
00:46:32.150 --> 00:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:34.550 --> 00:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
moments across the state
 
00:46:38.690 --> 00:46:38.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:40.609 --> 00:46:40.619 align:start position:0%
over five percent
 
00:46:43.790 --> 00:46:43.800 align:start position:0%
over what period of time or well covert
 
00:46:46.430 --> 00:46:46.440 align:start position:0%
has hurt a lot of people
 
00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:48.650 align:start position:0%
has hurt a lot of people
what

00:46:48.650 --> 00:46:48.660 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:46:52.309 --> 00:46:52.319 align:start position:0%
if asked what would convince
 
00:46:55.910 --> 00:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
my constituents that we should invest
 
00:46:57.530 --> 00:46:57.540 align:start position:0%
more money
 
00:46:59.809 --> 00:46:59.819 align:start position:0%
I mean because the governor's budget um
 
00:47:04.130 --> 00:47:04.140 align:start position:0%
that that is a good amount but which I
 
00:47:07.250 --> 00:47:07.260 align:start position:0%
was very happy to see it what would
 
00:47:09.650 --> 00:47:09.660 align:start position:0%
convince my constituents to want to
 
00:47:11.329 --> 00:47:11.339 align:start position:0%
invest more money
 
00:47:14.809 --> 00:47:14.819 align:start position:0%
in a system that right now is not
 
00:47:17.990 --> 00:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
busting at the seams and actually has
 
00:47:20.930 --> 00:47:20.940 align:start position:0%
slowed down a bit well I think I shared
 
00:47:24.589 --> 00:47:24.599 align:start position:0%
in our first meeting that that's a
 
00:47:26.270 --> 00:47:26.280 align:start position:0%
national Trend and it's been going on
 
00:47:28.490 --> 00:47:28.500 align:start position:0%
for 12 years since the end of the last
 
00:47:31.490 --> 00:47:31.500 align:start position:0%
Great Recession 2011 you can see a peak
 
00:47:33.770 --> 00:47:33.780 align:start position:0%
in Community College enrollments and
 
00:47:36.589 --> 00:47:36.599 align:start position:0%
then the the trend has been down
 
00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:40.200 align:start position:0%
but the need is not less and it's not
 
00:47:42.650 --> 00:47:42.660 align:start position:0%
about the demographics of fewer 18 year
 
00:47:44.630 --> 00:47:44.640 align:start position:0%
olds in high school
 
00:47:47.450 --> 00:47:47.460 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we saw with a
 
00:47:50.030 --> 00:47:50.040 align:start position:0%
pandemic not just how acutely disruptive
 
00:47:52.190 --> 00:47:52.200 align:start position:0%
it was to the lives of students who
 
00:47:53.870 --> 00:47:53.880 align:start position:0%
attend community colleges but to
 
00:47:57.950 --> 00:47:57.960 align:start position:0%
everybody it required the rapid scaling
 
00:48:01.250 --> 00:48:01.260 align:start position:0%
up of different kinds of occupations it
 
00:48:03.230 --> 00:48:03.240 align:start position:0%
required people to change the way they
 
00:48:06.050 --> 00:48:06.060 align:start position:0%
worked and what they were doing
 
00:48:08.690 --> 00:48:08.700 align:start position:0%
our our vision over time for the
 
00:48:10.490 --> 00:48:10.500 align:start position:0%
non-traditional the adult learner is
 
00:48:12.290 --> 00:48:12.300 align:start position:0%
that the need for education is actually
 
00:48:14.450 --> 00:48:14.460 align:start position:0%
going to grow and it's not going to be
 
00:48:16.609 --> 00:48:16.619 align:start position:0%
the two or four years of college that
 
00:48:18.470 --> 00:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
you have After High School that sets
 
00:48:20.210 --> 00:48:20.220 align:start position:0%
your path for the rest of your life it's
 
00:48:22.069 --> 00:48:22.079 align:start position:0%
the education that you need that's
 
00:48:24.589 --> 00:48:24.599 align:start position:0%
accessible in an ongoing basis as your
 
00:48:28.130 --> 00:48:28.140 align:start position:0%
life changes industry you know for let's
 
00:48:30.410 --> 00:48:30.420 align:start position:0%
hope for not another pandemic but
 
00:48:32.630 --> 00:48:32.640 align:start position:0%
Industries change technology changes
 
00:48:34.250 --> 00:48:34.260 align:start position:0%
people's lives and interests and
 
00:48:36.109 --> 00:48:36.119 align:start position:0%
abilities change and they've got to be
 
00:48:38.390 --> 00:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
able to prepare for that so we are
 
00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
trying to reorient the way that we serve
 
00:48:44.329 --> 00:48:44.339 align:start position:0%
that part of the the universe of
 
00:48:46.609 --> 00:48:46.619 align:start position:0%
Learners who are not 18 and 19 coming
 
00:48:49.010 --> 00:48:49.020 align:start position:0%
out of high school having said that the
 
00:48:50.569 --> 00:48:50.579 align:start position:0%
other part of our work is more
 
00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
foundational helping students get that
 
00:48:54.890 --> 00:48:54.900 align:start position:0%
good start so the dual enrollment to
 
00:48:57.770 --> 00:48:57.780 align:start position:0%
allow academically motivated students to
 
00:48:59.990 --> 00:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
to rise to that challenge and maintain
 
00:49:02.750 --> 00:49:02.760 align:start position:0%
the passion for learning that will set a
 
00:49:05.150 --> 00:49:05.160 align:start position:0%
course for the rest of their lives to
 
00:49:06.650 --> 00:49:06.660 align:start position:0%
help those students and their families
 
00:49:08.270 --> 00:49:08.280 align:start position:0%
who are facing challenges with
 
00:49:10.069 --> 00:49:10.079 align:start position:0%
affordability and not just the neediest
 
00:49:11.809 --> 00:49:11.819 align:start position:0%
families but the middle class family who
 
00:49:14.030 --> 00:49:14.040 align:start position:0%
is not going to get federal aid to
 
00:49:15.770 --> 00:49:15.780 align:start position:0%
manage the cost of post-secondary
 
00:49:18.349 --> 00:49:18.359 align:start position:0%
Education whether that's a certificate
 
00:49:20.030 --> 00:49:20.040 align:start position:0%
in welding whether that's a degree
 
00:49:21.710 --> 00:49:21.720 align:start position:0%
whether that's a path to medicine
 
00:49:24.050 --> 00:49:24.060 align:start position:0%
whatever it happens to be we're trying
 
00:49:27.290 --> 00:49:27.300 align:start position:0%
to manage that as well
 
00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
um I think I shared in our first meeting
 
00:49:32.030 --> 00:49:32.040 align:start position:0%
the most recent data from Department of
 
00:49:34.609 --> 00:49:34.619 align:start position:0%
Education 22 percent of the students in
 
00:49:36.170 --> 00:49:36.180 align:start position:0%
this state are eligible for free and
 
00:49:38.109 --> 00:49:38.119 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch
 
00:49:41.510 --> 00:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
that number is more than one in five and
 
00:49:43.910 --> 00:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
it's you know more than that here in
 
00:49:45.589 --> 00:49:45.599 align:start position:0%
Concord much more than that in
 
00:49:47.930 --> 00:49:47.940 align:start position:0%
Manchester Rochester Laconia Berlin
 
00:49:50.210 --> 00:49:50.220 align:start position:0%
Nashua you can go around the state and
 
00:49:51.910 --> 00:49:51.920 align:start position:0%
find communities where that
 
00:49:54.109 --> 00:49:54.119 align:start position:0%
affordability for post-secondary
 
00:49:56.450 --> 00:49:56.460 align:start position:0%
education or for life is an increasing
 
00:49:59.030 --> 00:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
pressure on this state if it's a barrier
 
00:50:01.430 --> 00:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
to people engaging in the workforce
 
00:50:03.109 --> 00:50:03.119 align:start position:0%
because they can't get the education
 
00:50:04.550 --> 00:50:04.560 align:start position:0%
that allows them to pursue those
 
00:50:06.050 --> 00:50:06.060 align:start position:0%
opportunities that's going to be
 
00:50:07.730 --> 00:50:07.740 align:start position:0%
detrimental to them but it's going to be
 
00:50:09.950 --> 00:50:09.960 align:start position:0%
really detrimental to this state
 
00:50:12.470 --> 00:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
you can automate a lot of things and you
 
00:50:14.630 --> 00:50:14.640 align:start position:0%
can you can Outsource some things but so
 
00:50:16.309 --> 00:50:16.319 align:start position:0%
much of what we're going to need in this
 
00:50:19.309 --> 00:50:19.319 align:start position:0%
state in healthcare and Human Services
 
00:50:19.319 --> 00:50:20.569 align:start position:0%
state in healthcare and Human Services
in

00:50:20.569 --> 00:50:20.579 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:50:22.730 --> 00:50:22.740 align:start position:0%
travel and tourism here in this state
 
00:50:24.770 --> 00:50:24.780 align:start position:0%
can't be outsourced can't be replaced by
 
00:50:27.530 --> 00:50:27.540 align:start position:0%
technology and we've got to find ways to
 
00:50:28.970 --> 00:50:28.980 align:start position:0%
have opportunities for people to be
 
00:50:30.650 --> 00:50:30.660 align:start position:0%
engaged in what's here in New Hampshire
 
00:50:30.660 --> 00:50:31.790 align:start position:0%
engaged in what's here in New Hampshire
so

00:50:31.790 --> 00:50:31.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:50:34.190 --> 00:50:34.200 align:start position:0%
from my vantage point the demographics
 
00:50:36.349 --> 00:50:36.359 align:start position:0%
and the trend lines have been down but
 
00:50:38.089 --> 00:50:38.099 align:start position:0%
it's only because we haven't been able
 
00:50:41.510 --> 00:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
to reorient our focus on where there's a
 
00:50:44.510 --> 00:50:44.520 align:start position:0%
growing need that we've got to meet
 
00:50:44.520 --> 00:50:47.829 align:start position:0%
growing need that we've got to meet
foreign

00:50:47.829 --> 00:50:47.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:50.510 --> 00:50:50.520 align:start position:0%
advertising you know I don't see a lot
 
00:50:52.730 --> 00:50:52.740 align:start position:0%
of advertising community college system
 
00:50:54.950 --> 00:50:54.960 align:start position:0%
and you look at Southern New Hampshire I
 
00:50:56.750 --> 00:50:56.760 align:start position:0%
mean they're flush with money and I mean
 
00:50:58.490 --> 00:50:58.500 align:start position:0%
they're all I mean you you go across the
 
00:51:00.049 --> 00:51:00.059 align:start position:0%
country and you'll you'll see an ad for
 
00:51:02.390 --> 00:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
them uh what what are you what are your
 
00:51:05.510 --> 00:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
plans to uh get your message out
 
00:51:08.690 --> 00:51:08.700 align:start position:0%
well let me say that our best
 
00:51:11.990 --> 00:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
endorsement are our graduates and you
 
00:51:14.390 --> 00:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
you walk in any hospital and you don't
 
00:51:16.609 --> 00:51:16.619 align:start position:0%
go far before you've run into one of our
 
00:51:18.290 --> 00:51:18.300 align:start position:0%
folks if you need to have a vehicle
 
00:51:20.510 --> 00:51:20.520 align:start position:0%
serviced in the state pretty good chance
 
00:51:21.829 --> 00:51:21.839 align:start position:0%
you're going to have one of our
 
00:51:24.170 --> 00:51:24.180 align:start position:0%
graduates working on your car
 
00:51:27.109 --> 00:51:27.119 align:start position:0%
and go through almost anything that
 
00:51:28.670 --> 00:51:28.680 align:start position:0%
people need in New Hampshire and it's
 
00:51:29.829 --> 00:51:29.839 align:start position:0%
Word of Mouth
 
00:51:33.230 --> 00:51:33.240 align:start position:0%
we're we're I said earlier we want to be
 
00:51:35.030 --> 00:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
respectful in the budget process of what
 
00:51:37.670 --> 00:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
we asked for also fairly Frugal about
 
00:51:40.069 --> 00:51:40.079 align:start position:0%
how we tell our story and maybe a little
 
00:51:42.890 --> 00:51:42.900 align:start position:0%
bit you know too too subtle but
 
00:51:44.589 --> 00:51:44.599 align:start position:0%
it's a resource question
 
00:51:46.910 --> 00:51:46.920 align:start position:0%
right well I want to I just want to make
 
00:51:49.970 --> 00:51:49.980 align:start position:0%
a comment when I get service from you
 
00:51:52.549 --> 00:51:52.559 align:start position:0%
know kids or I mean everybody's a kid to
 
00:51:55.190 --> 00:51:55.200 align:start position:0%
me I guess I'm so old but uh you know
 
00:51:58.250 --> 00:51:58.260 align:start position:0%
I'm very proud especially in HTI I mean
 
00:52:00.890 --> 00:52:00.900 align:start position:0%
you see some kids that really are really
 
00:52:02.569 --> 00:52:02.579 align:start position:0%
outstanding what they do you know
 
00:52:05.809 --> 00:52:05.819 align:start position:0%
Radiology for one or a nurse I mean it's
 
00:52:07.910 --> 00:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
dental hygienist I mean I mean every
 
00:52:09.950 --> 00:52:09.960 align:start position:0%
place you go it seems so you run into a
 
00:52:12.049 --> 00:52:12.059 align:start position:0%
you know a community college student and
 
00:52:14.690 --> 00:52:14.700 align:start position:0%
that's that's very refreshing I I should
 
00:52:16.910 --> 00:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
add one other point which is that if
 
00:52:18.890 --> 00:52:18.900 align:start position:0%
you're not seeing our ads that's
 
00:52:20.809 --> 00:52:20.819 align:start position:0%
probably because you're not our primary
 
00:52:23.990 --> 00:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
demographic and I I should acknowledge
 
00:52:26.270 --> 00:52:26.280 align:start position:0%
that more of more of what we do is
 
00:52:28.910 --> 00:52:28.920 align:start position:0%
digital and it's in places where we know
 
00:52:30.589 --> 00:52:30.599 align:start position:0%
we're going to find the people who are
 
00:52:32.750 --> 00:52:32.760 align:start position:0%
looking for us so is no offense and
 
00:52:36.430 --> 00:52:36.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:38.930 --> 00:52:38.940 align:start position:0%
then then maybe we've got to find your
 
00:52:42.890 --> 00:52:42.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:42.900 --> 00:52:53.470 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:52:53.470 --> 00:52:53.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:56.690 --> 00:52:56.700 align:start position:0%
just to build up on representative hits
 
00:52:59.210 --> 00:52:59.220 align:start position:0%
questions about you know in you know
 
00:53:01.250 --> 00:53:01.260 align:start position:0%
what we can do
 
00:53:03.410 --> 00:53:03.420 align:start position:0%
I find that training
 
00:53:06.589 --> 00:53:06.599 align:start position:0%
has to be in person to really truly be
 
00:53:08.690 --> 00:53:08.700 align:start position:0%
effective we've all seen the impact that
 
00:53:10.790 --> 00:53:10.800 align:start position:0%
kovit had on our students of all ages
 
00:53:13.549 --> 00:53:13.559 align:start position:0%
from K to graduates college students to
 
00:53:13.559 --> 00:53:14.809 align:start position:0%
from K to graduates college students to
everybody

00:53:14.809 --> 00:53:14.819 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
00:53:16.849 --> 00:53:16.859 align:start position:0%
there are times and places where you
 
00:53:18.530 --> 00:53:18.540 align:start position:0%
know remote learning is possible and
 
00:53:20.569 --> 00:53:20.579 align:start position:0%
works fine I mean God knows I took some
 
00:53:23.630 --> 00:53:23.640 align:start position:0%
of my CPA credits I you know I took
 
00:53:25.970 --> 00:53:25.980 align:start position:0%
accounting classes from LSU remotely and
 
00:53:28.609 --> 00:53:28.619 align:start position:0%
there are times when it works but the
 
00:53:30.890 --> 00:53:30.900 align:start position:0%
vast majority of this career changing
 
00:53:35.690 --> 00:53:35.700 align:start position:0%
type classes only work in person and you
 
00:53:37.490 --> 00:53:37.500 align:start position:0%
know there are certain places where
 
00:53:39.470 --> 00:53:39.480 align:start position:0%
technology can help you be more
 
00:53:41.690 --> 00:53:41.700 align:start position:0%
effective and whatnot but there is no
 
00:53:43.670 --> 00:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
replacement for that person in that
 
00:53:45.530 --> 00:53:45.540 align:start position:0%
classroom that is an expert on that
 
00:53:48.250 --> 00:53:48.260 align:start position:0%
topic teaching students in person and
 
00:53:52.370 --> 00:53:52.380 align:start position:0%
seriously I I I think that
 
00:53:55.190 --> 00:53:55.200 align:start position:0%
the impact on the people who need to
 
00:53:58.370 --> 00:53:58.380 align:start position:0%
change their careers and you help them
 
00:54:00.290 --> 00:54:00.300 align:start position:0%
be successful in a different field
 
00:54:02.270 --> 00:54:02.280 align:start position:0%
because those changes keeps up keep
 
00:54:04.250 --> 00:54:04.260 align:start position:0%
happening Industries restructure all the
 
00:54:06.890 --> 00:54:06.900 align:start position:0%
time being able to help people like that
 
00:54:10.069 --> 00:54:10.079 align:start position:0%
is is a huge plus to the state and we
 
00:54:11.329 --> 00:54:11.339 align:start position:0%
really need to make sure those
 
00:54:14.089 --> 00:54:14.099 align:start position:0%
capabilities remain there thank you
 
00:54:15.950 --> 00:54:15.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:54:17.630 --> 00:54:17.640 align:start position:0%
lifelong learning it seems community
 
00:54:19.730 --> 00:54:19.740 align:start position:0%
colleges there was a strong connection
 
00:54:21.530 --> 00:54:21.540 align:start position:0%
with lifelong learning and the community
 
00:54:23.630 --> 00:54:23.640 align:start position:0%
college system and with all the
 
00:54:25.190 --> 00:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
challenges that you're facing and the
 
00:54:26.450 --> 00:54:26.460 align:start position:0%
workforce issues that you're Chase
 
00:54:26.460 --> 00:54:27.829 align:start position:0%
workforce issues that you're Chase
facing

00:54:27.829 --> 00:54:27.839 align:start position:0%
facing
 
00:54:30.349 --> 00:54:30.359 align:start position:0%
it seems community colleges have moved a
 
00:54:32.150 --> 00:54:32.160 align:start position:0%
little bit away from that which I think
 
00:54:33.890 --> 00:54:33.900 align:start position:0%
you know it's to a benefit of the state
 
00:54:36.829 --> 00:54:36.839 align:start position:0%
with regards to Workforce uh perhaps but
 
00:54:38.510 --> 00:54:38.520 align:start position:0%
can you speak a little bit to what you
 
00:54:40.069 --> 00:54:40.079 align:start position:0%
offer in the traditional lifelong
 
00:54:40.079 --> 00:54:41.270 align:start position:0%
offer in the traditional lifelong
learning

00:54:41.270 --> 00:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
learning
 
00:54:42.890 --> 00:54:42.900 align:start position:0%
path or
 
00:54:45.230 --> 00:54:45.240 align:start position:0%
so that representative Petrie can take a
 
00:54:48.230 --> 00:54:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:49.250 align:start position:0%
 
well

00:54:49.250 --> 00:54:49.260 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:54:52.250 --> 00:54:52.260 align:start position:0%
again a lot of that is in non-credit
 
00:54:54.049 --> 00:54:54.059 align:start position:0%
space and it then it does tend to be
 
00:54:58.130 --> 00:54:58.140 align:start position:0%
career focused but we we continue to
 
00:55:00.049 --> 00:55:00.059 align:start position:0%
offer a broad spectrum of curriculum for
 
00:55:01.970 --> 00:55:01.980 align:start position:0%
people who simply want to be engaged and
 
00:55:04.130 --> 00:55:04.140 align:start position:0%
we make it affordable and accessible in
 
00:55:07.370 --> 00:55:07.380 align:start position:0%
physical locations around the state
 
00:55:11.089 --> 00:55:11.099 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure I can offer you uh a
 
00:55:18.410 --> 00:55:18.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:21.710 --> 00:55:21.720 align:start position:0%
uh so I want to go back to the child uh
 
00:55:24.710 --> 00:55:24.720 align:start position:0%
care Workforce
 
00:55:26.990 --> 00:55:27.000 align:start position:0%
um developmental discussion that we had
 
00:55:29.329 --> 00:55:29.339 align:start position:0%
I guess that was last week or a little
 
00:55:30.530 --> 00:55:30.540 align:start position:0%
longer ago
 
00:55:33.710 --> 00:55:33.720 align:start position:0%
um so I remember I recall that you had
 
00:55:36.650 --> 00:55:36.660 align:start position:0%
um spoken about the you know complex
 
00:55:39.230 --> 00:55:39.240 align:start position:0%
complexity and um
 
00:55:41.650 --> 00:55:41.660 align:start position:0%
like multi-step
 
00:55:44.809 --> 00:55:44.819 align:start position:0%
tuition program or educational program
 
00:55:47.809 --> 00:55:47.819 align:start position:0%
for early childhood development and I
 
00:55:48.890 --> 00:55:48.900 align:start position:0%
remember you saying one of the
 
00:55:51.530 --> 00:55:51.540 align:start position:0%
challenges was that you know students
 
00:55:54.109 --> 00:55:54.119 align:start position:0%
who start that pipeline may find it
 
00:55:56.270 --> 00:55:56.280 align:start position:0%
difficult to finish the pipeline because
 
00:55:59.089 --> 00:55:59.099 align:start position:0%
of the increased coursework and those
 
00:55:59.099 --> 00:56:00.650 align:start position:0%
of the increased coursework and those
costs

00:56:00.650 --> 00:56:00.660 align:start position:0%
costs
 
00:56:00.660 --> 00:56:02.030 align:start position:0%
costs
um

00:56:02.030 --> 00:56:02.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:05.329 --> 00:56:05.339 align:start position:0%
if that is my correct to my memory
 
00:56:07.549 --> 00:56:07.559 align:start position:0%
um could you speak about what this new
 
00:56:10.370 --> 00:56:10.380 align:start position:0%
you know budget proposal will be doing
 
00:56:11.809 --> 00:56:11.819 align:start position:0%
for that
 
00:56:13.190 --> 00:56:13.200 align:start position:0%
um kind of
 
00:56:15.770 --> 00:56:15.780 align:start position:0%
complex problem and what you hope to see
 
00:56:17.809 --> 00:56:17.819 align:start position:0%
from this you know increased funding
 
00:56:20.210 --> 00:56:20.220 align:start position:0%
sure we'll bring forward a more complete
 
00:56:23.809 --> 00:56:23.819 align:start position:0%
proposal funding is is approved but the
 
00:56:26.510 --> 00:56:26.520 align:start position:0%
basic concept is that right now there
 
00:56:28.370 --> 00:56:28.380 align:start position:0%
are Grant programs that cover certain
 
00:56:30.650 --> 00:56:30.660 align:start position:0%
parts of the program certain courses but
 
00:56:32.510 --> 00:56:32.520 align:start position:0%
not all of the courses
 
00:56:35.510 --> 00:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
and they also have a significant work
 
00:56:37.430 --> 00:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
requirement that goes with it and those
 
00:56:39.530 --> 00:56:39.540 align:start position:0%
two things together seem to be
 
00:56:41.510 --> 00:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
impediments to students actually being
 
00:56:43.910 --> 00:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
able to complete the program so the
 
00:56:46.250 --> 00:56:46.260 align:start position:0%
additional funding fills in some of the
 
00:56:48.109 --> 00:56:48.119 align:start position:0%
funding gaps and also would allow
 
00:56:50.150 --> 00:56:50.160 align:start position:0%
students to back off of some of the
 
00:56:52.370 --> 00:56:52.380 align:start position:0%
employment work so they could focus on
 
00:56:54.349 --> 00:56:54.359 align:start position:0%
the School portion of it to complete the
 
00:56:56.990 --> 00:56:57.000 align:start position:0%
degree so it's not not devoid of the
 
00:57:00.130 --> 00:57:00.140 align:start position:0%
experiential learning or the Hands-On
 
00:57:03.049 --> 00:57:03.059 align:start position:0%
component but it creates I think a
 
00:57:05.030 --> 00:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
better balance and more seamless we
 
00:57:07.250 --> 00:57:07.260 align:start position:0%
administratively can handle the back end
 
00:57:08.809 --> 00:57:08.819 align:start position:0%
of ensuring that the student makes
 
00:57:10.549 --> 00:57:10.559 align:start position:0%
progress rather than the student having
 
00:57:12.230 --> 00:57:12.240 align:start position:0%
to figure out which courses are covered
 
00:57:13.609 --> 00:57:13.619 align:start position:0%
how they're going to fund the other
 
00:57:17.770 --> 00:57:17.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:17.780 --> 00:57:19.309 align:start position:0%
 
Mr

00:57:19.309 --> 00:57:19.319 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
00:57:20.690 --> 00:57:20.700 align:start position:0%
um chair could I just
 
00:57:22.309 --> 00:57:22.319 align:start position:0%
finish that thought with a would you
 
00:57:23.450 --> 00:57:23.460 align:start position:0%
believe I think that's going to be
 
00:57:25.670 --> 00:57:25.680 align:start position:0%
really helpful for trying to you know
 
00:57:28.250 --> 00:57:28.260 align:start position:0%
chip away at our child care
 
00:57:29.870 --> 00:57:29.880 align:start position:0%
um crisis here in the state of New
 
00:57:31.849 --> 00:57:31.859 align:start position:0%
Hampshire by providing a little more
 
00:57:34.010 --> 00:57:34.020 align:start position:0%
help for students to get through that
 
00:57:37.069 --> 00:57:37.079 align:start position:0%
tuition room if that was a statement
 
00:57:39.349 --> 00:57:39.359 align:start position:0%
then I agree if that was a question I'd
 
00:57:42.109 --> 00:57:42.119 align:start position:0%
be happy to respond
 
00:57:45.349 --> 00:57:45.359 align:start position:0%
I agree uh thank you just a quick
 
00:57:47.809 --> 00:57:47.819 align:start position:0%
question um we have a growing number of
 
00:57:50.390 --> 00:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
children with disabilities and a
 
00:57:53.089 --> 00:57:53.099 align:start position:0%
specifically autism
 
00:57:53.099 --> 00:57:54.470 align:start position:0%
specifically autism
um

00:57:54.470 --> 00:57:54.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:56.750 --> 00:57:56.760 align:start position:0%
the community colleges are a great
 
00:57:59.089 --> 00:57:59.099 align:start position:0%
opportunity for many of those students
 
00:58:01.609 --> 00:58:01.619 align:start position:0%
do you have support systems in place
 
00:58:05.630 --> 00:58:05.640 align:start position:0%
because academically many children with
 
00:58:09.230 --> 00:58:09.240 align:start position:0%
autism can achieve at high levels but
 
00:58:09.240 --> 00:58:10.250 align:start position:0%
autism can achieve at high levels but
they

00:58:10.250 --> 00:58:10.260 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:58:13.370 --> 00:58:13.380 align:start position:0%
they need some social supports what's
 
00:58:15.770 --> 00:58:15.780 align:start position:0%
available for a student with a
 
00:58:18.890 --> 00:58:18.900 align:start position:0%
disability at the community college each
 
00:58:21.049 --> 00:58:21.059 align:start position:0%
each campus has a coordinator
 
00:58:23.270 --> 00:58:23.280 align:start position:0%
responsible for identifying
 
00:58:25.130 --> 00:58:25.140 align:start position:0%
accommodations for students with
 
00:58:26.870 --> 00:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate documentation as you
 
00:58:28.430 --> 00:58:28.440 align:start position:0%
probably know there's difference between
 
00:58:30.710 --> 00:58:30.720 align:start position:0%
post-secondary and K through 12 and the
 
00:58:32.329 --> 00:58:32.339 align:start position:0%
onus is on the student to bring forth
 
00:58:34.010 --> 00:58:34.020 align:start position:0%
the documentation
 
00:58:37.430 --> 00:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
we are in some cases working with campus
 
00:58:40.789 --> 00:58:40.799 align:start position:0%
resources in some cases Voc Rehab to put
 
00:58:43.370 --> 00:58:43.380 align:start position:0%
together supports for the student but
 
00:58:45.890 --> 00:58:45.900 align:start position:0%
again it's Case by case and I I agree
 
00:58:47.630 --> 00:58:47.640 align:start position:0%
with your observation a lot of the
 
00:58:49.549 --> 00:58:49.559 align:start position:0%
students run into barriers that keep
 
00:58:51.230 --> 00:58:51.240 align:start position:0%
them from reaching our doors we'd like
 
00:58:55.609 --> 00:58:55.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:58.270 --> 00:58:58.280 align:start position:0%
thank you uh to follow up on
 
00:59:00.650 --> 00:59:00.660 align:start position:0%
representative Heath
 
00:59:02.990 --> 00:59:03.000 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure if you familiar with the
 
00:59:05.270 --> 00:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
Met program it's it's a mentoring
 
00:59:09.650 --> 00:59:09.660 align:start position:0%
program in it and I was I went to a CSG
 
00:59:14.089 --> 00:59:14.099 align:start position:0%
uh Summit uh down in Rhode Island and
 
00:59:16.609 --> 00:59:16.619 align:start position:0%
they had a mentoring program where you
 
00:59:19.789 --> 00:59:19.799 align:start position:0%
like this this one autistic uh student
 
00:59:22.370 --> 00:59:22.380 align:start position:0%
uh was following a civil engineer now
 
00:59:25.130 --> 00:59:25.140 align:start position:0%
they don't have a physical classroom
 
00:59:27.109 --> 00:59:27.119 align:start position:0%
but they it's it's almost like a
 
00:59:30.829 --> 00:59:30.839 align:start position:0%
directed study and they they formulate a
 
00:59:33.109 --> 00:59:33.119 align:start position:0%
plan and I mean this kid was awesome I
 
00:59:35.630 --> 00:59:35.640 align:start position:0%
mean he really you know he he gave the
 
00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
keynote speech you know to the group and
 
00:59:39.829 --> 00:59:39.839 align:start position:0%
I mean any a
 
00:59:42.950 --> 00:59:42.960 align:start position:0%
National president was here a aft was
 
00:59:45.710 --> 00:59:45.720 align:start position:0%
there uh and I mean it uh
 
00:59:48.289 --> 00:59:48.299 align:start position:0%
it would be nice if we could come up and
 
00:59:49.609 --> 00:59:49.619 align:start position:0%
actually the
 
00:59:52.069 --> 00:59:52.079 align:start position:0%
uh teacher that came up with this
 
00:59:52.079 --> 00:59:53.030 align:start position:0%
uh teacher that came up with this
program

00:59:53.030 --> 00:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:59:56.630 --> 00:59:56.640 align:start position:0%
uh he was actually a teacher in
 
00:59:59.990 --> 01:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
Winchester and you know and but he he
 
01:00:02.750 --> 01:00:02.760 align:start position:0%
devised it and it's now in 68
 
01:00:05.809 --> 01:00:05.819 align:start position:0%
they have 68 schools around the world to
 
01:00:09.530 --> 01:00:09.540 align:start position:0%
do this but the mentoring side is what
 
01:00:10.849 --> 01:00:10.859 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you could come up with
 
01:00:12.109 --> 01:00:12.119 align:start position:0%
something like that or do you have
 
01:00:15.349 --> 01:00:15.359 align:start position:0%
something like that thank you
 
01:00:18.890 --> 01:00:18.900 align:start position:0%
nothing specific I can respond to sir
 
01:00:21.109 --> 01:00:21.119 align:start position:0%
I just had a follow-up question on the
 
01:00:23.030 --> 01:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
point brought that by representative
 
01:00:26.270 --> 01:00:26.280 align:start position:0%
Heath on uh you know kids with adults
 
01:00:29.030 --> 01:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
young adults with disabilities I would
 
01:00:31.250 --> 01:00:31.260 align:start position:0%
assume but I want to double check that
 
01:00:33.289 --> 01:00:33.299 align:start position:0%
part of the services you offer them is
 
01:00:35.630 --> 01:00:35.640 align:start position:0%
to try to help them find the fields
 
01:00:37.490 --> 01:00:37.500 align:start position:0%
where their limitations would not
 
01:00:39.170 --> 01:00:39.180 align:start position:0%
prevent them from achieving their
 
01:00:41.569 --> 01:00:41.579 align:start position:0%
potential because I can think of
 
01:00:44.210 --> 01:00:44.220 align:start position:0%
specifics in the specific types of
 
01:00:46.910 --> 01:00:46.920 align:start position:0%
conditions that would definitely be a
 
01:00:48.770 --> 01:00:48.780 align:start position:0%
huge impediment into one career but
 
01:00:51.470 --> 01:00:51.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be an impediment in one so are
 
01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
you you know do they have access to the
 
01:00:55.490 --> 01:00:55.500 align:start position:0%
you know kind of counseling and support
 
01:00:58.309 --> 01:00:58.319 align:start position:0%
to find the right match because they
 
01:01:00.410 --> 01:01:00.420 align:start position:0%
need more support than you know people
 
01:01:02.990 --> 01:01:03.000 align:start position:0%
who are not challenged that way yeah I
 
01:01:06.170 --> 01:01:06.180 align:start position:0%
we we have advisors to assist students
 
01:01:08.150 --> 01:01:08.160 align:start position:0%
but I don't want to suggest that we've
 
01:01:10.309 --> 01:01:10.319 align:start position:0%
got folks who's you know that that's
 
01:01:12.650 --> 01:01:12.660 align:start position:0%
their exclusive focus and to a large
 
01:01:15.829 --> 01:01:15.839 align:start position:0%
extent as the students find their way to
 
01:01:17.990 --> 01:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
us with somebody helping having helped
 
01:01:21.349 --> 01:01:21.359 align:start position:0%
them find the path to us where we can
 
01:01:23.089 --> 01:01:23.099 align:start position:0%
then deliver the program
 
01:01:24.829 --> 01:01:24.839 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:01:27.049 --> 01:01:27.059 align:start position:0%
well thank you for your presentation and
 
01:01:29.990 --> 01:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
we look forward to hb2
 
01:01:32.390 --> 01:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
being translated so we don't know what's
 
01:01:35.270 --> 01:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
going on uh to see what what additional
 
01:01:38.210 --> 01:01:38.220 align:start position:0%
it might be in there as do we thank you
 
01:01:41.150 --> 01:01:41.160 align:start position:0%
sir thank you all
 
01:01:44.930 --> 01:01:44.940 align:start position:0%
okay we've got about two minutes
 
01:01:51.770 --> 01:01:51.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:00.530 --> 01:02:00.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:07.809 --> 01:02:07.819 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:01.190 --> 01:05:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:03.410 --> 01:05:03.420 align:start position:0%
that makes other texts more expensive
 
01:05:05.809 --> 01:05:05.819 align:start position:0%
okay in order to be on schedule we need
 
01:05:08.630 --> 01:05:08.640 align:start position:0%
to get underway we welcome
 
01:05:13.130 --> 01:05:13.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:19.010 --> 01:05:19.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:20.760 align:start position:0%
and I'll turn the I'll turn the floor
 
01:05:24.530 --> 01:05:24.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:26.030 --> 01:05:26.040 align:start position:0%
red just

red just
John

University system
 
01:05:49.309 --> 01:05:49.319 align:start position:0%
and good morning everyone I'm Jim Dean
 
01:05:50.930 --> 01:05:50.940 align:start position:0%
I'm the president of the University of
 
01:05:53.510 --> 01:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and interim Chancellor for
 
01:05:55.789 --> 01:05:55.799 align:start position:0%
the usnh system
 
01:06:03.130 --> 01:06:03.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:08.089 --> 01:06:08.099 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:10.309 --> 01:06:10.319 align:start position:0%
oh well no that's that's a much longer
 
01:06:11.770 --> 01:06:11.780 align:start position:0%
story sir
 
01:06:14.329 --> 01:06:14.339 align:start position:0%
I'm not in a room as president only as
 
01:06:16.190 --> 01:06:16.200 align:start position:0%
uh as Chancellor
 
01:06:18.530 --> 01:06:18.540 align:start position:0%
so we have some materials that we've
 
01:06:20.270 --> 01:06:20.280 align:start position:0%
handed out to you so you'll have some
 
01:06:22.849 --> 01:06:22.859 align:start position:0%
leave behind and a sense of what it is
 
01:06:25.370 --> 01:06:25.380 align:start position:0%
that we're here to talk about
 
01:06:29.150 --> 01:06:29.160 align:start position:0%
so starting on page two of Our Deck one
 
01:06:31.069 --> 01:06:31.079 align:start position:0%
of the things that we wanted to let you
 
01:06:34.010 --> 01:06:34.020 align:start position:0%
know about is that the system the
 
01:06:36.289 --> 01:06:36.299 align:start position:0%
university system of New Hampshire has
 
01:06:38.390 --> 01:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
not increased tuition for in-state
 
01:06:40.190 --> 01:06:40.200 align:start position:0%
students for five years we've held
 
01:06:42.950 --> 01:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
tuition flat for five years and of
 
01:06:45.410 --> 01:06:45.420 align:start position:0%
course what that means with inflation is
 
01:06:47.329 --> 01:06:47.339 align:start position:0%
that we've actually decreased tuition in
 
01:06:49.250 --> 01:06:49.260 align:start position:0%
real terms it's something we're really
 
01:06:51.349 --> 01:06:51.359 align:start position:0%
proud of because we think as a public
 
01:06:54.529 --> 01:06:54.539 align:start position:0%
university system we need to be really
 
01:06:57.470 --> 01:06:57.480 align:start position:0%
cognizant of the needs especially of the
 
01:06:59.930 --> 01:06:59.940 align:start position:0%
students who are not affluent or middle
 
01:07:02.029 --> 01:07:02.039 align:start position:0%
class students and we believe that
 
01:07:04.789 --> 01:07:04.799 align:start position:0%
holding tuition flat for five years has
 
01:07:07.190 --> 01:07:07.200 align:start position:0%
really made it more affordable for them
 
01:07:09.770 --> 01:07:09.780 align:start position:0%
to to stay in New Hampshire and to get
 
01:07:11.809 --> 01:07:11.819 align:start position:0%
their education
 
01:07:15.829 --> 01:07:15.839 align:start position:0%
the way that yes go please go ahead
 
01:07:18.770 --> 01:07:18.780 align:start position:0%
thank you uh will will the increase in
 
01:07:20.329 --> 01:07:20.339 align:start position:0%
Pell Grants well how much will that help
 
01:07:20.339 --> 01:07:23.029 align:start position:0%
Pell Grants well how much will that help
you

01:07:23.029 --> 01:07:23.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:25.490 --> 01:07:25.500 align:start position:0%
to increase that the federal
 
01:07:27.829 --> 01:07:27.839 align:start position:0%
government's talking about correct that
 
01:07:29.990 --> 01:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
that will significantly help tell me how
 
01:07:32.210 --> 01:07:32.220 align:start position:0%
much do you have a number or have you
 
01:07:35.630 --> 01:07:35.640 align:start position:0%
thought about it uh overall
 
01:07:37.309 --> 01:07:37.319 align:start position:0%
no I'll have to get back to you on that
 
01:07:40.250 --> 01:07:40.260 align:start position:0%
but yet we have we have done
 
01:07:41.930 --> 01:07:41.940 align:start position:0%
um analysis I just don't have it with me
 
01:07:41.940 --> 01:07:43.490 align:start position:0%
um analysis I just don't have it with me
representative

01:07:43.490 --> 01:07:43.500 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:07:45.410 --> 01:07:45.420 align:start position:0%
um but yes that would significantly help
 
01:07:49.970 --> 01:07:49.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:49.980 --> 01:07:56.650 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:07:56.650 --> 01:07:56.660 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:58.789 --> 01:07:58.799 align:start position:0%
okay that's fine
 
01:08:01.549 --> 01:08:01.559 align:start position:0%
um so on page three uh the way that
 
01:08:04.010 --> 01:08:04.020 align:start position:0%
we've been able to keep tuition flat
 
01:08:06.349 --> 01:08:06.359 align:start position:0%
over that period of time is through some
 
01:08:08.329 --> 01:08:08.339 align:start position:0%
pretty significant reduction in expenses
 
01:08:11.029 --> 01:08:11.039 align:start position:0%
as you can see on page three uh 50
 
01:08:12.650 --> 01:08:12.660 align:start position:0%
million dollars in total operating
 
01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
expenses between fiscal 19 and fiscal 22
 
01:08:18.669 --> 01:08:18.679 align:start position:0%
coming both from employee compensation
 
01:08:22.189 --> 01:08:22.199 align:start position:0%
and from other operating expenses and
 
01:08:24.470 --> 01:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
the reason we raise this is that we're
 
01:08:25.849 --> 01:08:25.859 align:start position:0%
coming to the state asking for
 
01:08:28.490 --> 01:08:28.500 align:start position:0%
additional funding and I think you would
 
01:08:30.110 --> 01:08:30.120 align:start position:0%
be well within your rights to say well
 
01:08:31.610 --> 01:08:31.620 align:start position:0%
how have you handled the money that
 
01:08:34.130 --> 01:08:34.140 align:start position:0%
you've already gotten and are you acting
 
01:08:36.530 --> 01:08:36.540 align:start position:0%
responsibly with respect to that and I
 
01:08:39.289 --> 01:08:39.299 align:start position:0%
think it's clear that we are when I came
 
01:08:42.169 --> 01:08:42.179 align:start position:0%
in as president of unh and then
 
01:08:44.209 --> 01:08:44.219 align:start position:0%
collaborating with Kathy and the other
 
01:08:46.669 --> 01:08:46.679 align:start position:0%
presidents across the system we took a
 
01:08:48.289 --> 01:08:48.299 align:start position:0%
really hard look at our expenses and
 
01:08:49.849 --> 01:08:49.859 align:start position:0%
said are there ways that we can operate
 
01:08:52.910 --> 01:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
more effectively and we've actually done
 
01:08:55.189 --> 01:08:55.199 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of cutting not by just
 
01:08:58.189 --> 01:08:58.199 align:start position:0%
saying 5 percent here or 10 there but
 
01:09:00.410 --> 01:09:00.420 align:start position:0%
looking at how we do things including
 
01:09:02.749 --> 01:09:02.759 align:start position:0%
some consolidation of services for
 
01:09:04.490 --> 01:09:04.500 align:start position:0%
example across the universities that we
 
01:09:06.289 --> 01:09:06.299 align:start position:0%
had not really done before so we're very
 
01:09:08.329 --> 01:09:08.339 align:start position:0%
proud of the reduction in costs that
 
01:09:09.950 --> 01:09:09.960 align:start position:0%
we've been able to get over the past few
 
01:09:10.789 --> 01:09:10.799 align:start position:0%
years I think they're really
 
01:09:10.799 --> 01:09:13.970 align:start position:0%
years I think they're really
unprecedented

01:09:13.970 --> 01:09:13.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:15.890 --> 01:09:15.900 align:start position:0%
and as you can see at the bottom of page
 
01:09:18.829 --> 01:09:18.839 align:start position:0%
three uh
 
01:09:21.829 --> 01:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
we're spending
 
01:09:23.990 --> 01:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
less than the average New England
 
01:09:27.050 --> 01:09:27.060 align:start position:0%
institution on students so we we do that
 
01:09:28.430 --> 01:09:28.440 align:start position:0%
kind of benchmarking to make sure that
 
01:09:30.169 --> 01:09:30.179 align:start position:0%
we're staying competitive on on
 
01:09:31.970 --> 01:09:31.980 align:start position:0%
operational expenses operational
 
01:09:35.510 --> 01:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:38.450 --> 01:09:38.460 align:start position:0%
then as you go to page four stating I'm
 
01:09:39.769 --> 01:09:39.779 align:start position:0%
sure the obvious but we thought we
 
01:09:41.809 --> 01:09:41.819 align:start position:0%
should probably put that in there that
 
01:09:43.910 --> 01:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
that we are of course experiencing
 
01:09:46.910 --> 01:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
inflation uh and that we have been able
 
01:09:49.970 --> 01:09:49.980 align:start position:0%
to reduce expensive uh expenses hold
 
01:09:52.370 --> 01:09:52.380 align:start position:0%
tuition flat and to increase financial
 
01:09:54.650 --> 01:09:54.660 align:start position:0%
aid over that period of time despite
 
01:09:57.050 --> 01:09:57.060 align:start position:0%
inflation a 15 million dollar plus
 
01:10:02.229 --> 01:10:02.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:04.669 --> 01:10:04.679 align:start position:0%
what we're really about in the
 
01:10:07.850 --> 01:10:07.860 align:start position:0%
University system is providing people
 
01:10:10.729 --> 01:10:10.739 align:start position:0%
for the workforce of New Hampshire that
 
01:10:12.530 --> 01:10:12.540 align:start position:0%
is really the central mission that we
 
01:10:12.540 --> 01:10:13.610 align:start position:0%
is really the central mission that we
have

01:10:13.610 --> 01:10:13.620 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:10:13.620 --> 01:10:14.570 align:start position:0%
have
um

01:10:14.570 --> 01:10:14.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:16.790 --> 01:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
I would be preaching to the converted to
 
01:10:18.890 --> 01:10:18.900 align:start position:0%
tell you that there's a tremendous need
 
01:10:21.110 --> 01:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
for Workforce in New Hampshire with
 
01:10:23.209 --> 01:10:23.219 align:start position:0%
every level of Education up to and
 
01:10:25.270 --> 01:10:25.280 align:start position:0%
including a university level degrees
 
01:10:28.370 --> 01:10:28.380 align:start position:0%
just as an example there on page five is
 
01:10:30.709 --> 01:10:30.719 align:start position:0%
a figure of graduates from the
 
01:10:31.850 --> 01:10:31.860 align:start position:0%
University system of New Hampshire
 
01:10:35.090 --> 01:10:35.100 align:start position:0%
working in New Hampshire in 2021 so
 
01:10:37.910 --> 01:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
nearly 20 000 people there we're
 
01:10:39.950 --> 01:10:39.960 align:start position:0%
collaborating collaborating excuse me
 
01:10:43.550 --> 01:10:43.560 align:start position:0%
with over 2 000 Partners within the
 
01:10:45.590 --> 01:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
state in terms of helping our students
 
01:10:48.649 --> 01:10:48.659 align:start position:0%
to do internships and to be hired by the
 
01:10:51.290 --> 01:10:51.300 align:start position:0%
employers of New Hampshire and this last
 
01:10:53.750 --> 01:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
point on here that the 2X
 
01:10:55.370 --> 01:10:55.380 align:start position:0%
uh and we'll probably say a little bit
 
01:10:57.770 --> 01:10:57.780 align:start position:0%
more about this later we bring a lot of
 
01:10:59.870 --> 01:10:59.880 align:start position:0%
people in from out of state to educate
 
01:11:02.270 --> 01:11:02.280 align:start position:0%
and many of them will stay we probably
 
01:11:04.310 --> 01:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
are more responsible for bringing more
 
01:11:06.050 --> 01:11:06.060 align:start position:0%
people in from out of state into the
 
01:11:07.610 --> 01:11:07.620 align:start position:0%
economy of New Hampshire than anyone
 
01:11:10.490 --> 01:11:10.500 align:start position:0%
else is and if we can get them to
 
01:11:12.050 --> 01:11:12.060 align:start position:0%
complete an internship in New Hampshire
 
01:11:14.630 --> 01:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
they're twice as likely to stay which is
 
01:11:17.090 --> 01:11:17.100 align:start position:0%
what we absolutely want them to do and
 
01:11:19.250 --> 01:11:19.260 align:start position:0%
for that reason we enjoy a tremendous
 
01:11:20.510 --> 01:11:20.520 align:start position:0%
amount of sport from the business
 
01:11:22.610 --> 01:11:22.620 align:start position:0%
Community specifically the business and
 
01:11:24.950 --> 01:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
industry Association which is very much
 
01:11:26.270 --> 01:11:26.280 align:start position:0%
and I think we've got a slide in here
 
01:11:28.070 --> 01:11:28.080 align:start position:0%
very much in support of increased
 
01:11:31.250 --> 01:11:31.260 align:start position:0%
funding so I think sometimes in the past
 
01:11:33.770 --> 01:11:33.780 align:start position:0%
we haven't really told that story that
 
01:11:35.390 --> 01:11:35.400 align:start position:0%
we're bringing people from all over the
 
01:11:36.770 --> 01:11:36.780 align:start position:0%
country into the economy of New
 
01:11:37.970 --> 01:11:37.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and we're trying to find a way
 
01:11:40.010 --> 01:11:40.020 align:start position:0%
to help them to stay and become part of
 
01:11:43.070 --> 01:11:43.080 align:start position:0%
our economy and part of our Workforce
 
01:11:46.970 --> 01:11:46.980 align:start position:0%
can I just one um I just want to back up
 
01:11:49.669 --> 01:11:49.679 align:start position:0%
on that number Jim mentioned 20 000 new
 
01:11:51.470 --> 01:11:51.480 align:start position:0%
um usnh graduates
 
01:11:53.870 --> 01:11:53.880 align:start position:0%
that's only graduates who who were from
 
01:11:57.110 --> 01:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
2012 to 2020 because we're sharing
 
01:11:59.090 --> 01:11:59.100 align:start position:0%
information with the Department of
 
01:12:02.050 --> 01:12:02.060 align:start position:0%
Employment Security so the number is
 
01:12:04.490 --> 01:12:04.500 align:start position:0%
significantly larger than that right
 
01:12:07.250 --> 01:12:07.260 align:start position:0%
it's just starting in 2012.
 
01:12:07.260 --> 01:12:08.930 align:start position:0%
it's just starting in 2012.
right

01:12:08.930 --> 01:12:08.940 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:12:11.149 --> 01:12:11.159 align:start position:0%
it's a very quick follow-up on the same
 
01:12:14.390 --> 01:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
exact topic it's about 20 High 2100
 
01:12:17.570 --> 01:12:17.580 align:start position:0%
graduates a year that comes here what's
 
01:12:19.250 --> 01:12:19.260 align:start position:0%
your average class size
 
01:12:21.050 --> 01:12:21.060 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to figure out the percentage
 
01:12:23.990 --> 01:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
not just the total number
 
01:12:27.350 --> 01:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
University system it's a
 
01:12:31.070 --> 01:12:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:36.110 --> 01:12:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:39.649 --> 01:12:39.659 align:start position:0%
so moving on then to page six uh we
 
01:12:41.510 --> 01:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
believe that we're doing a really some
 
01:12:43.070 --> 01:12:43.080 align:start position:0%
really important work supporting the
 
01:12:44.930 --> 01:12:44.940 align:start position:0%
economy and providing the professional
 
01:12:47.750 --> 01:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
Workforce for the state and we've been
 
01:12:49.850 --> 01:12:49.860 align:start position:0%
doing a lot as I said we've we've made
 
01:12:51.890 --> 01:12:51.900 align:start position:0%
tremendous strides in reducing expenses
 
01:12:54.290 --> 01:12:54.300 align:start position:0%
both on the Personnel side and on the
 
01:12:55.729 --> 01:12:55.739 align:start position:0%
non-personnel side
 
01:12:57.530 --> 01:12:57.540 align:start position:0%
but we're not sure that we can continue
 
01:12:59.570 --> 01:12:59.580 align:start position:0%
to do it much longer without additional
 
01:13:01.310 --> 01:13:01.320 align:start position:0%
funding it's getting harder and harder
 
01:13:04.550 --> 01:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
to do that uh harder to keep tuition
 
01:13:07.189 --> 01:13:07.199 align:start position:0%
down uh harder to have the resources to
 
01:13:09.770 --> 01:13:09.780 align:start position:0%
work with employers and so we have
 
01:13:11.630 --> 01:13:11.640 align:start position:0%
avoided coming to you asking for
 
01:13:13.130 --> 01:13:13.140 align:start position:0%
additional funding but we think we've
 
01:13:15.110 --> 01:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
done about everything we can to reduce
 
01:13:17.090 --> 01:13:17.100 align:start position:0%
our costs over the past few years we'll
 
01:13:18.890 --> 01:13:18.900 align:start position:0%
continue to work on that we still have
 
01:13:20.870 --> 01:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
tasks for us doing that but we've taken
 
01:13:22.910 --> 01:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
an awful lot of costs out of the
 
01:13:24.470 --> 01:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
University system over the past few
 
01:13:26.390 --> 01:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
years and I feel really good about that
 
01:13:28.430 --> 01:13:28.440 align:start position:0%
and really really proud about that but
 
01:13:30.110 --> 01:13:30.120 align:start position:0%
we really need your help now to be able
 
01:13:32.209 --> 01:13:32.219 align:start position:0%
to continue to fulfill that mission of
 
01:13:33.709 --> 01:13:33.719 align:start position:0%
graduating students to help the New
 
01:13:36.590 --> 01:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:38.570 --> 01:13:38.580 align:start position:0%
as I've said and now moving to page
 
01:13:38.580 --> 01:13:39.709 align:start position:0%
as I've said and now moving to page
seven

01:13:39.709 --> 01:13:39.719 align:start position:0%
seven
 
01:13:41.810 --> 01:13:41.820 align:start position:0%
um we're really happy to have the
 
01:13:43.790 --> 01:13:43.800 align:start position:0%
support of the business Community uh
 
01:13:45.890 --> 01:13:45.900 align:start position:0%
Kathy and others just organized an event
 
01:13:47.990 --> 01:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
a couple of weeks ago where we had
 
01:13:49.430 --> 01:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
Business Leaders from around the state
 
01:13:52.130 --> 01:13:52.140 align:start position:0%
come and and talk in support of the
 
01:13:53.930 --> 01:13:53.940 align:start position:0%
University system and what we're doing
 
01:13:56.870 --> 01:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
to try and provide employment I joined
 
01:13:58.490 --> 01:13:58.500 align:start position:0%
the board of the business and industry
 
01:14:00.890 --> 01:14:00.900 align:start position:0%
Association because of my background as
 
01:14:02.689 --> 01:14:02.699 align:start position:0%
a business school dean those are sort of
 
01:14:04.370 --> 01:14:04.380 align:start position:0%
my people so I feel really comfortable
 
01:14:07.729 --> 01:14:07.739 align:start position:0%
in that and we're trying to find ways to
 
01:14:09.649 --> 01:14:09.659 align:start position:0%
for the University system to be
 
01:14:11.870 --> 01:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
friendlier to the businesses in New
 
01:14:12.950 --> 01:14:12.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I think we've made a lot
 
01:14:14.630 --> 01:14:14.640 align:start position:0%
of progress with that I've also formed
 
01:14:17.689 --> 01:14:17.699 align:start position:0%
my own business advisory council at UNH
 
01:14:21.169 --> 01:14:21.179 align:start position:0%
so that I have the business Community
 
01:14:23.330 --> 01:14:23.340 align:start position:0%
within New Hampshire has my year and the
 
01:14:25.370 --> 01:14:25.380 align:start position:0%
year of the people at UNH we think it's
 
01:14:27.350 --> 01:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
really Central because those are the
 
01:14:29.270 --> 01:14:29.280 align:start position:0%
people that are doing the hiring and
 
01:14:31.310 --> 01:14:31.320 align:start position:0%
moving the unit moving the workforce
 
01:14:33.229 --> 01:14:33.239 align:start position:0%
forward so we're really grateful for the
 
01:14:35.330 --> 01:14:35.340 align:start position:0%
support of the business and industry
 
01:14:35.340 --> 01:14:39.229 align:start position:0%
support of the business and industry
Association

01:14:39.229 --> 01:14:39.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:42.470 --> 01:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
moving to page eight this is really to
 
01:14:45.530 --> 01:14:45.540 align:start position:0%
put our request in context so you see
 
01:14:48.290 --> 01:14:48.300 align:start position:0%
the level of appreciations going back to
 
01:14:51.830 --> 01:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2010 and out through fiscal
 
01:14:54.890 --> 01:14:54.900 align:start position:0%
year 2025.
 
01:14:57.110 --> 01:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
what I'm what we're trying to convey
 
01:14:58.610 --> 01:14:58.620 align:start position:0%
with this slide is we don't think that
 
01:15:01.010 --> 01:15:01.020 align:start position:0%
this is an outrageous uh kind of a
 
01:15:03.290 --> 01:15:03.300 align:start position:0%
request what we're really asking is to
 
01:15:05.090 --> 01:15:05.100 align:start position:0%
get back to the level of funding that we
 
01:15:08.090 --> 01:15:08.100 align:start position:0%
had in 2011.
 
01:15:09.890 --> 01:15:09.900 align:start position:0%
um and you can see that there was a 50
 
01:15:13.790 --> 01:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
cut in our funding in 2011. uh if we
 
01:15:16.310 --> 01:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
were able to to get the funding that we
 
01:15:18.169 --> 01:15:18.179 align:start position:0%
requested we will be back to and
 
01:15:19.669 --> 01:15:19.679 align:start position:0%
slightly above
 
01:15:21.709 --> 01:15:21.719 align:start position:0%
discounting inflation so forget
 
01:15:23.630 --> 01:15:23.640 align:start position:0%
inflation just in terms of current
 
01:15:26.290 --> 01:15:26.300 align:start position:0%
dollars where we were in
 
01:15:30.649 --> 01:15:30.659 align:start position:0%
2011. uh where we are now is about 11
 
01:15:32.570 --> 01:15:32.580 align:start position:0%
and a half percent lower
 
01:15:34.910 --> 01:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
in constant dollars than where we were
 
01:15:38.209 --> 01:15:38.219 align:start position:0%
in 2011. uh we believe that the state
 
01:15:38.219 --> 01:15:39.350 align:start position:0%
in 2011. uh we believe that the state
budget

01:15:39.350 --> 01:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:15:41.590 --> 01:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
and what's the term of art Kathy general
 
01:15:44.930 --> 01:15:44.940 align:start position:0%
fund the general fund has increased by
 
01:15:47.330 --> 01:15:47.340 align:start position:0%
about six percent at least over that
 
01:15:49.669 --> 01:15:49.679 align:start position:0%
period of time so there's now basically
 
01:15:52.850 --> 01:15:52.860 align:start position:0%
a 17 point gap between where we were in
 
01:15:55.669 --> 01:15:55.679 align:start position:0%
2011 and where we are now so we're not
 
01:15:58.189 --> 01:15:58.199 align:start position:0%
looking to be disproportionately funded
 
01:15:59.750 --> 01:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
we'd just like to get back to where we
 
01:16:03.830 --> 01:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:06.169 --> 01:16:06.179 align:start position:0%
and with that I'll turn to Kathy to talk
 
01:16:08.630 --> 01:16:08.640 align:start position:0%
about the next couple slides so on on
 
01:16:11.990 --> 01:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
slide nine I want to talk about what it
 
01:16:14.630 --> 01:16:14.640 align:start position:0%
is the University system is seeking with
 
01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:15.649 align:start position:0%
is the University system is seeking with
this

01:16:15.649 --> 01:16:15.659 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:16:19.010 --> 01:16:19.020 align:start position:0%
um additional funding and
 
01:16:22.669 --> 01:16:22.679 align:start position:0%
it it isn't to grow the cost structure
 
01:16:26.090 --> 01:16:26.100 align:start position:0%
or anything like that it is primarily
 
01:16:29.270 --> 01:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
targeted to Plymouth and Keen
 
01:16:31.729 --> 01:16:31.739 align:start position:0%
to provide resources for Plymouth and
 
01:16:34.370 --> 01:16:34.380 align:start position:0%
Keene to build infrastructure for those
 
01:16:36.590 --> 01:16:36.600 align:start position:0%
internships that President Dean just
 
01:16:38.510 --> 01:16:38.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned as well as other business
 
01:16:41.149 --> 01:16:41.159 align:start position:0%
Partnerships in The Lakes Region North
 
01:16:43.010 --> 01:16:43.020 align:start position:0%
Country and Monadnock region of the
 
01:16:44.570 --> 01:16:44.580 align:start position:0%
state I think I might have mentioned
 
01:16:48.050 --> 01:16:48.060 align:start position:0%
last Thursday that UNH invested
 
01:16:52.490 --> 01:16:52.500 align:start position:0%
five or six years ago in um building a
 
01:16:55.010 --> 01:16:55.020 align:start position:0%
pretty robust internship program but
 
01:16:56.689 --> 01:16:56.699 align:start position:0%
frankly Plymouth and Keene do not have
 
01:16:58.550 --> 01:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
the resources to do that and we'd like
 
01:17:00.890 --> 01:17:00.900 align:start position:0%
to partner with the state so that we can
 
01:17:03.890 --> 01:17:03.900 align:start position:0%
increase that Talent pipeline from from
 
01:17:06.590 --> 01:17:06.600 align:start position:0%
keen and Plymouth into into those
 
01:17:08.270 --> 01:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
regions of the state that that need it
 
01:17:10.189 --> 01:17:10.199 align:start position:0%
and obviously Plymouth and Keen are
 
01:17:13.430 --> 01:17:13.440 align:start position:0%
economic anchors in in their regions
 
01:17:15.590 --> 01:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
uh the other part of the additional
 
01:17:18.649 --> 01:17:18.659 align:start position:0%
funding is also targeted to Plymouth and
 
01:17:21.350 --> 01:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
Keene to help Plymouth and Keene
 
01:17:24.229 --> 01:17:24.239 align:start position:0%
maintain the level of financial aid for
 
01:17:27.530 --> 01:17:27.540 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire students that it has now
 
01:17:29.270 --> 01:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
um we have the granite guarantee where
 
01:17:31.870 --> 01:17:31.880 align:start position:0%
Pell eligible students
 
01:17:36.649 --> 01:17:36.659 align:start position:0%
attend our institutions with no tuition
 
01:17:38.870 --> 01:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
and Plymouth and Keane need that so
 
01:17:41.570 --> 01:17:41.580 align:start position:0%
support so we can continue to
 
01:17:44.870 --> 01:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
compete on price and keep our New
 
01:17:46.370 --> 01:17:46.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire students here
 
01:17:48.830 --> 01:17:48.840 align:start position:0%
and then that last piece is relative to
 
01:17:52.610 --> 01:17:52.620 align:start position:0%
Cooperative Extension in fiscal 25 that
 
01:17:54.110 --> 01:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
will bring I believe will bring
 
01:17:56.810 --> 01:17:56.820 align:start position:0%
Cooperative Extension back to its 2011
 
01:17:59.570 --> 01:17:59.580 align:start position:0%
levels Cooperative Extension has
 
01:18:03.350 --> 01:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
remarkable reach across every region of
 
01:18:07.310 --> 01:18:07.320 align:start position:0%
the Granite State and to be able to
 
01:18:07.320 --> 01:18:08.390 align:start position:0%
the Granite State and to be able to
um

01:18:08.390 --> 01:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:11.510 --> 01:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
use the research that's done at UNH to
 
01:18:13.550 --> 01:18:13.560 align:start position:0%
get that information out to Granite
 
01:18:16.729 --> 01:18:16.739 align:start position:0%
Staters is is critically important so
 
01:18:19.669 --> 01:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
that's the piece that's that's added
 
01:18:24.950 --> 01:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
um in fiscal 25. we had requested
 
01:18:27.110 --> 01:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
eight million dollars now I'm on the
 
01:18:29.630 --> 01:18:29.640 align:start position:0%
Plymouth and Keen strength and Workforce
 
01:18:31.610 --> 01:18:31.620 align:start position:0%
Partnerships we had requested eight
 
01:18:34.070 --> 01:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
million dollars in fiscal 25 and the
 
01:18:36.050 --> 01:18:36.060 align:start position:0%
governor is recommending three million
 
01:18:39.590 --> 01:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
dollars so of our total request across
 
01:18:41.930 --> 01:18:41.940 align:start position:0%
the entire biennium including the three
 
01:18:43.790 --> 01:18:43.800 align:start position:0%
percent efficiency and the additional
 
01:18:46.930 --> 01:18:46.940 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs we had requested
 
01:18:49.490 --> 01:18:49.500 align:start position:0%
199.4 million and the governor is
 
01:18:49.500 --> 01:18:50.890 align:start position:0%
199.4 million and the governor is
proposing

01:18:50.890 --> 01:18:50.900 align:start position:0%
proposing
 
01:18:54.229 --> 01:18:54.239 align:start position:0%
194.4 million so he pulled back on that
 
01:18:56.330 --> 01:18:56.340 align:start position:0%
strength and Workforce Partnerships at
 
01:19:00.110 --> 01:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:02.450 --> 01:19:02.460 align:start position:0%
and just because I know there's a lot of
 
01:19:04.010 --> 01:19:04.020 align:start position:0%
jargon in a lot of areas is everybody
 
01:19:06.169 --> 01:19:06.179 align:start position:0%
when we say Pell eligible is that
 
01:19:08.330 --> 01:19:08.340 align:start position:0%
language everyone's familiar with
 
01:19:10.070 --> 01:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
right so okay
 
01:19:12.530 --> 01:19:12.540 align:start position:0%
it's a synonym for the the poor students
 
01:19:14.930 --> 01:19:14.940 align:start position:0%
basically okay
 
01:19:19.910 --> 01:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
so moving then to to slide 10 uh one of
 
01:19:21.950 --> 01:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
the challenges we have is that so many
 
01:19:25.010 --> 01:19:25.020 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire students uh who go on to
 
01:19:26.870 --> 01:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
college leave the state in order to do
 
01:19:29.090 --> 01:19:29.100 align:start position:0%
it and one of the reasons they do that
 
01:19:31.610 --> 01:19:31.620 align:start position:0%
is because of the relative price of
 
01:19:34.189 --> 01:19:34.199 align:start position:0%
universities outside the state versus
 
01:19:36.950 --> 01:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
inside the state and we've tried to
 
01:19:38.630 --> 01:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
address that as as I've already said a
 
01:19:39.709 --> 01:19:39.719 align:start position:0%
couple of times by trying to keep
 
01:19:43.669 --> 01:19:43.679 align:start position:0%
tuition flat and and here's where the
 
01:19:46.130 --> 01:19:46.140 align:start position:0%
the narrative that people believe about
 
01:19:49.970 --> 01:19:49.980 align:start position:0%
tuition is is really not is any longer
 
01:19:51.790 --> 01:19:51.800 align:start position:0%
accurate so you've probably heard
 
01:19:54.410 --> 01:19:54.420 align:start position:0%
double-digit increases Beyond inflation
 
01:19:56.570 --> 01:19:56.580 align:start position:0%
and so on so that may be true in some
 
01:20:00.050 --> 01:20:00.060 align:start position:0%
places but uh at the University system
 
01:20:02.870 --> 01:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
the increase has been zero for five
 
01:20:05.209 --> 01:20:05.219 align:start position:0%
years and if you take into consideration
 
01:20:07.729 --> 01:20:07.739 align:start position:0%
inflation I can't do that math in my
 
01:20:09.770 --> 01:20:09.780 align:start position:0%
head but it's probably a 10 drop five
 
01:20:11.630 --> 01:20:11.640 align:start position:0%
percent drop some number like that so
 
01:20:13.189 --> 01:20:13.199 align:start position:0%
that's something to really be proud of I
 
01:20:15.110 --> 01:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
know that New Hampshire as a state
 
01:20:17.990 --> 01:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
Prides itself on being cost conscious
 
01:20:19.669 --> 01:20:19.679 align:start position:0%
and Frugal and efficient and I think
 
01:20:21.290 --> 01:20:21.300 align:start position:0%
it's fair to say that your State
 
01:20:23.330 --> 01:20:23.340 align:start position:0%
University system is actually really an
 
01:20:25.070 --> 01:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
important part of that
 
01:20:25.080 --> 01:20:27.470 align:start position:0%
important part of that
um

01:20:27.470 --> 01:20:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:29.930 --> 01:20:29.940 align:start position:0%
if we are able to get additional funding
 
01:20:32.689 --> 01:20:32.699 align:start position:0%
from the state then we will be able to
 
01:20:34.850 --> 01:20:34.860 align:start position:0%
continue the tuition freeze making it
 
01:20:36.590 --> 01:20:36.600 align:start position:0%
more competitive for students to be able
 
01:20:38.810 --> 01:20:38.820 align:start position:0%
to come here to stay here in New
 
01:20:40.490 --> 01:20:40.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and
 
01:20:40.500 --> 01:20:41.810 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and
as

01:20:41.810 --> 01:20:41.820 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:20:43.550 --> 01:20:43.560 align:start position:0%
I'll go off script here for a second and
 
01:20:45.530 --> 01:20:45.540 align:start position:0%
just say that as president of the
 
01:20:47.330 --> 01:20:47.340 align:start position:0%
University of New Hampshire one of the
 
01:20:49.550 --> 01:20:49.560 align:start position:0%
practices which I've enjoyed the most is
 
01:20:52.250 --> 01:20:52.260 align:start position:0%
I have office hours for students
 
01:20:54.950 --> 01:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
and so I've spent lots and lots of time
 
01:20:56.950 --> 01:20:56.960 align:start position:0%
in my office with students
 
01:21:00.470 --> 01:21:00.480 align:start position:0%
it's 20 minutes per student and I've
 
01:21:02.930 --> 01:21:02.940 align:start position:0%
learned an awful lot from them and
 
01:21:04.790 --> 01:21:04.800 align:start position:0%
you know I would say if there's one
 
01:21:06.709 --> 01:21:06.719 align:start position:0%
thing that binds them together is that
 
01:21:09.050 --> 01:21:09.060 align:start position:0%
we don't really have students with
 
01:21:10.850 --> 01:21:10.860 align:start position:0%
relatively few exceptions who come from
 
01:21:12.770 --> 01:21:12.780 align:start position:0%
affluent backgrounds they're working
 
01:21:15.229 --> 01:21:15.239 align:start position:0%
class kids middle class kids in some
 
01:21:17.570 --> 01:21:17.580 align:start position:0%
cases really poor kids but but they come
 
01:21:20.090 --> 01:21:20.100 align:start position:0%
to the university to work and to develop
 
01:21:21.770 --> 01:21:21.780 align:start position:0%
themselves and to make something of
 
01:21:24.410 --> 01:21:24.420 align:start position:0%
themselves and there's
 
01:21:26.750 --> 01:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
tens of thousands of them out in the
 
01:21:28.910 --> 01:21:28.920 align:start position:0%
economy now who have started from Modest
 
01:21:30.590 --> 01:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
circumstances and we've given them the
 
01:21:33.110 --> 01:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity no institution can make
 
01:21:35.390 --> 01:21:35.400 align:start position:0%
someone successful all we can do is give
 
01:21:37.310 --> 01:21:37.320 align:start position:0%
them the opportunity and I'm just as
 
01:21:40.790 --> 01:21:40.800 align:start position:0%
pleased as I can be to see them uh to
 
01:21:43.250 --> 01:21:43.260 align:start position:0%
see them become successful and one of
 
01:21:45.110 --> 01:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
the Privileges of being a president is
 
01:21:47.090 --> 01:21:47.100 align:start position:0%
that you almost can it's almost like you
 
01:21:49.130 --> 01:21:49.140 align:start position:0%
have the ability to fast forward because
 
01:21:50.870 --> 01:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
I'll have a student in my office in the
 
01:21:54.290 --> 01:21:54.300 align:start position:0%
morning who comes from a town somewhere
 
01:21:57.110 --> 01:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
in in New Hampshire and then in the
 
01:21:59.570 --> 01:21:59.580 align:start position:0%
afternoon I may go to see an Alum who's
 
01:22:01.370 --> 01:22:01.380 align:start position:0%
20 years older than that and I see that
 
01:22:02.990 --> 01:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
they become successful and I know that's
 
01:22:04.669 --> 01:22:04.679 align:start position:0%
the story and that's what we're helping
 
01:22:06.950 --> 01:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
to do again they're doing it themselves
 
01:22:08.570 --> 01:22:08.580 align:start position:0%
but we're giving them the opportunity to
 
01:22:10.430 --> 01:22:10.440 align:start position:0%
do it and that's the kind of support
 
01:22:11.930 --> 01:22:11.940 align:start position:0%
that we're hoping that you can help us
 
01:22:13.669 --> 01:22:13.679 align:start position:0%
to continue
 
01:22:16.010 --> 01:22:16.020 align:start position:0%
a very quick question since we are
 
01:22:17.930 --> 01:22:17.940 align:start position:0%
talking about you know the number of
 
01:22:20.810 --> 01:22:20.820 align:start position:0%
students that uh you know graduate how
 
01:22:22.250 --> 01:22:22.260 align:start position:0%
many of your students in an average
 
01:22:24.050 --> 01:22:24.060 align:start position:0%
class are New Hampshire residents and
 
01:22:25.970 --> 01:22:25.980 align:start position:0%
how many come from out of state to study
 
01:22:28.010 --> 01:22:28.020 align:start position:0%
here just ballpark I'm not looking you
 
01:22:31.130 --> 01:22:31.140 align:start position:0%
know about 4 000 graduates how many of
 
01:22:32.450 --> 01:22:32.460 align:start position:0%
them were New Hampshire residents how
 
01:22:34.430 --> 01:22:34.440 align:start position:0%
many of them were out of state students
 
01:22:36.530 --> 01:22:36.540 align:start position:0%
who just came to study here across the
 
01:22:38.390 --> 01:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
university system it's about a 50 50
 
01:22:43.790 --> 01:22:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:46.070 --> 01:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
so in on slide 11 I think we've talked
 
01:22:48.290 --> 01:22:48.300 align:start position:0%
about this a little bit already that we
 
01:22:49.970 --> 01:22:49.980 align:start position:0%
are really important in terms of
 
01:22:51.590 --> 01:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
bringing in students from out of state
 
01:22:53.330 --> 01:22:53.340 align:start position:0%
and trying to get them to stay in New
 
01:22:55.550 --> 01:22:55.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to be part of our uh part of
 
01:22:58.490 --> 01:22:58.500 align:start position:0%
our employment that the internships make
 
01:22:59.870 --> 01:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
a big difference these students come in
 
01:23:01.130 --> 01:23:01.140 align:start position:0%
from out of state if they get the
 
01:23:02.870 --> 01:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
internship they're twice as likely to
 
01:23:05.689 --> 01:23:05.699 align:start position:0%
stay and so this funding would help us
 
01:23:07.550 --> 01:23:07.560 align:start position:0%
to have more internships for students
 
01:23:09.590 --> 01:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
which means more workers for the
 
01:23:12.830 --> 01:23:12.840 align:start position:0%
workforce of of New Hampshire and also
 
01:23:15.410 --> 01:23:15.420 align:start position:0%
just in passing I want to mention that
 
01:23:18.110 --> 01:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
of course each of the universities are
 
01:23:19.910 --> 01:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
important economically for the regions
 
01:23:21.530 --> 01:23:21.540 align:start position:0%
that we serve but I think it's
 
01:23:23.270 --> 01:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
particularly important to think about
 
01:23:26.330 --> 01:23:26.340 align:start position:0%
Plymouth State University and Keene
 
01:23:28.669 --> 01:23:28.679 align:start position:0%
State College if I try to think about
 
01:23:30.649 --> 01:23:30.659 align:start position:0%
what those regions would be like if
 
01:23:32.689 --> 01:23:32.699 align:start position:0%
those institutions were to fail it's
 
01:23:34.490 --> 01:23:34.500 align:start position:0%
it's really a nightmare to think about
 
01:23:36.410 --> 01:23:36.420 align:start position:0%
that and so this is one of the other
 
01:23:39.709 --> 01:23:39.719 align:start position:0%
reasons that we really have put Keenan
 
01:23:41.270 --> 01:23:41.280 align:start position:0%
Plymouth in first place in terms of
 
01:23:43.130 --> 01:23:43.140 align:start position:0%
getting funding from this initiative
 
01:23:45.410 --> 01:23:45.420 align:start position:0%
because those regions are so dependent
 
01:23:47.390 --> 01:23:47.400 align:start position:0%
on those institutions and those unit
 
01:23:49.729 --> 01:23:49.739 align:start position:0%
those institutions are a bit fragile at
 
01:23:55.310 --> 01:23:55.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:58.550 --> 01:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
we talk a little bit on page 12 about
 
01:24:02.209 --> 01:24:02.219 align:start position:0%
Cooperative Extension as you know the
 
01:24:04.490 --> 01:24:04.500 align:start position:0%
University of New Hampshire is a
 
01:24:06.110 --> 01:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
land-grant institution which means that
 
01:24:08.570 --> 01:24:08.580 align:start position:0%
Cooperative Extension is Central to our
 
01:24:08.580 --> 01:24:09.669 align:start position:0%
Cooperative Extension is Central to our
mission

01:24:09.669 --> 01:24:09.679 align:start position:0%
mission
 
01:24:13.370 --> 01:24:13.380 align:start position:0%
our mission in 1866 when we were formed
 
01:24:16.430 --> 01:24:16.440 align:start position:0%
was to educate the children of farmers
 
01:24:19.610 --> 01:24:19.620 align:start position:0%
to become effective in farming and also
 
01:24:21.350 --> 01:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
the mechanical Arts
 
01:24:25.669 --> 01:24:25.679 align:start position:0%
uh by coincidence it it's uh 2023 we are
 
01:24:27.950 --> 01:24:27.960 align:start position:0%
100 years from when the name was changed
 
01:24:27.960 --> 01:24:30.770 align:start position:0%
100 years from when the name was changed
uh

01:24:30.770 --> 01:24:30.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:33.590 --> 01:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
to the University of New Hampshire
 
01:24:35.149 --> 01:24:35.159 align:start position:0%
uh we're very proud of that we're going
 
01:24:36.590 --> 01:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
to do some celebrations of that this
 
01:24:38.390 --> 01:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
year but we've really never lost track
 
01:24:41.209 --> 01:24:41.219 align:start position:0%
of that that original uh original
 
01:24:43.550 --> 01:24:43.560 align:start position:0%
Mission uh many of our students come
 
01:24:45.950 --> 01:24:45.960 align:start position:0%
from rural areas we have a very active
 
01:24:49.790 --> 01:24:49.800 align:start position:0%
partnership with 4-H they visit us each
 
01:24:51.950 --> 01:24:51.960 align:start position:0%
year and do a lot of work with our our
 
01:24:54.910 --> 01:24:54.920 align:start position:0%
faculty we continue to have
 
01:24:59.149 --> 01:24:59.159 align:start position:0%
programs both for horses and cows Dairy
 
01:25:01.070 --> 01:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
Barnes and the horse barn and so that
 
01:25:03.050 --> 01:25:03.060 align:start position:0%
that really continues but extension goes
 
01:25:05.090 --> 01:25:05.100 align:start position:0%
well beyond that so extension is working
 
01:25:07.070 --> 01:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
around the state as it says on the slide
 
01:25:09.950 --> 01:25:09.960 align:start position:0%
We Touch over 20 000 people a year in
 
01:25:12.890 --> 01:25:12.900 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and recently just within
 
01:25:14.750 --> 01:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
the last couple of months a tour that
 
01:25:16.430 --> 01:25:16.440 align:start position:0%
our colleague Tom Cronin helped to
 
01:25:19.490 --> 01:25:19.500 align:start position:0%
organize we visited places all over New
 
01:25:22.490 --> 01:25:22.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire including two uh I say
 
01:25:24.229 --> 01:25:24.239 align:start position:0%
municipalities because one's a town and
 
01:25:27.169 --> 01:25:27.179 align:start position:0%
one's a city Rochester and Franklin and
 
01:25:28.850 --> 01:25:28.860 align:start position:0%
our extension teams are working with
 
01:25:31.189 --> 01:25:31.199 align:start position:0%
them to do economic Redevelopment in
 
01:25:33.290 --> 01:25:33.300 align:start position:0%
those areas and help those towns to
 
01:25:35.030 --> 01:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
recreate their economies after they've
 
01:25:36.530 --> 01:25:36.540 align:start position:0%
lost some of the industries that had
 
01:25:38.930 --> 01:25:38.940 align:start position:0%
kept them going for so long so extension
 
01:25:41.390 --> 01:25:41.400 align:start position:0%
while you might think about what's on my
 
01:25:42.950 --> 01:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
soil like and what kind of seeds do I
 
01:25:44.630 --> 01:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
need and we still do all of that but it
 
01:25:46.430 --> 01:25:46.440 align:start position:0%
really goes well beyond that as well and
 
01:25:48.890 --> 01:25:48.900 align:start position:0%
something we're very proud of extension
 
01:25:50.330 --> 01:25:50.340 align:start position:0%
helps us to address some of the most
 
01:25:51.950 --> 01:25:51.960 align:start position:0%
important challenges that the state is
 
01:25:56.350 --> 01:25:56.360 align:start position:0%
facing aging substance abuse and so on
 
01:25:59.330 --> 01:25:59.340 align:start position:0%
Mental Health kinds of things we have a
 
01:26:01.189 --> 01:26:01.199 align:start position:0%
really capable leader in that area Ken
 
01:26:03.350 --> 01:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
Lavalley who is just a a bundle of
 
01:26:04.910 --> 01:26:04.920 align:start position:0%
energy and it would be really great to
 
01:26:07.550 --> 01:26:07.560 align:start position:0%
give them some additional help they also
 
01:26:09.649 --> 01:26:09.659 align:start position:0%
are at funding levels that are beneath
 
01:26:14.290 --> 01:26:14.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:18.770 --> 01:26:18.780 align:start position:0%
so in summary as we get to we have not
 
01:26:21.169 --> 01:26:21.179 align:start position:0%
quite in summary yet but I do think that
 
01:26:23.530 --> 01:26:23.540 align:start position:0%
that this page 13 is a bit of a summary
 
01:26:26.270 --> 01:26:26.280 align:start position:0%
uh that additional funding will help us
 
01:26:28.129 --> 01:26:28.139 align:start position:0%
to support the workforce needs and the
 
01:26:30.590 --> 01:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
quality of life in New Hampshire help us
 
01:26:32.990 --> 01:26:33.000 align:start position:0%
to increase Aid to retain New Hampshire
 
01:26:35.030 --> 01:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
high school graduates support for
 
01:26:36.830 --> 01:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
business collaboration to train and
 
01:26:39.530 --> 01:26:39.540 align:start position:0%
retain usnh graduates and also support
 
01:26:41.090 --> 01:26:41.100 align:start position:0%
to address the health and well-being
 
01:26:43.550 --> 01:26:43.560 align:start position:0%
challenges of our residents this is
 
01:26:46.370 --> 01:26:46.380 align:start position:0%
really what we're looking for support to
 
01:26:49.870 --> 01:26:49.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:53.030 --> 01:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
and that that's the request that's in
 
01:26:55.129 --> 01:26:55.139 align:start position:0%
house bill one
 
01:26:56.870 --> 01:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
um we did
 
01:26:56.880 --> 01:26:57.709 align:start position:0%
um we did
um

01:26:57.709 --> 01:26:57.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:59.330 --> 01:26:59.340 align:start position:0%
I was listening to the governor's
 
01:27:02.330 --> 01:27:02.340 align:start position:0%
address to house finance yesterday and
 
01:27:04.250 --> 01:27:04.260 align:start position:0%
there we haven't seen House Bill 2 yet
 
01:27:07.970 --> 01:27:07.980 align:start position:0%
but there are a couple yeah there are
 
01:27:10.129 --> 01:27:10.139 align:start position:0%
there the governor did mention a couple
 
01:27:13.669 --> 01:27:13.679 align:start position:0%
of projects for for the University that
 
01:27:16.490 --> 01:27:16.500 align:start position:0%
are in-house Bill too so we wanted to
 
01:27:20.750 --> 01:27:20.760 align:start position:0%
mention those as well and now that Jim
 
01:27:23.629 --> 01:27:23.639 align:start position:0%
has had an opportunity to take a breath
 
01:27:26.390 --> 01:27:26.400 align:start position:0%
on page 14.
 
01:27:26.400 --> 01:27:27.649 align:start position:0%
on page 14.
um

01:27:27.649 --> 01:27:27.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:29.810 --> 01:27:29.820 align:start position:0%
an eight million dollar investment in
 
01:27:32.209 --> 01:27:32.219 align:start position:0%
the Whittemore Center
 
01:27:34.790 --> 01:27:34.800 align:start position:0%
the winamore center
 
01:27:36.410 --> 01:27:36.420 align:start position:0%
um has quite a bit of deferred
 
01:27:36.420 --> 01:27:37.370 align:start position:0%
um has quite a bit of deferred
maintenance

01:27:37.370 --> 01:27:37.380 align:start position:0%
maintenance
 
01:27:40.610 --> 01:27:40.620 align:start position:0%
it it would if you're ever interested
 
01:27:43.550 --> 01:27:43.560 align:start position:0%
love to have you over for a tour
 
01:27:46.010 --> 01:27:46.020 align:start position:0%
um the the eight million dollar State
 
01:27:48.050 --> 01:27:48.060 align:start position:0%
investment I think um we're thinking
 
01:27:50.149 --> 01:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
about is a public-private university
 
01:27:50.159 --> 01:27:51.709 align:start position:0%
about is a public-private university
partnership

01:27:51.709 --> 01:27:51.719 align:start position:0%
partnership
 
01:27:54.470 --> 01:27:54.480 align:start position:0%
that the university would put dollars in
 
01:27:56.930 --> 01:27:56.940 align:start position:0%
donors would put dollars in and the
 
01:27:59.930 --> 01:27:59.940 align:start position:0%
state would put dollars in to have
 
01:27:59.940 --> 01:28:00.950 align:start position:0%
state would put dollars in to have
um

01:28:00.950 --> 01:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:03.669 --> 01:28:03.679 align:start position:0%
a center that the state can be proud of
 
01:28:07.669 --> 01:28:07.679 align:start position:0%
a facility that D1 hockey players would
 
01:28:09.350 --> 01:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
be proud of
 
01:28:12.350 --> 01:28:12.360 align:start position:0%
um it's used by more than the UNH hockey
 
01:28:15.950 --> 01:28:15.960 align:start position:0%
team and and really to to build pride in
 
01:28:18.229 --> 01:28:18.239 align:start position:0%
the state and and the university so
 
01:28:24.110 --> 01:28:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:25.970 --> 01:28:25.980 align:start position:0%
thank you as being facetious yesterday
 
01:28:29.330 --> 01:28:29.340 align:start position:0%
when I asked about why not football but
 
01:28:33.229 --> 01:28:33.239 align:start position:0%
um the Whittemore Center has been our
 
01:28:35.930 --> 01:28:35.940 align:start position:0%
Splendid resource for our high schools
 
01:28:38.990 --> 01:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
and for all our teams for many many
 
01:28:41.390 --> 01:28:41.400 align:start position:0%
reasons I I've gone to the Whittemore
 
01:28:43.910 --> 01:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
Center for all kinds of Not Just Hockey
 
01:28:45.590 --> 01:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
but many many things
 
01:28:49.010 --> 01:28:49.020 align:start position:0%
so I know that it's possible to use that
 
01:28:53.030 --> 01:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
as a revenue generating facility
 
01:28:55.970 --> 01:28:55.980 align:start position:0%
is it and how does that work and are you
 
01:28:58.729 --> 01:28:58.739 align:start position:0%
trying to promote that more
 
01:29:00.770 --> 01:29:00.780 align:start position:0%
that's an excellent question thank you
 
01:29:02.450 --> 01:29:02.460 align:start position:0%
so much yes and it has been used for a
 
01:29:03.790 --> 01:29:03.800 align:start position:0%
number of things
 
01:29:06.290 --> 01:29:06.300 align:start position:0%
we actually are asking that question on
 
01:29:09.290 --> 01:29:09.300 align:start position:0%
campus now and we're utilizing our
 
01:29:11.090 --> 01:29:11.100 align:start position:0%
business School faculty and students to
 
01:29:13.430 --> 01:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
do an analysis to see what Revenue
 
01:29:16.390 --> 01:29:16.400 align:start position:0%
opportunities there are some of the
 
01:29:19.370 --> 01:29:19.380 align:start position:0%
people some of our alums who are
 
01:29:22.129 --> 01:29:22.139 align:start position:0%
contributing funding to this are also
 
01:29:23.930 --> 01:29:23.940 align:start position:0%
saying let's see what else we can do to
 
01:29:25.370 --> 01:29:25.380 align:start position:0%
generate more Revenue so you're in good
 
01:29:28.010 --> 01:29:28.020 align:start position:0%
company with that idea one other and
 
01:29:29.750 --> 01:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
this is I'm sorry
 
01:29:31.250 --> 01:29:31.260 align:start position:0%
well maybe I'll just finish that detail
 
01:29:33.410 --> 01:29:33.420 align:start position:0%
and then go to so one one last thing I
 
01:29:34.550 --> 01:29:34.560 align:start position:0%
wanted to say about the whittlemore
 
01:29:37.189 --> 01:29:37.199 align:start position:0%
center is that you you may or may not
 
01:29:38.930 --> 01:29:38.940 align:start position:0%
know this I'm never clear how well these
 
01:29:41.209 --> 01:29:41.219 align:start position:0%
stories get out but one of the elements
 
01:29:42.770 --> 01:29:42.780 align:start position:0%
of the University that we're incredibly
 
01:29:45.290 --> 01:29:45.300 align:start position:0%
proud of is called Northeast passage and
 
01:29:47.149 --> 01:29:47.159 align:start position:0%
Northeast passage is an organization
 
01:29:49.870 --> 01:29:49.880 align:start position:0%
that's part of unh that facilitates
 
01:29:52.490 --> 01:29:52.500 align:start position:0%
participation in athletic competition by
 
01:29:54.350 --> 01:29:54.360 align:start position:0%
people who have one sort of disability
 
01:29:57.470 --> 01:29:57.480 align:start position:0%
or handicap or another and hockey is
 
01:30:01.070 --> 01:30:01.080 align:start position:0%
actually one of the activities that not
 
01:30:03.290 --> 01:30:03.300 align:start position:0%
only that they enjoy but that we've we
 
01:30:07.010 --> 01:30:07.020 align:start position:0%
have helped to train a number of sled
 
01:30:09.169 --> 01:30:09.179 align:start position:0%
hockey athletes who have competed at the
 
01:30:10.850 --> 01:30:10.860 align:start position:0%
international level and the Olympics and
 
01:30:13.790 --> 01:30:13.800 align:start position:0%
so on but that's the small number the
 
01:30:15.890 --> 01:30:15.900 align:start position:0%
biggest number just out there enjoying
 
01:30:18.530 --> 01:30:18.540 align:start position:0%
being able to exercise part of this
 
01:30:21.169 --> 01:30:21.179 align:start position:0%
renovation would allow the Northeast
 
01:30:22.790 --> 01:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
passage hockey players should be able to
 
01:30:24.890 --> 01:30:24.900 align:start position:0%
use the locker room at Whitmore Center
 
01:30:26.270 --> 01:30:26.280 align:start position:0%
so that they could use the ice at the
 
01:30:28.129 --> 01:30:28.139 align:start position:0%
Whitmore Center uh and they're they're
 
01:30:29.810 --> 01:30:29.820 align:start position:0%
really quite inspiring so I just wanted
 
01:30:34.310 --> 01:30:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:37.430 --> 01:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:30:41.030 --> 01:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
um normally a building project we see in
 
01:30:45.950 --> 01:30:45.960 align:start position:0%
HB 2025 and almost half of hb25 is
 
01:30:49.250 --> 01:30:49.260 align:start position:0%
involved with college buildings uh it's
 
01:30:52.030 --> 01:30:52.040 align:start position:0%
unusual to have this in hp2
 
01:30:54.290 --> 01:30:54.300 align:start position:0%
and normally you raise a lot of this
 
01:30:57.890 --> 01:30:57.900 align:start position:0%
money yourself so that um you know and I
 
01:31:00.169 --> 01:31:00.179 align:start position:0%
remember almost 20 years ago when I was
 
01:31:01.970 --> 01:31:01.980 align:start position:0%
on the higher education study committee
 
01:31:04.189 --> 01:31:04.199 align:start position:0%
and we went around to several campuses
 
01:31:06.709 --> 01:31:06.719 align:start position:0%
and and finally the board of unh
 
01:31:09.169 --> 01:31:09.179 align:start position:0%
admitted they weren't spending enough on
 
01:31:09.179 --> 01:31:10.189 align:start position:0%
admitted they weren't spending enough on
maintenance

01:31:10.189 --> 01:31:10.199 align:start position:0%
maintenance
 
01:31:12.649 --> 01:31:12.659 align:start position:0%
and we were reluctant to keep giving
 
01:31:13.970 --> 01:31:13.980 align:start position:0%
them new buildings if they weren't
 
01:31:15.530 --> 01:31:15.540 align:start position:0%
taking care of the ones we already gave
 
01:31:18.470 --> 01:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
them so they decided at at that time
 
01:31:20.689 --> 01:31:20.699 align:start position:0%
like I don't know it was 95 or something
 
01:31:22.850 --> 01:31:22.860 align:start position:0%
that yeah they did need to spend more in
 
01:31:24.290 --> 01:31:24.300 align:start position:0%
maintenance instead of letting a
 
01:31:25.910 --> 01:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
building deteriorate and then say you
 
01:31:28.310 --> 01:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
need to replace it so I don't know if
 
01:31:30.470 --> 01:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
that's still ongoing but normally
 
01:31:33.350 --> 01:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
construction projects end up in eight HP
 
01:31:36.530 --> 01:31:36.540 align:start position:0%
40 25 so
 
01:31:38.510 --> 01:31:38.520 align:start position:0%
so um thank you for the question
 
01:31:40.430 --> 01:31:40.440 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler
 
01:31:43.129 --> 01:31:43.139 align:start position:0%
um just a point of clarification it's my
 
01:31:45.229 --> 01:31:45.239 align:start position:0%
understanding that half of the state's
 
01:31:47.930 --> 01:31:47.940 align:start position:0%
capital budget is not going to college
 
01:31:50.209 --> 01:31:50.219 align:start position:0%
universities I I don't know how much the
 
01:31:51.590 --> 01:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
general fund portion of the bonded
 
01:31:54.169 --> 01:31:54.179 align:start position:0%
portion is this year on HP 25 but if
 
01:31:57.410 --> 01:31:57.420 align:start position:0%
it's around 125 million I think the
 
01:31:59.510 --> 01:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
university system is allocated 17
 
01:31:59.520 --> 01:32:01.850 align:start position:0%
university system is allocated 17
million

01:32:01.850 --> 01:32:01.860 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:32:05.510 --> 01:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
um so and I can only speak uh I have
 
01:32:07.610 --> 01:32:07.620 align:start position:0%
been at the University system for almost
 
01:32:10.550 --> 01:32:10.560 align:start position:0%
nine years I've missed you thank you
 
01:32:13.310 --> 01:32:13.320 align:start position:0%
representative and um
 
01:32:15.530 --> 01:32:15.540 align:start position:0%
on your question about deferred
 
01:32:15.540 --> 01:32:16.490 align:start position:0%
on your question about deferred
maintenance

01:32:16.490 --> 01:32:16.500 align:start position:0%
maintenance
 
01:32:18.890 --> 01:32:18.900 align:start position:0%
we've had a requirement probably for the
 
01:32:22.610 --> 01:32:22.620 align:start position:0%
past seven plus years
 
01:32:25.250 --> 01:32:25.260 align:start position:0%
um our annual capital budget at the
 
01:32:26.930 --> 01:32:26.940 align:start position:0%
University system
 
01:32:30.110 --> 01:32:30.120 align:start position:0%
of the University system funds is about
 
01:32:32.450 --> 01:32:32.460 align:start position:0%
65 million dollars
 
01:32:35.990 --> 01:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
and where that comes from is that's the
 
01:32:37.910 --> 01:32:37.920 align:start position:0%
amount of depreciation
 
01:32:40.570 --> 01:32:40.580 align:start position:0%
that we have each year on our buildings
 
01:32:44.330 --> 01:32:44.340 align:start position:0%
so it makes sense that you reinvest that
 
01:32:47.689 --> 01:32:47.699 align:start position:0%
in your Capital plant for for our our
 
01:32:50.209 --> 01:32:50.219 align:start position:0%
programming so when we think about and
 
01:32:51.590 --> 01:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
this we'd certainly have this
 
01:32:53.570 --> 01:32:53.580 align:start position:0%
conversation with how house Public Works
 
01:32:55.370 --> 01:32:55.380 align:start position:0%
I think we do in a couple of weeks when
 
01:32:57.350 --> 01:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
you think about all the funding for the
 
01:33:00.410 --> 01:33:00.420 align:start position:0%
University system Capital program if
 
01:33:02.090 --> 01:33:02.100 align:start position:0%
we're if the university system is
 
01:33:05.209 --> 01:33:05.219 align:start position:0%
contributing 25 and the state is
 
01:33:06.950 --> 01:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
contributing eight and a half because
 
01:33:09.950 --> 01:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
the 17 is over a two-year period
 
01:33:13.129 --> 01:33:13.139 align:start position:0%
um there's some of it is bonded debt
 
01:33:15.050 --> 01:33:15.060 align:start position:0%
only for
 
01:33:17.689 --> 01:33:17.699 align:start position:0%
res halls and dining facilities we
 
01:33:21.169 --> 01:33:21.179 align:start position:0%
cannot bond for our academic buildings
 
01:33:23.930 --> 01:33:23.940 align:start position:0%
so the the um anyway I just want to give
 
01:33:25.669 --> 01:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
you a background on our entire Capital
 
01:33:28.669 --> 01:33:28.679 align:start position:0%
program and we've now started we have a
 
01:33:30.649 --> 01:33:30.659 align:start position:0%
assessment report done so that we can
 
01:33:33.229 --> 01:33:33.239 align:start position:0%
make sure that facilities
 
01:33:33.239 --> 01:33:34.550 align:start position:0%
make sure that facilities
um

01:33:34.550 --> 01:33:34.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:37.189 --> 01:33:37.199 align:start position:0%
are being kept up where they should be I
 
01:33:40.070 --> 01:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
can tell you not all of them are because
 
01:33:42.890 --> 01:33:42.900 align:start position:0%
you have to prioritize
 
01:33:48.290 --> 01:33:48.300 align:start position:0%
um so on the question of hb2 versus hb25
 
01:33:50.450 --> 01:33:50.460 align:start position:0%
representative I I don't have an answer
 
01:33:53.750 --> 01:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
for that I believe from my time as state
 
01:33:53.760 --> 01:33:55.010 align:start position:0%
for that I believe from my time as state
treasurer

01:33:55.010 --> 01:33:55.020 align:start position:0%
treasurer
 
01:33:59.209 --> 01:33:59.219 align:start position:0%
most of what's in hb25 that's General
 
01:34:02.810 --> 01:34:02.820 align:start position:0%
funded is bonded
 
01:34:05.689 --> 01:34:05.699 align:start position:0%
and I believe the governor's intention
 
01:34:09.950 --> 01:34:09.960 align:start position:0%
in including this in hb2 is that it not
 
01:34:13.850 --> 01:34:13.860 align:start position:0%
be bonded it be funded with
 
01:34:16.610 --> 01:34:16.620 align:start position:0%
Surplus that the state has generated I
 
01:34:17.689 --> 01:34:17.699 align:start position:0%
mean that's not to say you couldn't
 
01:34:21.050 --> 01:34:21.060 align:start position:0%
rethink hb25 but that's what I'm that's
 
01:34:24.050 --> 01:34:24.060 align:start position:0%
what I'm thinking of the hb2 versus hb20
 
01:34:26.030 --> 01:34:26.040 align:start position:0%
sorry I was a little off I'm going back
 
01:34:29.149 --> 01:34:29.159 align:start position:0%
a few years on 1825 but I haven't looked
 
01:34:31.610 --> 01:34:31.620 align:start position:0%
at it in deep for a while but I remember
 
01:34:33.890 --> 01:34:33.900 align:start position:0%
at one point it did seem like almost
 
01:34:36.229 --> 01:34:36.239 align:start position:0%
half the buildings for for many many
 
01:34:38.450 --> 01:34:38.460 align:start position:0%
years there was a program we're getting
 
01:34:40.250 --> 01:34:40.260 align:start position:0%
in the weeds here a little bit but there
 
01:34:43.070 --> 01:34:43.080 align:start position:0%
was a program called uh keep it was an
 
01:34:46.550 --> 01:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
acronym for knowledge but and the state
 
01:34:48.110 --> 01:34:48.120 align:start position:0%
was funding
 
01:34:52.370 --> 01:34:52.380 align:start position:0%
I believe 30 million dollars each
 
01:34:52.380 --> 01:34:53.990 align:start position:0%
I believe 30 million dollars each
biennium

01:34:53.990 --> 01:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
01:34:57.490 --> 01:34:57.500 align:start position:0%
for University system academic buildings
 
01:35:02.270 --> 01:35:02.280 align:start position:0%
that was peeled back significantly
 
01:35:06.229 --> 01:35:06.239 align:start position:0%
maybe when it ended in 13 or 14 it could
 
01:35:08.510 --> 01:35:08.520 align:start position:0%
be then when we came out of the gate
 
01:35:11.030 --> 01:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
there was 3 million over a two-year
 
01:35:11.040 --> 01:35:11.990 align:start position:0%
there was 3 million over a two-year
period

01:35:11.990 --> 01:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
period
 
01:35:16.610 --> 01:35:16.620 align:start position:0%
so in the upcoming biennium it it was it
 
01:35:21.110 --> 01:35:21.120 align:start position:0%
is 17 million over the biennium and and
 
01:35:23.270 --> 01:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
so happy to talk more about the capital
 
01:35:27.229 --> 01:35:27.239 align:start position:0%
but but that's that's where we are now
 
01:35:29.090 --> 01:35:29.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:35:31.129 --> 01:35:31.139 align:start position:0%
taking the questions you already know
 
01:35:33.110 --> 01:35:33.120 align:start position:0%
that Finance is the most weed friendly
 
01:35:34.850 --> 01:35:34.860 align:start position:0%
committee so don't be afraid of the
 
01:35:38.149 --> 01:35:38.159 align:start position:0%
weeds a quick question on the um with a
 
01:35:40.310 --> 01:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
more Center project we are obviously
 
01:35:42.050 --> 01:35:42.060 align:start position:0%
asking for eight Millions from the state
 
01:35:43.729 --> 01:35:43.739 align:start position:0%
budget could you just give me a rough
 
01:35:45.950 --> 01:35:45.960 align:start position:0%
breakdown of where the other 22 million
 
01:35:48.709 --> 01:35:48.719 align:start position:0%
will be coming from
 
01:35:52.550 --> 01:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
source of funds yeah about 13 million
 
01:35:54.350 --> 01:35:54.360 align:start position:0%
dollars of it will be coming from the
 
01:35:56.209 --> 01:35:56.219 align:start position:0%
University and the rest would be coming
 
01:35:58.430 --> 01:35:58.440 align:start position:0%
from private donors
 
01:36:00.070 --> 01:36:00.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:36:04.070 --> 01:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
thank you can we go back to uh Keene
 
01:36:06.290 --> 01:36:06.300 align:start position:0%
State and Plymouth and the difference
 
01:36:08.750 --> 01:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
between the three million that is in the
 
01:36:09.950 --> 01:36:09.960 align:start position:0%
second year of the biennium and I've
 
01:36:12.649 --> 01:36:12.659 align:start position:0%
lost my page and your request for the 8
 
01:36:14.510 --> 01:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
million uh can you say what you do with
 
01:36:16.310 --> 01:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
that that other five million dollars in
 
01:36:19.070 --> 01:36:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:21.770 --> 01:36:21.780 align:start position:0%
the so
 
01:36:26.270 --> 01:36:26.280 align:start position:0%
the um we will do everything we can with
 
01:36:30.110 --> 01:36:30.120 align:start position:0%
the governor's recommended budget
 
01:36:30.120 --> 01:36:31.010 align:start position:0%
the governor's recommended budget
um

01:36:31.010 --> 01:36:31.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:33.950 --> 01:36:33.960 align:start position:0%
at funding at the level that the
 
01:36:35.689 --> 01:36:35.699 align:start position:0%
university system
 
01:36:35.699 --> 01:36:37.970 align:start position:0%
university system
requested

01:36:37.970 --> 01:36:37.980 align:start position:0%
requested
 
01:36:39.470 --> 01:36:39.480 align:start position:0%
um I think we could build out more
 
01:36:41.750 --> 01:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
robust programs
 
01:36:45.890 --> 01:36:45.900 align:start position:0%
for internships and Partnerships at with
 
01:36:48.669 --> 01:36:48.679 align:start position:0%
our business communities in those areas
 
01:36:52.010 --> 01:36:52.020 align:start position:0%
we will do everything we can
 
01:36:54.169 --> 01:36:54.179 align:start position:0%
um but but that that
 
01:36:57.410 --> 01:36:57.420 align:start position:0%
the the five million dollar reduction is
 
01:36:57.420 --> 01:36:58.850 align:start position:0%
the the five million dollar reduction is
significant

01:36:58.850 --> 01:36:58.860 align:start position:0%
significant
 
01:37:01.370 --> 01:37:01.380 align:start position:0%
but but I don't
 
01:37:03.890 --> 01:37:03.900 align:start position:0%
I want to be clear that that
 
01:37:03.900 --> 01:37:05.450 align:start position:0%
I want to be clear that that
um

01:37:05.450 --> 01:37:05.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:07.490 --> 01:37:07.500 align:start position:0%
the university system is pleased with
 
01:37:09.110 --> 01:37:09.120 align:start position:0%
the increase that the governor has
 
01:37:11.870 --> 01:37:11.880 align:start position:0%
proposed I've been around here quite a
 
01:37:14.510 --> 01:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
number of years and and we have not
 
01:37:14.520 --> 01:37:16.610 align:start position:0%
number of years and and we have not
received

01:37:16.610 --> 01:37:16.620 align:start position:0%
received
 
01:37:16.620 --> 01:37:18.950 align:start position:0%
received
um

01:37:18.950 --> 01:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:21.169 --> 01:37:21.179 align:start position:0%
meaningful I shouldn't or sizable
 
01:37:21.179 --> 01:37:23.090 align:start position:0%
meaningful I shouldn't or sizable
increases

01:37:23.090 --> 01:37:23.100 align:start position:0%
increases
 
01:37:26.270 --> 01:37:26.280 align:start position:0%
um we could do more if we had more
 
01:37:30.530 --> 01:37:30.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:33.410 --> 01:37:33.420 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr chairman uh
 
01:37:36.709 --> 01:37:36.719 align:start position:0%
on uh the university system itself what
 
01:37:38.689 --> 01:37:38.699 align:start position:0%
what do we gain by being a university
 
01:37:41.570 --> 01:37:41.580 align:start position:0%
system versus say Plymouth and Keenan
 
01:37:46.990 --> 01:37:47.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:49.430 --> 01:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
it's a really good question I I think
 
01:37:51.950 --> 01:37:51.960 align:start position:0%
that probably the the biggest
 
01:37:54.110 --> 01:37:54.120 align:start position:0%
uh the biggest Advantage is the
 
01:37:57.169 --> 01:37:57.179 align:start position:0%
opportunity to have services that are
 
01:38:00.229 --> 01:38:00.239 align:start position:0%
provided to all of the universities as
 
01:38:01.729 --> 01:38:01.739 align:start position:0%
opposed to having to reproduce those
 
01:38:03.229 --> 01:38:03.239 align:start position:0%
services for each individual
 
01:38:05.270 --> 01:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
universities so I'm not going to
 
01:38:07.310 --> 01:38:07.320 align:start position:0%
remember all of them but probably the
 
01:38:09.290 --> 01:38:09.300 align:start position:0%
biggest ticket item right now is
 
01:38:12.169 --> 01:38:12.179 align:start position:0%
information technology so we have one
 
01:38:14.570 --> 01:38:14.580 align:start position:0%
Information Technology organization that
 
01:38:18.110 --> 01:38:18.120 align:start position:0%
serves Keen Plymouth and UNH and that
 
01:38:20.110 --> 01:38:20.120 align:start position:0%
that wasn't always like that in fact
 
01:38:23.030 --> 01:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
three-ish years ago we made that change
 
01:38:25.370 --> 01:38:25.380 align:start position:0%
which resulted in several million
 
01:38:28.250 --> 01:38:28.260 align:start position:0%
dollars in savings we have to my
 
01:38:30.470 --> 01:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
knowledge always had a Consolidated
 
01:38:33.229 --> 01:38:33.239 align:start position:0%
general counsel's office well for a long
 
01:38:35.030 --> 01:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
long time right and we save a lot of
 
01:38:36.649 --> 01:38:36.659 align:start position:0%
money there versus having individual
 
01:38:38.830 --> 01:38:38.840 align:start position:0%
councils for each one
 
01:38:41.870 --> 01:38:41.880 align:start position:0%
we are increasingly centralizing human
 
01:38:44.510 --> 01:38:44.520 align:start position:0%
resources which also results in savings
 
01:38:47.209 --> 01:38:47.219 align:start position:0%
so that we can have consistency of
 
01:38:49.790 --> 01:38:49.800 align:start position:0%
policies but also have the economies of
 
01:38:52.189 --> 01:38:52.199 align:start position:0%
scale associated with HR working across
 
01:38:54.830 --> 01:38:54.840 align:start position:0%
the University Systems there's probably
 
01:38:57.050 --> 01:38:57.060 align:start position:0%
less tangible advantages about
 
01:38:58.790 --> 01:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
coordination of marketing and things
 
01:39:01.010 --> 01:39:01.020 align:start position:0%
like that but the main thing would be a
 
01:39:03.770 --> 01:39:03.780 align:start position:0%
provision of of services in a
 
01:39:05.330 --> 01:39:05.340 align:start position:0%
centralized way that saves us a lot of
 
01:39:05.340 --> 01:39:06.790 align:start position:0%
centralized way that saves us a lot of
money

01:39:06.790 --> 01:39:06.800 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:39:10.370 --> 01:39:10.380 align:start position:0%
just to give you very specific
 
01:39:10.380 --> 01:39:12.229 align:start position:0%
just to give you very specific
so

01:39:12.229 --> 01:39:12.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:39:12.239 --> 01:39:13.490 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:39:13.490 --> 01:39:13.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:16.550 --> 01:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
Plymouth and keen and UNH each issuing
 
01:39:19.550 --> 01:39:19.560 align:start position:0%
their own debt would make very little
 
01:39:22.310 --> 01:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
sense even payroll my office is
 
01:39:24.830 --> 01:39:24.840 align:start position:0%
responsible for payroll making sure
 
01:39:26.030 --> 01:39:26.040 align:start position:0%
there's enough money in the bank
 
01:39:29.030 --> 01:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
coordinating all the treasury functions
 
01:39:31.729 --> 01:39:31.739 align:start position:0%
if Plymouth and Keenan and UNH each had
 
01:39:34.729 --> 01:39:34.739 align:start position:0%
to do all that TR I I think it would be
 
01:39:38.570 --> 01:39:38.580 align:start position:0%
highly inefficient we're driving toward
 
01:39:40.550 --> 01:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
fission we have to drive toward more
 
01:39:43.610 --> 01:39:43.620 align:start position:0%
efficiency and and so I think that
 
01:39:45.830 --> 01:39:45.840 align:start position:0%
that would not benefit certainly our
 
01:39:50.330 --> 01:39:50.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:52.790 --> 01:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
cheer I just want to make a comment um
 
01:39:55.070 --> 01:39:55.080 align:start position:0%
first of all I want to just send
 
01:39:57.770 --> 01:39:57.780 align:start position:0%
accolades to you for working with um
 
01:40:00.169 --> 01:40:00.179 align:start position:0%
Mike skeleton in the Chamber of Commerce
 
01:40:03.050 --> 01:40:03.060 align:start position:0%
I really see the university system is
 
01:40:05.149 --> 01:40:05.159 align:start position:0%
kind of the engine for New Hampshire
 
01:40:08.330 --> 01:40:08.340 align:start position:0%
we're an aging State our young
 
01:40:11.050 --> 01:40:11.060 align:start position:0%
population has declined significantly
 
01:40:14.810 --> 01:40:14.820 align:start position:0%
we're in desperate need of of
 
01:40:18.350 --> 01:40:18.360 align:start position:0%
um employees I live in Manchester
 
01:40:20.810 --> 01:40:20.820 align:start position:0%
um we're a hub for technology and
 
01:40:23.330 --> 01:40:23.340 align:start position:0%
without the benefit of our University
 
01:40:26.209 --> 01:40:26.219 align:start position:0%
system I don't know what we do you are
 
01:40:29.410 --> 01:40:29.420 align:start position:0%
producing our future and you're keeping
 
01:40:33.110 --> 01:40:33.120 align:start position:0%
so many students that come from out of
 
01:40:33.120 --> 01:40:34.129 align:start position:0%
so many students that come from out of
state

01:40:34.129 --> 01:40:34.139 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:40:37.070 --> 01:40:37.080 align:start position:0%
in our state because they're going to
 
01:40:40.129 --> 01:40:40.139 align:start position:0%
jobs that are so and what Dean came is
 
01:40:42.709 --> 01:40:42.719 align:start position:0%
doing is so remarkable and and I see
 
01:40:45.950 --> 01:40:45.960 align:start position:0%
what they're doing at UNH Manchester and
 
01:40:48.229 --> 01:40:48.239 align:start position:0%
the the labs that they have in place so
 
01:40:51.770 --> 01:40:51.780 align:start position:0%
I just want to say yay because I am so
 
01:40:54.770 --> 01:40:54.780 align:start position:0%
pleased with I've seen and learned your
 
01:40:56.570 --> 01:40:56.580 align:start position:0%
Innovation Center that you have on
 
01:40:59.689 --> 01:40:59.699 align:start position:0%
campus is something that I would
 
01:41:01.970 --> 01:41:01.980 align:start position:0%
encourage all of us to take a look at
 
01:41:04.610 --> 01:41:04.620 align:start position:0%
because it's just extraordinary but I
 
01:41:06.410 --> 01:41:06.420 align:start position:0%
want to say thank you because I I just
 
01:41:09.290 --> 01:41:09.300 align:start position:0%
feel like UNH is playing a significant
 
01:41:11.330 --> 01:41:11.340 align:start position:0%
role in the future of our state right
 
01:41:13.910 --> 01:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
now more than ever before
 
01:41:15.709 --> 01:41:15.719 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:41:18.410 --> 01:41:18.420 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you again I'd like to
 
01:41:20.270 --> 01:41:20.280 align:start position:0%
give you the opportunity to speak to how
 
01:41:22.430 --> 01:41:22.440 align:start position:0%
UNH is perceived outside of New
 
01:41:25.010 --> 01:41:25.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire one thing in particular when
 
01:41:27.709 --> 01:41:27.719 align:start position:0%
you're hiring faculty how many uh when
 
01:41:29.930 --> 01:41:29.940 align:start position:0%
you make an offer to someone How likely
 
01:41:32.450 --> 01:41:32.460 align:start position:0%
is that person going to come to teach at
 
01:41:34.430 --> 01:41:34.440 align:start position:0%
UNH as opposed to deciding to go to
 
01:41:36.590 --> 01:41:36.600 align:start position:0%
another University but you know more
 
01:41:38.629 --> 01:41:38.639 align:start position:0%
generally how is UNH perceived outside
 
01:41:41.050 --> 01:41:41.060 align:start position:0%
because you have some very unique and
 
01:41:44.689 --> 01:41:44.699 align:start position:0%
Powerful programs at the University
 
01:41:44.699 --> 01:41:46.209 align:start position:0%
Powerful programs at the University
foreign

01:41:46.209 --> 01:41:46.219 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:41:50.870 --> 01:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:55.970 --> 01:41:55.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:58.729 --> 01:41:58.739 align:start position:0%
we have had a great deal of success in
 
01:42:01.550 --> 01:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
recruiting faculty to the university I I
 
01:42:03.109 --> 01:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
don't know that I've ever heard of a
 
01:42:04.729 --> 01:42:04.739 align:start position:0%
situation in which we've wanted to hire
 
01:42:07.010 --> 01:42:07.020 align:start position:0%
into a certain discipline and we've been
 
01:42:08.990 --> 01:42:09.000 align:start position:0%
unable to do that
 
01:42:11.570 --> 01:42:11.580 align:start position:0%
um are we able to hire every single and
 
01:42:13.669 --> 01:42:13.679 align:start position:0%
no of course not the people we make
 
01:42:15.229 --> 01:42:15.239 align:start position:0%
offers to
 
01:42:15.239 --> 01:42:17.229 align:start position:0%
offers to
um

01:42:17.229 --> 01:42:17.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:20.270 --> 01:42:20.280 align:start position:0%
disciplines are different some of them
 
01:42:22.729 --> 01:42:22.739 align:start position:0%
are much more competitive than others if
 
01:42:24.290 --> 01:42:24.300 align:start position:0%
you take uh
 
01:42:26.030 --> 01:42:26.040 align:start position:0%
sadly from my point of view the
 
01:42:28.370 --> 01:42:28.380 align:start position:0%
humanities disciplines there are fewer
 
01:42:31.550 --> 01:42:31.560 align:start position:0%
jobs available uh nationally for
 
01:42:33.890 --> 01:42:33.900 align:start position:0%
professors in the humanities and so it's
 
01:42:36.010 --> 01:42:36.020 align:start position:0%
not at all unusual to get
 
01:42:39.470 --> 01:42:39.480 align:start position:0%
150 applicants for a job in history or
 
01:42:41.450 --> 01:42:41.460 align:start position:0%
English or philosophy or what have you
 
01:42:41.460 --> 01:42:43.310 align:start position:0%
English or philosophy or what have you
uh

01:42:43.310 --> 01:42:43.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:42:46.550 --> 01:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
and so of course we do very well uh in
 
01:42:48.470 --> 01:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
hiring in those areas then there's other
 
01:42:50.330 --> 01:42:50.340 align:start position:0%
areas where we have and you've
 
01:42:52.250 --> 01:42:52.260 align:start position:0%
acknowledged this in your question where
 
01:42:54.169 --> 01:42:54.179 align:start position:0%
we have a national and even in
 
01:42:56.450 --> 01:42:56.460 align:start position:0%
international reputation so for example
 
01:42:58.129 --> 01:42:58.139 align:start position:0%
in anything having to do with space
 
01:43:00.950 --> 01:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
anything having to do with the ocean we
 
01:43:03.169 --> 01:43:03.179 align:start position:0%
are among the world leaders in research
 
01:43:05.450 --> 01:43:05.460 align:start position:0%
and and teaching in those spaces and
 
01:43:07.609 --> 01:43:07.619 align:start position:0%
people really come in and look to to
 
01:43:09.590 --> 01:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
come to to UNH
 
01:43:12.470 --> 01:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
um to be able to work in those areas
 
01:43:14.510 --> 01:43:14.520 align:start position:0%
uh I was mentioning in a previous
 
01:43:18.350 --> 01:43:18.360 align:start position:0%
conversation today that we had the
 
01:43:21.410 --> 01:43:21.420 align:start position:0%
the NASA administrator the head of NASA
 
01:43:22.490 --> 01:43:22.500 align:start position:0%
is called the administrator I think
 
01:43:24.530 --> 01:43:24.540 align:start position:0%
that's funny but that's his title and so
 
01:43:27.410 --> 01:43:27.420 align:start position:0%
so he came to visit with us a couple of
 
01:43:28.729 --> 01:43:28.739 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
01:43:31.250 --> 01:43:31.260 align:start position:0%
in in conjunction with a very big grant
 
01:43:33.890 --> 01:43:33.900 align:start position:0%
that we've gotten and had a morning of
 
01:43:36.530 --> 01:43:36.540 align:start position:0%
presentations most of which featured our
 
01:43:38.750 --> 01:43:38.760 align:start position:0%
students so the idea that you come to
 
01:43:40.669 --> 01:43:40.679 align:start position:0%
UNH you're a student and not just a
 
01:43:42.169 --> 01:43:42.179 align:start position:0%
graduate student but an undergraduate
 
01:43:43.790 --> 01:43:43.800 align:start position:0%
student you can present to the head of
 
01:43:46.070 --> 01:43:46.080 align:start position:0%
NASA about
 
01:43:48.050 --> 01:43:48.060 align:start position:0%
space plasma and other things that I
 
01:43:49.910 --> 01:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
don't understand I think it's pretty
 
01:43:51.410 --> 01:43:51.420 align:start position:0%
great so that really does attract we
 
01:43:53.149 --> 01:43:53.159 align:start position:0%
just got a big Grant on Space plasma so
 
01:43:54.410 --> 01:43:54.420 align:start position:0%
I can't wait to have them explain to me
 
01:43:56.629 --> 01:43:56.639 align:start position:0%
what exactly it is I'm all for it
 
01:43:58.970 --> 01:43:58.980 align:start position:0%
because it was 250 million dollars so it
 
01:44:00.290 --> 01:44:00.300 align:start position:0%
must be good
 
01:44:02.930 --> 01:44:02.940 align:start position:0%
so so there's that
 
01:44:05.209 --> 01:44:05.219 align:start position:0%
um you know because you have some
 
01:44:07.430 --> 01:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
background in this that universities are
 
01:44:08.390 --> 01:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
really a collection of different
 
01:44:09.830 --> 01:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
disciplines and it would be a different
 
01:44:12.770 --> 01:44:12.780 align:start position:0%
answer for for each discipline
 
01:44:15.590 --> 01:44:15.600 align:start position:0%
um I'll by coincidence pick music and
 
01:44:17.870 --> 01:44:17.880 align:start position:0%
music education we have a great
 
01:44:19.850 --> 01:44:19.860 align:start position:0%
reputation in there many of the music
 
01:44:22.490 --> 01:44:22.500 align:start position:0%
teachers across the state of New
 
01:44:24.770 --> 01:44:24.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire come from from the system
 
01:44:26.990 --> 01:44:27.000 align:start position:0%
because keen and Plymouth both also have
 
01:44:29.090 --> 01:44:29.100 align:start position:0%
really strong music education programs
 
01:44:31.970 --> 01:44:31.980 align:start position:0%
we do as well and I think that's
 
01:44:34.370 --> 01:44:34.380 align:start position:0%
something to be proud of when I when I
 
01:44:35.390 --> 01:44:35.400 align:start position:0%
think of
 
01:44:38.030 --> 01:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
of the kids learning about music and
 
01:44:39.410 --> 01:44:39.420 align:start position:0%
what that means learning to play an
 
01:44:41.090 --> 01:44:41.100 align:start position:0%
instrument or learning about different
 
01:44:43.070 --> 01:44:43.080 align:start position:0%
kinds of music I'm just really proud
 
01:44:44.689 --> 01:44:44.699 align:start position:0%
that we play a role in that I mean you
 
01:44:47.149 --> 01:44:47.159 align:start position:0%
don't make really much money being a
 
01:44:49.910 --> 01:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
music teacher but you're doing really
 
01:44:51.410 --> 01:44:51.420 align:start position:0%
important work
 
01:44:53.450 --> 01:44:53.460 align:start position:0%
I would say you know to take the broader
 
01:44:57.290 --> 01:44:57.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:00.590 --> 01:45:00.600 align:start position:0%
we do not have we have never had a very
 
01:45:03.470 --> 01:45:03.480 align:start position:0%
big marketing budget at the University
 
01:45:05.810 --> 01:45:05.820 align:start position:0%
um in fact
 
01:45:09.890 --> 01:45:09.900 align:start position:0%
the the marketing budget for uh
 
01:45:11.510 --> 01:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
University of Southern New Hampshire
 
01:45:14.330 --> 01:45:14.340 align:start position:0%
dwarfs hours which is why they have TV
 
01:45:15.830 --> 01:45:15.840 align:start position:0%
ads in a bus that runs around the
 
01:45:20.330 --> 01:45:20.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:22.970 --> 01:45:22.980 align:start position:0%
in fact their their budget I believe in
 
01:45:24.649 --> 01:45:24.659 align:start position:0%
the hundreds of millions of dollars just
 
01:45:26.510 --> 01:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
for marketing so we're not going to do
 
01:45:28.189 --> 01:45:28.199 align:start position:0%
that we're a public university having
 
01:45:31.010 --> 01:45:31.020 align:start position:0%
said that we've recently recognized that
 
01:45:33.470 --> 01:45:33.480 align:start position:0%
we in a competitive industry and Kathy's
 
01:45:34.970 --> 01:45:34.980 align:start position:0%
talked about this that we need to do a
 
01:45:37.669 --> 01:45:37.679 align:start position:0%
better job of getting our message out so
 
01:45:39.970 --> 01:45:39.980 align:start position:0%
we have done a couple of things we have
 
01:45:42.229 --> 01:45:42.239 align:start position:0%
communications and marketing person at
 
01:45:44.450 --> 01:45:44.460 align:start position:0%
the system and we've recently hired a
 
01:45:46.129 --> 01:45:46.139 align:start position:0%
senior person marketing at the
 
01:45:48.910 --> 01:45:48.920 align:start position:0%
University of of New Hampshire
 
01:45:51.290 --> 01:45:51.300 align:start position:0%
and interestingly while you would think
 
01:45:53.090 --> 01:45:53.100 align:start position:0%
marketing is about driving Revenue which
 
01:45:54.669 --> 01:45:54.679 align:start position:0%
of course it is
 
01:45:57.350 --> 01:45:57.360 align:start position:0%
our new director of marketing has also
 
01:45:59.810 --> 01:45:59.820 align:start position:0%
said that we're not spending money as
 
01:46:01.729 --> 01:46:01.739 align:start position:0%
intelligently as we could and so we're
 
01:46:03.649 --> 01:46:03.659 align:start position:0%
consolidating media buys and the kinds
 
01:46:04.910 --> 01:46:04.920 align:start position:0%
of things that Professionals in that
 
01:46:06.709 --> 01:46:06.719 align:start position:0%
area do which will both Drive revenue
 
01:46:08.810 --> 01:46:08.820 align:start position:0%
and reduce cost and get our reputation
 
01:46:12.470 --> 01:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
out there a bit more sorry long answer
 
01:46:14.149 --> 01:46:14.159 align:start position:0%
I just want to share a thought that I
 
01:46:17.030 --> 01:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned to Kathy last week is that my
 
01:46:19.310 --> 01:46:19.320 align:start position:0%
sister lives in Colorado
 
01:46:21.470 --> 01:46:21.480 align:start position:0%
and she thinks that the Southern New
 
01:46:25.250 --> 01:46:25.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire University ads are for unh
 
01:46:27.290 --> 01:46:27.300 align:start position:0%
just well as long as she sends someone
 
01:46:30.950 --> 01:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
to UNH I think that's perfectly fine
 
01:46:35.990 --> 01:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
I mean it is SN uh versus usnh there's I
 
01:46:39.890 --> 01:46:39.900 align:start position:0%
still get the USPS confused with UPS so
 
01:46:42.830 --> 01:46:42.840 align:start position:0%
but um I was at this is you reminded me
 
01:46:44.990 --> 01:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
of something I was completely thrown off
 
01:46:47.510 --> 01:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
my feet when I was hurt told that the
 
01:46:50.270 --> 01:46:50.280 align:start position:0%
development department at Ohio State
 
01:46:53.030 --> 01:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
University employs 600 people
 
01:46:57.890 --> 01:46:57.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:57.900 --> 01:46:59.209 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:46:59.209 --> 01:46:59.219 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:46:59.219 --> 01:46:59.810 align:start position:0%
okay
um

01:46:59.810 --> 01:46:59.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:03.530 --> 01:47:03.540 align:start position:0%
it's it's less than six but thanks for
 
01:47:03.540 --> 01:47:05.870 align:start position:0%
it's it's less than six but thanks for
that

01:47:05.870 --> 01:47:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:09.649 --> 01:47:09.659 align:start position:0%
it's uh so we have at there are very few
 
01:47:11.330 --> 01:47:11.340 align:start position:0%
people in developmented either Keen or
 
01:47:12.950 --> 01:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
Plymouth fewer than 10 in both places
 
01:47:16.310 --> 01:47:16.320 align:start position:0%
UNH has a much bigger uh department and
 
01:47:17.689 --> 01:47:17.699 align:start position:0%
the overall department is called
 
01:47:19.430 --> 01:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
advancement that's the term of art
 
01:47:21.890 --> 01:47:21.900 align:start position:0%
they're using these days and fundraising
 
01:47:23.750 --> 01:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
or development is a part of that but
 
01:47:25.910 --> 01:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
also alumni relations is a part of that
 
01:47:28.250 --> 01:47:28.260 align:start position:0%
and event management is a part of that
 
01:47:31.669 --> 01:47:31.679 align:start position:0%
as well I would say we have a few dozen
 
01:47:34.729 --> 01:47:34.739 align:start position:0%
and sort of that but I will say
 
01:47:38.689 --> 01:47:38.699 align:start position:0%
uh that that is an area where we have
 
01:47:41.030 --> 01:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
been growing so uh the head of
 
01:47:44.209 --> 01:47:44.219 align:start position:0%
advancement reports to me and she has
 
01:47:47.450 --> 01:47:47.460 align:start position:0%
told me that once a development officer
 
01:47:50.090 --> 01:47:50.100 align:start position:0%
is up to speed that he or she will
 
01:47:51.950 --> 01:47:51.960 align:start position:0%
generate as much as two million dollars
 
01:47:53.629 --> 01:47:53.639 align:start position:0%
in Revenue
 
01:47:55.430 --> 01:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
um they're paid
 
01:47:57.649 --> 01:47:57.659 align:start position:0%
nowhere near that there's more than a 20
 
01:47:59.990 --> 01:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
to 1 return on investment for that and
 
01:48:02.930 --> 01:48:02.940 align:start position:0%
our numbers uh of fundraising have gone
 
01:48:04.910 --> 01:48:04.920 align:start position:0%
up every year for the last probably 10
 
01:48:04.920 --> 01:48:07.490 align:start position:0%
up every year for the last probably 10
years

01:48:07.490 --> 01:48:07.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:09.530 --> 01:48:09.540 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:48:09.540 --> 01:48:10.250 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

01:48:10.250 --> 01:48:10.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:12.590 --> 01:48:12.600 align:start position:0%
the reason Southern New Hampshire is so
 
01:48:14.209 --> 01:48:14.219 align:start position:0%
successful is because they're online
 
01:48:17.090 --> 01:48:17.100 align:start position:0%
courses do you plan to go uh that
 
01:48:21.109 --> 01:48:21.119 align:start position:0%
pathway at all yes we we already offer
 
01:48:23.270 --> 01:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
quite a number of online courses and
 
01:48:24.830 --> 01:48:24.840 align:start position:0%
both the number of courses and the
 
01:48:26.330 --> 01:48:26.340 align:start position:0%
enrollment have really increased pretty
 
01:48:28.149 --> 01:48:28.159 align:start position:0%
dramatically over the past few years
 
01:48:31.609 --> 01:48:31.619 align:start position:0%
it's interesting and if I'm too far in
 
01:48:34.129 --> 01:48:34.139 align:start position:0%
the weeds pull me back but the the
 
01:48:37.370 --> 01:48:37.380 align:start position:0%
market for online courses is mostly at
 
01:48:39.109 --> 01:48:39.119 align:start position:0%
the Master's Degree level that's really
 
01:48:41.510 --> 01:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
the big area of growth there are not
 
01:48:43.550 --> 01:48:43.560 align:start position:0%
that many undergraduate students who are
 
01:48:45.890 --> 01:48:45.900 align:start position:0%
interested in having a fully online
 
01:48:49.310 --> 01:48:49.320 align:start position:0%
experience many of the people who go to
 
01:48:51.290 --> 01:48:51.300 align:start position:0%
Southern New Hampshire are so-called
 
01:48:53.149 --> 01:48:53.159 align:start position:0%
degree completers they're people who
 
01:48:54.530 --> 01:48:54.540 align:start position:0%
have some college and they want to
 
01:48:56.510 --> 01:48:56.520 align:start position:0%
finish that's a really great market and
 
01:48:57.709 --> 01:48:57.719 align:start position:0%
they've done you know I think they're
 
01:48:59.149 --> 01:48:59.159 align:start position:0%
very they're playing an important Niche
 
01:49:02.270 --> 01:49:02.280 align:start position:0%
I will say just for your purposes since
 
01:49:03.590 --> 01:49:03.600 align:start position:0%
you are helping to fund the university
 
01:49:06.770 --> 01:49:06.780 align:start position:0%
system that the tuition at the
 
01:49:09.229 --> 01:49:09.239 align:start position:0%
University of Southern New Hampshire is
 
01:49:11.810 --> 01:49:11.820 align:start position:0%
much higher than our tuition and their
 
01:49:14.090 --> 01:49:14.100 align:start position:0%
success rate of successful graduation is
 
01:49:16.129 --> 01:49:16.139 align:start position:0%
much much lower
 
01:49:18.530 --> 01:49:18.540 align:start position:0%
so you're paying more for something that
 
01:49:20.149 --> 01:49:20.159 align:start position:0%
is much less likely to get you a degree
 
01:49:26.950 --> 01:49:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:29.510 --> 01:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'm probably going to
 
01:49:31.370 --> 01:49:31.380 align:start position:0%
make Kathy cringe but
 
01:49:34.850 --> 01:49:34.860 align:start position:0%
I'm going to say this piece that College
 
01:49:37.250 --> 01:49:37.260 align:start position:0%
tuition loans
 
01:49:39.830 --> 01:49:39.840 align:start position:0%
are the source of our latest demographic
 
01:49:42.709 --> 01:49:42.719 align:start position:0%
trend where are the young people
 
01:49:45.470 --> 01:49:45.480 align:start position:0%
well the people that made the tuition
 
01:49:47.510 --> 01:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
loan so they could move safely into the
 
01:49:50.149 --> 01:49:50.159 align:start position:0%
middle class find they have such a
 
01:49:52.070 --> 01:49:52.080 align:start position:0%
burden they can't afford to get married
 
01:49:53.990 --> 01:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes they can't afford a house and
 
01:49:55.129 --> 01:49:55.139 align:start position:0%
they certainly can't afford to have
 
01:49:58.129 --> 01:49:58.139 align:start position:0%
children in many cases so where are all
 
01:50:01.250 --> 01:50:01.260 align:start position:0%
the 18 year olds that generation didn't
 
01:50:04.310 --> 01:50:04.320 align:start position:0%
have them and I remember 30 years ago my
 
01:50:06.530 --> 01:50:06.540 align:start position:0%
daughter was in college I was paying and
 
01:50:09.109 --> 01:50:09.119 align:start position:0%
she's telling me about classmates going
 
01:50:11.090 --> 01:50:11.100 align:start position:0%
to borrow six hundred dollars on the
 
01:50:14.209 --> 01:50:14.219 align:start position:0%
line of credit to go on spring break
 
01:50:17.330 --> 01:50:17.340 align:start position:0%
I mean you need to have a class in
 
01:50:20.629 --> 01:50:20.639 align:start position:0%
financial responsibility and planning
 
01:50:22.370 --> 01:50:22.380 align:start position:0%
before you can go and get a hundred
 
01:50:24.229 --> 01:50:24.239 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars worth of student loans
 
01:50:25.729 --> 01:50:25.739 align:start position:0%
if you want
 
01:50:27.890 --> 01:50:27.900 align:start position:0%
I've got some detail on this as well
 
01:50:29.750 --> 01:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
thank you we've had this the station for
 
01:50:31.970 --> 01:50:31.980 align:start position:0%
your question representative I would say
 
01:50:34.310 --> 01:50:34.320 align:start position:0%
financial literacy should start well
 
01:50:37.250 --> 01:50:37.260 align:start position:0%
before someone is in college yes when I
 
01:50:39.770 --> 01:50:39.780 align:start position:0%
was State Treasurer I advocated for that
 
01:50:42.830 --> 01:50:42.840 align:start position:0%
at the high school level and it didn't
 
01:50:46.010 --> 01:50:46.020 align:start position:0%
go very far so I would also Point your
 
01:50:50.450 --> 01:50:50.460 align:start position:0%
attention to page 19 we provided some
 
01:50:54.010 --> 01:50:54.020 align:start position:0%
um outcome data on the University system
 
01:50:58.010 --> 01:50:58.020 align:start position:0%
and the university system has the lowest
 
01:51:00.890 --> 01:51:00.900 align:start position:0%
student loan default rate
 
01:51:00.900 --> 01:51:01.490 align:start position:0%
student loan default rate
um

01:51:01.490 --> 01:51:01.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:03.590 --> 01:51:03.600 align:start position:0%
actually pretty much across the country
 
01:51:06.109 --> 01:51:06.119 align:start position:0%
and what that tells and
 
01:51:09.350 --> 01:51:09.360 align:start position:0%
our graduation rate compared to other
 
01:51:11.689 --> 01:51:11.699 align:start position:0%
publics in New England is the highest
 
01:51:13.310 --> 01:51:13.320 align:start position:0%
that tells us
 
01:51:14.990 --> 01:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
that we have
 
01:51:17.750 --> 01:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
programs where people are graduating on
 
01:51:20.030 --> 01:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
time they're able to pay down their
 
01:51:20.040 --> 01:51:21.430 align:start position:0%
time they're able to pay down their
debts

01:51:21.430 --> 01:51:21.440 align:start position:0%
debts
 
01:51:23.689 --> 01:51:23.699 align:start position:0%
they've made an investment they're
 
01:51:25.030 --> 01:51:25.040 align:start position:0%
paying it off
 
01:51:28.370 --> 01:51:28.380 align:start position:0%
again part of our problem is the ability
 
01:51:30.430 --> 01:51:30.440 align:start position:0%
to compete on price
 
01:51:33.350 --> 01:51:33.360 align:start position:0%
and now you're going to cringe
 
01:51:36.290 --> 01:51:36.300 align:start position:0%
representative when I say this
 
01:51:39.109 --> 01:51:39.119 align:start position:0%
and that for New Hampshire residents is
 
01:51:40.609 --> 01:51:40.619 align:start position:0%
directly related to the amount of State
 
01:51:41.990 --> 01:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
support that the university system
 
01:51:45.169 --> 01:51:45.179 align:start position:0%
receives congratulations
 
01:51:46.430 --> 01:51:46.440 align:start position:0%
it was just how she was going to get
 
01:51:47.750 --> 01:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
there it wasn't whether she was going to
 
01:51:48.649 --> 01:51:48.659 align:start position:0%
get there
 
01:51:50.450 --> 01:51:50.460 align:start position:0%
um just just some a little broader
 
01:51:52.129 --> 01:51:52.139 align:start position:0%
answer on debt as long as we're talking
 
01:51:54.530 --> 01:51:54.540 align:start position:0%
about that so Kathy made the point that
 
01:51:56.030 --> 01:51:56.040 align:start position:0%
I wanted to make which is that our our
 
01:51:58.070 --> 01:51:58.080 align:start position:0%
debt repayment rate is is actually
 
01:51:59.570 --> 01:51:59.580 align:start position:0%
really good but just for general
 
01:52:01.010 --> 01:52:01.020 align:start position:0%
information because people talk about
 
01:52:03.410 --> 01:52:03.420 align:start position:0%
college debt a lot uh get in your mind
 
01:52:05.750 --> 01:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
what you think is the average amount of
 
01:52:07.550 --> 01:52:07.560 align:start position:0%
debt that college graduates have
 
01:52:09.649 --> 01:52:09.659 align:start position:0%
currently just think of a number in your
 
01:52:09.659 --> 01:52:11.450 align:start position:0%
currently just think of a number in your
mind

01:52:11.450 --> 01:52:11.460 align:start position:0%
mind
 
01:52:14.810 --> 01:52:14.820 align:start position:0%
yeah what'd you say 40.
 
01:52:18.350 --> 01:52:18.360 align:start position:0%
yeah so it's so the app the average is
 
01:52:20.810 --> 01:52:20.820 align:start position:0%
thirty thousand uh nationally the
 
01:52:22.850 --> 01:52:22.860 align:start position:0%
average is thirty thousand and that
 
01:52:24.590 --> 01:52:24.600 align:start position:0%
includes this is a really important part
 
01:52:27.109 --> 01:52:27.119 align:start position:0%
that includes both graduate school debt
 
01:52:29.090 --> 01:52:29.100 align:start position:0%
as well as undergraduate debt the
 
01:52:30.950 --> 01:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
majority of debt is actually held by
 
01:52:32.209 --> 01:52:32.219 align:start position:0%
people who go to graduate school
 
01:52:34.250 --> 01:52:34.260 align:start position:0%
including business school like some of
 
01:52:36.890 --> 01:52:36.900 align:start position:0%
you in this room medical school and law
 
01:52:38.810 --> 01:52:38.820 align:start position:0%
school and if you take that out the
 
01:52:40.209 --> 01:52:40.219 align:start position:0%
average is actually quite a bit lower
 
01:52:42.770 --> 01:52:42.780 align:start position:0%
also a lot of the debt is held by
 
01:52:44.750 --> 01:52:44.760 align:start position:0%
individuals who go to not-for-profit
 
01:52:46.790 --> 01:52:46.800 align:start position:0%
institutions as opposed to excuse me
 
01:52:48.950 --> 01:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
for-profit institutions as opposed to
 
01:52:52.310 --> 01:52:52.320 align:start position:0%
non-profit so it is a problem but it's a
 
01:52:54.169 --> 01:52:54.179 align:start position:0%
different problem than people think
 
01:52:56.990 --> 01:52:57.000 align:start position:0%
um my daughter got an MBA
 
01:52:59.390 --> 01:52:59.400 align:start position:0%
I suppose predictably enough and she
 
01:53:01.129 --> 01:53:01.139 align:start position:0%
spent a bunch of money to do it but she
 
01:53:02.570 --> 01:53:02.580 align:start position:0%
got a job that allows her to pay it back
 
01:53:04.970 --> 01:53:04.980 align:start position:0%
that's okay if you saw the series of
 
01:53:06.550 --> 01:53:06.560 align:start position:0%
Wall Street Journal articles about this
 
01:53:09.830 --> 01:53:09.840 align:start position:0%
uh over the last year you'd see that one
 
01:53:11.149 --> 01:53:11.159 align:start position:0%
of the big challenges is people getting
 
01:53:13.010 --> 01:53:13.020 align:start position:0%
master's degrees and paying two hundred
 
01:53:14.870 --> 01:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars for the degree and then
 
01:53:16.550 --> 01:53:16.560 align:start position:0%
earning forty thousand dollars a year
 
01:53:18.350 --> 01:53:18.360 align:start position:0%
there's no planet on which that makes
 
01:53:20.930 --> 01:53:20.940 align:start position:0%
any sense and and I will say that the
 
01:53:22.250 --> 01:53:22.260 align:start position:0%
most elite schools in the country are
 
01:53:24.709 --> 01:53:24.719 align:start position:0%
some of the worst offenders
 
01:53:27.709 --> 01:53:27.719 align:start position:0%
yeah you can look up Melissa corn Korn
 
01:53:29.750 --> 01:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
wrote a series of articles about this
 
01:53:31.010 --> 01:53:31.020 align:start position:0%
for the Wall Street Journal really
 
01:53:34.310 --> 01:53:34.320 align:start position:0%
insightful thank you
 
01:53:36.410 --> 01:53:36.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:53:38.510 --> 01:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
um on the chart that they referred on
 
01:53:40.669 --> 01:53:40.679 align:start position:0%
page 19 there is that you know fine
 
01:53:42.470 --> 01:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
print on the bottom which is perfectly
 
01:53:44.930 --> 01:53:44.940 align:start position:0%
accurate that the current low default
 
01:53:46.370 --> 01:53:46.380 align:start position:0%
rates are because of a lot of
 
01:53:48.590 --> 01:53:48.600 align:start position:0%
moratoriums and whatnot would you be
 
01:53:50.689 --> 01:53:50.699 align:start position:0%
able you know after this to maybe send
 
01:53:53.030 --> 01:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
us a chart from before kovid because
 
01:53:54.950 --> 01:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
that would be a bit more representative
 
01:53:57.950 --> 01:53:57.960 align:start position:0%
in terms of the you know data absolutely
 
01:54:00.410 --> 01:54:00.420 align:start position:0%
and we've been on the bottom of this
 
01:54:02.870 --> 01:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
chart since I arrived so I will
 
01:54:04.490 --> 01:54:04.500 align:start position:0%
definitely get that information I'm sure
 
01:54:06.109 --> 01:54:06.119 align:start position:0%
you are but I want to see how much
 
01:54:08.450 --> 01:54:08.460 align:start position:0%
further behind everybody else we get and
 
01:54:10.129 --> 01:54:10.139 align:start position:0%
the other question was a bit earlier
 
01:54:11.330 --> 01:54:11.340 align:start position:0%
when we were talking about online
 
01:54:13.370 --> 01:54:13.380 align:start position:0%
programs and I was mentioning in the
 
01:54:16.189 --> 01:54:16.199 align:start position:0%
early discussion with ccsnh that I had
 
01:54:19.790 --> 01:54:19.800 align:start position:0%
to get some accounting credits after I
 
01:54:22.070 --> 01:54:22.080 align:start position:0%
graduated to meet the requirements for
 
01:54:25.070 --> 01:54:25.080 align:start position:0%
my CPA and I took remote learning
 
01:54:26.990 --> 01:54:27.000 align:start position:0%
classes with like LSU where it was
 
01:54:28.550 --> 01:54:28.560 align:start position:0%
literally you got the books and then you
 
01:54:30.410 --> 01:54:30.420 align:start position:0%
had to study and you could ask minimal
 
01:54:32.090 --> 01:54:32.100 align:start position:0%
questions and then you had to have a
 
01:54:33.950 --> 01:54:33.960 align:start position:0%
proctored exam to you know great get
 
01:54:35.030 --> 01:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
your grade
 
01:54:37.189 --> 01:54:37.199 align:start position:0%
I'm completely unaware of whether a UNH
 
01:54:39.470 --> 01:54:39.480 align:start position:0%
does anything like that or not and I
 
01:54:40.609 --> 01:54:40.619 align:start position:0%
would just appreciate a bit of
 
01:54:42.169 --> 01:54:42.179 align:start position:0%
background it's not going to be a
 
01:54:44.270 --> 01:54:44.280 align:start position:0%
critical thing but just curiosity and
 
01:54:46.430 --> 01:54:46.440 align:start position:0%
trying to see the full picture
 
01:54:49.010 --> 01:54:49.020 align:start position:0%
so yes we do an awful lot in that area
 
01:54:50.870 --> 01:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
and it's been growing quite a bit and
 
01:54:51.890 --> 01:54:51.900 align:start position:0%
and the kind of thing you're talking
 
01:54:53.510 --> 01:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
about is right down the middle of what
 
01:54:56.510 --> 01:54:56.520 align:start position:0%
education is in 2023 we'll get you some
 
01:54:59.030 --> 01:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
statistics on that thank you it's large
 
01:55:02.149 --> 01:55:02.159 align:start position:0%
and growing I just want to have you to
 
01:55:04.189 --> 01:55:04.199 align:start position:0%
have an opportunity so when you leave
 
01:55:06.890 --> 01:55:06.900 align:start position:0%
here we'll know what your expectation
 
01:55:08.750 --> 01:55:08.760 align:start position:0%
would be if we could satisfy all your
 
01:55:11.930 --> 01:55:11.940 align:start position:0%
all your expectations
 
01:55:14.390 --> 01:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
because right now I I see a five million
 
01:55:17.990 --> 01:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
dollar Delta in the budgeted items and
 
01:55:19.550 --> 01:55:19.560 align:start position:0%
then you've got these other items that
 
01:55:23.090 --> 01:55:23.100 align:start position:0%
are I'm assuming are hopefully in hb2
 
01:55:25.250 --> 01:55:25.260 align:start position:0%
have we covered everything so that if
 
01:55:27.890 --> 01:55:27.900 align:start position:0%
yes representative but but if you could
 
01:55:30.050 --> 01:55:30.060 align:start position:0%
satisfy if this committee can satisfy
 
01:55:32.870 --> 01:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
all of our expectations and needs it
 
01:55:33.970 --> 01:55:33.980 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:55:36.890 --> 01:55:36.900 align:start position:0%
199.4 million dollars in an operating
 
01:55:39.350 --> 01:55:39.360 align:start position:0%
Grant over the biennium in house bill
 
01:55:42.290 --> 01:55:42.300 align:start position:0%
one plus eight million dollars for the
 
01:55:44.209 --> 01:55:44.219 align:start position:0%
Whittemore Center and a million and a
 
01:55:46.209 --> 01:55:46.219 align:start position:0%
half dollars for the interoperability
 
01:55:49.129 --> 01:55:49.139 align:start position:0%
it's called the cryptocurrency quality
 
01:55:51.109 --> 01:55:51.119 align:start position:0%
assurance Center
 
01:55:53.510 --> 01:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
um that's in-house Bill too now again if
 
01:55:55.010 --> 01:55:55.020 align:start position:0%
there's conversation about changing the
 
01:55:57.050 --> 01:55:57.060 align:start position:0%
way House Bill 25 works that's fine too
 
01:56:09.050 --> 01:56:09.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:11.090 --> 01:56:11.100 align:start position:0%
I get the point the governor made a
 
01:56:13.729 --> 01:56:13.739 align:start position:0%
point in hb2 that's he's considering a
 
01:56:15.649 --> 01:56:15.659 align:start position:0%
surplus fund so he wants a straight pay
 
01:56:17.990 --> 01:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
rather than going to one that gets
 
01:56:21.290 --> 01:56:21.300 align:start position:0%
bonded so now I I remember the way he
 
01:56:24.530 --> 01:56:24.540 align:start position:0%
emphasized it thank you okay if you
 
01:56:26.209 --> 01:56:26.219 align:start position:0%
folks had some follow-up questions I
 
01:56:27.530 --> 01:56:27.540 align:start position:0%
just wanted to make you aware when I
 
01:56:28.910 --> 01:56:28.920 align:start position:0%
when Tom and I were here last Thursday
 
01:56:32.090 --> 01:56:32.100 align:start position:0%
in one of the appendices we've added
 
01:56:34.970 --> 01:56:34.980 align:start position:0%
um some answers to those questions
 
01:56:36.290 --> 01:56:36.300 align:start position:0%
um I just got some demographic
 
01:56:37.970 --> 01:56:37.980 align:start position:0%
information this morning I can follow up
 
01:56:39.830 --> 01:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
with that but some of the answers to
 
01:56:41.090 --> 01:56:41.100 align:start position:0%
your questions you can find in the
 
01:56:42.890 --> 01:56:42.900 align:start position:0%
appendix to this this morning's
 
01:56:45.709 --> 01:56:45.719 align:start position:0%
information I have a question yes I I
 
01:56:47.870 --> 01:56:47.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:56:50.750 --> 01:56:50.760 align:start position:0%
um endowments and how much effect does
 
01:56:54.890 --> 01:56:54.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:58.609 --> 01:56:58.619 align:start position:0%
okay so if you go to page 26 here we go
 
01:57:00.290 --> 01:57:00.300 align:start position:0%
you asked this question last week
 
01:57:02.270 --> 01:57:02.280 align:start position:0%
representative thank you
 
01:57:05.570 --> 01:57:05.580 align:start position:0%
um the
 
01:57:08.810 --> 01:57:08.820 align:start position:0%
well it's that on the right side of that
 
01:57:08.820 --> 01:57:10.010 align:start position:0%
well it's that on the right side of that
page

01:57:10.010 --> 01:57:10.020 align:start position:0%
page
 
01:57:13.370 --> 01:57:13.380 align:start position:0%
six mil 6.2 million dollars is going to
 
01:57:13.380 --> 01:57:14.870 align:start position:0%
six mil 6.2 million dollars is going to
scholarship

01:57:14.870 --> 01:57:14.880 align:start position:0%
scholarship
 
01:57:17.750 --> 01:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
for the um
 
01:57:20.149 --> 01:57:20.159 align:start position:0%
the University Systems part of the
 
01:57:20.159 --> 01:57:21.470 align:start position:0%
the University Systems part of the
endowment

01:57:21.470 --> 01:57:21.480 align:start position:0%
endowment
 
01:57:21.480 --> 01:57:22.729 align:start position:0%
endowment
um

01:57:22.729 --> 01:57:22.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:25.370 --> 01:57:25.380 align:start position:0%
there's another piece of this though
 
01:57:27.589 --> 01:57:27.599 align:start position:0%
that there are two endowments the
 
01:57:29.390 --> 01:57:29.400 align:start position:0%
University of New Hampshire has its own
 
01:57:30.649 --> 01:57:30.659 align:start position:0%
foundation and then the university
 
01:57:34.370 --> 01:57:34.380 align:start position:0%
system so it it's probably more around
 
01:57:36.350 --> 01:57:36.360 align:start position:0%
10 million dollars it goes to
 
01:57:38.450 --> 01:57:38.460 align:start position:0%
scholarships from
 
01:57:41.149 --> 01:57:41.159 align:start position:0%
restricted endowments every year and
 
01:57:43.790 --> 01:57:43.800 align:start position:0%
endowments sorry in terms of
 
01:57:45.490 --> 01:57:45.500 align:start position:0%
philanthropic gifts to the university
 
01:57:48.649 --> 01:57:48.659 align:start position:0%
the number one by far Target for
 
01:57:50.750 --> 01:57:50.760 align:start position:0%
philanthropic gifts is scholarships that
 
01:57:52.609 --> 01:57:52.619 align:start position:0%
when we go out to donors that's what we
 
01:57:54.890 --> 01:57:54.900 align:start position:0%
ask for make it easier for the kids to
 
01:57:57.410 --> 01:57:57.420 align:start position:0%
be able to afford college and and it's a
 
01:57:58.669 --> 01:57:58.679 align:start position:0%
I don't want to say it's an easy sell
 
01:58:00.830 --> 01:58:00.840 align:start position:0%
but it's a relatively easy sell people
 
01:58:02.330 --> 01:58:02.340 align:start position:0%
want to make it easier for kids to be
 
01:58:03.350 --> 01:58:03.360 align:start position:0%
able to go
 
01:58:05.870 --> 01:58:05.880 align:start position:0%
the other um and you're probably all
 
01:58:07.870 --> 01:58:07.880 align:start position:0%
well aware of this the other thing about
 
01:58:10.490 --> 01:58:10.500 align:start position:0%
endowments is that these scholarships
 
01:58:14.510 --> 01:58:14.520 align:start position:0%
are derived from earnings on the the
 
01:58:16.490 --> 01:58:16.500 align:start position:0%
dollars that a donor gives so it's
 
01:58:18.410 --> 01:58:18.420 align:start position:0%
called payout to purpose we call it
 
01:58:20.510 --> 01:58:20.520 align:start position:0%
payout purpose and so
 
01:58:23.990 --> 01:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
about four and a half percent
 
01:58:26.930 --> 01:58:26.940 align:start position:0%
gets paid out to purpose
 
01:58:30.430 --> 01:58:30.440 align:start position:0%
on an annual basis based on the
 
01:58:33.229 --> 01:58:33.239 align:start position:0%
12-month rolling fair market value of
 
01:58:37.430 --> 01:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:39.709 --> 01:58:39.719 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and again thank you
 
01:58:41.990 --> 01:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
for taking the many questions if you
 
01:58:44.510 --> 01:58:44.520 align:start position:0%
look on your slide 24 you know the
 
01:58:46.490 --> 01:58:46.500 align:start position:0%
reward for answering a question from
 
01:58:48.229 --> 01:58:48.239 align:start position:0%
last week is that you get more questions
 
01:58:48.239 --> 01:58:49.850 align:start position:0%
last week is that you get more questions
asked

01:58:49.850 --> 01:58:49.860 align:start position:0%
asked
 
01:58:52.550 --> 01:58:52.560 align:start position:0%
um you are pointing out the number of
 
01:58:54.229 --> 01:58:54.239 align:start position:0%
graduates that they enrolled out of
 
01:58:55.790 --> 01:58:55.800 align:start position:0%
state and we were talking earlier about
 
01:58:57.649 --> 01:58:57.659 align:start position:0%
the graduation rates of the ones that
 
01:58:59.930 --> 01:58:59.940 align:start position:0%
stay in state do we have any data on the
 
01:59:02.930 --> 01:59:02.940 align:start position:0%
graduation rates of the New Hampshire
 
01:59:05.149 --> 01:59:05.159 align:start position:0%
high school graduates that go to out of
 
01:59:06.830 --> 01:59:06.840 align:start position:0%
state schools I understand that may be
 
01:59:08.689 --> 01:59:08.699 align:start position:0%
very tough to put together but do we
 
01:59:10.430 --> 01:59:10.440 align:start position:0%
have anything so I don't have graduation
 
01:59:12.589 --> 01:59:12.599 align:start position:0%
rates but I just got this this morning
 
01:59:14.689 --> 01:59:14.699 align:start position:0%
specific to your question last week
 
01:59:17.750 --> 01:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
about well has humane's strategy been
 
01:59:17.760 --> 01:59:20.510 align:start position:0%
about well has humane's strategy been
effective

01:59:20.510 --> 01:59:20.520 align:start position:0%
effective
 
01:59:24.290 --> 01:59:24.300 align:start position:0%
61 now the numbers aren't giant but 61
 
01:59:24.300 --> 01:59:25.850 align:start position:0%
61 now the numbers aren't giant but 61
percent

01:59:25.850 --> 01:59:25.860 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:59:28.310 --> 01:59:28.320 align:start position:0%
increase in the number of our New
 
01:59:28.320 --> 01:59:29.450 align:start position:0%
increase in the number of our New
Hampshire

01:59:29.450 --> 01:59:29.460 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:59:32.510 --> 01:59:32.520 align:start position:0%
High School grads
 
01:59:37.370 --> 01:59:37.380 align:start position:0%
went to UMaine in 2020 compared to 2010.
 
01:59:40.430 --> 01:59:40.440 align:start position:0%
again the numbers aren't really big
 
01:59:43.850 --> 01:59:43.860 align:start position:0%
it's about you know 40 more students but
 
01:59:46.970 --> 01:59:46.980 align:start position:0%
I'll tell you 40 New Hampshire students
 
01:59:51.290 --> 01:59:51.300 align:start position:0%
in the system of our size matters so I
 
01:59:52.729 --> 01:59:52.739 align:start position:0%
would conclude based on this information
 
01:59:55.370 --> 01:59:55.380 align:start position:0%
that UMaine strategy has been effective
 
01:59:57.350 --> 01:59:57.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for the follow-up appreciate
 
01:59:57.360 --> 02:00:00.530 align:start position:0%
thank you for the follow-up appreciate
it

02:00:00.530 --> 02:00:00.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:03.169 --> 02:00:03.179 align:start position:0%
I know with um donor advice funds
 
02:00:04.609 --> 02:00:04.619 align:start position:0%
sometimes you get into a pickle because
 
02:00:06.470 --> 02:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
they're too restricted to you know
 
02:00:08.570 --> 02:00:08.580 align:start position:0%
blue-eyed Lithuanian who wants to study
 
02:00:10.129 --> 02:00:10.139 align:start position:0%
you know something
 
02:00:12.410 --> 02:00:12.420 align:start position:0%
um well some of your scholarships go
 
02:00:12.420 --> 02:00:13.370 align:start position:0%
um well some of your scholarships go
back

02:00:13.370 --> 02:00:13.380 align:start position:0%
back
 
02:00:14.689 --> 02:00:14.699 align:start position:0%
um quite a ways have you run into
 
02:00:16.910 --> 02:00:16.920 align:start position:0%
problems with scholarships that have
 
02:00:18.589 --> 02:00:18.599 align:start position:0%
been too restrictive or even a
 
02:00:20.629 --> 02:00:20.639 align:start position:0%
scholarship that for a field that
 
02:00:22.910 --> 02:00:22.920 align:start position:0%
basically no longer exists after 100
 
02:00:22.920 --> 02:00:25.669 align:start position:0%
basically no longer exists after 100
years

02:00:25.669 --> 02:00:25.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:27.589 --> 02:00:27.599 align:start position:0%
I wish we'd been raising money a hundred
 
02:00:28.870 --> 02:00:28.880 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
02:00:31.850 --> 02:00:31.860 align:start position:0%
our our efforts in development are
 
02:00:33.290 --> 02:00:33.300 align:start position:0%
actually quite a bit newer it's an area
 
02:00:34.729 --> 02:00:34.739 align:start position:0%
of catch-up for us that's one of the
 
02:00:36.470 --> 02:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
reasons why you heard me say earlier I'm
 
02:00:38.330 --> 02:00:38.340 align:start position:0%
investing in development officers is to
 
02:00:41.030 --> 02:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
try and play catch-up yeah we have that
 
02:00:43.010 --> 02:00:43.020 align:start position:0%
um if you have a situation like that you
 
02:00:44.089 --> 02:00:44.099 align:start position:0%
sound like you've been around this just
 
02:00:45.950 --> 02:00:45.960 align:start position:0%
because of the language you're using uh
 
02:00:48.109 --> 02:00:48.119 align:start position:0%
we'll go back to the representative of
 
02:00:49.910 --> 02:00:49.920 align:start position:0%
the donors sometimes it's children or
 
02:00:51.830 --> 02:00:51.840 align:start position:0%
grandchildren and try to see if we can
 
02:00:53.750 --> 02:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
renegotiate it there are also
 
02:00:56.270 --> 02:00:56.280 align:start position:0%
conventions about if there's no one that
 
02:00:57.890 --> 02:00:57.900 align:start position:0%
you can really contact what you could
 
02:00:59.810 --> 02:00:59.820 align:start position:0%
reasonably do to interpret the donor's
 
02:01:02.149 --> 02:01:02.159 align:start position:0%
intent and we do try to do that because
 
02:01:03.290 --> 02:01:03.300 align:start position:0%
the worst thing is to have this money
 
02:01:04.490 --> 02:01:04.500 align:start position:0%
sitting there and you can't spend it
 
02:01:05.750 --> 02:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
that's awful
 
02:01:07.729 --> 02:01:07.739 align:start position:0%
well a number of years ago we even went
 
02:01:09.290 --> 02:01:09.300 align:start position:0%
to Probate Court yeah
 
02:01:12.649 --> 02:01:12.659 align:start position:0%
that we for just that reason and there
 
02:01:14.390 --> 02:01:14.400 align:start position:0%
was no donor representative that we
 
02:01:15.770 --> 02:01:15.780 align:start position:0%
could reach out to the other thing that
 
02:01:17.089 --> 02:01:17.099 align:start position:0%
I would say was and I'm sure you know
 
02:01:21.709 --> 02:01:21.719 align:start position:0%
this as well we try to not have people
 
02:01:23.450 --> 02:01:23.460 align:start position:0%
give these really restrictive
 
02:01:26.270 --> 02:01:26.280 align:start position:0%
left-handed Brown I mean what people
 
02:01:27.410 --> 02:01:27.420 align:start position:0%
want to do it but you try to keep them
 
02:01:28.910 --> 02:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
doing it because it just you can't spend
 
02:01:31.910 --> 02:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
the money it's awful
 
02:01:31.920 --> 02:01:33.350 align:start position:0%
the money it's awful
okay

02:01:33.350 --> 02:01:33.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:01:35.870 --> 02:01:35.880 align:start position:0%

foreign

02:01:41.750 --> 02:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
02:01:41.760 --> 02:02:02.410 align:start position:0%
foreign
yes

02:02:02.410 --> 02:02:02.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:05.109 --> 02:02:05.119 align:start position:0%
it's amazing
 
02:02:13.149 --> 02:02:13.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:40.490 --> 03:03:40.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:44.630 --> 03:03:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:47.349 --> 03:03:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:55.610 --> 03:03:55.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:55.620 --> 03:03:57.969 align:start position:0%
 
uh

03:03:57.969 --> 03:03:57.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:18.410 --> 03:04:18.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:22.910 --> 03:04:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:24.469 --> 03:04:24.479 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um good afternoon Charlie
 
03:04:26.450 --> 03:04:26.460 align:start position:0%
McIntyre New Hampshire lottery uh with
 
03:04:28.730 --> 03:04:28.740 align:start position:0%
me as our Chief Financial Officer Jim
 
03:04:30.590 --> 03:04:30.600 align:start position:0%
durris and it's a simple one-page
 
03:04:30.600 --> 03:04:31.790 align:start position:0%
durris and it's a simple one-page
handout

03:04:31.790 --> 03:04:31.800 align:start position:0%
handout
 
03:04:34.250 --> 03:04:34.260 align:start position:0%
um I'm a big fan of a fan of simple and
 
03:04:37.670 --> 03:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
visual and that would be the handout you
 
03:04:39.469 --> 03:04:39.479 align:start position:0%
have which is both
 
03:04:42.410 --> 03:04:42.420 align:start position:0%
um obviously it's a graph as well as a
 
03:04:43.790 --> 03:04:43.800 align:start position:0%
box of numbers
 
03:04:45.950 --> 03:04:45.960 align:start position:0%
what it does is it reflects the revenue
 
03:04:47.389 --> 03:04:47.399 align:start position:0%
transfers to the state from New
 
03:04:50.570 --> 03:04:50.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire lottery as well as what that
 
03:04:52.309 --> 03:04:52.319 align:start position:0%
transfer costs to state in terms of
 
03:04:54.950 --> 03:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
operating expenses
 
03:04:58.790 --> 03:04:58.800 align:start position:0%
if you can triple net revenue and not
 
03:05:01.010 --> 03:05:01.020 align:start position:0%
increase expenses in the private sector
 
03:05:03.490 --> 03:05:03.500 align:start position:0%
that's called better than a good
 
03:05:05.510 --> 03:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
and so
 
03:05:05.520 --> 03:05:06.110 align:start position:0%
and so
um

03:05:06.110 --> 03:05:06.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:05:07.910 --> 03:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
I would submit to you that we've been
 
03:05:09.710 --> 03:05:09.720 align:start position:0%
remarkably efficient with people's money
 
03:05:12.110 --> 03:05:12.120 align:start position:0%
and it has been reflected both on our
 
03:05:14.150 --> 03:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
expenses as well as a return to
 
03:05:16.730 --> 03:05:16.740 align:start position:0%
education I would note that this year
 
03:05:20.330 --> 03:05:20.340 align:start position:0%
our transfer number was increased our
 
03:05:22.190 --> 03:05:22.200 align:start position:0%
current profit estimate for the year is
 
03:05:25.070 --> 03:05:25.080 align:start position:0%
now 170.8 million dollars which is an
 
03:05:26.630 --> 03:05:26.640 align:start position:0%
increase of
 
03:05:28.910 --> 03:05:28.920 align:start position:0%
30 million dollars to the general to the
 
03:05:31.070 --> 03:05:31.080 align:start position:0%
education trust fund which is money you
 
03:05:32.990 --> 03:05:33.000 align:start position:0%
folks get to spend uh that we take no
 
03:05:35.150 --> 03:05:35.160 align:start position:0%
position on how you spend it
 
03:05:36.790 --> 03:05:36.800 align:start position:0%
um that's a problem
 
03:05:39.010 --> 03:05:39.020 align:start position:0%
too much money
 
03:05:44.630 --> 03:05:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:46.670 --> 03:05:46.680 align:start position:0%
if you folks would stop sending us have
 
03:05:49.490 --> 03:05:49.500 align:start position:0%
to do I could yeah no I I appreciate it
 
03:05:50.929 --> 03:05:50.939 align:start position:0%
but certainly we try to do our best if
 
03:05:52.670 --> 03:05:52.680 align:start position:0%
you could imagine
 
03:05:54.230 --> 03:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
um on a number of occasions we've been
 
03:05:55.610 --> 03:05:55.620 align:start position:0%
recognized as one of the top lotteries
 
03:05:57.230 --> 03:05:57.240 align:start position:0%
in North America in terms of growth so
 
03:05:59.090 --> 03:05:59.100 align:start position:0%
we're proud of that despite the problem
 
03:06:01.370 --> 03:06:01.380 align:start position:0%
having too much money I would submit to
 
03:06:02.929 --> 03:06:02.939 align:start position:0%
you California wishes that same problem
 
03:06:02.939 --> 03:06:04.309 align:start position:0%
you California wishes that same problem
right

03:06:04.309 --> 03:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:06:05.809 --> 03:06:05.819 align:start position:0%
question do you have a question Tom
 
03:06:07.730 --> 03:06:07.740 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:06:10.250 --> 03:06:10.260 align:start position:0%
um is this the page you're talking about
 
03:06:12.650 --> 03:06:12.660 align:start position:0%
that shows yeah
 
03:06:15.170 --> 03:06:15.180 align:start position:0%
this is a hundred and no this does not
 
03:06:17.690 --> 03:06:17.700 align:start position:0%
quite readers those are the actual the
 
03:06:19.670 --> 03:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
the last so the current our current
 
03:06:21.830 --> 03:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
estimate is an estimate it's fiscal year
 
03:06:23.450 --> 03:06:23.460 align:start position:0%
23 which is not reflected in this
 
03:06:28.370 --> 03:06:28.380 align:start position:0%
Graphics okay yeah so 170 and 30.8 yes
 
03:06:31.370 --> 03:06:31.380 align:start position:0%
operating expenses are going to be 15
 
03:06:33.290 --> 03:06:33.300 align:start position:0%
million is that what this is
 
03:06:35.230 --> 03:06:35.240 align:start position:0%
in the governor's budget
 
03:06:40.309 --> 03:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
15 and 14 yeah 15 yes so FY 24. guess
 
03:06:43.070 --> 03:06:43.080 align:start position:0%
what I was looking at yes thank you so
 
03:06:44.870 --> 03:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
that would be there that would be the uh
 
03:06:47.469 --> 03:06:47.479 align:start position:0%
Governor's submitted budget um
 
03:06:47.479 --> 03:06:49.309 align:start position:0%
Governor's submitted budget um
15.2294

03:06:49.309 --> 03:06:49.319 align:start position:0%
15.2294
 
03:06:51.110 --> 03:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
is fy24
 
03:06:54.170 --> 03:06:54.180 align:start position:0%
and for that we get 170 million well
 
03:06:55.910 --> 03:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
that's this year actually this year for
 
03:06:57.710 --> 03:06:57.720 align:start position:0%
13 million dollars you get 170 million
 
03:06:59.929 --> 03:06:59.939 align:start position:0%
back and also realized one of the best
 
03:07:02.389 --> 03:07:02.399 align:start position:0%
parts about our money is it's just a
 
03:07:04.250 --> 03:07:04.260 align:start position:0%
permission to expend
 
03:07:07.130 --> 03:07:07.140 align:start position:0%
the budget you folks approve
 
03:07:09.830 --> 03:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
we spend from our Revenue stream we
 
03:07:11.150 --> 03:07:11.160 align:start position:0%
don't actually receive any funding from
 
03:07:13.490 --> 03:07:13.500 align:start position:0%
you folks okay it's just a deduction and
 
03:07:16.429 --> 03:07:16.439 align:start position:0%
that's pursuant to article 6B of the
 
03:07:18.349 --> 03:07:18.359 align:start position:0%
State Constitution which says revenues
 
03:07:19.730 --> 03:07:19.740 align:start position:0%
minus expenses equals are trying to
 
03:07:21.110 --> 03:07:21.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for explaining that thank you
 
03:07:23.389 --> 03:07:23.399 align:start position:0%
basically an Enterprise fund correct
 
03:07:25.610 --> 03:07:25.620 align:start position:0%
yeah we do Enterprise accounting our CFO
 
03:07:27.170 --> 03:07:27.180 align:start position:0%
does an annual report which is submitted
 
03:07:29.870 --> 03:07:29.880 align:start position:0%
to fiscal actually which just lasts a
 
03:07:32.929 --> 03:07:32.939 align:start position:0%
month yeah December yeah
 
03:07:32.939 --> 03:07:34.210 align:start position:0%
month yeah December yeah
um

03:07:34.210 --> 03:07:34.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:07:37.790 --> 03:07:37.800 align:start position:0%
General yeah and so
 
03:07:40.610 --> 03:07:40.620 align:start position:0%
um there'll be a to this point as to our
 
03:07:43.010 --> 03:07:43.020 align:start position:0%
budget there'll be a further request
 
03:07:45.170 --> 03:07:45.180 align:start position:0%
um that is not before you today but I
 
03:07:46.610 --> 03:07:46.620 align:start position:0%
certainly I want to speak to it it's
 
03:07:49.070 --> 03:07:49.080 align:start position:0%
there was a request
 
03:07:50.809 --> 03:07:50.819 align:start position:0%
um during the governor's budget phase
 
03:07:53.570 --> 03:07:53.580 align:start position:0%
for a 1.189 expenditure for a customer
 
03:07:55.490 --> 03:07:55.500 align:start position:0%
relation management piece of software
 
03:07:57.590 --> 03:07:57.600 align:start position:0%
called Salesforce which will be
 
03:07:59.510 --> 03:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
contained within oit's budget which
 
03:08:01.510 --> 03:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
would come out of our budget essentially
 
03:08:04.670 --> 03:08:04.680 align:start position:0%
and so I wanted to sort of brief you
 
03:08:06.889 --> 03:08:06.899 align:start position:0%
that on that as well as I'll follow up
 
03:08:08.330 --> 03:08:08.340 align:start position:0%
with a submission as to what that
 
03:08:11.210 --> 03:08:11.220 align:start position:0%
entails uh it's really
 
03:08:13.250 --> 03:08:13.260 align:start position:0%
currently we're doing customer relations
 
03:08:16.070 --> 03:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
on Post-it notes and emails and the like
 
03:08:19.910 --> 03:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
and really migrating to custom relation
 
03:08:23.090 --> 03:08:23.100 align:start position:0%
management software will improve our
 
03:08:24.349 --> 03:08:24.359 align:start position:0%
business but also improve our
 
03:08:26.630 --> 03:08:26.640 align:start position:0%
constituent Services which as you can
 
03:08:28.429 --> 03:08:28.439 align:start position:0%
imagine we we get a lot of phone calls
 
03:08:30.469 --> 03:08:30.479 align:start position:0%
for an agency we get a lot of phone
 
03:08:32.929 --> 03:08:32.939 align:start position:0%
calls particularly as we've expanded
 
03:08:35.990 --> 03:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
what it is we do as well as where we do
 
03:08:37.730 --> 03:08:37.740 align:start position:0%
it I mean sports betting alone has been
 
03:08:39.710 --> 03:08:39.720 align:start position:0%
an entirely New Vertical of
 
03:08:42.349 --> 03:08:42.359 align:start position:0%
30 000 customers a month and so it's
 
03:08:44.030 --> 03:08:44.040 align:start position:0%
been a challenge
 
03:08:46.670 --> 03:08:46.680 align:start position:0%
so that would be certainly
 
03:08:46.680 --> 03:08:47.750 align:start position:0%
so that would be certainly
um

03:08:47.750 --> 03:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:08:50.150 --> 03:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
a request made of you folks but it'll be
 
03:08:52.309 --> 03:08:52.319 align:start position:0%
contained within oit's budget which is
 
03:08:56.469 --> 03:08:56.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:59.510 --> 03:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
1.189 million
 
03:09:01.370 --> 03:09:01.380 align:start position:0%
we do a lot of there's a lot of work
 
03:09:05.110 --> 03:09:05.120 align:start position:0%
done on Salesforce yeah yeah
 
03:09:08.450 --> 03:09:08.460 align:start position:0%
okay okay yeah it's division one oit is
 
03:09:10.490 --> 03:09:10.500 align:start position:0%
on division one and then we there's
 
03:09:12.050 --> 03:09:12.060 align:start position:0%
there's just a pass-through obviously
 
03:09:14.870 --> 03:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
they bill us for what they do so
 
03:09:16.490 --> 03:09:16.500 align:start position:0%
yeah that's a one-time expense it's not
 
03:09:18.530 --> 03:09:18.540 align:start position:0%
a recurring expense it's just the to buy
 
03:09:19.550 --> 03:09:19.560 align:start position:0%
the software and pay for the
 
03:09:21.410 --> 03:09:21.420 align:start position:0%
implementation of the software
 
03:09:24.230 --> 03:09:24.240 align:start position:0%
question yeah thank you Mr chairman uh
 
03:09:25.730 --> 03:09:25.740 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here
 
03:09:28.429 --> 03:09:28.439 align:start position:0%
um when do you expect that to be online
 
03:09:30.710 --> 03:09:30.720 align:start position:0%
Salesforce it would be certainly after
 
03:09:32.510 --> 03:09:32.520 align:start position:0%
you folks approve it and I think six
 
03:09:33.889 --> 03:09:33.899 align:start position:0%
months thereafter
 
03:09:35.690 --> 03:09:35.700 align:start position:0%
is what the
 
03:09:38.030 --> 03:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
realistically probably 20 25 by the time
 
03:09:39.349 --> 03:09:39.359 align:start position:0%
it's implemented
 
03:09:41.450 --> 03:09:41.460 align:start position:0%
yeah so it would be approved I mean
 
03:09:43.370 --> 03:09:43.380 align:start position:0%
fiscally you're 25. yes yeah yeah that's
 
03:09:45.230 --> 03:09:45.240 align:start position:0%
cool right so you know and I have one
 
03:09:47.990 --> 03:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
complaint at Mega Millions jackpot was
 
03:09:49.429 --> 03:09:49.439 align:start position:0%
just over the Border should have been in
 
03:09:51.110 --> 03:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
03:09:53.570 --> 03:09:53.580 align:start position:0%
uh yes that person wishes it was too
 
03:09:55.130 --> 03:09:55.140 align:start position:0%
they cost them 50 million dollars to
 
03:09:56.290 --> 03:09:56.300 align:start position:0%
income tax
 
03:09:59.809 --> 03:09:59.819 align:start position:0%
yes Maine had just increased their state
 
03:10:02.090 --> 03:10:02.100 align:start position:0%
income tax by two percent so it went
 
03:10:03.469 --> 03:10:03.479 align:start position:0%
from 40 million to 50 million dollars
 
03:10:05.030 --> 03:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
they paid in state income taxes in Maine
 
03:10:08.210 --> 03:10:08.220 align:start position:0%
if they just driven to Rochester bought
 
03:10:10.250 --> 03:10:10.260 align:start position:0%
it and then declared residency in New
 
03:10:10.260 --> 03:10:11.170 align:start position:0%
it and then declared residency in New
Hampshire

03:10:11.170 --> 03:10:11.180 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
03:10:14.950 --> 03:10:14.960 align:start position:0%
it would have been quite the savings
 
03:10:17.630 --> 03:10:17.640 align:start position:0%
store it was it was bought in Lebanon
 
03:10:21.050 --> 03:10:21.060 align:start position:0%
Maine yeah I know yeah and so it's
 
03:10:22.790 --> 03:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
literally a mile to the Border in
 
03:10:24.650 --> 03:10:24.660 align:start position:0%
Rochester they would have been
 
03:10:26.030 --> 03:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
um ever so much richer not that they're
 
03:10:28.250 --> 03:10:28.260 align:start position:0%
not rich now but
 
03:10:30.889 --> 03:10:30.899 align:start position:0%
yeah main the revenue commissioner had a
 
03:10:30.899 --> 03:10:32.690 align:start position:0%
yeah main the revenue commissioner had a
windfall

03:10:32.690 --> 03:10:32.700 align:start position:0%
windfall
 
03:10:35.330 --> 03:10:35.340 align:start position:0%
and so certainly uh happy to answer your
 
03:10:37.070 --> 03:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
questions I know you folks have a busy
 
03:10:39.410 --> 03:10:39.420 align:start position:0%
schedule our budget seems to be and is
 
03:10:41.450 --> 03:10:41.460 align:start position:0%
generally pretty simple uh we don't have
 
03:10:42.650 --> 03:10:42.660 align:start position:0%
lots of fed we don't have any federal
 
03:10:45.349 --> 03:10:45.359 align:start position:0%
grants any matching any money we have to
 
03:10:46.910 --> 03:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
expend we just
 
03:10:50.090 --> 03:10:50.100 align:start position:0%
hope you folks approve our budget and we
 
03:10:52.309 --> 03:10:52.319 align:start position:0%
it's forms the basis of what the revenue
 
03:10:54.950 --> 03:10:54.960 align:start position:0%
is we expect to return to the state
 
03:10:56.090 --> 03:10:56.100 align:start position:0%
um and we try to be pretty efficient
 
03:10:58.429 --> 03:10:58.439 align:start position:0%
with it okay
 
03:10:59.870 --> 03:10:59.880 align:start position:0%
you have a couple questions if you can
 
03:11:02.630 --> 03:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
just explain some things to me on page
 
03:11:06.590 --> 03:11:06.600 align:start position:0%
1210 you've got the 2 million in debt
 
03:11:08.870 --> 03:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
service and that goes away
 
03:11:10.550 --> 03:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
um what was that from where does that go
 
03:11:14.630 --> 03:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
so as part of our long-term strategy we
 
03:11:17.210 --> 03:11:17.220 align:start position:0%
bought our building
 
03:11:19.610 --> 03:11:19.620 align:start position:0%
um several years ago and as part of a
 
03:11:22.070 --> 03:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
the state had extra funds actually we
 
03:11:23.150 --> 03:11:23.160 align:start position:0%
had extra funds we were going to
 
03:11:25.610 --> 03:11:25.620 align:start position:0%
transfer more and so as a result we
 
03:11:27.170 --> 03:11:27.180 align:start position:0%
prepaid for our building which we had
 
03:11:29.090 --> 03:11:29.100 align:start position:0%
Debt Service on and now we own the
 
03:11:30.469 --> 03:11:30.479 align:start position:0%
building outright and don't pay debt
 
03:11:32.030 --> 03:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
service or you know principled interest
 
03:11:33.710 --> 03:11:33.720 align:start position:0%
on it and so that's what that is that
 
03:11:36.530 --> 03:11:36.540 align:start position:0%
2.7 million dollars is us our financials
 
03:11:38.929 --> 03:11:38.939 align:start position:0%
would recognize a uh an asset of that
 
03:11:41.510 --> 03:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
value on it okay thank you
 
03:11:44.570 --> 03:11:44.580 align:start position:0%
um on can I keep going sure
 
03:11:47.990 --> 03:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
on 12 11. um you've had some new things
 
03:11:51.230 --> 03:11:51.240 align:start position:0%
come online with lottery so are these
 
03:11:51.240 --> 03:11:52.610 align:start position:0%
come online with lottery so are these
positions

03:11:52.610 --> 03:11:52.620 align:start position:0%
positions
 
03:11:54.530 --> 03:11:54.540 align:start position:0%
um you've got what seven new positions
 
03:11:56.750 --> 03:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
here are these for this new it is yes
 
03:11:59.690 --> 03:11:59.700 align:start position:0%
it's just it's the the vast majority of
 
03:12:03.469 --> 03:12:03.479 align:start position:0%
them are to manage the growth of
 
03:12:06.410 --> 03:12:06.420 align:start position:0%
Lottery operations within the state
 
03:12:08.030 --> 03:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
as you can imagine it's certainly the
 
03:12:10.250 --> 03:12:10.260 align:start position:0%
graph here shows we scaled up you need
 
03:12:11.690 --> 03:12:11.700 align:start position:0%
to support scaling up
 
03:12:14.210 --> 03:12:14.220 align:start position:0%
and can you address
 
03:12:15.590 --> 03:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
um can you say a few words for the
 
03:12:18.170 --> 03:12:18.180 align:start position:0%
council for responsible gambling
 
03:12:20.090 --> 03:12:20.100 align:start position:0%
um that's bottom of 2011 it looks like
 
03:12:21.290 --> 03:12:21.300 align:start position:0%
there's some travel it looks like you're
 
03:12:22.790 --> 03:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
sending people out for training for that
 
03:12:24.950 --> 03:12:24.960 align:start position:0%
can you just speak to responsible
 
03:12:27.110 --> 03:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
gambling that actually brings up a point
 
03:12:29.269 --> 03:12:29.279 align:start position:0%
that I was going to speak to you sticky
 
03:12:31.250 --> 03:12:31.260 align:start position:0%
notes uh bring up to you that actually
 
03:12:33.650 --> 03:12:33.660 align:start position:0%
is a misclassification of the class code
 
03:12:36.230 --> 03:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
that should be class code 102 which is
 
03:12:39.290 --> 03:12:39.300 align:start position:0%
program Contract Services
 
03:12:41.389 --> 03:12:41.399 align:start position:0%
um the council responsible gambling
 
03:12:43.429 --> 03:12:43.439 align:start position:0%
where just is Administrative arm of us
 
03:12:45.290 --> 03:12:45.300 align:start position:0%
so they they do make their own decisions
 
03:12:46.429 --> 03:12:46.439 align:start position:0%
and everything like that but they
 
03:12:49.010 --> 03:12:49.020 align:start position:0%
contract out the entire amount at least
 
03:12:51.349 --> 03:12:51.359 align:start position:0%
so far they contracted out to the
 
03:12:53.570 --> 03:12:53.580 align:start position:0%
Council of a responsible gambling
 
03:12:56.090 --> 03:12:56.100 align:start position:0%
yes I always get them mixed up or excuse
 
03:13:00.349 --> 03:13:00.359 align:start position:0%
me counsel for problems yeah
 
03:13:02.630 --> 03:13:02.640 align:start position:0%
um so that's that needs to be reclassed
 
03:13:04.250 --> 03:13:04.260 align:start position:0%
if we can make that change that would be
 
03:13:06.230 --> 03:13:06.240 align:start position:0%
great that was on our plan to talk to
 
03:13:07.250 --> 03:13:07.260 align:start position:0%
you about
 
03:13:10.490 --> 03:13:10.500 align:start position:0%
uh so it's not for travel no no they do
 
03:13:12.590 --> 03:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
some travel but it's all contracted and
 
03:13:14.450 --> 03:13:14.460 align:start position:0%
they invoice on a monthly basis so we
 
03:13:17.809 --> 03:13:17.819 align:start position:0%
need to make a change class one zero two
 
03:13:18.950 --> 03:13:18.960 align:start position:0%
it should be
 
03:13:21.830 --> 03:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
yeah and to be very clear we have no
 
03:13:23.570 --> 03:13:23.580 align:start position:0%
input on what happens with the council
 
03:13:24.950 --> 03:13:24.960 align:start position:0%
for problem gambling or the responsible
 
03:13:26.990 --> 03:13:27.000 align:start position:0%
gambling they're just initially tied to
 
03:13:28.670 --> 03:13:28.680 align:start position:0%
use our finance department they use
 
03:13:30.469 --> 03:13:30.479 align:start position:0%
functions in our building just to make
 
03:13:36.469 --> 03:13:36.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:38.990 --> 03:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
thank you okay Joe
 
03:13:40.550 --> 03:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:13:40.560 --> 03:13:41.690 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

03:13:41.690 --> 03:13:41.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:13:43.730 --> 03:13:43.740 align:start position:0%
how does that contract work for your
 
03:13:45.469 --> 03:13:45.479 align:start position:0%
online gambling you know your your
 
03:13:47.030 --> 03:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
machine whatever I don't know what you
 
03:13:49.070 --> 03:13:49.080 align:start position:0%
call machines or
 
03:13:51.469 --> 03:13:51.479 align:start position:0%
yeah and and because they're not very
 
03:13:51.479 --> 03:13:52.670 align:start position:0%
yeah and and because they're not very
responsive

03:13:52.670 --> 03:13:52.680 align:start position:0%
responsive
 
03:13:54.590 --> 03:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
so you mean the machines that are in the
 
03:13:57.170 --> 03:13:57.180 align:start position:0%
stores no no not the machines in the
 
03:13:58.849 --> 03:13:58.859 align:start position:0%
store is the one that you go online and
 
03:14:03.110 --> 03:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
okay you know the the gaming machines
 
03:14:05.210 --> 03:14:05.220 align:start position:0%
so the machines that are online so if
 
03:14:06.830 --> 03:14:06.840 align:start position:0%
you open your phone out and want to play
 
03:14:08.330 --> 03:14:08.340 align:start position:0%
Powerball through your phone that's
 
03:14:10.809 --> 03:14:10.819 align:start position:0%
through a subcontractor with a called
 
03:14:16.070 --> 03:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:16.080 --> 03:14:19.090 align:start position:0%
 
games

03:14:19.090 --> 03:14:19.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:30.769 --> 03:14:30.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:33.469 --> 03:14:33.479 align:start position:0%
um so that's through the same vendor
 
03:14:35.450 --> 03:14:35.460 align:start position:0%
does that they have a call center that's
 
03:14:38.150 --> 03:14:38.160 align:start position:0%
based in East Lansing Michigan
 
03:14:39.889 --> 03:14:39.899 align:start position:0%
um and they're supposed to be remarkably
 
03:14:42.050 --> 03:14:42.060 align:start position:0%
responsive we actually have service
 
03:14:43.610 --> 03:14:43.620 align:start position:0%
level agreements with them that they're
 
03:14:45.290 --> 03:14:45.300 align:start position:0%
required to return phone calls within so
 
03:14:46.910 --> 03:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
many minutes they're required return
 
03:14:48.769 --> 03:14:48.779 align:start position:0%
emails within so many minutes and the
 
03:14:51.469 --> 03:14:51.479 align:start position:0%
like uh and certainly we keep track of
 
03:14:53.570 --> 03:14:53.580 align:start position:0%
that on a daily weekly basis and so
 
03:14:55.190 --> 03:14:55.200 align:start position:0%
there's a problem with that
 
03:14:58.250 --> 03:14:58.260 align:start position:0%
um I'd want to know but also our sales
 
03:15:01.429 --> 03:15:01.439 align:start position:0%
is this Salesforce program gonna help no
 
03:15:02.990 --> 03:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
I was at a different part of the house
 
03:15:05.870 --> 03:15:05.880 align:start position:0%
so as you can imagine there's two two
 
03:15:07.309 --> 03:15:07.319 align:start position:0%
areas you would call
 
03:15:09.710 --> 03:15:09.720 align:start position:0%
you would call them the phone number on
 
03:15:13.550 --> 03:15:13.560 align:start position:0%
the the app is to them frequently our
 
03:15:15.950 --> 03:15:15.960 align:start position:0%
office gets phone calls and knows how to
 
03:15:18.349 --> 03:15:18.359 align:start position:0%
contact them as well as teach folks how
 
03:15:20.690 --> 03:15:20.700 align:start position:0%
to call them directly as well as if
 
03:15:22.490 --> 03:15:22.500 align:start position:0%
there's a problem of significance it
 
03:15:24.590 --> 03:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
escalates up and then somebody higher up
 
03:15:26.269 --> 03:15:26.279 align:start position:0%
call somebody higher up and makes it an
 
03:15:29.929 --> 03:15:29.939 align:start position:0%
issue that contract is up for bid we're
 
03:15:33.650 --> 03:15:33.660 align:start position:0%
releasing an RFP in a matter of weeks
 
03:15:35.990 --> 03:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
um and you know it'll get better with
 
03:15:37.849 --> 03:15:37.859 align:start position:0%
time but certainly that's how it's
 
03:15:39.110 --> 03:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
handled now and if there's a problem
 
03:15:40.370 --> 03:15:40.380 align:start position:0%
representative I want to know about it
 
03:15:42.230 --> 03:15:42.240 align:start position:0%
like if it's a real problem please call
 
03:15:43.969 --> 03:15:43.979 align:start position:0%
me yeah because the rest of the you know
 
03:15:46.070 --> 03:15:46.080 align:start position:0%
that's a contract and I realize that
 
03:15:48.349 --> 03:15:48.359 align:start position:0%
sometimes I don't always go as planned
 
03:15:50.570 --> 03:15:50.580 align:start position:0%
so yeah no of course and certainly I
 
03:15:51.590 --> 03:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
mean they're trained in a number of
 
03:15:51.600 --> 03:15:52.730 align:start position:0%
mean they're trained in a number of
functions

03:15:52.730 --> 03:15:52.740 align:start position:0%
functions
 
03:15:54.410 --> 03:15:54.420 align:start position:0%
um and there should be no problems
 
03:15:55.730 --> 03:15:55.740 align:start position:0%
particularly after we've been doing this
 
03:15:57.889 --> 03:15:57.899 align:start position:0%
now for one half years I mean not
 
03:15:59.450 --> 03:15:59.460 align:start position:0%
everyone's going to win that problem
 
03:16:03.910 --> 03:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:05.750 --> 03:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
but certainly there should be no
 
03:16:07.450 --> 03:16:07.460 align:start position:0%
problems in terms of a customer service
 
03:16:14.150 --> 03:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:16.010 --> 03:16:16.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
03:16:18.110 --> 03:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
taking the questions I'm looking at some
 
03:16:19.670 --> 03:16:19.680 align:start position:0%
of your lines and I'm looking at the
 
03:16:23.870 --> 03:16:23.880 align:start position:0%
numbers between 22 the FY 2023 adjusted
 
03:16:27.110 --> 03:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
and then a budgeted for 24.25 there are
 
03:16:29.330 --> 03:16:29.340 align:start position:0%
some spikes in 23 and I'm curious
 
03:16:31.309 --> 03:16:31.319 align:start position:0%
whether that's because the year is not
 
03:16:33.230 --> 03:16:33.240 align:start position:0%
over and we're looking at an estimate or
 
03:16:35.690 --> 03:16:35.700 align:start position:0%
there is a underlying reason starting
 
03:16:40.130 --> 03:16:40.140 align:start position:0%
with uh for example uh 64 line 64 the
 
03:16:41.750 --> 03:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
retirement pension benefits health
 
03:16:41.760 --> 03:16:42.889 align:start position:0%
retirement pension benefits health
insurance

03:16:42.889 --> 03:16:42.899 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
03:16:46.250 --> 03:16:46.260 align:start position:0%
you have you're going from 299 in 22 to
 
03:16:50.570 --> 03:16:50.580 align:start position:0%
470 and then down to 314 352. do you
 
03:16:52.610 --> 03:16:52.620 align:start position:0%
have any you know back color on why the
 
03:16:55.550 --> 03:16:55.560 align:start position:0%
470 excuse me the uh those all numbers
 
03:16:57.830 --> 03:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
all come from Das and Department of
 
03:17:01.070 --> 03:17:01.080 align:start position:0%
personnel I believe they they uh change
 
03:17:02.630 --> 03:17:02.640 align:start position:0%
carriers at some point over the last
 
03:17:04.309 --> 03:17:04.319 align:start position:0%
couple years which I know has affected
 
03:17:07.610 --> 03:17:07.620 align:start position:0%
that expense along with our
 
03:17:09.769 --> 03:17:09.779 align:start position:0%
um post employment benefits and things
 
03:17:11.090 --> 03:17:11.100 align:start position:0%
along those lines when we make
 
03:17:13.429 --> 03:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
adjustments at the end of the year
 
03:17:15.050 --> 03:17:15.060 align:start position:0%
um so that would be the explanation for
 
03:17:17.630 --> 03:17:17.640 align:start position:0%
something like that thank you and there
 
03:17:19.610 --> 03:17:19.620 align:start position:0%
is a similar question for number item
 
03:17:21.769 --> 03:17:21.779 align:start position:0%
number 20 current expenses where again
 
03:17:25.610 --> 03:17:25.620 align:start position:0%
you know it goes from 335 in 22 to 529
 
03:17:29.750 --> 03:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
and then it's budgeted to 445 479. again
 
03:17:31.490 --> 03:17:31.500 align:start position:0%
when I'm looking for color it's you know
 
03:17:33.830 --> 03:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious what caused it I'm
 
03:17:35.690 --> 03:17:35.700 align:start position:0%
assuming it's a one-time type situation
 
03:17:37.309 --> 03:17:37.319 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't show up in the budget
 
03:17:41.030 --> 03:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
but just so 20 uh line 20 is current
 
03:17:43.670 --> 03:17:43.680 align:start position:0%
expenses is a number of functions uh
 
03:17:46.190 --> 03:17:46.200 align:start position:0%
like for example the LBA that does our
 
03:17:48.530 --> 03:17:48.540 align:start position:0%
audit we pay for the audit out of that
 
03:17:50.330 --> 03:17:50.340 align:start position:0%
line item
 
03:17:53.210 --> 03:17:53.220 align:start position:0%
um the majority of those funds are used
 
03:17:55.849 --> 03:17:55.859 align:start position:0%
to support retailers in
 
03:17:58.370 --> 03:17:58.380 align:start position:0%
retail networks so for example if we're
 
03:18:00.610 --> 03:18:00.620 align:start position:0%
buying bet stations which are those
 
03:18:04.070 --> 03:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
blocks or terminals that you would use
 
03:18:05.990 --> 03:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
to write a ticket on that comes from
 
03:18:07.370 --> 03:18:07.380 align:start position:0%
there as well as
 
03:18:10.070 --> 03:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
if we buy plastic dispensers if a store
 
03:18:11.570 --> 03:18:11.580 align:start position:0%
has dispensers which have tickets in
 
03:18:13.429 --> 03:18:13.439 align:start position:0%
them we pay for those and we replace
 
03:18:15.469 --> 03:18:15.479 align:start position:0%
them with those yeah and so usually it's
 
03:18:17.750 --> 03:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
meant to sort of replace what are
 
03:18:19.969 --> 03:18:19.979 align:start position:0%
essentially durable goods in retail and
 
03:18:22.550 --> 03:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
support them and so that Ebbs inflows as
 
03:18:24.650 --> 03:18:24.660 align:start position:0%
the need Ebbs and flows fully understood
 
03:18:27.230 --> 03:18:27.240 align:start position:0%
and my last quick question on uh 69
 
03:18:30.230 --> 03:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
promotion and marketing you seem to plan
 
03:18:32.630 --> 03:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
to hike your marketing budget by quite a
 
03:18:35.389 --> 03:18:35.399 align:start position:0%
bit yes just curious you know again in
 
03:18:36.710 --> 03:18:36.720 align:start position:0%
terms of
 
03:18:39.410 --> 03:18:39.420 align:start position:0%
why and what do you expect the outcome
 
03:18:41.330 --> 03:18:41.340 align:start position:0%
of that to be well certainly it's meant
 
03:18:42.530 --> 03:18:42.540 align:start position:0%
to support the growth in Revenue
 
03:18:44.450 --> 03:18:44.460 align:start position:0%
obviously uh yeah yeah I mean you know
 
03:18:46.070 --> 03:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
it's sort of fundamentally as you can
 
03:18:47.510 --> 03:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
imagine we run this like a business not
 
03:18:49.070 --> 03:18:49.080 align:start position:0%
a state agency
 
03:18:51.410 --> 03:18:51.420 align:start position:0%
um and there's two reasons one is the
 
03:18:53.510 --> 03:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
cost of marketing has gone up
 
03:18:55.309 --> 03:18:55.319 align:start position:0%
by double digits
 
03:18:57.170 --> 03:18:57.180 align:start position:0%
um the cost of air time as well as the
 
03:18:59.269 --> 03:18:59.279 align:start position:0%
cost of production costs has gone and
 
03:19:02.030 --> 03:19:02.040 align:start position:0%
put the cost of inflation uh I think I
 
03:19:03.650 --> 03:19:03.660 align:start position:0%
get an estimate probably a month ago
 
03:19:05.809 --> 03:19:05.819 align:start position:0%
that it was 16 increase in production
 
03:19:07.969 --> 03:19:07.979 align:start position:0%
costs so just to produce an ad which
 
03:19:10.010 --> 03:19:10.020 align:start position:0%
costs 100 000 now costs a hundred and
 
03:19:11.630 --> 03:19:11.640 align:start position:0%
sixteen thousand
 
03:19:15.830 --> 03:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
um also we are cognizant of the fact
 
03:19:17.389 --> 03:19:17.399 align:start position:0%
that mass has now approved sports
 
03:19:19.969 --> 03:19:19.979 align:start position:0%
betting for which we derive this year
 
03:19:21.349 --> 03:19:21.359 align:start position:0%
probably 30 million dollars in
 
03:19:23.750 --> 03:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
profitability which is three times more
 
03:19:26.150 --> 03:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
than we anticipated and you know we like
 
03:19:26.160 --> 03:19:27.250 align:start position:0%
than we anticipated and you know we like
that

03:19:27.250 --> 03:19:27.260 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:19:29.510 --> 03:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
and so we're trying to maintain that
 
03:19:31.370 --> 03:19:31.380 align:start position:0%
level of competition as well as revenue
 
03:19:34.309 --> 03:19:34.319 align:start position:0%
and so that's the reason behind it one
 
03:19:35.570 --> 03:19:35.580 align:start position:0%
of the things you'll notice is when it
 
03:19:38.269 --> 03:19:38.279 align:start position:0%
comes to 22 versus 23 if we didn't need
 
03:19:41.150 --> 03:19:41.160 align:start position:0%
it we don't spend it yeah no maybe no
 
03:19:42.590 --> 03:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
concern about that yeah no it would be
 
03:19:44.630 --> 03:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
for us you know my colleague to my right
 
03:19:47.030 --> 03:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
here is fanatical uh he treats your
 
03:19:49.490 --> 03:19:49.500 align:start position:0%
money like you wish everyone did uh in
 
03:19:52.250 --> 03:19:52.260 align:start position:0%
terms of spending it and defending it so
 
03:19:54.530 --> 03:19:54.540 align:start position:0%
um it's just so that if we need to sort
 
03:19:58.309 --> 03:19:58.319 align:start position:0%
of run an advertising campaign or
 
03:19:59.929 --> 03:19:59.939 align:start position:0%
approach Massachusetts and try and get
 
03:20:01.670 --> 03:20:01.680 align:start position:0%
back some customers we have the funds to
 
03:20:05.630 --> 03:20:05.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:07.490 --> 03:20:07.500 align:start position:0%
just said what I said thank you I mean
 
03:20:10.130 --> 03:20:10.140 align:start position:0%
you've come to us session after session
 
03:20:12.710 --> 03:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
and you come to us you don't ask us
 
03:20:14.389 --> 03:20:14.399 align:start position:0%
really for anything because you do all
 
03:20:15.889 --> 03:20:15.899 align:start position:0%
your own stuff
 
03:20:17.389 --> 03:20:17.399 align:start position:0%
um I'm a little bit concerned about what
 
03:20:20.330 --> 03:20:20.340 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts is doing as well do you
 
03:20:23.929 --> 03:20:23.939 align:start position:0%
anticipate a large percentage of loss in
 
03:20:26.389 --> 03:20:26.399 align:start position:0%
terms or you're making an effort to do
 
03:20:29.330 --> 03:20:29.340 align:start position:0%
more advertising to compete what do you
 
03:20:31.250 --> 03:20:31.260 align:start position:0%
think is going to happen
 
03:20:33.349 --> 03:20:33.359 align:start position:0%
um it's the billion dollar question I
 
03:20:35.330 --> 03:20:35.340 align:start position:0%
know I get that a lot but
 
03:20:35.340 --> 03:20:36.410 align:start position:0%
know I get that a lot but
um

03:20:36.410 --> 03:20:36.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:20:38.809 --> 03:20:38.819 align:start position:0%
I draw Solas in what happened with New
 
03:20:40.550 --> 03:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
York and New Jersey New Jersey was live
 
03:20:42.050 --> 03:20:42.060 align:start position:0%
for a number of years before New York
 
03:20:44.450 --> 03:20:44.460 align:start position:0%
was and there was a suggestion that New
 
03:20:46.010 --> 03:20:46.020 align:start position:0%
Jersey would fall off a cliff and it
 
03:20:47.750 --> 03:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
didn't happen
 
03:20:49.730 --> 03:20:49.740 align:start position:0%
so we we look at sports betting in two
 
03:20:52.429 --> 03:20:52.439 align:start position:0%
different ways retail and mobile
 
03:20:54.530 --> 03:20:54.540 align:start position:0%
so retail of the facilities in Hampton
 
03:20:54.540 --> 03:20:56.150 align:start position:0%
so retail of the facilities in Hampton
and

03:20:56.150 --> 03:20:56.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:20:58.070 --> 03:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
um Dover and Manchester and soon to be
 
03:21:00.230 --> 03:21:00.240 align:start position:0%
other states other parts of the state
 
03:21:02.809 --> 03:21:02.819 align:start position:0%
I expect almost no loss there
 
03:21:05.389 --> 03:21:05.399 align:start position:0%
when it comes to mobile
 
03:21:05.399 --> 03:21:06.590 align:start position:0%
when it comes to mobile
um

03:21:06.590 --> 03:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:21:08.450 --> 03:21:08.460 align:start position:0%
it's a good question
 
03:21:10.610 --> 03:21:10.620 align:start position:0%
um I would expect double digits but not
 
03:21:13.250 --> 03:21:13.260 align:start position:0%
much and certainly so some impact which
 
03:21:14.750 --> 03:21:14.760 align:start position:0%
is reflected in our Revenue estimates
 
03:21:17.450 --> 03:21:17.460 align:start position:0%
for the out years but not critical
 
03:21:19.429 --> 03:21:19.439 align:start position:0%
absolutely not you know to the point of
 
03:21:21.050 --> 03:21:21.060 align:start position:0%
being Terror
 
03:21:24.469 --> 03:21:24.479 align:start position:0%
and my next question is what tricks do
 
03:21:25.870 --> 03:21:25.880 align:start position:0%
you have up your sleeve
 
03:21:30.769 --> 03:21:30.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:32.990 --> 03:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
um one of the things we've pride
 
03:21:34.969 --> 03:21:34.979 align:start position:0%
ourselves in greatly is we're number two
 
03:21:36.170 --> 03:21:36.180 align:start position:0%
in the country per capita for sports
 
03:21:38.750 --> 03:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
Revenue so it's New York one New
 
03:21:40.550 --> 03:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's number two and then there's
 
03:21:42.710 --> 03:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
a bunch of States way off the cliff
 
03:21:44.090 --> 03:21:44.100 align:start position:0%
um in terms of money that goes to the
 
03:21:46.490 --> 03:21:46.500 align:start position:0%
state to pay for State Services
 
03:21:48.769 --> 03:21:48.779 align:start position:0%
um as you notice we didn't ask for
 
03:21:48.779 --> 03:21:50.210 align:start position:0%
um as you notice we didn't ask for
anything

03:21:50.210 --> 03:21:50.220 align:start position:0%
anything
 
03:21:51.889 --> 03:21:51.899 align:start position:0%
nor did we submit anything I don't think
 
03:21:53.570 --> 03:21:53.580 align:start position:0%
any there's many submissions I know that
 
03:21:55.910 --> 03:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
Senator Lang has a bill for online
 
03:21:58.250 --> 03:21:58.260 align:start position:0%
gaming which may make its way over to
 
03:22:00.889 --> 03:22:00.899 align:start position:0%
you folks at some point uh that would be
 
03:22:02.990 --> 03:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
the next iteration of gambling that
 
03:22:07.550 --> 03:22:07.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:10.130 --> 03:22:10.140 align:start position:0%
all right thank you uh charitable gaming
 
03:22:12.230 --> 03:22:12.240 align:start position:0%
seems so we've expanded and what what's
 
03:22:14.990 --> 03:22:15.000 align:start position:0%
your role in uh in that so in childhood
 
03:22:15.000 --> 03:22:15.950 align:start position:0%
your role in uh in that so in childhood
gambling

03:22:15.950 --> 03:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
gambling
 
03:22:19.030 --> 03:22:19.040 align:start position:0%
um that area is under the division of
 
03:22:21.290 --> 03:22:21.300 align:start position:0%
Investigation compliance and enforcement
 
03:22:22.610 --> 03:22:22.620 align:start position:0%
which is run by our chief compliance
 
03:22:25.370 --> 03:22:25.380 align:start position:0%
officer in that regard we're very much a
 
03:22:28.070 --> 03:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
referee and a regulator we're not an
 
03:22:31.190 --> 03:22:31.200 align:start position:0%
operator and so we maintain
 
03:22:33.170 --> 03:22:33.180 align:start position:0%
um licensing Authority as well as
 
03:22:34.670 --> 03:22:34.680 align:start position:0%
regulatory authority over virtually
 
03:22:36.290 --> 03:22:36.300 align:start position:0%
everything they do within the facility
 
03:22:38.750 --> 03:22:38.760 align:start position:0%
so our Authority begins and ends at the
 
03:22:40.730 --> 03:22:40.740 align:start position:0%
threshold and so
 
03:22:43.610 --> 03:22:43.620 align:start position:0%
so no no so uh it's been an issue with
 
03:22:45.410 --> 03:22:45.420 align:start position:0%
towns like Conway was an issue I was up
 
03:22:47.510 --> 03:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
there last week uh Lebanon has raised
 
03:22:48.769 --> 03:22:48.779 align:start position:0%
the issue
 
03:22:51.050 --> 03:22:51.060 align:start position:0%
um there is revenue from it so it
 
03:22:53.389 --> 03:22:53.399 align:start position:0%
depends on what areas charitable
 
03:22:55.250 --> 03:22:55.260 align:start position:0%
gambling we're talking about under what
 
03:22:57.349 --> 03:22:57.359 align:start position:0%
are called games of chance we derive a
 
03:22:58.450 --> 03:22:58.460 align:start position:0%
certain percentage of the revenue
 
03:23:01.190 --> 03:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
charity desire derives a certain
 
03:23:03.230 --> 03:23:03.240 align:start position:0%
percentage and the operator does
 
03:23:05.030 --> 03:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
under historic horse racing which has
 
03:23:07.429 --> 03:23:07.439 align:start position:0%
been an issue recently
 
03:23:09.769 --> 03:23:09.779 align:start position:0%
um the operator retains 75 of the
 
03:23:09.779 --> 03:23:10.670 align:start position:0%
um the operator retains 75 of the
revenue

03:23:10.670 --> 03:23:10.680 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
03:23:12.790 --> 03:23:12.800 align:start position:0%
of the remaining 25
 
03:23:15.830 --> 03:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
a third goes to the charity two-thirds
 
03:23:17.750 --> 03:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
goes to the state so you're talking
 
03:23:19.790 --> 03:23:19.800 align:start position:0%
approximately profitability to the state
 
03:23:22.010 --> 03:23:22.020 align:start position:0%
and charitable gambling total an
 
03:23:24.889 --> 03:23:24.899 align:start position:0%
estimate around say next year 16 or 17
 
03:23:24.899 --> 03:23:26.510 align:start position:0%
estimate around say next year 16 or 17
million

03:23:26.510 --> 03:23:26.520 align:start position:0%
million
 
03:23:28.010 --> 03:23:28.020 align:start position:0%
between historic horse racing and as
 
03:23:30.050 --> 03:23:30.060 align:start position:0%
well as games including historical yeah
 
03:23:34.130 --> 03:23:34.140 align:start position:0%
I forgot about a story yeah that's okay
 
03:23:37.250 --> 03:23:37.260 align:start position:0%
um so you expect that to grow I do I do
 
03:23:38.990 --> 03:23:39.000 align:start position:0%
but you know as you can imagine we tend
 
03:23:40.190 --> 03:23:40.200 align:start position:0%
to be conservative with our numbers
 
03:23:42.290 --> 03:23:42.300 align:start position:0%
because one of the difficulties in our
 
03:23:44.210 --> 03:23:44.220 align:start position:0%
job is if we give you a number you spend
 
03:23:46.550 --> 03:23:46.560 align:start position:0%
it and then we have to go make it and so
 
03:23:48.469 --> 03:23:48.479 align:start position:0%
a year from now you come back and say
 
03:23:50.150 --> 03:23:50.160 align:start position:0%
why didn't you hit our number then it's
 
03:23:51.950 --> 03:23:51.960 align:start position:0%
that's one of our one of our challenges
 
03:23:53.870 --> 03:23:53.880 align:start position:0%
is I I don't know when a Warren
 
03:23:55.130 --> 03:23:55.140 align:start position:0%
Ukrainian is going to raise gas prices
 
03:23:57.170 --> 03:23:57.180 align:start position:0%
and lottery sales well for clear for the
 
03:23:59.330 --> 03:23:59.340 align:start position:0%
equivalent it's it's difficult so we
 
03:24:01.790 --> 03:24:01.800 align:start position:0%
tend to be on the moderately
 
03:24:05.030 --> 03:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
conservative side of our estimates
 
03:24:08.090 --> 03:24:08.100 align:start position:0%
stay on the charitable gambling for a
 
03:24:09.889 --> 03:24:09.899 align:start position:0%
second yeah
 
03:24:11.690 --> 03:24:11.700 align:start position:0%
our church is debating whether to
 
03:24:11.700 --> 03:24:13.010 align:start position:0%
our church is debating whether to
participate

03:24:13.010 --> 03:24:13.020 align:start position:0%
participate
 
03:24:15.050 --> 03:24:15.060 align:start position:0%
and there's somebody got up and said
 
03:24:17.210 --> 03:24:17.220 align:start position:0%
well they're changing the numbers
 
03:24:20.030 --> 03:24:20.040 align:start position:0%
it used to be 35 to the charity and now
 
03:24:22.610 --> 03:24:22.620 align:start position:0%
they're dropping it to 10 so I think
 
03:24:24.530 --> 03:24:24.540 align:start position:0%
what they're talking about is that
 
03:24:27.469 --> 03:24:27.479 align:start position:0%
historic racing correct okay so that did
 
03:24:29.809 --> 03:24:29.819 align:start position:0%
change but yeah it's just what it's
 
03:24:31.729 --> 03:24:31.739 align:start position:0%
being done in the in the facility has a
 
03:24:34.130 --> 03:24:34.140 align:start position:0%
different take essentially okay that's
 
03:24:36.830 --> 03:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
all thank you
 
03:24:39.050 --> 03:24:39.060 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you could we get a chart
 
03:24:41.150 --> 03:24:41.160 align:start position:0%
about where all these things fit in
 
03:24:42.830 --> 03:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
absolutely you know just to get a little
 
03:24:44.389 --> 03:24:44.399 align:start position:0%
picture of it because the charitable
 
03:24:46.309 --> 03:24:46.319 align:start position:0%
sense has gone into it has gone a little
 
03:24:48.469 --> 03:24:48.479 align:start position:0%
bit you know just it's just one more
 
03:24:50.570 --> 03:24:50.580 align:start position:0%
Avenue to consider so a little picture
 
03:24:52.910 --> 03:24:52.920 align:start position:0%
would help and then did you consider
 
03:24:54.870 --> 03:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
selling mentholated tickets
 
03:24:54.880 --> 03:24:58.010 align:start position:0%
selling mentholated tickets
[Laughter]

03:24:58.010 --> 03:24:58.020 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
03:24:59.809 --> 03:24:59.819 align:start position:0%
so we actually sold
 
03:25:02.150 --> 03:25:02.160 align:start position:0%
um our head of products and sales This
 
03:25:04.130 --> 03:25:04.140 align:start position:0%
brilliant woman and she came up with the
 
03:25:06.910 --> 03:25:06.920 align:start position:0%
idea to sell bacon Center tickets
 
03:25:10.130 --> 03:25:10.140 align:start position:0%
which no I was not we actually saw it
 
03:25:12.110 --> 03:25:12.120 align:start position:0%
was scratching sniff bacon sent a ticket
 
03:25:14.690 --> 03:25:14.700 align:start position:0%
it was called I love bacon and it was on
 
03:25:16.910 --> 03:25:16.920 align:start position:0%
Good Morning America it was on CBS News
 
03:25:18.710 --> 03:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
it was on it was on the it was national
 
03:25:21.469 --> 03:25:21.479 align:start position:0%
news it was um yeah it's and I we went
 
03:25:23.210 --> 03:25:23.220 align:start position:0%
through seven eight iterations of the
 
03:25:25.429 --> 03:25:25.439 align:start position:0%
bacon smell all of which I tested my
 
03:25:30.190 --> 03:25:30.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:31.969 --> 03:25:31.979 align:start position:0%
I actually
 
03:25:33.530 --> 03:25:33.540 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if you find this funny I
 
03:25:34.910 --> 03:25:34.920 align:start position:0%
don't know if it's appropriate but I was
 
03:25:38.210 --> 03:25:38.220 align:start position:0%
I was almost sued by PETA because it was
 
03:25:39.950 --> 03:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
a big because I'd use bacon in a ticket
 
03:25:41.750 --> 03:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
and I said it's just chemicals it's just
 
03:25:43.490 --> 03:25:43.500 align:start position:0%
it's literally just a reaction of two
 
03:25:46.250 --> 03:25:46.260 align:start position:0%
but uh so I literally paid a Peter's
 
03:25:48.830 --> 03:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
takedown page for several days was us
 
03:25:51.910 --> 03:25:51.920 align:start position:0%
and me about how we were offending pigs
 
03:25:56.170 --> 03:25:56.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:02.870 --> 03:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:05.809 --> 03:26:05.819 align:start position:0%
thank you so I'm sorry I have to ask
 
03:26:08.269 --> 03:26:08.279 align:start position:0%
this but when we were trying to get
 
03:26:13.190 --> 03:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
gambling we couldn't get it failed
 
03:26:15.469 --> 03:26:15.479 align:start position:0%
but now now the charitable gaming
 
03:26:17.389 --> 03:26:17.399 align:start position:0%
casinos are coming up with where are
 
03:26:18.830 --> 03:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
they coming up with these licenses how
 
03:26:21.469 --> 03:26:21.479 align:start position:0%
did they how did they do that so as part
 
03:26:23.030 --> 03:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
of the authorization of historic horse
 
03:26:25.969 --> 03:26:25.979 align:start position:0%
racing there was a provision which
 
03:26:28.309 --> 03:26:28.319 align:start position:0%
allowed facilities which which had had
 
03:26:30.469 --> 03:26:30.479 align:start position:0%
games of chance charitable gaming
 
03:26:33.229 --> 03:26:33.239 align:start position:0%
license as of a certain date to be
 
03:26:35.630 --> 03:26:35.640 align:start position:0%
authorized to engage in charitable
 
03:26:37.309 --> 03:26:37.319 align:start position:0%
gambling specifically store course
 
03:26:37.319 --> 03:26:38.990 align:start position:0%
gambling specifically store course
racing

03:26:38.990 --> 03:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
racing
 
03:26:41.809 --> 03:26:41.819 align:start position:0%
as of at that date and they were the
 
03:26:44.510 --> 03:26:44.520 align:start position:0%
only ones that are eligible until July
 
03:26:48.550 --> 03:26:48.560 align:start position:0%
of 24. July 1 2024. it's in the HHR
 
03:26:50.990 --> 03:26:51.000 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation I get you a copy it
 
03:26:52.849 --> 03:26:52.859 align:start position:0%
if you want in terms of the language
 
03:26:54.050 --> 03:26:54.060 align:start position:0%
um thank you that would be helpful yeah
 
03:26:56.090 --> 03:26:56.100 align:start position:0%
and certainly there are
 
03:26:59.389 --> 03:26:59.399 align:start position:0%
there were 12 communities around the
 
03:27:01.130 --> 03:27:01.140 align:start position:0%
state all of which had had facilities
 
03:27:03.190 --> 03:27:03.200 align:start position:0%
that were authorized
 
03:27:05.330 --> 03:27:05.340 align:start position:0%
some hadn't been built yet but they've
 
03:27:06.530 --> 03:27:06.540 align:start position:0%
been authorized they'd received the
 
03:27:08.929 --> 03:27:08.939 align:start position:0%
approvals and they scattered the states
 
03:27:11.389 --> 03:27:11.399 align:start position:0%
it's from Berlin to Hampton over to
 
03:27:15.229 --> 03:27:15.239 align:start position:0%
Keene and and Nashua so it's kind of a
 
03:27:17.809 --> 03:27:17.819 align:start position:0%
surprise for the local people all of a
 
03:27:20.150 --> 03:27:20.160 align:start position:0%
sudden a casino shows up yeah I mean
 
03:27:22.250 --> 03:27:22.260 align:start position:0%
certainly it's called a casino it's
 
03:27:23.750 --> 03:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
called a casino for the obvious reasons
 
03:27:25.610 --> 03:27:25.620 align:start position:0%
it's good marketing
 
03:27:27.889 --> 03:27:27.899 align:start position:0%
um I often decide Casino was a term of
 
03:27:29.990 --> 03:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
art it's like saying what's a bistro I
 
03:27:31.370 --> 03:27:31.380 align:start position:0%
don't know they serve food they have
 
03:27:34.849 --> 03:27:34.859 align:start position:0%
drinks nice tables and so for me it's
 
03:27:36.469 --> 03:27:36.479 align:start position:0%
just what gambling is authorized by the
 
03:27:37.729 --> 03:27:37.739 align:start position:0%
state and we regulate whatever
 
03:27:39.590 --> 03:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
gambling's authorized by you folks we
 
03:27:41.030 --> 03:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
didn't we didn't we don't we don't get
 
03:27:42.469 --> 03:27:42.479 align:start position:0%
into Marketing in terms of truth of
 
03:27:43.729 --> 03:27:43.739 align:start position:0%
advertising what they call themselves
 
03:27:45.469 --> 03:27:45.479 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah
 
03:27:47.330 --> 03:27:47.340 align:start position:0%
I appreciate if you could send me that
 
03:27:50.690 --> 03:27:50.700 align:start position:0%
of course yeah let me um
 
03:27:52.490 --> 03:27:52.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman just a quick
 
03:27:54.530 --> 03:27:54.540 align:start position:0%
follow-up to this
 
03:27:56.150 --> 03:27:56.160 align:start position:0%
um I think I understand that you were
 
03:27:58.370 --> 03:27:58.380 align:start position:0%
saying that the authorization right now
 
03:28:00.469 --> 03:28:00.479 align:start position:0%
is for the 12 existing or authorized
 
03:28:02.450 --> 03:28:02.460 align:start position:0%
historic horse racing facilities at the
 
03:28:03.950 --> 03:28:03.960 align:start position:0%
time of the legislation was passed
 
03:28:07.010 --> 03:28:07.020 align:start position:0%
button you mentioned July 2024 what
 
03:28:08.809 --> 03:28:08.819 align:start position:0%
happened is then okay so it's actually
 
03:28:10.910 --> 03:28:10.920 align:start position:0%
12 towns in some of the towns there are
 
03:28:12.710 --> 03:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
multiple locations so that's what two I
 
03:28:13.429 --> 03:28:13.439 align:start position:0%
want to make sure I get that clear
 
03:28:15.290 --> 03:28:15.300 align:start position:0%
remember that's all
 
03:28:18.290 --> 03:28:18.300 align:start position:0%
um so the law proposed and you folks
 
03:28:20.570 --> 03:28:20.580 align:start position:0%
approved a moratorium of new facilities
 
03:28:24.170 --> 03:28:24.180 align:start position:0%
until July 1 of 2024. there are several
 
03:28:26.210 --> 03:28:26.220 align:start position:0%
bills flying around which would extend
 
03:28:28.550 --> 03:28:28.560 align:start position:0%
that or make that permanent
 
03:28:30.769 --> 03:28:30.779 align:start position:0%
um those for you to decide
 
03:28:32.990 --> 03:28:33.000 align:start position:0%
um after that date new facilities can be
 
03:28:33.000 --> 03:28:34.010 align:start position:0%
um after that date new facilities can be
opened

03:28:34.010 --> 03:28:34.020 align:start position:0%
opened
 
03:28:34.020 --> 03:28:35.929 align:start position:0%
opened
the

03:28:35.929 --> 03:28:35.939 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:28:38.570 --> 03:28:38.580 align:start position:0%
thing is is that we approved rules
 
03:28:41.690 --> 03:28:41.700 align:start position:0%
through jail car which restrict the type
 
03:28:43.610 --> 03:28:43.620 align:start position:0%
of facilities that can be launched and
 
03:28:45.530 --> 03:28:45.540 align:start position:0%
by that you mean
 
03:28:47.750 --> 03:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
in order to be historic horse racing
 
03:28:49.250 --> 03:28:49.260 align:start position:0%
Revenue you have to have so much of your
 
03:28:51.590 --> 03:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
floor being table spaced and so much of
 
03:28:53.570 --> 03:28:53.580 align:start position:0%
the floor so much of your Revenue be
 
03:28:55.849 --> 03:28:55.859 align:start position:0%
derived from table games and that was a
 
03:28:57.469 --> 03:28:57.479 align:start position:0%
couple of reasons one is to protect the
 
03:29:01.309 --> 03:29:01.319 align:start position:0%
Charities because as of July 24
 
03:29:05.090 --> 03:29:05.100 align:start position:0%
if an operator has to get up 45 of his
 
03:29:07.670 --> 03:29:07.680 align:start position:0%
profit to the state and Charities for
 
03:29:10.309 --> 03:29:10.319 align:start position:0%
tables and only 25 percent of its
 
03:29:12.710 --> 03:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
revenue from machines if I'm a
 
03:29:14.690 --> 03:29:14.700 align:start position:0%
businessman tables go away because
 
03:29:16.010 --> 03:29:16.020 align:start position:0%
they're far more expensive to run
 
03:29:18.110 --> 03:29:18.120 align:start position:0%
because you have to have people it's
 
03:29:20.330 --> 03:29:20.340 align:start position:0%
expensive machines just electricity
 
03:29:22.130 --> 03:29:22.140 align:start position:0%
which admittedly is more expensive it
 
03:29:23.750 --> 03:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
used to be but you know it's still less
 
03:29:25.910 --> 03:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
less expensive and so I wanted to make
 
03:29:27.950 --> 03:29:27.960 align:start position:0%
sure that the Charities that get derive
 
03:29:30.290 --> 03:29:30.300 align:start position:0%
all this money would get
 
03:29:33.349 --> 03:29:33.359 align:start position:0%
their share and then some and so there's
 
03:29:35.750 --> 03:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
a natural limit to what the expansion
 
03:29:39.710 --> 03:29:39.720 align:start position:0%
can be but certainly as of July 24 there
 
03:29:41.809 --> 03:29:41.819 align:start position:0%
can be new facilities under the existing
 
03:29:44.990 --> 03:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
law okay so if obviously if the statutes
 
03:29:46.490 --> 03:29:46.500 align:start position:0%
remain unchanged because whatever
 
03:29:48.590 --> 03:29:48.600 align:start position:0%
changes changes but assuming no
 
03:29:50.750 --> 03:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
legislative changes
 
03:29:54.830 --> 03:29:54.840 align:start position:0%
in July 2024 we may see a growth in this
 
03:29:56.630 --> 03:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
area because this current restrict
 
03:29:59.150 --> 03:29:59.160 align:start position:0%
restricting statue has a Sunset date of
 
03:30:01.309 --> 03:30:01.319 align:start position:0%
correct though I would suggest you as
 
03:30:02.630 --> 03:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
somebody who does gambling for a living
 
03:30:05.330 --> 03:30:05.340 align:start position:0%
candidly the market has a limit it's
 
03:30:07.490 --> 03:30:07.500 align:start position:0%
just a quick any foreign market
 
03:30:09.349 --> 03:30:09.359 align:start position:0%
um these machines while they've been
 
03:30:11.090 --> 03:30:11.100 align:start position:0%
characterized as video Lottery terminals
 
03:30:13.729 --> 03:30:13.739 align:start position:0%
slot machines they're not as popular not
 
03:30:13.739 --> 03:30:14.510 align:start position:0%
slot machines they're not as popular not
as

03:30:14.510 --> 03:30:14.520 align:start position:0%
as
 
03:30:16.370 --> 03:30:16.380 align:start position:0%
they're just not as popular to Gamblers
 
03:30:19.550 --> 03:30:19.560 align:start position:0%
as a casino machine would be uh and so
 
03:30:22.309 --> 03:30:22.319 align:start position:0%
there's a natural limit to it I would
 
03:30:25.910 --> 03:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
somewhere on 1500 Statewide mostly in
 
03:30:27.469 --> 03:30:27.479 align:start position:0%
the South and so you're not going to
 
03:30:29.269 --> 03:30:29.279 align:start position:0%
have a proliferation because the
 
03:30:31.309 --> 03:30:31.319 align:start position:0%
Market's not going to support it these
 
03:30:33.290 --> 03:30:33.300 align:start position:0%
things are very expensive to run are
 
03:30:35.389 --> 03:30:35.399 align:start position:0%
regulations that govern the management
 
03:30:36.530 --> 03:30:36.540 align:start position:0%
of these
 
03:30:39.349 --> 03:30:39.359 align:start position:0%
it's it's a seven-figure investment just
 
03:30:41.389 --> 03:30:41.399 align:start position:0%
in complying with our rules for getting
 
03:30:43.550 --> 03:30:43.560 align:start position:0%
the building the cost the labor all
 
03:30:45.349 --> 03:30:45.359 align:start position:0%
those things and so I would imagine
 
03:30:46.250 --> 03:30:46.260 align:start position:0%
you're not going to see the
 
03:30:48.170 --> 03:30:48.180 align:start position:0%
proliferation that folks would fear
 
03:30:54.769 --> 03:30:54.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:56.120 --> 03:30:56.130 align:start position:0%
I'm all free
 
03:30:56.130 --> 03:30:59.929 align:start position:0%
I'm all free
[Laughter]

03:30:59.929 --> 03:30:59.939 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
03:31:01.429 --> 03:31:01.439 align:start position:0%
Mick thank you very much thank you Mr
 
03:31:02.809 --> 03:31:02.819 align:start position:0%
committee and they said you want to
 
03:31:04.670 --> 03:31:04.680 align:start position:0%
follow up any questions happy to answer
 
03:31:06.590 --> 03:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
um uh going forward
 
03:31:08.630 --> 03:31:08.640 align:start position:0%
thank you so much
 
03:31:08.640 --> 03:31:17.170 align:start position:0%
thank you so much
tried

03:31:17.170 --> 03:31:17.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:20.510 --> 03:31:20.520 align:start position:0%
can I ask a procedure a question Vicky
 
03:31:23.269 --> 03:31:23.279 align:start position:0%
if we can we
 
03:31:27.110 --> 03:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
I just signed off on hb1
 
03:31:30.050 --> 03:31:30.060 align:start position:0%
now that it's not once it's fully signed
 
03:31:32.630 --> 03:31:32.640 align:start position:0%
off and it's in the House's hands can we
 
03:31:35.090 --> 03:31:35.100 align:start position:0%
make changes to hb1 in this committee
 
03:31:36.710 --> 03:31:36.720 align:start position:0%
can we recommend changes to one
 
03:31:38.630 --> 03:31:38.640 align:start position:0%
absolutely that's what we're any of the
 
03:31:40.370 --> 03:31:40.380 align:start position:0%
Motions that we do that I'll compile
 
03:31:43.070 --> 03:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
will ultimately be our proposed
 
03:31:44.510 --> 03:31:44.520 align:start position:0%
amendments to House Bill one and house
 
03:31:48.050 --> 03:31:48.060 align:start position:0%
bill 2. so but I guess let me
 
03:31:50.389 --> 03:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
does it have to go through two to get to
 
03:31:52.550 --> 03:31:52.560 align:start position:0%
one or can we go directly to one no
 
03:31:54.229 --> 03:31:54.239 align:start position:0%
they're separate bills so we amend so
 
03:31:57.590 --> 03:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
for instance the classline error that
 
03:31:59.750 --> 03:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
the Lottery Commission just stated on
 
03:32:03.349 --> 03:32:03.359 align:start position:0%
the uh the what is it the responsible
 
03:32:05.750 --> 03:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
gaming right uh Council so this
 
03:32:08.510 --> 03:32:08.520 align:start position:0%
committee can make a vote to make that
 
03:32:09.950 --> 03:32:09.960 align:start position:0%
change and then I would just compile
 
03:32:11.750 --> 03:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
that and all the changes that I'm that
 
03:32:14.330 --> 03:32:14.340 align:start position:0%
I'm making uh for now until we hit our
 
03:32:16.729 --> 03:32:16.739 align:start position:0%
deadline so like that's something you
 
03:32:19.309 --> 03:32:19.319 align:start position:0%
can do now we're still in work session
 
03:32:21.650 --> 03:32:21.660 align:start position:0%
um if you wanted to do that to authorize
 
03:32:23.870 --> 03:32:23.880 align:start position:0%
to approve that that requested change
 
03:32:25.849 --> 03:32:25.859 align:start position:0%
we're going to receive one more change
 
03:32:27.830 --> 03:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
he had talked about that Software System
 
03:32:30.050 --> 03:32:30.060 align:start position:0%
uh they're going to give us details to
 
03:32:31.190 --> 03:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
that which they didn't have with them
 
03:32:33.229 --> 03:32:33.239 align:start position:0%
today so once we get that that'll be
 
03:32:35.210 --> 03:32:35.220 align:start position:0%
another item that you could consider for
 
03:32:36.590 --> 03:32:36.600 align:start position:0%
lottery as well
 
03:32:38.269 --> 03:32:38.279 align:start position:0%
so we could take it up after the next
 
03:32:38.279 --> 03:32:39.650 align:start position:0%
so we could take it up after the next
after

03:32:39.650 --> 03:32:39.660 align:start position:0%
after
 
03:32:41.929 --> 03:32:41.939 align:start position:0%
certainly anytime yeah we're in session
 
03:32:43.969 --> 03:32:43.979 align:start position:0%
now uh until two and then police
 
03:32:46.309 --> 03:32:46.319 align:start position:0%
standards is in at two o'clock so
 
03:32:46.319 --> 03:32:47.990 align:start position:0%
standards is in at two o'clock so
anytime

03:32:47.990 --> 03:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
anytime
 
03:32:49.969 --> 03:32:49.979 align:start position:0%
get Harry back in here we could take a
 
03:32:55.429 --> 03:32:55.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:57.650 --> 03:32:57.660 align:start position:0%
this is a very uh this is about the
 
03:32:59.389 --> 03:32:59.399 align:start position:0%
easiest thing the committee will do so
 
03:33:00.950 --> 03:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
it's a good practice I guess for process
 
03:33:04.849 --> 03:33:04.859 align:start position:0%
so but does it take to take a
 
03:33:06.530 --> 03:33:06.540 align:start position:0%
kind of be a show of hands or does it
 
03:33:08.809 --> 03:33:08.819 align:start position:0%
have to be yeah okay yeah I mean we can
 
03:33:11.929 --> 03:33:11.939 align:start position:0%
the clerk can usually take a uh a vote
 
03:33:13.670 --> 03:33:13.680 align:start position:0%
and just to show hands is fine and then
 
03:33:16.250 --> 03:33:16.260 align:start position:0%
I'll all of those affirmative actions
 
03:33:18.170 --> 03:33:18.180 align:start position:0%
that the committee takes I will compile
 
03:33:20.450 --> 03:33:20.460 align:start position:0%
those with my changes right through okay
 
03:33:24.050 --> 03:33:24.060 align:start position:0%
uh yeah foreign
 
03:33:26.150 --> 03:33:26.160 align:start position:0%
yeah this is a technical correction
 
03:33:26.160 --> 03:33:34.990 align:start position:0%
yeah this is a technical correction
really

03:33:34.990 --> 03:33:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:39.830 --> 03:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
so yeah you can see the 250 000 per year
 
03:33:42.590 --> 03:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
was it should just be in class 102 not
 
03:33:44.269 --> 03:33:44.279 align:start position:0%
class 70. so that's the change they were
 
03:33:48.590 --> 03:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:51.530 --> 03:33:51.540 align:start position:0%
if you would say that one more time
 
03:33:54.349 --> 03:33:54.359 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about is
 
03:33:56.929 --> 03:33:56.939 align:start position:0%
taking a vote on an administrative
 
03:33:58.550 --> 03:33:58.560 align:start position:0%
change in the
 
03:34:00.530 --> 03:34:00.540 align:start position:0%
there's a technical correction here on
 
03:34:04.429 --> 03:34:04.439 align:start position:0%
page 1211 of the governor's Budget on
 
03:34:07.370 --> 03:34:07.380 align:start position:0%
accounting unit 8054 you can see that
 
03:34:10.429 --> 03:34:10.439 align:start position:0%
there's 250 000 per year in class 70.
 
03:34:12.650 --> 03:34:12.660 align:start position:0%
that should be in class 102 and the
 
03:34:13.910 --> 03:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
Lottery Commission had asked that we
 
03:34:18.229 --> 03:34:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:20.929 --> 03:34:20.939 align:start position:0%
okay do you have a motion to that effect
 
03:34:23.809 --> 03:34:23.819 align:start position:0%
move by Mary secretary by Joe all those
 
03:34:26.210 --> 03:34:26.220 align:start position:0%
in favor please raise your hands
 
03:34:30.650 --> 03:34:30.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:32.750 --> 03:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
no yeah well we didn't need to do a roll
 
03:34:34.309 --> 03:34:34.319 align:start position:0%
call on it we can do a show of hands but
 
03:34:35.870 --> 03:34:35.880 align:start position:0%
I think you have to fill out a yeah
 
03:34:38.650 --> 03:34:38.660 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to take my paper
 
03:34:42.170 --> 03:34:42.180 align:start position:0%
I mean it's it's these are all just uh
 
03:34:43.849 --> 03:34:43.859 align:start position:0%
recommendations I guess for me to put
 
03:34:44.870 --> 03:34:44.880 align:start position:0%
together your final vote on
 
03:34:46.130 --> 03:34:46.140 align:start position:0%
recommendation on all of your
 
03:34:47.630 --> 03:34:47.640 align:start position:0%
recommendations I'll be at the end okay
 
03:34:49.370 --> 03:34:49.380 align:start position:0%
so we don't so I mean it's it's up to
 
03:34:50.870 --> 03:34:50.880 align:start position:0%
the clerk if he wants to take notes of
 
03:34:53.389 --> 03:34:53.399 align:start position:0%
these small uh motions as they're going
 
03:34:53.399 --> 03:34:55.910 align:start position:0%
these small uh motions as they're going
along

03:34:55.910 --> 03:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:57.650 --> 03:34:57.660 align:start position:0%
and I will say as we get into some of
 
03:34:59.030 --> 03:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
the other agencies here we're going to
 
03:35:00.950 --> 03:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
get more technical requests to make so
 
03:35:02.809 --> 03:35:02.819 align:start position:0%
some keying errors may be occurred
 
03:35:04.610 --> 03:35:04.620 align:start position:0%
they've noticed things that once the
 
03:35:05.990 --> 03:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
governor's budget came out oh that's the

any questions that anyone might have
 
04:12:39.410 --> 04:12:39.420 align:start position:0%
I have one question on uh
 
04:12:42.170 --> 04:12:42.180 align:start position:0%
the program is not funded Beyond doj
 
04:12:44.510 --> 04:12:44.520 align:start position:0%
grant that will expire at the end of 23.
 
04:12:46.729 --> 04:12:46.739 align:start position:0%
it's one of the hires that you're
 
04:12:48.650 --> 04:12:48.660 align:start position:0%
talking about going to do with that
 
04:12:51.189 --> 04:12:51.199 align:start position:0%
which is not being funded anymore
 
04:12:53.750 --> 04:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh thank you very much for that question
 
04:12:57.950 --> 04:12:57.960 align:start position:0%
and it's an excellent segue for and the
 
04:12:59.929 --> 04:12:59.939 align:start position:0%
one ask that we have that's beyond what
 
04:13:01.490 --> 04:13:01.500 align:start position:0%
I've submitted well I gave you the
 
04:13:04.790 --> 04:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
softball thank you yeah
 
04:13:08.510 --> 04:13:08.520 align:start position:0%
um that uh that doj Grant was to
 
04:13:11.870 --> 04:13:11.880 align:start position:0%
establish a state level accreditation
 
04:13:15.130 --> 04:13:15.140 align:start position:0%
program that is voluntary in nature
 
04:13:19.309 --> 04:13:19.319 align:start position:0%
uh we had hopes of using the doj grant
 
04:13:22.429 --> 04:13:22.439 align:start position:0%
to fund a contracted position who could
 
04:13:24.590 --> 04:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
oversee the program
 
04:13:28.370 --> 04:13:28.380 align:start position:0%
uh the uh the person that is mentioned
 
04:13:32.450 --> 04:13:32.460 align:start position:0%
in my presentation would be more of a
 
04:13:35.210 --> 04:13:35.220 align:start position:0%
Administrative Assistant uh position to
 
04:13:38.990 --> 04:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
help with uh the the volume of calls and
 
04:13:40.910 --> 04:13:40.920 align:start position:0%
paperwork and things like that are going
 
04:13:43.670 --> 04:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
to have to be spoken to
 
04:13:43.680 --> 04:13:44.210 align:start position:0%
to have to be spoken to
um

04:13:44.210 --> 04:13:44.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:46.990 --> 04:13:47.000 align:start position:0%
the the ask
 
04:13:50.870 --> 04:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
would be for consideration of an
 
04:13:53.510 --> 04:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
additional seventy five thousand dollars
 
04:13:55.550 --> 04:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
per fiscal year
 
04:13:59.090 --> 04:13:59.100 align:start position:0%
to help us really strongly establish
 
04:14:01.070 --> 04:14:01.080 align:start position:0%
this accreditation program which is
 
04:14:02.929 --> 04:14:02.939 align:start position:0%
brand new here in the state of New
 
04:14:02.939 --> 04:14:04.550 align:start position:0%
brand new here in the state of New
Hampshire

04:14:04.550 --> 04:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:14:07.070 --> 04:14:07.080 align:start position:0%
um we really want this to be successful
 
04:14:11.809 --> 04:14:11.819 align:start position:0%
and our initial Hope was to try to have
 
04:14:13.490 --> 04:14:13.500 align:start position:0%
the the accreditation program
 
04:14:13.500 --> 04:14:15.469 align:start position:0%
the the accreditation program
self-funded

04:14:15.469 --> 04:14:15.479 align:start position:0%
self-funded
 
04:14:20.689 --> 04:14:20.699 align:start position:0%
through uh application fees uh but I I
 
04:14:23.510 --> 04:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that fiscally
 
04:14:27.469 --> 04:14:27.479 align:start position:0%
we're able to uh kind of close the deal
 
04:14:30.469 --> 04:14:30.479 align:start position:0%
as we roll this program out and I don't
 
04:14:32.389 --> 04:14:32.399 align:start position:0%
know that we're going to generate enough
 
04:14:35.269 --> 04:14:35.279 align:start position:0%
money uh coming back in
 
04:14:39.170 --> 04:14:39.180 align:start position:0%
to help offset the cost of a contractor
 
04:14:41.269 --> 04:14:41.279 align:start position:0%
to oversee our program
 
04:14:45.110 --> 04:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
and that would be the 75 would be in
 
04:14:46.910 --> 04:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
addition to the presentation that I just
 
04:14:46.920 --> 04:14:50.269 align:start position:0%

there were so many recommendations and
 
04:15:07.370 --> 04:15:07.380 align:start position:0%
you had a lot of work to do readjusting
 
04:15:09.469 --> 04:15:09.479 align:start position:0%
your curriculum and making sure
 
04:15:11.510 --> 04:15:11.520 align:start position:0%

was a big big lift uh I am so fortunate
 
04:15:38.330 --> 04:15:38.340 align:start position:0%
that uh I am surrounded by people at
 
04:15:40.189 --> 04:15:40.199 align:start position:0%
police stands in training that really
 
04:15:43.309 --> 04:15:43.319 align:start position:0%
make me very successful because they do
 
04:15:46.429 --> 04:15:46.439 align:start position:0%
all the heavy lifting uh we were able to
 
04:15:50.150 --> 04:15:50.160 align:start position:0%
accomplish about 90 of what liak was
 
04:15:52.729 --> 04:15:52.739 align:start position:0%
asking us to do we have a couple of
 
04:15:55.729 --> 04:15:55.739 align:start position:0%
small pieces that are still uh being
 
04:16:00.349 --> 04:16:00.359 align:start position:0%
worked on uh but my staff uh really uh
 
04:16:03.889 --> 04:16:03.899 align:start position:0%
did a phenomenal job and uh created a
 
04:16:05.510 --> 04:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of content that was
 
04:16:10.030 --> 04:16:10.040 align:start position:0%
necessary we realigned uh the curriculum
 
04:16:13.490 --> 04:16:13.500 align:start position:0%
we are looking towards the future in
 
04:16:16.189 --> 04:16:16.199 align:start position:0%
terms of making sure that New Hampshire
 
04:16:18.830 --> 04:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
is setting the bar for training of law
 
04:16:21.349 --> 04:16:21.359 align:start position:0%
enforcement officers uh not just you
 
04:16:23.030 --> 04:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
know in New England but across the
 
04:16:26.450 --> 04:16:26.460 align:start position:0%
country and we're very excited we we
 
04:16:29.570 --> 04:16:29.580 align:start position:0%
take that challenge on uh very excited
 
04:16:32.330 --> 04:16:32.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:34.550 --> 04:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
I live in Manchester and we have a
 
04:16:36.590 --> 04:16:36.600 align:start position:0%
fabulous police chief he's she's the
 
04:16:39.349 --> 04:16:39.359 align:start position:0%
best but we also really have a hard time
 
04:16:41.870 --> 04:16:41.880 align:start position:0%
recruiting police officers it's not a
 
04:16:44.090 --> 04:16:44.100 align:start position:0%
job people want to do anymore
 
04:16:47.330 --> 04:16:47.340 align:start position:0%
um what what can we do or what I are we
 
04:16:50.150 --> 04:16:50.160 align:start position:0%
doing as a state to um even your own
 
04:16:52.670 --> 04:16:52.680 align:start position:0%
Troopers it's it's hard to get people
 
04:16:56.330 --> 04:16:56.340 align:start position:0%
who who are willing to get out there uh
 
04:16:57.710 --> 04:16:57.720 align:start position:0%
there are more guns out there there's
 
04:17:00.050 --> 04:17:00.060 align:start position:0%
more risk uh people don't know when they
 
04:17:01.670 --> 04:17:01.680 align:start position:0%
stop somebody if it's going to be
 
04:17:04.610 --> 04:17:04.620 align:start position:0%
something more than they anticipated so
 
04:17:06.889 --> 04:17:06.899 align:start position:0%
what can we it's such a critical thing
 
04:17:09.469 --> 04:17:09.479 align:start position:0%
how can we help this or what what can we
 
04:17:09.479 --> 04:17:10.429 align:start position:0%
how can we help this or what what can we
do

04:17:10.429 --> 04:17:10.439 align:start position:0%
do
 
04:17:13.670 --> 04:17:13.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question this uh I
 
04:17:16.370 --> 04:17:16.380 align:start position:0%
had the occasion to be in Washington DC
 
04:17:18.349 --> 04:17:18.359 align:start position:0%
uh this last weekend
 
04:17:21.469 --> 04:17:21.479 align:start position:0%
and uh I'm part of a project with the
 
04:17:23.210 --> 04:17:23.220 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice and the Bureau of
 
04:17:26.929 --> 04:17:26.939 align:start position:0%
Justice assistance to help uh create a
 
04:17:29.030 --> 04:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
nationwide constitutional policing
 
04:17:31.550 --> 04:17:31.560 align:start position:0%
curriculum that allowed me an
 
04:17:33.050 --> 04:17:33.060 align:start position:0%
opportunity to sit down and talk with
 
04:17:35.150 --> 04:17:35.160 align:start position:0%
some of my my peers from across the
 
04:17:35.160 --> 04:17:35.889 align:start position:0%
some of my my peers from across the
country

04:17:35.889 --> 04:17:35.899 align:start position:0%
country
 
04:17:38.269 --> 04:17:38.279 align:start position:0%
what we are seeing here in New Hampshire
 
04:17:38.279 --> 04:17:40.130 align:start position:0%
what we are seeing here in New Hampshire
is

04:17:40.130 --> 04:17:40.140 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:17:42.830 --> 04:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
is candidly not nearly as bad as what
 
04:17:44.389 --> 04:17:44.399 align:start position:0%
other parts of the country are seeing
 
04:17:46.610 --> 04:17:46.620 align:start position:0%
with regard to Recruitment and Retention
 
04:17:46.620 --> 04:17:48.410 align:start position:0%
with regard to Recruitment and Retention
issues

04:17:48.410 --> 04:17:48.420 align:start position:0%
issues
 
04:17:51.830 --> 04:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
uh nonetheless New Hampshire's very much
 
04:17:55.550 --> 04:17:55.560 align:start position:0%
in that mix we're we're suffering
 
04:17:58.550 --> 04:17:58.560 align:start position:0%
from those problems as well
 
04:18:02.630 --> 04:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
the sad truth is that where we are not
 
04:18:04.429 --> 04:18:04.439 align:start position:0%
getting people
 
04:18:08.090 --> 04:18:08.100 align:start position:0%
uh that that are really Forward Thinking
 
04:18:12.370 --> 04:18:12.380 align:start position:0%
and and uh could really bring some some
 
04:18:15.410 --> 04:18:15.420 align:start position:0%
tremendous change to our industry
 
04:18:19.189 --> 04:18:19.199 align:start position:0%
because they don't want to
 
04:18:23.809 --> 04:18:23.819 align:start position:0%
face uh the daunting task of being a
 
04:18:26.269 --> 04:18:26.279 align:start position:0%
police officer it is it is a challenge
 
04:18:29.150 --> 04:18:29.160 align:start position:0%
that is uh many people just don't want
 
04:18:30.950 --> 04:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
anything to do with now
 
04:18:34.189 --> 04:18:34.199 align:start position:0%
there's a general feeling that
 
04:18:34.199 --> 04:18:35.150 align:start position:0%
there's a general feeling that
um

04:18:35.150 --> 04:18:35.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:18:37.849 --> 04:18:37.859 align:start position:0%
there's really no support uh from the
 
04:18:39.650 --> 04:18:39.660 align:start position:0%
communities that they serve
 
04:18:41.870 --> 04:18:41.880 align:start position:0%
there's probably some concern that
 
04:18:43.070 --> 04:18:43.080 align:start position:0%
they're not supported by their own
 
04:18:43.080 --> 04:18:45.349 align:start position:0%
they're not supported by their own
agencies

04:18:45.349 --> 04:18:45.359 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
04:18:47.870 --> 04:18:47.880 align:start position:0%
um they're afraid that they're going to
 
04:18:49.790 --> 04:18:49.800 align:start position:0%
have to make a decision that they will
 
04:18:54.050 --> 04:18:54.060 align:start position:0%
be vilified for later on
 
04:18:55.670 --> 04:18:55.680 align:start position:0%
even though it's a hundred percent
 
04:18:58.070 --> 04:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
correct decision
 
04:18:58.080 --> 04:18:59.389 align:start position:0%
correct decision
uh

04:18:59.389 --> 04:18:59.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:19:01.849 --> 04:19:01.859 align:start position:0%
I've been in law enforcement for almost
 
04:19:05.689 --> 04:19:05.699 align:start position:0%
40 years now and I I have never seen it
 
04:19:08.330 --> 04:19:08.340 align:start position:0%
like this before ever
 
04:19:10.189 --> 04:19:10.199 align:start position:0%
uh it is
 
04:19:10.199 --> 04:19:10.910 align:start position:0%
uh it is
um

04:19:10.910 --> 04:19:10.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:19:12.590 --> 04:19:12.600 align:start position:0%
I don't believe it's a problem that's
 
04:19:16.570 --> 04:19:16.580 align:start position:0%
going away anytime soon
 
04:19:18.769 --> 04:19:18.779 align:start position:0%
we only need to look here in New
 
04:19:20.330 --> 04:19:20.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire where you know we're looking
 
04:19:22.849 --> 04:19:22.859 align:start position:0%
at Staffing deficits that are crushing
 
04:19:25.370 --> 04:19:25.380 align:start position:0%
uh Department of Corrections crushing
 
04:19:27.170 --> 04:19:27.180 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire State Police crushing
 
04:19:28.849 --> 04:19:28.859 align:start position:0%
right now
 
04:19:32.510 --> 04:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
um I don't know the answer we we
 
04:19:34.490 --> 04:19:34.500 align:start position:0%
collectively in our business have done
 
04:19:36.490 --> 04:19:36.500 align:start position:0%
everything we can
 
04:19:39.010 --> 04:19:39.020 align:start position:0%
to try to
 
04:19:42.410 --> 04:19:42.420 align:start position:0%
recruit people uh actively going out
 
04:19:43.790 --> 04:19:43.800 align:start position:0%
there and recruiting like I've never
 
04:19:46.550 --> 04:19:46.560 align:start position:0%
seen before in our business and I just I
 
04:19:48.650 --> 04:19:48.660 align:start position:0%
don't know what that answer is
 
04:19:52.729 --> 04:19:52.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:55.070 --> 04:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for you
 
04:19:57.769 --> 04:19:57.779 align:start position:0%
know answering questions and frankly for
 
04:20:00.229 --> 04:20:00.239 align:start position:0%
the work you do it's really tough
 
04:20:02.330 --> 04:20:02.340 align:start position:0%
I I would State on the record that I
 
04:20:04.189 --> 04:20:04.199 align:start position:0%
don't think that the concern for safety
 
04:20:05.870 --> 04:20:05.880 align:start position:0%
in terms of coming to New Hampshire to
 
04:20:07.849 --> 04:20:07.859 align:start position:0%
be a police officer is a big concern we
 
04:20:09.530 --> 04:20:09.540 align:start position:0%
are either the safest or the second
 
04:20:11.269 --> 04:20:11.279 align:start position:0%
safest state in the country overall
 
04:20:13.729 --> 04:20:13.739 align:start position:0%
police work is still dangerous you know
 
04:20:16.070 --> 04:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
but relative to other states it
 
04:20:18.290 --> 04:20:18.300 align:start position:0%
shouldn't really be a big deal and also
 
04:20:20.389 --> 04:20:20.399 align:start position:0%
you know I'm from Windham and God knows
 
04:20:22.670 --> 04:20:22.680 align:start position:0%
we support our police department and yet
 
04:20:25.189 --> 04:20:25.199 align:start position:0%
we cannot find we have an open position
 
04:20:27.290 --> 04:20:27.300 align:start position:0%
we haven't been able to file for a while
 
04:20:30.830 --> 04:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
you were mentioning concerns about you
 
04:20:32.630 --> 04:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
know being vilified if you make a bad
 
04:20:32.640 --> 04:20:33.710 align:start position:0%
know being vilified if you make a bad
decision

04:20:33.710 --> 04:20:33.720 align:start position:0%
decision
 
04:20:35.570 --> 04:20:35.580 align:start position:0%
I remember reading and again this is not
 
04:20:37.250 --> 04:20:37.260 align:start position:0%
about New Hampshire police it's just
 
04:20:39.530 --> 04:20:39.540 align:start position:0%
general knowledge I remember reading
 
04:20:42.170 --> 04:20:42.180 align:start position:0%
that at some point the training was
 
04:20:44.330 --> 04:20:44.340 align:start position:0%
you know rather aggressive in how they
 
04:20:46.849 --> 04:20:46.859 align:start position:0%
should handle situations and now we are
 
04:20:49.130 --> 04:20:49.140 align:start position:0%
adjusting the training to focus more on
 
04:20:51.830 --> 04:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
de-escalating and trying to
 
04:20:54.349 --> 04:20:54.359 align:start position:0%
is that something that we need to do you
 
04:20:56.809 --> 04:20:56.819 align:start position:0%
know continuing down on that path with
 
04:20:59.090 --> 04:20:59.100 align:start position:0%
that help in the longer term means some
 
04:21:00.950 --> 04:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
of those pressures do you think that's
 
04:21:03.170 --> 04:21:03.180 align:start position:0%
part of the solution and seriously what
 
04:21:05.090 --> 04:21:05.100 align:start position:0%
can we do to help in creating whatever
 
04:21:07.849 --> 04:21:07.859 align:start position:0%
regulatory framework or anything that
 
04:21:10.070 --> 04:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
would make it possible for the agency to
 
04:21:12.170 --> 04:21:12.180 align:start position:0%
you know find the right people who do
 
04:21:13.610 --> 04:21:13.620 align:start position:0%
the right job I mean at the end of the
 
04:21:16.550 --> 04:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
day we all need Public Safety and you
 
04:21:18.469 --> 04:21:18.479 align:start position:0%
know what what can we do I'm you know
 
04:21:20.389 --> 04:21:20.399 align:start position:0%
I'm not an expert on those
 
04:21:23.870 --> 04:21:23.880 align:start position:0%
thank you sir for that question I I I
 
04:21:27.110 --> 04:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
wish I had that answer I don't know
 
04:21:29.689 --> 04:21:29.699 align:start position:0%
um there's there's a lot of theories out
 
04:21:32.210 --> 04:21:32.220 align:start position:0%
there these are not my positions I'll
 
04:21:34.070 --> 04:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
just relate to you what I have heard you
 
04:21:37.490 --> 04:21:37.500 align:start position:0%
know from my peers uh there is uh you
 
04:21:41.090 --> 04:21:41.100 align:start position:0%
know the question of of uh you know
 
04:21:43.670 --> 04:21:43.680 align:start position:0%
should police officers be uh more
 
04:21:46.250 --> 04:21:46.260 align:start position:0%
heavily compensated right if we want to
 
04:21:48.530 --> 04:21:48.540 align:start position:0%
really professionalize do they need more
 
04:21:48.540 --> 04:21:49.429 align:start position:0%
really professionalize do they need more
money

04:21:49.429 --> 04:21:49.439 align:start position:0%
money
 
04:21:49.439 --> 04:21:51.309 align:start position:0%
money
uh

04:21:51.309 --> 04:21:51.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:21:55.189 --> 04:21:55.199 align:start position:0%
better equipment uh better connection to
 
04:21:57.110 --> 04:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
the community
 
04:21:57.120 --> 04:21:57.710 align:start position:0%
the community
um

04:21:57.710 --> 04:21:57.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:01.309 --> 04:22:01.319 align:start position:0%
you know it when you're faced with a job
 
04:22:03.889 --> 04:22:03.899 align:start position:0%
that requires you to work uh
 
04:22:07.370 --> 04:22:07.380 align:start position:0%
nights weekends and holidays versus I
 
04:22:09.969 --> 04:22:09.979 align:start position:0%
can take a job in Boston working for a
 
04:22:12.830 --> 04:22:12.840 align:start position:0%
private firm and make make better money
 
04:22:15.410 --> 04:22:15.420 align:start position:0%
and nobody's going to try and hurt me
 
04:22:17.809 --> 04:22:17.819 align:start position:0%
and I do agree with you this is a very
 
04:22:20.870 --> 04:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
safe place to work as a police officer I
 
04:22:23.469 --> 04:22:23.479 align:start position:0%
I absolutely agree with you
 
04:22:27.469 --> 04:22:27.479 align:start position:0%
uh I just don't know that answer and I I
 
04:22:29.210 --> 04:22:29.220 align:start position:0%
wish I did and that and this is a
 
04:22:30.710 --> 04:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
question that is asked across the
 
04:22:33.349 --> 04:22:33.359 align:start position:0%
country what can we do to
 
04:22:38.530 --> 04:22:38.540 align:start position:0%
to recruit people uh really smart uh
 
04:22:41.330 --> 04:22:41.340 align:start position:0%
forward-thinking people uh who are going
 
04:22:43.269 --> 04:22:43.279 align:start position:0%
to stay in the business for a long time
 
04:22:45.889 --> 04:22:45.899 align:start position:0%
seriously I would appreciate you know if
 
04:22:47.689 --> 04:22:47.699 align:start position:0%

proactively and see again if a strategy
 
04:22:55.790 --> 04:22:55.800 align:start position:0%
comes up that you know we could
 
04:22:57.710 --> 04:22:57.720 align:start position:0%
Implement from a policy I know now we're
 
04:23:00.290 --> 04:23:00.300 align:start position:0%
talking budget but obviously the budget
 
04:23:01.969 --> 04:23:01.979 align:start position:0%
issues are gonna be influenced by
 
04:23:04.670 --> 04:23:04.680 align:start position:0%
policies so you know please stay you
 
04:23:07.189 --> 04:23:07.199 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
04:23:16.670 --> 04:23:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:18.229 --> 04:23:18.239 align:start position:0%
handstrong leadership position in the
 
04:23:20.330 --> 04:23:20.340 align:start position:0%
state and I recall it one of our recent
 
04:23:23.570 --> 04:23:23.580 align:start position:0%
Town budget hearings he spoke about the
 
04:23:25.809 --> 04:23:25.819 align:start position:0%
fact that many of the new police academy
 
04:23:28.490 --> 04:23:28.500 align:start position:0%
uh like trainees who make it through
 
04:23:30.110 --> 04:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
their program
 
04:23:33.050 --> 04:23:33.060 align:start position:0%
either fail the written exam or don't
 
04:23:35.090 --> 04:23:35.100 align:start position:0%
pass the background check
 
04:23:38.450 --> 04:23:38.460 align:start position:0%
um so I'm wondering you know from
 
04:23:41.030 --> 04:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
hearing that description there must be
 
04:23:44.570 --> 04:23:44.580 align:start position:0%
some sort of cost savings to be had from
 
04:23:47.450 --> 04:23:47.460 align:start position:0%
running the background check prior to
 
04:23:49.429 --> 04:23:49.439 align:start position:0%
the Academy training and sitting for the
 
04:23:50.990 --> 04:23:51.000 align:start position:0%
exam so that we're not losing someone
 
04:23:53.570 --> 04:23:53.580 align:start position:0%
after investing that important
 
04:23:56.210 --> 04:23:56.220 align:start position:0%
um resource into you know studying these
 
04:23:57.650 --> 04:23:57.660 align:start position:0%
folks up and getting them ready to go
 
04:24:00.170 --> 04:24:00.180 align:start position:0%
you know if we could save money on the
 
04:24:01.790 --> 04:24:01.800 align:start position:0%
front end by not putting them through
 
04:24:03.170 --> 04:24:03.180 align:start position:0%
their program if we already know they're
 
04:24:04.849 --> 04:24:04.859 align:start position:0%
going to fail the test uh the background
 
04:24:06.590 --> 04:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
check right
 
04:24:10.130 --> 04:24:10.140 align:start position:0%
so uh I've had the distinct pleasure of
 
04:24:11.630 --> 04:24:11.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I've had the
 
04:24:13.610 --> 04:24:13.620 align:start position:0%
distinct pleasure for who would uh Chief
 
04:24:16.010 --> 04:24:16.020 align:start position:0%
Dennis he's a great guy and a really
 
04:24:17.630 --> 04:24:17.640 align:start position:0%
strong police leader here in New
 
04:24:22.189 --> 04:24:22.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in fact uh the recruit will
 
04:24:25.969 --> 04:24:25.979 align:start position:0%
not attend the academy until they pass a
 
04:24:28.790 --> 04:24:28.800 align:start position:0%
full background check to include a
 
04:24:32.870 --> 04:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
psychological exam a medical exam a
 
04:24:36.349 --> 04:24:36.359 align:start position:0%
polygraph exam and uh and that full
 
04:24:38.210 --> 04:24:38.220 align:start position:0%
background where we we talked to past
 
04:24:40.670 --> 04:24:40.680 align:start position:0%
employers and and family members and
 
04:24:42.710 --> 04:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
just really make sure that they're not
 
04:24:44.689 --> 04:24:44.699 align:start position:0%
bringing any kind of you know bad habits
 
04:24:46.130 --> 04:24:46.140 align:start position:0%
or criminal Behavior or anything like
 
04:24:49.670 --> 04:24:49.680 align:start position:0%
that uh so no they they will not attend
 
04:24:53.330 --> 04:24:53.340 align:start position:0%
the academy until that check is done for
 
04:24:55.490 --> 04:24:55.500 align:start position:0%
that very reason yeah the unfortunate
 
04:24:58.370 --> 04:24:58.380 align:start position:0%
truth is that at a base level
 
04:25:02.090 --> 04:25:02.100 align:start position:0%
uh Hanover PD will spend a lot of money
 
04:25:04.729 --> 04:25:04.739 align:start position:0%
on vetting that particular candidate
 
04:25:07.250 --> 04:25:07.260 align:start position:0%
then they may have spent over time on
 
04:25:09.349 --> 04:25:09.359 align:start position:0%
the background investigator put them
 
04:25:11.110 --> 04:25:11.120 align:start position:0%
through a medical test which costs money
 
04:25:13.790 --> 04:25:13.800 align:start position:0%
and a psych test and then all of a
 
04:25:15.050 --> 04:25:15.060 align:start position:0%
sudden something pops in their
 
04:25:15.060 --> 04:25:16.070 align:start position:0%
sudden something pops in their
background

04:25:16.070 --> 04:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
background
 
04:25:19.429 --> 04:25:19.439 align:start position:0%
and and you know Hanover PD is into that
 
04:25:21.650 --> 04:25:21.660 align:start position:0%
that particular candidate for you know
 
04:25:23.750 --> 04:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
maybe a thousand dollars and then they
 
04:25:27.469 --> 04:25:27.479 align:start position:0%
have to start again so it it is
 
04:25:27.479 --> 04:25:28.550 align:start position:0%
have to start again so it it is
um

04:25:28.550 --> 04:25:28.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:32.090 --> 04:25:32.100 align:start position:0%
it is frustrating I will tell you that
 
04:25:35.269 --> 04:25:35.279 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's hiring standards have
 
04:25:36.590 --> 04:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
not changed
 
04:25:39.530 --> 04:25:39.540 align:start position:0%
and as as long as I am
 
04:25:43.429 --> 04:25:43.439 align:start position:0%
where I'm at I I would strongly urge no
 
04:25:46.130 --> 04:25:46.140 align:start position:0%
changes to our hiring standards
 
04:25:49.070 --> 04:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
because when you do see hiring standards
 
04:25:49.080 --> 04:25:50.510 align:start position:0%
because when you do see hiring standards
lessened

04:25:50.510 --> 04:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
lessened
 
04:25:52.670 --> 04:25:52.680 align:start position:0%
that thousand dollars that Hanover spent
 
04:25:55.990 --> 04:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
is is Pennies on dollars compared to
 
04:25:59.330 --> 04:25:59.340 align:start position:0%
what what could happen you know by
 
04:26:02.149 --> 04:26:02.159 align:start position:0%
hiring somebody who should not be given
 
04:26:03.649 --> 04:26:03.659 align:start position:0%
this privilege to be a law enforcement
 
04:26:03.659 --> 04:26:07.670 align:start position:0%
this privilege to be a law enforcement
officer

04:26:07.670 --> 04:26:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:10.429 --> 04:26:10.439 align:start position:0%
thank you there was a time when you were
 
04:26:12.769 --> 04:26:12.779 align:start position:0%
getting older candidates going through
 
04:26:14.990 --> 04:26:15.000 align:start position:0%
are there still older people who are you
 
04:26:16.910 --> 04:26:16.920 align:start position:0%
know maybe perhaps a retired military
 
04:26:18.110 --> 04:26:18.120 align:start position:0%
um do you still get that sort of a
 
04:26:18.120 --> 04:26:19.130 align:start position:0%
um do you still get that sort of a
candidate

04:26:19.130 --> 04:26:19.140 align:start position:0%
candidate
 
04:26:21.290 --> 04:26:21.300 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question yes we do
 
04:26:24.710 --> 04:26:24.720 align:start position:0%
and um it's interesting not only do we
 
04:26:26.750 --> 04:26:26.760 align:start position:0%
get uh retired uh folks from the
 
04:26:30.170 --> 04:26:30.180 align:start position:0%
military who uh candidly do very very
 
04:26:32.149 --> 04:26:32.159 align:start position:0%
well in the academy setting and have
 
04:26:34.849 --> 04:26:34.859 align:start position:0%
great careers uh we're actually seeing
 
04:26:38.149 --> 04:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
uh older adults who may have owned their
 
04:26:41.149 --> 04:26:41.159 align:start position:0%
own business or worked in uh you know
 
04:26:43.849 --> 04:26:43.859 align:start position:0%
Private Industry for for a long period
 
04:26:46.370 --> 04:26:46.380 align:start position:0%
of time and then had this calling for
 
04:26:49.250 --> 04:26:49.260 align:start position:0%
public service and and so they do step
 
04:26:53.570 --> 04:26:53.580 align:start position:0%
up and and it is my opinion that the uh
 
04:26:55.370 --> 04:26:55.380 align:start position:0%
the ex the life experience that those
 
04:26:57.710 --> 04:26:57.720 align:start position:0%
folks bring to the table is is
 
04:26:59.750 --> 04:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
phenomenal and it makes them great
 
04:27:02.450 --> 04:27:02.460 align:start position:0%
officers because they they already have
 
04:27:04.610 --> 04:27:04.620 align:start position:0%
the interpersonal skills to be very
 
04:27:04.620 --> 04:27:08.809 align:start position:0%
the interpersonal skills to be very
successful

04:27:08.809 --> 04:27:08.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:10.429 --> 04:27:10.439 align:start position:0%
um when I was reading this or you were
 
04:27:11.689 --> 04:27:11.699 align:start position:0%
reading it to us
 
04:27:13.910 --> 04:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
um about SB 367
 
04:27:15.290 --> 04:27:15.300 align:start position:0%
um training Law Enforcement Officers
 
04:27:17.330 --> 04:27:17.340 align:start position:0%
Target of having at least one officer
 
04:27:19.309 --> 04:27:19.319 align:start position:0%
from every law enforcement agency in the
 
04:27:22.550 --> 04:27:22.560 align:start position:0%
state train I was either this is I'm
 
04:27:23.750 --> 04:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
04:27:25.370 --> 04:27:25.380 align:start position:0%
how did you Define law enforcement
 
04:27:26.870 --> 04:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
agency I'm either thinking this is too
 
04:27:28.729 --> 04:27:28.739 align:start position:0%
many people are not enough people and
 
04:27:30.170 --> 04:27:30.180 align:start position:0%
what brought to mind is that you know
 
04:27:32.689 --> 04:27:32.699 align:start position:0%
Newcastle probably does not need one if
 
04:27:34.370 --> 04:27:34.380 align:start position:0%
we're you know if you're defining that
 
04:27:35.870 --> 04:27:35.880 align:start position:0%
as a law enforcement agency so what do
 
04:27:37.910 --> 04:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
you mean by law enforcement agency
 
04:27:39.830 --> 04:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for that question yeah
 
04:27:44.149 --> 04:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
every single Police Department uh that's
 
04:27:47.870 --> 04:27:47.880 align:start position:0%
that's what the target is and um that uh
 
04:27:50.870 --> 04:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
that Target was set by the senator that
 
04:27:54.170 --> 04:27:54.180 align:start position:0%
had uh sponsored this bill uh that was
 
04:27:56.269 --> 04:27:56.279 align:start position:0%
his vision and
 
04:28:00.830 --> 04:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
um ultimately was signed into law I am
 
04:28:04.070 --> 04:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
very familiar with uh Newcastle I was a
 
04:28:07.070 --> 04:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
rye police officer for 12 years so we
 
04:28:09.590 --> 04:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
used to meet at Floyd's Corner a lot and
 
04:28:18.530 --> 04:28:18.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:20.870 --> 04:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I was just
 
04:28:22.429 --> 04:28:22.439 align:start position:0%
recalling that
 
04:28:22.439 --> 04:28:24.110 align:start position:0%
recalling that
um

04:28:24.110 --> 04:28:24.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:28:26.090 --> 04:28:26.100 align:start position:0%
the first day you had to shut everything
 
04:28:28.490 --> 04:28:28.500 align:start position:0%
down and it looks like you held up
 
04:28:30.469 --> 04:28:30.479 align:start position:0%
pretty well
 
04:28:30.479 --> 04:28:32.050 align:start position:0%
pretty well
hahaha

04:28:32.050 --> 04:28:32.060 align:start position:0%
hahaha
 
04:28:35.149 --> 04:28:35.159 align:start position:0%
you you are you are correct sir thank
 
04:28:39.649 --> 04:28:39.659 align:start position:0%
you uh my very first official uh act as
 
04:28:40.910 --> 04:28:40.920 align:start position:0%
the Director of New Hampshire law
 
04:28:43.070 --> 04:28:43.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement standards and training was
 
04:28:46.010 --> 04:28:46.020 align:start position:0%
to shut the building down and uh I
 
04:28:48.830 --> 04:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
introduced myself to the class
 
04:28:51.170 --> 04:28:51.180 align:start position:0%
I'm the new guy you have 15 minutes to
 
04:28:52.370 --> 04:28:52.380 align:start position:0%
go upstairs and get all your stuff and
 
04:28:53.870 --> 04:28:53.880 align:start position:0%
get out of here you're gonna go back to
 
04:28:57.290 --> 04:28:57.300 align:start position:0%
where you came from uh yes a little
 
04:29:00.130 --> 04:29:00.140 align:start position:0%
follow-up um
 
04:29:04.010 --> 04:29:04.020 align:start position:0%
there was one example that happened
 
04:29:04.020 --> 04:29:04.969 align:start position:0%
there was one example that happened
um

04:29:04.969 --> 04:29:04.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:29:08.689 --> 04:29:08.699 align:start position:0%
to prove that you know all New Hampshire
 
04:29:11.210 --> 04:29:11.220 align:start position:0%
law enforcement has the same training
 
04:29:13.550 --> 04:29:13.560 align:start position:0%
and I'm glad to see that I'm glad to
 
04:29:15.950 --> 04:29:15.960 align:start position:0%
have that and the one example to prove
 
04:29:17.870 --> 04:29:17.880 align:start position:0%
that how valuable that was was that
 
04:29:19.610 --> 04:29:19.620 align:start position:0%
disaster down in Texas where they had
 
04:29:22.189 --> 04:29:22.199 align:start position:0%
hundreds of law enforcement people are
 
04:29:24.530 --> 04:29:24.540 align:start position:0%
different all under different leadership
 
04:29:24.540 --> 04:29:25.729 align:start position:0%
different all under different leadership
and

04:29:25.729 --> 04:29:25.739 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:29:29.630 --> 04:29:29.640 align:start position:0%
got nowhere it was just to so I'm just I
 
04:29:32.570 --> 04:29:32.580 align:start position:0%
just want to thank you for having having
 
04:29:34.189 --> 04:29:34.199 align:start position:0%
what we have here in New Hampshire have
 
04:29:36.229 --> 04:29:36.239 align:start position:0%
all our law enforcement have the same
 
04:29:36.239 --> 04:29:37.550 align:start position:0%
all our law enforcement have the same
training

04:29:37.550 --> 04:29:37.560 align:start position:0%
training
 
04:29:40.070 --> 04:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
thank you sir and thank all of you for
 
04:29:42.710 --> 04:29:42.720 align:start position:0%
the for that support we are the Envy of
 
04:29:44.870 --> 04:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
uh I ran a police academy down in
 
04:29:46.969 --> 04:29:46.979 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts they Envy New Hampshire
 
04:29:48.889 --> 04:29:48.899 align:start position:0%
because of the way we do business as
 
04:29:51.290 --> 04:29:51.300 align:start position:0%
does a lot of states and we're very very
 
04:30:01.189 --> 04:30:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:03.170 --> 04:30:03.180 align:start position:0%
number of annual in-service training
 
04:30:05.389 --> 04:30:05.399 align:start position:0%
hours from 8 to 24 hours do you have
 
04:30:06.950 --> 04:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
funding for that where is that extra
 
04:30:08.450 --> 04:30:08.460 align:start position:0%
funding coming from how do you manage
 
04:30:11.630 --> 04:30:11.640 align:start position:0%
that thank you for that question uh this
 
04:30:14.929 --> 04:30:14.939 align:start position:0%
budget as proposed is is going to help
 
04:30:17.689 --> 04:30:17.699 align:start position:0%
us uh do that I think one of the things
 
04:30:19.969 --> 04:30:19.979 align:start position:0%
that we need to do at the police academy
 
04:30:23.630 --> 04:30:23.640 align:start position:0%
is to leverage online training uh
 
04:30:26.510 --> 04:30:26.520 align:start position:0%
leveraging online training will be able
 
04:30:30.649 --> 04:30:30.659 align:start position:0%
to spread our resources uh in a way
 
04:30:34.070 --> 04:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
where we can reach more officers and
 
04:30:36.469 --> 04:30:36.479 align:start position:0%
also reduce the costs associated with
 
04:30:38.469 --> 04:30:38.479 align:start position:0%
overtime and backfill
 
04:30:41.689 --> 04:30:41.699 align:start position:0%
versus sending people to a face-to-face
 
04:30:43.550 --> 04:30:43.560 align:start position:0%
class there are some classes that they
 
04:30:46.849 --> 04:30:46.859 align:start position:0%
do need to be face to face it is what it
 
04:30:49.490 --> 04:30:49.500 align:start position:0%
is we tried uh
 
04:30:51.649 --> 04:30:51.659 align:start position:0%
doing some pistol qualifications online
 
04:30:54.010 --> 04:30:54.020 align:start position:0%
it didn't go no that's not sure
 
04:30:56.689 --> 04:30:56.699 align:start position:0%
uh but so you know certainly we we do
 
04:30:59.149 --> 04:30:59.159 align:start position:0%
have to um have some face-to-face
 
04:31:01.670 --> 04:31:01.680 align:start position:0%
classes uh but we really do need to
 
04:31:05.510 --> 04:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
leverage our online learning uh system
 
04:31:07.550 --> 04:31:07.560 align:start position:0%
and we do have a online learning system
 
04:31:10.670 --> 04:31:10.680 align:start position:0%
in place uh we just have to build
 
04:31:12.849 --> 04:31:12.859 align:start position:0%
content and building content online
 
04:31:16.250 --> 04:31:16.260 align:start position:0%
about an hour of content about 100 hours
 
04:31:19.309 --> 04:31:19.319 align:start position:0%
worth of behind the scene work uh to do
 
04:31:22.250 --> 04:31:22.260 align:start position:0%
it correctly right so uh but thank you
 
04:31:25.149 --> 04:31:25.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:27.710 --> 04:31:27.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I just wanted an
 
04:31:30.110 --> 04:31:30.120 align:start position:0%
observation at one point the state
 
04:31:32.809 --> 04:31:32.819 align:start position:0%
police came in and gave us a map showing
 
04:31:34.910 --> 04:31:34.920 align:start position:0%
all the towns that they are responsible
 
04:31:37.849 --> 04:31:37.859 align:start position:0%
for because they have less than
 
04:31:41.689 --> 04:31:41.699 align:start position:0%
1200 or 13 some number of population
 
04:31:43.849 --> 04:31:43.859 align:start position:0%
still many of these will have a police
 
04:31:43.859 --> 04:31:45.050 align:start position:0%
still many of these will have a police
chief

04:31:45.050 --> 04:31:45.060 align:start position:0%
chief
 
04:31:47.929 --> 04:31:47.939 align:start position:0%
who's there 30 40 hours a week rest the
 
04:31:49.130 --> 04:31:49.140 align:start position:0%
time the state police have the
 
04:31:51.170 --> 04:31:51.180 align:start position:0%
responsibility for that town so when
 
04:31:53.809 --> 04:31:53.819 align:start position:0%
they have this one person many times it
 
04:31:56.389 --> 04:31:56.399 align:start position:0%
is not a certain certificated person
 
04:31:59.030 --> 04:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
which is why this law was passed because
 
04:32:01.250 --> 04:32:01.260 align:start position:0%
okay it's your turn you're the chief
 
04:32:03.769 --> 04:32:03.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:05.750 --> 04:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
some of these things you never know in a
 
04:32:07.910 --> 04:32:07.920 align:start position:0%
small town so that's I think what
 
04:32:10.189 --> 04:32:10.199 align:start position:0%
they're getting at rather than saying
 
04:32:11.710 --> 04:32:11.720 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of
 
04:32:14.090 --> 04:32:14.100 align:start position:0%
non-qualified police Chiefs around this
 
04:32:16.670 --> 04:32:16.680 align:start position:0%
or policemen around it's just this this
 
04:32:19.010 --> 04:32:19.020 align:start position:0%
small town and I remember one near me
 
04:32:21.170 --> 04:32:21.180 align:start position:0%
that you know they were kind of contract
 
04:32:23.210 --> 04:32:23.220 align:start position:0%
him with the sheriff or
 
04:32:25.309 --> 04:32:25.319 align:start position:0%
was It was kind of in the corner of the
 
04:32:26.929 --> 04:32:26.939 align:start position:0%
State Police didn't have more trouble
 
04:32:29.929 --> 04:32:29.939 align:start position:0%
getting there so it is a surprise
 
04:32:32.929 --> 04:32:32.939 align:start position:0%
in some places one time around me in
 
04:32:34.809 --> 04:32:34.819 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County there were three
 
04:32:38.389 --> 04:32:38.399 align:start position:0%
retired policemen who were Chiefs
 
04:32:41.210 --> 04:32:41.220 align:start position:0%
so they got 30 hours a week but one of
 
04:32:42.889 --> 04:32:42.899 align:start position:0%
them told me he said me and two other
 
04:32:44.330 --> 04:32:44.340 align:start position:0%
officers saved the town a hundred
 
04:32:47.030 --> 04:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars because we're working
 
04:32:49.010 --> 04:32:49.020 align:start position:0%
part-time and not and the town doesn't
 
04:32:50.929 --> 04:32:50.939 align:start position:0%
have to make that 20-some percent
 
04:32:53.630 --> 04:32:53.640 align:start position:0%
contribution to the retirement system so
 
04:32:55.550 --> 04:32:55.560 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of things going on that we
 
04:32:57.349 --> 04:32:57.359 align:start position:0%
may not be familiar with but at least
 
04:32:59.929 --> 04:32:59.939 align:start position:0%
we're usually getting a 20 plus year
 
04:33:01.910 --> 04:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
experienced guy that's running a
 
04:33:07.689 --> 04:33:07.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:11.090 --> 04:33:11.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I'm looking at um
 
04:33:13.310 --> 04:33:13.320 align:start position:0%
two of your admin of your organizational
 
04:33:15.410 --> 04:33:15.420 align:start position:0%
units the administration and standards
 
04:33:17.510 --> 04:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
and also the law enforcement training in
 
04:33:20.330 --> 04:33:20.340 align:start position:0%
the line 50 personal service temporary
 
04:33:20.340 --> 04:33:22.250 align:start position:0%
the line 50 personal service temporary
appointed

04:33:22.250 --> 04:33:22.260 align:start position:0%
appointed
 
04:33:24.890 --> 04:33:24.900 align:start position:0%
both of them have quite a big bump
 
04:33:27.289 --> 04:33:27.299 align:start position:0%
between 22 and 23
 
04:33:30.051 --> 04:33:30.061 align:start position:0%
and the first one also continues to
 
04:33:33.590 --> 04:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
increase in 24 and 25. any um you know
 
04:33:35.689 --> 04:33:35.699 align:start position:0%
color on what's going on there I mean
 
04:33:38.330 --> 04:33:38.340 align:start position:0%
you know 22 to 23 is one thing and then
 
04:33:40.789 --> 04:33:40.799 align:start position:0%
one of them grows more from 23 through
 
04:33:42.830 --> 04:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
the 24 25.
 
04:33:45.230 --> 04:33:45.240 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question sir could
 
04:33:47.209 --> 04:33:47.219 align:start position:0%
I ask just uh
 
04:33:50.330 --> 04:33:50.340 align:start position:0%
what page are you referring to on the
 
04:33:54.769 --> 04:33:54.779 align:start position:0%
state budget yes page 1213 yes and then
 
04:33:56.689 --> 04:33:56.699 align:start position:0%
also page 12
 
04:33:59.769 --> 04:33:59.779 align:start position:0%
14 but let's just focus on the 12 13
 
04:34:03.289 --> 04:34:03.299 align:start position:0%
about middle of the page line 50 050
 
04:34:06.410 --> 04:34:06.420 align:start position:0%
personal service stamp appointed the
 
04:34:12.830 --> 04:34:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:16.250 --> 04:34:16.260 align:start position:0%
oh sorry my bad I marked the wrong line
 
04:34:20.570 --> 04:34:20.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:22.189 --> 04:34:22.199 align:start position:0%
that's why you need to use a piece of
 
04:34:24.890 --> 04:34:24.900 align:start position:0%
paper I'll get a ruler you and I both
 
04:34:24.900 --> 04:34:26.869 align:start position:0%
paper I'll get a ruler you and I both
sir

04:34:26.869 --> 04:34:26.879 align:start position:0%
sir
 
04:34:31.670 --> 04:34:31.680 align:start position:0%
um the uh it's going from 204 to 332 and
 
04:34:36.349 --> 04:34:36.359 align:start position:0%
then 382 and 402. yes uh I I cannot
 
04:34:39.230 --> 04:34:39.240 align:start position:0%
speak directly to why those increases
 
04:34:41.869 --> 04:34:41.879 align:start position:0%
happen uh those
 
04:34:44.631 --> 04:34:44.641 align:start position:0%
um benefits oh I'm sorry I'm going to
 
04:34:49.070 --> 04:34:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:50.929 --> 04:34:50.939 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Max Schultz
 
04:34:52.490 --> 04:34:52.500 align:start position:0%
I'm a major with police standard
 
04:34:56.449 --> 04:34:56.459 align:start position:0%
training so the the uh prioritized needs
 
04:34:58.730 --> 04:34:58.740 align:start position:0%
budget added two additional full-time
 
04:35:01.970 --> 04:35:01.980 align:start position:0%
positions and that would be under this
 
04:35:04.131 --> 04:35:04.141 align:start position:0%
8980 Administration and standards
 
04:35:05.810 --> 04:35:05.820 align:start position:0%
account I believe that's why you're
 
04:35:08.150 --> 04:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
seeing an increase in I got it and to be
 
04:35:10.670 --> 04:35:10.680 align:start position:0%
fairy already whispered that to me so I
 
04:35:16.429 --> 04:35:16.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:19.070 --> 04:35:19.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair that reminds me
 
04:35:20.209 --> 04:35:20.219 align:start position:0%
um in your
 
04:35:23.631 --> 04:35:23.641 align:start position:0%
request to the governor for your budget
 
04:35:27.410 --> 04:35:27.420 align:start position:0%
what didn't you get that you asked for
 
04:35:30.590 --> 04:35:30.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question uh the the
 
04:35:32.810 --> 04:35:32.820 align:start position:0%
governor was very supportive of the two
 
04:35:35.150 --> 04:35:35.160 align:start position:0%
uh prioritized needs that we put forth
 
04:35:39.289 --> 04:35:39.299 align:start position:0%
and and uh his office uh supported both
 
04:35:41.810 --> 04:35:41.820 align:start position:0%
of those requests
 
04:35:41.820 --> 04:35:43.310 align:start position:0%
of those requests
I

04:35:43.310 --> 04:35:43.320 align:start position:0%
I
 
04:35:46.551 --> 04:35:46.561 align:start position:0%
we again I I would have asked for that
 
04:35:50.150 --> 04:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
other 75 000 per budget year
 
04:35:52.849 --> 04:35:52.859 align:start position:0%
but uh working with the accreditation
 
04:35:56.390 --> 04:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
commission and trying to work with doj
 
04:35:58.490 --> 04:35:58.500 align:start position:0%
and the Federal Grant
 
04:36:00.949 --> 04:36:00.959 align:start position:0%
by the time we realized that we're
 
04:36:02.631 --> 04:36:02.641 align:start position:0%
probably just going to need that seed
 
04:36:05.209 --> 04:36:05.219 align:start position:0%
money uh it was this had already been
 
04:36:05.219 --> 04:36:10.131 align:start position:0%
money uh it was this had already been
submitted

04:36:10.131 --> 04:36:10.141 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:18.289 --> 04:36:18.299 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:20.869 --> 04:36:20.879 align:start position:0%
just to clarify so I did hand out the
 
04:36:23.390 --> 04:36:23.400 align:start position:0%
fiscal item that uh is actually on the
 
04:36:24.949 --> 04:36:24.959 align:start position:0%
agenda for tomorrow's fiscal so this is
 
04:36:26.570 --> 04:36:26.580 align:start position:0%
an accept and expend for the police
 
04:36:28.609 --> 04:36:28.619 align:start position:0%
standards and training Council for
 
04:36:33.051 --> 04:36:33.061 align:start position:0%
fiscal 23 of 75 000 of uh pass-through
 
04:36:34.910 --> 04:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
grant money through the Department of
 
04:36:34.920 --> 04:36:35.990 align:start position:0%

what uh director skip is referring to is
 
04:36:40.250 --> 04:36:40.260 align:start position:0%
needing a continuation of this program
 
04:36:43.131 --> 04:36:43.141 align:start position:0%
for fiscal 24 and 25 and I think we
 
04:36:45.051 --> 04:36:45.061 align:start position:0%
would just want to clarify if there's an
 
04:36:46.551 --> 04:36:46.561 align:start position:0%
expectation that Grant funds would be
 
04:36:48.051 --> 04:36:48.061 align:start position:0%
available or if you would be asking for
 
04:36:49.670 --> 04:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
General funds during the the next two
 
04:36:51.109 --> 04:36:51.119 align:start position:0%
years just to make sure that that's
 
04:36:51.119 --> 04:36:52.670 align:start position:0%
years just to make sure that that's
clear

04:36:52.670 --> 04:36:52.680 align:start position:0%
clear
 
04:36:54.949 --> 04:36:54.959 align:start position:0%
uh thank you sir to allow for
 
04:36:57.349 --> 04:36:57.359 align:start position:0%
clarification that would be
 
04:36:59.631 --> 04:36:59.641 align:start position:0%
um we are going to seek
 
04:37:02.810 --> 04:37:02.820 align:start position:0%
any kind of grant funding that we we can
 
04:37:07.551 --> 04:37:07.561 align:start position:0%
but uh we would be asking for uh general
 
04:37:12.170 --> 04:37:12.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:12.180 --> 04:37:26.570 align:start position:0%

might as well go back in the service and
 
04:38:50.269 --> 04:38:50.279 align:start position:0%
that's what I did but my partner uh I
 
04:38:51.769 --> 04:38:51.779 align:start position:0%
actually I wanted to trust the trust
 
04:38:53.631 --> 04:38:53.641 align:start position:0%
funds in the town now okay in fact we
 
04:38:55.609 --> 04:38:55.619 align:start position:0%

know that the relationship
 
04:39:06.590 --> 04:39:06.600 align:start position:0%
but then I'm getting that old it was it
 
04:39:08.689 --> 04:39:08.699 align:start position:0%
must have been after June because I I
 
04:39:10.670 --> 04:39:10.680 align:start position:0%
wasn't aware that uh police standing in
 
04:39:12.949 --> 04:39:12.959 align:start position:0%
training was must have been be informed
 
04:39:15.170 --> 04:39:15.180 align:start position:0%
at that time you're exactly correct we
 
04:39:18.170 --> 04:39:18.180 align:start position:0%
were we were uh constituted in 1971
 
04:39:21.769 --> 04:39:21.779 align:start position:0%
through Governor's order and um
 
04:39:24.769 --> 04:39:24.779 align:start position:0%

04:39:27.349 --> 04:39:27.359 align:start position:0%
well 51st birthday right
 
04:39:30.949 --> 04:39:30.959 align:start position:0%
I that I do not know but um I I know
 
04:39:32.570 --> 04:39:32.580 align:start position:0%
exactly where the documents are that
 
04:39:35.510 --> 04:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll answer that and I'm I will
 
04:39:40.250 --> 04:39:40.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:43.430 --> 04:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:45.708 --> 04:39:45.718 align:start position:0%
so I am the sixth
 
04:39:48.110 --> 04:39:48.120 align:start position:0%
yeah I am the sixth
 
04:39:51.890 --> 04:39:51.900 align:start position:0%
there's let's hope right
 
04:39:51.900 --> 04:39:54.350 align:start position:0%
there's let's hope right
hahaha

04:39:54.350 --> 04:39:54.360 align:start position:0%
hahaha
 
04:39:57.288 --> 04:39:57.298 align:start position:0%
I just I just wanted to add that uh my
 
04:39:59.448 --> 04:39:59.458 align:start position:0%
training was go out and use common sense
 
04:40:02.330 --> 04:40:02.340 align:start position:0%
that was it and that was it was good
 
04:40:03.830 --> 04:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
advice matter of fact Carl Worcester you
 
04:40:05.690 --> 04:40:05.700 align:start position:0%
might have heard well he was the chief
 
04:40:07.670 --> 04:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
at the time and uh you know that was it
 
04:40:09.170 --> 04:40:09.180 align:start position:0%
was interesting
 
04:40:13.010 --> 04:40:13.020 align:start position:0%
but but we and and to cover what uh
 
04:40:15.288 --> 04:40:15.298 align:start position:0%
State Police they were very very helpful
 
04:40:18.110 --> 04:40:18.120 align:start position:0%
in uh you know because you got training
 
04:40:20.090 --> 04:40:20.100 align:start position:0%
from listening to them and even though
 
04:40:22.010 --> 04:40:22.020 align:start position:0%
he was a rookie Ronnie Callaway I'm sure
 
04:40:24.410 --> 04:40:24.420 align:start position:0%
you've heard of him yep uh there was a
 
04:40:26.570 --> 04:40:26.580 align:start position:0%
great uh it was it was a great
 
04:40:29.208 --> 04:40:29.218 align:start position:0%
experience it was a thankless experience
 
04:40:31.010 --> 04:40:31.020 align:start position:0%
but it was a great experience yes well
 
04:40:32.510 --> 04:40:32.520 align:start position:0%
it's always good when the boss gives you
 
04:40:34.788 --> 04:40:34.798 align:start position:0%
a gun and a badge and and it throws you
 
04:40:36.830 --> 04:40:36.840 align:start position:0%
the keys and says hey don't cause any
 
04:40:38.810 --> 04:40:38.820 align:start position:0%
problems out there that was my
 
04:40:40.670 --> 04:40:40.680 align:start position:0%
introduction she didn't give me a gun he
 
04:40:42.530 --> 04:40:42.540 align:start position:0%
gave me the badge I think I still have
 
04:40:43.690 --> 04:40:43.700 align:start position:0%
it somewhere
 
04:40:46.010 --> 04:40:46.020 align:start position:0%
he wanted it back but I didn't give it
 
04:40:49.670 --> 04:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
back good for you you deserve it
 
04:40:51.708 --> 04:40:51.718 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for coming thank you so
 
04:40:51.718 --> 04:42:08.750 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for coming thank you so
much

04:42:08.750 --> 04:42:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:08.760 --> 04:42:23.708 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:42:23.708 --> 04:42:23.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:26.030 --> 04:42:26.040 align:start position:0%
we've said this before the the heavy
 
04:42:28.190 --> 04:42:28.200 align:start position:0%
workload for this division will be a
 
04:42:30.230 --> 04:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
highway you know education
 
04:42:32.570 --> 04:42:32.580 align:start position:0%
Transportation so these smaller agencies
 
04:42:34.670 --> 04:42:34.680 align:start position:0%
are the simpler budgets if you complete
 
04:42:35.930 --> 04:42:35.940 align:start position:0%
them now it's just less to worry about
 
04:42:35.940 --> 04:42:37.670 align:start position:0%
them now it's just less to worry about
later

04:42:37.670 --> 04:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
later
 
04:42:39.890 --> 04:42:39.900 align:start position:0%
I would hold off on lottery only because
 
04:42:40.970 --> 04:42:40.980 align:start position:0%
he's going to come back with that
 
04:42:42.890 --> 04:42:42.900 align:start position:0%
million dollar request so we just need
 
04:42:44.628 --> 04:42:44.638 align:start position:0%
to wait for that but once once that does
 
04:42:46.310 --> 04:42:46.320 align:start position:0%
come through
 
04:42:48.170 --> 04:42:48.180 align:start position:0%
um we'll add a future work session you
 
04:42:50.570 --> 04:42:50.580 align:start position:0%
could do that for sure
