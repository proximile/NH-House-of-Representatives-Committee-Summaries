00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
uh on that from the amendment now
 
00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
now to why
 
00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
first of all i think we i will open it
 
00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:26.720 align:start position:0%
to discussion
 
00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
uh uh you can
 
00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:32.400 align:start position:0%

discuss
 
00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:36.160 align:start position:0%
the amendment uh i think we will discuss
 
00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:37.120 align:start position:0%
both the amendment
 
00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
and the bill at once i would i would
 
00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:47.360 align:start position:0%
if there's uh just uh
 
00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:50.480 align:start position:0%
won't take any vote until uh you know
 
00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:53.200 align:start position:0%
until we are ready but uh are there any
 
00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:53.830 align:start position:0%
until we are ready but uh are there any
comments

00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
comments
 
00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
uh on the amendment and any comments on
 
00:19:58.470 --> 00:19:58.480 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
just to clarify this amendment 1573.
 
00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
any comments on the bill any comments on
 
00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
my concern is um uh section
 
00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
three uh regarding the um
 
00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
zoonotic um transmission
 
00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:44.720 align:start position:0%
um and the um
 
00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
i feel i feel with this one when i look
 
00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
at it
 
00:20:49.669 --> 00:20:49.679 align:start position:0%
and i spoke to a lot of different people
 
00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:51.440 align:start position:0%
about it and um
 
00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:54.880 align:start position:0%
came down to talking to actual members
 
00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
of the fish and game
 
00:20:58.549 --> 00:20:58.559 align:start position:0%
um that go out there and do the work and
 
00:21:00.149 --> 00:21:00.159 align:start position:0%
they felt that it was
 
00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
logistically difficult not enforceable
 
00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
and they said how are they going to
 
00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
monitor this wildlife
 
00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
looking for it i mean um and
 
00:21:15.029 --> 00:21:15.039 align:start position:0%
they said um they felt that
 
00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
this was a way to create
 
00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
health certificates for every animal
 
00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:22.480 align:start position:0%
coming into this state
 
00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
and the problem with that again is
 
00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:26.070 align:start position:0%
and the problem with that again is
enforcement

00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
and tracking it down and manpower issues
 
00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
and financials um i do feel it's an
 
00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
overreach of the government we're adding
 
00:21:39.909 --> 00:21:39.919 align:start position:0%
more um fees and
 
00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
punitive punitive damages to
 
00:21:46.149 --> 00:21:46.159 align:start position:0%
folks too and it is a broad
 
00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
reach in the fact that um
 
00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
there is nothing that's happening right
 
00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
now this is not addressing something
 
00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
that is currently a problem this is
 
00:21:58.630 --> 00:21:58.640 align:start position:0%
addressing a problem for the future
 
00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:00.880 align:start position:0%
and i realize they want to put things in
 
00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:02.480 align:start position:0%
place but
 
00:22:04.789 --> 00:22:04.799 align:start position:0%
right in the section that we have of
 
00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:06.320 align:start position:0%
part three it does
 
00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:10.640 align:start position:0%
say that they refer to the governor if
 
00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
um executive order is deemed necessary
 
00:22:15.909 --> 00:22:15.919 align:start position:0%
and if he can do that anyway i see no
 
00:22:17.029 --> 00:22:17.039 align:start position:0%
point in
 
00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
us doing this prematurely until the
 
00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
logistics are worked out
 
00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:25.280 align:start position:0%
for making this program to be workable
 
00:22:27.029 --> 00:22:27.039 align:start position:0%
operable by the people that are on the
 
00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
ground doing the work
 
00:22:32.149 --> 00:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
and um i feel if they don't see a need
 
00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:34.720 align:start position:0%
for it i don't know why we should
 
00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
keep that do understand the limitations
 
00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:38.390 align:start position:0%
keep that do understand the limitations
of

00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
you know uh we cannot pull this out
 
00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
of the bill um and so i find that a
 
00:22:46.149 --> 00:22:46.159 align:start position:0%
little frustrating i don't know if we
 
00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
can still do
 
00:22:50.789 --> 00:22:50.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:54.320 align:start position:0%
make some changes to that so that we can
 
00:22:56.149 --> 00:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
i can vote for the rest of the bill
 
00:22:58.390 --> 00:22:58.400 align:start position:0%
because i do feel the rest of the bill
 
00:22:58.400 --> 00:22:58.950 align:start position:0%
because i do feel the rest of the bill
is

00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:02.400 align:start position:0%
worth passing um so that's my comments
 
00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:06.480 align:start position:0%
thank you now you realize that
 
00:23:10.549 --> 00:23:10.559 align:start position:0%
fish and game testified in favor of it
 
00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:14.320 align:start position:0%
right and the fish and game
 
00:23:17.909 --> 00:23:17.919 align:start position:0%
committee uh
 
00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
was unanimously in favor of it
 
00:23:27.909 --> 00:23:27.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative smith
 
00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:36.400 align:start position:0%
um actually uh thank you mr chair
 
00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
for taking my question and a comment
 
00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
also the who
 
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
has called for a ban of the sale of live
 
00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:48.320 align:start position:0%
wild mammals in food markets to prevent
 
00:23:50.549 --> 00:23:50.559 align:start position:0%
the emergence of new diseases
 
00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:52.240 align:start position:0%
so if that's something that's going to
 
00:23:53.530 --> 00:23:53.540 align:start position:0%
be happening um
 
00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:54.710 align:start position:0%
be happening um
[Music]

00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:23:56.789 --> 00:23:56.799 align:start position:0%
being recommended worldwide to prevent
 
00:23:58.310 --> 00:23:58.320 align:start position:0%
the spread of diseases
 
00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
like you know salmonella
 
00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
cobalt whatever i mean just all
 
00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
different kinds of things it seems like
 
00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:06.480 align:start position:0%
we would just be kind of
 
00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
setting up a program for that to happen
 
00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:10.720 align:start position:0%
and as far as the governor's
 
00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
um executive powers
 
00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
um in dur as we've seen in the last year
 
00:24:18.549 --> 00:24:18.559 align:start position:0%
a lot of people have said the
 
00:24:20.789 --> 00:24:20.799 align:start position:0%
legislature should have some say
 
00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
in what goes into executive orders and
 
00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:24.470 align:start position:0%
in what goes into executive orders and
this

00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:26.400 align:start position:0%
would actually put that in statute so
 
00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:28.640 align:start position:0%
the legislature would have had
 
00:24:33.029 --> 00:24:33.039 align:start position:0%
a say in it but my original uh comment
 
00:24:36.390 --> 00:24:36.400 align:start position:0%
was um about the uh
 
00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:39.520 align:start position:0%
the other fishing game part with the
 
00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:42.880 align:start position:0%
um the
 
00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
fish derelict fishing gear and um
 
00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:45.990 align:start position:0%
fish derelict fishing gear and um
changing

00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
changing
 
00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
the name of the fund to leave out the
 
00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:51.200 align:start position:0%
words fishing for energy was
 
00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:53.440 align:start position:0%
the uh when i spoke with the prime
 
00:24:54.789 --> 00:24:54.799 align:start position:0%
sponsor about this
 
00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:56.640 align:start position:0%
he was very much in favor of that he
 
00:24:59.190 --> 00:24:59.200 align:start position:0%
said it made it a much clearer thing
 
00:25:01.909 --> 00:25:01.919 align:start position:0%
and the other part of the amendment that
 
00:25:01.919 --> 00:25:03.510 align:start position:0%
and the other part of the amendment that
the

00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:06.640 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor introduced was taking
 
00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
shrimp out of the equation and that is
 
00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:09.990 align:start position:0%
shrimp out of the equation and that is
because

00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
the shrimp fishery
 
00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
in the new england is pretty well shut
 
00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:16.630 align:start position:0%
in the new england is pretty well shut
down

00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:16.640 align:start position:0%
down
 
00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:18.880 align:start position:0%
and the facilities for even processing
 
00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
shrimp have been shut down
 
00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:22.640 align:start position:0%
because there is because there are no
 
00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:25.120 align:start position:0%
shrimp so that was the reason for that
 
00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:25.909 align:start position:0%
shrimp so that was the reason for that
being

00:25:25.909 --> 00:25:25.919 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
removed from the bill in case anyone
 
00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:28.950 align:start position:0%
removed from the bill in case anyone
wondered

00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
wondered
 
00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:35.669 --> 00:25:35.679 align:start position:0%
any anyone else just to speak on
 
00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
me sir
 
00:25:42.630 --> 00:25:42.640 align:start position:0%
thank you so just back to the zoonotic
 
00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
uh portion of the book uh
 
00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
in my mind a couple of things first
 
00:25:53.029 --> 00:25:53.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:56.470 --> 00:25:56.480 align:start position:0%
if if we know that that uh
 
00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
these diseases are prevalent based on
 
00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.750 align:start position:0%
these diseases are prevalent based on
who

00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
who
 
00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:05.440 align:start position:0%
and uh and that the uh fish and game has
 
00:26:07.669 --> 00:26:07.679 align:start position:0%
come to us and said hey we need to
 
00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:09.440 align:start position:0%
do this and then testify that we
 
00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
shouldn't do it and that they have the
 
00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:12.470 align:start position:0%
shouldn't do it and that they have the
resources

00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
resources
 
00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
to do it um
 
00:26:17.269 --> 00:26:17.279 align:start position:0%
i don't know that i would want to be on
 
00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:18.880 align:start position:0%
the side answering to the
 
00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
to my constituents saying i could have
 
00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:22.240 align:start position:0%
done something
 
00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:25.360 align:start position:0%
but i failed to do it and if if
 
00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:26.230 align:start position:0%
but i failed to do it and if if
something

00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:26.240 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:28.640 align:start position:0%
did happen and we had the power to
 
00:26:29.909 --> 00:26:29.919 align:start position:0%
prevent it
 
00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
uh via the language of this bill i think
 
00:26:33.909 --> 00:26:33.919 align:start position:0%
that that's our
 
00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
responsibility to do that i don't think
 
00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
there's overreach
 
00:26:41.269 --> 00:26:41.279 align:start position:0%
um this is the official game doing what
 
00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
they say
 
00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
is their job to do we're giving them the
 
00:26:46.870 --> 00:26:46.880 align:start position:0%
legal background to do that
 
00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
and uh if there was a cost to it i think
 
00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:54.549 --> 00:26:54.559 align:start position:0%
and so i think we're just giving them
 
00:26:56.950 --> 00:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
the authority to act reasonably
 
00:26:58.549 --> 00:26:58.559 align:start position:0%
as representative smith said in
 
00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:06.390 --> 00:27:06.400 align:start position:0%
i think any other any other questions uh
 
00:27:08.549 --> 00:27:08.559 align:start position:0%
or any questions or comments on this
 
00:27:08.559 --> 00:27:14.470 align:start position:0%
or any questions or comments on this
issue

00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:16.720 align:start position:0%
sir i see no questions all right uh i
 
00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:18.880 align:start position:0%
just uh called your attention uh
 
00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:22.480 align:start position:0%
the uh testimony from the fish and game
 
00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:24.149 align:start position:0%
the uh testimony from the fish and game
department

00:27:24.149 --> 00:27:24.159 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
uh where and it was uh
 
00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:30.320 align:start position:0%
paul sanderson the legal coordinator who
 
00:27:32.149 --> 00:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
testified in favor
 
00:27:34.789 --> 00:27:34.799 align:start position:0%
and one of the things he did say in his
 
00:27:35.909 --> 00:27:35.919 align:start position:0%
testimony was
 
00:27:37.909 --> 00:27:37.919 align:start position:0%
uh we have worked closely on section
 
00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
three which is uh
 
00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:42.640 align:start position:0%
the element we're talking about uh with
 
00:27:44.470 --> 00:27:44.480 align:start position:0%
senator waters and the department of
 
00:27:46.710 --> 00:27:46.720 align:start position:0%
agriculture to deal with concerns over
 
00:27:48.310 --> 00:27:48.320 align:start position:0%
the potential spread
 
00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:50.960 align:start position:0%
of zoonotic diseases within the state of
 
00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:52.240 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:54.640 align:start position:0%
and acknowledged that the covet 19
 
00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:55.990 align:start position:0%
and acknowledged that the covet 19
pandemic

00:27:55.990 --> 00:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
00:27:57.669 --> 00:27:57.679 align:start position:0%
has brought this concern to the
 
00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
forefront in the state and across the
 
00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:01.430 align:start position:0%
forefront in the state and across the
world

00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
world
 
00:28:04.149 --> 00:28:04.159 align:start position:0%
as such an expression of concern for the
 
00:28:04.159 --> 00:28:04.549 align:start position:0%
as such an expression of concern for the
issue

00:28:04.549 --> 00:28:04.559 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
is warranted in the statutes existing
 
00:28:10.149 --> 00:28:10.159 align:start position:0%
processes for our two departments
 
00:28:11.909 --> 00:28:11.919 align:start position:0%
as well as the department of health and
 
00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
human services
 
00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:16.240 align:start position:0%
are in place to carefully watch for the
 
00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:18.480 align:start position:0%
emergence of any issues and to seek
 
00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:19.430 align:start position:0%
emergence of any issues and to seek
assistance

00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
assistance
 
00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
from the legislature and the governor
 
00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
in addition the requirements of fish and
 
00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:28.840 align:start position:0%
game law
 
00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:34.149 align:start position:0%
game law
uh

00:28:34.149 --> 00:28:34.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:36.549 --> 00:28:36.559 align:start position:0%
rsa sets forth a workable process to
 
00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:38.240 align:start position:0%
respond to challenges when
 
00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:40.240 align:start position:0%
and if they are identified and we
 
00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
support the proposal
 
00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:50.389 --> 00:28:50.399 align:start position:0%
did testify in favor uh
 
00:28:54.149 --> 00:28:54.159 align:start position:0%
i think personally i think uh
 
00:28:58.230 --> 00:28:58.240 align:start position:0%
the the way
 
00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
you know the way that this government
 
00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:02.240 align:start position:0%
operates is
 
00:29:05.269 --> 00:29:05.279 align:start position:0%
uh the executive branch is very
 
00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:08.240 align:start position:0%
relatively limited in what it can do
 
00:29:10.389 --> 00:29:10.399 align:start position:0%
without funding
 
00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
uh most uh we as the
 
00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:18.320 align:start position:0%
the we are we basically represent the
 
00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:19.190 align:start position:0%
the we are we basically represent the
people

00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:22.960 align:start position:0%
the legislature and
 
00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:26.080 align:start position:0%
we provide
 
00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:30.240 align:start position:0%
the funding and uh in order for
 
00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:33.360 align:start position:0%
the executive branch to operate and part
 
00:29:34.389 --> 00:29:34.399 align:start position:0%
of that
 
00:29:37.669 --> 00:29:37.679 align:start position:0%
uh responsibility of the of that is that
 
00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:40.960 align:start position:0%
we we tell them what are
 
00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:44.480 align:start position:0%
what the what the priorities are
 
00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:47.120 align:start position:0%
or should be it doesn't stop them from
 
00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:48.389 align:start position:0%
or should be it doesn't stop them from
reacting

00:29:48.389 --> 00:29:48.399 align:start position:0%
reacting
 
00:29:51.909 --> 00:29:51.919 align:start position:0%
but it but they do need to be able to
 
00:29:53.590 --> 00:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
have plans in place
 
00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
they do uh they do need to
 
00:30:00.389 --> 00:30:00.399 align:start position:0%
uh be they are expected
 
00:30:02.149 --> 00:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
i think the gov the government is
 
00:30:04.389 --> 00:30:04.399 align:start position:0%
expected to think ahead
 
00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
to think uh don't not not to
 
00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:10.480 align:start position:0%
wait for the problem to show up but to
 
00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:12.480 align:start position:0%
anticipate the problem
 
00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
that doesn't always work but you know
 
00:30:19.029 --> 00:30:19.039 align:start position:0%
they they do ex they're paying
 
00:30:22.149 --> 00:30:22.159 align:start position:0%
us and they're paying the
 
00:30:26.549 --> 00:30:26.559 align:start position:0%
the people are paying uh the legislature
 
00:30:29.269 --> 00:30:29.279 align:start position:0%
not much but they're paying us uh and
 
00:30:29.279 --> 00:30:30.070 align:start position:0%
not much but they're paying us uh and
the

00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
but also the the executive branch to
 
00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:34.840 align:start position:0%
look forward to look
 
00:30:38.389 --> 00:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
at uh and to plan ahead to plan for
 
00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
the uh what can happen and
 
00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:44.480 align:start position:0%
to be the last thing you want to do to
 
00:30:45.269 --> 00:30:45.279 align:start position:0%
do is to
 
00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:49.120 align:start position:0%
just you have to is to have a
 
00:30:50.549 --> 00:30:50.559 align:start position:0%
something happen and you weren't
 
00:30:53.029 --> 00:30:53.039 align:start position:0%
thinking that you didn't you didn't plan
 
00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:54.320 align:start position:0%
for it
 
00:30:57.909 --> 00:30:57.919 align:start position:0%
you know and you know you
 
00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:01.360 align:start position:0%
when when the when the when an attack
 
00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:02.389 align:start position:0%
when when the when the when an attack
comes

00:31:02.389 --> 00:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
comes
 
00:31:04.950 --> 00:31:04.960 align:start position:0%
but this and that could be a disease you
 
00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:05.840 align:start position:0%
fight the battle
 
00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
what you got with who's who's there what
 
00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
you what plans you have
 
00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:12.240 align:start position:0%
and if you don't have any plans then
 
00:31:13.669 --> 00:31:13.679 align:start position:0%
you're running then you're really in
 
00:31:13.679 --> 00:31:15.269 align:start position:0%
you're running then you're really in
trouble

00:31:15.269 --> 00:31:15.279 align:start position:0%
trouble
 
00:31:18.630 --> 00:31:18.640 align:start position:0%
that's that's just my
 
00:31:21.909 --> 00:31:21.919 align:start position:0%
my feeling uh any uh
 
00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um in reference to your
 
00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:26.470 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um in reference to your
comments

00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:26.480 align:start position:0%
comments
 
00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
can i ask generally when there's a bill
 
00:31:32.149 --> 00:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
like this
 
00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:35.360 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't there be more specifics in
 
00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:35.750 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't there be more specifics in
how

00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
how
 
00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:38.320 align:start position:0%
it would be carried out this is the
 
00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
generalities that i'm really having
 
00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:43.200 align:start position:0%
problems with and when i talk to other
 
00:31:44.149 --> 00:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
people they
 
00:31:47.269 --> 00:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
also express concern for that
 
00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:50.080 align:start position:0%
so is that is that normal for it not to
 
00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
really have
 
00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
any specifics at all it was extremely
 
00:31:57.029 --> 00:31:57.039 align:start position:0%
general and broad
 
00:31:59.750 --> 00:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
that that is always an issue with
 
00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:01.350 align:start position:0%
that that is always an issue with
legislation

00:32:01.350 --> 00:32:01.360 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:05.440 align:start position:0%
you you don't want to micromanage
 
00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:08.480 align:start position:0%
but you want to make reasonable you like
 
00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:08.870 align:start position:0%
but you want to make reasonable you like
you

00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:10.960 align:start position:0%
you'd like to make reasonable direction
 
00:32:11.909 --> 00:32:11.919 align:start position:0%
and that always
 
00:32:16.710 --> 00:32:16.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
of legislation uh
 
00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
sometime it works sometimes it doesn't
 
00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:23.440 align:start position:0%
sometimes you don't really know
 
00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:27.360 align:start position:0%
generally you we do have a rule system
 
00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
so you don't want to go so far into the
 
00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
in place place things that should be
 
00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:34.480 align:start position:0%
done in rules
 
00:32:37.269 --> 00:32:37.279 align:start position:0%
let the rules generated by the
 
00:32:37.279 --> 00:32:38.389 align:start position:0%
let the rules generated by the
administration

00:32:38.389 --> 00:32:38.399 align:start position:0%
administration
 
00:32:40.149 --> 00:32:40.159 align:start position:0%
so you don't want to get too deep into
 
00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
that but there are times when you might
 
00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:43.440 align:start position:0%
have to
 
00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
but that that is it's on a case-by-case
 
00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
basis in this state
 
00:32:51.269 --> 00:32:51.279 align:start position:0%
in this instance you're you're
 
00:32:56.389 --> 00:32:56.399 align:start position:0%
giving them a general direction
 
00:32:59.509 --> 00:32:59.519 align:start position:0%
uh there
 
00:33:01.909 --> 00:33:01.919 align:start position:0%
they are there may be there may be
 
00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
follow-ons this is the
 
00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:06.720 align:start position:0%
this is this is the first step
 
00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
at least in my in my view
 
00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:14.720 align:start position:0%
uh did that answer your question
 
00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:17.200 align:start position:0%
maybe someone else's comparison to other
 
00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:17.830 align:start position:0%
maybe someone else's comparison to other
bills

00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
bills
 
00:33:22.149 --> 00:33:22.159 align:start position:0%
is this you would say this is a normal
 
00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:26.320 align:start position:0%
bill that in terms of
 
00:33:29.909 --> 00:33:29.919 align:start position:0%
uh at this at this point yeah uh
 
00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
what uh i'll go ask for some help from
 
00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:34.389 align:start position:0%
what uh i'll go ask for some help from
any

00:33:34.389 --> 00:33:34.399 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
anyone else and even the
 
00:33:40.149 --> 00:33:40.159 align:start position:0%
you know this is basically on general
 
00:33:42.389 --> 00:33:42.399 align:start position:0%
general procedures and general thoughts
 
00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:44.960 align:start position:0%
you might might you you you know when
 
00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:45.430 align:start position:0%
you might might you you you know when
you

00:33:45.430 --> 00:33:45.440 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:33:48.389 --> 00:33:48.399 align:start position:0%
when you put a bill like this a bill
 
00:33:50.389 --> 00:33:50.399 align:start position:0%
like this out
 
00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
which is on this section it's a general
 
00:33:57.269 --> 00:33:57.279 align:start position:0%
it is it has general uh general
 
00:34:00.549 --> 00:34:00.559 align:start position:0%
discussions representative
 
00:34:03.509 --> 00:34:03.519 align:start position:0%
representative gracie is it uh yes yeah
 
00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:04.480 align:start position:0%
just to give you a hand i mean
 
00:34:06.549 --> 00:34:06.559 align:start position:0%
you've explained it pretty well and uh
 
00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:08.720 align:start position:0%
chairman i think that what we do
 
00:34:11.589 --> 00:34:11.599 align:start position:0%
is we basically set up the the the
 
00:34:11.599 --> 00:34:12.869 align:start position:0%
is we basically set up the the the
structure

00:34:12.869 --> 00:34:12.879 align:start position:0%
structure
 
00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:14.720 align:start position:0%
and the direction we'd like to see it go
 
00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
and then the executive branch has to
 
00:34:17.430 --> 00:34:17.440 align:start position:0%
implement and
 
00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:20.240 align:start position:0%
develop and implement the rules that
 
00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:21.349 align:start position:0%
develop and implement the rules that
support

00:34:21.349 --> 00:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
support
 
00:34:22.950 --> 00:34:22.960 align:start position:0%
the direction we're asking them to move
 
00:34:25.270 --> 00:34:25.280 align:start position:0%
in so this is not unusual and this is
 
00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
what most of our bills look like
 
00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:30.560 align:start position:0%
um we say we need to address this issue
 
00:34:33.349 --> 00:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
how the technicalities of how we address
 
00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:35.200 align:start position:0%
it and more in the minutia that's
 
00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:35.829 align:start position:0%
it and more in the minutia that's
developed

00:34:35.829 --> 00:34:35.839 align:start position:0%
developed
 
00:34:37.669 --> 00:34:37.679 align:start position:0%
in the rules within the departments that
 
00:34:39.430 --> 00:34:39.440 align:start position:0%
are responsible to enforce it
 
00:34:41.589 --> 00:34:41.599 align:start position:0%
and they have to figure out how they can
 
00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:42.720 align:start position:0%
enforce something
 
00:34:44.470 --> 00:34:44.480 align:start position:0%
what they're capable of doing what their
 
00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:45.909 align:start position:0%
what they're capable of doing what their
financial

00:34:45.909 --> 00:34:45.919 align:start position:0%
financial
 
00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:48.720 align:start position:0%
availability is and they make those
 
00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:49.669 align:start position:0%
availability is and they make those
rules

00:34:49.669 --> 00:34:49.679 align:start position:0%
rules
 
00:34:55.589 --> 00:34:55.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:01.589 --> 00:35:01.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:06.069 --> 00:35:06.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:08.640 align:start position:0%
we're putting forth something that we
 
00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:10.240 align:start position:0%
have no idea what the rules are going to
 
00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:10.630 align:start position:0%
have no idea what the rules are going to
be

00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:10.640 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:35:13.829 --> 00:35:13.839 align:start position:0%
and if it's going to work and um
 
00:35:17.829 --> 00:35:17.839 align:start position:0%
again i just maybe it's a freshman thing
 
00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
but i i would like to see something
 
00:35:21.430 --> 00:35:21.440 align:start position:0%
tightened up
 
00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
or or you know i guess
 
00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:27.200 align:start position:0%
if we don't like what happens with it as
 
00:35:28.870 --> 00:35:28.880 align:start position:0%
a legislature we change it
 
00:35:32.310 --> 00:35:32.320 align:start position:0%
correct yeah absolutely racers do have
 
00:35:35.349 --> 00:35:35.359 align:start position:0%
pencils who have erasers survive
 
00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:38.640 align:start position:0%
except that we do pens now
 
00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
but yes but yeah if there are issues
 
00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:44.720 align:start position:0%
we will get involved but normally in
 
00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:45.270 align:start position:0%
we will get involved but normally in
such

00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:45.280 align:start position:0%
such
 
00:35:49.349 --> 00:35:49.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
there will be issues around funding
 
00:35:53.109 --> 00:35:53.119 align:start position:0%
things like that
 
00:35:56.829 --> 00:35:56.839 align:start position:0%
there's always going to be uh
 
00:35:59.510 --> 00:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
legislation in governing is an iterative
 
00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:02.310 align:start position:0%
legislation in governing is an iterative
process

00:36:02.310 --> 00:36:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:04.870 --> 00:36:04.880 align:start position:0%
yeah we may of course we might not see
 
00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:06.880 align:start position:0%
this again because this is a sufficient
 
00:36:10.470 --> 00:36:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:14.480 align:start position:0%
so uh but now that you asked a question
 
00:36:15.270 --> 00:36:15.280 align:start position:0%
also around
 
00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:18.720 align:start position:0%
the amendments uh
 
00:36:22.069 --> 00:36:22.079 align:start position:0%
we could you
 
00:36:25.109 --> 00:36:25.119 align:start position:0%
you there is the ability to put forth an
 
00:36:25.119 --> 00:36:25.750 align:start position:0%
you there is the ability to put forth an
amendment

00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:36:28.950 --> 00:36:28.960 align:start position:0%
we can't just we can take this
 
00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:32.320 align:start position:0%
portion out as per as an amendment
 
00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
if uh but uh you know we'd have to have
 
00:36:36.069 --> 00:36:36.079 align:start position:0%
one and
 
00:36:38.829 --> 00:36:38.839 align:start position:0%
have to have one put together we'd have
 
00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:41.200 align:start position:0%
to uh vote on
 
00:36:45.190 --> 00:36:45.200 align:start position:0%
uh if if you would like we can take a
 
00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:48.880 align:start position:0%
straw poll uh wouldn't be a
 
00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:50.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't fit they'll wouldn't it
 
00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it would not
 
00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:55.200 align:start position:0%
be an amendment but if if you uh if you
 
00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:56.950 align:start position:0%
be an amendment but if if you uh if you
felt

00:36:56.950 --> 00:36:56.960 align:start position:0%
felt
 
00:36:59.750 --> 00:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh you want you you know you wanted to
 
00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:00.640 align:start position:0%
see this
 
00:37:03.829 --> 00:37:03.839 align:start position:0%
section removed you could ask and i
 
00:37:03.839 --> 00:37:05.990 align:start position:0%
section removed you could ask and i
would

00:37:05.990 --> 00:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:37:09.109 --> 00:37:09.119 align:start position:0%
i would i would then ask in your behalf
 
00:37:12.310 --> 00:37:12.320 align:start position:0%
for a uh just a straw poll for who
 
00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:15.760 align:start position:0%
would look who would like an amendment
 
00:37:18.870 --> 00:37:18.880 align:start position:0%
who would support an amendment to put
 
00:37:21.990 --> 00:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
to remove the uh remove this section
 
00:37:25.270 --> 00:37:25.280 align:start position:0%
uh if it doesn't
 
00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:27.200 align:start position:0%
you know but if obviously if it doesn't
 
00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:28.960 align:start position:0%
uh if you don't get a
 
00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
plurality it's not gonna right
 
00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:34.240 align:start position:0%
yeah it would be you wouldn't be worth
 
00:37:36.150 --> 00:37:36.160 align:start position:0%
our time to go and get one right
 
00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
to vote so it's your choice
 
00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:42.800 align:start position:0%
so i would like to um see if there was
 
00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
any interest
 
00:37:46.710 --> 00:37:46.720 align:start position:0%
in removing it all right
 
00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:55.910 --> 00:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
when the fishing game department
 
00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:56.870 align:start position:0%
when the fishing game department
testified

00:37:56.870 --> 00:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
testified
 
00:38:00.630 --> 00:38:00.640 align:start position:0%
on this did they reflect
 
00:38:04.390 --> 00:38:04.400 align:start position:0%
whether there was current law concerning
 
00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
tsunami animals uh there
 
00:38:11.430 --> 00:38:11.440 align:start position:0%
are uh there are a lot of i did not
 
00:38:14.870 --> 00:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
hear that they were they did say that
 
00:38:15.349 --> 00:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
there are
 
00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:18.880 align:start position:0%
a lot and they indicated that there was
 
00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
laws concerning uh domestic
 
00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:26.640 align:start position:0%
uh you know domesticated animals
 
00:38:27.430 --> 00:38:27.440 align:start position:0%
especially around
 
00:38:31.990 --> 00:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
health and stuff like that uh
 
00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
i can't recall they're testifying to
 
00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
whether there were other what what other
 
00:38:39.829 --> 00:38:39.839 align:start position:0%
laws existed
 
00:38:43.349 --> 00:38:43.359 align:start position:0%
unfortunately fish and game were sitting
 
00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:44.240 align:start position:0%
where you
 
00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:47.680 align:start position:0%
there was the chair in the fishing game
 
00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:51.680 align:start position:0%
and several other representatives
 
00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
they were doing a bunch of the
 
00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
questioning and we were listening
 
00:38:59.349 --> 00:38:59.359 align:start position:0%
i do not recall any
 
00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:03.440 align:start position:0%
any mention of the follow-up yeah
 
00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:06.720 align:start position:0%
it would seem to be that if there isn't
 
00:39:10.390 --> 00:39:10.400 align:start position:0%
any state law concerning this there
 
00:39:11.589 --> 00:39:11.599 align:start position:0%
needs to be
 
00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:15.200 align:start position:0%
some sort of enabling legislation
 
00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:18.640 align:start position:0%
so that if something happens let's say
 
00:39:21.829 --> 00:39:21.839 align:start position:0%
we discover that there's diseases that
 
00:39:24.150 --> 00:39:24.160 align:start position:0%
are being transmitted from
 
00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
a domestic animal that we currently
 
00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:30.720 align:start position:0%
let's say bulldogs for instance
 
00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden we figure out that
 
00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:34.150 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden we figure out that
bulldogs

00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
bulldogs
 
00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
transmit disease to humans well then we
 
00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
would need
 
00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:42.640 align:start position:0%
something in the statutes to allow
 
00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
fish and game to take care of that i
 
00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
would i would probably i would say i
 
00:39:53.349 --> 00:39:53.359 align:start position:0%
think that there is such data
 
00:39:56.230 --> 00:39:56.240 align:start position:0%
but you know you have uh in front of the
 
00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:13.990 --> 00:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
just so you can look at the
 
00:40:16.710 --> 00:40:16.720 align:start position:0%
i have the bill you have the bill you
 
00:40:17.349 --> 00:40:17.359 align:start position:0%
have the bill
 
00:40:21.109 --> 00:40:21.119 align:start position:0%
uh what do you say um
 
00:40:24.550 --> 00:40:24.560 align:start position:0%
146 the original
 
00:40:32.069 --> 00:40:32.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:36.390 --> 00:40:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:51.430 --> 00:40:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:54.309 --> 00:40:54.319 align:start position:0%
this the this is a very the bill is
 
00:40:58.710 --> 00:40:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:01.109 --> 00:41:01.119 align:start position:0%
if you read the fire if you want a copy
 
00:41:01.750 --> 00:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
of it
 
00:41:03.829 --> 00:41:03.839 align:start position:0%
just to be able to do detroit to be able
 
00:41:05.190 --> 00:41:05.200 align:start position:0%
to read the
 
00:41:08.069 --> 00:41:08.079 align:start position:0%
specific section of the bill it doesn't
 
00:41:09.430 --> 00:41:09.440 align:start position:0%
change much of any
 
00:41:16.309 --> 00:41:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:19.990 --> 00:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
but i would i can't i can't
 
00:41:23.430 --> 00:41:23.440 align:start position:0%
give you a definitive answer on whether
 
00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:26.640 align:start position:0%
you can or can't uh
 
00:41:31.430 --> 00:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
what the law of read concerning and the
 
00:41:35.190 --> 00:41:35.200 align:start position:0%
the powers of fish and game and
 
00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
in the department of agriculture and the
 
00:41:39.430 --> 00:41:39.440 align:start position:0%
health and human services
 
00:41:40.950 --> 00:41:40.960 align:start position:0%
i would be surprised that they didn't
 
00:41:43.109 --> 00:41:43.119 align:start position:0%
have stuff already in place
 
00:41:46.150 --> 00:41:46.160 align:start position:0%
around those issues
 
00:41:48.870 --> 00:41:48.880 align:start position:0%
this is around the mixing of the and
 
00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:50.230 align:start position:0%
this is around the mixing of the and
handling

00:41:50.230 --> 00:41:50.240 align:start position:0%
handling
 
00:41:53.589 --> 00:41:53.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:57.670 --> 00:41:57.680 align:start position:0%
these these type of these
 
00:42:00.829 --> 00:42:00.839 align:start position:0%
these uh these type of these
 
00:42:04.309 --> 00:42:04.319 align:start position:0%
wild the wild animals so yeah i remember
 
00:42:05.670 --> 00:42:05.680 align:start position:0%
that expanding
 
00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:08.640 align:start position:0%
smith all right okay uh who is first
 
00:42:09.430 --> 00:42:09.440 align:start position:0%
congress first
 
00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
uh let me uh let me
 
00:42:16.230 --> 00:42:16.240 align:start position:0%
okay okay uh representative spang for
 
00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:16.870 align:start position:0%
okay okay uh representative spang for
question

00:42:16.870 --> 00:42:16.880 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:20.640 align:start position:0%
or science thank you um
 
00:42:22.950 --> 00:42:22.960 align:start position:0%
by now the conversation haven't gone on
 
00:42:24.630 --> 00:42:24.640 align:start position:0%
i have a couple of comments the first
 
00:42:26.870 --> 00:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
one is relative to rules
 
00:42:28.950 --> 00:42:28.960 align:start position:0%
um we have found in the past that there
 
00:42:29.990 --> 00:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
is a serious
 
00:42:31.829 --> 00:42:31.839 align:start position:0%
problem if we try to put too many
 
00:42:31.839 --> 00:42:33.030 align:start position:0%
problem if we try to put too many
details

00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:33.040 align:start position:0%
details
 
00:42:36.069 --> 00:42:36.079 align:start position:0%
into statute because circumstances
 
00:42:36.079 --> 00:42:36.710 align:start position:0%
into statute because circumstances
change

00:42:36.710 --> 00:42:36.720 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:40.400 align:start position:0%
either outside the state house or within
 
00:42:43.349 --> 00:42:43.359 align:start position:0%
the agencies that make it impossible
 
00:42:46.470 --> 00:42:46.480 align:start position:0%
to adjust the way something is supposed
 
00:42:48.870 --> 00:42:48.880 align:start position:0%
to be handled by the agency
 
00:42:51.510 --> 00:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
the agency would have the flexibility to
 
00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:53.680 align:start position:0%
adapt to those changes if it weren't in
 
00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:54.790 align:start position:0%
adapt to those changes if it weren't in
statute

00:42:54.790 --> 00:42:54.800 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:42:56.870 --> 00:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
and didn't require an act of the
 
00:42:58.069 --> 00:42:58.079 align:start position:0%
legislature to
 
00:43:01.190 --> 00:43:01.200 align:start position:0%
tweak basically tweak a procedure
 
00:43:04.230 --> 00:43:04.240 align:start position:0%
that the agency would be bringing in so
 
00:43:07.349 --> 00:43:07.359 align:start position:0%
i have great faith in the agencies to be
 
00:43:09.510 --> 00:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
able to do what they can afford to do
 
00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
under the circumstances that they are
 
00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:13.510 align:start position:0%
under the circumstances that they are
facing

00:43:13.510 --> 00:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
facing
 
00:43:15.990 --> 00:43:16.000 align:start position:0%
the other thing is i wanted to mention
 
00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:16.550 align:start position:0%
the other thing is i wanted to mention
that

00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:43:19.510 --> 00:43:19.520 align:start position:0%
there are always hearings before rules
 
00:43:22.069 --> 00:43:22.079 align:start position:0%
while there is rule making going on
 
00:43:24.309 --> 00:43:24.319 align:start position:0%
and that that's an opportunity for the
 
00:43:27.430 --> 00:43:27.440 align:start position:0%
people who are affected
 
00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:30.720 align:start position:0%
to have input into the proposed
 
00:43:33.270 --> 00:43:33.280 align:start position:0%
rules and also legislators can
 
00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
participate in those hearings
 
00:43:38.390 --> 00:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
and influence what they think the rules
 
00:43:39.270 --> 00:43:39.280 align:start position:0%
should be
 
00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
so it isn't as though we're just giving
 
00:43:42.470 --> 00:43:42.480 align:start position:0%
them a carte blanche
 
00:43:46.069 --> 00:43:46.079 align:start position:0%
and then seeing what they make of it um
 
00:43:50.630 --> 00:43:50.640 align:start position:0%
and i um i'm also next page i noticed
 
00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:51.270 align:start position:0%
and i um i'm also next page i noticed
that

00:43:51.270 --> 00:43:51.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:43:54.309 --> 00:43:54.319 align:start position:0%
uh section two is
 
00:43:57.190 --> 00:43:57.200 align:start position:0%
does not relate strictly to the markets
 
00:43:58.710 --> 00:43:58.720 align:start position:0%
and i agree the market
 
00:44:03.430 --> 00:44:03.440 align:start position:0%
seems to be kind of um 3 000 miles away
 
00:44:06.550 --> 00:44:06.560 align:start position:0%
but it would certainly be
 
00:44:09.109 --> 00:44:09.119 align:start position:0%
embarrassing to be caught in the covet
 
00:44:11.109 --> 00:44:11.119 align:start position:0%
kind of situation when we've certainly
 
00:44:11.829 --> 00:44:11.839 align:start position:0%
been well
 
00:44:14.630 --> 00:44:14.640 align:start position:0%
warned what happens however where it
 
00:44:15.589 --> 00:44:15.599 align:start position:0%
talks about
 
00:44:18.630 --> 00:44:18.640 align:start position:0%
wildlife species that are not
 
00:44:22.230 --> 00:44:22.240 align:start position:0%
part of a market but they're caged and
 
00:44:24.550 --> 00:44:24.560 align:start position:0%
handled and transported with livestock
 
00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:26.240 align:start position:0%
or domestic animals
 
00:44:29.349 --> 00:44:29.359 align:start position:0%
there are really uh severe consequences
 
00:44:30.390 --> 00:44:30.400 align:start position:0%
when wildlife
 
00:44:33.829 --> 00:44:33.839 align:start position:0%
carries a disease to a uh
 
00:44:37.430 --> 00:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
a herd of cattle for example so i think
 
00:44:38.870 --> 00:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
that this
 
00:44:42.309 --> 00:44:42.319 align:start position:0%
though the market part of it seems a
 
00:44:42.319 --> 00:44:42.790 align:start position:0%
though the market part of it seems a
little

00:44:42.790 --> 00:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
little
 
00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
far-fetched in our current environment
 
00:44:49.510 --> 00:44:49.520 align:start position:0%
i think that that addressing that whole
 
00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:50.230 align:start position:0%
i think that that addressing that whole
problem

00:44:50.230 --> 00:44:50.240 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:44:53.270 --> 00:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
of transferring of of
 
00:44:57.030 --> 00:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
these diseases into our own domestic
 
00:45:00.069 --> 00:45:00.079 align:start position:0%
animals be they pets or herds
 
00:45:03.990 --> 00:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
and thence to humans absolutely must be
 
00:45:07.270 --> 00:45:07.280 align:start position:0%
controlled so you know i think this is a
 
00:45:10.309 --> 00:45:10.319 align:start position:0%
a matter of an ounce of caution
 
00:45:13.349 --> 00:45:13.359 align:start position:0%
um and i and when i first saw the bill i
 
00:45:13.359 --> 00:45:13.750 align:start position:0%
um and i and when i first saw the bill i
thought

00:45:13.750 --> 00:45:13.760 align:start position:0%
thought
 
00:45:16.790 --> 00:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
give me a break but the more i thought
 
00:45:17.990 --> 00:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
about it and the
 
00:45:21.349 --> 00:45:21.359 align:start position:0%
closer i read it i began to think why
 
00:45:27.109 --> 00:45:27.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:29.910 --> 00:45:29.920 align:start position:0%
okay representative smith for uh comment
 
00:45:31.349 --> 00:45:31.359 align:start position:0%
a question
 
00:45:33.990 --> 00:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
uh yeah the the first thing i wanted to
 
00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:34.390 align:start position:0%
uh yeah the the first thing i wanted to
say

00:45:34.390 --> 00:45:34.400 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:45:38.950 --> 00:45:38.960 align:start position:0%
is that um those of us who are uh
 
00:45:41.829 --> 00:45:41.839 align:start position:0%
here remotely have no idea who the
 
00:45:43.589 --> 00:45:43.599 align:start position:0%
person is who is speaking
 
00:45:46.710 --> 00:45:46.720 align:start position:0%
in the committee room um unless
 
00:45:48.150 --> 00:45:48.160 align:start position:0%
you know it's the chair because i
 
00:45:49.750 --> 00:45:49.760 align:start position:0%
recognize his voice
 
00:45:53.510 --> 00:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
but um if if we can if
 
00:45:55.430 --> 00:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
we can hear their name at some point so
 
00:45:56.870 --> 00:45:56.880 align:start position:0%
we know which
 
00:45:58.630 --> 00:45:58.640 align:start position:0%
member of which colleague of ours is
 
00:46:00.309 --> 00:46:00.319 align:start position:0%
speaking that would be helpful
 
00:46:02.710 --> 00:46:02.720 align:start position:0%
the other comment i wanted to make is we
 
00:46:04.550 --> 00:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
have a lot of questions that seem to be
 
00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:05.750 align:start position:0%
have a lot of questions that seem to be
directed

00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
directed
 
00:46:08.069 --> 00:46:08.079 align:start position:0%
um towards fish and game and paul
 
00:46:10.710 --> 00:46:10.720 align:start position:0%
sanderson's testimony and paul sanderson
 
00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:11.510 align:start position:0%
sanderson's testimony and paul sanderson
is

00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:46:14.390 --> 00:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
in the meeting and if we have questions
 
00:46:15.990 --> 00:46:16.000 align:start position:0%
maybe he could be best
 
00:46:17.910 --> 00:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
answering them as opposed to us trying
 
00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:31.630 --> 00:46:31.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:36.150 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:46:36.150 --> 00:46:36.160 align:start position:0%

and ask that it
 
00:47:00.870 --> 00:47:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:04.230 --> 00:47:04.240 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm a rookie at this uh

well i i think uh have you been uh
 
00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
hearing uh some of the discussion that's
 
00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:17.109 align:start position:0%
hearing uh some of the discussion that's
uh

00:47:17.109 --> 00:47:17.119 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:47:18.950 --> 00:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
yes and i i would give you this comment
 
00:47:21.190 --> 00:47:21.200 align:start position:0%
with regard to existing laws
 
00:47:23.910 --> 00:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
you'll note here that this particular uh
 
00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:24.549 align:start position:0%
you'll note here that this particular uh
bill

00:47:24.549 --> 00:47:24.559 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:47:27.829 --> 00:47:27.839 align:start position:0%
looks to add a new section 207 14 a
 
00:47:31.349 --> 00:47:31.359 align:start position:0%
207 14 already provides us with certain
 
00:47:31.359 --> 00:47:31.910 align:start position:0%
207 14 already provides us with certain
powers

00:47:31.910 --> 00:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
powers
 
00:47:34.470 --> 00:47:34.480 align:start position:0%
with regard to importation possession or
 
00:47:36.309 --> 00:47:36.319 align:start position:0%
release of wildlife
 
00:47:38.790 --> 00:47:38.800 align:start position:0%
and we in fact have an entire series of
 
00:47:40.069 --> 00:47:40.079 align:start position:0%
administrative rules
 
00:47:43.589 --> 00:47:43.599 align:start position:0%
fis 800 uh by which we administer
 
00:47:46.470 --> 00:47:46.480 align:start position:0%
that particular duty uh we also have
 
00:47:48.390 --> 00:47:48.400 align:start position:0%
powers that are given to the executive
 
00:47:50.390 --> 00:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
director in rsa 206
 
00:47:53.589 --> 00:47:53.599 align:start position:0%
10 gives the authority to deal with
 
00:47:55.349 --> 00:47:55.359 align:start position:0%
the movement of animals across state
 
00:47:57.270 --> 00:47:57.280 align:start position:0%
lines that might cause the introduction
 
00:47:58.390 --> 00:47:58.400 align:start position:0%
of disease
 
00:48:01.589 --> 00:48:01.599 align:start position:0%
however senator waters identified and we
 
00:48:02.870 --> 00:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
certainly agree with him
 
00:48:05.349 --> 00:48:05.359 align:start position:0%
that there is a tremendous opportunity
 
00:48:06.069 --> 00:48:06.079 align:start position:0%
here for
 
00:48:08.870 --> 00:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
transmission not only among wildlife but
 
00:48:10.950 --> 00:48:10.960 align:start position:0%
also among domesticated animals
 
00:48:12.549 --> 00:48:12.559 align:start position:0%
and what he was really trying to do here
 
00:48:14.309 --> 00:48:14.319 align:start position:0%
was make sure that the departments are
 
00:48:15.910 --> 00:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
working together
 
00:48:19.030 --> 00:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
in order to be both vigilant and to
 
00:48:20.069 --> 00:48:20.079 align:start position:0%
identify this
 
00:48:22.230 --> 00:48:22.240 align:start position:0%
and bring the issue to the legislature
 
00:48:24.069 --> 00:48:24.079 align:start position:0%
and the governor's office in the event
 
00:48:25.910 --> 00:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
that action is required
 
00:48:28.230 --> 00:48:28.240 align:start position:0%
so it is it is exactly what the members
 
00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
have identified it is its authorization
 
00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:32.069 align:start position:0%
have identified it is its authorization
legislation

00:48:32.069 --> 00:48:32.079 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:48:33.990 --> 00:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
we do adopt rules they will be placed
 
00:48:37.109 --> 00:48:37.119 align:start position:0%
into our existing fis 800 series
 
00:48:40.150 --> 00:48:40.160 align:start position:0%
and it fills in the gap that uh we have
 
00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:40.549 align:start position:0%
and it fills in the gap that uh we have
here

00:48:40.549 --> 00:48:40.559 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
with regard to what we've learned from
 
00:48:44.950 --> 00:48:44.960 align:start position:0%
the cobit 19 experience
 
00:48:48.710 --> 00:48:48.720 align:start position:0%
i hope that answers your questions uh
 
00:48:52.150 --> 00:48:52.160 align:start position:0%
one of the questions k uh came up uh
 
00:48:55.589 --> 00:48:55.599 align:start position:0%
that well why do you need legislation to
 
00:48:55.599 --> 00:48:56.150 align:start position:0%
that well why do you need legislation to
be

00:48:56.150 --> 00:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:48:59.190 --> 00:48:59.200 align:start position:0%
pointed and you know do this do that
 
00:49:02.630 --> 00:49:02.640 align:start position:0%
can't you just do that on your own or uh
 
00:49:05.670 --> 00:49:05.680 align:start position:0%
can you respond to that uh
 
00:49:07.750 --> 00:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
you know that why you think the
 
00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:08.710 align:start position:0%
you know that why you think the
legislation

00:49:08.710 --> 00:49:08.720 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:49:11.829 --> 00:49:11.839 align:start position:0%
uh is important to be able to that
 
00:49:13.670 --> 00:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
that is gives us gives you some kind of
 
00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:14.950 align:start position:0%
that is gives us gives you some kind of
direction

00:49:14.950 --> 00:49:14.960 align:start position:0%
direction
 
00:49:16.549 --> 00:49:16.559 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question mr
 
00:49:18.870 --> 00:49:18.880 align:start position:0%
chairman the the reason that authorizing
 
00:49:21.190 --> 00:49:21.200 align:start position:0%
legislation is important is because of
 
00:49:23.750 --> 00:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
the question of enforcement
 
00:49:25.510 --> 00:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
we would in fact be looking for these
 
00:49:27.190 --> 00:49:27.200 align:start position:0%
sorts of things but if we have no
 
00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:29.200 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation that allows us to
 
00:49:31.750 --> 00:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
move forward to take action
 
00:49:34.230 --> 00:49:34.240 align:start position:0%
that might involve the seizure of
 
00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:35.430 align:start position:0%
that might involve the seizure of
particular

00:49:35.430 --> 00:49:35.440 align:start position:0%
particular
 
00:49:37.910 --> 00:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
items of property or the seizure of
 
00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:39.589 align:start position:0%
items of property or the seizure of
wildlife

00:49:39.589 --> 00:49:39.599 align:start position:0%
wildlife
 
00:49:41.510 --> 00:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
cooperation with other departments then
 
00:49:43.030 --> 00:49:43.040 align:start position:0%
we might be
 
00:49:45.829 --> 00:49:45.839 align:start position:0%
less able to effectively deal with an
 
00:49:50.309 --> 00:49:50.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:52.470 --> 00:49:52.480 align:start position:0%
we would be doing this in conjunction
 
00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
with the governor's office the attorney
 
00:49:55.270 --> 00:49:55.280 align:start position:0%
general's office
 
00:49:57.430 --> 00:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
the department of agriculture and the
 
00:49:59.829 --> 00:49:59.839 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
00:50:03.270 --> 00:50:03.280 align:start position:0%
um we certainly take uh property rights
 
00:50:05.510 --> 00:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
very seriously but we also take human
 
00:50:07.589 --> 00:50:07.599 align:start position:0%
disease very seriously
 
00:50:09.990 --> 00:50:10.000 align:start position:0%
and would not be looking to go out and
 
00:50:11.190 --> 00:50:11.200 align:start position:0%
do these sorts of things
 
00:50:14.630 --> 00:50:14.640 align:start position:0%
on our own we recently had an incident
 
00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:15.190 align:start position:0%
on our own we recently had an incident
here

00:50:15.190 --> 00:50:15.200 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:50:17.750 --> 00:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh not involving the transmission of
 
00:50:19.750 --> 00:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
disease but the transmission of invasive
 
00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:21.670 align:start position:0%
disease but the transmission of invasive
species

00:50:21.670 --> 00:50:21.680 align:start position:0%
species
 
00:50:23.829 --> 00:50:23.839 align:start position:0%
in our case it was question of zebra
 
00:50:25.030 --> 00:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
mussels that
 
00:50:28.309 --> 00:50:28.319 align:start position:0%
are invasive species
 
00:50:30.950 --> 00:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
they were being imported into our state
 
00:50:34.390 --> 00:50:34.400 align:start position:0%
and being sold as part of
 
00:50:37.190 --> 00:50:37.200 align:start position:0%
aquatic items that we placed inside fish
 
00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:38.309 align:start position:0%
aquatic items that we placed inside fish
tanks

00:50:38.309 --> 00:50:38.319 align:start position:0%
tanks
 
00:50:40.549 --> 00:50:40.559 align:start position:0%
if they had ever escaped and gone out
 
00:50:42.230 --> 00:50:42.240 align:start position:0%
into the environment they
 
00:50:44.710 --> 00:50:44.720 align:start position:0%
multiply rapidly have no particular
 
00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:45.670 align:start position:0%
multiply rapidly have no particular
predators

00:50:45.670 --> 00:50:45.680 align:start position:0%
predators
 
00:50:47.750 --> 00:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
and can cause tremendous damage to water
 
00:50:50.069 --> 00:50:50.079 align:start position:0%
systems and sewer systems
 
00:50:52.230 --> 00:50:52.240 align:start position:0%
so in that case we worked closely with
 
00:50:55.109 --> 00:50:55.119 align:start position:0%
the u.s fish and wildlife service
 
00:50:56.309 --> 00:50:56.319 align:start position:0%
closely with the department of
 
00:50:58.309 --> 00:50:58.319 align:start position:0%
agriculture because they're the ones who
 
00:51:00.309 --> 00:51:00.319 align:start position:0%
regulate pet stores where these were
 
00:51:01.430 --> 00:51:01.440 align:start position:0%
being sold
 
00:51:02.790 --> 00:51:02.800 align:start position:0%
the department of health and human
 
00:51:04.710 --> 00:51:04.720 align:start position:0%
services and also
 
00:51:06.069 --> 00:51:06.079 align:start position:0%
governor's office and the attorney
 
00:51:08.790 --> 00:51:08.800 align:start position:0%
general's office to effectively contain
 
00:51:12.069 --> 00:51:12.079 align:start position:0%
that particular importation the system
 
00:51:12.630 --> 00:51:12.640 align:start position:0%
is there
 
00:51:15.829 --> 00:51:15.839 align:start position:0%
and the system works and it's something
 
00:51:17.270 --> 00:51:17.280 align:start position:0%
where we take these
 
00:51:19.270 --> 00:51:19.280 align:start position:0%
these issues seriously but in
 
00:51:21.190 --> 00:51:21.200 align:start position:0%
cooperation with our colleagues across
 
00:51:26.309 --> 00:51:26.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:29.589 --> 00:51:29.599 align:start position:0%
uh representative post for a question
 
00:51:32.470 --> 00:51:32.480 align:start position:0%
from mr sanderson yes thank you mr chair
 
00:51:36.470 --> 00:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
um so the my question is um
 
00:51:38.870 --> 00:51:38.880 align:start position:0%
you have something in place so the
 
00:51:39.670 --> 00:51:39.680 align:start position:0%
addition is
 
00:51:43.270 --> 00:51:43.280 align:start position:0%
just this part
 
00:51:47.030 --> 00:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
three is just put in to identify
 
00:51:50.710 --> 00:51:50.720 align:start position:0%
wildlife not mixing with domestic
 
00:51:54.470 --> 00:51:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:57.589 --> 00:51:57.599 align:start position:0%
the other question on that is um
 
00:52:00.470 --> 00:52:00.480 align:start position:0%
could you talk about the logistics of
 
00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:01.349 align:start position:0%
could you talk about the logistics of
how

00:52:01.349 --> 00:52:01.359 align:start position:0%
how
 
00:52:03.750 --> 00:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
the people who have boots on the ground
 
00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:04.470 align:start position:0%
the people who have boots on the ground
who

00:52:04.470 --> 00:52:04.480 align:start position:0%
who
 
00:52:07.510 --> 00:52:07.520 align:start position:0%
would be looking for this would
 
00:52:10.870 --> 00:52:10.880 align:start position:0%
how things would happen or traditionally
 
00:52:12.790 --> 00:52:12.800 align:start position:0%
how they do happen in finding these
 
00:52:16.309 --> 00:52:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:18.710 --> 00:52:18.720 align:start position:0%
yes if i go back to the example that i
 
00:52:19.670 --> 00:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
just used
 
00:52:23.910 --> 00:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
of the zebra mussels the question of
 
00:52:25.829 --> 00:52:25.839 align:start position:0%
the invasive species moving into the
 
00:52:27.750 --> 00:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
state was actually first identified by
 
00:52:30.309 --> 00:52:30.319 align:start position:0%
the u.s fish and wildlife service
 
00:52:34.230 --> 00:52:34.240 align:start position:0%
and rely upon us as their state partners
 
00:52:36.470 --> 00:52:36.480 align:start position:0%
to actually implement this within the
 
00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:37.349 align:start position:0%
to actually implement this within the
state

00:52:37.349 --> 00:52:37.359 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:52:40.150 --> 00:52:40.160 align:start position:0%
so when we talk about um the first part
 
00:52:40.790 --> 00:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
which is
 
00:52:42.950 --> 00:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
this the scanning the idea of
 
00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:44.829 align:start position:0%
this the scanning the idea of
identifying

00:52:44.829 --> 00:52:44.839 align:start position:0%
identifying
 
00:52:47.589 --> 00:52:47.599 align:start position:0%
issues any agencies in fact
 
00:52:49.430 --> 00:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
are watching for things like this at
 
00:52:51.190 --> 00:52:51.200 align:start position:0%
both the federal and state level
 
00:52:53.990 --> 00:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
once the threat is identified then they
 
00:52:55.670 --> 00:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
will come to the agency
 
00:52:58.390 --> 00:52:58.400 align:start position:0%
that is most able to deal with where the
 
00:53:00.549 --> 00:53:00.559 align:start position:0%
threat seems to be located
 
00:53:02.549 --> 00:53:02.559 align:start position:0%
if it was dealing for example with
 
00:53:04.549 --> 00:53:04.559 align:start position:0%
domesticated animals in their movement
 
00:53:06.069 --> 00:53:06.079 align:start position:0%
they would be going to the department of
 
00:53:06.079 --> 00:53:07.510 align:start position:0%
they would be going to the department of
agriculture

00:53:07.510 --> 00:53:07.520 align:start position:0%
agriculture
 
00:53:09.990 --> 00:53:10.000 align:start position:0%
uh but of course there could be a risk
 
00:53:11.829 --> 00:53:11.839 align:start position:0%
if there had been exposure to wildlife
 
00:53:15.109 --> 00:53:15.119 align:start position:0%
along the way and that would involve us
 
00:53:17.589 --> 00:53:17.599 align:start position:0%
so as we talk about boots on the ground
 
00:53:19.190 --> 00:53:19.200 align:start position:0%
it really is
 
00:53:21.030 --> 00:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
this idea of identification and
 
00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
screening and then trying to develop a
 
00:53:25.109 --> 00:53:25.119 align:start position:0%
response that is most likely to be
 
00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
protective of human health
 
00:53:29.030 --> 00:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
and also respective of private property
 
00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:30.230 align:start position:0%
and also respective of private property
rights

00:53:30.230 --> 00:53:30.240 align:start position:0%
rights
 
00:53:32.150 --> 00:53:32.160 align:start position:0%
i know that's a very general answer but
 
00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:33.520 align:start position:0%
on the other hand
 
00:53:35.349 --> 00:53:35.359 align:start position:0%
these issues i think are somewhat unique
 
00:53:38.470 --> 00:53:38.480 align:start position:0%
as they present themselves
 
00:53:42.069 --> 00:53:42.079 align:start position:0%
thank you any other
 
00:53:45.109 --> 00:53:45.119 align:start position:0%
uh any other questions uh
 
00:53:48.710 --> 00:53:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:51.750 --> 00:53:51.760 align:start position:0%
um thank you mr chair um i
 
00:53:56.790 --> 00:53:56.800 align:start position:0%
i took that to um you know
 
00:53:58.230 --> 00:53:58.240 align:start position:0%
the intent of the bill i just had a
 
00:54:00.470 --> 00:54:00.480 align:start position:0%
question of it says in the bill
 
00:54:03.349 --> 00:54:03.359 align:start position:0%
um the efficiency department monitor
 
00:54:03.359 --> 00:54:04.630 align:start position:0%
um the efficiency department monitor
available

00:54:04.630 --> 00:54:04.640 align:start position:0%
available
 
00:54:06.870 --> 00:54:06.880 align:start position:0%
uh general official not currently
 
00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:08.069 align:start position:0%
uh general official not currently
restricted

00:54:08.069 --> 00:54:08.079 align:start position:0%
restricted
 
00:54:09.589 --> 00:54:09.599 align:start position:0%
under state and federal wildlife
 
00:54:11.109 --> 00:54:11.119 align:start position:0%
trafficking laws
 
00:54:13.510 --> 00:54:13.520 align:start position:0%
is there any so it would be too
 
00:54:15.910 --> 00:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
difficult to just add these species
 
00:54:18.150 --> 00:54:18.160 align:start position:0%
to this list or is that is it just
 
00:54:19.910 --> 00:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
quicker to do it this way
 
00:54:26.390 --> 00:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:28.150 --> 00:54:28.160 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative i think your
 
00:54:29.829 --> 00:54:29.839 align:start position:0%
question is about how the monitoring
 
00:54:32.950 --> 00:54:32.960 align:start position:0%
occurs is that correct
 
00:54:36.950 --> 00:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
um yes that that would be helpful
 
00:54:37.829 --> 00:54:37.839 align:start position:0%
information but
 
00:54:41.910 --> 00:54:41.920 align:start position:0%
also so you already have restrictions
 
00:54:44.950 --> 00:54:44.960 align:start position:0%
on species under this current
 
00:54:46.870 --> 00:54:46.880 align:start position:0%
you know apparently listed a list of
 
00:54:46.880 --> 00:54:48.309 align:start position:0%
you know apparently listed a list of
animals

00:54:48.309 --> 00:54:48.319 align:start position:0%
animals
 
00:54:49.990 --> 00:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
that are restricted under state and
 
00:54:53.190 --> 00:54:53.200 align:start position:0%
federal wildlife trafficking mode
 
00:54:56.309 --> 00:54:56.319 align:start position:0%
so if there were a new species such as
 
00:54:57.910 --> 00:54:57.920 align:start position:0%
zebra mussels or
 
00:55:01.190 --> 00:55:01.200 align:start position:0%
fats or something would that just be
 
00:55:04.230 --> 00:55:04.240 align:start position:0%
added to the list
 
00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:06.880 align:start position:0%
yes yes representative if new species
 
00:55:08.710 --> 00:55:08.720 align:start position:0%
are identified or new specific threats
 
00:55:10.309 --> 00:55:10.319 align:start position:0%
are identified we can amend our
 
00:55:11.829 --> 00:55:11.839 align:start position:0%
administrative rules
 
00:55:14.069 --> 00:55:14.079 align:start position:0%
in order to determine whether those
 
00:55:15.430 --> 00:55:15.440 align:start position:0%
particular species
 
00:55:17.910 --> 00:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
should be taken and placed upon either a
 
00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:20.160 align:start position:0%
controlled or a prohibited list
 
00:55:23.270 --> 00:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
and yes those particular
 
00:55:25.030 --> 00:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
specific species are identified
 
00:55:28.950 --> 00:55:28.960 align:start position:0%
currently for us in our fis 800 rules
 
00:55:32.829 --> 00:55:32.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:32.839 --> 00:55:43.589 align:start position:0%
 
information

00:55:43.589 --> 00:55:43.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:48.230 --> 00:55:48.240 align:start position:0%
but this language you want this language
 
00:55:51.349 --> 00:55:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:53.349 --> 00:55:53.359 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative yes even the
 
00:55:54.710 --> 00:55:54.720 align:start position:0%
process of amendment with an
 
00:55:56.470 --> 00:55:56.480 align:start position:0%
administrative rule takes six to nine
 
00:55:56.480 --> 00:55:57.670 align:start position:0%
administrative rule takes six to nine
months

00:55:57.670 --> 00:55:57.680 align:start position:0%
months
 
00:55:59.589 --> 00:55:59.599 align:start position:0%
unless we do something on an emergency
 
00:56:00.870 --> 00:56:00.880 align:start position:0%
basis so
 
00:56:03.349 --> 00:56:03.359 align:start position:0%
this particular enabling legislation
 
00:56:05.349 --> 00:56:05.359 align:start position:0%
would enable us to act within a period
 
00:56:07.670 --> 00:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
of hours or days in cooperation
 
00:56:09.270 --> 00:56:09.280 align:start position:0%
with the attorney general's office and
 
00:56:11.510 --> 00:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
the governor's office to make sure that
 
00:56:13.190 --> 00:56:13.200 align:start position:0%
any threat to human health or
 
00:56:15.270 --> 00:56:15.280 align:start position:0%
to the value of private property was
 
00:56:17.750 --> 00:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
addressed immediately
 
00:56:19.990 --> 00:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
thank you it answers your question
 
00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:23.349 align:start position:0%
thank you it answers your question
representative

00:56:23.349 --> 00:56:23.359 align:start position:0%

thank you very thank you very much for
 
00:56:32.150 --> 00:56:32.160 align:start position:0%
your help

00:56:42.230 --> 00:56:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:45.750 --> 00:56:45.760 align:start position:0%
any other questions on this uh require
 
00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:46.470 align:start position:0%
any other questions on this uh require
comments

00:56:46.470 --> 00:56:46.480 align:start position:0%
comments
 
00:56:50.549 --> 00:56:50.559 align:start position:0%
uh if you have a well i'll
 
00:56:53.349 --> 00:56:53.359 align:start position:0%
i'm going to put a ask for a i will ask
 
00:56:53.990 --> 00:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
for a
 
00:56:57.430 --> 00:56:57.440 align:start position:0%
straw vote as to whether or not
 
00:57:00.789 --> 00:57:00.799 align:start position:0%
we would wish to remove this section
 
00:57:05.030 --> 00:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
from the bill uh anybody who would look
 
00:57:07.349 --> 00:57:07.359 align:start position:0%
to remove this section from the bill and
 
00:57:07.359 --> 00:57:09.030 align:start position:0%
to remove this section from the bill and
uh

00:57:09.030 --> 00:57:09.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:57:11.190 --> 00:57:11.200 align:start position:0%
should we put forward we would require
 
00:57:12.549 --> 00:57:12.559 align:start position:0%
putting a ger
 
00:57:15.670 --> 00:57:15.680 align:start position:0%
require recessing to get a uh an
 
00:57:17.670 --> 00:57:17.680 align:start position:0%
amendment if it looks like
 
00:57:21.190 --> 00:57:21.200 align:start position:0%
there would be a a
 
00:57:24.549 --> 00:57:24.559 align:start position:0%
majority uh all those who who would
 
00:57:28.230 --> 00:57:28.240 align:start position:0%
uh would favor an amendment
 
00:57:31.270 --> 00:57:31.280 align:start position:0%
uh please raise your hands
 
00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:35.190 align:start position:0%
uh please raise your hands
or

00:57:35.190 --> 00:57:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:38.470 --> 00:57:38.480 align:start position:0%
one is there anyone on the screen
 
00:57:40.870 --> 00:57:40.880 align:start position:0%
representative dodge has his handbrake
 
00:57:42.309 --> 00:57:42.319 align:start position:0%
representative dodge
 
00:57:45.430 --> 00:57:45.440 align:start position:0%
and representative post
 
00:57:50.390 --> 00:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:53.590 --> 00:57:53.600 align:start position:0%

00:58:02.520 --> 00:58:02.530 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
00:58:08.230 --> 00:58:08.240 align:start position:0%
uh so it's basically two two people
 
00:58:09.109 --> 00:58:09.119 align:start position:0%
would uh so
 
00:58:11.349 --> 00:58:11.359 align:start position:0%
if that would not pass i don't believe
 
00:58:12.230 --> 00:58:12.240 align:start position:0%
at least that might
 
00:58:15.030 --> 00:58:15.040 align:start position:0%
at least the way i count i i feel a
 
00:58:15.829 --> 00:58:15.839 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
00:58:18.870 --> 00:58:18.880 align:start position:0%
better about it um after you know the
 
00:58:20.870 --> 00:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
conversation and
 
00:58:24.309 --> 00:58:24.319 align:start position:0%
the gentleman who spoke um
 
00:58:24.319 --> 00:58:28.390 align:start position:0%
the gentleman who spoke um
i

00:58:28.390 --> 00:58:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:31.510 --> 00:58:31.520 align:start position:0%
do feel that um
 
00:58:34.829 --> 00:58:34.839 align:start position:0%
representative harvey bola's question
 
00:58:37.990 --> 00:58:38.000 align:start position:0%
about um if it could just be kind of
 
00:58:41.349 --> 00:58:41.359 align:start position:0%
tacked on to what you know they have
 
00:58:44.870 --> 00:58:44.880 align:start position:0%
initially i guess i still question that
 
00:58:48.150 --> 00:58:48.160 align:start position:0%
a little bit um in terms of
 
00:58:51.589 --> 00:58:51.599 align:start position:0%
if they do have that in place is it
 
00:58:55.030 --> 00:58:55.040 align:start position:0%
strictly just the wildlife portion
 
00:58:58.470 --> 00:58:58.480 align:start position:0%
that wasn't contained in it that created
 
00:59:03.510 --> 00:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:06.549 --> 00:59:06.559 align:start position:0%
i think it's i think it
 
00:59:09.190 --> 00:59:09.200 align:start position:0%
it might even be narrower than that uh
 
00:59:10.230 --> 00:59:10.240 align:start position:0%
it's for
 
00:59:12.530 --> 00:59:12.540 align:start position:0%
those animals in this
 
00:59:12.540 --> 00:59:13.670 align:start position:0%
those animals in this
[Music]

00:59:13.670 --> 00:59:13.680 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:59:18.309 --> 00:59:18.319 align:start position:0%
who are that are considered taxons uh
 
00:59:21.270 --> 00:59:21.280 align:start position:0%
basically wildlife and it's it is
 
00:59:23.750 --> 00:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
monitoring for that
 
00:59:27.430 --> 00:59:27.440 align:start position:0%
so any any animal can any mammal can be
 
00:59:27.440 --> 00:59:28.630 align:start position:0%
so any any animal can any mammal can be
attacked

00:59:28.630 --> 00:59:28.640 align:start position:0%
attacked
 
00:59:33.109 --> 00:59:33.119 align:start position:0%
so yes that's those are wild
 
00:59:35.990 --> 00:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
right so it is this is wildlife at least
 
00:59:37.349 --> 00:59:37.359 align:start position:0%
as i read it
 
00:59:38.870 --> 00:59:38.880 align:start position:0%
and and that's something they didn't
 
00:59:40.470 --> 00:59:40.480 align:start position:0%
have in there before
 
00:59:42.870 --> 00:59:42.880 align:start position:0%
and they can't really add it on because
 
00:59:44.470 --> 00:59:44.480 align:start position:0%
it would take too long
 
00:59:49.190 --> 00:59:49.200 align:start position:0%
for them to do that in their rules
 
00:59:51.589 --> 00:59:51.599 align:start position:0%
they can only add things to rules that
 
00:59:53.030 --> 00:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
were a lot that are
 
00:59:57.109 --> 00:59:57.119 align:start position:0%
allowed in statute statutes come first
 
00:59:59.670 --> 00:59:59.680 align:start position:0%
then then you make rules thank you yeah
 
01:00:01.190 --> 01:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
we get mad when they make rules that
 
01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:01.750 align:start position:0%
we get mad when they make rules that
don't

01:00:01.750 --> 01:00:01.760 align:start position:0%
don't
 
01:00:05.430 --> 01:00:05.440 align:start position:0%
that i don't have statute backing
 
01:00:08.789 --> 01:00:08.799 align:start position:0%
okay any anyone else
 
01:00:11.829 --> 01:00:11.839 align:start position:0%
on any poor other portion
 
01:00:15.349 --> 01:00:15.359 align:start position:0%
of the of the bill
 
01:00:19.510 --> 01:00:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:21.829 --> 01:00:21.839 align:start position:0%
so there are no injuries there are no
 
01:00:24.470 --> 01:00:24.480 align:start position:0%
hands raised
 
01:00:27.510 --> 01:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:30.950 --> 01:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
on the on
 
01:00:34.150 --> 01:00:34.160 align:start position:0%
i'll call first i'll call for a a vote
 
01:00:38.710 --> 01:00:38.720 align:start position:0%

01:02:09.270 --> 01:02:09.280 align:start position:0%
now right
 
01:02:11.270 --> 01:02:11.280 align:start position:0%
right you remember yeah we're involved
 
01:02:13.029 --> 01:02:13.039 align:start position:0%

uh i said there's any other
 
01:02:19.190 --> 01:02:19.200 align:start position:0%
discussion on the bill or the amendment
 
01:02:20.309 --> 01:02:20.319 align:start position:0%
oh okay
 
01:02:21.910 --> 01:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
i thought we were just going to vote on
 
01:02:24.390 --> 01:02:24.400 align:start position:0%
the um whether we want to amend it or
 
01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:25.109 align:start position:0%
the um whether we want to amend it or
not

01:02:25.109 --> 01:02:25.119 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:02:27.670 --> 01:02:27.680 align:start position:0%
but there are i think we already did
 
01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:28.630 align:start position:0%
but there are i think we already did
that

01:02:28.630 --> 01:02:28.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:02:30.309 --> 01:02:30.319 align:start position:0%
well we already did that was a straw
 
01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:33.760 align:start position:0%
poll and there would be
 
01:02:36.390 --> 01:02:36.400 align:start position:0%
how about the other aspects of the bill
 
01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:37.109 align:start position:0%
how about the other aspects of the bill
uh

01:02:37.109 --> 01:02:37.119 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:02:39.349 --> 01:02:39.359 align:start position:0%
go if if you have a concern on any
 
01:02:41.270 --> 01:02:41.280 align:start position:0%
portion of the bill
 
01:02:44.230 --> 01:02:44.240 align:start position:0%
now's the time right well i had raised
 
01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:44.710 align:start position:0%
now's the time right well i had raised
quite

01:02:44.710 --> 01:02:44.720 align:start position:0%
quite
 
01:02:47.349 --> 01:02:47.359 align:start position:0%
a hullabaloo about changing the
 
01:02:47.359 --> 01:02:48.069 align:start position:0%
a hullabaloo about changing the
definition

01:02:48.069 --> 01:02:48.079 align:start position:0%
definition
 
01:02:51.109 --> 01:02:51.119 align:start position:0%
of a high tide i was
 
01:02:53.270 --> 01:02:53.280 align:start position:0%
involved in the definition that is
 
01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:54.150 align:start position:0%
involved in the definition that is
currently

01:02:54.150 --> 01:02:54.160 align:start position:0%
currently
 
01:02:58.230 --> 01:02:58.240 align:start position:0%
in in statute i called steve kutcher
 
01:02:58.240 --> 01:02:58.630 align:start position:0%
in in statute i called steve kutcher
from

01:02:58.630 --> 01:02:58.640 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:03:02.150 --> 01:03:02.160 align:start position:0%
the coastal to program
 
01:03:04.789 --> 01:03:04.799 align:start position:0%
to ask him about it i was a little
 
01:03:06.390 --> 01:03:06.400 align:start position:0%
disturbed when i guess
 
01:03:08.630 --> 01:03:08.640 align:start position:0%
senator sherman brought it in and he's
 
01:03:10.710 --> 01:03:10.720 align:start position:0%
had a lot of battles with his
 
01:03:12.950 --> 01:03:12.960 align:start position:0%
shoreline property owners on the beaches
 
01:03:14.870 --> 01:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
about how close they can build to the
 
01:03:17.430 --> 01:03:17.440 align:start position:0%
beach and how
 
01:03:19.750 --> 01:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
where the property line ends where they
 
01:03:23.029 --> 01:03:23.039 align:start position:0%
can forbid people to be on their beach
 
01:03:25.109 --> 01:03:25.119 align:start position:0%
so i i thought that we ought to be
 
01:03:27.589 --> 01:03:27.599 align:start position:0%
looking at the ecological impact
 
01:03:30.470 --> 01:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
also and also the fact that we're
 
01:03:31.829 --> 01:03:31.839 align:start position:0%
expecting to have
 
01:03:34.950 --> 01:03:34.960 align:start position:0%
a sea level rise as senator waters well
 
01:03:37.510 --> 01:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
knows having done that study
 
01:03:41.670 --> 01:03:41.680 align:start position:0%
um and i thought looking at 19 years
 
01:03:42.789 --> 01:03:42.799 align:start position:0%
what starting now
 
01:03:45.829 --> 01:03:45.839 align:start position:0%
in the in the next 19 years we're
 
01:03:47.349 --> 01:03:47.359 align:start position:0%
expecting that
 
01:03:51.029 --> 01:03:51.039 align:start position:0%
lying to move the high water the
 
01:03:54.710 --> 01:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
average over 19 years of the high tide
 
01:03:57.990 --> 01:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
is going to move um
 
01:04:02.150 --> 01:04:02.160 align:start position:0%
so uh i was that whole argument
 
01:04:04.309 --> 01:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
was obviated by the fact that steve
 
01:04:05.510 --> 01:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
kutter said
 
01:04:10.230 --> 01:04:10.240 align:start position:0%
that this change was required by
 
01:04:13.829 --> 01:04:13.839 align:start position:0%
a court order and it wasn't a case about
 
01:04:15.750 --> 01:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
a property owner or anything else
 
01:04:18.870 --> 01:04:18.880 align:start position:0%
it was the particular language
 
01:04:21.270 --> 01:04:21.280 align:start position:0%
that we have in our statute and they
 
01:04:22.069 --> 01:04:22.079 align:start position:0%
said that we
 
01:04:24.789 --> 01:04:24.799 align:start position:0%
must change it according to what this
 
01:04:24.799 --> 01:04:25.270 align:start position:0%
must change it according to what this
bill

01:04:25.270 --> 01:04:25.280 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:04:29.190 --> 01:04:29.200 align:start position:0%
is asking for so so be it
 
01:04:33.190 --> 01:04:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:35.430 --> 01:04:35.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative spang

01:04:48.950 --> 01:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
will i get the amendment number please
 
01:04:49.829 --> 01:04:49.839 align:start position:0%

01:05:01.589 --> 01:05:01.599 align:start position:0%
i've got i have so many papers in front

of me
 
01:05:07.029 --> 01:05:07.039 align:start position:0%
they all look alike so mr chairman can i
 
01:05:08.069 --> 01:05:08.079 align:start position:0%
make a motion to
 
01:05:11.029 --> 01:05:11.039 align:start position:0%
uh ought to pass on the amendment 1573.
 
01:05:11.670 --> 01:05:11.680 align:start position:0%
uh we
 
01:05:13.510 --> 01:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
actually we it's on the we have one
 
01:05:15.750 --> 01:05:15.760 align:start position:0%
already uh
 
01:05:19.910 --> 01:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
this uh
 
01:05:23.029 --> 01:05:23.039 align:start position:0%
motion by uh representative crichton
 
01:05:26.710 --> 01:05:26.720 align:start position:0%
clayton there's a straw
 
01:05:28.710 --> 01:05:28.720 align:start position:0%
a struggle it doesn't count as a vote
 
01:05:30.789 --> 01:05:30.799 align:start position:0%
though does it
 
01:05:34.549 --> 01:05:34.559 align:start position:0%
amendment no pardon i didn't break up
 
01:05:37.750 --> 01:05:37.760 align:start position:0%
the first part of the question
 
01:05:40.789 --> 01:05:40.799 align:start position:0%
doesn't you know i think any any formal
 
01:05:42.230 --> 01:05:42.240 align:start position:0%
vote has to be
 
01:05:45.829 --> 01:05:45.839 align:start position:0%
right this was not about the this was
 
01:05:48.789 --> 01:05:48.799 align:start position:0%
uh was a straw vote on whether or not we
 
01:05:50.309 --> 01:05:50.319 align:start position:0%
would pursue
 
01:05:53.750 --> 01:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
having an amendment uh to remove
 
01:05:58.390 --> 01:05:58.400 align:start position:0%
uh part three of the bill okay and uh
 
01:06:01.910 --> 01:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
we took the struggle and uh if we went
 
01:06:03.430 --> 01:06:03.440 align:start position:0%
ahead and amendment it would it would
 
01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:04.150 align:start position:0%
ahead and amendment it would it would
not

01:06:04.150 --> 01:06:04.160 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:06:05.990 --> 01:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
it would not be passed right then we
 
01:06:09.829 --> 01:06:09.839 align:start position:0%
would need a formal vote right yeah okay
 
01:06:13.349 --> 01:06:13.359 align:start position:0%
uh any other questions on the
 
01:06:15.829 --> 01:06:15.839 align:start position:0%

01:16:30.149 --> 01:16:30.159 align:start position:0%
brought to brought here by uh
 
01:16:33.590 --> 01:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
representative pearl and there was
 
01:16:36.870 --> 01:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
discussion and negotiation with uh
 
01:16:39.910 --> 01:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
renee pelletier about uh
 
01:16:42.470 --> 01:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
during our hearing on what would what
 
01:16:43.750 --> 01:16:43.760 align:start position:0%
would work
 
01:16:47.270 --> 01:16:47.280 align:start position:0%
and uh we came came out with uh
 
01:16:51.590 --> 01:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
uh the the fees would uh would have
 
01:16:52.550 --> 01:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
would kind of cap
 
01:16:55.110 --> 01:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
at with the primitive fees would be no
 
01:16:56.870 --> 01:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
greater than thirty seven
 
01:16:58.790 --> 01:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
hundred and fifty dollars and that was
 
01:17:00.830 --> 01:17:00.840 align:start position:0%
what our bill
 
01:17:05.030 --> 01:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
says and that the and the senate
 
01:17:08.630 --> 01:17:08.640 align:start position:0%
agreed with that but they also tacked on
 
01:17:11.910 --> 01:17:11.920 align:start position:0%
a new paragraph
 
01:17:15.590 --> 01:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
concerning uh the development at uh
 
01:17:19.990 --> 01:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
at p's development uh and i guess that's
 
01:17:24.070 --> 01:17:24.080 align:start position:0%
that's in i think greenland but uh
 
01:17:27.110 --> 01:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
uh where that where the
 
01:17:30.709 --> 01:17:30.719 align:start position:0%
uh they would add to
 
01:17:33.990 --> 01:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
the maximum cash application fee for the
 
01:17:35.669 --> 01:17:35.679 align:start position:0%
peas development authority
 
01:17:38.550 --> 01:17:38.560 align:start position:0%
division of ports and harbors shelby ten
 
01:17:39.669 --> 01:17:39.679 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
01:17:42.550 --> 01:17:42.560 align:start position:0%
per state title peer and docking
 
01:17:45.350 --> 01:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
facility application
 
01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:48.709 align:start position:0%
facility application
uh

01:17:48.709 --> 01:17:48.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:50.950 --> 01:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
i'll tell you where i stand i'm just i
 
01:17:53.110 --> 01:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
would just assume concur
 
01:17:56.310 --> 01:17:56.320 align:start position:0%
because we got all we want they haven't
 
01:17:57.590 --> 01:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
affected what we want
 
01:18:02.390 --> 01:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
and they uh somebody from the coast
 
01:18:07.030 --> 01:18:07.040 align:start position:0%
who has the where the pp's development
 
01:18:09.110 --> 01:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
is i think that's probably senator
 
01:18:09.120 --> 01:18:10.229 align:start position:0%
is i think that's probably senator
sherman

01:18:10.229 --> 01:18:10.239 align:start position:0%
sherman
 
01:18:14.390 --> 01:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
uh probably uh asked for this so
 
01:18:17.510 --> 01:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
i have no problem with it but uh
 
01:18:21.350 --> 01:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
any any thoughts any um any comments
 
01:18:23.270 --> 01:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
from uh
 
01:18:28.790 --> 01:18:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:31.510 --> 01:18:31.520 align:start position:0%
nope sure there are no hands grace so
 
01:18:34.550 --> 01:18:34.560 align:start position:0%
there's no hands raised so i'm going to
 
01:18:38.229 --> 01:18:38.239 align:start position:0%
okay spencer
 
01:18:41.750 --> 01:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh representative smith yeah thank you
 
01:18:42.790 --> 01:18:42.800 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
01:18:45.990 --> 01:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
um i just wanted to say that um
 
01:18:48.709 --> 01:18:48.719 align:start position:0%
because the the part of the bill that we
 
01:18:48.719 --> 01:18:49.830 align:start position:0%
because the the part of the bill that we
passed

01:18:49.830 --> 01:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
passed
 
01:18:52.110 --> 01:18:52.120 align:start position:0%
says no permitting fee greater than
 
01:18:52.120 --> 01:18:54.189 align:start position:0%
says no permitting fee greater than
37.50

01:18:54.189 --> 01:18:54.199 align:start position:0%
37.50
 
01:18:56.630 --> 01:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
3750 and
 
01:18:59.669 --> 01:18:59.679 align:start position:0%
you could say that p's
 
01:19:02.070 --> 01:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
some of those applications with peas
 
01:19:03.189 --> 01:19:03.199 align:start position:0%
could have to do
 
01:19:06.390 --> 01:19:06.400 align:start position:0%
with you know state and federal uh
 
01:19:09.510 --> 01:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
money and so therefore it's kind of
 
01:19:11.669 --> 01:19:11.679 align:start position:0%
upping their ante a little bit because i
 
01:19:13.750 --> 01:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
think title peers and docking may
 
01:19:16.709 --> 01:19:16.719 align:start position:0%
be a lot more complicated and so that
 
01:19:17.590 --> 01:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
lower fee
 
01:19:20.149 --> 01:19:20.159 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be a good idea for them but
 
01:19:22.070 --> 01:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
then also it keeps it from going higher
 
01:19:23.350 --> 01:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
than 10 000.
 
01:19:25.030 --> 01:19:25.040 align:start position:0%
so i think it's a good i it's i think
 
01:19:27.189 --> 01:19:27.199 align:start position:0%
it's reasonable i would say to concur
 
01:19:27.199 --> 01:19:32.229 align:start position:0%
it's reasonable i would say to concur
also

01:19:32.229 --> 01:19:32.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:37.350 --> 01:19:37.360 align:start position:0%
any other replies or responses so sir
 
01:19:39.510 --> 01:19:39.520 align:start position:0%
okay let the records show that the
 
01:19:40.630 --> 01:19:40.640 align:start position:0%
general agreement
 
01:19:43.910 --> 01:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
on the uh on the committee on
 
01:19:46.630 --> 01:19:46.640 align:start position:0%
that we concur that uh send the message
 
01:19:47.510 --> 01:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
of concurrence
 
01:19:53.590 --> 01:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:57.430 --> 01:19:57.440 align:start position:0%
now let's go to house bill
 
01:19:57.440 --> 01:20:02.310 align:start position:0%
now let's go to house bill
99

01:20:02.310 --> 01:20:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:05.030 --> 01:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
and that's a little more complicated
 
01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:05.350 align:start position:0%
and that's a little more complicated
this

01:20:05.350 --> 01:20:05.360 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:20:08.870 --> 01:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
is the bill relative to seasonal
 
01:20:15.189 --> 01:20:15.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:18.310 --> 01:20:18.320 align:start position:0%
go through you know page
 
01:20:21.990 --> 01:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:24.390 --> 01:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
of the side by side there's no no
 
01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:29.030 align:start position:0%
of the side by side there's no no
difference

01:20:29.030 --> 01:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:32.790 --> 01:20:32.800 align:start position:0%
you know the senate version added a
 
01:20:35.910 --> 01:20:35.920 align:start position:0%
little bit of language
 
01:20:39.189 --> 01:20:39.199 align:start position:0%
concerning the uh
 
01:20:45.590 --> 01:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:49.110 --> 01:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
they added ver uh versions that person
 
01:20:52.550 --> 01:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
who this is this is a concerning
 
01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:57.669 align:start position:0%
who this is this is a concerning
uh

01:20:57.669 --> 01:20:57.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:59.590 --> 01:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
any person erecting and installing
 
01:21:01.990 --> 01:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
maintaining or exercising control
 
01:21:05.189 --> 01:21:05.199 align:start position:0%
over an anchored seasonal platform on
 
01:21:06.310 --> 01:21:06.320 align:start position:0%
any public body
 
01:21:09.270 --> 01:21:09.280 align:start position:0%
water shell obtain his or attach his or
 
01:21:09.910 --> 01:21:09.920 align:start position:0%
her name
 
01:21:12.830 --> 01:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
in contact information to any such
 
01:21:14.709 --> 01:21:14.719 align:start position:0%
seasonal platform
 
01:21:18.149 --> 01:21:18.159 align:start position:0%
as provided in this subdivision
 
01:21:20.950 --> 01:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
and in accordance with rules established
 
01:21:22.629 --> 01:21:22.639 align:start position:0%
under rsa
 
01:21:26.229 --> 01:21:26.239 align:start position:0%
2 70
 
01:21:30.950 --> 01:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:33.750 --> 01:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
and that's that's fine at least i think
 
01:21:34.709 --> 01:21:34.719 align:start position:0%
i think it is
 
01:21:38.229 --> 01:21:38.239 align:start position:0%
any any comments on that there's also a
 
01:21:38.239 --> 01:21:38.629 align:start position:0%
any any comments on that there's also a
they

01:21:38.629 --> 01:21:38.639 align:start position:0%

01:21:41.590 --> 01:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
added an additional section that the
 
01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:42.229 align:start position:0%
added an additional section that the
seasonal

01:21:42.229 --> 01:21:42.239 align:start position:0%

engaged in the non-recreational
 
01:22:03.350 --> 01:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
activities may be
 
01:22:05.830 --> 01:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
installed provided the platform meets
 
01:22:08.830 --> 01:22:08.840 align:start position:0%
the minimum requirements established in
 
01:22:08.840 --> 01:22:12.390 align:start position:0%
the minimum requirements established in
270.

01:22:12.390 --> 01:22:12.400 align:start position:0%

01:22:32.950 --> 01:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
uh they're they're
 
01:22:35.830 --> 01:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
they're all they're basically allowing a
 
01:22:38.070 --> 01:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
are they saying that
 
01:22:42.550 --> 01:22:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:50.870 --> 01:22:50.880 align:start position:0%

these there's a they act
 
01:22:55.830 --> 01:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
they've they've added location instead
 
01:22:57.750 --> 01:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
of prohibited
 
01:23:01.430 --> 01:23:01.440 align:start position:0%
and the in the next set of lines the 270
 
01:23:04.070 --> 01:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
anchored seasonal platform prohibited
 
01:23:06.870 --> 01:23:06.880 align:start position:0%
they say change that to location
 
01:23:09.189 --> 01:23:09.199 align:start position:0%
it doesn't i don't get any heartburn to
 
01:23:09.199 --> 01:23:11.669 align:start position:0%
it doesn't i don't get any heartburn to
that

01:23:11.669 --> 01:23:11.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:14.550 --> 01:23:14.560 align:start position:0%
representative smith do you have uh
 
01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:14.950 align:start position:0%
representative smith do you have uh
thanks

01:23:14.950 --> 01:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
01:23:18.830 --> 01:23:18.840 align:start position:0%
mr chair um i was just gonna
 
01:23:21.350 --> 01:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
um clarify a few
 
01:23:24.550 --> 01:23:24.560 align:start position:0%
things um which is uh and
 
01:23:27.990 --> 01:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
on the last page of the side by side uh
 
01:23:31.189 --> 01:23:31.199 align:start position:0%
on their exemptions that the house did
 
01:23:35.390 --> 01:23:35.400 align:start position:0%
exempting um the agencies and the
 
01:23:37.070 --> 01:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
subcontractors doing
 
01:23:38.950 --> 01:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
non-recreational execution of their
 
01:23:40.470 --> 01:23:40.480 align:start position:0%
duties and
 
01:23:42.870 --> 01:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
um in the side by side it says the
 
01:23:44.870 --> 01:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
senate removed these exemptions
 
01:23:47.189 --> 01:23:47.199 align:start position:0%
however actually what they did is they
 
01:23:47.199 --> 01:23:47.990 align:start position:0%
however actually what they did is they
moved

01:23:47.990 --> 01:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
moved
 
01:23:51.590 --> 01:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:55.110 --> 01:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
to section three on page three
 
01:23:57.910 --> 01:23:57.920 align:start position:0%
and says seasonal platforms that support
 
01:23:59.669 --> 01:23:59.679 align:start position:0%
local state or federal government
 
01:24:01.910 --> 01:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
agency subcontractors or conservation
 
01:24:03.990 --> 01:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
groups shall be allowed to
 
01:24:06.709 --> 01:24:06.719 align:start position:0%
do platforms etc so it's kind of in
 
01:24:08.229 --> 01:24:08.239 align:start position:0%
there but they didn't put it in
 
01:24:08.239 --> 01:24:09.270 align:start position:0%
there but they didn't put it in
exemptions

01:24:09.270 --> 01:24:09.280 align:start position:0%
exemptions
 
01:24:12.310 --> 01:24:12.320 align:start position:0%
they put it in what could be allowed and
 
01:24:12.320 --> 01:24:12.709 align:start position:0%
they put it in what could be allowed and
then

01:24:12.709 --> 01:24:12.719 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:24:16.470 --> 01:24:16.480 align:start position:0%
also uh we had pretty much just
 
01:24:20.310 --> 01:24:20.320 align:start position:0%
said uh the person whose um
 
01:24:22.790 --> 01:24:22.800 align:start position:0%
platform is removed has to reimburse the
 
01:24:24.790 --> 01:24:24.800 align:start position:0%
department and the senate went into
 
01:24:27.110 --> 01:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
great detail on how that would happen
 
01:24:29.750 --> 01:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
and how long marine patrol would hold on
 
01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:29.990 align:start position:0%
and how long marine patrol would hold on
to

01:24:29.990 --> 01:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:24:33.189 --> 01:24:33.199 align:start position:0%
the platform and uh so they just
 
01:24:35.270 --> 01:24:35.280 align:start position:0%
made they made it a lot tighter the bill
 
01:24:36.950 --> 01:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
i think so i think it's a
 
01:24:39.669 --> 01:24:39.679 align:start position:0%
i think they made good changes don't
 
01:24:41.510 --> 01:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
always agree with them but
 
01:24:43.990 --> 01:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
in this case i think they did yeah i
 
01:24:45.430 --> 01:24:45.440 align:start position:0%
mean there's nothing in here
 
01:24:47.350 --> 01:24:47.360 align:start position:0%
nothing i see on this bill they've made
 
01:24:48.709 --> 01:24:48.719 align:start position:0%
a lot of changes but
 
01:24:52.390 --> 01:24:52.400 align:start position:0%
they're all either nothing that
 
01:24:55.590 --> 01:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
nothing that i would go to war over uh
 
01:24:57.830 --> 01:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
it's so i'm just going i would just
 
01:24:57.840 --> 01:25:00.390 align:start position:0%
it's so i'm just going i would just
concur

01:25:00.390 --> 01:25:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:01.830 --> 01:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
at least that's where i'm leaving that's
 
01:25:05.990 --> 01:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:09.430 --> 01:25:09.440 align:start position:0%
no other hands up can i
 
01:25:12.870 --> 01:25:12.880 align:start position:0%
i'd concur okay thank you that's uh i
 
01:25:14.149 --> 01:25:14.159 align:start position:0%
think that's what i'm
 
01:25:15.510 --> 01:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
that's where i'm that's where i'm
 
01:25:17.110 --> 01:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
leaning that's where i think i'm gonna
 
01:25:18.229 --> 01:25:18.239 align:start position:0%
be going
 
01:25:21.510 --> 01:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
so uh on
 
01:25:25.189 --> 01:25:25.199 align:start position:0%
with the records show that uh
 
01:25:28.709 --> 01:25:28.719 align:start position:0%
the uh i will be going to
 
01:25:31.830 --> 01:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
i will be going on house bill 99
 
01:25:35.270 --> 01:25:35.280 align:start position:0%
uh i will be
 
01:25:38.709 --> 01:25:38.719 align:start position:0%
is uh i will concur
 
01:25:43.990 --> 01:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
no this is uh just 0.99 or 99.
 
01:25:47.430 --> 01:25:47.440 align:start position:0%
i will i'll be concurring
 
01:25:51.669 --> 01:25:51.679 align:start position:0%
and uh that get the
 
01:25:53.990 --> 01:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
general consensus of the uh we have the
 
01:25:55.350 --> 01:25:55.360 align:start position:0%
consensus of the war
 
01:26:00.470 --> 01:26:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:04.629 --> 01:26:04.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:18.870 --> 01:26:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:22.310 --> 01:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
all right uh comparison of the
 
01:26:27.110 --> 01:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:29.830 --> 01:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
this one this one's going to be a little
 
01:26:32.310 --> 01:26:32.320 align:start position:0%
a little bit different
 
01:26:36.629 --> 01:26:36.639 align:start position:0%
uh 235 was the
 
01:26:39.990 --> 01:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
brown small groundwater withdrawal bill
 
01:26:42.950 --> 01:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
we had passed uh it passed this
 
01:26:44.629 --> 01:26:44.639 align:start position:0%
committee unanimously
 
01:26:47.750 --> 01:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
the year before or the session before it
 
01:26:51.270 --> 01:26:51.280 align:start position:0%
also passed unanimously
 
01:26:55.990 --> 01:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
now this year
 
01:26:58.950 --> 01:26:58.960 align:start position:0%
the exact same bill and they don't they
 
01:27:01.350 --> 01:27:01.360 align:start position:0%
didn't have any problem with it
 
01:27:06.070 --> 01:27:06.080 align:start position:0%
what they did is they tacked on a
 
01:27:09.990 --> 01:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
some revisions to
 
01:27:13.590 --> 01:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
the the
 
01:27:17.110 --> 01:27:17.120 align:start position:0%
pfas fund and programs which is a
 
01:27:20.550 --> 01:27:20.560 align:start position:0%
large multi-million dollar
 
01:27:25.110 --> 01:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
fund concerning uh
 
01:27:28.790 --> 01:27:28.800 align:start position:0%
goods concerning road remediation
 
01:27:31.990 --> 01:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
programs for
 
01:27:36.070 --> 01:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:40.390 --> 01:27:40.400 align:start position:0%
the what has concerned my
 
01:27:44.790 --> 01:27:44.800 align:start position:0%
myself and and others
 
01:27:46.470 --> 01:27:46.480 align:start position:0%
representative smithsmith was in
 
01:27:48.629 --> 01:27:48.639 align:start position:0%
particular having been the former
 
01:27:48.639 --> 01:27:49.510 align:start position:0%
particular having been the former
chairman

01:27:49.510 --> 01:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:27:54.390 --> 01:27:54.400 align:start position:0%
under her uh under her administration
 
01:27:58.550 --> 01:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
there was a bill very similar
 
01:28:02.229 --> 01:28:02.239 align:start position:0%
to uh the
 
01:28:06.790 --> 01:28:06.800 align:start position:0%
almost very similar to the uh
 
01:28:10.229 --> 01:28:10.239 align:start position:0%
the uh well uh the uh excuse me to the
 
01:28:13.030 --> 01:28:13.040 align:start position:0%
the pfast fund there was a house bill
 
01:28:13.590 --> 01:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
but that
 
01:28:18.550 --> 01:28:18.560 align:start position:0%
died of covet and
 
01:28:21.669 --> 01:28:21.679 align:start position:0%
it was very similar to the senate
 
01:28:24.229 --> 01:28:24.239 align:start position:0%
version we said one main difference
 
01:28:28.470 --> 01:28:28.480 align:start position:0%
it did not have anything in it
 
01:28:32.070 --> 01:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
protecting or giving aid
 
01:28:35.750 --> 01:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
to homeowners individual well owners
 
01:28:39.590 --> 01:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:44.390 --> 01:28:44.400 align:start position:0%
so considering this is
 
01:28:46.870 --> 01:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
non-concurring and requesting a
 
01:28:48.550 --> 01:28:48.560 align:start position:0%
committee of conference
 
01:28:51.750 --> 01:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
uh representative smith you want to
 
01:28:53.990 --> 01:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
help me out a little a little bit more
 
01:28:55.910 --> 01:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
on your background and the
 
01:28:59.430 --> 01:28:59.440 align:start position:0%
comments sounds good thanks mr chair um
 
01:29:03.590 --> 01:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
as as jiren zulu said we had a bill
 
01:29:06.629 --> 01:29:06.639 align:start position:0%
that established
 
01:29:10.070 --> 01:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
the pfas remediation fund
 
01:29:12.950 --> 01:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
and it passed resources it passed the
 
01:29:14.709 --> 01:29:14.719 align:start position:0%
house it went to ways and means
 
01:29:17.750 --> 01:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
it passed the house again and then
 
01:29:19.669 --> 01:29:19.679 align:start position:0%
session pretty much closed down for the
 
01:29:21.510 --> 01:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
year and
 
01:29:25.270 --> 01:29:25.280 align:start position:0%
the senate added most of the bill we had
 
01:29:26.310 --> 01:29:26.320 align:start position:0%
passed to an
 
01:29:29.910 --> 01:29:29.920 align:start position:0%
omnibus bill which passed and formed
 
01:29:33.590 --> 01:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
this pfas uh remediation
 
01:29:36.310 --> 01:29:36.320 align:start position:0%
contamination and remediation fund
 
01:29:36.320 --> 01:29:36.950 align:start position:0%
contamination and remediation fund
however

01:29:36.950 --> 01:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:29:40.790 --> 01:29:40.800 align:start position:0%
when we passed the bill out of resources
 
01:29:42.709 --> 01:29:42.719 align:start position:0%
and the house passed it
 
01:29:46.310 --> 01:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
we included municipalities in the people
 
01:29:47.270 --> 01:29:47.280 align:start position:0%
who could apply
 
01:29:50.310 --> 01:29:50.320 align:start position:0%
as well as uh private land
 
01:29:54.070 --> 01:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
private homeowners whose wells had been
 
01:29:56.790 --> 01:29:56.800 align:start position:0%
contaminated by pfas
 
01:29:58.870 --> 01:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
now when the senate put it in their
 
01:30:00.669 --> 01:30:00.679 align:start position:0%
omnibus bill they left out
 
01:30:00.679 --> 01:30:01.910 align:start position:0%
omnibus bill they left out
municipalities

01:30:01.910 --> 01:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
01:30:05.270 --> 01:30:05.280 align:start position:0%
and private well owners
 
01:30:08.550 --> 01:30:08.560 align:start position:0%
and then this year in
 
01:30:10.870 --> 01:30:10.880 align:start position:0%
what they have done to our house bill
 
01:30:10.880 --> 01:30:12.790 align:start position:0%
what they have done to our house bill
235

01:30:12.790 --> 01:30:12.800 align:start position:0%
235
 
01:30:16.470 --> 01:30:16.480 align:start position:0%
which we not only passed and the senate
 
01:30:18.470 --> 01:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
agrees with
 
01:30:21.669 --> 01:30:21.679 align:start position:0%
they also they put
 
01:30:25.510 --> 01:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
they changed the pfas fund
 
01:30:28.070 --> 01:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
to include municipalities but they still
 
01:30:28.080 --> 01:30:29.189 align:start position:0%
to include municipalities but they still
neglected

01:30:29.189 --> 01:30:29.199 align:start position:0%
neglected
 
01:30:31.669 --> 01:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
to address the private wells and how
 
01:30:33.189 --> 01:30:33.199 align:start position:0%
people who have private wells and have
 
01:30:35.750 --> 01:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
been living on bottled water
 
01:30:38.950 --> 01:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
for like two years and
 
01:30:42.629 --> 01:30:42.639 align:start position:0%
still have no no avenue for redress
 
01:30:45.110 --> 01:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
on that issue on getting their water
 
01:30:46.310 --> 01:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
cleaned up
 
01:30:48.149 --> 01:30:48.159 align:start position:0%
we thought it was really important to
 
01:30:50.390 --> 01:30:50.400 align:start position:0%
add that so by having
 
01:30:52.310 --> 01:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
one thing that we would request in a
 
01:30:54.149 --> 01:30:54.159 align:start position:0%
committee a conference was adding
 
01:30:55.669 --> 01:30:55.679 align:start position:0%
private well owners
 
01:30:57.510 --> 01:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
or assuring that by adding
 
01:30:59.110 --> 01:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
municipalities private well
 
01:31:00.470 --> 01:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
owners were going to be covered and
 
01:31:02.790 --> 01:31:02.800 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in the amendment that
 
01:31:04.709 --> 01:31:04.719 align:start position:0%
the senate put on which
 
01:31:07.189 --> 01:31:07.199 align:start position:0%
uh indicates that private well owners
 
01:31:08.790 --> 01:31:08.800 align:start position:0%
would be helped
 
01:31:12.310 --> 01:31:12.320 align:start position:0%
the other um change that the senate made
 
01:31:15.030 --> 01:31:15.040 align:start position:0%
was they changed in the purpose
 
01:31:15.040 --> 01:31:17.030 align:start position:0%
was they changed in the purpose
statement

01:31:17.030 --> 01:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
statement
 
01:31:20.229 --> 01:31:20.239 align:start position:0%
of the pfas remediation fund
 
01:31:23.910 --> 01:31:23.920 align:start position:0%
the words per and polyfloral substances
 
01:31:27.590 --> 01:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
pfas to perfluorochemical contamination
 
01:31:29.990 --> 01:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
and i was very concerned about this
 
01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:30.629 align:start position:0%
and i was very concerned about this
because

01:31:30.629 --> 01:31:30.639 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:31:32.709 --> 01:31:32.719 align:start position:0%
uh we have we already have a bill that
 
01:31:34.390 --> 01:31:34.400 align:start position:0%
we passed this year
 
01:31:37.990 --> 01:31:38.000 align:start position:0%
um that changes the wording from
 
01:31:41.030 --> 01:31:41.040 align:start position:0%
um to
 
01:31:43.510 --> 01:31:43.520 align:start position:0%
per and polyfloral substances rather
 
01:31:44.709 --> 01:31:44.719 align:start position:0%
than just
 
01:31:47.990 --> 01:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
pfas or per floral chemicals
 
01:31:52.229 --> 01:31:52.239 align:start position:0%
so um i reached out to the
 
01:31:55.030 --> 01:31:55.040 align:start position:0%
senate sponsor and also to mike wimsat
 
01:31:56.709 --> 01:31:56.719 align:start position:0%
at des
 
01:32:00.310 --> 01:32:00.320 align:start position:0%
and um mike explained why
 
01:32:03.350 --> 01:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
this language needed to be in and
 
01:32:06.550 --> 01:32:06.560 align:start position:0%
pretty much it will not change how
 
01:32:10.870 --> 01:32:10.880 align:start position:0%
um any the maximum contaminant levels
 
01:32:10.880 --> 01:32:12.310 align:start position:0%
um any the maximum contaminant levels
mcl's

01:32:12.310 --> 01:32:12.320 align:start position:0%
mcl's
 
01:32:15.189 --> 01:32:15.199 align:start position:0%
uh law which we passed last year which
 
01:32:15.199 --> 01:32:15.990 align:start position:0%
uh law which we passed last year which
requires

01:32:15.990 --> 01:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
requires
 
01:32:20.310 --> 01:32:20.320 align:start position:0%
uh pfas it gives makes it clear
 
01:32:23.189 --> 01:32:23.199 align:start position:0%
that uh the amount of pfas that is
 
01:32:25.030 --> 01:32:25.040 align:start position:0%
allowed in drinking water
 
01:32:28.310 --> 01:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
and so it it actually clarifies this
 
01:32:31.350 --> 01:32:31.360 align:start position:0%
so that those mcls will be just
 
01:32:33.430 --> 01:32:33.440 align:start position:0%
you know it won't change anything in how
 
01:32:35.270 --> 01:32:35.280 align:start position:0%
we address that law
 
01:32:37.830 --> 01:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
of the mcl's i know that sounds
 
01:32:38.790 --> 01:32:38.800 align:start position:0%
confusing but
 
01:32:42.550 --> 01:32:42.560 align:start position:0%
um anyway so i would support the
 
01:32:44.870 --> 01:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
the as as of right now unless i hear
 
01:32:46.310 --> 01:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
more in between now and the committee a
 
01:32:46.320 --> 01:32:47.189 align:start position:0%
more in between now and the committee a
conference

01:32:47.189 --> 01:32:47.199 align:start position:0%
conference
 
01:32:49.430 --> 01:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
i would support that part but uh we do
 
01:32:51.990 --> 01:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
have big concerns both chair renzolo and
 
01:32:53.910 --> 01:32:53.920 align:start position:0%
i and probably anyone who was on this
 
01:32:55.270 --> 01:32:55.280 align:start position:0%
committee last year
 
01:32:57.669 --> 01:32:57.679 align:start position:0%
and fought to have private well owners
 
01:32:57.679 --> 01:32:58.709 align:start position:0%
and fought to have private well owners
included

01:32:58.709 --> 01:32:58.719 align:start position:0%
included
 
01:33:01.189 --> 01:33:01.199 align:start position:0%
um would want us to try to get that
 
01:33:03.189 --> 01:33:03.199 align:start position:0%
included in the bill
 
01:33:06.390 --> 01:33:06.400 align:start position:0%
and then the bottom line the
 
01:33:08.870 --> 01:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
the next bottom line is that if we
 
01:33:11.990 --> 01:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
cannot come to agreement with the senate
 
01:33:14.390 --> 01:33:14.400 align:start position:0%
on a in a committee of conference and
 
01:33:15.430 --> 01:33:15.440 align:start position:0%
they won't budge
 
01:33:20.070 --> 01:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
on the private well owners we have saved
 
01:33:23.030 --> 01:33:23.040 align:start position:0%
the small groundwater withdrawals which
 
01:33:25.830 --> 01:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
is the main piece of this bill
 
01:33:28.629 --> 01:33:28.639 align:start position:0%
by putting it in the bill we just passed
 
01:33:32.550 --> 01:33:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:37.510 --> 01:33:37.520 align:start position:0%
that's called politics
 
01:33:40.149 --> 01:33:40.159 align:start position:0%
or belt and suspenders that's right belt
 
01:33:41.350 --> 01:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
and suspenders
 
01:33:43.350 --> 01:33:43.360 align:start position:0%
that represent representative creighton
 
01:33:44.550 --> 01:33:44.560 align:start position:0%
yeah mr chair i just
 
01:33:47.669 --> 01:33:47.679 align:start position:0%
uh from my perspective in
 
01:33:50.550 --> 01:33:50.560 align:start position:0%
in digit 38 i would estimate that less
 
01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:51.590 align:start position:0%
in digit 38 i would estimate that less
than

01:33:51.590 --> 01:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
than
 
01:33:54.790 --> 01:33:54.800 align:start position:0%
40 percent of the people fall under city
 
01:33:56.629 --> 01:33:56.639 align:start position:0%
water of some sort
 
01:33:59.510 --> 01:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
and so the pirates of people are on well
 
01:33:59.520 --> 01:34:01.110 align:start position:0%
and so the pirates of people are on well
water

01:34:01.110 --> 01:34:01.120 align:start position:0%
water
 
01:34:09.830 --> 01:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:13.189 --> 01:34:13.199 align:start position:0%
thank you uh any other uh any other
 
01:34:13.199 --> 01:34:16.310 align:start position:0%
thank you uh any other uh any other
comments

01:34:16.310 --> 01:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:18.550 --> 01:34:18.560 align:start position:0%
representative harvey bowling thank you
 
01:34:19.669 --> 01:34:19.679 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
01:34:22.950 --> 01:34:22.960 align:start position:0%
um i uh of course i'm in favor of
 
01:34:26.629 --> 01:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
helping the private well owner with
 
01:34:28.870 --> 01:34:28.880 align:start position:0%
the terrible circumstance of the key
 
01:34:30.830 --> 01:34:30.840 align:start position:0%
fast contamination in there
 
01:34:33.910 --> 01:34:33.920 align:start position:0%
well um i'm just
 
01:34:36.149 --> 01:34:36.159 align:start position:0%
wondering about the process here because
 
01:34:37.270 --> 01:34:37.280 align:start position:0%
it was my understanding
 
01:34:40.790 --> 01:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
that you know say a homeowner has
 
01:34:44.149 --> 01:34:44.159 align:start position:0%
contamination they should you know act
 
01:34:47.270 --> 01:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
immediately for one um
 
01:34:49.590 --> 01:34:49.600 align:start position:0%
and then this would i thought would
 
01:34:51.510 --> 01:34:51.520 align:start position:0%
incur like a lawsuit
 
01:34:53.350 --> 01:34:53.360 align:start position:0%
okay you've got fast it's obviously not
 
01:34:54.629 --> 01:34:54.639 align:start position:0%
coming from the
 
01:34:57.350 --> 01:34:57.360 align:start position:0%
homeowner uh it's coming from maybe
 
01:34:57.360 --> 01:34:58.790 align:start position:0%
homeowner uh it's coming from maybe
nearby

01:34:58.790 --> 01:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
nearby
 
01:34:58.800 --> 01:35:07.510 align:start position:0%
nearby
station

01:35:07.510 --> 01:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:10.790 --> 01:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
those sort of procedures you know
 
01:35:13.669 --> 01:35:13.679 align:start position:0%
go up to the state hazardous waste a
 
01:35:15.109 --> 01:35:15.119 align:start position:0%
superfund site
 
01:35:17.430 --> 01:35:17.440 align:start position:0%
or a hazardous waste cleaning up site
 
01:35:19.750 --> 01:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
and they sort of handled
 
01:35:22.870 --> 01:35:22.880 align:start position:0%
the monetary part of the cleanup but
 
01:35:26.830 --> 01:35:26.840 align:start position:0%
there was a system of redress to my
 
01:35:26.840 --> 01:35:30.070 align:start position:0%
there was a system of redress to my
knowledge

01:35:30.070 --> 01:35:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:33.270 --> 01:35:33.280 align:start position:0%
mr chair it's really difficult
 
01:35:35.669 --> 01:35:35.679 align:start position:0%
for me anyway to hear the people who are
 
01:35:37.030 --> 01:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
in the room
 
01:35:39.270 --> 01:35:39.280 align:start position:0%
so i get about half of what the last two
 
01:35:40.790 --> 01:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
speakers have said
 
01:35:44.229 --> 01:35:44.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:47.350 --> 01:35:47.360 align:start position:0%
can uh maybe
 
01:35:50.470 --> 01:35:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:52.709 --> 01:35:52.719 align:start position:0%
that's not there representative smith
 
01:35:53.510 --> 01:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
can you hear me
 
01:35:56.149 --> 01:35:56.159 align:start position:0%
now yes now i can hear you find that
 
01:35:57.750 --> 01:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
your microphone is over here
 
01:36:01.030 --> 01:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
um just really quickly i i am in favor
 
01:36:01.510 --> 01:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
of course
 
01:36:03.830 --> 01:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
nobody wants to leave a homeowner with
 
01:36:04.870 --> 01:36:04.880 align:start position:0%
no redress
 
01:36:06.629 --> 01:36:06.639 align:start position:0%
if they have heat fast contamination in
 
01:36:07.990 --> 01:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
their wells
 
01:36:11.030 --> 01:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
um thank you but i i was under the
 
01:36:12.470 --> 01:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
impression that there was already a
 
01:36:13.669 --> 01:36:13.679 align:start position:0%
system in place
 
01:36:16.070 --> 01:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
uh through the state for hazardous waste
 
01:36:17.030 --> 01:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
cleanup is
 
01:36:20.390 --> 01:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
is there not can you speak to how that
 
01:36:23.109 --> 01:36:23.119 align:start position:0%
that they are left out of a process of
 
01:36:25.270 --> 01:36:25.280 align:start position:0%
hazardous waste cleanup in the state
 
01:36:28.070 --> 01:36:28.080 align:start position:0%
thanks we have the drinking and
 
01:36:30.790 --> 01:36:30.800 align:start position:0%
groundwater trust fund
 
01:36:33.990 --> 01:36:34.000 align:start position:0%
and which provides money
 
01:36:37.750 --> 01:36:37.760 align:start position:0%
to municipalities and water systems
 
01:36:43.030 --> 01:36:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:46.870 --> 01:36:46.880 align:start position:0%
loan and grant remediation program would
 
01:36:49.510 --> 01:36:49.520 align:start position:0%
operate within that drinking and
 
01:36:51.750 --> 01:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
groundwater trust fund i believe or they
 
01:36:51.760 --> 01:36:51.990 align:start position:0%
groundwater trust fund i believe or they
would

01:36:51.990 --> 01:36:52.000 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:36:54.950 --> 01:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
be working side by side but there is
 
01:36:54.960 --> 01:36:55.590 align:start position:0%
be working side by side but there is
nothing

01:36:55.590 --> 01:36:55.600 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
01:36:59.990 --> 01:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
in that in either of those
 
01:37:03.109 --> 01:37:03.119 align:start position:0%
that allow a private well owner to
 
01:37:07.189 --> 01:37:07.199 align:start position:0%
ask for remediation funds
 
01:37:09.990 --> 01:37:10.000 align:start position:0%
now one of the arguments against the
 
01:37:11.510 --> 01:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
private well owners
 
01:37:13.109 --> 01:37:13.119 align:start position:0%
applying is because there would be so
 
01:37:14.870 --> 01:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
many people applying it would be all
 
01:37:15.669 --> 01:37:15.679 align:start position:0%
these small
 
01:37:19.550 --> 01:37:19.560 align:start position:0%
individual claims and by adding
 
01:37:19.560 --> 01:37:20.709 align:start position:0%
individual claims and by adding
municipalities

01:37:20.709 --> 01:37:20.719 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
01:37:25.430 --> 01:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:27.750 --> 01:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
there is thought that that could help
 
01:37:29.830 --> 01:37:29.840 align:start position:0%
that situation
 
01:37:31.910 --> 01:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
but i'd like to see it a little more
 
01:37:33.990 --> 01:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
clear rather than oh yeah municipalities
 
01:37:35.830 --> 01:37:35.840 align:start position:0%
can then help the private well owners
 
01:37:36.950 --> 01:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
i'd like it to be more
 
01:37:39.669 --> 01:37:39.679 align:start position:0%
clear that the municipalities would be
 
01:37:39.679 --> 01:37:40.709 align:start position:0%
clear that the municipalities would be
applying

01:37:40.709 --> 01:37:40.719 align:start position:0%
applying
 
01:37:43.030 --> 01:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
on behalf of private well owners to
 
01:37:45.430 --> 01:37:45.440 align:start position:0%
either hook them up to town water
 
01:37:49.430 --> 01:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
or provide filtration systems for them
 
01:37:51.350 --> 01:37:51.360 align:start position:0%
because right now the private well
 
01:37:53.750 --> 01:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
owners as far as i know with the pfas
 
01:37:54.709 --> 01:37:54.719 align:start position:0%
anyway are
 
01:37:57.750 --> 01:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
are left out of the picture as far as
 
01:37:57.760 --> 01:37:58.870 align:start position:0%
are left out of the picture as far as
mtbe

01:37:58.870 --> 01:37:58.880 align:start position:0%
mtbe
 
01:38:02.550 --> 01:38:02.560 align:start position:0%
goes um i don't know if private
 
01:38:05.669 --> 01:38:05.679 align:start position:0%
owners were given remediation
 
01:38:07.669 --> 01:38:07.679 align:start position:0%
on that but i know that right now for
 
01:38:09.189 --> 01:38:09.199 align:start position:0%
pfas uh
 
01:38:12.390 --> 01:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
they are not getting remediation
 
01:38:15.669 --> 01:38:15.679 align:start position:0%
and um and and the
 
01:38:18.950 --> 01:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
pfas uh fund as well as the drinking and
 
01:38:21.189 --> 01:38:21.199 align:start position:0%
groundwater trust fund
 
01:38:24.550 --> 01:38:24.560 align:start position:0%
um are both
 
01:38:28.149 --> 01:38:28.159 align:start position:0%
not where you get 100 you get 25 to 50
 
01:38:30.070 --> 01:38:30.080 align:start position:0%
of the cost and it could be grants or
 
01:38:31.189 --> 01:38:31.199 align:start position:0%
loans and they're
 
01:38:33.750 --> 01:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
in those thumbs are looking for matching
 
01:38:33.760 --> 01:38:34.790 align:start position:0%
in those thumbs are looking for matching
money

01:38:34.790 --> 01:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:38:38.070 --> 01:38:38.080 align:start position:0%
so it's it's it's a very complicated
 
01:38:38.080 --> 01:38:40.310 align:start position:0%
so it's it's it's a very complicated
process

01:38:40.310 --> 01:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:38:43.270 --> 01:38:43.280 align:start position:0%
does that help at all i know it's so
 
01:38:48.550 --> 01:38:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:52.470 --> 01:38:52.480 align:start position:0%
yeah i think uh also that
 
01:38:56.550 --> 01:38:56.560 align:start position:0%

lawsuits uh
 
01:39:10.709 --> 01:39:10.719 align:start position:0%
occurred that that was that
 
01:39:14.229 --> 01:39:14.239 align:start position:0%
fund was uh was populated
 
01:39:18.790 --> 01:39:18.800 align:start position:0%
with money from a loss from a lawsuit
 
01:39:22.149 --> 01:39:22.159 align:start position:0%

and the various towns and that that
money

01:39:29.750 --> 01:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:39:32.870 --> 01:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
is is being used for
 
01:39:36.390 --> 01:39:36.400 align:start position:0%
not not simply for mtbe
 
01:39:40.870 --> 01:39:40.880 align:start position:0%
uh remediation but also for uh
 
01:39:44.070 --> 01:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
other uh capital
 
01:39:47.350 --> 01:39:47.360 align:start position:0%
uh capital water
 
01:39:51.990 --> 01:39:52.000 align:start position:0%
uh water fund water funding um
 
01:39:54.550 --> 01:39:54.560 align:start position:0%
and there will be there's well there's
 
01:39:56.070 --> 01:39:56.080 align:start position:0%
all there is always
 
01:39:59.189 --> 01:39:59.199 align:start position:0%
discussion around the
 
01:40:02.870 --> 01:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
probable lawsuit uh
 
01:40:06.830 --> 01:40:06.840 align:start position:0%
against the manufacturers of the
 
01:40:11.270 --> 01:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
pfast entities and
 
01:40:14.709 --> 01:40:14.719 align:start position:0%
expect expectation is for a a
 
01:40:16.550 --> 01:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
significant settlement
 
01:40:16.560 --> 01:40:16.790 align:start position:0%
significant settlement
so

01:40:16.790 --> 01:40:16.800 align:start position:0%

01:41:13.830 --> 01:41:13.840 align:start position:0%
pretty all pre-written i think you can
 
01:41:15.990 --> 01:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
paste a lot of stuff together
 
01:41:21.030 --> 01:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:24.229 --> 01:41:24.239 align:start position:0%
representative smith for uh do we know
 
01:41:25.910 --> 01:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
if there are any more senate bills
 
01:41:28.229 --> 01:41:28.239 align:start position:0%
coming our way back with changes
 
01:41:31.030 --> 01:41:31.040 align:start position:0%
or are we pretty much finished i have
 
01:41:32.310 --> 01:41:32.320 align:start position:0%
not heard of any more
 
01:41:36.390 --> 01:41:36.400 align:start position:0%

uh and i haven't gotten an alert of any
more

01:41:40.229 --> 01:41:40.239 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:41:43.669 --> 01:41:43.679 align:start position:0%
uh hearings usually the uh the commit
 
01:41:46.070 --> 01:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
the committee assistant does alert me
 
01:41:49.270 --> 01:41:49.280 align:start position:0%
when one of our builds uh is
 
01:41:52.629 --> 01:41:52.639 align:start position:0%
is appearing before our committee and
 
01:41:55.030 --> 01:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
i have not gotten anything since the the
 
01:41:56.229 --> 01:41:56.239 align:start position:0%
last ones
 
01:41:58.830 --> 01:41:58.840 align:start position:0%
okay and secondly anything on retained
 
01:41:58.840 --> 01:42:00.149 align:start position:0%
okay and secondly anything on retained
bills

01:42:00.149 --> 01:42:00.159 align:start position:0%
bills
 
01:42:03.030 --> 01:42:03.040 align:start position:0%
uh we could not touch retained bills
 
01:42:04.310 --> 01:42:04.320 align:start position:0%
until we're finished here
 
01:42:07.510 --> 01:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
so we're now finished here
 
01:42:10.950 --> 01:42:10.960 align:start position:0%
so uh so
 
01:42:14.550 --> 01:42:14.560 align:start position:0%
yeah we should start thinking about them
 
01:42:17.910 --> 01:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
you know but when what we might want to
 
01:42:19.990 --> 01:42:20.000 align:start position:0%
what we might want to talk about on the
 
01:42:21.109 --> 01:42:21.119 align:start position:0%
retain bills
 
01:42:23.990 --> 01:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
we probably should have a work session
 
01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:24.470 align:start position:0%
we probably should have a work session
uh

01:42:24.470 --> 01:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:42:27.510 --> 01:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
i think you and i
 
01:42:30.870 --> 01:42:30.880 align:start position:0%
is as the
 
01:42:33.990 --> 01:42:34.000 align:start position:0%
head as the republican half and the
 
01:42:37.270 --> 01:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
democrat half the committee we will
 
01:42:41.590 --> 01:42:41.600 align:start position:0%
we will discuss a good time to uh
 
01:42:44.870 --> 01:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
have a uh to have retain
 
01:42:47.189 --> 01:42:47.199 align:start position:0%
to some discussion of retained bills
 
01:42:48.470 --> 01:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
realizing we can
 
01:42:51.750 --> 01:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
talk about them we can uh
 
01:42:55.590 --> 01:42:55.600 align:start position:0%
we but we cannot take a vote
 
01:42:59.030 --> 01:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
until sometime in november
 
01:43:02.629 --> 01:43:02.639 align:start position:0%
i think it's uh i think it's
 
01:43:06.070 --> 01:43:06.080 align:start position:0%
the third week in november
 
01:43:12.390 --> 01:43:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:15.669 --> 01:43:15.679 align:start position:0%
but we can you know do do very do
 
01:43:17.750 --> 01:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
various things
 
01:43:20.550 --> 01:43:20.560 align:start position:0%
and we should if unless somebody's
 
01:43:21.430 --> 01:43:21.440 align:start position:0%
taking a
 
01:43:24.470 --> 01:43:24.480 align:start position:0%

thoughts
 
01:43:31.669 --> 01:43:31.679 align:start position:0%
so there's no answers okay uh
 
01:43:34.709 --> 01:43:34.719 align:start position:0%
