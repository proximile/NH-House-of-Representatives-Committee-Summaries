request um business in Claremont that

hit with the frivolous lawsuit by

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:41.640 align:start position:0%
by Governors and followed up by statutes
 
00:08:43.269 --> 00:08:43.279 align:start position:0%
by the
 
00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:46.600 align:start position:0%
legislators um I last night I did a a
 
00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:49.560 align:start position:0%
quick abstract record of what was going
 
00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:55.080 align:start position:0%
on to date and right now there are 48
 
00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
states that have some
 
00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
action um Rel relative to this very
 
00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
subject um uh the District of
 
00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:08.440 align:start position:0%
Columbia and uh only um only three
 
00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:12.760 align:start position:0%
states have taken no action uh for covid
 
00:09:17.389 --> 00:09:17.399 align:start position:0%
U uh imunity of liability that would be
 
00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:20.600 align:start position:0%
Maine Washington and
 
00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:23.360 align:start position:0%
Texas uh and of course New Hampshire
 
00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
would be on that except that we have
 
00:09:29.949 --> 00:09:29.959 align:start position:0%
this bill HP 149 and the Senate also has
 
00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
come up with a similar Bill s
 
00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:36.800 align:start position:0%
sp63 now just briefly my bill differs
 
00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:42.600 align:start position:0%
from s sp63 and that sp63 is specific to
 
00:09:49.069 --> 00:09:49.079 align:start position:0%
covid um whereas my bill um is targeted
 
00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:54.680 align:start position:0%
for any um Health Emergency by declared
 
00:09:58.190 --> 00:09:58.200 align:start position:0%
by uh the New Hampshire legislature or
 
00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:01.880 align:start position:0%
the governor similar to what we have now
 
00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:04.600 align:start position:0%
and that way uh we're not uh just
 
00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:08.320 align:start position:0%
limited to the current covid
 
00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
situation I'm thinking that we may have
 
00:10:13.509 --> 00:10:13.519 align:start position:0%
more of these down the road in the
 
00:10:17.949 --> 00:10:17.959 align:start position:0%
future either variations of covid um
 
00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:20.480 align:start position:0%
that we're we're being talked about now
 
00:10:24.269 --> 00:10:24.279 align:start position:0%
and or some other new threat um that we
 
00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
have to deal with on a state basis and
 
00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
or nationally so I was trying to get the
 
00:10:34.829 --> 00:10:34.839 align:start position:0%
maximum mileage out of uh my bill by
 
00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:37.800 align:start position:0%
making it a little more applicable on a
 
00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:39.720 align:start position:0%
National Emergency
 
00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
basis um relative to the other
 
00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
states uh there were about 19 of
 
00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:53.200 align:start position:0%
them that restricted their liability
 
00:10:56.829 --> 00:10:56.839 align:start position:0%
immunity to spec to specifically
 
00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:00.360 align:start position:0%
covid and specifically to Health Care
 
00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:03.240 align:start position:0%
Facilities workers professions
 
00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:05.240 align:start position:0%
volunteers and so
 
00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:10.200 align:start position:0%
forth the remainder um are more
 
00:11:13.629 --> 00:11:13.639 align:start position:0%
encompassing with um the immunity
 
00:11:17.389 --> 00:11:17.399 align:start position:0%
extended to businesses persons
 
00:11:20.949 --> 00:11:20.959 align:start position:0%
entities um as well as Health Care
 
00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
Professionals businesses uh facilities
 
00:11:24.949 --> 00:11:24.959 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:28.480 align:start position:0%
forth the common theme among all of them
 
00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:32.360 align:start position:0%
is the good faith principle which we've
 
00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:35.680 align:start position:0%
adopted in this bill that if a
 
00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:39.560 align:start position:0%
businessperson entity acts in good faith
 
00:11:43.829 --> 00:11:43.839 align:start position:0%
to observe the orders statutes
 
00:11:47.829 --> 00:11:47.839 align:start position:0%
directives uh of U the state the health
 
00:11:47.839 --> 00:11:49.509 align:start position:0%
directives uh of U the state the health
department

00:11:49.509 --> 00:11:49.519 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:11:49.519 --> 00:11:51.509 align:start position:0%
department
CDC

00:11:51.509 --> 00:11:51.519 align:start position:0%
CDC
 
00:11:53.389 --> 00:11:53.399 align:start position:0%
um the
 
00:11:57.310 --> 00:11:57.320 align:start position:0%
uh the general guidelines of of other
 
00:11:59.470 --> 00:11:59.480 align:start position:0%
applicable agencies then
 
00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:03.160 align:start position:0%
they're afforded uh the presumption of
 
00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:06.440 align:start position:0%
uh limited liability and Immunity to
 
00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:09.320 align:start position:0%
that and this is not unlike what we
 
00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:12.720 align:start position:0%
already have in the statute at
 
00:12:18.269 --> 00:12:18.279 align:start position:0%
508 um we have about a dozen limited
 
00:12:18.279 --> 00:12:19.949 align:start position:0%
508 um we have about a dozen limited
liability

00:12:19.949 --> 00:12:19.959 align:start position:0%
liability
 
00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
immunities um not unlike uh one of my
 
00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:26.120 align:start position:0%
favorites is for instance the
 
00:12:30.269 --> 00:12:30.279 align:start position:0%
landowner presumption of um Li um
 
00:12:33.949 --> 00:12:33.959 align:start position:0%
immunity when um they open up their land
 
00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
to public use for
 
00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
trail uh without fee and they're immune
 
00:12:43.389 --> 00:12:43.399 align:start position:0%
from liability except if they do
 
00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:47.000 align:start position:0%
something that's un unsafe or
 
00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:49.320 align:start position:0%
intentionally malicious so on and so
 
00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
forth 508 colon representative stap I
 
00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
want to cut you short but U we have a
 
00:12:57.550 --> 00:12:57.560 align:start position:0%
lot of people who have signed up to
 
00:12:59.389 --> 00:12:59.399 align:start position:0%
speak so if you could kind of wrap up it
 
00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
would be appreciated yes sir um um and
 
00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
so um I just wanted to draw attention to
 
00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:10.120 align:start position:0%
that that we already have uh U the
 
00:13:11.949 --> 00:13:11.959 align:start position:0%
liability uh
 
00:13:16.069 --> 00:13:16.079 align:start position:0%
immunities um that uh are CH can be
 
00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:21.480 align:start position:0%
challenged um if there is other than uh
 
00:13:24.629 --> 00:13:24.639 align:start position:0%
faithful good faith efforts to observe
 
00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
uh and keep the public safe at their
 
00:13:29.829 --> 00:13:29.839 align:start position:0%
establishment or at their premis
 
00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:33.560 align:start position:0%
so um with that I'll conclude um and and
 
00:13:36.949 --> 00:13:36.959 align:start position:0%
leave time open for questions thank you
 
00:13:39.389 --> 00:13:39.399 align:start position:0%
thank thank you for your testimony uh
 
00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:42.680 align:start position:0%
representative uh first of all before uh
 
00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:44.240 align:start position:0%
we do have some people with questions
 
00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:46.040 align:start position:0%
but I just note to everybody that we
 
00:13:48.269 --> 00:13:48.279 align:start position:0%
have 10 people who have signed up to
 
00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:51.680 align:start position:0%
speak uh and and and I see another hand
 
00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:53.680 align:start position:0%
up in addition to that so I am going to
 
00:13:55.389 --> 00:13:55.399 align:start position:0%
limit the testimony at this point in
 
00:13:58.150 --> 00:13:58.160 align:start position:0%
time to for other speakers to to uh
 
00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:00.240 align:start position:0%
three minutes uh going
 
00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:02.600 align:start position:0%
forward and representa Moran did you
 
00:14:03.829 --> 00:14:03.839 align:start position:0%
have a question for representative
 
00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
Stapleton oh sure yes um anytime anytime
 
00:14:11.269 --> 00:14:11.279 align:start position:0%
through the court systems or any or
 
00:14:12.829 --> 00:14:12.839 align:start position:0%
anywhere else when you provide a venue
 
00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:14.440 align:start position:0%
where people can seek you know redress
 
00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
for damages or that some people people
 
00:14:19.749 --> 00:14:19.759 align:start position:0%
are going to take advantage of and that
 
00:14:23.949 --> 00:14:23.959 align:start position:0%
may not always be unfol but you so I'm
 
00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:27.160 align:start position:0%
not sure um and there already is course
 
00:14:29.069 --> 00:14:29.079 align:start position:0%
there already course are some protect
 
00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:31.120 align:start position:0%
sort protections for people who are
 
00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
filing frivolous lawsuits and or against
 
00:14:35.069 --> 00:14:35.079 align:start position:0%
people who aren't aren't acting in good
 
00:14:36.749 --> 00:14:36.759 align:start position:0%
facei so
 
00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
do and of course it um I did notice that
 
00:14:41.509 --> 00:14:41.519 align:start position:0%
Texas was one of the states which
 
00:14:43.389 --> 00:14:43.399 align:start position:0%
doesn't do it which of course is the
 
00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
state that recently lifted its mass
 
00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
mandate and but um so you have any
 
00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:50.560 align:start position:0%
examples of any lawsuits privilege or
 
00:14:53.629 --> 00:14:53.639 align:start position:0%
not that have in fact been U filed for
 
00:14:55.509 --> 00:14:55.519 align:start position:0%
that would be that could potentially be
 
00:14:57.550 --> 00:14:57.560 align:start position:0%
affected by this law I mean are there
 
00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
any lawsuits here in hampire or even
 
00:15:03.069 --> 00:15:03.079 align:start position:0%
elsewhere that you know of um where
 
00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:06.320 align:start position:0%
they've been suing people because of um
 
00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:07.800 align:start position:0%
because of
 
00:15:10.269 --> 00:15:10.279 align:start position:0%
covid thank you for the question
 
00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:12.720 align:start position:0%
representative Oregon um and that is a
 
00:15:15.189 --> 00:15:15.199 align:start position:0%
good question um I have to say I'm sorry
 
00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
that I have had not had time to
 
00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:19.240 align:start position:0%
investigate that that would have been a
 
00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
logical followup prior to my coming here
 
00:15:25.189 --> 00:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
but I I have not been able to do that so
 
00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:27.560 align:start position:0%
I'm not aware to what extent lawsuits
 
00:15:31.269 --> 00:15:31.279 align:start position:0%
have been filed in any of the 48 states
 
00:15:33.269 --> 00:15:33.279 align:start position:0%
and District of
 
00:15:35.629 --> 00:15:35.639 align:start position:0%
Columbia representa
 
00:15:39.509 --> 00:15:39.519 align:start position:0%
bir do you have a question thank you um
 
00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:41.800 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative for taking
 
00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
my question um first of all uh is it not
 
00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:50.360 align:start position:0%
true that we already have in the law uh
 
00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:54.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:58.670 --> 00:15:58.680 align:start position:0%
lawsuits uh yes I'm sure that uh we we
 
00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:01.480 align:start position:0%
have more than adequate statuto
 
00:16:05.629 --> 00:16:05.639 align:start position:0%
Authority for dealing with these things
 
00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:08.680 align:start position:0%
but we felt that um because of the
 
00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
special nature um of of the covid uh
 
00:16:16.069 --> 00:16:16.079 align:start position:0%
pandemic and the possibility of um
 
00:16:19.189 --> 00:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
lawsuits arising out of that that might
 
00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
be frivolous or baseless that we needed
 
00:16:25.309 --> 00:16:25.319 align:start position:0%
some protection and and I think it Bears
 
00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
out that concern is valid by virtue of
 
00:16:29.269 --> 00:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
the 40
 
00:16:31.269 --> 00:16:31.279 align:start position:0%
states that have enacted Governor's
 
00:16:34.509 --> 00:16:34.519 align:start position:0%
proclamations statutory emergency orders
 
00:16:40.189 --> 00:16:40.199 align:start position:0%
and so forth um so um yeah it's not
 
00:16:42.829 --> 00:16:42.839 align:start position:0%
operating to the exclusion of those
 
00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
other um statutes or orders but in
 
00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:46.629 align:start position:0%
other um statutes or orders but in
addition

00:16:46.629 --> 00:16:46.639 align:start position:0%
addition
 
00:16:49.269 --> 00:16:49.279 align:start position:0%
to if I could follow up with just a very
 
00:16:51.389 --> 00:16:51.399 align:start position:0%
quick question go ahead uh
 
00:16:53.389 --> 00:16:53.399 align:start position:0%
representative you seem very numbers
 
00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
oriented I'm wondering if you have the
 
00:17:00.829 --> 00:17:00.839 align:start position:0%
number of states that have passed
 
00:17:03.909 --> 00:17:03.919 align:start position:0%
legislation uh roughly equivalent to
 
00:17:09.429 --> 00:17:09.439 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:14.549 --> 00:17:14.559 align:start position:0%
legislation I use principally U several
 
00:17:17.789 --> 00:17:17.799 align:start position:0%
of the states language that came very s
 
00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
similar to each other in um the
 
00:17:25.590 --> 00:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
observance of some good faith efforts to
 
00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
comply with directives executive order
 
00:17:31.909 --> 00:17:31.919 align:start position:0%
statutes CDC directives and so
 
00:17:31.919 --> 00:17:33.549 align:start position:0%
statutes CDC directives and so
forth

00:17:33.549 --> 00:17:33.559 align:start position:0%
forth
 
00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:37.360 align:start position:0%
um but beyond that it's all over the
 
00:17:40.549 --> 00:17:40.559 align:start position:0%
board um with regard to who was covered
 
00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
that's the major variance is the
 
00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
entities that are covered in all of
 
00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:47.480 align:start position:0%
those 48 different
 
00:17:51.029 --> 00:17:51.039 align:start position:0%
states but the common theme was um that
 
00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
people acted in good faith without
 
00:17:57.070 --> 00:17:57.080 align:start position:0%
malice and without wanting disregard
 
00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:01.000 align:start position:0%
that uh they would be afforded a
 
00:18:02.789 --> 00:18:02.799 align:start position:0%
rebuttable uh
 
00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:12.669 --> 00:18:12.679 align:start position:0%
uh your question thank you represent
 
00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:14.760 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander did you have a
 
00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
question um thank you Mr chair thank you
 
00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question um
 
00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:20.440 align:start position:0%
my my question is primarily around
 
00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:22.360 align:start position:0%
section one of the bill lines 10 through
 
00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:26.120 align:start position:0%
16 um I guess so it says like there's an
 
00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:28.480 align:start position:0%
immunity for actual or alleged injury or
 
00:18:30.669 --> 00:18:30.679 align:start position:0%
infection or exposure resulting from a
 
00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:33.240 align:start position:0%
declared health health emergency but
 
00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:34.880 align:start position:0%
then it says the immunity shall not to
 
00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
apply in the case of willful negligence
 
00:18:39.549 --> 00:18:39.559 align:start position:0%
wanting disregard or malicious or
 
00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:41.400 align:start position:0%
intentional misconduct there's an
 
00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
argument to be made that um you know not
 
00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:46.400 align:start position:0%
wearing a mask whether it is you know
 
00:18:48.549 --> 00:18:48.559 align:start position:0%
mandated by the governor or not would be
 
00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:50.600 align:start position:0%
would qualify as a want and disregard or
 
00:18:53.029 --> 00:18:53.039 align:start position:0%
malicious or um intentional misconduct I
 
00:18:56.909 --> 00:18:56.919 align:start position:0%
guess I'm wondering um is there like an
 
00:18:58.950 --> 00:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
example of you know
 
00:19:00.669 --> 00:19:00.679 align:start position:0%
how this bill would you know further
 
00:19:03.149 --> 00:19:03.159 align:start position:0%
protect people like that or or would do
 
00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
something that isn't already covered in
 
00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:08.320 align:start position:0%
statute well thank you for the question
 
00:19:11.029 --> 00:19:11.039 align:start position:0%
that that is a good question because um
 
00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
with regard to masks for instance the
 
00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:17.360 align:start position:0%
jury seems to still be out in various
 
00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:20.320 align:start position:0%
Circles of thought and even science um
 
00:19:21.909 --> 00:19:21.919 align:start position:0%
there are some of course that say that
 
00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:24.320 align:start position:0%
the mass can actually be harmful under
 
00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:26.960 align:start position:0%
circumstances others say it's mandatory
 
00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:30.720 align:start position:0%
to guard yourself other people
 
00:19:33.549 --> 00:19:33.559 align:start position:0%
um you know the devil's in the details
 
00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:36.640 align:start position:0%
but we could not address every possible
 
00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
recommendation or circumstance uh
 
00:19:42.669 --> 00:19:42.679 align:start position:0%
relative to PPE in the bill and none of
 
00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:45.880 align:start position:0%
the states do that that have enacted
 
00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:49.000 align:start position:0%
this type of legislation or executive
 
00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:52.120 align:start position:0%
orders they've left it up basically to
 
00:19:54.669 --> 00:19:54.679 align:start position:0%
uh the states the CDC the health
 
00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:57.360 align:start position:0%
departments those experts and scientists
 
00:19:59.909 --> 00:19:59.919 align:start position:0%
that can make the prescription
 
00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
best thank you representative mlan yeah
 
00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:05.880 align:start position:0%
thank you um so we are press for time so
 
00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
we just give me a concise answer on this
 
00:20:10.909 --> 00:20:10.919 align:start position:0%
one I'm just because this is not a
 
00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:12.640 align:start position:0%
blanket immunity because it's a
 
00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
qualified immunity of sorts there has to
 
00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:18.640 align:start position:0%
be a violation of good faith in practice
 
00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
how would this work who would determine
 
00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:23.440 align:start position:0%
whether or not it was good faith without
 
00:20:26.549 --> 00:20:26.559 align:start position:0%
first uh going to court so how how would
 
00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:30.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:34.789 --> 00:20:34.799 align:start position:0%
I I would suppose that um a lawsuit is
 
00:20:37.909 --> 00:20:37.919 align:start position:0%
brought and it would have to appear to
 
00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
uh to the court to make that judgment
 
00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:43.640 align:start position:0%
and the motion by attorneys uh to
 
00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:46.120 align:start position:0%
dismiss based on the
 
00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:49.240 align:start position:0%
statute or to proceed based on the
 
00:20:51.390 --> 00:20:51.400 align:start position:0%
evidence that there was a lack of good
 
00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
faith U proper regard for uh the the
 
00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:58.990 align:start position:0%
faith U proper regard for uh the the
recommendations

00:20:58.990 --> 00:20:59.000 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
00:21:00.909 --> 00:21:00.919 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any other questions
 
00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
for representative
 
00:21:04.789 --> 00:21:04.799 align:start position:0%
stapon see none thank you for your
 
00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
testimony today thank

you uh the next speaker will be also a
 
00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:14.360 align:start position:0%

baldasaro um thank you Mr chairman U for
 
00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:19.320 align:start position:0%
the record representative Al Bal DeSaro
 
00:21:22.669 --> 00:21:22.679 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County District 5 London der
 
00:21:25.269 --> 00:21:25.279 align:start position:0%
I'm here in an undisclosed location and
 
00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:28.240 align:start position:0%
my wife is in the house but anyways I'm
 
00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:30.400 align:start position:0%
be real quick um this is a protection
 
00:21:33.669 --> 00:21:33.679 align:start position:0%
bill and it's being proactive um we know
 
00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:35.200 align:start position:0%
what's on the books about frivolous
 
00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:37.400 align:start position:0%
lawsuits and other things but the bottom
 
00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
line is it's costing businesses it could
 
00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:42.080 align:start position:0%
cost business money right up front in
 
00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
lawyer feeds and then it's only my
 
00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:46.360 align:start position:0%
understanding of the bill is only for
 
00:21:48.549 --> 00:21:48.559 align:start position:0%
the covid um you know it wouldn't
 
00:21:50.149 --> 00:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
protect it we already protect those
 
00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:53.000 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical companies that are giving
 
00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
um shots vaccines to people they have
 
00:21:58.470 --> 00:21:58.480 align:start position:0%
immunity so why shouldn't we be be
 
00:22:00.669 --> 00:22:00.679 align:start position:0%
proactive in protecting our businesses
 
00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:02.880 align:start position:0%

padra thank you Mr chair uh for the
 
00:22:28.269 --> 00:22:28.279 align:start position:0%
record my name is Israel Pedra I
 
00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:30.360 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro District 9 um which is
 
00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
Manchester Ward 2 and I am speaking
 
00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
today in opposition to this bill um by
 
00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
way of disclosure I I I am a practicing
 
00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:41.080 align:start position:0%
attorney as many of you know I represent
 
00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
uh both plaintiffs and defendants in a
 
00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:45.720 align:start position:0%
variety of litigation matters including
 
00:22:49.269 --> 00:22:49.279 align:start position:0%
injury matters um there there's a couple
 
00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:52.200 align:start position:0%
problems with this bill um the first
 
00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:56.480 align:start position:0%
being that um it immunizes negligence
 
00:22:58.190 --> 00:22:58.200 align:start position:0%
and that's kind of my biggest objection
 
00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:01.640 align:start position:0%
to it and I to the extent this committee
 
00:23:04.909 --> 00:23:04.919 align:start position:0%
continues to hear bills that attempt to
 
00:23:07.149 --> 00:23:07.159 align:start position:0%
um protect for profit businesses from
 
00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
the consequences of their own negligence
 
00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
I will continue to testify in opposition
 
00:23:14.350 --> 00:23:14.360 align:start position:0%
to them um simply put this bill will
 
00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:16.760 align:start position:0%
would allow negligent businesses which
 
00:23:19.029 --> 00:23:19.039 align:start position:0%
negligently injure their customers to
 
00:23:19.039 --> 00:23:20.350 align:start position:0%
negligently injure their customers to
avoid

00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:20.360 align:start position:0%
avoid
 
00:23:23.269 --> 00:23:23.279 align:start position:0%
repercussions um under current law I
 
00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:24.640 align:start position:0%
think it's important to point out a
 
00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:26.120 align:start position:0%
business is only going to be legally
 
00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:28.600 align:start position:0%
liable if they are negligent that's the
 
00:23:31.149 --> 00:23:31.159 align:start position:0%
current law that's that's how uh the law
 
00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:33.640 align:start position:0%
of torts Works you're not liable someone
 
00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:35.400 align:start position:0%
gets covid on your property you're not
 
00:23:37.029 --> 00:23:37.039 align:start position:0%
liable just because one of your
 
00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:39.080 align:start position:0%
employees gives covid to one of your
 
00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
customers you're only liable if you were
 
00:23:44.269 --> 00:23:44.279 align:start position:0%
negligent and it is proved that you
 
00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
caused injury due to your
 
00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:48.520 align:start position:0%
negligence um so there's no statute
 
00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
that's necessary to protect a business
 
00:23:52.510 --> 00:23:52.520 align:start position:0%
from non-negligent
 
00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:55.200 align:start position:0%
behavior um I think it's important to
 
00:24:00.269 --> 00:24:00.279 align:start position:0%
point out uh that to my knowledge and to
 
00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:02.120 align:start position:0%
my understanding from to others knowledg
 
00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
is that there have been no such lawsuits
 
00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:06.720 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire relating to covid
 
00:24:09.149 --> 00:24:09.159 align:start position:0%
injuries um I'm not aware of a single
 
00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
one National organizations track this
 
00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:13.360 align:start position:0%
kind of thing and they're not aware of
 
00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
any such lawsuit in New Hampshire um so
 
00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
really this is a solution in search of a
 
00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:23.200 align:start position:0%
problem um and in that regard I mean the
 
00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
entire purpose of our justice system is
 
00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:27.200 align:start position:0%
that folks get to bring their claims
 
00:24:28.909 --> 00:24:28.919 align:start position:0%
into court and a jury of New Hampshire
 
00:24:31.029 --> 00:24:31.039 align:start position:0%
citizens decide whether that claim is
 
00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:33.200 align:start position:0%
valid that's what's been done for
 
00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:34.240 align:start position:0%
hundreds of
 
00:24:36.789 --> 00:24:36.799 align:start position:0%
years um I think the bill the second
 
00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
issue with the bill is its language and
 
00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:42.360 align:start position:0%
it um the structure of it frankly it's
 
00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:46.440 align:start position:0%
very vague um it applies to um uncertain
 
00:24:48.909 --> 00:24:48.919 align:start position:0%
things in the future first of all it
 
00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:52.440 align:start position:0%
also talks about uh willful negligence
 
00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
which in in my mind is kind of a
 
00:24:57.990 --> 00:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
oxymoron and not really a appropriate
 
00:25:02.029 --> 00:25:02.039 align:start position:0%
term for for for a bill negligence as
 
00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
many of you know is by definition
 
00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
something that's an accident um willful
 
00:25:11.029 --> 00:25:11.039 align:start position:0%
on the other hand implies intent so to
 
00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:12.880 align:start position:0%
the extent the the bill talks about
 
00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:13.830 align:start position:0%
the extent the the bill talks about
willful

00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
willful
 
00:25:16.029 --> 00:25:16.039 align:start position:0%
negligence um it doesn't necessarily
 
00:25:18.029 --> 00:25:18.039 align:start position:0%
mean what you think it means uh I I
 
00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
believe it would be interpreted as
 
00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
someone uh intentionally injuring
 
00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:26.720 align:start position:0%
someone else uh due to due to covid or
 
00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:29.000 align:start position:0%
causing spread of Co intentionally
 
00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
essentially um
 
00:25:34.149 --> 00:25:34.159 align:start position:0%
so the the the language of the bill is I
 
00:25:36.269 --> 00:25:36.279 align:start position:0%
think too imprecise um to really be
 
00:25:39.149 --> 00:25:39.159 align:start position:0%
workable I think as as uh a Committee
 
00:25:41.149 --> 00:25:41.159 align:start position:0%
Member pointed out the language is also
 
00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
vague enough that um whether a business
 
00:25:46.590 --> 00:25:46.600 align:start position:0%
actually complies in good faith or with
 
00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
government regulations is not actually
 
00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
something that is going to be decidable
 
00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
by a judge that's a question that a jury
 
00:25:55.269 --> 00:25:55.279 align:start position:0%
is ultimately going to decide if there's
 
00:25:59.430 --> 00:25:59.440 align:start position:0%
any centella of evidence um um you know
 
00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
in favor of the plaintiff so to the
 
00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:04.000 align:start position:0%
extent that this bill is designed to
 
00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:06.360 align:start position:0%
prevent lawsuits from coming in the door
 
00:26:08.269 --> 00:26:08.279 align:start position:0%
from going to a jury it's not going to
 
00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:10.880 align:start position:0%
succeed um because ultimately whether
 
00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
the language of the statute has been
 
00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:14.240 align:start position:0%
complied with is going to be a question
 
00:26:17.669 --> 00:26:17.679 align:start position:0%
for the jury so in my opinion just to
 
00:26:20.029 --> 00:26:20.039 align:start position:0%
conclude yeah if you could just wrap up
 
00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
please I I I will wrap up yep just just
 
00:26:25.789 --> 00:26:25.799 align:start position:0%
in my opinion to to conclude I think
 
00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:27.880 align:start position:0%
that this is a bill that seeks to have
 
00:26:30.190 --> 00:26:30.200 align:start position:0%
the legislature dictate who gets access
 
00:26:32.190 --> 00:26:32.200 align:start position:0%
to the courthouse I think it's
 
00:26:34.269 --> 00:26:34.279 align:start position:0%
paternalistic it's activist it's
 
00:26:37.029 --> 00:26:37.039 align:start position:0%
unnecessary most of all okay um so thank
 
00:26:39.669 --> 00:26:39.679 align:start position:0%
you very much for for your for your time
 
00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Soviet did you
 
00:26:44.389 --> 00:26:44.399 align:start position:0%
have a question for representative P yes
 
00:26:45.789 --> 00:26:45.799 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:26:48.549 --> 00:26:48.559 align:start position:0%
taking my question just a brief one uh
 
00:26:52.669 --> 00:26:52.679 align:start position:0%
with the spread of a virus like we have
 
00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
here uh what are the chances you could
 
00:26:58.149 --> 00:26:58.159 align:start position:0%
possibly track down where you got it
 
00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
from as as a lawyer bringing a suit um
 
00:27:02.990 --> 00:27:03.000 align:start position:0%
what's the difficulty involved
 
00:27:05.269 --> 00:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
there I thank you representative for
 
00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
your question I think that's a very
 
00:27:07.870 --> 00:27:07.880 align:start position:0%
important Point thank you for bringing
 
00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:10.840 align:start position:0%
it up um and that you're precisely right
 
00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:12.760 align:start position:0%
being able to track where a covid
 
00:27:15.310 --> 00:27:15.320 align:start position:0%
infection was incurred I think would be
 
00:27:18.389 --> 00:27:18.399 align:start position:0%
extremely and prohibitively difficult
 
00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
and that's the exact reason why we
 
00:27:22.909 --> 00:27:22.919 align:start position:0%
haven't seen covid related lawsuits in
 
00:27:24.909 --> 00:27:24.919 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and we likely won't see
 
00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:27.200 align:start position:0%
them it's because under a neg regular
 
00:27:30.389 --> 00:27:30.399 align:start position:0%
neg claim under the current law not you
 
00:27:33.149 --> 00:27:33.159 align:start position:0%
need to show that your injury was caused
 
00:27:35.590 --> 00:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
by the defendant and part of that cause
 
00:27:38.789 --> 00:27:38.799 align:start position:0%
is showing that you contracted the
 
00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
infection um more likely than not from
 
00:27:44.470 --> 00:27:44.480 align:start position:0%
that Source I think that's next to
 
00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:46.120 align:start position:0%
impossible to prove under current law
 
00:27:48.430 --> 00:27:48.440 align:start position:0%
and another reason why we don't need
 
00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:51.440 align:start position:0%
this thank you thank you any other
 
00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
questions for representative
 
00:27:56.590 --> 00:27:56.600 align:start position:0%
P see none thank you for your testimony
 
00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:58.710 align:start position:0%
P see none thank you for your testimony
today

00:27:58.710 --> 00:27:58.720 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:28:07.029 --> 00:28:07.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
Creer hi thank you for letting me speak
 
00:28:11.710 --> 00:28:11.720 align:start position:0%
today um my name is David career I am
 
00:28:13.310 --> 00:28:13.320 align:start position:0%
director of public policy for the
 
00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:15.440 align:start position:0%
business and industry Association of New
 
00:28:18.190 --> 00:28:18.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh we are very supportive of
 
00:28:20.549 --> 00:28:20.559 align:start position:0%
this bill as well as the other ones um
 
00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:23.440 align:start position:0%
that have been mentioned prior to this
 
00:28:26.389 --> 00:28:26.399 align:start position:0%
um so one of the top issues among our
 
00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:28.320 align:start position:0%
businesses is this Safe Harbor
 
00:28:30.430 --> 00:28:30.440 align:start position:0%
protections uh they are afraid that
 
00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
while they're operating during the
 
00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
pandemic they will face lawsuits uh from
 
00:28:35.509 --> 00:28:35.519 align:start position:0%
people claiming they've contracted
 
00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:38.720 align:start position:0%
covid-19 at that business um and these
 
00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
cases you know has already been implied
 
00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
have going to be very difficult to
 
00:28:45.149 --> 00:28:45.159 align:start position:0%
approve uh and even if successful well
 
00:28:47.630 --> 00:28:47.640 align:start position:0%
that business still has to pay 3040
 
00:28:51.029 --> 00:28:51.039 align:start position:0%
$50,000 uh to defend itself um because
 
00:28:52.669 --> 00:28:52.679 align:start position:0%
everyone pays their own attorney fees
 
00:28:56.430 --> 00:28:56.440 align:start position:0%
for the most part uh in the US um so I
 
00:28:58.750 --> 00:28:58.760 align:start position:0%
want to say uh kind of a point that was
 
00:29:01.149 --> 00:29:01.159 align:start position:0%
made up um yeah even though these cases
 
00:29:04.789 --> 00:29:04.799 align:start position:0%
will be hard to win uh even if winning
 
00:29:06.149 --> 00:29:06.159 align:start position:0%
that business still has to pay that
 
00:29:07.990 --> 00:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
money while they're already struggling
 
00:29:10.750 --> 00:29:10.760 align:start position:0%
from the coronavirus pandemic uh I also
 
00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:12.640 align:start position:0%
want to mention that this law would only
 
00:29:14.149 --> 00:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
apply to those businesses following
 
00:29:16.029 --> 00:29:16.039 align:start position:0%
state and federal guidelines for
 
00:29:19.470 --> 00:29:19.480 align:start position:0%
operating during the pandemic um and uh
 
00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:22.960 align:start position:0%
so the issue that was brought up about
 
00:29:25.269 --> 00:29:25.279 align:start position:0%
immunizing negligence well if you're not
 
00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:28.360 align:start position:0%
following the uh state or federal
 
00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
guidelines well yeah you can be sued and
 
00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:33.200 align:start position:0%
you should be um even in the eyes of you
 
00:29:35.669 --> 00:29:35.679 align:start position:0%
know the Bia um you know we're not going
 
00:29:37.789 --> 00:29:37.799 align:start position:0%
to protect Bad actors here this is just
 
00:29:40.430 --> 00:29:40.440 align:start position:0%
people are businesses who are uh doing
 
00:29:42.870 --> 00:29:42.880 align:start position:0%
their best to help prevent the spread of
 
00:29:46.269 --> 00:29:46.279 align:start position:0%
covid-19 just like everybody else um
 
00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:48.480 align:start position:0%
it's been asked how many have been filed
 
00:29:50.509 --> 00:29:50.519 align:start position:0%
uh over 200 lawsuits of this type have
 
00:29:53.070 --> 00:29:53.080 align:start position:0%
been filed across the country uh none
 
00:29:55.630 --> 00:29:55.640 align:start position:0%
have been filed in New Hampshire yet um
 
00:29:57.310 --> 00:29:57.320 align:start position:0%
but there is a three-year statute of
 
00:29:59.590 --> 00:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
limitations in New Hampshire so it could
 
00:30:02.669 --> 00:30:02.679 align:start position:0%
happen um at some point um and I also
 
00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:04.840 align:start position:0%
want to bring up that if there are never
 
00:30:07.149 --> 00:30:07.159 align:start position:0%
going to be lawsuits filed in the state
 
00:30:08.990 --> 00:30:09.000 align:start position:0%
well then passing the bill does no harm
 
00:30:10.909 --> 00:30:10.919 align:start position:0%
there's no issue with doing it those
 
00:30:12.149 --> 00:30:12.159 align:start position:0%
lawsuits never would have been filed
 
00:30:14.950 --> 00:30:14.960 align:start position:0%
anyway but if they would have been filed
 
00:30:17.310 --> 00:30:17.320 align:start position:0%
and could have put a business this law
 
00:30:19.669 --> 00:30:19.679 align:start position:0%
could prevent businesses um from having
 
00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:22.440 align:start position:0%
to pay these excessive legal fees and uh
 
00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
putting that business uh down
 
00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
permanently I also want to address um a
 
00:30:30.389 --> 00:30:30.399 align:start position:0%
couple issues I think uh representative
 
00:30:33.590 --> 00:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
Burj asked about frivolous lawsuits uh
 
00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:36.120 align:start position:0%
the burden to meet uh frivolous lawsuit
 
00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:38.200 align:start position:0%
to get into those penalties is pretty
 
00:30:41.630 --> 00:30:41.640 align:start position:0%
high um and so what ends up happening is
 
00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:45.720 align:start position:0%
a person could sue a company for
 
00:30:49.070 --> 00:30:49.080 align:start position:0%
$20,000 uh claiming damages from covid
 
00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:51.200 align:start position:0%
but if it cost $30,000 to defend well
 
00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:52.880 align:start position:0%
the business has to pay they're going to
 
00:30:54.389 --> 00:30:54.399 align:start position:0%
make that decision to just pay out the
 
00:30:56.950 --> 00:30:56.960 align:start position:0%
settlement well then the next person
 
00:30:59.789 --> 00:30:59.799 align:start position:0%
comes and the next person and it's it's
 
00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:02.080 align:start position:0%
really this bill will help prevent that
 
00:31:04.549 --> 00:31:04.559 align:start position:0%
from ever occurring in the first place
 
00:31:07.149 --> 00:31:07.159 align:start position:0%
uh and my last Point here I know we got
 
00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:11.240 align:start position:0%
a short on time um it was asked about uh
 
00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:12.760 align:start position:0%
States and how many other states have
 
00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:15.880 align:start position:0%
passed similar laws uh by my research 19
 
00:31:17.870 --> 00:31:17.880 align:start position:0%
other states have already passed similar
 
00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
legislation to this uh and another 17
 
00:31:23.509 --> 00:31:23.519 align:start position:0%
other than New Hampshire are currently
 
00:31:27.430 --> 00:31:27.440 align:start position:0%
considering those laws as well thank you
 
00:31:28.830 --> 00:31:28.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
00:31:30.149 --> 00:31:30.159 align:start position:0%
representative haran did you have a
 
00:31:34.629 --> 00:31:34.639 align:start position:0%
question for Mr queer uh well yes uh I
 
00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
noticed um in the language in this bill
 
00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:40.480 align:start position:0%
like in the paragraph two of the part
 
00:31:42.190 --> 00:31:42.200 align:start position:0%
it's intended apply only to protect
 
00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
businesses but it does also apply to
 
00:31:47.310 --> 00:31:47.320 align:start position:0%
individuals so would you want to clarify
 
00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
the law to make sure that we're only
 
00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:53.200 align:start position:0%
protecting uh business you know persons
 
00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
other than natural persons that is
 
00:31:57.389 --> 00:31:57.399 align:start position:0%
businesses and other institutions
 
00:31:59.830 --> 00:31:59.840 align:start position:0%
individuals or are you happy with the
 
00:32:02.430 --> 00:32:02.440 align:start position:0%
language as is thank
 
00:32:05.310 --> 00:32:05.320 align:start position:0%
you um yeah that's a great question uh
 
00:32:07.629 --> 00:32:07.639 align:start position:0%
we're happy with the language as is um
 
00:32:09.029 --> 00:32:09.039 align:start position:0%
you know it's not just an issue
 
00:32:10.750 --> 00:32:10.760 align:start position:0%
obviously I represent businesses so
 
00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
that's uh where my testimony comes from
 
00:32:15.389 --> 00:32:15.399 align:start position:0%
but this would affect you know schools
 
00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:18.240 align:start position:0%
places of worship uh public parks you
 
00:32:20.029 --> 00:32:20.039 align:start position:0%
know so the municipalities or any you
 
00:32:21.710 --> 00:32:21.720 align:start position:0%
know thing that building that they own
 
00:32:23.950 --> 00:32:23.960 align:start position:0%
that's open to the public really any uh
 
00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
place where public can gather could see
 
00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
themselves uh facing these types of
 
00:32:31.789 --> 00:32:31.799 align:start position:0%
lawsuits representative McLean uh yeah
 
00:32:34.669 --> 00:32:34.679 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair just quickly Mr queer
 
00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
um back to my earlier question uh who
 
00:32:41.389 --> 00:32:41.399 align:start position:0%
makes the determination of good faith as
 
00:32:44.230 --> 00:32:44.240 align:start position:0%
to whether or not the the case can go
 
00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:46.240 align:start position:0%
forward that's that's a decision that
 
00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:48.360 align:start position:0%
has to be made and it can't be made by
 
00:32:50.789 --> 00:32:50.799 align:start position:0%
the party so under this law who makes
 
00:32:54.029 --> 00:32:54.039 align:start position:0%
that determination and how would that
 
00:32:57.430 --> 00:32:57.440 align:start position:0%
happen uh it's great question um I will
 
00:32:59.789 --> 00:32:59.799 align:start position:0%
preface this by saying that I am not a
 
00:33:02.029 --> 00:33:02.039 align:start position:0%
trial attorney I've never done
 
00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:04.200 align:start position:0%
litigation uh but my understanding would
 
00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
be that if that business is following
 
00:33:09.149 --> 00:33:09.159 align:start position:0%
all of the state and federal guidelines
 
00:33:10.590 --> 00:33:10.600 align:start position:0%
then it's pretty clear that they were
 
00:33:12.149 --> 00:33:12.159 align:start position:0%
acting in good faith to follow them
 
00:33:14.029 --> 00:33:14.039 align:start position:0%
because they were in fact following them
 
00:33:16.350 --> 00:33:16.360 align:start position:0%
uh and that could be made by a judge uh
 
00:33:19.230 --> 00:33:19.240 align:start position:0%
in summary judgment now if they were
 
00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:21.720 align:start position:0%
lacking in specific Provisions you know
 
00:33:23.629 --> 00:33:23.639 align:start position:0%
like they didn't require masks or
 
00:33:26.190 --> 00:33:26.200 align:start position:0%
something like that um then that would
 
00:33:28.629 --> 00:33:28.639 align:start position:0%
have to have a little bit more Discovery
 
00:33:30.350 --> 00:33:30.360 align:start position:0%
in order to determine whether or not was
 
00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
acting in good faith but I think you
 
00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:32.750 align:start position:0%
acting in good faith but I think you
know

00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:32.760 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
99.9% of businesses are following all of
 
00:33:37.590 --> 00:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
the guidance so it would be a pretty
 
00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
easy clear determination that could be
 
00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:42.720 align:start position:0%
made by a judge thank you representative
 
00:33:46.029 --> 00:33:46.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:50.430 --> 00:33:50.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
good thank thank you uh any other
 
00:33:55.950 --> 00:33:55.960 align:start position:0%

to uh first say that um well well first
 
00:34:25.510 --> 00:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
my name is Bill Woodbury and I am a
 
00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
practicing attorney in T New Hampshire
 
00:34:31.349 --> 00:34:31.359 align:start position:0%
uh and um I also serve as legislative
 
00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:33.240 align:start position:0%
chair for the New Hampshire Association
 
00:34:36.669 --> 00:34:36.679 align:start position:0%
for justice um I rise in opposition to
 
00:34:36.679 --> 00:34:37.389 align:start position:0%
for justice um I rise in opposition to
this

00:34:37.389 --> 00:34:37.399 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:34:40.950 --> 00:34:40.960 align:start position:0%
bill uh I would like to uh indicate that
 
00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
I would Echo the comments made by
 
00:34:44.869 --> 00:34:44.879 align:start position:0%
representative uh
 
00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
Pedra and would incorporate them into my
 
00:34:51.310 --> 00:34:51.320 align:start position:0%
own in full um but uh given the limited
 
00:34:54.270 --> 00:34:54.280 align:start position:0%
time I just want to kind of address um
 
00:34:56.069 --> 00:34:56.079 align:start position:0%
you know what representative Stapleton
 
00:34:58.829 --> 00:34:58.839 align:start position:0%
and representative CER have have stated
 
00:35:00.829 --> 00:35:00.839 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry Mr CER have rep have
 
00:35:03.349 --> 00:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
represented here regarding that you know
 
00:35:07.550 --> 00:35:07.560 align:start position:0%
businesses are are worried um and I
 
00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:10.680 align:start position:0%
think that you know this worry is is is
 
00:35:16.069 --> 00:35:16.079 align:start position:0%
fostered by this kind of um
 
00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
uh this
 
00:35:20.589 --> 00:35:20.599 align:start position:0%
persistent um you know Spectre of
 
00:35:23.069 --> 00:35:23.079 align:start position:0%
frivilous lawsuits that just doesn't
 
00:35:25.510 --> 00:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
bear out in the state of New Hampshire
 
00:35:30.349 --> 00:35:30.359 align:start position:0%
um as uh Mr CER and Mr Stapleton I think
 
00:35:32.670 --> 00:35:32.680 align:start position:0%
uh agreed there are there have been no
 
00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:34.200 align:start position:0%
cases filed in the state of New
 
00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:36.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and Mr CER indicated that
 
00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:39.160 align:start position:0%
there were 200 lawsuits Nationwide I
 
00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:41.200 align:start position:0%
don't know that that is I don't know if
 
00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
that's the correct number or not but I
 
00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
do know that um you know of that have
 
00:35:48.910 --> 00:35:48.920 align:start position:0%
been filed 96 are in California 50 are
 
00:35:51.390 --> 00:35:51.400 align:start position:0%
in New York and then you know another
 
00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:53.640 align:start position:0%
smattering throughout the country but
 
00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:55.000 align:start position:0%
none in the state of New Hampshire and
 
00:35:58.309 --> 00:35:58.319 align:start position:0%
they're not being filed because these
 
00:36:02.230 --> 00:36:02.240 align:start position:0%
are cases that as uh Israel Pedra
 
00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:03.720 align:start position:0%
indicated you know it would be
 
00:36:09.150 --> 00:36:09.160 align:start position:0%
exceedingly difficult um to prove um and
 
00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:12.880 align:start position:0%
the expense to an attorney who takes on
 
00:36:14.309 --> 00:36:14.319 align:start position:0%
one of these cases who would have to
 
00:36:17.390 --> 00:36:17.400 align:start position:0%
front the the uh expenses for experts
 
00:36:20.510 --> 00:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
and things like that would be extreme um
 
00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
David CER you know talked about somebody
 
00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
fing a lawsuit for $20,000 or something
 
00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
like that that would never occur the
 
00:36:29.710 --> 00:36:29.720 align:start position:0%
expert fees alone in a in a case of this
 
00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
nature could likely exceed that number
 
00:36:34.390 --> 00:36:34.400 align:start position:0%
you would be hiring medical doctors
 
00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:37.200 align:start position:0%
epidemiologists it would be exceedingly
 
00:36:38.470 --> 00:36:38.480 align:start position:0%
difficult to bring one of these cases
 
00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:39.720 align:start position:0%
and that's why you're not seeing them
 
00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:41.200 align:start position:0%
and that's why you're not going to see
 
00:36:45.910 --> 00:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
them um and um I want to address the the
 
00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
the good faith comment that um Mr Cryer
 
00:36:51.829 --> 00:36:51.839 align:start position:0%
made um with respect to good faith you
 
00:36:53.870 --> 00:36:53.880 align:start position:0%
know he indicated that good faith would
 
00:36:56.270 --> 00:36:56.280 align:start position:0%
be following the guidelines well um
 
00:36:58.230 --> 00:36:58.240 align:start position:0%
currently the current law as
 
00:36:59.710 --> 00:36:59.720 align:start position:0%
representative Pedra mentioned the
 
00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:02.560 align:start position:0%
current law um is that if one is
 
00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
negligent um then they are going to be
 
00:37:07.030 --> 00:37:07.040 align:start position:0%
liable potentially liable for someone's
 
00:37:09.390 --> 00:37:09.400 align:start position:0%
injuries and negligence is about acting
 
00:37:11.470 --> 00:37:11.480 align:start position:0%
unreasonably if you're acting reasonably
 
00:37:12.670 --> 00:37:12.680 align:start position:0%
you're not going to be found to be
 
00:37:17.109 --> 00:37:17.119 align:start position:0%
negligent if your three are up if you
 
00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:19.480 align:start position:0%
could wrap up that would be great I I
 
00:37:22.589 --> 00:37:22.599 align:start position:0%
will I I guess my uh my main point is
 
00:37:25.109 --> 00:37:25.119 align:start position:0%
that this as uh representative Pedra
 
00:37:27.150 --> 00:37:27.160 align:start position:0%
indicated is um
 
00:37:30.190 --> 00:37:30.200 align:start position:0%
a a solution in search of of a problem
 
00:37:31.270 --> 00:37:31.280 align:start position:0%
it's it's
 
00:37:33.630 --> 00:37:33.640 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional it undermines part one
 
00:37:35.950 --> 00:37:35.960 align:start position:0%
article 14 you thank you for your
 
00:37:37.470 --> 00:37:37.480 align:start position:0%

name's Michael dears I'm the owner of
 
00:38:15.190 --> 00:38:15.200 align:start position:0%
CCI managed services in Claremont um I
 
00:38:17.069 --> 00:38:17.079 align:start position:0%
worked with Walt uh it was my concern
 
00:38:18.670 --> 00:38:18.680 align:start position:0%
that got him uh to start looking into
 
00:38:20.829 --> 00:38:20.839 align:start position:0%
this and I appreciate all your time um
 
00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:22.680 align:start position:0%
I've got 20 employees uh we've been in
 
00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:24.640 align:start position:0%
business over 30 years uh we provide
 
00:38:26.870 --> 00:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
critical IT services mostly Hampshire
 
00:38:28.349 --> 00:38:28.359 align:start position:0%
Vermont but we have clients in five
 
00:38:32.390 --> 00:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
other states um my my concern stems from
 
00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
um the Spectre of lawsuits primarily you
 
00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:38.240 align:start position:0%
know where're we understand that there's
 
00:38:39.589 --> 00:38:39.599 align:start position:0%
uh you
 
00:38:42.390 --> 00:38:42.400 align:start position:0%
know that that the reality is that there
 
00:38:44.349 --> 00:38:44.359 align:start position:0%
uh may not be a lot of lawsuits being
 
00:38:46.430 --> 00:38:46.440 align:start position:0%
won on this but the the possibility of
 
00:38:49.710 --> 00:38:49.720 align:start position:0%
just being sued and having 203 $50,000
 
00:38:52.829 --> 00:38:52.839 align:start position:0%
law uh suit cost just to defend yourself
 
00:38:54.670 --> 00:38:54.680 align:start position:0%
that type of cost is is what's keeping
 
00:38:57.630 --> 00:38:57.640 align:start position:0%
me up at night um I know in working with
 
00:38:59.190 --> 00:38:59.200 align:start position:0%
almost a 100 customers that are
 
00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:01.440 align:start position:0%
organizations and businesses this is a
 
00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
topic of conversation and most other
 
00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
business owners feel the same way um so
 
00:39:08.230 --> 00:39:08.240 align:start position:0%
it may not necessarily be I I think the
 
00:39:10.109 --> 00:39:10.119 align:start position:0%
reality is we're dealing with something
 
00:39:12.990 --> 00:39:13.000 align:start position:0%
that um is creating a lot of fear um
 
00:39:14.990 --> 00:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
about litigation um even if that
 
00:39:17.630 --> 00:39:17.640 align:start position:0%
litigation does not result in in uh in
 
00:39:20.870 --> 00:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
actually having to to pay um as the as
 
00:39:22.550 --> 00:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
the defendant most likely would would
 
00:39:23.950 --> 00:39:23.960 align:start position:0%
would be looking at legal fees and
 
00:39:27.589 --> 00:39:27.599 align:start position:0%
probably not more than that um on a
 
00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:30.560 align:start position:0%
personal note I also belong to a 12-step
 
00:39:33.150 --> 00:39:33.160 align:start position:0%
program um and uh here in Claremont we
 
00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
had over a 100 members and and uh we
 
00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
were all meeting in a in a local church
 
00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:39.240 align:start position:0%
basement you know for five six seven
 
00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
meetings a week um you know this is
 
00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:42.720 align:start position:0%
important stuff for those of us that
 
00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
that need to do that and um I just want
 
00:39:47.829 --> 00:39:47.839 align:start position:0%
you to know that th that church uh
 
00:39:50.470 --> 00:39:50.480 align:start position:0%
closed its doors to to our group uh a
 
00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:52.720 align:start position:0%
year ago and has refused to reopen them
 
00:39:54.109 --> 00:39:54.119 align:start position:0%
and they they're citing liability
 
00:39:56.550 --> 00:39:56.560 align:start position:0%
concerns that's their concern so whether
 
00:39:59.870 --> 00:39:59.880 align:start position:0%
this is something that is uh real or not
 
00:40:02.829 --> 00:40:02.839 align:start position:0%
um the reality in in on the street is
 
00:40:05.550 --> 00:40:05.560 align:start position:0%
that um you know you're you're going to
 
00:40:06.829 --> 00:40:06.839 align:start position:0%
have those types of things happening
 
00:40:09.589 --> 00:40:09.599 align:start position:0%
when people are in fear of being sued
 
00:40:12.309 --> 00:40:12.319 align:start position:0%
over covid liability a bill like this
 
00:40:14.990 --> 00:40:15.000 align:start position:0%
could could help to uh open those doors
 
00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
up again and get people the help they
 
00:40:18.790 --> 00:40:18.800 align:start position:0%
need um and that I think is a really
 
00:40:20.870 --> 00:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
important uh side issue so thank you for

summary almost four Decades of practice
 
00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:41.440 align:start position:0%
in law New Hampshire businesses and
 
00:42:44.670 --> 00:42:44.680 align:start position:0%
individuals just need to act
 
00:42:47.549 --> 00:42:47.559 align:start position:0%
reasonably if you act reasonably that's
 
00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
all the the Hampshire law
 
00:42:52.589 --> 00:42:52.599 align:start position:0%
requires the 2012 New Hampshire Supreme
 
00:42:55.270 --> 00:42:55.280 align:start position:0%
Court case of Tom Morgan gives an
 
00:42:57.430 --> 00:42:57.440 align:start position:0%
excellent summary of the New Hampshire
 
00:43:00.030 --> 00:43:00.040 align:start position:0%
standards on reasonableness the very
 
00:43:02.430 --> 00:43:02.440 align:start position:0%
moral fabric of a civilized society is
 
00:43:04.030 --> 00:43:04.040 align:start position:0%
summed up in their
 
00:43:07.750 --> 00:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
words responsibility for personal
 
00:43:11.309 --> 00:43:11.319 align:start position:0%
malens runs through all relations of
 
00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:15.720 align:start position:0%
individuals each of us to the other what
 
00:43:18.069 --> 00:43:18.079 align:start position:0%
this bill would do is remove that moral
 
00:43:20.910 --> 00:43:20.920 align:start position:0%
Fabric and allow Bad actors to act
 
00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
unreasonably unless it can be proven
 
00:43:25.470 --> 00:43:25.480 align:start position:0%
that they acted willful wanting
 
00:43:28.230 --> 00:43:28.240 align:start position:0%
malicious and intentional I ask that you
 
00:43:29.950 --> 00:43:29.960 align:start position:0%

volunteer meetings or fundraising events
 
00:44:38.470 --> 00:44:38.480 align:start position:0%
in person as safety measures for our

to resume imperson events we appreciate
 
00:44:54.309 --> 00:44:54.319 align:start position:0%
the liability protections House Bill 149
 
00:44:56.470 --> 00:44:56.480 align:start position:0%
would provide should either the co 19
 
00:44:58.230 --> 00:44:58.240 align:start position:0%
pandemic or another Public Health
 
00:45:01.150 --> 00:45:01.160 align:start position:0%
Emergency be present the prospect of
 
00:45:03.950 --> 00:45:03.960 align:start position:0%
litigation and the exorbitant legal
 
00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:06.880 align:start position:0%
costs is unnerving to organizations like
 
00:45:09.870 --> 00:45:09.880 align:start position:0%
ours um and even a deterrent to
 
00:45:12.150 --> 00:45:12.160 align:start position:0%
reopening um such litigation could
 
00:45:13.870 --> 00:45:13.880 align:start position:0%
devastate entities just beginning to
 
00:45:15.710 --> 00:45:15.720 align:start position:0%
reopen their doors and even those who
 
00:45:17.109 --> 00:45:17.119 align:start position:0%
have remained open throughout this
 
00:45:19.829 --> 00:45:19.839 align:start position:0%
recent crisis covid-19 has had a
 
00:45:21.670 --> 00:45:21.680 align:start position:0%
devastating impact on nonprofit
 
00:45:23.549 --> 00:45:23.559 align:start position:0%
organizations like the American Heart
 
00:45:25.390 --> 00:45:25.400 align:start position:0%
Association because of the fact that we
 
00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
have been doing remote fundraising
 
00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
events um uh the threat of frivolous
 
00:45:32.069 --> 00:45:32.079 align:start position:0%
lawsuits is a real concern and
 
00:45:33.910 --> 00:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
nonprofits like the American hard
 
00:45:35.589 --> 00:45:35.599 align:start position:0%
Association who are following and
 
00:45:37.510 --> 00:45:37.520 align:start position:0%
maintaining safety guidelines and need
 
00:45:39.910 --> 00:45:39.920 align:start position:0%
protection to safely maintain business
 
00:45:42.230 --> 00:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
House Bill 149 would not extend
 
00:45:44.430 --> 00:45:44.440 align:start position:0%
liability protection to Shield gross
 
00:45:47.510 --> 00:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
negligence or willful misconduct um I
 
00:45:50.470 --> 00:45:50.480 align:start position:0%
also want to just um make reference to
 
00:45:52.510 --> 00:45:52.520 align:start position:0%
um an example that we have here in New
 
00:45:55.950 --> 00:45:55.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um many years ago the uh the
 
00:45:58.150 --> 00:45:58.160 align:start position:0%
the um the state did provide limited
 
00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
liability for Good Samaritans who
 
00:46:04.670 --> 00:46:04.680 align:start position:0%
perform CPR on total strangers um and
 
00:46:07.750 --> 00:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
several years um uh ago well almost 20
 
00:46:11.109 --> 00:46:11.119 align:start position:0%
years ago the um the state also passed
 
00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
um limited liability for automated
 
00:46:16.190 --> 00:46:16.200 align:start position:0%
external defibrillator use um also known
 
00:46:19.990 --> 00:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
as aeds this um liability protection was
 
00:46:22.270 --> 00:46:22.280 align:start position:0%
also extended to the owners of the aeds
 
00:46:25.190 --> 00:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
as well as the users of the aeds and
 
00:46:26.990 --> 00:46:27.000 align:start position:0%
basically what this did there were no
 
00:46:28.990 --> 00:46:29.000 align:start position:0%
lawsuits at the time that the this law
 
00:46:33.230 --> 00:46:33.240 align:start position:0%
was passed um but we needed to um help
 
00:46:35.630 --> 00:46:35.640 align:start position:0%
businesses and others who should have
 
00:46:40.109 --> 00:46:40.119 align:start position:0%
aeds not fear frivolous um lawsuits um
 
00:46:41.950 --> 00:46:41.960 align:start position:0%
and so what this did in the end is it
 
00:46:44.430 --> 00:46:44.440 align:start position:0%
did encourage more aeds to be out in the
 
00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:48.720 align:start position:0%
community um so saving lives so in um in
 
00:46:51.030 --> 00:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
conclusion I just want to say that we we
 
00:46:53.790 --> 00:46:53.800 align:start position:0%
again are in support of House Bill 149
 
00:46:55.829 --> 00:46:55.839 align:start position:0%
um uh charitable entities are list
 
00:46:58.270 --> 00:46:58.280 align:start position:0%
listed in this um in the language to the
 
00:47:00.750 --> 00:47:00.760 align:start position:0%
bill and we definitely appreciate that
 
00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
and I urge you to uh to pass the Bill
 
00:47:05.430 --> 00:47:05.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very
 
00:47:07.910 --> 00:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
much repres representative Smith I saw
 
00:47:12.990 --> 00:47:13.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:16.829 --> 00:47:16.839 align:start position:0%
up thank you Mr chair I decided um there
 
00:47:19.190 --> 00:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
was no reason to ask a question in light
 
00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:22.240 align:start position:0%
of how long this uh hearing is going
 
00:47:25.309 --> 00:47:25.319 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Horgan okay
 
00:47:28.710 --> 00:47:28.720 align:start position:0%
I'll try make this quick um I saw your
 
00:47:32.270 --> 00:47:32.280 align:start position:0%
letter um V it sounds like you're me the
 
00:47:35.990 --> 00:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
primary concern a year ago is not uh the
 
00:47:38.549 --> 00:47:38.559 align:start position:0%
fear of being sued so much as a fear of
 
00:47:41.109 --> 00:47:41.119 align:start position:0%
you know your volunteers or your staff
 
00:47:43.430 --> 00:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
people you know catching uh catching
 
00:47:45.190 --> 00:47:45.200 align:start position:0%
covid which and suffering the obviously
 
00:47:48.190 --> 00:47:48.200 align:start position:0%
Spar health things and dying so your
 
00:47:49.549 --> 00:47:49.559 align:start position:0%
your support for this bill at this point
 
00:47:52.470 --> 00:47:52.480 align:start position:0%
mostly looking forward your fear getting
 
00:47:55.230 --> 00:47:55.240 align:start position:0%
sued so you are viewing this different
 
00:47:56.589 --> 00:47:56.599 align:start position:0%
now that
 
00:47:58.470 --> 00:47:58.480 align:start position:0%
um we have vaccines we have somewhat
 
00:48:00.390 --> 00:48:00.400 align:start position:0%
effective treatments masks are available
 
00:48:04.109 --> 00:48:04.119 align:start position:0%
and widely used Etc so are you is your
 
00:48:06.950 --> 00:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
fear of lawsuits um looming larger now
 
00:48:09.270 --> 00:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
that the maybe the safety concerns are
 
00:48:12.109 --> 00:48:12.119 align:start position:0%
not quite as uh severe as they were a
 
00:48:14.390 --> 00:48:14.400 align:start position:0%
year ago when this whole crisis started
 
00:48:16.470 --> 00:48:16.480 align:start position:0%
yep yes um thank you for your question
 
00:48:18.670 --> 00:48:18.680 align:start position:0%
um yes when we we closed down it was
 
00:48:20.790 --> 00:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
because we were being responsible um
 
00:48:24.030 --> 00:48:24.040 align:start position:0%
stewards for our our volunteers um now
 
00:48:26.510 --> 00:48:26.520 align:start position:0%
it is really the open reopening concerns
 
00:48:29.270 --> 00:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
and while vaccinations are rolling out
 
00:48:31.270 --> 00:48:31.280 align:start position:0%
it vaccinations will just protect the
 
00:48:33.390 --> 00:48:33.400 align:start position:0%
person being vaccinated they can still
 
00:48:36.190 --> 00:48:36.200 align:start position:0%
pass transmit virus onto others if they
 
00:48:39.030 --> 00:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
are not wearing face masks and with what
 
00:48:41.870 --> 00:48:41.880 align:start position:0%
we're we're hearing people are ready to
 
00:48:43.950 --> 00:48:43.960 align:start position:0%
dispense with wearing face masks and
 
00:48:45.910 --> 00:48:45.920 align:start position:0%
that is something that we will continue
 
00:48:48.230 --> 00:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
requiring um but we can't control
 
00:48:50.670 --> 00:48:50.680 align:start position:0%
everyone's Behavior so thank
 
00:48:54.710 --> 00:48:54.720 align:start position:0%
you follow up so the the lawsuit are
 
00:48:56.990 --> 00:48:57.000 align:start position:0%
your it's just secondary concern your
 
00:48:58.670 --> 00:48:58.680 align:start position:0%
main concern is the safety of the of the
 
00:49:00.390 --> 00:49:00.400 align:start position:0%
people you're you're working with either
 
00:49:03.109 --> 00:49:03.119 align:start position:0%
virtually or in person so just one yes
 
00:49:05.270 --> 00:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
our main concern is always our our our
 
00:49:09.430 --> 00:49:09.440 align:start position:0%
volunteers um donors and staff thank
 
00:49:12.190 --> 00:49:12.200 align:start position:0%

00:49:15.789 --> 00:49:15.799 align:start position:0%
Von seeing them again thank you for your
 
00:49:20.630 --> 00:49:20.640 align:start position:0%
testimony the next person is Tony
 
00:49:24.510 --> 00:49:24.520 align:start position:0%
skini and I hope I pronounced that
 
00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:37.630 align:start position:0%
skini and I hope I pronounced that
correctly

00:49:37.630 --> 00:49:37.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:40.589 --> 00:49:40.599 align:start position:0%
y hello my name is Anthony skull I'm a
 
00:49:42.950 --> 00:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
lawyer in nashwa a firm Gillan skull and
 
00:49:44.630 --> 00:49:44.640 align:start position:0%
brini and I have uh two things I just
 
00:49:46.910 --> 00:49:46.920 align:start position:0%
want to briefly mention they deal with
 
00:49:50.270 --> 00:49:50.280 align:start position:0%
the logistics and the finances of AOSS
 
00:49:51.950 --> 00:49:51.960 align:start position:0%
so one thing that I've heard from a lot
 
00:49:55.630 --> 00:49:55.640 align:start position:0%
of people is the issue of lawyers fees
 
00:49:58.150 --> 00:49:58.160 align:start position:0%
uh it's most of the most of the time
 
00:50:01.470 --> 00:50:01.480 align:start position:0%
cases are brought uh when there is some
 
00:50:04.309 --> 00:50:04.319 align:start position:0%
insurance defense firm on the other side
 
00:50:07.030 --> 00:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
and I say that because if it's a if it's
 
00:50:09.349 --> 00:50:09.359 align:start position:0%
a small business and they have very few
 
00:50:12.430 --> 00:50:12.440 align:start position:0%
assets and the case itself involves you
 
00:50:14.150 --> 00:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
know relatively low damage it's
 
00:50:17.150 --> 00:50:17.160 align:start position:0%
generally not financially viable for a
 
00:50:18.789 --> 00:50:18.799 align:start position:0%
lawyer to take that case because they're
 
00:50:21.750 --> 00:50:21.760 align:start position:0%
taking those cases on a contingency fee
 
00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
which means that the lawyer pays out all
 
00:50:26.069 --> 00:50:26.079 align:start position:0%
of the expert costs and then recovers
 
00:50:28.710 --> 00:50:28.720 align:start position:0%
those costs plus his fee only if he
 
00:50:31.950 --> 00:50:31.960 align:start position:0%
collects so if there's no you know if
 
00:50:34.430 --> 00:50:34.440 align:start position:0%
the damages are low like the one example
 
00:50:36.829 --> 00:50:36.839 align:start position:0%
that was given a $20,000 lawsuit no
 
00:50:38.510 --> 00:50:38.520 align:start position:0%
one's going to take that case because of
 
00:50:41.309 --> 00:50:41.319 align:start position:0%
the financial requirements in bringing a
 
00:50:44.230 --> 00:50:44.240 align:start position:0%
contingency fee case on an issue as
 
00:50:46.789 --> 00:50:46.799 align:start position:0%
difficult to track as covid-19 uh one
 
00:50:48.430 --> 00:50:48.440 align:start position:0%
other point I wanted to talk about is
 
00:50:51.190 --> 00:50:51.200 align:start position:0%
this idea about how this immunity would
 
00:50:54.190 --> 00:50:54.200 align:start position:0%
operate so the gentleman from The
 
00:50:56.670 --> 00:50:56.680 align:start position:0%
Business Association talked about how
 
00:50:58.349 --> 00:50:58.359 align:start position:0%
this would work and I think that what we
 
00:51:01.150 --> 00:51:01.160 align:start position:0%
need to focus on here is the the steps
 
00:51:03.870 --> 00:51:03.880 align:start position:0%
in the process so a motion to dismiss
 
00:51:06.789 --> 00:51:06.799 align:start position:0%
can be filed for some sort of uh formal
 
00:51:09.549 --> 00:51:09.559 align:start position:0%
or procedural flaw if we're talking
 
00:51:11.750 --> 00:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
about an issue where there's no factual
 
00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
dispute and only a dispute about what
 
00:51:15.710 --> 00:51:15.720 align:start position:0%
the law means then that's appropriately
 
00:51:17.789 --> 00:51:17.799 align:start position:0%
determined at subing judgment which is
 
00:51:20.390 --> 00:51:20.400 align:start position:0%
done after discovery if we're talking
 
00:51:21.789 --> 00:51:21.799 align:start position:0%
about determining whether or not
 
00:51:23.829 --> 00:51:23.839 align:start position:0%
somebody followed a good faith
 
00:51:26.109 --> 00:51:26.119 align:start position:0%
requirement that's almost certainly a
 
00:51:28.190 --> 00:51:28.200 align:start position:0%
factual dispute and that would get
 
00:51:31.470 --> 00:51:31.480 align:start position:0%
settled by a jury so as written this
 
00:51:33.750 --> 00:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
bill would not provide the immunities
 
00:51:36.309 --> 00:51:36.319 align:start position:0%
that people think it would because the
 
00:51:39.270 --> 00:51:39.280 align:start position:0%
way in which lawsuits are dismissed is
 
00:51:41.470 --> 00:51:41.480 align:start position:0%
based largely on the kind of dispute it
 
00:51:43.549 --> 00:51:43.559 align:start position:0%
is and by including this good faith
 
00:51:45.990 --> 00:51:46.000 align:start position:0%
exception you're all but guaranteeing
 
00:51:48.030 --> 00:51:48.040 align:start position:0%
that the issue goes all the way to a
 
00:51:50.589 --> 00:51:50.599 align:start position:0%
jury so I think that this law this law
 
00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
is unnecessary you can go to cracker.com
 
00:51:55.589 --> 00:51:55.599 align:start position:0%
and see that there are zero lawsuits in
 
00:51:57.589 --> 00:51:57.599 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I think the idea that it
 
00:52:00.030 --> 00:52:00.040 align:start position:0%
would provide some sort of Sav for the
 
00:52:02.349 --> 00:52:02.359 align:start position:0%
fears that people have is misleading
 
00:52:03.990 --> 00:52:04.000 align:start position:0%
because of the way in which lawsuits are
 
00:52:06.109 --> 00:52:06.119 align:start position:0%
dismissed and I think that the financial
 
00:52:08.670 --> 00:52:08.680 align:start position:0%
viability of covid lawsuits is largely
 
00:52:10.750 --> 00:52:10.760 align:start position:0%
going to prohibit any of them from being
 
00:52:13.190 --> 00:52:13.200 align:start position:0%
brought in the state of New Hampshire
 
00:52:16.069 --> 00:52:16.079 align:start position:0%
and so I am an opposition of this Bill
 
00:52:17.910 --> 00:52:17.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony and are
 
00:52:22.230 --> 00:52:22.240 align:start position:0%

00:52:58.710 --> 00:52:58.720 align:start position:0%
been a long morning um for the record my
 
00:53:00.549 --> 00:53:00.559 align:start position:0%
name is Marissa Chase I'm the executive
 
00:53:01.710 --> 00:53:01.720 align:start position:0%
director for the New Hampshire
 
00:53:04.150 --> 00:53:04.160 align:start position:0%
Association for justice a Statewide
 
00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
Association of trial attorneys uh
 
00:53:09.510 --> 00:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
representing um a wide array of
 
00:53:12.190 --> 00:53:12.200 align:start position:0%
practices in New Hampshire we have about
 
00:53:14.430 --> 00:53:14.440 align:start position:0%
400 members Statewide if there are any
 
00:53:16.549 --> 00:53:16.559 align:start position:0%
legal questions you or any of your
 
00:53:18.670 --> 00:53:18.680 align:start position:0%
constituents may have I can probably
 
00:53:21.510 --> 00:53:21.520 align:start position:0%
find an answer um so I just wanted to
 
00:53:23.150 --> 00:53:23.160 align:start position:0%
reiterate we are in opposition to this
 
00:53:24.870 --> 00:53:24.880 align:start position:0%
bill I did send written testimony which
 
00:53:27.309 --> 00:53:27.319 align:start position:0%
I will will not repeat um I just want to
 
00:53:30.069 --> 00:53:30.079 align:start position:0%
make a few key points liability is
 
00:53:32.870 --> 00:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
accountability the only thing anyone or
 
00:53:35.069 --> 00:53:35.079 align:start position:0%
any business needs to do to not be sued
 
00:53:36.789 --> 00:53:36.799 align:start position:0%
is to act as a reasonable person would
 
00:53:39.030 --> 00:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
under the circumstances and I want to
 
00:53:40.910 --> 00:53:40.920 align:start position:0%
reiterate under the same circumstances
 
00:53:42.430 --> 00:53:42.440 align:start position:0%
because that's a kind of flexibility
 
00:53:44.589 --> 00:53:44.599 align:start position:0%
that has evolved in our common law that
 
00:53:47.109 --> 00:53:47.119 align:start position:0%
lends our common law to situations like
 
00:53:49.270 --> 00:53:49.280 align:start position:0%
this pandemic our tort system has been
 
00:53:51.789 --> 00:53:51.799 align:start position:0%
in effect since the late 1700s attorney
 
00:53:53.190 --> 00:53:53.200 align:start position:0%
suur mentioned the New Hampshire
 
00:53:55.349 --> 00:53:55.359 align:start position:0%
Constitution which the only time time
 
00:53:56.829 --> 00:53:56.839 align:start position:0%
the word sacred is mentioned in the New
 
00:53:59.190 --> 00:53:59.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution is when is an
 
00:54:02.430 --> 00:54:02.440 align:start position:0%
article um part one article it's either
 
00:54:06.430 --> 00:54:06.440 align:start position:0%
14 or 20 that talks about your right to
 
00:54:08.390 --> 00:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
a jury trial of your
 
00:54:13.349 --> 00:54:13.359 align:start position:0%
peers um and I just wanted to um kind of
 
00:54:16.349 --> 00:54:16.359 align:start position:0%
respond to some of the comments made um
 
00:54:18.349 --> 00:54:18.359 align:start position:0%
by an earlier speaker about other
 
00:54:21.030 --> 00:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
immunities this legislature has granted
 
00:54:23.150 --> 00:54:23.160 align:start position:0%
and I would respectfully disagree that
 
00:54:25.470 --> 00:54:25.480 align:start position:0%
providing CPR and reopening a business
 
00:54:28.109 --> 00:54:28.119 align:start position:0%
safely should be equated in law as you
 
00:54:30.910 --> 00:54:30.920 align:start position:0%
know for a Good Samaritan a I think if
 
00:54:32.870 --> 00:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
people are you
 
00:54:36.430 --> 00:54:36.440 align:start position:0%
know if a person is providing necessary
 
00:54:39.190 --> 00:54:39.200 align:start position:0%
Health Care to someone they're probably
 
00:54:40.670 --> 00:54:40.680 align:start position:0%
more worried about saving that person's
 
00:54:42.829 --> 00:54:42.839 align:start position:0%
life not about being sued which is how
 
00:54:46.030 --> 00:54:46.040 align:start position:0%
we should all act um and I just don't
 
00:54:47.589 --> 00:54:47.599 align:start position:0%
think that those two situations should
 
00:54:50.030 --> 00:54:50.040 align:start position:0%
be equated and if a business can't
 
00:54:52.030 --> 00:54:52.040 align:start position:0%
reopen safely you know I would
 
00:54:54.270 --> 00:54:54.280 align:start position:0%
respectfully say that just based on
 
00:54:56.349 --> 00:54:56.359 align:start position:0%
societal health is shouldn't that be the
 
00:54:58.910 --> 00:54:58.920 align:start position:0%
top concern not just focused on
 
00:55:01.069 --> 00:55:01.079 align:start position:0%
liability but that kind of tells me that
 
00:55:03.030 --> 00:55:03.040 align:start position:0%
you need liability because liability
 
00:55:04.789 --> 00:55:04.799 align:start position:0%
lends itself to accountability in making
 
00:55:06.470 --> 00:55:06.480 align:start position:0%
sure that everybody knows the rules and
 
00:55:08.589 --> 00:55:08.599 align:start position:0%
plays by the rules the language in this
 
00:55:10.829 --> 00:55:10.839 align:start position:0%
bill is very vague um not knowing what
 
00:55:14.309 --> 00:55:14.319 align:start position:0%
rules to follow it's not really clear um
 
00:55:16.349 --> 00:55:16.359 align:start position:0%
again representative padra said earlier
 
00:55:18.630 --> 00:55:18.640 align:start position:0%
willful negligence our civil justice
 
00:55:20.270 --> 00:55:20.280 align:start position:0%
system does not recognize degrees of
 
00:55:21.990 --> 00:55:22.000 align:start position:0%
negligence in New Hampshire there's
 
00:55:24.390 --> 00:55:24.400 align:start position:0%
negligence and there's not um you'll
 
00:55:26.750 --> 00:55:26.760 align:start position:0%
find other statutes and criminal codes
 
00:55:28.789 --> 00:55:28.799 align:start position:0%
that talk about mental States but that's
 
00:55:31.349 --> 00:55:31.359 align:start position:0%
not in our civil justice system and one
 
00:55:32.710 --> 00:55:32.720 align:start position:0%
last thing I just want to say that
 
00:55:34.950 --> 00:55:34.960 align:start position:0%
insurance companies defend businesses
 
00:55:36.750 --> 00:55:36.760 align:start position:0%
that's why businesses pay liability
 
00:55:39.109 --> 00:55:39.119 align:start position:0%
policy coverage I don't know of a single
 
00:55:41.750 --> 00:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
liability policy that covers intentional
 
00:55:44.349 --> 00:55:44.359 align:start position:0%
acts and that is the only case if a bill
 
00:55:46.670 --> 00:55:46.680 align:start position:0%
like this were to pass that a business
 
00:55:48.270 --> 00:55:48.280 align:start position:0%
would actually be on the hook for
 
00:55:50.630 --> 00:55:50.640 align:start position:0%
defending a claim against it because
 
00:55:53.349 --> 00:55:53.359 align:start position:0%
under our current structure insurance
 
00:55:55.470 --> 00:55:55.480 align:start position:0%
companies defend a business the business
 
00:55:57.109 --> 00:55:57.119 align:start position:0%
does not have to hire their own defense
 
00:55:59.589 --> 00:55:59.599 align:start position:0%
attorney that's why they pay insurance
 
00:56:01.589 --> 00:56:01.599 align:start position:0%
but if a liability policy does not cover
 
00:56:03.390 --> 00:56:03.400 align:start position:0%
an intentional act they will tell the
 
00:56:05.789 --> 00:56:05.799 align:start position:0%
business not our policy you're out of
 
00:56:10.230 --> 00:56:10.240 align:start position:0%
luck um so I will wrap up and just say I
 
00:56:13.309 --> 00:56:13.319 align:start position:0%
hope that you um vote this bill itl
 
00:56:14.950 --> 00:56:14.960 align:start position:0%
there are a couple other proposals House
 
00:56:17.630 --> 00:56:17.640 align:start position:0%
Bill 255 currently in House Education
 
00:56:20.270 --> 00:56:20.280 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 63 which the Senate just
 
00:56:23.710 --> 00:56:23.720 align:start position:0%
voted 21-3 yesterday to re-refer so if
 
00:56:25.510 --> 00:56:25.520 align:start position:0%
this issue is of concern you'd like to
 
00:56:27.430 --> 00:56:27.440 align:start position:0%
talk further I sent you all an email you
 
00:56:29.230 --> 00:56:29.240 align:start position:0%
have my contact information please don't
 
00:56:31.150 --> 00:56:31.160 align:start position:0%
hesitate to be in touch and thank you
 
00:56:33.029 --> 00:56:33.039 align:start position:0%
very much for your time thank you for
 
00:56:34.789 --> 00:56:34.799 align:start position:0%
your testimony are there any questions
 
00:56:36.870 --> 00:56:36.880 align:start position:0%
for Miss
 
00:56:41.109 --> 00:56:41.119 align:start position:0%
Chase sigan thank you very much and
 
00:56:43.589 --> 00:56:43.599 align:start position:0%
there are two people I see that have
 
00:56:46.230 --> 00:56:46.240 align:start position:0%
their hands raised who wish to testify
 
00:56:48.589 --> 00:56:48.599 align:start position:0%
and hopefully they can add something
 
00:56:51.109 --> 00:56:51.119 align:start position:0%
that something new to our discussion
 
00:56:53.870 --> 00:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
today the first person is Chris
 
00:56:53.880 --> 00:57:02.190 align:start position:0%
today the first person is Chris
kellerer

00:57:02.190 --> 00:57:02.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:16.349 --> 00:57:16.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:19.829 --> 00:57:19.839 align:start position:0%
ker then since we don't seem to be able
 
00:57:22.190 --> 00:57:22.200 align:start position:0%
to make the connection then call upon
 
00:57:28.670 --> 00:57:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:29.990 --> 00:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the opportunity to
 
00:57:32.390 --> 00:57:32.400 align:start position:0%
speak up Mr shair um I'm calling an
 
00:57:37.750 --> 00:57:37.760 align:start position:0%
opposition of this bill um I I have
 
00:57:40.069 --> 00:57:40.079 align:start position:0%
respect for like small businesses and
 
00:57:42.630 --> 00:57:42.640 align:start position:0%
the business our communities but one
 
00:57:45.390 --> 00:57:45.400 align:start position:0%
thing I don't agree is if the business
 
00:57:49.670 --> 00:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
is being um not following the procedures
 
00:57:52.750 --> 00:57:52.760 align:start position:0%
especially during uh emergency orders
 
00:57:54.630 --> 00:57:54.640 align:start position:0%
and an emergency situation like the one
 
00:57:57.190 --> 00:57:57.200 align:start position:0%
we we have right now with the pandemic I
 
00:57:59.549 --> 00:57:59.559 align:start position:0%
don't believe this bill it should be
 
00:58:02.150 --> 00:58:02.160 align:start position:0%
passed because we need we need someone
 
00:58:05.630 --> 00:58:05.640 align:start position:0%
to keep the businesses online like make
 
00:58:08.270 --> 00:58:08.280 align:start position:0%
sure that they follow the procedures um
 
00:58:11.270 --> 00:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
to be honest myself I
 
00:58:14.630 --> 00:58:14.640 align:start position:0%
witness uh some some of the businesses
 
00:58:17.150 --> 00:58:17.160 align:start position:0%
local businesses for instance I went to
 
00:58:19.190 --> 00:58:19.200 align:start position:0%
a gas station and someone didn't wasn't
 
00:58:22.069 --> 00:58:22.079 align:start position:0%
wearing a mask and I was wearing a mask
 
00:58:23.829 --> 00:58:23.839 align:start position:0%
and someone else was wearing a mask and
 
00:58:25.829 --> 00:58:25.839 align:start position:0%
the other person asked the person on the
 
00:58:27.430 --> 00:58:27.440 align:start position:0%
gas station working at the gas station
 
00:58:30.270 --> 00:58:30.280 align:start position:0%
why this person is allowed here without
 
00:58:32.789 --> 00:58:32.799 align:start position:0%
wearing a mask and he say well I'm not
 
00:58:35.589 --> 00:58:35.599 align:start position:0%
going to ask the person to wear a mask
 
00:58:37.430 --> 00:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
how about how about that the rest of the
 
00:58:42.309 --> 00:58:42.319 align:start position:0%
people in that gas station um so we we
 
00:58:44.549 --> 00:58:44.559 align:start position:0%
that person put the rest of the people
 
00:58:47.589 --> 00:58:47.599 align:start position:0%
into rest and then that business can be
 
00:58:50.510 --> 00:58:50.520 align:start position:0%
uh accountable as someone get sick so I
 
00:58:52.190 --> 00:58:52.200 align:start position:0%
I don't believe this bill should be
 
00:58:54.190 --> 00:58:54.200 align:start position:0%
passed because we need to keep the
 
00:58:56.630 --> 00:58:56.640 align:start position:0%
business accountable to make sure that
 
00:58:59.349 --> 00:58:59.359 align:start position:0%
people don't get sick uh in another
 
00:59:01.190 --> 00:59:01.200 align:start position:0%
instance my husband he's an electrician
 
00:59:03.870 --> 00:59:03.880 align:start position:0%
and he works in different areas like
 
00:59:07.029 --> 00:59:07.039 align:start position:0%
commercial uh residential and Industrial
 
00:59:08.589 --> 00:59:08.599 align:start position:0%
and then they always has to wear masks
 
00:59:11.630 --> 00:59:11.640 align:start position:0%
they has to follow the procedures if uh
 
00:59:13.309 --> 00:59:13.319 align:start position:0%
if they don't follow the procedures you
 
00:59:15.349 --> 00:59:15.359 align:start position:0%
know they they they can they can they
 
00:59:17.069 --> 00:59:17.079 align:start position:0%
you know they that that's when the
 
00:59:18.829 --> 00:59:18.839 align:start position:0%
people you know they can get concerned
 
00:59:21.230 --> 00:59:21.240 align:start position:0%
and get a lawsuit but if you follow the
 
00:59:23.190 --> 00:59:23.200 align:start position:0%
procedures I don't think it's necessary
 
00:59:25.829 --> 00:59:25.839 align:start position:0%
to have this law okay thank thank you
 
00:59:27.029 --> 00:59:27.039 align:start position:0%
for your testimony are there any
 
00:59:29.589 --> 00:59:29.599 align:start position:0%
questions for representative
 
00:59:33.349 --> 00:59:33.359 align:start position:0%
Perez seeing none thank you and one more
 
00:59:36.190 --> 00:59:36.200 align:start position:0%
shot for Chris kellerer if Chris
 
00:59:41.750 --> 00:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:46.230 --> 00:59:46.240 align:start position:0%
unmute I don't uh and that that
 
00:59:47.950 --> 00:59:47.960 align:start position:0%
concludes the
 
00:59:47.960 --> 00:59:49.750 align:start position:0%
concludes the
testimony

00:59:49.750 --> 00:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
00:59:51.670 --> 00:59:51.680 align:start position:0%
on House
 
00:59:54.630 --> 00:59:54.640 align:start position:0%
Bill 149 we'll close the hearing on
 
00:59:55.750 --> 00:59:55.760 align:start position:0%

149 we'll move on to the house bill open
 
01:00:02.470 --> 01:00:02.480 align:start position:0%
the hearing on House Bill 402 and I note
 
01:00:05.109 --> 01:00:05.119 align:start position:0%
that no one signed up to speak on House
 
01:00:08.109 --> 01:00:08.119 align:start position:0%

01:00:26.630 --> 01:00:26.640 align:start position:0%
on house go 402 which we're about to

hear there were seven in support and
 
01:00:30.270 --> 01:00:30.280 align:start position:0%
eight in
 
01:00:33.349 --> 01:00:33.359 align:start position:0%
opposition but our own representative
 
01:00:37.230 --> 01:00:37.240 align:start position:0%
Sylvia is the sponsor on House Bill 402
 
01:00:39.109 --> 01:00:39.119 align:start position:0%
and I would call upon representative
 
01:00:41.230 --> 01:00:41.240 align:start position:0%
Sylvia to introduce the bill you would
 
01:00:42.750 --> 01:00:42.760 align:start position:0%
like to do
 
01:00:45.390 --> 01:00:45.400 align:start position:0%
so thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
01:00:48.109 --> 01:00:48.119 align:start position:0%
committee members for uh listening to my
 
01:00:50.870 --> 01:00:50.880 align:start position:0%
brief introduction of this bill we'll
 
01:00:53.549 --> 01:00:53.559 align:start position:0%
get you back on schedule right quickly
 
01:00:58.390 --> 01:00:58.400 align:start position:0%
uh this this bill is very simple and at
 
01:01:00.150 --> 01:01:00.160 align:start position:0%
the same time probably uh considered
 
01:01:01.829 --> 01:01:01.839 align:start position:0%
very extreme by some
 
01:01:01.839 --> 01:01:03.870 align:start position:0%
very extreme by some
folks

01:01:03.870 --> 01:01:03.880 align:start position:0%
folks
 
01:01:06.430 --> 01:01:06.440 align:start position:0%
um this bill
 
01:01:10.990 --> 01:01:11.000 align:start position:0%
simply uh puts a very very high barrier
 
01:01:14.430 --> 01:01:14.440 align:start position:0%
to the takings of property under a state
 
01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:16.150 align:start position:0%
to the takings of property under a state
of

01:01:16.150 --> 01:01:16.160 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:18.470 align:start position:0%
of
emergency

01:01:18.470 --> 01:01:18.480 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
01:01:20.910 --> 01:01:20.920 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that I love about
 
01:01:22.710 --> 01:01:22.720 align:start position:0%
our state
 
01:01:26.069 --> 01:01:26.079 align:start position:0%
constitution is
 
01:01:28.670 --> 01:01:28.680 align:start position:0%
the fact that it was written with the
 
01:01:31.630 --> 01:01:31.640 align:start position:0%
people's rights in part
 
01:01:34.309 --> 01:01:34.319 align:start position:0%
first and before they even
 
01:01:38.109 --> 01:01:38.119 align:start position:0%
considered creating a government they
 
01:01:41.230 --> 01:01:41.240 align:start position:0%
spelled out what the government did not
 
01:01:44.750 --> 01:01:44.760 align:start position:0%
need and that includes all of our rights
 
01:01:47.470 --> 01:01:47.480 align:start position:0%
and particularly
 
01:01:49.430 --> 01:01:49.440 align:start position:0%
uh property
 
01:01:52.190 --> 01:01:52.200 align:start position:0%
rights is the foundation of
 
01:01:55.269 --> 01:01:55.279 align:start position:0%
everything at least in uh
 
01:02:00.109 --> 01:02:00.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:06.789 --> 01:02:06.799 align:start position:0%
um see that way um so this bill
 
01:02:09.549 --> 01:02:09.559 align:start position:0%
requires uh beyond the governor and
 
01:02:12.829 --> 01:02:12.839 align:start position:0%
executive Council it requires the
 
01:02:15.910 --> 01:02:15.920 align:start position:0%
legislature to vote by two-thirds to
 
01:02:17.670 --> 01:02:17.680 align:start position:0%
approve the
 
01:02:22.549 --> 01:02:22.559 align:start position:0%
takings now I did it this way because
 
01:02:27.109 --> 01:02:27.119 align:start position:0%
um outright uh repealing this section of
 
01:02:30.269 --> 01:02:30.279 align:start position:0%
code um would have been perhaps a little
 
01:02:33.230 --> 01:02:33.240 align:start position:0%
more difficult as though this is going
 
01:02:36.589 --> 01:02:36.599 align:start position:0%
to be easy
 
01:02:39.029 --> 01:02:39.039 align:start position:0%
U there are some
 
01:02:43.069 --> 01:02:43.079 align:start position:0%
attachments uh in in other parts of the
 
01:02:46.470 --> 01:02:46.480 align:start position:0%
code that get back to this um and having
 
01:02:49.349 --> 01:02:49.359 align:start position:0%
to do with corpses and real
 
01:02:51.950 --> 01:02:51.960 align:start position:0%
emergencies I think the fact that we
 
01:02:55.990 --> 01:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
went uh 218 years until 2002 to
 
01:02:59.870 --> 01:02:59.880 align:start position:0%
Institute this uh these whole emergency
 
01:03:02.710 --> 01:03:02.720 align:start position:0%
Powers uh speaks to the lack of
 
01:03:04.750 --> 01:03:04.760 align:start position:0%
necessity of any of
 
01:03:09.069 --> 01:03:09.079 align:start position:0%
it and uh frankly I would repeal all of
 
01:03:11.750 --> 01:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
it and we could just go back to pre2
 
01:03:16.990 --> 01:03:17.000 align:start position:0%
2002 and be even more normal so that's
 
01:03:18.950 --> 01:03:18.960 align:start position:0%
that's where I'm at I am an extremist
 
01:03:20.710 --> 01:03:20.720 align:start position:0%
when it comes to our Constitution and
 
01:03:22.470 --> 01:03:22.480 align:start position:0%
the rights of the people need to be
 
01:03:24.349 --> 01:03:24.359 align:start position:0%
defended by government and not in
 
01:03:26.750 --> 01:03:26.760 align:start position:0%
fringed by government thank you very
 
01:03:29.549 --> 01:03:29.559 align:start position:0%
much for listen to My Testimony thank
 
01:03:31.190 --> 01:03:31.200 align:start position:0%
you representative Morgan have a
 
01:03:34.510 --> 01:03:34.520 align:start position:0%
question for representative s Oh indeed
 
01:03:36.910 --> 01:03:36.920 align:start position:0%
I do um were there
 
01:03:39.670 --> 01:03:39.680 align:start position:0%
any takings of real of personal property
 
01:03:42.430 --> 01:03:42.440 align:start position:0%
that happened uh during the crisis of
 
01:03:47.750 --> 01:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
the last year which been would have been
 
01:03:49.789 --> 01:03:49.799 align:start position:0%
needed legislative approval by super
 
01:03:53.430 --> 01:03:53.440 align:start position:0%
majority if uh your bill had been in
 
01:03:56.510 --> 01:03:56.520 align:start position:0%
place uh for
 
01:03:59.750 --> 01:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
2020 I am not aware of any takings uh
 
01:04:03.750 --> 01:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:06.829 --> 01:04:06.839 align:start position:0%
2002 followup yes you
 
01:04:10.470 --> 01:04:10.480 align:start position:0%
may um as a practical matter how would
 
01:04:12.309 --> 01:04:12.319 align:start position:0%
we obtain the ascent of two-thirds of
 
01:04:14.470 --> 01:04:14.480 align:start position:0%
the Senate the House of Representatives
 
01:04:18.069 --> 01:04:18.079 align:start position:0%
um if we had a future crisis which made
 
01:04:21.069 --> 01:04:21.079 align:start position:0%
it unsafe for the legislature to meet in
 
01:04:24.349 --> 01:04:24.359 align:start position:0%
its usual uh in rep Hall and the Senate
 
01:04:26.710 --> 01:04:26.720 align:start position:0%
chamber um which the Senate has solved
 
01:04:29.029 --> 01:04:29.039 align:start position:0%
but we haven't and also what if this
 
01:04:32.190 --> 01:04:32.200 align:start position:0%
happens U when the legislature is not in
 
01:04:36.470 --> 01:04:36.480 align:start position:0%
session thank you well exactly that is
 
01:04:38.910 --> 01:04:38.920 align:start position:0%
perfectly the point of why we should
 
01:04:42.150 --> 01:04:42.160 align:start position:0%
return to pre2 2002 what would have
 
01:04:45.069 --> 01:04:45.079 align:start position:0%
happened pre2 2002 and what would happen
 
01:04:48.390 --> 01:04:48.400 align:start position:0%
in the state of a real emergency
 
01:04:51.990 --> 01:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
and I don't want to diminish the the the
 
01:04:54.990 --> 01:04:55.000 align:start position:0%
deaths that have occurred because of Co
 
01:04:59.910 --> 01:04:59.920 align:start position:0%
but uh you know we have heard testimony
 
01:05:02.510 --> 01:05:02.520 align:start position:0%
of possible real emergencies we won't
 
01:05:04.390 --> 01:05:04.400 align:start position:0%
need to get into gory details of things
 
01:05:06.870 --> 01:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
that would cause perhaps not even the
 
01:05:10.029 --> 01:05:10.039 align:start position:0%
executive Council to be able to meet uh
 
01:05:12.069 --> 01:05:12.079 align:start position:0%
perhaps the governor would be part of
 
01:05:16.230 --> 01:05:16.240 align:start position:0%
the emergency and not be there at all uh
 
01:05:18.870 --> 01:05:18.880 align:start position:0%
these things are not things that we can
 
01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:19.829 align:start position:0%
these things are not things that we can
plan

01:05:19.829 --> 01:05:19.839 align:start position:0%
plan
 
01:05:23.589 --> 01:05:23.599 align:start position:0%
for we can do the best we can and the
 
01:05:25.510 --> 01:05:25.520 align:start position:0%
fact that the matter is the governor
 
01:05:27.829 --> 01:05:27.839 align:start position:0%
will do what the governor is going to do
 
01:05:30.309 --> 01:05:30.319 align:start position:0%
if there's an emergency and that's the
 
01:05:33.750 --> 01:05:33.760 align:start position:0%
kind of leadership we have to accept but
 
01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:34.910 align:start position:0%
kind of leadership we have to accept but
it

01:05:34.910 --> 01:05:34.920 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:05:38.549 --> 01:05:38.559 align:start position:0%
becomes a question after the fact of was
 
01:05:42.510 --> 01:05:42.520 align:start position:0%
it appropriate measures or not and what
 
01:05:46.190 --> 01:05:46.200 align:start position:0%
are the consequences if not
 
01:05:51.349 --> 01:05:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:53.510 --> 01:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
would representative Smith did you have
 
01:05:55.430 --> 01:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
a question
 
01:05:57.829 --> 01:05:57.839 align:start position:0%
yes thank you very much Mr chair uh
 
01:06:01.069 --> 01:06:01.079 align:start position:0%
representative Sylvia I'm trying to
 
01:06:05.589 --> 01:06:05.599 align:start position:0%
follow as I always do um your thinking
 
01:06:08.309 --> 01:06:08.319 align:start position:0%
and I wonder if you could help me
 
01:06:08.319 --> 01:06:10.430 align:start position:0%
and I wonder if you could help me
understand

01:06:10.430 --> 01:06:10.440 align:start position:0%
understand
 
01:06:13.750 --> 01:06:13.760 align:start position:0%
why or how you would differentiate
 
01:06:16.670 --> 01:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
between the Govern the government's
 
01:06:18.710 --> 01:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
taking of
 
01:06:22.430 --> 01:06:22.440 align:start position:0%
property and the government involving
 
01:06:25.230 --> 01:06:25.240 align:start position:0%
itself in
 
01:06:30.029 --> 01:06:30.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:34.470 --> 01:06:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:39.349 --> 01:06:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:42.390 --> 01:06:42.400 align:start position:0%
uh yeah I I I'm I'm afraid I I would
 
01:06:43.990 --> 01:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
have to sit and think on that long and
 
01:06:47.589 --> 01:06:47.599 align:start position:0%
hard that's fine then uh uh representa
 
01:06:50.069 --> 01:06:50.079 align:start position:0%
syvia no one could ask for anything more
 
01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
than each of us thinks think about our
 
01:06:55.910 --> 01:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
positions so I thank you for
 
01:07:00.670 --> 01:07:00.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:03.230 --> 01:07:03.240 align:start position:0%
bur uh thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:07:06.230 --> 01:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question um
 
01:07:08.190 --> 01:07:08.200 align:start position:0%
as I understand
 
01:07:11.190 --> 01:07:11.200 align:start position:0%
already that uh such
 
01:07:13.870 --> 01:07:13.880 align:start position:0%
takings uh with
 
01:07:16.549 --> 01:07:16.559 align:start position:0%
compensation uh already would have to be
 
01:07:18.269 --> 01:07:18.279 align:start position:0%
approved by the governor and the
 
01:07:22.630 --> 01:07:22.640 align:start position:0%
executive councel uh this would add the
 
01:07:24.430 --> 01:07:24.440 align:start position:0%
further approval
 
01:07:28.349 --> 01:07:28.359 align:start position:0%
of a super majority of the legislature
 
01:07:31.390 --> 01:07:31.400 align:start position:0%
given we're talking about an
 
01:07:34.670 --> 01:07:34.680 align:start position:0%
emergency where fast action by
 
01:07:36.789 --> 01:07:36.799 align:start position:0%
definition is
 
01:07:40.829 --> 01:07:40.839 align:start position:0%
required um how do you see that working
 
01:07:44.109 --> 01:07:44.119 align:start position:0%
let's say there's a a flood in in
 
01:07:48.309 --> 01:07:48.319 align:start position:0%
conquered and um there needs to be or or
 
01:07:51.549 --> 01:07:51.559 align:start position:0%
we can go back to seab Brook uh melting
 
01:07:56.029 --> 01:07:56.039 align:start position:0%
down uh and there's a need for the
 
01:07:58.710 --> 01:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
Department of Public Safety to step in
 
01:08:01.510 --> 01:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
and Commander some some property perhaps
 
01:08:04.349 --> 01:08:04.359 align:start position:0%
and the like how do you see that really
 
01:08:05.829 --> 01:08:05.839 align:start position:0%
working in terms of getting the
 
01:08:09.870 --> 01:08:09.880 align:start position:0%
legislature together and debating and
 
01:08:14.269 --> 01:08:14.279 align:start position:0%
voting well I once again I I think it
 
01:08:17.590 --> 01:08:17.600 align:start position:0%
your question really speaks to the flaw
 
01:08:20.789 --> 01:08:20.799 align:start position:0%
in the statute as it sits and why it
 
01:08:24.669 --> 01:08:24.679 align:start position:0%
frankly ought not be there um any of
 
01:08:26.990 --> 01:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
these possible situations that we can
 
01:08:31.430 --> 01:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
dream up might need a reaction within uh
 
01:08:34.950 --> 01:08:34.960 align:start position:0%
an hour and is the the governor and
 
01:08:36.829 --> 01:08:36.839 align:start position:0%
executive Council going to meet within
 
01:08:42.110 --> 01:08:42.120 align:start position:0%
an hour and and take this issue up it's
 
01:08:45.749 --> 01:08:45.759 align:start position:0%
it's not it's not saying uh that the the
 
01:08:48.550 --> 01:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
whole statute just doesn't uh doesn't
 
01:08:50.630 --> 01:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
have any reason to
 
01:08:52.789 --> 01:08:52.799 align:start position:0%
it thank you
 
01:08:58.470 --> 01:08:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:01.149 --> 01:09:01.159 align:start position:0%
Lorenzo thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:09:03.110 --> 01:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
for taking my question representative
 
01:09:05.870 --> 01:09:05.880 align:start position:0%
Sylvia um could you
 
01:09:09.590 --> 01:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
describe what the word taking in this
 
01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:13.149 align:start position:0%
describe what the word taking in this
sentence

01:09:13.149 --> 01:09:13.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:16.829 --> 01:09:16.839 align:start position:0%
means well taking is is
 
01:09:19.950 --> 01:09:19.960 align:start position:0%
uh removing uh someone's property from
 
01:09:24.430 --> 01:09:24.440 align:start position:0%
them um and there are uh a couple of
 
01:09:27.749 --> 01:09:27.759 align:start position:0%
different ways that that happens if we
 
01:09:29.269 --> 01:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
look at the
 
01:09:29.279 --> 01:09:33.510 align:start position:0%
look at the
statute

01:09:33.510 --> 01:09:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:37.030 --> 01:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
um me while I'm searching my
 
01:09:48.870 --> 01:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:52.709 --> 01:09:52.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:52.719 --> 01:09:55.950 align:start position:0%
 
me

01:09:55.950 --> 01:09:55.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:59.990 --> 01:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
so in in the statute it it speaks of
 
01:10:03.270 --> 01:10:03.280 align:start position:0%
taking uh possession of private real
 
01:10:04.590 --> 01:10:04.600 align:start position:0%
estate and
 
01:10:08.390 --> 01:10:08.400 align:start position:0%
improvements or it also speaks of taking
 
01:10:12.070 --> 01:10:12.080 align:start position:0%
title and destroying some possible piece
 
01:10:15.550 --> 01:10:15.560 align:start position:0%
of property so those are a couple of
 
01:10:18.189 --> 01:10:18.199 align:start position:0%
methods of of takings
 
01:10:21.310 --> 01:10:21.320 align:start position:0%
uh possibly temporary or possibly uh
 
01:10:24.630 --> 01:10:24.640 align:start position:0%
forever if you are destroying something
 
01:10:27.350 --> 01:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
so those are a couple of the ways that
 
01:10:30.350 --> 01:10:30.360 align:start position:0%
the takings happen thank
 
01:10:32.350 --> 01:10:32.360 align:start position:0%
you any other questions for
 
01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:34.149 align:start position:0%
you any other questions for
representative

01:10:34.149 --> 01:10:34.159 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:10:36.630 --> 01:10:36.640 align:start position:0%
syvia saying none thank you for your
 
01:10:39.590 --> 01:10:39.600 align:start position:0%

on House Bill 402 if if you do please
 
01:10:52.630 --> 01:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:56.430 --> 01:10:56.440 align:start position:0%
hand see no hands we will close the
 
01:10:59.510 --> 01:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
hearing on house
 
01:11:03.550 --> 01:11:03.560 align:start position:0%
42 the next hearing is House Bill
 
01:11:08.070 --> 01:11:08.080 align:start position:0%
542 I note that 284 people signed up in
 
01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:10.270 align:start position:0%
542 I note that 284 people signed up in
support

01:11:10.270 --> 01:11:10.280 align:start position:0%
support
 
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:14.080 align:start position:0%
79 signed up in opposition but there are
 
01:11:16.830 --> 01:11:16.840 align:start position:0%
22 people who have signed up to
 
01:11:20.669 --> 01:11:20.679 align:start position:0%
speak and so I think what and and as I
 
01:11:22.550 --> 01:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
go down through the list most of them
 
01:11:24.630 --> 01:11:24.640 align:start position:0%
limited their the amount of time that
 
01:11:27.750 --> 01:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
they wanted to speak to uh two minutes
 
01:11:31.830 --> 01:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
or or not at all but um and and a couple
 
01:11:33.830 --> 01:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
did three minutes and I think one person
 
01:11:35.910 --> 01:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
did five minutes but I think I'm going
 
01:11:37.470 --> 01:11:37.480 align:start position:0%
to just limit the testimony to two
 
01:11:39.590 --> 01:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
minutes given the fact that we have so
 
01:11:42.110 --> 01:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
many people who do wish to testify hear
 
01:11:44.750 --> 01:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
from everybody so we will limit the
 
01:11:47.430 --> 01:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
testimony to the two-minute period of
 
01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:49.390 align:start position:0%
testimony to the two-minute period of
time

01:11:49.390 --> 01:11:49.400 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:11:52.229 --> 01:11:52.239 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:12:02.990 --> 01:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:08.149 --> 01:12:08.159 align:start position:0%
of representa is representative Aon and
 
01:12:09.590 --> 01:12:09.600 align:start position:0%

keep it two to two
 
01:12:24.830 --> 01:12:24.840 align:start position:0%
um we we live in an interesting part of
 
01:12:27.149 --> 01:12:27.159 align:start position:0%
the world in New Hampshire and New
 
01:12:29.550 --> 01:12:29.560 align:start position:0%
England because a lot of the original
 
01:12:32.110 --> 01:12:32.120 align:start position:0%
migration from Europe to this part of
 
01:12:35.229 --> 01:12:35.239 align:start position:0%
the world uh was driven by uh this issue
 
01:12:39.229 --> 01:12:39.239 align:start position:0%
of religious freedom and uh so the
 
01:12:41.910 --> 01:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
original bill I'll speak to that first
 
01:12:43.870 --> 01:12:43.880 align:start position:0%
um and then you should have gotten an
 
01:12:46.669 --> 01:12:46.679 align:start position:0%
email yesterday with an amendment that
 
01:12:50.030 --> 01:12:50.040 align:start position:0%
merges uh the original 542 in with the
 
01:12:52.189 --> 01:12:52.199 align:start position:0%
original House Bill
 
01:12:55.149 --> 01:12:55.159 align:start position:0%
440 uh I'm Prime sponsor on
 
01:12:57.830 --> 01:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
542 I'm a co-sponsor on representative
 
01:13:01.070 --> 01:13:01.080 align:start position:0%
kofalt Bill 440 um and I'll get into
 
01:13:04.669 --> 01:13:04.679 align:start position:0%
that those details in a minute but uh
 
01:13:07.709 --> 01:13:07.719 align:start position:0%
whether or not you are a religious
 
01:13:10.030 --> 01:13:10.040 align:start position:0%
person and whether or not you are a
 
01:13:13.229 --> 01:13:13.239 align:start position:0%
practicing religious person you benefit
 
01:13:15.350 --> 01:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
and we all benefit by living in a
 
01:13:18.229 --> 01:13:18.239 align:start position:0%
society that gives wide
 
01:13:21.229 --> 01:13:21.239 align:start position:0%
deference to religion and the issue is
 
01:13:24.470 --> 01:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
not religion the issue is your freedom
 
01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:25.390 align:start position:0%
not religion the issue is your freedom
of

01:13:25.390 --> 01:13:25.400 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:13:27.750 --> 01:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
conscience that's really the issue and
 
01:13:29.870 --> 01:13:29.880 align:start position:0%
that that can uh that freedom can
 
01:13:32.550 --> 01:13:32.560 align:start position:0%
include believing in a deity believing
 
01:13:36.590 --> 01:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
in no deity uh or having uh different
 
01:13:41.390 --> 01:13:41.400 align:start position:0%
beliefs and the state stays clear of
 
01:13:45.189 --> 01:13:45.199 align:start position:0%
your internal uh belief system when it
 
01:13:48.470 --> 01:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
comes to uh religion the label we give
 
01:13:49.950 --> 01:13:49.960 align:start position:0%
this for
 
01:13:53.790 --> 01:13:53.800 align:start position:0%
religion um societies that where the
 
01:13:57.149 --> 01:13:57.159 align:start position:0%
government imposes restrictions on
 
01:14:00.270 --> 01:14:00.280 align:start position:0%
religion tend to be authoritarian uh
 
01:14:03.550 --> 01:14:03.560 align:start position:0%
societies government uh somehow
 
01:14:05.870 --> 01:14:05.880 align:start position:0%
government sees the concept of God as a
 
01:14:08.390 --> 01:14:08.400 align:start position:0%
competing idea and tries to crush it or
 
01:14:10.270 --> 01:14:10.280 align:start position:0%
tries to keep it
 
01:14:12.990 --> 01:14:13.000 align:start position:0%
constrained um and you see that in uh
 
01:14:14.750 --> 01:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
you know communist China where they're
 
01:14:16.350 --> 01:14:16.360 align:start position:0%
taking down crosses on churches or
 
01:14:18.310 --> 01:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
they're forcing churches to put a
 
01:14:20.229 --> 01:14:20.239 align:start position:0%
picture of Ma in the back of the church
 
01:14:22.110 --> 01:14:22.120 align:start position:0%
or they're rewriting the Bible so that
 
01:14:23.990 --> 01:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
it fits with commun
 
01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:25.629 align:start position:0%
it fits with commun
um

01:14:25.629 --> 01:14:25.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:29.470 --> 01:14:29.480 align:start position:0%
Doctrine so when the state of emergency
 
01:14:32.629 --> 01:14:32.639 align:start position:0%
took place here in New Hampshire we had
 
01:14:34.030 --> 01:14:34.040 align:start position:0%
an interesting
 
01:14:36.310 --> 01:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
situation that I think is unprecedented
 
01:14:38.070 --> 01:14:38.080 align:start position:0%
I don't know if it's happened before in
 
01:14:40.310 --> 01:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire or even in our country and
 
01:14:42.629 --> 01:14:42.639 align:start position:0%
that's when the government uh for a
 
01:14:45.070 --> 01:14:45.080 align:start position:0%
period of time period of uncertainty uh
 
01:14:46.189 --> 01:14:46.199 align:start position:0%
shut down
 
01:14:49.750 --> 01:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
churches and so that was a uh an
 
01:14:52.270 --> 01:14:52.280 align:start position:0%
interesting moment in time and that
 
01:14:53.750 --> 01:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
prompted the original idea a for House
 
01:14:53.760 --> 01:14:55.070 align:start position:0%
prompted the original idea a for House
Bill

01:14:55.070 --> 01:14:55.080 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
01:14:59.990 --> 01:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
542 to make sure that uh houses of
 
01:15:05.149 --> 01:15:05.159 align:start position:0%
worship had had their uh their deserved
 
01:15:10.629 --> 01:15:10.639 align:start position:0%
carv out in the state of emergency uh
 
01:15:14.350 --> 01:15:14.360 align:start position:0%
rsas so you see that in House Bill
 
01:15:18.629 --> 01:15:18.639 align:start position:0%
544 or 542 I'm sorry uh and that's uh
 
01:15:21.550 --> 01:15:21.560 align:start position:0%
line 10 on the on the original Bill to
 
01:15:22.790 --> 01:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
guarantee the free exercise of religion
 
01:15:23.830 --> 01:15:23.840 align:start position:0%
the right of people to peacefully
 
01:15:25.629 --> 01:15:25.639 align:start position:0%
assemble and talks about the first
 
01:15:28.669 --> 01:15:28.679 align:start position:0%
amendment in the Constitution and uh
 
01:15:30.790 --> 01:15:30.800 align:start position:0%
Article 5 part one Article 5 in the New
 
01:15:32.950 --> 01:15:32.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution which contain the
 
01:15:34.550 --> 01:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
free exercise
 
01:15:37.350 --> 01:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
clause uh I could probably go on a lot
 
01:15:39.629 --> 01:15:39.639 align:start position:0%
more than uh two minutes so I'm gonna
 
01:15:41.229 --> 01:15:41.239 align:start position:0%
skip over some of the things I'd like to
 
01:15:45.550 --> 01:15:45.560 align:start position:0%
say um we already have so I have okay
 
01:15:48.510 --> 01:15:48.520 align:start position:0%
I'll try to wrap it up it's a big topic
 
01:15:51.950 --> 01:15:51.960 align:start position:0%
so the amendment Amendment
 
01:15:55.910 --> 01:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
0623 take takes the original 440 Bill
 
01:16:00.390 --> 01:16:00.400 align:start position:0%
and combines it with 542 so the original
 
01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:01.390 align:start position:0%
and combines it with 542 so the original
542

01:16:01.390 --> 01:16:01.400 align:start position:0%
542
 
01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:03.830 align:start position:0%
542
[Music]

01:16:03.830 --> 01:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:16:06.830 --> 01:16:06.840 align:start position:0%
um can be
 
01:16:09.189 --> 01:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
found on page
 
01:16:11.390 --> 01:16:11.400 align:start position:0%
four line
 
01:16:14.590 --> 01:16:14.600 align:start position:0%
24 so that's the kernel of the original
 
01:16:17.270 --> 01:16:17.280 align:start position:0%
542 the rest of the language is from the
 
01:16:21.110 --> 01:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
original 440 bill and if you recall back
 
01:16:23.470 --> 01:16:23.480 align:start position:0%
when there was testimony on 440 with
 
01:16:26.590 --> 01:16:26.600 align:start position:0%
representative Kofa uh he put that bill
 
01:16:28.510 --> 01:16:28.520 align:start position:0%
in before the Mac decision that came
 
01:16:30.430 --> 01:16:30.440 align:start position:0%
from the US Supreme Court that dealt
 
01:16:32.950 --> 01:16:32.960 align:start position:0%
with the exercise of free or the free
 
01:16:37.229 --> 01:16:37.239 align:start position:0%
exercise of religion and it it gave a uh
 
01:16:39.030 --> 01:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
a strong statement on what New
 
01:16:40.830 --> 01:16:40.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's free exercise clause means
 
01:16:42.149 --> 01:16:42.159 align:start position:0%
and that it's much stricter than what
 
01:16:46.229 --> 01:16:46.239 align:start position:0%
the federal government's Clause means
 
01:16:48.430 --> 01:16:48.440 align:start position:0%
so that bill was
 
01:16:51.590 --> 01:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
removed and that that bill was amended
 
01:16:53.229 --> 01:16:53.239 align:start position:0%
but there's there's been discussions
 
01:16:55.270 --> 01:16:55.280 align:start position:0%
that we should codify the Mac decision
 
01:16:57.750 --> 01:16:57.760 align:start position:0%
in state law and that's what the
 
01:17:02.310 --> 01:17:02.320 align:start position:0%
original 440 did so that's the the uh
 
01:17:04.030 --> 01:17:04.040 align:start position:0%
the impetus behind the amendment is to
 
01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:05.270 align:start position:0%
the impetus behind the amendment is to
combine

01:17:05.270 --> 01:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
combine
 
01:17:09.229 --> 01:17:09.239 align:start position:0%
542 protecting religious exercise uh
 
01:17:11.510 --> 01:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
during state of emergency combining it
 
01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:12.550 align:start position:0%
during state of emergency combining it
with

01:17:12.550 --> 01:17:12.560 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:17:15.709 --> 01:17:15.719 align:start position:0%
440 they're completely related subjects
 
01:17:18.790 --> 01:17:18.800 align:start position:0%
so that we put the Mac decision statute
 
01:17:21.470 --> 01:17:21.480 align:start position:0%
already spoken about four minutes here
 
01:17:23.910 --> 01:17:23.920 align:start position:0%
so if you could just wrap up that would
 
01:17:23.920 --> 01:17:25.390 align:start position:0%
so if you could just wrap up that would
be

01:17:25.390 --> 01:17:25.400 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:17:28.870 --> 01:17:28.880 align:start position:0%
appreciated well set okay rep
 
01:17:31.910 --> 01:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
representative Horan did you have a
 
01:17:36.910 --> 01:17:36.920 align:start position:0%
question yes I just wondering um is
 
01:17:38.790 --> 01:17:38.800 align:start position:0%
there constitutional issue here on
 
01:17:41.470 --> 01:17:41.480 align:start position:0%
giving privileges to overtly religious
 
01:17:44.470 --> 01:17:44.480 align:start position:0%
organizations as opposed to other uh
 
01:17:47.229 --> 01:17:47.239 align:start position:0%
other organizations like atheist groups
 
01:17:49.510 --> 01:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
or let's say just hypothetically I had a
 
01:17:51.110 --> 01:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
study group which gets together every
 
01:17:54.910 --> 01:17:54.920 align:start position:0%
week to study critical race Theory um so
 
01:17:59.830 --> 01:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
would you uh so is that a you feel that
 
01:18:01.910 --> 01:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
maybe something NE so do you have a
 
01:18:04.070 --> 01:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
problem with the bill is written um
 
01:18:07.030 --> 01:18:07.040 align:start position:0%
carving out religious groups from other
 
01:18:10.110 --> 01:18:10.120 align:start position:0%
uh other people discussing sort
 
01:18:12.629 --> 01:18:12.639 align:start position:0%
non-religious Phil philosophical topics
 
01:18:14.070 --> 01:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
you know thank
 
01:18:16.750 --> 01:18:16.760 align:start position:0%
you uh if you consider your study group
 
01:18:19.390 --> 01:18:19.400 align:start position:0%
or religion then I think maybe it might
 
01:18:21.950 --> 01:18:21.960 align:start position:0%
apply but if it's a academic study group
 
01:18:24.550 --> 01:18:24.560 align:start position:0%
then you that would be a different realm
 
01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:25.990 align:start position:0%
then you that would be a different realm
Over

01:18:25.990 --> 01:18:26.000 align:start position:0%
Over
 
01:18:28.990 --> 01:18:29.000 align:start position:0%
Law representative
 
01:18:31.110 --> 01:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
Alexander um thank you Mr chair thank
 
01:18:33.750 --> 01:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
you represent Ammon um my question is
 
01:18:37.470 --> 01:18:37.480 align:start position:0%
regarding um like ways people can abuse
 
01:18:40.950 --> 01:18:40.960 align:start position:0%
this um if it's enacted so um say over
 
01:18:42.430 --> 01:18:42.440 align:start position:0%
the summer I decide I want to have a
 
01:18:43.990 --> 01:18:44.000 align:start position:0%
barbecue with a bunch of my friends
 
01:18:46.189 --> 01:18:46.199 align:start position:0%
during a state of emergency and you know
 
01:18:49.189 --> 01:18:49.199 align:start position:0%
I have a bunch of people over my house
 
01:18:51.470 --> 01:18:51.480 align:start position:0%
um and we read you know a verse of the
 
01:18:53.550 --> 01:18:53.560 align:start position:0%
Bible would that would that
 
01:18:56.870 --> 01:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
qualify as a um like an opportunity for
 
01:18:58.870 --> 01:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
free assembly if I you know we just
 
01:19:00.910 --> 01:19:00.920 align:start position:0%
maybe read one or two verses then
 
01:19:02.790 --> 01:19:02.800 align:start position:0%
continue on with our
 
01:19:05.229 --> 01:19:05.239 align:start position:0%
day could you elaborate on that scenario
 
01:19:07.870 --> 01:19:07.880 align:start position:0%
I mean what what kind of enforcement
 
01:19:10.550 --> 01:19:10.560 align:start position:0%
would you expect to happen in that
 
01:19:12.669 --> 01:19:12.679 align:start position:0%
situation I guess I guess that's my
 
01:19:15.229 --> 01:19:15.239 align:start position:0%
question is is could this could this be
 
01:19:17.430 --> 01:19:17.440 align:start position:0%
construed or abused um you know in a
 
01:19:21.350 --> 01:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
situation like that so that would apply
 
01:19:23.590 --> 01:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
to narrow Tailoring so if you look at
 
01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:24.830 align:start position:0%
to narrow Tailoring so if you look at
the

01:19:24.830 --> 01:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:19:30.030 --> 01:19:30.040 align:start position:0%
bill uh it's page 4 line 12 and
 
01:19:32.189 --> 01:19:32.199 align:start position:0%
13 so that would be the test that the
 
01:19:33.669 --> 01:19:33.679 align:start position:0%
government would apply to what you're
 
01:19:33.679 --> 01:19:35.709 align:start position:0%
government would apply to what you're
doing

01:19:35.709 --> 01:19:35.719 align:start position:0%
doing
 
01:19:38.390 --> 01:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
um and it you know is is there an
 
01:19:41.189 --> 01:19:41.199 align:start position:0%
essential and uh compelling interest of
 
01:19:43.510 --> 01:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
the government and what is the least
 
01:19:44.990 --> 01:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
restrictive means of furthering that
 
01:19:47.669 --> 01:19:47.679 align:start position:0%
compelling interest so you know if
 
01:19:49.430 --> 01:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
you're actually having a Bible study
 
01:19:50.990 --> 01:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
that might happen to have a barbecue at
 
01:19:53.590 --> 01:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
the end uh it the government would have
 
01:19:56.709 --> 01:19:56.719 align:start position:0%
to use the least restrictive means to
 
01:19:59.350 --> 01:19:59.360 align:start position:0%
enable your free exercise of
 
01:20:01.870 --> 01:20:01.880 align:start position:0%
religion that's very helpful thank you
 
01:20:01.880 --> 01:20:02.590 align:start position:0%

GRE Jeffrey
 
01:22:44.470 --> 01:22:44.480 align:start position:0%
gree good morning Mr chairman and
 
01:22:46.390 --> 01:22:46.400 align:start position:0%
members of the Judiciary Committee I'm
 
01:22:48.830 --> 01:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
representative Jeff gson of Wentworth I
 
01:22:51.110 --> 01:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
would gladly add my name as a co-sponsor
 
01:22:52.990 --> 01:22:53.000 align:start position:0%
of this bill if I could so thank you for
 
01:22:54.390 --> 01:22:54.400 align:start position:0%
allowing me a couple of minutes to
 
01:22:58.350 --> 01:22:58.360 align:start position:0%
express my support in House Bill 542 the
 
01:22:59.590 --> 01:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
events of the past year have
 
01:23:01.149 --> 01:23:01.159 align:start position:0%
demonstrated that government tends
 
01:23:03.550 --> 01:23:03.560 align:start position:0%
toward expansion and abuse of its powers
 
01:23:05.390 --> 01:23:05.400 align:start position:0%
and will infringe on people's rights if
 
01:23:07.790 --> 01:23:07.800 align:start position:0%
it is not constantly held in check and
 
01:23:10.070 --> 01:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
if we allow government to use the excuse
 
01:23:12.629 --> 01:23:12.639 align:start position:0%
of an emergency to infringe upon rights
 
01:23:15.229 --> 01:23:15.239 align:start position:0%
than emergencies they will give us I
 
01:23:16.990 --> 01:23:17.000 align:start position:0%
personally know three pastors who
 
01:23:18.830 --> 01:23:18.840 align:start position:0%
directly face such infringements in the
 
01:23:21.470 --> 01:23:21.480 align:start position:0%
past year one of whom was fined
 
01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:23.350 align:start position:0%
past year one of whom was fined
$112,000

01:23:23.350 --> 01:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
$112,000
 
01:23:25.390 --> 01:23:25.400 align:start position:0%
it didn't matter that people remained in
 
01:23:27.590 --> 01:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
their cars it didn't matter if Services
 
01:23:29.830 --> 01:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
were being held outside it didn't matter
 
01:23:31.629 --> 01:23:31.639 align:start position:0%
that reasonable care was being taken to
 
01:23:33.910 --> 01:23:33.920 align:start position:0%
protect people inside and out there was
 
01:23:36.709 --> 01:23:36.719 align:start position:0%
an attempt by government to shut down
 
01:23:38.950 --> 01:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
god-given constitutionally protected
 
01:23:41.350 --> 01:23:41.360 align:start position:0%
rights in the name of an emergency and
 
01:23:43.229 --> 01:23:43.239 align:start position:0%
it was one of the very first actions
 
01:23:45.750 --> 01:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
taken by government going as far as to
 
01:23:48.070 --> 01:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
label Church attendance as super
 
01:23:50.870 --> 01:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
spreader events thus stoking fear and
 
01:23:53.070 --> 01:23:53.080 align:start position:0%
panic and bigotry against those who
 
01:23:55.510 --> 01:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
would attend church services in person
 
01:23:57.430 --> 01:23:57.440 align:start position:0%
these pastors were not uh excuse me
 
01:23:59.229 --> 01:23:59.239 align:start position:0%
these pastors were put in a situation
 
01:24:01.750 --> 01:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
that no Pastor or Christian or anybody
 
01:24:04.270 --> 01:24:04.280 align:start position:0%
wants to be in having to decide between
 
01:24:06.950 --> 01:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
obeying government or obeying God their
 
01:24:08.950 --> 01:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
decisions were not made with any malice
 
01:24:10.669 --> 01:24:10.679 align:start position:0%
and there was they were prepared for the
 
01:24:12.750 --> 01:24:12.760 align:start position:0%
consequences but the decision of the
 
01:24:14.950 --> 01:24:14.960 align:start position:0%
government to go after these pastors was
 
01:24:17.790 --> 01:24:17.800 align:start position:0%
arbitrary capricious and abusive because
 
01:24:20.270 --> 01:24:20.280 align:start position:0%
no police was ever sent to the local
 
01:24:23.270 --> 01:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
Walmarts or Home Depot that routinely
 
01:24:26.110 --> 01:24:26.120 align:start position:0%
have larger attendance indoors than
 
01:24:28.750 --> 01:24:28.760 align:start position:0%
these churches and liquor stores
 
01:24:31.709 --> 01:24:31.719 align:start position:0%
remained open no government should be so
 
01:24:34.189 --> 01:24:34.199 align:start position:0%
comfortable wanly trampling on people's
 
01:24:36.470 --> 01:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
rights even under the guise of an
 
01:24:38.590 --> 01:24:38.600 align:start position:0%
emergency the Constitution does not
 
01:24:40.669 --> 01:24:40.679 align:start position:0%
limit what the people can do it limits
 
01:24:43.189 --> 01:24:43.199 align:start position:0%
what the government can do including
 
01:24:46.109 --> 01:24:46.119 align:start position:0%
during emergencies we should not need
 
01:24:48.750 --> 01:24:48.760 align:start position:0%
this law but we do the courts got it
 
01:24:50.590 --> 01:24:50.600 align:start position:0%
right this time in reminding Governors
 
01:24:52.390 --> 01:24:52.400 align:start position:0%
and other officials about religious
 
01:24:54.350 --> 01:24:54.360 align:start position:0%
freedom but the meanings of the words of
 
01:24:55.910 --> 01:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
the US and the New Hampshire
 
01:24:57.790 --> 01:24:57.800 align:start position:0%
Constitution and other state
 
01:24:59.470 --> 01:24:59.480 align:start position:0%
constitutions have become increasingly
 
01:25:01.709 --> 01:25:01.719 align:start position:0%
more vague and the citizens of this
 
01:25:03.510 --> 01:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
country have been found to not have
 
01:25:05.750 --> 01:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
standing in our own courts with greater
 
01:25:08.709 --> 01:25:08.719 align:start position:0%
frequency next time is not worth the
 
01:25:11.709 --> 01:25:11.719 align:start position:0%
risk region is found in the in the First
 
01:25:13.550 --> 01:25:13.560 align:start position:0%
Amendment because it is one of the first
 
01:25:15.189 --> 01:25:15.199 align:start position:0%
things that tyrannical governments take
 
01:25:17.870 --> 01:25:17.880 align:start position:0%
away so please send House Bill 542 to
 
01:25:20.149 --> 01:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
the floor with a unanimous OTP
 
01:25:22.510 --> 01:25:22.520 align:start position:0%
recommendation so that regardless of of
 
01:25:25.470 --> 01:25:25.480 align:start position:0%
your faith lack of faith you'll be free
 
01:25:27.629 --> 01:25:27.639 align:start position:0%
to exercise it without infringement even
 
01:25:30.870 --> 01:25:30.880 align:start position:0%
during an emergency thank you thank you
 
01:25:33.629 --> 01:25:33.639 align:start position:0%
represent Horgan did you have a question
 
01:25:36.830 --> 01:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
oh I I guess so yes um you mentioned the
 
01:25:38.590 --> 01:25:38.600 align:start position:0%
pastor who was fined even though he had
 
01:25:41.149 --> 01:25:41.159 align:start position:0%
a drive-in service
 
01:25:44.990 --> 01:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
and that particular story but was that
 
01:25:47.270 --> 01:25:47.280 align:start position:0%
Pastor taking the precautions that he
 
01:25:51.629 --> 01:25:51.639 align:start position:0%
did um simply out of fear of uh fear of
 
01:25:52.990 --> 01:25:53.000 align:start position:0%
the government or was he doing it
 
01:25:54.990 --> 01:25:55.000 align:start position:0%
primarily out of fear of the of the
 
01:25:56.669 --> 01:25:56.679 align:start position:0%
pandemic and
 
01:25:59.870 --> 01:25:59.880 align:start position:0%
I the pastor's name is Charles Hamilton
 
01:26:01.750 --> 01:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
at King James Bible Baptist Church in
 
01:26:03.470 --> 01:26:03.480 align:start position:0%
Greenville Mississippi he's actually a
 
01:26:07.030 --> 01:26:07.040 align:start position:0%
personal friend of mine and in in trying
 
01:26:11.430 --> 01:26:11.440 align:start position:0%
to accommodate all of the uh uh the
 
01:26:14.350 --> 01:26:14.360 align:start position:0%
guidelines trying to follow uh what
 
01:26:17.430 --> 01:26:17.440 align:start position:0%
would be considered reasonable protocols
 
01:26:20.149 --> 01:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
uh Pastor Hamilton decided to hold a
 
01:26:22.709 --> 01:26:22.719 align:start position:0%
drive-in church service this was right
 
01:26:25.910 --> 01:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of all of this and uh
 
01:26:29.470 --> 01:26:29.480 align:start position:0%
and and yet 20 police cars showed up at
 
01:26:31.629 --> 01:26:31.639 align:start position:0%
Pastor Hamilton's church that means 20
 
01:26:33.950 --> 01:26:33.960 align:start position:0%
police officers were not out uh
 
01:26:36.550 --> 01:26:36.560 align:start position:0%
arresting rapists and murderers no they
 
01:26:38.709 --> 01:26:38.719 align:start position:0%
were finding every person who attended
 
01:26:42.109 --> 01:26:42.119 align:start position:0%
the outdoor Drive-In church service
 
01:26:45.830 --> 01:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
$500 including Pastor Hamilton so that's
 
01:26:48.629 --> 01:26:48.639 align:start position:0%
the kind of abuse that uh that pastors
 
01:26:51.189 --> 01:26:51.199 align:start position:0%
faced thank
 
01:26:51.199 --> 01:26:54.750 align:start position:0%
faced thank
you

01:26:54.750 --> 01:26:54.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:58.189 --> 01:26:58.199 align:start position:0%
this any other questions
 
01:27:00.310 --> 01:27:00.320 align:start position:0%
represent any similar in in New
 
01:27:05.590 --> 01:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:08.390 --> 01:27:08.400 align:start position:0%
you I'm sorry rip in Horan I didn't if
 
01:27:09.870 --> 01:27:09.880 align:start position:0%
you asked me a question I didn't hear it
 
01:27:11.669 --> 01:27:11.679 align:start position:0%
were there any were there any similar
 
01:27:14.709 --> 01:27:14.719 align:start position:0%
incidents in New Hampshire um I mean I I
 
01:27:16.270 --> 01:27:16.280 align:start position:0%
can look up the King James Bible
 
01:27:18.310 --> 01:27:18.320 align:start position:0%
incident I don't know how many people
 
01:27:21.470 --> 01:27:21.480 align:start position:0%
were there 20 police cars may have been
 
01:27:23.189 --> 01:27:23.199 align:start position:0%
it may have been reasonable unreasonable
 
01:27:25.030 --> 01:27:25.040 align:start position:0%
depending on the size of the crowd and
 
01:27:26.830 --> 01:27:26.840 align:start position:0%
um the size of the place where they were
 
01:27:29.390 --> 01:27:29.400 align:start position:0%
assembling but I mean we had uh almost
 
01:27:32.910 --> 01:27:32.920 align:start position:0%
that many we had probably about we had
 
01:27:34.669 --> 01:27:34.679 align:start position:0%
like a number of police officers
 
01:27:36.910 --> 01:27:36.920 align:start position:0%
probably that many just for our driving
 
01:27:38.510 --> 01:27:38.520 align:start position:0%
just for our house session um including
 
01:27:40.149 --> 01:27:40.159 align:start position:0%
the drive-in session that we ourselves
 
01:27:42.070 --> 01:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
had in my town of dur if you're
 
01:27:44.310 --> 01:27:44.320 align:start position:0%
comfortable sending 20 police officers
 
01:27:46.550 --> 01:27:46.560 align:start position:0%
to to to to a
 
01:27:48.790 --> 01:27:48.800 align:start position:0%
church I I don't know what to say about
 
01:27:51.550 --> 01:27:51.560 align:start position:0%
that but in the state of New Hampshire I
 
01:27:53.750 --> 01:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
am not a aware of any uh pastors that
 
01:27:56.070 --> 01:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
were find anything because our governor
 
01:27:59.189 --> 01:27:59.199 align:start position:0%
uh responded very quickly after uh a lot
 
01:28:01.550 --> 01:28:01.560 align:start position:0%
of this started making national news and
 
01:28:03.709 --> 01:28:03.719 align:start position:0%
we went from having to be completely
 
01:28:05.750 --> 01:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
shut down to well at least we could open
 
01:28:08.149 --> 01:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
and have 10 people in service so the
 
01:28:09.790 --> 01:28:09.800 align:start position:0%
governor responded rather quickly before
 
01:28:11.669 --> 01:28:11.679 align:start position:0%
he could be
 
01:28:15.470 --> 01:28:15.480 align:start position:0%
sued thank you follow up you probably
 
01:28:19.590 --> 01:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
followup so one last okay so that okay I
 
01:28:21.030 --> 01:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
can't speak to the government state of
 
01:28:22.950 --> 01:28:22.960 align:start position:0%
mind you
 
01:28:25.790 --> 01:28:25.800 align:start position:0%
do you favor uh treating um religious
 
01:28:27.229 --> 01:28:27.239 align:start position:0%
organizations and then perhaps
 
01:28:28.870 --> 01:28:28.880 align:start position:0%
non-religious organizations that wish to
 
01:28:32.070 --> 01:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
have meetings um uh differently in the
 
01:28:34.790 --> 01:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
law or do you think maybe we should prer
 
01:28:36.590 --> 01:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
modifying it to bring in a wider range
 
01:28:39.750 --> 01:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
of organizations so well if I'm reading
 
01:28:41.430 --> 01:28:41.440 align:start position:0%
the First Amendment of the US
 
01:28:44.270 --> 01:28:44.280 align:start position:0%
Constitution the uh freedom of religion
 
01:28:47.430 --> 01:28:47.440 align:start position:0%
is expressly stated and so there it's
 
01:28:49.189 --> 01:28:49.199 align:start position:0%
not like we have to carve out anything
 
01:28:50.669 --> 01:28:50.679 align:start position:0%
special for Religious Freedom it's
 
01:28:54.550 --> 01:28:54.560 align:start position:0%
already there now as far as any uh other
 
01:28:57.390 --> 01:28:57.400 align:start position:0%
uh philanthropic organization or
 
01:28:59.229 --> 01:28:59.239 align:start position:0%
philosophical organization if you get
 
01:29:00.790 --> 01:29:00.800 align:start position:0%
yourself declared a religion then you
 
01:29:03.109 --> 01:29:03.119 align:start position:0%
would fall under that atheists have been
 
01:29:05.709 --> 01:29:05.719 align:start position:0%
determined to be uh be a religion as
 
01:29:08.149 --> 01:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
well so atheists can get together under
 
01:29:10.270 --> 01:29:10.280 align:start position:0%
the religious freedom so it's a it's a
 
01:29:12.990 --> 01:29:13.000 align:start position:0%
all for one if it's a religion uh but
 
01:29:16.109 --> 01:29:16.119 align:start position:0%
the uh it's it's already carved out
 
01:29:17.990 --> 01:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
that's why I said that this V this bill
 
01:29:20.430 --> 01:29:20.440 align:start position:0%
is actually should not even be necessary
 
01:29:22.350 --> 01:29:22.360 align:start position:0%
but it actually is necessary because
 
01:29:25.109 --> 01:29:25.119 align:start position:0%
government keeps uh Towing the line or
 
01:29:27.990 --> 01:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
overstepping it thank you are there any
 
01:29:31.030 --> 01:29:31.040 align:start position:0%
other questions for representive
 
01:29:33.350 --> 01:29:33.360 align:start position:0%
G seeing none thank you for your
 
01:29:36.109 --> 01:29:36.119 align:start position:0%
testimony today thank you very
 
01:29:43.990 --> 01:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:46.109 --> 01:29:46.119 align:start position:0%
huitt good morning Mr chairman can you
 
01:29:49.510 --> 01:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
hear me we can I thank you thank you
 
01:29:51.950 --> 01:29:51.960 align:start position:0%
I'll just respond to a few of the points
 
01:29:53.590 --> 01:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
that have been made already and then
 
01:29:56.070 --> 01:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
I'll take any legal questions um I guess
 
01:29:58.350 --> 01:29:58.360 align:start position:0%
I'll respond first to representative
 
01:30:00.629 --> 01:30:00.639 align:start position:0%
Horan's last point about um there not
 
01:30:02.629 --> 01:30:02.639 align:start position:0%
being any fines uh of churches in New
 
01:30:04.030 --> 01:30:04.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that's true there have been no
 
01:30:06.270 --> 01:30:06.280 align:start position:0%
fines um I think this is first and
 
01:30:08.629 --> 01:30:08.639 align:start position:0%
foremost a preventative measure um in
 
01:30:10.550 --> 01:30:10.560 align:start position:0%
light of what we've seen in other states
 
01:30:12.350 --> 01:30:12.360 align:start position:0%
it's appropriate for the legislature to
 
01:30:13.830 --> 01:30:13.840 align:start position:0%
think ahead about problems that might
 
01:30:15.350 --> 01:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
arise in the future just based on what
 
01:30:17.030 --> 01:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
we observe and and try to fix those
 
01:30:19.669 --> 01:30:19.679 align:start position:0%
problems before they come up I will say
 
01:30:22.270 --> 01:30:22.280 align:start position:0%
that Governor sununu's executive orders
 
01:30:25.270 --> 01:30:25.280 align:start position:0%
did initially have Provisions um which
 
01:30:27.149 --> 01:30:27.159 align:start position:0%
did treat churches more restrictively
 
01:30:29.310 --> 01:30:29.320 align:start position:0%
than other similarly situated kinds of
 
01:30:32.109 --> 01:30:32.119 align:start position:0%
entities um but fortunately before those
 
01:30:34.430 --> 01:30:34.440 align:start position:0%
Provisions could be applied to anyone or
 
01:30:36.350 --> 01:30:36.360 align:start position:0%
enforced uh it was brought to the
 
01:30:38.149 --> 01:30:38.159 align:start position:0%
governor's attention that those
 
01:30:40.270 --> 01:30:40.280 align:start position:0%
Provisions were likely unconstitutional
 
01:30:41.510 --> 01:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
um and the governor and his office
 
01:30:43.229 --> 01:30:43.239 align:start position:0%
recognized that and removed those
 
01:30:45.750 --> 01:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
Provisions so it is just something of a
 
01:30:48.990 --> 01:30:49.000 align:start position:0%
natural tendency of state governments um
 
01:30:50.390 --> 01:30:50.400 align:start position:0%
especially in in a state like New
 
01:30:52.310 --> 01:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire which is more secular to just
 
01:30:55.149 --> 01:30:55.159 align:start position:0%
not deem churches to be particularly
 
01:30:56.790 --> 01:30:56.800 align:start position:0%
important and that's an important reason
 
01:30:59.109 --> 01:30:59.119 align:start position:0%
to have a protection like this in in
 
01:31:01.430 --> 01:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
State Statute um the next Governor might
 
01:31:03.709 --> 01:31:03.719 align:start position:0%
not be as Forward Thinking um or as
 
01:31:06.709 --> 01:31:06.719 align:start position:0%
benevolent as as governor cunu was far
 
01:31:08.350 --> 01:31:08.360 align:start position:0%
as this has come up a couple times the
 
01:31:10.830 --> 01:31:10.840 align:start position:0%
idea of special protections for religion
 
01:31:13.910 --> 01:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
and not other groups I think that both
 
01:31:15.990 --> 01:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
the Federal Constitution and our state
 
01:31:18.310 --> 01:31:18.320 align:start position:0%
constitution make that value judgment
 
01:31:19.629 --> 01:31:19.639 align:start position:0%
that religion warrants special
 
01:31:21.229 --> 01:31:21.239 align:start position:0%
protections there's special free
 
01:31:24.310 --> 01:31:24.320 align:start position:0%
exercise Clauses in both um there's not
 
01:31:26.070 --> 01:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
special protections for labor
 
01:31:28.550 --> 01:31:28.560 align:start position:0%
organizations or other kinds of groups
 
01:31:30.669 --> 01:31:30.679 align:start position:0%
um because of the particular importance
 
01:31:33.709 --> 01:31:33.719 align:start position:0%
of the topic of religion and we see this
 
01:31:35.830 --> 01:31:35.840 align:start position:0%
already in existing law in in the
 
01:31:38.350 --> 01:31:38.360 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court case Hosanna Tabor for
 
01:31:40.390 --> 01:31:40.400 align:start position:0%
example which was 2012 the US Supreme
 
01:31:41.910 --> 01:31:41.920 align:start position:0%
Court held there's a ministerial
 
01:31:44.189 --> 01:31:44.199 align:start position:0%
exception the government flat out can
 
01:31:46.510 --> 01:31:46.520 align:start position:0%
never tell churches um what ministers to
 
01:31:48.390 --> 01:31:48.400 align:start position:0%
hire and fire that's just not true of
 
01:31:51.750 --> 01:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
other kinds of organizations um so this
 
01:31:54.270 --> 01:31:54.280 align:start position:0%
statute I think just reflects that value
 
01:31:55.709 --> 01:31:55.719 align:start position:0%
judgment and you could say this really
 
01:31:58.310 --> 01:31:58.320 align:start position:0%
about any constitutional um right you
 
01:32:00.229 --> 01:32:00.239 align:start position:0%
know abortion is a constitutional right
 
01:32:02.109 --> 01:32:02.119 align:start position:0%
in the US other kinds of medical
 
01:32:04.310 --> 01:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
procedures aren't um the Supreme Court's
 
01:32:06.750 --> 01:32:06.760 align:start position:0%
decided our our constitution makes that
 
01:32:09.310 --> 01:32:09.320 align:start position:0%
value judge and my obviously I might
 
01:32:10.990 --> 01:32:11.000 align:start position:0%
have some objections to the result but
 
01:32:13.430 --> 01:32:13.440 align:start position:0%
not to the idea of some things being
 
01:32:15.229 --> 01:32:15.239 align:start position:0%
warranting special
 
01:32:17.550 --> 01:32:17.560 align:start position:0%
cons um as far as representative
 
01:32:19.990 --> 01:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
Alexander's question about the idea of
 
01:32:24.250 --> 01:32:24.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:24.260 --> 01:32:25.470 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:32:25.470 --> 01:32:25.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:32:27.830 --> 01:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
yeah sure well I'll just I'll point to
 
01:32:30.070 --> 01:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
the the New Hampshire Supreme Court's
 
01:32:32.590 --> 01:32:32.600 align:start position:0%
case um in the back decision um which
 
01:32:34.709 --> 01:32:34.719 align:start position:0%
you can easily pull up online on on page
 
01:32:37.590 --> 01:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
21 of that decision the court said there
 
01:32:39.510 --> 01:32:39.520 align:start position:0%
the compelling State interest balancing
 
01:32:41.229 --> 01:32:41.239 align:start position:0%
test has proven to be a workable
 
01:32:44.350 --> 01:32:44.360 align:start position:0%
standard in free exercise cases so I
 
01:32:45.870 --> 01:32:45.880 align:start position:0%
just don't think there's any evidence
 
01:32:47.470 --> 01:32:47.480 align:start position:0%
and I think this is true at the national
 
01:32:49.109 --> 01:32:49.119 align:start position:0%
level as well that this is actually
 
01:32:51.830 --> 01:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
going to lead to all kinds of Chaos um
 
01:32:54.430 --> 01:32:54.440 align:start position:0%
or nullifying of ordinary laws the US
 
01:32:56.229 --> 01:32:56.239 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court also addressed this issue
 
01:32:58.189 --> 01:32:58.199 align:start position:0%
in the sherbet decision in the 60s and
 
01:33:00.470 --> 01:33:00.480 align:start position:0%
it said we don't see any evidence this
 
01:33:02.270 --> 01:33:02.280 align:start position:0%
kind of mingering or deceit is going to
 
01:33:04.430 --> 01:33:04.440 align:start position:0%
be a real problem and if there were some
 
01:33:05.830 --> 01:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
evidence it probably wouldn't be
 
01:33:07.430 --> 01:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
sufficient to
 
01:33:09.910 --> 01:33:09.920 align:start position:0%
justify imposing on free exercise of
 
01:33:11.950 --> 01:33:11.960 align:start position:0%
religion so for those reasons I think
 
01:33:13.950 --> 01:33:13.960 align:start position:0%
that it's important to have some special
 
01:33:16.030 --> 01:33:16.040 align:start position:0%
protections for places of worship and in
 
01:33:19.270 --> 01:33:19.280 align:start position:0%
a time of emergency especially but also
 
01:33:21.950 --> 01:33:21.960 align:start position:0%
generally thank thank you Mr are there
 
01:33:25.430 --> 01:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:28.870 --> 01:33:28.880 align:start position:0%

01:33:41.920 --> 01:33:48.629 align:start position:0%
 
there

01:33:48.629 --> 01:33:48.639 align:start position:0%

senior pastor at the New Hampton
 
01:34:02.030 --> 01:34:02.040 align:start position:0%
Community Church in New Hampton New
 
01:34:04.229 --> 01:34:04.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I really do urge you to
 
01:34:07.709 --> 01:34:07.719 align:start position:0%
support this bill because churches have
 
01:34:10.590 --> 01:34:10.600 align:start position:0%
a very significant part in our
 
01:34:12.629 --> 01:34:12.639 align:start position:0%
communities uh even in New Hampshire
 
01:34:15.510 --> 01:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
where it may be a small uh small parts
 
01:34:18.149 --> 01:34:18.159 align:start position:0%
in our small towns it really does
 
01:34:20.910 --> 01:34:20.920 align:start position:0%
provide a large and significant impact
 
01:34:23.990 --> 01:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
in our community unities through this uh
 
01:34:26.470 --> 01:34:26.480 align:start position:0%
pandemic that we've been in we have been
 
01:34:28.070 --> 01:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
actively caring for people in our
 
01:34:31.109 --> 01:34:31.119 align:start position:0%
community uh people in our our area have
 
01:34:33.109 --> 01:34:33.119 align:start position:0%
been doing grocery shopping they've been
 
01:34:35.629 --> 01:34:35.639 align:start position:0%
providing meals they've done assistance
 
01:34:38.990 --> 01:34:39.000 align:start position:0%
for groceries as in financial assistance
 
01:34:41.830 --> 01:34:41.840 align:start position:0%
uh we've been doing Wellness calls
 
01:34:44.390 --> 01:34:44.400 align:start position:0%
helping with heating supplies and other
 
01:34:47.189 --> 01:34:47.199 align:start position:0%
ways uh giving people rides to hospital
 
01:34:48.910 --> 01:34:48.920 align:start position:0%
when that was appropriate or I should
 
01:34:50.390 --> 01:34:50.400 align:start position:0%
say to doctor's appointments when that
 
01:34:52.950 --> 01:34:52.960 align:start position:0%
was appropriate and uh and
 
01:34:55.470 --> 01:34:55.480 align:start position:0%
safe and I really believe that we can be
 
01:34:58.350 --> 01:34:58.360 align:start position:0%
trusted to safeguard the health and of
 
01:35:00.350 --> 01:35:00.360 align:start position:0%
the people in our congregation and the
 
01:35:03.510 --> 01:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
surrounding communities uh churches
 
01:35:06.990 --> 01:35:07.000 align:start position:0%
really are essential for the emotional
 
01:35:09.910 --> 01:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
and spiritual health of our communities
 
01:35:12.310 --> 01:35:12.320 align:start position:0%
and it is very important that we uphold
 
01:35:14.790 --> 01:35:14.800 align:start position:0%
this and allow the government to give
 
01:35:18.149 --> 01:35:18.159 align:start position:0%
guidelines on Gathering but allow
 
01:35:21.109 --> 01:35:21.119 align:start position:0%
churches to make the decision uh and and
 
01:35:25.030 --> 01:35:25.040 align:start position:0%
be wise and focus on the health of our
 
01:35:27.590 --> 01:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
people but it is essential uh for
 
01:35:30.550 --> 01:35:30.560 align:start position:0%
churches to be able to regulate uh and
 
01:35:32.870 --> 01:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
know when we can gather and not be
 
01:35:34.750 --> 01:35:34.760 align:start position:0%
regulated by the government so I
 
01:35:37.870 --> 01:35:37.880 align:start position:0%

01:35:39.830 --> 01:35:39.840 align:start position:0%

great thank you so much as you said my
 
01:36:14.430 --> 01:36:14.440 align:start position:0%
name is John Barnes I'm the pastor of
 
01:36:15.790 --> 01:36:15.800 align:start position:0%
the state line Baptist Church in
 
01:36:18.030 --> 01:36:18.040 align:start position:0%
Portsmith New Hampshire and my wife and
 
01:36:20.270 --> 01:36:20.280 align:start position:0%
I live in pelum we've lived there for
 
01:36:22.510 --> 01:36:22.520 align:start position:0%
seven years and actually almost eight
 
01:36:24.350 --> 01:36:24.360 align:start position:0%
years we started the church State Line
 
01:36:25.870 --> 01:36:25.880 align:start position:0%
Baptist Church is a church plant in
 
01:36:27.430 --> 01:36:27.440 align:start position:0%
Portsmith we tell the whole story
 
01:36:30.109 --> 01:36:30.119 align:start position:0%
especially since I have two minutes but
 
01:36:32.070 --> 01:36:32.080 align:start position:0%
um I want to reference an email that I
 
01:36:35.950 --> 01:36:35.960 align:start position:0%
sent to the um to Governor sununu last
 
01:36:38.910 --> 01:36:38.920 align:start position:0%
May and to the uh reopen committee and
 
01:36:40.950 --> 01:36:40.960 align:start position:0%
such in reference to the church just
 
01:36:42.229 --> 01:36:42.239 align:start position:0%
kind of echoing what this pastor just
 
01:36:45.350 --> 01:36:45.360 align:start position:0%
said a moment ago but um I liken the
 
01:36:47.390 --> 01:36:47.400 align:start position:0%
church you know probably many of us even
 
01:36:50.149 --> 01:36:50.159 align:start position:0%
in this committee have and if you don't
 
01:36:51.950 --> 01:36:51.960 align:start position:0%
that's fine but many of us have some
 
01:36:54.629 --> 01:36:54.639 align:start position:0%
form of a church relationship and and I
 
01:36:56.030 --> 01:36:56.040 align:start position:0%
like to liken the church to many
 
01:36:57.910 --> 01:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
different things from a spiritual
 
01:36:59.990 --> 01:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
perspective a spiritual
 
01:37:03.310 --> 01:37:03.320 align:start position:0%
hospital um but I my I think the best
 
01:37:05.910 --> 01:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
way and the email says this a little bit
 
01:37:08.430 --> 01:37:08.440 align:start position:0%
so I don't want to just be redundant but
 
01:37:10.430 --> 01:37:10.440 align:start position:0%
I really liken the church to a
 
01:37:13.990 --> 01:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
family you know and I can't help but
 
01:37:16.750 --> 01:37:16.760 align:start position:0%
think uh even just uh two days ago on
 
01:37:18.669 --> 01:37:18.679 align:start position:0%
Wednesday I had the privilege to
 
01:37:21.709 --> 01:37:21.719 align:start position:0%
officiate the funeral at um military
 
01:37:23.750 --> 01:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
cemetery there in conquer for a
 
01:37:26.750 --> 01:37:26.760 align:start position:0%
93-year-old World War II veteran uh
 
01:37:30.430 --> 01:37:30.440 align:start position:0%
Lynwood Lesley served our country
 
01:37:33.790 --> 01:37:33.800 align:start position:0%
an amazing man who really um I've only
 
01:37:35.629 --> 01:37:35.639 align:start position:0%
known personally for the last maybe six
 
01:37:37.830 --> 01:37:37.840 align:start position:0%
to eight months but the door opened
 
01:37:40.030 --> 01:37:40.040 align:start position:0%
because about a year and a half ago I
 
01:37:41.310 --> 01:37:41.320 align:start position:0%
had the privilege to start doing
 
01:37:43.189 --> 01:37:43.199 align:start position:0%
services on Tuesday nights church
 
01:37:44.870 --> 01:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
services on Tuesday nights at Maple
 
01:37:47.270 --> 01:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
Suites which is a retirement community
 
01:37:50.030 --> 01:37:50.040 align:start position:0%
in Dover just about 20 minutes from our
 
01:37:53.629 --> 01:37:53.639 align:start position:0%
church and and um I say that partly
 
01:37:56.109 --> 01:37:56.119 align:start position:0%
because of just thinking of the the many
 
01:37:57.990 --> 01:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
facets of the church and the privilege
 
01:38:00.750 --> 01:38:00.760 align:start position:0%
to Ser serve and love the people in our
 
01:38:03.149 --> 01:38:03.159 align:start position:0%
communities as this previous Pastor just
 
01:38:06.750 --> 01:38:06.760 align:start position:0%
said and um and again if it's not
 
01:38:07.990 --> 01:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
obviously I realize it's not the
 
01:38:09.669 --> 01:38:09.679 align:start position:0%
immediate family but it's an extended
 
01:38:11.990 --> 01:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
family and I just the privilege to
 
01:38:15.390 --> 01:38:15.400 align:start position:0%
minister to the lesle family and then um
 
01:38:17.149 --> 01:38:17.159 align:start position:0%
and then the folks at Maple Suites and
 
01:38:19.830 --> 01:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
we respected of course the four to five
 
01:38:22.270 --> 01:38:22.280 align:start position:0%
months that we were uh we needed to wait
 
01:38:24.910 --> 01:38:24.920 align:start position:0%
to be able to be in there and maple
 
01:38:28.189 --> 01:38:28.199 align:start position:0%
Suites but um I Echo the sentiment
 
01:38:30.709 --> 01:38:30.719 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly uh the essentiality of
 
01:38:32.470 --> 01:38:32.480 align:start position:0%
the church and I want to thank you for
 
01:38:34.149 --> 01:38:34.159 align:start position:0%

01:38:36.470 --> 01:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
little bit of my heart and thank you for
 
01:38:38.109 --> 01:38:38.119 align:start position:0%

Mr chair um I'll be brief one of the
 
01:38:52.709 --> 01:38:52.719 align:start position:0%
things has always interested me is
 
01:38:54.709 --> 01:38:54.719 align:start position:0%
because I'm a Catholic and so there were
 
01:38:58.510 --> 01:38:58.520 align:start position:0%
rules around our church closing um I saw
 
01:39:01.109 --> 01:39:01.119 align:start position:0%
the Home Depot stay open and I saw the
 
01:39:04.390 --> 01:39:04.400 align:start position:0%
grocery stores stay open but we did see
 
01:39:06.629 --> 01:39:06.639 align:start position:0%

the pastor here for 29 years and I'm
 
01:40:26.589 --> 01:40:26.599 align:start position:0%
supporting the regular scheduled worship
 
01:40:29.070 --> 01:40:29.080 align:start position:0%
and church services in the event of such
 
01:40:32.390 --> 01:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
an emergency which if 1800 and something
 
01:40:33.709 --> 01:40:33.719 align:start position:0%
was the last time hopefully we got it
 
01:40:35.310 --> 01:40:35.320 align:start position:0%
over with for another 200 years that'd
 
01:40:38.070 --> 01:40:38.080 align:start position:0%
be good um we work with many people off
 
01:40:40.189 --> 01:40:40.199 align:start position:0%
the street and many of them I haven't
 
01:40:43.189 --> 01:40:43.199 align:start position:0%
seen in a year they have spiritual needs
 
01:40:45.629 --> 01:40:45.639 align:start position:0%
they have emotional needs their family
 
01:40:47.950 --> 01:40:47.960 align:start position:0%
situations are impacted we' made some
 
01:40:50.030 --> 01:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
adjustments which have been very helpful
 
01:40:52.790 --> 01:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
we've gone to Facebook live and we did
 
01:40:55.750 --> 01:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
have to have 10 people and then you know
 
01:40:57.510 --> 01:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
little bit bigger amount now half of our
 
01:41:00.870 --> 01:41:00.880 align:start position:0%
occupancy and so we've done social
 
01:41:04.310 --> 01:41:04.320 align:start position:0%
distancing uh separated the pews U taped
 
01:41:07.709 --> 01:41:07.719 align:start position:0%
off marks on the floor people wear masks
 
01:41:09.830 --> 01:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
uh they have more gloves and you know
 
01:41:11.750 --> 01:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
different things I work extensively with
 
01:41:13.669 --> 01:41:13.679 align:start position:0%
the incarcerated those who have gotten
 
01:41:15.189 --> 01:41:15.199 align:start position:0%
out of jail those who've gotten out of
 
01:41:17.830 --> 01:41:17.840 align:start position:0%
prison and we are probably averaging 20
 
01:41:21.470 --> 01:41:21.480 align:start position:0%
to 30 a week here at church uh from from
 
01:41:24.149 --> 01:41:24.159 align:start position:0%
that type of background and I was
 
01:41:25.669 --> 01:41:25.679 align:start position:0%
listening to I think a news article this
 
01:41:26.830 --> 01:41:26.840 align:start position:0%
morning on the radio they were talking
 
01:41:29.270 --> 01:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
about the reism r and that's something
 
01:41:31.589 --> 01:41:31.599 align:start position:0%
that we always want to eliminate people
 
01:41:33.950 --> 01:41:33.960 align:start position:0%
going back I think church is really
 
01:41:35.629 --> 01:41:35.639 align:start position:0%
important with that because it connects
 
01:41:37.790 --> 01:41:37.800 align:start position:0%
people with the community with a pastor
 
01:41:40.270 --> 01:41:40.280 align:start position:0%
with faith and we've seen so much growth
 
01:41:42.750 --> 01:41:42.760 align:start position:0%
in this area and we've seen that just
 
01:41:46.950 --> 01:41:46.960 align:start position:0%
drop off in a major way but people turn
 
01:41:49.270 --> 01:41:49.280 align:start position:0%
to church they turn turn to religion the
 
01:41:50.950 --> 01:41:50.960 align:start position:0%
Bible assembling with each other for
 
01:41:52.830 --> 01:41:52.840 align:start position:0%
support and encouragement we should be
 
01:41:54.750 --> 01:41:54.760 align:start position:0%
allowed to do this safely at least as
 
01:41:56.430 --> 01:41:56.440 align:start position:0%
safe as going to a lumber yard or
 
01:42:00.629 --> 01:42:00.639 align:start position:0%
grocery store car you could just wind up
 
01:42:05.550 --> 01:42:05.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:09.910 --> 01:42:09.920 align:start position:0%

01:42:19.760 --> 01:42:21.830 align:start position:0%
 
carahan

01:42:21.830 --> 01:42:21.840 align:start position:0%
carahan
 
01:42:25.870 --> 01:42:25.880 align:start position:0%
yes can you hear me you can uh well I
 
01:42:28.149 --> 01:42:28.159 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman committee members
 
01:42:29.910 --> 01:42:29.920 align:start position:0%
uh I'm Reverend Edward Carnahan pastor
 
01:42:31.510 --> 01:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
of Portsmith Believers Church and I
 
01:42:32.870 --> 01:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
support HB
 
01:42:35.550 --> 01:42:35.560 align:start position:0%
542 I believe churches are essential at
 
01:42:37.669 --> 01:42:37.679 align:start position:0%
any time but especially during a time of
 
01:42:39.790 --> 01:42:39.800 align:start position:0%
Crisis uh one of the things that I want
 
01:42:41.790 --> 01:42:41.800 align:start position:0%
to make in the few minutes that I have
 
01:42:45.109 --> 01:42:45.119 align:start position:0%
here is uh why churches are essential
 
01:42:47.149 --> 01:42:47.159 align:start position:0%
this is never a question that's asked
 
01:42:49.229 --> 01:42:49.239 align:start position:0%
with Walmart or Home Depot because it's
 
01:42:51.510 --> 01:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
obvious why they're essential but for
 
01:42:54.470 --> 01:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
churches during a time of Crisis three
 
01:42:56.270 --> 01:42:56.280 align:start position:0%
three things always happen in society
 
01:42:59.270 --> 01:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
during a time of Crisis um fear panic
 
01:43:01.709 --> 01:43:01.719 align:start position:0%
and distrust of the government when left
 
01:43:03.709 --> 01:43:03.719 align:start position:0%
unchecked all three can increase the
 
01:43:05.870 --> 01:43:05.880 align:start position:0%
severity of the crisis and hinder the
 
01:43:08.229 --> 01:43:08.239 align:start position:0%
government's role in solving the problem
 
01:43:10.629 --> 01:43:10.639 align:start position:0%
meeting people face to face brings a
 
01:43:13.310 --> 01:43:13.320 align:start position:0%
sense of Peace normality and inclusion
 
01:43:14.790 --> 01:43:14.800 align:start position:0%
which will calm an individual and
 
01:43:17.470 --> 01:43:17.480 align:start position:0%
relieve stress I'll conclude by saying
 
01:43:19.870 --> 01:43:19.880 align:start position:0%
in 1933 during his inaugural address
 
01:43:21.830 --> 01:43:21.840 align:start position:0%
Franklin rosev who at the time was
 
01:43:23.750 --> 01:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
facing one of the greatest threats to
 
01:43:25.669 --> 01:43:25.679 align:start position:0%
this country in the world said we have
 
01:43:27.990 --> 01:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
nothing to fear but fear itself he
 
01:43:30.109 --> 01:43:30.119 align:start position:0%
recognized that fear in people stops the
 
01:43:31.950 --> 01:43:31.960 align:start position:0%
progress necessary to overcome the
 
01:43:34.550 --> 01:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
crisis the church is by far the most
 
01:43:36.950 --> 01:43:36.960 align:start position:0%
qualified organization in existence to
 
01:43:38.830 --> 01:43:38.840 align:start position:0%
deal with this effectively and this is
 
01:43:41.430 --> 01:43:41.440 align:start position:0%
why I deem church is essential thank
 
01:43:44.030 --> 01:43:44.040 align:start position:0%

Justin Coram I Just Want to Thank You Mr
 
01:44:12.669 --> 01:44:12.679 align:start position:0%
chair and members of the committee uh I
 
01:44:16.709 --> 01:44:16.719 align:start position:0%
am in support of House Bill 542 and I'm
 
01:44:19.470 --> 01:44:19.480 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to uh you know most of the
 
01:44:21.229 --> 01:44:21.239 align:start position:0%
same reasons have already been mentioned
 
01:44:24.950 --> 01:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
you know i' I've seen the increase um in
 
01:44:26.950 --> 01:44:26.960 align:start position:0%
anxiety depression
 
01:44:29.109 --> 01:44:29.119 align:start position:0%
hopelessness uh particularly in the
 
01:44:32.589 --> 01:44:32.599 align:start position:0%
young people that I am working with um
 
01:44:34.669 --> 01:44:34.679 align:start position:0%
in in my community and and when things
 
01:44:37.910 --> 01:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
shut down um how important connection is
 
01:44:40.550 --> 01:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
for them and and they were separated
 
01:44:43.270 --> 01:44:43.280 align:start position:0%
from not only friends but separated from
 
01:44:45.070 --> 01:44:45.080 align:start position:0%
worshiping God together as a community
 
01:44:47.430 --> 01:44:47.440 align:start position:0%
and and really didn't have a spiritual a
 
01:44:49.310 --> 01:44:49.320 align:start position:0%
place to be spiritually encouraged or
 
01:44:51.470 --> 01:44:51.480 align:start position:0%
emotionally supported and and I think
 
01:44:53.709 --> 01:44:53.719 align:start position:0%
there's been so much emotional trauma
 
01:44:55.790 --> 01:44:55.800 align:start position:0%
throughout um this year and I'm sure
 
01:44:58.149 --> 01:44:58.159 align:start position:0%
each of us have experienced it in one
 
01:45:01.910 --> 01:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
way or another throughout um 2020 and
 
01:45:04.750 --> 01:45:04.760 align:start position:0%
even to today and so I think for a lot
 
01:45:06.270 --> 01:45:06.280 align:start position:0%
of our church members it's just so
 
01:45:08.109 --> 01:45:08.119 align:start position:0%
important to be able to gather together
 
01:45:10.990 --> 01:45:11.000 align:start position:0%
and to be encouraged and really
 
01:45:13.390 --> 01:45:13.400 align:start position:0%
empowered to face the next day with
 
01:45:15.030 --> 01:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
purpose and I mean for us Church
 
01:45:17.709 --> 01:45:17.719 align:start position:0%
community faith is what fills us with
 
01:45:22.550 --> 01:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
purpose it gives us a a a re to live um
 
01:45:24.229 --> 01:45:24.239 align:start position:0%
and so you know it reminds people that
 
01:45:25.790 --> 01:45:25.800 align:start position:0%
they're loved by God they're loved by
 
01:45:28.629 --> 01:45:28.639 align:start position:0%
the people in their community and uh
 
01:45:30.270 --> 01:45:30.280 align:start position:0%
they're here for a reason and that they
 
01:45:31.550 --> 01:45:31.560 align:start position:0%
have a purpose and obviously like
 
01:45:33.589 --> 01:45:33.599 align:start position:0%
mentioned before grocery stores gas
 
01:45:35.109 --> 01:45:35.119 align:start position:0%
stations clothing stores nobody's
 
01:45:36.990 --> 01:45:37.000 align:start position:0%
arguing that all of these places
 
01:45:38.390 --> 01:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
hospitals they're they're very much
 
01:45:41.790 --> 01:45:41.800 align:start position:0%
Essential but just to express how we
 
01:45:44.910 --> 01:45:44.920 align:start position:0%
feel um the spiritual and mental
 
01:45:47.950 --> 01:45:47.960 align:start position:0%
well-being that churches provide people
 
01:45:50.950 --> 01:45:50.960 align:start position:0%
is just as essential uh if not more in
 
01:45:52.550 --> 01:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
in my opinion as as these other
 
01:45:55.030 --> 01:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
essential Services um so I just want to

that my brothers have said uh colleagues

um and you have that before you uh but
 
01:47:28.629 --> 01:47:28.639 align:start position:0%
uh I will just quote um uh the preacher
 
01:47:31.430 --> 01:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
uh the son of David um in Ecclesiastes 4
 
01:47:34.510 --> 01:47:34.520 align:start position:0%
when he says two are better than one or
 
01:47:36.510 --> 01:47:36.520 align:start position:0%
if they fall one will lift up his fellow
 
01:47:38.149 --> 01:47:38.159 align:start position:0%
but woe to him who is alone when he
 
01:47:41.750 --> 01:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
falls and has not another to lift him up
 
01:47:44.589 --> 01:47:44.599 align:start position:0%
a court of three strands is not quickly
 
01:47:47.950 --> 01:47:47.960 align:start position:0%
broken and uh that speaks to what
 
01:47:49.629 --> 01:47:49.639 align:start position:0%
everyone else has said and so I will
 
01:47:52.550 --> 01:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
defer uh to them uh as I can add nothing
 
01:47:53.830 --> 01:47:53.840 align:start position:0%

of the church at the intersection in
 
01:48:40.990 --> 01:48:41.000 align:start position:0%
marac I've also sent you an email with
 
01:48:42.550 --> 01:48:42.560 align:start position:0%
these statements so uh rather than
 
01:48:44.109 --> 01:48:44.119 align:start position:0%
reiterate what everybody's already said
 
01:48:47.550 --> 01:48:47.560 align:start position:0%
I agree to uh to these other pastors
 
01:48:49.669 --> 01:48:49.679 align:start position:0%
other comments have been made um the
 
01:48:52.910 --> 01:48:52.920 align:start position:0%
Constitution it of this um also but the
 
01:48:55.310 --> 01:48:55.320 align:start position:0%
the the history of New England and the
 
01:48:57.870 --> 01:48:57.880 align:start position:0%
church in New England has been powerful
 
01:48:59.589 --> 01:48:59.599 align:start position:0%
the biggest colleges up here the most
 
01:49:01.629 --> 01:49:01.639 align:start position:0%
esteemed universities they were started
 
01:49:03.709 --> 01:49:03.719 align:start position:0%
by people who were religious and the
 
01:49:06.550 --> 01:49:06.560 align:start position:0%
church was core to that uh and Church of
 
01:49:08.589 --> 01:49:08.599 align:start position:0%
course can be without Sunday morning or
 
01:49:10.149 --> 01:49:10.159 align:start position:0%
it can it be that's that's the big
 
01:49:11.950 --> 01:49:11.960 align:start position:0%
question and it really can't be I've
 
01:49:13.229 --> 01:49:13.239 align:start position:0%
heard a couple of the other pastors
 
01:49:15.830 --> 01:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
mention that young children young people
 
01:49:17.550 --> 01:49:17.560 align:start position:0%
and seniors were affected by this and
 
01:49:19.669 --> 01:49:19.679 align:start position:0%
indeed that was the case in our church
 
01:49:21.350 --> 01:49:21.360 align:start position:0%
and we've noticed in the last few weeks
 
01:49:23.149 --> 01:49:23.159 align:start position:0%
being able to breathe a little more
 
01:49:24.990 --> 01:49:25.000 align:start position:0%
obviously over last year trying to be
 
01:49:27.030 --> 01:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
safe trying to be prudent trying to be
 
01:49:29.709 --> 01:49:29.719 align:start position:0%
uh within State protocol we did all that
 
01:49:30.990 --> 01:49:31.000 align:start position:0%
but we've been able to open up a little
 
01:49:33.229 --> 01:49:33.239 align:start position:0%
more here lately and and people are
 
01:49:34.990 --> 01:49:35.000 align:start position:0%
hungry for the fellowship and the
 
01:49:37.550 --> 01:49:37.560 align:start position:0%
communication the interaction uh so
 
01:49:39.189 --> 01:49:39.199 align:start position:0%
again I can I can go with the other
 
01:49:41.229 --> 01:49:41.239 align:start position:0%
pastors and tell you that people need
 
01:49:43.870 --> 01:49:43.880 align:start position:0%
this uh it does contribute to the
 
01:49:46.149 --> 01:49:46.159 align:start position:0%
community and um I would say this to an
 
01:49:48.229 --> 01:49:48.239 align:start position:0%
ending Home Depot and Walmart went
 
01:49:50.070 --> 01:49:50.080 align:start position:0%
around 200 years ago when the
 
01:49:51.629 --> 01:49:51.639 align:start position:0%
universities were being started in towns
 
01:49:54.229 --> 01:49:54.239 align:start position:0%
are being established the church was and
 
01:49:56.109 --> 01:49:56.119 align:start position:0%
it assisted in that and continues today
 
01:49:57.550 --> 01:49:57.560 align:start position:0%
so I think it's a very important part of
 
01:49:59.830 --> 01:49:59.840 align:start position:0%
the culture of linin and I would just
 
01:50:01.189 --> 01:50:01.199 align:start position:0%
say that and encourage you again to
 
01:50:05.270 --> 01:50:05.280 align:start position:0%

to show support for HP 542 the framers
 
01:51:04.910 --> 01:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
of our constitution understood that
 
01:51:07.030 --> 01:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
people of Faith are bound by conscience
 
01:51:08.550 --> 01:51:08.560 align:start position:0%
to fulfill the mandates of their
 
01:51:10.430 --> 01:51:10.440 align:start position:0%
religion and while there is a great
 
01:51:12.270 --> 01:51:12.280 align:start position:0%
diversity of religious conviction in New
 
01:51:14.390 --> 01:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire these convictions reside at
 
01:51:17.189 --> 01:51:17.199 align:start position:0%
the very core of who we are as people in
 
01:51:18.629 --> 01:51:18.639 align:start position:0%
other words the corporate religious
 
01:51:21.189 --> 01:51:21.199 align:start position:0%
gathering is essential no different in
 
01:51:23.350 --> 01:51:23.360 align:start position:0%
importance than purchasing food
 
01:51:25.109 --> 01:51:25.119 align:start position:0%
receiving medical care or engaging in
 
01:51:27.550 --> 01:51:27.560 align:start position:0%
gainful employment if the covid-19
 
01:51:29.229 --> 01:51:29.239 align:start position:0%
crisis has taught us anything it's that
 
01:51:31.470 --> 01:51:31.480 align:start position:0%
the mental emotional and spiritual needs
 
01:51:33.750 --> 01:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
of a person are just as essential as
 
01:51:35.990 --> 01:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
their physical needs furthermore our
 
01:51:37.750 --> 01:51:37.760 align:start position:0%
church and other Christian churches like
 
01:51:40.350 --> 01:51:40.360 align:start position:0%
us are commanded to assemble ourselves
 
01:51:42.470 --> 01:51:42.480 align:start position:0%
together corporately something we cannot
 
01:51:45.229 --> 01:51:45.239 align:start position:0%
Faithfully observe online we are called
 
01:51:46.950 --> 01:51:46.960 align:start position:0%
to gather together not leaving anybody
 
01:51:49.069 --> 01:51:49.079 align:start position:0%
out or limiting their access through
 
01:51:51.189 --> 01:51:51.199 align:start position:0%
capacity restriction s and while
 
01:51:53.430 --> 01:51:53.440 align:start position:0%
together we are called by God to cor
 
01:51:55.750 --> 01:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
corporate prayer singing observing
 
01:51:58.189 --> 01:51:58.199 align:start position:0%
sacramental ordinances and fellowship
 
01:51:59.830 --> 01:51:59.840 align:start position:0%
without these elements present and
 
01:52:01.589 --> 01:52:01.599 align:start position:0%
active we're disobeying the dictates of
 
01:52:03.589 --> 01:52:03.599 align:start position:0%
our conscience as we would be defying
 
01:52:05.950 --> 01:52:05.960 align:start position:0%
God we regularly engage in practices
 
01:52:07.709 --> 01:52:07.719 align:start position:0%
designed to protect our church from all
 
01:52:09.629 --> 01:52:09.639 align:start position:0%
forms of harm we do this not because the
 
01:52:11.709 --> 01:52:11.719 align:start position:0%
government directs us to but because we
 
01:52:13.550 --> 01:52:13.560 align:start position:0%
exercise discernment and compassion
 
01:52:16.910 --> 01:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
toward one another by upholding HP 542
 
01:52:18.629 --> 01:52:18.639 align:start position:0%
and our religious freedom together for
 
01:52:21.109 --> 01:52:21.119 align:start position:0%
peaceful worship we are both honoring
 
01:52:22.990 --> 01:52:23.000 align:start position:0%
and obeying God which is essential for
 
01:52:25.589 --> 01:52:25.599 align:start position:0%
us as well as honoring our obligations
 
01:52:27.669 --> 01:52:27.679 align:start position:0%

Indulgence Mr chair so uh thank you and
 
01:52:39.069 --> 01:52:39.079 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question so we've
 
01:52:40.950 --> 01:52:40.960 align:start position:0%
heard a lot of folks in government go
 
01:52:44.229 --> 01:52:44.239 align:start position:0%
out of their way to recognize healthcare
 
01:52:47.189 --> 01:52:47.199 align:start position:0%
workers recognize grocery store workers
 
01:52:51.069 --> 01:52:51.079 align:start position:0%
recognize all these U essential uh areas
 
01:52:52.510 --> 01:52:52.520 align:start position:0%
and work with them to make sure that
 
01:52:55.510 --> 01:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
they're able to stay open and in your
 
01:52:57.350 --> 01:52:57.360 align:start position:0%
experience in your dealing with the
 
01:52:59.390 --> 01:52:59.400 align:start position:0%
folks in government has it been your
 
01:53:01.109 --> 01:53:01.119 align:start position:0%
experience that you've been treated in
 
01:53:03.189 --> 01:53:03.199 align:start position:0%
the same way with that same level of
 
01:53:06.390 --> 01:53:06.400 align:start position:0%
recognition and that same level of work
 
01:53:08.669 --> 01:53:08.679 align:start position:0%
to get you opened up in the way that
 
01:53:11.430 --> 01:53:11.440 align:start position:0%
these other sectors were opened
 
01:53:13.390 --> 01:53:13.400 align:start position:0%
up thank you for the question I
 
01:53:15.390 --> 01:53:15.400 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity to respond uh
 
01:53:16.990 --> 01:53:17.000 align:start position:0%
I was on a conference call with several
 
01:53:19.270 --> 01:53:19.280 align:start position:0%
other pastors with Senator Bob GAA he
 
01:53:20.990 --> 01:53:21.000 align:start position:0%
was wonderful to work with he was an
 
01:53:23.870 --> 01:53:23.880 align:start position:0%
advocate for us uh but we were uh the
 
01:53:25.589 --> 01:53:25.599 align:start position:0%
general experience that we had was that
 
01:53:28.350 --> 01:53:28.360 align:start position:0%
it was very very slow and uh and very
 
01:53:30.750 --> 01:53:30.760 align:start position:0%
very sluggish uh to get us open we were
 
01:53:32.189 --> 01:53:32.199 align:start position:0%
under the impression we would be shut
 
01:53:34.229 --> 01:53:34.239 align:start position:0%
down for maybe two to four weeks just
 
01:53:36.830 --> 01:53:36.840 align:start position:0%
like the pandemic in 1918 we ended up
 
01:53:38.750 --> 01:53:38.760 align:start position:0%
our church stayed closed for 11 weeks
 
01:53:40.310 --> 01:53:40.320 align:start position:0%
and we pushed hard but we want to
 
01:53:42.550 --> 01:53:42.560 align:start position:0%
observe our subordinates to the
 
01:53:44.270 --> 01:53:44.280 align:start position:0%
government and so we worked hard to be
 
01:53:46.390 --> 01:53:46.400 align:start position:0%
patient but uh we did not feel like we
 
01:53:48.629 --> 01:53:48.639 align:start position:0%
were receiving the same level of of
 
01:53:51.270 --> 01:53:51.280 align:start position:0%
importance or uh even watching the
 
01:53:54.270 --> 01:53:54.280 align:start position:0%
briefings online little to no mention of
 
01:53:56.430 --> 01:53:56.440 align:start position:0%
relig religious organizations and so we
 
01:53:59.189 --> 01:53:59.199 align:start position:0%
did not in my a personal opinion uh
 
01:54:03.470 --> 01:54:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:06.390 --> 01:54:06.400 align:start position:0%

Hampshire I've been Pastor there for 21

community for all these years during
 
01:54:37.870 --> 01:54:37.880 align:start position:0%
many of the crisis we've had with
 
01:54:40.950 --> 01:54:40.960 align:start position:0%
snowstorms even the ice storm in
 
01:54:43.270 --> 01:54:43.280 align:start position:0%
2008 we have been able to provide
 
01:54:46.149 --> 01:54:46.159 align:start position:0%
effectively for the spiritual physical
 
01:54:48.350 --> 01:54:48.360 align:start position:0%
emotional and mental needs of the
 
01:54:50.550 --> 01:54:50.560 align:start position:0%
people and it
 
01:54:54.149 --> 01:54:54.159 align:start position:0%
has made for a better nit Community
 
01:54:56.229 --> 01:54:56.239 align:start position:0%
we've hosted many blog parties where we
 
01:54:58.030 --> 01:54:58.040 align:start position:0%
give everything for free and I believe
 
01:55:00.390 --> 01:55:00.400 align:start position:0%
the church like I tell our people it's
 
01:55:03.430 --> 01:55:03.440 align:start position:0%
like a a Lifeboat in the middle of
 
01:55:06.510 --> 01:55:06.520 align:start position:0%
Titanic emergencies we want to be there
 
01:55:07.950 --> 01:55:07.960 align:start position:0%
when there's needs when people are
 
01:55:11.470 --> 01:55:11.480 align:start position:0%
drowning in hopelessness in fear in
 
01:55:14.109 --> 01:55:14.119 align:start position:0%
distress they need someone to stand with
 
01:55:17.470 --> 01:55:17.480 align:start position:0%
them the church is ready to do that
 
01:55:20.390 --> 01:55:20.400 align:start position:0%
history attests to that in the second
 
01:55:22.910 --> 01:55:22.920 align:start position:0%
and third Century in the plagues of
 
01:55:26.470 --> 01:55:26.480 align:start position:0%
antonine in Cyprus many of the
 
01:55:28.109 --> 01:55:28.119 align:start position:0%
Christians went out there to help their
 
01:55:30.390 --> 01:55:30.400 align:start position:0%
communities and I think we will be a
 
01:55:32.990 --> 01:55:33.000 align:start position:0%
better and stronger state for that and I

needs of the EM of the recovery

Community sore our faith community was
 
01:58:30.510 --> 01:58:30.520 align:start position:0%
intentional about becoming a Good
 
01:58:32.589 --> 01:58:32.599 align:start position:0%
Samaritan which is the essential call of
 
01:58:34.990 --> 01:58:35.000 align:start position:0%
the church it called it's called the
 
01:58:37.149 --> 01:58:37.159 align:start position:0%
Great Commission meeting the needs of
 
01:58:40.390 --> 01:58:40.400 align:start position:0%
the underserved is certainly good news
 
01:58:42.390 --> 01:58:42.400 align:start position:0%
years ago we formed a multi-church
 
01:58:45.030 --> 01:58:45.040 align:start position:0%
Outreach team which organizes our
 
01:58:47.390 --> 01:58:47.400 align:start position:0%
network of churches to respond when
 
01:58:50.229 --> 01:58:50.239 align:start position:0%
needs suddenly arise like an emergency
 
01:58:52.830 --> 01:58:52.840 align:start position:0%
like a pandemic we plan to be ready to
 
01:58:54.750 --> 01:58:54.760 align:start position:0%
serve because we were intentional about
 
01:58:56.550 --> 01:58:56.560 align:start position:0%
building partners and networks with
 
01:58:59.470 --> 01:58:59.480 align:start position:0%
proven success so my question is simply
 
01:59:01.910 --> 01:59:01.920 align:start position:0%

01:59:07.430 --> 01:59:07.440 align:start position:0%
your I guess I could finish just asking
 
01:59:08.950 --> 01:59:08.960 align:start position:0%
the question is why would you want to
 
01:59:11.510 --> 01:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
undercut the the health of our
 
01:59:13.750 --> 01:59:13.760 align:start position:0%
communities by eliminating the faith
 
01:59:16.589 --> 01:59:16.599 align:start position:0%

serious about both my faith and my
 
02:00:26.950 --> 02:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
Constitution uh when any of the branches

duties overstep their authori
 
02:00:32.550 --> 02:00:32.560 align:start position:0%
responsibility the other branches to

authority to prevent repetition of these

abuses I want to be clear I believe
 
02:00:43.310 --> 02:00:43.320 align:start position:0%
Governor cunu has done an extraordinary
 
02:00:46.189 --> 02:00:46.199 align:start position:0%
job in extraordinary circumstances we
 
02:00:47.910 --> 02:00:47.920 align:start position:0%
look at other leaders across our nation
 
02:00:49.950 --> 02:00:49.960 align:start position:0%
and the world we can see a wide range of
 
02:00:52.550 --> 02:00:52.560 align:start position:0%
actions from Reckless indifference
 
02:00:55.390 --> 02:00:55.400 align:start position:0%
fearful idity and outright
 
02:00:57.550 --> 02:00:57.560 align:start position:0%
authoritarianism uh within or among
 
02:00:59.189 --> 02:00:59.199 align:start position:0%
those leaders Governor Cudo was on the
 
02:01:01.229 --> 02:01:01.239 align:start position:0%
top constantly balancing State interests
 
02:01:03.149 --> 02:01:03.159 align:start position:0%
and constitutional rights risks and
 
02:01:05.870 --> 02:01:05.880 align:start position:0%
benefits information and the unknown uh
 
02:01:07.109 --> 02:01:07.119 align:start position:0%
I was privileged to be a member of his
 
02:01:08.669 --> 02:01:08.679 align:start position:0%
task force and leader a smaller working
 
02:01:10.669 --> 02:01:10.679 align:start position:0%
group that helped formulate guidance for
 
02:01:13.709 --> 02:01:13.719 align:start position:0%
reopening houses of worship last year I
 
02:01:15.550 --> 02:01:15.560 align:start position:0%
found him in his office in most cases to
 
02:01:17.589 --> 02:01:17.599 align:start position:0%
be very reasonable and eager to move
 
02:01:19.350 --> 02:01:19.360 align:start position:0%
that process forward and I thank him for
 
02:01:21.790 --> 02:01:21.800 align:start position:0%
that yet mistakes were made overreach
 
02:01:23.990 --> 02:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
has occurred and at two particular time
 
02:01:26.750 --> 02:01:26.760 align:start position:0%
times I joined with other pastors uh to
 
02:01:29.669 --> 02:01:29.679 align:start position:0%
call out those abuses and eventually end
 
02:01:33.030 --> 02:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
up in a precipitous uh conflict uh
 
02:01:34.669 --> 02:01:34.679 align:start position:0%
details of that I will send on with my
 
02:01:37.669 --> 02:01:37.679 align:start position:0%
extended remarks uh though I disagreed
 
02:01:39.229 --> 02:01:39.239 align:start position:0%
with the governor in these cases I did
 
02:01:40.990 --> 02:01:41.000 align:start position:0%
not call into question his Integrity
 
02:01:44.310 --> 02:01:44.320 align:start position:0%
character efforts or overall performance
 
02:01:46.149 --> 02:01:46.159 align:start position:0%
however I do believe that it's time for
 
02:01:49.069 --> 02:01:49.079 align:start position:0%
the governor and his legislature to take
 
02:01:51.750 --> 02:01:51.760 align:start position:0%
Tes take action to over to prevent
 
02:01:54.350 --> 02:01:54.360 align:start position:0%
future oversteps of authority uh when
 
02:01:55.709 --> 02:01:55.719 align:start position:0%
passed by the court and Senate and
 
02:01:57.510 --> 02:01:57.520 align:start position:0%
signed by the governor this will begin
 
02:01:59.109 --> 02:01:59.119 align:start position:0%
the corrective action it will help
 
02:02:00.830 --> 02:02:00.840 align:start position:0%
secure vital freedom to worship as
 
02:02:02.109 --> 02:02:02.119 align:start position:0%
guaranteed by the First Amendment of the
 
02:02:04.510 --> 02:02:04.520 align:start position:0%
United States Constitution in part one
 
02:02:06.950 --> 02:02:06.960 align:start position:0%

02:02:09.669 --> 02:02:09.679 align:start position:0%
Constitution regardless of the distaste
 
02:02:11.550 --> 02:02:11.560 align:start position:0%
for that of Representative Oregan

so as well but there are a lot of people
 
02:07:06.109 --> 02:07:06.119 align:start position:0%
that we serve not just in a spiritual
 
02:07:08.470 --> 02:07:08.480 align:start position:0%
capacity but as other pastors have said
 
02:07:12.270 --> 02:07:12.280 align:start position:0%
in a needs-based capacity and and if we
 
02:07:15.510 --> 02:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
were to uh just simply keep the doors
 
02:07:17.549 --> 02:07:17.559 align:start position:0%
closed we would figure out a way to make
 
02:07:20.189 --> 02:07:20.199 align:start position:0%
it work um a friend of mine commented
 
02:07:21.950 --> 02:07:21.960 align:start position:0%

telea evangelists uh halfway jokingly
 
02:07:27.229 --> 02:07:27.239 align:start position:0%

02:08:51.310 --> 02:08:51.320 align:start position:0%
able to just tell you of my support of
 
02:08:54.189 --> 02:08:54.199 align:start position:0%
HP um HB
 
02:08:56.750 --> 02:08:56.760 align:start position:0%
542 we had closed our church for two and
 
02:08:59.709 --> 02:08:59.719 align:start position:0%
a half months last spring and witnessed
 
02:09:01.990 --> 02:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
much distress among our congregation and
 
02:09:04.470 --> 02:09:04.480 align:start position:0%
even our community it was sad to see
 
02:09:06.549 --> 02:09:06.559 align:start position:0%
depression anxiety and a general sense
 
02:09:09.310 --> 02:09:09.320 align:start position:0%
of fear overtake many in our
 
02:09:11.510 --> 02:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
congregation I believe the church is
 
02:09:14.470 --> 02:09:14.480 align:start position:0%
essential is an essential entity that
 
02:09:16.709 --> 02:09:16.719 align:start position:0%
many in our society look to for Comfort
 
02:09:18.669 --> 02:09:18.679 align:start position:0%
Direction and compassion during
 
02:09:21.189 --> 02:09:21.199 align:start position:0%
stressful times I.E one thing was why we
 
02:09:23.669 --> 02:09:23.679 align:start position:0%
were shut down is the number of funerals
 
02:09:26.510 --> 02:09:26.520 align:start position:0%
I had to turn away and I had to to talk
 
02:09:29.270 --> 02:09:29.280 align:start position:0%
with those families and and uh uh try to
 
02:09:32.109 --> 02:09:32.119 align:start position:0%
explain to them why as a church we can't
 
02:09:34.390 --> 02:09:34.400 align:start position:0%
meet this need of their family because
 
02:09:36.870 --> 02:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
the state has closed us down uh that was
 
02:09:38.990 --> 02:09:39.000 align:start position:0%
a really sad and very very difficult
 
02:09:40.589 --> 02:09:40.599 align:start position:0%
time for myself and I'm sure other
 
02:09:43.950 --> 02:09:43.960 align:start position:0%
pastors had the same uh sameeh stressful
 
02:09:46.310 --> 02:09:46.320 align:start position:0%
difficulties when church was closed down
 
02:09:48.149 --> 02:09:48.159 align:start position:0%
those people lost a sense of support
 
02:09:50.310 --> 02:09:50.320 align:start position:0%
that that they look towards you know
 
02:09:53.229 --> 02:09:53.239 align:start position:0%
when it comes to funerals and and uh um
 
02:09:55.629 --> 02:09:55.639 align:start position:0%
uh our bread uh food Ministry we had to
 
02:09:57.709 --> 02:09:57.719 align:start position:0%
shut down these are things that are
 
02:10:00.310 --> 02:10:00.320 align:start position:0%
essential uh not just spiritually but
 
02:10:04.270 --> 02:10:04.280 align:start position:0%
practical uh essential needs for uh
 
02:10:06.950 --> 02:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
families in our community uh we had to
 
02:10:08.750 --> 02:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
close down yet big box stores were
 
02:10:10.790 --> 02:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
allowed to stay open other stores were
 
02:10:12.470 --> 02:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
allowed to stay open liquor stores were
 
02:10:14.589 --> 02:10:14.599 align:start position:0%
allowed to stay open but we had to close
 
02:10:18.589 --> 02:10:18.599 align:start position:0%
down we're well we are well aware of how
 
02:10:20.189 --> 02:10:20.199 align:start position:0%
to care for our community and
 
02:10:22.470 --> 02:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
congregation and we can be trusted to
 
02:10:24.990 --> 02:10:25.000 align:start position:0%
install the necessary guidelines to keep
 
02:10:27.310 --> 02:10:27.320 align:start position:0%
our community and congregation safe
 
02:10:30.109 --> 02:10:30.119 align:start position:0%
during these times we are well able to
 
02:10:32.350 --> 02:10:32.360 align:start position:0%
govern ourselves the scripture is clear
 
02:10:33.589 --> 02:10:33.599 align:start position:0%
that we are not to forsake the
 
02:10:35.910 --> 02:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
assembling of ourselves together and we
 
02:10:38.270 --> 02:10:38.280 align:start position:0%
have the privilege and responsibility to
 
02:10:40.669 --> 02:10:40.679 align:start position:0%
govern ourselves and never be fully
 
02:10:43.510 --> 02:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
closed down uh I thank you for giving me
 
02:10:46.069 --> 02:10:46.079 align:start position:0%

giving you my my thoughts um
 
02:10:50.950 --> 02:10:50.960 align:start position:0%
the church is essential in our
 
02:10:54.589 --> 02:10:54.599 align:start position:0%
communities and that has been very clear
 
02:10:56.910 --> 02:10:56.920 align:start position:0%
uh during this time that time that
 
02:10:58.270 --> 02:10:58.280 align:start position:0%
period of time that we had to be shut
 
02:11:01.390 --> 02:11:01.400 align:start position:0%
down okay thank you for your testimony
 
02:11:04.030 --> 02:11:04.040 align:start position:0%

War seeing none again thank you that

02:11:14.629 --> 02:11:14.639 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who feels compelled
 
02:11:14.639 --> 02:11:17.149 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who feels compelled
to

02:11:17.149 --> 02:11:17.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:17.159 --> 02:11:19.790 align:start position:0%

seeing no one we will close the hearing
 
02:11:25.669 --> 02:11:25.679 align:start position:0%
on House Bill

Wednesday next hearing is on uh we are
 
02:11:36.870 --> 02:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
way behind this morning and know
 
02:11:39.549 --> 02:11:39.559 align:start position:0%
so I'm not going to take a break if
 
02:11:42.270 --> 02:11:42.280 align:start position:0%
people need to if members of the
 
02:11:44.229 --> 02:11:44.239 align:start position:0%
committee need to take a break and leave
 
02:11:46.109 --> 02:11:46.119 align:start position:0%
for short periods of time that's fine it
 
02:11:47.510 --> 02:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
certainly to be understood but I don't
 
02:11:49.189 --> 02:11:49.199 align:start position:0%
think I can take take a break at this
 
02:11:52.229 --> 02:11:52.239 align:start position:0%

379
 
02:12:00.990 --> 02:12:01.000 align:start position:0%
and there are only two people who are
 
02:12:03.390 --> 02:12:03.400 align:start position:0%

hello uh chairman can you hear me you
 
02:13:32.189 --> 02:13:32.199 align:start position:0%
can my name is n Grace I am with the New
 
02:13:33.709 --> 02:13:33.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal
 
02:13:37.830 --> 02:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
Association we are in support of HB 379
 
02:13:41.069 --> 02:13:41.079 align:start position:0%
it's actually a policy bill for us it is
 
02:13:43.350 --> 02:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
a rather lengthy bill that enacts a very
 
02:13:45.790 --> 02:13:45.800 align:start position:0%
simple change it allows municipalities
 
02:13:47.790 --> 02:13:47.800 align:start position:0%
to provide electronic notice via posting
 
02:13:50.149 --> 02:13:50.159 align:start position:0%
on on their website in lie of newspaper
 
02:13:51.790 --> 02:13:51.800 align:start position:0%
notice for certain
 
02:13:54.229 --> 02:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
hearings it follows last year's adoption
 
02:13:57.149 --> 02:13:57.159 align:start position:0%
of HB 1129 which allowed a planning
 
02:13:59.109 --> 02:13:59.119 align:start position:0%
board to post notice on proposed zoning
 
02:14:02.709 --> 02:14:02.719 align:start position:0%
ordinances on the website instead of in
 
02:14:05.589 --> 02:14:05.599 align:start position:0%
newspaper uh the Bill's rather lengthy
 
02:14:07.270 --> 02:14:07.280 align:start position:0%
because there are dozens of sections of
 
02:14:09.549 --> 02:14:09.559 align:start position:0%
the rsas where newspaper notice is
 
02:14:10.910 --> 02:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
required for public
 
02:14:13.270 --> 02:14:13.280 align:start position:0%
hearings uh in theory the easiest
 
02:14:15.310 --> 02:14:15.320 align:start position:0%
approach would probably be to do a
 
02:14:18.069 --> 02:14:18.079 align:start position:0%
blanket Amendment but we had to Iden
 
02:14:20.830 --> 02:14:20.840 align:start position:0%
ified two problems with that first uh
 
02:14:22.270 --> 02:14:22.280 align:start position:0%
there are a few situations where we
 
02:14:24.149 --> 02:14:24.159 align:start position:0%
weren't we didn't think that electronic
 
02:14:27.069 --> 02:14:27.079 align:start position:0%
notice would be appropriate at this time
 
02:14:29.149 --> 02:14:29.159 align:start position:0%
and so Universal rule wouldn't work
 
02:14:31.109 --> 02:14:31.119 align:start position:0%
because you'd have to have exceptions
 
02:14:35.189 --> 02:14:35.199 align:start position:0%
and secondly uh in most cases the uh
 
02:14:36.870 --> 02:14:36.880 align:start position:0%
notice requirements for the individual
 
02:14:39.870 --> 02:14:39.880 align:start position:0%
statutes also specify that there must be
 
02:14:41.990 --> 02:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
publication in the newspaper so someone
 
02:14:43.790 --> 02:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
would have to be very familiar with the
 
02:14:45.510 --> 02:14:45.520 align:start position:0%
statutes and know that there was another
 
02:14:47.629 --> 02:14:47.639 align:start position:0%
place where there was a substitute that
 
02:14:50.470 --> 02:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
said you could post on the website so in
 
02:14:52.629 --> 02:14:52.639 align:start position:0%
order to make it easier for everyone
 
02:14:54.030 --> 02:14:54.040 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the bill has to be
 
02:14:56.310 --> 02:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
somewhat lengthy uh to update all of the
 
02:14:56.320 --> 02:14:57.350 align:start position:0%
somewhat lengthy uh to update all of the
statutes

02:14:57.350 --> 02:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
statutes
 
02:14:59.549 --> 02:14:59.559 align:start position:0%
individually that's my uh concise
 
02:15:01.709 --> 02:15:01.719 align:start position:0%
summary I did submit written testimony
 
02:15:03.870 --> 02:15:03.880 align:start position:0%
that is uh to that same effect that I'm
 
02:15:06.589 --> 02:15:06.599 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions on the bill
 
02:15:06.599 --> 02:15:07.990 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions on the bill
representative

02:15:07.990 --> 02:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:15:10.109 --> 02:15:10.119 align:start position:0%
syvia thank you Mr chairman I'll be
 
02:15:12.270 --> 02:15:12.280 align:start position:0%
brief and thank you for taking my
 
02:15:14.549 --> 02:15:14.559 align:start position:0%
question um one of the ones that I
 
02:15:17.109 --> 02:15:17.119 align:start position:0%
notice is not there is uh County
 
02:15:20.910 --> 02:15:20.920 align:start position:0%
delegation noce um it was left out for a
 
02:15:24.390 --> 02:15:24.400 align:start position:0%
particular reason uh it was not uh we
 
02:15:26.669 --> 02:15:26.679 align:start position:0%
don't represent counties so we would not
 
02:15:29.470 --> 02:15:29.480 align:start position:0%
have uh proposed any sort of changes to
 
02:15:32.750 --> 02:15:32.760 align:start position:0%
those um I'll note that not all
 
02:15:36.109 --> 02:15:36.119 align:start position:0%
newspaper um notice requirements are
 
02:15:39.430 --> 02:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
listed um this is just a list of a large
 
02:15:41.589 --> 02:15:41.599 align:start position:0%
number of them um
 
02:15:43.310 --> 02:15:43.320 align:start position:0%
unfortunately in going through the
 
02:15:45.030 --> 02:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
statutes it's so cumbersome that we
 
02:15:47.510 --> 02:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
thought that to make it reasonable for
 
02:15:50.270 --> 02:15:50.280 align:start position:0%
the Comm committee to act on um limiting
 
02:15:52.069 --> 02:15:52.079 align:start position:0%
the list to probably the most important
 
02:15:54.109 --> 02:15:54.119 align:start position:0%
ones this year and then proposing
 
02:15:56.990 --> 02:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
another bill next next session uh Etc
 
02:15:59.950 --> 02:15:59.960 align:start position:0%
until we till we get them all down uh
 
02:16:01.629 --> 02:16:01.639 align:start position:0%
seemed more
 
02:16:04.870 --> 02:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate thank you representative
 
02:16:08.189 --> 02:16:08.199 align:start position:0%
mlan thank you Mr chair just super quick
 
02:16:10.830 --> 02:16:10.840 align:start position:0%
um is the driver behind this uh more on
 
02:16:13.069 --> 02:16:13.079 align:start position:0%
the cost side or more that you're
 
02:16:15.270 --> 02:16:15.280 align:start position:0%
finding it's a more effective way to
 
02:16:17.310 --> 02:16:17.320 align:start position:0%
reach people just trying to understand
 
02:16:19.069 --> 02:16:19.079 align:start position:0%
the the driver
 
02:16:21.350 --> 02:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
behind really it's a it's a very
 
02:16:23.950 --> 02:16:23.960 align:start position:0%
effective way of of reaching people um
 
02:16:26.149 --> 02:16:26.159 align:start position:0%
as I'm sure all of you know many of your
 
02:16:28.549 --> 02:16:28.559 align:start position:0%
communities are using um not only the
 
02:16:30.790 --> 02:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
websites uh for their municipalities but
 
02:16:32.589 --> 02:16:32.599 align:start position:0%
they often have linked social media
 
02:16:35.469 --> 02:16:35.479 align:start position:0%
accounts that push out updates to um
 
02:16:38.589 --> 02:16:38.599 align:start position:0%
board and chair meetings so a lot of
 
02:16:40.990 --> 02:16:41.000 align:start position:0%
people are getting their news that way
 
02:16:42.790 --> 02:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
um but of course there is a cost Factor
 
02:16:45.389 --> 02:16:45.399 align:start position:0%
as well um unfortunately a large number
 
02:16:47.790 --> 02:16:47.800 align:start position:0%
of smaller newspapers throughout our
 
02:16:50.950 --> 02:16:50.960 align:start position:0%
State have closed um meaning that the
 
02:16:53.070 --> 02:16:53.080 align:start position:0%
newspapers of General circulation are
 
02:16:55.030 --> 02:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
larger ones like the union leader and
 
02:16:58.589 --> 02:16:58.599 align:start position:0%
ads in those those cost more um so there
 
02:17:00.870 --> 02:17:00.880 align:start position:0%
will be some cost savings but I I
 
02:17:02.349 --> 02:17:02.359 align:start position:0%
wouldn't know exact numbers and that
 
02:17:03.750 --> 02:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
would depend on the individual Community
 
02:17:03.760 --> 02:17:04.870 align:start position:0%
would depend on the individual Community
I

02:17:04.870 --> 02:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
I
 
02:17:08.629 --> 02:17:08.639 align:start position:0%
imagine representative D
 
02:17:11.629 --> 02:17:11.639 align:start position:0%
Lorenzo thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:17:15.030 --> 02:17:15.040 align:start position:0%
for take my question Mr Grace um how
 
02:17:18.150 --> 02:17:18.160 align:start position:0%
does this bill intersect with RS
 
02:17:20.950 --> 02:17:20.960 align:start position:0%
91a the right to no
 
02:17:23.990 --> 02:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
bill right so RSA
 
02:17:29.030 --> 02:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
9182 uh requires uh posting in two
 
02:17:31.709 --> 02:17:31.719 align:start position:0%
public places for any notice of a
 
02:17:35.709 --> 02:17:35.719 align:start position:0%
meeting uh one of those can be a the
 
02:17:37.830 --> 02:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
municipality's website and that's
 
02:17:40.429 --> 02:17:40.439 align:start position:0%
actually um that was actually an
 
02:17:42.910 --> 02:17:42.920 align:start position:0%
amendment that occur I believe in 2018
 
02:17:42.920 --> 02:17:43.790 align:start position:0%
amendment that occur I believe in 2018
or

02:17:43.790 --> 02:17:43.800 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:17:47.230 --> 02:17:47.240 align:start position:0%
2019 um how this would play out is that
 
02:17:48.830 --> 02:17:48.840 align:start position:0%
obviously you'd have to have two public
 
02:17:50.950 --> 02:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
places and if there's also a newspaper
 
02:17:53.469 --> 02:17:53.479 align:start position:0%
requirement you'd have to find two
 
02:17:55.349 --> 02:17:55.359 align:start position:0%
separate public places so you'd have you
 
02:17:57.190 --> 02:17:57.200 align:start position:0%
know the town hall and the library the
 
02:17:59.910 --> 02:17:59.920 align:start position:0%
town hall and and the post office two
 
02:18:02.990 --> 02:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
physical locations plus the website for
 
02:18:05.070 --> 02:18:05.080 align:start position:0%
the municipality and I do want to be
 
02:18:08.230 --> 02:18:08.240 align:start position:0%
clear um that there is a provision in
 
02:18:10.389 --> 02:18:10.399 align:start position:0%
the law already that the municipality's
 
02:18:12.910 --> 02:18:12.920 align:start position:0%
website has to be a real website it
 
02:18:14.950 --> 02:18:14.960 align:start position:0%
can't be you know the the community's
 
02:18:16.750 --> 02:18:16.760 align:start position:0%
Facebook page it has to be someplace
 
02:18:18.910 --> 02:18:18.920 align:start position:0%
that's accessible to everyone who goes
 
02:18:20.950 --> 02:18:20.960 align:start position:0%
on the
 
02:18:25.110 --> 02:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
internet thank you repres Morgan uh yes
 
02:18:27.110 --> 02:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair uh thank
 
02:18:30.709 --> 02:18:30.719 align:start position:0%
you very much Mr Grace um and I I I
 
02:18:32.870 --> 02:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
think we do need to update the law like
 
02:18:34.830 --> 02:18:34.840 align:start position:0%
I see for example we talk about
 
02:18:36.669 --> 02:18:36.679 align:start position:0%
newspaper Statewide circulation we
 
02:18:38.589 --> 02:18:38.599 align:start position:0%
really only have one and even the union
 
02:18:40.709 --> 02:18:40.719 align:start position:0%
leader probably not on the news stands
 
02:18:42.950 --> 02:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
everywhere in the state but my main
 
02:18:45.270 --> 02:18:45.280 align:start position:0%
question is with the newspaper first of
 
02:18:48.349 --> 02:18:48.359 align:start position:0%
all at least in theory everybody gets it
 
02:18:50.270 --> 02:18:50.280 align:start position:0%
every copy of the newspaper is the same
 
02:18:52.870 --> 02:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
so like the ad is the same and also it's
 
02:18:55.629 --> 02:18:55.639 align:start position:0%
uh it's permanent the union leader is
 
02:18:59.429 --> 02:18:59.439 align:start position:0%
even you know archived online and on
 
02:19:01.910 --> 02:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
microfilm which actually publisher
 
02:19:03.830 --> 02:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
alluded to an unrelated Bill the other
 
02:19:06.349 --> 02:19:06.359 align:start position:0%
day so how do we do the electronic
 
02:19:10.070 --> 02:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
notice in such a way that U it's uh that
 
02:19:11.830 --> 02:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
it's definitely the same for everybody
 
02:19:14.349 --> 02:19:14.359 align:start position:0%
that an agreed person can't argue that
 
02:19:15.669 --> 02:19:15.679 align:start position:0%
what there people different people are
 
02:19:17.070 --> 02:19:17.080 align:start position:0%
getting different version of notice and
 
02:19:19.150 --> 02:19:19.160 align:start position:0%
how do we sure that it's it's it's
 
02:19:22.030 --> 02:19:22.040 align:start position:0%
permanent thank you so as far as it
 
02:19:24.709 --> 02:19:24.719 align:start position:0%
being the same for everyone um it would
 
02:19:27.870 --> 02:19:27.880 align:start position:0%
have to be uh you know it would be
 
02:19:30.709 --> 02:19:30.719 align:start position:0%
on the the municipality's web page and
 
02:19:33.230 --> 02:19:33.240 align:start position:0%
so on the front page when you go to you
 
02:19:36.950 --> 02:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
know conquer. goov or or manchester.
 
02:19:38.349 --> 02:19:38.359 align:start position:0%
goov or whatever your website is for
 
02:19:41.990 --> 02:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
your municipality um if you are posting
 
02:19:44.070 --> 02:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
notices on your front page you should
 
02:19:48.349 --> 02:19:48.359 align:start position:0%
have a either the notice itself or a
 
02:19:49.990 --> 02:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
link to direct people to where the
 
02:19:52.790 --> 02:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
calendar is um and then the calendar is
 
02:19:54.830 --> 02:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
going to be the same no matter how
 
02:19:57.710 --> 02:19:57.720 align:start position:0%
you're visiting that uh I'm not aware of
 
02:20:02.429 --> 02:20:02.439 align:start position:0%
any current uh requirement that notices
 
02:20:06.309 --> 02:20:06.319 align:start position:0%
be preserved um that would be under RSA
 
02:20:11.429 --> 02:20:11.439 align:start position:0%
33 hyphen a colon 3 hyphen a um which is
 
02:20:14.469 --> 02:20:14.479 align:start position:0%
the municipal records uh retention
 
02:20:16.349 --> 02:20:16.359 align:start position:0%
statute uh I
 
02:20:19.270 --> 02:20:19.280 align:start position:0%
don't believe that there's a requirement
 
02:20:22.389 --> 02:20:22.399 align:start position:0%
that notices of meetings are archived uh
 
02:20:24.110 --> 02:20:24.120 align:start position:0%
if that's something the committee wishes
 
02:20:29.830 --> 02:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
to uh require then uh it it could do
 
02:20:33.630 --> 02:20:33.640 align:start position:0%
so oh thank you any other
 
02:20:35.750 --> 02:20:35.760 align:start position:0%

02:24:10.750 --> 02:24:10.760 align:start position:0%
privacy this bill is a modest attempt to
 
02:24:13.550 --> 02:24:13.560 align:start position:0%
put some statutes in place to start the
 
02:24:17.030 --> 02:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
process it does not cover everything and
 
02:24:19.269 --> 02:24:19.279 align:start position:0%
future legislators will certainly find
 
02:24:20.990 --> 02:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
more areas to
 
02:24:23.550 --> 02:24:23.560 align:start position:0%
cover it does require warrants for
 
02:24:26.349 --> 02:24:26.359 align:start position:0%
governmental bodies before they Snoop
 
02:24:28.990 --> 02:24:29.000 align:start position:0%
however it does allow for an emergency
 
02:24:31.790 --> 02:24:31.800 align:start position:0%
situation your personal information
 
02:24:33.750 --> 02:24:33.760 align:start position:0%
should remain private to the extent
 
02:24:35.790 --> 02:24:35.800 align:start position:0%
possible end
 
02:24:38.150 --> 02:24:38.160 align:start position:0%

Greater detail in the interest of your

uh it's good to see you uh good morning
 
02:25:51.750 --> 02:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
to you and to members of the committee
 
02:25:53.750 --> 02:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
for the record I'm Neil Kirk I was a
 
02:25:56.590 --> 02:25:56.600 align:start position:0%
former representative and I now live as
 
02:26:00.630 --> 02:26:00.640 align:start position:0%
I have formerly in wear um I support
 
02:26:02.510 --> 02:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
this bill I think it's a very important
 
02:26:05.590 --> 02:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
first step in implementing the
 
02:26:08.269 --> 02:26:08.279 align:start position:0%
Constitutional privacy amendment that
 
02:26:11.150 --> 02:26:11.160 align:start position:0%
was recently passed by over 80% of the
 
02:26:15.190 --> 02:26:15.200 align:start position:0%
state's voters this bill does two things
 
02:26:18.150 --> 02:26:18.160 align:start position:0%
it establishes right of privacy in
 
02:26:20.910 --> 02:26:20.920 align:start position:0%
personal information that's in the hands
 
02:26:22.870 --> 02:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
of third parties
 
02:26:25.389 --> 02:26:25.399 align:start position:0%
non-government uh organizations I'll
 
02:26:28.910 --> 02:26:28.920 align:start position:0%
talk to that in a minute and it also uh
 
02:26:31.510 --> 02:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
says that the legislature not government
 
02:26:34.030 --> 02:26:34.040 align:start position:0%
agencies shall determine whether or not
 
02:26:36.550 --> 02:26:36.560 align:start position:0%
informational databases are created in
 
02:26:36.560 --> 02:26:37.349 align:start position:0%
informational databases are created in
the

02:26:37.349 --> 02:26:37.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:26:39.950 --> 02:26:39.960 align:start position:0%
future those are very two very important
 
02:26:41.230 --> 02:26:41.240 align:start position:0%
but very different
 
02:26:41.240 --> 02:26:42.910 align:start position:0%
but very different
things

02:26:42.910 --> 02:26:42.920 align:start position:0%
things
 
02:26:45.309 --> 02:26:45.319 align:start position:0%
um as you know as we go through life we
 
02:26:47.070 --> 02:26:47.080 align:start position:0%
deal with all sorts of other agen genes
 
02:26:49.070 --> 02:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
internet service providers credit card
 
02:26:51.429 --> 02:26:51.439 align:start position:0%
companies Banks telephone
 
02:26:54.269 --> 02:26:54.279 align:start position:0%
companies um social network
 
02:26:56.230 --> 02:26:56.240 align:start position:0%
organizations and we give them all sorts
 
02:26:58.150 --> 02:26:58.160 align:start position:0%
of informations to information about
 
02:27:00.030 --> 02:27:00.040 align:start position:0%
ourselves to enroll our names or
 
02:27:02.070 --> 02:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
addresses sometimes Social Security
 
02:27:05.389 --> 02:27:05.399 align:start position:0%
numbers um biometric identifiers all
 
02:27:07.950 --> 02:27:07.960 align:start position:0%
sorts of things at the
 
02:27:10.630 --> 02:27:10.640 align:start position:0%
moment these are not protected so that
 
02:27:14.230 --> 02:27:14.240 align:start position:0%
if uh a state agency or individual
 
02:27:16.790 --> 02:27:16.800 align:start position:0%
wishes to get this information and the
 
02:27:18.190 --> 02:27:18.200 align:start position:0%
private organization is willing to
 
02:27:20.150 --> 02:27:20.160 align:start position:0%
provide it that person can get that
 
02:27:22.150 --> 02:27:22.160 align:start position:0%
information without a subpoena or
 
02:27:25.469 --> 02:27:25.479 align:start position:0%
without a warrant if the agency the
 
02:27:27.190 --> 02:27:27.200 align:start position:0%
organization the private organization
 
02:27:29.590 --> 02:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
won't Supply the information uh the
 
02:27:35.190 --> 02:27:35.200 align:start position:0%
state official could get it um uh today
 
02:27:37.710 --> 02:27:37.720 align:start position:0%
um by going and getting a subpoena or a
 
02:27:40.269 --> 02:27:40.279 align:start position:0%
warrant but the point is he now can or
 
02:27:42.910 --> 02:27:42.920 align:start position:0%
she can now get it uh just simply by
 
02:27:46.110 --> 02:27:46.120 align:start position:0%
asking for it this bill would say no if
 
02:27:47.910 --> 02:27:47.920 align:start position:0%
you want personal information about an
 
02:27:50.230 --> 02:27:50.240 align:start position:0%
individual and that personal information
 
02:27:52.030 --> 02:27:52.040 align:start position:0%
is held in private hands and you're a
 
02:27:54.269 --> 02:27:54.279 align:start position:0%
government official uh then you either
 
02:27:56.710 --> 02:27:56.720 align:start position:0%
have to get a warrant or a subpoena or
 
02:27:59.269 --> 02:27:59.279 align:start position:0%
it has to be an emergency or some other
 
02:28:01.269 --> 02:28:01.279 align:start position:0%
exception that's written into the
 
02:28:04.309 --> 02:28:04.319 align:start position:0%
bill um I think that's what people
 
02:28:06.830 --> 02:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
expect that their government will not go
 
02:28:08.269 --> 02:28:08.279 align:start position:0%
about collecting this personal
 
02:28:10.710 --> 02:28:10.720 align:start position:0%
information about them uh unless the
 
02:28:13.510 --> 02:28:13.520 align:start position:0%
legislature is authorized it or unless
 
02:28:17.230 --> 02:28:17.240 align:start position:0%
they get a Judicial warrant or
 
02:28:20.309 --> 02:28:20.319 align:start position:0%
subpoena um the second part of the bill
 
02:28:22.830 --> 02:28:22.840 align:start position:0%
is equally important right now various
 
02:28:24.750 --> 02:28:24.760 align:start position:0%
agencies can create databases of
 
02:28:26.630 --> 02:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
personal information obtained
 
02:28:28.710 --> 02:28:28.720 align:start position:0%
legitimately and use it for whatever
 
02:28:31.469 --> 02:28:31.479 align:start position:0%
purposes they wish this bill says no
 
02:28:34.150 --> 02:28:34.160 align:start position:0%
that's a legislative decision um and
 
02:28:35.590 --> 02:28:35.600 align:start position:0%
there are some exceptions to this of
 
02:28:37.389 --> 02:28:37.399 align:start position:0%
course but it's a legislative decision
 
02:28:39.110 --> 02:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
the legislature will determine what
 
02:28:39.120 --> 02:28:40.269 align:start position:0%
the legislature will determine what
informational

02:28:40.269 --> 02:28:40.279 align:start position:0%
informational
 
02:28:42.590 --> 02:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
databases the state is going to create
 
02:28:45.389 --> 02:28:45.399 align:start position:0%
and state agencies will have to
 
02:28:47.429 --> 02:28:47.439 align:start position:0%
administer um
 
02:28:49.349 --> 02:28:49.359 align:start position:0%
that's the essence of the bill as
 
02:28:50.910 --> 02:28:50.920 align:start position:0%
representative Earth said this was
 
02:28:53.110 --> 02:28:53.120 align:start position:0%
passed by the house last year and got
 
02:28:54.750 --> 02:28:54.760 align:start position:0%
hung up in the Senate due to covid
 
02:28:57.230 --> 02:28:57.240 align:start position:0%
issues uh I hope the committee will see
 
02:29:00.710 --> 02:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
the wisdom of its prior actions and um
 
02:29:03.230 --> 02:29:03.240 align:start position:0%
vote the bill ought to pass thank you Mr
 
02:29:04.710 --> 02:29:04.720 align:start position:0%
chairman I'd be pleased to answer any
 
02:29:06.870 --> 02:29:06.880 align:start position:0%
questions that members may have thank
 
02:29:09.750 --> 02:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:13.790 --> 02:29:13.800 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you very much Mr uh chairman
 
02:29:19.590 --> 02:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
um uh representative Kirk um we've had a
 
02:29:23.230 --> 02:29:23.240 align:start position:0%
lot of testimony come in and I wonder if
 
02:29:25.030 --> 02:29:25.040 align:start position:0%
you could if the chair would permit me
 
02:29:29.030 --> 02:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
to ask just uh three questions the first
 
02:29:33.070 --> 02:29:33.080 align:start position:0%
is um the municipal Association claims
 
02:29:35.910 --> 02:29:35.920 align:start position:0%
that this bill's strict prohibition
 
02:29:39.230 --> 02:29:39.240 align:start position:0%
would inhibit the investigation of
 
02:29:42.750 --> 02:29:42.760 align:start position:0%
criminal offenses could you comment on
 
02:29:47.349 --> 02:29:47.359 align:start position:0%
that uh yes it doesn't um it would
 
02:29:49.790 --> 02:29:49.800 align:start position:0%
simply require that the law enforcement
 
02:29:52.510 --> 02:29:52.520 align:start position:0%
agency obtain a subpoena or a warrant in
 
02:29:54.590 --> 02:29:54.600 align:start position:0%
order to get this information it would
 
02:29:56.469 --> 02:29:56.479 align:start position:0%
prevent them from getting it as they can
 
02:29:59.110 --> 02:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
now from simply
 
02:30:01.550 --> 02:30:01.560 align:start position:0%
asking thank you may I follow up Mr
 
02:30:06.110 --> 02:30:06.120 align:start position:0%
chair May thank you um uh the New
 
02:30:08.830 --> 02:30:08.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal Association says
 
02:30:11.269 --> 02:30:11.279 align:start position:0%
that ambiguous language and strict
 
02:30:14.190 --> 02:30:14.200 align:start position:0%
liability requirement could result in
 
02:30:17.190 --> 02:30:17.200 align:start position:0%
municipalities facing sign ific
 
02:30:21.550 --> 02:30:21.560 align:start position:0%
penalties for unknowing or unintentional
 
02:30:25.670 --> 02:30:25.680 align:start position:0%
violations could you comment on that um
 
02:30:27.510 --> 02:30:27.520 align:start position:0%
first of all I I think I have more faith
 
02:30:30.750 --> 02:30:30.760 align:start position:0%
than Mr Johnston in Municipal officials
 
02:30:32.790 --> 02:30:32.800 align:start position:0%
um in the sense that they are quite
 
02:30:35.309 --> 02:30:35.319 align:start position:0%
careful and cautious and follow the
 
02:30:40.710 --> 02:30:40.720 align:start position:0%
rules um but beyond that um the penalty
 
02:30:44.269 --> 02:30:44.279 align:start position:0%
here is for violating a provision of
 
02:30:47.030 --> 02:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
this and that requires intent
 
02:30:49.469 --> 02:30:49.479 align:start position:0%
because it's a criminal act so they have
 
02:30:51.190 --> 02:30:51.200 align:start position:0%
to do something intentionally I don't
 
02:30:53.070 --> 02:30:53.080 align:start position:0%
think there would be a penalty if
 
02:30:56.110 --> 02:30:56.120 align:start position:0%
inadvertence um was the reasons reason
 
02:30:57.830 --> 02:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
for their Action Now inadvertence
 
02:31:01.429 --> 02:31:01.439 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean carelessness and sloppiness
 
02:31:04.070 --> 02:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
it means the inability they just didn't
 
02:31:05.670 --> 02:31:05.680 align:start position:0%
know they read the law and they just
 
02:31:08.309 --> 02:31:08.319 align:start position:0%
didn't understand it and didn't
 
02:31:10.830 --> 02:31:10.840 align:start position:0%
know and if I could have just one more
 
02:31:13.230 --> 02:31:13.240 align:start position:0%
this would be my last Mr chair that be
 
02:31:16.429 --> 02:31:16.439 align:start position:0%
fine representative Smith thank you Mr
 
02:31:20.510 --> 02:31:20.520 align:start position:0%
chair um the banking uh Department says
 
02:31:26.389 --> 02:31:26.399 align:start position:0%
that um the language on page two line 17
 
02:31:28.710 --> 02:31:28.720 align:start position:0%
appears to be intended to allow state
 
02:31:30.790 --> 02:31:30.800 align:start position:0%
agencies to do their jobs but this
 
02:31:32.830 --> 02:31:32.840 align:start position:0%
language would not authorize the
 
02:31:35.910 --> 02:31:35.920 align:start position:0%
department to obtain information in

examination unless it was respected
 
02:31:42.630 --> 02:31:42.640 align:start position:0%
requested with respect to a particular
 
02:31:46.590 --> 02:31:46.600 align:start position:0%
individual so that the uh Amendment uh
 
02:31:49.230 --> 02:31:49.240 align:start position:0%
or this bill would not permit uh the
 
02:31:51.630 --> 02:31:51.640 align:start position:0%

examination could you comment on that
 
02:32:06.030 --> 02:32:06.040 align:start position:0%
yes I thought that those issues in
 
02:32:08.990 --> 02:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
particular had been addressed in one or
 
02:32:15.269 --> 02:32:15.279 align:start position:0%
both of paragraph 507 H colon
 
02:32:15.279 --> 02:32:16.830 align:start position:0%

02:32:22.710 --> 02:32:22.720 align:start position:0%

bill that's available on the internet
 
02:32:28.030 --> 02:32:28.040 align:start position:0%

subparagraph a that's the paragraph that
 
02:32:33.630 --> 02:32:33.640 align:start position:0%

authorized no wait a second I I
 
02:33:03.349 --> 02:33:03.359 align:start position:0%
apologize I'm reading the wrong section
 
02:33:06.269 --> 02:33:06.279 align:start position:0%
here it's Roman

collected retained or used by any state
 
02:33:18.150 --> 02:33:18.160 align:start position:0%
regulatory agency that's the banking
 
02:33:20.429 --> 02:33:20.439 align:start position:0%
Department with respect to a particular
 
02:33:22.469 --> 02:33:22.479 align:start position:0%
individual when such acquisition
 
02:33:25.070 --> 02:33:25.080 align:start position:0%
collection retention or use is with the
 
02:33:27.110 --> 02:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
within the agency's regulatory
 
02:33:29.750 --> 02:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
adjudicatory or administrative
 
02:33:32.429 --> 02:33:32.439 align:start position:0%
function if that was intended to deal
 
02:33:34.429 --> 02:33:34.439 align:start position:0%
with the situation that I think you
 
02:33:36.550 --> 02:33:36.560 align:start position:0%
described representative Smith but if it
 
02:33:39.750 --> 02:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
is not um then perhaps some language and
 
02:33:41.750 --> 02:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to try to draft it in
 
02:33:45.349 --> 02:33:45.359 align:start position:0%
conjunction with uh commissioner little
 
02:33:47.510 --> 02:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
um this was designed to solve that
 
02:33:51.190 --> 02:33:51.200 align:start position:0%
problem the idea of this paragraph uh
 
02:33:53.830 --> 02:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
four was to make sure that Regulatory
 
02:33:56.030 --> 02:33:56.040 align:start position:0%
Agencies could continue to collect this
 
02:33:57.469 --> 02:33:57.479 align:start position:0%
information if it was in their
 
02:33:59.830 --> 02:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
Regulatory purview and certainly the
 
02:34:02.030 --> 02:34:02.040 align:start position:0%
kind of activity that was described by
 
02:34:03.550 --> 02:34:03.560 align:start position:0%
representative Smith is within the
 
02:34:05.910 --> 02:34:05.920 align:start position:0%
purview of the banking
 
02:34:08.710 --> 02:34:08.720 align:start position:0%
Department um thank you very much for
 
02:34:10.750 --> 02:34:10.760 align:start position:0%
that I will just point out that that is
 
02:34:14.590 --> 02:34:14.600 align:start position:0%
the exact language that the banking uh
 
02:34:17.870 --> 02:34:17.880 align:start position:0%
department is challenging so um it might
 
02:34:20.950 --> 02:34:20.960 align:start position:0%
be um if you could come up with
 
02:34:24.230 --> 02:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
something that helps to satisfy the
 
02:34:26.670 --> 02:34:26.680 align:start position:0%
banking department since we thought it
 
02:34:28.750 --> 02:34:28.760 align:start position:0%
had been addressed that would be helpful
 
02:34:30.950 --> 02:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for indulging me uh
 
02:34:33.030 --> 02:34:33.040 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I will make that effort
 
02:34:35.990 --> 02:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
representative Smith representative B
 
02:34:40.870 --> 02:34:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:43.190 --> 02:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
question no I was simply going to point
 
02:34:46.070 --> 02:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
out what uh representative Smith just
 
02:34:48.469 --> 02:34:48.479 align:start position:0%
pointed out that the language in that
 
02:34:51.830 --> 02:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
section referring to Ani an individual
 
02:34:54.469 --> 02:34:54.479 align:start position:0%
is what the banking commissioner was uh
 
02:34:57.870 --> 02:34:57.880 align:start position:0%
having problems with so no additional
 
02:35:00.550 --> 02:35:00.560 align:start position:0%
question are there any other questions
 
02:35:02.950 --> 02:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
for representative Kirk yes
 
02:35:02.960 --> 02:35:07.790 align:start position:0%
for representative Kirk yes
representative

02:35:07.790 --> 02:35:07.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:10.349 --> 02:35:10.359 align:start position:0%
Langley representative Kirk I'm go I'm
 
02:35:13.389 --> 02:35:13.399 align:start position:0%
looking at number five ran num
 
02:35:16.150 --> 02:35:16.160 align:start position:0%
five and it says any person violating
 
02:35:17.670 --> 02:35:17.680 align:start position:0%
provisions of this section shall be
 
02:35:19.750 --> 02:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
guilty of a violation if a natural
 
02:35:21.990 --> 02:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
person or guilty of a misdemeanor if any
 
02:35:25.230 --> 02:35:25.240 align:start position:0%
other person how would I have any idea
 
02:35:28.269 --> 02:35:28.279 align:start position:0%
or determine that my rights had been
 
02:35:31.710 --> 02:35:31.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:34.070 --> 02:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
provision I'm just I'm having a hard
 
02:35:37.110 --> 02:35:37.120 align:start position:0%
time understanding how how the consumer
 
02:35:39.429 --> 02:35:39.439 align:start position:0%
would know that um their rights have
 
02:35:39.439 --> 02:35:40.269 align:start position:0%
would know that um their rights have
been

02:35:40.269 --> 02:35:40.279 align:start position:0%
been
 
02:35:43.230 --> 02:35:43.240 align:start position:0%
violated section five representative
 
02:35:46.030 --> 02:35:46.040 align:start position:0%
Langley deals with a Criminal
 
02:35:48.590 --> 02:35:48.600 align:start position:0%
prosecution a violation is a criminal
 
02:35:51.110 --> 02:35:51.120 align:start position:0%
act a misdemeanor is a is a punishment
 
02:35:54.190 --> 02:35:54.200 align:start position:0%
for a criminal act so the individual
 
02:35:56.870 --> 02:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
would not be prosecuting in that case
 
02:35:59.750 --> 02:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
however section six six is perhaps the
 
02:36:01.630 --> 02:36:01.640 align:start position:0%
one you're referring to a person who
 
02:36:05.469 --> 02:36:05.479 align:start position:0%
suffers injury can sue um that's always
 
02:36:08.469 --> 02:36:08.479 align:start position:0%
a problem in these situations it the
 
02:36:12.309 --> 02:36:12.319 align:start position:0%
bill does nothing to um help an
 
02:36:14.590 --> 02:36:14.600 align:start position:0%
individual determine whether his or her
 
02:36:18.550 --> 02:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
rights have been violated and um I share
 
02:36:21.590 --> 02:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
your concern I'm not aware of a method
 
02:36:25.309 --> 02:36:25.319 align:start position:0%
to uh address that issue but certainly
 
02:36:27.030 --> 02:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
if you found out that your name was
 
02:36:29.230 --> 02:36:29.240 align:start position:0%
included in a database and the database
 
02:36:30.870 --> 02:36:30.880 align:start position:0%
for example had not been authorized by
 
02:36:35.349 --> 02:36:35.359 align:start position:0%
the legislature or if for example um you
 
02:36:39.110 --> 02:36:39.120 align:start position:0%
were involved in some sort of
 
02:36:41.870 --> 02:36:41.880 align:start position:0%
um relationship with a state agency and
 
02:36:43.550 --> 02:36:43.560 align:start position:0%
they had information about you that you
 
02:36:45.590 --> 02:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
hadn't provided and you believed that
 
02:36:47.950 --> 02:36:47.960 align:start position:0%
they had gotten it elsewhere you could
 
02:36:50.349 --> 02:36:50.359 align:start position:0%
inquire and ask how they got it and that
 
02:36:53.309 --> 02:36:53.319 align:start position:0%
could form the basis for your suit but
 
02:36:55.550 --> 02:36:55.560 align:start position:0%
to be very Frank it that's a difficult
 
02:36:57.710 --> 02:36:57.720 align:start position:0%
situation much of the legislation we
 
02:37:00.070 --> 02:37:00.080 align:start position:0%
pass how does one learn that his rights
 
02:37:01.070 --> 02:37:01.080 align:start position:0%
have been
 
02:37:03.269 --> 02:37:03.279 align:start position:0%
violated I'm sorry I don't have a better
 
02:37:06.309 --> 02:37:06.319 align:start position:0%
answer thank you representative any
 
02:37:06.319 --> 02:37:07.469 align:start position:0%
answer thank you representative any
other

02:37:07.469 --> 02:37:07.479 align:start position:0%
other
 
02:37:10.230 --> 02:37:10.240 align:start position:0%
questions representa KK seeing none
 
02:37:12.190 --> 02:37:12.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony today thank
 
02:37:13.710 --> 02:37:13.720 align:start position:0%
you Mr
 
02:37:17.429 --> 02:37:17.439 align:start position:0%
chairman uh
 
02:37:21.550 --> 02:37:21.560 align:start position:0%
what we again we're behind schedule so
 
02:37:24.190 --> 02:37:24.200 align:start position:0%
I'm going to ask everyone if they
 
02:37:26.790 --> 02:37:26.800 align:start position:0%
could keep their testimony to three
 
02:37:28.790 --> 02:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
minutes it would be greatly
 
02:37:31.429 --> 02:37:31.439 align:start position:0%
appreciated and well since since there
 
02:37:32.990 --> 02:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
have been inquiries in that regard I'll
 
02:37:36.870 --> 02:37:36.880 align:start position:0%
call upon uh Piera doino attorney doino
 
02:37:40.670 --> 02:37:40.680 align:start position:0%
I think to uh to speak next she's from
 
02:37:44.790 --> 02:37:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:44.800 --> 02:37:47.950 align:start position:0%
 
Department

02:37:47.950 --> 02:37:47.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:50.110 --> 02:37:50.120 align:start position:0%
hi my name is Kiara dolino I'm the
 
02:37:51.670 --> 02:37:51.680 align:start position:0%
general counsel at the New Hampshire
 
02:37:54.429 --> 02:37:54.439 align:start position:0%
banking Department um and as as you
 
02:37:56.790 --> 02:37:56.800 align:start position:0%
heard uh the concern that the department
 
02:37:59.710 --> 02:37:59.720 align:start position:0%
has and um we have presented testimony
 
02:38:01.750 --> 02:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner little has testimony um
 
02:38:03.389 --> 02:38:03.399 align:start position:0%
that he's presented for you
 
02:38:06.110 --> 02:38:06.120 align:start position:0%
unfortunately he can't be here today um
 
02:38:08.349 --> 02:38:08.359 align:start position:0%
the concern is with the provisions in
 
02:38:12.510 --> 02:38:12.520 align:start position:0%
section um four Roman 4 in F proposed
 
02:38:12.520 --> 02:38:14.110 align:start position:0%
section um four Roman 4 in F proposed
507

02:38:14.110 --> 02:38:14.120 align:start position:0%
507
 
02:38:16.710 --> 02:38:16.720 align:start position:0%
d-h colon 2
 
02:38:18.510 --> 02:38:18.520 align:start position:0%
um that provision we believe was
 
02:38:21.030 --> 02:38:21.040 align:start position:0%
intended to permit Regulatory Agencies
 
02:38:24.190 --> 02:38:24.200 align:start position:0%
to um engage in their usual practices of
 
02:38:26.630 --> 02:38:26.640 align:start position:0%
obtaining information from third-party
 
02:38:29.230 --> 02:38:29.240 align:start position:0%
providers however the language in that
 
02:38:31.590 --> 02:38:31.600 align:start position:0%
provision that references a particular
 
02:38:34.950 --> 02:38:34.960 align:start position:0%
individual is a concern because we often
 
02:38:37.750 --> 02:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
in our examinations and in other uh work
 
02:38:40.030 --> 02:38:40.040 align:start position:0%
do not request information about a
 
02:38:43.309 --> 02:38:43.319 align:start position:0%
particular individual um we for example
 
02:38:46.429 --> 02:38:46.439 align:start position:0%
would do an examination and request
 
02:38:49.429 --> 02:38:49.439 align:start position:0%
um from a bank or other financial
 
02:38:52.070 --> 02:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
institution um information about say a
 
02:38:55.190 --> 02:38:55.200 align:start position:0%
period of Time how many loans uh give us
 
02:38:56.710 --> 02:38:56.720 align:start position:0%
all the loans you've done within this
 
02:38:59.190 --> 02:38:59.200 align:start position:0%
time frame we have no idea who the
 
02:39:01.309 --> 02:39:01.319 align:start position:0%
consumers are for the information we're
 
02:39:03.550 --> 02:39:03.560 align:start position:0%
obtaining we would have no way of having
 
02:39:06.190 --> 02:39:06.200 align:start position:0%
those names before we ask for the
 
02:39:08.830 --> 02:39:08.840 align:start position:0%
information so our concern is that that
 
02:39:10.990 --> 02:39:11.000 align:start position:0%
provision would not allow us to do our
 
02:39:13.429 --> 02:39:13.439 align:start position:0%
our usual work in examining Banks and
 
02:39:16.309 --> 02:39:16.319 align:start position:0%
other financial institutions um the same
 
02:39:17.830 --> 02:39:17.840 align:start position:0%
would apply if we're investigating
 
02:39:20.349 --> 02:39:20.359 align:start position:0%
wrongful conduct we would ask the
 
02:39:22.150 --> 02:39:22.160 align:start position:0%
institution please provide us with the
 
02:39:23.950 --> 02:39:23.960 align:start position:0%
names of all and the information about
 
02:39:25.550 --> 02:39:25.560 align:start position:0%
all consumers who might have been
 
02:39:27.910 --> 02:39:27.920 align:start position:0%
impacted again we don't know in advance
 
02:39:29.830 --> 02:39:29.840 align:start position:0%
the names of the consumers so we're not
 
02:39:31.830 --> 02:39:31.840 align:start position:0%
asking for information about a
 
02:39:31.840 --> 02:39:32.990 align:start position:0%
asking for information about a
particular

02:39:32.990 --> 02:39:33.000 align:start position:0%
particular
 
02:39:35.550 --> 02:39:35.560 align:start position:0%
individual so those are our concerns and
 
02:39:37.269 --> 02:39:37.279 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer any
 
02:39:43.190 --> 02:39:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:45.389 --> 02:39:45.399 align:start position:0%

02:40:01.670 --> 02:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:03.910 --> 02:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
Moore thank you Mr chairman and members
 
02:40:05.950 --> 02:40:05.960 align:start position:0%

name is Greg Moore and I am the state
 
02:40:09.269 --> 02:40:09.279 align:start position:0%
director with Americans for Prosperity

New Hampshire and I am testifying today
 
02:40:12.469 --> 02:40:12.479 align:start position:0%
in support of House Bill
 
02:40:15.710 --> 02:40:15.720 align:start position:0%
597 AFP supports House Bill 597 which
 
02:40:16.950 --> 02:40:16.960 align:start position:0%
protects the Privacy rights of New
 
02:40:18.710 --> 02:40:18.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens the legislation
 
02:40:20.790 --> 02:40:20.800 align:start position:0%
outlines several categories of personal
 
02:40:22.910 --> 02:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
information that individuals would
 
02:40:24.870 --> 02:40:24.880 align:start position:0%
retain priv a privacy interest in even
 
02:40:26.309 --> 02:40:26.319 align:start position:0%
when that information is given to a
 
02:40:29.230 --> 02:40:29.240 align:start position:0%
third party uh this bill really helps to
 
02:40:30.990 --> 02:40:31.000 align:start position:0%
put meat on the bones of the new part
 
02:40:33.950 --> 02:40:33.960 align:start position:0%
one article 2B which explicitly codifies
 
02:40:35.510 --> 02:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
the right to privacy in New Hampshire's
 
02:40:37.910 --> 02:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
Constitution veteran members of this
 
02:40:40.750 --> 02:40:40.760 align:start position:0%
committee may remember that uh AFP
 
02:40:43.190 --> 02:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
supported cacr 16 which moved through
 
02:40:45.190 --> 02:40:45.200 align:start position:0%
house Judiciary in 2018 and eventually
 
02:40:45.200 --> 02:40:46.349 align:start position:0%
house Judiciary in 2018 and eventually
became

02:40:46.349 --> 02:40:46.359 align:start position:0%
became
 
02:40:48.950 --> 02:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
part one article 2B this legislation
 
02:40:50.710 --> 02:40:50.720 align:start position:0%
begins to put in place parameters for
 
02:40:52.349 --> 02:40:52.359 align:start position:0%
that Amendment without waiting years for
 
02:40:54.830 --> 02:40:54.840 align:start position:0%
the courts to develop case law as far as
 
02:40:56.349 --> 02:40:56.359 align:start position:0%
the specifics of the bill in order to
 
02:40:58.150 --> 02:40:58.160 align:start position:0%
benefit from technology like social
 
02:41:01.150 --> 02:41:01.160 align:start position:0%
media and email we give information to
 
02:41:04.070 --> 02:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
private entities constantly in 1979 the
 
02:41:05.830 --> 02:41:05.840 align:start position:0%
US Supreme Court held that Americans had
 
02:41:07.710 --> 02:41:07.720 align:start position:0%
no privacy interest in information that
 
02:41:09.150 --> 02:41:09.160 align:start position:0%
they voluntarily gave to private
 
02:41:11.710 --> 02:41:11.720 align:start position:0%
companies thus the numbers uh you call
 
02:41:13.309 --> 02:41:13.319 align:start position:0%
on your cell phone your internet search
 
02:41:15.070 --> 02:41:15.080 align:start position:0%
history and much more information that
 
02:41:17.389 --> 02:41:17.399 align:start position:0%
regul passes through cell phone provide
 
02:41:19.309 --> 02:41:19.319 align:start position:0%
providers and internet service providers
 
02:41:20.590 --> 02:41:20.600 align:start position:0%
can be given to the state government
 
02:41:22.110 --> 02:41:22.120 align:start position:0%
with or local governments without any
 
02:41:24.910 --> 02:41:24.920 align:start position:0%
judicial oversight the expectations of
 
02:41:27.150 --> 02:41:27.160 align:start position:0%
privacy Americans have in your data no
 
02:41:29.230 --> 02:41:29.240 align:start position:0%
longer matches today's legal Reality
 
02:41:32.349 --> 02:41:32.359 align:start position:0%
House Bill 597 changes that by adding a
 
02:41:33.790 --> 02:41:33.800 align:start position:0%
warrant or subpoena requirement for
 
02:41:35.670 --> 02:41:35.680 align:start position:0%
personal information that we we should
 
02:41:37.469 --> 02:41:37.479 align:start position:0%
all have an interest in protecting this
 
02:41:39.309 --> 02:41:39.319 align:start position:0%
will clarify privacy protections for
 
02:41:41.150 --> 02:41:41.160 align:start position:0%
both law enforcement and the public in a
 
02:41:42.870 --> 02:41:42.880 align:start position:0%
constructive way consistent with our
 
02:41:45.070 --> 02:41:45.080 align:start position:0%
state's Constitution the Supreme Court
 
02:41:47.230 --> 02:41:47.240 align:start position:0%
us Supreme Court has started to slowly
 
02:41:48.870 --> 02:41:48.880 align:start position:0%
update Fourth Amendment Juris Prudence
 
02:41:50.710 --> 02:41:50.720 align:start position:0%
to reflect the Norms of our increasingly
 
02:41:53.309 --> 02:41:53.319 align:start position:0%
Digital Society but we need not wait for
 
02:41:54.950 --> 02:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
the federal courts to inch towards
 
02:41:56.990 --> 02:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
updating the Fourth Amendment as Justice
 
02:41:59.389 --> 02:41:59.399 align:start position:0%
Alo said in the Riley versus California
 
02:42:01.630 --> 02:42:01.640 align:start position:0%
case quote it would be very unfortunate
 
02:42:03.469 --> 02:42:03.479 align:start position:0%
if privacy Protections in the 21st
 
02:42:05.510 --> 02:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
century were left primarily to to the
 
02:42:07.150 --> 02:42:07.160 align:start position:0%
courts using the blunt instrument of the
 
02:42:09.469 --> 02:42:09.479 align:start position:0%
force Amendment legislatures elected by
 
02:42:11.630 --> 02:42:11.640 align:start position:0%
the majority are in a better position
 
02:42:13.269 --> 02:42:13.279 align:start position:0%
than we are to assess and respond to
 
02:42:14.910 --> 02:42:14.920 align:start position:0%
changes that have already occurred and
 
02:42:16.429 --> 02:42:16.439 align:start position:0%
those that most likely it will take
 
02:42:18.870 --> 02:42:18.880 align:start position:0%
place in the future close quote uh we
 
02:42:20.910 --> 02:42:20.920 align:start position:0%
think that house bill 597 is a a
 
02:42:23.389 --> 02:42:23.399 align:start position:0%
statutory scalpel molding the Privacy
 
02:42:25.389 --> 02:42:25.399 align:start position:0%
protections of people for of people in
 
02:42:27.309 --> 02:42:27.319 align:start position:0%
the state in a valuable way it
 
02:42:29.110 --> 02:42:29.120 align:start position:0%
recognizes the role the legislature has
 
02:42:31.070 --> 02:42:31.080 align:start position:0%
in creating privacy protections would
 
02:42:32.830 --> 02:42:32.840 align:start position:0%
also work in tandem with a new
 
02:42:35.190 --> 02:42:35.200 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment to clarify how
 
02:42:36.670 --> 02:42:36.680 align:start position:0%
it would work in practice for those
 
02:42:38.750 --> 02:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
reasons we support House Bill 597 and
 
02:42:40.670 --> 02:42:40.680 align:start position:0%
urge the committee to find it ought to
 
02:42:42.429 --> 02:42:42.439 align:start position:0%
pass um I'd be happy to take any
 
02:42:44.830 --> 02:42:44.840 align:start position:0%

02:43:38.309 --> 02:43:38.319 align:start position:0%
name is Kyle Baker and I'm with the firm
 
02:43:39.910 --> 02:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
wrath young and ping nalii and I'm here
 
02:43:42.110 --> 02:43:42.120 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the internet Coalition in
 
02:43:44.269 --> 02:43:44.279 align:start position:0%
opposition to House Bill
 
02:43:47.190 --> 02:43:47.200 align:start position:0%
597 um I'll be very brief um we have
 
02:43:48.830 --> 02:43:48.840 align:start position:0%
submitted some written testimony that
 
02:43:51.429 --> 02:43:51.439 align:start position:0%
goes in- depth into our concerns um and
 
02:43:52.750 --> 02:43:52.760 align:start position:0%
we just wanted to highlight a couple of
 
02:43:54.590 --> 02:43:54.600 align:start position:0%
key points and some real world examples
 
02:43:56.870 --> 02:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
where we think this legislation may have
 
02:43:59.309 --> 02:43:59.319 align:start position:0%
some unintended consequences um our
 
02:44:00.590 --> 02:44:00.600 align:start position:0%
members are keenly aware of our
 
02:44:02.269 --> 02:44:02.279 align:start position:0%
customers expectations and rights of
 
02:44:03.750 --> 02:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
privacy particularly when it comes to
 
02:44:05.870 --> 02:44:05.880 align:start position:0%
their personal information uh digital
 
02:44:07.950 --> 02:44:07.960 align:start position:0%
privacy is the focus of considerable
 
02:44:09.830 --> 02:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
attention at the federal level which is
 
02:44:11.469 --> 02:44:11.479 align:start position:0%
where we believe data security laws are
 
02:44:13.830 --> 02:44:13.840 align:start position:0%
best addressed um technology does not
 
02:44:16.030 --> 02:44:16.040 align:start position:0%
stop at the state border and a patchwork
 
02:44:17.550 --> 02:44:17.560 align:start position:0%
of state laws will only lead to a
 
02:44:19.429 --> 02:44:19.439 align:start position:0%
confusing and burdensome process for
 
02:44:22.750 --> 02:44:22.760 align:start position:0%
both providers and consumers um two
 
02:44:24.590 --> 02:44:24.600 align:start position:0%
quick real world examples that we
 
02:44:26.190 --> 02:44:26.200 align:start position:0%
thought would be helpful in highlighting
 
02:44:30.670 --> 02:44:30.680 align:start position:0%
some of our concerns um this legislation
 
02:44:33.030 --> 02:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
um would forbid government agencies from
 
02:44:34.630 --> 02:44:34.640 align:start position:0%
acquiring retaining obtaining or even
 
02:44:36.670 --> 02:44:36.680 align:start position:0%
using an address telephone number or
 
02:44:39.309 --> 02:44:39.319 align:start position:0%
email address of any person even for
 
02:44:42.590 --> 02:44:42.600 align:start position:0%
basic um benign functions um such as
 
02:44:45.790 --> 02:44:45.800 align:start position:0%
marketing or you know promotion of
 
02:44:47.750 --> 02:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
things that state agencies are doing um
 
02:44:50.550 --> 02:44:50.560 align:start position:0%
an example could be that the state parks
 
02:44:52.349 --> 02:44:52.359 align:start position:0%
division wanted to promote changes at
 
02:44:54.269 --> 02:44:54.279 align:start position:0%
one of its Parks or send out an update
 
02:44:57.429 --> 02:44:57.439 align:start position:0%
of new park hours um section two of this
 
02:44:59.630 --> 02:44:59.640 align:start position:0%
bill would specifically prohibit them
 
02:45:01.710 --> 02:45:01.720 align:start position:0%
from using any contact info whether
 
02:45:04.510 --> 02:45:04.520 align:start position:0%
there's a physical address email address
 
02:45:06.230 --> 02:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
or phone number to invb the public
 
02:45:07.790 --> 02:45:07.800 align:start position:0%
unless someone had specifically reached
 
02:45:10.269 --> 02:45:10.279 align:start position:0%
out to the department looking for this
 
02:45:14.790 --> 02:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
information um a second um concern and
 
02:45:16.590 --> 02:45:16.600 align:start position:0%
examp example that we wanted to provide
 
02:45:19.670 --> 02:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
is around the use of mailing lists
 
02:45:21.150 --> 02:45:21.160 align:start position:0%
whether it's for online charity
 
02:45:23.309 --> 02:45:23.319 align:start position:0%
fundraisers political or political
 
02:45:25.230 --> 02:45:25.240 align:start position:0%
campaigning section three of this bill
 
02:45:29.230 --> 02:45:29.240 align:start position:0%
would specifically prohibit um
 
02:45:30.750 --> 02:45:30.760 align:start position:0%
government contractors or elected
 
02:45:32.309 --> 02:45:32.319 align:start position:0%
officials from maintaining any sort of
 
02:45:33.990 --> 02:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
personal information in a database that
 
02:45:36.309 --> 02:45:36.319 align:start position:0%
wasn't specifically authorized by the
 
02:45:38.469 --> 02:45:38.479 align:start position:0%
legislature um so with that I just will
 
02:45:40.469 --> 02:45:40.479 align:start position:0%
wrap up and refer to our written
 
02:45:41.950 --> 02:45:41.960 align:start position:0%
testimony and just say that the
 
02:45:43.429 --> 02:45:43.439 align:start position:0%
protection of personal information
 
02:45:45.830 --> 02:45:45.840 align:start position:0%
continues to be of utmost concern to the
 
02:45:47.590 --> 02:45:47.600 align:start position:0%
internet Coalition and its members
 
02:45:48.790 --> 02:45:48.800 align:start position:0%
however we believe that this bill would
 
02:45:51.510 --> 02:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
do more harm than good it raises issues
 
02:45:53.469 --> 02:45:53.479 align:start position:0%
of compliance for multi-state National
 
02:45:55.469 --> 02:45:55.479 align:start position:0%
businesses but equally important in its
 
02:45:57.429 --> 02:45:57.439 align:start position:0%
Simplicity raises issues of adequate
 
02:45:59.309 --> 02:45:59.319 align:start position:0%
protection for consumers we would
 
02:46:01.550 --> 02:46:01.560 align:start position:0%
therefore ask you to oppose this Bill
 
02:46:04.590 --> 02:46:04.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time thank you any
 
02:46:08.429 --> 02:46:08.439 align:start position:0%
other there any questions for Mr Baker
 
02:46:12.630 --> 02:46:12.640 align:start position:0%
Baker seeing none thank you for your
 
02:46:15.830 --> 02:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
testimony next person would be
 
02:46:15.840 --> 02:46:21.349 align:start position:0%
testimony next person would be
Kathy

02:46:21.349 --> 02:46:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:23.510 --> 02:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
Stacy good morning Mr chairman can you
 
02:46:27.349 --> 02:46:27.359 align:start position:0%
hear me good yes thank you I'm Kathy
 
02:46:28.990 --> 02:46:29.000 align:start position:0%
Stacy I'm the Rockingham County register
 
02:46:32.670 --> 02:46:32.680 align:start position:0%
of deeds and I am uh testifying neither
 
02:46:35.230 --> 02:46:35.240 align:start position:0%
in support or nor in opposition however
 
02:46:38.950 --> 02:46:38.960 align:start position:0%
we do as the Registries of Deeds do have
 
02:46:41.990 --> 02:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh obviously Grant to a grantee indexes
 
02:46:43.590 --> 02:46:43.600 align:start position:0%
that are available to the public and
 
02:46:45.550 --> 02:46:45.560 align:start position:0%
third party vendors and everybody else
 
02:46:48.389 --> 02:46:48.399 align:start position:0%
we're concerned about this bill um to
 
02:46:53.230 --> 02:46:53.240 align:start position:0%
make sure that we are exempt um from the
 
02:46:56.550 --> 02:46:56.560 align:start position:0%
uh obviously the violation of of what
 
02:46:58.670 --> 02:46:58.680 align:start position:0%
these Provisions are to make sure that
 
02:47:01.190 --> 02:47:01.200 align:start position:0%
we are absolutely covered because as you
 
02:47:03.469 --> 02:47:03.479 align:start position:0%
know you can go online to basically all
 
02:47:06.670 --> 02:47:06.680 align:start position:0%
10 counties and do whatever research you
 
02:47:10.230 --> 02:47:10.240 align:start position:0%
wish and we have names we have addresses
 
02:47:12.469 --> 02:47:12.479 align:start position:0%
you know that our index is by name only
 
02:47:14.030 --> 02:47:14.040 align:start position:0%
but you can it's a guide to the
 
02:47:16.030 --> 02:47:16.040 align:start position:0%
documents and you can look at documents
 
02:47:17.590 --> 02:47:17.600 align:start position:0%
and you can get information about
 
02:47:19.110 --> 02:47:19.120 align:start position:0%
Banking and you can get information
 
02:47:21.550 --> 02:47:21.560 align:start position:0%
about addresses and and so forth so
 
02:47:24.230 --> 02:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
we're concerned obviously to make sure
 
02:47:26.950 --> 02:47:26.960 align:start position:0%
what type of liability this type of bill
 
02:47:31.230 --> 02:47:31.240 align:start position:0%
is going to um cause the counties so
 
02:47:33.550 --> 02:47:33.560 align:start position:0%
that's pretty much my testimony and I
 
02:47:35.469 --> 02:47:35.479 align:start position:0%
will take any
 
02:47:37.670 --> 02:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
questions thank thank you very much for
 
02:47:41.070 --> 02:47:41.080 align:start position:0%
your testimony and other there any
 
02:47:44.710 --> 02:47:44.720 align:start position:0%
questions Stacy seeing none thank you
 
02:47:46.870 --> 02:47:46.880 align:start position:0%
very very much thank you very much have
 
02:47:49.429 --> 02:47:49.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:05.150 --> 02:48:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:07.990 --> 02:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
Grace thank you Mr chair I'm n Grace
 
02:48:09.830 --> 02:48:09.840 align:start position:0%
with the New Hampshire Municipal
 
02:48:12.030 --> 02:48:12.040 align:start position:0%
Association uh obviously from
 
02:48:14.389 --> 02:48:14.399 align:start position:0%
representative Smith's comments earlier
 
02:48:16.230 --> 02:48:16.240 align:start position:0%
uh you you've received our written
 
02:48:20.309 --> 02:48:20.319 align:start position:0%
testimony we do oppose this bill we are
 
02:48:22.790 --> 02:48:22.800 align:start position:0%
concerned about the ambiguous language
 
02:48:24.670 --> 02:48:24.680 align:start position:0%
um we
 
02:48:27.469 --> 02:48:27.479 align:start position:0%
do to the to the extent that I can
 
02:48:30.750 --> 02:48:30.760 align:start position:0%
respond to Mr Kirk's uh remarks earlier
 
02:48:32.990 --> 02:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
um we are concerned that the way this
 
02:48:35.349 --> 02:48:35.359 align:start position:0%
bill is written there that there would
 
02:48:39.510 --> 02:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
be strict liability so that if there was
 
02:48:41.830 --> 02:48:41.840 align:start position:0%
if there was a violation whether or not
 
02:48:45.230 --> 02:48:45.240 align:start position:0%
intentional um that would be uh that
 
02:48:47.830 --> 02:48:47.840 align:start position:0%
would result in liability attaching to
 
02:48:50.150 --> 02:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
the government agency particularly for
 
02:48:50.160 --> 02:48:51.349 align:start position:0%
the government agency particularly for
us

02:48:51.349 --> 02:48:51.359 align:start position:0%
us
 
02:48:54.190 --> 02:48:54.200 align:start position:0%
municipalities and therefore um there
 
02:48:57.910 --> 02:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
would be unintentional consequences um
 
02:48:59.269 --> 02:48:59.279 align:start position:0%
and those are outlined in my written
 
02:49:01.469 --> 02:49:01.479 align:start position:0%
testimony I'm more than happy to take
 
02:49:03.710 --> 02:49:03.720 align:start position:0%
questions uh since I I am trying to keep
 
02:49:05.110 --> 02:49:05.120 align:start position:0%
in mind how late the committee is
 
02:49:07.710 --> 02:49:07.720 align:start position:0%
running thank you very much are there
 
02:49:11.190 --> 02:49:11.200 align:start position:0%
any questions for attorney
 
02:49:15.030 --> 02:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
Graves seeing none thank you again last
 
02:49:18.349 --> 02:49:18.359 align:start position:0%
person who pre-registered to testify is
 
02:49:18.359 --> 02:49:32.630 align:start position:0%
person who pre-registered to testify is
Maya

02:49:32.630 --> 02:49:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:35.429 --> 02:49:35.439 align:start position:0%
McKenzie thank you Mr chairman my name
 
02:49:37.550 --> 02:49:37.560 align:start position:0%
is my name is Maya McKenzie and I'm
 
02:49:38.910 --> 02:49:38.920 align:start position:0%
representing the state privacy and
 
02:49:41.429 --> 02:49:41.439 align:start position:0%
security Coalition I am respectfully
 
02:49:45.070 --> 02:49:45.080 align:start position:0%
testifying in opposition to HB 597 we've
 
02:49:46.790 --> 02:49:46.800 align:start position:0%
submitted written testimony but I'd like
 
02:49:48.670 --> 02:49:48.680 align:start position:0%
to highlight uh just a couple of
 
02:49:51.630 --> 02:49:51.640 align:start position:0%
ambiguities in light of our time uh the
 
02:49:54.429 --> 02:49:54.439 align:start position:0%
first is that this bill would create a
 
02:49:56.309 --> 02:49:56.319 align:start position:0%
very ambiguous right expectation of
 
02:49:58.710 --> 02:49:58.720 align:start position:0%
privacy and personal information uh but
 
02:50:00.349 --> 02:50:00.359 align:start position:0%
there is great uncertainty around the
 
02:50:01.990 --> 02:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
information to which this new right
 
02:50:04.990 --> 02:50:05.000 align:start position:0%
would apply the bill creates the bill
 
02:50:07.110 --> 02:50:07.120 align:start position:0%
applies to personal information content
 
02:50:09.670 --> 02:50:09.680 align:start position:0%
and usage however content and usage are
 
02:50:12.309 --> 02:50:12.319 align:start position:0%
undefined leaving both individuals and
 
02:50:14.269 --> 02:50:14.279 align:start position:0%
disclosing entities alike without
 
02:50:16.830 --> 02:50:16.840 align:start position:0%
clarity on what information is covered
 
02:50:19.150 --> 02:50:19.160 align:start position:0%
by this proposed uh expectation of
 
02:50:22.990 --> 02:50:23.000 align:start position:0%
privacy second uh this bill does not
 
02:50:25.110 --> 02:50:25.120 align:start position:0%
appropriately consider the degree to
 
02:50:26.910 --> 02:50:26.920 align:start position:0%
which federal law intersects and
 
02:50:29.429 --> 02:50:29.439 align:start position:0%
protects many types of information that
 
02:50:31.990 --> 02:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
are described in the bill such as health
 
02:50:34.190 --> 02:50:34.200 align:start position:0%
information through Hippa financial
 
02:50:36.150 --> 02:50:36.160 align:start position:0%
information with the Graham leech B act
 
02:50:38.990 --> 02:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
and others the private right of action
 
02:50:40.910 --> 02:50:40.920 align:start position:0%
that allows individuals to sue for
 
02:50:42.630 --> 02:50:42.640 align:start position:0%
statutory damages if there has been a
 
02:50:44.950 --> 02:50:44.960 align:start position:0%
violation for this vague and over raw
 
02:50:47.229 --> 02:50:47.239 align:start position:0%
provision would lead to a surge in class
 
02:50:49.510 --> 02:50:49.520 align:start position:0%
action litigation which rarely results
 
02:50:52.150 --> 02:50:52.160 align:start position:0%
in recovery Plains in privacy related
 
02:50:53.950 --> 02:50:53.960 align:start position:0%
claims but more importantly this
 
02:50:56.790 --> 02:50:56.800 align:start position:0%
frustrates Public Safety efforts uh
 
02:50:59.469 --> 02:50:59.479 align:start position:0%
first the exception uh to the private
 
02:51:02.670 --> 02:51:02.680 align:start position:0%
right of action which applies to um
 
02:51:04.790 --> 02:51:04.800 align:start position:0%
corporations would not apply to
 
02:51:07.349 --> 02:51:07.359 align:start position:0%
disclosures to County agencies so
 
02:51:09.110 --> 02:51:09.120 align:start position:0%
disclosures to County agencies such as
 
02:51:11.389 --> 02:51:11.399 align:start position:0%
the sheriff or a nursing home would
 
02:51:13.870 --> 02:51:13.880 align:start position:0%
result in a potential $1,000 per
 
02:51:17.030 --> 02:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
violation p penalty plus attorney fees
 
02:51:19.950 --> 02:51:19.960 align:start position:0%
second this exception only applies to
 
02:51:21.990 --> 02:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
corporations exposing non-corporate
 
02:51:24.190 --> 02:51:24.200 align:start position:0%
entities to class action risk so
 
02:51:26.229 --> 02:51:26.239 align:start position:0%
organizations and public Charities like
 
02:51:28.309 --> 02:51:28.319 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's children trust which you
 
02:51:31.269 --> 02:51:31.279 align:start position:0%
know advocates for uh Child Protection
 
02:51:32.750 --> 02:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
should have the ability to make
 
02:51:35.190 --> 02:51:35.200 align:start position:0%
disclosures that support the public good
 
02:51:36.830 --> 02:51:36.840 align:start position:0%
without the threat of diverting
 
02:51:39.070 --> 02:51:39.080 align:start position:0%
resources and funds to defend against
 
02:51:41.429 --> 02:51:41.439 align:start position:0%
litigation um in the in this earlier
 
02:51:43.429 --> 02:51:43.439 align:start position:0%
testimony the sponsor stated there would
 
02:51:44.950 --> 02:51:44.960 align:start position:0%
be no litigation risk risk for
 
02:51:47.469 --> 02:51:47.479 align:start position:0%
inadvertent or unintentional disclosures
 
02:51:50.030 --> 02:51:50.040 align:start position:0%
in violation of the bill however there
 
02:51:52.229 --> 02:51:52.239 align:start position:0%
is no such language in this bill that
 
02:51:54.670 --> 02:51:54.680 align:start position:0%
would provide Clarity on that issue so
 
02:51:57.389 --> 02:51:57.399 align:start position:0%
for these reasons we oppose respectfully
 
02:52:00.030 --> 02:52:00.040 align:start position:0%
House Bill 597 and ask that you not move
 
02:52:01.830 --> 02:52:01.840 align:start position:0%

02:52:03.349 --> 02:52:03.359 align:start position:0%
consideration on these matters and
 
02:52:04.990 --> 02:52:05.000 align:start position:0%

questions thank you for your testimony
 
02:52:11.429 --> 02:52:11.439 align:start position:0%

02:52:14.110 --> 02:52:14.120 align:start position:0%
McKenzie seeing none thank you for your
 
02:52:16.830 --> 02:52:16.840 align:start position:0%
testimon morning that concludes the list
 
02:52:18.590 --> 02:52:18.600 align:start position:0%
of pre-registered there are a couple of
 
02:52:20.229 --> 02:52:20.239 align:start position:0%
people who do have their hands up who
 
02:52:22.790 --> 02:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
wish to testify first appears to be
 
02:52:28.269 --> 02:52:28.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:30.950 --> 02:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
Keller thank you Mr chairman and members
 
02:52:31.750 --> 02:52:31.760 align:start position:0%

committee um I excuse me I uh thank you
 
02:52:38.269 --> 02:52:38.279 align:start position:0%
for entertaining my testimony and
 
02:52:42.950 --> 02:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
opposition of HB 597 in his current form
 
02:52:45.870 --> 02:52:45.880 align:start position:0%
um protection of unreasonable search and
 
02:52:49.870 --> 02:52:49.880 align:start position:0%
seizures have been eroded over uh ever
 
02:52:52.550 --> 02:52:52.560 align:start position:0%
since the electronic age started um
 
02:52:54.349 --> 02:52:54.359 align:start position:0%
partic and that's because they're not
 
02:52:56.830 --> 02:52:56.840 align:start position:0%
clear protections and safeguards in law
 
02:52:59.469 --> 02:52:59.479 align:start position:0%
um Snowden revealed that there were
 
02:53:01.870 --> 02:53:01.880 align:start position:0%
secret decisions that collection of
 
02:53:04.389 --> 02:53:04.399 align:start position:0%
personal information didn't constitute a
 
02:53:07.590 --> 02:53:07.600 align:start position:0%
search until they actually ran uh a
 
02:53:09.269 --> 02:53:09.279 align:start position:0%
search on the information that was
 
02:53:09.279 --> 02:53:10.870 align:start position:0%
search on the information that was
collected

02:53:10.870 --> 02:53:10.880 align:start position:0%
collected
 
02:53:14.830 --> 02:53:14.840 align:start position:0%
and there I I think uh representative
 
02:53:18.269 --> 02:53:18.279 align:start position:0%
Langley for bringing up the issue that
 
02:53:21.389 --> 02:53:21.399 align:start position:0%
we as individuals often don't know that
 
02:53:23.990 --> 02:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
our rights have been violated um I
 
02:53:26.950 --> 02:53:26.960 align:start position:0%
believe it was representative Langley um
 
02:53:29.790 --> 02:53:29.800 align:start position:0%
that mentioned that and uh this
 
02:53:31.870 --> 02:53:31.880 align:start position:0%
information really needs to
 
02:53:37.750 --> 02:53:37.760 align:start position:0%
be uh kept private and uh the S search
 
02:53:43.309 --> 02:53:43.319 align:start position:0%
warrant needs to be uh presented to the
 
02:53:45.150 --> 02:53:45.160 align:start position:0%
the individual who's records are trying
 
02:53:46.670 --> 02:53:46.680 align:start position:0%
to be searched so that they have an
 
02:53:49.349 --> 02:53:49.359 align:start position:0%
opportunity to to challenge that the
 
02:53:53.150 --> 02:53:53.160 align:start position:0%
reasonableness of the request and um so
 
02:53:55.830 --> 02:53:55.840 align:start position:0%
I think that there is uh significant
 
02:53:55.840 --> 02:53:56.910 align:start position:0%
I think that there is uh significant
potential

02:53:56.910 --> 02:53:56.920 align:start position:0%
potential
 
02:54:00.790 --> 02:54:00.800 align:start position:0%
for erosion of people's uh privacy
 
02:54:03.070 --> 02:54:03.080 align:start position:0%
rights if this bill was to pass in its
 
02:54:05.950 --> 02:54:05.960 align:start position:0%
current form um there's currently
 
02:54:07.910 --> 02:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
already a statute
 
02:54:09.790 --> 02:54:09.800 align:start position:0%
644a that
 
02:54:13.710 --> 02:54:13.720 align:start position:0%
addresses the protection of people's uh
 
02:54:17.550 --> 02:54:17.560 align:start position:0%
location data and it does not seem that
 
02:54:20.830 --> 02:54:20.840 align:start position:0%
this uh these protections listed in this
 
02:54:22.110 --> 02:54:22.120 align:start position:0%
bill HB
 
02:54:26.910 --> 02:54:26.920 align:start position:0%
597 uh reflect the the wise decision of
 
02:54:31.950 --> 02:54:31.960 align:start position:0%
this the the state house and um to to
 
02:54:36.070 --> 02:54:36.080 align:start position:0%
put those Protections in law and this
 
02:54:39.269 --> 02:54:39.279 align:start position:0%
would actually open up what is currently
 
02:54:42.389 --> 02:54:42.399 align:start position:0%
not allowed to be shared because this
 
02:54:44.429 --> 02:54:44.439 align:start position:0%
bill has far more exceptions than is
 
02:54:46.110 --> 02:54:46.120 align:start position:0%
currently allowed in
 
02:54:48.590 --> 02:54:48.600 align:start position:0%
644a specifically The subpoena
 
02:54:53.790 --> 02:54:53.800 align:start position:0%
requirement which only has uh a level
 
02:54:56.750 --> 02:54:56.760 align:start position:0%
of uh requirement that the request is
 
02:54:58.630 --> 02:54:58.640 align:start position:0%
not unreasonable oppressive and
 
02:55:02.469 --> 02:55:02.479 align:start position:0%
excessive in scope whereas the
 
02:55:04.990 --> 02:55:05.000 align:start position:0%
the the search warrant requirement
 
02:55:06.510 --> 02:55:06.520 align:start position:0%
requires probable cause and
 
02:55:10.150 --> 02:55:10.160 align:start position:0%
particularize suspicion also uh
 
02:55:14.790 --> 02:55:14.800 align:start position:0%
644a expands on the 911 exception
 
02:55:17.110 --> 02:55:17.120 align:start position:0%
and flushes it out so that instead of
 
02:55:20.030 --> 02:55:20.040 align:start position:0%
using vague language it actually is
 
02:55:23.030 --> 02:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
clear on what is allowed and what is not
 
02:55:26.349 --> 02:55:26.359 align:start position:0%
also 644a addresses the emergency
 
02:55:28.550 --> 02:55:28.560 align:start position:0%
exception in this bill it currently just
 
02:55:33.429 --> 02:55:33.439 align:start position:0%
says an emergency and uh
 
02:55:36.469 --> 02:55:36.479 align:start position:0%
644a flushes that out to what does that
 
02:55:39.790 --> 02:55:39.800 align:start position:0%
actually mean and so um there's also a
 
02:55:42.950 --> 02:55:42.960 align:start position:0%
broad exception for Regulatory Agencies
 
02:55:45.630 --> 02:55:45.640 align:start position:0%
which has been uh hammered home uh I
 
02:55:48.710 --> 02:55:48.720 align:start position:0%
think by previous testimony as being an
 
02:55:53.229 --> 02:55:53.239 align:start position:0%
issue I incl conclusion I think that uh
 
02:55:55.630 --> 02:55:55.640 align:start position:0%
we need to really address this issue in
 
02:55:59.349 --> 02:55:59.359 align:start position:0%
conjunction with the and informed by
 
02:56:02.750 --> 02:56:02.760 align:start position:0%
644a and the protection that offers
 
02:56:05.870 --> 02:56:05.880 align:start position:0%
especially because it uh talks about in
 
02:56:09.670 --> 02:56:09.680 align:start position:0%
this bill uh the location data um also
 
02:56:12.309 --> 02:56:12.319 align:start position:0%
being protected and so it would be two
 
02:56:14.830 --> 02:56:14.840 align:start position:0%
statutes addressing the same
 
02:56:17.670 --> 02:56:17.680 align:start position:0%
uh issue with two different levels of
 
02:56:21.349 --> 02:56:21.359 align:start position:0%
protection so I'm happy to uh work with
 
02:56:24.150 --> 02:56:24.160 align:start position:0%
this this committee on this bill and the
 
02:56:28.030 --> 02:56:28.040 align:start position:0%
sponsors and I hope that the that uh the
 
02:56:31.070 --> 02:56:31.080 align:start position:0%
the committee would retain this and we
 
02:56:32.389 --> 02:56:32.399 align:start position:0%
can work over the summer with the
 
02:56:34.630 --> 02:56:34.640 align:start position:0%
different uh stakeholders and I'm happy
 
02:56:36.950 --> 02:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
to take any questions thank you you any
 
02:56:40.710 --> 02:56:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:43.309 --> 02:56:43.319 align:start position:0%
y seean thank you for your testimony
 
02:56:45.229 --> 02:56:45.239 align:start position:0%
today thank you for your patience
 
02:56:48.550 --> 02:56:48.560 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you okay and the next
 
02:56:52.830 --> 02:56:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:56.309 --> 02:56:56.319 align:start position:0%
head we're running way behind so if you
 
02:56:58.389 --> 02:56:58.399 align:start position:0%
could try to make your testimony as
 
02:57:00.750 --> 02:57:00.760 align:start position:0%
succinct as possible it would be greatly
 
02:57:03.110 --> 02:57:03.120 align:start position:0%
appreciated great um thank you Mr
 
02:57:04.150 --> 02:57:04.160 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you members of the
 
02:57:05.630 --> 02:57:05.640 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Richard HED I'm the
 
02:57:07.309 --> 02:57:07.319 align:start position:0%
government Affairs coordinator for the
 
02:57:09.590 --> 02:57:09.600 align:start position:0%
judicial branch um I just wanted to
 
02:57:11.830 --> 02:57:11.840 align:start position:0%
point to a written correspondence I had
 
02:57:14.070 --> 02:57:14.080 align:start position:0%
previously filed relative to the effect
 
02:57:16.590 --> 02:57:16.600 align:start position:0%
Ive date um I think this bill triggers
 
02:57:21.309 --> 02:57:21.319 align:start position:0%
rsa1 14 colon 9-a which would um require
 
02:57:23.950 --> 02:57:23.960 align:start position:0%
that the effective date be January 1
 
02:57:26.990 --> 02:57:27.000 align:start position:0%
2022 instead of upon passage If This
 
02:57:30.349 --> 02:57:30.359 align:start position:0%
Were to go forward um and and that's
 
02:57:32.710 --> 02:57:32.720 align:start position:0%
basically to allow the judicial branch
 
02:57:34.910 --> 02:57:34.920 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to with the hundreds of
 
02:57:37.309 --> 02:57:37.319 align:start position:0%
changes that are made to update our
 
02:57:42.150 --> 02:57:42.160 align:start position:0%
database systems to uh ensure that that
 
02:57:44.070 --> 02:57:44.080 align:start position:0%
um notice has gone out to all la
 
02:57:46.469 --> 02:57:46.479 align:start position:0%
enforcement regarding uh changes on
 
02:57:48.590 --> 02:57:48.600 align:start position:0%
criminal code and this includes a
 
02:57:50.910 --> 02:57:50.920 align:start position:0%
provision that that has criminal
 
02:57:53.309 --> 02:57:53.319 align:start position:0%
penalties um secondly which is not
 
02:57:55.950 --> 02:57:55.960 align:start position:0%
contained in my letter um I note that on
 
02:57:58.630 --> 02:57:58.640 align:start position:0%
page two um where they have the
 
02:58:01.990 --> 02:58:02.000 align:start position:0%
exceptions it refers to State agencies
 
02:58:04.750 --> 02:58:04.760 align:start position:0%
or state departments and agencies um
 
02:58:06.269 --> 02:58:06.279 align:start position:0%
that receive information as part of
 
02:58:08.110 --> 02:58:08.120 align:start position:0%
their normal duties the judicial
 
02:58:10.630 --> 02:58:10.640 align:start position:0%
branches is probably not a state agency
 
02:58:13.670 --> 02:58:13.680 align:start position:0%
or uh Department um and probably should
 
02:58:16.389 --> 02:58:16.399 align:start position:0%
be included within that list as
 
02:58:18.469 --> 02:58:18.479 align:start position:0%
receiving on a on a regular basis
 
02:58:20.990 --> 02:58:21.000 align:start position:0%
through pleadings and filings um
 
02:58:22.990 --> 02:58:23.000 align:start position:0%
information that would be considered
 
02:58:25.590 --> 02:58:25.600 align:start position:0%
confidential or personal information
 
02:58:27.110 --> 02:58:27.120 align:start position:0%
with that I'd be happy to answer any
 
02:58:28.550 --> 02:58:28.560 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much for your
 
02:58:31.630 --> 02:58:31.640 align:start position:0%

02:58:35.790 --> 02:58:35.800 align:start position:0%

02:58:48.309 --> 02:58:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:50.190 --> 02:58:50.200 align:start position:0%
thank you so much uh Mr chairman and I
 
02:58:53.070 --> 02:58:53.080 align:start position:0%
will be very brief um I represent uh
 
02:58:56.630 --> 02:58:56.640 align:start position:0%
techet we are a National Organization of
 
02:58:57.990 --> 02:58:58.000 align:start position:0%
companies throughout the Innovation
 
02:59:00.389 --> 02:59:00.399 align:start position:0%
economy uh just wanted to bring up one
 
02:59:02.950 --> 02:59:02.960 align:start position:0%
particular point of concern for our
 
02:59:05.389 --> 02:59:05.399 align:start position:0%
members uh it's unclear under the
 
02:59:08.469 --> 02:59:08.479 align:start position:0%
legislation uh whether companies when
 
02:59:12.670 --> 02:59:12.680 align:start position:0%
being uh requested information by the
 
02:59:14.389 --> 02:59:14.399 align:start position:0%
state agencies
 
02:59:16.790 --> 02:59:16.800 align:start position:0%
should refuse access or seek legal
 
02:59:19.190 --> 02:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
counsel as to whether the request falls
 
02:59:21.469 --> 02:59:21.479 align:start position:0%
under the agency's purview and therefore
 
02:59:23.910 --> 02:59:23.920 align:start position:0%
be allowed under Roman numeral 4 uh
 
02:59:25.590 --> 02:59:25.600 align:start position:0%
essentially concerned that this puts
 
02:59:27.550 --> 02:59:27.560 align:start position:0%
them in a situation where they have to
 
02:59:29.429 --> 02:59:29.439 align:start position:0%
choose between failing to comply with a
 
02:59:32.990 --> 02:59:33.000 align:start position:0%
state request or risk litigation for
 
02:59:35.590 --> 02:59:35.600 align:start position:0%
complying um that compounded with the
 
02:59:38.269 --> 02:59:38.279 align:start position:0%
private right of action uh and that
 
02:59:40.750 --> 02:59:40.760 align:start position:0%
makes the uh unclarity here uh
 
02:59:42.590 --> 02:59:42.600 align:start position:0%
particularly concerning again thank you
 
02:59:44.349 --> 02:59:44.359 align:start position:0%
very much for your Indulgence I we did
 
02:59:47.269 --> 02:59:47.279 align:start position:0%

297 which brings us to our last hearing
 
03:00:38.309 --> 03:00:38.319 align:start position:0%
of the morning I'd like to take a break
 
03:00:40.510 --> 03:00:40.520 align:start position:0%
but since there are people who appeared
 
03:00:42.710 --> 03:00:42.720 align:start position:0%
here to
 
03:00:44.870 --> 03:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
testify and they've been waiting a half
 
03:00:46.630 --> 03:00:46.640 align:start position:0%
an hour I just assume go ahead with the
 
03:00:49.990 --> 03:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
hearing if we can and get it done uh
 
03:00:52.590 --> 03:00:52.600 align:start position:0%
limit the testimony if I can as best I
 
03:00:54.830 --> 03:00:54.840 align:start position:0%
can to a couple of minutes for each
 
03:00:57.269 --> 03:00:57.279 align:start position:0%
person this is so we'll open the hearing
 
03:00:59.469 --> 03:00:59.479 align:start position:0%
on House Bill
 
03:01:02.150 --> 03:01:02.160 align:start position:0%
288 I'm going to note that there are six
 
03:01:03.870 --> 03:01:03.880 align:start position:0%
people who registered in advance in
 
03:01:07.389 --> 03:01:07.399 align:start position:0%
support and 48 people who registered in
 
03:01:11.750 --> 03:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
opposition and with uh and with regard
 
03:01:14.389 --> 03:01:14.399 align:start position:0%
to the people who registered to test ify
 
03:01:16.630 --> 03:01:16.640 align:start position:0%
11 people registered to testify and

every single one of them registered in
 
03:01:22.990 --> 03:01:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:26.070 --> 03:01:26.080 align:start position:0%
so the bill is the primary sponsor of
 
03:01:29.229 --> 03:01:29.239 align:start position:0%
this bill is representative BOS and if
 
03:01:31.309 --> 03:01:31.319 align:start position:0%

um chairman abbis grabbed me this
 
03:02:20.030 --> 03:02:20.040 align:start position:0%
morning on my way to the gym so pardon
 
03:02:21.990 --> 03:02:22.000 align:start position:0%
me if I seem a little unprepared for
 
03:02:24.030 --> 03:02:24.040 align:start position:0%
this he got called away to an emergency
 
03:02:27.750 --> 03:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
meeting he could not get out of um so
 
03:02:32.429 --> 03:02:32.439 align:start position:0%
this bill HP 288 repeals RSA 679 the
 
03:02:34.830 --> 03:02:34.840 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board the housing appeal
 
03:02:37.150 --> 03:02:37.160 align:start position:0%
board was presented on its merits last
 
03:02:41.030 --> 03:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
year and it failed to gain any ground
 
03:02:43.670 --> 03:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
the policy was passed eventually because
 
03:02:46.630 --> 03:02:46.640 align:start position:0%
it was included in the budget and to
 
03:02:49.030 --> 03:02:49.040 align:start position:0%
avoid the government shutdown the budget
 
03:02:51.349 --> 03:02:51.359 align:start position:0%
was voted for and it was included and
 
03:02:55.110 --> 03:02:55.120 align:start position:0%
passed um barring some change in
 
03:02:57.070 --> 03:02:57.080 align:start position:0%
circumstances um the governor has
 
03:02:59.750 --> 03:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
represented that he would sign a bill
 
03:03:03.349 --> 03:03:03.359 align:start position:0%
that would uh change this and if if it
 
03:03:06.030 --> 03:03:06.040 align:start position:0%
made it to his desk eliminating this
 
03:03:08.070 --> 03:03:08.080 align:start position:0%
board would save New Hampshire taxpayers
 
03:03:11.110 --> 03:03:11.120 align:start position:0%
nearly half a million dollars per year
 
03:03:12.950 --> 03:03:12.960 align:start position:0%
uh overwhelmingly the majority of
 
03:03:14.910 --> 03:03:14.920 align:start position:0%
support for housing Bill board came from
 
03:03:17.389 --> 03:03:17.399 align:start position:0%
Real Estate developers however these
 
03:03:19.670 --> 03:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
developers created a board that follows
 
03:03:21.990 --> 03:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
nearly the same procedures as the appeal
 
03:03:24.790 --> 03:03:24.800 align:start position:0%
process if it were filed in Superior
 
03:03:27.469 --> 03:03:27.479 align:start position:0%
Court one particular concerning section
 
03:03:30.309 --> 03:03:30.319 align:start position:0%
of the housing appeals board statute RSA
 
03:03:33.910 --> 03:03:33.920 align:start position:0%
679 col 7 Roman
 
03:03:36.710 --> 03:03:36.720 align:start position:0%
2 the prime sponsor believes that this
 
03:03:39.510 --> 03:03:39.520 align:start position:0%
would allow for land developers who was
 
03:03:41.590 --> 03:03:41.600 align:start position:0%
has standing to transfer a petition
 
03:03:43.950 --> 03:03:43.960 align:start position:0%
previously filed in the Superior Court
 
03:03:45.870 --> 03:03:45.880 align:start position:0%
to the housing appeal board over the
 
03:03:48.309 --> 03:03:48.319 align:start position:0%
objection of the petitioner who filed in
 
03:03:50.590 --> 03:03:50.600 align:start position:0%
Superior Court provided the land
 
03:03:53.790 --> 03:03:53.800 align:start position:0%
developer has standing um we do not need
 
03:03:55.309 --> 03:03:55.319 align:start position:0%
this board at the state level making
 
03:03:57.229 --> 03:03:57.239 align:start position:0%
decisions undermining local control of
 
03:03:57.239 --> 03:03:59.070 align:start position:0%
decisions undermining local control of
our

03:03:59.070 --> 03:03:59.080 align:start position:0%
our
 
03:04:01.229 --> 03:04:01.239 align:start position:0%
communities and that's the introduction
 
03:04:03.630 --> 03:04:03.640 align:start position:0%
for the bill representative abbis has
 
03:04:05.389 --> 03:04:05.399 align:start position:0%
told me that he intends to be here
 
03:04:08.790 --> 03:04:08.800 align:start position:0%
before the end of this hearing to take
 
03:04:10.750 --> 03:04:10.760 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much for your
 
03:04:15.710 --> 03:04:15.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:17.510 --> 03:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
do any of the committee members have
 
03:04:20.229 --> 03:04:20.239 align:start position:0%
questions for representative
 
03:04:23.429 --> 03:04:23.439 align:start position:0%
Roy see none again thank
 
03:04:42.349 --> 03:04:42.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:45.870 --> 03:04:45.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:49.030 --> 03:04:49.040 align:start position:0%
you oh there he is
 
03:04:51.110 --> 03:04:51.120 align:start position:0%
yeah good morning Mr chairman and
 
03:04:52.469 --> 03:04:52.479 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
03:04:54.790 --> 03:04:54.800 align:start position:0%
Bob G state senator District
 
03:04:59.229 --> 03:04:59.239 align:start position:0%
2 and uh if you will the originator of
 
03:05:02.590 --> 03:05:02.600 align:start position:0%
the housing appeals board ladies and
 
03:05:04.070 --> 03:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
gentlemen the committee we exist to
 
03:05:07.150 --> 03:05:07.160 align:start position:0%
solve problems in our state right now we
 
03:05:09.150 --> 03:05:09.160 align:start position:0%
have a vacancy rate of
 
03:05:11.990 --> 03:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
1% uh and people literally for example
 
03:05:13.309 --> 03:05:13.319 align:start position:0%
on the headlines in the conquered
 
03:05:14.910 --> 03:05:14.920 align:start position:0%
monitor this morning being thrown out of
 
03:05:18.710 --> 03:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
their houses uh so that uh rents can be
 
03:05:20.830 --> 03:05:20.840 align:start position:0%
raised certainly appropriate the problem
 
03:05:23.030 --> 03:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
is we have no
 
03:05:25.389 --> 03:05:25.399 align:start position:0%
inventory that is the result of a number
 
03:05:28.389 --> 03:05:28.399 align:start position:0%
of problems systemically over the years
 
03:05:30.269 --> 03:05:30.279 align:start position:0%
um not the least of which has been the
 
03:05:32.750 --> 03:05:32.760 align:start position:0%
time it takes for developers to get
 
03:05:34.510 --> 03:05:34.520 align:start position:0%
their projects through the
 
03:05:37.830 --> 03:05:37.840 align:start position:0%
system um they go to a series of
 
03:05:40.750 --> 03:05:40.760 align:start position:0%
meetings with respective land use boards
 
03:05:41.990 --> 03:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
in the
 
03:05:46.830 --> 03:05:46.840 align:start position:0%
community and if the land use board uh
 
03:05:49.349 --> 03:05:49.359 align:start position:0%
declines to permit the project then what
 
03:05:51.990 --> 03:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
happens is it goes to Superior Court if
 
03:05:55.309 --> 03:05:55.319 align:start position:0%
the developer chooses to go this is a
 
03:05:58.349 --> 03:05:58.359 align:start position:0%
process that's expensive time consuming
 
03:06:00.229 --> 03:06:00.239 align:start position:0%
and very frequently results in the in
 
03:06:02.990 --> 03:06:03.000 align:start position:0%
the um erosion of financial support
 
03:06:06.070 --> 03:06:06.080 align:start position:0%
necessary to fund these projects bear in
 
03:06:08.030 --> 03:06:08.040 align:start position:0%
mind this is this is not
 
03:06:10.429 --> 03:06:10.439 align:start position:0%
about Section 8 housing this is about
 
03:06:13.349 --> 03:06:13.359 align:start position:0%
Workforce housing and serving on finance
 
03:06:15.269 --> 03:06:15.279 align:start position:0%
Ways and Means in the senate for now my
 
03:06:17.790 --> 03:06:17.800 align:start position:0%
fifth year I can tell you that more than
 
03:06:19.710 --> 03:06:19.720 align:start position:0%
a few companies that have looked to come
 
03:06:21.429 --> 03:06:21.439 align:start position:0%
here good companies have declined to do
 
03:06:24.110 --> 03:06:24.120 align:start position:0%
so because we have no housing stock part
 
03:06:26.269 --> 03:06:26.279 align:start position:0%
of the problem for that is part of the
 
03:06:28.710 --> 03:06:28.720 align:start position:0%
reason for that is that we've not been
 
03:06:30.750 --> 03:06:30.760 align:start position:0%
able to build because much of our
 
03:06:33.269 --> 03:06:33.279 align:start position:0%
projects are tied up in courts that take
 
03:06:35.110 --> 03:06:35.120 align:start position:0%
time energy and
 
03:06:39.110 --> 03:06:39.120 align:start position:0%
material this bill in no way allows a
 
03:06:40.590 --> 03:06:40.600 align:start position:0%
contrary to the remarks of the previous
 
03:06:42.870 --> 03:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
speaker allows someone to jump back and
 
03:06:45.510 --> 03:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
forth between the courts and the housing
 
03:06:47.190 --> 03:06:47.200 align:start position:0%
appeals boards very explicitly stated in
 
03:06:49.670 --> 03:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
the legislation a person gets to choose
 
03:06:52.309 --> 03:06:52.319 align:start position:0%
one or the other and if they choose the
 
03:06:54.469 --> 03:06:54.479 align:start position:0%
one then any action in the other is
 
03:06:57.910 --> 03:06:57.920 align:start position:0%
stayed and the
 
03:07:01.750 --> 03:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
um uh the process moves forward what's
 
03:07:03.630 --> 03:07:03.640 align:start position:0%
important in this in this panel is that
 
03:07:06.389 --> 03:07:06.399 align:start position:0%
it has 180 days to arrive at a decision
 
03:07:08.229 --> 03:07:08.239 align:start position:0%
it does not override decisions of
 
03:07:09.790 --> 03:07:09.800 align:start position:0%
planning boards it does not establish
 
03:07:12.110 --> 03:07:12.120 align:start position:0%
new laws it just merely makes certain
 
03:07:14.389 --> 03:07:14.399 align:start position:0%
that planning boards and land use boards
 
03:07:17.190 --> 03:07:17.200 align:start position:0%
abide by state laws on Workforce housing
 
03:07:19.110 --> 03:07:19.120 align:start position:0%
and abide by their own ordinances in
 
03:07:21.190 --> 03:07:21.200 align:start position:0%
more than a few instances this is not
 
03:07:24.429 --> 03:07:24.439 align:start position:0%
been the case so this board now has two
 
03:07:26.750 --> 03:07:26.760 align:start position:0%
cases before it I invite you to review
 
03:07:28.670 --> 03:07:28.680 align:start position:0%
the letters submitted by the newly
 
03:07:30.950 --> 03:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
appointed chair uh of the housing
 
03:07:33.750 --> 03:07:33.760 align:start position:0%
appeals board uh and having now been
 
03:07:36.190 --> 03:07:36.200 align:start position:0%
started and already seeing processes
 
03:07:37.590 --> 03:07:37.600 align:start position:0%
moving forward that will significantly
 
03:07:39.429 --> 03:07:39.439 align:start position:0%
expedite the construction of housing by
 
03:07:41.030 --> 03:07:41.040 align:start position:0%
resolving these differences between
 
03:07:43.190 --> 03:07:43.200 align:start position:0%
planning boards and developers without
 
03:07:45.630 --> 03:07:45.640 align:start position:0%
having to resort to the court system I
 
03:07:48.070 --> 03:07:48.080 align:start position:0%
would ask that you support uh the
 
03:07:49.990 --> 03:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board and vote in
 
03:07:51.990 --> 03:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
opposition to House Bill 288 and I will
 
03:07:53.389 --> 03:07:53.399 align:start position:0%
take any
 
03:07:57.389 --> 03:07:57.399 align:start position:0%
questions any questions for Senator
 
03:08:00.469 --> 03:08:00.479 align:start position:0%
guid seeing no questions thank you for
 
03:08:02.670 --> 03:08:02.680 align:start position:0%

Barry

03:08:16.910 --> 03:08:16.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:19.870 --> 03:08:19.880 align:start position:0%

03:08:27.389 --> 03:08:27.399 align:start position:0%
Justice for New Hampshire legal
 
03:08:29.309 --> 03:08:29.319 align:start position:0%
assistance where I've been practicing
 
03:08:31.950 --> 03:08:31.960 align:start position:0%
law as it relates to housing in almost
 
03:08:36.750 --> 03:08:36.760 align:start position:0%
every aspect for about 44 years um I
 
03:08:40.070 --> 03:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
just want to be really quick about this
 
03:08:41.990 --> 03:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
first of all I think a lot of the
 
03:08:43.910 --> 03:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
opponents assume
 
03:08:46.910 --> 03:08:46.920 align:start position:0%
that this board is going to be extremely
 
03:08:48.429 --> 03:08:48.439 align:start position:0%
friendly to
 
03:08:52.590 --> 03:08:52.600 align:start position:0%
developers um what I would suggest is
 
03:08:55.910 --> 03:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
that look you have the three members are
 
03:08:59.229 --> 03:08:59.239 align:start position:0%
appointed by the Supreme Court who I as
 
03:09:02.229 --> 03:09:02.239 align:start position:0%
far as I know has never had an antioc
 
03:09:05.550 --> 03:09:05.560 align:start position:0%
bias um and then the other member by
 
03:09:09.389 --> 03:09:09.399 align:start position:0%
Statute is a land a land surveyor uh or
 
03:09:10.590 --> 03:09:10.600 align:start position:0%
a uh an
 
03:09:13.830 --> 03:09:13.840 align:start position:0%
engineer I think the they're applying
 
03:09:16.070 --> 03:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
the same law that the Superior Court
 
03:09:20.550 --> 03:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
would apply and I think the only reason
 
03:09:22.870 --> 03:09:22.880 align:start position:0%
that more housing will be developed from
 
03:09:27.670 --> 03:09:27.680 align:start position:0%
this is that projects will not go under
 
03:09:30.269 --> 03:09:30.279 align:start position:0%
because of the time and expense of
 
03:09:32.990 --> 03:09:33.000 align:start position:0%
Superior Court litigation and there's no
 
03:09:35.030 --> 03:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
reason that development should not
 
03:09:38.349 --> 03:09:38.359 align:start position:0%
happen because of the delays and expense
 
03:09:41.510 --> 03:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
of litigation thanks to this the housing
 
03:09:43.670 --> 03:09:43.680 align:start position:0%
appeals board legisl
 
03:09:45.710 --> 03:09:45.720 align:start position:0%
people will not have to hire lawyers
 
03:09:47.670 --> 03:09:47.680 align:start position:0%
decisions will generally be made within
 
03:09:50.349 --> 03:09:50.359 align:start position:0%
a six Monon period The Rules of Evidence
 
03:09:53.030 --> 03:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
won't apply and in fact you probably
 
03:09:56.110 --> 03:09:56.120 align:start position:0%
have more expertise on the board than
 
03:09:59.229 --> 03:09:59.239 align:start position:0%
you would in superior court because the
 
03:10:01.190 --> 03:10:01.200 align:start position:0%
statute says that all these people have
 
03:10:04.389 --> 03:10:04.399 align:start position:0%
to be experienced in uh land use
 
03:10:07.030 --> 03:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
development or Housing Development a
 
03:10:09.550 --> 03:10:09.560 align:start position:0%
great majority I think of the Superior
 
03:10:11.950 --> 03:10:11.960 align:start position:0%
Court are people who are forers
 
03:10:13.870 --> 03:10:13.880 align:start position:0%
Attorneys General
 
03:10:16.269 --> 03:10:16.279 align:start position:0%
um who have no reasonably they have any
 
03:10:18.870 --> 03:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
background in local land use laws so the
 
03:10:20.710 --> 03:10:20.720 align:start position:0%
bottom line I mean the other thing that
 
03:10:24.830 --> 03:10:24.840 align:start position:0%
just makes sense is that this board has
 
03:10:27.870 --> 03:10:27.880 align:start position:0%
been up and running for about a month
 
03:10:30.710 --> 03:10:30.720 align:start position:0%
maybe a month and a half you know would
 
03:10:32.710 --> 03:10:32.720 align:start position:0%
I would urge you at very least to just
 
03:10:34.910 --> 03:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
wait and see how it works I think it's
 
03:10:37.349 --> 03:10:37.359 align:start position:0%
going to work everywhere every bit as
 
03:10:40.870 --> 03:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
well as the board of land and tax
 
03:10:43.990 --> 03:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
appeals on which it's based um but why
 
03:10:46.190 --> 03:10:46.200 align:start position:0%
don't let's wait and see and the proof
 
03:10:48.309 --> 03:10:48.319 align:start position:0%
of the pudding they say is in the pie or
 
03:10:51.630 --> 03:10:51.640 align:start position:0%
whatever they say um so I just urge you
 
03:10:54.830 --> 03:10:54.840 align:start position:0%
to uh vote itl on this
 
03:10:57.110 --> 03:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you are there any
 
03:11:01.190 --> 03:11:01.200 align:start position:0%
questions for attorney
 
03:11:05.030 --> 03:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
Barry singan thank you again for your
 
03:11:11.750 --> 03:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:11.760 --> 03:11:15.229 align:start position:0%
 
Ju

03:11:15.229 --> 03:11:15.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:17.190 --> 03:11:17.200 align:start position:0%
yes Mr chair members of the committee
 
03:11:20.229 --> 03:11:20.239 align:start position:0%
can you hear me okay can hear you fine
 
03:11:22.030 --> 03:11:22.040 align:start position:0%
thank you uh for the record my name is
 
03:11:24.429 --> 03:11:24.439 align:start position:0%
Dave juv I'm a senior vice president
 
03:11:26.110 --> 03:11:26.120 align:start position:0%
with the business and industry
 
03:11:28.349 --> 03:11:28.359 align:start position:0%
Association we're here in strong
 
03:11:31.590 --> 03:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill establishing the
 
03:11:33.670 --> 03:11:33.680 align:start position:0%
uh housing appeals board was a top
 
03:11:35.190 --> 03:11:35.200 align:start position:0%
priority for the
 
03:11:41.190 --> 03:11:41.200 align:start position:0%
Bia um and we remain we remain um in
 
03:11:43.750 --> 03:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
favor of that board with
 
03:11:46.190 --> 03:11:46.200 align:start position:0%
uh attorney Barry just noted has barely
 
03:11:48.429 --> 03:11:48.439 align:start position:0%
been up and running a month we think
 
03:11:50.190 --> 03:11:50.200 align:start position:0%
that it will actually save the state
 
03:11:52.790 --> 03:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
money not cost the state money by
 
03:11:54.670 --> 03:11:54.680 align:start position:0%
providing a more expeditious and
 
03:11:57.349 --> 03:11:57.359 align:start position:0%
inexpensive way to resolve a dispute
 
03:12:01.349 --> 03:12:01.359 align:start position:0%
between uh housing developers and uh
 
03:12:03.349 --> 03:12:03.359 align:start position:0%
municipalities uh the reality is
 
03:12:06.870 --> 03:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
employers around the state are um having
 
03:12:09.229 --> 03:12:09.239 align:start position:0%
a great deal of difficulty attracting
 
03:12:11.389 --> 03:12:11.399 align:start position:0%
employees with the limited amount of
 
03:12:13.910 --> 03:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
housing stock available for those
 
03:12:17.790 --> 03:12:17.800 align:start position:0%
employees uh we um are fully supportive
 
03:12:20.150 --> 03:12:20.160 align:start position:0%
of the housing appeals board we do think
 
03:12:22.309 --> 03:12:22.319 align:start position:0%
it will work to help increase Workforce
 
03:12:24.150 --> 03:12:24.160 align:start position:0%
housing throughout the state and we
 
03:12:27.030 --> 03:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
would urge you to reject this uh Bill
 
03:12:29.550 --> 03:12:29.560 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to address any questions
 
03:12:31.830 --> 03:12:31.840 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any qu yes attorney
 
03:12:36.150 --> 03:12:36.160 align:start position:0%
MC uh representative MC Beth thank you
 
03:12:39.429 --> 03:12:39.439 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and um thank you Mr D for
 
03:12:42.110 --> 03:12:42.120 align:start position:0%
taking my question just from the past
 
03:12:45.469 --> 03:12:45.479 align:start position:0%
two uh Witnesses we've heard that um you
 
03:12:46.750 --> 03:12:46.760 align:start position:0%
know it's
 
03:12:49.830 --> 03:12:49.840 align:start position:0%
consumers um W testimony that consumers
 
03:12:51.990 --> 03:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
would not benefit you're saying that um
 
03:12:54.389 --> 03:12:54.399 align:start position:0%
you know employers would not benefit who
 
03:12:58.309 --> 03:12:58.319 align:start position:0%
is going to benefit if this bill is
 
03:13:00.950 --> 03:13:00.960 align:start position:0%
repealed I mean Frank Frankly
 
03:13:02.670 --> 03:13:02.680 align:start position:0%
representative I don't think anyone
 
03:13:04.269 --> 03:13:04.279 align:start position:0%
benefits I don't think the
 
03:13:07.150 --> 03:13:07.160 align:start position:0%
municipalities benefit because just if
 
03:13:09.110 --> 03:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
you repeal this board that doesn't mean
 
03:13:10.870 --> 03:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
these disputes are going to go away it
 
03:13:13.389 --> 03:13:13.399 align:start position:0%
means they're going to have to uh be
 
03:13:15.950 --> 03:13:15.960 align:start position:0%
decided upon in court which is expensive
 
03:13:18.190 --> 03:13:18.200 align:start position:0%
both for the developer and for the
 
03:13:20.389 --> 03:13:20.399 align:start position:0%
municipality not to mention the fact
 
03:13:23.229 --> 03:13:23.239 align:start position:0%
that the one of the greatest advantages
 
03:13:25.670 --> 03:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
of this um housing appeals board was
 
03:13:28.670 --> 03:13:28.680 align:start position:0%
that it can act expeditiously on these
 
03:13:30.990 --> 03:13:31.000 align:start position:0%
on these disputes and resolve them and
 
03:13:32.830 --> 03:13:32.840 align:start position:0%
not have it dragged on for months and
 
03:13:37.229 --> 03:13:37.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:39.429 --> 03:13:39.439 align:start position:0%
system thank you for answering that
 
03:13:41.790 --> 03:13:41.800 align:start position:0%
question and thank you Mr chairman any
 
03:13:44.110 --> 03:13:44.120 align:start position:0%
other questions for Mr
 
03:13:46.830 --> 03:13:46.840 align:start position:0%
juet singan thank you for your testimony
 
03:13:49.950 --> 03:13:49.960 align:start position:0%
today thank you Mr chair again I'm going
 
03:13:51.590 --> 03:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
just going to add that everybody who
 
03:13:53.510 --> 03:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
signed up to testify is signed up in
 
03:13:56.229 --> 03:13:56.239 align:start position:0%
opposition so hopefully if they testify
 
03:13:58.710 --> 03:13:58.720 align:start position:0%
they can be succinct and just add new
 
03:14:01.590 --> 03:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
information that might be helpful to us
 
03:14:11.469 --> 03:14:11.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:11.479 --> 03:14:13.269 align:start position:0%
 
Michael

03:14:13.269 --> 03:14:13.279 align:start position:0%
Michael
 
03:14:16.269 --> 03:14:16.279 align:start position:0%
can you hear me now we can hear you
 
03:14:17.910 --> 03:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
thank you good morning Mr chairman and
 
03:14:19.910 --> 03:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
members my name is Gregory Michael I
 
03:14:21.349 --> 03:14:21.359 align:start position:0%
happen to be the chair of the housing
 
03:14:24.309 --> 03:14:24.319 align:start position:0%
appeals board I was placed on the board
 
03:14:26.110 --> 03:14:26.120 align:start position:0%
by the Supreme Court and confirmed by
 
03:14:27.710 --> 03:14:27.720 align:start position:0%
the governor along with Elizabeth
 
03:14:29.590 --> 03:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
Fischer and was still waiting our third
 
03:14:31.469 --> 03:14:31.479 align:start position:0%
member but in the internet room we're
 
03:14:34.309 --> 03:14:34.319 align:start position:0%
able to uh have uh surveyors and
 
03:14:36.429 --> 03:14:36.439 align:start position:0%
Engineers who are selected and approve
 
03:14:39.269 --> 03:14:39.279 align:start position:0%
by the Supreme Court to sit on an as
 
03:14:42.070 --> 03:14:42.080 align:start position:0%
needed basis uh we've only been we've
 
03:14:44.910 --> 03:14:44.920 align:start position:0%
only started in mid January we have two
 
03:14:46.910 --> 03:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
cases filed and I will tell you that our
 
03:14:49.870 --> 03:14:49.880 align:start position:0%
first trial is April 7th I think any of
 
03:14:51.269 --> 03:14:51.279 align:start position:0%
you who are familiar with the court
 
03:14:53.429 --> 03:14:53.439 align:start position:0%
system would recognize that that's quote
 
03:14:55.630 --> 03:14:55.640 align:start position:0%
moving the ball down the court faing
 
03:14:58.229 --> 03:14:58.239 align:start position:0%
rapidly our purpose is to do what you've
 
03:15:00.790 --> 03:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
heard and that is to expeditiously
 
03:15:03.030 --> 03:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
fairly and responsibly handle these
 
03:15:05.510 --> 03:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
cases I've submitted a letter to the
 
03:15:08.110 --> 03:15:08.120 align:start position:0%
board I would encourage the members to
 
03:15:09.670 --> 03:15:09.680 align:start position:0%
read it I should say the committee to
 
03:15:12.110 --> 03:15:12.120 align:start position:0%
read it I think it outlines some of the
 
03:15:15.950 --> 03:15:15.960 align:start position:0%
thought that we have in analyzing RSA
 
03:15:20.030 --> 03:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
679 the bottom line is as noted we
 
03:15:22.670 --> 03:15:22.680 align:start position:0%
believe that it's important to keep the
 
03:15:25.269 --> 03:15:25.279 align:start position:0%
keep the the projects moving in the
 
03:15:27.550 --> 03:15:27.560 align:start position:0%
sense that if it's denied at the local
 
03:15:30.110 --> 03:15:30.120 align:start position:0%
level we can take a look at it quickly
 
03:15:31.710 --> 03:15:31.720 align:start position:0%
and make decisions that are fair and
 
03:15:34.590 --> 03:15:34.600 align:start position:0%
appropriate and I would point out based
 
03:15:37.710 --> 03:15:37.720 align:start position:0%
upon the local regulations and
 
03:15:39.950 --> 03:15:39.960 align:start position:0%
ordinances I want to make it crystal
 
03:15:41.469 --> 03:15:41.479 align:start position:0%
clear that I've heard rumors that
 
03:15:44.309 --> 03:15:44.319 align:start position:0%
somehow we're some regulatory change
 
03:15:46.630 --> 03:15:46.640 align:start position:0%
agent we are not we operate like the
 
03:15:49.349 --> 03:15:49.359 align:start position:0%
Superior Court only more quickly and
 
03:15:51.590 --> 03:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
with board members that have significant
 
03:15:53.950 --> 03:15:53.960 align:start position:0%
expertise I've been involved in land use
 
03:15:56.550 --> 03:15:56.560 align:start position:0%
and planning for over 40
 
03:15:59.830 --> 03:15:59.840 align:start position:0%
years I've experienced every aspect of
 
03:16:02.750 --> 03:16:02.760 align:start position:0%
it our real estate person Beth fiser has
 
03:16:04.870 --> 03:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
been involved in real estate matters for
 
03:16:07.710 --> 03:16:07.720 align:start position:0%
over 40 years and any of the surveyors
 
03:16:10.189 --> 03:16:10.199 align:start position:0%
and Engineers that we select and use are
 
03:16:12.590 --> 03:16:12.600 align:start position:0%
also experienced people the list of
 
03:16:14.269 --> 03:16:14.279 align:start position:0%
names that I've submitted to the Supreme
 
03:16:17.110 --> 03:16:17.120 align:start position:0%
Court to consider on a temporary basis
 
03:16:20.309 --> 03:16:20.319 align:start position:0%
I've known them all for more than 30
 
03:16:23.150 --> 03:16:23.160 align:start position:0%
years these are people I would like to
 
03:16:25.750 --> 03:16:25.760 align:start position:0%
suggest will have the ability to quickly
 
03:16:28.710 --> 03:16:28.720 align:start position:0%
promptly and fairly res review these
 
03:16:31.229 --> 03:16:31.239 align:start position:0%
matters and I would point out that this
 
03:16:34.349 --> 03:16:34.359 align:start position:0%
goes both ways I mean the municipalities
 
03:16:35.870 --> 03:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
when they approve a project and it's
 
03:16:38.030 --> 03:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
appealed by a Butters it's important
 
03:16:41.349 --> 03:16:41.359 align:start position:0%
that it get resolved likewise if the
 
03:16:43.229 --> 03:16:43.239 align:start position:0%
town or city did denies a project and
 
03:16:45.030 --> 03:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
there's an issue with it we're going to
 
03:16:47.150 --> 03:16:47.160 align:start position:0%
take a close look and if there's a
 
03:16:49.189 --> 03:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
problem we can get the project back on
 
03:16:52.030 --> 03:16:52.040 align:start position:0%
track and this is really the the the
 
03:16:54.750 --> 03:16:54.760 align:start position:0%
fundamental difference between us and
 
03:16:56.830 --> 03:16:56.840 align:start position:0%
the Superior Court we're trying to do it
 
03:16:59.950 --> 03:16:59.960 align:start position:0%
quickly with expertise and as pointed
 
03:17:02.389 --> 03:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
out at at a much less expense than
 
03:17:05.389 --> 03:17:05.399 align:start position:0%
chasing your tail in Superior Court for
 
03:17:07.189 --> 03:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
potentially a year or more dealing with
 
03:17:07.199 --> 03:17:07.950 align:start position:0%
potentially a year or more dealing with
these

03:17:07.950 --> 03:17:07.960 align:start position:0%
these
 
03:17:10.990 --> 03:17:11.000 align:start position:0%
cases that's the summary of my my uh
 
03:17:12.670 --> 03:17:12.680 align:start position:0%
remarks I don't want to take up more
 
03:17:15.189 --> 03:17:15.199 align:start position:0%
time I know your time is limited today I
 
03:17:17.189 --> 03:17:17.199 align:start position:0%
appreciate you hearing me out if you
 
03:17:19.510 --> 03:17:19.520 align:start position:0%

03:17:21.720 --> 03:17:23.189 align:start position:0%
them representative MC Beth did you have
a

03:17:23.189 --> 03:17:23.199 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:17:23.199 --> 03:17:25.349 align:start position:0%
a
question

03:17:25.349 --> 03:17:25.359 align:start position:0%
question

thank you Mr shair and thank you for
 
03:17:37.550 --> 03:17:37.560 align:start position:0%
taking my question Mr Michael um
 
03:17:41.189 --> 03:17:41.199 align:start position:0%
opponents of this legislation um say
 
03:17:44.229 --> 03:17:44.239 align:start position:0%
that the housing appeals board takes
 
03:17:46.710 --> 03:17:46.720 align:start position:0%
away local control what would you say to
 
03:17:48.910 --> 03:17:48.920 align:start position:0%
that I would say that's absolutely a
 
03:17:50.950 --> 03:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
false statement we do not take away
 
03:17:54.110 --> 03:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
local control we are a different appeal
 
03:17:56.309 --> 03:17:56.319 align:start position:0%
place to go you either come to us or the
 
03:17:58.630 --> 03:17:58.640 align:start position:0%
superior court and I'll point out and I
 
03:18:00.590 --> 03:18:00.600 align:start position:0%
agree with I believe Senator babbit that
 
03:18:02.870 --> 03:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
testified there's no right to bounce
 
03:18:05.429 --> 03:18:05.439 align:start position:0%
back and forth you make an election to
 
03:18:07.790 --> 03:18:07.800 align:start position:0%
come before us or make an election to go
 
03:18:11.229 --> 03:18:11.239 align:start position:0%
before the superior court and we do not
 
03:18:14.189 --> 03:18:14.199 align:start position:0%
change local laws we do not change local
 
03:18:17.110 --> 03:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
ordinances we operate under the
 
03:18:19.630 --> 03:18:19.640 align:start position:0%
legislative scheme in each town and
 
03:18:22.269 --> 03:18:22.279 align:start position:0%
municipality which is done now our
 
03:18:24.309 --> 03:18:24.319 align:start position:0%
review is the certified record of what
 
03:18:26.710 --> 03:18:26.720 align:start position:0%
the town the local Town board
 
03:18:28.870 --> 03:18:28.880 align:start position:0%
experienced we don't take additional
 
03:18:31.030 --> 03:18:31.040 align:start position:0%
evidence unless it's critically
 
03:18:33.349 --> 03:18:33.359 align:start position:0%
important we operate on the certified
 
03:18:36.750 --> 03:18:36.760 align:start position:0%
record and we do not change modify or
 
03:18:39.349 --> 03:18:39.359 align:start position:0%
add to local zoning or planning
 
03:18:41.469 --> 03:18:41.479 align:start position:0%
regulations those are left to the local
 
03:18:44.349 --> 03:18:44.359 align:start position:0%
municipality ities as provided by State
 
03:18:46.070 --> 03:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
Statute thank
 
03:18:49.469 --> 03:18:49.479 align:start position:0%
you any other questions Miss Michael
 
03:18:53.790 --> 03:18:53.800 align:start position:0%
yeah yes represent mlan um thank you
 
03:18:56.429 --> 03:18:56.439 align:start position:0%
just just a quick question um the the
 
03:18:59.150 --> 03:18:59.160 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of the bill said that the
 
03:19:01.670 --> 03:19:01.680 align:start position:0%
case could be moved from one ven venue
 
03:19:04.030 --> 03:19:04.040 align:start position:0%
to another against a petitioner's will
 
03:19:06.950 --> 03:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
but who gets to choose the original
 
03:19:10.269 --> 03:19:10.279 align:start position:0%
venue do both parties have to agree to
 
03:19:13.269 --> 03:19:13.279 align:start position:0%
the original venue or how is that
 
03:19:15.510 --> 03:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
arrived at it's arrived that the
 
03:19:17.710 --> 03:19:17.720 align:start position:0%
petitioner the person who's bringing the
 
03:19:20.550 --> 03:19:20.560 align:start position:0%
appeal selects The Forum no different
 
03:19:22.510 --> 03:19:22.520 align:start position:0%
than now if you have a case that could
 
03:19:24.269 --> 03:19:24.279 align:start position:0%
be heard by the Circuit Court it can be
 
03:19:26.630 --> 03:19:26.640 align:start position:0%
in the circuit court that same case
 
03:19:28.630 --> 03:19:28.640 align:start position:0%
depending on the jurisdictional limits
 
03:19:30.750 --> 03:19:30.760 align:start position:0%
might be heard in Superior Court so it's
 
03:19:33.469 --> 03:19:33.479 align:start position:0%
the the petitioner the person appealing
 
03:19:36.110 --> 03:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
selects the the location I would point
 
03:19:38.309 --> 03:19:38.319 align:start position:0%
out that either party could make a
 
03:19:40.670 --> 03:19:40.680 align:start position:0%
motion before us I suppose or before the
 
03:19:43.189 --> 03:19:43.199 align:start position:0%
Superior Court to move it back and forth
 
03:19:44.830 --> 03:19:44.840 align:start position:0%
that's going to require the consent of
 
03:19:47.630 --> 03:19:47.640 align:start position:0%
both parties uh before that happens so
 
03:19:49.269 --> 03:19:49.279 align:start position:0%
to answer your question it's the
 
03:19:53.550 --> 03:19:53.560 align:start position:0%
petitioner that selects the trial
 
03:19:56.429 --> 03:19:56.439 align:start position:0%
location representative Alexander um
 
03:19:59.550 --> 03:19:59.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um in your opinion um
 
03:20:03.229 --> 03:20:03.239 align:start position:0%
Mr Michael is uh is is a is a ruling by
 
03:20:04.990 --> 03:20:05.000 align:start position:0%
the housing appeals board have the same
 
03:20:08.349 --> 03:20:08.359 align:start position:0%
kind of precedent or um case law
 
03:20:10.630 --> 03:20:10.640 align:start position:0%
established well I I would point out
 
03:20:12.269 --> 03:20:12.279 align:start position:0%
that the housing appeals board and
 
03:20:15.710 --> 03:20:15.720 align:start position:0%
Superior Court are not considered courts
 
03:20:18.189 --> 03:20:18.199 align:start position:0%
of record for judicial opinions that's
 
03:20:20.950 --> 03:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
the state supreme court our orders have
 
03:20:23.189 --> 03:20:23.199 align:start position:0%
the equivalent force and power of a
 
03:20:25.550 --> 03:20:25.560 align:start position:0%
superior court order I would like to
 
03:20:27.469 --> 03:20:27.479 align:start position:0%
make that clear we have the powers of a
 
03:20:30.590 --> 03:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
superior court judge to rule and handle
 
03:20:33.630 --> 03:20:33.640 align:start position:0%
these cases so our orders are equivalent
 
03:20:36.550 --> 03:20:36.560 align:start position:0%
to superior court orders and to the
 
03:20:38.189 --> 03:20:38.199 align:start position:0%
extent that people would like to review
 
03:20:40.830 --> 03:20:40.840 align:start position:0%
our orders they certainly can but each
 
03:20:43.670 --> 03:20:43.680 align:start position:0%
case would be decided on its own merits
 
03:20:46.229 --> 03:20:46.239 align:start position:0%
based upon the facts and the law of each
 
03:20:47.910 --> 03:20:47.920 align:start position:0%
municipality and that's the same
 
03:20:49.950 --> 03:20:49.960 align:start position:0%
standard used by Superior
 
03:20:51.910 --> 03:20:51.920 align:start position:0%
Court there any
 
03:20:56.590 --> 03:20:56.600 align:start position:0%
other any other questions for attorney
 
03:20:59.189 --> 03:20:59.199 align:start position:0%
Michael see thank you for your testimony
 
03:21:10.830 --> 03:21:10.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:10.840 --> 03:21:17.269 align:start position:0%
 
Frost

03:21:17.269 --> 03:21:17.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:19.150 --> 03:21:19.160 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman thank you and
 
03:21:20.710 --> 03:21:20.720 align:start position:0%
good afternoon committee members my name
 
03:21:22.670 --> 03:21:22.680 align:start position:0%
is Ben Frost I'm the managing director
 
03:21:24.389 --> 03:21:24.399 align:start position:0%
for policy and public affairs for the
 
03:21:26.750 --> 03:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Housing Finance Authority
 
03:21:29.670 --> 03:21:29.680 align:start position:0%
and I'm uh before you this afternoon to
 
03:21:30.870 --> 03:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
express New Hampshire housing's
 
03:21:32.950 --> 03:21:32.960 align:start position:0%
opposition to House Bill 288 and I'll
 
03:21:35.110 --> 03:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
direct you to uh the letter that we
 
03:21:37.030 --> 03:21:37.040 align:start position:0%
submitted from our executive director
 
03:21:40.469 --> 03:21:40.479 align:start position:0%
Dean Kristen um which and I'm not going
 
03:21:42.110 --> 03:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
to go into the details of that you're
 
03:21:44.189 --> 03:21:44.199 align:start position:0%
free to read that on your own um and
 
03:21:45.870 --> 03:21:45.880 align:start position:0%
most of what I wanted to say has already
 
03:21:47.550 --> 03:21:47.560 align:start position:0%
been said so I won't repeat it so I'll
 
03:21:51.269 --> 03:21:51.279 align:start position:0%
be even briefer than I intended um but I
 
03:21:53.469 --> 03:21:53.479 align:start position:0%
I do want to point out that uh the
 
03:21:56.150 --> 03:21:56.160 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board uh was based on
 
03:21:58.229 --> 03:21:58.239 align:start position:0%
the structure and longstanding
 
03:22:00.150 --> 03:22:00.160 align:start position:0%
performance of the New Hampshire Board
 
03:22:02.189 --> 03:22:02.199 align:start position:0%
of tax and land appeals which has since
 
03:22:05.309 --> 03:22:05.319 align:start position:0%
1973 admirably served the state of New
 
03:22:08.189 --> 03:22:08.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and its citizens um the
 
03:22:10.630 --> 03:22:10.640 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board is not a political
 
03:22:12.550 --> 03:22:12.560 align:start position:0%
body uh given that its members are
 
03:22:14.189 --> 03:22:14.199 align:start position:0%
appointed by the Supreme Court and it's
 
03:22:16.150 --> 03:22:16.160 align:start position:0%
not subject to political influence which
 
03:22:20.269 --> 03:22:20.279 align:start position:0%
I think is a a good design measure um
 
03:22:22.870 --> 03:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
and emphasizing what chair Michael just
 
03:22:25.950 --> 03:22:25.960 align:start position:0%
said about the issues of fairness uh the
 
03:22:27.510 --> 03:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board was really
 
03:22:30.910 --> 03:22:30.920 align:start position:0%
designed uh to be fair to all parties
 
03:22:34.510 --> 03:22:34.520 align:start position:0%
involved uh as as a housing Advocate I
 
03:22:36.349 --> 03:22:36.359 align:start position:0%
probably would have preferred a housing
 
03:22:38.790 --> 03:22:38.800 align:start position:0%
appeals board to which only developers
 
03:22:40.990 --> 03:22:41.000 align:start position:0%
could appeal but that would not have
 
03:22:42.870 --> 03:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
been Fair and I think the legislature
 
03:22:45.790 --> 03:22:45.800 align:start position:0%
recognized that and adopted legislation
 
03:22:48.469 --> 03:22:48.479 align:start position:0%
that created a board that established a
 
03:22:51.630 --> 03:22:51.640 align:start position:0%
board that is fair to
 
03:22:54.630 --> 03:22:54.640 align:start position:0%
developers to Property Owners to
 
03:22:57.150 --> 03:22:57.160 align:start position:0%
abutters anyone else who can demonstrate
 
03:23:01.429 --> 03:23:01.439 align:start position:0%
standing in an appeal and yes to
 
03:23:03.790 --> 03:23:03.800 align:start position:0%
municipalities for the foregoing reasons
 
03:23:05.349 --> 03:23:05.359 align:start position:0%
and for reasons that others have stated
 
03:23:06.790 --> 03:23:06.800 align:start position:0%
as well as the letter from New Hampshire
 
03:23:08.990 --> 03:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
housing we respectfully request you to
 
03:23:11.469 --> 03:23:11.479 align:start position:0%
itl House Bill 288 and I'd be happy to
 
03:23:13.950 --> 03:23:13.960 align:start position:0%
take any questions thank you for your
 
03:23:17.229 --> 03:23:17.239 align:start position:0%
testimony are there any questions for Mr
 
03:23:21.150 --> 03:23:21.160 align:start position:0%
Frost seeing none again thank you next
 
03:23:25.710 --> 03:23:25.720 align:start position:0%

03:23:38.189 --> 03:23:38.199 align:start position:0%
Realtors and I come before you today to
 
03:23:41.110 --> 03:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
request you to itl this bill like others
 
03:23:44.389 --> 03:23:44.399 align:start position:0%
have before for and I will be brief uh
 
03:23:47.469 --> 03:23:47.479 align:start position:0%
just limiting to some new text as you
 
03:23:51.189 --> 03:23:51.199 align:start position:0%
had requested Mr chair statistically uh
 
03:23:55.550 --> 03:23:55.560 align:start position:0%
rents in the last five years are up 22%
 
03:23:57.070 --> 03:23:57.080 align:start position:0%
according to the New Hampshire Housing
 
03:24:00.030 --> 03:24:00.040 align:start position:0%
Finance Authority and according to our
 
03:24:02.990 --> 03:24:03.000 align:start position:0%
statistics as the Realtors uh the median
 
03:24:06.349 --> 03:24:06.359 align:start position:0%
price of a single family home is up
 
03:24:10.990 --> 03:24:11.000 align:start position:0%
37% in those same five years uh the
 
03:24:13.070 --> 03:24:13.080 align:start position:0%
balance of the data I just want to give
 
03:24:16.830 --> 03:24:16.840 align:start position:0%
uh there was a question as far as um the
 
03:24:19.910 --> 03:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
the costs in raising this is going to
 
03:24:23.389 --> 03:24:23.399 align:start position:0%
raise uh fees for the state we believe
 
03:24:25.630 --> 03:24:25.640 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a less expensive path
 
03:24:29.070 --> 03:24:29.080 align:start position:0%
forward for both cities and towns and
 
03:24:32.469 --> 03:24:32.479 align:start position:0%
also Agri AG grieved parties which is
 
03:24:34.750 --> 03:24:34.760 align:start position:0%
really the last thing I'll say echoing
 
03:24:37.429 --> 03:24:37.439 align:start position:0%
what Ben just mentioned is that we are
 
03:24:40.510 --> 03:24:40.520 align:start position:0%
for property owners um yes we would like
 
03:24:42.670 --> 03:24:42.680 align:start position:0%
to see more housing that's that is an
 
03:24:45.469 --> 03:24:45.479 align:start position:0%
important challenge that our state is
 
03:24:49.229 --> 03:24:49.239 align:start position:0%
facing together but we can't do it on
 
03:24:52.269 --> 03:24:52.279 align:start position:0%
the backs of abutting property owners
 
03:24:55.870 --> 03:24:55.880 align:start position:0%
and if you are an AG grieved abutter um
 
03:24:58.269 --> 03:24:58.279 align:start position:0%
you you could have standing um I'm not
 
03:25:00.030 --> 03:25:00.040 align:start position:0%
going to get into the details of who has
 
03:25:02.950 --> 03:25:02.960 align:start position:0%
standing in and appeals but we feel that
 
03:25:07.510 --> 03:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
this is a good path of remedy for all
 
03:25:10.630 --> 03:25:10.640 align:start position:0%
parties who may have concerns uh be it a
 
03:25:13.630 --> 03:25:13.640 align:start position:0%
developer or another party of standing
 
03:25:16.910 --> 03:25:16.920 align:start position:0%
who wishes to challenge that development
 
03:25:18.870 --> 03:25:18.880 align:start position:0%
uh so with that I will entertain any
 
03:25:21.150 --> 03:25:21.160 align:start position:0%
questions and thank you for your time
 
03:25:23.750 --> 03:25:23.760 align:start position:0%

chairman um housing action New Hampshire
 
03:26:08.030 --> 03:26:08.040 align:start position:0%
was one of several stakeholders who have
 
03:26:09.870 --> 03:26:09.880 align:start position:0%
been working on this proposal for
 
03:26:12.870 --> 03:26:12.880 align:start position:0%
several years uh for our members our
 
03:26:15.990 --> 03:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
members include those who um develop
 
03:26:18.150 --> 03:26:18.160 align:start position:0%
finance and manage affordable housing
 
03:26:20.790 --> 03:26:20.800 align:start position:0%
around the state of New Hampshire um
 
03:26:24.550 --> 03:26:24.560 align:start position:0%
we're expressing concerns about um delay
 
03:26:26.750 --> 03:26:26.760 align:start position:0%
tactics that were driving up the cost of
 
03:26:29.630 --> 03:26:29.640 align:start position:0%
providing housing as Mission oriented
 
03:26:32.389 --> 03:26:32.399 align:start position:0%
developers who want to pass on a more
 
03:26:35.670 --> 03:26:35.680 align:start position:0%
affordable property uh to those uh
 
03:26:38.429 --> 03:26:38.439 align:start position:0%
seeking a home that they can afford um
 
03:26:40.750 --> 03:26:40.760 align:start position:0%
adding uh the delays and costs
 
03:26:42.710 --> 03:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
associated with the traditional uh
 
03:26:45.670 --> 03:26:45.680 align:start position:0%
revieww process um is not an option for
 
03:26:48.750 --> 03:26:48.760 align:start position:0%
our developers as they cannot pass along
 
03:26:53.269 --> 03:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
those additional costs uh to their um to
 
03:26:56.309 --> 03:26:56.319 align:start position:0%
their consumers um so there was this
 
03:26:58.830 --> 03:26:58.840 align:start position:0%
absence of Justice uh in in fact they
 
03:27:02.269 --> 03:27:02.279 align:start position:0%
just in many cases did not appeal I'd
 
03:27:03.830 --> 03:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
also like to make the point that the
 
03:27:06.070 --> 03:27:06.080 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board does not uh in any
 
03:27:09.790 --> 03:27:09.800 align:start position:0%
way mean that um that those reviews will
 
03:27:13.750 --> 03:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
uh be in favor of of the developer um as
 
03:27:16.670 --> 03:27:16.680 align:start position:0%
we have seen in the uh longstanding
 
03:27:19.229 --> 03:27:19.239 align:start position:0%
Bureau of tax and land appeals it is
 
03:27:22.269 --> 03:27:22.279 align:start position:0%
simply a more efficient uh and more
 
03:27:25.830 --> 03:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
effective uh appeal mechanism um so that
 
03:27:29.429 --> 03:27:29.439 align:start position:0%
our Judiciary can uh prioritize uh their
 
03:27:32.110 --> 03:27:32.120 align:start position:0%
case load um and with that I'll conclude
 
03:27:32.120 --> 03:27:33.349 align:start position:0%
case load um and with that I'll conclude
my

03:27:33.349 --> 03:27:33.359 align:start position:0%
my
 
03:27:36.269 --> 03:27:36.279 align:start position:0%

you members of the committee um I'll be
 
03:28:02.790 --> 03:28:02.800 align:start position:0%
very brief because I know the committee
 
03:28:04.910 --> 03:28:04.920 align:start position:0%
is running behind and uh uh much of what
 
03:28:07.070 --> 03:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
I said in my testimonies has been said
 
03:28:08.630 --> 03:28:08.640 align:start position:0%
and I submitted some written testimony
 
03:28:10.910 --> 03:28:10.920 align:start position:0%
as well so um all I'll say is uh my
 
03:28:13.309 --> 03:28:13.319 align:start position:0%
name's Marino um I work for an
 
03:28:15.550 --> 03:28:15.560 align:start position:0%
organization called 603 forward we are
 
03:28:18.349 --> 03:28:18.359 align:start position:0%
um a youth advocacy organization um and
 
03:28:19.710 --> 03:28:19.720 align:start position:0%
one of our priorities is to promote
 
03:28:21.150 --> 03:28:21.160 align:start position:0%
affordable housing in New Hampshire to
 
03:28:22.590 --> 03:28:22.600 align:start position:0%
help attract and retain more young
 
03:28:25.389 --> 03:28:25.399 align:start position:0%
people to our states um repealing the
 
03:28:27.550 --> 03:28:27.560 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board um would be very
 
03:28:29.750 --> 03:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
detrimental to the goal of um promoting
 
03:28:31.189 --> 03:28:31.199 align:start position:0%
affordable housing and attracting more
 
03:28:33.229 --> 03:28:33.239 align:start position:0%
young people to our state um we believe
 
03:28:34.630 --> 03:28:34.640 align:start position:0%
that the housing appeals board has been
 
03:28:38.349 --> 03:28:38.359 align:start position:0%
a reasonable reform um that um helps
 
03:28:41.429 --> 03:28:41.439 align:start position:0%
expedite the the process for appeals um
 
03:28:42.950 --> 03:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
and um helps pave the way for more
 
03:28:44.910 --> 03:28:44.920 align:start position:0%
affordable housing so we strongly urge
 
03:28:48.070 --> 03:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
you to um uh support an itl
 
03:28:50.910 --> 03:28:50.920 align:start position:0%
recommendation for HB 288 um and I'm
 
03:28:52.309 --> 03:28:52.319 align:start position:0%
very grateful for your time today thank
 
03:28:54.750 --> 03:28:54.760 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you for your brief
 
03:28:58.590 --> 03:28:58.600 align:start position:0%
testimony any questions from Mr Marino
 
03:29:09.670 --> 03:29:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:12.150 --> 03:29:12.160 align:start position:0%
saens good afternoon Mr chair and thank
 
03:29:14.389 --> 03:29:14.399 align:start position:0%
you my name is Jason sorens of Amherst
 
03:29:16.590 --> 03:29:16.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and I am also director of
 
03:29:20.389 --> 03:29:20.399 align:start position:0%
the center for ethics at St anom college
 
03:29:22.670 --> 03:29:22.680 align:start position:0%
and our Center and I myself do a lot of
 
03:29:26.229 --> 03:29:26.239 align:start position:0%
housing policy research and um I'll
 
03:29:28.590 --> 03:29:28.600 align:start position:0%
stick to uh a couple of original points
 
03:29:30.189 --> 03:29:30.199 align:start position:0%
that previous speakers have not
 
03:29:34.110 --> 03:29:34.120 align:start position:0%
addressed um one is that um ecomist have
 
03:29:37.590 --> 03:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
found that uh local regulatory barriers
 
03:29:40.710 --> 03:29:40.720 align:start position:0%
to building new homes is really the main
 
03:29:42.990 --> 03:29:43.000 align:start position:0%
reason in why New Hampshire is facing a
 
03:29:43.000 --> 03:29:43.950 align:start position:0%
reason in why New Hampshire is facing a
critical

03:29:43.950 --> 03:29:43.960 align:start position:0%
critical
 
03:29:46.670 --> 03:29:46.680 align:start position:0%
undersupply of Housing and those
 
03:29:49.550 --> 03:29:49.560 align:start position:0%
regulatory barriers are not just those
 
03:29:52.389 --> 03:29:52.399 align:start position:0%
codified uh in black and white on paper
 
03:29:54.870 --> 03:29:54.880 align:start position:0%
in fact uh to a substantial degree they
 
03:29:56.469 --> 03:29:56.479 align:start position:0%
they consist of the the discretionary
 
03:29:58.550 --> 03:29:58.560 align:start position:0%
decisions of local land use boards it's
 
03:30:00.670 --> 03:30:00.680 align:start position:0%
not unknown for a local land use board
 
03:30:05.349 --> 03:30:05.359 align:start position:0%
to uh take um an illegal decision to
 
03:30:08.189 --> 03:30:08.199 align:start position:0%
block um a potential development perhaps
 
03:30:11.110 --> 03:30:11.120 align:start position:0%
because of the the fears of of a Butters
 
03:30:13.309 --> 03:30:13.319 align:start position:0%
or simply they don't like the project
 
03:30:15.910 --> 03:30:15.920 align:start position:0%
and uh the developers the property
 
03:30:18.790 --> 03:30:18.800 align:start position:0%
owners who are most deterred by
 
03:30:21.750 --> 03:30:21.760 align:start position:0%
challenging uh those sorts of decisions
 
03:30:24.870 --> 03:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
are the small landowners um big
 
03:30:27.590 --> 03:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
developers may have legal departments or
 
03:30:30.990 --> 03:30:31.000 align:start position:0%
lawyers on retainer who can um take
 
03:30:33.630 --> 03:30:33.640 align:start position:0%
these these cases to court um but very
 
03:30:35.469 --> 03:30:35.479 align:start position:0%
often a smaller landowner think of a
 
03:30:37.990 --> 03:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
farmer subdividing his his property into
 
03:30:41.510 --> 03:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
a handful of single family home sites um
 
03:30:44.590 --> 03:30:44.600 align:start position:0%
may may simply look at this um barrier
 
03:30:46.550 --> 03:30:46.560 align:start position:0%
and say no no thanks I'm not going to
 
03:30:49.550 --> 03:30:49.560 align:start position:0%
take the cost and the delay of pursuing
 
03:30:51.070 --> 03:30:51.080 align:start position:0%
this fight in the
 
03:30:53.189 --> 03:30:53.199 align:start position:0%
courts and the other point I would make
 
03:30:55.070 --> 03:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
is that the housing appeals board is
 
03:30:57.910 --> 03:30:57.920 align:start position:0%
actually um fairly Innovative it's it
 
03:31:00.710 --> 03:31:00.720 align:start position:0%
fits a model of appeals boards that we
 
03:31:02.309 --> 03:31:02.319 align:start position:0%
have here in New Hampshire but other
 
03:31:04.030 --> 03:31:04.040 align:start position:0%
states are also looking at the our
 
03:31:07.110 --> 03:31:07.120 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board uh specifically I
 
03:31:08.990 --> 03:31:09.000 align:start position:0%
was invited recently to participate in a
 
03:31:11.269 --> 03:31:11.279 align:start position:0%
panel um by the Manhattan Institute
 
03:31:13.150 --> 03:31:13.160 align:start position:0%
which is the free market think tank in
 
03:31:16.309 --> 03:31:16.319 align:start position:0%
New York um on a paper that is on New

adopt to help make it so that we at

barriers that are preventing new housing
 
03:31:31.830 --> 03:31:31.840 align:start position:0%
are the ones that are actually written
 
03:31:33.710 --> 03:31:33.720 align:start position:0%
down on paper um so this doesn't
 
03:31:35.630 --> 03:31:35.640 align:start position:0%
actually repeal any regulations but it
 
03:31:37.910 --> 03:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
simply makes it so that um those
 
03:31:39.950 --> 03:31:39.960 align:start position:0%
regulatory barriers that do exist are
 
03:31:42.349 --> 03:31:42.359 align:start position:0%

go hello this is uh Robert turny and I'm
 
03:34:13.150 --> 03:34:13.160 align:start position:0%
the executive director at neighbor workk
 
03:34:14.189 --> 03:34:14.199 align:start position:0%
Southern New
 
03:34:18.830 --> 03:34:18.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I think one of the
 
03:34:23.750 --> 03:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
unmentioned uh um folks that that will
 
03:34:25.309 --> 03:34:25.319 align:start position:0%
be impacted by this and hopefully
 
03:34:28.550 --> 03:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
benefit from this um our homeowners I I
 
03:34:30.510 --> 03:34:30.520 align:start position:0%
we're an affordable housing developer
 
03:34:33.990 --> 03:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
but the when the bill was introduced um
 
03:34:36.590 --> 03:34:36.600 align:start position:0%
it's the sponsor mentioned that it was
 
03:34:38.389 --> 03:34:38.399 align:start position:0%
going to benefit developers and I think
 
03:34:40.429 --> 03:34:40.439 align:start position:0%
it's important to mention and recognize
 
03:34:40.439 --> 03:34:41.269 align:start position:0%
it's important to mention and recognize
that

03:34:41.269 --> 03:34:41.279 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:34:43.150 --> 03:34:43.160 align:start position:0%
um single family homeowners in
 
03:34:45.590 --> 03:34:45.600 align:start position:0%
municipalities of to encounter some many
 
03:34:47.309 --> 03:34:47.319 align:start position:0%
of the same challenges that developers
 
03:34:49.309 --> 03:34:49.319 align:start position:0%
do and they certainly don't have the
 
03:34:52.269 --> 03:34:52.279 align:start position:0%
wherewithal to pursue uh a challenge
 
03:34:54.070 --> 03:34:54.080 align:start position:0%
through the court system and i' just
 
03:34:55.710 --> 03:34:55.720 align:start position:0%
like to give one example as an
 
03:34:57.950 --> 03:34:57.960 align:start position:0%
affordable housing developer of an
 
03:35:00.070 --> 03:35:00.080 align:start position:0%
example where I had a planning board
 
03:35:01.990 --> 03:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
chair look me straight in the eye and
 
03:35:03.710 --> 03:35:03.720 align:start position:0%
say there's no conditions in our
 
03:35:05.469 --> 03:35:05.479 align:start position:0%
planning ordinance in our ordinance that
 
03:35:07.429 --> 03:35:07.439 align:start position:0%
will require us to put these conditions
 
03:35:09.349 --> 03:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
on the approval of your project but
 
03:35:11.870 --> 03:35:11.880 align:start position:0%
nonetheless since it was brought during
 
03:35:13.469 --> 03:35:13.479 align:start position:0%
the approval process we're going to make
 
03:35:16.030 --> 03:35:16.040 align:start position:0%
you adhere to them and I have to then
 
03:35:17.950 --> 03:35:17.960 align:start position:0%
take the take that recommendation and
 
03:35:20.389 --> 03:35:20.399 align:start position:0%
that decision and decide do I want to
 
03:35:22.150 --> 03:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
move forward with my approvals and spend
 
03:35:24.389 --> 03:35:24.399 align:start position:0%
the extra $100,000 on our project that
 
03:35:27.150 --> 03:35:27.160 align:start position:0%
this is going to cost us or do I want to
 
03:35:29.469 --> 03:35:29.479 align:start position:0%
not accept it and go through the lengthy
 
03:35:32.150 --> 03:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
judicial lengthy and expensive judicial
 
03:35:34.710 --> 03:35:34.720 align:start position:0%
process um and I had no choice I felt
 
03:35:36.630 --> 03:35:36.640 align:start position:0%
like I had no choice because I could not
 
03:35:38.590 --> 03:35:38.600 align:start position:0%
afford the time delay that would be
 
03:35:40.590 --> 03:35:40.600 align:start position:0%
associated with a legal Challenge and so
 
03:35:42.070 --> 03:35:42.080 align:start position:0%
so we agreed to accept the conditions
 
03:35:43.950 --> 03:35:43.960 align:start position:0%
and pay the $100,000 in additional
 
03:35:45.910 --> 03:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
construction costs that that put on our
 
03:35:48.389 --> 03:35:48.399 align:start position:0%
project had something like the land use
 
03:35:50.189 --> 03:35:50.199 align:start position:0%
appeals board been in place at that
 
03:35:51.910 --> 03:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
point in time I probably would have been
 
03:35:53.790 --> 03:35:53.800 align:start position:0%
able to come forth with a different a
 
03:35:56.309 --> 03:35:56.319 align:start position:0%
different uh decision and affect my
 
03:35:58.550 --> 03:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
project differently and had not had been
 
03:36:01.189 --> 03:36:01.199 align:start position:0%
so expensive so I really want the
 
03:36:02.590 --> 03:36:02.600 align:start position:0%
committee members to take that into
 
03:36:05.349 --> 03:36:05.359 align:start position:0%

03:38:39.469 --> 03:38:39.479 align:start position:0%
good idea I just want to speak for a
 
03:38:41.070 --> 03:38:41.080 align:start position:0%
minute about about the need to do
 
03:38:42.710 --> 03:38:42.720 align:start position:0%
everything we can to make housing more
 
03:38:44.429 --> 03:38:44.439 align:start position:0%
affordable for young people and everyone
 
03:38:46.150 --> 03:38:46.160 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire and not to make
 
03:38:48.349 --> 03:38:48.359 align:start position:0%
the housing affordability situation even
 
03:38:50.750 --> 03:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
worse so attracting and retaining more
 
03:38:52.469 --> 03:38:52.479 align:start position:0%
young people is critical to the future
 
03:38:54.389 --> 03:38:54.399 align:start position:0%
of our state you know New Hampshire as
 
03:38:55.670 --> 03:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
you may know is the second oldest state
 
03:38:56.790 --> 03:38:56.800 align:start position:0%
in the country with one of the lowest
 
03:38:58.830 --> 03:38:58.840 align:start position:0%
unemployment rates on top of this we're
 
03:39:00.389 --> 03:39:00.399 align:start position:0%
the number one exporter of high school
 
03:39:02.469 --> 03:39:02.479 align:start position:0%
graduates seeking a four-year degree
 
03:39:04.429 --> 03:39:04.439 align:start position:0%
with some 62% of these young people
 
03:39:06.429 --> 03:39:06.439 align:start position:0%
leaving the state every year some of
 
03:39:08.790 --> 03:39:08.800 align:start position:0%
them come back but a lot of them don't
 
03:39:10.510 --> 03:39:10.520 align:start position:0%
in short New Hampshire needs all the
 
03:39:12.070 --> 03:39:12.080 align:start position:0%
people we can get in general and all the
 
03:39:14.030 --> 03:39:14.040 align:start position:0%
young people we can get in particular
 
03:39:15.510 --> 03:39:15.520 align:start position:0%
and our businesses you know they need
 
03:39:17.630 --> 03:39:17.640 align:start position:0%
workers and customers as we've heard our
 
03:39:19.510 --> 03:39:19.520 align:start position:0%
towns need volunteered board members our
 
03:39:21.590 --> 03:39:21.600 align:start position:0%
nonprofits our churches our Civic clubs
 
03:39:23.189 --> 03:39:23.199 align:start position:0%
all need volunteers to accomplish their
 
03:39:24.870 --> 03:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
vital missions without which our
 
03:39:26.950 --> 03:39:26.960 align:start position:0%
communities and our state just can't
 
03:39:29.229 --> 03:39:29.239 align:start position:0%
function about three years ago stay work
 
03:39:30.870 --> 03:39:30.880 align:start position:0%
play commissioned a survey to collect
 
03:39:32.710 --> 03:39:32.720 align:start position:0%
data on why young people stay in and
 
03:39:34.429 --> 03:39:34.439 align:start position:0%
might leave New Hampshire and the number
 
03:39:35.750 --> 03:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
one reason we found that young people
 
03:39:37.469 --> 03:39:37.479 align:start position:0%
might leave is that they just can't
 
03:39:39.630 --> 03:39:39.640 align:start position:0%
afford to live here our housing both on
 
03:39:40.990 --> 03:39:41.000 align:start position:0%
the rental side side and on the home
 
03:39:43.429 --> 03:39:43.439 align:start position:0%
ownership side is just too expensive and
 
03:39:44.990 --> 03:39:45.000 align:start position:0%
we heard this over and over again last
 
03:39:47.229 --> 03:39:47.239 align:start position:0%
winter uh as we talked to young people
 
03:39:49.070 --> 03:39:49.080 align:start position:0%
in nine locations across the state as
 
03:39:51.510 --> 03:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
part of our policy and pint Series so
 
03:39:52.790 --> 03:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
you know housing here in New Hampshire
 
03:39:54.990 --> 03:39:55.000 align:start position:0%
is expensive for just about everyone but
 
03:39:56.990 --> 03:39:57.000 align:start position:0%
it's especially exp expensive for young
 
03:39:59.150 --> 03:39:59.160 align:start position:0%
people who by being in their early in
 
03:40:00.790 --> 03:40:00.800 align:start position:0%
their careers generally make less money
 
03:40:02.630 --> 03:40:02.640 align:start position:0%
than their more experienced counterparts
 
03:40:03.790 --> 03:40:03.800 align:start position:0%
and young people also face the
 
03:40:05.469 --> 03:40:05.479 align:start position:0%
additional burden of student loan debt
 
03:40:06.590 --> 03:40:06.600 align:start position:0%
indeed New Hampshire has one of the
 
03:40:07.990 --> 03:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
highest average student debt loads in
 
03:40:09.950 --> 03:40:09.960 align:start position:0%
the country and so you when you're
 
03:40:11.269 --> 03:40:11.279 align:start position:0%
paying hundreds of dollars a month in
 
03:40:12.990 --> 03:40:13.000 align:start position:0%
student loan payments every month it
 
03:40:15.150 --> 03:40:15.160 align:start position:0%
makes it that much harder to afford
 
03:40:17.750 --> 03:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
housing that's already expensive so you
 
03:40:19.790 --> 03:40:19.800 align:start position:0%
know for these reasons we ask you to
 
03:40:22.349 --> 03:40:22.359 align:start position:0%
oppose House Bill 288 and to retain the
 
03:40:24.429 --> 03:40:24.439 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board which will help to
 
03:40:26.469 --> 03:40:26.479 align:start position:0%
make housing less expensive here in New
 
03:40:28.790 --> 03:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you thank you are there
 
03:40:28.800 --> 03:40:31.309 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you thank you are there
any

03:40:31.309 --> 03:40:31.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:33.670 --> 03:40:33.680 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
03:40:35.630 --> 03:40:35.640 align:start position:0%
testimony is there anyone else who
 
03:40:37.309 --> 03:40:37.319 align:start position:0%
wishes to
 
03:40:40.830 --> 03:40:40.840 align:start position:0%
testify seeing no hands
 
03:40:44.429 --> 03:40:44.439 align:start position:0%
we will close the hearing on House Bill
 
03:40:44.439 --> 03:40:46.550 align:start position:0%
we will close the hearing on House Bill
288

03:40:46.550 --> 03:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
288
 
03:40:48.990 --> 03:40:49.000 align:start position:0%
FN which brings us to the end of our
 
03:40:49.000 --> 03:40:51.389 align:start position:0%
FN which brings us to the end of our
morning

03:40:51.389 --> 03:40:51.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:56.030 --> 03:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
doc yeah uh I guess the question and Jen
 
03:40:59.030 --> 03:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
if you're on the line is it possible to
 
03:41:01.670 --> 03:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
put up a message that indicates that we
 
03:41:06.710 --> 03:41:06.720 align:start position:0%
would reconvene for our hearing on 478
 
03:41:06.720 --> 03:41:08.469 align:start position:0%
would reconvene for our hearing on 478
at

03:41:08.469 --> 03:41:08.479 align:start position:0%
at
 
03:41:12.670 --> 03:41:12.680 align:start position:0%
1:5 yeah we can do that okay then I
 
03:41:14.429 --> 03:41:14.439 align:start position:0%
think that that's a good idea give
 
03:41:16.150 --> 03:41:16.160 align:start position:0%
people enough time to take a little bit
 
03:41:18.950 --> 03:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
of break anyway so if you would mind
 
03:41:21.990 --> 03:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
putting that message up and uh we will
 
03:41:27.309 --> 03:41:27.319 align:start position:0%
recess our today's hearing until
 
03:41:39.030 --> 03:41:39.040 align:start position:0%

to continue to

pollute this unfortunate scenario then
 
04:26:05.590 --> 04:26:05.600 align:start position:0%

precedent we cannot
 
04:26:30.670 --> 04:26:30.680 align:start position:0%
set I would respectfully ask that the

Mooney for taking my question and it's
 
04:27:00.910 --> 04:27:00.920 align:start position:0%
it's kind of the
 
04:27:06.030 --> 04:27:06.040 align:start position:0%
overarching um question about contracts
 
04:27:08.109 --> 04:27:08.119 align:start position:0%
and enforcement of settlement agreements
 
04:27:13.469 --> 04:27:13.479 align:start position:0%
and the like and as I understand it um
 
04:27:14.830 --> 04:27:14.840 align:start position:0%
there's been
 
04:27:17.309 --> 04:27:17.319 align:start position:0%
pollution in in that
 
04:27:22.149 --> 04:27:22.159 align:start position:0%
area um it was believed that s Goan caus
 
04:27:25.830 --> 04:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
the pollution Z Coan says no you know we
 
04:27:27.750 --> 04:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
didn't do it all the pollution or some
 
04:27:29.750 --> 04:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
of the pollution or whatever percentage
 
04:27:32.710 --> 04:27:32.720 align:start position:0%
may be and eventually a settlement
 
04:27:34.109 --> 04:27:34.119 align:start position:0%
agreement was
 
04:27:38.030 --> 04:27:38.040 align:start position:0%
reached um both sides got something out
 
04:27:41.149 --> 04:27:41.159 align:start position:0%
of this settlement agreement the uh
 
04:27:45.349 --> 04:27:45.359 align:start position:0%
marabac got uh to avoid the litigation
 
04:27:48.590 --> 04:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
about who's liable for the damage could
 
04:27:51.790 --> 04:27:51.800 align:start position:0%
go right into the solutions save years
 
04:27:57.109 --> 04:27:57.119 align:start position:0%
of uh of litigation costs and time Etc
 
04:28:03.790 --> 04:28:03.800 align:start position:0%
and um the uh St Coan got a
 
04:28:07.229 --> 04:28:07.239 align:start position:0%
defined uh obligation out of the
 
04:28:11.670 --> 04:28:11.680 align:start position:0%
situation am I correct in understanding
 
04:28:16.950 --> 04:28:16.960 align:start position:0%
that um what you would like done is
 
04:28:19.149 --> 04:28:19.159 align:start position:0%
ripping up that
 
04:28:23.389 --> 04:28:23.399 align:start position:0%
agreement but keeping the
 
04:28:27.590 --> 04:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
admission uh so to speak by St Goan of
 
04:28:27.600 --> 04:28:28.670 align:start position:0%
admission uh so to speak by St Goan of
their

04:28:28.670 --> 04:28:28.680 align:start position:0%
their
 
04:28:31.990 --> 04:28:32.000 align:start position:0%
liability and just saying you guys are
 
04:28:33.670 --> 04:28:33.680 align:start position:0%
liable and you're just going to have to
 
04:28:37.670 --> 04:28:37.680 align:start position:0%
pay everything or do you EV Vision uh
 
04:28:39.870 --> 04:28:39.880 align:start position:0%
going back to what the situation was
 
04:28:42.710 --> 04:28:42.720 align:start position:0%
before the agreement which was to
 
04:28:47.030 --> 04:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:49.950 --> 04:28:49.960 align:start position:0%
issues thank you for the question I
 
04:28:53.630 --> 04:28:53.640 align:start position:0%
would answer that by saying we'd like to
 
04:28:57.229 --> 04:28:57.239 align:start position:0%
see the agreement extended beyond that
 
04:28:57.239 --> 04:28:58.910 align:start position:0%
see the agreement extended beyond that
2025

04:28:58.910 --> 04:28:58.920 align:start position:0%
2025
 
04:29:03.070 --> 04:29:03.080 align:start position:0%
date and that is again that all costs
 
04:29:05.469 --> 04:29:05.479 align:start position:0%
associated with the operation monitoring
 
04:29:08.510 --> 04:29:08.520 align:start position:0%
and maintenance and additional
 
04:29:12.030 --> 04:29:12.040 align:start position:0%
modifications be covered by St
 
04:29:14.349 --> 04:29:14.359 align:start position:0%
gobain uh since the time of that
 
04:29:14.359 --> 04:29:16.149 align:start position:0%
gobain uh since the time of that
agreement

04:29:16.149 --> 04:29:16.159 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
04:29:19.630 --> 04:29:19.640 align:start position:0%
too the standards of July 2020 have gone
 
04:29:22.950 --> 04:29:22.960 align:start position:0%
into effect there's certainly a chance
 
04:29:25.710 --> 04:29:25.720 align:start position:0%
before 2025 that the standards will
 
04:29:25.720 --> 04:29:26.910 align:start position:0%
before 2025 that the standards will
change

04:29:26.910 --> 04:29:26.920 align:start position:0%
change
 
04:29:30.229 --> 04:29:30.239 align:start position:0%
again and I go back to my conclusion in
 
04:29:33.429 --> 04:29:33.439 align:start position:0%
that uh the customers of the marac
 
04:29:36.149 --> 04:29:36.159 align:start position:0%
Village Water District cannot not be
 
04:29:38.910 --> 04:29:38.920 align:start position:0%
placed in a position to pay for a
 
04:29:42.070 --> 04:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
private industry's
 
04:29:46.510 --> 04:29:46.520 align:start position:0%
pollution thank you if I could follow up
 
04:29:49.990 --> 04:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
may if you get what you
 
04:29:54.030 --> 04:29:54.040 align:start position:0%
want which is to change the terms of the
 
04:29:56.550 --> 04:29:56.560 align:start position:0%
settlement doesn't St
 
04:30:01.830 --> 04:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
Goan have a right to go back and say no
 
04:30:03.550 --> 04:30:03.560 align:start position:0%
settlement we're going to litigate
 
04:30:06.790 --> 04:30:06.800 align:start position:0%
whether we're uh liable for this damage
 
04:30:08.630 --> 04:30:08.640 align:start position:0%
and what percentage of the damage we're
 
04:30:08.640 --> 04:30:12.830 align:start position:0%
and what percentage of the damage we're
liable

04:30:12.830 --> 04:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:17.269 --> 04:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
for I would say they would consider
 
04:30:20.910 --> 04:30:20.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:25.630 --> 04:30:25.640 align:start position:0%
and if I that's acceptable to you to
 
04:30:27.550 --> 04:30:27.560 align:start position:0%
start the process
 
04:30:30.870 --> 04:30:30.880 align:start position:0%
over well uh certainly I would like it
 
04:30:34.189 --> 04:30:34.199 align:start position:0%
if they didn't but uh so far marac has
 
04:30:36.189 --> 04:30:36.199 align:start position:0%
had difficulty controlling any actions
 
04:30:39.229 --> 04:30:39.239 align:start position:0%
of Sy Oban so I can't focus too much on
 
04:30:42.030 --> 04:30:42.040 align:start position:0%
what they will or will not do uh my
 
04:30:44.429 --> 04:30:44.439 align:start position:0%
focus is making sure that the taxpayers
 
04:30:47.590 --> 04:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
of miramac don't bear costs of Private
 
04:30:47.600 --> 04:30:49.750 align:start position:0%
of miramac don't bear costs of Private
Industry

04:30:49.750 --> 04:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
Industry
 
04:30:52.950 --> 04:30:52.960 align:start position:0%
pollution thank you representative mlan
 
04:30:54.429 --> 04:30:54.439 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
04:30:56.149 --> 04:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
taking my question just to kind of
 
04:30:57.590 --> 04:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
follow up a little bit on where
 
04:31:00.349 --> 04:31:00.359 align:start position:0%
representative Burch was going since
 
04:31:02.710 --> 04:31:02.720 align:start position:0%
there was this settlement and there was
 
04:31:06.670 --> 04:31:06.680 align:start position:0%
an agreement um if if new information
 
04:31:07.790 --> 04:31:07.800 align:start position:0%
has come
 
04:31:12.269 --> 04:31:12.279 align:start position:0%
forward why why would you not pursue um
 
04:31:15.429 --> 04:31:15.439 align:start position:0%
uh further redress in the courts what
 
04:31:18.510 --> 04:31:18.520 align:start position:0%
what is making you pursue a legislative
 
04:31:21.670 --> 04:31:21.680 align:start position:0%
solution um as opposed to uh going back
 
04:31:23.950 --> 04:31:23.960 align:start position:0%
to the courts
 
04:31:26.229 --> 04:31:26.239 align:start position:0%
again thank you that's a good and very
 
04:31:26.239 --> 04:31:27.630 align:start position:0%
again thank you that's a good and very
reasonable

04:31:27.630 --> 04:31:27.640 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
04:31:30.830 --> 04:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
question um a few
 
04:31:34.429 --> 04:31:34.439 align:start position:0%
things recent headlines have once again
 
04:31:36.790 --> 04:31:36.800 align:start position:0%
highlighted the difficult ulty the town
 
04:31:41.510 --> 04:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
of miramac has had uh with negotiations
 
04:31:44.070 --> 04:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
with st gobain it's
 
04:31:47.269 --> 04:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
unfortunate however uh those in the
 
04:31:48.990 --> 04:31:49.000 align:start position:0%
citizens for clean
 
04:31:53.429 --> 04:31:53.439 align:start position:0%
water former speaker Hench and myself
 
04:31:55.189 --> 04:31:55.199 align:start position:0%
and others who worked so diligently on
 
04:31:57.229 --> 04:31:57.239 align:start position:0%
this bill including the co-sponsors felt
 
04:32:02.269 --> 04:32:02.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:04.469 --> 04:32:04.479 align:start position:0%
Avenue representative
 
04:32:04.479 --> 04:32:07.109 align:start position:0%
Avenue representative
Paige

04:32:07.109 --> 04:32:07.119 align:start position:0%
Paige
 
04:32:09.870 --> 04:32:09.880 align:start position:0%
yes I I think um rep thank you for
 
04:32:12.149 --> 04:32:12.159 align:start position:0%
taking my question Mr and allowing me
 
04:32:14.429 --> 04:32:14.439 align:start position:0%
the opportunity Mr chair I think uh
 
04:32:16.349 --> 04:32:16.359 align:start position:0%
representative mlan may have touched on
 
04:32:18.030 --> 04:32:18.040 align:start position:0%
part of my question but I'm wondering if
 
04:32:19.670 --> 04:32:19.680 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney could elaborate
 
04:32:23.510 --> 04:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
just a little bit more anything uh has
 
04:32:25.389 --> 04:32:25.399 align:start position:0%
the extent to which things have changed
 
04:32:28.950 --> 04:32:28.960 align:start position:0%
since um the town entered in the
 
04:32:31.429 --> 04:32:31.439 align:start position:0%
settlement agreement on March 28th
 
04:32:35.429 --> 04:32:35.439 align:start position:0%
2018 to now in terms of things that were
 
04:32:39.269 --> 04:32:39.279 align:start position:0%
perhaps uncovered that would
 
04:32:41.630 --> 04:32:41.640 align:start position:0%
um more damage
 
04:32:44.349 --> 04:32:44.359 align:start position:0%
more um things that weren't known at
 
04:32:45.429 --> 04:32:45.439 align:start position:0%
that time when you entered the
 
04:32:46.630 --> 04:32:46.640 align:start position:0%
settlement agreement or could not have
 
04:32:49.950 --> 04:32:49.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:52.630 --> 04:32:52.640 align:start position:0%
time thank you for that that's a very
 
04:32:55.630 --> 04:32:55.640 align:start position:0%
good question as well and um I would I
 
04:32:59.389 --> 04:32:59.399 align:start position:0%
would refer you to that section RSA 485
 
04:33:03.670 --> 04:33:03.680 align:start position:0%
colon 16 hyphen e uh it's cited in my
 
04:33:07.029 --> 04:33:07.039 align:start position:0%
testimony under the standard section
 
04:33:10.070 --> 04:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
uh there will be individuals testifying
 
04:33:12.310 --> 04:33:12.320 align:start position:0%
after me who worked on that as those
 
04:33:15.349 --> 04:33:15.359 align:start position:0%
went into effect those standards maximum
 
04:33:17.470 --> 04:33:17.480 align:start position:0%
contaminant levels those standards went
 
04:33:20.670 --> 04:33:20.680 align:start position:0%
into effect July 23d
 
04:33:22.949 --> 04:33:22.959 align:start position:0%
2020 and so they could certainly get
 
04:33:25.349 --> 04:33:25.359 align:start position:0%
into the details of
 
04:33:27.830 --> 04:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
that um I believe another part of your
 
04:33:30.709 --> 04:33:30.719 align:start position:0%
question was with regards to those who
 
04:33:32.869 --> 04:33:32.879 align:start position:0%
who made the
 
04:33:35.709 --> 04:33:35.719 align:start position:0%
agreement and the commissioners of The
 
04:33:40.551 --> 04:33:40.561 align:start position:0%
marac Village Water District are
 
04:33:43.629 --> 04:33:43.639 align:start position:0%
elected and so those that um entered the
 
04:33:47.869 --> 04:33:47.879 align:start position:0%
agreement are not there at this time
 
04:33:51.470 --> 04:33:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:53.590 --> 04:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
Commissioners are there any other
 
04:33:53.600 --> 04:33:55.510 align:start position:0%
Commissioners are there any other
questions

04:33:55.510 --> 04:33:55.520 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:33:55.520 --> 04:33:59.070 align:start position:0%
questions
for

04:33:59.070 --> 04:33:59.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:01.910 --> 04:34:01.920 align:start position:0%
represent if I if I could just inquire
 
04:34:04.590 --> 04:34:04.600 align:start position:0%
this is sort of a followup to the prior
 
04:34:08.189 --> 04:34:08.199 align:start position:0%
questions and and that is
 
04:34:13.269 --> 04:34:13.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:16.510 --> 04:34:16.520 align:start position:0%
agreement and I guess the question that
 
04:34:20.310 --> 04:34:20.320 align:start position:0%
I have is do you have any reason to
 
04:34:25.670 --> 04:34:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:28.470 --> 04:34:28.480 align:start position:0%
agreement thank you for
 
04:34:31.390 --> 04:34:31.400 align:start position:0%
that I think in light
 
04:34:34.269 --> 04:34:34.279 align:start position:0%
of what's come about since
 
04:34:34.279 --> 04:34:36.869 align:start position:0%
of what's come about since
2018

04:34:36.869 --> 04:34:36.879 align:start position:0%
2018
 
04:34:40.189 --> 04:34:40.199 align:start position:0%
in light of uh St gobain not being
 
04:34:43.029 --> 04:34:43.039 align:start position:0%
cooperative and not just water but now
 
04:34:45.670 --> 04:34:45.680 align:start position:0%
it's air filtrations and so
 
04:34:49.349 --> 04:34:49.359 align:start position:0%
forth I think it's justifiable to say
 
04:34:51.990 --> 04:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
that a bill of this nature would be an
 
04:34:55.429 --> 04:34:55.439 align:start position:0%
appropriate Avenue in this instance to
 
04:34:58.349 --> 04:34:58.359 align:start position:0%
look out for the best interest of the
 
04:35:03.789 --> 04:35:03.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:10.709 --> 04:35:10.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:12.590 --> 04:35:12.600 align:start position:0%
representative okay thank you very much
 
04:35:14.109 --> 04:35:14.119 align:start position:0%

04:36:24.470 --> 04:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
big advocate for businesses because
 
04:36:26.910 --> 04:36:26.920 align:start position:0%
businesses are the vehicle to produce
 
04:36:29.230 --> 04:36:29.240 align:start position:0%
jobs and make Prosperity possible for
 
04:36:31.990 --> 04:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
all New Hampshire citizens but while I
 
04:36:35.750 --> 04:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
advocate for businesses I do expect that
 
04:36:37.670 --> 04:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
those businesses will operate in a
 
04:36:40.230 --> 04:36:40.240 align:start position:0%
proper and responsible way including the
 
04:36:42.590 --> 04:36:42.600 align:start position:0%
treatment of their employees and taking
 
04:36:45.189 --> 04:36:45.199 align:start position:0%
the initiative to ensure that no harm is
 
04:36:46.670 --> 04:36:46.680 align:start position:0%
done to the environment in the
 
04:36:49.070 --> 04:36:49.080 align:start position:0%
production of the products they make or
 
04:36:52.189 --> 04:36:52.199 align:start position:0%
the services they offer I support this
 
04:36:54.510 --> 04:36:54.520 align:start position:0%
bill because my constituents in marac
 
04:36:57.189 --> 04:36:57.199 align:start position:0%
have suffered harm from contaminants
 
04:37:00.070 --> 04:37:00.080 align:start position:0%
created by s goban in the manufacturing
 
04:37:03.070 --> 04:37:03.080 align:start position:0%
of its products and secondly because the
 
04:37:05.750 --> 04:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
company has not fully mitigated nor in a
 
04:37:08.510 --> 04:37:08.520 align:start position:0%
timely manner responsibly address the
 
04:37:11.109 --> 04:37:11.119 align:start position:0%
pollution it has created and the harm it
 
04:37:13.869 --> 04:37:13.879 align:start position:0%
has done to the marac community because
 
04:37:16.629 --> 04:37:16.639 align:start position:0%
of the inaction by Sangle Bane including
 
04:37:21.590 --> 04:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
its rebuff of the marac Town Council in
 
04:37:23.230 --> 04:37:23.240 align:start position:0%
upholding its
 
04:37:25.510 --> 04:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
responsibilities uh I feel that it
 
04:37:27.551 --> 04:37:27.561 align:start position:0%
therefore becomes necessary for this
 
04:37:30.510 --> 04:37:30.520 align:start position:0%
legislature to hold sangoan accountable
 
04:37:33.150 --> 04:37:33.160 align:start position:0%
for rectification of the damage it has
 
04:37:36.429 --> 04:37:36.439 align:start position:0%
brought upon the mar M community and I
 
04:37:39.070 --> 04:37:39.080 align:start position:0%
don't do this lightly uh but I have seen
 
04:37:42.390 --> 04:37:42.400 align:start position:0%
the frustration uh as the Town Council
 
04:37:45.429 --> 04:37:45.439 align:start position:0%
Works to find resolution to this and I
 
04:37:47.830 --> 04:37:47.840 align:start position:0%
have seen the stalling that has gone on
 
04:37:53.070 --> 04:37:53.080 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the company uh in doing it
 
04:37:56.830 --> 04:37:56.840 align:start position:0%
the responsible thing and uh upholding
 
04:37:58.990 --> 04:37:59.000 align:start position:0%
its part its responsible part of the
 
04:38:02.029 --> 04:38:02.039 align:start position:0%
cleanup so I therefore uh respectfully
 
04:38:03.789 --> 04:38:03.799 align:start position:0%
ask that the committee vote ought to
 
04:38:05.429 --> 04:38:05.439 align:start position:0%
pass on House Bill
 
04:38:08.590 --> 04:38:08.600 align:start position:0%
478 thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
04:38:10.629 --> 04:38:10.639 align:start position:0%
your testimony so there any questions
 
04:38:13.269 --> 04:38:13.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:16.590 --> 04:38:16.600 align:start position:0%
senator see none thank you
 
04:38:19.470 --> 04:38:19.480 align:start position:0%
again there is another sponsor who
 
04:38:21.109 --> 04:38:21.119 align:start position:0%
signed up and that is represented
 
04:38:21.119 --> 04:38:31.029 align:start position:0%
signed up and that is represented
Rosemary

04:38:31.029 --> 04:38:31.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:34.070 --> 04:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
rum good afternoon can everyone hear me
 
04:38:35.510 --> 04:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
you can
 
04:38:37.869 --> 04:38:37.879 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much for the record
 
04:38:40.230 --> 04:38:40.240 align:start position:0%
my name is representative Rosemary rung
 
04:38:42.390 --> 04:38:42.400 align:start position:0%
and I represent marac which is in
 
04:38:46.150 --> 04:38:46.160 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro County 21 I come before you in
 
04:38:47.869 --> 04:38:47.879 align:start position:0%
support of HB
 
04:38:50.670 --> 04:38:50.680 align:start position:0%
478 and I bring many perspectives to
 
04:38:54.230 --> 04:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
this discussion first I am a 38y year
 
04:38:56.910 --> 04:38:56.920 align:start position:0%
resident of miramac and also a 38-year
 
04:38:58.990 --> 04:38:59.000 align:start position:0%
customer of the miramac Village Water
 
04:39:01.390 --> 04:39:01.400 align:start position:0%
District I've served on the resources
 
04:39:03.510 --> 04:39:03.520 align:start position:0%
committee which hears many water related
 
04:39:05.990 --> 04:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
and pasas related business Bill s and I
 
04:39:09.470 --> 04:39:09.480 align:start position:0%
currently chair the HB 737 commission to
 
04:39:11.310 --> 04:39:11.320 align:start position:0%
study the environmental and health
 
04:39:12.590 --> 04:39:12.600 align:start position:0%
impacts of
 
04:39:15.150 --> 04:39:15.160 align:start position:0%
pasas as you know from reading the bill
 
04:39:17.750 --> 04:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
SLE Bane performance plastic marac
 
04:39:20.390 --> 04:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
operation has caused pasas contamination
 
04:39:22.910 --> 04:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
of our groundwater groundwater which
 
04:39:25.949 --> 04:39:25.959 align:start position:0%
serves as the sole source of mvds water
 
04:39:29.269 --> 04:39:29.279 align:start position:0%
supply this contamination is the largest
 
04:39:31.510 --> 04:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
industrial contamination in the history
 
04:39:33.990 --> 04:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire impacting not only
 
04:39:37.350 --> 04:39:37.360 align:start position:0%
miramac but many surrounding communities
 
04:39:40.190 --> 04:39:40.200 align:start position:0%
the level of pasas contamination exceeds
 
04:39:43.270 --> 04:39:43.280 align:start position:0%
not only the EPA advisory limits but
 
04:39:44.990 --> 04:39:45.000 align:start position:0%
also the New Hampshire maximum
 
04:39:47.868 --> 04:39:47.878 align:start position:0%
contaminant levels when this
 
04:39:51.070 --> 04:39:51.080 align:start position:0%
contamination was first discovered in
 
04:39:54.270 --> 04:39:54.280 align:start position:0%
2016 MVD Commissioners scrambled to get
 
04:39:56.910 --> 04:39:56.920 align:start position:0%
a Filtration plant built and reached a
 
04:39:59.110 --> 04:39:59.120 align:start position:0%
short-term settlement with SLE bang to
 
04:40:02.708 --> 04:40:02.718 align:start position:0%
provide Financial Resources to do so we
 
04:40:05.070 --> 04:40:05.080 align:start position:0%
have since learned since that that
 
04:40:07.430 --> 04:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
settlement that the financial resources
 
04:40:10.110 --> 04:40:10.120 align:start position:0%
necessary far exceeds what was initially
 
04:40:13.110 --> 04:40:13.120 align:start position:0%
agreed upon studies conducted since the
 
04:40:15.110 --> 04:40:15.120 align:start position:0%
settlement particularly a Minnesota
 
04:40:18.310 --> 04:40:18.320 align:start position:0%
study on the effects of pasas on infants
 
04:40:21.750 --> 04:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
shows a causal relationship so serious
 
04:40:23.550 --> 04:40:23.560 align:start position:0%
that it led the New Hampshire Department
 
04:40:25.830 --> 04:40:25.840 align:start position:0%
of Environmental Services to recommend
 
04:40:28.310 --> 04:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
far stricter standards than what was
 
04:40:30.550 --> 04:40:30.560 align:start position:0%
initially proposed for the maximum
 
04:40:33.590 --> 04:40:33.600 align:start position:0%
contaminant levels so the responsibility
 
04:40:35.670 --> 04:40:35.680 align:start position:0%
of providing safety drinking water has
 
04:40:35.680 --> 04:40:36.868 align:start position:0%
of providing safety drinking water has
grown

04:40:36.868 --> 04:40:36.878 align:start position:0%
grown
 
04:40:39.310 --> 04:40:39.320 align:start position:0%
significantly thus the question before
 
04:40:41.670 --> 04:40:41.680 align:start position:0%
us is who holds this
 
04:40:44.550 --> 04:40:44.560 align:start position:0%
responsibility obviously SLE ban their
 
04:40:46.788 --> 04:40:46.798 align:start position:0%
chemicals leave their plant and enter
 
04:40:49.030 --> 04:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
our groundwater and they should bear the
 
04:40:52.430 --> 04:40:52.440 align:start position:0%
responsibility and cost of removing them
 
04:40:55.110 --> 04:40:55.120 align:start position:0%
but who should hold them to this
 
04:40:57.350 --> 04:40:57.360 align:start position:0%
responsibility I contend that it is the
 
04:41:00.070 --> 04:41:00.080 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire after all it is
 
04:41:03.110 --> 04:41:03.120 align:start position:0%
the state that has entered into statute
 
04:41:05.230 --> 04:41:05.240 align:start position:0%
maximum contaminant levels
 
04:41:07.550 --> 04:41:07.560 align:start position:0%
and that was just done a year or two
 
04:41:10.830 --> 04:41:10.840 align:start position:0%
ago and it is the state that regulates
 
04:41:12.830 --> 04:41:12.840 align:start position:0%
and enforces these standards on
 
04:41:15.750 --> 04:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
Municipal Water Systems the state should
 
04:41:18.110 --> 04:41:18.120 align:start position:0%
have the responsibility to hold Seno
 
04:41:20.350 --> 04:41:20.360 align:start position:0%
Bane responsible for removing their
 
04:41:22.788 --> 04:41:22.798 align:start position:0%
chemicals from our public drinking water
 
04:41:25.190 --> 04:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
for as long as those chemicals risk the
 
04:41:28.110 --> 04:41:28.120 align:start position:0%
health of our citizens and this is why I
 
04:41:30.350 --> 04:41:30.360 align:start position:0%
recommend to the Judiciary Committee and
 
04:41:33.150 --> 04:41:33.160 align:start position:0%
ought to pass motion on HB
 
04:41:35.590 --> 04:41:35.600 align:start position:0%
478 thank you and I would be happy to
 
04:41:36.670 --> 04:41:36.680 align:start position:0%
answer any
 
04:41:39.830 --> 04:41:39.840 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
04:41:42.590 --> 04:41:42.600 align:start position:0%
bur thank you Mr chairman and and thank
 
04:41:42.600 --> 04:41:43.430 align:start position:0%
bur thank you Mr chairman and and thank
you

04:41:43.430 --> 04:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:41:45.670 --> 04:41:45.680 align:start position:0%
representative um I want to go back to
 
04:41:48.910 --> 04:41:48.920 align:start position:0%
your statement where you ask and answer
 
04:41:51.430 --> 04:41:51.440 align:start position:0%
the question the question before us is
 
04:41:54.350 --> 04:41:54.360 align:start position:0%
who holds this responsibility obviously
 
04:41:54.360 --> 04:41:55.390 align:start position:0%
who holds this responsibility obviously
St

04:41:55.390 --> 04:41:55.400 align:start position:0%
St
 
04:41:59.868 --> 04:41:59.878 align:start position:0%
gobain um from a legal point of view
 
04:42:03.390 --> 04:42:03.400 align:start position:0%
that is based solely upon the
 
04:42:05.350 --> 04:42:05.360 align:start position:0%
agreement uh
 
04:42:10.030 --> 04:42:10.040 align:start position:0%
that now you suggest be ripped up uh are
 
04:42:14.070 --> 04:42:14.080 align:start position:0%
you also comfortable with stco Bane
 
04:42:16.708 --> 04:42:16.718 align:start position:0%
having the right to go back and litigate
 
04:42:21.150 --> 04:42:21.160 align:start position:0%
what uh level of liability they should
 
04:42:24.150 --> 04:42:24.160 align:start position:0%
have whether it's 100% 50%
 
04:42:28.830 --> 04:42:28.840 align:start position:0%
75% and secondly the amounts of money
 
04:42:32.310 --> 04:42:32.320 align:start position:0%
that St gobain has spent in detrimental
 
04:42:35.190 --> 04:42:35.200 align:start position:0%
Reliance on this agreement which is
 
04:42:38.150 --> 04:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
probably right now in the millions uh is
 
04:42:39.910 --> 04:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
that money going to be
 
04:42:44.708 --> 04:42:44.718 align:start position:0%
refunded uh at this point to uh s Goan
 
04:42:44.718 --> 04:42:45.990 align:start position:0%
refunded uh at this point to uh s Goan
by

04:42:45.990 --> 04:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
by
 
04:42:48.868 --> 04:42:48.878 align:start position:0%
marac well let me um kind of puts things
 
04:42:53.030 --> 04:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
in perspective about s Goan um in 2020
 
04:42:55.310 --> 04:42:55.320 align:start position:0%
they had a net income of
 
04:42:58.990 --> 04:42:59.000 align:start position:0%
$1.75 billion dollar so when we talk
 
04:43:01.390 --> 04:43:01.400 align:start position:0%
about any money they've spent in marac I
 
04:43:03.830 --> 04:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
think we have to put it in context to
 
04:43:06.150 --> 04:43:06.160 align:start position:0%
the overall income that the company
 
04:43:09.948 --> 04:43:09.958 align:start position:0%
provides um but I I look at this bill in
 
04:43:11.708 --> 04:43:11.718 align:start position:0%
a way kind of separate from the
 
04:43:13.990 --> 04:43:14.000 align:start position:0%
settlement the settlement is in place it
 
04:43:16.310 --> 04:43:16.320 align:start position:0%
was negotiated in good faith by both
 
04:43:19.510 --> 04:43:19.520 align:start position:0%
parties and it has an expiration date um
 
04:43:21.070 --> 04:43:21.080 align:start position:0%
but if I could use an analogy
 
04:43:22.948 --> 04:43:22.958 align:start position:0%
representative Birch to help you
 
04:43:25.150 --> 04:43:25.160 align:start position:0%
understand the situation imagine that
 
04:43:28.590 --> 04:43:28.600 align:start position:0%
you had a a nextdoor neighbor okay maybe
 
04:43:31.030 --> 04:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
it was a convenience store maybe it was
 
04:43:34.550 --> 04:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
uh um you know grocery store whatever
 
04:43:36.868 --> 04:43:36.878 align:start position:0%
and their trash continued to blow on
 
04:43:38.868 --> 04:43:38.878 align:start position:0%
your property and you reached an
 
04:43:41.110 --> 04:43:41.120 align:start position:0%
agreement with them that for five years
 
04:43:43.350 --> 04:43:43.360 align:start position:0%
they have to clean up and and and they
 
04:43:45.750 --> 04:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
have to absorb the expense of cleaning
 
04:43:46.708 --> 04:43:46.718 align:start position:0%
up that
 
04:43:50.310 --> 04:43:50.320 align:start position:0%
trash now the five years is over but
 
04:43:52.390 --> 04:43:52.400 align:start position:0%
unfortunately their trash is they have
 
04:43:55.150 --> 04:43:55.160 align:start position:0%
not remediated that and the trash is
 
04:43:57.350 --> 04:43:57.360 align:start position:0%
still blowing on your property who's
 
04:44:00.550 --> 04:44:00.560 align:start position:0%
responsible for enforcing that do you do
 
04:44:02.070 --> 04:44:02.080 align:start position:0%
you have to go back to court to have a
 
04:44:04.070 --> 04:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
settlement but shouldn't the town or the
 
04:44:07.150 --> 04:44:07.160 align:start position:0%
mun IP ality who has litter ordinances
 
04:44:09.310 --> 04:44:09.320 align:start position:0%
be the responsible party for cleaning up
 
04:44:11.430 --> 04:44:11.440 align:start position:0%
that litter for forcing your neighbor to
 
04:44:13.990 --> 04:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
clean up that litter why should you be
 
04:44:18.110 --> 04:44:18.120 align:start position:0%
the enforcer of of laws and ordinances
 
04:44:20.670 --> 04:44:20.680 align:start position:0%
that's the responsibility of government
 
04:44:22.270 --> 04:44:22.280 align:start position:0%
that is why I believe that it's very
 
04:44:24.590 --> 04:44:24.600 align:start position:0%
appropriate for the state and for the
 
04:44:29.510 --> 04:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
general court to um Force SLE ban to
 
04:44:31.750 --> 04:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
take responsibility for its
 
04:44:34.948 --> 04:44:34.958 align:start position:0%
contamination and the cost of it therein
 
04:44:37.868 --> 04:44:37.878 align:start position:0%
I hope I answered your
 
04:44:40.628 --> 04:44:40.638 align:start position:0%
question um I don't think you answered
 
04:44:43.670 --> 04:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
either part of the question that's okay
 
04:44:46.310 --> 04:44:46.320 align:start position:0%
I I get where you come from yeah this
 
04:44:48.948 --> 04:44:48.958 align:start position:0%
the settlement agreement is you know it
 
04:44:51.110 --> 04:44:51.120 align:start position:0%
it it's an agreement it's it's isolated
 
04:44:53.190 --> 04:44:53.200 align:start position:0%
it has a be begin date it has an end
 
04:44:55.310 --> 04:44:55.320 align:start position:0%
date there are costs that have been
 
04:44:58.830 --> 04:44:58.840 align:start position:0%
covered by Seno Bain but even with or
 
04:45:01.030 --> 04:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
without that settlement agreement SLE
 
04:45:03.310 --> 04:45:03.320 align:start position:0%
Bane is contaminating groundwater
 
04:45:06.310 --> 04:45:06.320 align:start position:0%
they're violating the state's maximum
 
04:45:09.628 --> 04:45:09.638 align:start position:0%
contaminant levels so who who should
 
04:45:14.310 --> 04:45:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:18.190 --> 04:45:18.200 align:start position:0%
comply thank you uh representative mcque
 
04:45:19.550 --> 04:45:19.560 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:45:22.590 --> 04:45:22.600 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so um with
 
04:45:25.990 --> 04:45:26.000 align:start position:0%
respect to uh the original settlement a
 
04:45:28.750 --> 04:45:28.760 align:start position:0%
lot of light information has come to
 
04:45:31.708 --> 04:45:31.718 align:start position:0%
light which would make you want to
 
04:45:34.230 --> 04:45:34.240 align:start position:0%
revisit that and I can complete
 
04:45:36.788 --> 04:45:36.798 align:start position:0%
completely understand that um I guess
 
04:45:39.190 --> 04:45:39.200 align:start position:0%
the concern I have is with the
 
04:45:42.230 --> 04:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
legislative solution I think what what
 
04:45:45.430 --> 04:45:45.440 align:start position:0%
this sort of does is maybe sets up a
 
04:45:48.750 --> 04:45:48.760 align:start position:0%
situation where everybody who is
 
04:45:50.990 --> 04:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
polluting in the future we we could
 
04:45:54.230 --> 04:45:54.240 align:start position:0%
maybe have 200 or 100 cases where we
 
04:45:56.470 --> 04:45:56.480 align:start position:0%
have to have this as opposed to allowing
 
04:46:01.430 --> 04:46:01.440 align:start position:0%
them uh to go through the courts um so
 
04:46:03.510 --> 04:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
what makes and I don't think he would be
 
04:46:05.868 --> 04:46:05.878 align:start position:0%
advocating that every case of a polluter
 
04:46:08.550 --> 04:46:08.560 align:start position:0%
would have to come to the legislature so
 
04:46:12.350 --> 04:46:12.360 align:start position:0%
what what makes this so special that in
 
04:46:15.830 --> 04:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
this particular case it has to fall
 
04:46:18.708 --> 04:46:18.718 align:start position:0%
outside of the courts and you have to
 
04:46:20.830 --> 04:46:20.840 align:start position:0%
pursue that legislative
 
04:46:22.990 --> 04:46:23.000 align:start position:0%
remedy uh well thank you very much for
 
04:46:25.628 --> 04:46:25.638 align:start position:0%
your question I think the big game Cher
 
04:46:28.430 --> 04:46:28.440 align:start position:0%
in my mind is the establishment by the
 
04:46:30.230 --> 04:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire of Maximum
 
04:46:32.548 --> 04:46:32.558 align:start position:0%
contaminant levels for Four Past
 
04:46:36.270 --> 04:46:36.280 align:start position:0%
chemicals um we now have that in statute
 
04:46:39.350 --> 04:46:39.360 align:start position:0%
um the these drinking water standards
 
04:46:43.350 --> 04:46:43.360 align:start position:0%
and um those are enforcable by Dees and
 
04:46:46.310 --> 04:46:46.320 align:start position:0%
so I look at it that Dees or the state
 
04:46:48.990 --> 04:46:49.000 align:start position:0%
should ensure the enforceability of
 
04:46:51.190 --> 04:46:51.200 align:start position:0%
those standards now those standards in
 
04:46:54.310 --> 04:46:54.320 align:start position:0%
miramac are being violated because of
 
04:46:57.390 --> 04:46:57.400 align:start position:0%
the direct contamination by SLE Bane so
 
04:46:59.350 --> 04:46:59.360 align:start position:0%
it's my opinion that the state should
 
04:47:04.270 --> 04:47:04.280 align:start position:0%
compel SLE Bane to um absorb the cost of
 
04:47:07.230 --> 04:47:07.240 align:start position:0%
removing those contaminants to the level
 
04:47:13.350 --> 04:47:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:15.830 --> 04:47:15.840 align:start position:0%
requirement you want to follow up just
 
04:47:18.670 --> 04:47:18.680 align:start position:0%
just just so if if as a result of the
 
04:47:20.350 --> 04:47:20.360 align:start position:0%
new standards and thank you for taking
 
04:47:22.708 --> 04:47:22.718 align:start position:0%
my followup question but if as a result
 
04:47:23.990 --> 04:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
of the new
 
04:47:27.110 --> 04:47:27.120 align:start position:0%
standards we find 10 additional
 
04:47:30.030 --> 04:47:30.040 align:start position:0%
polluters would all 10 of those
 
04:47:32.470 --> 04:47:32.480 align:start position:0%
polluters then have to be brought before
 
04:47:35.430 --> 04:47:35.440 align:start position:0%
the general court or should they have to
 
04:47:38.670 --> 04:47:38.680 align:start position:0%
go through the courts um what is your
 
04:47:42.350 --> 04:47:42.360 align:start position:0%
thought on that uh my thought is um I
 
04:47:46.548 --> 04:47:46.558 align:start position:0%
would like to see Dees enforce the these
 
04:47:49.470 --> 04:47:49.480 align:start position:0%
standards I mean it's unfortunate that
 
04:47:52.230 --> 04:47:52.240 align:start position:0%
um the mayor M Village District had to
 
04:47:54.390 --> 04:47:54.400 align:start position:0%
reach a had to to enter into a
 
04:47:56.070 --> 04:47:56.080 align:start position:0%
settlement agreement with senle ban in
 
04:47:59.310 --> 04:47:59.320 align:start position:0%
the first place it should be the state's
 
04:48:01.628 --> 04:48:01.638 align:start position:0%
responsibility um we have a department
 
04:48:03.390 --> 04:48:03.400 align:start position:0%
of environmental standards it should be
 
04:48:05.868 --> 04:48:05.878 align:start position:0%
their respons responsibility to compel
 
04:48:09.190 --> 04:48:09.200 align:start position:0%
and force polluters to clean up their
 
04:48:12.510 --> 04:48:12.520 align:start position:0%
contamination um I I think if had that
 
04:48:15.948 --> 04:48:15.958 align:start position:0%
been done when Dees first issued a
 
04:48:19.070 --> 04:48:19.080 align:start position:0%
consent agree um against St gobain we
 
04:48:21.070 --> 04:48:21.080 align:start position:0%
would have never been in this position
 
04:48:23.868 --> 04:48:23.878 align:start position:0%
but um as I said in my testimony at that
 
04:48:27.270 --> 04:48:27.280 align:start position:0%
time um people in miramac were frantic
 
04:48:30.470 --> 04:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
um we were drinking water we were making
 
04:48:33.190 --> 04:48:33.200 align:start position:0%
formula we were showering in water that
 
04:48:35.470 --> 04:48:35.480 align:start position:0%
exceeded even the Environmental
 
04:48:38.948 --> 04:48:38.958 align:start position:0%
Protection agency's Health advisory um
 
04:48:41.548 --> 04:48:41.558 align:start position:0%
so it was it was a desperate time to do
 
04:48:43.990 --> 04:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
what we could to as soon as we could to
 
04:48:47.190 --> 04:48:47.200 align:start position:0%
get that water cleaned up um at that
 
04:48:48.628 --> 04:48:48.638 align:start position:0%
time I don't think we had the
 
04:48:51.548 --> 04:48:51.558 align:start position:0%
information that we had now um I think
 
04:48:53.390 --> 04:48:53.400 align:start position:0%
if we did that settlement agreement
 
04:48:56.310 --> 04:48:56.320 align:start position:0%
would have um lasted as long as it takes
 
04:48:58.430 --> 04:48:58.440 align:start position:0%
to get the water cleaned up but it was
 
04:49:00.750 --> 04:49:00.760 align:start position:0%
only issued for five years and during
 
04:49:03.110 --> 04:49:03.120 align:start position:0%
that time more information about the
 
04:49:07.070 --> 04:49:07.080 align:start position:0%
dangers of F has have come to light but
 
04:49:09.910 --> 04:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
um you know it's my opinion that the
 
04:49:11.670 --> 04:49:11.680 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire Bears the
 
04:49:14.350 --> 04:49:14.360 align:start position:0%
responsibility of forcing companies to
 
04:49:16.868 --> 04:49:16.878 align:start position:0%
comply with their regulatory
 
04:49:19.750 --> 04:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
requirements not municipalities and not
 
04:49:22.670 --> 04:49:22.680 align:start position:0%
water districts okay thank you very much
 
04:49:24.548 --> 04:49:24.558 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for the question
 
04:49:24.558 --> 04:49:26.510 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for the question
representative

04:49:26.510 --> 04:49:26.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:49:28.708 --> 04:49:28.718 align:start position:0%
syvia thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
04:49:30.230 --> 04:49:30.240 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
 
04:49:30.240 --> 04:49:32.628 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
representative

04:49:32.628 --> 04:49:32.638 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:49:35.190 --> 04:49:35.200 align:start position:0%
um just to get a little more background
 
04:49:38.190 --> 04:49:38.200 align:start position:0%
and and fill in the context could you uh
 
04:49:40.910 --> 04:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
two parts could you tell me about when
 
04:49:44.750 --> 04:49:44.760 align:start position:0%
uh st gobain came to marac then at the
 
04:49:46.788 --> 04:49:46.798 align:start position:0%
time that uh it was coming was it
 
04:49:49.310 --> 04:49:49.320 align:start position:0%
encouraged by the town of marac or was
 
04:49:52.030 --> 04:49:52.040 align:start position:0%
it uh
 
04:49:55.948 --> 04:49:55.958 align:start position:0%
protested um oh I think maram uh thank
 
04:49:57.230 --> 04:49:57.240 align:start position:0%
you very much for the question by the
 
04:49:58.830 --> 04:49:58.840 align:start position:0%
way I think marac welcomes all
 
04:50:01.270 --> 04:50:01.280 align:start position:0%
businesses um you know we've got major
 
04:50:04.390 --> 04:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
Employers in town Fidelity Investments
 
04:50:06.788 --> 04:50:06.798 align:start position:0%
anheiser bush has a brewery in marac we
 
04:50:08.590 --> 04:50:08.600 align:start position:0%
have wonderful restaurants I invite all
 
04:50:10.350 --> 04:50:10.360 align:start position:0%
of you to come and enjoy everything that
 
04:50:14.190 --> 04:50:14.200 align:start position:0%
marac has to offer um SLE ban I don't
 
04:50:16.270 --> 04:50:16.280 align:start position:0%
exactly remember the dates and I'm sorry
 
04:50:19.030 --> 04:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
I don't have that information with me um
 
04:50:21.708 --> 04:50:21.718 align:start position:0%
but uh they came to miramac um they had
 
04:50:24.150 --> 04:50:24.160 align:start position:0%
bought a facility um that had been
 
04:50:26.868 --> 04:50:26.878 align:start position:0%
previously a manufacturer of GE jet
 
04:50:29.230 --> 04:50:29.240 align:start position:0%
engines and when they came into marac
 
04:50:30.470 --> 04:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
they were actually a company called
 
04:50:33.310 --> 04:50:33.320 align:start position:0%
chemfab which had operations in um
 
04:50:36.750 --> 04:50:36.760 align:start position:0%
Bennington Vermont in HK Falls New York
 
04:50:39.190 --> 04:50:39.200 align:start position:0%
and they came uh to marac and then uh
 
04:50:41.390 --> 04:50:41.400 align:start position:0%
SLE ban bought Kemp bab and made it part
 
04:50:44.150 --> 04:50:44.160 align:start position:0%
of their performance Plastics division
 
04:50:48.430 --> 04:50:48.440 align:start position:0%
um we did not know at that time um that
 
04:50:51.510 --> 04:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
um their air emissions uh contain such
 
04:50:53.548 --> 04:50:53.558 align:start position:0%
hazardous chemicals in fact at that time
 
04:50:56.670 --> 04:50:56.680 align:start position:0%
I don't think even scientists knew the
 
04:50:58.910 --> 04:50:58.920 align:start position:0%
the the hazards of past to the extent
 
04:51:01.510 --> 04:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
that they know them now um and they
 
04:51:03.910 --> 04:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
weren't regulated those past chemicals
 
04:51:05.510 --> 04:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
and and they're still not really
 
04:51:07.628 --> 04:51:07.638 align:start position:0%
regulated on a federal level Al although
 
04:51:09.948 --> 04:51:09.958 align:start position:0%
I believe that's coming so it was really
 
04:51:14.070 --> 04:51:14.080 align:start position:0%
up to the states to um to regulate them
 
04:51:18.708 --> 04:51:18.718 align:start position:0%
um but but we welcomed um SLE ban um but
 
04:51:22.510 --> 04:51:22.520 align:start position:0%
you know no matter how you know how many
 
04:51:25.990 --> 04:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
employees they hire or employ or or
 
04:51:28.868 --> 04:51:28.878 align:start position:0%
things they do um they're contaminating
 
04:51:30.470 --> 04:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
or drinking water and they're doing it
 
04:51:32.150 --> 04:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
to this
 
04:51:34.548 --> 04:51:34.558 align:start position:0%
day I don't know I forget if I answered
 
04:51:36.350 --> 04:51:36.360 align:start position:0%
both those questions I'm sorry about
 
04:51:38.470 --> 04:51:38.480 align:start position:0%
that the other part was just about when
 
04:51:40.430 --> 04:51:40.440 align:start position:0%
they came but that's all right if I
 
04:51:43.270 --> 04:51:43.280 align:start position:0%
could follow up Mr chairman briefly you
 
04:51:46.190 --> 04:51:46.200 align:start position:0%
may follow up um I assume that over the
 
04:51:48.470 --> 04:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
time that sang gobain has been there
 
04:51:50.510 --> 04:51:50.520 align:start position:0%
they have certainly
 
04:51:54.708 --> 04:51:54.718 align:start position:0%
uh contributed largely to the community
 
04:51:57.990 --> 04:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
the uh pay of workers are probably
 
04:52:00.390 --> 04:52:00.400 align:start position:0%
housed locally there would that be the
 
04:52:02.470 --> 04:52:02.480 align:start position:0%
case uh oh I'm sure there were sanco
 
04:52:04.310 --> 04:52:04.320 align:start position:0%
Bane employees here
 
04:52:07.150 --> 04:52:07.160 align:start position:0%
um and you know I
 
04:52:10.548 --> 04:52:10.558 align:start position:0%
mean I think I mean all anything they
 
04:52:13.548 --> 04:52:13.558 align:start position:0%
could do they're they've poisoned our
 
04:52:18.910 --> 04:52:18.920 align:start position:0%
water um past levels in our water cause
 
04:52:21.670 --> 04:52:21.680 align:start position:0%
infant uh low birth weight premature
 
04:52:24.548 --> 04:52:24.558 align:start position:0%
birth weight um they've been linked to
 
04:52:26.868 --> 04:52:26.878 align:start position:0%
several cancers New Hampshire has the
 
04:52:29.750 --> 04:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
highest incidence of pediatric cancer
 
04:52:31.350 --> 04:52:31.360 align:start position:0%
we've learned a lot about the health
 
04:52:33.390 --> 04:52:33.400 align:start position:0%
impacts of past from what's going on at
 
04:52:35.628 --> 04:52:35.638 align:start position:0%
the P's trade port in a history of
 
04:52:39.510 --> 04:52:39.520 align:start position:0%
firefighting Foams so um I'm not willing
 
04:52:43.390 --> 04:52:43.400 align:start position:0%
to settle uh for poisoned drinking water
 
04:52:45.990 --> 04:52:46.000 align:start position:0%
just to have a good employer in town I
 
04:52:48.070 --> 04:52:48.080 align:start position:0%
think any employer that's going to
 
04:52:50.948 --> 04:52:50.958 align:start position:0%
pollute the a basic necessity of life is
 
04:52:52.868 --> 04:52:52.878 align:start position:0%
not a good employer no matter how many
 
04:52:54.350 --> 04:52:54.360 align:start position:0%
people they employ no matter how many
 
04:52:57.590 --> 04:52:57.600 align:start position:0%
salaries they pay or Community donations
 
04:53:01.470 --> 04:53:01.480 align:start position:0%
they make um safe drinking water has to
 
04:53:04.190 --> 04:53:04.200 align:start position:0%
be a fundamentally protected
 
04:53:06.708 --> 04:53:06.718 align:start position:0%
resource for our
 
04:53:09.708 --> 04:53:09.718 align:start position:0%
communities thank you thank you
 
04:53:09.718 --> 04:53:14.708 align:start position:0%
communities thank you thank you
representative

04:53:14.708 --> 04:53:14.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:17.548 --> 04:53:17.558 align:start position:0%
bur uh thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:53:20.868 --> 04:53:20.878 align:start position:0%
representative Rong I just had a a
 
04:53:23.030 --> 04:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
question to clarify something in my own
 
04:53:26.270 --> 04:53:26.280 align:start position:0%
mind you refer uh
 
04:53:29.110 --> 04:53:29.120 align:start position:0%
throughout uh this agreement is a
 
04:53:32.390 --> 04:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
shortterm settlement and I'm puzzled so
 
04:53:34.948 --> 04:53:34.958 align:start position:0%
perhaps you can explain
 
04:53:37.788 --> 04:53:37.798 align:start position:0%
um is the settlement
 
04:53:42.548 --> 04:53:42.558 align:start position:0%
itself uh Limited in time or just the
 
04:53:46.548 --> 04:53:46.558 align:start position:0%
obligation of St Goan to do certain
 
04:53:50.670 --> 04:53:50.680 align:start position:0%
things are limited uh to five
 
04:53:55.510 --> 04:53:55.520 align:start position:0%
years uh well what is oh thank you for
 
04:53:57.310 --> 04:53:57.320 align:start position:0%
um I'm getting some feedback can you
 
04:54:00.708 --> 04:54:00.718 align:start position:0%
hear me okay yes okay must be on my end
 
04:54:03.788 --> 04:54:03.798 align:start position:0%
um the the settlement agreement allow
 
04:54:05.948 --> 04:54:05.958 align:start position:0%
for St gobain to cover some of the
 
04:54:07.910 --> 04:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
operating and maintenance expenses for
 
04:54:10.230 --> 04:54:10.240 align:start position:0%
five years that's the that's the gist of
 
04:54:13.270 --> 04:54:13.280 align:start position:0%
it after that the burden of continuing
 
04:54:16.150 --> 04:54:16.160 align:start position:0%
the cost of those uh filtration um
 
04:54:19.548 --> 04:54:19.558 align:start position:0%
operations lies on on miramac Village
 
04:54:23.628 --> 04:54:23.638 align:start position:0%
district and we're contesting that um
 
04:54:26.948 --> 04:54:26.958 align:start position:0%
because pasas is a forever chemical
 
04:54:29.270 --> 04:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
because it it is still present in the
 
04:54:33.070 --> 04:54:33.080 align:start position:0%
water coming into those Wells that um
 
04:54:35.510 --> 04:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
that even after that settlement
 
04:54:38.310 --> 04:54:38.320 align:start position:0%
agreement expires Senco Bain should bear
 
04:54:40.510 --> 04:54:40.520 align:start position:0%
the responsibility of cleaning up that
 
04:54:43.390 --> 04:54:43.400 align:start position:0%
water so that it meets the state's U
 
04:54:46.670 --> 04:54:46.680 align:start position:0%
mandated um maximum contaminant levels
 
04:54:50.070 --> 04:54:50.080 align:start position:0%
if you you could if if I may follow up
 
04:54:52.390 --> 04:54:52.400 align:start position:0%
yeah you confuse me in your language
 
04:54:55.310 --> 04:54:55.320 align:start position:0%
about when the settlement agreement
 
04:54:58.830 --> 04:54:58.840 align:start position:0%
expires that's not the same I believe as
 
04:55:02.948 --> 04:55:02.958 align:start position:0%
the obligation of St goar to remediate
 
04:55:05.548 --> 04:55:05.558 align:start position:0%
expire s the agree the settlement
 
04:55:09.750 --> 04:55:09.760 align:start position:0%
agreement is in perpetuity is it not um
 
04:55:12.030 --> 04:55:12.040 align:start position:0%
you know I I have to go back and check
 
04:55:14.708 --> 04:55:14.718 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately I'm not in my office
 
04:55:19.230 --> 04:55:19.240 align:start position:0%
um I I have some I I I'm um I I'm on
 
04:55:21.110 --> 04:55:21.120 align:start position:0%
some personal business so I I don't have
 
04:55:24.788 --> 04:55:24.798 align:start position:0%
all my files with me but um my
 
04:55:25.868 --> 04:55:25.878 align:start position:0%
understanding and there's probably
 
04:55:27.590 --> 04:55:27.600 align:start position:0%
others that are going to testify that
 
04:55:29.510 --> 04:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
have answers to this question is that
 
04:55:33.788 --> 04:55:33.798 align:start position:0%
SLE Bane is not taking necessar neily
 
04:55:35.868 --> 04:55:35.878 align:start position:0%
the responsibility for
 
04:55:38.628 --> 04:55:38.638 align:start position:0%
remediation they're just contributing
 
04:55:40.868 --> 04:55:40.878 align:start position:0%
monies and even the monies they're
 
04:55:44.470 --> 04:55:44.480 align:start position:0%
contributing are finite it's not uh it's
 
04:55:46.350 --> 04:55:46.360 align:start position:0%
a set amount it's it's they're not
 
04:55:48.670 --> 04:55:48.680 align:start position:0%
covering the exact cost they're they're
 
04:55:51.390 --> 04:55:51.400 align:start position:0%
giving so much money and that those
 
04:55:53.990 --> 04:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
monies go away after five
 
04:55:58.390 --> 04:55:58.400 align:start position:0%
years thank you representative P thank
 
04:56:00.190 --> 04:56:00.200 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:56:01.590 --> 04:56:01.600 align:start position:0%
representative rung for taking my
 
04:56:02.910 --> 04:56:02.920 align:start position:0%
question if you're not the right person
 
04:56:05.670 --> 04:56:05.680 align:start position:0%
for this question then um you can defer
 
04:56:07.948 --> 04:56:07.958 align:start position:0%
me to who might be in the testimony
 
04:56:10.470 --> 04:56:10.480 align:start position:0%
later um I want to go back to the moment
 
04:56:12.190 --> 04:56:12.200 align:start position:0%
in time when the settlement agreement
 
04:56:15.230 --> 04:56:15.240 align:start position:0%
was made you described um kind of a
 
04:56:18.430 --> 04:56:18.440 align:start position:0%
chaotic situation in marac given the
 
04:56:20.708 --> 04:56:20.718 align:start position:0%
sort of desperation I think you said and
 
04:56:22.510 --> 04:56:22.520 align:start position:0%
I know you weren't part of the
 
04:56:24.948 --> 04:56:24.958 align:start position:0%
settlement agreement and I'm just in I
 
04:56:26.628 --> 04:56:26.638 align:start position:0%
was reading a testimony from someone who
 
04:56:28.230 --> 04:56:28.240 align:start position:0%
was in the water district that sent a
 
04:56:30.350 --> 04:56:30.360 align:start position:0%
letter that said on advice of town
 
04:56:33.310 --> 04:56:33.320 align:start position:0%
counsil he's not going to testify uh
 
04:56:35.548 --> 04:56:35.558 align:start position:0%
today but perhaps you can tell us a
 
04:56:38.910 --> 04:56:38.920 align:start position:0%
little bit you said the past science has
 
04:56:41.350 --> 04:56:41.360 align:start position:0%
changed since then the knowledge I'm
 
04:56:42.708 --> 04:56:42.718 align:start position:0%
wondering if there's anything that you
 
04:56:47.030 --> 04:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
know of that at that time St gobain knew
 
04:56:50.670 --> 04:56:50.680 align:start position:0%
about past that you didn't know that
 
04:56:52.070 --> 04:56:52.080 align:start position:0%
would have been incred would have been
 
04:56:54.750 --> 04:56:54.760 align:start position:0%
material to the length of their
 
04:56:56.750 --> 04:56:56.760 align:start position:0%
obligation and you may I don't expect
 
04:56:58.670 --> 04:56:58.680 align:start position:0%
you would know this but but maybe you do
 
04:57:01.350 --> 04:57:01.360 align:start position:0%
or can point us to someone that might
 
04:57:03.788 --> 04:57:03.798 align:start position:0%
sort of material information about the
 
04:57:05.310 --> 04:57:05.320 align:start position:0%
nature of
 
04:57:08.708 --> 04:57:08.718 align:start position:0%
pasas that might that might change sort
 
04:57:11.788 --> 04:57:11.798 align:start position:0%
of the The Horizon for Our
 
04:57:13.990 --> 04:57:14.000 align:start position:0%
obligation thank you very much for that
 
04:57:16.510 --> 04:57:16.520 align:start position:0%
question representative um one of the
 
04:57:18.990 --> 04:57:19.000 align:start position:0%
things that um I became aware of after
 
04:57:21.628 --> 04:57:21.638 align:start position:0%
the settlement agreement was reached is
 
04:57:24.830 --> 04:57:24.840 align:start position:0%
that the town of husk Falls New York um
 
04:57:28.110 --> 04:57:28.120 align:start position:0%
where s gobain had had had also
 
04:57:31.548 --> 04:57:31.558 align:start position:0%
contaminated uh with pasas um they had
 
04:57:33.910 --> 04:57:33.920 align:start position:0%
reached an agreement with who Falls that
 
04:57:36.350 --> 04:57:36.360 align:start position:0%
provides for long-term remediation I
 
04:57:38.270 --> 04:57:38.280 align:start position:0%
don't even I think it's in perpetuity
 
04:57:40.510 --> 04:57:40.520 align:start position:0%
but don't quote me on that um and
 
04:57:42.350 --> 04:57:42.360 align:start position:0%
they're covering the cost it's not like
 
04:57:46.510 --> 04:57:46.520 align:start position:0%
a set amount so I felt um they knew when
 
04:57:48.350 --> 04:57:48.360 align:start position:0%
they went into that settlement agreement
 
04:57:50.390 --> 04:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
that the cost of remediation is much
 
04:57:53.110 --> 04:57:53.120 align:start position:0%
much higher I think uh and this is just
 
04:57:54.990 --> 04:57:55.000 align:start position:0%
my opinion but I felt that they took
 
04:57:57.430 --> 04:57:57.440 align:start position:0%
advantage of our desperation to get
 
04:57:59.230 --> 04:57:59.240 align:start position:0%
clean drinking water because you have to
 
04:58:00.948 --> 04:58:00.958 align:start position:0%
imagine Wells four and five are the
 
04:58:02.910 --> 04:58:02.920 align:start position:0%
largest producers of the marac village
 
04:58:06.430 --> 04:58:06.440 align:start position:0%
dist District so um this was a big
 
04:58:08.910 --> 04:58:08.920 align:start position:0%
concern for people in miramac had we
 
04:58:11.708 --> 04:58:11.718 align:start position:0%
known at that time that Seno bang was
 
04:58:15.548 --> 04:58:15.558 align:start position:0%
already aware of and had already entered
 
04:58:17.868 --> 04:58:17.878 align:start position:0%
into agreement with the town in New York
 
04:58:20.510 --> 04:58:20.520 align:start position:0%
and had provided much High much more
 
04:58:22.390 --> 04:58:22.400 align:start position:0%
considerable support for their water
 
04:58:24.390 --> 04:58:24.400 align:start position:0%
cleanup and taken much more
 
04:58:26.390 --> 04:58:26.400 align:start position:0%
responsibility I think our NE our
 
04:58:30.830 --> 04:58:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:35.670 --> 04:58:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:37.868 --> 04:58:37.878 align:start position:0%
representative seeing none thank you for
 
04:58:41.190 --> 04:58:41.200 align:start position:0%

04:59:19.708 --> 04:59:19.718 align:start position:0%
speaker Dick hinch had on his list as a
 
04:59:21.670 --> 04:59:21.680 align:start position:0%
priority for the citizens of

MVD we have had to deal with the wells
 
04:59:49.708 --> 04:59:49.718 align:start position:0%
belonging to the MVD being shut down due
 
04:59:52.750 --> 04:59:52.760 align:start position:0%
to high past contamination rates this in
 
04:59:54.628 --> 04:59:54.638 align:start position:0%
turn causes issues especially in the

summer when the demand is high the MBD
 
04:59:59.470 --> 04:59:59.480 align:start position:0%
has had to purchase water from other
 
05:00:01.430 --> 05:00:01.440 align:start position:0%
sources to meet the demand which then
 
05:00:03.628 --> 05:00:03.638 align:start position:0%
raises the cost of the water for all of
 
05:00:06.110 --> 05:00:06.120 align:start position:0%
customers while St gobain agreed to pay
 
05:00:08.030 --> 05:00:08.040 align:start position:0%
to filter the contaminated Wells the

price to filter the water from the MVD
 
05:00:13.430 --> 05:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
Wells was over $5 million of which St
 
05:00:16.948 --> 05:00:16.958 align:start position:0%

the current pooa concentration will
 
05:01:13.150 --> 05:01:13.160 align:start position:0%
require approximately three lives or 300

maintenance cost for only five years the
 
05:01:28.070 --> 05:01:28.080 align:start position:0%
equivalent of a blink of an eye when you
 
05:01:29.510 --> 05:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
look at it from the perspective of how
 
05:01:32.350 --> 05:01:32.360 align:start position:0%
long a contamination will last you may
 
05:01:34.430 --> 05:01:34.440 align:start position:0%
ask yourself self it's important and
 
05:01:36.030 --> 05:01:36.040 align:start position:0%
shouldn't the customers and Ray payers
 
05:01:38.310 --> 05:01:38.320 align:start position:0%
just pay for it the the customers of

letter to you previously expressing our
 
05:03:24.830 --> 05:03:24.840 align:start position:0%
support my testimony here today is
 
05:03:27.190 --> 05:03:27.200 align:start position:0%
seeking to amplify that particular
 
05:03:28.948 --> 05:03:28.958 align:start position:0%
letter letter that was sent to you under
 
05:03:31.750 --> 05:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
separate cover there are three specific
 
05:03:35.390 --> 05:03:35.400 align:start position:0%
points that I would like to or two two
 
05:03:37.788 --> 05:03:37.798 align:start position:0%
specific topics that I'd like to get
 
05:03:40.110 --> 05:03:40.120 align:start position:0%
into first off is the settlement
 
05:03:42.350 --> 05:03:42.360 align:start position:0%
agreement between Sango ban and MBD for
 
05:03:43.990 --> 05:03:44.000 align:start position:0%
as it relates to lws four and five which
 
05:03:46.628 --> 05:03:46.638 align:start position:0%
is an agreement that occurred in
 
05:03:46.638 --> 05:03:47.948 align:start position:0%
is an agreement that occurred in
February

05:03:47.948 --> 05:03:47.958 align:start position:0%
February
 
05:03:51.590 --> 05:03:51.600 align:start position:0%
2018 on on April 1 Dees had issued a
 
05:03:54.830 --> 05:03:54.840 align:start position:0%
letter to S to Sango ban mandating that
 
05:03:57.470 --> 05:03:57.480 align:start position:0%
they pay for ongoing operation and
 
05:04:00.390 --> 05:04:00.400 align:start position:0%
maintenance of posos treatment at all of
 
05:04:03.190 --> 05:04:03.200 align:start position:0%
of nbd's public Supply Wells and at that
 
05:04:05.788 --> 05:04:05.798 align:start position:0%
particular Point Dees and the AG's
 
05:04:07.628 --> 05:04:07.638 align:start position:0%
office chose not to issue a descent
 
05:04:10.310 --> 05:04:10.320 align:start position:0%
excuse me a consent decree against Sango
 
05:04:12.470 --> 05:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
ban as it relates to that
 
05:04:15.190 --> 05:04:15.200 align:start position:0%
contamination MBD as a consequence was
 
05:04:16.910 --> 05:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
required to negotiate its own settlement
 
05:04:18.670 --> 05:04:18.680 align:start position:0%
agreement with Sango ban without the
 
05:04:22.510 --> 05:04:22.520 align:start position:0%
assistance of Dees or AG that settlement
 
05:04:24.430 --> 05:04:24.440 align:start position:0%
agreement requires Sango ban to pay for
 
05:04:27.788 --> 05:04:27.798 align:start position:0%
a portion of posos treatment MBD Wells
 
05:04:29.310 --> 05:04:29.320 align:start position:0%
four and five but it only requires
 
05:04:32.788 --> 05:04:32.798 align:start position:0%
Sangle ban to pay for the what what I
 
05:04:34.990 --> 05:04:35.000 align:start position:0%
you know the the Gak the media the
 
05:04:37.548 --> 05:04:37.558 align:start position:0%
filter media change outs that's only
 
05:04:39.670 --> 05:04:39.680 align:start position:0%
paid for for five years and it's
 
05:04:42.110 --> 05:04:42.120 align:start position:0%
important to note that it's only five
 
05:04:43.548 --> 05:04:43.558 align:start position:0%
years that they're paying for that for
 
05:04:45.670 --> 05:04:45.680 align:start position:0%
that particular maintenance piece
 
05:04:49.788 --> 05:04:49.798 align:start position:0%
consequently the refusal of Dees to
 
05:04:52.628 --> 05:04:52.638 align:start position:0%
issue a consent decree on mb's behalf is
 
05:04:55.110 --> 05:04:55.120 align:start position:0%
the in is the inconsistency that House
 
05:04:58.868 --> 05:04:58.878 align:start position:0%
Bill H uh HB 478 is seeking to
 
05:05:02.030 --> 05:05:02.040 align:start position:0%
correct secondly the state the state
 
05:05:04.470 --> 05:05:04.480 align:start position:0%
agreement consent decree negotiated by
 
05:05:06.430 --> 05:05:06.440 align:start position:0%
the state with sang go Baine in 20 in
 
05:05:08.910 --> 05:05:08.920 align:start position:0%
March of 2018 as it relates to the
 
05:05:11.270 --> 05:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
private relates to the effective private
 
05:05:14.110 --> 05:05:14.120 align:start position:0%
Wells which were excluded from the
 
05:05:15.788 --> 05:05:15.798 align:start position:0%
original consent
 
05:05:17.670 --> 05:05:17.680 align:start position:0%
order one of the things that they
 
05:05:19.190 --> 05:05:19.200 align:start position:0%
developed was a groundwater management
 
05:05:21.590 --> 05:05:21.600 align:start position:0%
Zone otherwise known as a gmz and it
 
05:05:23.150 --> 05:05:23.160 align:start position:0%
delineated both parties and it also
 
05:05:25.548 --> 05:05:25.558 align:start position:0%
included areas not just marac but it
 
05:05:27.590 --> 05:05:27.600 align:start position:0%
include also included the communities of
 
05:05:31.110 --> 05:05:31.120 align:start position:0%
Manchester Lichfield and Bedford two gmz
 
05:05:33.430 --> 05:05:33.440 align:start position:0%
boundaries were Del were delineate one a
 
05:05:36.310 --> 05:05:36.320 align:start position:0%
preliminary inner boundary and an out of
 
05:05:38.910 --> 05:05:38.920 align:start position:0%
boundary which limited the extent of
 
05:05:42.190 --> 05:05:42.200 align:start position:0%
Sango Ban's responsibility Sango ban is
 
05:05:43.990 --> 05:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
required to mitigate all posos
 
05:05:46.548 --> 05:05:46.558 align:start position:0%
contaminated private Wells within the
 
05:05:49.910 --> 05:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
pegmc area please keep in mind what's
 
05:05:52.190 --> 05:05:52.200 align:start position:0%
not mentioned is that MVD Wells four and
 
05:05:56.708 --> 05:05:56.718 align:start position:0%
five are inside that preg GMC in most
 
05:05:59.510 --> 05:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
boundary similar to the private Wells
 
05:06:02.110 --> 05:06:02.120 align:start position:0%
required to be regulated one of the
 
05:06:03.670 --> 05:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
things that that private well consent
 
05:06:06.230 --> 05:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
degree did was to provide bottled water
 
05:06:07.628 --> 05:06:07.638 align:start position:0%
with private Wells to people with
 
05:06:09.590 --> 05:06:09.600 align:start position:0%
private Wells within that preg
 
05:06:11.628 --> 05:06:11.638 align:start position:0%
gmz they were able to pay for an
 
05:06:13.270 --> 05:06:13.280 align:start position:0%
extension in connection to private Wells
 
05:06:15.990 --> 05:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
for available Public Water Supplies if
 
05:06:17.548 --> 05:06:17.558 align:start position:0%
if I know you folks have been paying
 
05:06:19.590 --> 05:06:19.600 align:start position:0%
attention to L field benefited from
 
05:06:22.628 --> 05:06:22.638 align:start position:0%
connections with penetr water supply and
 
05:06:24.470 --> 05:06:24.480 align:start position:0%
then part of the other thing was to pay
 
05:06:25.868 --> 05:06:25.878 align:start position:0%
for future private Wells to be
 
05:06:28.310 --> 05:06:28.320 align:start position:0%
determined level the contamination and
 
05:06:30.708 --> 05:06:30.718 align:start position:0%
to determine whether or not is a is a
 
05:06:33.230 --> 05:06:33.240 align:start position:0%
point of entry treatment and you know uh
 
05:06:35.708 --> 05:06:35.718 align:start position:0%
home filter is going to be beneficial or
 
05:06:37.070 --> 05:06:37.080 align:start position:0%
whether or not they need to be hooked up
 
05:06:39.190 --> 05:06:39.200 align:start position:0%
to to private to a to a public water
 
05:06:42.030 --> 05:06:42.040 align:start position:0%
supply EXC excuse me so at the end of
 
05:06:45.070 --> 05:06:45.080 align:start position:0%
the day what what all this means is that
 
05:06:48.590 --> 05:06:48.600 align:start position:0%
Sango Bain is obligated at least from
 
05:06:51.070 --> 05:06:51.080 align:start position:0%
from my perspective is obligated to pay
 
05:06:52.750 --> 05:06:52.760 align:start position:0%
for the point of entry treatment
 
05:06:55.070 --> 05:06:55.080 align:start position:0%
including the change out of the of the
 
05:06:58.548 --> 05:06:58.558 align:start position:0%
fil of the filter media because Dees
 
05:07:00.788 --> 05:07:00.798 align:start position:0%
chose not to issue a consent order
 
05:07:02.470 --> 05:07:02.480 align:start position:0%
regarding the contaminations that means
 
05:07:04.590 --> 05:07:04.600 align:start position:0%
after five years those chain those
 
05:07:06.230 --> 05:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
change outs are now going to be the
 
05:07:08.350 --> 05:07:08.360 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the rate of the rate
 
05:07:11.590 --> 05:07:11.600 align:start position:0%
of of of the private well owners and MVD
 
05:07:13.990 --> 05:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
the uh the rate pay is to MVD for Wells
 
05:07:17.150 --> 05:07:17.160 align:start position:0%
four and five MVD customers are going to
 
05:07:20.708 --> 05:07:20.718 align:start position:0%
be paying to treat M these Wells for a
 
05:07:24.030 --> 05:07:24.040 align:start position:0%
very long period of time so why should
 
05:07:26.830 --> 05:07:26.840 align:start position:0%
MBD customers be required to pay to
 
05:07:28.910 --> 05:07:28.920 align:start position:0%
treat something that is the
 
05:07:30.948 --> 05:07:30.958 align:start position:0%
responsibility of someone else and in
 
05:07:34.708 --> 05:07:34.718 align:start position:0%
this case edly Sango ban as I stated
 
05:07:36.948 --> 05:07:36.958 align:start position:0%
initially MVD Wells 4 and5 the subject
 
05:07:39.990 --> 05:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
of HP 478 are located within the preg
 
05:07:42.948 --> 05:07:42.958 align:start position:0%
gmz boundary just like the private Wells
 
05:07:45.830 --> 05:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
are again the same also applies to them
 
05:07:47.868 --> 05:07:47.878 align:start position:0%
why should they be paying for their own
 
05:07:50.628 --> 05:07:50.638 align:start position:0%
treatment at the end of the day from my
 
05:07:53.390 --> 05:07:53.400 align:start position:0%
from my perspective a regulatory flow
 
05:07:56.070 --> 05:07:56.080 align:start position:0%
exists within the laws whereby DS and
 
05:07:58.390 --> 05:07:58.400 align:start position:0%
and the AG's office really did not or
 
05:08:01.430 --> 05:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
could not act on behalf of of MD MBD
 
05:08:03.750 --> 05:08:03.760 align:start position:0%
customers by being able to negotiate a
 
05:08:06.310 --> 05:08:06.320 align:start position:0%
con a consent agree for Wells 4 and five
 
05:08:08.628 --> 05:08:08.638 align:start position:0%
so subsequently this is an opportunity
 
05:08:11.390 --> 05:08:11.400 align:start position:0%
to correct that regulatory floor I thank
 
05:08:12.990 --> 05:08:13.000 align:start position:0%
the chairman and the committee members
 
05:08:15.510 --> 05:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
for the opportunity to present and I'm
 
05:08:16.990 --> 05:08:17.000 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any
 
05:08:19.590 --> 05:08:19.600 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Mr Boyd
 
05:08:19.600 --> 05:08:21.150 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Mr Boyd
representative

05:08:21.150 --> 05:08:21.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:08:26.310 --> 05:08:26.320 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you Mr chairman um Mr Boyd I
 
05:08:29.190 --> 05:08:29.200 align:start position:0%
I have to begin by saying that I am in
 
05:08:34.628 --> 05:08:34.638 align:start position:0%
awe of the knowledge um and the degree
 
05:08:40.470 --> 05:08:40.480 align:start position:0%
that you and your colleagues um go into
 
05:08:44.990 --> 05:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
this issue and so forgive me for asking
 
05:08:48.868 --> 05:08:48.878 align:start position:0%
a very naive question um that's okay
 
05:08:51.868 --> 05:08:51.878 align:start position:0%
representative Smith thank you very much
 
05:08:54.990 --> 05:08:55.000 align:start position:0%
that makes me feel better
 
05:09:00.230 --> 05:09:00.240 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm one I have two one question
 
05:09:02.830 --> 05:09:02.840 align:start position:0%
but there kind of two parts to it one
 
05:09:06.030 --> 05:09:06.040 align:start position:0%
again and again and again in the
 
05:09:10.230 --> 05:09:10.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have cities and towns
 
05:09:15.030 --> 05:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
expressing annoyance at the state for
 
05:09:18.510 --> 05:09:18.520 align:start position:0%
getting involved in what cities and
 
05:09:21.470 --> 05:09:21.480 align:start position:0%
towns see as
 
05:09:24.470 --> 05:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
their prerogative to make decisions
 
05:09:26.430 --> 05:09:26.440 align:start position:0%
about what happens in their
 
05:09:31.310 --> 05:09:31.320 align:start position:0%
communities and here I see quite the
 
05:09:33.750 --> 05:09:33.760 align:start position:0%
opposite that you you really want the
 
05:09:38.628 --> 05:09:38.638 align:start position:0%
state to get in and kind of take over uh
 
05:09:41.270 --> 05:09:41.280 align:start position:0%
directing Sano go about what they have
 
05:09:45.750 --> 05:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
to do and the other side of that is I
 
05:09:50.868 --> 05:09:50.878 align:start position:0%
hear you saying that the
 
05:09:50.878 --> 05:09:52.470 align:start position:0%
hear you saying that the
department

05:09:52.470 --> 05:09:52.480 align:start position:0%
department
 
05:09:57.750 --> 05:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
um refused to take
 
05:10:00.830 --> 05:10:00.840 align:start position:0%
steps that you think might have helped
 
05:10:04.230 --> 05:10:04.240 align:start position:0%
resolve the issue and of course while
 
05:10:06.390 --> 05:10:06.400 align:start position:0%
we're the legislative branch we really
 
05:10:08.788 --> 05:10:08.798 align:start position:0%
are pretty closely related to the
 
05:10:13.310 --> 05:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
executive branch and all of that comes
 
05:10:17.190 --> 05:10:17.200 align:start position:0%
together for why don't you see the
 
05:10:21.230 --> 05:10:21.240 align:start position:0%
resolution as going to the third branch
 
05:10:24.230 --> 05:10:24.240 align:start position:0%
to the judicial branch to resolve these
 
05:10:26.628 --> 05:10:26.638 align:start position:0%
differences does that make any sense to
 
05:10:29.230 --> 05:10:29.240 align:start position:0%
you Mr Boyd absolutely and I and I made
 
05:10:31.750 --> 05:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
three quick notes so representative says
 
05:10:32.708 --> 05:10:32.718 align:start position:0%
thank you than you so much for the
 
05:10:36.030 --> 05:10:36.040 align:start position:0%
question I do appreciate it the the
 
05:10:37.708 --> 05:10:37.718 align:start position:0%
state if the state can't get involved
 
05:10:39.270 --> 05:10:39.280 align:start position:0%
because they don't have the tools to get
 
05:10:42.470 --> 05:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
involved then that that they're only
 
05:10:44.190 --> 05:10:44.200 align:start position:0%
follow they're only playing by the rules
 
05:10:46.030 --> 05:10:46.040 align:start position:0%
by what is handed down to them
 
05:10:48.590 --> 05:10:48.600 align:start position:0%
legislatively or what gets communicated
 
05:10:50.070 --> 05:10:50.080 align:start position:0%
through them and and again I'm not
 
05:10:52.430 --> 05:10:52.440 align:start position:0%
familiar with how things operate up in
 
05:10:55.470 --> 05:10:55.480 align:start position:0%
conquer but you know the JL cars uh
 
05:10:58.390 --> 05:10:58.400 align:start position:0%
committee is obviously responsible for
 
05:11:00.190 --> 05:11:00.200 align:start position:0%
you know any legislation that's signed
 
05:11:02.390 --> 05:11:02.400 align:start position:0%
into law and is promulgated forward it's
 
05:11:03.910 --> 05:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
them that creates the rules for those
 
05:11:06.788 --> 05:11:06.798 align:start position:0%
particular laws and Dees can only
 
05:11:09.150 --> 05:11:09.160 align:start position:0%
operate within within those particular
 
05:11:11.628 --> 05:11:11.638 align:start position:0%
parameters so you know that that's
 
05:11:13.910 --> 05:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
number I don't for me from where I said
 
05:11:15.868 --> 05:11:15.878 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure it's a ref refusal which is
 
05:11:18.510 --> 05:11:18.520 align:start position:0%
why I said it's it's it's a the proposed
 
05:11:20.830 --> 05:11:20.840 align:start position:0%
legislations to correct the flaw it's
 
05:11:22.830 --> 05:11:22.840 align:start position:0%
it's the ability to be able to to have
 
05:11:25.430 --> 05:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
that particular impact number
 
05:11:28.350 --> 05:11:28.360 align:start position:0%
two I am just so you know as as a town
 
05:11:30.670 --> 05:11:30.680 align:start position:0%
counsel I am very much a local control
 
05:11:33.788 --> 05:11:33.798 align:start position:0%
kind of person I want my town to be able
 
05:11:36.590 --> 05:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
to self-determine and decide what are
 
05:11:39.310 --> 05:11:39.320 align:start position:0%
the things that we need to be resolving
 
05:11:42.030 --> 05:11:42.040 align:start position:0%
to maintain and promote our quality life
 
05:11:44.868 --> 05:11:44.878 align:start position:0%
here in March this why we this is why
 
05:11:46.510 --> 05:11:46.520 align:start position:0%
the town of March filed for injective
 
05:11:48.750 --> 05:11:48.760 align:start position:0%
relief in Hillsboro Superior Court in
 
05:11:50.070 --> 05:11:50.080 align:start position:0%
Department the department of of
 
05:11:51.868 --> 05:11:51.878 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services ironically had
 
05:11:54.590 --> 05:11:54.600 align:start position:0%
filed suit uh earlier in that particular
 
05:11:57.030 --> 05:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
day but we we chose to take the bull by
 
05:11:59.628 --> 05:11:59.638 align:start position:0%
the horns because the facts was the
 
05:12:01.070 --> 05:12:01.080 align:start position:0%
facts and the data were certainly on our
 
05:12:04.510 --> 05:12:04.520 align:start position:0%
site to seek injunctive relief at at the
 
05:12:09.230 --> 05:12:09.240 align:start position:0%
court level if if we have if we have the
 
05:12:12.788 --> 05:12:12.798 align:start position:0%
ability to issue building permits you
 
05:12:14.230 --> 05:12:14.240 align:start position:0%
know talking about just talking in
 
05:12:17.190 --> 05:12:17.200 align:start position:0%
general and if somebody doesn't follow
 
05:12:20.070 --> 05:12:20.080 align:start position:0%
that building permit we have the ability
 
05:12:22.948 --> 05:12:22.958 align:start position:0%
to enforce that that that person do what
 
05:12:25.150 --> 05:12:25.160 align:start position:0%
they need to do to subscribe to that
 
05:12:27.548 --> 05:12:27.558 align:start position:0%
same building permit it's it's the same
 
05:12:29.510 --> 05:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
concept with sang gobain if we tell sang
 
05:12:31.590 --> 05:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
gobain to cease and assist because they
 
05:12:33.230 --> 05:12:33.240 align:start position:0%
have met the rules of what's going on in
 
05:12:35.670 --> 05:12:35.680 align:start position:0%
town and they ignore us we H we have to
 
05:12:37.548 --> 05:12:37.558 align:start position:0%
go we have to ask the state say can you
 
05:12:39.470 --> 05:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
can you join us because we're not
 
05:12:40.990 --> 05:12:41.000 align:start position:0%
getting the relief we're not getting the
 
05:12:44.390 --> 05:12:44.400 align:start position:0%
remedy from this particular individual
 
05:12:46.910 --> 05:12:46.920 align:start position:0%
in our community who's not choosing to
 
05:12:48.430 --> 05:12:48.440 align:start position:0%
listen to us and is not choosing to play
 
05:12:51.750 --> 05:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
by the rules so at at the end of at the
 
05:12:54.430 --> 05:12:54.440 align:start position:0%
end of the at the end of the day um as
 
05:12:58.150 --> 05:12:58.160 align:start position:0%
it relates to this particular bill in in
 
05:13:00.350 --> 05:13:00.360 align:start position:0%
light of your question you know we're
 
05:13:01.548 --> 05:13:01.558 align:start position:0%
just trying to make the rules fair for
 
05:13:01.558 --> 05:13:02.910 align:start position:0%
just trying to make the rules fair for
every

05:13:02.910 --> 05:13:02.920 align:start position:0%
every
 
05:13:05.230 --> 05:13:05.240 align:start position:0%
body thank you does that make sense
 
05:13:07.150 --> 05:13:07.160 align:start position:0%
representative thank you very much for
 
05:13:09.510 --> 05:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
your response I appreciate it thank you
 
05:13:12.590 --> 05:13:12.600 align:start position:0%

05:13:12.600 --> 05:13:15.670 align:start position:0%
any other questions Mr buy
representative

05:13:15.670 --> 05:13:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:18.070 --> 05:13:18.080 align:start position:0%
Langley thank you Mr chair for taking my
 
05:13:19.910 --> 05:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
question and thank you Mr
 
05:13:22.868 --> 05:13:22.878 align:start position:0%
Boyd I have some anxiety about asking
 
05:13:26.310 --> 05:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
this question but I I need to put it out
 
05:13:30.070 --> 05:13:30.080 align:start position:0%
there running between the towns of um
 
05:13:34.430 --> 05:13:34.440 align:start position:0%
miramac and londondary is um no l yes
 
05:13:37.070 --> 05:13:37.080 align:start position:0%
londondary in Mar Lichfield in lond
 
05:13:41.030 --> 05:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
excuse me is the marac river correct and
 
05:13:45.390 --> 05:13:45.400 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering has that been tested and
 
05:13:48.190 --> 05:13:48.200 align:start position:0%
for uh runoff from some of these Wells
 
05:13:50.948 --> 05:13:50.958 align:start position:0%
are just the groundwater into the river
 
05:13:52.590 --> 05:13:52.600 align:start position:0%
from the two sites that have already
 
05:13:55.070 --> 05:13:55.080 align:start position:0%
been identified I appreciate your
 
05:13:56.830 --> 05:13:56.840 align:start position:0%
question thank you very much uh
 
05:13:59.310 --> 05:13:59.320 align:start position:0%
currently on Sango bang site they have
 
05:14:02.110 --> 05:14:02.120 align:start position:0%
two testing Wells both of those testing
 
05:14:07.230 --> 05:14:07.240 align:start position:0%
Wells continue to exceed the limits of
 
05:14:08.670 --> 05:14:08.680 align:start position:0%
what the state has determined to be an
 
05:14:11.548 --> 05:14:11.558 align:start position:0%
acceptable level of peos it's the the
 
05:14:13.628 --> 05:14:13.638 align:start position:0%
last number that I saw and I'm probably
 
05:14:16.750 --> 05:14:16.760 align:start position:0%
going to cause my assistant DBW director
 
05:14:20.270 --> 05:14:20.280 align:start position:0%
a little bit of uh indigestion but I
 
05:14:23.390 --> 05:14:23.400 align:start position:0%
think it was you know 1500 to 2,000
 
05:14:25.708 --> 05:14:25.718 align:start position:0%
parts per trilon were found in those
 
05:14:27.628 --> 05:14:27.638 align:start position:0%
particular it was found in those
 
05:14:30.708 --> 05:14:30.718 align:start position:0%
particular testing Wells um one of the
 
05:14:32.670 --> 05:14:32.680 align:start position:0%
things that we' we we've asked you know
 
05:14:34.548 --> 05:14:34.558 align:start position:0%
and and as you're familiar with our ms4
 
05:14:36.708 --> 05:14:36.718 align:start position:0%
storm water permit you know that's one
 
05:14:38.990 --> 05:14:39.000 align:start position:0%
of the things that the town is concerned
 
05:14:40.990 --> 05:14:41.000 align:start position:0%
that there may be addition additional
 
05:14:43.230 --> 05:14:43.240 align:start position:0%
cost as a result of that particular
 
05:14:45.910 --> 05:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
cleanup so circling you know based on
 
05:14:48.628 --> 05:14:48.638 align:start position:0%
the evidence that has been communicated
 
05:14:52.510 --> 05:14:52.520 align:start position:0%
the probability of posos running off of
 
05:14:55.190 --> 05:14:55.200 align:start position:0%
Sango Bain's property into testing Wells
 
05:14:58.788 --> 05:14:58.798 align:start position:0%
into groundwater um and then you know
 
05:15:01.190 --> 05:15:01.200 align:start position:0%
percolating up and moving moving south
 
05:15:04.150 --> 05:15:04.160 align:start position:0%
into the MRE is very prevalent it it is
 
05:15:05.948 --> 05:15:05.958 align:start position:0%
happening to what levels I don't I have
 
05:15:08.350 --> 05:15:08.360 align:start position:0%
not seen I haven't seen a report on on
 
05:15:10.070 --> 05:15:10.080 align:start position:0%
posos levels in the mar MC rer for a
 
05:15:12.390 --> 05:15:12.400 align:start position:0%
couple years and I know when when this
 
05:15:14.590 --> 05:15:14.600 align:start position:0%
when the onset of this occurred problem
 
05:15:17.070 --> 05:15:17.080 align:start position:0%
occurred back in 2016 they were
 
05:15:20.150 --> 05:15:20.160 align:start position:0%
identifying levels of posos in the marac
 
05:15:23.110 --> 05:15:23.120 align:start position:0%
re thank you Mr boy you're
 
05:15:27.788 --> 05:15:27.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:30.548 --> 05:15:30.558 align:start position:0%
Bo yes representative De
 
05:15:30.558 --> 05:15:32.830 align:start position:0%
Bo yes representative De
Lorenzo

05:15:32.830 --> 05:15:32.840 align:start position:0%
Lorenzo
 
05:15:34.670 --> 05:15:34.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you Mr Boyd
 
05:15:36.590 --> 05:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
for taking my question seems like there
 
05:15:38.430 --> 05:15:38.440 align:start position:0%
are a lot of layers here and it's really
 
05:15:41.548 --> 05:15:41.558 align:start position:0%
hard to figure out um you know who's
 
05:15:43.750 --> 05:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
going to carry the ball on this and my
 
05:15:48.430 --> 05:15:48.440 align:start position:0%
thought is had has the um Town contacted
 
05:15:53.310 --> 05:15:53.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:56.270 --> 05:15:56.280 align:start position:0%
issue the short answer is
 
05:16:00.110 --> 05:16:00.120 align:start position:0%
no and may I follow up May is there a
 
05:16:02.270 --> 05:16:02.280 align:start position:0%
reason why you the town has not
 
05:16:05.190 --> 05:16:05.200 align:start position:0%
contacted the EPA since it sounds as if
 
05:16:08.070 --> 05:16:08.080 align:start position:0%
um you couldn't get satisfaction from
 
05:16:11.470 --> 05:16:11.480 align:start position:0%
Dees or the Attorney General's office I
 
05:16:13.548 --> 05:16:13.558 align:start position:0%
I think if I would and I'm not trying to
 
05:16:15.510 --> 05:16:15.520 align:start position:0%
be I'm not trying to be Ki
 
05:16:18.390 --> 05:16:18.400 align:start position:0%
representative um that what you're
 
05:16:20.270 --> 05:16:20.280 align:start position:0%
asking could constitute being part of
 
05:16:22.070 --> 05:16:22.080 align:start position:0%
the town's legal strategy and I
 
05:16:23.788 --> 05:16:23.798 align:start position:0%
certainly would not want to offer a
 
05:16:25.510 --> 05:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
statement that may compromise any legal
 
05:16:30.470 --> 05:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:30.480 --> 05:16:32.470 align:start position:0%
 
you

05:16:32.470 --> 05:16:32.480 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:16:35.070 --> 05:16:35.080 align:start position:0%
if if I could ask Mr Boyd were were you
 
05:16:38.230 --> 05:16:38.240 align:start position:0%
involved in the negotiation of the
 
05:16:41.430 --> 05:16:41.440 align:start position:0%
contract with the fiveyear limitation no
 
05:16:43.948 --> 05:16:43.958 align:start position:0%
I was not that MVD is a separate utility
 
05:16:45.070 --> 05:16:45.080 align:start position:0%
from the town of
 
05:16:47.230 --> 05:16:47.240 align:start position:0%
meramac and it was it was under their
 
05:16:49.350 --> 05:16:49.360 align:start position:0%

05:16:51.990 --> 05:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
negotiated thank you you're

05:17:44.990 --> 05:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
um with that experience I ran for and
 
05:17:47.948 --> 05:17:47.958 align:start position:0%
was elected to uh the Board of
 
05:17:51.030 --> 05:17:51.040 align:start position:0%
Commissioners at MBD in March of
 
05:17:53.948 --> 05:17:53.958 align:start position:0%
2018 and I've been chair for that um
 
05:17:56.628 --> 05:17:56.638 align:start position:0%
commission for the last two years I've
 
05:17:58.310 --> 05:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
become intimately familiar with the
 
05:18:00.310 --> 05:18:00.320 align:start position:0%
history of nbd's involvement with st
 
05:18:02.190 --> 05:18:02.200 align:start position:0%
gobain and the settlement agreement at

Wells 4
 
05:18:06.070 --> 05:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
and5 however despite that I am here
 
05:18:09.230 --> 05:18:09.240 align:start position:0%
today to explain that MBD will have a
 
05:18:11.628 --> 05:18:11.638 align:start position:0%
notable absence in today's
 
05:18:13.868 --> 05:18:13.878 align:start position:0%
participation and that's not due to a
 
05:18:15.948 --> 05:18:15.958 align:start position:0%
lack of interest but is due to advice
 
05:18:19.070 --> 05:18:19.080 align:start position:0%
from our legal councel to not proceed or
 
05:18:22.750 --> 05:18:22.760 align:start position:0%
provide testimony today uh in an effort
 
05:18:25.470 --> 05:18:25.480 align:start position:0%
to avoid potential legal retribution by
 
05:18:29.270 --> 05:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
SLE ban for doing so um I do trust that
 
05:18:30.910 --> 05:18:30.920 align:start position:0%
this committee will listen carefully and
 
05:18:32.990 --> 05:18:33.000 align:start position:0%
consider all testimony presented from
 
05:18:33.000 --> 05:18:33.830 align:start position:0%

Committee at legislative state. n.
 
05:19:11.628 --> 05:19:11.638 align:start position:0%

05:19:14.430 --> 05:19:14.440 align:start position:0%
available um I do need to make sure that
 
05:19:17.910 --> 05:19:17.920 align:start position:0%
I stay to just the um facts as I know
 
05:19:20.590 --> 05:19:20.600 align:start position:0%
them to exist uh and I just wanted to
 
05:19:23.510 --> 05:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
make it clear that I'm here um for the
 
05:19:27.070 --> 05:19:27.080 align:start position:0%
for that purpose thank you are there any
 
05:19:28.590 --> 05:19:28.600 align:start position:0%
questions from Mr
 
05:19:32.390 --> 05:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
preventure yes representative walper
 
05:19:39.470 --> 05:19:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:42.670 --> 05:19:42.680 align:start position:0%
about I wasn't sure if I heard that all
 
05:19:42.680 --> 05:19:43.470 align:start position:0%
about I wasn't sure if I heard that all
quite

05:19:43.470 --> 05:19:43.480 align:start position:0%
quite
 
05:19:46.590 --> 05:19:46.600 align:start position:0%
clearly I I think representative W was
 
05:19:49.190 --> 05:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
asking what organization specifically
 
05:19:53.750 --> 05:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
that you are associated with yes so I am
 
05:19:55.750 --> 05:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
with uh I am the chair of the Board of
 
05:19:57.788 --> 05:19:57.798 align:start position:0%
Commissioners of the meramac village
 
05:20:01.470 --> 05:20:01.480 align:start position:0%
District that's MVD um MVD is the one
 
05:20:04.270 --> 05:20:04.280 align:start position:0%
who negotiated the settlement agreement
 
05:20:07.708 --> 05:20:07.718 align:start position:0%
with st gobain uh and that was prior to
 
05:20:09.628 --> 05:20:09.638 align:start position:0%
my involvement with the board again I
 
05:20:13.310 --> 05:20:13.320 align:start position:0%
was elected in March of 2018 and a
 
05:20:15.470 --> 05:20:15.480 align:start position:0%
matter of fact the the night that I was
 
05:20:16.830 --> 05:20:16.840 align:start position:0%
elected was the night that the
 
05:20:19.430 --> 05:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
settlement agreement was announced by
 
05:20:22.230 --> 05:20:22.240 align:start position:0%
the previous board members at the annual
 
05:20:28.510 --> 05:20:28.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:32.270 --> 05:20:32.280 align:start position:0%
MVD yes representative p
 
05:20:35.350 --> 05:20:35.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um I'm going to
 
05:20:36.350 --> 05:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
sound like
 
05:20:40.548 --> 05:20:40.558 align:start position:0%
a broken horse or whatever but uh Mr
 
05:20:42.390 --> 05:20:42.400 align:start position:0%
prent to the extent you can answer this
 
05:20:45.230 --> 05:20:45.240 align:start position:0%
question is there anything that you know
 
05:20:50.470 --> 05:20:50.480 align:start position:0%
now that you know St gobain knew that
 
05:20:51.990 --> 05:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
the folks who entered the settlement
 
05:20:55.190 --> 05:20:55.200 align:start position:0%
agreement on the TW 2018
 
05:20:58.350 --> 05:20:58.360 align:start position:0%
date uh would have known would have
 
05:20:59.948 --> 05:20:59.958 align:start position:0%
changed their mind had they known what
 
05:21:02.070 --> 05:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
St gobain know
 
05:21:04.910 --> 05:21:04.920 align:start position:0%
new so did you follow that and if you
 
05:21:07.270 --> 05:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
can't answer for whatever reason but I
 
05:21:10.750 --> 05:21:10.760 align:start position:0%
apologize I I yes thank I I I do
 
05:21:12.548 --> 05:21:12.558 align:start position:0%
understand uh representative Paige
 
05:21:16.270 --> 05:21:16.280 align:start position:0%
thanks for that question um I think the
 
05:21:19.708 --> 05:21:19.718 align:start position:0%
the best answer I can provide is that um
 
05:21:22.110 --> 05:21:22.120 align:start position:0%
I can relay a site visit that MVD
 
05:21:24.350 --> 05:21:24.360 align:start position:0%
attended in HK
 
05:21:27.830 --> 05:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
Falls um knowing that HK Falls was
 
05:21:30.030 --> 05:21:30.040 align:start position:0%
building a granular activated carbon
 
05:21:32.110 --> 05:21:32.120 align:start position:0%
treatment plant
 
05:21:35.548 --> 05:21:35.558 align:start position:0%
um and they were involved in a similar
 
05:21:38.510 --> 05:21:38.520 align:start position:0%
contamination uh situation in HK Falls
 
05:21:43.350 --> 05:21:43.360 align:start position:0%
New York um some uh members of MVD staff
 
05:21:46.510 --> 05:21:46.520 align:start position:0%
as well as our Consulting Engineers made
 
05:21:50.910 --> 05:21:50.920 align:start position:0%
a visit uh over to HK Falls to speak
 
05:21:53.430 --> 05:21:53.440 align:start position:0%
with the operators of that treatment
 
05:21:55.590 --> 05:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
plant uh there there was a treatment
 
05:22:00.030 --> 05:22:00.040 align:start position:0%
plant built um out there for uh the same
 
05:22:02.470 --> 05:22:02.480 align:start position:0%
contamination as are experiencing so we
 
05:22:04.990 --> 05:22:05.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to get some insight and when we
 
05:22:08.788 --> 05:22:08.798 align:start position:0%
were at that um visit we asked the
 
05:22:11.070 --> 05:22:11.080 align:start position:0%
representatives The Operators there that
 
05:22:13.110 --> 05:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
were in the treatment plant some
 
05:22:17.110 --> 05:22:17.120 align:start position:0%
questions about um what the cost is and
 
05:22:20.510 --> 05:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
how frequently the media is changed and
 
05:22:22.830 --> 05:22:22.840 align:start position:0%
their answer to us was that they didn't
 
05:22:25.390 --> 05:22:25.400 align:start position:0%
have a lot of information specifically
 
05:22:28.150 --> 05:22:28.160 align:start position:0%
because they actually didn't do the
 
05:22:31.230 --> 05:22:31.240 align:start position:0%
filter change outs of the media that was
 
05:22:34.948 --> 05:22:34.958 align:start position:0%
all done by St goban and St go Bain's
 
05:22:38.548 --> 05:22:38.558 align:start position:0%
staff and everybody from MVD looked at
 
05:22:41.110 --> 05:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
each other in astonishment because
 
05:22:45.070 --> 05:22:45.080 align:start position:0%
nobody was aware that that was the case
 
05:22:48.230 --> 05:22:48.240 align:start position:0%
um so upon further
 
05:22:50.590 --> 05:22:50.600 align:start position:0%
questions uh and subsequently we had
 
05:22:54.350 --> 05:22:54.360 align:start position:0%
this verified by our own uh legal staff
 
05:22:57.708 --> 05:22:57.718 align:start position:0%
at the time uh we subsequently found out
 
05:23:00.948 --> 05:23:00.958 align:start position:0%
that St gobain had been changing out the
 
05:23:04.788 --> 05:23:04.798 align:start position:0%
media filters on their own cost as soon
 
05:23:07.510 --> 05:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
as the first breakthrough of the first
 
05:23:07.520 --> 05:23:08.750 align:start position:0%
as the first breakthrough of the first
past

05:23:08.750 --> 05:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
past
 
05:23:11.310 --> 05:23:11.320 align:start position:0%
compound um came through the
 
05:23:14.788 --> 05:23:14.798 align:start position:0%
filters and that astonished look on the
 
05:23:18.270 --> 05:23:18.280 align:start position:0%
face of the some of the members of MBD
 
05:23:22.230 --> 05:23:22.240 align:start position:0%
who were present in part of that um
 
05:23:24.190 --> 05:23:24.200 align:start position:0%
settlement agreement it that was a
 
05:23:27.868 --> 05:23:27.878 align:start position:0%
complete surprise to them so I think
 
05:23:29.150 --> 05:23:29.160 align:start position:0%
that that
 
05:23:32.830 --> 05:23:32.840 align:start position:0%
surprise um that they are paying in HK
 
05:23:37.110 --> 05:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
falls for the change out of that um
 
05:23:40.150 --> 05:23:40.160 align:start position:0%
carbon filter media and have been paying
 
05:23:42.470 --> 05:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
for that since we have since found out
 
05:23:44.110 --> 05:23:44.120 align:start position:0%
since that went
 
05:23:48.070 --> 05:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
online um in 2016 is a material
 
05:23:50.150 --> 05:23:50.160 align:start position:0%
difference from what our settlement
 
05:23:52.070 --> 05:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
agreement provides with only five years
 
05:23:53.590 --> 05:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
of operation and
 
05:23:55.708 --> 05:23:55.718 align:start position:0%
maintenance so that's one of the big
 
05:23:57.948 --> 05:23:57.958 align:start position:0%
that's one of the big um unknowns that
 
05:24:00.390 --> 05:24:00.400 align:start position:0%
we didn't know at the time apparently
 
05:24:01.670 --> 05:24:01.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:24:01.680 --> 05:24:03.150 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

05:24:03.150 --> 05:24:03.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:24:05.190 --> 05:24:05.200 align:start position:0%
syvia thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
05:24:07.548 --> 05:24:07.558 align:start position:0%
you for taking my questions uh just
 
05:24:10.470 --> 05:24:10.480 align:start position:0%
question just one uh are all aspects of
 
05:24:13.310 --> 05:24:13.320 align:start position:0%
the settle settlement agreement
 
05:24:16.030 --> 05:24:16.040 align:start position:0%
public yes absolutely that's all public
 
05:24:18.350 --> 05:24:18.360 align:start position:0%
information and we can send that to
 
05:24:22.390 --> 05:24:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:28.350 --> 05:24:28.360 align:start position:0%
you are there any other questions for Mr
 
05:24:31.070 --> 05:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
proventure I get I guess the the the
 
05:24:33.628 --> 05:24:33.638 align:start position:0%
question I have is sort of a followup to
 
05:24:37.470 --> 05:24:37.480 align:start position:0%
representative PA's question and and
 
05:24:39.788 --> 05:24:39.798 align:start position:0%
that is if you've entered into an
 
05:24:41.110 --> 05:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
agreement you've entered into a
 
05:24:43.230 --> 05:24:43.240 align:start position:0%
settlement agreement with st
 
05:24:47.110 --> 05:24:47.120 align:start position:0%
gbang and there are reasons why that
 
05:24:49.190 --> 05:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
agreement could be nullified I think
 
05:24:50.868 --> 05:24:50.878 align:start position:0%
representative Paige was sort of getting
 
05:24:52.868 --> 05:24:52.878 align:start position:0%
there if there was a mutual mistake or
 
05:24:54.190 --> 05:24:54.200 align:start position:0%
some type of
 
05:24:58.310 --> 05:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
fraud U and and that might be a reason
 
05:25:00.110 --> 05:25:00.120 align:start position:0%
for doing that and I'm presuming that
 
05:25:02.830 --> 05:25:02.840 align:start position:0%
that might be one reason
 
05:25:07.510 --> 05:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
why MBD is is not being forthcoming
 
05:25:09.150 --> 05:25:09.160 align:start position:0%
because they have their own legal
 
05:25:11.590 --> 05:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
strategy as to how they're handling that
 
05:25:15.548 --> 05:25:15.558 align:start position:0%
and why why wouldn't we in considering
 
05:25:20.510 --> 05:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
this bill wait to see if there is some
 
05:25:23.270 --> 05:25:23.280 align:start position:0%
legal challenge to the validity of
 
05:25:25.788 --> 05:25:25.798 align:start position:0%
agreement as opposed to taking some type
 
05:25:29.110 --> 05:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:31.788 --> 05:25:31.798 align:start position:0%
action uh I think the best way to answer
 
05:25:36.470 --> 05:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
that is to um describe to you um the
 
05:25:39.590 --> 05:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
outcome of a a meeting that was held at
 
05:25:43.310 --> 05:25:43.320 align:start position:0%
the meramac Town Hall in November of
 
05:25:47.548 --> 05:25:47.558 align:start position:0%
2019 um at that time um the late speaker
 
05:25:51.990 --> 05:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
Dick hinch had requested a meeting um
 
05:25:54.110 --> 05:25:54.120 align:start position:0%
upon my request there was a bunch of
 
05:25:56.470 --> 05:25:56.480 align:start position:0%
questions that I had had regarding the
 
05:26:00.670 --> 05:26:00.680 align:start position:0%
settlement agreement and um uh the late
 
05:26:05.270 --> 05:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
speaker hinch had um called a meeting
 
05:26:07.230 --> 05:26:07.240 align:start position:0%
with the governor the dees and the
 
05:26:10.470 --> 05:26:10.480 align:start position:0%
Attorney General at the Town Hall in
 
05:26:13.030 --> 05:26:13.040 align:start position:0%
November of 2019 and at that meeting
 
05:26:14.990 --> 05:26:15.000 align:start position:0%
there were representatives from the Town
 
05:26:18.150 --> 05:26:18.160 align:start position:0%
Council the MVD was there and some
 
05:26:20.590 --> 05:26:20.600 align:start position:0%
representatives from meramac were in
 
05:26:23.670 --> 05:26:23.680 align:start position:0%
attendance um the question was asked
 
05:26:29.948 --> 05:26:29.958 align:start position:0%
about why did Dees not follow through on
 
05:26:32.070 --> 05:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
their April 1st
 
05:26:36.670 --> 05:26:36.680 align:start position:0%
2016 letter which uh requested that St
 
05:26:40.910 --> 05:26:40.920 align:start position:0%
Goan provide treatment and and pay for
 
05:26:40.920 --> 05:26:41.670 align:start position:0%
Goan provide treatment and and pay for
that

05:26:41.670 --> 05:26:41.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:26:44.390 --> 05:26:44.400 align:start position:0%
treatment um for all public water
 
05:26:50.270 --> 05:26:50.280 align:start position:0%
supplies affected which was affecting um
 
05:26:53.670 --> 05:26:53.680 align:start position:0%
MVD um and why did why did they not
 
05:26:56.030 --> 05:26:56.040 align:start position:0%
enforce that letter and basically we
 
05:27:00.270 --> 05:27:00.280 align:start position:0%
were told at that time that um Dees did
 
05:27:02.350 --> 05:27:02.360 align:start position:0%
not have
 
05:27:06.548 --> 05:27:06.558 align:start position:0%
authorization to enforce that letter
 
05:27:09.070 --> 05:27:09.080 align:start position:0%
because they cannot negotiate on behalf
 
05:27:12.110 --> 05:27:12.120 align:start position:0%
of a private entity well MVD is still
 
05:27:14.150 --> 05:27:14.160 align:start position:0%
considered a a public
 
05:27:17.590 --> 05:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
entity um and basically under the
 
05:27:19.548 --> 05:27:19.558 align:start position:0%
provisions of RSA
 
05:27:23.510 --> 05:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
485 We Believe Dees does have authority
 
05:27:26.990 --> 05:27:27.000 align:start position:0%
to have to enforce that April 1 letter
 
05:27:28.190 --> 05:27:28.200 align:start position:0%
uh but at that meeting we were
 
05:27:30.510 --> 05:27:30.520 align:start position:0%
essentially told by the dees that there
 
05:27:32.310 --> 05:27:32.320 align:start position:0%
there's nothing more that Dees is going
 
05:27:36.510 --> 05:27:36.520 align:start position:0%
to do for MVD in this matter and that we
 
05:27:38.830 --> 05:27:38.840 align:start position:0%
were pretty much left on our own from
 
05:27:40.070 --> 05:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
that point
 
05:27:40.080 --> 05:27:41.788 align:start position:0%
that point
forward

05:27:41.788 --> 05:27:41.798 align:start position:0%
forward
 
05:27:45.270 --> 05:27:45.280 align:start position:0%
um so that's that's that's kind of the
 
05:27:47.670 --> 05:27:47.680 align:start position:0%
the the answer to my question
 
05:27:50.910 --> 05:27:50.920 align:start position:0%
basically any other questions for Mr
 
05:27:53.030 --> 05:27:53.040 align:start position:0%
preventure see none thank you for your
 
05:27:56.628 --> 05:27:56.638 align:start position:0%
testimony today thank
 
05:27:59.430 --> 05:27:59.440 align:start position:0%
you we have David
 
05:27:59.440 --> 05:28:14.350 align:start position:0%
you we have David
Ker

05:28:14.350 --> 05:28:14.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:16.190 --> 05:28:16.200 align:start position:0%
there it is thank you all for having me
 
05:28:18.590 --> 05:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
here uh my name is David career I am
 
05:28:20.310 --> 05:28:20.320 align:start position:0%
director of public policy for the
 
05:28:22.150 --> 05:28:22.160 align:start position:0%
business and industry Association of New
 
05:28:24.948 --> 05:28:24.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm here to uh speak in
 
05:28:27.430 --> 05:28:27.440 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill uh because it is
 
05:28:29.670 --> 05:28:29.680 align:start position:0%
bad public policy to alter these types
 
05:28:32.670 --> 05:28:32.680 align:start position:0%
of agreements after the fact um this
 
05:28:35.390 --> 05:28:35.400 align:start position:0%
sends a signal to businesses that New
 
05:28:37.628 --> 05:28:37.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is not a business-friendly
 
05:28:39.830 --> 05:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
place um and what's going to end up
 
05:28:42.270 --> 05:28:42.280 align:start position:0%
happening is that businesses will be
 
05:28:44.868 --> 05:28:44.878 align:start position:0%
less likely to cooperate in
 
05:28:47.868 --> 05:28:47.878 align:start position:0%
negotiations if they uh you know feel
 
05:28:50.110 --> 05:28:50.120 align:start position:0%
that if the outcome of the negotiation
 
05:28:53.548 --> 05:28:53.558 align:start position:0%
doesn't um go as far as you know the
 
05:28:55.390 --> 05:28:55.400 align:start position:0%
town people wanted while they're just
 
05:28:57.430 --> 05:28:57.440 align:start position:0%
going to legislate a new negotiation or
 
05:28:59.990 --> 05:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
a new agreement uh with that business so
 
05:29:02.670 --> 05:29:02.680 align:start position:0%
the less likely to uh cooperate in those
 
05:29:05.310 --> 05:29:05.320 align:start position:0%
negotiations and will end up uh you know
 
05:29:07.510 --> 05:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
litigating cases fully which will only
 
05:29:11.350 --> 05:29:11.360 align:start position:0%
delay any remediation uh for you know
 
05:29:14.590 --> 05:29:14.600 align:start position:0%
towns and situations like this um also
 
05:29:16.430 --> 05:29:16.440 align:start position:0%
this will because it's sending that
 
05:29:19.230 --> 05:29:19.240 align:start position:0%
signal of being a um nonb
 
05:29:21.270 --> 05:29:21.280 align:start position:0%
business-friendly State uh businesses
 
05:29:23.150 --> 05:29:23.160 align:start position:0%
will start to look elsewhere to either
 
05:29:25.670 --> 05:29:25.680 align:start position:0%
expand or move their business uh which
 
05:29:27.750 --> 05:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
can have serious detrimental effects on
 
05:29:30.670 --> 05:29:30.680 align:start position:0%
our economy uh happy to answer answer
 
05:29:33.990 --> 05:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
any questions that you may have there
 
05:29:36.910 --> 05:29:36.920 align:start position:0%
any questions for
 
05:29:40.230 --> 05:29:40.240 align:start position:0%
Mr represent mlan good thank you Mr
 
05:29:41.430 --> 05:29:41.440 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
05:29:43.948 --> 05:29:43.958 align:start position:0%
question so one of the one of the things
 
05:29:46.270 --> 05:29:46.280 align:start position:0%
that was discussed is they're getting a
 
05:29:49.470 --> 05:29:49.480 align:start position:0%
lot of feedback from Dees the dees felt
 
05:29:51.868 --> 05:29:51.878 align:start position:0%
that they they did not have the
 
05:29:55.230 --> 05:29:55.240 align:start position:0%
authority to enforce elements of of the
 
05:29:58.070 --> 05:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
agreement if I understand that correctly
 
05:30:01.708 --> 05:30:01.718 align:start position:0%
so um would the Bia be open to going
 
05:30:04.270 --> 05:30:04.280 align:start position:0%
back rather than having a specific car
 
05:30:06.750 --> 05:30:06.760 align:start position:0%
out of this specific settlement to look
 
05:30:10.310 --> 05:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
at are there areas that are maybe murky
 
05:30:12.548 --> 05:30:12.558 align:start position:0%
that need to be clarified and look at
 
05:30:14.270 --> 05:30:14.280 align:start position:0%
that is that something you'd be willing
 
05:30:17.470 --> 05:30:17.480 align:start position:0%
to look at in terms of the the agreement
 
05:30:19.670 --> 05:30:19.680 align:start position:0%
you mean going back and look at that you
 
05:30:22.190 --> 05:30:22.200 align:start position:0%
know in in terms of on a broader scale
 
05:30:24.510 --> 05:30:24.520 align:start position:0%
just looking at those areas of the law
 
05:30:27.430 --> 05:30:27.440 align:start position:0%
where Dees feels they're hamstrung and
 
05:30:30.390 --> 05:30:30.400 align:start position:0%
don't have the ability to act oh okay I
 
05:30:33.150 --> 05:30:33.160 align:start position:0%
see um well without seeing any language
 
05:30:35.310 --> 05:30:35.320 align:start position:0%
you know it'd be hard for me to take any
 
05:30:38.510 --> 05:30:38.520 align:start position:0%
specific position on a bill like that um
 
05:30:41.030 --> 05:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
you know Bia has a pretty extensive
 
05:30:45.430 --> 05:30:45.440 align:start position:0%
policy uh policy decision process uh
 
05:30:46.990 --> 05:30:47.000 align:start position:0%
where we you know speak with our members
 
05:30:49.390 --> 05:30:49.400 align:start position:0%
and we have committees um and hold
 
05:30:51.310 --> 05:30:51.320 align:start position:0%
roundtables and and you know it's a
 
05:30:54.350 --> 05:30:54.360 align:start position:0%
pretty extensive process of uh making
 
05:30:56.868 --> 05:30:56.878 align:start position:0%
these policy decisions so unfortunately
 
05:30:59.310 --> 05:30:59.320 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't be able to you know commit
 
05:31:00.628 --> 05:31:00.638 align:start position:0%
one way or another with without seeing
 
05:31:02.350 --> 05:31:02.360 align:start position:0%
any specific language and and running it
 
05:31:03.590 --> 05:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
through that
 
05:31:06.470 --> 05:31:06.480 align:start position:0%
process thank you any other questions
 
05:31:06.480 --> 05:31:08.030 align:start position:0%
process thank you any other questions
for

05:31:08.030 --> 05:31:08.040 align:start position:0%

marac I'm here to voice my support for
 
05:31:57.150 --> 05:31:57.160 align:start position:0%
HB 478 and to respectfully request your
 
05:31:59.590 --> 05:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
support as well um this bill is not only
 
05:32:00.948 --> 05:32:00.958 align:start position:0%
important to those of us in the town of
 
05:32:03.110 --> 05:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
marac served by the our local Municipal
 
05:32:05.150 --> 05:32:05.160 align:start position:0%
Water Supply system the marac Doge
 
05:32:07.270 --> 05:32:07.280 align:start position:0%
District but to MVD rate payers in
 
05:32:09.510 --> 05:32:09.520 align:start position:0%
Bedford as well to better understand why
 
05:32:11.030 --> 05:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
there's no need for a legislative
 
05:32:12.788 --> 05:32:12.798 align:start position:0%
solution it's important to know a bit of
 
05:32:14.750 --> 05:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
the history that has made this bill
 
05:32:17.948 --> 05:32:17.958 align:start position:0%
necessary um as you know in early 2016
 
05:32:20.190 --> 05:32:20.200 align:start position:0%
the marac community um with a population
 
05:32:22.628 --> 05:32:22.638 align:start position:0%
of around 27,000 residents was first
 
05:32:24.788 --> 05:32:24.798 align:start position:0%
informed that our public drinking water
 
05:32:27.150 --> 05:32:27.160 align:start position:0%
was contaminated by pest many private
 
05:32:29.190 --> 05:32:29.200 align:start position:0%
Wells were found to be contaminated as
 
05:32:32.350 --> 05:32:32.360 align:start position:0%
well Dees identified St gobain as the
 
05:32:34.750 --> 05:32:34.760 align:start position:0%
polluter manufacturing processes that
 
05:32:37.350 --> 05:32:37.360 align:start position:0%
led to pasas releases via a deposition
 
05:32:39.830 --> 05:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
and other pest discharges from the St
 
05:32:42.030 --> 05:32:42.040 align:start position:0%

assistant commissioner clar frzy shared
 
05:32:48.990 --> 05:32:49.000 align:start position:0%
that the extent of this Southern New
 
05:32:51.230 --> 05:32:51.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire area contamination made it the
 
05:32:52.868 --> 05:32:52.878 align:start position:0%
largest environmental industrial
 
05:32:55.030 --> 05:32:55.040 align:start position:0%

05:32:56.350 --> 05:32:56.360 align:start position:0%

to the MBD as part of the dees s gobang
 
05:34:12.070 --> 05:34:12.080 align:start position:0%

pooa concentration at Wells 45 will be
 
05:34:24.150 --> 05:34:24.160 align:start position:0%
reduced to the current 12 parts per
 
05:34:26.868 --> 05:34:26.878 align:start position:0%
trillion MCL um I'd like to address the
 
05:34:29.190 --> 05:34:29.200 align:start position:0%
issue of who should be holding stco Bane
 
05:34:30.470 --> 05:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
accountable and I think this is part of
 
05:34:32.628 --> 05:34:32.638 align:start position:0%
the challenge and what has necessitated
 
05:34:32.638 --> 05:34:34.070 align:start position:0%
the challenge and what has necessitated
HB

HB
 
05:34:37.910 --> 05:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
478 um a letter dated April 1st 2016
 
05:34:40.670 --> 05:34:40.680 align:start position:0%
with the subject heading regarding pfoa
 
05:34:42.788 --> 05:34:42.798 align:start position:0%
matters in Southern New Hampshire was
 
05:34:45.628 --> 05:34:45.638 align:start position:0%
sent by Dees commissioner Thomas Buck to

York address this five-page letter
 
05:34:54.510 --> 05:34:54.520 align:start position:0%
references quote a number of critical
 
05:34:57.150 --> 05:34:57.160 align:start position:0%
steps that need to be taken immediately
 
05:34:59.110 --> 05:34:59.120 align:start position:0%
to address the threats to Public Health
 
05:35:01.070 --> 05:35:01.080 align:start position:0%
and the environment imposed by PFC
 
05:35:03.390 --> 05:35:03.400 align:start position:0%
contamination and provided a three-page
 
05:35:06.030 --> 05:35:06.040 align:start position:0%
list documenting actions that needed to
 
05:35:09.788 --> 05:35:09.798 align:start position:0%
be taken by Sinco Bain DS uh Dees made
 
05:35:11.548 --> 05:35:11.558 align:start position:0%
it clear in that letter that had an
 
05:35:13.670 --> 05:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
expectation of prompt cooperation by Z
 
05:35:16.150 --> 05:35:16.160 align:start position:0%
gobain in addition to site remediation
 
05:35:18.590 --> 05:35:18.600 align:start position:0%
on page three the section most important
 
05:35:21.270 --> 05:35:21.280 align:start position:0%
and relevant to this legislation appears
 
05:35:24.150 --> 05:35:24.160 align:start position:0%
as it say cites the steps at St Goan
 
05:35:26.510 --> 05:35:26.520 align:start position:0%
needs to take relative to public water
 
05:35:29.150 --> 05:35:29.160 align:start position:0%
supply treatment it specifically lists
 
05:35:31.590 --> 05:35:31.600 align:start position:0%
the design installation operation and
 
05:35:33.670 --> 05:35:33.680 align:start position:0%
monitoring of all water treatment
 
05:35:35.910 --> 05:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
systems necessary to effectively treat
 
05:35:37.628 --> 05:35:37.638 align:start position:0%
and remove PFC
 
05:35:39.830 --> 05:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
contamination from all affected water
 
05:35:42.910 --> 05:35:42.920 align:start position:0%
systems and that St gobain will quote
 
05:35:45.230 --> 05:35:45.240 align:start position:0%
provide for the necessary long-term
 
05:35:47.110 --> 05:35:47.120 align:start position:0%
operation maintenance and monitoring of
 
05:35:48.788 --> 05:35:48.798 align:start position:0%
the installed treatment
 
05:35:51.190 --> 05:35:51.200 align:start position:0%
systems though Dees had issued this
 
05:35:54.390 --> 05:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
April 1st 2016 letter to CCO Bain it did
 
05:35:57.310 --> 05:35:57.320 align:start position:0%
not nor did the AG take action to issue
 
05:35:59.030 --> 05:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
a consent order against anco ban
 
05:36:00.548 --> 05:36:00.558 align:start position:0%
regarding contam mintion of Marin
 
05:36:02.910 --> 05:36:02.920 align:start position:0%
Village District Wells 4 and five the
 
05:36:04.830 --> 05:36:04.840 align:start position:0%
expectation that St gobain provide the
 
05:36:07.030 --> 05:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
aforementioned long-term operation
 
05:36:08.548 --> 05:36:08.558 align:start position:0%
maintenance and monitoring reference
 
05:36:12.230 --> 05:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
within the letter though stated was not
 
05:36:14.390 --> 05:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
enforced that's what made it necessary
 
05:36:16.310 --> 05:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
for the MVD to negotiate its own
 
05:36:18.230 --> 05:36:18.240 align:start position:0%
settlement agreement with st Cain
 
05:36:20.510 --> 05:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
without Dees or the Attorney General's
 
05:36:21.910 --> 05:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
assistance and I just wanted to I know a
 
05:36:23.830 --> 05:36:23.840 align:start position:0%
couple of comments came up about who was
 
05:36:25.868 --> 05:36:25.878 align:start position:0%
involved and um I think it should be
 
05:36:29.110 --> 05:36:29.120 align:start position:0%
noted that there was no um uh Community
 
05:36:31.510 --> 05:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
involvement there was no input sought
 
05:36:34.230 --> 05:36:34.240 align:start position:0%
from community members who were aware
 
05:36:37.070 --> 05:36:37.080 align:start position:0%
and were concerned about this issue um
 
05:36:39.070 --> 05:36:39.080 align:start position:0%
that was a pro an agreement that was
 
05:36:41.510 --> 05:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
made by a former group of uh elected
 
05:36:44.150 --> 05:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
officials to the MVD um it's interesting
 
05:36:46.868 --> 05:36:46.878 align:start position:0%
to note that a very similar scenario had
 
05:36:49.150 --> 05:36:49.160 align:start position:0%
played out with Senco Bank contaminating
 
05:36:51.110 --> 05:36:51.120 align:start position:0%
uh our our MVD public drinking water
 
05:36:53.628 --> 05:36:53.638 align:start position:0%
well had occurred in New York just two
 
05:36:56.628 --> 05:36:56.638 align:start position:0%

05:37:06.310 --> 05:37:06.320 align:start position:0%
subsequent aerial groundwater
 
05:37:08.830 --> 05:37:08.840 align:start position:0%
contaminated contamination resulted just
 
05:37:11.990 --> 05:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
as it did in March similar situation
 
05:37:14.190 --> 05:37:14.200 align:start position:0%
same polluter but what happened next is
 
05:37:16.470 --> 05:37:16.480 align:start position:0%
quite different our state's response was
 
05:37:18.788 --> 05:37:18.798 align:start position:0%
different which led to the need for HB
 
05:37:22.310 --> 05:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
478 now in January 2016 New York's
 
05:37:23.708 --> 05:37:23.718 align:start position:0%
Governor announced an emergency
 
05:37:26.430 --> 05:37:26.440 align:start position:0%
regulation to classify pfoa as a
 
05:37:28.670 --> 05:37:28.680 align:start position:0%
hazardous substance and the S gobain
 
05:37:31.510 --> 05:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
mcaffrey plant as a state superf fund
 
05:37:33.628 --> 05:37:33.638 align:start position:0%
site New York's Department of
 
05:37:36.548 --> 05:37:36.558 align:start position:0%
Environmental Conservation or de issued
 
05:37:38.628 --> 05:37:38.638 align:start position:0%
an order of consent and administrative
 
05:37:41.390 --> 05:37:41.400 align:start position:0%
settlement which was signed in June 2016
 
05:37:43.230 --> 05:37:43.240 align:start position:0%
naming s gobain and honwell as
 
05:37:46.350 --> 05:37:46.360 align:start position:0%
respondents and mandating that St go
 
05:37:48.270 --> 05:37:48.280 align:start position:0%
gobain there comply with what is being
 
05:37:50.470 --> 05:37:50.480 align:start position:0%
asked here within
 
05:37:53.590 --> 05:37:53.600 align:start position:0%
478 um DEC required that St gobain
 
05:37:55.750 --> 05:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
provide uh design construction and
 
05:37:57.590 --> 05:37:57.600 align:start position:0%
maintenance of pel filtration for the
 
05:38:00.150 --> 05:38:00.160 align:start position:0%
village there and it was to be online by
 
05:38:03.350 --> 05:38:03.360 align:start position:0%
uh June excuse me by December 2016 and
 
05:38:05.190 --> 05:38:05.200 align:start position:0%
to pay for the long-term operation
 
05:38:07.708 --> 05:38:07.718 align:start position:0%
maintenance and monitoring of those PS
 
05:38:11.270 --> 05:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
filters uh this was all within months of
 
05:38:13.190 --> 05:38:13.200 align:start position:0%
um us finding out about uh our
 
05:38:13.200 --> 05:38:15.270 align:start position:0%
um us finding out about uh our
contamination

05:38:15.270 --> 05:38:15.280 align:start position:0%
contamination
 
05:38:19.070 --> 05:38:19.080 align:start position:0%
here pardon we have much more um oh
 
05:38:22.548 --> 05:38:22.558 align:start position:0%
golly just maybe maybe another minute if
 
05:38:24.470 --> 05:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
you're yeah and if you're reading it we
 
05:38:26.788 --> 05:38:26.798 align:start position:0%
can can read your testimony going to
 
05:38:28.390 --> 05:38:28.400 align:start position:0%
submit your testimony what we really
 
05:38:31.750 --> 05:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
need to do is hear from you individually
 
05:38:33.830 --> 05:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
yeah um okay I I'll I'll try to finish
 
05:38:36.788 --> 05:38:36.798 align:start position:0%
up uh we understand here in marac that
 
05:38:39.910 --> 05:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
we're not New York but given the the
 
05:38:41.910 --> 05:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
consent letter there and the the
 
05:38:44.750 --> 05:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner's letter here made the same
 
05:38:47.150 --> 05:38:47.160 align:start position:0%
expectations of the same polluter for
 
05:38:49.468 --> 05:38:49.478 align:start position:0%
doing the same thing to the public water
 
05:38:51.430 --> 05:38:51.440 align:start position:0%
supplies of our their host towns we
 
05:38:53.788 --> 05:38:53.798 align:start position:0%
would have hoped for a a more similar
 
05:38:56.868 --> 05:38:56.878 align:start position:0%
State uh response and have had a similar
 
05:39:00.190 --> 05:39:00.200 align:start position:0%
outcome um the
 
05:39:03.670 --> 05:39:03.680 align:start position:0%
the challenges B uh that Dees has seemed
 
05:39:05.270 --> 05:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
to believe that they haven't had the
 
05:39:09.910 --> 05:39:09.920 align:start position:0%
ability to um act as we would have hoped
 
05:39:14.590 --> 05:39:14.600 align:start position:0%
they would be able to um and the concern
 
05:39:17.070 --> 05:39:17.080 align:start position:0%
is if Dees doesn't have that Authority
 
05:39:18.590 --> 05:39:18.600 align:start position:0%
then you know I would certainly suggest
 
05:39:21.350 --> 05:39:21.360 align:start position:0%
that it needs it um that this is making
 
05:39:22.990 --> 05:39:23.000 align:start position:0%
their job difficult as well as the
 
05:39:25.788 --> 05:39:25.798 align:start position:0%
experience of p uh P impacted citizens
 
05:39:31.030 --> 05:39:31.040 align:start position:0%
and communities uh here um I I I'm I'm
 
05:39:34.468 --> 05:39:34.478 align:start position:0%
hoping that that a legislative response
 
05:39:37.510 --> 05:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
will um negate the the need for further
 
05:39:40.910 --> 05:39:40.920 align:start position:0%
litigation we're five years into this um
 
05:39:43.230 --> 05:39:43.240 align:start position:0%
the uh as as people have spoken before
 
05:39:46.350 --> 05:39:46.360 align:start position:0%
me have suggested um this PS
 
05:39:49.310 --> 05:39:49.320 align:start position:0%
contamination is causing costing us more
 
05:39:51.948 --> 05:39:51.958 align:start position:0%
than just money uh Health impacts and
 
05:39:54.390 --> 05:39:54.400 align:start position:0%
we're paying for contaminated water to
 
05:39:56.990 --> 05:39:57.000 align:start position:0%
come through our faucets as well as uh
 
05:39:59.030 --> 05:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
trying to purchase filtration systems
 
05:40:02.628 --> 05:40:02.638 align:start position:0%
for our eles buying bottled water Etc um
 
05:40:04.230 --> 05:40:04.240 align:start position:0%
it's time to prioritize the protections
 
05:40:07.708 --> 05:40:07.718 align:start position:0%
of people above profits um thank you for
 
05:40:10.110 --> 05:40:10.120 align:start position:0%
your time and attention and I and I ask
 
05:40:11.948 --> 05:40:11.958 align:start position:0%

05:40:35.030 --> 05:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
hello hello okay thank you you can hear
 
05:40:36.868 --> 05:40:36.878 align:start position:0%
me thank you for the opportunity to
 
05:40:39.788 --> 05:40:39.798 align:start position:0%
provide some information again um my
 
05:40:41.270 --> 05:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
name is Keith Pratt I'm a professional
 
05:40:42.590 --> 05:40:42.600 align:start position:0%
engineer and president of Underwood
 
05:40:44.548 --> 05:40:44.558 align:start position:0%
Engineers uh we have offices in forsman
 
05:40:45.990 --> 05:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
and Conquer in fact we're just a few
 
05:40:47.788 --> 05:40:47.798 align:start position:0%
blocks away from the house um we've been
 
05:40:48.948 --> 05:40:48.958 align:start position:0%
providing water and wastewater
 
05:40:51.590 --> 05:40:51.600 align:start position:0%
engineering New Hampshire for about 40
 
05:40:53.510 --> 05:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
years and 14 of those have been in
 
05:40:56.948 --> 05:40:56.958 align:start position:0%
meramac uh we're currently designing six
 
05:40:58.270 --> 05:40:58.280 align:start position:0%
treatment plants in New Hampshire
 
05:41:00.548 --> 05:41:00.558 align:start position:0%
including the three p fast facilities in
 
05:41:04.788 --> 05:41:04.798 align:start position:0%
meramac and and a past facility in Dover
 
05:41:07.868 --> 05:41:07.878 align:start position:0%
um Underwood was involved uh with the
 
05:41:09.468 --> 05:41:09.478 align:start position:0%
planning and the design of all the
 
05:41:11.590 --> 05:41:11.600 align:start position:0%
documents related to the pfest
 
05:41:12.750 --> 05:41:12.760 align:start position:0%
facilities in
 
05:41:15.510 --> 05:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
marac I personally was present many of
 
05:41:18.310 --> 05:41:18.320 align:start position:0%
the meetings between San and and marac
 
05:41:20.030 --> 05:41:20.040 align:start position:0%
as the settlement agreement was being
 
05:41:22.788 --> 05:41:22.798 align:start position:0%
developed primarily to provide tech
 
05:41:25.590 --> 05:41:25.600 align:start position:0%
support um I was requested to be here
 
05:41:26.948 --> 05:41:26.958 align:start position:0%
because of our understanding of the
 
05:41:28.510 --> 05:41:28.520 align:start position:0%
project so I'm volunteering my time
 
05:41:30.990 --> 05:41:31.000 align:start position:0%
really to summarize the costs um of the
 
05:41:33.830 --> 05:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
facility including the omm so we were
 
05:41:36.590 --> 05:41:36.600 align:start position:0%
there and um when pest was first
 
05:41:38.430 --> 05:41:38.440 align:start position:0%
reported at Wells four and five in
 
05:41:41.190 --> 05:41:41.200 align:start position:0%
February 2016 and again you know when
 
05:41:43.868 --> 05:41:43.878 align:start position:0%
the wells were shut down that spring and
 
05:41:46.430 --> 05:41:46.440 align:start position:0%
by uh 200 by May of that year within
 
05:41:47.910 --> 05:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
three months we'd actually developed our
 
05:41:49.708 --> 05:41:49.718 align:start position:0%
first planning document to look at the
 
05:41:53.510 --> 05:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
costs and within 16 months we had uh 30%
 
05:41:56.230 --> 05:41:56.240 align:start position:0%
pfast treatment facility plant designed
 
05:41:58.030 --> 05:41:58.040 align:start position:0%
which is actually what's what's in place
 
05:42:00.430 --> 05:42:00.440 align:start position:0%
today uh but even though at that time it
 
05:42:02.468 --> 05:42:02.478 align:start position:0%
was really an emerging issue with very
 
05:42:04.628 --> 05:42:04.638 align:start position:0%
little industry knowledge it was that
 
05:42:06.910 --> 05:42:06.920 align:start position:0%
30% design that became the basis of and
 
05:42:10.310 --> 05:42:10.320 align:start position:0%
actually is attached to the agreement
 
05:42:13.788 --> 05:42:13.798 align:start position:0%
that was uh executed March of 18 and the
 
05:42:16.708 --> 05:42:16.718 align:start position:0%
cost opinions of um that were used in
 
05:42:18.670 --> 05:42:18.680 align:start position:0%
that agreement um in that report were
 
05:42:19.990 --> 05:42:20.000 align:start position:0%
were thought to be that the facility
 
05:42:22.430 --> 05:42:22.440 align:start position:0%
would cost $4.4
 
05:42:25.270 --> 05:42:25.280 align:start position:0%
million uh in September later that year
 
05:42:27.270 --> 05:42:27.280 align:start position:0%
there was a meeting held at Dees the
 
05:42:30.190 --> 05:42:30.200 align:start position:0%
request to St Cain with representatives
 
05:42:32.510 --> 05:42:32.520 align:start position:0%
from all parties and uh and the outcome
 
05:42:34.190 --> 05:42:34.200 align:start position:0%
of that meeting that the costs were
 
05:42:36.510 --> 05:42:36.520 align:start position:0%
reduced uh essentially because it was
 
05:42:38.628 --> 05:42:38.638 align:start position:0%
thought by S Bain and their experience
 
05:42:40.590 --> 05:42:40.600 align:start position:0%
at other facilities I think HK Falls
 
05:42:42.868 --> 05:42:42.878 align:start position:0%
primarily that that the costs beinged
 
05:42:45.350 --> 05:42:45.360 align:start position:0%
were too high and further during the
 
05:42:46.708 --> 05:42:46.718 align:start position:0%
settlement agreements the uh
 
05:42:51.150 --> 05:42:51.160 align:start position:0%
negotiations the S Cain had um had
 
05:42:53.868 --> 05:42:53.878 align:start position:0%
identified that of the portions 4.1 that
 
05:42:56.230 --> 05:42:56.240 align:start position:0%
were related to three fast past was
 
05:42:58.230 --> 05:42:58.240 align:start position:0%
around 3.3 million which is really Le
 
05:43:00.390 --> 05:43:00.400 align:start position:0%
about a million dollars less than the
 
05:43:02.230 --> 05:43:02.240 align:start position:0%
estimated cost to the to complete the
 
05:43:03.590 --> 05:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
facility and actually now that the
 
05:43:07.270 --> 05:43:07.280 align:start position:0%
project is is complete um the costs are
 
05:43:10.030 --> 05:43:10.040 align:start position:0%
for the capital um and design phase and
 
05:43:11.628 --> 05:43:11.638 align:start position:0%
everything else has come in right around
 
05:43:13.910 --> 05:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
4.9 million which actually doesn't
 
05:43:16.868 --> 05:43:16.878 align:start position:0%
include some of the preliminary costs um
 
05:43:19.590 --> 05:43:19.600 align:start position:0%
up to that date we had also developed
 
05:43:22.590 --> 05:43:22.600 align:start position:0%
onm cost in
 
05:43:24.990 --> 05:43:25.000 align:start position:0%
2017 uh we estimated that the facility
 
05:43:26.548 --> 05:43:26.558 align:start position:0%
would cost about
 
05:43:29.070 --> 05:43:29.080 align:start position:0%
215,000 of which about half was thought
 
05:43:30.350 --> 05:43:30.360 align:start position:0%
to be past
 
05:43:33.190 --> 05:43:33.200 align:start position:0%
related and is which which is what sank
 
05:43:36.030 --> 05:43:36.040 align:start position:0%
Bain agreed to pay only the past related
 
05:43:38.990 --> 05:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
cost and and um despite attempts to get
 
05:43:42.110 --> 05:43:42.120 align:start position:0%
more onm during the during that time the
 
05:43:44.070 --> 05:43:44.080 align:start position:0%
final agreement has been noted earlier
 
05:43:45.788 --> 05:43:45.798 align:start position:0%
that is is that they'd only pay five
 
05:43:48.590 --> 05:43:48.600 align:start position:0%
years of the uh of the P related costs
 
05:43:52.390 --> 05:43:52.400 align:start position:0%
or just over half a million uh just over
 
05:43:55.030 --> 05:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
$500,000 um and at that time we believe
 
05:43:57.628 --> 05:43:57.638 align:start position:0%
that the the carbon which is the media
 
05:44:00.070 --> 05:44:00.080 align:start position:0%
that removes the past would last two
 
05:44:02.390 --> 05:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
years um three years later now that we
 
05:44:05.708 --> 05:44:05.718 align:start position:0%
have more experience uh more knowledge
 
05:44:08.030 --> 05:44:08.040 align:start position:0%
and new regulations uh we actually
 
05:44:10.030 --> 05:44:10.040 align:start position:0%
believe that the media will be replaced
 
05:44:11.868 --> 05:44:11.878 align:start position:0%
every year and probably closer to
 
05:44:14.270 --> 05:44:14.280 align:start position:0%
potentially every six months we're also
 
05:44:15.708 --> 05:44:15.718 align:start position:0%
finding that the cost to the media is
 
05:44:18.230 --> 05:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
more expensive as well these two things
 
05:44:19.868 --> 05:44:19.878 align:start position:0%
have really significantly impacted the
 
05:44:23.070 --> 05:44:23.080 align:start position:0%
cost the onm cost uh we now believe MBD
 
05:44:25.270 --> 05:44:25.280 align:start position:0%
is facing past related onm cost for
 
05:44:28.390 --> 05:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
Wells 4 and five in the range of 100 to
 
05:44:30.030 --> 05:44:30.040 align:start position:0%
106 60 to
 
05:44:33.468 --> 05:44:33.478 align:start position:0%
$450,000 per year or 50 to 400% more
 
05:44:34.830 --> 05:44:34.840 align:start position:0%
than what we thought at the time of the
 
05:44:34.840 --> 05:44:35.788 align:start position:0%
than what we thought at the time of the
settlement

05:44:35.788 --> 05:44:35.798 align:start position:0%
settlement
 
05:44:38.590 --> 05:44:38.600 align:start position:0%
agreement uh the wide range really still
 
05:44:41.070 --> 05:44:41.080 align:start position:0%
considers uh the many uncertainties we
 
05:44:43.190 --> 05:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
have with past treatment as well so over
 
05:44:45.708 --> 05:44:45.718 align:start position:0%
the next 20 years we're projecting that
 
05:44:48.150 --> 05:44:48.160 align:start position:0%
CCO Bain's portion represents about 6 to
 
05:44:50.230 --> 05:44:50.240 align:start position:0%
177% of what we now believe the actual
 
05:44:53.670 --> 05:44:53.680 align:start position:0%
past on andm cost will be um the cost to
 
05:44:56.110 --> 05:44:56.120 align:start position:0%
MVD over 20 years we're projecting to be
 
05:44:59.468 --> 05:44:59.478 align:start position:0%
between 2.6 or 8.5 million for oper
 
05:45:02.350 --> 05:45:02.360 align:start position:0%
ations so after four and a half years um
 
05:45:03.868 --> 05:45:03.878 align:start position:0%
of the wells being offline the good news
 
05:45:05.510 --> 05:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
is the facility is working the plant
 
05:45:08.110 --> 05:45:08.120 align:start position:0%
went online four months ago and is
 
05:45:09.430 --> 05:45:09.440 align:start position:0%
currently producing water with no
 
05:45:11.270 --> 05:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
detection of past the bad news is the
 
05:45:13.990 --> 05:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
capital cost and significantly more than
 
05:45:16.070 --> 05:45:16.080 align:start position:0%
what was anticipated and the operation
 
05:45:19.670 --> 05:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
costs are uh as well so uh hopefully
 
05:45:20.990 --> 05:45:21.000 align:start position:0%
that helps just at least put some
 
05:45:22.548 --> 05:45:22.558 align:start position:0%
perspective on the on the magnitude of
 
05:45:24.030 --> 05:45:24.040 align:start position:0%
cost and I'd be happy to answer any
 
05:45:26.150 --> 05:45:26.160 align:start position:0%
questions and thank you thank you very
 
05:45:27.910 --> 05:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony representative
 
05:45:27.920 --> 05:45:32.510 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony representative
Chase

05:45:32.510 --> 05:45:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:34.310 --> 05:45:34.320 align:start position:0%
can you hear me all right we can hear
 
05:45:38.030 --> 05:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
you excellent It's About Time thank you
 
05:45:39.788 --> 05:45:39.798 align:start position:0%
for taking my question and if you're not
 
05:45:41.590 --> 05:45:41.600 align:start position:0%
the right one maybe somebody can help me
 
05:45:43.190 --> 05:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
with this so as I'm sitting here
 
05:45:45.468 --> 05:45:45.478 align:start position:0%
listening and I'm
 
05:45:49.390 --> 05:45:49.400 align:start position:0%
uh very concerned about the water safety
 
05:45:51.990 --> 05:45:52.000 align:start position:0%
and what what could happen in the future
 
05:45:54.628 --> 05:45:54.638 align:start position:0%
where there is this town Hosk Falls in
 
05:45:56.468 --> 05:45:56.478 align:start position:0%
New York and there's been a state a
 
05:45:58.468 --> 05:45:58.478 align:start position:0%
state walk and we're finding out all
 
05:45:58.478 --> 05:46:00.430 align:start position:0%
state walk and we're finding out all
this

05:46:00.430 --> 05:46:00.440 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:46:02.708 --> 05:46:02.718 align:start position:0%
information is there some type of an
 
05:46:05.468 --> 05:46:05.478 align:start position:0%
agreement that the marrat can look at
 
05:46:09.270 --> 05:46:09.280 align:start position:0%
that um hosek Falls has with s Kain and
 
05:46:11.948 --> 05:46:11.958 align:start position:0%
how they how long they're going to be
 
05:46:13.830 --> 05:46:13.840 align:start position:0%
helping them and changing these uh
 
05:46:17.548 --> 05:46:17.558 align:start position:0%
filters and you know if there's already
 
05:46:19.628 --> 05:46:19.638 align:start position:0%
agreement and and there was a little bit
 
05:46:22.788 --> 05:46:22.798 align:start position:0%
of of concern that maybe they took
 
05:46:25.750 --> 05:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
advantage of maram residents because of
 
05:46:28.430 --> 05:46:28.440 align:start position:0%
the heightened problem that first
 
05:46:30.150 --> 05:46:30.160 align:start position:0%
started when it was
 
05:46:32.708 --> 05:46:32.718 align:start position:0%
approached can it just be reviewed and
 
05:46:34.670 --> 05:46:34.680 align:start position:0%
looked at and maybe us some of the
 
05:46:37.110 --> 05:46:37.120 align:start position:0%
language or some of the the um the the
 
05:46:39.030 --> 05:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
follow through with maybe I'm assuming
 
05:46:40.910 --> 05:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
it's an insurance company who's paying
 
05:46:43.788 --> 05:46:43.798 align:start position:0%
this and now be able to put that into
 
05:46:43.798 --> 05:46:44.548 align:start position:0%
this and now be able to put that into
the

05:46:44.548 --> 05:46:44.558 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:46:44.558 --> 05:46:47.868 align:start position:0%
the
marac

05:46:47.868 --> 05:46:47.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:51.350 --> 05:46:51.360 align:start position:0%
needs you get does that make sense get
 
05:46:53.830 --> 05:46:53.840 align:start position:0%
that question Mr Pratt I'm yes thank you
 
05:46:55.510 --> 05:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
for the question and I and I understand
 
05:46:57.430 --> 05:46:57.440 align:start position:0%
and I can't speak to the document itself
 
05:46:59.468 --> 05:46:59.478 align:start position:0%
but I do know the document exists and I
 
05:47:02.150 --> 05:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
do believe the marac has a copy of that
 
05:47:04.070 --> 05:47:04.080 align:start position:0%
document there is an agreement between
 
05:47:05.868 --> 05:47:05.878 align:start position:0%
sanco ban and the parties associated
 
05:47:08.910 --> 05:47:08.920 align:start position:0%
with the HK Falls so that does
 
05:47:12.110 --> 05:47:12.120 align:start position:0%
exist okay I guess that's there any
 
05:47:13.750 --> 05:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
other questions from Mr
 
05:47:15.868 --> 05:47:15.878 align:start position:0%
Pratt seeing none thank you for your
 
05:47:19.590 --> 05:47:19.600 align:start position:0%
testimony today thank you okay and there
 
05:47:22.468 --> 05:47:22.478 align:start position:0%
is a uh we have three more people who
 
05:47:24.750 --> 05:47:24.760 align:start position:0%
pre- registered to testify all
 
05:47:28.350 --> 05:47:28.360 align:start position:0%
testifying in support of the legislation
 
05:47:36.788 --> 05:47:36.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:40.590 --> 05:47:40.600 align:start position:0%
Allen hi can you hear me you can well
 
05:47:44.150 --> 05:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for hearing or plea
 
05:47:46.990 --> 05:47:47.000 align:start position:0%
and I must say I feel really bad that
 
05:47:49.350 --> 05:47:49.360 align:start position:0%
your heads are exploding with what we
 
05:47:51.468 --> 05:47:51.478 align:start position:0%
and meramac have been dealing with since
 
05:47:54.590 --> 05:47:54.600 align:start position:0%
2016 I know this is complex I know
 
05:47:57.310 --> 05:47:57.320 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of layers and I do
 
05:47:59.230 --> 05:47:59.240 align:start position:0%
understand what you're trying to do here
 
05:48:01.628 --> 05:48:01.638 align:start position:0%
and your job in determining if you are
 
05:48:03.910 --> 05:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
the place to deal with this or it should
 
05:48:06.510 --> 05:48:06.520 align:start position:0%
be pursued privately I hear that as I'm
 
05:48:08.910 --> 05:48:08.920 align:start position:0%
listening so for the record my name is
 
05:48:11.190 --> 05:48:11.200 align:start position:0%
Loren Allen I have been a resident of
 
05:48:13.270 --> 05:48:13.280 align:start position:0%
meramac since
 
05:48:16.310 --> 05:48:16.320 align:start position:0%
1985 uh I am a co-founder of a citizen
 
05:48:19.350 --> 05:48:19.360 align:start position:0%
group that I never set out in life to do
 
05:48:21.230 --> 05:48:21.240 align:start position:0%
uh but myself and other members of the
 
05:48:24.310 --> 05:48:24.320 align:start position:0%
community uh became very concerned in
 
05:48:28.070 --> 05:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
2016 over um something that pertains
 
05:48:30.750 --> 05:48:30.760 align:start position:0%
specifically to this bill what we would
 
05:48:33.590 --> 05:48:33.600 align:start position:0%
expect to be happening and what we'd
 
05:48:36.948 --> 05:48:36.958 align:start position:0%
expect to see moving forward given
 
05:48:38.868 --> 05:48:38.878 align:start position:0%
discovery of contamination of public
 
05:48:41.548 --> 05:48:41.558 align:start position:0%
water and what we were actually seeing
 
05:48:43.548 --> 05:48:43.558 align:start position:0%
so we have done a lot of work as a
 
05:48:46.350 --> 05:48:46.360 align:start position:0%
community we have done a lot of advocacy
 
05:48:48.628 --> 05:48:48.638 align:start position:0%
and we have taken on roles that we never
 
05:48:51.270 --> 05:48:51.280 align:start position:0%
thought we would so this bill um was
 
05:48:54.190 --> 05:48:54.200 align:start position:0%
brought about by citizen initiative um
 
05:48:56.910 --> 05:48:56.920 align:start position:0%
the late representative hinch graciously
 
05:49:00.270 --> 05:49:00.280 align:start position:0%
and you know beautifully tuned into this
 
05:49:03.110 --> 05:49:03.120 align:start position:0%
issue and met many many occasions with
 
05:49:05.510 --> 05:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
our citizen group we also invited Town
 
05:49:08.430 --> 05:49:08.440 align:start position:0%
Council Members commissioners of the MVD
 
05:49:11.150 --> 05:49:11.160 align:start position:0%
public at large um elected officials our
 
05:49:13.230 --> 05:49:13.240 align:start position:0%
state senators even our federal
 
05:49:15.948 --> 05:49:15.958 align:start position:0%
delegation so we've had community
 
05:49:18.708 --> 05:49:18.718 align:start position:0%
meeting in sitdown after sitdown so the
 
05:49:20.750 --> 05:49:20.760 align:start position:0%
long and short of it is back in
 
05:49:23.590 --> 05:49:23.600 align:start position:0%
2016 um you've heard several people
 
05:49:25.750 --> 05:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
testifying referring to this letter that
 
05:49:28.070 --> 05:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
Dees set out you know basically laying
 
05:49:31.110 --> 05:49:31.120 align:start position:0%
out there expectations of s gobain to uh
 
05:49:33.390 --> 05:49:33.400 align:start position:0%
make right the situation at Wells 4 and
 
05:49:36.350 --> 05:49:36.360 align:start position:0%
five uh so we believe that was to be
 
05:49:38.670 --> 05:49:38.680 align:start position:0%
happening and what happened in this
 
05:49:40.430 --> 05:49:40.440 align:start position:0%
process is there were supposed to be
 
05:49:42.830 --> 05:49:42.840 align:start position:0%
some temporary filters that were
 
05:49:44.230 --> 05:49:44.240 align:start position:0%
supposed to actually come to New
 
05:49:46.990 --> 05:49:47.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire from HK Falls New York this is
 
05:49:49.230 --> 05:49:49.240 align:start position:0%
what kind of got us involved with HK
 
05:49:50.868 --> 05:49:50.878 align:start position:0%
falls in the first place and we're like
 
05:49:53.750 --> 05:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
wh what's that about turns out HK Falls
 
05:49:56.750 --> 05:49:56.760 align:start position:0%
shares a a polluter with us and S oain
 
05:49:58.990 --> 05:49:59.000 align:start position:0%
had immediately installed a temporary
 
05:50:01.910 --> 05:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
filter system until they could install a
 
05:50:04.510 --> 05:50:04.520 align:start position:0%
permanent one which they have done and
 
05:50:06.310 --> 05:50:06.320 align:start position:0%
we were told that these filters were
 
05:50:09.350 --> 05:50:09.360 align:start position:0%
coming to miramac very shortly and a
 
05:50:11.310 --> 05:50:11.320 align:start position:0%
month went by two months went by six
 
05:50:13.628 --> 05:50:13.638 align:start position:0%
months went by in the meantime what
 
05:50:16.110 --> 05:50:16.120 align:start position:0%
happened is we didn't know they were
 
05:50:18.150 --> 05:50:18.160 align:start position:0%
getting you know their negotiation push
 
05:50:20.510 --> 05:50:20.520 align:start position:0%
back with HK Falls was getting a little
 
05:50:23.708 --> 05:50:23.718 align:start position:0%
tense and um I think what was going on
 
05:50:27.110 --> 05:50:27.120 align:start position:0%
there was kind of fueling the resolve on
 
05:50:29.548 --> 05:50:29.558 align:start position:0%
this end as s go Bain you know a
 
05:50:31.948 --> 05:50:31.958 align:start position:0%
multi-billion dollar international
 
05:50:33.750 --> 05:50:33.760 align:start position:0%
corporation if you just look them up and
 
05:50:35.310 --> 05:50:35.320 align:start position:0%
see how many dots they have on the map
 
05:50:37.468 --> 05:50:37.478 align:start position:0%
in New England and North America alone
 
05:50:40.708 --> 05:50:40.718 align:start position:0%
it's immense um so you know I'm a
 
05:50:42.788 --> 05:50:42.798 align:start position:0%
business owner in New Hampshire and I do
 
05:50:45.350 --> 05:50:45.360 align:start position:0%
understand liability is part of what we
 
05:50:47.468 --> 05:50:47.478 align:start position:0%
do have to consider you know in every
 
05:50:49.990 --> 05:50:50.000 align:start position:0%
business whether large or small like my
 
05:50:53.150 --> 05:50:53.160 align:start position:0%
own so I I do understand this on their
 
05:50:56.190 --> 05:50:56.200 align:start position:0%
point of view is about liability um you
 
05:50:59.390 --> 05:50:59.400 align:start position:0%
know control and I firmly believe that
 
05:51:01.868 --> 05:51:01.878 align:start position:0%
in restricting this agreement and
 
05:51:04.310 --> 05:51:04.320 align:start position:0%
limiting it to the five years they feel
 
05:51:06.150 --> 05:51:06.160 align:start position:0%
that you know it's no acknowledgement of
 
05:51:08.390 --> 05:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
harm they're doing it in good faith and
 
05:51:09.830 --> 05:51:09.840 align:start position:0%
then boom they can wash their hands of
 
05:51:12.510 --> 05:51:12.520 align:start position:0%
it so their ultimate goal is not to be
 
05:51:15.830 --> 05:51:15.840 align:start position:0%
responsible for damages or medical
 
05:51:19.110 --> 05:51:19.120 align:start position:0%
claims or medical monitoring clearly for
 
05:51:21.310 --> 05:51:21.320 align:start position:0%
years you know these chemicals cause a
 
05:51:23.270 --> 05:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
Havoc of health issues they play out
 
05:51:25.750 --> 05:51:25.760 align:start position:0%
through the lifetime decade after decade
 
05:51:28.868 --> 05:51:28.878 align:start position:0%
and you know if if we were to uh you
 
05:51:31.230 --> 05:51:31.240 align:start position:0%
know be granted uh Health monitoring or
 
05:51:32.868 --> 05:51:32.878 align:start position:0%
something like that you know this is
 
05:51:35.788 --> 05:51:35.798 align:start position:0%
this is a can of worms here we have
 
05:51:38.430 --> 05:51:38.440 align:start position:0%
25,500 members of the miramac community
 
05:51:41.430 --> 05:51:41.440 align:start position:0%
who use MVD water so let me step back
 
05:51:42.868 --> 05:51:42.878 align:start position:0%
for a second and I don't know how many
 
05:51:44.310 --> 05:51:44.320 align:start position:0%
of you have driven up and down Dani
 
05:51:46.670 --> 05:51:46.680 align:start position:0%
Webster Highway ever so we have kind of
 
05:51:49.110 --> 05:51:49.120 align:start position:0%
SLE Bane in the northeast corner of
 
05:51:51.590 --> 05:51:51.600 align:start position:0%
meramac uh behind them is the meramac
 
05:51:53.868 --> 05:51:53.878 align:start position:0%
river they're on Dani Webster Highway if
 
05:51:56.670 --> 05:51:56.680 align:start position:0%
we travel South on that road a bit in
 
05:51:58.670 --> 05:51:58.680 align:start position:0%
between Seno Bane and well Wells four
 
05:52:00.830 --> 05:52:00.840 align:start position:0%
and five Wells four and five are due
 
05:52:03.270 --> 05:52:03.280 align:start position:0%
south of s gobain you know I don't have
 
05:52:05.150 --> 05:52:05.160 align:start position:0%
to be a hydrogeologist to know which way
 
05:52:07.708 --> 05:52:07.718 align:start position:0%
water flows I've I've kayaked and canoed
 
05:52:09.750 --> 05:52:09.760 align:start position:0%
and understand rivers and Brooks and all
 
05:52:12.750 --> 05:52:12.760 align:start position:0%
that stuff so in between Senco ban I
 
05:52:15.110 --> 05:52:15.120 align:start position:0%
don't want to short but I you know we've
 
05:52:16.868 --> 05:52:16.878 align:start position:0%
got it we've had I think we've got
 
05:52:18.788 --> 05:52:18.798 align:start position:0%
filled in you know with a with all the
 
05:52:21.030 --> 05:52:21.040 align:start position:0%
other testimony we've had with regard to
 
05:52:23.468 --> 05:52:23.478 align:start position:0%
the pollution and the effect those
 
05:52:25.190 --> 05:52:25.200 align:start position:0%
things well we I think what we really
 
05:52:27.670 --> 05:52:27.680 align:start position:0%
need to address or focus on at this
 
05:52:28.750 --> 05:52:28.760 align:start position:0%
point in time
 
05:52:31.868 --> 05:52:31.878 align:start position:0%
is why the legislature should get
 
05:52:35.190 --> 05:52:35.200 align:start position:0%
involved time with what was a private
 
05:52:37.430 --> 05:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
contract in the past I'll give you my
 
05:52:40.948 --> 05:52:40.958 align:start position:0%
pitch I gotcha so um two issues were
 
05:52:42.868 --> 05:52:42.878 align:start position:0%
raised somebody earlier in this hearing
 
05:52:45.270 --> 05:52:45.280 align:start position:0%
one one of your Comm Comm members raised
 
05:52:47.868 --> 05:52:47.878 align:start position:0%
the issue of um shared responsibility I
 
05:52:49.788 --> 05:52:49.798 align:start position:0%
thought that speech was very interesting
 
05:52:52.948 --> 05:52:52.958 align:start position:0%
because what he stated was very similar
 
05:52:56.350 --> 05:52:56.360 align:start position:0%
to what s gobain argued back in 2016
 
05:53:00.310 --> 05:53:00.320 align:start position:0%
which is why the negoti s for MVD in St
 
05:53:02.270 --> 05:53:02.280 align:start position:0%
gobain went behind closed doors they
 
05:53:04.708 --> 05:53:04.718 align:start position:0%
asked for a closed door uh mediation
 
05:53:06.948 --> 05:53:06.958 align:start position:0%
process the public was not happy none of
 
05:53:09.430 --> 05:53:09.440 align:start position:0%
us the Town Council the Town members
 
05:53:12.910 --> 05:53:12.920 align:start position:0%
because we no longer got to be privy to
 
05:53:15.270 --> 05:53:15.280 align:start position:0%
what was being decided that impacted us
 
05:53:17.948 --> 05:53:17.958 align:start position:0%
every day so what happened is they went
 
05:53:19.868 --> 05:53:19.878 align:start position:0%
into that mediation process or
 
05:53:21.830 --> 05:53:21.840 align:start position:0%
Commissioners are no longer in office
 
05:53:23.270 --> 05:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
they were members of the public they
 
05:53:25.310 --> 05:53:25.320 align:start position:0%
were older gentlemen at that point they
 
05:53:27.670 --> 05:53:27.680 align:start position:0%
were being told Nothing by the state of
 
05:53:29.430 --> 05:53:29.440 align:start position:0%
the federal government as the qualities
 
05:53:31.468 --> 05:53:31.478 align:start position:0%
of these chemicals they didn't really
 
05:53:34.350 --> 05:53:34.360 align:start position:0%
know anything and they were assured um
 
05:53:35.868 --> 05:53:35.878 align:start position:0%
that they could handle this the state
 
05:53:38.390 --> 05:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
kind of backed out and left them to it
 
05:53:41.030 --> 05:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
so it really isn't right so at this
 
05:53:43.270 --> 05:53:43.280 align:start position:0%
point uh the settlement agreement that
 
05:53:45.948 --> 05:53:45.958 align:start position:0%
they they finally did after two years uh
 
05:53:47.628 --> 05:53:47.638 align:start position:0%
one of the Commissioners when he retired
 
05:53:50.190 --> 05:53:50.200 align:start position:0%
said to me I feel really bad at this
 
05:53:51.868 --> 05:53:51.878 align:start position:0%
point because we know so much more but
 
05:53:53.430 --> 05:53:53.440 align:start position:0%
we couldn't we couldn't get anything
 
05:53:56.350 --> 05:53:56.360 align:start position:0%
else agreed to we just couldn't so
 
05:53:58.590 --> 05:53:58.600 align:start position:0%
there's been Avenues looked at someone
 
05:54:00.868 --> 05:54:00.878 align:start position:0%
earlier talked about meeting with uh the
 
05:54:03.150 --> 05:54:03.160 align:start position:0%
governor actually the governor the um
 
05:54:05.628 --> 05:54:05.638 align:start position:0%
Assistant Attorney General and Dees
 
05:54:07.830 --> 05:54:07.840 align:start position:0%
meeting to look at what we have for
 
05:54:11.190 --> 05:54:11.200 align:start position:0%
recourse um we have asked you know
 
05:54:12.910 --> 05:54:12.920 align:start position:0%
environmental Attorneys at a Citizens
 
05:54:15.190 --> 05:54:15.200 align:start position:0%
group uh we took citizens initiative
 
05:54:17.948 --> 05:54:17.958 align:start position:0%
because this is the only Avenue we have
 
05:54:21.110 --> 05:54:21.120 align:start position:0%
we have no legal recourse whatsoever to
 
05:54:23.510 --> 05:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
enter to look at this agreement MVD
 
05:54:25.990 --> 05:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
cannot Advocate they cannot go to court
 
05:54:28.708 --> 05:54:28.718 align:start position:0%
and say hey we have more information now
 
05:54:30.990 --> 05:54:31.000 align:start position:0%
and we want this looked at what you have
 
05:54:33.430 --> 05:54:33.440 align:start position:0%
suggested here are very good suggestions
 
05:54:35.270 --> 05:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
and we as a community have looked at
 
05:54:38.948 --> 05:54:38.958 align:start position:0%
those uh venues for many many years and
 
05:54:40.948 --> 05:54:40.958 align:start position:0%
unfortunately none of them are possible
 
05:54:44.548 --> 05:54:44.558 align:start position:0%
EPA region one um is aware of or wo
 
05:54:46.830 --> 05:54:46.840 align:start position:0%
we've met with them on several occasions
 
05:54:49.070 --> 05:54:49.080 align:start position:0%
what they have stated to us is your
 
05:54:52.150 --> 05:54:52.160 align:start position:0%
state has the authority uh we have um is
 
05:54:56.390 --> 05:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
it RSA for the Clean Water 485 I believe
 
05:54:59.030 --> 05:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
it is uh that RSA that someone referred
 
05:55:00.628 --> 05:55:00.638 align:start position:0%
to I don't have the number because it's
 
05:55:02.868 --> 05:55:02.878 align:start position:0%
similar to this one uh gives them the
 
05:55:06.070 --> 05:55:06.080 align:start position:0%
authority the state has the authority so
 
05:55:08.430 --> 05:55:08.440 align:start position:0%
um the assistant Commissioner of Dees uh
 
05:55:10.750 --> 05:55:10.760 align:start position:0%
who has since retired said to us in a
 
05:55:13.270 --> 05:55:13.280 align:start position:0%
community meeting uh when we posed that
 
05:55:15.548 --> 05:55:15.558 align:start position:0%
question to him we said EPA says you
 
05:55:17.030 --> 05:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
have the authority to do whatever we
 
05:55:19.390 --> 05:55:19.400 align:start position:0%
need and whatever it takes he said well
 
05:55:20.990 --> 05:55:21.000 align:start position:0%
we technically do but here in New
 
05:55:23.030 --> 05:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we don't like to overstep we
 
05:55:24.948 --> 05:55:24.958 align:start position:0%
have a good partnership and working
 
05:55:27.270 --> 05:55:27.280 align:start position:0%
relationship with businesses I
 
05:55:28.670 --> 05:55:28.680 align:start position:0%
understand that he said we can get
 
05:55:31.310 --> 05:55:31.320 align:start position:0%
further that way by litigation and it's
 
05:55:34.230 --> 05:55:34.240 align:start position:0%
cheaper I understand that also um I
 
05:55:36.590 --> 05:55:36.600 align:start position:0%
understand his point of view he said but
 
05:55:38.948 --> 05:55:38.958 align:start position:0%
uh we're not going to take action unless
 
05:55:41.430 --> 05:55:41.440 align:start position:0%
we're legislated to do so that was a
 
05:55:43.590 --> 05:55:43.600 align:start position:0%
very very clear statement that was made
 
05:55:46.468 --> 05:55:46.478 align:start position:0%
to our community on many many occasions
 
05:55:48.590 --> 05:55:48.600 align:start position:0%
so the long and short of it is you know
 
05:55:50.830 --> 05:55:50.840 align:start position:0%
forever chemicals the wells are just
 
05:55:53.230 --> 05:55:53.240 align:start position:0%
south of s goane the numbers have gone
 
05:55:58.150 --> 05:55:58.160 align:start position:0%
up on-site numbers on slean 69,500 part
 
05:56:01.190 --> 05:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
per trillion pfoa alone in their
 
05:56:02.990 --> 05:56:03.000 align:start position:0%
groundwater in their ground monitoring
 
05:56:06.030 --> 05:56:06.040 align:start position:0%
Wells on their site just north of two of
 
05:56:09.310 --> 05:56:09.320 align:start position:0%
our public Wells so after five years we
 
05:56:12.110 --> 05:56:12.120 align:start position:0%
bear the cost of this as taxpayers and
 
05:56:15.110 --> 05:56:15.120 align:start position:0%
residents forever and they're basically
 
05:56:17.310 --> 05:56:17.320 align:start position:0%
off the hook so that that's really why
 
05:56:19.750 --> 05:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
we're coming to you here we really
 
05:56:21.750 --> 05:56:21.760 align:start position:0%
understand you're in a tough situation
 
05:56:24.990 --> 05:56:25.000 align:start position:0%
but we truly do not have a reason
 
05:56:28.150 --> 05:56:28.160 align:start position:0%
legitimately to file for reasons uh to
 
05:56:30.350 --> 05:56:30.360 align:start position:0%
nullify maybe a citizen group could I'm
 
05:56:31.990 --> 05:56:32.000 align:start position:0%
not really sure how to do that but the
 
05:56:35.430 --> 05:56:35.440 align:start position:0%
mvds hands are tied uh thank you thank
 
05:56:37.510 --> 05:56:37.520 align:start position:0%

today and again we're down to the last
 
05:56:56.788 --> 05:56:56.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:56.798 --> 05:57:01.910 align:start position:0%
 
Thomas

05:57:01.910 --> 05:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:04.270 --> 05:57:04.280 align:start position:0%
okay uh Mr chair and esteemed members of
 
05:57:06.830 --> 05:57:06.840 align:start position:0%
the Judiciary Committee I am former
 
05:57:08.910 --> 05:57:08.920 align:start position:0%
state representative Wendy Thomas from
 
05:57:11.190 --> 05:57:11.200 align:start position:0%
marac and I come before you in support
 
05:57:14.750 --> 05:57:14.760 align:start position:0%
of HB 478 which is a bill that enforces
 
05:57:17.350 --> 05:57:17.360 align:start position:0%
adequate and fair restitution from an
 
05:57:19.070 --> 05:57:19.080 align:start position:0%
industrial polluter towards those who
 
05:57:21.830 --> 05:57:21.840 align:start position:0%
have been adversely affected there are
 
05:57:23.310 --> 05:57:23.320 align:start position:0%
three points of this bill that I'd
 
05:57:25.788 --> 05:57:25.798 align:start position:0%
specifically like to address Point
 
05:57:28.628 --> 05:57:28.638 align:start position:0%
number one the history of the MV VD s
 
05:57:30.708 --> 05:57:30.718 align:start position:0%
CCO Bain settlement agreement for MVD
 
05:57:33.310 --> 05:57:33.320 align:start position:0%
public Wells 4 and5 which was signed in
 
05:57:34.948 --> 05:57:34.958 align:start position:0%
February of
 
05:57:37.910 --> 05:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
2018 the MVD s Coan settlement agreement
 
05:57:41.070 --> 05:57:41.080 align:start position:0%

parties in February
 
05:57:46.030 --> 05:57:46.040 align:start position:0%
2018 it was based on a preliminary
 
05:57:48.910 --> 05:57:48.920 align:start position:0%
treatment design a preliminary treatment
 
05:57:48.920 --> 05:57:49.990 align:start position:0%

05:57:54.468 --> 05:57:54.478 align:start position:0%
and maintenance cost estimates developed
 
05:57:56.708 --> 05:57:56.718 align:start position:0%
in 2016 and
 
05:57:59.948 --> 05:57:59.958 align:start position:0%
2017 that information is specific to the
 
05:58:02.548 --> 05:58:02.558 align:start position:0%
two parties and to MVD Wells four and
 
05:58:06.030 --> 05:58:06.040 align:start position:0%
five only the cost and other information
 
05:58:07.830 --> 05:58:07.840 align:start position:0%
used in that settlement agreement from
 
05:58:09.430 --> 05:58:09.440 align:start position:0%
2016 to
 
05:58:12.548 --> 05:58:12.558 align:start position:0%
2017 was sub subsequently found to be
 
05:58:14.628 --> 05:58:14.638 align:start position:0%
inaccurate and
 
05:58:17.390 --> 05:58:17.400 align:start position:0%
underestimated MVD needed to enter into
 
05:58:20.350 --> 05:58:20.360 align:start position:0%
settlement negotiations with st Cain
 
05:58:20.360 --> 05:58:21.310 align:start position:0%
settlement negotiations with st Cain
because

05:58:21.310 --> 05:58:21.320 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:58:24.230 --> 05:58:24.240 align:start position:0%
nhdes failed to take action to compel
 
05:58:26.270 --> 05:58:26.280 align:start position:0%
Senco Bain to pay for all of the
 
05:58:28.990 --> 05:58:29.000 align:start position:0%
necessary long term operation
 
05:58:31.310 --> 05:58:31.320 align:start position:0%
maintenance and monitoring of the
 
05:58:33.708 --> 05:58:33.718 align:start position:0%
installed treatment systems as demanded
 
05:58:36.708 --> 05:58:36.718 align:start position:0%
in the dees letter to S gobain on April
 
05:58:36.718 --> 05:58:38.590 align:start position:0%
in the dees letter to S gobain on April
1st

05:58:38.590 --> 05:58:38.600 align:start position:0%
1st
 
05:58:41.190 --> 05:58:41.200 align:start position:0%
2016 Point number two that I'd like to
 
05:58:44.868 --> 05:58:44.878 align:start position:0%
address concerns that passing HB 478
 
05:58:47.110 --> 05:58:47.120 align:start position:0%
will set a precedent that any settlement
 
05:58:49.548 --> 05:58:49.558 align:start position:0%
agreement can be changed by the
 
05:58:51.948 --> 05:58:51.958 align:start position:0%
legislature the uniqueness of this
 
05:58:54.670 --> 05:58:54.680 align:start position:0%
agreement resulting from de's failure to
 
05:58:57.150 --> 05:58:57.160 align:start position:0%
take enforcement action to is unique to
 
05:58:58.590 --> 05:58:58.600 align:start position:0%
this case
 
05:59:00.910 --> 05:59:00.920 align:start position:0%
this uniqueness has no bearing on any
 
05:59:03.190 --> 05:59:03.200 align:start position:0%
other settlement agreements and would
 
05:59:05.390 --> 05:59:05.400 align:start position:0%
therefore not set any precedent that
 
05:59:07.390 --> 05:59:07.400 align:start position:0%
they that the New Hampshire legislature
 
05:59:09.310 --> 05:59:09.320 align:start position:0%
can overturn any other settlement
 
05:59:10.628 --> 05:59:10.638 align:start position:0%
agreement brought
 
05:59:15.910 --> 05:59:15.920 align:start position:0%
forward this bill hb7 uh 478 was modeled
 
05:59:20.190 --> 05:59:20.200 align:start position:0%
after a similar Bill HB 494 which
 
05:59:22.230 --> 05:59:22.240 align:start position:0%
compelled the kley landfill group to
 
05:59:25.030 --> 05:59:25.040 align:start position:0%
work with the dees to reach a consent
 
05:59:27.948 --> 05:59:27.958 align:start position:0%
degree to design and implement certain
 
05:59:30.628 --> 05:59:30.638 align:start position:0%
groundwater remediations Associated
 
05:59:33.468 --> 05:59:33.478 align:start position:0%
costs and to establish a timetable to
 
05:59:33.478 --> 05:59:34.990 align:start position:0%
costs and to establish a timetable to
implement

05:59:34.990 --> 05:59:35.000 align:start position:0%
implement
 
05:59:37.430 --> 05:59:37.440 align:start position:0%
remediation if Dees had taken
 
05:59:39.468 --> 05:59:39.478 align:start position:0%
appropriate enforcement action pursuant
 
05:59:42.070 --> 05:59:42.080 align:start position:0%
to the dees letter to Senco Bain on
 
05:59:43.948 --> 05:59:43.958 align:start position:0%
April 1st
 
05:59:47.270 --> 05:59:47.280 align:start position:0%
2016 and if Dees would have compelled s
 
05:59:49.110 --> 05:59:49.120 align:start position:0%
Cain to pay for all of the necessary
 
05:59:52.150 --> 05:59:52.160 align:start position:0%
long-term operation maintenance and
 
05:59:54.350 --> 05:59:54.360 align:start position:0%
monitoring of the installed treatment
 
05:59:56.590 --> 05:59:56.600 align:start position:0%
systems as demanded in the letter there
 
05:59:59.750 --> 05:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
would be no need for this legislative
 
06:00:04.190 --> 06:00:04.200 align:start position:0%
action this bill is similar oh MBD has
 
06:00:06.750 --> 06:00:06.760 align:start position:0%
exhausted all other reasonable a Avenues
 
06:00:09.548 --> 06:00:09.558 align:start position:0%
to seek the restitution demanded by Dees
 
06:00:11.590 --> 06:00:11.600 align:start position:0%
in its a in its April letter to Senco
 
06:00:14.590 --> 06:00:14.600 align:start position:0%
bang MBD has met with the governor the
 
06:00:18.190 --> 06:00:18.200 align:start position:0%
AG and Dees and was incorrectly advised
 
06:00:20.990 --> 06:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
by Dees that they had no authority to
 
06:00:23.190 --> 06:00:23.200 align:start position:0%
compel St Cain to pay for all of the
 
06:00:24.910 --> 06:00:24.920 align:start position:0%
necessary long-term operation
 
06:00:26.868 --> 06:00:26.878 align:start position:0%
maintenance and monitoring of the
 
06:00:29.390 --> 06:00:29.400 align:start position:0%
installed treatment systems because Dees
 
06:00:32.510 --> 06:00:32.520 align:start position:0%
claimed it had no authority to negotiate
 
06:00:35.868 --> 06:00:35.878 align:start position:0%
on behalf of a village District MVD
 
06:00:37.868 --> 06:00:37.878 align:start position:0%
participated in and paid their
 
06:00:40.230 --> 06:00:40.240 align:start position:0%
consultant Underwood engineering uh
 
06:00:42.910 --> 06:00:42.920 align:start position:0%
Underwood Engineers Incorporated to
 
06:00:45.670 --> 06:00:45.680 align:start position:0%
update incorrect long-term operation and
 
06:00:48.070 --> 06:00:48.080 align:start position:0%
maintenance costs and negotiate with
 
06:00:50.150 --> 06:00:50.160 align:start position:0%
sanco Bain a second time to provide
 
06:00:53.030 --> 06:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
additional costs that should and would
 
06:00:55.590 --> 06:00:55.600 align:start position:0%
have been fully covered if Dees had
 
06:00:59.110 --> 06:00:59.120 align:start position:0%
enforced its April 1st 2016
 
06:01:02.990 --> 06:01:03.000 align:start position:0%
letter my last point point three is that
 
06:01:06.990 --> 06:01:07.000 align:start position:0%
this bill HB 478 will provide an Avenue
 
06:01:10.110 --> 06:01:10.120 align:start position:0%
like the kley landfill Bill to correct
 
06:01:13.468 --> 06:01:13.478 align:start position:0%
deficiencies by a responsible party and
 
06:01:15.868 --> 06:01:15.878 align:start position:0%
to require taking the necessary actions
 
06:01:17.190 --> 06:01:17.200 align:start position:0%
required by
 
06:01:19.750 --> 06:01:19.760 align:start position:0%
Dees although this bill would current
 
06:01:22.708 --> 06:01:22.718 align:start position:0%
currently help MVD it is important to
 
06:01:26.150 --> 06:01:26.160 align:start position:0%
have it in place so that if or when
 
06:01:28.708 --> 06:01:28.718 align:start position:0%
another town or water supplier is harmed
 
06:01:31.628 --> 06:01:31.638 align:start position:0%
by contamination from a polluter and
 
06:01:33.670 --> 06:01:33.680 align:start position:0%
that polluter is compelled to address
 
06:01:37.350 --> 06:01:37.360 align:start position:0%
and provide remedial activities by Dees
 
06:01:42.310 --> 06:01:42.320 align:start position:0%
but fails to do so or if Dees fails to
 
06:01:44.708 --> 06:01:44.718 align:start position:0%
take enforcement action in follow-up to
 
06:01:46.670 --> 06:01:46.680 align:start position:0%
a demand letter to a polluter for
 
06:01:49.990 --> 06:01:50.000 align:start position:0%
remedial action that town or water
 
06:01:52.548 --> 06:01:52.558 align:start position:0%
supplier will have an Avenue available
 
06:01:55.190 --> 06:01:55.200 align:start position:0%
to them similar to HB
 
06:01:57.948 --> 06:01:57.958 align:start position:0%
494 and HB
 
06:02:00.868 --> 06:02:00.878 align:start position:0%
478 to compel the polluter to take
 
06:02:03.990 --> 06:02:04.000 align:start position:0%
remedial action through an act of
 
06:02:06.628 --> 06:02:06.638 align:start position:0%
legislation for these reasons I urge you
 
06:02:08.830 --> 06:02:08.840 align:start position:0%
all to support House Bill
 
06:02:11.788 --> 06:02:11.798 align:start position:0%
478 which would require adequate and
 
06:02:15.230 --> 06:02:15.240 align:start position:0%
fair remedial action from an IND from an
 
06:02:17.670 --> 06:02:17.680 align:start position:0%
industrial polluter towards those who
 
06:02:20.708 --> 06:02:20.718 align:start position:0%
have been adversely affected please vote
 
06:02:23.788 --> 06:02:23.798 align:start position:0%
